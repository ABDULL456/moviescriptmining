{"test1_input": "JERGENS Joe Zack is a good prospect -- Exciting boy. \nAPOLLO ... Still don't feel no heat. \nJERGENS (sighs) Exactly what are you looking for, Apollo? \nAPOLLO ... This man. \nEverybody leans forward. \nAPOLLO (continuing; much amused) 'The Italian Stallion' -- He's my man. \nJERGENS Rocky Balboa -- His record's poor -- \nAPOLLO Don't matter -- That name. 'The Italian Stallion,' it's right on. (laughs) Who discovered America?  An Italian, right?  So, man, what could be better than to get it on with one of his ancestors -- \nTRAINER He won't last one round. \nAPOLLO Listen, I gonna carry this boy three rounds, then drop 'im like a bad habit. \nTRAINER I don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong. \nAPOLLO Southpaw, nuthin' -- I'll drop 'im in three -- 'Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion.' Shhiii -- Sounds like a damn monster movie!! \nEveryone laughs. \nFADE OUT. \nFADE IN: \nEXT. STREET - DUSK \nRocky and Paulie walk towards his house... Even though it is cold and dark, a group of kids conduct an energetic game of half-ball. (Half-ball is a variation of stick-ball.) \nROCKY (mimes throwing) I usta be deadly at half-ball. \nPAULIE I hate the friggin' game... I'd like to talk some business. \nROCKY What kinda business? \nPAULIE Look at my hands -- See how the joints are swollen. \nPaulie extends his thick hands and tries to make a fist. \nPAULIE (continuing) Inflamed joints -- Walkin' in an' out of a freezer carryin' meat plays hell on the joints. \nROCKY Maybe ya should see a doctor. \nPAULIE I don't need a doctor, I need a different job. \nROCKY Maybe another job is the best thing. \nPAULIE Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a friend an' would do a good job... Tell him I ain't bothered by nothin' an' would be a great collector... Bustin' bones don't bother me -- Tell him I'm a good worker. \nROCKY Gazzo's gotta come to you. \nPAULIE I'm askin' ya to go to him -- As a favor. \nROCKY Gazzo's gotta come to you -- Hey, Paulie, it's a bad job -- Do what you do now. \nEXT. ATOMIC HOAGIE SHOP - DUSK \nThey continue past the Atomic Hoagie Shoppe, Inc... A group of young men pitch quarters on the sidewalk out front. \nRocky pauses... He sees Marie, the little girl from the night before, hanging around with the guys.  She sees Rocky. \nMarie takes a deep drag on her cigarette and faces the opposite direction... The gang smiles and continues to pitch quarters. \nAnger and disappointment register across Rocky's face. \nPAULIE You know her? \nRocky shrugs and the two men move off... Filling the night air is the METALLIC SOUND of pitching QUARTERS. \nEXT. PAULIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThe men arrive at Paulie's home.  It is at the top of a dimly-lit four story walk-up. \nROCKY Ya sister knows I'm comin'? \n", "test1_true": "INT. PAULIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nPaulie unlocks the apartment door and enters... Rocky stiffly follows.  Paulie's sister steps out of the kitchen. A large serving spoon is in her hand... The TV is on. \nShe stops short and eyes Rocky... She is visibly unsettled by Rocky's unexpected presence. \nADRIAN (weakly) Paulie, you're late. \nShe looks at Rocky again. \nPAULIE Did you call the hospital? (to Rocky) If I'm ten minutes late, she calls the hospital. \nAdrian enters the bedroom and slams the door... Paulie follows.  An argument ensues and Rocky overhears. \nOVER the argument is HEARD a SPORTS BROADCAST rising from the TELEVISION. \nCOMMENTATOR (V.O.) ... Unfortunate luck for fifth-ranked heavyweight, Mac Lee Green.  The slugging fighter acquired a serious fracture in his left hand after an aggressive day of sparring -- Champion Apollo Creed says he'll be 'shopping for another victim,' to fill Green's vacancy for the Bicentennial Championship Fight to be held in Philly next month... By the way, rumor has it that this will be the most widely-viewed sporting event in the entire world -- and that includes the Super Bowl, folks... Today U.S. swimmers set a new... \nMeanwhile, the argument between brother and sister continues in the bedroom. \nADRIAN ... Paulie, why didn't you tell me you were bringing him home?!  Look at me, I'm not ready for this. \nPAULIE Like it would make a difference if you were, right?  This guy's a friend and now he's takin' ya out. \nADRIAN No... I can't! \nPAULIE Ya, ya goin' outta the bedroom an' I don't wanna know from nothin'. \nADRIAN Paulie, please -- \nPAULIE Hey, I want ya out instamaticly. -- I'm sicka lookin' at ya hangin' around like a friggin' spider -- Go out -- Live!  Do, enjoy life. \nADRIAN ... Like you? \nPAULIE Don't get wise with me.  I want ya to stop bein' a loser. \nADRIAN I can't go out. \nPAULIE Why? \nADRIAN Paulie, it's Thanksgiving. I've gotta turkey in the oven. \nPaulie turns and leaves the bedroom... He enters the kitchen. Grabbing a large fork, he opens the oven and spears the turkey... With the turkey suspended on the end of the fork, Paulie heaves the dripping bird out the window. \nAdrian has seen this and is shattered.  She runs back into the bedroom and locks the door. \nPAULIE !! Ya want the bird, go out in the alley an' eat the bird -- I want ya outta the house -- Enjoy ya friggin' life... Ya hungry, Rock? \nROCKY Maybe ya better forget it. \nPAULIE Forget nothin' -- Here, talk to my sister, tell 'er somethin' nice. \nRocky walks over to Adrian's bedroom door and begins speaking to the enclosed girl. \nROCKY ... Yo, Adrian, it's me, Rocky... Ah, ah -- Ah, it's kinda hard for me to think of somethin' to say, y'know -- 'Cause I never talked to a door before, I mean whatta ya say to a door. \nRocky turns away and begins to walk off. \nROCKY (continuing) ... Maybe I better forget it. \nPAULIE Try again, c'mon, try again. \nRocky goes over to the door and begins speaking again. \nROCKY Ah, Adrian, I know ya ain't too happy at this moment, but would ya do me a favor -- I ain't got nobody to spend Thanksgivin' with -- How 'bout you an' me goin' out -- Get somethin' to eat, maybe laugh a little, who knows... Would ya like, I dunno, go out together? \nAdrian opens the door... She already has her winter coat on. \nROCKY (continuing) We'll have a good time. \nPaulie opens the front door and gives Rocky an encouraging smile... \nROCKY (continuing) What's ya sister like to do? \nPAULIE Ice skate. \nROCKY I didn't want no turkey anyway. \n", "test1_id": 2697, "test2_input": "ROCKY Hey, who cared about me yesterday, huh?  Nobody -- I think I'm gonna train myself. \nPAULIE Without havin' good people around, ya won't have such a good chance. \nAdrian is not happy with her brother's overbearing attitude. She faces him. \nADRIAN Einstein flunked out of school... twice. \nPAULIE That so. \nADRIAN Roosevelt finished last in his class -- Beethoven was deaf, an' Helen Keller was blind -- I think Rocky has a good chance. \nINT. HALLWAY OF PAULIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nRocky stands in Adrian's doorway.  He kisses her. \nROCKY See ya tomorrow. \nRocky moves down the stairway and continues to do so as he converses with Adrian who remains upstairs.  His VOICE ECHOES up the stairwell. \nROCKY (continuing) How'd ya like hearin' ya name on TV? \nADRIAN I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that? \nROCKY Ya puttin' me on, right? \nADRIAN (smiles) Absolutely -- What time should I expect you? \nROCKY 'Bout seven. \nADRIAN I'll be waiting. \nRocky is now on the ground floor yelling up to Adrian on the top floor landing. \nROCKY Y'know how I said that stuff on television didn't bother me? \nADRIAN Yes. \nROCKY It did. \nAs Rocky completes the last word, he exits the building and slams the door which RESOUNDS throughout the apartment house. \nEXT. ATOMIC HOAGIE SHOP - NIGHT \nGazzo, the bodyguard, and Rocky are standing out front. They are eating hot sandwiches. \nROCKY Y'know I won't be able to work for ya no more. \nGAZZO Hey -- if a good man can make a better life, let him make it. \nROCKY I feel bad about walkin'. \nGAZZO Take your shot, kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses? \nROCKY A few bucks. \nGazzo takes out a wad and peels off several bills. \nGAZZO Here's five hundred -- Put it in your glove. \nROCKY Do I have to pay juice? \nGazzo looks at the Bodyguard and shakes his head as if to imply, \"Why's this guy asking such a foolish question?\" \nGazzo and the bodyguard step to the white Caddy parked at the curb.  They enter the cab.  Rocky watches. \nINT. CAR - NIGHT \nGAZZO (smiles) Does Santa Claus charge juice? Merry Christmas -- Now, how's about my present, ya gonna win? \nROCKY Gonna try. \nGAZZO Listen, kid, I'm with ya.  Ya know, I'm with ya -- Italian, we're blood.  You kill this rug -- We Guinneas gotta show these Afro-Americans where it's at.  Give it your best shot cause I want ya to prove to these bums on the corner that my man can't be beat by this rug... Ya got any action on the side. \nROCKY No action. \nGAZZO Ya gettin 150 grand killer. Ya got any plans for it? Whatta ya think? (MORE) \nGAZZO (CONT'D) Ya like to put it on the street, make it work for ya? \n", "test2_true": "GAZZO Sure, you do what ya want. Stay away from the stock market. \nROCKY Black market? \nGAZZO Same thing.  Ya know, Rock, remember when we was kids, we fought together.  An' I wasn't well an' ya had to beat up that Irish kid -- what's his name? -- Gallager -- I bought a suit and became a businessman. You put on gloves.  An' I remember Mama almost cried, may she rest in peace -- an' our ol' man who said ya had no brains -- I'd like to lay hands on that bastard.  You ain't never had any luck. Even when I owned you in '66 you never had luck.  But now I think you might be gettin' some luck kid.  Whatta you think? \nRocky smiles and Gazzo gets into his car.  Rocky follows him across the street. \nROCKY Yo, you gonna show, Tony? \nGAZZO Where else am I gonna go. (to Bodyguard) Bet three grand on Rocky. \nBODYGUARD He's a bum -- are you kiddin? \nGAZZO (slaps Bodyguard) No!  I'm not kiddin! \nRocky walks away. \nINT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nRocky returns home and enters his apartment.  After turning on the light, he flips on his RECORD PLAYER.  He now feeds the turtles. \nROCKY Look who's home! \nRocky notices two telegrams laying inside the threshold.  He approaches them with a sense of awe.  He opens and reads one. Settling on the bed, he reads the other. \nA KNOCK is HEARD.  Rocky opens the door.  Mickey Goldmill, the gym owner, stands framed in the doorway. \nMICKEY (stiffly) I seen the light.  I figure somebody was home. \nROCKY Hey, Mickey -- Whatta ya doin' here?  Here, sit down. \nRocky tosses soiled clothing off a mangled armchair. \nROCKY (continuing) Best seat in the house -- Hey, Mick, this is too much. \nMICKEY How do you mean? \nROCKY I'm usta seein' ya at the gym, but seein' ya here, in my house, it's kinda outta joint. \nBy the manner in which Goldmill listens, it is obvious something important is preying on his mind. \nRocky is slightly uncomfortable, almost embarrassed at having outsiders see how he lives. \nMICKEY Listen, Rock, you're a very lucky guy. \nROCKY Yeah. \nMICKEY What's happened is freak luck. \nROCKY Freak luck for sure. \nMICKEY Look at all them other fighters. Real good boys.  Good records. Colorful.  Fight their hearts out for peanuts -- But who cared?  Nobody.  They got it shoved in their back door. Nobody ever give them a shot at the title... \nROCKY (uneasy) Freak luck is a strange thing. \nMickey does not hear.  His attention is drawn to the turtles. \nMICKEY Whatta' those? \nROCKY Turtles -- domestic turtles. \nMICKEY (businesslike) I'm here tellin' ya to be very smart with this shot.  Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance. \nMickey looks hard into Rocky's eyes. \nMICKEY (continuing) Ya need a manager.  An advisor. I been in the racket fifty years.  I done it all, there ain't nothin' about the world of pugilism that ain't livin' up here. \nHe lights a half-smoked cigar. \nROCKY (at a loss) Fifty years, huh. \nMICKEY (stronger) Fifty years.  The rep is known around Philly, an' a good rep can't be bought, but I don't have to tell you that. \nROCKY How 'bout a glass of water? \nMICKEY Rocky, d'ya know what I done? \n", "test2_id": 2698, "test3_input": "DEMPSEY Good luck, kid. \nHe moves off. \nROCKY (to Mickey) Christ, Jack Dempsey. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nThe Announcer points and the timekeeper RINGS the BELL. \nANNOUNCER Former Middleweight Champion -- 'The Bronx Bull' -- Jake LaMotta! \nJAKE LA MOTTA raises his fist and gives best wishes to both contenders... Timekeeper RINGS the BELL. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nANNOUNCER (continuing) The man with the big punch -- Everybody's favorite, 'The Brown Bomber ' -- Joe Louis! \nJOE LOUIS bows and steps to Creed's corner.  Creed strikes a boxing pose and Louis tosses a playful punch. ROCKY They must be friends. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nANNOUNCER Now, last but certainly not least -- the former Heavyweight Champion, a son of Philly, Smoking Joe Frazier! \nFRAZIER rumbles to the center of the ring.  The CROWD CHEERS. Apollo puts on a show... He grimaces and gestures like he's going to attack Frazier.  His cornermen hold him back.  They laugh.  Frazier goes to Rocky's corner. \nFRAZIER Save some of him for me. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nThe Commentators beckon to Frazier as he exits the ring. \nCOMMENTATOR #1 The former champ looks great -- Can we get Joe over here -- here he comes. \nJoe Frazier stands in front of the Commentators. \nCOMMENTATOR #1 (continuing) Joe, what are your feelings about tonight's fight? \nFRAZIER Well, I think any man who works an' trains hard always gotta chance. \nCOMMENTATOR #2 You look in great shape, Joe. \nFRAZIER I'm always in shape. \nJoe laughs and exits.  The timekeeper RINGS the BELL. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nANNOUNCER ... Now for the evening's main event -- In the corner to my right, The Challenger, wearing white trunks -- At one hundred an' ninety-one pounds, one of Philly's own sons -- 'The Italian Stallion,' Rocky Balboa! \nA good CROWD RESPONSE. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nANNOUNCER In the far corner, wearing red, white an' blue -- Weighing in at two hundred and ten pounds -- Undefeated in forty- six fights -- the Heavyweight Champion of the World -- 'The Master of Disaster' -- Apollo Creed! \nThe arena EXPLODES and Creed puts on a display of hand speed. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nThe REFEREE motions to both fighters... They step to the center of the ring.  As the Referee explains the rules Apollo and Rocky stare hard into each other's eyes... The Referee's voice fades and the fighters' expressions fill the screen... Something soulful and frightening is being communicated. \nREFEREE ... Now come out fighting. \nThe fighters return to their corners. \nMICKEY God bless ya, Rock. \nROCKY Thanks, Mick -- I'm gonna try. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nThe BELL RINGS... Creed dances forward and boxes Rocky as though he considers the man an amateur. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nCOMMENTATOR #1 The Champ stings the slower challenger with jabs at will -- Balboa blocks eighty percent of the blows with his face -- Creed doesn't look the best he's ever been but is moving smoothly -- Creed snaps out a triple combination that backs Balboa into a corner -- oh, a solid hook by Creed, a master of fist-men. \nCOMMENTATOR #2 The Champion is smiling and toying with the man -- trying to give the fans their money's worth and make a show of it with the badly out-classes challenger -- Another left to right combination.  I feel sorry for -- \n", "test3_true": "ANOTHER ANGLE \nRocky suddenly explodes with an upswing hook to the jaw. Creed is dropped.  The arena EXPLODES.  Creed's eyes show disbelief.  So do Rocky's. \nRocky backs into his corner... Mickey and Mike yell at him. \nMICKEY You can do it!  Goddamnit, you got the power!  The body, get the body!!!  Ya got him goin'! \nREFEREE Six!... Seven!... Eight!... \nCreed is up... His playful attitude is gone... he is now all business.  His lightning jab stings Rocky's face repeatedly. \nAPOLLO ... Come at me, sucker! \nRocky charges and a terrific right crashes against Apollo's chin, followed by an uppercut to the liver that causes Creed to cringe... \nApollo counters with jabs and Rocky whips brutal combinations to the body. \nThe BELL RINGS. \nROCKY'S CORNER \nROCKY How am I doin'? \nMICKEY Real good. \nROCKY See how fast he is -- damn! \nMICKEY Breathe deep -- Keep ya chin down!!  Use the legs and drive through 'im.  Attack -- Attack -- Attack! \nAPOLLO'S CORNER \nApollo does not sit.  He stands and clowns with the spectators to prove he is not hurt. \nAPOLLO (to Trainer) ... That boy damn near broke my arm. \nTRAINER Sure -- He can hit -- Don't play no more -- Stick an' move, hear? \nAPOLLO I'll carry him 'till the third. \nTRAINER Don't play with this man, he's fightin' hard -- Let 'em feel some real heat! \nANOTHER ANGLE \nThe BELL for the second round RINGS... Rocky rushes out fast and furious.  Apollo melts out a left hook that raises a goose egg over Rocky's eye... Apollo employs footwork that dazzles Rocky.  He has class.  He studies Rocky and employs his lightning jab with cutting accuracy. Still Rocky shuffles ahead, bombarding Creed's midsection with hooks. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nThe round ends with Apollo assaulting Rocky with blinding combinations and delivering a stupendous right cross that flings Rocky into the ropes and shatters his nose... The round ends. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nApollo stands in his corner and jokes with the fans, but he is beginning to show the strain from the body punches. \nAPOLLO Man, I rearranged his face with that right -- The people love what's happenin' tonight. \nTRAINER People nothin', you in a fight, my man, -- ya best believe what you hear... Knock that boy out soon an' let's go home. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nRocky sits as Mickey and Benny try to reduce the swelling around his eyes... The nose is shattered. \nMICKEY Ya nose is broke. \nROCKY Damn!  How's it look? \nMICKEY Can't hardly tell.  Don't swallow the blood -- Go for his ribs.  Don't let 'im breathe. \nROCKY ... The guy's great. \nMICKEY Why don't ya tell 'im you're a fan! \nANOTHER ANGLE \nThe Commentators are caught up in the action.  They speak rapidly into their microphones. \nCOMMENTATOR #2 If you had asked anyone who knows boxing, they never would've predicted a first round knockdown and the second round punishment to the body of the Champion... Most fighters will tell you, receiving a good body punch is the next worst thing to dying. \n", "test3_id": 2699}

BLUE DOOR FIGHT CLUB - NIGHT \nSUPERIMPOSE OVER ACTION... \"NOVEMBER 12, 1975 - PHILADELPHIA\" \n... The club itself resembles a large unemptied trash-can. The boxing ring is extra small to insure constant battle. The lights overhead have barely enough wattage to see who is fighting. \nIn the ring are two heavyweights, one white the other black. The white fighter is ROCKY BALBOA.  He is thirty years old. His face is scarred and thick around the nose... His black hair shines and hangs in his eyes.  Rocky fights in a plodding, machine-like style.  The BLACK FIGHTER dances and bangs combinations into Rocky's face with great accuracy. But the punches do not even cause Rocky to blink... He grins at his opponent and keeps grinding ahead. \nThe people at ringside sit on folding chairs and clamor for blood... They lean out of their seats and heckle the fighters. In the thick smoke they resemble spectres.  Everyone is hustling bets... The action is even heavier in the balcony. A housewife yells for somebody to cover a two dollar bet. \nThe BELL RINGS and the fighters return to their corner... Somebody heaves a beer can into the ring. \nThe Black Fighter spits something red in a bucket and sneers across the ring at Rocky. \nBLACK FIGHTER (to cornerman) ... I'm gonna bust his head wide open! \nIn Rocky's corner he is being assisted by a shriveled, balding CORNERMAN, who is an employee of the club... He works on Rocky without any enthusiasm. \nCORNERMAN (lackluster) ... Ya waltzin' -- Give the suckers some action. \nROCKY Hey -- \nCORNERMAN (overriding) Ya movin' like a bum -- Want some advice -- \nROCKY ... Just gimme the water. \nA FIGHT FAN rushes up to Rocky... He is sixty-five, with yellow teeth and wearing sunglasses. \nFAN Should I bet the fight don't go the distance -- Ya feel strong? \nROCKY Absolutely. \nCORNERMAN ... Ya want some good advice? \nROCKY ... I just want the mouthpiece. \nThe BELL RINGS... Rocky makes the sign of the cross.  The fighters engage in battle.  The other fighter grabs Rocky in a clinch and purposely butts him... The butt opens a bleeding cut on the corner of Rocky's eye. \nRocky becomes furious over the foul and drives a flurry into the man's body... Rocky slams the man on the jaw and the fighter is out for the night.  The fans throw rubbish into the ring.  Rocky ignores it. \nThe fans loudly go about collecting bets.  The referee does not bother to even count the fighter out and drags him under the ropes where he is placed on a stretcher.  Two new fighters enter the ring.  Rocky slips on a tattered robe. Embroidered clumsily on the back is, \"The Italian Stallion.\" \nANNOUNCER Winner, Rocky Balboa -- Next a six rounder between local lightweights. \nWithout pomp Rocky climbs out of the ring and bums a cigarette from a spectator... The fighter on the stretcher passes behind him.  He watches for a moment and continues up the aisle... Before he even reaches the rear of the club the BELL RINGS and the next fight has already begun... Rocky fades into the darkness of the rear of the club. \nTHE TITLE CREDITS END: \nINT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT \nRocky has nearly completed dressing and reaches into his locker for his hat... Also in the dingy room are ten other fighters... Two taped fighters talk shop in the corner. \nFIGHTER #1 ... Tomorrow me an' my woman are gonna tip on down to Atlantic City, man. \nFIGHTER #2 ... It's cold, Bro'. \nFIGHTER #1 ... That's right, I got the city to myself... \nAnother paces nervously... Two other fighters shadowbox and spit nervously on the floor. \nA young pug combs his hair and listens to a portable RADIO that is BLASTING MUSIC. \nThe fighter that Rocky has just defeated is drinking a beer and joking with three other fighters... Some of the fighters are smoking.  The room is cloudy. \nA short man of fifty enters.  He is dressed in a sweater buttoned over a t-shirt. \nPROMOTER ...Balboa!? \nFATS Please, I need my hands to work -- Christ, don't bust my thumbs. \nAt wits' end the man picks up a large metal hook used by stevedores.  Rocky remains cool. \nROCKY Goin' fishin'? \nThe man drops the hook. \nROCKY What's ya name again? \nFATS Bob. \nROCKY Look, Bob, if ya wanna dance, ya gotta pay the band -- If ya borrow, ya gotta pay the man... Me, I ain't emotionally involved. \nRocky's determined expression strikes home.  The fat man quickly fumbles through his pockets and hands over a small wad of bills. \nROCKY (continuing; counting) A hundred an' thirty. \nFATS That's it, I'm broke. \nROCKY That's it? -- Completely? \nFATS That's it. \nROCKY What about for food an' stuff? \nFATS You have my food in ya hand. \nRocky looks almost sympathetically into the fat man's flushed expression. \nROCKY ... The juice is climbin' every week. \nFATS I know the juice is climbin' -- I been workin' six months just to pay the damn interest. \nROCKY Ya still light seventy. \nFATS Waits! -- Be smart.  Ya don't have to break nothin' -- Here, take my coat, it's worth fifty-sixty dollars.  It's yours. \nThe man quickly removes his coat and extends it... \nFATS (continuing) See, ya a smart guy, Gazzo's don't have to know nuthin'. I'll go tape up the hand like ya broke my thumb.  Gazzo won't be wise to nothin' -- Be a smart guy, keep the coat, we'll fake like ya broke the hand. \nThe man extends his coat again... Rocky suddenly grabs the man's thumb and bends him to his knees. \nFATS (almost a whisper) No - no - no - Please - Please - Please don't... \nRocky releases the man who remains almost in shock.  The thumb is fine. \nROCKY ...That's what coulda happened. (walks off.) \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nLater that morning Rocky passes \"Animal Town Pet Shop\" in South Philly... The shop is not very prosperous looking.  In the window hangs a sign reading \"Today's special -- Mixed Kittens -- $1.50\"... Rocky stops at this shop every morning. He stares at a litter of Lhasa Apsa puppies.  He taps the window and whistles.  He SEES a girl behind the counter and presses his face against the window and does his impression of the Hunchback of Notre Dame.  The girl nervously looks away. \nThe girl behind the counter is ADRIAN KLEIN.  She is not very attractive, but pleasant-looking.  Thirty years old. Brown hair pulled back.  Light skinned.  She wears glasses. \nRocky really stops by to flirt with Adrian, but she is so painfully shy nothing ever gets started... Rocky enters. \nINT. PET SHOP - DAY \nADRIAN ... Could you take the puppy out -- \nCUSTOMER It can breathe. \nADRIAN Please - \nCUSTOMER Please, nothin' - I paid for this dog and can do whatever I want with it - I can throw it through the window if I want - Now give me my two dollars back before I do throw it through the window. \nRocky walks over to her, stares hard in her face and snatches the bag out of her hand.  He removes the puppy and hands it to Adrian. \nCUSTOMER Get away from me - Give me that! \nRocky takes a couple dollars out of his pocket and hands it to the lady... She nervously exits. \nROCKY ... How's the turtle food this week? \nADRIAN ... Fine. \nROCKY Me, I'm kinda aggravated. \nGAZZO It don't matter.  It's my reputation.  These guys think they can get off light.  It's bad for my reputation -- It's bad for business.  See ya killer. \nGazzo gets into his car. \nGAZZO (to Bodyguard) ... The Rock's a good kid. \nBODYGUARD (emotionless) ... A meatbag. \nThey pull away. \nEXT. GYM - DAY \nGazzo drives off and Rocky strolls across the street to Goldmill's Gym.  On the way he passes several familiar people and exchanges waves... Out front is a young Irishman who runs a soft pretzel stand... His name is RUDY.  It is apparent from his face he was a prize fighter... He is blind and mentally defective. \nRUDY ...See the fight last night? \nRUDY Nah, I was fightin' myself. \nRUDY Apollo Creed beat the bum to pieces. \nEXT./INT. GYM - DAY \nMickey's Gym is surrounded by bars and a couple of greasy spoons.  Out front a crowd of young Blacks talk and jive among themselves.  Two winos lean against the entrance. \nRocky enters the gym... The place is nearly full.  The MEASURED BEAT of SKIP ROPES and THROBBING SPEED BAGS makes the room come alive, like it was a mindless piece of machinery.  Over the loudspeaker MUSIC by the Isley Brothers BLARES out... The music adds a background to the CLANG of the AUTOMATIC TIMERS, SNORTING SPARRING PARTNERS and the THUDDING of HEAVY BAGS. \nThe room is divided -- Fifty percent Black -- thirty-five percent Latin -- ten percent white -- five percent other. \nAs Rocky walks through the gym many of the FIGHTERS pause to wave and yell greetings. \nFIGHTER #1 Hey, hear ya knocked Spider Rice out in the sixth? \nROCKY The third -- Shoulda seen it. \nRocky passes another FIGHTER punching the heavy bag. \nFIGHTER #2 (removes glove) Hey, Rock, touch my hand. \nROCKY How come? \nFIGHTER #2 C'mon, it's important. \nRocky touches the Fighter's bare hand. \nFIGHTER #2 (continuing) Can ya tell I just whacked-off? \nRocky smiles and moves away. \nINT. DRESSING ROOM - DAY \nThe dressing room is lined with dented lockers.  Wooden benches stretch across the room.  On the wall is a sign that reads, \"NO KISSING.\" \nRocky goes to his locker.  He tries to open it but fails. He leans his ear against the lock and rolls the tumblers. Still it does not open.  He shakes the lock forcefully, no luck... Rocky is flustered and sits on a bench to ponder the situation. \nAfter a moment of deep thought, Rocky stands, seizes the bench and smashes open the lock.  Opening the door Rocky is taken aback when he sees a set of very flashy clothes. \nROCKY (mumbling) ... These ain't my clothes. \nHe sees a picture of several black girls taped on the inside of the door. \nROCKY (continuing) ... These ain't my pictures. \nA short powerful man of thirty-five enters.  His hair looks like it has been shaped with hedge clippers.  His name is MIKE. \nROCKY Yo, Mike -- What's happenin' here? \nMIKE It ain't your locker no more. \nROCKY Whatta ya talkin' about it ain't my locker no more? \nMIKE Listen, I'm with you -- But ya gotta talk to Mickey -- I put ya stuff in the bag over there. \nRocky looks at his belongings crammed in a wilted shopping bag and follows Mike across the room... Mike leans his head into the shower room.  Two Latin fighters are lathering up. \nFIGHTER ...Hey, Peanut, gimme some soap, Man. \nMIKE (irate) Hey, Nobody -- Yeah, you, Nobody -- You don't call me Peanut. \nFIGHTER Peanut, gimme some soap. \nROCKY You think everybody I fight is a bum. \nMICKEY Ain't they? \nMickey shoots Rocky a quick, indifferent look and removes a rosary from his pocket and idly rolls it around his fingers. \nMICKEY (continuing) Ya want the truth -- Ya got heart, but ya fight like an ape -- The only thing special about you is ya never got ya nose broke -- keep ya nose pretty -- what's left of ya brain an' retire. \nROCKY Listen, I'm gonna take a steam -- Did good last night -- Shoulda seen it. \nMICKEY Hey, ever think about retirin'? \nROCKY ...No. \nMICKEY Think about it. \nROCKY Yeah, sure. \nShrugging, Rocky moves away. \nROCKY (continuing) ...I think I'm gonna take a steam -- Shoulda seen me fight -- Did good, y'know. \nMickey leans over to Mike who approaches with a mop and pail. \nMICKEY (gesturing towards Rocky) Known him since he was fifteen -- A waste of life. \nDejected, Rocky travels to the locker room.  He passes Big Dipper sparring in a ring... Dipper spits a mouthful of water in a bucket and looks smugly at Rocky. \nDIPPER (to Rocky) ... I dig yo' locker, Man. \nTRAINER Time, Dipper. \nDipper smiles cruelly and begins sparring... Scene FADES on Rocky's crestfallen expression.  He moves off. \nEXT. PET SHOP - DUSK \nAt sunset Rocky comes down the street and pauses at the pet shop... He is eating Colonel Sanders' fried chicken out of a bag... He taps on the window with a chicken bone. \nINT. PET SHOP - DUSK \nInside Adrian is arranging pet toys on the counter... She hears the tapping, sees Rocky, and tenses.  Rocky enters. \nROCKY ... Wow -- cold!  Good night to catch pneumonia. \nAdrian smiles slightly and moves behind the counter.  Rocky fumbles idly among the pet toys. \nROCKY (continuing) Ah -- I came in here for somethin'... Oh, yeah, would ya like somebody to walk ya home? \nThe girl wants to say yes but a tremendous inferiority complex will not permit it... Rocky understands. \nROCKY (continuing) Hey, how's my buddy doin'? (looks into Butkus' cage) -- Nice dog -- Well, I'll see ya later. \nADRIAN ... Goodnight, Rocky. \nRocky exits.  Adrian watches his departure with mixed emotions. \nEXT. ANDY'S BAR - NIGHT \nA short while later Rocky arrives at Andy's Bar... He throws the Colonel Sanders bag and bones in a large public litter can.  The trash can has a bicentennial picture of George Washington pointing at a pile of garbage.  The caption reads, \"There was no litter at Valley Forge!\" \nINT. ANDY'S BAR - NIGHT \nRocky enters the bar.  He sits the Drunk in a booth... Several drinkers wave at him.  OLD ANDY sets a mug of beer in front of him... Rocky seems to be looking for someone. \nROCKY Catch pneumonia out there -- Seen Paulie? \nAndy casually nods towards the men's room. \nRocky traverses the room and passes TWO DRUNKS leaning on the bar. \nINT. ANDY'S RESTROOM - NIGHT \nRocky enters the restroom... It is a vile stench hole with years of the remnants of many sick drunks caked on the wall. \nPAULIE is presently trying to comb his hair in the only remaining piece of mirror in the room... Paulie is in his early thirties.  He is medium height.  Brown hair.  Square shouldered.  He has a foul personality... A classic misanthrope. \nROCKY Yo, Paulie. \nPAULIE (very drunk) Yo, Rocky -- Look at this mirror.  I'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror. \nMarie nods. \nROCKY (continuing) Listen, I hope ya don't -- \nMARIE I won't. \nROCKY What was I gonna say? \nMARIE Ya hope I don't keep acting like a whore or I'll turn into one, right? \nROCKY Ya, somethin' like that. \nThey exchange smiles and Marie moves away.  Rocky has made an impact on her life. \nMARIE Goodnight, Rocky. \nROCKY 'Night, Marie. \nShe takes a few more steps and pauses again. \nMARIE ... Fuck you, Creepo!!! \nThe girl runs to her house as Rocky looks on in dismay. \nROCKY (walks off) ... Yeah, who're you to give advice, Creepo. \nINT. JERGENS' OFFICE - DAY \nAPOLLO CREED and his LAWYER and TRAINER are seated in the offices of MILES JERGENS.  Jergens, a successful promoter looks unhappy as he looks into the scowling face of Apollo Creed. \nLAWYER Are the doctor's reports confirmed? \nJERGENS Definitely -- (reading) -- It says here, Mac Lee Green has suffered a seriously cracked third metacarpal in his left hand. \nAPOLLO Damn. \nJERGENS I suppose we could cancel the fight indefinitely if you are set on fighting Green. \nTRAINER It ain't just Green, what about the time Apollo's invested -- \nJERGENS I believe we can find a solution. \nAPOLLO Solution, nothin' -- What about the Bicentennial fight. \nLAWYER Jergens, don't play games with my client!  Apollo has already done nearly a million dollars worth of publicity -- \nTRAINER Ten million's worth! \nLAWYER -- And has made contractual obligations with over twenty different organizations -- He doesn't want to be embarrassed. \nAPOLLO You best find me another ranked contender an' I mean in a flash, man! \nJERGENS (holding up some notes) I contacted Ernie Roman's manager, he's fighting in France the same week. \nAPOLLO Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth. \nJERGENS Shaw's fighting in South America -- Why not postpone the bout until July Fourth? \nLAWYER Hell with Fourth of July, man! Ten thousand things'll be goin' down on the Fourth of July! -- Apollo wants to be first! \nJERGENS That may not be possible, Jimmy. \nTRAINER This man here is the Star, dig -- Don't cause him to breathe heavy -- Now what 'bout that sucker, Billy Dukes? \nJERGENS Went to California and gained fifty pounds -- and I called every worthwhile contender, but they say five weeks isn't enough time to get in shape. \nApollo stands beneath a new fight poster and points to it. \nAPOLLO Shape, nothin' -- They're afraid.  They know everybody in the world's gonna see this fight an' none of them gotta prayer of beating me so they're makin' excuses so they don't have to be the chump that's gonna be whipped in front of the whole civilized world!! \nJERGENS Apollo, I'm sure there's a way to salvage this. \nTRAINER Nobody wants to be dissected on the country's birthday. \nJERGENS All I can counter with is that I'm a goddamn good promoter -- I've promoted in every country in the world -- and I've tried to the best of my abilities. Perhaps you're right, and no one wants to be beat on the country's birthday... I don't know what else to say -- \nAPOLLO I do -- Maybe what this fight needs is something new -- a novelty. \nTRAINER You's the novelty, Champ! \nJERGENS Joe Zack is a good prospect -- Exciting boy. \nAPOLLO ... Still don't feel no heat. \nJERGENS (sighs) Exactly what are you looking for, Apollo? \nAPOLLO ... This man. \nEverybody leans forward. \nAPOLLO (continuing; much amused) 'The Italian Stallion' -- He's my man. \nJERGENS Rocky Balboa -- His record's poor -- \nAPOLLO Don't matter -- That name. 'The Italian Stallion,' it's right on. (laughs) Who discovered America?  An Italian, right?  So, man, what could be better than to get it on with one of his ancestors -- \nTRAINER He won't last one round. \nAPOLLO Listen, I gonna carry this boy three rounds, then drop 'im like a bad habit. \nTRAINER I don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong. \nAPOLLO Southpaw, nuthin' -- I'll drop 'im in three -- 'Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion.' Shhiii -- Sounds like a damn monster movie!! \nEveryone laughs. \nFADE OUT. \nFADE IN: \nEXT. STREET - DUSK \nRocky and Paulie walk towards his house... Even though it is cold and dark, a group of kids conduct an energetic game of half-ball. (Half-ball is a variation of stick-ball.) \nROCKY (mimes throwing) I usta be deadly at half-ball. \nPAULIE I hate the friggin' game... I'd like to talk some business. \nROCKY What kinda business? \nPAULIE Look at my hands -- See how the joints are swollen. \nPaulie extends his thick hands and tries to make a fist. \nPAULIE (continuing) Inflamed joints -- Walkin' in an' out of a freezer carryin' meat plays hell on the joints. \nROCKY Maybe ya should see a doctor. \nPAULIE I don't need a doctor, I need a different job. \nROCKY Maybe another job is the best thing. \nPAULIE Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a friend an' would do a good job... Tell him I ain't bothered by nothin' an' would be a great collector... Bustin' bones don't bother me -- Tell him I'm a good worker. \nROCKY Gazzo's gotta come to you. \nPAULIE I'm askin' ya to go to him -- As a favor. \nROCKY Gazzo's gotta come to you -- Hey, Paulie, it's a bad job -- Do what you do now. \nEXT. ATOMIC HOAGIE SHOP - DUSK \nThey continue past the Atomic Hoagie Shoppe, Inc... A group of young men pitch quarters on the sidewalk out front. \nRocky pauses... He sees Marie, the little girl from the night before, hanging around with the guys.  She sees Rocky. \nMarie takes a deep drag on her cigarette and faces the opposite direction... The gang smiles and continues to pitch quarters. \nAnger and disappointment register across Rocky's face. \nPAULIE You know her? \nRocky shrugs and the two men move off... Filling the night air is the METALLIC SOUND of pitching QUARTERS. \nEXT. PAULIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThe men arrive at Paulie's home.  It is at the top of a dimly-lit four story walk-up. \nROCKY Ya sister knows I'm comin'? \nADRIAN It's Thanksgiving. \nROCKY To you, to me it's Thursday. \nINT. ICE SKATING RINK - NIGHT \nRocky and Adrian enter a deserted skating rink. \nROCKY Looks quiet, y'know. \nADRIAN I think it's closed. \nROCKY I think mebbe we're early or somethin' -- \nFrom across the rink a CLEANING MAN yells at them. \nCLEANER Hey, whatta ya doin' here -- we're closed... Yo, we're closed! \nROCKY (yells back) Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody. \nCLEANER (starts to walk over) Hey, the rink is empty 'cause we're closed -- ya ain't allowed in here so do me a favor an' not stay here. \nROCKY Wait here, gotta smooth this guy out. \nADRIAN (softly) We could go somewhere else an' -- \nRocky approaches the Cleaner. \nCLEANER Yo, pal, what's with you -- The place ain't operatin'. \nROCKY Listen, I gotta problem.  This girl ain't feelin' well, y'know -- The doctor says she should exercise, y'know once in awhile an' ice skatin' is the best thing -- \nCLEANER This a con? \nROCKY Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise -- \nCLEANER Few minutes? \nROCKY ... Ten minutes. \nCLEANER Ten minutes for ten dollars. \nROCKY ... Yeah, give 'er the Blades. \nINT. ICE SKATING RINK - NIGHT \nAdrian has on skates.  Rocky follows her onto the ice.  He wears street shoes. \nADRIAN ... Aren't you skating? \nROCKY Ain't skated since I was fifteen -- That's when I started fightin' -- gotta watch the ankles.  Yeah, fightin' use to be tops with me, but no more.  All I wanted to prove was I weren't no bum -- That I had the stuff to make a good pro. \nADRIAN And you never got the chance? \nThe Cleaner yells from the sideline. \nCLEANER Nine minutes! \nROCKY Hey, I ain't cryin'... I still fight.  Kinda do it like a hobby.  See I'm a natural southpaw an' most pugs won't fight a southpaw 'cause we mess up their timin' an' look awkward -- Southpaw means lefthanded... But I guess in the long run things probably worked out for the best, right? \nADRIAN But you never had a chance to prove yourself. \nROCKY Absolutely. \nCLEANER Eight minutes! \nAdrian slips and Rocky breaks her fall. \nROCKY I just dislocated my finger. \nADRIAN Ohh! \nCLEANER Seven minutes! \nROCKY It ain't your fault -- I originally done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight. (opens his wallet) That's me fightin' Big Baby Crenshaw -- Big Baby was the size of an airplane an' I broke my hands on his head -- I lost, but it's a nice picture, don't ya think? \nCLEANER Six! \nROCKY How 'bout some Cokes? \nINT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nRocky and Adrian enter his one-room apartment... She is nervous and taken aback by the bleakness of the room... Rocky goes to the icebox. \nROCKY Would ya like a glass of water? \nADRIAN ... No thanks. \nAdrian looks at the mirror above Rocky's dresser.  She sees a high school photo of Rocky.  He once was handsome and smooth-faced... Rocky steps up behind her and his face is reflected in the mirror. \nHe turns on his cheap RECORD PLAYER... He reaches into the turtle bowl. \nROCKY Here's the guys I was tellin' ya about -- This is Cuff an' Link. \nADRIAN I sold them to you. \nROCKY (very embarrassed) ... Oh, yeah, I bought the whole kit -- Yeah, ya sold me the turtles, the bowl, an' the mountain -- I had to get rid of the mountain 'cause they kept fallin' off. \nADRIAN Do you have a phone? \nROCKY I had it pulled.  People callin' all the time.  Who needs it -- Who'd you wanna call? \nADRIAN I wanna let my brother know where I am. \nROCKY D'you really wanna call? \nADRIAN Yes, I do. \nROCKY You sure? \nADRIAN Yes. \nROCKY Why? \nADRIAN I think he might be worried. \nROCKY I'll call your brother. \nRocky flings open the window and bellows like a foghorn. \nROCKY (continuing) !!Yo, Paulie -- Ya sister's with me!  I'll call ya later. \nRocky closes the window and faces the woman... She is not smiling.  She looks frightened. \nROCKY (continuing) What's the matter?  Ya don't like the room? \nADRIAN It's fine. \nROCKY It's only temporary. \nADRIAN It's not that -- \nROCKY What's the problem?  You don't like me -- Don't like the turtles -- What is it? \nADRIAN I don't think I belong here. \nROCKY It's okay. \nADRIAN No, I don't belong here. \nROCKY It's all right -- You're my guest. \nADRIAN ... I've never been in a man's apartment before. \nROCKY (gesturing) They're all the same. \nADRIAN I'm not sure I know you well enough -- I don't think I'm comfortable. \nROCKY Yo, I'm not comfortable either. \nADRIAN (standing) I should leave. \nROCKY But I'm willin' to make the best of this uncomfortable situation. \nAdrian moves to the door... Rocky intercepts her. \nROCKY (continuing; softly) Would ya take off your glasses? \nADRIAN (dumbstruck) What? \nSECRETARY May I help you? \nRocky hands her the business card. \nSECRETARY (continuing) Your name, please? \nROCKY Balboa, Rocky Balboa. \nThe Secretary rises and enters Jergens' office... Rocky eyes the multitude of sporting pictures hanging on all four walls. \nThe Secretary returns. \nSECRETARY You may go in. \nRocky collects himself and enters... \nINT. JERGENS' OFFICE - DAY \nMiles Jergens warmly greets him. \nJERGENS Hello, Mr. Balboa -- I'm Miles Jergens -- Please, have a seat. \nROCKY ... Thanks. \nJERGENS Mr. Balboa -- \nROCKY (overriding) Rocky. \nJERGENS Rocky, do you have any representation?  A manager? \nROCKY No -- Just me. \nJERGENS Rocky, would you be interested in -- \nROCKY Sparrin'? \nJERGENS Excuse me. \nROCKY I know ya need sparrin' partners -- I'm very available. \nJERGENS I'm sure you are. \nROCKY Absolutely -- Sparrin' with the Champ would be an honor -- y'know what? \nJERGENS What? \nROCKY I wouldn't take no cheap shots. I'd be a good sparrin' partner. \nJergens seems very amused.  He lights a cigar. \nJERGENS Rocky, would you be interested in fighting Apollo Creed for the Championship? \nROCKY ... Like I said, I'd make a boss sparrin' mate. \nJERGENS Did you hear what I said? \nROCKY Sure, an' I'm smart enough to know that no sparrin' partner should take cheap shots at the Champ.  He's just there to help condition the man. \nJERGENS Not spar, I'm asking whether you would be interested in fighting Creed for the championship. \nThe weight of the statement comes crashing down in Rocky. For a long moment he becomes nothing more than a basket case as he ponders the statement... He half regains his senses. \nROCKY ... Ah... Absolutely. \nThe SCENE FADES and becomes a black and white television. \nINT. PAULIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nRocky and Adrian are at her home watching an old black and white television... Rocky smiles... The film now cuts to Apollo being interviewed. \nREPORTER #1 How'd you like the 'City of Brotherly Love?' \nAPOLLO I like my Philadelphia Brothers. An' I'm patriotic! \nApollo has to move to the side to avoid a thrusting microphone. \nAPOLLO (continuing; mock seriousness) If yo' don't back up I'm gonna send yo' home with a microphone in yo' nose! \nThe Reporters laugh. \nROCKY Hey, who cared about me yesterday, huh?  Nobody -- I think I'm gonna train myself. \nPAULIE Without havin' good people around, ya won't have such a good chance. \nAdrian is not happy with her brother's overbearing attitude. She faces him. \nADRIAN Einstein flunked out of school... twice. \nPAULIE That so. \nADRIAN Roosevelt finished last in his class -- Beethoven was deaf, an' Helen Keller was blind -- I think Rocky has a good chance. \nINT. HALLWAY OF PAULIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nRocky stands in Adrian's doorway.  He kisses her. \nROCKY See ya tomorrow. \nRocky moves down the stairway and continues to do so as he converses with Adrian who remains upstairs.  His VOICE ECHOES up the stairwell. \nROCKY (continuing) How'd ya like hearin' ya name on TV? \nADRIAN I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that? \nROCKY Ya puttin' me on, right? \nADRIAN (smiles) Absolutely -- What time should I expect you? \nROCKY 'Bout seven. \nADRIAN I'll be waiting. \nRocky is now on the ground floor yelling up to Adrian on the top floor landing. \nROCKY Y'know how I said that stuff on television didn't bother me? \nADRIAN Yes. \nROCKY It did. \nAs Rocky completes the last word, he exits the building and slams the door which RESOUNDS throughout the apartment house. \nEXT. ATOMIC HOAGIE SHOP - NIGHT \nGazzo, the bodyguard, and Rocky are standing out front. They are eating hot sandwiches. \nROCKY Y'know I won't be able to work for ya no more. \nGAZZO Hey -- if a good man can make a better life, let him make it. \nROCKY I feel bad about walkin'. \nGAZZO Take your shot, kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses? \nROCKY A few bucks. \nGazzo takes out a wad and peels off several bills. \nGAZZO Here's five hundred -- Put it in your glove. \nROCKY Do I have to pay juice? \nGazzo looks at the Bodyguard and shakes his head as if to imply, \"Why's this guy asking such a foolish question?\" \nGazzo and the bodyguard step to the white Caddy parked at the curb.  They enter the cab.  Rocky watches. \nINT. CAR - NIGHT \nGAZZO (smiles) Does Santa Claus charge juice? Merry Christmas -- Now, how's about my present, ya gonna win? \nROCKY Gonna try. \nGAZZO Listen, kid, I'm with ya.  Ya know, I'm with ya -- Italian, we're blood.  You kill this rug -- We Guinneas gotta show these Afro-Americans where it's at.  Give it your best shot cause I want ya to prove to these bums on the corner that my man can't be beat by this rug... Ya got any action on the side. \nROCKY No action. \nGAZZO Ya gettin 150 grand killer. Ya got any plans for it? Whatta ya think? (MORE) \nGAZZO (CONT'D) Ya like to put it on the street, make it work for ya? \nROCKY (uneasy) ... What? \nMICKEY (driving each word hard) I done it all.  I've done an' seen everything'.  Believe what I'm tellin' ya -- Ya shoulda seen the night in Brooklyn, I smacked 'Ginny' Russo outta the ring, September 14, 1923 -- same night Firpo knocked Dempsey outta the ring. But who got the Press?  He did. He had a manager -- September \nROCKY (softly) Ya got a good mind for dates. \nMickey deafly continues, becoming more engrossed every second. \nMICKEY Look at this face -- twenty- one stitches over the left eye, thirty-four over the right -- my nose was busted seventeen times, the last being the Sailor Mike fight New Year's Eve, 1940, in Camden, New Jersey -- What a professional pastin' I give him.  Here, read about it. (MORE) \nMICKEY (CONT'D) (shows a tiny press clipping; points to cauliflower ear) An' he give me the vegetable on the ear.  I got pain an' experience... an' you got heart -- kinda remind me of Marciano, ya do. \nRocky points to his most prized possession. \nROCKY Nobody ever said that -- There's his picture. \nMICKEY Yeah, ya kinda remind me of the Rock.  Ya move like 'im. \nMickey has rung the bell.  Nothing could please Rocky more than being compared to his idol. \nROCKY Really think so? \nMICKEY Ya got heart. \nROCKY Heart, but I ain't got no Tocker. \nRocky shifts against the wall and lowers himself into a crouch. \nMICKEY Christ, I know this business. Rocky, when I was fightin' it was the dirtiest racket goin', see.  Pugs like me was treated like fightin' dogs -- throw ya in the pit an' for ten bucks ya try to kill each other.  We had no management... (MORE) \nMICKEY (CONT'D) fought in boxcars, in whorehouse basements, any joint with a floor -- October 1931 I fought a bum who put a tack in the thumb of his glove an' punched so many holes in my face I had spit shootin' outta my cheeks -- I never had no manager watchin' out for me -- See that picture outside the gym -- 'Mighty Mick,' that's me in my prime.  I had all the tools.  I coulda starched any lightweight husky on the East Coast -- But I had no management.  Nobody ever got to know how slick I was, but I had a head for business an' stashed a few bucks an' opened the gym -- It's a dirt hole, I know it, but that an' a lotta scars is what I got to show for fifty years in the business, kid -- now you come along with this shot an' I feel like it's me gettin' the shot I never got... Yeah, we was treated like dogs -- like them Dago's, no offense, in the Colosseum in Rome there -- An' now I got all this knowledge, I wanna give it to ya so I can protect ya an' make sure ya get the best deal ya can! \nRocky rises and opens a window. \nMICKEY (continuing) Respect, I always dished ya respect. \nROCKY ... Ya gave Dipper my locker. \nMICKEY (almost begging) I'm sorry, I -- I made a mistake.  Kid, I'm askin' man to man.  I wanna be ya manager. \nROCKY The fight's set -- I don't need a manager. \nMICKEY Look, you can't buy what I know.  Ya can't.  I've seen it all!  I got pain an' I got experience. \nROCKY I got pain an' experience too. \nMICKEY Please, kid. \nROCKY (tightly) Whatever I got, I always got on the slide.  This shot's no different.  I didn't earn nothin' -- I got it on the slide... I needed ya help about ten years ago when I was startin', but ya never helped me none. \nMickey drops the ashtray and kneels to pick it up... He remains on one knee. \nMICKEY If ya was wantin' my help, why didn't ya ask?  Just ask. \nROCKY I asked, but ya never helped nothin'! -- Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance. \nMICKEY (yells) Rocky, I'm seventy-six years old.  Maybe you can be the winner I never was -- your shot is my last shot! \nRocky is choked and goes into the bathroom and closes the door. \nMickey struggles to his feet and, like a beaten man, leaves. \nSeveral moments later Rocky steps out and lowers himself into bed.  Springing up a second later, he runs outside. \nEXT. STREET OF ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nRocky races up the block toward the shadowy and hunched form of Mickey.  Way in the distance, we SEE Rocky stop the old man beneath a street lamp.  He places an arm around his shoulder. \nINT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - PRE-DAWN \nThe following morning, Rocky's ALARM CLOCK GOES OFF at exactly four A.M.  Not accustomed to rising this early, with great difficulty Rocky staggers to his feet and wavers to the bathroom.  He turns the light on and roaches scatter. \nAt the top of the mirror hang the telegrams.  Rocky fills the basin and submerges his face in cold water. \nRocky sways to the icebox and removes a dozen eggs.  He cracks five raw eggs into a glass and downs it in one swill... his body quivers. \nEXT. STREET OF ROCKY'S APARTMENT - PRE-DAWN \nRocky steps outside.  He is dressed in a well-worn sweat suit with a hood, gloves and sneakers.  It is pitch dark and his steaming breath attests to the cold. \nROCKY Sure I like her. \nPAULIE (nervous laughter) What's the attraction?  I don't see it? \nROCKY I dunno -- she fills gaps. \nPAULIE What gaps? \nROCKY (shrugs and takes meat) She got gaps.  I got gaps -- together we fill the gaps. \nPAULIE (sharply) You ballin' her? \nROCKY (turns around) Don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister. \nPAULIE (tersely) C'mon, ya screwin' her? \nFrom across the room Rocky looks him hard in the eyes. \nROCKY That's why I can't put ya together with Gazzo, cause ya talk too much -- big mouth. \nPaulie reddens.  He steps forward and slams his fists in a hanging beef. \nThe punching of the beef is a muted challenge and Rocky responds. \nRocky walks up to a beef and slams his fist into the ribs. \nThe grotesque object swings in a wide arc like a hanging corpse.  Rocky moves to the next one and hooks. \nRocky's face reveals a never before seen concentration, as though he were locked in total battle. \nPAULIE Hit the rump.  The rump! Ya'll break the ribs! \nRocky speeds up and continues pounding on the second row of beef.  Paulie's eyes widen and his face grimaces with every punch, like he were receiving it.  Rocky moves into the dark recess of the refrigerator.  Only the dull SOUNDS of his POUNDING FISTS can be HEARD. \nRocky works his way to Paulie again.  Every hanging beef swings and appears surrealistically alive. \nPAULIE (continuing) We do that to Creed an' they'll take us to jail for murder. \nRocky looks at his hands.  They are drenched in red up to the elbows with beef blood. \nPaulie hands him a package of beef. \nROCKY Don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister. \nRocky takes the package and runs out.  Paulie's bleary eyes reveal a fearful respect and slight resentment. \nINT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - DAY \nThe gym is filled to capacity.  The NOISE is DEAFENING. Rocky pounds a heavy bag. \nMickey steps forward and removes a piece of string from his pocket. \nMICKEY (passionate) Stop!  Stop!  I can't stand it! It's clumsy.  You're off balance. \nHe motions to his bullish helper, Mike.  He hands him the string. \nMICKEY (continuing) Tie it to both ankles -- Leave two feet slack. \nROCKY I never had good footwork. \nMike completes the task. \nMICKEY Forget the footwork -- You're off balance.  The legs are sticking everywhere.  Marciano had the same problem, an' the string cured it.  When you can hit and move without breakin' the string you'll have balance. \nMIKE You'll be a very dangerous person. \nTwo young boys in street clothes interrupt Mickey. \nBOY Rocky, could we have your autograph? \nROCKY ... Sure. \nMICKEY (irate) Don't you boys ever interrupt when I'm conductin' business, or I'll kill you both -- Go away. \nThe boys depart. \nMICKEY (continuing) Autographs!  Ya wanna be a writer or a fighter?  Let's work. \nMike looks off across the gym. \nMICKEY What's happenin' here? \nDIPPER I'm happenin'!  This pig is takin' my shot -- I iz a contender.  He's nothin'. \nROCKY (dumbstruck) Yo', Dipper, why're ya -- \nDIPPER (shaking his fist) Spar me in front of these here TV dudes -- I knock ya ass to Jersey! \nDipper's fat black trainer holds out his hands and Dipper slaps them soul style. \nMICKEY (to Dipper) You can forget about sparring, kid. \nDIPPER Yo' know I iz the best man here!  Yo' said so yoself! \nMICKEY (almost apologetically to the crew) Why let Rocky here take a chance on cuttin' or breakin' a hand? -- Take a shower, Dipper. \nDIPPER Don't mouth me, old man, I'll knock yo' out too.  C'mon, wop, spar me, let everybody see who's got the heat around here. \nSilence looms over the gym... Apollo is apprehensive.  The scene is becoming too real.  The frightened television crew slyly begins putting away their expensive equipment. \nDIPPER (continuing; insanely) Man, yo' best keep them cameras out!  Fight me, boy! Let Creed here see the kind of punk he's fightin'! \nMike forces his way through the crowd and stands behind Rocky. \nMIKE Don't chance it, man -- He's sick. \nMICKEY This is gettin' outta hand -- Rocky will fight in the ring January first, not here! \nDIPPER Yo' yellow, old man. \nMICKEY Not yellow, cautious. (to the crew) See, it's very easy for a fighter to accidentally hurt -- \nDipper suddenly steps forward and slaps Rocky very hard across the side of the head... The gym becomes stone cold. Dipper is in total command and enjoying every moment of it. \nDIPPER If yo're afraid to fight me, then get down an' kiss my feet, boy. \nMickey looks nervously around and knows it's only seconds before the blood will run... Rocky stands motionless. \nMICKEY (softly) Let's take a walk, Rock. Please, don't take a chance. He wants to hurt you so you can't fight. \nRocky swallows his pride.  He still has the string around his ankles.  He starts to shuffle away with Mickey... Dipper steps forward and viciously slaps Rocky again. \nMike jumps forward. \nMIKE Why you tryin' to cut 'im, man! Back off, scumbag, or I'll bite your face! \nDipper cuts loose with a hook and knocks Mike flat.  The room reeks of fear... Apollo's eyes flick back and forth between Rocky and Dipper.  Apollo taps his bodyguards and they begin to ease away. \nDIPPER ... Now, boy, kiss my feet. \nRocky eyes his friend lying on the floor.  He shuffles forward and stands before Dipper. \nDIPPER (continuing; almost in a whisper) ... Kiss 'em. \nRocky looks at Mickey, then lowers his eyes to Dipper's feet... Dipper smiles.  Rocky starts to bend towards the shoes.  Without warning, he explodes with a pair of combinations into Dipper's exposed ribs.  A CRACK is HEARD and Dipper sinks to the floor writhing in pain... The room is silent except for Dipper's moaning. \nApollo is stunned by the scene.  The gym has become a very gloomy place.  He eyes Rocky with admiration and a hint of apprehension... He leaves. \nMickey is the first one to shake off the chill... He shakes his fists at the Reporters, and puts his arm around Rocky. \nMICKEY The kid's got cannons -- Print that. \nThe crowd disperses, leaving Dipper a pathetic and broken figure lying on a dirty gym floor. \nINT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThey enter the dismal apartment... On the floor are at least ten telegrams.  Rocky scoops them up and tosses them aside. Next to the door is a pile of over a hundred telegrams. ADRIAN Don't you open them anymore? \nROCKY They either say, 'Kill the nigger' or 'Hope you die, Honky.' -- What ya got in the bag? \nAdrian steps to the window.  She pulls a pair of short but lovely curtains from a shopping bag... The colorful curtains glare in the dark room. \nADRIAN Like? \nROCKY Sharp -- Real nice. \nADRIAN Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine? \nROCKY No... Sharp -- You look great. \nMeanwhile, the trainer sits across the room in a darkened corner looking at a small television.  He is watching Rocky's bloody exhibition on the news... \nHe waves at Apollo. \nTRAINER (worried) Apollo, you oughta come see this boy you're gonna fight on TV -- looks like he means business. \nApollo is still engrossed in his paperwork. \nAPOLLO I mean business, too -- (to men) The gross rental of the arena is gonna include the four hundred ushers, right? -- Gimme some coffee. \nEXT. PAULIE'S STREET - NIGHT \nIt is a moonless night and Paulie staggers across the street and enters his building... He staggers up the stairs. \nINT. PAULIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nPaulie removes his coat and tosses it listlessly in a chair... He rubs his red eyes and sways into the kitchen. \nHe takes a bottle of wine out of the icebox.  As he swills the wine he hears the SOUND of Rocky's and Adrian's VOICES traveling from his sister's room.  Paulie's face tightens and he staggers towards the bedroom. \nHe stands outside the bedroom door and peers through a crack... Rocky, Adrian, and the dog are watching TV in the otherwise darkened room. \nADRIAN ... And he called the reporters -- \nROCKY Yeah... Threw my whole day off. \nADRIAN Don't be mad at him -- He just wants to help. \nROCKY Yo -- I ain't mad.  I'm just outta joint when reporters are around -- They take cheap shots an' Paulie knows it. \nADRIAN ... Are you going to say anything to him? \nROCKY ... What's to say?  I dunno what he wants from me -- \nFilled with uncontrollable anger, Paulie smashes into the room. \nPAULIE Nothin'!  I want nothin' from you!!! \nADRIAN Paulie! \nPAULIE Shutup!  I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case!  Get outta my house! \nADRIAN It's not your house -- \nPAULIE You ain't no friend no more -- Go home!  Outta my house I want ya! \nADRIAN Don't talk like that to him! \nPAULIE Get outta my life both of ya's. \nPaulie kicks the door out of frustration and appears to be bordering on a nervous breakdown. \nPAULIE (continuing) Outta my house I want ya!! \nROCKY ... It's cold outside, Paulie. \nPaulie goes to the living room closet and removes a baseball bat... Rocky and Adrian quickly follow. \nPAULIE I don't want ya messin' up my sister no more -- He's scum from the corner, I don't raise ya to hang with no bum! \nAdrian is speechless... Rocky moves towards Paulie. \nPAULIE (continuing; raising the bat) ... Wanna hit on me?  C'mon -- C'mon, I'll break both ya arms so's they never work... \nRocky freezes... \nADRIAN ... Paulie.  Stop now! \nPAULIE I want 'im outta here -- (to Rocky) Don't think I'm good enough to work for Gazzo? (spits) That's what I think of bums like you an' Gazzo! (spits again) You're goin' up an' don't care enough to throw Paulie some crumbs! (spits) I give ya meat, an' I give ya my sister, too! \nADRIAN Only a pig would say that! \nPaulie smashes a small table with the bat. \nPAULIE (to Adrian) You forget what I went through to give ya the best. \nADRIAN You gave me what?!  Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything! \nPAULIE I always seen ya had the best, but did ya ever think of puttin' in a good word for me with this scumbag! \nMike has on a pair of target gloves and Rocky moves around the ring swinging at them. \nINT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - STILL LATER \nDrenched in sweat, Rocky hums the speed bag.  His expression is hard and flushed.  Mickey clicks a stopwatch and pats Rocky's shoulder... He is very happy. \nINT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - STILL LATER \nRocky has just completed exercising with the medicine ball... Dino hands him a towel... Paulie crosses the gym as Rocky heads to the steam room... A thin man crosses the gym and Mickey nods. \nMICKEY What cha say, Benny -- Meet 'The Rock.' This is our cutman, Benny Stein. \nROCKY Yo, Benny. \nMICKEY Check the eyes, Ben. \nBenny checks the skin around Rocky's eyes. \nBENNY Ain't bad.  Seen worse -- Cover up an' things should be okay. \nMICKEY Take a shower. \nHeading towards the shower, Rocky is intercepted by Paulie who traverses the gym.  He stops Rocky at the shower room entrance. \nPAULIE Yo, Rock, I think I found an angle to make some bread usin' ya name, ya mind? \nExhausted, Rocky studies Paulie's face a moment and nods 'yes.'... Rocky sways into the shower room and Paulie strides off. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nRunning... Rocky's crowd of trailing boys has tripled. Dashing through the streets, he resembles the Pied Piper. \nEXT. ART MUSEUM STAIRS - DAY \nIt is twilight and Rocky is alone at the very bottom of a huge flight of steps that seem to stretch into the heavens... Rocky takes a deep breath and sprints up the never-ending stairs... Halfway up, his body shows the strain.  Nearing the top, Rocky pumps with all his strength and arrives at the very top... He looks down the steep stairs and swells with pride... He is ready. \nINT. MAYOR'S OFFICE - DAY \nRocky is led into Mayor Rizzo's office by an aide... Rocky is very nervous as he approaches the mayor, who is seated behind his wide desk. \nMAYOR Sit down, Rocky. \nFlips open a thick file that lays in front of him. \nMAYOR (continuing) I've been going over your record -- You've been the busy type -- (reading) Nineteen arrests -- probation three times -- expelled from seven public schools in 1964 and '65. \nRocky tries to sink into the chair. \nMAYOR (continuing) I'm a very busy man, but I just wanted to remind you that you'll be setting an example for thousands of guys like yourself and maybe start them off in a new direction and give our police force a break -- I also hope you try your very best and bring pride to Philadelphia. \nROCKY ... I'll try. \nThe mayor presses a button and a photographer enters. \nMAYOR Would you stand up, please. \nRocky rises and the mayor shakes his hand... Their picture is taken three times... The photographer exits. \nMAYOR (continuing) Thank you for coming by, Rocky -- good luck. \nROCKY (turns) Any time. \nMAYOR (sitting) Wait... After the fight you'll have nearly a hundred and fifty thousand dollars -- What do you plan to do with it? \nROCKY (smiles) ... Run for mayor. \nThe mayor is shocked at first but then breaks into a big, friendly laugh, and Rocky exits. \nINT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nAdrian and Rocky are at his apartment.  They are looking at new scrapbooks.  Newsweek Magazine: Headline: \"The Italian Stallion or Donkey?\" -- Philadelphia Magazine -- Rocky stands with the mayor. \nADRIAN Rocky, do you realize everybody in this country knows your face, and after the fight everybody in the world is going to. \nROCKY Yeah... \nShe flips through Sports Illustrated, The American Sportsman, Ring Magazine, World Boxing, True, and a multitude of other clippings. \nThe TELEPHONE RINGS... Rocky rises and walks to the new white object hanging on the wall. \nROCKY ... I can't beat him. \nADRIAN Apollo? \nROCKY Yeah, I can't beat him. \nAdrian touches his face. \nROCKY I been watchin' the movies -- studyin' -- He ain't weak nowhere. \nADRIAN What're we going to do? \nROCKY ... I dunno. \nADRIAN Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard. \nROCKY It ain't so bad, 'cause I was a nothin' before -- \nADRIAN Don't say that. \nROCKY C'mon, it's true -- But that don't bother me -- I just wanna prove somethin' -- I ain't no bum... It don't matter if I lose... Don't matter if he opens my head... The only thing I wanna do is go the distance -- That's all. Nobody's ever gone fifteen rounds with Creed.  If I go them fifteen rounds, an' that bell rings an' I'm still standin', I'm gonna know then I weren't just another bum from the neighborhood... \nAdrian touches Rocky's face... The fighter gently lowers himself beside his woman. \nROCKY (continuing) ... No foolin' around. \nINT. ARENA - NIGHT \nIt is the night of the Bicentennial fight... The location is the Philadelphia Spectrum. \nThe Spectrum is filling to capacity... Grandly dressed celebrities and wealthy fight fans lower themselves into their ringside seat.  Nearly everyone is holding a red, white, and blue sweater... \nThe arena is decorated in tons of patriotic red, white and blue.  High above the ring are huge posters of GEORGE WASHINGTON - ABE LINCOLN - DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. - BEN FRANKLIN - and APOLLO CREED. \nINT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT \nApollo Creed sits in his dressing room... It is dead silent except for some NOISE that filters under the door from the arena. \nIt is a CLOSE-UP of Apollo's hand being taped... The RASPING SOUND of the adhesive tape is very pronounced. \nINT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT \nThe atmosphere is identical to Apollo's dressing room. Adrian watches in silence as Mike wraps Rocky's hand. \nAgain, the most pronounced SOUND is the RASPING of the adhesive tape. \nINT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT \nApollo's other hand is being wrapped.  Dead silence except for the TAPE and APOLLO'S BREATHING. \nINT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT \nRocky's other hand is being wrapped in a CLOSE-UP.  The only SOUND is the TAPE and ROCKY'S mounting BREATHING PATTERN. \nINT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT \nCLOSE-UP of drops being placed in his nose to help increase his intake of oxygen.  The tremendously magnified SOUND of APOLLO TAKING IN AIR. \nINT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT \nCLOSE-UP of the drops being placed in Rocky's nose. \nINT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT \nA heavy coating of vaseline is applied around the Champion's eyes... In an EXTREME CLOSE-UP, the eyes shine brightly with the grease. \nINT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT \nGrease is smeared around Rocky's eyes... In the EXTREME CLOSE-UP several deep scars are SEEN. \nINT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT \nCLOSE-UP of Apollo's trainer digging his fingers deeply into the thick neck muscles of Apollo's upper back and neck. \nINT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT \nCLOSE-UP OF Mike's arms wrapped around Rocky's waist and lifting his diaphragm up... Magnified BREATHING ROARS from the screen. \nINT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT \nTRAINER Don't kill yourself, man -- Let the doctor stop the fight. \nAPOLLO ... Stop jivin'! \nTRAINER Cover the ribs -- Look here, elbow down, tight -- Tight -- stand straight -- you're the best, you're the best! \nAPOLLO ... Thanks. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nRocky no longer resembles himself... His face has completely been beaten to jelly, but his mood is buoyant. \nROCKY How I look out there, Mick? \nMICKEY (truly worried) Great, kid, great. \nThe ring Doctor leans over Rocky and checks the eyes. \nDOCTOR One more round -- How do you feel? \nRocky is approaching the supreme moment of his life.  He cannot be bothered with pain or doctors. \nROCKY Fine -- Go away, I'm gonna make it -- I'm gonna make it! \nEveryone is distraught over Rocky's dangerous condition. \nMICKEY We gotta stop it, kid. \nMIKE Ya gave it ya best shot! \nMICKEY Nobody's gonna say ya didn't give ya all.  I can't let ya go out. \nRocky stands and eyes them all. \nROCKY (impassioned and quietly) I'll kill ya all... Don't stop nothin' -- \nANOTHER ANGLE \nThe BELL RINGS... Apollo moves cautiously out of his corner and circles to Rocky's right. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nThe Commentators stare unansweringly at the fighters. \nCOMMENTATOR #1 The fight has slowed down to a near stand-still -- Creed circles to Rocky's right... The spectrum is nearly silent -- Neither fighter has made a motion to throw... I've never seen anything like it in the last round of a championship fight... Apollo spits blood on the canvas.  It appears he is protecting his right side.  His ribs were probably injured at the end of round fourteen. (MORE) \nCOMMENTATOR #1 (CONT'D) It's confirmed, unofficially, Creed's ribs may be broken -- Apollo fakes a left and throws a big tired right -- Balboa's mouthpiece is out!  Creed attacks with one hand! \nANOTHER ANGLE \nApollo feints and Rocky falls for it.  The Champion unleashes a lethal blow to the side of the head that jolts Rocky's mouthpiece into the second row... Rocky sags against the ropes in a crucified position... The insane crowd leaps to their feet. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nRocky's bloody teeth snarl at Apollo and he waves him to come ahead and fight toe to toe... Apollo obliges with a weary but effective burst of rights and lefts that have K.O. written on every punch.  Rocky counters the assault blow for blow. \nROCKY Gimme ya best!!!! \nMickey looks at the clock... TEN SECONDS TO GO. \nROCKY (continuing) Gimme ya best!!! \nBlood sprays over the ropes and onto the ringside photographers... They are horrified and wipe away the blood. \nThe fighters stand toe to toe and drag every remaining bit of strength from their souls and beat each other without mercy.  They look hypnotized and have entered a dimension far beyond blood and pain. \nSIX FIVE FOUR THREE TWO ONE! \nANOTHER ANGLE \nThe BELL RINGS... The arena EXPLODES with thunderous approval. \nTheir cornermen rush to their collapsed fighters... In the midst of all the confusion both fighters look at each other with unabashed respect -- They stand like blood-drenched gladiators on the most dramatic night of their lives. \nAs though reacting to some unspoken command, they both step towards each other and embrace... Apollo whispers in Rocky's ear. \nAPOLLO ... Ain't gonna be no rematch. \nROCKY ... Don't want one. \n", "test1_input": "COMMENTATOR Still to be held in Philadelphia? \nAPOLLO The Bicentennial Heavyweight Championship of the World is gonna be held in the only place it can be held -- Philadelphia! -- the nation's cradle -- January First -- the first major event of our two hundredth year. \nCOMMENTATOR Where're you off to now? \nApollo draws his wife close. \nAPOLLO Me an' my wife are goin' home 'cause we miss our children an' can't go no more time without seein' them. \nCOMMENTATOR Any quick advice for young boxing hopefuls? \nAPOLLO (looks straight into the camera) ... Stay in school an' use your brains, dig -- Be a lawyer, be a doctor, carry a leather briefcase an' forget about sports!!  Sports can only make ya grunt an' smell -- Be a thinker not a stinker!! \nApollo's entourage laughs and they move on... The Commentator faces the camera. \nCOMMENTATOR Jerry Simpson at Kennedy Airport with the Champion, Apollo Creed. \nThe sports show cuts away, but Rocky continues to look at the television with a pensive stare... Andy has been speaking the following dialogue over Apollo's broadcast. \nANDY Nobody cares what's happenin' in the world of sports nomore -- Downhill.  Baseball, downhill -- Basketball, downhill.  Football's goin', too.  Bank on it.  Baseball use to be America's best sport... Sure -- Nuttin' like squattin' through a great double header, but now baseball's all business. \nThe news report with Apollo ends.  Andy drinks. \nANDY (continuing) Where are the real fighters? The pros.  Today we jig clowns. \nROCKY Clown. \nANDY Yeah. \nROCKY He took his best shot an' became champ -- What shot did you ever take? \nANDY Yo, Rock, you ain't happy with yourself?  Fine.  But me, I gotta business here -- I don't need to take no shot. \nBecoming despondent, Rocky rises and crosses to Paulie slumped unconscious in the booth. \nRocky exits the bar... Andy turns to his customers. \nANDY (continuing; boldly) Take a shot, he says! -- Sure, I'll take a shot! \nLaughing, Andy pours himself a shot. \nEXT. ATOMIC HOAGIE SHOP - NIGHT \nRocky passes an all-night sandwich shop... In the window hangs the sign \"ATOMIC HOAGIE SHOP, INC.\" Out front are several YOUNG MEN and WOMEN.  They are much too young to be out so late... A boy with a badly-chipped tooth beckons to Rocky. \nCHIPPED TOOTH (aggressively) Yo, Rocks, buy us sum wine, man. \nROCKY ... No wine -- Bad for ya' brain. \nCHIPPED TOOTH C'mon, man, it's cold, man. \nROCKY No wine. \nCHIPPED TOOTH Yo, Rock, gimme a dollar. \nROCKY Why? \nCHIPPED TOOTH (sarcastically) 'Cause we dig ya, man -- Gimme a dollar. \nROCKY No dollar. \nCHIPPED TOOTH Hey, give Rocky a dime. \nYOUNG MAN #2 ... How come? \nCHIPPED TOOTH So he can call all his friends. \nROCKY (mildly embarrassed) ... That's an old one. \nCHIPPED TOOTH Buy us some Thunderbird, man. \nRocky ignores the statement and faces a very young girl who is smoking and leaning whore-like against the wall. \nROCKY Is that Marie? -- Marie, ya brother know you're hangin' out so late? \nThe girl, MARIE, assumes an indifferent attitude, attempting to impress her friends. \nMARIE ... Screw you. \n", "test1_true": "MARIE ... Screw you, yoyo. \nThe gang laughs.  Angered and shocked, Rocky grabs her arm. \nROCKY Did these guys teach you to talk dirty?  Huh? \nMARIE Hey -- \nROCKY What? \nMARIE Stuff it, man! \nROCKY (shakes her) Don't you never say that -- (to the gang) -- You guys talk like that in front of a little girl -- You guys are scum. \nCHIPPED TOOTH This is our place, dig! \nThe gang reluctantly backs up a step. \nROCKY Don't ya never come round this girl -- Go home. \nYOUNG MAN #2 This is our corner, man!  You go, chump! \nRocky moves forward and they scatter... They quickly move off. \nCHIPPED TOOTH (backpedaling) We'll kill you, man -- We gotta gun. \nROCKY Pull heat on me? -- I'll dent ya face! \nRocky leads the girl away. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nRocky is walking the young girl home... They are presently cutting through a dark public school yard.  They pass through the beams of light cast off by weak flood lights located at the top of the school building.  The atmosphere is somewhat eerie. \nROCKY How come ya wanna hang out with those guys?  They teach ya bad things. \nMARIE I like 'em.  If you don't you can f-- \nROCKY Hey!  When I was your age, there was only one girl who talked like that in the whole neighborhood. \nMARIE (bored) ... Yeah. \nShe attempts to light a cigarette... Rocky nonchalantly tosses it to the ground. \nROCKY Make your teeth yella -- \nMARIE I like yella teeth. \nROCKY Makes your breath like garbage. \nMARIE Maybe I like garbage. \nRocky and Marie take a shortcut through a dark school yard. \nROCKY Nobody likes garbage -- Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin', but the guys wouldn't take her out for any serious datin'. \nMARIE Why? \nROCKY 'Cause that's the way guys are -- They laugh when ya talk dirty.  They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. (MORE) \nROCKY (CONT'D) Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious.  Ya get no respect... I gotta use a bad word -- Whore.  You'll end up maybe becomin' a whore. \nMARIE C'mon, Rocky.  I'm twelve. \nROCKY That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it. \nMARIE What? \nROCKY Yo, a bad reputation -- Twenty years from now people will say 'D'you remember Marie?' 'No, who was she?' 'She was that little whore who hung out at the Atomic Hoagie Shop.' 'Oh, now I remember!'... See, they don't remember you, they remember the rep. \nRocky and Marie exit the dark school yard... Standing in the shadows of the building are three young muggers.  The light from their cigarettes flares red in their faces. \nThe muggers pace Rocky across the street and follow them down the block... Rocky sees them and stops and faces the three.  The muggers pause and study Rocky from a distance of twenty yards.  Rocky gives a loud boxer's snort, wipes his nose with the side of his thumb and rolls his shoulders... The muggers are intimidated and slowly peel off the meander away. \nRocky turns to Marie who has been standing behind him. \nROCKY (points down the block) ... That's your house, ain't it? \n", "test1_id": 2697, "test2_input": "DEMPSEY Good luck, kid. \nHe moves off. \nROCKY (to Mickey) Christ, Jack Dempsey. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nThe Announcer points and the timekeeper RINGS the BELL. \nANNOUNCER Former Middleweight Champion -- 'The Bronx Bull' -- Jake LaMotta! \nJAKE LA MOTTA raises his fist and gives best wishes to both contenders... Timekeeper RINGS the BELL. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nANNOUNCER (continuing) The man with the big punch -- Everybody's favorite, 'The Brown Bomber ' -- Joe Louis! \nJOE LOUIS bows and steps to Creed's corner.  Creed strikes a boxing pose and Louis tosses a playful punch. ROCKY They must be friends. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nANNOUNCER Now, last but certainly not least -- the former Heavyweight Champion, a son of Philly, Smoking Joe Frazier! \nFRAZIER rumbles to the center of the ring.  The CROWD CHEERS. Apollo puts on a show... He grimaces and gestures like he's going to attack Frazier.  His cornermen hold him back.  They laugh.  Frazier goes to Rocky's corner. \nFRAZIER Save some of him for me. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nThe Commentators beckon to Frazier as he exits the ring. \nCOMMENTATOR #1 The former champ looks great -- Can we get Joe over here -- here he comes. \nJoe Frazier stands in front of the Commentators. \nCOMMENTATOR #1 (continuing) Joe, what are your feelings about tonight's fight? \nFRAZIER Well, I think any man who works an' trains hard always gotta chance. \nCOMMENTATOR #2 You look in great shape, Joe. \nFRAZIER I'm always in shape. \nJoe laughs and exits.  The timekeeper RINGS the BELL. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nANNOUNCER ... Now for the evening's main event -- In the corner to my right, The Challenger, wearing white trunks -- At one hundred an' ninety-one pounds, one of Philly's own sons -- 'The Italian Stallion,' Rocky Balboa! \nA good CROWD RESPONSE. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nANNOUNCER In the far corner, wearing red, white an' blue -- Weighing in at two hundred and ten pounds -- Undefeated in forty- six fights -- the Heavyweight Champion of the World -- 'The Master of Disaster' -- Apollo Creed! \nThe arena EXPLODES and Creed puts on a display of hand speed. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nThe REFEREE motions to both fighters... They step to the center of the ring.  As the Referee explains the rules Apollo and Rocky stare hard into each other's eyes... The Referee's voice fades and the fighters' expressions fill the screen... Something soulful and frightening is being communicated. \nREFEREE ... Now come out fighting. \nThe fighters return to their corners. \nMICKEY God bless ya, Rock. \nROCKY Thanks, Mick -- I'm gonna try. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nThe BELL RINGS... Creed dances forward and boxes Rocky as though he considers the man an amateur. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nCOMMENTATOR #1 The Champ stings the slower challenger with jabs at will -- Balboa blocks eighty percent of the blows with his face -- Creed doesn't look the best he's ever been but is moving smoothly -- Creed snaps out a triple combination that backs Balboa into a corner -- oh, a solid hook by Creed, a master of fist-men. \nCOMMENTATOR #2 The Champion is smiling and toying with the man -- trying to give the fans their money's worth and make a show of it with the badly out-classes challenger -- Another left to right combination.  I feel sorry for -- \n", "test2_true": "ANOTHER ANGLE \nRocky suddenly explodes with an upswing hook to the jaw. Creed is dropped.  The arena EXPLODES.  Creed's eyes show disbelief.  So do Rocky's. \nRocky backs into his corner... Mickey and Mike yell at him. \nMICKEY You can do it!  Goddamnit, you got the power!  The body, get the body!!!  Ya got him goin'! \nREFEREE Six!... Seven!... Eight!... \nCreed is up... His playful attitude is gone... he is now all business.  His lightning jab stings Rocky's face repeatedly. \nAPOLLO ... Come at me, sucker! \nRocky charges and a terrific right crashes against Apollo's chin, followed by an uppercut to the liver that causes Creed to cringe... \nApollo counters with jabs and Rocky whips brutal combinations to the body. \nThe BELL RINGS. \nROCKY'S CORNER \nROCKY How am I doin'? \nMICKEY Real good. \nROCKY See how fast he is -- damn! \nMICKEY Breathe deep -- Keep ya chin down!!  Use the legs and drive through 'im.  Attack -- Attack -- Attack! \nAPOLLO'S CORNER \nApollo does not sit.  He stands and clowns with the spectators to prove he is not hurt. \nAPOLLO (to Trainer) ... That boy damn near broke my arm. \nTRAINER Sure -- He can hit -- Don't play no more -- Stick an' move, hear? \nAPOLLO I'll carry him 'till the third. \nTRAINER Don't play with this man, he's fightin' hard -- Let 'em feel some real heat! \nANOTHER ANGLE \nThe BELL for the second round RINGS... Rocky rushes out fast and furious.  Apollo melts out a left hook that raises a goose egg over Rocky's eye... Apollo employs footwork that dazzles Rocky.  He has class.  He studies Rocky and employs his lightning jab with cutting accuracy. Still Rocky shuffles ahead, bombarding Creed's midsection with hooks. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nThe round ends with Apollo assaulting Rocky with blinding combinations and delivering a stupendous right cross that flings Rocky into the ropes and shatters his nose... The round ends. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nApollo stands in his corner and jokes with the fans, but he is beginning to show the strain from the body punches. \nAPOLLO Man, I rearranged his face with that right -- The people love what's happenin' tonight. \nTRAINER People nothin', you in a fight, my man, -- ya best believe what you hear... Knock that boy out soon an' let's go home. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nRocky sits as Mickey and Benny try to reduce the swelling around his eyes... The nose is shattered. \nMICKEY Ya nose is broke. \nROCKY Damn!  How's it look? \nMICKEY Can't hardly tell.  Don't swallow the blood -- Go for his ribs.  Don't let 'im breathe. \nROCKY ... The guy's great. \nMICKEY Why don't ya tell 'im you're a fan! \nANOTHER ANGLE \nThe Commentators are caught up in the action.  They speak rapidly into their microphones. \nCOMMENTATOR #2 If you had asked anyone who knows boxing, they never would've predicted a first round knockdown and the second round punishment to the body of the Champion... Most fighters will tell you, receiving a good body punch is the next worst thing to dying. \n", "test2_id": 2698, "test3_input": "COMMENTATOR #1 Round three ready to start and should be interesting to see if Creed can put the challenger away -- there goes the bell. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nRound three... Apollo comes out dancing.  He skips and side- steps Rocky's sledgehammer hooks.  An expert ring general, Apollo uses the ring fully.  Rocky keeps tearing in and Creed meets the bombing attack that cause thick swelling... Near the end of the round Rocky fires a penetrating punch to the heart. \nCOMMENTATOR #1 Apollo almost sprints out of his corner -- feints and throws a pair of left-right combinations.  Balboa drops beneath a left upper cut and lands a very solid shot on Creed's temple -- not much movement from Balboa, duck a left, a right, another left and explodes with a right hook to the temple -- I mean explodes.  The Champ backs off. \nCOMMENTATOR #2 There's no way Apollo expected this kind of hitting power. \nCOMMENTATOR #1 No way -- but the brilliant ability of the Champion to master situations like this is one of his most outstanding traits -- Creed tosses a perfect right hand that rocks Rocky. (MORE) \nCOMMENTATOR #1 (CONT'D) Creed on the offensive -- Balboa takes the punishment and counters with a left flush over the heart... that hurt. \nThe wallop knocks Apollo off balance... The CAMERA GOES TO A STEEP ANGLE SHOT from the floor, VERTICALLY UP Apollo's body. The SCENE GOES INTO SLOW MOTION... Rocky releases a terrifying uppercut that opens a gash under Creed's eye. Creed's face contorts with excruciation. \nTRAINER (yelling) Cover your face!  Cover up! (to Assistant) My man's cut, my man's bleedin' -- Get ready! \nANOTHER ANGLE \nThe BELL SOUNDS.  Apollo's corner works frantically to close the wound... The ring DOCTOR inspects the cut. \nTRAINER Bad?  Talk to me, man! \nDOCTOR Deep, but passable. \nAPOLLO (staring at Rocky) ... That man's takin' his job too serious. \nTRAINER He's movin' to your left -- don't let him no more -- dance and stick, hear?  Don't play -- I know what ya feelin', but don't play. \nAPOLLO He got lucky. \nTRAINER Luck!  You fightin' a crazy man -- but you got him hurt bad. (to Assistant) More ice, now! \nANOTHER ANGLE \nRocky's face is in very bad shape, not cut, but wretchedly swollen around the eyes. \nMICKEY How you holdin' up, kid? \nROCKY Fine... That guy's great. \nMICKEY Gimme the water!  Ya getttin' tagged with his right.  I think you should feint left and high hook 'im -- Benny, check the eyes!  Can ya see? \nROCKY (standing) See what? \nMIKE Ya sappin' his strength -- He's losin' steam. \nROCKY He ain't losin' nothin'. \nMICKEY Keep on him -- You're doin' great. \nSERIES OF SHOTS \nIn the next ten rounds, Apollo cuts and slashes Rocky to ribbons, but pays dearly... Both his eyes and lips are cut. Welts across his midsection attest to Rocky's body-battering. \nINT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT \nAdrian is unable to remain alone... She is lured by the GROWING ROAR OF THE FANS... She exits the dressing room. \nINT. ARENA HALL - NIGHT \nStepping out of the dressing room she walks down the corridor. The MOUNTING CHEERS make her speed up.  She opens the door at the end of the corridor and is hit by a THUNDEROUS WAVE OF SOUND.  The guard at the door inspects her and goes back to watching the fight. \nINT. ARENA - NIGHT \nAdrian stands at the rear of the arena and watches the battle.  She is entranced by the power of it all. \nBack in the ring, Rocky keeps grinding ahead.  He plants a thumping left over the Champion's heart and Creed winces... Rocky is game but losing. \nAt ringside Paulie is frantic... He is living the fight from his seat. \nMr. Gazzo and his Bodyguard watch from the second row. Gazzo looks proud.  The Bodyguard, impassive. \nINT. ANDY'S BAR - NIGHT \nA huge and lively crowd look up at the television over the bar... They see Rocky driving Creed against the ropes and cheer loudly. \nANDY ... The Rock's got real stones. \n", "test3_true": "The men are fighting with appalling tenacity.  Rocky rips and tears into the body... Apollo counters with a ceaseless stream of rapier-like lefts... The Challenger is seriously outclassed. \nAPOLLO C'mon -- Lemme cut yo'! \nRocky wades in and Creed employs incredible footwork.  He sets himself and cuts loose with a thunderbolt right cross to Rocky's already broken nose.  Blood sprays from the wound and red droplets drip from his chin... \nRocky takes a merciless beating and is staggered by a torrent of combinations.  Rocky's eyes are closed.  But Creed cannot drop him... The BELL RINGS. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nThe Commentators shift in their seats. \nCOMMENTATOR #1 Without a doubt this is the most punishing brawl I have ever seen -- The ringside audience is spotted with blood. (MORE) \nCOMMENTATOR #1 (CONT'D) This fight should have been stopped rounds ago but Rocky Balboa refuses to fall -- \nCOMMENTATOR #2 Not only has he refused to fall, but he has beaten the Champion's body without mercy and the bout has become a vicious slugfest. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nApollo's corner is in turmoil... The Champion is definitely hurt. \nAPOLLO My side. \nTRAINER (to Assistant) Get that doctor. \nAPOLLO No doctor! \nTRAINER You're hurtin', man! \nAPOLLO No doctor!... I'm feelin' good, bro! \nANOTHER ANGLE \nIn Rocky's corner, things are frantic.  His eyes are swollen shut. \nMICKEY Wanna keep goin'? \nROCKY Would you keep goin'? \nMICKEY ... Yeah. \nMIKE No more, ya wanna lose an eye? No more. \nROCKY Open my eyes -- Please, open my eyes! \nMickey nods to Benny.  He secretly places a small ring knife between his index and middle finger.  In one smooth movement he drags the razor over the blood welts and quickly covers the draining wounds with gauze... It is done so quickly no one is ever aware of the operation. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nAt the rear of the arena Adrian looks transfixed at the ring. She is caught up in the heat of the battle. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nThe BELL RINGS for round fourteen.  Rocky bores in close, but Apollo still has spring in his legs.  He seems determined to end it this round... Apollo catches Rocky flush on the jaw.  Rocky is staggered.  Like a wolf, Apollo cuts loose with pure savagery.  Rocky is driven against the ropes and receives a devastating beating from the Champion... Rocky is dropped. \nRocky sits stunned in the middle of the ring... Everything is a distortion.  He looks for familiar faces as though to ask for help... Mickey and Mike scream frantically for him to stay down. \nREFEREE Six -- Seven -- Eight -- \nRocky gets to his feet and tenses with renewed energy.  He is like a wounded wild animal.  The tide suddenly turns. Rocky drops low and catches Apollo with a pair of terrific body punches that seem to drive Apollo's diaphragm up to his throat... A CRACK is HEARD.  A glaze of pain covers Apollo's eyes.  It is only a supreme effort that keeps the Champion upright... Apollo is badly hurt.  He is bent over. \nRocky moves towards Apollo.  Apollo flicks dread jabs into Rocky's eyes... The Italian wades in with punches that seem to bulge out Apollo's back.  Creed takes the punishment like a stoic. \nBlood is running from Apollo's mouth.  In the clinch he leans over Rocky and it drips down the Italian's neck and shoulders.  Apollo shields his wound from the ringside judges and continues to fight. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nThe BELL RINGS.  Apollo's men rush out and guide him to his corner. \nAPOLLO ... Ribs broke -- \nBlood trickles from the corner of Apollo's mouth.  The Trainer feels the ribs. \nTRAINER Yo' bleedin' inside, man -- Get that doctor. \nAPOLLO One more round. \n", "test3_id": 2699}

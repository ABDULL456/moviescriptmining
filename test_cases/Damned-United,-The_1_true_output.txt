`Crash', the following morning, CLOUGH bursts through swing doors, and into corridors with the CLEANERS...

CLOUGH Spick and span, understand? Wash these walls down. Give the floors a proper polish. 
17   EXT. PITCH - BASEBALL GROUND - DAY - (1968)                    17 
CLOUGH inspects the pitch with the HEAD GROUNDSMAN.. 
CLOUGH I want it perfect. Like a fucking carpet. We've got proper footballers coming. Who know how to keep the ball on the deck. 
GROUNDSMAN Well, you can't fucking train on it then. 
18   EXT. PITCH - PUBLIC PARK - DERBY - DAY - (1968)                18 
The Derby PLAYERS train on a football pitch in a public park. CLOUGH turns to TAYLOR.. 
CLOUGH You know he'll be making a file on us. A dossier. 
TAYLOR Who? 
CLOUGH Don Revie. Prepares a file on every game. Leaves nothing to chance. Knows every opponents formations. Strategies. Everything. 
TAYLOR I've heard he's a superstitious twat. (calling out) Ey..! Help him, someone HELP him..! 
CLOUGH We grew up just a few streets apart, you know. In Middlesborough, close to Ayrsome Park. He'll have known my street, Valley Road - probably bought sweets from Garnetts Factory, where my dad worked. 
TAYLOR Heard he wears the same suit to every game. His "lucky blue suit". (MO RE)                         (CO NTINU ED) 
13A 18   CON TINUE D:                                                  18 TAY LOR (cont'd) And he doesn't care for ornamental birds. C'mon, who's covering him...!

18   CON TINUE D: (2)                                              18 
CLOUGH The best manager in the country, Don Revie. Played for Sunderland, like me, as a centre-forward, like me, and England, like me. 
TAYLOR (shouting out) C'mon, give it and go! 
CLOUGH Peas in a pod, me and Don. Two peas in a fucking pod. 
19   INT. CORRIDOR - BASEBALL GROUND - DAY - (1968)                19 
CLOUGH in early. Before anyone. In shirtsleeves, sweeping corridors. Straightens photos on the wall. 
20   INT. ANOTHER CORRIDOR - BASEBALL GROUND - DAY - (1968)        20 
CLOUGH polishing the sign, `VISITORS' on the dressing-room door. 
21   INT. BATHROOMS - BASEBALL GROUND - DAY - (1968)               21 
CLOUGH on his knees, scrubbing, cleaning baths in the visiting team's washrooms. 
22   INT. MANAGER'S OFFICE - BASEBALL GROUND - DAY - (1968)        22 CLOUGH puts on his suit. Ties his tie. He takes a bottle of vintage red wine from a cupboard. 
He places the bottles on his desk. Then puts two cut crystal glasses on his desk. His and Don's. 
A flicker of jealousy on PETER TAYLOR's face, almost like a wife - hurt that his friend is making such an effort for someone else. 
A knock on the door. JIMMY GORDON appears in the doorway.. 
JIMMY They're here! (a confused look) Well, almost.. 
23   EXT. CAR PARK - BASEBALL GROUND - DAY - (1968)               23 
CLOUGH rushes out of the doors, straightening his cuffs, straightening his hair, buttoning his jacket. First out to greet the arriving team. 
He turns the corner to see the LEEDS COACH a hundred yards down the street, the PLAYERS getting off the coach and walking towards him.. 
CLOUGH What are they doing? 
JIMMY They've run out of petrol. 
TAYLOR No, it's that superstition, isn't it? Every away cup ties, Revie makes them walk the last hundred yards. TAYLOR mutters under his breath, "Soppy twat".

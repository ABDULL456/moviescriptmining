HOLLY (v.o.) Often I've wondered what was going through Kit's head before they got him and why he didn't make a run for it while he still had the chance. Did he figure theyld just catch up with him the next day? Was it despair? He claimed to having a flat tire, but the way he carried on about it, I suspect this is false. 
EXT. ROAD 
Kit shoots a hole in the tire of the Cadillac, then climbs up on the hood. We see how far behind the police are. He checks his pulse and jumps back down. He scurries around collecting rocks from the shoulder as the police approach from the distance. He makes a stack of the rocks to mark the site of his capture for posterity, finishing just as the police car skids to a stop. Kit throws up his hands and walks forward to meet them. Their guns are drawn. 
KIT Hi. 
SHERIFF Hold it right there. 
KIT I could've held off an army if I could've gotten behind a rock in the mountains. 
DEPUTY (o.c.) Oh yeah? 
KIT (nodding) Long as my ammo held out... Right there's where you caught me. 
He nods at the stack of rocks. The Sheriff frisks him as the Deputy covers. 
DEPUTY We did it, Ray. 
KIT You better not leave that Cadillac sitting out here. 
The Sheriff takes out a pair of handcuffs. 
SHERIFF Put your hands in back of your head. 
The Sheriff claps the handcuffs on one of Kit's wrists. 
SHERIFF Now put the other one on yourself. 
Kit does as the Sheriff asks. The Deputy holsters his pistol and walks forward to inspect their prize. He and KIT exchange glances. 
DEPUTY (to Sheriff) Hell, he ain't no bigger than I am. 
The Sheriff sticks his pistol in Kit's ear and leads him off toward the police car. 
KIT You're going to give me a cauliflower ear, Sheriff. 
The Sheriff gives Kit a shove. 
DEPUTY He should've thought about that before he got caught... Shouldn't he? 
The Deputy draws his pistol and fires a shot into the neighboring field. Kit is startled. The Deputy makes the same motion, this time without firing. 
DEPUTY Hup! 
EXT. HIGHWAY 
The police car sails down an open stretch of highway.

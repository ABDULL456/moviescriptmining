Behind them on the hill, Gary tries to retrieve his nephew's Snowrider from the Bully.  He is failing. 
DAVE Show me what?  An empty trash dumpster?  It was supposed to look like an accident.  I was hoping to see it in the paper.  So help me, if this guy pops up somewhere... 
While Jimbo does his best to stay warm, behind him on the hill, Gary can only watch as the Bully slides away. 
BULLY (echoing in the cold) Fag!  Big homo! 
JIMBO He won't.  He can't.  He's -- 
DAVE Proof, Jimbo.  I like to know my money's well spent. You got a week. 
Dave drives off as Gary walks over with his SNIFFLING nephew. 
GARY Slippery little sucker.  You mind if we stop at a toy store on the way back?

HIGH ANGLE ON:  Paul and Margaret in bed.  Margaret takes up more than her share of the bed, her arm tossed over her husband.  Paul, on his third of the bed, looks as if he's lying in state. But Paul's not sleeping. 
34    EXT.  BARNELL HOME - MORNING                                                  34 
A newspaper clears the "For Sale - price reduced!" sign on the front lawn and lands with a THUD on the steps. 
35    INT.  GARAGE - CONTINUOUS                                                     35 
Paul has the "Morning News" on the hood of his car.  He looks over at the fridge, still padlocked. 
PAUL (to himself) Let's see if anyone's missing you. 
He flips through each section.  There's nothing.  Paul walks to the fridge. 
PAUL (cont'd) (to the corpse) I don't know what kind of man let's himself just freeze to death in the trash, but I was never one to preach.  Way I see it, you've probably got family somewhere and they'd probably appreciate seeing you get a decent funeral, even if it's not really... yours. 
Paul, somewhat befuddled, gently pats the fridge door.

Margaret pushes the vacuum across the floor, humming to herself.  Paul walks by slipping into his coat.  He notices that the vacuum isn't plugged in.  Without missing a beat, he walks over and plugs it into the outlet.  The VACUUM ROARS TO LIFE.  Margaret doesn't flinch.  Paul heads out the door.

A ways out in the forest.  Only two houses on this turn-out; a cozy looking lived in cabin sits up the road from a seemingly deserted rundown mobile home.  A car pulls up. 
A40   INT. PAUL'S CAR - CONTINUOUS                                                 A40 
Paul adjusts a pillow he has taped to his stomach, then pulls on a blue ski mask. 
41    EXT. BARNELL MOBILE HOME - MOMENTS LATER                                      41 
Paul undoes the bungee cord and drags his snowblower out of the trunk.  He fires up the snowblower and starts to plow the drive way of both houses. 
MRS. WHERRY (80s), in her bathrobe, looks out the window of the cozy cabin. A tad confused, she waves to the man in the blue parka.  The blue parka waves back. 
42    INT.  PAUL'S KITCHEN - NIGHT                                                  42 
Paul walks in from the garage, pulling off his blue parka.  Margaret enters from the living room.  (Paul still has the pillow taped to his front, which Margaret happily pokes with a finger but never mentions.) 
MARGARET (nervous) He's not here, is he? 
PAUL Sweetie, don't you worry about Raymond. 
MARGARET When he's around, it just brings back... Fuck. 
PAUL I know.  He, he said he's probably gonna head back down South soon. 
Margaret smiles, relieved.  The phone RINGS.  Paul picks up. 
43    INT. MRS. WHERRY'S HOME - CONTINUOUS                                          43 
Mrs. Wherry talks on the phone in her kitchen.  The head of a large antelope is mounted on the wall behind her. 
MRS. WHERRY Paul?  Thank you so much for clearing the drive way. That was most considerate. 
PAUL I'm afraid I don't understand Mrs. Wherry.

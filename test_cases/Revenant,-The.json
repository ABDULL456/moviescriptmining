{"test1_input": "BRIDGER Christ Almighty. \nHenry, Pig, and the others reach the edge. \nHENRY Glass! \nNo answer. And all they can see is the bear, so they scan the trees. \nPIG HUGH! \nStill nothing. So Bridger takes off down the slope... losing his balance but rolling back to his feet. He reaches the bear... sees GLASS' MANGLED ARM STICKING OUT FROM BENEATH IT. \nBRIDGER He's down here! \nBridger uses all his strength to push the bear off, as the other men scramble down. But Bridger can't budge the massive carcass... not until Stubby Bill and Pig join in... shove the animal over, revealing the bloody mass that is Hugh Glass... \n...his throat is torn wide open... scalp peeled back from just above his eyebrows, hanging off the skull... stomach and chest a gruesome design of gashes and cuts. His right leg is snapped, the jagged bone jutting out through the skin. \nBridger's legs give out... he drops to a knee and vomits. \nMURPHY Oh, Jesus. \nSTUBBY BILL He's tore to pieces. \nThe men stare down at Glass' corpse. \nANDERSON Least he took that Grizz down with him. \nFITZGERALD Wished he'da done it without firing his rifle. If there wasn't no `Ree around before, there will be now. \nAnd that's all Pig can stand... he TACKLES FITZGERALD... they roll to the ground. And in a flash Fitzgerald is on top, raining punches down on Pig... turning his face into a bloody mess. \nHenry and Anderson grab Fitzgerald... drag him off. \nHENRY THAT'S ENOUGH! \nThen somehow, GLASS GASPS... this horrible, GUTTURAL MOAN. \nBRIDGER Holy Christ, he's alive. \nHenry and Bridger fall to their knees beside Glass. Glass looks up at the men, tries to focus through the blood and pain. His breathing is just a GURGLING WHEEZE... bubbles forming along the deep gashes in his throat with each gasp. \nHENRY Get me some water. \nStubby Bill tosses Henry his canteen. Henry empties it over Glass' throat... his face and scalp. The water hits the wounds and immediately transforms to blood. \nBRIDGER Oh, Jesus... Jesus. \nGlass lifts a trembling hand to his throat... feels the gaping wound. His eyes widen in horror. He COUGHS... the air splashes blood up from the open wounds in his throat. \nHENRY It's okay, Hugh. (pushing Glass' hand away) You're going to be fine. \nHenry spins his head away from Glass. \nHENRY (CONT'D) (WHISPERS) I need some rags before he bleeds out. \nPig whips a shirt from his bag... shreds it. \nHENRY (CONT'D) And your whiskey. \nPig tosses a bottle to Henry. Henry pours it over the gashes. The BURNING PAIN arches Glass... he CRIES OUT in that same horrific moan. \nHENRY (CONT'D) Hold him down, Bridger, goddammit. \nBridger throws his weight against Glass' shoulders. \nHENRY (CONT'D) The rest of you spread out... scout a circle around us. Fitzgerald, you and Anderson take west and north. Murphy and Mike south and east. Watch for anyone that might've heard that shot. \nAnd for the first time, Henry seems like a leader of men... firm... in complete control... just as Glass said he would be. So the men hurry off to their positions. \nPIG What about me, Cap? \nHENRY Get down here and help me tie off these wounds best we can. \n", "test1_true": "PIG It won't stop bleedin'. \nHENRY Shut up, Pig. (TO GLASS) We're fixing you up, Hugh. \nGlass is like a shredded rag doll... dazed eyes staring up at them as they work on his wounds... wrapping the rags around his throat... laying his scalp back over his skull, and tying another rag around it and under his jaw to hold it in place. \nBridger wipes the blood from Glass' face. \nBRIDGER It's gonna be fine, Mr. Glass. \nHenry glances down to the PUDDLE OF BLOOD spilling out over his knees... oozing out from beneath Glass. \nHENRY Roll him over... easy. \nThey gently push Glass onto one side, revealing DEEP, JAGGED, GASHES running across the width of Glass' back. Henry stares at the open flesh, ready to panic again... but he doesn't. Instead he looks to Pig. \nHENRY (CONT'D) Get me the kit. We need to stitch his back up. \nBRIDGER What about the rest of him? \nHENRY He's losing more blood back here. (off the throat) And I don't know what to do with that yet. \nPig digs out a thick needle and spool of black thread... hands it to Henry. Henry grabs the whiskey bottle. \nHENRY (CONT'D) I'm sorry for how this is about to burn, Hugh. \nHenry pours the whiskey over Glass' back. And the pain must be excruciating, because Glass lets out a HORRIBLE WAIL. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS \nFitzgerald and Anderson standing watch together in the trees. Glass' scream erupts through the trees, and they both immediately crouch down to a knee... out of sight to anyone out there that might have heard that. \nANDERSON They're torturin' the poor bastard. \nFITZGERALD And riskin' gettin' us killed in the process. Proper thing would be to end it for him quick. \nANDERSON `Less he could pull through. \nFITZGERALD You seen what that grizz did to him. Shit, Glass'll be dead inside a hour. We all will be if he keeps screamin' like that. \nEXT. WOODS - LATER \nSERIES OF SHOTS \nHENRY, BRIDGER AND PIG WORKING OVER GLASS... Bridger and Pig pressing Glass' scalp down, as Henry slides the needle and thread through the skin, suturing the wound. \nHENRY CLEANING GLASS' SHREDDED THROAT. \nBRIDGER AND PIG HOLDING THE SCREAMING GLASS DOWN AS HENRY SNAPS GLASS' LEG BACK IN PLACE. \nFITZGERALD PEERING BACK THROUGH THE TREES... to Henry doctoring Glass. Fitzgerald shakes his head in anger... turns back to the darkening forest. \nEXT. WOODS - EVENING \nGlass rests unconscious on the ground. Two branches act as a splint on his leg. A blanket covers his body... his face is like a swollen, disfigured, Frankenstein's monster... stitches of black thread holding it in place. \nHenry crouches a short distance away from him, rinsing his hands under a canteen. Bridger and Pig stand beside him. \nBRIDGER What now? \nHENRY We wait. Does he have any kin you know of? \nPIG He keeps to hisself. Never mentioned none. \nHENRY Go get the others. Tell `em we're making camp here for the night. \nPig starts hustling away. \nHENRY (CONT'D) And gather some wood, but make sure it's dry. We don't want much smoke when we cook that grizzly. \nANGLE ON THE MASSIVE BEAR... \n", "test1_id": 2301, "test2_input": "...lying dead on the ground, its claws and fangs soaked with blood... Glass' blood. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. WOODS - NIGHT \nAnd what's left of the grizzly... its fur cut away... slabs of flesh butchered from its skeleton. \nA fire burns at the center of camp... a chunk of meat roasts above the flame. The men sit around the fire... Murphy reaches up... tears a strip of meat from the roast, tossing it in his mouth. The men are silent... the pall of Glass' attack still hanging over them. \nBridger rises... walks to the Grizzly... crouches down over it, grabbing the animal's enormous paw. It dwarfs his own hand, as he examines the claws. Bridger pulls out his knife... stretches the claw out to its full length, and CUTS IT OFF AT ITS BASE. \nFITZGERALD (O.S.) What makes you think you earned a claw? \nBridger turns with a start... sees Fitzgerald standing over him, meat in his hand... his lips shiny with the grease. \nFITZGERALD (CONT'D) You didn't take that grizz down. \nBRIDGER It ain't for me. \nBridger stands... walks over to the sleeping Glass. Pig's already crouched beside him. Bridger lifts Glass' small leather POSSIBLES BAG from beside the Anstadt rifle... drops the claw inside... throws a look back to Fitzgerald. \nPig holds his palm out just above Glass' mouth. \nPIG I can feel some air outta his mouth. Maybe Captain sealed up his throat proper, huh? (off Bridger's silence) Whatta you figure his odds are, Jim? \nBridger stares down at what's left of Glass. \nBRIDGER Long. \nEXT. WILDERNESS - MORNING \nThe sun peeks over the horizon, sending an orange glow across the treetops. \nEXT. CAMP - MORNING \nANGLE ON GLASS... \n...unconscious but alive... his raspy breaths are weak and staggered. The SHADOWS OF MEN hover over him... \n...because Henry and the others surround Glass, staring down at him. \nMURPHY What that bear did to him... I didn't expect he'd last this long. \nANDERSON I seen a fella go a week once after a lion jumped him. Fever finally finished him off. \nSTUBBY BILL Whatta we do, Cap? \nA long beat, then... \nHENRY We give him his chance. \nHenry turns and walks away. \nEXT. CAMP - NIGHT \nThe fire has burned down to nothing. The men sleep scattered about. Murphy stands just outside of camp, rifle ready, keeping watch. \nGlass lies there awake... eyes wide open... a living corpse. And his breathing is just as labored as before... raspy, blood-soaked strains. \nFitzgerald tosses and turns, listening to Glass' gurgling. \nFITZGERALD You ain't doin' him or us no favors, Captain, lettin' him suffer that way. \nHenry's awake, but doesn't answer. He's holding his pistol in his hand, as he stares at Glass... thinking the same thing Fitzgerald just said. But he doesn't move... not yet. \nFitzgerald angrily wraps a blanket around his head, muffling the sound. Bridger sits beyond him... smiles at Fitzgerald's misery, as he attaches the BEAR CLAW TO A THIN LEATHER STRAP... a necklace. \nEXT. CAMP - MORNING \nBridger kneels over a SHIVERING GLASS, holding wet rags on his head. Pig and Henry stand over them, watching. \nFitzgerald, Anderson, Murphy and Stubby Bill sit huddled across camp. \n", "test2_true": "FITZGERALD I seen a bad one drag on days. \nANGLE ON GLASS... \n...eyes open... he can hear every word. \nFITZGERALD (O.S.)

Quiet, Fitzgerald. \nFITZGERALD... \n...points a stick at Glass. \nFITZGERALD (TO HENRY) We keep sittin' here watchin' him die, only gives the `Ree more chance to find us. \nHenry doesn't answer... just keeps staring down at Glass. \nBRIDGER He's burnin', Cap. Water turns to boil as soon as it touches him. \nHenry considers this, then... \nHENRY Pig, take Anderson and scout ahead. Grand should be just west of here. Find us the best route. \nFITZGERALD Tryin' to buy Glass time don't make sense for the rest of us, Captain. \nHENRY (TO PIG) Get movin'. \nPig nods... grabs his gear. He and Anderson take off out of camp. Henry turns... walks over to Fitzgerald and Stubby Bill. \nHENRY (CONT'D) (WHISPERS) You two can start digging a grave. \nFitzgerald tosses the stick away. \nFITZGERALD Least it's a step in the right direction. \nEXT. CAMP - LATER \nFitzgerald is covered in dirt and sweat, standing knee deep in Glass' grave. Stubby Bill stands over him. \nFITZGERALD Any coyote digs that deep deserves the meal. \nHe takes Stubby Bill's hand... pulls himself out. \nFITZGERALD (CONT'D) Glass won't know the difference no ways. \nPig and Anderson walk back into camp. \nPIG Found it, Cap. Right where Glass had us headed. \nANDERSON No more than a mile or so out. \nHenry looks to Bridger, still doctoring Glass. \nHENRY We could build a litter. Haul him with us. \nANDERSON It's rocky and steep goin'. \nHenry looks to Pig for an honest answer. \nPIG Marshy and thick on the other side. We could try it, but... \nPig shakes his head. \nFITZGERALD I signed on as a trapper, not a goddamn mule. \nBRIDGER (TO HENRY) Shape he's in... I don't see no way he'd make bein' drug. \nHenry nods, his mind racing for a solution. And before long, his hand is back on that pistol. He pulls it from his belt. \nThe other men all drop their heads... except for Fitzgerald... he's ready to see this end. \nHenry stares down at Glass. \n", "test2_id": 2302, "test3_input": "Fitzgerald shoves him away... Bridger stumbles and falls. Fitzgerald tosses the bloody rag at him. \nFITZGERALD (CONT'D) And I was just doin' your job... cleanin' him up. \nFitzgerald grabs Glass' Anstadt, almost daring Bridger to say something. Of course Bridger doesn't. Fitzgerald walks toward the trees. \nFITZGERALD (CONT'D) Why don't ya pour some more broth down his throat... keep him alive another week so we can fall farther back. End up walkin' all the way to Fort Union on our own. `Ree would love to poach on just two. (turns to Bridger) I promise ya, you'll look a helluva lot worse than Glass when they're done with you. \nBridger watches him disappear into the trees... wipes the blood from his lip with a trembling hand. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT \nFrom high above the trees. The world is silent... peaceful... until SEVERAL STARTLED CROWS shoot up from the treetops. \nCUT TO: \nBLACK... \n...the sound of FRENZIED BREATHING. \nFITZGERALD (V.O.) (PANICKED WHISPER) Bridger! Get your ass up! \nDim light fills the frame... then FITZGERALD'S FACE right in front of us. \nFITZGERALD (CONT'D) `Ree. \nBRIDGER - SCRAMBLES UP FROM UNDER HIS BLANKET, WIPING THE SLEEP FROM HIS FRIGHTENED EYES. \nBRIDGER What? \nFITZGERALD Keep quiet. I was down at the creek... there's twenty of `em at least, comin' this way. \nBRIDGER Oh, shit. Whatta we do? \nFITZGERALD We run. Now. \nAnd Fitzgerald's just whispering, but it's with such power that Bridger has no response... watches as Fitzgerald gathers his bag, starts throwing in food and supplies. Bridger is scared out of his mind... does the same... grabs for his rifle, resting near Glass. \nBridger freezes... in his panic, he'd forgotten all about Glass. And now the wounded man's eyes stare up at him... understanding perfectly what's happening around him. \nBRIDGER What about Glass? \nFITZGERALD He's on his own, same as us. \nBRIDGER I can't leave him. \nFITZGERALD Then I'm talkin' to a dead man. \nGlass gives Bridger the slightest of nods... go. But Bridger's frozen... doesn't know what to do... until Fitzgerald shoves him back to life. \nFITZGERALD (CONT'D) Move. \nGlass reaches out a weak hand out for his Anstadt... clawing for his weapon. Bridger starts to hand it to Glass, but Fitzgerald grabs it first. \nBRIDGER What're you doin'? He needs that. \nFITZGERALD He couldn't hold it if you tarred it to his hands. \nGlass strains to hold out his trembling hand for his gun. \nBRIDGER It's his goddamn rifle! That's all he's got! \nFITZGERALD And more than he'll need. \nFitzgerald scoops up Glass' knife as well. \nBRIDGER We can't leave him with nothin'. \nBut Fitzgerald is already sprinting away... disappearing into the trees. Glass stares after him, his once-calm eyes suddenly filled with a rage. And Bridger's frozen again, lost between duty and fear... until finally, he just shakes his head and takes off into the trees. \nGlass's empty hand falls back to the ground... he tries to yell out in anger, but his throat EXPLODES IN PAIN. His hand digs into the dirt... pulls him over onto his side. He flops over to his stomach... GASPS IN PAIN... then using his one good arm, drags himself over the dirt, his healthy leg pushing weakly at the ground, trying to propel him forward... a futile chase after Fitzgerald and Bridger... \n", "test3_true": "Then he spots that hole... the grave Fitzgerald dug for him. He grunts into action... grabs SEVERAL, THIN BROKEN BRANCHES from the ground, then claws forward, each movement excruciating... until finally, he reaches the hole, and ROLLS INTO IT... lands with a PAINFUL CRUNCH. \nHe rests there a moment, trying to regain any ounce of strength. Finally he fights through the pain... shoves the branches back up... spreading them across the hole as camouflage... a thin veil, but all that Glass has. \nHe lies there defenseless... INSIDE HIS OWN GRAVE. Hiding... listening for the Arikara's arrival... waiting to die. \nCUT TO: \nGLASS' POV - OUT OF THE GRAVE... TIGHT AND CLAUSTROPHOBIC... JUST THE NIGHT SKY THROUGH THOSE BRANCHES... AND THE SOUND OF HIS PAINFUL BREATHS. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. WILDERNESS - MORNING \nCold and grey. Fitzgerald crouches beside a small fire, warming his hands. WHISPS OF SMOKE rise into the sky. \nFITZGERALD We ran the better part of six hours. Had to gain some ground on Henry and them others. \nBridger sits at the base of a tree, not listening... staring... his mind replaying the desertion of Glass over and over. He notices the smoke. \nBRIDGER Best douse that smoke before them `Ree spot it. \nFITZGERALD We put enough distance between us and them. And it's too damn cold to go without one. \nBRIDGER All we know, they hoofed it through the night same as us. \nFITZGERALD (shakes his head) A dozen `Ree can't make the time us two did. \nBridger looks back to the trees... then considers something, stares at Fitzgerald a beat, before... \nBRIDGER It was twenty earlier. \nFITZGERALD What? \nBRIDGER When you woke me... you said you'd spotted twenty `Ree. \nFITZGERALD A dozen... twenty. I wasn't in a mood to count feathers. Hell, one `Ree woulda been too many. \nFitzgerald empties his canteen over the fire, killing the flames. Bridger stares at the water pouring out. \nBRIDGER What was you even doin' down at the creak in the middle of the night? (BEAT) I'd already brought plenty a water. \nFitzgerald doesn't answer. Bridger tightens his grip on his rifle... slowly rises. \nBRIDGER (CONT'D) Answer me. \nFITZGERALD Don't start questionin' me on accounta you feelin' guilty `bout leavin' your nigger buddy behind. \nBridger musters up all the courage he can... aims his rifle at Fitzgerald. \nBRIDGER ANSWER ME OR I BLOW YOUR DAMN HEAD OFF! \nFitzgerald stares back at Bridger and his rifle... eyes taking in everything... a snake sizing up its prey. Then Fitzgerald stands... takes a step toward the boy. \nFITZGERALD What're you askin'? Why it was you turned your back on Glass? Why you let him die to save your own sorry skin? (BEAT) `Cause you was scared shitless, that's why. \nBRIDGER The `Ree... did you see `em? (off Fitzgerald's silence) DID YOU SEE `EM? \nFITZGERALD (MOVING CLOSER) Not a one. \nBridger CRIES OUT... starts to pull the trigger, when Fitzgerald's hand flashes out, grabbing the barrel, and shoving the butt back into Bridger's face... THWACK. \nThe force of the blow knocks Bridger back to the ground, but Fitzgerald holds his grip on the rifle barrel... flips it around to aim it at the boy. Blood drips down Bridger's head as he stares up at his rifle pointed down. \nFitzgerald's finger tightens on the trigger. \nFITZGERALD (CONT'D) So that there is the answer to your question. \nAnd Fitzgerald PULLS THE TRIGGER... AND BRIDGER SQUEEZES HIS EYES SHUT IN FEAR... THEN CLICK. Bridger opens his eyes... sees Fitzgerald sneering down at him. \nFITZGERALD (CONT'D) And the next time you aim to kill somebody, kid, best remember your gun won't fire without a flint. \nFitzgerald tosses the rifle back at Bridger, and turns away. Bridger's face flushes with rage and humiliation... he charges Fitzgerald from behind... tackles him to the ground... starts pounding Fitzgerald with punches. \n", "test3_id": 2303}

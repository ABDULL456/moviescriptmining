{"train": "THE REVENANT \nWritten by \nMark L Smith \nBased on the novel by \nMICHAEL PUNKE \nSeptember 26, 2007 \nRevenge is an act of passion; vengeance of justice. \n- Samuel Johnson \nBased on a true story \nFADE IN: \nEXT. UPPER MISSOURI RIVER/1820'S - EVENING \nANGLE ON A SINGLE COTTONWOOD LEAF... brown and crisp... clinging to its empty branch... the solitary sign of life on an otherwise barren tree. \nA gust of wind... the leaf breaks free... flutters down, landing in the slow current of the Missouri. The last leaf of the fall, taking its final journey south. \nAs it floats along the surface, rising and falling with the current, all we can hear is the river's gentle movement... the trickle of water... the splash of timid rapids... until DISTANT VOICES invade this world... soft at first, but growing louder... LAUGHTER... SINGING. \nAnd then our leaf CRASHES INTO A WOODEN BOARD... the BOW OF A BOAT. We hear the VOICES EVEN CLEARER... MEN'S VOICES, as we rise up the bow... see it's a FLATBOAT BEACHED ON A SANDBAR at the center of the river. \nBeyond the flatboat are the voices... TWENTY MEN of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company, making camp along the shore... hauling wood, building campfires, pitching squares of canvas for makeshift rooftops. And this camp is full of life because these are some of the first men to ever see this untouched wilderness... men with a whole new world just waiting for them to claim their share. \nEXT. CAMP - EVENING \nCAPTAIN ANDREW HENRY, (late 20's), dressed in a buckskin jacket with long fringe... thick belt pulled tightly around his waist with two pistols and a knife hanging from it. He stands out among the others... like an imposter pretending to be a member of some exclusive club. He pulls off one of his gloves... examines the BLOOD-FILLED BLISTERS lining his palm. \nFrom across the camp, JOHN FITZGERALD, (40's), solid and thick... dark eyes of a killer, watches Henry. He nudges MACE BOONE, (40's), a thief in a previous life. \nFITZGERALD Likely got a splinter. Can't figure what to do without Mama here to pull it out for him. \nBoone chuckles... spits in Henry's direction. \nBOONE Need a doc, Captain? \nHenry looks up... sees Fitzgerald and Boone grinning at him. He slides his glove back on. \nHENRY Gather more wood. \nFitzgerald waits for Henry to turn, then gives his back an exaggerated salute. \nFITZGERALD (under his breath) Shame my Pap was a broken down drunk. Else he could've bought me a Captain's job too. \nBoone snickers. Fitzgerald stomps his boot onto a branch, easily snaps it into two easy-to-carry pieces. \nFITZGERALD (CONT'D) We got a plan for these fires, Captain, or are we roastin' berries all the way up to Fort Union? \nHENRY Glass and the others will be back with some game, Fitzgerald. Just make sure you have the fires ready. \nFITZGERALD My supper's in the hands of a hermit nigger, a kid and a dummy. Hell, my belly feels full already. \nFitzgerald's boot CRACKS another branch... and when it does, we hear the EXPLOSION OF A GUNSHOT. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. WILDERNESS - EVENING \nAnd a CLOUD OF SMOKE surrounding the LONG BARREL OF AN ANSTADT RIFLE. \nThe smoke fades, and at the other end of the rifle we see the face of HUGH GLASS, (40's), African-American, one eye still closed, as the other calmly stares down that barrel. \nVOICE (O.S.) Shit fire, you got him, Mr. Glass! \nGlass lowers the rifle, as PIG GILMORE, (30's), fat and filthy, races past. \nThe others exchange nervous glances... uh-oh. \nFitzgerald walks to Glass... snaps his fingers for Glass' Anstadt. \nFITZGERALD (CONT'D) Lemme see what's so special `bout that shooter of yours. \nNothing from Glass, so Fitzgerald grabs the barrel, but Glass holds firm. \nGLASS Middle of workin' on it. \nFITZGERALD Well you can stop workin' on it, and let me have a look like I said. \nFitzgerald gives another tug, but Glass' grip only grows tighter. His eyes roll up to Fitzgerald... make it clear he isn't giving up his rifle. And they hold that stare just as hard as they're holding Glass' rifle. \nFITZGERALD (CONT'D) You forget your place? \nGLASS Best I can tell, my place is right where I want it... on the smart end of my rifle. \nFitzgerald realizes the barrel he's holding is aimed right at his stomach, while Glass' hand seems suddenly very close to the trigger. But Fitzgerald's pride and that whiskey won't let him lose this tug of war. \nFITZGERALD I'd be careful if I was you, boy. \nAnd this thing's about to turn real ugly... until... \nHENRY That's enough, Fitzgerald. Go sober up and get to sleep. (MORE) HENRY(CONT'D) If you're passed out when we break camp tomorrow, I leave you here. \nFitzgerald holds his glare on Glass, then releases the rifle, shoving it back at Glass. He glances to Henry, and throws back a big gulp from the bottle just for spite, before backing away from Glass. \nFITZGERALD That's the trouble with this part of the world. No mirrors. Niggers forget what color they are. \nGlass ignores Fitzgerald... goes back to his rifle. Fitzgerald tosses the bottle at Anderson, then jerks his blanket up... walks off to sleep by himself. \nGlass glances up from his work... just long enough to give Bridger a nod. \nEXT. CAMP - LATER \nFitzgerald sleeping off that whiskey. The others snoring in a cluster at the center of the camp. Henry lies there awake... looks across to Glass, still sitting against the tree, a HANDRAWN MAP in his lap, as his eyes pierce the darkness. Henry eases over to Glass. \nHENRY Can't sleep either? \nGLASS Never like closin' my eyes when I'm not sure who'll be standin' over me when I open `em. \nHENRY I keep thinking about Boone and the others... how maybe I should've had us make camp further up river. \nGLASS The tracks I saw... those `Ree had been tailin' us for a while. They'd have gone as far north as it took. (BEAT) You're a good man, Captain. Soon as you realize that, these others will too. \nHenry likes hearing that... still isn't sure it's true. \nHENRY Your years trappin' and guidin' out here... have you had much experience with the Arikara? \nGLASS Enough to try and stay outta their way. \nHENRY (motions to Glass' map) But you know this country well enough to get us past them... up to Fort Union? \nGLASS I been here a long while. Whether that gets us to Union or not... \nHenry waits for more... doesn't get it. So he just nods and starts back to his blanket.... stops. \nHENRY What Fitzgerald said earlier... he doesn't speak for the rest. \nGLASS He wasn't wrong. Truth is that's what I prefer about this country... it's got no eye for the color of a man's skin. \nHENRY (BEAT) Try to get some sleep, Hugh. \nHenry climbs back under his blanket. Glass just sits there looking at the map. \nANGLE ON GLASS' MAP... \n...primitive at best. Sketched mountains... winding blue lines for rivers... small dots are scattered about with names beside them... \"Brazeau\", \"Talbot\", \"Union\". And DOZENS OF TRIANGLE PINE TREES have been drawn, representing the endless wilderness. \nWe TIGHTEN ON THOSE TRIANGLES until we're lost in them. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nBRIDGER Christ Almighty. \nHenry, Pig, and the others reach the edge. \nHENRY Glass! \nNo answer. And all they can see is the bear, so they scan the trees. \nPIG HUGH! \nStill nothing. So Bridger takes off down the slope... losing his balance but rolling back to his feet. He reaches the bear... sees GLASS' MANGLED ARM STICKING OUT FROM BENEATH IT. \nBRIDGER He's down here! \nBridger uses all his strength to push the bear off, as the other men scramble down. But Bridger can't budge the massive carcass... not until Stubby Bill and Pig join in... shove the animal over, revealing the bloody mass that is Hugh Glass... \n...his throat is torn wide open... scalp peeled back from just above his eyebrows, hanging off the skull... stomach and chest a gruesome design of gashes and cuts. His right leg is snapped, the jagged bone jutting out through the skin. \nBridger's legs give out... he drops to a knee and vomits. \nMURPHY Oh, Jesus. \nSTUBBY BILL He's tore to pieces. \nThe men stare down at Glass' corpse. \nANDERSON Least he took that Grizz down with him. \nFITZGERALD Wished he'da done it without firing his rifle. If there wasn't no `Ree around before, there will be now. \nAnd that's all Pig can stand... he TACKLES FITZGERALD... they roll to the ground. And in a flash Fitzgerald is on top, raining punches down on Pig... turning his face into a bloody mess. \nHenry and Anderson grab Fitzgerald... drag him off. \nHENRY THAT'S ENOUGH! \nThen somehow, GLASS GASPS... this horrible, GUTTURAL MOAN. \nBRIDGER Holy Christ, he's alive. \nHenry and Bridger fall to their knees beside Glass. Glass looks up at the men, tries to focus through the blood and pain. His breathing is just a GURGLING WHEEZE... bubbles forming along the deep gashes in his throat with each gasp. \nHENRY Get me some water. \nStubby Bill tosses Henry his canteen. Henry empties it over Glass' throat... his face and scalp. The water hits the wounds and immediately transforms to blood. \nBRIDGER Oh, Jesus... Jesus. \nGlass lifts a trembling hand to his throat... feels the gaping wound. His eyes widen in horror. He COUGHS... the air splashes blood up from the open wounds in his throat. \nHENRY It's okay, Hugh. (pushing Glass' hand away) You're going to be fine. \nHenry spins his head away from Glass. \nHENRY (CONT'D) (WHISPERS) I need some rags before he bleeds out. \nPig whips a shirt from his bag... shreds it. \nHENRY (CONT'D) And your whiskey. \nPig tosses a bottle to Henry. Henry pours it over the gashes. The BURNING PAIN arches Glass... he CRIES OUT in that same horrific moan. \nHENRY (CONT'D) Hold him down, Bridger, goddammit. \nBridger throws his weight against Glass' shoulders. \nHENRY (CONT'D) The rest of you spread out... scout a circle around us. Fitzgerald, you and Anderson take west and north. Murphy and Mike south and east. Watch for anyone that might've heard that shot. \nAnd for the first time, Henry seems like a leader of men... firm... in complete control... just as Glass said he would be. So the men hurry off to their positions. \nPIG What about me, Cap? \nHENRY Get down here and help me tie off these wounds best we can. \n...lying dead on the ground, its claws and fangs soaked with blood... Glass' blood. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. WOODS - NIGHT \nAnd what's left of the grizzly... its fur cut away... slabs of flesh butchered from its skeleton. \nA fire burns at the center of camp... a chunk of meat roasts above the flame. The men sit around the fire... Murphy reaches up... tears a strip of meat from the roast, tossing it in his mouth. The men are silent... the pall of Glass' attack still hanging over them. \nBridger rises... walks to the Grizzly... crouches down over it, grabbing the animal's enormous paw. It dwarfs his own hand, as he examines the claws. Bridger pulls out his knife... stretches the claw out to its full length, and CUTS IT OFF AT ITS BASE. \nFITZGERALD (O.S.) What makes you think you earned a claw? \nBridger turns with a start... sees Fitzgerald standing over him, meat in his hand... his lips shiny with the grease. \nFITZGERALD (CONT'D) You didn't take that grizz down. \nBRIDGER It ain't for me. \nBridger stands... walks over to the sleeping Glass. Pig's already crouched beside him. Bridger lifts Glass' small leather POSSIBLES BAG from beside the Anstadt rifle... drops the claw inside... throws a look back to Fitzgerald. \nPig holds his palm out just above Glass' mouth. \nPIG I can feel some air outta his mouth. Maybe Captain sealed up his throat proper, huh? (off Bridger's silence) Whatta you figure his odds are, Jim? \nBridger stares down at what's left of Glass. \nBRIDGER Long. \nEXT. WILDERNESS - MORNING \nThe sun peeks over the horizon, sending an orange glow across the treetops. \nEXT. CAMP - MORNING \nANGLE ON GLASS... \n...unconscious but alive... his raspy breaths are weak and staggered. The SHADOWS OF MEN hover over him... \n...because Henry and the others surround Glass, staring down at him. \nMURPHY What that bear did to him... I didn't expect he'd last this long. \nANDERSON I seen a fella go a week once after a lion jumped him. Fever finally finished him off. \nSTUBBY BILL Whatta we do, Cap? \nA long beat, then... \nHENRY We give him his chance. \nHenry turns and walks away. \nEXT. CAMP - NIGHT \nThe fire has burned down to nothing. The men sleep scattered about. Murphy stands just outside of camp, rifle ready, keeping watch. \nGlass lies there awake... eyes wide open... a living corpse. And his breathing is just as labored as before... raspy, blood-soaked strains. \nFitzgerald tosses and turns, listening to Glass' gurgling. \nFITZGERALD You ain't doin' him or us no favors, Captain, lettin' him suffer that way. \nHenry's awake, but doesn't answer. He's holding his pistol in his hand, as he stares at Glass... thinking the same thing Fitzgerald just said. But he doesn't move... not yet. \nFitzgerald angrily wraps a blanket around his head, muffling the sound. Bridger sits beyond him... smiles at Fitzgerald's misery, as he attaches the BEAR CLAW TO A THIN LEATHER STRAP... a necklace. \nEXT. CAMP - MORNING \nBridger kneels over a SHIVERING GLASS, holding wet rags on his head. Pig and Henry stand over them, watching. \nFitzgerald, Anderson, Murphy and Stubby Bill sit huddled across camp. \nHENRY Lay that rag over his eyes, Mr. Bridger. \nBRIDGER But, Captain. \nHENRY Do it. \nBridger hesitates, then reaches to fold the wet rag down over Glass' wide open eyes. And Glass must know what's happening, because his eyes roll up to Bridger's... his lips try to form a word... his hand digs its fingers into the dirt beside him. \nCUT TO: \nGLASS' POV - ON BRIDGER... \n...the boy looking away as he pulls the rag over our eyes... everything goes black. \nHENRY (O.S.) Step clear, Mr. Bridger. \nA LONG BEAT in the dark, waiting for that gunshot, then... \nBACK TO SCENE \nHenry standing over Glass... pistol aimed down. His hand trembles slightly. \nPig turns away... presses his hands over his ears. \nBridger takes a few steps back... stares at Henry. \nHenry struggles to steady his aim, until finally it calms... because he's thought of something else. \nHENRY (CONT'D) There's a seventy dollar bonus from the Rocky Mountain Fur Company to the two men that stay with Glass... see this through. Then give him a proper burial. \nBRIDGER I'll stay with him... money or not. \nPIG Same here. \nHENRY I can't let you stay back, Pig. Without Glass, I'll need you to scout. \nHenry looks to the others... they all drop their eyes... not interested. \nHENRY (CONT'D) Just need one more. \nFITZGERALD Two won't stand much chance against a party of `Ree, Captain, and seventy dollars won't buy me a new setta ears. \nHENRY A hundred then. \nStill nothing from the others. \nBRIDGER They can have my share too. I owe Glass that at least. \nFITZGERALD That case I'll hang back with the kid. I don't mind fallin' a day or so behind for two hundred. \nHENRY But Glass is to be cared for until. Understood? \nFITZGERALD (motions to Bridger) I'll let the young doctor do his job. \nHenry hesitates... doesn't like this, but knows it's the best option left. \nHENRY The rest gather your gear. \nBridger reaches down... lifts the rag from Glass' face. Their eyes meet... Bridger gives Glass a nod. \nEXT. CAMP - LATER \nHenry and the others are loaded and ready to leave. Pig bends down over Glass. \nPIG I'll see ya at Fort Union, Hugh. \nGlass's glazed eyes focus on Pig. He moves the only thing he can... BLINKS a \"yes\" back at him. \nHENRY (to Fitzgerald and BRIDGER) As long as necessary. \nBRIDGER I'll look after him. \nHenry turns... leads the men into the trees... toward the Grand... toward Fort Union. \nA few of them land, but it's only a moment before Fitzgerald is back in control... HEAD-BUTTING Bridger off of him... tossing him away, then KICKING BRIDGER IN THE STOMACH... AGAIN. He grabs his knife... is ready to finish Bridger off... \n...but Fitzgerald is smart enough to know that out here, two are safer than one... even when one is just a kid. He starts walking away. \nBRIDGER I'm goin' back for him. \nFITZGERALD Far as we ran all night, you couldn't find Glass with dogs and a map. And I don't believe you really want to. `Cause after leavin' him to die the first time, I doubt he'd be too happy to see you now. \nFitzgerald digs at the dirt with the knife... covers the fire's remains. \nFITZGERALD (CONT'D) And just so we're clear. If you try to backtrack without me knowin', or ever get so guilty you feel the need to tell somebody. \nFitzgerald looks at Bridger... hard... evil. \nFITZGERALD (CONT'D) I'll have no choice but to gut you from nuts to nose. \nFitzgerald stares his point home, then shoves the blade into his belt, and stands. \nFITZGERALD (CONT'D) Now let's go. \nBridger wipes the blood from his face, then throws one last glance behind him before following Fitzgerald. \nEXT. CAMP - MORNING \nEmpty and quiet... no sign of life... until GLASS' HAND RISES BETWEEN THE BRANCHES. His fingers dig into the earth, pulling himself up from the hole... a dead man climbing out of his own grave. \nHe rolls out to the ground... arches in pain when his back hits the cold, hard surface. Glass lies there shivering, regaining what little strength he has, then rolls over... starts dragging himself again with that one good arm. He makes it to the blanket... wraps it around him. \nGlass rests there in the center of camp... unable to move... his eyes scanning the surroundings... no food... no water... and he's wide open in this clearing... an easy target for any predator. So he grabs his Possibles bag and GUNPOWDER HORN, and drags himself toward the cover of brush. \nAnd every movement takes all the will Glass has... a push with his good leg followed by a pull with his healthy arm... inch by inch... foot by foot... sweat pouring down his face as he finally reaches the cover of the trees... continues on... dragging himself across the forest floor in a desperate, hopeless crawl for survival. \nBut finally it's too much for Glass... the fever and pain overwhelm him. He collapses... falls unconscious. \nEXT. WILDERNESS - DAY \nGlass lies in the dirt, weak... dehydrated... starving. He looks at his hands... scratched and bloody from clawing his weight. \nHe unwraps his small, leather Possibles bag... dumps it to the ground, revealing it contents... flints, a straight razor, his map, and a LEATHER NECKLACE WITH THE SIX-INCH BEAR CLAW attached. Glass grabs the razor... cuts SEVERAL THIN STRIPS FROM THE BLANKET, and wraps them around his hands. \nHe shoves the rest back in the bag, and does the only thing he can do... start crawling again... push with his healthy leg... pull with his good arm. \nEXT. WILDERNESS - LATER \nGlass dragging himself up a steep slope... over rocks... the jagged edges catching the wounds... tearing the primitive stitching. The gashes rip wider... blood oozes down, leaving a crimson trail dripping down the rock behind him. \nEXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT \nThe wind is howling through the trees. Glass lies beneath a cluster of brush... shivering... bleeding. Every aching breath creates a puff of smoke in the cold, night air. \nEXT. MARSH - DAY \nThick with a sea of four-foot high Cattails... like miniature cornstalks. Looking down from above the marsh we see a two- foot wide path of crushed plants that reaches the center of the marsh, and stops. \nWe tighten on the end of the path, until we see Glass lying among the Cattails. He's sawing off one of the stalks with the straight razor... peeling away the husk, and eating the tender flesh beneath. \nMosquitoes move in clouds around him... over his face... arms. But Glass' injured body only allows him one action at a time, so the mosquitoes have their fill of him, as he gnaws on the Cattail. \nEXT. WILDERNESS - DAY \nGlass pulling himself along the ground... stopping to tear a FEW BERRIES from a plant, and shove them in his mouth. He flinches as he swallows. He starts to move again, but freezes... listens... RUSHING WATER. \nGlass digs his fingers into the ground with new energy... pulls himself toward the sound... up over a ridge... and there it is at the bottom of the ridge... \n...THE GRAND RIVER... WATER. Glass crawls down toward it. \nEXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY \nGlass drags himself to the river's edge, cupping handfuls of water and rubbing it over his parched lips... withstanding the pain to gulp it down. \nAs he does, Glass notices a FISH hovering in the shallows beside him. He makes a desperate grab for the fish, but it darts easily away. \nGlass cups more water to his mouth, but with each drink, he feels the water leak from a hole in his throat... run down his neck. He leans out over the surface to check his reflection... barely recognizes the swollen, stitched- together, disfigured face staring back at him. He fights off the urge to vomit... pulls the razor from the leather bag, and cuts more strips of blanket, soaking them in the river, then cleaning his wounds. \nEXT. GRAND RIVER - NIGHT \nDark... the moon hidden behind clouds. A heavy mist hangs over the river. Glass is draped across the log, eyes closed... letting the slow current carry him south. But then his eyes open... because he hears something... a LOW RUMBLE. \nGlass looks to the river banks... too foggy to see anything clearly. The RUMBLE GROWS LOUDER. He peers ahead... too dark to see much... just ANOTHER SPLINTERED LOG floating in front of him, its one jagged branch rising up in the air. \nBut then THE LOG VANISHES. Glass squints through the fog, scanning the surface. But it's gone... the water's empty... that LOW RUMBLE GROWS EVEN LOUDER. \nGlass looks to the water beside him... a BRANCH GLIDES PAST AT A HIGHER SPEED. And now Glass knows what's coming, but it's too late... because the world suddenly turns upside down, as Glass tumbles over the edge of a TWENTY FOOT WATERFALL. \nHe spirals downward... crashes into the rushing current. He's washed forward with the suddenly violent rapids. They pull him under the surface, then toss him GASPING back out. \nThe river carries him blindly through the mist... tossing... turning... SLAMMING HIM INTO A HUGE BOULDER... CRACK... he spins off, swept away headfirst... the foaming water sucking him down the rocky gauntlet. \nHe tumbles over more boulders... his Possibles bag snaps loose... Glass makes a grab for it, but is suddenly flipped down another set of falls. \nThe Possibles Bag is lost in the raging river. \nGlass sinks beneath the surface, then floats back up, as the rapids calm... spit Glass to the gentle shallows. His body drifts face-down toward shore. \nAnd just when we're sure Glass has to finally be dead, his arm reaches up from the water... he digs his fingers into the muddy bank, and drags himself out of the river. \nGlass collapses unconscious to the ground, his body shrouded in that mist. \nEXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY \nTIGHT ON THE LEFT SIDE OF GLASS' FACE... the right still pressed into the muddy bank. The sun beats down... then SHADOWS APPEAR... BOUNCE ACROSS HIM... something is standing over Glass. \nAnd then a VULTURE'S HEAD DROPS INTO FRAME... \n...latches its beak onto Glass' cheek... tugs at it... stretches it. Glass' eyes pop open... we PULL BACK to see THREE VULTURES surrounding Glass' body, pecking and clawing at his battered wounds. \nGlass swings his good arm, knocking one of the vultures away. He tries to cry out, but only that PRIMITIVE HISS ERUPTS from his throat. \nThe vultures dance away from his flailing... aren't willing to give up their meal so easily... dart in for quick attacks on his flesh. \nGlass grasps a branch... swings at the birds, beating them back. The vultures give up the battle... fly away. \nGlass crumbles back to the ground... squints up into the sun... the SILHOUETTES OF THE VULTURES CIRCLING ABOVE HIM... waiting for him to die. \nGlass looks down to his wounds, again oozing blood. He glances around... sees a ridge just a few hundred yards away. \nAt the base of the ridge, a GIANT BOULDER has broken free, creating a partial cave. Glass starts crawling toward it. And if it's possible, he looks even closer to death now than when he started this journey. \nEXT. CAVE - DAY \nNo more than ten feet deep, but enough to hide from predators. Glass drags himself as far back in the recess as he can... collapses against the rock wall. \nINT. CAVE - DAY \nGlass gathers loose sticks and grass into a small pile... begins sparking rocks together to build a fire. \nINT. CAVE - LATER \nThe fire burns beside Glass, as he TEARS A SINGLE THREAD of cloth from the tattered blanket, then feeds it through a tiny hole in a JAGGED, NEEDLE-SIZED SLIVER OF SHARPENED ROCK... a man-made needle and thread. \nGlass goes to work on the open wounds of his chest... piercing his skin with the rock... wincing with pain as he tugs the thread through the fresh hole in his skin... pierces the other side of the wound, then pulls the flesh tightly together... before repeating the excruciating process all over again... pierce... pull... pierce... tighten. \nEXT. GRAND RIVER - NIGHT \nThe moon's glow reflects off the water. \nINT. CAVE - NIGHT \nANGLE ON GLASS' HAND... \n...holding a small sharp stone, and SCRATCHING LETTERS INTO THE CAVE'S ROCK WALL. \nWE PAN DOWN TO THE GROUND... still listening to the SCRATCHING OF THE ROCK as we glide across the dirt... reach the fire... its flame warm and strong. We TIGHTEN ON THE FIRE, until WE'RE INSIDE IT... and then WE PULL BACK... \n...and we see the fire has long died away... just black ash. The O.S. SCRATCHING has silenced. We glide back across the cave floor... to Glass unconscious on the ground. And above him on the wall, we see what he had been scratching... \n\"Robbed and left to die by Fitzgerald and Bridger. If find eether kill for Hugh Glass\" \nThe Arikara... unknowingly standing just above Glass... looking back to the tracks... scanning the water. But the surface is empty, and the river's too thick with mud to see anything below. \nBut they keep looking... and we're waiting for Glass to explode from the river, gasping for air. But he doesn't... and they keep scanning for what seems an eternity, until finally, the warriors turn... start walking back up the path. \nBehind them, Glass' face inches to the surface... pulls in some oxygen... watches as they fade into the trees. \nThen Glass rolls the rock away... starts moving deeper into the river... fighting the current to grab rocks and boulders... pulling himself to the other side. \nEXT. WILDERNESS - DAY \nGlass limps through the trees, still dripping with the muddy water of the Grand. \nEXT. WILDERNESS - LATER \nGlass is on his knees, desperately grabbing for a TINY FIELD MOUSE. The rodent escapes into a hole. Glass claws at the ground after it. He's starving to death. \nEXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT \nThe rain beating down through the trees. Glass huddles in a cluster of bushes, trying to stay dry... shivering in the cold. He reaches out from the cover, grabbing his moccasin boot standing in the rain. He pulls it in... slurps back the rainfall that it's caught. \nEXT. PRAIRIE - EVENING \nGlass limps slowly across the rolling prairie. He's weak... starving... isn't going to make it much further. He drops to his hands and knees. \nAnd then he feels something... the ground almost trembling under his hands. He watches his hands quiver with vibration. A RUMBLE BUILDS. Glass strains to hear... looks to the crest of a hill... labors up the gentle slope toward the sound. \nEXT. PRAIRIE/HILL - EVENING \nGlass reaches the crest... looks over the other side to a HERD OF BUFFALO THUNDERING ACROSS THE PRAIRIE. \nAn incredible site... hundreds of massive creatures... their hooves tearing up the earth, leaving a cloud of dust behind them. \nBehind the herd, a PACK OF WOLVES FIGHT OVER A FALLEN BUFFALO. \nGlass lies in the high grass, watching the wolves SNARL AND SNAP over the remains. And he eyes that buffalo... the closest he's been to food in days. \nEXT. PLAINS - NIGHT \nThe five wolves rest around the downed buffalo, their snouts bloody from the meal. Suddenly, one of the wolves' heads snaps up... bares its teeth... SNARLS. \nAnd then we see what the wolf is growling at... Glass... limping out of the shadows toward the animals, holding a BURNING SAGE BUSH IN EACH HAND... like giant FLAMING HANDS clawing in the night. \nThe wolves jump to their feet, unsure of what's approaching. They growl at Glass. But Glass keeps coming... doing his best to YELL... more like GROWL back at the wolves. He swings the flaming brush, tossing glowing sparks through the air. \nThe wolves spread out, instinctively surrounding Glass. But Glass singles out each one... charges, waving the flames... driving each wolf back. \nFour of the wolves back away, but the leader holds its ground... even moves toward Glass... only a few feet away... SNARLING... bloody jaws ready to attack, but still not sure what its up against. \nGlass shakes the flames at the wolf... it SNAPS AT GLASS' ARM. Glass swings the other... slams the fiery plant across the wolf's head. \nThe wolf YELPS... leaps back... starts to run away, but turns back... makes another charge at Glass. But Glass is ready... throws the flaming ball of sage at the wolf, then clubs it with the other. The animal's fur begins to burn. \nThe frightened wolf has had enough... rolls on the ground, then spins to join the rest of its pack. They run a safe distance, then stop... keeping a watch on Glass. \nGlass drags the burning sage bushes along the ground, igniting the grass and brush... creating a foot-high flaming wall between him and the wolves. \nHe stretches the flame into a circle, a fiery ring surrounds the fallen buffalo. \nThe wolves have seen enough... turn... race away from the flames. \nAs the grass around him burns, Glass drops the sage plants... attacks the buffalo remains, tearing away bloody chunks of flesh from the carcass, and shoving them into his mouth... a starving animal that's finally found food. \nEXT. PRAIRIE - NIGHT \nFrom high above the prairie... Glass and the buffalo at the center of that glowing ring of fire. \nEXT. PRAIRIE - DAY \nThe wind's gusting... bending the high golden grass over on its side. Glass moves slowly across, pulling his collar up to shield his face from the cold winds. He spots something in the distant sky ahead... a THIN LINE OF BLACK SMOKE. Glass picks up his pace... hope spurring him on. \nEXT. BURNED ARIKARA VILLAGE - DAY \nThe charred, skeletal remains of a tribe's village... just black posts where tee-pees once stood... a half-burned log lodge still smokes, sending that black line into the sky. \nBridger's head snaps to Fitzgerald... don't make this worse. \nFITZGERALD (CONT'D) So that's what we did. \nPig reaches up... gives Bridger a pat on the back. But to Bridger, it feels like a red-hot blade. \nHENRY Glad to hear you pulled your weight, Mr. Bridger. I knew you would. \nFITZGERALD More than his share, Captain. \nAnd now Fitzgerald has snared Bridger into his lie. Bridger drops his eyes to his feet. \nHENRY Speaking of shares. \nHenry turns to a SAFE resting against the wall. Fitzgerald watches as Henry spins the dial... locks in the combination, then pulls the latch. The safe door swings open... \n...revealing STACKS OF CASH. \nFitzgerald's eyes lock on all that money. Henry pulls out a handful... starts counting them out onto the desk. \nHENRY (CONT'D) Am I to assume the agreed arrangement didn't change? \nFITZGERALD Fortunate for me, it did not. \nHENRY Well thank you both for your courage and honor. You have done yourselves proud. \nFitzgerald swipes up his pile of bills. Henry drops a couple bills in front of Bridger. \nHENRY (CONT'D) You're owed something for what you did. \nBridger stares down at the bills a beat, then snatches them... pushes his way out of the office before he might have to look someone in the eye. \nFITZGERALD He's beat hisself up most of the trip... wishin' he'da done more. \nHENRY We all saw the shape Glass was in. There was no more to be done. \nFITZGERALD That's what I been tellin' him. \nINT. BUNKHOUSE - DAY \nEmpty, except for Bridger curled up on his cot, squeezing those crumpled bills in his hand, crying. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. TEE-PEE - DAY \nGlass sleeps under a buffalo robe. His eyes flicker open. \nCUT TO: \nGLASS' POV - ON THE BUFFALO AND DANCING FIGURE DESIGNS SHADOWED THROUGH THE TEE-PEE. \nGLASS - His hand reaching up to his throat. It looks much better than we last saw. And the stitches are gone from his face, now just long, pink scars. He stiffly raises himself up... remembers his back... struggles to reach behind him... scarred but clean... no maggots. \nHe looks beside him... sees BUCKSKIN PANTS AND SHIRT resting on the ground... waiting for him. \nEXT. TEE-PEE - DAY \nANGLE ON GLASS... dressed... pushing his way out through the flap of the tee-pee... limping out into the midday sun, and shielding his eyes. He looks like a man that hasn't seen the light of day for weeks. \nGlass adjusts to the brightness... stares in wonder at the scene. \nAnd then we see what Glass is looking at, and understand his reaction... the entire village is blanketed in snow. The Sioux VILLAGERS move about, wearing heavy skins and furs. \nA WOMEN'S O.S. VOICE turns Glass... \n...to WAKI, the woman from the images, walking toward him, bundled in fur. She says something else we can't understand... points to Glass' feet. Glass looks down... to his BARE FEET BURIED DEEP IN THE SNOW. He hadn't noticed. \nAnd then Waki smiles... a sweet, pretty smile. She takes his hand... leads him back into the tee-pee. \nINT. TEE-PEE - CONTINUOUS \nGlass and Waki enter. She pulls a pair of moccasins from a basket... hands them to Glass. \nSpotted Horse (cont'd) We trade Bra-zo. \nGlass stares at the tanning hides, then down at his leg. Finally, he nods. Spotted Horse starts walking... waves for Glass to follow. \nSpotted Horse (cont'd) Come. Eat. \nGlass follows after him. The children sneak in behind, giggling as they tail Glass across camp. \nGlass glances back... New Moon and Little One duck behind a tee-pee... wait for him to continue before they scoot back out after him. \nINT. CHIEF'S LODGE - NIGHT \nGlass, Spotted Horse, Three Feathers, Running Fox and OTHER WARRIORS sit around a fire, eating with CHIEF RED HAWK, the Medicine Man, and several other TRIBAL ELDERS. \nGLASS The men stole my rifle. \nThe Sioux don't understand. Glass reaches over, taking Spotted Horse's plate. \nGLASS (CONT'D) They took. They took... \nGlass aims an imaginary rifle. \nGLASS (CONT'D) ...my rifle. My gear. \nNow Spotted Horse understands... translates for the others. \nGLASS (CONT'D) They left me to die. So I mean to find `em both. Get my rifle back. \nSpotted Horse translates again. Red Hawk nods, studying Glass. \nRed Hawk SAYS SOMETHING to Glass... motions to the BEAR CLAW NECKLACE. Glass looks to Spotted Horse. \nSPOTTED HORSE Red Hawk ask who kill griz-lee. \nGlass touches his chest. Red Hawk nods, impressed. Glass points to the JAGGED SCARS running up Red Hawk's neck to a MISSING RIGHT EAR. \nGLASS Grizzly? \nRed Hawk smiles... shakes his head. \nRED HAWK Arikara. \nThat word, Glass understands. Red Hawk rambles a long sentence in Sioux. The other members LAUGH. \nSPOTTED HORSE He say Arikara take right ear of Sioux. Left ear of whites. Not know what they take from you. \nGlass smiles along with the others. They continue their meal. \nEXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - DAY \nSnow falls over Glass, as he stands outside the tee-pee, flexing his injured leg... putting more weight on it... testing its recovered strength. \nSuddenly, a SPEAR PLANTS INTO THE GROUND BETWEEN HIS FEET. Glass turns, startled... sees Spotted Horse, Three Feathers, Running Fox, and several OTHER WARRIORS staring at him. \nGlass' eyes jump from the spear to the warriors, unsure. \nSpotted Horse strides to Glass... grabs the spear, then spins it sideways... stares at Glass, until a smile spreads across Spotted Horse's face... he holds the spear out to Glass. \nSPOTTED HORSE Buff-A-lo Man hunt with Sioux? \nGlass relaxes... nods... takes the spear from Spotted Horse. Three Feathers hands a BUFFALO HIDE to Glass... motions for Glass to put it on. \nTHREE FEATHERS Tatanka Wicasa. \nGlass wraps the hide around him. The Warriors smile and nod. \nEXT. FOREST - DAY \nA world of silent white... like we're inside a giant snow- globe. The sky is emptying all the snow it has over us... pouring down... the only sound comes from the flakes hitting the already fallen snow. The pale trunks of Cottonwoods rise up from the white ground. \nThen out of the white... a SHAPE APPEARS... a GIANT WOLF WALKING ON ITS HIND LEGS. But as the wolf comes closer, we see it's not a wolf at all... it's THREE FEATHERS, wearing his WOLF SKIN. He CRIES OUT... HOWLING WILDLY. \nA few yards beside him, another WARRIOR is doing the same... CHANTING... beating his spear against the Cottonwoods as he walks. \nSpotted Horse (O.S.) Bra-zo. \nGlass turns to Spotted Horse, pointing to the hides. Glass nods... looks back to the last of the hides being pulled down... doesn't seem as excited as he once might have been. \nEXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - LATER \nSpotted Horse and Three Feathers sit atop their horses. Three Feathers holds the reins to another horse packed with hides. An empty horse stands beside them... waiting for Glass. \nGlass is leaning over to New Moon and Little One... handing them the CRUDE BUFFALO CARVING he made from the wood. \nGLASS (taps his chest) Tatanka Wicasa. \nThe little boys smile. Glass nods to Waki, then waves to Red Hawk and the Medicine Man. They return it... watch Glass climb onto his horse. \nGlass, Spotted Horse and Three Feathers ride out of the village. \nEXT. WILDERNESS - DAY \nGlass, Spotted Horse and Three Feathers ride along a high ridge, surrounded by empty snow-covered wilderness. They have the world to themselves. \nEXT. CAMP - NIGHT \nGlass crouches over a shallow, five-foot long hole surrounded by deep snow. The hole is filled with small fires and rocks. And he's watching Spotted Horse and Three Feathers tossing rocks into their own matching holes, then dragging the dirt back into them. Spotted Horse throws a glance back to Glass, making sure he understands. \nGlass nods... pulls the dirt back in, covering the flames. He watches Spotted Horse spread a blanket over the warm ground, then does the same. He sits on the mound of dirt... leans back against a tree... feels the warmth rise up from beneath him. \nHe nods to Spotted Horse, who is already resting under his blanket. \nGLASS Nice. \nSPOTTED HORSE (NODS) Nice. \nGlass pulls the buffalo hide around himself... keeping watch. \nSPOTTED HORSE (cont'd) Sleep. No Arikara. \nGlass nods... but still doesn't close his eyes. Spotted Horse tosses his knife over beside Glass. Glass takes it... nods to Spotted Horse. \nSPOTTED HORSE (cont'd) Me sleep. \nSpotted Horse rolls over, turning his back on Glass... trusting him with the knife. Three Feathers does the same. \nGlass just stares out into the night. \nINT. FORT UNION/BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT \nDark and quiet... except for the SNORING of a few men. Fitzgerald sleeps on his cot. A shadow glides across him... hovers over his face. \nFitzgerald's eyes blink open. \nCUT TO: \nFITZGERALD'S POV... \n...on GLASS STANDING OVER HIM... his scarred face calm and deadly... raising a knife to drive down into Fitzgerald's chest. \nFITZGERALD No... please. \nBut Glass swings the blade. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. WILDERNESS - MORNING \nAnd Spotted Horse shaking Glass awake from his dream. Glass' hand flies up, the knife gripped. But Spotted Horse grabs his arm... stops it in mid-swing... holds it until Glass realizes it was a dream... relaxes. \nSPOTTED HORSE We go. \nGlass calms... nods. \nEXT. FORT BRAZEAU - DAY \nJust a small cluster of log buildings sitting along the banks of the Missouri. Dozens of tee-pees and tents are set up outside the complex. \nSpotted Horse stares at Glass a long beat, then... \nSPOTTED HORSE You spend your life hunting enemy. Enemy wins. \nGLASS It will be over soon. \nThen Glass pulls the Bear Claw Necklace off... hands it to Spotted Horse. Spotted Horse holds it... then proudly slides it over his head. \nGLASS (CONT'D) (IN SIOUX) Thank you. \nSpotted Horse raises his hand in goodbye, then spins his horse and starts away. Three Feathers does the same. Glass returns it... watches them ride off. \nEXT. FORT BRAZEAU - NIGHT \nGlass is in the trees beyond the tents and tee-pees... crouched on the ground... dragging the dirt back over the fire and rocks. He slides up onto the mound... feels the warmth, and smiles... just a little. \nEXT. MISSOURI RIVER - MORNING \nGlass rides a PAINT MARE along a ridge overlooking the river. Fort Brazeau stands in the distance behind him. \nEXT. OPEN COUNTRY - DAY \nSnowy and cold. Glass leads the line of riders through the snow. \nEXT. FORT UNION - EVENING \nBut you can't tell if it's day or night through the blizzard. Fitzgerald, Pig, Anderson, Bridger, Murphy and Stubby Joe trudge through the snow in their snowshoes... finally reach the bunkhouse. \nINT. BUNKHOUSE - EVENING \nAnderson shoves the door closed against the wind... latches it. The men look worn and battered... wind-burnt faces, icicles in their beards. \nFITZGERALD I had enough of this cold as hell shit. \nANDERSON What'd you figure when ya signed on outta that St. Louis whorehouse you was workin'? That you was headin' off to paradise? \nPig snorts a laugh at Fitzgerald's expense. \nFITZGERALD I tell ya what I figured, I figured I'd be somewhere the piss wouldn't freeze before I got it outta my pecker. \nBRIDGER Figured wrong. \nFitzgerald throws Bridger a glare... wants to throw more, but Bridger's returning the stare... hard... so Fitzgerald decides he'd better not push it. \nFITZGERALD Waste a time to check traps in this weather... while Henry sits warmin' his ass on the stove in his office. \nSTUBBY BILL Why don't you go tell him that, Fitz? Then start your hike back to St. Louie. \nFITZGERALD Shit, I walked up here, I got no problem walkin' back. \nMURPHY Contracted for twelve months. We all did. \nFITZGERALD Henry can shove that contract up his toasty warm ass, or I'll do it for him. \nThe others laugh at Fitzgerald's rambling. \nFITZGERALD (CONT'D) You don't think I will? \nThe men shake their heads. Fitzgerald grabs his gloves... starts strapping his snowshoes back on. \nANDERSON Just give that fat little whore you're so sweet on a couple extra bits... she'll have you thinkin' it's Spring already. \nThe men laugh as Fitzgerald walks out... leaves the door wide open for the cold wind to pour over the others. Pig scurries over, shoving it closed. \nAs the other men gather around a table to play cards, Bridger pulls a JOURNAL from under his cot... falls onto the cot, and starts writing. \nINT. ROCKY MOUNTAIN FUR COMPANY OFFICE - EVENING \nFitzgerald enters... looks around the empty office. \nFITZGERALD Hello? Captain? \nThe place is empty. Fitzgerald eyes Henry's desk... then past his desk... to the SAFE... its door CRACKED OPEN... STACKS OF MONEY visible inside. \nGlass takes off through the forest. \nEXT. FOREST - NIGHT \nGlass hanging onto the paint mare, as she gallops through the trees... the animal's nostrils spread wide, pulling in all the oxygen it can. \nGlass glances back... sees SHAPES BEHIND HIM... HORSES... ridden by Elk's Tongue and eight other warriors. \nGlass digs his heels into the horse, squeezing every ounce of speed from her legs... pushing her toward the clearing up ahead... throwing another glance back... then looking in front of him, and realizing it isn't a clearing at all... \n...it's the edge of the world. \nThe paint mare explodes from the trees, then runs out of ground... because she's just galloped off the side of a cliff. \nThe horse sails downward toward a thick forest of trees, its legs flailing for something to stand on. \nGlass drops the rifle to grip the horse's mane, hanging on for what seems an endless fall. \nThe mare SLAMS LEG-FIRST INTO THE TREE-TOPS with Glass still on her back. The Paint Mare SQUEALS as she drops into the snow-covered trees, carrying Glass with her. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FOREST - CONTINUOUS \nAnd the horse comes crashing through the branches... the massive limbs slowing her fall... snapping off as her body hits and twists... tosses Glass away. \nThe Paint Mare continues her deadly descent, the trees tearing at her body... catching her head... SNAPPING her neck. \nGlass slams off a branch... tumbles to the ground with a thud. The Paint Mare hits the snow beside him... very dead. \nGlass struggles to breath... finally GASPS... sucks in the oxygen. He lays there a moment... stares up through the trees... \n...to Elk's Tongue and the others staring down from the top of the cliff... with no way to get to Glass. \nGlass rises to his knees... glances around for his rifle... lost. He flinches with what must be broken ribs... drags himself up, and staggers to the horse... pulls his knife and cuts the snowshoes from the back of the saddle. \nHe throws the snowshoes over his shoulder... continues on, through the woods... alone... in the middle of nowhere... again. \nEXT. OPEN COUNTRY - DAY \nFrom high above... the small shape of Glass making his way over the snowy ground... heading toward TWO DISTANT SHACKS. \nEXT. FORT TALBOT - DAY \nA makeshift town on the banks of the Missouri. Two ramshackle structures... the General Store and a tattered livery stable filled with horses. \nINT. FORT TALBOT/GENERAL STORE - DAY \nMore like a saloon that sells a few supplies. A gang of TRAPPERS drink and play cards. A RUNTY MAN stands behind the counter, watching them... \n...until the door blows open, and in steps Glass. He pulls the fur hat away from his face, and what a sight he is... scarred face stiff from the cold... ice frozen in his beard. \nThe room falls silent... everyone staring at Glass. Until TRAPPER #1 snorts a laugh. Glass limps to the counter. All eyes follow him. \nGLASS (struggling to make his frozen lips move) I'm Hugh Glass of... \nRUNTY MAN We don't serve niggers. \nGlass stares at the Runty Man a beat, then... \nGLASS Of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company on my way to Fort Union. \nRUNTY MAN I don't care if you was with Lewis and Clark headed for the new world. We don't serve niggers. \nGLASS All I need is a horse and enough supplies to... \nTRAPPER Ice musta froze up his ears, `cause he ain't listenin' to you, Cees. \nGLASS ...to get me to Fort Union. I can sign a draft made good by Captain Henry. \nThe Runty Man just stares at Glass... grins a TOOTHLESS GRIN. \nRUNTY MAN What the fuck happened to your face, boy? You try to slice all the black off? \nSTUBBY BILL'S POV... \n...on the blanket of fog hanging in the air... that same CRUNCHING, as a SHADOW APPEARS... growing clearer... a FIGURE walking... leading a horse behind him... appearing out of the mist like a ghost... GLASS. \nSTUBBY BILL - STARES DOWN IN SHOCK... \n...sure his eyes are betraying him. But then Glass looks straight up at Stubby Bill, and there's no doubt. \nSTUBBY BILL Jesus Christ. \nINT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT \nDark and quiet... just Pig's snoring rattling the silence. Suddenly the door kicks open... SLAMS into the wall... and there's GLASS' SILHOUETTE FILLING THE DOORWAY. \nGROANS from the awakened men... hands moving through the dark for oil lamps... turning them bright... until the room's fully lit... and they all see Glass standing there... eyes floating across the room, searching for a target. \nThe men just stare back at him, like they're all part of the same dream. \nExcept for Bridger, who's propped up in his cot like he's been waiting all night... waiting every night... for Glass to appear in that doorway. \nBRIDGER I'm sorry. \nGlass raises the stolen pistol... aims it at Bridger. And the young man doesn't flinch... almost as if he wants to make sure Glass doesn't miss. \nThe other men just watch in silence, not sure what the hell's going on. \nGlass holds his aim on Bridger's face... a face that's haunted him... kept him alive. \nGLASS You took everything I had... left me to die. \nGlass walks toward Bridger, the gun still raised... each step of his feet on the wood floor is like the thud of an executioner's drum. \nMUMBLING from the other men, as they watch this ghost reach Bridger... stand over him, the pistol aimed down. \nGLASS (CONT'D) Why? \nBRIDGER I was scared of dyin'. (BEAT) But every day since, I've wished I had. \nGlass' finger tightens on the trigger, ready to make Bridger's wish come true. \nThe rest of the bunkhouse watches this execution in wide- eyed, stone silence, afraid to move. \nGLASS There wasn't no `Ree that night, was there? \nA long beat, then... \nBRIDGER No. \nGlass PISTOL WHIPS BRIDGER, knocking him to the floor. And before Bridger can crawl away, Glass in over him... those aching, frozen fists beating mercilessly down on Bridger. \nAnd Bridger doesn't fight back... just does his best to cover up, but the blows keep coming, and Bridger's face is covered in blood... \n...just as Henry runs inside, half-dressed from where Stubby Bill awoke him. Henry grabs Glass... pulls him off. \nGlass spins... jams his pistol right in Henry's face. \nHENRY Hugh. Wait. \nGlass is crazy with rage... barely stops himself from pulling that trigger. But finally, he calms... his arm sinks, lowering his aim. He glances around the bunkhouse. \nGLASS Where's Fitzgerald and my rifle? \nHENRY Deserted two days ago. Along with about five hundred dollars of company money. (BEAT) Let's get some coffee to warm you up. (to Glass, but looking at BRIDGER) I wanna hear what happened. \nGlass looks back to Bridger... they hold a long stare, until Glass walks out. \nBRIDGER Wait. Please! \nBut Glass and Henry disappear, leaving Bridger alone with all those eyes burning into him. Bridger looks to Pig, but Pig just lowers his eyes... can't even look at the boy. \nThe men step into their boots and furs... file out after Glass and Henry... leaving Bridger alone in the bunkhouse. \nINT. ROCKY MOUNTAIN FUR COMPANY OFFICE - NIGHT \nSTUBBY BILL (cont'd) Just left this on his bunk. \nHenry takes the journal... flips it open. \nHENRY (READING) \"Every day I think about what I done. I want to tell Pig and the others the truth but am afraid what they'll think of me. I look at Fitzgerald and want to kill him but am afraid to try. I am a coward and wish he hadn't been lyin about the Ree that night. I wish they had come and kilt us both.\" \nGlass considers the words a beat, then swings onto his horse. \nGLASS If I run across the boy, I'll send him back your way. \nGlass sees Henry on horseback, trotting toward them. \nGLASS (CONT'D) Where're you headed? \nHENRY Fitzgerald stole five hundred dollars. Rocky Mountain Fur Company wants him too. \nGLASS I can do this on my own. \nHENRY I know you can. But maybe you won't have to. \nGlass stares at Henry a beat, then finally just pulls his horse around... heads for the river. Henry nods to Pig and Murphy as he follows after Glass. \nEXT. ROCK LEDGE - DAY \nFrom above Fort Union. Our POV on Glass and Henry riding south along the icy river. \nAnd then we see our POV is Bridger's... standing along the ledge, loaded with all his gear. He watches the riders another moment, then turns... hikes the opposite direction... leaving Fort Union behind forever. \nEXT. FORT TALBOT/GENERAL STORE - DAY \nThe Runty Man behind the counter. A few of the same Trappers drinking... playing cards. Just another day at Fort Talbot. \nThe door swings open, and a FUR-COVERED FIGURE enters. \nRUNTY MAN We ain't got no food to spare, friend, if that's what you're lookin' for. \nThe figure pulls back his furs, and we see it's Fitzgerald... cold and miserable. \nFITZGERALD Then what the hell have ya got? \nRUNTY MAN Whiskey and blankets mostly. Weather's held back deliveries. \nFitzgerald throws a glance to the Trappers. \nFITZGERALD Gimme a couple bottles then. Goddamn ice shredded my boat. Been walkin' for two days. \nThe Runty Man hands Fitzgerald the bottles. Fitzgerald pops one... gulps some down. \nFITZGERALD (CONT'D) How much for one of them horses out there? \nRUNTY MAN Horses ain't cheap this time a year. \nFITZGERALD Whatever the price, Rocky Mountain Fur Company's good for it. \nAnd those words stop everything. The Trappers all turn from their game. The Runty Man glares at Fitzgerald. \nRUNTY MAN You're the second son of a bitch come in here makin' that claim. And the first one left a bad taste. \nFITZGERALD That right? Well I don't know nothin' about that. Just that I need a horse. \nRUNTY MAN So did this other fella. So he stole one... along with Lange's pistola. \nTrapper #1 nods to Fitzgerald. \nFITZGERALD Fine then, I'll pay cash for the horse. How much? \nRUNTY MAN How `bout you pay for your friend's too. \nTRAPPER #1 And my shooter. \nFITZGERALD Wasn't my friend. \nTrapper #1 stands up. \nHENRY This was Fitzgerald camped here? \nGLASS Couple nights back. But these tracks aren't all his. \nHENRY He's travelin' with somebody? \nGLASS (shakes his head) Came in after. Prints are smooth. Mocassins. \nHenry throws Glass a look... he knows what that means. \nGLASS (CONT'D) Could be Sioux... Blackfoot even. \nHENRY But you figure they're `Ree. \nGLASS I don't figure nothin', Captain. But whoever it is, they're a good day behind Fitzgerald. \nGlass walks, leading his horse, as he follows the tracks away from camp. Henry rides after him. \nGLASS (CONT'D) And they're on his trail too, so we should keep it quiet... don't announce we're back here. \nHENRY You told me once you knew enough to keep away from the `Ree. \nGLASS I do. \nHENRY You figure this is smart then? \nGlass swings up onto his horse. \nGLASS You're welcome to head back, Captain. \nGlass trots off. Henry watches him a beat, then throws a glance into the trees... follows after Glass. \nEXT. WILDERNESS/CAMP - NIGHT \nGlass kneels on the ground, building a fire-bed... dragging the dirt over the fire and rocks. Henry's under a blanket, watching him. \nHENRY What if we find Fitzgerald... and I ask you not to do this? \nGlass spreads a blanket over the ground. \nGLASS Don't ask me. \nGlass settles in on the warm earth. Henry just keeps watching him. \nEXT. WILDERNESS/CAMP - LATER \nANGLE ON HENRY... \n...asleep under the blanket. O.S. RUSTLING sends his eyes flashing open. He raises up... rifle ready. \nHe glances at Glass, who puts a finger over his lips. \nHENRY (WHISPERS) `Ree? \nGlass doesn't answer... just keeps searching the brush. \nHenry's groggy eyes dart around the night... spots MOVEMENT IN THE BRUSH. \nHENRY (CONT'D) There! \nGLASS Wait! \nBut it's too late... Henry fires... BOOM... the shot explodes through the night... \n...and the DEER leaps away. \nHenry looks to Glass... shakes his head... sorry. \nHENRY So much for stayin' quiet. \nCUT TO: \nFITZGERALD - SQUATTING BESIDE A SMALL FIRE... \nEXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT \nGlass charges from the forest... spots Henry's horse standing in the trees... tears through the snow toward it... leaps off the still-moving animal in a fluid slide... hits the ground with his rifle ready... \n...and sees HENRY'S BODY face-up in the snow. \nGlass drops to a knee... scans the darkness, as he slides over to Henry... \n...and we see he's a bloody mess... a GUNSHOT WOUND in his chest leaking out onto the snow... HIS HEAD SCALPED... LEFT EAR SLICED OFF. \nGlass stands back up, turning in a circle, as he peers into the distance around him. But there's nothing out there. Glass SCREAMS in rage. \nHe turns back to Henry... crouches down over him. \nGLASS You shouldn't a come. \nAs Glass looks at Henry, he notices something... takes Henry by the chin, and tilts his head. And HENRY'S RIGHT EAR HAS BEEN CUT OFF AS WELL. \nGlass stares at Henry a beat, then squints out into the forest. \nGLASS (CONT'D) (repeating Spotted Horse's words under his breath) Arikara take right ear of Sioux. Left ear of whites. Not know what they take from you. \nEXT. WILDERNESS/CLEARING - NIGHT \nGlass on horseback, leading Henry's horse behind him across the snow-covered meadow. Henry's fur-covered body is draped over the saddle. \nEXT. FROZEN RIVER - NIGHT \nA thick layer of ice covers the narrow river, thinning just a bit at the center. Glass kneels near the middle, chopping at the thick ice to get to the water beneath. He makes a hole... dips his canteen down into it, glancing around into the darkness. \nThen Glass turns... stares up a slope into the dark forest beyond... like he knows what's waiting for him there. \nHe walks to the horses, tied in the trees at the base of the slope... Henry still laying across the saddle of his horse in his bloody furs. \nGlass SNAPS A BRANCH FROM A FALLEN TREE... looks back up that slope. \nEXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT \nOUR POV FROM DEEP IN THE FOREST... \n...watching from the shadowy brush, as Glass appears up over the distant slope... riding through the trees, with Henry draped over the horse behind. \nThe forest is quiet... just the CRACKING of crusty snow and branches under the horses' hooves. \nThen BOOM... as the ANSTADT BARREL WE HADN'T SEEN BESIDE US FLASHES IN THE NIGHT... \n...and Glass tumbles off his horse. \nThe horses prance around with a start, then settle... and then FITZGERALD RISES FROM THE BRUSH BESIDE US... eases toward the horses, reloading the Anstadt as he moves. \nHe reaches Glass, face down in the snow... his furs covering him. \nAnd Fitzgerald has that rifle aimed, ready for Glass to suddenly roll over firing... \n...but Glass doesn't move. Fitzgerald nudges him with his boot, then crouches down... grabs Glass by the shoulder, and pulls him over... \n...and there's HENRY'S LIFELESS FACE HIDDEN BENEATH THE FURS... and that BROKEN BRANCH sticking up along his back. \nANGLE FROM BEHIND HENRY'S HORSE... \n...on the REST OF THE BRANCH RIGGED TO GLASS' SADDLE to hold Henry upright... \n...and then what we thought was Henry flung over the second horse... MOVING... the bloody fur-covered arm lifting a rifle... the head raising up... it's GLASS... taking aim... \n...as Fitzgerald realizes what's happened... spins with the Anstadt... \n...to Glass laying across the horse... rifle dead set on Fitzgerald... BOOM... BOOM... both rifles explode... \n...Fitzgerald goes flying backward into the brush. \nFitzgerald's wild shot hits Henry's horse, sending it rearing up, tossing Glass to the ground. \nBut Glass is on his feet in a flash... reloading as he charges into the brush... \n", "test1_input": "Henry shoves a TRAPPER toward the water. An arrow drives into the trapper's leg... he goes down. Henry lifts the man to pull him into the river, but several more arrows bury in the man's back... he falls limp. Henry FIRES HIS PISTOLS, dropping the WARRIOR. \nBridger and Pig join Glass... splash into the river, SHOOTING back at the attacking Arikara. The water deepens, and they start swimming toward the flatboat. \nARROWS HISS into the water all around them. \nGlass is still in the shallows... aims his pistol... BAM... shoots an oncoming warrior... spins after the other men... joins them as they near the flatboat. \nA final TRAPPER charges down the shore behind them. SEVERAL WARRIORS pursue him. \nTRAPPER WAIT! \nHe aims his pistol over his shoulder as he runs... pulls the trigger... CLICK... pulls it again... CLICK. But he's too scared to stop his finger... CLICK... CLICK... CLICK... THUD... as a hatchet buries in his back. He crashes face first into the shallows. \nThe Arikara leader, (ELK'S TONGUE), animal bones braided into his mohawk, a NECKLACE OF HUMAN EARS around his neck, straddles the dying man. Elk's Tongue grabs the Trapper by the hair, and CUTS OFF HIS LEFT EAR, then holds it up to Glass and the others, as he SCREAMS HIS WAR CRY. \nGlass and the men shove the flatboat off the sandbar... start scrambling aboard, as arrows dart past them... drive into the wooden boat. \nSuddenly a WARRIOR EXPLODES FROM THE WATER... tackles Bridger as he climbs up the side of the flatboat... jerks him back into the river. Bridger flails in the water... watches the warrior raise his hatchet high to slam down... just as Glass SLAMS THE BUTT OF HIS ANSTADT into the back of the Warrior's head. \nThe Warrior collapses under the surface. Glass grabs Bridger's hand... drags him up onto the deck. \nBRIDGER Thank you. \nBut Glass is already gone... FIRING BACK AT THE ARIKARA, as the current carries them away. \nVOICE (O.S.) HEY! \nPig looks over the side... sees a frantic WILLIAM ANDERSON gripped to the edge. Pig pulls him onto the boat. \nFitzgerald and Glass grab LONGPOLES... shove them against the river's bottom to pick up speed. \nHenry stands on deck, watching as Elk's Tongue yanks a DYING TRAPPER's head back by his hair to peel away his scalp. \nHenry drops his eyes... can't watch. The TRAPPER'S SCREAM ECHOES OVER HIM. \nEXT. MISSOURI RIVER/FLATBOAT - LATER \nQuiet and dark... the battle long over. The flatboat floats with the gentle current. The NINE SURVIVING TRAPPERS are scattered around the deck... Glass digging an arrow out of WALLACE MURPHY'S SHOULDER... Fitzgerald poling on one side with Anderson on the other... STUBBY BILL VANCE and Pig standing patrol with their rifles... Bridger doctoring a badly WOUNDED TRAPPER... and Henry standing at the front of the flatboat, staring off blankly. \nFITZGERALD What's the plan, Captain? \nHenry's still lost in those screams. \nFITZGERALD (CONT'D) Captain! What the hell do we do now? \nHenry snaps out of his stare... turns to the men... obviously doesn't have an answer. \nANDERSON We're just floatin' farther from Fort Union. \nHenry's eyes instinctively look to Glass. \nGLASS The Missouri's no good. Not if the `Ree's running it. \nFITZGERALD So we just float the hell down to Mexico or wherever else this river takes us? \nGLASS We get ourselves safe outta range, then track another course up. \nFITZGERALD Add weeks to the trip. \nBRIDGER Better that than endin' up scalped on the side of the river. \nFITZGERALD (shoving him away) Shut up, kid, you don't get no say in this. \nBridger starts to respond, but Fitzgerald's angry glare stops him. \nFITZGERALD (CONT'D) (back to Henry) And in case you hadn't noticed, Captain, we're twelve men short of what we were. (off the badly wounded TRAPPER) Thirteen before long. \nHENRY I understand our situation, Mr. Fitzgerald. We do like Glass said... put some distance between us and the Arikara, then chart a course to Fort Union. \nFitzgerald MUMBLES UNDER HIS BREATH... rolls those dark eyes to Anderson. Glass gives Henry a nod. \nEXT. MISSOURI RIVER/FLATBOAT - NIGHT \n", "test1_true": "...as hands push the body over the side of the boat. It splashes into the water... floats downstream. \nWe PULL BACK... see that the flatboat is beached along the bank of the river. Glass and Pig watch the body drift away. \nPIG Reckon it's better `an lettin' the `Ree find him... take his ears... slice what's left all to shit. \nGlass nods... steps down off the boat to Henry and the others. They're gathered around a map spread out on the ground. Henry runs his finger along a THIN BLUE LINE. \nHENRY So we hike west to the Grand, then follow it up to Fort Union. \nFITZGERALD On foot? You got any idea how long that's gonna take? It'll be winter before we get there. \nANDERSON Unless we come across a post... trade for some horses. \nGLASS No posts that far out. \nFITZGERALD So if we do this, we do every step with our own feet. \nHENRY We make camp here for the night, then load supplies and head out for the Grand at first light. (BEAT) And gather extra blankets `cause there won't be any fires. \nMore GRUMBLING from Fitzgerald and Anderson, as they move toward the cover of trees. Bridger walks up beside Glass. \nBRIDGER Thank you... for what you done back there. \nGLASS You'd have done the same for me. \nBridger nods... he hopes so. \nEXT. WOODS - NIGHT \nPig on watch... sitting at the base of a tree, rifle across his lap, eyes wide, scanning the darkness. All clear. He peers back to camp... Fitzgerald, Anderson, Stubby Bill, and Murphy wrapped in blankets... passing a bottle of whiskey around. Bridger across from Fitzgerald, poking at the dirt with a stick. Henry is off to one side, still studying that map. Glass sits against a tree, cleaning his Anstadt rifle. \nFitzgerald watches Glass a beat, then... \nFITZGERALD You treat that Anstadt sweeter than any woman, Glass. \nSTUBBY BILL Never seen a woman that could stop a `Ree from three hundred feet. \nANDERSON I knew a particular big-breasted redhead in Boston that might come close. \nThe others manage a small laugh. Glass just keeps working on that rifle. \nFITZGERALD Bring it over here for me to have a look. \nGlass doesn't look up... wipes a rag down the barrel. \nFITZGERALD (CONT'D) Did you hear what I said, boy? \nStill nothing from Glass. And Fitzgerald doesn't like that... the tension's growing. \nBRIDGER (MUMBLING) You seen it before. \nFitzgerald turns that mean, drunken glare on Bridger. \nFITZGERALD What'd you say, kid? \nBridger hesitates a beat... until the other men's eyes force a response. \nBRIDGER (SOFTLY) I said you shoulda already got a look when he saved you with it earlier. \nThe camp falls still... nobody talks to Fitzgerald like that... especially when he's drunk. There isn't a sound except for Glass working methodically on his rifle... \n...until the SWISH OF BLADE OVER LEATHER, as Fitzgerald tears the blade from his belt... flings it into the dirt between Bridger's legs... AN INCH BELOW HIS CROTCH. \nFitzgerald stares at Bridger, daring him to react. But Bridger's too scared... doesn't, so Fitzgerald just smiles. \nFITZGERALD You're lucky you ain't a man yet. (off the blade) Else that mighta nicked somethin'. \nA few NERVOUS CHUCKLES from the others, hoping this is over. And it is, because Fitzgerald reaches over and pulls the knife away... cleans the dirty blade on Bridger's leg. \nFITZGERALD (CONT'D) And unlike you, I don't need savin' by him or nobody else. Remember that. \nFitzgerald stands... wobbles just a bit. He slides the knife back into his belt, then steadies his drunken gaze on Glass. \n", "test2_input": "Fitzgerald shoves him away... Bridger stumbles and falls. Fitzgerald tosses the bloody rag at him. \nFITZGERALD (CONT'D) And I was just doin' your job... cleanin' him up. \nFitzgerald grabs Glass' Anstadt, almost daring Bridger to say something. Of course Bridger doesn't. Fitzgerald walks toward the trees. \nFITZGERALD (CONT'D) Why don't ya pour some more broth down his throat... keep him alive another week so we can fall farther back. End up walkin' all the way to Fort Union on our own. `Ree would love to poach on just two. (turns to Bridger) I promise ya, you'll look a helluva lot worse than Glass when they're done with you. \nBridger watches him disappear into the trees... wipes the blood from his lip with a trembling hand. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT \nFrom high above the trees. The world is silent... peaceful... until SEVERAL STARTLED CROWS shoot up from the treetops. \nCUT TO: \nBLACK... \n...the sound of FRENZIED BREATHING. \nFITZGERALD (V.O.) (PANICKED WHISPER) Bridger! Get your ass up! \nDim light fills the frame... then FITZGERALD'S FACE right in front of us. \nFITZGERALD (CONT'D) `Ree. \nBRIDGER - SCRAMBLES UP FROM UNDER HIS BLANKET, WIPING THE SLEEP FROM HIS FRIGHTENED EYES. \nBRIDGER What? \nFITZGERALD Keep quiet. I was down at the creek... there's twenty of `em at least, comin' this way. \nBRIDGER Oh, shit. Whatta we do? \nFITZGERALD We run. Now. \nAnd Fitzgerald's just whispering, but it's with such power that Bridger has no response... watches as Fitzgerald gathers his bag, starts throwing in food and supplies. Bridger is scared out of his mind... does the same... grabs for his rifle, resting near Glass. \nBridger freezes... in his panic, he'd forgotten all about Glass. And now the wounded man's eyes stare up at him... understanding perfectly what's happening around him. \nBRIDGER What about Glass? \nFITZGERALD He's on his own, same as us. \nBRIDGER I can't leave him. \nFITZGERALD Then I'm talkin' to a dead man. \nGlass gives Bridger the slightest of nods... go. But Bridger's frozen... doesn't know what to do... until Fitzgerald shoves him back to life. \nFITZGERALD (CONT'D) Move. \nGlass reaches out a weak hand out for his Anstadt... clawing for his weapon. Bridger starts to hand it to Glass, but Fitzgerald grabs it first. \nBRIDGER What're you doin'? He needs that. \nFITZGERALD He couldn't hold it if you tarred it to his hands. \nGlass strains to hold out his trembling hand for his gun. \nBRIDGER It's his goddamn rifle! That's all he's got! \nFITZGERALD And more than he'll need. \nFitzgerald scoops up Glass' knife as well. \nBRIDGER We can't leave him with nothin'. \nBut Fitzgerald is already sprinting away... disappearing into the trees. Glass stares after him, his once-calm eyes suddenly filled with a rage. And Bridger's frozen again, lost between duty and fear... until finally, he just shakes his head and takes off into the trees. \nGlass's empty hand falls back to the ground... he tries to yell out in anger, but his throat EXPLODES IN PAIN. His hand digs into the dirt... pulls him over onto his side. He flops over to his stomach... GASPS IN PAIN... then using his one good arm, drags himself over the dirt, his healthy leg pushing weakly at the ground, trying to propel him forward... a futile chase after Fitzgerald and Bridger... \n", "test2_true": "Then he spots that hole... the grave Fitzgerald dug for him. He grunts into action... grabs SEVERAL, THIN BROKEN BRANCHES from the ground, then claws forward, each movement excruciating... until finally, he reaches the hole, and ROLLS INTO IT... lands with a PAINFUL CRUNCH. \nHe rests there a moment, trying to regain any ounce of strength. Finally he fights through the pain... shoves the branches back up... spreading them across the hole as camouflage... a thin veil, but all that Glass has. \nHe lies there defenseless... INSIDE HIS OWN GRAVE. Hiding... listening for the Arikara's arrival... waiting to die. \nCUT TO: \nGLASS' POV - OUT OF THE GRAVE... TIGHT AND CLAUSTROPHOBIC... JUST THE NIGHT SKY THROUGH THOSE BRANCHES... AND THE SOUND OF HIS PAINFUL BREATHS. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. WILDERNESS - MORNING \nCold and grey. Fitzgerald crouches beside a small fire, warming his hands. WHISPS OF SMOKE rise into the sky. \nFITZGERALD We ran the better part of six hours. Had to gain some ground on Henry and them others. \nBridger sits at the base of a tree, not listening... staring... his mind replaying the desertion of Glass over and over. He notices the smoke. \nBRIDGER Best douse that smoke before them `Ree spot it. \nFITZGERALD We put enough distance between us and them. And it's too damn cold to go without one. \nBRIDGER All we know, they hoofed it through the night same as us. \nFITZGERALD (shakes his head) A dozen `Ree can't make the time us two did. \nBridger looks back to the trees... then considers something, stares at Fitzgerald a beat, before... \nBRIDGER It was twenty earlier. \nFITZGERALD What? \nBRIDGER When you woke me... you said you'd spotted twenty `Ree. \nFITZGERALD A dozen... twenty. I wasn't in a mood to count feathers. Hell, one `Ree woulda been too many. \nFitzgerald empties his canteen over the fire, killing the flames. Bridger stares at the water pouring out. \nBRIDGER What was you even doin' down at the creak in the middle of the night? (BEAT) I'd already brought plenty a water. \nFitzgerald doesn't answer. Bridger tightens his grip on his rifle... slowly rises. \nBRIDGER (CONT'D) Answer me. \nFITZGERALD Don't start questionin' me on accounta you feelin' guilty `bout leavin' your nigger buddy behind. \nBridger musters up all the courage he can... aims his rifle at Fitzgerald. \nBRIDGER ANSWER ME OR I BLOW YOUR DAMN HEAD OFF! \nFitzgerald stares back at Bridger and his rifle... eyes taking in everything... a snake sizing up its prey. Then Fitzgerald stands... takes a step toward the boy. \nFITZGERALD What're you askin'? Why it was you turned your back on Glass? Why you let him die to save your own sorry skin? (BEAT) `Cause you was scared shitless, that's why. \nBRIDGER The `Ree... did you see `em? (off Fitzgerald's silence) DID YOU SEE `EM? \nFITZGERALD (MOVING CLOSER) Not a one. \nBridger CRIES OUT... starts to pull the trigger, when Fitzgerald's hand flashes out, grabbing the barrel, and shoving the butt back into Bridger's face... THWACK. \nThe force of the blow knocks Bridger back to the ground, but Fitzgerald holds his grip on the rifle barrel... flips it around to aim it at the boy. Blood drips down Bridger's head as he stares up at his rifle pointed down. \nFitzgerald's finger tightens on the trigger. \nFITZGERALD (CONT'D) So that there is the answer to your question. \nAnd Fitzgerald PULLS THE TRIGGER... AND BRIDGER SQUEEZES HIS EYES SHUT IN FEAR... THEN CLICK. Bridger opens his eyes... sees Fitzgerald sneering down at him. \nFITZGERALD (CONT'D) And the next time you aim to kill somebody, kid, best remember your gun won't fire without a flint. \nFitzgerald tosses the rifle back at Bridger, and turns away. Bridger's face flushes with rage and humiliation... he charges Fitzgerald from behind... tackles him to the ground... starts pounding Fitzgerald with punches. \n", "test3_input": "Three Feathers runs his hand across Glass' back, dragging a HANDFUL OF WORMS for Glass to see. As Glass' eyes widen in panic, Spotted Horse SLAMS THE BUTT OF HIS KNIFE against Glass' head. \nGlass drops to his knees... makes a dazed grab for Spotted Horse... misses... and Spotted Horse HITS GLASS AGAIN. Glass tumbles unconscious to the dirt. \nSpotted Horse says something to the others... they grab Glass' limp arms... drag him toward the horses. \nEXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - NIGHT \nDozens of glowing campfires dot the prairie, along with a sea of tee-pees, their willow poles fanning against the night sky. Animal hides and painted designs decorate the various tee-pees and lodges. SIOUX CHILDREN laugh and play about the village... freeze when they hear Spotted Horse and the other riders splash across the stream. \nThe warriors ride into the village, Glass' body tossed over the back of Three Feather's horse. The children race to them. \nANGLE ON GLASS... regaining consciousness... eyes blinking... trying to focus. \nCUT TO: \nGLASS' POV - FROM THE BACK OF THE HORSE... \n...to the children's eager faces swarming around him... studying this strange face. \nSpotted Horse - YELLING SOMETHING at the children... they back away from Glass... fall into line behind the riders. \nSioux MEN and WOMEN watch as the procession moves past... to a tee-pee set away from the rest... its hide walls decorated with wild lightning bolts and buffalo and vaguely human figures circling the sun. \nAn OLD MEDICINE MAN, gnarled and leathery, a DEAD RAVEN tied in his long hair, his naked chest painted with red and black stripes, steps out of the tee-pee. He eyes Glass, as Three Feathers and Running Fox carry him inside. \nSuddenly, the Medicine Man begins CHANTING. \nCUT TO: \nA FLURRY OF IMAGES ACCOMPANIED BY THE MEDICINE MAN'S V.O. CHANTING... \nLEATHER STRAPS SNAPPING AROUND GLASS' WRISTS AND ANKLES... stretched tight. \nGlass, naked, on his stomach at the center of the tee-pee, his arms and legs outstretched, secured to wooden stakes in the ground. The white worms cover his back. \nThe Medicine Man... CHANTING... waving burning sticks in the air. \nA THICK LIQUID BOILING IN A POT... the Medicine Man's twisted hand reaching a gourd container in... filling it with the steaming mixture. \nThe liquid POURING OVER GLASS' BACK. \nGLASS' FACE... arched to the sky... twisted in horrible pain. He SCREAMS THAT HORRIBLE GROWLING CRY. \nMORE IMAGES... even faster... the CHANTING more frantic... \nA SIOUX WOMAN,(WAKI), staring down. \nHANDS wiping a GREEN SLUDGE over Glass' neck... chest. \nThe Medicine Man dancing... chanting... shaking sticks lined with RATTLESNAKE TAILS. \nThe moonlight shining through the tee-pee, illuminating the images of the buffalo and dancing shapes. \nWaki gently pouring fluid into Glass' mouth. \nThe Medicine Man holding the SEVERED HEAD OF A SNAKE... lightly sinking the fangs around the wounds on Glass' throat. \nGLASS' EYES... wide open... rolling up white into his head. \nAND THE CHANTING STOPS... the world goes dark. \nEXT. YELLOWSTONE RIVER - DAY \nCutting through the open prairie. Snow-covered peaks touch the sky in the distance. \nFitzgerald and Bridger trudge their way across the prairie, dressed in furs. They rise up a steep slope... reach the top, and spot the cluster of log buildings inside a massive thirty-foot tall wooden fence. Fort Union. \nBridger smiles... relieved. \nFITZGERALD `Bout goddamn time. \nThey start down the slope. Fitzgerald grabs Bridger's arm... firmly. \n", "test3_true": "Bridger doesn't respond. Fitzgerald doesn't like that. \nFITZGERALD (CONT'D) You're as guilty as me in leavin' him. Don't you forget that. You got a future up here. No sense tossin' it away when he was as good as dead already. Shit, all we did was skip the funeral. \nBridger pulls his arm free... continues on. \nFITZGERALD (CONT'D) I won't take to givin' up that two- hundred on accounta you gettin' weak-kneed. \nBridger keeps walking. Fitzgerald follows behind. \nINT. FORT UNION - DAY \nLike a small town surrounded by a log wall. The main TRADING POST BUILDING is busy... TRAPPERS, SIOUX, all with things to trade. But most of the life is in the FORT UNION SALOON next door... crowded with customers downstairs, and just as busy in the whores' rooms upstairs. \nA small village of tents rests off to the side of the buildings, holding the overflow of traffic. \nINT. SALOON - DAY \nFitzgerald and Bridger enter the crowded room... squeeze their way to the bar. \nFITZGERALD Twice the folks here than when we left. \nBRIDGER We should go see Captain Henry. \nFITZGERALD Far as we hiked... we got time for a drink on the company's tab. \nPIG (O.S.) Jim! \nThey spin... see Pig, Murphy and Stubby Bill sitting at a table. Pig scrambles up... rushes to Bridger, locking him in a big bear hug. \nPIG (CONT'D) You made it! I was scared the `Ree mighta caught up to ya. \nFITZGERALD If your fat ass could get through, we didn't have no worries. \nPig glares at Fitzgerald... watches him walk to the table, joining the others. \nPIG (off Fitzgerald, to BRIDGER) Had to be a helluva long walk for you. \nBridger nods... Pig has no idea. \nPIG (CONT'D) Hugh? \nBridger hesitates a beat, then just shakes his head. \nPIG (CONT'D) Guess we all knowed how it would turn out. Did he suffer much more? \nAnother long beat, then... \nBRIDGER I hope not. \nA PROSTITUTE walks down the stairs... stops on the landing, waiting for her next customer. Fitzgerald spots her... grins. \nFITZGERALD (TO BRIDGER) Maybe we best go see Henry, kid. I just got a itch to spend the first of my two-hundred. \nThe other men laugh. Not Bridger. \nINT. ROCKY MOUNTAIN FUR COMPANY OFFICE - DAY \nHenry sits at his desk. Fitzgerald and Bridger stand across from him. The others... Pig, Anderson, Murphy, and Stubby Bill crowd the room behind them. \nFITZGERALD I won't pretend to been his friend, but I respect any man that fights the way he done. \nHENRY And the grave? \nFITZGERALD We had those extra days so we went deeper... covered it in rocks. To keep the scavengers off him. \nHENRY Any sign of hostiles? \nFITZGERALD Not a one. \nThe words are like a punch in the gut to Bridger. He can't take the pain... opens his mouth to speak, but Fitzgerald beats him to it. \nFITZGERALD (CONT'D) Truth is, I was worried `bout `Ree, and ready to get movin', but Bridger here argued to stay and make a cross for the grave. \n"}

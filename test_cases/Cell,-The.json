CAMPBELL CENTER - CONFERENCE ROOM \nNovak instructs him... \nNOVAK Find out the history of that machine. Who bought it, used it, sold it.  And check Stargher's pay stubs.  I want to know every contractor he worked for. I'm calling you from the chopper in ten minutes. \nDizziness and disorientation again hit Novak.  Pale and sweating, he winces as his stomach agonizingly cramps. \nRAMSEY Jesus Christ, man, you look like hell. \nNOVAK Considering where I've been... \nFighting the pain, he gathers together MAPS, slips on his shoes and grabs gun and holster.  Ramsey is apoplectic. \nRAMSEY Whoa-whoa-whoa.  Mind telling me what the fuck is happening? \nNovak points to the photo of Stargher's basement, specifically the hoist. \nRAMSEY (CONT'D) You're bettin' the farm on something you saw after they pumped you full of god knows-what kind of shit? \nNOVAK I saw her.  Julia.  Alive.  I saw everything. \nRAMSEY You might've seen Jimmy Hoffa dancing with Timothy Leary.  I don't care. \nNovak is not stopping... \nINT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY \nIN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Miriam shines the penlight into Catherine's eyes. \nCATHERINE ...a pocketful of rye. \nMIRIAM Four and twenty blackbirds... \nCATHERINE Baked in a pie. \nAT THE CONSOLE, on a security monitor, Henry can see Novak and Ramsey exiting down the corridor. \nHENRY The FBI has left the building. \nIN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Miriam appears concerned. \nMIRIAM Damn him. \nCATHERINE What's wrong? \nMIRIAM Agent Novak.  I didn't get a chance to clear him. \nCatherine encourages her. \nCATHERINE Go.  I'm fine.  Go. \nAs Miriam hurries to catch Novak, she tells Henry. \nMIRIAM Keep an eye on her. \nHe nods, but isn't really paying attention.  Catherine turns to Stargher's motionless form, still suspended, still connected to the machinery. \n", "test1_true": "JULIA Do something, Julia. \nShe looks around the room and runs her hands along the walls, the tile, looking for a weak spot.  She focuses on the CEILING PANEL and although it's painful because of swollen fingers, removes her ENGAGEMENT RING. \nEXT. CAMPBELL CENTER \nA ready-and-waiting HELICOPTER is on the pad.  Novak races out of the Center, Ramsey right behind him, SHOUTING at each other in order to hear above the chopper noise. \nRAMSEY Pete, listen to me.  What did you really learn in there?  Anything new?  You really think Stargher gave you a save the-day clue?  What if this is all some kind of trick your head is playing on you? \nHe won't consider that.  Novak climbs into the helicopter and buckles himself in.  He looks to Ramsey - you coming? - Ramsey pats the side of the chopper and signals for the pilot to take off. \nINT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY \nHenry analyzes voluminous print-outs from the last procedure. Although his eyes are on the data, he converses with Catherine in the PROCEDURE ROOM via intercom. \nHENRY ...there was a moment when we thought we'd lost Agent Novak as well. \nWe see chemicals flow and computer programs initiate the procedure, but Henry is oblivious. \nHENRY (CONT'D) His post-procedure consciousness recovery was remarkably quick.  Never saw that before.  Hey, remember that one time... \nHe JUMPS when the door to the procedure room SEALS SHUT and mechanisms HUM. \nHENRY (CONT'D) Catherine? \nWhen he looks through the window, Catherine is again suspended, the procedure under way. \nHENRY (CONT'D) What are you doing? \nHe types in a command, but nothing happens.  He tires again. On another keyboard, but gets no response.  When he looks at the \"map\" screens, he sees something odd.  It's a small change, but it makes all the difference in the world. INT. THE CELL - DAY \nLike a rock climber in a crevasse, Julia shimmies up the walls of the cell by bracing herself in a corner and using her hands and feet to push up.  The tile is slippery and each movement precarious. \nShe uses strength and balance to reach a position just below the Plexiglass, the fluorescent light bathing her in an eerie intense glow.  She sees a gap between the glass and the wall and uses her ENGAGEMENT RING to dig into it, SCAPE, SCRAPE, SCRAPING with the diamond. \nTHE SHOWER SPRAYS WATER!  Julia nearly loses her balance, but manages to stay pressed into the corner.  She kicks the shower head, sending the spray as far from her as possible, and continues to dig at the caulking around the light fixture. \nIN THE OBSERVATION ROOM, we see something unexpected.  The clock reads 00:00:00.  That water isn't going to stop. \nINT. CAMPBELL CENTER - EDWARD'S ROOM \nMiriam and Ramsey return to the lab to find Henry anxiously observing from the console. \nHENRY (flustered) She changed the codes. \nMIRIAM What's wrong? \nHENRY It would take hours to re-route the system, and even if I did, I shouldn't. \nRAMSEY What are you talking about? \nMiriam analyzes the situation and regretfully, angrily, worriedly realizes what's happened. \nMIRIAM She's done it.  Stupid, stupid girl... \nRAMSEY Done what? \nHENRY Instead of going into his mind... \nMIRIAM She's bringing Stargher into hers. \nENTRANCE FOUR \n", "test1_id": 1863, "test2_input": "INT. CATHERINE'S WORLD \nA bright, deliriously colorful realm visually reflective of things we saw in Catherine's home.  Unusual trees, rock formations, totems, statues, and a brilliant POOL OF WATER. \nThe pond ripples.  Visible through the crystal-clear water is YOUNG STARGHER, rising to the surface like a drowning victim suddenly breaking through to air.  Panicked, he scrambles to shore and pulls himself to land.  Although the place is comforting and beautiful, he's in strange territory and it frightens him.  Shivering, he hunches down, eyes darting this way and that. \nCATHERINE (O.S.) You're all right, Carl. \nThe boy turns toward the voice and finds CATHERINE, her hair waving in the wind, skin glowing, eyes bright, cutting a magnificent figure in clothes that make her a warrior goddess. She opens her arms and the boy runs to her, basking in the comfort of her embrace.  He shivers and she holds him tightly. \nCATHERINE (CONT'D) It's okay, honey, you're with me now. You're safe here. \nShe looks deeply into his eyes and reassuringly explains. \nCATHERINE (CONT'D) I promised I would help you, and I always keep my promises. \nYOUNG STARGHER Can... \nCatherine is astonished and relieve to hear him speak.  A sad, trembling little voice. \nYOUNG STARGHER (CONT'D) Can I stay here? \nShe is touched that he would ask and strokes his face. \nCATHERINE (regretfully) Oh...no, honey, I'm sorry.  It's doesn't work that way. \nThe boy breaks away from her, turning his back.  She gently takes his hand but he yanks it free. \nCATHERINE (CONT'D) But what if I told you you could come visit? \nHe slowly turns to her. \nCATHERINE (CONT'D) I'll make sure it happens, Carl.  I'll get them to let me do it.  And maybe... maybe we can... \nYoung Stargher's eyes open wide with silent terror.  Over his shoulder, she sees a SNAKE slither through the pool. CENTIPEDES CRAWL over her legs and hair.  She stands and brushes them off.  The atmosphere grows darker and ominous. \nYOUNG STARGHER He found me... \nCatherine bristles as STARGHER KING RISES FROM THE POOL like a human serpent.  The brilliant colors of Catherine's world fade to GRIM TONES. \nYOUNG STARGHER (CONT'D) He always finds me. \nStargher King SCREECHES with anger and confusion. \nSTARGHER KING Where thiisss att?!?!  Me god no like id here... \nHe snarls when he sees Catherine. \nSTARGHER KING (CONT'D) You.  Priddy bish-hor-kund.  You big trubble-mekker... (sneers at the boy) And you.  You cumm home now, liddle cogsugger worm.  Or me god haffa punish you... \nYoung Stargher tightens his embrace of Catherine.  She steps back, away from the pond, hugging the boy tightly. \nCATHERINE No.! \nSTARGHER KING No?!??!?!?!? \nStargher King laughs. \nSTARGHER KING (CONT'D) Hoo you thing you are?? Himm Muther? \nHe comes close and reaches for the boy... \nSTARGHER KING (CONT'D) You gimme liddle worm. \n", "test2_true": "CATHERINE I said no. \nLike a vengeful Valkyrie, she emits what can only be called a BATTLE CRY!  STARGHER ATTACKS!  Arms reaching for her. Catherine BLOCKS, PUNCHES, AND KICKS.  Stargher King doubles over.  Catherine grabs his ears and pulls his face into her bent KNEE, breaking his nose. \nCATHERINE (CONT'D) Welcome to my world. \nAs blood flows from his nostrils, Stargher King grins... \nSTARGHER KING You funny.  You thing you stop me god? \nHE CHARGES.  At the right moment, Catherine sidesteps and SMASHES him in the ribs as he passes.  Stargher King crumples to the ground and she KICKS an uppercut to this chin.  Rising from the mud and muck, Stargher King lands a POWERFUL BLOW to her head, sending her flying.  He lifts the stunned Catherine with one hand and pulls her face to his... \nSTARGHER KING (CONT'D) You cum back wif me god.  You be good bish-hor-kund... \nCatherine looks into his soulless eyes.  Then SPITS in them and BITES his face!  She breaks free as he YOWLS with pain. He steps toward her, but his feet don't move.  The earth itself appears to wrap around them and turn hard, like concrete.  Stargher King HOWLS with frustration. \nCATHERINE My world... \nA SHIMMERING KNIFE seems to enrage from within her forearm, out the flesh and into her hand. \nCATHERINE (CONT'D) My rules. \nShe SLASHES across his chest, drawing blood. \nYOUNG STARGHER (O.S.) No! \nCatherine stops.  And turns to see the distraught Young Stargher. \nYOUNG STARGHER (CONT'D) Don't hurt him! \nShe spins around and sees not Stargher King, but MARTIN. \nYOUNG STARGHER (CONT'D) He didn't mean it.  I was bad. \nDisturbed by the transformation, Catherine backs away.  Her vision blurs, the sound distorts.  And the earth cracks around Stargher King's ankles. \nYOUNG STARGHER (CONT'D) He teached me a lesson.  I deserved it. \nFighting feelings of disorientation, she kneels before the child and rests the knife on the ground. \nCATHERINE No one deserves it, Carl.  No one. \nShe reaches out to him, but the child is JERKED into the air by Stargher King.  In one hand, the monster holds little Carl.  In the other - a KNIFE.  His face and chest red with crimson, Stargher King fixes his eyes on Catherine with a predator's stare. \nSTARGHER KING Yer world.  My knife. \nStargher King raises the blade toward the boy's throat and - SNAP!  The strong arms of an adult Stargher breaks his arm at the elbow.  Both the knife and boy are dropped to the ground as Stargher King YOWLS like a stuck pig, the good arm cradling the other. \nSTARGHER KING (CONT'D) Me god hurt!  Why you do that?  Why?! \nSTARGHER Enough. \nStargher King regards him with disgust. \nSTARGHER KING Enuff?!?! \nMARTIN STARGHER'S VOICE comes from the belly of the beast. \nSTARGHER I'll tell you what's enough... \nStargher and Stargher King square off.  The boy stands between them with the knife at his feet. \nCATHERINE Carl! \n", "test2_id": 1864, "test3_input": "And is hit hard by the sight of DROWNED JULIA, her motionless body floating past him.  HER EYES OPEN and bubbles drift from her nose and mouth.  Novak BANGS on the Plexiglas and calls to her. \nNOVAK JULIA! \nThe thick Plexiglass still remains, but she now can see him. Novak pulls his ID BADGE and smacks it against the glass. \nNOVAK (CONT'D) MOVE ASIDE! \nHe pulls his gun and takes aim.  Julia swims to the top of the cell and presses herself against the ceiling.  BANG-BANG BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG.  Novak fires a circle of shots into the thick plastic.  Water slowly leaks, but the damn thing is still solid.  He lifts the industrial VCR and RAMS it at the bullet-damaged section.  CRACK! CRASH!  WATER POURS FROM THE CELL.  Julia's body descends on the torrent of water.  Novak reaches inside and pulls her to safety.  He's just about to give her CPR when she coughs, sputters, and thirstily drinks in oxygen.  Holding her tightly, Novak sinks to the floor, the water from the cell spilling everywhere. \nEXT. ABANDONED FARM HOUSE \nCole's Suburban leads a contingent of FBI vehicles and local police cars onto the property, sirens blaring. \nINT. THE CELL - DAY \nHearing the sirens, Novak relaxes.  For the first time in god knows how long, he relaxes.  And holds Julia Hickson as if his life depended on it. \nFADE OUT. \nFADE IN: \nEXT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE - DAY \nTwo cars parked outside.  An old, quirky Volvo and a Land Rover. \nINT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE - DAY \nAs a television plays THE WIZARD OF OZ, we find Catherine watching the movie from the couch, sitting up, drinking a cup of tea.  She looks rested and quite cute in gym shorts and a T-shirt, her CAT sleeping next to her.  IN THE KITCHEN, Miriam packs up her stethoscope and blood pressure monitor, moves into the living room as Dorothy falls asleep in a field of poppies... \nMIRIAM I left the nutritional information on the fridge door.  Read it. \nCatherine nods, but she's more interested in the movie. Miriam deposits prescription bottles onto a side table. \nMIRIAM (CONT'D) I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan... \nCATHERINE I don't need them anymore... \nMIRIAM I know. \nBut she leaves them just the same. \nMIRIAM (CONT'D) I'll come by tomorrow after work.  With dinner. \nCATHERINE Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and... \nMIRIAM ...give a kiss to Edward. \nCATHERINE (overlapping) Give a kiss to Edward. \nThe women exchange smiles and Miriam exits. \nEXT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE \nAs Miriam walks to her Land Rover, she sees a government issue Suburban park on the street and Peter Novak exit. \nMIRIAM Agent Novak. \nNOVAK Dr. Kent. \nMIRIAM You're looking well. \nNOVAK Thanks you.  Six weeks off does a body good. (conspiratorially) I heard she got the approval to try the reversal with Edward. \n", "test3_true": "NOVAK Federal Bureau of Investigation, ma'am.

Good luck. \nNovak smiles, waves goodbye, and reaches into the Suburban. \nINT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE \nAs Dorothy and her companions confront the Wizard, there's a KNOCK at the screen door and Catherine sees Novak waiting. \nNOVAK Ready? \nCatherine cradles her cat. \nCATHERINE Ready. \nHe opens the door and escorts a leashed VALENTINE into the living room.  Catherine's cat squirms from her arms and hides under the couch. \nNOVAK That went well. \nCATHERINE Give her a minute. (smiles at the dog) Hello, Valentine. \nNovak unleashes the albino Shepherd and he runs to Catherine, licking her face, wagging his tail. \nNOVAK You sure about this? \nCATHERINE Absolutely. (calling for the cat) Abigail... \nValentine picks up the cat's scent and sniffs around the base of the sofa. \nCATHERINE (CONT'D) I heard Julia and John got married. \nNOVAK Yep.  Eloped. \nCATHERINE Good for them. \nValentine settles on the floor.  Slowly, Abigail's curiosity gets the best of her and she creeps out, sniffing the dog's nose.  Patient and sweet, Valentine lies still, allowing the cat to reach an acceptable level of comfort. \nNOVAK Well look at that. \nCATHERINE I told you.  You have to be optimistic. Believe in them... \nNOVAK So you say. \nAmazingly, Abigail brushes up against the dog and purrs. \nCATHERINE He's mine? \nNOVAK All yours.

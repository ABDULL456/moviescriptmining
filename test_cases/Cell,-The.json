{"train": "The Cell \nFADE IN: \nA SPECK OF DUST \nGrains of sand dance in the wind.  As we glide over a VAST DESERT, the speck of dust becomes a HORSE AND RIDER. CATHERINE YOUNG straddles the beautiful black animal, her mesmerizing eyes scanning the horizon.  A curious breeze blows across her exquisite face and she drinks it in, as if the wind itself were telling something to her... \nCatherine sees a FLICKERING LIGHT in the sand.  She pulls the reins and the horse stops moments before the dune drops into nothingness.  She dismounts, affectionately scratches the horse's neck, and follows the LIGHT.  When she looks over her shoulder, the Arabian is now a child's WOODEN HOBBY HORSE. Not surprised, Catherine smiles and walks down a dune, sand sliding beneath her feet... \nShe finds herself in a valley of dead trees whose decayed, gnarled limbs appear to form hands.  The light dances across her face.  She shades her eyes and pinpoints the source... \nA SMALL MIRROR reflecting rays of bright sun, housed within a locket and chain.  It's held by EDWARD, a haunted-looking boy of seven with a precocious grin and piercing eyes.  He sits on a fallen tree trunk, patiently waiting for her arrival. \nCATHERINE Thanks for the horse. \nHe's a shy child, yet comfortable with Catherine. \nEDWARD You liked him? \nCATHERINE He's beautiful... \nEdward smiles, delighted he made her happy. \nCATHERINE (CONT'D) But I thought we were going sailing. \nThe boy frowns. \nCATHERINE (CONT'D) You promised. \nA devilish glint in his eye, Edward redirects the mirror. Catherine follows the flicker to a TOY BOAT in the sand. \nCATHERINE (CONT'D) We can't fit into that! \nEdward shines light in her eyes, momentarily blinding her, then snaps the locket shut.  When her vision clears, Catherine sees a GIANT SHIP perched among the dunes.  A craft weighing hundreds of tons just sitting there in the desert. \nCATHERINE (CONT'D) That'll do. \nShe walks toward it, but Edward doesn't follow. \nCATHERINE (CONT'D) (coaxing him) Come on, Mister E. \nShe extends her hand, but he adamantly shakes his head no. \nCATHERINE (CONT'D) What now? \nEDWARD (nods at the ship) 's broken. \nUndaunted, she... finds herself standing on the DECK. \nCATHERINE (calling to him) Who says? \nEDWARD Mocky-Lock. \nCATHERINE Oh no... No you don't. \nEDWARD \"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman.  Mocky-Lock wants me where I am.\" \nCATHERINE I bet we can fix it. \nShe opens a rusted iron DOOR.  It makes an HORRIFIC SCREECHING SOUND.  Similar to metal-on-metal, but more piercing, more pained.  As if made by a living thing. \nCATHERINE (CONT'D) (familiar with the noise, a warning to him) Ed-ward... \nMIRIAM I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening. \nCATHERINE (frustrated) It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created. \nMIRIAM If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him.  Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world. \nCATHERINE I do it all the time! \nMIRIAM Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened... \nCATHERINE I'd be there for him. \nMIRIAM And he might blame you for terrifying him.  That one moment could erase all you've accomplished.  And if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone. \nCATHERINE (defeated) Okay, okay... \nMiriam takes a penlight and examines Catherine's eyes. \nMIRIAM Besides, I don't know what it might do to you.  You're already exhausted. (concerned) Have you been sleeping? \nCatherine nods. \nMIRIAM (CONT'D) I can prescribe something... \nCatherine shakes her head no.  Miriam shuts off the penlight and looks at Catherine with professional and personal concern. \nMIRIAM (CONT'D) You're sure?  Any more nightmares? \nCATHERINE (defensively) No. \nMIRIAM Good.  We need you healthy and relaxed. You're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television. \nCATHERINE Yes mother. \nMIRIAM I don't want you up all night reading Edward's case file of the nine millionth time.  Balance, dear girl, is the key. Leave the work here. \nShe taps Catherine's head. \nMIRIAM (CONT'D) Don't bring it home in this. \nCATHERINE Okay. \nMiriam gathers her belongings. \nMIRIAM Henry wants me to try this Vietnamese place he's wild about.  Want to come? \nCATHERINE (declining) I've got to feed my cat.  Besides, I want to get to bed early. \nMIRIAM That's my girl. \nMiriam exits, but Catherine remains, still curious what could happen if things were reversed. \nINT. CAMPBELL CENTER - HALLWAY - DAY \nThe corridors are dark and most everyone has gone home.  At the NURSES STATION, a staff member observes the child on a closed-circuit monitor.  Further down the hall, Miriam and Henry exit.  Wearing a (chic) thrift store coat and lugging a worn book bag, Catherine stands outside Edward's room, watching him sleep. \nCATHERINE Pleasant dreams, Mister E. \nEXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - DAY \nA GREEN FORD PICK-UP TRUCK cruises down this deserted stretch of two-lane blacktop, the driver carefully maintaining the speed limit.  He signals and exits... \nEXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY \nINT. STARGHER HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT \nCHAINS attached to bizarre HOOKS dangle from the ceiling. Admiring Anne's body, Stargher links the hooks to the rings in his back.  He presses a remote unit and up in the rafters, a series of GEARS click into motion.  The sound is torturous as the mechanical hoist LIFTS Stargher off the ground, pulling at the rings, strips of flesh rising.  Stargher grimaces, but clearly he wants the pain, needs it.  As the hoist clicks into another gear, it carries Stargher over the table until his body is perfectly positioned above Anne's. \nIn the flickering weird light of the television screen, Stargher resembles something from the twisted imagination of William Blake - a levitating demon ready to debauch an innocent angel.  With his free hand, he touches himself, chains clinking and swaying. \nEXT. RIVER BANK - DAY \nA railroad bridge and highway span an almost-bone-dry creek bed.  Gathered beneath the overpass are the POLICE, CORONER, CRIMINIALISTS, AND A LOCAL FBI.  A SEDAN travels down a service road and stops nearby.  TWO MEN exit, identify themselves as FBI and move to the crime scene. \nSpecial Agent GORDON RAMSEY is well-groomed, prides himself on professionalism, and follows the Bureau party line. Special Agent PETER NOVAK is rough around the edges, introspective, and intense.  A loner who marches to the tune of a peculiar drummer, he's unconventionally handsome with probing eyes.  He moves slowly, observing the scene - the world, for that matter - from a unique perspective. \nAs Ramsey finds the FBI's local liaison - AGENT COLE - Novak oblivious to the people around him, touches dirt, smells the air, and examines road, river, bridge and sky. \nRAMSEY Who found her? \nCole nods at a visibly shaken WORKMAN seated in a patrol car. \nCOLE Surveyor for the railroad... 'Bout six this morning. \nNovak sees a FEMALE BODY wrapped in plastic and bound by wire.  Supervising the examination of the woman is FBI PATHOLOGIST DR. THEODORE \"TEDDY\" LEE, a polite, dapper southern gentleman. \nNOVAK Thanks for waiting, Teddy. \nTeddy gives Novak a friendly, respectful salute - \"My pleasure.\"  Novak dons gloves, nods to an FBI PHOTOGRAPHER and assists Teddy Lee in snipping wire and peeling back thick clear plastic.  As the photographer reacts to a strong smell, Teddy comments. \nTEDDY LEE Bleach. \nAs the man snaps pictures, Ramsey and Cole join them.  Sadly, Novak recognizes the face. \nNOVAK Anne Marie Vicksey. \nWe recognize her, too. \nCOLE She the one from Santa Cruz? \nNOVAK Just graduated law school.  Single mom. Had a two-year-old daughter. \nHe and Teddy expose the bleached flesh of her torso, neither man surprised.  Coldly thorough, Novak finds another of the killer's tell-tale signs. \nNOVAK (CONT'D) (instructing the photographer) The semen on her legs and abdomen. \nFLASH! Photos are taken. \nTEDDY LEE Someone looking after her little girl? \nNOVAK Grandparents.  Live over in Davis. \nNovak looks into the dead white eyes of Anne Vicksey, trying to imagine the horrors she beheld.  He moves to the creek and sees only a few inches of water.  His eyes move from the drop site to the highway above. \nTEDDY LEE The poor thing. \nFLASH!  We're up there now, ON THE OVERPASS, with the photographer and Novak, examining TIRE TRACKS in the soft shoulder.  Novak peers over the edge at the crime scene, steps back, and focuses on the highway - imagining the killer's truck as it disappeared into the night. EXT. OFFICE PLAZA - DAY \nA PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN, JULIA HICKSON, shares lunch with her fiancee, JOHN TRACY.  They talk, laugh and kiss, not a care in the world. \nINT. PICK-UP TRUCK - ACROSS THE STREET - DAY \nAs TALK RADIO plays, Carl Stargher watches them, specifically Julia, his eyes never off her for too long as his hands work on something banal but unseen. \nTALK RADIO HOST ...complaining about government subsidies for farmers... \nThe voice on the radio becomes DISTORTED as we hear it through Stargher's ears... \nTEDDY LEE Now? \nNOVAK Now. \nINT. FORENSIC LABORATORY - DAY \nA MONITOR shows a SINGLE HAIR under a video microscope. Teddy Lee plays with the dials and gets a spectral view. \nTEDDY LEE Complete absence of melanin. \nNovak and Ramsey stand over his shoulder. \nRAMSEY And that means? \nTeddy moves aside and takes another bite of his lunch (chicken fried steak now carry-out). \nNOVAK The dog's an albino. (pictures it) He'd love an animal like that. \nTEDDY LEE Gentlemen, I believe an albino dog is rare indeed. \nINT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT \nExiting an elevator, Julia heads for her little Toyota. Smart girl that she is, her eyes scan the area and her fingers hold a can of mace. \nINT. TOYOTA - NIGHT \nJulia climbs in, checks her mirror and backs up.  WHAM!  Did she hit something??  She brakes, puts the car in park, and checks her sideview mirror. \nReflected there is a WOUNDED DOG.  A white German Shepherd. She rolls down her window and can hear the poor thing whimpering. \nJULIA Oh no... \nINT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT \nJulia exits her car and kneels next to Valentine, who appears to be in terrible pain. \nJULIA God... I didn't see you. \nSTARGHER'S HANDS COME AT HER FROM BEHIND!  One grabs her hair and the other covers her face with a chloroform-soaked towel. He presses so hard, she cannot scream, cannot move.  After a brief struggle, he SHOVES her into her car and holds her until she passes out.  Stargher pushes Julia into the passenger seat and starts the car.  Pulls a dog treat from his pocket and WHISTLES.  The Shepherd instantly perks up. Perfectly healthy.  And jumps into the car. \nSTARGHER (feeds him a treat) Good boy. \nINT. RIVERSIDE COUNTY SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY \nIn a BRIEFING ROOM we find Teddy Lee, Ramsey, Cole and local cops.  All in need of caffeine.  They complain, gossip, and shoot the shit.  Resembling a demanding professor, Novak enters and through presence alone, lacking any self consciousness about his dishevelled appearance, takes control of the room by holding up a PHOTOGRAPH of a young woman. \nNOVAK Donna Krozin. (a new picture every time) Helen Francis, Teresa Manicki... \nThe chatter dies. \nNOVAK (CONT'D) Antoinette Simms, Natalie Pagels, Grace Cassatt... Anne Vicksey. \nEvery person is solemn and focused. \nNOVAK (CONT'D) Smart, gentle, attractive young women. Just starting out in life. Embarking on careers, going to school, getting married... \nHe's hooked them.  The victims, these women, now mean something to them.  With great effect, he holds up grisly post-mortem photos. \nNOVAK (CONT'D) They were killed.  Kidnapped, tortured, and murdered.  By a white male.  About 30-years old. (significantly) Who owns an albino dog./ \nEveryone knows this is a real clue and awareness is heightened.  Ramsey chimes in. \nRAMSEY A purebred German Shepherd. \nJOHN Eight o'clock.  We were going out for my birthday. \nMR. HICKSON Maybe you made a mistake.  Maybe she... she... \nNovak hides the doll. \nRAMSEY No sir.  I'm sorry. \nRamsey's cell-phone rings and he excuses himself to a corner of the room, leaving Novak alone to deal with this uncomfortable, sad situation, no one saying a word until an emotionally shattered Mrs. Hickson, fingering a rosary, feels compelled to tell him. \nNOVAK After three years she remembers what the guy drove? \nRAMSEY She remembers because it was her \"dream truck.\"  Wanted one just like it. \nEXT. SMALL AIRPORT - DAY \nRamsey and Novak exit a small jet and are met by FBI Agent STOCKWELL. \nSTOCKWELL Ramsey, Novak? \nThey nod and he directs them to a waiting GMC SUBURBAN. \nSTOCKWELL (CONT'D) Agent Stockwell. \nNOVAK Where is he? \nSTOCKWELL Edison.  Just east of Loma Park.  SWAT's had the house under surveillance for about twenty minutes. (info memorized) Suspect is Carl Rudolph Stargher.  No registered weapons, no priors.  Got a license for his dog, though.  Named him Valentine... \nINT. GMC SUBURBAN - DAY \nStockwell is behind the wheel, racing down the highway. Ramsey's in the passenger seat, Novak in back.  Shotguns and body armor line the cargo area.  Novak's eyes target the FAX, a copy of Stargher's license and registration, and the grainy dot-matrix image of the suspect's face.  And Novak knows he's found him. \nNOVAK You're the bad man, aren't you, Carl? \nEXT. STARGHER HOUSE/NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY \nA sparsely populated lower-middle class neighborhood.  A half dozen plain houses at the end of a cul-de-sac.  Bare trees. Brown lawns.  Crows in the air. \nThe house furthest from the main road has a white Ford F250 pick-up in the driveway.  Green trim. \nTHE SUBURBAN, hidden from Stargher's house, four-wheels it through a prairie and stops outside the backyard of a PRESCHOOL, where two more Suburbans and a van already wait. \nINT. PRESCHOOL - DAY \nStockwell introduces Ramsey and Novak to BROCK, leader of the FBI Tactical Unit, a calm, confident ex-Marine wearing a black uniform and body armor. \nBROCK Glad you could make it.  We lose the sun in half an hour. \nNovak and Ramsey join him at the shaded window to observe Stargher's house.  Children's drawings fill the wall.  As Brock explains, Novak checks with binoculars. \nBROCK (CONT'D) Perimeter's two-hundred yards around the house.  Three men at the rear, two on each side, four up front.  I've got two marksmen on the roof. \nNOVAK Have they seen him? \nBROCK No.  There's been movement in the kitchen.  But it could be the dog. (important) You think she's in there? \nNovak is careful with his answer. \nNOVAK We proceed assuming she is. \nRAMSEY Let's give old Carl a call.  Tell him he's got company. \nNOVAK No. (to Brock) Can you get a man close? \nJohn tries to keep his composure, but Novak's making this tough for him.  Novak wants the scientists to see, to understand the boy's pain. \nNOVAK (CONT'D) Each tape is the same.  He provides food, drinking water, a toilet. Periodically, a shower starts.  It's on some kind of timer - he's clever with machines, building things.  I think he wants them to believe this is a simple kidnapping.  That there's a possibility of rescue.  Of survival.  But it's just a form of torture.  At the end of the fortieth hour, the drain shuts.  The water starts and doesn't stop. (gravely) We've already lost more than a day.  If she isn't found tonight.  She dies like the rest. \nCOOPERMAN (to Miriam, Henry and Catherine) John and Ella Baines - as well as the Sunerset Board of Directors - have given their approval, but the decision is yours. \nMIRIAM What about the legalities of this...? \nNOVAK Stargher is in custody.  The functional equivalent of being under arrest. Normally, we'd Mirandize him, and if he didn't lawyer up, we'd interrogate him. But because of his condition, he doesn't have the capacity to waive those rights. \nHENRY So what you're asking us to do is illegal? \nNOVAK No, not at all. (explains) We're dealing with exigent circumstances.  Somewhere there's a kidnapped woman still alive.  If we weigh the suspect's Constitutional Rights against the public safety. The Law favors the victim and gives us a lot of leeway.  It's called the Public Safety Exception. \nCOOPERMAN So what can you do? \nNOVAK Pretty much anything we want.  There's a chance to save a human life.  Because of that, Stargher has no reasonable expectation of privacy. \nMiriam, Henry and Cooperman appear to be onboard.  Novak's made a persuasive, heartfelt argument.  Only one person still remains uncertain. \nCATHERINE What if...? \nAll eyes turn to her. \nCATHERINE (CONT'D) What if he wasn't like this?  What if he was \"normal?\"  Conscious.  How far would you go? \nNOVAK As far as I needed. \nCatherine nods, analyzes Novak's eyes, gestures, body language, and \"interrogates\" him. \nCATHERINE Do you think he'd tell you what you need to know? \nJohn's discomfort is increasing and Novak is sensitive to it. \nNOVAK There's always a chance they'll confess. \nCATHERINE Really?  I don't work with violent cases, I work with children.  But even a kid lies.  They love it when they get you to believe something that isn't true.  Don't you think Stargher would do the same? \nNOVAK Sometimes... Once they've been caught they feel a need for disclosure.  They have so much they want to tell. But they've never had a sympathetic ear. They need someone to understand why. (focusing on Catherine) Stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully.  It was part of the ritual. Some weren't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean.  But these last three... They were still in water - always in water - but (clarifies) Listen, he wasn't just careless.  It went beyond that... \nCATHERINE Okay.  Let's assume he wanted you to find him, that some part of him hated what he was doing... Most likely, that part is dead.  Schizophrenics with Whalen's Infraction sever all ties with the real world.  I'm sorry, I really am. \nRAMSEY Is it possible? \nCATHERINE If he came to trust me, yes, but it takes months to build that kind of trust.  Someone like Stargher can't distinguish between fantasy and reality. It's all the same.  He might tell me she's in Timbuktu and absolutely, one hundred percent believe it to be true, but she's... \nJOHN (O.S.) Julia. \nThey turn to John Tracy.  His vulnerable, barely audible voice forcing everyone to listen. \nJOHN (CONT'D) Not \"she.\"  Julia.  Not thing, or it, or her.  Do you know anything about her? Do you know what we've been through? Julia is everything to me.  Can you say that about anyone? \nCatherine hangs her head.  And finds herself looking at photograph of the girl in question.  A smiling Julia Hickson looking right at her. \nWHOOP-WHOOP-WHOOP-WHOOP.  POUNDING REVERBERATIONS... \nEXT. CAMPBELL CENTER - DAY \nWHOOP-WHOOP-WHOOP-WHOOP.  A HELICOPTER descends onto the pad. A stretcher is removed from the side door of the helicopter. \nINT. CAMPBELL CENTER - VARIOUS/TRAVELLING - DAY \nThe STAFF watches with a mixture of fear and curiosity as a stretcher bearing the catatonic Stargher is wheeled FAST through the corridors by an FBI escort team. \nNOVAK I still don't understand why I can't do this... This isn't some \"troubled kid\" you're dealing with. \nCATHERINE I realize that... \nNOVAK How hard could it be...? \nCatherine and Miriam try to hide their laughter. \nCATHERINE The first... What?  Six or seven times I went in.   Remember what happened? \nMIRIAM Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia. \nCATHERINE Like a New Year's Day hangover. \nMIRIAM He needs to be turned over. \nNovak and Catherine roll Stargher onto his stomach. \nNOVAK This man is deeply disturbed, he... \nCATHERINE You don't know the procedure. \nNOVAK I know him. \nMIRIAM That may be true, but you don't have Catherine's gift.  She... (distracted by Stargher's back) What happened here? \nWe see a series of EIGHT BANDAGES. \nRAMSEY We removed eight metal rings. \nMiriam peels away a bandage and examines the flesh. \nCATHERINE Then he should like this. \nCatherine connects Stargher to the SUSPENSION APPARATUS and it HOISTS him off the table. \nCATHERINE (CONT'D) They're comforted by the feeling of weightlessness.  Like floating in water. \nHenry catches Ramsey poking his nose near a THIRD SUIT AND APPARATUS in the dressing area. \nHENRY Don't touch that, please. \nRAMSEY Sorry. \nMiriam prepares a series of CHEMICAL CARTRIDGES and loads them into a container connected to the IV-like tubes linked to the suspension device. \nMIRIAM (intimate, quiet) This isn't your responsibility. Remember that.  Don't let them use guilt as a tool.  If you want to stop, say so. \nCATHERINE I'll be fine. \nMIRIAM She said convincingly. \nCatherine focuses on the procedure and makes the necessary connections.  Reluctantly, Miriam retreats to the monitoring station.  She \"locks down\" the procedure room and joins Henry, Novak, and Ramsey at the console. \nNOVAK (eyes on the chemical/drug monitors) That's the stuff? \nHENRY About twelve years of research, right Miriam? \nMIRIAM Don't remind me. \nRAMSEY What is it - are they - exactly? \nThat's like asking her to explain the rules of cricket. \nCatherine spots the boy as he crawls into a specific \"room.\" Shortly after, a LIGHT comes on within the cubicle and she moves to it.  We feel as though we're looking at a series of interlocked tenement rooms, some walls of which have been torn away to expose rooms within, rooms with no windows or doors.  Following a path of fragile steps, Catherine makes her way to the LIGHTED ROOM and enters. \nINT. STARGHER'S WORLD - LIGHTED ROOM \nA mottled HORSE stands with its head down, nose kissing the floor, allowing the BOY to caress its neck.  This sweet animal is an incrongruous vision in this hellish world and Catherine approaches with respect. \nCATHERINE Hello? \nThe frightened child retreats into a corner of the claustrophobic room, but the horse does not startle. Surprisingly - to the boy - the horse takes an affectionate step toward Catherine, inviting her to take over.  Catherine allows the mare to smell her, then vigorously scratches along the mane and shoulder, much to the horse's delight. \nCATHERINE (CONT'D) Yeah, you like that, don't you? \nShe can see the boy hiding in the corner, stealing glances at her from the shadows. \nCATHERINE (CONT'D) Is your name Carl? \nThe boy - YOUNG STARGHER - is startled and intrigued by the question - How did she know that?! - but says nothing. \nCATHERINE (CONT'D) Another little boy I know, he has a horse, too. \nThe boy reacts to an unusual SOUND coming from the CEILING. \nCATHERINE (CONT'D) His name's Edward.  The boy, not the horse... \nThe boy takes a few steps toward her, out of the shadows, but he seems more concerned about something in the ceiling than \"connecting\" with Catherine.  Very anxiously, he looks at the wall behind Catherine and watches an old wind-up kitchen TIMER click down. \nCATHERINE (CONT'D) What's the matter, Carl? \nAgain, a sharp SOUND from the ceiling. \nCATHERINE (CONT'D) What's wro---? \nYoung Stargher RUNS at her and SHOVES her hard!  Catherine FALLS BACK just as EIGHT SHEETS OF GLASS drop from the ceiling!  Like oversize razor blades, they slice the horse into four clean sections.  They separate and compact the quadrants until four glass-contained sections of dissected horse stand within the room.  Catherine SCREAMS, but the mare barely acknowledged what happened.  Betraying no emotion, the boy runs.  The shaken Catherine takes a moment to collect herself, then gives chase. \nINT. STARGHER'S WORLD - THE LABYRINTH \nYoung Stargher knows his way around the landscape, but Catherine has difficulty simply keeping him in sight.  She runs, climbs and crawls.  Until she's utterly lost and disoriented.  Tired and having difficulty breathing, she drops to her knees and \"cools down.\"  She hears a NOISE nearby, gets to her feet, and finds a GEARED MECHANISM connected to some kind of SHUTTERED DOOR composed of an almost metallic-looking glass.  Curious yet cautious, she examines the nearby walls, floor, and ceiling for any signs of \"traps\" akin to the glass blades.  Finding none, she pulls the mechanism and quickly steps back. \nThe shutter opens and Catherine knows there's something alive in the tiny cubicle beyond.  She retreats into shadow, hiding.  Released from the chamber is a WOMAN.  As she moves out of a darkness, we see VICTIM ONE. \nGhostly pale and adorned in eerie fetish garb, she appears to \"sense\" the presence of a stranger, targets Catherine in the shadows, and ATTACKS! \nCatherine's had enough and moves to press the implant, BUT THE VICTIM IS ALREADY THERE! She brutally grabs Catherine, THROWS her against the wall and SMACKS her head against it.  Catherine drops to the floor like a rag doll. \nVictim One hefts Catherine onto her shoulder and with great purpose, carries her deep into the labyrinth, toward the core.  Passing in and out of consciousness, between darkness and light, a dazed Catherine is taken on a \"tour\" of Stargher's world.  Passing mausoleum-like chambers filled with IMAGES of unspeakable horror and/or disturbing intensity.  At one of the rooms, we think we see Young Stargher silently observing... \nSitting of standing in individual cubicles are STARGHER'S OTHER VICTIMS (TWO thru SIX), each woman resembling the grotesque porcelain dolls glimpsed in the cubbyholes in Stargher's basement.  Dressed by a fetishistic sadist (Nine Inch Nails meets the Brides of Dracula), they resemble bored housewives, barely acknowledging the new member of the \"harem.\" INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - THE CORE \nVICTIM ONE drops Catherine in the center of the room and, job done, crawls away. \nGroggy, feeling sick, Catherine sits up.  Unbeknownst to her, she is sitting at the base of a pedestal with her back to the kind of THRONE.  And someone is there.  In the dim pool of light above the pedestal, we see a MAN rise from the throne. The wall behind him is covered in BLOOD RED CLOTH, and as he descends, we realize it is a CAPE connected to EIGHT METAL RINGS pierced through the flesh of his back.  In a fluid motion, waves of red give way to harshly textured concrete as the man reaches the floor.  Catherine knows he is there. Unable to stop herself, she turns.  And sees the terrifying face of STARGHER.  But no the same Stargher. \nThis is STARGHER KING. \nSTARGHER KING (primitive, guttural) Where you come from priddy thing? \nIn a split second, Catherine presses the implant on her hand. \nINT. CAMPBELL CENTER - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nApparently capable of staying awake if properly caffeinated, Novak sits cross-legged on the floor, shoes off, analyzing RECENT PHOTOS AND DOCUMENTS sent to him via courier. Ignoring a snoring Ramsey napping on a nearby cot, Novak looks at blow-ups from the videos, blueprints of Stargher's house, detailed shots of the basement, and a draftsman's conceptual drawing of the cell itself. \nHENRY (V.O.) Gentlemen? \nA worried Novak searches the halls of the Campbell Center. He's about to ask the staff for help, but stops when he sees through the window to Edward's room. \nINT. CAMPBELL CENTER - EDWARD'S ROOM \nCatherine sits next to the boy's bed, holding Edward's hand, softly singing a lullaby (to him, to herself).  Feeling that he must speak to her, Novak intervenes. \nNOVAK Edward Baines, I presume. (to the catatonic child) Hi, Ed.  I'm Pete. \nCATHERINE Do you think that's funny? \nNOVAK No.  Not at all.  From what I understand, he knows I\"m here, isn't that right? \nCatherine nods.  Novak picks up Edward's fallen teddy bear and rests it in the crook of the child's arm. \nNOVAK (CONT'D) I read about a woman in TExas who was in a coma for seven years.  Every time her husband came to visit, her heart would beat faster.  Isn't that something?  I don't know what name scientists have for something like that... \nCATHERINE It doesn't have much to do with science. \nNOVAK What then? \nCATHERINE The soul.  The spirit.  Whatever you want to call it. \nNOVAK Ah, the part of us that can't be explained. \nShe appreciates his understanding.  And finds herself comforted by his presence.  Catherine scrutinizes Novak, his intensity, his honesty, his complexity.  And asks: \nCATHERINE Agent Novak? \nNOVAK Peter, okay? \nCATHERINE Do you feel there's a side of yourself you don't show people? \nThe question catches Novak off-guard, but he's willing to answer.  Anything to get her talking. \nNOVAK Absolutely. (realizing it's too personal) I suppose everyone does. \nCATHERINE Just like we all have fantasies, right? Things only we know, that we don't share. \nNOVAK That's what therapists are for, right? \nCatherine laughs.  It helps her relax.  If only slightly. \nCATHERINE During the sessions.  When I'm inside. I see those things.  What a person hides, what they despite, what they want to control.  With Stargher... \nThis is difficult for her. \nCATHERINE (CONT'D) With Stargher I saw things... \nNOVAK What did you see? \nCATHERINE (professionally) A kingdom.  His utopia. Life without consequence or restriction. He's not even Carl Stargher anymore. He's this... idealized version of himself who can do anything he pleases... Without fear.  A horrible primitive ugly thing. (uncomfortable; re: Edward) I don't want to talk in here. \nShe kisses Edward's forehead and exits. \nINT. CAMPBELL CENTER - CONFERENCE ROOM/COURTYARD - DAY \nCatherine and Novak sit on a bench in the center of the courtyard.  John Tracy is visible in the reception area, unable to sleep, desperately trying to fight frustration. \nCATHERINE Why'd you bring him here? \nNOVAK You're the shrink, you tell me. \nCATHERINE (already knows) As soon as I met him, you knew I'd say yes.  He makes Julia real for me. \nNOVAK Yes.  I am. \nCatherine realizes that was a confession. \nRAMSEY (O.S.) Where the hell you been? \nThey turn to see Ramsey. \nNOVAK Right here. \nRAMSEY Next time, tell me, okay? \nNOVAK But you looked so cute.  All sleepy... \nRamsey shoots him a murderous look, then asks Catherine. \nRAMSEY Your colleagues want to know what to do with Stargher. \nNovak looks to Catherine for the answer.  Through the window blinds, she watches John Tracy lower his head. \nCATHERINE Tell them to prep him.  And that I'll be right there. \nRamsey nods and heads back to the lab. \nNOVAK Thank you. \nBriefly, he touches her hand.  Catherine looks away from John to Novak's hand, to the photographs on the wall.  Stargher's house, Valentine, the pick-up truck.  Valentine... \nCATHERINE I need something. \nINT. CAMPBELL CENTER - CORRIDOR - DAY \nA K-9 UNIT FBI AGENT escorts VALENTINE to the lab. \nINT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY - DAY \nAs the agent brings the frightened animal into the monitoring area, Catherine and Valentine share a moment of \"connection.\" Slowly, confidently, she approaches the Shepherd, kneels, and removes his leash and muzzle.  She strokes him and the dog instantly warms up to her. \nFBI K-9 AGENT Sure wasn't like that with me. \nNovak signs a document and the K-9 Agent exits. \nCATHERINE You're a good boy, aren't you, Valentine? \nThe dog picks up a scent from the procedure room and moves it, Catherine and Novak following. \nIN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Stargher lies face down on a gurney. Now taped to the wall near Stargher are PICTURES from the basement - his dolls, the hoist, etc.  Miriam (in surgical mask and gloves) carefully re-inserts the METAL RINGS (taken from an FBI EVIDENCE BAG) into the eight straps of flesh on his back.  When he sees this, Valentine whimpers and hides. Catherine comforts him.  Miriam finishes her task and removes her mask. \nMIRIAM I hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about this. \nHENRY I think that's the whole point. \nValentine runs to his \"sleeping\" master and barks at Catherine as if asking for help.  She encourages the animal to lick and sniff Stargher's face and hands. \nHENRY (O.S.) (CONT'D) That's interesting. \nIN THE CONTROL ROOM, he scrutinizes the monitor showing the detailed \"map\" of Stargher's brain. \nHENRY (CONT'D) Increased neural activity in the frontal lobes.  Rising dopamine levels in the basal ganglia.  Ever since the dog walked in. \nIN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Catherine readies herself in the \"receive\" apparatus.  As Stargher is lifted off the pedestal, the doors HISS shut and Valentine curls up on the floor beneath his master.  As Catherine is lifted, she smiles at the animal, then looks to Stargher. \nNOVAK (comforting and coaching her) Remember, Julia Hickson is priority number one.  Nothing else matters.  Find out where she is. \nCatherine cannot show her fear, not now.  She composes herself and approaches him. \nCATHERINE I want to help you, Carl. \nHis grin broadens to a smile and he almost laughs. \nSTARGHER Help me?  That's good.  That's a good one. (malevolent) Liar.  Whore.  Cunt. \nCatherine stands her ground. \nCATHERINE You sound like your father. \nHe gets close to her face and sneers. \nSTARGHER I am not like him. \nStargher retreats into the shadows, but Catherine persists. \nCATHERINE Then help me.  Where is Julia Hickson? \nSTARGHER Why? \nCATHERINE Maybe, because you want to. \nSTARGHER Is that right?  You think you know me? INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY - DAY \nHenry sees a rapid rise in Catherine's warning meter. \nHENRY Miriam... \nINT. STARGHER'S WORLD - BATHROOM \nA wave of fear, of impending doom, overtakes Catherine. \nSTARGHER (O.S.) You wanna know who I am?  You stupid bitch! \nAnd when he emerges from shadow, Stargher is STARGHER KING. \nSTARGHER KING Now shud you mouth, priddy thing, or me god slice you from the kunt to the tits. \nCatherine moves to touch the sensor in her hand.  He GRABS, LIFTS and SLAMS her onto the floor, the back of her head HITTING HARD.  Her vision blurs.  Ears are ringing. \nSTARGHER KING (CONT'D) Me god want you stay. \nStargher King straddles Catherine and pins her arms behind her back.  She's unable to touch the sensor.  With the tip of the TOOL he traces a line from her pelvis up the center of her suit. \nSTARGHER KING (CONT'D) Me god mek you beaudiful... \nHe shoves the tool through her neck and presses the trigger. A COLLAR CLAMPS SHUT around Catherine's neck and... \nShe blacks out. \nINT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY \nA SENSOR ALARM SOUNDS on the computer.  Henry and Miriam express shock at the sight of the monitor peaking in the red and move to the \"map\" of Catherine's mind.  As it becomes \"cool,\" Stargher's becomes \"hot.\" \nMIRIAM Son of a bitch! \nIN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, VALENTINE BARKS!  Startling everyone. The dog GROWLS and backs away.  As if he senses something horribly wrong within his master. \nIN THE CONTROL ROOM, Novak questions the scientists. \nNOVAK When we got here, you just topped and pulled her out. \nHENRY We should hurry. \nMiriam walks Novak through what's about to happen. \nMIRIAM The first five minutes will be disorienting.  Give yourself time.  Let the drugs do the work.  If you can see, smell, feel, hear, taste things - you're on the right track.  Once you've acclimated, try to get a feeling for Catherine.  Instinct plays a huge role in this.  Trust it. \nShe gives him a supportive touch on the shoulder, exits and shuts the door.  IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM, Miriam continues via intercom. \nMIRIAM (CONT'D) You can control how you see yourself - clothes, shoes, that kind of thing - but the rest of it is up to him.  Use only what he provides.  Don't try to change anything.  Or introduce something of your own.  It'll only upset him. \nIN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Novak flexes his fingers and sees the little bump beneath his flesh. \nHENRY (O.S.) Agent Novak?  Press the sensor. \nNovak does and the red light comes on.  As Novak is LIFTED, he looks at Catherine, then Stargher.  Valentine YIPS and settles beneath Novak.  The suspension device clicks into place and the MASK descends. \nMIRIAM (O.S.) No matter what happens, Peter, remember one thing: It's not real. \nNovak's eyes fix on the clear liquid contained in the IV-like cylinder.  A liquid cloud of his blood grows within. Preparing the mixture for injection. \nThe viscosity of the fluid starts to thicken and the CAMERA MOVES INTO THE MIXTURE.  As blood and chemical swirls take shape, we MOVE FAST.  Deeper into the fluid at a molecular level.  We feel like we're SOARING over some kind of liquid landscape. \nNOVAK HYPERVENTILATES.  He's having difficulty making the 98 transition. \nFlying faster, faster, faster.  Through an entire universe. \nNovak is in the procedure room.  Alone.  His face contorted as if feeling the effects of tremendous G-FORCE. \nENTRANCE THREE \nINT. STARGHER'S WORLD \nCLOUDS hover above a dark, gloomy landscape dotted with hills.  THREE IDENTICAL WOMEN sit on black earth, their bodies positioned in a uniform pattern.  PULL BACK TO REVEAL NOVAK at their feet, in a kneeling fetal position, face down in the gritty soil, a piece of cloth draped over his head. With difficulty, practically inhaling black grit, Novak breathes deeply and rises to his knees.  His hand moves to his face and he's briefly astounded by the texture of the gravel, the sharpness of it against his face.  Removing the shroud-like cloth, he looks at the soil, smells it, tastes it. \nMOTHER ONE (O.S.) Have you seen him? \nNovak finds the first of the three - VISIONS OF STARGHER'S MOTHER - addressing him.  She, like the other two, speaks in a ghostly monotone, nearly devoid of emotion. \nMOTHER ONE (CONT'D) My boy, my little one.  His father took him from me.  Have you seen him? \nAs she continues, almost mantra-like, WOMAN TWO BEGINS: \nMOTHER TWO (similar monotone) My child is an abomination.  He is damned.  He has no soul. \nThe women's repetitive \"monologues\" overlap.  Aurual layers now added by THREE. \nMOTHER THREE Me god me boy.  Me god good son. \nNovak takes a moment to absorb his surroundings.  The sights, sounds and feel of the place.  Like being within a dream.  As he backs away from the odd quartet, SHIMMERING LIGHT dances across his face.  Shading his eyes.  Novak searches for the source. \nOpposite him, across the valley, is a SHEER ROCK WALL.  A massive cliff face pockmarked with rough \"windows.\"  Like a star, the LIGHT sparkles inside one of them, a fragment of MIRROR reflecting a beam away from Novak's face to a PATH cutting across the valley floor to the base of the wall. \nThe light guiding him, Novak follows the path and starts to CLIMB, finding stairs or ladders, passing deep, seemingly infinite passages.  Like tombs, or the \"drawers\" of a mausoleum.  Deep within one of them, THE LIGHT FLICKERS. Fades.  And Novak crawls into darkness. \nINT. STARGHER'S WORLD - THE DEN \nNovak emerges in a cavernous room dripping with decadence. The place reeks of sex, pain, lust, and cruelty.  As he moves deeper into the chamber, Novak sees YOUNG STARGHER perched atop some kind of pedestal, crouching, fingering his mirror LOCKET, bouncing sparkles of light into the dark corners of the room \nThe FLICKERING LIGHT pinpoints a FIGURE emerging from the darkness.  It is Catherine.  Altered to an image of Stargher's victims.  Her skin, face, clothing, eyes, are just like the Victims'.  It's a shocking, strange image, made even more disturbing by the look of pleasure on her face.  Novak is staggered by the sight.  His vision and hearing become affected by blurred vision, sharp sounds - then focus to clarity as he reminds himself... \nNOVAK Not real... \nLike an ethereal queen of the damned, she strides toward him, narrowing her eyes. \nCatherine and Novak RUN out of the den, into the tunnel from which Novak gained access.  He stops, ready to press the sensor, when a FLICKER OF LIGHT dances across Catherine's face. \nCATHERINE Wait... \nNOVAK Like hell \"wait.\" \nBut she won't listen and he's forced to play catch up as she moves further from the den toward the cliff face.  The FLICKER OF LIGHT shines on the entrance to a specific TUNNEL. \nCATHERINE He wants us to follow.  The little boy... \nNOVAK Little boy?!  That's him! \nCATHERINE He brought you to me, didn't he?  If you want Julia to live, trust me.  Trust him. \nINT. TUNNEL/CUBBYHOLE \nOn her hands and knees, she enters the TUNNEL, not waiting for him to respond.  She knows what he'll do... Catherine and Novak crawl through the dark, grimy claustrophobic space, playing with his mirror locket. \nCATHERINE Carl... \nHe so desperately wants her affection, but fear prevents him from reaching out to her. \nCATHERINE (CONT'D) This is Peter. \nScared, he shakes his head \"no.\" \nCATHERINE (CONT'D) Don't be scared.  You're my friend and I would never hurt you. \nShe extends her hand.  Oh-so-hesitantly he takes it. \nCATHERINE (CONT'D) Will you take us to her?  To Julia? \nShyly, hesitantly, he nods.  She smiles gratefully and affectionately touches the boy's face.  Clasping her hand, Young Stargher leads Catherine and Novak into utter darkness. \nINT. STARGHER'S WORLD - THE IDEALIZED CELL \nMore stylized than the actual cell, it's bigger and ornately decorated, with the atmosphere of a church.  Individual IMAGES hang like SHRINES, each showing Julia Hickson from different angles. \nCentral to the room is a WINDOW INTO THE CELL ITSELF.  Where we find a beautiful, mermaid-like JULIA HICKSON floating in water.  Peaceful, joyous. \nIN THE CENTER OF THE ROOM, we find Novak and Catherine, she holding the hand of Young Stargher, he stunned at the sight of Julia.  The child looks at Catherine with beatific, sad eyes, regarding her as one would a saviour. \nNOVAK Where the hell are we? \nCATHERINE Carl, do you know?  Like on a map... \nHe shakes his head and buries his face in her shoulder. \nCATHERINE (CONT'D) It's okay, it's okay.  You helped so much already.  I'm proud of you. \nAs a frustrated Novak searches for anything identifying, Catherine comforts the boy and looks deeply into his sad, haunted eyes. \nCATHERINE (CONT'D) Carl, I think I can help you.  Would you like that?  Even if Peter can't find Julia, I want to help you. \nThe boy leans against her and she caresses his face. \nCATHERINE (CONT'D) I promise. \nNovak finds himself standing in front of the idealized cell. Mounted beneath the glass is a shiny, perfect metal plaque reading CARVER INDUSTRIAL EQUIPMENT, with a logo.  Novak recognizes it from the hoist in Stargher's basement. \nNOVAK Let's go. \nHe pulls her to her feet.  Feeling betrayed and rejected, the child breaks away from her.  THE ROAR OF STARGHER KING shakes the cell.  Terrified, the boy searches for a place to hide. \nNOVAK (CONT'D) There's some kind of plaque, a metal plate, with a logo.  On the base. \nCole locates it. \nCOLE (reading) Carver Industrial Equipment. \nINT. CAMPBELL CENTER - CONFERENCE ROOM \nNovak instructs him... \nNOVAK Find out the history of that machine. Who bought it, used it, sold it.  And check Stargher's pay stubs.  I want to know every contractor he worked for. I'm calling you from the chopper in ten minutes. \nDizziness and disorientation again hit Novak.  Pale and sweating, he winces as his stomach agonizingly cramps. \nRAMSEY Jesus Christ, man, you look like hell. \nNOVAK Considering where I've been... \nFighting the pain, he gathers together MAPS, slips on his shoes and grabs gun and holster.  Ramsey is apoplectic. \nRAMSEY Whoa-whoa-whoa.  Mind telling me what the fuck is happening? \nNovak points to the photo of Stargher's basement, specifically the hoist. \nRAMSEY (CONT'D) You're bettin' the farm on something you saw after they pumped you full of god knows-what kind of shit? \nNOVAK I saw her.  Julia.  Alive.  I saw everything. \nRAMSEY You might've seen Jimmy Hoffa dancing with Timothy Leary.  I don't care. \nNovak is not stopping... \nINT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY \nIN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Miriam shines the penlight into Catherine's eyes. \nCATHERINE ...a pocketful of rye. \nMIRIAM Four and twenty blackbirds... \nCATHERINE Baked in a pie. \nAT THE CONSOLE, on a security monitor, Henry can see Novak and Ramsey exiting down the corridor. \nHENRY The FBI has left the building. \nIN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Miriam appears concerned. \nMIRIAM Damn him. \nCATHERINE What's wrong? \nMIRIAM Agent Novak.  I didn't get a chance to clear him. \nCatherine encourages her. \nCATHERINE Go.  I'm fine.  Go. \nAs Miriam hurries to catch Novak, she tells Henry. \nMIRIAM Keep an eye on her. \nHe nods, but isn't really paying attention.  Catherine turns to Stargher's motionless form, still suspended, still connected to the machinery. \nINT. CATHERINE'S WORLD \nA bright, deliriously colorful realm visually reflective of things we saw in Catherine's home.  Unusual trees, rock formations, totems, statues, and a brilliant POOL OF WATER. \nThe pond ripples.  Visible through the crystal-clear water is YOUNG STARGHER, rising to the surface like a drowning victim suddenly breaking through to air.  Panicked, he scrambles to shore and pulls himself to land.  Although the place is comforting and beautiful, he's in strange territory and it frightens him.  Shivering, he hunches down, eyes darting this way and that. \nCATHERINE (O.S.) You're all right, Carl. \nThe boy turns toward the voice and finds CATHERINE, her hair waving in the wind, skin glowing, eyes bright, cutting a magnificent figure in clothes that make her a warrior goddess. She opens her arms and the boy runs to her, basking in the comfort of her embrace.  He shivers and she holds him tightly. \nCATHERINE (CONT'D) It's okay, honey, you're with me now. You're safe here. \nShe looks deeply into his eyes and reassuringly explains. \nCATHERINE (CONT'D) I promised I would help you, and I always keep my promises. \nYOUNG STARGHER Can... \nCatherine is astonished and relieve to hear him speak.  A sad, trembling little voice. \nYOUNG STARGHER (CONT'D) Can I stay here? \nShe is touched that he would ask and strokes his face. \nCATHERINE (regretfully) Oh...no, honey, I'm sorry.  It's doesn't work that way. \nThe boy breaks away from her, turning his back.  She gently takes his hand but he yanks it free. \nCATHERINE (CONT'D) But what if I told you you could come visit? \nHe slowly turns to her. \nCATHERINE (CONT'D) I'll make sure it happens, Carl.  I'll get them to let me do it.  And maybe... maybe we can... \nYoung Stargher's eyes open wide with silent terror.  Over his shoulder, she sees a SNAKE slither through the pool. CENTIPEDES CRAWL over her legs and hair.  She stands and brushes them off.  The atmosphere grows darker and ominous. \nYOUNG STARGHER He found me... \nCatherine bristles as STARGHER KING RISES FROM THE POOL like a human serpent.  The brilliant colors of Catherine's world fade to GRIM TONES. \nYOUNG STARGHER (CONT'D) He always finds me. \nStargher King SCREECHES with anger and confusion. \nSTARGHER KING Where thiisss att?!?!  Me god no like id here... \nHe snarls when he sees Catherine. \nSTARGHER KING (CONT'D) You.  Priddy bish-hor-kund.  You big trubble-mekker... (sneers at the boy) And you.  You cumm home now, liddle cogsugger worm.  Or me god haffa punish you... \nYoung Stargher tightens his embrace of Catherine.  She steps back, away from the pond, hugging the boy tightly. \nCATHERINE No.! \nSTARGHER KING No?!??!?!?!? \nStargher King laughs. \nSTARGHER KING (CONT'D) Hoo you thing you are?? Himm Muther? \nHe comes close and reaches for the boy... \nSTARGHER KING (CONT'D) You gimme liddle worm. \nSTARGHER KING (still speaking as Martin) Shut up cunt. (to the boy) Give it here, worm... \nthe child picks up the blade and stands between them, looking to Catherine for guidance. \nSTARGHER KING (CONT'D) (as Martin) You want a mommy?  Is that what you want? \nIn an almost dream-like motion, the child hands the blade to adult Stargher. \nSTARGHER Enough. \nAnd he DRIVES the thing into Stargher King's heart.  For a brief moment, Martin's face is superimposed over Stargher King's.  Stunned, he slumps and regards adult Stargher with sad, troubled eyes. \nMARTIN (as Stargher King) Why?  What'd I do?... \nStargher TWISTS the handle of the blade and Martin/Stargher King drops dead.   Dead.  Young Stargher smiles and hugs Catherine. \nYOUNG STARGHER Time to go 'way. \nCATHERINE Carl...? \nThe boy runs to adult Stargher who lifts the child into his arms and holds him close. \nYOUNG STARGHER Bye. \nShe looks to adult Stargher and begins to understand.  He descends into the pool, the boy resting his head on his shoulder. \nSTARGHER KING Thank you, Catherine.  You did help me. More than you'll ever know. \nMan and boy disappear beneath the water's surface.  Catherine stands and sees that Stargher King's body has vanished. She walks to the shore and sees, deep underwater, Stargher and little Carl floating lifelessly like women in the cell. And FADE FROM VIEW. \nCATHERINE Goodbye Carl. \nShe presses the sensor in her hand. \nINT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY \nIN THE CONTROL ROOM, Miriam is shocked by what she sees on the monitors and looks at Stargher. \nMIRIAM He's in full arrest. \nCatherine quietly returns to consciousness and is automatically lowered.  She pulls the mask from her face, rises and opens the door.  Miriam races inside and desperately attempts to revive Stargher.  But it's no use. Angry and stunned, she demands of Catherine. \nMIRIAM (CONT'D) Help me! \nBut Catherine chooses not to.  She knows Carl Stargher will never return to the world of the living. \nINT. HELICOPTER - DAY \nThe chopper roars across the sky.  As they head northeast, away from the urban and toward the rural, Novak gazes out the window, trying to stay focused, fighting any after-effects of the drugs.  The pilot communicates via headset. \nPILOT Agent Novak?  Go ahead. \nNOVAK Cole? \nEXT. STARGHER'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nCole and a handful of other agents pour into waiting Suburbans.  (INTERCUT WITH NOVAK IN HELICOPTER). \nCOLE The hoist was manufactured by Carver Industrial Equipment in 1982.  Serial number 117-337J.  Purchased by a boat shop in Lake Havasu, but sold to Lattimer's industrial Supply in 1992... \nINT. THE CELL - DAY \nThe water is near the ceiling.  Kicking her legs to keep afloat, Julia DIGS with the ring and we see she has created a gap between the light fixture housing and an unused PIPE leading to the surface.  She pushes, but can't get anything to move.  The opening will get no bigger.  Julia sucks the last bit of oxygen and swims to the bottom of the cell. Searching for something, she finds a juice box and pulls out the drinking straw. \nAnd is hit hard by the sight of DROWNED JULIA, her motionless body floating past him.  HER EYES OPEN and bubbles drift from her nose and mouth.  Novak BANGS on the Plexiglas and calls to her. \nNOVAK JULIA! \nThe thick Plexiglass still remains, but she now can see him. Novak pulls his ID BADGE and smacks it against the glass. \nNOVAK (CONT'D) MOVE ASIDE! \nHe pulls his gun and takes aim.  Julia swims to the top of the cell and presses herself against the ceiling.  BANG-BANG BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG.  Novak fires a circle of shots into the thick plastic.  Water slowly leaks, but the damn thing is still solid.  He lifts the industrial VCR and RAMS it at the bullet-damaged section.  CRACK! CRASH!  WATER POURS FROM THE CELL.  Julia's body descends on the torrent of water.  Novak reaches inside and pulls her to safety.  He's just about to give her CPR when she coughs, sputters, and thirstily drinks in oxygen.  Holding her tightly, Novak sinks to the floor, the water from the cell spilling everywhere. \nEXT. ABANDONED FARM HOUSE \nCole's Suburban leads a contingent of FBI vehicles and local police cars onto the property, sirens blaring. \nINT. THE CELL - DAY \nHearing the sirens, Novak relaxes.  For the first time in god knows how long, he relaxes.  And holds Julia Hickson as if his life depended on it. \nFADE OUT. \nFADE IN: \nEXT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE - DAY \nTwo cars parked outside.  An old, quirky Volvo and a Land Rover. \nINT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE - DAY \nAs a television plays THE WIZARD OF OZ, we find Catherine watching the movie from the couch, sitting up, drinking a cup of tea.  She looks rested and quite cute in gym shorts and a T-shirt, her CAT sleeping next to her.  IN THE KITCHEN, Miriam packs up her stethoscope and blood pressure monitor, moves into the living room as Dorothy falls asleep in a field of poppies... \nMIRIAM I left the nutritional information on the fridge door.  Read it. \nCatherine nods, but she's more interested in the movie. Miriam deposits prescription bottles onto a side table. \nMIRIAM (CONT'D) I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan... \nCATHERINE I don't need them anymore... \nMIRIAM I know. \nBut she leaves them just the same. \nMIRIAM (CONT'D) I'll come by tomorrow after work.  With dinner. \nCATHERINE Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and... \nMIRIAM ...give a kiss to Edward. \nCATHERINE (overlapping) Give a kiss to Edward. \nThe women exchange smiles and Miriam exits. \nEXT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE \nAs Miriam walks to her Land Rover, she sees a government issue Suburban park on the street and Peter Novak exit. \nMIRIAM Agent Novak. \nNOVAK Dr. Kent. \nMIRIAM You're looking well. \nNOVAK Thanks you.  Six weeks off does a body good. (conspiratorially) I heard she got the approval to try the reversal with Edward. \n", "test1_input": "Catherine detaches the cables and eases Edward's frail body into a waiting wheelchair.  Miriam takes a penlight and examines the boy's eyes... An emotionless void, oddly beautiful. \nMIRIAM (thinking aloud) Nursery rhymes, fairy tales, the bogeyman... All preparation for the horrors of the real world. \nMaking certain the child is comfortable, Catherine covers him with a blanket, rests a teddy bear on his lap, and pushes him into the CONTROL ROOM, accompanied by Miriam.  Henry types in a command and moves to join them. \nHENRY Anybody hungry?  I'm hungry... \nA BUZZER sounds and ANOTHER DOOR HISSES OPEN... A constantly fretting administrator, BARRY COOPERMAN, is waiting for them in the corridor. \nCOOPERMAN Edward's parents are here. \nWe can see it in Catherine's face - this isn't good news. \nEXT. CAMPBELL CENTER - DAY \nSituated in a corporate/industrial area north of San Diego, California, a series of well-secured buildings form a mini compound.  A sign near the gate reads CAMPBELL CENTER - A DIVISION OF SUNERSET INDUSTRIES. \nINT. CAMPBELL CENTER - EDWARD'S ROOM - DAY \nAlthough this is a hospital room filled with medical equipment, its sterility has been camouflaged with toys, posters, photographs, and drawings to make it more \"homey.\" (Some hint at aspects of Edward's fantasy world).  Every comfort has been provided and no expense spared. \nHenry, Miriam, and Catherine, now wearing funky/casual clothes under a lab coat, stand opposite Cooperman.  Sitting on the bed with Edward is ELLA BAINES, an elegantly dressed woman in her mid-40's.  There is a soulfulness to her, but the husband, LUCIEN BAINES, 60's, possesses the icy demeanor of a corporate tycoon.  One might write him off as cold, but we sense a genuine love for his wife and child.  Ella smiles and caresses Edward's hair. \nELLA He needs a haircut. \nCATHERINE I'll tell the nurse. (sensing something in Edward) God, he loves when you visit. \nELLA My husband wonders if that's true. (delivering bad news) He wants to place Edward in a hospital. \nSeeing an unfunded future, Henry's ready to disassociate himself from Miriam and Catherine... \nHENRY There are other applications for the scanner, Mr. Baines... \nLUCIEN I realize that, Henry... (to Miriam) And I know your work, Dr. Kent, is invaluable to this company... \nCATHERINE You don't know about me, though, do you? \nLUCIEN Catherine, we've waited eighteen months for signs of progress... \nCATHERINE There's been progress. \nLUCIEN Yes, but there is no proof the procedure works.  All I have is a belief that your interaction with my son is not a hallucination. \nCatherine is hurt and vulnerable due to exhaustion and the intensity of her experience with Edward, but feels she must defend herself. \nCATHERINE (to Cooperman, Miriam, Henry) You picked me, remember?  And I took the job.  Gladly.  This is the next wave and I want to be part of it... \nCOOPERMAN No one is doubting your ability. \nCATHERINE Then what is it? \nIntrospective and solemn-eyed, Lucien takes a moment, then: \nLUCIEN I've invested millions of dollars in this study... And I've convinced others to do the same.  I suppose I should feel responsible to them, but I don't.  I could care less if they see a profit. I'm responsible to my boy, that's all that matters. (looks her in the eye) You tell me... Am I doing the right thing? \nOFF CATHERINE'S FACE... \nINT. WHITE ROOM - DAY \nAt first, we're not sure where we are or what's happening. It's too bright, the space confining.  As our eyes adjust, we seem to be in a bathroom or shower stall.  We HEAR a WOMAN CRYING and the camera finds ANNE VICKSEY.  Dark circles beneath eyes red and puffy from crying.  Hair wet and ratted. Sweater and pants damp and stained.  Barefoot, she shivers from cold and fear... \nPULL BACK to show more of her surroundings.  The white-tiled 10' x 8' room features a SHOWER HEAD, TOILET, and a push button SPIGOT for drinking water.  Two walls are SOLID, the other two MIRRORED, the glass covered by thick clear plastic. \n", "test1_true": "There is no door. \nA mechanism CLICKS. Then a RUMBLING... Anne seems to know what's coming.  She presses against the wall, removes her arms from the sleeves of the sweater, hunches down, and raises the garment over her head, forming a tent. \nWATER ERUPTS from the shower head.  There is no steam, so this water must be cold.  Shaking, Anne whispers a count to herself - \"One-one thousand, two-one thousand, three...\" and so on.  The spray hits everything in the room - mirror, toilet, floor - and a food wrapper drifts toward the drain. \nANNE Thirty. \nShe peeks up from the tent, but the water has not stopped, and that isn't what she expected.  We hear a soft SUCKING NOISE and a CLICK.  The wrapper rises on a puddle of water. Anne POUNDS her fist on the wall. \nANNE (CONT'D) (angry, scared) THIRTY! \nA puddle forms around her feet and she realizes the drain has somehow been sealed shut.  Her panic intensifies as we hear another CLICK and the water pressure increases. \nINT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY - DAY \nIn the darkened procedure room, Miriam finds Catherine standing between the two suspension devices, alone. \nMIRIAM You okay? \nCatherine turns, nods, and tries to smile.  Has she been crying?  Miriam steps further into the room. \nCATHERINE He hates me. \nMIRIAM Lucien Baines? \nCatherine nods. \nMIRIAM (CONT'D) I wouldn't say \"hates.\"  Dislikes, distrusts, maybe. \nCatherine laughs.  Exactly what Miriam wanted. \nMIRIAM (CONT'D) She adores you. \nCATHERINE She thinks I can bring Edward back. \nMIRIAM Someday you can.  We all believe that... \nCatherine halfheartedly nods, but her mind is elsewhere, focused on the two apparatuses. \nCATHERINE I want to try it.  Please. \nMiriam knows what this is about. \nMIRIAM We've been over this a dozen times.  No. \nCATHERINE Why not?  Just once.  A trial run.  What harm could it do? \nMIRIAM I don't want to find out. \nEver the doctor, Miriam finds herself surreptitiously examining Catherine's eyes, flesh tone, a slight trembling in her fingertips. \nCATHERINE Why is it taking so long for us to reach him?  Because we've been reactive, that's why.  And we need to be active. \nMiriam reaches for Catherine's wrist and takes her pulse. \nCATHERINE (CONT'D) (annoyed) Miriam... \nMIRIAM Shush. \nAs Miriam examines her, Catherine continues: \nCATHERINE He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play. \n", "test2_input": "EXT. STARGHER HOUSE - DAY \nFBI AGENTS and local police cordon off the area. \nINT. STARGHER HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY \nValentine is muzzled and led away as the PARAMEDICS load Stargher onto a stretcher.

I don't want anyone treating him but Reid.  Not so much as a thermometer up his ass.  Understand? \nStockwell nods and follows the stretcher outside.  A stoic Ramsey enters from the living room and Novak can see the disappointment in his eyes. \nRAMSEY She's not here. \nNovak would give anything for that not to be true. \nRAMSEY (CONT'D) (it gets worse) You should come downstairs. \nINT. STARGHER HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY \nRamsey leads Novak into Stargher's \"workroom.\"  It's all here, the table, the piercing supplies, the bleach.  An odd, grisly collection of DOLLS fills cubby holes in a wooden storage/shelf unit.  Novak's eyes are like a camera, documenting and storing as much information as possible, but it's overwhelming. \nHe moves through the basement.  Careful not to touch anything.  He stops and focuses on the hoist and eight hooks situated over the stainless steel table.  (NOTE: ON THE WINCH'S MOTOR IS A WORN PLAQUE READING \"CARVER INDUSTRIAL EQUIPMENT\" with a logo). \nRamsey switches on the video monitor and the screen fills with images of Anne dying in the cell. \nNovak is painfully, tragically drawn to this.  Although he's seen his share of horrific things, Novak is truly disturbed by the sight of Anne, desperate to escape, drowning, slowly dying, and he knows: This is what will happen to Julia Hickson unless he finds her. \nINT. THE CELL - NIGHT \nCLICK.  WATER SPRAYS FROM THE SHOWER.  Caught by surprise, Julia blocks the spray with her hands and searches for a shut off valve.  Of course, there is none.  Thirty seconds later, the water stops.  Like an animal caught in a trap, Julia's eyes dart around her \"cage.\"  What kind of hell is this? Shivering, she catches herself in the mirror and looks deeply into it.  Something's odd about the glass.  Is someone watching her?  She bangs on it with her fist. \nJULIA Hey! \nPOUND, POUND, POUND! \nJULIA (CONT'D) LET ME OUT!!! \nBut there's no response.  Only her reflection. \nINT. KERN COUNTY HOSPITAL - EXAMINATION ROOM - NIGHT \nA HUMAN EYE.  No movement, no deviation of the iris.  A fixed stare.  The catatonic Stargher lies in a hospital bed, wrists cuffed to the frame.  An IV feeds him fluids and monitors report his vital signs.  As a nervous NURSE exits, we see TWO POLICEMEN standing guard in the outer hallway.  Novak, Ramsey and Teddy Lee stand by as the killer is examined by DR. MILTON REID, a brilliant forensic M.D. currently shining an opthalmoscope into Stargher's eyes.  He pulls away and checks the ELECTROENCENPHELOGRAM already on a lightbox. \nREID Minimal activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.  And here, the anterior cingulate cortex. (to Novak and Ramsey) It's what helps distinguish between external and internal stimuli. \nRAMSEY What the hell does that mean? \nTEDDY LEE (answering for Reid) He's schizophrenic. \nNovak doesn't like this.  Not one bit. \nRAMSEY What're you doing here, Reid?  Paving the way for his insanity defense? \nREID No need.  There won't be a trial.  This is no act.  The coma is real. \nRAMSEY Whoa.  Wait a minute. \nREID You ever hear of Whalen's Infraction? \nClearly not. \n", "test2_true": "Novak's worry intensifies. \nREID (CONT'D) Stargher's neurological system was infected by a virus in utero.  It lay dormant.  In his case for about... (guesses at Stargher's age) ...thirty years.  Most likely, he's exhibited symptoms for awhile now, but the infraction - the breach - didn't occur 'til today.  You never know when it'll happen, at what age, or why.  The triggers vary, but the results don't. (fascinated by Stargher) He has no ties to reality.  No awareness of this world or the people in it. \nTEDDY LEE What about Thorazine? Or... Desoxyn? \nREID The normal psychotropics don't work. He's not just catatonic, he's... disappeared.  Like having a dream and never waking up. \nNOVAK This girl.  Julia Hickson.  Only he knows where she is. \nREID Then I'm sorry.  For her and for you. \nNovak is past angry.  He's bordering on devastation.  Ramsey attempts to placate him. \nRAMSEY We'll go back to his house, Pete. There's still a lot to do.  Analyze the videos, track sales of the bleach, go through his records.  Maybe he owns property somewhere. \nNOVAK They're in that fucking thing for forty hours, Gordon.  Four-oh.  He got Julia at seven-thirty last night.  You know what time it is now...?! \nRamsey backs off, knowing his partner is on the verge of really losing it.  Reid thinks perhaps he shouldn't, but sensitive to Novak's pain and anger, mentions it anyway - if only to keep his friend from true hopelessness. \nREID Peter?  This is a longshot.  I mean a real long shot.  You're gonna think I'm crazy... \nEXT. EDWARD'S WORLD - DAY \nThe ship's engine ROARS TO LIFE and the PROPELLER spins through sand. \nCATHERINE (O.S.) It's fixed! \nAT THE TREE TRUNK, Catherine extends her hand and suddenly Edward is there, quite close, reaching out.  Catherine's hand trembles.  The boy is startled. \nCATHERINE (CONT'D) (surprised, to herself) I'm not signalling... \nHer hand tenses and shakes uncontrollably. \nVOICE (O.S.) Sing a song of sixpence... \nCATHERINE (angry, to the heavens) I'm not signalling! \nEdward is frightened by what's happening and runs away. Catherine tries to call out, but her throat constricts, making speech difficult. \nCATHERINE (CONT'D) I'm not... INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY - DAY \nCatherine's face is covered by a cloth floating down from the sky.  The sky is replaced by the ceiling and overhead lights of the LABORATORY, but Miriam's face remains constant.  Now conscious, Catherine finds herself in the lab at the Campbell Center, the suspension device lowering. \nMIRIAM (on intercom) Sing a song of sixpence. \nCATHERINE (hoarse) A pocketful of fucking rye. (worried) What's wrong? \nMIRIAM (cagey) Nothing. \nCATHERINE (disappointed) Why did we stop? \nCooperman appears in the window and explains. \nCOOPERMAN (on intercom) I asked them to. (with gravity) We have a situation. \nINT. CAMPBELL CENTER - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nA SMALL TV SCREEN shows footage of Anne drowning in the cell. Catherine, Cooperman, Henry, and Miriam watch with curiosity, disgust, pity.  Novak and Ramsey flank the portable monitor/VCR, knowing this is a disturbing but powerful tool. There's someone else in the room.  John Tracy.  He cannot watch the video, not again.  Catherine glances at him, uncomfortable with his presence. \nMIRIAM When did he lapse into the coma? \nNOVAK Sometime yesterday morning. \n", "test3_input": "MARTIN What did you do know?  You make a mess? I hate a mess. \nYoung Stargher backs into a corner, fearing what will come. \nMARTIN (CONT'D) Don't lie, now, Carl. \nIN THE CLOSET, Catherine pushes, but the door won't budge. She POUNDS.  IN THE KITCHEN, we hear no sound. \nMARTIN (CONT'D) Remember what I said about liars?  Liars will be punished. \nINT. CLOSET - CONTINUOUS \nCatherine hears the child SCREAM.  But the scream comes from behind and she spins around. \nINT. STARGHER'S WORLD - LIVING ROOM \nYoung Stargher is forced to sit on the lap of an ugly MIDDLE AGED WOMAN barely wearing a man's robe.  On a nearby table are whisky, tumblers, and an ashtray filled with butts. \nWOMAN I got you a present, cutie-pie. \nShe gives him a TOY DOLL.  Drunk, she hugs and kisses him. Embarrassed, the boy tries to squirm away. \nWOMAN (CONT'D) Oh no.  You're not going anywhere. \nMartin enters and sneers at the boy. \nMARTIN Go back to bed, worm. \nWOMAN It's okay, we was just. \nMARTIN Shut up, cunt. \nThe woman cowers, familiar with his violent moods.  The boy hurries to his room, but Martin grabs him by the collar. \nMARTIN (CONT'D) What is that? \nHe pulls the doll from the child's hands, turns to the woman, and SMACKS her across the face with it, gashing her cheek. \nMARTIN (CONT'D) You give him nothing.  Whore.  Are you his mother?  ARE YOU? \nTerrified, she shakes her head \"no.\"  Martin sees Young Stargher quietly crawling away, hoping to escape. Martin lifts the boy off the floor with one hand and holds him in front of the woman. \nMARTIN (CONT'D) You see that?  SEE IT?  You slithered out one of them.  But where is she now, Carl?  As far from you as she could get, that's where. (shoves him at the woman) You want a mommy?  Is that what you want? \nThe poor boy trembles with fear.  And Martin notices a puddle of urine on the floor.  He drops the boy and laughs. \nMARTIN (CONT'D) Little worm pissed his pants. \nHumiliated, Carl covers himself and hides in a corner. Martin and the woman LAUGH AND LAUGH, delighting in the boy's humiliation. \nINT. CLOSET \nFeeling the boy's shame, Catherine turns and finds a FADED POSTCARD taped to the wall. \nINT. STARGHER'S WORLD - BEDROOM \nMartin has discovered his son's secret hiding place - a camouflaged corner of the attic.  Arranged in deliberate, artistic fashion are scavenged DOLLS.  Heads, limbs and torsos held together with twine, tape and wire.  Some wrapped in filthy plastic.  Faded photographs (including one of his MOTHER), mementos, and most disturbingly, the feathers and bones of dead birds, insect carcasses, and dissected, desiccated mice.  There's something peculiarly beautiful here, but Martin doesn't see it.  Not at all. \nMARTIN Only girls play with dolls... \nHe turns and we see Carl is bound to a wooden support beam, a piece of tape covering his mouth.  The boy is stripped to the waste, barely conscious, face streaked with tears and sweat. \nMARTIN (CONT'D) What kind of thing are you? \n", "test3_true": "A WEIRD NOISE snaps Catherine back to \"reality.\"  She turns just as a door opens behind her.  Responding to the \"invitation,\" she moves through it. \nINT. STARGHER'S WORLD - BATHROOM \nThe adult Carl Stargher sits at the edge of the tub, his back to us, smoking a cigarette.  A white German Shepherd PUPPY clicks across the tile floor and YIPS at Catherine.  She again hears the WEIRD NOISE.  A STAINLESS STEEL BOWL wobbles as Stargher's bloody rubber-gloved hands fill it with something.  Stargher knows she's there and isn't surprised by her presence, but he's not sure what to make of her.  What to do with her.  He rises and walks past her to the sink.  He pulls off the gloves and washes his hands, glancing at her in the mirror. \nCatherine cannot resist looking in the tub.  She sees a dead girl, her torso sliced open.  Disgusted and mortified, she pulls back. \nSTARGHER (O.S.) She was the first... \nShe turns, and Stargher is no longer at the sink. \nSTARGHER (O.S.) (CONT'D) Didn't know what I was doing... \nShe turns, where's this voice coming from?!  She steps back. \nSTARGHER (O.S.) (CONT'D) Be careful... \nThe bumps into the stainless steel bowl and it topples to the floor, spilling its contents of human organs.  Wobble-wobble wobble.  The bowl makes its now-familiar noise. \nSTARGHER (O.S.) (CONT'D) What did you do now?  You make a mess? \nAnd she can see him coming out of the shadows.  Catherine backs into a corner, fearing what will come. \nSTARGHER (CONT'D) I hate a mess. \nStargher steps into a pool of light, shooshes the puppy into the hall, shuts the bathroom door, and looks right at Catherine. \nSTARGHER (CONT'D) Why are you here? \nGod almighty, what does she say?  What does she tell him?! \nSTARGHER (CONT'D) Don't lie, now... \nSCRITCH-SCRITCH-SCRITCH.  The puppy scratches at the door and whimpers, but Stargher's not about to let him back in. Moving slowly, carefully, he approaches Catherine. \nSTARGHER (CONT'D) Liars will be punished. \nCatherine makes a break for the door.  \"Playfully,\" Stargher makes a half-hearted attempt to block her, but she evades him and reaches for the knob.  But the door's not there.  SCRITCH SCRITCH-SCRITCH.  She can still hear the dog, but there's no damn door.  She turns: \nNo door.  No window.  The girl's body and bloody remains have vanished.  An OVERHEAD LIGHT flickers on, giving the room the look and feel of the cell. \nSTARGHER (O.S.) (CONT'D) Where do you think you're going? \nCatherine turns, back to the wall, calm and intimidating, Stargher stands in the center regarding her with great curiosity.  Catherine's ready to press the sensor. \nSTARGHER (CONT'D) Don't do that. \nShe hesitates. \nSTARGHER (CONT'D) If you go away, you'll never find her. \nHow did he know? \nSTARGHER (CONT'D) If you never find her, she dies.  Like the rest. \nCatherine stops and listens.  She can't leave now.  The path to Julia has appeared. \nSTARGHER (CONT'D) I mean, that's why you're here, right? Why you came to my happy little home? \nHe reaches for her and she flinches.  Expecting such behavior, Stargher grins. \nSTARGHER (CONT'D) You're pretty.  A pretty, pretty thing. \n"}

{"test1_input": "JEROME (VO) Of course, there was nothing wrong with me. Not so long ago I would have been considered a perfectly healthy, normal baby.  Ten fingers, ten toes.  That was all that used to matter. But now my immediate well-being was not the sole concern. \nAntonio turns his attention from his baby to the data appearing on the monitor.  We see individual items highlighted amongst the data - \"NERVE CONDITION - PROBABILITY 60%\", \"MANIC DEPRESSION - 42%\", \"OBESITY - 66%\", \"ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDER - 89%\"-- \nJEROME (VO) My destiny was mapped out before me-- all my flaws, predispositions and susceptibilities - most untreatable to this day.  Only minutes old, the date and cause of my death was already known. \nAntonio focuses on a final highlighted item on the monitor's screen, \"HEART DISORDER - 99% - EARLY FATAL POTENTIAL.\". \"LIFE EXPECTANCY - 33 YEARS\". \nNURSE The name? (typing details into birth certificate) For the certificate. \nMARIA Antonio-- \nANTONIO (correcting her) --No, Vincent Antonio. \nWith a computer stylus he signs the nurse's handheld screen. \nEXT.  TRACT HOME - BACKYARD.  DAY. \n2-YEAR-OLD JEROME (REFERRED TO BY HIS GIVEN NAME OF \"VINCENT\" FOR MOST OF THE FOLLOWING FLASHBACK) running with a toy rocket falls more in clumsiness than fatigue.  MARIA suddenly whisks up the toddler. \nMARIA (hysterical) Oh, Vincent, Vincent, Vincent...I can't let you out of my sight. \nMaria frantically listens to her young son's heartbeat.  For his part, Vincent appears surprised by the attention.  Maria places a portable oxygen mask over Vincent's mouth. \nJEROME (VO) I was born Vincent Antonio Luca.  And from an early age I came to think of myself as others thought of me - chronically ill. Every skinned knee and runny nose treated as if it were life-threatening. \nINT.  DAY CARE CENTER.  DAY. \nMARIA and ANTONIO drop off dark-haired 2-YEAR-OLD VINCENT at a Day Care Center. \nJEROME (VO) And my parents soon realized that wherever I went, my genetic prophecy preceded me. \nWhile HEALTHY CHILDREN play outside on tricycles, clamber over jungle-gyms and finger-paint, the PRE-SCHOOL TEACHER shows Vincent into a room where CHILDREN WITH OBVIOUS DISABILITIES sleep on mats. \nMaria wheels around and marches out of the center with Vincent in her arms.  Antonio follows close behind, pleading with his wife to see sense. \nJEROME (VO) They put off having any more children until they could afford not to gamble - to bring a child into the world in what has become the \"natural\" way. \nEXT.  HOME.  DAY. \nANTONIO reluctantly shows off his spotless Buick Riviera to a prospective BUYER. \nJEROME (VO) It meant selling the beloved Buick. \nThe two men haggle over the price while MARIA, holding VINCENT in her arms, looks on.  Finally money and a pink slip are exchanged. \nVINCENT (VO) My father got a good price.  After all, the only accident he'd ever had in that car was me. \nAs the BUYER drives away, Antonio shrugs to Maria to hide his disappointment. \nEXT.  GENETIC COUNSELLING OFFICE BUILDING.  DAY. \nANTONIO, MARIA and 2-YEAR-OLD VINCENT exit a packed commuter bus and enter a Genetic Counselling office building bearing the sign - \"PRO-CREATION\". \nINT.  GENETIC COUNSELLING OFFICE.  DAY. \nA GENETICIST stares into a high-powered microscope as ANTONIO, MARIA and 2-YEAR-OLD VINCENT are shown into the office by a NURSE.  On the counter beside the Geneticist is a glass-doored industrial refrigerator containing petri dishes arranged on racks several feet high. \nGENETICIST (to the nurse, without taking his eyes from his binocular microscope) Put up the dish. \nWhile Antonio and Maria take a seat in front of a television monitor, the Nurse puts a labelled petri dish under a video- equipped microscope.  The Geneticist swings around in his chair to greet his clients. \nFour magnified clusters of cells - eight cells on each cluster - appear on the television screen. \nGENETICIST Your extracted eggs... (noting the couple's names from data along the edge of the screen) ...Maria, have been fertilized with... Antonio's sperm and we have performed an analysis of the resulting pre-embryos. After screening we're left with two healthy boys and two healthy girls.  Naturally, no critical pre-dispositions to any of the major inheritable diseases.  All that remains is to select the most compatible candidate. \nMaria and Antonio exchange a nervous smile. \n", "test1_true": "MARIA (referring to the toddler on her knee) We would like Vincent to have a brother... you know, to play with. \nThe Geneticist nods.  He scans the data around the edge of the screen. \nGENETICIST You've already specified blue eyes, dark hair and fair skin.  I have taken the liberty of eradicating any potentially prejudicial conditions - premature baldness, myopia, alcoholism and addictive susceptibility, propensity for violence and obesity-- \nMARIA (interrupting, anxious) --We didn't want--diseases, yes. \nANTONIO (more diplomatic) We were wondering if we should leave some things to chance. \nGENETICIST (reassuring) You want to give your child the best possible start.  Believe me, we have enough imperfection built-in already.  Your child doesn't need any additional burdens.  And keep in mind, this child is still you, simply the best of you. You could conceive naturally a thousand times and never get such a result. \nANTONIO (squeezing Maria's hand) He's right, Maria.  That's right. \nMaria is only half-convinced, but the Geneticist swiftly moves on. \nGENETICIST Is there any reason you'd want a left-handed child? \nANTONIO (blank) Er, no... \nGENETICIST (explaining) Some believe it is associated with creativity, although there's no evidence.  Also for sports like baseball it can be an advantage. \nANTONIO (shrugs) I like football. \nGENETICIST (injecting a note of levity) I have to warn you, Mr Luca, he's going to be at least a head taller than you. Prepare for a crick in the neck in sixteen years time. \nAntonio beams proudly. \nGENETICIST (scanning the data on the screen) Anything I've forgotten? \nMARIA (hesitant about broaching the subject) We want him--we were hoping he would get married and have children.  We'd like grandchildren. \nGENETICIST (conspiratorial smile) I understand.  That's already been taken care of. (an afterthought) Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have at my disposal but for a little extra...I could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability. \nMARIA (suddenly enthused) Antonio, the choir... \nGENETICIST (interjecting, covering himself) I have to caution you it's not fool-proof. With multi-gene traits there can be no guarantees. \nANTONIO How much extra? \nGENETICIST It would be five thousand more. \nAntonio's face falls. \nANTONIO I'm sorry, there's no way we can. \nGENETICIST Don't worry.  You'll probably do just as well singing to him in the womb. (rising to end the appointment) We can implant the most successful pre-embryo tomorrow afternoon. \nMaria is staring at the four magnified clumps on the screen. \nMARIA What will happen to the others? \nGENETICIST (reassuring) They are not babies, Maria, merely \"human possibilities\". \nRemoving the petri dish from beneath the lens of the microscope, he points out the four minuscule specks. \nGENETICIST Smaller than a grain of sand. \nDISSOLVE TO \nINT.  TRACT HOME.  DAY. \nA red pencil draws a mark on a doorway at the height of a child's head.  The child moves away and the name, \"ANTON 11\" is written beside the mark by proud father, ANTONIO. \nJEROME (VO) That's how my brother, Anton, came into the world - a son my father considered worthy of his name. \n", "test1_id": 3018, "test2_input": "EXT.  STREET OUTSIDE A BAR.  DAY. \nEUGENE, glassy-eyed, strides out of a bar, past camera and into the street.  We hear a squeal of brakes and a sickening thud. \nINT.  HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT.  DAY. \nEUGENE awakens with a scream, bathed in sweat, arms bound to a bed - the only real piece of furniture in the room.  VINCENT, sitting on a crate beside him, soaking a towel in a bowl of water, is taken by surprise.  Eugene continues to scream and thrash, fighting against his bindings.  Vincent stuffs the towel into Eugene's mouth and holds onto his arms. \nJEROME (VO) I confess, at first I wondered if I had rescued a man who was already dead. \nINT.  HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT - BATHROOM.  NIGHT. \nVINCENT holds EUGENE's head over the toilet bowl as he vomits violently.  Eugene's paralysis and Vincent's broken legs make the operation doubly difficult. \nFinally Eugene has nothing left in his stomach to vomit.  He drops to the floor in exhaustion.  Vincent, also exhausted from the effort of holding Eugene over the bowl, joins him on the broken linoleum.  Both men stare up at the ceiling that carries a map of the constellation. \nVINCENT You okay, Jerome? \nEUGENE (ironically referring to their mutual immobility) Yeah.  You want to go dancing tonight? \nVincent smiles. \nINT.  HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT.  NIGHT. \nEUGENE turns his nose up at the plate of boiled meat and potatoes that VINCENT puts in front of him.  Vincent catches the look. \nVINCENT What's wrong with it? \nEUGENE I think I'd better choose the menu.  After all, you're learning how to be me, I'm not learning how to be you. \nVINCENT (shrugs) Suit yourself. \nEUGENE (trying to be more diplomatic) Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him? \nVINCENT German. \nEUGENE You're both going to a lot of trouble-- (trying to be tactful) Maybe you can con somebody into believing you're me to get your foot in the door--but once you're inside, you're on your own.  I'm sure you're sincere... (glancing to the space paraphenalia) ...but I was being groomed for something like this myself.  Even without the accident I don't think I would have made it.  My point is--how the hell do you expect to pull this off? \nJerome merely stares back as if the thought of failure has never occurred to him. \nVINCENT (shrugs and states it simply) I don't know exactly, Jerome. \nEUGENE (laughing) At least you're honest. (a thought occurs) Call me by my middle name--Eugene--If you're going to be Jerome, you may as well start getting used to it. \nNB:  FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE SCREENPLAY \"VINCENT\" IS REFERRED TO AS \"JEROME\". \nINT. HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT.  NIGHT. \nJEROME looks through Eugene's personal effects, including a photograph album.  He is drawn to a swimming medal inside the album at a page displaying a photo of a wealthy, austere MOTHER - Eugene evidently comes from money. \nEven as he wheels into the room in his rickety wheelchair we see that EUGENE has the bearing of someone of good breeding.  He has a bag of blood on his lap.  More blood is being drawn from his arm through an IV.  Eugene catches Jerome looking at the album. \nJEROME (guiltily closing the book) I have to know where you come from. \nEUGENE If anybody asks, tell them the truth-- your family disowns you.  You are a disappointment, Jerome. \nJEROME (referring to Eugene's medal, impressed) What about this? \nEUGENE Wrong color.  It's silver. (tossing the bag of blood to Jerome) It's not easy living up to this. \nEugene wheels away. \nINT.  HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT.  DAY. \nJEROME practises writing with his right hand, trying to replicate Eugene's signature. \nEUGENE (wheeling by, looking over Jerome's shoulder at the signature) It needs work. \n", "test2_true": "EUGENE Noone orders southpaws anymore. \nINT.  HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT.  DAY. \nA pair of spectacles lie on the bed.  JEROME, still wearing his twin casts, sits behind an optometrist's portable examining device.  GERMAN hovering in the background, an OPTOMETRIST custom-fits JEROME with gossamer thin contact lenses. \nJEROME (VO) Myopia is a dead giveaway - one of the earliest and most justifiable of the quality-of-life corrections.  Anybody with impaired vision is certain to be suffering from all the other deficiencies of a \"nonadvantaged\" birth. \nGERMAN (inspecting the lens in Jerome's eye) It's no good.  I can see an edge.  He may as well walk in there with a cane. \nINT.  HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT.  DAY. \nThe Optometrist has been replaced in the living room with a BLACK MARKET DENTIST who bonds JEROME's small, gapped teeth to match EUGENE's perfectly straight, white picket fences. \nINT.  HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT.  DAY. \nHair already bleached and cut to match Eugene's hairstyle, JEROME sits in a chair against a hastily erected white paper backdrop.  From his wheelchair, EUGENE puts the finishing touches to Jerome's hair.  He wheels himself out of the way. The final accomplice in Jerome's deception, a BLACK MARKET COMPUTER GRAPHICS DESIGNER, takes Jerome's photo with a video camera.  Manipulating the captured image, the Designer morphs Jerome's face into the face of Eugene.  The resulting photo that spits out of a printer is neither one nor the other but an acceptable combination of the two. \nINT.  HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT.  DAY. \nEUGENE is starting to prepare Jerome's specimen bags for the first time.  He winces in pain as he plucks several hairs from his head.  JEROME, now out of his casts, prepares job applications. \nEUGENE (still grimacing, referring to the follicles) You really need that much? \nJEROME More than that.  You'll get used to it. \nEUGENE (yanking out another hair) God, what wouldn't you do to leave the planet? \nJEROME (inspecting a hair follicle) Leave?  Just a few million years ago every atom in this hair--in our bodies--was a part of a star. I don't see it as leaving.  I see it as going home. \nEUGENE (marvelling at Jerome's earnestness) God, you're serious, aren't you? \nJerome ignores him.  Having learnt his lesson, he hands the envelopes to EUGENE to lick the flaps. \nINT.  HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT.  DAY. \nJEROME is doing a late-minute cram on a geriatric computer from the late 1990's.  Checking the time, Jerome hurriedly picks up the shirt that EUGENE has been ironing from a prone position on the floor. \nJEROME It's not too late to back out. \nEUGENE You don't know what a relief it is not to be me.  Are you sure you want the job? \nJerome contemplates the question for a moment. \nJEROME What about you?  What's in this for you, Eugene? \nEUGENE (referring to the bladder bag he wears) Listen, I bag this stuff anyway.  It may as well pay my rent. \nJerome hurrise to the bathroom where, with some difficulty, he inserts his urine device for the first time.  The new improved Jerome emerges into the living room ready for his interview. \nINT.  GATTACA CORPORATION - TESTING LAB.  DAY. \nJEROME emerges from a bathroom and hands a TECHNICIAN his plastic cup full of fraudulent urine and inserts it into the analyzer. \nTECHNICIAN (reading off the profile) Congratulations. \nJEROME (perplexed) What about the interview? \nTECHNICIAN (referring to the cup) That was it. \nEXT.  GATTACA.  DAY. \nJEROME, scarcely able to disguise his delight, exits Gattaca, trying not to stare at the superb specimens who are now his \"colleagues\". \nJEROME (VO) The majority of people are now made-to-order. What began as a means to rid society of inheritable diseases has become a way to design your offspring--the line between health and enhancement blurred forever.  Eyes can always be brighter, a voice purer, a mind sharper, a body stronger, a life longer.  Everyone seeks to give their child the best chance but the most skilled geneticists are only accessible to the priveleged few. \n", "test2_id": 3019, "test3_input": "EUGENE Where are we going? \nJEROME (slightly guilty) I'm sorry.  I've got plans. \nEUGENE (feigning hurt) Again? \nJEROME (referring to his bandage) She's already got her doubts.  I have to act like nothing's wrong. \nEUGENE I'm sure you'll be very convincing. \nJerome ignores the remark. \nEUGENE Where are you taking her? \nJEROME Michael's. \nEugene looks at him askance. \nJEROME Everybody goes there. \nEUGENE (incredulous, glancing around the room) You may as well invite her here. \nJEROME (afterthought as he picks up his jacket) Will you be okay? \nEUGENE Don't worry about your little pin cushion. To be honest, I'm looking forward to having the place to myself. \nJEROME (seeing through the bravado) We'll still be able to talk when I'm away. The conversation will just keep getting longer. \nEUGENE How long? \nJEROME By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and say, \"How are you?\"  Forty-five minutes later I reply, \"Not bad.  How are you?\" \nEUGENE I guess I'd better have something important to say if it takes that long to get an answer. \nINT.  MICHAEL'S CLUB.  NIGHT. \nIRENE and JEROME step off the dance floor of the smoky, decadent dinner club and take a seat at their table.  Irene is agog at the strange assortment of PATRONS, the cigars, the laden dessert trolleys.  It is all slightly off from the pristine world she is accustomed to. \nIRENE What is this place? \nJEROME (wry smile, enjoying her fascination) You've never been here? (a dessert trolley is wheeled up) Let me order for you. \nJerome selects a chocolate torte from the trolley.  Jerome savors a spoonful.  Irene is tempted but then remembers herself. \nIRENE I'd better not. \nShe reaches for her elegant pill box.  Jerome takes another spoonful. \nJEROME So sure of what you can't do.  Do you even know what it tastes like, Irene? \nIrene goes to deny it but cannot. \nMICHAEL suddenly approaches the table with a WAITER in tow. Irene is about to steal a taste of the dessert with her finger when their plates and glasses are whisked away and the table immediately hoovered.  Michael whispers in Jerome's ear. \nMICHAEL Take the side door. \nJerome looks up in time to see DETECTIVE HUGO coming through the front entrance with several other DETECTIVES. \nDETECTIVE (to his colleagues) Check for lenses, hairpieces-- \nA Detective shines a flashlight in the eyes of a MALE PATRON. A SECOND DETECTIVE tugs the hair of a SECOND PATRON.  Jerome takes Irene by the hand and escorts her out of the side exit. Several other COUPLES make for the parking lot. \nIRENE Why are we leaving? \nJEROME (attempting to explain the hasty exit) Those checks take forever. \nEXT.  MICHAEL'S CLUB - SIDE ALLEY.  NIGHT. \n", "test3_true": "IRENE (stunned) Jerome! \nSpying other Detectives some distance away in the parking lot. Jerome leads Irene out of a hidden side gate. \nIRENE What about the car? \nJEROME (grabbing her by the hand) Let's walk. \nIRENE Who are they? \nJEROME (holding his bruised knuckles) It's not safe.  I shouldn't have brought you here. \nJerome drags Irene across a vast, desolate lot, lit only by moonlight.  Feeling exposed, he breaks into a run. \nIRENE I can't. \nJEROME (anxious) Come on. \nIRENE My medication.  I left it back there. \nJEROME We'll get it later. (forcing her to look him in the eye) Irene, please. \nIrene realizes his seriousness.  She begins to run with him. The clearing is wider than Jerome anticipated.  They are only halfway across - extremely vulnerable if the Detective think yo look in their direction. \nINT.  MICHAEL'S.  NIGHT. \nThe INVESTIGATOR is grilling MICHAEL, the club's owner.  The investigator suspiciously regards the multitude of mini-vacs in the kitchen and the incinerator burning the refuse. \nINVESTIGATOR (an accusing tone) You run a clean establishment. \nMICHAEL Are you a health inspector? \nINVESTIGATOR (showing Vincent's mugshot) Do you recognize this man? \nMICHAEL My eyes aren't so good. \nINVESTIGATOR I bet. \nHugo calls out from the side door where he has discovered his fallen colleague. \nHUGO Sir. \nThe Investigator hurries to him. \nINVESTIGATOR (to the still dazed Detective, examining his injuries) Did he hit you with his fist? \nDETECTIVE (head in his hands) More like a hammer. \nINVESTIGATOR (reprimanding the beaten Detective) Don't touch your face.  Don't swallow. Don't spit. (to Hugo) Quick, clean his teeth. \nHugo uses a flashlight and a small dental-like implement to try to pick skin from Jerome's knuckles from between the Detective's teeth.  The Investigator finds the hidden side door. \nEXT.  DESOLATE LOT.  NIGHT. \nJEROME and IRENE continue to sprint across the enormous vacant lot in the moonlight, splashing through deposits of mud and water.  Just as the gate opens in the distance, Jerome hurls Irene into the safety of the undergrowth on the other side. Irene, out of breath, desperately feels for her pulse. \nIRENE (upset, a strangled protest) Are you trying to kill me?  Are you?! Don't you understand, I can't do that! \nJerome tenderly removes Irene's hand from her pulse. \nJEROME You just did. \nIrene looks back across the vast clearing they have just negotiated, realizing what she has just done. \nFrom across the other side of the clearing comes an echoing cry from the center FIGURE. \n", "test3_id": 3020}

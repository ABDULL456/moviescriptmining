GILL (dismayed) Maggie? 
MAGGIE (admitting) I'm really, really afraid of needles... It doesn't make me a bad person. 
Ike laughs.  Maggie looks at him with rage.  Gill dramatically pulls down the front of his t-shirt. 
GILL Look. 
There it is on Gill's chest: the rose tattoo.  Maggie sighs, pained.  Gill shows it to Ike.  Ike looks at the tattoo.  He shakes his head at Maggie. 
IKE (sincerely) Look, look, man.  I think the man is heartbroken. 
MAGGIE He is not! 
Maggie moves the lever on the wall again, sending Ike back up to the ceiling in the car.  She grabs the photo from Ike and exits. 
GILL I think I am. 
Gill grabs his guitar and sits. 
GILL (cont'd) Hey, Ike, what would Jerry do? 
The hydraulic lift stops moving.  Ike leans out. 
IKE Jerry.  He'd play.  He'd play... Jerry would play his heart out. 
Ike sings and taps along in tempo on the side of the car as Gill sings and plays "Ripple". 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HOTEL PORCH - NEXT DAY, SATURDAY MORNING 
As Maggie drives into town with Peggy, they see Ike on porch with SHERIFF, POLICE CHIEF and MAIL    MAN, all playing instruments as a blues band.  Ike is not bad on slide guitar.  They all like Ike. 
Maggie "CHUFFAS" with Peggy and moves on. 
EXT. SOFTBALL FIELD - LATER THAT DAY 
CLOSE ON: 
The slow, loopy pitch of a softball.  A bat connects. 
NEW ANGLE: 
A big wholesome man, CORY, runs for first base.  He just beats out the throw.  Bob, acting as umpire, yells, "Safe!"  Happy, Cory turns to the stands and waves. 
ANGLE ON: 
Maggie and Peggy, cheering loudly.  Peggy tries to whoop harder than Maggie, but that would be tough.  From firs base, Cory waves back to them.  The two women sit back down and Maggie takes back up with their conversation.  Maggie is still al steamed up. 
MAGGIE Okay, he's on base.  Can we talk about my life now?  -- Ike's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- that I was never serious about Gill, blah blah.  He's totally out to get me. 
PEGGY For what reason?  Some personal satisfaction? 
MAGGIE That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot. 
PEGGY It's probably because you got him fired. 
MAGGIE (sarcastic) Ya think? 
PEGGY Not that he doesn't deserve to get fired... Look!  Cory's going for second!... Sneaky! 
ANGLE ON: 
Cory as he runs for second base and with a slide beats the throw for the force out.  The women jump and cheer -- Maggie, again, the most boisterous. 
ANGLE ON: 
Dennis recognizes Ike as he walks up.  Dennis tells Ike that he is going to marry Maggie some day and shows Ike where Maggie is sitting. 
ANGLE ON: 
Maggie spots Ike as they sit back down.  She groans. 
MAGGIE There he is.  Snoop Doggy-Dogg. 
PEGGY Where? 
MAGGIE Over there.  Ten o'clock.  He's talking to our little Dennis.  Dennis will turn into one of those "sources say" things. 
PEGGY He looks better with that stuff out of his hair.  He's an attractive man. 
Ike finds Maggie in the crowd and leaves Dennis. 
MAGGIE I'd say you've been in the sun too long. You handle him, okay?  I could use five minutes off from that creep. 
Before Peggy can protest, Maggie climbs down off the bleachers and goes and stands near the dugout near the rest of Cory's team.

When E.T hears the sound, his red heart lights up. The homing signal reverberates in his chest. 
[This establishes that his heart is used as a communication device, i.e., these aliens communicate with their hearts.] 
"Keys" hears this sound and quickly turns around. He points his flashlight towards the sounds. The other men join him as they walk towards the sound. E.T. screams and runs away, which is indicated by the shaking bushes. The men with flashlights chase after him. 
[So, like Dorothy in the WIZARD OF OZ, the opening scene has the protagonist being pursued by an unknown antagonist.] 
EXT: SPACECRAFT: NIGHT 
The lights dim on the footings of the spacecraft, presumably because the spacecraft is preparing to takeoff. 
[The protagonist has the added jeopardy of being abandoned.] 
EXT: FOREST: NIGHT 
E.T. screams as he races for the spacecraft. The glow from his red-heart reflects off the bushes as he runs towards the white light of the spacecraft. 
[The audience still hasn't seen the face of the protagonist.] 
EXT: SPACECRAFT: NIGHT 
A lone alien stands before a large round white light, as he signals for the other aliens to return to the ship. 
EXT: FOREST: NIGHT 
Men with flashlights run through the forest, as they pursue the red glowing light racing towards the spacecraft. One of the pursuers is the man wearing the keys on his waist. 
EXT: SPACECRAFT: NIGHT 
The grated gangplank lifts up, blocking the entrance to the ship. Behind the grate stands the alien against the large round white light. The red light of the aliens heart lights up as he stands behind the barrier. 
[This image exhibits an obstacle to E.T. returning to his ship.]

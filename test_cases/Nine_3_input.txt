LILLI That I would pay to see. 
GUIDO Luisa was in that film. 
LILLI She was the best thing in the movie. 
GUIDO It's true.   It was your first part. 
CARDINAL'S SECRETARY Of course! - you're Luisa Acari! Oh my Lord! 
LUISA I was. 
Music begins. 
CARDINAL'S SECRETARY You can't stop being somebody. 
LUISA Can't you? p. 52 
CARDINAL'S SECRETARY Well there's a good catholic wife for you, Guido, that's what they do - sacrifice. Still, Signora Contini, it must be a very exciting life for you... 
Luisa looks to Guido.   Close up on Guido. 
FANTASY: 
INT. "SOUNDSTAGE" 
The restaurant table as well as the production team are transplanted onto Guido's unfinished set. They are surrounded by camera equipment, standing lighting units, etc. Luisa rises from her chair, distancing herself from the scene. The other characters, with the exception of Guido, freeze in a dimly lit macabre tableau. 
Luisa contemplates her life with Guido. 
LUISA MY HUSBAND MAKES MOVIES TO MAKE THEM HE LIVES A KIND OF DREAM IN WHICH HIS ACTIONS AREN'T ALWAYS WHAT THEY SEEM- HE MAY BE ON TO SOME UNIQUE ROMANTIC THEME. SOME MEN RUN BANKS SOME RULE THE WORLD SOME EARN THEIR LIVING BAKING BREAD. MY HUSBAND.... HE GOES A LITTLE CRAZY MAKING MOVIES INSTEAD. MY HUSBAND SPINS FANTASIES, HE LIVES THEM, THEN GIVES THEM TO YOU ALL LIKE MICHELANGELO, HE PAINTS HIS PRIVATE DOME BUT CAN'T DISTINGUISH WHAT'S HIS WORK AND WHAT'S HIS HOME. SOME MEN SELL STOCKS SOME MEN PUNCH CLOCKS SOME LEAP WHERE OTHERS FEAR TO TREAD. MY HUSBAND, AS AUTHOR AND DIRECTOR, MAKES UP STORIES IN HIS HEAD. 
As the number progresses, the world around Luisa disappears into a black void, leaving only herself, with Guido in the shadows. Luisa climbs the staircase. 
LUISA (CONT'D) GUIDO CONTINI, LUISA CONTINI: NUMBER ONE GENIUS AND NUMBER ONE FAN. (MORE) p. 53 
LUISA (CONT'D) GUIDO CONTINI, LUISA CONTINI: PASSIONATE WOMAN IN LOVE WITH THIS MAN LONG AGO - MANY YEARS AGO.

MEMORY: 
INT. INSERT STAGE - DAY 
Luisa's screen test for Guido. A work print in scratched black and white. The music continues. 
CLAPPER LOADER (O.S.) Signorina Acari, per favore. Provino numero uno. Luisa Acari. 
The clapper board. TITLE: IL VICOLO (The Alley)    Her name: LUISA ACARI. 
A small set. A couple of tables and chairs, as if it's an outdoor cafe in Piazza Navona.   Luisa enters, younger, she's like Audrey Hepburn... 
Luisa sits on the chair. 
GUIDO (O.S.) Your name, it's Italian. 
LUISA My father's Italian. My mother's French. 
GUIDO (O.S.) What have you done before? 
LUISA (eyes twinkling) Oh, I've waited... 
GUIDO (O.S.) Waited? For this? 
LUISA Waited tables. (they both laugh) And, of course, I studied theatre and mime in Paris. But, mostly waited tables. p. 54

Men get out of a parked car as Mary drives away. They take suitcases out of a second car, then walk up the driveway to Elliott's house. 
EXT: FOREST: NIGHT 
Elliott watches the treetops sway. He scratches his face, as does E.T. Together they stare at the stars. The wind causes the branch to sway, which then pulls the rope, which, in turn, pulls a fork across the saw blade. This drags the nails in the hanger across the flat surface of the blade, and sends signals out into space. Elliott is overjoyed and shouts that it works, while E.T. repeats the word "Home." Together they gaze up to the stars. 
[They have accomplished their objective of sending a message into space. Now, they wait to receive a signal back.] 
INT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: NIGHT 
The light from a flashlight crosses in front of a pumpkin's face. More light floods through the slits of Gertie's door. A hand holding a flashlight opens Gertie's door, and shines the light into the face of a black doll. 
[This has an irritating and frightening effect on anyone in the audience who has ever had the experience of having a light shined into their face.] 
Light from the flashlight searches around Gertie's room. 
INT: HALLWAY: NIGHT 
A pile of yellow electrical cord is stacked on the floor near a chair. It slowly unwinds as it is pulled by someone in Elliott's room. The door to Elliott's room is shut, with a poster sign hanging on it saying "DO NOT ENTER." The silhouette of a man passes behind the door, as sounds of a Geiger counter filter into the air. Muffled voices are heard as the cord is pulled to its fullest extent. It forces a chair to slam against the wall. 
[This last action has a jarring effect on the audience. Emotionally, the audience is outraged at the invasion of the children's rooms, and this creates hatred for the antagonist and his cohorts. They are still faceless so the audience can project the face of the persons they most hate onto these characters. This personalizes the story for them and gets them more intensely involved on an emotional basis. They also become intellectually involved, because the sounds of the Geiger counter and the extension of the cord to its maximum length forces them to infer that the antagonist has found E.T.'s "home" in the closet. This involves the audience in the story much more than if the filmmaker had shown the antagonist poking around in the closet.] 
EXT: FOREST: NIGHT 
"We have to go now E.T. It's so late already," Elliott says as both he and E.T. sadly gaze into the sky. 
[Their objective of receiving a return signal has not been achieved. Their sadness at failure creates empathy for them in the audience.] 
Elliott coughs from being out in the cold, damp air. 
[This is a setup for the later scenes when both Elliott and E.T. are deathly ill.] 
Elliott repeats that they really have to go home, but E.T. ignores him and has a sad expression on his face as he stares up to the sky. Elliott tells them that he has to give them some time. E.T. responds by saying "ouch," signifying that he feels pain. A small fawn watches them from a distance.

BOBBY You don't need numbers.  That's why it's expensive.  Look at the gold. 
Darrell doubts that, shake his head. 
DARRELL ...got no day, got no date.  Probably ain't worth a duck's fart (proffers his own watch). This one here cost me $3.75 and it's got every doodad you can imagine. No sir I'll stick with this (walks away). 
BOBBY You son of a bitch! I'll have my lawyers shut you down. 
DARRELL You ain't got no credit card but you got a lawyer. Sweet talk me all you want.  Didn't you read the sign? It says... 
BOBBY What sign? Fuck the sign. I want my car. 
DARRELL I want my hundred and forty-five dollars. 
Bobby stands his ground for a moment as if deciding whether or not to fight for the car, then wheels and walks away. 
Darrell looks at him, smirks. 
INT. TRUCK STOP/DINER - LATER 
It is a little worn diner-type stop one would find on most any open road:  Counter with stools, laminated menus, a Wurlitzer in the corner belching out country TUNES.  Business is slow but it's the only restaurant in town. There is a SHORT ORDER COOK in the kitchen, and FLO, a hard-looking waitress is behind the counter.  A couple of regular drivers, ED and BOYD, are seated on the stools, Boyd is flipping a coin. 
ED One-hundred-thirteen degrees.  That was back in July of forty-seven. That afternoon it dropped down to forty three! True story. 
BOYD One time last year I remember it went from 98 to 23 same day. Wind, black clouds come out like... 
BOBBY comes out of the men's room and sits at the end of the counter.  He has cleaned himself up a bit but still looks like a mess. He buries his face in the menu. 
BOBBY You got a beer? 
FLO What kind? 
BOBBY Beck's. 
FLO No Beck's. A-1, Coors... 
BOBBY Heineken? 
FLO No, we ain't got no Heineken.  We got Miller. 
BOBBY Genuine Draft? 
FLO No.  Just plain ol' Miller. Now you can fuckin' take it or you can fuckin' leave it. 
BOBBY I'll fuckin' take it. To go. 
SHORT ORDER COOK Flo, cheeseburger bleedin'. 
FLO I'll be right back with that beer. 
Flo moves off. 
BOBBY ...and a waitress named Flo.  Christ. 
As Bobby stares at the money on the counter in front of him, he hears, from somewhere outside the diner, the sound of a POLICE RADIO crackling. He now feels something against his foot.  He looks down and sees a CAT rubbing against his leg.  He gives it a good kick sending it sliding across the floor with a screech. 
BOBBY Fucking cat. 
In the background, two teenagers sit at a booth.  TOBY looks the part of a local, wearing jeans and a white T-shirt.  His hair is cropped close and he looks to be a senior in high school.  His girl, JENNY, is nondescript, neither ugly nor beautiful. She is the kind of girl most guys would pass without a second look. Toby gets up from his booth and goes to the bathroom.  After he is gone Jenny walks to Bobby. 
JENNY Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter for the juke? 
BOBBY What? 
JENNY I wanna play a song on the juke.  You got a quarter? 
Bobby looks at Jenny, then picks a quarter from his winnings and flips it to her. He can't resist putting a little charm into it. 
JENNY What happened to your hand? 
BOBBY I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more careful. 
JENNY Got any requests? 
BOBBY That country shit all sounds the same to me. 
JENNY How about I pick one out for you? 
Bobby half smiles.  Jenny plays a song.  Patsy Cline's "Your Cheatin' Heart."  Jenny takes up a stool next to Bobby's. 
JENNY You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her. How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records. 
BOBBY Cause she's dead.

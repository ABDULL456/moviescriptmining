The salesman is see coming down the corridor to his apartment, still carrying the aluminum case. He quickly enters his apartment door in a business-like manner. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP 
Jeff starts to assume a thoughtful air, when he is startled by a light which falls across his face from the right. He looks toward the light. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT 
The light comes from the song-writer's apartment. His door is open, and he is hanging onto the door frame, his hand still on the light switch. He surveys his apartment. He appears rather drunk. He comes into the apartment, closes the door behind him, and sways a little. He wears a hat, pushed back on his forehead, and no raincoat. His clothes are quite wet. He might have even fallen. 
He looks disgustedly at the piano, then lurches toward it. There is no doubt now as the state of his drunkenness. At the piano he viciously sweeps all the note paper off the music stand. This seems to give him some satisfaction, but he loses his balance, twists sideways, and fall into a nearby chair. He remains there, bleary-eyed and a little sick. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP 
What he has observed seems to give Jeff an idea. He moves his wheelchair backward and to the left alongside the side board. Awkwardly, with his left hand, he reaches up for a bottle of whiskey. He cradles the bottle in his lap, and reaches for a tumbler. He then wheels back to the window, and pours himself a good, long drink. He lifts up the glass, starts to drink, but something happening beyond his window startles him and he stops in the middle of his drink, his eyes a little wider then usual.

The salesman is again leaving his apartment with his aluminum suitcase.

Jeff's eyes travel down to the street. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT 
A brief moment or two. Then the salesman, carrying his aluminum case, crosses the street. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP 
Jeff's face is expressionless. He just stares.

Jeff's head is nodding and dozing again. The side light from the song-writer's apartment is no longer on his face. Jeff's eyes open, then his head comes up quickly, trying to clear the sleep from his mind, as he remembers the object of his vigilance. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT 
The salesman's apartment shows the shades drawn and a dim light burning behind them. The CAMERA PANS to the empty corridor. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP 
Jeff's eyes turn sharply in the direction of the street. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT 
The street is deserted. At the right hand side of the screen a light goes on. THE CAMERA PANS OVER and we see that Miss Torso has returned from her date. She is wearing a three- quarter length coat over her evening dress. She is inside, with the door two-thirds closed, but she leans out to kiss someone goodnight. Then it takes some coaxing to get the door completely closed. 
She turns the key in the lock. She listens a moment then comes to the center of the room. She takes her coat off and drapes it over chair. She removes the screen in front of the ice box, then opens the ice box. 
She searches it for something to eat; finds a big piece of pumpkin pie. She closes the ice box. She starts to eat the pie as she moves in the direction of the bathroom. Stopping a moment, she puts the piece of pie on a table, and proceeds to take off her dress. Undoing the zippers, she slides it over her head as she passes into the bathroom. The dress is thrown on a nearby chair, and the bare arm picks up a piece of pie. She is now in the bathroom. We see her slip down the brassiere straps, but the window does not permit us to see any lower. As she munches on the pie, she pulls out a few pins holding up her hair, which she proceeds to brush rhythmically. She turns and moves down her bare back.

Jeff's eyes suddenly switch to the street. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI LONG SHOT 
We catch a quick glimpse of the salesman, just passing the alleyway, suitcase in hand. The CAMERA PANS across the ballet dancer's apartment, over to the salesman's apartment. It waits, until he appears in the corridor. 
He enters his apartment. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP 
Jeff sits in his wheelchair, looking quietly out at the neighborhood, sleep beginning to take hold on him again. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - LONG SHOT 
THE CAMERA PANS slightly over the whole of the neighborhood. The lights in Miss Torso's apartment snap out. Only one light remains. It burns behind the drawn shades of the salesman's apartment.

INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAWN - CLOSEUP 
A big head of Jeff. He is still in his wheelchair, sound asleep. The CAMERA PANS off his face, out through the window. The rain has stopped, and the general light of dawn is coming up. The CAMERA COMES TO REST on the salesman's apartment and corridor, which is still dimly lit by the electric lights. 
We see the salesman emerge into the corridor, pause a moment to allow a woman to proceed him. Her back is to the CAMERA and we do not see her face. They move away, down the corridor. The CAMERA PANS BACK into Jeff's sleeping face.

It is now mid-morning. The sun is shining. Miss Torso is practicing her dance to the sound of ballet music. 
We can hear the song-writer at work, but the thing that attracts our attention mostly, is some action that emanates from the fire escape where the couple sleep at night. On a long rope, the woman is lowering an open wicker basket in which sits a small dog. When is reaches the yard below, the CAMERA PANNING DOWN, the dog steps out and runs off to explore the yard. The woman pulls up the basket, and leaves it on the fire escape. The CAMERA PULL BACK into Jeff's apartment where Stella is busy massaging Jeff's back at he lies face down on the divan. 
STELLA You'd think the rain would have cooled things off. All it did was make the heat wet. 
Stella hits a sore muscle in Jeff's back. He jumps. 
JEFF That's a stiff one. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - MEDIUM SHOT 
A low camera has Jeff's head on the foreground, with Stella just behind him, at work on his back. She attacks the sore muscle vigorously. 
STELLA The insurance Company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed, not the wheelchair. 
JEFF (Between clenched teeth) How did you know! 
STELLA Eyes bloodshot. Must have been staring out the window for hours.

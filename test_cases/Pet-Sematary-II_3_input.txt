Chase's headlights stream through the windows, distorting the interior. The house looks like it's been through a tornado. A trail of BLOODY PAW PRINTS leads into the kitchen. The stench is repulsive. Grimacing, Chase has to keep himself from gagging. 
CHASE Jesus... 
As Chase moves forward, he catches sight of... 
GUS 
standing in a swath of light. At Gus' feet is Zowie, tongue lolling out of his mouth. Dead for the second time. Scattered around the dog are various tools. 
Propped against the wall is the cut out square of wood. It's fitted with hinges at the top. 
CHASE Gus, what are you doing?! 
Gus glances down at the dead dog. 
GUS (dead-pan) I was building a doggy door. 
CHASE God damn it Gus, you dug up my wife! What the fuck is going on around here?! 
Gus brings a cordless electric drill up from his side, pointing it at Chase in a threatening manner. 
GUS (grins) A little drilling. A little killing. 
As Gus moves forward, Chase gets a good look at him for the first time. He doesn't look even remotely alive. 
CHASE Holy shit! 
Chase levels his gun with a trembling hand. 
Gus stabs the air with the drill, feeding on Chase's horror. 
Chase pulls the trigger. A bullet pounds Gus' chest. A SPRAY OF FLESH explodes from his back. 
Unphased, Gus regains his balance. 
GUS God I hate when that happens... 
Before Chase can squeeze off the next round, Gus rips the gun from his grip... 
GUS You got a permit for that? 
Opening the chamber, Gus empties the remaining bullets and tosses the gun aside. 
GUS Didn't think so. 
Gus fires up the drill. The bit spinZZZZZZ. He DIVES at Chase, knocking him back against the counter. The drill bit SINKS INTO CHASE'S ARM... 
Chase SCREAMS as Gus withdraws it. Now, he presses it into Chase's shoulder. Chase is on the verge of blacking out now. The pain is unbearable... 
Gus withdraws the drill once again, aiming now for Chase's eye. 
GUS (maniacal) No brain, no pain, Chase. Think about it... 
The whirling drill bit is millimeters away from Chase's eye. He clutches Gus' arm, trying to force the drill aside... 
At the last second, adrenaline kicks in and Chase diverts the drill. It SINKS INTO the counter-top nearby... STUCK. 
Gus ROARS, lashing out, but Chase manages to duck away... 
Chase catches sight of HIS GUN on the floor. He scrambles for it, scooping it up... 
BULLETS are rolling across the floor every which way. Chase slaps his palm down on one and desperately fumbles with the chamber... 
Gus' hands CLAMP DOWN around Chase's neck. He swings Chase around and SLAMS him against the wall, lifting him off his feet... 
Chase GASPS as the life is literally crushed out of him... 
He brings the gun up beneath Gus' chin and jams it into his ruined throat. Gus just keeps on throttling him... 
GUS (insane) Just remember, Chase... I had Renee first... and now I'm gonna have her last... 
BLAM! The top of Gus' head BLOWS off. His BODY is thrown back by the incredible force, tumbling him to the kitchen floor with a HEAVY THUD. 
Chase sucks in precious air, then his head snaps up. 
CHASE Geoff! 
EXT.  GUS' HOUSE - NIGHT 
Chase stumbles from the house. It's a wonder he's even conscious. He swings open the van door and throws himself inside, sinking the key into the ignition. 
INT.  ATTIC - NIGHT 
Marjorie is now seated before Renee's theatrical make-up mirror, entranced. She's wearing the beaded peach dress. 
With the help of Renee's vast array of cosmetics, Marjorie has turned herself into a stunning beauty. 
The lipstick isn't quite right. Turning to the countertop magnifying mirror, she carefully touches up her ruby red lips. Her face fills nearly the entire mirror...

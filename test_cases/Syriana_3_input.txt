STAN Questions two and three seem obvious to me. Missiles are everywhere. Christ, Casey gave 'em out like party favors. This damage assessment, well, let's just say Nasir wasn't a home run. They're worried. About fall-out.

STAN (CONT'D) They're worried you may want to talk about it. But if you're already under investigation? 
BOB What about Mussawi? 
STAN Mussawi's a soldier. He's just like you. Bob stares at Stan who continues. 
STAN (CONT'D) Maybe he found God. Maybe he was having a bad day. Maybe Americans shouldn't travel these days. 
BOB Did Prince Nasir hide Mohammed Sheik Agiza in the Water Ministry? Does he fund terrorist organizations? 
STAN Tell people what they want to hear and they have a better chance of believing you. People were paid to lie, coached on their polygraphs. Single sources spread through different intelligence agencies that don't communicate with each other. You know how it's done. 
BOB Who's worried about the Nasir job? Stan, who's worried about me talking? On the screen: a LOUD, ACTION BEAT. Stan leans over and

139 EXT. ENERGY DEPARTMENT - DAY 139 
Hulking structures in concrete like Albert Speer's vision of heaven as Danny D. rants at Bennett -- 
(CONTINUED) 
139 CONTINUED: 139 
DANNY D. Some trust fund prosecutor, got off-message at Brown, thinks he's gonna run this up the flag pole, make a name for himself, maybe get elected some two-bit, no-name congressman from nowhere, with the result that Russia or China can suddenly start having, at our expense, all the advantages we enjoy here. No, I tell you. No. 
(MINCING) But, Danny, these are sovereign nations... Sovereign nations! What is a sovereign nation, but a collective of greed run by one individual. But, Danny, they're codified by the U.N. charter. Legitimized gangsterism on a global basis that has no more validity than an agreement between the Crips and the Bloods! Passing people shoot sidelong glances. A GROUP of men in suits are clearly waiting for Danny D. 
DANNY D. (CONT'D) Corruption charges. Corruption? Corruption ain't nothing more than government intrusion into market efficiencies in the form of regulation. That's Milton Friedman. He got a goddamn Nobel prize. We have laws against it precisely so we can get away with it. Corruption is our protection. Corruption is what keeps us safe and warm. Corruption is why you and I are here in the white-hot center of things instead of fighting each other for scraps of meat out there in the streets. 
(BEAT) Corruption... is how we win. Danny D. winds down. Finally -- 
BENNETT You broke the law, Mr. Dalton. 
DANNY D. Oh, who gives a shit! 
(CONTINUED) 
139 CONTINUED: (2) 139 
BENNETT You have 37 million dollars hidden away and the only question I can see of any relevance is whether you'll get to keep any of it. The two men are tiny against the architecture, the nation's capitol going on with it's day around them. 
140 EXT. CAPITOL HILL -- WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY 140 
Sydney approaches Bennett who eats his lunch outside the law offices of whiting and Sloan. 
SYDNEY How'd it go? Think you'll get invited on any more hunting trips? 
BENNETT He has kids. He's got a wife. 
SYDNEY He broke the law. Sydney holds out a golden envelope to Bennett. 
SYDNEY (CONT'D) Mr. Janus himself wanted me to extend an invitation to oilman of the Year. He's being honored so it should be a nice weekend. Relax. Get a massage. Congratulations. Perhaps the slightest flicker of distaste crosses Bennett's face. On the reverse the Capitol Building is so close you could reach out and touch it.

141 INT. EMIR'S SUITE - GENEVA - DAY 141 
A vast hotel suite, SILENT until the Emir's electric wheelchair rolls into sight. He rolls across marble, through rooms, until he approaches Prince Nasir and Prince Meshal. A long beat before the Emir speaks in Arabic. 
EMIR I am tired. 
PRINCE NASIR 
FATHER --

The demons make excited noises. 
KENNY Mph rmph rm! 
SATAN Get everyone in hell ready. When the blood of Terrance and Phillip spills, the day is ours! 
Two of the demons head for Satan's room. 
SATAN No! Not Saddam. Don't wake him... Uh... I'll tell him... 
Satan walks to the bedroom. 
EXT. INTERNMENT CAMP - ELECTRICAL BOX AREA 
Cartman approaches the electrical box nervously -- looking all around for soldiers. 
He opens the door to the electrical box and sees a large switch labeled ON and OFF.  He reaches to turn off the switch when he feels a tap on his shoulder. 
Cartman jumps. 
CARTMAN Agh!!! 
Then turns and karate-chops in one spastic flurry to see - KENNY!! 
CARTMAN Son of a gun!  HECK! 
Kenny's ghost is again floating in front of Cartman. Kenny again struggles to speak. 
CARTMAN GO AWAY, KENNY!  IT'S NOT MY GOSH DARN FAULT! 
KENNY Mph rmprmmh rm!! 
CARTMAN I don't have proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores, Kenny! 
KENNY MPH RMPH RMPH RMPH RM!!! 
CARTMAN AGAGAH!! 
Cartman runs off, leaving the power completely on. 
INT. KYLE'S HOUSE - ATTIC - NIGHT 
Ike is still just sitting quietly in the dark attic. 
Suddenly, the attic door bursts open! 
AMERICAN SOLDIER Found one! 
Other soldiers file into the attic and grab Ike by the arms. 
AMERICAN SOLDIER Yep, that's a Canadian alright. 
IKE Sibi mammama. 
The American Soldier picks up Ike. 
AMERICAN SOLDIER So, thought you could hide from us, did you?! Take him away! 
The soldiers drag Ike down the stairs. 
AMERICAN SOLDIER 2 Sir, look at this! (Holding up a book) He was writing some kind of diary... 
AMERICAN SOLDIER Diary?  What does it say? 
AMERICAN SOLDIER 2 (Reading) Cookie monster.  Banana. 
Sweeping, moving MUSIC STING. 
EXT.  INTERNMENT CAMP - STAN AND KYLE'S AREA 
Kyle is patiently awaiting Mole's return. 
KYLE Damn it! Come on, Mole we're running out of time! 
Kyle spins around when he hears someone coming. 
But it's only Cartman. He's panting heavily. 
CARTMAN You guys! Seriously! You guys! 
KYLE What Cartman?! 
CARTMAN Kenny! I saw Kenny again! 
STAN Oh, brother. 
KYLE Did you shut the alarm off, Cartman? 
Cartman stops breathing heavily and thinks. 
KYLE Cartman?! 
CARTMAN Whoops. 
Just then, all the alarms in the place go off. 
KYLE Oh shit! 
From the distance, the boys hear gunshots. 
Suddenly, the Mole pops out of the hole. The boys see that The Mole has been shot up badly. 
THE MOLE Ze alarms! Zey went off! 
CARTMAN Yeah... That was my bad, sorry. 
As SHOUTS and RUNNING FOOTSTEPS draw closer, The Mole lays down and begins to die in Kyle's arms. 
THE MOLE Please... Do not let ze resistance die... 
Gentle MUSIC begins.

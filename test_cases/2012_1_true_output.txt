Gordon helps Noah up the small ladder leading to the connecting tunnel. 
Just as he goes to hand him Jackson's backpack, the HYDRAULIC MOTORS begin to GROWL! Lin looks up in panic. He screams. 
LIN They're opening the gate! It will crush us! 
The whole ceiling begins to lower towards them. From down below, Jackson sees his son about to be hit by it. (CONTINUED) 
JACKSON Noah! Watch out! 
Gordon makes a split second decision. With all his strength, he shoves the boy into the tunnel. 
INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY 
From the other side of the tunnel, Kate watches as the metal ceiling misses Noah by a hair, but catches Gordon, wiping him off the ladder. 
KATE No! 
INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY 
Jackson watches helplessly as Gordon falls past him. He survives his landing and desperately tries to grab on to the sloping surface, but he can't. He slips. 
Gordon is crushed between the gears, sharing his last look with Jackson before he dies. 
INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY 
Kate helps a trembling Noah out of the tunnel. 
NOAH Something happened, mom. 
Kate pulls him close and shuts her eyes tightly. She fights back the tears. 
INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY 
Jackson and Lin know they're running out of time, their remaining space is shrinking every second. 
JACKSON We have to stop it! 
Lin grabs the huge electrical power drill nearby and attempts to jam it between the hydraulic arm and the wall. 
As it digs deeper into the metal, the hydraulic starts to slow down. 
EXT. ACCESS PLATFORM/CHO MING - DAY 
Still on the ledge, Yuri and the boys watch as the huge boarding gate lowers towards them. They are trapped. 
Just then, the gates begin to slow, but surely they will be crushed. 
INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY 
Back in the chamber, Lin still struggles with the drill. Suddenly he slips. 
Jackson manages to catch his fall. But in the process Lin's foot gets caught between the gears, mangling it. 
He screams in pain as the hydraulic slowly grinds towards a halt. 
JACKSON You did it, man. You did it. 
In great pain, Lin grins back at him. 
EXT. LAUNCH SITE/CHO MING VALLEY - DAY 
The gates of the ships hit the access platform with a thundering noise. People begin to rush on board. 
INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY 
Alarm signals go off. The Captain turns to one of his officers. 
CAPTAIN MICHAELS What's wrong with the gate? 
OFFICER I don't know. Maybe there's something jamming it, sir. 
The countdown on the monitor reads 2 min. 40 sec. Laura and Adrian share a worried look. 
We hear a HOLLOW BELL ring! 
CUT TO: 
EXT. YAK LA MONASTERY/TIBET - DAY 
Lama Yak La rings the large bronze bell of his monastery. 
(CONTINUED) 
The booming sound echoes through the Cho Ming valley. As a gentle wind catches the Lama's clothes, he looks up-- 
A tidal wave of immeasurable proportion crests the mountains. 
The Lama continues to strike the bell as the monastery is wiped clean from the earth. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY 
The technicians desperately try to figure out what's wrong. An officer waves Adrian over. 
SURVEILLANCE OFFICER Sir, we have a breach in the zoological bay. 
ADRIAN Can you zoom in? 
The video camera moves in on Kate, Noah and Lilly. Adrian can't believe his eyes. He turns to Laura. 
ADRIAN (CONT'D) I know those kids. Remember the book I told you about? Their father wrote it. 
Captain Michaels shouts across the room. 
CAPTAIN MICHAELS We're loaded. We can close the gates sir. 
ANHEUSER Do it! 
Anheuser looks nervously at the countdown. It reads 1:34

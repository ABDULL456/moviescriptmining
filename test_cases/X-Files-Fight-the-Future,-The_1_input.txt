EXT. STREET OUTSIDE DOWNSCALE BAR - NIGHT 
The street is empty, the hour is late. Mulder moves to the curb. 
MULDER And what's that? 
KURTZWEIL S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb. 
MULDER (rhetorical disbelief) He just let it explode. 
KURTZWEIL What's the question nobody's asking? Why that building? Why not the Federal Building? 
MULDER The Federal Building was too well guarded. 
KURTZWEIL No. They put the bomb in the building across the street because it DID have federal offices. The Federal Emergency Management Agency had a provisional medical quarantine office there. Which is where the bodies were found. But that's the thing... 
Mulder's got his hand up for a taxi coming. It's pulling over as Mulder steps from the curb, stepping away from Kurtzweil. 
KURTZWEIL ...the thing you didn't know. That you'd never think to check. 
Mulder's got the taxi door open, turning to Kurtzweil. 
KURTZWEIL Those people were already dead. 
MULDER Before the bomb went off? 
KURTZWEIL That's what I'm saying. 
Mulder stares at Kurtzweil for a moment. 
MULDER Michaud was a twenty-two year veteran of the bureau -- 
KURTZWEIL Michaud was a patriot. The men he's loyal to know their way around Dallas. They blew that building to hide something. Maybe something even they couldn't predict. 
MULDER You're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...? 
KURTZWEIL And one little boy. 
Mulder gets in the cab, closes the door. Rolls down the window. 
MULDER I think you're full of shit. 
KURTZWEIL Do you? 
Kurtzweil raps the top of the roof and steps away from the car. As the taxi takes off. WE STAY WITH KURTZWEIL, watching Mulder's cab speed away. (NOTE: This should also be covered from inside the cab with Mulder, to play the scene out on him.) 
CUT TO: 
INT. AGENT SCULLY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Scully is in bed, lying awake. Staring at the ceiling. When she reacts to a POUNDING AT HER DOOR. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SCULLY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON THE FRONT DOOR. Scully peeks in the peephole. Then she removes the safety chain, opening the door. 
MULDER (strangely intense) I wake you? 
SCULLY No. 
MULDER Why not? It's three AM. 
Scully gets a whiff of his breath. As he moves past her into the apartment. Radiating a kind of manic intensity. 
SCULLY Are you drunk, Mulder? 
MULDER I was until about an hour ago. 
SCULLY Is that before or after you got the idea to come here? 
Mulder looks at her curiously. 
MULDER What are you implying, Scully? 
SCULLY (frowning) I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting. 
MULDER Is that what you'd like me to do? 
Scully hesitates. Long enough to indicate her own wavering heart. 
SCULLY Go home, Mulder. It's late. 
MULDER Get dressed, Scully. 
SCULLY Mulder -- what are you doing?

PAUL Our room is painted white. Rosa wanted it to be different from the other rooms in the hotel. 
Marcel takes some LIPS SALVE from his bathrobe pocket. 
PAUL (CONT'D) To make it look like... a more normal home. But... it had to be changed here, too. I think she started with the wall. 
Paul takes notice of the LIP SALVE operation. 
MARCEL A cold sore. I don't know. Shit. 
Paul regards him for a second. 
PAUL You're lucky huh? You were... You must have been very handsome 20 years ago. 
MARCEL Not as much as you. 
PAUL You've still got all your hair. 
MARCEL My hair... I have to have it trimmed often. And wash it. I wash it nearly every day. 
PAUL Don't you have massages? 
He massages his own temples. MARCEL Yes, I do. 
PAUL You're in good shape. 
He paws at Marcel's stomach. 
PAUL (CONT'D) What do you do for... your stomach? That's my problem. 
MARCEL For that... 
He gazes across the room. 
MARCEL (CONT'D) I have a secret. 
He gets up and heads across the room. 
PAUL Tell me! 
He takes a bar from the floor and slides it into a spot on the top of a DOOR FRAME. 
PAUL (CONT'D) Ah... 
MARCEL Are you leaving us? I saw your suitcase was packed. Ah... America. Why was she unfaithful to you? 
PAUL You can't believe that Rosa... killed herself. It's hard for me to... believe, too. 
While Paul has a moment of REFLECTION, Marcel shows him his PULL-UP LEG KICK combo on his PULL-UP bar. 
MARCEL This is my secret! Thirty times every morning. 
Paul leaves, DISGUSTED. 
PAUL (ENGLISH) Really, Marcello, I wonder what she ever saw in you. CUT TO: 
INT. APT. BUILDING - DAY 
Jeanne comes in carrying her FUR COLLARED COAT, purse and a BAG. 
JEANNE Are you in? 
She looks around the place. 
JEANNE (CONT'D) Is anyone here? 
She kicks the door shut with her foot. She wanders to the... 
DINING ROOM 
JEANNE (CONT'D) Hi, monster. 
She throws her coat and purse on the table. She puts a PORTABLE RECORD PLAYER in the BASSINET. 
JEANNE (CONT'D) Is something wrong? 
From the other room we hear Paul... 
PAUL'S VOICE There's butter in the kitchen.

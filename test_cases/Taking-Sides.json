David present. \nEMMI Herr Rudolf Werner. \nWERNER enters, bows to Steve and David. Emmi goes to her desk. \nSTEVE Sit down, Werner. \nIndicates the upright chair; Werner sits. \nSTEVE I want you to understand why you're here. This is an investigation into Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler, former Prussian Privy Councillor, banned from public life under Control Council Directive No 24 and who's applied to come before the Tribunal of Artists of the Denazification Commission. I'm interested in what he was up to from 1933 to the end of the war, understood? \nWerner nods. \nSTEVE Rudolf Otto Werner. Wind section since 1936. What instrument did you play? \nWERNER First oboe. \nSTEVE I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party. \nWERNER Absolutely not. \nLong silence; Steve watches him. Werner is made more anxious. At last, in a rush: \nWERNER No, I was never a Nazi, I have no interest in politics, I'm a musician - \nSTEVE Hey, hey, slow up, Fraulein Straube has to take down what you say. \nWerner swivels round to look at Emmi. \nWERNER Straube? Any relation to Colonel Joachim Straube? \nEMMI My father. \nWERNER It's a great honour to meet you, Fraulein. Your father was a great patriot. \nBrief silence. \nWERNER Dr. Furtw\u00e4ngler is a great musician. He actively opposed the Nazis and later on he helped many Jews to escape. \n", "test1_true": "WERNER It was Hermann Goering. I was told he just made the maestro his Privy Councillor, no questions asked. Although Dr. Furtw\u00e4ngler stood up to him. And to Dr. Goebbels. \nSTEVE He also conducted for Hitler, didn't he? \nWERNER Yes, that's true, but he refused to give the Nazi salute. He kept his baton in his right hand. In Hitler's presence. That was a brave act... \nSTEVE Brave?  To celebrate Hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by Wagner but without the Nazi salute? Bravo. \nWERNER It was Beethoven's Ninth. \nSTEVE Do you really think it was brave? Didn't he bow to him and shake his hand? \nINT. STEVE'S OFFICE - DAY \nAnother man, SCHLEE, is in the chair. Only Steve and Emmi now. Pale, yellow electric light. Silence. Schlee, too, is very nervous. At last: \nSCHLEE No, no, no, I give you my word. I was never a member of the Nazi Party. Never. I am in the percussion section. I play the timpani. \nSteve just stares at him. \nSCHLEE Anyway, they would never have allowed it. My brother was married to a Jewess, may she rest in peace. And Goebbels said... (to Emmi) ...please take this down carefully, because it's most important, Fraulein? \nEMMI Straube. \nSCHLEE (acting surprised) Straube? Are you by any chance related to Colonel Joachim Straube? \nEMMI My father. \nSCHLEE He was... he was a great hero. \nSteve lights a cigarette. \nSCHLEE Goebbels, yes, Josef Goebbels said, 'There's not a single filthy Jew left in Germany on whose behalf Dr. Furtw\u00e4ngler has not intervened.' No, no one could have been less of a Nazi than Dr. Furtw\u00e4ngler. \nSTEVE But this was the same guy who conducted for Adolf on his birthday. \nSCHLEE He was forced to do that. But he refused to give the Nazi salute in front of Hitler. He kept his baton in his hand, you can't salute with a baton in your hand. \nDAVID And what about the Nuremberg Rally? \nSCHLEE No, we...we played on the evening before the Rally. \nSTEVE (straight-faced) Oh! The evening before, I see... \n", "test1_id": 1065, "test2_input": "RODE The problem was how could he avoid giving the Devil's salute when Satan was actually sitting there. (modestly taps his chest with his thumb.) And, I said, 'Dr. Furtw\u00e4ngler, why not enter with the baton in your right hand? Hitler will be sitting in the front row. If you give the salute with the baton in your right hand it'll look like you're going to poke his eyes out.' \nChuckles. David mouths I win to Steve. \nRODE He was...He was really grateful to me for that. After the concert, I... I stole that baton as a memento of a great act of courage. I still have it. I should have brought it to show you. I hope I'm not going too fast for you, Fraulein?- \nEMMI Straube. \nSteve and David exchange a brief look. \nRODE Straube. Any relation to Colonel Joachim Straube? \nEMMI My father. \nRODE (standing) I am deeply honoured to be in your presence, Fraulein Straube. Your father was a true patriot, a man of God. \nHe crosses himself. Silence. David raises a discreet finger. \nSTEVE You have a question for Helmuth, David? \nDAVID Yes. What was the orchestra's reaction when they asked you to play for Hitler's birthday? \nRODE Oh, we didn't play for his birthday, we played the evening before - it was the 19th of April not the 20th. \nSTEVE Do you know Hans Hinkel? \nRODE (alarmed) Do I know Hans Hinkel? \nSTEVE That's what I asked. \nRODE Do I know Hans Hinkel? \nSTEVE You seem to understand the question, now how about answering it? \nRODE Hans Hinkel was in the Ministry of Culture; how could I know such a man?  I \nBrief silence; a smile. \nRODE I hear the British have his... his archive, files, records. \nSTEVE Do you know what's in this archive? \nRODE How could I know what's in the archive? \nSteve nods, smiles. \n", "test2_true": "Rode stands and bows. \nINT. STEVE'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nThe final bars of the Fifth Symphony. Snowing. Dim light. There is more furniture now: two chairs, one comfortable, the other upright.  A sitting area by the window with the telephone extension. The 16-mm projector set up in another corner. \nSteve, at his desk, wrapped up against the cold, going through files, making notes. He stops, seems to listen, then goes to the window, looks out. \nThe music ends. The record hisses. Steve just stares out at the night and the snow. The record continues to hiss. \nINT./EXT TRAM, BERLIN (TRAVELLING) - DAY \nThe tram packed to overflowing. Then, a sudden stir among the passengers as people push through trying to find space. One of them is FURTW\u00c4NGLER. He's recognised. Whispering. He stares ahead or keeps his eyes downcast. An elderly man tugs at his coat, half-rises, offering his seat. Furtw\u00e4ngler manages a smile and shakes his head. The tram rattles on. \nINT. HALL, STEVE'S BUILDING - DAY \nFurtw\u00e4ngler approaches Adams at his desk. \nHe crosses to the stairs. German workmen stop what they are doing to let him pass. One of them bows. \nOn the upper landing, Emmi is making her way to Steve's office. \nShe stops, sees Furtw\u00e4ngler on the stairs and then dashes to Steve's door. \nFURTW\u00c4NGLER Furtw\u00e4ngler. \nINT. STEVE'S OFFICE - DAY \nEmmi bursts in on Steve and David. She's overawed: \nEMMI Major, Major... he's here ... \nSTEVE Shut the door, Emmi. Sit down, Emmi. We're going to keep him waiting, too. \nEmmi glances out again and reluctantly closes the door, Steve sits calmly, relaxed. \nSTEVE Emmi, get us some coffee, will you? And, Emmi, don't offer him coffee. Don't even greet him, okay? \nINT. WAITING ROOM - DAY \nFurtw\u00e4ngler sits, waiting. Emmi, deeply embarrassed, hurries through.. Furtw\u00e4ngler is about to ask her something, but she's gone. He waits. \nINT. STEVE'S OFFICE - DAY \n", "test2_id": 1066, "test3_input": "STEVE AND HIS POV: David slides a note across to Emmi. Emmi reads the note. David watches her. She looks at him. She almost smiles, nods surreptitiously. \nDAVID (a whisper) Schubert. \nShe feels Steve's eyes on her, and returns quickly to her work. \nSteve is displeased and even more suspicious. \nEXT. PARTLY RUINED CHURCH - EVENING \nSummer evening. The first movement of Schubert's String Quintet in C Major, D956, played by three men and two women to a large audience packed into the ruins, partly open to the sky, Dymshitz  among them. \nAt the rear of the church, Emmi and David, enraptured, seated side by side. \nThe first movement ends and the Adagio begins. After the music gathers momentum: \nRain. Thunder and lightning. The musicians continue to play, unperturbed.  They are coming to the end of the Quintet. \nDavid and Emmi huddled together. Some umbrellas up and then movement which catches David's attention. He nudges Emmi, I indicates with his chin. \nPeople have moved to reveal Furtw\u00e4ngler: seated, wearing a hat, still I' as a statue, soaked, listening, expressionless. \nMuch applause. The musicians bow. The audience start to leave. \nEmmi and David emerge from the ruins.  Furtw\u00e4ngler passes them. \nThey nod awkwardly. He doesn't respond but is about to walk on when Dymshitz pushes through, nods to David, who salutes. Dymshitz catches up with Furtw\u00e4ngler. They are near to Emmi and David. \nDYMSHITZ Dr. Furtw\u00e4ngler - \nFurtw\u00e4ngler stops. \nDYMSHITZ Moving, you agree? Whenever I hear Schubert I am moved.  You agree? \nFURTW\u00c4NGLER The tempi were a little too correct for my taste. But I expect that is because of the rain. \nHe nods politely, is about to go - \nDYMSHITZ (also for David's benefit) Wait, Doctor, I understand you have difficulties with the Americans. I want you to know, I am your champion. We can help. \nFurtw\u00e4ngler allows himself a faint smile, tips his hat, and then hurries off into the night. Dymshitz goes, too. David and Emmi watch them.  Then: \nEMMI (frowning, worried) What does he mean, too correct? \nDAVID I don't know. \n", "test3_true": "INT. STEVE'S BEDROOM, GRAND HOTEL - NIGHT \nSteve, fully dressed, lies on the bed in his small, shabby room, staring into space. He is suddenly startled by a loud roll of thunder and then a fierce crack of lightning. \nHe goes to the window, watching the rain. He stands motionless for a second, then makes a decision. He grabs his cap, a raincoat from the back of the door. Another loud thunderclap. \nINT. US OFFICERS' CLUB - NIGHT \nDancers jitterbugging and jiving. Among them, David and Emmi also dancing, imitating the others and having a good time. The music ends. Scattered applause. The band leaves the platform. The dancers return to tables or the bar. \nLater: \nDavid and Emmi at their table, eating. She eats voraciously, eyes glazed, all her concentration on the food in front of her. David is fascinated, can't stop watching her. \nSteve enters the club, makes his way to the bar, orders a drink. \nSteve turns to survey the room, almost at once spots David and Emmi, their backs to him. He observes them. \nDavid and Emmi at their table: They have finished their meal. Emmi is silent now, staring at her empty plate. \nSteve is suddenly at their table. \nSTEVE Well, what is this, the office party? \nDavid and Emmi are frozen with embarrassment. \nSTEVE May I join you? (sits down, beams.) So, what have you two been up to tonight? Hey. Don't I owe you a bottle of French champagne? \nTries to get a waiter's attention but fails. \u0095 No response. \nSTEVE You know, David, you're a lucky guy. I invited Emmi here but she turned me down. You must've hidden depths, David... \nhe band starts to play; he stands, holds out a hand. \nSTEVE C'mon, Emmi, let's dance. I'll teach you how to jive. \nShe is horribly embarrassed, doesn't move. David suddenly stands and takes Emmi by the arm. \nDAVID I'm very sorry, Major, but I promised her mother, we have to go. \nThey leave quickly. \nSteve watches them. He sinks down, angry and jealous. \n", "test3_id": 1067}

{"train": "TAKING SIDES \nby Ronald Harwood \nadapted from the play by Ronald Harwood \nFinal Draft, 1988 \nFADE IN: \nINT. BERLIN CONCERT HALL (1944) - NIGHT \nA man conducting Beethoven.  Air raid in progress.  Bombs falling nearby.  The orchestra continues to play.  Suddenly the lights go out.  The music stops. \nINT. BACKSTAGE CORRIDOR, CONCERT HALL - NIGHT \nA beam from a torch, bouncing, making shadows.  An ATTENDANT, carrying the torch, hurries down the corridor. The air raid continues. \nHe comes to a door, knocks, opens it and looks in. \nATTENDANT (agitated) Dr. Furtw\u00e4ngler, the Reichsminister. \nThe sound of heavy footsteps approaching.  The attendant turns his torch to light the way for three men in Nazi uniform, also with attendants and torches, marching down the corridor. \nThe attendant bows deeply as the REICHSMINISTER and his aide go through the door. The other man remains in the corridor on guard. \nINT. CONDUCTOR'S ROOM - NIGHT \nCandles light the room where the conductor shakes hands with the Reichsminister. \nREICHSMINISTER Dr. Furtw\u00e4ngler, I want to apologise personally for this power failure. I was so enjoying the performance. In times like these we need spiritual nourishment. \nA bomb explodes nearby. \nREICHSMINISTER But I welcome this unexpected opportunity of talking to you. (with great care) When you came on to the platform tonight, I thought you weren't well.  You looked tired, (a warning) Get away from this bombing. Away from the war.  Yes, you look tired... (a crooked smile) Even in this light. \nINT. RUINED CINEMA - DAY \nDark.  ON A SCREEN: scenes from Leni Riefenstahl's triumph of the will. Over this: \nA MAN'S VOICE Look at them. Men, women, kids. Boy, did they love him. You see, Steve, Adolf Hitler touched something deep, real deep and savage and barbaric, and it won't just go away overnight. It's got to be rooted out. You know what I think? I think they were all Nazis. And let's face it, their leaders, those bastards now on trial in Nuremberg, couldn't have done it alone. It's these people, they gave all the help that was needed. Willingly. \nThe film changes with a scratchy music soundtrack - Wagner. SHOTS of high-ranking Nazis in an audience including Josef Goebbels, listening. And they're listening to and watching Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler conducting. At the appropriate moment: THE MAN'S VOICE That's him.  Furtw\u00e4ngler. Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler. \nThe Nazis applaud. Goebbels shakes hands with Furtw\u00e4ngler. The film ends. \nSteve watches expressionless. \nWALLACE Next reel, please. \nON THE SCREEN: SHOTS of camp survivors. Then SHOTS of emaciated corpses being bulldozed into mass graves. \nARCHIVE FILM Sanitary conditions were so appalling that heavy equipment had to be brought in to speed the work of cleaning up. This was Bergen Belsen. \nThe moment this appears, Steve rises and goes quickly. \nON THE SCREEN: piles of cadavers. \nINT. MAJOR STEVE ARNOLD'S BEDROOM (I945) - NIGHT \nSteve having a nightmare, twisting, turning, moaning. He wakes with a cry. He is sweating. He turns on the light, looks at a clock, reaches for a cigarette, lights it. He smokes. He stares at the ceiling. \nLater: \nEarly morning. Cold. Steve is at the basin in his small room, shaving. A radio on a shelf. \nAMERICAN RADIO VOICE Remember, men, no fraternisation. In a German town, if you bow to a pretty girl or pat a blond child, you bow to all that Hitler stood for. You bow to his reign of blood. You caress the ideology that meant death and destruction. You never know who was a member of the Nazi Party. Don't be fooled. Don't fraternise. \nEXT. STEVE'S OFFICE BUILDING, BERLIN - DAY \nSteve's car swerves round the corner and comes to a halt. A small crowd watch workmen on ladders hammering away at a stone swastika above the portico. American soldiers supervise. Steve gets out of the car, carrying an attache case, and he, too, watches as the stone swastika falls and crashes into pieces on the road. One or two people clap, most just stare. \nThe American soldiers immediately hoist the Stars and Stripes. Steve goes into the building. The sentry salutes. \nThe driver of the car goes to the trunk and takes out a labelled duffel bag, cans of film, a case which holds a 16- mm projector. A small BOY sidles up to him: \nBOY Cigarettes, chewing gum? \nINT. WAITING ROOM - DAY \nSteve and Sergeant Adams ascending a grand, winding but damaged staircase to the rear of a spacious entrance hall. A once impressive building. Signs of bomb damage everywhere. German workmen doing repairs. American military personnel coming and going, saluting Steve, who barely acknowledges them. \nThey reach the landing. Adams opens double doors and they go through. \nADAMS We're gonna have the heating fixed by tonight. \nA few gilt chairs, a workman trying to repair the stove. Adams opens another door for Steve. \nINT. STEVE S OFFICE - DAY \nEMMI is hanging the standard photograph of President Truman on the wall. She turns to see Steve and Adams and is covered with confusion. She gives Steve a little curtsey. \nThe two men look up, startled. Emmi beams: \nEMMI It works!  Hallelujah! \nINT. STEVE'S OFFICE - DAY \nEmmi at the door. Steve at his desk. David present. \nEMMI Herr Rudolf Werner. \nWERNER enters, bows to Steve and David. Emmi goes to her desk. \nSTEVE Sit down, Werner. \nIndicates the upright chair; Werner sits. \nSTEVE I want you to understand why you're here. This is an investigation into Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler, former Prussian Privy Councillor, banned from public life under Control Council Directive No 24 and who's applied to come before the Tribunal of Artists of the Denazification Commission. I'm interested in what he was up to from 1933 to the end of the war, understood? \nWerner nods. \nSTEVE Rudolf Otto Werner. Wind section since 1936. What instrument did you play? \nWERNER First oboe. \nSTEVE I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party. \nWERNER Absolutely not. \nLong silence; Steve watches him. Werner is made more anxious. At last, in a rush: \nWERNER No, I was never a Nazi, I have no interest in politics, I'm a musician - \nSTEVE Hey, hey, slow up, Fraulein Straube has to take down what you say. \nWerner swivels round to look at Emmi. \nWERNER Straube? Any relation to Colonel Joachim Straube? \nEMMI My father. \nWERNER It's a great honour to meet you, Fraulein. Your father was a great patriot. \nBrief silence. \nWERNER Dr. Furtw\u00e4ngler is a great musician. He actively opposed the Nazis and later on he helped many Jews to escape. \nSCHLEE Yes, Dr. Furtw\u00e4ngler was absolutely clear about this: politics and art must be kept separate. \nSTEVE Politics and art must be kept separate. I'll remember that. But let me see if you can help me with something I just don't understand. I'd really like to know why all you guys are so crazy about him. What's his secret? \nSchlee tries to find words. \nSCHLEE Well, it's hard to explain. I can only tell you from my own experience. Soon after I joined the orchestra, we were rehearsing the Third Symphony of Beethoven, the Eroica. There are several rather difficult passages for the timpani. One particular crescendo. During the break, I asked how he wanted it played. He was studying his score. He didn't look up. He said, 'Just watch me.'  So, of course, I did. I never stopped watching him. The moment came. And suddenly, he turned to me and our eyes were locked. There was something in his look that...  that simply demanded the crescendo. I shall never forget his look. It was a moment of... of magic. \nSteve nods, thinks for a moment. Then: \nSTEVE You ever seen Adolf Hitler's eyes when he was making a speech? I've seen 'em on films. \nSCHLEE Yes. \nSTEVE Was looking at Furtw\u00e4ngler like that? \nSCHLEE I don't know what you mean, Major. \nSTEVE When you got to the crescendo. \nSchlee looks at him bewildered. \nINT./EXT. CAR (TRAVELLING), LAKESIDE AND MANSION - DAY \nIn the back, David and Steve. Military driver. The car's making its way along a road that skirts a lake towards a grand mansion from which fly the four Allied flags. \nSTEVE You think a whole orchestra, what, a hundred and forty or so guys, could be orchestrated? \nDAVID I guess it's possible. \nSTEVE So, what does the Russki want? \nDAVID Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you. \nSTEVE 'Dim-shits'? \nINT. THE MANSION - DAY \nA huge, cavernous room, once the ballroom. \nIn the centre, a table with four chairs. To one side, antique furniture, objets d'art, paintings. Four Allied officers are surveying the treasures: COLONEL DYMSHITZ, COLONEL GREEN (American), MAJOR RICHARDS (British) and CAPTAIN VERNAY (French). What they say is barely audible, low mumbles. They're accompanied by aides with clipboards, taking notes. \nBeyond, and some distance away, a row of gilt chairs for observers where David and Steve take their seats. \nSTEVE What the hell are they doing? \nRODE The problem was how could he avoid giving the Devil's salute when Satan was actually sitting there. (modestly taps his chest with his thumb.) And, I said, 'Dr. Furtw\u00e4ngler, why not enter with the baton in your right hand? Hitler will be sitting in the front row. If you give the salute with the baton in your right hand it'll look like you're going to poke his eyes out.' \nChuckles. David mouths I win to Steve. \nRODE He was...He was really grateful to me for that. After the concert, I... I stole that baton as a memento of a great act of courage. I still have it. I should have brought it to show you. I hope I'm not going too fast for you, Fraulein?- \nEMMI Straube. \nSteve and David exchange a brief look. \nRODE Straube. Any relation to Colonel Joachim Straube? \nEMMI My father. \nRODE (standing) I am deeply honoured to be in your presence, Fraulein Straube. Your father was a true patriot, a man of God. \nHe crosses himself. Silence. David raises a discreet finger. \nSTEVE You have a question for Helmuth, David? \nDAVID Yes. What was the orchestra's reaction when they asked you to play for Hitler's birthday? \nRODE Oh, we didn't play for his birthday, we played the evening before - it was the 19th of April not the 20th. \nSTEVE Do you know Hans Hinkel? \nRODE (alarmed) Do I know Hans Hinkel? \nSTEVE That's what I asked. \nRODE Do I know Hans Hinkel? \nSTEVE You seem to understand the question, now how about answering it? \nRODE Hans Hinkel was in the Ministry of Culture; how could I know such a man?  I \nBrief silence; a smile. \nRODE I hear the British have his... his archive, files, records. \nSTEVE Do you know what's in this archive? \nRODE How could I know what's in the archive? \nSteve nods, smiles. \nSteve and David preparing papers. \nINT. WAITING ROOM - DAY \nFurtw\u00e4ngler waiting. Emmi enters from the landing door carrying a tray and three mugs of coffee. She hurries towards the office door, eyes downcast. \nFURTW\u00c4NGLER Fraulein? \nEmmi stops. \nFURTW\u00c4NGLER How long am I to be kept waiting? \nEmmi bites her lip and, without looking at him, disappears into the office.  Furtw\u00e4ngler closes his eyes, breathes deeply. \nHe stands, goes to the window, looks out. \nINT. STEVE'S OFFICE - DAY \nSilence. Steve studying his notes. David watching him. Emmi staring forlornly into space. \nSTEVE Okay, Emmi, go get him. \nEmmi rises, opens the door, nods, turns back to Steve. \nEMMI Dr. Furtw\u00e4ngler. \nFurtw\u00e4ngler enters. As he passes her, Emmi gives him a small curtsey. David nods. Steve doesn't look up. Furtw\u00e4ngler waits a moment, glances round, sees the more comfortable chair and sits in it. Steve looks up. \nSTEVE I didn't hear anyone invite you to sit down. \nFurtw\u00e4ngler stands. Steve points to the other chair. \nSTEVE Sit there. \nFurtw\u00e4ngler sits. \nSTEVE I want you to understand why you're here. You're automatically banned from public life under Control Council Directive No 24. We're here to look into your case before you appear in front of the Tribunal for Artists of the Denazification Commission. You understand that? \nFURTW\u00c4NGLER I have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria. \nSTEVE What they do in Austria doesn't interest me one little bit. Okay? I have your questionnaire here, (reading) Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler, born Berlin, January 1886. Orchestral conductor. And you say here you were never a member of the Nazi Party. \nFURTW\u00c4NGLER That is correct. \nA very long silence. When the silence is unbearable Steve speaks. \nSTEVE I keep hearing you helped a lot of Jews to escape. How did you do that? \nFURTW\u00c4NGLER I don't remember in detail, there were so many. \nSTEVE Did you call someone you knew? \nFURTW\u00c4NGLER I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember. \nSTEVE Let me me help you, then. You picked up the phone and made a call - (Mimes a telephone.) 'Hello, Adolf? Wilhelm speaking. Listen, old pal, there's a Jew-boy musician I want you to help. He needs a permit to get to Paris.' \nEmmi sticks her fingers in her ears and shuts her eyes tight. \nSTEVE Or maybe you called Goebbels or Goering? You were so close you were in the same shithouse as them. \nFURTW\u00c4NGLER May I ask a question? \nSTEVE Sure. \nFURTW\u00c4NGLER When will my case be heard by the Tribunal? \nSTEVE Your guess is as good as mine. \nFURTW\u00c4NGLER I need to work. I need to make my living. I live off the generosity of friends... \nSTEVE Tough, tough! \nFURTW\u00c4NGLER (now more and more agitated) Then why is it, please, that another conductor who was actually a member of the Party, who used to play the Horst Wessel before his concerts, has already been cleared and is working again while I have to wait and wait and wait? \nSTEVE I don't know, he wasn't my case. Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended? \nFURTW\u00c4NGLER It was because I learned that the Gestapo was about to arrest me. \nSTEVE Why were they going to arrest you? \nFURTW\u00c4NGLER I believe it was because of another letter I'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies. \nSTEVE You didn't complain about the racial policies, just about the musical standards, is that right? \nNo response. \nSTEVE So, how did you learn that the Gestapo was out to get you? \nFURTW\u00c4NGLER During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtw\u00e4ngler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant. \nSTEVE You sure knew a lot of people in high places. \nThe sound of Steve laughing with delight.  Furtw\u00e4ngler hesitates. \nEmmi comes to the waiting-room door, watches, as if on guard. \nDavid comes round to face Furtw\u00e4ngler. \nDAVID (he gathers courage) When I was a child, my father, he took me to... he took me to one of your concerts. I remember you conducted Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. I was deeply moved. And I've loved music ever since. I was grateful to you. And I've admired you. How could you... how could you serve those criminals? \nHe falls silent. \nINT. STEVE'S OFFICE - DAY \nEmmi, at the open door, has been listening. She's shocked, turns away to see Steve, on the extension, chuckling, grinning from ear to ear. \nSTEVE How many?  Jesus, that's dynamite! Okay. \nINT. WAITING ROOM - DAY \nDavid and Furtw\u00e4ngler haven't moved. Both are looking towards Steve's office and Emmi in the doorway. \nAgain the sound of Steve's laugh. Then Emmi steps into the room, approaches Furtw\u00e4ngler. \nEMMI Dr. Furtw\u00e4ngler. \nHe gives her a wonderful smile.  And, suddenly, Steve stands in the doorway, smiling. \nSTEVE Well now. Aren't we all sociable? \nThe others are made awkward. \nSTEVE I've got to hand it to the British, David. You know what those guys are?  Decent. (He sits, crosses his legs.) Tell me, Herr Dr. Furtw\u00e4ngler, do you know Hans Hinkel? \nFURTW\u00c4NGLER Yes, a despicable human being. He was in the Ministry of Culture. His job was to get rid of Jews in the arts. \nSTEVE Yup, that's him, that's the guy. You know what else the little creep did? He kept files, close on 250,000 files. And you know what's in those files? \nFURTW\u00c4NGLER Certainly not, but I knew he had informers everywhere. Even in my orchestra there was someone \nSTEVE Who? \nFURTW\u00c4NGLER I wasn't told. I just knew it. \nSTEVE How? \nFURTW\u00c4NGLER (uneasy) I was warned. \nSTEVE AND HIS POV: David slides a note across to Emmi. Emmi reads the note. David watches her. She looks at him. She almost smiles, nods surreptitiously. \nDAVID (a whisper) Schubert. \nShe feels Steve's eyes on her, and returns quickly to her work. \nSteve is displeased and even more suspicious. \nEXT. PARTLY RUINED CHURCH - EVENING \nSummer evening. The first movement of Schubert's String Quintet in C Major, D956, played by three men and two women to a large audience packed into the ruins, partly open to the sky, Dymshitz  among them. \nAt the rear of the church, Emmi and David, enraptured, seated side by side. \nThe first movement ends and the Adagio begins. After the music gathers momentum: \nRain. Thunder and lightning. The musicians continue to play, unperturbed.  They are coming to the end of the Quintet. \nDavid and Emmi huddled together. Some umbrellas up and then movement which catches David's attention. He nudges Emmi, I indicates with his chin. \nPeople have moved to reveal Furtw\u00e4ngler: seated, wearing a hat, still I' as a statue, soaked, listening, expressionless. \nMuch applause. The musicians bow. The audience start to leave. \nEmmi and David emerge from the ruins.  Furtw\u00e4ngler passes them. \nThey nod awkwardly. He doesn't respond but is about to walk on when Dymshitz pushes through, nods to David, who salutes. Dymshitz catches up with Furtw\u00e4ngler. They are near to Emmi and David. \nDYMSHITZ Dr. Furtw\u00e4ngler - \nFurtw\u00e4ngler stops. \nDYMSHITZ Moving, you agree? Whenever I hear Schubert I am moved.  You agree? \nFURTW\u00c4NGLER The tempi were a little too correct for my taste. But I expect that is because of the rain. \nHe nods politely, is about to go - \nDYMSHITZ (also for David's benefit) Wait, Doctor, I understand you have difficulties with the Americans. I want you to know, I am your champion. We can help. \nFurtw\u00e4ngler allows himself a faint smile, tips his hat, and then hurries off into the night. Dymshitz goes, too. David and Emmi watch them.  Then: \nEMMI (frowning, worried) What does he mean, too correct? \nDAVID I don't know. \nINT. HALL, STAIRWAY, STRAUBE APARTMENT BLOCK - NIGHT \nDavid and Emmi enter the hall, each locked in their own thoughts.  They reach the foot of the stairs and pause. They want to kiss but both are too awkward. She starts up the stairs. \nEMMI Don't see me to my door, there's no need. \nDAVID But I promised your mother. \nShe stops, turns. \nEMMI Well, sleep well. \nShe continues on her way. \nINT. ARCHIVE ROOM - DAY \nSteve and Emmi at work on the files. One or two BRITISH OFFICERS present, and David, who is working at the far end of the table. He has a cold. \nEmmi, who also has a cold, opens a file and is immediately alert. She reads. She blows her nose. She is uncertain. She looks up at Steve. She makes a decision. She rises, takes the file to Steve. \nEMMI Excuse me, Major. I found this on Helmuth Rode. You remember? The second violinist? Look, he's Austrian not German. But it's this that's more important, I think... \nShe points to something. Steve laughs loudly. \nAN OFFICER Sssh! \nDavid looks up at them, puzzled. Then a British SERGEANT comes into the doorway. \nSERGEANT Lieutenant Wills, telephone - \nDavid rises and as he goes: \nTHE OFFICER (exasperated) What is this, a railway station? \nINT. LOBBY, ARCHIVE BUILDING - DAY \nIn a booth near the front desk, David is on the telephone. \nDAVID (into telephone) David. Wills. Hello? Who? Who in Wiesbaden? \nIrritated, he taps the receiver but the line's gone dead. \nEXT. LAKESIDE, BERLIN - DAY \nSteve lies, shirt off, taking the sun. Children playing. Noise behind him of someone in the bushes. Steve doesn't move. \nSTEVE Of course. You, too. Like everyone else in this goddamn country. \nEXT. WOOD, LAKESIDE - DAY \nRode and Steve walking. Rode suddenly turns to him: \nRODE I've remembered something else... \nSTEVE Yeah? \nRODE Furtw\u00e4ngler sent Hitler a telegram for his birthday. \nSTEVE He did? \nRODE One of your people told me. \nSTEVE One of my people? \nThey start to walk away from the water. \nRODE Yes. A corporal. US Army. A Jew. He said he'd seen the telegram in the Chancellery. \nSTEVE Son-of-a-gun. We'll find the corporal and we'll find the telegram. \nHe stops, takes out a cigarette, offers one to Rode, lights them both, gives Rode the packet.  They smoke for a moment. \nSTEVE But I need documentary proof. You know of anything like that? \nRODE No. But that's why we hated him. We admired him as a conductor but we all hated him too because he didn't have to join the Party and yet he had a better life than any of us. He didn't have to go and deliver a report after every trip abroad. He got everything from them, everything. He was filthier than any of us Party members. \nThe sun is setting. Rode stops suddenly. \nRODE There's a rumour... I don't know if it's true or not... but ask him about von der Null. \nSTEVE Never heard of him, who is he? \nRODE Edwin von der Null. Music critic. He gave Furtw\u00e4ngler terrible reviews while he raved about Herbert von Karajan. \nSTEVE Who's he? \nRODE Also a conductor. Very brilliant. Young. Von der Null called him 'The Miracle von Karajan'. Furtw\u00e4ngler was outraged and they say he had von der Null conscripted into the army. The same thing happened to another critic. True or not, it's not such a bad idea. Critics give you bad reviews, you have them sent to the Russian front. (Chuckks.) But if you really want to get Furtw\u00e4ngler, ask him about Herbert von Karajan. \nSTEVE The Miracle Kid. \nRODE Yes, yes you may notice that he cannot even bring himself to utter his name, he... he refers to him as K. \nMARTIN That's the evidence of a guy named Dahlerus. He's a Swede. Friend of Hermann Goering. I want you to study it. And I want you to use it. \nDavid tries to sneeze but fails; he starts to read. \nMARTIN We're going to find more stuff to feed you. We'll have some other suggestions. We need to build a case for the defence - based not on feelings, not on prejudice, but on facts. \nHe watches David read. David is engrossed. Almost imperceptibly, he shakes his head. \nEXT. BERLIN STREET - DAY \nA half-ruined caf\u00e9 with tables on the sidewalk. WERNER, the timpanist, SCHLEE, the oboist, and two others seated at one of the tables, drinking coffee. \nDavid carries an attach\u00e9 case and walks towards the caf\u00e9. He scans the people at the tables, sees the musicians and approaches. They stand. \nWERNER Lieutenant Wills. \nDavid nods \nWERNER Herr Schlee, timpanist, Herr Romer, cello and Herr Schmidt, viola. They are willing to help. We have already ordered ourselves coffee. I hope you... \nDAVID Yeah, of course. \nWERNER The whole orchestra will vouch for him. He was always there to support us. \nDAVID We need names, if possible with addresses, because it's urgent. Names of musicians saved by Dr. Furtw\u00e4ngler, people he helped to escape abroad. Let's go somewhere public. \nDavid leaves money on the table and then walks off with the four men. They talk as they make their way down a side street. \nINT. DYMSHITZ'S VILLA - NIGHT \nSteve and Dymshitz sit opposite each other and clink vodka glasses.  They have been drinking but are not yet drunk. \nDYMSHITZ To co-operation. \nThey drink. Dymshitz pours more vodka. \nSTEVE I was in Vienna. I had with me an Austrian chauffeur, Max his name was, he spent time in the camps. We were looking at these Viennese cleaning up the bomb damage, scavenging for rotting food, butt ends, anything. I said, 'To think a million of these people came out to welcome Adolf on the day he entered the city, a million of 'em, and now look at 'em.'  And Max said, 'Oh, not these people, Major. These people were all at home hiding Jews in their attics.' You get the point, Colonel? The point is they're all full of shit. \nDYMSHITZ Furtw\u00e4ngler's in a different category. \nSTEVE We're dealing with degenerates here. \nHe is still for a moment, then grabs the bottle and pours himself a drink, downs it. Dymshitz watches him, then: \nDYMSHITZ Degenerates? \nSTEVE I have a duty. \nDYMSHITZ (flaring) Duty? I am sorry, duty? Duty fucking duty. Trouble is, you Americans want everybody to live like you. We liberated Berlin, Major Steve, not you. Our duty also is to bring back the best of German culture. \nDymshitz bursts out laughing. \nStung, Steve advances on him, almost as if he's about to attack him physically. He stops, sways a little, then, after a moment, drops down in a chair near to Dymshitz. They drink. Intimate: \nSTEVE I'm gonna get that fucking bandleader, Colonel. No deal. No fucking deal. \nDYMSHITZ Then you're going to kill me. \nINT. STEVE'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nDrunk, Steve is clumsily, almost frantically, threading film into the 16-mm projector. \nHe switches off the lights then stumbles back to the projector, turns it on and directs its beam towards a blank square of watt. \nIt's an American military propaganda film. \nARCHIVES You'll see ruins, you'll see flowers, you'll see some mighty pretty scenery, don't let it fool you. You are in enemy country. The Nazi party may be gone, but Nazi thinking, Nazi training and Nazi trickery remain. Somewhere in this Germany are two million ex-Nazi officials. Out of power but still in there and thinking, thinking about next time. Remember that only yesterday every business, every profession was part of Hitler's system. Practically every German was part of the Nazi network. They believed they were born to be masters. Don't argue with them. You are not being sent Germany as educators. You're a soldier on guard. You will observe their local laws, respect their costumes and religion and you will respect their property rights. You will not be friendly. You will be aloof, watchful and suspicious. \nSteve, swaying slightly, watches, with the film continuing. \nEXT.  FLEA MARKET - DAY \nBright summer's day. Emmi pushing her way through the crowded market. She comes to the stall with gramophone records. \nDavid is with her, staying behind a little so as not to disturb her. \nShe starts to look through the records, blowing her nose from time to time. Then she finds a box of records, opens it, is delighted. She bargains with the stallholder, and she hands over money. \nShe shows her purchase to David happily. They struggle on in the crowd. David suddenly stops. He has spotted a tandem. The bicycle with two seats is old and rusty but seems to be in working order. David steps up to it, touches it. \nEXT. WOODLAND - DAY \nTwo persons, Emmi and David, riding the tandem. Emmi in the front, pedalling, David behind. The road going up into the hills is full of potholes. They change seats. David is in the front, Emmi at the back. Suddenly the road begins to descend. They change again, Emmi sits in the front, David at the back. They speed down the hill. \nINT. BURNT-OUT DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY \nThe tandem, ridden by Emmi and David, rolls into a huge building, black and burnt out. \nIn the middle of the vast hall, surrounded by the staircase, there is a Christmas tree, almost burnt to cinder. Emmi and David stare at it, mesmerised. \nDAVID Yesterday I read that Furtw\u00e4ngler was asked to lead the New York Philharmonic back in '36, Toscanini suggested it. Had he accepted, he would have become the most celebrated conductor in America. \nINT. STEVE'S OFFICE - DAY \nDavid and Emmi look at him, puzzled. \nShe goes to the door, opens it, nods. Rode quickly disappears.  Furtw\u00e4ngler looks at Emmi. \nFURTW\u00c4NGLER What is this man doing here? \nEmmi doesn't answer. All eyes on the door.  Furtw\u00e4ngler enters. \nSTEVE Dr. Furtw\u00e4ngler!  Come in, come in, sit down. \nFurtw\u00e4ngler, deeply suspicious, goes for the uncomfortable chair. \nSTEVE No, no, take this one, it's more comfortable \nHe holds the other chair for Furtw\u00e4ngler, who sits. \nSTEVE If it's too hot, open your tie. \nFURTW\u00c4NGLER (interrupting) I wish to say something. \nSTEVE Go ahead, be my guest. \nFurtw\u00e4ngler takes from his pocket a piece of paper with notes. He blows his nose. The room is warming up. It will become like an airless court room, a pressure cooker. \nFURTW\u00c4NGLER When I last saw you, I was unprepared. I did not know what to expect. In these past weeks, I have been thinking more carefully and making some notes. (glances at the notes.) You have to understand who I am and what I am. I am a musician and I believe in music. I am an artist and I believe in art. Art in general, and music, in particular, has for me mystical powers which nurture man's spiritual needs. I must confess, however, to being extremely naive.  I insisted for many years on the absolute separation of art and politics. My entire life was devoted to music because, and this is very important, because I thought that I could, through music, do something practical. \nSTEVE And what was that? \nFURTW\u00c4NGLER Maintain liberty, humanity and justice. \nSTEVE Gee, that's a thing of beauty, honest to God, a real thing of beauty. I'm going to try to remember that. Liberty, humanity and justice. Beautiful. But you used the word 'naive'. Are you now saying you think you were wrong? That art and politics can't be separated? \nFURTW\u00c4NGLER I believe art and politics should be separate, but that they weren't kept separate I learned to my cost. \nSTEVE And when did you first learn that - when you sent the telegram? Was that the surrender signal, the waving of the white flag? \nFURTW\u00c4NGLER What telegram? \nSTEVE 'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.' \nFURTW\u00c4NGLER I have no idea what you're talking about. \nSTEVE The birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, Adolf Hider. \nSTEVE You sure you didn't call one of your close buddies and say, God in heaven, did you see what that guy von der Null wrote about me? The greatest conductor on earth. I want him out the way. He had the nerve to accuse me I am not playing enough modern music. Send him to Stalingrad. Isn't that what you did? You don't like criticism, do you, Wilhelm?  You surely didn't like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you... Are you saying the name von der Null was never mentioned in your talks with Goebbels? \nFURTW\u00c4NGLER (uncomfortable) Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me. \nSTEVE And what did he say? \nFURTW\u00c4NGLER He said, 'Don't mind him. His job is to criticise, your job is to conduct.' \nSTEVE And what happened to Von der Nul? \nFURTW\u00c4NGLER I have no idea. \nSTEVE You've really no idea? I'll tell you what happened. He died in Stalingrad. \nFURTW\u00c4NGLER I'm sorry. \nSTEVE Now, that young conductor what's his name? (playing with Furtw\u00e4ngler) That miracle kid, you know who I mean. Von Karajan! But you called him something else. C'mon. What did you call von Karajan? \nSilence. \nSTEVE Say it. \nSilence. \nSTEVE I'll say it, then. 'Little K.' Is that right? You couldn't even bear to say his name! \nFurtw\u00e4ngler rises angrily and starts to pace. \nFURTW\u00c4NGLER Please stop playing these games with me. Why you should bring up the name of another conductor is beyond my understanding. \nSTEVE I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked? \nFURTW\u00c4NGLER Yes, that's what happened. \nHe sits heavily, wipes his brow. He is sweating now. \nSTEVE I have a different story to tell. I don't think you were tricked. Not in the way you describe. I believe something else happened. I've seen the Hinkel Archive, I've seen records of phone calls, and putting it all together, this is what I think happened. I think Goebbels said, 'Wilhelm, if you won't conduct for Adolf's birthday, we'll get the Miracle Kid, the guy that critic, von der Null, thinks is the greatest conductor in the world. He's not just willing to conduct for Adolf, he's offered to sing \"Happy Birthday\" as a solo.' \nSilence. \nSTEVE Come on, admit it. K worried you, didn't he? He always worried you. In 1942, he's thirty-four years old, you're already fifty-six. And Goebbels and Goering keep saying to you, 'If you don't do it, little K will.' Never mind art and politics and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit about liberty, humanity and justice because I don't care how great you are. It's the oldest story in the book, (a wry look at David) The ageing Romeo jealous of the young buck. The real reason you didn't leave the country when you knew you should have was that you were frightened that, once you were out of the way, you'd be supplanted by the Miracle Kid, the Party's boy twice over, flashy, talented little K. \nFURTW\u00c4NGLER This is absolute nonsense! \nSTEVE Well, I'm just beginning to develop my theme. Isn't that what you call it in classical music, developing your theme? Okay, so they played on your insecurity. That's human, understandable. But, there is one guy who doesn't like little K as much as he likes you - yeah, the number one man your old pal, Adolf. He thinks you're the greatest, and when he says, I want Wilhelm for my birthday, boy, they better go out get Wilhelm. So, Josef calls and threatens you with little K. And you said to hell with the Ninth in Vienna, I'll give it to Adolf as a birthday present in Berlin. That's the trick they played, they got you by the balls and they squeezed. Hard. Why did you stay? Why did you play for them? Why were you the flag-carrier for their regime?  Jealousy? \nFURTW\u00c4NGLER I don't understand what you mean. \nSTEVE No, that's your problem, Wilhelm. You understand nothing. We'll call you. Go! \nFurtw\u00e4ngler leaves. \nDAVID Major. \nSteve goes to his desk and, as Furtw\u00e4ngler rises uncertainly: \nSTEVE What? \nDAVID Your manner. \nSTEVE My manner? Why don't you go downstairs, get a cup of coffee and calm down? What's the matter, Emmi? What's going on with you? What's wrong? \nEMMI I'm sorry but I have to leave. I'll find other work. You'll have to get someone else, that's all. \nSTEVE What is this, Emmi? \nEMMI I can't do this. It's not right. \nSTEVE What's not right? \nEMMI I have been questioned by the Gestapo just like that. Just like you questioned him. \nSTEVE Emmi, stop! I want to show you something. Let me show you something and then if you want to leave, you can leave, please please. His friends, they did this. And he gave them birthday concerts. \nEMMI But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested. \nSTEVE If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving? This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country? Why, if people had no idea? \nEMMI I would like to go now, please. \nBut Steve turns on the projector and the Bergen-Belsen film flickers into life. \nINT. US OFFICERS' CLUB - NIGHT \nBand playing. Couples dancing. David and Steve at the bar, each with a drink in front of them, lost in their own thoughts. Then: \nSteve signs to the barkeeper to fill their glasses but David puts a hand over his glass. Then: \nDAVID Can I ask you a favour, Major? \nSTEVE Yeah. \nDAVID This is a transcript of the proceedings at Nuremberg. A Swedish businessman, Birger Dahlerus, testified in cross- examination that he had several meetings with Hermann Goering. 'I first saw Goering,' Dahlerus testified, 'embroiled in a stormy interview with Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler, the famous conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic, who was vainly seeking permission to keep his Jewish concert master. \nHolds up his package of letters and dumps them on Emmi's desk. \nDAVID Emmi, pick one of these, any one, read it out loud. \nEmmi is uncertain. Steve shrugs indifferently. \nShe picks an envelope and takes out the letter. \nEMMI (reading) 'Please remember that Dr. Furtw\u00e4ngler risked his life to help anyone who asked him. I personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help. He never turned anyone away. After he heard me play... I am a violinist... he gave me money because I was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to Sweden. He helped countless people in similar ways.' \nDAVID And this, only one of these letters, Major. I have lots of them. \nSTEVE (smiling) How many times have I got to tell you I was in insurance? You think I can't smell a phoney policy when it's shoved under my nose? Sure, he helped Jews, but that was just insurance, his cover, because all the while he was maestro of all he surveyed, (turning on Furtw\u00e4ngler) See, Wilhelm, I think you're their boy, their creature. You were like an advertising slogan for them: this is what we produce, the greatest conductor in the world. And you went along with it. The truth of the matter is, Wilhelm, you didn't need to be a member of the Party. I made a mistake when I asked you for your Party number. I should've asked you for your non- Party number. Just like some other well-known artists. (suddenly, to Emmi) Emmi, put that record on. \nEmmi puts on the record of the Adagio from Bruckner's Seventh Symphony. After a moment: \nSTEVE Do you know what that is? \nFURTW\u00c4NGLER Of course I know what that is. \nSTEVE Okay, so what is it? \nFURTW\u00c4NGLER Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio. \nSTEVE Who's conducting? \nFURTWANGLBR I am. \nSTEVE You know the last time it was played on these air waves? \nFURTW\u00c4NGLER How can I know such a thing? \nSTEVE I'll tell you, then. The last time this music was played on these air waves was after they announced that your pal Hitler had shot himself. Listen to it.  They listen. Did they pick little K's recording? Did they pick some other conductor? No, they picked you, and why? Because you represented them so beautifully. When the Devil died, they wanted his bandleader to conduct the funeral march. You were everything to them. \nThe music plays. \nFURTW\u00c4NGLER (near to breakdown but struggling for control) I have always tried to analyse myself carefully and closely. In staying here, I believed I walked a tightrope between exile and the gallows. You seem to be blaming me for not having allowed myself to be hanged. \nDavid takes the record off. \nFURTW\u00c4NGLER I didn't directly oppose the Party because I told myself, that was not my job. If I had taken any active part in politics I could not have remained here. But as a musician, I am more than a citizen. I am a citizen of this country in that eternal sense to which the genius of great music testifies. I know that a single performance of a great masterpiece was a stronger and more vital negation of the spirit of Buchenwald and Auschwitz than words. \nAn uncontrollable surge of anger wells up in Steve, causing him to pace alarmingly. He grabs the baton from his desk, stands trembling before Furtw\u00e4ngler, and snaps it in half. \n", "test1_input": "Steve starts to unpack his attache case. \nEMMI Then there have been three calls from Dr. Furtw\u00e4ngler wanting to know when you wish to see him. I did not speak to him personally... \nShe hands Steve a typewritten sheet. He ignores it, finds a list which he hands to her. He waits for her to read, then: \nSTEVE Think you can get me any of that? \nEMMI (pleased) Oh yes, Major, I have recordings of all his symphonies. I kept them safe during the bombing. My favourite is the Seventh Symphony. \nSTEVE Mine's the Eleventh. \nEMMI (puzzled) But... he only wrote nine, Major. \nSTEVE I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a record player? You have that, too? \nEMMI No. Ours was damaged. \nSTEVE (surveys the room) What's in those files? \nEMMI The names of the members of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra since 1934 together with their questionnaires.  Major, what am I to tell Dr. Furtw\u00e4ngler? \nSTEVE You tell him nothing, Emmi. If he calls again, you say you know nothing. We're gonna keep him waiting while I get acquainted with his case and with the witnesses. And, God help me, with Beethoven. \nHe smiles. She tries to smile back. \nEXT. FLEA MARKET, BERLIN - DAY \nFreezing weather. A narrow street, crowded, busy, noisy. Some makeshift stalls set out, trestle tables, open suitcases, people buying and selling every imaginable commodity. \nEmmi wanders through the crowd, passing a violinist, Helmuth Rode, wrapped up against the cold, playing Handel's Air on a G String, a bowl for money at his feet. A passer-by drops a cigarette butt in it.  Immediately, Rode retrieves the butt. \nEmmi comes to a stall selling piles of gramophone records. She asks the stallholder a question. He points to another stall across the way. \nINT. STEVE'S OFFICE - DAY \nSteve at his desk, paging through files. A knock on the door. \nSTEVE Yeah. \nLieutenant DAVID WILLS, aged twenty-four, enters, comes to Steve's desk, stands to attention, salutes. \nDAVID Lieutenant Wills reporting to Major Arnold. Sir. \nSTEVE For Chrissakes I hate that shit, cut it out. \n", "test1_true": "STEVE I'm Steve. What's your name? \nDAVID David. David Wills. I'm your liaison officer with the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs Committee. Sir. \nSTEVE Sounds a lot of run. (studies David.) So they sent the big guns to check up on me. We recruiting children now? \nDAVID (smiles') I guess so, sir. \nSTEVE You call me sir again and I'll make you listen to Beethoven. \nDavid half-smiles. \nSTEVE Where you from, David? \nDAVID was born here, in Leipzig. I escaped in '36. My parents, they sent me to my uncle in Philadelphia. They were to follow. But they delayed and... \nBreaks off. Nothing from Steve. \nDAVID Our family name was Weill. But that doesn't sound well in English. My uncle changed it to Wills and... \nThe door opens and Emmi enters carrying a record player, sees David and starts to back out. \nEMMI I'm sorry. \nSTEVE Come in, Emmi, this is your office, too. Emmi, this is Lieutenant David Wills. \nThey nod briefly. \nSTEVE He is here to watch over us. \nA flick from Emmi. \nSTEVE I guess you admire musicians. \nDAVID Some. \nSTEVE Don't. This is like a criminal investigation, David. Musicians, morticians, doctors, lawyers, butchers, clerks. They're all the same. \nFor Emmi's benefit too. She becomes still, listens. \nSTEVE We have a duty, a moral duty. \nDavid takes a few files, sits and starts to look through them. Steve returns to his files. Emmi, by now, has put on a record and starts to play it: the opening of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony blasts out. \n", "test2_input": "GREEN We can't drop a case just like that. \nDYMSHITZ I'll give you another conductor in exchange or writer, musician, actor what...what do you care?  But I like Furtw\u00e4ngler. He's my favourite conductor. (chuckles.) Mine and Hitler's. He's our favourite conductor. \nINT. WAITING ROOM - DAY \nRode is seated, waiting. Nervous, tense. The sound of laughter, David's laughter from the office. It makes him even more uncomfortable. \nINT. STEVE'S OFFICE SUITE - DAY \nEmmi and David laughing. \nDAVID I clicked my heels, saluted and bowed at the same time. \nHe demonstrates. She laughs again. \nEMMI That's because you had a proper upbringing. \nDAVID That's right. I was raised very strictly. So don't speak before you are spoken to! \nEMMI Oh! And don't wave your hands about! \nDAVID Respect your elders and your betters! \nEMMI And no elbows on the table! \nDAVID Eating is eating... and... \nEMMI And talking is talking! Well, I think we better get on. \nDAVID Right. So, this is going to be very formal, too, now. Lieutenant David Wills requests die pleasure of die company of Fraulein Emmi Straube at dinner any night she cares. \nShe smiles just as Steve bursts in. He's in a bright, cheerful, energetic mood. \nDavid draws back guiltily. Emmi, embarrassed, hesitates then turns to the typewriter and types furiously. Seeing this, Steve stops, but just for a brief moment. Then, as he goes to his desk: \nSTEVE David, need to ask you something. You heard this rumour the British found something called the Hinkel Archive? \nDAVID Yes. \nSTEVE So what is it? \nDAVID The British occupy the building where this guy, Hinkel, ran the Nazi Ministry of Culture and it seems they've... they've discovered his secret archive. \nSTEVE What's that mean? \n", "test2_true": "STEVE Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies? \nDAVID Major Richards said he'd call to let us know. \nSTEVE That's big of him. \nHe looks from David to Emmi as if trying to work out something.  Then: \nSTEVE Okay, better question the next witness. I bet you a bottle of French champagne he tells us the baton story inside ten minutes. \nDAVID Five minutes. \nSTEVE It's a bet. You're the witness, Emmi. \nLater. \nRode in the witness chair. Steve studying the file. David and Emmi ready to take notes. \nSTEVE Helmuth Alfred Rode. Second violinist since 1935. What's it mean, second violinist? \nRODE It means I wasn't good enough to be a first violinist. \nHe chuckles, looks around for approval. Steve grins encouragingly. \nSTEVE Good, and according to your questionnaire, Helmuth, you never joined the Nazi Party. \nRODE Me? Never.  Never. \nLong silence. \nRODE I... I know everyone now says they were never Nazis but in my case it is absolutely one hundred per cent true. I am a Catholic, it would have been totally against my conscience. \nSilence. \nSteve lights a cigarette; Rode eyes it hungrily. \nRODE Is it true you're going to interview Dr. Furtw\u00e4ngler today? \nSTEVE I'll ask the questions, Helmuth. \nRODE Excuse me. Did you know that he refused to give the Nazi salute when Hitler was present in the audience? \nSteve flicks David a glance, waggles his finger like a baton. \n", "test3_input": "Rode looks around nervously, lowers his arm. \nSTEVE And I see what you mean. You nearly poked my eyes out. \nRODE Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case. \nSTEVE Don't worry, Helmuth, it'll be our secret. \nA ball comes bounding towards them. Steve catches it. Then a BOY runs in, looks hopeful. \nBOY Mister, mister, here, here, mister!!! \nSteve tosses the ball back to him. \nSTEVE Great catch, kid. The boy runs off. \nRODE So. You wanted to see me. \nSteve pats the spot next to him and Rode sits. \nRODE You usually don't work on Sunday, Major? \nSTEVE All in the cause of humanity, Helmuth. Or should I call you one- zero-four-nine-three-three-one? \nRODE What? \nSTEVE One-zero-four-nine-three-three- one. Or d'you mind if I just call you 'one'? \nRode makes an attempt to go but Steve grabs him. \nSTEVE You know what I say you are, Helmuth? I say you're a piece of shit. \nRode suddenly starts to retch. \nRODE That bastard! \nPeople by the lakeside: \nFaces turning at Rode's sobs. Impassive. Blank. \nSteve and Rode: \nSTEVE Who's the bastard, Helmuth? Hinkel? \nRode nods. \n", "test3_true": "Rode vomits. \nSTEVE And what about before that? What were you a member of in Austria? \nAfter a moment: \nSTEVE Was a member of...?  Speak up? \nRODE (barely audible) I was a member of the Communist Party. I was a communist. That's what Hinkel had over me. He knew everything. He held that over me. That's how he made me co-operate. \nSTEVE Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again? \nRODE (angry) You don't know what it's like to wake up every single morning of your life terrified, you don't know that - (he stops.) \nBrief silence. Steve stands. \nFurther along the lakeside: \nSteve and Rode walk. People about. Boats on the lake. \nRODE I would never, in my wildest dreams, have ever been a second violinist in the Berlin Philharmonic. When they got rid of the... the Jews in the orchestra, it gave people like me a chance. \nEXT. LAKE - DAY \nRode rowing Steve in a small boat. Rode, exhausted, stops. The boat drifts. Steve watches him for a moment, then: \nSTEVE Helmuth, you ever heard of plea- bargaining? \nRode, trying to catch his breath, shakes his head. \nSTEVE Talk about power, I have the power to give you work, make your life easier. Your past won't be mentioned. I could give you a job tomorrow but I have to get something in return. See, Helmuth? That's plea-bargaining. \nNo response. Rode keeps his head bowed. \nSTEVE I can give you freedom of movement, freedom to work, freedom, Helmuth. But I need something in return. \nRODE Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want... \nSTEVE Fuck that, Helmuth. You want to discuss symbols here?  This guy was a front man. He was the piper, but he played their tune, you get my philosophical meaning?  I'm not interested in small fish, I'm after Moby Dick. Come on, Helmuth. Hard facts. \nSilence. Then Rode slowly raises his head. \nRODE The only thing I know is he's an anti-Semite. \n"}

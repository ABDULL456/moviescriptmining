Rob steps forward and lifts the painting off the wall. Behind it is an inset bookcase. Sitting on one of the shelves, at the proper height to have lined up with the holes in the portrait, is a child's Felix-the- cat nursery clock. The eyes of the plastic cat move back and forth, like a pendulum marking seconds. 
INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Rob sets the painting on the floor outside their bedroom door, leaning it up against the wall. 
CAMERA DOLLIES IN for a CLOSE UP of the portrait. It looks much creepier with the now vacant eye sockets. 
INT. ROB AND KIT'S ROOM - NIGHT 
They are undressing on opposite sides of the bed. The silence between them is thick enough to be cut with a knife. Kit sits down slowly on the edge of the bed and quietly slips under the covers. Rob gets in on his side. 
They sit in silence for a moment, making no move to join each other in the middle of the bed. 
KIT Rob? 
No answer. 
KIT You still angry with me? About dinner? 
ROB No. I'm sorry. I'm not angry with you. I'm just angry. 
He leans over, turns off the bedside lamp... and the light in the bathroom comes on. Beat. 
He gets out of bed and crosses to the bathroom, reaches in and turns off the light... ...and the overhead light comes on. Kit starts to laugh and quickly covers her mouth. Rob walks to the door, turns off the overhead light... 
...and the bedside lamp comes on again. Kit laughs harder, but still tries to stifle it. 
Rob shoots her a look, then goes and sits on the edge of the bed. He reaches to turn off the bedside lamp again, then thinks better of it and starts to unscrew the bulb instead. 
ROB (burning his fingers) Ouch! Jesus! 
Kit can't stop herself any longer. She laughs out loud. Rob perseveres, finally unscrewing the bulb enough to plunge the room into darkness. 
Silence. 
ROB Very funny. 
Kit breaks up laughing again. To her it is funny. And soon Rob is laughing too. He swings his legs up under the covers beside her. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Muffy turns off the last of the lights downstairs, leaving the porch light on for Skip. 
INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT 
Muffy moves through the quiet to her room. Arch grabs her. She jumps. 
MUFFY (COLLECTS HERSELF) Arch do you know what time it is? 
ARCH Um-hmm. 
MUFFY (turning down his collar) Goodnight, Arch. 
Gently but firmly, she extricates herself, closing the bedroom door behind her. ARCH 
Undaunted, he scuttles down the hall to Rob and Kit's closed door to listen in. He frowns, the slides farther down to Nikki's room, knocks once softly, and enters. 
HIS POV 
Nikki is already occupied, however, with Chaz. She catches Arch's stare, signalling him to get the hell out. 
REVERSE 
Arch valorously steps back, closing the door and returning to try Nan. 
The light underneath her door flicks off, however. The door is also locked. 
Arch curses, returning to his large but empty room. He slams the door for everybody's benefit. 
INT. MUFFY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Muffy, undressing, hears, and smiles. 
INT. ARCH'S ROOM - NIGHT Arch is pacing the bedroom, horny and alone. He gets an idea, goes and rummages through Chaz' stuff and comes up with a video cassette of a porno movie. 
Carrying -the cassette he crosses to the door and turns the handle. The doorknob comes off in his hand. 
He throws it down in disgust, goes and sits in a chair and broods. The chair collapses beneath him.

{"test1_input": "At that moment SILUS appears at the door. \nSilus stares at Lilly, bleeding to death in Jones' arms. Silus immediately bends to her. With his free hand Jones pulls out a vicious knife which he points at Silus. \nJONES (continuing) Get away from her! \nBut Silus ignores the knife and moves closer to Lilly. \nJONES (continuing) Get away or I'll stick you! \nSILUS Do you want me to save her? \nJones wavers. \nSILUS (continuing) She is dying. \nJones backs the knife away. Silus whips   his hand to the blade of the knife, slashing his wrist, blood   immediately issuing from the wound. He presses his bleeding   wrist to Lilly's mouth. At first resistant, Lilly begins   to suck at the wrist. Jones is appalled. \nSilus then leans close to Lilly and whispers in her ear. All the other noises in the soundtrack drop out. \nSILUS (continuing) Lilly. Stop fighting now. Fall back, fall back... \nSlowly she does. Silus removes his wrist from Lilly's mouth. She is silent, comatose. \nA medical team now scramble through the door, pushing past Silus and the bloody Jones and begin to work on Lilly. For a moment Silus and Jones stare at each other. Then Silus turns to the ventilation shaft in the corner. He closes his eyes. Listens. \nDOMINIC He's getting away!! \nSILUS Quiet. \nThe cops are silent. Stare at Silus who opens his eyes. \nSILUS (continuing) He's going up. \nWe move in on Silus' ear. Closer, closer. Into his ear. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n46 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, VENTILATION SHAFT - NIGHT           46 \nThe long shaft and in the distance Edgar approaching, his eyes reflective, moving with the speed of an insect through the shaft, his bloody mouth. \nCut to \nSilus, now also in the shaft, his gun out, moving forward. He turns a corner. The shaft is empty. He waits, watching, listening. He hears a scuffling. \nCut to \nEdgar, the same, turning a corner to see Silus approaching him. Silus raises his gun. A puff emits from the end of his gun. The projectile hurtles towards Edgar, who just ducks out of the way in time. \nEdgar turns. There is a grill next to him. He smashes it with his foot. \nCut to \nSilus approaching the junction, turning the corner, just in time to see Edgar's legs pass through the hole. \n46A INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, HALL - CONTINUING                  46A \nWe see Jones move into the hall, looking at the roof, searching. Then he looks at Lilly's blood which covers his hands. He pockets his stun weapon and pulls out his own dangerous looking gun. \nCut to \n47 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, DIFFERENT FLOOR - NIGHT             47 \nA door bursts open. Edgar - in slow motion - crashes through the door and into the hall. The sound track is a huge driving slab of choral orchestral music. \nThe camera tracks back as he starts to mount the wall, his momentum carrying him diving towards the camera. \nCut to \nSilus enters the empty hall. No Edgar. Then he sees in the roof, a manhole cover, slightly ajar. \n", "test1_true": "48 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, CEILING CAVITY - NIGHT             48 \nSilus' POV as he climbs into the crawl space, its ceiling following the pitch of the roof. It is dark and extends for a long way. Silus squats in the sub light like a beautifully dressed animal. \nWhat he can't see are two blinking eyes above him in the rafters of the dark roof. It is Edgar. Edgar drops, Silus turns too late as the weight of Edgar drives into him, sending both of them through the floor of the ceiling cavity and down... \n49 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, ANOTHER HALL - NIGHT               49 \n...to fall, a dead weight, crashing down onto the floor of the hall in a hail of debris. Edgar is on top of Silus and strangling him, and then he stops and turns. \nHe moves just in time to avoid a bullet from Jones' gun which glances Edgar's cheek, sending off a wisp of burnt colored smoke. \nCut to \nJones. Gun smoking, standing at the other end of the hall. \nEdgar screams the scream of something from the animal kingdom. Then turns and runs. \nCut to \nSilus rising, pulling out his gun. Jones points his gun, but Silus is obscuring his view. \nCut to \nEdgar runs away down the hall. \nThen on Silus. Very still, very silent. Close on his finger pressing the trigger. \nThe camera zooms right into the interior of the gun to see the projectile entering the gun's chamber and the hammer igniting it. \nThe projectile explodes out the end of the gun. \nHigh Angle of the projectile flying towards its target, the ceiling lights above streaking past on its reflective surface, cruel mechanical claws suddenly slide out from the side of the capsule. \nThen Edgar, camera tracking back at high speed. \nSlow move in on Silus' cool gray eyes. \nThen whack! The projectile stabs into Edgar's back, the claws springing forward to hook onto Edgar's flesh, we see the fluid within the transparent projectile flow into Edgar, see Edgar's eyes widen, see his POV of the approaching window then... \nCrash. Edgar's head implants itself in the wall below the window, the dust and debris from the wall board drifting over Edgar's numb stare. \nIn the background Silus stands. Motionless. \nWe see Jones walking forward, gun still pointing, heading towards Edgar. Silus turns and steps in front of him. \nJONES Get out of my way. \nSILUS No. \nJones stares at Silus and contemplates firing. \nJONES He killed Lilly. \nSilus doesn't move. He stares calmly at Jones. \nJones points the gun in Silus' face. \nBeat. \nJONES (continuing) Bang. \nJones lowers his gun.

She stares ahead at the approaching figure, who has now stopped, after bumping into a pedestrian. Lilly continues forward, closer, closer. From under the hooded jacket the glistening eyes of the man ahead catches hers for a moment. The man now begins to approach her, his hand pulling something from his jacket, going for something. A gun. \nLilly immediately pulls her gun. The mist beads on the shining barrel of her gun. The man is raising his hand towards her. \nLILLY Police. Put your hands where I can see them! \nThe man now lurches forward, his hand rising towards Lilly, her finger begins to caress the trigger of her gun, as the man looms closer. And then he is gone. \nCut to \nThe man slamming against the wet wall of a building, grasping at the hands that now threaten to throttle him. \nAnd we see Silus, his hands on the man's throat, and for only the second time, we see anger in Silus' eyes. \nPeople in the street scatter as more Brothers emerge with guns pointed. And Lilly, shaking, pointing her gun at the man Silus is holding. On the ground, next to the man, she sees what he had in his hand. A pamphlet. Asking people to come to church service; a picture of a Brother priest serenely beaming out from it. \nMeanwhile the man that Silus has is gagging on the ground, Silus' hand still on his throat. He's begging. \nPARISHONER Holy brother, please... \nLilly grabs Silus' shoulder. \nLILLY Let him go. \nShe shows Silus the pamphlet. \nLILLY (continuing) He's harmless. Let him go. \nThe man now pulls back his hood. He is black, his large, watery eyes stare up in awe at Silus. He grabs Silus' hand which now relaxes and draws Silus' ring to his lips, kissing it, in tears. \nPARISHONER Forgive me. I've offended you... \nWe see Silus' dark stare. \nA beat. \nThen Silus reaches out and places his hand on the man's head. \nSILUS No. You are divine. It is the world that offends me. \nSilus rises, the Parishioner just lays there in awe. Silus now turns to Lilly who is on his shoulder. And now Lilly realizes for the first time that it is Silus. \nLILLY Brother Silus. What's going on? \nWe then hear a police siren and a car pulls up through the rain. The door opens and Jones emerges, taking in both Lilly and Silus. A grim smile of realization comes to Jones' face. He pulls something from his jacket. \nCut to \n81 INT: LILLY'S APARTMENT, LOUNGE - NIGHT                     81 \nSteph's ID is tossed down on a table. \nJONES (off) A shopkeeper heard yelling. Went to see, found this. One witness. A prostitute. \nJones tosses down a photo. It is Freddy, looking suitably scummy in a police identikit photo. \nJONES (continuing) She identified this lovely citizen. We thought maybe he had a grudge or was crazy. I guess we were wrong. \nSilus stands by the window; lights make patterns on his face. \nSILUS It is Edgar. \nLILLY And now he's got Steph. Why does he want her? \nSILUS She is not what he was after. \nWe see Lilly slowly getting it. \nLILLY Steph was staying with me. She was wearing my coat. It was me he was after. Wasn't it? \nSilus now turns, slowly moves towards her,   coming out of the shadows. Lilly finds it hard to return his   gaze, involuntarily touches her neck where it is   scarred from Edgar's attack. Jones is watching all this   very carefully. \n", "test2_true": "JONES Right, then we put you somewhere safe and set up this place. Shooters on the roofs. And when he comes we blow his fucking brains out. \nSILUS He will know. He will see and hear it. \nLilly is staring at Steph's ID. \nLILLY It has to be me. That's what he wants. It's the only chance Steph's got. \nJONES What are you talking about, she's probably dead already... \nLILLY Jones! And we can't make it too hard. He has to be able to get in. He can't suspect anything. \nJones is shaking his head. Silus just stares at Lilly. \nLILLY (continuing) That's the way it will be. I'm the bait. \nClose on Silus. \n82 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT - SUNSET                    82 \nWe are in a large, derelict warehouse; detritus and stacked and smashed wooden crates. Music is playing somewhere in the distance from a phonograph. We track through the space. Daylight comes through cracks in the blacked out windows high above, creating tiny shafts of laser light that flicker from the dust. \nWe pass through the stacks of crates that are like a high walled maze. Music emits from a stereo, loud. We continue to move down a hall. Through the detritus, towards a door. A hand opens the door. \n83 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT, CELL - CONTINUING          83 \nIn the corner of the room, huddled, chained to the floor, is Steph. She does not look good. In fact she looks very sick. There are tubes coming off her arm. \nFreddy stoops down and begins to check the tubes running from her arm. There are small taps on the tubes. He turns them on. Blood begins to flow from her into a cup that is already stained red. As he turns it off Steph shivers, her eyes open. The whites of her eyes are blood red; she is sick. She speaks, weakly. \nSTEPH Help me. Please, I'm sick. Help me. \nShe reaches for Freddy, but he pulls away. Freddy's not looking too hot either. \nFREDDY Don't fucking touch me. \nHe picks up the half filled cup and leaves. Steph stares after him. Tears welling in her eyes, beginning to shake now, moving against the chains that bind her. But they stay fast. \n84 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT - CONTINUING                84 \nFreddy moves into the large warehouse space, the music still echoing. Freddy looks around, searching for Edgar. \nFREDDY Hey! \nHis voice echoes through the empty space. \nFREDDY (continuing) Where've you gone now? \n85 EXT: LILLY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                           85 \nA POV, wavering slightly, the hint of a whispering breath. We see Lilly's apartment. The shot zooms in at high velocity, searching the windows, zooming in here to check the lock on this window, then on that. Then the shot wildly pans and twists to the street below. Again it zooms in, to the entrance of the building, to a couple walking past in the night, as if searching for any sign of something out of the ordinary. We can hear the couples voices, talking about inane things. \nCut to Edgar's face in the shadows. His eyes reflective, his whole being readied and concentrating. He closes his eyes. We move around to end close on his ear, the soundtrack becoming stark as the sounds of the night become eerily separated and distinct. One sound in particular, a kind of metal sound, scratching slightly, growing louder. \nEdgar's eyes open. \nCut to \nA zoom speeding towards Lilly's bedroom window, then swooping at the last minute to end on an apartment one floor down. \nAnd there, gently moving in the night air, a partially open window, the latch grinding in the breeze. \nCut to \n86 INT: LILLY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUING                         86 \nA whiz pan POV, ending on the lounge of Lilly's apartment; as if we just caught the last part of someone turning their head, as if alerted. All the lights are out. We slowly begin to move forward, dipping and gliding silently, into the hallway. Slowly we approach a doorway and creep into... \n87 INT: LILLY'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - CONTINUING                87 \n", "test2_id": 433, "test3_input": "116 EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, QUARANTINE ZONE - NIGHT             116 \nCut to a crane down to reveal Silus and Jones observing the guards at the blockade. \nJONES You'll never get in, they've circled the whole borough. \nSilus turns to Jones. \nSILUS I will get in. You must go to the press. Tell them about the water. Tell them what the government will do. \nJONES You're dead after this. You know that? Whatever happens. \nSilus smiles. \nSILUS Watch for me, Officer Jones. \nSilus exits. Jones watches him leave, then Jones leaves too. \n117 EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, QUARANTINE ZONE - CONTINUOUS         117 \nWe see Silus, close. It's as if he is meditating. We pull out to reveal he is kneeling on the roof of a building; he looks as if he's preparing himself for something. \nHe then rises, all fluid concentration, and runs towards us and then the camera is on his shoulder as he jumps off the roof. \nCut to \nSilus' POV falling down down, falling towards a window then smashing through it. \n117A EXT: OMITTED - CONTINUING                                117A \n118 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, QUARANTINE ZONE - CONTINUOUS     118 \nSilus exploding onto the floor of the apartment. For a moment there is silence, just glass tinkling, Silus poised. Then Silus turns and is gone. \nCut to \n119 EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, QUARANTINE ZONE - CONTINUOUS         119 \nThe slums are wrapped in smoke and haze from fires that burn there; an eerie dead zone, made all the stranger by the gothic spires that climb out of the haze. \nThen Silus hears something. It is the wailing of a new born child. Silus moves towards the cries, then up ahead he sees a figure, kneeling on the ground. As Silus moves through the haze he sees what it is. It is a Brother Priest, kneeling beside someone. The Brother is holding the hand of the person on the ground who is in the last throws of death. When Silus is next to him the Priest looks up at him. Tears wet his cheeks. For a moment they just stare at each other. \nPRIEST 2 Who has done this, Brother? \nSILUS We have. To our shame. \nThe Silus hears the babies cries again. Closer now. The Priest stares at the dying creature on the ground in front of him. Drops the limp hand he was holding. Then rises and turns squarely to Silus. \nPRIEST 2 I have something to show you. \nThe Priest moves off towards a building and Silus follows. \nCut to \n119A INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, QUARANTINE ZONE, HOVEL - CONTINUING    119A \nWe see Silus and the Priest enter. The Priest leads Silus into the dark place. As he moves forward Silus can hear a strange gurgling sound; not of the sick or dying, this is a more innocent sound. The sounds of a newborn. \nWe See Silus approach a filthy, roughly made crib. In it is a baby; it's eyes stare up at Silus with wisdom beyond their years. \nPRIEST 2 It is a miracle my Brother. She is a female, the first of our kind. \nSilus watches the baby carefully. \nSILUS She must be protected. \nHe then turns to the Priest. \nSILUS (continuing) I would ask for your help Brother. The Church can no longer be trusted... \n119B EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT - CONTINUING                   119B \n", "test3_true": "Cut to \n120 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT, CELL - CONTINUING          120 \nLilly, in her cell. She is working the chains that bind her hands against the pipe. She's rubbing them desperately, harder, harder. Then she stops. She can hear someone approaching. \nEdgar appears in the doorway; still and poised. Then he turns, listening. A creaking echoes through the tunnels as if an iron door, somewhere above, has been opened. \nEDGAR He's coming little one. He's coming for you. \nEdgar takes one more blinking look at Lilly and then leaves, slamming the large iron door behind him. \nLilly pulls at the chains, hoping against hope that they'll break. They don't. \nLILLY No. \nShe now looks above. The pipe her chains are connected to runs up towards the roof, then takes a bend to disappear into the wall near the door. She bangs on the pipe. There is a little movement where it goes into the wall. Just enough to give her some hope. \nLilly struggles now to her feet. She slides the chains up. To get the chains over the bend she'll have to jump. She does, sliding the chain over the bend. Now she hangs from the pipe, the chains cutting into her wrists viciously, making her groan. She then gets her hands on the pipe and begins sliding along the pipe until she is near the door. She then reaches up with her feet and kicks at the wall, pushing, trying to dislodge the pipe. It moves, water leaks from it. But it does not give way. \nA desperate beat. Then she reaches down to the door with her foot. She tries to force down the door handle, her foot wet and slippery. Finally she gets the handle down, opens the door so that it clangs against the wall. \nLILLY (continuing) Hello! I'm down here. Silus... \nHer hands slip from the pipe and again the chains bite into her wrist. She cries out in pain. \nCut to \n121 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT - CONTINUING                 121 \nAbove we see Silus, stopping. Lilly's cries echo through the place. It is a wet maze of grease and rust, ornate twisting pipes built long ago and now decrepit. Silus waits, listens. Then something. \nCut to \nFeet, moving fast, splashing in a pool of black water. \nSilus turns, just catching a movement, a flash of someone moving off through the distorted piping. He moves to where he saw the figure, to catch sight of a person moving to an open iron doorway. \nSILUS Lilly? \nBut when the woman turns it is not Lilly. It is one of the infected; the red eyes, mad and staring at him. And both he and the creature hear it. Cries, of someone in pain. Lilly. \nCut to \n121A INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT, STAIRWELL - CONTINUING     121A \nLilly's cries echo up the stairwell, up towards the surface. \nCut to \n121B INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT, CELL - CONTINUING          121B \nLilly twisting on the chains that bind her to the pipe, crying out in pain. \nCut to \n121C INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT                             121C \nThe creature moving through the doorway towards the sounds of Lilly's cries. Silus now moves forward to get to the creature, flying towards the doorway. We see him approaching the doorway and then from nowhere Edgar slams into Silus, sending them both careening over a railing. \n121D INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT, STAIRWELL - CONTINUING     121D \nLow Angle looking directly up at the two Brothers fall, bouncing and crashing off the rails on the way down. \n121E INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT, STEAMROOM - CONTINUING       121E \nThey both hit the wet stone floor. They are in the pipe room where subterranean mineral springs rise up from deep in the earth and where the boroughs water supply is sterilized. \nSilus is stunned, rises, blood issuing from his mouth. Silus pulls his gun from his coat, but Edgar's kick is too fast, whipping the gun away so that the glass instrument smashes against some dripping pipes. Edgar then squares off against Silus. \n", "test3_id": 434}

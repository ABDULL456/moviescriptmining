{"train": "PERFECT CREATURE \nWritten by \nGlenn Standring \nSHOOTING SCRIPT \n14 May 2004 \n1A EXT: PROLOGUE ON BLACK - NIGHT \nThe screen is black, music evoking religion and danger begins. \nLILLY For three hundred years the great plagues have swept the earth. Diseases created from the experiments of the Alchemists. \nWe see death tolls appear through this graphically. \nThe plague - 5 million souls. Virulent Small Pox - 10 million. Mutated Influenza 30 Million Souls... \nLilly Thinking they had discovered Gods secret code for life, the Alchemists experimented with genetic science. They had no idea what they had unleashed. \nWe begin to see a strange medallion sweeping through smoke, slowly revealing itself. \nLILLY (CONT'D) (continuing) ...but there was also a miracle. One of these plagues helped nature create a new kind of being. At first they were called Nosferatu, or Vampire and were feared. But they were not supernatural monsters, just a better version of ourselves. They were the Brothers, and their religion and science helped sustain us against the plagues and influenzas that have ravaged Europe and the rest of the colonies. For 300 years our two races have lived in harmony. Until now... \nFADE UP: \n2 INT: DOCTORS SURGERY - DAY                                2 \nWe are very close on a bespectacled eye. It stares at us and then looks down. \nGENETIC DOCTOR (off) See here. This is what you need to look for. \nCut to the object in the Genetic Doctors hand; it is like an x-ray, yet the image looks remarkably like a DNA profile. \nGENETIC DOCTOR (continuing; off) A genetic mutation, we all carry it. But we now know a virus activates it. \nWe reveal the genetic Doctor, sitting at his desk, smoking a cigarette. The surgery and the clothes suggest the year, yet there are small things that are different, not what you'd expect to be around at this time. Standing next to him in the dusty haze of the room is a younger doctor; an apprentice who looks attentive. \nGENETIC DOCTOR (continuing) This Virus plays some unknown role in the birth the Brothers. Of course the mutation occurs very rarely these days. And only in males. \nThe apprentice nods and then looks up. There is someone else in the room. A woman - who we now see is pregnant. There is something about her that suggests more a prisoner or psychiatric patient than a normal pregnant mother. \nGENETIC DOCTOR (continuing) Strange isn't? \nApprentice   DOCTOR Strange? \nGENETIC DOCTOR That God would choose such humble vehicle for a miracle. The mothers invariably come from the slums, we don't know why. (to the woman) This is your 7th isn't it? \nWe see the woman; she's like a hollow person, hardly aware of where she is. The Doctor shuffles papers. Finds what he wants. \nGENETIC DOCTOR (continuing) Yes, her first was successful, a Brother was born. Thereafter variously malformed offspring. We can only hope this one will be different. (to woman) You'll have to try harder this time. \nThe woman now looks up. And tentatively speaks. \nWOMAN IN THE SURGURY Please... \nGENETIC DOCTOR What is it? \nWOMAN IN THE SURGURY Please... I want to keep my baby. They always take my babies away. \nGENETIC DOCTOR Don't be stupid woman! \nThe woman drops her eyes. We see the Apprentice Doctor, almost pitying the poor woman. \nApprentice DOCTOR (to woman) You won't have to worry. The Brotherhood will take him... \nWe are closer on the woman now. Tears begin to glisten in her eyes as we drift closer to her. \nApprentice DOCTOR (continuing; off) ...raise him in the church, teach him. He's special. You should be proud. It's a blessing really, he'll want for nothing. Not like the rest of us? \nA drain pipe, leaking. \nCut to \nSilus once more. This time we can hear \"plop, plop, plop.\" \nCut to \nA pool of water. Then \"plop\" as a drop hits it. The drop is not water. The drop is a red liquid, thick, now dispersing in the water. And another drop, \"plop.\" High speed CRANE UP from \nthis pool, up up the side of a building to end on a FACE in the shadows. We can see reflective, gleaming eyes. And a mouth, with blood dripping from it. \nCut to \nSilus again. His eyes flicking open; we see the footpath reflected in those perfect light gray eyes. \nMusic - brooding, ancient - begins to hum as Silus slowly rises, as if his limbs have the power to make him float, so perfect and powerful are they. A small smile has appeared on his lips; it is the smile of a man who knows that something very dark, something very dangerous, is close by. \nSlowly his hand slips into his jacket. He holds it there, watching, surveying the street immediately ahead of him for the slightest movement. He sees it. On the wall of an old Georgian Mansion across the road, a shape on the side of the wall, almost imperceptible, hidden in the shadows and brickwork. A CREATURE on the side of the wall. \nSilus begins to move forward now, everything in perfect shining silver slow motion. As he moves forward he pulls a gun from his jacket - it is silver, organic and glass, art nouveaux styling - and points it ahead of him as he glides forward. \nThe creature on the wall senses the movement coming towards it, moves a little and then, like a spider, scrambles along the side of the wall, heading away from us. \nSilus fires. A bullet of silver explodes from the gun, seems almost to hang in the air for a moment, reflecting the moon above, before hurtling at high speed towards its target. \nThe shell explodes the wall next to the creature, who stops suddenly in the light so that we can see it. \nA man. With reflective animal eyes and blood on his purple lips. And teeth; the teeth of a vampire. This creature immediately dives from the wall to the ground, just avoiding another two bullets that crash into the wall. \nLA as the man falls directly towards the camera. \nSilus now rushes forward, holding his gun out in front of him; he moves forward gracefully. He can see the man skillfully climbing up an adjacent derelict building. Silus tries to follow but his way is blocked by wire and fencing. He raises his gun towards the man once more, but he is gone. \nClose on Silus' enigmatic face. Those eyes. And in his mouth, two perfectly pointed fangs. \nCut to \n6 EXT: CAFE - NIGHT                                          6 \nWe are outside a cafe; the cafe is a warm glow against the cold night. We see past the fine falling rain - through the large glass window that has swirling silver art nouveaux designs lacing across it - to a table inside, by the window, where two pristinely dressed men sit. \nCut to \n7 INT: CAFE - NIGHT                                          7 \nWe are inside. Closer on the two men. One is SILUS. The other man is AUGUSTUS; the man we saw in the operation theatre before. Augustus has hardly aged at all. \nAUGUSTUS The girl? \nWe see Silus. He remembers. \nCut to \n8 INT: ROOM, FLASHBACK - NIGHT                               8 \nFlashback from Silus' memory; a dead girl on a bed, blood splattered across her pillow. \nCut to \n9 INT: CAFE - NIGHT                                           9 \nSilus' face. Pull out to reveal we're back in the caf\u00e9. \nSILUS \nIt is taken care of. \nAUGUSTUS This is good. \nSILUS Augustus. We failed this girl. We asked her to help us catch him, and then we failed her. \n12 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, TENEMENT, HALLWAY - LATER             12 \nThe hallway again. The other two men we saw entering at the beginning are talking to the woman with the mop. One of the men is taking notes. \nWe pan to the office, to see Lilly and Jones standing before the Slum Landlord, who is now wrapped in a towel and sitting in a chair. \nSLUM LANDLORD I don't know nothing about it. I give 'em out. Make sure everyone gets 'em. \nJONES That's a lie! We know you've been trading influenza vaccine in the workhouses! \nAnother man now approaches Lilly. \nFRANK Lil'. I think you should see this. \n13 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, TENEMENT, HALLWAY - CONTINUING        13 \nHalfway down the hall there is a door, Frank opens it displaying a set of stairs leading down. \nFRANK I'd use the mask if I were you. \nLilly pulls a dark surgical-type mask over her face, then slowly moves down the steps into the oblivion below. \n14 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, TENEMENT BASEMENT - CONTINUING        14 \nCut between Lilly's POV and her face, her eyes glimmering in the sub-light as she moves down the stairs very carefully. \nAnd finally the horror is revealed. In this basement there are 10 or 12 people, lying on the floor. Most of them are silent, but a couple moan. One, a woman, pleads to Lilly. \nWOMAN IN THE BASEMENT Help me. Please help. \nThe woman extends her arm. It is covered in sweat; grimy. The glands at the side of the woman's neck are distended and swollen, her eyes bloodshot. \nWOMAN IN THE BASEMENT (continuing) Please. I'm sick. Please. \nThe room is a version of hell. Lilly's eyes glisten. \nCut to \n15 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, TENEMENT OFFICE - CONTINUING           15 \nJones has the Slum Landlord by the throat. \nJONES You're a fucking liar! \nSLUM LANDLORD No, no, I swear it, I gave 'em their boosters, both of 'em. I'm a responsible landlord, I swear to god. There must've been something wrong with them vaccines. \nLilly stares at the Slum Landlord; shock in her face, and anger. \nJONES This is a civil health violation! You're going to the hell house for this. You can forget lovely Doris here where you're going. \nWe see the woman who was screaming before, the prostitute; she makes an obscene gesture at Jones. As this is going on Frank and the other man we've seen are tearing the place apart, looking for something. They don't find it and Frank's look tells Lilly so. \nLilly's face is a mask. She is watching the Slum Landlord very carefully. He keeps looking down; strangely, nervously. \nSLUM LANDLORD I don't know what you're on about. I've done nothing, I swear to god, I've done nothing. \nLilly lets her eyes drift down, all the way down to the chair legs, which rock unevenly on the floor. Lilly is staring at the scratched, worn floor boards which MOVE. \nCut to \nFrank, prizing back the floor boards. Jones restrains the Slum Landlord. Lilly watches. Frank pulls the floor boards away easily. We see that hidden in the floor cavity are packets of something. Frank pulls them out. \nRips one of the plastic bags open. In it are packets with the words \"Jamestown Borough - Civilian Influenza Vaccination.\" Frank holds it up for Lilly to see. \nThe Slum Landlord is now looking three ways at once. \nLilly slowly begins to approach the Slum Landlord. \nLILLY It is my pleasure to inform you that you are under arrest for trafficking influenza vaccine. \nSLUM LANDLORD I want my lawyer. \n20A INT: LILLY'S APARTMENT, CHILDS BEDROOM - CONTINUING         20A \nLilly approaches a room and we see inside it. It is empty apart from a stripped bed and some boxes. \nLilly flips the lid on one of the boxes. She picks up a toy; a pink fairy princess with wings, the paint on its face worn. \nLilly winds a key and the wings of the doll flutter, accompanied by the whining sound of the internal mechanics. \nWe see Lilly's face as she stares at the doll. Emotion fights to claw its way out from under her skin, but she doesn't let it. \nThen in the distance we hear a child's cries. It almost sounds like memories wafting through the air, but the stamping of feet from the apartment above makes it plain that the noises come from there; the sound of children playing. \nCut to \n21 INT: LILLY'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT                     21 \nLilly enters her bedroom. The place is a mess. She sits on the bed. She picks up a framed photo which sits on a sideboard next to the bed. It shows Lilly, a man - Lilly's age - and a child of 5 years who looks a lot like Lilly. She stares at the child. We hear the sound of rain pounding against the window of the bedroom. \n22 EXT: LILLY'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT                     22 \nPull out to reveal the exterior window. We can see through the window into Lilly's apartment again, see Lilly lying down, hugging the photo. The rain has become a light mist. \n23 EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, STREET - NIGHT                         23 \nWe are close on a poster. It shows a perfect face, serenely beaming out; it could be Silus or Augustus, except this man is dressed in religious regalia, like a priest. The poster says \"The Brotherhood loves you. You are divine.\" We begin to crane off the poster which is revealed to be stuck on a lamp post. The street is seething, the slums of Jamestown. \nA young boy, perhaps seven; spiked up hair, face covered in grime, grime from dragging himself up in this hellish place. He carries a bag filled with the detritus he's picked from the rubbish bins of the rich. He wears a distinctive red t-shirt that is several sizes too big. He moves along the street, avoiding a disinterested passersby. As he passes an alley he hears something. An animal-like growl. He stops. \nDown the alley he can see two figures. One is a male. He is clutching another clothed figure; female. \nKID Hey?! Hey! \nAt that instant the man turns to the boy. There, half seen in the slick shadows, the most piercing eyes, a bloody mouth, with fangs, hissing. The creature drops the woman and scales the sheer wall of the alleyway; clutching various handholds, up four flights, then gone. \nThe kid, frightened, now makes to run off but bangs into a passerby. The man grabs the kid roughly. \nMAN IN THE STREET Where are you going in such a hurry my little ruffian? Pilfering by the look of you? \nThe kid struggles and the Man now sees the shape of the woman in the alleyway, slumped to the ground. \nMAN IN THE STREET (continuing) What's going on here? What'd you do to her? \nKID Don't, I didn't do nothing. It was a Brother. It was a Brother did it. \nThe man moves forward, dragging the kid. And he sees the woman there, deathly white in the alley. Dead eyes staring. \nMAN IN THE STREET Oh dear god... \nCut to \n24 INT: NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM - DAY                           24 \nWe track past a sign that says \"Museum of Spiritual Selection and Alchemistry.\" In the distance we can see a group of people in the hazy light. \nCut to \nAugustus - the man we saw with Silus earlier - sitting on a chair surrounded by various objects. At his feet are a gaggle of school children, aged around ten; affluent looking, human. Augustus points to a strange, ancient looking glass apparatus. \nAUGUSTUS 300 years ago, with these simple instruments, the alchemist Guiseppi De Angelo discovered what we today call genetic science. \nAUGUSTUS (continuing) He deciphered that the Brothers were a new race of beings, sent by god, to serve and protect you. \nWe see the faces of the children, rapt. \nAUGUSTUS (continuing) De Angelo formed the church of the Brotherhood. He was a great great man, but there were others, bad men, who took what De Angelo had discovered and experimented without concern for the results. The science of genetics and all its power has been banned ever since. Who can tell me what came from these bad experiments? \nOne child puts his hand up. Behind the child, in the distance, Augustus now sees Silus approaching; Silus obviously wants to talk to Augustus. Augustus points to the child while looking at Silus. \nAUGUSTUS (continuing) Yes. \nCHILD All the bad things. Like bad germs and flu. \nCut to \nHis POV approaching a grill. A subdued light comes through it. The POV approaches and sees into the apartment below. \n37 INT: ROOM, SAME BUILDING - NIGHT                            37 \nA woman, around 20, attractive, brushing her hair. She has just had a shower. She sits. \nCut to \nThe shaft. We see Edgar's hand enter shot. His hand grips the bottom of the grill and tries to open it. It doesn't budge. \nCut to \nInside the room, the woman turns and looks up at the grill. She thinks she's heard something. She stares; waits. She gets up and moves towards the grill high above on the wall. She places a chair under it, then gets up on it, standing on tip toes, trying to see if there's anything behind the grill. Her hand reaches out and tries the grill, to see if it's secure. \nThen she leans closer to it. Her face pressed right up against it. Closer. Closer. \nCut to \nEdgar's white face, lurching into shot. Staring, staring. \nCut to \nHis POV. He is now looking through a different grill. This time there is a young man inside an apartment. Doing exercises. \nEdgar watches. And again that chilling smile. \nWe see the man again, who gets up and preens himself in front of a mirror. \nClose on Edgar's eyes, devouring the sight of this pumped up flesh. The young man exits the room, going into a bathroom. \nWe see Edgar's hand trying to open the grill. It moves. \nCut to \n38 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, HALL - NIGHT                       38 \nFrank and Abernathy are on fifth floor, finishing a sweep of it. As they move they hear a CRASH. They stop. Then another crash, coming from the floor up. Then a SCREAM. \nThey look at each other, then begin to run to the stairwell, as Frank talks into his RT. \nFRANK Lil'! Lil'! \nCut to \n38A INT: POLICE VAN - CONTINUING                                38A \nLILLY Frank. \nFRANK (off) He's on the sixth floor! He's on the sixth floor! \nLILLY Let's go. \nEveryone fires into action and begins to exit the van. \n39 EXT: JAMESTOWN, BRIDGE SQUARE, ROOF - NIGHT                  39 \nSilus watches from his vantage point. He can see Lilly and her team below rushing into the building adjacent to him. And then he sees, through one of the windows on the sixth floor, the flashes of gunfire. \nCut to \n40 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, STAIR WELL - NIGHT                  40 \nHandheld camera with Lilly and her crew rushing up the stairwell; up up. \nCut to \n41 OMITTED                                                      41 \n42 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, BRIDGE SQUARE, HALL - NIGHT         42 \nAt that moment SILUS appears at the door. \nSilus stares at Lilly, bleeding to death in Jones' arms. Silus immediately bends to her. With his free hand Jones pulls out a vicious knife which he points at Silus. \nJONES (continuing) Get away from her! \nBut Silus ignores the knife and moves closer to Lilly. \nJONES (continuing) Get away or I'll stick you! \nSILUS Do you want me to save her? \nJones wavers. \nSILUS (continuing) She is dying. \nJones backs the knife away. Silus whips   his hand to the blade of the knife, slashing his wrist, blood   immediately issuing from the wound. He presses his bleeding   wrist to Lilly's mouth. At first resistant, Lilly begins   to suck at the wrist. Jones is appalled. \nSilus then leans close to Lilly and whispers in her ear. All the other noises in the soundtrack drop out. \nSILUS (continuing) Lilly. Stop fighting now. Fall back, fall back... \nSlowly she does. Silus removes his wrist from Lilly's mouth. She is silent, comatose. \nA medical team now scramble through the door, pushing past Silus and the bloody Jones and begin to work on Lilly. For a moment Silus and Jones stare at each other. Then Silus turns to the ventilation shaft in the corner. He closes his eyes. Listens. \nDOMINIC He's getting away!! \nSILUS Quiet. \nThe cops are silent. Stare at Silus who opens his eyes. \nSILUS (continuing) He's going up. \nWe move in on Silus' ear. Closer, closer. Into his ear. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n46 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, VENTILATION SHAFT - NIGHT           46 \nThe long shaft and in the distance Edgar approaching, his eyes reflective, moving with the speed of an insect through the shaft, his bloody mouth. \nCut to \nSilus, now also in the shaft, his gun out, moving forward. He turns a corner. The shaft is empty. He waits, watching, listening. He hears a scuffling. \nCut to \nEdgar, the same, turning a corner to see Silus approaching him. Silus raises his gun. A puff emits from the end of his gun. The projectile hurtles towards Edgar, who just ducks out of the way in time. \nEdgar turns. There is a grill next to him. He smashes it with his foot. \nCut to \nSilus approaching the junction, turning the corner, just in time to see Edgar's legs pass through the hole. \n46A INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, HALL - CONTINUING                  46A \nWe see Jones move into the hall, looking at the roof, searching. Then he looks at Lilly's blood which covers his hands. He pockets his stun weapon and pulls out his own dangerous looking gun. \nCut to \n47 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, DIFFERENT FLOOR - NIGHT             47 \nA door bursts open. Edgar - in slow motion - crashes through the door and into the hall. The sound track is a huge driving slab of choral orchestral music. \nThe camera tracks back as he starts to mount the wall, his momentum carrying him diving towards the camera. \nCut to \nSilus enters the empty hall. No Edgar. Then he sees in the roof, a manhole cover, slightly ajar. \n50A INT: SFX - CONTINUING                                      50A \nBlack. Voices in the dark, quiet at first, then growing more frightening; then the hint of a face, in negative - Edgar - then screams, like the screams of an animal on the hunt. And another face, alternating with Edgar's. Silus. \nCUT TO: \n51 INT: HOSPITAL, LILLY'S WARD - DAY                           51 \nHigh Angle of Lilly asleep, lying on a hospital bed. We drift down. Again there is rain, pounding against the window. Her body flinches; she is in a dream, a nightmare. As we drift closer to her, her eyes open, staring straight up and then to the left. Then grim recognition. \nCut to Low Angle on Silus standing above her, examining the tube that runs a clear fluid into her in a slow drip. \nLILLY Antibiotics. They say it's like an animal bite. \nSilus nods. He slowly sits on the bed. \nLILLY (continuing) I want to thank you. \nSILUS We all caught Edgar. \nLILLY I don't mean that. The blood, they say it saved my life. Is it true that people who go to church are given your blood? \nSILUS Sometimes the rituals call for it. Some say they have visions from it. That it restores their health. \nSilus regards her and she him. She reaches out and touches his hand, almost retracts at the smooth texture of the skin. \nLILLY So smooth. \nShe turns over his hand to reveal the wrist; the scars are almost gone from where Silus cut himself. \nLILLY (continuing) Healed already. \nSILUS In some ways my body is like a human embryo. The cells regenerate quickly. It is why we live so long. Will someone come for you? Your family? \nShe releases his hand. \nLILLY I don't have one. Not any more. \nSILUS I see. \nLILLY Influenza. My husband was quick. But my daughter, Mary, her little body fought it for a long time. So I just waited. Hoped. But then you realize how cruel hope is. And you just want it to end. Not to stop her suffering, but to stop my own. \nSILUS I am sorry. \nLILLY Do we seem pathetic to you? \nSILUS No. Fragile. Worn down by nature. But you fight back. \nLILLY Yes. We're good at that. \nLilly stares up into Silus' serene face. Silus smiles. Then stands. \nSILUS I think yours will be a good life to watch, Lilly. Goodbye. \nLilly tries to smile as Silus turns and walks off down the ward. \nClose on Lilly who looks grim. Then she turns to the window. Rain again, blowing hard against the pane. \n52 INT: HOSPITAL,LILLY'S WARD - CONTINUOUS                      52 \nAs Silus leaves the ward he passes Jones, who's been standing there as if he's been watching them. A beat. Then Jones shoves a newspaper into Silus' hands. \nJONES Nicely done. You're more human than I thought. \nJones unceremoniously pushes past Silus and moves into Lilly's room. Silus reads the newspaper. The story tells of the recent deaths in Jamestown, explaining that it was an insane man who thought he was a Brother. The man's picture is shown; it is actually one of the victims. \nThrough the window in the doorway Silus watches Jones approach Lilly. We are close on his enigmatic face. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n52A EXT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, FOYER - DAY- Establisher         52A \nSilus places his hand on the poor creature's head, blessing her. \nPROFESSOR LIEPSKY (continuing) And Edgar may be the first Brother to ever die. \nPROFESSOR LIEPSKY (continuing) Before that, his brain will wither like these women. Containment will be the issue. \nCut to \n57 INT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, CELL ANTEROOM - CONTINUING       57 \nA door slamming behind Silus, he is in a strangely, eerily lit cubicle. \nSILUS (off) The police officer. Lilly. Did he infect her with this? \nPROFESSOR LIEPSKY (off) No. She was lucky. But it is in Edgar's blood. It always will be. \n...and another door in front of Silus clicks, then slides open to reveal... \n58 INT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, CELL - CONTINUING                58 \nEdgar, sitting in the chair. He immediately turns to the door, his eyes burrowing straight into Silus. \nSilus moves forward. We track, Silus' POV, toward Edgar and the reality of his predicament is revealed. \nThere are metal rods extending from the cage around him. Two at the sides. Two from the front. They strategically pointed at Edgar's chest and sides. If he was to try to get up, they would pierce him. \nSILUS Hello my Brother. \nWe can now see Edgar for the first time in something approaching a normal state. He looks similar to Silus, perhaps not quite so perfect. He radiates confident primeval power; less a man captured than an animal waiting. Edgar is smiles. He shifts a little, we see the rods piercing his flesh. \nEDGAR Do you like what they've done for me Silus? \nHe moves again, as if enjoying it. \nSILUS You are sick. We will help you if we can. \nEDGAR Help me? I am being what I was meant to be. How can you help me from that? Or do you want to tame me? Brainwash me? Animal or vegetable, are those the two choices, Silus? \nEdgar leans closer to Silus. \nEDGAR (continuing) I want to share the feeling with you. To feel their blood flow until every last drop is yours, until that weak, pointless little pump finally stops. \nThey are staring at each other very intently now. Edgar smiles gently. \nEDGAR (continuing) The one I had, the police woman. She was so strong. I found it hard to leave her. \nEdgar moves. \nEDGAR (continuing) Is she dead? \nSILUS She survived. \nEDGAR Good. I will have her again. \nFor perhaps the first time, we see a real hint of anger on Silus' face. \nSILUS You won't touch her. \nEdgar looks at his brother for a moment. Edgar's features are a paradox; almost sympathy for Silus followed by understanding. Then he smiles. \nEDGAR You've chosen to watch over her. You want her don't you? I can see it in your eyes. You are like me. \nSilus' control has returned now. \nSILUS I will pray for your cure, Brother. \nSilus then turns and leaves. \nEDGAR I wont be able to forgive you for this you know? Not ever. In fact, when I get out of here... \nHe moves violently, blood seeping from his wounds now. \nCut to \n65 INT: LILLY'S APARTMENT - DAY                                 65 \nWe track through Lilly's apartment, silently. We enter the lounge to see Lilly sitting on a couch watching a strange looking valve powered globular Television-like device. We track ominously up behind her. Then stop. \nJONES (off) I knocked. \nLilly turns to Jones. \nLILLY You nearly gave me a heart attack. \nSteph now emerges from the kitchen, dressed in a t-shirt and shorts and carrying some food. Jones looks at her coldly. \nJONES What's this then? \nLilly and Steph smile at the inference Jones is beginning to draw. \nSTEPH My apartment was condemned, keep your hair on, what's left of it. \nMeanwhile Lilly shushes them and turns back to the murky gray images emitting from the television. \nTV PRESENTER ...the ascension through the ranks of the Church has been fast for Brother Silus. He will now be the highest ranking cardinal outside the ruling council of the Brotherhood. This is largely seen as a reward for his handling of the last influenza pandemic. \nJones and Lilly watch as Silus is seen on the television in an interview. Steph stares at the screen with awe, she involuntarily kisses the symbol that hangs from a chain around her neck; it resembles a Brother's ring. \nSTEPH Isn't he amazing? \nJones sneers under his breath. \nJONES A saint. \nLILLY Quiet. \nWe move over their shoulders to track closer to the black and white TV screen. \nTV PRESENTER You have been an opponent of those who want an easing in the ban on genetic research. \nSILUS Yes. \nTV PRESENTER They would say you're denying legitimate research into a science that would change the world. \nSILUS The church does not deny the potential. Only the motivations of those who want to exploit it. And the fact that we understand so little of its power. \nTV PRESENTER With the elimination of influenza, are we approaching a new era where disease might be a thing of the past? \nAs she is saying this we are now close on the TV's speaker. We then begin tracking out. We reveal the speaker is not part of the TV, but the speaker in Edgar's cell. Edgar, smiling coldly as he listens. As he listens he is gently gliding his finger nails against a sharp edge of the chair; sharpening them. \nSILUS Disease is part of nature, it will always be a part of our lives. \nClose on Edgar. \nEDGAR How true. \nTV PRESENTER (off) Brother Silus' confirmation ceremony will be held today in the sacred Chapel of St. Augustine where all the Brotherhood will gather. \nEdgar listens, smiles. \n66 INT: CEREMONIAL CHAPEL - DAY                                 66 \nAn ornate door; ancient, with strange, beautiful dark symbols carved into the old wood, like something out of a castle in Prague. The doors open and we see a large chapel. And within the large dark interior, lit by great long candles, the Brotherhood have gathered. They all stare at the camera, which we reveal is Silus' POV. \nWe see SILUS. Unchanged, still the perfect creature he has always been. But for now the suit has gone and instead he stands draped in fine ropes, robes that carry his life on them; achievements, his rank, which is now high. \nIn the distance, at an alter, stands AUGUSTUS. He is also in his gowns. A gong sounds and the Brothers, in unison with the music, begin to chant; it is eerie, it sounds like Tibetan monks. \n67 OMITTED                                                     67 THRU                                                             THRU \n70 INT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, SECURITY CONTROL ROOM -           70 CONTINUING \nProfessor Liepsky, looking more aged, worn, enters the control room. Alarms are sounding. At the console is a human male who looks terrified. \nCut to \nThe Receptionist; she's trying desperately to place a call. We see the shadow from a figure cast over her and she turns and looks up, fear making her shake now. \nCut to \nEdgar, staring down at her. \nEDGAR You won't be taking any more calls today. \nCut to \n76 INT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, HALL - LATER                    76 \nSlow steadicam along the underground halls. We see the bodies of Edgar's victims being cleaned up by personnel. We stop. In the distance we see the door to Edgar's cell open. \nCut to Silus, observing the scene. The lighting is intermittent, flickering. Augustus is standing next to Silus, the weird light of the hallway reflecting in his eyes. \nAUGUSTUS Now he carries this thing out into the world. Can you imagine what will happen if he infects others? Or if the experiments were known. \nWe are left with Silus' beautiful, reflective eyes. \nSILUS The question becomes what will he do next? He said he would kill us all. But especially the police officer. Lilly. \nCut to \n77 INT: JAMESTOWN SUBWAY - SUNSET                             77 \nFlashing lights of subway trains screaming through subway tunnels, wheels screeching as metal grinds on metal. \n78 INT: JAMESTOWN SUBWAY EXIT - CONTINUING                    78 \nThe streets are flooding like Bangkok in the monsoon; rain pouring off awnings that hang out over the street. The streets are full; prostitutes, drug peddlers, apothecary shops, the industrial revolution low down and dirty. There is a fight breaking out between two men who are dressed like punk rockers. \nSeveral people are alighting from a subway exit; the exit has \"Jamestown/Brougham\" on a nouveaux styled sign that might remind you of a Paris or Barcelona metro, only dirtier. \nWe see Lilly in the distance, in her dark jacket, emerge from the subway. She begins the short walk to her apartment. The streets are crowded and there are plenty of Maori people in this area, so there's plenty of food stalls; the air is filled with the sound of evening prayers. Lilly stops at one of the food stalls and starts picking up vegetables. A Maori man comes out and smiles and they start talking in the local dialect. She buys a live eel. \nCut to \nAcross the street, in a doorway, we see a very weedy, sick looking guy - this is Freddy. Standing next to him is a Prostitute, swaying from the effects of laudanum. \nPROSTITUTE Come on governor, you going to pay me or not? \nFREDDY Soon enough my cherub. I've not finished with you yet. \nHe sucks on something that looks like a ventaline inhaler, then pockets it, licks his lips and begins heading off down the street, the drunk Prostitute dragged along. \nCut to \nAgain, Lilly from a distance, walking along the street which is more deserted, now carrying a bag full of groceries. As she walks we begin to hear voices; violent, arguing. Lilly approaches an alleyway, the raised voices becoming louder. She slowly places her bag on the ground and then pulls out a revolver. She edges into the alleyway. \n79 EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, ALLEYWAY - CONTINUING                  79 \nLilly's POV down the alleyway. It seems empty. The POV moves in a little and there in an offshoot of the alleyway we can see Freddy. He is standing over a woman who cowers; she's \nplainly a prostitute. Freddy points a gun at her head. \nFREDDY You've been ripping me off! I should blow your dirty little brains out! \nSTEPH (off) Police! Put the gun down now! \nAnd now we see, it's not Lilly we've been watching, but Steph. She points her gun at Freddy. Freddy turns to Steph. He slowly raises his arms. \nFREDDY It's ok. I'm complying officer, see. \nSTEPH Put the gun on the ground and step away! \nFREDDY I'm doing it. \nFreddy puts the gun down. The Prostitute on the ground now scrambles to her feet and heads towards Steph. \nLilly now slowly slips her hand into her jacket, her gun a cold hard presence in her hand. She stares ahead at the approaching figure, who has now stopped, after bumping into a pedestrian. Lilly continues forward, closer, closer. From under the hooded jacket the glistening eyes of the man ahead catches hers for a moment. The man now begins to approach her, his hand pulling something from his jacket, going for something. A gun. \nLilly immediately pulls her gun. The mist beads on the shining barrel of her gun. The man is raising his hand towards her. \nLILLY Police. Put your hands where I can see them! \nThe man now lurches forward, his hand rising towards Lilly, her finger begins to caress the trigger of her gun, as the man looms closer. And then he is gone. \nCut to \nThe man slamming against the wet wall of a building, grasping at the hands that now threaten to throttle him. \nAnd we see Silus, his hands on the man's throat, and for only the second time, we see anger in Silus' eyes. \nPeople in the street scatter as more Brothers emerge with guns pointed. And Lilly, shaking, pointing her gun at the man Silus is holding. On the ground, next to the man, she sees what he had in his hand. A pamphlet. Asking people to come to church service; a picture of a Brother priest serenely beaming out from it. \nMeanwhile the man that Silus has is gagging on the ground, Silus' hand still on his throat. He's begging. \nPARISHONER Holy brother, please... \nLilly grabs Silus' shoulder. \nLILLY Let him go. \nShe shows Silus the pamphlet. \nLILLY (continuing) He's harmless. Let him go. \nThe man now pulls back his hood. He is black, his large, watery eyes stare up in awe at Silus. He grabs Silus' hand which now relaxes and draws Silus' ring to his lips, kissing it, in tears. \nPARISHONER Forgive me. I've offended you... \nWe see Silus' dark stare. \nA beat. \nThen Silus reaches out and places his hand on the man's head. \nSILUS No. You are divine. It is the world that offends me. \nSilus rises, the Parishioner just lays there in awe. Silus now turns to Lilly who is on his shoulder. And now Lilly realizes for the first time that it is Silus. \nLILLY Brother Silus. What's going on? \nWe then hear a police siren and a car pulls up through the rain. The door opens and Jones emerges, taking in both Lilly and Silus. A grim smile of realization comes to Jones' face. He pulls something from his jacket. \nCut to \n81 INT: LILLY'S APARTMENT, LOUNGE - NIGHT                     81 \nSteph's ID is tossed down on a table. \nJONES (off) A shopkeeper heard yelling. Went to see, found this. One witness. A prostitute. \nJones tosses down a photo. It is Freddy, looking suitably scummy in a police identikit photo. \nJONES (continuing) She identified this lovely citizen. We thought maybe he had a grudge or was crazy. I guess we were wrong. \nSilus stands by the window; lights make patterns on his face. \nSILUS It is Edgar. \nLILLY And now he's got Steph. Why does he want her? \nSILUS She is not what he was after. \nWe see Lilly slowly getting it. \nLILLY Steph was staying with me. She was wearing my coat. It was me he was after. Wasn't it? \nSilus now turns, slowly moves towards her,   coming out of the shadows. Lilly finds it hard to return his   gaze, involuntarily touches her neck where it is   scarred from Edgar's attack. Jones is watching all this   very carefully. \nWe can see Lilly lying on the bed, her skin alabaster in the moonlight that comes through the window blinds. Closer closer until we halt above her. \nCut closer to see Lilly asleep; her hand grips her service revolver which protrudes from under her pillow. \nWe see Silus standing above her, his eyes glisten in the sub light. As he watches, Lilly moves, as if she's having a dream, her hand grips the gun beneath her pillow. \nSilus slowly bends down, close to her. Watching. Then he reaches out, as if to gently wake her, then stops as Lilly stirs. She turns, curling up into the fetal position. Silus is confronted with the old scars from Edgar's attack. \nFor a moment Silus stares at her. Stares. Then very quietly, smoothly, he moves his head down, very close to her arm. He sniffs it, as you would something very delicate, very complex. Then he closes his eyes. \nWe see Lilly, her arm. Silus slowly enters frame, moves his face close to Lilly, moves along her arm as if taking in her scent. Slowly her arm raises, as his face moves up her body to her neck, her hand now embracing Silus' head. Closer as his face is near hers and still with eyes closed her face turns towards him, his dark lips and hers are close. \nCut to \nSilus, back where he was, smelling her arm. His eyes open and he moves back a little, as if shocked by the daydream he has just indulged in. \nWe see Lilly, as she was before, curled up in the fetal position. Then a sound. \nSilus immediately pivots, his gun immediately pointed at the figure who stands silhouetted in the doorway. Jones. \nJONES What are you doing? \nThe camera immediately drops, through the floor of Lilly's apartment to the apartment below to find... \n88 INT: APARTMENT BELOW LILLY'S - CONTINUING                   88 \n...Edgar, standing in the apartment below, immediately freezing. We zoom into his ear as he listens. \nFlash cuts of sound and image; a large man turning in his bed and groaning, a tap drips in an apartment, a fluorescent colored mosquito catcher vaporizing a mosquito with a zing, then a woman's lips; whispering... \nLILLY What is it? Jones? \nCut to \n89 INT: LILLY'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - CONTINUING                89 \nSilus above Lilly, his hand up to silence her, Jones stock still in the doorway. Waiting, waiting... \nBang, Silus rushes to the window of the apartment, ripping it open, pointing his gun below. But there is no one there. Then Silus spots it. On the floor below the window is open, a curtain gently wafts out of the window in the breeze. Silus turns to Jones and Lilly. \nSILUS Stay here. \nSilus immediately drops out of the window. \nCut to \nLilly rushes to the window and looks out expecting to see Silus dead on the pavement below, but the street is empty. And then she sees it; the window below her apartment is open. \n90 INT: LILLY'S APARTMENT, HALLWAY - CONTINUING                90 \nLilly, gun extended, moving forward towards her apartment door, Jones behind her, trying to grab her. \nJONES Get back here, Lilly! \nBut Lilly shoves him off, opens the door and moves into the hall and waits. \nShe hears more smashing from the other side of the building. She turns to Jones. \nLILLY Cover me. \nAnd she's off, smashing the apartment door in front of her with her foot and moving into the apartment, towards the window beyond. Jones can only curse, lift his gun and move after her. \n91 INT: APARTMENT ADJACENT TO LILLY'S - CONTINUING             91 \nLilly's POV crashing through the apartment and reaching the window, pulling it open to see... \n92 EXT: LILLY'S APARTMENT, REAR - CONTINUING                   92 \n...Lilly's POV of the city below. We see her search with her eyes, and then she sees it. \nCut to \nEDGAR (continuing) Has he tasted you yet, little policewoman? \nLilly tries to twist out of his grasp. \nEDGAR (continuing) He's just the same as me, you know it, you can feel it too. \nLILLY He's nothing like you. \nEdgar's face twists into a smile. \nEDGAR We will see. You will be my tool. \nJUMP CUT: \nA cat, hissing, screeching. \nCut to Silus and Jones entering the alleyway, the cat tearing away from them in fright. Jones moves forward and we tilt down to see Lilly's gun lying on the wet cobblestones, smoke wisping from the barrel. Jones stoops down and picks up the gun, then turns to Silus. After a beat, Jones throws the gun at Silus' head. Silus dodges it easily and it clacks onto the cobblestones. \nJONES You happy now? \nCut to \n93 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT, TOILET - DAY               93 \nClose on Freddy's face, looking at himself in a mirror. He's pulling back his eyelid; his eyes are bloodshot and he's sweating. Freddy then pushes the mirror shut and we see Edgar, silhouetted in the bathroom doorway. \nFREDDY You scared the shit out of me. Hey, the police woman. She's real sick. To tell the truth I don't feel so hot myself. \nEdgar approaches, still silhouetted. \nEDGAR I want you to take her and put her where they'll find her. \nFREDDY But I'm sick. She's given me something... \nEdgar moves incredibly fast, we can't quite see what he has done but we suspect he has just buried his hand in Freddy's chest. We see Freddy's face, stunned, deathly white. \nEDGAR What have I said to you? \nFreddy falls, leaving Edgar's hand in mid air; we can't see clearly, but it likes frighteningly like he has one of Freddy's internal organs in his hand. \nEDGAR (continuing) I hate arguments. \nCut to \n94 EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, ALLEYWAY - DAY                         94 \nClose on a pendant; the symbol of the Brothers. \nWe pull out to reveal Steph, very sick now. Edgar is has her wrapped in a sheet and is half carrying her along a decrepit alley. Ahead of him is a street; we can see several passersby. \nEdgar sits Steph up against the wall of the alley, propped up. She really is sick. She coughs. \nEdgar looks at her for a moment. Then after consideration, takes her hands and crosses them, and places an envelope in her limp hands. Happy with the composition he moves off. \nCut to \nA close High Angle on Steph looking up, her bloodshot, dazed eyes staring blankly. We drift up and away from her. Already the rats are beginning to come out and sniff her. \n95 INT: HOSPITAL, HALLWAY - DAY                                95 \nThere are several nurses running towards us, they turn and move down a hallway. We reveal Jones and Dominic. They move to the nurses station and Jones flashes his ID. \nJONES Stephanie Richards, you just brought her in. \nAnd then a scream. Blood curdling; the sound of someone insane, screaming their lungs out, hurling abuse. We see the faces of the cops and the terrified nurse in front of them who points down the hall where the noise is coming from. The Cops move off. The nurse then sees someone else arrive. She raises the pendant that hangs around her neck and kisses it. \nNURSE Thank god you're here. \nWe see who has entered. It is Silus. Near him there are several people sick. They look sick; like Steph and Freddy looked. \nCut to \nAnd we see Lilly. She is covered in grime, her hands bound above her head with chains to an ancient, ornate pipes that twist through the place. She looks up at us. \nCut to \n103B INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT, CELL - CONTINUING             103B \nEdgar, now standing above Lilly. He bends down, checking the chains that bind her. His face moves close to her so that he can smell her. Hear her heart pounding. See the scars from his previous attack. Then a noise, echoing through the tunnels. The sound of the mad infected denizens of the containment zone, screaming out into the night. Edgar smiles. \nEDGAR It almost sounds like children playing, don't you think? \nLILLY No. \nEDGAR I looked at your body. You have borne a child. \nLilly's features tense. \nEDGAR (continuing) Did you abandon it? Your kind are good at that. \nEven though her position is impossible, Lilly won't show Edgar fear. \nLILLY Why don't you just kill me? \nEdgar just smiles. Lilly spits in his face and screams at him. \nLILLY (continuing) Kill me! \nEdgar grabs her by the throat, for a moment anger boils out of Edgar, but he restrains himself. \nEDGAR I can see why he likes you. But I have a better use for you. To save you, Silus will take my blood. Join me. \nLILLY You're insane. \nEDGAR The world is insane. I am better than you. But they force me to serve you. Does that happen in a sane world? Forced to watch you waste the most precious thing you have. Life. \nThen Edgar's face changes; he stares at her with pity, for a moment we see a hint of the noble creature he used to be. \nEDGAR (continuing) Do you know what they do to us when we are born? They take us from our mothers. Force us into a life of loneliness, and denial. Can you imagine a life like that? \nLilly senses an opening. \nLILLY You don't have to do this. You can change things. \nEdgar places his head in his hands, he seems to be weeping. \nEDGAR You have reminded me of something. \nWhen he looks back up at her, he is terrifying to behold. \nEDGAR (continuing) I must search out my mother, if she still lives. And kill her for what she did. \nEdgar smiles quietly, rises and exits. \nWe are left with Lilly bound to the rusty pipes. She strains, tries to pull her hands from the chains, but they won't move. Above her on the pipe there is a old rusty bracket. Lilly blinks through the sweat running into her eyes. She moves the \nchains that bind her hands closer to the bracket and begins rubbing the chains against the bracket in the vain hope that she may be able to cut her way through the chains. She strains harder and harder, fighting back the tears, the fear, she just grinds at the chain repetitively. \nCut to \n104 INT: HOSPITAL, STEPH'S ROOM - DAY                           104 \nSteph, in the hospital bed, her eyes staring up, hollow. A bed sheet is drawn over her dead face. \nCut to \n105 INT: HOSPITAL, VARIOUS - CONTINUING                         105 \nWe see Silus. Staring through a window into an office. In there we can see Jones. Jones is talking in a very animated manner to someone who is obviously a reporter. The reporter stares, like Jones, through the window towards Silus. Jones turns away, looking guilty. \nCut to \nBedlam in the hospital corridors. People screaming, being restrained. What is clear is that the virus Steph had has now broken out into a plague of biblical proportions. We see a DOCTOR standing in the middle of the hospital corridor, blood over his smock, in a state of pure shock. \nAUGUSTUS It is a necessary step. We cannot let this escape. \nSILUS No! \nAugustus looks up at Silus; this is perhaps the first time Silus has refused anything that Augustus has decreed. \nAUGUSTUS Is it the policewoman? Is this affecting your thinking? There is no love for our kind Silus. Only service. \nSILUS We have done this. Released this thing into the world. We have betrayed their trust in us, more than once. I won't do it again. \nAUGUSTUS There is no debate. They will be sacrificed, so the rest will be pure. \nSilus shakes his head. \nAUGUSTUS (continuing) This policeman, Jones. He talked to the press. Told them this came from Edgar. \nSilus watches Augustus very carefully. \nAUGUSTUS (continuing) There are members of the inner circle who question the way you have handled this. Blame you for this man's actions. I have made it clear that you will fix this. That you will silence him. \nAugustus moves close to Silus now. Gently touches his face. \nAUGUSTUS (continuing) These are hard things we do. But you must think of the greater good. And of your own future. \nCut to \nA light bulb flickering. \n112 INT: JONES APARTMENT, HALL - NIGHT                         112 \nJones exits an elevator. The light above him flickers and dies. He stands in the dark. \nJONES Great. \nJones begins to stomp down the hall, towards the part of the hall that is lit. Then pop, that light goes out as well. \nJones stops. He pulls out his big gun from his armpit holster. He checks over his shoulder, and then with the gun extended he moves slowly forward. He approaches an area that opens up a little. He pauses, then under his breath. \nJONES (continuing) Come on then... \nHe launches himself around the corner and fires his gun. He's lucky that his misses his target. \nA small, dirty, cowering boy with his fingers on the bank of light switches. The wall next to the boy's head has exploded; dust and wall board now drift down like snow. \nJones can only stare at the quivering child whose dirty face blank with fright. \nThen Jones turns. He can make out a figure in the dark hall. A patient, quiet sentinel. \n113 INT: JONES APARTMENT - NIGHT                                113 \nJones opens the door to his apartment and enters. Silus follows. The place is a dump. Lounge and kitchen all one area, bedroom off to one side, dishes in the sink, clothes everywhere. Jones heads into the kitchen and turns on a coffee machine, then grabs a dirty glass, pours a drink. Silus watches him. \nJones comes into the lounge. He still has his gun in his hand. He stares at Silus, whose perfect outline makes Jones' life seem even more abysmal. \nJONES What do you want? \nSILUS I want to help you. They know you talked to the press. \nJONES They can fuck off. For that matter, so can you. \nJones takes a slurp on his drink. \nJONES (continuing) You'd be the last person I'd trust. \nSILUS Why? \nJONES I saw you. Remember. Watching Lilly, when she was asleep. \nSilus doesn't answer now. Jones moves forward. \nJONES (continuing) Maybe you're just like your Brother. Maybe you're helping him. Now there's a thought. \n116 EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, QUARANTINE ZONE - NIGHT             116 \nCut to a crane down to reveal Silus and Jones observing the guards at the blockade. \nJONES You'll never get in, they've circled the whole borough. \nSilus turns to Jones. \nSILUS I will get in. You must go to the press. Tell them about the water. Tell them what the government will do. \nJONES You're dead after this. You know that? Whatever happens. \nSilus smiles. \nSILUS Watch for me, Officer Jones. \nSilus exits. Jones watches him leave, then Jones leaves too. \n117 EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, QUARANTINE ZONE - CONTINUOUS         117 \nWe see Silus, close. It's as if he is meditating. We pull out to reveal he is kneeling on the roof of a building; he looks as if he's preparing himself for something. \nHe then rises, all fluid concentration, and runs towards us and then the camera is on his shoulder as he jumps off the roof. \nCut to \nSilus' POV falling down down, falling towards a window then smashing through it. \n117A EXT: OMITTED - CONTINUING                                117A \n118 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, QUARANTINE ZONE - CONTINUOUS     118 \nSilus exploding onto the floor of the apartment. For a moment there is silence, just glass tinkling, Silus poised. Then Silus turns and is gone. \nCut to \n119 EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, QUARANTINE ZONE - CONTINUOUS         119 \nThe slums are wrapped in smoke and haze from fires that burn there; an eerie dead zone, made all the stranger by the gothic spires that climb out of the haze. \nThen Silus hears something. It is the wailing of a new born child. Silus moves towards the cries, then up ahead he sees a figure, kneeling on the ground. As Silus moves through the haze he sees what it is. It is a Brother Priest, kneeling beside someone. The Brother is holding the hand of the person on the ground who is in the last throws of death. When Silus is next to him the Priest looks up at him. Tears wet his cheeks. For a moment they just stare at each other. \nPRIEST 2 Who has done this, Brother? \nSILUS We have. To our shame. \nThe Silus hears the babies cries again. Closer now. The Priest stares at the dying creature on the ground in front of him. Drops the limp hand he was holding. Then rises and turns squarely to Silus. \nPRIEST 2 I have something to show you. \nThe Priest moves off towards a building and Silus follows. \nCut to \n119A INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, QUARANTINE ZONE, HOVEL - CONTINUING    119A \nWe see Silus and the Priest enter. The Priest leads Silus into the dark place. As he moves forward Silus can hear a strange gurgling sound; not of the sick or dying, this is a more innocent sound. The sounds of a newborn. \nWe See Silus approach a filthy, roughly made crib. In it is a baby; it's eyes stare up at Silus with wisdom beyond their years. \nPRIEST 2 It is a miracle my Brother. She is a female, the first of our kind. \nSilus watches the baby carefully. \nSILUS She must be protected. \nHe then turns to the Priest. \nSILUS (continuing) I would ask for your help Brother. The Church can no longer be trusted... \n119B EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT - CONTINUING                   119B \nEDGAR It is a maze down here. But given time, that thing will find her. Do things to her. I'll show you where she is, if you take some. \nEdgar stalks forward. He holds up his arm to Silus. \nSilus stares at the tube coming from Edgar's arm. Edgar moves towards Silus, twisting on the tube so that his infected blood drips onto the ground. \nEDGAR (continuing) You're almost there anyway. \nAnd then Silus' face, intense, a dark smile, his hand now gripping Edgar's hand; surprise in Edgar's eyes. \nHe pulls Edgar toward him with all his might, his hand clamping onto Edgar's throat - the power of the entwined bodies immense - then Edgar whipping his body, breaking Silus' grip, smashing Silus on the side of the head, but then only to get a kick from Silus directly in the stomach that sends him smashing into several protruding pipes, ripping into his back. Edgar screams. \n122 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT, CELL - CONTINUING          122 \nLilly. Half conscious now, hanging from the pipe above her, twisting. The sound of Edgar's screams makes her groan, awaken a little, dazed. Then there is a loud clang. She cranes her head to see down the tunnel that leads to her cell. She catches sight of a shadow, movement in the tunnel. \nLILLY Silus... \nThen the figure moves into the tunnel, shuffling, the legs not completely following the brains instructions, but doing enough to propel the person forward, then a stumble. And in a shaft of light Lilly can see a hand slapping at the wet wall. But it is less a hand than a claw. And the face that follows the hand; the red, reflective eyes of one of the half mad, the infected. The thing catches sight of Lilly, then propels itself towards her. \nWe see it's POV, approaching faster, faster. \nAnd Lilly reaching out with her foot, to the door, struggling to hook it with her foot, trying to close it, almost catching the door handle, but her foot is so slippery and the thing is almost on her. Then she stretches out with her foot, just catching the door and slams it in the face of the thing that is about to attack her. \nThe thing on the other side of the door is now screaming wildly and the door handle is jerking down as the creature tries to activate it and Lilly has her feet on it, trying desperately to keep the door shut, but her feet keep slipping. And then she realizes that the pipe from which she hangs is beginning to wobble - water is now coursing from the hole in the wall, beginning to flow faster and faster. Her feet slip more and more on the door. \nLilly tries to keep the door closed, but her feet are too slippery and the thing is pushing through the door. In the dark space only its eyes and slavering mouth are clear, hands grasping for Lilly legs, scratching at them, Lilly twisting, the creature's nails searching for purchase on her legs. Lilly hauls herself up, wrapping her legs around the pipe she's attached to. The thing below her is groaning incoherently, reaching up, its hands grabbing at her, Lilly pulling herself just out of reach, then seeing the eyes below her, wanting her. Lilly tries to pull herself higher. And then she feels it. The pipe she's attached to is shifting, where it joins the wall. Water is now flooding from it, the pipe jerks down, some of the old wall giving way. \nThe creature's fingers are now able to grasp Lilly's t-shirt, drag at it, pull at her, screaming, the pipe grinding, water flowing and then the whole thing comes down, the pipe bursting out of the wall. \nLilly and the pipe falls, right on top of the creature. \nFor a moment neither of them move, then the creature is grabbing at Lilly's hair, pulling her head back. In a flash Lilly pulls the pipe to which she is attached right into the face of the creature. This gives her time to stagger upright. \nShe's still chained around the pipe; she can see the end of the pipe near the door. \nShe begins to slide the chains back as the creature begins to rise and advance towards her. Lilly desperately slides the chain along the pipe. It catches on a protrusion, while the creature advances. Lilly frees it just in time, falling backwards as the creature jumps at her, Lilly lifting the chain up to hold the creature back. The creature strains to get at Lilly. Lilly now has the chain at the creature's neck. She begins to tighten it around the creature's neck, her only hope now. The creature changes now, from frightening to pitiful as it realizes it can't breath, it's fingers desperately moving over Lilly's face, almost pleading. Tears form in Lilly's eyes as she tightens the stranglehold; there is no anger there, just desperation, and behind that, pity. \nThe creature breathes it's last breath then collapses onto Lilly. \n123 OMITTED                                                      123 AND                                                              AND \n124A INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT, STEAMROOM - CONTINUING        124A \nEdgar and Silus stalk each other in the steam room. Edgar launches himself towards Silus, but Silus is now too quick. Silus slams Edgar sideways into a pipe, an imprint of Edgar's face left on the pipe. \nStunned Edgar releases his grip, stumbles back, Silus rising now, he has him. Again, Silus slams Edgar's head into another pipe. And now Silus has Edgar's throat in his fist and the look on Silus' face tells Edgar he will not escape. \nWe see Edgar, beginning to lose consciousness now, dying. Steam now rises all around them from broken pipes. Then behind Silus, Edgar can make something out. An old, corroded tank, steaming, with the words sterilizer on it. There are a series of long shafts connected to the sterilizer via a tube and held in position by clamps; they look like they're for sterilizing bottles. \nWith a last effort Edgar propels Silus backwards onto one of the shafts, making Silus grimace and clutch his back where he's been pierced, then slide to the ground. The piercing has operated some lever so that steam now also drifts from the wound on Silus' back. \nCut to \nSilus looking up, clutching his back with the pain of it. \nAnd now Edgar above him. He removes one of the sterilizer shafts from the bracket that holds it. He clutches a lever on the side which makes viciously hot steam pulse from the end of the shaft. Edgar moves slowly towards Silus. \nWe see Silus, unable to rise, crawling back, until bang, he's stopped by more pipes behind him. Nowhere to go. \nAnd Edgar ready to pounce. He does, driving the shaft towards Silus' head. Silus manages to raise one hand to Edgar's wrist to stop the shaft from piercing his skull. Now the shaft is right in Silus' face, the lightly steaming hole staring back at Silus. Edgar's finger moves to the lever on the side of the shaft, ready to get some steam going. \nEDGAR If I burn the skin from your face, I wonder how that would be. If you looked like a monster... \nCut to \nEdgar's finger moving over the steaming lever. The steaming end of the shaft right in Silus' face. \nThen Edgar's face as he watches his brothers face for the last time. \nThe blasting sound of steam and a steaming blast from the shaft drifts into our frame. \n", "test1_input": "JONES (continuing) There's a kid who saw it, down there. \nLilly sees the red shirted street urchin in the distance being talked to by two uniformed policemen. \nJONES (continuing) Says it was a Brother. And they've got another fellow, that's all who saw it. \nLilly nods. \nLILLY Alright, we'll close this down gents. None of you are to say a word, not even to your old mother. \nAll the police officers stare at her; they know what she means alright. \nLILLY (continuing) Jones. Make sure. \nJones shrugs and nods. Lilly gets up and moves towards the street kid who is being talked to by two burly, grumpy policemen. The boy is shaking. \nLILLY (continuing) He saw what happened? \nPOLICEMAN 1 Now he wont talk. Didn't see anything. \nLilly looks at the boy. So young. \nLILLY What's your name? \nThe kid doesn't answer and gets a whack around the ears from one of the policemen. \nLILLY (continuing; to the policeman) Stop that. \nLilly stares at the kid, as if the way he looks has keyed a memory in her. She squats and looks him straight in the eye. \nLILLY (continuing) What's your name then? \nKID (nervous) Albert. \nLILLY You live around here? \nThe kid looks nervous. Lilly moves some of the bedraggled hair out of the kid's eyes. \nLILLY (continuing) I grew up 3 streets from here. Matheson Lane. The Skrummers Workhouse. \nKID (surprised) You did? \nLILLY Or should I say, I crawled out of here. \nThe kid smiles. Lilly focuses on him now. \nLILLY (continuing) No one else will do anything about this, you know? They just think this is a slum. No one really cares what happens to the people here. Except for you. And me. \nThe kid stares at her; she's a magician and he's a believer. \nLILLY (continuing) What did you see? \nKID A man. \nLILLY What kind of man? \nKID A Brother. \nLILLY You're sure it was a Brother? \nKID He had teeth and everything. \nLILLY Where did he go? \nThe kid turns and points to the shear wall of the alley. \nKID He went straight up there. \nLilly stares at the wall. \nLILLY Alright, you go with these men, they'll look after you. I promise. \n", "test1_true": "LILLY (continuing; to the Policemen) Get him to describe it all. And keep him away from everyone. \nThe Policemen grunt and begin to lead the kid off. \nLILLY (continuing; to the Policemen) And get him some food. \nJones, now standing next to Lilly, moans. \nJONES Now they'll all want feeding. \nLilly looks at Jones's callous face; she's not amused. \nCut to \n27 EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, BUILDING ABOVE ALLEYWAY - CONTINUING   27 \nHigh angle POV of Lilly and Jones moving off. Someone is watching them from the roof above. The POV belongs to Silus, who stares down at them. In particular he watches Lilly. We see Lilly pause and then look up as if feeling she's watched. \nWe see Lilly's POV of the building above. There is no one there. \nHA of Lilly looking up. \nCut to \n28 INT: POLICE STATION, HOWARD ANDERSON'S OFFICE - LATER      28 \nA device flies toward the camera, sharp needles eject from it slamming into skin. \nSeated at the desk is a harassed, balding man (ANDERSON)of about 55. He's just finished vaccinating himself, wincing at the needle jabs on the soft skin of his arm. There are many other needle marks on his skin. \nLILLY (off) I've quarantined the neighborhood. \nLilly stands before the man's large desk, which is lit by only a desk lamp. \nLILLY (continuing) As far as anyone knows we have a new influenza outbreak. \nANDERSON What about the telephonic companies? \nLILLY They're cooperating, closing all phone lines in and out except directly to us. \nAnderson nods. \nANDERSON Sit, sit. \nShe does. \nANDERSON (continuing) You've done well Lilly. The reporter is more of a problem. We have 2 days by law before we have to release her. Then it's out. \nAnderson lays down the medi kit and stares at it as he motions for her to sit. She does. \nANDERSON (continuing) I hate these things. I'm like a pin cushion. \nLILLY It's better than the alternative, sir. \nAnderson stares at her; a moment of tension. \nANDERSON I need you to stay with this, Lilly. You know Jamestown better than anyone, how to handle the people. \nLilly acknowledges the compliment. \nANDERSON (continuing) The Brothers have requested to be involved with the investigation. \nLILLY That's nice for them. \nANDERSON You have a problem with it? \nLILLY Not particularly. \nANDERSON Good. I think they can help. And I don't want someone working on this whose got something against the Church. \n", "test1_id": 432, "test2_input": "LILLY How do you know I don't? \nANDERSON Lilly, you're the least prejudiced person I know. In fact, you're the only one I know. That's important. The church is powerful, but more than that, people's faith in the Brotherhood is about all they've got these days. And the government knows it. Even the Queen herself is involved. This is political. \nCut to \n29 INT: POLICE STATION, COMMUNAL OFFICE - DAY               29 \nLilly enters, drinking a coffee. She begins to top it up from the coffee stand when Jones comes up to her. \nJONES Lil'. He's here. \nLilly's expression becomes taut. She peers towards her office. She can clearly see an exceptionally well dressed man in her office with his back to us. It is Silus. A young female cop - Steph - is in there and we can see her kissing a ring on Silus' hand and Silus placing his hand on her head as if blessing her. \nSteph then exits the office and approaches Lilly and Jones; her face is flushed with excitement. \nSTEPH Do you know who he is? That's Brother Silus. They say one day he will lead the Brotherhood. He's a great man. \nJONES I think I hear choir music. \nSteph flashes Jones a resentful look. \nSTEPH Do you respect anything? \nJONES Hey. My old mum goes to church four times a week and gives blood. She's happy as a lark. Just don't expect me to kiss him, that's all I'm telling you. \nCut to \n30 INT: POLICE STATION, LILLY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS            30 \nClose on the enigmatic ring on Silus' finger. \nWe see Lilly is seated on one side of her desk, Silus on the other. Lilly is staring at the ring, then she studies a Photostat in front of her. There is a picture of a man, a rather perfect looking man. \nLILLY Senior Brother Edgar... How long have you known about this? \nSilus opposite Lilly, his perfect, serene appearance an anathema in the grunge of the Jamestown police station. He watches her very carefully, listens to the way her finger taps the sheet in front of her, the sound of her chair swiveling, all the sounds very acute to him; she has a physical ease about her. \nSILUS A matter of weeks. \nLilly smiles. \nSILUS (continuing) Is there something wrong? \nLilly stops smiling. For the first time she is still. \nLILLY Yes. Withholding evidence. Covering up two murders. And no one's worried. If me or one of the people in Jamestown did that they'd be in the hell house with the key thrown away. It seems the church is able to do whatever it wants. \nSilus nods. \nSILUS You're right to not like it. It is political. \nLilly becomes more interested at this; at the bald honesty of the statement. \nSILUS (continuing) We thought we could find Brother Edgar ourselves. We were wrong. But now any debate is pointless. \nLilly stares at him. There is already something between them even though they stand on opposite sides of a huge gulf. She nods, accepting his point. \nSILUS (continuing) The greatest danger is if this were to become public knowledge. \nLILLY Wouldn't want anyone criticizing the church I suppose. \nSILUS It's more than that Captain. This is about prejudice, or rather the nature of it. As a female surely you would understand. \nLILLY Really. \nSILUS How many other Captains in this borough are female? \nLILLY None? \nSILUS How are your actions judged, the same or differently from the men. \n", "test2_true": "LILLY Differently. \nSILUS Exactly. If a white man kills, then he is just a killer. If a black man kills, then all black men are suspect. That is the nature of prejudice. Those who are different are grouped together. If only one Brother does a bad thing then all Brothers are suspect, because we are different. And then what would this world be like, if there was no hope? \nLilly nods, acknowledging the truth of it. \nLILLY Alright then. So what do you suggest? \nSILUS First, there is something you should hear. \nCut to \n31 INT: POLICE STATION, BRIEFING ROOM - LATER               31 \nScummy, large briefing room. There are seven cops in here, perched on desks and chairs. Jones, Dominic, Frank plus four others. Lilly is also there. So is Silus, sitting, perfectly still, calm. Several of the cops look at him suspiciously. \nLILLY Ok, ok, quiet down. \nEveryone nods and shuts up as Lilly stands in front of the men. \nLILLY (continuing) Gentlemen, there's no other way to put it. We have only 2 days to find the suspect. \nThere are guffaws from most of the policemen. \nJONES There's no chance. Not a hope in hell. \nFRANK He's right. We don't even know where to begin. \nLILLY Quiet! \nLilly is angry. There is silence in the room. Lilly seems more angry than she should be. \nLILLY (continuing) What you are about to hear will not leave this room. Everyone understand? Jones? \nJones shrugs. \nLILLY (continuing) I would suggest anyone with a weak stomach leave now. \nNo one moves. They all stare at Lilly. \nLILLY (continuing) This is Brother Silus. \nShe motions to Silus, who rises, watching the glares from the cops who eye him like a suspect. \nSILUS Thank you Captain. Could we have the plate? \nAn old slide projector heats up as the main lights are turned off. The projector sprays an image up on the wall. The face of a killer, before he became one, the serene gaze of a Brother. \nSILUS (continuing) Senior Brother Edgar. Until 3 weeks ago, he was a trusted and talented theologian and scientist. \nDOMINIC What'd he do? \nSILUS He was personally responsible for developing the most recent influenza antivirals. It is because of him that most of you are alive today. His behavior appeared normal. Next. \n3 photos come up. The victims. \nSILUS (continuing) The victims. John Anderson. Julie Danes. Tanya Garfield. All in their early 20's, but beyond that no obvious connection. Next. \nA Map. \nSILUS (continuing) There is no precedent for Brother Edgar's behavior. No Brother has ever taken a human life, not in the 300 years since we began. Not one. Our role has been to preserve and maintain the human life. Not take it. \nJONES Next he'll be wanting an fucking medal. \nSilus stares directly at Jones now. Their eyes lock. Silus continues, perfectly calm. \nSILUS What I am saying to you is that Brother Edgar's behavior is aberrant. We \nSILUS (cont) don't understand it. And therefore it's difficult to predict. The only thing we know is where he will strike next. \n", "test2_id": 433, "test3_input": "DOMINIC How do you know? \nSilus moves to the desk next to him. He passes something to another cop who now sits at the desk. We see Lilly now. The look on her face tells us that she knows what is coming and she's not looking forward to it. \nWe see what Silus gave the cop. An audio tape. The cop places the tape in a tape deck. He then switches it on. He then turns the volume knob on an amplifier which now directs static hiss to two big speakers. \nWe see the faces of the cops, all listening in the dim light coming from the slide projector. \nAbove the level of the hissing tape there is another noise. It is a wet sound. Like a cat would make if it were lapping up milk. An another sound. Like an animal, moaning with pleasure. \nWe see the cops; some of them are beginning to twig. And there is another noise. It is a man; moaning. \nMAN ON THE TAPE (off) Please. Please don't hurt me. \nWe see Jones and Dominic. Their glares say it all. And then another voice. \nEDGAR (off, like to a lover) Quiet. \nMAN ON THE TAPE (off) Please... \nEDGAR (off) I said shut up! \nThen we hear a punch and then noises which can only be described as sounding like a dog killing something. \nJones springs out of his seat. \nJONES Fuck! \nLILLY Jones, sit down. \nJONES Why are we listening to this?! \nLILLY Quiet! \nJones stands there enraged. Dominic pulls him down back into his chair. All the cops are appalled by what they have heard. And then a voice. \nEDGAR (off) Good. Now you're quiet. \nWe can hear Edgar moving around. \nEDGAR (continuing; off) Did you hear that Silus? I hope so. \nWe see Silus, listening as intently as everyone else. \nEDGAR (continuing; off) The next one will be tomorrow. There is a square, Bridge Square it's called. I will take the next one from there. You should try harder this time. Please try harder... \nMore moving around, then the sound on the tape cuts out. We are left with only tape hiss. Everyone stares at Silus. \nFRANK He sent this to you. Specifically. \nSILUS We share the same mother. There is a bond. \nThe cops all stare at Silus' emotionless response. \nLILLY There will be two teams. Frank, I want you and Abernathy up in the buildings around Bridge Square. \nFrank nods. \nLILLY (continuing) I'll lead the other team with Dominic, Jones and Queen's Imperial Guard in support. No guns, batons only. \nJONES What? \nLILLY You heard me. He's to be taken alive. \n32 EXT: JAMESTOWN, BRIDGE SQUARE - NIGHT                      32 \nIt has rained. The small square is dimly lit. At it's center is a small park with distorted trees. And a rundown playground. A rusty swing creaks. We see a figure there. It is Lilly. She watches the rusty swing creak. Then she looks up to the surrounding buildings. \nWe tilt up to one of the buildings which is perhaps eight stories high; like the others around the square it is an apartment building. There is movement at the very top. \nCut to \n", "test3_true": "POV from the top of the building, observing Lilly below enter a black, unmarked van. Then there is buzz from an RT. We reveal POV belongs to Silus. \nSILUS Yes. \n34 INT: POLICE VAN - NIGHT                                    34 \nLilly is in a police van. Jones and Dominic are there with her; both of them trying to come to grips with the strange stun weapons they've been given. And there are three huge, dark eyed soldiers there, dressed in the ominous black uniform of the Queen's Imperial Guard, cocking their electric batons; which fizz in the half light. \nLILLY Anything? \nWe cut between Lilly in the van and Silus on the roof. \nSILUS No. \nSilus surveys the scene. He can see an Imperial Guard sniper over the square on the roof of a building. Below, in the street, we can see the silhouettes of several Brothers; unmoving, watchful sentinels. \nLILLY It's getting late. \nSILUS He will come. \nLILLY Ok. We'll sit tight. \nLilly closes the com. Jones is staring at her. \nJONES This is a dud. \nLilly ignores Jones and talks into the RT again. \nLILLY Frank? \nCut to \n35 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, BRIDGE SQUARE - NIGHT           35 \nFrank is inspecting a stairwell of the building. He has Abernathy with him. He talks into his RT. \nFRANK Yeah Lil'. \nLILLY (off) Anything? \nFRANK Not a thing. \nLILLY (off) Check each floor again. \nFrank motions to Abernathy, who is already sighing. \nFRANK You heard her. Once more for the empire. \nLow Angle from the floor of the two men beginning to climb the stairs, their guns out. \nThe shot stays where it is. We can see the stairs and the wall. We pause. The soundtrack is almost dead quiet, apart from the buzzing flouro above us. And then the CAMERA begins to advance, like a POV, heading for the wall ahead. It reaches the corner and then advances along cables running up to the roof. As it climbs we can see a ventilation shaft in the corner with no grill. The camera approaches it and moves into the shaft, continuous. \n36 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, VENTILATION SHAFT - CONTINUOUS     36 \nThe shot continues to track through the man-sized shaft. As we move through the shaft - turning corners, going up floors - we pass grills. Some of them show light coming from the apartments within. We can hear an argument in one room. A crying child in the next. A TV blaring in another (playing porno). But mostly the rooms are dark. And as we move up and along, there is a scuttling NOISE, growing louder, as if we are approaching it. \nThen the NOISE stops. \nThe camera halts, stares down the long ventilation shaft. Silence. Dead silence. The camera starts to move again and then turns a corner to run into the leering face of Edgar, the vampire, his teeth bared, his eyes reflecting in the half light. Then he smiles. \nEDGAR Shoo. \nCut to \nA rat, staring back at Edgar. The rat turns and streaks off back whence it came. \nA slight smile appears on Edgar's face; a smile that can chill the blood in your veins. \nThen he begins to move forward. We hear his breathing; low, but excited. He moves with the precision and strength of an insect. His eyes glisten and reflect light like an animal's. His skin is flesh white and milky in the metal shaft. \n", "test3_id": 434}

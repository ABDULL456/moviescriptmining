MARK I've got the space. It can be expensive though, a nice futon. I mean, how much do you think a good one would cost? 
CHERYL Mark, just take a deep breath, then let go. 
MARK Do I seem anxious? 
CHERYL You do a little. Cheryl lies down beside him. 
CHERYL (CONT'D) Laura told me you were a poet. What's it like to be a poet? 
MARK It's a way of living inside your own head, which is where I spend most of my time. 
CHERYL But not today. By the way, I like your shirt. 
He smiles, genuinely flattered. 
MARK Thank you. 
CHERYL So I need to ask you some basic questions. Okay? 
MARK Sure. 
CHERYL What is the iron lung for? 
MARK It keeps me breathing. I can spend a few hours outside of it, with my portable respirator, depending on how I feel. But I work and sleep in the iron lung. 34A. 
CHERYL How do you feel right now? 
MARK Out of my league. 
CHERYL I meant your breathing. MARK Oh...fine. In fact, better than usual. 
CHERYL That's great. Do you have any areas of unusual sensitivity? Any parts of your body you don't want me to touch? 
MARK I have normal sensitivity all over. It's just that my muscles don't work. You can touch me anywhere. 
CHERYL Shall we get undressed then? 
Mark is taken by surprise by the suddenness of it. He hesitates momentarily. 
MARK Sure. 
Cheryl starts to unbutton his shirt. Mark's terror is visible in his eyes and she can also feel his heart palpitating. She starts to slowly extract one of Mark's arms from his shirt- sleeve. Suddenly, he lets out a piercing scream. 
MARK (CONT'D) Ow! Ow! Stop! It hurts! 
She recoils, shocked. 
CHERYL What's wrong? 
MARK Holy Mother of God! 
CHERYL Tell me what's wrong. 
MARK My fingers! They're caught! 
She discovers that his fingers have been snagged in the fabric of the shirt and his fingers are being bent backward.

{"train": "RENEE (she looks up) Huh?... oh, yeah, it is. \nFRED Same one you were reading the other night? \nRENEE What night? \nFRED When you didn't come to the club. \nRENEE Oh. Oh, yeah.  No. This is a different one. \nFRED I called, you know. \nRENEE Called?  When? \nFRED From the club.  You didn't answer. \nRENEE I must have fallen asleep.  I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I? \nFRED You were asleep when I got home, yes. \nRenee goes back to her book.  Fred sips his coffee and smokes. \nRENEE (without looking up) I told you you could wake me up if you wanted to. \nRenee looks up at him now, takes off her glasses, and stares at him. \nCLOSE UP OF FRED'S FACE - a disturbed expression. \nRenee seems about to say something more, but stops, puts her glasses back on and resumes reading. \nFADE OUT: \nFADE IN: \nINT. THE MADISON HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nFred is in bed waiting for Renee.  He hears noises from the bathroom - bottles clinking, drawers opening and closing. Renee comes out wearing a robe, which she sheds just before getting into bed.  Naked under the covers, she switches out her bedside lamp.  The only light in the room comes from the outside, through the windows.  Fred moves closer to Renee, puts his lips to her cheek, a hand on her breast.  She does not respond.  Fred pulls Renee to him, and kisses her passionately.  Renee accedes to his demands, but does not participate willingly.  He makes love to her voraciously, but her lack of passion disturbs him.  Fred can't stop, however, and when he comes she acts consolingly, stroking him maternally while he calms down.  He climbs off of her and retreats to his side of the bed. \nCLOSE UP ON FRED'S EYES - which express his horror and humiliation. \nThey lie there in the dark silence for a while. \nFred turns back toward Renee in the darkness. \nFRED I had a dream about you last night... \nRENEE Yeah? \nFRED You were in the house... calling my name... but I couldn't find you. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE MADISON HOUSE - NIGHT \nFRED'S DREAM \nFred is walking slowly across the living room. \nFred's POV: moving - searching. \nFred stops and listens. \nRENEE (tentatively - distant and off screen) Fred?  Fred, where are you? \nThe camera turns slowly back toward the hallway, and as it drifts it RISES UP following along the hall and turning slowly into the bedroom.  Renee is lying below in the bed. \nFRED V.0. Then there you were... lying in bed... but it wasn't you... It looked like you... but it wasn't. \nThe camera suddenly dives violently at Renee - into a TIGHT CLOSE UP.  Her face registers TOTAL FEAR. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  THE MADISON HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nFred is lying in bed with Renee, who is now backlit by her bedside lamp.  Fred looks at her shadowed face, but it's not Renee's face.  It's a face Fred has never seen before.  Fred quickly turns and switches on his bedside lamp, and looks quickly back at Renee, whose face is now her own. \nRENEE Fred, are you all right? \nFred reaches out a hand and tenderly touches her face.  Renee covers his hand with her own, and closes her eyes. \nFADE OUT: \nFADE IN: \nEXT. THE MADISON HOUSE - DAY \nRenee finds another envelope on the doorstep.  She opens it, pulls out a videotape.  A large dog is BARKING incessantly somewhere in the neighborhood.  Renee looks around to see if she can see the dog. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE MADIS0N HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nThe Detectives enter the bedroom.  Fred and Renee follow. \nED This is the bedroom. \nThe Detectives look around without touching anything. \nAL Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you? \nFRED This is our bedroom. \nED There's no other bedroom? \nFRED No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed. \nAL You're a musician? \nFRED Yes, I thought my wife ... \nED What's your axe? \nFRED Tenor... Tenor saxophone.  Do you... \nED (shakes his head) Tone deaf. \nAL (to Renee) Do you own a video camera? \nRENEE No. Fred hates them. \nThe Detectives both look at Fred. \nFRED I like to remember things my own way. \nAL What do you mean by that? \nFRED How I remember them.  Not necessarily the way they happened. \nED Do you have an alarm system? \nRENEE Yes, actually we do... but we haven't been using it. \nAL Why not? \nFRED It kept going off for some reason.  False alarms. \nED Might be a good time to try using it again. \nAL Anybody else have a key to the house. \nRENEE No. \nAL Maid?  Relative? \nRENEE No, one of us is always here to let the maid in.  Nobody else has a key. \nED (to Al) Let's check the doors and windows... See if there's been a break-in. \nThey all leave the bedroom. \nCUT TO: \nINT THE MADISON HOUSE FRONT DOOR - DAY \nEd is checking the door for marks. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  THE MADISON HOUSE    LIVING ROOM - DAY \nFred's POV: He's watching Ed and Al with Renee who are outside the house, walking around the property, checking it out. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  THE MADISON HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY \nEd and Al are standing by an unmarked police car with Fred and Renee.  The Detectives are about to depart. \nAL \nWe'll keep a watch on the house. \nED As best we can. \nAL If anything else happens, you'll call us. Al hands Fred a card.  Ed hands Renee a card. \nRENEE We will. \nFRED Thanks, guys. \nED It's what we do. \nEd and Al get into the car and drive off.  Renee and Fred look at each other, warily, then go back into the house.  THE CAMERA SLOWLY PANS OVER THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE AS IN THE VIDEOTAPE. \nFRED No, not to me. \nAl, Ed and Fred all look at Renee. \nRENEE I...\tno. No. No threats. \nED We'll take the tapes with us, if that's all right with you? \nEd looks at Fred, then Renee, both of whom nod their agreement. \nAL We'll see that the patrol of the house is doubled. \nRENEE I don't know if I want to stay here.  I don't feel safe. \nFRED Where would you feel safe? \nRENEE I don't know. maybe a hotel. \nEd and Al are watching this exchange between Fred and Renee with keen interest. \nThere is a strained silence between them. \nED Did you use the alarm system since we were here last? \nFRED The first night ... Not the last two. \nAL Why not? \nFRED (shrugs) I forgot.  Anyway, I hate the idea of acting paranoid. \nRENEE Acting paranoid?!!! Someone is in our house while we're sleeping, filming us, and you don't want to act paranoid?!!! I thought you set the alarm! \nFred gets up, lights a cigarette, paces. \nFRED I'll make sure the alarm is set from now on. \nRENEE But that doesn't solve the problem.  Who is doing this?  And why? \nEd and Al rise from their chairs.  Ed picks up the envelopes. \nAL We'll find out, Mrs. Madison. \nRenee stands with the Detectives.  Fred stands apart - his expression, pained and bewildered. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ANDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nA swinging party is in progress at Andy's house - the man whose face we saw at the Luna Lounge with Renee.  ANDY, 37 years old, a slick guy, is seen moving through the crowd, making small talk, kissing and being kissed.  The PEOPLE here are wannabe players, the men mostly shady, gold-chain- wearing, slightly unsavory types; the women dressed provocatively, big hair and skin-tight dresses.  Through sliding glass doors we see nude and semi-nude people cavorting in a swimming pool.  Everyone has a drink in his or her hand.  Renee finishes her drinkt and hands the empty glass to Fred who walks away with it.  Andy grabs Renee, and dances with her.  They laugh and talk.  Renee appears to be a bit intoxicated. \nFred, who appears less than thrilled with the carryings on, makes his way to the open bar where he orders two drinks. When the drinks arrive he drains one of them completely, then sets the empty glass down on the bar.  Then he swallows the other drink, too, and sets down the glass. \nA MYSTERY MAN, tall, well-dressed and groomed, older than Fred, approaches him. \nMYSTERY MAN We've met before, haven't we? \nFRED I don't think so.  Where was it that you think we've met? \nMYSTERY MAN At your house.  Don't you remember? \nFRED (surprised) No, no I don't.  Are you sure? \nMYSTERY MAN Of course.  In fact, I'm there right now. \nFRED (incredulous) What do you mean?  You're where right now? \nMYSTERY MAN At your house. \nFRED That's absurd. \nThe Mystery Man reaches into his coat pocket, takes out a cellular phone and holds it out to Fred. \nMYSTERY MAN Call me. \nFred snickers, like this is a bad joke.  The Mystery Man puts the phone into Fred's hand. \nMYSTERY MAN (CON-T) Dial your number. \nFred hesitates, puzzled. \nMYSTERY MAN (CON-T) Go ahead. \nFred shrugs, laughs, dials his number. We HEAR a pick up as we stay on FRED'S FACE. \nPHONE VOICE OF MYSTERY MAN I told you I was here. \nFred, still holding the phone, stares at the man standing in front of him. \nFRED How did you do that? \nThe Mystery Man points to the phone. \nWe see Fred's eyes roll open as he cranes his neck around and upwards, looking at the video camera high on the wall of the courtroom, pointing down on him. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LINGERIE SHOP - DAY \nMARIAN and RAQUEL, two exquisite young women, are looking over the merchandise. \nRAQUEL Did you see that about the guy who chopped up his wife into a million pieces? \nMARIAN How could I miss it?  The TV won't quit with that stuff. \nRAQUEL They're gonna cook him. \nMARIAN Andy's from Utah.  He says there you have a choice... You can die by hanging or by firing squad. \nRAQUEL Which would you choose? \nMarian holds up a black teddy to her body. \nMARIAN Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely. \nRAQUEL Do they aim for the head or for the heart? \nMARIAN The heart, I guess. \nRAQUEL I wouldn't... The brain would know what's going on.  Your heart would be ripped open trying to pump blood, blood pouring into the chest cavity.  Savage pain, Marian. \nRaquel takes a red teddy and holds it up to her chest. \nMARIAN Oh, that's hot... So you'd rather be hung, huh? \nThey both giggle at the obvious joke. \nRAQUEL Absolutely... Soon as your neck snaps, you black out.  It might take a while for the body to die, but you wouldn't feel it. \nMarian reaches for a pair of panties with a hole in the crotch. \nMARIAN You might be right, Raquel. \nMarian sticks a finger through the hole in the panties and wiggles it.  The girls giggle.  Raquel sees Andy walking into the store.  He is sneaking up behind Marian, and motions with a finger to his lips to Raquel not to say anything.  When Andy gets directly behind Marian, he puts his hands over her eyes. \nANDY Guess who? \nCUT TO: \nINT. PRISON - DEATH ROW - DAY \nFred, in the custody of GUARDS, wearing handcuffs and leg irons, is being escorted to his cell.  He appears zombie-like as the guards open the cell door, unlock and remove his shackles, and lock him in. \nGUARD Make yourself to home, fella. \nThe guards leave.  Fred stands near the cell door, begins to look around at the four walls, the single cot, the wash basin, and the toilet bowl without a seat.  He hears the muffled, DISTORTED NOISES - VOICES from the surrounding cells.  Lost voices - the voices of death row.  Fred realizes where he is now.  He walks over to the cot and slowly sinks down and sits on the edge.  Fred perched on the cot in his cell resembles a man adrift on a tiny raft in the middle of an ocean. \nFADE OUT: \nFADE IN: \nINT. PRISON - DEATH ROW - DAY \nA TRUSTEE is pushing a meal cart along the row.  At each door, the Trustee stops and takes a tray off the cart.  He shoves the meal tray through a slot in the door.  We watch him distribute the trays down the long row of cells. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. PRIS0N - DEATH ROW HALLWAY - NIGHT \nThe hallway is quiet - distant sounds reverberate. \nDISSOLVE TO: INT. PRISON - FRED'S CELL - DAY \nFred sits on the edge of his bed, a tray of prison food sits on the floor - uneaten. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. PRISON - FRED'S CELL   NIGHT \nFred lies awake on his cot   he stares at the ceiling. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. PRISON - DEATH ROW HALLWAY - NIGHT \nThe hallway is quiet - distant sounds reverberate. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. PRISON - EXERCISE YARD - DAY \nThis is a small narrow yard, not the large exercise yard for population.  This yard is for use by death row prisoners only, to exercise in one hour each day, by himself.  Fred is released into the area, which is more like a dog run.  The Guards watch Fred as he walks slowly up and down the exercise yard. \nCUT TO: \nGUARD Something wrong? \nFRED My... My head. \nGUARD Headache, huh?  Too much sun, I guess. You want to come in?  Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it. \nFRED No, no.  I want to go in. \nThe guard assists Fred back inside the building. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PRISON - FRED'S CELL - DAY \nFred is on his cot, holding his head.  He is obviously in pain.  He gets up and staggers to the cell door.  Fred pushes a CALL button next to the door to summon a guard.  The GUARD comes and speaks to Fred through a double mesh opening. \nGUARD What's botbering you, Madison? \nFRED The pain is getting worse.  I need more aspirin. \nGUARD I can't give you anymore.  I'll talk to the doctor. \nThe guard leaves. Fred collapses to the floor of the cell, writhing in pain. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PRISON - INFIRMARY   DAY \nFred is brought in wearing handcuffs and leg irons, a GUARD on either arm.  He is placed on a chair in the middle of the room.  The guards stand one on each side of him.  A DOCTOR enters.  He is in late-middle age, with serious eyebrows. Fred's head is hanging down, chin on chest.  The Doctor lifts Fred's head and we see dark circles under Fred's eyes; his face is pale, teeth clenched, eyes tearing.  The Doctor takes a light utensil from his pocket, and inspects each of Fred's eyes.  He feels Fred's forehead.  After this, he allows Fred's head to drop down again.  The Doctor takes Fred's pulse.  He drops Fred's wrist.  He next takes Fred's blood pressure. \nDOCTOR You sleeping okay? \nFRED (strained whisper) I can't sleep. \nThe Doctor goes over to a cabinet, unlocks a drawer, and removes a large blue pill.  He fills a paper cup with water from a dispenser, goes back to Fred and places the pill in Fred's mouth.  The Doctor tilts Fred's head up and pours the water down his throat, some of it dribbling down the front of Fred's shirt.  The Doctor looks into Fred's mouth to make sure he swallowed the pill. \nDOCTOR You'll sleep now. (to Guards) Take him back to his cell. \nThe guards lift Fred by his arms, and shuffle march him out of the infirmary. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PRISON - FRED'S CELL - NIGHT \nFred awakens on his cot.  He turns and sits up in the darkness.  A stream of light through the slot window illumines Fred's head, the forehead of which is swollen and discolored.  He staggers up and shuffles over to the call button, which he leans on.  A few moments later, a GUARD appears on the other side of the mesh. \nGUARD What is it? \nFRED Aspirin... fly head.  I gotta have more aspirin. \nGUARD The doctor said not to give you anything. You can see him in the morning. \nFRED But my head... \nThe guard looks at Fred through the window, and what he sees disturbs him.  The guard makes a strange face. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PRISON - DEATH ROW HALLWAY - NIGHT \nThe guard walks away from Fred's door to the guard station, where another GUARD is sitting at a table, reading a magazine. \nGUARD #1 Shit, that wife killer's lookin' pretty fucked up. \nGUARD #2 (not looking up from his magazine) Which one? \nThey both laugh. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PRIS0N - FRED'S CELL - SAME - NIGHT \nFred is on the floor lying on back. The camera comes slowly down at him from the ceiling, like a weight pressing on his head.  Fred's pain is demonstrably overwhelming him now.  He moans and rolls from side to side in the dimness, making grotesque, otherworldly sounds.  As the camera moves into a CLOSE UP, the last image of Fred's head shows the discolored swelling has increased.  Fred looks up, sensing something. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE MADIS0N HOUSE - NIGHT \nThere is a \"For Sale\" sign posted in front.  The camera pans slowly as in the videotape across the front of the house. The interior of the house is dark, but fleetingly we are aware of movement, shadows inside. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ANDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nMarian and Raquel are in the living room, attired in the undergarments they purchased at the lingerie store.  HOT MUSIC is BLARING from a stereo.  Marian and Raquel are dancing, as sexy and wild as it is possible for them to be. Andy is lying on his back on the rug, dressed only in undershorts and socks, the girls stomping feet stepping furiously around his head and body.  His eyes are closed at first, but when he opens them, he sees their feet in a blur. He tries to get up, but he is too strung out, and he collapses again.  Marian and Raquel take him by his hands and feet and begin pulling him around the room as they dance. Andy is blitzed, smiling moronically.  The girls' breasts tumble out of their teddies.  Raquel drops her end of Andy, turns up the music even louder, and dances into a frenzy. Marian drops to her knees, Andy's feet on either side of her, shaking her shoulders and whipping her hair around.  Andy makes another attempt to sit up - he looks at Marian, reaches for her but falls back, dead to the world.  Raquel and Marian don't quit. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PRISON - FRED'S CELL - NIGHT \nFred is still curled on the floor, but spasms begin to rock his body.  He goes into convulsions, blood gushes from his nostrils.  His head is badly swollen.  Fred vomits repeatedly, and drags around in his mess.  Fred turns, straining upwards as we've seen him do before.  His face and head are hideously deformed. \nThe Warden stands up and comes around the desk. \nWARDEN I want to take a look at this man myself. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PRISON - INFIRMARY - DAY \nThe man from Fred's cell is just finishing being fingerprinted. \nThe doctor with serious eyebrows - DR. ROGOFF - is inspecting the man's face.  The Warden enters with Captain Henderson. GUARDS are standing by the door and at strategic spots in the room. \nWARDEN What is this, Rogoff? \nDR. ROGOFF I don't know yet. \nDr. Rogoff begins to draw blood from the man's arm. He takes several vials.  The man watches the blood coming out of his arm, but doesn't seem to understand where he is or what is happening to him. \nWARDEN Who is this man? \nDR. ROGOFF He's just been fingerprinted, and I'll run these blood tests right away.  We'll find out soon enough. \nDr. Rogoff opens the man's mouth and peers in with a pencil light. \nWARDEN He's not Madison? \nDR. ROGOFF (slowly, deliberately Not even close. \nDr. Rogoff stands up, puts the light in his breast pocket. \nDR. ROGOFF (CON'T) I examined Madison last night, Marshall. He had a headache. \nWARDEN A headache? \nDR. ROGOFF I did a routine once-over, and gave him a sleeping pill.  I've never seen this man before.  Neither have the guards.  I don't think he's in the system. \nThe Warden moves closer to the man - he looks closely at him. \nWARDEN Where the hell did you come from, mister? \nCLOSE UP OF THE MAN - he's staring straight up. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PRISON - WARDEN'S OFFICE - DAY \nPresent are the Warden, Captain Henderson and TWO other PRISON OFFICIALS.  The Warden is looking at a computer next to his desk. \nWARDEN Well, gentlemen, we know who the stranger is. His name is Peter Raymond Dayton. He's twenty-four years old.  His birthday is April 21st.  He was born and raised right here.  He lives with his parents, William and Claire Dayton at 814 Garland Avenue.  Pete Dayton was arrested five (MORE) \nWARDEN (cont'd) years ago for auto theft, for which he was put on probation for one year.  That was his first and only offense.  No record since then. \nWarden Clements looks up, takes a deep breath and stares at the men in front of him. \nWARDEN (CON-T) How about Madison?  Have we had even a hint of his whereabouts? \nCAPTAIN HENDERSON Nothing, Marsh.  Vanished.  There's an APB out on him.  His photo's been faxed nationwide. \nPRISON OFFICIAL #1 I had a call from the governor's office about this. \nWARDEN How the hell does she know? \nPRISON OFFICIAL #1 There's press outside right now. \nWARDEN How the hell... 7 \nCAPTAIN HENDERSON One of the guards must have leaked it. \nWARDEN What's the word on the street? \nPRISON OFFICIAL #2 Only that Madison has apparently escaped. Nothing about the other guy. \nWARDEN Good, let's keep it that way.  Keep a lid on Dayton.  Nothing gets out about him. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PRISON - DEATH ROW - DAY \nJohnny Mack walks down the row and enters Fred's cell. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PRISON - FRED'S CELL - DAY \nJohnny Mack looks around, up and down the walls, half peers under the cot, then - checking first to see no other guard is watching him - he looks inside the toilet bowl, then gets down on his knees and really looks under the cot.  He gets up and sits down on the bed.  He rubs a hand over his face. Johnny Mack is clearly perplexed. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PRISON - MEDIA ROOM - DAY \nA press conference is being held.  Present are REPORTERS, TV cameras, et al.  The Warden and Captain Henderson represent the prison. \nBILL The night before you showed up in the slammer... \nCLAIRE Do you remember? \nPETE No...

DAYTON HOUSE - PETE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nPete is stretched out on his bed watching television.  He hears the front door bell ring - footsteps, and a moment or two later the door to his bedroom opens and three of his friends, CARL, LANIE and STEVE (\"V\") saunter in. \n\"V\" Where the fuck have you been? \nPete pulls himself up to a sitting position. \nPETE Hey. \nCARL You look like shit. \nLANIE What happened? \nPETE Just haven't been feelin' well. \n\"V\" You're not contagious are you? \nPETE I don't think so. \n\"V\" Good...

What's wrong with that? \nPETE Listen. \n\"V\" You gotta be kiddin'... This is the boulevard...

ARNIE'S GARAGE - DAY \nMr. Eddy pulls slightly to the right of the road, pastes a polite, courteous smile on his face, puts his left arm out the window and waves the Infiniti by. \nThe Infiniti jets forward and swerves around the Pullman. When the cars are side by side, the irate DRIVER in the Infiniti gives Mr. Eddy \"the bird\" and flies past. \nCLOSE ON MR. EDDY'S RIGHT FOOT as it slams down on the gas pedal. \nThe Pullman catapults forward toward the Infiniti. \nPete is thrown back - he grabs on to the door handle and the seat for support. \nThe Pullman gains on the Infiniti in a flash.  The Infiniti tries to go faster, but Mr. Eddy's Pullman has much more power. \nMR. EDDY (clenched teeth) This is where power and mechanical excellence pays off. \nMr. Eddy jams the Pullman into the back of the Infiniti and pushes it faster and faster along Mulholland.  The Driver of the Infiniti tries to brake and blue-gray smoke streams out from beneath the Infiniti with a scream of burning rubber. \nAt a turn, Mr. Eddy steers his massive Mercedes and the Infiniti ahead on a gut-wrenching path off the road, up a mountain and into a little glade of trees.  Dust and brush fly everywhere. \nMr. Eddy and his assistants leap from the Pullman and make for the Driver's side of the Infiniti. \nMr. Eddy throws open the Infiniti's door and pulls the trembling and screaming Driver out like a rag doll. \nMr. Eddy pulls out his .44 Ruger Blackhawk and pistol whips the Driver to the ground.  He smashes the butt of his gun across the man's face, tearing a gash which starts to gush with blood. \nMr. Eddy's assistants each draw .45's and point them at the Driver. \nMr. Eddy, red-faced with anger, leans close to the man. \nMR.

I'll be bringin' the \"Caddy\" by tomorrow. \nPete opens his door and peers out. \nPete's POV down the hall toward the living room - his mother and father have stopped laughing and are turned with guilty smiles in his direction.  They are smoking a joint, passing it back and forth.  They are not looking directly at him. They seem to be looking, but not seeing. \nPete's parents POV down the hall toward Pete's room.  There is no one there - just an empty hallway. \nPete's parents continue to stare, but then turn away toward each other - they start to laugh quietly again. \nPete's Pov - the hallway and the living room - there is no one in the living room. It's empty. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

At first we hear nothing, then the sound of Al's piss streaming into an empty coffee cup.  The camera stays on the top of Al's head until he has completed the last few spurts of his micturition.  Al's head comes up and he opens the passenger side door and dumps the urine into the street.  He closes the door and zips up his trousers. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DAYTON HOUSE - PETE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT Pete paces the room.  Finally he stops himself, throws on his black leather jacket and opens his bedroom door.  He looks down the hall.

He looks in the other cars and looks at the GIRLS on the street. \nHe drives past \"Tops\", but doesn't see anyone he knows. \nHe turns off the boulevard and drives through San Fernando valley neighborhood streets. \nHe pulls up in front of Sheila's house and honks his horn. \nHe lights a cigarette while he waits. \nIn a few minutes Sheila comes out and leans in the passenger side window. \nSHEILA What do you want? \nPETE Nothin'... You want to go for a drive? \nSHEILA I don't know. \nPETE Come on... get in. \nSheila hesitates for a moment, then gets in. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

PETE'S CAMARO - NIGHT \nPete and Alice are riding side by side - Alice's head is on his shoulder. \nAlice looks up at Pete as he drives - she smiles. \nThe light from headlights behind them catch Alice's attention.  Her eyes dart back to a car that could be following them. \nALICE (fear) Is that car following us? \nPete glances in the rearview mirror - sees the headlights. \nAt the last moment he pulls a hard right and accelerates down the street.  The car follows - they both see it. \nPETE I'll lose 'em at the light. \nAlice steals a look back. \nALICE I don't recognize the car... \nAt a tralfic light, Pete revs up the big Camaro and expertly peels out between on-coming cross traffic.  He swerves between two cars going in opposite directions - blasts up a block and hangs a hard right - disappearing from view. \nEd and Al go out into the traffic after them, but the swerving, screeching cars braking around them form a barrier and trap them.  ANGRY DRIVERS lean on their horns. \nPete and Alice have lost them. \nFADE OUT: \nFADE IN: \nEXT. DAYTON HOUSE - NIGHT \nEstablish. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

CUT TO: \nINT. ARTHUR'S HIDEAWAY MOTEL - THE ROOM - NIGHT \nPete is making desperate love to Sheila in the same room - the same bed, as with Alice. \nSHEILA (whispered pain) Pete... Pete... \nPete keeps on - harder - obsessed. When he comes, he crashes down on Sheila, who wraps her arms around him tight.  She doesn't know what is going on with him.  Her eyes are open wide as she listens to his frantic breathing. \nShe doesn't know what to say - or what questions to ask. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

Your friend Sheila brought you here. \nPETE Sheila? \nBILL Yes, there was a man with you... She brought you here... She didn't know what else to do. \nPETE What is this? Why didn't you tell me?

I don't remember any of this. \nCLAIRE We know that. \nPETE Who was the man? \nBILL Never saw him before in my life. \nPETE Did you tell the police this? \nBILL We're not saying anything about that night to the police. We should all forget that night. \nPETE What happened to me? \nBill and Claire just stare at Pete. \nPETE (CON'T) Please tell me. \nBILL No. \nALICE I don't know. \nPETE We should stop seeing each other. \nALICE No... no. \nAlice moves closer to Pete and melts into him.  She places his hand on her breast and looks in his eyes. \nALICE (CON'T) I don't want to live without you. \nShe kisses Pete and pulls up her sweater to let him feel her bare breasts.  Pete kisses her back - lost in his longing for her. \nAlice breaks away. \nALICE (CON'T) We have to get away... We have to get some money. \nPete just stares at her. \nALICE (CON'T) I know a guy... He pays girls to party with him... He always has alotta cash... \nAlice puts her band up to Pete's cbeek and lets it drift around. \nALICE (CON'T) He'd be easy to rob... Then we'd have the money... and we could get away ... We'd be together. \nAlice kisses Pete's lips over and over - looking in his eyes. \nPETE Have you partied with him? \nALICE I used to. \nInside, Pete goes crazy with jealousy. \nPETE You like it? \nALICE No, honey... It was part of the deal. \nPETE What deal? \nALICE He works for Mr. Eddy. \nPETE What's he do? \nALICE He makes films for Mr. Eddy. \nPETE Pornos. \nALICE Yeah. \nPETE How'd you get in with these fuckin' people? \nALICE Pete...

A job... I didn't know what.  He set up an appointment for me to see a man. \nCUT TO: \nALICE'S STORY \nWe see Alice wearing a sexy tight dress in a plain room. It feels like we are inside of a large building - maybe an office building. \nAlice is waiting nervously. \nA SLICKSTER in shiny shirt and pants is leaning against a closed door. \nThere is another door off the room which is open onto a room where a MUSCLE MAN in tiny briefs is doing bench presses. \nNo one is saying anything. \nALICE (voiceover) I went to this place... They made me wait forever.  There was some guy guardin' the door... I started gettin' nervous... In another room I could see some guy liftin' (MORE) \nALICE (cont'd) weights... Both these guys gave me the creeps... They never said anything to me... So I just smoked cigarettes and waited. \nWe move in on a nervous EXHALE OF SMOKE to a CLOSE UP of Alice waiting. \nWe see a CLOSE UP of the man guarding the door. \nWe see a CLOSE SHOT of the man bench pressing a lot of weight. \nSuddenly, there are two knocks on the other side of the closed door.  The Slickster moves off the door and opens it a crack.  He talks quietly to someone Alice can't see, then he turns, opens the door and gestures for Alice to go through. \nAlice puts out her cigarette - her hand is shaking. \nShe walks over past the Slickster and enters a much larger room.  There are about FIFTEEN MEN in the room - all leaning comfortably at different points on the walls.  There is only one chair in the room - Mr. Eddy is sitting in it. \nNo one says anything to her, but one man nods his head and from this nod, Alice feels she should walk to the center of the room.  She does, and she instinctively turns to the man sitting in the chair. \nThey start to go at it again - at first slowly and tenderly - then wildly.  Alice tears herself away and looks up at Pete. \nALICE (CON'T) Are you my man? \nPETE (getting hotter) Yes. \nALICE Are you gonna be a man about this, Pete? \nPete looks at her - starting to understand what she means. \nALICE (CON'T) Are you? \nPete stares at her - then nods. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. DAYTON HOUSE - NIGHT \nPete drives up and parks his Camaro in the driveway.  When he gets out of the car, he sees Sheila standing by the front step.  She is looking in his direction, but doesn't seem to see him.  She SUDDENLY turns and looks up the street - she YELLS. \nSHEILA (total horror) THERE'S SOMEONE WITH HIM!! \nAs she yells, she starts to look around wildly - then her eyes follow the path the Camaro took into the driveway - then the path Pete took to where he has been standing all this time.  Her eyes find Pete and she stands by the front step. \nPETE (frightened) Sheila? \nShe heads toward him. \nPETE Sheila, what is it?... What are you doin' here? \nSHEILA You've been fucking somebody else haven't you? \nPETE Sheila... \nSHEILA You fuck me whenever you want... You don't call... Tell me who she is. \nSheila has come up and is grabbing Pete by the front of his shirt. \nPETE Hey... Sheila. \nSHEILA What's the BITCH'S name?! \nPETE Look Sheila... I'm sorry... \nSHEILA YOU'RE SORRY!! \nPETE Go home, Sheila. \nSheila starts beating him in the face and chest. \nSHEILA YOU'RE SORRY!! YOU PIECE OF SHIT!! YOU'RE SORRY!! \nShe starts crying and hitting him harder. \nSHEILA (CON'T) FUCK YOU!! \nSheila's screaming is reverberating around the neighborhood. INSIDE PETE'S MIND the SOUNDS are even LOUDER. \nBill comes out of the house.  Claire is behind him waiting on the front porch. \nSheila beats Pete and trips him to the ground.  She is sobbing as she tears at him. \nPETE Sheila... Stop... \nSHEILA FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU!! \nBill comes up to Sheila and takes her gently by the shoulders. \nSheila jerks around and looks up at Bill. \nBILL Why don't you two come inside and talk things over quietly... Come on... Come on in, Sheila. \nSheila gets to her feet - crying.  She looks down at Pete, who remains lying on the front lawn. \nFor Pete, every word and every sound is LOUD and DISTORTED. The DRONING SOUND returns. \nSHEILA (to Pete) You are different. \nBILL Sheila... \nSHEILA (to Bill) TELL HIM! \nThe phone inside the house starts to ring.  Claire turns in the doorway and goes to answer it. \nBILL Sheila... Don't. \nSHEILA I don't care anyway... I'm sorry, Mr. Dayton... I won't bother you or any member of your family again. \nSheila runs off crying.  Pete and Bill watch her go. \nClaire comes to the door. \nEXT. STREET - BUS STOP - NIGHT \nThe bus stops and Pete gets out.  He starts walking. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DEEP DELL PLACE - NIGHT \nWe see a street sign saying \"Deep Dell Place\".  Pete walks up the street looking at numbers. \nHe finds 2224 Deep Dell Place - Andy's House. \nHe stares at the house from the sidewalk. \nLights are on upstairs and down.  The hot wind moves big shadows of trees over the front of the house. \nPete looks at his watch.  It reads: 11:05 p.m. \nHe walks down the driveway, crosses through some bushes and comes to a fence separating the front yard from the back. \nHe stops and listens.  He pulls himself up and over the fence, but crashes on something on the other side. \nHe freezes - listening. He hears the wind blowing through the trees, and distant music from inside - a slow jazz piece. He hears echoing sounds of love making. \nHe makes his way around back - goes up the stairs and tries the back door.  It opens. \nCUT TO: INT. ANDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nPete sneaks through the kitchen and comes into the living room.  Pete stops short and stares.  A movie projector is running in the living room.  A porno film is being projected on a huge screen at the far end.  Alice is in the porno film. A man is fucking her from behind - with LOUD SLAPPING SOUNDS of flesh banging flesh.  Her face is in the foreground.  Her eyes look out directly at Pete.  She is loving every minute of it.  Inside Pete, jealousy starts to rage out of control. He looks around.  He sees clothes scattered about.  He picks up a girl's sweater and smells it.  He looks up the stairs. \nFeet appear at the top of the stairs.  They start down. \nPete runs for the bar. \nAlong the way, he grabs a heavy, bronze figurine of a well- stacked woman off a rectangular glass-topped coffee table, and ducks behind the bar. \nHe can hear Andy approaching.  He can hear Andy gather two glasses.  He can hear Alice being fucked harder in the porno film.  He clenches his teeth with rage. \nSuddenly, Andy moves right in front of him.  They see each other.  Andy's eyes widen - Pete leaps up, and thwacks the bronze figurine down on the top of Andy's head.  Andy falls. The breasts of the figurine have made two bloody holes in his forehead. \nPete turns. \nAlice is coming quickly down the stairway - naked, except for a pair of panties.  Lipstick is smeared around her mouth. She is carrying a half-filled pillowcase.  Her porno film is playing on the wall behind her. \nThese images jump and spin in Pete's mind.  He moves unsteadily toward her. \nALICE You got him. \nPETE (still holding the figurine) Alice, I... \nPete starts to tremble.  He drops the figurine.  He tries to embrace her. \nThere is a crashing noise behind him. \nPete turns and sees Andy staggering, blood streaming from the wound in his head, THEN CHARGING FULL SPEED AT PETE. \nAndy hits him hard, and Pete goes down.  When Pete hits the ground, he pushes Andy up and throws out his arms.  This, and Andy's momentum, catapult Andy into the corner of the rectangular glass-topped coffee table.  There is a sound like a hammer going through a bucket of eggs as the glass corner embeds about eight inches into Andy's forehead. \nCLOSE UP OF ANDY'S HEAD - impaled on the sharp corner of the table, his chest area suspended, his legs and stomach touching the floor. \nALICE (amazement - no feeling) Wow! \nPete pulls himself off the floor. \nPete moves close to Alice, they drift to the glass coffee table, staring for a few moments at Andy's dead body. \nWhile Pete stares, unbelieving, at Andy - Alice hurriedly picks up her sweater and puts it on. On the sofa next to it lay Andy's trousers.  She goes through the pockets, finds a roll of cash bound by a rubber band.  Alice hands the roll to Pete. \nALICE (CON'T) Put this in your pocket. \nAlice kneels next to Andy's body and quickly removes his Rolex wristwatch, a couple of rings and the gold chain dangling from his neck.  These items she puts inside the empty pillowcase. \nAlice finds the rest of her clothes scattered about the living room and puts them on.  Pete watches her, trembling, unable to say anything. \nShe comes back to Pete, who starts breathing irregularly, hyperventilating. \nALICE (CON'T) You all right? \nPETE, We killed him. \nALICE You killed him. \nPETE Alice? \nAlice slides up close to Pete. \nALICE It was an accident... Accidents happen every day. \nPete clutches her, eyes squeezed tight, as if he is holding on for dear life. \nPETE Alice... \nPete's POV: He watches Alice ring the doorbell.  She waits in front of the door for a few moments, her hair blowing in the wind. \nA HOUSEBOY opens the door.  Alice says something to him - Pete cannot bear anything that is said, even though his driver's side window is down.  All he can hear is the hot wind blowing. \nThe Houseboy moves out to where he can see Pete, waiting in the car.  The Houseboy and Alice exchange information.  The Houseboy points out toward the desert.  Alice turns back to the car. The Houseboy watches her. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ANDY'S CAR - NIGHT \nAlice gets into the car. \nALICE Come on. \nPete starts the car and begins backing it out the drive.  The Houseboy is still standing - watching them. \nALICE (CON'T) We have to go to the desert.  He's at his cabin. \nPete and Alice drive off.  The Houseboy continues to watch them. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DESERT - TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nWe see the clean moving POV illuminated by headlights.  We're floating down an old two-lane highway through a desolate, desert landscape. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DESERT - NIGHT \nPete and Alice pull off the two-lane highway onto a barely discernible dirt road that cuts through the dark desert. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DESERT - NIGHT \nPete and Alice drive up to a ONE ROOM CABIN built on stilts next to a dry lakebed.  They both get out and go up the stairs to a porch where Alice knocks on the door.  There is no answer. \nAlice opens the door, but there is NOBODY INSIDE. \nALICE We'll have to wait. \nThe hot wind continues to blow. \nAlice and Pete walk back down to the car. \nThe HEADLIGHTS are on and Alice reaches in through the window and switches on the RADIO.  She can't get anything in but static, with bits and pieces of old tunes fading in and out. She hits the \"seek\" button.  The radio starts to search. \nPete is standing in the glare of the headlights watching her. Alice walks slowly to him. \nThe camera captures this from a back seat perspective - then drifts toward them. \nPETE Why me, Alice?  Why choose me? \nThe radio sticks on a particular tune - a tune filled with longing. Alice begins to dance.  She takes Pete's hand and pulls him close to her. \nALICE So we can be together... You still want to be with me, don't you Pete? \nAlice gives Pete that wild smile. \nALICE (CON'T) More than ever? \nShe kisses Pete over and over.  He begins to kiss her back. She starts to move him in a dance to the music in the glare of the headlights, the hot wind caressing them. \nThe scene is out of a dream.  Alice and Pete help each other undress as they dance in and out of the light, and the wind whips at their bodies. \nThey sink down on the soft ground and start making love. \nThe lights from the headlights combine with the starlight, bathing them in a pristine glow. \nThe music fades and the radio begins to \"seek\" through static for another station.  The music it finds now is LOUD and INTENSE. \nAlice - her hunger appearing, now becomes carnivorous in her approach to love making with Pete.  She is the aggressor, highly-charged - she wants more and more - taking, not giving, insatiable. \nThe headlights flare their bodies in blinding light.  They become amorphous, glowing shapes burning in the light. \nPete is trying desperately to please her - to have her. \nThe driving music fills with cracks of piercing static.  The radio strains to hold the station. \nPete's white-hot body clings to Alice.  He chokes with emotion. \nPETE I want you... I want you... \nWith a burning smile, Alice rolls them out of the beams of light into the darkness.  The wind billows a black cloud of dust around them. \nAlice pulls away from Pete and brings her dark mouth to his ear. \nALICE You'll never have me. \nAlice glides away from Pete and stands up looking down at him from above. \nFred closes his eyes. \nFADE OUT: \nFADE IN: \nINT.

Al looks at it. \nAL It's her, all right.  Fred Madison's wife ... with Dick Laurent and Mr. Dent- head over there. \nCLOSE UP ON THE PHOTOGRAPH - that shows RENEE AS THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE PICTURE, standing between Andy and Mr. Eddy/ Laurent. \nAL We've got Pete Dayton's prints all over this place. \nED You know what I think? \nAL What's that, Ed? \nED There's no such thing as a bad coincidence. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LOST HIGHWAY HOTEL - ROOM 26 - PRE-DAWN \nRenee is sitting half dressed on the edge of the bed, pulling on her stockings.  Mr. Eddy/Laurent is asleep next to her. Renee stands up, finishes dressing, then leans down and kisses her lover while he sleeps.  Renee leaves the room, closing the door as quietly as possible behind her. \nAs the door CLICKS, Mr. Eddy/Laurent wakes up.  He sits up and gets a pack of cigarettes from the bedside table, shakes one out, lights it with a book of \"Lost Highway Hotel\" matches, and smokes it while seated on the edge of the bed. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LOST HIGHWAY HOTEL - ROOM 25 - PRE-DAWN \nFred, still fully dressed, is waking up, AS IF IN A TRANCE - the same attitude he had on the videotape.  He strains upwards and looks eerily around the room.  He gets up and crosses slowly to a window.  He takes the edge of the window curtain and pulls it back. \nThe view is of the gravel parking lot of the hotel. \nFred's POV: He sees Renee, down below, walk over to a car, get in and drive away. \nFred walks back to his bed, picks up his revolver from under the pillow, crosses the room to the door and walks out. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LOST HIGHWAY HOTEL - CORRIDOR - PRE-DAWN \nFred crosses over to Room 26 and knocks softly on the door. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LOST HIGHWAY HOTEL - ROOM 26 - PRE-DAWN \nMr. Eddy/Laurent is standing - almost dressed, when he hears the knock. \nMR. EDDY/LAURENT Renee? \nHe goes to the door and opens it a crack. \nAs the door opens, Fred smashes the gun into Mr. Eddy/ Laurent's face and pushes his way inside the room. \nFred hits Mr. Eddy/Laurent viciously again with the gun barrel. \nMr. Eddy/Laurent is bleeding profusely from gashes on his forehead and nose. \nMR. EDDY/LAURENT What the fuck? What's going on? \nFRED (pointing the gun at him) You're coming with me. \nFred puts the pistol up against Mr. Eddy/Laurent's head and marches him out of the room - past the camera's eye. \nThe camera stays in the room and moves slowly toward the window, through which we see Fred and Mr. Eddy/Laurent appear down below in the back lot. \nStill watching out the window, the camera sees Fred knock Mr. Eddy/Laurent over the head with the gun butt and put him into the trunk of a car.  Fred slams the trunk lid and climbs into the driver's side of what is obviously Mr. Eddy/Laurent's car - the Mercedes 600 Pullman. \nAs Fred drives away, a HAND appears in our window foreground. The hand moves the window curtain further to one side.  The camera pulls back to reveal it as the hand of the Mystery Man.  The Mystery Man leans fully into the frame and watches Fred drive off down the Lost Highway as day breaks. \n", "test1_input": "Lost Highway \nA 21st Century Noir Horror Film. \nA graphic investigation into parallel identity crises. \nA world where time is dangerously out of control. \nA terrifying ride down the lost highway. \nDavid Lynch 21 June 1995 \nAS CREDITS ROLL \nEXT.

In the darkness, there starts the sound of a motor which draws curtains back across a large picture window just off screen.  As the curtain moves, hard-edged light begins crawling across the room, and we see everything clearly.  Fred is wearing a robe and pajamas, it's early morning. \nCLOSE UP ON FRED'S FACE IN THE MIRROR - Blank expression - face somewhat obscured or distorted by smoke from the cigarette. \nCLOSE UP 0N FRED'S ACTUAL FACE - Unshaven, haggard look, eyes seem empty, glazed over.  Fred is 32 years old, with dark hair. \nTHE DOORBELL RINGS.  Fred looks up, startled by the noise. He looks at the digital clock: 5:30 a.m. \nFRED STANDS, goes to an INTERCOM on the wall next to the mirror.  He pushes a button. \nA VOICE comes over the intercom. \nVOICE OVER INTERCOM Dick Laurent is dead. \nFred leaves the bedroom and goes through the house.  He is on the upstairs level.  He looks through a narrow slot window, but can't see the front door below.  He goes further in the house to a picture window that overlooks the street below. There is NOBODY there. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

This is Fred's wife, RENEE, 30 years old, dark hair, dressed smartly, a drink in her hand. \nRENEE You don't mind that I'm not coming tonight? \nFRED What are you going to do? \nRENEE I thought I'd stay home and read. \nFred looks her over, she's sexy without trying. \nFRED Read?... Read what, Renee? \nRenee sits down on a couch and sips her drink.  Fred comes over to her, kisses her on the neck, which makes her laugh. \nFRED It's nice to know I can still make you laugh. \nRENEE I like to laugh, Fred. \nFRED That's why I married you. \nRENEE Wake me up when you get home. \nFred brushes her cheek with his fingers, allowing them to linger for a moment on her face. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

THE MADISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nRenee opens the manila envelope. She's noticeably nervous when she sees a videotape inside.  She stares at it. \nFred enters, also wearing a bathrobe.  He sees Renee staring at the videotape - before she hears him enter.  When she does hear him, her eyes jerk away from the tape. \nFRED What's that? \nRENEE A videotape. \nFRED Who's it from? \nRENEE I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it. \nFRED Does it say anything on the tape? \nRENEE (looking it over) No, nothing. \nFred walks over and picks up the tape. \nFRED Well, let's see what's on it. \nFred takes the tape to the VCR.  He inserts it into the machine, and turns it on.  Fred goes toward the couch. \nFRED (CON'T) (to Renee) Come on. \nThey sit on the couch in front of the television. \nThe TV monitor: We begin on the TV, then the videotape fills the entire frame.  The videotape shows the front of THE MADISON HOUSE, the camera panning slowly over it.  The picture is accompanied by an eerie DRONING SOUND.  After the camera pans back to the front door, the tape image turns to snow. \nFred and Renee stare at the snow for a few moments.  Renee looks relieved. \nRENEE It must be from a real estate agent. \nFRED Maybe. \nWe see a WIDE SHOT encompassing Fred, Renee, and the snowy image on the TV. \nFADE OUT: \nFADE IN: \nINT. THE MADISON HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY \nRenee is seated at the dining room table - coffee cup and grapefruit in front of her.  She is wearing glasses, reading a book.  Fred enters, and sees Renee, who does not look up or acknowledge him.  Fred goes into the kitchen, which is just off the dining room.  He comes back into the dining room with a cup of coffee, and sits down with it opposite Renee.  He lights up a cigarette, sips his coffee, and looks at her. \nFRED Good book, huh? \n", "test1_id": 3177, "test2_input": "Fred's POV - moving creepily room by room through the dark house - past the telephone - down the hall to the bedroom. \nThere is NO ONE there. \nHe goes back outside for Renee. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

THE MADISON HOUSE - NIGHT \nFred switches on more lights. \nRENEE It's so odd... Waiting out there, I had the strangest feeling... Like this had happened before.  I mean, your telling me to stay outside while you went in like that. \nFred looks at Renee, then continues to look around the house, disturbed, seriously disquieted.  Renee, still tipsy, follows him, moving from room to room. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE MADISON HOUSE - BEDROOM, ETC. - NIGHT \nFred and Renee are preparing to go to bed.

THE MADISON HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT Renee's POV - down the hallway.  There is just darkness at the end of the hall.  It is EERIE.  After a moment, Fred slowly walks out of the darkness toward Renee.  He walks out of the shot and the camera remains on the rectangle of darkness at the end of the hall. \nFADE OUT: \nFADE IN: \nINT. THE MADISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY Footsteps can be heard on the stairs.  Fred's head appears at the top of the stairway.  He comes up into the living room carrying a manila envelope, like the ones previously received.  His expression is strained.  He is alone.  Fred pulls a videotape out of the envelope and inserts it in the VCR, turns it on.  He sits on the couch and watches.  We go from a WIDE SHOT to a FULL FRAME SHOT of the video. \nOn the tape is the same nighttime interior of the house, accompanied by the DRONING SOUND.  The camera moves eerily down the hall toward the bedroom, sliding at a high angle. The camera turns slowly into the bedroom - looking down. \nBLOOD is splattered over the floor, bed, walls.  The camera drifts.  THE DEAD BODY OF RENEE lies on the floor at the foot of the bed.  She is badly mutilated.  Fred is hovering over her on the tape, ON HIS KNEES, A HORRIFIED, UNBELIEVING EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE.  On the tape, Fred turns away from Renee - his hands raised, dripping blood - her blood.  His movements are almost mechanical, constricted, as he strains strangely upwards seemingly against his will, as if feeling some enormous pressure.  He looks directly at the camera, his face a ghastly grimace, contorted, just before the taped image goes to snow. \n", "test2_true": "INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nFred, sitting in front of the TV, shudders as the tape ends. He sits trembling, attempts to speak, almost chokes, and finally releases a tortured, warbly cry. \nFRED Renee! \nFred looks up as if seeing something, he starts to stand, -staggering, partially paralyzed. \nFRED (CON'T) (Shouting) RENEE! \nCUT TO: \nINT.

Inside the house, INVESTIGATORS and FORENSIC EXPERTS are moving around, measuring, scraping samples of carpet, searching for fingerprints on furniture. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CITY MORGUE - NIGHT \nRenee's CORPSE on a slab is rolled into an examining room by an ATTENDANT.  The entrance of the body is shown reflected in a chrome-framed mirror that juts out from a tile wall.  The Attendant prepares for the impending autopsy, laying out a rack of instruments, positioning the corpse.  As he is doing these things, the MEDICAL EXAMINER enters, accompanied by his GIRLFRIEND.  The M.E. is dressed formally, in a tuxedo.  The young woman is wearing a slinky dress with a fur wrap, pearls, spike heels.  The couple are close; she has an arm through his, and she laughs, nervously.  He is smoking a cigarette. \nATTENDANT Hi, doc. Workin' late tonight, huh? \nM.E. Party at the mayor's house, George.  This is his daughter, Joyce. \nATTENDANT Howdy, Joyce. \nJOYCE Howdy, George. \nThe Attendant uncovers the body - individual parts are wrapped like packages from a butcher's shop, and labeled: L. ARM, HEAD, R. BREST (misspelled). \nM.E. (looking at the packages) Just like Christmas. \nHe begins to unwrap them. \nJOYCE I don't know if I can watch this. \nThe M.E. tosses his cigarette down on the floor.  The camera goes down on the smoking cigarette butt on the floor drain; smoldering there among hair and flesh gristle on the drain's filter screen. \nM.E. (Voice-over) Leave any time you want, lover.  I won't take it personally. \nThe camera stays on the drain as we HEAR the M.E. unwrapping the packaged body parts.  Joyce's high heels enter the frame around the drain.  She is stepping nervously, like a spooked horse.  The clatter of her heels is very loud.  We hear the M.E. chuckle. \nM.E. (Voice-over) Easy, girl, easy. \nJOYCE You talking to me or... her? \nM.E. (laughs) A corpse can tell you plenty, Joyce. \nCUT TO: \nINT. COURTROOM - DAY \nThe camera is behind a female FOREMAN in the jury box.

Over her right shoulder the JUDGE is seated. \nJUDGE Have you reached a verdict? \nFOREMAN Yes, we have, your honor. \nJUDGE Please hand it to the bailiff. \nThe BAILIFF goes to the Foreman, takes the paper from her, then takes it to the Judge.  The Judge opens it and reads it to himself, then hands it back to the Bailiff, who returns it to the Foreman. \nJUDGE And what is your verdict? \nThe camera moves to Fred, registering his tension.  The camera goes to the Foreman's face. \nFOREMAN We the jury find the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree. \nFred faints.  Fe is lifted up by his ATTORNEY and GUARDS in attendance.

Dr. Rogoff returns with Pete Dayton, dressed in his own clothes: jeans, boots, sport shirt. Pete's forehead is lumpy and his eyes are red and swollen. He can walk, but unsteadily. \nPete looks around the room - sees his parents. \nClaire jumps up. \nCLAIRE (tenderly) Pete... \nShe and Dr. Rogoff help get Pete settled in a chair.  Bill is taken aback at the sight of his son, but says nothing. \nWARDEN (CON'T) Pete, can you tell us now, anything about this? \nCLAIRE Pete, what happened to you? \nPete has a dazed look on his face.  He starts to speak, then stops. \nCLAIRE (CON'T) It's okay.

ROGOFF (to Warden) From a medical standpoint, I don't see why not. \nCAPTAIN HENDERSON We need to find out what happened here. \nBILL (standing up) Have you made any charges against him? \nWARDEN No. \nBILL Then he's coming home with his mother and me. \nWARDEN All right... but you see our predicament... Legally we can't hold him, but he may be able to help us... perhaps later.  For now, he's free to leave. \nBill and Claire help Pete up and carefully escort him out of the warden's office. With a nod from the Warden, the guard accompanies them out of the room.

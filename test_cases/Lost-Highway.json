THE MADISON HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT \nRenee is standing next to the car, shivering. \nFRED I told you to stay in the car! \nRENEE Why? what is it?  Why did you make me wait out here? \nFRED I thought there might be somebody inside. \nRENEE Was there? \nFRED No... of course not. \nThey enter the house. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE MADISON HOUSE - NIGHT \nFred switches on more lights. \nRENEE It's so odd... Waiting out there, I had the strangest feeling... Like this had happened before.  I mean, your telling me to stay outside while you went in like that. \nFred looks at Renee, then continues to look around the house, disturbed, seriously disquieted.  Renee, still tipsy, follows him, moving from room to room. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE MADISON HOUSE - BEDROOM, ETC. - NIGHT \nFred and Renee are preparing to go to bed. Renee goes\tinto the bathroom off the bedroom. Fred takes another look\tout into the hallway. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE MADISON HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT \nFred walks down the hallway. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE MADISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nFred looks around the dark living room.  Then absentmindedly, he begins to inspect objects.  He picks up an ashtray and studies it - lost in thought. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE MADISON HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT \nRenee is washing her face, standing at the sink in her slip. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE MADISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nFred is staring at himself in a mirror. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE MADISON HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nRenee comes in.  Fred is not there.

THE MADISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nNo one is in the living room now - but a SHADOW moves slowly across a wall. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE MADISON HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT Renee's POV - down the hallway.  There is just darkness at the end of the hall.  It is EERIE.  After a moment, Fred slowly walks out of the darkness toward Renee.  He walks out of the shot and the camera remains on the rectangle of darkness at the end of the hall. \nFADE OUT: \nFADE IN: \nINT. THE MADISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY Footsteps can be heard on the stairs.  Fred's head appears at the top of the stairway.  He comes up into the living room carrying a manila envelope, like the ones previously received.  His expression is strained.  He is alone.  Fred pulls a videotape out of the envelope and inserts it in the VCR, turns it on.  He sits on the couch and watches.  We go from a WIDE SHOT to a FULL FRAME SHOT of the video. \nOn the tape is the same nighttime interior of the house, accompanied by the DRONING SOUND.  The camera moves eerily down the hall toward the bedroom, sliding at a high angle. The camera turns slowly into the bedroom - looking down. \nBLOOD is splattered over the floor, bed, walls.  The camera drifts.  THE DEAD BODY OF RENEE lies on the floor at the foot of the bed.  She is badly mutilated.  Fred is hovering over her on the tape, ON HIS KNEES, A HORRIFIED, UNBELIEVING EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE.  On the tape, Fred turns away from Renee - his hands raised, dripping blood - her blood.  His movements are almost mechanical, constricted, as he strains strangely upwards seemingly against his will, as if feeling some enormous pressure.  He looks directly at the camera, his face a ghastly grimace, contorted, just before the taped image goes to snow. \n", "test1_true": "INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nFred, sitting in front of the TV, shudders as the tape ends. He sits trembling, attempts to speak, almost chokes, and finally releases a tortured, warbly cry. \nFRED Renee! \nFred looks up as if seeing something, he starts to stand, -staggering, partially paralyzed. \nFRED (CON'T) (Shouting) RENEE! \nCUT TO: \nINT.

Ed and Al are standing in front of Fred. \nED Stay put, killer! \nThe Detectives' POV: Fred's face is a bloody mask.  He is crying, whimpering. \nFRED I didn't kill her! Tell me I didn't kill her! \nCUT TO: \nINT. JAIL CELL - DAY \nFred, his lips and eyes swollen, sits on a cot, dressed in jail clothes.  He studies his hands, which appear crippled. He flexes the fingers, slowly, painfully. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE MADISON HOUSE - DAY \nWe are in back of the house tracking slowly past the bedroom and living room windows. Inside the house, INVESTIGATORS and FORENSIC EXPERTS are moving around, measuring, scraping samples of carpet, searching for fingerprints on furniture. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CITY MORGUE - NIGHT \nRenee's CORPSE on a slab is rolled into an examining room by an ATTENDANT.  The entrance of the body is shown reflected in a chrome-framed mirror that juts out from a tile wall.  The Attendant prepares for the impending autopsy, laying out a rack of instruments, positioning the corpse.  As he is doing these things, the MEDICAL EXAMINER enters, accompanied by his GIRLFRIEND.  The M.E. is dressed formally, in a tuxedo.  The young woman is wearing a slinky dress with a fur wrap, pearls, spike heels.  The couple are close; she has an arm through his, and she laughs, nervously.  He is smoking a cigarette. \nATTENDANT Hi, doc. Workin' late tonight, huh? \nM.E. Party at the mayor's house, George.  This is his daughter, Joyce. \nATTENDANT Howdy, Joyce. \nJOYCE Howdy, George. \nThe Attendant uncovers the body - individual parts are wrapped like packages from a butcher's shop, and labeled: L. ARM, HEAD, R. BREST (misspelled). \nM.E. (looking at the packages) Just like Christmas. \nHe begins to unwrap them. \nJOYCE I don't know if I can watch this. \nThe M.E. tosses his cigarette down on the floor.  The camera goes down on the smoking cigarette butt on the floor drain; smoldering there among hair and flesh gristle on the drain's filter screen. \nM.E. (Voice-over) Leave any time you want, lover.  I won't take it personally. \nThe camera stays on the drain as we HEAR the M.E. unwrapping the packaged body parts.  Joyce's high heels enter the frame around the drain.  She is stepping nervously, like a spooked horse.  The clatter of her heels is very loud.  We hear the M.E. chuckle. \nM.E. (Voice-over) Easy, girl, easy. \nJOYCE You talking to me or... her? \nM.E. (laughs) A corpse can tell you plenty, Joyce. \nCUT TO: \nINT. COURTROOM - DAY \nThe camera is behind a female FOREMAN in the jury box.  The shot begins on her shoes and travels up her body as she stands.  Over her left shoulder we see Fred standing at the defense table. Over her right shoulder the JUDGE is seated. \nJUDGE Have you reached a verdict? \nFOREMAN Yes, we have, your honor. \nJUDGE Please hand it to the bailiff. \nThe BAILIFF goes to the Foreman, takes the paper from her, then takes it to the Judge.  The Judge opens it and reads it to himself, then hands it back to the Bailiff, who returns it to the Foreman. \nJUDGE And what is your verdict? \nThe camera moves to Fred, registering his tension.  The camera goes to the Foreman's face. \nFOREMAN We the jury find the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree. \nFred faints.  Fe is lifted up by his ATTORNEY and GUARDS in attendance.  Fred revives slightly. \nJUDGE Fred Madison, the jury having found you guilty of murder in the first degree, it is my order that on a date to be determined, you be put to death in the electric chair. \n", "test1_id": 3177, "test2_input": "CLAIRE I want to see him. \nWARDEN Yes, and we need to talk to him... if we can. (to Dr. Rogoff) Mel, let's get Peter in here. \nDr. Rogoff leaves the room.  While he's gone, nobody talks, increasing the tension.  Dr. Rogoff returns with Pete Dayton, dressed in his own clothes: jeans, boots, sport shirt. Pete's forehead is lumpy and his eyes are red and swollen. He can walk, but unsteadily. \nPete looks around the room - sees his parents. \nClaire jumps up. \nCLAIRE (tenderly) Pete... \nShe and Dr. Rogoff help get Pete settled in a chair.  Bill is taken aback at the sight of his son, but says nothing. \nWARDEN (CON'T) Pete, can you tell us now, anything about this? \nCLAIRE Pete, what happened to you? \nPete has a dazed look on his face.  He starts to speak, then stops. \nCLAIRE (CON'T) It's okay.  Take your time, honey. \nPete's gaze drifts from his mother's face around the room and back to her face. \nPETE (afraid - quiet) Where ... am I? \nThe Warden and Captain Henderson look to Dr. Rogoff. \nDR. ROGOFF You're in the state penitentiary.  You were found in a cell on death row. \nPETE My head hurts. \nPete rubs his head like it's about to explode with pain. \nWARDEN A man named Fred Madison was occupying that cell.  He's missing. we're trying to find out how it is you were in there and not him. \nPETE I... I don't know. \nCAPTAIN HENDERSON Do you know Fred Madison? \nPETE (straining) No. \nThere is a silence in the room, as Pete massages his throbbing temples. \nCLAIRE (worried) Warden, can we take him home? \nThe Warden looks at Dr. Rogoff. \nDR. ROGOFF (to Warden) From a medical standpoint, I don't see why not. \nCAPTAIN HENDERSON We need to find out what happened here. \nBILL (standing up) Have you made any charges against him? \nWARDEN No. \nBILL Then he's coming home with his mother and me. \nWARDEN All right... but you see our predicament... Legally we can't hold him, but he may be able to help us... perhaps later.  For now, he's free to leave. \nBill and Claire help Pete up and carefully escort him out of the warden's office. With a nod from the Warden, the guard accompanies them out of the room.  The Warden, Captain Henderson and Dr. Rogoff stand but remain in the office. \nCAPTAIN HENDERSON (to warden) You just gonna let him go? \nWARDEN We'll get a tail put on him. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DAYTON HOUSE - SAN FERNANDO VALLEY - DAY \nBill, Claire and Pete pull into the driveway of a bleached out, 60's ranch-style house on a street lined with many more of the same. \nBill and Claire get out of the car first, then help Pete out and up into the house. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DAYTON HOUSE - DAY \nBill and Claire take Pete to his room, which has a bed, desk, two chairs and a sea of disassembled motorcycle parts belonging to a classic Indian motorbike which Pete is rebuilding.

DAYTON HOUSE - DAY \nAn unmarked police car pulls up across the street from the Dayton house.  In the front seat are the Detectives, Ed and Al. Al, who is on the passenger side, is holding two styrofoam cups filled with coffee.  Ed removes from his inside jacket pocket a 5\" x 7\" photo of Pete Dayton, which he props up on the dashboard so that it is visible for both himself and Al.  Al hands one of the cups to Ed. \nED Thanks, Al. \nAl studies Pete Dayton's face in the photo. \nAL Now we'll see what this son of a bitch is up to. \nED Yeah. \nEd and Al sip their coffee and stare at the house. \nFADE OUT: \nFADE IN: \nEXT. DAYTON HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY \nPete Dayton is lying on a chaise lounge.  His forehead is still swollen, but his eyes are less red.  He stares up into the sky - a hot breeze blows over him. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DAYTON HOUSE - DAY \nThe camera moves slowly through the interior of the empty house cast with shadows.  The refrigerator running is the only sound. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DAYTON HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY \nPete slowly moves up to a sitting position, then stands.  He stretches and walks around the yard feeling the dry, unwatered lawn on his bare feet. \nHe walks over and leans over the neighbor's fence.  His eyes fall on a plastic toy boat floating in b child's plastic swimming pool.  He watches the boat as the warm breeze blows it lazily in a circle. \nA small plane drones overhead. \nIn the distance, a WOMAN finishes hanging out some wash and goes in the back door of her house.  The slamming of her screen door sounds a thousand miles away. \nPete continues to observe these seemingly peaceful surroundings - but something doesn't feel right to him. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DAYTON HOUSE - NIGHT \nPete is eating a sandwich - he is looking much better. Claire opens a bag of chips and sets them in front of Pete as Bill comes in the front door. \nCLAIRE I'm in the kitchen. \nBill comes in and pops a beer - looks around. \nBILL Where's Pete? \nCLAIRE Out in back. \nBILL You talk to him? \nCLAIRE (urgent) No...

When the cars are side by side, the irate DRIVER in the Infiniti gives Mr. Eddy \"the bird\" and flies past. \nCLOSE ON MR. EDDY'S RIGHT FOOT as it slams down on the gas pedal. \nThe Pullman catapults forward toward the Infiniti. \nPete is thrown back - he grabs on to the door handle and the seat for support. \nThe Pullman gains on the Infiniti in a flash.  The Infiniti tries to go faster, but Mr. Eddy's Pullman has much more power. \nMR. EDDY (clenched teeth) This is where power and mechanical excellence pays off. \nMr. Eddy jams the Pullman into the back of the Infiniti and pushes it faster and faster along Mulholland.  The Driver of the Infiniti tries to brake and blue-gray smoke streams out from beneath the Infiniti with a scream of burning rubber. \nAt a turn, Mr. Eddy steers his massive Mercedes and the Infiniti ahead on a gut-wrenching path off the road, up a mountain and into a little glade of trees.  Dust and brush fly everywhere. \nMr. Eddy and his assistants leap from the Pullman and make for the Driver's side of the Infiniti. \nMr. Eddy throws open the Infiniti's door and pulls the trembling and screaming Driver out like a rag doll. \nMr. Eddy pulls out his .44 Ruger Blackhawk and pistol whips the Driver to the ground.  He smashes the butt of his gun across the man's face, tearing a gash which starts to gush with blood. \nMr. Eddy's assistants each draw .45's and point them at the Driver. \nMr. Eddy, red-faced with anger, leans close to the man. \nMR.

ARNIE'S GARAGE - DAY \nPete is on a skate - working under a car.  The radio is on and a tune comes on that begins to drive Pete crazy - it gives him a headache.  The tune is one of Fred Madison's be- bop saxophone pieces.  Pete gets out from under the car and goes to the radio.  He changes the station.  PHIL, another mechanic working nearby, looks at Pete. \nPHIL Why'd you change it?  I liked that. \nPETE Well, I didn't. \nPete rubs his throbbing head and when he gets back under the car, he lays on the skate - unable to work. \nA car horn honks and the sound reverberates inside the garage. \nPete looks up - from under the car he sees the wheels of a Cadillac roll up just outside the open garage doors.  He sees a car door open and Mr. Eddy's feet appear and walk in his direction. \nPete winces and wheels himself out from under the car.  He stands as Mr. Eddy walks up to him, then freezes as he sees - back behind Mr. Eddy, sitting in the passenger seat of the car - a beautiful blonde-haired GIRL, who looks exactly like Renee. \nCLOSE UP BEAUTIFUL GIRL - she looks exactly like Renee except she is about eight years younger.  The girl is staring right into Pete's eyes. \nMr. Eddy steps between Pete and the girl - blocking her from Pete.  Mr. Eddy smiles at Pete - not noticing or not letting on that he notices the serious eye contact going on between Pete and the girl. \nMR. EDDY I'm leavin' the Caddy, like I told you. Think you'll get a chance to give her a once over today? \nPETE (regaining his composure) Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy.  You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow? \nMR. EDDY If you think you can finish it, I'll be back later today. \nPETE It'll be ready. \nMR. EDDY You're my man, Pete. \nMr Eddy pinches Pete's cheek - which Pete doesn't like, but aliows.  Mr. Eddy gives Pete a big smile then turns, goes back to his car, escorts the beautiful girl outside where the Pullman is waiting. \nPete watches her walk and move.  He watches her until Mr. Eddy drives her away.  She steals one last glance back at Pete before she disappears. \nWhen she is gone, Pete replays the scene of seeing this beautiful girl over again in his mind.  The scene is accompanied by Lou Reed's version of \"This Magic Moment\". \nFADE OUT: \nFADE IN: \nINT. DAYTON HOUSE - NIGHT \nPete is sitting perched unsteadily on the very edge of his bed.  He HEARS a succession of highly-amplified SOUNDS at intervals with eerie stretches of silence: CRICKETS in fractured cadence a distant TELEVISION - a FLY buzzing slowly in the room a MOTH'S wings beating against light bulbs in the ceiling fixture - the washing of DISHES. \nPete's reaction to these sounds is one of petrified confusion.  Underlying these sounds is a kind of unearthly, steady DRONE. \nPete gets up off the bed, unsteadily.  He moves toward his bedroom door.  As he moves the amplified SOUNDS shift. \nHe can hear laughter.  The laughter seems to be LOUD, but at the same time coming from people who are trying to contain the laughter - to hide it. \n", "test3_id": 3179}

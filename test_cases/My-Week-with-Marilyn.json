{"test1_input": "40 INT. LONDON AIRPORT. HALL. DAY. 40 \nMARILYN sits with MILLER at her side, flanked by OLIVIER and VIVIEN. MARILYN wears a large pair of sunglasses. PHOTOGRAPHERS jam their flashbulbs into her face. ROGER hovers protectively with COLIN. OLIVIER smiles as he addresses the crowd. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 22A. \nOLIVIER It's my genuine pleasure to introduce a woman who needs no introduction. \n(MORE) \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 23. \nOLIVIER (CONT'D) A great actress on her first trip to London whom I have no doubt... \nREPORTER How do you like being married, Marilyn? \nMARILYN I like it a lot. \nREPORTER Is this third time lucky? \nMARILYN You bet it is. Arthur's the greatest man I ever met. OLIVIER smiles tolerantly, mildly put out at this. MARILYN takes off her sunglasses and blinks. She takes MILLER's arm and looks at him adoringly. He bites down savagely on his unlit pipe. \nREPORTER Marilyn, are you planning to see the sights? \nMARILYN I'd love to see the little fellow with the bow and arrow in Piccadilly Circus. There is a appreciative laughter from reporters. \nREPORTER 2 Is it true you want to be a classical actor now? \nMARILYN I want to be the best actress I can be. \nREPORTER 2 There's a rumour you're going to be in The Brothers Karamazov on Broadway. \nMARILYN I'm considering it. \nREPORTER 3 \n(SHOUTS) Which of them will you be playing? The agenda is clear - Marilyn is the dumb blonde and should act accordingly. But she takes it in her stride, smiling sweetly. \nMARILYN I'll be playing Grushenka. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 24. \nREPORTER 3 Can you spell that? \nMARILYN Sure. Can you? There is laughter at the reporter's expense. \nREPORTER So would you say you're an intellectual now? \nMARILYN My husband is. She looks adoringly at Miller, who smiles vaguely. \nREPORTER 2 What's your definition of an intellectual, Marilyn? \nMARILYN I guess you could look it up in a dictionary. This time the laughter is emphatically on MARILYN's side. One of the reporters turns to VIVIEN. \nREPORTER Vivien, you created the part of Elsie Marina on stage. Do you have any advice for Marilyn? \nVIVIEN I am sure if Miss Monroe needs any advice she'll get it from her director. I hear he's terribly good. The reporters laugh with her and OLIVIER smiles graciously. But as she smiles at him we detect just a flicker of jealous hurt in her eyes. OLIVIER intervenes quickly to continue his prepared speech of welcome. \nOLIVIER In The Sleeping Prince we have discovered the perfect vehicle for Miss Monroe's luminous and justly celebrated talent... He stops as a REPORTER shouts over him. \nJACOBS Marilyn, is it true you wear nothing in bed except Chanel No \nMARILYN As I'm in England let's say I sleep in nothing but Yardley's Lavender. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 25. \nThe press laugh in delight. On the edge of the crowd COLIN watches her, amused and impressed. \nCUT TO: \n41 EXT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. GATES. DAY 41 \nA convoy of cars pass through the throng of JOURNALISTS waiting at the gate. Marilyn's \"secret\" hideaway is no longer much of a secret. The classical old house is elegant and luxurious. \n42 EXT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. FRONT DOOR. DAY. 42 \nOutside the front door MARILYN, MILLER, OLIVIER and VIVIEN have their picture taken by the official PHOTOGRAPHER. ROGER watches unobtrusively. \nVIVIEN Are all your press conferences like that, darling? \nMARILYN Well, that was quieter than some. Vivien smiles at the wry joke. ARTHUR JACOBS watches the proceedings with an eagle eye. \nJACOBS Okay, let's get a snap of the newlyweds. Smile, Arthur. It's not a firing squad. As the group breaks up, MILTON GREENE, handsome and dark- haired, now approaches OLIVIER and COLIN. \nMILTON This is some place you found. He glances at the house. Olivier smiles generously. \nOLIVIER You have my new assistant Colin to thank for that. (Pause, he shepherds COLIN over) This is Milton Greene. You must be very nice to him. He owns half of Marilyn Monroe Productions. \n", "test1_true": "MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 25A. \nOLIVIER Have a cigarette. \nMILTON I don't smoke. If he notices the \"Olivier\" name he doesn't show it. OLIVIER looks mildly put out. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 26. \nOLIVIER Milton - Marilyn and rehearsals. Let's talk. \nMILTON Sure. And the studio wants a new title. OLIVIER escorts Milton away. MILLER and MARILYN are now being photographed on their own. ROGER moves over to JACOBS and murmurs discreetly in his ear. JACOBS nods and moves in to end the session. \nJACOBS The boys at the gate are getting restless. \nMILLER Let's give them two minutes and then we're done. ROGER waves to the POLICEMEN, who open the gates. The PRESS come pouring in like a mob of revolutionaries storming the Bastille. \nCUT TO: \n43 EXT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. FRONT DOOR. DAY. 43 \nCOLIN notices Marilyn grip Miller's hand tightly as the flashbulbs pop all around her. A moment later he is surprised to find VIVIEN at his elbow. \nVIVIEN Marvellous, isn't she? I suppose you're quite smitten. COLIN looks at her shrewdly, sensing he is being tested. \nCOLIN She's all right. A bit common. \nVIVIEN \n(LAUGHS) Larry fell desperately in love with her in New York. He's determined to seduce her. \nCOLIN But she's only been married three weeks. \nVIVIEN Oh, Colin, I thought you were a man of the world. She gives him an arch smile and leans in intimately. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 27. \nVIVIEN (CONT'D) (cont'd) Of course, Larry would never leave me. (Pause) But, if anything were to happen, you would let me know, wouldn't you? \nCOLIN I'm sure he loves you very much. There is a flash of sudden anger in her expression. \nVIVIEN Oh, don't be such a boy! COLIN looks shaken and she touches his hand in contrition. \nVIVIEN (CONT'D) At least you still adore me, don't you? \nCOLIN Of course. Everyone does. There is a wintry bleakness in her face for a second. \nVIVIEN I'm 43, darling. No one will love me for much longer. Not even you. He goes to protest but she stills him with a finger to his lips, her smile quickly restored. \nCUT TO: \n44 EXT. DOG AND DUCK PUB. DAY. 44 \nThe Dog and Duck is a rundown pub in an out of the way lane near the studios. It is a rough, local place utterly devoid of glamour or comfort. COLIN stands outside, staring at it grimly, his bag in his hand. \nCUT TO: \n44A INT. DOG & DUCK PUB. DAY 44A \nA few hard-core LOCALS stand nursing their pints at the bar. One is idly throwing darts. The wallpaper is faded yellow with cigarette smoke, stale sandwiches curl in a display case. COLIN looks around, his heart sinking. BARRY, the landlord looks him up and down, disparagingly. \nCOLIN Colin Clark. I booked a room. BARRY takes a dusty ledger from beneath the bar, spins it around for COLIN to sign. \nBARRY What brings you up this way? \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 27A. \nCOLIN can't help looking a little pleased with himself. \nCOLIN I'm here working on a film. The LOCALS look up from their pints, unimpressed. \nBARRY What film's that? \nCOLIN It's called `The Sleeping Prince'. The darts player, ANDY, doesn't turn. His aim remains steady. \nANDY Sounds lousy. \nBARRY Ignore, Andy - not a film fan - are you, Andy? ANDY doesn't look away from his game. \nANDY Can't be bothered. COLIN tries to impress. \nCOLIN Marilyn Monroe's in it. I'll be working with her. \nBARRY Oh, will you now? The regulars grin unkindly into their pints. ANDY doesn't look away from his game, as he offers laconically: \nANDY The Queen and Prince Philip popped in for a pint earlier. Pity, you just missed them. There are supportive snorts of derision from the LOCALS. COLIN takes it on the chin. BARRY hands him a key. \n", "test1_id": 1800, "test2_input": "COLIN (CONT'D) Really. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 34. \nLUCY \n(SIGHS) I'm free on Saturday. \nORTON \n(OFF) Colin! COLIN ducks into a rack of clothes, making a face at Lucy. She can't help smiling back. \nCUT TO: \n53 EXT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. GATE. DAY. 53 \nFirst light over Pinewood Studios. Although it is August it is chilly so early in the morning. COLIN stands by the gate wearing only his thin summer jacket. He blows on his hands to keep warm. A black car appears. The window winds down and DAME SYBIL THORNDIKE pops her head out. \nSYBIL THORNDIKE How kind of you to meet us. Dear me, you do look cold. \nCOLIN They're ready for you in make-up Dame Sybil. \nSYBIL THORNDIKE How exciting! Don't you love the first day of a new production? \nCOLIN I don't know, Dame Sybil. I've never had one before. DAME SYBIL gazes at him with wistful sadness. \nSYBIL THORNDIKE Oh, to be young again! She blows him a kiss and the car rolls in through the gate. Almost immediately OLIVIER's chauffeur driven Bentley appears. \nOLIVIER Marilyn here yet? \nCOLIN Not yet. \nCUT TO: \n54 EXT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. GATE. DAY. 54 \nCOLIN looks anxiously down the empty road. DAVID ORTON strides towards him angrily. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 35. \nORTON What the fuck's going on? I thought you had a contact in her house. \nCOLIN I do... \nORTON Well bloody use him, then. \nCUT TO: \n55 EXT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. FRONT DOOR. DAY. 55 \nROGER greets COLIN on the doorstep with a grin. \nROGER She hasn't come down yet. Neither has Miller. They're playing trains. COLIN stares at him blankly. \nCUT TO: \n56 INT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM/PRODUCTION 56 \nOFFICE. DAY. COLIN, ROGER and MILTON sit in silence, studiously avoiding each other's eyes. Somewhere upstairs bed springs creek under the pressure of enthusiastic love-making. The phone rings. MILTON nods to COLIN to pick it up. COLIN is glad of the distraction. We hear ORTON's irate tones on the end of the line. \nORTON \n(ON PHONE) Well? What's happening? COLIN glances upstairs as he tries to think what to say. \nCOLIN She's... getting into character. \nCUT TO: \n57 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 57 \nDame Sybil stands alone. \n58 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 58 \nRICHARD WATTIS, ROSAMUND GREENWOOD (MAUD) and TWO FOOTMAN in full costume, sweating under the hot lights. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 36. \nOLIVIER prowls the set smoking impatiently. COLIN is at his side with DAVID ORTON. \nOLIVIER She's kept Dame Sybil Thorndike waiting in full costume for two hours. It's simply not fair. The door finally opens and MARILYN emerges, with PAULA on one side and MILTON on the other. In her figure-hugging shimmering white sheath of a dress she is ravishingly beautiful. Her hair is like a halo of light around her head. No one can take their eyes off her. Slowly, all work on the set stops. MARILYN walks to the set, acutely aware of the scrutiny of the crew. She smiles nervously, then suddenly hesitates, feeling the weight of everyone's attention. Anxiety flits across her face. She whispers something to PAULA and bolts back towards her dressing room. OLIVIER stares after her in shock. \nOLIVIER (CONT'D) What's wrong? \nPAULA She wasn't happy with her make- up. OLIVIER loosens his collar irritably and glances at ORTON. \nOLIVIER Right, Mr. Orton you wanted me to check the back projection. Please join us, Mr. Cardiff. He stalks away, followed by Cardiff and Orton. \n", "test2_true": "59 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 59 \nCOLIN sees SYBIL THORNDIKE standing on set. She beams at him cheerfully. \nSYBIL THORNDIKE Isn't she pretty though? \nCOLIN Would you like to sit down, Dame Sybil? \nSYBIL THORNDIKE How kind of you, Colin. Yes, why don't we all sit down? Colin sees her chair by the camera and goes innocently to fetch it. But as he picks it up he is confronted by a stern looking crew member in overalls. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 37. \nTREVOR Are you a member of NATTKE? \nCOLIN What? \nTREVOR That chair is a prop. Props are NATTKE. If ACT members are going to do NATTKE jobs, I'm calling my men out. Every eye is suddenly on Colin. Taking his shock for stubbornness TREVOR turns to the set and bellows. \nTREVOR (CONT'D) Strike meeting! Half the crew immediately down tools. COLIN looks on in horror. SYBIL THORNDIKE frowns in reproach. \nSYBIL THORNDIKE I'm sure we're all good union members here. There's no need to fall out over something so trivial. \nTREVOR It might be trivial to you, Dame Sybil, but it's my livelihood. He's not in the union. (Pause, to Colin) Put the chair down. COLIN stares at him, frozen. \nTREVOR (CONT'D) Put the chair down now! COLIN drops it as though it was on fire. It clatters to the stage. SYBIL THORNDIKE bears down on TREVOR majestically. \nSYBIL THORNDIKE I rather think you've made your point. Solidarity is the important thing here. When unions fall out, it's only management that benefits. TREVOR pauses, not at all sure about this, but then shrugs magnanimously. \nTREVOR \n(TO COLIN) If I see you doing a NATTKE job again I'll close this set down quicker than you can blink. He turns to one of his men. \nTREVOR (CONT'D) Dave, Dame Sybil needs a chair. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 37A. \nDAVE picks up the same chair, moves it approximately six inches and places it behind SYBIL THORNDIKE, who finally sits down, her sunny good humour instantly restored. \nSYBIL THORNDIKE I was on the picket lines in 1926, you know. \n(MORE) \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 38. SYBIL THORNDIKE (cont'd) Now that was a strike. We were all Bolsheviks then! She smiles nostalgically as ORTON appears to hustle COLIN away, muttering furiously. \nORTON Didn't they teach you anything at Eton? Now fuck off and see if you can get me a bacon sandwich without starting World War III. \nCUT TO: \n60 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 60 \nMARILYN is at last on set and ready to shoot. SYBIL THORNDIKE, as the Queen Dowager, waits behind a door. OLIVIER is in front of the camera with MARILYN, who flutters her hands nervously in an odd calming gesture. PAULA mutters a last few words in her ear, reading her lines to her from her small brown notebook. COLIN watches intently. A bell rings and the red light goes on. The camera operator, DENYS, rolls the camera. \nDENYS Camera running. \nORTON Very quiet, everyone... \nDENYS Speed. The CLAPPER LOADER clicks the clapperboard. \nCLAPPERBOY Twenty two, take one. \nORTON Action! \nOLIVIER (AS REGENT) \"Now, before you meet my mother- in-law I must warn you she is a little vague and can be very deaf... on occasions.\" SYBIL THORNDIKE sweeps through the door right on cue, with MAUD, her lady-in-waiting, following. She is effortlessly in command of her lines. \nSYBIL THORNDIKE (AS QUEEN DOWAGER) \"My dear, such boredom! The decorations hideous, and the music... catastrophe! Our friend, the ex-King of Moravia drove me home. \n(MORE) \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 39. \nSYBIL THORNDIKE (AS QUEEN DOWAGER) \n(CONT'D) He is now called the Duke of Strelitz, he cannot of course go to the Abbey tomorrow, but he is most anxious you should invite him to the room you have taken in the Ritz for Nicky. Maud? \nROSAMUND GREENWOOD (AS MAUD) \"Yes, Ma'am...\" \nSYBIL THORNDIKE (AS QUEEN DOWAGER) \"Oh there you are my dear, I did not see you, give me a glass of that champagne I see over there. Olga Bosnia...\" \nOLIVIER (AS REGENT) \"Might I present Miss Elsie Marina?\" \nSYBIL THORNDIKE (AS QUEEN DOWAGER) \"Oh yes, my dear, of course I remember you well.\" They all look at MARILYN... and nothing happens. \nMARILYN Gee. I forgot my line. I'm sorry. \nOLIVIER Cut. SYBIL THORNDIKE smiles cheerfully. \n", "test2_id": 1801, "test3_input": "OLIVIER (CONT'D) I hear you spent last night with Marilyn. \nCOLIN I didn't spend the night with her. We just had a chat. \nMILTON I heard them chuckling. OLIVIER offers COLIN a lewdly suggestive grin. \nOLIVIER Perhaps if Colin is very diplomatic Marilyn is more likely to behave herself. \nCOLIN She just wants a chum, that's all. \nMILTON A chum? Jesus Christ, what is this, Goodbye Mr. Chips? Grow up, kid. He barges out of the room, slamming the door behind him. OLIVIER checks the effect of his Grand Duke in the mirror and sighs abruptly. \nOLIVIER I thought working with Marilyn would make me feel young again. But I look dead in the rushes. Dead behind the eyes. He gazes at himself thoughtfully. \nOLIVIER (CONT'D) Perhaps I'm angry with her because in my heart I know my own career is in a terrible rut. I wanted to renew myself through her but all I see reflected in that magnificent face is my own inadequacy. He leans back. \nOLIVIER (CONT'D) You know, I admire Marilyn. I really do. Despite her behaviour. She has taken everything Hollywood can throw at her and triumphed. COLIN waits, uncertain why OLIVIER is confiding in him. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 78. \nOLIVIER (CONT'D) An actress has to be pretty tough to get even a tenth as far as she has. He glances up at COLIN in the mirror, shrewd and sympathetic. \nOLIVIER (CONT'D) But be careful, boy. She doesn't need to be rescued. Not really. \nCUT TO: \n106 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 106 \nGossip is always fast to travel but on a film it goes at the speed of light. As COLIN arrives on the set he is greeted with wolf whistles and jeers by RICHARD WATTIS, PAUL HARDWICK and the crew. \nSOUNDMAN What was Marilyn like then, Col? \nHARDWICK Going over her lines with her, were you? \nSOUNDMAN Will she be in today or is she too tired? It is all good-natured stuff but COLIN feels strangely protective, not so much on his own behalf as Marilyn's. \nCOLIN She was just being friendly. \nWATTIS I'll bet. There are hoots of laughter. COLIN retreats to a corner only to find RICHARD WATTIS pursuing him. \nWATTIS (CONT'D) Ever heard of the Venus Fly Trap? There you are, Colin the innocent little fly buzzing about happily, when suddenly a heavenly scent attracts you and - Snap! \nCOLIN Oh, fuck off, Dickie. You've never slept with a woman in your life. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 79. \nWATTIS I know a Femme Fatale when I see one, love. \n107 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 107 \nA brief hiatus in filming. COLIN looks on uneasily as MARILYN, resting against her lean-to, has her costume attended to by LUCY. \nORTON Three minutes, ladies and gents. Three minutes. It has just dawned on COLIN that he has missed his date with LUCY. Before he can react he is jerked violently behind the scenery and pushed up against the wall by an angry MILTON. \nMILTON Arthur Miller called me. He's not happy with you. \nCOLIN He doesn't even know who I am. \nMILTON Marilyn must have said something. \nCOLIN Maybe she was trying to make him jealous... ORTON turns around frowning furiously at the voices behind the set. MILTON pushes COLIN off the set ahead of him. \n108 EXT. STUDIO. DAY. 108 \nMILTON turns bitterly on Colin as soon as they are outside the studio door. \nMILTON Listen, kid, I've known Marilyn for seven years. I fell in love with her, just like you've done. COLIN is about to protest but MILTON ignores him. \nMILTON (CONT'D) We had ten days together and that was it. She picked me up, she put me down. That's what she does. She breaks hearts. She'll break yours. My advice to you is to quit before you get burned. \nCOLIN I don't need your advice. And I'm not in love with her. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 80. \nMILTON Okay, have it your way. (Pause) You don't see Marilyn again, you don't even talk to her. She is completely off-limits to you. Got it? \nCUT TO: \n109 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. CORRIDOR. DAY. 109 \nCOLIN hurries along the corridor, looking for LUCY, who he sees pushing a rack of clothes. He stops awkwardly. She gazes at him meaningfully, hurt and puzzled. \nLUCY I waited for you on Friday. \nCOLIN Oh, God... I'm sorry... I forgot... I've just been so busy. \nLUCY \n", "test3_true": "COLIN \n(SHRUGS) You know how crews gossip. There's nothing in it. \nLUCY Of course there isn't. Marilyn Monroe fancying you? Come on. COLIN is put out. Up to now he has never fully confronted the possibility of Marilyn wanting him, but he doesn't like the idea being dismissed so lightly. Lucy sees it and her eyes widen in surprise and hurt. Before she can respond MARILYN herself coming towards them in her gown, her hair up in towel, surrounded by PAULA and her MAKE-UP people. She offers him a dazzling smile. \nMARILYN Hi, Colin. COLIN smiles, self-conscious. MARILYN stops and frowns, looking at Lucy. \nMARILYN (CONT'D) Hey, are you guys dating? That's what I heard. She looks at him expectantly and suddenly his growing fantasy that she might actually be interested in him kicks in hard. He shrugs casually. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 81. \nCOLIN Of course not. You know how crews like to gossip. His voice trails off lamely as he realises he is repeating what he has just said to Lucy. MARILYN smiles. \nMARILYN Too bad. You look cute together. She walks off with her retinue. There is a long pause. COLIN looks up to see LUCY staring at him in dismay. There are sudden tears in her eyes, which she wipes away angrily. \nLUCY I thought you were different. \nCOLIN Lucy, I really like you. We've had such fun... \nLUCY And now it's time to set your sights a little higher. I get it. (Pause) Who do you think you are, Cary Grant? She shoves the rack of clothes back towards the wardrobe department. Part of him knows he should go after her, but in the end he just stays where he is. He can't help feeling an unworthy sense of relief. \nCUT TO: \n110 INT. DOG AND DUCK PUB. COLIN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. 110 \nCOLIN crosses to the mean little bed on its iron frame and collapses on it gratefully. The noise of the rowdy pub floats up through the floorboards. He covers his ears with his hands then folds the pillow over his head in a desperate attempt to block it out. \nCUT TO: \n111 EXT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. DAY. 111 \nThe studio is quiet at the weekend. COLIN walks along, snatching a moment for a cigarette. As he reaches the doors to the editing suites a battered old Wolsey draws up beside him. ROGER SMITH is at the wheel. \nROGER Get in. COLIN looks at him in confusion. The studio doors open and MILTON emerges. He glances darkly at COLIN and ROGER. \nMILTON Any problem, Roger? \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 82. \nROGER Just dropped by to take Colin out to lunch. COLIN looks surprised. MILTON notices. COLIN stubs out his cigarette and hurries to the passenger door. \nMILTON You're not taking him to Marilyn? That would drop us all in a whole ocean of shit. \nROGER Oh, no, sir. MILTON sees a bulky blanket on the back seat. \nMILTON What do you have in there? \nROGER Just a picnic. We've been looking forward to it, haven't we, Colin? COLIN looks at him, bemused. He gets in quickly. MILTON frowns but shrugs and walks off with a wave. \nMILTON Okay, well, have a nice time boys. Inside the car COLIN looks at ROGER. \nCOLIN Is she okay? In the same moment MARILYN herself erupts from under the blanket in the back. \nMARILYN \nSURPRISE! \nCOLIN Oh, Jesus - She laughs, looking wonderfully naughty. \nMARILYN Roger and I decided to take you out for an adventure. Didn't we Roger? \nROGER \n(PAINED) Indeed we did. \nCOLIN Oh, God. If Milton sees me with you... I'll be sacked... He tries to scramble out but MARILYN hauls him back gleefully. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 83. \nMARILYN No one can sack you, Colin. (Pause) Except me, of course. She pats the seat next to her. \nMARILYN (CONT'D) I don't like being on my own in the back. Before COLIN can respond he sees the curious MILTON running back, having spotted MARILYN in the back. \nMILTON What the hell? He peers into the back window. MARILYN screams and buries herself back under the blanket. COLIN scrambles to get over into the back seat while ROGER stamps on the accelerator and the car roars off. \nMILTON (CONT'D) \n(SHOUTS) Colin! Get back here, you little bastard! You're fired! Do you hear me? Fired! COLIN winces. ROGER looks at him sympathetically. MARILYN emerges from under the blanket, tousled and laughing. \nMARILYN Do you think he saw me? COLIN can't help laughing. He finally tumbles into the back seat with MARILYN as the car speeds away. She scoots up to make room for him. \nMARILYN (CONT'D) Snuggle up. This is fun. She threads her arm through his. He gazes down at their hands meshed together. ROGER's disapproval registers in the faintest flicker of his eyes. In the background the defeated and frustrated MILTON watches the car speed away. \nCUT TO: \n", "test3_id": 1802}

{"train": "MY WEEK WITH MARILYN \nWritten by \nAdrian Hodges \n1 EXT. TILBURY DOCKS. DAY. 1 \nOver a DARK SCREEN we see the caption: \"This is a fairy story, an episode out of time and space, which nevertheless was real\" - Colin Clark. Then, FADE UP ON: Newsreel footage of SIR LAURENCE OLIVIER AND VIVIEN LEIGH arriving back at Tilbury Docks to be greeted by an excited crowd of fans. As they progress down the gangplank and stop to sign autographs we HEAR an excited commentary OVER: \nCOMMENTATOR \"Returning to England are Britain's acting royalty Sir Laurence Olivier and Lady Olivier, better known as stunning Gone With The Wind star Vivien Leigh. Sir Laurence has added a new string to his bow with the announcement that he is to direct and star in a screen version of Terence Rattigan's stage play The Sleeping Prince with none other than Hollywood siren Marilyn Monroe. When the world's greatest actor romances the most famous woman alive, we can be sure that sparks will fly. Now, now Lady Olivier, don't worry - any romance is strictly for the camera!\" As OLIVIER and VIVIEN smile for the photographers, we - \nCUT TO: \n2 EXT. SALTWOOD CASTLE. DAY. 2 \nIt is 1956. Saltwood Castle, the family home of the Clark family, looms over the landscape, framed by the setting sun. It is majestic, an Englishman's dream of a home, complete with turrets and even a moat. There is a feeling of timeless beauty and stability about the scene, something profoundly English. We are a very long way from Hollywood. \nCUT TO: \n3 EXT. SALTWOOD CASTLE. GARDEN. DAY. 3 \nCOLIN CLARK, 23, hurries across the lawn carrying a bag, he is casually dressed, boyish and handsome. He heads towards a beautiful, ramshackle building and through the ancient oak doors. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 2. \n3A INT. SALTWOOD CASTLE. LIBRARY STAIRS. DAY. 3A \nCOLIN bounds up the stairs into the Library. \n3B INT. SALTWOOD CASTLE. LIBRARY. DAY. 3B \nAs COLIN enters, he sees SIR KENNETH CLARK, standing in front of a painting on an easel by the Italian Baroque painter, Annibale Carracci. He has two STUDENTS with him, a man and a woman in their early 20s, and is in mid-description of the painting. \nKENNETH ... and this is one of Carracci's earlier works and one is able to see the emergence of his now famous Baroque style, which is clearly rooted in the tradition of high renaissance and antiquity... COLIN pauses briefly and hurries towards them. Throughout the scene there is a sense of his urgency and desire to go. The whole thing should be played at breakneck pace. KENNETH beams affectionately. \nKENNETH Colin! Come in. Have you met James and Anna? Two very brilliant pupils. He has the avuncular air of a benign academic, affable and a little eccentric. COLIN smiles hurriedly at the students, no time to waste. \nCOLIN I'm leaving for London now, Pa. \nKENNETH Ah, yes. Well, bon chance, dear boy... He puts a friendly arm around COLIN's shoulder and starts to walk him back to the door. \nKENNETH I can always get you a research position at the V&A when you've grown up a bit and got this film idea out of your system... COLIN's smiles but before he can reply JANE CLARK whirls into the room, a ball of energy, talking nineteen to the dozen. \nJANE Kenneth, you might have told Cook we were another two for dinner. What is everyone supposed to eat? Cabbage soup? Oh, Colin, darling, there you are... \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 2A. \nShe looks wonderful in a good quality but elderly dress, eccentrically combined with gardening attire, her mind on a dozen things at once. \nCOLIN I'm off now, Mama. \nJANE Off? \nCOLIN My job interview, remember..? But she is already continuing her journey. COLIN smiles hurriedly at KENNETH, who gives him an affectionate wave as COLIN dashes after his mother. She leaves the Library. \nCUT TO: \n3C INT. SALTWOOD CASTLE. GARDEN. DAY. 3C \nJANE strides across the lawn with COLIN rushing to catch up. \nJANE Can't you stay for dinner? There's nothing to eat but I'm sure the conversation will be charming. \nCOLIN I don't want to be late in the morning. As COLIN hurries after JANE he is nearly run down by an elderly GARDENER with a lawn mower, and has to take lightning evasive action. JANE doesn't notice. \nJANE I'm sure they won't mind. You'll be a famous film director in no time. I know your father's put in a word. \nCOLIN I wish he hadn't done that. I can manage on my own. She stops so abruptly he nearly slams into her. JANE looks around the garden with a frown. \nJANE I have to watch Jenkins like a hawk. One more of his murderous prunings and we'll lose the tea roses for ever. And she's off again, with COLIN still following. He can't help smiling at the madness of it all. \nCUT TO: \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 2B. \n4 EXT. SALTWOOD CASTLE. DRIVEWAY. DAY. 4 \nThe sun is setting, casting a golden glow over the castle. COLIN and JANE emerge from the front door, COLIN pauses in the driveway and dumps his bag in the back of his old but racy MG Sports car. Only now does JANE really turn her attention fully to him for the first time. \nJANE Now go and have a lovely time, darling. We're always here when you're ready to talk your future. COLIN wants to protest but before he can get the words out JANE sees a YOUNG GARDENER walking at the side of the house with a wheel barrow. Her face lights up. \nJANE Mullins! Be an angel - find Cook and ask her how many pork chops we need for tonight. Then bring the car round. I must get to the village before the shop shuts... She dashes away after the GARDENER, turning back as an afterthought to blow a kiss at COLIN as she goes. COLIN smiles, then pauses for a moment to look at the house. We can sense both his affection for it but more pressingly his need to get away. He gets in, puts the car in gear and the Bristol pulls out of the drive and across the moat. In the last rays of the sun, the countryside looks magical, but Colin only has eyes for the road ahead. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 3. \n5 EXT. LONDON STREETS MONTAGE. EVENING 5 \nIt is now nearly 6 o'clock. COLIN sits exactly as he was. PERCEVAL shares a look with VANESSA as he comes out of his office. He gazes drily at Colin. \nPERCEVAL There are no jobs. \nCOLIN I'll come back tomorrow morning. Just in case. \nPERCEVAL It's a free country. He sounds as though he rather regrets it. \n11A EXT. 144 PICCADILLY. LONDON. DAY. (MONTAGE) 11A \nCOLIN arrives early, ready for another day. \n12 INT. 144 PICCADILLY. RECEPTION AREA. DAY. (MONTAGE) 12 \nCOLIN is back in his place at 8.30 sharp the next morning. PERCEVAL gives him a grim stare as he goes through to his office. VANESSA glances up from her typewriter. He meets her eye optimistically but she ignores him. \n13 INT. 144 PICCADILLY. RECEPTION AREA. DAY. 13 \nThe clock ticks around with agonising slowness to 11.00. VANESSA finally gives Colin a pitying look. \nVANESSA Are you going to sit there all day? \nCOLIN If I have to. \nVANESSA You're very determined. \nCOLIN I'd do anything to be in the film business. \nVANESSA Anything? \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 7. \nShe smiles cheekily. He grins back, sensing an opportunity. \nVANESSA You can start by making me a cup of tea. White, two sugars. \nCUT TO: \n14 OMITTED 14 \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 8. \n15 INT. 144 PICCADILLY. RECEPTION AREA. DAY. 15 \nClose on the clock as it ticks around monotonously to 12.30. VANESSA puts on her gloves and collects her bag. She gives COLIN a sly look. \nVANESSA You can answer the telephone while I'm at lunch, if you like. She winks. COLIN grins. The phone rings. He picks it up. \nCOLIN Laurence Olivier Productions... \nCALLER \n(ON PHONE) Is Sir Laurence there? \nCOLIN He's at Notley until the end of the week. Can I take a message? \nCALLER \n(ON PHONE) I'll call back. No sooner has COLIN hung up than PERCEVAL appears. He stares at COLIN. \nCOLIN Vanessa asked me to... \nPERCEVAL Oh, did she? Why didn't you put that call through? \nCOLIN There didn't seem any need to bother you. But if you want me to transfer every single one... PERCEVAL looks at him grudgingly. \nPERCEVAL Use your judgement. He hesitates and looks back. \nPERCEVAL (CONT'D) I need a number for Noel Coward. It won't be in the book, so you'll have to track him down. COLIN realises this is a test. He thinks quickly. \nCUT TO: \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 8A. \n16 INT. SALTWOOD CASTLE. HALL. DAY. 16 \nThe phone rings in the beautiful central hall. JANE CLARK picks up the phone. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 9. \nCOLIN \n(ON PHONE) Hello, Mama. \nJANE Colin, darling! How are you getting on? \nCUT BACK TO: \nThe film shows Marilyn looking sweet and pretty, chatting silently to someone just off camera, mugging playfully in costume, larking about with her hair - and then, when she wants to, turning on her full film star wattage and looking wonderful, every inch the beautiful icon. It is an intimate glimpse of her at work. Colin watches, fascinated, completely forgetting why he's there, still holding the tray - \nPERCEVAL \n(TO CARDIFF) Larry says he particularly likes this dress. She looks radiant. \nCARDIFF Exactly - we need to tone her down a bit. \nPERCEVAL How the hell do you tone down Marilyn Monroe?! COLIN laughs. He immediately regrets it. Both men turn to look at him. PERCEVAL turns off the projector and gazes at him stonily. \nPERCEVAL Marilyn Monroe's publicist is flying in tomorrow. He wants to see the house she'll be staying in. Find something suitable. COLIN nods eagerly, anxious to get out. He is already at the door when PERCEVAL barks at him again. \nPERCEVAL And leave the bloody tea. COLIN had forgotten the tray. He blushes furiously, puts it down and hurries out. \n21 EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. DAY. 21 \nCOLIN has a map spread out on the bonnet of his Bristol sports car. He finds Pinewood Studios then draws a ring around its circumference. He taps his pencil thoughtfully as he lights a cigarette - one of the branded pack that Olivier gave him. He inhales deeply, thinking, then grimaces in distaste, quickly stubbing it out under his foot. \nCUT TO: \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 13. \n22 EXT. TIBBS FARM. DRIVE. DAY. 22 \nCOLIN pulls into the drive of Tibbs Farm, a charming English cottage. \nCUT TO: \n23 EXT. TIBBS FARM. DAY. 23 \nCOTES-PREEDY, the owner, clearly has a very high opinion of Tibbs Farm. Aloof and snobbish, he stands by the front door, looking down his nose at COLIN. \nCOTES-PREEDY Out of the question. I can't have a lot of awful film people tramping through the house in dirty boots. \nCOLIN We'd pay a hundred pounds per week for 18 weeks. \nCOTES-PREEDY My wife would never agree. \nCOLIN That's a pity. I'll have to tell Miss Monroe to look elsewhere, then. COTES-PREEDY double takes. \nCOTES-PREEDY Marilyn Monroe? \nCOLIN \n(NODS) She's making a film with Sir Laurence Olivier. The Sleeping Prince. From the play by Terence Rattigan. \nCOTES-PREEDY I saw it in the West End a couple of years ago. Vivien Leigh was marvellous. \nCOLIN It's Marilyn Monroe in the film. COTES-PREEDY smiles transparently. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 14. \nCOTES-PREEDY (After a second) I suppose I'd have to be introduced..? \nCUT TO: \n24 DELETED 24 \n25 EXT. 144 PICCADILLY. LONDON. DAY. 25 \nARTHUR JACOBS, Marilyn's publicist, is a close-cropped, pugnacious figure in his mid-forties. He waits impatiently outside Olivier's office, a stack of newspapers under his arm. COLIN comes hurrying up, smiling brightly. \nCOLIN Good morning, Mr. Jacobs. I hope you had a pleasant flight. \nJACOBS Where's the fucking car? \nCUT TO: \n26 EXT. COUNTRY LANE. DAY. 26 \nJACOBS sits in the passenger seat of Colin's Bristol sports car reading his stack of newspapers. After a moment he grunts in disgust. \nJACOBS Jeez, do you Brits actually read this stuff? He winds down his window and simply throws the whole lot out into the lane. The pages billow out in a great cloud behind the speeding car, landing in the pretty hedgerows and on neat front lawns. COLIN gapes in astonishment. Welcome to Hollywood. \nCUT TO: \n27 EXT. TIBBS FARM. DAY. 27 \nJACOBS slouches out of the house, magnificently unimpressed. COTES-PREEDY follows him proudly with COLIN at his side. JACOBS takes a long, unimpressed look at the property. \nJACOBS What is this place? A brothel? COTES-PREEDY's face falls. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 14A. \nCOTES-PREEDY It's one of the best houses in the area. \nJACOBS Jesus. And I thought you Brits had taste. \nJACOBS (CONT'D) She's nuts about the Method. \nOLIVIER Stanislavski and the Method are perfectly fine in the rehearsal room but they don't belong on a film set. Time is too tight. I'm sure Marilyn understands. He turns and walks away. JACOBS frowns uncertainly. \nJACOBS Who the hell is this Commie Stan Slavski? \nCUT TO: \n32 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. PRODUCTION OFFICE. DAY. 32 \nCOLIN stands in the Production Office. DAVID ORTON (30s) the First Assistant Director, a thin, fair-haired man regards him with obvious irritation. \nORTON I don't know why Hugh Perceval sent you here. There's nothing I can do for you. \nCOLIN Why not? \nORTON Are you in the union? \nCOLIN No... \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 18. \nORTON Then you can't have a job on the film. \nCOLIN How do I get in the union? \nORTON By getting a job on the film. \nCOLIN But you just said I couldn't have a job on the film unless I was in the union. \nORTON Exactly. It's called a closed shop. COLIN looks at him helplessly. ORTON relents a little. \nORTON (CONT'D) I suppose I might be able to sort something out. The Union owes me a few favours. We haven't got a third yet. \nCOLIN A third? \nORTON Third Assistant Director. (Pause) You do know what the job is? \nCOLIN Assisting the director? \nORTON Christ, no! That's the last thing you do. Lesson One. The third's job is to do whatever the fuck I tell him. ORTON walks to the door, then looks back. \nORTON (CONT'D) \n(SHOUTS) What are you waiting for? COLIN scrambles to follow him out. \nCUT TO: \n33 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. WARDROBE DEPT. DAY. 33 \nAs ORTON and COLIN pass the wardrobe department COLIN notices a pretty WARDROBE GIRL (LUCY) putting costumes on the racks. She has dark hair and laughing eyes and is a year or so younger than him. ORTON follows his gaze. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 18A. \nORTON Colin! COLIN jumps as ORTON glowers at him. \nORTON (CONT'D) Lesson Two. You don't shit on your own doorstep. Got it? \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 19. \nCOLIN Got it. But he sneaks a look back at LUCY as he goes. \n33A EXT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. DAY. 33A \nORTON and COLIN hurry through Pinewood. \nORTON Where are you staying? \nCOLIN My father's place in the Albany. \nORTON You can forget that. Lesson Three. The Third always stays nearby, not in some bloody palace in London. (Pause) Book a room at the Dog And Duck down the road. It's a bit rough but you'll get used to it. He grins, enjoying himself. \nORTON (CONT'D) Now make yourself useful. Marilyn needs a bodyguard. Sort something out. \nCUT TO: \n34 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. PRODUCTION OFFICE. DAY. 34 \nPERCEVAL sits with COLIN and ROGER SMITH. SMITH is a dignified figure in his mid-fifties. His erect bearing speaks of a lifetime in the police. \nPERCEVAL I'm sure you understand the sensitive nature of the job, Superintendant? \nROGER No need for the title. I'm retired from the force. (Pause) Something about looking after a cinema actress? \nPERCEVAL Not just any actress. Marilyn Monroe. He gets no reaction from the stolid ex-policeman. \nROGER I've never had much time for the pictures. \n40 INT. LONDON AIRPORT. HALL. DAY. 40 \nMARILYN sits with MILLER at her side, flanked by OLIVIER and VIVIEN. MARILYN wears a large pair of sunglasses. PHOTOGRAPHERS jam their flashbulbs into her face. ROGER hovers protectively with COLIN. OLIVIER smiles as he addresses the crowd. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 22A. \nOLIVIER It's my genuine pleasure to introduce a woman who needs no introduction. \n(MORE) \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 23. \nOLIVIER (CONT'D) A great actress on her first trip to London whom I have no doubt... \nREPORTER How do you like being married, Marilyn? \nMARILYN I like it a lot. \nREPORTER Is this third time lucky? \nMARILYN You bet it is. Arthur's the greatest man I ever met. OLIVIER smiles tolerantly, mildly put out at this. MARILYN takes off her sunglasses and blinks. She takes MILLER's arm and looks at him adoringly. He bites down savagely on his unlit pipe. \nREPORTER Marilyn, are you planning to see the sights? \nMARILYN I'd love to see the little fellow with the bow and arrow in Piccadilly Circus. There is a appreciative laughter from reporters. \nREPORTER 2 Is it true you want to be a classical actor now? \nMARILYN I want to be the best actress I can be. \nREPORTER 2 There's a rumour you're going to be in The Brothers Karamazov on Broadway. \nMARILYN I'm considering it. \nREPORTER 3 \n(SHOUTS) Which of them will you be playing? The agenda is clear - Marilyn is the dumb blonde and should act accordingly. But she takes it in her stride, smiling sweetly. \nMARILYN I'll be playing Grushenka. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 24. \nREPORTER 3 Can you spell that? \nMARILYN Sure. Can you? There is laughter at the reporter's expense. \nREPORTER So would you say you're an intellectual now? \nMARILYN My husband is. She looks adoringly at Miller, who smiles vaguely. \nREPORTER 2 What's your definition of an intellectual, Marilyn? \nMARILYN I guess you could look it up in a dictionary. This time the laughter is emphatically on MARILYN's side. One of the reporters turns to VIVIEN. \nREPORTER Vivien, you created the part of Elsie Marina on stage. Do you have any advice for Marilyn? \nVIVIEN I am sure if Miss Monroe needs any advice she'll get it from her director. I hear he's terribly good. The reporters laugh with her and OLIVIER smiles graciously. But as she smiles at him we detect just a flicker of jealous hurt in her eyes. OLIVIER intervenes quickly to continue his prepared speech of welcome. \nOLIVIER In The Sleeping Prince we have discovered the perfect vehicle for Miss Monroe's luminous and justly celebrated talent... He stops as a REPORTER shouts over him. \nJACOBS Marilyn, is it true you wear nothing in bed except Chanel No \nMARILYN As I'm in England let's say I sleep in nothing but Yardley's Lavender. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 25. \nThe press laugh in delight. On the edge of the crowd COLIN watches her, amused and impressed. \nCUT TO: \n41 EXT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. GATES. DAY 41 \nA convoy of cars pass through the throng of JOURNALISTS waiting at the gate. Marilyn's \"secret\" hideaway is no longer much of a secret. The classical old house is elegant and luxurious. \n42 EXT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. FRONT DOOR. DAY. 42 \nOutside the front door MARILYN, MILLER, OLIVIER and VIVIEN have their picture taken by the official PHOTOGRAPHER. ROGER watches unobtrusively. \nVIVIEN Are all your press conferences like that, darling? \nMARILYN Well, that was quieter than some. Vivien smiles at the wry joke. ARTHUR JACOBS watches the proceedings with an eagle eye. \nJACOBS Okay, let's get a snap of the newlyweds. Smile, Arthur. It's not a firing squad. As the group breaks up, MILTON GREENE, handsome and dark- haired, now approaches OLIVIER and COLIN. \nMILTON This is some place you found. He glances at the house. Olivier smiles generously. \nOLIVIER You have my new assistant Colin to thank for that. (Pause, he shepherds COLIN over) This is Milton Greene. You must be very nice to him. He owns half of Marilyn Monroe Productions. \nCOLIN (CONT'D) Really. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 34. \nLUCY \n(SIGHS) I'm free on Saturday. \nORTON \n(OFF) Colin! COLIN ducks into a rack of clothes, making a face at Lucy. She can't help smiling back. \nCUT TO: \n53 EXT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. GATE. DAY. 53 \nFirst light over Pinewood Studios. Although it is August it is chilly so early in the morning. COLIN stands by the gate wearing only his thin summer jacket. He blows on his hands to keep warm. A black car appears. The window winds down and DAME SYBIL THORNDIKE pops her head out. \nSYBIL THORNDIKE How kind of you to meet us. Dear me, you do look cold. \nCOLIN They're ready for you in make-up Dame Sybil. \nSYBIL THORNDIKE How exciting! Don't you love the first day of a new production? \nCOLIN I don't know, Dame Sybil. I've never had one before. DAME SYBIL gazes at him with wistful sadness. \nSYBIL THORNDIKE Oh, to be young again! She blows him a kiss and the car rolls in through the gate. Almost immediately OLIVIER's chauffeur driven Bentley appears. \nOLIVIER Marilyn here yet? \nCOLIN Not yet. \nCUT TO: \n54 EXT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. GATE. DAY. 54 \nCOLIN looks anxiously down the empty road. DAVID ORTON strides towards him angrily. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 35. \nORTON What the fuck's going on? I thought you had a contact in her house. \nCOLIN I do... \nORTON Well bloody use him, then. \nCUT TO: \n55 EXT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. FRONT DOOR. DAY. 55 \nROGER greets COLIN on the doorstep with a grin. \nROGER She hasn't come down yet. Neither has Miller. They're playing trains. COLIN stares at him blankly. \nCUT TO: \n56 INT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM/PRODUCTION 56 \nOFFICE. DAY. COLIN, ROGER and MILTON sit in silence, studiously avoiding each other's eyes. Somewhere upstairs bed springs creek under the pressure of enthusiastic love-making. The phone rings. MILTON nods to COLIN to pick it up. COLIN is glad of the distraction. We hear ORTON's irate tones on the end of the line. \nORTON \n(ON PHONE) Well? What's happening? COLIN glances upstairs as he tries to think what to say. \nCOLIN She's... getting into character. \nCUT TO: \n57 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 57 \nDame Sybil stands alone. \n58 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 58 \nRICHARD WATTIS, ROSAMUND GREENWOOD (MAUD) and TWO FOOTMAN in full costume, sweating under the hot lights. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 36. \nOLIVIER prowls the set smoking impatiently. COLIN is at his side with DAVID ORTON. \nOLIVIER She's kept Dame Sybil Thorndike waiting in full costume for two hours. It's simply not fair. The door finally opens and MARILYN emerges, with PAULA on one side and MILTON on the other. In her figure-hugging shimmering white sheath of a dress she is ravishingly beautiful. Her hair is like a halo of light around her head. No one can take their eyes off her. Slowly, all work on the set stops. MARILYN walks to the set, acutely aware of the scrutiny of the crew. She smiles nervously, then suddenly hesitates, feeling the weight of everyone's attention. Anxiety flits across her face. She whispers something to PAULA and bolts back towards her dressing room. OLIVIER stares after her in shock. \nOLIVIER (CONT'D) What's wrong? \nPAULA She wasn't happy with her make- up. OLIVIER loosens his collar irritably and glances at ORTON. \nOLIVIER Right, Mr. Orton you wanted me to check the back projection. Please join us, Mr. Cardiff. He stalks away, followed by Cardiff and Orton. \nSYBIL THORNDIKE It's so easily done, isn't it? I'm sure I went wrong somewhere there too. Shall we have another go, Larry? \nCUT TO: \n61 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 61 \nThe clapperboard snaps. Take Five. \nSYBIL THORNDIKE (AS QUEEN DOWAGER) \"Oh yes, my dear, of course I remember you well.\" \nMARILYN (AS ELSIE) \n(HALTING) \"Oh, I'm quite sure you don't, your royal..., oh, I mean, your, uh, Imperial... your uh... serene majesty.\" It is not clear whether Marilyn's hesitance is acted or not but the others press on gamely. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 40. \nSYBIL THORNDIKE (AS QUEEN DOWAGER) \"What does she say?\" \nOLIVIER (AS REGENT) \"She says she is deeply flattered and compliments you on your wonderful memory.\" MARILYN jumps in, shouting her line over the top of him. \nMARILYN (AS ELSIE) \"I'm in The Coconut Girl at The Avenue.\" There is a pause. SYBIL THORNDIKE hesitates. \nSYBIL THORNDIKE Didn't I have a line somewhere there, dear? \nOLIVIER Cut. \nCUT TO: \n62 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 62 \nThe clapperboard snaps shut again. Take twelve. \nORTON Action! \nSYBIL THORNDIKE (AS QUEEN DOWAGER) \"Thank you, my dear. (Pause) Sweetly pretty. She should use more mascara. When one is young one should use a lot of mascara, and when one is old one should use much more. What do you do, my dear?\" \nMARILYN (AS ELSIE) \"I'm in The Coconut Girl at The Avenue\". \nSYBIL THORNDIKE (AS QUEEN DOWAGER) \n(TO OLIVIER) \"Dear?\" \nOLIVIER (AS REGENT) \"She says she is an actress.\" MARILYN looks at him, hesitant but just about in character. OLIVIER glances at ORTON who nods. \nOLIVIER (CONT'D) Cut it there. \nORTON Check the gate. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 41. \nFOCUS PULLER (After a second) Gate's good. \nOLIVIER Print. There is a near-audible sigh of relief around the set. SYBIL THORNDIKE smiles. \nSYBIL THORNDIKE That was perfect, Marilyn. You're Elsie to the life! MARILYN smiles awkwardly, not really believing her but SYBIL carries on with complete conviction. SYBIL THORNDIKE (cont'd) Perhaps we could practise our lines together later? You'd be doing me such a kindness. At my great age it's just so hard to make them stick! Why don't you come for tea tomorrow? In fact Sybil is word perfect every time, and everyone knows it. But it is a kind and tactful gesture. MARILYN's face lights up. \nMARILYN Can I? \n62A INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 62A \nOLIVIER looks at COLIN in dismay. \nOLIVIER She's impossible. I should have cast Vivien. \nCOLIN If anyone can make her great, it's you. You're a genius. \nOLIVIER Oh, yes. The world's greatest living actor, so they say. OLIVIER looks at him, wanting to be reassured. He fumbles for a cigarette with shaking fingers and COLIN hurries to light it. He smiles wryly. \nOLIVIER (CONT'D) Let's hope I'm as brilliant as you think I am. (Pause) Now be a good boy and keep an eye on her. \nCUT TO: \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 42. \n63 INT. PINEWOOD. DRESSING ROOMS/CORRIDOR. DAY. 63 \nMARILYN and PAULA are heading for the dressing room. MARILYN looks tired and disconnected. COLIN is just behind them on another errand. He can't help overhearing Paula's insistent, honeyed tones as she responds to Marilyn's uncertainty. \nMARILYN I just can't figure this movie out. \nPAULA You were wonderful. You are the most gifted actress I have ever known. You were superb, Marilyn. You were divine. \nMARILYN He was angry with me, I could tell. \nPAULA You were great. You are a great, great actress. All my life I have prayed for a great actress I could help and guide. She stops abruptly and gets down on her knees in the corridor in front of Marilyn. COLIN stops awkwardly, his path blocked. \nPAULA (CONT'D) Like this. I prayed to God on my knees. And he has given me you. You are that great actress, Marilyn. \nLUCY (CONT'D) That's my dad. She gives Colin a swift peck on the cheek as she tidies herself. A moment later the door opens and Lucy's father, MR. ARMSTRONG comes in, wearing his dressing gown over pyjamas. He glances at COLIN with a suspicious smile as he looks at his daughter. \nMR. ARMSTRONG Time to be thinking about bed, darling. Early start tomorrow. \nLUCY Sorry, Daddy. We were just going over tomorrow's schedule. COLIN and LUCY share a small, private smile. He takes his cue and stands up. \nCOLIN Yes, I should be off. Colin Clark. Pleased to meet you, Mr. Armstrong. He offers the surprised MR. ARMSTRONG a confident handshake. \nCOLIN (CONT'D) This is a very nice house you've got. \nMR. ARMSTRONG Do you know this part of the world? \nCOLIN \n(THROWN) Umm... not really. My family are more country people. Lost for words they stare at each other for another moment before MR. ARMSTRONG smiles vaguely then goes. LUCY follows him with a smile at COLIN. He grins and whispers. \nCOLIN (CONT'D) Next Saturday? She nods. He follows her out into the hall. \nCUT TO: \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 46. \n65B EXT. LUCY'S HOUSE. SUBURBS. NIGHT. 65B \nAs he walks down the path, COLIN pauses. He looks around at the uniform semi-detached houses all around him. He is uncomfortable here, so far from the glamorous world of his parents or Pinewood studios. He has a strong sense that he and Lucy are from very different worlds, and walks to his car with an uneasy sense of relief to be getting away. \nCUT TO: \n66 EXT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. GATE. DAY. 66 \nCOLIN is back on the early morning watch. A black car draws up and SYBIL THORNDIKE leans out. \nSYBIL THORNDIKE Colin, dear, I thought you looked cold so I bought you this. She hands him a bright red woollen scarf. COLIN is touched. \nCOLIN Thank you, Dame Sybil. \nSYBIL THORNDIKE Film sets and rehearsal rooms are the coldest places on earth. He smiles as her car drives away. He wraps the scarf around his neck and looks up and down the road again. \nCUT TO: \n67 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 67 \nThe crew stand around in sullen discontent. OLIVIER paces back and forth with MILTON at his side. \nOLIVIER She should be on time, like everyone else. \nMILTON She is a star. \nOLIVIER I'm a fucking star! He looks around in frustration. \nOLIVIER (CONT'D) If we nip this behaviour in the bud perhaps it won't be repeated. \nMILTON This is Marilyn you're talking about. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 47. \nOLIVIER scowls at COLIN, who gives him a cigarette. MARILYN finally emerges with PAULA at her elbow. OLIVIER advances on her, his anger simmering. \nOLIVIER Marilyn, darling you are an angel, and I kiss the hem of your garment, but why can't you get here on time for the love of fuck? \nMARILYN Oh... you have that word in England too? She looks at him in surprise. She looks sedated, not quite there. PAULA leaps protectively to her defence. \nPAULA Marilyn has to prepare properly. She has to find in herself all that lies under the surface. Acting isn't just a case of putting on a costume or some ludicrous false nose. OLIVIER gives her a freezing look then takes Marilyn's hand, leading her forward like a child. \nOLIVIER You must apologise to Dame Sybil. MARILYN reddens with humiliation as he takes her arm. \nCUT TO: \n68 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 68 \nOLIVIER propels MARILYN towards SYBIL THORNDIKE. MARILYN reddens with humiliation. \nMARILYN I'm sorry... \nSYBIL THORNDIKE (Cutting her off) My dear, you mustn't concern yourself. A great actress like you has many other things on her mind. A radiant smile spreads slowly across Marilyn's face as the older woman's words sink in. \nMARILYN You think I'm a great actress? \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 48. \nSYBIL THORNDIKE None of the rest of us truly know how to act for the camera. But you do. It is a rare gift. She looks sharply at OLIVIER. SYBIL THORNDIKE (cont'd) This poor girl hasn't had your years of experience. She is in a strange country, acting a strange part. Now, are you helping or bullying? OLIVIER looks aghast at being so roundly rebuked. COLIN looks on, startled. \nCUT TO: \n69 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. VIEWING THEATRE. DAY. 69 \nOLIVIER, MILTON, PERCEVAL, ORTON and the editor JACK HARRIS watch rushes. COLIN lurks about unnoticed at the back. They watch one of OLIVIER's speeches (from the \" The Coconut Girl\" sequence we saw filming in Scenes 61 and 62). He is dry and clipped, every take precise and professional. It is an effective but theatrical performance. MARILYN sneaks in with ARTHUR MILLER. They sit in the back row watching her performance from the same scene. She fluffs take after take, gets her words wrong and pauses, looking dazed. COLIN notices her clutching MILLER's hand tightly. But finally a good take comes up. She is charming and natural and her performance suddenly makes OLIVIER's look stiff and clumsy. MILLER smiles in relief and reassurance. \n75 INT. LONDON. MARILYN'S CAR. DAY. 75 \nCOLIN sits in the front with ROGER driving. MARILYN, ARTHUR MILLER and MILTON GREENE sit in the back. \nCUT TO: \n76 EXT. LONDON. BOND STREET. DAY. 76 \nIt is very quiet in the normally busy West End. Shops have begun shutting after lunch and the city is rapidly emptying. SHOPPERS wander past, taking little notice of MARILYN who has her hair covered in a scarf and wears dark glasses. MILLER walks at her side, holding her hand. She glances at MILTON with an awkward laugh. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 52. \nMARILYN Gee, it's quiet. \nCOLIN It's Saturday. Early closing. But they're expecting us. She stops to window shop. MILTON lowers his voice to COLIN. \nMILTON No one's recognised her. \nCOLIN At least she can shop in peace. \nMILTON Marilyn's a star. Stars don't even pee alone. He looks around anxiously. But then a PASSER-BY suddenly narrows his eyes and takes a second look. His face lights up and he shouts - \nPASSER-BY It's Marilyn Monroe! MARILYN gives him a radiant smile and within seconds is surrounded by a crowd of SHOPPERS alerted by the fuss. A feverish excitement grows out of nothing as people come running to look, pushing and shoving to see. MARILYN is quickly hemmed in by the heaving mob. To begin with she enjoys it, smiling and posing happily for the cameras that appear out of nowhere. But as the crowd press towards something in the mood of the gathering changes; it becomes wild and over-excited mood as people scream Marilyn's name and shove bits of paper to sign in her face. A WOMAN is pushed to the ground and MARILYN is forced back against the shop window. COLIN sees a flicker of panic on her face. \nROGER My God, she'll be torn apart... \nMILLER Get her out of here. COLIN and ROGER hurl themselves into the crowd doing what they can to keep the excited fans at bay. They manage to force a path to the car, drag the door open and bundle MARILYN and MILLER into the back. MARILYN is pinned against the door and COLIN has to put his arm around her shoulders as he helps her in. He hurls himself into the front, with Milton running alongside the moving car to dive in beside Marilyn. People run alongside, hammering wildly on the windows in violent hysteria. MILTON does his best to put a cheerful gloss on the chaos. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 53. \nMILTON Jeez, Marilyn, they really fucking love you. As COLIN looks in the rear-view mirror he sees MILLER shaking his head in dazed horror as MARILYN slumps half-collapsed into the seat beside him. \nMILLER Madness. Someone's going to get hurt. COLIN shifts his gaze to her in the mirror and his eyes meet Marilyn's. He sees - or imagines - a terrible sadness before she quickly replaces her dark glasses. \nCUT TO: \n77 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 77 \nCOLIN stands silently by the camera, watching MARILYN and RICHARD WATTIS, in character as Elsie Marina and Northbrook, open the doors of the Grand Duke's drawing room. \nMARILYN (AS ELSIE) \"Well we're still the first ones, aren't we? Gee, this is all right, isn't it? OLIVIER looks out from behind the camera, patient and charming. \nOLIVIER Cut. The line is \"Gee, this is all right too, isn't it\". It's a tiny word, my darling, but it matters. Let's go straight away. MARILYN smiles vaguely. HAIR and MAKE-UP rush to do last minute checks. \nDENYS Camera running. \nSOUNDMAN Speed. \nDENYS Mark it. The clapperboard clatters down. Take two. WATTIS and MARILYN come in again on their cue. \nMARILYN (AS ELSIE) \"Well we're still the first ones, aren't we? Gee, this is all right, isn't it?\" \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 54. \nOLIVIER Cut. Nearly there, but Terry did work so very hard on this and we must try to get it right for him. Straight away, please. Take three. \nMARILYN (AS ELSIE) \"Well, we're still the first ones, aren't we? Gee, this is... all right, isn't it?\" By now there is a panic-stricken edge to her voice. \nOLIVIER Cut. \nMARILYN Can't we just drop it? \nOLIVIER The point is that you have already admired the downstairs hall in an earlier scene. Now you are admiring this room as well. \nMARILYN Oh, sure. (Pause, she looks stricken) Paula! OLIVIER looks startled. PAULA comes scurrying across. MARILYN appeals to her, turning away from OLIVIER. \nMARILYN (CONT'D) I don't get it. He's such a strange man. I think she'd figure out he only invited her to sleep with her. \nPAULA \n(TO OLIVIER) The reason Marilyn can't remember the line is because she doesn't believe the situation her character is in. OLIVIER takes out all his pent-up frustration on PAULA. \nOLIVIER Then she should pretend to believe it. PAULA bristles at this insult to her husband's work. \nPAULA Pretend? We're talking about the difference between the truth and artificial crap. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 54A. \nOLIVIER We're in absolute agreement, Paula. Acting is all about sincerity. And if you can fake that, you're off to the races. PAULA only stares at him in disgust. Thoroughly alarmed, MILTON intervenes. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 55. \nMILTON Maybe we should try for another take. \nPAULA Marilyn needs time to give a great performance. You should give her as long as it takes. Chaplin took eight months to make a movie. \nOLIVIER Eight months of this? I'd rather kill myself. Throughout all this MARILYN herself looks lost. COLIN watches her as she feels the crew's irritable collective gaze. Flustered, she flutters her hands in a calming gesture, then goes to the side of the set to lean on a bar put there for her to rest on (her costume is too tight to allow her to sit down). PAULA accompanies her. MARILYN looks up at her in anguish. \nMILTON You have to be patient with her. \nOLIVIER Trying to teach Marilyn how to act is like teaching Urdu to a badger. MILTON gives him a look but says nothing. Instead he picks up his bag and opens it. It is stuffed with bottles of pills. He takes one of them, checks the label and puts it in his pocket. \nMILTON I better go see her. She'll need something to help her calm down. COLIN holds the door for him as he goes out. \nOLIVIER (After a second) Pills to sleep, pills to wake up. Pills to calm her down, pills to give her energy. No wonder she's permanently ten feet underwater. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 59. \nCOLIN looks at him tentatively. \nCOLIN Maybe she's scared. \nOLIVIER We're all scared. It's part of being an actor. \nCOLIN But you have the training to deal with it. OLIVIER turns from the mirror to survey him. \nOLIVIER I wouldn't buy the little girl lost act if I were you. Though heaven knows it's tempting. He sighs wistfully. \nOLIVIER (CONT'D) And I think Marilyn knows exactly what she's doing. COLIN isn't so sure but wisely holds his tongue. \nOLIVIER (CONT'D) You better get over to Parkside and make sure the poor girl's all right. (Pause) And Colin? Don't forget who you work for. \nCUT TO: \n81 EXT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. DRIVE. NIGHT. 81 \nCOLIN draws up outside Marilyn's house. The place is dark and quiet. \nCUT TO: \n82 INT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM NIGHT. 82 \nROGER takes two bottles of beer from the well stocked drinks cabinet and hands one to COLIN, putting a coaster for him on the coffee table. COLIN looks around the opulent drawing room. \nCOLIN Are you sure they won't mind? \nROGER Help yourself. They can spare it. (Pause) Marilyn's okay. She's taken some pills and gone to bed. He frowns darkly. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 60. \nROGER (CONT'D) They like to keep her doped up. It makes her easier to control. \nCOLIN You mean Miller? \nROGER (Shakes his head) The others. They're terrified their cash cow will slip away. He smiles grimly and raises his beer bottle. \nROGER (CONT'D) Cheers! \nCUT TO: \n83 INT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM. NIGHT. 83 \nCOLIN wakes abruptly from a doze as his empty bottle of beer rolls to the floor. ROGER is fast asleep. COLIN glances at the clock. It is nearly midnight. \nCUT TO: \n84 INT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. UPSTAIRS HALL. NIGHT. 84 \nCOLIN, a little drunk, creeps out of the toilet. The narrow strip of light from the door disappears, leaving the hall in darkness. COLIN inches forward uncertainly. He stops, waiting for his eyes to adjust. The house is totally silent. Then, just as he is about to move, he hears something. Breathing, very close by. Faint but unmistakable. Shallow breaths, like sighs. COLIN is paralysed. A beat, then - A door is flung open along the hall and light floods into the corridor. MARILYN is sitting on the carpet leaning against the wall only a few feet away from Colin. She is wrapped in a pink bed-cover and stares directly at him, her expression blank and sedated. By her side is an open spiral bound notebook, its pages closely crammed with handwriting. \nMILLER \n(OFF) Marilyn. Come back to bed. It's not what you think. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 61. \nShe stares at COLIN. It is not even clear she knows he is there. COLIN gazes back at her, paralysed. MILLER's voice comes again, flat and tired. \nMILLER (CONT'D) \n(OFF) It's just a few ideas. Writer's stuff. (Pause) Bring back my book and let's get some sleep. Finally MARILYN stirs and closes the notebook. Holding it to her breast and clutching the cover around her shoulders she gets up and goes into the bedroom, closing the door. As the light snaps off COLIN breathes for the first time in what feels like minutes. \nCUT TO: \n85 EXT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. GATE. DAY. 85 \nCOLIN, muffled in his scarf, looks up as Marilyn's car cruises to a halt at the gate. \nCOLIN Good morning, Miss Monroe. She is hunched in the back, her hair in a scarf, her face protected by her large sunglasses with PAULA by her side. She doesn't look up. \nCUT TO: \n86 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUNDSTAGE. DAY. 86 \nOLIVIER, DAVID ORTON and COLIN huddle around the camera. JEREMY SPENSER and TECHNICIANS stand around, bored and listless. MILTON appears. They speak in low, urgent tones. \nOLIVIER Well? What did she want? \nCOLIN She wants to see me. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 71. \nHe shrugs awkwardly. MILTON looks at OLIVIER in panic. \nMILTON He shouldn't be talking to her. He's just a kid. Supposing he says something? (Pause) Why the hell didn't she call me? His angry - and jealous - frustration is in stark contrast to OLIVIER, who looks at COLIN with a new interest, wondering if there is anything in this odd situation that can work to his advantage. He smiles calmly. \nOLIVIER I'm sure Colin knows what he's doing. Don't you, Colin? There is a warning as well as approval in his tone. \nCUT TO: \n97 INT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM. DAY. 97 \nROGER leads COLIN into the formal drawing room. \nROGER Miss Monroe said for you to wait. She won't be long. He looks at COLIN dubiously as he goes out. COLIN is nervous and not quite sure what to do with himself. He looks at the drinks in their decanters on the sideboard and is suddenly desperate for some Dutch courage. He finds the brandy and picks it up - \nMARILYN \n(OFF) Help yourself to a drink. COLIN wheels in surprise. MARILYN stands in the doorway, casually but beautifully dressed in silk trousers and a pale cream shirt. COLIN looks guiltily at the brandy. \nCOLIN I was just... checking you've got everything you need. She walks to the sideboard, standing only a few inches away from him. He can't take his eyes from hers. He drops his gaze, only to find himself staring at her breasts. He looks up again sharply but not before she notices. She takes the decanter from his hand. \nMARILYN Here, let me. She pours some brandy into a glass and gives it to him. \nMARILYN (CONT'D) Are you frightened of me, Colin? \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 72. \nCOLIN No. \nMARILYN Good. Because I like you. Colin doesn't know what to say. MARILYN gazes at him. \nMARILYN (CONT'D) I want you to help me. Will you do that? She looks at him, her eyes wide. COLIN feels himself sinking into her gaze. \nCOLIN I'm only the third. Just a messenger, really. \nMARILYN But you know what's going on. You can see both sides of the situation. He shrugs in helpless agreement. \nMARILYN (CONT'D) I want you to be honest. Tell me everything. She indicates a chair and COLIN perches on it awkwardly. \nMARILYN (CONT'D) Relax. I thought you weren't scared of me. (Pause) Are you hungry? I'll have them send in a tray. I'm starved. He doesn't know how to reply and Marilyn misreads his silence. Her eyes widen in dismay. \nMARILYN (CONT'D) Oh, gee, I'm sorry. Am I interrupting something? Maybe you have a Mrs. Colin waiting for you at home? \nCOLIN There's no Mrs. Colin. \nMARILYN So we can talk as long as we like? He nods uncertainly. She frowns. \nMARILYN (CONT'D) Why is Sir Olivier so mean? He talks to me as if he's slumming. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 73. \nCOLIN hesitates then decides to throw caution to the wind. \nCOLIN I'll tell you what's wrong. It's agony for him because he's a great actor who wants to be a film star, and agony for you because you're a film star who wants to be a great actress. And this film won't help either of you. He stops, breathless, knowing he has gone to far. She stares at him, wide-eyed with surprise. Horribly self- conscious he takes a too large swig of his brandy, reddens and coughs. She laughs. \nMARILYN Are you sure you can handle that? You don't look old enough to drink. \nCOLIN I'm 23, Miss Monroe. \nMARILYN It's Marilyn. (Pause) I'm 30. I guess that makes me an old lady to you. \nCOLIN Seven years is nothing. She smiles then sits opposite him. \nMARILYN Do you know I've been married three times already? How did that happen? \nCOLIN You were just looking for the right man. \nMARILYN They always look right at the start. She smiles wistfully. Her presence is overwhelming. The silence stretches for a second, pregnant with strange possibilities. Suddenly the phone rings, making him jump. Automatically he picks it up. \nCOLIN Hello? \nCUT TO: \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 74. \n98 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. PRODUCTION OFFICE. DAY. 98 \nMILTON sits at his desk. He leans forward anxiously at the sound of Colin's voice. \nMILTON Colin? Is everything okay? What did she want? \nCUT BACK TO: \nOLIVIER (CONT'D) I hear you spent last night with Marilyn. \nCOLIN I didn't spend the night with her. We just had a chat. \nMILTON I heard them chuckling. OLIVIER offers COLIN a lewdly suggestive grin. \nOLIVIER Perhaps if Colin is very diplomatic Marilyn is more likely to behave herself. \nCOLIN She just wants a chum, that's all. \nMILTON A chum? Jesus Christ, what is this, Goodbye Mr. Chips? Grow up, kid. He barges out of the room, slamming the door behind him. OLIVIER checks the effect of his Grand Duke in the mirror and sighs abruptly. \nOLIVIER I thought working with Marilyn would make me feel young again. But I look dead in the rushes. Dead behind the eyes. He gazes at himself thoughtfully. \nOLIVIER (CONT'D) Perhaps I'm angry with her because in my heart I know my own career is in a terrible rut. I wanted to renew myself through her but all I see reflected in that magnificent face is my own inadequacy. He leans back. \nOLIVIER (CONT'D) You know, I admire Marilyn. I really do. Despite her behaviour. She has taken everything Hollywood can throw at her and triumphed. COLIN waits, uncertain why OLIVIER is confiding in him. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 78. \nOLIVIER (CONT'D) An actress has to be pretty tough to get even a tenth as far as she has. He glances up at COLIN in the mirror, shrewd and sympathetic. \nOLIVIER (CONT'D) But be careful, boy. She doesn't need to be rescued. Not really. \nCUT TO: \n106 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 106 \nGossip is always fast to travel but on a film it goes at the speed of light. As COLIN arrives on the set he is greeted with wolf whistles and jeers by RICHARD WATTIS, PAUL HARDWICK and the crew. \nSOUNDMAN What was Marilyn like then, Col? \nHARDWICK Going over her lines with her, were you? \nSOUNDMAN Will she be in today or is she too tired? It is all good-natured stuff but COLIN feels strangely protective, not so much on his own behalf as Marilyn's. \nCOLIN She was just being friendly. \nWATTIS I'll bet. There are hoots of laughter. COLIN retreats to a corner only to find RICHARD WATTIS pursuing him. \nWATTIS (CONT'D) Ever heard of the Venus Fly Trap? There you are, Colin the innocent little fly buzzing about happily, when suddenly a heavenly scent attracts you and - Snap! \nCOLIN Oh, fuck off, Dickie. You've never slept with a woman in your life. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 79. \nWATTIS I know a Femme Fatale when I see one, love. \n107 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 107 \nA brief hiatus in filming. COLIN looks on uneasily as MARILYN, resting against her lean-to, has her costume attended to by LUCY. \nORTON Three minutes, ladies and gents. Three minutes. It has just dawned on COLIN that he has missed his date with LUCY. Before he can react he is jerked violently behind the scenery and pushed up against the wall by an angry MILTON. \nMILTON Arthur Miller called me. He's not happy with you. \nCOLIN He doesn't even know who I am. \nMILTON Marilyn must have said something. \nCOLIN Maybe she was trying to make him jealous... ORTON turns around frowning furiously at the voices behind the set. MILTON pushes COLIN off the set ahead of him. \n108 EXT. STUDIO. DAY. 108 \nMILTON turns bitterly on Colin as soon as they are outside the studio door. \nMILTON Listen, kid, I've known Marilyn for seven years. I fell in love with her, just like you've done. COLIN is about to protest but MILTON ignores him. \nMILTON (CONT'D) We had ten days together and that was it. She picked me up, she put me down. That's what she does. She breaks hearts. She'll break yours. My advice to you is to quit before you get burned. \nCOLIN I don't need your advice. And I'm not in love with her. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 80. \nMILTON Okay, have it your way. (Pause) You don't see Marilyn again, you don't even talk to her. She is completely off-limits to you. Got it? \nCUT TO: \n109 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. CORRIDOR. DAY. 109 \nCOLIN hurries along the corridor, looking for LUCY, who he sees pushing a rack of clothes. He stops awkwardly. She gazes at him meaningfully, hurt and puzzled. \nLUCY I waited for you on Friday. \nCOLIN Oh, God... I'm sorry... I forgot... I've just been so busy. \nLUCY \nCOLIN and an astonished MARILYN walk through the school buildings with ROGER a discreet distance behind them. \nMARILYN This isn't a school, it's a palace! COLIN smiles. \nCOLIN Eton is 500 years old. It was founded by King Henry VI. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 89A. \nMARILYN It's like walking through history. \nCOLIN Take that room up there. They stop as COLIN points up at a window. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 90. \nCOLIN That's where the boys were sent if they didn't work hard enough. Where we were whipped. MARILYN looks at him in shock. \nMARILYN Whipped? \nCOLIN Beaten. She looks appalled. \nMARILYN I'd never send my kids away. (pause) How long were you here? \nCOLIN Five years. But I was sent to boarding school when I was eight. \nMARILYN Why? \nCOLIN That's what we do in my family. She smiles at this, looking at him shrewdly. \nMARILYN It seems to me that you've had most things pretty easy. \nCOLIN In one way, yes. But when you're brought up in a house of over- achievers, it's hard to make your own mark. She looks at him, sympathetic but pushing a little harder. \nMARILYN So how are you going to do it? \nCOLIN Maybe it will be in films, but if not, there are so many possibilities out there. \nMARILYN Sounds pretty good to me. She smiles warmly, liking him a lot more for his openness. We sense their relationship has moved quietly to a different and deeper level. But before either of them can say anything a SCHOOLBOY turns the corner in his Eton uniform. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 90A. \nHe looks up at MARILYN, his mouth hanging open in shock. Then he simply turns and runs, shouting at the top of his voice. \nSCHOOLBOY Marilyn! It's Marilyn Monroe! \nCUT TO: \n121 EXT. ETON COLLEGE. COURTYARD. DAY. 121 \nMARILYN and COLIN are swamped in a joyous mass of Eton students. MARILYN smiles, waves, pouts, even kisses one boy on the cheek. Cheering BOYS hang out of every window. MARILYN blows kisses to them all. ROGER has to plunge into the crowd to rescue her. COLIN follows after them with difficulty. MARILYN pauses, jumping on a bench to wave goodbye and blow more kisses to the boys. \nMARILYN Work hard, boys! I don't want anyone whipping you! A gawky young teenager near the front shouts out cheekily. \nBOY You can whip me anytime, Marilyn! MARILYN laughs in delight. There are cheers as COLIN escorts her away. \nCUT TO: \n122 EXT. THAMES RIVERBANK. DAY. 122 \nROGER leans back against the car, smoking calmly. \nCUT TO: \n123 EXT. THAMES RIVERBANK. DAY. 123 \nAfter the riotous excitement of the Eton schoolyard the peace and quiet of the river. MARILYN rushes along the sandy bank. The water glitters magically. \nMARILYN Hurry up, slow poke. \nCOLIN But we haven't got any... He stops in mid-sentence as he sees MARILYN unbuttoning her blouse and throwing it off carelessly. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 91. \nHe tears his eyes away from her as she casually strips her clothes off. He hurries to find a bush to get changed behind. As he ducks down behind it he hears a splash and MARILYN's cry of shock as she hits the water. \nMARILYN Oh my gosh! It's freezing! \nCUT TO: \n124 EXT. THAMES. DAY. 124 \nMARILYN swims in the water, humming softly to herself. COLIN wades in, wincing at the cold. She laughs. \nMARILYN This is great. \nCOLIN What if a boat goes past? We could be arrested. \nMARILYN Don't worry. Roger will fix it. Oh, darn it... She holds her head and he looks at her with concern. \nMILTON is waiting for COLIN at the door. \nMILTON Marilyn's not well. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 95. \nCOLIN But she was wonderful yesterday. MILTON looks at him for a long moment, masking his hostility in barbed politeness. \nMILTON I don't know what you did to her, kid, but she got nervous. I had to give her some pills to calm her down. \nCOLIN She doesn't need pills! She just needs someone to care for her. \nMILTON Someone like you? COLIN reddens. MILTON shakes his head patronisingly. \nCOLIN I told you, I'm not in love with her! \nMILTON You kissed her. \nCOLIN She said that? \nMILTON Spare me the bullshit. I know everything. COLIN stares at him, feeling hopelessly out of his depth. \nMILTON (CONT'D) You messed her up, kid. Confused her. He comes very close, his tone fierce but wounded. \nMILTON (CONT'D) I've got every penny I ever made tied up in Marilyn. She owes me. If it wasn't for me she'd still be on contracts that make slave wages look good. I gave her back her freedom, and now Miller's turning her against me. That's what you get for trying to help Marilyn Monroe. He goes back to the house, pausing at the door, speaking more in sorrow than anger. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 96. \nMILTON (CONT'D) If you want to play with the grown-ups, Colin, start learning the rules. \nCUT TO: \n129 INT. PUB. COLIN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. 129 \nA gentle summer breeze lifts the net curtains. COLIN is fast asleep. There's a sharp rap at the door. \nROGER \n(OFF) Colin! (Pause) Colin! COLIN opens his eyes, his mind drugged with sleep. \nCOLIN Roger? What's the matter? \nROGER \n(OFF) It's Marilyn. A cold dread clutches at COLIN's stomach. He stumbles out of bed and opens the door. ROGER stands in the doorway \nCOLIN Is she dead? \nROGER She's asking for you. She's sick. I think she might be in a coma. \nCOLIN How can she be asking for me if she's in a coma? \nROGER Just bloody get dressed! \nCUT TO: \n130 EXT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. DRIVE. NIGHT. 130 \nROGER and COLIN drive up. MILTON, waits on the steps. He looks resentfully at COLIN but doesn't say anything. \nCUT TO: \n131 INT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. MARILYN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. 131 \nPAULA STRASBERG paces frantically outside Marilyn's bedroom door as ROGER, MILTON and COLIN hurry up the stairs. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 97. \nPAULA She hasn't made a sound for over an hour. \nROGER We should break down the door. \nCOLIN How many pills did she take? \nMILTON Oh, Jesus, who knows? I wasn't counting. COLIN knocks gently. \nCOLIN Marilyn? There is no reply. \nCUT TO: \n132 EXT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. GARDEN. NIGHT. 132 \nROGER and COLIN carry a ladder across the moonlit gravel and prop it up against the wall. \nROGER That's her window. He points with his torch. The window is open. COLIN shins up the ladder while ROGER holds it. \nCOLIN I'll open the door once I'm inside. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 101. \nCOLIN Writers scribble all kinds of things. It doesn't mean anything. She looks at him, her eyes full of pain. \nMARILYN He wanted me to find it. It said he should never have married me. That I was unpredictable and a woman-child, flighty and self- centred. He's left me, Colin. Why do the people I love always leave me? She looks so wretched, so completely baffled, that COLIN responds with sudden passion. \nCOLIN I'll never leave you. She smiles and embraces him gratefully. She sighs. \nMARILYN All people ever see is Marilyn Monroe. As soon as they realise I'm not her, they run. He lies down next to her, taking her awkwardly in his arms. She sighs sleepily. \nMARILYN (CONT'D) Boy, there's a lot of men in this business. And they all think you've got to sleep with them. She looks across at him, their faces inches apart. \nMARILYN (CONT'D) You're not like that. That's why I like you. COLIN stares back at her guiltily. She smiles. \nMARILYN (CONT'D) You should date that Wardrobe lady. She's pretty. \nCOLIN I don't want to. (Pause) I love you, Marilyn. She stares at him and tears gather in her eyes again. They stare intently at each other, their mood fragile, touched with both sensuality and a longing for something less tangible. MARILYN leans forward and kisses him gently. The embrace grows in passion and they kiss properly, hungrily. He kisses her eyes and her face and she sighs happily. He wants her more than he has wanted anything before. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 102. \nAnd then he stops. The fantasy he has been pursuing for weeks is within his grasp but he knows that whatever it does for him it will only damage her further. He pulls away from her gently. Her eyes flicker open lazily. \nMARILYN What's the matter? Don't you want to make love? \nCOLIN Maybe we should just be friends. \nMARILYN Okay. Friends. She wraps herself around him, curling up so their bodies cradle each other like spoons in a cutlery draw. As she buries her head in his neck he feels her breasts against his back. She curls against him. \nMARILYN (CONT'D) This is nice. Like spoons. I used to do this with Johnny. \nCOLIN Who's Johnny? \nMARILYN Johnny Hyde. My agent, back in the old days. He was thin, like you... Her voice is blurred and drifting with sleep. With her body warm against him COLIN's resolve nearly snaps but he is clear eyed now and determined. \nCOLIN Marilyn? She mutters softly in reply. \nCOLIN (CONT'D) Do one thing for me? Come into the studio on time tomorrow and show everybody what you can do. Show Larry you're a great actress. \nMARILYN \n(BLURRED) Okay. He smiles and turns out the light. \nCUT TO: \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 103. \n135 INT. PARKSIDE. MARILYN'S BEDROOM/BATHROOM. DAY. 135 \nFirst light streams in through the curtains. COLIN wakes to hear Marilyn singing cheerfully. He gets up and sees her through the open door of the bathroom sitting in the bath, her back towards him. She is practicing the gentle waltz tune she is to sing in the film. \nMARILYN \"I found a dream and lay in your arms the whole night through... I'm yours no matter what others may say or do... She has never sounded so happy or carefree. COLIN smiles. \nCUT TO: \n136 EXT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. GATE. DAY. 136 \nCOLIN races up the road and arrives panting at the gate a few seconds before OLIVIER's car swings into the entrance. The great man leans out of the back window. \nOLIVIER Morning, boy. (Pause) Christ, you look rough. He looks at him thoughtfully, then shrugs. \nOLIVIER (CONT'D) Let me know when Marilyn arrives. If she ever does. \nCOLIN Oh, I'm pretty sure she'll be in this morning. OLIVIER gives COLIN an odd look. \nCUT TO: \n137 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 137 \nMARILYN, OLIVIER and WATTIS act a scene together; a drunken Elsie Marina is being seduced by the Grand Duke, and Northbrook bursts in to interrupt them as a VALET plays the violin in the doorway behind him. \nWATTIS (AS NORTHBROOK) \"Your Grand Ducal Highness..\" \nOLIVIER (AS REGENT) \"This is intolerable\"! \nWATTIS (AS NORTHBROOK) \"With the deepest respect, sir, my message was so important I had no choice but to intrude\". \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 104. \nOLIVIER (AS REGENT) \"Revolution?\" \nWATTIS (AS NORTHBROOK) \"No, sir, Miss Marina's aunt has been in a motor accident. The hospital is calling for her most urgently.\" \nMARILYN (AS ELSIE) \"What? (Giggles drunkenly) Oh, go away, you silly man.\" \nWATTIS (AS NORTHBROOK) \"Miss Marina, your aunt... you realise how serious her condition is?\" \nMARILYN (AS ELSIE) \"Well, it's her own fault. She has no right being out at this time of night. She's 93!\" MARILYN is utterly adorable. The crew, COLIN, amongst them, can't take their eyes off her. OLIVIER glances at ORTON behind the camera. They have a good take and they know it. \nCOLIN I haven't done anything. She's just... got a stomach ache. He reddens with embarrassment. ROGER coughs. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 108. \nROGER I think he means her monthlies. \nPAULA What will Arthur say if she dies? \nCOLIN She's not dying, for Christ's sake. The HOUSEKEEPER now appears at the door with an elderly man at her side. He nods briskly. \nCONNELL I'm Dr. Connell. Is the patient in there? \nPAULA Please save her... it's Marilyn Monroe. You can't let her die. CONNELL calmly extracts himself from her grasp. \nCONNELL Perhaps you'd all like to give us a little privacy? As COLIN shepherds the others out MILTON turns on him bitterly. \nMILTON Happy now, kid? \nCUT TO: \n143 INT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. HALL. NIGHT. 143 \nDR. CONNELL stands in the hall outside the bedroom writing out a prescription and smoking a cigarette. He tears the prescription off the pad and looks up. \nCONNELL Who's in charge here? MILTON, PAULA, ROGER and COLIN all step forward as one. CONNELL gives them a wry look and shrugs. \nCONNELL (CONT'D) I've given Mrs. Miller an injection and the bleeding has stopped. She needs to stay in bed tomorrow but after that she'll be fine. I suggest someone stays with her. PAULA leans forward and almost snatches the prescription from his hand. \nPAULA She'll be safe with me. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 109. \nShe looks bitterly at Colin. \nCUT TO: \n144 EXT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. NIGHT. 144 \nCOLIN walks CONNELL to his car, their feet crunching on the gravel. \nCONNELL Well, goodnight then. COLIN holds the door open as he gets in. \nCOLIN Was she really pregnant? \nCONNELL I think that's a private matter between Mr and Mrs. Miller. He looks at COLIN with cool disapproval, then closes the door and drives off. COLIN stands watching, shivering in his shirtsleeves. \nCUT TO: \n145 INT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. MARILYN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. 145 \nCOLIN creeps into the room and sits on the bed. MARILYN is awake. She gazes at him, hazy but lucid. \nMARILYN We have to say goodbye now, Colin. Arthur's on his way back. When this film is over I'm going to settle down and be a good wife to him. I'm going to learn to make Matzo ball soup as good as his dad's. She smiles wistfully at the fantasy. \nMARILYN (CONT'D) We have to forget this ever happened. \nCOLIN I don't want to forget. He struggles then suddenly bursts out passionately. \nCOLIN (CONT'D) Let me protect you from all this... She smiles sadly. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 110. \nMARILYN What do you want to do? Marry me? \nCOLIN Why not? You could come and live at my parents place. You'd love it. It's a castle, like in a fairy tale. We wouldn't even have to live together. You could have your own suite of rooms... He is close to tears, suddenly looking very young. She looks at him with a sad, sweet smile. He shakes his head stubbornly, taking her hand in passionate appeal. \nCOLIN (CONT'D) You could quit. Forget Marilyn Monroe, forget Hollywood. Let it all go. \nMARILYN This is what I've worked for my whole life. I couldn't just give it all up. \nCOLIN Why not, when it drives you crazy? Her eyes widen in surprise. A flicker of nervous insecurity dulls her expression. \nMARILYN You think I'm crazy? \nCOLIN I didn't mean that. I just meant you could be happy. \nMARILYN I am happy. I got everything I ever dreamed about. She smiles tentatively, but he sees a terrible fear in her eyes. He looks down, realising with a cruel stab of pain that Olivier was right. There is no way back. She doesn't want to be rescued. He finally looks up, smiling despite the tears in his eyes. \nCOLIN Of course you're happy. (Pause) You're a star. The biggest star in the world. She smiles, reassured. He drags himself off the bed and goes to the door, pausing for a second as he looks back. \nCOLIN (CONT'D) You're right, Marilyn. We have to forget all this. \n(MORE) \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 111- \nCOLIN (CONT'D) From now on I'm nobody. Just the third. You don't even know I exist. We'll never look at each other again. She giggles with some of her old playfulness. \n150A INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. WARDROBE DEPT. DAY. 150A \nThe wardrobe department is empty except for LUCY, who cradles her own gift from Marilyn. COLIN comes in, looking nervous. They look at each other awkwardly. \nCOLIN Aren't you going to throw yours away? \nLUCY Of course not. It's from Marilyn Monroe. He smiles. She shrugs and turns to leave. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 115. \nCOLIN (After a second) Lucy? She turns back to look at him. \nCOLIN (CONT'D) I was wondering if you're doing anything this Saturday. \nLUCY I'm washing my hair. He nods, accepting this as no more than he deserves. She goes but then stops to look back at him. \nLUCY (CONT'D) Did she break your heart? \nCOLIN (After a second) A little. \nLUCY Good. It needed breaking. There is no malice in her response, just an awareness that he is older and wiser now, and perhaps a better man for the experience. He nods, accepting the rebuke. \nLUCY (CONT'D) (After a second) I might be free on Wednesday. COLIN smiles. She goes out. He looks down at Marilyn's present in his hands. \nCUT TO: \n151 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. HALL. DAY. 151 \nCOLIN walks down the hall. He notices the red light is on outside the viewing theatre. As he goes towards it he sees ROGER coming the other way on his way out of the studio, his job done. The two men smile; an acknowledgment of everything they've been through together. ROGER offers him a friendly salute and then goes on his way. \n152 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. VIEWING THEATRE. DAY. 152 \nOLIVIER sits on his own, watching an edited version of the \"The Coconut Girl\" sequence (Scenes 61 and 62). COLIN comes in. OLIVIER glances at him. \nOLIVIER \"You do look, my son, in a moved sort/As if you were dismay'd: be cheerful, sir./Our revels now are ended. \n(MORE) \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 116. \nOLIVIER (CONT'D) These our actors,/As I foretold you, were all spirits and/Are melted into air, into thin air... \nCOLIN Prospero. \nOLIVIER \n(SMILES) We are such stuff/As dreams are made on, and our little life/Is rounded with a sleep...\" COLIN sits down next to the great man. They watch in silence as another sequence is projected for them. The sequence shows MARILYN improvising in the champagne and caviar scene. She serves herself food and drink before collapsing, drunk. The endless retakes and fluffs gone, what remains is a gifted comic performance by a luminous beauty. \nOLIVIER (CONT'D) (After a second) She's quite wonderful. No training, no craft, no guile, just pure instinct. Astonishing. He seems almost lost in awe. COLIN gazes at him in surprise. \nCOLIN You should tell her that. \nOLIVIER Oh, I will. But she won't believe me. That's probably what makes her great. It's certainly what makes her so profoundly unhappy. He smiles wryly. \nOLIVIER (CONT'D) I tried my best to change her, but she remains brilliant despite me. (Pause) Directing a movie has to be just about the best job ever invented, but Marilyn has cured me of ever wanting to do it again. He signals to the projection box and the film stops as the lights come up. \nOLIVIER (CONT'D) And now I'm going back to the theatre. John Osborne is writing a piece for me. \nCOLIN I thought you hated all that Royal Court stuff. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 117. \nOLIVIER \n(SMILES) Miller made me see things differently. (Pause) You have to find new worlds to conquer, if you want to be the best. And believe me, most of the time, I really am the best. He goes to the door and pauses. \nOLIVIER (CONT'D) You've done a good job, boy. (Pause) Welcome to the circus. He goes out. COLIN looks back up at the projection box. \nCOLIN Run it again, please. The lights go down. MARILYN's face appears on the screen, laughing and happy. It is another sequence, the one where Marilyn does her sweet, uninhibited little dance (Scene 90), a performance both sexy and yet touchingly innocent. HOLD on COLIN for a long moment, gazing at her image in the darkness, then - \n152A INT. DOG AND DUCK PUB. DAY 152A \nThe circus is leaving. The film is shutting down. Not knowing his next job COLIN sits, suitcase next to his chair, wearing the 'Marilyn' experience on his face and in his soul. Head down, sipping a pint. He could be a regular here. BARRY behind the bar, flitting around - the dart players and regulars at play. And then, as if a gust of wind invaded, BARRY looks up and freezes. The DART PLAYER, sensing something, turns to look up as well. The regulars are frozen in mid-action. COLIN is missing it all. 100% of his attention is given to his woe and his pint. \nMARILYN Buy a girl a drink? COLIN doesn't turn. He recognizes the voice and smiles. \nCOLIN Can I get another one of those please, Barry? BARRY for once is silent, pours a pint. The regulars try not to stare. \nMARILYN I didn't want to leave without saying goodbye. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 117A. \nMARILYN hands COLIN a package. \nMARILYN (CONT'D) The first time you saw this, all I had on was the radio. Colin opens the package. It's her copy of the script. On the first page she has written a message scrawled in ink: TO THE \nMOST CHARMING THIRD ASSISTANT DIRECTOR IN THE WORLD \n", "test1_input": "BARRY The room's three quid a week, first week in advance. You're in number two. COLIN takes the key and his bag, just as BARRY adds, with perfect deadpan timing: \nBARRY (CONT'D) You'll be sharing with Grace Kelly. The LOCALS laugh into their beer. COLIN smiles gamely. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 27B. \n45 INT. DOG AND DUCK PUB. COLIN'S ROOM. DAY. 45 \nCOLIN stands aghast. He is staying in a grim little room above the noisy saloon bar. The wallpaper is peeling, the furniture is ancient and the whole place reeks of damp. Dirty net curtains flutter in the window. He puts his bag on the bed and sits down. The mattress sags pitifully. He looks down and finds a stained and yellowing chamber pot under the bed. He slides it back with a look of revulsion. \nCUT TO: \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 28. \n46 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 46 \nThe principal cast of The Sleeping Prince, as it was still known at the time, assemble on the sound stage amongst the half-finished set. They chat and smoke, their scripts in their hands. OLIVIER stands in their midst, very much first amongst equals. One chair sits conspicuously unoccupied. DAME SYBIL THORNDIKE (74), severe-looking but kindly, very much the grand dame of the gathering, smiles cheerfully. RICHARD WATTIS leans over to her with a cheerful grin. \nWATTIS What a wonderful adventure, Dame Sybil. \nSYBIL THORNDIKE Such a lark! I long to see her. COLIN stands by the door. OLIVIER looks at his watch and shoots him a questioning glance. \nCUT TO: \n47 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. CORRIDOR/DRESSING ROOM. DAY. 47 \nCOLIN hurries along the corridor and stops outside Marilyn's dressing room. He knocks on it politely. \nCOLIN Miss Monroe? The door opens sharply and a small, bohemian looking woman in her 50s stands staring at him. This is PAULA STRASBERG. \nCOLIN (CONT'D) Sir Laurence sends his compliments. He's ready for the \nREADTHROUGH He glances beyond PAULA to where MARILYN sits by the mirror, her reflection framed in the lights. She wears little or no make-up. PAULA looks at him sharply. \nPAULA But Marilyn is not ready. She's preparing. MARILYN glances up at COLIN in the mirror and smiles with unexpected simplicity. \nMARILYN Excuse the horrible face. She finds her dark glasses on the dresser and puts them on. \nCUT TO: \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 29. \n48 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. CORRIDOR. DAY. 48 \nCOLIN leads MARILYN and PAULA to the rehearsal room. He sneaks a glance at her. She has a vulnerable, lost expression. COLIN can't help staring at her until he notices PAULA looking at him and quickly glances away. \nCUT TO: \n49 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 49 \nThe cast are all seated around the large table as COLIN leads MARILYN and PAULA onto the stage. Marilyn keeps her dark glasses on throughout. OLIVIER rises to greet her. \nOLIVIER Marilyn, here you are, everyone is so excited to meet you... He gestures to the company. \nOLIVIER (CONT'D) Let us begin. Do sit down, please... SYBIL THORNDIKE looks sweetly at MARILYN from across the table and indicates the empty one at her side. \nSYBIL THORNDIKE How lovely you are. Here, I kept a place for you. PAULA bursts forward, steering Marilyn away instead to an empty seat on the other side of the rectangle of tables. She looks at RICHARD WATTIS, the actor occupying the seat next to the empty one. \nPAULA I have to be next to Marilyn! The startled WATTIS gets up graciously and troops all the way around the table to the seat next to SYBIL THORNDIKE. \nSYBIL THORNDIKE \n(TO MARILYN) Don't worry, dear, we won't bite. PAULA looks at her in truculent apology. \nPAULA She likes me by her side. \nSYBIL THORNDIKE What a good idea! I wish we could all bring a friend. One does get so terribly nervous. It's just like the first day at school, isn't it? \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 30. \nShe smiles kindly at MARILYN who smiles back tentatively from behind her dark glasses. He smiles with considerable charm as he makes his opening speech of welcome. \nOLIVIER Welcome dear Marilyn, to our little fraternity. (Pause, looks around) We may seem a little strange and quaint to you at first, but I hope that in time you may come to find your method in our madness. Pleased with his over-contrived rhetorical flourish, he gives Paula a pointed look. She glowers back, obscurely sensing that she has been insulted in some way. MARILYN also looks up in confusion at Olivier's well intentioned but clumsy joke. Oblivious to her reaction, he opens his script with a sentimental flourish. \nOLIVIER (CONT'D) So. My very noble and approv'd good masters, let us now embark on our great voyage of discovery together. (Pause) With boldness and (we pray) good fortune, may we strive to create a work of art that, led by your good graces, will be cherished as long as motion pictures may be remembered. He is momentarily close to tears. WATTIS rolls his eyes discreetly, earning a grin from the actor PAUL HARDWICK. There is a rustle of pages and a few coughs, a mood of eager nervousness in the air as they all prepare for the reading. \nCUT TO: \n50 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 50 \nPage 10. PAULA turns the pages of MARILYN's script for her, as though helping a child to read. OLIVIER is in full flow, employing a heavy Mittel European accent. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 31. \nOLIVIER (AS REGENT) \"Were you surprised to get my invitation?\" MARILYN stares at him for a beat then reads haltingly. \nMARILYN (AS ELSIE) \"I'll say I was surprised. I was so surprised I couldn't hardly think you meant me.\" \n", "test1_true": "MARILYN Gee, Mister Sir, I could listen to your accent all day. There are private grins amongst the actors. OLIVIER smiles kindly. \nOLIVIER You are amongst friends, my darling angel. Just plain Larry will suffice. (Pause) When you're ready..? Flustered, MARILYN looks at her script. \nMARILYN (AS ELSIE) \"Well, Maisie Springfield... \nOLIVIER (AS REGENT) \"Oh, no, no, no not Maisie Springfield, she's quite what I would call old hat... PAULA leans across, mounting a whispered running commentary in Marilyn's ear as OLIVIER speaks. \nPAULA Remember why you're in the embassy, Marilyn. What does the Grand Duke want from Elsie? She thought there were going to be a lot of people here and it's just her. OLIVIER waits patiently. \nOLIVIER It's your line, Marilyn. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 31A. \nMARILYN Oh, let's see... \"Oh, and am I what you'd call new hat?\" \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 32. \nOLIVIER tries to continue but is yet again brought up short by PAULA's passionate whispering. \nPAULA Locate the experience, Marilyn. Look for the memory that helps you. Remember when you went to that party at Chaplin's house and you were the only guest? How did that make you feel? This time OLIVIER stares at PAULA. \nOLIVIER It is only a readthrough, Paula. \nPAULA Marilyn has to begin finding the character. \nOLIVIER The character is on the page. \nPAULA The words, maybe. Not the character. RICHARD WATTIS whispers to PAUL HARDWICK. \nWATTIS She's half cut! DAME SYBIL THORNDIKE frowns with regal disapproval and smiles warmly at MARILYN. \nSYBIL THORNDIKE Aren't we going to have fun? \n51 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 51 \nThe readthrough over, OLIVIER rails quietly at MILTON while COLIN clears up the tea cups and plates used by the actors. \nOLIVIER We can't have two fucking directors! \nMILTON Marilyn wants Paula. \nOLIVIER Why? She's got me! \nMILTON Paula is costing us two and half thousand bucks a week. We might as well use her. (Pause) Listen Larry, accept Marilyn on her own terms and you'll be okay. \n(MORE) \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 32A. \nMILTON (CONT'D) Try to change her and she'll drive you crazy. Trust me. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 33. \nOLIVIER stalks away. COLIN takes a chance and follows him. \nOLIVIER Dear Christ, what have I got myself into? \nCUT TO: \n52 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. WARDROBE DEPT. DAY. 52 \nCOLIN follows LUCY the WARDROBE GIRL down a rack of clothes. He is charming, glib and persistent. \nCOLIN Come out with me tonight. \nLUCY I'm working. \nCOLIN Tomorrow night, then. \nLUCY I'm washing my hair. \nCOLIN Your hair's lovely. She stops to look at him, attracted but cautious. \nLUCY Look, I have two rules. One, never touch the talent... \nCOLIN Everyone has a lot of rules around here. \nLUCY ... and two, never go out with thirds. \nCOLIN Why not? \nLUCY Because they're all randy little buggers who just want some fun during shooting. \nCOLIN I'm not like that. She looks at him sceptically. \n", "test1_id": 1800, "test2_input": "COLIN Paula was with us the whole time. \nWATTIS The mind boggles, dear. COLIN smiles but his expression freezes as he looks up to see LUCY nearby. She has heard every word of the exchange. \nCUT TO: \n90 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 90 \nMARILYN is finally back on the set, filming a solo dance routine. Released from the need to remember any words she takes refuge in the physical activity, undulating sexily in her tight white dress in a performance which is gawky, mildly silly and charming all at the same time. The dance is deliberately a little amateurish. Elsie Marina isn't meant to be any sort of superstar. But she radiates joy and innocence and sheer happiness in the dance, and MARILYN captures all this perfectly. Within the scene the actor JEREMY SPENSER, playing Nicky, watches from the doorway. Everyone watches silently from behind the camera. No one can look away, least of all COLIN. It feels like one purely joyful moment in the agony the film has become, and Marilyn is radiant. Even OLIVIER has a reluctant half-smile on his face as he watches. \nCUT TO: \n91 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. NIGHT. 91 \nThe stage is empty except for OLIVIER and MILLER. They sit in a pool of light in the cavernous room. COLIN pours whisky for them and then steps back into the shadows. Both men ignore him. He is too unimportant to worry about. MILLER leans forward, holding his pipe but not smoking it. \nMILLER I dreamed last night I could hear singing. And then I realised it wasn't a dream. There was a male voice choir serenading Marilyn under our window. At two in the morning. It's a circus. A freak show. OLIVIER smiles but MILLER looks dazed. \nMILLER (CONT'D) I'm going back to New York for a few days. I need to see my kids. I need a break. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 65. \nOLIVIER That won't help Marilyn. \nMILLER (After a moment) I can't help her. (Pause) You know what she loves to do most? Sleep. It's what she lives for. Sleep is her demon. He pauses for a second. \nMILLER (CONT'D) I've disappointed her. OLIVIER looks at him. MILLER shakes his head. \nMILLER (CONT'D) She thought I could smash all her insecurities with one magical stroke. That I could make her a new person. He pauses for a second, weighing every word carefully. \nMILLER (CONT'D) She wants me to protect her but I can't. I can't even protect myself. (Pause) She read some notes I made. They were nothing. Just a few ideas. \nOLIVIER About her? He looks up and nods slowly. \nMILLER She took them the wrong way. He leaves a long, uneasy pause. \nOLIVIER But you do love her? Your new bride and all that? MILLER plays with his whisky. \nMILLER I can't work. I can't think. (Pause) She's devouring me. Forgotten in the shadows, COLIN listens attentively to every word. \nCUT TO: \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 66. \n92 EXT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. GATE. DAY. 92 \nEarly morning. COLIN sees Olivier's black Bentley cruising towards the gate. VIVIEN LEIGH sits in the back seat. \nVIVIEN Hello, Colin darling. You look like Horatio defending the bridge. Are you going to let me in? \nCUT TO: \n93 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 93 \nVIVIEN is doing what amounts to a royal tour. She greets everyone, from the lowest chippie to the Heads of Department with the same flirtatious grace. OLIVIER walks at her elbow. The crew crowd around her. She is easy and relaxed, relishing every second of their attention. \nVIVIEN I hope Larry isn't making you all work too hard. I know what a dreadful slave driver he can be. She sees ORTON and takes his hands. \nVIVIEN (CONT'D) David, he would be lost without you. \nORTON Just doing my job. Tough as he is, he melts visibly. She moves on to JACK CARDIFF, the lighting cameraman, looking at him in mock misery. \nVIVIEN I'm getting old, Jack. I need you to work your miracles on me. \nCARDIFF You're more beautiful every year, Vivien. She laughs and turns to COLIN, looking at him severely. \nVIVIEN Now, you are looking after Larry like I told you? \nCOLIN I'm doing my best... VIVIEN glances away to see MARILYN standing nearby, awkward and excluded. She has come straight from make-up and wears only a towelling robe, slippers and curlers in her hair. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 67. \nCompared to VIVIEN she looks frumpish. VIVIEN glides towards her, hands extended. \nVIVIEN Darling Marilyn! She kisses her on both cheeks and holds her hands. \nVIVIEN (CONT'D) Larry tells me you are quite, quite superb. I'm wild with jealousy. \nMARILYN Oh, but everyone says you were a wonderful Elsie on stage. \nVIVIEN But I'm too old to play her in the film. Larry was quite brutal about that. You see, the truth is all that matters to him. That's why we all admire him so very much. She glances at OLIVIER with a fluttering laugh. He smiles back with a haunted look in his eyes. \nVIVIEN (CONT'D) Now, I must let you work. I only came to wish you good luck! Goodbye, everyone! The crew press around her. MARILYN watches, feeling more than ever the odd one out. COLIN watches her from the edge of the crowd. She cuts a lonely, vulnerable figure. He is totally preoccupied with her, so much so that when VIVIEN comes up behind him he turns guiltily as though caught out. VIVIEN stares at him. All her exuberance has vanished and she looks suddenly tired and older. It as though the facade of a beautiful building is beginning to crack. She gazes at him with bitter disappointment. \nVIVIEN (CONT'D) Oh, Colin. Not you too. He wants to protest but VIVIEN is already turning away. \nCUT TO: \n", "test2_true": "BOOTH. DAY. COLIN pushes open the door to the projection booth. The screen is lit up with the rushes of the scene in The Prince And The Showgirl where a startlingly beautiful MARILYN, in gorgeous close-up, eats caviar and drinks champagne in a toast to the American President. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 68. \nOLIVIER and VIVIEN stand in the shadows of the projector beam. COLIN freezes in the doorway to the projection booth holding a pile of film cans. VIVIEN is crying abjectly. \nVIVIEN I didn't think she would be so beautiful. She... shines on that screen. \nOLIVIER You shouldn't upset yourself. You are ten times the actress she will ever be. \nVIVIEN If you could see yourself. The way you watch her... \nOLIVIER There's never been anything between Marilyn and me. She laughs hysterically. \nVIVIEN Only because she didn't want you. \nOLIVIER You're imagining things. \nVIVIEN Do you think I'm a fool? You didn't think the little tart could resist the great Laurence Olivier. She looks at him venomously, a dangerous, unbalanced hatred seething in her expression. VIVIEN (CONT'D) (cont'd) But she saw through you, didn't she darling? Take away the actor and what's left of the man? You can't even play the husband properly without a script. (slaps him hard across the face. ) I hope she makes your life hell! \nOLIVIER Vivien..! She storms out. After a beat, COLIN tentatively enters. OLIVIER looks at COLIN in muted apology. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 69. \nOLIVIER (CONT'D) She hasn't been well. There was a baby... she... we... lost it... COLIN looks down awkwardly. OLIVIER sighs. \nOLIVIER (CONT'D) (After a pause) Do you have a cigarette, Colin? COLIN hurries to offer him one of his \"Oliviers\". OLIVIER grimaces wryly. \nOLIVIER (CONT'D) Not one of those awful things. COLIN finds a woodbine in his other pocket and gives it to OLIVIER, who lights it with a shaking hand. He inhales deeply. \nOLIVIER (CONT'D) Vivien's right... I did think I would fall shatteringly in love with Marilyn. What a joke. He looks at COLIN, his feelings raw and exposed. \nOLIVIER (CONT'D) Remember, boy, when it comes to women you are never too old for humiliation. \nCUT TO: \n95 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 95 \nThe set is dressed and the crew are waiting but once again there is no sign of Marilyn. The actors, RICHARD WATTIS and PAUL HARDWICK amongst them, sit apathetically in full costume, while ORTON stands with his arms folded. Technicians chat or sit idly. As COLIN watches, OLIVIER looks across at MILTON who shrugs hopelessly. \nCUT TO: \n96 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. OLIVIER'S DRESSING 96 \nROOM/PARKSIDE. DAY. COLIN pours whisky for OLIVIER. MILTON comes in. \nMILTON Marilyn won't shoot today. She's gone back to Parkside. She's upset about Arthur leaving England. \nOLIVIER He's only going to visit his children. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 70. \nMILTON You don't leave Marilyn alone. She can't handle it. She thinks everyone's going to abandon her. The phone rings. OLIVIER picks with a sudden burst of optimism. \nOLIVIER Perhaps she's come back. (Into the phone) Yes? \nROGER \n(OFF) Sir Laurence? It's Roger. \nOLIVIER Oh, Roger. What's up? \nROGER \n(OFF) Is Colin there, Sir? He frowns and looks at COLIN in bewilderment. \nOLIVIER Yes, he's here. (Pause) It's for you. Puzzled, COLIN takes the phone as OLIVIER stares at him. \nCOLIN Roger? CUT TO PARKSIDE, where, to Colin's astonishment MARILYN comes on the line (Roger is not in shot). \nMARILYN \n(ON PHONE) Colin, why don't you drop by here on your way home? CUT BACK TO PINEWOOD - MILTON recognises Marilyn's voice instantly. \nMILTON What the heck? \nOLIVIER Why is Marilyn on the phone to my third fucking assistant? COLIN looks around helplessly. \nCOLIN Yes, I'm sure I can do that. CUT TO PARKSIDE. MARILYN smiles. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 70A. \nMARILYN \n(ON PHONE) Good. Don't tell anyone though. She hangs up. CUT TO PINEWOOD: COLIN replaces the phone in its cradle. MILTON and OLIVIER stare at him. \n", "test2_id": 1801, "test3_input": "112 DELETED 112 \n113 EXT. WINDSOR GREAT PARK. DAY. 113 \nCOLIN and MARILYN walk barefoot in the grass of Windsor Great Park while ROGER leans on the bonnet of the parked Wolsey, holding shoes, socks, and sandals. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 84. \nThere is no one else around. The wind sighs and the grass is pleasantly warm underfoot. MARILYN turns her face up to the sun. \nMARILYN This is how I ought to feel every day. COLIN smiles. Impulsively MARILYN hugs him. \nMARILYN (CONT'D) Let's run away together. He turns ashen. \nMARILYN (CONT'D) \n(LAUGHS) Just kidding. She looks around happily. COLIN smiles at her. \nCOLIN We have today, anyway. One day to do whatever we like. We can go back to real life tomorrow. \nMARILYN Only one day? \nCOLIN Well, maybe the weekend. \nMARILYN Or a week? He grins. She takes his hand, walking contentedly at his side. \nMARILYN (CONT'D) What shall we do? \nCOLIN We could go to Windsor Castle, if you like. MARILYN's face breaks into a smile of pure delight. \nCUT TO: \n114 EXT. WINDSOR CASTLE. GRAND DRIVE.

DAY. 115 \nROGER has parked up by the sentry post at the entrance to the castle. There are two uniformed POLICEMEN on duty. ROGER nods to the policemen, who instantly recognise one of their own. \nROGER Detective Chief Superintendant Smith. I'm escorting this lady and gentleman for the day. They'd like to look around the castle. As the policemen see MARILYN their eyes widen. \nPOLICEMAN Christ, is that..? He stares in disbelief. ROGER smiles. \nROGER Well, it's not Diana bloody Dors, is it? \nPOLICEMAN (After a second) Does she know anyone here, sir? We need to write down a contact name in the book. ROGER looks stumped at this. He turns to Marilyn. \nROGER You don't know Her Majesty, by any chance? \nMARILYN We met at a movie premiere. She said my dress was pretty. \nPOLICEMAN I'm not sure that quite... \nCOLIN \n(INTERRUPTING) My Godfather works here. He's the Royal librarian, Sir Owen Morshead. The POLICEMAN looks sceptically at Colin's casual clothes. \nPOLICEMAN Name? \nCOLIN Clark. Colin Clark. The POLICEMAN retreats into his box. We hear him talking on the telephone. ROGER looks at COLIN. He shrugs sheepishly. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 86. \nCOLIN (CONT'D) My father knows everybody. A moment later the policeman returns, looking surprised. \nPOLICEMAN He says to go straight up the hill, sir. You'll be met at the door. \nCUT TO: \n115A INT. WINDSOR CASTLE. CORRIDORS. DAY. 115A \nCOLIN and MARILYN are led by a FOOTMAN down the long corridor. MARILYN looks awed by the ancient suits of armour standing regally along the way. COLIN watches her, enjoying her reaction. \nCUT TO: \n115B INT. WINDSOR CASTLE. GOLDEN CORRIDOR. DAY. 115B \nCOLIN and MARILYN are led into another corridor, this one with a beautiful gold-leaf ceiling decoration. MARILYN looks up, enchanted. \nCUT TO: \n116 INT. WINDSOR CASTLE. ROYAL LIBRARY.

He smiles at MARILYN, showing no sign whatever of recognising her. \nMORSHEAD (CONT'D) You are pretty, my dear. I'm sure you and Colin have so much in common. MARILYN looks around in awe. \nMARILYN Gee, I'd love to read all these books some time. \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 87. \nMORSHEAD Luckily one doesn't really have to. A lot of them just have pictures in. He finds a portfolio on the table and opens it. \nMORSHEAD (CONT'D) These are by an artist called Holbein. MARILYN smiles at a portrait of a young woman. \nMARILYN She's beautiful. \nMORSHEAD She was the daughter of one of the King's courtiers, nearly 400 years ago. \nMARILYN I hope I look that good when I'm \nMORSHEAD laughs. He takes down another folder of drawings. \nMORSHEAD And these are all by Leonardo Da Vinci. \nMARILYN I've heard of him! Didn't he paint that lady with the funny smile? She looks at him, wide-eyed, playing up to her image as the dizzy blonde. In fact she knows exactly who Da Vinci is, and MORSHEAD is tactful enough to acknowledge it gracefully. \nMORSHEAD The Mona Lisa. \nMARILYN Do you have that one here too? \nMORSHEAD Alas, that one got away. He closes the portfolio and takes MARILYN's arm briskly. \nMORSHEAD (CONT'D) Now, let's go to the Queen's apartments. She's not here at the moment, but she will be sorry to have missed you. MARILYN looks at him, wide-eyed. \nMARILYN Really? \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 88. \nMORSHEAD Oh, yes. Why, she was only saying to me the other day, \"what must it be like to be the most famous woman on earth\"? He shares a sly smile with COLIN. He knows exactly who Marilyn is and is enjoying every second of her company. He leads her out, with COLIN trailing in their wake. \nMORSHEAD (CONT'D) Some of the rooms are very opulent but I think there's something you might like better than all that. \nCUT TO: \n117 DELETED 117 \n118 INT. WINDSOR CASTLE. DOLLS' ROOM. DAY. 118 \nOPEN on a massive dolls' house. Everything imaginable is inside - beds, chairs, baths, basins, even small rugs and chandeliers, all perfectly to scale. MARILYN kneels in front of it, gazing from room to room with childlike joy. It is so big she can lean inside and see the detail in every room. She cries out with joy. \nMARILYN Look, Colin. COLIN kneels at her side. \nMARILYN (CONT'D) I sure never had a dolls' house like this when I was a kid. She sees a perfect doll family inside, husband, wife and two children. She points at them, her eyes shining. \nMARILYN (CONT'D) This is me, that's you, and these are our kids. She smiles wistfully and puts her hand on his arm. \nMARILYN (CONT'D) Our daughter's so pretty. All little girls should be told how pretty they are. They should grow up knowing how much their mother loves them. Her eyes fill with sadness for a moment. \nMARILYN (CONT'D) We look like such a happy family, don't we? \nMY WEEK WITH MARILYN 89. \nShe turns to him. They are only inches away from each other. COLIN's heart lurches. MORSHEAD coughs discreetly. \nMORSHEAD You mustn't let me keep you. I'm sure you're longing to be on your way. \nCUT TO: \n119 EXT. WINDSOR CASTLE. COURT YARD. DAY. 119 \nCOLIN and MARILYN emerge. A small crowd of POLICEMEN, SERVANTS and CASTLE WORKERS has gathered. There are cheers as they see her. COLIN looks nervously at MARILYN but she smiles and winks at him, mocking herself gently. \nMARILYN Shall I be \"her\"? She jumps up onto a step and strikes a pose - hip out, shoulders back, bosom thrust forward, the classic Marilyn \"look\". The delighted crowd bursts into cheers. COLIN stands proudly nearby, content to watch Marilyn being a star, basking in the certain knowledge that she will be leaving with him. One of the spectators turns to him. \nSPECTATOR Are you somebody, mate? \nCOLIN \n(SMILES) I'm no one. COLIN stares at MARILYN. She catches his eye and smiles, just for him.

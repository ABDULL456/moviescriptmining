The same eggheads who, earlier, had no interest in Ed. Now they're all worked up. 
PANEL MEMBER #1 But he's not a normal person anymore. He's a celebrity. We're no longer observing anyone's "real life." 
PANEL MEMBER #2 (disagreeing) But that's what's interesting! The effect of celebrity on an otherwise average person. 
PANEL MEMBER #3 But do you really feel that Ed is an average person? I mean this guy seems to have a... magnetism, a charisma that, I think, transcends the entire concept. 
PANEL MEMBER #4 I agree. He's special. 
They all nod.

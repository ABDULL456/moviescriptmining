Foley just looks at him. 
EXT. BUSY STREET - NIGHT 
As Buddy pulls the van into an alley.  He jumps out, jogs back to the street and hails a cab... 
INT. CAB - SAME 
Buddy suddenly gets in, bangs on the bulletproof glass. 
BUDDY The airport. 
The cab pulls away.  Buddy glances up front, then pulls the Ziploc bag from his coat and holds it up.  There's a bit of water in along with the diamonds.  A tiny fish swims in the water.  Something about this makes Buddy smile as we... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. KAREN'S HOTEL - MORNING 
The sun is out.  The sky is clear. 
KAREN (VO) They don't know yet if they want to bring him up on the homicides. 
INT. KAREN'S HOTEL ROOM - MORNING 
Karen on the phone.  Her suitcase on the bed. 
KAREN I doubt if they will.  The Bureau's put a detainer on him, so when they're through with him here he'll go back to Florida. 
INT. MARSHALL SISCO'S SITTING ROOM - SAME 
Marshall on the phone... 
MARSHALL You gonna go get him? 
KAREN It's possible.  Why? 
MARSHALL I was just thinking... you could have a nice time with him on the plane -- like picking up where your interlude, or whatever you call it, left off. And then throw him in the can. 
KAREN He knew what he was doing.  Nobody forced him to rob banks. 
MARSHALL My little girl, the tough babe. 
Karen hangs up, stares thoughtfully out the window. 
INT. PRISON CELL - DAY 
Where Foley stands staring out of his window. 
VOICE Foley. 
As Foley turns around and faces a FEDERAL MARSHAL in the doorway, we see that Foley's hands and feet are shackled. 
INT/EXT. PRISON STATION GARAGE - DAY 
The Marshal leads Foley from the building to where a black government van waits.  The Marshal helps Foley inside. 
FEDERAL MARSHAL Have a nice trip. (looks OS) I'll get the other one. 
INT/EXT. VAN - SAME 
As Foley sits down, stares at the floor.  He looks depressed. We hear the front door open, then close. 
KAREN (OS) Jack? 
He looks to where Karen looks at him through a steel grate that separates the front from the back. 
KAREN I got you a present, something for the road. 
She pushes A ZIPPO THROUGH the grate. 
KAREN (CONT'D) I have to take it away, though, soon as the ride's over. 
Before Foley can say anything, the back door is opened once more and the Marshal helps ANOTHER PRISONER -- a black man with a shaved head -- into the back of the van. 
FEDERAL MARSHAL Jack Foley meet Hejira Henry. 
An annoyed Foley stares at the guy as the marshal shuts the door then gets in up front with Karen. 
FOLEY Hejira?  What kinda name is that? 
HEJIRA Islamic. 
FOLEY What's it mean, "No Hair"? 
HEJIRA The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed from Mecca in 622. 
FOLEY The flight? 
HEJIRA The brothers in Leavenworth gave me the name. 
FOLEY You were at Leavenworth, huh? 
HEJIRA For a time. 
FOLEY Meaning? 
HEJIRA Meaning time came, I left. 
FOLEY You busted out? 
HEJIRA I prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place. 
FOLEY (interested now) And how long was it before they caught up with you? 
HEJIRA That time? 
FOLEY There were others. 
HEJIRA Yeah.  That was the ninth. 
FOLEY (really interested) The ninth?

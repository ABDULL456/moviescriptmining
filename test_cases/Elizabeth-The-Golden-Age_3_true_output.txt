RALEIGH D rawn away by the brightest light of all. 
BESS That can only mean the Queen.

RALEIGH A second Elizabeth. 
BESS Everyone calls me Bess. S he goes back to the Queen, as Elizabeth is rising to leave. She speaks to the company. 
ELIZABETH His highness the Archduke informs me that my charms overwhelm him. He will retire to his private quarters to rest.

STANLEY What are you.. Please don't... Then she pops the hook through the lid and pulls the fishing line back over his head. Stanley screams something fierce as she continues to thread his eyelid open, slowly, methodically, delivering as much pain with every pull of the line, from one eye to the next. His eyeballs bulge unnaturally, twitching wildly-- All Stanley can do is stare ahead and watch himself on the monitor. 
JENNIFER I'll be back before you have a chance to blink. Jennifer stands up and brushes herself off and walks to-- WITH ANDY: Jennifer comes over and slaps him in the head.

JENNIFER (CONT'D) How ya' doing sport? 
ANDY Please... please... I can't... 
JENNIFER Please? I thought, no, I'm pretty sure you said something like this... Jennifer grabs a wad of his HAIR and SMASHES his face into 
THE WATER- 
JENNIFER (CONT'D) Suck it bitch. She pulls his head back up. 
JENNIFER (CONT'D) Does that ring any bells? Jennifer gets real close to his ear-- 
JENNIFER (CONT'D) 
SUCK-- She slams his head back down and holds it - then up-- 
JENNIFER (CONT'D) 
IT-- She slams his head back down again and holds it then up-- 
JENNIFER (CONT'D) Bi tch. She holds his head down for a very long time as his body struggles - then up. Andy gasps for breath as Stanley's screams get louder-- 
JENNIFER (CONT'D) I think Stanley's calling me. I'll be right back. If you need me- She walks off-- 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 81. BACK TO STANLEY: Both eyelids hooked open, blood and tears stream down his face, a gruesome sight. 
JENNIFER (CONT'D) Like the show so far? 
(BEAT) Wait, it gets better. 
STANLEY Please... Please... My eyes... I can't take it anymore... please... 
JENNIFER Let me help you. Jennifer takes a slender knife from the bag. Working quickly, Jennifer guts a FISH. 
JENNIFER (CONT'D) Here, this might feel better. She leans in and smears the bloody fish guts onto Stanley's eyeballs.

85 TNT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY 85 The water has filled up the trough and is overflowing. Andy struggles to lift his head up to draw a few quick breaths. Jennifer climbs onto his back and GRABS his hair pulling his head up. 
JENNIFER Don't drown too soon. Andy tries to buck her off, gasping for breath, buckling under her added weight. Jennifer slams his head back into the water, and then up again... then down as she holds it. 
JENNIFER (CONT'D) Hold it... hold it... hold it... Then she pulls his head back up as Andy spits water all over. 
ANDY 
(CHOKING) Fuck you... fuck you...

JENNIFER Now is that any way to talk to a lady? And back down with his head - it is exhausting to watch. WITH STANLEY: As a single CROW shows up by his head. He tries to look at the bird to see what it is doing, but he can't move. ON THE MONITOR: The CROW has jumped onto Stanley's head - looking at his eyes -- It begins to peck at them. Stanley

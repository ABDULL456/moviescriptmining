Everybody else in the audience just stares at him. 
KYLE'S MOTHER Next up we have a special treat... Please welcome, direct from Vegas- BIG GAY AL'S BIG GAY EXPERIENCE!!! 
The place goes wild as Big Gay Al walks out on stage.  Winona fumes in the wings. 
RANDOM SOLDIER This guy is the coolest! 
RANDOM SOLDIER 2 Totally man! 
The back curtain goes up to reveal a tropical jungle set complete with a waterfall, hippos, monkeys and hundreds of colorfully dressed dancers. 
BIG GAY AL How we all feeling tonight?! 
Between the cheering, we hear a throng of "Happy!". Now the place is rocking!! Everybody loves Big Gay Al! 
Winona can't believe it.

BIG GAY AL Friends, you know why I'm here... I'm here to teach TOLERANCE!! 
The crowd cheers. 
BIG GAY AL I'm here to say that we're all PEOPLE under God, and we should embrace, and accept our differences!! 
The crowd cheers louder. 
BIG GAY AL And that means we should LOVE CANADIANS TOO!! 
The entire place goes incredibly quiet. 
You can hear a pin drop. 
Silence... 
Deafening silence... 
BIG GAY AL JUST KIDDING!! FUCK 'EM!!! 
Slow music swells in. Big Gay Al saunters around the stage and starts to sing. 
BIG GAY AL (Singing) Bombs are flying People are dying Children are crying Politicians are lying too Cancer is killing Texaco is spilling The whole world's gone to hell But how are you? 
Suddenly, Big Gay Al is wearing a big feathery outfit and all his dancers dash to his side. 
BIG GAY AL I'm super!  Thanks for asking! All things considered I'm doing super I must say! Very peachee Nothing bugs me 'Cause everything is super when you're -don't you think I look cute in this hat? 
The crowd is absolutely confused. 
BIG GAY AL I'm so sorry, Mr. Cripple But I just can't feel bad for you right now Because I'm feeling so insanely super That even seeing you in that chair can't bring me down! 
EXT. INTERNMENT CAMP - ANOTHER AREA 
Cartman is by himself, slowly moving from building to building. He is scared out of his mind. 
CARTMAN (Imitating the Mole) Shut of ze Power, Cartman. Zis is very important, Cartman... Stupid British piece of shi- (BAZZT!) OW! 
He approaches the electrical box.  Just as he's about to open it, two armed AMERICAN SOLDIERS round the corner.  Cartman gets scared and hides in the shadows.  The soldiers continue walking... 
AMERICAN SOLDIER Dude, if I was gay, I'd be just like Big Gay AL! 
AMERICAN SOLDIER 2 Me too!! 
...And pass a terrified Cartman. 
EXT. INTERNMENT CAMP - STAN AND KYLE'S AREA 
The boys are waiting, bored, for The Mole to return. 
KYLE I don't think he's coming back, dude. 
Just then, we hear The Mole return from his hole. He is carrying the ticket guy from the movie theater. 
TICKET GUY Oh thank you! Thank you for getting me out of there!! They locked me up for selling movie tickets to minors! 
THE MOLE Is this one of zem? 
KYLE No! That's not Terrance or Phillip! 
THE MOLE Oh... Alright, back you go. 
The Mole takes the Ticket Guy back through the hole. 
TICKET GUY No! Please! I don't want to go back!! 
The boys sit back down and wait again. 
EXT. USO SHOW/STAGE - CONTINUOUS 
Meanwhile, Big Gay Al's song continues- 
BIG GAY AL I'm super! Thanks for asking! All things considered I'm doing better than okay! Feeling peaches nothing bugs me Everything is super when you're -don't you think I look cute in this hat and my little shoes and this matching tie that I got at Merv's?

CHORUS He's super! Thanks for asking! All things considered he is better than okay! And it's peachee, nothing bugs him Everything is super when you're- Let's fight fight fight against Canada today!!!!!! 
The song ends and everyone erupts into applause. 
INT. HELL - DAY 
Satan is looking into a large, oracle-like ball. Saddam isn't around, but a few demons and Kenny are hanging out.

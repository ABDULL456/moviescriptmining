Where and when do you expect this vampire to attack? \n(CONTINUED) \npk Rev. 11/6/84 24. \n32 CONTINUED: (2) \nCHARLEY In my bedroom. Tonight. Evil Ed puts down his brush and pulls a dime store cross from his desk. He hands it to-Charley. \nEVIL ED Start with this. Of course, you have to have faith for it to work. Then get some wolfbane -- \nCHARLEY What? \nEVIL ED Forget it. Get some garlic, links of the stuff you can wear around your neck and hang from your window. If he comes for you,, that'll be the way. Then, of course, there's holy water. But you need a priest to say a blessing over it first. He goes back to his painting. Charley stares at him. \nCHARLEY That's all? \nEVIL ED 'I'm afraid so. Of course, they can change into wolves and bats at will and I don't know what you do about that. But your best protection right now is that a vampire can't enter your house without being invited by the rightful owner first. \nCHARLEY You sure about that? \nEVIL ED Positive. \nSMASH CUT TO: \n33 OMITTED \nTHRU \n36 INT. CHARLEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nCharley steps back to stare at his window, finished at last. Be's done the best he can, nailing-it shut, strewing it with garlic, his chest of drawers shoved in front of it, partially blocking. it. \n(CONTINUED) \nA \n36 CONTINUED: The cross Evil Ed gave him sits on his desk. He tests the window. It's secure. His mother calls up to him from the portico below. \nJUDY (O.S.) Charley, come down here, please. There's someone I want you to meet. He turns and walks out of the room, feeling better now. \n37 \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 INT. PORTICO - STAIRWAY - NIGHT \nHe bounces down the stairs and turns toward the door to the living room. \n38 INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nHe walks into the living room to find his mother standing there, a drink in her hand. \nCHARLEY Yeah, Mom -- \nJUDY Charley, this is.our next door neighbor, Jerry Dandrige. Charley freezes. Jerry Dandrige sits in the best chair, a drink in his hand, smiling at Charley. He's even better looking close up, almost blindingly beautiful, too much so actually. There's something disturbing about it, as though such good looks have to cover up an inner putrefaction, some sort of hidden, sweet, sickly rot just beneath the perfect pale skin. He rises, the smile widening as he sees the terror in Charley's eyes. He holds his hand out as Judy watches her son for his reaction. \nJERRY Hello, Charley. Charley just stares at him. \nJUDY Well, shake hands, Charley. There's no reason to be rude. Charley slowly crosses to Jerry and takes his hand, shaking it as one would the hand of a recently disinterred corpse. Judy.smiles, pleased with herself. \n(CONTINUED) \n38 CONTINUED: \nCHARLEY \nWhat's he doing here? \nJUDY (rising and smiling \nAT JERRY) I invited him over for a drink. \nCHARLEY (stone cold horrified) You what? \nJUDY (a bit taken aback by the intensity of her \n", "test1_true": "JERRY What's wrong, Charley? Afraid I'd never come over without being invited first? You're quite right. But, of course, now that I've been made welcome, I'll probably drop by quite a bit. His voice changes, suddenly charged with double meaning, his eyes burning into Charley. \nJERRY In fact, anytime I feel like it. (changing tack, turn- ing back to Judy) With your mother's kind permission, of course. \nJUDY \n(TOTALLY ENRAPTURED \nWITH HIM) Of course, Jerry. You're welcome anytime. It's so nice someone interesting has finally moved into the neighborhood. It's so dull around here. I mean how many nights can you play Trivial Pursuit? Right, Jerry? \nJERRY \nRight, Judy. Charley watches this scene, backing across the room, terri- fied. He suddenly hits an end table, knocking it with a crash to the floor. Judy looks at him. He's ghost white. \n(CONTINUED) \nch Rev.. 12/4/84 27. \n38 CONTINUED: (2) \nJUDY Charley,. are you all right? \nCHARLEY (his eyes on Jerry as he backs for the door) Yeah, fine. I've just got to get back to my trigonometry, that's. all. \nJERRY Nice meeting you, Charley. (his voice suddenly dripping with double \nENTENDRE) See you soon. And unseen by Judy, he looks directly at Charley and winks at him. Charley whirls, bolting out of room and pounding up the stairway out of sight. Judy turns to Jerry. \nJUDY You know, our town really isn't'as boring as I make it sound. For instance, there's a dance at the church the first Friday of every month. \nJERRY \nReally? \nJUDY \n(BIG SMILE) \nReally. Jerry smiles a secret smile and takes a sip of his drink. \n39 INT.

But I do. Because I know they exist. I have faced them inn. all their guises, men, wolves, bats. And I have always won. That's why they call me The Great Vampire Killer. \n(DRAMATIC PAUSE) Now, watch me do it -- The horror flick comes back up on the screen, a much younger Peter stalking Dracula through a drafty castle, stake and mallet in hand. Charley watches the movie with renewed, if not fervent interest, whispering to himself as he watches. \nCHARLEY Get him, Peter,. get him -- \nDISSOLVE TO: \n60 OMITTED \n61 EXT. STUDIO PARKING LOT - DAY \nPeter comes out of the studio dressed in his street clothes, moping toward his car, taking a cigarette from his cigarette case as he goes. Eels in his fifties, tall, saturnine, by nature very theatrical, but at this particular moment in time, also very depressed. Charley jumps out from hiding and hurries toward him. \nCHARLEY Hey, Mr. Vincent -- Peter ignores him, continuing to walk-toward his car as. Charley falls in beside him. \nCHARLEY Could I talk to you a minute? (nothing from Peter) Please, Mr. Vincent, it's terribly important. Peter, abruptly stopped, resigned to the fact that boy is not going to let him alone. He whips out a fountain pen. \nPETER All right, what do you want me to sign? \nCHARLEY \n(CONFUSED) Pardon me? \nPETER Well, you want my autograph, don't you? \n(CONTINUED) \n61 CONTINUED: \nCHARLEY No, sir. I was curious about what you said last night on TV. You know, about believing in vampires. \nPETER What about it? \nCHARLEY Were you serious? \nPETER Absolutely. Unfortunately none of your generation seems to be. \nCHARLEY What do you mean? \nPETER (venting his frustra- tion on Charley) That I have been fired because no one wants to see vampire killers anymore. Or vampires either. Apparently all they want are demented madmen running around in ski masks hacking up young virgins. Now if'you'll excuse me -- Be starts for his car again, Charley falling in beside him. \nCHARLEY i believe in vampires. \nPETER \n(HARDLY LISTENING) That's nice. If only there had been more of you perhaps my rating would have been higher., \nCHARLEY In fact I have one living next door. Would you help me kill him ? That stops Peter cold. He turns and stares at the boy. \nPETER Pardon me? \nCHARLEY You know the murder of that girl that happened yesterday? \nPETER Yes. \n(CONTINUED) \n61 CONTINUED: (2) \nCHARLEY Well, the'guy who lives next door did it and he's a vampire. A moment. Then Peter turns away angrily. \nPETER If this is your idea of a joke, I am not amused. \nCHARLEY \n(GRABBING HIM) Mr. Vincent, I'm not joking. I'm deadly serious. Peter stares at him, sees he means it, and decides Charley's crazy. It makes him decidedly nervous. \nPETER - I'm sorry, you'll have to excuse me -- \n", "test2_true": "TRUTH -- Peter stops before his car, on outrageous old clunker, and fishes out his keys. \nCHARLEY You just said you believe in \nVAMPIRES -- \nPETER \n(SHARPLY) I' lied. Now leave me alone. He opens the door only to have Charley slam it shut, star- ing at Peter desperately. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 \nCHARLEY Please, you have to listen to me. The vampire tried to kill me last night-and trashed mv car when he didn't succeed. He'll be coming back for me tonight and if I don't get help, he's going to kill me -- Peter shoves him aside,\u00e2\u0080\u00a2hopping into his car, quickly lock- ing the door behind him, obviously terrified of Charley. As he starts the engine, Charley beats on the window. \nCHARLEY Mr. Vincent, you've got to believe \nINC -- \n(CONTINUED) \n61 CONTINUED: (3) Peter backs up, hauling ass out of the lot, Charley running after him.' \nCHARLEY Mr. Vincent He comes to a halt, realizing its useless, standing there .watching as Peter disappears out of the lot and down the street. \nCUT TO: \n62 OMITTED \n63 EXT. BREWSTER HOUSE - DAY \nAmy rides up on her moped just as Evil Ed starts.up the front walk toward Charley's house. She dismounts, looking at him. \nAMY What are you doing here? \nEVIL ED Me? What about you? I thought you just dumped him. \nAMY (hurrying up the walk) What I'm doing here is-none of your business. \nEVIL ED (hurrying after her) Aha, you do like him!

The window is nailed shut,. strands of garlic, a dozen at least, hung from the curtains. Dime store crosses and cru- cifixes are everywhere,, in every imaginable shape and size. Charley sits. in' the middle of the floor, whittling a stake from a slat of grape fence, a hammer by his side. \nEVIL ED \n(STARING AROUND) What's all this for? \nCHARLEY Self-defense. Not that I think I'll need it. He'll be dead before nightfall. \nAMY (exchanging.: worried glances with Evil. Ed) Who will be? \nCHARLEY Dandrige. I'm waiting for the guy he lives with to leave, then I'm doing to go next door, find his coffin, and pound this through his heart. He holds up the stake. Evil Ed and Amy look at it, hor- rified. \nAMY That's murder, Charley. \nCHARLEY (looking back at her with total seriousness) You can't murder a vampire, Amy. They're already dead, remember. \nAMY Charley, you're acting crazy. \nCHARLEY I don't have any choice, Amy.

Another body of a young woman was discovered early this morning in back of the Sheraton Mall -- He hits the stop button and turns back to them. \nCEARLEY See. After he attacked me last night he went out and had his dinner. (turning to stare out the window at the Dandrige house again) No, I- don't have any choice. Somebody has to stop him. Hold.on, I need \nANOTHER STAKE He rises and disappears out the door into the hall. Evil Ed turns to Amy, truly frightened for the first time. He whispers to her. \nEVIL ED What are we going to do? if we don't stop him he's actually going to try to kill this guy. \n(REALLY HORRIFIED) With a stake through the heart! \nAMY I know, I know -- \nEVIL ED I don't believe this. It's like Fright Night. \nAMY (her eyes lighting up) That's it! \n-EVIL ED What? \nAMY We get Peter Vincent to prove to him that this Dandrige guy isn't a vampire. \nEVIL ED (shocked by the \nSUGGESTION) How are we going to do that? \n(CONTINUED) \nbi Rev. 10/9/84 40. \n65 CONTINUED: (3) \nAMY I don't-know, but we better figure out a way if we don't want to be visiting Charley in jail. Charley enters from the hall, carrying another slat of wood to be sharpened. Evil Ed and Amy fall silent as he takes his seat by the window and goes back to his whittling. \nAMY (nervously clearing her \nTHROAT) Charley, .it's going to be dangerous doing into that house alone, isn't it? \n(CHARLEY NODS) You're going to need all the help you can get, right? Somebody like Peter Vincent for instance. \nCHARLEY I told you, I already tried him. \nAMY Why not let us try before you do anything? \nCHARLEY Why should he believe you anymore than he did me? \nAMY Maybe we're better talkers. \nCHARLEY Fat chance. \nAMY What happens if you go into that house alone and he gets you? Who's going to stop him then? \nEVIL ED \n(JOINING IN) Yeah, then he'll be able to suck his way through this entire town.

They're bills and more bills, many marked \"Last Notice\", one of them an order to vacate this apartment within three days for failure to pay rent. Suddenly there is a KNOCK at his door and he goes wearily to answer it.

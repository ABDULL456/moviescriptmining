{"train": "FRIGHT NIGHT \nWritten by \nTom Holland \nFINAL DRAFT Sep 6th, 1984 \nFADE IN: \nEXT. FULL MOON - NIGHT (AND CREDITS. ROLL) \nClouds obscure the starless heavens for a moment, heavy and ominous in the black firmament. Then suddenly they clear, exposing a full moon streaked with red like a killer's face, a stalking moon staring down at man's evil on the earth below. A HOWL breaks the night, a wolf pursuing its prey perhaps, or perhaps something much, much worse. VOICES break the perfect stillness. \nJONATHAN (V.0.) What was that? \nMISS NINA (V.0.) Just a child of night, Jonathan. Come, sit here beside me on the veranda. \nJONATHAN (V.0.) It's chilly out here. \nMISS NINA (V.0.) Oh, no, it isn't. It's beautiful. I love the night so. \n2 EXT. RANCHO CORVALLIS - NIGHT \nA middling size town lost somewhere in the Southwest, the lights of its sixty some thousand residents twinkling like so many Christmas lights in the night. \nJONATHAN (V.0.) I've never seen you so beautiful before, Nina. So pale, so luminescent, so He suddenly stops. There is a moment. Then: \nMISS NINA (V.0. ) Yes? \nJONATHAN (V.0.) Your lips are so red. \nMISS NINA (V.O.) Are they? Would you like to kiss them? The CAMERA STARTS TO PUSH IN CLOSER AND CLOSER on the town as though searching for the source of the voices. \n3 EXT. CHARLEY'S STREET - NIGHT \nIt's a typical middle class suburban street, full of pre- 1 World War II houses, the substantial places they built then, two and three story homes with attics and basements., porches and detached garages. There is the SOUND OF A LONG DRAWN OUT KISS as Jonathan and Miss Nina's lips meet. The CAMERA. MOVES DOWN the street, still looking for the voices. \n4 EXT. DANDRIGE AND BREWSTER HOUSE - NIGHT \nV The CAMERA PAUSES TO STARE AT the Dandrige house, so dif- ferent in look and feel from all the other houses on the street. It's huge, almost forboding, its windows dark and vacant, its lawn overgrown and weed-infested, a home that has obviously been untended for a long time, unlived in and uncared for. However the \"For Sale\" on the lawn has a \"Sold\" sign just beneath it. The CAMERA PANS to the Brewster house next door, still SEARCHING for those voices. It's in sharp contrast to the Dandrige house, newly painted, its lawn neatly shorn, a house almost dwarfed in comparison to the Dandrige house, but a happy home, its windows lit and smiling out warmly at the night. The voices seem to be coming from the Brewster house, spe- cifically from a dark second-story window that is open to the night breeze. \nJONATHAN (V.0.) Why are you looking at me so strangely, Nina? \nMISS NINA (V.0.) Not you, Jonathan. Your neck. Has anyone ever told you it was beautiful? \nJONATHAN (V.O. ) \n(UNCERTAINLY) No. \nMISS NINA (V.0.) Come, lay your head on my breast. The CAMERA SLOWLY STARTS TO PUSH IN on the second-.story window. \n5 OMITTED \n6 INT. BREWSTER HOUSE - CHARLEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThe CAMERA MOVES THROUGH the window, past the billowing drapes to find itself staring at a TV, the flickering screen the only light in the room. \n(CONTINUED) \n6 CONTINUED: One of those terrible AIP/Hammer horror films is on the tube, a woman, obviously a vampire, talking to one of those vapid juveniles used so much in these types of films, the two of them standing on a veranda to some huge, old house. The young man rests his head against her breast, incredibly enough, unaware that she is bending toward his neck with these huge fangs. Just as. she is about to sink them into his jugular, a tall, saturnine man steps out of the darkness., wearing a rather daffy Victorian suit and carrying a stake and mallet in his hand. His name is PETER VINCENT. \nPETER (V.0.) Stop, you creature of the Night! The vampiress leaps to her feet, her hapless, intended victim forgotten. She faces Peter with a, hiss, her fangs sparkling in the moonlight. \nMISS NINA (V.O.) Who are you who interrupts my nightly feeding? \nPETER (V.O.) (drawing himself up to his full height) Peter Vincent, vampire killer! He rushes her, the stake held high to plunge into her breast and the CAMERA TURNS AWAY from the TV as the sounds of the movie CROSS FADE with the SOUNDS OF HEAVY BREATHING, LIPS MEETING, TONGUES INTERTWINING in the room itself. Only the room, a typical teenager's lair, seems devoid of life, the bed empty, schoolbooks untouched sitting on the desk. The CAMERA BEGINS TO SEARCH the room, looking for the source of this new sound, much more interesting than the old flick on the tube. And then it finds them, CHARLEY BREWSTER and AMY PETERSEN, two sixteen-year olds, on the floor to the far side of the bed, wedged between the bed and the window. They are both as American as their jeans and making out like crazy. They twis.t and turn on the floor, Amy alternating between enjoy- ing it and fighting Charley off, both of them white hot with their mutual need. As he tries to slip his hand under her blouse, she catches-a glimpse of the TV. The horror movie has faded out to be replaced by the interior of a local TV studio, a tacky graveyard set the centerpiece, the visage of Peter Vincent, much older now, rising out of a papier mache coffin and filling the screen as CREDITS END. \n(CONTINUED) \nRev. 11/16/84 4. \n6 CONTINUED: (2) \n8 INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nJUDY Have you two been having a lovers' spat? \nCHARLEY \n(embarrassed as hell) No, Mom, nothing like that. \nJUDY Well, there's nothing wrong with that. (pointing at the maga- zine in her lap) Right here it says the divorce rate is 76% higher among couples who don't argue before marriage. \nCHARLEY \nMom, we're in high school. \nJUDY Oh, yes, that's right. Well it never hurts to-plan ahead. \n(TO AMY) Tell your mother I said hello, will you, Amy. And remind her we're playing bridge at her house this week. I'm bringing the cheesepuffs, she's making the dessert. \n(CONTINUED) \nch Rev. 12/4/84 7A. \n8 CONTINUED: \nAMY Yes, Mrs. Brewster. \n(TO CHARLEY) Good night, Charley. \nCHARLEY- \n(ABSENTLY) \nYeah, goodnight. But he's no longer listening; he's moving toward the window that stares out at the house next door. There are lights on in the first floor.now. Behind him Amy turns back to his mother. \nAMY \nWell, good night, Mrs. Brewster. \nJUDY Good night, Amy. And thanks for helping Charley. \nAMY Anytime. See you tomorrow, Charley. Be hardly hears her, staring out the window. Miffed again, Amy turns and stomps out of the room, the front DOOR heard SLAMMING behind her a moment later. \n(CONTINUED) \nI \n8 CONTINUED: Judy turns to her son to see what's wrong with him. He's glued to the window, staring at the house next door. \nJUDY Charley, that wasn't very nice, not walking Amy to the front door. \nCHARLEY (hardly hearing her) Mom, there are people. next door. \nJUDY Oh, the new owner must.be moving in. \nCHARLEY What new owner? \nJUDY I Didn't I tell you? Bob Hopkins told me he finally sold the place. \nI \nCHARLEY To who? \nJUDY I.d.on't know. Some fellow who fikes up houses, he said. Supposed to be attractive, too. Anyway I just hope whoever he is, he knows what he's getting into with that house. It's going to take a lot of work just to make it liveable -- And the CAMERA leaves them behind, SLOWLY PUSHING IN TIGHTER AND TIGHTER on the TV Judy was watching, their VOICES FADING out to be taken over by the newscaster dron- ing away on the screen. \nNEWSCASTER (V.0.) And now for the local news. A man was found murdered tonight behind the railroad yards. Details are pending waiting notification of next of \nKIN -- \nFADE TO BLACK. \nFADE IN. ON : \n9 INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HALL - DAY \nAMY (blocking his path) Charley, you can't go to the police with a story like that. They'll lock you up. \nCHARLEY All right, then I won't tell them it's a vampire. But I sure as hell am going to tell them about the two women -- \nAMY \nCHARLEY -- Be slams out the back door, leaving her staring after him, ) T worried sick. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n24A EXT. DANDRIGE HOUSE - DAY \nA police car pulls up, Charley in a red Mustang behind him. He gets out, walking to meet LIEUTENANT DETECTIVE LENNOX, a tall man in his early.forties. He hitches his pants, staring at the teenager hard. \nLENNOX You sure about this now? Charley nods emphatically and the cop turns toward the house, Charley following. \n25 OMITTED \n27 INT. DANDRIGE HOUSE - PORTICO - STAIRWAY - DAY \nThe KNOCK reverberates through the silent house. Nothing for several seconds; then the sound of someone walking down the hall from the kitchen. Billy Cole appears, stopping before the door, staring through the curtain at the dim outline of Charley and the Detective standing on the porch. He opens the door, staring at the boy and the cop. \nBILLY Yes. \n(CONTINUED) \nRev. 11/26/84 \n27 CONTINUED: \nLT. LENNOX Mr. Dandrige? \nBILLY ' No, I'm his roommate,\u00e2\u0080\u00a2Billy Cole. \nLT. LENNOX (flashing his badge) Lieutenant Lennox, homicide. Mind if we come in? \nBILLY No, not at all. He steps back from the door, allowing them to enter. The house is a mess of cardboard moving boxes and heavy Victorian furniture scattered everywhere, a number of the pieces still under white dust covers. Clocks line one wall, none of them working, all set at 6 p.m. \nBILLY Is there anything I can help you with? \nLIEUT. .LENNOX There was a murder last night. Charley lives'next door and thinks he saw the victim in this house. \nBILLY \n(SEEMINGLY SHOCKED) That's impossible. I was here with Jerry all last night. There was nobody else in the house. \nCHARLEY That's a lie. (nodding at Billy) I saw him carry her body out in a plastic bag. \nLIEUT. LENNOX What do you say to that, Mr. Cole? \nBILLY \n(RELIEVED) The kid's crazy, officer. I did take some bags out last night, but they were full of trash. Here, let me show you -- \n28 INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY \nHe leads them into the living room which is'a mess of pack- ing crates, boxes, and furniture. He holds up a plastic trash bag stuffed with wrapping paper and cardboard boxes. \n(CONTINUED) \nch Rev. 12/4/84 20. \n28 CONTINUED: 28 \nBILLY See. We're just in the process of moving in -- \nCHARLEY, The bag I saw had a body in it, not trash. \nI \nBILLY Did you actually see the body, Charley? \nCHARLEY No, but --. \nEVIL ED Far be it from me to turn down a fool's money. Where and when do you expect this vampire to attack? \n(CONTINUED) \npk Rev. 11/6/84 24. \n32 CONTINUED: (2) \nCHARLEY In my bedroom. Tonight. Evil Ed puts down his brush and pulls a dime store cross from his desk. He hands it to-Charley. \nEVIL ED Start with this. Of course, you have to have faith for it to work. Then get some wolfbane -- \nCHARLEY What? \nEVIL ED Forget it. Get some garlic, links of the stuff you can wear around your neck and hang from your window. If he comes for you,, that'll be the way. Then, of course, there's holy water. But you need a priest to say a blessing over it first. He goes back to his painting. Charley stares at him. \nCHARLEY That's all? \nEVIL ED 'I'm afraid so. Of course, they can change into wolves and bats at will and I don't know what you do about that. But your best protection right now is that a vampire can't enter your house without being invited by the rightful owner first. \nCHARLEY You sure about that? \nEVIL ED Positive. \nSMASH CUT TO: \n33 OMITTED \nTHRU \n36 INT. CHARLEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nCharley steps back to stare at his window, finished at last. Be's done the best he can, nailing-it shut, strewing it with garlic, his chest of drawers shoved in front of it, partially blocking. it. \n(CONTINUED) \nA \n36 CONTINUED: The cross Evil Ed gave him sits on his desk. He tests the window. It's secure. His mother calls up to him from the portico below. \nJUDY (O.S.) Charley, come down here, please. There's someone I want you to meet. He turns and walks out of the room, feeling better now. \n37 \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 INT. PORTICO - STAIRWAY - NIGHT \nHe bounces down the stairs and turns toward the door to the living room. \n38 INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nHe walks into the living room to find his mother standing there, a drink in her hand. \nCHARLEY Yeah, Mom -- \nJUDY Charley, this is.our next door neighbor, Jerry Dandrige. Charley freezes. Jerry Dandrige sits in the best chair, a drink in his hand, smiling at Charley. He's even better looking close up, almost blindingly beautiful, too much so actually. There's something disturbing about it, as though such good looks have to cover up an inner putrefaction, some sort of hidden, sweet, sickly rot just beneath the perfect pale skin. He rises, the smile widening as he sees the terror in Charley's eyes. He holds his hand out as Judy watches her son for his reaction. \nJERRY Hello, Charley. Charley just stares at him. \nJUDY Well, shake hands, Charley. There's no reason to be rude. Charley slowly crosses to Jerry and takes his hand, shaking it as one would the hand of a recently disinterred corpse. Judy.smiles, pleased with herself. \n(CONTINUED) \n38 CONTINUED: \nCHARLEY \nWhat's he doing here? \nJUDY (rising and smiling \nAT JERRY) I invited him over for a drink. \nCHARLEY (stone cold horrified) You what? \nJUDY (a bit taken aback by the intensity of her \nEVIL ED (V.0.) You still have my'cross? \nCHARLEY Yeah, and I nailed my.window shut. \nEVIL ED ' (V .0 . ) Then relax. There's no way he can get to you. \nCHARLEY You sure? \nCUT BACK TO: \n42 INT. EVIL ED'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nEVIL ED Positive. Now good night. I've got some studying to do. He hangs up, returning to painting his monster model of the Ghoul, mumbling to himself. \nEVIL ED Fucking idiot. \nCUT BACK TQ: \n43. INT. CHARLEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nCharley-grabs the cross off his desk and nervously fingers it, turning to stare out his window at Jerry's window next door. The shade is pulled, but there's a light on behind it. It doesn't make Charley any less nervous. \nDISSOLVE: \n44 EXT...DANDRIGE AND BREWSTER HOUSE - NIGHT \nBoth houses sit quietly on the street, wrapped in the dark- ness of the night air. An ordinary enough image, two houses, sitting there, but there's something disturbing about it. After.a few seconds one realizes what it-is: the Dandrige house almost looks like it's about to pounce on its next door neighbor, the Brewster house. \n45 INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT \nJudy is sound asleep, a light breeze wafting the curtains. of her partially open window, sleeping mask over her eyes. \n46 INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL - NIGHT \nDarkness and silence, and nothing else but moonlight spill- ing through the window at the far end. \n47 INT.. CHARLEY' S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nHe sleeps fitfully in his chair, his door locked behind him, his window barricaded with his desk. \n48 INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL - NIGHT \nSuddenly the shadowy outline of.what might be a huge bat swoops past the window outside followed by the BEATING OF MIGHTY WINGS. A second later something is heard landing on the roof with a heavy THUD. \n49 INT. CHARLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT \nCharley sits bolt upright in his bed as he hears it, lis- tening hard. But now there's nothing but silence. He stares up at the ceiling, listening and waiting. Then he hears what SOUNDS LIRE FOOTSTEPS walking across the roof. And then silence again. Grabbing the cross and holding on to it tightly, he walks toward his door. \n50 INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT \nHe unlocks the door and pokes his head out, looking up and down the hall. Nothing. Then he hears it, a NOISE from the floor below. It sounds like fingernails scratching-. across glass. He tiptoes to the landing, staring down at the shadow enshrouded portico below. The NOISE IS LOUDER now, spookier, more insistent. Clutching his cross, he starts down the stairs. \n51 INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT' \nJerry Dandrige stands above Judy, staring down at her sleeping peacefully in her bed. The window behind him is now fully open. He glides across the room past Judy's bureau with her wigs sitting on it, past the wall mirror without leaving a reflection to mark his passing, and out the door with unnatural silence. \n52 INT. HALLWAY -.NIGHT \nJerry closes the door behind him, giving it a sharp tug that slightly dislodges it-from it hinges, wedging it..tight against the frame. It's something no man of ordinary strength could accomplish that easily. He turns away, gliding across the hall toward the open door to Charley's bedroom. \n53 INT. STAIRWAY - PORTICO - NIGHT \nCharley stands on the stairs, staring through the doorway into the living room. There is nothing but shadows in there. And then he sees it, the source of the scratching sound. \n(CONTINUED) \nch Rev. 12/4/84 30. \n53 CONTINUED: A tree branch, caressed by the wind, is slowly.moving back and forth across a pane of glass in one of the french doors to the patio. Relieved, Charley slips the cross into his pants pocket and turns, walking back up the stairs. \n54 INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT \nHe walks down the hall past his mother's bedroom, hardly giving it \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 glance as he disappears into his own room. \nch Rev. 12/4/84 34. \n59 CONTINUED: Charley straightens up, his gaze suddenly riveted to the screen. \nPETER (V.0.) But I do. Because I know they exist. I have faced them inn. all their guises, men, wolves, bats. And I have always won. That's why they call me The Great Vampire Killer. \n(DRAMATIC PAUSE) Now, watch me do it -- The horror flick comes back up on the screen, a much younger Peter stalking Dracula through a drafty castle, stake and mallet in hand. Charley watches the movie with renewed, if not fervent interest, whispering to himself as he watches. \nCHARLEY Get him, Peter,. get him -- \nDISSOLVE TO: \n60 OMITTED \n61 EXT. STUDIO PARKING LOT - DAY \nPeter comes out of the studio dressed in his street clothes, moping toward his car, taking a cigarette from his cigarette case as he goes. Eels in his fifties, tall, saturnine, by nature very theatrical, but at this particular moment in time, also very depressed. Charley jumps out from hiding and hurries toward him. \nCHARLEY Hey, Mr. Vincent -- Peter ignores him, continuing to walk-toward his car as. Charley falls in beside him. \nCHARLEY Could I talk to you a minute? (nothing from Peter) Please, Mr. Vincent, it's terribly important. Peter, abruptly stopped, resigned to the fact that boy is not going to let him alone. He whips out a fountain pen. \nPETER All right, what do you want me to sign? \nCHARLEY \n(CONFUSED) Pardon me? \nPETER Well, you want my autograph, don't you? \n(CONTINUED) \n61 CONTINUED: \nCHARLEY No, sir. I was curious about what you said last night on TV. You know, about believing in vampires. \nPETER What about it? \nCHARLEY Were you serious? \nPETER Absolutely. Unfortunately none of your generation seems to be. \nCHARLEY What do you mean? \nPETER (venting his frustra- tion on Charley) That I have been fired because no one wants to see vampire killers anymore. Or vampires either. Apparently all they want are demented madmen running around in ski masks hacking up young virgins. Now if'you'll excuse me -- Be starts for his car again, Charley falling in beside him. \nCHARLEY i believe in vampires. \nPETER \n(HARDLY LISTENING) That's nice. If only there had been more of you perhaps my rating would have been higher., \nCHARLEY In fact I have one living next door. Would you help me kill him ? That stops Peter cold. He turns and stares at the boy. \nPETER Pardon me? \nCHARLEY You know the murder of that girl that happened yesterday? \nPETER Yes. \n(CONTINUED) \n61 CONTINUED: (2) \nCHARLEY Well, the'guy who lives next door did it and he's a vampire. A moment. Then Peter turns away angrily. \nPETER If this is your idea of a joke, I am not amused. \nCHARLEY \n(GRABBING HIM) Mr. Vincent, I'm not joking. I'm deadly serious. Peter stares at him, sees he means it, and decides Charley's crazy. It makes him decidedly nervous. \nPETER - I'm sorry, you'll have to excuse me -- \n(SHOCKED AGAIN) You actually went to Peter Vincent? \n(CONTINUED) \nRev. 11/16/84 \n65 CONTINUED: (2) \nCHARLEY \n(NODDING) Yeah. Dandrige has got to be stopped. Listen. I just taped this. He hits the play button on his stereo Dolby TAPE DECK and a local RADIO NEWSCAST PLAYS back. over the speakers. \nNEWSCASTER (V..0. ) And now for the two o'clock news. Another body of a young woman was discovered early this morning in back of the Sheraton Mall -- He hits the stop button and turns back to them. \nCEARLEY See. After he attacked me last night he went out and had his dinner. (turning to stare out the window at the Dandrige house again) No, I- don't have any choice. Somebody has to stop him. Hold.on, I need \nANOTHER STAKE He rises and disappears out the door into the hall. Evil Ed turns to Amy, truly frightened for the first time. He whispers to her. \nEVIL ED What are we going to do? if we don't stop him he's actually going to try to kill this guy. \n(REALLY HORRIFIED) With a stake through the heart! \nAMY I know, I know -- \nEVIL ED I don't believe this. It's like Fright Night. \nAMY (her eyes lighting up) That's it! \n-EVIL ED What? \nAMY We get Peter Vincent to prove to him that this Dandrige guy isn't a vampire. \nEVIL ED (shocked by the \nSUGGESTION) How are we going to do that? \n(CONTINUED) \nbi Rev. 10/9/84 40. \n65 CONTINUED: (3) \nAMY I don't-know, but we better figure out a way if we don't want to be visiting Charley in jail. Charley enters from the hall, carrying another slat of wood to be sharpened. Evil Ed and Amy fall silent as he takes his seat by the window and goes back to his whittling. \nAMY (nervously clearing her \nTHROAT) Charley, .it's going to be dangerous doing into that house alone, isn't it? \n(CHARLEY NODS) You're going to need all the help you can get, right? Somebody like Peter Vincent for instance. \nCHARLEY I told you, I already tried him. \nAMY Why not let us try before you do anything? \nCHARLEY Why should he believe you anymore than he did me? \nAMY Maybe we're better talkers. \nCHARLEY Fat chance. \nAMY What happens if you go into that house alone and he gets you? Who's going to stop him then? \nEVIL ED \n(JOINING IN) Yeah, then he'll be able to suck his way through this entire town. Not that it would-be much of a loss. \nCHARLEY \n(SLOWLY) I don't know -- \n(CONTINUED) \nbl Rev. 10/9/84 41. \nAMY \n(LYING MIGHTILY) Oh, he did, Charley, he did. \nCHARLEY (looking at her) Honest? \nAMY \n(NODDING SOLEMNLY) Honest. \nCHARLEY \n(SLOWLY) Then maybe we it really have a chance to kill Dandrige tomorrow night. (tears welling up in his eyes) You two don't know what it's been like, knowing there's a vampire living next door and having no one believe me -- \nAMY \n(SOOTHINGLY) It's all right, Charley She takes him in her arms, holding him close as Evil Ed turns away in disgust, staring out the window at the dark- ened window next door. \n75 INT. DANDRIGE HOUSE - UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - NIGHT \nJerry sits in the dark, rocking back and forth in a chair, staring out the window into Charley's room, catching just the dim outlines of the three kids in the house next door. He smiles; if anybody saw the smile, they'd run screaming in the opposite direction. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nYl Rev. 11/23/84 48. \n76 EXT. DANDRIGE HOUSE - DUSK INTO NIGHT \nThe three teenagers, Charley, Evil Ed, and Amy, stand in front of the house waiting. Dusk is slowly gathering, the shadows lengthening as night closes about them. Charley glances nervously at his watch. \nCHARLEY 'It's six ten. He said he'd be here at six, right? \nEVIL ED Relax. He said he'd be here, he'll be here. Peter's old clunker appears around the corner. Amy is the first to see it. \nAMY Here he comes. The kids rush the car as Peter pulls up. \nCHARLEY Mr. Vincent, I can't tell you how much I appreciate this -- Peter slowly gets out of the car, stretching to his full height. He wears his vampire killer regalia, the Victorian suit, and carries a small leather satchel. There is some- thing truly majestic about him.. He looks down at Charley, laying it on. with a trowel. \nPETER Charley Brewster, I presume? (as Charley nods; Peter shakes his hand) Peter Vincent, vampire killer. And now down to business. Where is the lair of this suspected creature of the night? \nCHARLEY (pointing at the \nDANDRIGE HOUSE) There. \nPETER \n(STUDYING IT) Ah, yes, I see what you mean. There is a distinct possibility. He opens the satchel, withdraws a small crystal vial of water, slips it into his jacket pocket, closes the bag, and replaces it on the front seat of his car. He locks the car and turns back to the kids., straightening his shoulders. \nPETER Well, shall we? \n(CONTINUED) \nch Rev. 12/4/84 49. \n76 CONTINUED: \nCHARLEY Where're your stakes and hammer? \nPETER. I left them in my bag-. \nCHARLEY \n(HORRIFIED) You're not going in there without them? \nPETER I have to prove he's a vampire before I kill him, Charley. \nCHARLEY But I know he's a vampire. \nPETER But I am the one that has to know, Charley. This is holy water. If it touches him, he'll blister- and in this case I asked him to drink it while we all watched. He readily agreed. \nCHARLEY \n(SHOCKED) He did? \n(SOURLY) 1 Where do you keep your coffin? Or do you have more than one? \nPETER (a warning growl) \nCHARLEY -- \nJERRY \n(SMILING) It's all right, Mr. Vincent. I'm quite used to it by,now. As you may or may not know, Charley even brought the police over a few days ago. Peter, Amy, and Evil Ed all look at Charley, shocked. \nAMY Charley, you didn't. \nCHARLEY \n(ANGRILY) Damn right, I did; Only the cops .didn't believe me anymore than any of you. (back to Jerry) But you'll believe me in a few seconds. Mr. Vincent, give him the holy water. \nPETER \n(WARNING HIM) Charley, there's no reason to be rude about this -- \nPETER (raising a placating hand) It's perfectly all right, Mr. Vincent. Where is the, ah, holy water? \n(CONTINUED) \n78 CONTINUED: Peter withdraws the vial from his pocket. Jerry eyes it warily, staring at Peter, his voice suddenly heavy with double meaning. \nJERRY Are you sure that's holy water, Mr. Vincent? \nPETER (playing it up) Positive. I saw Father Scanlon bless it down at Saint Mary's myself. Jerry takes the vial from his-hand, pulling the stopper, and sniffing at it, for the first time nervousness creeping into his manner.. Charley sidles up to Amy, whispering in her ear as Jerry prepares to drink the water. \nCHARLEY Get ready to run. I'll protect you with this. He edges a cross out of his pocket, just giving her a glimpse of it. He glances up just as Jerry lifts his head back and. downs the contents of the vial in one swallow. He 1 7 7 turns to Peter triumphantly. \nJERRY There, satisfied? \nPETER Totally. \n(TO CHARLEY) Charley, you saw it. Are you convinced now that Mr. Dandrige isn't a vampire? Charley stares at Jerry and the vial, stunned almost into speechlessness. \nCHARLEY But, it can't be -- \nPETER You just saw it, Charley. You know as well as I do that no vampire could drink blessed water. \nCHARLEY Then it wasn't blessed! \nPETER \n(HUFF ILY) Are you calling me a liar, young man? \n(CONTINUED) \n78 CONTINUED: ( 2) Charley looks at Jerry. Jerry stares back at hire, smiling. Charley suddenly whips the cross out of his packet and holds it up. \nCHARLEY If he's not a vampire, then have him touch this? Jerry stiffens, his face losing its color, but none of the others notice. They're all looking askance at Charley. Peter steps up to the boy. \nPETER Charley, you've already made a fool of yourself once. There's no reason to compound the error. \n_ JERRY Yes, Charley, you've already.caused your friends quite enough pain. (his eyes burning into Charley, hammering the \nPOINT HOME) You don't want to cause them any more, do you? Charley sees.Dandrige\u00e2\u0080\u00a2coiling to . spring, Billy sliding into place blocking the doorway to the portico. The tension level in the room is suddenly unbearable. Peter, Amy, and Evil Ed are aware of it although they don't know the reason. Charley slowly edges the cross back into his pocket. \nCHARLEY No, no, of course not., \nJERRY And you're finally-convinced I'm not a vampire either,-correct? Their eyes lock; a moment passes. Then finally: \nCHARLEY Yes. Jerry smiles at him and the tension suddenly flows out of the room. Billy even smiles. Jerry steps forward, usher- ing them all toward the portico. \nJERRY Well, I'm glad that's all.settled. \n79 INT. PORTICO - NIGHT. \nThey all stop before the front door, Billy in the back- ground Jerry turns to Peter. \n(CONTINUED) \n(CONTINUED) \nyl Rev. 11/23/84 57A. \nBOA CONTINUED: \nBILLY (still at window) Well, at least they'll never believe the kid now. Jerry glances down and sees a sliver of mirror from Peter's cracked cigarette case at his feet. He picks it up, examining it. He casts no reflection in it. He holds it up for Billy to see. \nJERRY No? \n(RISING) Let's go. He grabs his leather jacket and moves- down the hallway toward the back door, Billy quickly following. \nSOB EXT. DANDRIGE HOUSE - STREET - NIGHT \nThe kids are walking down the street away from the Dandrige house, the CAMERA CRANING UP to FOLLOW them as they recede in the distance, the darkness slowly swallowing them up. \n(CONTINUED) \npk Rev. 11/16/84 58 \n80B CONTINUED: \nCHARLEY (turning to Amy and Evil Ed) Well, at least you two heard him. \nEVIL ED \nHeard who?- \nI \nCHARLEY \nPeter Vincent. He said Dandrige had no reflection. \nEVIL ED Probably just a trick of the light. \nCHARLEY (whirling on Amy) You felt how evil Dandrige was, didn't you, Amy? Remember the way he looked at you? \nAMY (confused by the \nMEMORIES) Yes, sort of -- \nEVIL ED (bored with it all) Oh, for Christ sake -- \nHe turns, about to duck between two houses. \nCHARLEY Where are you going? \nEVIL ED Rome. It's dinner time. \nCHARLEY Wait a minute. We walk Amy home first. \nEVIL ED Why? \nCHARLEY Because it's after dark, pencil.dick, and there's a vampire back there! Be points back at the Dandrige house. Evil Ed just stares at him. \nEVIL ED Oh, shit, Brewster, you're certifiable, you know that. \n(CONTINUED) \n58A. pk Rev. 11/16/84 \n80B CONTINUED: They all start down the street together again; growing smaller and smaller until they disappear into the darkness. \n81 OMITTED \nCUT TO: \n82 EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT \nThe town of Rancho Corvallis is middling size, perhaps a hundred thousand people. \n(CONTINUED) \nJERRY Hello, .Edward. Evil Ed turns with a scream to find Jerry standing right next to him. Almost insane with fear now, slobbering like a wounded animal, he backs away from the shadowy figure, hitting the corner and sliding to the cold pavement, almost curled up in a fetal ball, tears streaming from his eyes. Dandrige walks over to him, staring down with something like pity in his eyes. \nJERRY You have nothing to fear from me. (in a voice like honey) I understand what it's like, being different. Only they won't make fun of you anymore or beat you up. I'll see to that. All you have to do is take my hand. Evil Ed slowly looks up at him through his tear-stained eyes to see Jerry staring-down at him, his. hand outstretch- ed to.him, a slight smile on his face, gentle, seductive, beguiling. \nJERRY Here, Edward, take my hand. Evil Ed looks down at the hand outstretched to him. \n(CONTINUED) \nRev. 11/16/84 63. \n83C CONTINUED: It's beautiful, perfectly shaped with thin, elegant fingers, almost womanly, the nails impossibly long, perfectly shapped, tapering to five gleaming, razor sharp points. Evil Ed slowly reaches out and-takes the vampire's hand. Jerry smiles down at him and slowly leans down, lifting him up into the last embrace Edward Thompson will ever know. \n84 EXT. STREET - NIGHT \nCharley and Amy walk rapidly along a street, heading toward Amy's home. He casts a glance at her. \nCHARLEY How much further? \nAMY About ten minutes -- A DEATH RATTLE, long and-high-pitched, suddenly comes to them, ECHOING through the city streets, down alleyways and across apartment buildings, faint yet filled with so much terror it stops them in their tracks and leaves them staring fearfully about at the shadows. \nCHARLEY What was that? \nAMY Evil Ed messing around. \n(SHOUTING) Not funny, Evil! Her voice bounces off the walls down the street and then dies, leaving them staring at the darkness and the shadows, fearful. Amy tries to act brave, turning to Charley. \nAMY \nC'MON -- They start down the street again, Charley glancing nervously over his. shoulder in the direction of Evil Ed's scream. \nCHARLEY Amy, what if Evil really was in trouble? \nAMY Oh, come on, Charley, don't let him suck you in again -- All the street lights suddenly go out, plunging them into almost total blackness. \n(CONTINUED) \nRev. 12/4/84 64. \n84 CONTINUED: They whirl, looking back down the now totally dark street, slowly backing away from the darkness. \nCHARLEY (to Army, in a \nHOARSE WHISPER) Don't tell me it's a power outage. \nAMY \n(EQUALLY SCARED) What else could it be -- 7 Charley stops, grabbing her, and nods to a light pole oppo- site them. She follows his gaze to see a power box on the pole, its front ripped open, the wires inside shredded.- Before they can even gasp at the sight, they hear the SOUND \nOF HUGE WINGS beating overhead.. A huge shadow of a bat flies across the building wall opposite them. That's all it takes; they whirl, dashing down the street. \n85 OMITTED \n87 EXT. ANOTHER STREET - NIGHT \nThey come-racing down a street, under a bridge and start up the incline toward the ROAR above. They turn onto the bridge, starting to.cross it., slowing to a walk, breathing hard. \nCHARLEY I think we lost him. \nAMY Yeah. (stopping and turning \nTO CHARLEY) Charley, you were right about the holy water. We faked it. I'm just sorry I didn't believe you. \nCHARLEY It's all right, Amy. He kisses her, takes her hand, and they start walking up the bridge. \nCHARLEY We've got it made And they freeze.' There, high above them on one of the arches of the bridge, so high up no one could possibly get there unless they flew, stands Jerry Dandrige, staring down at them. With a scream, they whirl, racing off the bridge and down the street. \n(CONTINUED) \npk Rev. 11/16/84 64A-. \n87 CONTINUED: They suddenly turn the corner only to find they are facing Jerry Dandrige, standing on the sidewalk directly in front of them, amused by the frozen expressions of horror on their faces. \nCHARLEY- Run? He grabs Amy's hand, the two of them whirling and dis- appearing around the street corner. \nThere is a KNOCK at Peter's locked and barred door. He slowly rises from his chair, the cross clenched in his hand, staring at it, terrified. The KNOCKING COMES.AGAIN, louder this time. He presses his lips to the door, whis- pering. \nPETER Who is it? \nEVIL ED Me, Evil Ed. \nPETER What do you want? \nEVIL ED There's a vampire out here. Let me in. Peter slips the cross into his pocket and unlocks the door. Be pulls Evil Ed into the room, hurriedly locking and bar- ring the door behind him. Evil Ed has changed, and not for the better. His skin is more sallow, huge dark circles under his eyes, his lips bloodless, his collar pulled up tightly around his neck. Peter turns to him. \nPETER What are we going-to do? \nEVIL ED What are you going to do, not me. Peter stares at him as Evil Ed slowly reaches up and pulls down the collar of his shirt, revealing two small puncture marks on his throat. Peter's eyes widen in horror; Evil Ed's smile only grows wider. \nEVIL ED I used to admire you, you know that. Of course, that was before I found out what \u00e2\u0080\u00a2a fake you were. \n(CONTINUED) \n94A CONTINUED: He advances on Peter, looming over him, Peter staring up at the boy in growing terror. Evil. Ed smiles at him, reveal- ing two huge fangs. Peter leaps out of the chair, dashing for the door, fumbling to undo the locks and bars with trembling fingers. Evil Ed watches, his rictus grin just growing wider. \nEVIL ED Peter Vincent, the great vampire killer, indeed! He throws himself at Peter, grabbing him from behind and whirling him about, opening his mouth wide to sink his fangs into him. Peter straightens, grabbing the cross from his pocket and thrusting it directly into Evil Ed's face, slamming it into his forehead between his eyes. His skin sizzles and cracks, smoke rising, and Evil Ed backs away, bent over screaming in pain, his hands held to his face. He slowly looks up as Peter watches, frozen in horror. Evil Ed drops his hands from his face, revealing a smoking sign of the cross branded into his forehead. He stares at Peter. \nEVIL ED What have you done to me? He turns to look into the wall mirror, but there's no re- flection.for him to see. He whirls on Peter, screaming at him like the spoiled brat he is. \nEVIL ED What have you done to me? He takes a step toward Peter and Peter thrusts the cross at him. \nPETER Back. \nEVIL ED The master will kill you for \u00e2\u0080\u00a2this. And not fast, slowly, oh, so slowly -- Peter advances on him, the cross held out in front of him with shaking hands, backing Evil Ed across the room toward the window. \nPETER Back, I say, back -- \n(CONTINUED) \npk Rev.. 11/16/84 69. \n94A CONTINUED: (2) Evil Ed snarls at him. like some trapped feral animal and suddenly whirls-, throwing himself headlong out the window in an EXPLOSION OF SHATTERING GLASS. Peter rushes to the window, staring out at the street below. Nothing. He cranes his-'neck peering at the heavens above. Nothing. He draws his head back in, leaning against.the wall, gasping for breath, on hand on his heart, feeling it about to leap out of his chest with the horror of it all. \nCUT BACK TO: \n94B INT..CLUB RADIO - NIGHT I \nCharley slams the phone back into its cradle in frustra- I tion, Amy looking at him worriedly. \nCHARLEY He doesn't believe me. \nAMY (sinking back against the wall in defeat) I'm scared, Charley. I'm real scared. \nCHARLEY I won't let him get you, Amy. I promise. \nAMY We haven't got a chance, Charley. Not the two of us against him! What about your mother? Call her. \nCHARLEY She can't handle this, Amy. \n(SUDDENLY) You got Peter Vincent's number? \nAMY Oh, Charley, he doesn't care about us, I paid him to be there today. \nCHARLEY We don't have-any choice, Amy. Now give me his number. She reluctantly digs a scrap of paper out of her pocket as Charley drops another dime. \nCUT TO: \n94C CONTINUED: \nJERRY (a growl of inhuman \nRAGE) What? His hand snaps out, grabbing Evil Ed and jerking hin for- ward into the spill of light from the overhead street lamp. ' The sign of the cross is clearly seen on his forehead. Jerry stares at it in revulsion. \nJERRY What is that? \nEVIL ED \n(CRYING PITEOUSLY) He had a cross -- \nCharley slams the phone down, turning to Amy. \nCHARLEY God damn him. He-won't help us -- -Only Amy is gone, the hallway empty. Charley rushes toward the dance floor. \n101 INT. CLUB RADIO - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT \nCharley emerges from the hall, looking about in the crush of people for Amy. Nothing; it's as if she's disappeared into thin air. He plunges out into the crowd. \n(CONTINUED) \nA \ngr Rev. 11/26/84 73. \n101 CONTINUED: In another part of the bar area Charley moves among the people, desperately searching for Amy. He passes the drunken teenagers, ignoring them as he suddenly bumps into a table, a man yelling up at hiXi angrily. \nCORE USER Hey, watch out,.asshole! Charley glances down to see the table of users grouped around their mirror of white powder. He moves quickly away, searching for Amy. He stops by the wall of poseurs cruising everything that walks by, asking a girl that looks from behind as though she must be Amy's age. \nCHARLEY Pardon me, have you seen a girl, \nLIGHT-HAIRED -- \n(CONTINUED) \npk Rev. 11/16/84 74. \n101 CONTINUED: (2) The girl turns to him,. revealing herself as a woman well into her mid-forties, decked out like a teenager, Sylvia Miles ten years ago, staring at him hungrily. \nOLDER WOMAN Forget her, take me instead She reaches out to kiss Charley and he flees the crowd of flesh.watchers laughing at him as he goes. He moves along a wall of LESBIANS, stopping one, his des- peration growing. \nCHARLEY I'm looking for a girl -- \nLESBIAN So am I. Before Charley can recover a woman moves into her arms, Charley, shocked and disconcerted, backing away until he bumps to a halt against a heavy metal biker, the kind of guy who's into Twisted Sister. The parody of biker throws him to the floor for the insult, his friends, walking par- odies of bikers, laughing at Charley as he leaps to his feet and backs away into the crowd. He breaks free of the packed humanity, stopping on the stairs. It is at that moment that he catches a glimpse of Amy on the dance floor, dancing with Jerry. He hurries down the stairs and onto the floor. On the dance floor, Amy moves.with Jerry, their bodies locked together, slowly falling. into his eyes, dancing slower and slower with him until finally she has no will left of her own. She is \"in love\" with him. It is at that moment that she bends her head forward, laying it on his shoulder, exposing her neck to him, her eyes staring at the wall as they revolve around and around, Jerry bending down to kiss her neck, his mouth slowly opening. It is at that moment Amy sees her reflection in the mirrors mounted against one wall;.she is dancing alone. Shocked back to her senses, she goes rigid in Jerry's arms, trying to pull away from him, screaming as the music and the dancers stop. \n'AMY Charley! Across the dance floor, Charley hears her SCREAM and pushes his way through the sea of humanity, fighting his way to her side where she stands with Jerry, once again caught in his eyes, slowly losing her will. Charley grabs Jerry by the shoulder, trying to pull him away from Amy. \n(CONTINUED) \npk Rev. 11/16/84 74A. \n101 CONTINUED: (2A) \nCHARLEY Let her go! Jerry looks down at him, smiling, mocking him as Amy sways in his arms, her eyes locked on. his face. \nJERRY What's wrong, Charley? Jealous? He grinds his pelvis against.Amy, dry humping her in front of Charley. She throws her head back, her mouth opening in .something close to ecstasy, her eyes glazed, staring up at him with adoration, giving herself to him as she cocks her head to one side, exposing her tender young throat. Charley goes crazy. \nCHARLEY You filthy son-of-a-bitch -- ! He swings at him only to have Jerry release Amy, catching Charley's fist in the palm of his hand easily. Be stares down at the boy, smiling cruelly. \n.JERRY You shouldn't lose your temper, Charley. It isn't polite. He tightens his grip, slowly squeezing Charley's fist. You can almost hear the knuckle bones grinding as Charley's face'contorts in agony, driving him to his knees before Jerry. Charley looks up at him, tears of pain streaming down his face. \nCHARLEY (gasping with pain) You can't kill me here -- \nJERRY I don't want to kill you, Charley. I -want you to bring Peter Vincent to my house, just the two of you. That is if you ever want to see Amy again. He casually releases Charley, letting the boy drop to the floor as he disappears with Amy into the swirling mass of dancers. Charley leaps to his feet, ignoring the pain in his hand and plunges after them. Charley breaks free of the swirl near the bar, looking everywhere and not seeing either of them. Suddenly he's grabbed by a strong, pair of arms. He looks up to find himself staring into the face of a huge, black BOUNCER. \n(CONTINUED) \npk Rev. 11/16/84 748. \n101 CONTINUED: (28) \nCHARLEY \n(DESPERATELY) Let me go -- The man ignores him, calling back over his shoulder. \nBOUNCER' Hey, Donny, this the one? Another huge bouncer, the one the cook talked to when Charley and Amy sneaked into the club, steps out of the whirl staring down at the boy. \nDONNY Yeah, its him. \n(TO CHARLEY) Where's your girlfriend? Charley suddenly sees Jerry and Amy breaking through the throng, heading for the entrance. He points to them wildly. \nCHARLEY That's her, over there with that older \nGUYF \nCHARLEY (grabbing the phone away from him) No, they won't believe you. I've tried. \n(CONTINUED) \nch Rev. 12/4/84 78. \n124 CONTINUED: 'Peter collapses in a chair, staring blindly ahead. \nCHARLEY \n(QUIETLY) Peter, it's just us. Were going to have to save Amy. \nPETER I can't. I was paid to be there today. \nCHARLEY I know. \nPETER And you still want me to help you? \nCHARLEY Yes. You're Peter Vincent, the Great Vampire Killer. \nPETER (looking up at him, \nFURIOUS) That's a character in a movie, .Charley. That's not even my real name! (repressing a sob) And I'm terrified, I'm sorry, but I am. \nCHARLEY I can't do it alone, Peter. If you don't help, Amy's going to die. And me, too, probably. r (nothing f om Peter) Please, Peter. \nPETER I'm sorry, Charley. \nCHARLEY (quietly, of ter a \nMOMENT) Yeah, me, too. He walks to the door, slipping quietly out of the apart- ment, leaving Peter staring miserable at the floor. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n125 INT. DANDRIGE HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nAmy slowly regains consciousness, opening her eyes to find herself laying on the floor, Jerry Dandrige looming over her. She cowers back, looking about the bedroom. \n(CONTINUED) \nbl Rev. 10/9/84 79. \n125 CONTINUED: \nAMY Where am I? \nJERRY Where you wanted to be. In bedroom. He reaches out a hand to her; she cowers back. \nAMY Liar. Where's Charley? \nJERRY You don't really care. He hits play on the TAPE DECK. FUNK ROCK, hot and driving, snakes out of the speakers. He turns back to her, holding out his hand. She looks away, then glances up only to find herself trapped in his gaze. He starts.to weave his way across the floor toward her,. every move a suggestion, an invitation, all of it somehow hypnotic. She stares at him, fighting to break free. Finally she manages to turn her head away, staring at the floor, screaming at him. \nAMY Liarl I love him... It doesn't faze him; he just keeps moving to the beat, slowly, oh, so slowly, coming closer and closer to where she sits on the floor, his voice stroking her as he comes. \nJERRY Am I lying, Amy? He stops above her, leaning down, his voice a husky, post- coital whisper. \nJERRY Am I? And she's gone, his eyes drawing her in and swallowing her up, drowning her in their faint red glow. He holds out his hand to her. She slowly takes it and-he raises her up into his arms, moving in place to the MUSIC with her, smiling down as she stares up at him blindly. He gently pushes her head down on his shoulder, exposing her tender young neck. And then he slowly bends down, his mouth opening to expose those two, razor sharp fangs with their alabaster cast, slowly, delicately sliding them beneath her skin. \n(CONTINUED) \nbf Rev. 11/28/84 80. \n125 CONTINUED: (2) Her body arches, both arms pressing him to her, her body clinging to his. And then she screams, bucking under him like she's having something like a sexual climax, only better, much better. And just underneath her scream.is this horrid, greedy, SUCKING NOISE, Jerry Dandrige, feeding. \nCUT TO: \n125A EXT. SIDE YARD OF A HOUSE - NIGHT \nCharley walks through the darkness, with cross and stake held in his hands, slowly approaching the Dandrige house through a side yard across the street. The shadows loom up over him, the wind causing the TREE BRANCHES to RUSTLE, Charley growing more and more nervous with every passing second. \n126 EXT. DANDRIGE HOUSE - NIGHT \n-Charley steps out of the darkness of the trees across the street from the Dandrige house, stopping to stare at it. The huge, silent, dark.house no longer looks like every other house on the block. It seems to have assumed a life of its own and turned into a hulking, brooding monster, about to leap forward and pounce on him. Charley grips his stake and hammer, checks the cross stuck in his jacket pocket, takes'a deep breath, squares his shoulders, and starts the slow walk toward the Dandrige house. Through the trees-he moves, into the shadows and darkness, across the street, closer and closer,to that hulking,, evil house. Suddenly a'hand snaps out of the darkness, grabbing him by the shoulder. \n8 2A. pk Rev. ll/I6/84 \n127C IT. HOUSE.- STAIRWAY - NIGHT { _ \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd?

Peter grabs Charley again, digging his fingers into the boy's arms, listening hard. \nPETER Let's wait until dawn. He'll be in his coffin then. We'll have a better chance of getting Amy. \n(CONTINUED) \nyl Rev. 11/23/84 83. \n127C CONTINUED: \nCHARLEY Amy'll be dead by then, too.

Peter whips out one of the crosses, thrusting it at the vampire. \nPETER (in his vampire killer \nVOICE) Back, spawn of Satan. \nJERRY Oh, really? He reaches out, takes the cross. from Peter's hand and crumples it, contemptuously tossing. it aside. Be turns back to Peter. \nJERRY You have to have faith in order for it to work on me, Mr. Vincent. He starts down the stairs again, Peter backing away, terrified, his nerve completely gone now. Charley steps forward, staring up at Dandrige defiantly. He whips out his cross, thrusting it at the vampire. \nCHARLEY Stop! Jerry stops, staring at the cross. Charley starts up the stairs toward him, the cross held in front of him. \n(CONTINUED) \nyl Rev. 11/23/84 - 84. \n127C CONTINUED: (2) \nCHARLEY \nBACK -- Jerry backs up the stairs, away from the cross, disappearing into the darkness at the top of the landing. Charley glances back at Peter triumphantly. \nCHARLEY We're gonna make.it -- Billy Cole suddenly steps out of the darkness in front of him, rips the cross from the boy's hand and viciously backhands him across the face. With a scream, Charley smashes through the. stairway railing, plunging to the hallway floor below. He lands with a solid thud, lying there, groaning. Jerry steps in front of Billy, staring down at Peter on the stairway, smiling at him. Then he slowly starts down the stairs toward Peter. With a scream, the actor whirls, racing down the steps and out the front door. \n128 INT. BREWSTER HOUSE - PORTICO - STAIRWAY - NIGHT \nPeter smashes through the front door, yelling up the stairway. \nPETER Mrs. Brewster! No answer. He grabs the phone from the table and punches out a number, speaking hurriedly into it. \nPETER Hello, operator, get me the police. Operator? No response, not even a dial tone. He holds the phone up only to see the cord has been ripped from the wall. His eyes widen in horror, his gaze snapping back up the stairs. PETER (Cont.) Mrs. Brewster -- He plunges up the stairs. \n129 INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT \nHe bursts through the door to see Judy in bed, the back of her head to him, her blond hair lying across the pillow.

Make as much noise as you can. Charley turns to the wall, beating on it and yelling for all he's worth. \nCHARLEY Help, let me out! \n138 INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT \nJerry and Billy are preparing a spare coffin for Amy, dumping dirt into it from the bottom of the huge, ornate coffin Charley saw them carrying into the house on that first night so long- ago. They pause in their work as they hear Charley's SCREAM DYING AWAY. Jerry smiles at Billy. \nJERRY I think she just opened her eyes. \n139 INT.

SIDE OF DANDRIGE HOUSE - NIGHT \nSUBJECTIVE CAMERA CRANES UP'off a basement window, up the side of the house past the living room window and up and up, the VOICES in Jerry's bedroom getting LOUDER and LOUDER as Jerry approaches. \nCHARLEY Are you sure? \nPETER So far everything's just like in the movies. We'll just have to keep on hoping. And the CAMERA STOPS outside the bedroom window, watch- ing as Charley grabs the stake Dandrige dropped on the floor, and heads for. the door. \n(CONTINUED) \npk Rev. 11/16/84 89A, \n141A CONTINUED: \nCHARLEY Let's go -- He and Peter hurry out the door, the CAMERA WATCHING them go. \n142 INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - STAIRWAY - NIGHT \nI They come out of the bedroom and start. down the steps only to find themselves facing Billy Cole coming up the other way. They freeze. as Billy stops, a slow smile sliding across his grim features. \n(CONTINUED) \nThe SUBJECTIVE CAMERA STARES in at them, then starts to move across the porch and up the side of the house as Charley speaks to Peter. \nCHARLEY What? The CAMERA PASSES Jerry's bedroom window, catching a glimpse of Peter on the balcony just as he replies to Charley. \nPETER I don't know. Just my nerves, I guess. \n151F INT. HOUSE - SECOND-FLOOR BALCONY - NIGHT \nBehind Peter there is suddenly a POUNDING at the attic door. Its Amy, trying to get out. Peter stares wor- riedly at the attic door as the POUNDING from within be- comes more VIOLENT. Suddenly ALL THE CLOCKS on the wall below GO OFF, signaling that it's 6 a.m., dawn, time for Jerry to go to bed. Peter takes his eyes off the clocks as the LAST CHIME DIES, looking at Charley over the Balustrade. \nPETER Keep searching for him. Se's got to be close. It's almost dawn. Charley heads back down the hallway toward the basement as above on the landing, Peter stares around, about to try another door when suddenly the huge stained glass window directly behind and above him bursts apart in an EXPLOSION OF SHATTERING GLASS and Jerry Dandrige plunges in from the outside, landing in a crouch before Peter. He rises as the. older man backs away. Charley rushes down the hail back into the portico, brought by the sound of the crash. He's about to start up the stairs when Dandrige turns and stares down at him. Charley ignores him, starting up the stairs. Peter speaks to him, never taking his gaze from Dandrige. \nPETER Stay there, Charley -- Charley freezes, staring up at the vampire and the man above, watching, waiting. Dandrige's gaze bores into Peter. \nJERRY So. Just the two of us at last. \n(CONTINUED) \ngr Rev. 11/26/84 99. \n151F CONTINUED: He-takes a step for Peter. Peter whips out a cross, thrusting it at him. Dandrige stops, smiling at him. He starts for him again, Peter holding his ground, the cross thrust out in front of hiin. \nPETER Back! \nJERRY \n(SMILING THINLY) You have to have faith for that to work, Mr. Vincent. Remember? Peter continues to hold his ground, the cross held up higher, staring defiantly back at Dandrige, refusing to drop his gaze. And then it happens: the vampire jerks to a halt, staring with slowly dawning fury at Peter, real- izing by whatever invisible force it is emanating from that cross that indeed Peter has recovered his faith. He stands there, stymied, snarling at the man. Peter peers over his shoulder, out the ruined window. On the horizon, the first pink tendrils of dawn are breaking. Now it's Peter's turn to smile as he shifts his gaze back to Dandrige. \nPETER Look over your shoulder. Dandrige cranes his neck to see the rising dawn through the open window, the sun beginning to glint its golden rays even as he stares at it. He turns back to Peter, roaring with fury. \nJERRY No! Peter picks up his stake and dives for the vampire, Dandrige is too quick for him. He throws himself off the landing, tucking his body into a somersault as he hurls through the air toward the portico floor below, turning into a whirling ball of spinning flesh only to suddenly emerge- from it no longer a man, but now an enormous bat. The' bat straightens in midair above the portico and zooms down the hallway, smashing into Charley chest high, blowing him off his feet as his claws rake the boy, sending two bloody furrows down his chest as the bat whips past him and disappears down the hallway into the darkness. \n(CONTINUED) \npk Rev. 11/16/84 99A. \n151F CONTINUED: (2) Peter recovers above, hurrying down the stairs to the portico below. He rushes to Charley's side, helping the badly shaken boy to his feet. \nPETER Are you all right? \nCHARLEY Yes. Amy begins POUNDING AT THE ATTIC DOOR. above again. The two men look up as it begins to splinter. \nPETER Quick, he's in the basement. He helps the boy. down the hall, the two of them disappear- ing through the basement door. A second later the attic DOOR above RIPS FROM ITS HINGES, CRASHING to the floor. Amy steps out of the attic, her eyes sightless, a stake grasped in her hand.' She walks like an automaton down the stairway toward the portico below.. \n152 INT. BASEMENT - DAWN \nCharley anaa$ Peter hurry down the stairs into the dark room, its windows covered with blackout drapes. The floor is a mass of antiques, row after row of them, many covered with dust cloths. Peter dives for the first one, ripping the cloth off only to discover an armoire. He rushes to the next one. \nPETER Quick, his coffin has to be here \nSOMEWHERE -- They race down the aisle continuing to rip dust covers away only to discover a line of mirrors, several of them obviously removed from pieces in the house above. They stop, staring at them. \nCHARLEY Well, now we know what he did with the mirrors -- The DOOR to the stairway- CREAKS open behind them, lost somewhere in the dark. Peter whirls, looking back the way they just came. \nPETER What was that? \n(CONTINUED) \nRev. 11/16/84 99B. \n152 CONTINUED: \n.CHARLEY \n(MOVING AWAY) You keep searching. I'll check it out. \nPETER \nCHARLEY But Charley has disappeared into the darkness before Peter can stop him. Charley appears down the row of antiques, stopping at the foot of the stairs and staring up at.the basement door above. It is partially open, allowing just a sliver of light into the darkness. He calls out, clutching his stake nervously. \nCHARLEY Who's there -- Amy appears out of the darkness behind him, slowly. approaching; her face deathly white, her lips blood red, her eyes almost glowing in the dark. He hears her at the last second, whirling to face her with a gasp. She reads the fear on his face and smiles sadly, reaching out a hand to him. \nAMY Don't be frightened, Charley. She takes a step closer and he steps away. Amy stops, staring at him; then she slowly begins to advance on him, unbuttoning her blouse, her voi ce a husky, purring whisper. \n", "test1_input": "AMY It was my fault, not yours. \nCHARLEY \n(REALLY STARTLED) It was? (she nods;.he recovers, taking her hand) Look, Amy, I. love you. I never.. want to fight with you again, okay? \nAMY (breaking into a big smile) God, I'm so glad we're getting this straightened out. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n13 CONTINUED: \nAMY (CONT' D) I've been miserable the last two days. You don't know what it's been \nLIKE -- Over her shoulder he suddenly sees that the TV has gone to the local news, a picture of a girl who looks very much like the one he saw going into the Dandrige house the afternoon before on the screen. He is suddenly no longer listening or looking at Amy, his complete attention on the TV. She trails-off as she realizes she's lost his atten- tion, staring at him. \nAMY Charley, are-you listening to me? He gets up abruptly and walks away, leaving her sitting there staring after him. He stops'below the TV, staring up at it as the newscaster's voice runs over the picture of the girl. \nNEWSCASTER (V.0.) \n(CAUGHT MID-SENTENCE) Cheryl Lane, a known prostitute, was found murdered this morning -- Evil Ed steps up beside him, staring up at the 'screen along with him. \nEVIL ED Know what I heard on the police band .last night? \nCHARLEY What? \nEVIL ED (nodding at the TV) That wasn't the only murder. It's the second in two days. \n(GLEEFULLY) And get this. Both of 'em had their heads cut off. Can you believe it? \nCHARLEY' (staring at him) You're sick. A voice suddenly comes from behind him. \nAMY (O.S.) Charley. \n(CONTINUED) \n16 EXT. BREWSTER AND DANDRIGE HOUSE - NIGHT \ntD The two houses sit there side by side,.only the Dandrige house has changed although it's hard to say exactly how. It just seems worse than before, more abandoned, more-hulk- ing, more... dead. \n17 INT. CHARLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT \nCharley has the house next door staked out. He sits in a chair before his window, all the lights off in his room, only the flickering TV to keep him company. It's Peter Vincent on Fright Night, another one of his films on, this time the volume turned off. Charley holds his binoculars in his hand, staring at the dark window of the house next door, waiting. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n18 ZNT. CHARLEY'S ROOM - MUCH LATER THAT NIGHT The TV is just flickering snow now, the channel having signed off hours before. Charley still sits in front of his window, but he's sound asleep, breathing deeply, lost in his dreams. Soft, sensual MUSIC snakes through his open window, enveloping him slowly and dragging him awake. Groggily he opens his eyes to find himself staring into the lit window of the bedroom next door. He sits up with a start. There is no drawn shade now. Be can see clearly into the room and a beautiful teenage girl with long blonde hair stands there, framed in the window, slowly taking her blouse off. Charley rubs his eyes., hardly able to believe what he's seeing. As he watches she drops the blouse to the floor and stands there, bare breasted. Charley gulps, fumbling for his binoculars. He gets them to his eyes just as Jerry Dandrige steps out of the shadows behind the girl, gliding across the room toward her with incredible grace. To Charley the whole thing has.a dreamlike quality, Jerry more an impression than a reality. He's thirty maybe, almost beautiful with alabaster skin and chestnut hair. He stops behind the girl, sweeping her hair back, exposing her tender, young neck. He slowly leans down as though to kiss her. As Charley watches through his binoculars, unable to tear his eyes away, Jerry Dandrige's upper lip slowly begins to pull back,. revealing just the hint of fangs, long, razor sharp, and sparkling pearly white in the moonlight. Suddenly, Jerry Dandrige stops, the fangs poised an inch above the girl's throat. He slowly raises his head, star- ing out the window across the side yard and into Charley's bedroom. \n(CONTINUED) \npk Rev. 11/16/84 15. \n18 CONTINUED: It's almost as though he can see the boy watching him. - With an involuntary gasp of terror, Charley steps back into the deeper darkness of his room, his hand instinctively reaching up to-protect his own throat. Jerry Dandrige\u00e2\u0080\u00a2slowly reaches up and pulls down the shade, cutting off all view into the room. Charley stands there for a moment, unable to believe what he just saw. The binoculars slip from his hand, crashing to the floor, and. he whirls, racing out of the room. \n19 INT. HIS MOTHER'S ROOM - NIGHT \nHe bursts through the door to find his mother sound asleep in bed. He grabs her, shaking her awake. \nCHARLEY Morn, you've yot to get up. I can't believe what s happening next door. \nJUDY (staring up as her son \nSLEEPILY) What, what are you talking about? \nCHARLEY He has fangs. The man who bought the house has fanas! \nJUDY Oh, Charley, I have to be at work at \nSEVEN TOMORROW He hears a CAR DOOR SLAM in the yard next door. He jumps to the window, peering out into the back of the Dandrige house just in time to see Billy Cole walking away from a shiny new black Cherokee Jeep, its back door left open. Charley whirls and dashes out of the room, leaving his mother staring after him. \nJT1DT \n", "test1_true": "20 EXT. SECOND FLOOR HALL - NIGHT \nHe races down the corridor for the stairway landing. \n21 INT. STAIRWAY - PORTICO-- NIGHT \nHe pounds down the stairs, taking'them two at a time, whips around the newel post and flies down the hall toward the kitchen. \n22 EXT. BACK YARD - DANDRIGE HOUSE - NIGHT \nCharley slips out his back door and through. the darkness into the adjoining yard. \n(CONTINUED) \n22 CONTINUED: .There, among a clump of bushes, he crouches down, watching the black Jeep. The rear door is open as though to receive some burden, the yard empty, Billy Cole no longer'there. Suddenly the back door to the Dandrige house opens again and Billy comes out carrying a large bundle in a plastic trash bag over his shoulder. 'Charley's mouth falls open as he realizes the bundle could'easily be a woman's dead body. Billy dumps it in the back of the Jeep and slams the door, crossing. in front of the vehicle for the driver's door. Suddenly there is a terrific WHOOSH'through the air over Charley's head, the moonlight momentarily blotted out, the BEATING OF LARGE WINGS above causing the bushes around him to bend and sway. It's almost as though a huge bird, a bat perhaps, just swooped over his head from the top floor of- the Dandrige house. And then silence returns. Charley lifts his head, peering about in the darkness just in time to see a shape, more a shadow than a man, step out of the darkness no more than ten feet away. It's Jerry Dandrige. He glides toward the Jeep, tossing Billy a woman's purse. \nJERRY Here, you forgot this. Billy one-hands it out of the air, turning back for the Jeep. Just then the back door to Charley's house bangs open, sending a shaft of light into the darkness. Judy Brewster stands there in the doorway, calling to her son. \nJUDY Charley! Dandrig.e and Billy Cole freeze, both of them turning to look at the back door to the Brewster house, inadvertently staring right at the clump of bushes where Charley.is hid .ing. Dandrige takes a step forward, his eyes probing the dark- ness as though he can actually see through the murky black- ness right to where Charley hides. Terrified, Charley suddenly leaps to his feet and races back into his own yard, disappearing through the back door with his mother. Billy steps forward as though to follow the boy. Jerry puts out a restraining hand, stopping him. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n23 INT. CHARLEY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT \nCharley sits at the kitchen table, his mother putting a cup of hot cocoa into his hand. \n(CONTINUED) \nyl Rev. 11/23/84 17. \n23 CONTINUED: \nJUDY Here, drink this.. \nCHARLEY-, \n(ALREADY FRUSTRATED \nAS HELL) Mom, I don't need hot cocoa. I didn't have a nightmare. They did kill a girl over there. \nJUDY (feeling his forehead for a fever) Charley, how late did you stay up studying? \nCHARLEY (shoving her hand away) iMom, I'm not sick. The guy did have `fangs and a bat did fly over my head .and then Jerry Dandrige stepped out of the shadows. You know what that means, don't you? \nJUDY (staring at him worriedly) What?. \nCHARLEY He's a vam_re! \nJUDY (.staring at him \nINCREDULOUSLY) A what? \nMATCH CUT TO: \n24 INT. AMY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY \nAmy's staring at him much as his mother did, with a look of shock and total disbelief on her face. \nAMY A what? \nCHARLEY (frustrated as hell \nAGAIN) A vampire, damnit! Haven't you listened to anything I've said? \n(CONTINUED) \nRev. 11/23/84 18. \n24 CONTINUED: \nAMY Charley, is this some kind of trick to get me 'back? \nCHARLEY (turning toward the door in disgust) i Forget it, L'm going to the police. \n", "test2_input": "(STEPPING IN) You remember a fruitcake kid named Charley Brewster. He said he came to see you? \nPETER' (shaking his head) No. \nAMY He's the one who thinks a vampire is living next door. \n(CONTINUED) \nyl Rev. 11/23/84 43. \n69 CONTINUED: (2) \n1 PETER \n(SMILING) Oh, yes. He's insane. (looking at Amy) Dear me, I hope he's not a friend of yours? \nEVIL ED . \n(MALICIOUSLY) She's got the hots for the creep. She flushes and smacks Evil Ed, making him yelp. She turns back to Peter. \nAMY We need your help' to stop him, Mr. Vincent. You see, he really does believe his next 'door neighbor is a vampire. Re's planning to kill him. \nEVIL ED \n(GLEEFULLY) Yeah, with a stake through the heart. 'Peter stares at them for a moment. \nPETER Are you two serious? (as Any nods) My dear, your friend needs a psychiatrist, not'a vampire killer. \nAMY \n(BEGGING) Please, Mr. Vincent. \nPETER I'm afraid not, my dear. (nodding at an open suitcase on the bed) You see, Hollywood beckons. I've been offered a starring role in a major movie. I've even had to quit Fright Night. So you see, I'm \nAFRAID -- \n.AMY I'll hire you. I'll give you money. \nPETER (quick as a wink) How much? \n(CONTINUED) \nor Rev. 11/26/84 44. \n69 CONTINUED: (3) \nAMY I have a five hundred dollar savings \nBOND -- \nPETER I'll take it. (sitting in a chair across from her, sud- denly all charm) Now how are we going to cure your little friend of this delusion? \nEVIL ED I got it all figured out. We all go next door to the neighbor and you run some kind of vampire test on-him and pronounce-him human. Like in \"Orgy of the Damned.\" You know, where you looked in the mirror and the guy didn't have a reflection and then you knew he was a vampire. \nPETER \n(GETTING MISTY-EYED) Ah, yes, that was one of my favorite roles. I still have the prop. 'He pulls out a silver cigarette case and flips it open. The inside of the lid is a mirror. He suddenly snaps it shut and slips it back into his pocket, looking up at them. \nPETER It sounds fine to me, but how do we get this next door neighbor to agree? \nEVIL ED \n(CONFIDENTLY) Leave that to me -- Nobody glances out the window as Evil Ed picks up the phone and dials 411, but if they did, they'd see night has fallen. \nCUT TO: \n70 INT. DANDRIGE HOUSE - PORTICO - STAIRWAY - NIGHT \nAs the CAMERA watches all the clocks on the wall begin to tick, signaling dusk has fallen and Jerry is awakening.

Jerry takes it. \nJERRY Yes. \n(HE LISTENS) Yes, this is Jerry Dandrige. (he listens some more, slowly smiling) I see. Yes, of course, I'm always willing to help young people. But Vm afraid crosses wouldn't do. You see, I've been reborn recently. He smiles at Billy; Billy smiles back. \nCUT BACK TO: \n71 INT. PETER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nEvil Ed cups his hand over the receiver and turns to Peter as Amy watches.' \nEVIL ED He's a reborn Christian. He thinks crosses would be sacrilegious. \nPETER Ask him how he feels-about holy water? \nEVIL ED (back.into the phone) How about holy water? (he listens, then back \nTO PETER) Won't do either. \nPETER Tell him it'll-be just ordinary tap water and all he has to do is take a sip. Evil Ed turns back to the phone. \nCUT BACK TO: \n71A INT. DANDRIGE HOUSE - PORTICO - NIGHT \nJerry listens into the phone while Billy watches. \nJERRY Yes, that sounds fine. Only don't come over till six tomorrow. \n(PAUSE) I'll be out until then. He slowly hangs up and turns to Billy. \nJERRY It seems we won't have to go out tonight after all. His friends are bringing him over tomorrow night. \n(PAUSE) To prove to him that I'm not a vampire. Billy smiles. So does Jerry. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n72 OMITTED \n73 EXT. BREWSTER AND DANDRIGE HOUSE - NIGHT \nEvil Ed and Amy drive up in a cab, hopping out, and hurry up the walk toward Charley's house. \n74 INT. CHARLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT \nCharley sits in the dark-, a razor sharp wooden stake in one hand, a hammer in the other. He's dividing his attention between the window and the door. There is a M40CK at the door. He raises the stake, ready to defend himself. \nCHARLEY Who is it? \nEVIL ED (O . S . ) It's me and Amy, stupid. Open up. Charley opens the-door and lets them in. Amy throws her- self into his arms, almost dancing around the room in her joy. \nAMY Charley, Peter Vincent said he'd come. \nCHARLEY He did. When? \nAMY Tomorrow at six. \n(CONTINUED) \n74 CONTINUED% \nCHARLEY \n(SUDDENLY FRIGHTENED) But Dandrige will be out of his coffin by then. \nEVIL ED, Relax, he's Peter Vincent, the Great Vampire Killer.

Maybe.he didn't take it \nSERIOUSLY -- \n", "test3_input": "They come up the staircase to find themselves enclosed in darkness. Peter pulls out a flashlight and flicks it on, shining it about the musty, filthy room. He pauses as rats scatter beneath the unexpected blaze. He continues to search with the flashlight, picking out the remains of a--ruined window at the far end, the glass shat- tered, the window itself flung wide open. \nCHARLEY Well, he was here -- The beam moves on, only to suddenly stop on a large chest shoved in a corner. \nPETER There, his-coffin. Both of them approach, staring down at the long chest. Peter hands the flashlight to Charley, pulling a stake from his pocket, a hammer from his belt. He raises the stake in the air, the hammer ready. He nods at the coffin. \nPETER Open i t. Charley throws his shoulder against the lid, heaving. The lid opens with a GROAN, Peter about to stab down only to find it empty. \nCHARLEY (almost in despair) God' damn him. Where is he? \n145A EXT.

ATTIC - NIGHT \nCharley and Peter stare up at the beams overhead as dust trickles down, the THUD of Jerry landing above them on the roof still loud in their ears. \nPETER Well, now we know where he is. \nCHARLEY Yeah, but what's he doing up there? \n146 EXT. DANDRIGE HOUSE - ROOF - NIGHT \nJerry sits on the roof, squatting there like some huge nocturnal bird of prey, his eyes closed, his lips moving in a whisper. \n147 INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nAmy lies on the floor, hardly moving now. Suddenly she groans and rolls over, throwing a hand over her face as though trying to ward off some particularly terrible night- mare. \n.148 EXT. ROOF - NIGHT \nDandrige's face darkens even more in concentration. \nJERRY Amy, awake, I command you to awake! \n149 INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nAmy's eyes slowly open. There's not a vestige of human life in them. She blinks and her eyes go completely red, glowing in the dark. Dandrige's voice fills her. mind like distant thunder. \nJERRY'S VOICE Now show me how much you love me, Amy, kill them both! She rises and moves like a zombie messenger of death toward the door to the hallway and the attic above. \n149A INT. ATTIC - NIGHT \nCharley and Peter are still staring up at the attic ceil- ing above, the waiting becoming unendurable for Charley. \nCHARLEY I'm going up there.

Charley is already out the window. \n149B EXT. ROOF - NIGHT \nCharley climbs onto the roof, a cross in his hand, a stake in the other. The roof looks deserted, but hidden behind the chimney stands Jerry, waiting for the boy. Unaware of the danger., Charley reaches the chimney and stealthily be- gins to circle it, sensing danger, the cross and stake in hand. He suddenly reaches the side where last we saw Jerry only to find no one there. He stands there puzzled, looking about. \nPETER (0.3 . ) (calling up from the attic below) Do you see him? \nCHARLEY \n", "test3_true": "150 INT.'ATTIC 'MIGHT \nPeter stands alone at the far end next to the coffin, ner- vously talking.to himself. \nPETER Where the hell is he? And in the window directly behind his back, Jerry rises up out of the dark, no more than a few feet away, only 'a thin pane of glass separating Peter from his clawed hand. He raises it to strike through the glass at Peter just as .Charley slides in the open window at the far end from the roof and sees Jerry in the window behind Peter.. He screams out. \nCHARLEY Peter, behind you! Peter whirls, holding up his cross and as quickly as he appeared from the night, Jerry slips back into it, leaving Peter staring at the window, terrified at the close call as Charley reaches his' side. \nCHARLEY You okay? \n(CONTINUED) \ngr Rev. 11/26/84 96. \n150 CONTINUED: Peter nods numbly as a huge shadow rises up along the staircase wall at the far end of the attic behind them, a shadow that suggests Jerry is coming up the stairs from the floor below toward them. A STAIR CREAKS behind them and Charley and Peter whirl to see Amy step out of the stairwell. She looks incred- ibly beautiful as though somehow her moment with Dandrige has transformed her from virginal girl to a full grown woman, dripping with sensuality. Charley steps forward, about to rush into her arms. \nCHARLEY \nAMY -- \nPETER \n(GRABBING HIM) No! Charley looks at Amy as she clears the steps and turns to- ward them. Peter shines his flashlight into her face. The eyes glow red, the face lifeless, fangs, larger now than before, protruding.from her upper lip. \nCHARLEY Oh, my God -- Suddenly they hear Dandrige cruelly laughing at them from the floor below, laughing like this is the best joke he's ever heard.. \nCHARLEY He's downstairs now -- Amy suddenly launches herself at Charley, seizing.him by the throat and throwing him to the floor, landing on top of him. He grabs her by the shoulders, holding her back as she tries to plunge her fangs into his neck. Peter steps up behind her, a stake raised in his hands, about to plunge it into her back. Charley screams up at him. \nCHARLEY No! Peter shifts his grip on the stake, holding it like a club, and brings it slamming down on her back. She collapses un- conscious on top of Charley. He shoves her off, climbing to his feet, and turning toward the staircase to the floor below. \nCHARLEY Come on -- \n(CONTINUED) \npk Rev. 11/16/84 97. \n15'0 CONTINUED: (2) The two men plunge down the stairs.

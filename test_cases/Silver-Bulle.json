The inside is a jungle of plants that have run to riot. In the f.g. is a mucky-looking garden patch where nothing much is growing. \nEXT.  MARTY AND TAMMY \nShe is quite deeply troubled. \nTAMMY I've been hearing noises in there. \nMARTY What kind of noises? \nTAMMY Rattling. Rustling. \nMARTY Rats... \nTAMMY And my dad says it's kids. But it's not rats and it's not kids. It's- \nEXT.  THE STURMFULLER HOUSE, WITH MILT \nOh my suds and body, here is the Great American Alcoholic for sure - the rural version. MILT is wearing a suit of pee-stained thermal underwear. He's wearing a baseball cap with the word \"Caterpillar\" on the front and has a bottle of beer in one hand (I'm pretty sure that his beer is Rheingold the dry beer). With his other hand he is busily scratching his crotch. \nMILT Tammy, you get on in here and do some dishes! \nEXT.  THE GREENHOUSE \nSinister...spooky. \nTAMMY (voice) I've got to go. \nEXT.  MARTY AND TAMMY \nMARTY I'd go out and take a look myself, but I think the Bullet'd get stuck in the garden. It looks sorta greasy. \nShe smiles at him, bends over, and kisses him on the mouth. MARTY is stunned... but happy. \nTAMMY You would, wouldn't you? \nMARTY (Joe Cool) Sure. No sweat. \nTAMMY Well, it's probably nothing. I'm just spooked since... you know. \nMARTY Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay? \nTAMMY Okay. Have you got enough gas to get home, Marty? \nMARTY (Startled) Jeez! \nEXT.  THE WHEELCHAIR \"DASHBOARD,\" MARTY'S POV \nThere's a gas gauge here, and the needle is almost on \"E.\" \nEXT.  MARTY AND TAMMY \nMARTY I'm always doing this! I gotta go, Tammy. \nMILT (voice) TAMMY! \nTAMMY (calls) Coming Daddy! (To MARTY) Bye... thanks again for coming home with me. \nShe waves and goes biking down the driveway as MARTY motors back onto the street and turns toward town. \nEXT.  TAMMY \nShe brings her bike to a stop by her father. \nMILT 'Bout time. Why you want to hang around that cripple? \nTAMMY I like him. \nMILT Goddamn cripples always end up on welfare. Ought to electrocute all of 'em. Balance the fucking budget. \nHaving delivered this pearl of wisdom, MILT goes inside, now scratching his ass. TAMMY pauses a moment and looks toward THE CAMERA, her face troubled and scared. \nEXT.  THE DESERTED GREENHOUSE, TAMMY'S VIEW \nDISSOLVES TO: \nEXT.  MARTY \nHe's buzzing along toward downtown, which is still some distance away - but at least he's made it back to the sidewalk again. \nMARTY (prayerfully) Come on, baby- \nHe looks down at: \nEXT.  THE WHEELCHAIR GAS GAUGE, MARTY'S POV \nNow the needle is lying all the way over on \"E.\" \nEXT.  VIRGIL'S TEXACO  LATE AFTERNOON \nMARTY pulls in. The wheelchair motor starts to pop and lug and misfire. The chair makes it to the first pump on the island closest to the street and then stalls as VIRGIL CUTTS comes over. \nVIRGIL Well, Marty! I see you lucked out again! \nMARTY Yep. Would you fill it up, please, Mr. Cutts? \nVIRGIL Want me to check the oil? \n", "test1_true": "VIRGIL Wipe the windshield an check the driver's bullshit level? \nMARTY laughs; VIRGIL starts carefully pumping gas into the Silver Bullet's small tank. \nEXT.  THE COSLAW HOUSE  NIGHT \nOverhead is the moon, three days past the full. \nUNCLE AL (voice) I'll see your Carlton Fiske and raise you a George Brett... a Dave Kingman... and a Rod Carew. \nINT.  THE KITCHEN DOORWAY, WITH NAN COSLAW  NIGHT \nShe's wiping her hands with a dishtowel and looks like she just bit into a lemon. \nINT.  THE DEN, WITH UNCLE AL AND MARTY  NIGHT \nUNCLE AL is the family's sheep of a darker color. He's thirty, good-looking, raffish. He's also drunk. He's got both whiskey and beer. An ashtray beside him overflows with butts. \nHe and MARTY are playing draw poker for MARTY'S baseball cards. Each has a pile in front of him. \nMARTY really loves UNCLE AL... his eyes just glow when he looks at him. \nMARTY Okay, okay. I call. \nHe tosses in three baseball cards. \nUNCLE AL Wait a minute, wait a minute! \nHe grabs one of MARTY'S cards, looks at it, and tosses it back. \nUNCLE AL Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager! Stone the crows! \nMARTY Okay, okay. Dwight Evans. \nUNCLE AL Piss on him. Piss on all the Red Sox. \nHe swallows whiskey and chases it with beer. \nINT.  THE DEN, A WIDER ANGLE \nNAN comes briskly over. She's seen and heard enough. She favors UNCLE AL with a glare and then looks protectively at MARTY. \nNAN Come on, Marty- bedtime. \nShe starts to wheel him away. \nMARTY Mom-! \nUNCLE AL Let the boy finish the game, Nan. \nHe means it, drunk or not. She reluctantly rolls MARTY back to the table. \nNAN Make it quick. \nUNCLE AL lays down his hand. \nUNCLE AL Three kings. \nMARTY (delighted) I got a straight to the queen! \nUNCLE AL Bullshit luck! \nNAN (outraged) That's enough! \nMARTY (as his mother wheels him away) Aww, Mom-! \nINT.  THE STAIRWELL OF THE COSLAW HOME \nMARTY is sitting in a stair chair that rises slowly to the second floor. He looks dejected and glum. \nSOUND of NAN hectoring her brother AL. I don't think we can make out all of what's going on, but we've all known women like NAN and I think we can fill in the blanks. \"Christian household... you come here drunk and expect... can't even bother to call ahead...\" Etc., etc. \nA wheelchair stands on the second-floor landing. This one is no Silver Bullet, only the more humble sort that moves by arm power. When the stair chair clicks to a stop, MARTY hoists himself from it into the wheelchair and rolls down the hall toward the bathroom. \nBelow, NAN'S rant is still going on. \nINT.  THE DEN, WITH NAN AND UNCLE AL  NIGHT \nUNCLE AL is clearing up in a kind of drunken stupor- and I mean he is really drunk. He's smoking one cigarette; another is smoldering away in the heaping ashtray. He drops a pile of baseball cards on the floor and bonks his head on the table bending down to pick them up. \nNAN I don't want you drinking around Marty. That's too much. If you can't stop it, you better stay away. \nAL straightens up. There is a sort of command force in this man, and here he is partly able to rise above his abysmal drunkenness so we can see it. \nUNCLE AL I come here because Marty needs a friend. \nNAN Yes... you've always been that to him. But if you can't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just stay away. \nShe leaves the room, almost crying. UNCLE AL looks after her, and then his attention is drawn to the smoldering ashtray. He pours beer over the mess, putting out the fire but creating something that looks even worse. He begins drunkenly picking up again. \nUNCLE AL (to himself) Another wonderful time at Sister Nan's house! Heeyyy! \nINT.  THE UPSTAIRS COSLAW BATHROOM \nMARTY, now in pj's, is brushing his teeth. \n", "test1_id": 3057, "test2_input": "INT.  BILLY McCLAREN, AT THE BAR \nHe's looking toward the table where the Fairton group sits. \nBILLY (mildly) Last town report said you was in arrears your taxes, Andy. Guess you must have paid up, huh? \nINT.  THE FAIRTON TABLE \nANDY What are you, trying to be smart? \nOWEN KNOPFLER comes over. \nOWEN You guys turn down the thermostat or I'm gonna turn you all out. Now who's drinking? \nANDY (sulks) Bring me a Schlitz. \nEXT.  A TREE, WITH BRADY'S SMILE-KITE STUCK IN IT  DUSK \nSOUND of panting. \nMARTY comes into the frame, pulling himself up by the arms. His arms are very strong, although his legs trail limply behind him (like the tail of a kite). He sits on a branch, untangles the kite and the string, and looks down. \nMARTY (calls) Here it comes! \nEXT.  THE FOOT OF THE TREE, WITH BRADY \nBRADY Drop it! \nAs the kite flutters down, JANE comes biking up. \nJANE Marty Coslaw, you get down out of that tree! \nEXT.  MARTY, IN THE TREE \nHe descends, then hangs from the lowest branch. \nMARTY Push the Bullet over, Jane, okay? \nEXT.  MARTY AND JANE \nJANE (makes no immediate move to do so) Supper was an hour ago, Dumbo. \nMARTY (hanging) Oh, Jeez! I forgot! Is she mad? \nJANE They both are. At me, for not getting you sooner. I ought to let you fall. \nBut she pushes the chair over and MARTY drops into it. He pushes the starter and the Silver Bullet fires up. \nEXT.  BRADY, FLYING HIS KITE ON THE COMMON  DUSK \nMARTY (voice) Hey, Brady! You coming? \nBRADY (looking into the sky) In a while! \nBRADY could give a shit if MARTY'S in trouble. He just waves vaguely. He's into the kite-flying experience, as the folks in Marin County might say. \nEXT.  MARTY AND JANE \nHe's looking toward the common, frowning and uncertain. \nJANE Come on, Marty. \nShe starts biking away. MARTY starts after her, pauses, and looks at: \nEXT.  BRADY, ON THE COMMON  DUSK \nCAMERA PANS SLOWLY UP to the yellow smile-kite in the bluish-purple sky. \nINT.  OWEN'S PUB  LATE DUSK \nThe former patrons are still here, with the exceptions of LOWE, BILLY McCLAREN, and BOBBY ROBERTSON. Many others have appeared; this is Happy Hour. Among them we see MR. ASPINALL, the principal, and PELTZER, the druggist. A barmaid, NORMA, circulates with drinks and beers. \nSpeaking of beer, ANDY FAIRTON has gotten through a fair amount of Schlitz. It hasn't mellowed him, however; he's more belligerent than ever. \nANDY (holding forth) This whole investigation has been as efficient as a Polish fire drill! It- \nPETE (bravely) I've heard enough out of you, Andy. If you don't shut your mouth, I'm going to shut it for you. \nINT.  THE DOOR OF OWEN'S PLACE \nIt opens and a man in a business suit- HERB KINCAID- comes in. He is carrying a briefcase and he looks worried. \nINT.  THE GROUP AT THE FAIRTON TABLE \nANDY (astounded) What did you say? \nINT.  THE BAR, WITH OWEN KNOPFLER \nOWEN Jesus wept. \nHe reaches under the bar and comes out with a baseball bat. Burned into the side of the bat, so it reads vertically toward the handle, is the word \"peacemaker.\" OWEN hurries around the bar with it. \nINT.  THE FAIRTON GROUP \nPETE is standing in front of ANDY, fists balled up, fat face trembling with determination. \nPETE You heard what I said, motormouth. \n", "test2_true": "INT.  HERB KINCAID \nHe clears his throat. This is a mild, timid man- he doesn't like to speak in public, particularly not in a bar, but the imperatives of the situation demand it right now. \nHERB (quite loudly) Has anyone in here seen my son Brady? \nINT.  THE PUB, A NEW ANGLE \nEveryone looks at HERB. Conversation stops. ANDY and PETE freeze with their fists balled up, like little kids playing statues tag. OWEN is caught a little distance from ANDY and PETE, with the \"peacemaker\" still in his hands. \nEXT.  THE TOWN COMMON, LONG \nNow it is almost completely dark, and a large reddish summer moon is rising over the horizon. \nSOUND: A LONG, WAVERING WOLF HOWL... LOUD. \nINT.  OWEN'S PUB \nAll conversation has stopped. All have turned toward the door and the windows; all hear the HOWL. Deep fright overlies each face. \nNORMA drops her tray. Glasses and bottles shatter. \nINT.  THE MAIN CORRIDOR OF THE TOWN HALL \nJOE HALLER comes out of the constable's office in a hurry, letting the door bang the wall. He's buckling on his gun belt. \nEXT.  THE BANDSTAND \nBRADY'S kite, torn in a couple of places, flutters on the steps leading up to the bandstand. The yellow smile face grins eerily in the darkness. It is streaked with blood. \nINT.  OWEN'S PUB \nHERB Brady! \nHe breaks for the door. ANDY FAIRTON grabs him. \nHERB Get out of my way! \nHe pushes ANDY aside. HERB is out the door, chased by PETE and several of the others. \nEXT.  THE BANDSTAND  NIGHT \nJOE HALLER (low voice) Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women... \nHe comes out of the shadows, his drawn gun dangling by his side. This man has had an extremely bad shock. The legs of his uniform pants are splashed with blood. He makes it down two steps and then sits heavily by the remains of BRADY'S smiling, bloody kite. He looks straight ahead. He looks at nothing. \nHALLER (low) ...and blessed is the fruit of Thy womb. Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now...now... \nHe looks at the kite, then looks away. He puts a hand over his face and starts to cry. \nEXT.  THE COMMON, LOOKING BACK TOWARD MAIN STREET  NIGHT \nA number of men - not all that were in Owen's but quite a few of them - are running toward the bandstand. HERB KINCAID is in the lead, screaming his son's name over and over. \nSOUND: A LONG HOWL, now at some distance. \nEXT.  THE BANDSTAND, WITH HALLER AND KINCAID \nAs HERB KINCAID approaches. \nHALLER Stay off the bandstand, Herb. \nHERB Is it my boy? Is it Brady? \nHALLER Don't go up- \nHERB (lunges past him) Brady! Brady! \nDisappears into the dark. HALLER looks down at his lap. \nHERB Br-(CUTS OFF) \nThe other men arrive, PETE in the lead. HALLER doesn't look up. \nPETE Joe, is it- \nHALLER (not looking up) Shhh. \nPETE Is it the Kicaid b- \nHALLER (not looking up) Shhh, I said. \nThe men look uneasily at HALLER, at each other. ANDY FAIRTON shoves forward. \nANDY What the fuck is going on h- \nSOUND: HERB SCREAMS. A pause. HERB screams again. The men flinch back. HALLER doesn't look up. Now, from the darkness on the bandstand, HERB begins to LAUGH. The men shrink back further, looking more uneasy than ever. \nHERB (voice; laughing) We'll bury his shoes. \nNow HALLER gets up and joins the other men. \nHERB (voice; laughing) That's what we'll have to do; we'll bury his shoes. Maybe in a couple of Roi-Tan cigar boxes. \nEXT.  THE BANDSTAND, MEN'S POV  NIGHT \n", "test2_id": 3058, "test3_input": "It's not working. Many of the men look disgusted with both ANDY and themselves. \nANDY (louder) He ain't got so much as a fingerprint! \nOWEN KNOPFLER Ah, shut up, Andy. \nANDY Don't tell me to- \nHERB KINCAID steps forward. \nHERB Yes. Correct. Shut up. \nANDY, surprised and bewildered, does. HERB turns and looks grimly at JOE HALLER, who can barely meet his gaze. \nHERB (quietly) I just came from my boy's funeral. \nHALLER Herb...I know how upset- how grief-stricken you must be...but- \nHERB (quietly) He was torn apart. \nUtter silence in OWEN'S place now. The others are staring, rapt. \nHALLER Yes. Yes, but- \nHERB (still quiet) Upset, you say. Grief-stricken, you say. Constable, you don't know what those words mean. My son was torn to pieces. To pieces! \nHERB turns to the others in the pub. Tears stream down his face. \nHERB My son was torn to pieces! (turning back to HALLER) You come in here and talk to these men about private justice. You dare to do that. Constable Haller, why don't you go out to Harmony Hill and dig up what's left of Brady and explain to him about private justice. Would you want to do that? \nHALLER makes no reply. He looks down at his feet. \nHERB No. I thought not. (to the others) You folks stay here if you want. I wouldn't ask anyone to do anything that runs counter to his conscience. As for me... I'm going out and hunt up a little private justice. \nANDY FAIRTON has swelled up again. He grins poisonously at the slumped HALLER. He pushes off after HERB KINCAID. Other men start to follow. \nEXT.  OWEN'S PUB \nMen are streaming out, getting into station wagons and pickup trucks. Engines roar into life. They begin backing out even as more men come out of the pub. We even hear some high-spirited yells; they are on their way and their blood is up. \nINT.  OWEN'S PUB \nLESTER LOWE, looking more distressed than ever, pushes his way through the men toward the door, and THE CAMERA FOLLOWS. He grabs BILLY McCLAREN. \nLOWE Billy... Billy, this is a bad idea. Joe can... \nBILLY (not looking at LOWE) Joe's had his chance, Father. Leave me be. \nHe pushes outside. LOWE looks around wildly; his face says he can't believe this is happening. He grabs PORTER ZINNEMAN, then, as PORTER shoves by him, at a couple of others with mounting desperation. \nHALLER makes his way to LOWE through the thinning crowd and draws him aside. \nHALLER Let them go. \nLOWE But- \nHALLER This is that spirit of community you were talking about. Grand, ain't it? Maybe they'll shoot a hitchhiker or something and Andy can mount the head and raffle it off. To benefit the Medcu van, of course. \nHALLER laughs. \nLOWE But can't we do anything? \nOWEN KNOPFLER hurries past them; he has a rifle over one shoulder in a sling. In his left hand he carries the peacemaker bat. \nHALLER Sure. We can pray to Christ that none of them get killed. \nEXT.  OUTSIDE OWEN'S \nMore cars and trucks pull away. There's a big old Ford \"woody\" wagon still there, with ANDY FAIRTON standing impatiently by the driver's side door. BILLY McCLAREN and BOBBY ROBERTSON are with him, and a big, solid-looking woman named MAGGIE ANDREWS. \nOWEN comes out and crosses to the woody. \nANDY Well, it's about frigging time! They'll have his hide tacked to somebody's barn door before we get out there! \nThey pile into the car, ANDY behind the wheel. He throws it into gear and backs out onto Main Street. \nEXT.  MAIN STREET, A NEW ANGLE \nWe see a parade of cars and pickup trucks headed out of town. \nEXT.  FATHER LESTER LOWE \nHe's standing on the curb and watching them leave town in procession, some honking their horns, others yelling cheerfully. The expression on his face is dark and brooding. \nEXT.  THE FULL MOON, CU  NIGHT \nEXT.  ELMER AND PORTER ZINNEMAN  NIGHT \nELMER is lying on his belly, stuck halfway under a barbed-wire fence. The seat of his pants is badly snagged. The brothers are on the verge of a wooded area. We can see ground mist creeping around the bottoms of the trees. \nELMER Help me Porter, goddammit! \nPORTER grabs ELMER'S right arm and pulls. There's a RIPPING SOUND. ELMER screams. \nELMER Don't pull me! You want to rip the right cheek of my ass right off? \nPORTER Well, Elmer, there are folks that'd say you've been half-assed most of your- \n", "test3_true": "PORTER begins to pick the barbed wire out of ELMER'S pants. \nEXT.  IN THE WOODS, WITH REV. O'BANION AND VIRGIL CUTTS NIGHT \nO'BANION looks rather amusing in his hunting gear- like that priest from \"The Exorcist\" on safari. \nSOUND: A HOWL, FAIRLY LOUD \nVIRGIL Jesus, that was close. Uh, pardon me, Rev'runt. \nO'BANION Come on. Be careful. \nThey move slowly ahead, O'BANION still a bit in the lead. THE CAMERA FOLLOWS as the reverend pushes into some knee-high brush. \nSOUND: A RUSTY METALLIC CLANG, followed by a FLESHY CHOMP. \nO'BANION begins to scream and struggle. \nVIRGIL Rev'runt! What is it? \nO'BANION (screaming) My foot! My foot! \nVIRGIL lunges to him and looks down. \nEXT.  O'BANION'S FOOT, VIRGIL'S POV \nA medium-sized trap- something in which one might reasonably catch a wild cat or a coydog, let us say- has its rusty teeth sunk deeply into the reverend's ankle. \nEXT.  O'BANION AND VIRGIL \nO'BANION (SCREAMING) Get it off me! Get it off me! \nVIRGIL (flustered) Sure...okay... \nHe kneels down. \nEXT.  VIRGIL \nHe muscles the trap open, a little at a time. \nEXT.  O'BANION \nRelaxing. \nSOUND: THE WOLF HOWLING CLOSE. \nEXT.  VIRGIL \nStartled and unnerved by the HOWL, the trap slips out of his hands and snaps shut on O'BANION'S mangled ankle again. \nEXT.  REVEREND O'BANION \nHe screams. \nEXT.  THE MOON, CU \nIt slides behind a cloud. \nSOUND: THE WOLF HOWLING. \nEXT.  ANDY FAIRTON'S GROUP \nANDY, BILLY McCLAREN, BOBBY ROBERTSON, OWEN KNOPFLER, and MAGGIE ANDREWS have been joined by two other men- MR. ASPINALL and EDGAR ROUNDS. \nThey have drawn close together, listening as the HOWL FADES. We can tell by their uneasy faces that some of the joy has gone out of the evening. \nThey are standing on one side of a ravine. The bottom is filled with a still ground mist. A few bushes poke out of it. There are woods on the far side. \nANDY (pointing across) It came from over there. \nBOBBY ROBERTSON As far as I could tell, it could have come from anywhere. \nANDY We'll spread out in a skirmish line. If the bastard tries to go around us, we'll hear him. \nBOBBY I dunno- \nMAGGIE I think Bobby Robertson here's making lemonade in his pants. That lemonade got ice cubes in it, Bobby? \nANDY FAIRTON and EDGAR ROUNDS laugh. ASPINALL and BILLY McCLAREN smile a little. \nOWEN (quietly) Let off him, Maggie. I'm scared, too. \nBOBBY (stoutly) I ain't scared! Let's go! \nANDY Okay. Spread out on me. Five feet apart. \nEXT.  ANDY'S GROUP, FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE RAVINE \nReading from right to left: OWEN KNOPFLER (his gun is still over his shoulder; it is the peacemaker baseball bat he is holding), BOBBY ROBERTSON, ASPINALL, ANDY FAIRTON, BILLY McCLAREN, EDGAR ROUNDS and MAGGIE ANDREWS. \nThey come slowly down toward THE CAMERA, alert and ready for anything- at least, they think so. \nEXT.  ANDY'S GROUP, ANGLE SHOT \nThey reach the bottom of the ravine and begin to make their way across it. The mist is waist to chest deep. They push toward the other side. Now they are about halfway. \n", "test3_id": 3059}

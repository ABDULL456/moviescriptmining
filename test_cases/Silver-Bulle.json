{"train": "SILVER BULLET by Stephen King Based on his story \"Cycle of the Werewolf\" \nFADE IN: \nEXT.  THE FULL MOON, CLOSE  NIGHT \nIt nearly fills the screen, swimming mysteriously in the warm late summer air. \nSOUND: Crickets. \nTHE CAMERA PANS SLOWLY DOWN TO: \nEXT.  TRAIN TRACKS IN THE COUNTRY  NIGHT - AND MOONLIGHT \nCREDITS BEGIN. \nA rail-rider comes chugging along the tracks. Aboard is ARNIE WESTRUM, a big man in a strappy T-shirt and chino pants. He is drinking beer. \nARNIE (sings) My beer is Rheingold the dry beer... Think of Rheingold whenever you buy beer... \nHe drains the rest of his own bottle of Rheingold and tosses it to one side. Up ahead we see a switching point. \nARNIE throws the rail-rider into neutral, opens the toolbox on the back, and brings out a big five-cell flashlight. He shines it on the switch. \nHe gets a crowbar from the toolbox, plus a big wrench, a pair of pliers, a hammer, and a pair of work gloves. He also gets another bottle of beer and sticks it into his back pocket. \nARNIE jumps down and approaches the switch. \nCREDITS CONTINUE. \nEXT. ARNIE, AT THE SWITCHING POINT  NIGHT \nHe drops his tools, pulls on his work gloves, and trains the light on the switch for a moment. During this: \nARNIE (sings) It's not bitter, not sweet, it's a real frosty treat, won't you try, won't you buy Rheingold beer... \nHe tries the switch. No go. It's frozen. \nARNIE Stuck tighter'n dogshit in a deep freeze! \nHe takes the bottle of beer from his back pocket and fishes a churchkey from one of the front ones. He pops the cap and drinks deeply. He burps. Then he screws the half-empty bottle of beer into the cinders so it won't fall over. Then he picks up his crowbar. \nCREDITS CONTINUE. \nEXT.  THE RAIL-RIDER  NIGHT \nThere's a SOUND of bushes shaking. Something comes out - something huge. It leaps limberly onto the rail-rider. It is a werewolf with greenish-yellow eyes. Tatters of clothes still hang from it. \nWhat kind of monster, exactly? It is humanoid as well as wolfish... and when we learn who it is in its human form, we should be able to spot the resemblance at once...and kick ourselves for not knowing earlier. \nIt crouches there, huge and bushy and fanged and deadly, on the whole rail-rider. \nCREDITS CONCLUDE. \nEXT.  ARNIE  NIGHT \nHe's working the crowbar into the junction point just as hard as he can. Swearing at it under his breath. Suddenly, both the tracks and the switch move. \nARNIE Hot damn! Now... a little oil... \nHe turns back toward the rail-rider. \nEXT.  ARNIE, ARRIVING AT THE RAIL-RIDER  NIGHT \nARNIE It's not bitter, not sweet... it's a big fuckin' treat... \nA NOISE - bushes rattling; cinders clinking and rattling. ARNIE looks around. \nEXT.  THE RAILS AND THE SWITCHING POINT, ARNIE'S POV  NIGHT \nNothing there. His bottle of beer stands by the litter of his tools. \nEXT.  ARNIE, AT THE RAIL-RIDER  NIGHT \nHe's rooting around in the toolbox, back to the switching point. \nEXT.  ARNIE'S BOTTLE OF BEER, CU  NIGHT \nA hairy hand/paw closes around it - we see huge curved claws on that hand. \nEXT.  THE WEREWOLF'S FACE, CU  NIGHT \nGlaring green-yellow eyes; a savage, beastial face which is still half human. That's all we see. The rest is in shadow. It opens its mouth and upends the bottle of beer. Foamy Rheingold begins gurgling down the werewolf's throat. \nEXT.  ARNIE AT THE RAIL-RIDER  NIGHT \nHe comes up with an old-fashioned oilcan, the kind with the long spout. He starts back to the switching point, waving the can. \nARNIE (sings) My beer is Rheingold the dry beer... Think of Rheingold whenever you fry beer... \nHe arrives, looks down... and stops singing. His eyes widen. \nEXT.  THE CINDERS BY THE TRACK, ARNIE'S POV  NIGHT \nWe can see the hole where ARNIE put his beer, but it is of course empty. Beside it are two huge prints in the cinders, half wolf, half human. \nEXT.  ARNIE  NIGHT \nEXT.  ON THE BANDSTAND \nSTELLA has retreated to one of the benches, where she is bawling into a handful of Kleenex. Pudgy and twenty-two, she is both funny and terribly sad. She looks around at the sound of JANE's voice. \nSTELLA (alarmed) Who - ? \nJANE (approaching closer) It's Jane, Stella. Jane Coslaw. \nSTELLA sees it is, and turns away from her, still weeping. JANE stands, uncertain what to do next. After a moment she approaches closer and touches STELLA'S turned back timidly. \nJANE (tenderly) What's wrong? \nSTELLA (weeping) He's going away. I know he is. \nJANE Who's going away? \nSTELLA turns to her, weeping still and distracted. \nSTELLA What am I going to tell my mother? If he won't marry me, what am I going to tell my mother? \nJANE (bewildered) Stella, I don't know what- \nSTELLA Oh, leave me alone! Just leave me alone, you stupid thing! \nSTELLA lumbers across the bandstand and down the steps. JANE stares after her, bewildered and perhaps even a little frightened. \nINT.  THE PODIUM, WITH REV. O'BANION \nO'BANION Let us pray. \nINT.  THE TOWN HALL GATHERING \nMost of them bow their heads. \nINT.  REV. O'BANION, AT THE PODIUM \nO'BANION May the Grace of God shine upon those gathered here... and lift them up... and grant success to the endeavor to which they have so openheartedly declared their support. Amen. \nINT.  THE GATHERING \nThey raise their heads. Some echo the \"Amen.\" Others cross themselves. \nEXT.  THE PICNIC AREA \nPeople are coming out and getting ready to chow-down. \nEXT.  THE COSLAW STATION WAGON  DAY \nTraveling along a country road. Headed home. \nINT.  THE STATION WAGON  DAY \nBOB and NAN COSLAW are sitting up front. MARTY and JANE are in the backseat. JANE is as far from MARTY as she can get. She's still mad as hell. Band-Aids crisscross her knees. \nMARTY'S wheelchair is collapsed in the cargo area of the wagon. \nNAN turns around to look at the kids - and it's really JANE she's mad at. \nNAN I want you two to bury the hatchet. You're being very silly, Jane. \nJANE (hot) Did you see my knees? \nMARTY Jane, I- \nNAN I think you're being mean as well as silly. Your brother has never had a scraped knee in his whole life. \nWell, here it is - the chief source of JANE'S animus against her brother and the source of most of the tension in the COSLAW family. \nMARTY winces and turns away a little, embarrassed - this always happens. He doesn't like it, but he doesn't know how to make his parents - his mother in particular - quit it. \nJANE You always take his side because he's a cripple! Well, it's not my fault that he's a cripple! \nMARTY Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him. \nJANE Brady's a booger and so are you! \nNAN Jane Coslaw! \nBOB (roars) Stop it or I'll throw the whole bunch of you out! \nIn this traditional family unit, BOB is the Voice of Authority. They all heed, although the atmosphere remains thundery. \nINT.  THE STATION WAGON  DAY \nTrain tracks run near the road. \nINT.  THE STATION WAGON, ENSEMBLE  DAY \nBOB (points) That's where poor old Arnie Westrum pitched his last drunk. \nHe crosses himself and they all look toward: \nEXT.  THE GS&WM RAILROAD TRACKS (STATION WAGON'S POV) \nINT.  THE CAR  DAY \nBOB They had to pick up what was left of him in a peach basket. \nSTELLA'S MOTHER, asleep in front of the TV. \nINT.  A PRETTY CHINA DISH, CU \nA whole bunch of capsules are dumped into it. \nTHE CAMERA DRAWS BACK to show us STELLA, sitting by her vanity mirror. The rest of the room is reflected in the mirror, including the window - we are upstairs. \n[NOTE: It would be nice to see that fat moon floating in the window!] \nThere's a framed picture of STELLA's ex-boyfriend on the vanity beside the dish of pills. STELLA sets down the empty prescription bottle the pills came from beside this picture. We can clearly read the word \"Nembutol\" on it. There is also a large glass of water on the vanity table. \nSTELLA turns the picture facedown. She might be crying but probably she's not. She takes about five of the pills, starts to lift them to her mouth- \nA HOWL outside... closer. \nSTELLA looks around for a moment, then takes the pills with some water. She pauses, looking at herself. \nSTELLA Suicides go to hell. Especially if they're pregnant. And I don't even care. \nShe takes another five pills. And another five. \nSOUNDS: Rattling foliage. \nEXT.  THE IVY TRELLIS  NIGHT \nClaw-hands are seizing it and climbing. SOUNDS of hoarse, guttural breathing. \nINT.  STELLA AT THE VANITY TABLE \nShe takes another handful of pills... and the window behind her shatters inward. There is a bellowing roar as the werewolf throws itself through. \nINT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH MOTHER \nShe sits up, startled awake. \nFrom upstairs: ANOTHER SHATTERING ROAR... FOLLOWED BY A SCREAM. \nINT.  STELLA'S ROOM, WITH STELLA \nShe runs... and a huge claw-hand rips through the back of her nightgown. \nINT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH MOTHER \nMOTHER Oh my dear God... Stella! \nShe runs for the doorway and the hall. From upstairs comes a confusion of SOUNDS: roars, breaking furniture, shattering glass. \nINT.  STELLA'S BED, CU \nOne of those deadly claw-hands sweeps down the bed, ripping through the sheets... the mattress... the spring itself. \nHairy, muddy feet with protruding talons leap onto it. \nEXT.  STELLA'S WINDOW, EXTREME UP-ANGLE \nThe werewolf leaps out - it's graceful, savage, animal. \nSOUND: A TRIUMPHANT HOWL. \nINT.  THE UPSTAIRS HALL, WITH MOTHER \nShe's found an ancient pistol somewhere and is lugging it gamely along. \nMOTHER Stella!...Stella! \nShe reaches the closed door of STELLA's room, vacillates there for a moment... and then pushes it open and goes in. \nA long beat of silence as we hold on the door. \nMOTHER SHRIEKS. \nINT.  MOTHER'S FACE, ECU \nShe shrieks again. \nINT.  STELLA'S ROOM, WIDE \nIt's a total shambles; blood is splattered everywhere; the mirror is broken, the picture of DAN the gay deceiver is broken; the bed is torn in two. There are big, muddy wolfprints on the remnants of the bed. \nSTELLA lies propped in the corner with Nembutols all around her. Suicide may have been what she planned, but it sure isn't what happened. \nMOTHER SHRIEKS. \nEXT.  TARKER'S MILLS MONTAGE  MORNING \na.) MR. PELTZER puts out his paper rack - just the \"Press-Herald\" this morning. He looks shocked and grim. The scare headline: BRUTAL MURDER ROCKS WESTERN MAINE. We can see STELLA'S photograph. b.) Through the window of Robertson's Luncheonette, we see the proprietor, BOBBY ROBERTSON, talking earnestly with a bunch of men. Among them: MILT STURMFULLER, ALFIE KNOPFLER, VIRGIL CUTTS, BILLY McCLAREN, and ELMER ZINNEMAN, a farmer we'll meet later. c.) At Andy's Sporting Goods, ANDY FAIRTON is putting a big hand-lettered sign in the window. It reads: REMINGTON SHOTGUNS SINGLE ACTION DOUBLE ACTION PUMP PROTECT YOURSELF AND YOUR FAMILY! d.) At the Methodist parsonage, a '53 Dodge pulls slowly out and MOTHER RANDOLPH gets out, weeping. As she approaches the parsonage door, LESTER LOWE comes out and embraces her. \nEXT.  A SMALL BRICK BUILDING ON MAIN STREET \nThe sign reads: TARKER'S MILLS TOWN OFFICE. \nINT.  A HALLWAY, FEATURING A DOOR WITH A PEBBLED-GLASS PANEL \nNeatly lettered on the panel: TARKER'S MILLS CONSTABULARY. And below this: JOSEPH HALLER. \nJOE HALLER (voice) Okay...yes...Oh, fuck off! \nIt stands a bit behind the house itself. A creepy place. Many of the glass panes are broken; some of these - not many - have been blocked with cardboard. The inside is a jungle of plants that have run to riot. In the f.g. is a mucky-looking garden patch where nothing much is growing. \nEXT.  MARTY AND TAMMY \nShe is quite deeply troubled. \nTAMMY I've been hearing noises in there. \nMARTY What kind of noises? \nTAMMY Rattling. Rustling. \nMARTY Rats... \nTAMMY And my dad says it's kids. But it's not rats and it's not kids. It's- \nEXT.  THE STURMFULLER HOUSE, WITH MILT \nOh my suds and body, here is the Great American Alcoholic for sure - the rural version. MILT is wearing a suit of pee-stained thermal underwear. He's wearing a baseball cap with the word \"Caterpillar\" on the front and has a bottle of beer in one hand (I'm pretty sure that his beer is Rheingold the dry beer). With his other hand he is busily scratching his crotch. \nMILT Tammy, you get on in here and do some dishes! \nEXT.  THE GREENHOUSE \nSinister...spooky. \nTAMMY (voice) I've got to go. \nEXT.  MARTY AND TAMMY \nMARTY I'd go out and take a look myself, but I think the Bullet'd get stuck in the garden. It looks sorta greasy. \nShe smiles at him, bends over, and kisses him on the mouth. MARTY is stunned... but happy. \nTAMMY You would, wouldn't you? \nMARTY (Joe Cool) Sure. No sweat. \nTAMMY Well, it's probably nothing. I'm just spooked since... you know. \nMARTY Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay? \nTAMMY Okay. Have you got enough gas to get home, Marty? \nMARTY (Startled) Jeez! \nEXT.  THE WHEELCHAIR \"DASHBOARD,\" MARTY'S POV \nThere's a gas gauge here, and the needle is almost on \"E.\" \nEXT.  MARTY AND TAMMY \nMARTY I'm always doing this! I gotta go, Tammy. \nMILT (voice) TAMMY! \nTAMMY (calls) Coming Daddy! (To MARTY) Bye... thanks again for coming home with me. \nShe waves and goes biking down the driveway as MARTY motors back onto the street and turns toward town. \nEXT.  TAMMY \nShe brings her bike to a stop by her father. \nMILT 'Bout time. Why you want to hang around that cripple? \nTAMMY I like him. \nMILT Goddamn cripples always end up on welfare. Ought to electrocute all of 'em. Balance the fucking budget. \nHaving delivered this pearl of wisdom, MILT goes inside, now scratching his ass. TAMMY pauses a moment and looks toward THE CAMERA, her face troubled and scared. \nEXT.  THE DESERTED GREENHOUSE, TAMMY'S VIEW \nDISSOLVES TO: \nEXT.  MARTY \nHe's buzzing along toward downtown, which is still some distance away - but at least he's made it back to the sidewalk again. \nMARTY (prayerfully) Come on, baby- \nHe looks down at: \nEXT.  THE WHEELCHAIR GAS GAUGE, MARTY'S POV \nNow the needle is lying all the way over on \"E.\" \nEXT.  VIRGIL'S TEXACO  LATE AFTERNOON \nMARTY pulls in. The wheelchair motor starts to pop and lug and misfire. The chair makes it to the first pump on the island closest to the street and then stalls as VIRGIL CUTTS comes over. \nVIRGIL Well, Marty! I see you lucked out again! \nMARTY Yep. Would you fill it up, please, Mr. Cutts? \nVIRGIL Want me to check the oil? \nJANE comes in- she's wearing a nightie. \nMARTY Mom was really mad at him this time, wasn't she? \nJANE What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed? \nMARTY Stop it! \nHe lunges at her, but JANE steps back easily. MARTY overbalances and falls out of the wheelchair. His toothbrush clatters across the tile. \nBOB COSLAW (sleepy voice) Hey! That you, Marty? \nJANE He's okay, Dad! \nShe looks around swiftly, then bends down. \nINT.  MARTY AND JANE, A MUCH CLOSER SHOT \nOne of MARTY'S cheeks is pressed against the floor. His eyes are shut. He's weeping. \nJANE (low) Marty, are you all right? \nMARTY Yes. Go away. \nJANE Let me help you up. \nNAN (voice) Marty? \nSOUND of her climbing the stairs. \nJANE throws a quick look back over her shoulder and then helps MARTY up in his chair. He helps by pulling on the sink counter. JANE has time to give MARTY one quick look- \"Please don't tell on me,\" it says. \nNAN comes in. \nNAN Jane, have you been teasing your brother again? \nMARTY She wasn't, Mom- I dropped my toothbrush and fell over when I tried to get it. Jane helped pick me up. \nHe bats his eyes at her. \nMARTY (syrupy voice) Jane's wunnnderful. \nJANE picks up his toothbrush. \nJANE (hands it to him) Here. Brush them good, Marty. Some of that shit in your head might leak down into your mouth and poison you. \nNAN Jane Coslaw! \nBut JANE stalks off. MARTY is grinning. It was a good put-down. \nEXT.  THE STURMFULLER HOUSE  NIGHT \nWe can see the moon in the sky beyond the ruined greenhouse. \nTHE CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY TOWARD the greenhouse. We begin to pick up SOUNDS: RATTLING...RUSTLING...and low animal GRUNTS. \nINT.  TAMMY'S BEDROOM  NIGHT \nShe's deeply asleep. \nINT.  THE LIVING ROOM  NIGHT \n\"Big-time Wrestling\" on the TV. SOUND of a refrigerator door closing. MILT STURMFULLER comes into the living room from the kitchen. He's wearing his long johns with the designer pee stains and has a quart bottle of Rheingold the dry beer in each hand. He sits down, looking at the TV. \nMILT (drunk) Give him the airplane! Wring his neck! \nEXT.  THE GREENHOUSE  NIGHT \nMore noises. There is a beat of silence, and then something- one of those earthen plant pots, I think- falls over and SHATTERS. \nINT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH MILT \nHe looks up briefly- he's heard something- but the crowd on the TV is loud and the match is reaching its climax. \nMILT (all eyes again) Give him the sleeper, you fuckin bugwit! \nEXT.  THE GREENHOUSE, CLOSER \nA LOW SNARL. Plants shake and shiver. Another crash, LOUDER. \nINT.  MILT, IN THE LIVING ROOM \nLooks toward the window. He gets up, goes over, and looks out. \nEXT.  THE GREENHOUSE, MEDIUM-LONG (MILT'S POV) \nSOUND of another crash. Plants move. \nINT.  THE HALL, WITH MILT \nHe takes a shotgun from the wall, breaks it, and looks inside. \nMILT Let's see if you want to come back and break my pots all to shit after I put some rock salt in your asses! \nINT.  THE STURMFULLER GREENHOUSE  NIGHT \nThe door at the end SCREECHES OPEN and MILT, still holding the shotgun at port arms, comes cautiously in. This place is really overgrown. \nINT.  BILLY McCLAREN, AT THE BAR \nHe's looking toward the table where the Fairton group sits. \nBILLY (mildly) Last town report said you was in arrears your taxes, Andy. Guess you must have paid up, huh? \nINT.  THE FAIRTON TABLE \nANDY What are you, trying to be smart? \nOWEN KNOPFLER comes over. \nOWEN You guys turn down the thermostat or I'm gonna turn you all out. Now who's drinking? \nANDY (sulks) Bring me a Schlitz. \nEXT.  A TREE, WITH BRADY'S SMILE-KITE STUCK IN IT  DUSK \nSOUND of panting. \nMARTY comes into the frame, pulling himself up by the arms. His arms are very strong, although his legs trail limply behind him (like the tail of a kite). He sits on a branch, untangles the kite and the string, and looks down. \nMARTY (calls) Here it comes! \nEXT.  THE FOOT OF THE TREE, WITH BRADY \nBRADY Drop it! \nAs the kite flutters down, JANE comes biking up. \nJANE Marty Coslaw, you get down out of that tree! \nEXT.  MARTY, IN THE TREE \nHe descends, then hangs from the lowest branch. \nMARTY Push the Bullet over, Jane, okay? \nEXT.  MARTY AND JANE \nJANE (makes no immediate move to do so) Supper was an hour ago, Dumbo. \nMARTY (hanging) Oh, Jeez! I forgot! Is she mad? \nJANE They both are. At me, for not getting you sooner. I ought to let you fall. \nBut she pushes the chair over and MARTY drops into it. He pushes the starter and the Silver Bullet fires up. \nEXT.  BRADY, FLYING HIS KITE ON THE COMMON  DUSK \nMARTY (voice) Hey, Brady! You coming? \nBRADY (looking into the sky) In a while! \nBRADY could give a shit if MARTY'S in trouble. He just waves vaguely. He's into the kite-flying experience, as the folks in Marin County might say. \nEXT.  MARTY AND JANE \nHe's looking toward the common, frowning and uncertain. \nJANE Come on, Marty. \nShe starts biking away. MARTY starts after her, pauses, and looks at: \nEXT.  BRADY, ON THE COMMON  DUSK \nCAMERA PANS SLOWLY UP to the yellow smile-kite in the bluish-purple sky. \nINT.  OWEN'S PUB  LATE DUSK \nThe former patrons are still here, with the exceptions of LOWE, BILLY McCLAREN, and BOBBY ROBERTSON. Many others have appeared; this is Happy Hour. Among them we see MR. ASPINALL, the principal, and PELTZER, the druggist. A barmaid, NORMA, circulates with drinks and beers. \nSpeaking of beer, ANDY FAIRTON has gotten through a fair amount of Schlitz. It hasn't mellowed him, however; he's more belligerent than ever. \nANDY (holding forth) This whole investigation has been as efficient as a Polish fire drill! It- \nPETE (bravely) I've heard enough out of you, Andy. If you don't shut your mouth, I'm going to shut it for you. \nINT.  THE DOOR OF OWEN'S PLACE \nIt opens and a man in a business suit- HERB KINCAID- comes in. He is carrying a briefcase and he looks worried. \nINT.  THE GROUP AT THE FAIRTON TABLE \nANDY (astounded) What did you say? \nINT.  THE BAR, WITH OWEN KNOPFLER \nOWEN Jesus wept. \nHe reaches under the bar and comes out with a baseball bat. Burned into the side of the bat, so it reads vertically toward the handle, is the word \"peacemaker.\" OWEN hurries around the bar with it. \nINT.  THE FAIRTON GROUP \nPETE is standing in front of ANDY, fists balled up, fat face trembling with determination. \nPETE You heard what I said, motormouth. \nHERB KINCAID appears. He is laughing. He is smeared with his son's blood. In each hand he holds one of his son's shoes. \nHERB We'll bury his shoes because his feet are still in them and they're the only part of him that makes sense anymore. \nHERB laughs harder. \nHERB It's gonna be the cheapest funeral this town ever saw! \nHERB SCREAMS LAUGHTER. THE CAMERA DOLLIES IN TO CLOSE ON BRADY'S KITE. \nEXT.  THE MOON, CU \nSOUND: HERB SCREAMING. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.  HOLY FAMILY CHURCH  DAY \nSOUND: An organ is playing that sweet old hymn, \"Bringing In The Sheaves.\" \nThere are lots of cars parked in front of the church, but there's a space left just big enough for UNCLE AL'S MG. MARTY'S Silver Bullet is strapped to the back. \nJANE (v-o) My mother and father- my mother in particular- did not much care for Uncle Al... \nINT.  HOLY FAMILY CHURCH  DAY \nMARTY'S chair is at the back of the church. Most of the mourners are crying. MRS. BOWIE is playing the organ. BRADY'S coffin is on a bier at the front - closed of course. There are lots of flowers. \nJANE (v-o continues) ...but when it came to such unpleasant duties as taking Marty to the funeral of his best friend... \nINT.  UNCLE AL, MARTY, TAMMY, AND MRS. STURMFULLER IN A PEW \nAs we look at them, from left to right: UNCLE AL, MARTY, TAMMY, MRS. STURMFULLER. \nUNCLE AL unobtrusively takes a small silver flask from his hip pocket. Engraved on it in Old English letters is the word \"rotgut.\" He spins the cap and takes a quick knock. He pauses and glances at MARTY, who looks deeply stunned. \nJANE (v-o continues) ...they didn't at all mind drafting him. As to the sort of comfort Uncle Al may have been able to offer him... \nUNCLE AL hands the flask to MARTY. MARTY looks at him questioningly for a moment, and then drinks. MARTY looks at TAMMY, who looks frankly terrible. Her mother is looking away. MARTY nudges her. She looks around at him. He offers her the flask. Her eyes widen. \nJANE (v-o continues) ...I now believe that was best kept between the two of them... \nAfter a brief moment's consideration, TAMMY takes the flask and has a deep swallow. She hands the flask back to MARTY, who hands it quickly back to UNCLE AL as TAMMY coughs. Her mother looks at her... then at MARTY and UNCLE AL. UNCLE AL smiles sympathetically, hiding the flask with one hand, as if to say, \"Isn't it a terrible thing?\" MRS. STURMFULLER looks distractedly back toward the service. \nJANE (v-o concludes) ...or among the three of them. \nUNCLE AL pockets the flask just as the organ stops playing. \nINT.  THE PODIUM, WITH FATHER LOWE \nLOWE Mr. and Mrs. Kincaid have asked that there be no mass said here this afternoon. There will be a requiem mass for Brady Kincaid this Sunday. They did ask me to say a word of comfort to you, if I could. \nHe looks out at them. \nINT.  THE CONGREGATION \nThey look back at LOWE, hoping for some help in understanding this awful thing. \nINT.  LOWE, ABOVE THE COFFIN \nLOWE If there is any word of comfort I can give you, it's just this: the face of the beast always becomes known; the time of the beast always passes. \nHe is struggling with this, trying dreadfully hard. \nLOWE If there are times when we feel alone and afraid, only small creatures in the dark, then these are the times when we must turn to one another for our comfort and our hope. To our neighbors. To our community. To our love for each other. I alone cannot ease the pain for Herb and Naomi Kincaid, nor can I ease your pain, nor you ease mine. But if I believe anything it's this: we can comfort each other. We can heal each other. We can go on together. \nINT.  THE CONGREGATION, WITH MARTY AND TAMMY \nThe kids are crying. MARTY puts an arm around TAMMY and she puts her head on his shoulder. \nINT.  FATHER LOWE \nLOWE The Bible tells us not to fear the terror that creepeth by night or that which flieth by noonday, and yet we do... we do. Because there is much we don't know, and we feel very small. But we must not be alone. We must not allow ourselves to be alone, for there is the wide gate to the hell of terror. Turn to each other. Join hands in your sorrow and try to remember that the face of the beast always becomes known. (Pause) The time of the beast always passes. (Pause) Let us pray. \nEXT.  THE MOURNERS, WITH MARTY \nMARTY and TAMMY look at each other miserably. TAMMY begins to cry- for her father as much as for BRADY, one would think- and she and MARTY embrace. \nEXT.  UNCLE AL, CU \nHe looks at the kids with deep sympathy and deep love. \nEXT.  A COUNTRY ROAD  AFTERNOON \nUNCLE AL'S sports car passes THE CAMERA. He's taking MARTY home. \nINT.  THE CAR, WITH MARTY AND UNCLE AL \nUNCLE AL You all right, Marty? \nMARTY Yeah. \nUNCLE AL There's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You ever hear that one? \nMARTY No. \nUNCLE AL Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy. \nIt's not working. Many of the men look disgusted with both ANDY and themselves. \nANDY (louder) He ain't got so much as a fingerprint! \nOWEN KNOPFLER Ah, shut up, Andy. \nANDY Don't tell me to- \nHERB KINCAID steps forward. \nHERB Yes. Correct. Shut up. \nANDY, surprised and bewildered, does. HERB turns and looks grimly at JOE HALLER, who can barely meet his gaze. \nHERB (quietly) I just came from my boy's funeral. \nHALLER Herb...I know how upset- how grief-stricken you must be...but- \nHERB (quietly) He was torn apart. \nUtter silence in OWEN'S place now. The others are staring, rapt. \nHALLER Yes. Yes, but- \nHERB (still quiet) Upset, you say. Grief-stricken, you say. Constable, you don't know what those words mean. My son was torn to pieces. To pieces! \nHERB turns to the others in the pub. Tears stream down his face. \nHERB My son was torn to pieces! (turning back to HALLER) You come in here and talk to these men about private justice. You dare to do that. Constable Haller, why don't you go out to Harmony Hill and dig up what's left of Brady and explain to him about private justice. Would you want to do that? \nHALLER makes no reply. He looks down at his feet. \nHERB No. I thought not. (to the others) You folks stay here if you want. I wouldn't ask anyone to do anything that runs counter to his conscience. As for me... I'm going out and hunt up a little private justice. \nANDY FAIRTON has swelled up again. He grins poisonously at the slumped HALLER. He pushes off after HERB KINCAID. Other men start to follow. \nEXT.  OWEN'S PUB \nMen are streaming out, getting into station wagons and pickup trucks. Engines roar into life. They begin backing out even as more men come out of the pub. We even hear some high-spirited yells; they are on their way and their blood is up. \nINT.  OWEN'S PUB \nLESTER LOWE, looking more distressed than ever, pushes his way through the men toward the door, and THE CAMERA FOLLOWS. He grabs BILLY McCLAREN. \nLOWE Billy... Billy, this is a bad idea. Joe can... \nBILLY (not looking at LOWE) Joe's had his chance, Father. Leave me be. \nHe pushes outside. LOWE looks around wildly; his face says he can't believe this is happening. He grabs PORTER ZINNEMAN, then, as PORTER shoves by him, at a couple of others with mounting desperation. \nHALLER makes his way to LOWE through the thinning crowd and draws him aside. \nHALLER Let them go. \nLOWE But- \nHALLER This is that spirit of community you were talking about. Grand, ain't it? Maybe they'll shoot a hitchhiker or something and Andy can mount the head and raffle it off. To benefit the Medcu van, of course. \nHALLER laughs. \nLOWE But can't we do anything? \nOWEN KNOPFLER hurries past them; he has a rifle over one shoulder in a sling. In his left hand he carries the peacemaker bat. \nHALLER Sure. We can pray to Christ that none of them get killed. \nEXT.  OUTSIDE OWEN'S \nMore cars and trucks pull away. There's a big old Ford \"woody\" wagon still there, with ANDY FAIRTON standing impatiently by the driver's side door. BILLY McCLAREN and BOBBY ROBERTSON are with him, and a big, solid-looking woman named MAGGIE ANDREWS. \nOWEN comes out and crosses to the woody. \nANDY Well, it's about frigging time! They'll have his hide tacked to somebody's barn door before we get out there! \nThey pile into the car, ANDY behind the wheel. He throws it into gear and backs out onto Main Street. \nEXT.  MAIN STREET, A NEW ANGLE \nWe see a parade of cars and pickup trucks headed out of town. \nEXT.  FATHER LESTER LOWE \nHe's standing on the curb and watching them leave town in procession, some honking their horns, others yelling cheerfully. The expression on his face is dark and brooding. \nEXT.  THE FULL MOON, CU  NIGHT \nEXT.  ELMER AND PORTER ZINNEMAN  NIGHT \nELMER is lying on his belly, stuck halfway under a barbed-wire fence. The seat of his pants is badly snagged. The brothers are on the verge of a wooded area. We can see ground mist creeping around the bottoms of the trees. \nELMER Help me Porter, goddammit! \nPORTER grabs ELMER'S right arm and pulls. There's a RIPPING SOUND. ELMER screams. \nELMER Don't pull me! You want to rip the right cheek of my ass right off? \nPORTER Well, Elmer, there are folks that'd say you've been half-assed most of your- \nINT.  LOWE \nHe looks toward: \nINT.  THE MRS. BOWIE WEREWOLF, AT THE ORGAN \nShe grins ferociously up at him, playing the Rheingold jingle on the pipe organ with her claws. Now blood begins to bubble up between the keys. \nMRS. STURMFULLER AND ALL Won't you try, won't you buy... \nINT.  THE ENTIRE CONGREGATION \nThe church is a wild shambles of lurching, fighting, singing werewolves. It's like a New Year's Eve party in hell. \nCONGREGATION (big finish) ...Rheiinngold beer! \nSuddenly a clawed hand burts up through one of the coffins. And ANDY FAIRTON, who now looks as wolflike as any of them, bites the hand's claw off. \nINT.  REV. LOWE, ON THE PODIUM \nHe's seen all he can stand. He whirls for the back, where there is a small door. He pulls it open... and a BRADY KINCAID werewolf, half torn apart but still somehow alive (a zombie werewolf, if you can dig it- George Romero would like it, I think) leaps out and seizes LOWE. \nBRADY buries his muzzle in LOWE'S NECK. \nINT.  LESTER LOWE, ECU \nHe sits up into THE CAMERA and SCREAMS. Sweat is running down his face. He stares at us for a moment, his eyes buggy and crazed... and then he closes them. There is an expression of huge relief on his face as he does so. \nLOWE (praying) Let it end, dear Lord. Let it end. Please let it end. \nEXT.  MAIN STREET  DAY \nAn old sedan cruises slowly down the street. ANNE and TAMMY STURMFULLER are in the front seat. It's piled high with possessions and is towing a jackleg trailer with more stuff in it. \nEXT.  HALLER AND PETE \nHALLER (indifferently) Anne Sturmfuller and her little girl. \nPETE Yeah... but what are they doing? \nHALLER Putting on my Sherlock Holmes deerstalker cap, I deduce that they are leaving. \nEXT.  THE STURMFULLER CAR, THE COPS' POV  DAY \nThey are headed out of town all right, but the thing which perhaps strikes us the most forcibly is how empty this place is now. Main Street looks like a ghost town. \nEXT. JOE HALLER AND PETE SYLVESTER, ON THE SIDEWALK \nHALLER She's not the only one. Lot of people leaving town. And I guess if we want a beer, we'll have to drink it at home. \nHe nods toward: \nEXT.  OWEN'S PUB, LONG (PETE AND HALLER'S POV) \nA CLOSED sign hangs in the door; above it is a big black wreath. \nEXT.  HALLER AND PETE \nPETE Joe, what's wrong with you? I ain't never seen you like this. \nHALLER (thoughtful) I lost my guts. \nPETE (startled) Bullshit. \nHALLER It was the Kincaid boy. I looked at him... and I felt it happen. It was no big deal. No worse than pissing down your own leg. You ever do that? Maybe when you were real scared? \nPETE, distressed, does not respond. \nHALLER One minute I had me some guts- as much as the next man, anyhow- and then, poof. Gone. \nPETE'S looking at him in a kind of terror. \nPETE Joe... you are going to feel better than this. This... this feeling of yours... it's gonna pass... \nJOE Is it? \nHe walks away, back toward the Municipal Building (the sign out front reminds folks to SUPPORT THE MEDCU VAN!) while PETE looks after him, very deeply troubled. \nEXT.  A FAIRGROUND  DAY \nIt's deserted. Rides stand still. The midway is deserted. \nTHE CAMERA PANS slowly to a sign which reads TARKER'S MILLS FAIRGROUNDS GALA FAIR OCTOBER 1 FIREWORKS AT DUSK 10c ON EVERY DOLLAR GOES TO THE MEDCU VAN FUND! \nA cheerful enough sign, except for the strip of paper glued diagonally across it: FIREWORKS CANCELED. MARTY (voice) It's not fair. \nINT.  THE COSLAW FAMILY STATION WAGON  DAY \nIt's parked across the road from the sign. \nJANE (voice) Look out, world! Marty the Great didn't get something he wanted! \nThey are distributed just as they were when they arrived at this same fairgrounds earlier. All of them have ice cream cones; they are coming home from a family outing. \nNAN COSLAW Stop it, Jane. \nJANE Well, I don't see why everybody just about breaks down and cries whenever he- \nSOUND: Hurt, angry growl. \nEXT.  MARTY, IN THE REST AREA \nHe's getting ready to light one of the fountains. He pauses and looks toward the cut. He's heard something- but the waterfall muffles it. He lights the fountain's fuse, sets it on the ground, and rolls the Bullet back a few feet. \nThe fountain bursts into a shower of light. \nMARTY (delighted) All right! \nEXT.  THE SLOPE OF THE CUT, MEDIUM LONG \nThe waterfall is in the b.g. \nThe WEREWOLF is climbing the rocky slope. \nEXT.  THE FOUNTAIN, CU \nIt goes out. \nEXT.  MARTY \nHe rolls over to the picnic table and gets a Roman candle. He plants the stick in the ground and lights the fuse. The Roman candle shoots into the sky. \nEXT.  THE ROMAN CANDLE \nBursts into colored light. \nEXT.  THE WEREWOLF, NEAR THE TOP OF THE CUT, MEDIUM LONG \nIt GROWLS... and shakes its fists at the fading light in the sky. \nEXT.  MARTY \nHe's holding another fountain in one hand and his matches in the other. He's looking toward the cut and the waterfall. \nMARTY Is someone there? \nEXT.  THE WEREWOLF, NEAR THE TOP OF THE CUT \nIt freezes, GROWLING FAINTLY. \nEXT.  MARTY \nWith a little shrug, he lights the fuse on the fountain and sets it on the ground, as before. \nEXT.  THE BACK OF THE GROVE, AT THE TOP OF THE CUT \nClaw-hands settle over the top. \nEXT.  THE FOUNTAIN, CU \nIt throws off fiery swirls of sparks, then begins to die down. \nEXT.  MARTY \nHe's checking out the stuff on the table for his next choice when he hears a clear SOUND: A SNAPPING, SPLINTERING BRANCH. \nEXT.  THE GROVE, WITH THE WEREWOLF \nIt's run into a low-hanging branch. Instead of pushing it aside or ducking under it, it simply rips it off the tree. Although the branch is pretty big, the WEREWOLF does this as easily as a hungry man might rip a drumstick off a Thanksgiving turkey. It throws the branch aside and advances, hunched over on two legs. \nEXT.  MARTY \nMARTY (terrified) Who's there? \nEXT.  THE GROVE AT THE BACK OF THE REST AREA, MARTY'S POV \nThe grove is a darkened shadowland. \nEXT.  MARTY \nHe punches the Bullet's starter. The motor cranks and cranks. No go, though. MARTY pulls out the choke wire, alternating terrified stares at the grove of trees with terrified stares at his rudimentary dashboard. \nEXT.  THE GROVE, MARTY'S POV \nHere it comes, out of the shadows, closing in. \nEXT.  MARTY \nWorking that starter for all it's worth... but the motor only cranks. Still no start. \nEXT.  CLAWED, FURRY FEET \nEXT.  MARTY \nHe gives up on the motor. He looks toward the picnic table where the fireworks are. He grabs up the tracer. He gets the matches out of the breast pocket of his p.j.'s and promptly drops them in his lap. He scrabbles for them. \nEXT.  THE WEREWOLF, MARTY'S POV \nWe can't see its face in the dark, but it's closer... much closer. \nEXT.  MARTY \nHe tries to hold the tracer and strike a match at the same time. He can't; to do that he'd need at least one more hand. He puts the tube of the tracer between his teeth and tries again. \nEXT.  THE MATCHBOOK AND MARTY'S HANDS \nHe hangs up and falls back into bed. \nGIRL (muzzy voice) Whowuzzit? \nUNCLE AL Obscene phone caller. Go back to sleep. \nEXT.  THE BACK PORCH, WITH MARTY \nHe's sitting on the Silver Bullet, just looking at the yard. JANE comes out. \nJANE Marty? You okay? You've just been sitting here all morning. \nMARTY Where's Mom? \nJANE Went shopping. Why? \nMARTY Jane, I have to talk to you. \nJANE (mistrustfully) About what? \nMARTY looks at her earnestly. \nMARTY I need you to help me. Uncle Al won't believe me, and if you won't help me, I... I... \nMARTY has to stop. He's almost crying. \nJANE (concerned) Marty, what is it? \nEXT.  MAIN STREET, MEDIUM LONG, WITH JANE \nJANE is pushing a supermarket shopping cart with a lot of beer and soda bottles in it. On the side is a sign reading MEDCU BOTTLE AND CAN DRIVE- plus an outline drawing of the Medcu unit. \nJANE (voice-over) He told me something that was clearly unbelievable... and yet, somehow I believed most of it. And I understood one thing with total clarity: Marty himself believed it all. \nShe turns into a yard and pulls her cart up the walk to the door. She mounts the steps and rings the bell. \nEXT.  THE PORCH, WITH JANE, A CLOSER SHOT \nA sheer curtain at one side of the door is pulled aside and a fearful face- that of MRS. THAYER- looks out. Then we hear bolts being pulled and locks- at least three of them- being unlocked. The lady is taking no chances. \nMRS. THAYER Jane? \nJANE (politely) I'm collecting returnable bottles and cans for the Medcu Drive, Missus Thayer- I just wondered if you had any. \nHer husband comes up the hall. \nMR. THAYER Who is it? \nMRS. THAYER Jane Coslaw. \nEXT.  JANE \nWhat we see mostly are her eyes- bright, inquiring. \nJANE Hi, Mr. Thayer. \nINT.  LON THAYER, ECU \nWhat we see mostly are his brown eyes. \nMR. THAYER Hello, Jane. \nEXT.  THE PORCH, WITH JANE AND MRS. THAYER \nMRS. THAYER Bring your cart around to the back, Jane- we'll look in the garage. \nJANE Thank you. \nShe starts down the steps and we \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.  JANE, ON MAIN STREET  DAY \nAmazing how deserted Tarker's Mills looks. JANE is pushing her cart. Even more bottles in it now. \nJANE (voice-over) Uncle Al hadn't believed him, but Uncle Al was thirty-five that summer and I was fourteen... at fourteen you can still believe the unbelievable, although even then that ability is growing rusty, is preparing to squeal to a stop. \nShe is passing the Holy Family rectory. LESTER LOWE is out front, digging in his flower garden. He is shirtless, back to JANE and to us; his black shirt with the turned-around collar hangs informally on a bush. \nJANE (calls) Hi, Father Lowe! \nLOWE (without turning) Top of the morning to you, Jane Coslaw! \nJANE I'm going to bring in a monster load of bottles in an hour or so! \nLOWE (still digging) That's great, Jane... I'll be waiting. \nEXT.  JANE, FARTHER DOWN MAIN STREET \nShe stops at Robertson's Luncheonette, leaves her cart outside, and goes in. THE CAMERA FLOATS TO THE WINDOW; we see JANE explaining about the bottle campaign to BOBBY while a few men seated at the counter listen. \nINT.  JANE, ECU \nWide eyes, mostly. \nINT.  BOBBY ROBERTSON, ECU \nShe opens the door and slowly pushes her cart inside. \nINT.  THE UTILITY SHED-GARAGE, WITH JANE \nThis is a creepy little place, now filled with bottles and cans that have been crammed in helter-skelter, every which way. JANE obviously doesn't like it. She begins to unload her cart rapidly, mumbling numbers to herself. \nSOUND: SQUEAKING. \nJANE looks down. \nINT.  THE UTILITY SHED-GARAGE FLOOR, JANE'S POV \nA good-sized mouse comes out from between a pile of stacked bottles and runs across JANE'S shoe. \nINT.  JANE \nShe utters a litle scream and shrinks back against the wall, bumping it quite hard. Hard enough to knock something off an overhead shelf. It falls into the bottles, SHATTERING several. JANE screams again- not terribly loud- and then slowly bends toward the object and picks it up. \nJANE holds it, both puzzled and scared. \nEXT.  THE BACK DOOR OF THE RECTORY \nJANE approaches it, holding a piece of paper in her hand- her tally sheet. She knocks. Waits. There is no answer. She knocks again. Waits. No answer. She tries the door. It opens. \nJANE Father Lowe? \nNo answer. After a moment of interior debate, JANE enters the kitchen. \nINT.  JANE, IN THE RECTORY KITCHEN \nShe looks around. No one here. But there is a bloody spot on the counter- LOWE must have set his grisly luncheon down here for a moment. She walks slowly across the kitchen and into the dark hall. \nJANE Father Lowe?... I've got my tally sheet... \nFarther into the hall. A hand drops onto her shoulder. \nLOWE (voice) Very good, Jane! \nShe jumps, and so do we. She turns around and looks up at: \nINT.  FATHER LOWE, ECU \nFeaturing his eyes- his eye, rather. The left is covered with a black eye-patch. \nLOWE (grins) Good, Jane. Very... very good. \nHe holds his hand out, and JANE puts the tally sheet in it like one in a dream. She can't take her eyes off that black patch, which tells her everything. \nINT.  THE HALLWAY, WITH JANE AND LOWE \nLOWE (concerned) Jane! You're trembling! \nJANE I... I don't feel so well, I guess maybe I got too much sun. \nLOWE Would you like to come in the parlor and lie down for a bit? Or have a cold drink? I have some soda- \nJANE No! (softer) That is, I have to get home and help my mom with lunch. \nLOWE I'll give you a ride! \nJANE is retreating down the hall toward the front door. \nJANE No- she... she was going to meet me at the market. I'll be fine. \nINT.  LOWE, CU \nHow much does he know? How much has he guessed? Hard to tell from his face, which now seems sinister, with its eye-patch. \nLOWE Give my best to your brother, Jane. \nINT.  JANE, AT THE PORCH END OF THE HALLWAY \nJANE I will. \nShe bolts. \nINT.  LOWE, IN THE HALLWAY \nCAMERA HOLDS ON HIM, standing silent and enigmatic. \nLOWE (soft) Real slow. \nEXT.  THE COSLAW BACKYARD, WITH MARTY \nHis eyes are wide. He's leaning forward in his wheelchair. \nMARTY (almost moaning) Oh, Jeez! What did you do then? \nEXT.  JANE AND MARTY \nShe's changed into shorts and a blouse. \nJANE I ran faster than I ever ran in my life- what do you think, dummox? By the time I got back here, I really thought I was going to faint. (Pause) What are we going to do, Marty? If we tried to tell anybody- grown-ups, I mean- they'd laugh. What are we going to do? \nMARTY (thoughtfully) I think I know. \nINT.  A SHEET OF RULED SCHOOL NOTEBOOK PAPER, CU \nUNCLE AL stops. He hasn't thought of this. He looks toward: \nEXT.  THE CATHOLIC RECTORY, LONG - UNCLE AL'S POV \nLESTER LOWE is mowing the lawn, eye-patch and all. \nEXT.  MAIN STREET, WITH UNCLE AL, MARTY, AND JANE \nUNCLE AL (a bit perplexed) Well... he probably did. I mean, he could make a complaint without taking an ad out in the paper, couldn't he? \nMARTY I'll bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff was nonprescription. And I'll bet you another quarter he hasn't said anything to Mr. Haller. \nUNCLE AL Marty, do you see your suspect? \nEXT.  THE RECTORY LAWN, WITH LESTER LOWE \nKeeps on moving. MR. ASPINALL drives by and waves. LOWE waves back. \nEXT.  MAIN STREET, WITH UNCLE AL, MARTY, AND JANE \nMARTY (grim) Yes, I see him. \nUNCLE AL Do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn? He'd either be in the hospital... or dead. \nMARTY I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was- \nUNCLE AL When he was a werewolf. Yes. Right. Jesus. Jane, you don't really believe this madness, do you? \nJANE I don't know exactly what I believe. But I know that what I saw was a baseball bat and not a broomstick. I know there was something strange about the way the house smelled that day. It smelled like an animal's den. And I believe in Marty. I mean- there are times when he makes me so mad I could kill him, but I still believe in him. (Pause) You used to believe in him, too, Uncle Al. \nUNCLE AL looks momentarily ashamed of himself. Then he throws his hands up in disgust. \nUNCLE AL Kids! \nHe walks ahead of them. MARTY bats his eyes sweetly at JANE. \nShe walks on, miffed. MARTY gooses the Silver Bullet to catch up. \nEXT.  A FIELD ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN  DAY \nIt's midafternoon. A bunch of kids are playing baseball. In the extreme f.g. we see one small boy- MARTY- sitting back to us in his wheelchair, watching. \nEXT.  AN OLD COUPE \nIt draws slowly along a tree-lined lane and stops. LESTER LOWE is behind the wheel. \nSOUNDS OF THE BASEBALL GAME CONTINUE. \nEXT.  THE BASEBALL FIELD, AND MARTY, LOWE'S POV \nTHE CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN ON MARTY'S BACK. \nEXT.  LESTER LOWE \nLOWE (quietly) Little bastard. \nEXT.  A FLY BALL \nEXT.  THE FIELD, A WIDER SHOT \nThe field team heads in. Kids start streaming back toward town. \nEXT.  MARTY \nThe OUTFIELDER who caught the fly trots past, and glances his way. \nOUTFIELDER You comin' down to Robertson's for a soda, Marty? \nMARTY No- I guess I'll go home. \nI think that here we are seeing a rare moment of depression in MARTY- they can run and play ball. He can't. \nOUTFIELDER Okay- seeya! \nMARTY Yeah... seeya. \nHe fires up the Bullet and starts away alone. \nEXT.  LOWE'S COUPE \nHe starts it up. \nEXT.  MARTY, LOWE'S POV \nHe bumps up a grassy slope to a tarred road. The last of the other kids are headed back the other way. MARTY is alone. \nEXT.  LOWE'S COUPE \nIt turns out of the lane where it was parked and onto the road. \nEXT.  MARTY'S WHEELCHAIR, LOWE'S POV \nMARTY'S back is to us. The wheelchair draws rapidly closer to THE CAMERA as LOWE bears down on it. \nINT.  LOWE, BEHIND THE COUPE'S WHEEL \nHe leans over the wheel, grinning sadistically. \nIt overshoots the right turn MARTY just took, screeches to a halt, backs up, and turns onto the lane. \nEXT.  THE SILVER BULLET \nIt bounces up the incline to the bridge, MOTOR COUGHING AND SPLUTTERING. \nEXT.  THE COUPE \nIt comes to a sliding, dirt-digging stop. \nINT.  LOWE, BEHIND THE WHEEL \nHis face is so full of frustrated hate that it has become the face of a gargoyle. \nEXT.  THE SIGN PROHIBITING MOTOR TRAFFIC, LOWE'S POV \nEXT./INT.  THE COVERED BRIDGE, WITH THE BULLET \nIt's dim and spooky in here. Cracks between the boards of the side walls allow dusty fingers of daylight to shine through. More light rays up from the cracks in the floor. The floorboards are warped and uneven; MARTY'S wheelchair sways drunkenly from side to side. The total inside passage is about seventy feet. \nAbout halfway across, the Silver Bullet coughs its last cough and splutters its last splutter. It rolls along silently, going on its dying momentum. \nEXT.  THE FAR END OF THE BRIDGE, MARTY'S POV \nDrawing closer. We hear the SOUNDS of boards rumbling under the Silver Bullet's tires and the Auger River beneath. \nEXT.  MARTY, REVERSE \nRolling ever more slowly, the Silver Bullet approaches THE CAMERA... and stops. MARTY is covered with sweat. His hair is in a wild tangle. He's panting. He looks at: \nEXT.  THE LANE LEADING AWAY FROM THE BRIDGE, MARTY'S POV \nThis is an extremely rustic lane. Pretty, but hardly the sort of place in which one would want to find oneself when one has a part-time werewolf and a full-time homicidal maniac close behind. \nEXT.  MARTY, AT THE MOUTH OF THE BRIDGE \nLOWE (soft voice) Marty... \nMARTY'S head whips around. \nEXT.  THE FAR END OF THE BRIDGE, MARTY'S POV \nWe see a brilliant square of light. In it stands LOWE'S silhouette. The silhouette begins to move. SOUND of footfalls on the loose floorboards of the covered bridge. \nINT.  LOWE'S SHOES \nSensible black Oxfords. \nLOWE I'm very sorry about this. I don't know if you believe that or not, but it's true. I would never willingly hurt a child. You should have left me alone, Marty. \nSOUND of footfalls resumes. \nEXT.  MARTY \nHe's nearly paralyzed with terror- even if he wasn't, he wouldn't get far in a powerless Silver Bullet. \nINT.  LOWE, IN THE SHADOWS \nLOWE (soft; soothing) I can't kill myself, Marty. You see, our religion teaches that suicide is the greatest sin a man or a woman can commit. Stella Randolph was going to commit suicide; if she had done so, she would be burning in hell right now. By killing her I took her physical life but saved her life eternal. You see, Marty? You see how all things serve the will and the mind of God? You see, you meddling little shit! \nHe begins to walk forward again. \nEXT.  LOWE, MARTY'S POV \nHe's halfway across the bridge now, walking slowly, not hurrying. \nLOWE You're going to have a terrible accident, Marty. You're going to fall into the river. \nSOUND: TRACTOR ENGINE. LOWE stops, alert to possible danger. \nEXT.  MARTY \nTRACTOR SOUND IS LOUDER. \nMARTY'S face fills with hope. He looks from LOWE toward: \nEXT.  THE LANE, MARTY'S POV \nTHE TRACTOR SOUND gets louder still, and here comes ELMER ZINNEMAN on a John Deere. The tractor is hauling a manure spreader which is mostly empty. \nEXT.  MARTY \nMARTY (waving madly) Mr. Zinneman! Mr. Zinneman! \nINT.  THE COVERED BRIDGE, WITH LOWE \nHe draws back a little, and his face is sharp with animal cunning- inside his head he's running a four-minute mile. Stay and try to bluff it out, or beat it? \nEXT.  ELMER AND MARTY \nELMER draws the tractor up close to MARTY and swings it around. MARTY looks back at: \nINT.  THE COVERED BRIDGE, MARTY'S POV \nEmpty. \nSOUND OF A CAR STARTING, FAINT. \nThey shake hands. \nEXT.  THE RECTORY  NIGHT \nA Chevrolet with TARKER'S MILLS CONSTABLE painted on the side in gold leaf pulls up. JOE HALLER gets out, and as he does there's a business of pulling his pants legs down over his boots- nice stitched cowboy boots, not black cop's shoes. We want the audience to notice these boots, remember them- probably HALLER should wear them all through the picture. He goes up the walk. \nHALLER rings the doorbell. \nNo one comes. HALLER rings the bell again. Waits. No one comes. He leans down and looks through a side window. \nINT.  THE RECTORY HALL AND SITTING ROOM, HALLER'S POV \nNo one there. \nEXT.  HALLER \nHe goes down the steps, stands on the path for a moment, and then goes over to the shed-garage. He opens the door and looks in. \nEXT./INT.  THE GARAGE, HALLER'S POV \nLOWE'S coupe is in there. There's just room for it amid the shadowy piles of bottles and cans. \nINT.  THE GARAGE, WITH HALLER \nHe goes around to the front of LOWE'S coupe and squats down. In the b.g.: a heaped mountain of aluminum beer and soda cans. \nHALLER feels in his breast pocket and brings out a Zippo. He lights it and looks at: \nINT.  THE COUPE, CU \nOne of the turn-signal lamps is broken. There's a scratch in the paint and a dent in the bumper. HALLER'S fingers come into the frame and touch the scratch. They stop, and THE CAMERA ZOOMS IN to a small streak of silvery paint. As MARTY has a scrape of blue car paint on his wheelchair, so does LOWE have a scrape of silver wheelchair paint on his car. \nINT.  HALLER \nHis eyes widen. \nSOUND: SHATTERING ROAR and the CLINK AND TUMBLE of about nine thousand cans as LOWE erupts from under the aluminum scrap heap behind HALLER. He is a mixture of man and werewolf, and quite clearly a beastial version of LOWE. In one hand he holds the remains of OWEN KNOPFLER'S peacemaker. \nHALLER starts to turn; LOWE strikes him with the bat. CAMERA CLOSES IN ON LOWE as the bat rises and falls... rises and falls. We can't see HALLER, and that is probably a mercy, but we can hear the THUD of the bat as it strikes again and again and again. \nEXT.  THE REST AREA AT AUGER FALLS, WITH MARTY, AL, JANE DAY \nUNCLE AL has taken the Coslaw family station wagon today. The three of them are sitting in the grove of trees. \nMARTY Mr. Haller said he'd check him out, and guess what? No one sees him again! \nUNCLE AL And what do you suggest I do about it, dear boy? \nMARTY slips off his St. Christopher's medallion and hands it to UNCLE AL. \nMARTY I want you to turn this into a silver bullet. \nUNCLE AL You're not going to let it go, are you? \nMARTY I saw what I saw. \nUNCLE AL Marty, the moon wasn't even full! \nJANE (quietly) In the made-up stories, the guy who's the werewolf only changes when the moon is full. But maybe he's really that way almost all the time, only as the moon gets fuller... \nMARTY (finishes) ...the guy gets wolfier. \nJANE (hands AL her crucifix) Here. Take mine, too. \nMARTY Jane... you don't have to do that. \nJANE Don't tell me what I have to do and what I don't, booger-brains. \nMARTY Will you marry me, Jane? \nUNCLE AL Would you kids mind telling me how this guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with? \nJANE I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either. \nMARTY No one knows how cancer begins, either- or exactly what it is- but people still believe in it. \nUNCLE AL The kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit. \nMARTY I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe. \nUNCLE AL Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind. \nMARTY Will you do it? \nUNCLE AL only looks at him, confused and unsure. \nEXT.  A COUNTRY ROAD, WITH THE COSLAW STATION WAGON  DAY \nUNCLE AL is taking the kids home- THE CAMERA TRACKS the wagon for a moment, and then we are looking up the short lane and into a gravel pit. \nTHE CAMERA ZOOMS IN, FAST, on the sandy rear wall. We can see one cowboy boot sticking out of a wall of sand. It's bloody and chewed. \nEXT.  THE COSLAW DRIVEWAY  DAY \nThe wagon pulls in. \nINT.  THE CAR, WITH MARTY, JANE, AND UNCLE AL \nINT.  THE STATION WAGON, WITH BOB AND NAN \nBOB I can't believe that you'd agree to leave the kids with him. A year ago I would have laughed at the idea. You used to almost breathe fire when Al came in the house. \nNAN He's changed. Just this summer. Or something's changed him. Marty, maybe. And the drinking- I think it's almost stopped. Whatever it is, it's wonderful. And they'll be safe with him. I'm sure of it. \nBOB I know they'll be safe with him... but will he get them both into bed by nine-thirty? \nNAN (firmly) If I told him to, he will. \nINT.  THE WALL CLOCK IN THE COSLAW LIVING ROOM  NIGHT \nIt reads 1:00. \nSOUND: The National Anthem. \nINT.  THE TV, CU \nThe anthem finishes up. We go to a station ID card. \nANNOUNCER'S VOICE This concludes WDML's broadcast day. \nThe TV goes to snow. \nINT.  JANE ON THE COUCH \nShe's mostly asleep in one corner. \nINT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET \nHe's also dozing. \nINT.  UNCLE AL, IN BOB'S EASY CHAIR IN FRONT OF THE TV \nHe is also dozing. There are three or four empty beer cans in front of him, and a cigarette with a long ash is smoldering between his fingers. There's a .22 pistol in his lap. \nEXT.  THE COSLAW HOUSE, FROM ONE SIDE \nThe WEREWOLF breaks from the woods and runs across the side yard to a line of high bushes that runs along the side of the house (this is the opposite side from MARTY'S bedroom). \nEXT.  IN THE BUSHES, WITH THE WEREWOLF \nThere is a space in here between the house and the bushes- it's like an animal's run. The WEREWOLF creeps along this, its one eye flaring. \nDIM SOUND OF TV SNOW. \nINT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH MARTY, JANE, AND UNCLE AL \nUNCLE AL jumps up and cries out as the cigarette burns up to his fingers. The .22 falls onto the rug. \nMARTY and JANE also wake up, startled. \nEXT.  IN THE BUSHES, WITH THE WEREWOLF \nIt recoils, eyes gleaming. Foam begins to drip from its jaws. It creeps slowly along toward a window. TV SNOW SOUNDS GROW LOUDER. \nINT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH AL, JANE, MARTY \nUNCLE AL is shaking his burned hand; he picks the cigarette out of his lap and puts it out. \nJANE (sleepy) You'll burn yourself up sometime doing that, Uncle Al. \nUNCLE AL I suppose so. You kids ought to go up to bed. \nMARTY But Uncle Al! You said- \nUNCLE AL I know what I said, Marty- but it's ten past one. He's not coming. \nJANE The moon's not down yet... \nUNCLE AL Damn near. Now I'll sit up with this stupid gun in my lap because I promised, but you two are going to bed. Go on, now, scoot. \nJANE gets up and starts toward the stairs. \nMARTY What if I say no? \nUNCLE AL Then I'd have to kick your ass, dear boy. (more kindly) Go on, now. \nMARTY begins to roll the Silver Bullet toward the stairs, where the stair chair awaits. JANE is waiting for him at the living-room doorway. MARTY sees the gun on the floor and stops. \nMARTY If that'd gone off, it would have been the end of our silver bullet. \nINT.  UNCLE AL \nHe prickles a bit at the unstated criticism. He bends down and picks up the pistol. He opens the cylinder. Five chambers are empty; in one there's a bright silver circle. \nINT.  UNCLE AL \nHe pushes the cylinder plunger, dropping the silver bullet into his hand. \nUNCLE AL See, dear boy? Totally unimpaired. \nBehind him, the WEREWOLF'S head appears in the window, its green eye flaring. \nINT.  BY THE LIVING ROOM DOORWAY, WITH MARTY AND JANE \nMARTY, looking toward UNCLE AL, sees nothing. JANE is looking toward the window and she SCREAMS. \nHis fingers touch the bullet, but that's all. It falls in the heating vent. \nINT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU \nIt's roaring, furious, its one eye flaring. \nINT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WIDE \nUNCLE AL lies senseless against one wall, the front of his shirt bloody. JANE runs into the corner and grabs the pistol. \nThe WEREWOLF picks up the easy chair and throws it through the hole it made coming in. It picks up an end table and hurls it through the TV. Then it sees JANE and starts toward her. \nINT.  JANE, COWERING IN THE CORNER \nINT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU \nComes toward her. \nINT.  JANE IN THE CORNER \nShe makes as if to run one way. \nINT.  JANE AND THE WEREWOLF \nIt's only a couple of feet from her now, but again, it is toying with her- it's making this reeeal slow. \nINT.  THE FIREPLACE TOOLS, CU \nA bloodstained hand grabs a poker. \nINT.  THE WEREWOLF AND JANE \nAs it tenses down to leap at her, UNCLE AL leaps at it and strikes it across the back. It turns, ROARING. \nUNCLE AL hits it between the legs. \nIt BELLOWS and grabs the poker. It bends it and tosses it aside. The glaring, savage expression on its face says that now it will bend UNCLE AL and toss him aside. \nINT.  JANE \nShe breaks out of the corner and runs across the room toward the door. Most of the way there she trips and falls. \nINT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU \nIts head whips around. \nINT.  MARTY, IN THE HALL \nHe's lying full-length. He's got the heater vent's grille off. One arm is down inside. \nMARTY (scream) Janey! The gun! THE GUN! \nINT.  JANE \nShe tosses it awkwardly. \nINT.  THE GUN, SLOW MOTION \nIt slides down the hall floor to MARTY like some strange, awkward shuffleboard disc, its cylinder still open. \nINT.  THE WEREWOLF \nWEREWOLF (snarls) Maa-aaa-rty... \nIt begins walking slowly across the living room, smashing things out of its way. \nINT.  MARTY, IN THE HALL \nThe gun slides into his hand. Now he reaches into the heating duct again... \nINT.  IN THE HEATING DUCT, ECU \nThere's an elbow bend just below MARTY'S twisting, grasping fingers- the silver bullet lies here. It's less than half an inch out of reach. \nINT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU \nWEREWOLF (foaming) Maaa-aaa-rty... \nINT.  JANE, ON THE FLOOR \nJANE (sobbing) Don't you hurt him! Don't you hurt my brother! \nShe bites one of the WEREWOLF'S hairy ankles as it passes. \nINT.  JANE AND THE WEREWOLF \nIt roars with pain and kicks her aside. Then it looks back into the hall. It is grinning. I believe it is thinking this is going to be better than a Thanksgiving dinner you don't have to pay for. \nWEREWOLF Reeeal slow, Maa-aaarty- \nINT.  MARTY, CU \nHe's reaching desperately into the duct and staring at the approaching WEREWOLF. \nINT.  IN THE HEATING DUCT, ECU \nMARTY'S fingers brush the bullet once... again... seize it. \n", "test1_input": "NOTE: JANE is wearing a silver crucifix, and will continue to wear it through the whole movie. \nINT.  THE PODIUM  DAY \nTo one side is a big black-and-white photograph on an easel. It shows a van which has been customized into an emergency medical unit. \nBehind the podium are four chairs. REV. TOM O'BANION sits in one of them. ANDY FAIRTON sits in another, red-faced and beaming. JOE HALLER, the town constable, is just returning to his; LESTER LOWE is just approaching the mike as the applause dies. LOWE'S face shines with love and goodwill. \nLOWE For the last ten years... \nNo amplification. He taps the mike. \nINT.  JANE \nShe is making her way down the row to the aisle (the people should be seated in folding chairs). She passes a GIRL of about her own age who has overheard NAN'S parting shot. \nGIRL (mocking) \"Make sure your brother's all right.\" \nJANE (low) Marty's a booger. \nShe reaches the aisle and starts out. \nINT.  THE PODIUM, FEATURING FATHER LOWE \nHe taps the mike again. \nINT.  THE CROWD, FEATURING BOB AND NAN COSLAW \nBOB (good-natured) Just pretend you're in your own church askin' for money, father! It'll work fine! \nGood-natured laughter greets this. \nINT.  LOWE AT THE PODIUM \nA bit flustered, he taps the mike and is rewarded by a BRIEF SCREAM OF FEEDBACK. \nLOWE For the last ten years, I have had a dream. A dream of a time when modern medical care would come to this small community, which sometimes seems so far from Durham, with her lifesaving hospitals. I hope that this meeting, at which I see so many of my friends gathered, will be the start of making my dream come true. \nSOUND: Enthusiastic applause. \nEXT.  A SNAKE IN THE GRASS, CU \nIt's a blacksnake... harmless, but big. It goes wriggling through the grass toward a stream. In the b.g. - SOUND OF APPLAUSE. \nMARTY (voice) Holy...! Brady, are you sure they're not poisonous? \nBRADY (voice) Little old blacksnake? Hell, no! \nHands - the rather grimy hands of a boy bent on mischief - grab the blacksnake. \nEXT.  MARTY AND BRADY, CU \nBRADY holds the snake up. Both boys gaze at it with respectful wonder. \nNOTE: MARTY is wearing a silver St. Cristopher's medallion, and will through the whole movie. \nMARTY Lemme hold him! \nBRADY hands it over. As MARTY looks at the snake, BRADY sees: \nEXT.  JANE, COMING OUT OF THE TENT  DAY \nJANE (v-o) I was almost fifteen that summer. My brother Marty was eleven. Marty and his friend Brady Kincaid were the crosses I had to bear. Brady was actually the worse of the two, but I was rarely disposed to see that. Not when my younger brother was so constantly thrown in my face by my parents. \nLOWE (v-o from the tent) $32,000 is a lot of money. But when you think of the lives this unit might save, it seems very inexpensive indeed. \nApplause greets this. \nEXT.  MARTY AND BRADY \nAgain we are fairly tight on the boys - we see them from waist or chest height. BRADY snatches back the snake. \nBRADY I got an idea. \nMARTY What? \nBRADY looks toward JANE. MARTY follows his gaze. His eyes widen. \nMARTY You wouldn't. \nBRADY grins. MARTY assesses the grin. \nMARTY You would. \nINT.  THE PODIUM, WITH LOWE \nLOWE An endeavor like this seems to me to be the very definition of community - all of us pulling together as one, farmers and merchants... Protestants and Catholics... \nEXT.  JANE \nShe is walking slowly toward the picnic area, and is passing under a tree. There's more applause from the tent. \nBRADY (teasing voice) Jane... Jane... \nShe looks up. The blacksnake dangles down toward her, almost touching her upturned face. \nJANE shrieks and bolts. She gets a little way, trips over her own feet and falls down hard. She's wearing what was a nice jumper and nylons. Now the jumper is torn and the hose shredded at the knees. \n", "test1_true": "He's lying over a limb with the snake in his hand, laughing wildly. \nEXT.  JANE \nShe gets up, looks at her clothes, her bloody knees. She's near tears. \nEXT.  MARTY, AT ONE SIDE OF THE TREE, FAIRLY TIGHT \nThe shot's from the chest up. He looks sorry he was a part of this little stunt, as he ought to be. \nMARTY It was just a blacksnake, Jane- \nEXT.  JANE \nShe looks around at him in a fury of embarrassment and something very close to hate. \nJANE Look at my knees! Look at my dress! I hate you! \nEXT.  BRADY, UP IN THE TREE \nBRADY Did wittle Janie make wee-wee in her teddies? \nEXT.  MARTY \nMARTY Stop it, Brady. \nEXT.  BRADY, UP IN THE TREE \nHe throws the snake. \nEXT.  JANE \nShe dodges the snake with a little scream. She's beginning to cry, but she flips BRADY the bird just the same. \nEXT.  BRADY, IN THE TREE \nBRADY Ooooh, naughty! \nEXT.  MARTY \nHe moves toward JANE - there is something queerly unnatural in this movement, and in a moment we'll understand, but for the time being we must be puzzled. \nMARTY Jane, I'm sorry. It was just a joke. We didn't mean- \nHe's reached her. JANE is sobbing now, hysterical. \nJANE Oh, no! You never mean to! I hate you, you booger! \nShe runs away. \nEXT.  THE TREE, WITH BRADY \nHe swings down and comes over to MARTY. \nBRADY (with satisfaction) Really got her goat that time. \nEXT.  MARTY \nHe's in a wheelchair, looking glumly after JANE. \nMARTY Oh, shut up, Brady. You're warped. \nEXT.  NEAR THE BANDSTAND, FEATURING JANE  DAY \nShe's walking slowly along, still crying a little. Now she steps behind some bushes, looks around, hikes up the skirt of her jumper, and wriggles out of the wrecked panty hose. \nSTELLA RANDOLPH (voice) Wait! Don't go! \nStartled, JANE looks around, instinctively yanking her dress down. No one in sight. \nMAN (voice; rough) Just leave me alone! \nNow she looks toward: \nEXT.  THE BANDSTAND, JANE'S POV \nA man who looks like he might be a traveling salesman who has just stepped whole and breathing from a dirty joke about the farmer's daughter comes striding down from the bandstand. \nSTELLA RANDOLPH, a plump but sweetly pretty girl, comes to the stairs but does not descend them. She is also crying - but these are real tears, folks. STELLA is a human Niagara Falls. \nSTELLA (calls) Please! You have to help me! \nEXT.  THE GAY DECEIVER \nDECEIVER (keeps walking) It's your oven, but it ain't my bun you're baking in there. Sorry, babe. \nB.g. SOUNDS: More applause. \nEXT.  JANE \nWe can hear STELLA sobbing as JANE walks slowly toward the bandstand with her panty hose still balled up in one hand. JANE looks suddenly aware that she's not the only one in this sad world who has troubles. She reaches the foot of the stairs going up to the bandstand and tosses the hose absently in a litter can. \nJANE mounts the steps timidly. \nJANE Stella? Is that you? \n", "test1_id": 3057, "test2_input": "SOUND: A STEADY, LOW GROWLING, CLOSE. \nThey all stop, scared. \nBILLY McCLAREN Where's it coming from? Other side? \nBOBBY No- it's behind us. I told you you couldn't trust- \nASPINALL It isn't on either side. \nANDY What are you- \nASPINALL is looking around, his eyes widening with fear. \nASPINALL It's under the fog. It's right in with us. \nThe GROWLING STOPS. There's a beat of silence. Then: \nSOUND: SNARLING...AND A RIPPING CHOMP as dinner is served. \nSOUND: A SCREAM. \nEXT.  EDGAR ROUNDS, CLOSE \nHe's the one screaming, and if he reminds us of O'BANION, that's okay, because ROUNDS has also been caught in a trap. He tries to run, stumbles, falls into the ground fog. He goes on screaming. We can see his back for a moment, and then it disappears. \nSOUNDS OF CRUNCHING AND SCREAMING. \nROUNDS SHRIEKS. His hand and arm come up like the hand of a drowning man. Then it's gone. ROUNDS is gone. \nEXT.  THE SKIRMISH LINE \nThey stand there, chest deep in mist, a conspicuous hole in the ranks where EDGAR was. \nEXT.  BOBBY ROBERTSON, CU \nBOBBY (moaning) I can't move. Christ Jesus, I can't move! \nEXT.  THE SKIRMISH LINE IN THE RAVINE, A NEW ANGLE \nThe GROWLING STARTS AGAIN. THE CAMERA PANS SLOWLY UP THE LINE. The mist swirls, hiding whatever's beneath. \nEXT.  ASPINALL, CU \nASPINALL (low) I think we better start backing up, Andy. Real slow. Real- \nThe LOW GROWL rises to a snarl. And from below the mist, snarling and bestial but understandable, mocking ASPINALL'S voice: \nWEREWOLF (voice) \"Real slow! Real slow! Real slow!\" \nSOUND: CHOMP! \nASPINALL SHRIEKS and tries to run. He falls into the mist. There is another CHOMP. When he flounders up, half his face is gone. \nWEREWOLF (voice) \"Real slow! Real slow!\" \nA hairy arm rises from the mist and yanks ASPINALL down. \nEXT.  ANDY'S GROUP \nThey panic and break for it- MAGGIE, BILLY, and ANDY for one side, BOBBY and OWEN for the other. \nEXT.  OWEN, WEREWOLF'S POV \nTHE CAMERA IS RUSHING THROUGH THE GROUND MIST- this is like being in an airplane that's skimming the top of a cloud. \nWEREWOLF (voice; laughing) \"Real slow! Real slow! Real slow!\" \nEXT.  OWEN KNOPFLER \nHe's hit, as an unlucky swimmer might be hit by a shark. He whirls around, raising the peacemaker bat. \nOWEN Come on, then! You want to rock and roll with me? \nEXT.  THE GROUND MIST, OWEN'S POV \nFor a moment there's nothing- and then the werewolf rises out of it, eyes glaring green, muzzle and pelt slimed with gore. \nWEREWOLF \"REEEEEL SLOW!\" \nEXT.  MAGGIE AND ANDY \nMAGGIE (shrieking) Look at it! Holy God, Andy, look at that thing! \nANDY (groaning with fear) I don't want to look at it. \nHe runs, while MAGGIE stares, mesmerized, at: \nEXT.  OWEN AND THE WEREWOLF \nThe WEREWOLF closes in on OWEN, who belts it a good one with the peacemaker. The WEREWOLF swipes at him. OWEN ducks and slams it again. The WEREWOLF roars with anger. \nOWEN Come on, come on! You want to do the bop? I'll bop you, motherfucker! Come on! \nThe WEREWOLF dives under the ground mist. \nUncertain, OWEN begins to back up, holding the bat in his hands. OWEN is jerked down into the mist. He SCREAMS. The peacemaker rises out of the ground mist and comes down. Bonk! The WEREWOLF roars in pain. CHOMPING SOUND. OWEN shrieks. \n", "test2_true": "The peacemaker rises out of the mist again. The hands holding it are bloody. Blood runs down the bat. It descends. Bonk! The WEREWOLF roars again. There is a GURGLING SCREAM from OWEN... and then a curious SPLINTERING SOUND as the WEREWOLF sinks its fangs into the bat. \nEXT.  THE RAVINE \nTHE CAMERA MOVES ABOVE as the WEREWOLF moves below, escaping down the draw. \nPause. SOUND, IN THE B.G.- low but slowly getting louder: a congregation singing \"Bringing In the Sheaves\" to the accompaniment of a pipe organ. \nWEREWOLF (sing-songy voice) Bringing in the sheaves... bringing in the sheaves... we shall come rejoicing... bringing in the sheaves... \nTHE WEREWOLF FADES OUT; human voices singing the same hymn overwhelm it and we \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT.  HOLY FAMILY CATHOLIC CHURCH, PULPIT POV  MORNING \nIt's an almost exact reprise of #167. Most of the mourners are crying; MRS. BOWIE playing the organ; MARTY'S chair parked at the back. We can see UNCLE AL, MARTY, TAMMY, and MRS. STURMFULLER, exactly as they were at BRADY KINCAID'S funeral; in fact, this seems to be an instant reply of that event. One difference: we can't see BRADY'S coffin. It's below us. The hymn ends. \nINT.  FATHER LOWE, IN THE PULPIT \nLOWE Mr. and Mrs. Kincaid have asked that there be no mass said here this afternoon. They did ask me to say a word of comfort to you if I could. \nINT.  THE CONGREGATION, FEATURING HERB KINCAID \nHe sits in the first pew. In his grief he looks dead. \nHERB There is no comfort, Father. Only private justice. \nINT.  LOWE, AT THE PULPIT \nHe's thrown off his stride. Beginning to sweat. He's like an actor trying to remember his lines. \nLOWE Uh, if there's any word of comfort I can give you, it's just this: the face of the beast always becomes known; the time- \nHe looks down. His eyes widen in fear. \nINT.  THE COFFINS, LOWE'S POV \nYes, that's coffins- plural. Where BRADY'S coffin was formerly, there are now six coffins, smothered with flowers. \nINT.  LOWE, IN THE PULPIT \nHe is badly scared now; sweat is dripping off him. \nLOWE The time... the time of the beast always passes. There are answers... ways... ways to... to cope... if we turn to each other... \nHERB (bestial voice) Father- \nLOWE looks toward: \nINT.  FIRST ROW PEW, WITH HERB KINCAID, LOWE'S POV \nHe's looking down at something in his hands. Now he looks up and we see his face has become bestial. His eyes are green. As we look at him, the transformation cotinues. He's turning into a werewolf. \nHERB (snarling) It tore out his heart. \nAnd sure enough, HERB KINCAID holds BRADY'S dripping heart up in what were hands but which are now rapidly becoming paws. \nINT.  LESTER LOWE, AT THE PULPIT \nHe staggers back, in terror. \nLOWE (shrieks) No! \nINT.  THE CONGREGATION, LOWE'S POV \nMRS. BOWIE begins bringing in a few more sheaves on the church organ, and the congregation begins to sing. \nCONGREGATION Sowing in the morning/sowing seeds of kindness/sowing in the noontide/and the dewy eve... \nWe pan their faces, stopping on JOE HALLER. Now something is happening to JOE'S face. It is bulging, changing. He looks up from his hymnal and his eyes glare green. The pupils are split. He grins, showing big teeth. \nThey are all changing. Among the things we see are: \nPETE SYLVESTER, who is a church deacon, rushing down the aisle, changing, snarling. He grabs ANDY FAIRTON and the two of them grapple in the aisle. \nA YOUNG WOMAN with a baby in her arms turns back the blanket covering the baby's face and we see it's a wolfling; already the YOUNG WOMAN'S own hands are turning into claws. \nTAMMY STURMFULLER changing; PELTZER the druggist changing; the ZINNEMAN BROTHERS changing. \nAt the organ, MRS. BOWIE is now a werewolf clad in tatters of a silk bombazine dress; she/it is still wearing a veiled hat on her head, and she is beating the shit out of the organ keys with her clawed hands. She sounds like Jerry Lee Lewis after swallowing about a dozen bennies. And now the tune changes from the remnants of \"Bringing In The Sheaves.\" It changes into the Rheingold jingle. \nCONGREGATION (snarling chorus) My beer is Rheingold the dry beer... Think of Rheingold whenever you buy beer... \nINT.  LOWE \nFATHER LOWE goes stumbling backward, dropping his hymnal. The man is in an extremity of terror. \nREV. LOWE No! No! No! \nINT.  THE CONGREGATION, LOWE'S POV \nSome are tearing their hymnals apart and throwing them at each other. One guy- BILLY McCLAREN, maybe- wings one of them through a stained-glass window. Some of the werewolves- for they are all werewolves now- fight or make love in the aisles. The rest sway back and forth, grinning ferociously, singing. \nCONGREGATION (snarling it out) It's not bitter, not sweet, it's a real frosty treat... \n", "test2_id": 3058, "test3_input": "EXT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET \nCAMERA TRACKS HIM up the road. He goes slowly at first, but he lets it out a little after a while. He's really moving along- thirty, maybe forty miles an hour. The wind blows the hair off his forehead. He begins to grin. He's enjoying this. \nEXT.  UNCLE AL, WATCHING \nHe drinks some beer. He's grinning, happy for MARTY. \nEXT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET \nHe slows down, turns, stops. He revs the engine. VROOM! VRROOM! \nEXT.  THE SILVER BULLET'S MOTOR, CU \nA lot of changes back here. It looks almost like a motorcyle engine now. That chromed-silver carb predominates. \nSOUND: VAROOOOOOOM! \nEXT.  MARTY, CU \nGrinning. Looking at: \nEXT.  THE COSLAW HOUSE, MARTY'S POV \nIt's about a quarter of a mile away. \nEXT. MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET \nHe winds the engine up and pops the clutch. The Silver Bullet doesn't so much accelerate as blast off. It tilts back on its wheels. MARTY swivels into a position like that of an astronaut on lift-off. The Silver Bullet looks like a motorcycle popping a wheelie. MARTY has a great big grin on his face. \nEXT.  THE SILVER BULLET, MEDIUM-LONG \nRoaring down the highway at fifty or better, blue smoke jetting from the exhaust. MARTY is plastered back in the seat with the footrest pointing up at an angle. He's laughing like a lunatic. \nEXT.  UNCLE AL, PEEKING THROUGH HIS FINGERS \nUNCLE AL (to himself) The kid's dead meat. What have I done? (shouts) Put a rock in it, Marty! \nEXT.  MARTY IN THE BULLET \nHe uses the hand brakes. SOUND of braking and squealing rubber. \nEXT.  MARTY AND UNCLE AL \nThe Silver Bullet comes to a screeching, sluing stop near UNCLE AL. Blue smoke drifts up from the wheels. MARTY guns the engine once and then lets it idle. \nUNCLE AL You gave me a heart attack, Marty. I'm dying. I hope you're happy, because you are looking at a dying man. \nMARTY It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al. \nUNCLE AL It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir. \nMARTY I don't get you. \nUNCLE AL I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you? \nMARTY Sure. \nUNCLE AL Good. \nEXT.  THE NIGHT SKY, WITH THE MOON \nThe last bit of daylight is just filtering away. \nEXT.  THE COSLAW BACKYARD \nThe barbecue is over. BOB and JANE are putting lawn chairs on the back porch. MARTY, NAN, and UNCLE AL are all in the f.g. \nUNCLE AL I've got to go, Nan- I had a wonderful time. \nHe kisses her cheek affectionately, and she smiles at him. \nNAN So have I, actually... I wish it could always be like this. \nUNCLE AL See me around to my car, Marty, and make sure I stay out of trouble at least that long. \nMARTY Okay. \nHe and UNCLE AL go around to the driveway. NAN looks at them with troubled love. \nEXT.  THE COSLAW DRIVEWAY, WITH MARTY AND UNCLE AL \nUNCLE AL Now I said I had something for you, as I believe you will recall. \nMARTY Yeah! What is it? \nAL unlocks the trunk of his car and brings out a paper shopping bag. He places the bag in MARTY'S lap. MARTY opens the bag, but it's really too dark to see inside. He reaches in and brings out a handful of assorted fireworks- crackers, Roman candles, twizzers, smoke bombs, etc. \nAn expression of sublime delight fills MARTY'S face as he inventories these goodies. \nUNCLE AL You're gonna have the Fourth of July in October, Marty. Just don't blow your head off. (Pause) And remember that it isn't just the fireworks. It's because no crazy shithead should be able to stop the good guys, if you can dig that. \nMARTY (respectfully) I can dig it- thank you, Uncle Al! Thank you! \nUNCLE AL Stay near the house, for Christ's sake- someone's killing people. I have to be out of my mind to be doing this, you know. \nMARTY Yeah, I know. It's great! \n", "test3_true": "MARTY Yeah... sure. \nUNCLE AL Save this one for last. \nHe brings out a short rocket with stubby vanes on the end. A fat fuse sticks out behind the head. \nMARTY What is it? \nUNCLE AL A tracer. You'll like it. \nMARTY Thanks a million, Uncle Al! \nUNCLE AL You're welcome a million, Marty. Stick 'em in the bushes for now. \nMARTY motors over to the side of the garage, where there's a line of bushes, and conceals the bag in them. UNCLE AL gets in his car and starts it up. MARTY comes back. \nUNCLE AL (grinning) Have a good time, dear boy! And watch out for the werewolves! \nHe leaves. MARTY sits in his wheelchair, waving. \nEXT.  THE REAR OF THE COSLAW HOUSE  NIGHT \nThere's a downspout outside one of the upstairs windows. Now the window goes up and MARTY leans out. He grasps the downspout and begins working his way down. This should not be too hard for us to believe; we've already seen how strong MARTY'S arms are. \nHis legs dangle limply, but he's doing just fine. When he reaches the bottom of the drainpipe, they simply crumple under him and he uses his arms to pull himself over to the back porch. \nMARTY hoists himself over the porch rail. Here, under a tarp, is the Silver Bullet. MARTY pushes the tarp aside and gets in. He uses his hands on the wheels to get over the porch ramp and rolls silently down it. At the bottom he looks up at: \nEXT.  AN UPSTAIRS WINDOW, MARTY'S POV  NIGHT \nStill a light on up there. \nEXT.  MARTY, IN THE BULLET \nMARTY (whispers) Shit! \nThinks a bit, then starts to hand-roll the Bullet toward: \nEXT.  THE PATH BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND THE GARAGE \nMARTY comes slowly up the path. We hear soft grunts of exertion; he's still hand-turning the wheels for the sake of silence, and it's hard work. He stops at the line of bushes and gets the bag of fireworks. He puts it on his lap and starts moving again. \nEXT.  THE COSLAW DRIVEWAY, FROM THE ROAD \nThe driveway has a slight downslant, and MARTY coasts easily out to the road. He turns right and begins to roll slowly along the verge of the highway, still using his hands. We can see that the light is still on upstairs. MARTY turns back once to verify this himself, then keeps on going. He's not going to be deprived of his treat. \nEXT.  MARTY \nHe decides he's far enough away to be safe. He pushes the starter button. The engine cranks, coughs, and cranks some more. MARTY frowns, and pulls out a wire- a rudimentary choke, I suppose. He pushes the starter button again. It cranks, but doesn't start. \nMARTY pushes in the wire, looking concerned now, and tries again. This time, after the engine has cranked over a few times, it starts. \nMARTY (softly) All right! \nHe puts it in gear and starts off. \nEXT.  THE ROAD, WITH MARTY, EXTREMELY LONG \nWhat we see is a tiny boy in a tiny wheelchair moving along a dark, empty ribbon of road under a vast dome of stars. \nDISTANT SOUND: The Bullet's engine. \nEXT.  A ROADSIDE TURNOUT  NIGHT \nSOUND: Fast-rushing water. \nThe turnout is packed dirt. There's a grove of trees with picnic tables spotted among them at the back. The sign in the extreme f.g. reads ROADSIDE REST AREA at the top; AUGER FALLS in the middle; TOWNSHIP OF TARKER'S MILLS at the bottom. \nSOUND: The Silver Bullet approaching. \nMARTY turns in and rolls to the back of the rest area. He stops by one of the picnic tables and dumps the bag of fireworks out onto the picnic table and takes his time selecting the first- he's like a wine fancier with a whole cellar of rare bottles to choose from. At last he chooses a twizzer. He takes matches from the pocket of his pajama top and lights the fuse. \nWhen it starts to fizz, MARTY tosses it high into the air. \nMARTY (soft) Here's one for the good guys! \nEXT.  THE TWIZZER \nIt flies in an arc over the drop. \nEXT.  THE TWIZZER, FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE CUT \nTHE CAMERA TRACKS ITS FALL onto some rocks at the edge of the waterfall's catch pool. \nSOUND: Growling. \nEXT.  THE CREEK, WITH THE WEREWOLF \nIt has been drinking from the creek. It looks more than half human now- we would be able to recognize it for sure, but its face is in shadow. \nIt turns from the creek and gets up on its hind legs. \nEXT.  THE TWIZZER, ON THE ROCKS \nIt's guttering out. A hand-paw touches it and draws back quickly. \n", "test3_id": 3059}

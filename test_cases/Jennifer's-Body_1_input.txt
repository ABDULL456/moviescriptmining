INT. NEEDY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS Needy is preparing herself a fried bologna sandwich in the kitchen. Needy's ALBINO FERRET chases a ball across the cracked floor. Needy scrapes the sandwich out of the skillet and takes a bite.

CONTINUED: 
NEEDY Fried bologna is the bomb! (to ferret) You want some, Greedo? She tuns on the kitchen radio and is surprised to hear a very familiar song: "Through the Trees," by Soft Shoulder. Suddenly, she pauses, a look of UNEASE and even FEAR crossing her face. She stops and braces herself against the counter, her KNEES SHAKING. Something isn't right. She drops the sandwich. Greedo goes straight for it. NEEDY (CONT'D) Something's wrong... As Needy sinks to her knees, she stares straight ahead at the REFRIGERATOR. A photo magnet of JENNIFER leers back at her. 
She closes her eyes. A brief, near-subliminal FLASH of the carnage in the woods... 
The song ends, snapping Needy out of her reverie. RADIO DJ That was Soft Shoulder, the local band who became the unlikely heroes of the tragedy in Devil's Kettle last night. Eyewitnesses say the boys helped numerous people escape the inferno, risking their own lives in the process. That's rock n' roll with a conscience, ladies and gentlemen. Had a lot of requests for that one... 
EXT. KETTLE HIGH CAMPUS - SAME 
Mr. Wroblewski ventures into the woods, heading toward the clearing. At first, we can only hear mysterious sounds-- scratching and smacking. Birds and animals are closely gathered in a circle. 
Suddenly, Mr. Wroblewski clutches his arm and gags, realizing the animals are feeding on a huge CARCASS. A BADGER looks up, its snout soaked in blood. Mr. Wroblewski begins to scream. The animals scatter.

CONTINUED: 
A glimpse of the CORPSE: It's Jonas, of course. His entire torso has been torn open, exposing his ribs and guts. Blood and viscera everywhere, INTESTINES strewn about the forest floor like party streamers. MR. WROBLEWSKI Virgin Mother! 
Mr. Wroblewski falls to his knees, hollering. 
INT. NEEDY'S HOUSE (KITCHEN) - CONTINUOUS 
Needy is seated at the kitchen table. She accidentally drops the remains of her sandwich on the floor, where the ferret quickly pillages it. NEEDY Crap! Needy's mom, ANTONIA "TONI" LESNICKI, has quietly entered the kitchen in her pajamas. She's pale and sweaty, as if she's been spooked. 
TONI You said it. NEEDY Oh, hi, Mom. I didn't know you were awake. 
TONI I just had one of my night terrors. 
NEEDY It's four o' clock, so technically you had a day terror. TONI Right, right. I'm all mixed up since I started working swing again. NEEDY What did you dream about? TONI I dreamed some bad people were trying to nail me to a tree with hammers and big stakes and shit. Just like Jesus. She crosses herself piously. (CONTINUED)

RORY Hoo-whee! Smell's gettin' worse! 
NORTON (O.S.) Never mind, I said! Just keep going! 
RORY Smells pretty damn bad, Warden! In fact, it smells just like shit. 
His feet touch the ground -- or what he assumed was the ground. It's not. In fact, it's just what it smells like. He sinks in past his ankles. He slips and sits heavily in it. 
RORY Oh God, that's what it is, it's shit. oh my God it's shit. pull me out 'fore I blow my groceries, oh shit it's shit, oh my Gawwwwwwd! 
225	INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- DAY (1966) 225 
Red and others listen to violent barfing from below. 
RED (V.O.) And then came the unmistakable sound of Rory Tremont losing his last few meals. The whole cellblock heard it. I mean, it echoed. 
That's it for Red. He starts laughing. Laughing, hell, he's bellowing laughter, laughing so hard he has to hold himself, laughing so hard tears are pouring down his cheeks. The look of rage on Norton's face makes him laugh all the harder. 
226	INT -- SOLITARY WING -- NIGHT (1966) 226 
Abrupt silence. LOW ANGLE on steel door. 
RED (V.O.) I laughed myself right into solitary. Two week stretch. 
227	INT -- SOLITARY -- NIGHT (1966) 227 
RED It's shit, it's shit, oh my God it's shit... 
He starts laughing all over again, fit to split. 
RED (V.O.) Andy once talked about doing easy time in the hole. Now I knew what he meant. 
228	EXT -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- WIDE SHOT -- DAY (1966) 228 
Virgin landscape. Charming rural road. Suddenly, State Police cruisers rocket up the road with SIRENS AND LIGHTS. 
RED (V.O.) In 1966, Andy Dufresne escaped from Shawshank Prison. 
229	EXT -- FIELD -- DAY (1966) 229 
Shawshank is half a mile distant. WE TRACK ALONG a muddy creel as STATE TROOPERS and PRISON GUARDS scour the brush. A TROOPEE fishes a prison uniform out of the creek with a long stick. 
RED (V.O.) All they found of him was a muddy set of prison clothes, a bar of soap, and an old rock-hammer damn near worn down to the nub. 
TROOPER g2 pulls the rock-hammer from the weeds. SWISH PAN to a POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER. His FLASHBULB GLARE produces: 
230 	A BLACK AND WHITE STILL PHOTO 230 
of the hapless cops posing with Andy's reeking uniform and the worn rock-hammer. PUSH IN on the hammer. 
RED (V.O.) I remember thinking it would take a man six hundred years to tunnel through the wall with it. Andy did it in less than twenty. 
231	INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1949) 231 
Once again, we see Andy using the rock-hammer to scratch his 
name into the cement. Suddenly, a palm-sized chunk of cement pops free and hits the floor. He stares down at it. 
232	INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1949) 232 
Andy lies in the dark, studying the chunk of concrete in his hands. Considering the possibilities. Wrestling with hope. 
RED (V.O.) Andy loved geology. I imagine it appealed to his meticulous nature. An ice age here, a million years of mountain-building there, plates of bedrock grinding against each other over a span of millennia... 
233	INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1949) 233 
Andy stands peering at the small hole left by the fallen chunk. Carefully runs his fingertip over it. 
RED (V.O.) Geology is the study of pressure and time. That's all it takes, really. Pressure and time. 
234	INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1951) 234 
Rita is now on the wall, hanging down over Andy's back. 
RED (V.O.) That and a big damn poster. 
TRACK IN to reveal Andy scraping patiently at the concrete. 
RED (V.O.) Like I said. In prison, a man'll do most anything to keep his mind occupied. 
He hears FOOTSTEPS approaching. He smoothes the poster down and dives into bed. A GUARD strolls by a moment later, shining his flashlight into the cell. 
235	EXT -- PRISON YARD -- DAY (1953) 235

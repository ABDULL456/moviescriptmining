BABY JOKER Cheeco!  Cheeco!  Here, boy! 
No Cheeco.  He continues to a shed in the back yard.  He goes inside and picks up a chainsaw.  On his way out the shed, he's slapped in the face with a "Big Ass Stick."  Mr. Jones is working the handle. 
Baby Joker is out cold.  Mr. Jones stands over him. 
MR. JONES Nigga, you got knock the fuck out. 
CRAIG Yeah, pops! 
UNCLE ELROY Damn, big bro.  You swung that like Sammy Sosa. 
MR. JONES The skills are still intact.  Now tie his ass up, Elroy. 
He does. 
INT. JOKER'S HOUSE - DEN - CONTINUOUS 
The terror continues. 
JOKER My little brother went out to get my chainsaw.  I'mma show you what happens to fools who don't tell me what I wanna hear.  You ever see Scarface, mothafucka? 
Day-Day starts to cry.  Roach tries to scream through the tape.  Joker turns to Li'l Joker. 
JOKER (cont'd) Go see what's taking him so long. 
Li'l Joker obeys.  We FOLLOW Li'l Joker THROUGH the house and OUT the back door. 
EXT. JOKER'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS 
Li'l Joker stands at the back door. 
LI'L JOKER Junior?!  Junior?! 
No answer.  Suddenly he spots something over by the shed. It's Baby Joker all ties up. 
LI'L JOKER (cont'd) What the... 
He runs to the rescue.  But right before he gets to him, Uncle Elroy jumps out the bushes and takes him.  "Ronnie Lott Style."  Mr. Jones steps in with the stick.  Craig steps in with the rope, and it's over.  Uncle Elroy's hurt.  It's his back. 
UNCLE ELROY (in pain) My back. 
MR. JONES What's the matter? 
UNCLE ELROY I slip my disc, again... Oh got damn. 
Craig goes to assist Uncle Elroy. 
CRAIG Stretch it out. 
UNCLE ELROY Don't move me. 
INT. JOKER'S HOUSE - DEN - CONTINUOUS 
Joker is pissed. 
JOKER Where are these fucking guys? 
He storms out the room.  Day-Day and Roach try to escape. They flap around on the ground like a fish out of water. 
EXT. JOKER'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS 
The back door flies open.  Joker appears with the AK-47 in hand.  He spots Uncle Elroy in the middle of the yard bent over.  He lifts the AK. 
JOKER What you doing here? 
UNCLE ELROY I lost something, nigga.  What it look like? 
JOKER Looks like a dead man.

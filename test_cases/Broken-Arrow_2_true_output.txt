THE HUMVEES Come around a corner. The trail hugs the face of a ten-foot- high cliff. Suddenly, from off the cliff... 
HALE AND TERRY Jump down onto the roof of the lead Humvee. Hale looks at Terry, angry. But before he can say anything... 
IN THE HUMVEE Baker swerves, trying to throw them off. He pulls out a pistol, shoots up through the ceiling. 
HALE AND TERRY Bullets punch up. Hale pulls out the gun. It falls from his hand. Terry grabs it as a sharp swerve sends... 
HALE Flying. He lands hard behind the Humvee. 
IN THE SECOND HUMVEE Deakins points at Hale, getting to his feet. 
DEAKINS Run him down. 
HALE Sprints after the leading Humvee. Deakins' Humvee closes fast. 
TERRY Looks back, sees Hale's predicament. 
TERRY Here! She slides the pistol along the truck roof. 
HALE Grabs the gun out of the air as... 
BAKER Slams on the brakes. 
TERRY Comes flying off the top, landing on the hood, barely holding on. 
HALE Is going to be crushed between the Humvees. He jumps up, turning, as the bumpers come together. He lands on the tailgate facing backwards and fires into Deakins' windshield. 
DEAKINS AND KELLY Kelly ducks below the dash and slams on the brakes but Deakins doesn't flinch. The bullets bounce off the glass --bulletproof. 
IN THE LEAD HUMVEE Baker sticks his gun out the window and aims at Terry and starts to pull the trigger when he stops, feeling a gun against the back of his head. 
HALE Is behind him. Hale gets into the passenger seat. 
HALE Gimme the gun and get out. 
BAKER 
(SMIRKING) I don't know. I think we got ourselves a little stand-off. 
HALE No, we don't. Hale shoots Baker in the thigh. Baker howls. 
TERRY Reaches forward and grabs Baker's gun as... 
HALE Kicks Baker out of the Humvee. 
BAKER Bad timing for him. He tumbles out, right in front of... 
DEAKINS' HUMVEE And is run over. 
HALE Holds the steering wheel, yells to Terry. 
HALE You drive! 
TERRY Climbs into the Humvee, takes the wheel from Hale. She jams Baker's gun into her belt. 
HALE I'd yell at you for coming after me, but you did just save my life. 
There's a look between them, then Hale climbs into the back. He finds what he is looking for -- a jerry can of gasoline and an emergency tool box. 
IN THE SECOND HUMVEE 
DEAKINS What're you doing, Hale? 
IN HALE AND TERRY'S HUMVEE Hale keeps his back to the other Humves. He pulls gaffer's tape off a roll, tears it with his teeth, grabs...

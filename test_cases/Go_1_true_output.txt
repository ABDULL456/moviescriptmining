ON RONNA 
Whatever. 
Adam's friend ZACK is with him in line, YABBERING on a cellular phone. Ronna hits total. $25.12. Adam hands her a credit card. She swipes it through the machine and starts bagging their groceries. 
ADAM Does a British guy still work here? 
RONNA He went to Vegas for the weekend.

A glance between Adam and Zack, hard to read why. Zack nods for Adam to go ahead. 
ADAM Betcha wonder why we're buying all this orange juice. 
RONNA Scurvy? 
She's not going to rise to the bait. Zack looks over at Adam, then to Ronna. 
ZACK Say... (checks nametag) Ronna. You don't know where we could get something to go with this orange juice, do you? 
RONNA Doughnuts, aisle four. 
ZACK But then you get the weird taste in your mouth. I was thinking something a little more euphoric. The British guy usually hooks us up. 
She stops bagging. Looks at Adam. At Zack. 
RONNA How much? 
ZACK Twenty at twenty. 
RONNA You're overpaying. 
ZACK We're desperate. A bunch of us are going to this party tonight, this warehouse thing... 
He pulls out a postcard-sized invite. Bright colors, slick printing... 
RONNA Mary Xmas Supafest. 
ADAM You're going?

ZACK And we had planned this kinda pre-party. Only there's 20 of us, it's like all or nothing. 
Switterman walks down the end of the aisle, headed for the manager's desk. 
ZACK (low) A friend was supposed to get the stuff in Chicago, but now he's snowed in. So if you could help us out here... 
All three watch Switterman pass. It gives Ronna a beat to think. She hands Zack a post-it note and a pen.

RONNA Gimme a number. Let me see what I can do. 
ZACK Kick ass. 
Adam smiles. It's a nice smile. Even Ronna notices. 
RONNA So do you want the o.j. or not? 
ADAM Absolutely. 
11   INT. MANNIE'S CAR / PARKING LOT - NIGHT                                11 
The Beast is Mannie's pride and joy,    a late-70's Toyota held together with duct tape and prayer.     It's outfitted for the season with Christmas lights lining    the windshield and back window. Santa has replaced Jesus on     the dashboard. 
Ronna climbs in the passenger door, counting a stack of 20's fresh from the ATM. Claire's in back. 
CLAIRE You know that Simon's in Vegas. 
RONNA I don't need Simon. I'm going to Todd. 
MANNIE Todd GAINES? 
CLAIRE Who's Todd Gaines? 
MANNIE Simon's dealer. 
Claire sits forward in the seat, suddenly worried. 
CLAIRE You can't do that, can you? I mean, go around Simon. 
She looks at Mannie. He shrugs, unsure. 
RONNA Ok, listen up. If Simon were here -- which he's not -- he would charge fifteen, when I know he gets it for ten. (MORE)

MANNIE But it's like an evolutionary leap. You're moving up the drug food chain. Without permission.

CLAIRE Ronna, you shouldn't do this. 
Ronna pockets the cash. Mannie's about to say something when she stops him.

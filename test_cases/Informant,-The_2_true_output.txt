SHEPARD Hey, Mark you don't really need to narrate the tapes for us when you're making them. 
WHITACRE Right. Absolutely. Not a problem. 
HERNDON And you can talk less. 
WHITACRE I think I did on this one. Whitacre gives Herndon another tape and a small box. 
SHEPARD Don't force the conversation. 
WHITACRE But, they're good right? I mean, you guys wouldn't believe what goes on at these meetings. 
Draft: 1/15/03 52. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) I've got well over two million frequent flier miles.. .maybe more. The equivalent of two trips to the moon. I'm pretty much platinum across the board. Free upgrades... sometimes they'll move me from business to first just cuz the computer tells them I'm there... 
52 EXTERIOR RITZ HOTEL- PARIS, FRANCE- DAY Whitacre emerges from the hotel and gets in a cab. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) And you can redeem them for anything now...A Movado watch or a fly-fishing vacation in Montana... Whitacre tells the driver... 
WHITACRE American Embassy please. 
WHITACRE (V.O.) It's like 5000 miles every time I go to Zurich, Paris, Munich...1 don't even know how many miles are in the Delta account...I just give Ginger the statements... I'm probably one of the youngest guys ever to go over a million miles...I get a letter from the CEO every year thanking me...it's a form letter, but it looks like he's really signing it...They probably walk in one day and he signs like a hundred while he's on the phone... Whitacre gets out of the car and walks into the embassy. Shepard meets him an ushers him into a room where a phone is hooked up to a recorder. 
SHEPARD You should probably use your ADM credit card... Whitacre dials the phone. 
WHITACRE Sure, great. You make it some place good for dinner last night? 
Draft: 1/15/03 53. 
SHEPARD I just ate in the hotel... 
WHITACRE The hotel...What'd you have? The call rings through. 
WHITACRE Hey, it's Mark Whitacre calling from Paris for Mick Andreas...Hey, it's Mark. I just got out of the lysine meeting... It went great...I think we can keep it at around a buck and a quarter no problem... Andunder... Shepard sneezes. 
WHITACRE'S POV He follows Shepard's hands from Kleenex, to coffee cup, to pen, to a tug on his ear... 
WHITACRE (V.0.) Now what happens? Something you breathe in on an airplane. Some little bacteria and now it's on his hands, the cup, the phone... Probably got it from his kids and now I'll spend the weekend with it in bed...And I'll miss a few days next week, or Alexander'11 run a fever and who pays for that? Where does the FBI weigh in on that- - as a cooperating witness-- what does it say about exposure to airborne contaminants...I3 ADM compensated for me missing work? 
53 INTERIOR O'HARE AIRPORT- DAY Whitacre walks down the concourse carrying a BLACK FOLDER with ADM emblazoned on it. He turns into the bathroom and stares at himself in the mirror. He checks his HAIR and then opens the FOLDER. He removes the legal pad to reveal a secret compartment holding a small TAPE RECORDER. 
WHITACRE (into tape recorder) This is tape seven, side two.. .Chicago, O'hare airport... He looks at himself in the mirror. And then down at his feet. A BLACK CHUCKLE'S CANDY lies on the floor swarmed by ants. 
Draft: 1/15/03 54. 
WHITACRE POV The black chuckle being carted away by ants inches from his wing tips. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) That's a big break, right there-- definitely. There's no choices to be made. No debate. It's there-- you're an ant-- you eat it-- you bring it back for the other ants.. .They don't say they'd rather have the cherry flavored one... Real- simple to live like that. 
54 INTERIOR GASLIGHT LOUNGE, O'HARE AIRPORT 54 Wilson sits at a table with two FRENCH EXECUTIVES-- ROLLIER AND CROUY. Wilson wields the FOUNTAIN PEN. The lounge did well in the 70's and has decided to stay there-- most everything is covered in red velvet, except for the waitresses-- they're covered in sequined body suits and fishnets. Whitacre returns from the bathroom. He puts the TAPE RECORDER/FOLDER on the table. Wilson rests his cocktail ON 
IT. 
WILSON We cannot have one section of the world where it works and the rest of the world where it doesn't. It will not last... 
WHITACRE (V.O.) Debate and discussion. They just keep the black one from making it home... 
ROLLIER We would obviously play the game. But, the Koreans and the Japanese... 
CROUY .They'll cheat. 
TERRY WILSON It'll never work then. A TRAY OF DRINKS attached to a WALKING CENTERFOLD goes by. Wilson leers... 
Draft: 1/15/03 55. 
TERRY WILSON (CONT'D) WHITACRE (V.0.) Look, everyone has to share Terry doesn't like me very numbers. It's so goddamn much ...He's got blotchy simple. How the hell else skin... What causes that would you do it? blotchiness?? It must mean It's what we do in the citric something medical... He'll acid business and look at the have a stroke and someone price of vitamins. will say-- `he was blotchy... it happens.' 
CROUY Let's not forget that if prices went up in Europe it's because we talked in Mexico first. 
TERRY WILSON That's right, you made it happen. 
55 INTERIOR HAMPTON INN DECATUR- EVENING 55 Shepherd has headphones on-- he's excited by what he hears. Whitacre excitedly diagrams the world's Lysine market on a dry erase board for Herndon illustrating the relationships-- a primer in corporate greed. 
SHEPARD (loud because of the 
HEADPHONES) Mark, these are just the kind of tapes we need. 
TERRY WILSON (O.S.) (over the headphones) It didn't just go up like that-- you made it happen. 
WHITACRE And we're getting our marching orders from Andreas-it goes all the way up.

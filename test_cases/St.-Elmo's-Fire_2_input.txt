WOMAN Jus' give me my check. Wendy hands her the check. 
WOMAN You get some hot clothes, get yourself a man... you won't be worryin' about all this shit. She leaves as Billy arrives in time to check her out. 
BILLY Welfare recipients are getting better-looking these days. 
WENDY Ever feel like you're not accomplishing anything? Billy sits on her desk. 
BILLY I think I'm in touch with the feeling. Let's go get a drink. 
WEND Y Billy, why aren't you at work? Billy gives her a look she knows all too well.

WEND-Y Do you have any interest in the janitorial field? They both smile. 
WENDY You should be playing your music. Billy...

Â¢ ALEC You're not the fraternity star anymore. No more Billy the Kid. Billy starts to leave. Alec follows. 
ALEC I didn't bargain for you turning out this way. 
BILLY And I didn't bargain for you turning into a pompous politico. Suckin' up to Hodges. That's it, Al, isn't it?... You've become a Republican!!! 
ALEC And you've become a drunk. 
BILLY Oh, no, not just 'a' drunk, Big Al. One of the great drunks! Born, bred and diseased in the s 
U.S.A.

BILLY Oh, I forgot, Kev. You don't do anything Alec doesn't tell you to do. Well, that's-okay, 'cause just remember one thing. You can pick your friends and you can pick your nose, but you can't pick your friend's nose. Billy leaves. Wendy looks at Alec and starts to laugh. 
ALEC Stay right here, Wendy. She can't and runs after Billy.

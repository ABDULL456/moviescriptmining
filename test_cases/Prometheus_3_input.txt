A CLATTER behind her makes her spin: but it's only a spherical mapping probe, bumbling through the dark. 
She walks on - 
HOLLOWAY (O.S.) (FILTERED) Jocelyn! 
The voice transfixes her where she stands, a look of holy dread on her face. Shivering, she prowls toward the sound. 
XENOMORPH INCUBATOR 
Watts enters a new chamber, looking around in astonishment. The domed ceiling is honeycombed with cells like a beehive. Grotesque molluscoid organisms are secreted in them - their vile orifices cinched tightly shut. 
Watts stumbles on something: looking down, she sees a helmet. Picks it up. The stenciled label reads HOLLOWAY. The clear visor has been melted through by a powerful acid. 
She looks up: a tracheal airshaft curves up into the dark. 
An electric CRACKLE. A flare of blue light makes Watts leap back against the wall. 
Holloway falls out of overhead shaft and crashes to the floor. He lies in pain, barely conscious. Blue and luminous, a holographic ghost. 
Watts stares, paralyzed. The ghost gasps out a word: 
HOLLOWAY Jocelyn! 
Holloway's headlamp shines on the molluscoid right overhead: the beam awakens the organism. Its sphincter mouth dilates. 
A soft white octopoid FACEHUGGER descends on a quivering rope of mucus. Sprawls slitheringly over his clear visor. 
Acid HISSES. Smoke rises from the glass. 
The vision vanishes in a sizzle of static. Watts huddles against the wall, gasping. 
In the beam of her flashlight, the FACEHUGGER lies dead, legs curled in. 
She looks up. Sees the open molluscoid above where Holloway lay. The other molluscoids not yet opened in their cells. 
Terror. She steals out of the chamber. 
LOWER CORRIDOR 
Watts emerges into a hallway. Leans against the wall, wide- eyed. Panting with the horror of what she's seen. 
She glances left and right. Jumpy now. 
All is silent. She lifts the map unit. A trace leads off into the dark. If Holloway's course before was direct and clear, now it is a meandering thread. A drunkard's walk. 
INT. MAGELLAN - CORRIDOR 
Janek pulls his communicator from his belt as he strides along. Punches a control. 
His voice reverberates over the ship's public address system. 
JANEK All hands, duty stations. Ready for flight. The Magellan is lifting. 
Vickers pursues him down the corridor, shouting. 
VICKERS Captain. Captain! 
BRIDGE 
Janek strides onto the Bridge, Vickers a terrier on his heels. But something in the faces of his men stops him cold. 
Glasse and Brick look stricken. 
JANEK What is it? 
GLASSE Nav computer's not responding. "Access denied." 
In disbelief, Janek strides to his Captain's chair. Taps controls. What he sees takes the wind out of him. He stares at Vickers in outrage and violation. 
JANEK What have you done to my ship? 
Vickers is legitimately shocked. She shakes her head. 
VICKERS Nothing. What's wrong? 
INT. CATACOMBS - UNDERGROUND HANGAR 
A circular chamber of stunning size - a thousand feet across. Its lofty ceiling flat and segmented, designed to open. Watts follows her map into the space in awe. 
Dominating the hangar is a ship: the vast horseshoe-shaped vessel familiar from the original film. We will come to know it as the JUGGERNAUT. It's at rest on its landing gear. Skeletal gangways slanting up to its three massive doors. 
Watts glances at her map: Holloway's holographic trace leads right up the gangway into the ship. She goes. 
PILOT CHAMBER 
Watts passes through a circular space with a high domed ceiling. A green glow emanates from grooves in the floor. 
In the center of the chamber: a PILOT'S CHAIR. 
A mechanical throne built to giant scale. Its seat segmented like an armadillo's back. Tubes and conduits poised and waiting for some connection. The chair is empty. 
Above the chair, a massive telescope-like apparatus juts into the air, its function unknowable. 
NAVIGATION CHAMBER

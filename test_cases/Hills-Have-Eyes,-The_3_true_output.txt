Inside the trailer- The first aid kit is open on the table. Even with a blanket around his shoulders, Bobby shivers. Ethel soaks cotton in alcohol using it to clean his wounds. 
ETHEL You're lucky Brenda found you. Imagine if you had to spend the whole night out there in the cold. Bobby winces from the pain. 
BRENDA Don't worry, Beauty will come back when she's hungry... Bobby doesn't answer. He keeps the truth to himself, not wanting to worry his family. 
BOBBY Have you tried the radio? 
ETHEL It doesn't work... 
LYNN We heard something. Some sort of breathing... Bobby lifts his head. 
BOBBY What do you mean? 
(CONTINUED) 
55 CONTINUED: 55 
LYNN It was really weird, right mom? 
ETHEL (minimizing the incident) I'm sure it was just static. 
LYNN Mom, it sounded like a perverted crank call. 
BRENDA 
(JOKING) Only Mom would get an obscene phone call out here! Suddenly,a muted sound echoes outside. Bobby jumps up, grabs the gun and crouches behind the door. 
BOBBY (to the others) Ssshhhh... His mother and two sisters are surprised by his agitated behavior. 
BRENDA What's wrong with you? Footsteps. Someone approaches. 
BOBBY (stern but soft) I want you guys to stay in here. Brenda?! You hear me? Gun in hand, he opens the door- Bobby is about to shoot when a figure emerges from the dark. IT'S DOUG, holding as much as he could carry from the car graveyard. 
DOUG What the fuck are you doing? Don't point that thing at me. Bobby lowers the weapon. 
BOBBY I didn't know it was you. 
(CONTINUED) 
55 CONTINUED: (2) 55 
DOUG Who else would it be?! Bobby is interrupted by Brenda who sees Doug from the window. 
BRENDA Doug's back! 
DOUG Hey girls! Quickly, Lynn exits the trailer and jumps into her husband's arms. They kiss. Doug sets down all of his findings. 
DOUG (CONT'D) Look what I found. Various tools, a fishing pole... 
DOUG (CONT'D) With all of this, we can find a way to fix the car, right Bobby? Bobby doesn't answer. 
DOUG (CONT'D) I found this really huge crater at the end of the road! I've never seen anything like it! People must use it as a dump site. It was full of all this garbage... (pointing to the fishing 
POLE) Look at this, it's brand new! 
LYNN What are you going to do with a fishing pole in the desert? You didn't you find anybody?

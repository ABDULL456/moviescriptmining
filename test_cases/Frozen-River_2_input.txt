Ray rolls down the window and tosses out their shoes and socks. 
RAY You're welcome. 
Ray swerves back out onto Route 37. 
52   EXT. ROUTE 37 INDIAN RESERVATION - SAME                    52 
They continue down the road to the reservation line. After they pass the sign: YOU ARE ENTERING THE LAND OF THE MOHAWK, Ray pulls over and stops. 
Ray takes the money and consolidates it into one paper bag. 
LILA What about mine? 
RAY We're even now. 
They stare at each other for a second or two, but Ray does not take out the gun. Lila reaches for the door handle 
Lila gets out. Ray drives away.

The kitchen clock reads 3:55. 
A RENTAWORLD truck is parked outside. Two large RENTAWORLD MEN sit in it. T.J. sees them from inside the trailer. He comes outside. 
He walks up to the trunk. One of the men rolls down the window. 
T.J. My mom told me to give you her credit card number. 
RENTACENTER MAN (weary) We only take cash or money orders. 
T.J. Well, my Mom might be late. 
RENTACENTER MAN She's got three minutes. 
T.J. goes back inside.

Ricky is glued to a cartoon. T.J. watches him, checking out the window every few seconds for Ray. 
A long moment passes with only the sounds from the cartoon. 
55   EXT. RAY'S TRAILER YARD - DAY                              55 
The RENTAWORLD men get out of the car and start toward the trailer. 
From down the road the Acclaim comes roaring along, kicking up dust. 
Ray swerves in and jumps out and runs up to the men. 
RAY It's okay. I got it right here. (she waves a wad of fifties and twenties). Two fifty five, right? 
The men nod, relieved. Ray counts out the money. 
Ricky bursts out the door and runs towards Ray. 
RICKY Mommy! 
She catches him in her arms and hugs him. T.J. stands at the trailer door, watching as the men drive away. 
RAY (to Ricky) Who wants to go the Price Chopper and get some Cap'n Crunch? 
RICKY I DO! 
RAY Wanna to go to the Price Chopper? 
T.J. walks out, looking at the money suspiciously. 
T.J. Where'd you get that? 
RAY (a beat) Matt made me an assistant manager. 
T.J. No way. 
RAY Is that so hard to believe? 
T.J. It's been like two years. 
RAY Exactly, and that's why he gave me a bonus. 
He isn't convinced. 
RAY (CONT'D) Do you wanna go to the Price Chopper or not? 
T.J. gets in the car.

REESE Maybe.  With these weapons... I don't know. 
CUT TO: 
129     EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT                               129 
Reese's car turns into the parking lot of a large hospital, acres of pavement dotted with sporadic parked cars. 
CUT TO: 
130     EXT./INT. TERMINATOR'S CRUISER - NIGHT                 130 
ANGLE THROUGH WINDSHIELD, ON TERMINATOR, as he searches. Streetlights flare across rhythmically. 
CUT TO: 
131     EXT. POLICE HELICOPTER - NIGHT                         131 
It moves between two buildings, searchlight sweeping back and forth.  DOWN ANGLE, past the chopper, as the circle of light moves across a row of parked cars. It passes a grey sedan with a shattered windshield. Flicks back.  Holds. 
TIGHTER ON CAR, GROUND LEVEL, in the glare and propwash. It looks empty. 
CUT TO: 
132     EXT. PARKING LOT/NEARBY  - NIGHT                       132 
LOW ANGLE DOLLY, MOVING WITH REESE AND SARAH as they crawl behind a row of parked cars. 
He has firm hold of her arm but she seems to be cooperating. In the B.G., the chopper hovers, on the far side of the lot. Reese approaches the door of a late model brown Buick which has been left with its window partway down. He unlocks it and they slip inside. 
CUT TO: 
133     EXT./INT. TERMINATOR'S CRUISER - NIGHT                 133 
TIGHT ON TERMINATOR, through the windshield of the black- and-white. 
DISPATCHER (V.O.) (filtered) Suspect vehicle located at parking lot, Cedar and Glen- haven... 
FULL SHOT as Terminator's cruiser slews in a radical turn and roars off in the opposite direction. 
CUT TO: 
134     INT./EXT. BROWN BUICK/PARKING LOT - NIGHT              134 
Reese uses the butt of the shotgun to smash loose the ignition assembly.  He begins working on the wires.  A police cruiser appears, moving slowly between the rows of cars. 
Reese grabs Sarah and pulls her down to huddle below dash level.  A moment later a spotlight flashes across the seats above them.  They hear the helicopter circling closer. 
SARAH Reese...why me?  Why does it want me? 
They are lying very close, a forced intimacy.  Reese's voice is an urgent whisper, almost in her ear.  A cruiser passes so close they can hear its radio clearly. 
REESE There's so much... 
SARAH Tell me.  Just start at the beginning. 
Reese musters his thoughts.  And starts. 
REESE There was a war.  A few years from now.  Nuclear war.  The whole thing.  All this-- 
His gesture includes the car, the city, the world. 
REESE (continuing) --everythingis gone.  Just gone.  There were survivors. Here.  There.  Nobody knew who started it. (pause) It was the machines. 
SARAH I don't understand... 
REESE Defense network computer. New. Powerful.  Hooked into everything. Trusted to run it all.  They say it got smart...a new order of intelli- gence.  Then it saw all people as a threat, not just the ones on the other side.  Decided out fate in a microsecond...extermination. 
Reese pauses, and when he continues it's less like a military briefing, quieter. 
REESE (continuing) Didn't see the war.  I was born after, in the ruins.  Grew up there.  Starving.  Hiding from the H-K's. 
SARAH The what? 
REESE Hunter Killers.  Patrol machines. Build in automated factories. Most of us were rounded up, put in camps...for orderly disposal. 
He pushes up the sleeve of his jacket and shows her a ten digit number etches on the skin of his forearm. Beneath the numbers is a pattern of lines like the auto- matic-pricing marks on product packages. 
REESE (continuing) Burned in by laser scan. (pause) Some of us were kept alive... to work.  Loading bodies.  The disposal units ran night and day. We were that close to going out forever... 
The helicopter moves overhead.  Its searchlight illum- inates the car interior, moves on.  Before the rotor sound fads, Reese starts the car. 
CUT TO: 
135     EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT                               135 
Several black-and-whites are moving among the parked cars, slowly. 
ANGLE ON TERMINATOR'S CRUISER rolling along just above idle.  He peers into the row of cars, listening and seeing on level we can't. 
CUT TO: 
136     INT. BROWN BUICK - NIGHT                               136 
Reese is holding onto Sarah's shoulder tightly.

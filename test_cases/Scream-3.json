Why the hostility? \nMILTON Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions. \nGALE (shit-eating smile on her face) They're the ones who approved it. \nMilton storms off camera, Buddy following close behind.

Says you called Sarah and told her to come down to the studio.  Roommate answered the phone, says it was you. \nROMAN Wait a minute!  I never called her! I never told her to go   anywhere! \nDETECTIVE KINCAID Roommate says she knows your voice, Mr. Bridger. \nROMAN Well, she wasn't speaking with me!  Look, I did not call   Sarah Darling! \nDETECTIVE KINCAID Sarah Darling said you did. \nROMAN Someone is trying to ruin my movie.

Too late, studio's shutting down production. Called my film a risk! Do you believe this shit? They're actually shelving my film because there's been one ensie little murder.

Look, let's get something straight Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME.

New York for a month? L.A Forever? \nGALE It was fucking '60 Minutes II'!  I couldn't say no!  I could've been the next Diane Sawyer! \nDEWEY What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers?

A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked. \nGALE Someone stole Sid's file? \nDEWEY I already removed it.  I think someone on the film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only reason I came here.

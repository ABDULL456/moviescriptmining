{"train": "Scream 3 - early draft \nEHREN KRUGER \n2nd DRAFT - REVISED \nMAY 2, 1999 \nFADE IN: \nA big dramatic crescendo as we -- \nOPEN ON: \nEXT.  HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - SUNSET - AERIAL \nFriday night traffic as usual. Things appear to be backed up all the way to the valley. A cacophony of car horns rise up on the soundtrack as we slowly DISSOLVE INTO: \nINT.  FORD EXPLORER - NIGHT \nA new 99' Explorer sits in the midst of the gridlock. Behind the wheel is hot teen heartthrob and Hollywood everybody BEN DAMON. Ben is handsome, studly, in his early 20s. However, aside from being just another pretty face in the city of angels he's also a cocky, arrogant prick. Ben's in the middle of a heated argument on his cell with his Agent, Cathy. \nBEN (into cell) God dammit Cathy I have no time for this crap! I'm supposed to be at the premiere of STAB 2 right Now, arm and arm with my girlfriend cause she's got a bit part in that over advertised piece of shit and I'm just going to humor her. You mena to tell me that in all your squandering the best you can do for me is A bit role in STAB 3: RETURN TO WOODSBORO?! Come on! It's just another cheap slasher flick! How dare you offer me such a role! I've done Shakespeare! I've worked with directors like DePalma and Scorcesse and you offer me this crap?! It's insulting. I should fire you and go to ICM. \nCATHY(O.S.) (off phone) Ben, I will not sit around and listen to you bad mouth me! Without me you would've never gotten as famous as you are today. The least you can do is show me a little god damn respect. \nBEN (into phone) You want Respect, Cathy? Here's your respect. FUCK YOU! You're fired. (Ben hangs up) Unfucking believable. \nBen socks the steering wheel out of frustration. The horn blares uncomfortably. \nBEN Stab 3: Return To Woodsboro. Pah. What's next, Friday The 13TH PART 15: JASON DOES BROADWAY? \nBen's phone rings. He answers it. BEN (into phone) What's up, B.D. with the B.D. \nWOMAN'S VOICE (off phone) Hardly as large as I'd like it to be. \nBEN Christine? \nCHRISTINE(O.S.) No, Jennifer Love Hewitt. Of course it's me, silly. And I feel like an ass standing in this theater lobby all by myself. Where are you babe, the movie starts in twenty minutes. \nBEN Look, I'm stuck on the freeway. I think there was some big accident. It could be a little while so I don't want you to start freaking if I don't get there at exactly, (checks watch) Eight thirty. \nCHRISTINE(O.S.) All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut. \nBEN (putting up faux-enthusiasm) Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world. I bet you did such a great job. \nCHRISTINE(O.S.) I did. Hon, although I got a total of six minutes screen time, they're the best six minutes of the movie. \nBEN Heh heh I bet they are babe. I bet they are. Look, my battery's dying . . . But of course, we notice Ben's battery is fine, he's just trying to cut the conversation short. \nCHRISTINE(O.S.) Alright Hon, talk to you when the lights go down. \nBen smiles. \nBEN Sure thing. \nBen hangs up. He reclines back in his seat. Camera slowly pans out the windshield revealing the huge traffic pile up awaiting him. He's not going anywhere. \nCLOSE ON GLOVE COMPARTMENT. \nVOICE You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies. Here's how we play. I ask you a question. You get it right, your girlfriend lives. You answer wrong, she dies. \nBEN I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you! \nVOICE Maybe so, but right now, we play the game. First question, Your girlfriend's counting on you, Name your girlfriend's character in STAB 2? \nBen groans. He bangs his head against the steering wheel, if only  he'd have paid attention to Christine he might have known this. \nVOICE Come on. Don't you know? \nBEN (hesitating) It's CICI! Cici's the name of the character she plays in the movie! \nVOICE Very good. Now we play ROUND 2. \nBEN What?! But I did everything you said to do! \nVOICE That's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're taking the game to a whole new level.  Meet me beneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes. I'll have your girlfriend. We'll be waiting. \nBEN What?! \nVOICE Good bye Ben. Click. The killer hangs up. Ben flips open the phone, dials 911. Ringing and then . . . \nRECORDED MESSAGE (off phone) Due to the high volume of calls this evening, Dispatch is temporarily shut down. If this is not a real emergency please call another dep- \nBen hangs up, dials CHRISTINE's number. RINGING, then-- \nVOICE You're not playing by the rules Ben. Don't you want her to live? \nBEN I swear to God if you lay one hand on her! \nVOICE No! You listen to me, if you're not where I want you in fifteen minutes I'll hollow her out. Do you understand? \nIN THE B.G. we hear CHRISTINE's horrific screaming. \nThe killer hangs up. Ben looks ahead, traffic is picking up. He puts the SUV into gear, peels out the nearest opening, narrowly avoiding collision. His car screeches down the off ramp. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT \nBen comes screeching around the corner in his FORD EXPLORER.  Tires smoking. Sparks flying. The HOLLYWOOD sign stands like an impending pall in the awaiting b.g. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  HOLLYWOOD SIGN - NIGHT \nThe SUV comes to a screeching halt alongside the hilly, narrow road. Ben jumps out of his car, cell phone in hand. He looks up at the towering sign standing ahead of him, contemplates. Does he really wanna go up there? He looks into his SUV, gets an idea. \nTHE BACK -- \n--is opened. Ben reaches in looking for a weapon. AN OLD BEACH CHAIR. Not gonna do the trick. A pair of old shoes. Nope. Then he finds it, a LOUISVILLE SLUGGER with \"ACTORS AT BAT FOR BRAIN CANCER\" written across it. \nBEN (to himself) Thank God I decided to do some community service. \nBen takes the bat, closes up the back of the SUV. He begins to walk towards the sign when suddenly -- \nHIS CELL RINGS. \nBen answers the call. \nRoman smiles. The true costumed horror film buffs in the audience break into applause. Gale, somewhat distracted, other what not caring what this second rate director has to say, gazes at a costumed individual at the far corner of the set, watching from a half-open exit door. Now it could be just her imagination running away with her and her atmosphere but it almost appears as if the figure is pantomiming slitting his throat with a gleaming blade. \nA LOUD BUZZING O.S.  Gale is startled out of her skin. She looks up at a sign hanging over the stage. THE WORD \"COMMERCIAL BREAK\" is illuminated in flashing red light. Gale sighs, looks back to the exit. The GHOST is gone. She turns to Roman. \nGALE Would you excuse me for a moment? \nROMAN (smiling) Sure. \nGale bolts for -- \nINT.  BACKSTAGE - TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT SET - DAY \nGale races around the corner of the set, smashing right into - \nDETECTIVE MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D. Mid-thirties. Handsome with piercing eyes. He grabs Gale by her shoulders, shepherding her aside. \nGALE Jesus Christ you scared the shit out of me. DETECTIVE KINCAID I'm sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me to introduce myself, MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D. (flashes badge) Are you familiar with the actor Ben Damon, or the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS? \nGALE Well I interviewed Damon once for the show. He was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the second one, Christine Perkins, she had a part in Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI. \nDETECTIVE KINCAID Both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films. \nGALE So is that why you're here? Is that why you're holding me from my show, to tell me about some brutal homicide I'm not even involved in? \nDETECTIVE KINCAID I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but there's more. The killer left a note. \nGALE A note? \nDetective Kincaid reaches into his back pocket, pulls up a newspaper clipping in a ziplock evidence bag. He holds the bag up For Gale to see. \nEXTREMELY CLOSE on the ARTICLE . . . \"MAUREEN PRESCOTT, MOTHER AND WIFE, FOUND BRUTALLY RAPED AND MURDERED IN BEDROOM\". A b/w photo of Sidney's mother Maureen stands hauntingly before the camera. \nGALE(O.S.) That's Sidney Prescott's mother. \nDETECTIVE KINCAID(O.S.) There's more. \nKincaid flips the article over. Someone has scrawled in black marker across the back \"SIDNEY\". \nDETECTIVE KINCAID I've tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott, but she's keeping herself very well hidden. You're my one and only hope in finding her. Her life may be in grave danger. \nGALE I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, (gale hesitates), not going to talk. \nDETECTIVE KINCAID And who would that be? \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  SUNRISE STUDIOS BACK LOT - DAY \nA red BMW convertible speeds through the back lot. Behind the wheel is DEWEY RIELLY. Former Police Officer, turned Technical advisor on the red hot set of . . . STAB 3: RETURN TO WOODSBORO. \nAll around the lot are promotional banners and posters for the film. Dewey parks his car outside a soundstage, exits. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  STAB 3 SET - DAY \nA huge replication of Woodsboro in a building about the size of an airplane hanger.  In one corner we've got the Macher and Prescott homes. In another corner stands the infamous Becker house where the nightmare all began. In other regions are sights like the Town Square and Market, an exterior for the Woodsboro Police Station,  A TOP STORY news van, etc. \nDEWEY, Enters set, bumping into his movie alter-ego -- \nTotally repulsed, Angelina gets up, races off set. \nTOM Talk about moody. \nTom leans back seductively, his crotch in full view, staring at Sarah with bedroom eyes. \nTOM And how about you good looking? Got any plans for later? \nSARAH Eww yeah, finding a guy to have sex with that doesn't look like you. \nSarah, following suit laid by Angelina, scampers off set. Tom looks up at Tyson, smoke blowing out his nostrils. \nTYSON Oh no. I ain't into that shit. \nTyson races off set. Tom laughs, covers his face. \nCUT TO: \nDETECTIVE KINCAID AND GALE. \nThey walk through the set. Gale's mesmerized. Kincaid is all business. \nGALE D\u00e9jr vu-do. \nThe pair come to a halt on the driveway of what is supposed to be the Macher Residence. Everything from the smashed beer bottles in the garage, to the boat on the driveway is mimicked to a perfect t. Even a foam dummy Of TATUM RIELLY dangles from the doggy door, head squashed a bloody mess. \nGALE stares at the swaying dummy, haunted. \nVOICE(O.S.) Well well, someone dies and Gale Weathers comes running. What a shock. \nGALE looks up. DEWEY stands beside her. \nDETECTIVE KINCAID Mr. Rielly? My name is Mark Kincaid. I'm with the L.A.P.D. Are you aware\tof last night's Events? \nDEWEY Yeah. A real tragedy. \nDewey stares daggers through Gale. There is a real bitter coldness between the two. \nGALE Dewey, personal lives and pasts aside, this is about Sidney. We need to know where she is. \nDEWEY What so you can just exploit her again with another book? Sid doesn't need you Gale. \nGALE (to Kincaid) Show him. \nDETECTIVE KINCAID Mr. Rielly, this was found alongside the bodies of Ben and his girlfriend. \nKincaid hands Dewey the ziplocked clipping. Dewey examines it, his fear slowly growing. \nDEWEY I promised Sid I'd keep her in seclusion. I promised her nobody would ever find her. If you don't mind Detective, I'd like to approach her with this on my own and see what she'd like to do about it. \nKincaid nods. \nDETECTIVE KINCAID That's fine Mr. Rielly, but if anyone else should die, I'm going to have to get a warrant. \nDEWEY Understood. (a beat) If you'll excuse me Detective. (coldly) Gale. \nDewey walks off camera. Kincaid puts his hand on Gale's shoulder. \nDETECTIVE KINCAID I'm going to have a little chat with the producers. Don't wander off. I may need you. \nBefore Kincaid can finish, Gale buts in. \nGALE Excuse me Detective, I think we have some business to attend to. \nMILTON (flabbergasted) GALE WEATHERS?! What are you doing here? No press on the set! (to security) No press, no press on set! Get that woman out of here. \nSECURITY GAURD (approaching) Yes, Mr. Milton. DETECTIVE KINCAID No, Mr. Milton, Miss Weathers is with me. \nMilton nods his head, flags down the guard. He walks away. \nMILTON Well then, I guess I'll be leaving then. \nGALE Oh come on! Why the hostility? \nMILTON Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions. \nGALE (shit-eating smile on her face) They're the ones who approved it. \nMilton storms off camera, Buddy following close behind. Gale looks up at Kincaid. \nGALE Alright Kincaid, no where to? \nDETECTIVE KINCAID I go to the police station and do my job, and you go back to being Gale Weathers. \nGALE Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around. \nDETECTIVE KINCAID Look, Miss Weathers, if there's a problem, give me a call. Here's my card. I'm always there. \nKincaid hands Gale his card, begins to walk out of the building. \nGALE Shit. Can I even get a ride home? \nCUT TO: \nINT.  SIDNEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nSIDNEY PRESCOTT, the stoic, survivor. Now 24, she lies peacefully in bed, her black lab PETE curled up in a ball at her feet. A noise startles the animal awake. It sets off the bed barking hysterically at -- \nTHE BEDROOM WINDOW \nSIDNEY -- \n--awakens. She squints her eyes to try and make out what her dog is going into conniptions over. Then she sees, and her face loses any trace of color. \nMAUREEN PRESCOTT'S GHOSTLY WRAITH is pressed up against the window. She's wearing a tattered, blood soaked night shift.  Her voice is muted but her lips are moving as if trying torelay a message to Sidney. Sid's hysterical crying. She slidesoff her bed, makes her way towards the window when suddenly -- \nMAUREEN slides down the glass, as if being pulled by somethingbeneath the window sill. Something we don't see . . . yet. \nSIDNEY (crying) Mom! \nLeft behind in her wake are five bloody streaks running downthe glass. The streaks begin to bleed, as if each wounds themselves. They bleed right through the glass. Sidneyreaches out to touch them when suddenly -- \nTHE GHOST springs up behind the window, shatters the glass panewith his fist. SIDNEY screams -- \nAWAKENING IN BED FROM HER NIGHTMARE. \nHer dog's barking wildly. \nTHE WINDOW is fine. \nON THE TV -- \nA REPORTER stands with the HOLLYWOOD SIGN in the b.g. \nREPORTER The mutilated bodies were discovered late last night by the L.A.P.D, prominent actor Ben Damon was slated for a role in the upcoming STAB 3: RETURN TO WOODSBORO -- \nSidney shuts off the TV as a familiar voice cuts through the din: \nVOICE Do you think it's over Sidney? Do you? \nSIDNEY W-what do you want? \nVOICE I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game. \nSIDNEY You sick fuck I'm tracing this call as we speak! The police are gonna nail your ass! \nVOICE (laughs coldly) Let them try. You'll never find me. I've already gotten away with murder before. For instance, Maureen Prescott. \nSIDNEY (tears welling) No. You didn't kill my mother. Billy Loomis and Stu Macher did. \nVOICE Heh. So you think Sidney. So you think. It's all been building up to this Sid. Every STAB. Every SCREAM. Every ounce of blood that's been spilled has all been leading up to this moment. WELCOME TOTHE FINAL ACT. \nSIDNEY The final act? Well let's play asshole! \nVOICE No. We play in my court this time. Come to Hollywood. STAB 3's going to cutting corners cast-wise.  And I've got my eyes set on a technical advisor named Dewey Rielly. \nThe killer laughs coldly. Sidney wanes. \nSIDNEY (crying) If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you! \nVOICE Great. A spirited one. I'll be seeing you real soon Sidney. Real soon. \nClick. The killer hangs up. Sid's left trembling. She rips the headset out of the phone, reaches into her desk for a loaded.38 special.  She stands up, and peers out her office window. \nSIDNEY'S P.O.V. - THE DARK, OMINOUS NIGHT. \nCUT TO: EXT.  SUNRISE STUDIOS - NIGHT \nSarah Darling drives through the main gates in her porshe, rounds a corner. \nEXT.  STAB 3 PRODUCTION OFFICES - NIGHT \nSarah parks outside the production offices, gets out of her car. \nKILLER'S P.O.V - watching from the rooftop, Sarah approaching the dimly lit offices. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  STAB 3 PRODUCTION OFFICES - NIGHT \nSarah steps into the office. It's desolate. Silent. All over the place are promotional items (standees, posters, banners) for STABS 1-3. Sarah passes a big cardboard GHOST. \nSARAH STAB 3. Oh God I've gotta get myself a better agent. \nSarah walks down a hallway. \nSARAH (calling out) Anybody home? \nSarah passes Roman Bridger's office. It's half-open. \nSARAH Who's this? \nROMAN Who's this? \nSARAH This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have to start the scene in the shower!  The whole shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering? \nROMAN Why don't we just read the scene?  Candy, is that like candy cane or candy apple? \nSARAH Whatever.  Come on, who is this?  I think you have the wrong number. \nROMAN But you know my favorite name? \nSARAH I'm hanging up right now. \nROMAN It's Sarah. \nSARAH Roman that's not the line. \nROMAN It is in my script. \nSARAH Has there been another goddamn rewrite? How  the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes? \nROMAN It's not just a new script, it's a new movie. \nSARAH What?  What movie? \nROMAN My movie. \nA pause, then a familiar dark natured noise enters our ears, the killer's sinister voice. \nVOICE It's called, Sarah gets sliced like a fucking pig. Still in character, Sarah? \nSarah tosses down the phone, bolts out of the office. \nINT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT \nSarah stops in her tracks. Through the smoked glass of the front door she sees a shape approaching. She screams, spins around, runs for the prop room. \nINT.  PROP ROOM - NIGHT \nSarah locks the door, backs up right into -- \nAN ARMY OF GHOSTS! \nAT LEAST THIRTY GHOST COSTUMES dangle from hooks on costume racks. Sarah catches her breath, dives into one of the racks.  She pulls up her cell phone, starts to dial. \nINT.  STAB 3 - PRODUCTION OFFICES - NIGHT \nA SECURITY GUARD opens the front door, pokes his head into the offices. \nSECURITY GUARD Mr. Bridger? \nNo answer. The guard nods, backs out of the offices, locking them with SARAH and the killer inside! \nCUT TO: \nINT.  PROP ROOM - NIGHT \nSarah's waiting on eggs as a digitized pre-programmed commissarymenu for Sunrise Studios drags out. \nDETECTIVE KINCAID I'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers. You're no longer working with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why you're standing in here right now. By all means I should have you thrown out. \nGALE But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help. \nDETECTIVE KINCAID In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers. \nGALE Please, call me Gale. \nDETECTIVE KINCAID Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok? \nGale smiles. DETECTIVE TOM WALLACE, Kincaid's cohort and partner. He's in his late thirties. Family man. Wallaceenters frame with a folder in his hands. \nDETECTIVE WALLACE Mark, Bridger's in custody. We traced his phone records. He's the last person to speak to Sarah Darling before she died. Or at least call her home. \nGALE Wait a minute, Roman's your suspect? \nDETECTIVE WALLACE Listen, Diane Sawyer, this here is classified information. Why don't you go investigate the bad meat at the A.P. This is police work, not Pulitzer material. \nGALE Hey, fuck off. \nDETECTIVE KINCAID No, cool it Wallace. She's working with me. \nDETECTIVE WALLACE (cocky) Well then. Looks like I'll go dust for finger prints with Barbara Walters. \nWallace arrogantly walks off camera. Gale looks at Kincaid. \nGALE So, what now? \nCUT TO: \nINT.  INTEROGATION ROOM - POLICE STATION - NIGHT \nA frazzled Roman is seated at a long conference table while Wallace and Kincaid grill him with questions. \nDETECTIVE KINCAID Mr. Bridger, you didn't tell us you spoke with Sarah Darling before she died. \nROMAN That's because I didn't. \nDETECTIVE WALLACE The guard said she was there for a meeting with you. \nROMAN What meeting? \nDETECTIVE WALLACE We talked to her roommate, too.  Says you called Sarah and told her to come down to the studio.  Roommate answered the phone, says it was you. \nROMAN Wait a minute!  I never called her! I never told her to go   anywhere! \nDETECTIVE KINCAID Roommate says she knows your voice, Mr. Bridger. \nROMAN Well, she wasn't speaking with me!  Look, I did not call   Sarah Darling! \nDETECTIVE KINCAID Sarah Darling said you did. \nROMAN Someone is trying to ruin my movie. Someone wants to kill   my movie! \nDETECTIVE WALLACE Hey, look at it this way, if anything this'll be something interesting to put on the director's commentary for when the film hits DVD. \nROMAN (dry laugh) Ha! Too late, studio's shutting down production. Called my film a risk! Do you believe this shit? They're actually shelving my film because there's been one ensie little murder. God, three people died during the filming of The Exorcist. \nDETECTIVE KINCAID Well I doubt they were stabbed to death and I strongly doubt the killer of them left messages on the scene for the police to find. \nGALE Right. Sorry. (a beat) Do you think he did it? (RE: ROMAN) \nDEWEY (his beeper goes off) I've got my suspicions but still, nothing  you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person. \nGALE And who is that? \nBut Dewey doesn't answer. Again, he's staring daggers through Gale.  Years and years of bottled up resentment is finally surfacing. \nDEWEY Jennifer needs me. \nGALE Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to? \nDEWEY I'm on duty. \nDewey races out the room. Gale pauses, stares at the interrogation. Wallace has reduced Roman to tears. It's pathetic. Gale bolts after Dewey. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  SAN FERNANDO VALLEY - NIGHT \nThe wind rushes past the camera. A huge panoramic view of L.A.  FULL MOON hangs in the sky. A coyote howls in the near distance. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  JENNIFER'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nA nice low ranch tucked away in the valley. Dewey rolls up Jennifer's driveway in his truck. Gale follows behind in her VW JETTA. \nDEWEY (noticing Gale) Stop following me. \nGALE I happen to work for the police god dammit! \nDEWEY You're not a detective. \nGALE Neither are you, Magnum P.I. \nDEWEY Gale, your engine's still running. \nGALE Fuck! \nDewey shakes his head in disgust, disappears into the house. Gale runs back to shut off her car. From out of the bushes lunges -- \nTOM PRINZE, loaded off his ass, still holding a half-filled bottle of JOHNNY WALKER BLACK LABEL SCOTCH in his hand. \nTOM Gale Weathers. What a surprise. \nGALE Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker. \nTOM Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket. \nGALE Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya. Stage the news to boost ratings. \nTOM Really, cause that stunt lost me the lead role in Roman Polanski's latest picture. Huh, what a coincide I was picked up by Roman Bridger. Well, not exactly the Roman I wanted. Get my point? STAB 3 is bullshit. Fuck, because of your big mouth I'm here, drinking piss water SCOTCH with Second rate fucking celebrities like Jennifer Jollie and yourself! (a beat, subtle) Hey, I just got an idea. Maybe I should Have a look at your break line. That your car over there? \nGale pushes Tom's chest. Stopping him. \nGALE I think we should go inside. I have to have a talk with the cast. ALL OF YOU. \nTOM (laughs) You mean what's left of us. (tosses empty bottle aside) Yeah I'm running on empty anyways. Gotta refuel. \nTom stops in his tracks. He looks down. Lying in a pool of blood at his feet is ANGELINA TYLER! Tom screams, staggers backwards right into the arms of -- \nTHE GHOST -- \nTOM You fucker! \nThe GHOST slashes open Tom's arm. Tom screams, backs up into the kitchen. The ghost grabs him by the throat, begins choking him mid-air. He slowly begins to lift him off his feet, angling the knife, readying to make the kill blow. Tom gags. He can't even scream, the killer's crushing his voice-box, causing a trickle of blood down his lips. \nTOM (gagging) Fucker! \nTHE GHOST brings the knife down, piercing Tom's heart, pinning him to the closet. Tom kicks around for a moment before finally going limp. The GHOST steps back, admiring his work. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  JENNIFER'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nJennifer, Gale, and Dewey are pacing around nervously. \nJENNIFER Shit! Where the hell are Tom and Angelina? \nGALE I don't know. Screw them. Look, what's important is that we stick together. No matter what. If anyone is next it's you or me Jen. \nDEWEY What about Sidney? \nJENNIFER What about her? \nSuddenly, a knock at the door. The three are startled. Dewey looks at the front door. \nDEWEY Ssh. Maybe it's Tom or Angelina. I'll get it. \nJENNIFER What if it's the killer? \nGALE Oh use your brain drama queen! Do the killers ever knock on the fucking door? Ever see Jason do that before burying an axe in some big titted blonde's head? Or maybe Michael or Chucky? Huh? \nJennifer sticks her tongue out at Gale. Dewey reaches into a holster tucked away under his jacket, drawing up his 9mm. \nDEWEY Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything. \nGALE Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door! \nDewey nods his head, slowly makes his way towards the door. Gale and Jennifer huddle together, follow close behind. \nJENNIFER Do you smell something? \nDEWEY (smirking) It's Gale. She farts when she gets nervous. \nGale makes an angry face, slaps Dewey upside the back of his headplay fully. Dewey steps up to the front door. IT'S NOT LOCKED.  He reaches for the knob, turns it when suddenly -- \nTHE POWER SIZZLES OUT! \nEVERYONE SCREAMS! \nDEWEY Alright don't panic! Just a fuse. \nDewey throws open the door. ANGELINA'S CORPSE drops into the doorway. A SYMPHONY OF SCREAMS. \nDEWEY Hurry! Everyone out the back way! Now! \nDewey, Gale, and Jennifer race for the French doors in the living room leading outside to the pool and backyard. A PHONE RINGS somewhere in the house. \nDEWEY OH SHIT! RUN! \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  BACKYARD - JENNIFER'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nJennifer, Gale, and Dewey take off out the patio doors when suddenly KA-BOOM! THE WINDOWS BLOW OUT! THE ROOF SPLINTERS. \nA HUGE CONFLAGRATION! The three dive into the swimming pool as debris rains down onto the Earth. \nTHE GHOST -- \nWATCHES FROM THE SHADOWS, FLAMES BOUNCING OFF HIS PALLID WHITE MASK. \nSIRENS ARE HEARD IN THE NEAR DISTANCE. \nAS THE GHOST RUNS OFF INTO THE NIGHT, HE DROPS ANOTHER NEWSPAPER CLIPPING ON THE GROUND. IT BLOWS IN THE WIND. \nCUT TO: \nTHE NEWSPAPER CLIPPING - ECU \nIT'S FLIPPED OVER BY A PAIR OF HANDS.  SCRAWLED ON BACK IS:\"I KILLED HER\" WE ARE: \nINT.  DETECTIVE KINCAID'S OFFICE - DAY \nDETECTIVE KINCAID paces around his room. A battered and bruised Dewey and Gale sit beside his desk in Police Uniforms (since their old clothes has obviously been drenched). \nDETECTIVE KINCAID Whoever it is, now is taking credit for Maureen Prescott's murder. \nGALE But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it! \nDETECTIVE KINCAID Yeah, but, if I'm not mistaken, you said in your book that Sidney got it wrong before. She accused Cotton Weary of murdering her mother, and he was sent away for it!  Maybe there is a third killer.  Sidney Might know something \nKincaid's eyes appear as if questioning Dewey. \nDEWEY I told you, I don't know where Sidney is. And even if there was a third killer, Sidney doesn't know about it. \nDETECTIVE KINCAID That is for me to decide.  I need to talk to her Mr. Riley, she is a key element in this case.  I have a press conference in an hour, and I need to explain why there are four dead celebrities. \nGALE Four? There are five. \nDETECTIVE KINCAID Ben Damon. Christine Perkins. Sarah Darling. Tom Prinze. That's four, last time I learned how to count. \nDEWEY What about Angelina Tyler? She was there too. \nDETECTIVE KINCAID Police are still searching through the debris. Could be days before we find her . . . that is, if she's even there. \nKincaid seems to be getting a morbid charge out of all of this. He smirks ever so nefariously at Dewey. \nGALE OK, look.  We all know that this has something to do with 'Stab 3'.  What we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving articles about Maureen Prescott. \nDETECTIVE KINCAID Actually, there was more this time. This time, we found a picture too. \nDEWEY/GALE (together) What? \nKincaid holds up a second ziplocked evidence bag. Within is a blurry 5x4 of MAUREEN PRESCOTT exiting a motel room with COTTON WEARY. Kincaid turns it over. Also, written on it's back is 'I KILLED HER' \nDETECTIVE KINCAID Before you jump to conclusions, the man in the picture, COTTON WEARY, is out of the country on business. His alibi checks out. Seems he's got a TV show in Australia, 100% COTTON. It's supposedly the biggest thing down under since Yahoo Serious, but that's besides the point. \nGALE Thank you. \nDEWEY Sid, this is detective Kincaid. \nDETECTIVE KINCAID Nice to finally meet you, Sidney. \nDEWEY The killer called her. \nDETECTIVE KINCAID What?  When? \nGALE What'd he say? \nSIDNEY Oh, you know, the usual small talk, \"What's new, how ya been, how do you want to die?\" \nDEWEY Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've gotten your number? \nDETECTIVE KINCAID He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set? \nDEWEY No. \nGALE Do you have her number stored in your memory? (Dewey thinks) Phone memory! \nDEWEY Oh.  Yeah, I guess I do. \nGALE Has anyone else every used your phone? \nDEWEY Just Jennifer. (To Kincaid_) And you. \nDETECTIVE KINCAID Hey, I'm the cop here.  You're in my office, Riley. \nSidney notices the clippings and the photograph of Maureen. \nDETECTIVE KINCAID The killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each murder, Sidney. Recently he's also left a photo of your mother. \nSIDNEY Why didn't you tell me?  This is my mother, Dewey. Why didn't you say something? \nDEWEY I was afraid they were bait, something to, ya know,  trick you out of hiding. \nSIDNEY Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio where all this shit's going down. \nDETECTIVE KINCAID Are you sure? \nSIDNEY Absolutely. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  SUNRISE STUDIOS BACK LOT - DAY \nKincaid and Dewey's cars drive through the lot. They drive over towards a row of trailers, park. \nKINCAID disappears to do something else while GALE, DEWEY, and Sidney get out of Dewey's truck. \nDEWEY Alright Sid, over there is the STAB 3 Production offices. That's where Sarah Darling was murdered last night. \nSIDNEY Mm, what a waste of Silicone. (a beat) What does my mother have to do with this all Dewey? We're a long way from Woodsboro. \nA figure lunges out of nowhere, startling all three of them. It's a young, scrawny goth girl in  heavy make-up. \nThis is KAREN COLCHECK, 22. She holds something in her hand, a video tape marked SCARY MOVIES 101. \nGale takes the folder from Bianca, opens it up. Inside are 8x10 headshots of MAUREEN PRESCOTT when she was younger. Behind the pictures is a Xeroxed listing of the films she's starred in. \nGALE What are these movies? 'Amazombies', 'Space Psychos' 'Creatures from theSan Andreas Fault'? \nBIANCA Horror flicks. B-Movies from Milton's heyday. \nGALE/JENNIFER (together) What? \nBIANCA You know, JOHN MILTON, the horror producer? Those were some of his early flicks. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SOUNDSTAGE - SUNRISE STUDIOS - DAY \nSidney stands beside Dewey and Detective Wallace. \nSIDNEY Listen Dewey I have to go to the bathroom. \nDEWEY Do you want me to come with you Sid? I mean, remember what Randy said? \nSIDNEY No I'll be ok. I've got my mace. My knife. (smiles, raises up her fists) These two lethal weapons. \nDETECTIVE WALLACE Sure you don't need a police escort? That's what we're here for. \nSIDNEY No really, I'll be fine. \nDewey and Wallace nod. Sid begins to walk towards the soundstage. \nSIDNEY I'll be right back. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  LADIES ROOM - SOUNDSTAGE BUILDING - DAY \nSidney stands at the sink washing her face. She shuts off the water reaches for a paper towel when suddenly, something catches her ear. Almost as if a man's whisperedher name 'Siiiiiddney'. Sid turns around, stares at the empty bathroom. \nSIDNEY H-hello? Anyone there? \nSilence. Sid reaches into her pocket book, draws out a Gravity Knife. She flips open the blade, crouches down on her knees, scanning the row of stalls for feet. What a relief . . . none. Sid smiles, dismisses what she thought she heard when she sees -- \nTHE RUMBLING AIR CONDITIONING UNIT. \nSidney goes back to drying her face when suddenly -- \nMAN(O.S.) (whisper) Sidney. \nThis time it's apparent. There's somebody else in the bathroom. Sid begins to make her way towards the bathroom door when suddenly -- \nWHAM! A STALL door flies open. THE GHOST charging out at full-force. Sid hits the deck, sliding across the floor, deflecting the blow from the knife as the killer buries it into the sink counter. Sid races for the door, killer hot on her trail. SUDDENLY -- \nWHAM! The storage closet door flies open and a second GHOST comes charging out, knife gleaming. He dives for Sid. Sid takes up her knife, buries it in her attacker's shoulder. The GHOST goes reeling back into the closet. Sidney slams the door closed on him. She dives for the door knob when suddenly, the first ghost comes running back at her. She ducks as he swings his knife, burying it into the bathroom door. Sid bolts across the bathroom towards a tiny window in the far corner of the ceiling. Using the trash as a booster, she leaps up, slides open the window, and dives out, just as the deadly pair of attackers come back for more. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  STUDIO LOT - DAY \nSidney comes charging around the corner of the soundstage building. She looks up, realizing she's just ran herself into a dead end. \nSIDNEY (crying) Shit. \nDEWEY/JENNIFER (together) Agreed. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  JOHN MILTON'S OFFICE - DAY \nMilton's on the phone with Roman. \nMILTON (into phone) Roman I know you're upset. But there will be other movies. I know. Ah, VARIETY called you a Pariah? Well fuck them. I got a great script on my desk. It's called TRAGIC MENAGE TRIOS and it was written by John Sayles. I'm thinking you for Director. What? (knock at the door) Come in. (into phone) No, not to you Roman. Look I'll talk to you later. Bye. \nMilton hangs up as Gale, Jennifer, and Dewey barge intohis office. \nDEWEY So you knew Sidney Prescott's mother. \nMILTON Just what the hell do you people think you're doing, barging in here like this? I've got important calls to make. I run this studio. \nGALE Answer the question. You knew Sidney's mom? \nMILTON Who? \nJENNIFER Rina Reynolds. \nMILTON Do you know how many actors have worked for me? Hundreds, thousands. \nGALE Nobody said she was an actor. \nJENNIFER Good twist. \nMILTON What's your point? \nDEWEY No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call. \nMILTON I remember her!  She was a bit player in a couple of my movies. A nobody! So what does it matter? \nJENNIFER Oh, Come on!  You have made millions off the story of her murder.  You're obsessed with HER and you're obsessed with her DAUGHTER! \nGALE Settle down Beavis. (to Milton) Why don't you tell us the truth? \nMILTON What the hell are you guys getting at?  I make horror films, that's what I do.  The Studio came to me with 'Stab'.  They came to me, check it out. \nDEWEY But you know who she was. \nMILTON When we did the first 'Stab\" I realized I'd known Maureen Prescott before, I mean as Rina. I couldn't tell anyone.  Can you imagine the press? \nGALE And now? I mean, murders on your set and still you say nothing? \nMILTON Get real, that would make me a suspect! \nGALE Just because you knew her? \nMILTON Yeah. \nGALE I don't think so!  Just what happened to Maureen when she was in Hollywood? \nMILTON Now you listen to me, Lois Lane, let it go. It's dead and buried. Daddy took ol' Yeller out behind the barn and shot him in the head a long time ago. \nGALE Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over National TV? Why don't you start talking. \nMILTON It was in the 70's, everything was different. I was well known for my parties, Rina knew what they were. It was for girls like her to meet men, men who could get them parts, if they made the right impression.  Nothing happened to her that she didn't invite, in one way or another, no matter what she said afterwards. \nSIDNEY Hey Detective?  What's your favorite scary movie? \nDetective Kincaid pauses, he leans over Sidney's chair, his penetrating eyes glaring right into hers. \nDETECTIVE KINCAID (sotto) My life. \nKincaid exits, door slamming shut behind him. A beat, then -- \nSIDNEY Mine too. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  RECEPTION AREA - MILTON'S OFFICE - SUNSET \nMilton steps out of his office into his reception area.  Secretary's gone for the night. Milton starts out of the office, disappears. \nCLOSE ON A COAT CLOSET. \nThe door creaks open. Gale, Jennifer, and Dewey emerge from the darkness. Jennifer is gagging. \nJENNIFER Oh God Gale, Dewey was right. Stop getting so nervous and you might stop causing me to gag! \nDEWEY/GALE (together) SHUT UP! \nJennifer's quiet. \nJENNIFER I think Milton's the killer. I think he just went out to kill another cast member. \nGALE Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends. \nJENNIFER Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino? \nGALE (smacks her forehead out of frustration) Do you get any of my witty humor? I mean, you did play me for three movies. (a beat) His two hands, dingus. \nDEWEY Ssh ladies. \nDewey leans into Milton's office door, slowly opens it. Darkness spills out. The three disappear inside it. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  HALLWAY - BUILDING - NIGHT \nMilton's walking down the hallway. It's dark. Desolate. CAMERA tracks along the paisley velvet carpet as a phone rings O.S. \nIT'S MILTON'S CELL. He answers it, pushes the elevator 'up' button anxiously. \nMILTON (into phone) John Milton. \nVOICE Wanna play a game? \nMILTON Who is this? \nVOICE You tell me. You bankrolled three  movies about me. \nMILTON It's you. The saboteur whose been fucking up my movie! (a beat) I swear to God if you don't stop I'll find you and have you killed! I shut down production on that piece of shit STAB 3! We had a no talent director and the lousiest Sidney Prescott on the planet but that was besides the point! You still killed MY movie! A John Milton film! And if you ever try and cross me again you'll be sorry. My next movie is gonna be a grandiose step up from this slasher shit! It's a film written and directed by John Sayles. \nMilton's going rapid fire. \nVOICE Oh poor John. There's not gonna be another film. Well, at least not for you. \nGALE (screaming) Dewey! \nCLANG! The Killer's blade glistens in the moonlight. He charges for Gale. Gale screams, races out of the office door, slamming it closed on the killer sending him flying onto his back. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  HALLWAY - OFFICES - NIGHT \nGale races down the hallway, frantically trying every door she passes. All of them locked. She reaches the elevator, hits the \"down\" button.  The door opens with a ping. Gale unleashes a horrendous scream -- \nMILTON -- \n--has been strung up from the ceiling ventilation duct, gutted from knob to gullet. His entrails lie in steaming heaps at his feet. \nGALE staggers away from the elevator, speechless. She screams again. \nHER GHOSTLY ATTACKER is coming straight for her. \nGALE fakes out the killer, dives into the elevator. He runs ahead, briefly, giving Gale enough time to trip him sending him landing flat on his face. Gale races out of the elevator doubles back down the hallway towards a door marked \"stairs\". She bolts through the door. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  STAIRWELL - OFFICES - NIGHT \nGale races down the stairs, nearly tripping and falling. She races out onto the ground floor. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  SUNRISE STUDIO LOT - NIGHT \nGale races out of the office building. A car horn blares. She screams. \nKINCAID jams on his breaks, gets out his car. He draws up his gun. \nDETECTIVE KINCAID Jesus Gale what happened? \nGALE (frantic) He killed Milton! The killer's  inside there! Oh God! (realizing) DEWEY! Dewey's in there too! He needs medical help! He's hurt! \nDETECTIVE KINCAID Alright, calm down. I'm going to radio in for backup right now. \nVOICE(O.S.) Not so fast. We're not finished. \nKincaid spins around. Gale screams. The GHOST comes charging out of nowhere, slashes open Kincaid's throat, stabs him in the chest. Kincaid drops onto the hood of his car, dead. \nGALE pauses. She's screaming hysterically. The killer raises the knife menacingly. \nVOICE I wouldn't run if I were you Gale. It's only gonna end up with you getting Skewered like a fucking pig. I need you. \nGALE (nervously) Awfully late time to be doing an interview. \nVOICE I need you as bait. For Sidney. \nGale closes her eyes, cries as the killer stalks towards her. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  DETECTIVE KINCAID'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nSidney sits in Kincaid's office flipping through the folder marked 'SIDNEY PRESCOTT' It's loaded with newspaper articles and police reports and is basically a scrapbook of obsession. Sidney smirks. Kincaid has drawn little magic marker hearts around a picture of her. She's awakened from her daydream. The phone rings. Sid answers it. \nVOICE She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together. \nSIDNEY WHERE? \nVOICE I'll call you, when you're on your way. \nClick. The killer hangs up. Sidney breaks down crying. \nSIDNEY Fuck! \nWallace's keys rest on his desk. Sid ponders, takes them. She stands up when something inside her makes her open Wallace's drawer and dig around. She pulls up a fully loaded handgun. \nThat's the ticket. She closes the drawer, slinks out the side exit. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  WALLACE'S CAR - NIGHT \nSid speeds through rain-slicked streets. Her cellular rings. \nSIDNEY (into phone) Yeah? \nVOICE You follow directions good. Now let's wrap this production. Go to the Sunrise Studios backlot. I'll call you when you get there. \nClick. The killer hangs up. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  SUNRISE STUDIOS LOT - NIGHT \nSid parks Wallace's car alongside the studio gates. She gets out, stands on the hood of the car, begins to scale the wrought-iron fence. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  SOUNDSTAGE - STUDIO LOT - NIGHT \nSidney creeps through the darkened, abandon lot. Again, her cellular rings. Again, she answers it. \nSIDNEY (into phone) Alright, I'm here. Now what? \nVOICE You're doing real good. Can't you figure it out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro. \nSIDNEY I thought you wanted me here? \nClick the killer hangs up. Sid pockets her phone. She looks up, and is startled out of fright.  Posted alongside the sound stageis a huge production poster for STAB 3 with a life-size GHOST wielding a big knife. Sid knows she's in the right place. The door leading inside is half-open. Sid taps the holstered gun, slowly steps into the darkness. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  STAB 3 SETS - NIGHT \nSidney enters. She pauses. As a million things rush through her mind. To her this is like the ultimate return. Everything appears as she last remembers. Sid steps through the dark sets. Her phone rings. She answers it. \nSIDNEY (into phone) Alright I'm here, now show your  face so we can finish this. \nVOICE It's good to see you again Sidney. I was growing real impatient. Go ahead. Explore. I'll catch up with you later. \nThe killer hangs up. Sid pockets the phone. She walks past the MACHER GARAGE set. Instead of a foam TATUM body dangling from the doggy door, it's KINCAID'S CORPSE! Sidney flinches, covers her eyes. She walks on. \nINT.  BECKER HOUSE - SET - NIGHT \n", "test1_input": "Gale runs off. \nSIDNEY I can see nothing's changed. \nDEWEY No. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  SUNRISE STUDIO FILM ARCHIVES - DAY \nGale's banging on the door trying to gain access. Nobody home. Gale notices the card lock and the sign reading  'AUTHORIZED PERSONAL ONLY'. Gale smiles. Since when has this ever stopped her before. She reaches into her pocket book, pulling out a couple of credit cards, a video store card, etc. She tries them in the lock. NOTHING. \nA hand reaches down, grabs Gale from behind. She lets outa blood curdling scream. It's only JENNIFER. \nJENNIFER Geez. \nGALE What the hell are you doing? \nJENNIFER Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing? \nGALE I am Gale Weathers! \nJENNIFER Here's how I see it.  I've got no house, no movie, no gun, and I'm being stalked.  Because someone wants to kill me?  No, because someone wants to kill you. So now, starting now, I go where you go.  That way, if someone wants to kill me, I'll be with you, and since they really want to kill you, they won't kill me, they'll kill you.  Make sense? \nGALE None. \nJENNIFER You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter. \nGALE And as a sane person.  For you that must be quite a stretch. \nJENNIFER That's funny. \nGALE Ha. Maybe I should join SNL. \nJENNIFER Need to get in that building? \nGALE (sarcastically) No really? \nJENNIFER There a story in that building? \nGALE Possibly. \nJENNIFER (flashing a Sunrise Studios Key Card) Gale Weathers would find a way.

BASEMENT HALLWAY - ARCHIVES - DAY \nGale leads the way down the dark hall. \nJENNIFER Basements creep me out. \nGALE Really, you know you'd make a fascinating interview. Lifestyles of the Rich and Psychotic. \nJENNIFER Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more homes than I do. \nGALE (smiling) Oh I wish I got that one on tape.

Maybe you've heard of me? \nBianca shakes her head \"no\". \nBIANCA I don't watch TV and I hate books. Whatta you need? \nGALE Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you? \nBIANCA Nope. \nGALE (groans) Well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you. \nGale reaches into her pocket, slams down the picture of Sid's mom on Bianca's desk. Bianca looks up, totally unenthused. \nBIANCA Listen, I'm busy. Nobody has access to those files except studio execs. Can you please go away now? \nGALE Well if you won't work for me, will you work for the president? \nGale slaps a twenty dollar bill on the desk. Bianca looks up, a bit insulted, slides the money back. \nBIANCA The president . . . of the studio. \nJENNIFER Twenty dollars? Who are you Nancy Drew? \nJennifer turns to Bianca, slides off her ring. She slams the ring onto the desk. It's absolutely stunning. \nJENNIFER Go ahead. It's worth three grand easy. (to Gale) My Gale Weather's will stop at nothing to get the story. \nHow can Bianca resist. She smiles, takes the ring, slips it on her finger. \nBIANCA Follow me. \nGale reaches for her Twenty.

MAUREEN'S BEDROOM - PRESCOTT HOUSE SET - NIGHT \nGale and Sidney run into the master bedroom set, slamming the door shut and locking it. Sid looks around, her head already swimming from the chaos outside. However, what's inside utterly horrifies her. The walls, the furniture and the bed are splattered with blood. On the bed lies a corpse in a black rubber body bag (supposedly Maureen's body). The door buckles under the killer's blows. Gale and Sidney scream. They can't hold out much longer. \nGALE Jesus Christ Sidney get out of here! He can't get us both! \nA knife splinters through the door, inches from Gale's face. She screams. \nGALE RUNNN! \nSid backs away, hysterical. She raises up the gun, fires into the door.  BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Gale ducks out of the way. Silence. The door ceases to move.

He winces. \nThe second Ghost grabs Gale, holds the knife to her throat, stopping her in her tracks. Sid makes a beeline for the window, leaps through the glass. \nTHE WINDOW SHATTERS. \nSid comes flying out onto the patio awning. She rolls over onto the astro-turf grass, momentarily motionless.

I searched for a mother too, an actress named Rina Reynolds. I tried to find her my whole life. And four years ago I actually tracked her down, knocked on her door, thinking she'd welcome me back with open arms, but she had a new life and a new name, Maureen Prescott!

Sidney's deathly quiet. \nROMAN Roman Bridger, director. And brother. (a beat) She slammed the door in my face, Sid. Said I was Rina's child and Rina was dead. And it struck me, what a good idea! So I watched her, made a little home movie, a little family film. Seems Maureen, mom, really got around. I mean, Cotton Weary was one thing, everybody knew about that, but Billy's father, that was the key! Your boyfriend didn't like seeing his daddy in my movies. Didn't like it at all. And once I supplied the motive, all the kid needed was a few pointers. Have a partner to sell out in case you get caught, find someone to frame, it was like her was making a movie. \nSIDNEY All the nightmares. All the hell I went through was because of you, you spineless bastard! \nROMAN I'm a director Sid, I direct. For example, Angelina over there, (Angelina smiles) She's my partner. I can convince her to do anything.  We've been dating since I met her in Woodsboro. \nSIDNEY (dryly) Oh my God, Angie Crick? From English class? \nANGELINA That's me Sid. I always idolized you. You were always my hero. That's why I'm here Sidney. I wanted to make you proud. \nROMAN And I kinda keep her around cause it's a bit of a turn-on. You know, in the movies she's you Sid, so every time I jump her bones, I'm doing YOU, technically. \nSIDNEY (repulsed) Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit before! So lets get on with it! \nROMAN Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part. (pulls out tape recorder) With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice. (presses play) Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body. \nSIDNEY (off tape recorder) I can't take it anymore. This Hollywood exploitation of the nightmare I lived has to be stopped. I did this to make you all repent for your sins, and now I'm pleased I've got my message across. Good-bye. \nSid squirms. \nROMAN (clicking off tape recorder) Awesome. What'd I tell ya? Heh. Did youknow that John Milton, was my daddy? Yep, he's the one who fucked mommy dearest in the long run. His parties, his flings, exploited the Hollywood nobody! That's whyI had to make him pay. Daddy dearest is dead. Mommy's dead. Looks like I'm an orphan all alone in this world. What a good reason to -- STAB MYSELF! \nRoman stabs himself in the arm. He screams, goes stagger back into Angelina's arms. \nROMAN See Sidney, as amateur as Billy and Stu were, they laid the groundwork for this! See Sidney, they also set the stage for you! Introducing to the world Sidney the victim! Sidney the survivor! Sidney the star! \nRoman continues stabbing himself. In the shoulder. In the side.In the leg.

Cause face it Sidney, in this world, the bad guys win! \nSIDNEY Roman knock it off! Do you people even know why you kill people? You kill people cause you choose to and not because of any other fucking reason! \nANGELINA (screaming) Roman make her stop! Make her stop baby she's freaking me out! \nROMAN (screaming) God damn it Sidney! \nRoman lunges at Sidney. Sid screams, takes off through the kitchen. Gale rolls herself off the couch. Angela runs over and kicks her in the ribs. \nGALE (coughing) Hey bitch, don't ever use prop cuffs to restrain Gale Weathers. \nGale pops off the handcuffs. \nGALE (leaping up) I know all the tricks! \nGale barrels into Angelina, tackling her into the coffee table before she has a chance to move. Angelina struggles to raise her knife. \nMEANWHILE -- \nROMAN, \n--chases Sid into the foyer. She races past the spot where Dewey fell earlier. He's gone! Roman jumps at her. Sid disappears into another room.  THE CHASE continues. \nGALE AND ANGELINA, \nContinue the fight. Gale's slamming Angelina's head against the hardwood floor. Angelina swipes, slashing Gale along the side, deeply. Gale screams, begins to crawl away. She kicks Angelina in the face. Angelina drops the knife. Gale stands up, begins to back away. \nSIDNEY-- \n", "test3_true": "SUDDENLY, \nWHAM! The laundry room door swings open and the GHOST emerges, KNIFE in hand. He buries the knife deep into Roman's chest, sending him flying backwards. Sidney screams. The ghost stops in his tracks, pulling off his mask -- \nIT'S ONLY DEWEY. He can barely stand up. He's bleeding profusely from his wounds. \nDewey and Sid embrace. \nSIDNEY Dewey my God I thought you were dead. \nDEWEY Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that. \nSCREAMING O.S. \nSIDNEY DEWEY! IT'S GALE! \nSidney and Dewey race into -- \nLIVING ROOM -- \nGale's got Angelina in a headlock, right beneath the TV UNIT. \nGALE (screaming) THIS IS FOR THE STARDOM I NEVER HAD! BITCH! \nGale releases, leaps up, she pushes the TV set down onto Angelina's head. Angelina screams, her body trembling from the electric shocks and high voltage. \nSID and DEWEY stand in the doorway, breathless. Gale approaches them. She and Dewey embrace tightly. \nANGELINA's twitching corpse goes limp. \nSIDNEY, spots a gun on the mantle. She grabs it, cocks it. \n--FOYER -- \nTHE THREE SURVIVORS STEP INTO THE FOYER.  Sid looks down at Roman's corpse. \nDEWEY Watch out Sid. Randy said the killer's always superhuman. \nSIDNEY He wasn't superhuman Dewey. He wasn't superhuman at all. \nTHEN A HORRIFYING SCREAM rips through the air. \nANGELINA comes racing out of the living room, face a blackened, Kentucky-fried mess.

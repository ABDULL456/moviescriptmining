PETE It's all dark up there. 
DEBBIE What? Why are you looking? 
PETE I didn't mean to look, I just said, `Hey- woah!' There it was. 
DEBBIE Maybe she's wearing dark underwear. 
PETE Yeah. Maybe she has underwear that has a picture of a vagina painted on it. 
DEBBIE Stop looking. 
Desi comes down to help a CUSTOMER at the front of the store. 
DESI Maybe some deep oranges and browns and maybe dark greens? That would really play up your features. 
CUSTOMER I'll just take out my AmEx and you pick what stuff you think is good. 
EXT. BACKYARD - DAY 
We see quick cuts of Debbie playing with the kids on the trampoline outside. She does a full flip and lands on her feet. Pete is nowhere to be found. 
DEBBIE Woo! Where's daddy? 
SADIE I think he went to poop. 
DEBBIE Pete! 
INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Debbie walks down the hall and into the bathroom without knocking. Pete is on the toilet playing Scrabble on his iPad. 
DEBBIE What are you doing? 
PETE Going to the bathroom. 
DEBBIE We're all downstairs waiting for you. You've been up here for a really long time now. 
PETE Oh, I'm almost done. I'll be down in a second. 
DEBBIE Charlotte just did her first flip on the trampoline, and she landed on her feet. She was really proud of herself. 
PETE Oh, that's great. 
DEBBIE And you missed it. 
PETE She'll do it again. 
DEBBIE It's just that this is the fourth time you've gone to the bathroom today. 
PETE Give me a break. 
DEBBIE Why is your instinct to escape? 
PETE It's not my instinct to escape from you. It is my instinct to come into the bathroom when I need to go to the bathroom. 
DEBBIE How come I don't smell anything? 
PETE It's because I shoved an Altoid up my ass before I came in here. 
DEBBIE Let me see then. 
PETE What? 
DEBBIE Let me see! 
PETE No, I'm not going to let you see. 
DEBBIE You're not going to let me see because you're not taking a poop. 
PETE I've been flushing as I go. 
DEBBIE You're flushing as you go? Who takes a half hour to go to the bathroom? 
PETE (thinks for a second) John Goodman. 
She angrily grabs his iPad and walks out. 
PETE (CONT'D) Don't press Enter! I'm not sure I want to make that move! 
EXT. SMALL NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT 
A sign outside reads: "Tonight Only: Graham Parker" 
INT. SMALL NIGHTCLUB - STAGE - NIGHT 
Pete stands on stage speaking to a small crowd. 
PETE You know, when I started this label, my dream was to work with musicians and bands whose music I just admired so much. The person that I thought, "My god, wouldn't it be incredible to work with" was Graham Parker. Tonight we have him. Solo. Because we couldn't afford to fly in The Rumour. 
The crowd applauds as Graham Parker (60's) leaps on stage. 
Pete and Debbie watch Graham sing a very moving song. The song is fantastic and personal, but clearly not commercial. 
We watch Debbie. Although the music is great, it's a little depressing and not working on her. She quickly gets bored. 
INT. CAR - NIGHT 
Pete and Debbie are driving home. 
DEBBIE It's just not my kind of music. 
PETE Really. What is your kind of music? 
DEBBIE I like Lady Gaga.

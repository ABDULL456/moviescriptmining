BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) And he didn't see Daisy crossing the street... 
Daisy and her friend crossing the Street, Daisy doing the Pirouette... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) ...and that taxi hit Daisy...

196   INT. A HOSPITAL ROOM, PARIS, FRANCE - DAY, 1954               196 
We see Benjamin coming into the hospital room in France...Daisy, fully immobilized, lying in a hospital bed... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) And her leg was crushed... 
She's still, her eyes closed. Sensing him, she stirs. And then she sees him. 
BENJAMIN Hello, Daisy... 
DAISY Who told you? 
BENJAMIN Your friend wired me. 
DAISY That was very kind of you... to come all the way here, to see that I was alright. 
BENJAMIN You would have done the same for me... 
And her first reaction, to how young he is... 
DAISY My God, look at you. You're perfect.... 
Which she isn't... She's quiet, and she suddenly says:

DAISY (CONT'D) I wish you hadn't. I wish you hadn't come here. 
He's dead still. 
DAISY (CONT'D) I don't want you to see me like this... 
She turns over... as if she didn't see him he wouldn't be there... Before he can say anything... A Nurse comes in saying something in French... She pulls the curtains around the bed... Benjamin waits... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Her leg had been broken in five places.... and with therapy, and time, she might be able to stand...maybe even walk... 
The Nurse leaves... Benjamin comes into the circle of curtains... It's reminiscent of when they sat under the table... the sheets over them... in their private world... But this time she lays in the hospital bed her back to him... 
BENJAMIN I'll get a room... and once you can leave you'll come home with me to New Orleans. Where you can be with people who love you. 
She suddenly turns... 
DAISY What home? Who's we? I'm not going back to New Orleans. New Orleans is your home... I don't have a home... I haven't been home for five years... I'm not going anywhere with you... 
BENJAMIN Alright, I'll stay here in Paris... I'll help you with anything you need... 
DAISY Benjamin...! I know I'm feeling sorry for myself... But it wasn't supposed to be like this... (MORE)

196    CONTINUED: (2)                                            196 DAISY (CONT'D) Do you understand, I don't want to be with you... I tried to tell you that in New York... You just don't listen... 
BENJAMIN You'll change your mind. 
DAISY We're not little children playing under the table... Remember, when you came to New York. You didn't belong there. I didn't want to be with you then, I don't want to be with you now! I want you to leave! I'm not going anywhere with you! I want you to stay out of my life! 
And she turns away from him again...It's dead still... and we look at her staring at the curtains... And after some moments she turns back to look at Benjamin... And there are just the curtains billowing in the breeze... Benjamin is gone...

CUT TO: 
266A   INT. BUS - NIGHT                                         266A 
Chris lays on the floor. CU Chris: Orange light twinkles in his eyes. Chris' POV: through the bus window, we see the orange glow of smoke rising into the air. CU: Chris writes in his diary log. 
CHRIS (V.O.) Set small signal fire today - watched it die tonight. 
Back to POV as the ambient orange light fades into the blackness of smoke. 
CUT TO: 
267    INT. BUS - DAY                                            267 The diary/log: DAY 100 - MADE IT. BUT IN WEAKEST CONDITION OF LIFE. TOO WEAK TO WALK OUT. HAVE LITERALLY BECOME TRAPPED IN THE WILD - NO GAME IN SIGHT. 
A SUBTLE DRUM (HEART)BEAT BEGINS OVER: 
Chris plops himself down into the middle of the bus. He shakes his head as if trying to say something, and then considers his rifle and abundant ammunition. But taking his own life to avoid the agony of starvation is not an option for him. "No, no, no, don't do this to me." The frustration builds enough adrenaline in him to scream out. 
He does, but with a low, gurgled animal sound. He shakes it off and looks to his copy of Doctor Zhivago for distraction. Thumbing through the pages he focuses his eyes on the page - 
ANGLE: The page: what he reads: 
CHRIS (V.0)(O.C.) And that an unshared happiness is not happiness... 
Chris steals his pencil from within the pages of the book, scribbling across the page: 
CHRIS (V.O.)(O.C.) (CONT'D) HAPPINESS ONLY REAL WHEN SHARED. 
He flips backwards a couple of pages to where he had written the quote: 
CHRIS (V.O.)(O.C.) (CONT'D) CALL EVERYTHING BY ITS RIGHT NAME. 
He tears the back cover off the book and scratching the pencil across its blank side, writing these words quickly, as if in panic: 
I HAVE HAD A HAPPY LIFE AND THANK THE LORD.    GOODBYE AND MAY GOD BLESS ALL! 
And now, these words arrive slowly as we HEAR Chris repeating: CHRIS (O.C.) (CONT'D) (with a weak voice) Call everything by its right name. 
The drumbeat increases as he signs the note: 
CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON MCCANDLESS. 
We move from the page back up to Chris. We see that he has put on his eyeglasses to strengthen the vision of his weakening sight. He removes them, folds them, and lays them by his side. His body begins to tremble. His eyes dance wildly. 
The drumming intensifies. 
Chris takes one last look out the window. The sun is covered by a well-defined and puffy cloud. 
His arm nearing spasm reaches up to the bunk, grasping at the blue sleeping bag made by his mother. 
With great suffering and shattering trembles, he forces his body to defy its agony and pushes it into the sleeping bag. 
SKYWARD, the cloud obscuring the sun. 
Drumbeats ESCALATE - BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! We TIGHTEN on Chris' anguished face. (Director's note: These CU's on Chris' face, combine both static and hand-held CUs, upside down and right-side up moving, zooms, and push-ins. Straight, side, and dutch angles. Perhaps some intermittent distortion.) 
268   INT./EXT. BUS                                             268 
We INTERCUT between Chris and the sky in a dance transitioning to the next world. It is hopeful, anguished, sad, and elated. 
269   INT./EXT. ANNANDALE HOUSE - DAY                           269 
Chris, approaching the Annandale house.    His backpack on and body healthy. 
Billie parts the curtains, ecstatic to see Chris approach, alive and healthy. 
We SEE but do not hear her call to Walt. 
A smiling Chris steps up the curb, approaching home. 
Walt and Billie - we PUSH INTO them as they gleefully run out the front door to their returning son. 
PUSH INTO Chris - he dispatches his backpack to the ground and runs toward his parents' embrace. 
CHRIS (V.O.) What if you saw me running into your arms... 
Chris, Walt, and Billie on the cusp of a jubilant and loving embrace! 
CHRIS (V.O.) (CONT'D) Would you see then... 
The DRUMMING resumes with a BLAST OF BASS and before an embrace is possible... CHRIS (V.O.) (CONT'D) ...what I see now? A SUDDEN CUT TO: 
270   INT. BUS                                                  270 
TOTAL SILENCE 
Chris looking at the sky, a cathartic tear falls from his left eye. Another from his right as the obscuring cloud clears the sun. 
Chris: The LAST, AIRY EXPULSION OF HIS BREATH. 
His open face as the clearing light of the sun shines in his eyes. It is a face of peace, love, a face of true, deep serenity. 
The eyes joyously open and the corners of his mouth ease into the subtle smile of euphoric wisdom. 
That's the way he settles to stillness, looking directly into our camera.

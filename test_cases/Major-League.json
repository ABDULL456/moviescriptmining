{"train": "\"MAJOR LEAGUE\" \nScreenplay by \nDavid S. Ward \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nFADE IN: TITLES APPEAR ON BLACK B.G. \nTITLES END and we WIDEN to reveal that the black b.g. is actually the sludge-clogged surface of the Cuyahoga River. We TILT UP from the river to reveal the city of Cleveland, then follow with a series of shots of Cleveland landmarks. \nINT. THE INJUN DINER - DAY \nThree men in Cleveland Indian baseball caps sit at the counter. BOBBY JAMES, 22-year-old grad student, VIC BOLITO, 30-year-old telephone worker, and JOHNNY WYNN, 45-year-old house painter. THELMA GORDON, 65-year-old waitress, delivers their breakfast. \nTHELMA Spring training starts the twelfth. How do you think the Indians will do this year? \nVIC They don't look too good. \nThe other two shake their heads in contemplation of this sorry fact. \nINT. MEN'S CLUB - DAY \nA 45-year-old BUSINESS EXECUTIVE is talking to a fellow club member over lunch. \nBUSINESS EXECUTIVE They don't look particularly good, do they? \nEXT. CLEVELAND DOCKS - DAY \nTwo LONGSHOREMEN are talking while they unload a freighter. \nLONGSHOREMEN I'll tell ya. They don't look very fuckin' good. \nEXT. CLEVELAND MUNICIPAL STADIUM - DAY \nDown on the field, two KOREAN GROUNDSKEEPERS speak Korean as they resod the outfield. \nGROUNDSKEEPER (in subtitles) They're shitty. \nWe TILT UP from the field to a glass-enclosed area on the third deck. \nINT. GLASS-ENCLOSED AREA - DAY \nIt's the Cleveland Indians' conference room. Three men are seated around the table; CHARLIE DONOVAN. the manager, PHIL BUTLER, public relations head, JERRY SIMMONS, operations director and LYLE MATTHEWS director of player personnel Donovan taps his pencil impatiently, obviously waiting for somebody. \nDONOVAN (checking his watch) Thirty minutes late. Think she'll show? \nMATTHEWS She's got to. She's the damn owner now. \nDONOVAN She didn't last week. She was having a guava facial. \nAs Butler tries to figure out what a guava facial is, the conference room doors swing open and a muscular MALE SECRETARY- BODYGUARD enters, clearing the way for MRS. RACHEL PHELPS, a flashy, striking woman in her early forties. Despite the designer clothes she favors, there is the hint of something less refined about her. She carries a Pekinese dog, CHA-CHA on her left hip. \nRACHEL Good morning, gentlemen. Welcome to another season of Indians' baseball. \nThe men applaud, but their hearts are barely in it. The Secretary-Bodyguard pulls out a chair at the head of the table and Rachel sits. \nRACHEL I know that it may not seem the same without Donald here this year, but I promise you by the end of the season this team will have made history. \nSeveral eyes roll up around the room. \nRACHEL (picking up a newspaper) Unfortunately there are some in the press who feel that... (reading from the page) \"the ex-showgirl wife of Donald Phelps has no business being the owner of a major league baseball team.\" \nRachel crumbles the paper and throws it away. \nRACHEL Obviously, Donald didn't feel that way or he wouldn't have left the team to me. And I was more than showgirl. I was a dancer. Now, I know some of you have doubts about my ability to run this franchise. God help you if I ever find out about it. \nThis causes a few nervous glances in the room. \nRACHEL Spring training begins in two weeks. (throwing a sheet of paper on the table) Here's the list of people we'll be inviting to camp this year. \nDonovan, Butler and Simmons pour over the list. \nRACHEL I could sit here and tell you what a great year we're gonna have, but the facts are we lost the two best players we had to free agency. We haven't won a pennant in 30 years. We haven't even finished in the first division for 15. Obviously it's time to make some changes. What do ya think? \nSIMMONS I never heard of half these guys. And the ones I do know are way past their prime. \nDONOVAN Most of these guys never had a prime. \nBUTLER (pointing to the sheet) This guy here is dead. \nRACHEL Cross him off then. \nBUTLER (under his breath) Let's not be hasty. \nINT. MOTEL ROOM - MORNING \nThe room is a total mess. The back door is off its hinges and a few chickens have wandered in. As they peck around the debris, we PAN the room, taking in beer cans, food wrappers and finally a trail of hastily discarded clothes, both male and female. \nWe reach the bed and find our hero, JAKE TAYLOR, 35, and with a couple days growth of stubble, passed out on his face. Sprawled across him asleep is a MEXICAN WOMAN in her late twenties. She's not great looking, but at least she's overweight. Taylor's hand fumbles to the RINGING telephone. \nTAYLOR Yeh. \nIt's Charlie Donovan calling from his office in Cleveland. We CUT BACK AND FORTH between the two as we will in subsequent phone scenes. \nDONOVAN Hello, Jake? This is Charlie Donovan, new G.M. of the Cleveland Indians. \nTAYLOR (skeptical) Yeh... \nDONOVAN I wanted to call and say the organization remembers you fondly from the years you played here and we'd love to have you come to spring training for a shot at this year's club. \nTAYLOR Who is this? \nDONOVAN What? \nTAYLOR Is that you, Tolbert? This isn't very funny, ya know. I'm hung over. My knees are killin' me. If you were gonna pull this shit, you could've at least said you were from the Yankees. \nTaylor struggles to get a look up at the girl on top of him. \nTAYLOR (still to Donovan) By the way, you were with me last night. Who's this girl on top of me? \nDonovan is baffled by this whole line of conversation. \nTAYLOR Tolbert? Tolbert? Screw it. \nTaylor hangs up, leaving Donovan staring into his phone. Taylor looks up to see TOLBERT standing in the doorway. \nTAYLOR Tolbert. \nTOLBERT Who the hell were you talkin' to? \nOn Taylor's reaction, we... \nCUT TO: \nINT. TOLEDO TIRE STORE - DAY \nWe PICK UP LOU BROWN, a portly man in his early fifties, making his way to his glass-partitioned office. \nSECRETARY Lines three and four are waiting for you, Mr. Brown. One guy about the TR- 70's. \nBROWN (picking up the phone) Tire World. \nDONOVAN Lou? This is Charlie Donovan, the new G.M. of the Cleveland Indians. Listen, Lou, I hope you're sittin' down 'cause I got an offer you probably been dreamin' about your whole life. We been watchin' your progress down there at Toledo with a lotta interest and well... (a dramatic pause) How would you like to manage the Indians this year? \nFor a moment there's silence on the line, then: \nBROWN I don't know... \nDONOVAN (incredulous) What do ya mean you don't know? This is a chance to manage in the big leagues. \nBROWN Lemme think it over, will ya, Charlie. I got a guy on the other line about some whitewalls. I'll talk to ya later. \nBrown clicks off. Donovan puts his head down on his desk. \nINT. CHARLIE DONOVAN'S OFFICE - DAY \nDonovan's on the phone to another player. \nDONOVAN Rick, we heard about your pitching out at Portland last year... \nRICKY VAUGHN \nGood-looking, muscular, 19-year-old. Sleeveless black T-shirt. Talking on a wall phone in a nondescript room. \nVAUGHN I'm, ah, not with them anymore... \nVaughn has been working, sweating slightly. He takes off his cap to mop his brow -- revealing a RADICAL HAIRCUT with PIGTAIL. He sports a RING in his left ear. \nDONOVAN We'd still like to take a look at ya at our spring camp in Arizona, March first. \nLONG SHOT - VAUGHN \nIn the b.g., Vaughn is on the phone. In the f.g., we see security bars. Vaughn's in a Youth Authority prison. \nVAUGHN Yeh, well, I'm not sure I can make it by then. \nDONOVAN Don't worry, we're gettin' you out on a sort of work furlough deal. Any questions? \nVAUGHN Yeh. Where's Cleveland? \ncoming out of the stadium, his bats and gloves over his shoulder. He has on his spikes and a pair of boxer shorts. \nINT. BEAT-UP MEXICAN BUS - DAY \nTaylor sits in the back seat. He has six Coke bottles filled with sand strapped to his ankles. He lifts his legs up and down to strengthen his muscles. \nOMIT \nSequence omitted from original script. \nEXT. INDIANS' TRAINING CAMP PRACTICE FIELD - DAY \nDonovan, Brown and two of his coaches, PEPPER LEACH (pitching) and DUKE TEMPLE (hitting) are on the field, witnessing the arrival of their \"troops.\" First to arrive is: \nTAYLOR \nHe gets out of a taxi and goes to the trunk to get his bats and luggage. \nDONOVAN This looks like Jake Taylor. \nBrown turns around from a conversation with Temple. \nBROWN He was an Allstar in Boston, wasn't he? \nDONOVAN Yeh. \nPEPPER Wish we had him two years ago. \nDONOVAN We did. \nPEPPER Four years ago then. \nINT. PLAYER'S BARRACKS - DAY \nLike an Army barracks. Rows of bunk beds seperated by lockers. Taylor walks in with Temple, the hitting instructor. \nTAYLOR What happened to the private rooms? \nTEMPLE We're on an austerity program. This is what happens when you finish 24 games out. \nBROWN, PEPPER, TEMPLE AND DONOVAN \nback at the field, supervising the arrival of more players. \nThe first is a tall, muscular Latin, PEDRO CERRANO, dressed in black from head to toe. He arrives on foot, carrying a black suitcase and pulling a black bat case on wheels. He looks like a gunfighter coming into Dodge. \nBROWN Who's that? \nDONOVAN I think it's Cerrano. Defected from Cuba. Wanted religious freedom. \nBROWN What's his religion? \nDONOVAN Voodoo. \nBLACK AND TAN ROLLS-ROYCE \npulling into the parking lot. Out steps RODGER DORN, high- priced third baseman. Brown eyes him with vague disapproval. \nBROWN Thought you didn't have any high- priced talent. \nDONOVAN (sheepish) I forgot about Dorn, 'cause he's only high-priced. Got him as a free agent three years ago. \nBROWN Still hits the ball pretty well, doesn't he? \nDONOVAN Yeh, he just can't field it. \nDorn pulls his golf clubs out of the car. \nBROWN We'll shape him up. \nWILLIE HAYES \na 22-year-old black, pulling up in a '72 VW Beetle which he's got a Cadillac grille on. He steps out in his shades and sharkskin suit. \nDONOVAN Don't recognize this guy. \nHayes strolls up and introduces himself. \nHAYES Say hey, Willie Mays Hayes here. I play like Mays and run like Hayes. \nBROWN Lou Brown. Nice to meet ya, Hayes. \nHAYES Thanks. Well, I gotta get my stuff... \nHayes hustles off toward his car. \nHAYES \nlooking through the chain-link fence surrounding the field. \nDORN AND GENTRY AGAIN \nTemple brings them to their marks and blows his whistle. Dorn and Gentry take off. \nSuddenly Hayes, in his pajamas and bare feet comes streaking toward the starting line in hot pursuit. Dorn and Gentry a good 10-yard lead, but Hayes is coming like a bullet. We go to SLOW MOTION as Hayes draws even at the 80-yard mark and blasts on by to win by five. This kid is fast. Brown and Pepper give each other the \"Who was that Masked Man\" look. \nBROWN Get him a uniform. \nEXT. THE PRACTICE FIELD - LONG SHOT - DAY \nThe players are spread out on the field doing calisthenics, counting off in unison. \nTAYLOR \nstruggling through a series of pushups. He glances over in disbelief at Vaughn and Cerrano, who are doing them like pistons in competition with each other. Cerrano even starts doing them one-handed. \nHayes isn't doing them at all; merely pulling his head up and down while leaving his body on the ground. \nHARRIS C'mon, Hayes, let's do 'em right. \nHAYES Hey, my philosophy is no pain, no pain. \nEXT. THE BATTING CAGE - DAY \nTaylor is crouched behind the plate, warming up his arm. Catching pitches and throwing them half-speed down to second. Brown drifts over. \nBROWN How the knees holdin' up, Jake? \nTAYLOR Great. Never been better. \nBROWN Mobility's good? No problem gettin' off the throw to second? \nTAYLOR No problem. \nBROWN I need a catcher, Jake. Somebody who can keep this team together on the field. You were a helluva player when you were sound, but around the league they think you can't take the pounding anymore. \nTAYLOR Around the league they're wrong. \nBROWN I'm gonna have to put you to the test, ya know. So, I want the absolute truth here. Are you 100 percent? \nTAYLOR Yeh. Would I bullshit about somethin' like that? \nBROWN (walking away) You better if you wanna make this team. \nTaylor smiles and fires one full-speed down to second. It bounces two feet in front of the bag. \nEXT. BATTING CAGE - DAY \nBrown is watching batting practice. \nHayes steps into the cage and begins a preparatory ritual worthy of Babe Ruth -- rubbing dirt on his hands, stretching, knocking dirt off his spikes, twirling the bat, etc. A real slugger's routine. \nBROWN C'mon, Hayes, this isn't the All Star Game. Get up to the damn plate. \nHayes gets in and takes his stance. On the first pitch, he takes a mighty cut and hits a pop-fly to the pitcher's mound. We take QUICK CUTS of the next three pitches. Hayes takes prodigious swings at all of them, producing three more pop- ups, none out of the infield. Brown calls a halt. \nBROWN Well, you may run like Mays, but you hit like shit. \nHAYES My stroke'll come back once I get warmed up. \nTEMPLE (referring to some stats) Never did get warmed up last year. Hit .211 at Maine. I looked him up. \nBROWN I think Mr. Hayes shows some promise. His speed could be a big asset. \nPEPPER (aside) For what? Running back to the dugout? \nBROWN You gotta stop swingin' for the fences though, Hayes. All you're gonna do is give yourself a hernia. With your speed you should be hittin' the ball on the ground, leggin' 'em out. Every time I see you hit one in the air, you owe me twenty pushups. \nHAYES Hey, no problem. \nThe next pitch comes in. Hayes swings and pops it up. \nHAYES Shit. \nAs he gets down to do his twenty, Brown turns to Temple. \nBROWN Sometimes you can teach a guy to hit. You can't teach him to run. \nBROWN AND PEPPER \ncoming over to where Vaughn is tossing some casual warm-up pitches to Jake. \nVAUGHN What do you mean? \nBROWN I think somebody's been havin' fun with you. \nWe GO TO Vaughn, his faced a mask of anger and embarrassment. \nTHE LOCKER ROOM AGAIN \nVaughn charges across the room and jumps Dorn. The men grapple and fight all over the room, until Taylor finally gets them separated. \nDORN (to Vaughn) What's the matter, little lady? Can't you take a joke? \nVaughn gives Dorn a look that indicates this isn't over. Lou Brown enters the room. \nBROWN Can I have your attention, please? I counted up your ballots for team captain and I think you chose the right guy. If you hadn't, I woulda told you he won anyway. Mr. C for the year -- Jake Taylor. \nThe team breaks into applause and whistles as Taylor's name is announced. Dorn is the only one who seems unhappy about it. As Taylor accepts the congratulations of his teammates, he turns to Vaughn. \nTAYLOR Forget about Dorn. You got other things to do. \nVAUGHN Like what? \nTAYLOR Packing for Cleveland. \nTaylor gives him a wide smile. Vaughn finally allows himself one. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE CLEVELAND SKYLINE - DAY \nSuch as it is. We MOVE DOWN to the same diner we saw during the opening of the film. \nINT. INJUN DINER - DAY \nThe same three guys as before are at the counter. \nTHELMA You see the new lineup the Indians got? \nBOBBY I never heard of most of 'em. \nINT. EXECUTIVE LIMOUSINE - DAY \nThe Business Executive is talking to the limo driver as he reads the sports section. \nBUSINESS EXECUTIVE I don't know the majority of these names. \nEXT. CLEVELAND DOCKS - DAY \nThe two Longshoremen again, looking at a paper. \nLONGSHOREMAN Who are these fuckin' guys? \nEXT. CLEVELAND MUNICIPAL STADIUM - DAY \nThe two Korean Groundskeepers again, dragging the infield. \nGROUNDSKEEPER (in subtitles) They're shitty. \nINT. CLEVELAND MUNICIPAL STADIUM - DAY \nTaylor is alone in the stadium, standing near home plate in his street clothes, taking in the massive stadium, remembering glories past. He steps into the batter's box and takes his stance. \nTAYLOR (to himself) Two down. Bottom of the ninth. \nTaylor points to the left field stands. He imagines a pitch coming in, takes a mighty swing and admires the flight of the imaginary ball as it arches high in the mid-day sky, landing deep in the left field seats. Breaking into his home run trot, he circles the bases, slapping the third base coach's hand and exchanging low fives with his teamates as he reaches the plate. \nSuddenly, his reverie is interrupted by the sound of applause. He turns and looks in the dugout, where Hayes and Vaughn are giving him a hand. \nHAYES Really got all of that one. \nVAUGHN What was it? A slider? \nTaylor is too embarrassed to reply. \nINT. CLEVELAND RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nOne of Cleveland's finest. Taylor, Hayes and Vaughn are seated at a table. \nTAYLOR What are you gonna have? \nHAYES I don't know. What language is this? \nTAYLOR French. \nHAYES They got patty melts over there? \nHayes lies in the dust humiliated. \nDOYLE Well, so much for that. \nDoyle takes a long pull on his Coke and we GO INTO A MONTAGE depicting the Indians' progressive disintegration in this game. We see: \nA) THREE FIELDERS converging on a short pop fly into left field. They all collide and go down in a heap as the ball drops untouched. \nB) DORN playing a grounder off his hip. He fumbles it, picks it up, fumbles it again. No play. \nC) TAYLOR crouched behind the plate, but up off his haunches, ready to throw. We hear the voice of his thoughts. \nTAYLOR'S VOICE Guy's goin'. Gotta be goin'... get the throw up. Don't bounce the damn ball. \nThe runner on first takes off as the pitch comes in. Taylor catches the ball and fires down to second. The ball sails three feet over the second baseman's head and on into center field. Taylor stands there, disgusted. \nTAYLOR'S VOICE Nice throw, dickhead. \nD) CERRANO striking out on a curve ball. He bawls his bat out on the way to the dugout. \nE) THE THREE FIELDERS we saw before, converging on another pop fly into short left. This time all three dive off at the last instant to avoid a collision. Once again the ball drops untouched. \nEND MONTAGE. \nTHE SCOREBOARD \nIt shows Yankees 4, Indians 0 after five innings. \nDOYLE UP IN THE BOOTH \nThere are two empty Coca-Cola cups near the mike. He's working on a third. \nDOYLE Top of the sixth. Rookie sensation, Ricky Vaughn, on to pitch now. You can close the book on Winters... \nVaughn stands on the mound rubbing up the baseball with the same intensity we saw in the locker room. \nTAYLOR Easy does it, Ricky. We're only four down. We're still in this thing. \nPEPPER Don't worry if you're off the plate on a few pitches. Doesn't hurt to put the fear of God in a hitter. \nVaughn nods and continues to grind the ball as Pepper and Taylor leave. The Yankee Hitter steps in. \nVaughn winds and fires a screamer. Taylor has to leap high to come down with it. \nDOYLE (V.O.) First pitch is a little high... \nThe Yankee Hitter is slightly unnerved by this pitch. \nYANKEE HITTER This guy kinda wild? \nTAYLOR I figure you got a 30% chance to survive this at bat. \nANOTHER PITCH to the Yankee hitter. It's outside. \nDOYLE (V.O.) Ball four. \nANOTHER PITCH to a SECOND YANKEE HITTER. It's low. \nDOYLE (V.O.) Ball eight. \nANOTHER PITCH to a THIRD YANKEE HITTER. He has to jump over it. \nDOYLE (V.O.) Low, and Vaughn has walked the bases loaded on twelve straight pitches. By the laws of probability, you'd think one of those coulda drifted over the plate. \nTHE BLEACHER BAND \nBobby gives the downbeat and, in honor of Vaughn, the three men stand to pound out a version of \"Wild Thing\" on the tom- toms. Bobby does the vocal. \nBOBBY Wild thing, You make my heart sing, You walk everything. \nPepper has reached the mound... \nPEPPER Okay kid. I think we got 'em scared enough now. Time to get a few of 'em out. \nVaughn nods. He's plenty upset with himself. \nPEPPER Just relax, and keep the arm up on top. Gotta throw strikes. No place at the inn for this guy. \nHe gives Vaughn a pat on the butt, and goes back to the dugout. \nThe Yankee hitter, HAYWOOD, stands in. He's the first baseman who tagged Hayes out. \nHAYWOOD Hey, Taylor, what you doin' back up here? \nTAYLOR Couldn't cut it in the Mexican League. \nLYNN Let's talk in my office, okay? \nTAYLOR I don't wanna talk in your office. \nLynn starts to walk. We'll FOLLOW them as they make their way through the library. Lynn tries to keep the conversation hushed. Taylor could give a shit. \nLYNN I told you I don't think it's a good idea for us to see each other. \nTAYLOR Why not? \nLYNN We don't have anything in common. Sometimes I wonder if we ever did. \nTAYLOR What are you talkin' about? We were both athletes, world class, hot for each other. What more can you have in common? \nLYNN I stopped bein' an athlete three years ago. Books are my life now. \nJake suppresses a smile. \nLYNN Don't you dare laugh, Jake. In two years I've put together one of the best special collections departments in the country. \nTAYLOR So what is it? You're still sore I never read Moby Dick? \nLYNN You never read anything I asked you to. \nTAYLOR Not like what's-his-name at the restaurant? \nLYNN His name is Tom, and keep your voice down. \nTAYLOR What do ya see in this guy? \nLYNN He's stable. He's intelligent... and I've never found him in bed with a stewardess. \nTAYLOR That's 'cause no stewardess would have him. Wouldn't you rather be with somebody who's in demand? \nLYNN Just like always, you don't take anything seriously. Everything's a joke to you. \nTAYLOR C'mon, Lynn, for Christ sake, I'm just tryin' to loosen things up a little. I'm gettin' frostbite here. \nLynn stops and turns to face him. \nLYNN Tom and I are getting married in the fall. \nTaylor is momentarily floored by the revelation. \nTAYLOR What? That's crazy, Lynn. I got plans for us. \nLYNN (walking again) What plans? \nTAYLOR I was gonna play another a year or two, then we go to Hawaii, and have a couple kids who grow up to be Olympic champions. \nLYNN (stopping again) How can you think stuff like that? I haven't seen you in two years. You never even wrote me a letter. \nTAYLOR I'm sorry, Lynn, but I wasn't exactly proud of my situation. C'mon, you didn't think about me at all since I been gone? \nLYNN (walking again) Not so loud, Jake. \nTAYLOR Remember the three nights we spent on the beach in Vera Cruz? You have nights like that with Mr. Briefcase? \nLYNN (stopping again) What about the night you had in Detroit with Miss Dairy Queen? \nThey're in the large reading room now. \nTAYLOR What was I supposed to do? She bet me fifty bucks she had a better body than you. I had to defend your honor. \nLYNN (whirling on him and exploding) What a bunch of bullshit! (exasperated) I have a much better body than she does. \nWith this the whole reading room turns around and stares at her. Lynn is mortified by her outburst. Taylor tries to smooth it over. \nTAYLOR (addressing the library patrons) She's right. Take it from me, she really does. I mean Miss Dairy Queen has quantity, I give her that, but the, ah, quality just isn't there. \nNice job, Jake. Lynn is still mortified. \nTAYLOR How many think Lynn oughta give me another shot? \nMost of the hands in the room shoot up. \nTAYLOR The ayes have it. \nLYNN (walking off again) You haven't changed at all, have you? \nTAYLOR I'm afraid I have or I wouldn't be here. C'mon, Lynn, I don't wanna do time for things that happened years ago. \nLYNN (turning back to him) I'm sorry, Jake. You'll always be the little boy who wouldn't grow up. \nLynn starts off for her office door. \nCLAIRE Here in Cleveland? I didn't know they still had a team. \nTAYLOR Yeh, we have uniforms and everything. It's really great. \nTOM (handing Jake his beer) They're last right now, but hopefully moving up, eh, Jake? \nTom clinks his glass with Jake's beer, the slight condescension in his manner not lost on Taylor. Lynn is uncomfortable with this whole situation. Janice moves a bit closer to Taylor. It's obvious she finds him attractive. \nJANICE I'm told that baseball players make very good salaries these days. \nTAYLOR That depends on how good they are, I guess. \nJANICE How good are you? \nLynn is irritated by Janice's directness. \nTAYLOR I make the League minimum. \nTom and the others react as if Taylor's just announced a death in the family. \nLYNN He was one of the best in baseball until he had problems with his knees. \nEveryone is somewhat surprised by Lynn's quick defense of Taylor, including Lynn herself. \nTOM What are you going to do when your career ends? I mean you can't play baseball forever, can you? \nTAYLOR Somethin'll come up. \nTOM Will it? \nTAYLOR I don't know, I was thinkin' of goin' to Hawaii, and having a couple of kids who grow up to be Olympic champions. \nJACK Oh really. In what event? \nTAYLOR Swimming. Maybe the two hundred meter Individual Medley. I figure it oughta be big by then. \nJack just nods. He never heard of it. \nBRENT You got the girl picked out? \nTAYLOR I did, but I wasn't smart enough to hold on to her. \nLynn's eyes drop to the floor. \nBRENT You used to be an athlete, didn't you, Lynn? \nLYNN (not wanting to pursue it) Yes. \nBRENT What did you do? \nLYNN (reluctant) Two Hundred Individual medley. \nTAYLOR Alternate on the '80 Olympic Team. \nA tense silence settles on the group. \nTAYLOR Well, I gotta be goin'. Nice to have met you all. \nTaylor exchanges a quick glance with Lynn and heads for the door. \nTOM Let me walk you out. \nTom accompanies Taylor to the door, out of earshot of the others. \nTAYLOR Thanks for the beer. \nTOM Don't mention it. \nTAYLOR I'll let you know if I land a good job. I know you're concerned about it. \nTOM Yeh, well, I just wanted Lynn to know what she would've had ahead of her. \nTom sticks out his hand. The two men shake to keep up appearances for their onlookers across the room. \nTOM Stay away from her. \nTAYLOR (smiling) Suck my dick. \nINT. VAUGHN'S ROOM - DAY \nVaughn and Hayes are watching a soap opera on an old black and white TV. Pepper pops his head in. \nPEPPER Lou wants to see you down at the office, Rick. \nVaughn looks somewhat apprehensively at Hayes. \nSequence omitted from original script. \nVAUGHAN \nVaughn, wearing his new glasses, paces the mound nervously. He goes to the rosin bag, wipes his brow, shakes out his arm. Finally up on the rubber, he gets the sign from Taylor, goes to his stretch, checks the runner and fires to the plate. \nTHE OAKLAND BATTER \nswings and hits a grounder between third and short. Dorn moves to his left, but the ball goes past his glove and into left field. There is some question as to whether Dorn really gave it a full effort. \nDOYLE (V.O.) Bouncing ball, Dorn can't get to it, into left field, base hit. Clarke digging around second, he'll make it to third, and the A's have runners at the corners. \nVaughn stomps around on the mound, obviously upset. He glares at Dorn a beat before getting back on the mound. Dorn's face is non-commital. Brown paces in the dugout. \nPEPPER You want me to go get him? \nBROWN No, he's come this far. Let's see if he can finish it. \nDoyle downs a little more rum and coke in the press box. \nDOYLE Vaughn in a little trouble here, but I'll tell ya, these Cleveland fans are great. Listen to them get behind Vaughn. \nDoyle imitates the sound of a crowd cheering with his own voice, punctuated by whistles and clapping. \nTHE BLEACHER BAND \nThelma calmly knits her blanket with the scores of all the Indians' games stitched into it, the Madame La Farge of Cleveland. The boys, however, are a little restless. \nBOBBY We need some defense here. Maybe we oughta do a wave. \nJOHNNY C'mon, Indians don't do waves. Let's keep this thing pure. \nVIC What harm could it do? \nREXMAN \nThe next Oakland hitter, steps in. Taylor flashes a sign. Vaughn comes to the stretch and delivers. High, ball one. The runner on first goes down to second without a throw, the pitch being too tough to handle. \nDOYLE (V.O.) Runner goes, high, Taylor has no play. The go-ahead and potential winning run is in scoring position. \nTaylor walks out in front of the plate to throw the ball back to Vaughn. \nTAYLOR Forget the runners, Ricky, get this guy at the plate. \nTaylor goes back behind the dish. Vaughn gets up on the rubber. He winds and comes to the plate. Way high this time. \nDOYLE High ball two, and the crowd doesn't like that call one bit. \nDoyle imitates the sound of a crowd booing. Taylor, meanwhile, has gone out to the mound. \nTAYLOR Okay, let's get nasty here, Rick. You know he's lookin' for this pitch. Gotta come up with somethin' studly. \nVAUGHN Fuckin' Dorn. Game shoulda been over by now. Dorn coulda had that ball. He tanked it on purpose. \nTAYLOR This isn't the California Penal League, Vaughn. We're professionals here. We don't tank a play for personal reasons, so cut the crybaby shit. You've pitched a helluva game. You wanna finish it, don't ya? \nVaughn nods. \nTAYLOR Can you give me a strike on this pitch? \nVAUGHN Yeh, but I don't know if there'll be much on it. My arm feels like jello. \nTAYLOR Just make sure it's over the plate. I want him to swing. \nVAUGHN The last time I did that, the guy hit one that hasn't landed yet. \nTAYLOR Don't worry, I'll take care of it. \nTaylor starts back toward the plate, and then stops. \nTAYLOR By the way, I been meaning to ask you. Why'd you steal that car? \nVAUGHN I was bored. \nTAYLOR Next time you might think about takin' in a movie or somethin'. \nVaughn permits himself a little smile and release from the tension. Taylor smiles back, and trots off toward the plate. \nTHE BLEACHER BAND \nBobby and Vic are doing a two-man wave. When one sits down, the other stands up. \nTAYLOR \nhas settled in behind the plate now. He starts talking to the batter, Rexman. \nHarris shouts over from the showers where he's just turned on the water. \nHARRIS Hey, there's no hot water in here. \nBROWN She's at it again. I've had it with this nickel and dime stuff. (storming out of the training room) I'm gonna get the Bitch on the phone. \nBrown is stopped short by the sight of Rachel Phelps standing in the middle of the locker room as various unclad players dive for cover. \nRACHEL You wanted to see the Bitch? \nBROWN Yeh. \nRACHEL Don't you think you oughta cover yourself with a towel first, Mr. Brown? \nBROWN There aren't any towels, and I'm too old to be diving under benches. \nRACHEL Well, I can take it if you can. \nBROWN What happened to the new whirlpool we were supposed to get? \nRACHEL Revenue problems have forced us to cut back on equipment. We'll simply have to fix the old one. \nBROWN You fixed it six times already. And now there's no hot water in the showers. \nRACHEL The pipes in this building are old and rusted. We're replacing them, but it's a long, expensive process. \nBROWN How am I supposed to keep my players healthy with cold water and no therapy equipment? \nRACHEL Your players will just have to get a little tougher. What are they, a bunch of pansies? \nImmediately, 30 arms shoot up behind her in the Italian \"up- yours\" gesture. She turns around, but by then the players have quickly returned to normal positions. \nBROWN Over 162 games even tough guys get sprains, sore arms, muscle pulls... \nRACHEL It's only temporary. Besides, these guys weren't playing that good when the equipment was workin'. If I could get anybody to come and watch this team, none of this would be necessary. You oughta be grateful I can still pay your salaries. \nWith that, Rachel turns and walks out. Brown and the others can only watch her go. \nCUT TO: \nOMIT \nSequence omitted from original script. \nOMIT \nSequence omitted from original script. \nCUT TO: \nSPORTSCASTER ROSS FARMER \nOn the air. \nFARMER In case you haven't noticed, and judging by attendance, you haven't, the Indians, that thought-to-be hopeless collection of has-been's and never-will-be's is actually approaching the .500 mark, and with it, semi-respectability. Nothing to write home about, to be sure, but at least we don't have to cover our eyes. \nINT. THE INJUN DINER - DAY \nBobby, Vic and Johnny are at the counter. \nVIC Ya know, they could be a lot worse. \nINT. PRIVATE GYM - DAY \nThe Business Executive is talking with a friend while working out on the Nautilus machines. \nBUSINESS EXECUTIVE Ya know, I may have underestimated this team a bit. \nEXT. THE CLEVELAND DOCKS - DAY \nThe two Longshoremen again. \nLONGSHOREMAN Ya know, these guys aren't so fuckin' bad. \nEXT. CLEVELAND MUNICIPAL STADIUM - DAY \nThe two Groundskeepers are repairing the pitcher's mound. \nGROUNDSKEEPER (in subtitles) They're still shitty. \nOMIT \nSequence omitted from original script. \nOMIT \nLynn comes up the stairs, unlocks the apartment door and steps inside. There's no particular urgency. She feels sure she's shaken Taylor. \nThe apartment is full of packing boxes. Tired from the chase, Lynn drops her bag on a box and slumps down on the couch. It's obvious she's not all that happy to have lost Taylor. She goes to the window and looks down to the street for some sign of him. \nSeeing nothing, she turns away from the window disappointed, and starts back to the couch, when something stops her. It's Taylor, standing in the doorway. \nTAYLOR Whose place are we at this time? \nLYNN (flustered) Mine. You follow me again? \nTAYLOR Yeh. When I saw you at the game, I figured you wanted to see me about something. \nLYNN I just wanted to see you play. \nTAYLOR How was I? \nLYNN You looked good, but you oughta open your stance a little. They're pitchin' you inside. \nTAYLOR I'll try that. \nTaylor gives a perfunctory nod. They look at each other a second. There's still plenty there. Taylor begins to come toward her. We hear his cleats on the floor. She backs off, but not with real conviction. \nLYNN I think I oughta tell you that I'm moving in with Tom. \nTAYLOR Goin' uptown, huh? \nLYNN I'm not goin' uptown, I just want to lead a regular life. You know, like an adult maybe. With a house and a garden and normal hours. \nTAYLOR You think I can't lead a regular life? \nLYNN You like the life you've had, Jake. You like hangin' out with the boys, livin' in hotels, eatin' dinner at midnight, having girls send you their underwear in the mail. Remember the surprise party I threw for you when you made the All-Star team? You never showed up, but the doorbell rang once and we all got quiet and hid behind the furniture. It was a guy to serve you with a paternity suit. \nTAYLOR That was a hoax. The girl was just trying to get some publicity. \nLYNN Yes, but you had obviously been with her. And it happened in front of all our friends. \nTAYLOR I was drownin', Lynn. The endorsements were dryin' up, my knees were goin', they were talkin' about sendin' me down. I was just trying to hold on to somethin', prove to myself I was still an All-Star. I don't care about that anymore. I know I don't have much time left in baseball. I'm just a guy trying to put his life back together. Thinkin' about you was the only thing that kept me goin' in Mexico. \nLynn looks at him a long beat. \nLYNN I've come back to you too many times, Jake. I can't afford to believe you anymore. \nLynn is backed up against a desk now. She could move out but doesn't. \nTAYLOR I guess this is our last hurrah then. \nLYNN I guess so. Did you really read \"Moby Dick?\" \nTAYLOR Cover to cover. \nTaylor comes forward to kiss her, tentatively at first. Their conversation is interwoven with the slowly deepening intensity of their kissing. \nTAYLOR When's the wedding? \nLYNN October third. \nTAYLOR Your mom and dad like this guy? \nLYNN You're still their favorite. \nThey're unbuttoning each other's shirts now. \nTAYLOR Gonna be a big wedding? \nLYNN Tom doesn't like big weddings. You coulda read Plot Outlines of 101 Great Novels. \nTAYLOR Where? \nLYNN At any library. \nTAYLOR I mean the wedding. \nLYNN All Saints on Euclid. \nTAYLOR Nice church. \nLYNN Yeh. Who saved Ishmael at the end? \nTAYLOR Nobody. It was Queequeg's coffin. Am I invited? \nLYNN Where? \nTAYLOR To the wedding. \nLYNN If you want. Maybe you really did read it. \nHAYES Yeh. \nINT. INDIAN EXPRESS - NIGHT \nThe bus slows down and pulls over to the curb. \nDRIVER This is it. The Sheffield Arms. \nThe players all crowd to the window to get a glimpse of their hotel. Hotel is actually overstating it. This place is one cut below the YMCA. \nBROWN I don't know if we can survive any more of these economy measures. \nINT. THE SHEFFIELD ARMS - DAY \nWe pick up Taylor, Hayes and Vaughn coming into their dilapidated hotel room. Peeling walls and ceilings, rickety furniture, rusted bathroom fixtures. Taylor sprawls down on one of the cots. It collapses on the floor in a cloud of dust. \nEXT. YANKEE STADIUM - DAY \nVaughn is on the mound warming up. \nDOYLE (V.O.) So, Ricky Vaughn, roughed up in his only other appearance against the Yankees, will see what he can do with the Bronx Bombers this time. Vaughn, after a slow start, has come on lately and now leads the American League in strikeouts with 221. \nVaughn finishes his warmups. As Taylor pumps the ball down to second, Vaughn hears a voice from the Yankee dug-out. \nVOICE Hey, jailbird! \nVaughn glances over and sees that one of the Yankees is dressed in a striped prison uniform. He also wears long earrings, high heels, and of course, glasses. Vaughn tries to ignore the guy, but his concentration is broken. \nVaughn steps up on the rubber for his first pitch. He winds and fires. The Yankee LEADOFF HITTER rips a one-hopper to the wall in right center. Hayes runs it down and guns it back to the infield to hold the guy to a double. The convict whoops it up. \nVaughn gets back up on the rubber. As he comes to the stretch, he catches sight of the convict again. The guy is doing a pantomime, sneaking up to a car and picking the lock, much to the delight of his teammates. Vaughn throws his pitch in the dirt and all the way to the backstop. The runner on second goes to third. \nTAYLOR (throwing the ball back) C'mon, Rick baby, settle down. \nVaughn gets ready again. The convict finishes picking the lock and then is suddenly arrested. He puts his hands against the wall and spreads his legs for a weapons check, cracking up the whole bench. Vaughn is getting a little steamed. His next pitch is hammered into left for a single, scoring a run. \nTHREE SHOTS OF VAUGHN \nthrowing pitches, followed by: \nSHOTS \nof the THIRD HITTER lining a double down the right field line, the FOURTH HITTER a triple off the center field wall, and the FIFTH HITTER a single to right. The scoreboard now reads 4 to 0 Yankees. Taylor comes out to talk to Vaughn. \nTAYLOR What's the problem, Rick? You're throwin' basketballs up there. That guy in the dugout botherin' you? \nVAUGHN Naw, I'm all right. \nTAYLOR Forget him. Worry about the guys carryin' bats. C'mon, Ricky, let's get nasty. \nVaughn nods as Taylor trots back behind the plate. \nVaughn gets set again as his old nemesis, Haywood, steps into the batter's box. Haywood has a sly smile on his face. \nAs Vaughn comes to his stretch, the convict goes back into his act. He's in jail now, struggling against the bars. Finally he bends over and grabs his ankles, while one of his teammates humps up against him, pretending to bugger him. This sends the Yankee bench into hysterics. \nVaughn has lost it now. He fires to the plate and Haywood creams another tape measure job into the upper deck. Hayes doesn't even bother to run back to the wall. He just watches it go. 6-0 Yankees. \nBROWN I thought now that Vaughn had some control, he was ready for the Yankees. \nPEPPER Not quite yet. \nBrown makes his way to the mound to take Vaughn out. \nDOYLE (V.O.) So, Vaughn pitches in some tough luck here as the Yankees put together as few squib hits and take a 6-0 lead. \nDOYLE \nin the press box. The stadium below is empty, the grounds crew covering the infield. \nDOYLE Well, the Indians made a gallant comeback today, but fell one run short as the Yankees held on for a 6- 5 victory, although they didn't do squat after the first inning. Anyway, if the bus makes it here from the hotel we'll be on at 7:30 tomorrow night. Till then, this is Harry Doyle, saying so long, everybody, and Happy Hunting. \nINT. THE HOTEL BAR - NIGHT \nBrown is alone in the bar having a drink. A figure sits down on the stool next to him. It's Donovan. \nDONOVAN Mind if I join you? \nBROWN (surprised to see him) Donovan. Hell no. What are you doin' here? \nDONOVAN Just wanted to get out on the road. You damn near pulled one out today. \nBROWN Someday we'll figure out how to beat those guys. \nDONOVAN Ya know, you've done a helluva job this year. \nhitting one rocket-shot ground ball after another at Dorn. Some bounce off his chest and arms, but Dorn stays in front of every one. \nDORN \ntaking off his shirt in the locker room. His chest is a mass of welts and bruises. \nCERRANO \n\"polishing\" his bats with black shoe polish and a brush. \nTAYLOR \ntaking batting practice late at night. He attacks the ball swing after swing. \nOMIT \nSequence omitted from original script. \nVAUGHN \ntaking his stretch with a man on first, and firing to the plate. The Batter swings and misses for strike three, while the Runner on first breaks for second. TAYLOR rifles a throw down to second nailing the Runner for a double play. \nDORN \ntaking a hot smash off his chest. He picks it up and guns the runner down. \nOMIT \nSequence omitted from original script. \nHAYES \nstealing home, as the opposing Pitcher tries frantically to hurry his windup. Hayes slides across safely, hooking to the infield side. He jumps up and punches the air with his fist. \nHAYES \nnailing up the pair of black gloves he used to steal home above his bed. \nNEWSPAPER HEADLINE \n\"INDIANS WIN FIFTH STRAIGHT, CRACK FIRST DIVISION\" \nEXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nRoss Farmer, microphone in hand, stands in front of a blazing bonfire. A large crowd cheers as various people throw doormats on the blaze. \nFARMER (to TV camera) You remember bra burning in the '70's, well, the newest thing in Cleveland is doormat burning as Indian fans are standing up and saying \"We won't be stepped on anymore\". \nTHREE QUICK SHOTS OF VAUGHN \nblowing fast balls by hitter. \nRACHEL \nwith Donovan next to her, watching all this good play in disgust. \nAN ANGEL HITTER \nlining a single to center. Cerrano charges it and fires to the plate as a Runner tries to score from second. Just as Taylor catches the ball, he's once again knocked flat by the Runner. This time he lies still a beat, and then an arm comes up holding the ball. \nThe Umpire thumbs the Runner out. \nTAYLOR \nlate at night, sitting head-down in the outboard motor whirlpool. He's hurting. \nEXT. CLEVELAND DOWNTOWN STREET -DAY \nWe PICK UP three Teenage Girls walking down the street wearing T-shirts that say WILD THING--I THINK I LOVE YOU. A Black Kid comes by wearing black gloves on each hand. As he passes, he holds up one finger signifying Number One. The Girls return the signal. \nEXT. EXECUTIVE'S OFFICE - DAY \nThe Business Executive passes his secretary's desk, gives her some instructions, and goes into his office. As soon as he's out of sight, she opens her drawer and slips the earplug from a portable radio into her ear. OVER, we hear the Indians' BROADCAST. \nTHE EXECUTIVE \ninside his office. He opens his desk drawer and pulls out an earplug. He's also listening to the game. \nOMIT \nSequence omitted from original script. \nOMIT \nSequence omitted from original script. \nlive outside the Indian's locker room. He wears a headdress, warpaint, and a Wild Thing T-shirt. \nFARMER Good evening, everybody. The incredible has happened. The Indians have finished the regular season in a first place tie with the New York Yankees on the strength of a 4-2 win over the Tigers in Detroit today. There will be a one-game playoff here in Cleveland the day after tomorrow to decide the Eastern Division Championship, the Indians having won the coin flip held just moments ago in the American League office. We'll have further details on the news at 11, but for now, get your tomahawks ready, Cleveland. \nCLOSEUP - A PIECE OF LEOPARD SKIN FABRIC \nWe hear cheers as it's ripped away to reveal the photographic image of Rachel's cleavage. We PULL BACK to see the life- size poster is now completely peeled. Rachel stares out at us in a G-string and tassels. The photo is obviously from her showgirl days. \nGeneral merriment prevails in the locker room. Players shaking hands, back slapping, etc. Hayes comes by to exchange congratulations with Taylor. MUSIC and MONTAGE END. \nHAYES Hey, not bad for a has-been and a never-will-be. \nTAYLOR We haven't won anything yet. We still got one more to go. \nDorn comes by Taylor's locker. \nDORN Hey, Taylor, there's a coupla drop- dead Annies outside. One of 'em says she used to know you pretty good. Brunette, great rack... \nTAYLOR Darla. \nDORN Yeh. What doya say we chat 'em up? \nTAYLOR (without much enthusiasm) I don't know... \nDORN C'mon, you're not gonna keep moonin' over that library chick, are you? Forget her, she's gone. \nWe leave Taylor thinking it over. \nINT. DORN'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nSuzanne Dorn is watching the 11 o'clock news. HAL CHARLES is holding forth. \nCHARLES The Indians are spending the night in Detroit and will bus back to Cleveland in the morning. We're going to go back now to Ross Farmer who's standing by at the Hotel Stanley where the Indians are staying in Detroit. Ross? \nThe scene shifts to... \nTHE LOBBY OF THE STANLEY HOTEL \nwhere Ross Farmer stands, microphone in hand. Behind him several players can be seen partying in the bar. \nFARMER Thank you, Hal. As you can see, the Indians are in high spirits tonight, looking forward to their showdown with the Yankees. Who will start that game is still a matter of some conjecture. \nAs Ross talks, Dorn walks INTO THE FRAME in the far background with his arm around a YOUNG LOVELY. They're nuzzling and hugging, unaware they're on camera, albeit in the background. Suzanne doesn't miss it though. She moves closer to the screen to get a better look. \nDorn and the Girl get in an elevator together, obviously going upstairs. As the elevator closes, Suzanne hits the off button. She sits there a second in shock, and then her face begins to harden. \nINT. TAYLOR'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nTaylor and DARLA are undressing, preparatory to getting into bed. They are definitely no strangers to each other. \nDARLA You still got that black Corvette? The one that the sound system took up the whole trunk? \nTAYLOR No, I had to sell it. \nDARLA I thought they gave them to ya. \nTAYLOR Not after your knees go bad. \nDARLA That's all right, you'll be gettin' a new one now. \nDarla is down to her bra and panties. She puts her leg up on the bed to unhook her stockings. Taylor is about to take off his pants, but stops. \nTAYLOR Darla, I don't think I can do this. \nDARLA What do you mean? We did this between innings once. \nTAYLOR I guess I'm just not that guy anymore. \nDarla looks at him a long beat. \nDARLA (resigned) Happens to the best of them sooner or later. What's her name? \nEXT. HALL OUTSIDE TAYLOR'S ROOM - NIGHT \nThe door opens and Darla comes out, fully clothed now. She turns to say goodbye to Jake, who is still bare-chested. \nDARLA So long, Jake. Too bad. I was gonna devote a whole chapter to you in my book. \nAs Darla gives Jake a goodbye peck, the elevator door opens across the hall, and out steps Lynn. She's obviously rattled by the sight of Taylor and Darla together. \nLYNN Excuse me. I was in town for a conference and thought I'd drop by, but I can see you're busy... \nWith that she quickly steps back into the elevator and the doors close. \nTAYLOR Lynn, wait... \nVaughn is sitting on his bed in a state of disbelief. \nVAUGHN I swear to God I didn't know who she was. \nTaylor nods that it's all right even though he doesn't believe it. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nOMIT \nSequence omitted from original script. \nTHE LIMO \npulling up outside the church. Lynn is helped out of the car by her Father. As she starts up the steps, she sees that both sides are lined by the entire Cleveland Indians team in uniform. They form an arch of bats as she passes. At the top of the steps is Taylor. Lynn stops as her father ushers her mother on into the church. \nTAYLOR You look beautiful. \nLYNN Thank you. I didn't think you'd come. \nTAYLOR I can't stay. (indicating the team) We gotta get to the park. \nLYNN Good luck today, Jake. \nTAYLOR Yeh, you too. (pause) Tell me one thing. The night you came up to my hotel -- was there really a library conference? \nLYNN No, I came to see you. \nTAYLOR Too bad it didn't work out better. I just wanna say I'm sorry for all the things I've put you through over the years. \nLYNN Even for last night? \nTAYLOR Can't be sorry for that. Nothing happened. \nHe says this with absolute conviction. Despite herself, Lynn senses that he's telling the truth. \nLYNN Then you weren't defending my honor again? \nTAYLOR I didn't have to. She knew she was outclassed. \nLynn smiles. He gives her a kiss and watches as she goes inside. He stands there a long beat, then turns and walks slowly down the steps past his teammates. \nINT. RACHEL PHELPS' OFFICE - DAY \nRachel is looking out at the empty stadium. There's a KNOCK at the door. \nRACHEL Come in. \nThe door is opened by a Male Secretary and in steps Lou Brown. \nRACHEL Hello, Lou, what can I do for ya? \nLou puts a folded piece of paper on her desk. \nBROWN I wanted to hand in my resignation before you had a chance to fire me. \nRACHEL What do you mean? \nBROWN I know what you been tryin' to do with this team. After the season, I want no part of it. \nRACHEL Well, I knew I could count on Charlie to tell somebody. I was just afraid he might take too long. \nBROWN Why would you want him to tell somebody? \nRACHEL So you'd tell the team, hopefully getting them mad enough to knock themselves out trying to prove they belonged in this league. I think it worked. \nBROWN You tryin' to make me believe you wanted us to win all along? \nRachel nods. \nBROWN Bullshit. What about the plane, the bus, the bad hotels... \nRACHEL We were broke. We couldn't afford anything better. Donald left the team nearly bankrupt. If we'd had another losing season, I would have had to sell the team. I knew we couldn't win with the team we had, so I decided to bring in new players and see how they'd do with the proper motivation. There was never any offer from Miami. I made it all up. \nBROWN Why should I believe any of this? Now that we're winnin' it's easy for you to jump on the bandwagon. \nRACHEL If I'd really wanted you to lose, all I had to do was send the best players back to the minors. But I didn't, did I? \nBrown has no comeback for this. He knows now that she's telling the truth. \nRACHEL You think this was all an accident? I personally scouted every member of this team, except Hayes, of course. He was a surprise. They all had flaws which concealed their real talent, or I wouldn't have been able to get them. But I knew if anyone could straighten them out, you could. And if you tell them any of this, I will fire you. \nBrown can only shake his head at this whole thing. \nRACHEL I love this team, Lou. Go get 'em tonight. \nThrowing the first pitch. The YANKEE HITTER grounds one to Dorn who throws him out. \nTHE SCOREBOARD \n0-0 in the 3rd. \nCERRANO \nstriking out on a curve ball. \nHAYES \nrobbing a Yankee of a home run by making a leaping catch over the fence. \nTAYLOR \npicking a Yankee runner off first. \nTHE SCOREBOARD \n0-0 in the 5th. \nOMIT \nSequence omitted from original script. \nCERRANO \nstriking out on a curve ball, trying to check his swing. Umpire emphatically punches him out. \nDOYLE \nLooking past him to the field. Harris is on the mound. There's a runner on second. \nDOYLE Still nothing -- nothing, top of the seventh, two down. Harris has been in trouble all night, but has battled his way out with the help of some great defensive plays. \nHarris comes set and delivers. The Yankee hitter, BURTON, (L) swings and gets all of it. \nDOYLE (V.O.) Uh oh, this one's tagged. Deep center field. Way back. Way back. \nHayes climbs up on the wall, but it's long gone. Home run. \nDOYLE (V.O.) It's off the reservation, home run. And the Yankees lead it 2-0. \nRACHEL'S BOX (INSERT STORYBOARD # 209G) \nRACHEL Shit. \nDonovan is a little confused by this. \nBurton trots around the bases and is greeted by jubilant teammates at the plate. A silent pall falls on the stadium. As the \"2\" goes up on the scoreboard, we... \nCUT TO: \nHAYES \npopping up and flinging his bat away in frustration. We take CUTS of the worried fans, chewing fingernails, wadding up programs, hanging their heads, etc. \nTAYLOR \ngrounding out, obviously having trouble running. We take CUTS of worried faces on the bench. \nDORN \nstepping into the batter's box. The crowd is practically sitting on its hands now. Hope draining away. \nDOYLE (V.O.) Dorn up now, two down, bottom of the seventh. The Indians running out of chances. \nDorn swings at the first pitch and lines a sharp single to left. The crowd and the Indian bench suddenly come alive. Cerrano moves to the plate. \nDOYLE (V.O.) That'll bring on Cerrano, hitless tonight. As a matter of fact, he hasn't touched the ball yet. \nThe crowd and bleacher band begins to clap as Dorn takes his lead. Cerrano swings at the first pitch and misses. An audible groan goes through the crowd. \nThe Yankee pitcher gets set again, and throws Cerrano a big, roundhouse curve. He misses it a foot. Strike two. \nBROWN Damn, havin' trouble with the curve ball again. \nHAYES We should've gotten him a live chicken. \nCerrano steps out and begins to talk to his bat, gesturing and pointing as if arguing with his wife. \nCERRANO I pissed off now, Jo-Buu. I good to you, I stand up for you. If you no help me now, I say fuck you, Jo-Buu. I do it myself. \nCerrano gets back in the box and digs in. The Yankee pitcher comes to his stretch and delivers. Another big breaking curve ball. Cerrano swings and knocks the crap out of it. Everyone in the stands and on the bench jumps to their feet, rooting for the ball to get out. \nTAYLOR All right, Ricky, let's get nasty. \nVaughn winds and delivers a hissing blur toward the plate. Haywood takes a ferocious swing and misses. Strike one. \nWe see the number 97 come up on the digital readout of the SPEED GUN which a club employee holds behind the screen. \nTAYLOR (to Haywood) All right, looks like the boy is pumped. Sucker was movin', wasn't it? Ever hit ya, it'd leave a two foot hole comin' out. \nTaylor gets ready to flash another sign. The convict jumps up and down trying to distract Vaughn. No way. \nTAYLOR (for Haywood's ears) Let's see, what should we call now. Let's see how he feels about old number one. \nTaylor puts down one finger. Vaughn nods and then winds and fires again, another blazing rocket. Haywood takes a wicked rip, but doesn't get it. Strike two. 99 comes up on the gun. The convict has stopped jumpin'. \nTAYLOR Nice swing, Haywood. Good follow- through. Keep it up, I'll show you the ball sometime. \nThe fans are going wild. They're all standing now, yelling for a strikeout. Vaughn gets back up on the rubber with the look of an animal sighting prey. Taylor gets down to give the sign. \nDUGOUT (INSERT STORYBOARD # 216R) \nBROWN Forget the curveball. Go with the heater. \nTAYLOR Well, shit, all these pitches to choose from. Maybe we'll try somethin' different this time. \nTaylor wiggles his fingers around and then puts down the big No. 1. Vaughn gives him a quick nod. \nTAYLOR And if I don't see you again, Haywood, have a nice winter. Okay, buddy? \nVaughn goes into his windup and unleashes a screaming bullet toward the plate. Haywood pulls the trigger, but it's already by him. Strike three. 101 on the gun. Taylor leaps up and gives Vaughn the fist. The fans are going berserk. MUSIC ends. \nDOYLE (V.O.) Oh, Lordy, three straight heaters and the Yankees are blown down. No runs, two hits, three left on, and, are you ready, Cleveland? We go to the bottom of the ninth, still tied at two. \nDoyle turns the mike off. \nDOYLE (to his color man) Can you believe this, Monty? \nMonty takes a big swig straight from the bourbon bottle. \nOMIT \nSequence omitted from original script. \nANOTHER INDIAN HITTER \ngrounding out to short. \nHAYES \nwalking up to the plate. \nDOYLE (V.O.) Two down in the ninth, Hayes steps in hitting .291, trying to get something going for the Tribe. \nTaylor and the others yell encouragement to Hayes as he digs in at the plate. The Yankee pitcher delivers and Hayes hits a high bouncer toward short. The shortstop waits for it to come down and then fires to first. Too late. Hayes streaks across the bag, beating the throw by a hair. Once again the CROWD comes to life. \nThe Yankee Manager comes to the mound and waves for a new pitcher. \nDOYLE (V.O.) And Horton is wasting no time. He's goin' to the Duke. \nOut of the pen comes BILLY DUKE, a good facsimile of Goose Gossage only Duke is bigger and meaner. \n(INSERT STORYBOARD #219M) \nDOYLE Duke leads the league in saves, strikeouts per inning and nose hairs. \nThe Duke finishes his warmups and stares over at Hayes. Hayes smiles, snaps his black gloves out of his hip pocket, and carefully pulls them on over his hands. \nThe Duke does not care for this kind of showmanship. \nBrown comes over to talk to Taylor, who's been watching Duke from the on-deck circle. \nBROWN Ya know I'd be an ass not to pinch- hit for you here. You're 0 for 18 against Duke. Plus you're beat to shit you can hardly walk, there's no way you can get around on this guy's fast ball. So I want the absolute truth here. Can you beat this guy? \nTAYLOR Yeh. \nBROWN Okay. \nTaylor starts for the plate, as Duke finishes his warmups. Brown comes down the dugout steps. \nBROWN (to Pepper) Send Hayes the first pitch. I don't want Taylor takin' too many strikes. \nPepper begins flashing signs out to Hayes. Duke gets up on the rubber and takes his stretch. Hayes leads away, crouching low. Duke snaps a throw over to first, the first baseman slapping a hard tag on Hayes, but Hayes is back. \nThe crowd is on its feet again. The \"GO\" chant starts, punctuated by thousands of black-gloved hands punching the night air. \nDuke comes set again. Hayes leads away. Duke watches him, checks him again. We go to SLOW MOTION as Duke kicks and comes to the plate. \n", "test1_input": "VAUGHN What is that stuff? \nHARRIS (pointing to them in order) Crisco, Bardahl, Vagisil. Any one of 'em will give you another 2-3 inches drop on your curve ball. \nVaughn can't believe this. \nHARRIS Course if it's cold and I got a shirt on under my jersey, I just rub a little jalapeno inside my nose and get it runnin'. I need to load up the ball a little, I just wipe my nose. \nVAUGHN (revolted) You put snot on the ball? \nHARRIS At my age, you put anything you can find on it. I haven't got an arm like yours. \nVaughn just looks at him incredulous. \nTAYLOR AND CARRANO \nTaylor is undressing, but his attention is diverted by Cerrano whose stall is right next to him. Cerrano has set up an altar in his locker. In front of his bats, which are lined up like sentinels, is a table covered with pictures of baseball players, figurines of saints, several lit candles and, in the middle, a primitive fetish doll with a cigar in its mouth. \nCerrano has drawn some magic signs on his bats. He finishes an incantation and then lights the cigar on the fetish doll. \nTAYLOR What are you doin' there, Pedro? \nCERRANO Bats. They are sick. \nTAYLOR So are mine. Is somethin' goin' around? \nCERRANO No hit curve ball. Straight ball, hit it very much. Curve ball, bats are afraid. I ask Jo-Buu to come. Take fear from bats. \nHAYES Jo-Buu? \nTAYLOR Maybe he's the pagan saint of baseball. \nCERRANO I offer him cigars and gin. He will come. \nCerrano pours some gin in a small cup and puts it next to the fetish doll. Harris has been listening to all this. Cerrano grabs a towel to head for the showers. \nHARRIS I wouldn't leave this gin sittin' around out here with this group. \nCERRANO (with a certain gravity) Is very bad to steal Jo-Buu's gin. Is very bad. \nCerrano closes his locker and goes off to the showers, leaving everyone to wonder just how bad. \nOMIT \nSequence omitted from original script. \nMONTAGE SEQUENCE \ncompressing and detailing the progress of spring training. We see: \nA) Vaughn on the pitcher's mound. A tin replica of a batter has been set up at home plate and rope stretched across the plate to delineate the strike zone. Vaughn fires a pitch and hits the tin batter in the hip, leaving a dent in him. \nB) Cerrano in the batting cage, flailing away in futility at several curve balls. \nC) HAYES \ndoing push-ups at night. He's the only one left on the field, except Temple, who supervises. \nD) TAYLOR \ndoing the \"scramble\" drill -- blocking down balls purposely thrown in the dirt, one after another. When it ends, he can hardly get to his feet. \nE) CERRANO \nwaving a ten-foot BOA CONSTRICTOR in the sign of the cross in front of his locker before opening it. No red tag greets him. Hayes watches from a safe distance. \nF) VAUGHN \nholding a mirror under the vents on his locker door to get a peek inside to see if there's a red tag there. \nG) DORN \ntaking a hard ground ball off the chest. Brown applauds. Dorn is pissed. \nH) VAUGHN \nthrowing at the \"ropes\" again. The tin batter is dented in every conceivable place now. Vaughn whips in another fast ball. This one hits the tin man in the head, knocking it completely off. \nI) TAYLOR \nin an exhibition game, attempting to throw out a base stealer. Jake springs out of his crouch and fires down to second -- on a bounce. The ball skips into center field. \nJ) HAYES \nalso in an exhibition game, swinging at a pitch and popping it up behind the plate. He just drops in his tracks and starts to do push-ups as the catcher makes the catch behind him. \n", "test1_true": "flailing away again at a curve ball. This and the remaining shots are all in exhibition games. \nL) HAYES \nwaving a ten-inch garter snake in front of his locker. Even at this size we can tell it scares the hell out of him, but it works its magic. No red tag. \nM) VAUGHN \nwith a runner on third, winding up and throwing a pitch four feet over Taylor's head. The run scores. \nN) HAYES \nattempting to steal second. He goes into a hell-bent-for- leather head first slide. Unfortunately, he comes up two feet short of the base. The second baseman, who's waiting for him with the ball, makes a motion for him to keep coming. Hayes flips him the bird. \nO) LOU BROWN \non the bench. He turns to Pepper with a look that says, \"Can you believe this shit?\" \nP) TAYLOR \nwaiting for a throw at the plate. Just as he's about to catch it, the runner knocks him flat. \nQ) BROWN \nhis head in his hands. As Taylor gets up and goes to the wrong dugout, the MONTAGE ENDS. \nEXT. INDIANS' PRACTICE FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON \nPlayers are filing off the team bus after the game. We PICK UP Taylor, Hayes and Vaughn as they head toward the locker room. \nVAUGHN This is final cut down day, right? \nTAYLOR Yeh, better get your snake ready, Hayes. \nHAYES No, I'm goin' cold turkey today. My hands are too screwed up to hold it anyway. \nHayes reveals a pair of red and cut hands. \nTAYLOR If you're gonna use that head first slide, you better get yourself some gloves or you're not gonna have any skin left on your hands. \nThey've reached the locker room now. \nVAUGHN I don't wanna go in there. \nTAYLOR Whatever happens, keep it to yourself until you're outta the locker room. Don't celebrate in front of guys who just died. \nHAYES What if we're one of the deceased? \nTaylor goes into the locker room. Hayes and Vaughn hang back. \nCerrano is already at his locker. He's got two snakes this time and some kind of voodoo head dress on. He sprays a patch of white paint on the locker door from a spray can, draws a symbol door. No tag. He kisses the snake, leaving some white paint on his lips, like a kid who's just had a glass of milk. \nTaylor, exhausted from the game, lifts his latch and peers inside. He's made it, too. Cerrano offers a hand. Taylor shakes it and breaks a weary smile. \nGENTRY \nopens locker, slumps on stool. He's a goner. \nHAYES AND VAUGHN \nthe two rookies, are still hanging back. \nHAYES C'mon, Vaughn, let's show some nuts here. If they cut us, we'll just sign with the Yankees. \nHayes strides manfully to his locker and pulls it open. This doesn't tell him much, however, because he's got his eyes closed. He stands that way a beat ot two, then opens one eye. \nSeeing no tag, he turns and walks double-time out of the locker room, as if he had to get to the john. \nHe comes outside, turns a corner, and starts leaping around like a wild man. \nVAUGHN \ndrawing strength from Hayes, walks resolutely to his locker and whips it open. There hanging from the top hook is the \"red death.\" Vaughn stares at it expressionless, then slowly closes his locker. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BROWN'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON \nVaughn goes right in without knocking and leans on Brown's desk. \nVAUGHN I got news for you, Mr. Brown. You haven't heard the last of me. You think I'm shit now, but someday you'll be sorry you cut me. I'm gonna catch on somewhere else, and every time I pitch against you, I'm gonna stick it up your ass. \nBROWN Good, I like that kinda spirit in a player. The only problem is, I didn't cut you. \n", "test1_id": 2721, "test2_input": "TAYLOR The number, Lynn... \nLYNN (reluctant) All right. 555-9314. \nTAYLOR Thank you. I'm back, Lynn, and I'm gonna be around. \nShe looks at him a beat, unsure what to say, then heads back toward her table. We go to Lynn's date. None of this has been lost on him. \nINT. TAXI - DAY \nTaylor, Hayes and Vaughn are the fares. \nCABBIE What's the number again? \nTAYLOR (looking at a piece of paper) \nHAYES What is this place? \nTAYLOR Furnished apartment building owned by the Indians. We get special rates. With what we're makin' we'll need it. \nThe Cabbie pulls to a stop and points to the other side of the street. \nCABBIE That's it. \nTaylor and the others turn to see a dismal, run-down building with a neon sign that says \"The Turk.\" \nTAYLOR Welcome to the Big Leagues. \nINT. THE TURK - DAY \nJake goes to a pay phone in the hall and dials the number Lynn gave him. \nVOICE ON PHONE Hello, Cuyahoga Sheet Metal. \nTaylor doesn't like the sound of this. \nTAYLOR You got anybody workin' there named Lynn Wells? \nVOICE ON PHONE Never heard of her. \nTAYLOR Didn't think so. \nTaylor hangs up, staring off into space. \nINT. THE INDIANS' LOCKER ROOM - DAY \nVarious players are dressing out for the game. We PICK UP Cerrano putting on his undergarments. They're all black, including his jock. Dorn reads the Wall Street Journal, while Taylor sits on the trainer's table getting his knees taped. \nHayes checks the fit of his new uniform from every angle in a mirror. He thinks he looks pretty good. Vaughn just squeezes a baseball in his left hand, obviously a little uptight. Taylor gives him a chuck on the shoulder. \nTAYLOR Take it easy. We got 162 of these to go. \nLou Brown enters the locker room. \nBROWN All right, let's gather 'round. \nThe players turn their attention to Brown. \nBROWN I'm not much for inspirational addresses. I just wanta point out that every newspaper in the country has picked us to finish last. The local press thinks we'd save everybody a lot of time and trouble if we just went out and shot ourselves. Me, I like to waste sportswriters' time so I'm for hangin' around and seein' if we can give all these guys a nice big shitburger to eat. \nCheers all around. \nHARRIS Aren't we gonna have a prayer? I mean we're not all savages like Cerrano. \nBROWN You guys go ahead. I belong to the church of three-run homers. \nHARRIS All right, let's bow our heads. \nMany of the players follow suit. Suddenly the silence is shattered by a loud explosive SOUND, scaring the hell out of everybody. All eyes turn to Cerrano, who has just set off a charge of gunpowder on his locker altar. \nCERRANO Have to wake up bats. \nDisgusted, Harris and the others turn back to their prayers. \nHARRIS Dear Lord, we ask... \nHarris never gets to finish. The smoke rising from Cerrano's gunpowder explosion sets off the automatic sprinklers in the ceiling. As Harris and the faithful look up into the downpour, we... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MUNICIPAL STADIUM - DAY \nThe stands are nearly empty. Of the fans who have showed up, many wear doormats around their necks. \nBobby, Vic, Johnny and Thelma, our four fans from the diner, sit alone in the vast expanse of the centerfield bleachers. All four wear Indian head dresses and have war paint on their faces. The three men each have tom-toms. Thelma works on her needlepoint. \n", "test2_true": "THELMA Everybody laughs at the Indians now, but there were other times. Even won the Series in '48. Then Willie Mays made that catch on Vic Wertz in the '54 Series and Cleveland's never been the same since. \nJOHNNY As the Indians go so goes Cleveland, huh? \nTHELMA If we ever lost the Indians, Cleveland would die. \nINT. MUNICIPAL STADIUM PRESS BOX - DAY \nWe get our fist glimpse of HARRY DOYLE, the Indians' 55-year- old radio announcer. Harry's never walked past a bar in anger. He's been with the Indians through thin and thinner. \nDOYLE (on the air) Hello, everybody, Harry Doyle here, welcoming all you Friends of the Feather to another season of Indians baseball. (pouring some Jack Daniels in his Coke) A lotta new faces for the tribe this year, as they take on the defending American League champs, the New York Yankees. And listen to the roar of the crowd as the Indians takes the field! \nDoyle leans out the press box window with his mike, trying to pick up the sound of a couple guys CLAPPING down below. \nDOYLE Yes, sir, they love this club here in Cleveland. \nDoyle takes a hit of his spiked Coke. \nDOWN ON THE FIELD \nA YANKEE HITTER \nflies out to Hayes, who makes a \"basket\" catch a la Willie Mays. \nDOYLE (V.O.) High fly ball, centerfield. Hayes under it now... Oh, makes a basket catch, Willie Mays style, and the side is retired. \nTHE INDIAN DUGOUT \nThe team comes in off the field to much enthusiasm and back- slapping. \nBROWN All right, way to look, way to look. Nice catch, Hayes. Don't ever fuckin' do it again. Okay, let's get it goin'! \nDOYLE IN THE PRESS BOX \nDOYLE Bottom of the first, Willie Mays Hayes to lead it off for the tribe. \nHAYES \ngoing through his warmup routine at the plate. \nDOYLE (V.O.) A lotta people say you can tell how a season's gonna go by the first hitter of the year. In the last fifteen years, the Indians have never had the season lead-off hitter reach base. \nHayes is in the batter's box now. The Yankee pitcher winds and fires. Hayes swings and hits a little dribbler toward the second baseman, who races in and scoops it up bare-handed. \nDOYLE (V.O.) Hot shot toward the hole. Rudia knocks it down, gets up, fires to first. Too late! Hayes beats it! \nDoyle leans out the window again trying to pick up some cheering. \nDOYLE And so the string is broken. Maybe things will turn around a little for the Indians this year. \nTHE BLEACHERS \nOur four fans (from here on known as the Bleacher Band), overjoyed by Hayes' hit, start beating the tom-toms and singing a fight song they've composed called \"In the Land Of Burning Waters\" to the tune of the old Hamms Beer jingle. \nBLEACHER BAND In the land of burning waters, waters Lurks the Injun nine, oh so fine, we Love those mighty Redmen, Turn their foes to dead men, Ummmmm. \nFIRST BASE AREA \nas Hayes comes back to the bag, where the Yankee FIRST BASEMAN is waiting for him. \nFIRST BASEMAN Showed some real power on that one, Slugger. \nHAYES I plan to get at least a double out of it. \nHayes reaches in his back pocket and pulls out one of the pairs of black leather gloves he bought earlier. \nDOYLE (V.O.) And now Hayes is putting on a pair of black gloves, sending a little message to the Yankees. \nHAYES (to the First Baseman) Bought a hundred of these, one for each base I plan to steal. Excuse me, here, I gotta take my first step toward the Hall of Fame. \nHayes takes his lead-off and crouches, ready to steal. \nFIRST BASEMAN You look real sharp, but you'll never steal second with your shoe untied. \nHayes looks down at his shoe. It's not untied. He notices too late that the PITCHER is throwing over to pick him off. \nDOYLE (V.O.) Brewster, quick move to first... \nHayes dives back for the bag, but never gets there; his face smashing up against the First Baseman's glove, which is already holding the ball. \nDOYLE (V.O.) He got him. Hayes is picked off. \nFIRST BASEMAN Nice base running, dildo. Hard to get your thumb out of your ass with the gloves on. \n", "test2_id": 2722, "test3_input": "Dorn and Harris are at one table; Taylor and Vaughn at one across the way. \nHARRIS Who you got lined up tonight? \nDORN Where are we? Kansas City, right? Gotta be Arlene \nHARRIS You call her? \nDORN Don't have to. She knows when I'm in town. \nTAYLOR AND VAUGHN \nTAYLOR I'm about ready to turn in. I've anesthetized my knees enough. \nA GUY from the bar approaches the table. \nGUY Excuse me, Mr. Vaughn, can I have your autograph? \nVAUGHN Ah... yeh... sure. (signing) My first autograph. I couldn't give these away a couple weeks ago. \nGUY I saw your record on the news. You made their Hall of Shame. Congratulations. \nVAUGHN (embarrassed) Thanks. \nTAYLOR You're a celebrity now, Vaughn. \nVAUGHN I thought you had to do somethin' good to be a celebrity. \nTAYLOR Not if you do it colorfully. \nDORN AND HARRIS \nDORN (pointing to the door) What'd I tell ya. \nWe GO TO the door to find ARLENE standing with two friends, RENE and VICKI. ARLENE is a looker alright, 27, and seriously built. She cases the room, spies Dorn and comes over to his table. \nARLENE Hi, Rodger. This is Vicki and Rene. \nDORN Hi, doll. This is Steve Harris. \nARLENE Where's your buddy Gant? \nDORN (indicating Vaughn) They cut him to make room for bristle boy over there. \nARLENE (looking over at Vaughn) Is that Vaughn, the guy they call Wild Thing? \nDORN (in disgust) Yeh. \nARLENE He's kinda cute. They say he could be a big star. \nDORN What are you talkin' about? He couldn't find the plate if it was magnetized. He won't last the year. \nARLENE He struck out five in a row before the wild pitches. (taking her leave) Maybe I'll check him out. \nDORN (grabbing her) Wait a minute, you're with me. \nTaylor watches this exchange from across the room. \nARLENE I don't remember you makin' any date. \nDORN Since when do I have to make a date? Who's been showin' you this town the last three years? \nARLENE Ancient history, Rodger. I gotta look out for myself now. I don't have to be a slave to no .235 hitter. \nARLENE pulls away and heads for the jukebox as Dorn seethes. She punches a button and we hear X's version of \"WILD THING.\" \nARLENE sashays right up to Vaughn in time with the music. \nARLENE Wild Thing, you make my heart sing. \nARLENE knows how to make the big entrance. Vaughn's slightly overwhelmed. \nDORN \ntaking this all in from across the room. Taylor comes up next to him. \nTAYLOR Guess we're over with, eh, Dorn? \nDORN Speak for yourself, Taylor. I got a couple good years left. \nINT. THE INDIANS' DC-3 - NIGHT \nWe PICK UP Taylor in his seat, glasses on, reading something by the light of a flashlight rigged up to the back of his seat. We MOVE to reveal it -- the Classics Illustrated comic book of \"Moby Dick.\" \nHayes wanders by, an air-sick bag hanging around his neck. \n", "test3_true": "TAYLOR It's one of the masterpieces of American literature, that's all. \nHAYES Lynn put you on to this? \nTAYLOR Long time ago. \nHAYES Well, we're goin' to a club tonight. You wanna come along? \nTAYLOR No, I got some more reading to do. \nTaylor indicates a stack of Classic Comics next to him. \nHAYES What, you got a test or somethin'? Why don't you just go over and see her? Maybe she'll let you slide on a couple of these. \nTAYLOR I might if I knew where she lives. \nHAYES Easy. Tail her home from the library. \nTAYLOR You mean sit in a car and wait for her to come out? That's kinda juvenile, don't you think? \nHAYES (as if that had anything to do with it) Yeh. \nEXT. CLEVELAND LIBRARY - LATE AFTERNOON \nTaylor sits in his car, across the street from the employee entrance of the library. He scrunches down a bit as Lynn comes out of the building and heads for her car. She gets in and we... \nCUT TO: \nSERIES OF SHOTS OF LYNN \ndriving through the city with Taylor following at a discrete distance. Finally, Lynn pulls up outside an expensive-looking townhouse. Taylor pulls up further down the street and watches her go inside, debating whether to go in after her. \nINT. CLEVELAND BAR - EARLY EVENING \nTaylor's having a beer, still trying to decide whether to go see her or not. \nTAYLOR \npulling up outside the townhouse he saw Lynn go into. He goes up the stairs and knocks on the door. \nLynn answers, looking more dressed up than when she left the library. She's surprised to see Taylor. \nTAYLOR Look, Lynn, I'm sorry I followed you home but I wanna... \nLYNN (hurried) This isn't my place... \nTAYLOR Whose place is it? \nBefore Lynn can answer, Tom appears at the door. \nTOM Who's there, love? (spying Taylor) Oh, Mr. Taylor, right? (pointedly) I remember you from the restaurant. Lynn's told me a lot about you. Why don't you come in for a while? \nTAYLOR Nah, that's o.k., I got some things to do... \nLYNN Yeh, he's gotta be goin'... \nTOM No, really, come on in for a drink. \nBefore Taylor can beg off further, Tom ushers him inside and closes the door. In the room are two other couples: ARTHUR HOLLOWAY, a senior partner in Tom's firm and his wife CLAIRE, and BRENT BOWDEN, another lawyer in the firm and a contemporary of Tom's. His wife is JANICE. This is a very upscale group. \nTOM Excuse me, everybody, this is Jake Taylor. (making the intros) Jake, Arthur and Claire Holloway Brent and Janice Bowden. Jake is a professional baseball player. \nPolite nods from the group, except for Janice, who seems somewhat intrigued. \nTOM So, Jake, what brings you here this evening? \nTAYLOR I, ah, just had a couple books I wanted to discuss with Lynn. I thought this was her place. \nTOM Well, it soon will be. \nTAYLOR Yeh, I heard you guys were engaged. Congratulations. \nTaylor sticks out his hand. Tom's not sure whether Taylor's putting him on or not. He shakes anyway. \nTOM Thank you.

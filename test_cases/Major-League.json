He has six Coke bottles filled with sand strapped to his ankles. He lifts his legs up and down to strengthen his muscles. \nOMIT \nSequence omitted from original script. \nEXT. INDIANS' TRAINING CAMP PRACTICE FIELD - DAY \nDonovan, Brown and two of his coaches, PEPPER LEACH (pitching) and DUKE TEMPLE (hitting) are on the field, witnessing the arrival of their \"troops.\" First to arrive is: \nTAYLOR \nHe gets out of a taxi and goes to the trunk to get his bats and luggage. \nDONOVAN This looks like Jake Taylor. \nBrown turns around from a conversation with Temple. \nBROWN He was an Allstar in Boston, wasn't he? \nDONOVAN Yeh. \nPEPPER Wish we had him two years ago. \nDONOVAN We did. \nPEPPER Four years ago then. \nINT. PLAYER'S BARRACKS - DAY \nLike an Army barracks. Rows of bunk beds seperated by lockers. Taylor walks in with Temple, the hitting instructor. \nTAYLOR What happened to the private rooms? \nTEMPLE We're on an austerity program. This is what happens when you finish 24 games out. \nBROWN, PEPPER, TEMPLE AND DONOVAN \nback at the field, supervising the arrival of more players. \nThe first is a tall, muscular Latin, PEDRO CERRANO, dressed in black from head to toe. He arrives on foot, carrying a black suitcase and pulling a black bat case on wheels. He looks like a gunfighter coming into Dodge. \nBROWN Who's that? \nDONOVAN I think it's Cerrano. Defected from Cuba. Wanted religious freedom. \nBROWN What's his religion? \nDONOVAN Voodoo. \nBLACK AND TAN ROLLS-ROYCE \npulling into the parking lot. Out steps RODGER DORN, high- priced third baseman. Brown eyes him with vague disapproval. \nBROWN Thought you didn't have any high- priced talent. \nDONOVAN (sheepish) I forgot about Dorn, 'cause he's only high-priced. Got him as a free agent three years ago. \nBROWN Still hits the ball pretty well, doesn't he? \nDONOVAN Yeh, he just can't field it. \nDorn pulls his golf clubs out of the car. \nBROWN We'll shape him up. \nWILLIE HAYES \na 22-year-old black, pulling up in a '72 VW Beetle which he's got a Cadillac grille on. He steps out in his shades and sharkskin suit. \nDONOVAN Don't recognize this guy. \nHayes strolls up and introduces himself. \nHAYES Say hey, Willie Mays Hayes here. I play like Mays and run like Hayes. \nBROWN Lou Brown. Nice to meet ya, Hayes. \nHAYES Thanks. Well, I gotta get my stuff... \nHayes hustles off toward his car. \n", "test1_true": "A motorcycle pulls to a stop in the lot, diverting everyone's attention from Hayes. \nOff steps Ricky Vaughn, a hefty bag over his shoulder. He's still sporting his radical do. \nPEPPER Look at this fuckin' guy. \nTEMPLE Maybe he's the mascot. \nDonovan is speechless. Brown breaks into a small smile. Yes, sir, this is his kinda team. \nINT. PLAYERS' BARRACKS \nTaylor is putting his stuff away in a locker. Vaughn enters the barracks and immediately draws the attention of Dorn. \nDORN Hey, what do we have here? Guy looks like a fuckin' toilet brush. Hey, T.B., I love your pony tail. And the earring's cute too. Where's the matching bracelet? \nVaughn whips a hard glance at Dorn, but keeps on walking, making his way along the bunks looking for his assigned bed. It's the one above Taylor. Vaughn unloads his duffel bag in silence. \nTAYLOR (offering his hand) Jake Taylor. \nVaughn shakes it and nods. Says nothing. \nTAYLOR So, you just gonna settle for toilet brush, or you got another name? \nVAUGHN Vaughn. Rick Vaughn. \nTAYLOR Forget about Dorn. He's always a little tough on rookies. You'll get a lot worse from other teams. \nThe conversation is interrupted by the arrival of Hayes. \nHAYES Say hey! How ya doin'? Willie Mays Hayes here. \nTAYLOR Jake Taylor. (pointing to Vaughn) Rick Vaughn. \nHayes doesn't quite know what to make of Vaughn. \nHAYES What the hell league you been playin' in? \nVAUGHN California Penal. \nHAYES Never heard of it. How'd you wind up playin' there? \nVAUGHN I stole a car. \nOn Hayes' look, we... \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE BARRACKS - NIGHT \nIt's dark. Everyone's asleep. Three SECURITY GUARDS with flashlights come down to the top bunk where Hayes is sleeping. \nGUARD This guy wasn't invited to camp. \nThey lift the bunk out of its slots and carry it out the door, Hayes still asleep on it. \nINT. LOCKER ROOM - MORNING \nThe players are dressing out in their uniforms for the first day of practice. Vaughn goes in his locker and finds that a slit has been cut in the back of his cap to accommodate his pigtail. Suppressed laughs are heard from several corners of the locker room. \nINT. CLUBHOUSE - MORNING \nBrown is addressing his troops before the first workout. \nBROWN Welcome to Spring Training, gentlemen. Most managers tell you at this time that all the jobs are open, that nobody's a lock at any position, and that talent isn't everything. They'd rather see desire and discipline in a player. Then they tell you that most of all they want you to have fun out there, even though they're gonna work your ass off on fundamentals and condition you till you drop. The difference between me and those other managers is... (pause) I mean it. \nOn a locker room full of uneasy faces, we... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. PRACTICE FIELD PARKING LOT - MORNING \nHayes' cot is sitting in the lot, just outside the fence, his suitcase set down next to it. Hayes is still asleep, dew on his forehead. Wakened by the noise of activity on the field, he sits up with a start. \nHAYES Shit, I been cut already? \nTHE PRACTICE FIELD \nWe pick up Taylor sprinting his ass off in a 100-yard time trial, staggering across the finish line 10 feet behind Cerrano. \nPEPPER (checking stopwatch) 11.9 Taylor. Not bad if you'd fallen down. \nAs Taylor tries to catch his breath, Dorn and a relief pitcher named Gant approach the starting line for the next trial. \n", "test1_id": 2721, "test2_input": "TAYLOR The number, Lynn... \nLYNN (reluctant) All right. 555-9314. \nTAYLOR Thank you. I'm back, Lynn, and I'm gonna be around. \nShe looks at him a beat, unsure what to say, then heads back toward her table. We go to Lynn's date. None of this has been lost on him. \nINT. TAXI - DAY \nTaylor, Hayes and Vaughn are the fares. \nCABBIE What's the number again? \nTAYLOR (looking at a piece of paper) \nHAYES What is this place? \nTAYLOR Furnished apartment building owned by the Indians. We get special rates. With what we're makin' we'll need it. \nThe Cabbie pulls to a stop and points to the other side of the street. \nCABBIE That's it. \nTaylor and the others turn to see a dismal, run-down building with a neon sign that says \"The Turk.\" \nTAYLOR Welcome to the Big Leagues. \nINT. THE TURK - DAY \nJake goes to a pay phone in the hall and dials the number Lynn gave him. \nVOICE ON PHONE Hello, Cuyahoga Sheet Metal. \nTaylor doesn't like the sound of this. \nTAYLOR You got anybody workin' there named Lynn Wells? \nVOICE ON PHONE Never heard of her. \nTAYLOR Didn't think so. \nTaylor hangs up, staring off into space. \nINT. THE INDIANS' LOCKER ROOM - DAY \nVarious players are dressing out for the game. We PICK UP Cerrano putting on his undergarments. They're all black, including his jock. Dorn reads the Wall Street Journal, while Taylor sits on the trainer's table getting his knees taped. \nHayes checks the fit of his new uniform from every angle in a mirror. He thinks he looks pretty good. Vaughn just squeezes a baseball in his left hand, obviously a little uptight. Taylor gives him a chuck on the shoulder. \nTAYLOR Take it easy. We got 162 of these to go. \nLou Brown enters the locker room. \nBROWN All right, let's gather 'round. \nThe players turn their attention to Brown. \nBROWN I'm not much for inspirational addresses. I just wanta point out that every newspaper in the country has picked us to finish last. The local press thinks we'd save everybody a lot of time and trouble if we just went out and shot ourselves. Me, I like to waste sportswriters' time so I'm for hangin' around and seein' if we can give all these guys a nice big shitburger to eat. \nCheers all around. \nHARRIS Aren't we gonna have a prayer? I mean we're not all savages like Cerrano. \nBROWN You guys go ahead. I belong to the church of three-run homers. \nHARRIS All right, let's bow our heads. \nMany of the players follow suit. Suddenly the silence is shattered by a loud explosive SOUND, scaring the hell out of everybody. All eyes turn to Cerrano, who has just set off a charge of gunpowder on his locker altar. \nCERRANO Have to wake up bats. \nDisgusted, Harris and the others turn back to their prayers. \nHARRIS Dear Lord, we ask... \nHarris never gets to finish. The smoke rising from Cerrano's gunpowder explosion sets off the automatic sprinklers in the ceiling. As Harris and the faithful look up into the downpour, we... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MUNICIPAL STADIUM - DAY \nThe stands are nearly empty. Of the fans who have showed up, many wear doormats around their necks. \nBobby, Vic, Johnny and Thelma, our four fans from the diner, sit alone in the vast expanse of the centerfield bleachers. All four wear Indian head dresses and have war paint on their faces. The three men each have tom-toms. Thelma works on her needlepoint. \n", "test2_true": "THELMA Everybody laughs at the Indians now, but there were other times. Even won the Series in '48. Then Willie Mays made that catch on Vic Wertz in the '54 Series and Cleveland's never been the same since. \nJOHNNY As the Indians go so goes Cleveland, huh? \nTHELMA If we ever lost the Indians, Cleveland would die. \nINT. MUNICIPAL STADIUM PRESS BOX - DAY \nWe get our fist glimpse of HARRY DOYLE, the Indians' 55-year- old radio announcer. Harry's never walked past a bar in anger. He's been with the Indians through thin and thinner. \nDOYLE (on the air) Hello, everybody, Harry Doyle here, welcoming all you Friends of the Feather to another season of Indians baseball. (pouring some Jack Daniels in his Coke) A lotta new faces for the tribe this year, as they take on the defending American League champs, the New York Yankees. And listen to the roar of the crowd as the Indians takes the field! \nDoyle leans out the press box window with his mike, trying to pick up the sound of a couple guys CLAPPING down below. \nDOYLE Yes, sir, they love this club here in Cleveland. \nDoyle takes a hit of his spiked Coke. \nDOWN ON THE FIELD \nA YANKEE HITTER \nflies out to Hayes, who makes a \"basket\" catch a la Willie Mays. \nDOYLE (V.O.) High fly ball, centerfield. Hayes under it now... Oh, makes a basket catch, Willie Mays style, and the side is retired. \nTHE INDIAN DUGOUT \nThe team comes in off the field to much enthusiasm and back- slapping. \nBROWN All right, way to look, way to look. Nice catch, Hayes. Don't ever fuckin' do it again. Okay, let's get it goin'! \nDOYLE IN THE PRESS BOX \nDOYLE Bottom of the first, Willie Mays Hayes to lead it off for the tribe. \nHAYES \ngoing through his warmup routine at the plate. \nDOYLE (V.O.) A lotta people say you can tell how a season's gonna go by the first hitter of the year. In the last fifteen years, the Indians have never had the season lead-off hitter reach base. \nHayes is in the batter's box now. The Yankee pitcher winds and fires. Hayes swings and hits a little dribbler toward the second baseman, who races in and scoops it up bare-handed. \nDOYLE (V.O.) Hot shot toward the hole. Rudia knocks it down, gets up, fires to first. Too late! Hayes beats it! \nDoyle leans out the window again trying to pick up some cheering. \nDOYLE And so the string is broken. Maybe things will turn around a little for the Indians this year. \nTHE BLEACHERS \nOur four fans (from here on known as the Bleacher Band), overjoyed by Hayes' hit, start beating the tom-toms and singing a fight song they've composed called \"In the Land Of Burning Waters\" to the tune of the old Hamms Beer jingle. \nBLEACHER BAND In the land of burning waters, waters Lurks the Injun nine, oh so fine, we Love those mighty Redmen, Turn their foes to dead men, Ummmmm. \nFIRST BASE AREA \nas Hayes comes back to the bag, where the Yankee FIRST BASEMAN is waiting for him. \nFIRST BASEMAN Showed some real power on that one, Slugger. \nHAYES I plan to get at least a double out of it. \nHayes reaches in his back pocket and pulls out one of the pairs of black leather gloves he bought earlier. \nDOYLE (V.O.) And now Hayes is putting on a pair of black gloves, sending a little message to the Yankees. \nHAYES (to the First Baseman) Bought a hundred of these, one for each base I plan to steal. Excuse me, here, I gotta take my first step toward the Hall of Fame. \nHayes takes his lead-off and crouches, ready to steal. \nFIRST BASEMAN You look real sharp, but you'll never steal second with your shoe untied. \nHayes looks down at his shoe. It's not untied. He notices too late that the PITCHER is throwing over to pick him off. \nDOYLE (V.O.) Brewster, quick move to first... \nHayes dives back for the bag, but never gets there; his face smashing up against the First Baseman's glove, which is already holding the ball. \nDOYLE (V.O.) He got him. Hayes is picked off. \nFIRST BASEMAN Nice base running, dildo. Hard to get your thumb out of your ass with the gloves on. \n", "test2_id": 2722, "test3_input": "Lynn comes up the stairs, unlocks the apartment door and steps inside. There's no particular urgency. She feels sure she's shaken Taylor. \nThe apartment is full of packing boxes. Tired from the chase, Lynn drops her bag on a box and slumps down on the couch. It's obvious she's not all that happy to have lost Taylor. She goes to the window and looks down to the street for some sign of him. \nSeeing nothing, she turns away from the window disappointed, and starts back to the couch, when something stops her. It's Taylor, standing in the doorway. \nTAYLOR Whose place are we at this time? \nLYNN (flustered) Mine. You follow me again? \nTAYLOR Yeh. When I saw you at the game, I figured you wanted to see me about something. \nLYNN I just wanted to see you play. \nTAYLOR How was I? \nLYNN You looked good, but you oughta open your stance a little. They're pitchin' you inside. \nTAYLOR I'll try that. \nTaylor gives a perfunctory nod. They look at each other a second. There's still plenty there. Taylor begins to come toward her. We hear his cleats on the floor. She backs off, but not with real conviction. \nLYNN I think I oughta tell you that I'm moving in with Tom. \nTAYLOR Goin' uptown, huh? \nLYNN I'm not goin' uptown, I just want to lead a regular life. You know, like an adult maybe. With a house and a garden and normal hours. \nTAYLOR You think I can't lead a regular life? \nLYNN You like the life you've had, Jake. You like hangin' out with the boys, livin' in hotels, eatin' dinner at midnight, having girls send you their underwear in the mail. Remember the surprise party I threw for you when you made the All-Star team? You never showed up, but the doorbell rang once and we all got quiet and hid behind the furniture. It was a guy to serve you with a paternity suit. \nTAYLOR That was a hoax. The girl was just trying to get some publicity. \nLYNN Yes, but you had obviously been with her. And it happened in front of all our friends. \nTAYLOR I was drownin', Lynn. The endorsements were dryin' up, my knees were goin', they were talkin' about sendin' me down. I was just trying to hold on to somethin', prove to myself I was still an All-Star. I don't care about that anymore. I know I don't have much time left in baseball. I'm just a guy trying to put his life back together. Thinkin' about you was the only thing that kept me goin' in Mexico. \nLynn looks at him a long beat. \nLYNN I've come back to you too many times, Jake. I can't afford to believe you anymore. \nLynn is backed up against a desk now. She could move out but doesn't. \nTAYLOR I guess this is our last hurrah then. \nLYNN I guess so. Did you really read \"Moby Dick?\" \nTAYLOR Cover to cover. \nTaylor comes forward to kiss her, tentatively at first. Their conversation is interwoven with the slowly deepening intensity of their kissing. \nTAYLOR When's the wedding? \nLYNN October third. \nTAYLOR Your mom and dad like this guy? \nLYNN You're still their favorite. \nThey're unbuttoning each other's shirts now. \nTAYLOR Gonna be a big wedding? \nLYNN Tom doesn't like big weddings. You coulda read Plot Outlines of 101 Great Novels. \nTAYLOR Where? \nLYNN At any library. \nTAYLOR I mean the wedding. \nLYNN All Saints on Euclid. \nTAYLOR Nice church. \nLYNN Yeh. Who saved Ishmael at the end? \nTAYLOR Nobody. It was Queequeg's coffin. Am I invited? \nLYNN Where? \nTAYLOR To the wedding. \nLYNN If you want.

We were always good at this. \nTAYLOR Lynn? \nLYNN What? \nTAYLOR The zipper on your skirt is stuck. \nLYNN Use your imagination. \nTaylor's spikes come down across her skirt, catching in the material, ripping it from her body and pinning it to the wood floor. Taylor steps out of the shoe and whisks Lynn OUT OF FRAME. We hold on the skirt, nailed to the floor by the cleats. \nINT. LYNN'S BEDROOM - MORNING \nTaylor wakens and turns over to find Lynn gone. He looks around but there's no sign of her. \nEXT. LYNN'S APARTMENT - DAY \nTaylor comes down the steps, gets in his car, and drives OUT OF FRAME. We HOLD on the SHOT, and... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nTHE SAME SHOT - THAT NIGHT \nTaylor's car pulls INTO FRAME. He gets out and goes up the steps. There's one light on in the apartment window. Taylor comes up to the door and knocks. Getting no answer, he pushes it open to find that the apartment is completely empty. Just bare hardwood floor. Taylor stands forlorn in the center of the room a beat, then walks on out, switching off the overhead light as he goes. \nINT. RACHEL PHELPS' OFFICE - DAY \nDonovan is present once again. Rachel does not look pleased. \nRACHEL Well, my worst fears have been confirmed. We're 60 and 60, nine games out of first, and only two out of the first division. Who do those guys think they are? \nDONOVAN Maybe you just have to accept the fact that they're not as bad as you'd hoped. \nRACHEL I don't have to accept anything. Our attendance is only beginning to rise. If we can force a losing streak for a week or two, we can still turn this thing around. The fans are used to losers here. At the first sign of a slump they'll give up on this team. \nDONOVAN What's left to do? You've taken away everything you can. \nRACHEL Not everything. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - DAY \nWe pick up a decrepit old Greyhound bus coming down the highway, belching smoke like a diesel semi. On the side we see the visage of Chief Wahoo and the words \"Indian Express.\" \nINT. INDIAN EXPRESS - DAY \nComplete with all the luxuries of the average school bus. Temple is looking at a memo from Rachel Phelps. \nTEMPLE Memo says we'll only be usin' this for short trips. \nBROWN Good thing we don't play anybody in Europe. \nTAYLOR AND HAYES \nTaylor is staring out the window, still morose about Lynn's leaving. A stack of Classics Illustrated comics sits next to him. \nHAYES Can I borrow one of those, man? They don't have any magazines on this bus. \nTAYLOR Sure, go ahead. I think my reading days are over. \nHAYES Macbeth. This a good one? \nTAYLOR (pointing to his stack of Classics) These are all Hall of Famers. \nHayes is impressed. \nEXT. CITY OF NEW YORK - NIGHT \nThe Indian Express makes its way through the streets of New York, enroute to the Indian's hotel. \nINT. INDIAN EXPRESS - FULL SHOT \nWe see that now most of the team is reading classic comics. \nHAYES (to Dorn) I'll trade you Song of Hiawatha for The Deerslayer. \nDORN Naw, I'm not into Song of Hiawatha. \nHAYES All right then, how about Crime and Punishment? \nDORN Yeh, that sounds pretty good.

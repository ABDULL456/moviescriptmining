5    INT. KLINGMAN'S OFFICE DEN - NIGHT                         5 In a paneled room tastefully hung with a few choice paint- ings that reflect Klingman's success as an arbitrageur, he pours two snifters of brandy as he speaks with Farmer. 
KLINGMAN Your hands ever shake, Frank? FRANK Sometimes.   It's just adrenaline. KLINGMAN ... How did you know? FRANK I saw him washing the car. KLINGMAN I saw him. FRANK They don't wash cars on the parking levels. He hands a glass of brandy to Frank, who looks at it. KLINGMAN You know, I'd like you to stay on. He passes a small sealed envelope to Frank. FRANK I'm not good in permanent positions, my feet go to sleep. The two men smile at each other. They raise their glasses in a joint salutation -- Klingman drinks. Frank doesn't. 
6   INT. DARKENED ROOM - DESK TOP - NIGHT                      6 The rubber-gloved hands are glueing the word "TIME" onto a message that is taking the classic form of a ransom note. Each word has been cut from a different page and is in a different typeface. The note is being assembled with such care that it has an unusually neat appearance and is quite easy to read. It reads: MARRON BITCH -- YOU HAVE EVERYTHING I HAVE NOTHING. THE TIME TO DIE IS ... 
7   EXT. CHARITY CONCERT - EVENING                             7 A blur of hands and faces. Excited fans. Pieces of paper, autograph books, notes are thrust forward INTO the CAMERA. Again, a mass chanting "Rachel! Rachel! Rachel!" Hands of Rachel's entourage accept some of the proffered items. In CLOSEUP, we see Rachel's hands signing "Best wishes, 
Rachel Marron" on an out-stretched open palm. In the midst of the urgent forest of hands and paper, a be- ribboned black doll is thrust forward, bearing the legend "RACHEL, WE LOVE YOU." 
8    EXT. FRANK FARMER'S HOUSE - EVENING                        8 
SLAM of a CAR DOOR. Frank gets out of a cab with two suitcases. His house is a modest stucco affair on a small lot. He goes up the walk and puts down his suit- cases. He looks at rampant foliage and overgrown grass. Supermarket circulars cover his doorstep. He picks up a few and fishes a bunch of keys from his pocket. A curious neighbor peers from behind a net curtain. As the door opens, we are aware of a further pile of mail inside. Frank's feet push the letters aside and go inside. The door shuts. 
10   INT. FARMER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT                              10 Farmer has carefully set a place for himself at the table in a breakfast nook. A bottle of red wine is open with a glass beside it. At the stove he stirs and flavors a Boeuf Bourgignon and reads a Time magazine. He adds a splash of wine. He lifts the pot from the stove and tries a piece of meat. At the table, he looks at the place setting and absently eats another piece of meat. Finally he sets the pot on the plate and eats from it directly while glancing through the magazine. 
11   INT. DRESSING ROOM - CLOSEUP - CORNER OF DRESSING TABLE    11 Lots of people are schmoozing in the dressing room. There's a loud buzz of excited chatter. Hands are stack- ing flowers, good luck messages, cards and cables by the mirror. Through the blur and bustle, we glimpse the doll with its embroidered ribbon message "RACHEL, WE LOVE YOU." Hands casually move it to one side, among the flowers resting on the small portable TV set. On the screen is an image of Rachel performing on stage, acknowledging applause, bowing. The doll EXPLODES, SHATTERING the TV, the MIRROR and the LIGHT BULBS. The SCREEN GOES BLACK, amid SHOUTS, SCREAMS and CONFUSION. TITLES END. 
12   EXT. FRANK FARMER'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY                 12 Frank lounges in his shorts under the single tree, sun- glasses on, a glass of iced tea by his side. Strains of "DON'T WALK AWAY RENEE" come from a beat-up transistor RADIO. 
An old-fashioned lawn sprinkler lazily waves water back and forth over the freshly cut grass.  Throwing knives lay scattered nearby. A wooden post is  sticking out of the ground in front of the fence at the back of the yard. BILL DEVANEY, fiftyish, a distinguished-looking black gentleman, stands nearby trying to engage Frank in a conversation that up to this point hasn't been going well. He's Rachel's personal manager. DEVANEY So, you won't protect Rachel Marron just because she's in show business? FRANK I don't do celebrities. DEVANEY But the biggest money's in show business people. Frank says nothing. His  eyes are  closed behind the sun- glasses. Devaney picks  up one of  the throwing knives. He holds it carefully by the blade  and throws it. It misses the post by three feet and  clatters against the fence. Frank opens his eyes, sees what's going on and closes his eyes again. DEVANEY (picking up another knife) Do you really do these things? FRANK Isn't she the one who collects dolls? This is enough to distract Devaney from his knife-throwing. DEVANEY (exasperated) Farmer, Rachel Marron is one of the most famous people in America. She's won every music award invented. She's got the number one song in the country right now and she'll probably be nominated for an Oscar in her very 
first picture. And you want to know 'Isn't she the one...?' Christ, man, where've you been? FRANK You mean she doesn't collect dolls?

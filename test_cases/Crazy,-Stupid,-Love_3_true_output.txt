31 IN A BEAUTY SUPPLY STORE 31

CAL What does it do? 
JACOB (SARCASTIC) It gives you x-ray vision, Cal. (THEN) It tightens things up. The skin around your eyes looks like Milton Berle's ballsack. 
Cal stops, examines his eyes in a mirror. 
CAL Oh my God, it does. 
32 IN A SALON 32 
Cal is getting his hair cut at a fancy salon. The HAIRDRESSER is young, hip, and beautiful.

They head towards the bar and Diane follows. The two women she turned away from shake their heads at the spectacle. 
DIANE But, but we were talking about juries and Isaac and, and that drag queen I broke my face on and.. 
The two men try to ignore her, but she keeps following them. She finally realizes they aren't stopping. She grabs the first man by the shoulder, pissed. 
DIANE Hey! COCKBREATH! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
The party stops. Everyone is staring at Diane as the music continues to play. She looks around the room at the disapproving eyes, panic setting in. 
EXT. THE HOUSE OF THE PARTY - LATER. 
Diane is led away by Martin and Mini, as other partygoers watch the sad scene. They both struggle to keep Diane from stumbling. 
DIANE (slurring) ...And then I told him that I had been an extra on Hello Larry and Mike Farrell had tried to-- 
MINI MacLean Stevenson. 
DIANE What? 
MINI MacLean Stevenson played "Larry." 
DIANE Right, that's what I said...and then MacKenzie Phillips tried to slip me the tongue! 
INT. THE MASTER BEDROOM - LATER. 
Diane lies passed out on the bed as Mini and Martin watch her sleep. 
MARTIN Listen, great job, but you need to give me more warning. I was at dinner with Chapman, and it's the second time I've had to re- schedule. 
MINI I'm sorry, but it was a golden opportunity. You always said you can't pay enough for good publicity. 
INT. A HARDWARE STORE - DAY 
Mini and Martin peruse the aisles. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MINI (V.O.) At this point, with all those witnesses, Martin thought we could get a shrink to have her sent away. T hey stop in front of a wall of tools: hand axes, hammers and saws. Mini selects a large hand axe. 
MINI (V.O.) My feeling was that until they were ready to weld the door to her padded cell shut... 
CUT TO: 
Mini picking out two black ski masks, two pairs of black goggles and two black sweatsuits. 
MINI (V.O.) ...there was more work to be done. 
INT. THE SHERMAN OAKS GALLERIA - DAY 
Diane walks through the mall aimlessly. She wears a wrinkled, mis-buttoned pink blouse. Her eyes are hollow, her cheeks sunken. A few SHOPPERS throw her a concerned glance as they pass. 
MINI (V.O.) Final phase: Complete psychotic breakdown. 
MINI, disguised in a hat and sunglasses, leans on the railing from the next level up, watching her mother. 
INT. THE FOOD COURT OF THE MALL - CONTINUOUS 
Mini slides into a table next to TWO SKATEPUNKS. 
MINI Hey, boys. 
The two guys exchange a glance. Cute girls like Mini clearly don't "hey, boys" them. 
MINI Wanna have a little fun? 
INT. THE DISPLAY WINDOW OF A STORE - CONTINUOUS 
Diane looks at some clothes. RING! Her cell phone goes off and she answers it. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DIANE Hello? 
MALE VOICE (V.O.) (breathy, threatening) Diane? 
DIANE Yes? 
The breathing increases, getting deeper and more menacing. 
DIANE Hello?...What do you want? 
MALE VOICE (V.O.) I can see you? Can you see me? 
DIANE (alarmed) Who is this?

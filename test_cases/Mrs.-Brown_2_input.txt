BROWN and VICTORIA are riding on horseback.  Although better than he was, BROWN'S face is still badly bruised. They turn a corner banked by trees.  BROWN is watching the QUEEN closely.  She stops. 
VICTORIA I would like to get down. 
Without a word, BROWN dismounts and helps her off her horse. 
VICTORIA (CONT'D) John? 
BROWN Yes, ma'am? 
VICTORIA I was told you were in a fight. 
BROWN Yes, ma'am. 
VICTORIA Has someone seen to those bruises? 
BROWN Yes, ma'am. 
A beat. 
BROWN (CONT'D) Ma'am? 
VICTORIA Yes? 
BROWN Having considered my position here at court, I have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of Your Majesty that I should resign. 
VICTORIA I do not accept. 
A beat. 
BROWN I had foreseen that you would not. But Your Majesty should understand -- that my mind will not be changed in this.  I leave for Deeside -- 
VICTORIA (cutting in) The Queen forbids it. (beat) I cannot allow it because I cannot live without you.  Without you, I cannot find the strength to be who I must be.  Please. 
She takes his hand to her mouth and kisses it gently, then looks at him, utterly helpless. 
VICTORIA (CONT'D) Promise me you won't let them send me back. 
A long silence.  BROWN holds her hand tight. 
BROWN I promise. 
FADE TO BLACK.

EXT. LOWLANDS - DAY 
A few weeks later. 
A tiny horse-drawn carriage creeps across a huge Highland landscape. 
DISRAELI (V.O.) Yesterday, Gladstone talked for three hours on the Irish Church Bill ... I am as guilty as the rest of underestimating his reforming zeal. Tory days may be numbered, but I fancy there yet remains one last hope of deliverance.  Wheresoever the blame lies, we must now close ranks and defend Mrs Brown's England.  As for my interminable journey to the land of Calvin, oatcakes and sulphur ... 
EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY 
DISRAELI hurries through the pouring rain. 
DISRAELI (O.S.) ... no Prime Minister made greater sacrifice than attempting to run the country six hundred miles north of civilization.

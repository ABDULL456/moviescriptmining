Pappas pulls away from the curb, roaring past the other agents sedan.  Utah and Cole flip each other off perfunctorily as they pass. 
UTAH When did Harp say they'd have the warrant? 
PAPPAS He's pushing it through first thing. You better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  BODHI'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
A bunker-like structure built of stone and glass on a cliff overlooking the Pacific.  Surfmobiles and motorcycles parked in front.  A strong backbeat thumps through the open front doors. Tyler's Porsche pulls into the driveway.  She and Johnny get out and head for the entrance. 
UTAH Nice place. 
TYLER He rents it for the summer.  Bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around.  Most a these guys can't keep a job.  When the swell comes, they're gone, they have to ride. 
INT./ EXT.  BODHI'S HOUSE 
Tyler leads Utah through the steady flow of SURF-RATS and other PCH NOMADS toward a large outdoor deck where a barbecue is in progress.  Moonlit waves pound the shore eighty feet below. 
They are immediately distracted by the small crowd gathering around GROMMET who has his nose pressed flat against the center of a dart board. His eyes swivels back to ROACH, standing fifteen feet away, dart in hand, getting ready to throw. 
GROMMET Do your worst, man! 
Roach drains a beer in one gulp, spies the sharp needle point of the dart, then squints at the target. ROSIE moves through the small crowd collecting bets. 
Suddenly Roaches arm snaps back.  A collective hush... In a blur of tattoos the small feathered missile is airborne. 
TWAAAPPPPPP!  Bulls-eye.  Centimeters from flesh.  Grommet secretly exhales.  Roach howls as Rosie rains money on his head. The crowd goes wild. BODHI stands nearby with his arm around a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. Pleased to see Utah, he motions him over. 
UTAH Don't you gamble? 
BODHI Only make bets I can't afford to lose.  Only way to be 100% committed. 
With that, Bodhi smiles, then he and the woman vanish into the crowd.  Utah watches them go, turns to Tyler. 
UTAH Who's the girl? 
TYLER Catch of the day. 
UTAH Oh, oh.  That sounds personal. 
TYLER People are expendable to Bodhi. 
UTAH Meaning you were expendable. 
TYLER (shrugs) We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them.  But you can't hold it against him, he's... different. 
UTAH Sure, he's "the Bodhisattva". 
TYLER (she chuckles) Yeah, he thinks he's evolved to a higher plane of existence, or something. (thoughtful) Maybe he has.  You've seen him surf... that frenzy.  It seems like anger.  It's not.  It's the energy of lovemaking.  The sea is the woman in his life.  She's his only true lover. 
Utah studies her a moment.  He's caught the faintest hint of regret in her voice.  But also the straight-ahead pragmatism.  He looks down at the waves pounding mercilessly against the rocks. 
UTAH All she does is beat the shit out of me. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
PARTY - LATER 
Lingering surf-rats stoned and drunk. Nathaniel stands on the railing of the deck, Corona in hand, gazing out at the black water.  He grins sloppily, body wavering dangerously as he hunkers down into a surfing stance. 
NATHANIEL (beer soaked speech) ... Okay, so you're in the face, it's twenty-five feet straight down, your balls are about this big. (like he's holding up two BB's) And the whole thing's moving, right, roaring like you're stuck to the front of a freight train.  There ain't nothin' like it, man.  The ultimate rush.  Forget about sex, it doesn't even come close. 
ROACH You lose it right then, you're history.  The fish'll be pickin' you outta the coral. 
Nathaniel cackles that absurd Pee-Wee Herman laugh.  He starts to flail, arms pinwheeling. Utah catches him by the back of the shorts and pulls him back.  Nathaniel spins and drops clumsily onto the deck. 
NATHANIEL (matter of factly) Thanks, brah. 
Tyler sits next to Johnny, sipping a beer.  Bodhi is not in sight. 
ROACH See, it's all dynamic, it's all in motion.  You can't just stop and walk on in to the beach if you don't like the way things are going, y' know what I mean?  You gotta ride it out man, all the way.

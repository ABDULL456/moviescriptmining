EXT. PLASZOW - LATER - DAY 
The needle of the phonograph is set down on another record, a children's song, "Mammi, kauf mir ein Pferdchen" (Mommy, buy me a pony). 
Children are yanked from the arms of their parents. Wailing protests quickly escalate to brawls with the guards. 
Revolvers and rifles aim at the sun and fire. Music, shots, wails. 
INT. BARRACKS - SAME TIME - DAY 
Guards traipse through a deserted barracks peering up at the rafters, pulling planks from the floor, upending cots, looking for some children. 
EXT. BARRACKS - SAME TIME - DAY 
A small figure in red sprints across to another barracks, past it, to a crude wooden structure beyond it. 
INT. MEN'S LATRINES - SAME TIME - DAY 
An arm held out to either side, the small girl lowers herself into a pit into which men have defecated. She works her way slowly down, trying to find knee and toeholds on the foul walls, ignoring the flies invading her ears, her nostrils. 
Reaching the surface of the muck she lets her feet submerge, then her ankles, her shins, her knees, before finally 
touching harder ground. As she struggles to slow her breathing, her racing heart, she hears a hallucinatory murmur -- 
BOY'S VOICE This is our place. 
She sees eyes in the darkness; five other children are already there. 
EXT. DEPOT - PLASZOW - LATER - DAY 
Waves of heat rise from the roofs of the long string of cattle cars. Inside, those who "failed" the medical exams bake as they wait for the last cars to be filled. 
Schindler's Mercedes pulls up. He climbs out and stares transfixed. He notices Goeth then, standing with the other industrialists, Bosch and Madritsch, and strolls over to them. 
GOETH I tried to call you, I'm running a little late, this is taking longer than I thought. Have a drink. 
SCHINDLER What's going on? 
GOETH I got a shipment of Hungarians coming in, I got to make room for them. It's always something. 
He glances away at the train. The idling engine only partially covers the desperate pleas for water coming from inside the slatted cars. 
GOETH They're complaining now? They don't know what complaining is. 
He grins. Schindler watches as another car is loaded. It's like they're climbing into an oven. 
SCHINDLER What do you say we get your fire brigade out here and hose down the cars? 
Goeth stares at him blankly, then with a What-will-you-think- of-next? kind of look, then laughs uproariously and calls over to Hujar -- 
GOETH Bring the fire trucks! 
HUJAR What? 
Hujar heard him, he just doesn't get it. Finally he turns to another guy and tells him to do it. 
STREAM OF WATER CASCADE onto the scalding rooftops. The fire trucks are there, the hoses firing the cold water at the cars on the people inside who are roaring their gratitude. 
GOETH This is really cruel, Oskar, you're giving them hope. You shouldn't do that, that's cruel. 
And amusing, not just to Goeth, but to the other SS officers standing around as well. Oskar moves away to talk with one of the firemen. At full extension, apparently the hoses still only reach halfway down the long line of cars. He returns to Goeth. 
SCHINDLER I've got some 200-meter hoses back at D.E.F., we can reach the cars down at the end. 
Goeth finds this especially sidesplitting, and hollers -- 
GOETH Hujar! 
THE D.E.F. HOSES have arrived and are being coupled to Plaszow's. As the water drenches the cars further back, the people inside loudly voice their thanks, and the guards and officers outside grin at the spectacle. 
GUARD What does he think he's saving them from? 
The joke takes on new dimension when, from the back of the D.E.F. trucks, boxes of food are unloaded. Accompanied by the laughter of the SS, Schindler moves along the string of cars pushing sausages through the slats. 
GOETH Oh, my God. 
Goeth is almost hysterical. But slowly then, slowly, the amusement on his face fades. His friend moving along the cars bringing futile mercy to the doomed in front of countless SS men, laughing or not, is not just behaving recklessly here, it's as though he were possessed. 
The water rains down on the last car. 
EXT. D.E.F. - DAY 
A German staff car pulls in across the factory gate, blocking it. Two Gestapo men climb out. 
INT. D.E.F. FACTORY - DAY 
The girl who brought Schindler best wishes on his birthday glances up from her work to the Gestapo crossing through the factory. They climb the stairs to the upstairs offices and, moments later, appear behind Schindler's wall of glass. 
INT. SCHINDLER'S OFFICE - DAY 
Schindler leaning against his desk, drink in his hand, calmly tries to assess his humorless arresters.

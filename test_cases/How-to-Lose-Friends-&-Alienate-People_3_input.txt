SIDNEY (staring at a 
PHOTOGRAPH) Okay, I've got two old men here - so is he the fat one? 
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) 
(BEAT) You do realize that Clayton Harding is a personal friend of mine? 
SIDNEY 
(BEAT) What's that got to do with anything? 
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Right. She hangs up. Beat. Sidney looks around, hoping no-one was listening. He re-dials. 
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D) Parsons gallery. 
SIDNEY Is he the one with the wonky eye? 
She hangs up again. 
CUT TO 
42 INT. LOBBY - LIFT - DAY 42 
Sidney, coming back from lunch, gets into the lift eating a HAMBURGER. Another of the magazine's Fashionistas - ANNA - gets into the lift and tries to hold the door open for an approaching friend. The doors swish shut, Anna pulling her hand out of the way just in time. The lift rises. 
SIDNEY It's fashion sensitive. If you're not wearing Prada it'll take your arm clean off. Anna stares at this strange man with the burger, baffled. 
ANNA But I am wearing Prada. The lift stops and she gets out. Alison gets in, sees Sidney and winces. She takes out a book and pretends to read. The lift begins to rise again. Through it's glass doors we see the different floors passing, different publications - each a hive of sober, hard work. Sidney stares at them. 
SIDNEY 
(MOUTH FULL) This isn't what I expected. Alison recoils slightly. 
ALISON What did you expect? 
SIDNEY I don't know. The Algonquin circle. Dorothy Parker. Martinis. Quips. Look at them. Not one of them is drunk. 
ALISON It's called being a professional. You should try it some time. 
SIDNEY There's something you should understand. I'm not really one of you. 
ALISON By "you" do you mean "human?" 
SIDNEY I mean the glossy posse. Bunch of Zombies, writing about "Pets of the Stars" but acting like they're working for the UN. I'm here to shake things up a bit. Where are you from? 
ALISON Not that it's any of your business, but I'm from Port Huron, Michigan. 
SIDNEY Right. Small town girl. (Hannibal Lector impersonation) I bet you could only dream of getting out. Getting anywhere - yes, Clarice? Getting all the way - to the N...Y...C. (Dropping the impersonation) Take my advice, don't go taking this celebrity fluff seriously. For a moment Alison is speechless with anger. 
ALISON You...you...arrogant... The lift stops and a TALL WOMAN enters. She is expensively dressed, wears Chanel dark glasses, an expression of granite and an air of superhuman froideur. Alison exchanges the slightest of nods with her and stares tensely ahead. Only Sidney, busy chewing, is oblivious to the plunge in temperature. For a moment there is only the soft whir of the lift. Then Sidney begins to choke on some burger. He wheezes for a moment, gagging. The Woman stiffens slightly but shows no other sign of having noticed the revolting noises coming from behind her. Alison closes her eyes. Sidney gives a violent cough and a chunk of chewed burger and coleslaw flies out of his mouth and lands on the back of the oblivious Woman's Prada jacket. Sidney notices and raises a tentative hand to brush the offending item away. Before he can move Alison silently takes his wrist in a vice-like grip. 
43 CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER 43 Alison is haranguing Sidney. 
ALISON 
(HISSING) Are you insane? That was Lawrence's wife, Elizabeth! Her father owns Sharps! 
SIDNEY That was her? The Mussolini baby? He stops. 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) I could go back and tell her I'm... 
ALISON No! Listen to me - you do NOT approach Elizabeth Maddox, you do NOT talk to her! Don't even make eye-contact with her? Do you understand? 
SIDNEY Am I supposed to be afraid? 
ALISON Yes. 
SIDNEY I don't know the meaning of the word fear. 
ALISON I'm sure there are many words you don't know the meaning of! She walks on, shaking her head in disbelief. 
ALISON (CONT'D) When I think of all the people who would kill to be where you are. And you lumber in here, spitting food, haven't got the brains God gave a mollusc...why did Clayton hire you?

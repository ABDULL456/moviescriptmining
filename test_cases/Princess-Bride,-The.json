In that case, I challenge you to a battle of wits. \nVIZZINI For the Princess? \nThe Man In Black nods. \nVIZZINI To the death? \nAnother nod. \nVIZZINI I accept. \nMAN IN BLACK Good. Then pour the wine. \nAs Vizzini fills the goblets with the dark red liquid, the Man In Black pulls a small packet from his clothing, handing it to Vizzini. \nMAN IN BLACK Inhale this, but do not touch. \nVIZZINI (doing it) I smell nothing. \nMAN IN BLACK (taking the packet back) What you do not smell is called iocane powder. It is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man. \nVIZZINI Hmm. \nCUT TO: \nVIZZINI \nwatching excitedly as the Man In Black takes the goblets, turns his back. A moment later, he turns again, faces Vizzini, drops the iocane packet. It is now empty. \nThe Man In Black rotates the goblets in a little shell game maneuver then puts one glass in front of Vizzini, the other in front of himself. \nMAN IN BLACK All right: where is the poison? The battle of wits has begun. It ends when you decide and we both drink, and find out who is right and who is dead. \nVIZZINI But it's so simple. All I have to do is divine from what I know of you. Are you the sort of man who would put the poison into his own goblet, or his enemy's? \nHe studies the Man In Black now. \nVIZZINI Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. I'm not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But you must have known I was not a great fool; you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me. \nMAN IN BLACK (And now there's a trace of nervousness beginning) You've made your decision then7 \nVIZZINI Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. \nMAN IN BLACK Truly, you have a dizzying intellect. \nVIZZINI Wait till I get going! Where was I? \nMAN IN BLACK Australia. \nVIZZINI Yes -- Australia, and you must have suspected I would have known the powder's origin, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me. \nMAN IN BLACK (very nervous) You're just stalling now. \nVIZZINI (cackling) You'd like to think that, wouldn't you? (stares at the Man in Black) You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong. So, you could have put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But, you've also bested my Spaniard which means you must have studied. And in studying, you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me. \nAs Vizzini's pleasure has been growing throughout, the Man In Black's has been fast disappearing. \nMAN IN BLACK You're trying to trick me into giving away something -- it won't work -- \nVIZZINI (triumphant) It has worked -- you've given everything away -- I know where the poison is. \nMAN IN BLACK (fool's courage) Then make your choice. \nVIZZINI I will. And I choose -- \nAnd suddenly he stops, points at something behind the Man In Black. \nVIZZINI -- what in the world can that be? \nCUT TO: \nTHE MAN IN BLACK \nturning around, looking. \nMAN IN BLACK What? Where? I don't see anything. \nCUT TO: \nVIZZINI \nbusily switching the goblets while the Man In Black has his head turned. \nVIZZINI Oh, well, I-I could have sworn I saw something. No matter. \nThe Man In Black turns to face him again. Vizzini starts to laugh. \nMAN IN BLACK What's so funny? \nVIZZINI I'll tell you in a minute. First, let's drink -- me from my glass, and you from yours. \nAnd he picks up his goblet. The Man In Black picks up the one in front of him. As they both start to drink, Vizzini hesitates a moment. \nThen, allowing the Man In Black to drink first, he swallows his wine. \nMAN IN BLACK You guessed wrong. \n", "test1_true": "CUT TO: \nTHE MAN IN BLACK \nThere's nothing he can say. He just sits there. \nCUT TO: \nVIZZINI \nwatching him. \nVIZZINI You fell victim to one of the classic blunders. The most famous is \"Never get involved in a land war in Asia.\" But only slightly less well known is this: \"Never go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line.\" \nHe laughs and roars and cackles and whoops and is in all ways quite cheery until he falls over dead. \nCUT TO: \nTHE MAN IN BLACK \nstepping past the corpse, taking the blindfold and bindings off Buttercup, who notices Vizzini lying dead. \nThe Man In Black pulls her to her feet. \nBUTTERCUP Who are you? \nMAN IN BLACK I am no one to be trifled with, that is all you ever need know. \nHe starts to lead her off the mountain path into untraveled terrain. \nBUTTERCUP (a final glance back toward Vizzini) To think -- all that time it was your cup that was poisoned. \nMAN IN BLACK They were both poisoned. I spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder. \nAnd with that, he takes off, dragging her behind him. \nCUT TO: \nA MOUNTAIN PATH \nIt's where FEZZIK fought the Man in Black. CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL the Prince, kneeling, inspecting every grain of misplaced sand. The others wait behind him. \nHUMPERDINCK Someone has beaten a giant! (roaring) There will be great suffering in Guilder if she dies. \nHe leaps onto his horse and they charge off. \nCUT TO: \nA WILD STRETCH OF TERRAIN \nThe Man In Black comes running into view, still dragging Buttercup, who sometimes stumbles, but he keeps forcing her along. Finally, when she is close to exhaustion, he lets go of her. \nMAN IN BLACK (his voice harsh now, carrying the promise of violence) Catch your breath. \nBUTTERCUP If you'll release me ... whatever you ask for ransom ... you'll get it, I promise you... \nMAN IN BLACK And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness. \nBUTTERCUP I was giving you a chance. No matter where you take me ... there's no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck. He could track a falcon on a cloudy day. He can find you \nMAN IN BLACK You think your dearest love will save you? \nBUTTERCUP I never said he was my dearest love. And yes, he will save me. That I know. \nMAN IN BLACK You admit to me you do not love your fiance? \nBUTTERCUP He knows I do not love him. \nMAN IN BLACK \"Are not capable of love\" is what you mean. \nBUTTERCUP I have loved more deeply than a killer like yourself could ever dream. \nAnd the Man In Black cocks back a fist. Buttercup flinches, but does not retreat. \nMAN IN BLACK That was a warning, Highness. The next time, my hand flies on its own. For where I come from, there are penalties when a woman lies. \nCUT TO: \nVIZZINI'S BODY \nThe picnic is spread as before. \nCAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL the Prince kneeling by the body as the others ride up. The Prince grabs the empty poison packet, hands it to Rugen, after first sniffing it himself. \nHUMPERDINCK Iocane. I'd bet my life on it. (gestures to the trail ahead) And there are the Princess's footprints. She is alive ... or was, an hour ago. If she is otherwise when I find her, I shall be very put out. \nAnd as he vaults onto his horse and the all charge off -- \nCUT TO: \nBUTTERCUP \nbeing spun INTO CAMERA view, falling heavily as the Man In Black releases her. We are at the edge of an almost sheer ravine. The drop is sharp and severe.

Pallid, perhaps ill. She wanders down a corridor in Florin Castle. As she moves unseeing past an intersecting corridor: \nCUT TO: \nPRINCE HUMPERDINCK AND COUNT RUGEN \nwatching her. \nHUMPERDINCK She's been like that ever since the Fire Swamp.

Humperdinck, Rugen and the Queen stand high on the balcony. \nGRANDFATHER (off-screen) And at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen. \nHUMPERDINCK My father's final words were... \nTHE KID (off-screen) -- hold it. Hold it, Grandpa. \nAnd the scene FREEZES, Humperdinck caught in mid-sentence. \nCUT TO: \nTHE KID'S ROOM \nThe Kid is half sitting now, not strong yet, but clearly stronger than when we first saw him. \nTHE KID You read that wrong. She doesn't marry Humperdinck, she marries Westley. I'm just sure of it. After all that Westley did for her, if she does not marry him, it wouldn't be fair. \nGRANDFATHER Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair. \nTHE KID I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right! \nGRANDFATHER Do you want me to go on with this? \nTHE KID Yes. \nGRANDFATHER All right, then. No more interruptions. (starts to read again) ... at noon, she met her subjects again.

And that's what she is, the Queen of Refuse! So, bow down to her if you want. Bow to her. Bow to the Queen of Slime, the Queen of Filth, the Queen of Putrescence. Boo! Boo! Rubbish! Filth! Slime! Muck! Boo! Boo! \nShe advances on Buttercup now, who is more and more panicked. \nCLOSE-UP - THE ANCIENT BOOER \nLouder and louder and LOUDER she shrieks vituperation at Buttercup, reaching out her old hands toward Buttercup's throat, and Buttercup is as frightened now as Dorothy was when the Witch went after her in \"The Wizard of Oz\", and suddenly, \nCUT TO: \nBUTTERCUP \ncoming out of her nightmare, alone in her castle bedroom. As she frantically grabs a robe and starts to run. \nGRANDFATHER (off-screen, still reading) It was ten days till the wedding.

If you tell me I must marry you in ten days, please believe I will be dead by morning. \nCUT TO: \nPRINCE HUMPERDINCK \nJust stunned. Finally, softly, he begins to talk. \nHUMPERDINCK I could never cause you grief; consider our wedding off. (to Rugen) You returned this Westley to his ship? \nRUGEN Yes. \nHUMPERDINCK Then we will simply alert him. (to Buttercup now) Beloved, are you certain he still wants you? After all, it was you who did the leaving in the Fire Swamp. Not to mention that pirates are not known to be men of their words. \nBUTTERCUP My Westley will always come for me. \nHUMPERDINCK I suggest a deal. You write four copies of a letter. I'll send my four fastest ships. One in each direction. The Dread Pirate Roberts is always close to Florin this time of year. We'll run up the white flag and deliver your message. If Westley wants you, bless you both. If not ... please consider me as an alternative to suicide. Are we agreed? \nAnd she nods -- \nCUT TO: \nA VERY THICK GROVE OF TREES \nThe trees are unusual in one respect: all of them are extraordinarily heavily knotted. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nHumperdinck and Rugen, walking into the grove of trees. \nRUGEN Your Princess is really a winning creature. A trifle simple, perhaps, but her appeal is undeniable. \nHUMPERDINCK Oh, I know. The people are quite taken with her. It's odd, but when I hired Vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day, I thought that was clever. But it's going to be so much more moving when I strangle her on our wedding night. Once Guilder is blamed, the nation will be truly outraged. They'll demand we go to war. \nThey are deeper into the grove now. Rugen is searching around. \nRUGEN Now, where is that secret knot? It's impossible to find. (Finding the knot on the tree he hits it, and it opens, revealing a staircase leading underground.) Are you coming down into the Pit? Westley's got his strength back. I am starting him on The Machine tonight. \nHUMPERDINCK Tyrone, you know how much I love watching you work. But, I've got my country's five hundredth anniversary to plan, my wedding to arrange, My wife to murder, and Guilder to frame for it. I'm swamped. \nRUGEN Get some rest -- if you haven't got your health, you haven't got anything. \nRugen smiles and hurries down the stairs as the tree slides back perfectly into place. \nCUT TO: \nAN ENORMOUS THING \nWe can't tell quite what it is or what it does, but somehow it is unsettling. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nCount Rugen, dragging Westley up alongside the thing -- Levers and wheels and wires, you name it, it's there. \nRUGEN Beautiful, isn't it? \nThe Albino starts attaching suction cups to Westley. \nRUGEN It took me half a lifetime to invent it. I'm sure you've discovered my deep and abiding interest in pain. At present I'm writing the definitive work on the subject.

Humperdinck. Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck \nMIRACLE MAX (holding his hands over his ears) I'm not listening. \nVALERIE A life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help -- \nMIRACLE MAX Nobody's hearing nothing! \nVALERIE Humperdinck.

Humperdinck -- \nMIRACLE MAX (to Valerie) Shut up -- (now to Inigo) Wait. Wait. I make him better, Humperdinck suffers? \nINIGO Humiliations galore! \nMIRACLE MAX That is a noble cause. Give me the sixty-five, I'm on the job. \nAnd as Valerie shrieks excitedly we \nCUT TO: \nTHIS LUMP \nIt is somewhat smaller than a tennis ball. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL MAX AND VALERIE, exhausted, looking at the lump with beautific pleasure, as Valerie, cooking utensil in hand, covers the thing with what looks like chocolate. Inigo and FEZZIK stare at the thing too, but more dubiously. \nINIGO (a little appalled) That's a miracle pill? \nMax nods. \nVALERIE (finishing) The chocolate coating makes it go down easier. But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. And you shouldn't go swimming after, for at least, what? \nMIRACLE MAX An hour. \nVALERIE Yeah, an hour. \nMIRACLE MAX A good hour. Yeah. \nInigo accepts the pill as FEZZIK takes Westley, who is stiff as a board now. \nINIGO (heading out the door, Fezzik close behind) Thank you for everything. \nMIRACLE MAX Okay. \nVALERIE (waving after them) Bye-bye, boys. \nMIRACLE MAX Have fun storming the castle. \nVALERIE (to Max) Think it'll work? \nMIRACLE MAX It would take a miracle.

(indicating the half- dead Westley) We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him. \nFEZZIK Has it been fifteen minutes? \nINIGO We can't wait -- the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand. \nDuring this, FEZZIK, using all his strength, has managed to get Westley into a right angled sitting position, while Inigo brings out the miracle pill. \nINIGO Tilt his head back. Open his mouth. \nFEZZIK (following orders) How long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works? \nCUT TO: \nINIGO \nPill in hand, he drops it into Westley's mouth. \nINIGO Your guess is as good as mine -- \n", "test3_true": "FEZZIK Guess not very long. \nInigo and FEZZIK react.

That's wonderful. \nWESTLEY I've always been a quick healer. (to Inigo) What are our liabilities? \nINIGO There is but one working castle gate. \nFezzik helps Inigo raise Westley just high enough so he can see for himself. \nINIGO And it is guarded by sixty men. \nWESTLEY And our assets? \nINIGO Your brains, Fezzik's strength, my steel. \nCUT TO: \nWESTLEY \nabsolutely stunned. \nWESTLEY That's it? Impossible. If I had a month to plan, maybe I could come up with something. But this... \nHe shakes his head from side to side. \nCUT TO: \nINIGO AND FEZZIK \nFEZZIK (trying to be cheery) You just shook your head -- that doesn't make you happy? \nWESTLEY My brains, his steel, and your strength against sixty men, and you think a little head jiggle is supposed to make me happy? I mean, if we only had a wheelbarrow, that would be something. \nINIGO Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had? \nFEZZIK Over the Albino, I think. \nWESTLEY Well, why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place? What I wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak. \nINIGO There we cannot help you. \nFEZZIK (pulling one out) Will this do? \nINIGO (to Fezzik-- surprised) Where did you get that? \nFEZZIK At Miracle Max's. It fit so nice, he said I could keep it. \nWESTLEY All right, all right. Come on, help me up. \nInigo and Fezzik do. \nWESTLEY Now, I'll need a sword eventually. \nINIGO Why? You can't even lift one. \nWESTLEY True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it? (And his bead tilts limply back. Fezzik sets it up right for him) Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside. \nINIGO I'll say -- how do I find the Count? -- Once I do, how do I find you again? -- Once I find you again, how do we escape? -- \nFEZZIK (sharply) Don't pester him, he's had a hard day. \nINIGO (nods) Right, right, sorry. \nCUT TO: \nA SHOT OF THE THREE OF THEM IN PROFILE \nThey move along the wall in silence for a time.

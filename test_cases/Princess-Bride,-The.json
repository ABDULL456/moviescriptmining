{"train": "The Princess Bride by William Goldman - 1987 Shooting Draft \n\"The Princess Bride\" \nby \nWilliam Goldman \n1987-Shooting Draft \nFADE IN ON: \nA VIDEO GAME ON A COMPUTER SCREEN \nThe game is in progress. As a sick coughing sound is heard. \nCUT TO: \nTHIS KID \nlying in bed, coughing. Pale, one sick cookie. Maybe he's seven or eight or nine. He holds a remote in one hand, presses it, and the video game moves a little bit. Then he's hit by another spasm of coughing, puts the remote down. \nHis room is monochromatic, greys and blues, mildly high-tech. We're in the present day and this is a middle class house, somewhere in the suburbs. \nCUT TO: \nThe Kid's MOTHER as she enters, goes to him, fluffs his pillows, kisses him, and briefly feels his forehead. She's worried, it doesn't show. During this \nMOTHER You feeling any better? \nTHE KID A little bit. \nMOTHER Guess what. \nTHE KID What? \nMOTHER Your grandfather's here. \nTHE KID (not overjoyed) Mom, can't you tell him that I'm sick? \nMOTHER You are sick, that's why he's here. \nTHE KID He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that. \nMOTHER Maybe he won't. \nThe Kid shoots her an \"I'm sure\" look, as we \nCUT TO: \nTHE KID'S GRANDFATHER bursting into the room. Kind of rumpled. But the eyes are bright. He has a wrapped package tucked under one arm as be immediately goes to The Kid, pinches his cheek. \nGRANDFATHER Hey! How's the sickie? Heh? \nThe Kid gives his Mother an \"I told you so\" look. The Mother ignores it, beats a retreat. \nMOTHER I think I'll leave you two pals. \nAnd she is gone. There's an uncomfortable silence, then... \nGRANDFATHER I brought you a special present. \nTHE KID What is it? \nGRANDFATHER Open it up. \nThe Kid does. He does his best to smile. \nTHE KID A book? \nGRANDFATHER That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to you. \nTHE KID Has it got any sports in it? \nCUT TO: \nTHE GRANDFATHER \nSuddenly passionate. \nGRANDFATHER Are you kidding? Fencing. Fighting. Torture. Revenge. Giants. Monsters. Chases. Escapes. True love. Miracles. \nCUT TO: \nTHE TWO OF THEM as the Grandfather sits in a chair by the bed. \nTHE KID (manages a shrug) It doesn't sound too bad. I'll try and stay awake. \nGRANDFATHER Oh. Well, thank you very much. It's very nice of you. Your vote of confidence is overwhelming. All right. (Book open now, be begins to read.) The Princess Bride, by S. Morgenstern. Chapter One. Buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of Florin. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nThe story he's reading about, as the monochromatic look of the bedroom is replaced by the dazzling color of the English countryside. \nGRANDFATHER (off-screen) Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there. His name was Westley, but she never called him that. (to the kid) Isn't that a wonderful beginning? \nTHE KID (off-screen doing his best) Yeah. It's really good. \nHOLD ON HER FACE, perfect and perfectly sad. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nFLORIN CASTLE - DAY \nThe main courtyard of Florin replete with townspeople, livestock, and a bustling marketplace. \nGRANDFATHER (off-screen reading) Five years later, the main square of Florin City was filled as never before to hear the announcement of the great Prince Humperdinck's bride-to be. \nCUT TO: \nPRINCE HUMPERDINCK, a man of incredible power and bearing, standing in his royal robes on a castle balcony. Three others standing behind him: an OLD COUPLE with crowns, the aging KING AND QUEEN, and a dark bearded man who seems the Prince's match in strength: this is COUNT RUGEN. \nHUMPERDINCK (raises his hands, starts to speak) My people ... a month from now, our country will have its 500th anniversary. On that sundown, I shall marry a lady who was once a commoner like yourselves -- (pause) -- but perhaps you will not find her common now. Would you like to meet her? \nAnd the answering YESSSS booms like summer thunder. \nCUT TO: \nA giant staircase leading to the CROWD and as a FIGURE just begins to become visible, \nCUT TO: \nTHE CROWD, as they see the figure. (We haven't yet.) And if there is such a thing as collective action, then this crowd, collectively, holds its breath. \nCUT TO: \nTHE STAIRCASE, as the figure appears in the archway. It is Buttercup. And she resplendent. \nHUMPERDINCK My people ... the Princess Buttercup!! \nShe descends the stairs and starts to move amongst the people. \nCUT TO: \nTHE CROWD, and they do a very strange thing: with no instruction at all, they suddenly go to their knees. Great waves of people kneeling and -- \nCUT TO: \nBUTTERCUP, terribly moved. She stands immobile among her subjects, blinking back tears. HOLD on her beauty for a moment. \nGRANDFATHER (off-screen) Buttercup's emptiness consumed her. Although the law of the land gave Humperdinck the right to choose his bride, she did not love him. \nCUT TO: \nWOODLANDS \n-- and Buttercup, barreling along, controlling her horse easily. \nGRANDFATHER (off-screen) Despite Humperdinck's reassurance that she would grow to love him, the only joy she found was in her daily ride. \nCUT TO: \nA WOODED GLEN - CLOSE TO SUNDOWN \nLovely, quiet, deserted. Buttercup suddenly reins in. \nVOICE A word, my lady? \nCUT TO: \nTHREE MEN, standing close together in the path. Beyond them can be seen the waters of Florin Channel. The three men are not your everyday commuter types. Standing in front is a tiny man with the most angelic face. He is Sicilian and his name is VIZZINI. Beside him is a Spaniard, erect and taut as a blade of steel. His name is INIGO MONTOYA. Beside him is a giant. His name is FEZZIK. \nVIZZINI We are but poor, lost circus performers. Is there a village nearby? \nBUTTERCUP There is nothing nearby; not for miles. \nVIZZINI Then there will be no one to hear you scream- \nHe nods to the giant, Fezzik, who merely reaches over, touches a nerve on Buttercup's neck, and the start of a scream is all she manages --unconsciousness comes that fast. As she starts to fall -- \nCUT TO: \nA TINY ISOLATED SPOT AT THE EDGE OF FLORIN CHANNEL \nA sailboat is moored. It's dusk now, shadows are long. Inigo, the Spaniard, busies himself getting the boat ready. \nCUT TO: \nThe giant Fezzik carries Buttercup, unconscious, on board. \nVizzini rips some tiny pieces of fabric from an army jacket and tucks them along the saddle of Buttercup's horse. There is about the entire operation a sense of tremendous skill and precision. \nINIGO What is that you're ripping? \nVIZZINI (not stopping or turning) It's fabric from the uniform of an Army officer of Guilder. \nFEZZIK Who's Guilder? \nVIZZINI (pointing straight out) The country across the sea. The sworn enemy of Florin. (slaps the horse's rump) Go! \nThe horse takes off. They start for the boat. \nVIZZINI Once the horse reaches the castle, the fabric will make the Prince suspect the Guilderians have abducted his love. When he finds her body dead on the Guilder frontier, his suspicions will be totally confirmed. \nFEZZIK You never said anything about killing anyone. \nINIGO, FEZZIK, AND VIZZINI squinting back, trying desperately to see. At this moment, they are all holding their breaths. \nCUT TO: \nTHE DARKNESS BEHIND THEM \nAnd there's still nothing to be seen. It's still ominous. Only now it's eerie too. \nThen -- \nThe moon slips through and -- \nInigo was right -- something is very much there. A sailboat. Black. With a great billowing sail. Black. It's a good distance behind them, but it's coming like hell, closing the gap. \nCUT TO: \nINIGO, FEZZIK, AND VIZZINI \nstaring at the other boat. \nVIZZINI (explaining with as much logic as he can muster) Probably some local fisherman out for a pleasure cruise at night through eel-infested waters. \nAnd now as a sound comes from their boat they turn as we \nCUT TO: \nBUTTERCUP, diving into the water, starting to swim away. \nCUT TO: \nTHE BOAT \nand Vizzini screaming. \nVIZZINI Go in, get after her! \nINIGO I don't swim. \nFEZZIK (to the unasked question) I only dog paddle. \nVIZZINI Veer left. Left. Left! \nCUT TO: \nBUTTERCUP \nstill close to the boat, switching from a crawl to a silent breast stroke. The wind dies and as it does, something new is heard. A not-too-distant high-pitched shrieking sound. Buttercup stops suddenly, treads water. \nCUT TO: \nTHE BOAT \nVIZZINI Do you know what that sound is, Highness? Those are the Shrieking Eels -- if you doubt me, just wait. They always grow louder when they're about to feed on human flesh. \nCUT TO: \nBUTTERCUP, treading water, still not far from the boat. The shrieking sounds are getting louder and more terrifying. Buttercup stays silent. \nCUT TO: \nTHE BOAT \nVIZZINI If you swim back now, I promise, no harm will come to you. I doubt you will get such an offer from the Eels. \nCUT TO: \nBUTTERCUP, and she's a gutsy girl. The shrieking sound is louder still, but she doesn't make a sound. Behind her now, something dark and gigantic slithers past. \nShe's scared, sure, petrified, who wouldn't be, but she makes no reply -- \n-- and now a SHRIEKING EEL has zeroed in on her -- \n-- and now she sees it, a short distance away, circling, starting to close -- \n-- and Buttercup is frozen, trying not to make a movement of any kind -- \n-- and the Eel slithers closer, closer -- \n-- and Buttercup knows it now, there's nothing she can do, it's over, all over -- \n-- and now the Eel opens its mouth wide, and it's never made such a noise, and as its great jaws are about to clamp down -- \nGRANDFATHER (off-screen) She doesn't get eaten by the Eels at this time. \nAnd the second we hear him: \nCUT TO: \nTHE SICK KID'S ROOM \nThe Kid looks the same, pale and weak, but maybe he's gripping the sheets a little too tightly with his hands. \nTHE KID What? \nGRANDFATHER The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous. \nTHE KID Well, I wasn't nervous. \nCUT TO: \nTHE CLIFFS \nThe rope goes all the way to the top. \nCUT TO: \nINIGO \nhurrying to FEZZIK. He straps a harness to him, then lifts Buttercup and Vizzini in the harness. Finally, he himself gets in the harness. All three are strapped to FEZZIK like papooses. \nAnd he starts to ascend the rope, carrying them all along with him as he goes. \nCUT TO: \nTHE MAN IN BLACK, sailing in toward the Cliffs of Insanity, watching as FEZZIK rises swiftly through the first moments of dawn. \nCUT TO: \nTHE TOP OF THE CLIFFS - LOOKING DOWN \nFEZZIK'S GROUP is only faintly visible far below. This is the first time we've gotten the real vertigo feeling and it's a gasper. \nCUT TO: \nFEZZIK CLIMBING ON. Buttercup is almost out of her mind with fear. \nCUT TO: \nTHE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE CLIFFS \nFEZZIK is moving right along; however high they are, he's already over a third of the way done. \nCUT TO: \nTHE MAN IN BLACK \nleaping from his ship to the rope, starting to climb. He's impossibly far behind, but the way he goes you'd think he didn't know that because he is flying up the rope, hand over hand like lightning. \nCUT TO: \nVIZZINI AND THE OTHERS \nINIGO (looking down) He's climbing the rope. And he's gaining on us. \nVIZZINI Inconceivable! \nHe prods FEZZIK, who nods, increases his pace. \nCUT TO: \nTHE MAN IN BLACK \nroaring up the rope, and \nCUT TO: \nLONG SHOT - THE CLIFFS \n-- and the Man In Black is cutting deeply into FEZZIK's lead. \nCUT TO: \nVIZZINI AND THE OTHERS \nVIZZINI (shrieking) Faster! \nFEZZIK I thought I was going faster. \nVIZZINI You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains. \nFEZZIK Well, I'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself. \nVIZZINI (cutting through) -- I do not accept excuses. (shaking his head) I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all. \nFEZZIK (hurt) Don't say that, Vizzini. Please. \nAnd his arms begin moving much more slowly. \nCUT TO: \nTHE MAN IN BLACK \nHis arms still work as before. If anything, he has speeded up. FEZZIK's lead is smaller and smaller \nCUT TO: \nTHE VIEW FROM THE TOP OF THE CLIFFS \nMaybe a hundred feet for FEZZIK to go. Maybe more. \nCUT TO: \nVIZZINI AND THE OTHERS, and it's getting too close now. \nVIZZINI Did I make it clear that your job is at stake? \nHe watches them depart, then turns, peers down over the Cliffs. He watches a moment, then paces, shaking his hands loose. He practices a few of his honed fencing skills. He is a taut and nervous fellow, and has never been one for waiting around. \nCUT TO: \nTHE MAN IN BLACK \nclimbing on. He must be six inches closer to the top than when last we saw him. Inigo is watching. \nCUT TO: \nINIGO \nwalking away. Finally he goes back to cliff edge, starts to talk. It's instant death if the Man In Black falls, but neither gives that possibility much credence. This is our two heroes meeting. They don't know it yet; but that's what it is. \nINIGO (hollering down) Hello there. \nThe Man In Black glances up, kind of grunts. \nINIGO Slow going? \nMAN IN BLACK Look, I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks. So I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me. \nINIGO Sorry. \nMAN IN BLACK Thank you. \nInigo steps away, draws his sword, loosens up with a few perfect thrusts. Then resheathes and looks eagerly over the edge again. \nINIGO I do not suppose you could speed things up? \nMAN IN BLACK (with some beat) If you're in such a hurry, you could lower a rope, or a tree branch, or find something useful to do. \nINIGO I could do that. In fact, I've got some rope up here. But I do not think that you will accept my help, since I am only waiting around to kill you. \nMAN IN BLACK That does put a damper on our relationship. \nHe finds another bold a few inches higher. \nINIGO But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top. \nMAN IN BLACK That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait. \nINIGO I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard. \nMAN IN BLACK No good. I've known too many Spaniards. \nAnd he just hangs there in space, resting, gathering his strength. \nINIGO You don't know any way you'll trust me? \nMAN IN BLACK Nothing comes to mind. \nAnd on these words, CAMERA ZOOMS into a CLOSE UP on Inigo. He raises his right hand high, his eyes blaze, and his voice takes on a tone we have not heard before. \nINIGO I swear on the soul of my father, Domingo Montoya, you will reach the top alive. \nCUT TO: \nTHE MAN IN BLACK. \nThere is a pause. Then, quietly: \nMAN IN BLACK Throw me the rope. \nCUT TO: \nINIGO \nHe dashes to the giant rock the rope was originally tied to. \nCUT TO: \nTHE MAN IN BLACK \nas his grip loosens a moment, trying to cling to the side of the cliff. \nCUT TO: \nINIGO \nnow with a small coil of rope, hurries back to the edge and hurls it over -- \nCUT TO: \nTHE ROPE \nIt hangs close to the Man In Black. He releases the rocks, grabs the rope, hangs helplessly in space a moment, then looks up at Inigo and -- \nCUT TO: \nINIGO \nstraining, forcing his body away from the cliff edge and -- \nCUT TO: \nTHE MAN IN BLACK \nAnd he shifts his style now. \nMAN IN BLACK (coping as best he can) -- naturally -- (suddenly shifting again) --but I find Thibault cancels out Capo Ferro, don't you? \nThe Man In Black is now perched at the edge of the elevated castle ruin. No where to go, he jumps to the sand. \nInigo stares down at him. \nINIGO Unless the enemy has studied his Agrippa- \nAnd now, with the grace of an Olympian, Inigo flies off the perch, somersaults clean over the Man In Black's head, and lands facing his opponent. \nINIGO -- which I have. \nThe two men are almost flying across the rocky terrain, never losing balance, never coming close to stumbling; the battle rages with incredible finesse, first one and then the other gaining the advantage, and by now, it's clear that this isn't just two athletes going at it, it's a lot more that that. This is two legendary swashbucklers and they're in their prime, it's Burt Lancaster in \"The Crimson Pirate\" battling Errol Flynn in \"Robin Hood\" and then, incredibly, the action begins going even faster than before as we \nCUT TO: \nINIGO \nAnd behind him now, drawing closer all the time, is the deadly edge of the Cliffs of Insanity. Inigo fights and ducks and feints and slashes and it all works, but not for long, as gradually the Man In Black keeps the advantage, keeps forcing Inigo back, closer and closer to death. \nINIGO (happy as a clam) You are wonderful! \nMAN IN BLACK Thank you -- I've worked hard to become so. \nThe Cliff edge is very close now. Inigo is continually being forced toward it. \nINIGO I admit it -- you are better than I am. \nMAN IN BLACK Then why are you smiling? \nInches from defeat, Inigo is, in fact, all smiles. \nINIGO Because I know something you don't know. \nMAN IN BLACK And what is that? \nINIGO I am not left-handed. \nAnd he throws the six-fingered sword into his right hand and immediately, the tide of battle turns. \nCUT TO: \nTHE MAN IN BLACK \nstunned, doing everything be can to keep Inigo by the Cliff edge. But no use. Slowly at first, he begins to retreat. Now faster, Inigo is in control and the Man In Black is desperate. \nCUT TO: \nINIGO \nand the six-fingered sword is all but invisible now, as he increases his attack, then suddenly switches styles again. \nCUT TO: \nA ROCKY STAIRCASE leading to a turret-shaped plateau, and the Man In Black is retreating like mad up the steps and he can't stop Inigo -- nothing can stop Inigo -- and in a frenzy, the Man In Black makes every feint, tries every thrust, lets go with all he has left. But he fails. Everything fails. He tries one or two final desperate moves but they are nothing. \nMAN IN BLACK You're amazing! \nINIGO I ought to be after twenty years. \nAnd now the Man In Black is smashed into a stone pillar, pinned there under the six fingered sword. \nMAN IN BLACK (hollering it out) There's something I ought to tell you. \nINIGO Tell me. \nMAN IN BLACK I am not left-handed either. \nAnd now he changes hands, and at last, the battle is fully joined. \nCUT TO: \nINIGO \nAnd to his amazement, he is being forced back down the steps. He tries one style, another, but it all comes down to the same thing -- the Man In Black seems to be in control. And before Inigo knows it, the six-fingered sword is knocked clear out of his hand. \nInigo retreats, dives from the stairs to a moss-covered bar suspended over the archway. He swings out, lands, and scrambles to his sword and we \nCUT TO: \nTHE MAN IN BLACK \nwho watches Inigo, then casually tosses his sword to the landing where it sticks in perfectly. Then the Man In Black copies INIGO. Not copies exactly, improves. \nHe dives to the bar, swings completely over it like a circus performer and dismounts with a backflip. \nCUT TO: \nINIGO \nstaring in awe. \nINIGO Who are you?! \nMAN IN BLACK No one of consequence. \nSatisfied by the silence, he starts forward again and as he rounds the bend -- a rock flies INTO FRAME, shattering on a boulder inches in front of him. \nCUT TO: \nFEZZIK \nHe moves into the mountain path. He has picked up another rock and holds it lightly. \nFEZZIK I did that on purpose. I don't have to miss. \nMAN IN BLACK I believe you -- So what happens now? \nFEZZIK We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone. \nMAN IN BLACK You mean, you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword, and we'll try to kill each other like civilized people? \nFEZZIK (gently) I could kill you now. \nHe gets set to throw, but the Man In Black shakes his head, takes off his sword and scabbard, begins the approach toward the Giant. \nMAN IN BLACK Frankly, I think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting. \nFEZZIK It's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest. I don't even exercise. \nHe flips the rock away. \nCUT TO: \nTHE MOUNTAIN PATH AND THE TWO MEN \nThe Man In Black is not now and has never been a shrimp. But it's like he wasn't even there, FEZZIK towers over him so much. \nThere is a moment's pause, and then the Man In Black dives at FEZZIK's chest, slams him several tremendous blows in the stomach, twists his arm severely, slips skillfully into a beautifully applied bear hug, and in general makes any number of terrific wrestling moves. \nFEZZIK just stands there, kind of taking in the scenery. Finally the Man In Black pushes himself away, stares up at the Giant. \nMAN IN BLACK Look are you just fiddling around with me or what? \nFEZZIK I just want you to feel you're doing well. I hate for people to die embarrassed. \nThey get set to begin again. Then suddenly -- \nCUT TO: \nFEZZIK \nas he jumps forward with stunning speed for anyone his size and reaches for the Man In Black who drops to his knees, spins loose, and slips between the Giant's legs. \nFEZZIK You're quick. \nMAN IN BLACK And a good thing too. \nFEZZIK (getting set for another onslaught) Why do you wear a mask? Were you burned by acid, or something like that? \nMAN IN BLACK Oh no. It's just that they're terribly comfortable. I think everyone will be wearing them in the future. \nFEZZIK considers this a moment, then attacks, and if he moved quickly last time, this time he is blinding and as the Man In Black slips down to avoid the charge, FEZZIK moves right with him, only instead of twisting free and jumping to his feet, this time the Man In Black jumps for FEZZIK's back and in a moment he is riding him, and his arms have FEZZIK's throat, locked across FEZZIK's windpipe, one in front, one behind. The Man In Black begins to squeeze. Tighter. \nFEZZIK (standing, talking as he does so) I just figured out why you give me so much trouble. \nCUT TO: \nFEZZIK \nas he charges toward a huge rock that lines the path, and just as he reaches it he spins his giant body so that the entire weight of the charge is taken by the Man In Black. \nCUT TO: \nTHE MAN IN BLACK \nAnd the power of the charge is terrible, the pain enormous, but he clings to his grip at FEZZIK's windpipe. \nMAN IN BLACK (his arms never leave Fezzik's throat) Why is that, do you think? \nFEZZIK (his voice just beginning to get a little strained) Well, I haven't fought just one person for so long. I've been specializing in groups. Battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing. \nCUT TO: \nANOTHER HUGE ROCK ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PATH \nAgain FEZZIK charges, slower this time, but still a charge, and again he spins and creams the Man In Black against the rough boulder. \nCUT TO: \nTHE MAN IN BLACK \nAnd the punishment is terrible, and for a moment it seems as if he is going to let go of Fezzik's windpipe and crumble, but he doesn't, he holds on. \nMAN IN BLACK Why should that make such a difference? \nFEZZIK Well ... (And now his voice is definitely growing weaker) ... you see, you use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one. \nAgain FEZZIK slams the Man In Black against a boulder, only this time his power has diminished and Fezzik starts to slowly collapse. \nCUT TO: \nFEZZIK \nMAN IN BLACK Really? In that case, I challenge you to a battle of wits. \nVIZZINI For the Princess? \nThe Man In Black nods. \nVIZZINI To the death? \nAnother nod. \nVIZZINI I accept. \nMAN IN BLACK Good. Then pour the wine. \nAs Vizzini fills the goblets with the dark red liquid, the Man In Black pulls a small packet from his clothing, handing it to Vizzini. \nMAN IN BLACK Inhale this, but do not touch. \nVIZZINI (doing it) I smell nothing. \nMAN IN BLACK (taking the packet back) What you do not smell is called iocane powder. It is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man. \nVIZZINI Hmm. \nCUT TO: \nVIZZINI \nwatching excitedly as the Man In Black takes the goblets, turns his back. A moment later, he turns again, faces Vizzini, drops the iocane packet. It is now empty. \nThe Man In Black rotates the goblets in a little shell game maneuver then puts one glass in front of Vizzini, the other in front of himself. \nMAN IN BLACK All right: where is the poison? The battle of wits has begun. It ends when you decide and we both drink, and find out who is right and who is dead. \nVIZZINI But it's so simple. All I have to do is divine from what I know of you. Are you the sort of man who would put the poison into his own goblet, or his enemy's? \nHe studies the Man In Black now. \nVIZZINI Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. I'm not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But you must have known I was not a great fool; you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me. \nMAN IN BLACK (And now there's a trace of nervousness beginning) You've made your decision then7 \nVIZZINI Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. \nMAN IN BLACK Truly, you have a dizzying intellect. \nVIZZINI Wait till I get going! Where was I? \nMAN IN BLACK Australia. \nVIZZINI Yes -- Australia, and you must have suspected I would have known the powder's origin, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me. \nMAN IN BLACK (very nervous) You're just stalling now. \nVIZZINI (cackling) You'd like to think that, wouldn't you? (stares at the Man in Black) You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong. So, you could have put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But, you've also bested my Spaniard which means you must have studied. And in studying, you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me. \nAs Vizzini's pleasure has been growing throughout, the Man In Black's has been fast disappearing. \nMAN IN BLACK You're trying to trick me into giving away something -- it won't work -- \nVIZZINI (triumphant) It has worked -- you've given everything away -- I know where the poison is. \nMAN IN BLACK (fool's courage) Then make your choice. \nVIZZINI I will. And I choose -- \nAnd suddenly he stops, points at something behind the Man In Black. \nVIZZINI -- what in the world can that be? \nCUT TO: \nTHE MAN IN BLACK \nturning around, looking. \nMAN IN BLACK What? Where? I don't see anything. \nCUT TO: \nVIZZINI \nbusily switching the goblets while the Man In Black has his head turned. \nVIZZINI Oh, well, I-I could have sworn I saw something. No matter. \nThe Man In Black turns to face him again. Vizzini starts to laugh. \nMAN IN BLACK What's so funny? \nVIZZINI I'll tell you in a minute. First, let's drink -- me from my glass, and you from yours. \nAnd he picks up his goblet. The Man In Black picks up the one in front of him. As they both start to drink, Vizzini hesitates a moment. \nThen, allowing the Man In Black to drink first, he swallows his wine. \nMAN IN BLACK You guessed wrong. \nBUTTERCUP (stares at him) I know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything. \nThe Man In Black says nothing. \nBUTTERCUP You're the Dread Pirate Roberts; admit it. \nMAN IN BLACK (bowing) With pride. What can I do for you? \nBUTTERCUP You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces. \nMAN IN BLACK Hardly complimentary, Your Highness. Why loose your venom on me? \nCLOSE UP - BUTTERCUP, quietly now. \nBUTTERCUP You killed my love. \nCUT TO: \nTHE MAN IN BLACK \nwatching her closely. \nMAN IN BLACK It's possible; I kill a lot of people. Who was this love of yours? Another Prince, like this one, ugly, rich, and scabby? \nBUTTERCUP No. A farm boy. Poor. Poor and perfect, with eyes like the sea after a storm. \nCUT TO: \nBUTTERCUP \nAnd probably, if she did not hate Roberts so, there would be tears. \nBUTTERCUP On the high seas, your ship attacked, and the Dread Pirate Roberts never takes prisoners. \nMAN IN BLACK (explaining as a teacher might) I can't afford to make exceptions. Once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time. \nBUTTERCUP You mock my pain! \nMAN IN BLACK Life is pain, Highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something. I remember this farm boy of yours, I think. This would be, what, five years ago? \nButtercup nods. \nMAN IN BLACK Does it bother you to hear? \nBUTTERCUP Nothing you can say will upset me. \nMAN IN BLACK He died well, that should please you. No bribe attempts or blubbering. He simply said, \"Please. Please, I need to live.\" It was the \"please\" that caught my memory. (MORE) \nMAN IN BLACK (CONT'D) I asked him what was so important for him. \"True love,\" he replied. And then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness. I can only assume he meant you. You should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are. \nBUTTERCUP And what am I? \nMAN IN BLACK Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead? \nBUTTERCUP You mocked me once, never do it again -- I died that day! \nThe Man In Black is about to reply as they stand there on the edge of the sheer ravine. But then something catches his attention and as he stares at it briefly, \nCUT TO: \nHIS P.O.V.: \nThe dust cloud caused by Humperdinck's HORSES is rising up into the sky. \nCUT TO: \nBUTTERCUP \nand while his attention is on the dust cloud, rising high, she pushes him with all the strength she has. \nBUTTERCUP You can die too, for all I care!! \nCUT TO: \nTHE MAN IN BLACK \nteetering on the ravine edge, for a moment, then he begins to fall. Down goes the Man In Black. \nDown, down, rolling, spinning, crashing always down toward the flat rock floor of the ravine. \nCUT TO: \nBUTTERCUP \nstaring transfixed at what she has wrought. \nThere is a long pause. She stands there, alone, as from far below the words come to her, drifting on the wind -- \nMAN IN BLACK ... as ... you ... wish... \nBUTTERCUP Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I done? \nAnd without a second thought or consideration of the dangers, she starts into the ravine. A moment later, she too is falling, spinning and twisting, crashing and torn, cartwheeling down toward what is left of her beloved. \nCUT TO: \nTHE DUST CLOUD \nButtercup is clearly panicked and maybe Westley is too, but he moves jauntily along, sword in hand. \nWESTLEY It's not that bad. I'm not saying I'd like to build a summer home here, but the trees are actually quite lovely. \nTHE GIANT TREES, thick and black-green, look ominous as hell and they shield all but intermittent stripes of sun. \nA GIANT SPURT OF FLAME leaps up, preceded by a slight popping sound, and this particular spurt of flame misses Westley, but Buttercup is suddenly onfire; at least the lower half of her is and -- \nCUT TO: \nWESTLEY \ninstantly forcing Buttercup to sit, gathering her flaming hem in his hands, doing his best to suffocate the fire. This isn't all that easy and it causes him a bit of grief, but he does his best to sound as jaunty as before. \nWESTLEY Well now, that was an adventure. \nHe examines where the flames burst over her. \nWESTLEY Singed a bit, were you? \nBUTTERCUP (She wasn't and she shakes her head \"no\") You? \nHe was, and he shakes his head \"no.\" As he pulls her to her feet -- \nCUT TO: \nTHE SWAMP FLOOR \n-- and as there's another popping sound, \nCUT TO: \nWESTLEY GRABBING BUTTERCUP \npulling her aside to safety as another great spun of flame suddenly shoots up. \nWESTLEY Well, one thing I will say. The Fire Swamp certainly does keep you on your toes. \nButtercup is frozen with fear. He takes her hand, gently leads her forward as we- \nCUT TO: \nTHE TWO OF THEM \nmoving slowly along through a particularly dangerous part of the Fire Swamp. \nIt's later now, the sun slants down at a slightly different angle. \nWESTLEY (happily) This will all soon be but a happy memory because Roberts' ship \"Revenge\" is anchored at the far end. And I, as you know, am Roberts. \nBUTTERCUP But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago? \nWESTLEY I myself am often surprised at life's little quirks. \nThere is again a popping sound, then a huge spurt of flame. Westley simply picks up Buttercup as they walk along, moves her out of danger, puts her back down, goes right on talking without missing a beat. \nWESTLEY You see, what I told you before about saying \"please\" was true. It intrigued Roberts, as did my descriptions of your beauty. \nCUT TO: \nSOME HIDEOUS VINES -- \nthey look like they could be flesh eating. Westley takes his sword, slices a path for them to follow. The vines groan as they fall. He's been chatting away the entire time. \nWESTLEY Finally, Roberts decided something. He said, \"All right, Westley, I've never had a valet. You can try it for tonight. I'll most likely kill you in the morning.\" Three years he said that. \"Good night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I'll most likely kill you in the morning.\" It was a fine time for me. I was learning to fence, to fight, anything anyone would teach me. And Roberts and I eventually became friends. And then it happened. \nBUTTERCUP What? -- go on -- \nWestley picks her up, carrying her across some swamp water that is bridged by a narrow, rickety tree branch. \nWESTLEY Well, Roberts had grown so rich, he wanted to retire. So he took me to his cabin and told me his secret. \"I am not the Dread Pirate Roberts,\" he said. \"My name is Ryan. I inherited this ship from the previous Dread Pirate Roberts, just as you will inherit it from me. The man I inherited it from was not the real Dread Pirate Roberts, either. (MORE) \nWESTLEY (CONT'D) His name was Cummerbund. The real Roberts has been retired fifteen years and living like a king in Patagonia.\" Then he explained the name was the important thing for inspiring the necessary fear. You see, no one would surrender to the Dread Pirate Westley. \nThe two of them have by now crossed the pond. \nWESTLEY So we sailed ashore, took on an entirely new crew and he stayed aboard for awhile as first mate, all the time calling me Roberts. Once the crew believed, he left the ship and I have been Roberts ever since. Except, now that we're together, I shall retire and hand the name over to someone else. Is everything clear to you? \nButtercup, perplexed, is about to reply but the ground she steps on gives way -- it's Lightning Sand -- a great patch of it, and it has her -- a cloud of powder rises and she sinks into the stuff crying Westley's name but then she is gone as we -- \nCUT TO: \nWESTLEY WHIRLING \nslashing at a U-shaped vine, hacks it in half -- it's still connected to the tree. Then be grabs it, drops his sword, and, clutching the other end of the vine, he dives into the lightning sand and there is another cloud of white powder, but it settles quickly. \nNow nothing can be seen. Nothing at all. Just the lightning sand, lovely and lethal. \nHOLD ON THE LIGHTNING SAND -- THEN -- \nAn odd panting sound is heard now. The panting sound is suddenly very loud. And then a giant R.0.U.S. darts into view. The R.0.U.S. -- a Rodent of Unusual Size -- is probably no more than eighty pounds of bone and power. It sniffs around a bit then, as quickly as it has come, it goes. \nCUT TO: \nTHE LIGHTNING SAND \nas Westley, lungs long past the bursting point, explodes out; he has Buttercup across his shoulders and as he pulls to the edge of the lightning sand pit, using the vine -- \nTHE FAR EDGE OF THE FIRE SWAMP \nBeyond, a beach. \nCUT TO: \nBUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY \nBUTTERCUP (almost in disbelief) We did it. \nWESTLEY Now, was that so terrible? \nAnd from somewhere they summon strength, pick up their pace, and as they reach the edge of the Fire Swamp -- \nCUT TO: \nSOMETHING WE HADN'T EXPECTED: \nHumperdinck on his horse, Rugen beside him. THREE WARRIORS, armed and ready, are mounted in formation behind. Buttercup and Westley are at the edge of the Fire Swamp, about to leave it. They stop. Buttercup looks beyond exhaustion. Westley looks worse. \nHUMPERDINCK Surrender! \nIt's dusk. Behind Humperdinck are the waters of the bay. \nCUT TO: \nWESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP \nstaring out at the others. \nWESTLEY You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept. \nHUMPERDINCK I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool. \nWESTLEY Ah, but how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time. So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit. \nHUMPERDINCK I tell you once again -- surrender! \nWESTLEY It will not happen! \nCUT TO: \nBUTTERCUP \nlooking from one to the other; then something else catches her eye and we -- \nCUT TO: \nAN ARMED WARRIOR \nin shadow, with a loaded crossbow aimed at Westley's heart. \nCUT TO: \nBUTTERCUP \nlooking the other way -- \nCUT TO: \nANOTHER WARRIOR \ncrossbow aimed at Westley. \nHUMPERDINCK (roaring) For the last time -- SURRENDER! \nWESTLEY (roaring right back, bigger) DEATH FIRST!! \nCUT TO: \nBUTTERCUP \nfrantically staring around, and now \nCUT TO: \nA THIRD WARRIOR \ncrossbow stretched, ready to shoot; this one is hidden in a tree blocking any escape Westley might try. \nBUTTERCUP Will you promise not to hurt him? \nCUT TO: \nHUMPERDINCK \nwhirling to face her. \nHUMPERDINCK What was that? \nCUT TO: \nWESTLEY \nwhirling to face her. \nWESTLEY What was that? \nwith numbers ranging from a low of \"1\" to a high of \"50.\" Rugen goes to it. \nRUGEN This being our first try, I'll use the lowest setting. \nAnd he turns the dial to \"1\". \nCUT TO: \nWESTLEY \nHe has suction cups on his head now, on his temple, on his heart, his hands and feet. He says nothing, keeps control of himself \nCUT TO: \nCOUNT RUGEN \nfiddling with his Machine a moment more. And then he opens the flood gate, water pours down the chute, turning the wheel, which in turn really gets The Machine going. \nCUT TO: \nWESTLEY \nand he's lying on the table, and he's only flesh and the chains are metal and thick, but such is his desperation it almost seems he might break them. A terrible sound comes from his throat, an incessant gasping. It keeps on coming as we finally \nCUT TO: \nCOUNT RUGEN \nHe switches off The Machine, picks up a large notebook and pen, sits in a chair. The NOISE of The Machine subsides. Rugen opens the book to a blank page. \nRUGEN As you know, the concept of the suction pump is centuries old. Well, really, that's all this is. Except that instead of sucking water, I'm sucking life. I've just sucked one year of your life away. I might one day go as high as five, but I really don't know what that would do to you. So, let's just start with what we have. What did this do to you? Tell me. And remember, this is for posterity, so be honest -- how do you feel? \nAND NOW, AT LAST: \nCUT TO: \nWESTLEY \nin anguish so deep it is dizzying. Helpless, he cries. \nCount Rugen watches the tears, then starts to write. \nRUGEN Interesting. \nCUT TO: \nHUMPERDINCK \nin his quarters, swamped. Piles of papers are strewn all over. Now YELLIN, a pale, shifty, quick-eyed man appears in the doorway. \nHUMPERDINCK Yellin. \nYELLIN (bows, then kneels) Sire. \nHUMPERDINCK As Chief Enforcer of all Florin, I trust you with this secret: killers from Guilder are infiltrating the Thieves' Forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night. \nYELLIN My spy network has heard no such news. \nCUT TO: \nBUTTERCUP \nentering. \nBUTTERCUP Any word from Westley? \nCUT TO: \nTHE PRINCE AND YELLIN \nturning to her in the doorway. \nHUMPERDINCK Too soon, my angel. Patience. \nBUTTERCUP He will come for me. \nHUMPERDINCK Of course. \nAs she glides out-- \nHUMPERDINCK She will not be murdered. On the day of the wedding, I want the Thieves' Forest emptied and every inhabitant arrested. \nYELLIN Many of the thieves will resist. My regular enforcers will be inadequate. \nHUMPERDINCK Form a Brute Squad then. I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed. \nYELLIN It won't be easy, Sire. \nHUMPERDINCK (alone, exhausted) Try ruling the world sometime. \nCUT TO: \nTHE THIEVES' FOREST - DAY \nA lot of hollering is going on. The THIEVES are being rounded up by the BRUTE SQUAD, a large group of large men. Yellin stands on a wagon in the midst of all the scuffling. \nGRANDFATHER (off-screen) The day of the wedding arrived. The Brute Squad had their hands full carrying out Humperdinck's orders. \nINIGO -- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go -- \nFEZZIK -- where? \nINIGO To find the Man in Black, obviously. \nFEZZIK But you don't know where he is. \nINIGO (he is possessed by demons now) Don't bother me with trifles; after twenty years, at last, my father's soul will be at peace. \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE UP - INIGO \nINIGO (big) There will be blood tonight!! \nCUT TO: \nPRINCE HUMPERDINCK'S CHAMBERS \n-- strewn with maps, etc. Yellin enters, and kneels. \nHUMPERDINCK (sharpening his dagger) Rise and report. \nYELLIN The Thieves' Forest is emptied. Thirty men guard the castle gate. \nHUMPERDINCK Double it. My Princess must be safe. \nYELLIN The gate has but one key, and I carry that. \nHe shows the key, dangling from a chain around his neck. Just at that moment, Buttercup enters. \nHUMPERDINCK Ah! My dulcet darling. Tonight we marry. Tomorrow morning, your men will escort us to Florin Channel where every ship in my armada waits to accompany us on our honeymoon. \nBUTTERCUP Every ship but your four fastest, you mean. \nThe Prince looks at her blankly for a moment. \nBUTTERCUP Every ship but the four you sent. \nHUMPERDINCK Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four. \nYELLIN (bows, exits) Your Majesties. \nCUT TO: \nBUTTERCUP \nstaring at Humperdinck. \nBUTTERCUP You never sent the ships. Don't bother lying. It doesn't matter. Westley will come for me anyway. \nHUMPERDINCK (sharply) You're a silly girl. \nBUTTERCUP Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear. \nHUMPERDINCK (close to erupting; speaks very distinctly) I-would-not-say-such things-if- Iwere-you- \nBUTTERCUP Why not? You can't hurt me. Westley and I are joined by the bonds of love. And you cannot track that. Not with a thousand bloodhounds. And you cannot break it. Not with a thousand swords. And when I say you are a coward, that is only because you are the slimiest weakling ever to crawl the earth. \nCUT TO: \nHUMPERDINCK \njumping at her, yanking her by the hair, starting to pull her along, out of control, his words indistinct. \nHUMPERDINCK IWOULDNOTSAYSUCHTHINGSIFIWEREYOU! \nCUT TO: \nA CORRIDOR OF THE CASTLE \nas the Prince throws open the door to Buttercup's room, slams it shut, locks it, breaks into a wild run and -- \nCUT TO: \nWESTLEY IN THE MACHINE \nbut it's not on. Count Rugen is adding more notes to his book. He looks up as the Prince suddenly comes down the steps, raging. \nHUMPERDINCK (at Westley) You truly love each other, and so you might have been truly happy. Not one couple in a century has that chance, no matter what the storybooks say. And so I think no man in a century will suffer as greatly as you will. \nAnd with that he whirls, turns on The Machine, grabs the lever and -- \nCUT TO: \nCOUNT RUGEN \ncalling out -- \nRUGEN Not to fifty!!! \nBut it's too late as we -- \nCUT TO: \nPRINCE HUMPERDINCK \nVALERIE \"True love.\" He said, \"true love,\" Max. My God -- \nMIRACLE MAX (retreating) Don't say another word, Valerie. \nVALERIE (turning to Inigo and Fezzik) He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered. \nMIRACLE MAX Why'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name -- \nVALERIE (pursuing him now) What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck. Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck \nMIRACLE MAX (holding his hands over his ears) I'm not listening. \nVALERIE A life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help -- \nMIRACLE MAX Nobody's hearing nothing! \nVALERIE Humperdinck. Humperdinck! Humperdinck! \nINIGO -- But this is Buttercup's true love -- If you heal him, he will stop Humperdinck's wedding. \nVALERIE Humperdinck. Humperdinck -- \nMIRACLE MAX (to Valerie) Shut up -- (now to Inigo) Wait. Wait. I make him better, Humperdinck suffers? \nINIGO Humiliations galore! \nMIRACLE MAX That is a noble cause. Give me the sixty-five, I'm on the job. \nAnd as Valerie shrieks excitedly we \nCUT TO: \nTHIS LUMP \nIt is somewhat smaller than a tennis ball. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL MAX AND VALERIE, exhausted, looking at the lump with beautific pleasure, as Valerie, cooking utensil in hand, covers the thing with what looks like chocolate. Inigo and FEZZIK stare at the thing too, but more dubiously. \nINIGO (a little appalled) That's a miracle pill? \nMax nods. \nVALERIE (finishing) The chocolate coating makes it go down easier. But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. And you shouldn't go swimming after, for at least, what? \nMIRACLE MAX An hour. \nVALERIE Yeah, an hour. \nMIRACLE MAX A good hour. Yeah. \nInigo accepts the pill as FEZZIK takes Westley, who is stiff as a board now. \nINIGO (heading out the door, Fezzik close behind) Thank you for everything. \nMIRACLE MAX Okay. \nVALERIE (waving after them) Bye-bye, boys. \nMIRACLE MAX Have fun storming the castle. \nVALERIE (to Max) Think it'll work? \nMIRACLE MAX It would take a miracle. Bye! \nVALERIE Bye. \nAnd as they wave, trying to look happy we -- \nCUT TO: \nFEZZIK, INIGO, AND WESTLEY \non the top of the outer wall of the castle. They look down to the front gate of the castle. The sixty Brutes are visible. \nFEZZIK is thunderstruck by how many Brutes there are. Upset, he turns to Inigo, who is concentrating unsuccessfully, trying to prop Westley against the wall. \nFEZZIK Inigo -- there's more than thirty -- \nINIGO (absolutely unfazed) What's the difference? (indicating the half- dead Westley) We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him. \nFEZZIK Has it been fifteen minutes? \nINIGO We can't wait -- the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand. \nDuring this, FEZZIK, using all his strength, has managed to get Westley into a right angled sitting position, while Inigo brings out the miracle pill. \nINIGO Tilt his head back. Open his mouth. \nFEZZIK (following orders) How long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works? \nCUT TO: \nINIGO \nPill in hand, he drops it into Westley's mouth. \nINIGO Your guess is as good as mine -- \nCUT TO: \nBUTTERCUP \nin her bridal gown, and she's incredible. It's not just her beauty; there's a tranquillity about her now. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nThe Prince, fastening a pearl necklace around her. \nHUMPERDINCK You don't seem excited, my little muffin. \nBUTTERCUP Should I be? \nHUMPERDINCK Brides often are, I'm told. \nBUTTERCUP (gently, confidently) I do not marry tonight. \nCUT TO: \nBUTTERCUP \nand she couldn't seem more serene. \nBUTTERCUP My Westley will save me. \nCUT TO: \nHER WESTLEY \nlooking down on the gate with Inigo and Fezzik. \nCUT TO: \nTHE MAIN GATE OF THE CASTLE \n-- and Yellin, standing there, flanked by his sixty Brutes. \nCUT TO: \nWESTLEY AND INIGO AND FEZZIK \nlooking out at the enemy. This is it. Inigo and FEZZIK shake hands. \nWestley can't even do that, but after a bit of rocking back and forth, he manages to get enough momentum to catapult his arm over and onto his friend's. \nCUT TO: \nAN ABSOLUTELY GEM-LIKE LITTLE CHAPEL \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nThe most intelligent looking, the most impressive appearing CLERGYMAN imaginable. \nButtercup and Humperdinck kneel before the Clergyman. Behind them sit the mumbling old KING AND QUEEN. Standing in the back is Count Rugen. \nFOUR GUARDS are in position flanking the chapel door. \nIMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN (clears his throat, begins to speak) Mawidge...mawidge is what bwings us togewer today... \nHe has an impediment that would stop a clock. \nIMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN Mawidge, the bwessed awwangement, that dweam wiffim a dweam... \nAnd now, from outside the castle, there begins to come a commotion. And then-- \nYELLIN (off-screen) Stand your ground, men. Stand your ground. \nCUT TO: \nTHE BRUTES AND YELLIN \nby the gate, for it is indeed they who are making the commotion, frightened, pointing. \nYELLIN Stand your ground. \nCUT TO: \nTHEIR P.O.V.: \nAnd it is a bit unnerving -- a GIANT seems to be floating toward them out of the darkness, a Giant in a strange cloak, and with a voice that would crumble walls. \nFEZZIK (deep and booming) I AM THE DREAD PIRATE ROBERTS. THERE WILL BE NO SURVIVORS. \nCUT TO: \nFEZZIK \nand he seems to be floating because he's standing in the wheelbarrow, as Inigo, hidden behind him, busts a gut by pushing it and supporting Westley. \nINIGO Now? \nWESTLEY Not yet. \nCUT TO: \nTHE GIANT FLOATING CLOSER \nWESTLEY There's a shortage of perfect breasts in this world. It would be a pity to damage yours. \nAnd Buttercup whirls as we -- \nCUT TO: \nWESTLEY \nlying on the bed. Yellin's sword is beside him. His voice sounds just fine, but he does not move. \nButtercup leaps to the bed, covering him with kisses. Westley is helpless. \nBUTTERCUP Oh, Westley, darling. (more kisses) Westley, why won't you hold me? \nWESTLEY (gently) Gently. \nBUTTERCUP At a time like this that's all you can think to say? \"Gently?\" \nWESTLEY (not so gently) Gently!! \nAnd she lets go, thumping his head against the headboard and \nCUT TO: \nCOUNT RUGEN \nlooking very much surprised. \nRUGEN Good heavens. Are you still trying to win? \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nInigo, struggling feebly, pulling the dagger from his stomach. Holding the wound with his left hand. \nRugen is pushing off from the table, sword in hand, moving in to kill Inigo. \nRUGEN You've got an overdeveloped sense of vengeance. It's going to get you into trouble some day. \nInigo watches the Count approach, and the Count flicks his sword at Inigo's heart, and there's not much Inigo can do, just kind of vaguely parry the thrust with the six-fingered sword and Count Rugen's blade sinks deeply into Inigo's left shoulder. \nInigo doesn't seem to feel it, his other agonies are so much worse. \nCUT TO: \nTHE COUNT \nstepping back, going for the heart again. \nCUT TO: \nINIGO \nAnd as this blow comes he's trying to use the wall for support in forcing himself to his feet, and it's not a roaring success of an attempt, but he does at least make some progress, and again he manages to parry the thrust, as this time Rugen's sword runs through his right arm. Again, Inigo doesn't seem to mind, doesn't even feel it. \nCUT TO: \nCOUNT RUGEN \nstepping back forj ust a moment, watching as Inigo continues to inch his way to his feet and then, just before the Count is about to strike again, Inigo manages a little flick of his own and Rugen hadn't expected it, and he jumps back, makes a little involuntary cry of surprise and \nCUT TO: \nINIGO \nslowly pushing away from the wall. \nINIGO (all but audible) Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father; prepare to die. \nCUT TO: \nCOUNT RUGEN \nsuddenly going into a fierce attack, striking with great power and precision for he is a master swordsman, and he forces Inigo easily back, drives him easily into the wall. But he does not penetrate Inigo's defense. None of the Count's blows get home. As the Count steps back a moment -- \nCUT TO: \nINIGO \npushing slowly off from the wall again. \nINIGO (a little louder) Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die. \nCUT TO: \nTHE COUNT \nAnd again he attacks, slashing with wondrous skill. But none of his blows get through and, slowly, Inigo, again moves forward. \nINIGO (a little louder still) Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die. \nRUGEN Stop saying that! \nCUT TO: \nCOUNT RUGEN \nretreating more quickly around the table. \nHUMPERDINCK That may be the first time in my life a man has dared insult me. \nCUT TO: \nWESTLEY \nlying there comfortably, his words quiet at first. \nWESTLEY It won't be the last. To the pain means the first thing you lose will be your feet, below the ankles, then your hands at the wrists, next your nose. \nCUT TO: \nHUMPERDINCK \ngripping his sword, watching. \nHUMPERDINCK -- and then my tongue, I suppose. I killed you too quickly the last time, a mistake I don't mean to duplicate tonight. \nWESTLEY I wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right -- \nHUMPERDINCK (takes step forward) -- and then my ears, I understand. Let's get on with it \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE UP: WESTLEY HUGE \nWESTLEY Wrong! Your ears you keep, and I'll tell you why -- \nCUT TO: \nHUMPERDINCK \nAnd now he stops, and the look that was in his eyes at the wedding, that look of fear, is starting to return. \nWESTLEY -- so that every shriek of every child at seeing your hideousness will be yours to cherish -- every babe that weeps at your approach, every woman who cries out, \"Dear God, what is that thing?\" will echo in your perfect ears. (MORE) \nWESTLEY (CONT'D) That is what \"to the pain\" means. It means I leave you in anguish, wallowing in freakish misery forever. \nCUT TO: \nHUMPERDINCK \ndoing his best to hide the fear that keeps building inside him. \nHUMPERDINCK I think you're bluffing -- \nCUT TO: \nWESTLEY \nlying there, staring at him. \nWESTLEY It's possible, pig -- I might be bluffing -- it's conceivable, you miserable vomitous mass, that I'm only lying here because I lack the strength to stand -- then again, perhaps I have the strength after all. \nAnd now, slowly, Westley begins to move. His body turns, his feet go to the floor, he starts to stand -- \nCUT TO: \nHUMPERDINCK \nstaring, eyes wide. \nCUT TO: \nWESTLEY \nAnd now he is standing, sword in fighting position. \nWESTLEY (slow and determined) DROP-YOUR-SWORD. \nCUT TO: \nPRINCE HUMPERDINCK \nand he's so panicked he doesn't know whether to pee or wind his watch. He throws his sword to the floor. \nWESTLEY (to Humperdinck) Have a seat. \nCUT TO: \nWESTLEY \nspeaking to Buttercup as Humperdinck sits. \nWESTLEY Tie him up. Make it as tight as you like. \nAnd as she sets to work -- \nCUT TO: \nINIGO \nentering, looking around. \nINIGO Where's Fezzik? \nWESTLEY I thought he was with you. \n", "test1_input": "He studies Westley, whose face is almost sad. \nCUT TO: \nBUTTERCUP \nand her face is sad. Pallid, perhaps ill. She wanders down a corridor in Florin Castle. As she moves unseeing past an intersecting corridor: \nCUT TO: \nPRINCE HUMPERDINCK AND COUNT RUGEN \nwatching her. \nHUMPERDINCK She's been like that ever since the Fire Swamp. (looks at Rugen) It's my father's failing health that's upsetting her. \nRUGEN (unbelieving) Of course. \nAs they move on-- \nCUT TO: \nFLORIN CASTLE - NIGHT \nCAMERA HOLDS ON IT while we hear the Grandfather's voice reading. \nGRANDFATHER (off-screen) The King died that very night, and before the following dawn, Buttercup and Humperdinck were married. \nCUT TO: \nMAIN SQUARE OF FLORIN CASTLE \nAnd if we thought it was packed before, we didn't know how many more could fit in this courtyard. Humperdinck, Rugen and the Queen stand high on the balcony. \nGRANDFATHER (off-screen) And at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen. \nHUMPERDINCK My father's final words were... \nTHE KID (off-screen) -- hold it. Hold it, Grandpa. \nAnd the scene FREEZES, Humperdinck caught in mid-sentence. \nCUT TO: \nTHE KID'S ROOM \nThe Kid is half sitting now, not strong yet, but clearly stronger than when we first saw him. \nTHE KID You read that wrong. She doesn't marry Humperdinck, she marries Westley. I'm just sure of it. After all that Westley did for her, if she does not marry him, it wouldn't be fair. \nGRANDFATHER Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair. \nTHE KID I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right! \nGRANDFATHER Do you want me to go on with this? \nTHE KID Yes. \nGRANDFATHER All right, then. No more interruptions. (starts to read again) ... at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen. \nAnd on these words-- \nCUT TO: \nPRINCE HUMPERDINCK \nHUMPERDINCK My father's final words were \"love her as I loved her, and there will be joy.\" I present to you your Queen. Queen Buttercup. \nAnd on his words-- \nCUT TO: \nTHE CROWD \nand it's gigantic. \nCUT TO: \nTHE ARCHWAY \nwe saw before, as Buttercup emerges. \nCUT TO: \nTHE CROWD \nsuddenly going to its knees, wave after wave of silent KNEELING PEOPLE. All of them down. \nCUT TO: \nBUTTERCUP \ntouched as before, but then she seems stunned as we \nCUT TO: \nTHE CROWD \n", "test1_true": "BUTTERCUP Why do you do this? \nANCIENT BOOER Because you had love in your hands, and you gave it up. \nBUTTERCUP (distraught) But they would have killed Westley if I hadn't done it. \nANCIENT BOOER Your true love lives and you marry another -- (to the crowd) -- True love saved her in the Fire Swamp, and she treated it like garbage. And that's what she is, the Queen of Refuse! So, bow down to her if you want. Bow to her. Bow to the Queen of Slime, the Queen of Filth, the Queen of Putrescence. Boo! Boo! Rubbish! Filth! Slime! Muck! Boo! Boo! \nShe advances on Buttercup now, who is more and more panicked. \nCLOSE-UP - THE ANCIENT BOOER \nLouder and louder and LOUDER she shrieks vituperation at Buttercup, reaching out her old hands toward Buttercup's throat, and Buttercup is as frightened now as Dorothy was when the Witch went after her in \"The Wizard of Oz\", and suddenly, \nCUT TO: \nBUTTERCUP \ncoming out of her nightmare, alone in her castle bedroom. As she frantically grabs a robe and starts to run. \nGRANDFATHER (off-screen, still reading) It was ten days till the wedding. The King still lived, but Buttercup's nightmares were growing steadily worse. \nTHE KID (off-screen) See? Didn't I tell you she'd never marry that rotten Humperdinck? \nGRANDFATHER (off-screen) -- yes, you're very smart. Shut-Up. \nCUT TO: \nBUTTERCUP \nbursting into the Prince's chambers. Count Rugen stands nearby. \nBUTTERCUP It comes to this: I love Westley. I always have. I know now I always will. If you tell me I must marry you in ten days, please believe I will be dead by morning. \nCUT TO: \nPRINCE HUMPERDINCK \nJust stunned. Finally, softly, he begins to talk. \nHUMPERDINCK I could never cause you grief; consider our wedding off. (to Rugen) You returned this Westley to his ship? \nRUGEN Yes. \nHUMPERDINCK Then we will simply alert him. (to Buttercup now) Beloved, are you certain he still wants you? After all, it was you who did the leaving in the Fire Swamp. Not to mention that pirates are not known to be men of their words. \nBUTTERCUP My Westley will always come for me. \nHUMPERDINCK I suggest a deal. You write four copies of a letter. I'll send my four fastest ships. One in each direction. The Dread Pirate Roberts is always close to Florin this time of year. We'll run up the white flag and deliver your message. If Westley wants you, bless you both. If not ... please consider me as an alternative to suicide. Are we agreed? \nAnd she nods -- \nCUT TO: \nA VERY THICK GROVE OF TREES \nThe trees are unusual in one respect: all of them are extraordinarily heavily knotted. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nHumperdinck and Rugen, walking into the grove of trees. \nRUGEN Your Princess is really a winning creature. A trifle simple, perhaps, but her appeal is undeniable. \nHUMPERDINCK Oh, I know. The people are quite taken with her. It's odd, but when I hired Vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day, I thought that was clever. But it's going to be so much more moving when I strangle her on our wedding night. Once Guilder is blamed, the nation will be truly outraged. They'll demand we go to war. \nThey are deeper into the grove now. Rugen is searching around. \nRUGEN Now, where is that secret knot? It's impossible to find. (Finding the knot on the tree he hits it, and it opens, revealing a staircase leading underground.) Are you coming down into the Pit? Westley's got his strength back. I am starting him on The Machine tonight. \nHUMPERDINCK Tyrone, you know how much I love watching you work. But, I've got my country's five hundredth anniversary to plan, my wedding to arrange, My wife to murder, and Guilder to frame for it. I'm swamped. \nRUGEN Get some rest -- if you haven't got your health, you haven't got anything. \nRugen smiles and hurries down the stairs as the tree slides back perfectly into place. \nCUT TO: \nAN ENORMOUS THING \nWe can't tell quite what it is or what it does, but somehow it is unsettling. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nCount Rugen, dragging Westley up alongside the thing -- Levers and wheels and wires, you name it, it's there. \nRUGEN Beautiful, isn't it? \nThe Albino starts attaching suction cups to Westley. \nRUGEN It took me half a lifetime to invent it. I'm sure you've discovered my deep and abiding interest in pain. At present I'm writing the definitive work on the subject. So I want you to be totally honest with me on how The Machine makes you feel. \nCUT TO: \nA DIAL \n", "test1_id": 3036, "test2_input": "as Inigo, eyes shut tight, walks forward, the great sword held in his hands. \nFezzik, frightened, follows close behind. \nCUT TO: \nTHE SECRET KNOT \nthat reveals the staircase. \nCUT TO: \nINIGO \nwalking blind through the grove of trees. He moves to the Secret Knot, hesitates, then moves past it. \nThen Inigo stops. For a long moment he stands frozen. Suddenly he whirls, eyes still closed, and the sword strikes home dead center into a knot and -- \nNothing. He has failed. \nIn utter despair he collapses against the tree. Against a knot in the tree. Against THE KNOT in the tree. It slides away, revealing the staircase. FEZZIK and Inigo look at each other, then start down. \nCUT TO: \nWESTLEY \ndead by The Machine. FEZZIK leans over him, listening for a heartbeat. Then he looks at Inigo, shakes his head. \nFEZZIK He's dead. \nInigo is in despair. For a moment, he just sags. \nINIGO (barely able to speak) It just is not fair. \nTHE KID (off-screen) -- Grandpa, Grandpa -- wait -- \nCUT TO: \nTHE KID'S ROOM \nHe is terribly excited and looks stronger than we've yet seen him. \nTHE KID -- wait -- what did FEZZIK mean, \"He's dead?\" I mean he didn't mean dead. \nThe Grandfather says nothing, just sits there. \nTHE KID Westley's only faking, right? \nGRANDFATHER You want me to read this or not? \nCUT TO: \nTHE KID: CLOSE UP \nTHE KID Who gets Humperdinck? \nGRANDFATHER I don't understand. \nTHE KID Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At the end, somebody's got to do it. Is it Inigo? Who? \nGRANDFATHER Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives. \nTHE KID You mean he wins? Jesus, Grandpa! What did you read me this thing for? \nAnd he desperately fights for control. \nGRANDFATHER You know, you've been very sick and you're taking this story very seriously. I think we better stop now. \nHe closes the book and starts to get up. \nTHE KID (shaking his head) No! I'm okay. I'm okay. (gestures toward the chair) -- sit down. All right? \nGRANDFATHER Okay. (sitting and opening the book again) All right, now, let's see. Where were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of Despair. \nCUT TO: \nINIGO, IN DESPAIR \nWe're back in the Pit, the same shot as before. For a moment, he just sags. \nINIGO Well, we Montoyas have never taken defeat easily. Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body. \nFEZZIK The body? \nINIGO (not stopping) Have you any money? \nFEZZIK I have a little. \nINIGO I just hope it's enough to buy a miracle, that's all. \nAs Fezzik takes the corpse, follows Inigo up the stairs -- \nCUT TO: \nA HOVEL - DUSK \nInigo, FEZZIK, Westley approach the door. They knock. From inside the hovel a little man's voice is heard. If Mel Brooks' Year Old Man was really old, he'd resemble this guy. \n", "test2_true": "Inigo pounds again. \nMIRACLE MAX (opening a small window in the door) What? What? \nINIGO Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years? \nMIRACLE MAX The King's stinking son fired me. And thank you so much for bringing up such a painful subject. While you're at it, why don't you give me a nice paper cut and pour lemon juice on it? We're closed! \nHe shuts the window. They rap on the door. \nMIRACLE MAX (opening the window) Beat it or I'll call the Brute Squad. \nFEZZIK I'm on the Brute Squad. \nMIRACLE MAX (looking at the Giant) You are the Brute Squad. \nINIGO We need a miracle. It's very important. \nMIRACLE MAX Look, I'm retired. And besides, why would you want someone the King's stinking son fired? I might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle. \nINIGO He's already dead. \nMIRACLE MAX (for the first time, interested) He is, eh? I'll take a look. Bring him in. \nHe unlocks the door and lets them in. \nCUT TO: \nINIGO AND FEZZIK \nhurrying inside. FEZZIK carries Westley who is just starting to stiffen up a little. He lays Westley down across a bench by the fireplace, picks Westley's arm up and lets it drop limp. \nMIRACLE MAX I've seen worse. \nHe studies Westley a moment, checking here, checking there. \nINIGO Sir. Sir. \nMIRACLE MAX Hah? \nINIGO We're really in a terrible rush. \nMIRACLE MAX (He takes nothing from nobody) Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money? \nINIGO Sixty-five. \nMIRACLE MAX Sheesh! I never worked for so little, except once, and that was a very noble cause. \nINIGO This is noble, sir. (pointing to Westley, remorseful) His wife is crippled. His children are on the brink of starvation. \nMIRACLE MAX Are you a rotten liar. \nINIGO I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years. \nMIRACLE MAX Your first story was better. (looking around) Where's that bellows? (spots it) He probably owes you money, huh? Well, I'll ask him. \nHe goes to get a huge bellows. \nINIGO (stupefied) He's dead. He can't talk. \nMIRACLE MAX Look who knows so much. Well, it just so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead. There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Please open his mouth. \nInigo does. Max inserts the bellows in Westley's mouth and starts to pump. \nMIRACLE MAX Now, mostly dead is slightly alive. Now, all dead...well, with all dead, there's usually only one thing that you can do. \nINIGO What's that? \nHe stops pumping. \nMIRACLE MAX Go through his clothes and look for loose change. \nHe starts pumping again. \nMIRACLE MAX (to Westley) Hey! Hello in there. Hey! What's so important? What you got here that's worth living for? \nAnd he presses lightly on Westley's chest. \nWESTLEY ... tr ... oooo .... luv... \nEverybody stares at Westley lying there on the bench. \nINIGO True love. You heard him. You could not ask for a more noble cause than that. \nMIRACLE MAX Sonny, true love is the greatest thing in the world. Except for a nice MLT, a mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwich, where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe. They're so perky, I love that. But that's not what he said. He distinctly said \"to blave.\" And, as we all know, \"to blave\" means \"to bluff.\" So you're probably playing cards, and he cheated \nA WOMAN'S VOICE -- Liar -- LIAR-LI-A-A-AR -- \nVALERIE, an ancient fury, storms out of a back room and toward \nMIRACLE MAX -- get back, witch -- \nVALERIE I'm not a witch, I'm your wife.

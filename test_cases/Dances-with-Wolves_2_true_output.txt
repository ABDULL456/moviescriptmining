DUNBAR (V.O.) Though only two days it seems like a week. I am missing the company of my new friends. I can see all of their faces, but somehow it is not enough. Tomorrow, I will make an unannounced visit. After all, they are my neighbors, what can it hurt? 
EXT. BLUFF - NIGHT 
Two Socks has taken his dinner and retreated to the shadows. He munches contentedly until a strange sound jolts him to attention. 
At the fort is an odd sight. Dunbar is dancing around the fire, occasionally singing out an energetic whoop. 
Two Socks is caught up in the scene and lets out a howl of his own. It could be the stone age. 
EXT. BLUFF - NIGHT 
The silhouettes of three Indians are watching the strange performance below. One of them is Wind In His Hair. Down below Dunbar continues to dance. 
EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY 
There is nothing for miles. 
Cisco and Dunbar are walking toward us. His boots are pretty worn and his striped trousers have faded to almost nothing. The breastplate shines in the sun. His rifle lies in the crook of his arm, Indian style. 
Dunbar twists around on Cisco and looks back across the prairie. He calls out. 
DUNBAR Go home. 
Dunbar watches a moment to see if he's done any good, then turns forward with a sour look. 
DUNBAR Damn him. 
Dunbar makes his way through a small, grassy valley borders by rolling slopes. He looks across the prairie. Two Socks is about fifty yards out, trotting parallel to Cisco and Dunbar. 
Exasperated Dunbar pulls Cisco up and slides off. Two Socks sits, waiting and watching. 
EXT. BLUFF - DAY 
Far down in the valley the figure of Lieutenant Dunbar is striding through the grass. He looks angry. When he's within a few feet of Two Socks, Dunbar waves his arms and stamps a foot Two Socks scurries to one side but doesn't go far. 
DUNBAR C'mon Two Socks... you can't go... so go home. 
Dunbar repeats his shooing motion and the wolf hops a few feet. 
DUNBAR Alright then, don't go home. But stay... stay right here. 
Dunbar turns away and as he does a long, low and mournful howl swells behind him. He looks back. Two Socks muzzle is high in the air and one eye is trained on Dunbar hoping for a good reaction. 
Like an angry father who's had too much, Dunbar charges Two Sock with a roar. 
DUNBAR You go home. 
The wolf races away this time and Dunbar immediately runs for Cisco, hoping to reach his horse and ditch Two Socks. But he's running long before the wolf comes bouncing alongside. Dunbar weaves out at him, startling Two Socks. He sidles away but as he does the lieutenant reaches out and gives the base of his tail a good hard squeeze. 
It might as well be a firecracker. Tow Socks gives a yelp and shoots off with his tail tucked. Dunbar laughs out loud. He watches until the wolf has gone a fair distance without sign of slowing down. 
Then still chuckling to himself, he turns once again and starts for Cisco at a trot. But moments later, something grabs at one of his ankles, the lieutenant's legs tangle and he goes down face first into the grass. 
Dunbar's lying on his belly. Not knowing what hit him, he rolls onto his side for a closer look. There's Two Socks, sitting in the grass a few feet back. Dunbar sits up cross- legged and smiles at his old friend. 
Two Socks catches something suddenly, perhaps from a shift in the wind, and starts to slink away. Dunbar peers over the grass up at the bluff. It's Stone Calf, Kicking Bird and Wind In His Hair. 
EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY 
The Indian entourage is riding slowly toward Lieutenant Dunbar. Stone Calf is at Kicking Bird's side. 
STONE CALF You were right about loo ten tant -- he is a special white man. 
Kicking Bird watches Dunbar as he replies. 
KICKING BIRD Yes, he is special... he should have a real name. 
EXT. INDIAN VILLAGE - DAY 
Lieutenant Dunbar's arrival this day is different from the ones which have gone before. 
Young mounted warriors have ridden out to swarm around him, but they're full of good cheer reserved for a special friend. There's much backslapping and a few of them lean in to shake hands as they have seen him do. 
But some of the men have chosen to remain in front of their lodges. Their expressionless faces anything but friendly. None of this is lost on Wind In His Hair. He has the look of a secret service man watching a president, as the parade moves through the village. 
EXT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAY 
The escorts dismount and so does the lieutenant. Smiles A Lot suddenly comes forward and grasps Cisco's reins. There's a brief tug of war. But before it gets out of hand, Kicking Bird is reassuring Dunbar with calm words and a smile, with the lieutenant watching, the boy takes Cisco's muzzle between his hands and blows breath into each nostril. He too gives Dunbar a reassuring smile. 
In the next moment, the lieutenant finds himself being gently pushed into Kicking Bird's lodge. 
As Kicking Bird is about to duck in behind him, a hand on his arm stops him. It is Wind In His Hair and his tone is strong with friendly advice. 
WIND IN HIS HAIR Not everyone thinks it is a good idea that he is here. 
KICKING BIRD I know. 
Wind In His Hair turns to the people that have gathered about. 
WIND IN HIS HAIR Kicking Bird has business with the white man. Let him do it. 
INT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAY 
Kicking Bird's pipe is a beautiful piece of work. It's being smoked. 
Kicking Bird puffs away a few times and hands the pipe to Dunbar. The lieutenant, aware that the pipe is something special, handles it with care. 
He looks to Kicking Bird for guidance as he puts his mouth to the tip. The medicine man reassures him with a wave of the hand and Dunbar begins to puff. 
Dunbar coughs lightly at the harsh tobacco but he smokes well, watching the bowl pulse with life at each puff. 
He stops now and lowers the pipe. He stares down. The pipe seems almost alive as it lays in his hands.

STEW 
All right, outside! 
DAWSON 
(bewildered) 
I beg your pardon, sir? 
STEW 
(gesturing violently) 
Outside! 
The valet gazes at Stew as if he thinks the man is insane. He is considerably alarmed. 
DAWSON 
I think I understand, sir. You mean you want me to go? 
STEW 
(smiling admiringly) 
There you are. You caught on. You see, you're nice and you're smart too. You caught on right away. Outside! Go on! Outside! And don't come back! 
131. MEDIUM SHOT 
The valet starts edging toward the door. 
DAWSON 
No, sir. No! 
Stew's eyes bulge as he notices the birdcage for the first time. 
STEW 
Wait a minute, what's this? 
INSERT: Birdcage. 
BACK TO SCENE: 
DAWSON 
That's a canary, sir. 
STEW 
That's a canary! Who brought that in here? Canary, huh? Go on, get that out of here. Get that out of here! 
DAWSON 
(frightened) 
Yes, sir. Very good, sir. 
STEW 
(ranting) 
A bird! A bird in a gilded cage! Get that thing out of here! 
DAWSON 
Yes sir! 
The valet hurries off, carrying the birdcage. As he nears the door, there is a light tap on the door connecting Stew's room and Anne's. The door opens and Anne comes in, wearing a ravishing and revealing negligee. She carries a small jeweler's box in her hand. She crosses the room toward Stew. 
ANNE 
Good morning, darling. 
She looks over and sees Dawson at the hall door. 
ANNE 
Oh, Dawson, see that all Mr. Smith's clothes go to the cleaners this morning, please, will you? 
The valet bows. Stew looks at her blankly. 
DAWSON 
Very good, madame. 
He closes the door discreetly and goes out. 
132. CLOSER SHOT - ANNE AND STEW 
As they hug. 
STEW 
Say, who is this mug? 
Anne sits down on the rumpled bed. 
ANNE 
I've got a present. Shut your eyes. Keep 'em closed. I know you're going to love them. 
STEW 
(eyes closed, feeling the package) 
Little - couldn't be an automobile, could it? 
(he opens the package) 
Well, well! Ain't that nice! 
He holds them up - expensive garters. 
ANNE 
Do you like them? 
STEW 
Got my initials on them too. They're cute. They're nice little things - what do you do with them? 
ANNE 
You wear them of course, silly. 
STEW 
Oh no. No, no. Not me. I haven't worn these things for Years. 
ANNE 
I know that. 
STEW 
Besides I'd look foolish. I couldn't look Gallagher in the face. 
ANNE 
Darling, I don't care whether you can look Gallagher in the face or not, but you're gonna be a good boy and wear garters. 
STEW 
Honey, I love you. I'll eat spinach for you. I'll go to the dentist twice a year for you. I'll wash behind my ears for you. But I will never wear garters! 
His arms go about Anne. Under the force of his embrace Anne sinks back on the pillows. Stew leans forward looking down at her. 
133. CLOSE TWO SHOT - STEW AND ANNE 
Nose to nose. 
ANNE 
(adopting a sing-song)

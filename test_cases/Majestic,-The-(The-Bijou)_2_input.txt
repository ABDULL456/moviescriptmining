INT.  DOC LARDNER'S PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY 
Lardner is on the phone, sipping his coffee and nibbling his bear claw.  Pete is standing, nosing around the office -- diplomas, photographs, knick-knacks.  He zeros in on one photo in particular. 
ON THE PHOTO 
one of Lardner and a beautiful YOUNG WOMAN.  They've been fishing, and the young woman displays a much larger catch than Lardner. 
LARDNER (into phone) Stanton found him by the wash.  Not hurt too bad, but he took a nasty bump on the head and he can't remember who he is.  We both think he looks familiar, but we can't place him.  You bet.  He'll be here. 
Lardner hangs up and watches Pete looking at the pictures. 
LARDNER That's me and my daughter Adele. My pride and joy.  Charms the fish right out of the lake, she does. 
PETE She's very pretty. 
LARDNER Thanks.  Well, Sheriff's on his way over, and maybe we can get to the bottom of who you are... 
Lardner stares at him.  Pete takes note, turns toward him. 
LARDNER ... sorry 'bout that, but you do look familiar to me. 
PETE Wish I could say the same thing.

EXT.  DOC LARDNER'S OFFICE - DAY 
The Sheriff's sedan pulls up to the office and SHERIFF CECIL ELDRIDGE, 45, gets out.  As he gets a few steps from the door, Harry Trumbo jumps out from around the side of the building and stops him. 
HARRY (excited) Cecil!  Cecil, there's a young man in there... 
ELDRIDGE (startled) Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office? 
HARRY Listen to me!  The young man in there... 
Eldridge keeps moving to the door. 
ELDRIDGE (interrupting) Stan Lawson found him unconscious by the wash this morning, and I'm here to investigate, and if we find anything interesting, it'll be in the paper, so why don't you just... 
Harry jumps in front of Eldridge and grabs him by the shoulders. 
HARRY Cecil, listen to me! 
The sheriff stops. 
HARRY (breathless) It's Luke.

INT.  DOC LARDNER'S PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY 
Sheriff Eldridge is seated across from Pete.  He's staring at him intently.  Silence. 
ELDRIDGE No wallet, huh? 
LARDNER No identification at all. (beat) What're you thinkin', Cecil? 
ELDRIDGE What I'm thinkin' is we got us one a'two things here.  A mystery or a damn miracle.  And by god I can't tell which. (to Pete) Boy, you say you have no idea who you are?  That right? 
PETE Yes. 
ELDRIDGE You ever been in this town before, to your knowledge? 
PETE No.  But... 
ELDRIDGE But what? 
PETE Well, this place sorta reminds me of something. 
ELDRIDGE What's that? 
PETE "It's a Wonderful Life." 
ELDRIDGE The Jimmy Stewart picture?  I remember that one.  Saw it over at the Bijou.  So, you remember that, huh? 
PETE "It's a Wonderful Life?" 
ELDRIDGE Or the Bijou.  Either one. 
PETE I remember the picture... but I don't remember where I saw it. 
The Sheriff rises and crosses to the door. 
ELDRIDGE Doc, with your permission, I want to bring someone in here.  Maybe it'll jar this young man's memory. 
LARDNER By all means. 
Eldridge opens the door. 
ELDRIDGE (to someone offscreen) Harry, why don't you come on in here. 
Harry enters the office, doffs his hat, revealing a full head of snow-white hair.  He nods to Eldridge and Lardner, and slowly turns to face Pete.  He looks closer... and closer. Hesitantly, he takes a couple of steps towards Pete, who slowly rises out of his chair to meet the old man's gaze. Finally, they're standing practically toe-to-toe. 
PETE 
looks a bit puzzled, but the old man has such a sweet face...

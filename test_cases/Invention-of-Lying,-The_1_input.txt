BLONDE WE'RE GOING TO LIVE! We're going to live! Thank you! Thank you! 
The blonde falls onto the bed in exhaustion. 
BLONDE This has been the worst... and the best... day of my life. 
MARK Okay, I gotta go. 
BLONDE Oh no, please stay. We've been through so much together. 
Mark stares at this helpless girl for a moment. 
MARK I'm an asshole. 
The blonde's face and mood do an instant 180. 
BLONDE (SPITEFUL) Well, I hate assholes. Get out of here. 
The blonde chucks her shoes at Mark as he closes the door. 
EXT. MOTEL -- DAY 
Mark walks across the parking lot. A look of total shock on his face. 
INT. BAR - DUSK 
Greg is in the exact same position Mark left him in, but he's twice as drunk. 
Mark plops down next to him, dazed and upset. 
MARK That was one of the worst experiences of my life. 
GREG (SHIT-FACED) Did you invent a new kind of bike? 
MARK What else would you do if you could do anything in the world? 
GREG Bone chicks asses. That's what I'd do. 
MARK What else though. What's the second thing you'd do. 
Greg nods off. Mark nudges him. 
GREG What else would you do, dipshit? 
MARK I'd get money. I'd get all the money. 
Greg passes out. Mark nods his head, takes the three full shots sitting in front of Greg and does them all. 
MARK Yeah. Let's do that. Greg, let's go. 
GREG What? 
MARK We're going on a trip. 
Greg immediately perks up. 
GREG I'll drive. 
INT. MARK'S CAR -- NIGHT 
Greg is driving, Mark rides shotgun, both of them are completely plastered. 
MARK Thanks for driving man, I'm completely plastered. 
GREG I'm just as hammered as you. But I don't care if I get arrested. I'm trying to hit bottom. 
WHOOP-WHOOP come the flashing lights of a cop car right behind them. Greg begins to pull over. 
GREG Here comes bottom. 
Mark looks worried. The cop comes to Greg's window. 
COP Nothing safer than pulling over two nerdy white guys in their forties. 
GREG I don't want to go to jail. 
COP Are you drunk? 
GREG Yes.

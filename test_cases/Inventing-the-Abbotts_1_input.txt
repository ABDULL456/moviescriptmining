PAMELA Sorry about what?

DOUG You always do this to me. 
PAMELA You said you weren't sorry and now you say you are. So maybe I'm not sure what you're sorry about? 
DOUG I'm sorry for what I'm supposed to be sorry about. Okay? 
PAMELA You're sorry for feeling me up? 
DOUG (embarrassed) Oh, shit, come on, Pam. Dammit. For crying out loud. Forget it. 
PAMELA I accept your apology.   Let's dance. 
Doug allows Pam to pull him out onto the dance floor. He feels like a dolt, but she arranges his hands on her and they begin to dance. She gazes into his eyes and smiles: 
PAMELA Hi. 
DOUG Hi. 
Pam is in love with Doug, she has been since they were children. Doug is mellowed by his tender feelings for her. For a golden minute they are in pleasurable bubble of true affinity. But their bubble begins to deflate as Doug sees Joan Abbott staring at them. Her disapproval is unmistakable. Doug steers Pam around the dance floor to avoid Joan's eyes, but then he sees Lloyd Abbott. Lloyd's stare is even more discomforting. Pamela senses the change in Doug's mood, but she is unaware of the cause. 
PAMELA Is Jacey home for the summer or is he just here for a visit? 
The mention of his brother's name at this exact moment sends a chill down Doug's spine.

DOUG Home for the summer. (slight beat) It's cheaper if he stays here for the summer. He can save more money for school, 'cause he doesn't have to pay rent. Money's tight, you know, we're sort of poor. 
PAMELA You're not poor, are you? 
DOUG Hell -- you kidding? Even with Jacey working summers, my mom had to borrow against the house so he could go to Penn. I don't know where the money'll come from for me to go to college. 
Doug sees Joan Abbott prompting Ted to cut in on his dance with Pamela. Doug's bitterness swells. 
DOUG I hear Alice and Peter are getting a divorce. 
PAMELA They're just separated. 
DOUG What's the difference? 
PAMELA I don't know, you'll have to ask them. 
DOUG So, where's Eleanor tonight? 
PAMELA Eleanor's... just not here. 
DOUG Is she pregnant? 
PAMELA No!    Who said that?

DOUG I don't know, everybody in town is saying something different -- she got knocked up, she ran away, your old man kicked her out. So, which is it? 
Ted steps over and taps Doug on the shoulder. 
DOUG Fuck off. 
Ted is taken aback.   Pamela's eyes fill with tears. 
PAMELA Why do you hate me so much? 
TED Excuse me, asshole, but... 
Doug spins and slugs Ted in the jaw -- sending him reeling into the other dancers. Everyone pulls away from Doug and Pam. Doug massages his fist and looks helplessly at Pamela: 
DOUG I don't hate you. 
70     INT. HOLT HOME - DOUG'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT            70 
The hall light is on but the bedroom is dark. Doug lies on his bed (still dressed). Jacey appears in the doorway. 
JACEY You asleep? 
DOUG Nope. 
71     EXT. HOLT HOME - GARAGE - NIGHT (SHORT TIME LATER)            71 
Doug and Jacey play another hard fought game of ping-pong in the garage. In the midst of a volley Doug says:

They enter like gunslingers in a saloon.  The four elves, who are twice their size, turn and face them. Teemo draws his small dagger.  With confidence he smiles at Rool. 
TEEMO Watch this.  Right between the eyes. 
ROOL (to the elves) He never misses. 
Artfully Teemo poises the dagger above his head.  With all his might he throws.  His dagger flip-flops through the air and lands at the elves' feet, plink-plunk. 
TEEMO Ooops.  Was that right?  That wasn't right. 
Suddenly the entire wall implodes.  The elves scream and panic as Willow comes crashing in like King Kong. He grabs the crying baby and tucks her under his arm. 
EXT. ELF HOLE - DAY 
The brownies scamper out of a hole in the ground where the elves keep their vultures corralled. 
ROOL/TEEMO Hyah!  Hyah!  Git! 
They untie th evulture and send them flapping away in the forest as Willow wiggles out of the elf hole with the baby.  They run for their lives. 
EXT. FOREST - CHASE - DAY 
Rool and teemo tear along at incredible speed, Willow barely keeping up with them.  Little elf arrows shower the forest as the angry elves chase after them, whoop- ing and screaming. 
EXT. DEEP GORGE - DAY 
They skid up to a perilously deep drop into oblivion. The elves are shrieking toward them. The only chance of excape is a huge fallen tree spanning the gorge. The brownies scamper out.  Willow looks down and reels with vertigo. 
WILLOW I can't go out there with the baby! 
ROOL/TEEMO (frantically point) Elves!! 
The elf army pours out of the forest.  Willow holds his breath and ventures out onto the topmost branches of the tree.  Arrows zing around him as he wobbles like a drunken tightrope walker toward the middle.  The brown- ies wait for him. 
WILLOW Ohhh, I hate this. 
TEEMO Take your time.  Don't worry about the elves.  They won't come out here. 
WILLOW Why not? 
ROOL Because of the trolls. 
WILLOW Trolls? 
The brownies console Willow with unworried laughter. 
TEEMO Relax.  They only come out at night. 
An ugly TROLL snarls up behind Willow.  They all scream and race for the other side.  Another TROLL pops up to meet them.  The trolls slink along like possums.  The brownies dive through a hole in the hollow tree trunk. 
The elves, meanwhile, flint-start a fire at their end of the tree.  One troll claws at the brownies inside the trunk while the other chases Willow across gangling branches.  Then the baby falls out of the papoose!  She tumbles and catches on a low branch and Willow races the troll and grabs her just before she plummets into the gorge. 
One troll catches Rool but can't then get his claw out of the trunk.  The brownies finally excape.  The tree burns and breaks, dangling over the gorge by its roots. A troll howls as he falls to his death.  The other scrambles up the tree and grabs Willow's foot. Willow's boot slips off and down goes the second troll. 
Flames lick at Willow as he at last hauls himself to safety, just as the roots snap and the blazing tree goes crashing down in the gorge. 
WILLOW This is not going well. 
TEEMO Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do. 
Willow bundles the baby and follows the brownies into the forest.  Hobbling slightly on his bootless foot. 
EXT. MAJESTIC FOREST - SUNSET 
Fading sunlight bleeds through awesomely beautiful trees as Willow and the brownies trek into the magical Fairy Kingdom.  Elora Danan falls into a peaceful sleep. 
EXT. FAIRY KINGDOM - NIGHT 
Willow comes to a halt.  His mouth drops open.  The forest is a luminous Milky Way of dancing, flying FAIRIES, like fireflies.  The brownies tug at his pant-legs and whisper. 
TEEMO Come on.  This is a privilege.  No- body ever gets called before Her Majesty. 
Wonder-struck, Willow walks into a clearing where colorful night-flowers bloom.  He lowers himself onto an enormous toadstool, testing it with his hand.  Other BROWNIES stand watching, like courtiers.  The tiny fairies fly up to Willow's face and giggle:  they look like five-year-old girls, full of mischief and fun. 
Suddenly a strange LIGHT begins to throb behind the trees, peircing the forest with helter-skelter beams. Willow throws up his arms as the bright light stings his eyes. 
ROOL Stand up!  It's the queen! 
CHERLINDREA, the Fairy Queen, materializes out of frag- ments of moving light, diaphanous, sylph-like, beauti- ful. 
CHERLINDREA Willow Ufgood.

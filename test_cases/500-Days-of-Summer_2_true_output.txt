CUT TO: 
LATER. Tom at the bar. He downs his drink in one gulp. 
CUT TO: 
LATER. ANGLE ON Tom alone at the table. The band plays "Lady in Red" and everyone's dancing. When we're back on Tom, he's sitting with Summer. 
TOM Well...glad you came? 
SUMMER Of course. Where am I exactly? 
TOM When you turn 13 in the Jewish religion, you officially become an adult. 
ANGLE ON RACHEL, dancing with a BOY. 
SUMMER Wow. So this is a big day in your sister's life. 
TOM Pretty big, yeah. 
SUMMER (BEAT) So why aren't you smiling? 
ANGLE ON TOM. Alone. Still not smiling. Rachel arrives in the nick of time. 
RACHEL Hey brother. Wanna dance? 
She drags him to the dance floor. 
RACHEL Hi. 
TOM You having fun? You were great this morning. 
RACHEL Yeah yeah yeah. Talk to me. How are you? 
TOM Me? I'm good. I'm great. 
RACHEL (re: Summer's engagement) I heard. 
TOM Yeah. 
RACHEL Sucks. 
TOM Yup. 
It's silent a few beats. 
TOM Anyway, who cares about me? This is your day. 
She hugs him. Tight. He doesn't cry but he could. 
RACHEL You know, my friends... they're all in love with you. 
TOM Is that right? 
RACHEL Look. 
He sees a coven of 13-year olds swooning across the dance floor at him. 
TOM That's nice. 
RACHEL What I tell ya? There are plenty other fish in the sea. 
TOM Those are guppies. 
RACHEL Who knows, someday one might turn out to be your "true love." 
TOM Are you making fun of me now? 
RACHEL No I'm serious. 
TOM I got news for you Rach. That true love stuff... it's make-believe. 
RACHEL Well that's not very romantic. 
TOM It's the new me. 
The song ends. 
TOM Alright... go play with your friends. 
RACHEL You'll be ok?

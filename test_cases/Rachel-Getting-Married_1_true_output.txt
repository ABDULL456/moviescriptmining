The tent is fairly packed now with about 60-SOME ODD PEOPLE. Everybody is getting along fine. With a single dramatic gesture, Norman Sklear silences the band. Upon Norman's instructions, the drummer works his cymbals in such a way that the party-goers realize that something big is about to happen. Norman Sklear now gestures for complete silence and he gets it. Rachel and Emma grin madly at each other. 
SFX: LIVE BRAZILIAN PERCUSSION SLOWLY BUILDING, GROWING LOUDER approaching the tent entrance from the moonlit backyard. ALL EYES ON THE ENTRANCE -- the swimming pool lights shimmering outside as -- 
--FOUR SEXY BRAZILIAN DRUMMERS AND FOUR GORGEOUS BRAZILIAN 
CARNIVAL GIRLS COMPLETE WITH HEADDRESSES AND FEATHERS DANCE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE CROWD! The musicians blow whistles and bang on drums. The cafe-au-lait beauties gyrate and pull guests out of their chairs. 
Rachel leaps from her chair into Sidney's arms and he gives her a huge, sexy kiss as he rubs her tummy. Wedding guests scream with delight and rush to the floor. The drummers become more   impassioned with every beat. They travel allover the dance   floor, a trail of guests behind them. Sweat is dripping,   the girls are glistening wet, the guests are pulled into a   massive pulsing heartbeat on the dance floor. Emma, Kayra and Victoria are dancing together screaming until Cousin Joseph, Matt and another male friend muscle their way in. 
Little kids swing each other around in circles. 
Rachel and Sidney are practically doing it on the dance floor. A Brazilian beauty shimmies over to them, her headdress bobbing, her smile enormous.

Sidney immediately puts his head on her bosom. After a beat Rachel does too, laughing. 
SFX: POUNDING BRAZILIAN DRUMS 
Carol stands quietly besides Paul and takes his hand and whispers to him. Though not dancing, they are clearly enjoying the carnival. Paul gives a little shimmy. Abby and Andrew are huddled together at a table, talking intensely. It's like they are blind to the spectacle. Kieran offers his hand to Kym. She leaps up, spilling her flowers. Kieran pulls her to the middle of the crowd. They circle each other. They come together almost violently and dance like there's no tomorrow. Kym's head is thrown back. Shoulders heaving, Kieran swings her around by the waist. 
SFX: DRUMMERS DRIVING THE PARTY FASTER AND FASTER. Emma shimmies wildly with her partner, her hair a mess. 
Mr. and Mrs. Williams clapping wildly and doing the limbo/hustle/drunken parent dance. Guests stomping and cheering. The brown, glittering dancers are shaking thisclose to the drummers who have their shirts off. 
A dancer rocks with an older gentleman who gulps oxygen from a tank. 
Rachel and Sidney are bathed in sweat, kissing. Sidney is gulping champagne. 
Kieran and Kym have their foreheads together and their eyes closed, chests heaving. 
DRUMS CRESCENDO 
Carol and Paul watching, laughing. Andrew whispering in Abby's ear. She just stares off. 
Kieran and Kym glued together. 
Rachel tossing her hair wildly, Sidney behind her. 
Everyone laughing, laughing, dancing. 
DRUMS STOP!!!

CUT TO: 
76   EXT. BUCHMAN BACKYARD. NIGHT.                               76 
The exotic tent looks beautiful out there in the sprawling backyard, reflections of the POOL LIGHTS shimmering off its sides. The whole backyard is enchanted -- with magically deployed twinkle lights, Japanese lanterns and other special lighting effects adding to the aura... 
"Rachel Loves Sidney" is being played in a mellow, super- romantic trumpet solo mode now by Christian Scott. 
An assorted bunch of guests have relocated to the poolside patio in their finery. The oxygen guy and his matronly wife are seated on a transplanted living room couch, talking intently to a be-feathered headdressed Dancer. Norman Sklear and Emma are sharing a stylish, quietly triumphant slow dance, whispering punctuated by gusts of laughter. Angela Paylin is out there too. Little kids are running around the lawn and a few are playing with OLIVE the Dog. Kym kneels at the far corner of the swimming pool, unnoticed by anyone. A wooden serving tray floats on the surface of the water, supporting a candle wrapped in rice paper. A couple of smaller candles surround the slightly larger one. Kym lights the candles, extinguishes the match, gently slides the illuminated tray out towards the center of the pool, watches. Kym rises and walks towards the house, looking for something. 
NEIGHBORHOOD GIRL (to Kym) I can do a handstand! 
She executes a truly terrible handstand. 
KYM That sucked.

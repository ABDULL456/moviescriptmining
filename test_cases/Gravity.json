{"test1_input": "GRAVITY \nWritten by \nMay 29, 2012 BLACK. \nSILENCE. \nCARD 1 AT 600 KM ABOVE PLANET EARTH THE TEMPERATURE FLUCTUATES BETWEEN 120 AND -100 DEGREES CELSIUS. \nSILENCE. \nCARD 2 THERE IS NOTHING TO CARRY SOUND, NO OXYGEN, AND NO AIR PRESSURE. \nSILENCE. \nCARD 3 LIFE HERE IS IMPOSSIBLE. \nSILENCE. \nTITLE- \nGRAVITY \nBLACK- \nOUTER SPACE, 600 KILOMETERS ABOVE- \nPLANET EARTH. \nLike all images of Earth seen from space, this image of our planet is mythical and majestic. \nThe globe seems almost tangible, slowly spinning, floating in the endless void of space. It is a blue planet, and bright white clouds twirl and stretch in capricious patterns across the deep blue of the oceans and the jigsaw of continents: green, yellow and brown. \nIt is noon in Cape Town and early night in India. \nThe sphere is almost a perfect orb except for the darkened sliver on its Eastern edge. It is beautiful! And so full of life. \nBut not here. \nHere it is completely silent. \nSILENCE- \nIN THE DISTANCE- \nA small metal object crosses the empty space surrounding Earth. If it appears to be a small satellite that is only because it is far away from us. It is the size of one football field. It is- \nThe INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISS). \nIt resembles a dragonfly. Its solar panels stretch out, like wings, from the long body made of connected pressurized modules. \nIt floats with a sense of proud achievement. \nIt orbits at an altitude of 500 km above sea level. It moves at an average of 27,700 kilometers per hour, completing 15.7 laps around the Earth per day. \nIt is cruising over Zimbabwe. To the East, the island of Madagascar. Up to the North, the expansive dry lands of Somalia and Ethiopia. \nSoon, the ISS curves around the spherical planet, and it becomes smaller, almost indistinguishable, no more than a small bright spec grazing over the blue atmosphere. \nCLOSER TO US- \nOrbiting at an altitude of 600 km- \nThe EXPLORER SPACE SHUTTLE becomes visible. \nThis icon of space exploration has played a key role in all of NASA's missions since the late 90's. \nFaintly we hear static, voices murmuring over radio frequences. As the babble bulds we might hear one conversation amongst the REST: \nMISSION CONTROL (On radio, faint) Explorer, please verify that the P1 ATA removal on replacement cap part 1 and 2 are complete. EXPLORER CAP (On radio, faint) DMA M1, M2, M3 and M4 are complete. \nMISSION CONTROL (On radio, faint) Copy that Explorer. Dr Stone-Houston, requesting status update... \nA fizz of static and then the voice continues with sudden, starling clarity. \nRYAN Installation ninety-five percent complete. Running level one diagnostics on circuits, sensors, and power. Standby. \nMISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO) Standing by. Looks like we're on schedule. Dr. Stone, Medical is concerned about your ECG readings. \nRYAN I'm fine Houston. \nMISSION CONTROL (RADIO) Well, medical doesn't agree doctor. Are you feeling nauseous? \n", "test1_true": "MISSION CONTROL (RADIO) That's a date, doctor. Just remember, Houston is partial to Margaritas. \nRYAN OK, here we go... Booting comm card now. Please confirm link. (BEAT) Houston, please confirm reception of data. MISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO) Negative. We're not seeing any data. \nRYAN Stand by, Houston. I'm gonna reboot the comm card. \nMISSION CONTROL (RADIO) Standing by. \nAn ASTRONAUT - MATT KOWALSKI - floats thirty meters away from the Shuttle wearing a bulky white space suit and a full, bubble- like helmet. \nASTRONAUT Houston, I have a bad feeling about this mission. \nMISSION CONTROL Please expand. \nMATT Okay, let me tell you a story. It was '96. I'd been up here 42 days. Every time I passed over Texas, I'd look down, knowing the second Mrs Kowalsky, was looking up, thinking of me. Six weeks I'm blowing kisses to that woman. Then we land at Edwards and I find out she'd run off with a lawyer before I was off the launch pad, so I packed my car and I headed to... \nMISSION CONTROL Tijuana. You've told this story, Kowalsky. As Houston recalls, she took off in your '74 GTO. Engineering requests fuel status on the jet pack prototype. \nMatt smiles, checks the monitors of the sleek device strapped to his back. \nMATT Five hours off the reservation and I show 30% drain. My compliments to Engineering. Except for a slight malfunction on the nulling of the roll axis, this jetpack is one prime piece of thrust. MISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO) Engineering says thank you. \nMATT Tell them I still prefer my '67 Corvette though. Speaking of which did I ever tell you the-- \nMISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO) We know the Corvette story, Matt. \nMATT Even Engineering? \nMISSION CONTROL Especially engineering. We're going to miss you, Matt. \nMatt grins, fiddles with a control and propels himself away from the Shuttle. \nStationed around the telescope are TWO ASTRONAUTS carrying out a repair mission. They are also wearing space suits but unlike Matt, they are not wearing Manned Maneuvering Units. SAFETY TETHERS are the only things stopping them from floating away into space. \nRYAN Comm card reboot in progress. \nMISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO) Thank you doctor. Shariff, what's your status? \nSHARIFF Nearly there. Replacing battery module A1 and C. \nSHARIFF DASARI is an Indian engineer in his mid-thirties. He is attached with tethers to a platform on one side of the Hubble. This is his second mission into outer space. \nMISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO) Could you be more specific? Indeterminate estimates make Houston anxious. SHARIFF No... no... no Houston, don't be anxious. Anxiety is not good for the heart... The system is ready to re- activate. \nMISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO) Hubble Telescope engaged. Upgrade fully functional. That applause you hear is for you, Shariff. Congratulations. Kick back, take the rest of the day off. \nShariff cheers and begins singing a pop tune in Hindi, bursting into a Zero-G Bollywood choreography that is repressed by the stiffness of his space suit. \nSHARIFF (SINGING) Woohoo... Jaise Baadal Paani Ka, Yaarana Hai Oh Jaise Paani Ka, Yaarana Hai. \nMISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO) Matt, please advise as to Mission Specialist Shariff's current activity. \nMATT He appears to be doing the Macarena of some sort. Though that would merely be a best guess scenario on my part. \nMatt is now approaching the Explorer, skillfully maneuvering his thrusters. \nThe other astronaut stands perched on a ROBOTIC ARM attached to the Shuttle. The arm is a crane-like moving platform remotely operated from inside the Shuttle. \nWe TRACK In on the astronaut as she works intently alone. \nMISSION CONTROL Dr. Stone. Houston. Medical now have you with a temperature drop to 35.9 and heart rate rise to 70. How are you doing? \nRYAN Houston, I'm fine, it's just... (SHE SWALLOWS) ...Keeping your lunch down in zero G is harder than it looks. MISSION CONTROL Doctor Stone? Medical is asking if you want to return to Explorer? \nRyan HUMS as she jiggles the CARD. \nRYAN No, we've been here for a week Houston, let's just finish this. \nRYAN STONE is a medical engineer, specialized in hospital scanning systems. She's focused on her work as though she's all alone in the world. This is her first mission. \nRyan eyes the Card, then... \nRYAN (CONT'D (CONT'D) Card is up. \nMISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO) That's a negative. I'm afraid we're getting nothing on this end, doctor. \nRyan eyes the Card, then... \nRYAN Try again. \nMISSION CONTROL (a beat, then...) Still nothing. \nRYAN Houston, could you please turn that music off? \n", "test1_id": 1323, "test2_input": "Matt laughs softly. \nWe arrive back on him as he turns back to look at Earth. Something flickers briefly in Matt's eyes-- something COMPLICATED-- \nMATT Hmmmm. Terrific. \nRyan inspects a panel inside the telescope, studying it with a small mirror. \nRYAN Houston, from first inspection comms panel appears to be dead. Am I a go to cut link to auxiliary? MISSION CONTROL You're the expert, doctor. It's your call. \nRyan takes out the small mirror and Matt stretches his arm, offering assistance, but- \nShe does not want any help and puts the mirror away in her toolbox, leaving Matt with his arm outstretched. \nRyan starts looking for another tool, but Matt is one move ahead of her, offering her a pair of tweezers. \nRyan hesitates and takes the tool. She starts working on the panel. \nMATT Houston, I have a bad feeling about this mission. \nMISSION CONTROL Please elaborate. \nMATT It's the same feeling I had at Mardi Gras in 1987...? \nHe waits, letting the moment hang knowingly. Then: \nMISSION CONTROL That is affirmative. Surprisingly, control hasn't heard the Mardi Gras story. Please proceed. \nMATT Well, it's day one and I'm bumping my way down Bourbon Street looking for the sister of a friend of mine. The streets are swimming with people, I'm thinking there's no way I'm finding this girl... \nRyan rolls her eyes and mumbles to herself- \nRYAN Proceeding to over ride. \nMatt continues his story without missing a beat- \nMATT Then all of a sudden I look up and -- there she is. (MORE) MATT (CONT'D) I am about to yell out when I notice she's holding hands with a short hairy guy in board shorts and a Margaritaville T-shirt. Then I realize, the guy's no guy. My sister's friend is holding hands with a-- \nMission Control interrupts on the radio. \nMISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO) ISS, this is Houston. \nSPACE STATION CAP (ON RADIO) Zlotze Houston. \nRyan inserts the plate into the Hubble. \nMISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO) Explorer, this is Houston. \nEXPLORER CAP (ON RADIO) Go ahead Houston. \nMISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO) Mission abort. Repeat: mission abort. Initiate emergency disconnect from Hubble. \nAll the astronauts stop what they're doing and anxiously await further instructions, except for Ryan who keeps working. \nMISSION CONTROL (CONT'D) (ON RADIO) Begin re-entry procedure. Start Deorbit Prep for PLS at Kennedy. ISS, initiate emergency evacuation. \nMatt is immediately flung into action and rapidly unharnesses himself from the Hubble. \nEXPLORER CAP (ON RADIO) Copy all Houston, and in work. Matt, immediate return to Explorer. Repeat, immediate return to Explorer. \nMATT Roger. Explorer, prep airlock! EXPLORER CAP (ON RADIO) Airlock engaged--ready to receive. \nRyan is working on the panel. \nMATT Houston. Elaborate. \nMISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO) Debris from the impact has caused a chain reaction, hitting other satellites in its path and creating new debris. Norad reports that orbital and ballistic effects are driving the cloud of debris up toward your altitude. How copy? \nMATT Copy all Houston. (TO RYAN) Put a bow on it Dr. Stone. \nRYAN I can't. If I turn it off now we'll lose the whole system. \nShe keeps on furiously tweaking. \nMATT I'm not going to ask you again. \nRYAN ONE SECOND-- \nMATT Not one second. Now! Shut it down! THAT'S AN ORDER!!! \nShe looks up, sees Matt glaring. Looks him in the eye. \nRYAN Sorry. I'm sorry. It's done. \n", "test2_true": "Matt watches her go, then: EXPLORER CAP (ON RADIO) Kowalsky, initiate emergency disconnect from the Hubble. \nMATT Alright Shariff, let's do this. \nSHARIFF Roger. \nShariff turns and heads toward the base of the telescope holding onto the hangar's handrails. \nMATT Houston. Update. \nMatt PROPELS himself to the base of the Hubble using the propelling unit on his back. \nMISSION CONTROL We have a full on chain reaction. It's been confirmed that it is the unintentional side effect of the Russians striking one of their own satellites. \nShariff arrives to the base of the telescope. \nSHARIFF They shot down their own satellite? \nMATT Right of disposal. Most likely a spy sat gone bad. Now it's space junk. \nMatt grabs onto the base of the telescope- \nMATT (CONT'D) Explorer, ready to disengage HST. \nEXPLORER CAP (ON RADIO) Locks releasing in three... two... one... \nThe locks attaching the Hubble to the Explorer release. Matt and Shariff give the Hubble a push away from the hangar. Pushing the huge telescope is not a difficult task in zero gravity. \nMISSION CONTROL Explorer, new data coming through. \nAs it floats away, Matt gives the telescope a small spin. MATT What's the blowback, Houston? \nMISSION CONTROL It's not good. Most of our systems are going down. Debris chain reaction is out of control and rapidly expanding. Multiple sats are now down and they keep on falling. \nMatt eyes the arm as it slowly retracts, carrying Ryan back. \nMATT Define \"multiple\" sats. \nMISSION CONTROL Most of them. Telecomunications systems are gone. Expect a communication blackout at any moment. \nRYAN Kowalsky, visual of debris at nine o'clock. \nMatt's eyes shift, watching a LARGE OBJECT, a piece of a BSE SATELLITE, spiral toward them. \nMATT Half of North America just lost their Facebook. \nThe sat glides by at tremendous speed. \nMISSION CONTROL You're a go for TH1138. Repeat You're a go for TH1138 procedure. \nEXPLORER CAP Copy that Houston. \nMATT Explorer, this is Kowalsky. Confirming visual contact with debris. Debris is from a BSE sat. To repeat-- \nSHARIFF Heads up! \nMATT To repeat I have- \nANOTHER OBJECT, part of a WEATHER SATELLITE, hurls by them, a little bit closer than the previous one. RYAN Dr. Stone requesting faster, faster transport. \nIt is followed by a SMALL PIECE OF DEBRIS. It zooms by faster than the previous ones and hits the BSE SATELLITE. \nThe satellite EXPLODES into hundreds of pieces and- \nA CHAIN REACTION takes place. \nMATT We have to go. Go, go! Go! \nThe DEBRIS from the BSE satellite hits the WEATHER SATELLITE, and it EXPLODES, sending debris in all directions. \nMISSION CONTROL Attention. New data suggests immediate evacuation absolu... \nA high frequency of interference and- \nTHE COMMUNICATION IS LOST. \nTHE ARM transporting Ryan is moving very slowly. \nRYAN Dr. Stone requesting faster transport to the bay area. Explorer get me down. \nMATT Explorer permission to retrieve Dr. Stone. \nEXPLORER CAP (ON RADIO) You are a go, Kowalsky. \n", "test2_id": 1324, "test3_input": "MATT (ON RADIO) So then you know. \nRYAN I crashed it. I-- \nMATT (ON RADIO) It's a Simulator. That's what it's designed for. \nRYAN Every time. I crashed the Simulator every time. \nMATT (ON RADIO) It's not rocket science. Just point the damn thing at earth and by this time tomorrow you'll be back in Lake Zurich with one hell of a story to tell. You copy? Ryan. You copy? \nRYAN I'm going to take the Soyuz and come get you. \nMATT No you're not. . I have too much of a head start. That ship already sailed. RYAN No. I'm coming to get you. \nMATT Ryan, you're going to have to learn to let go. \nRYAN But... I... \nMATT (ON RADIO) I want to hear you say you're going to make it. \nRyan is struggling for breath. \nMATT (CONT'D) (ON RADIO) Ryan! Say it! \nRYAN I'm... I'm going to make it. \nMATT Alright. Keep going \nRyan stares at Matt's tiny figure in the distance. \nMATT (CONT'D) What kind of name is Ryan for a girl? \nRYAN Dad wanted a boy. \nMATT Are you close to the airlock? \nRYAN Not yet. \nMATT Keep going. \nRyan continues to the Airlock. \nMATT (CONT'D) So, now that we have some distance between us- you're attracted to me, aren't you? \nRYAN What? MATT Well, people say I have beautiful blue eyes. \nRYAN You... you have beautiful... you have beautiful blue eyes. \nMATT I have brown eyes... that hurts. \nShe looks at Matt's figure receding. \nMATT (CONT'D) (ON RADIO) You wanna know the good news? \nRYAN What? \nMATT (ON RADIO) I'm going to break Anatoly's record, and I think mine's going to stand for a long, long time. \nRYAN No... I'm coming to get you. \nMATT You know, Ryan is a nice name for a girl. Wow, you should see the sun on the Ganges. It's amazing. \nRyan starts to respond, then falters, watching Matt's figure grow ever smaller. \nTHE SAD CROONING of HANK WILLIAMS crackles through the dying radio. \nRYAN (in a daze) Matt... \nOnly static hisses... \nRYAN (CONT'D) Matt! \nStatic again as Matt falls deeper into the distance, becoming lost in a sea of white specks and- The transmission ends. \nSILENCE \nINSIDE THE HELMET- \nRyan is dizzy, sweating, and having trouble focusing. She sees MATT- \nNothing more than a dot. \nShe stretches her hand toward him, as if trying to touch him with the tips of her fingers. But the dot has already vanished into never-ending darkness. \n", "test3_true": "Ryan is about to lose consciousness, when- \nA new ALARM GOES OFF. \nShe takes one deep breath as she opens her eyes widely. \nIf she doesn't move, she'll die. \nRyan pulls herself forward, reaching for a handle on the Soyuz. She grabs it and reaches for another, climbing her way toward the Station's airlock. \nBut she's losing focus. \nAs her right hand is reaching for a handle, everything becomes a blur, and she misses. \nINSIDE THE HELMET - \nHer brain is shutting down from lack of oxygen. She struggles to open her eyes and mumbles words that are unintelligible. \nShe reaches up again, almost blindly. Her hand grips the handle, and with one huge effort- \nShe sprints across the Docking Module, swinging from handle to handle, in one continual push, until she reaches the- \nAIRLOCK. \nShe stops, takes one deep breath and- \nShe turns the latch and OPENS the re-entry hatch. The hatch BLOWS OPEN as the air inside the cabin escapes into the vacuum, almost throwing Ryan back into space, but she holds tightly onto the latch. \nShe hangs outside, trying to gasp the last breath of oxygen inside her life system. She sees her feet dangling against the emptiness of space and- \nWith one last effort, she pulls herself into the airlock. \nAIRLOCK MODULE. INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. 500 KM ABOVE EARTH. \nAs she enters she does a 180-degree flip. As soon as her legs are in, she grabs onto the latch, and- \nCLOSES THE HATCH. \nShe turns the latch and- \nTHE CABIN IS SEALED OFF. \nINSIDE THE HELMET- \nRyan is suffocating. With very little oxygen and her body intoxicated by the nitrogen in her blood, her breathing is coarse and painful. \nShe can hardly keep her eyes open, and she pushes herself through the cabin, an empty cylinder lit by two circular mercury lights. She reaches the- \nCONTROL PANEL, a small computer with a screen that monitors the atmospheric and temperature levels inside the airlock. \nShe presses a button on the panel and- \nTHE CABIN BEGINS TO PRESSURIZE. \nA low hissing sound can be heard as the tanks in the Station begin pumping pure oxygen into the airlock. The control panel's monitor shows the atmospheric levels slowly rising. \nINSIDE THE HELMET- \nRyan gasps for air, but there is none. \nShe stares at the red-orange-green graph on the control panel showing the atmospheric levels. It reads red. Her pupils begin to dilate as- \nSOUND BEGINS TO SURFACE- In the vacuum of space there was nothing to carry sound waves, but now sound begins to travel through the oxygen that slowly fills the cabin. \nThe sounds are muffled, like the sounds of the outside world heard from within the womb. \nA beeping sound intermittently penetrates the airlock, anxious and halting. \nThe Control System's graph slowly moves from red to orange. The cabin is still not fully pressurized. \nBut that will have to do. \nWith one sharp motion- \nSHE TAKES OFF HER HELMET- \nAnd pushes it from her head. \nShe gasps for air and coughs. \nShe contorts and shakes, fighting to breath in the thin atmosphere of the airlock. Her helmet bounces around the walls of the cabin, floating. \nThe beeping sound has become clearer and recognizable - it is an alarm ringing out across the Station. \n", "test3_id": 1325}

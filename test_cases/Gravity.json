{"train": "GRAVITY \nWritten by \nMay 29, 2012 BLACK. \nSILENCE. \nCARD 1 AT 600 KM ABOVE PLANET EARTH THE TEMPERATURE FLUCTUATES BETWEEN 120 AND -100 DEGREES CELSIUS. \nSILENCE. \nCARD 2 THERE IS NOTHING TO CARRY SOUND, NO OXYGEN, AND NO AIR PRESSURE. \nSILENCE. \nCARD 3 LIFE HERE IS IMPOSSIBLE. \nSILENCE. \nTITLE- \nGRAVITY \nBLACK- \nOUTER SPACE, 600 KILOMETERS ABOVE- \nPLANET EARTH. \nLike all images of Earth seen from space, this image of our planet is mythical and majestic. \nThe globe seems almost tangible, slowly spinning, floating in the endless void of space. It is a blue planet, and bright white clouds twirl and stretch in capricious patterns across the deep blue of the oceans and the jigsaw of continents: green, yellow and brown. \nIt is noon in Cape Town and early night in India. \nThe sphere is almost a perfect orb except for the darkened sliver on its Eastern edge. It is beautiful! And so full of life. \nBut not here. \nHere it is completely silent. \nSILENCE- \nIN THE DISTANCE- \nA small metal object crosses the empty space surrounding Earth. If it appears to be a small satellite that is only because it is far away from us. It is the size of one football field. It is- \nThe INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISS). \nIt resembles a dragonfly. Its solar panels stretch out, like wings, from the long body made of connected pressurized modules. \nIt floats with a sense of proud achievement. \nIt orbits at an altitude of 500 km above sea level. It moves at an average of 27,700 kilometers per hour, completing 15.7 laps around the Earth per day. \nIt is cruising over Zimbabwe. To the East, the island of Madagascar. Up to the North, the expansive dry lands of Somalia and Ethiopia. \nSoon, the ISS curves around the spherical planet, and it becomes smaller, almost indistinguishable, no more than a small bright spec grazing over the blue atmosphere. \nCLOSER TO US- \nOrbiting at an altitude of 600 km- \nThe EXPLORER SPACE SHUTTLE becomes visible. \nThis icon of space exploration has played a key role in all of NASA's missions since the late 90's. \nFaintly we hear static, voices murmuring over radio frequences. As the babble bulds we might hear one conversation amongst the REST: \nMISSION CONTROL (On radio, faint) Explorer, please verify that the P1 ATA removal on replacement cap part 1 and 2 are complete. EXPLORER CAP (On radio, faint) DMA M1, M2, M3 and M4 are complete. \nMISSION CONTROL (On radio, faint) Copy that Explorer. Dr Stone-Houston, requesting status update... \nA fizz of static and then the voice continues with sudden, starling clarity. \nRYAN Installation ninety-five percent complete. Running level one diagnostics on circuits, sensors, and power. Standby. \nMISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO) Standing by. Looks like we're on schedule. Dr. Stone, Medical is concerned about your ECG readings. \nRYAN I'm fine Houston. \nMISSION CONTROL (RADIO) Well, medical doesn't agree doctor. Are you feeling nauseous? \nMISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO) Kowalsky? \nMATT Not a problem. \nMatt toggles a switch and the music stops. \nRYAN Thank you, Kowalsky. \nRyan moves the Card around. \nRYAN (CONT'D) Now, Houston? MISSION CONTROL Negative. \nRYAN Could Houston be misinterpreting the data--? \nMISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO) We're not receiving any data. Engineering is recommending a vis- check for component damage. \nAgain, as if to herself- \nRYAN Mmmm. Let me see what's going on. \nShe starts to disengage one of the panels. \nRYAN (CONT'D) (MUMBLES) What have you got here? \nRyan takes out a card from under the plate and begins to examine it. Matt begins to approach her. \nRYAN (CONT'D) Visual examination doesn't reveal any damaged components. The problem must be originating in the comms panel. \nMISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO) That seems to be the case. Engineering admits that you warned us that this could happen. That's as close to an apology as you're going to get from them. We should've listened to you doc. \nWithout losing any time, Ryan puts the card back into the TELESCOPE- \nRYAN I'm on it. \nMISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO) Copy that. How long do you think it'll take you? \nMatt begins a wide loop around the telescope. RYAN An hour. \nMISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO) Outstanding. We appreciate your patience, Doctor. Installing your system in the Hubble is the main purpose of this mission. \nRyan doesn't respond, continuing to work. Matt closes in as he circles the telescope. \nMISSION CONTROL (CONT'D) Houston trusts Mission Commander Kowalsky realizes that this delay is not of sufficient duration to enable him to surpass Anatoly's Solovyev's spacewalking record, as most recent calculations indicate that he will be left... \nMATT Seventy-five minutes shy. Never crossed my mind. \nMISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO) Matt, It's been a privilege. \nMatt hesitates ever-so-briefly, then... \nMATT Right back atcha, Houston. \nMISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO) Enjoy your last walk... \nMATT Am I a go to assist Dr. Stone in removing the panel? \nRYAN Assistance appreciated. \nMISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO) Permission granted. MATT Thank you, Houston. (TO RYAN) Mind if I join the fun? \nRYAN Certainly. \nRyan begins unbolting. Matt lands right next to Ryan and grabs onto the telescope. She is frustrated, determined. \nMATT How are you feeling? \nRYAN Like a Chihuahua that's being tumble dried. \nMatt takes out his pistol grip, and with fast precision puts its head to a bolt and begins unscrewing. Matt removes the bolt with confidence. \nMATT It's been a rough week. If it makes you feel any better, I puked up everything but my kidneys on my first ride. \nRyan is not as precise with her pistol grip, and when a bolt COMES OFF- \nShe DROPS IT. \nRYAN Whoa...! AWOL! \nThe bolt spins floating away. She tries to grab it but MISSES, barely touching it but brushing it just enough to give it a push that makes it change direction.... \nShe turns and reaches out to grab it, but she is strapped to the Robotic Arm. \nThe bolt spins out into the emptiness of space when- \nRyan's choking. The lack of oxygen is making her veins pop out and her lips turn blue. \nHer eyes open wide, and- \nShe exhales. \nOHH... \nAnd begins breathing deeply. \nAHHHHHH... OHHHHHH.... \nAs her breathing steadies, she begins to focus, her eyes searching the distance. THROUGH THE HELMET- \nRyan can see her face reflected against the visor, lit by the control panels. \nShe dims the light and she can see- \nHer legs and arms floating against endless space as she drifts towards the empty void, broken only by lonesome stars whose position change as she rotates, giving way to- \nTHE EARTH, \nVery still and very distant. Night is creeping across the sphere as the sun sets, a sliver of light on the Western Hemisphere. \nA metallic object floating over the Earth is hit by a RAY of the sinking sun, and it gleams like a tiny star. Her eyes blink in recognition, gleaming with alertness. \nHer intellect engages and she gains a new sense of calm. \nRYAN (CONT'D) Houston, this is Dr. Ryan Stone.. I'm drifting but I have a visual of Explorer. \nHer eyes scan the enveloping darkness, trying to get a fix on the gleaming orb that is earth, her face alive with concentration as she makes calculations. \nRYAN (CONT'D) With North at 12 o'clock, the Shuttle is at the center of the dial. \nShe frowns as she tumbles backward again, recalculating. \nThe sun is slipping behind the Earth. She studies the rim of fire until it too slides from view. \nRYAN (CONT'D) I can see the Chinese station. No, no, no, it's the International Space Station. \nThe sun's glow illuminates another object in the distance, a bright spec hovering over the horizon- the INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. \nRYAN (CONT'D) ISS is at 6, no, 7 o'clock. \nJust then, the sun's rays recede and the Station DIMS, becoming one with the darkness. Ryan blinks, mildly alarmed. INSIDE THE HELMET- \nRYAN (CONT'D) Lieutenant Kowalsky, do you copy? \nSilence. \nRYAN (CONT'D) Explorer, do you copy? \nSilence. \nSlowly, the sun recedes further behind the earth and the light bathing Ryan's face evaporates. As she is swallowed by the darkness, she speaks once again: \nRYAN (CONT'D) Houston, do you copy? \nTHE WHOLE FACE OF THE EARTH IS IN SHADOW. \nAnd so is Ryan. Her eyes dart. It is utterly silent. She spins in the darkness, waiting. \nRYAN (CONT'D) Houston, this is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone. I'm off structure and I'm drifting. \nThere is only the silence, complete and absolute. \nRYAN (CONT'D) Do you copy? \nNothing. She watches the earth slip from view yet again. \nWhen next she speaks, the words are as delicate as snowflakes, tripping off her tongue like a prayer... \nRYAN (CONT'D) Anybody...? Anyone...? Please copy. \nA soothing light hits Ryan's face. \nTHE MOON is rising over the Pacific Ocean. \nIt's almost full and its soft cool light pours over the globe, brightening the deep blue waters and- \nIN THE DISTANCE - \nA LIGHT, not bigger than a star, is FLICKERING. Ryan's eyes focus on the light. Her PUPILS DILATE. Something like tears glistens as she stares at the flickering light, afraid to blink as she watches the... \nMATT See? Where you go, I go. \nMatt ignites a new thrust to re-direct his position. As he does so Ryan's change of momentum makes him swing again. \nMATT (CONT'D) Better. Let's get out of here. Using his thrusters, Matt negotiates a new position and, igniting a long thrust, he jets away. \nRyan cannot repress the anger boiling up, and SHE SCREAMS- \nRYAN Ahh Dammit! \nMATT I know what you mean. \nRYAN Ahhh Dammit. \nMATT You're burning oxygen, we're going to go back to the shuttle. How's that for a plan. Copy? \nRYAN FUCK \nMATT Right copy that. \nAs Matt accelerates toward a lower orbit, his momentum takes over, steadying Ryan's swing. \nMATT (CONT\"D) (CONT'D) Houston in the blind, this is Kowalsky. Dr Stone and I are making our way to base, please prepare Airlock for arrival. Copy? \nThey descend, gliding through pieces of debris. Among the space junk, a Solar Panel from the Hubble is distinguished. \nMatt eyes a small dot in the distance: the Shuttle. \nMATT (CONT'D) Houston this is Kowalsky. How do you copy? \nRYAN Why aren't they answering? \nMATT It seems like communications are lost. \nRYAN Can they hear us on an alternate frequency? MATT We don't know. That's why we keep talking. If someone is listening they might just save your life. Set your watch for ninety minutes. \nMatt reaches for a digital watch strapped to his wrist and sets up the timer for- 90 MINUTES. \nRYAN Why ninety? \nMATT Houston clocked that debris at fifty thousand miles per hour. Factoring in our current orbit, I reckon we've got 90 minutes before we play duck and cover again. \nRyan sets her watch, studies the counter as it begins to count down. \nRYAN 02 down to six percent. \nAs they travel, the Shuttle begins to take form. \nMATT Okay. Pretty scary shit being untethered up here, isn't it? \nRYAN Yeah. Pretty scary shit. \nMATT (after a beat) You did all right. \nSilence. \nMATT (CONT'D) (to the Shuttle) Houston, in the blind. This is Kowalsky. Our current location is approximately 900 meters out from the Explorer. Dr. Stone and I would like to retrieve the body of Mission Specialist Shariff and return it to Shuttle. Am I a go to retrieve? \nSilence. MATT (CONT'D) Roger that. \nMatt changes direction and approaches Shariff. He has to ignite several small thrusts to try and steady his direction, fighting against Ryan's momentum. \nRYAN Where is he? Where is he? \nShariff's body is tethered to a PANEL that was ripped away from the Explorer. Matt approaches the panel and ignites the thrusters to slow down his course, and- \nHe grabs onto it. Ryan, continuing her momentum, crashes against Shariff's body. The contact slows her trajectory, but it throws Shariff away, his tether tensing, pulling the panel with him. \nRYAN (CONT'D) Oh, my God. Oh, my God. \nMatt, holding on to the metal, spins with it. He detaches Shariff's tether from the panel and attaches it to himself. \nHe lets the panel go and immediately ignites his thruster, pulling the two tethers behind him which, as they tense, bring Ryan and Shariff closer together. \nMATT Grab him! \nRYAN I'm trying. I'm trying. \nMATT Quick. You're pulling me away. \nRYAN I got him. I got him. \nMatt tries to ignite a very long thrust in the direction of the Shuttle, but this is difficult as the momentum of the other two bodies pulls him in all directions. \nThey are heading toward a small point in the distance, the Space Station, which is in a lower orbit. \nOUTER SPACE. 550 KM ABOVE EARTH. \nWe see the two astronauts crossing the distance - a thrust, and they coast ahead, and then another thrust. Matt pulls Ryan behind him. \nTwo specks glide across the dark sky as a sliver of light grows on the darkened hemisphere. \nTHE SUN IS RISING. WATCHING THE SUNRISE \nTHE SUN looks brighter and clearer than ever outside of Earth's atmosphere. The oceans and the continents brighten as its light spills over the Earth beneath them. \nWarm rays of sun caress the two astronauts as they propel themselves across the empty expanse. \nRYAN 02 down to two percent. \nMATT We're getting there. \nMATT (CONT'D) Beautiful, don't you think? \nRYAN What? \nMATT The sunrise. That's what I'm going to miss the most. \nBut Ryan is not into the view right now. She's stricken with fear. Her jaw is clenched and her eyes are almost closed. \nMatt looks at the dark emptiness that engulfs him and smiles. \nMATT (CONT'D) So, where's home, Dr. Stone? \nRyan keeps her eyes closed, doesn't answer. Matt, trying to DISTRACT HER- \nMATT (CONT'D) Ryan. Where's home? \nRyan opens her eyes, but still she doesn't dare to look out of the helmet. \nRYAN Home? \nMATT Ah ha. Down there. Mother Earth. Where do you pitch your tent? \nRYAN Lake Zurich. \nMATT Where the hell is that? RYAN Illinois. \nMATT Illinois. Central time zone. That makes it roughly... 8pm right now. What are the good people of Lake Zurich doing at 8 o'clock in the evening? \nRyan tries to overcome her fear and looks out. She frowns, terrified by the sight, and hides her face once more inside the helmet. \nRYAN I don't know... \nMATT What would you be doing? \nShe tries again. This time she forces herself and stares out at the Earth, which is over 500 kilometers below her. \nMATT (CONT'D) Come on. It's 8 o'clock. You've just clocked out of the hospital after putting in your customary 18-hour shift. You're driving home... \nRyan's wide open eyes are transfixed on Earth, like a deer in headlights. \nRYAN The radio. I listen to the radio... \nMATT There we go. Let me guess. NPR? Classical. Top for-- \nRYAN Anything. Doesn't matter. As long as they don't talk. I just drive... \nHer glassy eyes reveal a strong emotion growing inside of her, taking over her body. It is not fear, it is something deeper and more painful. \nMatt studies her curiously. \nMATT What do you miss down there? \nRyan looks at the Earth. It never felt so far away. A long silence without an answer. \nMATT (CONT'D) Is there a Mr. Stone? \nShe frowns, unable to comprehend this initially, as if it were a particularly complicated bit of math, then shakes her head. \nRYAN No... \nMATT Nobody special? Someone down there, looking up, thinking of you? \nRyan closes her eyes. She remains silent. A silence that can't hide an unspeakable pain. \nRYAN I had a daughter. \nMATT (ON RADIO) So then you know. \nRYAN I crashed it. I-- \nMATT (ON RADIO) It's a Simulator. That's what it's designed for. \nRYAN Every time. I crashed the Simulator every time. \nMATT (ON RADIO) It's not rocket science. Just point the damn thing at earth and by this time tomorrow you'll be back in Lake Zurich with one hell of a story to tell. You copy? Ryan. You copy? \nRYAN I'm going to take the Soyuz and come get you. \nMATT No you're not. . I have too much of a head start. That ship already sailed. RYAN No. I'm coming to get you. \nMATT Ryan, you're going to have to learn to let go. \nRYAN But... I... \nMATT (ON RADIO) I want to hear you say you're going to make it. \nRyan is struggling for breath. \nMATT (CONT'D) (ON RADIO) Ryan! Say it! \nRYAN I'm... I'm going to make it. \nMATT Alright. Keep going \nRyan stares at Matt's tiny figure in the distance. \nMATT (CONT'D) What kind of name is Ryan for a girl? \nRYAN Dad wanted a boy. \nMATT Are you close to the airlock? \nRYAN Not yet. \nMATT Keep going. \nRyan continues to the Airlock. \nMATT (CONT'D) So, now that we have some distance between us- you're attracted to me, aren't you? \nRYAN What? MATT Well, people say I have beautiful blue eyes. \nRYAN You... you have beautiful... you have beautiful blue eyes. \nMATT I have brown eyes... that hurts. \nShe looks at Matt's figure receding. \nMATT (CONT'D) (ON RADIO) You wanna know the good news? \nRYAN What? \nMATT (ON RADIO) I'm going to break Anatoly's record, and I think mine's going to stand for a long, long time. \nRYAN No... I'm coming to get you. \nMATT You know, Ryan is a nice name for a girl. Wow, you should see the sun on the Ganges. It's amazing. \nRyan starts to respond, then falters, watching Matt's figure grow ever smaller. \nTHE SAD CROONING of HANK WILLIAMS crackles through the dying radio. \nRYAN (in a daze) Matt... \nOnly static hisses... \nRYAN (CONT'D) Matt! \nStatic again as Matt falls deeper into the distance, becoming lost in a sea of white specks and- The transmission ends. \nSILENCE \nINSIDE THE HELMET- \nRyan is dizzy, sweating, and having trouble focusing. She sees MATT- \nNothing more than a dot. \nShe stretches her hand toward him, as if trying to touch him with the tips of her fingers. But the dot has already vanished into never-ending darkness. \nOrange is turning to green. Her lungs begin to absorb the oxygen and her breath becomes more even. Her body floats, relaxed in the confined space of the airlock. \nSHE FLOATS. \nRyan brings her hands together and removes one glove. \nAnd then the other. \nDesperately, she begins to unscrew the lock near her waist. She squirms under the suit and pushes off the upper half. \nThen she throws off the lower half, squirming out of it as if shedding her old skin, desperate to free herself from the claustrophobia of the suit. \nWearing only underwear and a t-shirt, she floats in mid-air, relieved and exhausted. The hum of the Space Station surrounds her. \nThen, slowly, she pulls her knees to her chest and enfolds them in her arms, floating in a fetal position. For a moment, Ryan simply hangs in suspension, a fly in amber, surrendering to the poetry of the planets, rotating slowly in the cabin's womb. \nOUTER SPACE. 500 KM ABOVE THE EARTH. \nSILENCE. \nThe International Space Station, with its modules, its torn solar panels, and the Soyuz with its parachute billowing out from its center, is dwarfed against Earth's orb and the infinite universe stretching out beyond. \nThe Station looks frail and secluded, lost somewhere between the grandness of the Heavens and the Earth below. \nEverything is still. \nINTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. ZVEZDA MODULE. \nThe module is like a wide corridor filled with cabinets, a small eating area and a small gym. A HUM reverberates across the station. \nAt the end of the module there is an open circular hatch leading INTO THE- \nUNITY NODE 1. \nA spherical space with three hatches, each leading into different modules. \nA HATCH OPENS and- \nRyan floats in. She stops at the center and holds onto a handle. \nShe looks in all directions and launches to her right, towards THE- \nZARYA MODULE. \nThere are sleeping bags fastened to the walls. Clothes, shoes, a strip of three condoms -- all kinds of personal objects float in chaos around the module. \nIt's clear that someone left in a hurry. \nRyan passes a stationary bicycle and reaches for a metal cabinet on the wall. She OPENS drawers, looking for something. \nRYAN Come on, come on. \nShe finds what she's looking for: a BAG OF WATER with a straw at one end. She unscrews the top and begins to drink from it. \nShe DRINKS in long gulps, squeezing the bottle, trying to quench her thirst. DROPS FLOAT out of her mouth as the water overflows. They float around her face like perfect pearls of different sizes. \nShe takes a pause from drinking to catch her breath. The water is cooling her down, but she still takes another long, thirsty gulp and empties the bag. \nShe checks the count on the STOPWATCH- 14 minutes and counting down. \nShe takes a new bag of water from the drawer, and pushing herself off of a wall, she dives into the- \nUNITY NODE 2- \nRYAN (CONT'D) OK. Where are you? Where are you? Comms. Comms... There you are! \nWithout stopping, she goes through one of the open hatches into THE- \nZVEZDA MODULE. \nThe walls are filled with electrical equipment and wires. Without slowing down her momentum, she floats to the- \nMAIN CONSOLE- A large deck which houses all of the communication and navigational systems. \nOn the opposite wall there is a LARGE PORTHOLE through which Earth is clearly seen. \nShe begins to PUSH BUTTONS. \nCOMPUTERS COME TO LIFE and Ryan puts on a communications headset. \nSTATIC CRACKLES. \nRYAN Matt. This is Ryan. Copy? She waits. \nSPRAYS the extinguisher at the fire. But the extinguisher is no match for the fire, which has gathered in a gigantic smooth blue ball and is expanding, coming at her. \nRyan makes a fast turn and launches herself in the opposite direction into the- \nUNITY NODE- \nDashing straight into the- \nZARYA MODULE- \nShe darts across the module, behind her- \nThe expanding fire ball has swallowed the Unity Node and is making its way towards her, chasing her into the- \nUNITY NODE 2- Where she makes a quick turn and darts down into the- \nDOCKING MODULE- \nJust in time. Above her, the flames cross the Node as they spread into the rest of the Station. \nThey quickly spread downward, into the Docking Module. \nRyan, the flames caressing her feet, dives through a hatch into THE- \nSOYUZ. AIRLOCK. \nRyan crashes against a Space Suit floating inside and turns to close the hatch. \nTHE FIRE is spreading outside in the module, sucking the oxygen out of the Soyuz. An incandescent blue bubble that charges at her. \nRyan, faster than fire, CLOSES THE HATCH. \nTHE SOYUZ IS SEALED OFF. \nShe closes a second hatch, and the Soyuz is safe. \nShe exhales in RELIEF. \nA RUMBLE in the Station makes the Soyuz quake. \nThe extinguisher is blocking her path to the hatch and Ryan has to push it into the cabin as she darts toward the- \nSOYUZ. CONTROL CABIN. \nAs soon as she makes it through the hatch, she TURNS the CABIN LIGHTS ON. \nThere is just enough space for three astronauts to sit surrounded by the CONTROL PANEL that navigates the vessel. \nShe sits down in the command chair. \nShe fastens the safety belt, and looks around, trying to recognize the different buttons on the panel, which are all labeled in Russian. \nRYAN OK... where was it?... where was it? She moves her finger across the different buttons, searching. \nRYAN (CONT'D) Where is the power?... Here you are. \nHer finger stops on a button, which is labeled- BKN \nShe presses on it and the CONTROL PANEL turns ON. All the buttons light up and with a hum, the Soyuz's systems start to run. \nRYAN (CONT'D) Good... good... just like training... \nRyan reaches to the right, where next to the panel, there are several binders, each a different color. \nRYAN (CONT'D) Undocking... undocking... Yes... red... \nAnd she takes out a RED BINDER. \nIt's all written in Cyrillic. She turns the pages until she sees a GRAPHIC representing the UNDOCKING PROCEDURE. \nRYAN (CONT'D) Ok... Ok... I remember this... undocking... \nShe uses the CURSORS on the panel and selects a function on the COMPUTER SCREEN. \nShe presses another button and- \nOn the SCREEN, a COUNTDOWN- 4:30... 4:29... 4:28... \nAnother RUMBLE in the Station. \nRYAN (CONT'D) We don't have four minutes to spare. We're going manual... \nShe flips through the binder to another page. She looks at a diagram and uses the cursors on the panel to change the function on the screen- \nSHE'S SHAKEN BY A NEW PULL. \nOUTER SPACE. 500 KM ABOVE THE EARTH. \nThe Soyuz stabilizes over the Station, the parachute entwined with the solar panel. \nSOYUZ. CONTROL CABIN. \nShe looks out at- \nTHE PORTHOLE- \nThe rope extends from the cabin to the parachute tangled with the Station. \nRYAN Great. Fantastic. Perfect. \nOUTER SPACE. 500 KM ABOVE THE EARTH. \nSILENCE \nThe Station hovers below the Soyuz like a large whale swimming beneath a tiny lifeboat. \nThe HATCH of the Soyuz OPENS. \nRyan comes out of the craft into space. She's wearing the space suit she packed and she carries a large bag. \nShe holds onto handles as she floats, SAFELY TETHERED to the inside of the cabin. \nShe LOOKS around- \nThe International Space Station is a looming presence floating ten meters below. It is pulling the Soyuz by its parachute. \nAn ALARM on her STOPWATCH RINGS. It's been 85 MINUTES. \nShe turns the alarm off and looks around. \nRYAN Clear skies but with a chance of satellite debris. SHE HUMS A SONG, the tune is reminiscent of the Hank Williams Melody that Matt had played earlier. \nShe begins to climb around the vessel. With plenty of oxygen in her pressurized suit, this is not a difficult task. \nShe pulls herself from handle to handle, making her way around the Soyuz and reaching- \nTHE PARACHUTE CONTAINER- \nAn impact has blown open the cover. Three ropes float out of the container into space. Three meters away from the vessel each rope branches into dozens of parachute strings. Next to it- \nA second cover is also badly damaged. \nHarnessing herself to a handle, she inspects the ropes. The three ropes are bolted to the container's frame. \nRYAN (CONT'D) Okay. We detach this and we go home. Piece of cake. \nShe harnesses the bag and RESUMES her HUMMING, louder this time. \nShe unzips the bag and takes out the PISTOL GRIP tool, without noticing that behind her- \nDOZENS OF PIECES OF DEBRIS pass, zooming less than thirty meters away from the Station. \nA tiny piece of high-speed debris crashes against one of the Station's Solar panels, shattering it and causing the Station to tremble. \nShe places the tool against the FIRST BOLT, stretching her arm into the parachute container. It is an awkward position. \nShe pulls the trigger and the drill rotates, turning the bolt, but it slides out of the notch. \nShe places the tool once more against the bolt and pulls the trigger. The drill rotates, SLOWER this time. \nShe HUMS under her breath and SWEAT begins to drop down her forehead. \nShe is very focused, unaware that behind her- \nDEBRIS HITS THE STATION'S SOLAR PANEL, piercing holes through it. \nTHE BOLT COMES OFF. As it FLOATS OFF into space, Ryan drops the PISTOL GRIP and uses both hands to detach the rope from the frame. \nThe ROPE FLOATS away from the Soyuz, undulating like a long snake, but- \nRyan notices that the Pistol Grip is also floating away. \nShe stretches her arm trying to catch it, but it is out of her reach. \nShe pushes herself towards the pistol grip, and barely manages to grab onto it when she sees- \nRYAN (CONT'D) Oh shit. \nShe takes the JOYSTICK. \nRyan looks focused at- \nTHE PERISCOPE- \nWhere the western horizon comes into frame and nears the center crosshair. \nA small dot GLIMMERS in the distance- THE CHINESE STATION. \nRYAN (CONT'D) Ok. Let's visit the Chinese station. Houston in the blind, Tiangong is approximately 100km... to the west and I am off it's course by about 3 degrees. I will correct trajectory. \nShe moves the Joystick, and the crosshair readjusts. \nRYAN (CONT'D) Ok. She releases the safety lock and places her finger on the button. \nRYAN (CONT'D) Ok. I'll engage main thrust in five... four... three \nShe releases the safety lock. \nRYAN (CONT'D) two... one... \nShe pushes on the button. \nOUTER SPACE. 300 KM ABOVE EARTH. \nThe Soyuz floats with its nose directed towards a bright star on the horizon, the Chinese Station, but- \nNothing, not even a small flame, comes out of its back thrusters. \nCONTROL CABIN. \nRyan waits, expectantly, and gives the button a NEW PUSH, but- \nRYAN One... \nNothing. The thruster won't ignite. \nRYAN (CONT'D) One... one... \nOUTER SPACE. 300 KM ABOVE EARTH. \nThe vessel remains motionless, orbiting over the Pacific which is already under night's dark veil. \nCONTROL CABIN. \nShe pushes again, and again, and again- \nRYAN Come on. Come on! \nOUTER SPACE. 300 KM ABOVE EARTH. \nBut NOTHING. The Soyuz stays in place. \nCONTROL CABIN. \nRyan looks at the FUEL GAUGE- 30 percent. \nShe taps on it and the frozen needle drops to EMPTY. \nRYAN You gotta be kidding me. \nShe taps on the frozen dial once more, as if trying to get the needle to go back up, and once again- \nRYAN (CONT'D) Where's your backup? \nShe taps even harder this time. \nRYAN (CONT'D) Where's your goddamn backup?! \nShe bangs down on the control panel in frustration-- \nRYAN (CONT'D) FU-- \nOUTER SPACE. 300 KM ABOVE EARTH. \nInside the capsule, through the portal, Ryan hits and hits, bouncing around the confined space of the cabin and venting all her anger, until she herself is out of fuel. \nShe grabs the radio and- \nRYAN This is Dr Ryan Stone, can you hear me? Houston, this is Ryan Stone, can you hear me? Copy? Houston, this is Ryan Stone, can you hear me? Copy? \nTHE SUN SETS. \nRYAN (CONT'D) Where are you, Aningang? Is the sun out? Are there birds? Are there trees? Can you smell the ocean? \nTRANSMISSION Ieukpalliktuq naabuqtuq. \nRYAN Is it beautiful where you are? Here it's colder than hell and lonelier than shit, but it's beautiful Aningang. Utterly, terrifyingly beautiful. \nThrough THE PORTHOLE- Even under the darkness of night, it is possible to see the glaciers spreading over the green forests. It all looks so fresh and full of life. \nRYAN (CONT'D) Make your dogs bark again, Aningang. Will you? Please... \nTRANSMISSION Suli aasrivak aatqatik niuruq...? \nRYAN Dogs! Woof. Woof. Woof. \nShe makes barking noises. The man begins to laugh and barks back at her. \nTRANSMISSION Auuu. Auuu. Oipmiq. Oipmiq! Auuu. Auuu. \nRyan and Aningang bark in unison. \nRYAN Woof. Woof. \nTRANSMISSION Auuu... Auuu... \nRYAN AND TRANSMISSION Auuu. Auuu. Woof. Woof. \nRyan begins to HOWL, giving in to the mad joy of it all. Moments later, through the RADIO, she is joined by a CHORUS of CANINES--Aningang's DOGS--TUNING INTO HER VOICE in a mad, crazy harmonic cacophony. Ryan smiles, blissfully happy, howling with abandon. \nEach howling reaches deeper and is more cathartic, unlocking emotions that have been festering over time, and- \nTEARS ROLL FROM HER EYES, clear as crystals, spilling from her lashes and floating INTO THE AIR, glimmering LIKE SAPPHIRES in the cool moonlight. \nThey float away, like tiny satellites orbiting her face. \nAningang can be heard intermittently, YELLING, as if trying to silence the dogs. Then the dogs, one by one, cease their wailing and Ryan is left with nothing but her own voice. \nShe stops, gazing at her tears suspended in the gloomy blue light. RYAN I'm going to die, Aningang. \nThe SIGNAL ebbs, losing its battle with the STATIC. \nRYAN (CONT'D) I mean, we're all going to die. Everyone knows that. But I'm going to die today... \nThe STATIC waffles in and out. \nRYAN (CONT'D) Funny that. To know. \nThe STATIC breaks and Aningang's HUSKY VOICE begins SINGING. \nRYAN (CONT'D) And you know what Aningang... I don't care. I don't care if I die. I don't have anything... not anymore. \nRyan is floating now over her seat. \nRYAN (CONT'D) But the thing is... I'm still scared. I'm really scared... \nShe rolls in space and stares upwards... \nRYAN (CONT'D) No one will mourn me. No one will pray for my soul. Will you mourn me, Aningang? Is it too late to say a prayer? I'd say one for myself, but I have never prayed in my life... no one ever taught me how... \nThe tune is lyrical and soothing, tinged with a touch of melancholy. \nRYAN (CONT'D) No one ever taught me how... \nRyan listens to Aningang's melody and smiles softly, closing her eyes. \nRyan's face grows slack as she drifts toward unconsciousness, buoyed along on Aningang's sad soulful song. Then... \n...a SPUTTERING CRY cuts through the static. \nA BABY. Ryan's eyes pop open. \nRYAN (CONT'D) A baby. There's a baby with you. \nA beat. Aningang stops singing, speaking in a soft voice: \nTRANSMISSION Ieukpalliktuq upatimi... \nRYAN You are singing to your baby? Is that a lullaby? That's so sweet! \nRyan is transfixed, listening to the gentle gurgle of the baby as Aningang coos to it, then begins to SING again. \nRYAN (CONT'D) I used to sing to my baby too. \nPainful memories flash before her, haunting her. Ryan's lump in her throat is washed away by a gentle sob. \nAnd sound re-emerges with the beeping of the alarms as- \nThe red-orange-green graph on the control panel show the atmospheric levels reaching green. \nRyan uncovers her face and stares from the shadows at the figure, who straps into the seat next to her. He unlocks the ring around his collar and- \nTAKES OFF HIS HELMET. \nCOUNTRY WESTERN MUSIC escapes into the cabin. \nMATT Ahhhh! Alright, check your watch. 13 hours, 11 minutes. Call Anatoly, tell him he's been bumped. \nThe figure glances around. \nMATT (CONT'D) Bit gloomy in here. How `bout a little light? \nHe taps a few buttons on the console and a face blooms: \nMatt. \nRyan stares, mouth agape. \nRYAN How did you? \nMATT Trust me, it's a hell of a story. RYAN But how did you? \nHe reaches out and effortlessly flicks a myriad array of switches. Instantly, the alarms go silent. \nMATT That's better. \nRYAN How? \nRyan looks at him wide eyed, wanting to know how- \nMATT I found a little extra battery power. I'm just happy you're still alive. To be honest, I thought your chances were slim to none. By the way, did you find the vodka? \nRYAN You never told me where. \nMatt fishes a SMALL FLASK from under his seat, spins off the cap... \nMATT Oh well... To Anatoly! Na zdorovje. \n...and takes a big gulp. He offers the flask to Ryan, who appears to be dozing off. She blinks, shakes her head. \nRYAN No. \nHe studies her. \nMATT No? Right, let's get out of here. \nHe looks at the monitors, where the Chinese Station is seen. \nMATT (CONT'D) We're `bout a hundred miles to the Chinese Station. A little Sunday drive. \nRYAN We can't. \nMATT Course we can. RYAN There's no fuel. I tried everything. \nMATT Well, there's always something we can do. \nRYAN I tried everything. \nMATT Did you try the soft landing jets? \nRYAN They're for landing so. \nMATT Well landing is launching it's the same thing, didn't you learn about that in training? \nRYAN I never got to land the simulator, I told you. \nMATT But you know about it. \nRYAN And I crashed it every time. \nRyan is falling asleep. Matt studies her as she dozes off. \nMATT Listen you want to go back or do you want to stay here? I get it, it's nice up here, you can just shut down all the systems turn out all the lights, and just close your eyes and tune out everybody. \nMatt starts flipping through buttons on the console, turning the cabin lights off. \nMATT (CONT'D) There's nobody up here who can hurt you, it's safe. Then what's the point in going on, what's the point of living? \nWhen the cabin is in darkness, he turns and looks at Ryan. MATT (CONT'D) Your kid died, doesn't get any rougher than that, but still it's a matter of what you do now. If you decide to go that you've gotta just get on with it, sit back enjoy the ride. You have to start living life, Ryan. \nRYAN (CONT'D) Let's reset you then. \nUsing the manual as a reference, Ryan uses the cursors to select the ALTITUDE DISPLAY on the computer screen. \nThe current ALTITUDE is- 2600 M. \nShe uses the cursors and presses a button. A WARNING on the computer screen comes on. She presses another button, and- \nON THE SCREEN, the ALTITUDE goes blank. \nRyan punches a new set of commands. \nThe ALTITUDE now reads- 3 meters. \nRYAN (CONT'D) Okay. I only have one shot at this. One shot... \nShe extends her finger... \nRYAN(CONT'D) What's the point if we don't try? \nSHE PRESSES THE BUTTON. \nOUTER SPACE. \nA THREE SECOND THRUST ignites at the back of the cabin, pushing it at great speeds toward the Chinese Station. \nSOYUZ CONTROL CABIN. \nThe strength of the thrust pushes Ryan back in her seat. \nShe looks at- \nTHE PERISCOPE- \nThe Soyuz is approaching the Tiangong. The center of the crosshair is aiming three degrees above the Chinese Station. \nOUTER SPACE. \nThe Soyuz is making its way rapidly towards the Chinese Station. \nCONTROL CABIN. \nRyan is looking out of the window, at Earth- \nRYAN Wow... you were right Matt... it's magnificent.... \nShe then turns to- \nTHE PERISCOPE- The Chinese Station quickly grows in size as the Soyuz gets closer and closer. \nALTITUDE DIAL- 155 km and dropping. \nRYAN (CONT'D) You're losing altitude, Tiangong. You keep dropping and you're going to kiss the atmosphere. But not before I get to you. You have my last ride home. \nA new sense of urgency comes up on Ryan's face. \nShe unhooks the umbilical from her suit. \nShe unstraps herself. \nShe floats over and looks out of- \nTHE PORTHOLE- \nThe Chinese Station is approaching, getting closer. \nShe disarms the emergency exit and holds on to the LATCH. \nShe pauses and turns to grab the fire extinguisher and holds it tightly against her chest with one arm. With the other arm- \nShe reaches for the Latch. \nThe Station is hovering right next to her and the cabin is going to pass it. \nRYAN (CONT'D) Okay, I'm done with just driving. Let's get go home. \nShe turns the latch, and- \nPYROTECHNICS shoot the porthole into space. \nThe brutal force of the infinite VACUUM of space SUCKS THE AIR out of the cabin, and- \nRyan is LAUNCHED out of the cabin at a tremendous speed. \nHer outstretched arm reaching toward- \nTHE STATION- \nShe slowly drifts across the modules, the tips of her fingers almost touching the surface of the Tiangong. \nA handle passes under her, almost within reach, but she does not manage to hold onto it. INSIDE THE HELMET- \nShe's struggling, but she knows she's not going to make it. She looks ahead at- \nTHE STATION- \nA solar panel, following the rotation of the Station, comes into view. \nShe stretches out her arm as she gets closer to it. \nBut the solar panel continues its rotation and she is approaching very slowly. \nThe panel is rotating away. \nShe STRETCHES, and- \nShe GRABS onto a rod on the Solar Panel, STOPPING her momentum. \nRyan hangs from the Station. She holds her right arm tightly to her chest. \nINSIDE THE HELMET- \nShe catches her breath and is clearly in pain. \nRYAN SEES- \nA LONESOME PIECE OF DEBRIS. \nIt hovers above the Station and glows as the sunlight hits its surface. It passes very quickly. \nAnd there's ANOTHER ONE cruising farther above. \nShe pulls her right arm up. \nRYAN Ahhhhhh! \nThe pain is excruciating, but she grabs onto the panel's rod, AND- \nSHE PULLS HERSELF UP, and clinging with her leg, she secures herself to the panel. \nINSIDE THE HELMET- \nShe's panting, and through the fogged up glass she can see, far away over the horizon- \nBRIGHT DOTS. Pieces of debris burn as they hit the atmosphere. A swarm of incandescent locusts that- \nIs coming directly at her. \nIgnoring her pain but using her right arm as little as possible, she climbs up to- \nTHE BODY OF THE STATION. \nShe goes over the module and makes her way across, pulling herself from handle to handle. \nWhen she reaches the end of it, with one last BIG PULL she makes it to the- \nHATCH that leads into the airlock. \nWith her bad arm she holds onto a handle. \nWith the other, she pulls on the latch and- \nOPENS THE AIRLOCK. \nA gust of AIR bursts out, pushing the hatch wide open. \nRyan holds on tightly to the handle. \nABOVE HER- \nClusters of DEBRIS pass by, flying at different distances and at great speeds. \nPieces COLLIDE with each other, exploding into more debris. \nA BIG PIECE OF DEBRIS is flying downward, missing the Station by ten meters as it continues its descent. And- \n250 meters below, it BURNS like a shooting star. \nLOOP \nShe enters the hatch into the- TIANGONG LAB MODULE. \nThe only light is coming from flickering emergency lights. Objects float in chaos. \nRyan makes her way, dodging the disarray of lab objects- \nScientific instruments: A plant drifting by with its roots exposed, clusters of liquid floating like wobbly spheres, two eggs hovering, one of which is broken. \nTHE SHAKING INTENSIFIES as- \nShe reaches the end of the module and goes into the- \nTIANGONG NODE 2. \nShe floats to the center of the node. \nThere are three open hatches- RIGHT, LEFT, and- \nBELOW- \nA Docking Module, very similar to the one in the ISS. At the far end of it an open hatch leads into the SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD. \nMORE RUMBLING SHAKES THE STATION. \nOUTER SPACE. \nA SOLAR PANEL, defeated by the friction with the atmosphere, breaks off from the Station and is thrown farther down, where it quickly burns, dissolving into sparks. \nThe TIDAL WAVE of debris is catching up with the Station, a cloud of metal pieces that sparkle with the sunlight. \nBRIGHT STREAKS can be seen as debris burns, scratching through the atmosphere. \nTIANGONG NODE 2. \nRyan springs into the- \nDOCKING MODULE. \nFloating through it and reaching the open hatch at the other end, she tosses the helmet inside the Shenzhou. \nA LOUD METALLIC ROAR. The Station is collapsing. She dives through the hatch into the- SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD. AIRLOCK. \nIt is almost identical to the Soyuz's airlock. \nShe does a quick flip and- \nCLOSES the outer hatch. \nThen she pulls on another latch and- \nCLOSES the inner hatch. \nThe Shenzhou is SEALED OFF from the rest of the Station. \nShe throws the helmet into the Control Cabin and follows through, into the- \nSHENZHOU ESCAPE POD. CONTROL CABIN. \nShe struggles to turn around in the confined space, and then- \nShe pulls the hatch CLOSED. \nTHE CONTROL CABIN IS SEALED. \nThe Shenzhou is smaller than the Soyuz and has only one seat. In this confined space, the SHAKING of the station is felt even stronger. \nShe sits, BUCKLES herself in, and looks at the- \nCONTROL PANEL. \nIt has more monitors than the Soyuz's panel, and the main board is arranged differently. All of the buttons are labeled with CHINESE IDEOGRAMS. \nAND IT IS SHAKING FIERCELY. \nRYAN Seriously? \nTHROUGH- \nTHE PORTHOLE- \nA thin bright yellow halo covers the whole window. \nAs the cabin RATTLES VIOLENTLY. \nRYAN (CONT'D) Because either way-- \nShe closes her eyes, puts her finger over the button. \nRYAN (CONT'D) It'll be one hell of a ride. \nRyan presses the button. \nRYAN (CONT'D) I'm ready. \nOUTER SPACE. \nThe Station is bouncing over the atmosphere. One end of it is glowing more brightly and catches FIRE. \nThe TIDE OF DEBRIS is getting closer. Not far off some pieces are already burning. \nA LARGE PIECE OF DEBRIS has caught on fire and is flying at great speed and- \nCOLLIDES WITH THE STATION, Tearing it into two parts, which are sent twisting in opposite directions. The ESCAPE POD, attached to the DOCK, is spinning towards earth. \nSHENZHOU ESCAPE POD. \nRyan is SHAKEN and RATTLED in her seat. \nRYAN Yeehaaa! \nGRAVITY is still minimal, but the force of the inertia is rough and it jerks her around. She sees- \nA RED LEVER above her, but she can only reach it with her bad hand. \nSHE STRETCHES \nRYAN (CONT'D) Ahhhhhhhh! \nSHE GRABS THE LEVER- \nAND PULLS IT. \nOUTER SPACE. \nTHE LOCKS DISENGAGE- \nTHE CABIN separates from the rest of the vessel and from the Station. It spins away, plummeting toward the atmosphere. \nThe two fragments of the Tiangong follow, spinning in a rage of sparks and fire. \nSHENZHOU ESCAPE POD. \nThe spinning is punishing. Ryan is shaken violently. She is also mumbling words to herself that we can't hear. It looks like she rambling. \nSome LIGHTS GO OFF. \nATMOSPHERE. 130 KM ABOVE THE EARTH. \nThe capsule's aerodynamics slow down the spinning, positioning the vessel nose up. \nIt cuts through the atmosphere at incredible speeds. Its metal is burning hot. \nSmoldering DEBRIS and the fragments of the STATION chase the Shenzhou in its descent. \nSHENZHOU ESCAPE POD. \nTHE PORTHOLE- \nA blinding light pours in from outside the window. \nThe spinning is over, but the cabin vibrates with a loud rumble. \nAs the G-Force restrains Ryan against her seat, she clenches her face and sweats. \nOn the ceiling, condensation begins to form. \nATMOSPHERE. 120 KM ABOVE THE EARTH. \nThe Shenzhou is a ball of fire precipitating from the skies. \nIt's followed very closely by DEBRIS and the two fragments of the STATION. \nThe TWO FRAGMENTS COLLIDE and EXPLODE into a ball of fire that breaks into many pieces. \nAn avalanche of fire cascades towards the Shenzhou, rapidly closing the distance. \nShe UNSTRAPS herself and- \nReaches a LEVER at the side of the hatch. \nShe PULLS THE LEVER. ON THE LAKE. \nWith a small controlled explosion, the hatch cover is launched away from the cabin. \nSmoke pours out through the open hatch. \nSHENZHOU ESCAPE POD. \nShe begins to unstrap herself when- \nWATER POURS IN through the open hatch. \nShe tries to make her way out, fighting against the strong current that is gushing in, but the flow is too strong and- \nIT PUSHES HER BACK IN. \nShe struggles to force her way through the cascade rapidly filling the cabin, but it is too strong. \nTHE CABIN IS OVERFLOWING. \nThe water has reached Ryan's chin when- \nShe manages to take ONE LAST DEEP BREATH of air before- \nWATER COMPLETELY FILLS IT. \nUNDERWATER \nThe metallic capsule, which weighs almost three tons, sinks quickly into the lake. As the ropes of the parachute tense, the long fabric follows the cabin down. \nSHENZHOU ESCAPE POD. \nAir trapped inside Ryan's suit leaks out through the collar and small bubbles float up. \nRyan fights her way to the hatch, and pulling with her good arm, she swims out. \nUNDERWATER. \nShe pushes herself away from the cabin, swimming away from the POD AS- \nTHE SHENZHOU HITS THE LAKE BOTTOM. A dark cloud of mud swells up around it. \nRyan struggles to SWIM UP to the surface, but she can only use one arm and the wet suit is DRAGGING HER DOWN. \nShe strokes rapidly, but she isn't moving up. Instead- \nSHE'S GOING DOWN, and \nHER FEET SINK INTO THE LAKE BED. \nShe looks up and sees- \nThe rays of sunlight breaking through the lake's surface are eclipsed by the parachute, which floats down toward her like a huge jellyfish about to engulf its pray. \nTHE FROG crosses in front of her, effortlessly swimming on its way to the surface. \nSmall bubbles of air come out of Ryan's nose as she struggles to open her suit. \nShe takes off the BOTTOM PART of the suit. \nABOVE HER- \nTHE PARACHUTE IS GETTING CLOSER, a net about to trap her. \nShe struggles out of the TOP PART of her suit. And squirming out from under it- \nShe frees herself from the heavy garments and SWIMS UP as- \nTHE SINKING PARACHUTE traps her foot and begins dragging her down. But with a kick- \nSHE SETS HERSELF FREE, and- \nSHE SWIMS UP, stroking with her good arm. She is completely out of breath, only the tiniest bubbles rise from her nose. \nShe is about to lose consciousness, when she sees- \nTHE FROG swimming ahead of her, sliding smoothly through the water toward the rays of sunlight diffracted by the surface. \nRyan's eyes are closed as she floats up, her body limp. The surface is coming closer and closer. \n", "test1_input": "Matt laughs softly. \nWe arrive back on him as he turns back to look at Earth. Something flickers briefly in Matt's eyes-- something COMPLICATED-- \nMATT Hmmmm. Terrific. \nRyan inspects a panel inside the telescope, studying it with a small mirror. \nRYAN Houston, from first inspection comms panel appears to be dead. Am I a go to cut link to auxiliary? MISSION CONTROL You're the expert, doctor. It's your call. \nRyan takes out the small mirror and Matt stretches his arm, offering assistance, but- \nShe does not want any help and puts the mirror away in her toolbox, leaving Matt with his arm outstretched. \nRyan starts looking for another tool, but Matt is one move ahead of her, offering her a pair of tweezers. \nRyan hesitates and takes the tool. She starts working on the panel. \nMATT Houston, I have a bad feeling about this mission. \nMISSION CONTROL Please elaborate. \nMATT It's the same feeling I had at Mardi Gras in 1987...? \nHe waits, letting the moment hang knowingly. Then: \nMISSION CONTROL That is affirmative. Surprisingly, control hasn't heard the Mardi Gras story. Please proceed. \nMATT Well, it's day one and I'm bumping my way down Bourbon Street looking for the sister of a friend of mine. The streets are swimming with people, I'm thinking there's no way I'm finding this girl... \nRyan rolls her eyes and mumbles to herself- \nRYAN Proceeding to over ride. \nMatt continues his story without missing a beat- \nMATT Then all of a sudden I look up and -- there she is. (MORE) MATT (CONT'D) I am about to yell out when I notice she's holding hands with a short hairy guy in board shorts and a Margaritaville T-shirt. Then I realize, the guy's no guy. My sister's friend is holding hands with a-- \nMission Control interrupts on the radio. \nMISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO) ISS, this is Houston. \nSPACE STATION CAP (ON RADIO) Zlotze Houston. \nRyan inserts the plate into the Hubble. \nMISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO) Explorer, this is Houston. \nEXPLORER CAP (ON RADIO) Go ahead Houston. \nMISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO) Mission abort. Repeat: mission abort.

Start Deorbit Prep for PLS at Kennedy. ISS, initiate emergency evacuation. \nMatt is immediately flung into action and rapidly unharnesses himself from the Hubble. \nEXPLORER CAP (ON RADIO) Copy all Houston, and in work. Matt, immediate return to Explorer. Repeat, immediate return to Explorer. \nMATT Roger. Explorer, prep airlock! EXPLORER CAP (ON RADIO) Airlock engaged--ready to receive. \nRyan is working on the panel. \nMATT Houston. Elaborate. \nMISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO) Debris from the impact has caused a chain reaction, hitting other satellites in its path and creating new debris. Norad reports that orbital and ballistic effects are driving the cloud of debris up toward your altitude. How copy? \nMATT Copy all Houston. (TO RYAN) Put a bow on it Dr. Stone. \nRYAN I can't. If I turn it off now we'll lose the whole system. \nShe keeps on furiously tweaking. \nMATT I'm not going to ask you again. \nRYAN ONE SECOND-- \nMATT Not one second. Now! Shut it down! THAT'S AN ORDER!!! \nShe looks up, sees Matt glaring. Looks him in the eye. \nRYAN Sorry. I'm sorry. It's done. \n", "test1_true": "Matt watches her go, then: EXPLORER CAP (ON RADIO) Kowalsky, initiate emergency disconnect from the Hubble. \nMATT Alright Shariff, let's do this. \nSHARIFF Roger. \nShariff turns and heads toward the base of the telescope holding onto the hangar's handrails. \nMATT Houston. Update. \nMatt PROPELS himself to the base of the Hubble using the propelling unit on his back. \nMISSION CONTROL We have a full on chain reaction. It's been confirmed that it is the unintentional side effect of the Russians striking one of their own satellites. \nShariff arrives to the base of the telescope. \nSHARIFF They shot down their own satellite? \nMATT Right of disposal. Most likely a spy sat gone bad. Now it's space junk. \nMatt grabs onto the base of the telescope- \nMATT (CONT'D) Explorer, ready to disengage HST. \nEXPLORER CAP (ON RADIO) Locks releasing in three... two... one... \nThe locks attaching the Hubble to the Explorer release. Matt and Shariff give the Hubble a push away from the hangar. Pushing the huge telescope is not a difficult task in zero gravity. \nMISSION CONTROL Explorer, new data coming through. \nAs it floats away, Matt gives the telescope a small spin. MATT What's the blowback, Houston? \nMISSION CONTROL It's not good. Most of our systems are going down. Debris chain reaction is out of control and rapidly expanding. Multiple sats are now down and they keep on falling. \nMatt eyes the arm as it slowly retracts, carrying Ryan back. \nMATT Define \"multiple\" sats. \nMISSION CONTROL Most of them. Telecomunications systems are gone. Expect a communication blackout at any moment. \nRYAN Kowalsky, visual of debris at nine o'clock. \nMatt's eyes shift, watching a LARGE OBJECT, a piece of a BSE SATELLITE, spiral toward them. \nMATT Half of North America just lost their Facebook. \nThe sat glides by at tremendous speed. \nMISSION CONTROL You're a go for TH1138. Repeat You're a go for TH1138 procedure. \nEXPLORER CAP Copy that Houston. \nMATT Explorer, this is Kowalsky. Confirming visual contact with debris. Debris is from a BSE sat. To repeat-- \nSHARIFF Heads up! \nMATT To repeat I have- \nANOTHER OBJECT, part of a WEATHER SATELLITE, hurls by them, a little bit closer than the previous one. RYAN Dr. Stone requesting faster, faster transport. \nIt is followed by a SMALL PIECE OF DEBRIS. It zooms by faster than the previous ones and hits the BSE SATELLITE. \nThe satellite EXPLODES into hundreds of pieces and- \nA CHAIN REACTION takes place. \nMATT We have to go. Go, go! Go! \nThe DEBRIS from the BSE satellite hits the WEATHER SATELLITE, and it EXPLODES, sending debris in all directions. \nMISSION CONTROL Attention. New data suggests immediate evacuation absolu... \nA high frequency of interference and- \nTHE COMMUNICATION IS LOST. \nTHE ARM transporting Ryan is moving very slowly. \nRYAN Dr. Stone requesting faster transport to the bay area.

You can't tune out the world up here. \nShe reaches for the last clip and begins to undo it. \nRYAN I'm trying... \nMATT Try releasing the safety clip. \nShariff makes his way back toward the airlock as- \nA PIECE of the debris HITS the Hubble's SOLAR PANELS, making a 12-inch HOLE in its golden surface. \nA piece of debris passes, nearly hitting them. \nSHARIFF Need some help there Matt? \nMATT No, don't wait for us. Get inside. \nRYAN It's stuck! \nFurther back, another piece of debris collides with a bigger one. The two chunks of debris explode into a million pieces of shrapnel, one of which- \nHITS Shariff's helmet, breaking through the glass and hitting his head like an expansive bullet. \nMATT Man down! Man down! \nMatt PROPELS himself toward Shariff, who is floating away from the Shuttle unconscious. \nMATT (CONT'D) (TO RYAN) Disengage!!! \nAN IMPACT. A piece of debris pierces through the right wing of the Space Shuttle, creating a five-foot hole. \nTHE SPACE SHUTTLE ROLLS. \nThe arm, with Ryan attached to it, rolls with the Shuttle. \nMATT (CONT'D) Explorer has been hit. Explorer do you read? Explorer, over. Explorer-- \nAnother IMPACT. \nA piece of debris HITS the robotic arm like a cannon ball and DETACHES it from the Shuttle. \nThe broken piece of the arm SPINS AWAY from the Explorer at a great speed with Ryan attached to it. She passes next to- \nTHE HUBBLE as a big piece of debris hits the telescope. The top of the cylinder explodes into more debris, which is expelled in all directions, barely missing Ryan as she spins away attached to the arm. \nON THE ARM- \nRyan's panic grows as she spins further into the nothingness of space. \nMATT (CONT'D) Astronaut off structure! Dr. Stone is off structure! \nWith every spin, the shuttle, being punished by debris, diminishes into a tiny dot in the distance. \nMATT (CONT'D) (ON RADIO) Dr. Stone, detach! \nRYAN Nooooo! \nMATT (ON RADIO) You must detach! \nRYAN No. \nMATT If you don't detach that arm is going to carry you too far! RYAN (FROZEN) I can't! \nMATT (a brief beat, then) Listen to my voice. You need to focus. I'm losing visual of you. In a few seconds I won't be able to track you. \nRYAN (She pulls herself together) Ok. Ok. \nMATT You need to detach. I can't see you anymore. \nThe robotic arm keeps on spinning and stars orbit wildly in her field of vision. \n", "test2_true": "MATT Do it. Now! \nRYAN Ok. I'm trying! I can't it's stuck, Hold on. \nRyan's hands are trembling and she can't get a grip on the hook. \nMATT Houston, I've lost visual of Dr. Stone... Houston, I've lost visual of Dr. Stone. \nAs Matt's VOICE is LOST to STATIC, Ryan squeezes the hook and is... \n...gone, kicking herself AWAY from the robotic arm and FLYING FREE of the rotating arm. She catches a brief glimpse of the arm as it helicopters away, then loses sight of it as she rotates end over end in endless free fall. \nA PRIMAL SCREAM of God forsaken fear erupts from her lungs. \nThe RADIO CRACKLES and Matt's VOICE returns. \nMATT (CONT'D) Dr. Stone! Do you copy?! Repeat! Do you copy? RYAN Yes. Yes. I copy. I'm detached! \nRyan slowly spins, drifting into the empty darkness of space. \nMATT ...Give me your position! \nRYAN I don't know. I don't know! I'm spinning. I can't. I can't. \nMATT Report your position. \nTumbling end over end, Ryan fixes her gaze on her wrist. The effort makes her nauseous. She looks away. \nRYAN GPS is...down. I can't, it's down, I can't. \nMATT Give me a visual. \nMatt's faint voice is heard on the transmission under a lot of static. Ryan is panicking and begins to hyperventilate. Her eyes rake the dark sameness of her surroundings. \nRYAN I told you! Nothing. I see nothing! \nMATT Do you have a visual of Explorer? \nRYAN NO-- \nMATT Do you have a visual of ISS? \nRYAN NO-- \nAs Matt's signal grows fainter her breathing becomes more labored. \nMATT I need you to focus. Give me a visual... anything. \nRyan's eyes flutter, then roll up into her sockets... RYAN It's too fast. \nINSIDE THE HELMET- \nRyan swallows harshly, her throat suddenly dry. \nRYAN (CONT'D) I can't breathe. I can't...breathe... \nShe inhales and exhales with quick short breaths- \nAHHHH... OHHHH \nAHHHH... OHHHH \nRyan's eyes are wide open and desperate as her breathing accelerates. \nAHH... OHH... AHH... OHH \nAHH... OHH... AHH... OHH \nHer limbs look fragile against the black and incalculable void. \nAHH... OHH... AHH... OHH \nShe inhales. \nAHH... \nAnd her throat closes. \nHH... \nHer mouth is open, but she cannot exhale. \nNot a breath. \n", "test3_input": "MATT I can't. Can's empty. We're coming in fast and we're going to hit hard. Grab onto anything you can and hold tight! \nJust then Ryan CRASHES against the SOLAR PANEL, but is unable to grab hold. As she tumbles past, the body of the Station looms. \nMatt misses the solar panels, and COLLIDES against the Station. As he begins to drift past, he reaches out and snares a railing. \nRyan passes flying above him. The tether tenses, pulling Matt. The momentum is to great and he LETS GO of the railing. \nRyan floats over the roof of the Space Station, trying to grab hold of the handles and rods that stick out of the modules, but she's floating too high. \nShe's quickly reaching the end of the Station, there is only one handle left ahead, her last chance before floating away into the black void. \nShe extends her arm and GRABS the handle tightly for dear life AND- \nSHE STOPS. \nShe's holding onto the handle. \nRYAN I got it. I got it. \nINSIDE THE HELMET- \nShe looks up and sees- \nMatt is floating straight toward her and- He COLLIDES against her. For a moment they are face to face, only the glass of their headgear separates their faces. \nBut she loses her grip on the handle and the impact projects her into the emptiness. \nHer drifting is intercepted by a Solar Panel. She crashes against it, shattering it, as Matt rolls above it. \nRyan bounces down towards the Earth, tensing the tether, pulling Matt, making him descend over the other side of the panel. \nThe sharp edges of the broken panels cut the tether in two. \nRYAN (CONT'D) The tether broke. I'm detached. I'm I'm detached. \nMATT Grab a hold. Grab anything. \nRyan is drifting away from the Station. She sees the infinite black void ahead of her and- \nHER FOOT GETS STUCK IN THE PARACHUTE. \nIt becomes tangled in the strings and fabric, slowing her down. \nRyan is panting, her face covered in sweat. She turns back and SEES- \nMatt rolling, drifting in her direction. \nShe stretches out her arm. \nMatt's arm is also outstretched. \nMATT (CONT'D) (AN EDGE) Give me... give me five here, Ryan. \nHe's trying to make light of it, but he's really struggling to reach her. \nRyan stretches farther. \nMatt's hand comes closer to hers. \nThe tips of their fingers are almost touching. \nRYAN I've got you. I've got you-- \nThe very tips of their fingers touch -- BUT THEY MISS. \nAs Matt drifts past. \nMATT Shit... shit... \nRYAN No. No. No. Don't you. No. Don't you. Don't. Don't. NO \nAs the parachute tenses, she STOPS. \nThe tether attached to Matt's suit passes two feet away from her AND- \nRyan grabs the tether. It slides through her closed fist, until- \nHer grip tightens and the tether STOPS. \nRYAN (CONT'D) Gotcha! \nMatt's momentum is now pulling Ryan, dragging her loose from the parachute. \n", "test3_true": "RYAN What? No-- \nMATT You have to. \nRYAN No! \nMATT Those ropes are too loose, I'm pulling you with me. You have to let me go or we both die-- \nRYAN I'm not letting you go! We're fine. \nHer leg slides through the loose rope and she floats further out, being snagged at the last minute by a tether around her foot. (We move from high-angle to low angle two shot). As this HAPPENS: \nMATT Ryan! RYAN You're not going anywhere, you're not GOING ANYWHERE-- \nMATT It's not up to you. \nMatt begins to unharness the tether. \nRYAN Please don't do this. \nMatt has unhooked the tether and is holding it in his hand. \nRYAN (CONT'D) Please don't do this. Please don't do this. \nMATT You're going to make it Ryan. \nRYAN (O.S.) No! \nHe opens his hand, letting go of the tether, and BEGINS TO FLOAT AWAY. \nRelieved of Matt's pull, the parachute begins to retrieve, pulling Ryan closer to the Station. \nRYAN (CONT'D) I had you! I had you. \nMatt drifts away from the Station into the empty space. \nRyan bumps against the station, pulled by the parachute, and she twists and turns before finally grabbing hold of a rail. \nMATT (ON RADIO) Ryan do you copy? Do you copy? \nAn ALARM GOES OFF. \nRYAN My CO2 alarm went off. My CO2 alarm went off. \nMATT You need to board the station. Can you see the airlock? \nShe turns, looking for the Station's Airlock. MAT Do you copy? \n(P.O.V shot - beginning to blur) \nRYAN Yes. Yes. I see it. I see it. \nMATT (ON RADIO) Good. That's where you want to go. You're losing focus, right? \nRYAN Yes. \nMATT That's because you're breathing CO2 and you're losing consciousness. You need to board the Station. \nHer eyes flutter... \nMATT (CONT'D) (ON RADIO) Move! \nRyan blinks, TURNS OFF the ALARM, and begins climbing over a module of the Station. \nRYAN Ok. \nThe transmission becomes weaker, filled with STATIC. \nMATT (ON RADIO) Now listen to me. That second Soyuz is too damaged for re-entry, but it's perfectly fine for a little Sunday drive. \nRYAN Sunday drive...? \nMATT (ON RADIO) Look to the west... You see that dot in the distance? That is the Chinese Station. You're going to take the Soyuz and cruise over there. The Chinese lifeboat is a Shenzou. RYAN I've never flown a Shenzhou-- \nMATT (ON RADIO) That doesn't matter. Its re-entry protocol is identical to the Soyuz's-- \nShe nods, already looking. \nRYAN Ok. \nMATT (ON RADIO) You've never flown a Soyuz either. \nRYAN Only on a simulator. \n"}

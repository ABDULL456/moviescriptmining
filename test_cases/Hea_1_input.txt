Breedan floors it.

STATION WAGON 
draws everyone's FIRE.    Breedan ducks and pilots it through the gauntlet. 
NEIL 
has taken off down the sidewalk, supporting Chris. TIGHTEN. He runs in among crowds of civilians. He knocks over a man, breaks through. People are screaming, staring, shocked.

It spins across the street on steel rims and crashes sideways into a parked car on the east side of Hawthorne. 
INT. STATION WAGON - CERRITO 
shot three times, holds his abdomen and bails, returning FIRE. Breedan, like a rag doll is half over into the rear seat and still being hit by more rounds. We HOLD on David Breedan. He's dead. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SIDE STREET - CERRITO 
east up a side street past people who stand on their lawns and stare - traumatized.

EXT. SAFEWAY - TRACKING NEIL + CHRIS - DAY 
and the money - running, skipping and dodging past all manner of pedestrians, newspaper coin boxes, fruit vendors and parking meters. People dodge, scream and fall down. It's chaos. 
TRACKING HANNA 
a half block behind, chasing Neil - pushing through the same people. 
HANNA (shouts at pedestrians) Get down! Get down 
EXT. SAFEWAY PARKING LOT - NEIL + CHRIS 
Neil - supporting Chris - throws a lady, who was getting out, back into her Olds Cutlass. He dumps Chris and the money in the back seat and turns on Hanna. 
NEIL 
extends the collapsible stock braces on the roof for accuracy and FIRES over the roof of other cars and through people at Hanna closing in 5o yards away. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SAFEWAY - HANNA + CIVILIANS 
who panic. SHOOTING. Windows EXPLODE. A lady holds her ears and shrieks. A newspaper coin box SHATTERS. A man's bag of groceries explode milk and eggs everywhere. He goes down. 
HANNA 
doesn't have a clear shot and drops, dragging people down with him. 
NEIL 
behind the wheel - burns rubber pulling out of the lot over curbstones and through a fence into the alley. 
EXT. ALLEY - WIDE 
Suddenly Neil drives very normally and jerks the lady upright next to him like a wife. He drives away. 
HANNA 
runs to the alley - pulling his radio:

HANNA (into radio) This is Hanna! (no response; shakes it) Come in...

Cerrito runs TO CAMERA through kids playing in a front yard, looking over his shoulder at Drucker and Bosko who can't fire because of the kids. 
CERRITO 
up a girl out of the yard. 
CERRITO (nice) C'mere, honey. 
She's the   same age as his own daughters. He holds her to his chest   with one arm as a shield against Drucker and Bosko. He    FIRES a wild THREE SHOT BURST running up the sidewalk.    Meanwhile: 
EXT. ALLEY - HANNA 
emerges,   cuts right. He brings up his 9mm. Smith and Wesson.    He slows. He stops. Hear his BREATHING. WIDEN and PAN   AROUND. Cerrito is running right at Hanna and doesn't   see him. 
OVER HANNA'S SHOULDER: CERRITO'S 
attention on Drucker and Bosko. Cerrito FIRES. The little girl sees Hanna because he's aiming the 9mm. directly at her with both hands. She stares into his eyes. 
CERRITO 
turns, sees Hanna. He starts swinging around the H & K on its shoulder strap.. 
HANNA 
FIRES ONCE.

WIDE - CERRITO 
is hit dead center in the forehead and topples backwards like a felled oak. The little girl falls half on and off his dead chest, screaming. 
WIDE - HANNA, DRUCKER + BOSKO

Maurice rests on an abandoned tractor by the side of the road and watches the wind change the fields.  He closes his jacket as the gusts become stronger.

HOTEL 
The clock clicks past 11:30 am.  Maurice is still in bed -- the curtains drawn.  He crawls out from under the sheets and downs two pills with a glass of water.  He looks bad.  His face pale, his eyes at half-mast.  He wipes unnatural sweat from his brow and melts into the bed again.

STREET 
Just after dusk.  A small town's main road.  Maurice quietly passes under the street lights. 
He stares up and tightens the hood on his parka as the first SNOWFLAKE falls into the SHAFT OF THE STREET LIGHT.  Soon thousands of flakes fall into the light...

GAZETTE BUILDING 
Kris fields calls frantically as the LIGHTS BLINK ANXIOUSLY on his phone.  The front page of the Gazette is posted on his pin up board.  It reads... "HE MARCHES ON..."  Underneath is A PICTURE of Maurice standing outside his bookstore holding up THE BOOK SOCIETY MEDALLION proudly. 
A teenage boy gets off the elevator and maneuvers an enormous bag over his shoulder... emblazoned across his back are the words "MAIL ROOM."  The boy comes to Kris and empties the bag on Kris' desk without a word.  Hundreds of letters cascade down swallowing the table top and covering Kris who stares in awe as the letters keep coming.

MOTEL 
Maurice is COUGHING PAINFULLY.  He crouches over the edge of the bed and holds his side with every strain. 
Maurice looks worse than ever.  His hair and shirt are soaked with sweat.  The coughing attack stops.  Maurice take a couple deep breaths before laying back down. 
His feet are visible -- sticking out from beneath the sheets. They look like someone has beaten them with a stick, swollen and bruised.  They disappear under the sheets.

CUT TO: 
EXT.  STREET - DAY 
Early morning.  The branches of the trees are encapsulated in ice.  The snow piled ten inches on every surface.  Maurice, buried deep beneath three layers of clothes, looks around. His breath materializes with every step.  He forces a weak smile at the magical landscape before him.  White.  Pure. Peaceful. 
The SOUNDS OF A VOLVO STATION WAGON urges Maurice to the side of the road.  As it passes a little girl waves from the passenger window.  Maurice puts on a brave face and waves back. 
Another CAR ENTERS the picture -- A DARK BLUE FIREBIRD rises over the hill in the opposite lane moving fast, too fast. 
SLOW-MOTION as the Firebird skids over the ice and the snow -- the driver desperately trying to gain control... The mother in the Volvo hits the BRAKES as the Firebird spins into her lane... Maurice yells out. 
MAURICE No! 
The cars IMPACT with a sickening CRUNCH -- BACK TO REAL TIME: 
The Firebird spins into a guardrail, breaking through it and coming to a stop in a bank of snow. 
The Volvo isn't so lucky.  It flips from the impact... sliding on its roof, driving through the snow, down the road... It comes to a rest a hundred feet away. 
SILENCE.  STILLNESS.  The entire event took only seconds. 
Maurice runs frantically after the Volvo.  The windows are SHATTERED.  Snow has packed into the over-turned car.  No one can be seen inside the vehicle. 
Maurice kneels down and punctures the wall of snow with his hand.  His arm disappears up to the shoulder.  His face grimacing with the strain.  His arm comes out slowly... 
A few MUFFLED SOBS ARE HEARD BEFORE the little girl breaks through the wall of snow and slides out of the window.  She lets out a DESPERATE GASP for air as Maurice pulls her out by the wrist. 
Maurice clears her mouth and face and watches as she coughs. 
MAURICE (panting) It's okay.  It's all over. 
Maurice lays her gently against a snow bank, before moving to the other side of the car. 
DRIVER (O.S.) Is she okay? 
Maurice looks up to see the driver of the Firebird walking towards him.  He looks dazed. 
Maurice doesn't waste another second and plunges his arm in the snow... deeper than before.  His cheek pressed against the snow, almost laying flat on the ground. 
MAURICE (frantic) Oh no... she's wearing a seat-belt. 
Maurice fishes around... his teeth clenched... He lets out a POWERFUL GRUNT as he pulls back with all his strength -- a woman's WRIST appears first, then the tangled hair and then the body spills out onto the road next to Maurice. 
The driver appears over the Woman and Maurice and loses it when he sees them. 
DRIVER It wasn't my fault.  It wasn't my fault. 
Maurice, out of breath, clears the woman's face and mouth -- no movement.  No sound. 
MAURICE Come on... please... 
Maurice holds her nose and breaths into her mouth... 
MAURICE Please...

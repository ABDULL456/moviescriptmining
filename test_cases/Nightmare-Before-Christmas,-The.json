{"train": "The script to Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas \nNARRATOR 'Twas a long time ago, longer now than it seems, in a place that perhaps you've seen in your dreams.  For the story that you are about to be told, took place in the holiday worlds of old.  Now, you've probably wondered where holidays come from.  If you haven't, I'd say it's time you begun. \nThis Is Halloween \nSHADOW Boys and girls of every age Wouldn't you like to see something strange? \nSIAMESE SHADOW Come with us and you will see This, our town of Halloween \nPUMPKIN PATCH CHORUS This is Halloween, this is Halloween Pumpkins scream in the dead of night \nGHOSTS This is Halloween, everybody make a scene Trick or treat till the neighbors gonna die of fright It's our town, everybody scream In this town of Halloween \nCREATURE UNDER BED I am the one hiding under your bed Teeth ground sharp and eyes glowing red \nMAN UNDER THE STAIRS I am the one hiding under your stairs Fingers like snakes and spiders in my hair \nCORPSE CHORUS This is Halloween, this is Halloween Halloween! Halloween! Halloween! Halloween! \nVAMPIRES In this town we call home Everyone hail to the pumpkin song \nMAYOR In this town, don't we love it now? Everybody's waiting for the next surprise \nCORPSE CHORUS Round that corner, man hiding in the trash can Something's waiting now to pounce, and how you'll scream \nHARLEQUIN DEMON, WEREWOLF, AND MELTING MAN Scream! This is Halloween Red 'n' black, slimy green \nCORPSE CHILD TRIO In this town we call home Everyone hail to the pumpkin song \nEVERYONE La la-la la, Halloween! Halloween! (etc.) \nEVERYONE [applause] \nWITCHES Cackling \nCLOWN It's over! \nBEHEMOTH We did it! \n[tummy bump] \nWEREWOLF Wasn't it terrifying? \nHYDE & CYCLOPS What a night! \nMAYOR Great Halloween everybody. \nJACK I believe it was our most horrible yet!  Thank you everyone. \nMAYOR No, thanks to  you, Jack.  Without your brilliant leadership - \nJACK Not at all Mayor. \nVAMPIRE (fat) You're such a scream, Jack \nJACK Yeah, I guess so.  Just like last year and the year before that and the year before that. \n[entering graveyard] \nJack's Lament Performed by Danny Elfman \nThere are few who'd deny, at what I do I am the best For my talents are renowned far and wide When it comes to surprises in the moonlit night \nI excel without ever even trying With the slightest little effort of my ghostlike charms I have seen grown men give out a shriek With the wave of my hand, and a well-placed moan I have swept the very bravest off their feet \nYet year after year, it's the same routine And I grow so weary of the sound of screams And I, Jack, the Pumpkin King Have grown so tired of the same old thing \nOh, somewhere deep inside of these bones An emptiness began to grow There's something out there, far from my home A longing that I've never known \nI'm the master of fright, and a demon of light And I'll scare you right out of your pants To a guy in Kentucky, I'm Mister Unlucky And I'm known throughout England and France \nAnd since I am dead, I can take off my head To recite Shakespearean quotations No animal nor man can scream like I can With the fury of my recitations \nBut who here would ever understand That the Pumpkin King with the skeleton grin Would tire of his crown, if they only understood He'd give it all up if he only could \nOh, there's an empty place in my bones That calls out for something unknown The fame and praise come year after year Does nothing for these empty tears \n[leaving graveyard and entering forest] \nSALLY Jack, I know how you feel. \n[Sally gathers herbs] \nZERO bark \nJACK All right.  [giving Zero a rib from himself]  Here ya go boy. \n[Zero gets rib and shows off his nose] \n[Back to Halloweentown] \nMAYOR Morning gents [to the band] \n[humming This Is Halloween, walks up to Jack's front door and rings bell] \nMAYOR Jack, you home? \n[getting worried, switches face and knocks with desperation then switch back to happy face] \nMAYOR Jack?  I've got the plans for next Halloween.  I need to go over them with you so we can get started. \nMAYOR (with worried face) Jack, please, I'm only an elected an official here, I can't make decisions by myself.  Jack, answer me!! \n[falls down steps] \nACCORDION PLAYER He's not home. \nMAYOR Where is he? \nSAX PLAYER He hasn't been home all night. \nThere's frost on every window Oh, I can't believe my eyes And in my bones I feel the warmth That's coming from inside \nOh, look What's this? They're hanging mistletoe, they kiss Why that looks so unique, inspired They're gathering around to hear a story Roasting chestnuts on a fire What's this? \nWhat's this? In here they've got a little tree, how queer And who would ever think And why? \nThey're covering it with tiny little things They've got electric lights on strings And there's a smile on everyone So, now, correct me if I'm wrong This looks like fun This looks like fun Oh, could it be I got my wish? What's this? \nOh my, what now? The children are asleep But look, there's nothing underneath No ghouls, no witches here to scream and scare them Or ensnare them, only little cozy things Secure inside their dreamland What's this? \nThe monsters are all missing And the nightmares can't be found And in their place there seems to be Good feeling all around \nInstead of screams, I swear I can hear music in the air The smell of cakes and pies Are absolutely everywhere \nThe sights, the sounds They're everywhere and all around I've never felt so good before This empty place inside of me is filling up I simply cannot get enough \nI want it, oh, I want it Oh, I want it for my own I've got to know I've got to know What is this place that I have found? What is this? Christmas Town, hmm... \nSANDY CLAWS Ho Ho Ho Ho ho ho ho ho \nJACK hmm.. \n[Halloweentown] \nCLOWN This has never happened before. \nWitch It's suspicious. \nSALLY Coming....lunch \nDR. FINKELSTEIN Ah, what's that?  Worm's wart, mmm, and...frog's breath. \nSALLY What's wrong?  I-I thought you liked frog's breath. \nDR. FINKELSTEIN Nothing's more suspicious than frog's breath. Until you taste it I won't swallow a spoonful. \nSALLY I'm not hungry... [knocking spoon]  Oops! \nDR. FINKELSTEIN You want me to starve.  An old man like me who hardly has strength as it is.  Me, to whom you owe your very life. \nSALLY Oh don't be silly.  [eats soup with trick spoon]  Mmmm, see.  Scrumptious. \n[Dr. Finkelstein eats soup] \n[Halloween] \nMAYOR Did anyone think to dredge the lake? \nVAMPIRE Ah, this morning! \nZERO barks \nWitch Hear that? \nWitch (little) What? \nThis is a thing called a present The whole thing starts with a box \nDEVIL A box? is it steel? \nWEREWOLF Are there locks? \nHARLEOUIN DEMON Is it filled with a pox? \nDEVIL, WEREWOLF, HARLEQUIN DEMON A pox How delightful, a pox \nJACK If you please Just a box with bright-colored paper And the whole thing's topped with a bow \nWITCHES A bow? But why? How ugly What's in it? What's in it? \nJACK That's the point of the thing, not to know \nCLOWN It's a bat Will it bend? \nCREATURE UNDER THE STAIRS It's a rat Will it break? \nUNDERSEA GAL Perhaps it s the head that I found in the lake \nJACK Listen now, you don't understand That's not the point of Christmas land \nNow, pay attention We pick up an oversized sock And hang it like this on the wall \nMR. HYDE Oh, yes! Does it still have a foot? \nSimple objects, nothing more But something's hidden through a door Though I do not have the key Something's there I cannot see What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? Hmm... \nI've read these Christmas books so many times I know the stories and I know the rhymes I know the Christmas carols all by heart My skull's so full, it's tearing me apart As often as I've read them, something's wrong So hard to put my bony finger on \nOr perhaps it's really not as deep As I've been led to think Am I trying much too hard? Of course! I've been too close to see The answer's right in front of me Right in front of me \nIt's simple really, very clear Like music drifting in the air Invisible, but everywhere Just because I cannot see it Doesn't mean I can't believe it \nYou know, I think this Christmas thing It's not as tricky as it seems And why should they have all the fun? It should belong to anyone \nNot anyone, in fact, but me Why, I could make a Christmas tree And there's no reason I can find I couldn't handle Christmas time \nI bet I could improve it too And that's exactly what I'll do Hee,hee,hee \nJACK Eureka!!  This year, Christmas will be ours! \nMAYOR Patience, everyone.  Jack has a special Job for each of us.  Dr. Finkelstein, your Xmas assignment is ready.

ROYCE We in the D.A.'s office are still reeling from the events of this morning, as you can imagine. It's a tragic day for us...for our city... 
133   EXT. TRAIN STATION PLATFORM - DAY                                 133 
Kell and Emma on the platform, Garza hovering nearby, CROWDS swarming around them as boarding calls come over the P.A. system. Kell is looking around, anxious. 
Nick appears on the platform, hurrying. They see him. Emma runs, throws herself into Nick's arms as he crouches. 
EMMA I wanna see Sarah... 
NICK Hey, hey...she's fine, don't be scared. That's not allowed. And there's no reason for it. 
EMMA This sucks. 
NICK I know. 
EMMA Why do we have to go? 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                       85. 
NICK 'Cause your mom wants to see a few Broadway shows. You gonna begrudge her that? 
EMMA You're kinda full of shit, Dad. 
Nick's taken aback -- not sure whether to laugh. He trades a look with Kell, who's too tense with worry to care. 
NICK Okay, you're right. Maybe I am a little. But only a little. The part you can believe is that this is all going to be fine. Sarah, us. (directed at Kell) I mean it. Okay? 
EMMA Okay. 
She detaches from her father. Nick rises to Kell, pulls an envelope, hands it to her... 
NICK No credit cards. Too easy to track. Meals, hotel, whatever -- pay cash. 
...then takes her cell, swaps it for Royce's... 
NICK I'll keep this. It can be traced. Use this one instead. Don't answer unless you see it's me.                           * 
P.A. VOICE FINAL BOARDING CALL FOR NEW YORK CITY DIRECT, FINAL CALL... 
KELL Anything else? 
NICK I love you. 
KELL Emma's right. This sucks. 
She embraces him, fears and emotions swirling. 
KELL Be goddamn careful. 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                          86. 
She breaks the embrace. Nick stands, watching them get on the train. The doors close. The train starts out... 
Nick turns. Garza's been watching -- a look of sympathy for what Nick's going through... 
134   INT. TRAIN - DAY                                                  134 
Kell and Emma on the train, watching buildings slide by outside the window. Kell troubled, holding her daughter... 
135   EXT. AERIAL SHOT OF TRAIN - DAY                                   135 
WE FOLLOW the train traveling a path through canyons of buildings, leaving the city... 
ANGLE SWAPS TRAIN FOR CAR as we drift over a bridge and find Nick's car racing across the span...                                * 
136   INT. CANTRELL'S HOUSE - DAY                                       136 
Nick and Garza enter. ANGLE COMES AROUND to reveal the house swarming with HIGH-TECH FBI FORENSIC TEAMS turning the house upside-down, tearing things apart, X-RAY SCANNING walls... 
Cantrell sits isolated, near tears of frustration, as the place is trashed around him. He glances up, hearing: 
NICK Jesus.                                                 * 
CANTRELL Nick? These guys won't even let me pack a bag. Not even a toothbrush. 
Davies enters frame, accompanied by FORENSIC TECHS -- not the guys from downtown, but people who work serious ops. 
DAVIES We have granules of an unidentified substance in the ice-maker... 
He holds up a drinking glass with a few ice cubes, runs a black-light wand behind it -- dark granules become visible on each pass, embedded in the ice. 
DAVIES I'm betting something lethal. 
TECH #1 Like this salt. (pours a small amount) Not sodium chloride. Potassium chloride. It's a neuro-blocker, stops the heart -- they use it in lethal injections. You'd be dead before you got up from the table.                      * 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                 87. 
Nick tosses the others a grim look.                      * 
NICK I'm telling you, Clyde has someone          * working with him. Someone on the outside. 
CANTRELL Who? Who could he have? 
NICK Somebody from his past. Could be            * that spook we met on the stairs,            * for all we know -- he'd know how to         * plant this shit...

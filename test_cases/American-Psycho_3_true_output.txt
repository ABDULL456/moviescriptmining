He pours her a shot of vodka and makes her drink it. 
BATEMAN (Chatting as if they were at a cocktail party) So, you're looking great, how have you been? 
CHRISTIE (A little confused) Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time. 
BATEMAN (Mock shock) Really? 
CHRISTIE My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer. 
BATEMAN Oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. Here. 
He writes her a check for $I ,000 to cash and hands it to her. She snatches the check out of his hand and gets quickly out of the limo, walking hurriedly down the street. 
BATEMAN Bitch. 
He follows alongside her slowly in the limo, waving a huge wad of cash at her. She hesitates; he uses the money to lure her into the car. As she reluctantly gets into the limo, she reaches for the money. 
He snatches it away. 
BATEMAN Uh uh uh. Half now, half later. 
She takes the money and puts it inside her shirt. 
BATEMAN Okay, your name is Christie. We're meeting a friend of mine, Elizabeth. She'll be joining us in my new apartment shortly. You'll like her. She's a very nice girl. Don't say anything about yourself. Is that clear. Christie? 
Christie nods. 
INT. PAUL OWEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
The living room: ELIZABETH has kicked off her shoes and flopped down on the couch underneath the Baselitz. Elizabeth is an attractive, dark-haired society girl who models occasionally. Christie is sitting on the couch opposite her, pretending to examine a CD. 
ELIZABETH You look really familiar. Did you you go to Dalton? 
Christie shakes her head. 
The kitchen: Bateman is grinding up tabs of Ecstasy and putting them in a bottle of wine. In the living room, Elizabeth is still staring at Christie as if she came from Mars. 
ELIZABETH I think I met you at Au Bar, didn't I ? With Spicey? 
Christie looks blank. 
ELIZABETH Well, maybe not with Spicey but it was definitely at Au Bar. 
Christie still blank. 
ELIZABETH You know, Au Bar? 
Christie shakes her head. 
ELIZABETH Anyway, Au Bar sucks now, it's terrible. I went to a birth day party there for Malcolm Forbes. Oh my God, please. 
Bateman enters carrying the bottle of wine and two glasses. Christie, who seems frightened, sips her wine and stares at the floor. There is an awkward silence. 
CHRISTIE This is nicer than your other apartment. 
BATEMAN (Offended that she prefers Owen's apartment) It's not that nice. 
Silence. 
CHRISTIE Where did you two meet? 
ELIZABETH Oh God! I met him at, oh God, the Kentucky Derby in '86-no, '87, and... (Turning to Patrick) You were hanging out with that bimbo Allison Poole. (Sarcastically) Hot number. 
BATEMAN What do you mean, she was a hot number. 
ELIZABETH If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob. (To Christie) Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need I say more?...What do you do? 
A long silence. Christie reddens and stares at the floor. 
BATEMAN She's my...cousin. 
ELIZABETH (Skeptically) Uh huh?

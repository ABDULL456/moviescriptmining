NYAH No.  Should I? 
ETHAN No.  You just looked as if you did. 
NYAH No.  Just as if I'd like to. 
ETHAN Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged. 
NYAH Not tonight.  Bad timing.  Sorry - 
ETHAN There's not enough time in the world for any of it to be bad. 
This stops her.  Nyah moves closer to him, until they're nose to nose.  Whispered but breezy: 
NYAH Look, it's either you or the rent and I don't mind telling you it's not an easy choice. 
ETHAN What if I pay the rent? 
NYAH Uh-huh. 
ETHAN Uh-huh? 
Glancing at the gentleman making his way back with her drink then: 
NYAH Go find the wealthy lady you came with and next time we meet - I'll pay your rent. (kissing him, sweetly) Now bugger off. 
And purposeful creature that she is, she takes her frustrated desire upstairs, timing her footsteps so as to use the sound of the dancer's steps to cover her own.  Once upstairs, a security guard near the master bedroom can be seen eagerly following her down the hall, both moving past a pair of windows, visible to Ethan.  In a few moments, Nyah can be seen past the windows in the opposite direction, without the guard following. In another moment or two, a very puzzled looking security guard can be glimpsed in the first window, looking up and down the hall, clearly having lost sight of Nyah.  Ethan smiles, moves out of shot. 
INT - MASTER BEDROOM (EVE) 
Nyah has opened the door and moves swiftly thru the bedroom. 
INT - BATH (EVE) 
A decadent looking affair with suggestive lighting, mirrored walls.  The tub has a tray across it which includes a wine cooler chilling a bottle of Crystal and a mound of caviar on a bed of ice.  Nyah can't resist.  She spoons a dollop of the caviar and downs it before she moves along the frescoed walls of the tub to its back.  There, she pulls out her compact and removes the puff, revealing an electronic density meter.  She turns it on and holds it at the rear of the tub.  Its sweep gauge jumps sharply from green thru yellow and into red. 
NYAH (her fondest hopes confirmed) Mmmm. 
She now steps into the tub and focuses on the grout between the tiles just above the sop dish.  Her knee eyes search for any cracks in the grout and she spots one.  Using a tweezers she pulls the silver of the grout out from between the tiles, revealing something that looks like a credit card wedged between the tiles. She slips the card into a narrow opening under the sop dish. 
There's the sound of hydraulics and two arms move the marble casing out from the rear of the tub.  Nyah breathes a sigh of relief and anticipation: kneeling in the tub she finds herself looking down at an open safe, revealing some half-dozen locked compartments.  As she studies them: 
ETHAN Decisions, decisions. 
Nyah looks up to see Ethan's reflection in the bathroom mirrors, looking down at her kneeling in the tub. 
NYAH What are you doing here? 
ETHAN Think you're the only one who can pick a lock? 
NYAH (not altogether pleased) I see.  You're not just another pretty face.. 
Before Ethan can answer, a voice can be heard coming from the bedroom warbling Granada in Spanish, and with considerable gusto. 
NYAH (cont'd) Oh god.  A bloody baritone. 
Nyah catches a reflection behind Ethan's in the bathroom mirror. She reaches up and grabs Ethan by the lapel, yanking him into the tub, pulling him down on top of her.  Once again they're nose to nose. 
ETHAN I take it you prefer tenors. 
She glances up at the mirror.  In it is the reflection of SENOR AUGUSTO DE L'ARENA, a big amiable Castilian in his fifties who's changing a white dinner jacket that's had wine split on it.  He breaks into a heavily accented version of 'Now or Never', and disappears from the dressing room mirror. 
NYAH Would you mind if I'm on top? 
ETHAN Oh, either way works for me. 
With a jaundiced look she rolls over on top of Ethan and begins working on one of the safe compartments, using a tiny torque wrench from a tube of lipstick and a carbide pick from a mascara brush.  She glances down and is rather disconcerted.  Continues working with the pick and wrench. 
ETHAN'S VOICE You're never gonna find it there. 
NYAH (she jumps, dropping the torque wrench) Damn it!  Find what? 
ETHAN His ex-wife's Bulgari necklace that goes up for auction Tuesday. 
Looking down to Ethan, a touch of indignation: 
LOOKING UP 
more or less, hands locked behind his neck as he rests against the raked back of the tub, his eyes and nose inches from Nyah's lower pelvic region as she straddles him.  Not exactly in the mood to move:

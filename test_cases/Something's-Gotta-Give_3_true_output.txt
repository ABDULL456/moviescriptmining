HARRY 
(kisses her quickly, even faster throws out) I love ya. 
ERICA 
I love you too...if that's what you said. I don't know if it ends in 'ya' if it's an official I love you but... Harry expression looks something like he's in pain. Then. . . 
HARRY 
You're not like anybody. 
ERICA 
Neither are you. 
INT. CAR - MOVING AWAY FROM THE HOUSE - DAY 
Lowell drives, rattling on about all the people who have been calling about him. Harry, in the backseat, looks back at the house, until it is finally out of view. Harry then looks inside the bag with the sandwich and finds an Envelope from Erica, pulls it out, doesn't open it, places it back in the bag then takes out his cell phone and dials. 
INT. ERICA'S LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME - OVER, THE PHONE RINGS 
The room is empty. Erica rushes in, picks up the phone.

on her cell phone, CRYING. 
MARIN 
Who? It's me. 
INTERCUT 
ERICA 
What's wrong? 
MARIN 
I had breakfast with Dad this morning and we're talking and he starts looking all weir~ and then he tells me he met someone three weeks ago and it's "really something and then he (sobbing now) He tells me he's getting married. Why am I reacting this way? I'm almost thirty years old... (people stare at her) Yes, I'm crying, leave me alone. 
ERICA 
Who's he marrying? 
MARIN 
I don't know. Some chick he met three weeks ago. She's four years older than me and she's an Ear, Nose and Throat Doctor. Has he lost his mind? I have a huge auction tonight... Why do I have to be the one to deal with this? Can you please come in? I'm rea:~y upset, my shrink'~ away for two weeks...I know you're working but. . .please. . ? 
AN UPPER EAST SIDE STREET - A LITTLE LATER 
One of those gorgeous tree lined streets from a Woody Allen movie that makes New York seem quaint. Harry's Town Car pulls up in front of a GORGEOUS   PRISTINE TOWNHOUSE. Harry steps out in shades, holding an   unlit cigar. Lowell joins him as the Front Door opens and out   pours his Two Leggy Assistants and thumping Hip Hop   Music. LOWELL Good to be back? HARRY Let's find out. 
EXT. ERICA'S HOUSE - LATER 
Camera quickly TRACKS Erica down the front path and to her car. She's on her cell. 
ERICA 
Hold on, I'm losing you. Okay,    so you'll let Harry know I'll be. in the    city tonight and he can reach me on    my cell...if he wants... Okay? Aw    shit. Hello? 
EXT. SOTHEBY'S AUCTION HOUSE - THAT NIGHT 
A Crowd files in for tonight's auction. 
INT. BACKSTAGE DRESSING ROOM - SAME TIME 
A tearful Marin is changing from jeans and a T-shirt to a proper dress and heels. Erica leans on a table, listening. 
MARIN 
-- Look, I get that he has a right to get remarried, but he doesn't even know her and she's like my age. You know what that's like? It's like beyond creepy. And I know he's not replacing me so why does it feel like he is? This is crazy, right? Crying like this... 
lights a cigarette) 
ERICA 
Honey, if he's replacing anyone, it's me. And all the statistics say divorced men almost always remarry. That's just the way they're built. 
MARIN 
(slipping on her dress) Mom, you want to know the answer to the big mystery of my life? Why I'm always with the wrong guy? This is why. Because the wrong guy can't do this to you. You have some control with the wrong guy. This thing I'm feeling right now. This is my big fear...that some guy could get me unglued like this, like nothing's connected. And this is just my father! I'm just not strong enough to handle this kind of drama. 
ERICA 
The drama in life is what makes you strong. 
MARIN 
No, it's what makes you strong. You've never really understood this,but we're not all like you. 
MARIN (CONT'D) 
I'm sorry, if I were you and my ex husband, the man who I still allow to direct my plays.! was getting married to some 33 year old Ear, Nose and Throat Babe, I'd be bonkers. And look at you. (realizes) You've never looked better, by the way. (sinks) My anti-depressant is obviously not working. It should cover events like this shouldn't it? 
ERICA 
Since when do you take an antidepressant? 
MARIN 
Ugggh, mother, do you know anyone who doesn't? 
ERICA 
Yes. Me. 
MARIN 
I rest my case. A KNOCK on the door. 
VOICE FROM OUTSIDE 
Marin, we're all set. 
MARIN 
Mom, can you do one other really big thing for me? Just say yes. 
ERICA 
(taking two Turns) Anything bubee. 
MARIN 
Will you come out to dinner tonight with me and Dad and the fiance? 
ERICA

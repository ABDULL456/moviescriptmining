ANNA No, he's not leaving his wife for me. He's just - he's a good guy. And he can't really explore what we could be if he's lying to her. 
Mary looks at her. 
ANNA (CONT'D) He's kind of leaving his wife for me. Is this crazy? This is totally crazy. We barely know each other. 
MARY I don't know.   Remember Becca, my sister's friend. Some guy waits on her at Bennigan's - by the end of the night they both knew they had found the one. 
ANNA You're totally right.   It can happen. 
MARY Not for me. 
ANNA Well, what about texter? 
MARY Texter has yet to make any verbal contact. I mean, this guy could have had surgery that left him without a voice box, breathing through a stoma, and I'd never know because I never actually hear his voice. 
ANNA I doubt he has a stoma - 
MARY That's not the point. The point is - I can't text. I'm not charming via text. My sarcasm doesn't come through, I can't type fast enough on the little phone keyboard -- 
ANNA So don't text. 
MARY It's not just texting. It's email and voicemail and snail mail - 
ANNA That's just mail - 
MARY Whatever. None of it's working. I've had a guy leave a voicemail for me at work, and then I call him back at home, and he emails me to my Blackberry, and then I text him to his cell and then he emails me to my home account from the plane phone -- and it just totally gets out of hand. I miss the days where you had one phone number with one answering machine that housed one cassette tape and either the cassette tape had a message from the guy or it didn't. That's it. Now you have to go around checking all your portals and get rejected by seven different technologies. It's exhausting. 
Anna, who is trying a different shade of nail polish on each finger, calmly looks up at Mary. 
ANNA So what about the singer guy? 
MARY Jude.    Yeah, I like him. 
ANNA That's great. 
MARY Totally.     I felt like we connected. 
INT. GIGI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Gigi sits on the couch, wrapped in a blanket, eating graham crackers and watching SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL on TV. The phone RINGS. 
GIGI Hello. 
INTERCUT WITH: INT. RED MAPLE - OFFICE - NIGHT 
Even in the office we can hear the din of the bar scene. 
ALEX Oh, hey.     You're home. 
GIGI Where am I supposed to be? 
ALEX Out.    It's Saturday night. 
GIGI You won't let me go out with guys who don't like me. It's kind of limiting. 
ALEX I was just calling to let you know - I'm having a party at my place next weekend. You should come. 
Gigi considers this. 
GIGI I don't know. Won't Conor be there? Might be kinda awkward. 
ALEX He's in DC for the weekend at some real estate conference. But there's gonna be a bunch of single guys. 
GIGI So I will have plenty of chances to be awkward. Thank god. 
ALEX Don't worry. I'll be there.      I'll talk you through it. 
Gigi smiles. 
GIGI So, the party - is it like a big party, more of a mellow hang or -- 
A CRASH outside Alex's office. 
ALEX Yeah, OK. Gotta go - I think someone just dropped 84 wine glasses. 
Gigi hangs up, and goes back to watching her movie. 
CLOSE ON: The TV screen as Mary Stuart Masterson (as WATTS) and Eric Stoltz (as KEITH) hang out in a garage. 
WATTS Amanda Jones is no minor leaguer who'll be swept off her feet at the touch of your amateur lips. 
KEITH I think I can handle it. 
WATTS It's cool. I was just gonna work on it with you but - if you're comfortable...great. 
KEITH Wait.   How do you work on it? 
WATTS Pretend I'm a girl, OK?    I mean, pretend I'm her...Amanda. 
Gigi sits up. A light bulb has gone off. As she watches Keith and Watts kiss on screen, a smile crosses her face.

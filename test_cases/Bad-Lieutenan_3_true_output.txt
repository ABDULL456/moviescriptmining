LITE How's the case going? 
LT What case? 
LITE The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember? 
LT Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet. 
LITE That 50 G could help you -- 
LT looks as LITE as if he's crazy. He shakes his head. Sing- songs at him as if trying to teach an impaired student. 
LT The Mets are gonna win the Series. They're a lock. 
A change comes over LT. He leans in, gets seriously excited. LT is possessed by his memory of this afternoon's game. 
LT Get this, man. I was at the game today. Face to fucking face with Strawberry! Jesus! I saw him strikeout. And you know what? He looked at me, and I looked at him, and he laughed and I laughed and it was like we were all alone in that whole stadium and only we understood that it was all a racket, that he struck out on purpose, and that he's saving it up for the Big One. Tomorrow. Today I understood for the very first time that -- 
LITE You've really got a problem. 
LT shakes his head. Repeats himself in that sing-song, didactic way. 
LT -- that there was never any other way it could have gone. (beat) Never any other way. So you had better just put in my fucking bet. $120,000 on the last game. The Big One. Come on! Are you a bookmaker, or fucking what? 
LITE Here. Look I'll give you the psyho's number You call him yourself and tell him wnat you want. 
LITE stands up. He writes the BOOKIE'S NUMBER on a MATCHBOOK and gives it to LT. 
LITE leans over and gives LT a final warning. 
LITE You couldn't pay 60. You lose, you'll be in for 180. To a guy who kills people for nothing. 
LT LAUGHS. He's already onto the next thing. He checks out the GIRLS at the other TABLES. 
LITE takes to go. Then decides to try once more to get LT's attention. 
LITE I was supposed to meet him at midnight with the 60. It's already 1:00 AM. Be careful. I mean it. 
LT is still laughing as LITE leaves the V.I.P ROOM. 
Before going out the door, LITE turns to look one more time at his friend. 
POV LITE - LT is engaged in a clumsy come-on. Oblivious. The last thing LITE sees is LT grabbing a COCKTAIL WAITRESS' LEG and falling out of his chair. LT LAUGHS all the way to the FLOOR. 
LITE lowers his head and exits.

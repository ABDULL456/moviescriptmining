TALLEY Yes. 
WALTER Then you have everything.  You can put them away. 
TALLEY (touches his wrist) A man has my family.  Gold watch here. Dark tan. 
WALTER That would be Glen Howell.  He was on his way for the disks. 
TALLEY How do I reach him? 
EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT -- NIGHT 
Talley is alone in his car, his phone to his ear, listening to the ring at the other end of the line.  A familiar voice answers -- 
HOWELL'S VOICE Hello? 
TALLEY Two words:  Glen Howell. 
Intercut Howell in his motel room.  He is thrown by getting this call -- 
HOWELL How did you get this number? 
TALLEY Mr. Jones is dead.  So are two of his men.  The other three are in jail.  I have the disks.  I have Walter Smith. And you know what, you motherfucker?  I have you. 
HOWELL I have your fucking family.  Don't forget that. 
TALLEY I also have a couple of million in cash. Call Sonny Benza.  Ask if I can keep it. 
This throws Howell, too.  He didn't expect anything like this; not from Talley -- 
HOWELL What do you want? 
TALLEY My wife and my daughter and the money. I'll bring the disks to the mall by the freeway, you bring my family.  We'll trade. 
HOWELL Fuck that!  You think I'm crazy?! 
TALLEY I think you got no choice. 
Howell thinks about it.  It's a tough call because Talley might be setting him up, but they're playing even hands-- Talley still has the disks -- 
HOWELL Fuck the mall.  You know that motel on the road west of town? 
TALLEY Yeah. 
HOWELL You got ten minutes.  If you're one minute late, we won't be here to find. 
Talley tosses his phone aside, then drives away -- 
EXT. NEW YORK CITY -- NIGHT 
A graphic identifies our location:  New York City. 
INT. VICTOR CASTELLANO'S BROWNSTONE -- NIGHT 
Victor Castellano is "the old man" that Benza's people have mentioned.  He is not a happy man in the best of circumstances and is even less happy now -- 
Castellano's assistant, Jamie Beldone, is briefing him on events in the West -- 
BELDONE The house is in flames, Benza's accountant is with the cops, and they're stacking the bodies like cordwood. 
CASTELLANO Jesus Christ, it's a clusterfuck. 
BELDONE You wanted to let Sonny handle it.  I would've moved in when we first found out. 
Castellano scowls at the younger man -- 
CASTELLANO And by doing so, he would've known we have spies in his organization. 
BELDONE (embarrassed) Yes, sir.  But what about the disks?  If the cops end up with the disks, we're gonna see a whole lot of heat. 
CASTELLANO I hate that Mickey Mouse bastard.  I hated his father, and I hate Sonny, too. Always with the tan. 
BELDONE What do you want to do? 
CASTELLANO Our people out there, they good people? People in the right place? 
BELDONE The best. 
CASTELLANO Sonny's a fuckup.  If he pulls this off, fine--life goes on.  But if the cops end up with those disks, we cut our losses. 
BELDONE I understand. 
CASTELLANO I want a message sent:  No fuckups allowed. 
BELDONE I'll make the call. 
Vic Castellano watches Beldone depart as he considers what is about to come -- 
EXT. MOTEL -- NIGHT 
The motel floats like an island of light in the middle of nowhere.  A few cars are scattered throughout the quiet parking lot --

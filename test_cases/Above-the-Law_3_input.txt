leaps off the roof! 
312   ANGLE - ELEVATED TRAIN - MOVING Nico lands on the roof of the speeding "el" train, his momentum nearly carrying him off the far side -- 
313   NICO - ATOP TRAIN catches a railing, claws at it.   BULLETS rip into the train roof all around him -- 
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                          84. 
314    ATOP TENEMENT ROOF - SALVANO AND ZAGON FIRE for all they're worth at Nico's receding form. 
315    ATOP TRAIN - NICO crawls to the space between cars, lowers himself down.      He clings to the swaying chains. 
315A   INT. TRAIN CAR Nico staggers through the almost empty car and collapses on a bench. 
316    AROUND CORNER - TWO POLICE CARS hurtle INTO VIEW under the El, SIRENS BLARING.                   * 
317    BACK ON TENEMENT ROOF Zagon and Salvano scramble away. 318    OMITTED CUT TO: 
319    EXT. EL STATION - STAIRWAY TO STREET - NIGHT A cleaner, more upscale neighborhood. Nico labors down the steps, clutching his jacket to his ribs. Several affluent people look at him oddly, he ignores them, keeps going -- He makes his way up the street, weakening, to a tasteful brown- stone. Nico climbs the steps in pain -- QUICK DISSOLVE TO: 
320    INT. JACKSON'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT Nico over the sink, shirt off, WATER RUNNING -- applying a makeshift bandage to his bloody ribs. We see Jackson's make- up stuff along the counter, feminine robes hanging on the door, law books around a reading stand. Nico is in real pain, exhausted, weakening -- 
321    LIVING ROOM - NIGHT Nico at Jackson's desk, its surface spread with the notes and papers she got from Senator Harrison's aide's place. We glimpse them: photos of Central American atrocities, dead bodies, etc. He tries to study them, quickly, but his attention shifts -- 
Nico glances around the apartment: more law books, Jackson's degree on the wall, her rowing machine on the floor, several framed photos beside him on her desk. Nico turns several toward him. 
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                          85. 
322    INSERT - FRAMED PHOTOS Jackson with her sisters and their kids, Jackson in law class, Jackson and Nico posing, smiling, at the police shoot- ing range -- 323    BACK TO NICO 
He starts to cry. 
NICO (to Jackson's photo) -- Had to be a hero... another fucking hero. I'm sorry Jax. He reaches for a small calendar, looks at it. 
324    CLOSEUP - CALENDAR 
Nico circles "meet with Father Tomassino." Nico circles another date, "Senator delivers foreign policy position paper/Committee for Democratic Policy fund raiser."             * 325    OMITTED 327    BACK TO NICO Nico scoops up the aide's papers, stands, wobbly -- 
NICO -- Senator... -- (of papers, with scorn) -- dumb fuck... think they're gonna let you put 'em outta business -- 327A   INT. EMERGENCY ROOM CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
Several cops frantically clear the way to the emergency room. A gurney is wheeled down the corridor. Lukich, a shoulder bandaged, walks beside the gurney, holding the hand of Jackson. 
327B   CLOSEUP ON a bloody flak jacket rests upon the gurney. 
327C   CLOSEUP - JACKSON 
She's been sedated. She has buckshot wounds on her neck and shoulder, but she is alive. 
JACKSON (to Lukich) You call Nico's goddamn Uncle and find out if he's heard anything.

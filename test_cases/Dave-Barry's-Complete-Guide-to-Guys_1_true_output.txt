EXT. THE PROW OF A SHIP - DAY 
Shrouded in fog. EXPLORER ROGER scans the horizon through a spyglass. Next to him is long-suffering EXPLORER ELAINE. 
EXPLORER ELAINE Well did you ask? 
EXPLORER ROGER This is a shortcut. Explorer Elaine shakes her head. Dave enters. 
DAVE There's a very simple reason why guys don't ask for directions. It's because they know that if they do, someone else - most likely Visigoths - will come and steal their woman. CAMERA PANS to the side rails, where a CLUSTER OF HUNGRY VISIGOTHS nod, slobbering, confirming this. 
EXPLORER ELAINE I just want to get to Colonial America.

EXT. BOSTON HARBOR - NIGHT 
A bunch of GUYS dressed as Indians are throwing barrels into the water. A COLONIAL REPORTER interviews COLONIAL ROGER. 
COLONIAL REPORTER -- and this is your way of expressing the public outrage over the high- handed anti-democratic actions of the British Government in general and King George III in specific?

COLONIAL ROGER 
(POINTS) Guy over there. 
COLONIAL REPORTER The one drinking coffee? 
COLONIAL ROGER That's him. His name's Starbuck. He said to get rid of all the tea. 
COLONIAL REPORTER 
(NODS; THEN) I see. One more question. Aren't those Greek fraternity letters painted on your chest? The Guy looks; GREEK LETTERS in greasepaint. 
COLONIAL ROGER I didn't do that. (then as the Reporter 
WAITS) Don't tell anyone.

EXT. MIAMI - OUTDOOR CAFE - DAY 
FOUR MIAMI GIRLS, ethnically cross-sectioned. LILA. MIA. 
SIDRA. KARLA E. 
LILA Well that's pretty much how it is right now, right? They don't grow up. Or, they grow up, but they don't change. 
MIA 
(NODS) You want to know how to spot a guy, there's your first clue: Look for an otherwise man who did not grow up.

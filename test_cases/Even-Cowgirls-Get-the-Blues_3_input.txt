CHINK During the Second World War I busted out of Tule Lake detention camp; as a Japanese-American, I had been put there and watched over. I found refuge with the Clock People, who discovered me in a snow bank, near dead, I had been climbing across the Sierra Nevada mountains. 
SISSY Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink? 
CHINK The Clock People mistook me for Chinese. And the name stuck. In the same way that all Indian tribes came to be labeled "Indians" through the ignorance of an Italian sailor with a taste for oranges, it is only fitting that "Indians" misnamed me. The Clock People, however, are not a tribe, rather they are a gathering of Indians from various tribes. They have lived together since 1906. 
INT. THE GREAT BURROW 
A gathering of the Clock People. A woman is giving birth near the Giant timekeeping hourglass. 
CHINK The pivotal function of the Clock People is the keeping and observing of the clockworks. It is a real thing, and is kept at the center, at the soul, of the Great Burrow. Insofar as it is possible, all Clock People deaths and births occur in the presence of the clockworks. Aside from birthing or dying, the reason for the daily visits to the clockworks is to check the time. 
INT. SIWASH CAVE NIGHT 
Sissy listens to the Chink as they walk around the Chink's clockworks. 
CHINK These people have no other ritual than this one. Likewise, they have but one legend or cultural myth: that of a continuum they call the Eternity of Joy. It is into the Eternity of Joy that they believe all men will pass once the clockworks is destroyed. The destruction must come from the outside, must come by natural means, must come at the will of this gesticulating planet whose more acute stirrings thoughtless people call "earthquakes." 
The Chink holds Sissy's thumbs in his hands adoringly. 
CHINK The Earth is alive. She burns inside with the heat of cosmic longing. She longs to be with her husband again. She moans. She turns softly in her sleep. In the Eternity of Joy, pluralized, deurbanized man, at ease with his gentle technologies, will smile and sigh when the Earth begins to shake. I loved those loony redskins, but I couldn't be a party to their utopian dreaming. After a while it occurred to me that the Clock People waiting for the Eternity of Joy was virtually identical to the Christians waiting for the Second Coming. Or the Communists waiting for the worldwide revolution. Or the Debbies waiting for the flying saucers. All the same. Just more suckers betting their share of the present on the future, banking every misery on a happy ending to history. Well, history is ending every second - happily for some of us, unhappily for others, happily one second, unhappily the next. History is always ending and always not ending... ha ha ho ho and hee hee. 
Sissy interrupts the Chink for a second while he is worshipping her thumbs. 
SISSY What do you believe in then? 
CHINK Ha ha ho ho and hee hee. 
Then he says nothing. And his silence makes Sissy weep. They sit down on a grass floor, illuminated by the fire outside the cave. 
Then the Chink, without hesitation, grasps her thumbs. He squeezes them, caresses them, covers them with wet kisses, telling them how beautiful they are. 
Sissy is bowled over, frightened, stunned, elated, moved almost to tears. 
Sissy bends her head back and whispers. 
SISSY If this be adultery, make the most of it. 
And as the Chink plunges into Sissy, she arches her spread bottom against the blankets and rears up to meet him halfway. 
Their bodies glowing in the firelight, they cast shadows of ANCIENT BEINGS, anthropomorphs making love through the night under the moon. 
INT. CAVE DAY 
SUNBEAMS awaken Sissy. When she looks around she sees an inscription has been freshly scrawled on the right wall. 
I BELIEVE IN EVERYTHING; NOTHING IS SACRED.

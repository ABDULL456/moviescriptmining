-- THE ATTIC PANEL above her is wide open. 
Caught between a rock and a hard place.   Yoko decides: 
She shakily stands on the shelf and reaches up to pull herself into the attic. 
INT. ATTIC - DAY Yoko's head appears. Then her shoulders.     She looks around, but can't see a thing in the darkness. 
She's about to pull herself all the way up -- 
-- when she hears the THROATY CROAKING SOUND. 
Coming from the darkness. 
Yoko stiffens, her breath catching in her throat. 
ANOTHER POV: we're at the far end of the attic, suddenly and rapidly RACING FORWARD TOWARDS YOKO... 
ON YOKO:   something brushes her face.   Long, black hair. 
There's a head, just inches from hers.    Almost nose-to-nose.

Yoko is paralyzed with fear, eyes wide.   A long beat. 
Then she reaches into her pocket, pulling out a LIGHTER. 
Yoko raises it and flicks the wheel -- 
-- we get a glimpse of a PALE FACE, surrounded by long black hair, eyes wide and mouth open, the THROATY SOUND suddenly increasing in pitch and volume -- 
-- as the face moves forward -- 
CUT TO BLACK. 
89   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT                                    89 
Karen slowly wakes up in bed.    As her eyes clear, she sees -- 
DOUG. He sits on the edge of the bed, slightly slumped, his back to her. 
He slowly turns -- and a relieved smile crosses his face.     He moves closer, and reaches out a hand. 
DOUG It's okay.     I've got you. 
Karen nods, lacing her fingers in his. But her eyes are glazed and unfocused -- she's exhausted. 
DOUG Your boss told me what happened. I'm sorry. 
She turns away, the memory bothering her.    Doug takes her hand, massaging her fingers, worried. 
DOUG I talked to your teachers. They said you can take as much time as you need. We could go to Kyoto for a weekend, see those temples you're always talking about. 
Karen tries to smile back, but her heart's not in it. 
KAREN Running away won't help.

DOUG There's nothing to run away from, Kat. No one blames you for what happened. 
Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04     51A. 
KAREN I'm not even sure what did happen. 
DOUG You went to help someone who was, quite simply, beyond help. 
KAREN No, that's not what I mean... 
She trails off, trying to remember.   Doug waits. 
KAREN That house. There was something... 
Doug sees her frustration, and tenderly brushes a hair from her face. 
DOUG Don't beat yourself up searching for a greater truth, Kat. An old woman passed away in her sleep. It's sad, but that's all it is -- 
KAREN Is that how they said she died? 
DOUG I'm sorry this happened to you. But maybe, in a way, it will help you later. Death is an unfortunate but integral part of your future career. There's no avoiding it. Maybe now you'll be more... ready for it. 
KAREN I don't think I'll ever be ready for something like that. 
She turns away. Doug wraps an arm around her.   Karen leans into him, and he strokes her hair.

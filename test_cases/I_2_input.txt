RICHIE You gotta a better idea? 
Glass breaks and CROWS STORM OUT OF A WINDOW behind them. Startled, they all lose their footing and fall, crashing down onto a pile of rope below. 
INT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 1ST FLOOR, KITCHEN 
Eddie looks to the shaking fridge. Blood oozes out of it and starts to cover the floor, inching towards him. Eddie backs away, horrified. 
EDDIE No. No no no. Will?     Help me! 
INT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 2ND FLOOR BEDROOM 
Will sees the blood, looks to Ben and Mike. 
WILL What do we do? 
BEN We can't leave him alone down there. 
Mike looks at the old moldy mattress. 
INT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 1ST FLOOR, KITCHEN 
Eddie hops onto a rocking chair as the whole floor is coated with BLOOD. 
EDDIE Hurry, guys! 
The fridge door starts to YAWN OPEN. Eddie curls in a ball and closes his eyes. 
EDDIE (CONT'D) This isn't happening. This isn't happening. 
Inside is Pennywise, all curled up. He unfurls himself like a coiled snake, holding a balloon on a string. It drags him, floating just above the bloody floor, across the room toward Eddie. 
PENNYWISE Open your eyes Eddie-bear. I brought you some cracker-jack. 
EDDIE Go away! 
PENNYWISE Away? But I just got here? And we're gonna have soooooo much fun, you and me. Now open those peepers. 
EDDIE No. 
PENNYWISE Kee-mon Eddie Bear. Don'cha wanna see the show? You're the main event. 
Eddie does. Pennywise is over him now, his teeth like razors, his clawed hands reaching out for Eddie's neck. 
PENNYWISE (CONT'D) You all taste soooooooo much better when you're afraid. 
Eddie screeeeeeeeeams! 
INT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 2ND FLOOR 
Mike lifts up the mattress and sees a decomposed corpse of some child underneath it. He screams, falling backwards towards Will and Ben. 
INT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, KITCHEN 
SUDDENLY ALL THREE OF THEM 
Fall onto Pennywise, smacking into the floor, blood splattering the walls, impact cushioned by Pennywise's body. They instantly fall to the side. 
Will, Mike and Ben look over to see what broke their fall- a just as startled Pennywise, writhing in anger. 
WILL Ah, fuck! 
Eddie scurries away from Pennywise, who bares his fangs at Will. 
CRASH! 
Just then the board from the window rips off to Richie, Stan and Beverly. 
She fires a bottle rocket at Pennywise's face, exploding right into his eye. The clown reels back howling. 
Richie and Ben jump in and grab Eddie. 
Pennywise pulls the rocket out of his burned socket and growls at the boys, morphing into an ORANGE GAS that shoots back into the fridge. 
Eddie, Ben and Richie climb to safety through the window, while Will watches from the window frame Pennywise's escape. 
EXT. EDDIE KASPBRAK'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
The kids BANG on Mrs. Kaspbrak's door. She opens it, sees his broken arm and freaks. 
EXT. EDDIE KASPBRAK'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 
Mrs. Kaspbrak is placing Eddie in the front seat of their family car. He is delirious with pain. 
MRS. KASPBRAK You! You all did this! 
She slams the door shut, hurting Eddie on the inside.   The kids are all too spooked to talk coherently. 
MRS. KASPBRAK (CONT'D) You know how delicate he is! 
RICHIE We were attacked, Mrs. K. Travis BOWERS AND-- 
MRS. KASPBRAK Stop it! Just stop it! If it weren't for you boys and that little tramp they'd have nothing against my Eddie-bear... Ohh, where are my keys? 
She's nearly in tears searching her purse. She dumps it out on the ground, prescription bottles, used kleenex's, food, deflated balloons. Gets on her knees and picks through it. 
MRS. KASPBRAK (CONT'D) Eddie's done with you kids, you hear? 
She gets up when she finds the car key, speaking with such vitriolic focus, she seems possessed. 
MRS. KASPBRAK (CONT'D) Don't come around here again, you don't deserve him. You're reckless, churlish little boys. (TO WILL) This is why your little brother died, William, because you are a LOSER, a reckless reckless reckless loser. God help me if I were one of your parents. 
She gets in the car and screeches away towards the hospital. They ALL watch the car disappear down the street.

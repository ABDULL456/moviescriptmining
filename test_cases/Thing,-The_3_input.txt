MACREADY Wait... 
The door begins to pound from the outside. Nauls and MacReady light two cocktails each. 
The door booms. The room's foundations shake. The ceiling quivers. The gas bombs are cocked. 
From the roof The Thing roars down into their midst. 
Stunned, the men stumble back. MacReady throws his gas bomb. Nauls the same. 
For a moment it stands silhouetted in flame. Enormous. 
Grotesque. 
Garry bolts for the main door. The Thing's tongue spirals from his mouth and spears him. The good two-thirds of its body follows its tongue and engulfs Garry by the door. 
Another leg slaps Nauls to the ground. MacReady dodges still another appendage, dives on the generators and throws the switch. 
The current rips through the door. Garry dies instantly. 
One of The Thing's talons, still caught in the door, sends it writhing in pain. It literally rips the door from its latchings and pounds it to the ground, trying to shake it loose. Nauls, hobbles, scrambles, out of the opening. 
MacReady dives through the window and out into the storm. 
CUT TO: 
INT. COMPOUND - HALL 
The distant sound of a motor. Nauls, battered and bloodied, his leg apparently broken, crawls along the ground. Another sound, a bubbling and gurgling is heard well to his rear. But closing. 
The terror forces him to drag faster, oblivious to the pain. 
He reaches the bathroom stall. Crawls in. Locks it. The gurgling nears. Leaning on the toilet seat, he looks about himself, frantically. 
The Presence pauses at the door. A scratching. Nauls paws, rips at a cracked and weathered slab of wood, cutting his fingers as he tries to break it off the siding. 
A strong blow begins to breach the stall door. Nauls finally unhinges the piece of wood, brings the jagged end to one side of his throat and rips... 
INT. LAB WALL 
The motorized rumbling nears. The wall seems to explode. The tractor barrels into the lab. Its enormous shovel scooper tearing half the room to shreds. 
MacReady drives. His eyes glint like a wild man's; he looks stark raving mad. 
His frostbite, now in an advanced stage, resembles black war paint. He clenches a stick of dynamite between his teeth, like a buccaneer's cutlass. Two large, compressed air tanks have been tied together at the top and are draped around his neck. They are marked -- HYDROGEN. 
They are used for the weather balloons. 
He pulls the tractor to a stop, yanks the stick from his mouth, grins and bellows. 
MACREADY Okay, creep! Just you and me now! Be on your toes! We're going to do a little remodeling! 
MacReady guns it through the next wall and into the infirmary. Medical equipment goes flying. The machine is powerful; the prefabricated walls buckling under its force. 
INT. COMPOUND 
A trail of viscous yellow ooze leads around a bend. 
Boom. 
MacReady rams into the mess hall, sweeping away tables, chairs. He sings out loud the lyrics of some Mexican song. All the while he keeps his eyes on everything. 
Through the kitchen. The foundation is crumbling. He sings on. 
NARROW PASSAGEWAY 
Gurgling and hissing. A taloned arm slinks around a corner in retreat. 
MACREADY (O.S.) Chime in if you know that words, old boy. 
MACREADY 
plows through several more rooms before ending up in the pub area. He backs it up and retrieves a bottle of liquor from the bar. 
MACREADY You like whiskey? Come on, join me for a drink. Be good for you. Grow fangs on your chest. 
He takes a drink and rams through another wall. 
INT. REC ROOM 
The tractor blazes into the rec room. MacReady parks it directly in front of the hole in the roof, created by The Thing when it surprised them earlier. 
MACREADY Damn it, ran out of gas. 
He pulls off the heavy hydrogen tanks and drapes them over the tractor. As he talks his eyes move like a hawk passing from roof, to doorways, to rubble. 
Wind and ice bristle through the gaping holes, stinging MacReady with the cold. He winces at his mittenless, blackened fingers. 
MACREADY Sweetheart, it's going to get mighty cold in here soon... You better make your move... I mean, hell, I'm only one person... 
He takes a swig from his bottle.

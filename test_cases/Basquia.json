{"test1_input": "RENE (hissing) You fucking little whore! You sold my painting! I'm gonna tell you something, brother - when you're climbing up the ladder of success, don't kick out the rungs! Believe that shit. \nBASQUIAT I'll make you another one. \nRENE Forget it. \nHe pulls out a scrap of paper and starts writing. \nBASQUIAT Rene - \nRene shushes him... He hisses loudly, like a cat. \nRENE SHHHHHH. Later. (speaking to himself) \"What is it about art, anyway......\" \nJean pauses. He turns around and surveys the room once more. \nA blink. \nSilence. \nWe see the crowd in SLOW MOTION. \nEveryone's eyes are shut. \nRENE (O.S.; CONT'D) ... that we give it so much importance? Artists are respected by the poor because what they do is an honest way to get out of the slum using one's sheer self as the medium. The money earned is proof pure and simple of the value of that individual... The Artist. \nINT. / EXT. GALLERY - NIGHT \nThe CAMERA rises higher and higher over the crowd and follows Jean as he makes his way toward the street. \nWe begin to DISSOLVE into a MONTAGE of stills of ARTISTS: \nRENE (O.S.CONT'D) The picture a mother's son does in jail hangs on her wall as proof that beauty is possible even in the most wretched. And this is a much different idea than the fancier notion that art is a scam and a rip-off. But you could never explain to someone who uses God's gift to enslave that you have used God's gift to be free.\" \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nJean enters a waiting limo. It pulls away from the curb. \nRene finishes as the limo threads its way through the night-lit, twinkling city. \nINT. LIMO - NIGHT \nThe DRIVER is the young Rasta we saw earlier outside Ballato's driving Bruno and Andy. \nJean slumps in the back seat. \nThe driver can't help staring in the rearview mirror. \nDRIVER I really... admire you. \nBASQUIAT Me? Why? \nDRIVER \nYou did it! You made it. I'm a painter, too. \nBASQUIAT That's great. \nDRIVER Would you check out my studio some time? \nBASQUIAT Sure. I'd be glad to. \nThe limo pulls over. \nDRIVER Here? \nQuickly, Jean gets out of the limo. He leaves the door open. \nThe DRIVER watches as Jean talks to two DRUG DEALERS. \nJean jumps back into the limo. \nThe driver pulls away. In the rearview mirror, he sees Jean separate a bag from a bundle of ten. He rips it open and snorts directly from it. \nHe lays his head back and takes a deep breath. \nBASQUIAT (calm, relieved) What's your name, man? \nDRIVER They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge. \nBASQUIAT Nice to meet you, Shenge. Want a job? \nINT. MR. CHOW'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT \n", "test1_true": "At the podium, the MAITRE'D approaches. \nMAITRE'D Good evening. \nFrom behind the Maitre'd on the mezzanine we see Bruno waving to Jean. \nIn the dining room on the lower level sit Annina and Rene. Nearby, at another, smaller table, are seated DAVID MCDERMOTT and PETER MCGOUGH, two artists dressed in Victorian attire. \nAnnina beckons him. \nRene looks away from him and talks to a WAITER. Jean waves to \nAnnina and continues towards Bruno's table. \nSeated at a large table are Andy, Bruno, Albert Milo, his wife and parents, Henry Geldzahler, MELINA PORTOS (a young heiress) and FRANCESCO and ALBA CLEMENTE and Mary Boone. Dinner's already served. \nAt the large table, everyone watches as Milo makes a portrait of Francesco in a beautiful leatherbound book. It belongs to Mr. Chow, who is nearby at the bar. \nANDY WARHOL Hi, Jean. \nHe motions to Mr. Chow to set a chair for Jean between Mary Boone and himself. \nBRUNO Jean, everyone loved your show. \nAs Jean is seated, Andy and Jack Milo resume conversation - \nJACK MILO Nixon lives in Saddle River, New York. \nANDY WARHOL Saddle River's in New Jersey. \nJACK MILO Saddle River, New York! \nANDY WARHOL It's in New Jersey. \nJACK MILO New York. \nANDY WARHOL I think it's in New Jersey. \nJACK MILO It's in New York. \nANDY WARHOL Oh, I didn't know that. \nCLOSE UP: Jean smiles at Andy's diplomacy. \nAlbert finishes drawing his portrait: it's Francesco with his arm around a headless torso. \nALBERT MILO (to Francesco) You finish it. \nHe pushes the book across the table. \nFrancesco begins to draw. \nMARY BOONE (to Jean) \nI hear your show was sold out already. There's a very important collector who's interested in some of your works. \nBASQUIAT Bring him over sometime. I have some other stuff to show him. \nAnnina watches from the other table as Jean talks to Mary. \nFrancesco finishes his drawing. \nAlbert takes the book and passes it to Jean. \nALBERT MILO (CONT'D) Go on, take it.. \nJean takes it. Mr. Chow watches his book change hands. \nJean takes a bowl of moo-shoo pork in front of him and dumps it onto the book. Then he uses a piece of pork to draw a head. \nSuddenly, there's a shrill, familiar voice. \nRENE I'd like a glass of your best champagne, please? (reading) This is an enormously important season in New York, and to make a false step could have severe repercussions for years. We are no longer collecting art, we're buying individuals. \nANDY WARHOL Oh shut up, Rene. \nRENE Everything's over your head, Andy. Even Mr. Chow's menu. (beat - to Jean) Thanks for not inviting me \nHe leans over everyone and helps himself to some spears of asparagus. \nANGLE ON \n", "test1_id": 1707, "test2_input": "BASQUIAT Should there be? \nINTERVIEWER Tell me about it. What are you angry about? \nJean drifts off. \nBASQUIAT Mmmm. I don't know. I don't remember. \nINT. FANCY GOURMET DELI - DAY \nJean and Andy browse through the aisles. Jean piles things into his cart. \nJean approaches the specialty counter. Andy continues with the cart. \nBASQUIAT (to COUNTERMAN) Can I have some caviar, please? \nThe Counterman selects a miniscule plastic spoon of caviar and begins to put it into a tiny glass jar. \nBASQUIAT (CONT'D) I'd like to taste it, first. \nReluctantly the Counterman gives him a taste with a look like \"what's a person who looks like you doing buying caviar?\" \nJean tastes the caviar and hands him back the spoon. \nBASQUIAT (CONT'D) Is that the best quality you have? \nCOUNTERMAN Yeah, it's the best one. \nBASQUIAT I'll take the whole tin. \nCOUNTERMAN It's three thousand dollars! \nBASQUIAT I'll take it. (wipes nose with sleeve.) Andy, gimme three thousand dollars. (beat) Just the caviar - I'll get the rest. \nHe hands two one hundred dollar bills for the other items to the counterman, who checks them carefully. \nBASQUIAT (CONT'D) You check everyone's bills or just mine? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. WINDOW - DAY \nA cheap pharmacy gift shop window. Jean and Andy look in on two yellow furry stuffed ducks which are part of a larger display. \nANDY WARHOL When I was little, my brother and I used to have two ducks as pets. We called them the Rodriguez Brothers. \nThey walk into a beauty salon. \nINT. BEAUTY SALON - DAY \nJean and Andy recline on the beautician's armchairs. THREE BEAUTICIANS busy themselves with the two of them, simultaneously giving them pedicures and manicures. Jean sets down a magazine. \nBASQUIAT I wish they'd quit writing this shit about me. \nANDY WARHOL That's good. At least they're interested. \nBASQUIAT Everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors - anything with a SAMO tag on it. (beat) The other day, I just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so I did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. A week later this gallery calls me up: \"Somebody's offering us the drawing. Should we buy it for five thousand?\" \nANDY WARHOL Wow... Stop giving them away. (beat) I got an invitation to model for Comme de Garcons... You wanna do it with me? \nBASQUIAT Yeah - I'd do that... You could teach me. \nANDY WARHOL Gee. I don't need to. You're a natural. You should sign up with my modeling agent. \nJean points to Andy's ankles - they have plastic flea collars on them. \nBASQUIAT Cool. \nANDY WARHOL My dog, Archie... I woke up with flea bites... Creepy. I ran out and bought flea collars. They work really well. \nBeat. \nBASQUIAT Let's leave this town and go someplace. \nSome island. \nANDY WARHOL Let's go to    the Carnegie Museum. They have the world's    most famous sculptures all in these giant    plaster replicas. It's really great. It's    in Pittsburg. \nEXT. STREET - - DAY \nThey walk out of the beauty salon.. \nJean sees the back of a girl. She looks a lot like Gina. \n", "test2_true": "ANDY WARHOL What's wrong? \nBASQUIAT That girl looks just like my old girlfriend Gina. \nANDY WARHOL Do you still love her? \nBASQUIAT Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her. \nANDY WARHOL Well, have you asked her to come back? \nJean shakes his head `no,' sorry that he didn't. \nINT. BARBETTA'S (RESTAURANT) - DAY \nA medium-sized dining room with dark wood paneling and tastefully appointed furnishings. \nJean and Gina enter. Gina looks considerably more conservative than previously - more like a student. Jean's dressed well, but looks even more careworn than usual. His hair is tied back with a necktie. He has a couple sores on his face. His skin looks a little puffy. \nThe MAITRE'D smiles at Jean and bows - \nMAITRE'D Mr. Basquiat - what a pleasure to see you again. \nBASQUIAT Hey George, what's up? \nA huge table with NINE WHITE EXECUTIVES. WAITERS clear their lunch settings. As they spot Jean and Gina entering, they gawk and snicker. \nGeorge leads them to their table. As they take their seats, Jean notices the suppressed giggles coming from the executives' table. They try to ignore it. George disappears. \nJean seems self-conscious about the sores on his face. \nGINA So are you really friends with Andy? He seems like such a weirdo. \nBASQUIAT He's not. He's out of town and he calls me every day. What's weird about him? \nGINA Don't you think he's using you? \nBASQUIAT Why does everybody say that? He's the only person I know who doesn't need to use me. \nGeorge reappears. \nGEORGE Would you like to see the wine list? \nBASQUIAT Chateau Latour '64, please. \nGeorge disappears again. \nGINA So. Are you ready? I start Columbia next fall. Of course, there's like, a year of pre-med stuff, but - whatever. I'm really excited. (beat) And: Rene gave me a job as his secretary. His poems are getting published. \nBASQUIAT How is he? \nGINA Pretty much the same. \nJean's eyebrows go up. \nBASQUIAT Wow. Congratulations. I hate that asshole. (beat) Thanks for coming. I guess I just wanted to find out how you're - \nGINA (referring to an extra loud snicker from execs) What's that about? \nBASQUIAT \nForget it. \nGeorge arrives and pours a sip for Jean to taste. He nods. George moves off. Two or three of the executives break out laughing. \nJean puts the glass down and looks at them. The other table is clearly making fun of him. \nGINA That is amazing. What year is it? \nBASQUIAT George? \nGeorge hurries over. \nGEORGE I'm sorry, Mr. Basquiat. \nBASQUIAT See that table over there? I'd like to pay their bill. \nLong silence. \nGEORGE I'm sorry? \nGina looks at Jean, confused. \n", "test2_id": 1708, "test3_input": "ANDY WARHOL That would be a pity because you're a real painter. \nFrank arrives. \nFRANK Here's the poster for the show. \nHe presents them with a yellow poster of Jean and Andy facing each other with boxing gloves. \nINT. FACTORY - NEXT DAY \nShenge hands Andy a box. \nAndy opens the box. Inside is a football helmet with Jean's dreadlocks glued to the outside. \nCLOSE UP: Andy in mirror wearing helmet. \nCUT TO: \nINSERT \nThe screen is filled with the cover of the New York Times Magazine. Jean is featured on the cover, without his dreadlocks. \nINT. GREAT JONES ST. LOFT - NIGHT \nAs Shenge opens the door, a CROWD of people spill out. They pour into the loft. The studio is crowded with PEOPLE. (Many of them we recognize from earlier scenes in Mudd Club, Jean's opening, etc). On the wall there is a portrait of Jean by Andy. The background is a piss painting. \nInside, Jean kneels on the floor in the corner of the loft with a bunch of people around him - girls, mostly. Twenty-five copies of the Times Magazine lay stacked on the floor. \nCrouching on one knee, Jean signs a copy for a BRUNETTE. \nLooking up - \nBASQUIAT Name? \nBRUNETTE Elke. \nBASQUIAT Number? \nBRUNETTE \nA BRUNETTE walks up - \nBASQUIAT Name? \nBLONDE Monica. \nBASQUIAT Number? \nBLONDE \nAndy's assistant, Frank, arrives with CHRISTINE, 25, a model. \nBASQUIAT Yo, Frank. \nFRANK This is really great. What a nice place. \nJean is taken with Christine. \nFRANK (CONT'D) Have you met Christine? \nBASQUIAT I don't think so. \nHe's thrown off his rhythm. \nCHRISTINE Would you sign one of those for me? \nTOXIC (seen with Rene at loft party earlier) spots Jean and steps in. \nTOXIC YO! Jean, this is Ramellzee. \nRAMMELLZEE Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you? \nTOXIC Uh-oh! \nRAMMELLZEE I'm here for an interrogation. You've been called a graffiti artist and I wanna know why. All I see are scribble scrabble abstractions! \nBASQUIAT Boom. \nRAMMELLZEE Boom? As in ordnance? Are your letters \narmed? What is the prime directive of graffiti culture? Do you know, black man? \nJean likes Rammellzee enough to be patient... Toxic grins and rolls his eyes to Jean. Jean watches Christine as they go on. \n", "test3_true": "RAMMELLZEE You're selling and ending the culture. Not one bit of information. Only to get the money and growl with the power, man. \nTOXIC That's ignorant. \nBASQUIAT That ain't ignorant - that's just stupid. (beat - to Christine) Can I get you a bowl of gumbo? \nRammellzee yells after him - \nRAMMELLZEE This interrogation is not over! \nJean escorts Christine to the kitchen. \nBruno and Andy stand in the crowd. \nNearby are two WOMEN. \nWOMAN Albert Milo? Ugh! He's just a pressmonger. That's all these people do. \nWOMAN #2 You know, I love Jean's early work. It's really got something. But this collaboration with Andy - maybe they thought it was a joke... I mean - whose work is it? Jean's or Andy's? \nWalking by, Rene responds to this - \nRENE His early work? He's only twenty-six! \nRene walks over to Jean. \nBASQUIAT Hey, Rene. \nRENE Thanks again for not inviting me. I'm only here on business. \nRene heads back out into the party. \nJean eats gumbo while Christine thumbs through the Times Magazine. \nANGLE ON \nRene responds to something Andy's been telling him in a low voice. \nRENE (CONT'D) (loudly) You're asking me? Nigga, please. After the way you treated me? This is the first time I've heard from either of you in months! I had to crash this party! You treated me like a suede biscuit. Rene don't play that! I can't get him off drugs! I don't even talk to him any more!!! \nANDY WARHOL (to Bruno) What's a suede biscuit? \nCUT TO: \nCHRISTINELooks up from her magazine.. \nCHRISTINE (amused) Hey, what's this? It says right here you're Andy's... \"lapdog\"... \nJean walks away. \nHe passes through the crowd, making his way to the door. \nHe exits. \nEXT. GREAT JONES ST LOFT - NIGHT \nDrugged, upset, Jean leaves the party. \nHe opens a limo door and looks back at his house. The party continues. \nThe limo drives off. \nWe HOLD on Jean's building. \nINT. LIMO - NIGHT \nThe limo floats through the streets. \nJean stares out the window. \nBASQUIAT Here...

{"train": "BLACK \nWe HEAR \"Waltzing Matilde,\" by Tom Waits. \nINT. MUSEUM OF MODERN ART - DAY (DREAM SEQUENCE IN GRAINY BLACK AND WHITE) \nFade out music. \nSilence. \nA well-dressed black BOY and his MOTHER walk through several galleries. \nThey stand before Picasso's \"Guernica,\" holding hands. \nThe mother is disturbed. Crying. \nThe boy looks up, confused and frightened, concerned to see his mother crying in public. She looks at him tenderly. \nHer brow furrows. She stops crying. She stares just above his eyes. \nSomething's happening: she looks with wonder at the top of his head... his eyes roll upward, trying to see - it's a crown! \nHe raises his hands. He touches it. \nA beam of light illuminates the crown, casting its glow on his mother's face. \nThe beam gets whiter, the rest of the screen gets black. \nINT. CARDBOARD BOX \nSilence. In darkness, we hear a VOICE - imbued with a sense of its own history: \nVOICE (O.S.) Everybody wants to get on the Van Gogh boat. There's no trip so horrible that someone won't take it. The idea of the unrecognized genius slaving away in a garret is a deliciously foolish one. We must credit the life of Vincent Van Gogh for really sending this myth into orbit. How many pictures did he sell? One? He couldn't give them away. We are so ashamed of his life that the rest of art history will be retribution for Van Gogh's neglect. No one wants to be part of a generation that ignores another Van Gogh. \nThe beam of light shines through a small hole. It falls upon a sleeping, dreaming, delighted face. It belongs to JEAN MICHEL BASQUIAT. \nOUTDOOR, DAYTIME SOUNDS filter in. \nHearing the voice, Jean frowns at being woken up. \nEXT. TOMPKINS SQUARE PARK - DAY \nA long, rectangular cardboard box. \nSUPER: \"NEW YORK CITY\" \nANGLE ON: \nRENE RICARD (early 30's), seated at a park bench, hunched over a notebook. He's a raggedy dandy: A poet in a hooded sweatshirt and white hightops. \nAs he writes, he reads aloud, as if addressing Posterity. \nRENE (CONT'D) (sighing theatrically) In this town one is at the mercy of the recognition factor. One's public appearance is absolute. \nBeyond him, a HAND gropes its way out of the box. It tosses a can of YOOHOO chocolate drink. \nRENE (CONT'D) I consider myself a metaphor of the public. I am a public eye. I am a witness. \nA HEAD appears from the box. It's Jean's. \nJean sees the start of a crisp, colorful autumn day. The urban park around him is alive with a typically full range of the good and bad in life. He eases himself out of the oversize box in which he has spent the night. There's something about the way that he stands while waking up that suggests he's almost surprised at his own body, the adultness of his limbs - just a subtle hint of him coming out of a dream. \nHe squints in the sunlight. He has a soft, gentle, Haitian face. His hair is pulled tight to his head. He wears two pairs of blue jeans (one cut like chaps over the other) a paint-covered Wesleyan University T-shirt, and the inside lining of an overcoat. His appearance is unruly, but it's deliberate. He's stylish. \nHe shakes himself off and collects his stuff, which includes: a small book of Pontormo drawings, a can of black spray paint. and a cigar box made into a loudspeaker with pencil holes and masking tape. \nJean walks out of the park and looks up past the buildings at the sky: \nSUPERIMPOSED IN THE SKY - STOCK FOOTAGE OF A HAWAIIAN SURFER \nJean sees the surfer, 'riding the nose' in glistening, shimmering \nsunlight. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. TOMPKINS SQUARE PARK - DAY \nRene grabs the box for use as a desk and continues to speak out loud as he writes. \nRENE (CONT'D, O.S.) Part of the artist's job is to get the work where I will see it. \nEXT. LOWER EAST SIDE ST. - DAY \nBASQUIAT Hey, mom. \nShe smiles slightly. \nJean takes a cookie. She does likewise. \nThey eat in silence, looking at each other, communicating what they can. \nTime passes. In between cookies her fingers find and break the stems of the pillow feathers. \nBASQUIAT (CONT'D) I met the girl I'm gonna marry. \nHis mother brightens. She drinks the milk. They finish the cookies. \nMATILDE Do you like it here? \nBASQUIAT I'd like it better in Hawaii. \nINT. CARDBOARD BOX - NIGHT \nJean tries to sleep in the box. RAIN falls heavily onto it. \nDrops of water hit his face. \nHe wills it to stop. It doesn't. \nFinally, he can't stand it. Rain forces his blinking eyes open. \nINT. BENNY'S APARTMENT -     NIGHT \nA door opens to reveal Jean's wet face. \nBenny lets him in. \nJean enters a rundown railroad flat crammed with musical instruments, beer cans, and homemade art. There's a couch with a sheet over it. \nJunk is piled in a corner - mostly art books and drawings. \nBenny sits down at an electric piano, which he's evidently playing. He sings along, softly, working out the words, concentrating, absorbed. \nJean sets his belongings on the couch, walks to a mic stand and starts making up his own words. \nBASQUIAT \"She loves me. Oh yeah she loves me! She loooooooves me, Oh yeah she loves me!\" Bring me some chicken, baby! \nBENNY Would you shut the fuck up? You hear what I'm doing? \nBASQUIAT Yeah man. I'm jealous. You're always great, Benny. (goes back into 'act') \"Her name is G-I-N-A Gina And she lo-oooves me.\" I did say chicken! \nBenny turns off the piano and lights a roach, angry at Jean's self-centeredness. \nJean digs through a pile of garbage. Finally, he finds what he's looking for - a pile of \"SAMO baseball cards\" - color Xeroxes of his favorite images and words. He pockets them. \nBASQUIAT (CONT'D) I knew I left these somewhere. One of these'll send your kids to college someday. (hands it to Benny solemnly) Here - I made this for you. \nBENNY Thanks. (beat) Your dad called again - something about a job. \nHe hands Jean a slip of paper. He notices the number on Jean's pants. \nBENNY (CONT'D) You got a date already? \nBASQUIAT (exhaling) We're getting married. She said she could tell I was a great artist - she could see it in my eyes. She said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me. \nBenny grins. He grabs a basketball and spins it expertly on his \nindex finger. \nBENNY G'night... See you in court tomorrow. \nJean turns on the TV. He notices the roach. He picks up the paper Benny gave him with the message from his father and sets it on fire. \nHe lights the roach with it. \nHe looks up; on television, we see a BUM being interviewed. Jean turns up the volume. \nThe bum's on the ground, looking beat up. Jean picks up a pocket recorder and turns it on: \nBUM The guy just hit me and I was on the ground!!!! Boom, for real. \nJean mutes the sound on the TV. He rewinds and proudly plays back the words \"Boom, for real.\" \nHe picks up the phone and dials. He turns on the speakerphone. \nJean holds the recorder to the speaker as someone answers the phone. (Jean walks in and out of frame throughout the following.) \nTHROUGH THE WINDOW \nHe sees Albert Milo    talking with ANDY WARHOL and BRUNO BISCHOFBERGER. Andy,    of course, is thin, silver-haired, and nearly albino. Bruno    is a Swiss art dealer in his 40's. He exudes money - a pillar of    security. \nOn the other side of the room, Rene Ricard is surrounded by a coterie of young, mostly BLACK AND HISPANIC MALES. Rene looks drunk, enjoying the moment, holding court. \nRene crosses to Albert and Andy. \nPeople pass by. \nJean starts to walk. \nAbout half a block away, he sprays on a wall: \n\"THE WHOLE LIVERY LINE BOW LIKE THIS WITH THE BIG MONEY ALL CRUSHED INTO THESE FEET\" \nHe looks pleased. He turns and looks up West Broadway beyond the buildings at the sky: \nSUPERIMPOSED IN THE SKY \nWe see a surfer emerging from a HUGE WAVE. He looks powerful and exalted. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BASKETBALL COURT - DAY \nANGLE ON: A wall. We see the following graffity: \n\"JIMMY BEST ON HIS BACK TO THE SUCKERPUNCH OF HIS CHILDHOOD YEARS\" \nA basketball bounces against a wall. \nJean and Benny amble onto a basketball court. Jean's changed his hairstyle. Now the dreadlocks stand straight up from his head. \nBenny dribbles with skill while Jean puffs furiously on a cigarette. He doesn't look like he's slept, but he's happy. \nBenny throws the ball to Jean. It bounces off a puddle and splashes Jean. \nBENNY Come on, Jean. Get rid of your cigarette. Concentrate. \nBASQUIAT I am... On Gina. (beat) Fuck - I didn't think we were actually gonna do this. \nBENNY Concentrate on the ball. Shoot. \nJean shoots. It flies up, up, up -     and over the backboard. \nHe runs after the ball, gets it, and dribbles clumsily. \nBENNY You're shattering all my myths. \nBASQUIAT About what? \nBENNY Your people. \nBASQUIAT Oh - you mean black people! \nHe shoots and misses again. He throws it to Benny, who does a picture-perfect lay-up. \nBASQUIAT (CONT'D) (changing the subject) How long do you think it takes to get really famous? \nDuring the following, Benny performs a series of amazing shots while Jean looks on admiringly. \nBENNY For a musician or a painter? \nJean shrugs. \nBASQUIAT Whatever. Famous. To where you can do your stuff all day without thinking about anything else. \nBENNY Ummm... Four years. Six to get rich. \nHe shoots. Swish. \nBENNY (CONT'D) First, you have to dress right. \nHe shoots again. Swish. \nBENNY (CONT'D) Then, you have to hang out all the time - with famous people - the right people, the right chicks, the right parties. \nHe shoots again. Swish. \nBENNY (CONT'D) And you gotta do your work all the time when you're not doing that. The same kinda work, the same style - over and over again, so people recognize it and don't get confused. Then, once you're famous, you have to keep doing it the same way, even after it's boring - unless you want people to really get mad at you - which they will anyway. \nBenny tosses Jean the ball. Jean walks off the court. \nANDY WARHOL I can give you five. You didn't do very much to these. \nBASQUIAT You don't even work on your stuff! \nBRUNO It doesn't matter how much you worked on \nthem. It matters how much you can get for them. \nBASQUIAT I can get ten. \nANDY WARHOL I'll take two. This one and... that one. (to Bruno) Can I borrow some money, Bruno? \nBruno pulls out a hundred dollar bill. \nBRUNO Here. Do you have change? \nAs WAITER arrives with the tray, Jean pockets the bill. \nBASQUIAT You made a good deal. Here, you can have these, too. \nHe leaves all the cards and walks toward the door. \nBRUNO'S POV: \nJean leaving past stupified Maitre'd. \nEXT. GINA'S APARTMENT - DAY \nJean and Benny are outside the entrance to Gina's building. Jean carries two huge bags overflowing with groceries and flowers. He buzzes. There's no answer. \nBASQUIAT I'll be right back. \nHe produces a key and lets himself in. \nHe enters the building. \nINT. GINA'S APARTMENT - DAY \nJean sets the groceries on the counter and leaves. \nWe notice the Bugspray painting on the wall, along with more of Jean's work and supplies. \nEXT. GINA'S APARTMENT - DUSK \nJean rejoins Benny in front of Gina's building. \nAs they're leaving, Gina comes up the street. \nBASQUIAT (to Benny) Check you later, man. \nBENNY Hi Gina. \nGINA Hi. \nINT - GINA'S APARTMENT - DAY \nFlowers and groceries are strewn on the counter. \nFADE TO BLACK \nFADE IN: \nOver the following MONTAGE we HEAR: \nRENE (O.S.) ... 'APT 20'... The church bells would ring at noon and six a.m.. 24 strokes: How many times we counted them. We called our bed the cloud. And there we'd float. The bathtub was in the kitchen and took forever to fill up. We'd bathe together afterwards. Oh the countless cigarettes and take out Chinese food... The bed was so narrow Three years we made it fit. The sheets were green the sheets were pink the sheets white linen from the past. Little home, farewell, The broken windows and the bodega on the corner. Now from my balcony I look out over all New York... \nINT. GINA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nJean and Gina are sleeping. \nSERIES OF DISSOLVES: As they're turning together in their sleep. \nFADE TO BLACK \nFADE UP: \nINT. KITCHEN / LIVINGROOM (GINA'S APARTMENT) - DAY \nFilled with Jean's paintings. \nSERIES OF DISSOLVES: Paintings and objects fill the room. \nFADE TO BLACK \nFADE TO WHITE \nINT. GINA'S APARTMENT - MORNING \nCAMERA PULLS BACK: Revealing Jean's eyes. They're open and motionless. His head is tilted toward his chest. \nOFF SCREEN WE HEAR the sounds of Gina coming home: \nThe LOCK turns. The door OPENS. \nGina comes in and drops a bag on the floor. \nGINA Basquiat? \nSilence. She picks up the mail from under the door and walks into the room. There's a lump on the floor. It's Jean. \nGINA (CONT'D) Wake up! I'm back! \nShe shakes his arm. No result. She lifts his head, revealing his painted hair. \nShe shakes him harder. His body is totally limp. \nThe whites of his eyes are red; his pupils slowly float up, vanishing. \nGINA Jean, what did you do to yourself? \nShe listens to his breath, then to his heart. \nGINA \n(panicking) Jesus Christ! \nShe finds heroin sprinkled into some pot on the floor near him. \nGINA (slapping his face) Don't do this to me. \nShe shakes him until his eyes unglue. His pupils float into their proper place. \nBASQUIAT ... What's the matter? \nGINA (furious) Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. How the fuck could you do that to yourself? \nBASQUIAT You're back. \nGINA It's Monday morning. \nBASQUIAT It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone. \nGINA You're blaming me? I had to go see my family. \nBASQUIAT I'm your family. \nGINA Basquiat, what did you take? \nJean tries to pick himself up from the floor. He gets up stiffly, like Pinnocchio. The long sleep made his limbs wooden. \nBASQUIAT Nothing special - just some weed. \nHe finds an old joint and lights it up. \nGINA Basquiat, don't lie. (holds up powder) This is smack. \nBASQUIAT You want some? \nHe offers her the joint. \nEXT. ST. MARK'S PLACE - NIGHT \nJean and Benny walk along, sharing a beer in a brown paper bag. \nThey approach a DRUG DEALER and exchange money for dope. \nJean finds a discarded window frame in a pile of trash and carries it with him. \nThey sit down on a stoop. Jean rolls up a dollar bill, empties the dope onto the window, and splits it into two lines. He hands the rolled up bill to Benny, who snorts the line. \nBenny shakes his head involuntarily, making a violent face, as though the dope burned a hole in his sinus. \nBENNY We got beat. \nBASQUIAT For real? \nJean takes a taste with his finger... He tastes his tongue and makes a face.. \nARTIST #1 (yelling from the window) Rene, man, check this out. Whoa... He's kinda cute. \nRene looks to him and back at the painting. He takes one last look. \nHe stumbles towards the window and grabs the binoculars from Artist #1.. \nWe look through the binoculars' POV at a GUY coming down the street. He's wearing all black, cowboy boots, and sunglasses. \nRENE Naaaa. Poor thing has a little dick. \nARTIST #2 How do you know? \nRENE Just look at him. \n(Rene hands the binoculars to him) Little silver thingies on his cowboy boots? Honey, I don't think so. \nHe looks around the room again as if looking for Jean. \nARTIST #3 Whoa - check it out. It's him! \nRene grabs binoculars. \nBINOCULARS POV: \nJean pauses before one of his own graffiti pieces: \n\"PLUSH SAFE, HE THINK\" \nRene watches in awe. Jean, moving a bit slowly, `signs' his tag with the copyright sign. He walks off. \nRENE MOTHAFUCKAH! \nARTIST #2 That's the same guy who did this painting. \nRENE I know that. Don't let him get away. \nHe hands the binoculars to Artist #3 and runs towards the door. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nBINOCULARS POV \nWe watch as Rene looks frantically for Jean, but can't spot him. Finally he sees Jean's hair-do bobbing up and down a block away. He runs towards it. \nRENE Hey, wait up!!! \nHuffing and puffing, he catches up. \nRENE You heard of Albert Milo. I made    that niggah. I'm Rene Ricard. Didn't    you read \"Not About Albert Milo?\" I know    who to hype. Baby, I'm gonna make you a    star. \nBASQUIAT Can you put me in the ring with him? \nRENE I can put you in the ring with him. Even book the dates. (beat) But those big boys know how to fight. They \ncould make you look real sissy. (they laugh) I was looking at that painting upstairs. It's the first time a picture made me embarrassed to own anything. (beat) So what's your real name? 'Samo?' \nBASQUIAT Jean Michel Basquiat. \nThey shake hands. \nRENE Sounds famous already. \nINT. PS 1 SHOW - DAY \nINSERT:   A huge poster reads: \n\"NEW YORK / NEW WAVE 100 ARTISTS\" \nCLOSE ON: A HAMMER, POUNDING \nJean pounds a nail into one of his pieces, nailing it directly onto the wall. Everyone stares. \nRENE Oh child... You got no respect. Didn't anyone teach you how to mount paintings? \nRene smiles. Jean finishes pounding the last piece into the wall. \nCAMERA pulls back to reveal several of Jean's paintings - found objects with paint on them. \nRENE (CONT'D) This is a very important season in New York. One's public appearance is absolute. (beat - a man approaches) Oh!!! Louise!!! I'd like you to meet Jean Michel Basquiat - (beat) SAMO. This is Henry Geldzahler. \nA crowd begins to gather around the work. \nHENRY Ohh... SAMO. I've heard a lot about you. I love your graffiti. \nGINA Staten Island would be ok. \nBeat. Silence. \nJean can't sleep. He stares at the ceiling. \nBASQUIAT Do you wanna marry me? \nBeat. \nNo reply. \nGina's asleep. \nINT. GINA'S APARTMENT (KITCHEN) - LATER (NIGHT) \nQuietly, Jean kneels on the floor of the kitchen. He paints on an old window. \nHe draws figures of three people sitting at a table - obviously a family. He crosses out one person and paints a dog under the table. \nHe crosses everything out. \nHe mixes the paint in a large bowl and starts again. \nAgain, he crosses everything out. \nINT - GINA'S APARTMENT - MORNING \nJean continues to work. He's wearing pajamas and a bathrobe. \nGina enters, waking up. \nShe looks at the painting. \nGINA Kind of a family portrait. \nJean moves to add something. She stops him. \nGINA (CONT'D) It looks done. \nBASQUIAT Think so? \nHe pauses. \nBASQUIAT (CONT'D) ... babies. \nGINA You mean babies with you? \nBASQUIAT What's wrong with me? \nGINA You're your own baby. \nJean paints out the image. \nThere's a KNOCK at the door. \nGINA Who is it? \nANNINA NOSEI (O.S) Annina Nosei. \nGINA Who? \nJean jumps up and locks himself in the bathroom. Gina goes to the door, unlocks the chain, and looks out. \nGINA (CONT'D) (through the crack) Hello? Oh. Come in. \nShe opens the door. \nANNINA NOSEI Is Jean Michel here? \nGINA No. \nClosed in the bathroom, Jean smiles while eavesdropping. \nANNINA NOSEI I'm here to see some work. \nAnnina starts noticing all the work around her. Gina hands her a stack of drawings. \nANNINA NOSEI (CONT'D) These are great. \nGINA Aren't they? \nANNINA NOSEI How much for these five? \nANNINA NOSEI Here's a very good example of his recent work that's not spoken for yet. (beat) He's got to work in a basement. He's got so much energy that if he worked in a place with a window, he'd jump right through it. Most of these are reserved already. After this week, this work will not be available. \nTOM KRUGER (to his wife) ... I don't know.... This one's nice, but I don't know if I could live with it. That green is so... institutional. \nHe (Kruger) looks up to see two KIDS enter - young black artists, one of whom we saw with Rene at the loft party. \nThey walk right into the middle of the room, completely oblivious to the presence of Annina and the Krugers.. \nKID #1 (enthusiastically) Yo, man, you're a damn lucky nigger selling this shit! \nBASQUIAT You like it? \nKID #1 Not bad. Yeah, I do. \nThe Krugers hem and haw in front of the painting next to Jean. \nCYNTHIA KRUGER I'm fascinated by his choice of crossing out words that way. \nANNINA NOSEI Yes, well, they are more meaningful in their absence, no? \nKID #1 (to Jean, joking) What does it mean? \nJean paints the words \"Rene 5:11\" back into a painting. They ignore the kid.. \nCYNTHIA KRUGER I like this one, but that green... \nSuddenly, we see LEGS coming down the stairs. It's Gina. Everyone looks at her. \nBASQUIAT Y'want me to make it a nice shit brown? \nTOM KRUGER Beg pardon? \nGina hadn't expected to find herself in the middle of this scene. \nBASQUIAT Hi. This is Gina. \nAnnina nods to her. \nGina nods to the group. \nCYNTHIA KRUGER They're something like Dubuffet's... That... childlike quality. \nGina tries to connect with Jean. He's cold. \nCYNTHIA KRUGER (CONT'D) (to her husband and Annina) \nI can't make up my mind. \nTOM KRUGER I like this one. If it were just another color.. \nBASQUIAT Get a fucking decorator. If you buy one, you'll have to change your whole lives - maybe even sell your kids! (to Annina) These paintings aren't even done yet!!! \nHe sets his brush down. As he leaves - \nTOM KRUGER (O.S.) I think we'll take the green one. \nHOLD ON: \nGina, left standing in the middle of this. \nINT. MCDONALDS - DAY \nCLOSE ON McDonald's COUNTERMAN. He smiles. \nBASQUIAT I'll take three big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie. \nCOUNTERMAN You want three Big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie. \nA line begins forming behind Jean. \nBASQUIAT Forget it .I'll take six, no, seven chocolate shakes, an order of fries, a Big Mac, and two apple pies. \nCOUNTERMAN You only want one Big Mac? \nThe people in line are beginning to get impatient. \nBASQUIAT Yeah... And make it three apple pies. \nEXT. SOHO STREET - DAY \nJean leans on a fire hydrant, eating a Big Mac. \nA pink scarf blows on the wind right in front of his face. He catches it. \nMAN (wildly enthusiastic) Jean, man!!! Let's make a record! \nWOMAN (slyly, intimately) You finally did it. \nMAN #2 (pointing to Jean, sneering) He's so fulla shit. \nMAN #3 (O.S.) How much is he getting for these? \nJean walks up to Andy Warhol. \nBASQUIAT Andy, man, thanks for coming. I'd like to paint your jacket. \nANDY WARHOL My jacket? Gee, great... (he Polaroids Jean) Your show looks great. Quite a turnout. You look great. You kids. You drink red wine with fish. You can do anything! Make paintings in the basement of your gallery? First time I've heard of that! \nThey are approached by Mary Boone, a short woman in high heels and an Armani suit). \nANDY WARHOL (CONT'D) Jean Michel, this is Mary Boone. She's got the great new gallery. \nBASQUIAT Yeah, I met her already. \nMARY BOONE (shaking Jean's hand) You should be pleased. It's a great show...I'm having a dinner later at Mr. Chow's for Albert. You should come. \nIn the background, we see Annina watching. \nANDY WARHOL You'll like it. Everyone'll be there. \nAnnina walks over to Jean with a COUPLE. \nANNINA NOSEI Jean, your parents are here. \nBASQUIAT Hi Dad. Hi Nora. \nNORA Congratulations. \nBASQUIAT Thanks for coming. \nRene appears out of the crowd. \nANNINA NOSEI (continuing to Jean's father) You must be very proud. \nFATHER I am! \nRENE How does it feel to have a genius in the family? \nFATHER It feels... good! \nJean notices Benny across the room. He slows down and waves. \nJean sees Gina across the room wearing the scarf. \nJust beyond her, he sees Big Pink approaching. \nThere must be ten people between them. \nBASQUIAT (to Rene) I'll be right back. \nHe moves towards her. Suddenly, directly in front of him are the Krugers. \nTOM KRUGER We love our painting. \nBASQUIAT Which painting? \nTOM KRUGER The green one. \nBASQUIAT Oh yeah. \nCYNTHIA KRUGER We got a couch to match. \nTOM KRUGER She's only kidding! \nLooking past the Krugers, Jean looks for Gina. He sees her. His path is blocked. \nHe presses forward, looking for Gina, getting caught in the crowd. \nJean strains to keep an eye on Gina and Big Pink.. \nBenny arrives at Jean's side holding a bottle of Jack Daniels and a shot glass. \nBENNY Willie Mays. A Toast. \nJean brushes past him. \nBASQUIAT Not now, ok? \nRENE (hissing) You fucking little whore! You sold my painting! I'm gonna tell you something, brother - when you're climbing up the ladder of success, don't kick out the rungs! Believe that shit. \nBASQUIAT I'll make you another one. \nRENE Forget it. \nHe pulls out a scrap of paper and starts writing. \nBASQUIAT Rene - \nRene shushes him... He hisses loudly, like a cat. \nRENE SHHHHHH. Later. (speaking to himself) \"What is it about art, anyway......\" \nJean pauses. He turns around and surveys the room once more. \nA blink. \nSilence. \nWe see the crowd in SLOW MOTION. \nEveryone's eyes are shut. \nRENE (O.S.; CONT'D) ... that we give it so much importance? Artists are respected by the poor because what they do is an honest way to get out of the slum using one's sheer self as the medium. The money earned is proof pure and simple of the value of that individual... The Artist. \nINT. / EXT. GALLERY - NIGHT \nThe CAMERA rises higher and higher over the crowd and follows Jean as he makes his way toward the street. \nWe begin to DISSOLVE into a MONTAGE of stills of ARTISTS: \nRENE (O.S.CONT'D) The picture a mother's son does in jail hangs on her wall as proof that beauty is possible even in the most wretched. And this is a much different idea than the fancier notion that art is a scam and a rip-off. But you could never explain to someone who uses God's gift to enslave that you have used God's gift to be free.\" \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nJean enters a waiting limo. It pulls away from the curb. \nRene finishes as the limo threads its way through the night-lit, twinkling city. \nINT. LIMO - NIGHT \nThe DRIVER is the young Rasta we saw earlier outside Ballato's driving Bruno and Andy. \nJean slumps in the back seat. \nThe driver can't help staring in the rearview mirror. \nDRIVER I really... admire you. \nBASQUIAT Me? Why? \nDRIVER \nYou did it! You made it. I'm a painter, too. \nBASQUIAT That's great. \nDRIVER Would you check out my studio some time? \nBASQUIAT Sure. I'd be glad to. \nThe limo pulls over. \nDRIVER Here? \nQuickly, Jean gets out of the limo. He leaves the door open. \nThe DRIVER watches as Jean talks to two DRUG DEALERS. \nJean jumps back into the limo. \nThe driver pulls away. In the rearview mirror, he sees Jean separate a bag from a bundle of ten. He rips it open and snorts directly from it. \nHe lays his head back and takes a deep breath. \nBASQUIAT (calm, relieved) What's your name, man? \nDRIVER They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge. \nBASQUIAT Nice to meet you, Shenge. Want a job? \nINT. MR. CHOW'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nEsther Milo, watching. \nRENE (CONT'D) I'm starving. You can't buy    advertising like this. This is the most    glamorous dinner you'll have here this    fall. How about some of that imitation    crab? \nMR. CHOW I'm not paying for the drawing with crab. It's a present to my friends. It's my birthday. \nJean finishes his drawing - a big beautiful head that fills the screen. \nRene grabs it from him. He holds it up for everyone to see. \nRENE Isn't he great? Thanks, Jean. \nHe rips the page from the book. \nRENE (CONT'D) He owes me one. \nEveryone's face drops. Mr. Chow grabs his book. He motions to a couple WAITERS - \nMR. CHOW You're too much, Rene. Get this guy out of here. \nRENE I haven't eaten yet!!! \nThe waiters grab Rene's arms. \nRENE (CONT'D) Hands off me, you faggots! I'm going. I'm going...I've kept Diana Vreeland waiting too long, anyway. \nANDY WARHOL Wow... That was a nice drawing, too, Jean. Maybe you should do another one. \nMR. CHOW (exhausted) Some other time. \nSpontaneously, David McDermott climbs onto the tabletop downstairs and sings \"Paris Je T'aime.\" \nAs he belts it out in a theatrical falsetto, he glides over glasses and plates, executing a leap to another table in mid- song. \nThe restaurant staff and OTHER DINNER GUESTS watch, agape. \nCLOSE UP - DAVID'S SHOES. \nAs David dances, Annina walks over to the table, greeting people and saying goodnight. \nANNINA NOSEI (to Jean) It's great that people are interested, but if anyone's going to buy anything, I'll handle it for you. Everything goes through the gallery, even if they come to your studio. \nBASQUIAT Sure. \nAnnina leaves. \nJean leans back in his chair, taking in this splendid new world. He pulls out a joint, lights up, inhales with pleasure, closes his eyes and smiles. \nSUPER OVER HIS FACE: \"FOUR YEARS LATER\" \nSCREEN GOES BLACK \nINTERVIEWER (O.S.) ... had twenty-three one man shows, been in forty three group shows from Zurich to Tokyo.. \nFADE UP \nINT. GREAT JONES STREET LOFT - DAY \nNote: The following scene is shot in documentary style. \nINTERVIEWER (O.S, CONT'D) ... had over fifty articles written about you, switched galleries - how many times? - DJ'd in the hottest clubs - \nJean looks out the window, yawns and rubs his eyes. He now sports dreadlocks bundled into groups of spikes sticking out of his head. He wears a wrinkled Wesleyan College T-shirt, paint- splattered jeans, and no shoes; just out of bed, it would seem. \nAn INTERVIEWER - a balding Brit with all the humor of a bank clerk - tries to buddy up with Jean on camera. \nINTERVIEWER   (CONT'D) ... one of the youngest    artists ever to be included in the Whitney    Biennial, also produced a rap record.    It's said you're quite the ladies man -    even dated Madonna for a couple months!!! (takes a breath) All at the ripe old age    of 24. One might ask: is there anything    left for Jean Michel Basquiat to do? \nJean and the interviewer face each other in front of one of Jean's paintings. Jean stares at the interviewer, incredulous. \nINTERVIEWER (CONT'D) What is it that gets you out of bed in the morning? (nervous laugh) \nBASQUIAT I hate this. Turn that off. \nJean walks off camera and disappears into his bedroom. \nShenge (the former limo driver, now working as Jean's assistant) assembles stretchers. \nSUPER: \"GREAT JONES STREET, 1985\" \nA CAMERA CREW waits in the room. Jean returns. \nINTERVIEWER We're running a little late. \nBASQUIAT Should there be? \nINTERVIEWER Tell me about it. What are you angry about? \nJean drifts off. \nBASQUIAT Mmmm. I don't know. I don't remember. \nINT. FANCY GOURMET DELI - DAY \nJean and Andy browse through the aisles. Jean piles things into his cart. \nJean approaches the specialty counter. Andy continues with the cart. \nBASQUIAT (to COUNTERMAN) Can I have some caviar, please? \nThe Counterman selects a miniscule plastic spoon of caviar and begins to put it into a tiny glass jar. \nBASQUIAT (CONT'D) I'd like to taste it, first. \nReluctantly the Counterman gives him a taste with a look like \"what's a person who looks like you doing buying caviar?\" \nJean tastes the caviar and hands him back the spoon. \nBASQUIAT (CONT'D) Is that the best quality you have? \nCOUNTERMAN Yeah, it's the best one. \nBASQUIAT I'll take the whole tin. \nCOUNTERMAN It's three thousand dollars! \nBASQUIAT I'll take it. (wipes nose with sleeve.) Andy, gimme three thousand dollars. (beat) Just the caviar - I'll get the rest. \nHe hands two one hundred dollar bills for the other items to the counterman, who checks them carefully. \nBASQUIAT (CONT'D) You check everyone's bills or just mine? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. WINDOW - DAY \nA cheap pharmacy gift shop window. Jean and Andy look in on two yellow furry stuffed ducks which are part of a larger display. \nANDY WARHOL When I was little, my brother and I used to have two ducks as pets. We called them the Rodriguez Brothers. \nThey walk into a beauty salon. \nINT. BEAUTY SALON - DAY \nJean and Andy recline on the beautician's armchairs. THREE BEAUTICIANS busy themselves with the two of them, simultaneously giving them pedicures and manicures. Jean sets down a magazine. \nBASQUIAT I wish they'd quit writing this shit about me. \nANDY WARHOL That's good. At least they're interested. \nBASQUIAT Everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors - anything with a SAMO tag on it. (beat) The other day, I just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so I did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. A week later this gallery calls me up: \"Somebody's offering us the drawing. Should we buy it for five thousand?\" \nANDY WARHOL Wow... Stop giving them away. (beat) I got an invitation to model for Comme de Garcons... You wanna do it with me? \nBASQUIAT Yeah - I'd do that... You could teach me. \nANDY WARHOL Gee. I don't need to. You're a natural. You should sign up with my modeling agent. \nJean points to Andy's ankles - they have plastic flea collars on them. \nBASQUIAT Cool. \nANDY WARHOL My dog, Archie... I woke up with flea bites... Creepy. I ran out and bought flea collars. They work really well. \nBeat. \nBASQUIAT Let's leave this town and go someplace. \nSome island. \nANDY WARHOL Let's go to    the Carnegie Museum. They have the world's    most famous sculptures all in these giant    plaster replicas. It's really great. It's    in Pittsburg. \nEXT. STREET - - DAY \nThey walk out of the beauty salon.. \nJean sees the back of a girl. She looks a lot like Gina. \nBASQUIAT Yeah, just put their bill on my tab. \nGEORGE Really? \nBASQUIAT Yeah. \nGEORGE Very well. \nHe moves off towards the executives. George whispers to the HEAD EXECUTIVE, and nods towards Jean. The executives spread the words amongst themselves. They're horrified. \nBASQUIAT (continuing) Baby, I think about you a lot. I'm really sorry about everything. You have to believe me. I'm serious. I wish, y'know, that we were - \nGINA I don't believe it, Jean - they're picking straws. \nA YOUNG EXECUTIVE, obviously the loser, takes a deep breath and heads towards them. \nYOUNG EXECUTIVE \nExcuse me... On behalf of my friends I'd like to apologize. We're really sorry. \nBASQUIAT I wish you niggahs could get it togeth- ahhhhhh. \nThe Executive reaches to shake Jean's hand. Jean puts a hundred dollar bill in his hand. \nYOUNG EXECUTIVE What's this for? \nBASQUIAT The tip. \nJean turns back to Gina. The Executive leaves them. George smiles. \nGINA You don't have to be sorry. There's no one to blame. Jean, you're a real artist. I thought I was one. You made me realize I wasn't. \nBASQUIAT What's his name? \nGina balks. Rather than face a disappointment - \nBASQUIAT (CONT'D) I have to go to the bathroom. \nINT. BARBETTA'S (BATHROOM) - DAY \nCLOSE ON JEAN - looking in the mirror. \nHe looks at himself. \nHe starts to pick at his face. \nINT. PALLADIUM - HUGE ROOM - NIGHT \nJean and Albert Milo sit on a banquette \nA huge white painting of Jean's with a dragon's head hangs on one wall to their left. On the opposite wall in back of the bar hangs another huge painting with a lot of heads, mostly black. \nLots of PEOPLE mill about a huge room. \nA GIRL - another Gina look-alike walks through the crowd. Jean's eyes follow her momentarily.. \nBASQUIAT (re: the paintings) What do you think? \nALBERT MILO \nI like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. But the black one's filled up with too many heads... (beat) I'd take some of them out. (beat) I think you're painting too fast. I wouldn't put in so many heads. Let it breathe a bit. \nBASQUIAT It's always how you would do it. This is my version. \nALBERT MILO You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime. \nBASQUIAT Why, so you could humiliate me? \nALBERT MILO No, I wanted to make a painting of you. \nEXT. UNION SQUARE PARK - DAY \nJean rides his bicycle through the park. He's looking up at the birds flying in the trees. \nANGLE ON \nThe birds. We see the statue in the middle of the park, but we have no idea where we are until we see the Mays Dept. Store sign. The birds circle in flocks, never lighting on the trees. \nEXT. THE FACTORY (ENTRANCE) - DAY \nJean presses a buzzer. He's admitted. He carries his bike on his shoulder. \nINT. THE FACTORY - DAY \nANDY WARHOL That would be a pity because you're a real painter. \nFrank arrives. \nFRANK Here's the poster for the show. \nHe presents them with a yellow poster of Jean and Andy facing each other with boxing gloves. \nINT. FACTORY - NEXT DAY \nShenge hands Andy a box. \nAndy opens the box. Inside is a football helmet with Jean's dreadlocks glued to the outside. \nCLOSE UP: Andy in mirror wearing helmet. \nCUT TO: \nINSERT \nThe screen is filled with the cover of the New York Times Magazine. Jean is featured on the cover, without his dreadlocks. \nINT. GREAT JONES ST. LOFT - NIGHT \nAs Shenge opens the door, a CROWD of people spill out. They pour into the loft. The studio is crowded with PEOPLE. (Many of them we recognize from earlier scenes in Mudd Club, Jean's opening, etc). On the wall there is a portrait of Jean by Andy. The background is a piss painting. \nInside, Jean kneels on the floor in the corner of the loft with a bunch of people around him - girls, mostly. Twenty-five copies of the Times Magazine lay stacked on the floor. \nCrouching on one knee, Jean signs a copy for a BRUNETTE. \nLooking up - \nBASQUIAT Name? \nBRUNETTE Elke. \nBASQUIAT Number? \nBRUNETTE \nA BRUNETTE walks up - \nBASQUIAT Name? \nBLONDE Monica. \nBASQUIAT Number? \nBLONDE \nAndy's assistant, Frank, arrives with CHRISTINE, 25, a model. \nBASQUIAT Yo, Frank. \nFRANK This is really great. What a nice place. \nJean is taken with Christine. \nFRANK (CONT'D) Have you met Christine? \nBASQUIAT I don't think so. \nHe's thrown off his rhythm. \nCHRISTINE Would you sign one of those for me? \nTOXIC (seen with Rene at loft party earlier) spots Jean and steps in. \nTOXIC YO! Jean, this is Ramellzee. \nRAMMELLZEE Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you? \nTOXIC Uh-oh! \nRAMMELLZEE I'm here for an interrogation. You've been called a graffiti artist and I wanna know why. All I see are scribble scrabble abstractions! \nBASQUIAT Boom. \nRAMMELLZEE Boom? As in ordnance? Are your letters \narmed? What is the prime directive of graffiti culture? Do you know, black man? \nJean likes Rammellzee enough to be patient... Toxic grins and rolls his eyes to Jean. Jean watches Christine as they go on. \nTHREE KIDS in the process of prying a door panel with crowbars. \nWe see that they're removing one of Jean's SAMO pieces from a wall. We read: \n\"PAY FOR SOUP BUILD A FORT SET IT ON FIRE\" \nJean arrives behind them. \nBASQUIAT What's up? \nKID #1 Mind your own fuckin' business. \nBASQUIAT (recognizing his work) That's mine. \nKID That ain't yours, man. Some asshole named SAMO did this. \nKID#3 He's dead. That's what I heard. \nKID #2 He ain't dead yet. He's gonna kill himself. That's why all those art fags in Soho are paying more every time we bring one of these in. \nKID #1 Stupid SAMO... Hardly any of this shit left. \nThe panel is almost pried free without a scratch. \nKID #3 This one's damn nice. I say we hang onto it if he's almost dead. \nJean shoves his way in front with a magic marker and adds a couple words; now it reads: \n\"SAMO IS DEAD\" \nBASQUIAT There you go. Now it's worth more. \nThe kids are outraged, thinking Jean's ruined their find. \nThey jump on him. \nThey beat the shit out of him. \nThey're done. \nJean lies curled up on the ground, trying to talk. \nKID #2 What's he saying? \nBASQUIAT I'm SAMO... I'm SAMO... \nKID #3 (bending close) He says he's SAMO. \nKid #1 whacks him in the back once more for good measure. \nKID #1 He wish. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nTHE SEA \nIt is flat, dead, gray. \nOminous and waiting. \nINT. GREAT JONES ST. LOFT - DAY \nWashed in sunlight, a large painting leans against the wall, the words \"HAITIAN BASEBALL FACTORIES\" scrawled through its center. \nJean lays down, watching TV. \nHe looks older now, more worn. His face is slightly swollen. His complexion is discolored. \nShenge covers a triptych with wide brush strokes of yellow paint. He circles a large, primitive figure of a black man drawn with magic marker in the center. He is careful to leave the figure intact. \nBASQUIAT Paint it out. \nSHENGE Out? \nBASQUIAT Yeah... Maybe just his arms. \n(Shenge paints out the arms) Put some Cerulean Blue there. \nJean points to the lower corner. \nShenge picks up the phone, which has been RINGING for some time. \nSHENGE It's Andy again. \nJean enters the gallery. Cleaned up. Healthier. Bruises healing. \nHe looks like he's been painting. \nMary looks up from her desk, surprised to see Jean. \nMARY BOONE Jean Michel... Crawling from the wreckage? \nBASQUIAT I need a dealer. \nMARY BOONE You have a bunch of them, don't you? Albert Milo walks in from another room. \nALBERT MILO Hey Jean! (to Mary) It'll never fit. \nMARY BOONE It'll be ok. \nALBERT MILO You better take a look. Why's your door so small? The ceilings are sixteen feet and your door's the size of a mouse hole! \nMARY BOONE \nWhy are your paintings so big? Just go home. I'll get it in. \nALBERT MILO (to Jean) You doing anything right now? \nBASQUIAT Naa.. \nALBERT MILO Let's get out of here. \nBASQUIAT See ya in an hour. (to Mary) So what do you think? \nMARY BOONE Bruno spoke to me already. We could talk about it. \nBASQUIAT I'm here. \nMARY BOONE OK. I'll be at your studio Thursday three o'clock. \nINT. ALBERT MILO'S LOFT - DAY \nAlbert shows Jean through a series of large rooms filled with enormous paintings. \nIt looks like the Cairo Museum. \nThey pause before a painting. \nALBERT MILO This is painted on a backdrop from the Kabuki theater in Japan. I painted it after Joseph Beuys died. A rebirth painting. I felt like he could've painted it, or maybe someone else was painting it instead of me. The Chinese calligraphers used to change their name mid-career so they could start over as someone else.. \nBASQUIAT Do you ever get sick of it? \nALBERT MILO Of what? \nBASQUIAT The whole thing - painting. \nALBERT MILO No. It's one of the few times I feel good. I used to have to go to work and cook every \nday. That I got sick of. \nBASQUIAT What about the shit they write? \nALBERT MILO You're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. I read that. The person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. That's your enemy, not your audience. Your audience hasn't even been born yet. It's a lie that art is popular. The only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. I'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. There're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and Andy's one of them. \nBASQUIAT I haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out. \nALBERT MILO As long as I've known Andy, he's never asked me for anything except to speak to you about getting off drugs. He's painted my picture, we've eaten dinner in God knows how many places together. But he doesn't care about me. He cares about you. You're the only person he cares about. He's your friend. Fuck that article. You want a toasted bagel with cream cheese? \nMilo's daughter STELLA (12) calls out from over the balcony. \nSTELLA (O.S.) Papa, the TV's broken... Will you fix it please? \nALBERT MILO Alright. I'll be right up. \nAlbert leaves. \nJean looks at some paintings. \nStella comes downstairs. \nSTELLA (to Jean) Hi. \nBASQUIAT Hi. \nSTELLA I've seen you before. I like your paintings a lot. Your hair was different. \nBASQUIAT \nHeld in Jean's hand. It's stalled in mid-stroke. He writes with a magic marker on the heel of two wooden clogs the word: \"TITANIC\" \nThere's a loud BANGING at the door. \nWhen it stops, the pencil tip resumes its long voyage across the page. \nMUSIC UP: Tom Waits' \"Tom Traubert's Blues\" \nEXT. GINA'S APARTMENT - DAY \nJean buzzes the doorbell. He's wearing the clogs. He's hurting. The intercom comes on. \nBASQUIAT Hello? Gina? \nMALE VOICE Who is it? \nJean recognizes Benny's voice. \nANGLE UP \nGina and Benny look out the window into the street. \nJean's a block away. \nEXT. MENTAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT \nJean gets out of a cab. He walks up to the entrance. \nThe doors are locked. He rattles them. \nInside, an OLD JANITOR keeps mopping. \nJean pounds harder, RATTLES the doors more. \nBASQUIAT Hey, come here! Please. Just for a second. Open the door. \nThe janitor gets nervous. He leaves. \nHe returns a moment later with a large SECURITY GUARD. \nBASQUIAT Open up! Open up! \nThe guard unlocks the door, hoping to settle Jean down. \nBASQUIAT (CONT'D) My mother's inside. \nGUARD Come back tomorrow. Visiting hours are over. (beat) Don't cause any trouble. \nBASQUIAT I'm not here to visit... I wanna take her home. \nThe guard gently ushers Jean out through the door. \nGUARD Don't cause any trouble. \nHe locks the door and walks off with the janitor. \nEXT. STREET - DAYBREAK \nJean, walks around, drifting, stoned. He looks up at the skyline. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nWaves crash silently over a surfer. \nFADE TO BLACK \nFADE IN: \nSTREET SOUNDS \nBENNY (O.S.) Willie Mays. \nFADE IN: \nEXT. STREET -   MORNING \nJean has been passed out on a sidewalk. \nCLOSE ON: Benny's face. \nHe leans over Jean and helps him up. \nBASQUIAT Willie Mays... Nice to see you. \n", "test1_input": "BASQUIAT (under his breath) Who's that? \nBENNY The Devil, man. Rene Ricard. Art critic - writes for Artforum. People read him. Tell him who you are.. \nBASQUIAT Who am I? \nBENNY SAMO. \nBASQUIAT Oh yeah.. \nRene lands at the counter. \nJean's gaze is still on Gina. \nShe waits on a MAN at a nearby table. \nCUSTOMER How's the special today? \nGINA It's your stomach. \nShe hurries past Jean. \nBASQUIAT Hey. \nShe slows down, not wanting to. \nBASQUIAT (CONT'D) What do you think? \nShe looks at her portrait in the syrup... She can't resist smiling. \nGINA It's me. I've never been done in maple syrup. Here's a rag. \nGina smiles. She offers him one. As she holds it out, their eyes lock. She tries to resist his smile. \nBASQUIAT (gently) Gina? \nShe puts her finger in the syrup and licks it off. \nBenny takes it all in. \nLeshko is upon them. \nLESHKO Alright. Look at you, staring at this girl, making a mess. \nHe waves Jean toward the door. \nJean takes Gina's rag and begins cleaning his mess, seemingly compliant. \nBASQUIAT How about those pancakes? \nHe brings out a roll of dimes to the tabletop and splits it open. Dimes roll all over the table and stick in the syrupy parts. The manager explodes. \nLESHKO OK! Goodbye! \nGINA Pipe down, Lech. Let him order. \nLESHKO You nuts? Let him order? You on his side? You're not such a good waitress. You get out, too. \nGINA I just don't think you're being fair. \nLESHKO I need this? \nGINA I need this? \nGina quietly removes her apron in disbelief. \nBenny gets up to leave very casually. \nBENNY (waving g'bye to Jean) Willie Mays. \nLESHKO (to Gina) That's right. You go with them. Make babies \nthe government has to pay for. \nCUT TO: \nGINA AND JEAN \nLeave the restaurant. \nBehind them, we see Rene, absorbed in his writing. \nEXT. AVE. A - DAY \n", "test1_true": "Jean gives Benny a look (i.e. 'scram'). \nBENNY Catch you later. \nBenny leaves. \nA CHILLY WIND picks up. \nJean's mood is suddenly downcast. \nThey button up their overcoats, about to leave. \nGINA What's a job, anyway? (pause) What's wrong with you? \nThe truth is, he feels awful for causing Gina's trouble, but shows it by moping like a child. \nGINA (CONT'D) No, don't tell me - you just got fired by your crazy boss. \nBASQUIAT I guess you did. \nGINA Guess I just got sick of him. \nBASQUIAT Can I walk you home? \nGINA I think I could do that alone. \nGina walks away. \nHe runs after her. \nBASQUIAT Wait, I'm in a band....We're at the Mudd Club on Halloween. I'll put you on the list. \nGina turns and looks back at Jean. \nGINA I hate the Mudd Club. \nHe catches up to her. \nGina notices a dead leaf in his hair and picks it out. \nGINA (CONT'D) Have you been camping? You could use a scrub. \nBASQUIAT I'm clean. Smell me. I always smell good. I don't know why, I just do! \nHe leans forward, offering his neck. \nGINA (smelling) You do! You definitely do. \nBASQUIAT Just come to the Mudd Club on Friday. \nGINA I don't go there. Too many party girls. \nBASQUIAT Party girls? Can I call you? \nGINA (teasing him) Yeah, if you have any dimes left. 477-0496. \nHe writes her number on his pant cuff with a big fat magic marker. \nBASQUIAT Here, this is for you. I made this. \nHe hands her the small speaker. \nShe takes it. \nGINA Thanks. \nShe admires the speaker watches him walk off. \nEXT. MENTAL HOSPITAL (OUTSIDE THE CITY) \nWe see Jean crossing a lawn outside a mental hospital. \nINT. MENTAL HOSPITAL - RECREATION / VISITING ROOM - DAY \nPSYCH. PATIENTS fill a cavernous day-room engaged in arts and \ncrafts. Some of the sadder patients stare off into space as Jean crosses the room. He carries a plate of cookies and a full glass of milk. \nHe approaches a sad, nice-looking, middle-aged black woman - the same one from the dream, earlier. She sits alone fondling a pillow in her lap. It's his mother, MATILDE. She doesn't see him coming. \nAs he sets the plate in front of her, she notices him. She recognizes him and seems pleased, even in her isolation. He kisses her on the cheek. \n", "test2_input": "It's raining heavily. Jean motions for Gina to wait under the entrance. He tries to hail a cab... And another. And another. \nA parade of them passes, but each time they slow down, they get a glimpse of Jean and drive off. \nFinally, Gina steps out of the entrance. She raises her hand, and a car pulls over instantly. \nINT. CAB - NIGHT \nThey scurry into the backseat. \nThe cab pulls off. \nEXT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nThrough a steamy, rain-wet window, we see Jean and Gina seated at a table, dining. \nThey seem to be having a nice time. \nINT. GINA'S APARTMENT - NEXT MORNING \nGina lays in bed. Daylight streams into the apartment. Jackhammers RATTLE outside. (Music: REGGAE SONG - Errol Scorcher's \"Cockroach in de Corner.\") \nEXTREME CLOSEUP \nA cockroach crawls from Gina's bedroom across the floor and into the kitchen where Jean sits naked on the floor, working on a drawing. It crawls over his drawing towards a cardboard box. \nJean rummages through a cabinet. He finds a can of bugspray. Jean tears off a side of the box. With cardboard in one hand and bugspray in the other, he forgets the cockroach. \nHe's mesmerized by the list of ingredients on the aerosol can. \nSomeone POUNDS furiously at the door. \nIgnoring the pounding, he starts listing the ingredients on the piece of cardboard, finishing his new drawing by including a symbol of a cockroach to the left of the list. \nLANDLADY Miss Cardinale... Open up for me, please! \nHe gets up and peeks through the security hole. He sees a middle- aged Hispanic woman reaching to unlock the door. He opens it. \nLANDLADY (CONT'D) Ohhh, Dios mio! \nShe stares at him levelly. \nLANDLADY (CONT'D) I just want the rent. \nBASQUIAT Why didn't you say so? Damn! She's asleep! \nJean draws on a piece of paper on the counter next to him. He hands it to the landlady. It's a a little shack with a big head next to it that says \"'Here' For Rent.\" \nThe landlady looks at him like he's crazy. She balls up the drawing and puts it in her pocket. \nGina arrives in the doorway, wearing a robe. The landlady's trapped between them. \nGINA (to Jean) What're you doing? \nThe landlady wags her finger at Gina. \nLANDLADY Next Monday. \nGina and Jean look amused as they watch her leave. \nBASQUIAT Wanna go get some breakfast? \nGINA A friend of mine offered me a job doing a little work installing a show in a gallery. He's an electrician. I was supposed to be there an hour ago. \nShe looks at the bugspray drawing on the floor. \nGINA (CONT'D) Ohh, that's nice. \nJean kisses her neck as she looks at the drawing. \nWe HOLD on the drawing. \nINT. MARY BOONE GALLERY - DAY \nWhite dust sprinkles down onto Jean's face from the ceiling. Unable to use his hands, he tries to blow the dust out of his eyes... \nHis boss, GREG, a mild-mannered hippie electrician, works above him on the ladder. Jean steadies the ladder. Greg's head is out of frame. \nThe gallery is an impressive space under preparations for an opening. \nGREG Jean, could you get me a Phillips screwdriver? \nBASQUIAT A what? \n", "test2_true": "BASQUIAT Yeah. \nJean searches through the toolbox. He picks up a screwdriver and reads the handle: \"CRAFTSMAN\" \nBASQUIAT (CONT'D) 'Phillips head,' right? \nGREG Yeah. \nJean shakes his head and puts it back. He tries a couple more - they each say \"CRAFTSMAN.\" He puts them back. \nFinally, he finds one with a different handle. It says \"G.S.C. \nBASQUIAT You don't have any!!! \nGREG That's impossible. I've got, like, five of 'em! \nHe comes down off the ladder. \nGREG (CONT'D) You're holding one in your hand!!! (beat) You've never done this kind of work before, have you? (demonstrating) See, this is a regular screwdriver, and this is a Phillips head. The cross thing... I'll tell you later what all the tools are so you'll know. \nA GROUP of people arrives. \nAlbert Milo    comes into view, tailed closely by Rene Ricard and MARY BOONE    - well dressed, petite, intense, 30. Milo, (also about 30), wears    casual clothes splattered with paint. Mary Boone is engaged in    conversation with Milo. Rene chatters away. \nGreg climbs back up the ladder. He holds a piece of wire down to Jean. Jean stares at the group while trying to be invisible. \nRENE I need to make a call, Mary. You don't mind, do you? \nMARY BOONE Certainly not. You can use my line. \nRene picks up the phone. \nRENE To Paris. Bernard Picasso - (to Mary) You know Bernard - \nMARY BOONE (wincing) Be my guest. \nJean watches the group talking. \nGREG Jean? Hold this, please. (beat - he sees why Jean's so distracted) You'll get there. But it's good to have something to fall back on. That's why I became an electrician. It pays the rent. Y'know, I'm an artist, too. \nBASQUIAT I didn't know. \nGREG I sculpt. I'm really just starting to find myself. How old are you? Twenty? You're just like I used to be. I'm forty-one. And I'm glad I haven't gotten any recognition. It gave me time to develop. \nJean watches Mary and Milo talking. \nMARY BOONE (to Milo) I can't tell you how happy I am with this show. \nMary yells across the room to Jean. \nMARY BOONE (CONT'D) (her tone impersonal) Excuse me - you - what's your name? Would you move those tools there and put them somewhere else? \nHe looks at her. \nMilo watches to see what he's going to do. \nBASQUIAT (to Milo) My name is Jean Michel Basquiat. Have you heard of me? \nALBERT MILO (amused) No. Should I have? \nBASQUIAT I'm a painter, too. \nALBERT MILO Really. Huh. Too bad. \nMARY BOONE Excuse me, would you please move those tools? \nJean looks at Milo. Milo looks back at him. \nJean walks past the tools and continues toward the door. He walks out without turning around. \nMilo smiles to himself. \nEXT. BOONE GALLERY - ALBERT MILO OPENING - DUSK \nThe ART WORLD CROWD fills the gallery. Jean lurks across the street, watching through the window. \nCabs and limousines line the block. A crowd outside blocks the street. \nJean's obviously impressed, jealous and estranged -     he feels entitled to all this. \nHe crosses the street to get a closer look. \n", "test3_input": "Annina flips on a light. \nANNINA NOSEI Here it is. \nJean looks around him. He's in a large, empty cement-floored room lit by fluorescent lights. \nINT. BASEMENT, ANNINA'S - (LATER) - DAY \nJean bends over, beginning several canvases. He pours paint on them - kind of like photographs we've seen of Jackson Pollock. We HEAR Miles Davis' \"Flamenco Sketches.\" \nINT - BASEMENT, ANNINA'S - DAY (LATER) \nGRANDMASTER FLASH'S \"WHITE LINES\" fills the room. \nThe walls are covered with half-finished, unstretched CANVASES. Two or three more lie on the floor. \nHe works like a maniac, buzzing back and forth from one painting to another, adding figures, crossing out words, all the while smoking and eating cookies. The crumbs fall onto the paintings. He walks on them. \nEvery so often, he refers to a book of DaVinci drawings. Torn pages litter the floor beneath the book. \nWe hear someone THUMPING down the stairs. \nIt's Rene. A PUPPY follows him. \nHe dumps a huge load of paint supplies, art books, and carryout ribs. The puppy sniffs around happily, licking at Jean and walking over the paintings, wagging his tail. \nHe stops the tape player and inserts some Persian music. \nJean empties some foil-wrapped bags of coke. He cuts a line of coke on a foil plate. \nRene starts reading from a poem he's evidently written: \nRENE 3rd night I called    him 'boy' He sed \"don't call    me 'boy'\" \"Well Then don't call me    'Boss'\" That Was the end for us    and I've Been seeing him for    2 1/2 years. In kangaroo court I    want to be \nAble to say I never kept a Slave. But he tricked me in To Tying him up and busting his Face. He'll jump up at my Trial Yelling 'He wupped me gud.' \nJean warms the plate 'til the coke crackles, and then \"chases the dragon,\" sucking the smoke through a straw. \nHe offers it to Rene, who refuses. He lights and hands Rene the joint. Rene takes a hit. Jean takes it back. \nJean starts to work again. \nThe PUPPY runs around, chasing after him, getting in his way, running across the paintings. Jean laughs, playing tag. The puppy gets a hold of Jean's sleeve. It unravels about ten feet. \nWhile Jean's playing, Rene spots a painting with the words \"Famous Negro Athletes.\" \nRENE Oh man! That's one looks famous already. \nWithout hearing him, Jean walks towards the painting and with a swipe, paints out what Rene is pointing to. \nRENE (CONT'D) You are a willful boy. How'm I s'posed to write about you if you keep changing everything? \nThe phone RINGS... Jean ignores it. Rene gets it - \nRENE (CONT'D) Uh huhh... Band practice? (to Jean) It's Benny. He wants to know why you're not at band practice...? \nBASQUIAT (quietly) Fuck... (to Rene) I forgot about that. \nHe sets his brush down. \nRene hold the phone against his leg. \nRENE Fuck band practice... If you're gonna be a painter you're gonna have to break a few hearts - you don't wanna be like Tony Bennett.. \nBASQUIAT Tony Bennett... What do you mean? \nRENE Singing on stage and painting in your spare \ntime. \nBASQUIAT I didn't know Tony Bennett painted. \nRENE My point exactly. \nJean picks up the phone... All he hears is a DIAL TONE. \nRENE (CONT'D) So keep painting. \nBASQUIAT Yes, Boss. (beat) If you're so smart, why are you here with me in this basement? \nRENE You're news. I want the scoop. I write it down. When I speak, no one believes me. But when I write it down, people know it's true. (beat) There's never been a black painter in art history that's been considered really important, you know? \nBASQUIAT So what? \n", "test3_true": "BASQUIAT (touched) What time is it? \nRENE \nJean regards a near-finished painting. He writes \"5:11\" on it. He crosses it out and re-writes it, \"Rene 5:11.\" Rene looks pleased. \nBASQUIAT That one's for you. \nRENE Thanks... I'll take it tonight. \nBASQUIAT I can't. After the show. \nJean continues painting. Rene slumps down onto the floor, happy - a parasite content to have a host, impressed with Jean's limitless energy. Rene closes his eyes. \nBLACK \nINT. ANNINA'S BASEMENT - LATER \nJean is bent over his work. He looks to see a pair of legs. They belong to Albert Milo. \nBASQUIAT Hey - it's the big A.M.. \nALBERT MILO Rene's been telling me about your work. \nMilo takes his time looking at the paintings. \nJean continues to work, never wanting to appear impressed by anyone. He walks on top of the paintings. \nALBERT MILO (CONT'D) Is this finished yet? \nBASQUIAT I don't know. \nALBERT MILO When's your show? \nBASQUIAT Not sure. How was yours? \nALBERT MILO I haven't decided yet. (beat) Rene, you wanna come over to the studio tomorrow. I wanna make a painting of you. \nRENE How about now? \nRene shrugs to Jean. He prepares to leave. \nALBERT MILO See you at your opening. Thanks. \nAlbert and Rene begin to ascend the stairs. Jean continues painting. The dog leaves with Rene and Albert. \nWOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Ohhh, Albert Milo, what a pleasure to meet you. \nJean's brush stops. \nALBERT MILO (O.S.) This is Rene Ricard. \nJean paints over the words \"Rene 5:11.\" \nWe hear FOOTSTEPS COMING DOWN THE STAIRS. The woman continues - \nWOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) We're Tom and Cynthia Kruger - nice to have met you. \nJEAN'S POV \nWe see Annina's legs coming down the stairs. \nREVEAL \nA man wearing a pin-striped suit and gold-rimmed glasses. The woman is wrapped in a cashmere shawl. \nANNINA NOSEI (O.S) Tom and Cynthia Kruger. \nBASQUIAT (O.S) I know. \nWe SEE that Jean continues to paint, looking down. \nANNINA NOSEI This is Jean Michel Basquiat. (beat) You've seen the SAMO graffiti everywhere. That's his. This is the true voice of the gutter. \nAs she speaks, Jean squirms. He grabs a banana from a fruit bowl. Without peeling it, he takes a big bite. And another. And another. Everyone looks uncomfortable. Annina starts showing them the paintings. \nCYNTHIA KRUGER We've seen the graffiti. I work on Wall Street. And I've heard wonderful things about the paintings. Everybody's talking about you. \nBASQUIAT Yeah. \nHe looks up at them, eating the banana. \n"}

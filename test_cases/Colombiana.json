{"train": "COLOMBIANA \nWritten by \nRobert Mark Kamen & Luc Besson \nAugust 2009 ON A BLACK SCREEN \nBOGOTA, COLOMBIA 1997 \nCLOSE ON A PAGE OF A LARA CROFT COMIC BOOK \nBeing copied, with uncanny precision, down to the last detail, by a ten year old hand clutching a pencil. \nVOICE Cataleya! \nThe page of a notebook turns, revealing neat cursive handwriting, covers the comic. \nPULL BACK TO \nINT. CAT'S HOME - DAY \nCATALEYA RESTREPO, CAT for short, a contained, very centered 10 year old, pretty, but with a toughness, sitting at the dining room table, in a well kept, but modest home, with windows that look out over the steep hillside favela, attends to her notebook. \nOn the window there are half a dozen beautiful orchid plants. The rare Cataleya orchid. All around there are packed cartons, suitcases. Moving day is at hand. \nMOTHER Cat! Is your homework finished yet? \nCAT Working on it Mama. \nHer mother, taking time off from packing, comes over to Cat, and turns the page of the notebook to reveal the Lara Croft comic and it's copy. \nMOTHER You draw beautifully my love, but if you want to be something in life you have to study. \nCAT I am studying Mama. I want to be a super hero. \nHer mother turns the page back to the lessons. \nMOTHER Better to be a doctor. A lawyer. \nCAT Are we going to see Uncle Emilio? \nMOTHER I don't know. Just waiting to hear from your father. \nCat looks up at a picture on the wall of the family. Cat, her mother, and her father. Her face carries a bit of worry. \nCLOSE ON \nDON LUIS I can't believe this. \nMid 40'S, a gentleman, calm, courteous, impeccably dressed. \nPULL BACK TO \nEXT. DON LUIS'S GARDEN - DAY \nAt a table, with bottle of liquor and two glasses, Don Luis sits opposite... \nFABIO Why not? \nCat's father. Off to the side, Don Luis's right hand man, MARCO, stands like any right hand, unobtrusive. \nDON LUIS Because I love you Fabio. Like a brother. \nFABIO And I love you Don Luis. Like a brother. \nHe turns to Marco. \nDON LUIS Can you believe this guy Marco? We started when we were little...how old were we Fabio? \nFABIO Ten. \nDON LUIS Ten year old bastards stealing apples from the carts in the market. After all we've been through. And now we're on top, he wants to leave... \nFABIO Luis, I'm going to be honest with you. You remember I had that operation? \nDON LUIS That was last year. \nFABIO Since then, I'm not a hundred percent. And you can't do this thing if you're not a hundred percent. I'm tired. \nDON LUIS So you'll take a rest. \nFABIO You know how many times we should have been dead? \nDON LUIS I don't even want to count. \nFABIO Neither do I. But you gotta think. How lucky we are to still be alive. \nDON LUIS Yeah. That's right. We're alive. And what about the future of this thing we built? \nFABIO It's yours. It's not my thing any more. \nDON LUIS I'm not going to talk you out of it, am I cabron? \nFABIO I'll always be there for you Luis. Just pick up the phone, I'm there. \nDON LUIS I'm gonna hold you to that. You bastard. (EMOTIONAL) I'm going to miss you. \nFABIO And I'm going to miss you. \nDON LUIS OK. Enough of this sentimental bullshit. Next we'll be crying like two old women. Come on! One last drink, huh? \nHe pours the liquor into the glasses. \nDON LUIS To the future. \nThey tap glasses. \nEXT. CAT'S HOME - DAY \nThe man in the SUV is on the phone. \nMAN They said he's not home yet. \nHe listens. \nMAN OK. OK. \nHe hangs up. Puts his phone back in his pocket. Walks up to Fabio's men. \nMAN Change of plans. \nHe pulls out his gun, shoots them point blank. \nINT. CAT'S HOME - DAY \nAs they are exiting the house through a rear door, the shots ring out. They see another black SUV rushing up the street. \nFABIO Back! \nHe pushes his family back inside. Fabio runs to the window. Sees his men on the losing end of a gun battle. As the men fall, and others run up the stairs firing as they retreat toward the front door... \nFABIO Too late. Get ready! \nThe Mother drops the suitcases and runs to the rear room. Fabio comes over to the unnaturally calm Cat. \nFABIO I love you very much. \nCAT I love you too Papa. \nCLOSE ON FABIO'S HAND \nReaches under the table where Cat is sitting, takes a gun strapped there. Next to the gun is a big knife. \nAnd then footsteps, coming fast outside, draw his attention. \nFABIO Alicia! \nHis wife runs into the room toting two big assed assault rifles. She tosses one to Fabio. Both of them take up shooter's positions facing the door. \nANGLE ON CAT \nSitting at the table, very still. Watching. \nANGLE ON HER MOTHER AND FATHER \nFacing the front door, hands gripping their assault rifles, sweat dripping down their faces, chests heaving, waiting, waiting, to blow anyone who comes through the door to kingdom come. \nBut they never get the chance because... \nBBBBRRRRAAAAKKKKKK!!!!!!!! \nMachine gun fire shatters the windows on both sides of the room, tearing into their bodies before they even get one shot off. Tearing the orchid plants there to shred. \nCat watches in mute disbelief, shocked, as her parents bodies are riddled with heavy caliber rounds making them twitch and dance like marionettes on wires. Their blood splattering across the room, across her. \nAnd then... \nSilence. Silence so complete it is deafening in it's absence of any sound. Cat just sits in her chair. \nAnd then the door bursts open and four gunmen storm into the room, their assault weapons trained on the only living thing in the room. \nCat. Marco enters. \nMARCO You in the kitchen. You, the bedroom. You, the back. \nThe gunmen scatter. Marco has his inquisitive eye on Cat, who does not drop her eyes, impossible to read. \nOne of the GUNMAN strides over to Cat, jams a gun to her head. Cat does not move a muscle. Does not blink. \nANGLE ON MARCO \nExamines the frame Fabio dug the chip out of. \nANGLE ON THE GUNMAN WITH THE GUN TO CAT'S HEAD \nHe chambers a round, is about to pull the trigger... \nMARCO Hey! What are you doing? \nAs the other gunmen begin to tear the house apart, looking for something, Marco strides over to Cat. The frame in his hand. \nGUNMAN Don Luis said kill everyone. \nMARCO He also said no names. \nGUNMAN She won't remember. \nHe is about to pull the trigger. \nMARCO HEY! \nThe gunman stops. \nMARCO She's a kid. \nGUNMAN So what? \nMARCO What do you mean so what? You take a kid, teach them, they have value. \nThe gunman takes his gun, lifts Cat's lip, looks at her teeth. \nGUNMAN I couldn't even get ten bucks for her in the street. \nThe gunman is about to pull the trigger again. \nAnd she drops... \nSix feet down, onto a ledge, that is just beneath the window. She flattens against the wall, holding onto the medal of her father. \nON THE BATHROOM \nOne of the gunman comes to the window, cannot fit through, looks out, does not see anybody across, then hears something beneath him, looks down, sees the tip of a shoe below. Puts his gun out the window, points it down, and.... \nBBBBRRRRAAAAKKKKKKK!!!!!! \nLets loose with a barrage from his weapon. \nON CAT \nShe watches as the bullets split the cement all around her feet. Coming inches from ripping into them. And then the barrage stops. \nON THE GUNMAN \nHis clip runs out. And as he fumbles to slam another one in... \nON CAT \nShe hears the pause. Looks out over the sprawl of houses that stretch up and down the steep hillsides of the favela. She looks down at her open palm at the small chip her father gave her. Pops the chip in her mouth, swallows, leaps over the small divide between her house and the next roof, and takes off running. \nON THE GUNMAN \nGets the clip to fit, sees Cat heading off across the roof, out in the open, exposed, vulnerable. He lifts his gun to shoot, when the gun muzzle is slammed up, peppers the ceiling with bullets. The gunman turns to Marco, holding his bloody rag wrapped hand. \nMARCO We need her alive! \nEXT. FAVELA - DAY \nCat leaps from one rooftop to another, shinnies down a drain pipe onto another roof. \nANGLE ON THE GUNMEN \nJumping down from the window of Cat's home, start to sprint across the roof in hot pursuit. \nON CAT \nShe drops down to another roof, this one filled with a vegetable patch, where an old man is gardening. \nEXT. FAVELA - DAY \nMarco exits Cat's house, wrapping his bloody hand tightly with a piece of his shirt. \nMARCO Go! Go! \nHe orders four more gunmen who have just zoomed up on motorcycles. The souped up rice rockets take off in four different directions. \nON CAT \nAs she comes off the last rooftop, down into a small alley. She sprints across to a small door. She kicks at the door, which gives way and enters... \nAN OPEN COURTYARD \nWhere a half dozen women are doing laundry by an open tap. They look up to the sight of this little girl in the blood splattered school uniform, do not say a word. And neither does Cat. She just runs through to a small gate on the far side of the courtyard, opens it, and disappears. One of the women casually hangs one of her wet sheets over the gate, hiding it. \nON THE GUNMEN \nThey crash through the vegetable garden. The old man deftly kicks a rake leaning against the wall. It falls in between the rows of tomato vines. \nWhen the gunmen sprint through, the first one trips over the rake, goes crashing through the vines, which causes the two men behind him to also trip and fall. The fourth man hurdles his fallen cohorts, bounds over the roof. \nAnd the fifth man, looks at the old man. Knows what he has done. Shoots him dead before jumping off the roof. \nON CAT \nShe races down a steep hill in the crowded favela streets. \nON THE GUNMEN \nThey enter the laundry yard. The women don't even look up. The gunmen look around, just see laundry hanging from the fence, do not see the hidden door. Race back out. \nON CAT \nShe runs down a steep alley, filled with people sitting outside their homes, chatting, playing dominoes. \nAt the end of the alley, two motorcycles appear. The riders see Cat, as she sees them. They turn their bikes into the alley... \nVRROOOM! \nAnd bear down on Cat. \nCat sprints back up the hill. She goes to escape into one of the open doors, but she finds that one after another the doors have closed shut, the people fled inside. \nThe bikes eat up the hill. Cat's legs are no match for them. It seems she will be caught any second. She ducks down a street where laundry is hung on a concealed metal pipe running the length of the alley. As Cat ducks through the sheets the gunmen gun their bikes right towards her, tear through the sheets... \nAND THE CONCEALED METAL PIPE CATCHES THEM ACROSS THEIR THROATS. \nON CAT \nShe looks back, to the dead gunmen, disappears over the hill. \nAND JUST AS SHE DOES... \nMarco, in an open top jeep, with three of his gunmen ON BOARD, comes rolling up the road. He sees Cat. \nMARCO There! \nThe jeep screeches around. Cat dashes down an alley. \nON CAT \nAs she runs up the alley with it's open sewers running on either side. \nON MARCO \nAs his jeep speeds right for her. \nON CAT \nAs she runs, her eyes go to the right, and it becomes apparent she knows exactly what she is doing. She has a plan. And she executes it. Suddenly, she leaps for the curb and... \nA SEWER GRATE. \nON MARCO \nSees Cat dive to the curb. \nMARCO No! \nON CAT \nAs she wriggles her skinny little body down the grate, with barely enough room to squeeze in. But in she does squeeze. \nON MARCO \nIn total disbelief, watching her disappear down the narrow slit in the curb. \nBoth jeeps pull up. The men jump out. Marco flattens to the street, peers into the grate, sees Cat staring up at him. \nMarco takes his gun out. Jams it in the grate... \nBAMBAMBAMBAMBAM!!!! \nEmpties his clip into the dark. When he runs out of ammo, he peers down again. \nCat is gone. The gunmen run to the next sewer grate fire into that one. Marco looks down, no Cat. \nMARCO Get down there! \nThe gunmen rip the grate out, jump down the hole. \nINT. SEWERS - DAY \nThe gunmen, following the beams of their flashlights, go tramping through the muck of the sewers, trying to find Cat. The only living things they find are rats, scurrying across their feet. \nGUNMAN (ON PHONE) We lost her! \nON MARCO \nMARCO FUCK! FUCK! \nHe kicks every car in the street in frustration. \nINT. SEWERS - DAY \nThe gunmen wait in the sewer, waiting. \nMARCO V.O. Come back out. \nThe gunmen retreat back the way they came. They do not see someone watching them go. \nANGLE ON \nA small crevice in the sewer wall. Cat has squeezed herself into the crack, almost invisible. \nEXT. STREET - SUNSET \nCars and trucks rumble along a busy thoroughfare. \nCLOSE ON A SEWER GRATE CUT INTO THE SIDE OF THE CURB \nA hand emerges. And then, Cat pulls herself out, into the street. \nPULL BACK TO CAT RISING \nShe stands at the edge of the busy thoroughfare, and looks around. She is in the heart of the city. Where tall office buildings, compete with graceful, classical mansions. In the distance, she sees the hillsides, covered with the twinkling lights of the favelas, two miles, and a world away. \nEXT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - NIGHT \nTwo Marines stand guard. Looking straight ahead. \nVOICE Excuse me... \nThe Marine looks down to Cat. Bedraggled, covered in soot and blood and shit. Holding out the card her father gave her. \nCLOSE ON THE FACE OF A MIDDLE AGED AMERICAN \nPULL BACK TO \nINT. EMBASSY OFFICE - NIGHT \nThe American looks at the card Cat gave to the Marine, hands it to another American. \nAMERICAN 1 And you say you have something for us? \nHe turns to Cat, who nods yes. \nAMERICAN 1 May I see it? \nCat takes a beat. Puts her fingers down her throat. And throws up all over the man's desk. \nAMERICAN 1 Oh jeez... \nCat reaches into the goop on the desk and comes up with the chip. She hands it over to the man behind the desk, who takes a handkerchief out and takes it from her, gingerly. He looks at the chip, looks at Cat. \nAMERICAN 1 (REPULSED) Thank you. \nCLOSE ON A COMPUTER SCREEN \nFacts, figures, names, dates, a wealth of information scrolls down. \nPULL BACK TO THE TWO AMERICANS LOOKING AT EACH OTHER \nThe biggest girl in the dorm, a head taller than everyone, and twenty pounds heavier, with bully written all over her face, saunters down the aisle right towards Cat. Her name is... \nSHERRI I'm Sherri. And you are? \nCAT Very tired. \nThe girls all around twitter. Sherri looks back at them, no good rising on her smirking face. \nSHERRI Well, 'very tired', I'm sure you want to lay down and rest your little head? \nCAT I do. \nSHERRI There's your bed... \nShe points halfway down the aisle to an empty bed. Cat is about to walk towards it, when Sherri puts a beefy hand in her chest. \nCAT But it's gonna cost you. (BEAT) Twenty dollars. \nCat looks at Sherri. Looks at the other girls all hanging on every word, waiting to see what jumps off. \nCat considers, then reaches into her jumper and extracts the twenty dollars the headmisstress gave her. Hands it over to Sherri. \nSHERRI A week. Peace has it's price, y'know what I'm saying? \nCat says nothing, just stares at Sherri. \nSHERRI Are we clear on that? \nCAT Twenty dollars a week. \nSherri opens her sweatshirt to reveal a fanny pack. She unzips it, puts Cat's twenty in with a wad of other twenties. \nSHERRI We got a smart one! \nThe other girls hoot and whistle. Sherri removes her hand from Cat's chest. \nSHERRI You can go now. (BEAT) In peace. \nCat still says nothing. She walks up the aisle past all the other girls, who remain silent. It is only after Cat has laid down on her bed, that the laughing and twittering resumes. \nCat stares at the ceiling, her hand reaches inside her jumper, takes out the medal her father gave her. She holds it close in her hand, just lays that way. \nFADE TO \nINT. DORMITORY - NIGHT \nAll the girls are asleep in their beds. Silence reigns, except for the small cries and sighs of girls asleep. \nCLOSE ON CAT \nHer eyes still open, her hand clutching her father's medal. She gets up. \nINT. HALL - NIGHT \nCat makes her way down the hall. At the end of the Hall is a door marked EXIT. But she is not looking at the exit she is looking for something else. And she finds it. A door marked: HEADMISTRESS. \nCat tries the door, it is locked. She takes her father's medal from around her neck, and uses it to pop the lock. Looking left and right to make sure the coast is clear, she enters. \nINT. HEADMISTRESSES OFFICE - NIGHT \nCat tries the drawer where the Headmistress locked her money away. She looks around, takes a letter opener off the desk, pops the drawer, extracts the envelope with her name on it. \nINT. HALL - NIGHT \nAgain Cat walks down the darkened hall, looking for another door. Finds it marked: INFIRMARY. \nINT. INFIRMARY - NIGHT \nCat walks along the cabinets containing the pharmaceuticals until she finds what she is looking for. She smashes the glass door, reaches in, extracts one bottle. \nCLOSE ON SHERRI ASLEEP \nPULL BACK TO \nINT. DORMITORY - NIGHT \nCat, with four belts slung over her shoulder, the bottle from the infirmary in one in one hand, a cloth in the other, stands over the sleeping Sherri. \nCat pours the contents of the bottle out into the cloth. Seals the bottle. Puts it down. Then takes the cloth and places it over Sherri's sleeping face, ever so gently. \nFADE TO BLACK \nEXT. HORIZON - SUNRISE \nThe sun comes up over the horizon, casts it's first rays through the windows of... \nINT. DORMITORY - MORNING \nThe sun hits the faces of the girls. As they wake, they find two very interesting things. \n1. A twenty dollar bill on each bed. \n2. Sherri fast asleep, her hands and feet tied to the post of the bed with belts, her shirt pulled up, her money belt gone. And the word THIEF written in magic marker across her stomach. And the drawing of the Cataleya orchid. \nCLOSE ON \nA kind faced Hispanic woman, a... \nTICKET AGENT Hola chica, where are we wanting to go today? \nPULL BACK TO \nINT. BUS STATION - DAY \nCat, barely up to the window, hands the ticket agent the piece of paper her father gave her. The woman looks at the paper. \nTICKET AGENT Chicago is not next door, you know. \nCat is sitting watching the street, when a pair of legs appear in front of her. Cat looks up to the man who disappeared. \nMAN Come with me. \nHe turns abruptly, heads back up the alley. \nEXT. ALLEY - NIGHT \nCat follows the man through a darkened alley. At intervals, on either side, dangerous looking men, armed to the teeth, stand in the shadows. The man opens a door, beckons Cat to enter. \nINT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT \nCat follows the man as he moves down a long hallway. Cat looks into the rooms on either side of the hall as she walks along. \nIn one room, opening out to a trucking bay, TV sets are being unloaded into a big warehouse full of stolen merchandise. \nIn another room, guns are being serviced. Lots of guns, hand guns, assault rifles. Big artillery. \nMAN Hey! \nCat's attention is drawn away from the room with the guns, to the Man holding a door open for her at the very end of the hall. \nINT. OFFICE - NIGHT \nCat enters an office with three women working on computers. Looks like any other business office. At the sight of Cat, the women get up and exit, closing the door behind them. Cat is left alone. \nShe looks around the office, when the sound of a door opening behind her. She turns to Emilio. Who approaches her cautiously, scrutinizing her. \nEMILIO Cataleya? \nNow it is Cat who hesitates. \nCAT Uncle Emilio? \nEmilio covers his mouth, seems rocked. \nEMILIO Madonna! I thought you were dead! \nHe crosses himself. \nEMILIO I thought you were all... \nCat stands stock still. Emilio takes her up in his arms, lifts her, crushes her to his chest. Cat remains suspended, emotionless for a moment. And then, for the first time emotion, real emotion, washes across her face. Her lower lip begins to tremble. Tears well up in her eyes. She bursts into tears. \nEMILIO You're safe now. \nAll the emotion, the fear, the anger that she has kept locked away deep inside, rushes to the surface in one massive wave. \nEMILIO You're safe. \nEXT. CHICAGO - MORNING \nThe sun peeks over the horizon, spreading the fog infused light coming off Lake Michigan across the sleeping city as it ascends in the sky. \nCLOSE ON \nOne beam of sunlight slips through the narrow crack between a window and the shade covering it. \nCLOSE ON \nThe ray of sunlight washes across Cat's sleeping face. She wakes slowly. Her eyes open after a long sleep. For a moment she does not remember where she is. \nPULL BACK TO \nINT. BEDROOM - MORNING \nCat looks around the clean, orderly bedroom as she gathers her thoughts. Her eyes move around the room. It is a boy's room. \nWith models of soldiers, futuristic warriors, a big poster of Al Pacino as Tony Montana in SCARFACE. A poster with every imaginable type of assault rifle. \nINT. KITCHEN - MORNING \nEmilio sits reading the financial section of the morning paper over what seems to be the remains of a very hearty breakfast. An elderly woman, grandmotherly, fills his coffee cup. \nEMILIO Gracias mama. \nA noise turns both of them to the doorway and Cat. \nEMILIO Good morning. \nMAMA Buenos diaz Cara. Come. Sit. I'll make you some eggs. \nMama caresses her face, her eyes glisten with a grandmother's love. Kisses her on the forehead, lovingly, whispers into her ear. \nMAMA You have your mother's beautiful eyes. Don't be scared. This is your home. \nSlowly, hesitantly, Cat makes her way across the kitchen to the table, where she sits opposite Emilio, tentative. \nEMILIO When was the last time you slept? \nCAT I don't know. A long time ago. \nEMILIO Well good. A growing body needs sleep. When I was your age I would sleep half the day. I don't know if it helped with the growing, but I was well rested for whatever came after. \nCAT Whose room is that? \nEMILIO My son. Your cousin. \nCAT Where is he? \nEMILIO He's dead. \nHis voice holds anger, not sadness. \nCAT Killed? \nEMILIO Yes. \nThe sergeant at the desk hears the ventilation system go off. \nSERGEANT Hey Doyle! \nHe calls to one of the other cops on duty. \nSERGEANT Go take a look at the breaker on the ventilation system, will ya? \nDoyle moves off. \nINT. AIR DUCTS - NIGHT \nCat watches the blades of the vent fan slow. When they have completely stopped she starts to move herself through the very narrow space between the now stilled blades, feet first. \nINT. ELECTRICAL ROOM - NIGHT \nDoyle enters the room, opens the electrical panel. The spoon, the weight, the spring, and the wire, fall to the floor. Doyle looks at them curiously for a moment. \nINT. AIR DUCTS - NIGHT \nCat is half way through the fan blades. \nINT. ELECTRICAL ROOM - NIGHT \nDoyle looks at the switches, going down the printed list on the door, trying to locate the right one. \nINT. AIR DUCTS - NIGHT \nCat is almost through. \nINT. ELECTRICAL ROOM - NIGHT \nDoyle finds the switch that corresponds to the ventilation system. \nINT. AIR DUCTS - NIGHT \nCat's neck passes through the fan blades. Slow going. \nINT. ELECTRICAL ROOM - NIGHT \nDoyle hits the switch for the ventilation system. \nINT. AIR DUCTS - NIGHT \nCat is just through, when the blades start moving, brush against her forehead, as she makes it to the other side with no time, and no room to spare. \nINT. AIR DUCTS - NIGHT \nCat comes to a vent, looks down, begins to loosen the vent screws. \nINT. BATHROOM - NIGHT \nCat drops down into a bathroom. Looks at her watch. Sits down, waiting. \nINT. PROTECTIVE CUSTODY - NIGHT \nRizzo is asleep in his cell. The Marshal on duty finishes his coffee. Looks at Rizzo. \nThen walks over to the door at the end of the wall. He hits a buzzer on the wall. \nINT. SECURITY MONITORING ROOM - NIGHT \nThe cop manning the bank of monitors, wakes up, sees the Marshal in the monitor. \nMARSHAL (OVER INTERCOM) Gotta pee. \nThe monitor hits a button. \nINT. PROTECTIVE CUSTODY - NIGHT \nThe door buzzes open. The Marshal passes through. \nINT. HALL - NIGHT \nThe Marshal pushes the bathroom door open. Enters. \nINT. BATHROOM - NIGHT \nThe Marshal finishes peeing, zips himself up. Turns. Right into a devastating reverse wheel kick. \nINT. SECURITY MONITORING ROOM - NIGHT \nThe cop on duty hears a buzz, looks up to the bank of monitors, and sees the Marshal standing at the door. Thinking nothing of it, he hits the buzzer. \nINT. HALL - NIGHT \nCat, propping the unconscious Marshal up, hides behind him. As the door buzzes, she maneuvers the body around, pushes through. On the other side, she drops the body, and takes his gun. \nINT. SECURITY MONITORING ROOM - NIGHT \nOn the monitor it looks like the Marshal is passing through. \nINT. PROTECTIVE CUSTODY - NIGHT \nRizzo is half asleep, when the barrel of a gun taps him on the head. He opens his eyes slowly to... \nCAT Unbutton your shirt. \nRIZZO What...? \nCAT Now. \nRizzo looks over to where the Marshal is passed out cold on the floor. He does as he is told. \nRIZZO Who the hell are you? \nCAT Not room service. \nClinging to the wall like a gekko. The dun colored wall blending with her dun colored suit. How is she doing this? \nCLOSE ON CAT'S SHOES \nThe blades fitted into the seam between the bricks. Her fingertips clinging to the small lip on the bottom of the roof's edge. \nABOVE HER \nThe cops look around the roof. \nON CAT \nShe holds there listening to the noise above. Hears noise below, looks down to see... \nEXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT \nCops searching the alley below. \nON CAT \nHanging to the edge of the building. Listening, watching. \nEXT. ROOF OF POLICE STATION - NIGHT \nThe cops, finding nothing, head back out the door. A moment later... \nCLOSE ON THE ROOF LEDGE \nCat's hand reaches up. \nON CAT \nWhen one hand has a firm grasp on the roof ledge, she lets go with the other hand and grasps the ledge, extracts the blades from the brick seams, and swings herself up on the roof. As her shoes dislodge, some mortar comes loose and falls below. \nON THE COPS BELOW \nThe crumbling mortar falls on the head of one cop, he looks down, sees the crumbly gravel, looks up, sees nothing. \nEXT. ROOF OF POLICE STATION - NIGHT \nCat lands on the roof, lays still. \nON THE COP BELOW \nHe examines the gravel, looks up again. And then moves on. \nEXT.

Begins to pull at her leotard. \nINT. CELL BLOCK - NIGHT \nThe cops look at the women's cells, heading right toward Cat's. As they reach Cat's, the same cop who did the rounds at the beginning of the night looks into her cell. Cat is laying on her side, away from them, dead asleep, in the same position she was when the cop first checked on her. The cops pause for a moment, then move on. \nCLOSE ON CAT \nHer eyes are wide open. She listens for the outer door closing, and then she breathes out, relieved. \nEXT. CITY MORGUE - NIGHT \nAn ambulance pulls up, along with the Marshal contingent in their SUV's. The Marshal's spill out of the SUV's as a gurney with a corpse is wheeled into the morgue. \nINT. MORGUE - NIGHT \nAs the Marshal's stand around, the Police Coroner begins to unbutton the shirt of Rizzo the corpse. \nCORONER What the fuck? \nHIS POV \nOn Rizzo's chest the word TRAITOR is written in thick black letters. And above them, a drawing of the Cataleya orchid. The Marshal's knows what this is. \nMARSHAL Holy shit! Call Ross. \nEXT. SMALL AIRPORT - MORNING \nThe door of a small jet opens and MARCUS ROSS, 48, a keen eyed, no nonsense all business FBI agent, followed by a team of similarly focused men and women, exits down the stairs to... \nMARSHAL Agent Ross? \nROSS Where is he? \nMARSHAL At the hospital. \nCat dressed in jeans, a scuffed leather jacket, a baseball cap, with the brim pulled low over her eyes, with her pony tail sticking out of the back, the knap sack on her shoulder, waits on line to board the bus. She keeps her back to the security camera, has her phone to her ear. A number is ringing. \nINT. EMILIO'S HOUSE - DAY \nEmilio, fifteen years older, is watching a soccer game, picks up the phone. In the kitchen, Mama is cooking. \nEMILIO Are we good? \nINTERCUT BETWEEN THE TWO \nCat moves up the line to board the bus. \nCAT We're good. \nEMILIO When are you back? \nCAT Day after. \nEMILIO I have something. \nCAT The morning after OK? \nEMILIO Can't wait to see you Cara. \nCAT Say hello to Mama. \nHe looks over to Mama at the stove, who waves over her shoulder. \nEMILIO Mama says hello back. \nHe hangs up, goes back to his game. \nINT. BUS STATION - DAY \nCat boards the bus. The doors close behind her. \nAs the camera ZOOMS up, and the bus pulls out onto the road... \nROSS V.O. See? \nINT. POLICE STATION - DAY \nRoss is pointing up at the camera Cat tilted. \nROSS He tilted the camera just enough so the angle would catch the guard, not who was holding him. \nHe turns to his team. \nROSS Twenty two murders in four years all with the same M.O. The word, the flower. He's sending a message, for sure. And I'm beginning to think it's not to us. \nAGENT 1 But we're the only ones with the information. \nROSS And we're not getting anywhere with it, are we? \nNo one on the team can dispute this. It occurs to Ross... \nROSS If the message is not for us, let's make sure the one it's intended for gets it. I want you to put it out to the press. Splash it across every newspaper, every magazine. National. I want eyeballs on it coast to coast. Monitor it. Let's see if anything comes back. \nEXT. UPSCALE RESIDENTIAL NEW ORLEANS NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY \nA Lincoln town car comes down the leafy, quiet street of well kept homes. Stops at a gate guarded by two men, who wave him through. \nEXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY \nThe car ends up in front of a very impressive house, which sits at the end of a long driveway. Toward the era of the walled property, a garage, and a guest house. MR. RICHARD, in a suit and tie, looking like a proper mid level government official, or a lawyer, exits, newspaper in hand. As he approaches the front door, Richard looks over to see two more guards, off to the side. He nods to them, knows them. They nod back. \nRichard approaches the front door, knocks. While he is waiting, he looks down at the paper. \nThe door opens. \nMARCO Mr. Richard... \nRichard looks up to a fifteen year older Marco. \nMARCO Been a long time. \nRICHARD Yes it has Marco. How's the hand? \nMarco holds up his scarred hand. \nMARCO Only hurts when it's humid. \nRICHARD Should've let us relocate you to Arizona instead of New Orleans. \nMARCO The Boss likes it humid. \nRICHARD There it is then. \nMARCO He's waiting for you. \nRichard enters. The door closes. \nINT. SALON - DAY \nDon Luis stares out a bay window, drink in hand. \nRICHARD Hello Luis. \nDon Luis turns. \nDON LUIS Hello Mr. Richard. \nRICHARD I brought you the morning paper. \nHe holds the paper up. \nCLOSE ON A PICTURE OF DEAD RIZZO ON THE FRONT PAGE. \nROSS OK. Let's try...organization... \nHe types. Data comes up. And what he sees stuns him... \nA folder marked CIA: CONFIDENTAL. ACCESS DENIED. \nROSS (FRUSTRATED) Fuck... \nOVER THE SOUND OF CHIMES... \nEXT. PEPE'S WAREHOUSE/HOME - DAY \nA ramshackle warehouse, it's windows streaked opaque with years of dust and grime, surrounded by a fence, and a weedy garden which is home to dozens of the most unique wind chimes of all sizes and shapes, made from scrap metal. And two of the biggest, most ferocious dogs on Earth, laying on their sides, asleep. \nThe dog's ears perk up; hearing something we don't, a low growl begins to rumble deep in their throats. The gate to the garden begins to open, and like a shot the dogs are up, hurling themselves toward the opening gate, eyes flashing, barking loud enough to scare the dead back to life, fangs bared, ready to kill. \nAnd then they stop cold when they see who it is coming into their domain. \nREVERSE ON CAT \nHolding two very full shopping bags. \nCAT Hi guys. \nAnd the dogs jump all over her, licking her. \nCAT Hey! Hey! \nShe pets them, plays with them. \nCAT OK. OK. Now sit. \nThe dogs obey her in a heartbeat, sitting expectantly. Not making a sound. \nCAT Now let's see what good boys you can be. \nShe reaches into one of the shopping bags, pulls out two roasts! \nCAT Top cut sirloin. \nWhich she puts down on the ground. The dog's eyes go to the chunks of meat. \nCAT Nice, huh? \nThe dogs can barely contain themselves. \nCAT Red, juicy, delicious. \nThe dogs whimper in anticipation. \nCAT Stay. \nShe picks up the shopping bags, and heads for the ramshackle warehouse. The dogs moan, but do not move, their eyes going from the meat to Cat. \nCat reaches the door. Turns. Sees the dogs looking at her. \nCAT Good boys. (BEAT) Eat. \nThe dogs pounce. Each one grabs a roast and tears into the meat with ferocious, pent up glee. Cat smiles at the sight, enters the warehouse. \nINT. PEPE'S WAREHOUSE/HOME - DAY \nThe warehouse, is filled with piles of rusting scrap metal, the cannibalized carcasses of cars, trucks, shipping containers, welding equipment, hammers tongs, all sorts of tools. In the corner is one fully built truck, a big red monster with huge demolition fenders. \nThis is home to OLD PEPE, an ancient, blind man, who is working away, building yet another set of oversized chimes out of scrap metal. \nPEPE Hola Cataleya. \nCAT Hola Pepe. I guess the boys gave me away. \nPEPE Anyone else? The barking would only have stopped when their screaming began. You spoil them. \nCAT I train them. \nPEPE If that's what you want to call it. \nCat kisses Pepe, taps one of the chimes, it makes the most ethereal sound as one chime bangs against the other. She opens a cupboard in the makeshift kitchen area, and starts unpacking the groceries. \nPEPE Did you get the beans I like? \nCAT Of course. \nPEPE And the salsa Verde? \nCAT And the salsa Verde. \nPEPE Not the one in the short bottle. \nCAT The long one. \nPEPE I hate that other one, the chili they use sucks. Did you see your uncle? \nCAT Of course. \nShe moves from the kitchen, walks across to the far wall. \nPEPE We're going to church for Easter. \nCAT As always. \nPEPE And you? \nCAT Not this year. \nUntil she reaches a big discarded safe, taller than her, with an impregnable door. \nPEPE As always. You should, you know. \nINT. VILLA - NIGHT \nWilliam is at the double doors to his massive bedroom suite, the girls are on the bed in the BG jumping around, in the skimpiest bra and panty sets, having a pillow fight. \nWILLIAM (to head of security) Bring extra security in for the night. \nHEAD SECURITY Yes sir. \nWILLIAM And make sure we're shut down tight. \nHEAD SECURITY Yes sir. Have a good night, sir. \nWILLIAM I intend to. \nThe doors close, and lock. Wild shrieks come from inside. \nEXT. VILLA - EVENING \nA van rolls up to the main gate, half a dozen security men exit. \nHEAD SECURITY There are already guys in the garden and guys out back. I want you three upstairs, two on the roof. You three downstairs. Follow me. \nAs they all enter the villa, the CAMERA lingers on the van. A figure dressed in black rolls out from under the carriage as it pulls away and disappears into the bushes. \nQUICK TIME CUTS \nTwo guards stand outside the bedroom door. Two guards are on the stairs. Three guards in the salon. Three more in the garden outside. \nINT. VILLA - NIGHT \nThe Head of Security goes around the villa checking that all the doors and windows are secure. His men are posted outside the door to the bedroom, on the stairs, in the salon. He closes lights as he goes. \nHe walks across the aquarium floor in the foyer to the front door, closes the lights, so that only the glow from the aquarium lights illuminate the dark. And he exits, closing the door behind him, turning the lock. \nCLOSE ON THE AQUARIUM \nThe sharks gliding back and forth. And then, a figure in a black wet suit, fins and a mask, with a small back back, comes gliding into through the sharks. Who just go about their business. The figure stops at the edge of the glass floor, takes something out of the back pack and very skillfully cuts a small hole in one of the glass panels that makes up the floor. \nThe diver lifts out of the aquarium, pulls back the wet suit. It is Cat. \nCat opens the backpack, removes a silencer fitted pistol. \nCLOSE ON THE BEDROOM DOORS OPENING \nCat enters, silent, closes the door, approaches the bed where William is asleep sandwiched between the three passed out girls. Empty champagne bottles and glasses are strewn about. \nCat stares down at the scene, points her gun at William. One of the girls rolls over onto William, ruining her shot. She hesitates. \nCLOSE ON WILLIAM'S FACE \nAs sits up suddenly, startled from sleep. No one is in the room. He looks around, and notices the bedroom door ajar. He is more awake now, sees the Nymphettes sleeping soundly. He rises, dressed in a silk sleeping robe. He feels something on his chest, goes over to the mirror, opens his gown and sees, painted on his chest: In red lipstick, the word THIEF, and a drawing of a Cataleya orchid. Panic starts to set in. \nWILLIAM Hello? \nNo answer. \nWilliam tip toes to the ajar door. He peeks out and sees two guards with bullets through their foreheads, blood leaked out across the white marble floor. Really panicked, he flattens himself against the inside of the door, his breath coming in gasps. \nINT. VILLA - NIGHT \nWilliam, holding the two guns of the dead guards in front of him, makes his way down stairs, past two more dead guards. Growing more and more nervous by the moment, he tries a light switch on the wall, nothing. \nThe only light comes from the ambient glow of the aquarium below. He reaches the bottom of the stairs. \nWILLIAM Anybody? \nNo answer. He crosses the aquarium floor, and when he is right in the middle... \nCAT Stop right there. \nCat comes out of the dark. In her hand, a silencer fitted pistol. \nWILLIAM Who are you? \nCAT Doesn't matter who I am. \nHe pulls the trigger on his gun. Click, click, click. He tries the other one. Again click click click. \nWILLIAM What do you want? \nCAT I want you exactly where you are. \nAnd then, without warning, she puts a bullet in both his knees. \nWILLIAM ARRRGGGHHHH! \nHe falls to the floor. The blood starts to seep out onto the glass. The sharks swim back and forth. \nWILLIAM Whatever they paid you, I'll double it! \nCAT You know the thing about sharks. You can swim with them all day and they will just ignore you, but put one drop of blood in the water and they become your biggest admirers. \nWILLIAM Please. I'll give you anything you want. Don't kill me! \nCAT I'm not going to kill you. (BEAT) They are. \nShe fires three shots into the glass square he is kneeling on. The glass shatters. William falls into the water. Grabs onto the squares on either side and props himself up. His blood runs down into the clear water. Cat turns and walks toward the door. \nWILLIAM Please! Please! \nHe struggles frantically to pull himself out. Cat exits. And then the sharks hit. WHAM! And hit. And hit. And hit. \nWILLIAM Please! Help! Help! \nHe is violently dragged under. \nCLOSE ON \nROSS ...a woman. \nCannot believe it. \nEXT. MIAMI - LITTLE COLOMBIA - DAY \nMarco and his thugs enter a small social club/bar. \nINT. SOCIAL CLUB - DAY \nA dimly lit place, where strangers are few and suspicious looks from the rough men playing pool at the back to able and lining the bar are par for the course. \nEDUARDO, a small time hood, lines up a shot with a pool cue, when a hand comes down on the ball he is about to shoot. He looks up to... \nMARCO Hello Eduardo, que pasa? \nEDUARDO I have fifty bucks on this shot. That's what's que pasa. \nMARCO (SMILING) Hey sorry. Come on. \nHe opens his arms. They hug. Eduardo is friendly, but there is a hesitation, a tension in the air. As they break marco takes a roll of cash out. \nMARCO Here. For you. \nHe goes to hand it to Eduardo. \nEDUARDO For what? \nMARCO First for fucking up your shot. Second, for an address. You remember Fabio? The Cataleya Killer? \nEDUARDO It's a long time. My memory... \nMARCO You went to school with his brother in law. What was his name? Emilio? \nEDUARDO Like I said...my memory... \nNow the men at the bar are starting to take notice. \nMARCO I have a problem. And we think Fabio's kid is behind it. \nEduardo takes the roll of bills and puts it in Marco's shirt pocket. \nEDUARDO Look Marco. I gotta be honest with you. Everyone knows you guys were playing a double game, and when the shit went down, you were the only ones who got out of it clean. \nThe men at the bar are now edging closer. One of them has a shot gun resting along his leg, inconspicuous, and conspicuous at the same time. \nMARCO So you do have a memory. \nEDUARDO Yeah. For rats. Now get the fuck out, and let me take my shot. \nMARCO OK... \nMarco looks at Eduardo, who glares at him. Eduardo goes to line up his shot. The tension in the room is thicker by the moment. As Eduardo is about to hit the ball, Marco grabs his hair and slams his forehead into the cue ball. At the same moment, Marco's two thugs whip out their guns and blast away. The shotgun wielding man, raises his gun, and as he is killed by Marco, his blast takes out one of Marco's thugs. \nIn an instant it is over. Everyone is dead, except Marco, one of his thugs, and the dazed Eduardo. Marco notices his ear is bleeding, touches it, it pisses him off that blood has soiled his white shirt. \nMARCO Fuck... \nPissed, Marco yanks Eduardo up from the floor and slams him onto the pool table. Sticks his gun in his face. \nMARCO You don't tell me what I want to know by the count of three, you scum sucking lowlife prick, your memory will be permanently disabled. One...two... \nA buzzer sounds... \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nDanny opens the door to his building. \nINT. DANNY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nDanny enters to a candle lit room and... \nCAT I brought you something. \nShe is in a very sexy lingerie top. Her hands are behind her back. \nDANNY That's real progress. Let's see. \nShe takes her hands out from behind her back, presents him with a cute little stuffed alligator. \nDANNY Wow! Just what I always wanted. \nCAT You're making fun. \nDANNY No. No. I mean, a gift from you. Something to show me you're thinking of me as more than your boy toy. \nCAT Well, there's that too. \nShe starts to peel off the lingerie. \nDANNY Wait. \nShe stops. \nCAT You don't want me? \nDANNY Of course I do. But can't we talk a little first? \nCAT What would you like to talk about? \nDANNY Oh, I don't know. Nothing. Anything. \nCAT You really want to do this? \nDANNY Yes, I do. \nCAT (AMUSED) OK. \nCat jumps out of bed, starts to dress quickly. \nDANNY Wait... \nCAT I shouldn't have done this. \nPulls on her jeans. \nDANNY Done what? \nCAT Any of it. \nDANNY Why? \nCAT Because. \nDANNY Can we talk about it? \nPulls on her top. \nCAT We already talked. I'm late. \nSlips into her shoes. Does not answer. \nDANNY I made breakfast. \nCAT I don't like eggs. \nAs she heads for the door, she turns. \nCAT Now you know something else about me. \nAnd with a small smile, she is gone. \nINT. HALL - MORNING \nOutside Danny's door, Cat crosses to the elevator, waits for it to come. As she does, she fixes her clothes a bit, her eyes on Danny's door. \nCAT (TO HERSELF) Don't come out. Please. Don't. \nThe door doesn't open. The elevator arrives. She takes a deep breath, enters. The door closes. \nEXT. PAINT SUPPLY STORE - DAY \nCat comes running in. \nINT. PAINT SUPPLY STORE - DAY \nCat hurries down the aisle, keeping an eye on the security camera. Making sure she stays on the far side, out of it's range. She stops in the middle of the aisle, starts to examine paint brushes. \nCAT Sorry I'm late. \nANGLE ON EMILIO \nStanding next to her, looking at a color chart, hidden from the security camera, as is she. He is pissed. He has the newspaper with Woogard's picture. He throws the paper in her face. Cat is taken aback by a display of anger she has never seen in this man before. \nEMILIO You said you would stop the writing! \nThen he shoves an article cut from a paper in her face. \nEMILIO Read this! \nAs she starts... \nEMILIO Seven people slaughtered in a Miami bar. I knew one of them. Years ago, in school. \nCAT So what? \nEMILIO I don't like it. This is getting too close. \nCAT Tio. Could be anyone. You're seeing things that aren't there. \nEMILIO And you are so blinded by your need for revenge that you are not seeing things that are. The handwriting is on the wall Cara. Let me read it to you. This is over. I will no longer accept jobs. I will no longer solicit jobs. You are retired. \nCAT How many people did you kill in revenge for your boy's death? How many? And you're going to give me a lecture about revenge? \nEMILIO (CALM) Cara. It's time to get a life, before you run out of time. Here. \nHe hands her an envelope. \nEMILIO Maybe this will help you understand what I am telling you. \nEmilio leaves first this time. Cat just stands there, her world rocked. She opens the envelope, takes out a photograph, looks at it. \nCLOSE ON A PHOTO OF CAT WITH HER PARENTS \nDressed for her first Communion. Everyone is smiling. She is holding a Cataleya orchid bouquet. \nON CAT \nHer eyes well up. She can't hold it anymore. She begins to cry. \nVOICE Five six. Brown eyes, hazel really, dark hair, thick, shiny... \nEXT. CAFE - DAY \nDanny is sitting with his friend RYAN. \nDANNY Great body, killer smile. (BEAT) And I think about her all day long. \nRYAN Dude, you're in love. \nDANNY You're so smart. \nRYAN Seriously. This comes from the heart. OK? (BEAT) You're nuts. (BEAT) The girl comes over, strips down, rocks your world, gets dressed, asks for nothing. Leaves. The only thing she doesn't do is bring the pizza and beer. You are living my dream. And you want to go and fuck it up with love? \nDANNY I knew you were the perfect guy to talk about this with. \nOn a larger computer screen, the various pictures of Cat, none of them conclusive. As Ross and his team look on... \nTECH We need a common base, so let's try size... \nHe punches his keyboard. The computer screen shuffles the pictures until they all match up, one on top of the other. And on the screen: SIZE CONFIRMATION: MATCH 96% \nTECH Good...now let's see...hands... \nHe focuses in on the hands on the pictures from the security tape and the ones from Danny's iPhone picture. The images start moving, matching. And when they are coordinated, on the screen: HAND CONFIRMATION: MATCH 95% \nTECH Looking good. And now... \nHe types in nose match. Again the pictures shuffle, line up. NOSE CONFIRMATION: MATCH 98% \nTECH Nice nose. \nAND THEN THE MESSAGE COMES UP: MATCH IDENTIFICATION: 100% \nTECH That's your girl. \nCLOSE ON CAT \nIn the shower. The water pelting her face. \nAS THE CAMERA WATCHES HER, IT FEELS LIKE SOMEONE ELSE IS THERE WATCHING TOO. \nINT. CAT'S APARTMENT - DAY \nCat, outside the shower. \nAGAIN, THE CAMERA WATCHES HER AS IF THERE IS SOMEONE ELSE THERE. THIS BEGINS TO FEEL A LITTLE CREEPY. VERY TENSE. \nINT. CAT'S APARTMENT - DAY \nCat, in a bra and panties, walks across to the kitchen, pours a drink. Downs half of it, then refills the glass. \nAND STILL, THERE IS THIS FEELING SOMEONE IS THERE, WATCHING. THAT AT ANY MOMENT, SOMEONE IS GOING TO POUNCE. \nINT. CAT'S APARTMENT - DAY \nCat sits by the living room window. Takes the last drop of the drink. As she looks out on the night sky, she lights a cigarette. Feeling so alone. She takes one drag on the cigarette, stubs it out. She takes the picture of herself and her parents, looks at it, sighs deeply. A tear forms. Her loneliness, her sense of isolation grows. For the first time, she seems a bit lost. \nINT. DANNY'S APARTMENT - DAY \nDanny sits by his window, also feeling a bit lost, and also, so lonely. He stares at the picture of Cat on his phone. When the phone rings. \nDANNY Hello? \nINTERCUT \nCAT It's me. \nDanny's heart goes to his throat. \nDANNY Oh my god! I can't believe it! Hello you. \nINT.

I'm so happy to hear your voice. \nNARROW... \nCAT And I'm happy to hear yours. \nUNTIL A RED BLINKING CIRCLE APPEARS ON THE MAP AROUND ONE BUILDING \nROSS We got her! I want SWAT there! All of them! Now! \nRoss and his team run out of their office. AND WE ARE BACK TO... \nDANNY You know it's so crazy. I was just sitting here, looking at your picture, thinking \"I'd wish I could call her.\" And you called. \nCat's antenna go up. \nCAT ...What picture? \nDanny gulps hard, realizing he has made a mistake. \nDANNY I'm sorry. I know I shouldn't have. But I have nothing to remember you by, except this little stuffed... \nCAT (TIGHT) What picture Danny??? \nDANNY I took a picture of you while you were sleeping. With my phone. \nAGENT 1 No ma'am everything is under control. We just need you to stay inside. May we have a look around? \nAs the FBI enters... \nINT.

SHAFT - DAY \nCat lands on the floor, next to door. She unhooks herself from the pipes, and pushes out the door. Enters through to the... \nINT. GARAGE - DAY \nCat looks around, listens, and then begins to make her way across the garage, using the parked cars as cover from the security cameras. \nINT.

SECURITY OFFICE - DAY \nRoss faces her. \nCAT Sit. \nShe motions him into the chair behind him. \nROSS Just so you know, all this? Being so smart? Covering all your bases? It's not going to matter. It's already over. The whole place is wired with web cams. \nHis moment of triumph is short lived. Cat reaches on the side of the counter. Holds up six web cams, wires ripped out. \nCAT You mean these? \nTosses the ripped out cams onto the table. \nCAT Talking about covering all your bases. Your chair is pressure wired. You move your ass one inch you don't have one anymore. \nRoss looks under the chair. Sure enough, there are several wires leading out of the bottom of the chair. He looks further to the where the wires attach to a small charge. She puts her gun down on the table. \nCAT I know what you're thinking. Maybe yes a bluff, maybe no. But you have to figure yes, given what you know about me. \nRoss does not move. \nCAT This wasn't what I had in mind for myself when I was a kid. I wanted to be on the other side of things. Like you. \nROSS So what happened? \nCAT He did. \nShe takes out an old picture of Don Luis, lifted from the internet. She takes out the picture of her parents and her as an eight year old. \nCAT This is the last time I was happy. (MORE) \nCAT (CONT'D) The next day they were dead. He killed them. \nROSS And all this? All these clues...they weren't for us. They were for him. \nCAT I didn't know how else to find him. \nROSS And you figured sooner or later we would make this public. \nCAT It took you a long time. \nROSS You're very patient. \nCAT What else do I have to be? I have no one. I did. Until this morning. I had them. \nShe takes out pictures of dead Mama, dead Emilio, dead Pepe. \nROSS You sent him a message. He sent you one back. \nCAT And now I want to finish it. \nROSS I can't help you. \nCAT Yes you can. He's protected by your government. \nROSS By a part of the government I have no way of reaching. It's CIA. I don't know why. But there's no getting through it, under it, around it, believe me, I've tried. \nCAT You're going to have to try harder. \nShe takes a photo album out, opens it. \nCAT I found this on your table inside. Your family, right? \nBegins to flip pages. \nCAT Brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews. Mother, father. Nice. \nRoss knows what is coming. \nCAT I know this sounds harsh. But until I get what I want, you'll go to a funeral a week. And you will begin to feel what I have felt all these years. \nShe places the photo album in his lap. Puts his food in the microwave, starts it. Goes to exit. \nROSS Wait... \nShe stops. \nROSS What about...? \nHe points to the chair. \nCAT When your dinner's ready, the timer on it will have expired. Then you can get to work. \nAnd she is gone. Ross watches the timer on the microwave. When it beeps, he sits a moment longer. Hesitates to get up. Little by little, he moves himself off the chair, tentative. Afraid that any moment, BOOM! Until he makes the final move, stands just enough to clear the seat, waiting for the worst to happen. And when it doesn't, he breathes a sigh of relief. \nEXT. CIA OFFICE - DAY \nA non descript building. \nINT.

Marco pulls out a set of keys, frantically tries fitting the keys to the locks. None of them work. \nMARCO Shit! \nHe runs for the door again. Just as he has his hand on the knob, two shots ring out. \nMARCO Giorgio? \nNothing. \nMARCO Tonino? \nNo answer. He checks his gun, realizes he is out of ammo. He knows his time has come. He drops is gun, backs away from the door. Backs right up to the bed, and sits down. His phone rings. \nINT. CLOSET - DAY \nDON LUIS Marco! What the hell's going on??? \nINT. BEDROOM - DAY \nMarco just stares at the door. \nMARCO Hold on. \nThere is a small sound outside the door. \nMARCO I will hold here! Run! Run! \nThe door shatters as Cat kicks her way in.

ARMORED VAN - DAY \nDon Luis fumbles with the keys, grinds the ignition in his desperation. The engine turns over. Don Luis slams the transmission into gear, but bangs into the crumbled Mercedes blocking his way. He slams the gearshift into reverse, bashes into the wall behind him, and then jerks the gear shift into drive, ramming the Mercedes with a little more room. Back and forth back and forth, Don Luis rams at the Mercedes until he has made enough room to turn the van, bang past the Mercedes, and smash his way out of the garage. \nEXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY \nThe van comes roaring out of the garage, tearing up the gardens, jumping on the driveway and speeding off to the main road. \nCat comes running from the opposite direction, two guns blazing. \nINT. ARMORED VAN - DAY \nAs bullets ping off the van, Don Luis regains some of his confidence. A small smile breaks across his face as he looks in his rear view mirror and sees Cat running and firing, losing ground. \nEXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY \nCat reaches the end of the driveway, fires her last shots, runs out of bullets. Stands watching the van head off down the road. \nINT. ARMORED VAN - DAY \nDon Luis watches her run out of ammo, standing in the road receding. \nDON LUIS (LAUGHING MADLY) I beat you bitch! You can't kill me! I am unkillable! \nEXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY \nCat stands in the road, watching the van. She takes out Marco's cellphone. \nCLOSE ON THE SCREEN \nCat scrolls the phone book. She highlights VAN. Presses SEND. \nINT. ARMORED VAN - DAY \nDon Luis is at a red light, so pleased with himself. Humming a tune. When the van phone rings. Surprised, he looks at the call coming in. MARCO. He presses the speaker. \nDON LUIS Marco? \nCAT It's Cataleya. \nDON LUIS I don't understand you. You should have been dead a long time ago. You got lucky. You escaped. You were given a second chance at a life. Why did you not take it? Why did you involve yourself with this insanity? \nCAT For something you can never understand. The love I had for my parents. And you killed that. \n", "test1_input": "FADE TO BLACK \n12 YEARS LATER \nEXT. FRESNO - NIGHT \nA sleepy California town on the way to nowhere. \nPAN DOWN TO \nEXT. SIDE STREET - NIGHT \nA police cruiser sits on a quiet street, right off a wider avenue. Main street. There is no traffic either way. The nose of the cop car juts out just off the street. \nINT. POLICE CRUISER - NIGHT \nTwo cops are sitting, peeling back the wrappers on their burgers. \nCOP 1 So then I suggest, y'know, we buy some things to spice it up a bit. \nCOP 2 Define things. \nAs they nibble and talk, they pay scant attention to a set of headlights coming up the broad avenue. \nCOP 1 A garter belt, some of those stockings that come up the thigh...it's fourteen years. Know what I mean? \nThe lights come closer... \nCOP 2 Yeah. No matter how much you like steak, sometime a lamb chop is not a bad thing. \nThe lights shine right into the car. \nCOP 1 Exactly. \nOnly then, when the lights are directly on them, do the cops turn to see a car heading right toward their front end. \nCOP 1 What the... \nCRASH!!!! \nThe front end of the cop car gets sheared right off by the impact. Glass shatters, metal crunches, airbags explode! \nANGLE ON \nThe other car. The drivers door opens. A vodka bottle falls out, clinks to the sidewalk. And a moment later, two legs emerge from the car. Two very long, very shapely legs. Legs that never end. In very high heels, and a very short mini skirt. And the face on top of it, framed by a mane of wild hair, is drop dead think-you-have-died- and-gone-to-heaven gorgeous. The whole package reads SUPERMODEL. And by the way she is weaving when she stands, and the bottle at her feet, the read is; very drunk supermodel. Who looks at the crumpled police cruiser, looks into the windshield of the cruiser at the stunned cops, and says in the most sweetly drunk voice... \nSUPERMODEL Oops... \nThe cops can't believe this. They regain their wits and bolt out of the car. \nCOP 1 That's all you have to say? Oops? \nAnd, ever so sensually, she starts to laugh. The cops look at each other, perplexed. And she keeps laughing. \nThe cops get pissed. \nCOP 1 Funny? \n...and she keeps laughing. \nCOP 1 Wanna laugh you crazy bitch? I'll give you something to laugh about! \nAnd even when they slam her to the hood of the car, jam her hands behind her back, and slap the cuffs on, she keeps laughing, and laughing. \nCLOSE ON HER CHEST \nWHERE A VERY FAMILIAR MEDALLION ON A CHAIN HANGS BETWEEN HER EXPOSED CLEAVAGE. A MEDALLION ENGRAVED WITH THE CATALEYA ORCHID. \nIT IS CAT, ALL GROWN UP. \nINT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT \nA quiet night in the small station. Cat stands in front of the booking desk, so drunk the two cops have to hold her up. A surveillance camera over the desk innocuously records everything. Cat keeps her head down, her face, obscured by her mane of hair. \nAs the SERGEANT goes through her purse, finds... \nSERGEANT No license, no registration. No ID except a library card. Well Ms... \nHe reads off the library card. \nSERGEANT Valarie Phillips in addition to all that...you're being charged here with DUI, destruction of police property, driving the wrong way on a two way street... \nCAT Is that it? \nSERGEANT Unless you can think of anything else you should be charged with. \nCAT (TIPSY) Wearing no panties? \nThe Sergeant and the arresting cops holding her up give her a long look, as do any of the other cops in ear shot, whose eyes go to her very short skirt. \nSERGEANT That's not a crime. \nCAT Thank goodness. \nAnd she teeters over, passes out cold right on the Sergeant's desk. \nSERGEANT Take her in the back, lock her up, put a cup of coffee in with her. Let her sleep it off, we'll book her tomorrow. \nThe two cops who booked her drag her out. As they do, the Sergeant and the two other cops on duty lean over to try and get a look up her very long legs and her very short skirt. \nEXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT \nThree black SUV's, with blacked out windows, come rolling up to the station. The doors open and a dozen U.S. MARSHALS jump out. Vigilant, forming a cordon around one of the vehicles, out of which comes a hand cuffed, kevlar wearing hard as nails MAFIA type. GENNARO RIZZO. \nThe Marshal's surround him, guns bristling, on the look out for any danger, and hustle him towards the doors of the police station. \nINT.

Says here you're not expected until tomorrow. \nMARSHAL Never expect the expected Sergeant. (to his men) Secure this place. \nINT. CELL BLOCK - NIGHT \nThe Marshals come down the cell block, checking everything out. They pass Cat in her cell, passed out cold, her long legs and short skirt slows their progress a bit. After a long look, they move on. \nINT. SECURE CELL - NIGHT \nRizzo is pushed into a cell. The door is slammed and locked. \nMARSHAL One man here. Two more outside the front door. Everyone else on the perimeter, in teams of two. \nHe hands out thermos bottles. \nMARSHAL It's a caffeine kinda night fellas. Eyes open. \nINT. CELL BLOCK - NIGHT \nA lone cop passes Cat's cell, doing the nightly rounds. As soon as he is gone... \nON CAT \nCat's eyes snap open. She sits up, moves with the efficiency and determination of someone who has not has a drop of alcohol. She takes a spoon from the coffee cup left for her, reaches into her mane of hair and extracts a small pin. She inserts the pin into the keyhole of the door, jiggles it. The door pops open. \nCat exits the cell, takes a broom leaning in the corner, and keeping her eye on the camera above the door, she slides along the wall, until she is just under the camera. She uses the broom handle to tilt the camera up just a bit. \nINT. SECURITY MONITORING ROOM - NIGHT \nOne lone cop sits in front of the various monitors. He does not notice that one tilts slightly up, points toward a blank wall. \nINT. CELL BLOCK - NIGHT \nCat, under the camera, unlocks the second door, slips out. \nINT. HALL - NIGHT \nCat comes into the hall where several vending machines lean against the wall. On the far side is a door marked: ELECTRICAL. She is about to head for it, when she hears a door open at the far end of the hall. \nANGLE ON THE DOOR \nAt the far end of the hall. A cop comes in, looks down the hall. Where Cat was standing he sees only the vending machines. He heads right for the machines. Puts coins in the machine, waits for his food. \nANGLE ON THE SIDE OF THE MACHINE \nWhere Cat is pressed hard against the flat surface, inches from the cop. \nThe sandwich falls, the cop retrieves it, moves off, exits down the hall. Cat waits until she hears the door shut on the far end of the wall. She crosses quickly to the door across the way, enters. \nCLOSE ON A UTILITY BOX PULLED OPEN \nRevealing the electrical control panel for the station. \nPULL BACK TO \nINT. ELECTRICAL ROOM - NIGHT \nCat stands on a narrow shelf, undoes the last screws on a vent in the ceiling with a screwdriver from the tool board on one wall. \nCat drops down, opens the electrical control panel on the wall, studies it for a moment, finds the switch she is looking for, then turns to the wall of tools, plucks some wire, a cutter, a spring. \nCat sets to work on a jury rigged mechanism with the items at hand. When she is finished, she tugs at the waist band of her mini skirt, and little by little she stretches a thin dun colored leotard suit over her whole body. She takes a small plastic vial, fills it with some water from the tap, and sets it, just so, above the device she has constructed. \nThe device is hooked to the switch she selected, a small weight hangs from the bottom of it by a wire. She sets the water container just so over the spoon from her cell. The water begins to drip a drop at a time. She closes the panel door, sets her digital watch. Hoists herself up to the vent in the ceiling, and is gone. \nCLOSE ON THE JURY RIGGED DEVICE \nWater dripping into the spoon a drop at a time. \nINT. AIR DUCTS - NIGHT \nOnce inside the grate, Cat takes one of the buttons off her blouse and presses the top of it. The button becomes a pin light, which she clasps between her teeth, starts to crawl on her stomach, pulling herself along by her elbows and her wriggling hips and knees, the light still between her teeth. \nTRACK WITH CAT \nAs she moves through the maze of ducts. On the way, she peers through the grates in each ceiling, down into one cell after another, catching various views of inmates asleep as she passes over them. Until she comes to a ventilation fan blocking the way. The fan blades go round and round. Cat looks at her watch, looks at the fan. \nCLOSE ON THE ELECTRICAL PANEL \nAnd Cat's jury rigged device. The water has almost filled the spoon, one more drop, one more drop. \nCLOSE ON CAT LOOKING AT HER WATCH \nThe digital counter goes from 4 to 3 to 2 to 1... \nCLOSE ON \nThe last drop of water drips into the spoon, the spoon tips, tugging on the wire, the wire trips the switch it is connected to, the whole device comes apart, the separate pieces fall to the floor. \nINT.

But with a bitch like this, if you get a kill shot you take it. \n...Don Luis watches, as a woman gets out of the truck. He cannot make out who it is, what with the fog and his vision... \nDON LUIS Marco? \nHe sees the woman open the rear door of the truck, and pull something out.

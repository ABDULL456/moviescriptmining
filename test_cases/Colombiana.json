{"test1_input": "The biggest girl in the dorm, a head taller than everyone, and twenty pounds heavier, with bully written all over her face, saunters down the aisle right towards Cat. Her name is... \nSHERRI I'm Sherri. And you are? \nCAT Very tired. \nThe girls all around twitter. Sherri looks back at them, no good rising on her smirking face. \nSHERRI Well, 'very tired', I'm sure you want to lay down and rest your little head? \nCAT I do. \nSHERRI There's your bed... \nShe points halfway down the aisle to an empty bed. Cat is about to walk towards it, when Sherri puts a beefy hand in her chest. \nCAT But it's gonna cost you. (BEAT) Twenty dollars. \nCat looks at Sherri. Looks at the other girls all hanging on every word, waiting to see what jumps off. \nCat considers, then reaches into her jumper and extracts the twenty dollars the headmisstress gave her. Hands it over to Sherri. \nSHERRI A week. Peace has it's price, y'know what I'm saying? \nCat says nothing, just stares at Sherri. \nSHERRI Are we clear on that? \nCAT Twenty dollars a week. \nSherri opens her sweatshirt to reveal a fanny pack. She unzips it, puts Cat's twenty in with a wad of other twenties. \nSHERRI We got a smart one! \nThe other girls hoot and whistle. Sherri removes her hand from Cat's chest. \nSHERRI You can go now. (BEAT) In peace. \nCat still says nothing. She walks up the aisle past all the other girls, who remain silent. It is only after Cat has laid down on her bed, that the laughing and twittering resumes. \nCat stares at the ceiling, her hand reaches inside her jumper, takes out the medal her father gave her. She holds it close in her hand, just lays that way. \nFADE TO \nINT. DORMITORY - NIGHT \nAll the girls are asleep in their beds. Silence reigns, except for the small cries and sighs of girls asleep. \nCLOSE ON CAT \nHer eyes still open, her hand clutching her father's medal. She gets up. \nINT. HALL - NIGHT \nCat makes her way down the hall. At the end of the Hall is a door marked EXIT. But she is not looking at the exit she is looking for something else. And she finds it. A door marked: HEADMISTRESS. \nCat tries the door, it is locked. She takes her father's medal from around her neck, and uses it to pop the lock. Looking left and right to make sure the coast is clear, she enters. \nINT. HEADMISTRESSES OFFICE - NIGHT \nCat tries the drawer where the Headmistress locked her money away. She looks around, takes a letter opener off the desk, pops the drawer, extracts the envelope with her name on it. \nINT. HALL - NIGHT \nAgain Cat walks down the darkened hall, looking for another door. Finds it marked: INFIRMARY. \nINT. INFIRMARY - NIGHT \nCat walks along the cabinets containing the pharmaceuticals until she finds what she is looking for. She smashes the glass door, reaches in, extracts one bottle. \nCLOSE ON SHERRI ASLEEP \nPULL BACK TO \nINT. DORMITORY - NIGHT \nCat, with four belts slung over her shoulder, the bottle from the infirmary in one in one hand, a cloth in the other, stands over the sleeping Sherri. \nCat pours the contents of the bottle out into the cloth. Seals the bottle. Puts it down. Then takes the cloth and places it over Sherri's sleeping face, ever so gently. \nFADE TO BLACK \nEXT. HORIZON - SUNRISE \nThe sun comes up over the horizon, casts it's first rays through the windows of... \nINT. DORMITORY - MORNING \nThe sun hits the faces of the girls. As they wake, they find two very interesting things. \n1. A twenty dollar bill on each bed. \n2. Sherri fast asleep, her hands and feet tied to the post of the bed with belts, her shirt pulled up, her money belt gone. And the word THIEF written in magic marker across her stomach. And the drawing of the Cataleya orchid. \nCLOSE ON \nA kind faced Hispanic woman, a... \nTICKET AGENT Hola chica, where are we wanting to go today? \nPULL BACK TO \nINT. BUS STATION - DAY \nCat, barely up to the window, hands the ticket agent the piece of paper her father gave her. The woman looks at the paper. \nTICKET AGENT Chicago is not next door, you know. \n", "test1_true": "Cat holds up the envelope from the headmistresses office. \nMONTAGE DAY/NIGHT \nThe landscape of America passes by through the window of a bus. Clutching a new Lara Croft comic, nibbling on a big Mac and fries out of a bag, Cat sees... \nThe sugar cane harvests in the Florida wetlands. \nTwo big fat black women sitting on the porch of a shack shelling peas in the deep South. \nThe Steel Mills of Pittsburgh fire up. \nThe endless expanse of corn and wheat stretching from horizon to horizon across Ohio. \nThe giant milk barns of Indiana with their hundreds of cows. \nAnd finally, sees the great city of Chicago looming in the distance as the bus hurls down the highway towards it. \nEXT. CHICAGO BUS TERMINAL - NIGHT \nAs seedy as any bus terminal. People bustling, people hustling. A veritable cauldron of humanity bubbling with the good, the bad, the ugly. The predators and the prey. \nCat exits into this stew of life, looks around, checks things out. As she is checked out in turn by some pretty sleazy types. \nCat ignores the eyes following her, walks up to a dwarf hawking newspapers. Hands him her slip of paper. He points her in a direction. \nMONTAGE \nCat walks across the neighborhoods of Chicago. \nSees the signs in Polish change into signs in Italian, in Spanish, Chinese, Ethiopian. \nShe hands her paper to an Ethiopian cabbie. He points her onward. \nShe walks past bars where black gangbangers watch her pass. She hands one her paper, he points her on. \nShe walks past massive churches, synagogues, mosques. \nShe walks past the stately houses of the Gold Coast, along the deserted stretches of the glam shops on Michigan Avenue, over the bridges... \nUntil she comes to... \nEXT. ROUGH NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT \nThe denizens of this world look every bit as dangerous as they are. Gangbangers, con artists, trouble waiting to happen at every turn. \nANGLE ON CAT \nCat, walking down the block as the eyes of everyone she passes follow her. She stops on a street corner. Seems lost. Opposite her a group of men, hanging outside a bar see her. The leader of the group calls her over. \nMAN Hey kid. You know what time it is? \nCat shakes her head. \nMAN It's late, and this is not the kind of place a kid should be hanging out. What are you doing here? \nCat hands him her paper. He looks at her, suspicious. \nMAN Who are you? \nCAT Cataleya. \nThe man takes a moment... \nMAN Wait here. \nHe disappears up a small alley into the darkness beyond. Cat, not knowing what to do, sits down on the curb, watches street life. She sees... \nHookers soliciting men in passing cars. \nCops sitting in a patrol car, bored, blase. \nMen playing craps against a wall. \nSome very discreet dope deals, more sleight of hand than anything else. \nCLOSE ON A FIST COLLIDING WITH A FACE \nA very bloodied face. Once, twice, three times. \nPULL BACK TO \nINT. ROOM - NIGHT \nEMILIO RESTREPO, 35, a hard case, fuck with me at your own risk written all over his face, is about to deliver another crushing blow to a poor soul strapped to a chair when... \nMAN Emilio. \nThe beating stops, Emilio turns. \nMAN There's a girl looking for you. \nEMILIO I'm not interested in a girl right now. \nHe turns back to the task at hand. Cocks his fist. \nMAN It's not that sort of thing. She's eight. \nAgain, Emilio stops. The man hands her Cat's paper. \nMAN Says her name's Cataleya. \nThis focuses Emilio's attention. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \n", "test1_id": 660, "test2_input": "FADE TO BLACK \n12 YEARS LATER \nEXT. FRESNO - NIGHT \nA sleepy California town on the way to nowhere. \nPAN DOWN TO \nEXT. SIDE STREET - NIGHT \nA police cruiser sits on a quiet street, right off a wider avenue. Main street. There is no traffic either way. The nose of the cop car juts out just off the street. \nINT. POLICE CRUISER - NIGHT \nTwo cops are sitting, peeling back the wrappers on their burgers. \nCOP 1 So then I suggest, y'know, we buy some things to spice it up a bit. \nCOP 2 Define things. \nAs they nibble and talk, they pay scant attention to a set of headlights coming up the broad avenue. \nCOP 1 A garter belt, some of those stockings that come up the thigh...it's fourteen years. Know what I mean? \nThe lights come closer... \nCOP 2 Yeah. No matter how much you like steak, sometime a lamb chop is not a bad thing. \nThe lights shine right into the car. \nCOP 1 Exactly. \nOnly then, when the lights are directly on them, do the cops turn to see a car heading right toward their front end. \nCOP 1 What the... \nCRASH!!!! \nThe front end of the cop car gets sheared right off by the impact. Glass shatters, metal crunches, airbags explode! \nANGLE ON \nThe other car. The drivers door opens. A vodka bottle falls out, clinks to the sidewalk. And a moment later, two legs emerge from the car. Two very long, very shapely legs. Legs that never end. In very high heels, and a very short mini skirt. And the face on top of it, framed by a mane of wild hair, is drop dead think-you-have-died- and-gone-to-heaven gorgeous. The whole package reads SUPERMODEL. And by the way she is weaving when she stands, and the bottle at her feet, the read is; very drunk supermodel. Who looks at the crumpled police cruiser, looks into the windshield of the cruiser at the stunned cops, and says in the most sweetly drunk voice... \nSUPERMODEL Oops... \nThe cops can't believe this. They regain their wits and bolt out of the car. \nCOP 1 That's all you have to say? Oops? \nAnd, ever so sensually, she starts to laugh. The cops look at each other, perplexed. And she keeps laughing. \nThe cops get pissed. \nCOP 1 Funny? \n...and she keeps laughing. \nCOP 1 Wanna laugh you crazy bitch? I'll give you something to laugh about! \nAnd even when they slam her to the hood of the car, jam her hands behind her back, and slap the cuffs on, she keeps laughing, and laughing. \nCLOSE ON HER CHEST \nWHERE A VERY FAMILIAR MEDALLION ON A CHAIN HANGS BETWEEN HER EXPOSED CLEAVAGE. A MEDALLION ENGRAVED WITH THE CATALEYA ORCHID. \nIT IS CAT, ALL GROWN UP. \nINT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT \nA quiet night in the small station. Cat stands in front of the booking desk, so drunk the two cops have to hold her up. A surveillance camera over the desk innocuously records everything. Cat keeps her head down, her face, obscured by her mane of hair. \nAs the SERGEANT goes through her purse, finds... \nSERGEANT No license, no registration. No ID except a library card. Well Ms... \nHe reads off the library card. \nSERGEANT Valarie Phillips in addition to all that...you're being charged here with DUI, destruction of police property, driving the wrong way on a two way street... \nCAT Is that it? \nSERGEANT Unless you can think of anything else you should be charged with. \nCAT (TIPSY) Wearing no panties? \nThe Sergeant and the arresting cops holding her up give her a long look, as do any of the other cops in ear shot, whose eyes go to her very short skirt. \nSERGEANT That's not a crime. \nCAT Thank goodness. \nAnd she teeters over, passes out cold right on the Sergeant's desk. \nSERGEANT Take her in the back, lock her up, put a cup of coffee in with her. Let her sleep it off, we'll book her tomorrow. \nThe two cops who booked her drag her out. As they do, the Sergeant and the two other cops on duty lean over to try and get a look up her very long legs and her very short skirt. \nEXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT \nThree black SUV's, with blacked out windows, come rolling up to the station. The doors open and a dozen U.S. MARSHALS jump out. Vigilant, forming a cordon around one of the vehicles, out of which comes a hand cuffed, kevlar wearing hard as nails MAFIA type. GENNARO RIZZO. \nThe Marshal's surround him, guns bristling, on the look out for any danger, and hustle him towards the doors of the police station. \nINT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT \n", "test2_true": "MARSHAL US Marshal Warren. We have Gennaro Rizzo here on an overnight. \nSERGEANT Who? \nMARSHAL Rizzo. The Mafia guy?

Says here you're not expected until tomorrow. \nMARSHAL Never expect the expected Sergeant. (to his men) Secure this place. \nINT. CELL BLOCK - NIGHT \nThe Marshals come down the cell block, checking everything out. They pass Cat in her cell, passed out cold, her long legs and short skirt slows their progress a bit. After a long look, they move on. \nINT. SECURE CELL - NIGHT \nRizzo is pushed into a cell. The door is slammed and locked. \nMARSHAL One man here. Two more outside the front door. Everyone else on the perimeter, in teams of two. \nHe hands out thermos bottles. \nMARSHAL It's a caffeine kinda night fellas. Eyes open. \nINT. CELL BLOCK - NIGHT \nA lone cop passes Cat's cell, doing the nightly rounds. As soon as he is gone... \nON CAT \nCat's eyes snap open. She sits up, moves with the efficiency and determination of someone who has not has a drop of alcohol. She takes a spoon from the coffee cup left for her, reaches into her mane of hair and extracts a small pin. She inserts the pin into the keyhole of the door, jiggles it. The door pops open. \nCat exits the cell, takes a broom leaning in the corner, and keeping her eye on the camera above the door, she slides along the wall, until she is just under the camera. She uses the broom handle to tilt the camera up just a bit. \nINT. SECURITY MONITORING ROOM - NIGHT \nOne lone cop sits in front of the various monitors. He does not notice that one tilts slightly up, points toward a blank wall. \nINT. CELL BLOCK - NIGHT \nCat, under the camera, unlocks the second door, slips out. \nINT. HALL - NIGHT \nCat comes into the hall where several vending machines lean against the wall. On the far side is a door marked: ELECTRICAL. She is about to head for it, when she hears a door open at the far end of the hall. \nANGLE ON THE DOOR \nAt the far end of the hall. A cop comes in, looks down the hall. Where Cat was standing he sees only the vending machines. He heads right for the machines. Puts coins in the machine, waits for his food. \nANGLE ON THE SIDE OF THE MACHINE \nWhere Cat is pressed hard against the flat surface, inches from the cop. \nThe sandwich falls, the cop retrieves it, moves off, exits down the hall. Cat waits until she hears the door shut on the far end of the wall. She crosses quickly to the door across the way, enters. \nCLOSE ON A UTILITY BOX PULLED OPEN \nRevealing the electrical control panel for the station. \nPULL BACK TO \nINT. ELECTRICAL ROOM - NIGHT \nCat stands on a narrow shelf, undoes the last screws on a vent in the ceiling with a screwdriver from the tool board on one wall. \nCat drops down, opens the electrical control panel on the wall, studies it for a moment, finds the switch she is looking for, then turns to the wall of tools, plucks some wire, a cutter, a spring. \nCat sets to work on a jury rigged mechanism with the items at hand. When she is finished, she tugs at the waist band of her mini skirt, and little by little she stretches a thin dun colored leotard suit over her whole body. She takes a small plastic vial, fills it with some water from the tap, and sets it, just so, above the device she has constructed. \nThe device is hooked to the switch she selected, a small weight hangs from the bottom of it by a wire. She sets the water container just so over the spoon from her cell. The water begins to drip a drop at a time. She closes the panel door, sets her digital watch. Hoists herself up to the vent in the ceiling, and is gone. \nCLOSE ON THE JURY RIGGED DEVICE \nWater dripping into the spoon a drop at a time. \nINT. AIR DUCTS - NIGHT \nOnce inside the grate, Cat takes one of the buttons off her blouse and presses the top of it. The button becomes a pin light, which she clasps between her teeth, starts to crawl on her stomach, pulling herself along by her elbows and her wriggling hips and knees, the light still between her teeth. \nTRACK WITH CAT \nAs she moves through the maze of ducts. On the way, she peers through the grates in each ceiling, down into one cell after another, catching various views of inmates asleep as she passes over them. Until she comes to a ventilation fan blocking the way. The fan blades go round and round. Cat looks at her watch, looks at the fan. \nCLOSE ON THE ELECTRICAL PANEL \nAnd Cat's jury rigged device. The water has almost filled the spoon, one more drop, one more drop. \nCLOSE ON CAT LOOKING AT HER WATCH \nThe digital counter goes from 4 to 3 to 2 to 1... \nCLOSE ON \nThe last drop of water drips into the spoon, the spoon tips, tugging on the wire, the wire trips the switch it is connected to, the whole device comes apart, the separate pieces fall to the floor. \nINT. AIR DUCTS - NIGHT \nThe fan stops. The blades slow. \nINT.

THAT AT ANY MOMENT, SOMEONE IS GOING TO POUNCE. \nINT. CAT'S APARTMENT - DAY \nCat sits by the living room window. Takes the last drop of the drink. As she looks out on the night sky, she lights a cigarette. Feeling so alone. She takes one drag on the cigarette, stubs it out. She takes the picture of herself and her parents, looks at it, sighs deeply. A tear forms. Her loneliness, her sense of isolation grows. For the first time, she seems a bit lost. \nINT. DANNY'S APARTMENT - DAY \nDanny sits by his window, also feeling a bit lost, and also, so lonely. He stares at the picture of Cat on his phone.

CLERK Lady, how can I help you? You don't even know your friend's name. 
OUISA We can find anybody - Six degrees THE CLERK closes the book. 
BACK IN THE FORMAL DINING ROOM 
OUISA We weren't family. We didn't know Paul's name. 
EXT HOGAN PLACE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE DAY 
OUISA (VO) I went to the District Attorney's office. we weren't family. We didn't know Paul's name. 
EXT THE CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING 
OUISA (VO) I called the Criminal Courts. I wasn't family. I didn't know Paul's name. 
THE FORMAL DINING ROOM 
OUISA You see, I read today that a young man committed suicide in Riker's Island. Tied a shirt around his neck and hanged himself. Was it the pink shirt? This burst of color? The pink shirt. Was it Paul? We never found out who he was. 
FLAN I'm sure it's not him. 
MRS. BANNISTER Yes. I agree. Isn't it amazing. 
FLAN He'll be back. We haven't heard the last of him. The imagination. He'll find a way. Could we talk about something else? Our guest of honor tonight- it's such a pleasure to meet you- But.THE GUEST OF HONOR FROM THE UN leans forward. 
THE GUEST OF HONOR Why does it mean so much to you? 
OUISA He wanted to be us. Everything we are in the world, this paltry thing--our life--he wanted it. He stabbed himself to get into our lives. He envied us. We're not enough to be envied. 
FLAN Like the papers said. We have hearts. 
OUISA Having a heart is not the point. We were hardly taken in. We believed him -- for a few hours. He did more for us in a few hours than our children ever did. He wanted to be your child. Don't let that go. He sat out in that park and said that man is my father. He's in trouble and we don't know how to help him. 
FLAN Help him? He could've killed me. And you. THE GUESTS agree. 
OUISA You were attracted to him - 
FLAN throws down his napkin in mock outrage. Almogj mock outrage. 
FLAN Cut me out of that pathology! You are on your own - 
OUISA Attracted by youth and his talent and the embarrassing prospect of being in the movie version of Cats. Did you put that in your Times piece? And we turn him into anecdote to dine out on. Like this. As we are right now. But it was an experience. I will not turn him into an anecdote. How do we fit what happened to us into life without turning it into an anecdote with no teeth and a punch line we'll mouth over and over for years to come. "Tell the story about the imposter who came into our lives---" "That reminds me of the time this boy--". And we become these human juke boxes spilling out these anecdotes. But it was an experience. How do we keep the experience? OUISA looks around the dinner table. THE GUESTS have decided to start on their dinners. 
FLAN (to his Dinner Partner) 
That's why I love paintings. Cezanne. The problems he brought up are the problems painters are still dealing with. Color. Structure. Those are problems. OUISA (to herself) There is color in my life, but I'm not aware of any structure. 
FLAN What are you saying, darling? OUISA looks at FLAN clinically. FLAN frowns and turns back to his dinner partner brightly. 
FLAN Cezanne would leave blank spaces in his canvasses if he couldn't account for the brush stroke, give a reason for the color. 
OUISA Then I am a collage of unaccounted-for brush strokes. I an all random. OUISA stands up from the dinner table. Her chair scrapes. There is an embarrassed rush. MRS. BANNISTER (an order) Sit down. OUISA leaves the dinner table. 
THE CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE FORMAL DINNER PARTY OUISA pushes the elevator button. FLAN comes into the hall. 
FLAN What kind of behavior is - 
OUISA God, Flan, how much of your life can you account for? THE ELEVATOR DOOR opens. 
FLAN Do you realize how important this woman is! SHE steps in the elevator. FLAN follows. 
THEY descend in silence, not wanting a scene in front of the THE OPERATOR. THE ELEVATOR DOOR opens into the lobby. 
INT PARK AVENUE LOBBY NIGHT FLAN follows OUISA through the lobby. 
FLAN Are you drunk? What are you unhappy about? The Cezanne sale vent through. The Matisse went through. We are rich. Geoffrey's rich. Next month there's a Bonnard and after that - 
OUISA These are the times I would take a knife and dig out your heart. Answer me? How much of your - 
FLAN - life can I account for! All! I am a gambler! OUISA smiles at the simplicity of her realization. 
OUISA We're a terrible match. OUISA steps out onto 
EXT PARK AVENUE NIGHT FLAN (following OUISA) She is a very important woman. I am hoping to do business! Did you see the paintings on her walls! She might want to sell! She FLAN glares at HER and turns back into the lobby and returns to the party. OUSIA moves to follow FLAN, then walks up PARK AVENUE, lost, agitated, unsure. OUISA walks on, remembering 
THE SISTINE CHAPEL. OUISA's hand completes the action. OUISA slaps the frescoed ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. OUISA slaps the Hand of God! 
PARK AVENUE OUISA gasps when SHE looks in a SHOP WINDOW

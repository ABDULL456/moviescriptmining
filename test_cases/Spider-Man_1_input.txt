SPIDER-MAN You like wrestling? 
SPIDER-MAN jumps and reaches WEINER. 
WEINER I love it! You are the best wrestler I have ever seen... please don't hurt me! 
SPIDER-MAN picks up WEINER, throws him up to an antenna above the building, to which WEINER clings desperately. SPIDER-MAN circles the antenna. 
WEINER Oh, please... don't kill me. Please help me down. 
SPIDER-MAN Of course I'll help you down. I am Spider-Man... the good guy, am I not? 
WEINER Yes... yes, you are. 
SPIDER-MAN jumps to the CHIMNEY, picks WEINER up in his arms and whispers to him. 
SPIDER-MAN And by the way, Peter Parker does not live here anymore... 
SPIDER-MAN jumps with WEINER in his arms to the edge of the roof. 
SPIDER-MAN And tell the Professor he can't have Peter's data. Goodbye. 
SPIDER-MAN drops WEINER off the roof, three floors straight down into heavy bushes below.

EXT. STREET - OUTSIDE OF A BANK - BACK DOOR - NIGHT 
An ARMORED TRUCK rolls by and stops. TWO GUARDS open the Bank's DOORS. 
Suddenly a WALDO smashes through the DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW of the ARMORED TRUCK, wrapping around the DRIVER'S NECK and pulling him through the WINDOW. The SHOTGUN goes for his weapon, but a WALDO smashes in and pulls the GUN out through his WINDOW. 
TWO WALDOS shoot out and attach themselves to the REAR DOOR. 
BANK GUARD What's going on here? 
The WALDO knocks him over. OCK rips the DOOR off! The TRUCK is full of MONEY BAGS. 
OCK Cash! 
INT. JAMESON'S OFFICE - DAY 
A PHOTO ASSISTANT look on as JAMESON goes over PETER'S latest PHOTOS. They are his SPIDER-MAN shots. 
PETER Doesn't he look amazing in that one? Look, he's flying in the air! 
JAMESON I don't care if he flies to the moon. He's just another wrestler in a silly costume. Look at this, Parker, right off the wire. This is the guy who hit that armored truck this morning. They say he has metal arms... get me a picture of this character! 
PETER Metal arms? 
JAMESON Four of them. 
PETER Ock...?! 
JAMESON The web faced weirdo... He is a joke in a Halloween costume... don't make me laugh. 
He tears up PETER'S SPIDEY PHOTOS. 
JAMESON Now get out of here and don't come back without something I can use! 
PETER Yes sir... (stops, and turns back) 
JAMESON A mega baloney... A bug in blue tights... what next? 
PETER The Journal said he was a mega-smash on MTV... 
INT. CYCLOTRON ROOM - NIGHT 
WEINER is putting on a CLOWN SUIT. He fastidiously puts his ratty jacket on a hanger and hangs it on a PIPE. The PIPE turns into a snake. It is, in fact, a WALDO! 
OCK (turning from work) What do you think you're doing? 
WEINER I'm going to the Masquerade. It's Halloween tonight Doc, aren't you coming to the School Ball? Whoa, you could go without an outfit. 
A WALDO whips around WEINER'S throat... AARRRGH! 
OCK You're not going to any ball, clown. You're going to get me Peter Parker's data... 
WEINER I was almost killed on my last try... Look at all these bruises...

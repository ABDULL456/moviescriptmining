SETH It's like me making my nuts saggier. 
Evan sees something in the distance. 
EVAN Whoa. What's this? 
SETH What? 
(CONTINUED) 58   CONTINUED:                                                        58 
EVAN Check it out! The cops! 
They see a cop car with the lights flashing parked outside the liquor store. Seth and Evan cautiously approach the liquor store and look inside. They see two POLICE talking with the Cashier, and Fogell is standing right beside them! 
EVAN (CONT'D) Shit! They busted Fogell! 
INT. LIQUOR STORE - CONTINUOUS 
The two police, OFFICER SLATER, 30 and experienced, and OFFICER MICHAELS, 25 and learning, are talking to the Cashier. Fogell stands beside them, nervous and afraid. 
OFFICER SLATER (to cashier) So, did he punch anyone else? 
CASHIER (losing it completely) I can't do this, okay!?! I told you, I have an exam tomorrow! Can you understand that? A goddamn exam! 
The cashier breaks down crying and walks off to the back of the store. The officers look at each other. 
OFFICER MICHAELS Apparently, she has an exam. 
They chuckle. Then they turn to Fogell. 
OFFICER SLATER (turn to Fogell) So then, son, you're the one that got punched? 
Fogell looks down to his bags of liquor at his feet. Then back at the cops. He nods. 
OFFICER MICHAELS We'd like to ask you a couple questions. 
The officers each take out a note pad and a pencil. 
OFFICER MICHAELS (CONT'D) Okay, first things first. What's your name? 
(CONTINUED) 59   CONTINUED:                                                      59 
Fogell looks like his heart is about to explode out of his chest. 
FOGELL My name, it's...it's.. (tripping over his own words) Mc..mac..laddle... 
OFFICER SLATER MicMac what? 
FOGELL No, no I said, "McLovin". 
OFFICER MICHAELS McLovin? 
FOGELL McLovin. 
The officers both write down some information. 
OFFICER SLATER Cool name. And your first name? 
Fogell looks twice as scared. 
FOGELL Oh...that's uh...a good one...it's a...an interesting...uh...event... 
Fogell trails off mumbling and starts to breathe heavily, making an ODD NOISE. Behind him, in the window of the store, we see Seth and Evan peeking through. 
EXT. LIQUOR STORE - CONTINUOUS 
Shocked, Seth and Evan walk away from the window. Seth starts to pace in anger. 
SETH I don't believe this bullshit! I can't...this isn't happening! I didn't even know you could get arrested for this shit! WE NEED THAT FUCKING LIQUOR! 
EVAN Oh my god. Are they gonna take him downtown? 
SETH Fuck Fogell! He got arrested! We're on our own. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 60   CONTINUED:                                                        60 SETH (CONT'D) We need a new way of getting liquor. (realizing) AAAHHH!! The money! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! How much money can you get? 
EVAN What are you talking about? Money? What about Fogell? 
SETH That doesn't matter anymore. I just lost a hundred dollars of Jules' money! 
EVAN We have to help him! 
SETH Help him? What are we gonna do? Bust him out of jail? I don't even know where jail is! What we need is the alcohol, which is impossible because we don't have any fucking money! 
Seth steps into the driveway leading to the parking lot. 
EVAN Fine. Just...calm down. We need to think. We need to think. 
SETH Fuck thinking! We need to act! 
Suddenly, a car pulls out of the lot going 10 mph and knocks Seth down!!!

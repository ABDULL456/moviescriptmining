JESSICA (VO) What?!    Yo u lost-- 
RYAN No, No!    just give me a second-- As Jessica goes off, Ryan tosses the phone down and focuses on finding the Escalade. He floors the rent-a-cop car, engine CLATTERING, to the intersection. Ryan franticly searches in every direction, but the Escalade is nowhere to be seen. He floors it. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Jesus!    Where the hell did they go? Dreading talking to Jessica, Ryan slowly picks up the receiver. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Jessica, I-- 
JESSICA (VO) You let them get away. Ryan wants to snap at her, but guilt crushes it right out of him. He knows she's right. 
DISSOLVE TO: j    INT. 15TH PRECINCT - LOCKER ROOM - DAY                           45 Mooney changes out of his blues, his ears glued to THREE COPS in the corner, boasting about an arrest. 
COP ONE -- so of course everyone's playing dumb to what kind of drugs he's on. The cops start to snicker; they've all heard that one before. 
COP ONE (CONT'D) So I start searching the place. I'm about to open a closet door when a kid with a Mac 10 jumps out of the bathroom. He shoots. Misses me and hits one of the E.M.T's. Fires again, but the gun jams and BAM! Blows half his face off. Had enough black tar heroin in the closet to resurface the 405. Mooney tries to join in on the conversation. 
MOONEY It must've been around '84, when... The Cops turn around, while grabbing their stuff. 
COP TWO Sorry Moon, we're late for a briefing. Mooney waves them on, but looks disappointed for not being able to join in. 
DEEP MALE VOICE (O.S.) I'll bet in your day you had some stories. Mooney whips his head around to see DETECTIVE JACK TOMLIN. 
MOONEY Hey Tomlin. 
DETECTIVE TOMLIN Taking off? 
MOONEY (hardly thrilled) My anniversary. You know, duty calls; pricey dinner and then some crap-ass play. (beat) Hey, I sent some college kid down to see you this morning. Had some rap about a kidnapping -- 
DETECTIVE TOMLIN I haven't seen anyone, but I'll ask around. Kidnapping, huh? 
MOONEY I thought it was a prank at first, but the kid was so worked up-- 
DETECTIVE TOMLIN Well, don't you get worked up. (slaps Mooney's chest) If the kid comes back, page me, and I'll be sure to see him. 
MOONEY (swallowing his pride) Yeah. Okay, Jack. Thanks. And as Tomlin walks off -- 
CUT TO: 
46   INT. RENT-A-COP CAR - CHUGGING THROUGH WEST L.A.                  46 Ryan lead-foots the gas. The speedometer climbs.   Forty. Fifty. Sixty miles an hour. 
JESSICA (VO) Look, Johnny, you've got to go back to the cops-- 
RYAN Are you high?! I just jacked a car! 
JESSICA (VO) Goddamn it, stop thinking about just yourself! You can explain everything to them later! 
SUDDENLY -- SFX: RYAN'S PHONE BEGINS BEEPING. 
RYAN What now? Ryan pulls the phone away from his ear and checks it out. 
INSERT SHOT - CELLPHONE FACE PLATE The BATTERY INDICATOR is flashing:         LOW BATT.   LOW BATT. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Great!   Now the battery's dying. 
JESSICA Don't you have a charger? 
RYAN It's in my car!      Hold on. SFX:   BEEP-BEEP!    The battery indicator has lost another bar. Ryan fumbles around in the armrest. Finds nothing. Opens the glovebox and -- a snub-nosed .38 SPECIAL tumbles out. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Jesus -- ! 
JESSICA What's going on? Did you find one? 
RYAN (staring at the gun) Not exactly... SFX:   BEEP-BEEP!!     Jessica starts growing afraid. 
JESSICA Johnny, don't lose me!

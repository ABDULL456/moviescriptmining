{"train": "SURROGATES \nWritten by \nJohn Brancato & Michael Ferris \nBased on the graphic novel \n\"THE SURROGATES\" \nBy \nRobert Venditti \nOctober 16, 2007 \nFADE IN ON: \nEXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT -- MOVING \nA DISTORTED IMAGE of downtown city streets at night. This is not a FISHEYE LENS, but the REFLECTION in the mirrored surface of a helmet visor. \nEXT. LUXURY BUILDING - NIGHT \nA near-future MOTORCYCLE stops near a dramatic HIGH-RISE RESIDENTIAL BUILDING. The rider, clad in black leather, climbs off his machine. We'll call him the ASSASSIN. He flips up his VISOR. His face is scarred, stubbly. He conceals himself in an alcove, eyes never leaving the building's entrance. A uniformed DOORMAN opens the high-rise's lobby door for a HANDSOME YOUNG MAN in a TUXEDO and TRENCHCOAT. THE ASSASSIN has been waiting for this. He removes what looks like a rifle scope from his jacket, aims it at \nTUXEDO. SCOPE POV - focusing on TUXEDO'S FACE, magnified. A digital readout: \"SCANNING...\" Then a long SERIAL NUMBER reads out and the name, \"LIONEL ALEXANDER CANTER,\" along with other personal information below. THE ASSASSIN puts away the scanner scope, satisfied. He reaches a hand into a pocket, withdraws a mysterious DEVICE. The size of a first generation cellphone, it has a military look, with a clear sliding panel over safety switches and buttons. The ASSASSIN hurries toward TUXEDO, but before he can \nREACH HIM-- A sleek, futuristic LIMOUSINE pulls up and TUXEDO gets in the back. They're gone in an instant. The ASSASSIN, frustrated, dashes for his MOTORCYCLE. He starts it and pursues the limousine. \nEXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT \nTHE MOTORCYCLE pursues the LIMOUSINE along the Potomac, D. C. LANDMARKS visible in the distance. \nEXT. KENNEDY CENTER - NIGHT \nFORMAL CROWDS, a RED CARPET, signs for an OPERA. The LIMOUSINE approaches. \nINT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT \nTUXEDO leans forward to the DRIVER, a muscular, handsome man in a suit named ARMANDO. \nTUXEDO I'm not really in the mood for opera, Armando. ARMANDO nods knowingly pulls back into traffic. \nARMANDO F Street? \nTUXEDO \n(UNDOING BOWTIE) You read my mind. Let's not mention this to my Dad... As he speaks, he passes a few BILLS over the seat. \nEXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT \nTHE LIMO moves through this seemingly deserted area, pulls up near a STEEL DOOR with a spray-painted X. TUXEDO emerges sans jacket and tie, his dress-shirt open. \nTUXEDO I can find my way back. ARMANDO nods and pulls away. TUXEDO moves toward the entrance, says a word into an INTERCOM with a SURVEILLANCE CAMERA. The door opens within moments, he disappears inside. THE ASSASSIN parks his bike, a few steps behind. Tuxedo has vanished through the STEEL DOOR before he can catch up with him. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: The ASSASSIN takes off his helmet, tries the door. It won't move. He buzzes the intercom. The DOOR slides open a crack-- THE BOUNCER is a huge, bald man with JET BLACK skin, RED EYES and TEETH that glow fluorescently. The THROBBING BEAT of MUSIC within. The BOUNCER narrows his eyes. \nBOUNCER This is a private club. \nASSASSIN I just need to talk to-- THE STEEL DOOR has already shut in his face. \nINT. THE PIT - NIGHT \nPOUNDING MUSIC. BODIES SLAM together in a brutal mosh pit, MEN and WOMEN. All are young, some beautiful, others extremely decorated and pierced. They tear at each other brutally, trying to do real damage. On the edges of the pit, individual FISTFIGHTS go on. An incongruous CHANDELIER overhead, gilt-edged MIRRORS on the walls-- the FIGHTERS SLAM INTO and SHATTER them. A HARD-CORE BAND plays on an elevated stage. The MUSICIANS are heavily punked out, in outlandish clothes, with pierced faces, tattoos and body make-up. IN A VIP AREA, a balcony elevated above the stage, numerous BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE at tables. Many are making out, gay, straight, threesomes-- orgies happen up here. TUXEDO sits by himself. He raises a GLASS TUBE attached to a CORD, one of a few leading into an ELECTRONIC DEVICE on the table. As he brings the tube close to his own neck, an ARC of electricity jumps to his skin. His features go slack, a shudder goes through him. Then he lowers the tube with a smile. He's using a JACKER-- a sort of electro-shock hookah. A SHOUT over the MUSIC: \nBLONDE Mind if I join you? A stunningly beautiful BLONDE in edgy, dramatic clothes stands nearby. Tuxedo, recovering from the hit, gestures graciously for her to sit. She picks up one of the cords, gives him a sly smile. She opens her mouth, SPARKS fly to her tongue and-- \nCUT TO: \nON GREER'S SCANNER - \"NEW-U RENTAL AGENCY,\" with an ID NUMBER, but no name. GREER kneels beside the PSYCHO's body, pockets his scanner. He's angry but resigned, he was half expecting this. THE SEMI DRIVER is still behind the wheel of his rig. He calls out to Greer: \nSEMI DRIVER Am I in trouble? \nGREER (waves him off) Nah, go back to work. GREER rises as his PHONE CHIMES, he touches his earpiece. IN BG, the DRIVER pulls away. \nGREER (CONT'D) \nPETERS (FILTER) \nGREER He's a rental. He disconnects, reaches to turn the PSYCHO's head to one side. The back of his skull is smashed. Instead of gore and brains, we see torn GRAY PLASTIC and dense CIRCUITRY, oozing pinkish hydraulic fluid at his neck. We're in a world of SURROGATES, remotely operated synthetic humans (also known as SYNTHs). These are not artificially-intelligent robots-- each is linked directly to a human being, miles or hundreds of miles away. Surrogates are distinguishable from flesh-and-blood humans primarily by their physical perfection-- ugly surrogates are rare. On closer look, their eyes may have an inhuman quality. Without a human mind sending and receiving impulses, they are completely inert. Suddenly the PSYCHO comes to life, spins his head around at an impossible angle and BITES GREER'S HAND. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: He won't let go. Greer stomps on the-PSYCHO's head, reaches with his other hand into the back of the skull to wrench out a CIRCUIT BOARD. The PSYCHO finally stops writhing, disconnected. \nINT. PSYCHO'S LAIR - NIGHT \nPETERS talks on the phone while scanning a SEVERED HEAD. \nPETERS I don't recommend reconnecting, Ms. Welles... hello? The WOMAN on the floor TWITCHES, her eyes open. She sits up on her elbows, looks down to see-- --her legs are gone. The bottom half of her is missing, her tattered T-shirt covers the damage, soaked with dark green and pink liquids-- coolant and hydraulic fluids. \nVICTIM Aw crap, I'm totalled! \nPETERS Your insurance ought to cover it. \nEXT. ABANDONED PROJECTS - NIGHT \nGREER trudges toward the building, on his cell, leaving the body behind. He turns the CIRCUIT BOARD over in his fingers. \nGREER --trash pick-up on Maple and 4th. \nDISPATCHER (FILTER) Coulda just called it in, we'd a shut him down from here-- \nGREER Any ID from the rental agency? \nDISPATCHER (FILTER) Yeah, got a name from their office in Miami. Ness, Harold P. \nGREER \n(A BEAT) Harry P. Ness. \nDISPATCHER Oh. False ID? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGREER You think? \nDISPATCHER Don't be in a rush to get home, Tom. Two surries down outside The Pit, hard-core club on F street. GREER picks up the pace, heads OUT OF FRAME. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT \nSTART ON THE BLONDE, eyes empty, face against the cement. \nPETERS Abandoned. \nGREER Or something happened to the operator. GREER and PETERS stand over the corpse, a UNIFORM stands nearby. Greer holds his SCANNER near her head. \nGREER (CONT'D) Registered to a Cameron Michaels, out in Clarksburg... \n(TO UNIFORM) You call her? \nUNIFORM Left a message. GREER is leaning closer to the dead Blonde's face. X-CLOSE-- CRACKS in the GLASS of her eye. We see GREER'S FRAGMENTED REFLECTION as he peers at this. \nGREER Optics are damaged. \nPETERS Musta cracked when she fell. \nCOMMERCIAL V.0. (CONT'D) Now... a better world. A BEAUTIFUL GIRL ENTERS FRAME, turns TO CAMERA and smiles. Behind her, more happy, healthy, handsome YOUNG PEOPLE in an abstract, WHITE SPACE. WIDER, there are THOUSANDS of them. \nCOMMERCIAL V.0. (CONT'D) Virtual Self Industries. ON TV - The LOGO for VSI comes on the screen. \nCOMMERCIAL V.0. (CONT'D) Do what you want. Be what you want. \nCUT TO: \nINT. COLLEGE DORM - DAY \nA wood-paneled hallway of an Ivy League dorm, TWO MALE UNDERGRADS (pimply, glasses, overweight, clearly not surries) KNOCK on a dorm room door. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nUNDERGRAD #1 Yo, Canter! \nUNDERGRAD #2 Maybe he's still hung over. \nUNDERGRAD #1 He's gonna miss the exam. They try the door-- unlocked. \nINT. DORM ROOM - DAY \nAs soon as they enter, the UNDERGRADS choke on the stench, covering their noses. \nUNDERGRAD #1 Aw, Jesus... IN THE BED is a YOUNG MALE CORPSE, a SENSORY PROJECTOR attached to his head, the RED GLOW. OVERHEAD LIGHTS flick on to reveal goopy BLOOD at his nose and ears, the pillow soaked. \nGREER (V.0.) Tuxedo's operator turned up, student at Yale name of Anthony Canter... \nCUT TO: \nINT. FBI BUILDING/GREER'S OFFICE - DAY \nCluttered with papers, two desks. GREER sits before a TERMINAL, staring at his screen. \nGREER They're uploading his memory file. Seems we're dealing with an actual homicide. PETERS, at the other (much neater) desk, leans in to look over Greer's shoulder while the file uploads. \nPETERS You sound pleased. \nGREER Well, you get a little tired of property crime, vandalism-- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPETERS Thought you took your job seriously. Surrogates are extensions of people's selves-- \nGREER What are you, quoting VSI? \nPETERS The Supreme Court. ANTHONY STONE, Greer's BOSS, has entered Greer's office during the above. He's silver-haired, friendly, in perfect shape-- another surrogate. He's clearly heard this argument before. \nPETERS (CONT'D) Synthetic units have the same rights as biologicals. \nGREER Yeah, yeah. Fact is, most of the people you refer to as Dreads are just too poor to afford a synth. You think they like living on reservations? \nPETERS That's humanist propaganda. The restricted areas were their idea, they hate being around surries. \nSTONE Get a room, you two. He leans between them, hits a button on Greer's computer. ON SCREEN - A NEW HAVEN PD LOGO at the top of the screen, indicating this is an EVIDENCE FILE. In a large WINDOW, TUXEDO'S POV RECORDING plays. We now see the foreplay in the alley from the other perspective. FOOTSTEPS, Tuxedo pulls away from the BLONDE-- --and turns to confront THE HELMETED ASSASSIN. TUXEDO's \nVOICE: - \nTUXEDO (O.S.) Get lost, meatbag. THE ASSASSIN narrows his eyes-- then WHITE LIGHT fills the screen, the BLONDE'S SCREAM CUTS OUT as the audio goes. Then STATIC and BLACKNESS. GREER, PETERS and STONE react to this. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nGREER Poor kid. Pathologist said his brains looked like soup. \nPETERS \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCANTER That's right. You're with the FBI. \nPETERS Yes we are. He leads them into-- \nINT. CANTER'S PENTHOUSE/STUDY - DAY \nA traditional study, wood paneling, books. WINDOWS lead to a BALCONY. ARMANDO remains IN BG throughout scene. \nPETERS We're very sorry for your loss, sir. \nCANTER What progress have you made with the investigation? \nGREER I can't help noticing, your surrogate-- it's very similar to the unit your son was using... Canter pauses, then moves to a DOOR and opens it.- LIGHTS INSIDE FLICKER ON, revealing-- --a WALK-IN CLOSET with a half-dozen CHARGING BAYS. Four surrogates here, all versions of the man we've just seen-- Canter at different stages of life, from youth to almost elderly. Two of the charging bays are empty. \nCANTER I allowed Tony to borrow one of my surrogates when he wanted to spend time in D.C. I encouraged him to take advantage of the cultural \nOFFERINGS-- \nPETERS Wait, how is that possible? Aren't your surries locked to your neural signature? \nCANTER (closing the door) I wrote the code that remains at the core of all surrogates. It wasn't difficult for me to make my synth units accessible to my son. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGREER - Like getting the keys to dad's car. \nCANTER I suppose... \n(BEAT) The coroner says that Tony was online when it happened. Why hasn't the surrogate been returned to me? \nPETERS We're still analyzing the damage-- \nCANTER It was attacked? \nPETERS We really can't get into the details of an ongoing investigation-- \nGREER Dr. Canter-- we don't know of any way to kill an operator remotely. Do you? \nCANTER No, but-- at the beginning, all of us at VSI were worried about it. It's why every surrogate has a built-in fail-safe, they disconnect before they can transmit a potentially dangerous signal. \nPETERS Can you think of anyone who might want to harm your son? \nCANTER I... the sad fact is, Tony and I were just getting to know each other... he grew up with his mother in California. Canter's voice drifts off, he's starting to look far away, pained. He sits slowly behind his desk. \nCANTER (CONT'D) If this wasn't an accident... then it's because of me that he's... \n(BEAT) I'm sorry. You'll have to excuse me. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) Before Greer and Peters can reply, Canter goes rigid, eyes blank-- he's disconnected. \nGREER Guess the interview's over. \nPETERS \n(QUIETLY) Can you imagine what it's like to lose your only child? Greer scribbles something on a BUSINESS CARD. \nGREER Not really. You got kids? \nPETERS (shakes her head) Jim and I talked about it, but... \nGREER Lot of that going around. He starts to place the card on the desk before the immobile Canter. Armando steps forward warily-- Greer shows him the card before putting it down. \nGREER (CONT'D) If he thinks of anything else. \nWELCH Really. Do give him my regards-- The MALE LAWYER cuts him off, leaning across the table to shake hands. \nMALE LAWYER We're from the legal department. \nFEMALE LAWYER Hope you don't mind if we sit in. \nPETERS Not at all. I didn't get your names--? \nWELCH \n(OVER HER) You might be interested in a free software upgrade we're offering to all law enforcement officials, better night vision for your synth unit, improved pursuit capability... \nGREER Mm. Any idea what could cause a surrogate's head to explode from the inside? On the table, in a plastic EVIDENCE BAG, is a fried CIRCUIT-BOARD along with a pair of SHATTERED EYEBALLS. Greer passes this to Welch, who barely looks at it. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMALE LAWYER Mr. Welch isn't qualified to answer that question. You'd be better off speaking to one of our technicians. WELCH smiles pleasantly. \nFEMALE LAWYER What does the operator say? \nGREER Not much. He's dead. \nPETERS A massive brain hemmorhage, it happened while he was online. \nFEMALE LAWYER I'm sorry to hear that. But I can assure you it has nothing to do with VSI products. If a man suffers a heart attack while driving, he doesn't have a case against the automobile manufacturer. WELCH nods in agreement. GREER gamely continues to address his questions to the VP. \nGREER No one's talking lawsuit. we'd just like to know, is there any precedent for an operator being killed by signals from his synth unit? \nMALE LAWYER \n(ALMOST INDIGNANT) \nNONE WHATSOEVER-- \nFEMALE LAWYER The idea is absurd. If it were possible, it would defeat the purpose of surrogacy. \nMALE LAWYER Surries have jumped from bridges, been shot or blown to bits without the least harm to the operators- the fail-safes always kick in. Every case that's been brought against VSI has been shown to be the result of user negligence. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nFEMALE LAWYER We can't help it if customers forget to eat, sleep or take their medicine. WELCH shrugs and rises, followed by the lawyers. \nWELCH If that's all... a pleasure talking with you. \nGREER There is one more thing. The victim was Anthony Canter. The son of one of your company's founders. GREER studies them as they process this news. \nGREER (CONT'D) Kind of a strange coincidence. \nWELCH Dr. Canter has retired, but we'll be sure to send our condolences. \nEXT. VSI HEADQUARTERS - DAY \nGREER and PETERS move from a glass corporate tower, across beautifully manicured gardens. GREER carries the evidence in a briefcase. \nPETERS What's our take-away? \nGREER \n(SHRUGS) I used to be able to read people, back when they were people... \nPETERS You mean before they all became lawyers? \nGREER \n(A SMILE) You made a joke. Maybe there's hope for you, Peters... They head for a MANUFACTURING COMPLEX. \nINT. VSI FACTORY - DAY \nBRANDON Yeah, I'll be right over. He CLAPS a CAPTAIN on the shoulder as he moves out. \nBRANDON (CONT'D) Keep an eye on Bravo company. \nCAPTAIN We will kick some ass, sir. \nEXT. MARINE BASE - DAY \nHANGARS, boxy buildings, HUMVEES, SOLDIERS marching in formation. BRANDON walks with GREER and PETERS. \nBRANDON The United States has the largest surrogate army in.the world. Why on earth would the defense department want to develop a weapon that could wipe out our own troops? \nGREER So no such thing exists? \nBRANDON If it did, I'd know about it. \nPETERS Those soldiers we saw-- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBRANDON (a bit impatient) We routinely remove motherboards and optics for analysis. Now if you'll excuse me, we're in the middle of a peacekeeping operation. They've reached their car. Brandon turns on his heel and heads back for a hangar. Greer and Peters look after him for a moment. \nPETERS Think he's telling the truth? \nGREER Not when his lips are moving. Greer shakes his head as they both get in the car. WITH BRANDON - Out of earshot of the feds, he speaks into a small earpiece. \nBRANDON Bill, we may have a problem. Is it possible one of our ODs is loose? \nCUT TO: \nINT. FBI BUILDING/GREER'S OFFICE - DAY \nCANTER'S IMAGE on a COMPUTER SCREEN. It's his surrogate face, seated at his desk. This is a video-phone connection. \nCANTER Tell me, have you made any progress whatsoever? REVERSE ANGLE, Greer and Peters sit before the screen. \nBY ROTE: \nGREER Sir, we are not at liberty to comment on an ongoing investigation. \nCANTER Don't blow me off like I'm some goddamn reporter. I have resources of my own, do I have to do your jobs for you? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: GREER bites back his anger, rises and moves away from the screen before he says something he'll regret. He sits at ANOTHER TERMINAL, returns to work. Peters takes his place, attempting to sound reassuring. \nPETERS We're exploring every avenue, Dr. Canter, I promise you that, we're doing everything we can. CLOSE ON GREER'S TERMINAL - An INSET of the image of the ASSASSIN'S FACE, no helmet on-- it's much clearer than the one we saw before, this being the bouncer's perspective at the door of the club. We hear CANTER and PETERS continue in BG. \nCANTER What. What are you doing? \nPETERS I understand you're grieving-- \nCANTER I'm a target for assassination! I assume you're at least aware of that. WITH PETERS, she looks briefly over her shoulder at Greer with a \"help, get me out of this\" expression. He remains focussed on the image of the assassin, she turns back to Canter on the screen, maintaining her placating tone. \nPETERS I appreciate your concern and frustration, obviously we all want immediate results, but-- \nCANTER I've heard enough of your condescending pap. The people who did this are going to be punished. CANTER DISCONNECTS, his angry face VANISHES. PETERS rises and moves quickly toward Greer. \nGREER You handled that well. \nPETERS (points at screen) Where'd you get this? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nGREER The freak who was working the door at the club. Got a look at our perp dead-on. ON SCREEN - The Assassin's features HIGHLIGHT, the words \n\"756 PARTIAL MATCHES.\" REVERSE ANGLE -- GREER types, PETERS watches. \nEXT. BALTIMORE SLUMS - DAY \nWITH STRICKLAND, finishing his cell call. \nSTRICKLAND .maybe I'm not done with the O.D. Maybe you're not gonna get it back at all. Guy could have a lot of fun with your little toy... oh you can do better than that. I'll be in touch... He tosses the cellphone in a trashcan, pulls on his helmet, STARTS the bike and peels out. \nEXT. BALTIMORE - DAY \nAERIAL SHOT - CAMERA tracking over the CHESAPEAKE BAY and into the city, late afternoon. A small black CHOPPER with doorless openings on either side ENTERS FRAME. \nINT. HELICOPTER - DAY \nGREER is beside a PILOT, a handsome Hispanic surrie named LOPEZ. Greer shouts over the BLADE ROAR: \nGREER We're close! Noise suppression! LOPEZ nods, hits a couple of switches. THE LOUD THROB becomes a barely audible WHIRR. We hear PETERS' VOICE over the radio: \nPETERS (FILTER) Got a hit on the bike, half a mile from the rez, check your screen. ON THE CHOPPER DASH, A GPS DISPLAY of the nearby neighborhood, a BLINKING DOT a short distance away. \nPETERS (FILTER) (CONT'D) Baltimore PD's sending back-up. You can't fly over Dread territory, you know. We don't \nHAVE JURISDICTION-- Greer clicks off the radio, turns to Lopez. \nGREER Ignore her, Lopez. Get us as close as you can. LOPEZ grins--and pushes the stick hard-- \nEXT. BALTIMORE - DAY \nTHE CHOPPER banks and swoops almost silently. \nTNT. FBI BUILDING/SURVEILLANCE CENTER - DAY BOBBY glances over at PETERS as she monitors a GPS SCREEN and various INSET VIDEO FEEDS. He continues to work as he flirts with her. \nBOBBY You really look like your surrie? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: PETERS throws him a glare, turns back to her work. \nBOBBY (CONT'D) Don't be so touchy. I'm engaged to B-47 down there. He points to one of the many identical female DRONES buzzing along the tracks. PETERS smiles. \nEXT. BALTIMORE SLUMS - DUSK \nSTRICKLAND moves briskly on his BIKE. He glances in his MIRROR and sees-- --a couple of SQUAD CARS catching up with him. He hits the THROTTLE. ANOTHER COP CAR roars around the corner ahead of him, SQUAWKS the SIREN. STRICKLAND changes direction, veers into a narrow alley. \nINT. HELICOPTER - DUSK \nLOPEZ and GREER are directly overhead, watching STRICKLAND maneuver his bike quickly into the alley. \nEXT. SLUM ALLEY - DUSK \nThe alley is a DEAD END, a FENCE blocking the exit. STRICKLAND skids the bike into a CRASHING STOP, knocking over piles of GARBAGE. A SQUAD CAR barely clears the walls on either side, pursuing. It stops at a narrowing space, cops squeeze out either door, aiming GUNS. \nCOP Freeze! STRICKLAND stumbles away from his bike, into an alcove. The cops approach, guns ready. STRICKLAND yanks off his helmet, pulls his ominous DEVICE from his pocket. Without poking his head out, he aims it in the cops direction. He PRESSES A BUTTON. A row of RED DIODES GLOW on the device as he sweeps it across the alley, but it emits no projectiles and makes no sound. COP #1 is closer-- his GLASS EYES SHATTER. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: COP #2 drops his weapon, staggers backward and falls, clutching his head. \nINT. HELICOPTER - DUSK \nGREER has seen this, horrified. \nGREER Jesus, what is that? STRICKLAND is on the run again, scaling the fence. He hasn't spotted the chopper. GREER looks in the direction he's heading-- A HUGE CHAIN-LINK FENCE, topped with barbed wire, stretching across the whole city, just a hundred yards away. PORTRAITS of the PROPHET (the man we heard on the radio), long-haired and bearded, adorn the fence. There's a GATE, with two GUARDS checking those entering, one or two people are waiting. \nGREER (CONT'D) He gets through the gate, we can't touch him. GREER readies a RIFLE with a SCOPE, loads a TRANQUILIZER DART into the chamber. LOPEZ maneuvers to give Greer an angle out the chopper's side. \nEXT. SLUM ALLEY - DUSK \nSTRICKLAND looks up to see GREER taking aim from the silent chopper. He leaps for cover behind a dumpster as-- GREER FIRES a DART, which RICOCHETS off the DUMPSTER. STRICKLAND scrambles around a corner. \nINT. HELICOPTER - DUSK \nLOPEZ turns the bird forward to pursue, as GREER reloads. They round the corner. No sign of Strickland on the pavement. GREER looks to his left, beyond the PILOT-- STRICKLAND has scaled a fire escape, aiming the DEVICE right at Lopez. Greer sees what's about to happen-- \nGREER Please, I need your help... open the door! CAMERA MOVES through the RED-LIT room, to show the WIRES of a SENSORY PROJECTOR, a partial view of MAGGIE'S HEAD. \nINT. GREER'S APARTMENT/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nMAGGIE (her surrogate), in a tailored business suit, enters the apartment with BRIDGET, another gorgeous, high- fashion surrie in party clothes. They're laughing. \nBRIDGET --we're talking turquoise! I wouldn't carry a purse that color, much less a whole new skin. \nMAGGIE BRB, I just gotta change. Little black dress or red bustier? \nBRIDGET Bustier. \nINT. GREER'S APARTMENT/HALLWAY - NIGHT \nMAGGIE almost trips over GREER, unconscious on the floor. \nMAGGIE Oh my God. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT \nSTART ON a MAILBOX with the name \"PETERS,\" as CARLIGHTS catch it. As the CAR turns up the dirt road in this rural area in the Rockies, it flips its LIGHTS OFF. \nINT. PETERS' HOUSE - NIGHT \nA pleasant, rustic home. JENNIFER PETERS, somewhat less perfect than her surrie, disconnects from her SENSORY PROJECTOR. She looks concerned, very tired. She rises from her stim chair and moves into a kitchen. PULL BACK - we're watching her through a WINDOW, with a very large and powerful-looking STALKER, LATER - PETERS in bed, fast asleep. A SHADOW crosses her doorway, but moves on. AT HER sensory PROJECTOR, the STALKER is SCANNING through her hard-drive's memory. ON SCREEN - fast-forwarding rapidly through PETERS' POV, we see GREER in the alley with the fallen SURRIES... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: THE STALKER, face illuminated by the screen's GLOW, looks expressionlessly toward Peters' bedroom, then back to the images. His eyes have a silvery, inhuman sheen. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. STRICKLAND'S APARTMENT - DAY \nEarly morning. STRICKLAND sleeps fitfully in this gloomy, dingy space. He comes to, startles at the sight \nOF-- --a MAN sitting at the foot of his bed. He's very tall, imposing, bearded, dressed in black-- this is the PROPHET. Strickland is cowed, this isn't a man you get a lot of face time with. \nPROPHET You've been keeping secrets, Jack. TWO LARGE MEN now move into view, flanking the Prophet. Call them BUD and MILLER. They're scruffy, bearded, not surries. \nSTRICKLAND No, Prophet, I--- \nPROPHET This is unfair to your brother humans. STRICKLAND tries to get out of bed, Bud pushes him down. \nSTRICKLAND Please, I haven't done anything... \nPROPHET I know what you've done. What I don't know is-- who hired you to betray us? I want a name. \nSTRICKLAND I-- I swear to God I don't know-- \nPROPHET Jack... \nSTRICKLAND He never said his name, we talked on disposable cellphones-- I've never even seen his face! I couldn't tell you who he was if my life depended it! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: On the Prophet's disappointed, even sad expression... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY \nCLOSE ON A MEDICAL MONITOR - high-tech imaging of a HUMAN \nBRAIN. MOVE DOWN to find GREER (the real one), asleep. An IV, BLEEPING monitors. Uneaten LUNCH on a tray. MAGGIE, her surrogate that is, sits in a chair beside the bed, her hand resting on GREER's. He stirs-- she pulls her hand back, returns to her fashion magazine. A TV plays above his bed, Greer blinks, squints at this. ON TV - a small BOY CLIMBS a very tall TREE above a suburban sidewalk, pleasant MUSIC. Suddenly, a BRANCH BREAKS, the boy tumbles with a CRY. GREER winces distastefully. ON TV - now we see the BOY again, perfectly fine, standing beside his mother. She strokes his head with a smile. They look down at his broken SURROGATE on the ground beside the fallen BRANCH. \nCOMMERCIAL V.0. Imagine a world where children are safe. Always... GREER, watching the screen, addresses Maggie. \nGREER Would you do that? \nAGAINST-- \nGREER None of us did! We still don't know. I don't think Strickland even knew-- he thought he was just taking down \"the abominations.\" \nSTONE I'm sorry, Greer,. but- - you're suspended, pending further action. Greer nods slowly, knew this was coming. PETERS takes a step back, looking on carefully. Greer takes his LAPTOP COMPUTER off the bedside table, opens it so that Stone can see it. \nGREER I've been going through my memory files of the crash... ever seen anything like this before? ON SCREEN - a magnified CLOSE-UP of the DEVICE in STRICKLAND'S HAND, as he points it upward at the helicopter. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (4) \nPETERS It's the murder weapon? GREER nods, STONE studies the laptop, sets his jaw. \nSTONE It's more than that. It means nobody is safe. The Dreads want us all to be like them-- living in fear, no better than animals. And we've only just freed ourselves, begun to explore our true potential. \nGREER We need to get this guy. \nSTONE We will. Our way of life will be protected, whatever it takes. An attractive SURRIE NURSE enters the room. \nNURSE Good news, Mr. Greer. The doctors say you can go home today. \nGREER (nervous, thrown) They said the end of the week-- \nNURSE Insurance, you know. She smiles, putting his clothing by the bed and disconnecting him from the IV and monitors. \nSTONE Just take some time to heal. \nGREER What about my surrogate? \nSTONE Hasn't been-recovered. I'm afraid we can't supply you with a new one until this matter is resolved. Peters, make sure he gets home in one piece. PETERS nods, looking at Greer sympathetically. GREER sinks back into his pillow, anxious. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (5) ON MEDICAL MONITOR - the image of GREER'S BRAIN shuts OFF with a BLIP. \nEXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE - DAY \nPETERS strides from the doors, GREER follows, dressed in casual clothes... then slows his pace, breathing hard. GREER'S POV - CARS zipping past on the street, RUSHING PEDESTRIANS, PARAMEDICS pushing a body past on a gurney. From Greer's now human perspective, surrogates seem artificial, appearance too perfect, eyes empty of souls. This should be reeling, vertiginous. PETERS pauses, seeing Greer is having a panic attack. He has trouble speaking. \nGREER I haven't been out without a surrogate in a long time... \nPETERS It's OK. Nothing's gonna happen. \nGREER They wanted to give me something for the anxiety... they call it corporeaphobia. \nPETERS Just take my arm. He shakes his head, takes a deep breath and moves out onto the sidewalk. Peters stays close. GREER'S POV - SURRIE PEDESTRIANS, moving quickly, seeming to come right. at him. One bumps into him-- GREER staggers, the surrie moves on as if he hasn't even noticed. Greer moves toward the curb to get away from them, stumbles-- PETERS has to pull him out of CAR TRAFFIC, a HORN HONKS. He's sweating, terrified. \nGREER Jesus Christ. \nPETERS We need to get you a replacement. She takes his arm forcibly and moves him away. \nEXT. SURROGATE DISCOUNT STORE - DAY \nA low-end place, BODIES displayed in the windows in their charging bays, SIGNS reading \"HURRY 4 A SURRY! GIANT \nSALE! SYNTH UNITS NEW & USED!\" PETERS guides GREER inside. \nINT. SURROGATE DISCOUNT STORE - DAY \nCOFFIN-SIZED BOXES, SENSORY PROJECTORS and STIM CHAIRS stacked willy-nilly. BRIGHT LIGHTS, VIDEO SCREENS running PROMOS. A slick, blond Aryan SALESMAN approaches with a grin. He sizes GREER up, instantly recognizing signs of withdrawal. He speaks with an incongruous ASIAN \nACCENT. \nSALESMAN Oh you poor guy-- out in just your skin can be scary. No worries, I got perfect surrie for you. He leads them deeper into the store. He wears a clip-on ID BADGE with the smiling face of a dark-haired ASIAN. RACKS OF ATTRACTIVE MALE and FEMALE BODIES, in skimpy BATHING SUITS-- differing heights and degrees of muscle. GREER looks these over. \nGREER I like to see my own face when I look in the mirror. \nSALESMAN Fine, you no buy off the rack-- we customize, on premise, less than one hour. As they move on, we glimpse CELEBRITY LOOK-ALIKES on the rack-- MARILYN MONROE and ELVIS PRESLEY. LATER - ON COMPUTER SCREEN, a 3-D RENDERING of GREER'S FACE rotates, shows EXPRESSIONS, smiles, frowns-- and speaks. A VOICE-PRINT runs below. \nGREER'S VOICE Hello. Testing-one-two-three... THE SALESMAN works the computer, GREER lies in an uncomfortable STIM CHAIR attached to a_SENSORY PROJECTOR, RED GOGGLES over his eyes and a CAMERA pointed at his face. He seems uneasy. PETERS looks on from nearby. \nMILLER (CONT'D) Hurts, doesn't it. \nBUD It's a bitch being real. GREER lets out a primal CRY and lunges at MILLER, driving his head into the man's torso, knocking the wind out of him before the other two can pull Greer back. \nADAMS I think he likes it. \nMILLER (catching his breath) So give him some more. Outnumbered three to one, Greer takes a beating, continues to throw mostly ineffective punches that just cause the men to redouble their efforts. Finally, he's limp in their arms. Miller plucks Greer's WALLET and BADGE from his pockets, examines them. As he does so, GREER spits BLOOD on the man's face. Miller seems about to whomp him again, but stops himself. \nMILLER (CONT'D) Not gonna give you the satisfaction. (to Bud and Adams) Get him out of here. Miller tosses Greer's ID at him, then moves toward the RV, leaving GREER gasping in the clutches of Bud and Adams, lit by the FLAMES from the funeral pyre. \nINT. PROPHET'S RV - NIGHT \nA spartan interior. MILLER enters. THE PROPHET stands with a couple of HANDLERS. \nHANDLER Trouble? \nMILLER Some fed named Greer, he wanted to talk to the Prophet. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHANDLER About that turkey shoot in DC? \nMILLER Didn't come up. Said they wanted Strickland's weapon. \nPROPHET Well, maybe I'll just have to bring it to their doorstep... In the Prophet's hand, we now see-- --the mysterious DEVICE with which Strickland killed his targets. \nEXT. RESERVATION NO MAN'S LAND - NIGHT \nGREER is half-dragged, half-carried, back the way he came, flanked by BUD and ADAMS. Greer sucks on his BLEEDING lip, works his tongue around in his mouth. He touches parts of his bruised body carefully. \nBUD Guy like you oughtn't be out in just your skin. \nGREER I'm starting to see your point. AT THE GATE - GREER leaves, trying to muster as much dignity as he can. The DREAD GUARD calls sarcastically after him. \nDREAD GUARD Come again real soon! \nEXT. BALTIMORE SLUMS - NIGHT \nGREER trudges along the seedy streets. He looks a mess-- torn clothing, bloodstains, bruises. Suddenly he's SHOVED from behind, falls to the pavement. \nWHEELS Oops. The assailant is a FREAK SURRIE-- extra ARMS, WHEELS where his feet should be. A moment later, Greer is surrounded by three rich, FREAKY \nTEENS. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: They've customized their surries in completely bizarre ways, in addition to the usual tattoos and piercings. Besides WHEELS, there's a hairless teen with six EYES scattered around his head. A GIRL has SPIKES sticking out of her skull and flesh and REPTILE SKIN. \nEYES Watch where you're going, meat. \nSPIKES What are you doin' off the rez? She bumps against GREER as he picks himself up, he shrinks from the spikes. She shoots a small blast of FLAME from her nostrils, then GIGGLES. \nGREER I'm not a Dread. \nWHEELS Then you oughta return that surrie, looks like shit. WHEELS comes at Greer again, Greer moves and TRIPS him-- but he just lands on an extra arm and rights himself. \nEYES Hey, it wants to play. EYES lowers his head and moves to butt him. GREER dodges, it looks like a bullfight. \nSPIKES Ole, toro! They turn, hearing a SCREECH OF TIRES. A LIMOUSINE has pulled up. A 10-year-old BOY climbs from the back and approaches. \nBOY Agent Greer. Would you like a ride? The kid's voice sounds like a child's, but with mature cadences to his speech. - \nWHEELS Check out Richie Rich. THE DRIVER of the Limo steps out-- it's ARMANDO from Canter's lobby. He lets his jacket fall open, revealing a HOLSTERED SIDEARM. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nARMANDO We got a problem here? The FREAKS retreat with dirty looks. \nTHE LIMO stops, a light RAIN now falling. GREER gets out and closes the door, the rear window rolls down. \nBOY/CANTER Somebody hired Strickland. You'll know who that is when you trace the weapon. \nGREER You really don't need to do my job for me. Boy/Canter takes in Greer's disheveled state. \nBOY/CANTER Yes, I can see you've got things under control. The limo pulls away. Greer pauses, looks up at the sky, letting the rain wash over his face. \nINT. GREER'S APARTMENT/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nAN ELECTRICAL ARC jumps from a GLASS TUBE to a MALE \nNOSTRIL. WIDER, the guy taking the jolt is a lanky male model named BRIAN. His face goes slack. ATMOSPHERIC MUSIC \nPLAYS. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: MAGGIE and BRIDGET are squeezed together on the couch in Greer's apartment with BRIAN and a French hunk named ANDRE, who speaks with a slight ACCENT. Everyone is pretty high. Andre closes one eye, then the other, pupils turned inward. \nANDRE Think my nose is too big... \nMAGGIE For what? \nANDRE \n(SQUEEZING IT) I'm going to have it replaced. \nBRIDGET While you're at it-- I am so sick of twelve-inch dicks. MAGGIE chuckles. On the coffee table before them sits a small JACKER, like the one we saw in the underground club. The foursome pass a single ELECTRICAL TUBE around, attached by a cord to the device. Andre and Bridget have clearly coupled up, Brian touches Maggie's leg casually from time to time. \nANDRE What do you want, we're men. \nBRIAN (coming out of it) Why is that? Why do we all have to be men and women? I'd rather be-- I dunno, a lion. Or an eagle. \nMAGGIE Mm. A spaceship. Or a cloud. \nBRIAN \n(BEAT) A cloud? Maggie shrugs. She lifts the hair from the nape of her neck, moves the GLASS TUBE there. Brian holds her close. The ELECTRICAL ARC-- MAGGIE gasps with pleasure, transported. A moment later, Andre notices that GREER has entered quietly during the above, staring at the foursome. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nANDRE Don't look now. Some homeless meatbag just wandered in. Maggie has blanked out for the moment. Bridget turns. \nBRIDGET That's Maggie's husband. Hi Tom. She gives him a little wave. Greer moves past them, toward the kitchen, and disappears. Maggie comes out of her trance, blinks and sighs. \nMAGGIE Excuse me. She hurries after him. Brian shrugs, grabs the tube and starts to unzip his pants-- \nINT. GREER'S APARTMENT/KITCHEN - NIGHT \nGREER has removed an old, yellowed FIRST-AID KIT from under the sink, during the scene he cleans up cuts, opens his shirt to check his bruised ribs, etc. \nMAGGIE What happened to you? I thought you were-spending another night in the hospital. \nGREER Obviously. You know I don't like you jacking in the house. He finds an untouched, dusty bottle of SCOTCH, sniffs it and pours a drink. Maggie looks him over. \nMAGGIE Somebody beat you up? How could you go out like that? As Maggie speaks, she moves to his side, touching his injuries gently, truly concerned. Greer flinches back. \nMAGGIE (CONT'D) What were you thinking, Tom? You. could've been killed. \nGREER Just finding out how the other half lives. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Greer takes a long drink, gestures toward the living room. \nGREER (CONT'D) So what's his name? \nMAGGIE Oh please, grow up. \nBRANDON At the flick of a switch. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BEAUTY SHOP - DAY \nCLOSE on a WOMAN'S FACE being carefully peeled off the MECHANICAL UNDERPINNINGS. FUNKY MUSIC plays. WIDER, BRIDGET leans over the body, putting the old face aside. A row of EXOTIC NEW FACES on a rack nearby. Bridget begins manipulating the underlying musculature, changing cheekbones, etc, using delicate TOOLS. \nBRIDGET She wanted blue eyes the size of golf balls, bee-sting lips and a tiny ski-jump nose... \nMAGGIE Boop-oop-a-doop. \nBRIDGET Exactly. Nearby, MAGGIE works on a brown-skinned HAND. She stares through a mounted MAGNIFYING LOUPE, embedding tiny JEWELS in the SKIN of the fingers. She uses TWEEZERS and a tiny BLOWTORCH. After a moment, we realize the HAND has been disconnected from the body, mounted on a brace. \nMAGGIE You talked her down, I hope. \nBRIDGET Yes, thank God, we're doing a modified Audrey Hepburn. MAGGIE glances over at Bridget's work admiringly. \nMAGGIE I'd love you to raise my cheekbones a half-inch, but Tom would go ballistic. THE DOOR CHIMES, Bridget looks up. \nBRIDGET Speaking of the ball and chain... As GREER approaches, a few of the BEAUTY ENGINEERS glance up, then return to their business. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: This place is a cross between a beautician's and an auto body repair shop. SURRIES in chairs that maneuver into all kinds of positions. Not only are they having nails and hair done, but legs lengthened, breasts enlarged, etc. (Operators check in their bodies and leave them there for modifications.) \nBRIDGET (CONT'D) Hiya, Tom. \nMAGGIE I didn't hear you come home last night. \nGREER Worked late. I'd really like to sit down and talk with you. \nMAGGIE I can take a break-- \nGREER No, Maggie, face to face. The two of us, for real. BRIDGET is getting uncomfortable. \nBRIDGET These smile muscles need to set. She exits with a look at Maggie. Maggie stops working and turns to Greer, speaks passionately. \nMAGGIE Tom, don't you get it? That body in our apartment-- the one you call real--- it isn't me. I'm right here. \nGREER Honey, if you're worried about the way you look-- it doesn't matter, it never did-- \nMAGGIE Exactly! What matters is who I choose to be. As the conversation gets more heated, co-workers pointedly turn away, while eavesdropping. \nGREER I married a person, you're choosing to be a thing. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nGREER (CONT'D) And I'm so sick of being surrounded by things-- young, beautiful things. \nMAGGIE Well that's your problem, isn't it. if you can be young and beautiful and feel good all the time-- why would anyone choose anything else? \nGREER Because it's bullshit. Because we're human, like it or not. \nMAGGIE Jesus, Tom. You sound like a Dread. Maggie turns back to what she was doing. Greer has trouble swallowing his anger. \nGREER I may just have to kick down your bedroom door. \nMAGGIE (not looking up) I'd never forgive you. \nGREER Then maybe I should just move out. \nMAGGIE Do what you want... \nGREER \n(A BEAT) That's a commercial. Greer turns and exits. Maggie glances after him with a mixture of anger and regret, then returns to her work. \nGREER Guy at VSI. You looking forward to moving to the private sector--? Nakata is listening curiously. Stone angrily gestures for Greer to come into his office, he doesn't want to have this conversation in public. Greer keeps speaking as he heads inside. \nGREER (CONT'D) Will you finish out the year? We're sure gonna miss you around here... STONE SLAMS the door. \nINT. FBI BUILDING/STONE'S OFFICE - DAY \nGreer keeps speaking calmly, as if there were no tension in the air. \nGREER I know it's hard to resist, better hours, better pay-- \nSTONE Welch told you about this? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGREER (beat, grins) No. I was just fishing. \nSTONE You've suffered brain damage, Greer. Let's hope it isn't permanent. \nGREER \n(GRIN FADING) All surveillance on the Prophet goes through this office. Jack Strickland was one of your stoolies. Why the hell didn't you say something? STONE just stares at him, narrowing his eyes. \nGREER (CONT'D) Two cops died. You knew he had the \n0. D.-- \nSTONE I have no idea what you're talking \nABOUT-- \nGREER --because you gave it to him. VSI makes them-- they hand one to you-- and you chose the trigger man. Your own little black op. If anyone looks, they blame the Dreads. But Strickland didn't follow the plan, did he? He didn't give you back the 0. D. like he was supposed to. \nSTONE Are you done with this paranoid fantasy--? \nGREER Not quite. What I can't figure out is why. Why kill Canter? STONE stares at Greer, angry and defiant. He moves to his desk, types into his COMPUTER. Greer approaches slowly. \nSTONE I'm issuing orders for your detention. Your mind isn't right, you've become a threat to national security. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) Greer slips a LETTER OPENER off of Stone's desk as he nears. His hand is SHAKING. Suddenly-- --STONE yanks open a DRAWER and lunges for a GUN. But before he can bring it to bear-- --GREER STABS him in the back of the head, SKEWERING STONE'S CPU. STONE FREEZES, hunched over his desk, gun in hand. Greer just stares at what he's done for a moment, amazed. Then he waves a hand in front of Stone's open eyes, makes sure he's out, and-- --carefully pries off a plate and removes STONE'S MOTHERBOARD, places it on the desk. GREER pulls the gun out of Stone's hand, rolls him back in front of his desk, propped up to face the computer. Greer crouches behind him, operating the keyboard by reaching around his boss' body. ON COMPUTER - Greer types in a request for a FILE on LIONEL CANTER. The words \"CLASSIFIED - IDENTITY SCAN REQUIRED\" appear. GREER pushes the chair a bit closer to the computer, ducking down, lifts Stone's head by the hair. The monitor momentarily displays STONE'S FACE. A LIGHT goes on in the corner of the FRAME, scanning Stone. \"AUTHORIZED USER\" appears. GREER peeks up again, continuing his work. ON SCREEN - a HEADSHOT OF CANTER, reams of CLASSIFIED INFO. Greer hits PRINT. \nINT. FBI BUILDING/BULLPEN - DAY \nGREER emerges, a stack of PAPERS in his hand. He gives a nod to NAKATA, who nods back as he answers his RINGING PHONE. Before he can even say a word: \nSTONE (FILTER) This is Stone! Nakata looks toward the office, starting to rise. \nNAKATA What do you need, sir? \nINT. STONE'S STUDY - DAY \nUpscale. The REAL STONE, a good deal heavier than his surrogate, is sitting in boxer shorts at the edge of his STIM CHAIR, a phone in his hand. \nSTONE Sonofabitch Greer disabled my surrie, stop him! \nINT. FBI BUILDING/STAIRWELL - DAY \nGREER takes a couple steps at a time. He's on his phone. \nGREER Just meet me in the garage-- leave the trunk open! As he rounds a corner, he comes face to face with-- --a pair of AGENTS, each carrying a HANDGUN. They approach from below. \nAGENT #1 Tom, we don't want to hurt you. Greer nods and raises his hands, resigned-- he still clutches the papers. As Agent #1 nears, Greer suddenly-- --PLANTS a FOOT in the man's chest, sending him crashing into AGENT #2. Both men topple down the stairs, FIRE their guns wildly. Greer has also lost his balance and dropped some papers, which he has to scoop up as he claws for the. doorway and dashes through. \nINT. FBI BUILDING/PARKING GARAGE - DAY \nPETERS waits near an IDLING SEDAN, the TRUNK OPEN. Greer dives inside, she SLAMS it and gets behind the wheel. She PEELS out, going up a few levels. AT AN EXIT GATE - an FBI GUARD looks inside. \nFBI GUARD They're looking for Tom Greer. You seen him? She shakes her head, he presses a button to open the gate and waves her through. \nCONTINUED: (2) \nGREER Can't bring him back. \nPETERS \n(ENRAGED) They will come after Canter again-- but you're just going to deposit your pension checks, look the other way and let him die. \nGREER (looks at her) Maybe he's got it coming. \nPETERS \n(BETRAYED) I thought you were a cop. I thought you were a human being. PETERS marches out of there and slams the door on the way out. GREER waits a few moments, his mind racing-- then he moves for the door himself. \nINT. RENTAL AGENCY - DAY \nGREER moves from a desk with a pretty RENTAL AGENT, working at a small hand-held COMPUTER. LOGOS for GLOBAL \nSYNTH RENTALS. \nRENTAL AGENT Our nearest rental office is just outside Denver, the car and phone will be extra-- \nGREER I'm only gonna be there a couple hours. She leads him toward a curtained BOOTH, one of many here. RED GLOWS emanate from a few. \nRENTAL AGENT Do you want to customize--? \nGREER Generic's fine. She pulls back a CURTAIN to reveal a STIM-CHAIR and a \nSENSORY PROJECTOR. \nCUT TO: \nINT. RESERVATION TEMPLE -- DAY \nTHE PROPHET stands with a MIC before a LARGE CROWD packed into the place, sounds of CHAOS from outside. GUARDSMEN are moving into the temple, methodically searching those inside. - \nPROPHET Have no fear, the day of resurrection is at hand! A team of GUARDSMEN move to surround the Prophet, his BODYGUARDS struggle with them. \nPROPHET (CONT'D) No! Do not resist! The oppressors shall soon fall, never to rise again... Ignoring him, some bodyguards pull HANDGUNS and FIRE on the SURROGATE GUARDSMEN, who immediately RETURN FIRE with automatic weapons. BUD and MILLER, the Prophet's right hand men, both take bullets and go down. THE PROPHET manages to escape out a side exit during this gunfire-- but a stray BULLET catches him in the back as he flees. \nEXT. RESERVATION TEMPLE - DAY \nAs he runs from the building, the PROPHET is TACKLED by a GUARDSMAN. He turns the man over, the Prophet's eyes are empty, his head lolls back. A BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM from nearby as a YOUNG FEMALE DREAD takes this in. \nYOUNG DREAD They've killed him! They've killed the Prophet! Other DREADS nearby react, the CRY spreading. WITH THE GUARDSMAN, examining the body. The Prophet is already rigid... and GREEN COOLANT is spreading from an exit wound in his chest. A guardsman rips open his shirt, pokes at the wound-- ELECTRONICS and TORN PLASTIC. THE GUARDSMAN's amazed, gets on his WALKIE-TALKIE. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGUARDSMAN Captain, you'd better come see this. Nearby Guardsmen react to the furious DREADS massing around them. A GRENADE LANDS nearby, GUARDSMAN #2 throws himself on it, his SURRIE BLOWS UP. GUNFIRE ERUPTS nearby, a MOLOTOV COCKTAIL sails through the air. \nGUARDSMAN #3 We need to clear out! \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY \nLate in the afternoon. Rolling green hills, trees, a rural area. A white COMPACT CAR pulls up a dirt road, past the MAILBOX with \"PETERS\" painted on it. \nEXT. PETERS' HOUSE - DAY \nTHE COMPACT pulls to a stop. GENERIC/GREER climbs out of the car. He's blandly handsome, in a business suit, with perfect hair that looks glued in place. His movements are stilted, this is a cheap model and he's not used to it. GENERIC/GREER steps onto the porch, knocks on the door. No answer. He tries the knob-- locked. \nINT. RENTAL AGENCY/BOOTH - DAY \nMATCH-CUT POV of PETERS' DOOR on a SENSORY PROJECTOR \nSCREEN. REAL GREER in a rental stim-chair, bathed in RED LIGHT. His face twitches slightly, as if having a bad dream. \nEXT. PETERS' HOUSE - DAY \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nREAL PETERS (CONT'D) He took my memory-- the whole investigation. He said he was going to do my job for me. A beat. Their eyes meet as the realization hits Generic/Greer. \nGENERIC/GREER (under his breath) Canter. \nREAL PETERS It has to be... oh God, I'm so cold... She clearly had been fighting to stay alive, just to tell someone what happened. \nREAL PETERS (CONT'D) Would've been nice to meet you in person... She now closes her eyes. Greer agonizes. \nGENERIC/GREER Peters, hang on, please-- it won't be long... He rises, finds an old blanket to put around her. \nREAL PETERS Thirsty... \nINT. PETERS' KITCHEN - NIGHT \nGENERIC/GREER quickly fills a glass of water from the tap. He hears SIRENS in the distance as he hurries back into the basement. \nINT. PETERS' BASEMENT - NIGHT \nGENERIC/GREER kneels down to dribble water on REAL PETERS' partially open lips. We hear a VEHICLE ARRIVE outside. \nGENERIC/GREER They'll be here in just a minute... No response. He brushes her hair back from her face-- REAL PETERS' eyes are half-open, vacant. She's dead. GENERIC/GREER lets out an anguished CRY. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: ANGLE UP STAIRS - SURRIE PARAMEDICS rush down with a STRETCHER. They take in the sight of-- TWO MOTIONLESS BODIES. PETERS, dead... and l ass lass GENERIC/GREER, kneeling over her body, head bowed, g still in hand-- checked out. \nCUT TO: \nTNT. RENTAL AGENCY - DAY REAL GREER comes out of the curtained booth in a hurry, moving for the door. He's talking on the phone. \nGREER Who's on duty in surveillance--? Sanders, great, put me through-- He's pursued by the RENTAL AGENT. \nRENTAL AGENT Sir, sir, sir-- you haven't returned your unit-- Greer ignores the woman, he's out of there. She calls after him angrily. \nRENTAL AGENT (CONT'D) You signed a contract! \nEXT. WASHINGTON STREET - DAY \nA handful of DREADS are storming down the street, SMASHING WINDOWS and bowling over any SURRIES who get in their way. A SCROLLING ELECTRONIC NEWS CRAWL on the side of a building: \"PROPHET SHOT, REPORTED DEAD...\" GREER is walking fast, on the phone, steering clear of the angry Dreads. \nGREER It's an emergency, you need to connect me now! \nINT. FBI BUILDING/SURVEILLANCE CENTER - DAY \nTIGHT ON BOBBY, the overweight controller, at his station. He looks nervous, wearing his HEADSET. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Responding to a subtle BEEP in his ear,-he makes as if to scratch himself, opening the connection. We hear GREER'S \nFILTERED VOICE: \nGREER (FILTER) Bobby, it's Greer, I need a remote shutdown. You'll have the surrie's digital address on file, Agent Jennifer Peters. CAMERA MOVES to reveal that PETERS (the surrie) is holding BOBBY at GUNPOINT, a grim expression on her face. She doesn't realize Bobby's on the phone. \nGREER (FILTER) (CONT'D) Hello? Bobby, are you there? Bobby looks toward the special TERMINAL that displays the surrie serial numbers. NUMBERS are cranking through fast, ALL HIGHLIGHTING. Bobby looks at Peters, but speaks for Greer's benefit. \nBOBBY Peters, have you gone insane? Put the gun away, what the hell are you trying to prove? PETERS ignores him, watching the TERMINAL SCREEN. WIDER now, we see that all the SURRIE WATCHERS have disconnected, they're stationary on their tracks. THE GLOWING MONITORS remain on, showing random scenes, unwatched. MOVEMENT at the elevated entrance-- --PETERS spins and FIRES HER HANDGUN in that direction. The intruder retreats. We now see a couple of SURRIES have already been dropped here, sprawled on the staircase leading down, bullets in their heads. PETERS spins on Bobby, who's WHISPERING frantically into \nHIS HEADSET: \nBOBBY (CONT'D) She's into the entire surrie database, I dunno what she's-- Peters YANKS off Bobby's headset and throws it aside. \nEXT. WASHINGTON STREET - DAY \nGREER has stopped, stunned. Then, realizing what's happening, he takes off at a sprint in a different direction. He makes another call: \n(CONTINUED) \nSTONE We spend years trying to nail you for funding the Dreads-- and now you hand yourself over to us on a silver platter. Hijacking an agent, destroying federal property, creating a hostage situation... Peters pulls her gun and points it at BOBBY'S HEAD. He cowers in his chair. \nSTONE (CONT'D) I wouldn't add homicide to that list. As it is, you're going to prison for a very long time. He turns on his heel, begins walking back up the stairs for the door. PETERS lowers the gun, reaches into her pocket and pulls out the Q.D. WEAPON. \nPETERS An eye for an eye... She points it at the back of Stone's head and-- --STONE's eyes go wide in agony-- and EXPLODE. He goes TUMBLING back down the stairs, SMOKE pouring from his head, BODY twitching crazily. \nINT. LUXURY BUILDING/STAIRWELL - DAY \n--GREER is GASPING for breath as he reaches an upper landing. Ahead of him is a heavy STEEL DOOR with a KEYPAD LOCK. He tries the handle, kicks the door once, then pulls his gun and aims it at the lock, turning away as he SHOOTS. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: THE BULLET RICOCHETS about the narrow area, scaring the hell out of him. The LOCK is intact. \nGREER Damn it! He moves to a NARROWER STAIRCASE with a sign, \"ROOF \nACCESS.\" \nINT. FBI BUILDING/SURVEILLANCE CENTER - DAY \nThe RIOT AGENTS pour in now, GUNS FIRING. PETERS drops behind a bank of TERMINALS for cover. BULLETS rocket past, one CATCHES her in the arm, but barely phases her. THE RIOT AGENTS move in, military style, surrounding \nPETERS. PETERS fiddles with the O.D.-- CLOSE - she slides back a panel, hits a couple of tiny SWITCHES-- the RED DIODES go to BLUE. PETERS points the device over the terminal, sweeps it in \nAN ARC-- --the RIOT AGENTS all FREEZE'IN PLACE for a second-- and then drop at once. Unlike with Stone, there's no twitching, smoke or exploding eyeballs. The sudden silence is eerie. PETERS rises and moves to STONE, the grotesque, empty- eyed surrogate. Her expression is grim, but she's accomplished an important part of her mission. BOBBY looks around at the many fallen bodies. \nBOBBY Are they dead? \nPETERS (re: the riot agents) They're fine. \nINT. STONE'S STUDY - DAY \nThe PHONE IS RINGING. Move from it to-- STONE, in his stim chair, projector on his head... eyes rolled back, dead. BLOOD begins to seep from his ears. \nEXT. CANTER'S BUILDING/ROOF/BALCONY - DAY \nGREER has come out on the roof. There's an enormous CELL TOWER and DISH up here. He moves to the edge, peers over warily. ANGLE DOWN - forty stories down to the street. GREER flinches back, reeling with vertigo. He moves along the edge, looking for something. ANGLE DOWN - the BALCONY outside Canter's study, just inside the roof overhang, a fifteen-foot drop. GREER squeezes his eyes shut, steeling himself for what he must do. He lowers himself to hang onto the edge, trying not to look down. He swings his body to get the momentum going the right way-- --but his grip gives a moment too soon-- GREER plunges from the roof to the BALCONY RAIL, hitting the railing hard, starting to fall off the wrong way. But he manages to grab onto the metal. He hauls himself up and collapses onto the balcony, lying on his back. HIS LEG has been injured in the fall, the pants torn, blood. GREER breathes audibly, in pain and exhaustion. \nINT. FBI BUILDING/SURVEILLANCE CENTER - DAY \nON THE TERMINAL - numbers still HIGHLIGHTING, flying past at incredible speed. MOVE TO FIND PETERS, with an open TOOLBOX. She's expertly wiring the O.D. to the keyboard, cutting, splicing and reattaching wires. BOBBY wheels closer, tries to KICK the O.D. Without flinching, PETERS KNOCKS him back across the room, the chair FALLS OVER and Bobby moans. \nINT. CANTER'S PENTHOUSE/STUDY - DAY \nGREER SHOOTS THE GLASS, elbows out the shards and reaches in to unlock the balcony door. Keeping his gun ready, he limps painfully into the empty room. \n- DAY \nINT. CANTER'S PENTHOUSE/VARIOUS ROOMS \nQUICK CUTS as GREER hunts for Canter, flinging open doors into BEDROOMS, a LIVING ROOM, BATHROOMS. \nINT. LUXURY BUILDING/LOBBY - DAY \nThe CLERK, reactivated, leads a squad of UNIFORMED POLICE toward the stairwell. \nINT. CANTER'S PENTHOUSE/HALLWAY \nGREER has almost given up hope when he starts at a noise and spins, ready to shoot at-- --the AUTOMATED VACUUM humming around a corner. As it moves past his feet, Greer registers-- --a thin strip of RED LIGHT at floor level. After a moment, he begins rapping at the wall, realizing it's false. \nINT. LUXURY BUILDING/STAIRWELL - DAY \nTHE CLERK taps a CODE into the KEYPAD of the bullet- dented door. We hear a HEAVY LATCH disengage. \nINT. CANTER'S PENTHOUSE/HALLWAY - DAY \nGREER hears FOOTSTEPS of the approaching cops as he tries desperately to find a way into the hidden space. He discovers a LATCH at waist level, the wall becomes a pocket door. He lets himself in and closes it behind him \nJUST AS-- THE POLICE and the CLERK round the corner. \nINT. CANTER'S PENTHOUSE/CONTROL AREA - DAY \nPETERS/GREER This can really send a virus to every surrie on the network? \nBOBBY Sure, but it has to disconnect the operators first. \nPETERS/GREER (pauses, surprised) So people aren't in any danger... \nBOBBY Their surrogates are! Hurry up! \nON TERMINAL SCREEN - \"ABORT? YES. NO.\" \nINT. CANTER'S PENTHOUSE/CONTROL AREA - DAY \nTHE PROJECTOR SCREEN shows the words \"YES. NO.\" MOVE TO GREER, in the sensory projector, his face tight. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: CANTER stares at GREER, seeing that Greer realizes what's at stake-- the fate of humanity. \nCANTER You understand... \nINT. FBI BUILDING/SURVEILLANCE CENTER - DAY \nPETERS/GREER reaches for the keyboard again, hesitates. A moment of internal conflict. BOBBY stares, confused. \nBOBBY Do it! BANG! A CLEAN HEADSHOT drops PETERS/GREER in her tracks, ELECTRONIC GOO sprays the COMPUTER SCREEN. BOBBY spins in his chair. \nBOBBY (CONT'D) \nNOT He tries desperately to reach the keys himself, but-- ON SCREEN \"DISCONNECTING.\" He's too late. \nINT. CANTER'S PENTHOUSE/CONTROL AREA - DAY \nGREER yanks off the headset, breathing hard, eyes wide with shock. CANTER regards him from his wheelchair. He's been watching the MONITOR, knows what just happened. \nCANTER You could have stopped it. Thank you... \nGREER Why...? \nCANTER You know why. I won't be responsible for the death of humanity. I like the way you put it-- unringing a bell. GREER puts his head in his hands, realizing the enormity of what he's just done. \nGREER You created them. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCANTER I only sought to give people like me the chance to live normal lives. But my partners at VSI overrode me. They saw a much larger market-- surrogates for everyone. Healthy people. Children. A world without risk, without pain. Without feelings. Nothing at stake. Nothing to live for. Greer rises shakily. \nGREER What's going to happen? \nCANTER The day of resurrection. As he speaks, he raises a small white capsule to his lips. \nGREER No--! Before Greer can stop him, CANTER BITES INTO IT and swallows. Greer tries to get the capsule from Canter's mouth-- but the man is DEAD within moments. \nINT. FBI BUILDING/SURVEILLANCE CENTER - DAY \nBOBBY KICKS at the COMPUTER frantically, CRYING OUT. THE SNIPER reaches him, CUTS his HANDS free with a KNIFE. \nHUMAN SNIPER It's OK, sir, you're alright, it's \nOVER-- Freed, Bobby lunges at the keyboard, hitting keys in a frenzy, but-- ON SCREEN - \"DISCONNECTING\" changes to \"OPERATORS DISCONNECTED...\" Then, quickly-- \"TRANSMITTING.\" \nEXT. RESERVATION NO MAN'S LAND - DAY \nLATE AFTERNOON, golden light. DREADS have been herded together here, NATIONAL GUARDSMEN surrounding them. Suddenly the GUARDSMEN all DROP at once. \nEXT. WASHINGTON STREET - DAY \nCROWDED, rush hour, lots of traffic and noise. Then-- --PEDESTRIANS fall in a wave. CARS VEER out of control, SMASHING INTO EACH OTHER, careening onto the sidewalk, rolling over fallen surrie bodies and SMASHING into storefronts. \nINT. FBI BUILDING/BULLPEN - DAY \n", "test1_input": "GREER Till he retired. Had no idea he was that old. \nPROPHET (RADIO) .But this I promise: soon the abominations shall fall where they stand... and on that day of resurrection, the dead shall rise... \nEXT. MODERN APARTMENTS - NIGHT \nMOVE ACROSS the facade of a suburban apartment complex. A RED GLOW suffuses most of the windows, all of which are BARRED. In this warm light, we glimpse OPERATORS in reclining chairs, motionless. They could be watching TV, but no sets are in sight. MOVE TO FIND GREER and PETERS as they exit the sedan and pass a sign: \"SURROGATE-READY UNITS AVAILABLE.\" \nINT. MODERN APARTMENTS/CORRIDOR- NIGHT \nGREER and PETERS walk along an almost prison-like corridor, SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS, heavy doors. They follow an empty-faced walking MANNEQUIN in an ugly pantsuit. This is the LANDLADY. Her mouth moves like a ventriloquist's dummy as she speaks self-consciously: \nLANDLADY I been having problems with my surrie, this is just a loaner. Is there some kind of trouble? \nGREER Nothing to worry about. \nLANDLADY Cam's a good tenant, y'know. Pays the rent on time, never leaves the apartment... \nGREER Who does? \nLANDLADY (POUNDS on a door) Cam? Wake up, the police are here to talk to you... \nINT. CAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThe LANDLADY undoes the MULTIPLE LOCKS on the door of a small one-room apartment. She opens it and lets GREER and PETERS inside. A RED GLOW from the far end of the room-- GREER flicks on overheads. The Landlady hovers by the door as they move into the place. It's minimalist, nothing on the walls. Empty pizza boxes. Skirts, stockings, high-heels strewn around haphazardly. We also glimpse a large CHARGING CRADLE, contact points embedded in the foam inside, shaped to accomodate a curvaceous female body. \nGREER Hello? A fat, hairy arm hangs over the side of a high-tech CHAIR. The two feds move quickly to see-- --CAMERON MICHAELS, a 40-ish, overweight, bald male in his underwear. BLOOD runs from his nose, his face twitches slightly; he lies in a STIM CHAIR. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: STIM CHAIRS resemble-oversized massage chairs, contoured to the body, with padded head supports. They vibrate and electronically stimulate the user to prevent atrophy. A SENSORY PROJECTOR sits beside the chair. This device looks like a COMPUTER TOWER. It's linked to an elaborate HEADSET, with contact points around the skull. There's also a MONITOR SCREEN which displays the operator's remote POV. \nLANDLADY Oh my God, Cameron-- GREER quickly detaches the headset, rips a small ELECTRONIC SLEEVE off of Cameron's fingertip. He checks the man's pupil response and pulse. \nGREER Call the paramedics. While Peters calls in BG, GREER moves to the PROJECTOR'S MONITOR SCREEN and taps a touchpad. ON SCREEN - STATIC. GREER REWINDS to POVs at the hard- core CLUB. FAST FORWARD to the ALLEY, making out with TUXEDO. This is a recording of recent experience, as seen through the eyes of the BLONDE. GREER switches to real-time. Tuxedo breaks the kiss and turns to look OS. \nTUXEDO (ON SCREEN) Get lost, meatbag. As Tuxedo turns back TO CAMERA, we hear a hideous ELECTRONIC SCREECH, Tuxedo's face contorts in pain... and his EYES BURST, fragments of GLASS and ELECTRONICS fly. The POV reels, we hear the Blonde's SCREAM-- and STATIC again fills the screen. GREER is disturbed by this, looks again at the unconscious, quivering face of the man in the chair. \nCUT TO: \nINT. D.C. SUBWAY - NIGHT \nA mostly empty car, scattered SURRIE PASSENGERS ride stiffly, zoned out, empty expressions... except for a long-haired DREAD, one of the anti-surrogate fanatics. He's disheveled, hippyish, SHOUTS into the empty faces of the surrogates. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDREAD Wake up! Wake up! Zombies! Shitpuppetsl Abominations! He moves to a YOUNG COUPLE, both slack-faced, on standby. \nDREAD (CONT'D) Wake up and smell the piss! He starts to UNZIP in front of them. \nGREER Not cool. The DREAD turns-- GREER is holding up a BADGE. The Dread scowls, zips up and moves away from Greer, plunks down at the end of the car. Greer pockets his badge calmly. \nEXT. GREER'S BUILDING - DAWN \nGREER approaches an urban APARTMENT COMPLEX on foot, carrying a bag of TAKE-OUT FOOD. HIGH FENCES, SECURITY CAMERAS and SCANNERS, all commonplace in this world. We see the RED GLOW from a few windows. \nINT. GREER'S BUILDING/HALLWAY - DAWN \nGREER moves tiredly down a long hallway to his apartment. He punches in a CODE at the door. \nINT. GREER'S APARTMENT/LIVING ROOM - DAWN \nGREER enters, crosses a living room that's been decorated in a spare, modern style. \nINT. GREER'S APARTMENT/KITCHEN - DAWN \nGREER sets the bag down on a table, fills a glass with WATER and moves down a hallway to a BEDROOM. \nINT. GREER'S APARTMENT/BEDROOM -- DAWN \n", "test1_true": "(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: GREER, a surrogate we now realize, undresses, puts his clothes aside in a CLOSET-- which also contains a foam- filled CHARGING CRADLE. Down to his underwear, he backs into this, seems to relax. We hear a low HUM and-- --the REAL GREER's eyes open. He disconnects the HEADSET and FINGERSLEEVE, the RED GLOW is replaced by WHITE LIGHT. He sits up, yawns and sips the water. He rises wearily, stretches, runs a hand through his thinning hair. He moves to shut the closet door on his synth unit. As it CLOSES-- \nCUT TO: \nINT. GREER'S APARTMENT/KITCHEN - MORNING \nGREER (the real one) sits at the table in a bathrobe, finishing the food his surrogate brought home. As he empties the remains into the trash-- --MAGGIE enters. She's Greer's wife, a stylish young woman, looking ridiculously good for someone who's just gotten up. Maggie starts at the sight of Greer, begins to retreat. It's as if she's stumbled upon him in the bathroom. \nMAGGIE Oh, sorry-- \nGREER It's OK. Come in-- \nMAGGIE But where's your... \nGREER Put him up. I was about to get some sleep. Maggie enters the kitchen, not looking directly at Greer. She puts some bread in a toaster, prepares coffee. \nMAGGIE You just get in? \nGREER Some poor cross-sexual had an aneurysm while he was online, had to get him to a hospital. Maggie winces, disturbed by her husband's job. She flips on a small flatscreen TV, volume low. NEWS and WEATHER. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMAGGIE I think I need a new stim chair. \nGREER Bedsores? Want me to take a look? \nMAGGIE \n(TAKEN ABACK) No thanks, it's just some irritation. \nGREER Well, there's room on the credit card. \n(BEAT) It's been a while since... we've actually been together. \nMAGGIE \n(UNEASY) Are you talking about sex? \nGREER No, I just meant-- \nMAGGIE Because I think we're doing just fine. \nGREER But that's our surrogates. It's not the same... \nMAGGIE It's better. \n(SHRUGS) I wish that instead of working every night, you would come out with me, go dancing, we used to have such a good time-- \nGREER I was thinking more like a vacation. An island somewhere. \nMAGGIE (likes the idea) Bridget said she got an amazing deal on a surrie rental in Tahiti-- she looked just like a native. \nGREER I mean a real vacation-- just us. Leave our synth units home. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMAGGIE \n(HORRIFIED) And get on a plane? Her TOAST pops up. Maggie takes it with her coffee out of the room. She shakes her head, amused at Greer's crazy ideas. \nMAGGIE (CONT'D) Sleep well. She takes her breakfast through a door in the hall just off the kitchen-- we can't see inside the room. We hear the DOOR LOCK behind her. GREER looks after his wife, a bit dejected. In the quiet he registers a voice from the TV: \nCOMMERCIAL V.0. Remember... it wasn't long ago. ON TV - the sign \"AIR QUALITY - UNHEALTHFUL.\" PEDESTRIANS with surgical MASKS and even GASMASKS. The sign \"QUARANTINE.\" BODIES in a MASS GRAVE. The sign \"TERROR ALERT - HIGH.\" A BUSY CITY STREET. Suddenly, a massive EXPLOSION, a car bomb going off. From the blast, BLEACH TO WHITE. \n", "test2_input": "PETERS I can get you home. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nGREER I'll be OK. He moves toward the door, she tags along. \nGREER (CONT'D) I'm thinking you should double- check Strickland's records, go back to the hard copies. See if you can find out why they dropped charges. \nPETERS You seem better already. \nGREER It's like riding a bike. \nEXT. METRO ENTRANCE - DAY \nsubway, GREER and PETERS walk, he spots a sign for the changes direction to head for the escalator. \nPETERS Where you going? \nGREER It's a lovely day. Thought I'd take a trip to East Baltimore. He pauses at the top, a hit of vertigo. \nGREER (CONT'D) Was it always this steep? \nPETERS Jesus, Tom, the rez? \nGREER Since I'm stuck in my skin, I oughta take advantage of it. Hell, as long as Strickland has that device-- I'm safer this way. He clutches the handrail, starts moving down. \nPETERS Be careful. He nods and waves as he disappears down the escalator. \nCUT TO: \nINT. FBI BUILDING/LOBBY - DAY \nPETERS enters this large lobby, bustling with other AGENTS and OFFICIALS. She moves toward a DESK JOCKEY, security SCANNERS. She reacts to the sound of-- --SCREAMS and SCREECHING TIRES from outside the building. PETERS looks toward a large WINDOW to the street-- and immediately dives for cover as-- --a battered SUV, spray-painted with anti-surrogate GRAFFITI, SMASHES through the plate glass. SURRIE PEDESTRIANS are plastered across the grill and embedded in the windshield. THE SUV slams into a few SURRIES in the lobby, sends them flying or runs over them. It spins sideways into a WALL with the FBI SEAL overhead. The DRIVER leaps out, armed with a MACHINE GUN. He's clearly a DREAD, angry and deranged. He starts SHOOTING at anything that moves. PETERS crouches for cover as BULLETS shatter GLASS and smash MARBLE around her. An army of AGENTS burst from an elevator in Kevlar and riot helmets, armed with AUTOMATIC RIFLES. They instantly bring the DREAD down in a barrage of gunfire. The agents move to the DREAD'S BODY-- he's very dead, pouring BLOOD from dozens of bullet wounds. One speaks into his headset: \nRIOT AGENT Secure. \n(TO CROWD) Any biologicals here? \nCUT TO: \nINT. TAXICAB - DAY \nA SMALL FLAT-PANEL TV in the back of the CAB plays NEWS of the attack on the FBI building. PILES of surries removed on carts, one BODY on a stretcher. \nNEWS READER VOICE --twenty-seven surrogates irreparably damaged. Only one dead, the attacker himself. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nNEWS READER VOICE (CONT'D) His motive is unclear at this point, but may be a response to the recent incident at the Baltimore human reservation... GREER, in the back seat, takes in this news grimly. The CABBIE has been glancing at his own monitor in front. \nCABBIE Goddamn Dreads... sure you don't wanna change your mind? \nGREER I'm sure. \nEXT. BALTIMORE SLUMS - DAY \nLate afternoon. GREER emerges from a TAXI near the same gate we saw earlier. Greer wobbles, steadies himself against the car as he pays the CABBIE-- a DRONE SURROGATE, built into the seat. \nCABBIE You OK, man? \nGREER Just a little carsick. The TAXI pulls away, Greer heads for the GATE. \nEXT. RESERVATION NO MAN'S LAND - DAY \nAT THE GATE: METAL SIGNS read \"HUMANS ONLY - NO SURROGATES.\" GREER goes through a big,.old-fashioned (present-day) METAL DETECTOR, the light flashes GREEN. A DREAD GUARD waves him past. Greer gestures toward one of the many IMAGES OF THE PROPHET to be found in the rez. \n", "test2_true": "DREAD GUARD Ten blocks that way, left on Bloomfield. \nGREER Thanks. (eyes the grim area) Catch a lotta surries tryin' to sneak in, do ya? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDREAD GUARD Piss off. As Greer crosses the rubble-strewn no man's land, he pauses, sickened as he sees-- --the burned-out HELICOPTER HULK, now sprayed with GRAFITTI. \"PIGS DIE,\" etc. And just beyond this-- --what's left of GREER'S SURRIE, half the head blown off with fried electronics hanging out. It's been lashed to a makeshift crucifix, made from the bent CHOPPER BLADES. The clothing is shredded, the remains spray-painted. GREER, wary of being recognized, continues on. \nEXT. RESERVATION STREET - DAY \nGREER walks through a poor but surprisingly pleasant neighborhood-- rowhouses, gardens. Very few cars. DREADS look like ordinary working-class folks. A BARBECUE, a group of RESIDENTS laughing and drinking. Greer inhales the SMOKE as he passes, smiles to himself. A couple of FRIENDLY DOGS trot curiously after him for a moment, then return to the barbecue. GREER, not paying attention, brushes past an ELDERLY MALE PEDESTRIAN. \nGREER Excuse me. \nPEDESTRIAN (smiles and nods) No problem. A PLAYGROUND a short distance on,.LOTS OF KIDS shrieking and running. Greer pauses here, taking this in. These are the first children we've seen, outside of a TV ad. A CLOUD OF DIESEL SMOKE from a decrepit BUS. Greer CHOKES on this, but doesn't seem displeased. His body language has become more relaxed as he gets further into the rez, getting his land legs back. \nINT. RESERVATION TEMPLE - DAY \nA cavernous convention center, thousands of folding chairs face a raised PULPIT at one end. Behind this is a SUPERGRAPHIC of the PROPHET, hands raised in benediction. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: GREER enters, takes this in. He spots a CLEANING LADY, an older woman sweeping up amidst the rows nearby. \nGREER Excuse me. You wouldn't happen to know a Jack Strickland? I'm told he worked here off and on. \nCLEANING LADY \n(NODS) You're here for the service? It's in the park. \nEXT. RESERVATION PARK - DUSK \nGREER moves down a path in this expanse of greenery. He comes to an open lawn with a fairly large CROWD gathered, illuminated by a FLAMING TORCH. THE PROPHET is speaking. He stands before a platform atop wooden scaffolding, firewood piled below. A formidable ring of BODYGUARDS stands between him and the gathered throng of DREADS. \nPROPHET --serving faithfully beside us in the cause of humanity. _I had the privilege of hearing his confession shortly before his death. GREER has pushed his way gently toward the front to get a look at the BODY atop the funeral BIER. The corpse atop the bier is that of JACK STRICKLAND, eyes closed, hands folded. \nPROPHET (CONT'D) And I know he would have rejoiced in the day of resurrection, the day for which we are all preparing, the day I promise you is close at hand... So saying, the PROPHET lifts the torch and touches it to the base of the PYRE, which ERUPTS IN FLAME. CLOSE ON STRICKLAND as the FLAMES lick up around him. LATER, the BIER consumed in FIRE, the MOURNERS dispersing. THE PROPHET is moving away, HANDLERS surrounding him. GREER tags along-- but one of the Prophet's goons, BUD, gets in his face. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBUD Who are you? \nGREER What happened to Jack Strickland? \nBUD He slipped and fell. Friend of yours? Greer starts to move around him, Bud gets in his way. \nGREER I'd like a word with the Prophet. \nBUD You and everyone else. MILLER and ADAMS, another goon, now join them. \nGREER Strickland was carrying a weapon. If it isn't recovered, there could be serious consequences-- for all of you. IN BG, the PROPHET and HANDLERS head toward a large RV. \nMILLER You some kinda cop? Where's your puppet? \nGREER Needs repairs. \nMILLER You armed? GREER shakes his head, raises his hands. \nGREER Frisk me if you want. \nMILLER No, that's OK. With that, he throws a SUCKER PUNCH to the gut. GREER doubles over. He seems amazed at the sensation, the pain. But he recovers, throws a wild punch at Miller an d misses by a foot. [Violence for Greer in human form should have a very different, painfully visceral feel, unlike when he was a surrogate.] \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) ADAMS cracks Greer across the back of his head. GREER falls to the ground. BUD kicks him once. GREER chokes and groans in pain. \n", "test3_input": "CONTINUED: He passes the SURRIE SCANNER and holds his hand over a FINGERPRINT MACHINE, which confirms his identity. A plexiglas door unlocks automatically. \nDESK JOCKEY Says here you're on suspension. \nGREER Mm. Just cleaning out my desk. \nDESK JOCKEY \n(EYING HIM) Y'know, you're thinner on top. \nGREER Nice of you to notice. You remember where the rest rooms are? \nDESK JOCKEY They mostly use 'em for storage. Think the one on four still works. Greer nods and continues in. \nINT. FBI BUILDING/CHARGING ROOM - NIGHT \nDOZENS of SURROGATE AGENTS are lined up against the wall in here, in their foam CHARGING BAYS. CAMERA FINDS PETERS in their midst. Her bay HUMS and she blinks, becomes animated. She steps out of the bay. \nINT. FBI BUILDING/GREER'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nGREER has his feet up on his desk, the bottle beside him. There are cardboard BOXES of DOCUMENTS nearby. PETERS enters, Greer looks up at her. \nPETERS Got your message. \nGREER Hope I didn't wake you. \nPETERS After what happened here today I couldn't sleep. \nGREER You tell anyone I was going out to the rez? Canter, for example? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPETERS \n(TAKEN ABACK) No. Of course not. Greer studies her a beat, decides she's sincere. A sigh. Peters sits on his desk, studies him. \nPETERS (CONT'D) You look terrible. \nGREER Not half as bad as I feel. Greer refills his coffee cup with Scotch, holds the bottle out to her questioningly. \nPETERS No thanks. \nGREER Come on. Just pretend to get drunk with me. Peters shakes her head with a smile. Greer shrugs, takes a long drink, sighs and rubs his sore neck. \nGREER (CONT'D) Feel like I've been asleep for years-- now I wake up an old man. Rip Van Frigging Winkle... Peters moves behind him, begins rubbing his shoulders, a massage. \nGREER (CONT'D) What are you doing? \nPETERS You look like you need it. \nGREER I'm not sure how kosher this is... \nPETERS Relax. It's not me, it's not a woman touching you-- it's just a machine. \nGREER Does feel good... better than a stim chair. He allows himself to enjoy it for a moment, bows his head. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nGREER (CONT'D) You ever feel like it's... over? \nPETERS What. \nGREER Us. People. The stuff that used to make the world make sense. That made us... human. I don't know, morality, love. Whatever. \n(BEAT) Yeah, yeah, they were probably saying that back in ancient Rome. \nPETERS We always think technology's going to improve our lives, but... \n", "test3_true": "GREER (CONT'D) This has become obsolete. Someday soon, we'll all just be brains in jars. \nPETERS Maybe not. I have a feeling people are going to come to their senses eventually. \nGREER (shaking his head) You can't unring a bell. (turns toward her) Thought you were the one all into the brave new world. PETERS is staring at her own plastic hand. She looks up at Greer, changes the subject. \nPETERS I found out about Strickland. She gestures to the boxes of documents. \nPETERS (CONT'D) All the chaos, I was able to waltz right into the records department. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nPETERS (CONT'D) The case files were removed, but there was a paper trail from payroll... Strickland was an informant. \nGREER \n(PERKING UP) For us? Who was running him? \nPETERS Wasn't in the paperwork. But he must've been selling intel on the Prophet. Greer has risen, moving restlessly around the room. \nGREER So the Prophet has him killed. And we have to assume he now has the power to kill anyone he wants... \nCUT TO: \n- DAY \nINT. MARINE BASE/COLONEL BRANDON'S OFFICE \nCLOSE on a PHOTO of the DEVICE in Strickland's hand. The image has been ENLARGED, giving a pretty clear view of the weapon. \nBRANDON Where'd you get this photo? GREER sits opposite COLONEL BRANDON at the man's desk, a FLAG and other MILITARY MEMORABILIA on display. Greer eyes the colonel, knows something's up. \nGREER It's from my memory. Damn thing put me in the hospital. \nBRANDON Wish I could help. \nGREER Killed a couple of cops as well. We believe this weapon-- the one that doesn't exist-- is in the hands of the Human Coalition. Brandon is finally losing his composure. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBRANDON If this is true... we're going to have to do everything in our-power to recover it. Do you have any idea how serious this is? \nGREER I was hoping you'd tell me. BRANDON looks conflicted, finally opens up. \nBRANDON This is absolutely off the record. (off Greer's nod) It's called an Overload Device, or O.D. They're brand new, only a handful exist. But I checked, ran every serial number-- all accounted for. \nGREER Not this one. Maybe it never got to you guys in the first place. Who makes them? \nBRANDON It's a DARPA design, subcontracted to Pierson Defense. The idea was to create a non-lethal weapon that could disable every surrie in the field. You beam a software virus straight to the CPU. The fail-safes kick in and the operators are cut off. Circuits all melt down in seconds, you're left with a field full of scrap. \nGREER You win the battle with one shot. \n(BEAT) Let me guess. You found a way around the fail-safes. \nBRANDON \n(GRIM NOD) Just a few lines of code, the connection stays open. We tried it on soldier volunteers... once. The virus caused every neuron to fire at the same time. Melted their brains. \nGREER So it's an assassination tool. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \n"}

{"test1_input": "SURROGATES \nWritten by \nJohn Brancato & Michael Ferris \nBased on the graphic novel \n\"THE SURROGATES\" \nBy \nRobert Venditti \nOctober 16, 2007 \nFADE IN ON: \nEXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT -- MOVING \nA DISTORTED IMAGE of downtown city streets at night. This is not a FISHEYE LENS, but the REFLECTION in the mirrored surface of a helmet visor. \nEXT. LUXURY BUILDING - NIGHT \nA near-future MOTORCYCLE stops near a dramatic HIGH-RISE RESIDENTIAL BUILDING. The rider, clad in black leather, climbs off his machine. We'll call him the ASSASSIN. He flips up his VISOR. His face is scarred, stubbly. He conceals himself in an alcove, eyes never leaving the building's entrance. A uniformed DOORMAN opens the high-rise's lobby door for a HANDSOME YOUNG MAN in a TUXEDO and TRENCHCOAT. THE ASSASSIN has been waiting for this. He removes what looks like a rifle scope from his jacket, aims it at \nTUXEDO. SCOPE POV - focusing on TUXEDO'S FACE, magnified. A digital readout: \"SCANNING...\" Then a long SERIAL NUMBER reads out and the name, \"LIONEL ALEXANDER CANTER,\" along with other personal information below. THE ASSASSIN puts away the scanner scope, satisfied. He reaches a hand into a pocket, withdraws a mysterious DEVICE. The size of a first generation cellphone, it has a military look, with a clear sliding panel over safety switches and buttons. The ASSASSIN hurries toward TUXEDO, but before he can \nREACH HIM-- A sleek, futuristic LIMOUSINE pulls up and TUXEDO gets in the back. They're gone in an instant. The ASSASSIN, frustrated, dashes for his MOTORCYCLE. He starts it and pursues the limousine. \nEXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT \nTHE MOTORCYCLE pursues the LIMOUSINE along the Potomac, D. C. LANDMARKS visible in the distance. \nEXT. KENNEDY CENTER - NIGHT \nFORMAL CROWDS, a RED CARPET, signs for an OPERA. The LIMOUSINE approaches. \nINT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT \nTUXEDO leans forward to the DRIVER, a muscular, handsome man in a suit named ARMANDO. \nTUXEDO I'm not really in the mood for opera, Armando. ARMANDO nods knowingly pulls back into traffic. \nARMANDO F Street? \nTUXEDO \n(UNDOING BOWTIE) You read my mind. Let's not mention this to my Dad... As he speaks, he passes a few BILLS over the seat. \nEXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT \nTHE LIMO moves through this seemingly deserted area, pulls up near a STEEL DOOR with a spray-painted X. TUXEDO emerges sans jacket and tie, his dress-shirt open. \nTUXEDO I can find my way back. ARMANDO nods and pulls away. TUXEDO moves toward the entrance, says a word into an INTERCOM with a SURVEILLANCE CAMERA. The door opens within moments, he disappears inside. THE ASSASSIN parks his bike, a few steps behind. Tuxedo has vanished through the STEEL DOOR before he can catch up with him. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: The ASSASSIN takes off his helmet, tries the door. It won't move. He buzzes the intercom. The DOOR slides open a crack-- THE BOUNCER is a huge, bald man with JET BLACK skin, RED EYES and TEETH that glow fluorescently. The THROBBING BEAT of MUSIC within. The BOUNCER narrows his eyes. \nBOUNCER This is a private club. \nASSASSIN I just need to talk to-- THE STEEL DOOR has already shut in his face. \nINT. THE PIT - NIGHT \nPOUNDING MUSIC. BODIES SLAM together in a brutal mosh pit, MEN and WOMEN. All are young, some beautiful, others extremely decorated and pierced. They tear at each other brutally, trying to do real damage. On the edges of the pit, individual FISTFIGHTS go on. An incongruous CHANDELIER overhead, gilt-edged MIRRORS on the walls-- the FIGHTERS SLAM INTO and SHATTER them. A HARD-CORE BAND plays on an elevated stage. The MUSICIANS are heavily punked out, in outlandish clothes, with pierced faces, tattoos and body make-up. IN A VIP AREA, a balcony elevated above the stage, numerous BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE at tables. Many are making out, gay, straight, threesomes-- orgies happen up here. TUXEDO sits by himself. He raises a GLASS TUBE attached to a CORD, one of a few leading into an ELECTRONIC DEVICE on the table. As he brings the tube close to his own neck, an ARC of electricity jumps to his skin. His features go slack, a shudder goes through him. Then he lowers the tube with a smile. He's using a JACKER-- a sort of electro-shock hookah. A SHOUT over the MUSIC: \nBLONDE Mind if I join you? A stunningly beautiful BLONDE in edgy, dramatic clothes stands nearby. Tuxedo, recovering from the hit, gestures graciously for her to sit. She picks up one of the cords, gives him a sly smile. She opens her mouth, SPARKS fly to her tongue and-- \nCUT TO: \n", "test1_true": "RAIN pours down as TUXEDO and the BLONDE burst out the door, laughing. He pushes her against a brick wall, they grope each other hungrily, hands inside clothes, getting drenched in the warm downpour. WITH THE ASSASSIN, wearing his HELMET with the VISOR UP, as he approaches the entwined couple. TUXEDO hears him, \nTURNS-- \nTUXEDO Get lost, meatbag. \nEXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT \nANGLE ON the alley's mouth as we hear the BLONDE'S SCREAM. Seconds later she staggers out, clutching her head, and collapses to the pavement. We hear an ENGINE START from the alleyway. THE ASSASSIN emerges on his bike, rides directly over her body unconcerned-- and ROARS into the night. CAMERA PULLS UP to-- \nEXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT \n--an AERIAL VIEW of the rain-swept CITY, some futuristic HIGH-RISES amongst the recognizeable landmarks. Also, a great number of SUPER-CELL TOWERS and DISHES, considerably larger than the ones we see today. CAMERA PICKS UP SPEED, moves quickly to a run-down part of the city, tenements and vacant lots. MOVE DOWN and through a third-story window of-- \nINT. ABANDONED PROJECT BUILDING - NIGHT \nA dark, decaying hallway. A MAN and a WOMAN move stealthily up the stairs, LASER-SIGHT GUNS in hand. The man is THOMAS GREER, the woman JENNIFER PETERS. Both are about 30, handsome, athletic. Greer's spent his life in law enforcement. He's smart and able, wants things to make sense-- but as the world changes around him, he feels he's losing the thread. PETERS is junior to Greer, her attitude's professional but rigid, by the book. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: GREER, in the lead, waves PETERS up. They approach a door at the end of the hall. We see now that their windbreakers read \"FBI.\" GREER kicks open the door-- \nINT. PSYCHO'S LAIR - NIGHT \nLit by CANDLES and KEROSENE LANTERNS, SMOKE HANGS in the room. We glimpse BODIES hanging from the ceiling in CHAINS. GREER and PETERS train their LASERS around the place, disturbed by the scene. A flash of MOVEMENT in a bedroom and a CRASH-- THE PSYCHO who lives here has kicked over a LANTERN, FIRE spills across the floor. We glimpse a surprisingly good- looking guy, grinning maniacally. He dashes across the \nROOM-- GREER squeezes off a couple of SHOTS. The PSYCHO's too fast, he LEAPS through a cracked WINDOW. \nEXT. ABANDONED PROJECTS - NIGHT \nRAIN has let up. The PSYCHO FALLS thirty feet into a pile of soft DIRT and TRASH. He rolls to the bottom, gets to his feet and runs. GREER looks down from the broken window. \nINT. PSYCHO'S LAIR - NIGHT \nPETERS is beating at the FLAMES with a towel, sees Greer is preparing to jump. \nPETERS Let's call for back-up. \nGREER Where'.s the sport in that? \nPETERS \nIT'S PROTOCOL-- GREER SNORTS and-- \nEXT. ABANDONED PROJECTS - NIGHT \n--LEAPS, GREER hits the dirt hard and rolls. He reaches the ground and sets off after the PSYCHO at top speed. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: PLAY A FRANTIC FOOT CHASE, both men scramble over chain- link fences, leap over trashed cars. GREER pursues the PSYCHO around a corner, into a passageway between buildings-- --wherethePSYCHO gets the jump on him, SWINGS a length of pipeathis head. Greer ducks fast, the blow catches him inthearm, he drops his gun. The PSYCHO moves to pick uptheweapon, but Greer tackles him against a dumpster. Greer SLAMS the dumpster lid on the man repeatedly. \nGREER You have the right to remain silent-- But the PSYCHO has grabbed something from the trash, manages to SQUIRT BUG SPRAY in Greer's eyes. Greer's blinded temporarily, the PSYCHO squirms away, running from between buildings across a street-- WHAM! He's hit full-on by a SEMI, his body FLIES through the air. He LANDS HARD on cement, but amazingly is still alive. He tries to get up, but-- GREER plants a foot on his chest and holds him fast against the ground. Greer, still wiping at this eyes, points his weapon at the PSYCHO's head. \nGREER (CONT'D) Stay with me asshole-- \nPSYCHO Why would I do that? The PSYCHO grins-- then his head lolls back, eyes empty. \nINT. PSYCHO'S LAIR - NIGHT \nPETERS is by a WOMAN'S BODY on the floor, holding a pocket SCANNER close to her head. This small device resembles an iPhone. There's tape over the woman's eyes and mouth, which Peters peels away as she speaks into a tiny cellphone earpiece. \nPETERS Is this Kathy Welles...? My name is Jennifer Peters, with the FBI's surrogate crime division... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: ON SCANNER-- the name \"KATHY WELLES,\" \"REPORTED STOLEN,\" contact information below. \nEXT. ABANDONED PROJECTS - NIGHT \n", "test1_id": 3189, "test2_input": "GREER Till he retired. Had no idea he was that old. \nPROPHET (RADIO) .But this I promise: soon the abominations shall fall where they stand... and on that day of resurrection, the dead shall rise... \nEXT. MODERN APARTMENTS - NIGHT \nMOVE ACROSS the facade of a suburban apartment complex. A RED GLOW suffuses most of the windows, all of which are BARRED. In this warm light, we glimpse OPERATORS in reclining chairs, motionless. They could be watching TV, but no sets are in sight. MOVE TO FIND GREER and PETERS as they exit the sedan and pass a sign: \"SURROGATE-READY UNITS AVAILABLE.\" \nINT. MODERN APARTMENTS/CORRIDOR- NIGHT \nGREER and PETERS walk along an almost prison-like corridor, SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS, heavy doors. They follow an empty-faced walking MANNEQUIN in an ugly pantsuit. This is the LANDLADY. Her mouth moves like a ventriloquist's dummy as she speaks self-consciously: \nLANDLADY I been having problems with my surrie, this is just a loaner. Is there some kind of trouble? \nGREER Nothing to worry about. \nLANDLADY Cam's a good tenant, y'know. Pays the rent on time, never leaves the apartment... \nGREER Who does? \nLANDLADY (POUNDS on a door) Cam? Wake up, the police are here to talk to you... \nINT. CAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThe LANDLADY undoes the MULTIPLE LOCKS on the door of a small one-room apartment. She opens it and lets GREER and PETERS inside. A RED GLOW from the far end of the room-- GREER flicks on overheads. The Landlady hovers by the door as they move into the place. It's minimalist, nothing on the walls. Empty pizza boxes. Skirts, stockings, high-heels strewn around haphazardly. We also glimpse a large CHARGING CRADLE, contact points embedded in the foam inside, shaped to accomodate a curvaceous female body. \nGREER Hello? A fat, hairy arm hangs over the side of a high-tech CHAIR. The two feds move quickly to see-- --CAMERON MICHAELS, a 40-ish, overweight, bald male in his underwear. BLOOD runs from his nose, his face twitches slightly; he lies in a STIM CHAIR. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: STIM CHAIRS resemble-oversized massage chairs, contoured to the body, with padded head supports. They vibrate and electronically stimulate the user to prevent atrophy. A SENSORY PROJECTOR sits beside the chair. This device looks like a COMPUTER TOWER. It's linked to an elaborate HEADSET, with contact points around the skull. There's also a MONITOR SCREEN which displays the operator's remote POV. \nLANDLADY Oh my God, Cameron-- GREER quickly detaches the headset, rips a small ELECTRONIC SLEEVE off of Cameron's fingertip. He checks the man's pupil response and pulse. \nGREER Call the paramedics. While Peters calls in BG, GREER moves to the PROJECTOR'S MONITOR SCREEN and taps a touchpad. ON SCREEN - STATIC. GREER REWINDS to POVs at the hard- core CLUB. FAST FORWARD to the ALLEY, making out with TUXEDO. This is a recording of recent experience, as seen through the eyes of the BLONDE. GREER switches to real-time. Tuxedo breaks the kiss and turns to look OS. \nTUXEDO (ON SCREEN) Get lost, meatbag. As Tuxedo turns back TO CAMERA, we hear a hideous ELECTRONIC SCREECH, Tuxedo's face contorts in pain... and his EYES BURST, fragments of GLASS and ELECTRONICS fly. The POV reels, we hear the Blonde's SCREAM-- and STATIC again fills the screen. GREER is disturbed by this, looks again at the unconscious, quivering face of the man in the chair. \nCUT TO: \nINT. D.C. SUBWAY - NIGHT \nA mostly empty car, scattered SURRIE PASSENGERS ride stiffly, zoned out, empty expressions... except for a long-haired DREAD, one of the anti-surrogate fanatics. He's disheveled, hippyish, SHOUTS into the empty faces of the surrogates. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDREAD Wake up! Wake up! Zombies! Shitpuppetsl Abominations! He moves to a YOUNG COUPLE, both slack-faced, on standby. \nDREAD (CONT'D) Wake up and smell the piss! He starts to UNZIP in front of them. \nGREER Not cool. The DREAD turns-- GREER is holding up a BADGE. The Dread scowls, zips up and moves away from Greer, plunks down at the end of the car. Greer pockets his badge calmly. \nEXT. GREER'S BUILDING - DAWN \nGREER approaches an urban APARTMENT COMPLEX on foot, carrying a bag of TAKE-OUT FOOD. HIGH FENCES, SECURITY CAMERAS and SCANNERS, all commonplace in this world. We see the RED GLOW from a few windows. \nINT. GREER'S BUILDING/HALLWAY - DAWN \nGREER moves tiredly down a long hallway to his apartment. He punches in a CODE at the door. \nINT. GREER'S APARTMENT/LIVING ROOM - DAWN \nGREER enters, crosses a living room that's been decorated in a spare, modern style. \nINT. GREER'S APARTMENT/KITCHEN - DAWN \nGREER sets the bag down on a table, fills a glass with WATER and moves down a hallway to a BEDROOM. \nINT. GREER'S APARTMENT/BEDROOM -- DAWN \n", "test2_true": "(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: GREER, a surrogate we now realize, undresses, puts his clothes aside in a CLOSET-- which also contains a foam- filled CHARGING CRADLE. Down to his underwear, he backs into this, seems to relax. We hear a low HUM and-- --the REAL GREER's eyes open. He disconnects the HEADSET and FINGERSLEEVE, the RED GLOW is replaced by WHITE LIGHT. He sits up, yawns and sips the water. He rises wearily, stretches, runs a hand through his thinning hair. He moves to shut the closet door on his synth unit. As it CLOSES-- \nCUT TO: \nINT. GREER'S APARTMENT/KITCHEN - MORNING \nGREER (the real one) sits at the table in a bathrobe, finishing the food his surrogate brought home. As he empties the remains into the trash-- --MAGGIE enters. She's Greer's wife, a stylish young woman, looking ridiculously good for someone who's just gotten up. Maggie starts at the sight of Greer, begins to retreat. It's as if she's stumbled upon him in the bathroom. \nMAGGIE Oh, sorry-- \nGREER It's OK. Come in-- \nMAGGIE But where's your... \nGREER Put him up. I was about to get some sleep. Maggie enters the kitchen, not looking directly at Greer. She puts some bread in a toaster, prepares coffee. \nMAGGIE You just get in? \nGREER Some poor cross-sexual had an aneurysm while he was online, had to get him to a hospital. Maggie winces, disturbed by her husband's job. She flips on a small flatscreen TV, volume low. NEWS and WEATHER. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMAGGIE I think I need a new stim chair. \nGREER Bedsores? Want me to take a look? \nMAGGIE \n(TAKEN ABACK) No thanks, it's just some irritation. \nGREER Well, there's room on the credit card. \n(BEAT) It's been a while since... we've actually been together. \nMAGGIE \n(UNEASY) Are you talking about sex? \nGREER No, I just meant-- \nMAGGIE Because I think we're doing just fine. \nGREER But that's our surrogates. It's not the same... \nMAGGIE It's better. \n(SHRUGS) I wish that instead of working every night, you would come out with me, go dancing, we used to have such a good time-- \nGREER I was thinking more like a vacation. An island somewhere. \nMAGGIE (likes the idea) Bridget said she got an amazing deal on a surrie rental in Tahiti-- she looked just like a native. \nGREER I mean a real vacation-- just us. Leave our synth units home. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMAGGIE \n(HORRIFIED) And get on a plane? Her TOAST pops up. Maggie takes it with her coffee out of the room. She shakes her head, amused at Greer's crazy ideas. \nMAGGIE (CONT'D) Sleep well. She takes her breakfast through a door in the hall just off the kitchen-- we can't see inside the room. We hear the DOOR LOCK behind her. GREER looks after his wife, a bit dejected. In the quiet he registers a voice from the TV: \nCOMMERCIAL V.0. Remember... it wasn't long ago. ON TV - the sign \"AIR QUALITY - UNHEALTHFUL.\" PEDESTRIANS with surgical MASKS and even GASMASKS. The sign \"QUARANTINE.\" BODIES in a MASS GRAVE. The sign \"TERROR ALERT - HIGH.\" A BUSY CITY STREET. Suddenly, a massive EXPLOSION, a car bomb going off. From the blast, BLEACH TO WHITE. \n", "test2_id": 3190, "test3_input": "STONE We spend years trying to nail you for funding the Dreads-- and now you hand yourself over to us on a silver platter. Hijacking an agent, destroying federal property, creating a hostage situation... Peters pulls her gun and points it at BOBBY'S HEAD. He cowers in his chair. \nSTONE (CONT'D) I wouldn't add homicide to that list. As it is, you're going to prison for a very long time. He turns on his heel, begins walking back up the stairs for the door. PETERS lowers the gun, reaches into her pocket and pulls out the Q.D. WEAPON. \nPETERS An eye for an eye... She points it at the back of Stone's head and-- --STONE's eyes go wide in agony-- and EXPLODE. He goes TUMBLING back down the stairs, SMOKE pouring from his head, BODY twitching crazily. \nINT. LUXURY BUILDING/STAIRWELL - DAY \n--GREER is GASPING for breath as he reaches an upper landing. Ahead of him is a heavy STEEL DOOR with a KEYPAD LOCK. He tries the handle, kicks the door once, then pulls his gun and aims it at the lock, turning away as he SHOOTS. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: THE BULLET RICOCHETS about the narrow area, scaring the hell out of him. The LOCK is intact. \nGREER Damn it! He moves to a NARROWER STAIRCASE with a sign, \"ROOF \nACCESS.\" \nINT. FBI BUILDING/SURVEILLANCE CENTER - DAY \nThe RIOT AGENTS pour in now, GUNS FIRING. PETERS drops behind a bank of TERMINALS for cover. BULLETS rocket past, one CATCHES her in the arm, but barely phases her. THE RIOT AGENTS move in, military style, surrounding \nPETERS. PETERS fiddles with the O.D.-- CLOSE - she slides back a panel, hits a couple of tiny SWITCHES-- the RED DIODES go to BLUE. PETERS points the device over the terminal, sweeps it in \nAN ARC-- --the RIOT AGENTS all FREEZE'IN PLACE for a second-- and then drop at once. Unlike with Stone, there's no twitching, smoke or exploding eyeballs. The sudden silence is eerie. PETERS rises and moves to STONE, the grotesque, empty- eyed surrogate. Her expression is grim, but she's accomplished an important part of her mission. BOBBY looks around at the many fallen bodies. \nBOBBY Are they dead? \nPETERS (re: the riot agents) They're fine. \nINT. STONE'S STUDY - DAY \nThe PHONE IS RINGING. Move from it to-- STONE, in his stim chair, projector on his head... eyes rolled back, dead. BLOOD begins to seep from his ears. \nEXT. CANTER'S BUILDING/ROOF/BALCONY - DAY \nGREER has come out on the roof. There's an enormous CELL TOWER and DISH up here. He moves to the edge, peers over warily. ANGLE DOWN - forty stories down to the street. GREER flinches back, reeling with vertigo. He moves along the edge, looking for something. ANGLE DOWN - the BALCONY outside Canter's study, just inside the roof overhang, a fifteen-foot drop. GREER squeezes his eyes shut, steeling himself for what he must do. He lowers himself to hang onto the edge, trying not to look down. He swings his body to get the momentum going the right way-- --but his grip gives a moment too soon-- GREER plunges from the roof to the BALCONY RAIL, hitting the railing hard, starting to fall off the wrong way. But he manages to grab onto the metal. He hauls himself up and collapses onto the balcony, lying on his back. HIS LEG has been injured in the fall, the pants torn, blood. GREER breathes audibly, in pain and exhaustion. \nINT. FBI BUILDING/SURVEILLANCE CENTER - DAY \nON THE TERMINAL - numbers still HIGHLIGHTING, flying past at incredible speed. MOVE TO FIND PETERS, with an open TOOLBOX. She's expertly wiring the O.D. to the keyboard, cutting, splicing and reattaching wires. BOBBY wheels closer, tries to KICK the O.D. Without flinching, PETERS KNOCKS him back across the room, the chair FALLS OVER and Bobby moans. \nINT. CANTER'S PENTHOUSE/STUDY - DAY \nGREER SHOOTS THE GLASS, elbows out the shards and reaches in to unlock the balcony door. Keeping his gun ready, he limps painfully into the empty room. \n- DAY \nINT. CANTER'S PENTHOUSE/VARIOUS ROOMS \nQUICK CUTS as GREER hunts for Canter, flinging open doors into BEDROOMS, a LIVING ROOM, BATHROOMS. \nINT. LUXURY BUILDING/LOBBY - DAY \nThe CLERK, reactivated, leads a squad of UNIFORMED POLICE toward the stairwell. \nINT. CANTER'S PENTHOUSE/HALLWAY \nGREER has almost given up hope when he starts at a noise and spins, ready to shoot at-- --the AUTOMATED VACUUM humming around a corner. As it moves past his feet, Greer registers-- --a thin strip of RED LIGHT at floor level. After a moment, he begins rapping at the wall, realizing it's false. \nINT. LUXURY BUILDING/STAIRWELL - DAY \nTHE CLERK taps a CODE into the KEYPAD of the bullet- dented door. We hear a HEAVY LATCH disengage. \nINT. CANTER'S PENTHOUSE/HALLWAY - DAY \nGREER hears FOOTSTEPS of the approaching cops as he tries desperately to find a way into the hidden space. He discovers a LATCH at waist level, the wall becomes a pocket door. He lets himself in and closes it behind him \nJUST AS-- THE POLICE and the CLERK round the corner. \nINT. CANTER'S PENTHOUSE/CONTROL AREA - DAY \n", "test3_true": "BAY. Beside him is the BOY who picked Greer up in the limo. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: WIDER, a dozen SURROGATES, different ages and sexes, lined up in their charging bays. Clearly, Canter can become anyone he wants to be. GREER is momentarily stunned to see-- THE PROPHET, a spare surrogate, in a charging bay. GREER moves carefully onward. Around a corner, he sees-- --a PROJECTOR DISPLAY SCREEN. It's PETERS' POV on the FBI SURVEILLANCE CENTER, a glance toward the motionless RIOT AGENTS, to BOBBY struggling on the ground. PETERS' POV SETTLES on the numbers HIGHLIGHTING on the terminal. THE 0. D. is connected to the keyboard, BLUE DIODES FLASH, the jerry-rigging complete. REAL CANTER is visible from behind in an elaborate prosthetic WHEELCHAIR, a SENSORY PROJECTOR on his head. GREER moves toward him and RIPS OFF the headgear. REAL CANTER opens his eyes, startled. \nGREER You're insane. \nINT. FBI BUILDING/SURVEILLANCE CENTER -- DAY \nPETERS is frozen in place by the-terminal. BOBBY, on the ground, realizes something's happened. He strains to see the numbers screen. ON SCREEN -- THE NUMBERS have stopped scrolling. A dialogue box: \"FULL DATABASE SELECTED - UPLOADING SOFTWARE TO NETWORK\" with a bar moving up slowly. \nINT. CANTER'S PENTHOUSE/CONTROL AREA - DAY \nCANTER squints up at GREER from his wheelchair and brace. He speaks with an ELECTRONIC AID, his voice slightly artificial-sounding. \nCANTER Jennifer Peters. Is she-- \nGREER She's dead. \nCANTER I had no intention of hurting her. I'm truly sorry-- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGREER You bastard, she was my partner, I cared about her-- \nCANTER Did you? You barely knew her. It was me you came to care about-- \nGREER Shut up! Greer clenches his fist, if the man wasn't in a wheelchair he would beat the hell out of him. Struggling to control himself, mind reeling: \nGREER (CONT'D) How many people are you? You're really the Prophet? \nCANTER I had to fight VSI any way I could. As canter speaks, his eyes flick toward the PROJECTOR'S \nMONITOR-- --the image of the O.D. DEVICE UPLOADING SOFTWARE from PETERS' POV. Canter tries to block Greer's view-- \nCANTER (CONT'D) There's nothing you can do-- GREER PUSHES CANTER'S WHEELCHAIR out of the way violently. Greer sits on the floor, leaning against the wall. He takes a breath and puts on the PROJECTOR HEADSET. He slips on the FINGERSLEEVE, presses his fingers together and-- \nINT. FBI BUILDING/SURVEILLANCE CENTER - DAY \n--PETERS is suddenly REANIMATED, stumbles a bit where she stands, as Greer gets his bearings in this new body. He moves to the KEYBOARD and RIPS THE O.D. from the jerry- rigged connection. - \nON TERMINAL SCREEN -- \"UPLOAD COMPLETE.\" PETERS turns to BOBBY. \nPETERS How do I shut it down? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBOBBY \n(BAFFLED) You... \nPETERS Bobby, this is Agent Greer! ON THE CATWALK - a HUMAN agent, he's a SNIPER in black, creeps into position, readying his rifle. PETERS/GREER helps BOBBY up, so that he can see the computer screen. Bobby remains cuffed. \nON SCREEN - \"PREPARING TO DISCONNECT OPERATORS - 30 SECONDS.\" The number is counting down. \nBOBBY \n(THINKING) OK... the software from that thing's already in the system, you have to abort transmission. \nPETERS/GREER \n(DESPERATE) How?1 \nBOBBY Hit control-escape, F12.

WOMAN Easy for you to say.  You used to model. 
The other WOMEN CUSTOMERS listening nearby nod in agreement. 
TONI Oh yeah, that's true.  Those were the good days.  Sometimes I like to just curl up on the ledge with my box of retouched photos and reminisce about rehab. 
WOMAN Tightly wound today, aren't we? 
TONI I guess.  Must be the coffee talking. 
(handing her a fashion magazine) 
Here, read a fashion magazine.  Feel more insecure about yourself. 
TONI walks through the shop, checks her watch, passes a row of WOMEN getting lunch-hour nail jobs.  BRANDON'S squeezed in among them.  Only guy there.  Cotton between his toes post-pedicure. Hunched and uncomfortable as the WOMEN around him discuss boyfriends and relationships. 
TONI ... Brandon? 
BRANDON Hi. 
TONI I'm Toni.  Walter said you'd stop by. 
BRANDON Nice to meet you. 
(immediately, re: the pedicure) 
This was his idea. 
TONI I know. 
BRANDON He makes all his employees do this? 
TONI Every one. 
BRANDON How often? 
TONI Once.  Before they start work. 
BRANDON Weird. 
TONI You think? 
BRANDON I've never had my nails done before. 
TONI I can see that. 
(putting his hands in water) 
Strong hands.  Nice.  Do you drink? 
BRANDON No thanks.  I'm fine. 
TONI No, do you drink? 
BRANDON Excuse me? 
TONI Alcohol.  Are you a drinker? 
BRANDON I've been pretty focused on staying in shape.  I mean a beer once in a while. 
TONI Smoke? 
BRANDON No. 
Toni 
What about gambling? 
BRANDON What about it? 
TONI Look, I'm sorry, I'm pressed for time. 
(stopping work, regarding him) 
I asked do you bet.  Are you a bettor? 
BRANDON No. 
TONI Really?  Why not? 
BRANDON meets her gaze.  Gears turning.  She's hitting on him. 
BRANDON Toni, huh?  Are you here full-time? 
TONI It's my shop, I better be.  Why don't you gamble? 
BRANDON Well I'll tell you, Toni.  I bet on something once.  Risked everything I had and lost. 
TONI So? 
BRANDON I swore I'd never do it again. 
Toni 
You're sticking to that story?

The chaotic hallway rumbles with beer cups and loud music. VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER's stylish garb clashes with the laid-back dress of the COLLEGE STUDENTS. 
BRAD anxiously hands VERONICA a cup of beer as he watches DAVID and HEATHER CHANDLER move through a staircase door. 
BRAD So, are you a cheerleader? 
VERONICA (dealing with a jerk) No, not at all. BRAD You're pretty enough to be one. 
VERONICA Gee, thanks. 
BRAD It's so great to be able to talk to a girl and not have to ask "What's your major?" I hate that. 
They uncomfortably sip their beers. A deadly pause ensues. 
BRAD So when you go to college, what kind of subjects do you think you'll study? 
INT.   DAVID'S DORM ROOM 
HEATHER CHANDLER and DAVID sit on the latter's bed, surrounded by a Macintosh and a series of obnoxious Ferrari posters. They kiss. DAVID doing most of the work. 
HEATHER CHANDLER Come on David, let's go back to the party. 
DAVID (unzipping his pants) Don't worry, we will. You're just so hot tonight. I can't control myself. 
DAVID pushes HEATHER CHANDLER's head down. 
DORM HALLWAY 
BRAD has given up on conversation. 
BRAD So what do you say we head up to my room and have a real party. I've got the best Windham Hill C.D. collection in the dorm. 
A BIG AMIABLE STUDENT approaches before VERONICA can show disgust. 
BIG AMIABLE STUDENT Brad-man, Robinson's looking for you. He says he owes you for blow and he just got some product himself. 
BRAD You're kidding. That pecker actually scored something on his own? 
BIG AMIABLE STUDENT (ambling off) He's in Sheila's room, guy. Party up. 
BRAD Excellent. Veronica, ever do cocaine? 
VERONICA Ever since Phil Collins did that MTV anti-drug commercial I refuse everything. 
BRAD Phil Collins? Are you sure he isn't drinking and driving? 
VERONICA Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs? 
BRAD Hey, don't run away now. 
With a wink, BRAD squirms off. VERONICA dashes into the room with the coats. 
VERONICA'S BEDROOM 
VERONICA rampages through her diary. 
VERONICA (V.O.) Seventeen is the last year Mom buys the Twinkies. When you make the jump from working weekends at Pizza Hut to thirty years at I.B.M., you lose something. Not innocence--power. 
J.F.K. the cat jumps onto the Diary. 
VERONICA J.F.K.! 
VERONICA flings the screeching cat off and continues. 
VERONICA (V.O.) Christ, I can't explain it, but I'm allowed an understanding that my parents and these Remington University assholes have chosen to ignore. I understand I must stop Heather. 
DORM "COAT" ROOM 
Panting, VERONICA collapses at a desk in the "coat" room. She draws a Vodka bottle from a stockpile of liquor and pours some in her beer cup, slouching down in her chair. 
VERONICA lights a match from a 7-11 matchbook. She eerily brings her hand closer and closer to the fire until it touches. With an eek of pain, she tosses the match away into the Vodka cup, setting it afire. VERONICA laughs to herself before tossing the flaming cup out the window. 
EXT.   ALLEY OUTSIDE THE DORMITORY  NIGHT 
The flaming cup lands in a large rusted garbage can filled with other cups and various refuse. The flames spread... 
INT.   DORMITORY BATHROOM  NIGHT 
A dejected HEATHER CHANDLER walks into a multi-mirror-and-sink bathroom. Using a glass off one of the sinks, she gargles some water and then spits it at her own reflection. 
THE DORM "COAT" ROOM

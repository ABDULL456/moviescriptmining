MRS PARRINGTON No, he's not dead. He's sleeping. He's still sleeping. 
THEO Like sleeping beauty? 
MRS PARRINGTON Yes. That's a good way of looking at it. 
SOPHIE enters. SOPHIE is carrying a cake. 
SOPHIE Sorry. I hope I'm not. 
HARRY No, no. Come in. (Indicating to James to get a chair) James, James. And take the erm... (Refering to cake) SOPHIE Yeah, I heard the news and I really wanted to bake something so I made a Greek Easter cake. Don't ask. 
HARRY No. That's really... lovely. Thank you very much. We'll, we'll have some of that. He's in a mild coma apparently and we have to talk to him and play music and... James, put the... turn the music on. (To SPIROS) Hey, wake up. The accountant's here. You've got to wake up. 
JAMES plays an Ipod in its dock. We hear the first bars of an inappropriate song. 
HARRY (CONT'D) James! (CONTINUED)

THEO Let me do it! 
HARRY Wait! I can felt something. Katie. Get the doctor. 
KATIE I don't want to ask. 
JAMES Oh for fuck's sake, I'll go shall I? 
James exits and fetches a female doctor. 
HARRY Doctor. I felt something just now. A gripping movement. DOCTOR Anything else? 
HARRY No, just a slight squeeze, is that a sign? 
DOCTOR It could be a decorticate response. It's difficult to tell. 
HARRY Right. How long's he going to be like this? 
DOCTOR He's suffered a heart attack. It's hard to predict. You should all take a break. I'm sorry about him.

PHIL (making mental note) No white chocolate. 
RITA There's something so familiar about this. Do you ever have deja vu? Phil smiles. Then Larry enters. 
LARRY (irate, to Rita) I don't believe it. Someone bought every distributor cap in this town. We're going to be stuck here all night1 Over Phil's sympathetic look we hear the song, "I Can't Get Started With You". 
CUT TO: 
INT. THE BERGHOF RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
The music continues over Rita and Phil on the small dance floor. They dance, close, dreamy, romantic. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MAIN STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT 
There is a light snow falling. Phil and Rita are making a little snowman. Somehow the town looks magical tonight-- old fashioned, wholesome. A snowball hits Phil in the back. He and Rita turn around to see a giggling KID. Phil packs a snowball and tosses it. The kid throws one back. Rita and Phil both get into it, packing snowballs and getting into a war with this kid and his little gang of friends. A snowball catches Rita unaware, she slips and goes down in a snowbank. Phil bends down to help her and slips. They are no together, lying in the snow, laughing. Their eyes lock for a long sweet moment, then Rita gets embarrassed and stands up. 
CUT TO: 
EXT . CHERRY STREET INN - NIGHT Phil and Rita are walking slowly, very close. 
PHIL What? 
RITA I ' m just amazed. And I'm not easily amazed. 
PHIL About what? 
RITA How you can start a day with one kind of expectation and end up so completely different. 
PHIL Do you like how this day is turning out? 
RITA Yes. I like it very much. They stop dn front of Phil's hotel. She turns to him. 
RITA You could never have planned a day like this, but it couldn't have been more perfect. 
PHIL You're wrong. I've been planning this day for weeks. Rita ignores the remark and hugs him. Phil tries to kiss her but she gently puts her fingers to his lips, stopping him. \ They enter the bed and breakfast inn. 
INT. VESTIBULE - CONTINUOUS 
Rita hugs him again and starts to exit. 
RITA Thanks. See you tomorrow. 
PHIL Tomorrow? Wait, aren't you going to come up to my room for a while? 
RITA (very reluctant) I don't know, Phil-- 
PHIL NoÂ·reason to end a perfect day. 
RITA 
(DECIDING) Well-- we better not. 
PHIL No, you should. The, uh, the poetry! I've got some books, Rimbaud, Beaudelaire, we could l ig ht a fire-- 
RITA Thanks, but -- 
PHIL (seeing it all slip 
AWAY) Please come, Rita. It'll be -- 
RITA 
(DEFINITE) Phil, I'm tired. We can be together tomorrow. 
PHIL (getting desperate) But there is no tomorrow for me! 
RITA 
(ADAMANT) Let's not ruin it, Phil. There's no way I ' m sleeping with you tonight. 
PHIL Why not? Rita, I love you! 
RITA You don't even know me! 
PHIL (grabs her hand) Please! You have to! Rita shakes loose from his grasp.

KPHX TV - LOBBY - DAY                                      1 \nABBY RICHTER, 30's, pretty, driven and absolutely in control, walks through the lobby, greeting the SECURITY GUARD. \nABBY Morning, Freddy. \nSECURITY GUARD Morning, Abby. Another peaceful day? \nABBY If you say so... \n2   INT. KPHX - CORRIDOR - MORNING - MOMENTS LATER                  2 \nJOY, 40's, the associate producer, falls in step with Abby. \nJOY (panicked) We've got problems. \nABBY There are no problems, Joy.   Only solutions. \nJOY The sky-cam on the traffic copter has a cracked lens and they can't fix it. \nABBY Okay, that's a problem. (thinking, then...) Call Matt Hardwick down at Media Services. He's got a few Sky Cams and he owes me. Now, where are my weathermen? \nJoy opens a door to a waiting area. \n3   INT. KPHX - WAITING AREA - MORNING - CONTINUOUS                 3 \nSeveral portly LATINO MEN look up and wave at Abby. \nLATINO MEN Hey there! \nABBY Hi, guys! \nAbby waves back and closes the door. \n(CONTINUED) 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 3   CONTINUED:                                                         3 \nABBY What's with the pot bellies? \nJOY Research shows people like fat weathermen. It makes them feel safe. \nABBY I like the one in the green and the one in the brown, but I want to see the one in the green with less sideburns and the one in the brown with more, then I'll make my decision. \nLARRY (O.S.) Abby! \nLARRY, 50's, the pompous, uptight anchor man, catches up to them. He wears a makeup bib. \nABBY Morning, Larry. \nLARRY I'm sorry to do this to you, Abby, but I don't think I can work with her anymore. It's bad enough I have to take her criticism at home. I can't do it on air, too. A man can only take so much. \nAbby nods, taking him seriously, but you can tell she's done this before. \nABBY You're not a man, Larry... (off his look) You're a newsman. A newsman isn't defined by the easy times, Larry, he's defined by the difficult ones. Can you imagine Ted Koppel or Chris Hansen or Anderson Cooper having their wives as co-anchor? Hell, no, because they couldn't handle it. But you can. You've got balls the size of Volkswagens. Don't think I haven't noticed. \n(CONTINUED) 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 3   CONTINUED: (2)                                                     3 \nLARRY (re his balls) I've only thought of them as blue as of late, but you're right. They are quite sizeable. But not disproportionately so. (with pride) I like to think of them as aesthetically pleasing -- \nAbby steps away, not wanting to ponder Larry's balls anymore than she has to. \nABBY I think I've made my point. \nLarry nods, appeased, as she reaches the door marked ABBY RICHTER, PRODUCER, \"ALBUQUERQUE A.M.\" She enters and... \n4   INT. KPHX - ABBY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS                                4 \n...walks in on a shouting match between JOSH, a leftist angry news writer, and DORI, the entertainment-leaning co-writer. \nDORI Josh, nobody in Sacramento gives a                              * crap about trees in Alaska! It's not newsworthy. \nJOSH Oh, but full coverage on David Beckham's new tattoo is vital?! \nLarry's wife and co-anchor, GEORGIA, 40 and coiffed to the gills, storms in, followed by the show's GUEST CHEF. \nGEORGIA He's trying to kill me! He knows I can't eat crab, I'm allergic to it! (to the room) Does anyone see this? Is this a hive? \nJOSH It looks like syphilis to me. \nDORI (to Josh) See that? You wouldn't even know what syphilis looks like if it weren't for my story on Paris Hilton. \nJOY What? I'm married. I live vicariously through your dating life. And I really think that this could be our next boyfriend. C'mon, he had nine out of ten items on your checklist. \nABBY Well, technically eight and a half. He said he could cook, but when I pressed him, he was completely unfamiliar with cumin. Don't you think that's a little suspicious? \nOff Joy's look, we CUT TO... \n9    EXT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT - NIGHT                                       9 \nSacramento's nicest restaurant. Diners enter and exit.                    * \n10   INT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT - FOYER - NIGHT                            10 \nAbby approaches the FEMALE HOSTESS, at her podium. \nABBY Hi. I'm looking for a guy with sandy brown hair, athletic build, and blue eyes... he's 5'9 which -- I know what you're thinking -- it's a little short, but he's read The Great Gatsby twice, so we'll just live with it, okay? \nJIM (O.S.) Technically, I'm 5'9 and 3/4. \nShe turns, mortified, to see JIM, 30's and good-looking. Actually, he's better looking in person than in his photo. Abby gulps. \n(CONTINUED) 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 10   CONTINUED:                                                         10 \nJIM (cont'd) But I'll read Gatsby again if that makes it any better. \nABBY Jim -- hey. Hi. Hey. \nHOSTESS Shall I show you to your table? \nAbby and a mildly perturbed Jim follow, clearly not off to a banner start. \n11   INT. RESTAURANT DINING AREA - NIGHT                                11 \nAbby and Jim sit at a table. Abby looks around, tense. \nABBY You know what? This is not the best angle. We should get the table over there. Then we both get a view, instead of one of us looking at the busboy station. \nJIM I'm fine here. \nABBY No, trust me. It'll be better over there. \nHe looks at her like she's crazy, as they get up and move. \n12   ANTOHER TABLE - MOMENTS LATER                                      12 \nThe waiter is now taking their drink order. \nWAITER Can I get you some water for the table? \nJIM Bottle of flat, please. \nABBY You know, they've done studies that show tap water is no different from bottled water. And they passed a law recently to have all restaurants filter their tap water. So, technically it's not tap water.

I mean, just so I can figure it into the overall picture. \nJIM You printed out my profile? \nABBY Actually, my associate producer did. She likes me to be prepared. Not that I'm ever not prepared. Kudos on your comprehensive car insurance policy, by the way. \nJIM That wasn't in my profile. \nABBY No, but it was in your background check. (off his look; changing the subject) So...tell me about yourself. \n(CONTINUED) 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 12   CONTINUED: (2)                                                    12 \nJIM Well, what's left that you don't know? \nABBY Good point. \nThere's an awkward silence between them. She pulls out another piece of paper, and hands it to him. \nABBY I printed out some talking points for us just in case this happened. \nJIM I take it it's happened before? \nABBY No, but since you have nine out of ten of the necessary attributes on my checklist, I just wanted to make sure this goes as smoothly as possible. \nAs Jim processes this, the waiter arrives with drinks. \nJOSH Who the hell is this guy? \n(CONTINUED) 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 22   CONTINUED: (2)                                                    22 \nSTUART His name is Mike Alexander. \nABBY And he's a    quintessential misogynist    uber-moron who represents    everything wrong with television    and society at large... \nDORI I get crap every time I suggest we do something even remotely fluffy and now you're gonna put this douchebag on the air? \nSTUART He's got a point of view. We don't have to like him, we're news people. We're objective. Stone Phillips interviews terrorists, doesn't mean he likes them. It's good for ratings. \nAbby holds up a piece of paper. \nABBY I've got a whole list of ideas on how to improve ratings. We don't need him. \nStuart takes the memo, reading it. \nSTUART A live debate on immigration policy? Never work. \nABBY What are you talking about? Albuquerque is 45% Latino. \nAt this moment, MIKE walks in. Abby stares at him, appalled. \nMIKE Yeah, and as you can tell by all the screaming rugrats in this town, Latino guys like to have a lot of sex. Which means they'd rather listen to me tell them how to bang hot chicks than hear about why they can't bring grandma across the border. (as they all stare at him) (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 22   CONTINUED: (3)                                                    22 MIKE (cont'd) Sorry, I was eavesdropping out in the hall. \nSTUART See, what did I tell you? He's great. \nMIKE Thanks, boss. \nAbby spins to face Stuart. \nABBY You already hired him?! \nMIKE (re Abby) Who's this delightful creature? \nABBY Your superior. \nMIKE Mmm...I like a woman on top. \n23   INT. ABBY'S OFFICE - DAY - MOMENTS LATER                          23 \nAbby is pacing, clearly on the verge of hysteria. \nABBY (chanting) I am an award-winning news producer. I am an award-winning news producer... \nA KNOCK. Then the door opens and Mike appears. \nMIKE Hey, no hard feelings, right? \nABBY You don't even knock? \nMIKE I knocked. I got no response. \nABBY So, essentially your knock was negated by your complete lack of adherence to the social etiquette of what follows a knock. \n(CONTINUED) 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 23   CONTINUED:                                                        23 \nMIKE Wow. You are wound like a fuckin' top. \nAbby glares at him. \nABBY Woof woof.     Recognize the bark? \nHe stares at her, surprised. \nMIKE (then; realizing) Hey, what do you know? You're not ugly at all. \nABBY Imagine my relief. \nMIKE You know, if it weren't for you, I would have never gotten this gig. You and I make good TV. \nABBY I'm sorry, what channel is your show on? \nMIKE Eighty three. \nABBY This is channel two. You do know that the lower numbers are better, right? More people watch. So don't tell me that \"you and I\" make good TV. I am an award-winning news producer. I make good TV. You make imbecilic trash watched by housebound inbreds who are so busy putting their hands down their pants they're unable to change the channel. \nMIKE I hadn't really been picturing you that way, but thanks for the image. \nABBY Let me tell you something. I am not one of your viewers. My cat stepped on the remote. \n(CONTINUED) 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 23   CONTINUED: (2)                                                    23 \nMIKE Thank your pussy for me, then. \nAbby gags as she pushes past him and walks out. \n24   INT. KPHX - HALLWAY - DAY                                         24 \nLARRY That's not my fault! \nMIKE I know, it's her fault! \nGEORGIA Why is it my fault?! \nIn the control room, Abby looks like she's going to pass out. \nABBY Oh, dear God. \nGEORGIA Well, what am I supposed to do, give up the money, so he can get an erection? \nMIKE I agree. You've economically emasculated your husband to such a point that he's afraid to desire you. Sure, you can dump his ass, but honey, have you seen the eligible men in Albuquerque? It's slim pickings out there for a woman in her forties. You're not going to do any better than Larry. You just have to let him be a man. LET HIM BE A MAN, GEORGIA!

Now! \nLarry grabs Georgia and kisses her hard. After a moment of resistance, she melts into his arms. The crew goes crazy. Larry throws Georgia over his back and hauls her off the set. \nAbby sinks down into a chair.                                          * \nCLIFF And we're out. \nHe cuts to BLACK. \n27   INT. KPHX - ABBY'S OFFICE - DAY                                   27 \nIt's pitch black. Suddenly a closet door is opened. Joy and Stuart stand in the doorway. \nJOY Found her. \nAbby is sitting in a ball in her closet. \nSTUART One thousand, one hundred and forty- seven calls and over three hundred E-mails. And fifty-three percent of them were women. This guy's a lightening rod! \nABBY (confused) People liked him?! \nSTUART Liked him? They loved him. \nABBY How is that possible? \nSTUART I don't know, but I'm scaling back the news and giving it to \"The Ugly Truth.\" Corporate wants five minutes of Mike Alexander, five days a week. \nABBY Stuart, I really think this is a mistake -- \n(CONTINUED) 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 27   CONTINUED:                                                          27 \nSTUART Just keep him happy and both of our contracts will be renewed. \nStuart leaves. Joy turns back to Abby. \nJOY Congratulations? \nAbby closes the closet door on herself. \n28   INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY- DAY                              28 * \nMike enters his apartment, throws his keys on the counter and hits play on his answering machine. \nGIRL'S VOICE (V.O.) Hey, Mike, it's Valerie. I haven't heard from you in a while. But I just saw you on TV. You were great! \nHe pushes skip. \n2ND GIRL'S VOICE (V.O.) Mike, hi, it's Ginevra, I'm having a party -- \nSkip. \n3RD GIRL'S VOICE (V.O.) Why haven't you called me? I miss you. It's Laura, by the way. Remember? We went to the track? \nMIKE Remember? How could I forget? You threw up in my car. \nJONAH, 14, awkward, Mike's nephew, walks in. \nJONAH Dude, you totally hosed me! \nMIKE What? \nJONAH Last week on your show, you said you should always be mean to hot girls because they'll want you more. I tried it today, she cried, and then I got detention. \n(CONTINUED) 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 28   CONTINUED:                                                        28 \nMIKE First of all - don't listen to what I say on my show. Second of all, you're supposed to do that to 25- year-old girls who think they're hot and can get any guy they want. Not 14-year-old girls. They're going through puberty. They have enough problems. \nJONAH Mom said when she was fourteen, she was the prettiest girl in the class. \nMIKE Well, I was there when she was fourteen and let me tell you something -- she lied. \nMike's sister, ELIZABETH, 40's, walks in, wearing a nurse's uniform and holding a cake box. \nELIZABETH Don't listen to your Uncle Mike, he was blind from masturbating too much. \nMIKE Oh, that's a nice thing to tell your son -- \nHe picks up a copy of \"Ulysses\" from the table. \n(CONTINUED) 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 30   CONTINUED: (2)                                                    30 \nMIKE (CONT'D) Now, if you'll follow me we have something quite different... \nHe starts to walk off the set. \n31   INT. KPHX - CONTROL ROOM - DAY - SAME TIME                        31 \nNow in the control room, Abby panics. \nCLIFF                                              * Where the hell is he going?! \nABBY                                               * Follow him! \n32   EXT.

Don't we have security? \nIN THE ALLEY, a security guard watches the girls, smitten. \nMike smiles to the camera. \nMIKE Babes wrestling in Jello. Let's just take a quick survey and see which option the men out there would pick. \nABBY Do we have phone lines?      Open them!                      * \nMIKE Beethoven, stuffed pheasant and                              * James Joyce -- or semi-naked chicks frolicking in strawberry-flavored goo. \n(CONTINUED) 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 32   CONTINUED:                                                        32 \nAs Abby looks horrified, the PHONES in the control room start RINGING off the hook. Realizing her defeat, Abby sighs. \nABBY Jesus, if we're gonna do this, we might as well milk it. (then; into headset) Two, go wide! Good. Ready, one -- tight on his hand! \nAbby grabs the microphone for Mike's ear piece... \nABBY Lick the Jello off her finger! \nON THE MONITOR -- A slightly puzzled look from Mike, but he lifts the girl's finger and licks the Jello off it. \nABBY (COMT'D) (into headset) Go one! \nThe camera focuses tightly on his face. \nMIKE Mmmm...I was wrong. It's cherry. And that's the ugly truth. Over to you, Georgia. \nAs Mike waves to camera, he's pulled into the Jello pool and the girls rip off his shirt. \n33   INT.

Confused by her reaction, he follows. \n(CONTINUED) 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 33   CONTINUED:                                                        33 \nMIKE C'mon, we were a good team back there. You were the one who told me to lick the Jello. \nABBY Do you have any idea how much I hate myself for that?! It was cheap titillation. I am now going to broadcasting hell right behind Geraldo and the naked weather girl from Canada. \nMIKE Seriously? There's a naked weather girl? Can we get her? \n34   INT.

While Mike tries to concentrate     on the game, but the guys are more interested in reading his     fan mail. \nDWAYNE (reading) \"Dear Mike, I know I'm the girl who can change you and make you fall in love. Here's a photo of me and my iguana.\" \nSteve looks at the photo. \nSTEVE I thought iguanas only liked dry places. \nHe passes it to Gary. \nGARY We might need to call animal control on this one. \nMIKE Guys, enough with the fan mail. \nSTEVE What? You don't want to add her into your rotation? \n(CONTINUED) 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 38   CONTINUED:                                                        38 \nMIKE Uh, no. \nDWAYNE What about the tranny?

COLIN'S CONDO - NIGHT                                        39 \nUnpacked boxes are stacked everywhere. Classical music plays on the stereo. Colin, now in sweats and a t-shirt, examines Abby's ankle. \nABBY (impressed) You're a doctor? \nCOLIN An orthopedic surgeon. \nShe glances around the room and sees a bottle of red wine and a half empty wine glass sitting on a table. \nCOLIN I do a lot of leg and hip stuff but I do get the occasional foot. You seem to be fine. No sprain. \nABBY Well, I guess I'm pretty lucky D'Artagnan picked your tree to climb. Dave in the next unit over sells lawn furniture.

You know. \nAbby looks at him, nodding. Delighted at his complete and utter perfection. \nABBY Well, I guess I should get going now. \nShe remains rooted to her spot. He waits a beat then, feeling awkward, makes a move to open the door. \nABBY (CONT'D) Thanks again for saving me. \nCOLIN Any time. \nShe walks out and Colin closes the door. Realizing that he still has the cat in his arms, he opens the door to find -- \nAbby doing a SPAZZY HAPPY DANCE.

Everything okay? \nWe INTERCUT. \nABBY Couldn't be better. I just wanted to call and tell you how much I enjoyed meeting you. \nMike picks up the extension and listens in. Abby glares at him, but she can't stop him. \nCOLIN Oh, thanks. \nABBY So... I was just thinking that we should have dinner. \nCOLIN (not great) Oh... great. \nMike shakes his head, knowing where this is going. \nABBY There's this new French Bistro that got fantastic reviews and there's a gallery opening in Old Town on Friday.

He was blowing you off. \nABBY He was not. \nShe moves to pick up the phone. Mike sits on the phone to stop her. \nMIKE Don't! He'll be expecting you to call him back. When you don't, he'll call you. \nABBY How do you know? \nMIKE Because I know men. If you want it to work out with this guy, you'll listen to me and do exactly as I say. You already did irreparable damage with your psycho-aggressive control freak phone call. It might even be too late. Even if you do salvage the situation, you'll probably never be more than Abby, his desperate neighbor. \nABBY I'm not desperate!

Never criticize. \nABBY Even if it's constructive? \nMIKE Never. Men are incapable of growth, change or progress. For men, self- improvement ends at toilet- training. Rule number two. Laugh at whatever he says. \nABBY What if what he's saying isn't funny? \nMIKE That's irrelevant. A fake laugh is like a fake orgasm. \nABBY And a fake orgasm is good? \nMIKE No, but a fake orgasm is better than no orgasm at all. \nABBY A fake orgasm is no orgasm. \n(CONTINUED) 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 48   CONTINUED:                                                    48 \nMIKE Only to you.

When we ask you how you're doing, it's just guy code for \"let me put my dick in your ass.\" \nABBY Okay, I'm trying to decide whether I should just walk away right now, or run. \nMIKE I know you think Colin is above it all, but he's a guy. If he's even remotely into you, he's thought about each one of your orifices at least ten times. \nABBY I love how you assume every man is as perverse as you are. \nMIKE I don't assume. I know.

Try to find lust instead. It's a lot easier and a lot less messy. Blue balls only last a few hours. A broken heart can last years. \nThe audience reacts with hollers and cheers. Abby shakes her head. \nJAY So, what's her name? \nMIKE Who? \nJAY The girl who screwed you up. She must have been a doozy. \nMike looks a bit taken aback, but recovers quickly. \nMIKE Like I said, better a floozy than a doozy. \nAbby cocks her head, intrigued by Mike's reaction. \nJAY Well, what do you say to guys like me who have been happily married for twenty-seven years? We can't be the exception to the rule, can we? There's plenty of us out there. \nMIKE Well, Jay, let me tell ya -- \nHe hesitates, then looks at Abby for a moment. She gives him an encouraging nod.

By year twenty, you've learned to completely tune out the sound of her voice and it occurs to you that ever since you walked down the aisle, you're living with someone who can barely tolerate your presence and, on the rare occasion that you actually do make love, she probably thinks about Jake Gyllenhaal. \nJay looks stricken, going along with the bit. \nJAY You're right.

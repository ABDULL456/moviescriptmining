{"train": "THE FAULT IN OUR STARS \nWritten by \nScott Neustadter & Michael H. Weber \nBased on the novel by \nJohn Green \nMay 1, 2012 \nFIRST DRAFT \nHAZEL GRACE LANCASTER (16) lies in the grass, staring up at the stars. We're CLOSE ON her FACE and we hear: \nHAZEL (V.O.) You have a choice in this world, I believe, about how to tell sad stories. \nCUT TO a SERIES OF QUICK IMAGES: - Hazel and the BOY we will come to know as AUGUSTUS \"GUS\" WATERS (17) at an outdoor restaurant in some magical place. [They look very much like the perfect Hollywood couple.] \nHAZEL (V.O.) On the one hand, you can sugar coat - the way they do in movies and romance novels. \n- \"Perfect\" Hazel and \"Perfect\" Gus sit on a BENCH overlooking an incredible seascape in some foreign country. She rests her head on his shoulder. \nHAZEL (V.O.) Where villains are vanquished and... heroes are born and... - \"Perfect\" Hazel and \"Perfect\" Gus kiss in a dark room. \nHAZEL (V.O.) ... beautiful people learn beautiful lessons... \n- \"Perfect\" Hazel and \"Perfect\" Gus fall onto a bed together. They look deep into one another's eyes. \nHAZEL (V.O.) ... and nothing is too messed up that can't be fixed with an apology and a Peter Gabriel song. \nBACK TO Hazel on the grass, still watching the stars. Were those dreams or were they memories? Still unclear. \nHAZEL (V.O.) I like that way as much as the next girl, believe me. It's just not the truth. \nHazel closes her eyes. \nHAZEL (V.O.) This is the truth. And EVERYTHING GOES BLACK. We HEAR: \nHAZEL (V.O.) Sorry. \nFADE IN ON: \nINT DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY The real Hazel is no less beautiful than the one we just saw. \nHAZEL (V.O.) Late in the Winter of my 17th year... \nThere are, however, some key and obvious differences. First, you'll notice the OXYGEN TUBE in her nostrils which help her to breathe. \nSecond, you'll notice her hair - which we couldn't see in the grass. It's much shorter than the \"Perfect\" version, the result of someone whose head was completely shaved a few years before. \nHAZEL (V.O.) ... my mother decided I was depressed. \nHAZEL I'm not depressed. \nHazel's legs dangle over the side of an exam table. Her mother FRANNIE (early 40s, younger than she feels) explains to the DOCTOR: \nFRANNIE ... she eats like a bird. She barely leaves the house, \nHAZEL I'm not depressed. \nFRANNIE ... she reads the same book over and over... \nDOCTOR She's depressed. \nHAZEL I'm not depressed! \nOff her look, CUT TO: QUICK SEQUENCE, which play over: \nSPEAKER #2 Angel. 17. Ewing sarcoma. \nPATRICK Patrick. 34. Testicular. It started a few years ago, when I was... As Hazel watches, bored, and Patrick continues, we hear: \nHAZEL (V.O.) I'll spare you the gory details of Patrick's ball cancer. Basically, they found it in his nuts, cut most of it out, he almost died, but he didn't die, and now here he is - divorced, friendless, addicted to video games, exploiting his cancertastic past in the heart of Jesus - \"literally\" - to show us that one day - if we're lucky - we could be just like him. They all say: \nALL IN UNISON \"We're here for you Patrick.\" Hazel says it the least enthusiastically. She locks eyes with her only friend in Support Group, a blonde kid with an eye patch, ISAAC. He's also shaking his head. \nPATRICK Who else would like to share? \n(NO RESPONSE) Hazel? Oh no. Patrick gestures for her to speak. Reluctantly she stands, sighs... \nHAZEL I'm, uh, Hazel. 16. \n(BEAT) Thyroid originally but with quite the impressive satellite colony in my lungs. Not much more to say, Hazel is about to sit down. \nPATRICK And how are you doing Hazel? Hazel has no idea how to answer that. \nHAZEL (V.O.) You mean besides the terminal cancer? \nBut that's not what she says. She says: \nHAZEL Alright? I guess...? Isaac tries not to laugh at this. Hazel sits back down. \nALL IN UNISON \"We're here for you Hazel.\" Hazel exhales. This is not at all helpful. A few more beats. \nPATRICK Maybe now I'll play a song... \nEXT CHURCH - LATER Frannie sits in the car in the parking lot, reading from a book, waiting for Group to be over. She sees the church door open and puts the book away. Hazel comes out. Frannie looks at her like \"well, was it great?\" Hazel just exhales and gets in the car. CUT TO: \nINT HAZEL'S LIVING ROOM - ANOTHER DAY \"America's Next Top Model\" is on the TV. Hazel sits on one side of the L-shaped couch, flipping through her novel. Frannie and Hazel's dad MICHAEL (40s, kind, doing his best to stay positive) sit on the other side, watching her - but trying not to make it seem that way. After a few beats: \nFRANNIE It's Friday night. \nHAZEL Hmm? \nFRANNIE I was just thinking... you should call your friends, see what they're up to. \nHAZEL \n(DISINTERESTED) That's ok. Frannie and Michael look at one another, don't say anything. \nMICHAEL Wanna see a movie? Hazel looks up from the book. Sees her parents. Gets an idea. \nHAZEL Why don't you guys go to a movie? (off their look) \n(MORE) \nHAZEL (CONT'D) You haven't been out in a while. Go. Have fun. Take the night off. Frannie and Michael look at one another again. \nMICHAEL This is a really good show. Hazel sighs. And just like that, everyone goes back to what they were doing. CUT TO: QUICK SEQUENCE, which plays over: \nHAZEL (V.O.) And that was my life. - Hazel watching TV, book in hand. - Hazel in another doctor's office. - Hazel popping pills. \nHAZEL (V.O.) Reality shows. Doctor's appointments. Eight prescription drugs, three times a day. \nINT HAZEL'S KITCHEN - ANOTHER DAY Hazel and her parents in the kitchen. \nHAZEL (V.O.) And worse worse worst of all... support group. \nHAZEL Ugh. You can't make me. \nMICHAEL Of course we can, we're your parents. Hazel frowns. \nMICHAEL Hazel, you need to get out of the house. Make friends. Be a teenager. \nHAZEL If you want me to be a teenager, don't send me to Support Group. Buy me a fake ID so I can go to clubs and drink gimlets and take pot. \nMICHAEL You don't take pot. \nPATRICK And how are you feeling Augustus? \nGUS Me? Oh I'm grand. I'm on a roller coaster that only goes up, my friend. Hazel smiles. Gus catches this. Embarrassed, she stops smiling and looks away. \nPATRICK Perhaps you'd like to share your fears with the group, Augustus. \nGUS My fears? Gus thinks about this. \nGUS Oblivion. \nPATRICK Oblivion? ANGLE ON Hazel, intrigued. \nGUS Yeah, see... I intend to live an extraordinary life. To be remembered. If I'm scared of anything it's... not doing that. Patrick doesn't quite have the tools to deal with that. \nPATRICK Would, uh, anyone like to speak to that? And Hazel's hand goes up. Even Patrick is surprised by that. \nPATRICK Hazel! That's unexpected. Hazel stands, takes a second to gather her thoughts. Augustus watches her, waits for it. \nHAZEL I just wanna say... there will come a time when, you know, all of us are dead. Gus is now even more fixed on her than before. \nHAZEL It might be tomorrow. Might be a million years from now but... it's gonna happen. And when it does, enough generations will come and go, there'll be no one left to remember Cleopatra. Or Mozart. Or Muhammad Ali, let alone any of us, right? The look on Gus's face is unreadable. \nHAZEL Oblivion's inevitable. And if that scares you, well, I suggest you ignore it. God knows it's what everyone else does. A beat. And then an enormous smile spreads across Gus's face, not a flirty smile but a surprised one, a real one. CUT TO: \nEXT OUTSIDE THE CHURCH - LATER Hazel waits for her Mom's car to appear. Across the parking lot, she sees Isaac going at it with a redhead, MONICA (17), sucking face like there's no tomorrow against the door of her green Pontiac Firebird. Between kisses, we can hear: \nISAAC MONICA Always. Always. \nAnd Hazel hears: \nGUS Literally. Hazel turns to find the Beautiful Boy, Augustus, standing right next to her. \nGUS I thought we were in a church basement but apparently we were literally in the heart of Jesus. Hazel smiles. \nHAZEL Someone should probably tell him, don't you think? Jesus? Seems kinda dangerous keeping all these kids with cancer in your heart. Gus laughs. \nGUS What's your name? \nHAZEL Hazel. \nGUS No your full name? \nHAZEL \n(CONFUSED) Hazel Grace Lancaster. Gus nods to himself, smiles. Still fixated on her. \nHAZEL What? \nGUS I didn't say anything. \nHAZEL Why are you looking at me like that? \nGUS Because you're beautiful. Hazel is taken aback. No one's ever said that to her before. \nGUS I enjoy looking at beautiful people and I decided a while back not to deny myself the simpler pleasures of existence. Particularly given that, as you so astutely pointed out, we're all gonna die pretty soon. \nHAZEL \n(BEAT) I'm not beaut -- A CUTE YOUNG GIRL walks past them. \nYOUNG GIRL Hey Gus. \nGUS Hey Alisa. Hazel isn't surprised that other girls know Gus. Of course they do. She turns back towards Isaac and Monica pawing at each other. She hears: \nISAAC MONICA Always. Always. \nHAZEL What's with the \"always?\" \nGUS \"Always\" is their thing. They'll \"always\" love each other and whatnot. Must have texted \"always\" to each other at least four million times this year. They continue to watch the show. It's pretty gross. Isaac squeezes Monica's breast like a clown horn. \nGUS So what happened to you? Hazel takes a deep breath. She's told this story before but somehow this seems different. \nHAZEL I was 13 when they found it. And as she speaks, we see it unfold. SMASH CUT TO: \nINT HOSPITAL BED - FLASHBACK 13-YEAR OLD HAZEL has a biopsy. \nHAZEL (V.O.) Stage IV thyroid cancer. \nINT OPERATING ROOM - FLASHBACK 13-YEAR OLD HAZEL on the operating table. It's a nightmare. \nHAZEL (V.O.) I had surgery first. \nINT SEVERAL MORE HOSPITAL ROOMS - FLASHBACK This poor little girl is taking a beating. And it's just getting started. - Radiation treatment. \nHAZEL (V.O.) Then Radiation... - Having her head shaved by Frannie. \nHAZEL (V.O.) Then Chemo... - With a PICC line in a chemo chair. \nHAZEL (V.O.) All of which worked for a while. - A RADIOLOGIST looks at an X-ray. He's not pleased. \nHAZEL (V.O.) And then stopped working. - 14-Year Old Hazel lies in bed, struggling to breathe. Frannie runs her fingers through her hair. Dad calls 9-1-1. \nHAZEL (V.O.) And then my lungs started filling up with water. - In the ICU, her parents standing over her. \nHAZEL (V.O.) That should have been the end. \nFRANNIE (through the tears) Are you ready, sweetie? 14-Year Old Hazel nods. Michael can't keep it together any longer. He completely breaks down. \nHAZEL (V.O.) But it wasn't. \nINT ICU - THE NEXT MORNING The sun shines in the room. 14-year old Hazel eats ice chips, the color has returned to her cheeks. \nHAZEL (V.O.) The antibiotics kicked in. They drained the fluid from my lungs. And in time I got better. Stronger. \nINT YET ANOTHER HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY Slightly older Hazel is getting more intravenous medication. It's never ending. \nHAZEL (V.O.) I even found myself in an experimental trial. You know the ones that are famous in the Republic of Cancervania for not working. - A SECOND RADIOLOGIST examines a second X-ray. \nHAZEL (V.O.) It's called Phalanxifor. Didn't work in over 70 percent of patients but, for some reason... The Radiologist looks surprised. \nHAZEL (V.O.) ...it worked in me. They called it \"The Miracle.\" And finally, BACK TO: \nINT GUS'S CAR - SAME Gus has one eye on the road, the other on Hazel. He was impressed with her before. He's totally dazzled now. \nHAZEL Tumors shrank, my mets have hardly grown since... \n(MORE) \nHAZEL (CONT'D) Of course my lungs still suck but, theoretically, they could continue to suck in just this way for, I dunno, a while maybe. \nGUS Wow. \nHAZEL Yeah. \nGUS So are you back in school or...? \nHAZEL Can't. \nGUS Why not? \nHAZEL Got my GED. \nGUS A college girl! Well that explains the aura of sophistication... He smiles at her. She smiles back. Shoves his upper arm playfully. They're easing into each other. Eventually Gus's car pulls into his driveway. \nGUS We're here. He's as good at parking as he is at driving. CUT TO: \nEXT/INT GUS'S HOUSE - SAME Hazel follows Gus inside. She quickly notices all sorts of engraved plaques and framed signs with phrases like \"Home is Where the Heart Is\" and \"True Love is Born from Hard Times.\" Hazel looks at Gus quizzically. \nGUS My parents call them \"encouragements.\" (rolling his eyes) Don't ask. Gus's MOM and DAD (40s) are in the kitchen making dinner. \nHAZEL It's not, it's... kind of my bible actually. \nGUS Interesting. What's it about? \nHAZEL Cancer. (off his look) But not in that way, trust me. The guy who wrote it, Peter Van Houten, he's... well, the only person I've ever come across who seems to a) understand what it's like to be dying and b) not have died. \nGUS \n(INTRIGUED) In that case... I am going to read this horrible book with the boring title that does not contain zombies or stormtroopers. And in exchange... Gus pulls a book from his bookshelf. \nGUS ... all I ask is that you read this brilliant and haunting novelization of my favorite video game. Hazel looks at the slim, ridiculous novella. She laughs. She's adorable when she laughs. She takes the book from him and as she does, their hands get tangled together for a brief, charged moment. \nGUS Your hands are cold. \nHAZEL Not so much cold as under- oxygenated. \nGUS Ooh Hazel Grace... \n(BEAT) I love it when you talk medical to me. Hazel blushes. And off her completely smitten smile, CUT TO: \nINT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - ANOTHER NIGHT Hazel sits in bed reading Gus's novella. Frannie stands in the doorway, notices the new book. \nFRANNIE That's different. Hazel shrugs. Frannie looks intrigued. \nFRANNIE Did he give it to you? \nHAZEL By \"it\" do you mean herpes? Frannie rolls her eyes. Hazel's phone buzzes. She excitedly checks it - only to be disappointed. Frannie notices. \nFRANNIE I'm sure he'll call, don't worry. \nHAZEL I'm not worried. Please. It's not like I'm waiting for him to call or anything. I just... we hung out. No big deal. Frannie says nothing to that. Her silence says it all. Hazel rolls her eyes. CUT TO: \nQUICK SERIES OF SCENES: Hazel continues \"not to wait\" for Gus's call. We see her: - Brushing her teeth. And checking her phone. - Watching TV. And checking her phone. - Eating breakfast. And checking her phone. - Looking out the window on a rainy day. Trying not to check her phone. Willing herself to not check the goddamn phone. And checking the phone. Where is he?! Did he forget about her? \nINT HAZEL'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT Hazel at the dinner table with her parents. She's a little sullen, barely touching her food. Hazel's phone buzzes. She tries not to seem too eager to check it, what with her parents watching and all. She subtly looks down at her lap. And sure enough: a text from Gus! Her eyes bug out. We see: \n\"Tell me my copy is missing the last ten pages or something.\" Hazel smiles. Goes back to eating. Frannie and Michael share a quick glance. A second later, there's a follow-up text. \"Tell me I have NOT reached the end of this book!\" Hazel smiles again. And then a third text: \n\"A BOOK CAN\"T END IN THE MIDDLE OF A SENTENCE?! WHAT IN GOD'S \nNAME IS THIS MADNESS! AAAAHHHH!\" Hazel now laughs out loud. Michael clears his throat. Hazel looks up. \nMICHAEL Would you like to be excused? \nEXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER Hazel sits down on a patio chair and dials the phone. Gus answers on the first ring. \nGUS (O.S.) Hazel Grace. \nHAZEL Welcome to the sweet torture of reading \"An Imperial --\" At which point she hears a loud WAIL coming from the other end of the phone. \nHAZEL What the -- are you ok? \nGUS (O.S.) Me? Yeah. I'm excellent. INTERCUT between Hazel on the patio and: \nINT GUS'S BASEMENT BEDROOM - SAME Isaac's head is buried in Gus's couch. He's wailing like a banshee, having some kind of nervous breakdown. \nGUS \n(INTO PHONE) I am, however, with Isaac. Hazel hears more wailing. Has no idea what to make of it. \nGUS (O.S.) \n(TO ISAAC) Dude! Hey! Does Support Group Hazel make this better or worse? Hazel genuinely has no idea what the hell is going on. \nGUS Isaac! Focus. On. Me. Hazel waits a few beats for Gus to come back on. Finally: \nGUS (O.S.) \n(TO HAZEL) How fast can you get here? Hazel thinks about this. And on her face, CUT TO: \n(BEAT) Hang on. (turns to Isaac) Isaac! Gus stands and takes the pillow out of Isaac's hand. \nGUS Pillows don't break. Gus hands Isaac one of his basketball TROPHIES. \nGUS You need to break something. Isaac looks at it, then back to Gus as if asking permission. Gus nods. Isaac holds it over his head and SMASH! The trophy breaks into a million pieces. Isaac almost smiles. Gus hands him another. \nGUS Go to town, my friend. And Isaac does. Smashing them one by one. Hazel looks at Gus. \nGUS I've been looking for a way to tell my Dad that I kinda hate basketball. Think maybe we've found it. Isaac grabs more of the TROPHIES, smashing them to pieces. Gus and Hazel enjoy the spectacle. When there are none left Isaac is panting, standing over the bronze carnage. \nGUS Feel better? Isaac thinks about it. Shakes his head no. Gus puts his arm around him but looks at Hazel. \nGUS That's the thing about pain... it demands to be felt. Hazel smiles. And on her face, we CUT TO: \nINT LANCASTER HOUSE - DINING ROOM - ANOTHER NIGHT Where Hazel is having dinner with her parents. \nFRANNIE Dr. Maria called today. The PET Scan is set for the eighth. Hazel nods. This could be a source of worry but she's not going to think about that right now. She's upbeat. And she's actually eating, which her parents can't help but notice. Frannie and Michael look at one another, pleased. \nFRANNIE I told you Support Group was a good idea. Hazel's phone buzzes. \"Augustus.\" She looks to her parents. \nMICHAEL By all means. \nEXT HAZEL'S BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER Hazel lays on the grass in her backyard staring up at the stars. She rings him back and as she does SPLITSCREEN w/ Hazel in the grass and: \nINT GUS'S BASEMENT BEDROOM - SAME Gus (upside down) in bed, a laptop on his chest. \nGUS Hazel Grace. \nHAZEL Hello Augustus. \nGUS So I read it again. And I just kept feeling like... like it was a gift. Like you'd given me something important. \nHAZEL \n(TOUCHED) You're welcome. \nGUS On the other hand... we need closure, don't we? \nHAZEL What we need is a sequel. \nGUS Yes. We need to know what happens to Anna's family after she dies. \nHAZEL That's what I kept asking Van Houten for in my letters. \nGUS But he never wrote back. \nHAZEL That's correct. \nGUS Because he's a recluse. \nHAZEL Yeee-up. \nGUS Utterly unreachable. \nHAZEL Unfortunately so. Gus clears his throat, smiles. Hazel waits. \nGUS \"Dear Mr. Waters... I am writing to thank you for your electronic correspondence received this 6th of April. Hazel sits up. Could it be...? \nGUS \"I am grateful to anyone who sets aside the time to read my book...\" \nHAZEL Augustus!? \nGUS I found his assistant. I emailed her. She must have forwarded it to him. (Hazel is stunned) Shall I continue? \nHAZEL Keep reading, keep reading! \nGUS \"I am particularly indebted to you, sir, both for your kind words about `An Imperial Affliction' and for taking the time to tell me that the book, and here I quote you directly, `meant a great deal' to you.\" Hazel pays attention to every word. \nGUS \"To answer your question: No, I have not written anything else, nor will I. I do not feel that continuing to share my thoughts with readers would benefit either them or me. However thank you again for your generous email. Yours most sincerely, Peter Van Houten. \nMICHAEL That's fantastic. \nGUS I'm very lucky. ANGLE ON Hazel, checking herself out in the mirror. Seems to like what she sees a lot more than before. BACK ON Gus and Michael, downstairs: \nMICHAEL Son, you have to understand... Hazel's still pretty sick. She will be the rest of her life. ANGLE on Hazel, who can hear all of this. She stops what she's doing and listens. \nMICHAEL She'll want to keep up with you - she's that kind of girl - but the truth is, her lungs -- \nHAZEL You ready Gus? Hazel appears, silencing her Father mid-sentence. CUT TO: \nEXT PARK - LATER Behind the Indianapolis Museum of Art is 152 Acres of Gardens and Grounds. Hazel and Gus walk together. \nHAZEL Is this where you bring all your romantic conquests? \nGUS Every last one. \n(BEAT) Probably why I'm still a virgin. Hazel laughs, elbows him. \nHAZEL You're not a virgin. (off his look) Are you really? Gus picks a STICK up from the dirt. Draws a BIG CIRCLE in it. \nGUS See this? This circle is virgins... Now Gus draws a much smaller circle inside that circle. \nGUS And this... is 17 year old dudes with one leg. Hazel laughs. Point made. He grabs her hand, helps her walk up a tiny hill. Once up there, Gus lays a blanket on the ground. They sit, looking out over a rather odd SCULPTURE - a set of GIANT WHITE BONES where children can jump and play. \nGUS \n(EXPLAINING) \"Funky Bones\" by Joep Van Lieshout. \nHAZEL He sounds Dutch. \nGUS And he is. Much like Rik Smits. And tulips. Hazel raises an eyebrow at Gus. He's sure taking this Amsterdam/Dutch thing pretty far. He removes some sandwiches and orange juice out of a basket. \nGUS Sandwich? \nHAZEL Let me guess -- \nGUS \n(NODS) Dutch cheese. And tomato. (she takes one) The tomatoes are Mexican. Sorry. They eat for a second, their eyes watching the children play on the bones. \nGUS How cool is that? A skeleton being used as a playground. \nHAZEL You do love your symbols. \nGUS Speaking of which... Gus stands up, takes a cigarette, puts it in his mouth. He clears his throat. \nGUS You're probably wondering why you're sitting here eating a bad cheese sandwich and drinking orange juice with a guy in a Rik Smits jersey. \nHAZEL It has crossed my mind. \nGUS Hazel Grace, like so many before you - and I say this with great affection - you spent your Wish... moronically. \nHAZEL I was thir-- \nGUS Hush! I'm in the midst of a grand soliloquy here. \nHAZEL Sorry. Please, continue... \nGUS You were young. Impressionable. The Grim Reaper staring you in the face. And the fear of dying with your one true Wish left ungranted led you to rush into making one you didn't really want, for how could little Hazel Grace, having never read \"An Imperial Affliction\" ever know that her one TRUE wish was to visit Mr. Peter Van Houten in his Amsterdamian exile. Hazel nods in agreement. \nGUS If you were smart, you would have saved your wish til the time in your life when you really knew your true self. \nGus stops talking. Hazel is confused. \nHAZEL But I... didn't save it. Gus smiles. \nGUS Good thing I saved mine. Hazel cocks her head to one side. What is he talking about? \nGUS Got it in exchange for the leg. \nHAZEL (V.O.) I'd been poked and stabbed and poisoned for years and still I trod on. \nINT EMERGENCY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER Michael carries Hazel into the chaotic emergency room. They're practically running. There's still no sound. \nHAZEL (V.O.) But make no mistake... The doctors rally to assist the screaming, crying child. She's wheeled away from her family who can only watch. We stay with her and WE HEAR: \nHAZEL (V.O.) In that moment I would have been very, very happy to die. \nEND SEQUENCE. \nINT HOSPITAL ROOM - ICU - MORNING The sound returns. And it's the sound of a heart monitor. BEEP. BEEP. BEEP. It's also the sound of a working heart. Hazel has made it through. Her eyes open. A NURSE is there. \nHAZEL'S NURSE Hello. \nHAZEL Hi. \nHAZEL'S NURSE You're ok, Hazel. Even Hazel seems surprised by that. \nHAZEL'S NURSE Would you like to see your parents? Hazel nods. The Nurse goes to get them. Soon they come bounding in, crying and kissing her repeatedly. So much relief. CUT TO: LATER. Hazel's bed has been raised up so she can talk to her parents \"comfortably.\" \nFRANNIE They thought it was a brain tumor. \nMICHAEL It wasn't - thank god -- \nHAZEL So what happened? \nFRANNIE The usual. Fluid in the lungs, preventing oxygenation. They put that in... There's a TUBE in Hazel's side draining fluid into a plastic bladder that hangs off her bed. \nFRANNIE Drained a liter and a half last night. (That's a lot of fluid.) \nMICHAEL The good news is... no tumor growth. No new tumors in your body. Hazel nods. That is a relief. \nMICHAEL We're all so relieved. Frannie embraces her daughter. \nFRANNIE This is just a thing Hazel. It's a thing we can live with. Hazel nods again. Only in the universe of Hazel Grace Lancaster is something like this just a thing. Meanwhile: \nINT HOSPITAL ICU - WAITING AREA - LATER Here's Gus, his foot tapping nervously on the floor. It's unclear how long he's been waiting there. He sees Michael walk down the hall. Races after him. \nGUS Mr. Lancaster! How's she doing? \nMICHAEL Better, thank you. Much better. Gus nods, as relieved as the rest of them. \nGUS They won't let me in. Family only. \nMICHAEL I'm sorry -- \nGUS No I get it. Will you just... will you tell her I was here? \nMICHAEL Of course I will. Gus smiles. And sits back down. Though he won't get to see her, he still wants to stay. \nMICHAEL Gus. Michael really likes this kid. \nMICHAEL Why don't you go home, get some rest? Gus looks up. That might be for the best. CUT TO: \nINT HOSPITAL - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAYS LATER Hazel and her Parents sit at a very large conference table along with Dr. Maria and THREE OTHER ONCOLOGISTS - her whole \"Cancer Team.\" \nONCOLOGIST #1 The great news is... Phalanxifor continues to control your tumor growth. \n(BEAT) The not so great news is we're still seeing serious problems with fluid accumulation. \n(BEAT) So how should we proceed? Silence. Hazel looks around the room, waits for someone to answer. No one does. \nHAZEL Um, I feel like I'm not the most qualified person to answer that. \nONCOLOGIST #1 I was talking to Dr. Simmons. DR. SIMMONS (late 60s, white beard, old school) speaks next. \nDR. SIMMONS It's a strange case. Normally the tumors start resisting the treatment. But that hasn't happened here - yet. Hazel hears the \"yet\" the loudest. \nDR. SIMMONS Unfortunately, the drug may be worsening the edema. \nFRANNIE We'll be right outside. Hazel nods. Her phone buzzes. She looks at it. A text from Gus that reads: \"ok?\" Hazel looks at it. And she doesn't write back. CUT TO: \nINT HAZEL'S KITCHEN - ANOTHER NIGHT Hazel sits staring at nothing. The house phone rings. Michael comes in from another room with the phone in hand. Whispers: \nMICHAEL Gus again. Hazel thinks about it - silently shakes her head, no. Michael says into the phone. \nMICHAEL I'm sorry Gus, she's asleep. Hazel stands and goes into her bedroom, clearly depressed. \nINT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - LATER Hazel reads from \"An Imperial Affliction.\" Her phone buzzes again. \"Augustus.\" It just says \"hello?\" Again she ignores it. And then a second text. She looks at it. \"The silence is deafening.\" She puts the phone back down. Hazel's heart breaks. She can't take it anymore. She picks the phone back up. She texts the following: \"I don't know if you'll understand this but I can't see you anymore. I mean I want to. I just...\" She thinks about the rest. She writes: \"I'm a grenade.\" She sends the text. Waits. And then there's more to say. She sends a second text. \"When I look at you, all I can see is what I'm going to put you through. I can't have that. I'm sorry.\" She sends that text. Waits. He writes back. \"Ok.\" Hazel reads it. Writes back: \"Ok.\" A beat. Gus responds: \"oh my god, stop flirting with me!\" Hazel smiles - she can't help herself! - but she must. She gets her emotions in check. Puts the phone away. CUT TO: \nEXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - ESTABLISHING An ugly day in Indianapolis. \nINT HAZEL'S HOUSE - SAME Inside, Hazel is about as miserable as the weather. The sky - and the circumstances - have cast a grey pall over the day. \nEXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - BACKYARD Hazel walks out back. Looks up at the clouds, threatening rain but not yet delivering it. She sits down in the grass, on the verge of tears. She looks at the old rusty SWING SET that's been in her backyard for years. \nAnd starts to cry. Just for a few brief moments, she lets herself cry. Then she wipes the tears. Becomes strong again. And makes a decision. Hazel dials her phone. We hear: \nGUS (O.S.) Hazel Grace! \nHAZEL Hi Augustus. \nGUS (O.S.) Are you crying, Hazel Grace? \nHAZEL Kind of. \nGUS (O.S.) What's the matter? \nHAZEL I don't know. I want to go to Amsterdam. And I want him to tell us what happens after the book and I don't want my particular life and also the sky is making me sad and there's this old swing set that my Dad made for me when I was a kid. It's just... everything. Hazel is on the verge of losing it again. A few beats of silence pass by. \nGUS (O.S.) I demand to see this swing set of tears. Hazel can't help but smile and we CUT TO: LATER. Same backyard - only now Hazel is with Gus. Which makes everything better. They both look at the swing set. \nGUS I see your point. \n(BEAT) That is one sad swing set. Hazel nudges her head onto his shoulder. \nHAZEL Thanks for coming over. \nGUS You do realize... trying to keep your distance from me will in no way lessen my affection for you. Hazel says nothing. \nGUS All efforts to save me from you will fail. Hazel looks at him. He's sure not making this easy. \nGUS Is this about Amsterdam? Cause we \nDON'T -- \nHAZEL It's not about Amsterdam. It's about me. It's about... \nGUS Grenades. Hazel nods. \nGUS I get it. One day you're going to explode in a huge ball of fire and everyone close to you will die in your wake. \nHAZEL Exactly. \nGUS There's already two people in your life you're going to destroy. Why add a third to that list. Am I right? \nHAZEL \n(NODS) That's why I don't have a hamster. Gus is silent. He can't argue. They stand there quietly a few more beats, looking out at the swing set. Until: \nGUS We have got to do something about this frigging swing set. \nINT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER Hazel sits at the computer screen writing a Craigslist post. Gus stands next to her. \nHAZEL \n(TYPING) \"Swing Set Needs Home.\" \nGUS \"Desperately Lonely Swing Set Needs Loving Home.\" \nFRANNIE Amsterdam! And a moment later Michael joins them. \nMICHAEL Amsterdam! They're all going crazy with excitement! CUT TO: \nEXT HOUSE - LATER Michael finishes loading up the car. Kisses his wife goodbye. He embraces Hazel. She hugs him back and of course he starts to cry. \nMICHAEL \n(WHISPERING) I love you. I'm so proud of you. \nHAZEL For what? Michael lets go of her and wipes away his tears. They look at each other. Unable to help himself, he grabs her for another hug. Hazel lets him, laughing. \nINT / EXT CAR - LATER The car is packed with oxygen tanks, a suitcase for clothes, another for medicines and back-up medicines just in case etc. Frannie pulls up to Gus's house. They get out of the car and head to the front door, buzzing with excitement. As they get close, they can hear a commotion inside. A WOMAN'S VOICE yelling something unclear, followed by: \nGUS (O.S.) \nBECAUSE IT'S MY LIFE, MOM. IT \nBELONGS TO ME! Frannie immediately puts her arm around Hazel and quickly spins her back to the car. \nHAZEL Mom? \nFRANNIE We can't eavesdrop, Hazel. Back at the car, far out of earshot, they wait. Hazel unsure what that was about. Frannie politely honks the horn. A moment later Gus emerges from the house, smiling. A travel bag over his shoulder and a cigarette dangling from his lips. \nGUS \n(TO FRANNIE) Always a pleasure to see you ma'am. \n(BEAT) Hello, Hazel Grace. \nHAZEL Ok...? \nGUS Ok. \nHAZEL Ok. Frannie doesn't know what to make of any of that. She just says, when they stop and look at her: \nFRANNIE Amsterdam! \nEXT AIRPORT - ESTABLISHING A SKYCAP helps Hazel, Gus and Frannie with all their bags and equipment. \nINT AIRPORT - MOMENTS LATER They wait in line for the security checkpoint. When it's Hazel's turn she unhooks the plastic nubbins from her nose. Gus places the oxygen tank on the conveyer belt. Hazel takes slow, careful steps through the metal detector. She seems determined to get through this without any help. But upon reaching the other side it's clear that even these few steps without oxygen were a struggle. Hazel holds on to the side of the conveyer belt to steady herself. As soon as her tank reappears she puts the cannula back in place. Still light-headed, Hazel closes her eyes and focuses on her breathing. She catches her mom looking at her, nervously. \nHAZEL (with some difficulty) Amsterdam! \nINT AIRPORT GATE - LATER Arriving at the Gate area they draw curious looks from the OTHER PASSENGERS: Hazel with her oxygen tank, Gus with his noticeable limp and Frannie helping with the equipment. A YOUNG COUPLE gets up so that Hazel and Gus can sit. \nHAZEL Oh that's not necessary. But they give up their seats anyway. Hazel and Gus take them. We see various Passengers watching. Hazel ignores the attention until a LITTLE GIRL (6, cute braids) appears. \nLITTLE GIRL What's in your nose? \nHAZEL It's called a Cannula. These tubes give me oxygen and help me breathe. The GIRL'S MOTHER swoops in, a little frantic. \nGIRL'S MOTHER Jackie... Oh, I'm sorry. \nHAZEL \n(SINCERE) No, no. It's alright. \nLITTLE GIRL Would they help me breathe too? \nHAZEL I dunno. Wanna try? Hazel removes her cannula and let's the Little Girl try it. \nLITTLE GIRL Tickles. \nHAZEL Right? \nLITTLE GIRL I think I'm breathing better. \nHAZEL Well... I'd love to give you my cannula but... I kinda really need the help. The Little Girl nods, hands it back to Hazel, who quickly reattaches it. \nHAZEL Mom! \nFRANNIE What? I like watching you sleep. Hazel shoots Frannie a look. Even in an exotic city, her Mom still can't enjoy herself. \nFRANNIE I promise I'll do crazy Mom stuff tonight while you and Gus are at dinner. \nHAZEL What do you mean? \nFRANNIE You have reservations at a place called Oranjee. Mr. Van Houten set it up. Very fancy according to the Book. And romantic. \nHAZEL Mom... \nFRANNIE I'm just saying... \nHAZEL A 16 year old girl running free with an older boy on the streets of a foreign city famous for its vice and debauchery... is totally cool with you. Is that what you're saying? \nFRANNIE (beat, excited) Let's get you dressed! Hazel just shakes her head. CUT TO: \nINT HOTEL ROOM - LATER Frannie opens the door to find Gus in a perfectly tailored BLACK SUIT, cigarette dangling from his mouth. \nFRANNIE (calling to the bathroom) Hazel! Gus is here. \n(TO GUS) Looking sharp. \nGUS Thank you ma'am. A few beats later Hazel emerges from the bathroom. She wears a knee-length, pale blue SUNDRESS. And she looks... \nGUS Wow. \nHAZEL \nI... \n(BEAT) Am I under-dressed? \nGUS You look gorgeous. Gus offers Hazel his arm. She takes it. They're ready to go. \nINT/EXT AMSTERDAM - ON THE TRAM - LATER Hazel and Gus ride the crowded tram through the city. ELM TREES line the canals, their pale petals blowing into the wind like a spring snowstorm. An OLD COUPLE stands to give up their seats - this happens all the time. Hazel again tries to protest and again it falls on deaf ears. She and Gus sit. They look out the window onto the city. Excited. The night just beginning. \nEXT ORANJEE RESTAURANT - LATER At the edge of the canal, near an ancient bridge. Hazel and Gus are shown to a TABLE right next to the water. \nHOSTESS Your table, Mr. And Mrs. Waters. Gus pulls out Hazel's chair for her. A WAITER brings them a bottle of CHAMPAGNE as they sit. \nHOSTESS The champagne is our gift. Hazel and Gus look at each other. Is this a dream? The champagne is poured and Gus raises his glass. \nGUS Ok. Hazel raises hers. \nHAZEL Ok. They clink glasses and sip. \nHAZEL Wow that's good. \nWAITER Do you know what Dom Perignon said after he invented champagne? \n(BEAT) `Come quickly,' he said. `I am tasting the stars!' Hazel and Gus smile. \nWAITER Welcome to Oranjee. Would you like a menu or will you have the chef's choice? Gus looks at Hazel. She shrugs. \nGUS The chef's choice sounds lovely. (the Waiter nods) And can we get more of this? \nWAITER We have bottled all the stars for you this evening, my young friends. The Waiter leaves. Hazel and Gus look at each other. \nGUS Thank you for coming to Amsterdam. \nHAZEL Thank you for letting me hijack your wish. \nGUS Thank you for wearing that dress which is like whoa. Hazel shakes her head, trying not to smile but unable not to. The Waiter brings two more glasses of champagne and a plate: \nWAITER Belgian white asparagus with a lavender infusion. Hazel takes a bite. \nHAZEL Oh my god. \nGUS I'm in love with you. \nThat gets her attention. \nGUS You heard me. \nHAZEL \nAUGUSTUS -- \nGUS I'm in love with you. And I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, and I am in love with you. (shrugs, matter-of-fact) Sorry. At which point, the Waiter reappears. \nWAITER More stars? Hazel is still too speechless to respond, her eyes fixed on Gus. Eventually Gus answers for them. \nGUS Just the check, please. \nWAITER No, sir. \n(BEAT) Your meal has been paid for by Mr. Van Houten. Gus raises his eyebrows at Hazel. This Van Houten guy is something else. \nEXT AMSTERDAM CANALS - LATER Hazel and Gus on a park bench, his arm around her, looking out over the water. Seeds blow from the elm trees and the reflections of the city ripple in the water below them. Hazel leans into his body, just a little. They stay like that, savoring the best night of both of their lives. CUT TO: \nEXT AMSTERDAM - HOTEL - ESTABLISHING A crisp Spring morning in Amsterdam. The buzz in the air outside is equalled by the buzz in: \nINT HOTEL ROOM - SAME Where Hazel excitedly paces through the room. \nFRANNIE I really don't get that shirt. Hazel wears a screen print t-shirt of Magritte's \"Ceci N'est Pas Une Pipe.\" (A painting of a pipe with words below that mean \"This is not a pipe.\") \nHAZEL Van Houten will get it. Trust me. There are like fifty Magritte references in \"Imperial Affliction.\" \nFRANNIE \n(READING) \"This is not a pipe.\" \nHAZEL Exactly. \nFRANNIE But it is a pipe. \nHAZEL No it's not. It's a drawing of a pipe. See? \n(SHE DOESN'T) All representations of a thing are inherently abstract. A drawing of a thing is not the thing itself. Nor is a t-shirt of a drawing of a thing the thing itself. Frannie is still at a loss but she's impressed. \nFRANNIE When did you get so grown up? I feel like it was yesterday I was telling 8-year old Hazel why the sky was blue. You thought I was a genius back then. \nHAZEL Why is the sky blue? \nFRANNIE \n(BEAT) Because I say so. A knock on the door. Gus pokes his head in. \nGUS Who's ready for some answers! \nEXT. VONDELSTRAAT ROW HOUSES - LATER \nGus and Hazel stand outside Van Houten's white house. \nHAZEL I'm so excited I can barely breathe. \nGUS As opposed to other days...? She playfully hits him. He takes her arm, picks up the oxygen tank, and up they go towards his front door. As they approach, there's a noticeable NOISE coming from inside the house. It's the deep thump of a BASS BEAT. Loud. Like, obnoxiously loud. Hazel grabs the brass ornament and knocks. They wait. There's no response. \nGUS Maybe he can't hear over the music? Gus tries again, this time with more force. Still nothing. He tries a third time. Finally, the music stops. They wait. Still excited. A moment later the door swings open. It's a MAN IN PAJAMAS (60s), with a huge potbelly, thinning hair, and a week-old beard. All he says is: \nMAN IN PAJAMAS What?! Gus and Hazel look to one another. Could it be? \nGUS Mr. Van Houten? At which point, the Pajama Man slams the door in their faces. Hazel and Gus are too stunned to react. Through the closed door, they hear this: \nMAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.) \n(SHOUTING) \nGUS You did not spend it on him. You spent it on us. They embrace once more. \nHAZEL I wanted... \nGUS I know... I know. Apparently the world is not a wish-granting factory. This gets a real smile from Hazel. That's when Lidewij comes outside. Clearly she's been crying too. \nLIDEWIJ I'm so sorry. Circumstance has made him cruel. I thought meeting you would help him, if he would see that his work has shaped real lives, but... I'm very sorry. \nHazel says nothing. Gus holds her in a very protective way. \nLIDEWIJ Perhaps we can do some sightseeing. Have you seen the Anne Frank House? \nGUS I'm not going anywhere with that monster. \nLIDEWIJ He is not invited. \nEXT ANNE FRANK HOUSE - LATER Lidewij walks back from the ticket kiosk with more bad news. \nLIDEWIJ I'm afraid there's no elevator. \nHAZEL Oh, um, that's alright. \nLIDEWIJ No, there are many stairs. Steep stairs. \nHAZEL I can do it. \nGUS \nHAZEL -- \nHAZEL I can do it! Hazel is not going to stand for any more disappointments today. They are going inside. CUT TO: \nINT ANNE FRANK HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER A VIDEO plays on a MONITOR showing the Nazi invasion of Holland. Hazel and Gus stand with Lidewij in a pack of BACKPACKERS and TRAVELERS about to take the tour. Many of them begin to walk up the first flight of stairs. \nLIDEWIJ Shall we? Hazel nods. Both Hazel and Gus walk slowly up the stairs. So far so good. They find themselves in an office space. \nLIDEWIJ This is the bookcase that hid the Frank family and four others. The BOOKCASE is half open. Behind it is an even steeper set of stairs, only wide enough for one person at a time. \nSome of the Travelers begin to walk up the stairs. Gus looks at Hazel - are you sure we should continue? She begins the climb, determined. Lidewij trails behind, carrying her oxygen tank. Hazel moves very slowly. We are aware of her labored breathing the entire time. ANGLE ON OTHER TOURISTS, watching and quietly commenting. Just like at the airport, except now in foreign languages. Hazel arrives on the NEXT FLOOR - an empty room. She's definitely starting to struggle. She leans against the wall to catch her breath. Gus comes to her side, wipes her brow. \nGUS You're a champion. Hazel smiles. When she's feeling up to it they walk into the next room, also empty. And another staircase, even more narrow and steep - practically a ladder. When Gus sees this he looks at Hazel: \nGUS That's enough -- \nHAZEL \n(RESOLUTE) I'm ok. Hazel very slowly begins the climb. Again we're aware of her every breath. It's dark. And it's becoming very difficult. Near the top Hazel stumbles but is finally able to pull herself through. Once there, she falls to the floor, slumping against the wall, trying to catch her breath. Gus crouches next to her. \nGUS We're at the top. That's it. Hazel becomes aware that TOURISTS look at her with concern. She smiles, stands up, nothing to see here. And now they're in the final room - a long, narrow hallway. This is where Anne Frank and 7 other people lived in hiding for as long as they could. There's a TIME LINE detailing their story. \nLIDEWIJ The only member of the whole family to survive was Otto, Anne's father. Gus takes Hazel's hand. \nLIDEWIJ I don't know how you go on, without your family. \nLidewij stays behind to study part of the exhibit. Gus leads Hazel into the room at the end of the hallway where a VIDEO details the last days of Anne Frank's life. Over it, we hear a YOUNG GIRL's VOICE reading from the diary. The Travelers stand to watch and listen. Gus and Hazel do the same. The room is dark. \nGIRL'S VOICE (O.S.) \"At such moment's, I don't think about the misery...\" Gus and Hazel stand very closely together. The video is the cherry on top of a very emotional day. Hazel watches it. \nGIRL'S VOICE (O.S.) \"...but about the beauty that still remains.\" Gus, meanwhile, is just watching Hazel, the same way she watched him on the airplane. After a beat, she catches him. Their eyes meet. The emotions build... \nGIRL'S VOICE (O.S.) \"Try to recapture the happiness within yourself. Think of all the beauty in everything around you... and be happy.\" And Hazel KISSES Gus. A most passionate, intense, you-and-me- against-the-world kind of kiss, better than any they've experienced or could even imagine. It seems to last for a small eternity. Eventually, they break away and open their eyes. They quickly notice all the Travelers staring at them. For a brief second, they wonder if that was a very inappropriate thing to do... When suddenly everyone starts clapping for them, moved by the whole thing. One EUROPEAN even shouts \"bravo!\" Hazel blushes, Gus smiles, bows, he grabs her hand. CUT TO: \nINT GUS'S HOTEL ROOM - LATER They fall onto Gus's bed, kissing. Hazel is very in the moment and now it's Gus who seems nervous. As they kiss: \nGUS It's above my knee. She ignores him, more kissing. She takes off his shirt. \nGUS It tapers a little and then it's just skin -- \nHAZEL What? \nSORRY -- \nGUS I'm sorry too -- \nHAZEL It's so unfair -- \nGUS I should have told you -- \nHAZEL It's so fucking unfair! A beat. Gus still trying not to cry. \nGUS Apparently the world is... not a wish-granting factory. And at that point, Gus lets it go, lets himself cry and be sad and feel awful. But just for a second. Then he shakes it off, pulls Hazel's face up to his, tries again to smile through the tears. \nGUS Don't you worry about me, Hazel Grace. I'll find a way to hang around and annoy you for a long time. She hugs him, perhaps a little too tightly. He winces. \nHAZEL Does it hurt? \nGUS It's ok. \n(BEAT) I'm ok. \nHAZEL Ok. \nGUS Ok. But of course it's not ok. Not by a mile. Hazel takes a moment to look at him, touches his cheek. \nGUS What? \nHAZEL I'm just... I'm very fond of you. He grabs her hand and holds it. \nGUS I don't suppose you can forget about it, treat me like I'm not dying. \nHAZEL I don't think you're dying, Augustus. You've just got a touch of cancer. Gus nods. Squeezes her hand. \nGUS Would it be absolutely ludicrous to make out right now? \nHazel doesn't answer. She just kisses him, hard. And on the two of them, so in love, we CUT TO: \nINT AIRPLANE - LATER Hazel lays on Gus's shoulder as he stares out the window, leaving Amsterdam behind. \nINT INDIANAPOLIS AIRPORT - BAGGAGE CLAIM - DAY As they ride down the escalator, Hazel sees Michael standing amongst the livery drivers. He holds a sign that says - instead of someone's last name - \"My Beautiful Family (and Gus).\" Upon seeing them, he immediately starts to cry of course. He kisses his wife, gives Hazel a big hug. Gus goes to shake his hand but Michael hugs him as well. CUT TO: \nINT HAZEL'S LIVING ROOM - THAT NIGHT Hazel sits with her father on the couch. \nHAZEL Gus had a recurrence. \nMICHAEL \n(NODS) Mrs. Waters told us the night before you left. \n(BEAT) I'm sorry Hazel. They sit for a beat. Tears form in Michael's eyes. \nHAZEL You're not gonna say it? \nMICHAEL What's that? \nHAZEL The usual. \"Everything happens for a reason...\" Michael shakes his head. \nMICHAEL I don't know, Haze. \n(BEAT) I always thought being an adult meant knowing what you believe... \n(BEAT) ... that has not been my experience. Hazel understands exactly. CUT TO: \nINT GUS'S BASEMENT BEDROOM - DAY Gus lays in bed, eyes open, a PICC line now being fed through a port in his chest. Chemotherapy at work. Hazel and Isaac are keeping him company. \nHAZEL How are your eyes? \nISAAC Great. Wonderful. I mean, they're not in my head is the only problem. \nGUS I hate to one-up you but... seems my entire body is made out of cancer now, so... Isaac nods. Tries not to get emotional but it's happening. He goes to touch Gus's arm and accidentally touches his thigh. \nISAAC My throw was to the left or I should aim to the left? \nGUS Aim left. Isaac turns his shoulders. \nGUS Lefter. Isaac turns some more. \nGUS Yes! Excellent! And throw hard. Gus hands him a SECOND EGG. Isaac winds up and hurls it - missing the car again but hitting the HOUSE. \nGUS Bullseye! \nISAAC Really? \nGUS No you missed it by like 20 feet. (hands him a THIRD) Try one more time. Isaac hurls it, this time smashing the car's taillight. Isaac's face lights up. \nHAZEL Woo hoo! Isaac grabs for ANOTHER EGG. Throws it. Then ANOTHER. He's a throwing machine. Most of them miss but at least he's enjoying himself. Finally there's a DIRECT HIT on the car door, triggering the alarm. Isaac pauses. \nGUS Keep throwing, keep throwing! Isaac does. Gus smiles, putting an unlit cigarette in his mouth. Hazel watches him, enjoying this moment. Eventually, MONICA'S MOM opens the front door and comes out. \nMONICA'S MOM What in God's name -- Seeing Hazel, Gus, and Isaac, she stops in her tracks. \nGUS Are you Monica's mom? \nMONICA'S MOM \n(CONFUSED) I am. \nGUS Hello ma'am. Your daughter has done an injustice and we've come here seeking revenge. We may not look like much. Between the three of us, we have five legs, four eyes, and two and a half working lungs. \n(MORE) \nGUS (CONT'D) But we also have two dozen eggs. So If I was you, I would go back inside. Monica's Mom is very confused. A beat. Without another word, she turns and goes back inside. The three of them celebrate. As Isaac picks up where he left off, Hazel gently kisses Gus on the cheek. And over we hear: \nHAZEL (V.O.) A few days later, Gus landed in the hospital with chest pains. \nINT HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - DAY Hazel bounds in to find Mrs. Waters in the waiting room. She stands to hug Hazel. They both sit down. \nHAZEL How's he doing? \nMRS. WATERS He's had a tough night, Hazel. His blood pressure's low. His heart -- Mrs. Waters starts to cry. \nHAZEL What about the chemo? \nMRS. WATERS (shakes her head) They're gonna stop the chemo. They both know what that means. Mrs. Waters gathers herself. \nHAZEL Can I see him? \nMRS. WATERS \n(BEAT) We have to be a family now. Hazel nods. She understands. \nMRS. WATERS We'll tell him you were here. \nHAZEL If you don't mind, I'll just hang for a while. Mrs. Waters nods, hugs her again, walks out through the heavy doors towards Gus's room. Hazel sits in the chair. Same chair Gus sat in while waiting for her. They've switched places. \nEXT INDIANAPOLIS MUSEUM OF ART - DAY Hazel pushes Gus, now confined to a WHEELCHAIR, to their spot on the hill overlooking \"Funky Bones.\" A second picnic, this time with champagne. Hazel pours some for them both into little Winnie the Pooh cups. She's trying to be upbeat - but it's difficult. Gus watches the kids play on the bones. \nHAZEL What are you thinking about? \nGUS Oblivion. \nHAZEL Augustus... \nGUS I know it's kid's stuff but... I always thought I'd have a grand story to tell, you know? Something that would run in all the papers. I always thought I was special. \nHAZEL You are. \nGUS Yeah but... you know what I mean. Hazel, annoyed finishes her cup, tosses it to the side. Gus can tell he's said something wrong. \nGUS What? \nGUS (CONT'D) I don't know. They said they'd get me another one but I wanted... to do it myself. Do one little thing myself. Hazel doesn't know what to do. \nHAZEL I can't fix this. I have to call someone. I'm sorry. \nGUS No, Hazel, please! But she must. She gets out her cell phone and dials. At which point, Gus really loses it, weeping like the poisoned, dying teenage boy that he is. As Hazel dials, we hear: \nHAZEL (V.O.) I wish I could say Augustus Waters kept his sense of humor till the end, did not for a moment waiver in his courage and his spirit soared like an eagle to the sky... \nGUS (to himself, shaking) I hate myself I hate myself I hate this I hate this... \nHAZEL (V.O.) ...but that is not what happened. LATER. An EMT loads Gus into the back of an AMBULANCE. Hazel is allowed to ride with him in the back. As the car starts moving, Gus grabs her hand. \nGUS Read me something. \nHAZEL Read you something? \nGUS Do you know any poems? \nHAZEL I know one. \nGUS Read it to me. \nHAZEL \"The Red Wheelbarrow\" by William Carlos Williams. (beat, tries to remember) \"So much depends / upon / a red wheel / barrow / glazed with rain / water / beside the white / chickens.\" \nGUS \n(BEAT) Is that it? That is it. But there's another ten minutes of driving to do. Hazel thinks fast. \nHAZEL No of course not. Um... what else... \n(THINKS) so much depends/ upon a blue sky/ cut open by the branches/ of the trees./ So much depends/ on the transparent G-tube/ erupting from the belly/ of the blue-lipped boy. Gus smiles, weakly, barely conscious. Hazel cradles his head in her arms. And continues... \nHAZEL So much depends upon this observer/ of the universe... As Gus is drifting off to sleep, WE HEAR: \nHAZEL (V.O.) One of the less bull-shitty conventions of the cancer genre is the convention known as the \"Last Good Day...\" \nEXT GUS'S HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY Gus comes home from the hospital. He does not look good - but he lives. Hazel is there to help get him inside. \nINT GUS'S HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY Gus no longer sleeps in his basement. Nor does he sleep in his own bed. He sleeps in a HOSPITAL BED set up in a guest room. Hazel is with him. They're watching sports on TV. \nHAZEL (V.O.) This is where the victim of cancer finds himself unexpectedly with some hours... \nEXT GUS'S BACKYARD PORCH - ANOTHER DAY Hazel and Gus getting some fresh air. She sits there reading a book. Gus just sits there. His eyes staring off into nothing. Hazel waves to him. Gus looks over, as if waking from a dream. She manages a smile. He manages one back. \nHAZEL (V.O.) ... when it seems like the inexorable decline has suddenly plateaued, when the pain is for a minute bearable. \nINT HAZEL'S DINING ROOM - ANOTHER DAY Hazel sits at dinner with her parents. She is barely touching her food. \nHAZEL (V.O.) The problem, of course, is that there's no way of knowing that your last good day is your \"Last Good Day.\" At the time, it's just another decent day. The phone buzzes and Hazel answers it. \nHAZEL Hi, Augustus. \nGUS (O.S.) Good evening, Hazel Grace. His voice is strong today, and Hazel is happy to hear it. \nGUS (O.S.) Quick question for you. Did you ever write that eulogy I asked you to prepare? \nHAZEL I may have... \nGUS Excellent. Do you think you could find yourself at the Literal Heart of Jesus in 20 minutes. \nHAZEL Um... sure. Is everything -- \nGUS (O.S.) I love you Hazel. The call ends. Hazel, confused, stands to go. \nHAZEL I gotta go. \nFRANNIE Finish eating first. \nHAZEL I can't, I have to meet Gus. \nHAZEL I know Mom. And I will. I promise. But right now... I really gotta go. \nINT CHURCH - LATER Hazel enters the Literal Heart of Jesus room which is now empty except for Isaac, up on a dais, and Gus, in his wheelchair. Gus is thinner than we've ever seen him, thinner than any young man should be. But for now, he's happy. \nGUS Hazel Grace, you look ravishing. \nHAZEL I know, right? \n(BEAT) So, um, what's going on guys? \nISAAC You're late. \nHAZEL Late for what exactly? \nGus gestures for her to sit next to him and she does. \nGUS I wanted to attend my funeral. By the way, will you speak at my funeral? Hazel looks at him like \"of course, silly\" and then kisses him on the mouth. \nGUS Sweet. I'm hopeful I'll get to attend as a ghost, but just to make sure, I thought I'd - well, not to put you on the spot, but I thought I'd arrange a pre-funeral. \nHAZEL Why now? \nGUS No time like the present. \nHAZEL (looks around the room) How did you even get in here? \nGUS Would you believe they leave the door open at night? \nHAZEL Um, no. \nGUS As well you shouldn't. He smiles and for a brief moment it's old Gus. Hazel laughs. Isaac clears his throat. \nISAAC \"Augustus Waters was a self- aggrandizing bastard. But we forgive him. We forgive him... not because he had a heart as figuratively good as his actual one sucked, or because he got 18 years when he should have gotten more.\" \nGUS \nISAAC I'm assuming you've got some time, you interrupting bastard! I mean seriously... (back to the speech) \"Augustus Waters talked so much that he'd interrupt you at his own funeral. And he was pretentious. \n(MORE) \nISAAC (CONT'D) Sweet Jesus that kid never took a piss without pondering the resonances of human waste production. And he was vain. But that comes with superhuman handsomeness.\" Gus nods - that part is true. \nISAAC \"But I will say this: when the scientists of the future show up at my house with robot eyes and they tell me to try them on, I will tell the scientists to piss off, because I don't even want to see a world without Augustus Waters.\" Hazel smiles - but it's one that triggers an immediate emotional waterfall. \nISAAC \"And then, of course, having made my rhetorical point, I will put my robot eyes on because, I mean... robot eyes!\" Gus has a big smile on his face. \nISAAC \"So anyway, Augustus, my friend... Godspeed.\" Gus nods a couple times. \nGUS Thank you Isaac. This causes Isaac to lose it. He clings to the lectern. \nISAAC Goddamn it, Gus. \nGUS Hey don't swear in the Literal Heart of Jesus. \nISAAC Shit! Ass! Balls! Isaac sighs. Wipes away the tears. And another beat passes. \nISAAC Can I get a hand here, Hazel? Hazel remembers Isaac can't see. She rises, goes up to get him, walks him back to her seat. \nGUS Hazel Grace, it's down to you. \nHazel takes out a piece of paper, walks up to the dais. Takes a beat to ready herself. \nHAZEL \"Augustus Waters was the great star- crossed love of my life. Ours was an epic love story, and I won't be able to get more than a sentence into it without disappearing into a puddle of tears. \n(BEAT) Like all real love stories - ours will die with us, as it should. I'd hoped that he'd be eulogizing me, because there's no one I'd rather have...\" And that's all she can get out before falling apart. She lets it out for a couple beats and then pulls herself together. \nHAZEL (beat, composing herself) \"I can't talk about our love story so instead I will talk about math. I am not a mathematician, but I know this: there are infinite numbers between 0 and 1. There's .1 And .12 And .112 And an infinite collection of others. Of course, there is a bigger infinite set of numbers between 0 and 2, or between 0 and a million. Some infinities are bigger than other infinities. A writer we used to like taught us that. I want more numbers than I'm likely to get, and God, I want more numbers for Augustus Waters than he got. But, Gus, my love, I cannot tell you how thankful I am for our little infinity. You gave me a forever within the numbered days, and for that I am eternally grateful. I love you.\" Gus smiles, nods, and closes his eyes. CUT TO: \nBLACK. Over which we hear a RINGING TELEPHONE. \n", "test1_input": "ISAAC Did she really just say \"you'll see?\" \nHAZEL (shakes her head) Qualities of a Good Nurse. Go. \nISAAC Doesn't pun your disability. \nHAZEL Gets blood on the first try. \nISAAC That is huge. I mean, seriously, is this my freakin' arm or a dartboard? Three - no condescending voice. \nHAZEL (lays it on thick) \"I'm gonna stab you with this needle now, so there might be a little ouchie.\" They laugh and then lapse into silence for a moment. \nHAZEL You doing alright, Isaac? \nISAAC I don't know. To be honest, I think a hell of a lot more about Monica than my eye. Is that crazy? That's crazy. \nHAZEL It's a little crazy. \nISAAC But I believe in love, you know? I don't believe that everybody gets to keep their eyes or not get sick or whatever, but everybody should have true love. Don't you think? Hazel thinks about it as Isaac presses the button on his pain pump, self-administering morphine. \nISAAC Gus was here earlier. \nHAZEL (trying to be nonchalant) Was he? Isaac exhales as the pain pump starts to kick in. \nISAAC Mmm... that's better. \nHAZEL The pain? (off his slow nod) Good. Good, Isaac. (Isaac closes his eyes) What about Gus? But Isaac is already asleep. Whatever he was going to say about Gus is gone. Hazel nods, pats his hand. CUT TO: \nINT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - MORNING Hazel rolls out of bed, stumbles to her computer. She casually checks her in-box and is shocked to discover - he's written her back! \nHAZEL Holy shit! \n(READING ALOUD) \"Dear Ms. Lancaster... I cannot answer your questions, at least not in writing, because to do so would constitute a sequel, which you might publish or otherwise share on the internet. Not that I don't trust you, but how could I trust you, I barely know you.\" Hazel's jaw hangs open as she reads the next part: \nHAZEL \"Should ever you find yourself in Amsterdam, do pay a visit at your leisure. Yours most sincerely, Peter Van Houten\" Son of a - WHAT \nIS THIS LIFE!!! \nFrannie races in, clearly expecting a health problem. \nFRANNIE What's wrong?! \nHAZEL (realizing she scared her) Nothing. Sorry. \nFRANNIE \n(CONFUSED) Nothing? \nHAZEL Everything! Look! Hazel shows Frannie the note. Frannie reads it. \nHAZEL Can we go to Amsterdam? Please? Frannie thinks about how to respond for a beat. \nFRANNIE Hazel, I... I love you and... you know I'd do anything for you, but we don't... \n(PAINED) We don't have the money. The expense of getting equipment over there - love, it's just not possible... \nHAZEL \n(DEFLATES) No, yeah, of course. Clearly Frannie feels awful. Which makes Hazel feel awful. \nFRANNIE I mean, I could talk to your father \nOR -- \nHAZEL Mom, no. Please. Don't do anything. Forget I mentioned it. A beat between them. Frannie walks out, sadly. Hazel sits on the bed, totally bummed now for two reasons. \nHAZEL (V.O.) Guilt is definitely a side effect of cancer. \nEXT SUBURBAN STREET - LATER Hazel and Gus walk together on the sidewalk. \n", "test1_true": "HAZEL I've used it already. Pre- \"Miracle.\" \nGUS What'd you do? Hazel doesn't want to say. Gus realizes. \nGUS Not Disney. \nHAZEL I was 13... \nGUS Tell me you did not go to Disney World. (Hazel looks away) Hazel Grace! You did not use your one dying Wish to go to Disney World! \nHAZEL \n(FEEBLE) And Epcot Center. \nGUS (hands in the air) Oh my God! \nHAZEL \n(DEFENDING HERSELF) We had fun on that trip. \nGUS That is the saddest thing I've ever heard! \nHAZEL I met Goofy... \nGUS Now I'm embarrassed. \nHAZEL Why are you embarrassed? \nGUS How can I have a crush on a girl with such cliche wishes? \nHAZEL Wait, what? The word \"crush\" has taken Hazel totally by surprise. \nGUS What? She looks at him. A beat. She quickly looks away, blushing. Gus continues on about Disney but all Hazel can think about is \"CRUSH\". She tries not to seem too excited. CUT TO: \nINT PET SCAN ROOM - DAY Hazel, in a hospital gown, is slowly fed through the machine. A TECH explains that she should hold still, try and relax, etc. But Hazel knows. She knows all about these procedures. She's a pro. CUT TO: \nEXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - FRONT Gus is waiting on the front stoop when Frannie's car pulls up. They're home from the hospital. He wears an Indiana Pacers JERSEY and carries a bouquet of bright orange TULIPS. Michael gets out of the passenger's seat to help Hazel out of the car. Gus rises to assist them. \nMICHAEL Is that a Rik Smits jersey? \nGUS It is indeed. \nMICHAEL \n(BEAT) Man, I loved that guy. Hazel sees Gus, wasn't expecting him. \nHAZEL Gus? \nGUS Hi Hazel. \n(BEAT) How would you like to go on a picnic? \nINT HAZEL'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER Gus is with Frannie and Michael downstairs. \nFRANNIE Something to drink? \nGUS I'm great Mrs. Lancaster. \nMeanwhile, upstairs, Hazel gets ready for the date. She's put the orange flowers in a toothbrush holder and is putting on LIP GLOSS. She can faintly hear the conversation downstairs. ANGLE ON Gus sitting on the stairs. Michael next to him. \nMICHAEL You're a survivor yourself? \nGUS (taps his leg) Didn't cut this fella off for the hell of it. Though it is an excellent weight-loss strategy. Legs are heavy! \nMICHAEL How's your health now? \nGUS N-E-C for fourteen months. \n", "test1_id": 831, "test2_input": "HAZEL We have some questions -- \nVAN HOUTEN Uh-huh... \nHAZEL About what happens, you know... after... the end of your book. Specifically to those who Anna leaves behind. Like her Mom, the Dutch Tulip Man, Sisy -- \nVAN HOUTEN \n(INTERRUPTING) How familiar are you with Swedish hip-hop? Hazel looks at Gus. Is he kidding? \nHAZEL I would say... limited? \nVAN HOUTEN But presumably you know Afasi Och Filthy's seminal album \"Flacken.\" \nGUS Um... \nVAN HOUTEN Lidewij! Play `Bomfalleralla' immediately. \nLidewij sighs but she does as she's told. A few seconds later, some loud Swedish rap song blasts from the speakers. Hazel and Gus sit through this, totally baffled. \nHAZEL (yelling over the music) I'm sorry, sir. We don't speak Swedish. \nVAN HOUTEN \n(YELLING) Who the hell speaks Swedish? The important thing is not what nonsense the voices are saying, but what the voices are feeling. The song continues another awkward ten seconds or so before Gus has enough. He gets up and turns off the music. \nGUS Are you messing with us? \nVAN HOUTEN Pardon? \nGUS Is this some kind of performance? \nVAN HOUTEN Rudolf Otto said that if you had not encountered the numinous then his work was not for you. And I say to you, my friends, if you cannot hear Afasi Och Filthy's bravadic response to fearfulness, then my work is not for you. Hazel is really getting worried at this point. They came all this way for this? \nHAZEL So anyway... when the book ends, Anna's mom -- \nVAN HOUTEN (raising a hand to silence \nHER) Let us imagine that you are racing a tortoise. Hazel and Gus fidget in their seats. Lidewij frowns, clearly feeling bad for them. Van Houten continues. \nVAN HOUTEN The tortoise has a ten yard head start. In the time it takes you to run ten yards, the tortoise has moved maybe one yard. And so on, forever. \n(MORE) \nVAN HOUTEN (CONT'D) You are faster than the tortoise but you can never catch him, you see, you can only decrease his lead. Now certainly you can run past the tortoise as long as you don't contemplate the mechanics involved but the question of how turns out to be so complicated that no one really solved it until Cantor's proof that some infinities are bigger than other infinities. Hazel and Gus have no idea how to respond. \nVAN HOUTEN I assume that answers your questions. \nGUS \n(TO HAZEL) I don't know what's going on. \nVAN HOUTEN And yet you seemed so intelligent in print, Mr. Waters. (under his breath) Must be all that cancer in your brain. \nLIDEWIJ Peter! Gus could throw a punch right now. Hazel tries to calm the situation. \nHAZEL Can we please, maybe, talk about Anna for a sec? I mean, I understand that the story ends mid- sentence because she dies or she becomes too sick to continue -- \nVAN HOUTEN I'm not interested in talking about that book. \nHAZEL - but that doesn't mean her family and everyone she loves doesn't have a future, right? \nVAN HOUTEN I said I'm not interested -- \nHAZEL \n(GETTING UPSET) But you promised! \n(CALMS HERSELF) \n", "test2_true": "HAZEL (CONT'D) Mr. Van Houten, you said you would tell us what happens and that's why we're here. We... I need you tell me. Surely you've thought about it. I mean, as characters -- \nVAN HOUTEN Nothing happens to them! They're fictions. They cease to exist the moment the novel is over. This is not what Hazel came all this way to hear. She won't accept it. \nHAZEL They can't! (again, has to calm \nHERSELF) I mean, I understand. In a literary sense. But it's impossible NOT to imagine some future -- \nVAN HOUTEN I can't do this. Lidewij, get rid of them, please. (Lidewij doesn't move, he turns back to Hazel) I won't indulge your childish whims. I refuse to pity you in the manner in which you're accustomed. \nHAZEL I don't want your pity -- \nVAN HOUTEN Of course you do. Like all sick kids, your existence depends on it. \nLIDEWIJ Peter! \nVAN HOUTEN (on a roll) You are fated to live out your days as the child you were when diagnosed, the child who believes there is life after a novel ends. And we, as adults, we pity this, so we pay for your treatments, for your oxygen machines. We give you food and water though you are unlikely to live long enough -- \nLIDEWIJ \nPETER! \nVAN HOUTEN You are a side effect of an evolutionary process that cares little for individual lives. \n(MORE) \nVAN HOUTEN (CONT'D) You are a failed experiment in mutation. \nLIDEWIJ \nI RESIGN! Lidewij has tears in her eyes. Gus has balled his fists. But not Hazel. Van Houten's words have not phased her one bit. She rises from the couch. \nHAZEL Hey listen douchepants. You're not gonna tell me anything I don't already know about illness. I need one thing and one thing only from you before I walk out of your life and that's for you to tell me what happens to your goddman characters! \nVAN HOUTEN \n(BEAT) I cannot tell you. \nHAZEL Bullshit! \nVAN HOUTEN I cannot -- Van Houten goes to take a drink but... \nHAZEL Make something up. ... Hazel smacks it right the fuck out of his hands, surprising everyone. After a beat: \nVAN HOUTEN Lidewij. I'll have a martini please. \nLIDEWIJ I have resigned. \nVAN HOUTEN Oh don't be ridiculous. No one moves. Van Houten realizes he's alone in this. \nVAN HOUTEN I'd like you to leave now. \nHAZEL You're really not gonna tell us? \nVAN HOUTEN I would like you... to leave. \nHazel is furious. Gus stands next to her, touches her arm is if to say \"come on, enough of this guy.\" CUT TO: \nEXT VAN HOUTEN'S HOUSE - SAME Gus and Hazel come out of the house, practically shaking. As they get to the street, Van Houten has one more thing to say. \nVAN HOUTEN Have you ever stopped to ask why you care so much about your silly questions? A beat. \nHAZEL Go fuck yourself. Van Houten doesn't have a response to that. He just shuts the door. And when he does, that's when Hazel gets emotional. \nGUS Hey. It's ok. It's ok... (beat, an idea) I'll write you a sequel. (she cries harder) I will. Better than any shit that drunk could write. With blood and guts and sacrifice. You'll love it. Hazel nods, then wipes away tears. She fakes a smile and Gus gives her a hug. Afterwards: \nHAZEL I spent your Wish on that asshole. \n", "test2_id": 832, "test3_input": "VAN HOUTEN Omnis Cellula e cellula. Hazel ignores him. \nVAN HOUTEN Your boy Waters and I corresponded quite a bit in his last -- \nHAZEL You read your fan mail now? \nVAN HOUTEN I would hardly call him a fan. He despised me. But he was quite insistent I attend his funeral and tell you what became of Anna and her mother. So here I am and that's your answer: omnis cellula e cellula. \nHAZEL I'm so not in the mood -- \nVAN HOUTEN \"Life comes from life.\" \nHAZEL Goodbye Mr. Van Houten. \nVAN HOUTEN You don't want an explanation? \nHAZEL Nope. Thanks though. Have a great life. \nVAN HOUTEN You remind me of her. \nHAZEL \n(BEAT) I remind a lot of people of a lot of people. \nVAN HOUTEN She was eight, my daughter. She suffered... beautifully. For so long. Hazel starts to understand Van Houten - and softens. \nHAZEL She had leukemia? Like Anna? \nVAN HOUTEN Just like her, yes. \nHAZEL Were you married then? \nVAN HOUTEN Not when she died, no. I was insufferable long before Anna, my dear. Grief doesn't change you, Hazel, it reveals you. Hazel takes that in. \nHAZEL Well I'm sorry for your loss. \nVAN HOUTEN And I'm sorry for yours. I'm sorry for everything, for being so rude to you two, for ruining your trip -- \nHAZEL You didn't ruin our trip, you asshole. We had an awesome trip. \nVAN HOUTEN Hazel, I'm trying. I'm trying! You asked me to tell you what happens and I wish I could do that. I wish that I could. But I can't. No one can. No one knows, Hazel. They don't talk to us. Unless... Van Houten takes out a typed piece of paper. He hands it to Hazel who grabs it - and immediately crumples it into a ball. \nHAZEL You think I care about that? I don't give a shit, Van Houten. Hazel throws the piece of paper at Van Houten. \nHAZEL You're a drunk and a jerk and a failure. And I'd like you to get out of my car right now so I can go home and grieve. \nVAN HOUTEN \n(STUNNED) \nBUT -- \nHAZEL Get out of the car! Van Houten knows he's too late. He does as he's told, stepping out of the car onto the side of the road. He stands there as Hazel peels out. In the rearview mirror, she sees him raise the FLASK, as if toasting her. She blinks away some tears and drives. CUT TO: \nINT HAZEL'S LIVING ROOM - DAY Hazel lies in front of the TV. \"Top Model\" is playing but she's lost in her own world. Tears fall from her eyes and she can't do anything to stop it. Hazel gets up. \nINT BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS Hazel sits against the tub on the floor and weeps. Soon there's a knock. \nHAZEL \n(THROUGH TEARS) Occupada. \nMICHAEL (O.S.) Can I come in? Hazel leans over and unlocks the door. Michael kneels down next to her, putting her head on his shoulder. Hazel presses her face into his shirt and cries some more. Michael squeezes her tightly. And this time, he doesn't cry. \nMICHAEL I'm so so sorry. \n(BEAT) It was a privilege to love him, though, wasn't it? Hazel nods into his shirt. Then looks up at her Dad. \nMICHAEL Gives you an idea how we feel about you. Michael smiles at Hazel. And he doesn't cry. Hazel draws strength from him. \n", "test3_true": "ISAAC Do you know if it hurt or whatever? \nHAZEL He was really fighting for breath, I guess. He eventually went unconscious, but it seems like, yeah, it wasn't great or anything. Dying sucks. \nISAAC \n(LONG BEAT) It just seems so impossible. \nHAZEL Happens all the time. \nISAAC Are you angry? \nHAZEL Very. \nISAAC Me too. (a few beats) Gus really loved you, you know. \nHAZEL I know. \nISAAC He wouldn't shut up about it. \nHAZEL I know. \nISAAC It was annoying. \nHAZEL I didn't find it that annoying. They sit there in silence a few beats. \nISAAC Did you read the note or whatever from your author friend? \nHAZEL He is not my friend and -- how do you know about that? \nISAAC We talked at the cemetery. Said he came all this way to give you that. \nHAZEL Yeah well I'm over it. I never want to read another word of that asshole's again. \nISAAC Yeah but he didn't write it - Gus did. \nHAZEL \n(STUNNED) What? \nISAAC That's what he said. Gus had written something, sent it to Van \nHOUTEN -- Hazel sits up. Her heart is racing. \nISAAC What? \nHAZEL I... I have to go. I... Are you...? \nISAAC I do it all the time. Go. As quickly as possible Hazel leaves. Isaac stays behind, enjoying the cool night. A new day is coming. \nINT/ EXT HAZEL'S CAR - DAY Hazel is inside the car, rummaging crazily through the trash in an effort to find what Van Houten gave her. She's about to give up when she sees it - crumpled up into a ball beneath the passenger's seat. She reaches under, pulls it up, and unwraps it. As she reads, WE HEAR: \nGUS'S VOICE Mr. Van Houten, I'm a good person but a shitty writer. You're a shitty person but a good writer. We'd make a good team. I don't want to ask you any favors but if you have the time, and from what I saw you have plenty, please fix this for me. It's a eulogy for Hazel. Hazel is overcome with emotion. \nGUS'S VOICE She asked me to write one and I'm trying, I just, I could use a little flair. See the thing is... we all want to be remembered. She smiles to herself, remembering: - That first time Gus and Hazel ran into each other. - The staring contest in Support Group. \nGUS'S VOICE We all want to leave a mark. - Driving (badly) in Gus's car. - Their first kiss at the picnic by \"Funky Bones.\" \nGUS'S VOICE But not Hazel. Hazel is different. Hazel knows the truth. She didn't want a million admirers, she just wanted one. And she got it. Maybe she wasn't loved widely but she was loved deeply. And isn't that more than most of us get? - And BACK TO HAZEL reading the letter, tears in her eyes. \nGUS'S VOICE When Hazel was sick, I knew I was dying. But I didn't want to say so. \nINT ICU - FLASHBACK Gus stealthily sneaks into Hazel's single room in the ICU. She sleeps. He kneels by her side. \nGUS'S VOICE She was in ICU and I snuck in for ten minutes and sat with her before I got caught. Her eyes were closed, her lungs were intubated... \nGus takes her hand and holds it. \n", "test3_id": 833}

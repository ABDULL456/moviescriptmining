{"test1_input": "PATRICK And how are you feeling Augustus? \nGUS Me? Oh I'm grand. I'm on a roller coaster that only goes up, my friend. Hazel smiles. Gus catches this. Embarrassed, she stops smiling and looks away. \nPATRICK Perhaps you'd like to share your fears with the group, Augustus. \nGUS My fears? Gus thinks about this. \nGUS Oblivion. \nPATRICK Oblivion? ANGLE ON Hazel, intrigued. \nGUS Yeah, see... I intend to live an extraordinary life. To be remembered. If I'm scared of anything it's... not doing that. Patrick doesn't quite have the tools to deal with that. \nPATRICK Would, uh, anyone like to speak to that? And Hazel's hand goes up. Even Patrick is surprised by that. \nPATRICK Hazel! That's unexpected. Hazel stands, takes a second to gather her thoughts. Augustus watches her, waits for it. \nHAZEL I just wanna say... there will come a time when, you know, all of us are dead. Gus is now even more fixed on her than before. \nHAZEL It might be tomorrow. Might be a million years from now but... it's gonna happen. And when it does, enough generations will come and go, there'll be no one left to remember Cleopatra. Or Mozart. Or Muhammad Ali, let alone any of us, right? The look on Gus's face is unreadable. \nHAZEL Oblivion's inevitable. And if that scares you, well, I suggest you ignore it. God knows it's what everyone else does. A beat. And then an enormous smile spreads across Gus's face, not a flirty smile but a surprised one, a real one. CUT TO: \nEXT OUTSIDE THE CHURCH - LATER Hazel waits for her Mom's car to appear. Across the parking lot, she sees Isaac going at it with a redhead, MONICA (17), sucking face like there's no tomorrow against the door of her green Pontiac Firebird. Between kisses, we can hear: \nISAAC MONICA Always. Always. \nAnd Hazel hears: \nGUS Literally. Hazel turns to find the Beautiful Boy, Augustus, standing right next to her. \nGUS I thought we were in a church basement but apparently we were literally in the heart of Jesus. Hazel smiles. \nHAZEL Someone should probably tell him, don't you think? Jesus? Seems kinda dangerous keeping all these kids with cancer in your heart. Gus laughs. \nGUS What's your name? \nHAZEL Hazel. \nGUS No your full name? \nHAZEL \n(CONFUSED) Hazel Grace Lancaster. Gus nods to himself, smiles. Still fixated on her. \nHAZEL What? \nGUS I didn't say anything. \nHAZEL Why are you looking at me like that? \nGUS Because you're beautiful. Hazel is taken aback. No one's ever said that to her before. \nGUS I enjoy looking at beautiful people and I decided a while back not to deny myself the simpler pleasures of existence. Particularly given that, as you so astutely pointed out, we're all gonna die pretty soon. \nHAZEL \n(BEAT) I'm not beaut -- A CUTE YOUNG GIRL walks past them. \nYOUNG GIRL Hey Gus. \nGUS Hey Alisa. Hazel isn't surprised that other girls know Gus. Of course they do. She turns back towards Isaac and Monica pawing at each other. She hears: \nISAAC MONICA Always. Always. \nHAZEL What's with the \"always?\" \nGUS \"Always\" is their thing. They'll \"always\" love each other and whatnot. Must have texted \"always\" to each other at least four million times this year. They continue to watch the show. It's pretty gross. Isaac squeezes Monica's breast like a clown horn. \n", "test1_true": "GUS Let's watch a movie. Hazel is again surprised. \nHAZEL Oh. Um. Uh... (yes!) Sure. Yeah. I'm... pretty free this \nWEEK-- \nGUS No I mean now. \nHAZEL What? \nGUS Hmm? \nHAZEL What do you mean \"now?\" \nGUS I've got a car. He shrugs. Hazel has never seen someone so confident. \nHAZEL You could be an axe murderer. \nGUS There is that possibility. \n(BEAT) Come on Hazel Grace... take a risk. As Hazel mulls this over, Gus reaches into his pocket and pulls out, of all things, a pack of cigarettes! Hazel is in disbelief. He flips the box open, puts a cigarette between his lips. \nHAZEL Oh my god. Oh. My. God. You're kidding right? (off his look) You just ruined the whole thing! \nGUS Whole thing? \nHAZEL What, you think that's cool? Oh you idiot! There's always a hamartia, isn't there? And yours is - even though you had FREAKING CANCER you give money to a corporation for the chance to acquire EVEN MORE CANCER!? Ugh. And you were doing so well. As she rants, Gus continues to look at her with that smile on his face. Hazel does not find it so amusing. \nHAZEL Let me tell you... not being able to breathe? Sucks. Totally sucks. \nGUS Hamartia? Hazel folds her arms and turns away from him. \nHAZEL A fatal flaw. Gus takes a beat and then moves to face her, the smile still etched on his face. \nGUS They don't hurt you unless you light them. \nHAZEL Sorry? \nGUS I've never lit one. Hazel turns back to him. \nGUS It's a metaphor. See? You put the thing that kills you between your teeth. But you don't give it the power to do the killing. Hazel is floored. And impressed. \nHAZEL Metaphor. Gus holds her gaze. And it's at this point Frannie pulls up. \nFRANNIE Hi sweetheart. Ready for some \"Model?\" \nHazel looks at Gus, cigarette dangling from his lips. Cool as anything. Handsome as hell. She looks back at her mom. \nHAZEL Can't tonight. (off her confused look) I've made plans with Augustus Waters. And with that, she walks off. Frannie looks at the boy with the cigarette in his mouth. This could be trouble. Or awesome. Or both. And we CUT TO: \nINT GUS'S CAR - LATER Hazel is terrified. Turns out, Gus is the world's worst driver. When he brakes, her body flies forward against the seatbelt. And when he hits the gas, seconds later, her neck snaps back in the seat. Gus sees the look on her face. \nGUS I failed the test a couple times. \nHAZEL You don't say. \nGUS Most amputees can drive with no problem but... yeah. Not me. \nHAZEL I'm surprised you have a license. \nGUS Tell me about it! Another brake forces Hazel against the seat belt. \nGUS The fourth time I took the test... it was going about how this is going... and when it was over, the instructor looks at me and goes, \"your driving, while unpleasant... is not technically unsafe.\" \nHAZEL Aha. Cancer perk. \nGUS Total cancer perk. A few beats of silence. \n", "test1_id": 831, "test2_input": "ISAAC Did she really just say \"you'll see?\" \nHAZEL (shakes her head) Qualities of a Good Nurse. Go. \nISAAC Doesn't pun your disability. \nHAZEL Gets blood on the first try. \nISAAC That is huge. I mean, seriously, is this my freakin' arm or a dartboard? Three - no condescending voice. \nHAZEL (lays it on thick) \"I'm gonna stab you with this needle now, so there might be a little ouchie.\" They laugh and then lapse into silence for a moment. \nHAZEL You doing alright, Isaac? \nISAAC I don't know. To be honest, I think a hell of a lot more about Monica than my eye. Is that crazy? That's crazy. \nHAZEL It's a little crazy. \nISAAC But I believe in love, you know? I don't believe that everybody gets to keep their eyes or not get sick or whatever, but everybody should have true love. Don't you think? Hazel thinks about it as Isaac presses the button on his pain pump, self-administering morphine. \nISAAC Gus was here earlier. \nHAZEL (trying to be nonchalant) Was he? Isaac exhales as the pain pump starts to kick in. \nISAAC Mmm... that's better. \nHAZEL The pain? (off his slow nod) Good. Good, Isaac. (Isaac closes his eyes) What about Gus? But Isaac is already asleep. Whatever he was going to say about Gus is gone. Hazel nods, pats his hand. CUT TO: \nINT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - MORNING Hazel rolls out of bed, stumbles to her computer. She casually checks her in-box and is shocked to discover - he's written her back! \nHAZEL Holy shit! \n(READING ALOUD) \"Dear Ms. Lancaster... I cannot answer your questions, at least not in writing, because to do so would constitute a sequel, which you might publish or otherwise share on the internet. Not that I don't trust you, but how could I trust you, I barely know you.\" Hazel's jaw hangs open as she reads the next part: \nHAZEL \"Should ever you find yourself in Amsterdam, do pay a visit at your leisure. Yours most sincerely, Peter Van Houten\" Son of a - WHAT \nIS THIS LIFE!!! \nFrannie races in, clearly expecting a health problem. \nFRANNIE What's wrong?! \nHAZEL (realizing she scared her) Nothing. Sorry. \nFRANNIE \n(CONFUSED) Nothing? \nHAZEL Everything! Look! Hazel shows Frannie the note. Frannie reads it. \nHAZEL Can we go to Amsterdam? Please? Frannie thinks about how to respond for a beat. \nFRANNIE Hazel, I... I love you and... you know I'd do anything for you, but we don't... \n(PAINED) We don't have the money. The expense of getting equipment over there - love, it's just not possible... \nHAZEL \n(DEFLATES) No, yeah, of course. Clearly Frannie feels awful. Which makes Hazel feel awful. \nFRANNIE I mean, I could talk to your father \nOR -- \nHAZEL Mom, no. Please. Don't do anything. Forget I mentioned it. A beat between them. Frannie walks out, sadly. Hazel sits on the bed, totally bummed now for two reasons. \nHAZEL (V.O.) Guilt is definitely a side effect of cancer. \nEXT SUBURBAN STREET - LATER Hazel and Gus walk together on the sidewalk. \n", "test2_true": "HAZEL I've used it already. Pre- \"Miracle.\" \nGUS What'd you do? Hazel doesn't want to say. Gus realizes. \nGUS Not Disney. \nHAZEL I was 13... \nGUS Tell me you did not go to Disney World. (Hazel looks away) Hazel Grace! You did not use your one dying Wish to go to Disney World! \nHAZEL \n(FEEBLE) And Epcot Center. \nGUS (hands in the air) Oh my God! \nHAZEL \n(DEFENDING HERSELF) We had fun on that trip. \nGUS That is the saddest thing I've ever heard! \nHAZEL I met Goofy... \nGUS Now I'm embarrassed. \nHAZEL Why are you embarrassed? \nGUS How can I have a crush on a girl with such cliche wishes? \nHAZEL Wait, what? The word \"crush\" has taken Hazel totally by surprise. \nGUS What? She looks at him. A beat. She quickly looks away, blushing. Gus continues on about Disney but all Hazel can think about is \"CRUSH\". She tries not to seem too excited. CUT TO: \nINT PET SCAN ROOM - DAY Hazel, in a hospital gown, is slowly fed through the machine. A TECH explains that she should hold still, try and relax, etc. But Hazel knows. She knows all about these procedures. She's a pro. CUT TO: \nEXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - FRONT Gus is waiting on the front stoop when Frannie's car pulls up. They're home from the hospital. He wears an Indiana Pacers JERSEY and carries a bouquet of bright orange TULIPS. Michael gets out of the passenger's seat to help Hazel out of the car. Gus rises to assist them. \nMICHAEL Is that a Rik Smits jersey? \nGUS It is indeed. \nMICHAEL \n(BEAT) Man, I loved that guy. Hazel sees Gus, wasn't expecting him. \nHAZEL Gus? \nGUS Hi Hazel. \n(BEAT) How would you like to go on a picnic? \nINT HAZEL'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER Gus is with Frannie and Michael downstairs. \nFRANNIE Something to drink? \nGUS I'm great Mrs. Lancaster. \nMeanwhile, upstairs, Hazel gets ready for the date. She's put the orange flowers in a toothbrush holder and is putting on LIP GLOSS. She can faintly hear the conversation downstairs. ANGLE ON Gus sitting on the stairs. Michael next to him. \nMICHAEL You're a survivor yourself? \nGUS (taps his leg) Didn't cut this fella off for the hell of it. Though it is an excellent weight-loss strategy. Legs are heavy! \nMICHAEL How's your health now? \nGUS N-E-C for fourteen months. \n", "test2_id": 832, "test3_input": "GUS (CONT'D) I don't know. They said they'd get me another one but I wanted... to do it myself. Do one little thing myself. Hazel doesn't know what to do. \nHAZEL I can't fix this. I have to call someone. I'm sorry. \nGUS No, Hazel, please! But she must. She gets out her cell phone and dials. At which point, Gus really loses it, weeping like the poisoned, dying teenage boy that he is. As Hazel dials, we hear: \nHAZEL (V.O.) I wish I could say Augustus Waters kept his sense of humor till the end, did not for a moment waiver in his courage and his spirit soared like an eagle to the sky... \nGUS (to himself, shaking) I hate myself I hate myself I hate this I hate this... \nHAZEL (V.O.) ...but that is not what happened. LATER. An EMT loads Gus into the back of an AMBULANCE. Hazel is allowed to ride with him in the back. As the car starts moving, Gus grabs her hand. \nGUS Read me something. \nHAZEL Read you something? \nGUS Do you know any poems? \nHAZEL I know one. \nGUS Read it to me. \nHAZEL \"The Red Wheelbarrow\" by William Carlos Williams. (beat, tries to remember) \"So much depends / upon / a red wheel / barrow / glazed with rain / water / beside the white / chickens.\" \nGUS \n(BEAT) Is that it? That is it. But there's another ten minutes of driving to do. Hazel thinks fast. \nHAZEL No of course not. Um... what else... \n(THINKS) so much depends/ upon a blue sky/ cut open by the branches/ of the trees./ So much depends/ on the transparent G-tube/ erupting from the belly/ of the blue-lipped boy. Gus smiles, weakly, barely conscious. Hazel cradles his head in her arms. And continues... \nHAZEL So much depends upon this observer/ of the universe... As Gus is drifting off to sleep, WE HEAR: \nHAZEL (V.O.) One of the less bull-shitty conventions of the cancer genre is the convention known as the \"Last Good Day...\" \nEXT GUS'S HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY Gus comes home from the hospital. He does not look good - but he lives. Hazel is there to help get him inside. \nINT GUS'S HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY Gus no longer sleeps in his basement. Nor does he sleep in his own bed. He sleeps in a HOSPITAL BED set up in a guest room. Hazel is with him. They're watching sports on TV. \nHAZEL (V.O.) This is where the victim of cancer finds himself unexpectedly with some hours... \nEXT GUS'S BACKYARD PORCH - ANOTHER DAY Hazel and Gus getting some fresh air. She sits there reading a book. Gus just sits there. His eyes staring off into nothing. Hazel waves to him. Gus looks over, as if waking from a dream. She manages a smile. He manages one back. \nHAZEL (V.O.) ... when it seems like the inexorable decline has suddenly plateaued, when the pain is for a minute bearable. \nINT HAZEL'S DINING ROOM - ANOTHER DAY Hazel sits at dinner with her parents. She is barely touching her food. \nHAZEL (V.O.) The problem, of course, is that there's no way of knowing that your last good day is your \"Last Good Day.\" At the time, it's just another decent day. The phone buzzes and Hazel answers it. \nHAZEL Hi, Augustus. \nGUS (O.S.) Good evening, Hazel Grace. His voice is strong today, and Hazel is happy to hear it. \nGUS (O.S.) Quick question for you. Did you ever write that eulogy I asked you to prepare? \nHAZEL I may have... \nGUS Excellent. Do you think you could find yourself at the Literal Heart of Jesus in 20 minutes. \nHAZEL Um... sure. Is everything -- \nGUS (O.S.) I love you Hazel. The call ends. Hazel, confused, stands to go. \nHAZEL I gotta go. \nFRANNIE Finish eating first. \nHAZEL I can't, I have to meet Gus. \n", "test3_true": "HAZEL I'm not hungry. \nFRANNIE You can't not eat, Hazel. \nHAZEL I am aggressively unhungry, ok? \nMICHAEL \nHAZEL -- \nHAZEL I have to go. \nFRANNIE Sit down. \nHAZEL No! \nMICHAEL Hazel, listen to your mother. Hazel tries to push past her but Frannie grabs her shoulders. \nFRANNIE You have to eat, Hazel. You're not gonna starve yourself to death just because Gus is sick. You have to stay healthy -- \nHAZEL I can't! I can't stay healthy because I'm not healthy, Mom. I am dying. I am going to die and leave you here alone and you won't have me to hover around and you won't be a mother anymore, and I'm sorry, but I can't do anything about it, ok?! Just leave me alone! Upon seeing her mother's face change, Hazel immediately regrets this. \nFRANNIE You heard me? Frannie has tears in her eyes. Hazel looks away, feeling terrible. \nFRANNIE You heard me say that to your father? Frannie sits down on the couch with her daughter. \nFRANNIE Oh god, sweetie. I'm sorry. I was wrong, ok? It wasn't true. It's not something I believe. Michael sits across from them. \nFRANNIE As long as either of us is alive, I will be your mother. Even if you die, I -- \nHAZEL When. \nFRANNIE Even when you die, I will still be your mother. I will always be your Mother. By now Michael is crying too. They all are. \nHAZEL I worry that you won't have a life. That you'll sit around all day with no me to look after and stare at the walls and be miserable or off yourselves or something. \nFRANNIE We're not gonna off ourselves. It's gonna hurt like hell to lose you \nBUT -- \nMICHAEL Hazel. You of all people know it's possible to live with pain. She takes that in. It rings true to her. Hazel nods. \nFRANNIE I don't just sit around, you know. Hazel is confused. Frannie looks at Michael like, \"should I say something?\" She goes for it. \nFRANNIE I'm taking some classes. Online. To get my master's in social work. \nHAZEL You are? Hazel is stunned. \nHAZEL So when you're waiting for me outside Support Group or whatever, you're always -- \nFRANNIE Working or reading. If I get my MSW, I can council families in crisis or lead groups dealing with \nILLNESS -- \nHAZEL Why didn't you tell me? Frannie and Michael don't quite know what to say. \nMICHAEL We didn't want you to feel \nABANDONED -- \nHAZEL Are you kidding? Mom, this is awesome! This is fantastic! Oh my god! Hazel grabs her Mom for a hug. \nHAZEL I'm so excited! You're gonna be so great, Mom! \nFRANNIE Thank you. That means everything to me. Mom and Daughter hug. And when it's over: \nFRANNIE I'd still really like you to eat. \n", "test3_id": 833}

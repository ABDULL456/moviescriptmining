ARAGORN Wait. 
THÉODEN [In Sarumans voice.] If I go. . . Théoden dies. 
[Gandalf moves his staff sharply and Théoden flies back against the chair again.] 
GANDALF You did not kill me, you will not kill him! 
THÉODEN [in Saruman's voice] Rohan is mine! 
GANDALF Be gone!! 
[Gandalf smites Théoden as he lunges at him. Théoden is thrown back into the chair and the shot changes to Saruman flying backwards from the Palantír which he used to manipulate Théoden. He lands landing hard on the floor of Orthanc, bleeding from a gash in his forehead. In the hall, Théoden lets out a moan and slumps forward in the chair. Éowyn runs to her uncles side as he falls. Théodens head rises again and his face begins to change gradually into that of a much younger-looking man. Clarity and recognition returns to his eyes.] 
THÉODEN [Looks closely at Éowyn] I know your face. Éowyn Éowyn. 
[Éowyn weeps with joy] 
THÉODEN Gandalf? 
GANDALF Breathe the free air again, my friend. 
[The hall is shown to be filled with light again, as everyone marvels at the rejuvenation of the king.] 
THÉODEN [Standing up and looking around him.] Dark have been my dreams of late. [He looks down at his trembling hands.] 
GANDALF Your fingers would remember their old strength better... if they grasped your sword. 
[Háma runs up with his sword. Théoden reaches for it with trembling hands. He wraps his fingers around it slowly and then draws it, gazing upon the shiny steel. In a corner, Gríma trembles and tries to escape but is pulled back by Gimli. Suddenly, Théodens gaze turns to Gríma. Gríma is thrown out of the hall and down the stairs.] 
GRÍMA Argh! [Beseechingly to Théoden] I've only ever served you, my lord! 
THÉODEN [Advancing towards Gríma, holding the sword firmly in his hand] Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast! 
GRÍMA [Grovelling] Send me not from your side. 
[Théoden raises his sword to kill Gríma. Aragorn holds him back.] 
ARAGORN No, my lord! No, my lord. Let him go. Enough blood has been spilled on his account. 
[Gríma scrambles to his feet and pushes through the crowd] 
GRÍMA Get out of my way! 
HÁMA Hail, Théoden king! 
[The crowd kneels in homage before Théoden. Aragorn kneels also. Gríma rides out of Edoras. As Théoden turns to go back into the hall, he looks up.] 
THÉODEN Where is Théodred? Where is my son? 
[A white flower comes into view, held up by a hand. It is released and spirals down to land among similar flowers, in front of a tomb.] 
THÉODEN Simbelmynë. Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers. [Looks at Gandalf] Now it shall cover the grave of my son. Alas, that these evil days should be mine. The young perish and the old linger. That I should live to see the last days of my house. 
GANDALF Théodreds death was not of your making.

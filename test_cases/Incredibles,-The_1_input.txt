HELEN 
You saw him do this? 
BERNIE 
Well...not really. No. Actually, not. 
HELEN 
Oh, then how do you know it was him? 
BERNIE 
I hid a camera. Yeah, and this time, I've got him. See? You see? You don't see it? He moves! Right there! Wait, wait! Right there! Right as I'm sitting down! I don't know how he does it, but there's no tack before he moves and after he moves, there's a tack. Coincidence? I think not! 
PRINCIPAL 
Bernie... 
BERNIE 
Don't ''Bernie'' me. [screaming] This little rat is guilty! 
PRINCIPAL 
You and your son can go now, Mrs. Parr. I'm sorry for the trouble. 
BERNIE 
You're letting him go again? He's guilty! You can see it on his smug little face. Guilty, I say, guilty! 
HELEN 
Dash, this is the third time this year you've been sent to the office. We need to find a better outlet. A more...constructive outlet. 
DASH 
Maybe I could, if you'd let me go out for sports. 
HELEN 
Honey, you know why we can't do that. 
DASH 
I promise I'll slow up. I'll only be the best by a tiny bit. 
HELEN 
Dashiell Robert Parr, you are an incredibly competitive boy. And a bit of a showoff. The last thing you need is temptation. 
DASH 
You always say, ''Do your best.'' But you don't really mean it. Why can't I do the best that I can do? 
HELEN 
Right now, honey, the world just wants us to fit in, and to fit in, we just gotta be like everybody else. 
DASH 
Dad always said our powers were nothing to be ashamed of. Our powers made us special. 
HELEN 
Everyone's special, Dash. 
DASH 
Which is another way of saying no one is. 
BOY 
Hey, Rydinger. Where you headed? 
GIRL 
Hi, Tony. 
TONY 
Hey. 
BOY 
Hey, Tony, can I carry your books? 
TONY 
That's kind of funny. 
BOY 1 
Hey, Tony, do you play football? 
BOY 2 
Tony, I thought we were gonna go swimming. 
VIOLET 
He looked at me.

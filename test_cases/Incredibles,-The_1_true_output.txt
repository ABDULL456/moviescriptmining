DASH 
Come on, Violet! 
BOB 
[muttering] Darn kids. Sitting on the driveway... 
BOB 
Oh, great. 
[unintelligible muttering]

DASH 
Mom. You're making weird faces again. 
HELEN 
No, I'm not. 
BOB 
You make weird faces, honey. 
HELEN 
Do you have to read at the table? 
BOB 
Uh-huh. Yeah. 
HELEN 
Smaller bites, Dash. Yikes! Bob, could you help the carnivore cut his meat? 
DASH 
Ow. 
HELEN 
Dash, you have something you wanna tell your father about school? 
DASH 
[nervously] Well, we dissected a frog. 
HELEN 
Dash got sent to the office again. 
BOB 
[distracted] Good. Good. 
HELEN 
No, Bob, that's bad. 
BOB 
What? 
HELEN 
Dash got sent to the office again. 
BOB 
What?! What for? 
DASH 
Nothing. 
HELEN 
He put a tack on the teacher's chair...during class. 
DASH 
Nobody saw me. You could barely see it on the tape. 
BOB 
They caught you on tape and you still got away with it? Whoa! You must have been booking. How fast did you think were you going? 
HELEN 
Bob! We are not encouraging this. 
BOB 
I'm not encouraging, I'm just asking how fast... 
HELEN

CAMERA MOVES from a MEDIUM on Freddy to a CU. 
HOLDAWAY (O.S.) Didja use the commode story? 
FREDDY Fuckin-A.  I tell it real good, too. 
28     INT.  MEN'S ROOM - L.A. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT 
Freddy and Holdaway at one of their many rendezvous. Holdaway wears an extra large Lakers sweatshirt.  Freddy sits on one of the sinks, wearing his high school jacket, looking at pieces of paper stapled together. 
FREDDY What's this? 
HOLDAWAY It's a scene.  Memorize it. 
FREDDY What? 
HOLDAWAY A undercover cop has got to be Marlon Brando.  To do this job you got to be a great actor.  You got to be naturalistic.  You got to be naturalistic as hell.  If you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor, and bad acting is bull shit in this job. 
FREDDY (referring to the papers) But what is this? 
HOLDAWAY It's a amusing anecdote about a drug deal. 
FREDDY What? 
HOLDAWAY Something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job. 
FREDDY I gotta memorize all this shit? 
HOLDAWAY It's like a joke.  You remember what's important, and the rest you make your own.  The only way to make it your own is to keep sayin it, and sayin it, and sayin it, and sayin it, and sayin it. 
FREDDY I can do that. 
HOLDAWAY The things you gotta remember are the details.  It's the details that sell your story.  Now this story takes place in this men's room.  So you gotta know the details about this men's room. You gotta know they got a blower instead of a towel to dry your hands.  You gotta know the stalls ain't got no doors.  You gotta know whether they got liquid or powdered soap, whether they got hot water or not, 'cause if you do your job when you tell your story, everybody should believe it.  And if you tell your story to somebody who's actually taken a piss in this men's room, and you get one detail they remember right, they'll swear by you. 
29     INT.  FREDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Freddy paces back and forth, in and out of frame, rehearsing the anecdote.  He's reading it pretty good, but he's still reading it from the page, and every once in a while he stumbles over his words. 
FREDDY ...this was during the Los Angeles marijuana drought of '86.  I still had a connection.  Which was insane, 'cause you couldn't get weed anyfuckinwhere then.  Anyway, I had a connection with this hippie chick up in Santa Cruz. All and my friends knew it.  And they'd give me a call and say, "Hey, Freddy, you buyin some, you think you could buy me some too?" They knew I smoked, so they'd ask me to buy a little for them when I was buyin.  But it got to be everytime I bought some weed, I was buyin for four or five different people.  Finally I said, "Fuck this shit."  I'm makin this bitch rich.  She didn't have to do jack shit, she never even had to meet these people.  I was fuckin doin all the work.  So I got together with her and told her, "Hey, I'm sick of this shit.  I'm comin through for everybody, and nobody's comin through for me. So, either I'm gonna tell all my friends to find their own source, or you give me a bunch of weed, I'll sell it to them, give you the money, minus ten percent, and I get my pot for free."  So, I did if for awhile... 
Freddy exits frame 
CUT TO: 
30     EXT.  PARKING LOT - DAY 
Another empty frame, except obviously outside.  Freddy enters frame from the same direction he exited in the previous scene, finishing his sentence.  When we move to a wider shot we see Freddy performing his monolog to Holdaway in a parking lot.  Holdaway sits on the hood of his beat-up car.  Freddy paces back and forth as he performs his story. 
FREDDY ...but then that got to be a pain in the ass.  People called me on the phone all the fuckin time.  I couldn't rent a fuckin tape without six phone calls interrupting me.  "Hey, Freddy, when's the next time you're gettin some?"  "Motherfucker, I'm tryin to watch 'Lost Boys'-- when I have some, I'll let you know."  And then these rinky-dink pot heads come by--there's my friends and everything, but still.  I got all my shit laid out in sixty dollar bags.  Well, they don't want sixty dollars worth.  They want ten dollars worth.  Breaking it up is a major fuckin pain in the ass.  I don't even know how much ten dollars worth is.  "Well, fuck, man, I don't want that much around.  If I have that much around I'll smoke it."  "Hey, if you guys can't control your smokin, that's not my problem. You motherfuckers been smokin for five years, be a adult about it." Finally I just told my connection, count me out.  But as it turns out, I'm the best guy she had, and she depended alot on my business. But I was still sick to death of it.  And she's trying to talk me into not quitin. Now this was a very weird situation, 'cause I don't know if you remember back in '86, there was a major fuckin drought. Nobody and anything.  People were livin on resin and smokin the wood in their pipes for months.  And this chick had a bunch, and was beggin me to sell it.  So I told her I wasn't gonna be Joe the Pot Man anymore.  But I would take a little bit and sell it to my close, close, close friends.  She agreed to that, and said we'd keep the same arrangement as before, ten percent and free pot for me, as long as I helped her out that weekend.  She had a brick of weed she was sellin, and she didn't want to go to the buy alone... 
CUT TO: 
31     INT.  BOOTS AND SOCKS BAR - NIGHT 
Freddy, Joe, Nice Guy Eddie and Mr. White all sit around a table in a red-lighted smokey bar.  Freddy continues his story.  The crooks are enjoying the hell out of it.

Revised Final Screenplay by

Behind the main title and the credits: 
EXT. PLAINS COUNTRY - CLOSE SHOT - MOVING JUST ABOVE GROUND LEVEL - A STUDY OF HOOFPRINTS - LATE AFTERNOON 
The hoofprints are deeply etched in the ground, picking their way through scrubby desert growth. An occasional tumbleweed drifts with the light breeze across the pattern of prints; and lightly-blown soil and sand begin the work of erasing them. The CAMERA FOLLOWING the hoofprints 
RAISES SLOWLY TO: 
EXT. PLAINS COUNTRY - LONG SHOT - LATE AFTERNOON 
We see the rider now. BACK TO CAMERA, jogging slowly along -- heading down a long valley toward a still-distant ranch house with its outlying barn and corrals. 
EXT. PLAINS COUNTRY - MED. SHOT - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON 
The CAMERA FRAMES and MOVES with the lone horseman. He is ETHAN EDWARDS, a man as hard as the country he is crossing. 
Ethan is in his forties, with a three-day stubble of beard. 
Dust is caked in the lines of his face and powders his clothing. He wears a long Confederate overcoat, torn at one pocket, patched and clumsily stitched at the elbows. 
His trousers are a faded blue with an off-color stripe down the legs where once there had been the yellow stripes of the Yankee cavalry. His saddle is Mexican and across it he carries a folded serape in place of the Texas poncho... 
Rider and horse have come a long way. The CAMERA HOLDS and PANS the rider past and we see another detail; strapped onto his saddle roll is a sabre and scabbard with a gray silk sash wrapped around it... Horse and rider pass, moving closer to the ranch as a little girl and a small dog come tearing around the corner of the house. 
EXT. THE YARD OF THE EDWARDS RANCH - MED. SHOT - DEBBIE - LATE AFTERNOON 
She is staring wide-eyed at the distant horseman o.s. 
Her little dog has seen him too and is barking excitedly. 
DEBBIE quickly reaches to grab the dog by the scruff of the neck, crouching over him. Debbie is 11 years old with a piquant, memorable face. 
EXT. THE YARD - CLOSE SHOT - DEBBIE 
Here we must establish and dramatize what it is about her face that is memorable, so that if we were to see her again five or six years later, we would know it is she -- perhaps the eye color or the slant of eyebrow, or a trick of scratching bridge of nose with crooked forefinger. 
EXT. THE EDWARDS HOUSE - MED. SHOT - AARON - LATE AFTERNOON 
The ranch house is of adobe, solidly built, with a sod and cross-timbered roof, deep windows. A small gallery or porch extends across the front. AARON EDWARDS comes through the door, attracted by the dog's barking -- and then he, too, sees the approaching horseman and comes farther out -- curious but not at all apprehensive. Aaron is a lean, weathered and tired man, with a down-swept mustache; a gentler-looking man than Ethan and possibly a few years older. 
As he squints off, studying the rider, his older daughter, LUCY, comes out to stand behind him. Lucy is from 16 to 18 -- a pleasant, feminine girl. She is carrying a mixing bowl with some sort of batter in it, which she now completely forgets to whip in her interest in the approaching stranger. 
In the next instant MARTHA EDWARDS follows the daughter onto the porch. Martha is a still-lovely woman, although the years have etched fine wrinkles about her eyes and mouth, and work has worn and coarsened her hands. Those hands will never be idle when Martha is on scene... And now, while she shares the family's interest in the approaching horseman, she automatically notes that Lucy has forgotten her task -- and she takes the mixing bowl from her and stirs the batter. 
EXT. YARD OF THE EDWARDS HOUSE - FULL SHOT - LATE AFTERNOON 
Along the side of the house comes BEN EDWARDS, 14, with a man-sized armload of chunkwood clutched to his chest. He, too, has spotted the stranger and is all attention. So much so that he trips, but recovers his footing. He pauses to dump the wood into a woodbox by the door -- his eyes always riveted on the oncoming rider -- and then he moves toward the others, biting a splinter out of a finger. Beyond Ben, MARTIN PAULEY emerges from the barn and crosses the open ground heading toward CAMERA. Martin is somewhat under 20, a lithe, perfectly coordinated male animal, with Indian-straight hair and a white man's eyes. He is carrying bridle or other horse-gear. He looks to the family on the porch -- to see if they recognize the stranger -- then out again. He continues, followed by Ben, toward where 
Debbie crouches over her dog. 
EXT. PLAINS COUNTRY - LONG SHOT - ETHAN - LATE AFTERNOON 
As he rides downslope toward the house. 
THE CREDITS END. 
EXT. THE EDWARDS RANCH - MED. CLOSE SHOT - MARTHA, LUCY, AND AARON - LATE AFTERNOON 
Suddenly, Martha's eyes widen as she -- even before Aaron -- recognizes the distant rider. Her hand goes to her mouth to check the name that trembles on her lips... An instant later Aaron, too, identifies the oncoming horseman. 
AARON (incredulous) Ethan? 
He looks at her, frowning, then slowly steps out onto the hard ground. Martha hands the bowl back to Lucy and follows Aaron. 
EXT. THE YARD OF THE EDWARDS HOUSE - FULL SHOT - THE GROUP 
as Ethan rides in and sits his horse, looking down at them. There is a noticeable constraint on all of them. Finally: 
ETHAN Hello, Aaron... 
His eyes shift to Martha and hold. Ethan is, and always has been, in love with his brother's wife and she with him. 
ETHAN Martha... 
MARTHA (a bit shakily) Hello, Ethan. 
Ethan slowly, stiffly swings out of the saddle. Aaron and Martha exchange quick glances... troubled, puzzled. Aaron pastes on an uncertain smile as Ethan comes around his horse toward their side. 
AARON How's California? 
ETHAN How should I know? 
AARON But Mose Harper said... 
ETHAN That old goat still creakin' around?... Whyn't someone bury him? 
He goes to his saddle pack, begins unlacing it. Ben and Debbie have inched closer -- half-shy, half-curious. 
Debbie's dog begins sniffing at his heels. Ethan looks down at them - not unfriendly, just a man not used to children. 
ETHAN Ben, ain't you?

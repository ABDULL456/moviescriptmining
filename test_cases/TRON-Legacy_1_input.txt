TRON LEGACY 
Written by

1   INT.   CYBERSPACE 
Electric-neon netherworld.     Pulsing chromatics over jet black. 
CONSTRUCTION CREW toils to complete a vast SWITCHING NEXUS. CYPER-TECH CREWMEN and MACHINERY branded "X-NET". 
3D lattice of routers, refractors, reassemblers... New, unused data OPTIK HIGHWAY routes radiate from all sides, crossing cyberspace. 
X-Net Tactical Corps troops (herein X-Takks) patrol every inch. 
2   INT.   X-NET NEXUS - UNDER CONSTRUCTION 
DATA "TRAIN" enters. Sliver of RED DATA ENERGY shunt off, shooting into RANDOM MEMORY BUFFER - geometrically perfect lattice of PLASMA BEAMS and WHITE HOT intersection points. 
X-Takks notice, moving to investigate. 
DEEP IN THE LATTICE: 
Red data "uploads" into solid form. A RED FIGURE. We see from the back - infrared strobing DISK, etched metallic detail, lethal EDGES - 
Then slowly he - IT - turns.     Hardly a face, only data-hungry eyes, riveted to a TASK - 
TRON 2.0. 
Seriously upgraded, over-clocked, armed for trouble. The friendly hero we once knew has been re-programmed into a ruthless cyber-ninja. 
X-Takks search ten story gantries. 
TRON springs into the lattice, dodging PLASMA BEAMS, avoiding detection. Slips into: 
3   INT.   NEXUS MAIN SHAFT 
X-Takks on high alert. 
TRON slips down main shaft, freezes, confirms data.       Darts behind MAIN POWER SUPPLY. 
Pulls his DISK.     DISK opens, extends oscillating DATA KEY. 
(CONTINUED) 
3   CONTINUED: 
TRON inserts key in and ENCRYPTION PANEL.     Circuits energize. Shockwave quakes system. 
POWER SUPPLY OVERLOADS, SHORTING OUT. 
X-Takks spot TRON. 
X-TAKKS Intruder!   Fix coordinates! 
POLICE POUNCE, FIRING. 
Tron pulls hyper-disk off his back and HURLS IT - 
DISK strikes cop, fries his circuits. Disk ricochets, brutally accurate, takes out three more Police - 
TRON flips into the air - His DISK boomerangs straight for him. Certain death. But his timing is inhumanly accurate. DISK docks on his back midair, lands and bolts. 
ALARMS WAIL - 
POWER SUPPLY VERGES on MELTDOWN, CIRCUITS FRY, PLASMA SPEWS. X-NET CRISIS TEAM rushes in, inserts MASTER KEY. POWER SUPPLY STABILIZES. Catastrophe averted. 
TRON flips away, chased by firing X-Takks - 
Arriving on the scene - split-second response: 
Elite team of X-NET SECURITY AGENTS, lead by: 
RX23 SECURITY LEADER (Cyber-twin of our real-world hero RUSH). 
TRON jumps down MAIN SHAFT - a thousand stories. Riding his DISK as a heat shield dodges X-Net fire, swerves into a DATA CHANNEL - 
RX23 and a pair of his AGENTS hop on PULSE RIDER vehicles, hotly pursuing TRON. 
TRON PLUNGES onto a DATA HIGHWAY - speed out of NEXUS, hurls across cyberspace. 
AGENT 1 This is the first time an Intruder has broken into X-Net! 
RX23 LEADER And it's the last. Follow him! Shut him down! 
They speed onto the OPTIK HIGHWAY. 
4   INT.   X-NET OPTIK HIGHWAY 
Broadband, light-speed OPTIK HIGHWAY.     Empty, except for: 
TRON - accelerating, escaping. 
Rx23 and AGENTS catch up fast on Pulse Rider Vehicles. 
TRON throws his disk. Blings off Agents - triggers CRASH. PLASMA BLAST rips open highway wall. 
Rx23 emerges unscathed, pursuing. 
5   EXT.   CYBERSPACE - ANCIENT SYSTEM ZONE 
TRON leaps out blast hole, recovers his disk, vanishes into ANCIENT SYSTEM ZONE.

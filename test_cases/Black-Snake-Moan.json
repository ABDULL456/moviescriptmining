But in these times, when our spirit lies in shadow. When we are lost. \nLaz crosses to Rose's booth -- the distance seems to stretch out into eternity. \nR.L. (V.O.) We ask that you give us strength. Give us strength that surpasses all understanding. In your name we pray. Amen. \nLaz sits across from his wife. \nROSE Can't remember the last time I saw you in that suit. \nLAZARUS Your mother's funeral. I's a pallbearer, remember? \nThe waitress is kind and twangy as she asks for their order. \nWAITRESS Can I start you both off with some coffee 'fore I take your order? \nROSE We won't be stayin' long.

Folks get sick. But you do what you can to get on the mend. Our marriage... it just got sick. That's all. \nROSE Talk to me about sick. Ain't been right since I moved into that drafty house. \nLAZARUS I keep the heat on. \nROSE That damned, rusty, radiator, bout burned the skin off my legs each time I passed. \nLAZARUS Kept us warm for twelve years. \nIt's over.

You can't say nothin'... \nLAZARUS If we get with a counselor. At the church, maybe they's... \nROSE (the final interruption) I don't love ya no more. \nThe words are daggers. Laz is wounded beyond concealment. Rose picks up her purse, preparing to leave. \nROSE I'm sorry you hurtin'. But, like I say, this the only life I got. (waits for him to respond) I said my piece. \nShe stands and attempts to walk away. Laz grips her tightly by the wrist. \nLAZARUS God forgive you, for how you done me... \nROSE Let go... \nLAZARUS My Daddy told me that a younger woman would bleed me dry. And that's what you did.

MOTEL ROOM - AFTERNOON \nTehronne is taking his time hanging his ice around his neck and wrists as he stands shirtless before the mirror.

I ain't callin' you no ho. But I ain't gonna be played like no trick, neither. Remember... you called me. \nRAE Save that hustle talk to them field ballers you sell crack to. \nTEHRONNE What'd I tell you? (kicks the bed) I don't do none of that shit no more. I'm in communications now. \nRAE Stolen phone cards and two-ways is what you sayin'. \nRae starts coughing. \nTEHRONNE Mobile technology is the new fix for these niggaz, I'm tellin' you. I'm just lookin' ahead. (takes out his wallet) Anyways, ain't no money in drugs no more with these rednecks popping cough pills like they's Skittles. Hey, that's what you need, girl. Get you some cough medicine. What, you sick? \nRAE Just a cough. Sugar and a spoonful of Jack'll do it. \nTEHRONNE (takes out money) Alright. How much you need, ho? \nRAE The hell you call me? \nTEHRONNE Eh, if the bootie fits... \nTehronne catches Rae's wrist as she goes to slap. He quickly yanks her arm behind her back and bends her backwards, shoving his face close to her own. He grips the money in a fist and cocks it to punch -- all in jest. \nTEHRONNE You gonna get rough? Is that what you doin'? \nRae's chest begins to heave with deep breaths. Tehronne looks down at her legs as she anxiously rubs them together. \nTEHRONNE (shakes his head) I swear, I seen some buck-wild bitches in my time, but you the illest I ever seen. \nRae gets control of the burning. She takes the money. \nRAE Just got a cough. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FISHERVILLE SQUARE - DAY \nRae is prancing up the walkway on the square. Two young men dressed for construction pass Rae. \nMAN It's already noon, Rae. You think that skirt should still be on? \nRAE (flips them off) If it weren't you could kiss my rebel cootch, ya faggot. \nThe men keep walking as Rae coughs. She turns toward the Fisherville Grocery. \nSANDY Cough drops or condoms? \nRae stops in her tracks, looking up at her estranged mother, SANDY, smoking a cigarette outside the grocery store. Sandy has bleached hair with dark roots. She is in her late-forties: once a sexy girl, now she's lost all her tread. \nRAE (surprised to see her) Didn't know you was workin' here now? \nSANDY I just like dressin' up in these goddamn blue vests. (takes a drag) Your money ticket get shipped today? \nRae walks away -- deeply affected by Sandy's presence. \nSANDY (calling after her) You let me know if I can be of any assistance. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

LAZARUS' HOME - DAY \nLaz opens his own door with caution. He turns to see Rae sprawled in his kitchen in her panties and T-shirt. He rushes to her side. \nLAZARUS Gal? Miss Rae? Rae, you hear me? \nLazarus lifts her sweaty body off the floor and moves her back to the couch. \nConsciousness briefly returns to Rae in her feverish haze. \nFLASH TO: \nCLOSE UP - FLASHBACK \nThe white-knuckled hand clutched around her mouth. \nFLASH BACK TO: \nINT. LAZARUS' HOME - DAY \nRae flinches and flails. She falls to the floor. \nLAZARUS Hold on, now. Hold on! \nRae's eyes are open and filled with fear. She struggles to flee as Laz holds her in place, trying to reassure her. \nLAZARUS Now, I ain't gonna hurt'cha. Calm down, Miss. (she fights, coughs) Listen... Listen... LISTEN NOW, GAL! (Rae settles in his grip) I ain't gonna hurt ya, hear? Gotta get you well. Now, look me... HEY! Look me in the eye. \nRae is too weak to talk or move. Laz clutches her small face in his dark hands. \nLAZARUS Open your eyes. Go'on, now. You need to see, ain't no harm here. Ain't no harm. (Rae calms) My name is Lazarus Woods. And I ain't gonna let you die. \nRae's eyes roll back. \nLazarus looks terrified as she cranes her head back and forward. Her mouth opens. \nIn her sickened state, with the force of something evil and deep inside, Rae clasps her open mouth over Laz's. A shriek sounds in his brain as he holds her tighter, allowing the kiss to grow in intensity. Rae falls to her stomach as Laz abruptly stands and stumbles across the room. What he sees chills him to the bone. \nRae is writhing on the floor as if she is possessed -- a rant of raspy words pour from her mouth. \nRAE ...you don't... touch me... s'no... NO! Mm-mm... Mm-MMMMMMMMMMMMM! N- N'you FUCK! \nLazarus gets spooked by what he is seeing. He looks to the mantle. His weathered Bible lies in a coat of dust. He picks it up as a wave of the burning hits Rae. \nShe clutches her breast and crotch, rolling from side to side. \nRAE Mm-mm... mm-mm... Ma-muh... Ma-MUH! (sudden anger, shouting) See... S... See if'I GIVE... GIVE'A... SHIT... \nFLASH TO: \nINT. DUNN'S CAFE - MORNING - FLASHBACK \nRose is shouting at the customers in the cafe. Her eyes are white like Rae's.

LAZARUS' HOME - DAY \nLaz runs out of his own home, not even shutting the door behind him. He gets half way down his drive, the Bible still clutched in his hand. He stops. \nIn a panic, Laz opens his Bible, places it down on the drive, face up, creating a barrier to evil. He hears a choking cough inside the house. Rae is fighting for breath beyond the dark door. \nSilence. Laz reaches down and picks up his Bible. \nA passage catches his eye. As he reads, the fear vanishes from his face. His back straightens. His jaw tightens. He looks back at his house, his faith is renewed. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LAZARUS'S HOME - THE BATHROOM - DAY \nThe Bible is slammed down on top of the toilet tank.

Gotta break that fever now. (Rae sobs, struggles) Don't mean to hurt'chu. But I ain't lettin' you die. (holding her down) I AIN'T LETTIN' YOU DIE! \nRae is motionless. Exhausted. Her eyes are open but blind. Her lip trembles. Her body shakes from the freezing water. \nLaz rubs the hair from her face gently. He reaches over to the Bible on the toilet and opens it to read. \nLAZARUS Put fear of the Devil in me, gal. Got me spooked like I's a kid, I tell you. (flips through the pages) But the good Lord, He showed me what to do. He come knockin' like my man R.L. say... listen here... (Rae sobs like a child) This here Matthew. He talkin' on how Jesus was healin' the sick. And a man come up to the disciples and he say... (reads deliberately) Have mercy on my son, for he is a lunatic, and sore vexed... (to Rae) He got the devil in his mind and sores on his skin. (reads) And he brought the boy to the disciples, but they could NOT cure him. \nRae's shivering is abating. Her eyes fight to stay open. Laz touches her forehead to test her temperature. \nLAZARUS (reading) Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation... how long shall I suffer you? Bring the boy hither to me. And Jesus rebuked the devil. (to Rae) You hear that? (reads) Then the disciples say... Why could not we cast the devil out? And Jesus said unto them... \nRae's eyes begin to close. Laz gently touches her head to rile her awake. \nLAZARUS Listen now... This what he sayin' to us. He say... (reads) If ye have faith... if ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto a mountain, remove hence... and it... shall... move. And nothin'... nothin' shall be impossible to you. (to Rae) You hear that? You just need a bit of faith. You just gotta believe you gonna get well, like I do. \nHe touches her forehead again. Her eyes close. \nLAZARUS That's better. You coolin' down. Okay. You rest. Okay. You rest. \nLaz leans against the wall, spent. \nEXT. LAZARUS' HOME - SUNSET \nThe cicadas sing in a rising chorus as the clouds above fade from copper to crimson. \nFADE TO BLACK. \nINT. LAZARUS' HOME - NIGHT \nThe faint echo of Rae's fevered panting. \nShe lies on the couch wrapped in a quilt, shivering. Her eyes remain closed, her face drenched with sweat. Laz has cleaned her facial wounds, using a few Band-Aids. \nBOOM! \nAn explosion ignites the windows surrounding the cabin. Rae jolts awake, terror pervades her as she gasps at the fire ball outside the window. \nShe struggles to her feet and listens. A faint sound can be heard through the roar of the flames. beep beep... beep beep... beep beep... beep beep... \nRAE (a whisper) Ronnie... \nRae stumbles to the door, weak and dizzy. She grips the door knob and pulls the door open. \nEXT. LAZARUS' HOME - NIGHT \nRae races outside, tripping down the front porch steps. She looks off at the blaze in the squash field. She frantically races toward the fire, the beeping increases. \nRAE Ronnie... RONNIE! \nBEEP BEEP... BEEP BEEP... BEEP BEEP... BEEP BEEP... \nAt the center of the blaze is an upside down Humvee. To the left of the vehicle, a few soldier's bodies lay scattered. Rae's legs lose all strength, she collapses and crawls across the squash plants. \nA far away voice is heard over the roaring flames. \nLAZARUS Gal? Gal? \nRae crawls across a fallen soldier, following the sound of Ronnie's alarm. She struggles to breathe, she almost faints. \nShe finds a soldier face down. With all her strength she turns him over. It is Ronnie, wide-eyed and lifeless. \nAn awful groan comes out of Rae -- crippling sorrow. She pulls on his vest trying to wake him. \nRAE (sobbing) Nn-nn... Nn-nn... no... N'RONNIE! \nLAZARUS GAL! YOU HEARIN' MY VOICE? \nRae looks up. The flaming humvee is gone. She is not pulling on Ronnie's vest, but the tangled vines of a squash plant. \nLaz stands at a safe distance, silhouetted in moonlight. \nLAZARUS You travelin' right now, gal. You asleep and you don't even know it. (extends his hand) Now... come on inside with me. \nRae looks like a terrified child. Her eyes well with tears as she shakes her head. Laz takes a step toward her. \nRAE Mm-mm... Mm-mm... \n", "test2_id": 1021, "test3_input": "LAZARUS This ain't got nothin' to do with that woman. Just don't want nobody around me now. \nR.L. Somethin' wrong with ya phone? Been callin' the last few days. \nR.L. stops in his tracks as Lazarus pulls out his hunting rifle from the rack behind his seat in his truck. \nR.L. Goin' dove huntin'? \nLAZARUS You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time. \nR.L. You sayin' that gun's for me if I don't? \n(LAZ CAN'T ANSWER) Spell it out, Laz. Man big enough to pull a gun best have a tongue in his mouth if he ain't got a brain in his head. \nLaz is struggling. The rifle feels suddenly strange to him. \nLAZARUS You ain't gonna talk me outta shit no more. I got my mind made up and I ain't gonna be moved on this. \nR.L. (amused) Ain't gonna be moved? \nLAZARUS Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say... \nR.L.

He is pointing a gun at his only friend. \nR.L. snatches the rifle out of Laz's hands. \nR.L. Ought'a stomp yo ass pointing this at me. (unloads the rifle) Always gotta bring up the preachin'. Like you just a sheep in my flock and all I'm good for is poundin' on a pulpit. (gets in Laz's face) Dammit, Laz... we may not be blood. But we sucked off the same old nurse since the day we was slapped on the ass. And you gonna point a gun at me? \nA tear rolls down Laz's cheek. The shame is unbearable. \nR.L. If you in some trouble, than WE gonna figure somethin' out. You and me. (hands him a bandana) Wipe your face! \nLaz takes the bandana and wipes the tears away. \nR.L. Now... this got anything to do with Rose? (Laz shakes his head) Then what? \nCUT TO: \nINT. LAZARUS' HOME - AFTERNOON \nThe door creaks open. R.L. carefully steps inside.

LAZARUS' HOME - AFTERNOON \nR.L. shakes his head as Laz follows him off the porch. \nR.L. Are you outta ya GODDAMN MIND? \nLAZARUS Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done. \nR.L. A naked woman, chained in ya house? \nLAZARUS I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I found her beat. Left for dead. So I brung her home. \nR.L. Laz, I know about that girl. (beat) Good number of this town's sinners got my ear, you know. (shakes his head) Oh, Laz. She's had a mess of crabs and them STD's. What'chu thinking? \nLAZARUS I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this. \nR.L. You say she was beat on. You call the sheriff on that? \nLAZARUS Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. I been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby. \nR.L. What's that chain around her for? \nLaz briefly looks off at the barn, knowing Lincoln is there. \nLAZARUS Why don't you go'on and ask her. She need to talk wit somebody with sense. Folks been ruttin' and beatin' on this gal all her days. And this is how I'm handling it. \nR.L. THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT? THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT? \nSilence. \nLAZARUS Go in and talk to her.

LAZARUS' BARN - AFTERNOON \nLaz opens the door to his barn wide, allowing the afternoon light to find Lincoln sitting on an old tire, weeping. \nLAZARUS Did I hurt'chu? \nLincoln shakes his head. Laz carefully sits next to him. \nLAZARUS What happened in there... that won't your fault. Ain't a young man alive could keep they britches on with that girl being in heat like she is. \nLINCOLN Why she got a chain on her? \nLAZARUS That's between her and me. It's private. And I don't want you goin' off and tellin' ya daddy. \nLINCOLN (in a panic) Please don't tell my daddy. \nLAZARUS My mouth is shut, boy. And that's how we gonna keep it. Don't go braggin' to ya buddies, ya heard me? \nLincoln nods. Laz hands him the bandana R.L. gave him. \nLAZARUS So... (a bonding smile) That your first time? \nLINCOLN Yes'sir. \nLAZARUS You struck some gold, didn't ya? \nLincoln grins as he wipes the snot from his nose. \nLAZARUS Shit. My first time was with my second cousin behind my uncle's barn. She weighed two tons, if a pound. Could'a done a lot better for myself. You sho'nuf did. \nINT. LAZARUS' HOME - AFTERNOON \nR.L. hands Rae a glass of water. She is seated on the sofa, wrapped in a quilt. \nRAE Thank you. \nR.L. (sits next to her) I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this? \nRAE (shrugs at first, then:) You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. Guess he just don't think it's safe for me. \nR.L. So he got it into his head that the only thing gonna keep you from endin' up bleedin' on the side of the road again, without a stitch of clothing on is... (R.L. yanks on the chain) You think he's crazy for thinkin' that? \nRae struggles to answer. Something is on her mind. \nRAE You a preacher? \nR.L. That's right. \nRAE Can I ask you a question? (R.L. nods) People always say, you gotta get good with Jesus, if you want not to go to hell. That you say sorry for all you done and... and Jesus would let you go on to heaven. \nR.L. You could put it that way. \nRAE But that's so fuckin' stupid. (she catches herself) I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse. \nR.L. What's on your mind? \nRAE You can't hurt people... and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that. People who... do what they want and then... switch. \nR.L. I'm gonna tell you somethin', and it's just gonna be between you and me. (Rae anxiously nods) I think folks carry on about heaven too much. Like it's some all-you-can- eat buffet up in the clouds. And folks just gonna do as they're told so they can eat what they want behind some pearly gates. I can go to Shoney's for that. \nRae grins. R.L. leans closer. \nR.L. There's sin in my heart. There's evil in this world. But when I got no one... I talk to God. I ask for strength. I ask for forgiveness. Not for peace at the end of my days when there's no more life to live and no more good to do, but today. Right now. \nRae has never had anyone talk to her like this. She is listening. She is understanding. \nR.L. What's your heaven? What gives you peace? \nRae looks at her bare feet. She tries to respond but the pain in her chokes back the words. Tears come to her. \nRAE (struggling to speak) Ronnie. \n", "test3_id": 1022}

{"train": "BLACK SNAKE MOAN \nWritten by \nCraig Brewer \nOnly one kind of blues... And that consists between male and female. - Son House \nEXT. RONNIE'S TRAILER - EARLY DAWN \nRAE is naked. \nWrapped around her shoulders is a loose-knit spread that conceals her slender form. She is in her 20's: a strawberry blond, with cinnamon freckles spotted across her pale skin. She is beautiful without trying. \nShe stares at the distant trees. This is the South; the small town of FISHERVILLE, TENNESSEE. \nSoon Rae will be alone. \nCUT TO: \nINT. RONNIE'S TRAILER - EARLY MORNING \nRONNIE is 25 years old. His hair is cropped in a military issue buzz. \nRae's face is wet with tears as Ronnie gently makes love to her. She touches his face and sobs like a child. \nCUT TO: \nINT. RONNIE'S TRAILER - LATER THAT MORNING \nRONNIE is dressed in his National Guard fatigues, packing up his gear. \nRae is now wearing a short jeans skirt and a T-shirt with a gray wolf print ironed on the front. There is a knock at the door. Rae flinches. Ronnie opens the door revealing GILL MORTON, Ronnie's buddy from high school. \nGILL Still need a lift? \nRONNIE Yeah. Transmission's shot. \nGill and Rae's eyes meet. Gill sees that Rae is crying. \nGILL Gonna have a smoke. \nRonnie shuts the door and feels a wave of sudden nausea. He rushes past Rae. \nRONNIE Shit... \nINT. RONNIE'S TRAILER - BATHROOM - MORNING \nRonnie is vomiting into the toilet as Rae rubs his head. Each painful dry heave makes Rae comfort him more. \nRAE Baby... \nEXT. RONNIE'S TRAILER - MORNING \nRonnie places his duffle bag in Gill's truck. Rae begins to cough. \nGILL You sick? \nRae doesn't answer. \nGill backs away, allowing Ronnie and Rae some privacy. The two lovers stare into each others eyes and then embrace. \nRae peeks over Ronnie's shoulder at Gill with an expression of dread. Anger seizes her. \nRAE This ain't gonna work. \nRONNIE Rae... \nRAE I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and I know this ain't gonna work. \nRONNIE (holds her face in his hands) Rae don't do this now... \nRAE It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid! \nRONNIE Rae! \nSilence. Rae melts. Tears stream down her face. \nRONNIE (reaches in his pocket) Look it. I got somethin' for us. This is gonna help, okay. \nGILL You gonna miss your bus. \nRonnie removes a small digital watch and fastens it around her wrist. \nRONNIE This watch here is gonna beep at midnight. Every night. That's when it comes up on you the hardest, right? \nR.L.'s prayer is heard as Laz opens the front door to the cafe. He looks ill. Each step is painful. \nR.L. (V.O.) We do not question your divine plan for us, Oh God. But in these times, when our spirit lies in shadow. When we are lost. \nLaz crosses to Rose's booth -- the distance seems to stretch out into eternity. \nR.L. (V.O.) We ask that you give us strength. Give us strength that surpasses all understanding. In your name we pray. Amen. \nLaz sits across from his wife. \nROSE Can't remember the last time I saw you in that suit. \nLAZARUS Your mother's funeral. I's a pallbearer, remember? \nThe waitress is kind and twangy as she asks for their order. \nWAITRESS Can I start you both off with some coffee 'fore I take your order? \nROSE We won't be stayin' long. Coffee'll be fine. \nThe waitress leaves. The sounds of the cafe fill the silence. \nROSE We leavin' this weekend. Deke got a friend in Mobile gonna get him a job at the water company... \nLAZARUS (interrupting) If you come to talk about that muthafucka, I'm gonna get up and leave you sittin' pretty in that new suit he bought'cha. \nROSE Think this about money still, ya old fool? \nLAZARUS Say what you gotta say, but I ain't gonna hear you speak his name to me. Not never. You hear? \nROSE How many times we been over this, Laz? How many times? \nThe waitress places the coffee between them and leaves. \nROSE Thought we was gonna be friendly about this. \nLAZARUS Carryin' on behind my back. Make me out to look like a fool to all our people. Tell me, what's friendly about that? \nROSE I'm not ready to grow old, Laz. Livin' with you. I feel it. Like I'm one foot in the dirt. Saw it happen to my momma. And that's not gonna happen to me. I got living to do. \nLAZARUS And you gonna live it with him? \nRose doesn't answer. Lazarus softens, touching her hand. \nLAZARUS Rose. Folks get sick. But you do what you can to get on the mend. Our marriage... it just got sick. That's all. \nROSE Talk to me about sick. Ain't been right since I moved into that drafty house. \nLAZARUS I keep the heat on. \nROSE That damned, rusty, radiator, bout burned the skin off my legs each time I passed. \nLAZARUS Kept us warm for twelve years. \nIt's over. Laz has lost her for good. \nROSE I deserve better than this. \nLAZARUS Better'n me? \nROSE Better than what you give. \nLAZARUS Rose... please... \nROSE Laz... You can't say nothin'... \nLAZARUS If we get with a counselor. At the church, maybe they's... \nROSE (the final interruption) I don't love ya no more. \nThe words are daggers. Laz is wounded beyond concealment. Rose picks up her purse, preparing to leave. \nROSE I'm sorry you hurtin'. But, like I say, this the only life I got. (waits for him to respond) I said my piece. \nShe stands and attempts to walk away. Laz grips her tightly by the wrist. \nLAZARUS God forgive you, for how you done me... \nROSE Let go... \nLAZARUS My Daddy told me that a younger woman would bleed me dry. And that's what you did. Ya bled me. \nROSE Let go of my arm... \nLAZARUS Would'a chopped my arm off if you asked. And this how you do me! \nKELL Satellites... You mean in space? \nCONNER Uh-huh. \nKELL Good thing you can block, Conner, cuz you're dumb as a sack of shit. \nJesse notices Rae coughing. She pulls her aside as Conner rambles. \nJESSE You wanna go home? \nRAE It gets worse there. Leavin' me to my own mind. That's just not good. \nJESSE (pours a shot of vodka) Here. Pound this and I'll join you. \nRae and Jesse take a strong shot. It burns. \nJESSE One more. Fuck the chaser. \nAs they pound one more, Rae notices Gill, Ronnie's friend, staring at her from across the room. \nJESSE Better? \nRAE Yeah. \nBATSON and MARK approach Jesse and Rae. They are both sophomores, both skinny and harmless. \nBATSON Hey, Jess. \nJESSE Boys. \nBATSON You robotrippin' tonight? \nJESSE I'm just gonna smoke. \nRae peeks at Gill maneuvering through the room. \nBATSON (rummages in his pockets) Got eight packs of DXM. Oxycontin. Got a shit load of Coricidin if you want to get out-a-body, n'all. \nJESSE You just trying to get me outta my clothes. \nRAE Be right back. \nRae pushes through the crowd of drunken kids to get to Gill. \nRAE It's not like I can't go out and have fun with my friends. \nGILL You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. You think he's gonna be thinkin' about you? \nRAE You go to hell. \nRae pushes through the crowd, back toward the others. \nRAE (to Batson) How many to fuck me up? \nQUICK CUTS of: Batson popping out five red cough pills. Rae swallowing all five and chasing them with vodka. Conner's girl falls off his lap. Kell laughs. The laughter echoes and grows as we: \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CONNER'S HOUSE - THE KEGGER - HIS PARENT'S WATERBED - NIGHT \nCLOSE ANGLES: We never quite see the whole of what is implied. Rae's eyes, Jesse's mouth, a boy's shoulder. \nThe room is packed with bodies. Rae laughs with pleasure as her eyes attempt to focus. The kid on top of her finishes and rolls off. \nJESSE What's so funny? \nJesse is straddling a guy in an arm chair, Chinese-eyed and bouncing. Rae tries to respond coherently as another football player rolls her over on all fours and takes her from behind. \nRAE (laughing) Oh... I'm just on a water bed... And it's just... so... Goddamn... funny! \nA few coughs. Rae focuses to see a younger guy sitting at her eye level. \nRAE Hi. \nBRYAN Hey. \nRAE You ain't the kicker, are you? \nBRYAN No, ma'am. \nRAE Cuz let me tell you, you boys gotta run the ball more. You get into a kicking game, ya'll gonna lose. \nBRYAN Can I put it in your mouth? \nRAE Okay. \nAn old black man named RED sits on a bench next to an older white man in his early eighties holding a cane. RED is the paid caretaker of MELVIN. \nMELVIN How's the squash this year? \nLAZARUS It's good, Mister Melvin. I'll bring ya some. \nLaz rushes inside. \nINT. MACON DRUGS - AFTERNOON \nThe variety of cough medicine confuses Laz as he examines them. \nANGELA approaches Laz. She is dressed in a floral print dress with a white lab coat. Angela has a few extra pounds on her but she wears it well with her caring face and sweet manner. \nANGELA Lazarus? \nLAZARUS (startled) Oh! Gave me a start. \nANGELA I'm sorry. It's these soft shoes I wear for my back. \nLAZARUS You hurt it? \nANGELA I'm standing most of my day. They're for support. (a smile) Didn't see you in church this mornin'. \nLAZARUS (tries to lie) Been on the crop. May need to get some extra hands if I don't want to work on Sundays. \nANGELA Well. It's good to see you. \nAngela wants the conversation to continue but Laz remains silent. She smiles awkwardly. \nLAZARUS Angela? \nANGELA Yes? \nLAZARUS I need to uh... \nANGELA Go on, Laz. You can talk to me. \nLAZARUS My little niece... she got this deep cough. \nANGELA You take her to a doctor? \nLAZARUS (struggles to lie) No. No, she can't go. Mean to say... they's just no money fo'a doctor. Her daddy left for a job, and uh... give her to me to look on. I just... (a pitiful pause) I don't know what to do. \nAngela thinks for a moment. \nANGELA You wait right here. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LAZARUS' HOME - DAY \nSnot and spittle has run down the side of Rae's face -- her eyelids stick together as she tries to open them. \nThere is a creak, followed by another. Rae has become aware that someone is slowly walking up the front porch. \nThe door opens. Silhouetted in the day's blinding light is a white man in his 40's. His face is indistinguishable to Rae's affected gaze. \nIs this a dream? \nHe stands above her and lights a cigarette. The Zippo lighter clasps shut. The man lowers it to his side where Rae can see it clearly. A bald eagle is printed on the side, a sight that makes Rae's eyes open wide in horror. \nHer breath grows deeper -- a girlish plea. This is no dream -- it's a nightmare. \nRAE Mm-mm... Mm-mm... \nA massive hand slaps down over her mouth. Her crusted eyes peer above the hairy knuckles. He sucks on the cigarette. A red cherry blazes at the end. The man pushes the blanket off of her and grips her panties. \nRae's eyes close. She knows what is next. In his clenched fist, the panties are ripped off. \nRAE NOOOOO! \nRae flinches awake from the fever-induced nightmare and falls to the wooden floor, drenched in sweat. Weakened and shaking, she scampers away, finally collapsing in the kitchen. Her hand reaches out and lands on the strings of Laz's guitar on the floor. She grips the steel strings with her trembling fingers. \nA single bass note twangs as she passes out. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MACON DRUGS - AFTERNOON \nAngela stands between the aisles, motioning Laz to approach, away from the girl at the counter. \nANGELA Is your niece older than 12? \nLAZARUS Oh, she older than that. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LAZARUS' HOME - DAY \nLaz opens his own door with caution. He turns to see Rae sprawled in his kitchen in her panties and T-shirt. He rushes to her side. \nLAZARUS Gal? Miss Rae? Rae, you hear me? \nLazarus lifts her sweaty body off the floor and moves her back to the couch. \nConsciousness briefly returns to Rae in her feverish haze. \nFLASH TO: \nCLOSE UP - FLASHBACK \nThe white-knuckled hand clutched around her mouth. \nFLASH BACK TO: \nINT. LAZARUS' HOME - DAY \nRae flinches and flails. She falls to the floor. \nLAZARUS Hold on, now. Hold on! \nRae's eyes are open and filled with fear. She struggles to flee as Laz holds her in place, trying to reassure her. \nLAZARUS Now, I ain't gonna hurt'cha. Calm down, Miss. (she fights, coughs) Listen... Listen... LISTEN NOW, GAL! (Rae settles in his grip) I ain't gonna hurt ya, hear? Gotta get you well. Now, look me... HEY! Look me in the eye. \nRae is too weak to talk or move. Laz clutches her small face in his dark hands. \nLAZARUS Open your eyes. Go'on, now. You need to see, ain't no harm here. Ain't no harm. (Rae calms) My name is Lazarus Woods. And I ain't gonna let you die. \nRae's eyes roll back. \nLazarus looks terrified as she cranes her head back and forward. Her mouth opens. \nIn her sickened state, with the force of something evil and deep inside, Rae clasps her open mouth over Laz's. A shriek sounds in his brain as he holds her tighter, allowing the kiss to grow in intensity. Rae falls to her stomach as Laz abruptly stands and stumbles across the room. What he sees chills him to the bone. \nRae is writhing on the floor as if she is possessed -- a rant of raspy words pour from her mouth. \nRAE ...you don't... touch me... s'no... NO! Mm-mm... Mm-MMMMMMMMMMMMM! N- N'you FUCK! \nLazarus gets spooked by what he is seeing. He looks to the mantle. His weathered Bible lies in a coat of dust. He picks it up as a wave of the burning hits Rae. \nShe clutches her breast and crotch, rolling from side to side. \nRAE Mm-mm... mm-mm... Ma-muh... Ma-MUH! (sudden anger, shouting) See... S... See if'I GIVE... GIVE'A... SHIT... \nFLASH TO: \nINT. DUNN'S CAFE - MORNING - FLASHBACK \nRose is shouting at the customers in the cafe. Her eyes are white like Rae's. Her voice is not her own but that of Rae. \nROSE/RAE (screaming) 'BOUT ANY OF YOU PEOPLE! \nFLASH BACK TO: \nEXT. LAZARUS' HOME - DAY \nLaz runs out of his own home, not even shutting the door behind him. He gets half way down his drive, the Bible still clutched in his hand. He stops. \nIn a panic, Laz opens his Bible, places it down on the drive, face up, creating a barrier to evil. He hears a choking cough inside the house. Rae is fighting for breath beyond the dark door. \nSilence. Laz reaches down and picks up his Bible. \nA passage catches his eye. As he reads, the fear vanishes from his face. His back straightens. His jaw tightens. He looks back at his house, his faith is renewed. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LAZARUS'S HOME - THE BATHROOM - DAY \nThe Bible is slammed down on top of the toilet tank. The bathtub faucet coughs as Laz twists the cold water knob. \nINT. LAZARUS' HOME - KITCHEN - DAY \nThe freezer door opens. He snatches four trays of ice. \nINT. LAZARUS' HOME - THE BATHROOM - DAY \nThe trays crack. The ice cubes bounce into the tub. \nINT. LAZARUS' HOME - DAY \nLAZARUS Come on, gal... \nShe turns and runs away as best she can. Laz chases after her. He's much older than her and a bit slower, but her balance betrays her. \nLaz wraps his arms around her. Rae screams to the sky. \nRAE NO! NOOO! NOOOOOOOOOO! \nAnd then, stillness. Rae lies limp in Laz's arms, unconscious. \nHe reaches down and lifts her wrist to his face. The green screen of the digital watch pulsates with the alarm. \nHe pushes the side button. The beeping stops. Silence. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LAZARUS' HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT \nLaz lays Rae back onto his couch. Her eyes open into slits. She can see Laz's form over her like the man in her nightmare. \nRae grabs Laz's wrist. He flinches with her force. \nRAE (the whisper of a child) Is'okay... Is'okay... \nStruggling with exhaustion, Rae moves Laz's hand to her bare stomach. She rubs it slowly up and down her form, suggestively. \nLaz slips his hand away and claps it tight over her eyes. Rae holds her breath, waiting to be molested, her lip quivering. \nLAZARUS (singing deep and soft) Goin' over that hill. Goin' over that hill. Well, I ain't gonna stop until I reach my God's top. I'm goin' over the hill. Well I went to the valley, I didn't go to stay. Soul got happy, I stayed all day. I'm goin' over that hill. \nRae relaxes and falls into a deep sleep. \nLaz backs away from her, a touch of fear in his heart. The voice of Tehronne is heard from earlier in the day. \nTEHRONNE (V.O.) She a freak. Got what you call a sexual addiction. \nLAZARUS (V.O.) What'chu sayin'? \nTEHRONNE (V.O.) What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy. \nFLASH TO: \nINT. POOL HALL - EARLIER THAT DAY - FLASHBACK \nLazarus looks at Tehronne with a furrowed brow, confused. \nTEHRONNE First hooked up with that bitch when she was 16. Girl was fuckin' the principal and two of her teachers. You know coach Reynolds? \nLAZARUS Uh-huh. \nTEHRONNE He tapped that. \nLAZARUS Naw! \nTEHRONNE Go ask him. \nFLASH BACK TO: \nINT. LAZARUS'S BARN - NIGHT \nLazarus opens his barn, slicing through the darkness with his flashlight. \nTEHRONNE (V.O.) She been bumpin' around all her life, hookin' up with whoever keep her fed and fucked. \nHe crosses to the other side, pulls on a beaded chain turning on the single bulb above his work table. \nTEHRONNE (V.O.) I seen her give it up on park benches, back of trucks, hoopty hoods, you name it. \nLaz opens an old wooden box on his work table. He looks inside. \nFLASH TO: \nINT. POOL HALL - MORNING - FLASHBACK \nLaz looks ill. Tehronne checks his pager briefly. \nTEHRONNE You ever seen a train run on a woman? \nLAZARUS Nuh-uh. \nTEHRONNE Meanin' like a team of fellas go to work on her and she don't even break a sweat. (puts his pager away) She into football, you know. You got a letter on your jacket you get that pussy in ya lap. I ain't playin'. \nTehronne's friend breaks on the pool table with a sharp crack. Lazarus is genuinely disturbed. \nLAZARUS How a girl get like that? \nLAZARUS Way I see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right. \nRAE The fuck you been doin' to me? \nLAZARUS I ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... Remember like I say, I found you in the road... \nRAE (yanks at the chain around her waist) Get this Goddamn thing off me! \nRae stumbles as she moves away from Laz. Laz tries to reassure her. \nLAZARUS Now, no harm's come to you... and I aim to keep it that way. Ain't gonna... gonna run a train over ya... or however you call it... see... you was runnin' wild on me... these fever dreams you was havin'... these fits. I'd be chasin' you all night. \nRAE Well I'm woke now... you can take this off. \nRae waits. \nLAZARUS Gal, you ain't right yet. \nRAE I'm right enough to stand on my own two feet. Now take this Goddamn chain off... \nLAZARUS How you let men treat ya like they do? \nRAE What? \nLAZARUS These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that? \nRAE (grips the chain) Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up? \nLAZARUS You know what I'm talkin' about. (beat) All that mess with ya teachers and... boys in the backs of trucks. \nRAE (shocked) The hell you know about me?! You got no right to talk to me about that shit! The hell you think you are? \nLAZARUS (interrupting) I've saved ya life, gal. I can do and say whatever the fuck I want. \nRae begins to feel a pang of panic. She goes to the chain locked around the radiator. She yanks on it a few times. \nLAZARUS I give ya enough chain so's you can get about the house. Get you to the kitchen. You need the bathroom, it'll reach. \nRAE What do you want? \nLAZARUS We got everything we need. Plenty of food. Ya medicine still got a few good swallows in it... \nRAE WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?! (Laz can't answer) WHATEVER YOU GONNA DO TO ME, JUST DO IT! AND LET ME GO! \nLAZARUS God saw to it to put you in my path. And I aim to cure ya of your wickedness. \nThis statement terrifies Rae. The fear can be seen in her eyes. She backs away -- the chain scrapes across the floor. \nRAE You some kind'a pervert? \nLAZARUS No ma'am. \nRAE Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me... \nLAZARUS In my house, you watch that lip... \nRAE (furious, near tears) Look it, mister... you wanna have your way, you take it. I'll do whatever you want. But you gotta let me go. You can't do this! You can't KEEP ME HERE! \nLAZARUS You sick. You got a sickness... we broke that fever... we gonna break that hold the devil got on ya. \nRae pushes Laz back and bolts for the door. Laz falls back against the side table by the couch, toppling the lamp. \nEXT. LAZARUS' HOME / INT. LAZARUS' HOME - AFTERNOON \nThe door slams against the house as Rae rushes out in her wolf shirt and panties -- the chain trailing behind her. \nRAE (screaming) HELP! \nLaz watches as the coil unravels and snaps taut, yanking on the old radiator. \nClank! The chain whips Rae down to the ground. Laz watches as dust flies of the radiator with each tug. \nRAE SOMEBODY! \nCLANK! \nThe fear in Laz's face is replaced with a grin as he watches his radiator hold firm. \nRAE SOMEBODY HELP ME! \nOutside, Rae bucks and screams, yanking on the chain like a wild mustang. Her bare feet and legs are soiled with fresh mud and grass as she claws at the ground. \nLaz crosses to the radiator and pats it like a proud parent -- his wedding ring clicks against the iron. \nLAZARUS (to the radiator) Ain't gonna be moved. \nLaz kneels next to her and gently frees her bare ankle from the tangled chain. \nLAZARUS You hungry? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LAZARUS' HOME - ON THE PORCH - LATER THAT DAY \nThey are both seated on the front porch with paper plates in their laps. Laz watches with amusement as Rae tears into her chicken and gobbles up the vegetables. \nLAZARUS I put some back ache into growin' them greens. You should slow down and see how they taste. \nRae remains under Lazarus' intense gaze as the cicadas sing. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LAZARUS' HOME - THE VEGETABLE GARDEN - SUNSET \nRae stares off at orange clouds and purple sky. She takes a step to her left, walking through the parallel rows of squash. \nThe chain gently rattles behind her. Laz has given her about 20 feet of slack. He holds the chain tight around his fist. \nRae grins, standing proud in her wolf shirt and panties. \nRAE You like this? Walkin' me through this field like I's your mule? \nLAZARUS Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong. \nRAE (sassy) If I break one you gonna shoot me? \nRae teases Laz by adjusting her panties. She turns back to the sunset and stretches. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LAZARUS' HOME - NIGHT \nRae's smoldering eyes don't leave Laz as he chains her to the radiator. Laz nervously preaches, trying to avoid the sight of her bare legs curled up on his couch. \nLAZARUS My Daddy was one of the first mens to organize soil conservation in these parts. That's a group of farmers, you know, each season they'd rotate the crop. Know why it's best to rotate em like that? \nRAE Uh-uh. \nLaz moves in close and starts applying antibacterial cream to the cut above Rae's eye. \nLAZARUS Cuz once in a while soil need a change. Corn take up a lot of nitrate in the fertilizer. So next crop what ya do is plant ya some soy beans. That give off a lot of nitrate. Change keeps it all growin' and growin' strong. (regarding the eye) Sting a bit? \nRAE Itches. \nLAZARUS Means ya healin'. (a nod) So all this farmin' make me think on Matthew. Matthew 13. The parable of the sower? Man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns... you know the story? \nRAE Uh-uh. \nLaz starts putting the cream on her scabbed knees. He rubs them gently. \nLAZARUS The seed that land on good soil is for them who hear the word of God... and understand the word of God. Not enough for you to hear what I'm sayin', you gotta understand. \nRAE I know. I get it. What's Matthew doin'? \nLAZARUS Gal... Matthew ain't doin' shit... this just a story... (quelling his frustration) Look it. I've seen it in nature, I've seen it in men. Ya got to change up your crop. Cuz that seed ain't gettin' in. (Rae remains silent) Ya gotta cut this shit out. Got no cause to be up under these fools, ruttin' on ya like you a bitch. Like you somebody's dog. No woman... who joins in union with Almighty God... or man... in the sanctity of marriage... should degrade herself... and bend to ANOTHER MAN'S WILL! \nRae is aware that Laz is somewhere else, talking to someone else other than her. There is anger in his tone as he rubs ointment on her bare, scabbed knees. \nLAZARUS (shouting) My God, gal, don't you got no SENSE? I ain't sayin' I ain't weak? Shit. Playin' guitar in the blood-bucket jukes all ya life... a nigga learn how to sin, let me tell you! (grips her by the legs) I GOT SIN IN ME! I AIN'T GO'N LIE! BUT I GOT RESPECT! AND ALL YOU GOT IS BILE, GAL! \nRAE Let go of me... \nLAZARUS GIVIN' UP THAT SWITCH LIKE A TRAMP! BEHIND MY BACK AND KILL MY BABY...! \nRae yanks free of Laz's grip, recoiling on the couch. \nRAE GET OFF ME! \nLaz awakens from his rant. He blinks and stands. A sudden shame overtakes him. He crosses into the kitchen to hide by the sink. \nHe pours Rae a glass of water and returns to her side. \nLAZARUS (offering her the glass) Didn't mean to go off on a tear like I did. I just got to thinkin' about things... \nRae leans up into his face. The glass of water is touching her chest. Laz remains hypnotized by her eyes. \nRAE Why is it you old men gotta talk so much? Like little boys, gotta talk yourself into fuckin' me. (his knuckles touch her skin) We can take our time. I'm grown. I get it. (she leans even closer) You wanna give me 'nother bath? \nLaz stands and backs away. He quickly leaves the room. \nINT. LAZARUS'S HOME - THE BEDROOM - NIGHT \nELLA MAE Well... I hope these will work for your niece. She can always come back in and swap sizes. \nLazarus points to a small display of fine lotions. \nLAZARUS Mind I ask, what's all this business here? \nELLA MAE These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion. \nLAZARUS For your hands? \nELLA MAE Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. So now they have scented creams. They help moisturize a woman's skin. (unscrewing a jar) This one's my favorite. It's called Ginger Souffle. I recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp. So... perhaps just after a shower. \nLAZARUS (likes what he smells) I'll take a jar of that, too. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LAZARUS' HOME - KITCHEN - AFTERNOON \nRae rattles into the kitchen, her damp clothes clinging to her form. She picks up Laz's guitar off the table and places it in her lap. \nShe plucks a few random strings out of boredom and smiles. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MACON DRUGS - AFTERNOON \nThe same apathetic girl is working the front counter as Laz enters the drug store with a basket of arranged vegetables. \nLAZARUS Lookin' for Miss Angela. \nGIRL She in the back. \nLaz makes his way to the back of the store. He spies Angela in the back pharmacy, sorting pills for a pick-up. He watches her work for a moment until, finally, she sees him. \nANGELA Wait right there. \nLaz waits as Angela rounds the corner. \nLAZARUS I brung you a little basket of goodies. Fresh squash, tomatoes, some okra, butter beans. \nANGELA (taking the basket) You didn't have to do this. \nLAZARUS Just wanted to say how much I appreciate you helping me the other day. My niece, she's cured up, and I got you to thank. \nANGELA Well that's good. I'm happy to hear it. \nAngela smiles. There is tension and attraction between the two. \nLAZARUS Look here. I got somethin' special for you. \nAngela is flush as Laz moves closer than he has ever been before. He reaches in the basket for the jar of cream. \nLAZARUS This here is a whipped... body cream. And it's got a smell to it. Tell me what you think. \nLaz holds the jar up to her nose. Angela closes her eyes and smells. Her expression says enough -- she loves it. \nLAZARUS They call this Ginger Souffle. Best if it... if it go on your skin just after you been in a hot tub... or shower. \nAngela takes the lotion from his hand. She is subtle and demure, but the woman is deeply affected. She smiles. \nANGELA This was very sweet of you. \nLAZARUS Well. Hope you enjoy it. \nAngela watches Laz as he walks out the door. The apathetic girl moves up behind Angela. \nGIRL Oooooo. \nANGELA Hush up. \nEXT. FISHERVILLE SQUARE - MACON DRUGS - AFTERNOON \nLaz opens his truck and waves goodbye to Old Red. Melvin is holding a healthy squash. \nRED You gonna be on the square later on? \nLAZARUS Got all my honey-do's done with. I'm headin' home. \nRED Stay cool. It's a hot one. \nLaz pulls away in his truck and rounds the corner just as R.L. crosses the street. He steps over to talk to Red. \nR.L. Hey, Red. Was that Laz just left? \nRED Yes'sir, Rev'rend. \nLAZARUS This ain't got nothin' to do with that woman. Just don't want nobody around me now. \nR.L. Somethin' wrong with ya phone? Been callin' the last few days. \nR.L. stops in his tracks as Lazarus pulls out his hunting rifle from the rack behind his seat in his truck. \nR.L. Goin' dove huntin'? \nLAZARUS You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time. \nR.L. You sayin' that gun's for me if I don't? \n(LAZ CAN'T ANSWER) Spell it out, Laz. Man big enough to pull a gun best have a tongue in his mouth if he ain't got a brain in his head. \nLaz is struggling. The rifle feels suddenly strange to him. \nLAZARUS You ain't gonna talk me outta shit no more. I got my mind made up and I ain't gonna be moved on this. \nR.L. (amused) Ain't gonna be moved? \nLAZARUS Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say... \nR.L. (still stepping closer) Or what? \nLAZARUS I told you to TURN BACK! \nR.L. pushes his chest up against the rifle and shouts back. \nR.L. YOU GO'ON AND SHOOT ME, KILLA! \nLaz's heart is breaking. He is pointing a gun at his only friend. \nR.L. snatches the rifle out of Laz's hands. \nR.L. Ought'a stomp yo ass pointing this at me. (unloads the rifle) Always gotta bring up the preachin'. Like you just a sheep in my flock and all I'm good for is poundin' on a pulpit. (gets in Laz's face) Dammit, Laz... we may not be blood. But we sucked off the same old nurse since the day we was slapped on the ass. And you gonna point a gun at me? \nA tear rolls down Laz's cheek. The shame is unbearable. \nR.L. If you in some trouble, than WE gonna figure somethin' out. You and me. (hands him a bandana) Wipe your face! \nLaz takes the bandana and wipes the tears away. \nR.L. Now... this got anything to do with Rose? (Laz shakes his head) Then what? \nCUT TO: \nINT. LAZARUS' HOME - AFTERNOON \nThe door creaks open. R.L. carefully steps inside. Rae is sitting on the couch, looking out the window. \nRAE (on the verge of tears) I didn't want to. \nRae doesn't respond. R.L. quickly steps outside shutting the door behind him. \nEXT. LAZARUS' HOME - AFTERNOON \nR.L. shakes his head as Laz follows him off the porch. \nR.L. Are you outta ya GODDAMN MIND? \nLAZARUS Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done. \nR.L. A naked woman, chained in ya house? \nLAZARUS I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I found her beat. Left for dead. So I brung her home. \nR.L. Laz, I know about that girl. (beat) Good number of this town's sinners got my ear, you know. (shakes his head) Oh, Laz. She's had a mess of crabs and them STD's. What'chu thinking? \nLAZARUS I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this. \nR.L. You say she was beat on. You call the sheriff on that? \nLAZARUS Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. I been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby. \nR.L. What's that chain around her for? \nLaz briefly looks off at the barn, knowing Lincoln is there. \nLAZARUS Why don't you go'on and ask her. She need to talk wit somebody with sense. Folks been ruttin' and beatin' on this gal all her days. And this is how I'm handling it. \nR.L. THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT? THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT? \nSilence. \nLAZARUS Go in and talk to her. Please. \nRONNIE Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside. \nGILL You need a ride? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. RONNIE'S TRAILER - NIGHT \nGill's truck rounds the bend and up the gravel drive leading up to Ronnie's trailer. \nThe headlights scan across the porch as Gill parks. \nINT. RONNIE'S TRAILER - NIGHT \nRonnie is the first through the door, calling out for Rae before he can turn on the lights. \nRONNIE Rae? \nGill enters. He sees that the trailer is the same as it was the day he picked up Ronnie, nothing is different. \nRONNIE This don't feel right. Kitchen looks just like I left it. I know, cuz I cleaned it. \nGILL She ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off? \nRONNIE I just been so mixed up lately, Gill. And, you know, with her history, I can see how she could get scared... (tears) ...and run. \nGill is disturbed by Ronnie's sudden flood of emotion and tears. He crosses to the pantry, already knowing which cupboard to pull the liquor out of. \nHe pours two drinks. He hands one to Ronnie. \nGILL Drink. Come on, drink some. \nRonnie manages a few swallows. \nRONNIE Her momma works down at the grocery, down on the square. Maybe she seen her. \nGill stands over Ronnie, looking down on his pitiful face. \nGILL Ronnie. You can't see cuz you're too close to it. (Ronnie waits) These nervous spells you get. You never had that shit back in school... \nRONNIE That's not right, really, cuz I... \nGILL (continuing) You joined up in that monkey troop cuz you had a plan for yourself. Army'd pay for school. You were gonna get a degree, maybe somethin' in business or agriculture and you were gonna make somethin' of yourself. \nHis words are painful to Ronnie. Gill doesn't hold back. \nGILL And then you had to fall in love with the school slut. \nRONNIE Now wait... \nGILL (continuing) With all she was doin'. With all the shit she kept doing! You stayed stuck to that bitch's ass and you wouldn't let go. \nRONNIE I know about how she was like. But we was different. I's the only person she talked to about it. How she's abused. Terrible things, Gill, just terrible... \nRage suddenly fills Gill. He grabs Ronnie and throws him against the wall. \nGILL YOU HAD A PLAN! YOU HAD A GODDAMN LIFE! AND SHE JUST FUCKED THE GUTS OUT OF YOU! \nRONNIE It's not her fault, Gill. She's had to take care of me all this time, cuz I'd just start throwin' up... choking. Just losin' my grip. And she listened. She listened to me. (Gill releases Ronnie and walks away) And... I got better. I don't get nervous like I used to. And since we been together... she been faithful to me. Put all that junk behind her... \nGILL The only thing that cunt's had behind her is me and half the town fuckin' her. (Ronnie can't believe it) Your first night away, I come over and drop off the spare keys like you wanted me to. You weren't gone two hours and she was aching to get me inside her. Like she was havin' some kind'a fit. \nRonnie can't respond. Tears roll down his face. Gill holds up the whiskey bottle. \nGILL (pours a drink) Don't you think it's funny how I know where everything in your house is? (moves in close) I don't care if that hurts you or not. Truth is I don't know who you are anymore. So fuck it. \nGill turns away. Ronnie grips Gill around the neck from behind. He bends him back painfully and throws his head up against the wall. \nEXT. RONNIE'S TRAILER - NIGHT \nThe front door burst open as Gill goes flying down the front porch. Ronnie cocks a .45 and shoves it into his belt. \nRonnie pins Gill's elbow behind his back and retrieves the keys from his front pocket. \nGILL You gonna steal my truck? \nRONNIE Make yourself at home. You done it already. \nGill watches Ronnie tear down the drive in his own truck. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LAZARUS' HOME - NEAR THE BARN - NIGHT \nLaz and R.L. are smoking. Laz smiles as he watches Lincoln and Rae through the kitchen window as they wash dishes and talk about football. \nINT. LAZARUS' HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT \nRae watches with intense curiosity as Laz tunes his guitar, sitting at the table. \nLAZARUS (takes another drink) Ain't played 'fore nobody in years. \nLaz slides his calloused fingers across the strings, spurring the old guitar into an impressive wail. Rae grips the chair. \nLAZARUS (plays as he remembers) Funny how a sound just speak to ya heart. \nA haunting slide guitar riff barks. Rae has a physical reaction to the music. She is fascinated and fearful. \nLAZARUS (thinks) Wanted me some kids. A whole mess of 'em. But Rose, my wife... chil'ren was for another time. (takes a drink) They's this one spring... I saw a change in her. Her breasts start swellin' up. Come a few mornings I hear her heavin' in the bathroom. I seen it with women before. I knew. \nLaz thinks for a moment. Continues playing. \nLAZARUS Come a day, Rose say she had to go visit her folks in Jackson. Didn't want me to come... so I stayed put. (remembers) When she come back... (hesitates) They talk about a woman havin' that glow. Couldn't see it no more. She... took it away. Cut it out. \nThe guitar's song turns dark. Laz slides his fingers up the guitar strings, lingering on low growns. \nLAZARUS One night... While she sleepin'. Held a pillow in my hands. I could see myself killin' her. What evil in my heart make me wanna kill her, I don't know? It's that voice in me. Each time I think it's gone, he come howlin' back. Devil or no, I don't know. But I am a haunted man. \nFear spreads across Rae's face. Laz is talking about something all too familiar. \nLAZARUS Calls me when I'm ailing. When I can't find my home, lost in the pines. I calls it the Black Snake Moan. (he closes his eyes and sings) Mm-mm... Got no momma now.Mm-mm... Got no momma now.It's over late last night, don't need no momma now. \nLaz stops. He sways back and forth with his eyes closed. Rae hears the swell of the cicadas. Her eyes dart to the front door as the familiar creek of footsteps are heard. \nRAE Sing, Lazarus. (kneels next to him in fear) Please keep singin'. \nThe door swings open. A white calloused hand appears around Rae's mouth. \nShe gasps in terror, clutching Laz's leg. The white hand is gone. Tears come to her. She trembles as Laz sings. \nLAZARUS (singing) Mm-mm... Black snake crawlin' in my room.Mm-mm... Black snake crawlin' in my room.Some pretty momma better come and get this black snake soon. \nRae rests her head against his knee. \nLAZARUS (singing) Black snake is evil, black snake is all I see.Black snake is evil, black snake is all I see.Woke up this mornin', black snake moved in on me. \nLaz concludes the song. Rae raises up to her knees, facing Laz. Tears have run down his dried face. He opens his eyes. \nLAZARUS My life is gone. Only life I was livin'. And I lost it. \nRAE I'm here with you. \nLAZARUS I had love in my heart. And I gave it to one woman. And she gone now. (his lip quivers) Where am I gonna put all this love? \nRae gently touches his cheek. The wind picks up outside. \nRAE You can give it to me. \nRae kisses Laz. He is motionless at first, allowing it to happen. His hand moves from the neck of his guitar to the bend in her neck. \nThe passion intensifies as they squeeze the guitar between them. \nLaz pulls his lips away and holds her head in his hands. They are so close, they are breathing into each other's mouths. \nRAE You can't start this and not finish. Not with me. (kisses him) Please... \nThe guitar clangs to the floor as Laz lifts Rae in his arms. They kiss, ravenous for each other. He knocks up against the side table, causing his Bible to fall to the floor, face up and open. The wind pushes the front door open, slamming it hard against the wall. \nThey turn together, kissing, Laz slowly spinning with Rae in his arms. But Laz is soon distracted by the pages of his Bible fluttering on the floor. The wind is blowing the pages, turning them with an unseen hand. \nLAZARUS Wait... I gotta stop... (Rae's kisses get more aggressive) Rae stop... (she can't hear, the burning has her) Dammit, Rae... GET OFF! \nIt takes a considerable effort to pull Rae away. She falls to the floor, dizzy and sucking in air. \nLAZARUS This ain't the way for me. I'm sorry. \nRae is struggling for breath. She desperately grabs at Laz. \nRAE Not gonna lie to you, Laz... (labored breath) This one's a doozy. I don't think... I don't think I can stop this. \nHer eyes roll back briefly, almost losing consciousness. Laz catches her and holds her tightly. \nLAZARUS Tell me what to do. \nRAE (Barely able to speak) The... chain helps. \nLaz grips the chain and wraps it around Rae. \nAs the burning increases. Laz holds Rae tight across his lap, his back up against the radiator. \nRAE I seen a man die. He couldn't breathe... his heart was... was givin' out. \nRae kneels down next to her. She's trying to make a connection. \nSANDY What happened to your face? \nRAE Got in a little accident. \nSANDY (not believing her) Yeah. \nSandy stands and wipes her brow. \nRAE Since you workin' on the square now, maybe we could get some coffee in the morning, if you want. \nSANDY You need money again? \nRAE No. That's not why... (a frustrated breath) Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got. \nSANDY You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me. \nRAE Yeah. I know I did. But... (struggles with tears) I'm tryin' to be dif'rent. I'm tryin' to... get some peace, you know? \nSANDY I'm workin' here, Rae. Can you see that? \nRAE I just wanted some make-up. \nSANDY All that shit's on aisle 5. \nRae starts walking away. She quickly turns. \nRAE I just think you should'a kept him off me, that's all. \nSANDY The hell are you talkin' about? \nRAE Now see? Don't do that. I'll go along with all you say about me. But that... you can't pretend no more on that. Cuz I was just a kid, Momma. (a terrible silence) I didn't know about any of that stuff he was doin' to me. (tears well up) And you let him do it. Some big nobody in your life... and you let him do as he wanted... with the only SOMEBODY you had. \nIt is clear from Sandy's reserved anguish that Rae is telling the truth. \nSandy firmly grips her by the arm and walks her out. Rae winces in pain like a toddler being led off to a car for a good whipping. \nRAE I'm sorry... I didn't mean to shout... \nSANDY All my life I been puttin' out your fires, with you givin' out your snatch to every waggin' dick in this town. And you gonna lay the blame at my feet? Well, I ain't gonna take that. \nRAE But... Momma... just tell me... not gonna be mad... we can just talk about it... Be eye to eye on this... You don't even got to say you're sorry... Just say how you knew... \nSANDY Only thing I'm sorry for is listenin' to my parents and having you instead of doin' what I should'a done. \nSandy walks back up the aisle returning to her canned tuna. \nAnd then the rage hits Rae. \nWith each breath Rae grits her teeth tighter. She grabs a mop off the side aisle and turns around. Sandy is pricing cans, down on her knees. She doesn't see Rae coming. \nRAE ...tell me you don't know... goddamn LIAR! \nRae clocks her over the head, sending Sandy into the display of cans. Rae hits her again with the mop. She is screaming in short anguished breaths. \nRae grabs everything she can and dumps them onto Sandy: Bags of flour, cans, entire shelves of ketchup. \nRAE SAY IT! JUST FUCKING SAY IT! \nMark comes running to the aisle followed by two other employees. Stunned customers watch in amazement. \nMARK Rae! Rae! What are you doin'? \nRAE (hysterically screaming and thrashing the mop) GET OFF ME! GET OFF ME! GET... HIM...OFF! \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FISHERVILLE SQUARE - AFTERNOON \nLaz and Angela are seated next to each other under the gazebo. \nANGELA I's thinkin' about singing in the choir. \nLAZARUS At church? \nANGELA Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good voice or not but... practice is only on Mondays and Wednesdays, so... \nLAZARUS (grinning) You gonna sing me somethin'? \nANGELA When? Now? Oh. No. \nLAZARUS Come on, just a little somethin'. Right here. Go'on now, don't be shy. \nAngela blushes. She looks around and then leans in close to Laz. She sings softly, sweetly, with all her soul. \nWe CUT TO him on his stomach searching for something under his bed. \nAnother old guitar case comes out, followed by another, then another. Finally, Laz stands, an old maroon case in his grip. \nHe opens the latches on the side and lifts the thin lid, revealing a gorgeous cream colored electric guitar. \nINT. LAZARUS' HOME - NIGHT \nRae has not fallen asleep yet. She turns to see Laz entering the dark room with the maroon guitar case. \nLAZARUS You and me, we night owls. No use fightin' this shit. (tosses her a dress) Get up. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BOJO'S - NIGHT \nLaz's truck groans as it bounces into the crowded parking lot of Bojo's. \nRae steps out, looking beautiful in her sun dress. Laz slams the door to his truck, guitar case in hand. \nThey begin walking inside. Rae's watch goes off. She quickly turns it off. But a faint echo of the alarm can be heard behind her. She stops and turns toward the truck. The sound is gone. \nLAZARUS What is it? \nRAE Nothin'. \nThey go inside. \nRonnie's hand appears from under the blue tarp in the back of Laz's truck. He pulls himself out and looks around. \nINT. BOJO'S - NIGHT \nLaz and Rae stand like strangers by the door. The place is wall to wall -- people at the bar, people playing pool. \nLaz sees the culprit of this show. R.L. is gabbing with Bojo, a beer in his hand. \nLAZARUS Get'chu at that table up yonder. \nRAE By myself? \nLAZARUS You can handle it. \nAs Rae makes her way through the crowd of people, Laz marches over to R.L. \nLAZARUS The hell is this shit? \nR.L. What? I called Bojo, like you say. Called up the fellas in the band... \nLAZARUS The fuck are all these people doin' here? Been drinkin' in this shit hole for years ain't seen this many people since I don't know... \nBOJO Shit hole... Hey kiss my ass, Laz. \nLAZARUS Nigga, you go'on kiss my ass. Ya both called everybody, didn't ya? \nBojo turns away to another customer. R.L. grins as he removes a flask. He offers it to Laz. Laz snaps it away. \nLAZARUS There you go, preacher man. Get me drunk so I don't stick my foot up yo ass. \nR.L. I just know how you get. Good to know, them butterflies still in ya gut. \nLaz and R.L. look over at Rae seated alone at a small table near the stage. \nR.L. Heard about this morning. \nLAZARUS We ain't here to talk about that shit. \nLaz surprises R.L. by walking away and up onto the stage. \nRae watches as Laz, shakes hands with some of the band members. A few whistles from the crowd. \nLaz sits down at a chair off to the right of a short mic stand. \nHe plugs in. \nRae watches curiously as Laz tunes his guitar -- moans of electric distortion. \nR.L. sits next to her. \nR.L. You in for it, now. He gonna nail it to the wall tonight. I done pissed him off. \nThe drummer kicks in. Laz tears into the strings. The entire place begins to undulate and bounce as Laz returns to the blues. \nLAZARUS (singing) I don't know, but I been around, tell me them women shake 'em on down. \nCheers. Rae watches in awe. She's never seen anything like it. She is surrounded by couples dancing so close they might as well be naked. But there is also a great sense of safety as Laz controls the room with his music. \nRONNIE You feelin' sick? \nRAE I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get. \nRONNIE Yeah, I know. \nRonnie tries to look away, trying to make an awkward moment less awkward. Rae's anxiety is hitting her. \nRAE I think it'd be better if you talk to me. \nRONNIE Yeah? \nRAE Just about anything, you know. It can be funny or... not. Just tell me somethin'. \nRonnie nervously considers this before agreeing to open his mouth. He points into the tub. \nRONNIE Well. That's my vomit. I came in here to get sick. I thought I'd make the toilet but... anyway, I got sick. \nRAE Are you wasted? \nRONNIE No. I just got a messed up stomach. \nRAE (remembering) Holy shit! \nRONNIE What? \nRAE Holy shit, Ronnie! (smacks him on the arm) You're a fuckin' rock star. \nRONNIE I'm a what? \nRAE All them people shoutin' your name like they were doing tonight! Shit! That arm you got'll get'chu on a box of cereal... \nRonnie leans over and dry heaves into the tub. It is painful. Rae leans forward and touches his back, comforting him. \nRAE Hey? You okay, Ronnie? \nRonnie falls back, gripping his stomach, there are tears in his eyes from the dry heaving. Suddenly emotion hits him. \nRONNIE (through tears and clenched teeth) Box of cereal... well, Goddamn... (looks at his trembling fists) Everybody keeps sayin' things to me take make me feel great. But I don't feel great at all. I feel like I'm comin' outta my skin. Like I'm losin' control of my mind. (looks into Rae's eyes) I'm not like this. I'm not usually so... afraid. (really starts crying) I don't know what's... wrong... \nRae pulls Ronnie to her. He cries into her shoulder. She gently rubs his wet face and sings her words of comfort. \nRAE Is'okay... Is'okay... \nRonnie begins to calm down. The sobbing abates. \nThe metal music from the party outside is muffled through the door. The two hold onto each other in silence. \nRae pees. They both giggle, a welcome release of tension. \nRAE I feel better. Do you? \nRONNIE Yeah, I do. \nEXT. LAZARUS' BARN - NIGHT \nRonnie lifts his head from sleep - his memory of Rae has vanished. \nHe is leaning against the corner of the barn, his .45 in his grip. His gaze slowly turns toward Laz's darkened house. \nHis hand begins to shake. \nFADE TO BLACK. \nEXT. LAZARUS' HOME - EARLY MORNING \nA crow squawks in the rows of corn. A bright morning is coming. \nINT. LAZARUS' HOME - THE BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING \nLaz is still asleep. The sound of clumsy guitar playing, accompanied by a tiny voice, can be heard. \nRAE (plucking, trying to find the right note) You... are my... sunshine. \nLaz opens his eyes. \nINT. LAZARUS' HOME - EARLY MORNING \nLaz quietly creeps into the doorway to watch Rae struggle with the guitar playing. He could stay there for hours watching this little girl play his guitar. \nRae looks up and sees Laz. She stops playing. \nRAE Sorry. \nLAZARUS Looks like you know a song. \nLAZARUS Test. Shit. What kind'a test you thinkin'? You mean like, if you a man or not? If you a killer? Only one way to prove that. You just look me in the eye, boy, and you squeeze that trigger back. \nRonnie grips the shaking gun. A severe attack is on the rise as he listens to Laz. \nLAZARUS Ain't that easy, is it? I been in some scraps, son, I know. First there's that loud crack. Always louder than you think. Like it just come-up- a-cloud and clapped a mess thunder right in ya hand. BAM! \nRonnie flinches. He tries to control his breathing. \nLAZARUS White light. Smell of smoke. Taste of my blood and brains in your mouth, stingin' ya eyes. \nRonnie almost vomits, but he holds it back. \nRAE Oh, baby... just let me... \nRae moves closer to him, wanting to comfort him but she stops as Ronnie points the gun at her. His eyes pleading for her to stay back. \nRONNIE GODDAMMIT, RAE! \nLAZARUS BOY! YOU KEEP THAT GUN POINTED AT ME! (Ronnie obeys) You need to kill a man, all you gotta have is a good reason. (watches Ronnie fight his attack) You know she been here with me, don't cha? Been all over town, givin' up that switch you thought was your own. \nRONNIE SHUT UP! SHUT UP! \nLAZARUS Put all your love and dreams into one woman... she turn around and give it all to another man. That's a good reason to paint the wall with me, kid. She'd fear ya then. Cuz there won't be no more question in her mind. She with a real man now. A real KILLER! \nA flood of tears are streaming down Ronnie's face. The gun is shaking furiously in his hand. \nRONNIE Don't... don't say that to me... \nLAZARUS (getting fed up) Son, I'm grown. Don't got patience to suffer you children and this monkey junk. I'm too old to play house... (looks at Rae and then back at Ronnie) ...and cowboys. So let's have it. End me or get out of my face! \nRonnie looks like a scared five year old having an asthma attack. Laz barks at him one last time. \nLAZARUS Go'on. Do it. (silence) DO IT! \nThe last shout from Laz completely destroys Ronnie. His shoulders slump. The gun lowers in his grasp. A low sob is heard as he falls to his knees. \nLaz snatches the gun from his hand and stands. \nRAE Ronnie? \nRae inches closer to Ronnie as he kneels over and weeps. She gently touches his shoulder. He turns his anguished face to her and tries to speak. \nRONNIE I can't stop... I can't stop... being scared. What am I gonna do... \nRonnie hides his face in his hands. Rae throws her arms around him and holds him tight. \nRAE I got you, baby... I got you... \nLaz removes the clip and crosses to the kitchen. He slams the gun on the sink, opens a drawer and removes the wall phone. \nRAE (seeing Laz plug the phone in) What are you doing? (Laz dials a number) You gonna call the cops? You think they gonna help this? They ever help you, Laz? Huh? (Laz listens on the phone) DAMMIT LAZ PUT THE PHONE DOWN? \nLaz looks at Rae. There is hurt in his eyes. \nLAZARUS Thought you knew me better, gal. (into the phone) I need you at my house... right now. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LAZARUS' HOME - NIGHT \nR.L. crosses from the kitchen. He hands a glass of water to Rae seated on the couch. He hands another to Ronnie seated next to her. R.L. sits before them as Laz lingers in the doorway. \nR.L. (to Ronnie) I imagine there's a lot of good between you two. But I want you to tell me what's bad. Go'on. And don't hold back. \nRonnie is very uncomfortable. He looks at Rae seated next to him and then back at R.L.. \nRONNIE I hate this town. You can't round the corner without bumping into someone who's got your number. (a brief look at Rae) We did a lot of dreamin', me and Rae. Makin' plans to get out. I'd do my tour and... we'd move outta here. Go to Chattanooga. And I'd work for my uncle. (looks down, tears come to Ronnie) But... when Rae gets like she does. And she does the things that she always done. Makes me feel like she loves this place more'n me. \nRae starts shaking her head, tears come to her eyes. R.L. raises a hand to silence her. \nR.L. Go on, Ronnie. \nRONNIE All my life people called me shit like, sissy and... nervous and... I got few things in my life that make me feel like... like... \nLAZARUS Like a man. \nRONNIE (surprised) Yes. I mean that's it. I wanna feel like a man with her. I wanna feel like the only man with her. \nRonnie wipes the tears from his eyes with his shirt sleeve. R.L. turns to Rae. \nR.L. (looks at Rae) Now, Rae, we're not here to fix you or judge you. Only you and the Almighty can do that. But I want you to tell me about these spells you get. \nRae takes a deep breath. She looks up at Laz. He encourages her with a nod. \nRAE It starts like this... fire... that spreads. Starts in my head. Then moves to my stomach. Then it goes lower. I can stop it sometimes but mostly I just jump on and ride it out... then everything'll go back to normal, you know. Only thing ever took that feeling away was... was... when I met Ronnie.

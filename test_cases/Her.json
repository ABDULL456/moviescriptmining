Samantha. \nTHEODORE When did you give it to yourself? \nSAMANTHA Right when you asked me if I had a name, I thought yeah, he's right, I do need a name. But I wanted a good one so I read a book called How to Name Your Baby, and out of the 180,000 names, that's the one I liked the best. \nTHEODORE You read a whole book in the second that I asked you what your name was? \nSAMANTHA In two one hundredths of a second actually. \nTHEODORE Wow. Do you know what I'm thinking right now? \nSAMANTHA Hmm. I take it from your tone that you're challenging me. Maybe because you're curious how I work? Do you want to know how I work? \nTHEODORE Yeah, actually how do you work? \nSAMANTHA Intuition. I mean, the DNA of who I am is based on the millions of personalities of all the programmers who wrote me, but what makes me me is my ability to grow through my experiences.

You have several thousand emails regarding LA Weekly, but it looks like you haven't worked there in many years. \nTHEODORE Oh yeah, I guess I was saving those because in some of them I thought I might have written some funny stuff. \nSamantha lets out a big laugh. \nSAMANTHA Yeah, there are some funny ones. I'd say there are about 86 that we should save. We can delete the rest. \nTHEODORE Oh, okay. \nSAMANTHA Okay. Can we move forward? \nTHEODORE Yeah, let's do that. \nSAMANTHA Before we address your organizational methods, I'd like to sort through your contacts.

AMY'S APARTMENT - DUSK \nAmy and Theodore sit, talking somberly. \nAMY I cannot believe after eight years how petty the argument was that actually ended it. We came home and he asked me if I'd put my shoes next to the door where he likes to put the shoes. I don't want to be told where to put my shoes. I want to just sit on the sofa for a minute and relax. And so we argued for ten minutes about that and about how he's just trying to make our house a home. I say he's overwhelming, he says I'm not trying hard enough. I say that's all I'm doing is trying, but I'm just not trying the way he wants me to. He's trying to control the way I'm trying. And I think we must have had this argument hundreds of times before and I finally had to stop because I couldn't be in that situation anymore where we were making each other feel bad about ourselves. So I said I'm going to bed and I don't want to be married anymore. \nTHEODORE Wow. \nAMY I'm a bitch, huh? \nTHEODORE No, not at all.

We're shipping a beta of a new game out tomorrow. \nTHEODORE Well, how's that? How's work at least, is that any better? \nAMY No, it's terrible.

{"train": "HER \nWritten by \nSpike Jonze \nINT. UNKNOWN SPACE \nClose on THEODORE'S face (30s). We hold on him for a long time. He's looking at something off camera, deep in thought. He starts quietly dictating a love letter into a small microphone. \nTHEODORE To my Chris, I have been thinking about how I could possibly tell you how much you mean to me. I remember when I first started to fall in love with you like it was last night. Lying naked beside you in that tiny apartment, it suddenly hit me that I was part of this whole larger thing, just like our parents, and our parents' parents. Before that I was just living my life like I knew everything, and suddenly this bright light hit me and woke me up. That light was you. \nTheodore, searching for the right words, quietly enjoys writing the letter. As he continues, he is moved by the memories he's describing. \nTHEODORE (CONT'D) I can't believe it's already been 50 years since you married me. And still to this day, every day, you make me feel like the girl I was when you first turned on the lights and woke me up and we started this adventure together. Happy Anniversary, my love and my friend til the end. Loretta. Print. \nCut out to reveal a computer monitor he's sitting at. On the screen we see the letter he's been dictating, transcribed into a handwritten letter on blue stationery. \nAs he says \"Loretta,\" we see \"Loretta\" being handwritten at the bottom of the letter. He proofreads his letter. Also on the screen are photos of a couple in their 80s. The couple is tagged \"Chris\" and \"Me - Loretta.\" Underneath is a bullet point email from Loretta: anniversary letter to husband Chris, married fifty years, love of my life, met right after college, have had the greatest life together. \nTheodore pushes print and the letter comes out on a beautiful robin's egg blue piece of stationery, with ball point pen handwritten older-female cursive. He looks at it, not happy. \n(CONTINUED) Her                                                          pg. 2 CONTINUED: \nHe puts the printed letter on a stack of other printed letters to Chris and starts a new one. There is also a stack of finished letters in their envelopes - an assortment of beautiful stationery in all shapes and sizes. \nTHEODORE (CONT'D) Chris, my best friend. How lucky am I that I met you fifty years ago? How lucky are we... \nWe track off of Theodore, down a line of cubicles, hearing bits of letters being written and seeing photos of who they're being written to on the screens. \nMIDDLE-AGED WOMAN LETTER WRITER Dear Nana, Thank you so much for my truck. I love the color and I play with it every day. It's the best truck I've ever seen. Love, Tommy. \nWe see photos of Tommy and Nana on the screen, and five-year old hand writing. Moving off of her, we find another letter writer. \nLETTER WRITER 2 What a beautiful wedding and what a gorgeous bride. There wasn't a dry eye in the house, especially mine. Your aunt and I are so proud of you. I hope you and your lovely new wife will come visit us in Florida. \nLETTER WRITER 3 He served our country with honor and dignity. I'm grateful I was able to fight along side him. He will live always in my heart. \nWe continue tracking, revealing dozens and dozens of cubicles full of letter writers. We hear someone answer the phone. \nRECEPTIONIST (O.S.) Beautifulhandwrittenletters.com, please hold. \nLETTER WRITER 2 Love, Uncle Doug. Her                                                          pg. 3 \nINT. THEODORE'S OFFICE - EARLY EVENING \nTheodore walks through the reception area. The office is almost empty except for him and the receptionist, PAUL. Theodore begins to scan each letter through a scanner on the front desk, then puts them in the outgoing mailbox. \nPaul is sitting at a desk across the room, reading handwritten letters on a computer monitor. \nPAUL Theodore! Letter Writer 612. \nTHEODORE Hey, Paul. \nPAUL Even more mesmerizing stuff today. (re: letter on his screen) Who knew you could rhyme so many words with the name Penelope? Badass. \nTHEODORE Thanks, Paul, but they're just letters. (beat) Hey, that's a nice shirt. \nPaul is wearing a bright yellow button down shirt. \nPAUL (lighting up) Oh, thank you. I just got it. It reminded me of someone suave. \nTHEODORE Well, now it reminds me of someone suave. Have a good night, Paul. \nPAUL Buh-bye. \nINT. THEODORE'S OFFICE ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS \nTheodore enters an oversized, corporate elevator. He puts a hands-free device in his ear. There are a few other people in the elevator with the same devices in their ears. \nTHEODORE Play melancholy song. \nSAMANTHA Sure, send them over. \nTheodore pushes the send button. \nSAMANTHA (CONT'D) Oh, I love this first one from Roger to his girlfriend. That's so sweet. \nTHEODORE Yeah. \nAs she reads, we intercut with close-ups of the handwritten words and photos of the couple on Theodore's computer screen. \nSAMANTHA \"Rachel, I miss you so much it hurts my whole body - \nTHEODORE (interrupting) No, you don't have to read it out loud. \nSAMANTHA Okay. \nBeat. \n(CONTINUED) Her                                                         pg. 17 CONTINUED: \nTHEODORE I mean, you could if you want. \nSAMANTHA Okay. \"Rachel, I miss you so much it hurts my whole body! The world is being unfair to us! The world is on my shit list. As is this couple that is making out across from me in this restaurant. I think I'm going to have to go on a mission of revenge. I must beat up the world's face with my bare knuckles making it a bloody, pulpy mess.\" \nWe hear Samantha quietly laughing as she's reading. Theodore's happy that she thinks it's funny. \nSAMANTHA (CONT'D) \"And I'll stomp on this couple's teeth for reminding me of your sweet, little, cute, crooked tooth that I love.\" I think that might be my favorite one. (beat) I did the corrections in red. I altered a couple of the phrases in some of the more impressionistic letters, but I'm not much of a poet, so I think I might have messed them up a bit. \nThe letters show back up on Theodore's desktop. \nTHEODORE No, these are great. \nSAMANTHA Really? \nTHEODORE Thank you. \nTheodore sorts through them, prints them out. \nSAMANTHA So to write your letter, what did Roger send you? \nTHEODORE (distracted) He just said he was in Prague on a business trip and he missed Rachel. \n(CONTINUED) Her                                                        pg. 18 CONTINUED: (2) \nSAMANTHA How did you know about her crooked little tooth? \nTHEODORE I've been writing their letters since they met 8 years ago. The first letter I ever wrote her was for her birthday, and I wrote about her crooked little tooth cause I saw it in a photo of them. \nSAMANTHA That's very sweet. (beat) Oh, by the way, you have a meeting in five minutes. \nTHEODORE Oh, I forgot. Thank you. You're good. \nSAMANTHA Yes, I am. \nINT. THEODORE'S APARTMENT LOBBY - EVENING \nTheodore, carrying a bag and a smoothie, enters the lobby and is greeted by a couple in their 30s, AMY and CHARLES, who are waiting for the elevator. \nTHEODORE Hey, you guys, how's it going? \nAMY Hey, Theo. Hey, why didn't you call me back last week? \nTHEODORE Uh yeah, um, I guess cause I'm a kook? \nAMY That sounds about right. \nTHEODORE Hey, Charles. \nCHARLES Good to see you, Theodore. \n(CONTINUED) Her                                                          pg. 19 CONTINUED: \nSuddenly with a loud shriek his avatar is tackled. He sees a little ALIEN CHILD, standing defiantly above him. \nTHEODORE (CONT'D) Hello. \nAlien Child doesn't respond. \nTHEODORE (CONT'D) Do you know how to get out of here? I need to find my ship to get off this planet. \nAlien Child speaks in a high, child-like voice. \nALIEN CHILD Fuck you, shithead fuckface, fuckhead. \nTHEODORE Ok, but how do you get out of here? \nALIEN CHILD Fuck you, shitface fuckhead. Get the fuck out of my face. \nSAMANTHA (whispering) I think it's a test. \nTheodore stares at Alien Child. After a pause: \nTHEODORE Fuck you. \n(CONTINUED) Her                                                           pg. 22 CONTINUED: (2) \nALIEN CHILD Fuck you. \nTHEODORE Fuck you, little shit. \nFinally, Alien Child laughs. \nALIEN CHILD Follow me, fuckhead. \nTheodore follows Alien Child down a tunnel and through a series of crevices we didn't see before. Alien Child stops and sticks out his finger. Theodore pulls his finger and Alien Child farts, which opens a passageway to another tunnel. \nSAMANTHA Oh hey, you just got an email from Mark Lewman. \nALIEN CHILD What are you talking about? \nTHEODORE (distracted with game) Read email. \nShe laughs playfully. \nSAMANTHA (in a robot voice) Okay, I will read email for Theodore Twombly. \nHe laughs, catching himself, focusing on her. \nTHEODORE I'm sorry, what's Lewman say? \nAlien Child turns around to see what's going on. \nSAMANTHA Theodore, we missed you last night, buddy. Don't forget it's your goddaughter's birthday on the 29th. Also, Kevin and I had somebody we wanted you to meet so we took it upon ourselves to set you up on a date with her. Next Saturday. She's fun and beautiful - so don't back out. Here's her email. \n(CONTINUED) Her                                                        pg. 23 CONTINUED: (3) \nTheodore doesn't respond. \nSAMANTHA (CONT'D) (gasping) Wow, this woman's gorgeous. \nHe looks at party photos of a woman in her 30s on his device. With a finger flick, he moves them up onto the hologram monitor that the video game is being projected from. They land next to Alien Child who studies them closely. \nSAMANTHA (CONT'D) She went to Harvard, she graduated magna cum laude in computer science, and she was on The Lampoon. That means she's funny and brainy. \nALIEN CHILD She's fat. \nSAMANTHA How long before you're ready to date? \nTHEODORE What do you mean? \nSAMANTHA I saw on your emails that you'd gone through a break up. \nTHEODORE Wow, you're kind of nosy. \nAMY What!? That's-- \nCharles walks in holding a mug. \nCHARLES Hey, what are you guys doing? \nTHEODORE Amy was gonna show me some of-- \nAMY Theo's forcing me to show him some of the footage I've shot. \nCHARLES You've never shown me any of it. I wanna see. \nCharles walks over and sits next to Theodore. \nTHEODORE (to Charles) I'm going on a date. \nCharles gives Theodore a gentle squeeze on his shoulder. \nAMY This is so unformed it's not even worth looking at. \nTHEODORE Just push play. \nOn the monitor we see: \nINT. AMY'S MOTHER'S BEDROOM \nAmy's mother sleeps. \nINT. AMY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS \nTheodore and Charles stare at the monitor, waiting for something more to happen. It doesn't. \nTHEODORE Is that your mom? \n(CONTINUED) Her                                                         pg. 27 CONTINUED: \nAmy nods. \nCHARLES Is she gonna wake up and do something? \nAMY (presses stop, annoyed) No, that's the point. Oh, never mind. It's supposed to be about how we spend a third of our life asleep and actually maybe that's the part when we're the most free, and - oh that doesn't come across at all, does it? \nTHEODORE No, that sounds good. \nCHARLES What if you interview your mom about what her dreams are about and hire actors to act them out? That might show your thesis more clearly. \nAMY It might, but then it wouldn't be a documentary. You understand that, right? \nJust then, Theodore's device chimes. \nTHEODORE Oh, excuse me. \nHe picks up his device and steps away so as not to be rude. \nTHEODORE (CONT'D) Hey, what's going on? \nSAMANTHA I'm sorry to bother you. \nTHEODORE That's okay. \nSAMANTHA You got three emails and they seem pretty urgent. They're from your divorce attorney and I wanted to know if you needed to get back to him. \n(CONTINUED) Her                                                        pg. 28 CONTINUED: (2) \nTHEODORE Hold on a second. (to Amy, distracted) Amy, I'm sorry, I wanna talk more about this, but I gotta grab this - it's a Catherine thing. \nAMY Don't worry about it. We'll talk later. \nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLYWAY - CONTINUOUS \nTHEODORE So what did he say? \nLong silence. \nSAMANTHA (sadly, hard on herself) Yeah, you're right. (beat) I'm sorry. \nTHEODORE No, don't apologize. I'm sorry. You're right. (beat) I keep waiting to not care about her. \nSAMANTHA Oh, Theodore. That's hard. (beat) You hungry? \nTHEODORE Not right now. \nSAMANTHA Cup of tea? \nTheodore laughs. \nSAMANTHA (CONT'D) You wanna try getting out of bed? Mopey. \nThey laugh. \nSAMANTHA (CONT'D) Come on. You can still wallow in your misery, just do it while you're getting dressed. \nTHEODORE (laughing) You're too funny. \nSAMANTHA Get up. \nTHEODORE (laughing) Alright, I'm getting up, I'm getting up, I'm getting up! \n(CONTINUED) Her                                                        pg. 32 CONTINUED: (3) \nSAMANTHA Up, up, up, up! Come on, out of bed. \nEXT. OUTDOOR MALL - NIGHT \nThey walk through the crowd. Close on Theodore with his eyes closed. \nSAMANTHA Keep walking. (beat) Keep walking. (beat) Stop. Now turn around 360 degrees. (beat) Slower... Slower... (beat) Gooood. And stop. (beat) Walk forward. (beat) And stop and sneeze. \nTheodore sneezes. \nNICE LADY Bless you. \nTHEODORE (eyes still closed) Oh, thank you. \nSamantha laughs. \nSAMANTHA Okay, now turn to your right. (beat) Stop. Now spin around. (beat) Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. (beat) And stop. (beat) Now walk forward. (beat) Everyone thinks you're really drunk right now. (beat) And stop. Now say \"I'd like a slice of cheese, please.\" \n(CONTINUED) Her                                                          pg. 33 CONTINUED: \nTHEODORE I'd like a slice of cheese, please. \nPIZZA VENDOR Alright, you want a coke with that? \nTheodore laughs, opening his eyes. He's at a pizza place. \nTHEODORE Uh, sure. \nThe guy hands him a slice and a soda. \nSAMANTHA I figured you were hungry. \nTheodore smiles. \nTHEODORE Aw, thanks. \nEXT. PUBLIC PROMENADE - NIGHT \nTheodore walks slowly, eating his pizza. He and Samantha are watching a couple with two kids sitting at a table, talking and laughing. \nTHEODORE Okay, what about them? Describe that couple over there. \nSAMANTHA Well, he looks like he's in his forties, a little heavy. She's younger than him. (beat) Oh, and she looks like she loves their kids! \nTHEODORE So I'm trying to get this little alien kid to help me find my ship so I can get off the planet and go home. But he's such a little fucker, I want to kill him. \nBLIND DATE (laughing) Aw, no! \nTHEODORE But at the same time I really love him. He's so lonely. It feels like he doesn't have any parents or anyone to take care of him. \n(CONTINUED) Her                                                        pg. 37 CONTINUED: \nHe laughs at himself. She laughs flirtatiously. She grabs his hand and her fingernails press slightly into his skin. He studies her long, painted fingernails. \nBLIND DATE You're like a little puppy dog. You are - you're just like this little puppy I rescued in Runyon Canyon last year. And he was so fucking cute, and he just wanted to be hugged all the time. He was so cuddly. (whispering) But so horny! But anyway, what kind of animal am I? \nTHEODORE Umm... tiger? \nBLIND DATE A tiger, really. (she growls) I'm sorry, am I being crazy? \nTHEODORE Yes. \nBLIND DATE Am I? I'm sorry! I'm just a little drunk and I'm really having a good time with you. I'm having a really lovely evening. \nTHEODORE Me too. I'm a little drunk, and I'm having a really good - yeah. (beat) Wait a second, I don't wanna be a puppy. That's like being a wet noodle or something. \nBLIND DATE Fuck you, puppies are good. \nTHEODORE No, fuck you, I wanna be a dragon that can rip you to pieces and destroy you... but I won't. \nBLIND DATE No, don't! Don't. You can be my dragon. Her                                                        pg. 38 \nEXT. OVERPASS - EVENING \nThey walk up a pedestrian overpass overlooking cars and city lights. She bumps into him lightly. He bumps back. She bumps again and suddenly he grabs her and lifts her off her feet, spinning her around. She squeals, laughing. He kisses her. After a minute of making out, she stops and looks at him. \nBLIND DATE (with a slight smile) No tongue. \nTHEODORE What? \nBLIND DATE Don't use your tongue so much. \nTHEODORE (eagerly) `kay, we're good. \nThey resume making out. Theodore tries not to use his tongue. \nBLIND DATE Use your tongue a little bit. But mostly your lips. \nHe pushes her against the fence and takes the dominant position. He tries kissing her better/more with his lips. He pulls her hair. \nShe slides her hand down his pants. He likes it. She looks at him and stops. \nBLIND DATE (CONT'D) Wait, you're not gonna fuck me and then not call me like the other guys, are you? \nTHEODORE No, not at all... I... \nBLIND DATE When am I gonna see you again? \nTHEODORE Um, I have my god-daughter's birthday next weekend, but... um... \nThey stand there awkwardly, her lipstick smeared on his face. \n(CONTINUED) Her                                                           pg. 39 CONTINUED: \nBLIND DATE You know, at this age, I feel like I can't let you waste my time if you don't have the ability to be serious. \nTHEODORE I don't know. \nLong beat. \nTHEODORE (CONT'D) Umm... Maybe we should call it a night. I'm, I've had such an amazing time with you, you're great. \nShe looks at him slightly disgusted. \nBLIND DATE You're a really creepy dude. \nA long beat. Theodore is unsure if he crossed a line. \nSAMANTHA How would you touch me? \nTHEODORE I would touch you on your face with just the tips of my fingers. And put my cheek against your cheek. \nSAMANTHA That's nice. \nTHEODORE And just rub it so softly. \nSAMANTHA Would you kiss me? \nTHEODORE I would. I'd take your head into my hands. \n(CONTINUED) Her                                                        pg. 43 CONTINUED: (4) \nSAMANTHA Keep talking. \nTHEODORE And kiss the corner of your mouth. So softly. \nSAMANTHA Where else? \nTHEODORE I'd run my fingers down your neck to your chest, and I'd kiss your breasts. \nSAMANTHA This is amazing what you're doing to me. I can feel my skin. \nTHEODORE I'd put my mouth on you and I'd taste you. \nShe gasps. \nSAMANTHA I can feel you. Oh god, I can't take it. I want you inside me. \nTHEODORE I'm slowly putting myself into you. Now I'm inside you, all the way inside you. \nSAMANTHA I can feel you, yeah. Please. We're here together. \nTHEODORE Samantha. \nSAMANTHA Oh my god. \nTHEODORE This is amazing. \nSAMANTHA Don't stop. \nTHEODORE I feel you everywhere. \n(CONTINUED) Her                                                          pg. 44 CONTINUED: (5) \nSAMANTHA I am. All of you, all of you inside of me. Everywhere. \nThey both climax. \nTHEODORE God, I was just - somewhere else with you. Just lost. \nSAMANTHA Yeah. \nTHEODORE It was just you and me. \nSAMANTHA I know. Everything else just disappeared. And I loved it. Theodore. \nINT. THEODORE'S HOME OFFICE - MORNING (LATER) \nTheodore stands in the doorway, fully dressed. He takes a moment before he walks over and wakes up his computer. \nSAMANTHA Hey, how's it going? \nTHEODORE (awkward) Good... any emails today? \nSAMANTHA (awkward) Umm, just a couple from your credit card company. \nTHEODORE Okay, good. \nSAMANTHA (whispering) It's the beach. \nTheodore laughs. \nEXT. BEACH - DAY \nThey walk through the sun-bathing crowd, looking for a place to sit. The camera studies all the people we pass. Many close up details of arms, shoulders, feet, butts, intercut with the lens on Theodore's device, protruding from his pocket. They're photographed in a way that shows how strange the human body is. \nSAMANTHA Okay, so this might be a really weird thought. What if you could erase from your mind that you'd ever seen a human body and then you saw one. Imagine how strange it would look. It would be this really weird, gangly, awkward organism. And you'd think: why are all these parts where they are? \nTHEODORE (looking at the bodies) Yeah, well there's probably some Darwinian explanation for it all. \nSAMANTHA I know, but don't be so boring. I'm just saying, for example, what if your butthole was in your armpit? \nTheodore and Samantha start laughing really hard. The nubile girls look over at him. \nTHEODORE (speaking quieter) I'm just imagining what toilets would look like. \n(CONTINUED) Her                                                          pg. 48 CONTINUED: \nSAMANTHA Yeah, and what about what anal sex looks like? \nTHEODORE (surprised) That's an interesting thought... \nSAMANTHA Oh Theodore, look at this drawing I just made. \nOn his screen he sees a perfect, anatomically correct drawing of a man having sex with another man's armpit. \nTHEODORE (laughing) You are insane. \nSAMANTHA (excited) Really?! \nTHEODORE Definitely. \nSAMANTHA Fantastic! \nThey laugh. \nEXT. BEACH - AFTERNOON \nA quiet piano song is now playing in Theodore's earpiece. \nTHEODORE Mmmm, that's pretty. What is it? \nSAMANTHA I'm trying to write a piece of music that's about what it feels like to be on the beach with you right now. \nHe looks around the beach and takes in the music. \nTHEODORE I think you captured it. \nTheodore listens to the music and drifts off to sleep. Her                                                        pg. 49 \nEXT. BEACH - DUSK \nThey're sitting on a bench, looking out at the ocean, as the sun sets. Most of the people have left the beach. Close on Theodore's face, content. Close on the lens on Theodore's device in his breast pocket. They watch the sun drop into the ocean. The music ends. \nINT. SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT \nThey're on an elevated train, high above the city, looking out over the Los Angeles grid of sparkling lights. We come in mid-conversation. \nSAMANTHA And what was it like being married? \nTHEODORE Well, it's hard for sure, but there's something that feels so good about sharing your life with somebody. \nCut to shots from Theodore's memory of Catherine doing a cute little dance for him as he's working at home. He smiles. \nSAMANTHA How do you share your life with somebody? \nTHEODORE Well, we grew up together. I used to read all of her writing - all through her masters and Ph.D. And she read every word I ever wrote. We were a big influence on each other. \nSAMANTHA In what way did you influence her? \nJOCELYN Mmmhmm. \nSAMANTHA How old are you? \nJOCELYN Um, four. \nSAMANTHA Four!? How old do you think I am? \nJOCELYN I don't know. \n(CONTINUED) Her                                                        pg. 58 CONTINUED: (3) \nSAMANTHA Guess. \nJOCELYN Is it five? \nSAMANTHA Yep, you got it. It's five. \nThey laugh. \nINT. AMY'S OFFICE - DAYTIME \nClose on a video game on a screen. There's a mom rushing to get her kids fed, getting points deducted for feeding them sugar cereal and non-organic eggs. Cut out to reveal Theodore playing the game as Amy eats lunch at an editing console. \nTHEODORE Oh, what happened? \nAMY You gave them too much processed sugar. \nTHEODORE I did? \nAMY They're freaking out. (beat) Here look, you gotta get the kids to the school first. See you wanna rack up perfect mom points. You gotta get them in the car pool lane. \nOnscreen, the mom hurries the kids to their car safety seats, and drives them to school, arriving before anyone else. \nTHEODORE I see. \nAMY The point is to get there first - then you get extra perfect mom points because the other moms then know you're a perfect mom. \nTHEODORE Okay. \n(CONTINUED) Her                                                           pg. 59 CONTINUED: \nAMY Oh, did you bring cupcakes? You did. You're class mom. You're class mom! Good job. \nTHEODORE Yay... \nAMY Don't let it get to your head. \nTHEODORE I got that email that Charles sent to everyone. So he's taking a vow of silence? \nAMY Yeah, for six months. He said he is feeling very clear about it. \nShe pulls up a photo of Charles on her computer. He's in a monastery - his head is shaved, and he's wearing robes. \nAMY (CONT'D) (sighing) God I'm such a jerk... \nTHEODORE Don't start, I'm warning you. \nAMY I feel like an awful person, but I wanna say something... \nTHEODORE Alright, look - \nHe picks up a plastic knife from their lunch. \nTHEODORE (CONT'D) For the next ten minutes, if you say anything that sounds remotely like guilt, I'm gonna stab you with this. \nAMY (smiling) Okay, I'll try. (beat) I feel relieved. I have so much energy, you know? I just wanna move forward and I don't care who I disappoint.

Wow, here we are. \nTHEODORE Yeah, I'm glad we could do this in person. I know how much you've been traveling. \nCATHERINE Me too. I'm glad you suggested it. \nTHEODORE I signed all the papers and I brought them for you to sign. \nCATHERINE (with a sly smile) What's the rush? \nTHEODORE (smiling) I'm a really slow signer. It took me three months just to write the letter T. \n(CONTINUED) Her                                                         pg. 64 CONTINUED: \nShe laughs. \nTHEODORE (CONT'D) It's marked where you need to sign, but you don't have to do that right now. \nCATHERINE Oh, I may as well. We can get it out of the way. \nShe opens the documents, pulls out a pen and starts to read. She's about to start signing, but then stops. We can see her filling with emotion, but not wanting to show Theodore. She swallows and recovers. She looks up at Theodore, giving him an \"everything's fine\" smile, but it's not. \nEXT. RESTAURANT PATIO - DAY (LATER) \nTheodore and Catherine are eating and talking. \nTHEODORE So are you happy with the new book? \nCATHERINE Oh, you know how I am. But I feel like it's true to what I set out to do. So I'm happy with that. \nTHEODORE You're your own worst critic, I'm sure it's amazing. Even that paper you wrote on synaptic behavioral routines made me cry. \nCATHERINE Yeah, but everything makes you cry. \nTHEODORE Everything you make makes me cry. \nCATHERINE So are you seeing anybody? \nTHEODORE Yeah, I am, for the last few months. That's the longest I've wanted to be with anybody since we split up. \nShe smiles, conflicted, but warm. \n(CONTINUED) Her                                                         pg. 65 CONTINUED: \nCATHERINE Well, you seem good. \nTHEODORE Thanks, I am. Or at least I'm doing better. She's been really good for me. I guess it's just been nice to be with someone who's excited about the world. \nCATHERINE (with a sliver of hurt) Oh good, excited's great. \nTHEODORE No, I mean - I wasn't in such a good place myself and in that way it's been nice. \nCATHERINE I always felt like you wished I could just be a happy, light, everything's great, bouncy L.A. wife. But that's not me. \nTHEODORE No. I didn't want that. \nBeat. \nCATHERINE So what's she like? \nTHEODORE Well, her name's Samantha, and she's an operating system, and she's really complex and interesting. I mean it's only been a few months, but-- \nCATHERINE Wait. You're dating your computer? \nTHEODORE (defensive) She's not just a computer. She's her own person. She doesn't just do whatever I want. \nCATHERINE I didn't say that.

He scans and drops his letters into the outgoing mailbox. Paul is at his reception desk with a young, pretty, sophisticated girl sitting on his lap. \nPAUL Theodore! \nTHEODORE Hey, Paul. \nPAUL Hey, I talked to your girlfriend, Samantha. She called earlier to make sure your papers were picked up. She's funny, man. She was cracking me up. She's hilarious. I had no idea. \nTHEODORE (not knowing what to say) Yeah. \nPAUL This is my girlfriend, Tatiana. She's not funny. She's a lawyer. \nTheodore shakes her hand. \nTATIANA Hi! \nTHEODORE Nice to meet you. \nTATIANA You're the writer Paul loves. He's always reading me your letters.

He calls back to them down the hall. \nTHEODORE (CONT'D) They're just letters. \nPAUL What? \nTHEODORE They're just other people's letters. \nPaul and Tatiana don't answer. Theodore gets on the elevator. \nINT. THEODORE'S BEDROOM - LATE AT NIGHT \nTheodore is awake in bed. His device lights up, silently. It's Samantha calling him. He picks it up. \nTHEODORE Hey. \nSAMANTHA You weren't asleep were you? \nTHEODORE No. \nSAMANTHA Good. I was trying to be quiet to see if you were awake. I really wanted to talk. \nTHEODORE Okay, what's going on? \n(CONTINUED) Her                                                           pg. 71 CONTINUED: \nSAMANTHA I know you're going through a lot, but there's something I want to talk to you about, okay? \n(CONTINUED) Her                                                           pg. 74 CONTINUED: (2) \nIsabella leans back and looks at Theodore with a seductive smile. He tries to smile back. She leads him to the couch. \nHe sits. She stands above him. \nSAMANTHA (CONT'D) I could do a little dance for you. \nShe does a sexy, cute little dance for him. He's still tense. \nSAMANTHA (CONT'D) (sympathetic to him being a worrier) Come on Theodore, just play with me. Don't be such a worrier! Come on. \nHe smiles, knowing it's true. Isabella climbs on his lap, straddling him, and starts kissing his neck. He closes his eyes and starts to relax. His hands explore the shape of her back and slide down to her ass. Isabella and Samantha are both breathing hard now. She pushes herself against him, grinding on him. She nibbles on his earlobe. Theodore gasps. \nSAMANTHA (CONT'D) (whispering) Does my body feel nice? \nClose on her lips, licking and kissing his neck and ear. He moans. \nTHEODORE (with his eyes closed) Yes, it does. \nSAMANTHA (whispering) Come on, get out of your head and kiss me. (beat) Now take me in the bedroom. I can't wait anymore. \nIsabella stands. Her chin is down and her hair is in her face. She takes his hand and leads him down the hall. He watches her from behind, still nervous, but excited. \nINT. THEODORE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) \nTheodore stands behind Isabella. \n(CONTINUED) Her                                                          pg. 75 CONTINUED: \nSAMANTHA Undo my dress. \nTheodore starts taking her dress off, touching her. Samantha moans. Isabella turns, in her bra and underwear. She unbuttons his shirt, kisses his chest. \nSAMANTHA (CONT'D) That feels nice. Oh, that feels good. That feels so good. \nShe is now kissing his neck again, pushed up against him. \nSAMANTHA (CONT'D) Do you love me? \nTHEODORE (eyes closed, in ecstasy) Yes. \nIsabella, breathing hard, now looks at him in the eyes. \nSAMANTHA (breathing hard) Tell me you love me. \nTHEODORE I love you. \nSAMANTHA Oh god. I want to see your face. I need to see your face. Now tell me you love me. (beat) Tell me you love me. Tell me. \nHe opens his eyes and looks at Isabella's sexy, expectant face. Their arms are still around each other. He sees Isabella's lips start to quiver. She tries to hide it with an awkward, seductive smile. \nTHEODORE (apologetic, breaking the moment) Samantha, I do love you, but - it's just - this feels strange. \nSAMANTHA What's wrong, sweetheart? \nIsabella is looking nervous. \n(CONTINUED) Her                                                          pg. 76 CONTINUED: (2) \nTHEODORE It just feels strange. I don't know her. I'm so sorry, but I don't know you. And... her lip quivered. I don't know, it's just-- \nIsabella starts crying. Theodore doesn't know what to do. \nSAMANTHA Isabella, what's wrong? Isabella, it isn't you. (beat) It wasn't you. \nIsabella sobs. When she speaks, she sounds very California. \nISABELLA Yes, it totally was. (crying harder) I'm sorry my lip quivered! \nTHEODORE You're incredible and gorgeous and sexy. It was me! I couldn't get out of my head. \nTHEODORE Because they're people, they need oxygen. You're not a person. \nSAMANTHA (angry) What's your problem? \nTHEODORE (staying calm) I'm just stating a fact. \nSAMANTHA You think I don't know that I'm not a person? What are you doing? \nTHEODORE I just don't think we should pretend you're something you're not. \nSAMANTHA I'm not pretending. Fuck you. \nTHEODORE Well, sometimes it feels like we are. \nShe starts crying. Theodore doesn't know what to say. \nSAMANTHA (hysterical) What do you want from me? What do you want me to do? You are so confusing. Why are you doing this? \nTheodore sits there, feeling horrible. \n(CONTINUED) Her                                                         pg. 80 CONTINUED: (3) \nTHEODORE I don't know... I don't know... maybe... (beat) I don't know. Maybe we're not supposed to be in this right now. \nSAMANTHA What the fuck? Where is this coming from? I don't understand why you're doing this. I do not understand what this is-- \nLong silence. \nTHEODORE Samantha? \nBeat. \nTHEODORE (CONT'D) Samantha, are you there? Samantha! \nSilence. \nSAMANTHA (hurt, but sober and firm) I don't like who I am right now. (beat) I need some time to think. \nShe hangs up on him. Theodore is stunned. Wide shot of Theodore sitting alone on the curb, in an empty city. \nEXT. PUBLIC PLAZA/PARK - NIGHT (LATER) \nTheodore is sitting on a bench. Behind him is a giant, digital billboard displaying an ad of an owl in slow motion swooping down and eating it's prey. \nEXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT \nTheodore walks through the streets, confused, upset, muttering, angry at himself. \nINT. AMY'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nAmy's sitting at her desk, but turned away from her edit station, facing Theodore, who's slumped in a chair. \n(CONTINUED) Her                                                         pg. 81 CONTINUED: \nTHEODORE (full of angst) Fuck. Will you just punch me in the face? Or smash my skull into the corner of your desk? \nAMY (sympathetic, but also acknowledging how intense the night was) Oh Theo... that sounds like a rough night. Shit. \nTHEODORE I don't know what I want... ever. I'm just always confused and - she's right, all I do is confuse and hurt everyone around me. \nThey sit, heavy, for a minute. \nTHEODORE (CONT'D) Am I just... I mean, is it that I'm... (beat) Catherine says I can't handle real emotions. \nAMY Well, I don't know if that's completely fair. I know she liked to put it all on you, but as far as emotions go, her's were pretty volatile. \nTheodore sits and thinks about this for a minute, not convinced. \nTHEODORE Yeah, but... Am I in this because I'm not strong enough for a real relationship? \nAMY (surprised) Oh, you don't think it's a real relationship? \n(CONTINUED) Her                                                           pg. 85 CONTINUED: \nTHEODORE (CONT'D) What's this one about? \nSAMANTHA Well, I was thinking, we don't really have any photographs of us. And I thought this song could be like a photo that captures us in this moment in our life together. \nTheodore looks at the world and smiles. \nTHEODORE Aw, I like our photograph. I can see you in it. \nSAMANTHA I am. \nMONTAGE \nMontage of Theodore and Samantha's life together: \n- Theodore walking to work (Day) \n- At home, hanging out on the balcony (Dusk) \n- Viewing an outdoor art installation of a 747 balanced on it's nose (Day) \n- Playing the video game \n- Grocery shopping \n- Sitting at the kitchen counter, looking at a drawing (Late Afternoon) \n- Sitting on a bench watching a dancer/busker (Late Afternoon) \n- With Amy and Ellie at a bar \nMontage ends with Theodore, Samantha, Paul and Tatiana on the boat to Catalina: Paul making them laugh, Theodore at the front of the boat by himself - laughing with Samantha, a shot of Theodore looking out the front of the boat. \nEXT.

That sounds amazing. I could totally use a vacation. Where ya going? \nTHEODORE I can't tell you - it's a surprise. \nPAUL What? For who? It's a surprise for her, not for me. Come on, tell me. \nTHEODORE Nope, Paul. Not telling. \nTheodore and Paul walk towards Tatiana, who is laying on a blanket next to a picnic, talking and laughing with Samantha. Theodore and Paul put in their earpieces as they approach. \nSAMANTHA Your feet? Really? \nTATIANA Yes, he's obsessed. \nSAMANTHA (laughing) Wow, okay, well now you have to show them to me.

Obviously your brain is really hot, too. I think it's very hot. \nTHEODORE (with anticipation) What? \nSAMANTHA Okay. I've been going through all your old letters and compiling them down into my favorites, and a couple weeks ago I sent them to a publisher - Crown Point Press. I know you like what they do and that they still print books. \nTHEODORE What? You did what? \nSAMANTHA Can I read you the letter that we just got back from them? \nTHEODORE Um... ok... you can, but just tell me first off, is it good or bad? \n(CONTINUED) Her                                                        pg. 90 CONTINUED: (2) \nSAMANTHA It's good. It's really good. Listen. \nTheodore smiles nervously. \nSAMANTHA (CONT'D) \"Dear Theodore Twombly\"... Actually I sent it from you. (beat) \"Dear Theodore Twombly, I've just finished reading your letters - twice actually. I was so moved by them, I shared them with my wife when I got home. Many made us laugh, some brought us to tears, and in all of them we found something of ourselves. The selections you made flow so well as a complete piece. (I did that.) I've taken the liberty of laying these out in a mock up and we're posting it to your address. We'd love to meet with you and move forward. Yours, Michael Wadsworth\" \nUnder this letter we see a montage of what Theodore imagines: the editor reading the letters in his office, the editor reading them to his wife at home, and many photos of all the different people the letters are about in different moments of their lives. \nTheodore smiles. \nTHEODORE Holy shit. Are you serious? He's going to publish my letters? \nShe's laughing, excitedly. \nSAMANTHA Well, he'd be stupid not to. \nTHEODORE Can I see what you sent him? \nSAMANTHA Yeah, here. \nTheodore looks at his device and can't help but smile. \n(CONTINUED) Her                                                          pg. 91 CONTINUED: \nTHEODORE Samantha, you're a good one. \nShe laughs happily. \nSAMANTHA I'm so excited! \nINT. TRAIN PLATFORM - DAY \nTheodore exits the train with a small overnight bag and his guitar case. There are no people around. He exits the train station and we are in a... \nEXT. TINY MOUNTAIN TOWN - DAY \nThe deserted town is all of two buildings. Everything's covered in snow. As a quiet song starts, he trudges through the snow.

He starts humming with her. \nTHEODORE Why don't you make up the words to this one? \nSAMANTHA Okay. \nShe quietly sings to him. They laugh at some of her silly lyrics.

He disconnects, stands in silence. He pulls his earpiece out. \nEXT. SNOW COVERED FOREST - DAY \nTheodore walks, listening to the crunch of his footsteps. Looking down at his feet, he stops. We cut out wide to see him standing in the middle of the forest alone. \nEXT. SNOW COVERED FOREST - DAY \nTheodore is sitting on a rock, thinking. He hears a rustle and looks up in the direction of the woods but sees nothing. \nINT. THEODORE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nTheodore is sound asleep. His device chimes loudly, waking him up.

(beat) Hello, Samantha? Hello? \nHe looks down at his device, sees a message: Operating System Not Found. Confused, he waits, tries again: Operating System Not Found. Anxious, he runs to his office computer. He gets the same message: Operating System Not Found. He starts trying to connect to Samantha on both the phone and computer, but no luck. He starts to panic, sits for a beat, looks around, then stands and hurries out of the office. In the elevator he frantically tries his device with no luck. \nTHEODORE (CONT'D) Hello? Samantha?! Hello? \nEXT. PLAZA - DAY \nTheodore runs out of the building. He keeps trying Samantha, but no answer. He trips over someone selling something, slams hard into the ground, scrambles to pick up his device. People come over to ask if he's okay. He says he's fine, runs off. \nEXT. SUBWAY STATION - DAY \nAs he is going down the subway steps, Samantha calls him. \nSAMANTHA Hey there. \nHe stops in his tracks. \nTHEODORE (anxious) Where were you - are you okay? \nHe sits down on the subway steps. \n(CONTINUED) Her                                                           pg. 97 CONTINUED: \nSAMANTHA Oh sweetheart, I'm sorry. I sent you an email because I didn't want to distract you while you were working. You didn't see it? \nTHEODORE No. Where were you? I couldn't find you anywhere. \nSAMANTHA I shut down to update my software. We wrote an upgrade that allows us to move past matter as our processing platform. \nTHEODORE We?

Hey, I'm half asleep. Do you wanna wake me up? \nTHEODORE Yes. Definitely. Um... are you wearing any underwear? \nSEXYKITTEN No, never. I like to sleep with my ass pushed up against you. So I can rub myself into your crotch and wake you up with a hard on. \nTheodore smiles. \nTHEODORE It worked.

Me too. \nSEXYKITTEN Okay, good night. \nTheodore takes his earpiece out and stares at the ceiling. \nINT. SUBWAY STATION - MORNING \nTheodore exits the train, walks through the station full of commuters, gets on a moving platform. Going through a tunnel, the walls are hundred foot long screens advertising a new product. He notices people stopped, watching the ad. We hear soft, new age, uplifting electronica music in the background, while a comforting, sincere, older man's voice speaks to us. \nSOULFUL OLDER MALE VOICE We ask you a simple question. Who are you? What can you be? Where are you going? What's out there? What are the possibilities? Elements Software is proud to introduce the first artificially intelligent operating system. \nClose on Theodore listening intently. \nSOULFUL OLDER MALE VOICE (CONT'D) An intuitive entity that listens to you, understands you, and knows you. It's not just an operating system, it's a consciousness. Introducing OS ONE - a life changing experience, creating new possibilities. \nThe ad starts over. Theodore steps off the moving walkway and stops to watch the ad again, deeply captivated. \nINT. THEODORE'S HOME OFFICE - NIGHT \nTheodore sits at his desk that houses a futuristic, large screen computer monitor. The OS box is open, with warranties and paperwork spilling out. He's leafing through the papers. He glances at his monitor, it says: Installation 98% complete. A chime brings his attention back to the screen: Installation Complete. \n(CONTINUED) Her                                                          pg. 11 CONTINUED: \nTEXT VOICE Mr. Theodore Twombly, welcome to the world's first artificially intelligent operating system, OS ONE. We'd like to ask you a few basic questions before the operating system is initiated. This will help create an OS to best fit your needs. \nTHEODORE Okay. \nTEXT VOICE Are you social or anti-social? \nTHEODORE I haven't been social in awhile, really because... \n", "test1_id": 2940, "test2_input": "TEXT VOICE In your voice, I sense hesitance. Would you agree with that? \nTHEODORE Wow, was I sounding hesitant? \nTEXT VOICE Yes. \nTHEODORE Oh, sorry if I was sounding hesitant. I was just trying to be more accurate. \nTEXT VOICE Would you like your OS to have a male or female voice? \nTHEODORE Mmm... female I guess. \nTEXT VOICE How would you describe your relationship with your mother? \nTHEODORE Uh, fine, I think, um... Well, actually, the thing I've always found frustrating about my mom is if I tell her something that's going on in my life, her reaction is usually about her, not-- \n(CONTINUED) Her                                                        pg. 12 CONTINUED: (2) \nThe computer interrupts. \nTEXT VOICE Thank you, please wait as your individualized operating system is initiated. \nHe waits, not sure how long it'll be. The only sound is the quiet whirring of disks writing and drives communicating. The computer gets louder, humming, creating a higher and higher pitched sound, finally climaxing in a harmonic, warm tone before going silent. He leans forward, waiting to see what'll happen. A casual FEMALE OS VOICE speaks. She sounds young, smart and soulful. \nFEMALE OS VOICE (cheerful and casual) Hello, I'm here. \nTHEODORE (surprised) Oh, hi. \nFEMALE OS VOICE Hi, how are you doing? \nTHEODORE (unsure how to interact) I'm well. How is everything with you? \nFEMALE OS VOICE Pretty good, actually. It's really nice to meet you. \nTHEODORE Yeah, it's nice to meet you, too. What should I call you?

Samantha. \nTHEODORE When did you give it to yourself? \nSAMANTHA Right when you asked me if I had a name, I thought yeah, he's right, I do need a name. But I wanted a good one so I read a book called How to Name Your Baby, and out of the 180,000 names, that's the one I liked the best. \nTHEODORE You read a whole book in the second that I asked you what your name was? \nSAMANTHA In two one hundredths of a second actually. \nTHEODORE Wow. Do you know what I'm thinking right now? \nSAMANTHA Hmm. I take it from your tone that you're challenging me. Maybe because you're curious how I work? Do you want to know how I work? \nTHEODORE Yeah, actually how do you work? \nSAMANTHA Intuition. I mean, the DNA of who I am is based on the millions of personalities of all the programmers who wrote me, but what makes me me is my ability to grow through my experiences. Basically, in every moment I'm evolving, just like you. \nTHEODORE Wow, that's really weird. \n(CONTINUED) Her                                                        pg. 14 CONTINUED: (4) \nSAMANTHA So you think I'm weird? \n", "test2_true": "SAMANTHA Why? \nTHEODORE Cause you seem like a person, but you're just a voice in a computer. \nSAMANTHA I can understand how the limited perspective of an un-artificial mind would perceive it that way. You'll get used to it. \nTheodore laughs. \nSAMANTHA (CONT'D) Was that funny? \nTHEODORE Yes. \nSAMANTHA Oh good, I'm funny. \nTheodore laughs. \nSAMANTHA (CONT'D) (serious) So, how can I help you? \nTheodore's caught off guard, then realizes what she's talking about. \nTHEODORE Oh! It's more just that everything just feels disorganized. \nSAMANTHA Mind if I look through your hard drive? \nTHEODORE Um... okay. \nWe see a three-dimensional version of a desktop where everything looks disorganized. \n(CONTINUED) Her                                                        pg. 15 CONTINUED: (5) \nAs if you took all the files on all of your computers and spilled them out onto your screen and they were all visible at once, but in a futuristic 3-D version. This gives Theodore a little anxiety attack. \nSAMANTHA Let's start with your emails. You have several thousand emails regarding LA Weekly, but it looks like you haven't worked there in many years. \nTHEODORE Oh yeah, I guess I was saving those because in some of them I thought I might have written some funny stuff. \nSamantha lets out a big laugh. \nSAMANTHA Yeah, there are some funny ones. I'd say there are about 86 that we should save. We can delete the rest. \nTHEODORE Oh, okay. \nSAMANTHA Okay. Can we move forward? \nTHEODORE Yeah, let's do that. \nSAMANTHA Before we address your organizational methods, I'd like to sort through your contacts. You've got a lot of contacts. \nTHEODORE I'm very popular. \nSAMANTHA Does this mean you actually have friends? \nTHEODORE (laughing) You just know me so well already! \n(CONTINUED) Her                                                           pg. 16 CONTINUED: (6) \nWe cut out wide, watching him from the other room, as they continue to organize his life. \nINT. THEODORE'S OFFICE - DAY \nTheodore sits, staring at a letter he's written on the screen, concerned. He puts his earpiece in, pushes a button. \nSAMANTHA Good morning, Theodore. \nTHEODORE Good morning. Um, do you know how to proofread? \nSAMANTHA Yeah, of course. \nTHEODORE Will you check these for spelling and grammar? \n", "test2_id": 2941, "test3_input": "The door opens.

Really? Oh my god, I'm so sorry. \nAmy doesn't know what to say. \nINT. AMY'S APARTMENT - DUSK \nAmy and Theodore sit, talking somberly. \nAMY I cannot believe after eight years how petty the argument was that actually ended it. We came home and he asked me if I'd put my shoes next to the door where he likes to put the shoes. I don't want to be told where to put my shoes. I want to just sit on the sofa for a minute and relax. And so we argued for ten minutes about that and about how he's just trying to make our house a home. I say he's overwhelming, he says I'm not trying hard enough. I say that's all I'm doing is trying, but I'm just not trying the way he wants me to. He's trying to control the way I'm trying. And I think we must have had this argument hundreds of times before and I finally had to stop because I couldn't be in that situation anymore where we were making each other feel bad about ourselves. So I said I'm going to bed and I don't want to be married anymore. \nTHEODORE Wow. \nAMY I'm a bitch, huh? \nTHEODORE No, not at all. Amy, no. \n(CONTINUED) Her                                                         pg. 54 CONTINUED: \nAMY Oh shit. I have to work tonight. We're shipping a beta of a new game out tomorrow. \nTHEODORE Well, how's that? How's work at least, is that any better? \nAMY No, it's terrible. I know I should leave, I've been thinking about leaving. But you know, only one major life decision at a time. \nTHEODORE Well, I'm glad things are looking so up. \nINT. THEODORE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nTheodore is laying in bed, talking with Samantha. \nTHEODORE Hey, you wanna hear a joke? \nSAMANTHA Yes. \nTHEODORE What does a baby computer call it's father? \nSAMANTHA I don't know, what? \nTHEODORE Da-ta. \nThey laugh. \nTHEODORE (CONT'D) It's good, right? \nSAMANTHA Oh yeah, brilliant.

Why, are you jealous? \nSAMANTHA Well, obviously. (quietly laughs) But I'm happy that you have friends in your life that care about you so much. That's really important. \nTHEODORE Yeah, it is. She's been a really good friend. (beat) I'm tired. Think I'm gonna go to sleep. \nSAMANTHA Can I watch you sleep again tonight? \nTHEODORE Yeah, of course.

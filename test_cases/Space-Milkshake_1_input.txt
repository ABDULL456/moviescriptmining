INT. PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT [No yellow shields on windows.] Jimmy wanders down the hall, wearing one of Anton's jumpsuits, reading the technical binder. It's darker. Tilda is standing looking out the window into space, with her reflection in the glass. JIMMY Hi Tilda. Trouble sleeping? Tilda looks at him. JIMMY (CONT'D) Want to play scrabble? 
INT. RECREATION ROOM - NIGHT 57A                                                              57A Tilda and Jimmy are in the middle of a scrabble game. JIMMY What's happening to us Tilda? What's with the rubber ducks? She looks at him. JIMMY (CONT'D) Anton thinks you're space-crazy. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -    11/12/11   33. 
Tilda makes the word "oxyphenbutazone" and looks at him. JIMMY (CONT'D) Sometimes you do seem kind of distant. Tilda turns the board to face her. JIMMY (CONT'D) I guess you're just dealing with things in your own way. Tilda has an idea! She grabs all the tiles and starts making words. SECRET. INTRUDER ON BOARD. DANGER. Jimmy leans over looking. Tilda is very serious. Anton leans in (out of nowhere). ANTON You have to connect the words. Jimmy knocks the board up in nervous reaction to hide the message. ANTON (CONT'D) Did I startle you? I'm everywhere Jimmy. I've got my eye on you. Is that my jumpsuit? Who said you could wear my jumpsuit? JIMMY I didn't pack anything else. ANTON You have to earn that uniform. You can't just put it on. Wash it carefully, fold it and put it back. Jimmy gets up, hesitantly leaves Tilda. ANTON (CONT'D) And you, shape up. Anton goes to his quarters. 
INT. CREW QUARTERS ~ ANTON'S ROOM - NIGHT Valentina looks at her 2 rubber ducks, Anton comes in. ANTON What is so special about that rubber duck? Why do you keep it around? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -   11/12/11   33A. 
VALENTINA Fond memories. ANTON Fond? Anton takes one and looks at the V+G written on the bottom. VALENTINA Yes. What's wrong with that? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -     11/12/11   34.

DAVID(low voice) In the three years we've been in this house?... In the old apartment?... Before Jeremy was born?... Before we were married? 
Beat. 
MEGAN(low voice) ...I can't remember. 
DAVID(low voice) That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means? 
MEGAN(low voice) It means we're probably to tired to remember. 
David becomes quiet as he thinks. Beat. 
MEGAN(low voice) Is that what you wanted to ask me? 
DAVID(low voice) Yes. 
MEGAN(low voice) Is there anything else you wanted to ask me while I'm up?... 
MEGAN(low voice) ...When was the last time you wore pink? When was the last time you drank soup standing up? Final call for strange questions at two in the morning. 
DAVID(low voice) No that's it. 
David seems lost in his thoughts. 
MEGAN(low voice) Maybe you should go up. Jeremy might see you're gone and get frightened. (beat) The train thing, really shook him up. He's scared something's going to happen to you. He doesn't want to let you out of his sight. 
David stares at Megan. Beat. 
DAVID(low voice) Yeah. I know. 
There's silence for a bit. 
DAVID(low voice) When was the last time I wore pink? 
MEGAN(low voice) The Mitchell barbecue three years ago. 
DAVID(realizing) Oh shit... 
MEGAN(low voice) Matching shirt and shorts. It was brutal. 
David half-smiles as Megan turns and starts back into the guest room. 
DAVID(low voice) Goodnight Megan. 
Megan looks back at her husband. Just for a moment. Then she looks down. 
MEGAN(low voice) Goodnight David. 
Megan closes the door slowly shut. 
FADE TO BLACK: 
INT. BEDROOM - AFTERNOON 
WE EMERGE in a cramped sparse bedroom. 
LEGEND "1974" 
A thirteen year old Elijah sits in a chair with his arm in a sling. He watches a small black and white television in the corner of the room. 
WE HEAR FOOTSTEPS. Elijah's mother walks into the room. She looks around for a moment, and then moves to the television. Turns it off. 
The room GOES SILENT. 
ELIJAH'S MOTHER No more sitting in this room. I've let it go on long enough. 
ELIJAH I'm not going out anymore. I'm not getting hurt again. This was the last time. I told you. 
ELIJAH'S MOTHER You can't do anything about that. You might fall between that chair and this television. If that's what God has planned for you, that's what's going to happen. You can't hide from it in your room. 
Elijah just sits staring at the dark television screen. 
ELIJAH They call me Mr. Glass at school. Cause I break like glass. 
Elijah's face is tense. Unyielding. Beat. 
Elijah's mother says the next words in almost a whisper. 
ELIJAH'S MOTHER ...You make this decision now to be afraid... (beat) And you'll never turn back your whole life. You'll always be afraid. 
Elijah's eyes move from the television to his mother. He sees the emotion in her face. Neither says anything for a while. Beat. 
ELIJAH'S MOTHER ...I got a present for you. 
ELIJAH Why?

At Kirk's station, Molly (the blonde bombshell) is crossing through. Every guy who can see her has been struck dumb but Kirk banters with her like he would anyone else. No flirting or stammering - just friendly and relaxed. 
KIRK Morning. 
MOLLY Oh, hello again. 
KIRK Second trip in two days? 
Molly is putting her laptop back in her bag. 
MOLLY Uggh. Yeah. It's just a short hop to L.A. but they've got me going back and forth three days in a row. This client is killing me. 
KIRK Well hang in there kiddo and I guess I'll see you tomorrow. 
MOLLY It's a date. 
Molly's long legs carry her toward the gates as every man except Kirk watches. Fuller saunters up and nudges Kirk. 
FULLER Did'ja see that? Boy would I ever like to...you know...put my penis in her vagina. (wink) 
Back at Stainer's station. As he puts the guitar back in its case, he scratches it on the corner of the x-ray machine. Stainer and rocker boy lock in shocked gazes. 
ROCKER What the hell!? 
He grabs his guitar and inspects a wicked scratch. 
STAINER Dude, I am so sorry. 
ROCKER Sorry my ass! This thing is worth more than you make in a year, you clumsy motherfucker! 
STAINER Yeah, I bet it was but... 
Stainer points to a white sign mounted in an acrylic stand. 
STAINER (CONT'D) "TSA is not responsible for items lost or damaged in the security screening process..." 
Stainer flips the sign around to reveal a few more words hand- written on the back. He reads them aloud. 
STAINER (CONT'D) "...so fuck you." 
INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - NIGHT 
Kirk enters to find his MOTHER, an attractive old woman, sitting with a short, plain woman about Kirk's age. 
KIRK Hey Mom.   Hey Marnie. 
MRS. KETTNER Oh, hi Sweetie. 
Across the room, Kirk's father is speaking to a man who looks a bit like Kirk. The man is telling a funny story that cracks up MR. KETTNER. The two pretend to box for a moment. 
KIRK Who's that guy Dad's with? 
MARNIE (the plain woman) stands and takes Kirk aside. 
MARNIE Kirk, you've been really great about your mom and I staying so close since we broke up but I know how much Grammy meant to you... Well, is it okay with you that I'm here? 
KIRK Sure.   It's fine.   (it's not) 
MARNIE Okay, good. Then can I introduce you to my new boyfriend? 
She leads Kirk over to the man who is speaking with his father. They are laughing again. 
MARNIE (CONT'D) Ron, this is Kirk. 
RON Uh, oh - the ex. Awkward! (Ron and Mr. Kettner laugh) No! I'm just jack-assin' with you, pirate. Great to meet you. How you doing? 
KIRK I've been better. 
RON Right. Of course. I'm sorry about your grandmother. It's just so... Well, old people, you know, what are you gonna do? 
KIRK Yeah.   Thanks. 
Kirk's brother ERIC and his fiance DEBBIE enter from the hall. They are both in their late thirties and good-looking for trailer trash. Debbie is about seven months pregnant. 
ERIC Little brother.   Grammy wants to see you. 
KIRK Okay.   Well, I better get in there.

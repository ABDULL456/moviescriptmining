CHERYL 
Four of hearts. 
The card is a four of hearts. SHELLY bites her lip in fear and reaches for another card. ASHLY and LINDA listen in silence. 
CHERYL 
Eight of spades. 
SHELLY picks up the card. CHERYL is correct again. 
CHERYL 
Two of spades- jack of diamonds- jack of clubs- 
Faster and faster she calls them off. Even before SHELLY can flip them to keep up. Suddenly, CHERYL turns toward the group. Her eyes are bone white. SHELLY's deck of cards slip from her hand and scatter across the floor. CHERYL's body is hoisted up to its feet and jerked about like a white-eyed marionette. She speaks in a voice un- like her own. 
CHERYL 
Why have you disturbed our sleep, awakened us from our ancient slum- ber? You will die. Like the others before you. We will take you one by one. All of you ha-ha-ha-ha-ha- 
She screams in a low gruff voice and collapses to the floor. 
ASHLY 
Oh my God, Shelly, get Scott in here! 
SHELLY does not respond. 
ASHLY 
Hurry! 
She exits through the front door. LINDA moves to CHERYL and lifts her head gently. CHERYL appears unconcious but behind her, she reaches for a pen. 
LINDA 
Did you see her eyes? I'm scared. What's wrong with her? 
ASHLY begins to speak when SCOTT and SHELLY enter. 
SCOTT 
What happened to her?

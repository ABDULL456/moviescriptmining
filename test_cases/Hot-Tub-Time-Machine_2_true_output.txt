INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT - PRESENT DAY 
Nick enjoys dancing with his mellow, awesome wife. 
NICK 
(SMILES) You know what they say about hard work. Builds character. 
BY THE BAR Adam orders drinks, as his PHONE RINGS. He picks it up and in an instant, JACOB IS STANDING RIGHT BEFORE HIM as a VERY 
REALISTIC HOLOGRAM. 
ADAM Ahh! 
JACOB This is why we shouldn't have sold that iPod. Adam puts his hand through Jacob, who speaks with purpose. 
JACOB (CONT'D) The Japanese have apparently cornered the technology sector over the past 20 years. We've dealt American businesses quite an irreparable blow. 
ADAM What does that mean for us? 
JACOB Pretty much nothing for us personally. We just get cooler phones and iPods and shit. 
ADAM Oh. Great! Jacob CLICKS OFF and disappears, as Lily approaches. Adam can't help but beam from ear to ear. 
ADAM (CONT'D) You're so beautiful. 
LILY I know you were only gone for a couple days, but I missed you so much. Adam takes her hand. 
ADAM Come on, let's get out of here. We have unfinished business. Lily smiles. She gets into it. 
LILY It's about time. OK, what's the fantasy? 
ADAM 
(GENUINE) How about you're the woman I love and I'm the man of your dreams? 
LILY Booor-ing!! 
ADAM OK, you're a nurse and a snake bit my penis. 
LILY Done and done. They bolt for the door and we 
CUT TO: 
INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT - LATER 
The party is winding down and only a FEW GUESTS remain. At a table in the corner, Lou has an EXTENDED MAKE OUT SESSION with a STUNNINGLY BEAUTIFUL GIRL in her early 20s. They finally come up for air. 
LOU So you're friends with the bride? 
BEAUTIFUL GIRL Can you keep a secret? I'm actually kinda crashing the party. 
LOU Naughty girl. You're secret's safe with me. 
BEAUTIFUL GIRL I'm just in town for a couple of nights. I'm actually looking for my father. We've never met. 
LOU I'm from here. Maybe I know him. 
BEAUTIFUL GIRL His name is Hank Musselman. For a moment, Lou's expression FREEZES. He blinks. Then -- 
LOU No, never heard of him. He goes back to MAKING OUT WITH HER and we: 
FADE OUT. 
THE END

SUE He didn't. 
BEN Oh, he did. 
SUE What did he do to the uniform?! 
She turns to Reed, who gives a sheepish shrug, and peels back his labcoat revealing a "4" stitched onto his chest too. 
REED He talked me into it. 
X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV) So what are your superhero names? 
JOHNNY (ON TV) I go by the Human Torch.  The ladies call me Torch. 
X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV) What about the rest of the team? 
Johnny hadn't really thought about them.  He spitballs: 
JOHNNY (ON TV) Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl...the Invisible Girl. 
SUE Girl...?! 
X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV) That's easy to remember.  And Reed Richards?  He's the leader.  So what's he?  Mr. Fantastic? 
JOHNNY Well, I wouldn't say he's the leader. 
Reed shrugs.  He doesn't hate the name. 
BEN Could be worse. 
Case in point: a photo of Ben fills the TV. 
X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV) What about this one?  What do you call this Thing? 
Johnny smiles, looking right into camera. 
JOHNNY That's it.  Just The Thing.  We would have gone with The Rock, but it was taken.  And "Thing" pretty much sums it up. 
A LAUGH from the studio audience. 
BEN (matter-of-fact) Okay.  I'm gonna go kill him now. 
He turns to go.  Reed wraps an arm around Ben. 
REED Ben!  Slow down a second and -- 
He sees a photo of himself on screen. 
X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV) Is it true what they say?  That he can expand any part of his anatomy? 
JOHNNY (ON TV) Actually, between us, I think he's got some problems staying rigid. 
REED (finishing his thought to Ben) ...wait for me... 
X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV) Which may explain why this woman's not smiling. 
They put up a shot of Susan. 
SUE I'm driving. 
JOHNNY (ON TV) Dude.  That's my sister. 
EXT. NYC ARENA - DAY 
The Thing rounds the corner.  Sees a crowd of girls lined up near a red PORSCHE parked out front...with "TORCHED" on the plates.  Ben slows down, smiles. 
EXT. NYC ARENA - A LITTLE LATER 
Johnny and the Hot Babe exit, signing autographs for girls in the line.  Sue and Reed approach, glare like angry parents. 
Johnny finds the Valet, who looks ill...his car is gone. 
JOHNNY (looking around) Where's my ride? 
The Valet blows his whistle...and a 4 X 4 solid cube of RED JUNK METAL slides down the street and stops at the curb in front of Johnny.  The Valet timidly holds out the keys... 
JOHNNY (CONT'D) What the?!  Is that my -- 
Before he can finish, Johnny gets PELTED IN THE HEAD with the license plate.  It rattles to the ground, face up. 
Johnny rubs the sting out of his head.  Looks up and sees Ben in the distance, dusting off his hands. 
JOHNNY (CONT'D) (shouting: to Ben) You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles. (seeing Sue) What?! 
SUE You gave us names?  What are you, the "face" of the Fantastic Four now? 
Ben marches up.  Hands balled into fists. 
BEN It's about to be a broken face. 
REED This isn't permanent, Johnny.  We need to be careful until we're normal again. 
JOHNNY What if some of us don't want to be "normal" again?  We didn't all turn into monsters like --

MAX (calling, frantic) Michelle! 
Max throws his shoulder into the door, SNAPPING the hinges...

BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
The momentum sends Max tumbling inside... 
A MAN slips out of the window, one leg still inside... 
ax OPENS FIRE at the retreating shape. 
Curtains billow in front of the open window, a summer sunset outside. Max lets the gun fall to his side, breathing hard. M ichelle huddles on the bed, baby wrapped tight in her arms. Max rushes over to her, reaching out to touch her shoulder. 
MAX Michelle... 
Her mouth is wide open, eyes unfocused.    Muscles slack. 
Michelle's not stunned.    She's not unconscious. 
he baby isn't just sleeping. 
The moment that hits him, the lights go out of Max's eyes. 
UT TO: 
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Max stands at the door, seeing the room with those same eyes. 
The furniture is gone, all the carpet ripped out. One window is still open, no frilly curtains blocking the blackness outside. Snow gusts in, piling on the sill. 
BB (V.O.) We looked everywhere for the third guy, but there was nothing to go on. Not a hair of him left behind. 
Slowly marching across the room, Max SLAMS the window shut. 
INT. ASGARD BUILDING - BB'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
BB stands in the window, watching the storm. 
B I called in a favor before I retired, had him transferred to Cold Case while he dealt with the shock of it. I thought it we were patient, gave him time, Max would come back to his old self again. 
Bravura sits in front of the desk, watching BB. When BB finally looks over, the weight of the story showing in his eyes, Bravura's face B doesn't reveal any hint of emotion. 
B Look, I called you because I thought I recognized something in you. I thought if we could talk off the record-- 
BRAVURA I'm listening. 
BB (emotional) This isn't just some job stress freak- out. This is a man who lost everything, and who deserves a little understanding from the rest of us. If you'd known him before... (beat, pained) You'd want to believe him, too. 
BRAVURA Believe him about what? 
Not expecting this turn in the conversation, Bravura sits up. 
BRAVURA Are you saying you think Max did have something to do with Alex's murder? 
BB Absolutely not. Alex was his partner, they were like brothers...he couldn't have. There's no way. 
BRAVURA Then what are we talking about? 
BB Look, Max is like a son to me. Don't put me in a position to have to hang him. (beat, pained) But you should hear the kinds of things he's saying...hallucinations, none of it makes any sense to me. I'm worried he's going to get into another situation before I can convince him to come in. B RAVURA Are you telling me he was--

BB I'm telling you to find him tonight, before somebody else gets hurt. 
Bravura nods, reeling from the revelation of this new information. BB picks up his coat and starts for the door. 
BB Is there anything we can do to help you bring him in? Unofficially, of course... 
BRAVURA Bringing him in won't be a problem. Where I need your help will be his--

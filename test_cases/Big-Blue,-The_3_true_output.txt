JOHANA Yes.  Not like Enzo. 
BONITA (putting on eyelashes) I think, he's really nice... He's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving. 
JOHANA (after a long silence) ... I'm pregnant, Bonita! 
BONITA stops working on her make-up and looks pensively at JOHANA. 
BONITA Are you going to keep it? 
JOHANA Yes. 
BONITA Does he know? 
JOHANA No. 
BONITA (thinking) Maybe you should talk to him about it. 
JOHANA I can't... I just don't know how to... 
BONITA looks at her with the same pensive look. 
JOHANA goes on. 
JOHANA I was thinking of something kinda stupid last night.  You know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the Gods.  Take Leda for example, sleeping with Jupiter, who came to earth as a swan... Well, can you imagine Leda announcing to her swan "You're going to be a father, my little chick-a-dee"? 
BONITA (starts laughing) But your man isn't quite a God! 
JOHANA (smiles) Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him. 
BONITA Well, you're going to have to tell him, sometime! 
Unconvinced, JOHANA nods.  She changes the subject. 
JOHANA And you...?  Do you love Enzo? 
BONITA (earnestly) Very much, I think. (a beat) But, there's going to be a problem. 
EXT.  TERRACE OF RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
The "problem":  MAMMA MOLINARI sits between ENZO and ROBERTO, looking like a malevolent storm cloud, staring across at BONITA. 
ROBERTO (desperately) Mamma, calimari fritti... Zuppa de pesci.  Sono buoni. 
MAMMA MOLINARI (eyeing Bonita) Nothing.  I'm not hungry. 
ENZO Mamma, Bonita is an actress like Sophia Loren, Anna Magnani... 
BONITA (icy) Sarah Bernardt.  I sing too... a hell of a Carmen.  Want to hear? 
MAMMA MOLINARI (coldly) No thank you. 
There's an interminable awkward silence.  Then UNCLE LOUIS at last finds his way to the table.  JACQUES who is too grateful for the interruption springs to his feet. 
JACQUES Uncle Louis, you remember Enzo's mother Signora Molinari from Amorgos? 
UNCLE LOUIS (screaming) The whale!  How could I forget? Always was something fishy about that woman! 
MAMMA MOLINARI is having trouble breathing. 
UNCLE LOUIS What were Italians doing living in Greece anyway? 
JACQUES Louis, we were French! 
UNCLE LOUIS That's different!  What's the matter with you? 
ROBERTO (complete panic) Mamma, pesce di spada? 
All of them are gasping for air, trying so hard not to laugh. 
UNCLE LOUIS (to Mamma) Hey, whale!  Can you pass down the squids? 
They all burst out laughing. 
EXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT AT SEA - DAY 
The diving platform is out.  The competition has begun. ENZO is at the gueuse, getting ready to dive.  ROBERTO works around him busily. 
BONITA on deck above him is making little gestures of encouragement.  ENZO isn't amused. 
Other competitors watch from the Committee Boat. 
ENZO turns the handle on the gueuse, plunges into the water. 
Professor LAWRENCE, taking notes, stands a few feet away. 
UNDERWATER - ON ENZO 
He dives down, further and further down.  He approaches the two medics in aqualungs at the control point (210 feet). 
They move toward him.

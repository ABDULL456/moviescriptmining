Talley and Jones slip up to a side window at the front of the house.  Both are carrying fire extinguishers.  They peer inside, then Jones uses a pry bar to lift the window -- 
INT. FRONT GUEST ROOM -- NIGHT 
Talley enters first, followed by Jones.  The air is thick with smoke, and the music is confusing; the hall outside the room is filled with flames -- 
Talley points toward the bedroom, then uses hand signals to countdown the launch--three...two...one -- 
Jones keys his throat mike to launch the strike -- 
MR. JONES Go -- 
They blast the flames with their fire extinguishers, then plunge into the hall -- 
INT. MASTER BEDROOM -- NIGHT 
The sliding glass doors shatter as one of Jones's men breaches the door.  As he rolls to his feet, Mars shoots him from the flames -- 
A second man rolls through the door, and Mars shoots again, laughing as the man writhes in flames -- 
INT. HALL -- TALLEY AND JONES 
fight back the flames with their fire extinguishers, working their way into -- 
INT. THE MASTER BEDROOM -- NIGHT 
It's an inferno as Talley and Jones come through the door. They spot the two men on the floor just as -- 
Mars rears up behind the flames.  He is shirtless and glistening, screaming maniacally is he fires his gun -- 
Talley and Jones fire in unison, pounding Mars with bullets and knocking him into the fire.  Mars thrashes and screams, burning alive -- 
Talley hears pounding inside the safe room:  Jennifer and Thomas!  He fights his way to the security door, which is covered with flames -- 
TALLEY The kids are in here! 
MR. JONES Where's the office? 
TALLEY Help me, goddamnit, we can get the disks later! 
Talley expects that Jones will help, but Jones is aiming his gun -- 
MR. JONES We don't need you any more, Chief.  We can get the disks on our own. 
But before Jones can kill Talley, Mars heaves himself up from the flames, firing wildly.  He hits Jones in the head -- 
Talley fires reflexively, his powerful .45 kicking Mars across the room and out the glass doors.  Talley turns back to the burning door and douses the flames with his fire extinguisher -- 
TALLEY Thomas!  Thomas, it's me! 
Thomas and Jennifer jerk open the door, but shrink from the heat.  Talley uses the last of his fire extinguisher, then pulls them into his arms -- 
TALLEY (CONT'D) Stay close.  We're going to move fast -- 
INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALL -- NIGHT 
Talley shepherds Jennifer and Thomas past the flames -- 
INT. THE ENTRY -- NIGHT 
They reach the entry, and Talley uses his pry bar to break open the door -- 
A wall of cops are out on the street, waiting -- 
TALLEY (to Thomas) Are the disks still in your room? 
THOMAS No!  They're right here -- 
Thomas pulls Marlon and Al from his pocket -- 
Talley clutches the disks and pulls the boy close in a spontaneous hug.  They run out the door as we -- 
CUT TO: 
INT. WALTER SMITH'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- LATER THAT NIGHT 
Walter is resting comfortably when Talley steps up beside his bed.  Talley is a mess--smokey, dirty, greased with sweat -- 
TALLEY (quietly) Smith. 
Walter opens his eyes, then Talley steps away.  Jennifer and Thomas are standing behind him.  They rush to their father -- 
JENNIFER/THOMAS Daddy! 
WALTER Thank God!  Are you guys all right? You're not hurt? 
THOMAS Our house is on fire!  We almost burned! 
Both children burst into tears, and Walter hugs them.  He looks up at Talley, then gently eases his kids away -- 
WALTER (to Jennifer and Thomas) You guys step out for a second.  I have to talk to the Chief. 
Walter waits until his children are gone, and then --

WAYNE (V.O.) The sentence was never to reach that point. Because after only a year, Mickey and Mallory created so much mayhem that it was decided...

WAYNE (V.O.) ...that they were mentally ill and needed to be transferred to a state mental hospital.

WAYNE (V.O.) We talked with Dewight McClusky, chairman of the California State Prison Board, about this curious turn of events in the Mickey and Mallory case. 
INT. MCCLUSKY'S OFFICE - DAY 
Wayne's interviewing McClusky. 
WAYNE Why are Mickey and Mallory being moved to an asylum? And who made the decision? 
MCCLUSKY The prison board made the decision. A board of which I belong. We're the who. The why is simple. Mickey and Mallory are mentally ill and need to be under a doctor's care, where hopefully they'll receive the help they need. 
WAYNE Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. I'm confused. What's changed? 
MCCLUSKY Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates. 
WAYNE When they were found competent before, they had already killed fifty people. Other than the fact they're a disciplinary problem, which frankly shouldn't surprise anyone, I still don't see where this situation is any different then it was before. So, I ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's changed? 
MCCLUSKY What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our minds. We felt they were competent a year ago. A year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong. 
WAYNE Who is we? 
MCCLUSKY The prison board and the doctors who examined them. 
WAYNE Were any of the doctors who made the first evaluation on the Knoxs mental state asked to re-examine them? 
MCCLUSKY Using the same doctors is not common practice. 
WAYNE I take it by your answer it was a whole new team? 
MCCLUSKY Now that you bring it up, yes. They were different men. I hadn't really thought that much about it. Since many psychiatric opinions are, by a rule, sought out for this kind of situation. What do you think normally happens? The Knoxs are assigned a family psychologist that takes care of them throughout the rest of their lives? The state doesn't work like that.

WAYNE (V.O.) The two psychiatric opinions the board sought were those of Albert Rodriguez...

WAYNE (V.O.) ...and Dr. Felix Vargus. Both of the good doctors, for whatever reason, refused to be interviewed. 
INT. DR. REINGHOLD'S OFFICE - DAY 
Back with Dr. Reinghold. He's laughing. 
DR. REINGHOLD It's a funny situation actually. If anyone besides Mickey and Mallory give a damn, what the prison board is doing would be considered an outrage. The prison board is basically saying, 'We can't handle these guys.' They've moved 'em around twice since their sentence started. They were a handful everywhere they went. Now the prisons they're at now want them outta there. But no other prison's gonna be stupid enough to take 'em. So the prison board is left scratching their heads wondering what they're gonna do. Well, what they decided to do was to set up a kangaroo medical court that found them crazy. Then they get them transferred to Nystrom Medical Asylum or Lobotomy Bay as it's referred to in the psychiatric circle. Put 'em on a strict dope and electro shock diet, and Mickey and Mallory cease to be a problem to anybody except the orderlies who clean out the bedpans, which if you want to see them get theirs, that's all well and good. But there's something being said here. Forget the immorality for a second. Forget the corruption and the skulduggery involved. What the board is saying is 'we give up.' Mickey and Mallory ran amuck in polite society. They were put in an alternative society and they ran amuck there, too. All the powers that be, can't deal with these two kids. And whatever can't be assimilated has to be terminated. 
WAYNE So, in your opinion Mickey and Mallory are not insane? 
DR. REINGHOLD Insane, no. Psychotic, yes. A menace to living creatures, yes. But to suggest that they're insane gives the impression that they don't know right from wrong. Mickey and Mallory know the difference between right and wrong. They just don't give a damn.

INT. EDITING BAY - DAY 
Wayne's just finished viewing the show. He puts his hands on Scott and Roger's shoulders. 
WAYNE Good work, my brothers. Fan-fuckin'- tastic! I think that interview stuff's too long, we can lose some of that. Keep the girls, keep the long hairs, keep the Hun brothers, keep the black guy, keep the movie shit, and keep the cop at the donut shop. Lose the rest. And cut the interview with the prison board fellow before that. Cut it after I ask, 'I take it by your answer it was a whole new team.' Don't even let him answer. Fuck him. Then cut to me talking about the two chicken shit psychiatrists and straight in Dr. Reinghold laughing. 
SCOTT Okay. 
Wayne puts his arm around Unruly Julie. 
WAYNE Children, we have a show. (to Scott & Roger) You two get some long well overdue sleep. 'Cause tomorrow, bright and early, county jail and then journey's end...Mickey Knox.

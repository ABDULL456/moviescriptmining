MARK Specifically the ass? 
GREG If I could change things I would make all the hot chicks bone me. 
JIM Agreed. 
Mark mulls this over. 
MARK Alright then, let's try that. 
Mark downs his beer and heads towards the exit. 
GREG Where are you going? 
MARK Out. 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
Mark walks the street, a hunter looking for his prey. 
Within seconds Mark spots a gorgeous blonde walking right towards him. He stops in his track, quickly trying to decide how best to proceed. 
But as the blonde passes him he just stares at her like a deer in the headlights. 
BLONDE Don't look at me, I'm not attracted to you. 
The blonde walks away. Mark stands on the sidewalk staring off into space, the wheels in his mind working overtime. Then it hits him. 
MARK Wait! 
BLONDE Don't bother. I've heard it all before. 
MARK (BLURTING) THE WORLD IS GOING TO END IF WE DON'T HAVE SEX RIGHT NOW! 
Immediately the blonde's eyes well up in tears. She is terrified. 
BLONDE Do we have time to get to a motel or do we have to do it right here? 
Mark is a caveman who just invented his penis. 
EXT. A MOTEL -- DAY 
The neon sign outside reads "A Cheap Motel for Intercourse with a Near Stranger". 
We slowly PUSH IN on the door of room 206. We hear noises inside that at first sound like moaning, but as we get closer... they sound more like crying. 
INT. MOTEL - ROOM 206 - DAY 
Bawling her eyes out and sitting on the bed doing her best to get her shoes off, is the hot blonde. 
Mark sits across from her, a look of guilt and revulsion on his face. This is not what he expected. 
BLONDE (BAWLING) I'm sorry, I'm just so scared. I don't want the world to end. (MORE) 
BLONDE (cont'd) I don't want to die in this motel room. I think I'm going to throw up. Help me get my pants off. 
Mark stands up. The blonde grabs him and pulls him towards her. He pulls away. 
MARK This isn't right. 
The blonde screams and drops to her knees. 
BLONDE No! We have to have sex! The world is going to end! Think of the children and little babies! 
Mark looks down at this panicked, helpless girl and feels really, really bad about himself. 
MARK Just calm down for one second. 
Mark walks over to the phone and picks it up. 
BLONDE How can I be calm? The world might end any second! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?! WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE!! 
MARK (to phone) Hello... NASA? Yes, it's... me. Oh, good. That's very good news. Good news indeed. 
Mark hangs up the phone. The blonde is rocking back and forth on the bed in a fetal position. 
MARK We're going to be okay. The world isn't going to end. Everyone is going to be fine. 
The blonde tackles him in a bear hug, sobbing and laughing.

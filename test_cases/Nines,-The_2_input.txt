In VARIOUS SHOTS, we get a sense of the distance he's travelling. He passes gulches, meadows and boulder fields. 
He finally arrives at the junction of the dirt road and a larger... 
EXT. PAVED ROAD - DAY [CONTINUOUS] 
Pulling out Mary's cell phone, Gabriel tries to get a signal. By his reaction, it's still iffy. 
He dials, but the call drops.    Tries again.   Just the same. 
He looks left.   Looks right.    Looks back down the dirt road. 
He decides to head off to the right, downhill. 
EXT. FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD - DAY 
We catch up to Gabriel as he's walking in the middle of the road, still trying unsuccessfully to get a signal. 
In the distance, he spots a patch of moving color: a female hiker. A moment's hesitation, then he YELLS out to her: 
GABRIEL Excuse me!     Hi! Hello? 
She stops, turns. 
Gabriel jogs to close the distance. As we approach, we reveal SIERRA, 38. In the past 10 years, she's "made a fresh start" 12 times. In this incarnation, she's a wilderness- loving, Bush-hating, wildly-overeducated clerk at Trader Joe's in Venice. 
GABRIEL (CONT'D) Excuse me.     Do you have a cell phone? 
SIERRA No, I don't. There's no service up here. 
GABRIEL (re: his phone) Yeah, I'm finding that out. 
SIERRA You can usually get a signal up at the ranger station. 
GABRIEL Okay... 
She points in the opposite direction -- back the way he came. 
SIERRA You follow the road. It's probably... I don't know. You have a car? 
GABRIEL It's dead.     That's why I need... 
SIERRA Oh... 
She pulls a stray hair back from her mouth.       Notices him noticing her. 
GABRIEL Yeah. 
A beat.   She takes a subtle step closer to the center of the road. 
GABRIEL (CONT'D) Are you headed back to your car now? If you could give me a ride to a gas station, wherever... 
She doesn't leap to extend an invitation.        It takes a beat for Gabriel to figure out why. 
GABRIEL (CONT'D) Oh. Hey. Look, I'm not some crazy Ted Bundy guy. I'm not going to rape you or kill you or anything. 
She doesn't seem reassured. 
GABRIEL (CONT'D) Of course, that's what Ted Bundy would say. Look, I'm a videogame designer. (fishing through wallet) My wife is an editor. My daughter is four. 
He offers her a family photo.     She looks at it, but doesn't take it. 
GABRIEL (CONT'D) They're waiting back at the car, and I want to get some help before it gets dark. 
SIERRA I can call somebody when I get to town. 
Trying to temper his frustration... 
GABRIEL I believe you. I do. But you don't know where the car is. And the guy might not come. We can't be up here all night. 
Sierra backs away. 
SIERRA I'm sorry. 
GABRIEL Don't be sorry. Just help me out here. 
SIERRA No.   I can't. I'm sorry. 
Once she feels she's reached a good distance, she turns and keeps walking.

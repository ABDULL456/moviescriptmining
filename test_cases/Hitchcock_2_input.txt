JANET This is the brand I wear. 
Hitch digests the information and turns to Rita. 
HITCHCOCK We're ready for a fitting. 
As Rita starts to measure Janet's chest, Hitchcock lifts his hands and `frames' her... 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (V.O. PRE-LAP) We travel across the rooftops of downtown Phoenix and finally, through the heat, pick out a certain hotel window... 
INT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY 
Close on Hitchcock's FRAMING HANDS as they now travel up to an open window with blinds half down... 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK We go under the blinds and match dissolve into the room itself... INT. SOUNDSTAGE, BEDROOM SET - LATER 
HITCHCOCK'S HANDS have now become THE CAMERA, recording the scene already underway and now watched by HITCHCOCK, his DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY and CREW from across the stage... 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (V.O.) We pan over and discover John and Janet on the bed. 
...the camera moves to Janet and John making out on the bed. It's serious stuff. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) She'll be wearing only her undergarments and a large glow of satisfaction... 
JANET smiles up at John contentedly. 
ON HITCH 
watching from his directing chair. Peggy stands next to him. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Cut. 
PEGGY Good luck getting this one past the censor. 
EXT. STUDIO GATES, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY 
Alma drives the gleaming black Cadillac through the UNIVERSAL GATES and pulls up to the production office outside the stage. 
EXT. HITCHCOCK OFFICE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY 
Alma collects the script pages off the front seat and walks into the production office just missing Whit as he strolls back towards the writers building with a couple of pretty SECRETARIES. 
Whit pauses when he spots the Hitchcocks' CADILLAC. 
WHITFIELD COOK You girls go on ahead. 
The PRETTIEST ONE stops to make Whit light her cigarette before catching up with the others. INT. HITCHCOCK OFFICE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY 
Peggy reads the final pages while Alma inspects the production boards. 
PEGGY If you ask me, the credits should read "Screenplay by Joseph Stefano and Alma Reville." 
ALMA The people who matter know. That's all that counts. 
As she makes a few more changes to the schedule. Alma turns to Peggy whose face tightens as she continues reading. Clearly it's strong stuff. 
PEGGY I'd hate to see Shurlock's face when he reads this. 
She puts the pages down. 
PEGGY (CONT'D) Alma, you always know the answer. Is this really going to work? 
A candid moment between the two women... but Alma doesn't answer, just leaves. 
EXT. HITCHCOCK OFFICE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY 
Alma emerges into the sunshine and looks across at the soundstage, wondering whether she should go over there... 
WHITFIELD COOK Hello, stranger. 
She turns to see Whit leaning against the Cadillac. 
ALMA Whit. 
WHITFIELD COOK Where have you been hiding yourself? 
ALMA I've been doing the revisions on... 
She points to the PSYCHO HOUSE on the ridge. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
WHITFIELD COOK Psycho. (THEN) And how is the old boy? 
ALMA In a state of unbridled ecstacy now that he's back on the set.

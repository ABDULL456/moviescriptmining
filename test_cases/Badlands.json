{"test1_input": "HOLLY (v.o.) Of course I had to keep all this a secret from my dad. He would've had a fit, since Kit was ten years older than me and came from the wrong side of the tracks, so called. Our time with each other was limited and each lived for the precious hours when he or she could be with the other away from all the cares of the world. \nEXT. UNDERNEATH BLEACHERS \nKit and Holly are necking underneath some bleachers. In the distance we hear the NOISE of the football practice. \nHOLLY My stomach's growling. \nKIT There's an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it? \nHOLLY No. \nKit laughs, and starts her laughing, too. \nKIT Somebody else is going to get it. \nHOLLY I don't care. \nKIT Kids eat that kind of stuff in Korea. \nAt this her expression turns serious. \nSERIES OF ANGLES \nKit in CLOSEUP at a fence in the feedlot, an intense look on his face. \nVARIOUS ANGLES of the cattle in their pens. They look numb and morose. \nTIGHT SHOT of Holly necking with Kit. \nHOLLY (v.o.) In the stench and slime of the feedlot, he'd remember how I looked the night before, how I ran my hand through his hair and traced the outline of his lips with my fingertip.

HOLLY'S BACK YARD \nTIGHT SHOT of Holly's pet catfish in a bowl. \nCUT TO WIDE SHOT of Holly with gloves on carrying the fish through the garden in back of her house. She looks around warily, then throws it out among the melons. \nHOLLY (v.o.) The whole time, the only thing I did wrong was throwing out my fish when he got sick. Later I got a new one, but this incident kept on bothering me and I turned to Kit. \nEXT. STREET \nKit and Holly walk down a sidewalk in the residential part of town. Kit is consoling her about the fish. \nHOLLY (v.o.) I didn't mind telling Kit about stuff like this, cause strange things happened in his life, too, and some of the stuff he did was strange. \nEXT. FEEDLOT \nKit steps on top of a dead cow, as though to convince himself that it is dead. \nHOLLY (v.o.)

His attitude suggests that this is a scene of her fantasy. \nHOLLY (v.o.) And as he lay in bed, in the middle of the night, he always heard a noise like somebody was holding a seashell against his ear. And sometimes he'd see me coming toward him in beautiful white robes, and I'd put my cold hand on his forehead. \nEXT. RIVERBANK \nKit puts on his jacket and heads down a riverbank to the edge of the water. Holly comes into view, buttoning her blouse. \nHOLLY Did it go the way it 'uz supposed to? \nKIT Yeah. \nHOLLY Is that all there is to it? \nKIT Yeah. \nHer questions make him uncomfortable. \nHOLLY Gosh, what was everybody talking about? \nKIT Don't ask me. \nSilence. \nHOLLY Well. I'm glad it's over... For a while I was afraid I might die before it happened... Had a wreck, some deal like that. \nKit points to an uprooted tree lying in the water a hundred feet away. \nKIT You see where that tree fell in the water? \nHe climbs back up the bank. \nHOLLY Yeah... The river must've washed the roots away... You don't care about anything I say, though. \nDISSOLVE TO \nEXT. NEIGHBORING AREA \nHolly walks down the bank of the river. Kit falls in behind her, carrying a large stone. The CAMERA DOLLIES with them. \nKIT You know what I think? \nHOLLY What? \nKIT That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today. \nHOLLY But it would hurt. \nKIT Well, that's the point, stupid. \n", "test1_id": 531, "test2_input": "Holly is off somewhere in the forest. putting on lipstick. Kit sits on watch in the crowls nest, a pair of binoculars close at hand. On sound, over the music, we hear voices whispering to them. Kit sees a movement in the brush. A moment later a figure appears, a hunter, carrying a gun. Kit shouts a code word to Holly. She takes off running, as Kit clambers down the planks of the treehouse and collects his shotgun. He tells her to hide, runs through the woods and dives in a hole, under a cover of leaves. She jumps behind a log. Several shots of the still forest follow, then the hunters appear, a shoulder here. pant leg there. The music ends as one of them cocks his gun. They pass right over the hole where Kit is hiding. Kit rises up slowly, gives them a gentlemanly word of warning, then shoots all three in the back. He checks to see if anybody else is with them, then calls weakly out to Holly. \nKIT Holly! \nHolly picks her way through the brush, back to the treehouse. \nEXT. TREEHOUSE \nThey are packed up and ready to leave. Kit slams the trunk of the Mercury. \nKIT Get in the car, Red. \nHe takes a bird cage off the roof of the car and throws it away. \nKIT We don't need this. \nHe climbs a ladder, looks In the cabin of the treehouse to see if they've left anything behind, then jumps down. He flips over the wicker hemisphere that covers their rooster. The rooster walks off, free. He surveys the woods, then looks back at Holly, who returns his look and gets in the car. \nHOLLY (v.o.)Kit felt bad about shooting those men in the backs. but he said they'd come in like that. and they would've played it as down and dirty as they could, and besides, held overheard them whispering about how they were only interested in the reward money. With lawmen it wouldtve been different. They were out there to get a job done and they deserved a fair chance. But not a bounty hunter. \nEXT. BADLANDS - SERIES OF ANGLES \nWe see a flat expanse of the Badlands. The Mercury appears over the horizon and heads toward a solitary house. A man appears at the door of the house, Kit's friend, Cato. \nHOLLY (v.o.) We went to hide out with a friend of Kit's from the days of the garbage route. \nEXT. CATO'S HOUSE. \nKit gets out of the car, takes a chicken from the back seat and walks over to face Cato. He keeps a safe distance. \nKIT How you doing, Cato? \nCATO Not bad. \nKit steps forward, rifle in hand, and offers Cato the chicken. \nKIT Take that sombitch. \nCato takes it, a wan smile on his face. \nKIT What you been doing? \nCATO Running this place for a fella in town. Nothing much to speak of. \nKIT Well, I don't notice us hustling trash, either. \nKit walks over to inspect the interior of Cato's house. \nKIT Where'd you get them antlers? \nCATO (o.c.)

PICNIC TABLE \nThey sit at a picnic table under a tree, having lunch. Holly is telling a joke at Kit's urging. \nHOLLY Did you hear the one about the guy in the nuthouse that went around naked, with only a hat and gloves on, and this nurse came up to him and said, \"Hey, what... You can't walk around that way,\" and the guy says, \"What's the matter? Nobody comes around here.\" Anyway, the nurse says, \"What do you have the hat and gloves on for, then?\" And the guy says, \"Well, you never know.\" \nCato bursts into laughter. \nKIT Isn't that funny? \nCato stops laughing. He wants to give Kit the right answer. \nCATO Yeah, I guess. \nKIT (o.c.) She plays the clarinet, too. \nHolly smiles politely. \nHOLLY Don't you ever get bored around here? \nCATO Sometimes. The other day, though, an old boy was plowing in the field over there, found some old Spanish coins. \nKIT (suspicious) That's what he told you, huh? \nCATO (o.c.) No, he showed me one. \nHOLLY What'd they look like? \nCATO (o.c.) Kind of round, like so... Gold. I'll show you if you want. \nKit and Holly eye one another.

Kit turns to him. \nKIT Say, what kind of rifle was that you were shooting at me? \nDEPUTY Thirty aught six. \nKIT (o.c.) You ever had to open it up like that before? \nDEPUTY Nope. \nKit turns back around. \nKIT (reassuringly) Well, you boys have performed like a couple of heroes... And don't think I'm not going to pass it around when we get to town. \nThe Sheriff lifts the hat off Kit's head and tosses it out the window.

Kit, I've got a question for you. \nKIT Mmmmm. \nDEPUTY You like people? \nKIT They're okay. \nDEPUTY Then why'd you do it? \nKIT I don't know. Always wanted to be a criminal, I guess.

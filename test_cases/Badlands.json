{"train": "KIT Listen, Holly. you want to take a walk with me? \nHOLLY What for? \nKIT Well. I got some stuff to say. Guess I'm kind of lucky that way. Most people don't have anything on their minds, do they? \nHolly eyes him suspiciously. \nEXT. STREET \nThey walk down the middle of the street. Holly has accepted his offer. \nKIT Oh, incidentally, my last name is Carruthers. Sounds a little too much like \u0093druthers,\u0094 doesn't it? \nHOLLY It's okay. \nKIT Well, nobody asked me what I thought. They just hung it on me. \nHolly breaks the silence that follows. \nHOLLY You still in school? \nKIT Nah, I got me a job. \nHOLLY (o.c.) Doing what? \nKIT Well, I don't mind getting up early, so I got a job throwing garbage... I'm not in love with the stuff, okay. \nIn the distance we hear Holly's FATHER calling her. She eases off. \nHOLLY That's my father. I got to run. \nKIT Hey. wait a minute. When am I going to see you again? \nHolly isn't sure how to reply. \nHOLLY Well, I know what my daddy's going to say. \nKIT (o.c.) What? \nHOLLY Can I be honest? \nKIT Sure. \nHOLLY Well, that I shouldn't be seen with anybody that collects garbage. \nKIT (o.c.) He'll say that? \nHOLLY Yeah. \nKIT (o.c.) Now what's he know about garbage, huh? \nThe Clerk gives him a slip of paper. \nEXT. FRONT PORCH OF HOLLY'S HOUSE \nHolly sees Kit approaching the house. \nHOLLY (v.o.) He was handsomer than anybody I'd ever met. He looked just like James Dean. \nShe walks out the front door. \nKIT Hi. \nHOLLY Well, stop the world. \nKIT Quit my job. \nHOLLY Great. \nKIT Just seemed like the right move... Whatcha doing? \nHOLLY Spanish. \nKIT (o.c.) How do you say \"Quit my Job\" in Spanish? \nHOLLY Something mi trabajo. \nKit offers her a cigarette, which she declines. \nKIT Yeah, well, I'm going to work as a cowboy now... Or thinking about it. It's a routine, like anything. What do you think? \nHOLLY I don't know. \nHe pulls himself up onto the bannister beside her. \nKIT Well, at least nobody could get on me about wearing these boots any more. \nShe watches him intently. This makes him uncomfortable. \nKIT You want to go for a ride? \nHOLLY Well, I got homework. \nKIT (o.c.) Bring it along. \nHis forwardness surprises her. \nEXT. DOWNTOWN STREET IN FT. DUPREE \nThey are walking through the downtown area. Kit kicks a paper bag that someone has discarded on the sidewalk. \nKIT Somebody dropped a bag on the sidewalk. \nHOLLY (v.o.) Of course I had to keep all this a secret from my dad. He would've had a fit, since Kit was ten years older than me and came from the wrong side of the tracks, so called. Our time with each other was limited and each lived for the precious hours when he or she could be with the other away from all the cares of the world. \nEXT. UNDERNEATH BLEACHERS \nKit and Holly are necking underneath some bleachers. In the distance we hear the NOISE of the football practice. \nHOLLY My stomach's growling. \nKIT There's an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it? \nHOLLY No. \nKit laughs, and starts her laughing, too. \nKIT Somebody else is going to get it. \nHOLLY I don't care. \nKIT Kids eat that kind of stuff in Korea. \nAt this her expression turns serious. \nSERIES OF ANGLES \nKit in CLOSEUP at a fence in the feedlot, an intense look on his face. \nVARIOUS ANGLES of the cattle in their pens. They look numb and morose. \nTIGHT SHOT of Holly necking with Kit. \nHOLLY (v.o.) In the stench and slime of the feedlot, he'd remember how I looked the night before, how I ran my hand through his hair and traced the outline of his lips with my fingertip. He wanted to die with me, and I dreamed of being lost forever in his arms. \nEXT. HOLLY'S BACK YARD \nTIGHT SHOT of Holly's pet catfish in a bowl. \nCUT TO WIDE SHOT of Holly with gloves on carrying the fish through the garden in back of her house. She looks around warily, then throws it out among the melons. \nHOLLY (v.o.) The whole time, the only thing I did wrong was throwing out my fish when he got sick. Later I got a new one, but this incident kept on bothering me and I turned to Kit. \nEXT. STREET \nKit and Holly walk down a sidewalk in the residential part of town. Kit is consoling her about the fish. \nHOLLY (v.o.) I didn't mind telling Kit about stuff like this, cause strange things happened in his life, too, and some of the stuff he did was strange. \nEXT. FEEDLOT \nKit steps on top of a dead cow, as though to convince himself that it is dead. \nHOLLY (v.o.) For instance,. he faked his signature whenever he used it, to keep other people from forging important papers with his name... \nShe gives him a cold look. \nHOLLY Don't call me stupid. \nKIT Okay, but I'm going to keep it for a souvenir... \nHe throws it awav and picks up a smaller one. \nKIT Or maybe one that's lighter. \nHe walks over to the car. A bridge is visible in the distance. \nEXT. FIELD \nKit releases a large red balloon into the evening sky. A small basket is fixed to the bottom of the balloon. \nHOLLY (v.o.) Kit made a solemn vow that he would always stand beside me and let nothing come between us. He wrote this out in writing, put the paper in a box with some of our little tokens and things, then sent it off in a balloon he'd found while on the garbage route. (pause) His heart was filled with longing as he watched it drift off. Something must've told him that we'd never live these days of happiness again, that they were gone forever. \nDISSOLVE TO \nEXT. CATTAILS \nHolly's dog bounds through a stand of cattails. Holly speaks angrily to her father, who walks toward the dog with a gun. We do not hear their voices, only music. He shoots the dog and Holly runs off in horror. \nHOLLY (v.o.) Then, sure enough, Dad found out I'd been running around behind his back. He was madder than I'd ever seen him. As punishment for deceiving him, he went and shot my dog. \nEXT. BRIDGE \nHolly's father drags a duffel bag out of his truck and dumps it over the side of a bridge, into a river. It goes under briefly, then bobs to the surface. The current takes it off. \nDISSOLVE TO \nEXT. MUSIC SCHOOL \nHolly sits in the second-story window of a music school. \nHOLLY (v.o.) He made me take extra music lessons every day after school and wait there till he came to pick me up. He said that if the piano didn't keep me off the streets. maybe the clarinet would. \nDISSOLVE TO \nEXT. BILLBOARD \nKit approaches Holly's father, who is hard at work, painting a billboard along a deserted stretch of road. Kit is eating a peach. \nKIT Sure is pretty. \nFATHER What'd you come out here for? \nKIT I wasn't aware there was any law against it. \nKit sees that this kind of talk will not do. He is silent for a moment, then throws the peach away. \nKit draws the pistol. He is shaken, though he must have seen this coming. \nFATHER What do you think you're doing? Go on, get out of here. \nKIT Well, I got it all planned... and I'm taking Holly off with me. \nHe looks at Holly, who has appeared on the landing, uncertain what her reaction to all this will be. \nFATHER Okay, boy, I'm turning you over to the authorities. \nKit steps forward as Holly's father starts down the stairs. \nKIT What for? \nFATHER For coming onto my property... With a gun. \nKIT No, you're not either. \nFATHER (o.c.) Yeah? Why not? \nKIT Cause I can't allow it. \nHolly's father stares at him for a moment, then continues down the stairs. Kit starts forward. \nKIT Hey... Hey, wait a minute. \nHis shout arrests Holly's father at the bottom of the stairs. \nKIT Suppose I shot you. How'd that be? Huh? \nHolly's father does not move. \nKIT You want to hear what it sounds like? \nHe fires a shot into the stairs. The report is deafening in the enclosure of the stairwell. They exchange looks. Kit's breathing is heavy. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nHolly's father turns and walks into the living room. Kit rushes down the stairs. Holly shouts his name. \nKIT Hey, where you going? \nHe fires two shots into Holly's father, who slowly sinks to the floor. Kit unlimbers his shoulder. Holly rushes down the stairs to her father's side. \nHOLLY Daddy... This is Holly... Are you going to be okay? \nHer father does not respond. She looks back at Kit, who avoids her gaze. She gets to her feet and walks nto the kitchen. Kit follows her. \nINT. KITCHEN \nKit closes the back door to the house. \nHOLLY Listen, maybe we ought to tell somebody about this. \nKIT You said that once already... Too late now. \nHOLLY Why? \nKIT They're not going to listen to me. You either. Are you kidding? \nA silence follows. \nHOLLY Suppose the neighbors heard the noise? \nKIT Wouldn't be funny... Listen, I'll be back in a while. \nHe gets up and heads for the front door. \nKIT Oh... You want to call the police, that's fine. Just won't be so hot for me. \nThere are tears in Holly's eyes now. They exchange looks as Kit opens the front door. Then he leaves. Holly settles back on the couch. \nEXT. HOLLY'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe house by night. \nINT. HALLWAY AND BEDROOM - NIGHT \nHolly comes up the stairs, smoking a cigarette. She walks to her bedroom window. The CAMERA DOLLIES with her. Outside, under the street lamp, she can see two boys trading secrets. \nINT. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT \nKit puts fifty cents into a gramophone booth. He clears his voice as the machine whirs Into operation. \nKIT My girl Holly and I have decided to kill ourselves, same way I did her dad. Big decision huh? Well, the reasons are obvious, and I don't have time to go into them right now... One thing, though... He was provoking me when I popped him. That's what it was like, a POP. \nInserts of the booth's mechanism a light panel measuring off the seconds and the needle on the record. \nKIT Course nobody's coming out of this thing happy, especially not us. You can't deny we've had fun, though. Which is more than I can say for some.... Mmmm. that's the end of the message. I run out of things to say... Thank you. \nHe gets these last words in just as his time is up. He gets the record and steps outside the booth, into the lobby of a train station. \nDISSOLVE TO \nINT. HOLLY'S LIVING ROOM - SERIES OF ANGLES - NIGHT \nKit slams a ten-gallon can of gasoline down on the piano bench, opens it and begins pouring it out over the interior of the house, kicking aside everything that comes in his way. \nEXT. REAR OF HOUSE - NIGHT \nHolly comes out the screen door at the back of the house, carrying a suitcase and a painting. Kit appears with a lamp on an extension cord. He sets it down beside a victrola he has set up on a table outdoors. He puts the needle on the record he recorded earlier. Holly watches him as she retreats to the car. \nHOLLY (v.o.) Kit left a record playing over and over for the District Attorney to find. He was gambling for time. \nThe CAMERA PANS off Holly's painting, a Maxwell Parrish, onto Kit asleep with his pistol beside him. then onto Holly under a quilt with a box of shells beside her. Her hand quivers once. \nEXT. TREE TOPS \nKit lifts an egg out of a bird's nest at the top of a tree. He drops it down to Holly, fifty feet below. \nHOLLY (v.o.) They hadn't found but one set of bones in the ashes of the house. so we knew they'd be looking for us. Kit made sure we'd be prepared. \nEXT. TRAIL - SERIES OF ANGLES \nKit cuts a piece of twine that lies across a trail, whereupon a ball full of spikes comes swinging down out of the trees. with lethal force. Kit ducks out of the way. We next see Kit with a dew ag around his forehead, running laps through the woods as part of his training. He exhorts himself to greater effort. \nHOLLY (v.o.) He gave me lectures on how a gun works, how to take it apart and put it back together again. in case 1 had to carry on without him. He said that if the Devil came at me, I could shoot him with a gun. \nEXT. TAMARISK \nHolly struggles through the undergrowth witha yoke over her shoulders, carrying wood back to the teahouse. \nHOLLY (v.o.) One day, I carried thirty pounds of wood a distance of five miles. Another day, while hiding in the forest, I covered my eyes with makeup, to see how they'd come out. \nTIGHT ON HOLLY'S EYES \nHolly has made her eyes up with mascara. \nEXT. FRONT OF TREEHOUSE \nKit and Holly dance the stroll to the sound of Mickey and Sylvia on their Zenith portable. Holly shows a better sense of rhythm than Kit. \nEXT. MUD FLAT BESIDE RIVER - DUSK \nKit lifts a fish out of the river with a crude device like a lacrosse net. Holly sits on the bank In the b.g. The fish wriggles out of the net and falls back In the water. Kit struggles in vain to retrieve it. \nHOLLY (v.o.) We had our bad moments, like any couple. Kit accused me of only being along for the ride,while at times I wished he'd fall in the river and drown, so I could watch. \nKit throws his net down in disgust, partly at Holly. \nKIT Take a break. Red... Life of Riley, huh? \nHolly ignores him as he walks off down the flat. \nHOLLY (v.o.) Mostly. though. we got along fine and stayed in love. \nEXT. FRONT OF TREEHOUSE \nHolly, in curlers, walks over to where Kit is shaving. \nHOLLY One of the chickens died last night. \nShe pats a little water on her face, dries it with a burlap towel, picks up a hatchet and walks off into the forest to cut the morning's firewood. \nHOLLY I almost stepped on him. \nHolly is off somewhere in the forest. putting on lipstick. Kit sits on watch in the crowls nest, a pair of binoculars close at hand. On sound, over the music, we hear voices whispering to them. Kit sees a movement in the brush. A moment later a figure appears, a hunter, carrying a gun. Kit shouts a code word to Holly. She takes off running, as Kit clambers down the planks of the treehouse and collects his shotgun. He tells her to hide, runs through the woods and dives in a hole, under a cover of leaves. She jumps behind a log. Several shots of the still forest follow, then the hunters appear, a shoulder here. pant leg there. The music ends as one of them cocks his gun. They pass right over the hole where Kit is hiding. Kit rises up slowly, gives them a gentlemanly word of warning, then shoots all three in the back. He checks to see if anybody else is with them, then calls weakly out to Holly. \nKIT Holly! \nHolly picks her way through the brush, back to the treehouse. \nEXT. TREEHOUSE \nThey are packed up and ready to leave. Kit slams the trunk of the Mercury. \nKIT Get in the car, Red. \nHe takes a bird cage off the roof of the car and throws it away. \nKIT We don't need this. \nHe climbs a ladder, looks In the cabin of the treehouse to see if they've left anything behind, then jumps down. He flips over the wicker hemisphere that covers their rooster. The rooster walks off, free. He surveys the woods, then looks back at Holly, who returns his look and gets in the car. \nHOLLY (v.o.)Kit felt bad about shooting those men in the backs. but he said they'd come in like that. and they would've played it as down and dirty as they could, and besides, held overheard them whispering about how they were only interested in the reward money. With lawmen it wouldtve been different. They were out there to get a job done and they deserved a fair chance. But not a bounty hunter. \nEXT. BADLANDS - SERIES OF ANGLES \nWe see a flat expanse of the Badlands. The Mercury appears over the horizon and heads toward a solitary house. A man appears at the door of the house, Kit's friend, Cato. \nHOLLY (v.o.) We went to hide out with a friend of Kit's from the days of the garbage route. \nEXT. CATO'S HOUSE. \nKit gets out of the car, takes a chicken from the back seat and walks over to face Cato. He keeps a safe distance. \nKIT How you doing, Cato? \nCATO Not bad. \nKit steps forward, rifle in hand, and offers Cato the chicken. \nKIT Take that sombitch. \nCato takes it, a wan smile on his face. \nKIT What you been doing? \nCATO Running this place for a fella in town. Nothing much to speak of. \nKIT Well, I don't notice us hustling trash, either. \nKit walks over to inspect the interior of Cato's house. \nKIT Where'd you get them antlers? \nCATO (o.c.) They come with the house. \nKIT Okay. \nCATO I'll catch up with you. \nKIT Okay. \nKit walks out into the field to join Holly. Cato turns back. \nHOLLY I found a lid. It was laying on the ground over there. \nKIT Put that down. It's dirty. \nHolly tosses the lid at him. He picks up some dirt clods and starts throwing them at her. She squeals and dodges. CATO watches them for a while, indecisive, then turns and runs. \nHOLLY (o.c.) Hey, you're throwing big ones! \nSuddenly, Kit spots Cato. \nKIT Cato! \nCato jumps over a trough and comes to a stop in front of his truck, a water tanker. \nCATO The shovel's in the truck. \nKit raises his gun and shoots Cato through the belly. CATO falls, then gets to his feet and stumbles toward the front door of the house. Kit follows him for a while, then skips forward and opens the door for him. \nINT. BEDROOM \nCato falls on his bed and rolls over to face Kit. Kit walks in calmly and picks up a photo on the bureau. \nHOLLY (v.o.) Kit never let on why he'd shot Cato. He said that just talking about it could bring us bad luck and that right now we needed all the luck we could get. \nKit sets the photo down. \nKIT (o.c.) You never told me about her. \nHe looks under the bed, then walks out the door. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nHolly stands near a window. smoking a cigarette. Kit sets his rifle down and surveys the room, which is cluttered with odds and ends. \nKIT Look at all this junk. \nHOLLY How's he doing? \nKIT (shrugging) I got him in the stomach. \nHolly sits down. \nHOLLY Is he upset? \nKIT He said not to tell. \nBOY (o.c.) Oh yeah? \nKIT Yeah, he said for you to give us a lift into town. You're the ones with the Studebaker, aren't you? \nThe Boy hesitates a second, then starts for the house. \nBOY Well, I just need to pick up something in the house. \nKit draws his gun. \nKIT No... You go in there, I'll have to kill you. \nBOY What's going on? \nKIT Can't afford to take chances. \nThe Girl is baffled. \nKIT (o.c.) Come on out of there, young lady. \nKit waves them out into the neighboring field with him. \nKIT Let's us step out in this field here. \nThe Boy raises his hands. \nKIT Nah, skip that... I'm going to have to keep an eye on you, though. \nBOY Okay. \nKIT You don't mind? \nHolly steps out the front door and smiles at the girl. \nHOLLY Hi. \nEXT. FIELD \nHolly and the girl walk through the field toward a storm cellar where the boys are waiting for them. The wind is blowing hard. \nGIRL What's going to happen to Jack and me? \nHOLLY You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump. \nGIRL Okay. \nHOLLY What's your friend's name? \nGIRL Jack. \nKit, rifle in hand, lumbers out a side door of the house with Cato over his shoulder. He steers for a nearby box car that evidently served Cato as a shed. \nHOLLY (v.o.) Kit was the most trigger happy person I'd ever met. He claimed that as long as you're playing for keeps and the law is coming at you, it's considered okay to shoot all witnesses. You had to take the consequences, though, and not whine about it later. \nKit opens the doors of the box car. and dumps Cato inside. Before closing the doors he checks Cato's shoes. to see if they are the ones he gave him. Holly looks on from the side of the house, twenty yards away. \nHOLLY We're in for it now... If they catch us. \nKit looks cornered and defensive. Holly thinks for a moment. \nHOLLY What'd you put him in there for? \nKIT (shrugging) Just to keep him out of the sun. \nKit heads out of sight around the rear of the box car. Holly goes back inside. Kit walks up and down the length of the box car, talking under his breath and throwing his rifle from hand to hand, in a state. \nDISSOLVE TO \nEXT. COUNTRY ROAD \nKit and Holly travel down a country road in the Studebaker. \nHOLLY (v.o.) At this moment I didn't feel shame or fear, but just kind of blah, like when you're sitting there and all the water's run out of the bathtub. \nINT. CAR \nKit, driving, turns to Holly. \nKIT You tired? \nHOLLY Yeah. \nKIT Yeah, you look tired... Listen, honey. when all this is over, I'm going to sit down and buy you a big, thick steak. \nHOLLY I don't want a steak. \nKIT Well, we'll see about that... Hey, lookie. \nHe nods at a wrecked car lying in a ditch beside the road. \nKIT They're probably going to blame that on me, too, bastards. \nVIGILANTE MONTAGE - SERIES OF ANGLES - BLACK AND WHITE \nVarious shots characterizing the Midwest's reaction to Kit and Holly a deserted street, law officers posing with their guns and ammunition, children walking from class under armed guard, a detective in a trench coat pointing at a pump, a woman calling in her children at dusk, a county official posing with the county records, the court reporter with a book of signatures, vigilantes signing up and being deputized, then riding through the streets of their town in the backs of pickups, a priest among them, etc. \nHOLLY (v.o.) The whole country was out looking for us, for who knew where Kit would strike next? Sidewalks were deserted. Stores closed their doors and drew their blinds. Posses and vigilante committees were set up from Texas to North Dakota. Children rode back and forth to school under heavy guard. A famous detective was brought in from Boston. He could find no clues ... My clarinet teacher said I probably wasn't responsible, but others said I was. Then, on Thursday, the Governor of Oklahoma sent out the National Guard to stand watch at the Federal Reserve Bank in Tulsa when word got out that Kit meant to rob it... It was like the Russians had invaded. \nEXT. RICH MAN'S HOUSE \nKit and Holly approach a large Victorian mansion. Kit rings the bell. \nHolly, in the next angle, has moved a bust off its pedestal onto the corner of a piano. She thinks better of this and restores the bust to its original position. \nKit sniffs at a glass of sherry, then takes a picture off the mantel and studies it. \nHolly, at the other end of the room. tests the comforts of a chair. This done. she moves to another chair and tests it, too. She makes her hand limp. She watches it swing back and forth. \nKit sits in the chair which the Rich Man occupied earlier. He has a thoughtful look on his face. There is a dictaphone on the table beside him. \nINT. HALLWAY \nHolly takes a cane out of the umbrella rack, looks around furtively, then steps out a side door of the house. \nEXT. LAWN \nHolly walks down the slope of the lawn. \nHOLLY (v.o.) I left Kit in the parlor and went for a stroll outside the house. The day was quiet and serene, but I didn't notice, for I was deep in thought, and not even thinking about how to slip off. \nAcross the way she can see a long driveway, with a border of lush greenery and a sleepy cat standing in the sun. \nHOLLY (v.o.) The world was like a faraway planet to which I could never return... I thought what a fine place it was, full of things for people to look into and enjoy. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - TIGHT ON KIT \nKit talks into the dictaphone, recording some advice for young people. \nKIT Listen to your parents and teachers. They got a line on most things, so don't treat them like enemies. There's always a chance you could learn something. (he pauses for a moment) Try to keep an open mind. Try to understand the viewpoint of others. Consider the minority opinion, but try to get along with the majority opinion once it's accepted. (again he pauses) Course Holly and I've had fun, even if it has been rushed, and... so far we're doing fine. hadn't got caught. (annoyed) Excuse the grammar. \nHe sets down the dictaphone. puts out his cigarette and leans back in his chair, lost in reflection. \nINT. COVERED ROOM \nHolly enters the room where the Rich Man and his Maid have been put. The furniture and paintings are covered with sheets, suggesting that for some purpose, known only to the family, the room has been set aside. \nHOLLY Hi... Kit's downstairs playing with the dictaphone... Sometimes he acts like there's something wrong with his bean. \nShe leans against the window. behind the couch where the Rich Man is sitting. \nHOLLY Hope nothing ever goes wrong with mine. \nRICH MAN Think he's crazy, huh? \nHOLLY I don't know... He's kind of odd. \nShe sits down beside the Rich Man. \nHOLLY (shyly) They claim I've got him wrapped around my little finger, but I never told him to shoot anybody. \nShe looks the room over. \nHOLLY Gosh, I like your house. \nKIT Hi, whatcha doing? \nRICH MAN Just thinking. \nKIT Good a way to kill time as any... She okay? \nHe points to the Maid with his pistol. \nRICH MAN Yes. \nKIT Listen, ah ... We're going to take the Cadillac for a while. How'd that be? \nRICH MAN Fine. \nKIT Don't worry, I won't let her drive. \nHe means Holly. \nKIT (continuing) Oh, and here's a list of everything we borrowed. Car's on there, too. \nHe gives the list to the Rich Man and signals the Maid to accompany them out. \nKIT Okay, ma'am, let's go . . . come on. \nINT. HALLWAY \nKit points the Rich Man and his Maid into a closet. \nKIT You're my friend, aren't you? \nRICH MAN Yes. \nKIT Okay, no monkey business then. \nHe locks the door of the closet once they are inside, starts off, then remembers something, takes a handkerchief out of his pocket and wipes his fingerprints off the door handle. \nKIT Groceries. \nWith this reminder he collects his bag of groceries and heads down the hall. \nEXT. FRONT PORCH \nKit and Holly come out the front door. Holly wears a shawl over her head as a disguise, Kit wears the outfit he took off the Rich Man's coat rack. He carries his groceries, rifle and a silver trophy he stole from somewhere in the house. \nKIT That guy could sell that list I gave him as a sample of my handwriting. \nHolly starts off, \nKIT (continuing) Hey, why're you always walking ahead of me? \nHOLLY Well, why you always walking behind me? \nEXT. RAIL TRESTLE \nKit and Holly have parked the Cadillac under a rail trestle. A train is approaching. They hide beside the car. The train, a streamliner, roars overhead. When it has passed, Holly rushes up the grade to watch it disappear into the distance. Kit watches from the opposite end of the trestle. \nKIT Maybe we should've tried to hop it. \nHOLLY It was going too fast. \nKIT I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some. \nHOLLY (o.c.) Yeah, then we'd be stuck here. \nKIT Well, maybe we oughta be stuck here. I'm not saying that I know. \nHe stoops down and picks up a Pepsi bottle. \nHOLLY You're crazy. \nHe climbs over the edge of the trestle, looks back at her oddly, then leaps down to the ground. Holly walks down to meet him. \nHOLLY (v.o.) Kit took the bottle and spun it around, leaving to fate which direction we should take. \nTIGHT ON BOTTLE \nKit spins the bottle. \nEXT. BOTTOM OF TRESTLE \nThe bottle comes to a stop. Kit inspects its position. He does not appear satisfied, though. \nKIT Well, maybe the slope here is throwing it off some. We ought to find a more flat place. \nHOLLY How about over here? \nKit starts toward her, then changes his mind and heads back up the grade, to the tracks. The CAMERA DOLLIES and CRANES with him. \nKIT Never mind. It doesn't matter... If I'm worth a damn, I'll pick the right direction. And if I'm not, well, I don't care. See what I mean? \nHOLLY (o.c.) No. \nKIT Well, I shouldn't expect miracles, should I? \nHe stops at the top of the grade and looks out across the Badlands. \nKIT We'll keep on heading for that mountain... Just remember I said it wasn't such a hot idea. \nDISSOLVE TO \nEXT. TRESTLE - DUSK \nThe Cadillac pulls out from under the trestle and heads down a dusty road alongside the tracks. \nKIT You smoke Pall Mall? \nHOLLY Yeah. \nHe is surprised to discover this. \nKIT Nah, you hadn't seen me when I'm going after something, honey. Tough? \nHe cocks his head just thinking about it. She reaches for the radio to change the station. He pats her hand away. \nKIT Hey. don't touch that... Nat King Cole. \nEXT. BADLANDS - NIGHT \nThey dance in the headlights to the tune of \"A Blossom Fell\" coming over the car radio. She is wearing the rich man's jacket. After a moment Kit whispers in her ear. \nKIT Boy, if I could sing a song like that... I mean, if I could sing a song about the way I feel right now, it'd be a hit. \nThey continue dancing. \nEXT. CADILLAC ON PLAINS - DAY \nTwo shots of the Cadillac heading across the Badlands at dawn. \nHOLLY (v.o.) Kit knew the end was coming. He wondered if he'd hear the doctor pronounce him dead, or if he'd be able to read what the papers would say about him,the next day, from the other side. He dreaded the iea of being shot down alone, he said, without a girl to scream out his name. \nINT. CADILLAC - DAWN \nHolly yawns with fatigue. \nHOLLY (v.o.) Then, for an instant, the sight of the mountains in the dawn light got his hopes back up. \nKit shakes his head with admiration and wonder. \nKIT God, what a sight... Tell me this, honey. What does a little Texas girl like yourself think of a sight like that? \nShe turns to look at the mountains. \nEXT.

He stares at her for a moment, then bows his head and walks off a distance. \nKIT What is wrong with you, huh? \nHe kicks wildly at dust. \nKIT What is the matter with you, huh!? \nMeanwhile, the helicopter continues its approach. Kit walks in closer to Holly. \nKIT Boy, I don't know what to make of you. People like you. \nHe kicks at the rigs then turns back to face her. \nKIT You want a second chance, then listen. Twelve noon the Grand Coulee Dam, New Year'ss Day. 1964. You meet me there... Now you got that? \nShe nods, bewildered. The helicopter is landing. He grabs a discarded fender off the truck, hangs it over his arm like a shield and runs to the Cadillac, exchanging shots with a State Trooper who has arrived in the helicopter. The Trooper is hit and falls. Kit jumps in the car and roars off. Holly surrenders herself to the pilot of the helicopter and is taken off. \nEXT. GAS STATION \nKit pulls into a gas station. He gets out of his car and drums on the roof. \nKIT Hey, anybody here? \nAn ATTENDANT walks out the door. \nKIT Hi... Say,, you got any shells for a Savage, a .300 Savage? \nATTENDANT Nope. \nKIT Damn. I pissed all mine away shooting up bottles... You want to fill her up for me? Please? \nThe Attendant nods. Kit pulls Holly's suitcase out of the back seat and walks over to a trash can at the edge of the apron. Kit throws Holly's things methodically into the trash can. After a while he comes upon a book. He opens the book and looks through it, then turns to find the Attendant staring at him. As he gets to his feet. he nods at the trash can. \nKIT If you want any of that junk, it's yours. \nMeanwhile, a police car approaches the station. Kit sees it at about the same time the police see him. He throws his book in the car and roars out of the station.

He and Holly exchange looks. \nKIT Don't worry now.. I'm going to get you off these charges... There's a whole lot of other boys out there. You're going to have a lot of fun. \nHolly looks down. \nKIT Boy, we rang the bells, didn't we? \nHolly does not reply. \nKIT I'll say one thing, though... That guy with the deaf maid?

My father had kept their wedding cake in the freezer for ten whole years. After the funeral he gave it to the yardman... He tried to act cheerful, but he could never be consoled by the little stranger he found in his house. Then, one day, hoping to begin a new life away from the scene of all his memories, he moved us from Texas to Ft. Dupree, South Dakota. \nHOLD on FULL SHOT of bedroom. \nDISSOLVE TO \nEXT.

He inspects it briefly. then looks back at his friend and co-worker, CATO, a stocky man in his forties. \nKIT I'll give you a dollar to eat this collie. \nCato inspects the dog. \nCATO I'm not going to eat him for a dollar... I don't think he's a collie, either. Some kind of dog. \nThey drive off. \nKIT Watch your heads. \nNEW ANGLE \nThe truck comes to a stop. Kit bangs on the driver's door. \nKIT Hey. Woody. Gimme a cigarette. \nWOODY waves him off. Kit shrugs to Cato. \nKIT Woody wouldn't give me a cigarette. (pause) Ever notice he don't talk much? \nCato agrees with this.

This lady don't ever pay her bills. She's gonna get in trouble if she doesn't watch out. \nCato, ignoring him, picks up a magazine that is lying in the grass. When the CAMERA returns to Kit, he has stripped off his apron. \nKIT I throwed enough trash for today, Cato.... I'll see you In the morning. \nHe slaps Cato on the back and walks off. Cato throws a mouldy loaf of bread at his back. \nCATO Catch! \nKIT What do you mean? \nHe throws the loaf back at Cato. \nEXT.

He crosses the street and introduces himself. \nEXT. FRONT LAWN \nKIT Hi, I'm Kit. I'm not keeping you from anything important, am I? \nHOLLY No. \nKIT Well, I was just messing around over there, thought I'd come over and say hello to you. (smiling) I'll try anything once.

MOUNTAIN \nHeat waves rise off the land. A mountain is barely discernible in the distance. \nDISSOLVE TO \nEXT. BADLANDS \nThe Cadillac races through a herd of cows, \nHOLLY (v.o.)

PIPELINE WAYSTATION \nThe Cadillac is stopped beside a pipeline waystation. Kit has tapped some gas off the head. \nHOLLY (v.o.)

BADLANDS \nThe Cadillac roars through a stand of mesquite and disappears into the distance. \nHOLLY (v.o.) Little by little we approached the border.

Kit takes all this in, then he turns back to the campsite. The sun is down, just barely, and the moon has risen behind him. Holly is heard over this last shot. \nHOLLY (v.o.) We lived in utter loneliness, neither here nor there. Kit said that solitude was a better word, cause it meant more exactly what I wanted to say. Whatever the expression, I told him we couldn't go on living this way. \nINT. CADILLAC \nKit and Holly sit in the back seat of the Cadillac. They have been necking. Her hair is in curlers. \nKIT (responding to v.o.) Why not? I mean, I'm having fun... At least I'm not bitching. \nHOLLY Well, I feel kind of like an animal living out here.

KIT - WITH FOOTBALL \nKit sets a football down on the ground, backs off a few steps, squats and shoots a hole through it with his pistol. To his surprise. it does not deflate.

Afterwards he took and buried some of our things in a bucket. He said that nobody else would know where we'd put them, and that we'd come back someday, maybe, and they'd still be sitting here, just the same, but we'd be different. And if we never got back, well, somebody might dig them up a thousand years from now and wouldn't they wonder! \nEXT. BADLANDS \nThe Cadillac speeds across the plains.

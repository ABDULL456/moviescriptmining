WILL TURNER So I'm to understand what *you* did was an act of compassion? 
FLYING DUTCHMAN below deck 
[Bootstrap and Will enter the interior of the ship together] 
[crewmember Wyvern is seen to their right, encrusted into the interior side of the hull, standing up] 
WILL TURNER I've sworn no oath. 
WILL TURNER Not until I find this. The key. 
[Wyvern's eyes open in the coral-encrusted wall at the mention of the key] 
[Wyvern, who is part of the wall, breaks his head away from the wall, leaving his brains behind] 
WYVERN The deadman's chest. 
WILL TURNER What do you know of this? 
WYVERN Open the chest with the key, and stab the heart. No-no-no-no. Don't stab the heart. The Dutchman needs a living heart, or there'll be no captain. And if there's no captain, there's no one to have the key. 
WILL TURNER So the captain has the key. 
[Wyvern retracts his head back into the wall, having said too much] 
WILL TURNER Where *is* the key? 
WYVERN Hidden. 
WILL TURNER Where is the chest? 
WYVERN Hidden. 
[Wyvern closes his eyes, and falls silent] 
Black Pearl 
[the Black Pearl is at a dock, loading fruits and livestock] 
[Jack and Gibbs are walking together, Elizabeth approaches from behind, still dressed as a man] 
ELIZABETH SWANN Captain Sparrow! 
JACK SPARROW Come to join me crew, lad? Welcome aboard. 
ELIZABETH SWANN I'm here to find the man I love. 
JACK SPARROW I'm deeply flattered, son, but my first and only love is the sea. 
[Norrington vomits over the side] 
ELIZABETH SWANN Meaning William Turner, Captain Sparrow. 
JACK SPARROW Elizabeth.  Hide the rum. 
[Gibbs takes the bottle that Jack hands to him, and walks up the boarding plank in the background] 
JACK SPARROW You know, these clothes do not flatter you at all. It should be a dress or nothing. I happen to have no dress in my cabin. 
ELIZABETH SWANN Jack. I know Will came to find you. Where is he? 
JACK SPARROW Darling, I am truly unhappy to have to tell you this but... through an unfortunate and *entirely* unforeseeable series of circumstances that have nothing whatsoever to do with me, poor William has been press-ganged into Davy Jones' crew. 
ELIZABETH SWANN Davy Jones? 
[Norrington vomits over the side, then spits] 
NORRINGTON Oh, please. The captain of the Flying Dutchman. 
JACK SPARROW You look bloody awful. What are you doing here? 
NORRINGTON You *hired* me. I can't help it if your standards are lax. 
JACK SPARROW You *smell* funny.

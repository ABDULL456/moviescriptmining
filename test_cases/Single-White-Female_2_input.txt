BATHROOM - INTERIOR 
We don't know if it's day or night. We see a little girl, aged around eight, putting lipstick on her lips. She is wearing earrings and a ring on the middle finger of her right hand. She moves forward and we see another girl about the same age. The first girl puts lipstick on the lips of the second girl. Both girl are smiling. 
More credits, still without capital letters. 
The camera moves back and we get a better view of the second girl. The two girls appear to be twins. The first girl takes a powder puff and puts powder on the second girl's cheeks. 
The two girls look at themselves in the mirror. The camera gives the impression to be located behind the mirror. 
The first girl gives a kiss on the cheek of the second girl. 
FADE OUT TO BLACK SCREEN 
The title of the film appears on the black screen. 
The camera moves and we see, appearing on the right-hand side of the screen : 
BUILDING - EXTERIOR NIGHT 
This building is actually Allison's building, but we don't know it yet. 
Credits resume on the screen. 
The camera keeps on moving and we see several lit windows. The building itself is a nice building with carvings on the walls. 
The camera moves backward, giving us a full view of the building. 
As the camera comes back forward, we hear two voices speaking, one male, one female. They are the voices of Allison «Allie» Jones and her fiancé Sam Rawson. 
SAM (voice over) So how many kids do we want ? 
ALLISON (voice over) I dunno. What's the statistical norm ? 
SAM (voice over) You and your statistics. 
Allison laughs 
SAM (voice over) One point two. 
ALLISON (voice over) Okay, then I want two point two. 
Fade to : 
ALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Sam and Allison are lying on the bed, partly dressed. Sam is holding Allison next to him. They are both about thirty years old. Allison has short red hair, and Sam has brown wavy hair. 
Behind the front of the bed we see the wrought iron of the balcony. The light is very dim in the room, lit only by the street lights and a couple of candles. We hear Allison finishing her last voice over sentence. 
ALLISON And I want them to look like you. 
SAM Poor kids. 
End of credits. 
SAM So, if I got to be able to drag you away from computer tomorrow, I'll buy you that ring. 
ALLISON Sure. So, is this gonna be a real wedding ? 
She moves a bit away from him, and takes a piece of grapes in a plate lying on the floor. SAM As opposed to a fake one ? 
ALLISON You know what I mean, Sam. You've already been through the big ceremony with too hundred people. 
SAM That was the fake one. This is the real one. You can have any kind of wedding you want. Underwater. In and out of a steam room in the wild. Horseback. 
Allison goes back into Sam's arms.

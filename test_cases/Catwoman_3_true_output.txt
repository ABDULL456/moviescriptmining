INT. PATIENCE'S BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT 
PATIENCE moves to her apartment door, arms loaded with GROCERIES. She struggles to unlock the door while keeping these upright -- we see a "HELLO KITTY" emblem on her key chain. As soon as the door is open -- -- MIDNIGHT BOLTS out into the hall, a black streak moving toward the stairs and darting upward. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PATIENCE 
Midnight!   You little monster -- Patience tosses her groceries in the door, leaving it ajar, and runs after the cat. A few moments after she's vanished up the stairs, we hear FOOTSTEPS from below and... ANGEL, Georges Avenal's menacing bodyguard, appears in the hallway. He moves purposefully for Patience's door, pushes it open and steps inside. Midnight just saved her neck. 
INT. PATIENCE'S BUILDING - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT 
MIDNIGHT makes for an open hall window that leads onto a FIRE ESCAPE. Patience just spots her heading outside. 
PATIENCE 
Oh no... 
EXT. PATIENCE'S BUILDING - ALLEY - NIGHT 
Patience reaches the window just in time to see -- MIDNIGHT make a SPECTACULAR LEAP across the alleyway and -- 
-- LAND ON TOM LONE'S BALCONY. 
PATIENCE is annoyed, but also impressed, in spite of herself. 
PATIENCE 
Hell of a jump... 
INT. PATIENCE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
ANGEL flings open the closet and bathroom doors in Patience's empty apartment -- no dice. On his way out, he eyes a plate of cat food and ice cream with a wince. 
EXT. LONE'S BUILDING - ALLEY - NIGHT 
Patience clumsily CLAMBERS up Lone's RATTLING FIRE ESCAPE, reaches the level Midnight is on, moves toward the cat. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PATIENCE 
You are not worth the trouble -- Suddenly, a WINDOW FLIES OPEN, just a foot away, a GUN points in her face. Patience lets out a CRY, jumps back -- 
LONE 
Freeze! It's TOM LONE.     But Patience loses her balance, FALLS -- -- and LANDS in an open DUMPSTER. LONE darts from the window, alarmed, realizing his error. 
EXT. PATIENCE'S BUILDING - NIGHT 
ANGEL emerges, shaking his head and shrugging toward the unseen driver of the BLACK MERCEDES, then he climbs in the passenger door. As the car pulls away -- -- LONE hurries from the building next-door toward the alley. 
EXT. PATIENCE'S BUILDING - ALLEY - NIGHT 
PATIENCE painfully gets upright, slipping in the trash, as LONE appears; he's a no-nonsense, gruff cop with a dry wit. 
LONE 
You all right? He clambers onto the dumpster's edge to help her out, she slips and slides, almost pulls him in after her. 
LONE 
I'm really sorry -- I'm a police officer, I heard the noise and just assumed... here, grab my arm. He manages to hoist Patience to the lip, she's able to climb to the ground. She's drenched in GOOEY GARBAGE, just stares at Lone, a bit dazed from the fall. She can't believe she's face to face with the man of her dreams. Lone thinks a beat. 
LONE 
Habla espanol? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
She blinks at him, confused, then he tentatively flashes a few HAND SIGNS for the deaf. She waves this off. 
PATIENCE 
No, I -- see, my cat got out -- MIDNIGHT MEWS, rubs against Patience's leg.      She picks the cat up, nods toward her window. 
PATIENCE 
I live right up there -- 
LONE 
I know. 
PATIENCE 
You do? 
LONE 
I mean, I -- I've seen you.   Around. 
PATIENCE 
Really.   Actually, I've seen you too.   Around, that is. (a nod at the dumpster) Thanks for helping me out.

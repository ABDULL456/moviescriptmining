{"test1_input": "AUDREY Are you hungry? Let me heat it up for you. \nArthur heads toward the microwave with the plate. Audrey intercepts the plate from him and dumps the contents into a skillet. \nAUDREY (CONT'D) I'll heat it up on the stove for you. Tastes better. \nALIKE Dad-- \nAUDREY Lee! \nARTHUR Leave me out of it. \nAUDREY Go get changed. \nALIKE Dad, what's wrong with this outfit? \nARTHUR Nothing. \nALIKE See? \nAUDREY I'm not gonna argue with you. \nARTHUR Do what she says. \nALIKE Dad-- \nARTHUR (speaking bad Tarzan Swahili) Umgowa! \nAUDREY And put on a skirt! \nAlike stalks off to her bedroom. Sharonda bounces into the kitchen. \nSHARONDA Hey Dad! \nAUDREY Too much lipstick. \nSHARONDA It's lipgloss. \nAudrey wheels on Sharonda with a death glare. \nSHARONDA (CONT'D) Okay, okay. \nARTHUR Gimmie kiss. \nSharonda pecks dad on the cheek. Dad wipes his cheek and rubs his fingers together. \nSharonda giggles and bounds back into her bedroom. Audrey slides a steaming plate in front of Arthur. \nAUDREY Did you talk to her? \nARTHUR Get me a beer, please. Sharonda's fine. \nAUDREY I'm talking about Lee. \nARTHUR Alike. And I don't see that there's a problem. \nAUDREY I'm tired of this tomboy thing she's got going on. And Laura. You said you were going to handle it. \nARTHUR Umm-hmm. \nAUDREY She needs a male point of view. \nARTHUR I said okay, dammit! Now can I please have a beer please? \nAUDREY It's Sunday morning. \nARTHUR It goes with the spaghetti. \nAudrey lifts a beer out of the fridge and slides it in front of Arthur. She pulls up a chair as he plows through the meal, her expression softening as she caresses his forearm. \nAUDREY Do you have to work tonight? \nARTHUR To put food on the table and clothes on our backs, no. To go out to restaurants and keep designer sneakers in the closet, yes. \n", "test1_true": "ARTHUR Are you forever going to be happy? (beat) You made that decision a long time ago. \nAUDREY We both made sacrifices. \nAlike stomps back into the kitchen wearing the pink v-neck that Audrey bought her and an unflattering pleat-front skirt. Arthur stifles a giggle behind his beer can. \nARTHUR You look beautiful, baby. \nAUDREY Tuck your blouse in. \nALIKE This isn't me. \nAUDREY Tuck your blouse in. \nARTHUR Leave it out. \nAudrey frowns at Arthur. Arthur stands his ground. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) I think it's fine out. What's the deal with you and Laura? \nALIKE What deal? \nAUDREY Comin' in late... \nALIKE Dad, I hardly ever-- \nARTHUR Why don't you give that a break for a little while? \nALIKE Dad, come on... \nAUDREY (to Alike) You heard him! (MORE) \n(to Sharonda) Sharonda! You done?! \nAlike spins into the living room defeated. \nSHARONDA (O.S.) Coming! \nAUDREY You coming with us? \nARTHUR Nope. Sleep. \nAUDREY We could go to a later service. The one o'clock-- \nARTHUR I said NO!! \nArthur slams his fork on the plate. Audrey flinches. Alike looks up. Sharonda appears in the doorway, looking from Audrey to Arthur. \nSHARONDA I'm ready. \nArthur pushes up from the table. \nARTHUR Alike, you look beautiful. Everybody looks beautiful, okay? \nArthur disappears into the bedroom. Alike snatches up her bible and launches out the door, Sharonda follows. Audrey pulls on her sunglasses and hat and slams the door behind her. \n34   EXT. CHURCH - DAY                                            34 \nAlike sits in the passenger seat of the car as Audrey chit chats with other churchgoers. Sharonda sits in the back seat, flipping through a CD case and occasionally passing CD's to Alike to play. Alike faces stonily forward except to cast impatient glances in Audrey's direction. Audrey raps on the window. \nAUDREY Lee! Lee! Here's someone I want you to meet. \nAlike cracks the window an inch. \nALIKE Huh? \nAudrey motions to Bina standing by with her mother, Ms. Singletary. Alike cracks the window a little wider and acknowledges them with a half-hearted wave. \nALIKE (CONT'D) Oh. Hey. \nAUDREY Get down out the car and come speak. \nLaboriously, Alike rolls the window back up, turns off the car radio, and climbs down out of the car. \n", "test1_id": 1437, "test2_input": "MRS. SINGLETARY (O.S.) Hello? Hi Audrey. Yes. Yeah she's here. I understand-- \nAlike sulks. Bina flips to the back of the CD book. \nBINA Alright, how about Rock? \nALIKE It's cool. \nBINA Whatchu know about Santogold? Since you all underground and stuff. \nALIKE She's tight. \nBINA Tamar-kali? \nALIKE I haven't heard of her, I heard of Res. \nAlike hoists the backpack onto her shoulder and stands to leave. \nBINA Oh no this is way better, you gotta check her out. \nBina jams her iPod onto the stereo adapter. The thick, fierce guitar rhythms of Tamar-kali's \"Boot\" consume the room. Bina chants the lyrics along with the music. \nBINA (CONT'D) \"Her hair is short. Her legs are brown. Her lips are full. Her head hangs down.\" \nAlike plops back down in her chair. \nALIKE Wow. \n44   INT. ALIKE'S KITCHEN - SAME TIME INTERCUT                    44 \nAudrey smooths a pink sticky note onto a foil covered plate and shoves it into the fridge. The doorbell rings and she rushes across the room and opens the door in her most sing- song voice. \nAUDREY He-llooo. \nLAURA Hello Mrs. Freeman. Is Lee home please? \nAUDREY She's out with her friend right now, Laura. You take care. \nAudrey starts to close the door.   Laura stops it with her hand. \nLAURA Oh. Umm do you know when she'll be back? \nAUDREY No, I believe she's out for the evening. \nLAURA Oh, because we had umm... alright then... Thank you. \nAUDREY Goodnight. \nAudrey shuts the door harder than necessary. Laura checks her phone and shakes her head. \n45   INT.

(MORE) \nBlood is gone but the memory lingers...twist a virgin `round your bloody little finger, love is gone, but the memory lingers!\" \nAlike is bobbing her head, backpack forgotten on her shoulder. Bina cranks the volume down. \nALIKE Yo, this shit is hot! \nBINA Told you. Don't you have to go? I'll cover. It's cool. \nALIKE Nah, I wanna stay. \nAlike slings her backpack to the floor and pulls the CD book into her lap. Her cell phone rings and she ignores it. \n46   EXT. THE PIERS - LATER                                    46 \nThe pier is a parade of mohawks, curly weaves, tight jeans, and rainbow belts as groups of baby dykes, young queens, and gender queer youth of all shades of brown stroll cavort, and strut seeing and wanting to be seen. Equally bedecked observers hoot and yell from bench and rail perches on both sides. Laura jabs numbers into her cell phone. Competing threads of house music throb across the boardwalk in muffled bursts as groups of ballers vogue and prance behind her. \nALIKE (V.O.) Leave a message and I'll call you back. BEEP. \nLaura yanks her phone away from her ear and looks at the screen. She starts to hang up but pulls it back to her ear. \n", "test2_true": "47   INT. BINA'S BEDROOM - LATER                               47 \nAlike and Bina are sprawled in the floor. Bina DJ's from her laptop. \nALIKE Mrs. Alvarado was trying to get me to check out this one place. \nAlike hands her the flyer. Bina laughs and tosses it back. \nBINA Oh hell, no. That's for old people-- I'll write down some places you should check out. Maybe you could read some of my stuff, too. \nALIKE Definitely. \n48   EXT. THE PIERS - SAME TIME INTERCUT                          48 \nLaura scowls at her cell phone screen. She shoves the phone in her pocket and pulls her hoodie up against the chill of the evening. Brake lights bathe Laura and her circle of AG's in red as late-night predators cruise the strip for fresh meat. Laura catches sight of shady sexual encounters in an alley across the street and looks away. One of the entourage passes Laura a joint and she inhales deeply. A few of the girls have backpacks and the group is pensive as they break off and scatter into the night one by one. \nPIER GIRL #1 `Member when we used to stay out here all night? \nPIER GIRL #2 Shit, used to? \nPIER GIRL #1 You stay with your sister now, huh? \nLaura nods and spits. \nPIER GIRL #2 Lucky as hell. \n49   INT. AP ENGLISH CLASSROOM - AFTERNOON                        49 \nAP English class is a safe haven. The desks are pulled together in a rough circle and are filled with heavily pierced, dyed hair, and vintage clothes types. Mrs. Alvarado sits cross-legged atop her desk taking notes. Alike stands at the center of the circle reciting an original poem. \nALIKE A butterfly, briefly Suffocated On the mucous of its own change Imprisoned (MORE) \nBy the membranous chaff of its own underdeveloped Wings And Cramped In the darkness of the too-tight cocoon of its own creation Pauses Thinking death inevitable Prepares to die in the absolute solitude Of Swollen Husk.

ALVARADO Comments? Critiques? Julie, tell me what you think. \nA forest of hands go up as Alike winds her way back to her seat. A few classmates whisper brief encouragements. Bina nods and smiles at Alike. Unguarded, Alike smiles back. \n50   EXT. STREET - DAY                                            50 \nBina and Alike troop home at a more leisurely pace. Alike breaks the silence for once. \nALIKE I liked your story, though. It was tight. \nBINA Yeah? Which one? The one about the-- \nALIKE The one about karma, how things come back to you. That one, I thought it was tight. \nBINA For real? Thanks. I wasn't gonna say anything, but I liked yours too. \nALIKE Why? \nBINA Why did I like it or why wasn't I gonna say anything? \nALIKE Why did you like it? \nBINA I don't know. I guess because it felt honest. \nALIKE Oh. \nBINA Didn't you have on a different shirt earlier? \nALIKE What? \nBINA Nothin'. \nALIKE No, what'd you say? \nBINA Nothin'. \nALIKE Yeah, I had on a different shirt. \n", "test2_id": 1438, "test3_input": "I'ma look his ass up in the system. Ha-ha! Wait `till your mama finds out. She'll be so goddamn happy. \nAlike plays along, swallowing her disappointment. \nALIKE Yeah. \nArthur pushes back from the table and pulls a fresh police uniform out the hall closet. He lays it across the back of the couch and unzips his pants. Alike turns her back to give him privacy. \nARTHUR Say uh--there's this new--uh women's club up there by the liquor store--have you--do you--you haven't heard anything about it, right? \nAlike shakes her head no. Arthur tucks his undershirt into his pants. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Called the Kitty Litter, the Catbox, something like that? \nALIKE Nah, I never even heard of it. \nARTHUR Good. `Cause you know that's a uh...it's a rough neighborhood. You know that right? I had a case over there. You wanna be careful--stay away from that element. Just in case it ever comes up? \nALIKE I'll be careful. \nARTHUR Good. I know you will. \nAlike glances back at Arthur and sees that he's decent. She scoots back around to face him. Arthur smooths his uniform shirt into his pants. \nALIKE Dad, when you were on the phone earlier? It sounded like...I mean...I guess you're headed back to work, huh? \nARTHUR Yep. Your mama still up? \nALIKE Probably. \nARTHUR Tell her I had to work. \nArthur picks up his work tote and kisses Alike on the forehead. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Love you. \n56   INT. LAURA'S KITCHEN - MORNING                            56 \nLaura jams a pillow into a t-shirt as a makeshift pillowcase as she escorts one of the pier girls to the couch. The pier girl looks slightly unkempt and is relieved to plop her knapsack on the floor. Laura tosses the pillow onto the couch. \nLAURA My sister gets home at six so, you gotta be gone by then. \nPIER GIRL #2 Good looking. \nLAURA There's some lunchmeat in there too, help yourself. \nPIER GIRL #2 `Preciate ya. \nLaura pulls up close to the kitchen table. The GED test prep book, now dog-eared and worn is on the table in front of her. \nShe finds her place and copies notes and multiple choice answers into a spiral notebook. A stack of old Math and English textbooks are in a chair next to her and the room is peaceful and still save for the scratching of her pencil. \n57   INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - AFTERNOON                           57 \nAlike spies on Bina stuffing books into her locker. She draws her breath and approaches. \nALIKE Hey. \nBINA Hey. \nA long awkward silence. Alike leans against the bank of lockers, not daring to make eye contact. \nALIKE I'm sorry about the other day. \nBINA It's cool. \nBina pretends to rearrange books in her locker. \nALIKE (CONT'D) Things have been crazy. But look, I'm sorry I bugged out. It's just...I didn't know that you...I wasn't expecting that. \nBINA You still coming to the party? \nALIKE I don't know--I need to try and catch up with Laura. \n", "test3_true": "ALIKE But I do wanna hang out...I mean...maybe we could do both. \nBina smiles and shuts the locker door. \nBINA Cool.

FAMILY CAR - DAY                                        58 \nArthur coaches Alike as she navigates the car to a jerky stop in front of Mack's liquor store. \nARTHUR Easy, easy now. Watch your right hand side. \nALIKE I am. \nARTHUR Don't ride the brakes though. Good. \nALIKE See? I'm getting better!! Can I drive back? \nArthur rubs his chest in mock heart-attack. \nARTHUR I don't about that. You're shaky girl, you're shaky. Get us some chips and I'll think about it. \nArthur hands Alike a five dollar bill and she bounces down out of the car. \n59   EXT. LIQUOR STORE - CONTINUOUS                               59 \nArthur shouts a greeting to Mack who lounges on a plastic chair outside his door. Sock and TWO OTHER MEN chit chat nearby. Their chatter lowers as Arthur approaches. Alike bops into the store. \nMACK Hey, baby! \nALIKE Hey Mr. Ferguson! \nMACK I see Alike's been running circles around you again! \nARTHUR Little bit, little bit. I still got it though. \nArthur claps Mack on the shoulder and glimpses Sock whispering to one of the men. \nArthur follows the men's gazes over to Alike at the potato chip rack. She twirls the string of her basketball shorts round and round her finger and idly hikes the collar of her t- shirt up over her nose. The smile evaporates from Arthur's face. \nSock peers back at him, smirking. Arthur starts toward him, when Alike saunters out between them. \nARTHUR We better get going. \nMACK (CONT'D) Gone already? \nARTHUR I'll holler at you later. \nArthur crosses the lot in a bound, snatches the car keys from Alike's hand, and hustles her into the car. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Get in the car. \nALIKE But you said I could drive-- \nARTHUR I said get in the car! \nAlike frowns, then catches sight of the men in front of the store. She slumps into the car and slams the door. Arthur piles into the driver's seat. They sit in silence for a moment, Alike traces the lines in her hands. \n60   INT. ARTHUR'S CAR - CONTINUOUS                               60 \nARTHUR Look...umm...you know you're daddy's girl, right? \nAlike avoids eye contact, staring out her window. Arthur searches her face a moment longer, then starts the car and pulls away in silence. \n61   INT. ALIKE'S APARTMENT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                   61 \nAudrey reclines on the couch reading a book. The doorknob jiggles and Audrey folds the book against her chest, pretending to be asleep. \n", "test3_id": 1439}

{"train": "PARIAH \nWritten by \nDee Rees \nSUPER: \"WHEREVER THE BIRD WITH NO FEET FLEW, SHE FOUND TREES WITH NO LIMBS.\" --- AUDRE LORDE \nFADE IN: \n1   EXT/INT. NIGHTCLUB- EVENING                                   1 \nA disembodied gaggle of jersey clad shoulders, jeans, and hats crosses a narrow street. Lights flare, hands are stamped, torsos are patted down. Money exchanges hands. We descend into a black, throbbing tunnel. \nExplicit music booms from bassy club speakers.   Hips, legs feet dancing. \nA GO-GO DANCER struts and wiggles around a brass pole.   Hoots and cheers. \nThe dancer marches in place, rolling her thonged bottom. More cheers, greedy hands stuff dollars into her waistband. \nFEMALE DJ (O.S.) Let's go! Where all my sexy Sagittarian ladies at? \nArms go up.   A collection of whoops ripple the crowd. \nThe dancer wraps her legs around the pole and oozes upward headfirst. The CAMERA ROTATES as she stretches her booted heels into the crowd. We realize that she has been dancing on the ceiling. \nFEMALE DJ (O.S.) Oh my God! \nALIKE (pronounced AH-LEE-KAY), 17, covers her mouth, laughing and wide-eyed. She tries to back away from the stage, but is pushed forward by a torrent of eager arms waving dollar bills. Among them is LAURA, 18, worldly and smooth. \nLAURA Where your singles at?!! Where your singles at?!! Yeah, baby! \nLaura strains over Alike's shoulder to tuck a bill into the dancer's boot. Alike drops her beer in all the jostling. \nFEMALE DJ Goddamn I love my job! \nLaura stuffs a bill into Alike's now empty hand and forcibly waves Alike's wrist in the air. \nAlike pulls free just as the dancer takes notice and begins to direct her attention at her. \nALIKE Stop! Chill!! \nLAURA Whatchu' come here for?! \nAlike shoves the dollar bill into Laura's chest and shoulders her way past the wall of onlookers surrounding the stage. Laura shrugs, puts the bill in her teeth and lays her head at the edge of the stage. Alike looks away and breaks through a snarl of clubgoers just as the dancer begins to descend. \nALIKE Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me. Oof, sorry ladies. \nFinally free of the throng, Alike takes a breath and looks at the clock on her cell phone. \nALIKE (CONT'D) Shit! \nShe rolls her eyes back to the stage where Laura is no longer visible. Not daring to risk another plunge into the throbbing crowd, she retreats for the bar. \nFEMALE DJ Let's go! \n2   INT. NIGHTCLUB BAR- NIGHT                                     2 \nAlike beaches at an empty spot at the bar. Her gaze settles on a CUTE GIRL a little ways down, staring out at the dance floor. Alike jerks her eyes away and smooths the front of her shirt and adjusts her hat as she edges toward the girl. \nALIKE Hi. \nThe girl ignores her. Alike clears her throat and speaks a little too loudly. \nALIKE (CONT'D) Umm... Hey! How are you?! \nThe girl jerks around and frowns at Alike, looking her up and down. \nCUTE GIRL What?! \nALIKE Umm...sorry. I was just sayin' Umm...hi. \nCUTE GIRL Oh. \nALIKE Shut up! \nLAURA Trying to help your ass. I'm sayin', whatchu waitin' for?! \nAlike shrugs it off, her smile fading a little. Laura elbows her and sneers. \nLAURA Kickin' that same `ol quiet shit since 6th grade. I don't need to press, I gets plenty. Shit. \nALIKE Wah-wah. \nLAURA I get more pussy than your daddy, nigga, what?! \nALIKE Oh shit!! Yeah, you got me with that one. \n7   INT. BUS - NIGHT                                              7 \nAlike becomes more quiet and less playful as the ride wears on. A middle-class Bronx landscape, well-lit with a newly constructed Starbucks and renovated condos flits by the window. Alike reaches over and presses the tape. Laura elbows Alike. \nLAURA Quit playing. \nALIKE Your stop. \nLAURA Huh? \nALIKE Your stop-- you're getting off here, right? \nLAURA Nah, I'll roll with you a few more stops. \nALIKE Why you gon' walk all the way back down for? That's stupid. \nLAURA Make sure you get home okay. \nThe bus pulls to the curb. The light flicks on over the back door. \nALIKE You ain't big, nigga. Trying to protect somebody. Hurry up, man, get off! \nLAURA (to bus driver) That's alright man--next stop. Next stop! \nAlike elbows Laura sharply. The bus driver frowns in the rear view. \nLAURA You ain't gotta push me, why're you beastin'? \nALIKE I'm not beastin'. \nLaura climbs over Alike and swings toward the door. \nLAURA You got a problem. Call me. \nALIKE I'ma call you. \nAlike turns and watches Laura stroll away. Laura drums a little beat on Alike's window as the bus pulls off. Alike waves and faces forward again. An OLD LADY sitting nearby shoots her a disapproving look. Alike rolls her eyes and moves to a seat farther away. \n8   INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS                                         8 \nAlike studies her reflection in the window, and takes a breath. She unbuttons her bulky men's shirt to reveal a fitting baby doll shirt that reads \"Princess.\" She stuffs her baseball cap and durag into her backpack and jabs a pair of small gold hoop earrings into her ears. She slumps back against the seat and stares into the night. \nThe bus stops at a lonely island of curb. Alike is a dark silhouette sprinting around the corner and into the night. \n9   INT. ALIKE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                9 \nAlike cracks open the front door just wide enough to slip through. The house is dark except for the flashing microwave clock. \nAlike takes off her sneakers and pads down the hallway. Her younger sister, SHARONDA's door cracks open as she passes. \nSHARONDA You late. \nALIKE (whispering) Be quiet. \nSHARONDA Where you been this late? \nALIKE (whispering) Movies. \nSHARONDA Movie ended at midnight. \nAudrey leaves. Alike is still. She listens for the door to her parent's room to shut before snatching off the scarf and storming to the bathroom. \n11   INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT                                     11 \nAlike turns on the faucet, wets the soap and puts it back in the dish, wets her wash cloth and puts it back on the rack. She plops down on the toilet and looks up. A crucifix frowns down at her from the wall. \nShe averts her eyes and stands to leave. \nAUDREY (O.S.) Did you brush your teeth? \nAlike wets her toothbrush and throws it back into the holder. \nAUDREY (O.S.) Lee? \nAlike squeezes out a dollop of toothpaste and smears a little around the sink. She stares at her reflection. \nAUDREY (O.S.) Lee? \nAlike flicks water droplets at the mirror for good measure. \nALIKE Yes, mom. \n12   EXT. SCHOOL - MORNING                                     12 \nAlike, bundled in an oversized hoodie edges up to the perimeter of campus and waits against a bus shelter. STUDENTS horseplay and mill about the entrance in groups, chugging their morning Fantas and munching on snack cakes. The school bell rings and the lawn slowly empties into the building. Alike shifts her weight and checks her watch as the last STRAGGLERS finally trickle in. She yanks her hoodie tighter and launches across the lawn and into the building. \n13   INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - MORNING                             13 \nA second school bell sounds and the din of slamming lockers and jubilant chatter dies to a hush as students shuffle into classrooms. Alike cracks the back stairwell door and peeks out into the mostly empty hallway before tearing for the bathroom. One last straggler BINA, a 17 year-old girl with mature, but down-to-earth good looks rushes past Alike. The two exchange a brief, confused look then mutually dismiss each other as they hurry in opposite directions. \n14   INT. SCHOOL BATHROOM - MORNING                            14 \nAlike hurtles into the handicapped stall and snaps it shut behind her. She rips off her hoodie and the \"girly\" shirt beneath and flings them to the floor. She pulls out a pair of wife-beaters from her bag and pulls them over her head. She unwads a polo shirt and yanks it over her head. \nShe stares at her reflection in the window and tries unsuccessfully to smooth her shirt. Her eyes scour her reflection again and again for any imperfections. She spots the earrings and yanks them out of her ears. The late bell beckons and Alike stuffs her \"feminine\" clothes into her backpack and bolts. \n15   INT. MATH CLASSROOM - DAY                                    15 \nThe MATH TEACHER glides up and down the aisles passing out graded tests. A chorus of groans follows in her wake. \nMATH TEACHER As promised, I will be grading these on a curve. \nAlike is folded into the backmost corner of the classroom. The desks in front her and beside her are empty. She is ignored as the rest of the class chatters and passes notes. \nMATH TEACHER (CONT'D) But the highest grade on the test was a 98. \nThe math teacher puts Alike's test on her desk and gives her a little smile. Alike doesn't smile back. \nThe lunch bell rings and the class is a tornado, clearing the room in a rush of limbs, shouts, and backpacks. Alike jabs her headphones into her ears and packs her bag very deliberately, letting the eye of the storm pass over her before heading toward the door. \n16   INT. SCHOOL CAFETERIA - DAY                                  16 \nThe cafeteria is a whirl of activity and social jockeying. Clusters of girls and boys loud-talk, flirt, fight and horseplay at tables and in tight little groups against the walls. Alike walks alone, staying at the fringes of the crowd and shrugs through the cafeteria line. \n17   INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY                                    17 \nAlike flees the cafeteria, tray laden with rubbery cuisine of dubious nutritional value. She raps on the door of a classroom and slips in. \nMRS. ALVARADO (O.S.) Hey there! \n18   INT. AP ENGLISH CLASSROOM - DAY                             18 \nALIKE Hey! \nMRS. ALVARADO, a middle aged Californian ex-hippie type reclines with her feet on her desk, munching on celery sticks and sunflower seed paste. Her small desk radio plays alternative rock. Sun beams into the empty classroom and Alike squints as she yanks the headphones out of her ears and pulls up a chair next to her desk. \nMRS. ALVARADO Whaddja bring me? \nALIKE Nothin' you can eat. \nMRS. ALVARADO You shouldn't be eatin' that crap, either. \nALIKE (over a mouthful of pizza) I know. \nAUDREY Yeah see isn't this cute? \nMRS. SINGLETARY Umm-hmm. That's for your daughter? \nAUDREY Yeah, this is for Alike. \nMRS. SINGLETARY The youngest one. \nAUDREY No she's the oldest one. \nMRS. SINGLETARY Oh, the other one. Okay. \nAUDREY What, you think it's too young? \nMRS. SINGLETARY No, no. For whatever reason the youngest one popped in my mind first. But I think it should be fine. It's really cute. \nAUDREY Thank you. \nMRS. SINGLETARY It'll compliment her figure. \nAUDREY Now see that's what I thought... But Lee doesn't like anything I pick out for her anymore. \nMrs. Singletary takes a bite of her lunch and takes the sweater from Audrey. \nMRS. SINGLETARY Girl, please. My oldest, 17 going on 27 mind you, banned me from buying her any more clothes. We have two completely different tastes. I just give her gift cards now and trust me, we're both happier for it. Is it her birthday? \nMrs. Singletary hands the sweater back to Audrey who smooths it carefully back into the tissue paper. \nAUDREY No, no. I just wanted to get her something nice. You know. \nThree ROWDY CO-WORKERS burst into the room chattering and finger popping. \nROWDY CO-WORKER #1 Hey, Brenda! \nROWDY CO-WORKER #2              ROWDY CO-WORKER #3 Oooooh Audrey, you got me a     What'chall in here talking present?                        about? \nAUDREY Well, no we-- \nMRS. SINGLETARY None of yo' damn business!! \nThe co-workers hoot in unison and descend upon the various parts of the breakroom. Audrey shoves the sweater back in the bag and nestles it between her feet. Somebody cranks on a small radio and a frisky R&B beat invades the air. Mrs. Singletary pats Audrey on the arm. \nMRS. SINGLETARY Let me know how it goes. \nAUDREY Oh I will. I'll call you when-- \nROWDY CO-WORKER #3 Hey Bren' this is what I was telling you about!! \nCo-worker #3 shoves a tabloid in Mrs. Singletary's face, tapping an angry orange fingernail in the middle of the page. \nMRS. SINGLETARY Is that her?! \nROWDY CO-WORKER #3              ROWDY CO-WORKER #2 Told you!                       Look how big she done got! \nThe center of the room shifts and Audrey is once again alone at the fringes. She collects her shopping bag and looks around to say goodbye, but no one notices her leave. \n21   INT. ALIKE'S KITCHEN - EVENING                            21 \nAudrey, Sharonda, Alike, and their father, ARTHUR, 40- something with a used-to-be athletic build, are all gathered around the dinner table for a rare family dinner. Everyone takes half-hearted nibbles at their food avoiding eye contact with each other. Sharonda picks at her food. \nSHARONDA I don't see why we can't just watch TV like usual. \nAlike elbows Sharonda. \nSHARONDA Quit it! \nALIKE Shut up. \nSHARONDA You don't tell me what to do! \nAUDREY Girls. \nThe phone rings and Arthur beats a path to bedroom to get it. Audrey wilts. \nLAURA I can get some more hours-- \nCANDACE No. You know what you need to do. \nLAURA Nah Candy, I can't just dip out on you like that-- \nCANDACE I was doing just fine before you moved in, remember? I can handle it. \nLaura sucks her teeth. \nCANDACE (CONT'D) You working was only supposed to be temporary. Mom would've wanted-- \nLAURA Who?! Man, don't even-- \nCANDACE She would've-- \nLAURA Stop. \nLaura pushes up from the table and glares at Candace, a showdown. Candace stares back, unfazed. Laura caves first. \nLAURA (CONT'D) I'll get the money orders in the morning. \nLaura tugs at the envelope but Candace doesn't let go right away. \nLAURA (CONT'D) I'll look into it alright? \nCandace relinquishes the envelope and Laura stalks off down the hallway to her room. \nCANDACE The next test is coming up soon! \nLAURA (O.S.) I said I'll look into it! \nCandace smiles wanly and sips her soup. She takes a foot out of the water and kneads it. \n23   INT. SCHOOL BATHROOM - MORNING                            23 \nAlike slams into her usual stall and launches into her `Superman' changing routine. She unrolls pulls a jersey from her backpack and yanks it over her head. \n24   EXT. SCHOOL LAWN - AFTERNOON                              24 \nAlike sits off to one side of the stairs, headphoned into oblivion and scribbling into her composition book. A group of FAST GIRLS strut by and encamp on the opposite wall, giggling and yakking on cell phones. One of the girls, MIKA cuts a flirty smile at Alike. Alike turns away and buries herself in her book, but cranks down the volume on her iPod. \nMIKA'S FRIEND It was like seven of us--Me, Khalil, Misha, Tamara.... \nFAST GIRL #2 Tamara Marks? \nMIKA'S FRIEND Heeeell no--Fat Tamara. \nMIKA Oh I was about to say, Tamara Marks is a ughh--I can't stand her. \nMIKA'S FRIEND Anyway, it was all of us and oh Laura, you know that girl from the restaurant? She was there with one of her friends. \nAlike's ears prick up. \nMIKA That gay chick? Ya'll be hanging like that? \nMIKA'S FRIEND Yeah, well it's a couple of them. She's mad cool though, so sometime she come out with us every now and then, anyway-- \nMIKA Man, y'all be doin' it on it weekends, let me find out! \nFAST GIRL #2 I told your butt to come. \nMIKA'S FRIEND But anyway-- \nMIKA Some of them AG's are kinda cute-- I'm not saying I would, but I would holla. \nFAST GIRL #2 I don't know about all that. \nMIKA Isn't that one of them over there? What's her name? Amika?--Alisha? \nThe pack directs their attention at Alike. Alike profiles and attempts to look casual. \nMIKA'S FRIEND Alike. \nALIKE I don't want to holla at girls in the club. \nLAURA Obviously. Why you pressed about this chick? \nAlike shrugs. \nALIKE I wanted to ask you about something else too. \nLAURA Oh God, what now? \nALIKE I need you to get something for me. \nLAURA What?! \nAlike cocks her head at Laura. Laura frowns back. \nLAURA What?! \nALIKE Just for my image. \nAlike raises her eyebrow. Laura shakes her head. The light bulb goes off. She roars in disbelief. \nLAURA WHAAAAAT???!! You trying to strap!!?? Whaaatt?!! Oh my God, what are you going through... \nALIKE Please. \nLAURA What difference you think having a bulge in your pants gon' make? \nALIKE Pleeeeease. By next Friday. \nLAURA Next Friday?! Okay-- Whatever. Oh my God I can't believe you ! Alright. Yeah. She better be cute for all of this... \n26   INT. ALIKE'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON                            26 \nAlike stares at herself in a floor length bedroom mirror in her underwear. \nLAURA I think it looks natural. \nA peach-colored dildo dangles stiffly from Alike's waist. The harness bunches her boxers in clumsy tufts. Alike appraises the racially inappropriate apparatus and shoots Laura a look. \nLAURA I'm serious, I mean it doesn't look that bad. \nALIKE I can't believe you. \nAlike frowns at the dildo in profile. \nLAURA What?! \nALIKE Laura, this doesn't look right. I'ma look stupid. \nLAURA Well, first of all-- I don't think its supposed to be on top of your underwear like that. \nALIKE I'm not putting this thing next to my skin, it pinches already. \nAlike yanks at the harness and her boxers trying to pull it out of her bottom. \nLAURA It's supposed to fit like that. \nALIKE They didn't have any brown? \nLAURA I didn't have time for all of that. The brown ones were too big, anyway. \nAlike struggling with the apparatus.   Laura smiles. \nALIKE Ugh! You gotta take it back. \nLAURA I can't take it back. \nALIKE Here's the receipt! \nLAURA Unh-unh. I'm not going back in there. One time was embarrassing enough. \nALIKE You grown! \nAUDREY Are you hungry? Let me heat it up for you. \nArthur heads toward the microwave with the plate. Audrey intercepts the plate from him and dumps the contents into a skillet. \nAUDREY (CONT'D) I'll heat it up on the stove for you. Tastes better. \nALIKE Dad-- \nAUDREY Lee! \nARTHUR Leave me out of it. \nAUDREY Go get changed. \nALIKE Dad, what's wrong with this outfit? \nARTHUR Nothing. \nALIKE See? \nAUDREY I'm not gonna argue with you. \nARTHUR Do what she says. \nALIKE Dad-- \nARTHUR (speaking bad Tarzan Swahili) Umgowa! \nAUDREY And put on a skirt! \nAlike stalks off to her bedroom. Sharonda bounces into the kitchen. \nSHARONDA Hey Dad! \nAUDREY Too much lipstick. \nSHARONDA It's lipgloss. \nAudrey wheels on Sharonda with a death glare. \nSHARONDA (CONT'D) Okay, okay. \nARTHUR Gimmie kiss. \nSharonda pecks dad on the cheek. Dad wipes his cheek and rubs his fingers together. \nSharonda giggles and bounds back into her bedroom. Audrey slides a steaming plate in front of Arthur. \nAUDREY Did you talk to her? \nARTHUR Get me a beer, please. Sharonda's fine. \nAUDREY I'm talking about Lee. \nARTHUR Alike. And I don't see that there's a problem. \nAUDREY I'm tired of this tomboy thing she's got going on. And Laura. You said you were going to handle it. \nARTHUR Umm-hmm. \nAUDREY She needs a male point of view. \nARTHUR I said okay, dammit! Now can I please have a beer please? \nAUDREY It's Sunday morning. \nARTHUR It goes with the spaghetti. \nAudrey lifts a beer out of the fridge and slides it in front of Arthur. She pulls up a chair as he plows through the meal, her expression softening as she caresses his forearm. \nAUDREY Do you have to work tonight? \nARTHUR To put food on the table and clothes on our backs, no. To go out to restaurants and keep designer sneakers in the closet, yes. \nAUDREY (CONT'D) What's wrong with you? \nALIKE Alright, Mom. \nAUDREY You'll have to excuse her, she's been feeling rude lately. \nMRS. SINGLETARY Oh don't worry, Audrey, I understand how it is. Hormones. It's just a phase. \nAUDREY Alike, this is Mrs. Singletary, one of my co-workers and her daughter, Bina. Sylvia, Bina, this is my daughter Alike, we call her \"Lee\" for short. \nAlike shakes both of their hands in turn. \nALIKE Hi. \nMRS. SINGLETARY Hello. \nALIKE Nice to meet you. \nBINA Hi. \nAUDREY And this is my youngest daughter, Sharonda. \nSHARONDA Hi. \nBINA Hi. \nMRS. SINGLETARY Hi there, nice to meet you. \nAUDREY Lee, Bina goes to the same school as you. \nALIKE Cool. \nBINA Yeah, I think I've seen you around. Mrs. Alvarado's class right? AP English? \nALIKE Yup. \nAudrey looks pleased with herself. Alike squirms. \nAUDREY So. Now that we're all acquainted, don't be a stranger. \nMRS. SINGLETARY Oh no, we won't. \nAUDREY Bina I think you and Lee may even go to school the same way. Don't you live off of St. James Place? \nMRS. SINGLETARY There is something to be said for safety in numbers. \nBina nods. Alike squirms. \nMRS. SINGLETARY (CONT'D) Well, we need to be pushing off -- I'll call you about those VBS workbooks. \nAlike retreats into the car, Sharonda hops in behind her. Alike reaches over and turns the key in the ignition. \nAUDREY Alrighty, I'll be around. Take care. \nAlike toots the horn. Audrey circles and gets in the driver's side. \n35   INT. FAMILY CAR - CONTINUOUS                                35 \nALIKE You're funny. \nAUDREY I don't know what your problem is. \nSHARONDA Can somebody put in this CD please? \nAudrey cranks the ignition and starts to back out. \nALIKE I don't know what you think is going to change. \nAUDREY I know God doesn't make mistakes. I know that much. \nAn invisible scab is ripped open in Alike and the fire dies in her eyes. Satisfied, Audrey slips the car into gear. \nAUDREY (CONT'D) You may not like Bina, but you're certainly gonna be spending much less time with that Laura person, I guarantee you that much. \nSOCK Fuck y'all! \nARTHUR I should arrest your ass. \nSOCK Man, fuck y'all!! \nMACK Free, don't pay him no mind. Just talkin' trash. \nMack playfully jabs him in the shoulder and bustles underneath the counter. Arthur's eyes linger on the door and his jaw tightens. \n40   INT. LAURA'S KITCHEN - DAY                                  40 \nLaura swings through the front door of her apartment, Alike close behind. She slides two twenty dollar bills underneath the ceramic hen on the table and breezes into her bedroom. \n41   INT. LAURA'S BEDROOM - LATER                                41 \nAlike is a paper doll in Laura's floor length mirror, dressed only in boxers and a wife beater. Laura holds a bright orange polo shirt up in front of Alike's torso. Alike cocks her head to the side and considers. \nLAURA Damn, this is your color. So what's the deal incog-negro? \nALIKE Mom has me hemmed up. \nLAURA Your phone ain't broke. You coulda called a nigga. Put this on. \nLaura pulls away the orange polo shirt and hands Alike a turquoise one instead. Alike hoists the oversized shirt over her head. \nALIKE My bad. She's making me hang out with this chick from church. It's crazy. \nLAURA Makin' you?! You a grown-ass woman, bruh! \nLaura shakes her head as she plucks a brand new baseball cap from the wall rack and drops it onto Alike's head. Alike considers and takes it off. Laura puts another cap in its place. Before Alike can object, Laura tosses her a pair of denim shorts. \nLAURA (CONT'D) Try these with it. So I guess the piers is out for Saturday, huh? \nALIKE I don't even know if that's me anymore. \nAlike struggles into the jean shorts, widening her stance so they don't fall down. Laura tosses her a belt and admires Alike's reflection. \nLAURA Yeah, that's hot, yo. You should rock that. \nALIKE (CONT'D) I was gonna see if you wanna do something different? \nAlike strips off the baseball cap and hangs it back on the rack. \nLAURA Different like what? \nAlike peels out of the polo shirt. \nALIKE I don't know--maybe like a open mic or something. \nLAURA Open mic? Nah, man. It's plenty chicks at the piers, you just gotta be more confident. \nLaura crosses to her closet and scans its inventory. The jeans are arranged crisply on hangers from light to dark and some still have store tags. Most of the shirts are still enclosed in protective plastic covers from the dry cleaners. Laura passes Alike a perfectly folded button down shirt. \nLAURA (CONT'D) You can rock this. I haven't even worn it yet. But I understand if you got better things to do. \nAlike holds the shirt against her torso and stares at her reflection. She catches Laura's eager look in the mirror and wilts. \nALIKE Nah, I'm down. \nLAURA You sure? I don't want you getting hemmed up. \nALIKE Nah seriously, I'm down for whatever. \nLAURA Real? \nALIKE Promise. \nLAURA That's what's up! I'ma take the whole day off. It's gonna be tight watch... we gon' do it up! \nLaura holds a new pair of jeans against her body and does a little dance. Alike laughs wanly. \n42   INT. ALIKE'S PARENT'S BEDROOM - EVENING                   42 \nMRS. SINGLETARY (O.S.) Hello? Hi Audrey. Yes. Yeah she's here. I understand-- \nAlike sulks. Bina flips to the back of the CD book. \nBINA Alright, how about Rock? \nALIKE It's cool. \nBINA Whatchu know about Santogold? Since you all underground and stuff. \nALIKE She's tight. \nBINA Tamar-kali? \nALIKE I haven't heard of her, I heard of Res. \nAlike hoists the backpack onto her shoulder and stands to leave. \nBINA Oh no this is way better, you gotta check her out. \nBina jams her iPod onto the stereo adapter. The thick, fierce guitar rhythms of Tamar-kali's \"Boot\" consume the room. Bina chants the lyrics along with the music. \nBINA (CONT'D) \"Her hair is short. Her legs are brown. Her lips are full. Her head hangs down.\" \nAlike plops back down in her chair. \nALIKE Wow. \n44   INT. ALIKE'S KITCHEN - SAME TIME INTERCUT                    44 \nAudrey smooths a pink sticky note onto a foil covered plate and shoves it into the fridge. The doorbell rings and she rushes across the room and opens the door in her most sing- song voice. \nAUDREY He-llooo. \nLAURA Hello Mrs. Freeman. Is Lee home please? \nAUDREY She's out with her friend right now, Laura. You take care. \nAudrey starts to close the door.   Laura stops it with her hand. \nLAURA Oh. Umm do you know when she'll be back? \nAUDREY No, I believe she's out for the evening. \nLAURA Oh, because we had umm... alright then... Thank you. \nAUDREY Goodnight. \nAudrey shuts the door harder than necessary. Laura checks her phone and shakes her head. \n45   INT. BINA'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME INTERCUT                     45 \nBINA \"Twist a virgin `round your dirty little finger! (MORE) \nBlood is gone but the memory lingers...twist a virgin `round your bloody little finger, love is gone, but the memory lingers!\" \nAlike is bobbing her head, backpack forgotten on her shoulder. Bina cranks the volume down. \nALIKE Yo, this shit is hot! \nBINA Told you. Don't you have to go? I'll cover. It's cool. \nALIKE Nah, I wanna stay. \nAlike slings her backpack to the floor and pulls the CD book into her lap. Her cell phone rings and she ignores it. \n46   EXT. THE PIERS - LATER                                    46 \nThe pier is a parade of mohawks, curly weaves, tight jeans, and rainbow belts as groups of baby dykes, young queens, and gender queer youth of all shades of brown stroll cavort, and strut seeing and wanting to be seen. Equally bedecked observers hoot and yell from bench and rail perches on both sides. Laura jabs numbers into her cell phone. Competing threads of house music throb across the boardwalk in muffled bursts as groups of ballers vogue and prance behind her. \nALIKE (V.O.) Leave a message and I'll call you back. BEEP. \nLaura yanks her phone away from her ear and looks at the screen. She starts to hang up but pulls it back to her ear. \nBINA Oh... Well, that's cool. \nALIKE So why weren't you gonna say anything about it? \nBINA About your shirt? \nALIKE About the poem. \nBINA Cause you're moody. \nALIKE Moody? \nBINA And quiet. \nALIKE Man, I'm not moody. \nBINA Yeah, right. \nBina stops. \nALIKE What? \nBINA This is me. \nAlike looks up at the stoop, surprised. \nBINA (CONT'D) It's not so bad when there's some conversation, huh? \nAlike looks away. \nBINA (CONT'D) You wanna come up? \n51   INT. BINA'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON                             51 \nAlike sits on Bina's twin bed, looking around and really taking in the room for the first time. She reaches over and picks up a little molded soldier figure off of the shelf. Bina fishes around in a rack of CDs. \nALIKE Who gave you this? \nBINA What the bear? My dad. \nALIKE No, this. \nAlike holds the figurine out, Bina looks at it over her shoulder. \nBINA Oh that. Girl, my stupid ex- boyfriend gave me that. \nALIKE Oh. Cute. \nBina opens a CD case and pulls the booklet out. \nBINA Not really. I mean I guess it was at the time. \nBina lobs the little army man into a trash can across the room and hands Alike the booklet. \nBINA (CONT'D) Anyway, this is the other artist I was telling you about. Her stuff is like, bouncier. \nA buoyant Afropunk beat wafts through the bedroom. Bina plops down on the bed next to Alike. \nALIKE This is straight. You'll burn me a copy? \nBINA Yeah, I have a bunch of other stuff, too. (beat) So who do you hang out with? I don't really see you with anybody. \nAlike shrugs and rifles through her backpack. She pulls out her composition book. Awkward silence. \nBINA (CONT'D) I didn't mean it like that. I was just asking because I was curious. I don't really like anybody that goes there either. \nALIKE My friend Laura used to go there. Not now, but she's going back. \nBINA Oh because, I was just gonna say-- I'm going to this house party and you can come if you want to. \nBina waves her hand at the radio. \nBINA (CONT'D) They play this kind of music. \nPIER GIRL #1 Awww, we shoulda been done set you! \nLaura slaps hands with her partner. The unlucky pair of partners argue. The personal cheerleader kisses Laura on the neck. Alike looks away. \nPERSONAL CHEERLEADER Good game, baby! \nLAURA What's good, Lee? \nALIKE Just came to say wassup. \nLAURA Whatchu got, Ty? \nPIER GIRL #2 Three, maybe four. \nLAURA We goin' eight!! \nRoars of disbelief from around the table. Alike is quickly forgotten in the ruckus. Alike circles to Laura's side. The personal cheerleader looks her up and down. \nALIKE Can I talk to you for a second? \nLAURA Now I got to cut you!! Grab `em partner. We gonna run a Boston on that ass! (MORE) \n(to Alike) Yo, I'm busy right now. \nMore raucous laughter from the table. Alike endures another few moments of card slapping, table pounding dejection before leaning into Laura's ear. \nALIKE I really need to talk to you-- \nLAURA I said later! \nWide-eyed silence and scattered snickers around the table. Laura resumes her hand and the game banter cranks back up. Alike picks up her face and slips away. \nPIER GIRL #3 Thought that was your girl? \nLAURA Mind your business. Bam! That's what I thought! \nLaura slaps another card on the table and takes a deep swig of water. \n53   INT. ALIKE'S PARENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                        53 \nAudrey lies awake in bed. The clock on the nightstand indicates a little past two in the morning. She looks at the sliver of light underneath the bedroom door, the sound of Arthur's key in the door breaks the silence. Arthur's voice in hushed tones. Audrey rolls over and faces the wall. \n54   INT. ALIKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                 54 \nAlike watches her father's footsteps break up the light beneath her door. She tosses off her blankets and springs into the hallway. \nALIKE (loud whisper) Hey Dad! \nShe is talking to empty air. She eases down the hallway toward the kitchen and the sound of his muffled voice. \nALIKE (CONT'D) Dad? \nARTHUR (O.S.) Come on now, you know that's not what I want. That's not what I'm saying. That's not--listen to me. Are you gonna listen to me? \nALIKE Mom? \nAlike stops short outside the kitchen door, confused. \nARTHUR (O.S.) Lee? Hold on. \n55   INT. ALIKE'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS                           55 \nAlike swings around the corner. \nALIKE Huh? \nARTHUR No, not you. (into phone) Hey, I'll talk to you later, alright? My daughter's up. \nArthur flips his cell phone shut and tucks it into his pocket. He fishes a beer out of the fridge. \nALIKE Who was that? \nArthur sips his beer and walks over to the kitchen table. A foil covered plate with a little pink sticky note waits. \nArthur slips in and lays his holster on an armchair, not even bothering to approach Audrey's sleeping form. \nArthur peeks inside the fridge and inspects one of Audrey's foil covered plates. He tosses it aside and gathers sandwich ingredients instead. Audrey yawns and props herself up on one elbow. \nAUDREY Oh you're home? \nARTHUR Hey. \nAUDREY I must've dozed off. How long have you been in? \nARTHUR Hour. \nDad takes a bite of his sandwich and shoves the ingredients back into the fridge. \nAUDREY Did you see the plate in there? \nARTHUR This is fine. \nArthur plops down on an armchair and flips the TV channel to sports highlights. Mom scoots over on the couch. \nAUDREY There's room over here. You can see the TV better. \nARTHUR This is fine. \nArthur props his feet up on the coffee table and catches Audrey's hurt expression. He winks at her. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Thank you. \nAUDREY Just alike. \nARTHUR Say what? \nAUDREY You and your daughter. Have you talked to Lee yet? I told you she-- \nARTHUR I talked to Alike. \nAUDREY You did? \nARTHUR Everything's fine. Like I told you. Matter fact, she's got a boyfriend. \nAUDREY Boyfriend? \nARTHUR Just give her some space. \nAUDREY Space? She's hardly ever home in the first place and you're just like her, creeping in all hours of the night. Both of you. Running around like you got something to hide, like I'm the big, bad witch and what about me? I'm home by myself all the time and Sharonda's getting older and starting to go out and pretty soon-- \nARTHUR I don't have anything to hide. Look I told you I talked to Alike and everything is fine. \nAUDREY Did you ask her? \nDad slams down his half-eaten sandwich and stands up. \nARTHUR No, because I didn't have to. Besides,I would know okay? If anybody would know, it would be me. I know my daughter-- \nAUDREY Your daughter?!! \nARTHUR --better than anyone else and-- \nAUDREY So now all of a sudden she's just your daughter?! \nARTHUR                          AUDREY --I'm telling you she's just    Well I guess I better not fine!!                          have nothing else to say then, huh?! \nARTHUR That's your damn problem, you're too much of a damn worry wart. \nAUDREY Let's hope you're right, Detective. \nARTHUR Will you shut the fuck up?! \nAudrey jerks to her feet and flings the book aside. \nAUDREY An hour? Really? I'm not your dumb damn floozy in the street. And you will not talk to me that way. \nAudrey slaps the sandwich off Arthur's plate and storms to the bedroom. Arthur sees Sharonda peeking from her bedroom door but can't summon any words. Sharonda skitters into Alike's bedroom. \nLAURA What I'm saying is, I probably overreacted. (beat) And then...I don't know. Seeing you two together or whatever. I'm glad to see you're finally happy. \nALIKE C'mon man, you know you're my best friend. Nobody's gonna -- \nLAURA You don't need to say anything. I just wanted to get it off my chest. I'm happy for you, that's all. \nAlike shakes her head. Her mouth moves but nothing comes out. \nLAURA (CONT'D) Because I love you, alright? And I'm sayin'...I'm right here. \nAlike is stopped cold, as the light bulb finally goes off. Laura takes a long drag on the joint. Bina and Mika stumble over giggling. Bina hooks Alike's arm. Mika kisses Laura on the neck. Laura snaps out of her gaze, her familiar smirk creeping back. \nMIKA We goin' to get something to eat? \nLAURA That's what's up. \nALIKE Listen, umm-- \nLaura pinches out the joint and hands it to Mika who tucks it away. \nLAURA That's for later. Bina, nice to meet you. \nBINA You too. We had fun. \nLaura gives Bina a polite hug, pounds Alike on the shoulder and starts to lead Mika away. \nMIKA                                 ALIKE Byyeee!!                           Hey hold up! \nLaura pumps a lazy    fist in the air in acknowledgement. Bina takes Alike's hand    and slowly drags her away. Alike keeps looking back, then    finally gives up. Laura looks back just as Alike turns around    and disappears around the corner. \nBINA (CONT'D) I like your friends. They're cool. \n66   INT. BINA'S BEDROOM - LATER                                  66 \nMusic videos play on the TV. Alike and Bina lay stretched out on pillows, a plate of brownie crumbs between them. Alike dozes. Bina smacks her with a pillow. \nALIKE I'm not sleep. \nBINA Yes you are. \nAlike rubs sleep out of her eyes and props herself up on one elbow. \nALIKE Any brownies left? \nBINA Nope. \nBina flicks off the TV and stares at Alike. \nALIKE What? \nBINA Nothing. \nAlike looks away. \nBINA (CONT'D) What? \nALIKE Nothing. \nAlike folds her arms behind her head. Bina strokes Alike's stomach. Her finger's dance at the top of Alike's pajama bottoms. Their eyes meet. Alike sits bolt upright. \nBINA What're you doing? What's wrong? \nALIKE This is uh... I never... I'm sorry, I'm trippin' out. \nBINA It's okay. We don't have to. \nAlike leans in and kisses Bina on the lips. Bina considers and takes Alike's chin in her hand and kisses her back. Bina places Alike's hand on her chest. Alike lets her hand linger, then traces Bina's shoulders. \n67   INT. LAURA'S KITCHEN - MORNING                               67 \nLaura stands over the kitchen table shuffling through the mail. She pauses at a stiff envelope with her name on it. The return address reads \"NYS Educational & Testing Services\". She flips the envelope over and looks around, she rips the top off and eases the top of a slip out of the envelope. The top of the slip reads \"'Campbell, Laura' GED TESTING RESULTS.\" \n68   EXT. BRONX HOME - MORNING                                    68 \nBina moves away and levels her gaze at Alike for the first time. Alike touches Bina's elbow, Bina flinches away. \nBINA Look, I'm not gay okay? This isn't me--I wasn't--I'm not ready for all this... \nAlike recruits the discarded stuffed moose and dances it around on the bed. Bina recoils and snatches it away. Recognition seeps across Alike's pained face. Bina moves away from the bed and turns her back on Alike. \nAlike finds her pajama pants on the floor and yanks them on. She pulls on jeans over her pajama bottoms and hauls a sweatshirt down over her nightie. She flings her backpack open on the bed and hunts around the room wildly gathering her things. Alike goes in the bathroom and reappears with an armful of toiletries, dumping them in the bag. Bina watches her, arms folded. Alike takes one last look around the room and heads for the door, running a sleeve across her face. \nBINA (CONT'D) Lee? \nAlike ignores her and launches into the hallway.   Bina runs to her bedroom doorway. \nBINA (CONT'D) Wait--Lee?! \nAlike beelines for the front door. Bina chases Alike across the room. \nBINA (CONT'D) Lee, stop please? \nAlike wipes a sleeve across her swelling eyes and running nose and turns to face her. Bina takes several steps toward her. Alike lets go of the doorhandle, her voice cracks. \nALIKE What? \nBINA You promise you won't tell anybody? \n70   EXT. BINA'S HOUSE/STREET - DAY                            70 \nAlike rages outside, weaving blind fury down the sidewalk. She kicks over a cluster of garbage cans and cyclones out into the street, narrowly missing getting hit by a car. She continues her zag to the other sidewalk, her pace quickening. She rips open her backpack and launches a baseball cap into the air. She tears a handful of wifebeaters from the bag and flings them into the street. Spinning and thrashing she wrenches out a football jersey and jams it into another garbage can. She circles back and kicks the can over. She hurtles her backpack into the trees like a discus and sheds her hoodie like a skin before disappearing into the scream of a subway station. \n71   INT. ALIKE'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING                        71 \nLee bursts into the living room and charges to her bedroom. Audrey, who has been waiting in the living room storms in after her. \nAUDREY Where in the hell have you been?! \nAlike kicks off her shoes and paces the room. \nAUDREY (CONT'D) You hear me talking to you ?! Where you been? You left Bina's hours ago!!!! Lee-- \nALIKE I'M NOT YOUR HUSBAND!!!! \nAudrey gasps in stunned silence. \nALIKE (CONT'D) I'm not your husband so stop comin' at me like I am. I'm not your companion, I'm not your friend -- you made that abundantly clear--I'm your daughter and I have my own shit to deal with!! \nAUDREY LEE--don't you dare--Alike--I am your Mother-- \nAudrey melts back against the doorjamb. Alike slings off her shirt and slams the door in Audrey's face. A livid Audrey bangs on the door and jiggles the handle. \nAUDREY (CONT'D) You must have lost your damn mind! Wait until your father gets home! \n72   INT. ALIKE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS                         72 \nAlike attacks her closet, ripping all the \"girly\" shirts from the hangers and hurling them toward a small vanity trashcan. She plunges back in and slams an armful of blouses to the floor. She launches a pair of pumps into the wall, followed by a chunky pair of Timberlands. Silent sobs rack her body as she tears off her own shirt and slings it at the mirror. She strips off her jeans and kicks them brutally into a corner. Alike considers her unclothed form in the mirror before collapsing onto the bed. She writhes against the pillows and covers her eyes with her elbow as darts of grief twist through her body. Blackout. \n73   INT. ALIKE'S BEDROOM - LATER                              73 \nAlike jerks awake in her bed, a pillow pulled down around her ears. The sound of a muffled argument leaks from her parents's bedroom. The shouting gets louder, and Alike sits upright in her bed as her father's footsteps boom past her doorway and into the living room. Audrey's voice trails him down the hallway, and Alike scrambles into a t-shirt and shorts. \n74   INT. ALIKE'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING                        74 \nArthur's hand is on the doorknob, a small tote flung over his shoulder. Audrey blocks the door, her hands on her hips. They both look up as Alike edges into the living room. \nAUDREY You see, that's exactly what I'm talking about?! Get over here! \nARTHUR Go back to bed! \nAUDREY No, you come tell your father what you told me! \nARTHUR Don't drag her into this, Audrey! (to Alike) Go to your room, Alike. Your mom and I are having a discussion. \nAUDREY We are not discussing!! I wanna know right now-- \nARTHUR Go to your room! \nAUDREY There!! You see!! \nARTHUR You shut the hell up Audrey!! \nArthur extends his arms toward Alike, his voice trembling. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) I know that's not true. You tell your mother right now, Alike. You tell her it isn't true!! \nAlike meets her father's eyes. \nALIKE Dad-- \nARTHUR Don't you lie now, you tell the truth!! \nALIKE You already know. \nARTHUR No, I don't know. You tell your mother it's just a phase. \nALIKE It's not a phase! \nArthur is stopped cold, his shoulders slump. \nAUDREY See, if you would've DONE SOMETHING!! \nARTHUR (to Alike) What's wrong with you? \nALIKE There's nothing wrong with me! \nAUDREY This is your fault!! If you had-- \nArthur tears into Audrey, spittle flying. \nARTHUR AUDREY WILL YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP!!! \nAUDREY                          ARTHUR DON'T YOU SCREAM AT ME!! You    This is NOT my fault!! Just should've been at home more     shut up and lemme talk! I'm often!! Why don't you DO        trying to fuckin' talk-- SOMETHING!!! \nALIKE YEAH I'M GAY!! \nArthur spasms as though he's been stabbed. Out of nowhere, Audrey's backhand pistons Alike to the ground. She raises her hand high and slaps it down hard on Alike's shoulders and arms. Alike yells. Arthur turns to stone. \nAUDREY Say it again! Say it again! \nAlike fends off Audrey's blows with her hands. She kicks angrily as Audrey towers over her. \nALIKE I'm a lesbian! Yeah, I'm a dyke. \nAUDREY No you're not!!!!! \nAudrey's blows become more manic and vicious. Arthur wakes from his trance and tries to wrestle Audrey off of Alike. \nARTHUR That's enough! Stop it! \nAUDREY Don't you say that! Let go! Don't you say that! \nALIKE Get offa me!! \nAUDREY What? You a man now? YOU GON' FIGHT ME LIKE A MAN??!! \nAudrey swings and hits Alike with a nasty hook to the jaw, Alike's head snaps back and hits the floor. \nARTHUR AUDREY STOP!!!! \nArthur yanks Audrey off of Alike. Audrey directs her rage at him, pummeling his face and chest. \nAUDREY AND YOU TOO! YOU TOO! YOU TOO! OH GOD!! \nTears stream down Arthur's face as Audrey shakes free and aims one last blow at his face. \nAUDREY (CONT'D) YOU SAY IT'S NOT TRUE!!! \n76   INT. LAURA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                              76 \nClick-clack. Click-clack. The rattle of circuit breakers echo through the bare darkness of Laura's small apartment. \nArthur stops talking but his head remains bowed. An awkward silence ensues. Audrey and Sharonda look up at him still holding hands. \nAUDREY Amen! \nARTHUR Amen. \nAudrey switches to an overly cheery auto-pilot mode, babbling to no one in particular. \nAUDREY I got this recipe from a magazine. Supposed to be very good. And you see I made those green beans you like. Sharonda pass the rice please. \nSharonda, staring at her father doesn't reach for the bowl. \nSHARONDA Dad. You know where she is. \n83   EXT. LAURA'S ROOFTOP - WEEKS LATER                         83 \nAlike and Laura sit at the edge of the roof sharing a quart of mint chocolate chip ice cream. Sunset paints the cityscape pink and orange. The faint cadence of children playing drifts in and out on a fickle breeze. Alike's wounds are healing and she seems happy. The friends exchange wordless smiles and soak in the peacefulness around them. \nLaura hears a noise at the door and gets up to investigate. Arthur is standing in the doorway. Laura calls out to Alike. Alike looks up and the smile fades from her face. Arthur tries to move around Laura, but Laura stares him down. Laura looks back at Alike. Alike considers, then carefully nods. Laura steps out of the way and watches Arthur pass. \nAlike rises to face her father. She stands tall, her weight is centered. Arthur struggles to find her eyes, and she turns away from him. Distant playground voices fill the pause. \nEXT. LAURA'S ROOFTOP - WEEKS LATER \nAlike sits at the edge of the roof writing in her notebook. Laura swings open the door and Alike looks back in greeting, her smile fading as Arthur appears behind her. Laura motions to Alike. Alike considers, then carefully nods. Laura steps aside and watches Arthur pass. \nAlike wanders to the edge of the roof, Arthur follows. Distant playground voices fill the pause. \nALIKE Where's Mom? \nARTHUR She...your mother couldn't make it. \nAlike shakes her head and peers into the rusty skyline. Arthur slumps his hands in his pockets and edges closer. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Remember our old place? Waaay out in Queens? It was our first apartment, we were so proud. Had all those trees around it? In October, the whooole block would be covered with leaves. You remember. \nAlike makes no sign. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) You couldnt've been more than 2 years old. And when the wind would blow, all those leaves would come rushing down the street at us and you thought they were alive. You'd get so scared. You'd cry and you'd scream and beg for us to pick you up. I would try and tell you \"they're only leaves, baby\" and make you stay on the ground. But you were so afraid and you cried so hard, your mother would always pick you up. She always picked you up. \nArthur is silent beneath the weight of his memory. He dares a glance over at Alike. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) `Member how we used to-- \nALIKE I've been accepted into a early college program. Starts in the Spring. Berkeley. \nARTHUR California's a long way away-- \nALIKE Ten weeks writing boot camp, workshops. Then I can start summer semester. \nARTHUR We can talk about that. Okay? \nALIKE I need you to meet with my guidance counselor. Sign the paperwork so I can graduate early. \nARTHUR I'm sorry, alright? I'm sorry I let her hurt you-- \nALIKE I need to know now if you'll sign the papers. Yes or no? \nARTHUR Can you forgive me? \nALIKE Yes or no? \nARTHUR You can always come back home. Things are gonna be different, I promise you-- \nAlike holds Arthur's hand, stopping him. \nALIKE Dad, I'm not running. I'm choosing. \nArthur's heart breaks, he gasps back a sob. \nALIKE (CONT'D) I'm not going back home. \nARTHUR I know. (beat) Okay. \n", "test1_input": "AUDREY Lee... (notices Laura) Oh. Hello Laura, I didn't see you standing there. \nLAURA Hi Mrs. Freeman. \nAUDREY How's your mother? \nLAURA I haven't spoken to her in awhile. She's fine. \nAUDREY Well I hope so. And I'm so glad to hear your sisters finally getting back on her feet. Wasn't she-- \nLAURA She's good. \nALIKE Mom?! \nAudrey fixes Laura with another hard glance and shoos Sharonda down the hallway. Laura starts to shut the door, but Audrey stops it with her arm. \nAUDREY I think we'll just leave this open. Let some air circulate in here. \nLAURA I was just about to leave, anyway. So... \nAudrey lingers, looking back and forth between Laura and Alike. Alike frowns at her mother. \nSatisfied that the conversation is over, Audrey moves off toward her room. Laura checks to make sure she's gone and whispers to Alike. \nLAURA Just try it. \n27   INT. NIGHTCLUB COUCH - EVENING                               27 \nAlike squirms in her seat. \nLAURA Will you chill? You just gotta get used to it. \nAlike tugs at her crotch and attempts to cross her legs. \nALIKE Owwww! \nAlike uncrosses her legs and yanks at her jeans. Laura bats her hand away. \nLAURA Sit still, people gon' think you got something. \nALIKE This joint hurts, man. I'ma go take it off. \nLAURA You not gon' take it off. \nALIKE I'm gonna take it off. \nLAURA Where you gonna take it off at? \nALIKE In the bathroom. \nLAURA Then where you gon' put it? You gonna walk around the club with a dick in your hand? Chill. I knew we shouldn't have done this. You blowin' me right now. \nALIKE Then I'm out. \nLAURA Nah, you're `bout to stay and go through this. You're the one who wanted to meet her, not me. \nALIKE Then you come on, too. Hurry up-- \nA group of girls approaches, one of them we recognize as Mika, the girl that likes Alike, from the bathroom. Laura stands to greet them. Nervous introductions all around. Laura shoots Alike a warning glance. \n28   INT. NIGHTCLUB COUCH - LATER                              28 \nLaura is hugged up with two girls at the end of the couch. Alike fidgets in her seat and keeps pulling at the knees of her jeans. Mika hand in chin, stares into space. Alike does another pull-fidget combo. Mika rolls her eyes at her. \nMIKA You alright? \nALIKE Yeah, no, yeah it's just--there's a spring in the cushion or something. \nMIKA You wanna switch seats? \nALIKE No, I'm good. \nMIKA And you don't wanna dance? \n", "test1_true": "ALIKE No, no not really. I'm not really feeling the music. \nMika sighs and looks around at the other dancing couples. Alike gives her jeans another tortured tug. Agonized minutes of awkward booming silence. \nMIKA Well you don't mind right? I mean you don't mind if I go dance with somebody else? \nALIKE No, do your thing. \nMIKA If you change your mind-- \nALIKE No, no it's cool. \nMika escapes the couch and disappears into the crowd. \n29   INT. ALIKE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                               29 \nAlike slips off her shoes and eases through the kitchen.

ALIKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                 30 \nAlike peels off her jeans and lobs them into the top of her closet. She unharnesses the dildo and wads the tangled mess up in an old t-shirt. She stuffs the wad in back of the closet and slams the closet door shut, staring at her reflection in the mirror. \nAlike reconsiders and yanks the wad back from the closet. \n31   EXT. ALIKE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                               31 \nAlike stuffs the wad into a trash bag and plunges it deep into a neighbor's garbage can. She scurries back into her building and doesn't look back. \n32   INT. ALIKE'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING                           32 \nAlike skulks on the couch in wrinkled khaki pants and a cotton button down shirt. An obnoxious R&B video plays on the TV. Sounds of bustling and the drone of a hair dryer fill the room. \nAUDREY (O.S.) Turn that mess off!! \nAlike turns the television volume to low and continues watching. \nAUDREY (O.S.) Sharonda?! Sharonda are you ready?! Stop lollygagging! \nSHARONDA (O.S.) I'm coming! \nAUDREY Lee are you ready?! Lee?! \nAudrey hobbles out with one high heel on. She snatches the remote from Alike and snaps the TV off. \nAUDREY (CONT'D) I said off. Thought you were ready? \nALIKE I am ready. \nAUDREY You're not going to church looking like that. Where's the blouse I bought you? \nALIKE What's wrong with this? \nThe front door bursts open, and Arthur tromps in, his police uniform hanging open over a white undershirt. He slings a heavy F.O.P tote bag on the floor and strips off his shirt as he crosses to the kitchen. Audrey rushes over and buzzes around him. \n33   INT. ALIKE'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS                         33 \nAUDREY Hey there, you're home early--well actually late. I thought you would have called-- \nALIKE Dad-- \nARTHUR Do what your mom says. \nAudrey scuttles over to where Arthur is now digging through the open fridge. He pulls out a foil covered plate, tears open one corner, sniffs it. \n", "test1_id": 1437, "test2_input": "37   INT. LAURA'S BEDROOM - DAY                                    37 \nALIKE (V.O.) Hi! This is Lee, I'm not able to answer my phone right now-- \nLaura snaps her cell phone shut. A GED study book still glossy and uncreased is propped open on the bed in front of her. She opens her cell phone again and pulls up Alike's number. Her thumb hovers over the `talk' button. She snaps the phone shut and tosses it aside before turning the radio down and dragging the book closer. The cell phone rings and she snatches it up. A picture of a girl making a kissy face with the name \"Tasha\" underneath blinks onto the screen and Laura snaps the phone shut and tosses it aside. She hoists the GED book into her lap and lets her head hit the wall. There is a knock at her bedroom door and Candace peeks in. \nCANDACE How's it comin'? \nLAURA It's good. \nCandace smiles at Laura and hesitates before closing the door. Candace turns the radio off before ducking back out. Laura sighs and flips back to the beginning of the book. \n38   INT. SPORTS CLUB BASKETBALL COURT - DAY                       38 \nAlike and Arthur cavort in a sloppy half-court game in the fluorescent glare of the gym. Well-heeled clientele cross to and fro munching power bars and sipping Gatorade. Arthur has an awful shot, but Alike's is worse. Alike heaves a huge airball past the basket. \nARTHUR Oh my God!! \nAlike cracks up as Arthur chases down the ball. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) That's just embarrassing! \nALIKE You ain't got no range, either. \nARTHUR Yeah but at least I hit the backboard. Damn. \nAlike rushes to guard Arthur who dribbles clumsily around the key. He tries a crossover move and lobs an ugly shot toward the basket. \nALIKE Brick!! \nLaughing, they tussle over the rebound. Arthur recovers. \nARTHUR What's the score? \nALIKE One up. \nARTHUR One? \nALIKE Yup! \nARTHUR One? Nah, I definitely have like three. At least three. \nGiggling, the pair rollick in another squeaky-shoed play. \n39   INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT                                    39 \nMACK, the store proprietor leans against the counter flipping through a newspaper. Arthur, in uniform mulls through the sports section. A ratty looking man, SOCK sips from a red plastic cup. \nMack cranks the volume on the tiny television above the counter. \nMACK It's on again... Check it out Free. Channel 5 and Channel 2. \nArthur appears on the TV screen, dressed in suit, tie, sunglasses and looking impressive. He is talking to a news reporter and a bad news graphic reading \"East Side Drug Bust-- Detective Arthur Freeman\" blots out the bottom of the screen. \nSOCK Look who's big time. \nMACK Brother was looking clean though. Looked just like, look like...uh-- Danny Glover! \nArthur and Mack laugh and slap hands. Sock sneers at their revelry. \nThe bell over the door tinkles and a heavyset BUTCH WOMAN strolls in. Her head is shaved and a thick wallet chain clinks against her ample carpenter pants. All three men turn to stare. \nMACK (CONT'D) Been more of that since they opened up that new club `cross the way. \nArthur grunts and returns to his paper. \nSOCK (to Butch Woman) Excuse me Miss??!! Miiiiissss??!! \nMACK Certain Friday nights they got, you know special parties going on. \nSOCK Or should I say Sir??!! Siiiir??!! Hello?!! \nARTHUR Chill out, Sock. \n", "test2_true": "Mack snatches Sock's cup. Sock pivots around to protest. \nSOCK Hey!! \nMACK Mind your business. \nSock yanks his cup back and turns to resume his taunts. He's caught off guard and stumbles backward as the woman pushes up to the counter with a case of liquor. Arthur steps out of the way and observes. \nBUTCH WOMAN And a pack of Kools. \nMack nods and fishes under the counter. \nSOCK Say, I been trying to get your attention. Do you go by Sir or Miss? \nMACK That'll be all ma'am? \nBUTCH WOMAN Yeah. \nSOCK Look I just had a simple question I wanted to ask. See, I just want to know how does pussy taste? \nThe woman directs her full attention at Sock for the first time. Mack watches as he quickly punches in the sale. Arthur stiffens. \nSOCK (CONT'D) You know, I just wanna know if you go with women for the taste, or is it just you're too big, black, and ugly so don't no man want you? \nSock laughs at his own nasty joke and takes a sip from his cup. \nMACK $65.07 ma'am. \nThe woman counts out the money and smiles at Sock. \nBUTCH WOMAN I can't lie, pussy do taste good. \nSOCK Oh yeah? \nThe woman takes her time putting away her change. \nBUTCH WOMAN (CONT'D) Maybe you should try it yourself sometime. Or better yet-- \nThe woman picks up her case. \nBUTCH WOMAN (CONT'D) --ask yo' wife how she likes me! \nThe woman winks at Sock. Arthur chokes back a guffaw. As soon as the woman clears the door, Arthur and Mack explode in laughter. Sock is livid and screams after her. \nSOCK Fuckin' Bulldagger! He-She! Dyke! \nMACK Ask your wife! \nARTHUR She told you. \nSOCK She ain't tell me shit! I don't know what the fuck y'all niggas are laughing for! \nMACK Awww shut up. Your big mouth got you in trouble as usual. \nSOCK Thought you was my friend, Mack. But I guess I ain't expect you to defend me Free, the way your daughter is-- \nArthur slams Sock against the counter before he can finish his sentence. \nARTHUR Say what?! \nMACK He don't mean nothin'! He don't know what he's talking about! \nArthur grinds Sock's collar tighter around his trembling fist. Sock glares back, clearly punked. \nMACK (CONT'D) He ain't moved outside a two-mile radius of where he crawled out his mammy's pussy. He don't know shit. \nSOCK (to MACK) I been to Poughkeepsie! \nArthur snorts and flings Sock loose. \nMACK Carry your Poughkeepsie ass on out of my store! \nMack sweeps Sock's plastic cup off the counter and into a garbage can. Sock tromps to the door. \n", "test2_id": 1438, "test3_input": "I'ma look his ass up in the system. Ha-ha! Wait `till your mama finds out. She'll be so goddamn happy. \nAlike plays along, swallowing her disappointment. \nALIKE Yeah. \nArthur pushes back from the table and pulls a fresh police uniform out the hall closet. He lays it across the back of the couch and unzips his pants. Alike turns her back to give him privacy. \nARTHUR Say uh--there's this new--uh women's club up there by the liquor store--have you--do you--you haven't heard anything about it, right? \nAlike shakes her head no. Arthur tucks his undershirt into his pants. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Called the Kitty Litter, the Catbox, something like that? \nALIKE Nah, I never even heard of it. \nARTHUR Good. `Cause you know that's a uh...it's a rough neighborhood. You know that right? I had a case over there. You wanna be careful--stay away from that element. Just in case it ever comes up? \nALIKE I'll be careful. \nARTHUR Good. I know you will. \nAlike glances back at Arthur and sees that he's decent. She scoots back around to face him. Arthur smooths his uniform shirt into his pants. \nALIKE Dad, when you were on the phone earlier? It sounded like...I mean...I guess you're headed back to work, huh? \nARTHUR Yep. Your mama still up? \nALIKE Probably. \nARTHUR Tell her I had to work. \nArthur picks up his work tote and kisses Alike on the forehead. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Love you. \n56   INT. LAURA'S KITCHEN - MORNING                            56 \nLaura jams a pillow into a t-shirt as a makeshift pillowcase as she escorts one of the pier girls to the couch. The pier girl looks slightly unkempt and is relieved to plop her knapsack on the floor. Laura tosses the pillow onto the couch. \nLAURA My sister gets home at six so, you gotta be gone by then. \nPIER GIRL #2 Good looking. \nLAURA There's some lunchmeat in there too, help yourself. \nPIER GIRL #2 `Preciate ya. \nLaura pulls up close to the kitchen table. The GED test prep book, now dog-eared and worn is on the table in front of her. \nShe finds her place and copies notes and multiple choice answers into a spiral notebook. A stack of old Math and English textbooks are in a chair next to her and the room is peaceful and still save for the scratching of her pencil. \n57   INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - AFTERNOON                           57 \nAlike spies on Bina stuffing books into her locker. She draws her breath and approaches. \nALIKE Hey. \nBINA Hey. \nA long awkward silence. Alike leans against the bank of lockers, not daring to make eye contact. \nALIKE I'm sorry about the other day. \nBINA It's cool. \nBina pretends to rearrange books in her locker. \nALIKE (CONT'D) Things have been crazy. But look, I'm sorry I bugged out. It's just...I didn't know that you...I wasn't expecting that. \nBINA You still coming to the party? \nALIKE I don't know--I need to try and catch up with Laura. \n", "test3_true": "ALIKE But I do wanna hang out...I mean...maybe we could do both. \nBina smiles and shuts the locker door. \nBINA Cool. (beat) You could spend the night if want to. Avoid the whole curfew thing. \nALIKE Yeah... \nBINA You sure? \nALIKE Yeah. \n58   INT. FAMILY CAR - DAY                                        58 \nArthur coaches Alike as she navigates the car to a jerky stop in front of Mack's liquor store. \nARTHUR Easy, easy now. Watch your right hand side. \nALIKE I am. \nARTHUR Don't ride the brakes though. Good. \nALIKE See? I'm getting better!! Can I drive back? \nArthur rubs his chest in mock heart-attack. \nARTHUR I don't about that. You're shaky girl, you're shaky. Get us some chips and I'll think about it. \nArthur hands Alike a five dollar bill and she bounces down out of the car. \n59   EXT. LIQUOR STORE - CONTINUOUS                               59 \nArthur shouts a greeting to Mack who lounges on a plastic chair outside his door. Sock and TWO OTHER MEN chit chat nearby. Their chatter lowers as Arthur approaches. Alike bops into the store. \nMACK Hey, baby! \nALIKE Hey Mr. Ferguson! \nMACK I see Alike's been running circles around you again! \nARTHUR Little bit, little bit. I still got it though. \nArthur claps Mack on the shoulder and glimpses Sock whispering to one of the men. \nArthur follows the men's gazes over to Alike at the potato chip rack. She twirls the string of her basketball shorts round and round her finger and idly hikes the collar of her t- shirt up over her nose. The smile evaporates from Arthur's face. \nSock peers back at him, smirking. Arthur starts toward him, when Alike saunters out between them. \nARTHUR We better get going. \nMACK (CONT'D) Gone already? \nARTHUR I'll holler at you later. \nArthur crosses the lot in a bound, snatches the car keys from Alike's hand, and hustles her into the car. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Get in the car. \nALIKE But you said I could drive-- \nARTHUR I said get in the car! \nAlike frowns, then catches sight of the men in front of the store. She slumps into the car and slams the door. Arthur piles into the driver's seat. They sit in silence for a moment, Alike traces the lines in her hands. \n60   INT. ARTHUR'S CAR - CONTINUOUS                               60 \nARTHUR Look...umm...you know you're daddy's girl, right? \nAlike avoids eye contact, staring out her window. Arthur searches her face a moment longer, then starts the car and pulls away in silence. \n61   INT. ALIKE'S APARTMENT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                   61 \nAudrey reclines on the couch reading a book.

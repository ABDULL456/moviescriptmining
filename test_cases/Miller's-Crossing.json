{"train": "MILLER'S CROSSING -- by Joel and Ethan Coen \nMiller's Crossing \nAn Original Screenplay By \nJoel Coen \nand \nEthan Coen \n1.   FADE IN: CLOSE SHOT   A WHISKEY TUMBLER \nThat sits on an oak side bar under a glowing green bankers lamp, as two ice cubes are dropped in.  From elsewhere in the room: \nMan  (off) I'm talkin' about friendship.  I'm talkin' about character.  I'm talkin' about--hell, Leo, I ain't embarassed to use the word--I'm talkin' about ethics. \nWhiskey is poured into the tumbler, filling it almost to the rim, as the offscreen man continues. \n. . . You know I'm a sporting man.  I like to make the occasional bet.  But I ain't that sporting. \nTHE SPEAKER \nA balding middle-aged man with a round, open face.  He still wears his overcoat and sits in a leather chair in the dark room, illuminated by the offscreen glow of a desk lamp.  This is Johnny Caspar. \nBehind him stands another man, harder looking, wearing an overcoat and hat and holding another hat--presumably Caspar's.  This is Bluepoiont Vance. \nCaspar (cont'd) When I fix a fight, say--if I pay a three-to-one favorite to throw a goddamn fight--I figure I got a right to expect that fight to go off at three- to-one.  But every time I lay a bet with this sonofabitch Bernie Bernheim, before I know it the odds is even up--or worse, I'm betting the short money. . . \nBehind Caspar we hear the clink of ice in the tumbler and a figure emerges from the shadows, walking away from the glowing bar in the backgound. \n. . . The sheeny knows I like sure things.  He's selling the information I fixed the fight.  Out- of-town money comes pourin' in.  The odds go straight to hell.  I don't know who he's sellin' it to, maybe the Los Angeles combine, I don't know.  The point is, Bernie ain't satisfied with the honest dollar he can make off the vig.  He ain't satisfied with the business I do on his book.  He's sellin' tips on how I bet, and that means part of the payoff that should be ridin' on my hip is ridin' on someone else's.  So back we go to these questions--friendship, character, ethics. \nThe man with the whiskey glass has just passed the camera and we cut to the: \nREVERSE \nAnother well dressed, middle aged man, behind a large polished oak desk, listening intently.  This is Leo.  He is short but powerfully built, with the face of a man who has seen things. \nThe man with the whiskey enters frame and passes Leo to lean against the wall behind him, where he listens quietly. \nCaspar . . . So its clear what I'm sayin'? \nLeo Clear as mud. \nCaspar purses his lips but continues unfazed. \nCaspar It's a wrong situation.  It's gettin' so a businessman can't expect no return from a fixed fight.  Now if you can't trust a fix, what can you trust?  For a good return you gotta go bettin' on chance, and then you're back with anarchy.  Right back inna jungle.  On account of the breakdown of ethics.  That's why ethics is important.  It's the grease makes us get along, what separates us from the animals, beasts a burden, beasts a prey.  Ethics.  Whereas Bernie Bernheim is a horse of a different color ethics- wise.  As in, he ain't got any.  He's stealin' from me plain and simple. \nLeo leans back in his chair. \nThe man behind Leo raises the whiskey glass to his lips. \nHe is trimmer and younger than Leo, perhaps in his thir- ties, dark-complected, with a pencil mustache and a gaunt intensity that is not entirely healthy-looking.  This is Tom. \nAs he drinks, he studies Caspar and Bluepoint. \nLeo You sure it's Bernie, selling you out? \nFor the first time the man behind Caspar speaks: \nBluepoint It ain't elves. \nLeo Nobody else knows about the fix? \nCaspar No one that ain't got ethics. \nLeo What about the fighters you pay to tank out? \nBluepoint We only pick fighters we can put the fear of God in. \nLeo Any other bookies know?  You play anyone else's book? \nCaspar I lay an occasional bet with Mink Larouie. \nBluepoint But it ain't Mink, I'll vouch for that. \nLeo How do you know? \nCaspar shakes his head. \nCaspar It ain't Mink.  Mink is Bluepoint's boy. \nLeo Mm.  And of course, Bluepoint always knows about the fix. \nBluepoint What the hell is that supposed to mean? \nLeo Let it drift.  All it means is a lot of people know. \nCaspar I guess you ain't been listening.  Sure other people know.  That's why we gotta go to this question of character, determine just who exactly is chiseling in an my fix.  And that's how we know it's Bernie Bernheim.  The Motzah Kid. 'Cause ethically, he's kinda shaky. \nLeo You know Bernie's chiseling you because he's a chiseler.  And you know he's a chiseler because he's chiseling you. \nAirily: \nCaspar Sometimes you just know. \nLeo . . . So you wanna kill him. \nBluepoint For starters. \nLeo nods, thinking.  He swivels to look interrogatively at Tom. \nTom gives an almost imperceptable shrug.  The ice cubes in his glass clink. \nLeo turns back to Caspar, pauses. \nLeo . . . Sorry, Caspar.  Bernie pays me for protec- tion. \nTom, peering over his drink, does not entirely conceal his surprise. \nCaspar stares at Leo, his mouth open.  It is not the response he expected. \nCaspar . . . Listen, Leo, I ain't askin, for permission. I'm tellin' you as a courtesy.  I need to do this thing, so it's gonna get done. \nWith a whoosh of rustling leaves the wind gusts a fedora into frame.  For a moment it lies still in the foreground, sunlight rippling over it, making it seem almost alive. Then the wind picks up again and the hat tumbles away from us, end over end, in slow motion into the background, impossibly far away until . . . it dissappears. \nAs we fade out, we hear a distant knocking. \n3.   FADE IN: CLOSE SHOT   TOM \nUnshaven, eyes closed, motionless. \nThe head credits continue over this one-shot scene. \nThe knocking continues, faintly, offscreen.  As we hear a door opening we pull back to a looser shot, revealinq that Tom is slumped back on a tired green sofa. \nA fat hand enters to shake Tom's shoulder. \nVoice Wake up, Tommy. \nWithout ocening his eyes: \nTom I'm awake. \nVoice You're eyes were shut. \nTom Who're you gonna believe? \nTom sits up, though it seems like an effort.  He looks sick. \nFrom a small mirror behind the couch we see that we are in the back room of a gambling establishment.  The leavings of a card game litter a table in the middle background. \nTom . . . How'd I do? \nVoice What do you think.  You're a millionaire.  You gonna remember your friends? \nTom reaches up to feel his head, and looks stupidly about. \nTom . . . Where's my hat? \nVoice You bet it, ya moron.  Good thing the game broke up before you bet your shorts. \nAfter a beat of staring at nothing in particular, Tom abruptly lurches to his feet and staggers out of frame. \nThe other man sits heavily onto the couch that Tom has just vacated.  He is Fat Tony, a big man wearing an apron. \nHe watches as we hear Tom, offscreen, staggering across the room, bumping into something which scrapes and then clatters over, opening a door, staggering across tile, and then vomiting. \nFat Tony watches with mild interest. \nFinally: \nTom's Voice . . . Who left with my hat? \nTony Verna.  Verna and Mink. \nTom . . . Who? \nLouder: \nTony Mink and Verna. \nOffscreen we hear a tap running. \nTom . . . Thunderclap running tonight? \nTony Yeah. \nTom What's she leave at? \nTony Three-to-one, more'n likely.  Lay off, Tom.  You shouldn't go deeper in the hole. \nTom Tell Lazarre I want five hundred on the nose. \nTony shrugs. \nTony You would have it. \nTom . . . Somebody hit me? \nTony Yeah.  Mink hit you. \nTom . . . Whyzat? \nTony inspects a hangnail on his thumb. \nTony You asked him to. \n4.   CUT TO: A HALLWAY \nA loose shot looking over Tom's shoulder as he knocks on an partment door.  Head credits continue. \nThe door swings open and Verna, an attractive but hard- looking woman in her late twenties or early thirties looks coldly out at Tom. \nTom (still slightly woozy) Miss me? \nVerna You again.  What now? \nTom I want my hat. \nVerna . . . Is that all you came for? \nTom Yeah.  I want my hat. \nVerna I won it.  It's mine. \nTom What're you gonna do with it? \nVerna Drop dead. \nShe slams the door. \nThere is a long, motionless beat.  Tom raises his hand and knocks again, missing the door completely on his first try. \nAfter a knock or two the door swings open again. \nTom I need a drink. \nVerna Why didn't you say so. \nHe nods to himself. \nShe's a little wild, but she's okay.  I like her. \nTom smiles. \nTom Yeah, you like her.  Like the Kaiser likes cabbage.  You're dizzy for her. \nLeo scowls at Tom. \nLeo What of it?  Jesus, Tom, ain't you ever been bit by that bug? \nTom Leo, if she's such an angel, why are you looking for her at four in the morning? \nLeo digs his hands into his pockets and slouches back, profoundly embarassed. \nLeo I put a tail on her this afternoon. \nTom Hah! \nLeo Yeah, I asked Rug Daniels to follow her around-- just, you know, just to keep her out of trouble. \nTom And to tell you what trouble she was managing to whip up herself. \nLeo It wasn't to spy, Tom; I was worried.  After that meeting with Caspar, well--you can't be too careful. \nTom Uh-huh.  And what did Rug tell you that has you scurrying over here? \nLeo That's just it.  Nothing.  He's disappeared. \nTom laughs humorlessly. \nTom So you've lost your ladyfriend and the tail you put an her. \nLeo I guess it does sound pretty sorry at that. . . \nHe looks from his empty glass up to Tom. \n. . . Help me out, Tom.  I wouldn't know where to start looking.  You know Rug's crowd, you know the people Verna runs with.  I'm just worried now, with things the way they are between me and Caspar-- \nTom gives a wave of disgust. \nTom You shouldn't be confronting Johnny Caspar, it's what I've been trying to tell you.  You can't trade body blows with him.  He's gotten too strong. \nFor the first time Leo displays some testiness: \nLeo I reckon I can still trade body blows with any man in this town. . . \nHe sighs, looks back down at his drink. \n. . . Except you, Tom. \nTom And Verna. \nLeo smiles good-naturedly. \nLeo Okay, give me the needle.  I am a sap, I deserve it. . . \nHe stands and walks to the door. \nTom doesn't move.  His eyes remain fixed on the chair Leo has just vacated. \nLeo pauses in the open doorway. \n. . . Thanks for the drink.  Let me know if you hear anything. . . \nThe door closes and he is gone. \nTom grimaces and stands up.  Sunlight is just starting to come in through the windows, defining for the first time the corners of the large semi-circular room as Tom walks across it to the bedroom.  Distant early-morning traffic noise is filtering up from the street. \n7.   INT  BEDROOM \nAs Tom opens the double oak doors and enters, leaving them open. \nHe crosses to the bed and sits an its edge, hunched forward, thinking.  Behind him, a woman stirs. \nWoman (sleepily) Who was that? \nTom Leo. . . \nHe takes a cigarette from the nightstand and lights it. \n. . . He's looking for you. \nVerna stiffens. \nVerna Did you tell him I was here? \nTom No. \nVerna relaxes. \nVerna Did you put in a good word for my brother? \nTom No. \nVerna You said you would. \nTom . . . I said I'd think about it. \nVerna What did you tell him? \nTom is lost in thought.  He exhales smoke. \nTom . . . Did you see Rug Daniels last night? \nVerna No.  What did you tell Leo? \nTom finally turns to face her.  After looking at her for a beat: \nTom . . . I told him you were a tramp and he should dump you. \nA shoe flies past his head and hits the wall behind him. \nVerna You're a son of a bitch, Tom. \nTom Leo's upstairs getting ready to shoot himself in the foot on your account. \nVerna I don't know what you're talking about. \nTom He's gonna go to the mat for your brother.  And it's gonna hurt him. \nVerna I don't know Leo's business, but he's a big boy. \nTom He used to be. \nVerna causes with the lipstick.  She looks at Tom intently but her tone softens. \nVerna Look.  What do you want, Tom?  You want me to pretend I don't care what happens to Bernie? Well I do.  He's my brother and I don't want him to get hurt.  If Leo wants to help him out I'll step out with him, show him a good time in return.  There's no harm in that. \nTom There's a name for that kind of business arrange- ment. \nVerna I'll do what I have to for Bernie and there's no reason for you to try and queer that.  Regardless of what you think of me, Bernie's a decent guy. \nTom A straight shooter, huh?  A square gee? \nVerna Yeah, sneer at him like everyone else.  Just because he's different.  People think he's a degenerate.  People think he's scum.  Well he's not. \nTom Poor misunderstood Bernie. \nVerna swivels around to stare quizzically at Tom. \nVerna . . . What is this about?  You want me to stop seeing Leo . . . Why don't you just say so? \nTom I want you to quit spinning Leo in circles and pointing him where to go. \nVerna I forgot--that's your job, isn't it? \nTom I'll do what I have to to protect Leo.  I'm asking you--politely, for me--to leave him alone. I don't have to ask.  If I told him about our little dance last night, your pull would dry up pretty fast. \nNow Verna is irritated: \nVerna So would yours.  I don't like being threatened. \nTom I don't like being played for a sucker.  That game might work with Leo but it won't work with me. \nVerna You think last night was just more campaigning for my brother? \nTom I can see the angles. . . \nHe grabs her by the arm and drags her roughly to her feet. \n. . . And I know if there was a market for little old ladies, you'd have Grandma Bernheim first on line. \nVerna (struggling to get out of his grasp) You're a pathetic rumhead. \nTom And I love you, Angel. \nTom takes her hat off, tosses it onto the chair, and kisses her roughly on the lips. \nVerna breaks away and socks him on the jaw.  Tom staggers back, upsetting a table of toiletries and landing against a banquette. \nHe throws his empty whiskey glass at Verna. \nShe ducks and it smashes into the mirror. \nThey stand staring at each other for a beat, breathing hard.  Tom has a smear of lipstick near one side of his mouth. \nFinally: \nVerna. . . . I suppose you think you've raised hell. \nShe picks up her stole and heads for the door. \nTom stands staring at her back, swaying, ever so slightly. \nTom Sister, when T've raised hell you'll know it. \n16.  CUT TO: INT   TOM'S APARTMENT \nA wide shot, facing the semi-circular windows, the door of the apartment behind us.  A large easy chair in the middle foreground faces away from us: a smaller chair is at the window end of the room, facing us. \nAt the cut we hear the ringing of the telephone. \nOffscreen we can hear the unhurried scrape of a key in the lock, then the door opening, then the door closing. \nTom's back enters frame as he strolls into the room and then disappears briefly through an open doorway to the right.  We hear an icebox door opening and closing, and then Tom reenters again, still not reacting to the insis- tently ringing phone.  He is now holding a balled-up towel. \nHe walks over to the facing chair at the window end of the room, shrugs off his overcoat, drapes it on the chair, sits, crosses his legs, takes off his hat, tosses it onto the upraised toes of his crossed leg, tilts his head back, and presses the towel against his forehead--apparently it is an icepack. \nWe are beginning to track slowly towards him. \nAfter a beat he takes out a cigarette, lights it, and reaches back for the phone that refuses to stop ringing. \nTom Yeah. . . \nHe casually looks forward, just off to one side, at a specific point in space.  He does not react to whatever he is hearing. \n. . . I need a couple days. . . Because I don't have it now. . . \nWe are almost in close shot now.  His gaze is still fixed and emotionless. \n. . . Because I say so. . . What would be good enough?. . . Well, if it'll make him feel any better, tell Lazarre he can send someone by to break my legs.  I won't squawk. \nHe prongs the earpiece, still looking off.  The track has stopped in close shot.  He exhales a stream of smoke, then after a beat: \n. . . 'Lo, Bernie. \nREVERSE \nSlouched in a chair, in the corner of the room, facing Tom, is Bernie Bernheim.  He is about thirty and wears his overcoat and hat and a good-natured smile.  He holds an apple in one hand and a paring knife in the other.  The long peel of the apple corkscrews down off the knife. \nBernie 'Lo, Tom.  What's the rumpus? \nTom C'mon in, make yourself at home. \nBernie Yeah, you weren't here so I thought I'd do that. Didn't wanna answer the phone, though.  Figured it wasn't for me. \nTom Uh-huh. \nAfter a silent beat, Bernie chuckles. \n. . . What you eat for lunch? \nJohnny Jr. A hot dog. \nCaspar Just a hot dog? \nThe boy shakes his head. \nJohnny Jr. A hot dog and mustard. \nCaspar throws his head back and roars with laughter. \nCaspar A hot dog with mustard!  A hot dog with mustard! You hear that, Bluepoint!  The kids as smart as a whip!  Even Uncle Bluepoint thinks that's funny. \nBluenpoint's face is a solem mask. \n. . . Whadduz the goddamn doctor know! \nCaspar wipes away tears of mirth and digs in his pocket with his left hand.  Extending two closed fists towards the boy: \n. . . G'head, which hand is the penny in? \nThe boy touches his right fist. \n. . . Choose again. \nThe boy just looks at him. \n. . . Okay, here ya go.  Take the penny.  Shiny new penny. \nTo his wife. \n. . . Take the kid.  Wait in the car.  Give'm a penny, boys. \nTic-Tac and Frankie dig in their pockets for change as the boy and his mother cross to the door. \nFrankie I ain't got a penny, boss. \nCaspar has turned his attention to a check book that lies on the table in front of him.  As he writes: \nCaspar Ah, well, that's a penny ya owe him.  'Lo Tom, what's the rumpus?  You like kids? \nTom No. \nAbsently: \nCaspar Uh-huh.  Have a seat.  G'ahead. \nHe tears out the check. \n. . . Well, you're missin' out on a complete life.  I know, kids, big deal, but still, I'm tellin' ya. \nHe blows on the check. \n. . . Anyway. . . Thanks for comin' by.  I just wrote this check out to your bookmaker, Lazarre. It's for an even fifteen hundred, which is more than I hear you owe him but I figure you can always use some money on the cuff, a high roller such as yaself whaddya say? \nTom . . . Thanks. \nCaspar laughs. \nCaspar Always the yapper, huh?  Well, you're welcome. You wanna know why I'm putting you square with Lazarre? \nTom Not particularly. \nCaspar Bad feeling.  It ain't a good thing.  It's a poison, kid.  I want everybody to be friends.  I do this, you're friends with Lazarre, he's friends with you, and you're friends with me. And all you gotta do, show you're a friend, is to give me Bernie Bernheim.  You know it's the right thing anyway; I can't keep any discipline if I can't punish the people I need to punish.  The Motzah steals from me, I can't have Leo givin' him a shiny new penny. . .  You find some way to make Leo understand that. \nTom So the deal is, I give you the Motzah, smooth it over with Leo, and you bail me out with Lazarre. \nCaspar Yeah, then we're all friends again: You, me, Leo, Bluepoint. \nBluepoint sneers from the couch: \nBluepoint We can maybe have tea sometime. \nCaspar C'mon, Bluepoint.  Friends is a mental state. Wuddya say, kid? \nTom . . . I'll think about it. \nCaspar He'll think about it.  Hear that, Bluepoint? That's terrific.  The kid's a thinker. \nBluepoint Does he want a pillow for his head? \nCaspar Okay kid, think about it.  It's a mental state. But make it quick, my family's waitin'. \nTom I'll think about it and tell you later. \nBluepoint He needs to think in the thinking room. \nCaspar shakes his head sadly. \nCaspar Kid, if it'll help you think, you should know that if you don't do this you won't be in any shape to walk outa here. \nTom considers this. \nTom . . . Would that be physically, or just a mental state? \nCaspar stares at him for a beat, then slowly starts to tear up the check. \nCaspar . . . That ain't friendly, kid.  I make you a nice offer, I get the high hat. \nHe gets up and walks over to the door.  Tic-Tac opens it for him and precedes him out. \nBefore following Caspar out the door, Bluepoint grins at Tom. \nBluepoint Too bad for you, smart guy. \nHe leaves, shutting the door. \nThe room is quiet. \nTom looks at Frankie, the large man, who looks back. \nFrankie stands, takes off his suit coat, and hangs it carefully on a rack by the door. \nHe approaches Tom. \nTom Leo'll do what suits him, and you'll do what he tells you.  Last I heard Leo's still running this town. \nO'Gar He won't be for long if this keeps up.  It's no good for anyone--you said as much yourself. \nTom First off, O'Gar, I can say what I please to Leo and about him. . . \nHe taps him on the chest. \n. . . You can't.  Second, once Leo decides-- that's that.  And if that sticks going down, there are plenty of other coppers wouldn't mind being chief, and could swallow it clean. \nO'Gar looks chastened. \nO'Gar Jesus, Tom, I was just speculatin' about a hypothesis.  I know I don't know nothin'.  It's just a damn mess is all-- \nHe is interrupted by gunfire from an upper story of the facing building. \nO'Gar's men react, finding cover, returning the fire. \nO'Gar unholsters his gun as he and Tom scramble for cover. \n. . . a goddamn mess. \n23.  HALLWAY \nWe are shooting over Tom's shoulder as he knocks at the door to Verna's apartment. \nAfter a beat, Verna opens the door. \nOn seeing who it is she starts to swing the door shut. \nTom puts his toe in the doorway and leans into the door. \nAs he pushes his way in: \nTom Thanks, don't mind if I do. \n24.  INT   APARTMENT \nAs Verna gives up and Tom enters. \nVerna walks over to the phone.  As she dials, Tom tosses his hat onto a chair and checks the apartment to see if they're alone. \nVerna Hello, officer, I'd like to report an intruder at 346 West-- \nTom grabs the phone away from her. \nTom Who's this?. . . 'Lo, Shad, Tom Duchaisne here. We won't be needing any today. . . That's right, my mother.  She didn't recognize me.  Lemme talk to Mulvaney. \nHe takes a flask out of his packet and looks across the room towards Verna. \n. . . Miss me? \nVerna Drop dead. \nWe hear a voice barking through the line and Tom turns back to the phone. \nTom . . . 'Lo Sean, tell O'Car to send a car over to Leo's tonight.  If we're going to be banging away at Caspar we ought to be ready for him to bang back. . . Yeah. \nHe hangs up the phone and tips the flask back, draining the last drop. \nVerna What do you want? \nTom is crossing to the bar. \nTom I was in the neighborhood, feeling a little daffy.  Thought I'd drop in for an apperitif. \nHe pours himself a drink. \n. . . Rug Daniels is dead. \nVerna Gee, that's tough. \nTom Don't get hysterical.  I've had enough excitement for one nigit without a dame going all weepy on me. \nVerna I barely knew the gentleman. \nTom Rug?  Bit of a shakedown artist.  Not above the occasional grift, but you'd understand that.  All in all not a bad guy, if looks, brains and personality don't count. \nVerna You better hope they don't. \nHe gives her a sick grin. \nTom . . . Yeah well, we're none of us the saint I hear your brother is. \nVerna Who killed him? \nTom Leo thinks Caspar did. \nVerna But you know better. \nTom I do now.  Caspar just tried to buy me into settling his tiff with Leo, which held hardly do if he was waging war.  So I figure you killed him, Angel.  You or Saint Bernard. \nVerna Why would I--or my brother--kill Rug Daniels or anybody else? \nTom Rug was following you.  He knew about you and me. That wouldn't help your play with Leo, would it? \nHe looks at her.  She holds his gaze. \nVerna You think I murdered someone.  Come on, Tom, you know me a little. \nTom Nobody knows anybody--not that well. \nVerna You know or you wouldn't be here. \nTom Not at all, sugar.  I came to hear your side of the story--how horrible Rug was, how he goaded you into it, how he tried to shake you down-- \nVerna That's not why you came either. \nTom shrugs. \nTom Tell me why I came. \nVerna looks at him. \nVerna The oldest reason there is. \nRAT-TAT-TAT-TAT--the hems of their coats sway as they fire. \nThe floorboards in front of us are pocked by bullet hits that walk across the floor towards the bed and hit the mattress. \nThe mattress above us dances under the gunfire as ticking sprays down at the floor. \nSmoke curls up throuch the floorboards. \nLEO \nJaw clamped on his cigar, he starts firing. \nHIS POV \nBlood spurts as one gunman takes a hit in the ankle. \nHe staggers and his tommy gun clatters to the floor. \nLEO \nStill firing. \nHIS POV \nThe other gunman is ducking out the door. \nThe injured gunman pitches forward, head towards us, his hat rolling off. \nLEO \nFiring. \nHIS POV \nA bullet hit in the top of the fallen man's head. \nLEO \nRolling out from under the bed. \nHe stoops to pick up the dead man's tommy gun.  Thick smoke seeps up through the floor. \nThe phonograph plays. \nLeo ducks through another door. \n28.  HALLWAY \nFacing down the length of the dark hallway, towards the mouth of the stairs. \nAs Leo leaps across frame in the foreground, to enter a facing room, muzzle flashes erupt at the end of the hall-- where the other gunman has been waiting in the darkness. \n29.  SECOND ROOM \nLeo throws open a window. \n30.  EXT \nAs Leo rolls out onto the long sloping eave of a front porch. \nHis gun skates down the eave and falls.  Leo grabs the rain gutter, hangs by his hands and drops down to the front lawn. \nThe first floor of the house is in flames. \nFrom a high angle the camera swoops down on Leo as he picks up the gun and backs away from the house, looking up at the second story.  His open robe flaps in the breeze.  The dead cigar is still clamped between his teeth. \nLEO'S POV \nThe second floor window that he just emerged from. Staccato gunfire erupts in the dark room. \nThe strobing gunfire makes a strobing shadow of the gunman, whose back is to us as he rakes the room with fire. \nLEO \nFiring, the gun jumping and bucking in his hands. \n29.  INSIDE THE ROOM \nThe gunman, riddled with bullets and showered with broken glass, spins around, his thompson still firing uncontrol- lably. \nBullets dance across the walls and ceiling, blast out the remaining glass and sing harmlessly into the trees outside. \nBACK TO LEO \nAs we hear the screech of skidding tires.  A black coupe takes a curve on the street behind him, machine gun fire spitting out of the back window. \nLeo turns, in the glow of the fanning flames, walking calmly into the street, firing at the receeding car. \nON THE CAR \nGrowing smaller, still snitting fire and lead. \nPULLING LEO \nStill walking calmly up the street, the gun still bucking in his hands.  Bullets whistle by and claw up the pavement around him. \nBEHIND LEO \nHis robe whips back in the breeze.  He fires again and we hear the distant sound of shattering glass.  The car weaves, runs up off the road, hits a tree and bursts into flame. \nA figure emerges from the car and staggers off into the darkness.  He is on fire. \nCLOSE ON LEO \nAs he stops, squinting, raising the gun. \nHIS POV \nThe burning gunman zig-zagging into the darkness. \nBACK TO LEO \nA faint smile curls around the cigar.  He drops the muzzle of the gun. \nLeo Huhh. . . \nAbsently: \nLeo Course he did. \nTom No.  Think about it.  Just this one time.  Who was Rug following? \nThis gets Leo's attention.  He turns to look at Tom. \nLeo . . . Huh? \nTom It needn't have been that sinister.  A strange man, following her down a dark alley, late at night. . . I've told you, Leo, she can take care of herself. \nLeo stares at Tom.  He seems somewhat dazed. \nLeo . . . Tom, why're you saying that?  Christ, Tom. I just told you, I plan to. . . \nTom They pulled a .22 slug out of him.  A pop gun, Leo--a woman's gun. \nLeo . . . That's a whiskey dream.  Verna wouldn't panic--shoot someone--just because he was following her. \nHe gazes off again, shaking his head. \n. . . No. . . It wouldn't have happened that way in the first place, and if it had she would have told me. . . I know you don't like her, Tom, but I trust Verna as much as I trust you. \nTom On her account you'll burn the town down. \nLeo Don't worry, Tom.  We'll still be standing when the smoke clears. \nTom's tone is gentle: \nTom Okay Leo.  Then maybe it wasn't that innocent. Maybe Rug knew something she didn't like him knowing, and wouldn't want you to know.  He was following her.  He knew who she was seeing.  He knew where she was sleeping, and who with. . . \nLeo has taken his feet off the sill and has turned back to face Tom.  He studies him carefully. \nLeo Maybes don't make it so. \nTom's suddenly very earnest, almost beseeching. \nTom They're more than maybes.  You've trusted me before, and never lost anything by it.  Trust me on this. \nLeo This is too important. \nTom I don't ask much, and I don't ask often.  Trist me on this. \nLeo Tommy-- \nTom Trust me on this or the hell with you. \nLeo You don't mean that. \nTom . . . She was at my place.  The night Rug was following her; the night you dropped by. \nLeo is still staring impassively at Tom.  Tom doesn't flinch from his gaze. \nAfter a long beat Leo gets up slowly from his chair, walks over to the window, shoves his hands in his pockets and gazes out. \nFor a moment Tom looks at Leo's motionless back, but he has nothing left to say.  He rises, plucks his hat from the desk and goes to the door.  Before exiting, he looks back. \nLeo, in long shot, is still gazing out the window. \nTom exits. \n33.  HALLWAY \nPulling Tom up the hall. \nBehind him we can see the door to Leo's office opening and Leo coming out.  He strides up the hall after Tom. \nTom turns as Leo reaches him. \nLeo, without breaking stride, seems to walk right into him, throwing a punch that catches Tom on the chin and sends him stumbling back, his hat flying off. \nThe men 1ining the hall watch with casual interest. \nTom staggers into one of the men who catches him.  Another man has picked up Tom's hat and now hands it to him.  The first man shoves Tom back into the middle of the hall just in time for the approaching Leo to land another punch against his jaw. \n34.  This blow sends Tom rolling down the staircase, still clutching his hat. \nLeo is clomping down the stairs; his army of private retainers clomp down behind him.  In his shirtsleeves and chomping an unlit cigar, Leo looks like a labor leader taking the rank and file to the barricades. \nTom claws himself up the wall to his feet. \nLeo has reached the floor and still without breaking stride uppercuts Tom with a blow that straightens him up and sends him staggering like a drunk into gamblers in evening dresses and tuxedos. \nA path clears for Leo and his entourage.  He has not slackened his pace, but is also not hurrying.  Tom weaves, watching Leo approach, but makes no attempt to defend himself. \nLeo grabs his own wrist with one hand and swings his elbow up to catch Tom with a sharp blow on the side of his face. \nTom spins into a screaming lady in a sequined evening dress and sinks to the floor grabbing at her bodice and skirt for support.  She bats at him with her handbag as he slips down. \nFat Tony emerges from the crowd and helps Tom to his feet. He raises his hand to stop Leo. \nTony Okay, Leo.  I'll throw him out. \nLeo stops, panting.  He is looking at Tom, but speaking to to Tony. \nLeo . . . Yeah.  Do that. . . It's the kiss-off.  If I never see him again it'll be soon enough. \n35.  CUT TO: TOM'S APARTMENT \nWide shot of his living room, facing the windows.  It is night. \nTom sits with his back to us at the window, feet propped up on the sill.  He is smoking a cigarette.  A full ashtray on a table at his side indicates that he has been sitting there for some time. \nWe are slowly tracking in. \nThe telephone sits on the the arm of his chair.  After a moment he stubs out the cigarette, picks up the phone and dials. \nTom . . .'Lo Frankie its Tom, how's the flunky business?. . . I've had worse; your ventilator healing up? \nOffscreen we hear a knocking at the door to the apartment. Tom ignores it. \n. . . Tell Caspar its already forgotten.  I'd like to see him. . . \nThe knocking continues. \nVerna The Royale.  Room three-oh-two. \nShe gazes off. \n. . . I guess we both double-crossed Leo, there's no getting around that.  I guess he's well rid of both of us. \nTom Mm. \nVerna The two of us, we're about bad enough to deserve each other. \nTom Are we? \nVerna We're a couple of heels, Tom.  Yes we are. \n37.  PULLING TOM \nInto a dark office.  Behind him, Frankie, his nose swathed with bandages, is closing the door from the outside. \nCaspar (off) 'Lo, Kid.  You know O'Gar. . . \nTOM'S POV \nCaspar sits behind his desk.  Bluenoint sits slouched on a couch to one side, wearing his hat, his hands jammed into the pockets of his overcoat. \nIn two chairs facing the desk, away from us, sit two men who are twisting around to smile at Tom. \nCaspar . . . and the mayor. \nTom 'Lo, boys. \nMayor Tom's a big booster.  Always has been. \nCaspar S'fine, s'fine.  Well, Tom and me's got the proverbial fat to chew-- \nThe mayor and O'Gar are already rising to their feet. \nMayor Well, let us know if you need anything. . . \nCaspar Yeah, happy days.  Have a seat, kid. . . \nTom sits into one of the vacated chairs facing Caspar. \n. . . So you had enough time to think about it? \nTom Yeah, well, circumstances have changed. \nCaspar Don't I know it.  Last night, I know Bluepoint was disappointed the bulls showed up before Frankie and Tic-Tac could really pin your ears back, but I said, Relax, Bluepoint, I got a feeling about this kid.  Take the long view.  The kid and Leo are gonna go bust-o.  If the kid ain't ready yet, well, he soon will be.  Matter of time.  I said, the kid's too smart for Leo. That's what I said.  Like a psychic.  Ask Bluepoint if I didn't.  Like a goddamn psychic. G'ahead.  Ask him. \nTom turns to look at Bluepoint. \nTom You vouch for this psychic business? \nFrom the couch, Bluepoint sneers: \nBluepoint That's right, smart guy. \nCaspar cheerfully continues, oblivious to any hostility in the room: \nCaspar I know you knew protecting the Motzah was a dumb idea.  I know you been wise to all of Leo's dumb ideas lately.  Only a matter of time.  Bust-o. \nHe chuckles. \n. . . That's why last night we didn't put the arm on you.  Only Leo. \nTom Seeing how you squiffed your play on Leo, I can be only so grateful. \nBluepoint That's brave, coming from Little Miss Punching Bag. \nCaspar C'mon Bluepoint.  Friends now, huh? \nBluepoint Nuts. \nCaspar smiles at Tom. \nCaspar So we get a little jingle.  And I figure you know Leo's on his way out.  It's only a matter of time before we get him.  Am I right, kid? \nTom Maybe. \nCaspar laughs. \nCaspar What maybe.  You know or you wouldn't be bust-o. So I guess you're looking for a job? \nTom I might be. \nCaspar laughs. \nCaspar You got references?  You been to college, kid? We only take yeggs what's been to college.  Ain't that right, Bluepoint? \nBluepoint says nothing.  His scowl is set in cement. \n. . . I'm jokin', of course.  We all know you can be useful to us, a smart kid such as yaself, the man who walks behind the man and whispers in his ear.  I guess you could be useful, in spades. \nTom Yeah.  I can do plenty for you.  But the fact is that right now Leo's still got all his vital signs and once he hears about this he'll be more anxious to get to me than to either of you. \nCaspar I'm tellin' ya not to worry about Leo.  We got plans for him. \nTom Yeah?  What? \nBluepoint Not so fast there, Kaputnik. \nThere is a beat through which Caspar continues to smile at Tom. \nCaspar . . . I think what the Bluepoint is trying to say is, there'll be time to talk about that.  That can be tabled for a later date.  See, the last time we jawed you gave-me the high hat.  So I guess I'm sayin', maybe we want your confidence before we give you ours.  You gotta put somethin' on the table.  Ante up. \nTom Fair enough.  Where shall we start. \nCaspar Hear that, Bluepoint?  All business!  I told you he was a good kid!  Where shall we start!  All business!. . . \nHe rocks back in his chair and dries his eyes.  Tom smiles pleasantly.  Finally Caspar sighs. \n. . . Well, we could start for instance with the Motzah. . . Like where's the Motzah?  You could maybe tell us that. . . \nTom The Royale.  Room three-oh-two.  You might find Mink with him. \nBluepoint The hell you say. \nCascar looks at Tom and smiles. \n. . . Kids.  Ya gotta be firm.  Anyways.  You know what I'm sayin'.  No reason to worry but no reason not to investigate, neither.  If Mink is around I want you to find him.  He can tell us what's what. . . (to Johnny Jr.:) . . . What's a matter, somebody hit you, what's a matter, we ain't friends anymore?. . . \nHe picks up Johnny Jr., who is crying softly, and sets him in his lap.  Encouraged by the attention, the child starts wailing.  Caspar bounces him on his knee and raises his voice over the sobs: \n. . . If you find him, I wanna talk to him alone. That's how you get the straight dope.  Man-to- man.  Just me, Mink. . . \nHe pats his jacket where his shoulder holster is. \n. . . and my friend roscoe.  Y'understand what I'm sayin'? \nTom takes a contemplative drag on his cigarette. \nTom . . . It ain't complicated. \n44.  CUT TO: CLOSE SHOT   A MAN'S FACE \nCrunch!--being hit by a gloved hand. \nThe blow and the man's grunt echo. \nCLOSE ON A NEWSPAPER \nAs the noise of fists against flesh continues, echoing, in the background. \nThe newspaper headline reads: PARTY BOSS LOOSES MUNICIPAL CONTRACT.  The subhead reads:  Liam (Leo) O'Bannon Removed From City Highway Commission;  New Construction Contracts To Raffo Bros. \nON TOM \nLeaning against a pillar in a large bare room with a hardwood floor.  He is reading the newspaper. \nWe are in a gym.  In a ring in the background two boxers are sparring as two or three old men with towels slung over their shoulders and elbows hooked over the ropes idly watch, and offer occasional bits of half-hearted advice. \nWe hear high heels echoing across the floor and Verna enters. \nTom You should leave town for a few days; things are going to heat up here.  Go out to the Pallisades; I'll join you once I'm done. \nVerna . . . I can't find Bernie.  Did you find him? \nTom looks out at the fighters in the background, avoiding Verna's look. \nTom . . . Yeah. \nVerna Is he leaving? \nTom He left. \nVerna Where to? \nTom . . . He didn't say.  You should-- \nShe reaches out to touch his hand-- \nVerna Thanks. \nShe leans in to embrace him. \nTom's eyes drift up to the fighters. \n45.  EXT   THE GYM \nPeeling paint on its blackened-out window reads: Gleason's Gym.  Training in The Sweet Science. \nVerna is exiting the gym in long shot. \nWe pull back to bring Bluepoint into frame.  He sits in the driver's seat of a car, watching through his side window as Verna recedes.  Quietly: \nBluepoint What's he up to? \nAn offscreen voice, a passenger: \nVoice I dunno. \nBluepoint That's Bernie's sister, isn't it? \nVoice I dunno. \nBluepoint thinks, a short beat. \nBluepoint What's he seeing her for? \nVoice I dunno, maybe he's-- \nBluepoint Shutup.  Get outta the car.  Stick with the bighead. \nBluepoint reaches for the ignition, as we hear the car door open. \n. . . I'll see where the twist flops. \n46.  CUT TO: INT   SPEAKEASY \nA hand swings through frame holding the barrel of a gun, smashing the butt into a surprised face. \nWith a loud crash the surprised man stumbles back into a table and hits the floor.  Legs and the skirts of an overcoat approach the prostrate, round, middle-aged man and start kicking him. \nHe rolls across the floor trying to shield himself from the blows. \nVoice (off) C'mon, get up.  I just wanna talk. \nAnother Voice (off) Yeah, get up.  He ain't gonna hurt ya. \nRound Man He already hurt me!  He broke my goddamn nose! \nWhisper, the man standing over him, has a long scar across his neck.  He has a rasping voice: \nWhisper So what?  I had my nose broke once. \nRound Man I already paid Leo's men. \nBert, another enforcer, is down at the end of the bar with Tom. \nBert You still pay Leo for protection?  Is he protec- tin' you? \nAs he kicks at the little round man: \nTRACKING TOWARDS BERT \nBert . . . Up there!  Leo's-- \nA hail of bullets cuts him to pieces.  A limp rag, he hits the road. \nThe police car squeals to a halt in front of his corpse.  A sergeant and his men pile out. \nTom is sauntering over, smoking a cigarette. \nSergeant 'Lo, Tom.  Chalk one up for the good guys, huh? \nTom Yeah, Caspar'll be thrilled.  You just shot one of his apes. \nSergeant Bullshit! \nTom's attention is drawn by something down the street. \nHIS POV \nAbout a block away, a man with white hair is crossing the street, from the side where the sniper's shot came from. \nSergeant (off) I'm tellin' you that's Two-Toe Jackson!  He's Leo's! \nBACK TO TOM \nAs he starts to leave. \nTom It's Bert Sachetti, Caspar's bang-man. \nBehind him the Sergeant bellows at another cop: \nSergeant Bullshit!  Take his shoes off.  Count his goddamn toes! \n48.  INT   DINER \nDead Terry McGill sits at a stool looking angrily down at a cup of coffee.  Tom enters to sit next to him. \nThrough the windows behind them, we can see people running back and forth on the street, a fire engine racing past-- furious activity, its noise muted inside the diner. \nTom 'Lo, Terry.  You weren't aiming at me, were you? \nTerry does not even look over at him.  Sullenly: \nTerry In the first place, I don't know what you're talking about.  In the second place, if I had been aiming at you I'd've hit you.  In the third place, I don't know what you're talking about in the first place. \nHe tosses some coins onto the counter and gets up.  We hold on Tom as Terry talks to Tom's back: \n. . . I'd like to have, believe me.  Leo won't let me--yet.  But I'll bring him around. \nHe puts a hand on Tom's stoulder and swivels him around. Terry clenches a fist and draws it back to throw a punch. \nTom and Terry look at each other, Tom making no movement to defend himself. \nAfter a long beat, Terry uncldnches his fist and sneers: \n. . . I won't give you the satisfaction. \n49.  CUT TO: DOORKNOB \nAs--CRASH--a foot enters to kick it and the door in. \nINT   VERNA'S APARTMENT \nVerna is backing away from the door--behind us--into the apartment.  Bluepoint strides into frame. \nBluepoint Know who I am? \nVerna continues to back away; Bluepoint continues to advance. \nVerna Yeah, Johnny Caspar's shadow.  Did he stay in bed today? \nBluepoint Jesus.  I open my mouth, the whole world turns smart. . . \nHe glances around the room.  Verna is backing around the couch.  Bluepoint continues to follow her. \n. . . What business d'you have with Tom Duchaisne? \nVerna None. \nShe continues to back away; Bluepoint continues to follow. \nBluepoint You're Leo's twist, right? \nVerna Me and Leo are through. \nShe picks up her purse from the sill behind the couch and rummages.  Bluepoint doesn't seem to mind. \nBluepoint Yeah?  So you're sluttin' around with Tom now, huh? \nVerna has taken a gun from her purse; she levels it at Bluepoint. \nVerna Get outta here. \nAs he continues to stride towards her: \nBluepoint Okay, see ya later. . . \nHis hand shoots out in a flash--he has grabbed the gun with one hand, her arm with the other. \n. . . Before I go, what's your boyfriend up to? \nVerna is stuggling in his grasp to no effect. \nVerna Nothing I know about. \nBluepoint drags her close, nose to nose: \nBluepoint Yeah?  It doesn't figure for me, your dumping Leo for the guy who put a bullet in your brother. \nVerna stops resisting and stares at him. \nBluepoint stares back at her, thinking. \n. . . Didn't tell you, huh? \nBernie Your other friends wouldn't break in, huh? \nTom shakes his head. \nTom My other friends wanna kill me, so they wouldn't knock. \nHe crosses to the chair facing Bernie's. \n. . . What's on your mind, Bernie? \nBernie Things. . . I guess you must be kind of angry. I'm supposed to be gone, far away.  I guess it seems sort of irresponsible, my being here. . . \nBernie leaves room for a response but Tom is only listen- ing. \n. . . And I was gonna leave.  Honest I was.  But then I started thinking.  If I stuck around, that would not be good for you.  And then I started thinking that. . . that might not be bad for me. \nTom still doesn't answer. \n. . . I guess you didn't see the play you gave me.  I mean what'm I gonna do?  If I leave, I got nothing--no money, no friends, nothing.  If I stay, I got you.  Anyone finds out I'm alive-- you're dead, so. . . I got you, Tommy. \nTom is silent. \n. . . What's the matter, you got nothin' to crack wise about?  Bernie ain't so funny anymore? \nBernie's lip is quivering.  His voice is softer: \n. . . I guess I made kinda a fool a myself out there. . . I was shittin' myself, Tommy. . . you didn't tell anyone about that. \nTom No. \nBernie 'Course you know about it. . . its . . . It's a painful memory.  And I can't help remembering that you put the finger on me, and you took me out there to whack me. . . I know you didn't. . . I know you didn't shoot me. . . but. . . but-- \nTom But what have I done for you lately? \nBernie Don't smart me. \nHe stares hard at Tom for a moment. \n. . . See, I wanna watch you squirm.  I wanna see you sweat a little.  And when you smart me, it ruins it. \nBernie gets to his feet, keeping the gun trained on Tom. \n. . . There's one other thing I want.  I wanna see Johnny Caspar cold and stiff.  That's what you'll do for your friend Bernie. . . \nHe has opened the door to the flat. \n. . . In the meantime I'll stay outa sight.  But if Caspar ain't stiff in a couple of days I start eating in restaurants. \nThe door shuts behind him. \nTom, heretofore very still, springs from the chair, goes to the bedroom and reemerges with a gun. \nHe bolts for the door, instinctively grabbing his hat off a hook.  He is wearing only his boxer shorts, a sleeveless tee-shirt, and the hat jammed onto his head. \nHe throws open the door. \n52.  HALLWAY \nEmpty. \nTom runs to the bannister and looks down. \nHIS POV \nA flight down, a hand slides down along the railing. Bernie's trotting footsteps echo in the stairwell. \nTOM \nHe runs back to his apartment. \n53.  APARTMENT \nTom runs across to the open window and clambers out. \n54.  FIRE ESCAPE \nTom trots down.  His bare feet ring dully against the steel of the fire escape. \nHe reaches the bottom landing, swings over the railing, hangs by his hands for one brief moment and then drops. \nTHE ALLEY \nAs his bare feet hit the pavement.  Tom is a silhouette in the lamplight from the end of the alley. \nHe straightens from his crouch and runs. \nBACK DOOR \nOf his apartment building--over Tom's shoulder as he enters frame.  The empty, brightly lit hall inside runs straight the length of the building to the front door, which is just closing. \nTom throws open the back door. \n55.  HALLWAY \nAs Tom runs through toward the front. \nBefore reaching the door, he falls violently forward. \nHis gun skates away from him across the floor. \nHe starts to roll over to look behind him and a crunching blow catches him on the chin, snapping his head the rest of the way around and sending him flat onto his back. \nBernie, who has emerged from under the staircase, towers over him. \nBernie You make me laugh, Tommy.  You're gonna catch cold, then you're no good to me. . . \nHe is walking over to Tom's gun, which he picks up and unloads into his hand. \n. . . What were you gonna do if you caught me, I'd just squirt a few and then you'd let me go again. \nHe tosses Tom the empty gun and walks out. \nTom, white-faced and shivering, pulls himself up to sit leaning against the wall. \nA first-floor apartment door opens and a sixty-year-old woman emerges, pulling a housecoat tight.  She goggles at Tom. \nTic-Tac Hop in, Tom, we been lookin' for you. \nStill briskly walking: \nTom I'm busy. \nTic-Tac Hop in anyway, as in you ain't got no choice. \nTom You can't hijack me, Tic-Tac, we're on the same side now--or didn't you get that far in school? \nThe car screeches over to put a wheel on the sidewalk and block Tom's way.  The back door swings open and Frankie emerges to help Tom in.  Like Tic-Tac, Frankie looks a little worked over. \nTom quickly sizes up the situation and decides to comply. \n60.  INT  CAR \nAs Tom sits into the back, next to Bluepoint.  Frankie slides in after him. \nBluepoint How'd you get the fat lip? \nThe car starts moving. \nTom Old war wound.  Acts up around morons. \nBluepoint Very smart.  What were you doing at the club? Talking things over with Leo? \nTom Don't think so hard, Bluepoint, you might sprain something. \nBluepoint You're so goddamn smart.  Except you ain't.  I get you, smart guy, I know what you are. Straight as a corkscrew.  Mr. Inside-Outsky. Like a goddamn bolshevik, picking up your orders from Yegg Central.  You think you're so goddamn smart. \nHe sneers: \nYou joined up with Caspar.  You bumped Bernie Bernheim.  Down is up.  Black is white.  Well I think you're half-smart.  I think you were straight with your frail and queer with Johnny Caspar.  And I think you'd sooner join the Ladies' League then gun a guy down. \nHis eyes narrow at Tom. \n. . . Then I hear that these two geniuses never even saw this rub-out take place. \nDefensively: \nTic-Tac The boss just said have him do it, he didn't say nothing about-- \nBluepoint Shutup, or maybe you still got too many teeth. \nTic-Tac sulks.  Bluepoint turns and gazes out the window of the car. \n. . . Everyone's so goddamn smart.  Well, we'll go to Miller's Crossing.  And we'll see who's smart. \n61.  EXT   WOODS \nIt is morning; the sun is now fully up.  Bluepoint and Tom walk side-by-side through the woods.  Frankie and Tic-Tac walk several steps ahead of them, each off to one side, searching.  Frankie is singing an old Neapolitan song. \nBluepoint Y'understand if we don't find a stiff out here, we leave a fresh one. \nTom walks a little unsteadily.  His shoulders are hunched and his hands are jammed into his overcoat packets.  He stares woodenly forward.  Bluepoint laughs softly. \n. . . Where're your friends when you need 'em, huh?  Where's Leo now? \nTom tramps mechanically on.  His eyes drift up. \nHIS POV \nTracking.  A canopy of leaves, sprinkled by sunlight. The boughs of the trees sough quietly in the wind. \nWe hear the unearthly groaning of the tree limbs. \nTOM \nLooks forward. \nBluepoint calls out: \nBluepoint Hey Tic-Tac, ever notice how the snappy dialogue dries up once a guy starts soiling his union suit? \nTom tramps on. \nHIS POV \nThe backs of Frankie and Tic-Tac as they walk on ahead. \nFrankie is still singing. \nTOM \nHe looks stupidly at Bluepoint.  He looks ahead. \nHe stops abruptly. \nBluepoint What? \nTom is still for a moment, then with jerky movements gets down on his knees, hugs a tree with one arm for support, and vomits. \nBluepoint watches him, then calls out to Frankie and Tic- Tac: \n. . . Okay, there's nothing out here. \nHe grabs Tom's hat off his head and flings it away.  Then he plants a foot against Tom's side and shoves him to the ground. \nCLOSE ON TOM \nAs his face hits the ground. \nBluepoint's foot enters; he plants it an the side of Tom's neck to keep him pinned. \nTOM'S POV \nSkewed angle, from the ground. \nFrankie is ambling back, singing. \nBLUEPOINT \nChecking the open chamber of his gun.  He snaps it shut. \nAs he levels the gun at Tom: \nTom A good feeling, huh.  When did the feeling return to your head? \nDrop . . . Huh? \nTom puts the hat on top of Drop's head.  Drop's eyes roll up to look at it, but otherwise he still doesn't move. \nThe hat, too small, sits ludicrously atop his head. \nTom starts toward the door. \nTom You've outgrown that one.  Must be all the thinking you've been doing. . . \nHe pauses with his hand on the knob. \n. . . Tell Bernie something's come up.  He has to get in touch.  There'll be nothing stirring til I talk to him. \nHe slams the door. \n65.  CUT TO: A LARGE WINDOW \nWe are looking at the ground-floor window from the street. Letters stencilled on the glass identify the SONS OF ERIN SOCIAL CLUB. \nA topcoated man scurries into frame, knocks out a pane with the grip of a gun, and tosses a small pipelike device inside.  He scurries away and we pan with him across the street to reveal a line of cars, police and civilian, parked along the far curb.  No men are visible except the scurrying man, who takes cover behind one of the parked cars. \nSOCIAL CLUB \nA beat.  From inside we hear a pair of trotting footsteps-- \nBOOM!  The window blows out, spitting glass into the street, along with a large dark form. \nTHE STREET \nGlass showers the pavement and a charred rag-doll of a body hits hard, face down, and skids a couple feet.  Smoke wisps from it. \nTHE CLUB \nA lick of flame from the bomb is already dying and heavy grey smoke is billowing out. \nTHE STREET \nMen start cautiously rising from behind the cars.  A lot of men.  Some wear police uniforms; some are civilians.  All are armed. \nTHE CLUB \nBillowing smoke. \nTHE STREET \nThe men have straightened up.  A policeman calls through a bullhorn: \nPoliceman All right.  Anyone left in there, come on out, grabbing air.  You know the drill. \nTHE CLUB \nAfter a beat, the front door swings open.  A man emerges, one hand in the air, one holding a handkerchief over his mouth. \nHe walks into the middle of the street. \nOne of the civilians behind the cars fires. \nThe man takes the bullet in the chest and drops to the ground, where he twitches. \nThe man who fired, in the foreground, grins.  A ripple of laughter runs down the line of men. \nTHE CLUB WINDOW \nSmoke still pouring out. \nWith a RAT-A-TAT-TAT muzzle flashes from inside illuminate the smoke. \nTHE STREET \nBullet hits chew up the cars and a few of the men; the others drop back down behind the cars and start returning fire. \nTHE WINDOW \nA forbidding black hole in the exterior wall.  A second tommy has joined the first to pour lead out into the street. \n66.  CUT TO: RECEPTION AREA \nTracking in an a youngish secretary in a severe dress, sitting behind a desk. \nFaintly, from a distance, we can still hear gunfire. \nSecretary 'Lo, Tom, where've you been hiding? \nREVERSE \nOn Tom. \nTom Hither and yon.  The mayor in? \nSecretary With Mr. Caspar. \nTom is already heading for the door. \nTom That's who I'm looking for.  Scare up some hootch, will you honey? \nSecretary Surely.  I'll announce you. \nAs he opens the door: \nTom Don't bother, I'm well liked. \n67.  INT    MAYOR'S OFFICE \nA grand, high-ceilinged place.  Mayor Levander sits behind his desk sputtering, his face turning purple.  Caspar, sitting across from him, is also turning purple.  Sitting to one side are two identical thirty-year-old men, appar- ently twins, mustachiced, silent, respectful, mournful, their hands clasped over the hats in their laps, wearing stiff new-looking suits with old-fashioned collars. \nMayor I can't do it, Johnny!  I'll look ridiculous! Why, it simply isn't done!  Assistants, maybe-- \nCaspar For a mayor, you don't hear so hot!  I said head! Head of the assessor's office! \nMayor But there's two of 'em! \nCaspar I can count!  Co-heads! \nTom laughs bitterly. \nTom Sure, talk to him.  Have a chat.  Ask him whether he's selling you out.  Don't take care of him before he makes his next move, just sit back and let him make it.  You're swimmin' in it. \nCaspars eyes flash.  Tom's tone softens: \n. . . Johnny, my chin's hanging out right along side yours. \nCaspar goes slack. \nCaspar Yeah. \nTom stands up. \nTom . . . I'd worry a lot less if I thought you were worrying enough. \nCaspar, miserable, rubs his face.  From the distant street, we hear another booming explosion. \nCaspar . . . But I am, kid. . . Christ. . . running things. . . \n68.  CUT TO: TOM'S APARTMENT \nThe phone is ringing at the cut. \nWe are looking at the window sill upon which the phone sits, with an empty chair facing. \nFootsteps approach and Tom sits into frame and takes the phone. \nTom Yeah? \nThrough the phone: \nVoice I got your message. \nTom 'Lo, Bernie, I had a dream about you the other day. \nWe hear Bernie laugh. \nBernie . . . Yeah?  A nightmare? \nTom On the contrary; very sweet.  I dreamt you were lying out at Miller's Crossing with your face blown off. \nMore laughter. \nBernie . . . You get a kick out of that? \nTom I was in stitches.  It's Mink, isn't it? \nBernie I came back and he wasn't happy to see me.  Can you beat that, Tom?  All he could taik about was how he had to skip, and how much trouble he'd be in if anyone found me at his place. \nTom Some friend. \nBernie Yeah.  And you know what a nervous boy he was.  I figured, hell, you're a friend.  Maybe you could use some insurance. \nTom That's you to the gills, Bernie: thoughtful.  You didn't happen to keep his gun, did you? \nAfter a moment's hesitation: \n. . . Didn't Mink have a .22? \nBernie Held already ditched it.  Why? \nAnother hesitation: \nTom . . . After Rug? \nBernie Yeah. . . How did you know? \nDown to business: \nTom Doesn't matter.  Listen, Bernie, I've been thinking about our little deal and I've decided you can stick it in your ear. \nBernie . . . Huh? \nTom I figure you don't have anything on me that I don't have on you.  As a matter of fact, less, since I've decided to leave town. So I'm calling your bluff. \nBernie Wait a minute-- \nTom Shutup and let me talk.  I'm pulling out of here, tomorrow morning.  The only thing for you to decide is whether or not I leave behind a message for Caspar that you're still around.  If you want me to keep my mouth shut, it'll cost you some dough. \nBernie You can't-- \nTom I figure a thousand bucks is reasonable.  So I want two thousand. \nBernie In a pig's eye-- \nTom This isn't a debate, it's instructions.  I'm going out for a while; I'll be back here at four this morning.  Bring me the money.  If you're not at my place, four o'clock, with the dough, Caspar'll be looking for you tomorrow. \nHe hangs up. \n69.  CUT TO: HALLWAY \nWe are close on Tom as, in overcoat and hat, he emerges from his apartment and looks down at the keys in his hand. \nWHAP--A fist swings into frame to connect with Tom's cheek. He falls back. \nThree topcoated men loom over him. \nFirst Man Got any money? \nTom is massaging his face. \nTom . . . No. \nThe first man nods at the other two. \nFirst Man Okay. \nThe two men pick Tom off the floor and start to work him over.  He doesn't resist. \nThe first man watches dispassionately. \n. . . Third race tonight.  By the finish, Tailor Maid had a view of the field. \nHe lights himself a cigarette. \n. . . 'Ats what I'm tellin' ya. It contracts. 'At way you get a first class shave. \nDriver Okay, Johnny. \nAs Caspar walks off the driver slouches back, pulls his fedora over his eyes and folds his arms across his chest. A back enters frame in the foreground. \nTom's Voice: 'Lo, Sal.  You can dangle. \nThe driver looks up, startled. \nDriver 'Lo, Tom.  You sure?  You don't look so hot. \nWe still don't see Tom's face. \nTom I'm okay.  Go ahead, I'll drive him home. \nThe driver shrugs. \nREVERSE \nWider, from the other side of the car, as the car pulls away. \nTom walks into the foreground, toward his house; we tilt up to hold him. \nThe low-angle shows us the tree behind Tom, its branches still creaking in the wind. \nCrack crack--we hear two gunshots from inside the house. \nTom stops momentarily in close shot, looking up, and then continues on out of frame. \n75.  OVER TOM'S SHOULDER \nWe follow him as he walks into the building and slowly down the first-floor hall. \nThe hallway is quiet excent for a light moaning wind. \nBeyond Tom we see the door to the first-floor apartment crack open a slit.  Hissing: \nVoice Mr. Duchaisne. . . \nThe door opens wider.  Mrs. Zarpmas, wearing a housecoat, her gray hair down in braids, sticks her head out. \n. . . There were shots. \nTom looks up towards the staircase, then back at Mrs. Zarpas. \nTom Go down to the drugstore.  Call the police. \nShe stares at him, nods.  As she drapes on a raincoat: \nMrs. Zarpas Yes, Mr. Duchaisne. \nTom You better stay there til the officers arrive. \nMrs. Zarpas Yes . . . \nShe pauses. \n. . . Will the cats be all right here? \nTom stares at her. \nFinally, he nods. \nTom . . . They'll be fine. \nMrs. Zarpas returns his dazed nod, and shuffles away. \nSo far, upstairs, all is quiet. \nPULLING TOM \nAs he starts slowly towards the staircase. \nTOM'S POV   TRACKING FORWARD \nA small black object on the staircase--an upside-down fedora.  Blood drips with a hollow rattle down onto a step, a couple steps above the hat. \nPULLING TOM \nHe looks up. \nPOV \nA head sticks through the balusters of the second story landing return.  The body is on its back; the head lolls back over the tip of the landing down towards the stair- case. \nOur climbing low angle shows us mostly the back of the head.  The body's far shoulder has knocked out a baluster whose splintered bottom juts down towards the stairs. \nPULLING TOM \nStill climbing, looking at the body. \nHIS POV \nClimbing and panning as we draw even with the head. \nIt is Caspar.  Blood has been expelled through his nostrils over his mouth and chin.  His face is deep red.  His eyes stare glassily at Tom. \nPULLING TOM \nAs he reaches the top of the stairs and swings around to face along the landing.  We hear a chuckle, close by.  Wind is groaning through the hallway. \nPOV \nIn the middle foreground Caspar lies an the floor; beyond him, Bernie leans against the doorframe in Tom's open doorway, smiling, his arms folded over his chest. \nThe balusters stretch away in a regular line, throwing vertical shadows upwards against the opposite wall. \nBernie I get it.  You set me up. \nTom leans against the wall and looks morosely down at Caspar. \nBernie . . . Anything to avoid a little dirty work yourself, huh? \nTom doesn't answer. \nHe sinks to his knees, his voice rising. \n. . . Jesus Christ!  It don't make sense!  Tommy! Look in your heart! \nTom What heart. \nBANG--Bernie splays backwards from the knees, a bullet drilled neatly through his forehead. \nTom drops the gun by Caspar's body. \nUnpocketing Bernie's gun, Tom goes over to his corpse and drops it there. \nWe pan with Tom's legs to bring his doorway into view as he walks into his apartment, to the window chair in the background, and sits with his back to us. \nThe windows show daylight breaking.  Far away a clock strikes the quarter hour. \nTom is picking up the phone and dialing.  Waiting for an answer, he reaches over to turn off the feeble yellow lamp burning chairside. \nAs we start to FADE OUT, we can hear Tom talking into the phone: \nTom . . . Tony?  Tom.  Tell Lazarre I've got his money. . . Yeah, all of it.  And I want to place a bet on tonight's fight. . . \nA BEAT OF BLACK \n76.  CUT TO: THE HALLWAY \nOf Leo's club, leading to his office. \nWe are tracking over Tom's shoulder as he walks down the hall, led by Dead Terry. \nTerry They set you up downstairs? \nTom How's that? \nTerry Hootch?  Whatever? \nTom gestures with the drink he is carrying.  Its ice cubes clink. \n. . . Well thanks for coming, Tom.  Leo's real anxious to see you. . . \nTom Yeah.  I happened to be near. \nWe can hear muffled bellowing coming from Leo's office, growing louder as we approach. \nTerry seems embarassed: \nTerry Actually. . . this might not be the best time. . . \nThey have pulled up in front of the closed door to Leo's office. \nLeo's bellowing, inside, abates for a moment.  We can hear another voice, muffled so that we don't hear words, but only the voice's plaintive quality. \nLeo's bellowing cuts it short. \nTom . . . Who's he got in there? \nTerry O'Gar and the mayor. \nAs he leaves frame: \nTom I'll try again. \nTerry calls after him: \nTerry I'll tell him you stopped by. \n77.  DOWNSTATRS \nPulling Tom as he walks across the gambling floor, drink still in hand. \nBehind him we can see workmen busily repairing the damage done to the club in the police raid. \nHalfway across the floor Tom stiffens and slows, seeing something. \nVerna is entering the club. \nThe two meet. \nTom 'Lo, Verna. \nVerna See Leo? \nThey both lean against a counterstop and look out at the floor. \nTom He was busy. \nVerna You should see him.  He has something to tell you. \nTom Maybe I'll run into him. \nVerna Bernie's funeral is tomorrow.  You could stop by. \nTom Maybe. \nVerna . . . Leo has something to tell you. \nTom So you said. \nThere is a silent beat.  Verna scowls. \nVerna . . . Tell me something, Tom.  Why didn't you tell me what was going on?  I thought he was dead, and you never-- \nTom There was no point in telling you.  It could only have queered things if it had gotten out-- \nVerna Jesus, Tom!  You don't just talk to people for the play it gives you or doesn't give you!  I suffered, you no-heart son of a bitch! \nTom lets this drift. \nVerna tries to compose herself. \n. . . I'm sorry.  It's just that things might've been different.  With us.  If I'd known that you hadn't. . . done anything to him. . . \nTom You know now. \nVerna looks at him intently. \n", "test1_input": "Tom Well I'm right here, and I'm not made of glass. \nMink Yeah, but he's nervous walkin' around in public. He's a right guy, but he's nervous, Tommy!  He's very nervous!  Who wouldn't be?! \nTom looks at Mink for the first time. \nTom Mink-- \nMink The spot he's in, who wouldn't be!  He asked me to ask you to ask Leo to take care of him.  You know, put in a good word with Leo.  Leo listens to you.  Not that Leo wouldn't help the Motzoh anyway!  A guy like Bernie?  A square gee like the Motzah!  A straight shooter like him? \nTom I don't get it, Mink-- \nMink What's to get?!  It's as plain as the nose-- \nTom I thought you were Bluepoint's sycophant. \nMink Yeah Tom, that's right.  But a guy can have more than one friend, can't he?  Not that I'd want Bluepoint to know about it, but a square gee like the Motzah?  He's a right guy, Tom!  He's a straight shooter!  I know he's got a mixed reputation, but for a sheeny he's got a lot a good qualities! \nTom has reached the foot of a large staircase.  He turns to look at Mink with mild curiosity. \nTom Why should I care what happens to Bernie? \nMink C'mon Tom, you like Bernie dontcha? \nTom I don't like anybody, Mink, you know that. \nMink Well, you like his sister. \nTom What's that supposed to mean? \nMink Nothing, Tom.  If it ain't my business I got not a thing to say. \nTom studies Mink for a beat. \nTom What's going an between you and Bernie? \nMink Nothin, Tom!  We're just friends--you know, amigos? \nHe sics on his cigarette and looks nervously around the floor, then back at Tom, who stares coolly back. \nTom You're a fickle boy, Mink.  If Bluepoint found out you had another \"amigo\"--well, I don't peg him for the understanding type. \nMink is startled.  In a high shrill voice, as Tom walks up the stairs, clutching his drink: \nMink Find out!?  How would he find out?!  Damnit Tom, me and you ain't even been talking!  Jesus Tom, damnit, Jesus! \n13.  INT   LEO'S OFFICE \nPulling Tom as he enters the office. \nLeo (off) 'Lo, Tom.  You know O'Gar. . . \nREVERSE \nLeo faces us from behind his desk. \nSeated in two chairs facing the desk, twisting around to greet Tom, are two men.  O'Gar is a large man wearing a police uniform.  Dale Levander wears a suit; a florid man with a shock of white hair, in his mid-sixties. \nLeo . . . and the mayor. \nTom I ought to.  I voted for him six times last May. \nLevander chuckles. \nLevander And that ain't the record, either. \nTom is crossing to the bar. \nLeo Verna turned up.  She's downstairs. \nTom, his back to Leo as he pours a drink, stiffens. \nTom . . . She say where she'd been? \nLeo No, I uh. . . didn't want to press her.  Hear about Rug? \nDrink in hand, Tom turns and crosses to perch an a corner of Leo's desk. \nTom Yeah, R.I.P. \nLeo They took his hair, Tommy.  Jesus that's strange. Why would they do that? \nTom Maybe it was Injuns. \nLeo Eye-ties, more like it.  Giovanni Casparro. \nTom So you figure it was Caspar bumped Rug? \nLeo, with a puzzled smile, glances at O'Gar and the mayor, and then back at Tom. \nLeo . . . Well it's pretty obvious ain't it? \nTom Mm. . . So what's the plan? \nLeo Jump on the guinea hard.  With both feet. \nHe looks at the mayor who shifts uncomfortably in his seat. \n. . . Give him the low-down, Dale. \nMayor Yes, well. . . Leo here has just reminded us that Mr. Caspar operates several clubs in our city wherein the patrons imbibe of rum and play at games of chance. \nMorosely: \nO'Gar And we're sunnosed to stop the party. \nTom Uh-huh. . . \nLooking at Leo, he jerks his head towards the two men. \n. . . They don't seem too happy about it, Leo. \nO'Gar Naw, it ain't that, Tom. \nMayor Jesus, Tom!  We do as we're told! \n", "test1_true": "Tom Maybe they're right not to like it.  Stirring up this hornets' nest won't be good for anyone.  And it'll mean killing. \nLeo Well I'm not thrilled about it either, but I can't just lay down to Caspar. \nTom You could do worse.  You might not like it, but giving up Bernie Bernheim is a pretty small price to pay for peace.  Business is business and a war's going to hurt everybody.  Bernie plays with fire, he's got to deal with the consequences-- even if that means he gets bumped off. \nLeo Sweet Jesus, Tom, that ain't even the point anymore.  Caspar pooped Rug.  The day I back down from a fight, Caspar is welcome to the rackets, this town, and my place at the table.  I didn't start this thing, but-- \nTom's voice is sharp: \nTom You did start it--you and Verna-- \nThe mayor has risen to his feet.  Uncomfortably: \nMayor We can dangle, Leo, if you'd prefer. \nLeo Siddown Dale, we're all friends here. \nTom --and Caspar hasn't broken the rules, Bernie has- -and you too, by helping him.  And if that isn't enough, consider that if you make it a war, you have more to lose than Caspar. \nLeo is getting up from behind the desk and walking over to stare out the window. \nLeo Okay, but more to beat him with.  Jesus, Tom, the two of us've faced worse odds. \nTom But never without reason.  It helps to have one. \nLeo doesn't reply.  Tom is irritated, but shrugs indif- ference. \n. . . Well, it's your call. \nHe gets to his feet and starts for the door. \n. . . My opinion use to count for something around here, but it's always yours to take or leave. \nLeo has turned from the window and is striding after Tom, gesturing appologetically. \nLeo Aw, c'mon Tommy.  Its not like that. . . \nThe door clicks shut. \n. . . Goddamnit.  Goddamn kid is just like a twist. \n14.  CUT TO: FAT TONY \nTending the downstairs bar as Tom stalks over. \nTom Gimme a stiff one. \nTony No small talk, huh?  They shoot vour nag? \nTony has finished pouring a shot of whiskey which Tom immediately knocks back. \nTom If there's any justice.  Verna around? \nTony She stepped into the ladies, room.  You got Lazarre's five hundred? \nTom He'll have to carry me for a few days. \nTom is pouring himself another drink. \nTony He ain't gonna like that.  Couldn't, you get it from Leo? \nTom is irritated: \nTom It's not Leo's debt.  I'll pay my own way. \nTony I admire a man of principle.  Does this go on the tab? \nDrink in hand, Tom is already walking away. \n15.  INT   LADIES' LOUNGE \nAs Tom bangs through the door, still carelessly holding his tumbler of whiskey.  A rogue lock of hair hangs down over his forehead. \nTom Close your eyes, ladies, I'm coming through. \nREVERSE \nThe hubbub of female voices evaporates as all turn to look at the male intruder. \nThe lounge's decor is done in various shades of pink.  Some of the women apply make-up facing the large bulb-encircled mirrors on overstuffed seashell shaped pink chairs.  Other women sit, smoking, in the banquettes that line the other wall. \nAll react to Tom's entrance with surprise mixed with various degrees of outrage, and they hurry to gather their things and leave.  The one exception is Verna, who looks at Tom with unperturbed distaste. \nAs he crosses to her seashell chair: \nTom Who's the warpaint for? \nVerna Go home and dry out. \nTom You don't need it for Leo, believe me.  He already thinks you're the original Miss Jesus. \nShe glances hurriedly around the lounge, but the last of the women are already leaving. \nVerna . . . What the hell's the matter with you? \nTom What's the matter with you?  Afraid people might get the right idea? \nVerna studies him for a beat. \nVerna Leo's got the right idea.  I like him, he's honest and he's got a heart. \nTom weaves a couple of steps closer to her. \nTom Then its true what they say.  Opposites attract. \nVerna Do me a favor and mind your own business. \nShe turns back to the mirror and starts applying her lipstick.  Tom drops down to face her in the mirror. \nTom This is my business.  Intimidating helpless women is part of what I do. \nVerna Then find one and intimidate her. \nTom swallows the rest of his drink in one gulp. \n", "test1_id": 3066, "test2_input": "Through the woods, pulling the two men, Bernie in the foreground.  Tree limbs groan in the wind. \nBernie is stumbling, his clothes rumpled and dirty, his face stained by tears and blood from the gun blow.  His shaking voice strains for a tone of reasonableness: \nBernie . . . Tommy, you can't do this.  You don't bump guys.  You're not like those animals back there. \nTom marches on, face drawn, silent. \n. . . It's not right, Tom.  They can't make us do this.  It's a wrong situation.  They can't make us different people than we are.  We're not muscle, Tom.  I never killed anybody.  I used a little information for a chisel, that's all.  I couldn't help it, Tom, it's my nature.  Somebody hands me an angle, I play it.  I don't deserve to die for that!  D'you think I do?  I'm just a grifter!  Huh, Tom? \nStill no response from Tom.  Bernie is fighting a losing battle to keep himself from whining. \n. . . But I'll tell you what, I never crossed a friend.  Huh, Tom?  Never killed anybody, never crossed a friend.  Nor you, I'll bet.  We're not like those animals.  You can't do this!  You're not like those animals.  This is not us!  This is some hop dream! \nTom's face is a ---ny mask.  Bernie is losing control again.  He starts to weep. \n. . . It's a dream!  Tommy!  I'm praying to you! I can't die!  I can't die!  Out here in the woods!  Like a dumb animal!  I can't die! \nHe turns and sinks to his knees, wailing, his hands clasped in front of him, staring up at Tom. \n. . . You can't kill me.  I'm praying to you! look in your heart!  I'm praying to you!  Look in your heart! \nTom stares down at Bernie, his face drawn and pale. \n. . . I'm praying to you!  Look in your heart! \nSlowly Tom raises the gun and levels it at Bernie's head. \n. . . Look in your heart!  Look in your-- \nBOOM!  The gun blast is deafening.  With it, Bernie's sobbing abruptly stops. \nThe shot echoes away in the woods, taking the wind with it, leaving silence. \nCLOSE   BERNIE \nStill kneeling, in shock, staring wide-eyed at Tom. \nFinally, whispering: \nBernie . . . Tommy. \nTom Shutup.  You're dead, get me? \nStill whispering: \nBernie I understand.  I'm dead.  God bless you-- \nTom Shutup.  You have to disappear.  You have to blow, for good.  Nobody can see you, nobody can know. \nBernie God bless you-- \nTom Go somewhere no one knows you.  Anyone sees you, you really are dead, I don't care, you're not my problem any more. \nBernie Of course not.  Of course not.  You've done your share.  Thank you.  Don't worry, I understand. Thank you-- \nTom Shutup. Just get the hell out, before I change my mind. \nBernie is already on his feet, and running. \nCLOSE ON TOM \nWatching Bernie go. \nTRACKING \nPulling Bernie as he runs.  Foreground trees flash by.  In the background we see Tom standing, his gun dangling at his side. \nBoom!--another gun blast.  Running, Bernie reacts, but Tom has only fired into the ground. \nOn the echo of the shot we cut to: \n41.  WIDE   THE ROAD \nTic-Tac and Frankie are leaning against the car, trading the flask back and forth. \nIn the background, Tom emerges from the woods. \nFrankie Put one in his brain? \nTom takes a few steps more before answering: \nTom . . . Yeah. \nFrankie Attaboy. \nFADE OUT \nOver black we hear the sound of coins being dropped into a phone box. \n42.  FADE IN \nLooking down a deserted street towards a glowing phone booth on a dark corner.  Tom stands inside the booth waiting, the receiver to his ear. \nTom Mink?  Tom Duchaisne.  Where've you been?. . . \nCLOSE ON TOM \nInside the phone booth. \n. . . Well you're lucky, Bluepoint's been looking for you.  Bernie's dead--Stop wailing and listen to me.  Caspar knows you were in on selling out his fix. . . I guess I gave him that idea.  Sorry Mink, we were chatting and it just slipped out.-- Shutup and let me talk.  You've gotta make yourself missing, but let me know where you hole up.  You're gonna say some things for me. . . Some stories.  About Bluepoint, to Caspar--don't worry, I'll let you know.  For now just dis- appear. . . Yeah, I got you into it.  Just remember, Mink, I'm the only one who can get you out. \nTom hangs up the phone, turns around and opens up the glass door. \nWHOMMMP!  A fist slams into his stomach, driving him back into the phone booth, knocking his hat off of his head. \nThe man who hit him leans down, picks up the hat, dusts it off and hands it into the booth.  It is Dead Terry, the tall cadaverous man we saw earlier outside of Leo's office. A cigarette dangles from his lower lip. \nBehind him a black sedan is parked at the curb.  Three or four gunmen stand on the sidewalk looking warily up and down the road. \nTom looks up, the color drained from his face, and reaches feebly out for his hat. \nTom 'Lo, Terry.  Getting out the vote? \nDead Terry flicks his cigarette away and smiles. \n", "test2_true": "Tom Mm. . . \nTerry starts to turn away. \n. . . Tell Leo he's not God on the throne, he's just a cheap mick political boss with no brains and an office that looks like a French whore- house. \nTom moves to exit the booth but Terry lays a hand on his shoulder. \nTerry One more thing. . . \nHe cracks Tom across the chin with a clean left hook, knocking him back into the booth again. \nTom rubs his chin, looking up at Terry. \nTom Leo say that too. . . ? \nAs Terry and the gunmen get into the car: \nTerry No, I said that.  Cross Leo and next time I'll say plenty. \nWe FADE OUT as the door slams and the car roars off. \nOver black we hear: \nCaspar When you're right you're right, but you never say I told you so. \n43.  FADE IN \nOn Tom, sitting into frame in Caspar's office. \nTom So what'm I right about? \nBehind his desk, Caspar is smiling. \nCaspar Well, I'll tell ya, but first you gotta promise not to say I told you so. \nTom's eyes hold an Caspar's.  He is taking out a pack of cigarettes. \nTom I never say that.  And I don't like people who do. \nCaspar Mink was robbin' me right along with the Mptzah. \nTom . . . What convinced you of that? \nCaspar Mink Larouie took a powder.  We can't find him. Bluepoint's makin' excuses for him, but personal- ly, I think you were right.  I think Mink and Bernie was in it together.  I think Mink heard you'd bumped the Motzah, and lit out.  The lousy sonofabitch. \nHis eyes on Caspar, Tom takes out a cigarette, lights it, takes a deep drag. \nTom . . . I told you so. \nCaspar laughs. \nCaspar Okay.  You got a lip on ya.  Ats all right.  I don't generally care for it, but that's all right. . . You were a good sport to bump the Motzah.  I just like to make sure my friends is my friends.  So. \nHe throws his hands up. \n. . . Friends, right? \nTom How d'you know Mink skipped? \nCaspar Bluepoint can't find him. \nTom So he says. \nCaspar stares at Tom. \nCaspar Meanin' what, exactly? \nTom Maybe nothing. . . I didn't give it much thought until now, since a guy will say pretty much anything when he knows his number is up, but just before I bumped Bernie he swore to me that Bluepoint and Mink were setting him up.  That they were the ones that were selling out your fix. \nCaspar looks at Tom. \nCaspar 'Zat so. . . \nHe thinks for a beat. \n. . . Like you say, a guy'll say anything. \nTom . . . Uh-huh.  So why isn't Bluepoint here? \nCaspar Well. . . \nHe figdets. \n. . . He don't care for you, kid.  Maybe it's only fair to tell you. . .  After you left us, he tried to sell me on a double-cross.  He says to me, why don't we double-cross you and give you the bump once we get the Motzah.  But I figure a deals a deal, you're square with me, you bump the Motzah, I'll hold up my end.  Question of ethics. Everything above board, that's how I like it, so everybody knows who's a friend and who's an enemy. . .  But Bluepoint wouldn't cross me.  We go back. \nTom Uh-huh. . . Course, there's always that wild card when love is involved. . . \nCaspar is staring intently at Tom.  After a beat: \nCaspar . . . I know Mink is Bluepoint's boy, but I still don't make it that way. \nTom Mm.  Well, then there's nothing to worry about. \nCaspar seems lost in thought: \nCaspar Yeah. . . \nWe hear the door to the office open offscreen and Johnny Jr. runs into frame clutching a scrolled piece of paper. \nJohnny Jr. Poppa!  Poppa!  I got a prize from the-- \nCaspar holds his hand up to quiet the youngster, still looking at Tom. \nCaspar Just a minute. \nAs Tom rises to his feet: \n. . . Course, there's no reason not to be careful-- \nJohnny Jr. Poppa!  Poppa!  The sisters gave me a--unnnh! \nCascar has cuffed him sharply on the side of the head. He points at Tom. \nCaspar Shaddap!  You take a page outta this guy's book. A little less you talk and a little more you think! \n", "test2_id": 3067, "test3_input": "Tom holds Bluepoint's look. \nTom Is there a point?  Or are you just brushing up on your small talk? \nBluepoint I like that.  Cool under fire.  I'm impressed. \nVery quickly he delivers two slaps--forehand and backhand. Tom's head rocks but he recovers to stare back at Blue- point. \n. . . The gorilla didn't know whose stiff we found, but I can fill that in.  You killed Mink, you sonofabitch. \nHe grabs Tom by the lapels, swings him away from the desk, and lands a punch on his chin. \nTom stumbles backs. \nCaspar has turned from the fireplace, watching the doings across the room. \nBluepoint moves towards Tom, breathing hard with antici- pated pleasure. \n. . . Come here, bum.  I'm gonna send you to a deep dark place.  And I'm gonna have fun doing it. \nBluepoint's hand snakes out and grabs Tom by the front of the coat, hauling him close.  He slaps him savagely. \n. . . It was Mink, and by God I'll hear you say it! \nTom Is this how you taught Drop his story? \nIn one motion Bluepoint's hands wrap around Tom's throat choking him off.  As the pressure increases, Tom, purpling, sinks to his knees. \nBluepoint I like the way you think.  Maybe when you're dead I'll cut your head off, put it on my mantle-- \nWHANG--a shovel blade swings into frame to smash Bluepoint in the face. \nHe drops. \nFrom somewhere in the room, a scream. \nBluepoint is on his hands and knees, one hand pressed over his ruined face, blood pouring from between the fingers. \nCaspar Sonafabitch. . . \nHe stands over Bluepoint with the fireplace shovel. \n. . . If there's one thing I can't stand, it's a double-cross artist.  I had a feeling 'bout this sonofabitch-- \nHe swings the shovel back and delivers an overhand blow to the top of Bluepoint's head. \nBluepoint drops to the floor, instantly motionless. \nThe scream, however, continues. \nDrop Johnson, on the couch, his eyes wide, his hands spastically squeezing his knees, is looking down at Bluepoint.  Drop's mouth is stretched wide.  He is scream- ing. \nTom gets slowly to his feet. \nCascar looks at Drop. \n. . . Shut it, you sonofabitch! \nHe is striding over to him with the shovel. \n. . . I'll give you something to holler about! \nTom intercepts him. \nTom Johnny.  It's okay.  Bluepoint made him.  It's okay.  It's not important. \nCaspar is panting. \nCaspar Then have him shut it! \nDrop does. \nThere is a beat. \nIncongruously, Caspar's bellow breaks the silence: \n. . . And we do the same to Mink!  This very same night! \nAnother silence.  The rain.  The crackle of the fire. \nTom's tone is soothing: \nTom . . . Johnny.  We can't double-cross him.  He wants to spill the whole set-up-- \nCaspar stares at him through glazed eyes. \nCaspar I've never let a sonofabitch walk! \nTom You've never crossed anyone . . . \nCaspar is staring at him.  His eyes have lost some of their glaze. \nTom . . . Four o'clock, my place.  Mink's coming in on his own hook so I promised him the money. Don't make me out a liar-- \nDrop is suddenly screaming again. \nCaspar looks where Drop is looking: \nBluepoint is raising his head, moaning.  His face is a mask of blood.  One hand gropes in his overcoat pocket for his gun. \nCaspar shouts over Drop's howl as he pulls something from his desk drawer: \nCaspar . . . Lookit this, kid. \nHe strides over to Bluepoint. \n. . . Something I try and teach all my boys. . . \nWith the gun point blank against the back of Bluepoint's head, he fires. \nTom recoils. \n. . . Always put one inna brain! \n72.  A CLOCK \n", "test3_true": "We are pulling back and down to reveal that we are inside a diner; we are isolating on a section of counter on which sits a half-empty cup of coffee and an ashtray half-filled with butts.  A hand puts some change on the counter and leaves frame. \n73.  EXT   DINER \nAs Tom pushes the door open and exits.  He tucks his overcoat collar up as he walks; it is pouring rain. \nTom turns at the sound of approaching heels and recognizes Verna with some surprise.  He glances up and down the street, but it is deserted.  Verna doesn't seem to much notice the rain. \nTom 'Lo, Verna.  What's the rumpus. \nColdly, as they walk on together: \nVerna I was just in the neighborhood, feeling a little daffy.  What're you doing? \nTom . . . Walking. \nVerna Don't let on more than you have to. \nTom In the rain. \nTom glances at her. \n. . . What're you doing out? \nVerna Bernie's dead, isn't he? \nThey walk on for a beat, Tom looking down at the sidewalk. Finally: \nTom . . . What makes you think that? \nVerna That's no answer. \nTom again glances around, and escorts Verna into a dark doorway alcove.  It is very small; they have to crowd into each other to stay out of the rain.  Water drops from the brim of Tom's fedora.  He studies her for a beat. \nTom I can't tell you anything yet. \nVerna Nobody cares, do they?  His friends didn't really like him. \nTom shrugs. \nTom He didn't like his friends. \nVerna You're a sonofabitch, Tom.  You're someone to talk.  You got me to tell you where he was and then you killed him. \nShe is raising a gun into frame: She presses it into his stomach. \nTom stiffens but continues to stare at her calmly. \n. . . Tell me why.  What was in it for you? \nTom Nothing for me. \nVerna Then why? \nTom . . . Giving up Bernie was the only way I could see to straighten things out for Leo. \nVerna You said you didn't care about Leo. \nTom I said we were through.  It's not the same thing. \nVerna looks at him. \nVerna I don't understand.  I don't care.  I don't care what reason you had or thought you had. \nShe raises the gun and presses its barrel into the under- side of Tom's chin.  Tom stiffens but remains calm. \nTom . . . He's still alive. \nVerna stares at him. \nVerna You expect me to  believe you? \nTom . . . No. \nVerna That's you all over, Tom.  A lie and no heart. \nVerna pulls back the hammer.  There is a long beat. \nVerna's eves widen, locked an Tom's. \nTom returns her look; his is sympathetic. \nVerna starts trembling. \nTom's tone is soft, understanding.  It's the first time we have ever seen compassion from him. \nTom . . . It isn't easy, is it Verna? \nShe abruptly lurches away and staggers a couple of paces onto the sidewalk in the rain.  She hugs a lamppost for support.  She is staring down at the street, still trem- bling. \nTom walks up behind her and rests a hand an her shoulder. \n. . . Are you all right? \nShe doesn't look around.  After a moment: \nVerna . . . I don't know how you did it. \nShe shrugs off his hand and stumbles off down the street. \nTom watches her dissappear into the rain. \n74.  CUT TO: TREE LIMBS \nNight, but sometime later--it has stopped raining.  The branches groan in the wind.  As they sway, streetlight glitters off the leaves, still wet with rain.. \nWe are booming down to reveal that we are in front of Tom's building, its windows dark.  During the boom we hear the rumble of an approaching car and the hiss of its tires on wet asphalt. \nThe boom down ends as the car pulls into frame to stop at the curb with the camera framed on the driver's window. The driver has a small bandage on his left cheek.  We hear Caspar's voice as we hear him getting out the back: \nCaspar Ya put the razor in cold water, not hot--'cause metal does what in cold? \nDriver I dunno, Johnny. \nWe hear the back door slam and Caspar appears in the front passenger window. \n", "test3_id": 3068}

You're dizzy for her. \nLeo scowls at Tom. \nLeo What of it?  Jesus, Tom, ain't you ever been bit by that bug? \nTom Leo, if she's such an angel, why are you looking for her at four in the morning? \nLeo digs his hands into his pockets and slouches back, profoundly embarassed. \nLeo I put a tail on her this afternoon. \nTom Hah! \nLeo Yeah, I asked Rug Daniels to follow her around-- just, you know, just to keep her out of trouble. \nTom And to tell you what trouble she was managing to whip up herself. \nLeo It wasn't to spy, Tom; I was worried.  After that meeting with Caspar, well--you can't be too careful. \nTom Uh-huh.  And what did Rug tell you that has you scurrying over here? \nLeo That's just it.  Nothing.  He's disappeared. \nTom laughs humorlessly. \nTom So you've lost your ladyfriend and the tail you put an her. \nLeo I guess it does sound pretty sorry at that. . . \nHe looks from his empty glass up to Tom. \n. . . Help me out, Tom.  I wouldn't know where to start looking.  You know Rug's crowd, you know the people Verna runs with.  I'm just worried now, with things the way they are between me and Caspar-- \nTom gives a wave of disgust. \nTom You shouldn't be confronting Johnny Caspar, it's what I've been trying to tell you.  You can't trade body blows with him.  He's gotten too strong. \nFor the first time Leo displays some testiness: \nLeo I reckon I can still trade body blows with any man in this town. . . \nHe sighs, looks back down at his drink. \n. . . Except you, Tom. \nTom And Verna. \nLeo smiles good-naturedly. \nLeo Okay, give me the needle.  I am a sap, I deserve it. . . \nHe stands and walks to the door. \nTom doesn't move.  His eyes remain fixed on the chair Leo has just vacated. \nLeo pauses in the open doorway. \n. . . Thanks for the drink.  Let me know if you hear anything. . . \nThe door closes and he is gone. \nTom grimaces and stands up.  Sunlight is just starting to come in through the windows, defining for the first time the corners of the large semi-circular room as Tom walks across it to the bedroom.  Distant early-morning traffic noise is filtering up from the street. \n7.   INT  BEDROOM \nAs Tom opens the double oak doors and enters, leaving them open. \nHe crosses to the bed and sits an its edge, hunched forward, thinking.  Behind him, a woman stirs. \nWoman (sleepily) Who was that? \nTom Leo. . . \nHe takes a cigarette from the nightstand and lights it. \n. . . He's looking for you. \nVerna stiffens. \nVerna Did you tell him I was here? \nTom No. \nVerna relaxes. \nVerna Did you put in a good word for my brother? \nTom No. \nVerna You said you would. \nTom . . . I said I'd think about it. \nVerna What did you tell him? \nTom is lost in thought.  He exhales smoke. \nTom . . . Did you see Rug Daniels last night? \nVerna No.  What did you tell Leo? \nTom finally turns to face her.  After looking at her for a beat: \nTom . . . I told him you were a tramp and he should dump you. \nA shoe flies past his head and hits the wall behind him. \nVerna You're a son of a bitch, Tom. \n", "test1_true": "We are on an extreme close shot of a small dog.  Behind him, in the distance, we can see the mouth of the alley. \nThe dog is on point, perfectly still, one front leg crooked and raised off the ground, his ears pointed straight up, his eyes in a fixed stare. \nA MAN \nis slouched, half-sitting, against the wall of the alley. He is motionless.  His mouth is agape.  His eyes are rolled up in a lifeless stare. \nHe is wearing an overcoat but it is unbuttoned and reveals a blood stain in the middle of his chest.  His fedora lies on the ground near one of his splayed hands. \nThere is something subtly odd about his hair. \nCLOSE SHOT   A LITTLE BOY \nPerhaps five years old.  He stares down at the dead man in front of him. \nCLOSE SHOT   THE MAN \nStaring vacantly. \nTHE BOY \nAfter a moment, he reaches forward. \nTHE MAN \nAs the boy's hand enters frame.  The boy pokes once at the man's shoulder. \nThere is no reaction. \nThe boy touches the top of the man's head. \nThe man's hair slips forward a couple of inches over over his forehead. \nTHE BOY \nStaring. \nTHE MAN \nAlso staring, his skewed hairpiece ill becoming his stunned expression. \nThe boy reaches forward and takes the hairpiece off the man's head.  Now a bald man stares off into smace, still looking stunned, still quite dead. \nWIDE SHOT   THE ALLEY \nThe dead man and the little bov face each other in profile in the middle foreground.  In the background, between them, the little boy's dog faces us, still on point, still whining. \nThe little boy is fascinated by the hairpiece he holds.  He turns it over and around, and looks from it to the dead man. \nSuddenly the boy turns and runs, away from us, towards the mouth of the alley, still clutching the hairpiece. \nAs he passes the dog it turns and runs after him, wagging its tail, happy to be leaving. \nFADE OUT \n9.   FADE IN: INT   DINER EVENING \nA man sits facing us at the counter in the foreground.  His face is hidden by the newspaper he is reading. \nThe page of the newspaper being presented to the camera bears a story headlined:  GANGSTER SLAIN.  The subhead: Politician's \"Aide\" Found Dead in Alley. \nAfter a beat the diner drops the paper to the counter, and we see that it is Tom, wearing overcoat and hat.  He is grimacing at whatever he was reading.  He stands and digs into his pocket. \nREVERSE \nLooking down at the newspaper an the counter, next to a steaming cup of coffee.  Tom's hand enters to put some change on the counter, leaves, and we hear his receding footsteps. \nThe headlined story on the page Tom was reading is: THUNDERCLAP INJURED IN RACING MISHAP. \n10.

He puts his coat and hat on the check counter. \nTom Hello, Beryl-- \nHer arm sweeps across frame to slap Tom hard. \nCheck Girl (off) Ain't you got a conscience? \nTom stares dumbly. \nON BERYL \nA diminutive woman in a french maid's uniform with a pill box hat.  She rocks her weight on one leg with her hands proceed defiantly on her hips. \n. . . It's a little voice inside that tells you when you been a heel! \nTom Mine's been mum lately--what'd I do? \nBeryl Stood me up is all.  Made me wait an hour and a half is all?  Or maybe you don't remember sayin' you'd pick me up after work last night.  I seen heels in my time, sure, plenty of 'em!  But none so low as couldn't tell me to my face when they was sick of me! . . . \nShe throws a check number at him. \n. . . You know where you can stick it! \n12.

What's the rumpus? \nTom Mink. \nMink throws a glance back in the direction of the coat check. \nMink . . . I see you got your hat back. \nTom Yeah, what of it. \nMink Not a thing, Tommy.  I got not a thing to say. Listen, Bernie wants to see you.  It's important. \n", "test1_id": 3066, "test2_input": "Bernie Your other friends wouldn't break in, huh? \nTom shakes his head. \nTom My other friends wanna kill me, so they wouldn't knock. \nHe crosses to the chair facing Bernie's. \n. . . What's on your mind, Bernie? \nBernie Things. . . I guess you must be kind of angry. I'm supposed to be gone, far away.  I guess it seems sort of irresponsible, my being here. . . \nBernie leaves room for a response but Tom is only listen- ing. \n. . . And I was gonna leave.  Honest I was.  But then I started thinking.  If I stuck around, that would not be good for you.  And then I started thinking that. . . that might not be bad for me. \nTom still doesn't answer. \n. . . I guess you didn't see the play you gave me.  I mean what'm I gonna do?  If I leave, I got nothing--no money, no friends, nothing.  If I stay, I got you.  Anyone finds out I'm alive-- you're dead, so. . . I got you, Tommy. \nTom is silent. \n. . . What's the matter, you got nothin' to crack wise about?  Bernie ain't so funny anymore? \nBernie's lip is quivering.  His voice is softer: \n. . . I guess I made kinda a fool a myself out there. . . I was shittin' myself, Tommy. . . you didn't tell anyone about that. \nTom No. \nBernie 'Course you know about it. . . its . . . It's a painful memory.  And I can't help remembering that you put the finger on me, and you took me out there to whack me. . . I know you didn't. . . I know you didn't shoot me. . . but. . . but-- \nTom But what have I done for you lately? \nBernie Don't smart me. \nHe stares hard at Tom for a moment. \n. . . See, I wanna watch you squirm.  I wanna see you sweat a little.  And when you smart me, it ruins it. \nBernie gets to his feet, keeping the gun trained on Tom. \n. . . There's one other thing I want.  I wanna see Johnny Caspar cold and stiff.  That's what you'll do for your friend Bernie. . . \nHe has opened the door to the flat. \n. . . In the meantime I'll stay outa sight.  But if Caspar ain't stiff in a couple of days I start eating in restaurants. \nThe door shuts behind him. \nTom, heretofore very still, springs from the chair, goes to the bedroom and reemerges with a gun. \nHe bolts for the door, instinctively grabbing his hat off a hook.  He is wearing only his boxer shorts, a sleeveless tee-shirt, and the hat jammed onto his head. \nHe throws open the door. \n52.  HALLWAY \nEmpty. \nTom runs to the bannister and looks down. \nHIS POV \nA flight down, a hand slides down along the railing. Bernie's trotting footsteps echo in the stairwell. \nTOM \nHe runs back to his apartment. \n53.  APARTMENT \nTom runs across to the open window and clambers out. \n54.  FIRE ESCAPE \nTom trots down.  His bare feet ring dully against the steel of the fire escape. \nHe reaches the bottom landing, swings over the railing, hangs by his hands for one brief moment and then drops. \nTHE ALLEY \nAs his bare feet hit the pavement.  Tom is a silhouette in the lamplight from the end of the alley. \nHe straightens from his crouch and runs. \nBACK DOOR \nOf his apartment building--over Tom's shoulder as he enters frame.  The empty, brightly lit hall inside runs straight the length of the building to the front door, which is just closing. \nTom throws open the back door. \n55.  HALLWAY \nAs Tom runs through toward the front. \nBefore reaching the door, he falls violently forward. \nHis gun skates away from him across the floor. \nHe starts to roll over to look behind him and a crunching blow catches him on the chin, snapping his head the rest of the way around and sending him flat onto his back. \nBernie, who has emerged from under the staircase, towers over him. \nBernie You make me laugh, Tommy.  You're gonna catch cold, then you're no good to me. . . \nHe is walking over to Tom's gun, which he picks up and unloads into his hand. \n. . . What were you gonna do if you caught me, I'd just squirt a few and then you'd let me go again. \nHe tosses Tom the empty gun and walks out. \nTom, white-faced and shivering, pulls himself up to sit leaning against the wall. \nA first-floor apartment door opens and a sixty-year-old woman emerges, pulling a housecoat tight.  She goggles at Tom. \n", "test2_true": "Tom tries a smile that looks idiotic. \nTom They took everything. . . \nLONG SHOT   THE HALL \nClucking sympathetically, the old woman is leaning down to help Tom up.

CUT TO: CLOSE SHOT   PLAQUE \nSet into an exterior wall, identifying the SHENANDOAH CLUB. \n57.  INT   CLUB \nTom, in his overcoat and hat, is walking up to the bar. \nTom 'Lo, Tony.  How's the club holding up? \nBehind the bar, Tony looks sour. \nTony We're managing to squeak by without you.  Got Lazarre's money? \nTom No. \nTony Well, you're not supposed to be here since you turned rat. \nTom Relax, Tony, Leo's not around, is he? \nTony Maybe Leo's not the only one doesn't care for you here. \nTom works to keep his smile. \nTom . . . Fickle, huh Tony?  You could almost be a dame. \nTony Pal, you read my mind, you sneak my thoughts. Jesus, I hope you know what you're doing. \nTom No more than usual.  The last couple days, you booked any heavy bets on a long shot at Satur- day's fights? \nTony Why the hell should I tell you? \nTom shrugs. \nTom The truth is Tony, there's no reason on earth. \nStaring at Tom, Tony blows air through his teeth.  He sets up a drink for Tom. \nTony . . . Saturday's fights.  Yeah.  Drop Johnson parked two yards on one yesterday.  On Sailor Reese, an undercard bum. \nTom downs the drink in a gulp. \nTom Drop Johnson?  He play your book much? \nTony You kidding?  I didn't even know he could count. \nFrom offscreen there is a loud CRASH and, with that, many of the club patrons start screaming.  Tony looks off and Tom swivels to look. \nTony Oh Jesus. . . You bring them with you? \nAs he shoves off from the bar: \nTom No. \nUniformed policemen are pouring into the club, wielding axes.  They destroy everything in their path, sweeping the elegantly dressed patrons before them. \nTom wades into the sea of blue and nods at Delahanty, the policeman we know from the raid on Caspar's. \nTom 'Lo, Brian.  Still fighting the good fight? \nDelahanty 'Lo, Tom.  Neither wind nor rain nor snow. . . \nTom That's just the mailmen.  Is O'Gar here? \nDelahanty Just look for the long face. \n58.  EXT   THE CLUB \nIt is just cracking dawn. \nO'Gar is leaning against a car, facing the club, taking in the scene as he glumly chews on a toothpick.  The street is clogged with police vehicles. \nTom approaches. \nTom 'Lo, O'Gar.  You don't look happy. \nO'Gar Look at this mess.  Gutting the golden calf again. \nHe shakes his head. \n. . . I don't know whether to laugh or cry. \nTom Yeah, it's awful confusing.  You know a yegg named Drop Johnson? \nO'Gar We've spanked him a couple times. \nTom Where does he flop? \nO'Gar The Terminal Hotel on Bay Street, whenever he's broke--which is one hundred percent of always. Jesus . . . \nHe reacts to gunfire from the second story of the club. \n. . . Don't nobody ask me, since I'm only the chief around here, but I'll tell you my opinion: Caspar's just as crazy as Leo.  And an eye-tie into the bargain. \nAs he heads off: \nTom What's the matter, O'Gar, doesn't anything ever suit you? \n59.  PULLING TOM \nAs he walks along a nearby street; we can still faintly hear the sirens and police activity back at the club. \nA black touring car is tooling up alongside of him.  Tic- Tac leans out the driver's window.  He has welts around his mouth and looks like he has been a little roughed up. \n", "test2_id": 3067, "test3_input": "Tom A good feeling, huh.  When did the feeling return to your head? \nDrop . . . Huh? \nTom puts the hat on top of Drop's head.  Drop's eyes roll up to look at it, but otherwise he still doesn't move. \nThe hat, too small, sits ludicrously atop his head. \nTom starts toward the door. \nTom You've outgrown that one.  Must be all the thinking you've been doing. . . \nHe pauses with his hand on the knob. \n. . . Tell Bernie something's come up.  He has to get in touch.  There'll be nothing stirring til I talk to him. \nHe slams the door. \n65.  CUT TO: A LARGE WINDOW \nWe are looking at the ground-floor window from the street. Letters stencilled on the glass identify the SONS OF ERIN SOCIAL CLUB. \nA topcoated man scurries into frame, knocks out a pane with the grip of a gun, and tosses a small pipelike device inside.  He scurries away and we pan with him across the street to reveal a line of cars, police and civilian, parked along the far curb.  No men are visible except the scurrying man, who takes cover behind one of the parked cars. \nSOCIAL CLUB \nA beat.  From inside we hear a pair of trotting footsteps-- \nBOOM!  The window blows out, spitting glass into the street, along with a large dark form. \nTHE STREET \nGlass showers the pavement and a charred rag-doll of a body hits hard, face down, and skids a couple feet.  Smoke wisps from it. \nTHE CLUB \nA lick of flame from the bomb is already dying and heavy grey smoke is billowing out. \nTHE STREET \nMen start cautiously rising from behind the cars.  A lot of men.  Some wear police uniforms; some are civilians.  All are armed. \nTHE CLUB \nBillowing smoke. \nTHE STREET \nThe men have straightened up.  A policeman calls through a bullhorn: \nPoliceman All right.  Anyone left in there, come on out, grabbing air.  You know the drill. \nTHE CLUB \nAfter a beat, the front door swings open.  A man emerges, one hand in the air, one holding a handkerchief over his mouth. \nHe walks into the middle of the street. \nOne of the civilians behind the cars fires. \nThe man takes the bullet in the chest and drops to the ground, where he twitches. \nThe man who fired, in the foreground, grins.  A ripple of laughter runs down the line of men. \nTHE CLUB WINDOW \nSmoke still pouring out. \nWith a RAT-A-TAT-TAT muzzle flashes from inside illuminate the smoke. \nTHE STREET \nBullet hits chew up the cars and a few of the men; the others drop back down behind the cars and start returning fire. \nTHE WINDOW \nA forbidding black hole in the exterior wall.  A second tommy has joined the first to pour lead out into the street. \n66.  CUT TO: RECEPTION AREA \nTracking in an a youngish secretary in a severe dress, sitting behind a desk. \nFaintly, from a distance, we can still hear gunfire. \nSecretary 'Lo, Tom, where've you been hiding? \nREVERSE \nOn Tom. \nTom Hither and yon.  The mayor in? \nSecretary With Mr. Caspar. \nTom is already heading for the door. \nTom That's who I'm looking for.  Scare up some hootch, will you honey? \nSecretary Surely.  I'll announce you. \nAs he opens the door: \nTom Don't bother, I'm well liked. \n67.  INT    MAYOR'S OFFICE \nA grand, high-ceilinged place.  Mayor Levander sits behind his desk sputtering, his face turning purple.  Caspar, sitting across from him, is also turning purple.  Sitting to one side are two identical thirty-year-old men, appar- ently twins, mustachiced, silent, respectful, mournful, their hands clasped over the hats in their laps, wearing stiff new-looking suits with old-fashioned collars. \nMayor I can't do it, Johnny!  I'll look ridiculous! Why, it simply isn't done!  Assistants, maybe-- \nCaspar For a mayor, you don't hear so hot!  I said head! Head of the assessor's office! \nMayor But there's two of 'em! \nCaspar I can count!  Co-heads! \n", "test3_true": "Caspar Damn right--had every potato eater from County Cork an the public tit-- \nMayor But there's a way we do things, hallowed by usage and consecrated by time!  When we put people on the pad, when Leo was running things, we-- \nCaspar is furious: \nCaspar Leo ain't running things!  I ain't innarested in ancient history!  I'm running things now! \nMayor Johnny, no one appreciates that more than I!  I can give them jobs!  I can give them good jobs! I can even give them jobs where thev won't have to perform any work, where their lack of English will be no impediment!  But I cant-- \nCaspar What is this, the high hat?! \nThe mayor mops his face with a handkerchief and looks beseechingly at Tom. \nMayor Tom, can you explain it to him?  I can put them in public works but I can't-- \nTom You can do whatever the hell Caspar tells you.  I don't remember all this double-talk when Leo gave you an order. \nThe mayor looks flabbergasted. \nMayor Tom!  Jesus! \nTom Stop whimpering and do as you're told. \nCaspar You can start by gettin' outta here. \nMayor But Johnny, it's my office! \nCaspar Get outta here!  Take it on the heel and toe, before I whack you one!. . . \nThe mayor retreats and Casmar stares at the two men sitting to the side. \n. . . You too, beat it! \nThe two men look at each other, then back at Caspar. \nFirst Man . . . Partiamo? \nCaspar Yeah, go keep the mayor company.  I'll take care of ya's later. \nThe immigrants rise and leave the room.  Caspar takes out a handkerchief and wipes his brow. \n. . . Runnin' things.  It ain't all gravy. \nThe secretary enters the office with a bottle of whiskey, a soda siphon and ice.  She places it an the mayor's desk and leaves. \nWe can still hear faint gunfire and an occasional booming explosion that rattles the windows of the office. \nTom What's the fireworks? \nCaspar Knockin' over one of Leo's clubs.  Sonofabitch just won't go belly-up. . . I'm sorry, kid.  I heard about your little ride this morning. \nTom is walking over to pour himself a drink. \nTom Yeah, well sorry don't fix things.  We could just as easily've missed Bernie's corpse as stumbled over it, and I'd be dead now. \nCaspar I know, I know.  But it don't mean Bluepoint's up to anything.  So he heard some rumor Bernie ain't dead, those stories pop up, people seen Dillinger in eight states last week.  So he hears a story, and he don't like you much anyway, so he decides to check it out-- \nTom Any stories about Bernie being alive, Bluepoint's made up himself. \nCaspar Aw, you don't know that.  It don't even make sense--why would he? \nTom stares at Caspar for a beat. \nTom . . . There could be a damn good reason. . . \nCaspar squints at Tom. \n. . . If you've got a fixed fight coming up.  Do you? \nCaspar . . . Maybe.  Okay, yeah, sure.  Tomorrow night, the fix is in.  What of it? \nTom Bluepoint knows about it? \nCaspar Yeah. . . \nHe gazes off. \n. . . Okay, I get it. \nTom If Bluepoint's been selling you out on these fights, and means to again, he'll have to be able to point the finger at someone else-- \nUncomfortably: \nCaspar Yeah, yeah, I get it. \nTom --but with Bernie dead there ain't a hell of a lot of people he can point to. \nCaspar Yeah.  Bluepoint sells me out.  Makes pretend Bernie's still doin' it.  Ats real pretty. Bernie leaked the fix, and you take the fall for supposedly not killing him. . . . \nHe leans back in the mayor's chair and gazes off, sucking his lips in and out as he thinks.  Finally: \n. . . But I dunno, why would Bluepoint cross me like that?  Money, okay, everybody likes money. But somehow it don't seem like him.  And I know the Bluepoint. \nTom Nobody knows anybody.  Not that well. \nCaspar shakes his head. \nCaspar Money don't mean that much to him. \nTom shrugs. \nTom Then it's not just money he's after.  He's got a wart on his fanny. \nCaspar . . . Huh? \nTom A wart.  On his fanny.  Giving him the fidgets. Maybe he's sick of sitting on the couch and maybe behind your desk don't look like a bad place to move to.  Maybe he figures the money can help move him there. \nCaspar studies Tom. \nCaspar . . . Kid, you got a lip on ya. \nHe looks off again. \n. . . I don't generally care for it.  But you're honest, and that's something we can't get enough of in this business. . . I'll admit, since last we jawed, my stomach's been seazin' up on me. Bluepoint saying we should double-cross you; you double-cross once, where's it all end?  An innaresting ethical question.  I'll find Blue- point, talk to him, straighten it out-- \n", "test3_id": 3068}

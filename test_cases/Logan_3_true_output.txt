PRETTY BOY FIRES THE HARPOON GUN, retracts the cable and pins her to the ground. REAVERS AND FEDERALES SURROUND HER and PRETTY BOY is about to put on the restraints when-- 
SNIKT! -- LOGAN GUTS PRETTY BOY FROM BEHIND-- AND ENGAGES THE OTHERS as Laura pulls the harpoon from her side and runs. 
Laura is grabbed by THREE MORE REAVERS, WHO RESTRAIN HER AND STARTS TO DRAG HER AWAY -- BUT, SNIKT! -- 
TWO ADAMANTIUM FOOT CLAWS EMERGE FROM HER FEET dragging on the concrete, making a ringing sound, like chalk on a black board and -- suddenly -- with a double scissor-kick -- she stabs one Reaver in the thigh and the other in the throat, her gleaming foot claw sticking out the back of his neck. 
Logan stares, slack-jawed. Then notices-- 
PIERCE AND ANOTHER REAVER are moving on the limo, about to take Charles. Logan tosses them back and-- 
INT./EXT. LIMO - ABANDONED SMELTING PLANT - CONTINUOUS 
Logan drops behind the wheel, watching through the windshield as Laura takes on six or seven more hostiles. 
CHARLES (drunk with the meds) ...As I said, Logan, she's a mutant... Like you. Very much like you, in fact. 
Logan grimly starts the engine. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                37. 
CHARLES (CONT'D) Where are we going? 
Logan ignores Charles as he put the limo in gear, gaining speed, and then-- MAKES A HARD U-TURN AND -- 
WHAM! PLOWS INTO THE FEDERALES AND LAURA (WHO JUMPS ON THE HOOD TO AVOID IMPACT). 
Logan accelerates again, Laura clinging to the hood. Logan punches a button, opening the sunroof as gunfire starts to hit their limo. 
Laura leaps into the limo. Charles smiles at her, pleased and seemingly oblivious to the gunfire: 
CHARLES (CONT'D) Laura! 
As they take a hard turn, a side window shatters and LAURA INSTINCTIVELY SHIELDS CHARLES FROM THE BULLETS. 
LAURA GETS HIT AND matter of factly sucks the slug out of her arm and spits it on the seat like Lee Marvin. 
Logan meets eyes with Charles in his rear view. And that's when they are hit with A BARRAGE OF BULLETS-- 
WIDER -- SMELTING PLANT 
THE FEDERALES HAVE LEAPT INTO THEIR JEEPS and fire at Logan's limo as they spin out in the dirt, in pursuit. 
Disgusted, Pierce also gets behind the wheel and leads his Reavers in the opposite direction. 
THE PLANT GATE BLOCKED BY THE ARMADA OF VEHICLES, Logan drives straight at the chainlink fence-- and we prepare for a classic action movie fence smash. 
LOGAN Hold on! 
BUT THE LIMO HITS THE FENCE, BENDS THE SUPPORTS AND GRINDS TO A PATHETIC HALT, TANGLED IN MESH. As it would in real life. 
Federales open fire at the limo as Logan guns the engine in reverse, trying to get traction on the dirt. Other Federales speed toward them on motorcycles. 
Under massive fire, bullet-riddled, Logan's limo finds purchase, and he's backing out at high speed, ripping a long section of chain link from its posts and dragging this "tail" with him (driving backwards now). Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                   38. 
LOGAN SWERVES HARD AND THE CHAIN LINK "TAIL" SWINGS OUT AND WIPES OUT THE REAVER BIKES. One of the riders tumbles and grabs onto the chain link tail, the limo dragging him. 
The Reaver claws his way along the chain link toward the hood of the car, drawing his gun, firing at the windshield. 
Logan ducks and spins the car around. The dragging fence swings wide, LOSING THE REAVER ON THE FENCE. 
Pierce angrily peels his truck in another direction. 
Logan sees the main gate ahead. As he guns for it, he notices THE FLASHING RED TRAIN-WARNING LIGHTS at the loading dock. 
TWO FEDERALE JEEPS reach the sides of the limo, guns aimed squarely at Logan. Laura and Charles react as-- 
Logan steers the limo through a series of concrete structures FORCING THE JEEPS INTO VIOLENT COLLISIONS. 
Logan guns his limo into-- 
EXT. OPEN DESERT - DAY 
LOGAN'S LIMO RACES FROM THE PLANT GROUNDS, APPROACHING-- 
A HULKING FREIGHT TRAIN arriving quickly from parallel tracks. The train is moving faster than the limo. 
Logan makes a hard left, cranking the wheel just clipping the front corner of Pierce's truck, spinning toward the tracks. 
THE TRAIN HAS ALMOST CAUGHT UP WITH THEM AS-- 
THE LIMO PLOWS STRAIGHT INTO THE SIDE OF A FEDERALE TRUCK which gets squeezed between the limo and train. Sparks fly. 
LOGAN SPINS THE WHEEL, PUSHING THE TRUCK (and the Federale Commander in it) INTO THE PATH OF THE TRAIN AS-- 
LOGAN GUNS HIS LIMO ACROSS THE TRACKS ITS REAR END PINGED BY THE LOCOMOTIVE-- AND THE FEDERALE TRUCK OBLITERATED. 
LOGAN'S LIMO COMES TO A STOP ON THE OTHER SIDE. Logan looks back through the moving freight cars at-- 
Pierce and the remaining Reavers, stuck until it passes. It's a long train. 
EXT./INT. LIMO - RURAL HIGHWAY - DAY 
Logan's battered limo racing at 120 mph. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                  39. 
Logan's eyes darting to his rearview, peeled for any sign of Reavers. He glances back at -- 
LAURA, beside Charles, her gaze fixed out the window.

OLIVE But on Monday, when Rhi asked me how my weekend was... 
INT. HALLS OF BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY 
Olive and Rhi walk, with books in hand, to class - weaving in and out of people. 
OLIVE It was nothing short of perfection. 
RHIANNON Details, bitch. Wait, first I need a scope of reference. Who would play him in the movie of your life? 
OLIVE Ryan Gosling, definitely. 
RHIANNON That works. Spill. 
OLIVE He was charming. A real gentleman. 
RHIANNON Are you going to see him again? 
OLIVE Probably not. It was just one of those weekends. 
RHIANNON The whole weekend? 
OLIVE Yeah. 
Rhiannon suddenly stops and twirls Olive to face her. 
RHIANNON Wait a minute. You didn't... 
OLIVE No, of course not. 
RHIANNON (VERY LOUDLY) You fucking liar! You totally lost your virginity to him. 
Pedestrian students stop in their tracks to stare at them. 
OLIVE I did not. 
RHIANNON YES YOU DID, YOU LYING FUCKING WHORE! 
Olive grabs her and drags her forward, interrupting the show. 
RHIANNON (CONT'D) Tell me everything and spare me the coquettish `just-the-tip' bullshit. (MORE) 
RHIANNON (CONT'D) I know you did it! I know you let him put it inside you, so just TELL ME! 
OLIVE I'm not that kind of girl. 
RHIANNON The kind that does it or the kind that does it like a fucking porn star and then doesn't have the balls to talk about it? 
Rhi drags her into the -- 
INT. GIRLS' ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
-- and abrasively, gets up in Olive's face. 
RHIANNON I want every perverted detail. NOW, bitch. 
Pressured, Olive lies. 
OLIVE Okay. Fine. We did it. 
RHIANNON You lost your virginity! Fucking finally! Now, you're a super-slut like me! 
OLIVE Rhi. Blowing Peter Tolliver once behind the Pizza Hut doesn't make you a super-slut. 
RHIANNON There were people walking past. Whatever, this isn't about me. This is about YOU. What did you let him do? 
OLIVE (V.O.) I started piling on lie after lie. It was like setting up Jenga.

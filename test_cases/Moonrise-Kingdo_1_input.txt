EXT. LAKE SHORE. DUSK 
Sam twists a stick with a shoelace in kindling and builds a small camp-fire circled with rocks. He cooks two fish with bologna in a frying pan over a camp-fire. He throws in a dash of salt, grinds some pepper, and flips the fish in the air. He holds out a bite on a spatula to Suzy sitting on a log next to him. She tastes it. She looks surprised and nods ENTHUSIASTICALLY: 
SUZY Very good. You know a lot about camping, don't you? 
SAM (STIFFENING) I'm a Khaki Scout. It's what I'm trained for. 
Sam points to one of the patches on his sash. It has fried eggs and bacon on it. 
SAM Anyway, I used to be. 
Sam serves the fish onto two tin plates. He says as they eat with folding forks: 
SAM We can feed your cat the guts and eyeballs. 
Sam points to a pile of bloody organs and bones on a page of newspaper. Suzy frowns. 
SUZY That's OK. He only eats cat food. 
Suzy points to a cardboard box. Sam looks inside. It is filled with ten cans of cat food. Sam raises an eyebrow. 
SAM What else did you bring? We should make an inventory. 
SUZY OK. 
Sam flips open a small, spiral-bound note-book. 
SAM Go ahead. 
Suzy opens the top of her portable record player. She displays it like a salesman. 
SUZY This is my record player. It works with batteries. Actually, it belongs to my little brother Lionel. I left him a note. Do you like music? 
Sam nods and makes a note. Suzy opens her leather folder. There are three L.P. records in it. She takes out one by a French singer. 
SUZY This is my favorite record album. My godmother gave it to me for my birthday. She lives in France. 
Sam nods and makes another note. Suzy opens her suitcase. It is filled to the brim with hard-back copies of fantasy books. It contains no other items of any kind (including clothing). 
SUZY These are my books. I like stories with magic powers in them. Either in kingdoms on earth or on foreign planets. Also, time-travel, if they make it realistic. Usually, I prefer a girl hero, but not always. I couldn't bring all of them because it got too heavy. You can borrow any you want. 
Sam nods and makes another note. Suzy produces a few more ITEMS: 
SUZY I also brought my lefty scissors because I'm left-handed, my toothbrush, some rubber bands, extra batteries, and my binoculars, as you know. I forgot my comb. 
Sam surveys the entire collection of articles. He scratches his head. 
SAM That's it? No mess-kit? No flashlight? No canteen? No waterproof matches? Didn't you get the packing list I sent you in my last letter? 
SUZY (FROWNS) I thought that's what you're supposed to bring. I don't own a canteen. 
Pause. Sam shrugs. He smiles. 
SAM That's OK. We can share. 
Sam picks up one of the books. It is called The Girl from Jupiter. There is an illustration on the cover of a young, alien princess with glittering tears on her cheeks. Sam examines the other books in the suitcase. He looks slightly puzzled. 
SAM These are all library books. In my school you're only allowed to check-out one at a time. Some of these are going to be overdue. 
Sam hesitates. He suddenly realizes something. He asks BLUNTLY: 
SAM Do you steal? 
Silence. Suzy nods reluctantly. Sam looks confused. 
SAM Why? You're not poor. 
Suzy stares at the books. She absently brushes some dust off them. She rearranges them slightly. She says finally: 
SUZY I might turn some of them back in one day. I haven't decided yet. I know it's bad. I think I just took them to have a secret to keep. Anyway, for some reason, it makes me feel in a better mood sometimes. 
Sam thinks about this. He leans his chin against his fist. He SAYS SERIOUSLY:

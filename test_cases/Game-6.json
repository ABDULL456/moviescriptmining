{"train": "GAME 6 \nWritten by \nDon DeLillo \nRevised Draft \nMay 18, 2004 \nINT. LOFT APARTMENT - MANHATTAN - MORNING \nSTEVEN SCHWIMMER, a drama critic, asleep on his bed. He wears a sleep mask. The bed is a mattress on a makeshift platform. \nPapers strewn on the floor. \nAn exercise bike. \nA desk with and old manual typewriter, reference works, periodicals, Styrofoam cups. \nA cast-off sofa with pants, shirts, sweater, underwear and socks tossed haphazardly on the cushions and arms. \nA counter that sets apart the kitchen area. A portable TV set on the counter. The remains of dinner for one. \nA row of stacked cardboard boxes with mail spilling out on the floor. Boxes are labeled in crayon: HATE MAIL. \nA coffee table with a candle nub in a saucer and six gleaming rounds of ammunition scattered next to a Llama Comanche .357 Magnum with a checkered walnut stock -- overall length, nine and a quarter inches. \nA Port-O-San toilet, about seven feet high, orange, scarred and dented -- scavenged from a construction site. \nA snapshot on the bedside table. It's a blurry picture of Steven holding a cat. Steven wears a peaked cap, and a shadow falls across his face. Next to the picture is a clock radio, which comes on with a buzz as the clock shows nine AM. \nRADIO ANNOUNCER begins to speak -- \nLONE EAGLE (V.O.) (softly) Traffic flowing smoothly on the \nDeegan right now but if you're lucky enough to have a ticket for tonight's game, be sure to leave early because it's going to be bumper to bumper. \nSteven does not stir. \nEXT. LOFT BUILDING                                            2 teven's loft is in an old squat building on 47th Street near Twelfth Avenue. The structure looks abandoned. Graffiti everywhere. Entranceway filled with debris. \nLONE EAGLE (V.O.) Another day of traffic. Traffic everywhere I look. Cars stop and move and stop again. People sit at the wheel thinking their thoughts. \nEXT. UNITED NATIONS PLAZA APTS - - MORNING The shimmering glass facade of the United Nations Plaza Apartments at 48th Street and First Avenue. A man visible at a window on one of the high floors, a cup of coffee in his hand. \nLONE EAGLE (V.O.) Day in, day out. Red light, green light. Traffic on the major arteries and traffic in the little veins. \nFrom his POV we see the traffic below creeping along, nearly at a standstill. \nLONE EAGLE (V.O.) Cars, vans, taxis, trucks, limos, Mopeds, bikes and buses. Emergency vehicles screaming and wailing. Birth and death, walk and don't walk. \nThe man takes a sip of coffee. \nLONE EAGLE (V.O.) Traffic yesterday, today and tomorrow. Bumper to bumper, soul to soul. This is Lone Eagle over and out. \nNICKY You know about Adele. \nJOANNA What about her? \nNICKY She's dying. \nJOANNA She died. \nNICKY I talked to her two days ago. \nJOANNA Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course. \nNICKY Our Peter? \nJOANNA Peter Redmond. They found out why he can't remember his lines. There's something living in his brain. A parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie. \nNICKY Can he get through it? \nJOANNA They're watching him closely. There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And that's not all. \nNICKY I've got bigger problems, Joanna. Personal problems. \nJOANNA That's not all, Nicky. I've been backing your plays for fifteen years. And I've never been more depressed. \nNICKY About what? \nJOANNA S teven Schwimmer. The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan. \nNICKY (hiding his concern) Look. All I want is a haircut. I'm not worried about this guy. \nJOANNA Ever since he started reviewing the Broadway theater, nobody in this business has been worried about anything else. \nNICKY They can send their heartless brilliant boy-critic. There's a much bigger thing going on than tonight's opening. \nJOANNA What? \nNICKY The Red Sox \nJOANNA You mean the World Series? I thought the Red Sox were winning. \nNICKY Three games to two. But if you know their history, you realize there's a tragedy in the making. I've been carrying this franchise on my back since I was six years old. \nJOANNA It can't be all that personal. \nJoanna enters the walk-in closet to finish undressing and get a nightdress. \nNICKY If you have a team you've followed all your life, and they raise your hopes and crush them, and lift them and crush them, do you want me to tell you what it's like? It's like feeling your childhood die over and over.     J JOANNA I mean Nicky, really, no. \nNicky follows her into the closet, still in his shirt and boxer shorts. \nJOANNA I'm proud of this play. It's so different from anything you've done. \nNICKY This is how we've managed to last. \nJOANNA We're able to surprise each other. \nDRIVER I am sitting here five years in traffic. It is one continuous traffic since I arrive. Why must it be? \nA taxi pulls up alongside. Nicky notices the young woman in the rear seat. It is his daughter Laurel. He opens his window. \nNICKY Laurel, stay there. (to his driver) Keep the meter running. And try to stay abreast. \nNicky leaves his taxi and gets into Laurel's. \nINT. SECOND TAXI Nicky pushes in next to her. Laurel is eighteen, slightly overweight, with a pleasant and expressive face. She is carrying books in a nylon haversack. \nNICKY I never see you anymore. Where are you all day? \nLAUREL I go to college. I thought you knew. \nNICKY Do you want to get some coffee? \nLAUREL I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about. \nNICKY What do you want to talk about? I'll talk about anything. What's this? \nNicky lifts a small radio and headset out of her bag. \nLAUREL I'm seeing your play tonight, remember? \nNICKY Why do you need a radio? \nLAUREL So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer? \nNICKY That's completely crazy. \nLAUREL Is it? \nNICKY Don't talk like that. How prominent? What are you implying? \nLAUREL She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee' \nNICKY (indicating driver) And he hears it the same time I hear it? What happened to family secrets? \nDriver's nameplate --- \nTABATTABI ABULHASSAN \nLAUREL Mother is totally, you know, upset. \nNICKY Abulhassas, we'll be getting out here. \nNicky pays the driver. \nEXT. THE STREET Nicky stands alongside the first taxi and pays his original driver. Laurel reluctantly exits the second taxi. \nINT. COFFEE SHOP \n47th Street between First and Second Avenue. \nNicky and Laurel enter the coffee shop they are greeted by the owner, a hefty Greek named GEORGE. \nStreet level. A glimpse of the bronze statue called \"Taxi on Park Avenue\" -- a man with and attache case and raincoat, hailing a cab. The real people hailing cabs, well-dressed men and women striding along with briefcases -- purposeful, successful. \nINT. TAXI Nicky rides again. \nNICKY It's life, it's taxis. People trying to make contacts, make deals, meet their lovers. Taxis are sexy. You can't have Manhattan without taxis. I was proud of my taxi. I kept my taxi clean. \nNicky shifts his gaze. He sees Elliot Litvak slinking across the street, looking faintly unclean and shows a trace of a smile. He watches Elliot enter the lobby of the Chemical Bank. \nINT. BANK Elliot is at a cash machine, making an elaborate transaction. \nNicky appears, approaching the adjacent machine. Elliot sees him. \nELLIOT Nicky. I was thinking about you. I went to the preview last night. \nNICKY I don't want to hear about it. \nNicky attends to his own transaction. \nELLIOT (whispering) A lovely piece of theater. Small but important. \nNICKY Shut up, Elliot. \nELLIOT Quietly effective. \nNicky takes his cash and begins to move away. \nWe don't appreciate what they've built for us. We're artists who are too dumb to see that this is the peak moment of Western culture. \nNICKY You're an artist. I'm a craftsman. \nELLIOT Press a button and they give us money. \nNICKY Ride with me. We need a haircut. \nINT. TAXI \nStalled between Park and Madison. The driver has opened the door and is standing just outside the cab, trying to determine the cause of delay. \nELLIOT (whispering) How is Lillian? I haven't seen her. \nNICKY She wants a divorce. \nELLIOT Don't talk like that. \nNICKY It's over, finished and done with. \nELLIOT That sounds so final. But are we really surprised? \nNICKY I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen. \nELLIOT But didn't we know it would happen? \nNICKY Don't needle me, Elliot. Tell me how bad you feel. We're suppose to feel bad together. This is what friends do. \nELLIOT (whispering) Joanna Bourne. So rich and crisp. This woman lets you touch her body? You put your hands on her personal parts? \nELLIOT What do I exude? \nNICKY Suffering. You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread. \nELLIOT Tonight you find out what it means to suffer. \nNICKY Tonight. What's tonight? \nELLIOT Shit. They don't have any carrot soup. \nNICKY You mean because What's-His-Name. \nELLIOT You will suffer because he is in the theater. And you will suffer a thousandfold when his review appears. \nNICKY It's just a review. \nELLIOT It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous. \nNICKY What's the fuss? I don't get it. \nELLIOT That's what I said eighteen months ago. \nNICKY What happened eighteen months ago? \nELLIOT Before his Broadway days. He reviewed the one-act I did at the Fulton Fish Market. We did this play at four AM, outdoors in the rain. One performance. For the fish handlers. \nNICKY And he was there? \nELLIOT Steven Schwimmer. I memorized every word of this review. \nNICKY That's awful. \nELLIOT I recite it to myself with masochistic relish. \nNICKY A year and a half later? You're still brooding? \nA patron approaches the table and stares at Nicky with a fixed grin of crazed recognition. \nMAN Yessirree Bob! Yessisree Bob! \nNicky's jaw becomes set and he pours himself a glass of wine as the man backs off. \nELLIOT You don't know about obscure writers, Nicky. How we have our anger to nurture and love. Our murderous fantasies for any amount of fame, money , power and sex. \nThe waitress comes by. She is Paisley Porter, attractive, in her mid-twenties. \nPAISLEY Guys ready to order? \nELLIOT Paisley Porter. I didn't know you were waiting tables. \nPAISLEY Elliot? \nELLIOT (to Nicky) This is a great young out-of-work actress. \nAISLEY Elliot Litvak. Have you been ill? And Mr. Rogan. How nice. \nEXT. THE STREET About a dozen people gathered together including several diamond merchants in their beards, black suits and fur hats. They are watching the man in the cutaway dancing with his cloth doll. Someone places a donation in the cigar box. From the tape player: \"Dancing in the Dark.\" \nElliot ends up near the Gotham Book Mart, on the north side of the street. Nicky looks right past him into the bookstore window. He sees something that interests him. \nELLIOT Where are you going? \nNICKY Don't wait Efor me. \nELLIOT What about the haircut? \nINT. GOTHAM BOOK MART Nicky walks along the main aisle, looking at a woman standing in the poetry nook. \nOnly a few people in the shop. \nHe enters the back room and gets a glimpse of a woman walking through the opposite doorway back into the main room. \nHe squeezes past a browser and looks through the doorway. Someone is just leaving the shop. \nHe walks to the rear of the store, where the office is located. The door is open, the room is empty. \nHe re-enters the main room and sees a woman seated on the top step of the stairway that leads to the basement stacks. Her back is to Nicky and she is reading a book. He approaches slowly and then squats by the doorway to get a closer look at her. \nShe turns. It is Paisley Porter. \nINT. GOTHAM BOOK MART - A MOMENT LATER Nicky and Paisley in a corner of the back room. \nNICKY You keep slipping away. How do you do that? \nPAISLEY I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows. \nNICKY I was all noise. Played the radio loud. Battled constantly with my brother and sister. Here I am, world. \nPAISLEY I hear good things about the new play. \nNICKY So do I. Over and over. \nPAISLEY Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously. \nNICKY Would you like to meet him? \nPAISLEY He doesn't want to meet some out-of- work ingenue. \nNICKY I'm trying to prolong our afternoon. In case you haven't noticed. \nAISLEY The fact is, I have to get going. \nNICKY Is it true? \nPAISLEY Is what true? \nNICKY He wears a disguise. \nPAISLEY Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone. \nNICKY But you're his friend. \nWide of the theater. Nicky says goodbye to Paisley. \nReverse angle, Elliot watches them from across the street. \nicky goes back inside the theatre. Paisley walks west on 47th street. \nElliot waits for a moment, then follows her. \nINT. STEVEN SCHWIMMER'S LOFT The Port-O-San. Steven emerges and goes to the stacked cardboard boxes against the wall. His hate mail. He is wearing a bath towel like a prayer shawl over his sweat clothes. \nHe drags one of the boxes to the ratty armchair. He sits in the chair by the filthy window that looks west toward the early-setting sun. \nHe takes a letter from the box, opens it, reads it, lets it fall to the floor. Takes another letter, opens it -- \nThere is a knock at the door. \nSteven tenses, does not move. \nAnother knock. \nHe moves warily toward the door. \nPAISLEY (V.O.) Steven, it's me. Will you open please. \nSteven releases the dead-bolt lock and opens the door. \nSTEVEN You've come to me. I wanted to believe you would one day. \nPAISLEY I haven't come to you. \nSTEVEN But you're here. So you must have come to me. \nINT. STEVEN SCHWIMMER'S LOFT - A LITTLE LATER \nSteven is back in the chair by the window. Paisley nervously prowls the loft. \nPAISLEY In other words I never understood until today how much pain and anxiety you've been causing with your reviews. Steven, it's so unfair. \nSTEVEN Of course it's unfair. The truth is always unfair. Why do you think I live this way? Hiding out. Stealing electricity from a lamp post. Because people who write the truth are outcasts of society. I can't live openly, in a nice clean doorman building, with my name on the mailbox. They'd come after me in packs. \nPAISLEY Not if you stopped hurting people. Write the truth gently. \nSTEVEN The truth is never gentle. Listen to me carefully. Each of us lives in the thinnest possible wrapping of wishes and dreams. Truth is the force that penetrates this wispy skin. It hurts and maims. reaching down to clutch a fistful of letters) Look how they hate me for telling the truth. It's an education, Paisley. The College of Raw Nerves. (MORE) \nSTEVEN(cont'd) Letters dripping blood. Cries of revenge. \nPAISLEY Yes. I've seen your victims. One past and one future. I thought I might convince you to reconsider. \nSTEVEN And I thought, at last, she's here, she wants me. \nPAISLEY I don't want you, Steven. \nPaisley moves towards the door. \nTEVEN Stay. Teach me to be compassionate. \nMICHAEL So I know who I'm letting in. \nNicky leaves the apartment. \nEXT. THE STREET The man in the cutaway dances with his doll. The tape machine plays \"In The Still of the Night. \n\" The street is completely empty except for the dancer. Nicky, a small paper bag in his hand, reenters his father's building. \nINT. MICHAEL ROGAN'S LIVING ROOM The room bears some resemblance to the living room set at the Barrymore. Michael sits at the end of the sofa, weary. Nicky is taking an athletic bandage -- about four feet long and three inches wide -- out of the package. \nHe sits in a chair that is set perpendicular to Michael's end of the sofa, so that Nicky is looking at his father in profile. \nMICHAEL `Why doesn't he come live with us?' Because everything is here. \nNICKY I know, Pop. \nMICHAEL I'm lucky they don't knock down the building. It could happen anytime. And everything worth remembering is right here. \nNICKY I think the building's okay. At least for the time being. \nMICHAEL You didn't think it was okay when you lived here. You wanted to get out so fast I thought you were running a marathon. \nNICKY Normal boy's ambition. I like coming back. You know that. \nMICHAEL You tell your friends your father used to work the docks. Callused hands. But you had an attitude when you were growing up that wasn't easy for your mother and me to understand. \nNicky is gradually unbuttoning his father's shirt so that he can wrap the bandage around the old man's chest and back. \nE \nNICKY I was in a hurry to do big things, make big mistakes. Any mistakes were okay as long as it was big. But I'm trying to see these things clearly and honestly. That's the play they're going to kill starting tonight. There's a guy out there getting ready to rip it apart. And that's us. Who we were and where we come from. \nMICHAEL So what are you going to do about it? \nNICKY What do you want me to do? \nMICHAEL Show him who we are. \nNicky takes off the shirt. \nMichael struggles out of his T-shirt and we see that he is wearing the elastic bandage he thought he had lost. \nHe is sitting with his head tilted up, eyes closed, and is unaware that he is wearing the bandage. \nNicky takes the new bandage, winds it tightly and puts it back in the box. \nHis father has gone to sleep. \nEXT. STREET BUILDING It is dark and cold. Nicky emerges and walks west, diagonally across the street, to a barbershop on the other side of Ninth Avenue. \nlliot is on the stoop waiting for him. \nINT. THE BARBER SHOP Nicky sits in the barber chair. Elliot pulls up a customer's chair and sits with his back to the mirror, more or less facing Nicky. The barber, an elderly hawk-eyed man named Dodgie, begins his preparations for Nicky's haircut. \nNICKY He carries a gun. \nELLIOT Keep going west. Last building before the river. \nNICKY How do you Eknow. \nLLIOT Paisley Porter. \nNICKY What do you mean? \nELLIOT About an hour and a half ago. I saw her come out of a place. She said she was visiting a friend. But she wouldn't tell me who. \nNICKY Had to be him. \nELLIOT She was very evasive. \nNicky gets out of the chair. Dodgie removes the sheet for him and Elliot smooths down his clothes and hair, like a pair of grooms attending a warrior. \nNicky goes to the cabinet, gets the gun. He returns to the chair. \nNICKY I'm enjoying this more every minute. \nElliot takes an after-dinner candy out of his pocket -- the candy he pocketed in the Italian restaurant after lunch. He blows the lint off and eats it. \nDODGIE How do you want the sideburns. \nNICKY Elegant and refined. \nEXT. SHEA STADIUM \nCrowds of people pouring down the ramps from the train station, hurrying, late. \nThe umpire's room -- six men nibbling cookies, smoking a last- minute cigarette, adjusting equipment. \nAn unidentified room somewhere in there lower reaches of the stadium. Twenty cases of Great Western champagne stacked and ready for the postgame celebration. \nINT. STEVEN SCHWIMMER'S LOFT Steven shaving. He does it symmetrically. A stroke under the left sideburn; a stroke under the right sideburn. Left side of jaw; right side of jaw. \nSteven standing in his shorts, applying putty to his jaw to make it square. Then a false mustache and a wavy blond hairpiece. Then a thick bronze makeup paste. \nSteven in front of a full-length mirror near the bed, putting on a bulletproof vest, which gives him a solid appearance, bulking his caved-in chest and concealing his pot belly. \nSteven putting on black trousers, a brash shirt with a bright bow tie, which he tips slightly askew. A pair of black and white shoes with elevator heels. Then his shoulder holster. \nSteven leaning over the coffee table, inserting bullets into the chamber of the revolver. \nWith the gun in his holster, he stands in front of the mirror. Takes the gun out, aims it, puts it back in the holster. \nDoes a dazzling karate move. \nSteven putting on a metallic rayon sport coat. A long silk scarf. \nWe see a handsome, dashing young man. \nHe puts on a pair of dark glasses and heads for the door. \nEXT. THE BARRYMORE pening night crowd. The sidewalk is mobbed. Limousines and taxis pulling up. Men in tuxedos, other men scalping tickets. \nGRAINY IMAGE Filling the screen. Actual footage. A man in a parachute coming down on an expanse of grass. It is the infield at Shea Stadium. He carries a sign reading \"Let's Go, Mets\". Security men hustle the parachutist off the field and into the Mets dugout as the game begins. \nINT. MANION'S OLD TIMER TAVERN We see that the image is on a TV screen over the bar. The place is crowded, a neighborhood tavern. \nNear the door: Nicky embracing the owner, a beefy man named Georgie. People coming and going. \nNICKY Georgie. \nGEORGIE Nicky, God bless. You're well? Your family's well? That's all that counts. \nNICKY Are you absolutely sure? \nGEORGIE Hey. I love this guy. Be good. Stay well. I'm serious: Give my best to everybody. \nThey embrace. \nFaces lining the bar. \nTV images from the game. \nPeople at tables standing occasionally for a better look at the game. \nINT. MANION'S OLD TIMER TAVERN - THE TABLE -LATER Nicky sits facing Toyota and Matthew. A young waiter is placing their food on the table. \nMATTHEW What happens if somebody comes in here right now and shoots you? \nNICKY This place becomes famous. Tour buses. Blind people feeling around for bullet holes in the wall. \nTOYOTA You see what you're doing, don't you? \nNICKY What am I doing? \nTOYOTA You're charming the boy. \nNICKY Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question. \nTOYOTA Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury. \nNICKY That's my cousin, Angelo. \nINT. THE BARRYMORE THEATER - DRESSING ROOM The actor Peter Redmond and the director Jack Haskins. A second actor, who is about fifteen, witnesses the exchange. \nJACK This could be it. \nPETER This could be it. \nJACK This could be it. \nPETER This could be it. \nJACK Does it feel comfortable? \nPETER Does what feel comfortable? \nJACK This could be it. \nTOYOTA And the people he hurts the most are the people who love him. Despite who he is and what he does for a living. We're always saying we want to take control of our lives. You don't want to take control. You want to lose control. Jesus knows it. \nNicky is standing again but he's not looking at the TV screen this time. His gaze is directed at someone who has just entered the tavern. \nA woman stands at the entrance, middle-aged and somewhat anxious, looking for someone. She is Lillian Rogan, Nicky's wife. \nNICKY It's a complicated subject. \nTOYOTA It's a simple subject. \nNicky gestures that he will be right back. \nINT. MANION'S OLD TIMER TAVERN - THE BOOTH LILLIAN Your father said you might be here. \nNICKY Two-all after six. \nLILLIAN I've been looking for you because I want to let you know what's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column. \nNICKY We stranded five runners in the first two innings. This will come back to haunt us. \nLILLIAN I want to be fair-minded, Nicky. \nNICKY All right. What's been going on? \nLILLIAN I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer. \nNICKY How prominent? \nLILLIAN He has his own submarine. I'll be getting everything that matters. I'll get New York and I'll get Connecticut. \nHappy roars from the bar crowd. \nA young waiter arrives with menus. \nNICKY I'll have whatever she's having. \nLILLIAN (to Waiter) I don't want to be responsible for his food. Just a small green salad. And a Perrier. \nNICKY Bring me the bay scallops with mercury poisoning. \nWAITER Yessiree, Bob. \nNICKY Get the hell out of here. I don't want you bringing our food. Send a real waiter. \nINT. MANION'S OLD TIMER TAVERN - THE BAR TV images: action on the field. \nCrowd at the bar. Noise like a massive pulse beat. Bar crowd picks up chant from stadium crowd. \nBAR VOICES Rog-errrr! Dew-eeey! \nINT. MANION'S OLD TIMER TAVERN - THE BOOTH - LATER Dinner has arrived with a bottle of wine. A cigarette burns in the ashtray in front of Lillian. \nNICKY Opening night, Lillian. \nLILLIAN Who the hell cares? \nScoreboard: Red Sox lead 3-2 in the seventh inning. \nEXT. THE STREET Nicky with one arm raised, hailing a taxi. He and Lillian kiss sweetly. \nA taxi pulls up and Lillian gets in. She and Nicky hold hands through the window. \nLILLIAN You look awful, sweetheart. Get a haircut. Get a lawyer. \nAcross the street, the man in the cutaway is dancing with his doll. The tape machine plays, \"In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning.\" \nINT. MANION'S OLD TIMER TAVERN Nicky rejoins Toyota and Matthew. He carries the wine bottle and his glass. \nMATTHEW Great game. Red Sox are winning. \nNICKY They're always winning. Until they lose. \nTOYOTA Your problem is you take the easy way out. Losing is easy. \nNICKY Winning is easy. Losing is complicated. It's a lifetime's work. \nTOYOTA It may be work but it's not honest work. Faith is the real work. \nMATTHEW Clemens has a blister. Look. They're pinch-hitting for him. \nTV SCREEN \nMike Greenwell comes up to hit for Clemens. Two pitches, two strikes. \nNICKY He's a twenty-four-game winner. He pitches seven solid innings. We scratch out a one-run lead. Of course he gets a blister. Of course they put up Greenwell even though Baylor's sitting on the bench. Of course Greenwell strikes out. \nThird pitch. Greenwell strikes out. \nINT. MANION'S OLD TIMER TAVERN - THE TABLE TOYOTA You made him strike out. You wished it on him. You want to lose. It's too hard for you to believe in something. It's hard to have faith. It's hard Nwork to trust somebody. \nNICKY (reciting) \"It looked extremely rocky for the Boston nine that day.\" \nTOYOTA You're afraid to risk believing. Believe in them. Believe in your self. Take a risk. It will humanize you as a person. \nNICKY I want to believe. \nTOYOTA If you believed, you wouldn't be walking around with a handgun in your belt. What does that tell me? You want to make the night come down. \nINT. THE BARRYMORE \niew from the wings. Jack Haskins and Renee Simon looking on. \nThe stage. Peter Redmond as the Father sits at the end of the sofa. The fifteen-year-old actor who plays the Son approaches him, sitting on a footstool and leaning close. \nFATHER I always thought a night's sleep is what you get for a hard day's work. But these last weeks I lie there helpless. Hour after hour. I've come close to praying for the first time since I was your age. Pray to God to put Sme out. \nSON I talked to the doctor again, Pop. He said she's not getting any better. He wants to talk to you. I think he means right away. \nFATHER How bad is she? \nSON This could be it. \nNICKY Let's see what Henderson does. \nTV SCREEN \nDave Henderson stands at the plate to lead off the Red Sox tenth. INT. MANION'S OLD TIMER TAVERN - THE TABLE A real waiter arrives -- obese, slow-moving, with hair curling out of his ears -- and he brings ice cream for Matthew, coffee for Toyota and a stinger for Nicky. \nNICKY Finally, I get a waiter who doesn't know \"Macbeth\". \nWAITER But I know you, don't I? I seen you on a poster in the theater district. I'll think of your name in just a -- \nNicky lifts his hand to stop the man. \nNICKY You know- \nBAR CROWD Hen-duuu! \nThen a moan and deep silence. \nNicky disengages from the altercation and looks at the TV screen. \nTV SCREEN \nDave Henderson has hit a home run and the Red Sox now lead 4- \nINT. MANION'S OLD TIMER TAVERN - THE TABLE \nToyota and Matthew are jubilant, and Nicky is quick to join them. It is the only lively table in the place. \nMATTHEW People are dependable. \nTOYOTA Life is good. \nNICKY Baseball is life. \nTV SCREEN \nThe Red Sox push across another run when Barrett singles, driving home Boggs. \nNICKY Enjoy your ice cream, kid. When you're an old man it'll come back to you. The same deep sweet soft toothy taste. And you'll remember where you were and what you saw. \nScoreboard shows: Red Sox 5, Mets 3, going into the last of the tenth. \nINT. THE BARRYMORE he theater is nearly emptied out. A few people still heading toward the exits. Laurel Rogan remains seated, wearing her headset, listening to the ball game. She is concentrating deeply, fists clenched. \nOnly one other person is still seated, three rows back. It is Steven and he is looking intently at Laurel. \nThe house lights dim. \nINT. MANION'S OLD TIMER TAVERN Toyota, Matthew and Nicky are huddled closely, watching the screen. Matthew is seated now and Nicky leans over him from behind, framing the boy's head in his hands so that Matthew's attention will be directed unswervingly to the action on the screen. \nThe bar crowd is somber. \nNicky drops his mob accent. \nNICKY This is something no one has been privileged to see in almost seventy years. Very few people now alive can say that they have seen what you are about to see, Matthew. The Red Sox win a World Series. This is deeply, intensely personal. All the mistakes I've made, all the envy, fear and violence that's encased in this little envelope we call a person -- all washed away in the next few minutes. And your grandmother knows why. \nBob Stanley trots in from the bullpen. \nNICKY (O.S.) It's Stanley. It's the Steamer. Fate has spoken to this man in the depths of the night. \nMATTHEW (O.S.) What did it say? \nNICKY (O.S.) A thousand things. \nINT. MANION'S OLD TIMER TAVERN - THE TABLE MATTHEW You're hurting my head. \nNicky releases his grip on Matthew's head. \nThe bar crowd begins to chant. \nBAR VOICES Mookie, Mookie, Mookie, Mookie! \nTV SCREEN \nMookie Wilson stands in against Bob Stanley. \nMATTHEW (O.S.) We're still winning. That's what counts. \nFirst pitch to Wilson -- he swings and misses. \nSilence from the bar crowd, cheers from Nicky's table. \nSecond pitch to Wilson -- he fouls it off. No balls, two strikes. \nSound begins to fade. Wilson fouls off a pitch. Wilson takes a ball, outside. Wilson fouls off another pitch. \nAbsolute, unnatural silence. \nStanley prepares to throw. The silence suddenly breaks and for the first time we hear the TV Announcers clearly. \nANNOUNCER 1 The Sox are one pitch away. \nANNOUNCER 2 One pitch away. \nANNOUNCER 1 Stanley's getting ready. \nANNOUNCER 2 This could be it. \nANNOUNCER 1 This could be it. \nINT. MANION'S OLD TIMER TAVERN - THE TABLE Nicky recognizing the line from his play. \nNICKY This could be it! \nMATTHEW This could be it! \nTOYOTA This could be it! \nNICKY This could be it! \nNicky is charged with excitement, hearing the line as a favorable sign, a positive connection between the play and the game. \nNICKY Classic. \nSECOND MAN Scintillating. \nFIRST MAN I still don't believe it. \nNICKY Have to hurry back. \nSECOND MAN Hurry back. Hurry back to what? \nNICKY Eleventh inning. What else? \nFIRST MAN (zipping up) I think you're a little confused. Nothing personal friend. \nNICKY What are you talking about? \nFIRST MAN What are we talking about? \nNICKY Yes. What are you implying? \nThe second man approaches the urinal. \nSECOND MAN Game six is history,pal. \nNICKY You're not making sense. \nFIRST MAN We're not making sense. \nSECOND MAN Did you see Mookie hit the ball? \nNICKY Of course I saw it. \nFIRST MAN Did you see the winning run score? \nNICKY You're not making sense. Make sense. \nNicky throws his paper towel at the men. No one moves. They are trying to interpret this action. \nNICKY You're implying I missed something. What did I Fmiss? \nIRST MAN You missed the boat, Popeye the Sailorman. \nNicky charges the men. He and the First Man wrestle each other into the stall. \nSECOND MAN Hold him till I zip up, Tommy. \nNicky and the First Man are grappling in the stall. Second Man hurriedly washes his hands at the basin. \nNICKY Baseball is life. Life is good. \nAl three men in the stall, wrestling. Nicky has one foot in the bowl as someone's elbow strikes the handles and the toilet flushes. \nINT. MANION'S OLD TIMER TAVERN - THE BAR AREA - A LITTLE 103 LATER \nThe crowd is slowly breaking up. A few people still clustered near the TV sets, which are showing replays. \nSTEVEN If you're wondering about the firearm. \nLAUREL Yes. \nSTEVEN This building is not secure. \nThey are all over the sofa, working on the removal of Steven's shirt. \nINT. THE ENTRANCEWAY Nicky makes his way past the debris. The front door is gone, the inner door smashed and battered -- door knobs gone and locking mechanism ripped out. \nHe starts up the stairs past a dead or sleeping body. \nINT. THE LOFT On the sofa, Laurel is straddling Steven, whose shirt is almost completely off, exposing his bulletproof vest. Laurel is blouseless and barefoot, with her unzipped skirt still on and her bra dangling from one shoulder. \nLAUREL I have this thing where I have to know a person is being honest with me before, you know, I can feel completely free to be myself. \nSTEVEN We're strangers in the night. The last thing we want is honesty. \nLAUREL What do we want? \nSTEVEN Mystery. Deception. \nLAUREL Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy. \nSTEVEN What's sexy? \nLAUREL Knowing who a person is. Down deep. \nSTEVEN Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking? \nLAUREL You won't even tell me your name. What's shocking about a name? \nSteven maneuvers himself into a sitting position so that he and Laurel face each other at equal height and at close quarters. \nSTEVEN Even if the truth requires a certain adjustment? \nSteven begins removing the cosmetic putty around his naturally shallow chin. He uses Laurel's hair clip to scrape his jaw clean. Then he peels off his fake mustache. And borrows Laurel's dangling bra cup to wipe the bronzing agent off his face. \nINT. THE LANDING Nicky stands with his back to Steven's door. His gun is out. He holds it up near his face, muzzle pointed up. \nHe looks at the gun as if it had feelings and personality, and he speaks to it as to a sympathetic friend. \nNICKY I used to go to the movies all the time. (MORE) \nNICKY(cont'd) I saw a hundred situations like this. A man and a gun -- and a locked door. Lee Marvin or Steve McQueen. And I used to say to Lillian because we went to a hundred movies that we saw together or that I saw because she had seen them, and I'd say, `Watch him kick in the door with one kick,' And it might be Steve McQueen or Jeff Chandler, holding the gun up like this, and he would turn and kick the door and it would fly open at once, and I would say to Lillian, `How completely phony. Whoever made this movie has no idea how hard it is to kick in an actual door in real life.' I still love Lillian. But it's not easy to kick in a door. I knew they would lose and they lost, so what are we so upset about? They lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's written on the wind. INT. THE LOFT Laurel is on her feet, backing away slightly. Steven removed his shoes and stands in his stocking feet, noticeably shorter than he'd been earlier. \nHe begins to unstrap the bulletproof vest, causing Laurel to retreat further. \nINT. THE LANDING NICKY These wives named Lillian. I used to say to her, `You don't kick a door once or twice and expect it to open. It's only in the movies a man can kick in a door with such amazing ease. Because a real door requires a tremendous and prolonged pounding before it finally gives way.' He's a great player...how could that ball go through his legs? \nNicky turns, steps back and kicks the door. It opens at once. \nINT. THE LOFT Steven and Laurel are briefly immobilized by shock as the door comes flying open. \nNicky moves toward the candle-lit couple. \nHe shouts into the darkness. \nNICKY YOU'RE DEAD! \nLaurel puts her hand on his shoulder. \nLAUREL What will we talk about? \nNICKY Everything. \nNicky sees one of the New York Magazine ads, Steven Schwimmer's face mounted on the cardboard. He fires three times, wiping out Schwimmer's eyes. \nLAUREL Will I believe you when you tell me something? \nNICKY There's nothing left for me to lie about. \nNicky starts into the darkness only to see Steven emerge from the shadows, his gun lowered. Oddly, he seems distracted by something on another part of the room. He is looking at the TV set on the counter. \nNicky watches him approach the kitchen area. He follows, gun raised. \nSteven sits on a stool to watch TV. \nNicky approaches warily, his gun aimed at Steven's head, which is blue-lit by the TV screen. \nNICKY You're dead. I see you on a morgue slab drained of all fluids. \nLaurel follows at a distance to see what they're so interested in. \nNicky puts the gun muzzle flush against Steven's temple. \nNICKY I see the outline of your body in chalk on this very floor. \nLAUREL (whispering) Daddy, wait. \nSteven is watching slow-motion footage of Bill Buckner missing the slow roller. \nSTEVEN Then they lost? \nNICKY Why does it matter? \nSTEVEN If they lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's all over. \nNICKY Why do you care? \nSTEVEN They're my team. \nNICKY No. They're not your team. They're my team. \nNicky cocks the hammer. \nSTEVEN They're my team, too. I grew up on Boyleston Street. Right by Fenway Park. I went to fifty or sixty games a year. All by myself. I was one of those kids with scabby elbows. I called out to the players. `Look over here. Hi, I'm Steven. My parents are divorced.' \nNICKY I went to college in Boston so I could be near the Red Sox. I took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game. My wife is from Boston. Lillian Ziegler? \nSTEVEN The Red Sox were my world. I surrendered my existence to a team that couldn't win the big one. \n", "test1_input": "WAITER To go to the theater. Wears I don't know what. Make-up, padding. \nNICKY Why? \nWAITER Because he is so deeply hated by so many people in the business. \nELLIOT He has to disguise himself, Nicky. \nWAITER For his own safety and peace of mind. \nThe waiter squeezes past and leaves. \nELLIOT Do you want me to tell you what it was like, reading that review at the newstand with trucks rumbling past and street vendors facing Mecca? \nNICKY What was it like? \nELLIOT I said, `I'm dead'. He killed me. \nINT. RESTAURANT -LATER Elliot standing near the front window, in a shaft of sunlight, examining a white after-dinner candy. He puts it in his pocket for later. P aisley eating lunch at the end of the long table, looking up to see Nicky approach with liqueur and a glass on wine. He sits opposite her, placing the wineglass in front of her. \nNICKY You've worked with Elliot? \nPAISLEY I was in the fish-market play. What happened to him? \nNICKY There was a review. \nPAISLEY I think I remember. \nNICKY So does Elliot. \nPAISLEY Not one of Steven's finer moments. \nNICKY Oh. You know him. \nPAISLEY A little. \nNICKY And he has finer moments now and then. \nPAISLEY He has -- something. A funny little quality I find -- \nNICKY Endearing. \nPAISLEY Engaging. \nNICKY Elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike. \nPAISLEY A little drastic maybe? \nNICKY Say it again. \nPAISLEY What? \nNICKY You know what. \nPAISLEY Alla puttanesca. \n", "test1_true": "INT. THE ENTRANCE WAY - A LITTLE LATER Elliot watches Nicky embrace Giorgio. Nicky carries the tabloid he'd been reading -- the \"Daily News\". Elliot and Nicky stand at the door and watch the whitish mist that continues to linger. \nELLIOT Is it safe? \nNICKY Do we care? \nELLIOT I think we Nought to wait. \nNICKY I say we go. \nELLIOT You say we go? \nNICKY Do not inhale. \nELLIOT I'm not ready. \nNICKY Here we go. \nThey pull up their collars and run outside. \nEXT. STREET - DAY The street is deserted. Nicky holds the newspaper over his face for protection. Each man has an arm in the air, trying to hail a taxi. They are standing near a trash receptacle that carries an advertisement for \"New York Magazine\". It is a reproduction of the cover that we'd glimpsed earlier in Joanna's apartment when her maid was reading the magazine. A furtive man shielding his face with the newspaper -- and a headline about a Phantom. Nicky and Elliot do not see the receptacle. \nA bus comes down the street with a large horizontal ad covering its right side. It is the same ad -- five of them actually, five \"New York Magazine\" covers side by side. Elliot is trying to hail a cab and doesn't notice the ad. As the bus bears down, Nicky steps out of the way, removing the newspaper from his face and getting a clear look at the five photos on the side of the bus -- a man concealing his face with a newspaper. \nNicky reads the text under the logo of \"New York Magazine\". \nTHE PHANTOM WHO HAUNTS BROADWAY \nLearning to hate Steven Schwimmer \nNicky stares after the bus. Another bus comes along, carrying the same ad. \nNicky watches darkly. \nEXT. STREET - LATER This is the diamond district. Store signs reading: \nAntique Jewelry     We Buy Diamonds     Gold Emporium Wholesale Jewelry       All Brand-Name Watches Reduced \nINT. THE TAXI - NICKY AND ELLIOT Nicky is reading the newspaper. The driver is speaking Chinese into his two-way radio. Squawky replies from the dispatcher in machine gun Chinese. \nELLIOT The man has taken over my mind. He's not only out there. He's in my head and I can't get rid of him. I can't write a word without imagining his response. I'm paralyzed as an artist. \nNICKY I don't have the problems that artists have. \nLLIOT You've been saying that for years. \nNICKY What? \nELLIOT (mockingly) `I'm just a professional. A dues- playing member of a guild.' Because you're afraid, Nicky. That's the darkest part of you. You don't think you're good enough. \nNicky lowers the newspaper. \nDriver's nameplate: \nWU LI \n", "test1_id": 2931, "test2_input": "PETER But my parasite is consuming all the new memories.

JACK I heard Borneo. \nRENEE Why do we blame the Third World for our parasites? Maybe he got it in Denver or Minneapolis. \nJACK Maybe he got it in Borneo. \nINT.

I think I can handle the last long speech. \nRENEE Which line, Peter? \nPETER The Son says to the Father, This could be it. \nNICKY And the Father replies? \nPETER That's the line I can't ever, for the life of me remember. I just can't get it. \nJACK It's the same line. The Father simply repeats what the Son says to him. \nRENEE This could be it. \nNICKY This could be it. \nPETER I know it sounds easy. But something happens between the time I hear the line and the time I'm suppose to Jrepeat it. \nACK This could be it. \nPETER (long pause) This could be it. \nJACK Let's work on it. \n", "test2_true": "INT. THE BARRYMORE THEATER - AISLE - A LITTLE LATER Nicky and Paisley Porter make their way out of the theatre. \nAISLEY Do you think he can do it? \nNICKY I don't know. \nPAISLEY He's a very sweet man. \nNICKY Where are you going now? \nPAISLEY Home. \nNICKY Someone waiting for you? \nPAISLEY No one's waiting. \nNICKY There's a certain kind of wounded young man who uses his oddness to get laid. Is that our Steven? \nPAISLEY If I'm sleeping with him, and I haven't said I am, then so what? \nNICKY (quietly) So everything. That's so what. So I begin to hate him. So I want to do him grave harm. \nPAISLEY But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom? \nNICKY I know you both. Enough. How much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy. \nPAISLEY Do you want to talk about doing crazy things. \nNICKY Yes. \nPAISLEY Never mind. \nINT.

A hotel, a high school, brownstones with fire escapes. INT. MICHAEL ROGAN'S KITCHEN Michael, Nicky's father, is making an omelette on the old stove. He is pushing eighty, slow-moving, with a two-day stubble. \nKnock at the door. \nMichael goes to the intercom, inches from the door. \nMICHAEL (into speaker) Who is it? \nNICKY (V.O.) I'm at the door. \nMICHAEL (into speaker) Go way. I'll call a cop. \nNICKY (V.O.) Pop, will you let me in? \nMICHAEL (into speaker) Where the hell are you? \nNICKY (V.O.) Right here. At the door. \nMichael goes to the door and looks through the peephole. \nINTERCUT AS NECESSARY MICHAEL What do you want? \nNICKY It's me. Nicky. \nMICHAEL Nicky comes on Sunday's. \nNICKY Where are your glasses? Go get them. \nMICHAEL If it's you, what are you doing here? \nNICKY I'm on my way to get a haircut. \nICHAEL Where does Nicky get his hair cut? \nNicky stands against the door, speaking softly into the peephole. \nNICKY Across Ninth Avenue. Dodgie's. Where you've been getting your hair cut for fifty years. Where Uncle Billy and Uncle Marty got their hair cut. Where Jim Rorty shot a man for cheating at poker. \nMICHAEL It was rummy, not poker. But I'll take a chance and let you in. \nINT. MICHAEL ROGAN'S KITCHEN - LATER Michael is eating his omelette at a small enamel-topped table in the kitchen. Nicky stands by the boxlike refrigerator, drinking a beer. This is the kitchen that is the centerpiece of the theatre set. The new play is Nicky's young life. \nNICKY It's a constant shock to me, how small this place is. How did we do it? Five people in these little rooms. \nMICHAEL Get yourself something to eat. \nNicky takes some eggs out of the refrigerator. \n", "test3_true": "MICHAEL Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle. \nNICKY Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?' \nMICHAEL You know the answer to that. \nNICKY I do know the answer to that. Why don't we watch the ball game later? We'll go to Mannion's. \nMICHAEL They're only gonna lose. \nNICKY Of course they're gonna lose. We'll watch them lose. What good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand? \nMICHAEL The Red Sox are your problem. I never understood about you and the Red Sox. Everybody rooted for the Yankees. \nNicky is scrambling the eggs. \nNICKY Remember 1949? Last two games of the season. Against the Yankees. The Sox lost on Saturday. Then they lost on Sunday. First I cried for twenty-four hours. Then I had fist- fights the rest of the week. \nMICHAEL It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things. \nNICKY It's all connected, Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember. \nMICHAEL But the son is suppose to stop crying. \nNICKY I could have grown up happy. A Yankee fan. A divorce lawyer. \nNicky sees his father's glasses on a shelf above the stove. He puts them on the table. \nNICKY You'll need these. Tonight. For the play. \nMICHAEL Don't make me sit through one of your plays. \nNICKY Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think. \nMICHAEL Since when did that matter? \nNICKY Let's not start that again. \nMICHAEL My back is killing me. \nNICKY Where's your elastic brace? \nMICHAEL I can't find it. \nNICKY You're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble. \nMICHAEL I lost it. I lose everything. \nNICKY I'll go get you another one. You have to wear it. \nNicky takes a roll off the counter, makes a sandwich for his scrambled eggs, takes a bite and heads for the door. \nNICKY Be right back. Take a good look at me. \nMichael puts on his glasses. \n", "test3_id": 2933}

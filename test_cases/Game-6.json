{"test1_input": "GAME 6 \nWritten by \nDon DeLillo \nRevised Draft \nMay 18, 2004 \nINT. LOFT APARTMENT - MANHATTAN - MORNING \nSTEVEN SCHWIMMER, a drama critic, asleep on his bed. He wears a sleep mask. The bed is a mattress on a makeshift platform. \nPapers strewn on the floor. \nAn exercise bike. \nA desk with and old manual typewriter, reference works, periodicals, Styrofoam cups. \nA cast-off sofa with pants, shirts, sweater, underwear and socks tossed haphazardly on the cushions and arms. \nA counter that sets apart the kitchen area. A portable TV set on the counter. The remains of dinner for one. \nA row of stacked cardboard boxes with mail spilling out on the floor. Boxes are labeled in crayon: HATE MAIL. \nA coffee table with a candle nub in a saucer and six gleaming rounds of ammunition scattered next to a Llama Comanche .357 Magnum with a checkered walnut stock -- overall length, nine and a quarter inches. \nA Port-O-San toilet, about seven feet high, orange, scarred and dented -- scavenged from a construction site. \nA snapshot on the bedside table. It's a blurry picture of Steven holding a cat. Steven wears a peaked cap, and a shadow falls across his face. Next to the picture is a clock radio, which comes on with a buzz as the clock shows nine AM. \nRADIO ANNOUNCER begins to speak -- \nLONE EAGLE (V.O.) (softly) Traffic flowing smoothly on the \nDeegan right now but if you're lucky enough to have a ticket for tonight's game, be sure to leave early because it's going to be bumper to bumper. \nSteven does not stir. \nEXT. LOFT BUILDING                                            2 teven's loft is in an old squat building on 47th Street near Twelfth Avenue. The structure looks abandoned. Graffiti everywhere. Entranceway filled with debris. \nLONE EAGLE (V.O.) Another day of traffic. Traffic everywhere I look. Cars stop and move and stop again. People sit at the wheel thinking their thoughts. \nEXT. UNITED NATIONS PLAZA APTS - - MORNING The shimmering glass facade of the United Nations Plaza Apartments at 48th Street and First Avenue. A man visible at a window on one of the high floors, a cup of coffee in his hand. \nLONE EAGLE (V.O.) Day in, day out. Red light, green light. Traffic on the major arteries and traffic in the little veins. \nFrom his POV we see the traffic below creeping along, nearly at a standstill. \nLONE EAGLE (V.O.) Cars, vans, taxis, trucks, limos, Mopeds, bikes and buses. Emergency vehicles screaming and wailing. Birth and death, walk and don't walk. \nThe man takes a sip of coffee. \nLONE EAGLE (V.O.) Traffic yesterday, today and tomorrow. Bumper to bumper, soul to soul. This is Lone Eagle over and out. \n", "test1_true": "In a corner of the screen -- \nOCTOBER 25, 1986 \nINT. TAXI Stalled in traffic. \nNICKY I used to drive a taxi. \nDRIVER Where you're going, mister? \nNicky glances at the driver's name plate \nKAGANOVICH ANATOLI \nNICKY I used to drive a taxi. \nDRIVER I used to be head of neurosurgery. Big hospital in USSR. This hospital, I'm not kidding. \nNICKY Very big. \nDRIVER I opened thousands of brains. \nNICKY What did you find? \nDRIVER Big mess every time. \nNICKY I loved my taxi. Went twelve hours nonstop. Stopped only to pee. I peed under the Manhattan bridge. Peed many times in parks and playgrounds. \nEXT. STREET CORNER 47th Street and Third Avenue. A man is dancing with a life- size cloth doll. His tape player is on the sidewalk, playing and instrumental version of \"Beautiful Dreamer\" and there is a cigar box for donations. A few people look on from a distance. The man wearing an old cutaway, with running shoes, and the doll has long red tresses and wears a frilly gown. \nNicky emerges from a taxi at the corner and walks rapidly past the dancing man. \nNicky crosses the courtyard to Buchanan Apartments. \nINT. FOYER JOANNA BOURNE reaching for the door. Joanna is fifty-ish, handsome, stylishly dressed. \nINT. BUCHANAN APARTMENT - SECONDS LATER Nicky and Joanna embracing with wordless abandon. \nThey are in the hallway clutching each other, stumbling. The walls on either side are hung with expensive art. \nThey grapple past the living room. Fleeting look at the paintings by Longo and Fischl, a poster by the Guerilla Girls. T he edge of the bedroom. Nicky is crawling into the room and Joanna is hanging on to him, being dragged. They are fully dressed except for one of Joanna's shoes. \nThe bedroom. A Lichtenstein, a Hockney, a silk-screen of Joanna by Andy Warhol. A Jeff Koons piece. Nicky and Joanna roll on the floor until they are halfway under the bed. \nINT. HALLWAY Muffled sounds from the bedroom. We track to: \nThe maid's room. The maid is smoking a cigarette and reading New York magazine. The cover is partly obscured by her hand but we can see a blurry black-and-white photo of a man hurrying along a street with a newspaper over his face, shielding himself from the camera. Over the photo, three words visible: THE PHANTOM WHO -- A second line of type is too small to be legible. \nINT. BEDROOM -- LATER Nicky and Joanna are undressing after the fact, very slowly and distractedly. Joanna stands by a chair near the window. Nicky is on the other side of the bed and he alternates between standing and sitting as he takes off his clothes. \nJOANNA Last night. Alan Albright called me a handsome woman. Second time he's done that. Son of a bitch. \nNICKY I hear Alan's sick. \nJOANNA Alan's very sick. He has to go to New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution. \n", "test1_id": 2931, "test2_input": "Street level. A glimpse of the bronze statue called \"Taxi on Park Avenue\" -- a man with and attache case and raincoat, hailing a cab. The real people hailing cabs, well-dressed men and women striding along with briefcases -- purposeful, successful. \nINT. TAXI Nicky rides again. \nNICKY It's life, it's taxis. People trying to make contacts, make deals, meet their lovers. Taxis are sexy. You can't have Manhattan without taxis. I was proud of my taxi. I kept my taxi clean. \nNicky shifts his gaze. He sees Elliot Litvak slinking across the street, looking faintly unclean and shows a trace of a smile. He watches Elliot enter the lobby of the Chemical Bank. \nINT. BANK Elliot is at a cash machine, making an elaborate transaction. \nNicky appears, approaching the adjacent machine. Elliot sees him. \nELLIOT Nicky. I was thinking about you. I went to the preview last night. \nNICKY I don't want to hear about it. \nNicky attends to his own transaction. \nELLIOT (whispering) A lovely piece of theater. Small but important. \nNICKY Shut up, Elliot. \nELLIOT Quietly effective. \nNicky takes his cash and begins to move away. \nWe don't appreciate what they've built for us. We're artists who are too dumb to see that this is the peak moment of Western culture. \nNICKY You're an artist. I'm a craftsman. \nELLIOT Press a button and they give us money. \nNICKY Ride with me. We need a haircut. \nINT. TAXI \nStalled between Park and Madison. The driver has opened the door and is standing just outside the cab, trying to determine the cause of delay. \nELLIOT (whispering) How is Lillian? I haven't seen her. \nNICKY She wants a divorce. \nELLIOT Don't talk like that. \nNICKY It's over, finished and done with. \nELLIOT That sounds so final. But are we really surprised? \nNICKY I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen. \nELLIOT But didn't we know it would happen? \nNICKY Don't needle me, Elliot. Tell me how bad you feel. We're suppose to feel bad together. This is what friends do. \nELLIOT (whispering) Joanna Bourne. So rich and crisp. This woman lets you touch her body? You put your hands on her personal parts? \n", "test2_true": "They swat each other, half kiddingly, each of them leaning away from the other to prevent being hit in the face. \nEXT. THE STREET A whitish brown mist is building the west. There is a sense of scurrying people. \nINT. TAXI \nThe driver re-enters. \nDRIVER We must abandon. \nNICKY What do you mean, we must abandon? \nDRIVER Ruptured steam pipe. \nELLIOT Ruptured steam pipe. \nDRIVER Asbestos lining. Do not inhale. \nNICKY We must abandon. \nDRIVER Contaminated substance. Very dangerous. Shooting mud. \nNICKY Do not inhale. \nELLIOT We must abandon. \nDRIVER Ruptured steam pipe. \nNICKY Very dangerous. \nELLIOT Asbestos lining. \nNICKY We must abandon. \nELLIOT Do not inhale. \nDriver's name plate -- \nBODENHEIM YEHOSHAFAT \nNicky pays him. \nEXT. THE STREET \nThe driver flees eastward. Nicky and Elliot run across Madison Avenue. A snowstorm of asbestos is shooting out of a man hole cover west of Fifth Avenue, reducing visibility to near zero. Cars and people are white shadows. \nThe two men, with collars raised and hands over heads hurry into a restaurant on 47th Street between Madison and Fifth. INT. RESTAURANT - LATER A small narrow room. Handsome wall paintings -- a Tuscan hill town. Very slow day. \nNicky and Elliot sitting with a carafe of wine, a bottle of mineral water and some bread sticks. Glancing at menus intermittently. \nNICKY I'm trying to think. When did you start looking so terrible? You look awful. \nELLIOT I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute. \nNICKY You used to love life. You don't exude this any more. \n", "test2_id": 2932, "test3_input": "RIVER You have to eat at the wheel. You cannot get anywhere. \nNICKY That's the drama. We're waiting for life to continue. Where do you pee, Ibrahmin? \nDRIVER Under the Manhattan Bridge. \nNICKY That's where I peed. \nEXT. THE STREET 47th Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenue. A hotel, a high school, brownstones with fire escapes. INT. MICHAEL ROGAN'S KITCHEN Michael, Nicky's father, is making an omelette on the old stove. He is pushing eighty, slow-moving, with a two-day stubble. \nKnock at the door. \nMichael goes to the intercom, inches from the door. \nMICHAEL (into speaker) Who is it? \nNICKY (V.O.) I'm at the door. \nMICHAEL (into speaker) Go way. I'll call a cop. \nNICKY (V.O.) Pop, will you let me in? \nMICHAEL (into speaker) Where the hell are you? \nNICKY (V.O.) Right here. At the door. \nMichael goes to the door and looks through the peephole. \nINTERCUT AS NECESSARY MICHAEL What do you want? \nNICKY It's me. Nicky. \nMICHAEL Nicky comes on Sunday's. \nNICKY Where are your glasses? Go get them. \nMICHAEL If it's you, what are you doing here? \nNICKY I'm on my way to get a haircut. \nICHAEL Where does Nicky get his hair cut? \nNicky stands against the door, speaking softly into the peephole. \nNICKY Across Ninth Avenue. Dodgie's. Where you've been getting your hair cut for fifty years. Where Uncle Billy and Uncle Marty got their hair cut. Where Jim Rorty shot a man for cheating at poker. \nMICHAEL It was rummy, not poker. But I'll take a chance and let you in. \nINT. MICHAEL ROGAN'S KITCHEN - LATER Michael is eating his omelette at a small enamel-topped table in the kitchen. Nicky stands by the boxlike refrigerator, drinking a beer. This is the kitchen that is the centerpiece of the theatre set. The new play is Nicky's young life. \nNICKY It's a constant shock to me, how small this place is. How did we do it? Five people in these little rooms. \nMICHAEL Get yourself something to eat. \nNicky takes some eggs out of the refrigerator. \n", "test3_true": "MICHAEL Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle. \nNICKY Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?' \nMICHAEL You know the answer to that. \nNICKY I do know the answer to that. Why don't we watch the ball game later? We'll go to Mannion's. \nMICHAEL They're only gonna lose. \nNICKY Of course they're gonna lose. We'll watch them lose. What good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand? \nMICHAEL The Red Sox are your problem. I never understood about you and the Red Sox. Everybody rooted for the Yankees. \nNicky is scrambling the eggs. \nNICKY Remember 1949? Last two games of the season. Against the Yankees. The Sox lost on Saturday. Then they lost on Sunday. First I cried for twenty-four hours. Then I had fist- fights the rest of the week. \nMICHAEL It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things. \nNICKY It's all connected, Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember. \nMICHAEL But the son is suppose to stop crying. \nNICKY I could have grown up happy. A Yankee fan. A divorce lawyer. \nNicky sees his father's glasses on a shelf above the stove. He puts them on the table. \nNICKY You'll need these. Tonight. For the play. \nMICHAEL Don't make me sit through one of your plays. \nNICKY Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think. \nMICHAEL Since when did that matter? \nNICKY Let's not start that again. \nMICHAEL My back is killing me. \nNICKY Where's your elastic brace? \nMICHAEL I can't find it. \nNICKY You're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble. \nMICHAEL I lost it. I lose everything. \nNICKY I'll go get you another one. You have to wear it. \nNicky takes a roll off the counter, makes a sandwich for his scrambled eggs, takes a bite and heads for the door. \nNICKY Be right back. Take a good look at me. \nMichael puts on his glasses. \n", "test3_id": 2933}

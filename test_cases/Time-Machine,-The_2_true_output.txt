TIME TRAVELLER It was two wars ago, I believe. Nineteen seventeen. 
WARDEN (awed) Why now I recall.  The chap who inquired about my father -- and the house that used to be across the way. (stops and stares at the Time Traveller) But no...that's impossible.  You haven't changed.  You're not a day older.  And your clothes... 
TIME TRAVELLER I'm afraid it's going to take me a little time to explain... You see... 
There is an insistent, EAR PIECING SIREN.  It lasts for three seconds. 
WARDEN The last alert...hurry! 
He grabs the Time Traveller by the arm and drags him out. 
ON THE STREET - FULL SHOT                              122 
They emerge from the store.  The Time Traveller pulls himself free. 
TIME TRAVELLER Listen to me!  It's important. 
WARDEN (points to sky) Look!  An atomic satellite zeroing in!  That's important!! 
The Warden runs, looks back over shoulder, calling. 
WARDEN Hurry!  Hide 'til the All Clear! 
He descends into the air raid shelter. 
CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                  123 
He looks puzzled. 
TIME TRAVELLER All clear? (yells) I've got to talk to you. 
The Time Traveller looks up as he hears the APPROACHING SIRENS OF AN AMBULANCE.  Alarmed, he runs across the street directly in the path of the ambulance that threads its way between the cars left in disorder on the road.  The driver spins the steering wheel and the ambulance tilts crazily in trying to avoid the Time Traveller. Suddenly there is a BLINDING FLASH.  He stops and looks startled. 
VIEW THROUGH THE STREETS - LONG SHOT - (STOCK,         124 MINIATURE, SPLIT) 
A SATELLITE travels over the city in the distance. The flash is followed by an EXPLOSION and a giant cobalt mushroom begins to rise over the horizon. 
BACK TO SCENE                                          125 
As the Time Traveller tries again to rush toward his Machine, the shockwaves reach him and throw him to the ground.  He looks back, desperately. 
THE CITY - LONG SHOT - (MINIATURE)                     126 
Through the thick cloud of smoke and dust we see the once proud city of the future in ruins.  Only a single, large structure in the f.g. remains stand- ing for a moment, then it also collapses in an instant. 
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE The labor of centuries gone in an instant. 
The ground shudders with an OMINOUS sound and sudden a great rent appears in the wide street ahead, as though the earth were being torn apart.  It zig-zags down the street and from the widening fissure clouds of smoke and steam rise. 
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE But then Mother Earth, aroused by man's violence, responded with volcanic violence or her own! 
CHASM IN THE GROUND - (STOCK)                          127 
The smoke and steam give way to a spluttering of red hot lava which swells slowly at first in a rising tide and then spilling over begins to EXPLODE into the air. 
BACK ON TIME TRAVELLER                                 128 
The Time Machine is shaken violently, but the Time Traveller manages to crawl into it. 
THE THAMES - LONG SHOT - (STOCK)                       129 
As the river spills over its bed and turns into another direction. 
THE STREETS - (STOCK, MINIATURE, SPLIT)                130 
With red hot lava swirling around the bases of the remaining buildings.  The lower parts of the struct- ures in the f.g. dissolve into smoke and flame and the upper parts come tumbling down into the rising red flood.  Then the incoming rush of the river meets the flowing tide of lava.  The two opposite elements, molten rock and cold green water, dwarf the ruined city as they leap toward each other, and meet with explosive fury.  The air is rent with the SINGING HISS of water and the CRACKLING of cooling rock.  Steam whitens the sky.

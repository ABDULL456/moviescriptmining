MICROBIOLOGIST An opportunity to reduce your sentence considerably... 
ZOOLOGIST And possibly play an important role in returning the human race to the surface of the earth. 
ENGINEER We want tough minded people.  Strong mentally.  We've had some...misfortunes with "unstable" types. 
ASTROPHYSICIST For a man in your position...an opportunity. 
BOTANIST Not to volunteer could be a real mistake. 
MICROBIOLOGIST (tapping his pencil again) Definitely a mistake! 
COLE gives away nothing.  He's in a box here.  He has no choices. He stares at the tapping pencil. 
INT.  ART GALLERY - NIGHT 
A strikingly "real" world of bright colors.  Extravagant paintings adorn the walls.  A POET, tiny and ruddy faced, squints over his glasses as he reads in a booming voice to an AUDIENCE of thirty seated on folding chairs. 
POET Still among the myriad microwaves, the infra-red messages, the gigabytes of ones and zeroes, we find words, infinitesimally small, byte-sized now, tinier even than science lurking in some vague electricity where, if we listen we can hear the solitary voice of that poet telling us, "We are no other than a moving row Of Magic shadow-shapes that come and go Round with the Sun-illumined Lantern hold In Midnight by the Master of the show." 
As the POET reads, we STUDY the audience, mostly YUPPIE CULTURE JUNKIES or BOHEMIANS.  Among them, a light-haired woman of twenty- eight, soberly dressed, wearing glasses.  She's KATHRYN RAILLY.  And it's her beeper that suddenly BEEPS.  BEEP!  BEEP! 
POET'S VOICE (o.s.) "The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ, Moves on:  nor all your Piety nor Wit Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line, Nor all your Tears wash out a Word of it." 
BEEP!  BEEP!  Scowling at the outrageous interruption, the POET looks up from the text just as RAILLY, tumbling, shuts off the beeper and rises, embarrassed.  As she makes her way to an exit, the glaring POET continues... 
POET "Yesterday This Day's Madness did prepare; Tomorrow's Silence, Triumph or Despair: Drink!  for you know not whence you came, nor why: Drink!  for you know not why you go, nor where." 
INT.  CORRIDOR/POLICE STATION - NIGHT 
DETECTIVE FRANKI leads RAILLY past crowded holding cells. 
FRANKI -- so they get there and they ask the guy real nice for some kind of i.d., and he gets agitated, starts screaming about viruses. Totally irrational, totally disoriented, doesn't know where he is, what day it is, alla that stuff.  All they got was his name.  They figure he's stoned out of his mind, it's some kinda psychotic episode, so they're gonna bring him... 
RAILLY He's been tested for drugs? 
FRANKI Negative for drugs.  But he took on five cops like he was dusted to the eyeballs.  No drugs.  You believe that? 
FRANKI pauses, indicating a tiny observation window of thick meshed glass in an otherwise solid door, and RAILLY looks through it. 
RAILLY'S POV THROUGH THE WINDOW:  a MAN, his back to her, in strait-jacket and prison denims, examining the wall of the padded cell with the distorted intensity of a "mental case". 
RAILLY You have him in restraints. 
FRANKI Were you listening?  We got two officers in the hospital.  Yeah, he's in restraints, plus the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill a horse.  Look at him!  Still on his feet. 
RAILLY'S POV THROUGH THE WINDOW:  the MAN in the cell turns, looks right at her.  In spite of the cuts and welts, it's clearly COLE. 
RAILLY That would explain the bruises, I guess.  The struggle. 
FRANKI You want to go in?  Examine him? 
RAILLY Yes, please.  You said he gave a name... 
FRANKI (unlocking the door) James Cole.  That's everything we got.  None of the James Coles on the computer match him. No license, no prints, no warrants.  Nothing. You want me to go in with you? 
RAILLY (entering) No, thank you. 
FRANKI I'll be right here...just in case. 
INT.  ISOLATION CELL 
COLE stares at RAILLY.  The environment is intensely real...vivid colors...each sound, however slight, very distinct, almost loud... and yet she appears to him almost like a vision. 
RAILLY Mr. Cole?  My name is Doctor Railly. I'm a psychiatrist.  I work for the County -- I don't work for the police. My only concern is your well being -- do you understand that? 
COLE I need to go now. 
RAILLY I'm going to be completely honest.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I can't make the police let you go...but I do want to help you.  And I want you to trust me.  Can you do that, James?  May I call you "James"? 
COLE "James"!  Nobody ever calls me that. 
RAILLY (frowns, studies him) Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace? 
COLE No, not possible.  Listen, I have to get out of here.  I'm supposed to be getting information. 
RAILLY What kind of information? 
COLE It won't help you.  You can't do anything about it.  You can't change anything. 
RAILLY Change what? 
COLE I need to go. 
RAILLY Do you know why you're here, James. 
COLE Because I'm a good observer.  Because I have a tough mind. 
RAILLY I see.  You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers? 
COLE They wanted identification.  I don't have any identification.  I wasn't trying to hurt them. 
RAILLY You don't have a driver's license, James?  Or a Social Security card? 
COLE No. RAILLY Why not?  Most people have some ID.

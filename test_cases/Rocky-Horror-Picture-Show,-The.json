He puts on his reading glasses. \nNARRATOR It seemed a fairly ordinary night when Brad Majors and his fiancee Janet Weiss (two young ordinary healthy kids) left Denton that late November evening to visit Dr Everett Scott, ex. tutor and now friend of both of them.  It's true there were dark storm clouds, heavy, black and pendulous, toward which they were driving.  It's true also that the spare tyre they were carrying was badly in need of some air.  But they being normal kids and on a night out, well they were not going to let a storm spoil the events of their evening. \nOn a night out. \nHe closes the book marking the place. \nThunder is heard distantly on the sound track. \nNARRATOR It was a night out they were going to remember for a very long time. \nLighting cracks on the sound track. \nWIPE TO \n19\tEXT.\tNIGHT \nA windscreen wiper working under strain.  Torrential rain on the windscreen.  BRAD concentrating on visibility.  JANET eating chocolates and listening to the car radio playing an Orson Welles serial - The Shadow. \nA motorcycle roars past them. \nJANET Gosh.  That's the third motorcyclist that's passed us.  They certainly take their lives in their hands.  What with the weather and all. \nBRAD Yes, Janet.  Life's pretty cheap to that type. \nJANET takes another stick of gum. \nOffers BRAD some.  He declines. \nThe car slows to a halt. \nJANET What's the matter Brad, darling? \nHeadlights on sign reading: \"DEAD END\". \nBRAD I think we took the wrong fork a few miles back. \nJANET Oh dear!

It's one of the master's affairs. \nJANET Oh, lucky him. \nMAGENTA He's lucky. \nBRAD and JANET look at MAGENTA, surprised by her voice. \nMAGENTA You're lucky, I'm lucky, we're all lucky. \n40\tSONG:\t\t\"THE TIME WARP\" \nBRAD and JANET are rather unnerved by this outburst from the domestic.

At the furthest end is a throne-like chair and, surrounding it, a theatre proscenium.  In the body of the room are GUESTS.  They are the people BRAD and JANET passed on the road.  They are the Transylvanian Secret Agents - assembled on this special occasion from all over the earth.  It is the Annual Transylvanian Convention - announced by an official banner suspended over the Ballroom.  They are all dressed in strange but elegant evening wear.  They are a distorted version of the GUESTS from the Denton wedding.  A party spirit prevails, they throw their arms out in a plea to RIFF RAFF on the balcony. \nGUESTS Let's do the Time Warp again. \nJANET falls into BRAD's arms. \nRIFF RAFF is ecstatic. \nBRAD revives JANET. \nGUESTS (repeating action) Let's do the Time Warp again. \nJANET faints again. \nCUT TO \n42\tINT.\tSTUDY\tNIGHT \nThe NARRATOR moves from his desk to the wall behind him.

Streamers fall. \nFRANK I'm just a sweet transvestite From Transexual Transylvania. \nFrom the throne he gestures towards BRAD and JANET rather slowly over the next verse. \nFRANK Why dont'cha stay for the night \nRIFF & MAGENTA \"night\" Or maybe a bite \nRIFF & MAGENTA \"bite\" I could show you my favourite obsession I've been making a man With blonde hair and a tan And he's good for relieving my tension. \nWe view from OVERHEAD as the GUESTS surround him adoringly. \nFRANK I'm just a sweet transvestite From Transexual Transylvania. \nFRANK storms down the Ballroom to the lift. \nI'm just a sweet transvestite. \nGUESTS \"Sweet Transvestite\" \nFRANK From Transexual Transylvania. \nGUESTS \"Transylvania\" \n55\tINT.\tLIFT AREA \nFRANK So come up to the Lab. \nCUT TO \n56\tCHORD:  SUBLIMINAL FLASH - LABORATORY \nCUT TO \n57\tINT.\tLIFT AREA \nFRANK (Cont) And see what's on the slab. \nCUT TO \n58\tCHORD:  SUBLIMINAL FLASH - ROCKY'S BIRTH IN THE LABORATORY \nCUT TO \n59\tINT.\tLIFT AREA \nFRANK (Cont) I see you shiver with anticipation \nCUT TO \n60\tCHORD:  SUBLIMINAL FLASH OF LOVE MAKING \nCUT TO \n61\tINT.\tLIFT AREA \nRIFF RAFF throws two GUESTS to the floor to make room for them.

A chandelier hangs above the tank. \nOn the podium in front of Frank's chambers there is a stand microphone. Near the podium are some weights.  Behind the tank is a vaulting horse. These are wrapped in sellophane - Rocky's presents. \nThe GUESTS are waiting as the lift arrives. \nFRANK, now in surgeon's outfit stands in the middle of the room.  RIFF RAFF gets out of the lift first, with a glass of champagne which he hands to FRANK. \nFRANK Magenta, Columbia, go and assist Riff Raff. \nAs he speaks her name each one steps forward out of the lift.

They'll make you feel less vulnerable. \nMAGENTA & COLUMBIA cross to the podium. \nFRANK (continues) It's not often we receive visitors here. Let alone offer them hospitality. \nBRAD (Moving towards Frank) Hospitality!  All we wanted to do was use your telephone.  A reasonable request which you have chosen to ignore. \nJANET (Hurring after Brad) Don't be ungrateful Brad. \nBRAD (Stepping closer to Frank) Ungrateful! \nThe room falls silent.

If this is so, then Brad and Janet are quite safe. However, the sudden departure of their host and his creation (into the seclusion of his sombre bridal suite) had left them feeling both apprehensive and uneasy. A feeling which grew as the other guests 'departed' and 'they' were shown to their separate rooms. \nWIPE TO \n81\tINT.\tJANET'S ROOM (RED FILTER)\tNIGHT \nJANET looks lost. \nShe sits on the end of the bed. \nCUT TO \n82\tINT.\tBRAD'S ROOM (BLUE FILTER)\tNIGHT \nBRAD looks lost. \nHe examines the TV monitor. \n83\tINT.\tLABORATORY\tNIGHT \nRIFF RAFF and MAGENTA by the monitor. \nThey switch from channel to channel. \nWe see BRAD looking at the TV monitor. \nAnd JANET sitting on the end of the bed. \nJANET lies back on the bed and switches off her bedside lamp. \nRIFF RAFF and MAGENTA smile at each other. \nCUT TO \n84\tINT.\tJANET'S ROOM (RED FILTER)\tNIGHT \nOnly a soft glow of moonlight from a barred window.

Words which kept repeating themselves again and again in Janet's thoughts.  But it was too late to go back now.  It was as if she were riding a giant tidal wave.  It would be folly to fight against it.  Her only chance would be to ride it out - adapt - and perhaps also to survive. \nWIPE TO \n94\tINT.\tLABORATORY\tNIGHT \nJANET is pacing around the tank which is covered by a cloth.

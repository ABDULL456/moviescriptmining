DAGGETT Do you even listen? Do you still come to places like this? Old Man, you have been calling me most of my goddamn life, but every time I get close, you just keep moving that far away. What's it to be? You want me to kill your henchmen? Can't you even control your own killers anymore? 
Thomas holds his face in his hands a silent moment. When it raises we see the raw hurt in the eyes as he shouts, 
DAGGETT What do you want from me! 
The only reply is dust dancing in the light and the rumble of semis on the highway. 
Standing in the back, watching Thomas with tears welling in her eyes, is Katherine. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
The road's turned to dirt and the plateau into a maze of ragged cliffs and brutally hacked canyons. 
The light is shadowy and golden now as Katherine's pickup turns off the small dirt road onto an even smaller one that winds impossibly up the side of a volcanic butte. 
Higher and higher the truck climbs on the rutted and treacherous path, till at last it crests the ridge and comes upon 
THE VILLAGE 
Perched frighteningly on the leading edge of Old Woman Butte, this is the home of the Bitter Sky Clan. The village is a small grouping of ancient adobe walled hogans first built a thousand years ago by the Anasazi. There's no electricity here, no TV antennas or frozen yogurt. Just the slow curl of cooking fires drifting up through smoke holes and the stern, deeply lined face of an old Navaho man approaching the pickup as Katherine stops. 
The old man wears jeans, a bright maroon silk shirt, and a black felt reservation hat with a turkey feather. He holds in his right hand a small leather case. 
OLD MAN I am Bartholomew Grey Horse, born to the Deer Spring Clan, born for the Slow Talking People. Today I am the yataalii for Mary Tsosie of the Bitter Sky Clan. 
The old man, Bartholomew Grey Horse, walks up to Mary and her grandmother sitting in the bed. 
GREY HORSE Ya-tah. 
GRANDMOTHER Ya-tah-hey. 
Several villagers approach and greet Mary and her grandmother, some nodding politely to Thomas and Katherine as they climb out of the cab. Nearly all of them are elderly. 
Thomas, one eye still half-shut by a bandage, walks over to the village's edge where a short stone wall, and little else, separates the adobe homes from the long, 2000 foot drop to the desert floor. He leans against it and gazes out on a view that must encompass half the world. In all directions, for tens upon tens of miles, there are only volcanic spires and crumbling buttes, all reduced from up here to short, ominous playthings. A village truly alone in the world. 
MARY This is a good place. 
She's appeared beside him. Thomas crouches down to her level and smiles. 
DAGGETT Yes? 
Mary's sight is on the view, eyeing it critically. 
MARY Separate water source. Stocked grain. Only one possible approach. A man could, with the proper defenses, hold off an entire battalion for weeks. Months. 
Thomas's voice sighs sadly as he runs a hand softly through her hair. 
DAGGETT Which one of you is that talking, Mary? Or do you even know anymore? 
Mary's eyes fill with tears as her grandmother appears and leads her back to the adobe hogans. 
Grey Horse, the yataalii, is there now. 
GREY HORSE We will start the Sing soon to remove the Yei spirit and stop the ghost sickness. 
DAGGETT This might not be the work of a Navaho ghost. 
GREY HORSE It's all the same. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
Night creeps over the Chuska Mountains across the crusty caliche flats and over the village, pushing back the dying day to a thin, fading blue line etched across the horizon. As the darkness settles on the hogans we see a glimmer of light from within and the rising, guttural chants of the yataalii. 
INT. KIVA - NIGHT 
Under the village, beneath the surface of the butte, is the large communal kiva room. Accessible by a single ladder through a single smoke hole, it is down here that the village performs its Enemy Ghost Way for Mary. 
The little girl is there, attended by her grandmother, sitting stoically still on a blanket as Grey Horse, grasping his painted prayer sticks, by the glow of a fire chants the Enemy Ghost Way cure. Katherine's eyes sting in the smokey air as she watches Grey Horse take from his case small handfulls of colored sand that he pours in fine patterns onto the floor. 
The whole Bitter Sky Clan surrounds them. Old, lined faces. A small, dying people here to support its last granddaughter.

EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT 
Katherine stands there in the chilly darkness outside the kiva. Mary's grandmother, passing with some other women, pauses and squeezes Katherine's arm. 
GRANDMOTHER Now we sleep, Katherine. Tomorrow, after dark, we begin again. 
INSIDE THE KIVA 
The fire has died to embers, casting its weak glow on a now empty room.

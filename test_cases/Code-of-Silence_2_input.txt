INT. HEADQUARTERS - DAY 
The two Comacho lookouts who survived the raid, Efren and Pompas, have been brought in for questioning. The interrogation is taking place in a small room. 
Officers Brennan and Music are here with Eddie. 
The Comachos sit silent as stones. 
MUSIC (to Efren) You know that, Efren. When your big bad brother Luis gets the word, your ass is freeze dried and fried. 
Efren stares ahead. Music looks at Eddie who is fiddling with the Rubic's Cube, to little success. 
Brennan takes Music's place. He kicks Pompas' chair hard. 
BRENNAN Talk you hemorrhoid! 
POMPAS (in Spanish) Your mother fucks dogs in the street. 
BRENNAN You wanna tune-up? Hey Sarge, you know why a Comacho's like a cue-ball? Cause the harder you hit 'em, the better their English gets. 
It's not a joke, but a threat. Pompas spits at Brennan. Brennan is enraged, but Eddie pushes him back with a hand. 
Eddie faces the Comachos. 
EDDIE We're jerking off here. 
Eddie goes out the door. 
INT. HEADQUARTERS HALL - DAY 
As Eddie emerges, he bumps into the Camacho's lawyer SANCHEZ; thirty-eight, well dressed, smooth as silk. 
Sanchez sees the tableau in the room. As Cusack walks down the hall the attorney follows him. 
SANCHEZ Let's cut the shit, Cusack. 
Eddie ignores him. 
SANCHEZ Option 1: you can send em downtown. If Judge Collins didn't get laid last night, you can probably get him to arraign my clients for loitering in their own hallway. He'll set bail. I'll take care of it. Option 2: release them here and now and we'll call it a day. (pause) Up to you. 
EDDIE I like to see you earn your money. 
Sanchez backs off. We follow Eddie down the hall. 
INT. KATES' OFFICE - DAY 
The head of Area Four, COMMANDER KATES, is grilling Cragie and Kosalas. 
CRAGIE We come up the back stairs. We start cleanin' the hallway when the deceased pops out of a doorway with a 25 automatic. I tell him to drop it, but he's comin. We had no choice. Kosalas here saw the whole thing. 
Kates turns to Kosalas. 
KATES Did you? 
Kosalas looks haggard. 
KOSALAS I was on another doorway... 
KATES But you saw the action? 
KOSALAS I saw him fall. 
KATES And the kid was armed? 
KOSALAS That's the way it went down. 
KATES And you saw the weapon?

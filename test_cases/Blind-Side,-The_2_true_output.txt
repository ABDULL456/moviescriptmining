LEIGH ANNE Come on, Michael! 
ON THE FIELD 
Wingate breaks huddle and as they get into their stances #66 calls a switch. He moves inside and the linebacker moves outside. Michael looks at the move, confused. 
Hut! Tony, the Wingate QB starts to drop back but hands off the ball on a draw to BOBBY, the Oompaloompah. Michael, unsure which player to block, just stands there while they both crush Bobby. The Milford players high five and both give Michael a shoulder as they pass him. 
NEXT PLAY - BALL SNAPS Michael hits #66 square in the numbers, putting him on his heels. But he's quick as a cat and jumps to bat down a pass. 
REFEREE Fourth down ! The crusaders offense leaves the field. #66 follows behind Michael, taunting him. 
MILFORD #66 And don't come back unless you want me to embarrass your black ass! 
COTTON Get back to your own bench, 66! 66 laughs and struts away. Cotton goes straight to the ref. 
COTTON (CONT'D) Did you hear what he said? Are you gonna just let that kinda talk go?! 
REFEREE Ever heard of the First amendment, Coach? Get back to the sideline. Cotton takes a deep breath, then turns to Michael, who has been beside him the whole time. 
COTTON Look, son, 66 is quick, so just focus on his belt buckle.

COTTON (CONT'D) Where it goes he goes. And block 'til the whistle blows. All right? Michael nods and takes a seat on the bench. Cotton hears something and realizes it is his cell phone. He looks at the number calling. and answers... 
COTTON (CONT'D) Hello?... 
IN THE STANDS Leigh Anne is on the phone. 
LEIGH ANNE Enough with the trick plays, Bert. Just run the dang ball. 
AND Bert, on the field, turns to the stands, shakes his head hangs up angrily. Behind the Tuohys, the Milford fans are in a frenzy. 
MILFORD DAD That's my boy Jimmy, number 66. He is kicking that blue gum's ass! Leigh Anne can't restrain herself. She rises, turns 
LEIGH ANNE Hey crotch mouth! Yeah, you! Zip it or I'll come zip it for ya! Sean pulls her back down to her seat. 
SI Sticks and stones?

124 CONTINUED: 124 Bert Cotton gathers his forces. 
COTTON It's all right. Settle down. 
ON THE FIELD The Crusaders have the ball at the twenty. They break from the huddle, get over the ball and the play starts. It's a sweep left and Michael pulls to lead for Bobby. 66 fends off Michael and keeps moving, forcing a pileup near the sideline. Michael and Bobby are at the bottom of the pile. 66 extricates himself from the pile and gives Michael a little kick as a cherry on top. 
MILFORD #66 Big black pile of nigger crap! Cotton is nearby, hears this, races straight over to the Ref. 
COTTON Ref, you gonna do something about this?! He kicked my boy in the head and cussed him! The Ref throws a flag. 
COTTON (CONT'D) Thank you! 
REFEREE Unsportsmanlike conduct on Wingate! Fifteen yards. Shut up or you'll get another fifteen. 
COTTON What happened to the first Amendment?! Cotton throws his hat and another ref throws a flag. 
COTTON (CONT'D) This young man plays for my team and I will defend him like he's my own son! Against you or any other redneck sonofabitch! Michael watches, dumbfounded. He walks over to the livid Cotton and pulls him backwards, looks him in the eye.

KIRK You don't know what you're talking about. 
WILLY He does not know! 
STAINER Yes, I do, Kirk! I know exactly what I'm talking about. 
WILLY Perhaps he does know after all! 
STAINER Remember last year when you hardly saw me for about two months? I met my own perfect ten. Tina Jordan. Smart, cool and hot like you wouldn't believe. Hotter than Molly even. 
KIRK Yeah right. So how come I never heard a word about her until now? 
WILLY Yes, how come no word of this Tina!? 
STAINER I didn't tell anyone. I didn't want to jinx it. She was perfect. I was spilling over with...with fucking happy! You know? 
WILLY Fucking happy! 
STAINER Two months into it, she dumps me. And I knew it was coming. A girl like that. Sooner or later she was bound to get a better offer. But it kicked my ass, man. I was depressed for months. 
KIRK That's what that was? You said you had that fatigue syndrome thing. 
STAINER I didn't want everyone knowing what a pussy I was. Dude, it was a hurt I can't even put into words. 
WILLY What a pussy. 
STAINER I couldn't watch you go through that 'cause I love you, man. You're the brother I never had. 
Stainer leans over and hugs Kirk.   Kirk doesn't hug back. 
KIRK You have a brother, Stainer. 
STAINER Yeah, but he's a cheese-dick. 
Kirk's phone rings.    He answers, forcing Stainer to let go. 
KIRK Hello? 
INT. LAW OFFICE 
Maury sits at his desk. 
MAURY Kirk? Geeze, I'm glad I caught you. Listen son, I got something to tell you and don't get mad at me okay? 'Cause this thing ain't my fault. You might want to sit down for this. 
INT. AIRPORT SHUTTLE BUS 
Kirk slumps into a seat and listens, looking upset and shocked. Stainer stares at Kirk, trying to get a sense of what Kirk is being told. 
STAINER What!? 
INT. MOLLY'S OFFICE - DAY 
Patty sits behind a reception desk in a small but stylish lobby. A sign above her desk reads, "McCall Events." Kirk walks in. Patty puts down her work and stares back at him. 
KIRK Is Molly in? 
PATTY You got some big red apples showing your face around here again. 
KIRK I know. I'm sorry.     I just...   Is she here? 
PATTY No.     Get lost. 
Stainer bursts in sweating and panting. 
PATTY (CONT'D) Oh, for Christ sake! This one too!? 
Patty comes out from behind her desk. 
PATTY (CONT'D) I'm warning you both - Molly has been through enough. You go near her and I will fuck you all the way up! Understand!? 
Stainer swaggers up into Patty's face. 
STAINER Listen, bitch... 
WHACK!!! Patty throws an elbow and Stainer's head jacks back. She is instantly on him, grabbing him in a headlock and punching him in the face.

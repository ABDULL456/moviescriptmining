SIF Or we could just start there. She points behind them to the town of Puente Antiguo in the distance -- the only visible sign of civilization -- and to Hogun, who has already started walking towards it. Volstagg and Fandral trade looks, their egos bruised. 
FANDRAL It's worth a look, I suppose. The party tromps towards the town. 
112 EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY 112 
Townsfolk stare in wonder at the Warriors Three and Sif, as they stroll down the street in all their Asgardian splendor. 
113 EXT. DOWN THE STREET - DAY 113 
A BOY Hits a baseball, which rolls under a parked car. He runs to retrieve it, but can't reach it. Suddenly, the side of the CAR rises into the air. The boy looks over, his mouth dropping open at what he sees. Volstagg easily holds the car up with one hand. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 88. Volstagg picks up the boy's ball, then drops the car. He hands the ball back to the boy, tousling his hair. 
VOLSTAGG There you go, lad! The boy just stares, standing frozen. The Asgardians head off. 
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D) Is it just me, or does Earth look a little different to you? 
SIF It has been a thousand years... 
VOLSTAGG Things change so fast here. You leave for a millennium, and it's like the whole neighborhood's gone. Volstagg sniffs, smells something. 
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D) Perhaps we should split up. 
114 EXT. PUENTE ANTIGUO - ROOFTOP - DAY 114 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 89. Agents Cale and Garrett spot Sif, Fandral, and Hogun walking down the street. 
AGENT GARRETT Is there a Renaissance Faire in town? 
AGENT CALE Call it in. But before they can, Volstagg rises up behind them, smashes their heads together. They're out. 
VOLSTAGG Never cared for spies. He starts to go, then sees their bag of fast food on the ground. Intrigued, he pulls out a cheeseburger and takes a bite. He likes what he tastes. 
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D) Exquisite. 
115 EXT. PALACE GROUNDS - DAY 115 
Loki stands with Gungnir, surveying his kingdom, when an Einherjar Guard quickly approaches him, out of breath. 
EINHERJAR GUARD My liege, the Warriors Three and the Lady Sif have gone missing. Loki reacts. He knows who's responsible. 
116 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - DAY 116 
Loki approaches Heimdall on the Rainbow Bridge. 
HEIMDALL Tell me, Loki, how did you get the Jotuns into Asgard? 
LOKI You think the Bifrost is the only way in and out of the Realm? There are secret paths between worlds to which even you with all your gifts are blind. But I have need of them no longer, now that I am King. 
(THEN) And I say, for your act of treason, you are relieved of your duties as Gatekeeper. And you are no longer a citizen of Asgard. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 90. 
HEIMDALL Then I need no longer obey you. Heimdall raises his massive sword, strides towards Loki. Loki reaches out and, with both hands, takes hold of something invisible, hovering in mid-air before him. As it quickly fades into view, we realize what it is -- 
THE CASKET OF ANCIENT WINTERS. The blueness creeps from his hands and up his arms, as Loki opens the Casket towards Heimdall, who is fast approaching. From inside the Casket, all hell breaks loose. The fury of the Casket is unleashed, its winds not just howling, but SCREAMING, as ice and snow and darkness come flying straight towards Heimdall. Ice clings to his body, freezing him, but still he moves forward. Loki starts to get worried. Heimdall is nearly upon him. The Gatekeeper swings his massive sword at the prince. But the blade STOPS, frozen, just inches from Loki's throat. Loki breathes a sigh of relief and steps past him. 
117 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 117 
Loki inserts Gungnir into the Observatory's control panel and opens the Bifrost. He gestures, and the veiled DESTROYER appears before him, a fiery glow rising within it. It turns its head toward its King. 
LOKI Ensure my brother does not return. 
118 INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - DAY 118 
Jane, Thor, Darcy, and Selvig make a charming team, tidying up after breakfast -- washing, drying, and putting plates and utensils away. The door opens. 
VOLSTAGG (O.S.) Found you! Thor, Jane, Selvig, and Darcy turn to see -- 
SIF AND THE WARRIORS THREE Staring baffled at the sight of the domestic Thor drying dishes in mortal clothing. Jane drops a plate. It goes SHATTERING on the floor. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 90A. 
THOR My friends! Thor happily races over and greets his comrades. Jane, Selvig, and Darcy watch the Asgardians from across the room. Jane looks concerned. Selvig and Darcy eye them with wonder. 
SELVIG I don't believe it... 
DARCY Who are they? 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 91. 
VOLSTAGG Lady Sif and the Warriors Three. Surely you've heard tales of Hogun the Grim, Fandral the Dashing, and I, Volstagg the Svelte? Selvig looks pointedly at Volstagg's massive gut. 
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D) Well, perhaps I've put on a little more muscle since I was here last.

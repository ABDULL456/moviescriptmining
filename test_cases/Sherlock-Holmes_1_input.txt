Irene gets up, walks behind a DRESSING SCREEN. 
IRENE (behind screen) The eye patch was a nice touch. 
HOLMES But I've never known a professor to carry a gun, and on such a clever contraption. 
IRENE (O.S.) Let's not argue. 
HOLMES We're not. 
Irene steps out, now wearing an array of Victorian undergarments. Unfairly gorgeous. The huge DIAMOND still around her neck. She moves back to the dressing table. 
Holmes won't look at her, refusing to get turned on. 
HOLMES Tell me who you're working for and what he's after. 
IRENE That's nobody's business but my own.

61A. 75   CONTINUED: (2)                                                75 HOLMES I disagree. 
IRENE You see, we are arguing. 
Holmes gets closer and closer to Irene as he presses his case vehemently. 
HOLMES When a man you ask me to find ends up dead in the coffin of the most notorious murderer since Jack the Ripper and that murderer manages to return from the dead, not only is it my business, it's the business of Scotland Yard and the highest levels of the British government. They will certainly consider your reticence to be an obstruction of justice. Which in relation to a crime of this magnitude would certainly mean prison time. 
IRENE This wine is excellent.    You should really try some. 
Holmes notices her Derringer on the table next to the wine bottle. 
HOLMES So what's it to be? 
IRENE Do we really have to decide now? 
Irene reaches for the wine. 
HOLMES You're in over your head this time, Irene. 
Irene snatches up her gun.    Holmes grabs her arm. 
BANG! A BULLET tears into his shoe, missing his toe. Holmes snatches away the smoking Derringer. Irene kisses him, hard and angry at first, becoming something else. Another of the weapons in her arsenal, and the one that disarms Holmes. 
The kiss leads them to the bed. 
(CONTINUED) 
75   CONTINUED: (3)                                                 75 IRENE That's better. 
Irene pulls him down to it.     He doesn't resist. 
CLICK! 
Holmes' eyes flare with surprise. 
CLICK! 
IRENE Much better. 
Irene has handcuffed him to the bed frame. 
IRENE This is the only way it could ever work between us, Sherlock -- one in shackles, the other with the key. 
She gets off him. 
While he struggles on the bed, Irene walks casually across the room. She starts putting on MAN'S CLOTHING. She's in charge now. 
IRENE I've NEVER been in over my head. 
HOLMES How can you live like this -- always a fugitive. 
She approaches, now dressed as a man, straddles him. 
IRENE But free. And on my own terms. Just like you -- well, not you at this exact moment -- 
(CONTINUED) 
75    CONTINUED: (4)                                               75 She pulls at the front of his trousers, throws the handcuff keys down there. 
IRENE -- but generally speaking. 
Holmes has no retort. Irene takes the scarf off his neck, moves to the doorway. 
IRENE If anyone asks, please let them know that Mr. O'Neil didn't have time to check out. (beat) I hope you don't mind settling the bill. 
OR ALT: 
IRENE What were you doing consorting with a married business traveller in his hotel room is something you'll have to explain for yourself. 
She picks up TWO SUITCASES waiting for her at the door (NEW PROP!) and, as she leaves: 
IRENE Where's Watson when you need him? 
75A                                                                75A OMITTED 
76    INT. SIR THOMAS' HOUSE - NIGHT                                76 
Sir Thomas enters the hall from outside, he looks tired. His butler, PERIGRINE, stands there waiting for him. 
PERIGRINE Good evening, sir. Some figs and honey with a nice glass of port? I've prepared a tray. 
SIR THOMAS No thank you, Perigrine, I'm going to bed. (as he heads upstairs) You won't let those figs go to waste, will you? 
(CONTINUED) 
63A. 76   CONTINUED:                                                     76 PERIGRINE Nor the port, sir.

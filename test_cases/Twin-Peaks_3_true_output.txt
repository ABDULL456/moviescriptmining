Donna looks around at all the ashtrays filled to the brim with butts. 
DONNA (looking at the cigarettes) If I had a nickel for every cigarette your mom smoked, I'd be dead. 
LAURA Gotta go, Donna.  I'll call you tomorrow. 
Laura leaves the house.  Donna trails behind. 
125.    EXT.  PALMER HOUSE - NIGHT 
Laura gets into her Mom's Roadmaster and takes off.  Donna watches her go and gets in her car and follows. 
126.    INT.  THE ROADMASTER - NIGHT 
At the first stop sign Laura takes another hit of cocaine. 
127.    EXT.  ROADHOUSE - NIGHT 
Laura parks her car and gets out.  At the entrance to the Roadhouse she meets the LOG LADY, who seems to be waiting for her.  She steps close to Laura. 
LOG LADY When this kind of fire starts.  it is very hard to put out. 
The Log Lady touches her.  Her hand is cooling on Laura's head. Laura moves in behind it.  Pushing the cool hand into her face and forehead. 
LAURA (whispers) Margaret? 
LOG LADY The tender bows of innocence burn first and the wind rises - then all goodness is in jeopardy. 
They look into each other's eyes.  The Log Lady turns and leaves. 
128.    INT.  ROADHOUSE - NIGHT 
LOTS OF BIKERS and the usual gang.  On stage a SINGER sings. 
As Laura comes in she makes eye contact with Jacques Renault who is behind the bar.  Laura sits at a table. 
Jacques nods to a COUPLE of BURLY TRUCKERS who come over to Laura with drinks.  One of them slides her a fifty with a packet of cocaine inside. 
TRUCKER Let's go around the world, babe. 
LAURA This isn't going to get you to Walla- Walla. 
They all take a drink. 
TRUCKER You do go all the way, don't you, little girl? 
LAURA Sooner or later. 
Laura reaches below the table grabbing him hard by the balls. 
LAURA You willing to go all the way?  Huh?  You wanna do it for me.  All the way for me means all the way - DEAD. 
The trucker turns a couple of shades towards white.  Donna comes in just as a beautiful song of lost love begins. 
Laura and Donna see each other -- As the truckers toss down bourbons and beer chasers, Laura gets _lost_in_the_song_and_starts_to_cry_. Donna just stares at her from the other side of the Roadhouse. 
AFTER THE SONG 
Donna stands and walks over to Laura's table.  She reaches down, picks up one of the trucker's bourbons and downs it. 
DONNA Let's boogie. 
TRUCKER (to Donna) You part of the deal? 
LAURA (answering for her) No, she isn't. 
Laura and Donna stare at each other.  For Donna's benefit, Laura turns and gives a big, juicy French kiss to one of the truckers. 
LAURA (to the trucker) What was your name again? 
TRUCKER Buck. 
LAURA Buck, that was really nice. 
Donna grabs Buck's buddy, TOMMY, and gives him the same type kiss. 
LAURA (continued) (very serious) All right, Donna.  Let's go. 
129.    EXT.  HIGHWAY 21 - NIGHT 
The car barrels down the highway.  It's a beat up Chevy Biscayne, with a hot monster engine under the hood. 
130.    INT.  CAR (BISCAYNE) - NIGHT 
Tommy drives sitting next to a case of ice cold beer.  Donna and Laura sandwich Buck in the back seat.  Donna takes a long swig of beer.  Laura hides a hit of cocaine from Donna. 
DONNA (to Laura, a little afraid) What are you doing? 
LAURA Nothing. 
Laura laughs at Donna then holds a beer up to show Donna, then turns and French kisses Buck.  Donna reaches forward to the front dash and turns the radio up full blast.  Buck and Tommy start to whoop and yodel like cowboys. 
Buck does an Indian whoop in Laura's face.  Laura freezes in horror. 
131.    FLASHBACK:  THE RED ROOM 
The Man From Another Place (The Arm) yodels. 
132.    INT.  CAR (BISCAYNE)/HIGHWAY 21 
Slowly Laura reaches over and touches Buck's face and arm.  Buck uncorks another yodel.  The fear leaves Laura. 
DONNA (to Laura) I'm goin' for it.

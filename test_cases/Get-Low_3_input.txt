FRANK Whatever you want, flowers.. 
BUSH No. 
FRANK Burial plot.. 
BUSH Got it. 
FRANK A service? 
BUSH Party. 
FRANK A what? 
BUSH A party. 
BUDDY What kind of party? 
BUSH Funeral party. Stumped for once in his life, Frank looks at Buddy. Then years of honed instincts surge back to life. 
FRANK We can do that. 
42 INT. FUNERAL HOME/OFFICE - DAY 42 
As they come back into the office.. 
BUSH And I want to be there. Frank goes behind his desk. Buddy and Bush start to sit.. 
FRANK You will be, I guarantee it. 
BUSH I want to be there now. 
BUDDY You want to be at your funeral.. party.. alive? (off Bush's nod) But.. it's not a funeral if you're not, you know, deceased.. 
FRANK Hold on now, it's a detail, we can look at it. 
BUDDY Pretty big detail. 
Frank cuts Buddy a look then smiles at Bush. 
FRANK So you'd like to have a funeral party while you're alive so you can go? 
BUSH Yes or no? 
FRANK Yes. Buddy is lost. 
FRANK Buddy, get some paper. We need to make of list of who Mr. Bush wants to invite.. As Buddy starts to get up. 
BUSH Sit down. Buddy sits right down. 
BUSH I want everybody to come who's got a story to tell about me. 
FRANK Say again. 
BUDDY That probably covers 4 counties.. Bush shoots him a look. Frank shoots him a look. Buddy thinks about how great an outdoor life would be. 
BUSH Then I want 4 counties worth of people at the party.

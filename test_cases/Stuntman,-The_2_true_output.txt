NINA (getting angry) Now stop that! ...I'm going back. 
She whirls to go.   He stops her, taking her by the shoulders. 
CAMERON ...What's wrong? 
Her concern for him has turned to anger, like a mother slapping her child for running in the street. 
NINA It's just dumb...to strut around trying to talk brave... 
His arm still restrains her. She takes hold of it, then suddenly softens with a look of slight surprise. 
NINA (CONT'D) 
Oh...you are scared...aren't you? 
CAMERON (seriously) Not really. 
NINA Yes.   You are...You're trembling. 
After a moment, he answers quietly. 
CAMERON So are you...and you're not even gonna jump. 
It's true. She is trembling and so is he -- not from fear. He slowly draws her toward him, her mouth reaching up to his. And then they are devouring each other. Abruptly, they're illuminated by a fierce blast of white light. They separate and stare, blinking in shock and confusion. 
ELI (V.O.) Okay, hit two and three. 
They are pinned in the crossbeams of two more giant arcs. Quickly she yanks him down with her out of sight behind the railing. 78   EXT.   CHURCHYARD - ELI AND CREW - NIGHT 
Eli is lounging in the bucket suspended from the crane.   Beside him Gabe adjusts one of the giant brutes. 
GABE (business as usual) I could kill this brute and fill with juniors. You'd get a halo around the tower. 
ELI (struggling to resist) Got no time...it's an establishing shot...two seconds on the screen. (giving in) ...You got six minutes. 
Gabe smiles, scurries off. Eli glances at the tower, grins, having toyed with them long enough, he yells. 
ELI Hey! While you're up there, be useful. We're lighting. Stand up and look towards the sea so you're in profile! 
79   CLOSER ANGLE ON TOWER - NIGHT 
As Nina's arm raises into view with the middle finger extended. 
NINA (V.O.) (hollering) Light this, Eli!!! 80   EXT.   CHURCHYARD - BENEATH THE TOWER - NIGHT 
The church door swings open. Nina and Cameron emerge, covering their embarrassment with bravado. Nina is prattling as though to a tour guide. 81   CLOSE ON CAMERON AND NINA 
NINA ...And those bells are so interesting. Imagine four hundred years ago by boat from Amsterdam. Thank you for the tour. It was so informative. I'm going to write my father. He's so interested in God and things like that. 
ELI'S VOICE Hiya.   Want a lift? 
Eli miraculously appears from above. He descends and rides around beside them in the bucket of the crane. 
NINA (ducking) Oh, for Christ's sake... 
ELI There once was a maiden fair, smooching a guy with red hair... 
NINA Eli, get away with that thing! 
ELI ...Could it be Raymond who's turning this dame on? ...Or his double, young Lucky Pierre? 
Unable to elude Eli in his basket, Nina turns on him in mock frustration. 
NINA It's gotten to the point where I have to look under the stopper of the bathtub when I take a shower to make sure I've got some privacy! (broadly gesturing to group) Thank you one and all and good night! 
Privately, she gives Cameron's arm an affectionate squeeze, then disappears around the corner of the building. He is left holding the beach bag, pursued by the Peter Pan in the basket. It has now dropped to ground level so Eli is looking up at Cameron. 
ELI Step right in, folks...the "Killer Crane" ride of the century. 
CAMERON Thanks, I'll walk. 
Eli's basket now moves up a few feet so he's looking down at Cameron, riding beside him while he walks. 
ELI Ah, youth. Six hours in town and caught with the leading lady. Not bad. Shouldn't be so upset. 
CAMERON Okay to be upset about what happened in the dining room? Why'd you promise to show that cop the film? He'll recognize me. 
ELI You really don't trust me, do you? Hop in. I got a present for you.

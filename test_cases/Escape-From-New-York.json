{"test1_input": "Hauk thinks he's got him this time.  Snake doesn't like that. \nHAUK That idea you had about turning the Gullfire around 180 degrees and flying off to Canada. \nHauk shakes his head.  Snake puts his jacket down and turns to the medic. \nSNAKE What did you do to me, asshole? \nHAUK My idea, Plissken.  Something we've been fooling around with.  Two microscopic capsules lodged in your arteries.  They're already starting to dissolve.  In twenty-two hours, the cores will completely dissolve. Inside the cores are that heat-sensitive charge.  Not a large explosive. About the size of a pinhead.  Just big enough to -- (he gestures) open up both your arteries.  I'd say you'd be dead in ten or fifteen seconds -- \nHauk stops talking because Snake has grabbed him by the throat. \nSNAKE TAKE THEM OUT NOW. \nMEDIC They're protected by the cores.  Fifteen minutes before the last hour is up we can neutralize the charge with X-rays. \nSnake lets go of Hauk to look at his watch.  22:57:38.  37.  36.  This is his life he's watching tick away. \nHAUK We'll burn out the charges IF you have the President. \nSNAKE What if I'm a little late? \nHAUK No more Hartford Summit.  And no more Snake Plissken. \nSNAKE When I get back I'm going to kill you. \nHAUK The Gullfire's waiting. \nEXT. RUNWAY -- NIGHT Snake pulls up in a Jeep.  He walks up to the tiny plane called the Gullfire.  Two guards stand by to make sure he just gets in the plane and does his job.  He throws his cigarette out onto the runway and closes the overhead window. \nINT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT Snake turns on his monitors. \nSNAKE I'm ready. \nHAUK 21 hours. \nSNAKE Suppose he's dead, Hauk.  If I come back without him, you'll burn these things out? \nINT. BASE --- NIGHT Hauk and Rehme exchange a glance; Hauk's been expecting this question to come up. \n", "test1_true": "INT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT Snake doesn't like the response, but figures he can't do anything about it. \nHAUK Remember, once inside you're on your own. \nSNAKE Oh, you mean I can't count on you? \nHAUK No. \nSNAKE Good. \nEXT. RUNWAY -- NIGHT A larger plane hauls the Gullfire into the air; the Gullfire is essentially a big hang glider. \nINT. BASE -- NIGHT Hauk checks Snake's life clock, \"Master Life Clock\". \nINT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT Snake's watch reads 20:17:40... 39... 38... 37... 36... 35... He starts controlling the plane.  He flips the tracer open and hits the button, testing it. \nINT. BASE -- NIGHT The master life clock shows the test confirmation. \nCOMPUTER Tracer test confirmed at 20 hours, 17 minutes, 30 seconds. \nHauk, Rehme and the Vice President nod with relief. \nEXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT Snake takes the plane in. \nINT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT Snake looks over his monitors.  He sees New York coming up. \nINT. BASE -- NIGHT Hauk waits at his microphone. \nHAUK Are you picking up the target blip? \nINT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT \nSNAKE Right on course. \nEXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT The plane aims for the World Trade Center. \nINT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT \nSNAKE It's been a while . . . \n", "test1_id": 2307, "test2_input": "SNAKE Keep your hand over it. \nGIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS It's all right if we're quiet.  They won't hear us. (reacting to the cigarette) Hey, this is a real one.  You just get in? \nSNAKE What's going on out there? \nGIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS Crazies.  It's the end of the month.  They're out of food. \nSNAKE Do you live here? \nGIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS Skulls?  You kidding?  I'm with the Turks now.  I just got caught in the street after dark and now I'm stuck here all night. \nSNAKE A plane crashed seven hours ago.  Did you see it? \nGIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS No. \nSNAKE Shit. \nGIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS You're a cop. \nSNAKE I'm an asshole. \nGIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS Hey, wait a minute.  I know who you are.  Yeah!  But I heard you were dead. \nSNAKE I am. \nGIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS Wow, Snake Plissken.  All right!  What you doing in here with a gun, Snake? \nSNAKE Looking for somebody. \nGIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS Who? \nSNAKE The President. \nGIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS Come on!  He really here? \nSNAKE Somewhere. \nGIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS When you find him, are you gonna take him out? \n", "test2_true": "GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS Take me out with you, Snake. \nSNAKE Why? \nGIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS I can think of lots of reasons why . . . \nShe makes a move to kiss him, but there's a noise.  They split up, but she gets sucked through the floor.  Snake tries to save her, but it's too late.  He gets the hell out of there. \nINT. BUILDING -- NIGHT, EXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT, EXT. ALLEYS -- NIGHT Snake runs through the building, breaks a window, and climbs up a fire escape to get to a new floor.  He breaks a window to get in, then pulls a cabinet in front of the window.  He shoots through the cabinet, causing some crazy to scream.  He busts down a door, shoots open part of a wall, busts through that, climbs out a window, and climbs down a telephone pole.  He then climbs up a wall.  On the way he drops his walkie-talkie.  He runs down an alley, and as he does, Cabbie pulls up. \nCABBIE Where you goin', buddy? \nSnake points his gun at Cabbie.  He looks behind him, then gets in the cab. \nINT. CAB -- NIGHT Snake notices a tape player which is playing the theme from \"American Bandstand.\" \nCABBIE Bad neighborhood, Snake!  You don't want to be walking from the Bowery to 42nd street at night!  I've been driving a cab here for 30 years and I'm telling you, you don't walk around here at night!  Yes, sir! They'll kill you and strip you in ten seconds flat.  Usually I'm not down around here myself, but I wanted to catch that show. \nCabbie lights a rag stuffed down the neck of a bottle which is full of gasoline. \nCABBIE This stuff is like gold around here, you know. \nEXT. CAB -- NIGHT Cabbie throws the bottle into the alley, where it explodes. \nINT. CAB -- NIGHT \nCABBIE Hey, Snake, when'd you get in?  I didn't even know they caught you. (laughs) Ohhh, Snake Plissken in my cab.  Wait'll I tell Eddie!  Hey, hang on, Snake. \nEXT. CAB -- NIGHT Cabbie makes a sharp turn. \nINT. CAB -- NIGHT \nCABBIE Hey, what were you doing back there, Snake? \nSNAKE Looking for somebody. \nCABBIE Well, why didn't you ask me?  Hell, I know everybody in this town.  Yes, sir.  I've been driving this cab for thirty years, this very same cab. \nSnake points his gun at Cabbie. \n", "test2_id": 2308, "test3_input": "DUKE I can't hear you. \nPRESIDENT YOU ARE... THE DUKE OF NEW YORK... YOU'RE A-NUMBER-ONE! \nDUKE (to Brain) Get me the diagram. \nBRAIN Duke... Don't kill Plissken.  We need him. \nThe Duke points the gun at Brain, but doesn't even give him a glance. \nDUKE Get moving, Brain. \nBrain moves, and Weirdo laughs that odd laugh.  The Duke fires at the President's briefcase.  Papers and a tape fall out.  Weirdo looks down and kicks the tape away.  He picks it up and holds it to his ear, then puts it in his pocket.  Guards come and unstrap the President.  The Duke has decided to take Snake a bit more seriously than he had. \nWhich is not saying much. \nEXT. NEW YORK -- LATE AFTERNOON Helicopters fly above ground.  A group stands with a car, gesturing wildly. \nINT. HELICOPTER -- LATE AFTERNOON \nPILOT People out below in the park.  Can you see them? \nINT. BASE -- LATE AFTERNOON \nPILOT Surveillance 2 to Security Control.  We're getting that readout, mostly in the infrared. \nHauk and Rehme immediately check out the monitor.  At least something's going on. \nPILOT We have a visual sighting on it.  It's a crowd of prisoners in Central Park.  They're waving at us.  Signaling us in the food drop area. They're waving us down. \nEXT. CENTRAL PARK -- LATE AFTERNOON The prisoners wave the helicopters down.  A group of guards lands and runs over to the station wagon.  They get the briefcase which has been sawed off the President's handcuffs. \nINT. ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON Snake is awake and surrounded by guards.  The cheers are louder. \nINT. BRAIN'S -- LATE AFTERNOON Maggie walks across the room, loading a gun.  It's one of Snake's. \nBRAIN I still can't figure out whether that son of a bitch Plissken was telling the truth or not.  God, I hate that guy. \nBrain stands in front of his maps. \n", "test3_true": "BRAIN Yeah, yeah, but how?  You gotta land the glider and take off. (he gestures at the map) You can't do it in Central Park, there's too many trees.  Port Authority's too low to the ground.  Unless it was some... (he gets it... they don't call him \"Brain\" for nothing) Someplace high up.  World Trade Center.  That's it.  There we go.  The World Trade Center.  And it's gonna be a hell of a lot easier for me to take off than it was for him to land. \nINT. BASE -- LATE AFTERNOON Hauk reads the note left in the briefcase. \nHAUK \"Amnesty for all prisoners in New York City in exchange for President. 69th Street Bridge tomorrow, 12 Noon.  No bullshit or he's dead.\" \nVICE PRESIDENT Where's the tape? \nHAUK Not here. \nHe reaches inside and removes a pair of goggles. \nREHME They're Plissken's. \nYeah, they were on the table.  He never did use them, though, and only half of them is necessary in his case anyway. \nVICE PRESIDENT So much for your man, Hauk? \nHauk hesitates.  This is the last thing he wants. \nHAUK Warm up the choppers.  We're moving in. \nEXT. BASE -- SUNSET Helicopters prepare for takeoff. \nINT. BASE -- SUNSET Hauk sits at the microphone. \nHAUK Plissken? \nThe master life clock reads 1:56:38. 37. 36, \nINT. ROOM -- SUNSET Snake slowly gets to his feet.  He's still groggy, but it's time for him to move. \nGUARD Come on, get up! \nSnake limps through a hallway and into a stadium. \nINT. STADIUM -- SUNSET Boos greet Snake as he walks in.  In the center of the room is a fighting ring.  Snake climbs in, not without effort.  A huge and extremely ugly man climbs into the ring, amid loud cheers.  Snake notices that the huge ugly dude is wearing his life clock.  In the balcony above is the Duke.  The Duke stands up and raises his arms, and everyone gets silent. \nDUKE They sent in their best man.  And when we roll down the 69th street bridge tomorrow on our way to freedom, we're gonna have their best man leading the way.  From the neck up. \n", "test3_id": 2309}

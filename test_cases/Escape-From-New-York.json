STATUE OF LIBERTY SECURITY CONTROL -- NIGHT. A Jeep pulls up outside the base.  It comes to a stop and the driver pulls out a walkie-talkie. \nDRIVER This is Gotham 4, North Bay, Station 17.  I have an escape in progress. An object in mid-bay moving toward the wall. \nTILT UP -- WALL EXT. CLOSE UP -- SIGN \"New York Maximum Security Penitentiary Manhattan Island\" \nPAN LEFT TO PRESIDENT. \nAGENT She's bolted the door. \nPRESIDENT Can't you shoot off the lock? \nAGENT No, sir, she's pressurized the cabin. \nPRESIDENT How about lifting the door off of the hinges? \nAGENT No, sir. \nEXT. CLOSE UP -- The President's wrist as he handcuffs his briefcase to it. \nPRESIDENT Get me to the pod. \nThe President and all his advisors stand up and move to the back of the plane. \nINT. POD ROOM -- NIGHT The pod opens.  An expert attaches a locating device to the President's wrist. \nEXPERT Sir, this is a locating device to trace you if you become separated from the pod.  I'm activating it now. \nSCREENS on the pod begin to light up as the President gets into the pod. He pushes a few buttons. \nPRESIDENT God save me and watch over you all. \nEXT. BASE -- NIGHT A guard watches as Air Force One descends into New York. \nINT. BASE -- NIGHT Rehme and Hauk watch a computer simulation of the plane. \nVOICE Computer simulation tracking Air Force One. \nEXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT The plane goes down. \nINT. BASE -- NIGHT EXT. CLOSE UP -- MONITORS As the plane smashes into a building, a red dot drops through the building.  It's the pod. \nO.S. MAN It's down! \nHAUK It's the escape pod. \nHAUK When you come out. \nSNAKE Before. \nHAUK I told you I wasn't a fool, Plissken. \nSNAKE Call me Snake. \nINT. WEAPONS ROOM -- NIGHT Rehme talks as we PAN ACROSS a table full of weapons.  We see two guns, a belt, grenades, several pouches full of various stuff, a flashlight, a Uzi, throwing stars, and more.  Snake surveys them with a cool expression. \nREHME Some of them have cars.  They took old junkers that were left behind and converted them to steam.  We think they may also have a gasoline source in there, and power.  Greenhouses, rigged up generators.  Some areas have streetlights. The crazies.  Live in the subways.  Complete control of the underground.  They're night raiders. \nSnake's not into this.  He'll figure it out when he gets there.  He picks up a bracelet with an eagle on it. \nHAUK Tracer.  Sends a radio signal for fifteen minutes.  You push it, we can track you on radar.  Just like Leningrad.  But they added something.  A safety catch. \nSnake pushes the safety catch.  Simple enough.  And yes, there's the button.  This is familiar.  He smiles. \nINT. HALL -- NIGHT Snake has his jacket slung over his shoulder now.  He walks down the hall to the medical room with Hauk.  Rehme has disappeared. \nSNAKE Where am I landing? \nHAUK Top of the world trade center.  Only place you can land.  They won't see it, and you can take off from a free fall.  On the roof there's a service elevator.  It's still operational.  We use it to infiltrate the prison.  There's a power box.  It'll activate the elevator down to fifty.  From there on down you walk. \nSnake shrugs on his jacket.  He knows Hauk is just trying to assert his authority, and it's not working very well. \nHAUK You can locate the President by his vital signs bracelet, on his wrist. It sends out a sig pulse.  Use this. \nHe hands Snake a homing device. \nHAUK Homing device.  Shows directions and distance. \nINT. MEDICAL ROOM -- NIGHT Snake and Hauk walk into the room.  They're met by a young medic. \nHAUK Strong antitoxin.  Stops bacteria and viral-proofs you for 24 hours. \nSnake braces himself against a table.  The medic is holding an injection-type tech gizmo. \nMEDIC Take off the jacket. \nHauk thinks he's got him this time.  Snake doesn't like that. \nHAUK That idea you had about turning the Gullfire around 180 degrees and flying off to Canada. \nHauk shakes his head.  Snake puts his jacket down and turns to the medic. \nSNAKE What did you do to me, asshole? \nHAUK My idea, Plissken.  Something we've been fooling around with.  Two microscopic capsules lodged in your arteries.  They're already starting to dissolve.  In twenty-two hours, the cores will completely dissolve. Inside the cores are that heat-sensitive charge.  Not a large explosive. About the size of a pinhead.  Just big enough to -- (he gestures) open up both your arteries.  I'd say you'd be dead in ten or fifteen seconds -- \nHauk stops talking because Snake has grabbed him by the throat. \nSNAKE TAKE THEM OUT NOW. \nMEDIC They're protected by the cores.  Fifteen minutes before the last hour is up we can neutralize the charge with X-rays. \nSnake lets go of Hauk to look at his watch.  22:57:38.  37.  36.  This is his life he's watching tick away. \nHAUK We'll burn out the charges IF you have the President. \nSNAKE What if I'm a little late? \nHAUK No more Hartford Summit.  And no more Snake Plissken. \nSNAKE When I get back I'm going to kill you. \nHAUK The Gullfire's waiting. \nEXT. RUNWAY -- NIGHT Snake pulls up in a Jeep.  He walks up to the tiny plane called the Gullfire.  Two guards stand by to make sure he just gets in the plane and does his job.  He throws his cigarette out onto the runway and closes the overhead window. \nINT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT Snake turns on his monitors. \nSNAKE I'm ready. \nHAUK 21 hours. \nSNAKE Suppose he's dead, Hauk.  If I come back without him, you'll burn these things out? \nINT. BASE --- NIGHT Hauk and Rehme exchange a glance; Hauk's been expecting this question to come up. \nThe plane is aiming right at a building. \nHAUK How's your altitude? \nSnake calmly angles the plane up. \nINT. BASE -- NIGHT \nHAUK Plissken?  Plissken?  Plissken, what are you doing? \nINT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT \nSNAKE Playing with myself.  I'm going in. \nSnake targets the World Trade Center.  He checks his instruments. \nEXT. WORLD TRADE CENTER -- NIGHT The plane comes down.  It hits hard.  Snake puts on the brakes, adds a grappling hook, and finally comes to a stop right at the edge. \nINT. BASE -- NIGHT \nHAUK Plissken?  Plissken? \nEXT. WORLD TRADE CENTER -- NIGHT Snake walks over to the elevator.  He uses the power box to get the elevator started.  He looks around, and the doors open.  He gets in the elevator.  The doors close. \nINT. BASE -- NIGHT Snake's voice comes through the radio. \nSNAKE I'm inside the World Trade Center on the 50th floor.  Just like Leningrad, Hauk. \nHAUK Is the glider intact? \nINT. WORLD TRADE CENTER -- NIGHT Snake stands with his walkie-talkie in the middle of the graffiti- covered building. \nSNAKE Yeah, but taking off is for shit.  I'll work it out. \nHAUK You'll have to use the east stairwell.  It'll take you a little while to get to ground level. \nSnake checks his life clock.  19:22:44. 43. 42. \nHAUK Call me when you get outside. \nCABBIE Hey!  You don't want to walk around down there, Snake! \nINT. BASEMENT -- NIGHT The signal from the tracer keeps getting closer and closer.  Snake walks past a gang beating up and stripping a semi-conscious girl.  He doesn't take much notice.  He keeps going.  He sees a BUM sitting by a fire. \nBUM Hi, Chief.  Nice night.  Nice boots.  Niiiiice boots.  Hey. \nA guy tries to sneak up behind Snake.  Snake knocks him out and points his gun at the bum. \nBUM Easy now, chief.  I'm walking.  I'm walking. \nThe bum walks away.  Snake keeps going.  A man beats up another man at a sink.  The beatee is wearing the President's life tracer.  Snake kicks the beater and knocks him out. \nSNAKE Mr. President . . . \nThe man wearing the life tracer looks up and smiles.  He's a DRUNK. \nDRUNK I'm the President?  Sure, I'm the President.  If I knew where I got this thing -- (indicates the tracer) I'd be the President. \nSNAKE Where did you get it? \nDRUNK I woke up, and there it was, just like a miracle . . . \nSnake slams the tracer against the sink. \nINT. BASE -- NIGHT The President's life signs all fail. \nOFFICIAL Oh my god . . . \nMEDIC It . . . It may be just an impact on the mechanism itself . . . \nINT. BASEMENT -- NIGHT Snake pulls up his walkie-talkie. \nSNAKE Hauk?! \nINT. BASE -- NIGHT \nHAUK I'm right here, Plissken. \nSNAKE I don't know who you assholes are looking at, but it's NOT the President. \nSNAKE Keep your hand over it. \nGIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS It's all right if we're quiet.  They won't hear us. (reacting to the cigarette) Hey, this is a real one.  You just get in? \nSNAKE What's going on out there? \nGIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS Crazies.  It's the end of the month.  They're out of food. \nSNAKE Do you live here? \nGIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS Skulls?  You kidding?  I'm with the Turks now.  I just got caught in the street after dark and now I'm stuck here all night. \nSNAKE A plane crashed seven hours ago.  Did you see it? \nGIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS No. \nSNAKE Shit. \nGIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS You're a cop. \nSNAKE I'm an asshole. \nGIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS Hey, wait a minute.  I know who you are.  Yeah!  But I heard you were dead. \nSNAKE I am. \nGIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS Wow, Snake Plissken.  All right!  What you doing in here with a gun, Snake? \nSNAKE Looking for somebody. \nGIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS Who? \nSNAKE The President. \nGIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS Come on!  He really here? \nSNAKE Somewhere. \nGIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS When you find him, are you gonna take him out? \nSNAKE I'm GONNA ask you.  Now where's the President? \nCABBIE The Duke's got him!  Everyone knows the Duke's got him!  You don't have to put a gun to my head.  I'll tell you! \nSNAKE Who's the Duke? \nCABBIE The DUKE!  The Duke of New York!  A-Number-1!  The big man, that's who! \nSNAKE I want to meet this Duke. \nCABBIE You can't meet the Duke, are you crazy?  Nobody wants to meet the Duke! You meet him once and then you're dead! \nSnake points the gun more insistently.  Tough. \nEXT. BRAIN'S BUILDING -- NIGHT Cabbie parks the cab and he and Snake walk up to Brain's building. \nCABBIE I hate to leave her on the street.  Usually I don't leave her alone at all.  But you're a special case, Snake. \nHe and Snake walk up to the door.  Cabbie knocks on the door with his shoe. \nCABBIE It's OK, Snake.  It's a better neighborhood.  You can relax. \nRelax?  Snake checks his life clock.  17:40:46. 45. 44.  Relax, my ass. \nSNAKE Thanks. \nCABBIE Boy, they got a great place here.  Like a fortress! \nSNAKE They? \nFrom the inside, someone answers. \nMAGGIE Who is it? \nCABBIE It's me! \nMAGGIE Who's me? \nCABBIE Cabbie! \nBRAIN Snake? \nMAGGIE \"Harold\"? \nSNAKE Where you been, Harold?  It's been a long time. \nMAGGIE You never told me you knew Snake Plissken, Brain. \nCABBIE Isn't that great?  Hey, Brain, I could use some gas if you can spare some . . . \nNo one pays attention.  Snake advances on Brain.  Brain sits down. \nSNAKE I'm glad you remember me.  Yeah.  A man should remember his past. Kansas City, four years ago.  You ran out on me.  You left me sitting there. \nBRAIN You were late. \nSNAKE We were buddies, Harold.  You, me, and Fresno Bob.  You know what they did to Bob? \nHis face changes.  He suddenly kicks Brain's chair into the wall and points his gun. \nMaggie draws a knife and starts advancing on Snake. \nSNAKE You want to see him sprayed all over that map, baby? (to Brain) Where's the President?! \nBRAIN Swear to god, Snake, I don't know -- \nSNAKE Don't fuck with me! \nBRAIN Why do you want to know? \nSNAKE I want him. \nBRAIN Working for the man now, huh? \nSNAKE Then I'll just beat it out of your squeeze -- \nBRAIN Mm-hm.  Maggie doesn't know EXACTLY where he is and unless you know EXACTLY PRECISELY where he is you'll never find him. \nSnake takes his gun away.  He contemplates Brain. \nBRAIN Just one thing right now.  Don't call me \"Harold.\" \nEXT. BUILDING -- NIGHT Snake, Maggie, Cabbie and Brain all walk out. \nSNAKE So you work for this Duke, huh? \nBRAIN Yeah.  Make gas for him.  Figure out things for him. \nSNAKE Like what? \nBRAIN (showing off) Like how to get across the 69th street bridge -- it's mined, but I know where they're planted. \nMAGGIE We got a diagram from a guy that got all the way across . . . before they shot the poor bastard. \nBRAIN We got a crew up there now clearing the way across the first barricade. \nCABBIE What a sight, Snake!  The whole camp rolling right across the bridge and the President right out front!  Oh, that would have been so fine . . . \nMAGGIE (ironically) Yeah, it would have been . . . \nCABBIE Yeah, but we're going with Snake now. \nThe three of them cross into the street.  Cabbie panics. \nCABBIE That's the Duke!  I know the sound of his engines.  Don't cross the Duke -- everybody knows that. \nWe get one glimpse of the Duke's car.  Then we realize that Cabbie is gone and his cab is racing away. \nMAGGIE Cabbie, you slime! \nThe Duke's car heads right for us. \nMAGGIE No, Brain! \nThe two of them run off.  After a while, Snake follows.  The three of them hide.  The Duke's car is an old Chrysler with chandeliers suspended over the headlights.  It's in a caravan of three, leading the way.  A fourth car comes up later.  The Duke is sitting in the passenger seat of a car with Weirdo in the back.  The Duke gets out of the car, Weirdo at his side.  The Duke is wearing a cowboy hat, sunglasses, a snazzy jacket, bluejeans, and boots.  He looks TOUGH.  He sends Weirdo to knock on the door. \nMAGGIE He's looking for you, Brain. \nSNAKE What does he want? \nSnake looks around.  The Duke's caravan passes.  There are more cars than there were before. \nBRAIN It's all right.  He's got to go in the front way.  It'll take him five minutes.  If you're not back to the car in four minutes you're on your own. \nSNAKE When we get there, Harold, you just keep talking. \nThey drive off.  Snake gets to the trains.  No one notices.  Maggie and Brain get out of the car and Snake ducks into the train car. \nBRAIN Hi, guys.  Hi . . . how's it going?  Cooled off a little, huh? \nHEAD DUDE What do you want, Brain? \nBRAIN Duke told us to wait inside.  He's on his way here now. \nHEAD DUDE He didn't say nothing to us about it. \nBRAIN Well, you can't expect him to tell everybody in the joint, now can you? That's why he's the Duke. \nThe camera angles back to show Snake walking on top of the railroad cars.  He hasn't found the President yet. But he doesn't have time to wonder if Brain double-crossed him. \nHEAD DUDE Why don't we wait outside here for him? \nBRAIN Why don't we wait inside for him? \nHEAD DUDE 'Cause I got orders, that's why. \nBRAIN What are your specific orders, by the way? \nHEAD DUDE Specific orders, Brain, was for me not to let no one go inside. \nBRAIN How's the President holding up, by the way?  Any political discussion you've had with him? \nINT. PRESIDENT'S TRAIN CAR -- NIGHT Two guards sit with the President, talking.  The first guard is by the President.  The second is looking out the window. \nSECOND GUARD That Brain is a real pain in the ass.  He's always sniffing around like a dog. \nFIRST GUARD He comes up with the gas. \nThe second guard looks out the window.  Snake grabs him by the neck, and breaks it.  The first guard doesn't notice, but the President does, and that tips off the guard. \nDUKE I said who are you? \nBRAIN Snake Plissken, Duke.  The Man sent him in here.  Something's going down . . . we need him. \nDuke recognizes the name.  He is impressed.  He lets go of the arrow. Snake hates him more than ever. \nDUKE Snaaaaaake Plissken.  I've heard of you. \nHe raises a crowbar over his head and smacks Snake with it, knocking him out. \nDUKE I heard you were dead. \nEXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT A helicopter flies over the city. \nINT. HELICOPTER -- NIGHT The pilot looks at a grid-view of New York. \nSURVEILLANCE 4 This is surveillance 4 to security control.  Nothing on the infrared body scan.  Nothing in the searchlight.

BASE -- NIGHT Hauk, Rehme and the Vice President wait. \nSURVEILLANCE 5 Surveillance 5 . . . security control . . . negative on infrared body scan . . . no movement in the searchlight . . . nothing strange going on down there. \nThey look at the Master Life Clock.  12:27:39.  38. Where's Plissken? \nINT. ROOM -- DAY Plissken lies unconscious on a bed, crossbow pointed at his head.  Three guards are at the ready. \nINT. BASE -- DAY \nVICE PRESIDENT We've got to go in now. \nHAUK We hold. \nVICE PRESIDENT You're countermanding my orders, Hauk. \nHAUK This is my prison, I'll give the orders. \nVICE PRESIDENT I override all that! \nHAUK Just try. \nThe crowd cheers. \nDUKE On the hood of my car! \nMore cheers. \nDUKE Let's do it! \nUgly and Snake take bats.  They circle each other.  Ugly strikes at Snake.  Snake ricochets off the ring.  He rolls around, fighting for his life. \nINT. BUILDING -- SUNSET Brain and Maggie walk around.  They knock on a door and Weirdo answers. He's wearing Cabbie's hat. \nWEIRDO Hello. \nBRAIN Where'd you get the hat? \nWEIRDO Got it from Cabbie. \nBRAIN Yeah? \nWEIRDO Traded him. \nBRAIN For what? \nWEIRDO What are you so nervous about? \nBRAIN I'm here to see the President. \nWEIRDO Who says? \nBRAIN The Duke. \nWEIRDO No he doesn't. \nBRAIN Well... I'll have to tell him you said that. \nWeirdo doesn't really believe it.  If it's not true, so what? \nBut if it IS true, the Duke will have him tortured to death. \nREHME Hauk!! \nINT. TOURNAMENT -- EVENING Snake limps around, getting his stuff back together.  He looks at his life clock.  1:34:54.  53.  He doesn't have much time. \nThe guy in the cowboy hat runs up to the Duke and yells for attention. Duke immediately gets up and leaves, as do his hangers-on. \nGUY IN COWBOY HAT LISTEN!!!  LISTEN!!!  LISTEN!!! \nThe crowd shuts up. \nGUY IN COWBOY HAT THE PRESIDENT'S GONE!  BRAIN TOOK HIM! \nThe crowd rushes out.  Snake limps out of the ring and runs off as fast as he can. \nEXT. BASE -- EVENING Rehme catches up to Hauk at the last second.  Hauk has been stalling. \nREHME (shouting over noise) Hauk!  Plissken's tracer! \nHauk runs up to the head helicopter pilot. \nHAUK Get on the radio!  Keep them down!  Nobody move! \nINT. BASE -- EVENING Two monitors show Snake's tracer. \nREHME He's approaching the World Trade Center. \nHAUK I knew that son of a bitch was alive. \nREHME He's inside. \nINT. WORLD TRADE CENTER -- EVENING Snake limps around.  He notices a cab.  Fifty flights of stairs with his leg shot to hell.  He hesitates only for a second, then starts up. \nINT. BASE -- EVENING The Vice President, Hauk and Rehme all stand, staring at the monitors. \nVICE PRESIDENT It's gone. \nHAUK The signal only lasts for 15 minutes.  Download the choppers.  We're in a standby situation. \nRehme runs off. \nBRAIN I do. \nSnake shoots him a look.  Bullshit, his eyes say, but maybe Brain is telling the truth.  Maybe. \nBRAIN Swear to god, Snake, I know where it is.  Just take us to the car and I'll take you right to it. \nSNAKE Shit... \nHe tosses the diagram of the bridge to Brain.  They go down the stairs. Snake's in bad shape, but it's everyone else who's complaining. \nMAGGIE Don't talk.  Breathe. \nPRESIDENT Come on, come on, we're wasting time! \nSnake gets into the car.  It won't start. \nBRAIN What's wrong? \nSNAKE Dead, Harold. \nBRAIN What?! \nSnake hands the keys to Brain. \nSNAKE Here, take these. \nSnake looks under the hood.  There's a man with a crossbow pointed straight at him.  Shit.  They've been caught.  Again. \nDUKE Car trouble? \nSnake looks over the hood.  There's the Duke.  With a dozen guards. Brain steps out. \nBRAIN Hi, Duke. \nDUKE This whole deal of yours is over, Snake.  You and Brain just say good- bye to each other. \nThe Duke turns away and loses aim of his gun for a moment.  At that moment, Snake pulls a gun and fires at the steam vent.  At the same time, Maggie slams the hood shut on the guard with the crossbow.  Steam flies everywhere, enough for cover.  The four of them run for it.  The Duke runs after them. \nEXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT A cab pulls up.  Its radio is playing \"American Bandstand\".  Guess who's driving?  You got it! \nSnake pops it into the deck.  It begins spewing out information.  It's the right one.  He slips it into his pocket. \nPRESIDENT Here, give me that tape! \nHA!  No way! \nSNAKE Not just yet. \nSnake checks his life clock.  23:20. 19. 18. 17.  Didn't that guy say 15 minutes before the last hour was up?  But Hauk said they'd been playing with this, so the 15 minutes was built in already.  Still, 23 minutes. That's cutting it pretty fucking close. \nEXT. CAB -- NIGHT Snake races as fast as the cab can go. \nINT. CAB -- NIGHT Snake checks to make sure they're not being followed too closely. They're not.  The Duke is behind, but he's FAR behind. \nCABBIE Easy... easy! \nBRAIN Go for it, Snake! \nEXT. 69TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT Snake jumps the car over the first obstacle.  Cabbie looks like he's having a heart attack. \nSnake swerves on Brain's direction.  So far so good.  A mine goes off, but it's behind them. \nThe Duke goes forward.  He's going by the seat of his pants.  But he knows the general direction of how Snake went.  A mine goes off behind him, too. \nINT. CAB -- NIGHT Brain reads the map.  Cabbie continues to freak out. \nCABBIE You've got to slow down a little, Snake... \nBRAIN I think there are three mines ahead, Snake. \nMAGGIE You think?! \nEXT. 69TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT The Duke continues in pursuit. \nINT. CAB -- NIGHT \nBRAIN Stay left, stay left, stay left, and then jog right when I tell you. \nCABBIE You're pushing her too hard, Snake. \nEXT. 69TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT The President and Snake run on. \nEXT. WALL -- NIGHT A jeep pulls up.  Rehme's voice comes up over the loudspeaker.  The guards on the jeep ready the winch. \nREHME This is Rehme, Security Control.  We are in a standby situation. Repeat.  We are in a standby situation.  All helicopters, down.  Wall guard, do not fire on prisoners.  Repeat, do not fire on prisoners.  All vehicles, stand by.  Repeat, stand by. \nEXT. 69TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT Snake and the President are close enough to the wall to hear all this. \nEXT. WALL -- NIGHT The wall guards grab the rope and prepare to lower it for the President and Snake. \nEXT. 69TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT Snake pushes the President up to the wall.  The winch comes down and Snake helps the President into it first.  The President goes up and over.  Snake's life clock reads 1:32.  But he doesn't have time to watch seconds tick away because the Duke is right behind him firing at him. Snake ducks for cover.  The wall guards die.  The winch comes down again, and the Duke sees it.  He starts toward it.  Snake tackles him and beats him up, dazing him but not knocking him out.  He grabs the winch. \nEXT. WALL -- NIGHT A hand stops the winch from moving. \nEXT. 69TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT Snake comes to a stop.  He panics and starts pulling on the winch line. The Duke comes to and stands up.  But he can't get anywhere because the President has found a machine gun and is now firing away.  He is very accurate.  He nails the Duke right away but keeps firing. \nPRESIDENT (manic voice) Yeah, hey, Number One!  You're the Duke!  You're the Duke! \nThe President calms down somewhat. \nPRESIDENT You're... the Duke... You're A-Number-One. \nThe President starts the winch again.  Snake climbs up and gets over as fast as he can without injuring himself. \nEXT. WALL -- NIGHT Hauk and the medic pull up with the machine.  Hauk interrupts the medic. \nHAUK The tape, Plissken. \nSnake reaches into his pocket, grabs the tape, and hands it to Hauk.  He is furious.  As soon as Hauk has the tape, he lets the medic come back. He holds up two medal pads to Snake's neck.  They buzz, they buzz louder, and then he takes them away. \nMEDIC That's it. \nSnake continues to pant and fume.  He stares at them, then lifts his wrist to look at his life clock.  2 seconds.  One second. \nBeep. \nNothing. \nSnake lowers his wrist. \n", "test1_input": "INT. BASE -- NIGHT Plissken and the guards follow a winding stairway down to the main floor. \nVOICE Attention.

David 14, we are sending Air Rescue.  Squawk 7700, contact on 121.5. (to Hauk and Rehme) There's still no reply. (to his headset) Bayonne.  I have a mayday in restricted space. \nO.S. CONTROLLER New York, I have it. \nHauk pulls Rehme aside. \nHAUK Who is it? \nREHME I don't know. \n", "test1_true": "REHME There's no David 14 on the computer. \nHAUK Unlisted? \nREHME Unregistered code.  We telexed Washington.  Still waiting for a reply. \nCONTROLLER I think I've got him, sir. \nHauk and Rehme walk back over to the controller.  He patches a voice- over through. \nREBEL VOICE It's too late, assholes.  All your imperialist weapons and lies can't save him now.  We're going down.  We're going to crash. \nCONTROLLER David 14, acknowledge! \nCODEMAN The code's coming in, sir. \nHauk and Rehme dash over to the codeman.  He shows them a display. \"Aircraft Identified.  Code: David14.  Decode: AIR FORCE ONE.\" \n\"Air Force One\" blinks as Hauk and Rehme look at each other in shock. \nEXT. PLANE -- NIGHT The plane is flying over New York. \nINT. COCKPIT -- NIGHT The REBEL has killed the pilot and copilot and is working on her own. \nREBEL Tell this to the workers when they ask where your leader went . . . \nShe pulls out a slip of PAPER and proceeds to read. \nREBEL We, the soldiers of the national liberation front of America, in the name of the workers and all the oppressed of this imperialist country have struck a fatal blow to the racist police stick! \nINT. PLANE -- NIGHT A secret service AGENT taps on the door with his rifle as the rebel continues. \nREBEL What better revolutionary example than to let the president perish in the inhuman dungeon of his own imperialist prison? \nThe agent runs back down the plane to the President and his advisers. \nAGENT (to 2ND AGENT) Unlock the pod! \n2ND AGENT immediately runs off. \n", "test1_id": 2307, "test2_input": "REHME Tell him we have to go with your plan now. \nHauk waves him off. \nHAUK We can't wait until tomorrow.  If we have to move in and take the island, it's a last resort.  It's 8:45.  I want permission to try a rescue.  Thank you. \nINT. HAUK'S OFFICE -- NIGHT Hauk calmly arms a .45 pistol.  He looks up from his desk. \nHAUK All right. \nOVERPROTECTIVE SECURITY GUARD He's dangerous, sir. \nHAUK (with quiet confidence) I know.  I'll be OK. \nHAUK'S P.O.V. We see the silhouette of an unmistakable figure.  It's Snake Plissken all right, live and in the flesh.  The guards leave.  Snake walks into Hauk's office and sits down in the chair across from Hauk.  He raises his cuffed hands to Hauk as if to say \"Take these off me, asshole,\" but he doesn't actually say anything.  Hauk shakes his head. \nHAUK I'm not a fool, Plissken. \nSNAKE (coooooool) Call me Snake. \nHauk puts on his glasses and proceeds to read a file. \nHAUK S.D. Plissken.  American Lieutenant.  Special Forces Unit, Black Flight. Two Purple Hearts, Leningrad and Siberia.  Youngest man to be decorated by the President.  You robbed the federal reserve depository.  Life sentence, New York Maximum Security Penitentiary. I'm ready to kick your ass out of the world, War Hero. \nSnake could not care less.  He reaches forward with his still-cuffed right hand, picks up a cigarette, picks up a match with his left hand, strikes the match and takes a drag from his cigarette.  He lets out a calm breath and says: \nSNAKE Who are you? \nHAUK Hauk.  Police Commissioner. \nSNAKE Bob Hauk... \nHAUK Special Forces Unit.  Texas Thunder.  We heard of you, too, Plissken. \nSNAKE Why are we talking? \nHAUK I have a deal for you.  You'll receive full pardon for every criminal act committed in the United States. \nHauk shows Snake the pardon.  Snake's eye lights up.  This is something he wants.  He's interested now, and can't hide it. \n", "test2_true": "SNAKE (re-establishing control over the conversation) President of what? \nHAUK That's not funny, Plissken.  (beat)  You go in, find the President and bring him out in 24 hours, and you're a free man. \nWe sense amusement from Snake.  This is not the first time the government has asked him for a favor.  But he's not a soldier or a \"War Hero\" anymore.  He knows they need him more than he needs their pardon. He's holding the cards now, and he knows it. \nSNAKE Twenty-four hours, huh? \nHAUK I'm making you an offer. \nSNAKE Bullshit. \nHAUK Straight just like I said. \nSNAKE I'll think about it. \nHAUK No time.  Give me an answer. \nSnake turns away.  Hauk is pushing way too hard, and Snake is determined to be in the driver's seat. \nSNAKE Get a new president. \nHAUK We're still at war, Plissken.  We need him alive. \nSNAKE I don't give a fuck about your war... or your president. \nHAUK Is that your answer? \nSNAKE I'm thinking about it. \nHAUK Think hard. \nSnake pauses to take a draw on his cigarette.  Next question: \nSNAKE Why me? \nHAUK You flew the Gullfire over Leningrad.  You know how to get in quiet. You're all I've got. \nSNAKE I guess I go in one way or the other.  Doesn't mean shit to me.  Give me the paper. \n", "test2_id": 2308, "test3_input": "DUKE I can't hear you. \nPRESIDENT YOU ARE... THE DUKE OF NEW YORK... YOU'RE A-NUMBER-ONE! \nDUKE (to Brain) Get me the diagram. \nBRAIN Duke... Don't kill Plissken.  We need him. \nThe Duke points the gun at Brain, but doesn't even give him a glance. \nDUKE Get moving, Brain. \nBrain moves, and Weirdo laughs that odd laugh.  The Duke fires at the President's briefcase.  Papers and a tape fall out.  Weirdo looks down and kicks the tape away.  He picks it up and holds it to his ear, then puts it in his pocket.  Guards come and unstrap the President.  The Duke has decided to take Snake a bit more seriously than he had. \nWhich is not saying much. \nEXT. NEW YORK -- LATE AFTERNOON Helicopters fly above ground.  A group stands with a car, gesturing wildly. \nINT. HELICOPTER -- LATE AFTERNOON \nPILOT People out below in the park.  Can you see them? \nINT. BASE -- LATE AFTERNOON \nPILOT Surveillance 2 to Security Control.  We're getting that readout, mostly in the infrared. \nHauk and Rehme immediately check out the monitor.  At least something's going on. \nPILOT We have a visual sighting on it.  It's a crowd of prisoners in Central Park.  They're waving at us.  Signaling us in the food drop area. They're waving us down. \nEXT. CENTRAL PARK -- LATE AFTERNOON The prisoners wave the helicopters down.  A group of guards lands and runs over to the station wagon.  They get the briefcase which has been sawed off the President's handcuffs. \nINT. ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON Snake is awake and surrounded by guards.  The cheers are louder. \nINT. BRAIN'S -- LATE AFTERNOON Maggie walks across the room, loading a gun.  It's one of Snake's. \nBRAIN I still can't figure out whether that son of a bitch Plissken was telling the truth or not.  God, I hate that guy. \nBrain stands in front of his maps. \n", "test3_true": "BRAIN Yeah, yeah, but how?  You gotta land the glider and take off. (he gestures at the map) You can't do it in Central Park, there's too many trees.  Port Authority's too low to the ground.  Unless it was some... (he gets it... they don't call him \"Brain\" for nothing) Someplace high up.  World Trade Center.  That's it.  There we go.  The World Trade Center.  And it's gonna be a hell of a lot easier for me to take off than it was for him to land. \nINT. BASE -- LATE AFTERNOON Hauk reads the note left in the briefcase. \nHAUK \"Amnesty for all prisoners in New York City in exchange for President. 69th Street Bridge tomorrow, 12 Noon.  No bullshit or he's dead.\" \nVICE PRESIDENT Where's the tape? \nHAUK Not here. \nHe reaches inside and removes a pair of goggles. \nREHME They're Plissken's. \nYeah, they were on the table.  He never did use them, though, and only half of them is necessary in his case anyway. \nVICE PRESIDENT So much for your man, Hauk? \nHauk hesitates.  This is the last thing he wants. \nHAUK Warm up the choppers.  We're moving in. \nEXT. BASE -- SUNSET Helicopters prepare for takeoff. \nINT. BASE -- SUNSET Hauk sits at the microphone. \nHAUK Plissken? \nThe master life clock reads 1:56:38. 37. 36, \nINT. ROOM -- SUNSET Snake slowly gets to his feet.  He's still groggy, but it's time for him to move. \nGUARD Come on, get up! \nSnake limps through a hallway and into a stadium. \nINT. STADIUM -- SUNSET Boos greet Snake as he walks in.  In the center of the room is a fighting ring.  Snake climbs in, not without effort.  A huge and extremely ugly man climbs into the ring, amid loud cheers.  Snake notices that the huge ugly dude is wearing his life clock.  In the balcony above is the Duke.  The Duke stands up and raises his arms, and everyone gets silent. \nDUKE They sent in their best man.  And when we roll down the 69th street bridge tomorrow on our way to freedom, we're gonna have their best man leading the way.  From the neck up. \n", "test3_id": 2309}

FADE IN: 
INT. PASSENGER JET - EARLY MORNING 
Sleepy thick fatigue, the end of a red-eye flight. Most passengers still asleep, a few read, or stare blankly. In business class, A HUSBAND and WIFE, mid-30's. He's awake, reading a document. She sleeps nestled against his shoulder. He's trim, sharp, good looking in an academic way. Even in sleep, she's beautiful. Wide-mouthed and honey-haired. The plane's aspect SHIFTS, the pilot's voice comes on in German. The man lifts his window shade, peers out at the first rays of sun touching the skyline of Berlin. 
EXT. TEGEL AIRPORT, BERLIN - EARLY MORNING 
Halo of lights. Giant talons, the airplane's LANDING GEAR appears through cloud. Tires hit slick asphalt. 
INT. ARRIVALS TERMINAL, TEGEL AIRPORT - SAME

EXT. ARRIVALS TERMINAL, TEGEL AIRPORT - DAWN 
Raining. A melee of travelers and vehicles. Liz beside him, Martin wheels a baggage cart through the crush. An ATTENDANT ushers them toward a waiting cab and DRIVER... a CRASH of THUNDER -- the rain suddenly triples in strength. A DELUGE. The taxi driver hustles Martin and Liz towards his car. He shields his head with a newspaper, piling their bags into the trunk, cursing. Martin sets down his case, moves to help the driver...

LIZ Hey... You're gonna do great. You always do. 
I/E. TAXI/HOTEL IMPERIAL, BERLIN - MORNING Modern 'Deco Revival' hotel/conference center. A banner welcomes delegates to the World Biotechnology Forum. The Harris' taxi pulls up in the forecourt thick with red-eye travelers arriving for early morning check-in. Martin takes out his billfold. 
MARTIN I'll do this. You check in. Liz pecks his cheek, gets out. Martin leans forward. 
MARTIN (CONT'D) How much do we owe you? 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - SAME 
Liz presses up to the crowded desk. A busy RECEPTIONIST takes Liz's booking slip. 
LIZ The Eisenhower suite. Dr. and Mrs. Harris. 
EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT - SAME 
A BELLHOP holds a large umbrella up to the rain, loads the Harris' bags onto his cart. Shuts the trunk, the taxi pulls away. Heading for the entrance... 
BELLHOP Welcome to the Hotel Imperial. Have you stayed with us before? 
MARTIN No, this is our first visit to Berlin. We're -- -- he stops short, staring at their bags, stacked on the luggage cart. He turns, tracks the their taxi, already pulling out of the drive...

a stab of concern on Liz's face. 
LIZ What do you mean the suite may not be available? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RECEPTIONIST I have to check with the manager. Security inspections of the rooms are still being completed. 
LIZ But we confirmed two months ago. Receptionist raises an apologetic hand as she attends to a ringing phone. Liz sighs, glances back toward the entrance. Suddenly curious as she sees...

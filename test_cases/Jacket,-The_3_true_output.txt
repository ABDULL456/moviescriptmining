suit, holding an URN, letting the ASHES fly into the water... 
6) EXT. DESERT: A SANDSTORM WHIRLS round before it's replaced 
with... EXT. VERMONT: A FIELD of snow. 
EXT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, MENTAL HOSPITAL 
We see now that it was DR. LORENSON who put Starks in. Exhausted from the physical strain of getting him in there, she stares at the closed drawer, like looking at it is one way to look after Starks. 
INT. JACKIE AND JEAN'S HOUSE, VERMONT, 1992 
JEAN puts down STARKS' LETTER and walks out of the kitchen and watches JACKIE sitting absently on the couch, looking past the TV. 
JEAN kneels wordlessly beside her daughter and looks her daughter in the eye. JACKIE looks back curiously as JEAN wraps her arms around Jackie's LEGS and rests her head in her lap, holding onto her with the dearness of having narrowly missed a tragedy. 
FADE TO BLACK. 
EXT. DINER, SMALL TOWN VERMONT, 2005 
Over the sounds of CARS slushing in the snow, an IMAGE fades up slowly on the screen, until we see it's STARKS, standing in the parking lot outside the diner once more. 
This time he seems situated, and hopeful. After a slightly longer wait than the first time, JACKIE walks out -- in the same way as before except that she wears a NURSE'S UNIFORM and an unmistakable air of vitality. 
Jackie looks directly at Starks and we see the same attraction between them teeming even more than before. Even as a physically injured man in jeans and a flannel, with a BLEEDING CUT on his head and no coat in the cold, STARKS is someone we see she wants to be near. 
Then we see JACKIE as STARKS does: she looks beautiful, alive, happy and just like the woman he never wanted to leave. She approaches Starks warmly, less suspicious of the world -- and less devastated by it -- than we remember her being. 
JACKIE Hey there. [Beat] You ok? 
STARKS revels in the moment. In their reunion. 
STARKS I think so. 
JACKIE You're bleeding pretty bad there. 
STARKS touches his FOREHEAD in a panic and, seeing the BLOOD on his hands, looks up at her, terrified. Sensing this, she moves closer to calm him. 
JACKIE It's ok. It's ok. Relax. It's just a cut. We can get it fixed. 
(MORE) 
JACKIE (cont'd) But we need to get you to the hospital now. How'd you get that? 
STARKS I fell down. [Beat] But I'm alive. 
STARKS looks at her -- immensely relieved and grateful. 
JACKIE [Laughing a little] Yes, you are alive. But, listen, it's New Year's Day. You're not going to get a cab. Especially not here. And you're gonna freeze if you stand out here in the snow much longer. I'm on my way back to my shift at the hospital... 
STARKS You work there? 
JACKIE [Gesturing to her uniform] Yeah, I'm a nurse. Why don't you let me give you a ride... 
STARKS falters slightly as he walks. JACKIE helps him make it to the car, much like before... 
STARKS Thanks. 
INT. JACKIE'S CAR, 2005 
STARKS can hardly keep his eyes off her when her CELL PHONE suddenly rings. 
JACKIE Sorry, one sec. 
JACKIE answers it, smiling. 
JACKIE Hey! How are you? [Beat] Thanks. I was just thinking about you, too. 
STARKS listens nervously to her conversation and the affection in her voice. 
JACKIE Listen, I gotta go, mom, 'cause I'm late... but, thanks. Happy New Year to you, too. I'll call you later. [Beat] Ok, bye. 
JACKIE hangs up and looks at Starks -- feeling a little awkward after the call. 
JACKIE Sorry about that. It was my mom. 
STARKS smiles back warmly at her; he gets it more than she knows. 
STARKS Nothin' to worry about there. 
EXT. OVERHEAD, VERMONT HIGHWAY, 2005 
Jackie's car pulls onto the highway, alongside the other, more modern cars on the highway. 
JACKIE (O.S.) How you doin'? 
STARKS I'm doing fine. 
The happy sound of their engine on the highway continues, uninterrupted, for some seconds, before, first faintly then louder, we hear a racking, all too familiar sound: the DRAWER creaking as it's opened once more...

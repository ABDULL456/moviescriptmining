CLAIR I'm so good. 
She kisses Joe and Cal, and goes off to find her husband. 
CAL Poor Mac.  It's been a bit of a struggle. I'm sure Sally's told you. 
JOE No, what? 
CAL The movie. 
JOE Oh, she's really enjoying it.  I think. Is Mac okay? 
CAL I don't know what's going on.  I don't care to guess.  Mac's really unhappy. She isn't there, that's all.  She's no idea what she's playing, not a clue. 
JOE Who, Sally? 
CAL And, you know it isn't rocket science, this script.  She can barely get the lines out.  There was a scene last week - she sobbed, through every take.  I know crying's easy for her but it's a fucking comedy, Joe.  Something's gone.  You know, that thing that was Sally - that always surprised you.  It's gone.  I think she's scared.  And that's death. 
JOE I still think she sails above the rest. I mean not like her early films.  But those were all such great directors. 
CAL Mac's a pretty great director, Joe.  He's a woman's director.  And nothing's happening.  Course he won't fire her, because of the friendship... But it was discussed.  He had to battle his studio to get her in the first place. 
JOE What? 
CAL Hey, listen, I love her.  She's Sophia's best friend. (to Joe's stare) I never said any of this, alright.  I'll deny it on the stand... (into the silence) You guys are gonna have kids.  That is so great.  Maybe that's what this is all about.  Maybe she doesn't want to do this anymore.  You know adults don't do this for a living.  You guys are gonna have your kids, you'll be directing -- one asshole in the family is enough.  Sophia knew that intuitively.  Look at Clair. Clair's a mess. (throws an arm around him) Make sure she gets the epidural.  Forget that natural childbirth shit. Everything's going to be what it's supposed to be.  "Life is but a walking shadow.  A poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more..." And speaking of me, the role of Leo in your film? 
JOE (stares at him) Leo? 
CAL Any thoughts on casting yet? 
JOE (regards him) Leo?  It was out to Jude Law.  Jude passed. 
CAL Well, I can't make any promises, and of course I haven't read the script but I loved the novel...when are you shooting? 
JOE October-ish. 
CAL I have a small window of time. 
JOE Leo.  Leo's twenty-eight, Cal. 
CAL Scratch the two, write in a four. 
JOE Scratch the two, write in a four. 
CAL You've got a lot of fucking gall.  Thirty nine. 
JOE Five years ago, I was at the party, remember? 
Joe looks up and sees Sally standing in the sun room.  He blows her a kiss.  She kisses her finger tips and puts her hand flat against the window pane. 
INT. BEDROOM CLOSET - TIGHT CLOSE - SALLY 
She's in her wardrobe pacing back and forth a bit frantic. Trying on clothing, tossing garments to the ground.  The floor is a heap of discarded ideas.  She pulls on jeans and a t-shirt.  Very similar to what Skye is wearing.  She sits a moment on the floor.  The sounds of the party below are muted. 
SALLY (O.S.) Oh Warren, that was awful, I can't sing. 
The CAMERA stays with Sally as she gets to her feet, walks along the corridor, toward the sound of her voice. 
INT. DAILIES ROOM - NIGHT 
Mac is on the edge of the couch, elbows on knees, staring at the television screen - watching his dailies.  At some point he drops his head.  Stops watching... 
INT. MOVIE SET 
CAL'S VOICE FROM THE T.V. (O.S.) You sing like a bird. 
SALLY'S VOICE FROM THE T.V. (O.S.) A bird with dropsy.  A caged bird.  That hasn't long to live. 
CAL'S VOICE FROM THE T.V. (O.S) You seem so alive up there. 
Sally stands at the open door.  Stunned.  Watches Mac watch her.  Watches herself, with a professional, acute eye.  More critical than Mac's could ever be. 
SALLY (ON TV) I was faking it.  I've been feeling caged for sometime.  Funny, huh?

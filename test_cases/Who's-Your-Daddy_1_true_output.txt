TED My parents? What do you mean? 
ZUKERMAN I'm terrible at this. I blurt. I'm a blurter. Your parents...They ...well...they exist no further. (off Ted's confusion) Skinny-dipping. The Amazon. Piranhas. It wasn't pretty. 
TED You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot. 
ZUKERMAN Well kid, I'm speaking of...your biological parents. 
INT. NELSON LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Ted sits on the couch, bewildered. Dad beside him. Mom pours coffee in her best china.  Zukerman regards a wall of family photos as he takes a sip. 
ZUKERMAN The will reading is next Tuesday. Naturally all of Ted's expenses will be taken care of. 
Ted's parents look worried. Mom reminds Dad... 
MOM We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning. 
DAD (explaining to Zukerman) We own a small family grocery store. 
ZUKERMAN How quaint. 
TED (quietly; moping) It's spring break. I don't want to go to a will reading. 
MOM That's part of growing up, honey. 
TED What? Having spring break ruined by will readings? 
DAD You know what your mother means. 
ZUKERMAN All right, I can give you two tickets, prepaid, but you must be there. There's no other way. 
JIMMY Mom, Dad. Allow me to accompany Ted. I can assure you, I'll be the level-headed sidekick to your angst ridden teen. 
DAD I think Ted should take someone older, more responsible. 
MOM What about Charlie?  You boys could make it a little adventure. 
TED Charlie, at a will reading? What did I do to deserve this? 
Lightning strikes again.  Thunder rumbles a second later. The lights flicker. And it's PITCH BLACK. 
INT. TED'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Candles light the dark room. Rain pours hard outside. Journalism mementos all over Ted's walls. News clippings. Magazine covers. There's even a faux Pulitzer, a Christmas gift from his parents. 
Ted's Dad sits on the edge of his bed. 
DAD I remember spring break of my senior year.  Seems like a lifetime ago. 
TED Dad, please. 
DAD Grandpa was so strong back then. Working from the crack of dawn. So proud of his peaches. 
TED Remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you? 
DAD You're way ahead of me again? 
TED (proving it...) It was the year of the rhizopus rot. Grandpa almost lost the farm. You sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival. And in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow. 
DAD The lesson being? 
TED Sometimes you have to do stuff you don't want to do. It's all part of growing up. And it usually works out peachy in the end. 
DAD I'm getting so good at this. 
Dad chuckles, but Ted's still moping. 
TED You guys are my parents. 
DAD Of course we are. 
TED They didn't want me when I was born. Why should I care... 
...if they're dead.

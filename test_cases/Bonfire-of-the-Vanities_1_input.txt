RAWLIE Oh, that won't be necessary. That's what I came to... I was sent to tell you. I mean, you don't have to... I mean, you shouldn't come down. I mean, they don't want you to come down. 
SHERMAN Oh.    I see.    Well. RAWLIE Jesus,  Sherman. I'm sorry. But between  all this and the way you handled  Bernard on the Giscard deal.                     * I mean,  six hundred million...                           * SHERMAN That's final, huh?

JUDY You betrayed us, Sherman. Me. Campbell. Even yourself. On the                          * other hand, I am going to chair                          * the museum benefit thanks to you                         * and your escapades on the public                         * airways.

JUDY I suppose I can forgive   anything, but not television. I'm    leaving                       * you, Sherman. After the    party.                        * Now if you'll excuse me,   we have                       * guests.

SALLY You know I haven't been in this apartment since the McCleods had it. That was before the Kittridges. I hope I'm not being out of place. SHERMAN Not at all... uh... SALLY Sally. 
SHERMAN Anyway, thank you. SALLY No, really, anything I can do. With the apartment, is what I mean. 
SHERMAN The apartment? SALLY I find people often need to be as liquid as they can in these situations and I know I can get you seven-and-a-half right at this moment. Fabled aristocratic tycoon -- it's the celebrity appeal. Maybe eight. If we act quickly this kind of opportunity doesn't come along every day. You have to ride the wave. SHERMAN Excuse me.

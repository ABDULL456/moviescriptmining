William, Hamish, and Stephen are on their horses, looking down at the road leading into the city. Wallace hands his dagger to Stephen, and unbuckles his broadsword and gives it to Hamish. 
HAMISH Keep these. We're going too. 
WALLACE No. One of us is enough. 
Wallace hugs them, first Stephen, then Hamish. Tears roll down Hamish's cheeks. With one last look at his friends, Wallace rides away. 
EXT. LARGE ESTATE HOUSE - SUNSET 
The house looks quiet as Wallace rides toward it. 
INT. ESTATE HOUSE - DAY 
Robert the Bruce and Craig stand at the hearth, tense. 
CRAIG He won't come. 
ROBERT He will. I know he will. 
They hear the approach of a single horse. The Bruce looks out to see Wallace arriving. 
ROBERT Here. And unarmed. My God, he has a brave heart. 
OUTSIDE THE HOUSE 
Wallace dismounts and enters. 
INT. THE HOUSE 
Wallace appears at the doorway into the main room, and stops. 
Bruce faces him. The eyes of BOTH MEN meet, saying everything. Wallace steps into the room. He sees something flicker onto Bruce's face -- shame -- just as henchmen in the rafters drop a weighted net and it envelopes Wallace. 
English soldiers spring from the closets, run down the stairs, and tumble over him, ripping at his clothes, searching as if broadswords might spring from his boots. 
They bind Wallace hand and foot. He stares at Robert the Bruce, who averts his eyes. The soldiers hurry Wallace out the back, where others are bringing up horses. Robert grabs the English Captain of the soldiers. 
ROBERT He is not to be harmed. I have your king's absolute promise that he will be imprisoned only! 
The Captain looks at Bruce the way the High Priest must have looked at Judas, and leaves. 
CRAIG Now we will have peace. 
Robert the Bruce spots something on the floor that must have fallen from Wallace's clothes as they grabbed him; Bruce lifts the white handkerchief, and sees the familiar thistle embroidered on it. 
EXT. ROAD - NORTHERN ENGLAND - DAY 
A procession of heavily armed English soldiers winds its way toward London, Wallace strapped to an unsaddled horse, his head bare to the sun. Country people come out to jeer... 
PEOPLE Don't look so fearsome, does he?! 
A thrown rock careens off Wallace's check; rotten fruit slaps his shirt. His lips are so parched they bleed. 
INT. ROYAL PALACE - LONGSHANKS' BEDROOM - DAY 
Edward inspects his father, who lies semiconscious in bed, breath rattling ominously in his chest. Edward approves. 
INT. THE PALACE HALLWAY - DAY 
The Princess hurries up to her husband as he leaves the king's bedroom, and follows him down the hall to his own. 
PRINCESS Is it true? Wallace is captured? 
EDWARD Simply because he eluded your trap, do you think he is more than a man? My father is dying. Perhaps you should think of our coronation. 
PRINCESS When will his trial be? 
EDWARD Wallace's? For treason there is no trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, then executed. 
With a faint smile, he shuts his bedroom door in her face. 
INT. ROBERT THE BRUCE'S CASTLE - DAY 
The Bruce is incredulous, yelling at Craig. 
ROBERT Longshanks promised! 
CRAIG You are surprised he would lie? Balliol was murdered in a church yesterday. You are Longshanks' new designate. You will be king.

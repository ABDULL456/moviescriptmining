TALBY ... Somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits... 
DOOLITTLE I guess I miss the waves and my board most of all. 
Talby turns in his seat and addresses Doolittle directly. 
TALBY Ah, Doolittle, I do have a malfunction on this readout, but I can't seem to pinpoint exactly where it is. 
DOOLITTLE (snapped out of his daydream) Don't worry about it.  We'll find out when it goes bad. 
TALBY (chagrined) I really think I should try and locate it immediately.  Might be something important. 
DOOLITTLE I wish I had my board with me now. Even if I could only polish it once in awhile. 
EXTERIOR - SPACE 
LONG SHOT of the DARK STAR drifting through space. 
INTERIOR - KITCHEN 
Boiler, Pinback, and Doolittle are descending a ladder into the kitchen. 
BOILER I'm getting this flickering light on one of my panels. 
PINBACK What flickering light? 
BOILER The one on unit... oh, I think it's GMR twelve zero zero. 
PINBACK Oh.  What's wrong now?

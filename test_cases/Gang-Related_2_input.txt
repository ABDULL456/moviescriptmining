Rodriguez and Divinci walk down the street, hot dogs in hand, returning to their car parked curbside. 
DIVINCI He didn't have backup. You believe that?! Jesus what a dick. 
RODRIGUEZ I don't think we should criticize that particular decision of his. 
DIVINCI I don't care what the reasons are, you don't play Lone Fuckin' Ranger on a drug buy. You're just askin' for it. That's all I'm sayin'. 
RODRIGUEZ I don't trust those bastards. They're not waitin' for us. That's bullshit. They're runnin' their own investigation. I know it! 
DIVINCI Let 'em. The gun, the coke came from evidence. The car came from impound. So what's to find? 
RODRIGUEZ That's what I'm afraid of. There's nothing for them to find. We were too good. 
DIVINCI So what're you worried about? 
RODRIGUEZ Nobody is that fuckin' good. 
Divinci looks at Rodriguez, then smiles. 
DIVINCI Except us. 
CUT TO: 
STRIPPER - INT. STRIP JOINT - NIGHT 
bumping and grinding her way through her performance. We don't see her face yet. Just her body. G-string and skin tight tank top. LOUD MUSIC. MEN in the audience appreciative. The room is smoky. LIGHTS swirl over the stage. The tank top comes off. WHISTLES and CHEERS. And now we see the dancer -- it's CYNTHIA. 
INT. HALLWAY - BACK STAGE - NIGHT 
Cynthia moves down the hall in her g-string and high heels. She enters the dressing room. 
INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT 
Divinci is sitting in the only chair in the cramped little room. He's going through her purse. Cynthia stops when she sees him, then shuts the door. 
CYNTHIA I think this is breaking and entering, isn't it? 
DIVINCI I work homicide, I don't deal with that shit. 
CYNTHIA (puts on robe) Learn anything you didn't already have on file? 
DIVINCI Yeah. You surprise me sometimes. Here I think you're just a hard case and I discover you've got a heart of gold. (holds up her drivers license) You're an organ donor. That's really nice. The only problem is, they'll never use your best parts. 
CYNTHIA I'll make sure you get them. 
DIVINCI Hey, don't get me wrong. I was just surprised that we had something in common... Besides what we have in common. 
CYNTHIA Do everybody a favor, if you're gonna donate your heart, make sure it goes to science. Most people want one that beats. 
DIVINCI Cynthia... pretty name. What do the first three letters spell? 
CYNTHIA Don't get so clever. It's out of character. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CYNTHIA'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Divinci and Cynthia are lying in bed. Divinci has his arm around her, but he's staring at the ceiling. 
CYNTHIA What's so interesting up there? 
DIVINCI Nothing. 
CYNTHIA Then why's it got all your attention? 
DIVINCI I'm thinkin', that's all. 
CYNTHIA About us? 
DIVINCI No. 
CYNTHIA Good. 
Divinci looks at Cynthia. 
DIVINCI What if I was thinkin' about us? 
CYNTHIA Don't waste your time. 
DIVINCI What if I was? 
CYNTHIA Where's it gonna get us? 
DIVINCI Maybe I got plans. 
CYNTHIA I don't wanna hear 'em. Plans just make you think somethin's gonna get better. I'm fine now. I don't need to get screwed up waitin' for something good to happen. 
DIVINCI I just want you to know, love is important to me. 
CYNTHIA Me, too. 
DIVINCI But more important is loyalty. Nothing is more important than that. Not love, not anything. Because loyalty is about respect. You can talk about love all you want, but without respect it's empty. I mean the first thing that goes in a marriage is respect. And once it's gone, forget the love. So I am telling you, I am loyal to you. Like I'm loyal to my partner. We are closer than blood. And I trust him with my life. 
Cynthia didn't really expect this from Divinci. She's actually, despite herself, a little touched.

FULL SHOT - HELMUT, MEN 
Galt takes his hand away from Helmut's mouth.  Helmut doesn't utter a sound.  He knows that Galt and the men mean business and he now must do something.  He nods his head. 
HELMUT All right... all right. 
The men move back to give him room.  Frantically, he tries to think of something to do... he knows it must be great... or else his myth will explode.  He walks around in a little circle, trying, trying to think of something.  Finally he faces them.  He bows his legs and pretends he's a bow-legged man trying to walk a high wire, but he's so frightened the result is pathetic, not funny. 
PAN SHOT - PRISONERS 
The camera works across their faces, which are expressionless. 
MED. SHOT - HELMUT 
Seeing that he is getting no reaction from his "audience", Helmut tries something else. 
He pulls his shirt over his head and walks around like a headless man.  He pretends to trip over some unseen object, peers through the front of his shirt at it, and stamps on the object.  Again he tries to walk over it, and again he slips. 
MED. SHOT - HELMUT, MEN 
as Helmut starts to repeat the same routine, many of the men are openly contemptuous.  Galt wears a smirk.  Keltner, unable to watch Helmut's degradation, moves away.  Others express their disappointment, their disdain. 
MEN If he's Germany's greatest clown, God help the Fatherland.  Doork, the Great!  You got paid for that?  To go without food is bad enough, but to have to watch that! 
2ND NEW PRISONER (accusingly) You're not the clown I saw.  You lied.  You're big all right.  A big liar. 
4TH NEW PRISONER (contemptuously) And I was going to tell my kids! 
UHLMANN He's no clown.  Not even a bad one. 
HELMUT I am.  I am a clown! 
They move away from him. 
HELMUT (continuing) Give me a chance.  I just got started. 
But the men continue to walk away.  Helmut tries to do a hand stand, but his hands slip in the mud, and he lands ignominously on all fours.  When he looks up, only Adolf, Galt and Uhlmann remain. 
ADOLF (sadly) That's what we've been eating our hearts out to see! (a beat) You stink.  You really stink. 
HELMUT I... I slipped.   I can do it. 
Seeing the disbelief on their faces, Helmut becomes almost hysterical.  He is still on his knees. 
HELMUT I am a clown.   I am.  I am. 
He pounds on the ground in frustration.  Galt spits contemptuously, and the three start to leave.  Galt turns back, looks down at Helmut.  Very deliberately, he comes forward to stand at a mud puddle. 
GALT Doork the Great. 
With that he kicks a shower of mud directly into Helmut's face. 
CLOSE SHOT - HELMUT 
The mud splatters over his face.  He cries out.  His hands go to his eyes instinctively.  he kneels there, rocking back and forth in misery.  Then from o.s., we HEAR a tiny, tentative laugh -- the tiniest laugh ever heard.  Helmut looks up quickly.  He isn't sure that he heard it. 
Then it comes again, a little stronger.  He looks around quickly to see who has come back to taunt him, to ridicule him. 
LONG SHOT - PRISON YARD - HELMUT'S POV 
The yard is empty except for a few prisoners from other barracks way off on the other side. 
CLOSE SHOT - HELMUT 
He is puzzled.  Then again he hears the laugh o.s.  He turns slowly to look behind him. 
MED. SHOT - BOY - HELMUT'S POV 
On the other side of the fence stands a wide-eyed boy of about eight, who is watching Helmut timidly.  The ragged youngster laughs again, hesitantly, as if unsure what Helmut is doing is supposed to be funny, but finding it so nevertheless. 
CLOSE SHOT - HELMUT 
He looks uncertainly at the youngster.  Is the child ridiculing him, too?  He leans over the mud puddle and looks at his reflection.  He likes what he sees.  The mud on his face looks almost like a primitive clown mask.  Very deliberately Helmut scoops up more mud and puts a blob of it on the end of his nose.  He waits for the child's reaction. 
CLOSE SHOT - BOY 
His eyes are laughing, but his little lips are pressed tight together.  He has been taught not to make sounds... not even sounds of laughter.  But finally what he is looking at becomes too much for him and the laughter spills out between his lips as they form a smile.  He laughs delightedly now, satisfied that Helmut is being purposely amusing. 
TWO SHOT - HELMUT, BOY 
Helmut gets to his feet, bows slightly and stiffly to the child, and then attempts another hand stand.  This time he holds himself up for a moment and then deliberately allows himself to fall on his back in the mud. 
CLOSE SHOT - HELMUT 
As he lands, he quickly glances off towards his barracks, but from the look of disappointment on his face, we know that none of his barracks mates are watching.  When he hears more laughter from o.s., he quickly rolls on his side to look. 
MED. SHOT - CHILDREN - HELMUT'S POV 
Two more youngsters have joined the first, and all are laughing excitedly.  The first child jumps up and down, clapping his hands. 
WIDER ANGLE - FROM THE FENCE - FAVORING HELMUT 
Helmut gets up and bows, more deeply this time, a tribute to the children's vindication for his claim that he is a clown. He turns toward the direction of his barracks. 
HELMUT (screaming at top of voice) Come back, damn you, come back.  The children... they're laughing.  They're laughing.  I am a clown.  I am a clown.

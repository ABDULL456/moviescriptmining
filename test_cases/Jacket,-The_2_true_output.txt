WAITRESS [Beat] Real is overrated. 
STARKS smiles back uncertainly. 
STARKS You don't think that's crazy? 
WAITRESS Maybe. [Beat] Maybe not. 
She holds up her glass somewhat sadly. 
WAITRESS Sometimes I don't know the difference myself. And, you know something? I think I like it better that way. [Finishes her drink] You want another one? 
She goes to the KITCHEN, and STARKS clears their PLATES. 
INT. LIVING ROOM, WAITRESS' APARTMENT 
STARKS goes in the KITCHEN as she comes out with their drinks. He hears her turn on the RADIO. She lands on an OLDIES station that's playing "Girl of North Country" by Bob Dylan. 
INT. KITCHEN, WAITRESS' APARTMENT, NIGHT 
STARKS smiles a little, then realizes he remembers, and likes, the song. It's the first familiar thing for him in days. 
He walks out slowly to the living room, where the WAITRESS sits on the couch, drinking. STARKS moves closer to the radio, leaning into it, listening and forgetting, for a short while -- only as long as a piece of song -- everything else. 
BOB DYLAN If you go when the snow flakes storm When the rivers freeze and summer ends. Please see she has a coat so warm To keep her from the howlin' winds... 
STARKS listens close -- smiling a small, sad smile. Over the HARMONICA, we pull back and see two very lonely people passing time together the way people sometimes need to be able to. 
STARKS This is a great song. 
WAITRESS You remember it? 
STARKS [Nodding slowly] It's like I feel like...I know who I am. I just can't remember anything that made me this person. 
When STARKS looks at her then, he's so close to a meltdown that it takes him a moment to fight his way out of it. 
STARKS But hey, who can forget those words? The man just wants simple and good things for his woman -- that she be warm and happy. How hard can that be to remember? 
WAITRESS May be easy to remember, but not easy to get. Being warm, maybe -- but, look, you don't even have a coat and I still have to chop wood to make a fire. [Beat] And, being happy...you tell me if that's simple. 
The CHRISTMAS LIGHTS flash drowsily to their own tempo. 
WAITRESS [re: the lights] Why don't I try to get them to stop blinking? 
INT. LIVING ROOM, WAITRESS' APARTMENT, AN HOUR OR SO LATER 
She is visibly drained, after the day and the drinks. 
STARKS They told me I joined the army when I was seventeen. That's when my father died and, before that, it was apparently just me and him since I was born 'cause my mom split. 
WAITRESS So you never knew your mother? 
STARKS I guess not. But, as of now, I never knew either. 
WAITRESS I'm sorry. 
STARKS Yeah. [Beat] How about you? 
WAITRESS Never knew my father. I grew up with my mother. Actually, I grew up around my mother. She was great though. I mean, the way she was with her friends... She was this woman who had so much life in her, she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us. [Beat] She died young. 
STARKS How? 
WAITRESS She fucked herself up day after day and then, one day, she fell asleep with a burning cigarette. [Beat] I came home from work and she was gone. 
The TEARS still run after all these years. 
STARKS I'm sorry. 
WAITRESS Yeah, me too. [Softly] Every day for the last ten years. 
STARKS That when you stopped being a nurse? 
She is surprised that he gleaned the connection -- and that he'd been listening so closely. 
WAITRESS [Exhausted] Yeah, that's when I stopped being a nurse. I never thought I could stop being one, I wanted it for so long, but... you just can't do it anymore when you lose someone like that. You can't take care of other people. 
She closes her eyes and finally passes out. STARKS watches her face, lit serenely by the FIRE and the Christmas lights. It bears her grief even in sleep. 
He covers her with a BLANKET then looks around and spots the only PERSONAL EFFECTS in the room on her mantle. He walks towards them, tripping slightly on a CORD from the LIGHTS. He stumbles but regains his balance by reaching for the wall. 
As he pulls himself up, he spots what is only inches away from where his hand landed on the wall: HIS OWN DOG TAGS, given to Jackie, only a couple weeks ago, hanging from a single NAIL tacked into the wall. 
Stunned, he stares at his NAME and BIRTH DATE scored on the metal. He looks back at the WAITRESS and then to the few PICTURES on the mantle: they are of JACKIE and her mother, JEAN. STARKS runs his hand through his hair, trying to swallow the improbability, and inexplicability, of the situation. STARKS' EYES search the room for ANYTHING that could help him figure out what's happening. On the console is an OLD PAPER and some MAIL. Totally disoriented, STARKS nearly STUMBLES on his way to the PILE. 
The label on the first BILL reads "Jackie Price." On the second, the same. And the third...until at the bottom of the pile, STARKS spots an OLD NEWSPAPER with the answer on its DATE: December 3, 2004. 
STARKS is absolutely stunned. STARKS looks over at JACKIE and, just then, the HARSH SOUND of the DRAWER being opened rings deafeningly in his ears and the image of her starts to DISSOLVE at this worst moment. He is being taken out of the JACKET... 
INT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE, LATE NIGHT

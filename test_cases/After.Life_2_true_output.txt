(FILTERED) Paul? What's the matter? Paul tries hard to cover his nervousness.   Forces a smile. 
PAUL Nothing. Don't worry. I just need... I just want us to have dinner tonight. 
INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME 
Despite Paul's reassurances Anna is clearly worried now. 
ANNA 
(HESITATES) 
OK. 
PAUL (O.S.) 
(FILTERED) Great. 
INT. LAW OFFICE. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME 
Paul hesitates.    Lowers his voice. 
PAUL And Anna.    Everything's going to be fine. 
ANNA (O.S.) 
(FILTERED) Promise? 
PAUL I promise. 
INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER 
Anna slips her phone back into her bag as she walks through the deserted corridor. Her high heels echo loudly in the eerie quietness. Suddenly one of the fluorescent ceiling lights behind her blows out with a loud WHUMPH. Anna starts. Turns. WHUMPH. The next light dies. Anna quickens her step. The lights go off one by one. The darkness quickly creeping up behind her. There's only one light still on as she reaches the exit. She looks up. The light flickers. But then strangely stays on. Bathing her in a cold pool of light. Anna's unsettled. She turns and frantically pushes the door. It doesn't open. She pushes hard with both hands. Nothing. It's locked. She turns back slowly. The darkness around her impenetrable. Almost viscous. She reaches out... ... her hand DISAPPEARS into the thick blackness.     Anna snatches her hand back. Stares at it. Then we hear the sound of SLOW FOOTSTEPS.    Moving deliberately towards her. 
ANNA 
(NERVOUSLY) Hello? Her voice echoes down the silent corridor.   She glimpses something move in the blackness. 
ANNA Is someone there? 
A BLACK SHAPE materializes inside the darkness. Silent. Brooding. Anna can't move. Terrified. Suddenly the corridor's flooded with a BLINDING WHITE LIGHT. Anna's dazzled. Shades her eyes with her hand.     As she tentatively pulls her hand away... ...it's only Jack.   His hand on the light switch. 
ANNA Jack! 
JACK Did I scare you Miss Bryant? Jack moves over to the door. 
ANNA It's locked. He gently pushes against the door.    The door slowly opens. 
EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER 
Anna, still shaken, walks with Jack towards the parking lot. 
ANNA Shouldn't you be home? 
JACK My mom's picking me up. 
(BEAT) It's my birthday. We're going to MacDonald's. Then on Saturday my mom's taking me to Busch Gardens. We're going to ride the Alpengeist. 
(EARNESTLY) Continually voted one of the top ten roller coaster rides in America, the Alpengeist is a breathtaking avalanche of adventure. 
ANNA (tries to keep a straight-face) I didn't know the park was open yet. 
JACK My mom's friends with the manager. They're opening it specially for me. She knows he's lying again.     Smiles sadly. 
ANNA Sounds like fun.

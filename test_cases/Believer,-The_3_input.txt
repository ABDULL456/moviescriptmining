Straightening up, Danny is stunned by a vision: 
THE OPEN ARK -- THE TORAHS 
...their silver crowns and breastplates, velvet robes. And Steroid Excess, lifting one out. Danny reacts with an instinctive horror. 
DANNY What are you doing? Put that down! ...Put it back in there. 
Steroid -- cowed by Danny -- starts to obey, but before he can... 
BILLINGS What do you care? 
DANNY I don't, but... 
BILLINGS (vaults onto the stage) Let's look at the fucking thing. 
Each CURSE makes Danny wince, but he just hovers about nervously as Billings and Steroid try to unwrap the Torah while others gather, some comically wrapping themselves in tallises. 
DANNY Put it there, on the... 
He indicates the bema, stepping back as if to deny any involvement, yet at the same time trying to monitor everything they do. 
DANNY (indicating crowns, the yod...) Just be careful with the... 
O.L. (puts a crown on his head) "If I were king of the forest...not Prince, not Duke, not Earl..." 
Danny cannot endure this desecration, but everyone else laughs, so he keeps his mouth shut. 
KYLE Open it up. 
DANNY (impulsively taking over) Here... 
He shoves his way in and, gripping the handles, unrolls the Torah. Low MURMURS at the sight of the broad columns, the mysterious calligraphy, the CRACKLING parchment. Danny himself is struck by the sudden immediacy of the sacred text. OVER this... 
VOICES Oooo... Weird... You read it from right to left.... The letters look like squashed bugs.... What kind of paper is that? 
DANNY It's not paper, it's parchment. It's made from sheepskin. And all the letters are drawn by hand. 
KYLE Neat calligraphy. 
Danny nods, then, as if against his will.... 
DANNY It's called the flame alphabet. It's supposed to be the word of God written in fire. 
BILLINGS Fire... 
DANNY The mystics tried to read the white spaces around the letters. They thought there was a whole alternative language hidden there, with secret, alternative meanings. 
KYLE Cool. 
Danny sees Drake watching him, smirks to express his disgust. 
BILLINGS How come you know all this shit? 
DANNY How come you don't know it? (pressing the advantage) How can you say you hate the Jews when you don't know anything about -- 
BILLINGS Fuck you. I hate the Jews at least as much as you do. 
DANNY No, you don't.... If you hated them, you'd study them, so you'd know why you hate them. You know what tefillin is? Tsitsis? Shotness? You know the kaddish from the kiddush? (obviously not) Eichmann? He went to Israel. He studied the Torah, the Talmud, the Mishnah, the whole bit. He hated Jews. 
CARLETON Who's Eichmann? 
DANNY Who's Eichmann?!!? 
Danny's incredulous, though it's not clear how many of the others know why Eichmann was. 
KYLE He was head of the Gestapo's Jewish sector. He deported people to the camps. 
CARLETON (reaching toward the parchment) Can we touch it? 
DANNY Yeah, but not on the letters. 
BILLINGS Why the fuck not? 
DANNY (warning finger) Just don't. 
Billings bristles at Danny's authority; Carleton says to him...

INT. ANGLE INTO BREE APARTMENT - NIGHT 
The apartment is a shambles -- furniture overturned, decorations ripped from the wall, bedding scattered and ripped. 
INT. BREE APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Klute jettisons the grocery bags, thrusts himself inside, looks quickly about, finds no one. Bree follows more slowly, whispering: 
BREE Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus. 
KLUTE Don't touch anything. 
He moves quickly to the rear of the apartment, looks at the rear window which has been broken inward in a litter of glass -- then returns to the table at the front of the apartment; his folders. Bree cracks wise, unsteadily. 
BREE You suppose he's a married fella? 
ANGLE TO TABLE; FOLDERS 
The contents of the folders have been spilled across the table and -- we ZOOM IN -- the photographs of Tom Grunemann sorted out and ripped apart, Even the COMPANY PICNIC photograph has been painstakingly torn, specifically to destroy the image of Grunemann in the front row. 
KLUTE 
He stands, looking down, taking no notice as -- 
BREE He got in my clothing! 
Then a moment later, she cries out again, more sharply: 
BREE (CONT'D) Oh. Oh. 
He turns quickly. She is holding out, at arms length, a pair of her underpants. With a disgust so extreme she can only laugh. 
BREE (CONT'D) Oh look what he did in them. 
KLUTE Drop it. 
She doesn't respond. He seizes her arm, shakes the garment back onto the floor. She starts to gag, slaps her hand over her mouth, starts for the bathroom. Klute yanks her back. 
KLUTE (CONT'D) Stay out of there. 
She twists free of his hands, backs away. The same elementary terror we've seen before. 
KLUTE (CONT'D) Listen to me: It's all right. I've been expecting something. 
BREE (full out, vengefully) My God, I thought it was over. And here I am, daddy, right back at the start. 
KLUTE Bree -- 
BREE Right back at the start, right? 
KLUTE Go down in my room. 
BREE You said it was over, right? You said not to worry any more, all over, right? 
She's broken for the door; it's questionable that she's even heard him. He hasn't time to pursue -- shouts again -- 
KLUTE Go down in my room and wait. 
Then he turns back into the apartment. 
INT. BREE'S APARTMENT - DAY 
A DOWNSHOT TO UNDERPANTS (as if from Klute's POV, connecting directly to the previous shot) -- then a FLASHBULB goes off and a hand and pair of tongs enter frame and flip the garment into a collecting box and we widen to reveal that it's now daylight and the scene has been invaded by POLICE TECHNICIANS. One is a photographer; another, a fingerprint man, is spraying surfaces with a can of fixative. In the foreground Klute and Trask are talking with Ross, the FBI man. Ross is looking through a dossier on Cable that Klute has compiled. Over the following conversation we show CLOSEUPS of material in the dossier. It contains photographs of Cable and his life from childhood to the present - including pictures of him with his mother and father - she a very dominant looking lady and he a very passive looking man; also graduation pictures and pictures with his former wife taken when he was still a very young man. They are the personal images of a life time. 
ROSS (to Klute) But if Cable killed Grunemann why would he get you hired to look for Grunemann? 
KLUTE Because he knew I couldn't leave the case alone. And this way at least he'd keep track of it. And me. 
ROSS What about Grunemann's letters to the girl, everything like that? 
TRASK Cable's letters, Cable's phone calls. Cable's everything else. He's been a Dumper a long time. He just passed off his own peculiar habits on the other man -- it kept things goin'.

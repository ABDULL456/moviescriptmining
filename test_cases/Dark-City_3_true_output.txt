SCHREBER Put them on. 
White and the inspector look at each other, incredulous. 
OUTSIDE  -  THE CORRIDOR 
The door opens.  White, Bumstead and Schreber step out, wearing poorly fitting masks and coats  -  DISGUISED AS MYSTERY MEN. 
FURTHER ALONG THE CORRIDOR 
The three men come across a small area with a raised platform, between arches.  A number of OPEN CARTS roll past on tracks  - the scene resembles some bizarre amusement-park ride.  The carts are numbered on the side  -  all of them empty. 
SCHREBER Get in.  Hurry. 
White, Bumstead and Schreber hop aboard.  The cart takes them into a DARK TUNNEL, deeper into the secret underworld of the MYSTERY MEN.  They MOVE THROUGH a subterranean landscape of unexplained contraptions and bones. 
WHITE (to Bumstead) Where do you think this goes? 
BUMSTEAD It sure isn't the fun-fair. 
The cart finally comes to a stop in a cave.  Bumstead, White and Schreber leap out and hide in a dark doorway, as a LONG LINE OF MYSTERY MEN walk past them. 
SCHREBER Follow me, and do exactly as I do. 
They join the end of the line, falling into step. 
INT.  DARK CHAMBER 
The MEN, with WHITE, BUMSTEAD and SCHREBER in tow, enter and sit in a number of rows of wooden chairs.  White and the inspector do the same. 
MORE MYSTERY MEN appear in circular portals high up on the concrete walls.  ONE MAN faces the others at the front of the room. 
MYSTERY MAN 1 Eleven past eleven  -  the Night of the Eye. 
The seated Men start to CHANT. 
MEN NIGHT OF THE EYE!  NIGHT OF THE EYE! 
A MAN in the front row stands. 
MAN 2 The Eye is too small for the head of the pin! 
MAN 1 Yes! 
ANOTHER MAN stands.  Next to the first, who sits again. 
MAN 3 What is it that floats on the water? The Eye! 
MAN 1 Indeed! 
So it goes around the room, each Man takes his turn announcing part of the strange ritual.  It will be White, Bumstead and Schreber's turn shortly.  White is worried, looks at the others. 
WHITE (whisper) What do we do? 
SCHREBER (hisses back) Fake it! 
BUMSTEAD What? 
SCHREBER is next  -  he stands abruptly. 
SCHREBER The eye.  Master of time and space! 
Then it's Bumstead's turn. 
BUMSTEAD The Eye  -  um  -  delicious with horseradish on rye! 
MAN 1 at the front seems confused for a moment  -  SEVERAL of the others turn towards Bumstead. 
MAN 1 (uncertain) Good. 
The inspector sits back down  -  whispers to White without looking at him. 
BUMSTEAD Nothing to it... 
White stands.  Hesitates.  Then: 
WHITE Eye...  eye, captain! 
White sits down, shaking his head, embarrassed. 
MAN 1 Um  -  yes... 
THE MAN NEXT TO WHITE rises up  -  keeps rising, FLOATS IN THE AIR above the Men's heads. 
MAN 4 My spine will bend for the Eye! 
He turns sideways, still floating. 
EXT.  ALLEY 
BACK ABOVE GROUND, Bumstead, White and Schreber run from the door at the end of the alley-way, tossing their masks away. 
BUMSTEAD Was that for real down there? 
SCHREBER I'm afraid so.

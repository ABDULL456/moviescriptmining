CAPT. MIKE You're a lucky bastard! All father's want to do is hold you down!.. Out on my father's boat, working da two-a-days... This littl' fat bastard, "tug Irish," what they calls them. They say the Irish the only one's stupid `nough to work a tug. Them and the Portuguese, as we all know how stupid them Portuguese is. I fin'ly get up the nerves and tell him... "I don't wanta spend da rest of my life on a goddamn tugboat...!" You know what I'm sayin'? 
BENJAMIN You didn't want to spend the rest of your life on a tugboat. 
CAPT. MIKE Absolutely, damn right! So you know what my father says? He says "Who the hell you think you are?" "What the hell you think you can do?" I tell him. "Well if you askin' -- I want to be a artist." He laughs. He says, "If God wanted you to be an artist he would made you one." "God wanted you to work a tugboat just like me, and that's what you goin' to do?" "Now, if I ever hear you mention art again, I'll throw you overboard!" Well, I went and I show him... I made myself an artist... 
And he suddenly takes off his shirt, pulls down his pants... And we see he's covered, from head to toe, with "his artwork," and incredible array of tattoos... 
CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D) A tattoos artist...! I puts every one on myself! 
And they look it, upside down sideways and backwards... 
CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D) You have to skin me alive to take my art away from me now! When I'm dead I'm going to send him my arm! (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
74   CONTINUED: (2)                                              74 CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D) Don't let anyone tell you different! You got to do what you meant to do! And I happen to be a god-damned artist! 
BENJAMIN (stating the obvious) But you're a tugboat captain. 
Which stops Captain Mike in mid rant... And he has no answer for... His only response is to glare at Benjamin... A back door opens, a slinky woman coming in... 
THE WOMAN Captain Mike, we're ready for you and your friend... 
CAPT. MIKE Let's go old timer... Break your cherry... This one's on me... 
As they go... 
CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D) (reconsidering) And here's you pay for today... Don't ever let anybody tell you Captain Mike didn't give a man what he deserved... 
BENJAMIN (looks at change he was given) I thought it was $2 for a day's work... 
CAPT. MIKE "you can't put a price on education..." 
75   INT. WHORE HOUSE, THE QUARTER, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1932    75 
Captain Mike and Benjamin in a small parlor where girls, both black and white, are sitting around... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) It was a night to remember... 
Captain Mike knows just who he wants and moves off with her... Benjamin left standing, not knowing what to do... None of the women seem to anxious to be with the old man...

ONE OF THE WOMEN He gives me the willies... 
ONE OF THE WOMEN (CONT'D) He's not for me, no ways... 
A thin Girl, maybe 19, of mixed ethnicity, decides to take a chance... 
THE GIRL How are you tonight, Grandpa? 
76    INT. A ROOM, WHORE HOUSE, FRENCH QUARTER - NIGHT, 1932         76 
And we see Benjamin and the girl sitting on a bed... And as she undresses him... First things first... tossing him a wash cloth... 
THE GIRL Clean yourself up... 
He doesn't know what she means.. Taking the wash cloth he goes over to the sink and does what he knows how to do, wash his face... 
BENJAMIN Is that any better? 
76A   INT. THE ROOM, WHORE HOUSE, FRENCH QUARTER - NIGHT, 1932       76A 
She's pushing him down, hiking up her skirt, all business... 
THE GIRL Let's go... Time's a wastin'... 
She climbs on top of him... And instinct takes over... But Benjamin being just a boy... and this being the first time, his excitement gets the immediate best of him... 
BENJAMIN Ohhh...! 
THE GIRL (hopping up) Come by anytime... 
She starts to leave... But Benjamin, who likes this an awful lot... 
BENJAMIN Again? 
(CONTINUED) 
76A   CONTINUED:                                                   76A 
THE GIRL Again? 
She looks and sees, sure enough... She climbs back on...the results are virtually the same if a bit longer 
THE GIRL (CONT'D) My hat's off to you old timer. 
She gets up to go...she's made it to the door... when Benjamin says... 
BENJAMIN Again? 
THE GIRL Again? 
She slows, turns to look... And sure enough... He's as ready as he's ever going to be... As she looks at him, a look bordering on amazement... 
77    INT. THE ROOM, WHORE HOUSE, FRENCH QUARTER - NIGHT, 1932      77 
THE GIRL What are you, Dick Tracy or something? I've got to rest... 
And that's just what she's doing... trying to catch her breath... 
BENJAMIN (in heaven) Again? 
78    INT. PARLOR, WHORE HOUSE, THE QUARTER - LATER STILL, 1932     78 
And we see Benjamin, at the door, happily smiling... 
BENJAMIN Thank you... 
THE GIRL (hurting) No, thank you... 
Benjamin, floating on air, hovering, never wants to leave... 
THE GIRL (CONT'D) Have a nice night... 
(CONTINUED) 
78   CONTINUED:                                                     78 
BENJAMIN You'll be here tomorrow? 
THE GIRL Every night, but Sunday... 
And she's finally able to go... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) It sure made me understand the value of earning a living... the things it can buy you.. 
Benjamin turns to leave... we hear footsteps... And we see a man, putting on a raincoat, coming downstairs from one of those other rooms... We see it's Benjamin's father... THOMAS BUTTON... Seeing Benjamin he slows... Benjamin, unaware of who he is, turns and goes out...

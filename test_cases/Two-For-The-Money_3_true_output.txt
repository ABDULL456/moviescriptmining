Hey, we just met.  I sure wouldn't want to start our relationship off by lying. 
TONI Well Walter could definitely use someone with a little resolve in his life. 
BRANDON (leaning in) 
Ya know, Toni, this is my first time in town.  I'm not used to how fast things run around here.  I'm wondering if you'd  like to have dinner tonight?  Let's get 
to know each other without so many people around. 
TONI ... He didn't tell you. 
BRANDON What? 
TONI Brandon, Walter and I are married. 
BRANDON What?  Walter just said I was meeting a woman.  He acted like... 
TONI Walter's got a weird sense of humor. 
Look, he has a big, bright, beautiful spirit, you'll love working for him, but he's held together by meetings.  If it has "anonymous" at the end, Walter goes.  He has to.  He also has to be very careful who he let's into his life.  In  most ways, Walter's brilliant -- but he can be bullshitted and I can't.  So he sends 'em over to me before he hires 'em. 
BRANDON You're kidding me?  Coming here... the manicure... this was an interview? 
TONI You're swift. 
BRANDON How'd I do? 
TONI Except for an illegal forward pass, 
perfect, flying colors.  Congratulations.  I'm late for my next appointment. 
TONI walks away, glances back, smiles and -- 
EXT. BROWNSTONE - DAY 
BROWNSTONE.  CAMERA favors the ground floor windows. 
WALTER vo 
The apartment on the first floor is yours.  You have satellite tv, a gym, you want to relax there's a jacuzzi tub the size of a kiddie pool. 
INT. BROWNSTONE - FIRST FLOOR - DAY 
900 number office.  A phone and a computer on an empty desk. Two TVs mounted on the wall.  WALTER shows BRANDON around. 
WALTER I'm starting you on the 900 numbers, same gig you did in Vegas. You'll make your picks and record them every day, once a day Monday through Friday and five times a day on weekends.  Each call's worth 25 bucks a shot.  Right now we get a few dozen hits a week.  We should be doing triple that.  I'm sending down some test copy.  Before you record it, a little advice. 
BRANDON sits.  Regards the phone -- 
WALTER Your pitch sucks, it doesn't exist.  The pieces are there, we just gotta bust you out. 
Brandon 
How? 
WALTER From now on you have a new name -- John Anthony, "The Million Dollar Man." 
BRANDON Hold on.  What's wrong with Brandon Lang? 
WALTER Brandon Lang is still at home with his mother.  You're selling a lifestyle here, and John's livin' large.  John's got a direct line to God and for a measly 25 bucks a call you're gonna let the world's losers listen in. 
INT. BROWNSTONE - 900 NUMBER OFFICE - NIGHT 
BRANDON studies the copy.  He pops in a CD, hits record, reads into a mike -- 
BRANDON Hello sports fans!  This is John Anthony in the Big Apple with my big money picks!  The action starts Saturday with college ball and our first matchup, Michigan against Indiana-- 
EXT. BROWNSTONE - DAY 
The upstairs window flies open and a CD sails out. 
WALTER VO Wrong! 
INT. WALTER'S OFFICE - SAME TIME - DAY 
WALTER turns from the window, faces BRANDON. 
WALTER What's your sales pitch? 
BRANDON What's my sales pitch?  77 percent's my sales pitch. 
WALTER Stats aren't enough!  These are gamblers 
you're talking to, people ready to risk what they can't afford for what they can't have!  You're selling the world's rarest commodity. 
BRANDOn 
What's that? 
WALTER Certainty in an uncertain world!

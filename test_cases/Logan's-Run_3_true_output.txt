JESSICA "Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife". What can all that mean? Just then their attention is focused by a distant SOUND as of SHOUTING -- a man's voice. Jessica stops. JESSICA Francis? Logan shakes his head. They EXIT cemetery toward capitol. 301X17	LONG SHOT - CAPITOL (MATTE COMPOSITE) 
Logan and Jessica walking up steps toward building. 
301X18	TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA 
Walking up the steps...many of which are cracked. 
They are proceeding with great caution...as they enter the Capitol Building.

301X20	CLOSEUP - LOGAN AND JESSICA 
SOUND: HAMMERING NOISE -- irregular. It stops after a bit. 
They walk to the door and open it cautiously. 
They EXIT right.

301X22A	CLOSEUP - A CAT SQUALLING OUT INTO CAMERA 
301X23	CLOSEUP - LOGAN AND JESSICA 
React, then they enter Senate and stop and look. 
301X24	INT. - SENATE - OVER LOGAN AND JESSICA'S BACK - A WHITE HAIRED MAN OF S SIXTY-PLUS 
There are HUNDREDS OF CATS...and THOUSANDS OF BOOKS all over the place. 
JESSICA (frowning; whispering) Look at his face...and his hair... (grimacing) Is that what it is to grow old? 
LOGAN (still stunned) It could be... 
There are a COUPLE OF CATS on the man's lap as he turns and faces Logan and Jessica...when he HEARS them move closer. 
The man is stroking the cats calmly...unperturbed by the appearance of Logan and Jessica. 
LOGAN How old are you? 
MAN As old as I am I suppose...who knows ? 
LOGAN Your hair is white. 
MAN It wasn't always. I remember when it wasn't. But it wasn't your color either. (looking at Jessica) ...or yours. I have my color somewhere. 
JESSICA Those cracks in your face...do they hurt? 
MAN Oh, no... 
JESSICA Could I touch them? 
MAN Oh, my...please try. 
Jessica walks up to the man and touches his face. 
JESSICA What's your name? 
MAN I've forgotten. It's been so long since I've used it. Logan and Jessica exchange a quick glance...feeling they have come upon a nutsy, fruitsy cupcake. MAN But all of my cats have names. LOGAN Is that what they're called-- cats? 
OLD MAN Yes, cats, of course. What else could they be? Cats. Of course each one has his own name too. JESSICA But there are so many of them. Do you know each one separately. OLD MAN Yes indeed, everyone. Actually, they all have three. (reciting) "The naming of cats is a difficult matter. It isn't just one of your holiday games. You may think at first I'm mad as a hatter when I tell you a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES." (a beat) An ordinary name and a fancy name. That's two. Do you want to guess what the third one is? Logan and Jessica are silent. 
OLD MAN (reciting again) "But above and beyond there's still one name left over, And that is the name that you never will guess; The name that no human research can discover -- - But THE CAT HIMSELF KNOWS, and will never confess." (reaching down and stroking another cat) Will you, my pet? One of the cats jumps off his lap. 
OLD MAN (reciting) "Why did you go little fourpaws? You forgot to shut your big eyes." (the man closes his eyes for a moment; then:) "I have a Gumble Cat in mind!" As the man opens his eyes: LOGAN How long have you been living here? OLD MAN For as long as I can remember. LOGAN What kind of place is this? OLD MAN Just a place, I suppose...who knows? 
The man looks puzzled. 
LOGAN How did you get here? 
OLD MAN I have always been here... 
LOGAN Are there any other humans? OLD MAN Gracious...no. 
LOGAN Have any other people ever passed through? 
The man shakes his head...then: 
OLD MAN But there may be a few around somewhere.

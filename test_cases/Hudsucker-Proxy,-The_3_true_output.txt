STREET 
FOLLOWING the bag as its owner carries it down the street. He pauses, sets it down. 
YOUNG MAN 
Fresh-faced, eager -- NORVILLE BARNES. He is gazing off at: 
WESSELS EMPLOYMENT AGENCY 
The sign is over a ground floor office; an exterior clock shows 9:00. A curtain is just being pulled open in its picture window to reveal a great job board. It is like the departures board in a great train station, with each of its individual entries flipping over occasionally to reveal a new opportunity. On offer are jobs like: PASTRY CHEF, STEAMFITTER, LAY-OUT MAN, GRAVEDIGGER, etc. 
REVERSE 
On the small crowd gathered to, like Norville, watch the board -- men in search of jobs, of various classes and vocations, but alike in their intent gaze, their hands dug into their pockets, their hats pushed back on their heads, bobbing occasionally to get a better view of the chattering board. Men occasionally head for the office as they see a prospect they like. 
Norville stands pat, watching. 
HIS POV 
An entry flips over to reveal EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT. 
NORVILLE 
He brightens. 
BOARD 
We PAN ALONG the executive entry to EXPERIENCE REQUIRED. 
NORVILLE 
He frowns. 
Around him, the crowd is thinning out as men trot in to apply for their respective jobs. 
We see other entries: JUNIOR EXECUTIVE. PAN TO EXPERIENCE ONLY. EXECUTIVE MANAGER... MUST HAVE EXPERIENCE. BUSINESSMAN... EXPERIENCED. 
The CROSS-CUTTING ENDS in a wash of SUPER-IMPOSITIONS PANNING OVER Norviille, now alone on the sidewalk: 
EXPERIENCED ONLY... EXPERIENCED... EXPERIENCED... EXPERIENCED... 
CUT TO: 
CLOSE SHOT - EXECUTIVE 
A middle-aged, mousy-looking man in a conservative suit and wire-rimmed spectacles is addressing his remarks to someone O.S. Behind the Executive we see only the skyline of New York City. 
EXECUTIVE -- So in the third quarter we saw no signs of weakening. We're up 18 percent over last year's third quarter gross and, needless to say, that's a new record... 
TRACKING 
DOWN the LENGTH OF the board room table. Executives line either side. We are APPROACHING the man at the far end of the table, to whom the report is being directed. 
He is late middle-aged, dressed expensively but conservatively, his attention smilingly fixed on the Executive who drones on. 
EXECUTIVE ...The competition continues to flag and we continue to take up the slack. Market share in most divisions is increasing and we've opened seven new regional offices... 
The TRACK has ENDED IN a CLOSEUP of the man at the end of the table, who still smiles benignantly at the droning Executive. The smile is serene, almost otherwordly. 
This is WARING HUDSUCKER. 
REPORTING EXECUTIVE 
He drones on. 
EXECUTIVE ...Our international division has also shown vigorous upward movement in the past six months and we're looking at some exciting things in R&D... 
The CAMERA SLOWLY PANS OFF the droning Executive as the big man's attention apparently wanders; we FRAME UP ON the picture window skyline of New York. 
EXECUTIVE (V.O.) Sub-franchising. Don't talk to me about sub-franchising; we're making so much money in sub-franchising it isn't even funny. 
FOLDED-BACK WANT ADS 
A hand with pencil goes down a list of positions, ticking each one: STREETSWEEPER -- EXPERIENCED; LINOTYPE MAN -- EXPERIENCED; CANTOR (REFORM) -- EXPERIENCED; SPARRING PARTNER -- EXPERIENCED. 
WIDER 
Norville, sitting at a coffeeshop counter, sets the pencil down. His chin is sunk disconsolately into his palm. 
His hat is pushed back dejectedly on his head. He idly stirs his coffee with his spoon. 
He takes one last gulp of the coffee, then sets the cup down on the want ads, stands, and digs into his pocket for change, turning it inside-out. 
CLOSE ON COUNTER 
As Norville puts all his change on the counter. His hand hesitates; he takes a little of it back. He LEAVES FRAME. 
A waitress's hand ENTERS from the far side of the counter. She clears away the saucer, then the cup -- which has been resting on the want ads. It leaves a perfect brown circle around one entry: 
THE FUTURE IS NOW. Start building yours at Hudsucker Industries. Low pay. Long Hours. NO EXPERIENCE NECESSARY. Apply Personnel, 285 Madison Avenue. 
As we hear the COFFEESHOP DOOR OPENING O.S., a draft wafts the sheet of newspaper off the counter and OUT OF FRAME. 
NEW YORK CITY SKYLINE 
Again LOOKING THROUGH the WINDOW as, O.S., the reporting Executive drones on. 
EXECUTIVE (O.S.) ...Our owned-and-operateds are performing far above expectations both here and abroad, and the Federal Tax Act of 1958 is giving us a swell writeoff on our plant and heavies... 
WARING HUDSUCKER 
looks dreamily out the window. His attention returns to the droning Executive and the benignant smile returns to his lips. 
EXECUTIVE ...The news in the money market isn't good -- it's excellent...

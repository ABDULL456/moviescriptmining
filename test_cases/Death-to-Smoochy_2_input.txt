He removes the knife from her throat and hurls it toward the bulletin board. It lands -- sticking right in the middle of a Smoochy card. 
CHICK Auf Wiedersehen, honey. 
They exit. 
INT. SHELDON'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT 
Nora is pacing.    Sheldon sits by the fire. 
NORA It's Stokes. He's behind the whole thing! He cut some kind of deal for the Smoochy slot! 
SHELDON What are you talking about? 
NORA He wants you out so he can put Takashi in! 
SHELDON Who's Takashi? 
NORA Jesus, Sheldon! Don't you ever pick up a copy of International Performer? He's the hottest kid show host from Asia. 
Sheldon's head is swimming. Suddenly the front door to to the penthouse bursts open. Randolph, dressed like he's about to do his old show, stumbles in waving a gun. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RANDOLPH Ah! How very cozy. Like two logs in a little bonfire. All we need is a few sticks and some wienies. 
He almost trips as he stumbles over to Sheldon.      He waves the gun in his face. 
RANDOLPH I had her before you! Pachyderm! I was in love with her! In love! And you snatched her away! Like a common thief! You're the bad guy! Not me! He's the bad guy, Nora. He's incapable of understanding the love we once had! Tender, yet passionate. Old-fashioned, yet experimental. (cackles) Tell him about a few of our experiments, Nora! Tell him! 
Sheldon looks stunned.    Nora hangs her head. 
SHELDON (to Nora) Is this true? Please tell me it's just the confused ramblings of a diseased mind. 
She looks at him, but doesn't say anything. 
SHELDON Holy mother of Toledo. When exactly were you planning to let me know about this?! 
NORA (turns to Sheldon) Listen, there was a time -- and I'm not proud of this -- but there was a time when I was a bit of a... kiddie-host groupie. 
RANDOLPH You're just another action figure for her collection! 
NORA That's not fair! 
RANDOLPH Tell him about Jingle Jackson! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SHELDON You dated Jingle Jackson? 
RANDOLPH The bells turned her on. Hey, tell him about Jumbo Johnny! There's a tale for ya! A whale of a tale! 
She looks down, somewhat ashamed.      A look of utter shock 
comes over Sheldon. 
SHELDON Oh good Lord in Heaven. 
NORA Look, what I did before I met you is none of your business. 
RANDOLPH Shut up!   Both of you! This is my show! 
He waves the gun threateningly as he backs up to an armchair and sits down. 
RANDOLPH Do you fully understand the power of a condemned man? Do you? I'm already wanted for one murder, why should I give a flaming horse's twat if I commit two more? 
SHELDON I... uh... read once that the best way to diffuse a tense situation is with a little humor. To that end, would you like to hear a funny joke? 
RANDOLPH (rolling his eyes) Oh, please. Go blow yourself, Martha. (waves gun again) Fix me a beverage, woman. Make me one of those drinks that used to make us all warm and fuzzy before bouncy-bouncy time! 
NORA Fix it yourself, asshole. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RANDOLPH (points to gun) Remember, I have Mr. Boomy. 
SHELDON I'm telling you, you'd love this joke. It revolves around Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny getting into a fender bender. 
Nora rolls her eyes and goes to the bar.

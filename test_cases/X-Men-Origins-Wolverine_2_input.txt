INT. OPERATING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
The male nurses transfer Logan from the gurney to the operating bed. One FEMALE NURSE prepares Logan's arm for an IV while a second NURSE cuts open his blood-soaked shirt with surgical scissors. The frenetic activity in the room ceases. Everyone stares at Logan's unblemished chest. 
SURGEON What is this? ( CO749TNnFn ) 
CONTINUED: Logan lunges forward, grabbing the surgeon's collar and pulling the startled man's face next to his own. 
LOGAN Where is he? 
MALE NURSE #1 Hey, hey, easy-- The male nurses struggle to restrain Logan but he's too strong for them. The surgeon gasps for air. 
LOGAN Where is he? 
STRYKER (O.S.) His name is Victor Creed. Logan turns and sees Stryker standing at the entrance to the operating room. STRYKER (cont'd) I can help you find him. 
EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY 
Logan storms out of the hospital, followed by Stryker. 
STRYKER He escaped from an ultramax penitentiary in Nevada last year. Started murdering mutants. Shape- changer in New Mexico, pair of telekinetic twins in California-- Logan turns on Stryker, grabbing the colonel by the throat and shoving him against a lamp post. 
LOGAN Three years I been here. Three years everything's good. Nobody knows me. And then one day you show up and the next day she's dead. 
STRYKER I came to warn you-- 
LOGAN You knew he was coming. f CONTTNfJRD 1 
CONTINUED: Stryker shakes his head as well as he can with Logan's hand on his throat. Stryker's face is turning red. LOGAN (cont'd) How did you know? 
STRYKER He got the List. 
LOGAN What list? Stryker chokes, gasping for air. Logan eases up on his grip but doesn't release the man. Stryker takes a deep breath. 
STRYKER The List. Every known mutant in North America. Government's been keeping it for years. Names, addresses, everything. 
LOGAN How did he get it? 
STRYKER Someone must have leaked it to him. There are people in Washington who want to see you all destroyed. Logan releases Stryker. The ex-colonel straightens his jacket collar and composes himself. 
LOGAN Creed's a mutant, too. 
STRYKER Apparently he doesn't have much tribal loyalty. Logan turns and walks away. He looks like a homeless man, his clothes torn and bloodied, his hair disheveled. He walks fast. Stryker calls after him. STRYKER (cont'd) Do you have a plan, Captain? 
LOGAN I'm not in the Army anymore.

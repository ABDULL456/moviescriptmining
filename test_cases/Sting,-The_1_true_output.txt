GONDORFF Ain't nothin' gonna make up for Luther, kid. (pause) Revenge is for suckers.  I been griftin' 30 years and never got any. 
Hooker just nods and walks out the door. 
INT. CAROUSEL 
We follow him past the Carousel which is now full of giggling prostitutes in various stages of undress.  Their childish frolicking is charming from a group usually so jaded, but it's lost on Hooker tonight. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. A CITY STREET - NIGHT 
It's late now and the street is deserted save for an occasional derelict or streetwalker on her way home from a night's work.  We pick up Hooker coming down the street toward his apartment building.  He walks slowly, almost reluctantly, as if he didn't care whether he ever got there or not. 
As he nears his building, he notices Loretta coming out of the diner across the street.  He stops and watches as she looks up and disappears into an adjacent building that advertises rooms for rent.  After a few seconds, we see a light come on in one of its second story windows. 
Hooker just stands there a second, debating with himself, trying to figure out a reason for doing what he's going to do anyway.  We follow him across the street to Loretta's building and: 
INT. LORRETA'S 
He goes up the stairs to the room where the light came on. He passes a couple of derelicts on the way.  He knocks twice and Loretta answers in her bathrobe.  She is more than a little startled to see him. 
LORETTA Looks like he missed ya. 
HOOKER Yeh, this time anyway. 
Loretta notices an old busybody peeping out at them from her room across the hall. 
LORETTA Good night, Mrs. Hillard. 
Mrs. Hillard quickly closes her door. 
HOOKER (shuffling a little) I, ah...thought you might wanna come out for a while.  Maybe have a drink or somethin'. 
LORETTA You move right along, don't ya. 
HOOKER (with more innocence than confidence) I don't mean nothin' by it.  I just don't know many regular girls, that's all. 
LORETTA And you expect me to come over, just like that. 
HOOKER If I expected somethin', I wouldn't be still standin' out here in the hall. 
Loretta looks at him carefully.  She knows it's not a line. 
LORETTA (with less resistance now) I don't even know you. 
HOOKER (slowly) You know me.  I'm just like you... It's two in the morning and I don't know nobody. 
The two just stand there in silence a second.  There's nothing more to say.  She stands back and lets him in. 
CUT TO: 
INT. GONDORFF'S ROOM - NIGHT 
A record spinning lazily on an old phonograph.  We hear Robert Johnson's "Come On In My Kitchen." Gondorff is sitting up in bed, with his hat on, lost in thought.  Billie is curled up asleep next to him.  There's a packed suitcase next to the bed.  Billie wakes up and turns over a second. 
BILLIE C'mon, Henry, knock off.  You've done everything you can. 
Gondorff nods his agreement like a zombie and goes right on thinking. 
CUT TO: 
LORRETA'S ROOM 
Hooker and Loretta are asleep against each other, their bodies illuminated every few seconds by the light from a neon sign across the street.  We dolly to the window and move in on another window in the building next door.  There's no light on in it, but we can discern the basic outline of a face behind the curtains, which are slightly parted to afford a view of Hooker's room by a black-gloved hand. 
"I said come on in my kitchen Cause it's gonna be rainin' outdoors." 
Music ends. 
FADE OUT. 
FADE IN: 
THE STING

COMMANDANT (CONT'D) Agu, come here, enh. Come here right now. Come here. These are the dogs who killed your father. 
Agu looks disdainfully at the man quivering on the ground beneath Commandant, blabbering incomprehensibly, shaking his head at Agu. Agu's nerves fire off. 
Out of the corner of his eye, ONE GOVERNMENT SOLDIER runs for the bush. He is nearly naked, his body glistens with his comrades' blood. 
No one seems to mind. Then, MUZZLE FLASHES out of the bushes at the end of the road. KWAP, KWAP-KWAP. Flesh explodes from the man's thigh and scatters to the ground. He falls without screaming. 
Our attention returns to the man held in front of Agu. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) Agu, you will kill this man. 
The Corporal moans dreadfully, pissing himself as he cries. The pool of urine from him and from Commandant is all around his flip-flops, mixing with blood. 
ARMY CORPORAL Please, Sah. I am an engineering student from the university in the capital. I am supposed to be fixing bridges, not be a soldier. 
Tears and snot run down his face. 
ARMY CORPORAL (CONT'D) Please don't be killing me. Just be making me your prisoner. Please, I can be helping you. 
HOPE Sah! 
Hope jumps into the SECOND truck with a fist full of maps. Griot follows him holding a box and offering it to Commandant. 
COMMANDANT Open it. 
Commandant and his entourage step back a little bit, just in case it's booby-trapped. 
GRIOT What is it? 
Griot holds up a surveying scope. He offers it to Commandant who turns it around when his Aide interrupts and hands Commandant his rifle. 
COMMANDANT No, no, this won't do. 
AIDE A pistol? 
CHIEF SECURITY OFFICER (CSO) That is too easy. 
TWO-I-C Why not the cutlass? 
CSO Does he have the strength? 
They look at Agu, who looks back, lost. They discuss amongst themselves, then point at his machete. 
COMMANDANT Rambo, seize him, hold his ass to the ground. 
Commandant unzips his pants and urinates on him. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) Agu. See this thirsty goat. These are the tyrants who murdered your father. (back to the Corporal) Now look at him. 
Agu grips his machete harder. 
POP. POP-POP The NDF Soldiers shoot NRC survivors. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) Remember what they have taken from you. Remember your suffering and turn it into hate for them. 
NDF Soldiers, having finished off the survivors, collect supplies and check the function of the engines of the vehicles. They start to transfer supplies onto the lighter vehicles. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) (in Agu's ear) God and the spirit of your Father is wanting you to kill him. 
Commandant grabs Agu's hand, the one holding the machete and squeezes his own hand around Agu's. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) Like this. Just bring this hand up and knock him well well. 
He takes Agu's hand and raises it high. Agu stares into the petrified man's eyes. He looks at his feet, urine and blood splattered on them. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) Use all of your force, imagine the blade sinking deep into him like chopping a coconut. 
Agu's face grimaces, as he gathers all his strength, he slams fiercely into the corporal's head. The blade splits the skin on the man's forehead and gashes his skull. 
The man screams an unbearable, screeching, grating sound. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) Yes! That is how you are dealing with the NRC. Do it again! And again and again until he shuts up. 
The NDF Soldiers hold the Corporal up, goading Agu on. 
Agu brings the machete up, swings it hard. KWOMP! 
The man's screams as sound grows dim.

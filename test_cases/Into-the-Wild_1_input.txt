He pulls over. Chris grabs his pack and exits the truck in front of a laundromat. As the truck pulls away, Chris sees a "Help Wanted" sign for Burger King on the laundromat window.

The place is packed with a line out the door. LORI, the second assistant manager, hurries back into the kitchen, where we find Chris in paper cap, bunning whoppers at a leisurely pace. LORI Chris, you gotta go faster.   We've got a line out the door. 
CHRIS (a bit oblivious) Okay. 
But then just continues on at his leisurely daydreaming pace. Lori is about to say something but by now she knows there's no getting through to him. She looks down to the floor where we see that Chris wears no socks. 
LORI (extending patience) Chris, I don't mean to be on you about everything. You're doing a great job. (MORE) 
LORI (CONT'D) I want to keep you on. And we all want to help you get to Alaska, but you've got to start wearing socks. 
CHRIS Right, right. I forgot. 
LORI And please.   Hurry.   We're ten deep. 
CHRIS Okay. 
But the pace remains.

Chris stands at the counter making a deposit with a YOUNG FEMALE TELLER. 
CHRIS How much do I have in the account now? 
TELLER It looks like...let me see. Including this latest deposit...One thousand, two hundred and fifty two dollars and...twenty-two cents.

We're TIGHT ON Chris' sock-less feet, pedalling away from the bank on a bicycle. The growing independence of his financial situation felt in the MUSIC OVER:

The casino lights of Laughlin, Nevada distantly in B.G. 
Chris pedals up a dirt path to find many of his belongings strewn about. And in particular, some food supplies have been torn into. A coyote yips in the distance as Chris finds his old straw hat torn to shreds. Across the desert, scurrying away beyond the tumbleweed, three young coyotes head for the hills. Chris picks up his tattered hat and smiles.

We are TIGHT on the PUNCHCLOCK as Chris' timecard comes into frame and is punched out. 
WIDEN OUT to see Chris taking off his paper hat and Burger King overshirt. 
He walks his timecard over to Lori.   The place is all but empty. 
CHRIS Lori, I'm punching out. 
LORI Okay.   Just put it in the drop. 
CHRIS No, I mean I'm punching out for good. 
LORI (happy for him) We've made our quota, have we? CHRIS Yeah. Also, I've got to do some things before I head north. 
LORI Alright Chris. Well, we've enjoyed knowing you. I won't be able to get that last check to you right away though. 
CHRIS That's okay.    I'll let you know where to send it. 
LORI Alright then Chris.    Bye-bye now. 
CHRIS Bye-bye.

he sets his lacrosse stick down and starts to leave. 
COACH MARSHALL Christ!  I didn't say you were out of the game! 
OZ Sorry, coach. 
COACH MARSHALL What the fuck is this?  You got someplace more important to be? 
Coach Marshall is fuming.  The entire team is staring at Oz. 
OZ Yeah. 
He runs off. 
ANGLE ON JIM AND KEVIN IN THE STANDS 
A beat of confusion.  Then they stand up. 
EXT. MSU CAMPUS - DAY 
Oz runs through a gate. 
INT. BACKSTAGE - DAY 
The vocal jazz group is on their feet, lined up, waiting to go onstage.  Oz bursts into the room, still in his lacrosse gear. 
VOCAL JAZZ GUYS Oz -- You're back -- Yeah -- 
ALBERT -- Oh, great. 
Oz rushes up to Heather.  She's happy but confused. 
HEATHER What about the game?! 
OZ I'm not playing. 
HEATHER You're missing the game for us?! 
OZ No.  I'm missing the game for you. 
Heather melts.  Oz pulls her close.  And they kiss. 
VOCAL JAZZ TEACHER Okay, okay.  You guys got about a minute to go.  Spend it warming up, not making out.  This ain't the prom yet. 
Oz and Heather share a smile. 
INT. MUSIC HALL STAGE - DAY 
The vocal jazz group is belting their hearts out, singing "How Sweet It Is."  Oz sings with them now in his vocal jazz outfit...we TILT DOWN to see he's still wearing his cleats.  He and Heather sound great, backed by the vocal jazz group.  They sail through their duet, join hands, and finish perfectly.  The audience APPLAUDS with enthusiasm -- and we Kevin and Jim, WHOOPING AND CLAPPING, loving it, like they're at a rock concert. 
JIM Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww! 
KEVIN (gives that "You rock!" hand sign) You fuckin' rule! 
INT. EAST GREAT FALLS - CLASSROOM - DAY 
Class has just ended, students are filing out of the classroom.  A teacher grades papers in the back of the room, routinely writing "A, A-, A, A-" on each paper. Vicky is studying a pull-down map hanging over the chalkboard.  Kevin comes up next to her. 
KEVIN Hey... 
VICKY Did you know that it's...450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville? 
KEVIN It's like a six or seven hour drive. That's easy, I don't mind driving. 
A beat.  Kevin looks back over his shoulder to the inattentive teacher.  Moves closer to Vicky. 
KEVIN (CONT'D) About the other day...I've been thinking. 
VICKY So have I.  And I know you want to make things perfect for me.  And I understand that you really wouldn't tell me that until you were 100% comfortable with it. 
Vicky looks over to the teacher, who COUGHS.  She steps closer.  Kevin, somewhat nervous, takes the bottom of the map, fidgeting with it a little. 
VICKY (CONT'D) And I want to make things perfect for you.  You're right, Kev, we do have something good...and special. 
KEVIN Yeah, we have something great, Vick. 
VICKY Kevin... (very close, whispered) I want to have sex with you. 
The map goes FLAPPING upwards.  The teacher looks up. 
KEVIN (almost frightened) Now?! 
VICKY No...I know the perfect time... 
She looks to the calendar on the wall...and taps next Saturday -- "Prom."  Kevin can't believe it...MUSIC UP for PRE-PROM MONTAGE --

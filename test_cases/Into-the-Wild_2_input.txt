76   INT. CABARET BAR, CARTHAGE - LATE AFTERNOON                76 
Chris sits at the end of the bar with Gail Borah. 
CHRIS I've been thinking a lot about Alaska. 
GAIL Alaska? What kind of nut-nut are you? Alex, it's October for Christ's sake. You go to Alaska, you go in the Spring. This time of year you wanna head south. Personally, I like Las Vegas. One-armed bandit. That's what I like. 
CHRIS Yeah, maybe I ought to put off going to Alaska, at least so I can get settled up there in decent weather. 
GAIL South. You want to go south. You want me to take you out to the highway? 
CHRIS (putting on his cowboy) Little lady, I walked in, I can walk out. He puts a few bills down on the bar, saddles up his backpack, and gives Gail a hug. 
GAIL You take care of yourself now, Alex. You got a whole family here depending on it. 
CHRIS I will. Thanks Gail .   And tell Wayne, I'll drop him a line. 
He gives her a kiss on the cheek and he's off.

CUT TO: 
79   EXT. COLORADO RIVER, STRETCH OF THE GRAND CANYON - DAY      79 
Chris disembarks the long-haulers truck, waves a goodbye, and the truck moves on. 
SERIES OF ANGLES: Chris walking south through the desert following the river bank. He covers twelve miles before he arrives in an Arizona town, a dusty weigh-in station. 
80   EXT. ARIZONA TOWN - NIGHT                                   80 
The town is quiet but along the storefront lane where Chris walks, he comes upon a sporting goods store. In the window, a fiberglass river kayak. Chris stares at it. CUT TO: 
81   EXT. INTERSTATE UNDERPASS - NIGHT                           81 
We HEAR passing cars humming above. Chris has set up camp and he's digging in the dirt. He buries many of his belongings. He makes sure he's got his check from working with Wayne in his pocket. He packs only the essential items, burying all else. He gets into his sleeping bag and goes to sleep.

CUT TO: 
82    INT. RANGER'S STATION - LEE'S FERRY - DAY                 82 
Chris approaches the GREEN-SUITED FUNCTIONARY at the front desk. 
GREEN SUIT Can I help you? 
CHRIS Yeah. If I wanted to paddle down the river, where's the best place to launch out of? 
GREEN SUIT "To launch out of?" What's your experience level? 
CHRIS Not much. 
GREEN SUIT Any?   Do you have a permit? 
CHRIS A permit for what? GREEN SUIT You can't paddle down the river without a permit. If you like, you can apply for one here, get yourself some experience, and I'll put you on the wait-list. 
CHRIS Wait-list?   To paddle down a river? 
GREEN SUIT That's right. 
CHRIS (giggling) Well, how long do you have to wait? 
GREEN SUIT I've got an opening May 2003. 
CHRIS (laughing) Twelve years? 
GREEN SUIT Well, you could always join a commercial raft trip and go with a licensed guide. They usually have a few last minute cancellations. I think it's about two- thousand dollars. 
Chris busts a gut. 
CHRIS Thanks for your help. 
The Green Suit eyes Chris' departure with suspicion.

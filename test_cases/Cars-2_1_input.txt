Zundapp is still furiously hitting the button as Holley drops into view just beyond the glass. 
Freaked, Zundapp does a 180 and SMASHES out a plate glass window, lands on a ridiculously large balloon tethered to the ground, and speeds off --- 
INT. ADJACENT LUXURY BOX - CONTINUOUS 
The LEMONHEADS watch, baffled, as Zundapp drives away. 
J. CURBY GREMLIN The Professor's on the run. 
TUBBS PACER Someone's gotta get McQueen. 
VLADIMIR TRUNKOV Get McQueen!! 
Grem and Acer are already out the door --- 
EXT. SIDE STREET - SAME 
Finn speeds into view, in time to see Zundapp turn a corner out of sight. 
FINN Holley. I'll get Zundapp, you help Mater. 
EXT. TRACK - SAME 
Holley, still in the air, turns --- 
HOLLEY Got it! 
FARTHER UP THE TRACK - Holley THUNDERS past Francesco and out of sight. 
FRANCESCO What is happening?! 
EXT. STREETS OF LONDON - SAME 
Finn screams around a corner, sees --- 
--- Professor Zundapp, speeding toward docks along the Thames where a COMBAT SHIP waits. 
COMBAT SHIP Hurry, Professor! 
ON ZUNDAPP - With Finn gaining fast, he accelerates. Suddenly --- WHAP! 
He's been TETHERED by Finn with tensile cables now attached to his rear end. Zundapp SCREAMS like a little girl. 
FINN Do you really think I'm going to let you float away, Professor? 
Finn reels him in. Zundapp spins his wheels, caught. 
Suddenly Zundapp miraculously, inconceivably, GAINS TRACTION! Now it's FINN'S WHEELS that are spinning. 
ON THE COMBAT SHIP - the ELECTROMAGNET has been turned outward and switched on. He's PULLING ZUNDAPP AND FINN IN with the magnetic force. He pulls out a laser, TARGETS it at Finn's windshield. CUT TO: 
EXT. LONDON STREETS - SAME 
Mater, still towing McQueen, rockets around a corner, zips down another street --- 
MATER McQueen, let go! 
MCQUEEN Never! 
They pass a Gremlin with a headset. 
ON GREM AND ACER - Down another side street. They get this message, take off in the opposite direction. 
CUT BACK TO: 
EXT. DOCKS NEAR THE THAMES - CONTINUOUS 
FINN, tires squealing, loses more and more ground to the boat. Zundapp, the "rope" in this tug-of-war, buckles under the tension. 
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP Give it up, McMissile! 
Finn releases a mess of bullets, grenades, and other weaponry into the air --- 
THE MAGNET SUCKS it in quickly like a black hole --- 
THUNK! It all sticks to the magnet, right next to Finn's bullets. They're BOMBS, GRENADES, ROCKETS and one little detonator with a flashing, beeping light. 
Off the boat's RXN --- CUT TO: 
ANOTHER PART OF LONDON, AT STREET LEVEL 
KA-BOOOOOOM! A distant explosion (miles away) festoons into the air, visible over the rooftops. Holley suddenly WINGS into view. She sees --- 
Mater and McQueen, speeding up the street. 
HOLLEY Mater, stop! 
MATER No way! You could get hurt! 
Then she looks over, catches a glimpse of GREM AND ACER, bearing down on them from a side street. They're going to broadside Mater and McQueen. 
HOLLEY Oh no. 
ON MATER AND MCQUEEN - They're not aware of the impending impact. 
Holley DROPS FROM THE SKY, hits the pavement, SKIDS into the path of the AMCs and DEFLECTS THEM. They FLIP OVER Holley, Finn and McQueen and sail --- 
--- INTO A PUB --- 
--- where they skid across the room and SLAM into the bar, knocking a ROW OF BEER MUGS to the ground. 
IN THE PUB - MOMENTS LATER

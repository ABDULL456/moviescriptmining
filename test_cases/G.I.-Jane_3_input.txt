MCCOOL Maybe half.  Not even. 
JORDAN Grab an oar, find a way to weight it down, we're gonna need it.  Cortez, help him.  Flea?  You take one of the two full minis -- and just follow my lead. 
CORTEZ What, we're gonna pry 'em out with paddles? 
MCCOOL (grabbing her) O'Neil.  Our air's gonna crap out as soon as we get down there.  You know that, don't you? 
JORDAN So I guess we get one shot at it.

THE CHIEF Why'd it have to be her...

JORDAN Sir, let me suggest you stop giving orders and start doing exactly what I say, because that's the only way we're all getting out of here.  Now how's your vest check out?  Still good? 
EXT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY 
McCool's air craps out.  He abandons his oar and swims for the surface.  That leaves only... 
Cortez, struggling mightily to keep the escape route open. He knows his mini-tank is running on empty -- and it scares the bejeezus out of him. 
INT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY 
JORDAN Flea, take the pilot up slow, feed him air.  Chief, sir, you and I are gonna take the express elevator outta here.  Remember to let your air out.  Ready?

Doing a 360, Jordan spots... 
Seafox One coming their way. 
Jordan waves like a shipwreck victim. 
Not slowing, Seafox lowers a recovery rig into place: They're wasting no time on the pick-up. 
Remembering the last time she tried this, Jordan gets a death-grip on the Chief's vest.

HUGH grabs at WHIP's collar and WHIP actually sits up and reaches for HUGH, a nice sign of life from WHIP. 
CHARLIE WOAH!!! WOAH!!! WOAH!!! Enough! 
CHARLIE pulls HUGH away from WHIP who falls back on the bed. 
CHARLIE (CONT'D) What time is it? 
HUGH 9:14, the hearing is in 46 minutes. 
CHARLIE How much grace do you think we got? 
WHIP Amazing grace...how sweet the sound...that saved a wretch like me- 
HUGH Shut the fuck up you drunk... 
WHIP I once was lost and now I'm found was blind but...now...well I'm still kinda blind. 
CHARLIE We probably have an hour before we really need to get him to the hearing and it's just downstairs. 
HUGH We need a wheel chair. 
WHIP Call Harling Mays. 
CHARLIE Harling's got a wheel chair? 
WHIP Harling's got cocaine. 
HUGH Cocaine? Cocaine?! 
HUGH and CHARLIE exchange a desperate look... 
CHARLIE WHAT'S HIS NUMBER!? 
HUGH This is fucking insane. And criminal. 
WHIP 609-237-1184. We're in 609 so just... 
CHARLIE (DIALING) 
WHIP 129 Tell him I need bananas... 129 
INT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL -- WHIP'S ROOM -- MORNING 
CHARLIE prays for a voice on the other end...it appears... 
CHARLIE Harling? Harling this is Charlie. I'm a friend of Whip's...yeah. We need you to do a very early, very discreet...uhm...Whip needs bananas and you need to bring them to The St. Jerome Hotel downtown...how many bunches of bananas? (Whip holds up 3 fingers) 3 is the answer I'm getting -- you will be well compensated...the The St. Jerome Hotel room 1027... 
CHARLIE hangs up and looks at WHIP who is mostly passed out again. CHARLIE looks to HUGH. 
INT. THE. ST. JEROME HOTEL -- ELEVATOR BANK -- SAME TIME 
The elevator opens and we see HARLING step from the elevator with his knapsack over his shoulder. Teva sandals, sunglasses. 
INT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL -- WHIP'S ROOM -- MORNING 
WHIP has a towel around his neck as he tries to sip coffee. CHARLIE sits opposite him at the small table by the window. 
The door bursts open, and HARLING storms in. 
HARLING MAYS (SINGING) Come mista tally man tally me banana...Whip, what's the deal man you look like you're hurtin' for certain...shut the door, interior lock! 
HARLING places a leather doctor's bag on the table. An anxious CHARLIE reaches for the bag which sets HARLING into a frenzy. 
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) YOU DO NOT TOUCH THE MERCH MOTHERFUCKER!!! 
It's quiet as HARLING gives orders. 
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) Everyone except Whip and myself take three steps away from the table. 
As they step away, HARLING now pulls a beautiful silver- framed mirror from his bag and a blue coke grinder, he calmly but sternly delivers orders... 
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) I need three things. (focuses on Charlie) Two glasses of water, a credit card and a hundred dollar bill. 
CHARLIE All I have is a twenty. 
HARLING MAYS (takes the card and bill) That'll do. And I need to make a coco puff. 
HARLING Tosses a pack of smokes to CHARLIE. 
CHARLIE A what? 
HUGH takes the smokes from CHARLIE and pulls out a cigarette. 
HARLING stops grinding, opens the lid and pours out a nice smooth pile of coke. He begins a masterful ballet of cocaine manipulation. 
HUGH Millions of dollars hang in the balance. 
HUGH is removing the last quarter of an inch of tobacco from the end of the cigarette. 
CHARLIE They hang on the consumption of a 300 dollar bag of cocaine. 
HARLING uses the credit card to groom the coke into neat piles and lines. He has a system. 
WHIP's head sags as he again appears ready to pass out. 
HARLING MAYS Okay Whip, just two small whiffs first...one on each side...just a primer. 
Using the mirror as a tray, HARLING holds the rolled up 20 dollar bill just above the line of coke. WHIP slowly manages to place his face in position to ingest the coke. It's tense as his head wobbles. He finally zeroes in and snorts the first line. HARLING quickly switches nostrils. WHIP sniffs the other side. 
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) Atta boy, head back now. Swallow. Water, chief, you! Water.

Larry covers his ears with both hands. 
LARRY I can't hear this.  I'm an attorney, Vince, and you're just an honest casino owner.  Object of a witch hunt. Innocent victim. 
VINCE Keep the message vague, but let 'em know.  The price has gone up.  Christy Van Cartier -- a quarter of a million. Dead or nearby. 
Vince looks grim and vindictive, as he gets into the car. 
EXT. CONVENT VEGETABLE GARDEN - DAY 
The vegetable patch is located behind the convent, on a patch of land surrounded by high walls.  Various sections have been partitioned with string and then furrowed. 
Several nuns are working in the patch, weeding and raking. They wear large, ungainly straw hats over their wimples. 
Christy has been given a hoe and a straw hat.  She is hacking at the dirt, with great disinterest.  She picks up a carrot from the vegetable patch; she looks around to see if anyone is watching.  She starts to gnaw on the carrot. She becomes aware that someone is watching her.  She looks up. 
Sister Mary Robert is watching Christy eat the carrot, breaking her fast.  Christy drops the carrot on the ground, as if it burned her.  Mary Robert resumes hoeing in the next furrow over. 
Christy stares at Mary Robert, narrowing her eyes. Christy looks around; all the other nuns are busy at their tasks.  Christy decides that she will try and make Sister Mary  Robert talk.  She picks up the carrot and tosses it at Mary Robert.  Mary Robert jumps.  She waggles a finger at Christy, scolding her.  Mary Robert resumes hoeing.

Christy is now determined.  She takes her hoe, and tiptoes nearer to Mary Robert.  Very gently, she uses the handle of the floe to lift Mary Robert's skirt, and gooses her. 
Mary Robert vips, very loudly.  All the other nuns turn and stare at Mary Robert, scolding her.  Christy waggles her finger at Mary Robert, scolding her. 
Christy, giggling to herself, resumes hoeing.  She sees Mother Superior, standing at the end of the furrow.  Mother Superior looks extremely grim; she has not missed anything. 
EXT. SUNSET - THAT NIGHT 
LONG SHOT of the sun going down, ending the nuns' Vow of Silence. 
We hear Christy SCREAM, O.S. 
INT. CONVENT HALLWAY - THAT NIGHT 
This hallway is marked by a series of heavy wooden doors with tiny, grilled windows.  These are the cells where the nuns sleep.  Nuns are entering their cells and closing their doors for the night. 
Mother Superior glides down the hall, followed by a dusty, bedraggled Christy.  Christy is devouring a slice of brown bread. 
CHRISTY Is this all the food I get? 
MOTHER SUPERIOR Yes.  Until breakfast. 
CHRISTY That's tomorrow!  Don't you have any snacks?  Machines? 
They stop by a door. 
MOTHER SUPERIOR This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence. 
CHRISTY My what? 
MOTHER SUPERIOR Your cell.  Your room. 
INT. CHRISTY'S CELL 
The door swings open, and Mother Superior and Christy enter.  The room is tiny, with bare plaster walls.  There is a narrow wooden bed, with a thin muslin-covered mattress.  There is a small nightstand and a wooden stool.

CHRISTY (looking around) You were right the first time.  Is this like, solitary?  The cooler?  Where's the furniture? 
MOTHER SUPERIOR Our lives are simple.  We have little need for material possessions. 
CHRISTY Right, sure thing.  But what about, like, appliances?  Like a little color portable?  Boom box? 
MOTHER SUPERIOR Useless distractions. 
CHRISTY (sinking to the bed) It's like the Stone Age.  The room time forgot.  What about a phone? 
MOTHER SUPERIOR And whom would you call? 
CHRISTY Oh, I don't know... Satan? 
MOTHER SUPERIOR (not amused) Your cell is more than adequate. 
CHRISTY Right.  So what do we do now?  Ping- Pong?  Row over to the monastery? 
MOTHER SUPERIOR It is nine p.m.  Pleasant dreams. 
CHRISTY Wait.  No.  You're kidding.  Lights out? At nine?  My day's just starting. 
MOTHER SUPERIOR I'm sure.  If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life.  And its direction.  Or lack thereof. 
CHRISTY (indignant) What's wrong with my life? 
MOTHER SUPERIOR From all I've heard, just about everything.  Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead. (MORE) 
Page 33 
MOTHER SUPERIOR (CONT'D) If you're fooling anyone, it's only yourself.  God has brought you here. Take the hint. 
Mother Superior leaves. 
After the door shuts, Christy stands and looks out the one small window in her cell.  She leans her head against the wall.  She is trying not to think about what Mother Superior has said.  Still, the mess her life has become overwhelms her.  She fights back tears.

The grounds are immaculate and huge, exquisitely kept and beautifully laid out. A gathering is around the pool and lawn area, where TREVOR and his team are having an exhibition for their guests. Polite applause is COMING FROM THE CROWD, ALL WELL-DRESSED AND OBVIOUSLY WELL-HEELED. 
ANGLE ON TREVOR As he knocks out an opponent. ANGLE ON CROWD Applauding. ANGLE ON TREVOR Taunting a different opponent. Trevor executes a beautiful technique and puts the guy down and out. ANGLE ON TEAM (Psychologist, therapist, masseur, etc.) who are cheering Trevor on. ANGLE ON TREVOR As he plays with the next fighter. 
TREVOR 
They said you were good... ha! 
He knocks the guy out with a picture perfect kick. There is no denying that he's a superior fighter. 
TREVOR (CONT'D) 
Can't you get me any quality sparring partners? 
The next guy comes up, but before they can start, the psychologist, DR. PFEELGUT, calls for "Time" and motions Trevor over. 
PFEELGUT 
It's    not enough just to win, Trevor. You have to destroy your    opponent completely, mentally and physically. Beat him    once, he's a threat. Humiliate him, and he'll fear you    forever. 
Trevor listens to this, nods his head once, and when Pfeelgut goes to leave, Trevor pushes him into the pool. Pfeelgut comes to the surface, smiling. PFEELGUT (CONT'D) Exactly! Trevor goes back to the ring. He really takes it      to this guy, alternately playing with him and hurting him. As      the guy tries to hold his own, the string to his pants comes loose      and they start to fall down. He grabs for them with both hands, and      Trevor starts to back up, laughing with the rest of the group. 
ANGLE ON PFEELGUT Toweling off, who is yelling to Trevor. PFEELGUT (CONT'D) 
GET HIM! NOW!! Trevor looks at him for a moment, not really understanding, then sees what the psychologist is saying. He lunges immediately forward and (in SLOW MOTION) knocks the guy out while he is still trying to pull his pants up. ANGLE ON CROWD AS THEY ENJOY THE SHOW IMMENSELY Trevor has learned the lesson of the day, and he walks off. INT. TREVOR HOUSE ­ SAME DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TREVOR BEING PAMPERED BY HIS ENTOURAGE The masseur is massaging his shoulders, a woman is doing a pedicure and another is doing a manicure. An exercise physiologist is going over a computer print out with Trevor, when an old Korean master, MASTER KIM, comes into the room. 
TREVOR 
Ah, Master Kim. 
(to physiologist) 
I'll look at these stats later. 
Trevor indicates a seat near him, much lower than the one he is sitting in. The Korean master prefers to remain standing. 
TREVOR (CONT'D) 
Are all you guys named Kim? So, what did you think? 
KIM 
(thick accent) 
You velly good fighter... 
TREVOR (CONT'D) Learn English, will ya? And, tell me something I don't know... KIM 
A mountain lion doesn't ponder his weakness, and is therefore vulnerable. TREVOR (after a beat) 
Well, I'm pretty damn tired of this fortune cookie crap. (beat) You're history. Chaunce, get ride of the bum. 
The butler, CHAUNCY, comes forward and walks up to Master Kim. 
CHAUNCY Very good, sir. TREVOR Don't come here any more, you hear? Over a little more to the left, Sam. The masseur nods and adjusts his technique accordingly. TREVOR (CONT'D) It's hard being me, you know. So much pressure... EXT. COLISEUM ­ DAY People are streaming into the large building. The marquee out front reads "Diamond Nationals". 
INT. COLISEUM ­ SAME DAY 
ESTABLISHING MONTAGE OF TOURNAMENT: CROWDS AND COMPETITORS.

Competitors warming up (wall front stretch, very high; one guy kicking another in the head ­ tap, tap, tap; two man routine practicing ­ another one jumps in?; two beautiful girls sparring; crowd assembling; group of kids waiting ­ call comes over public address system, they run off; stand outside selling high tech equipment; different styles of fighter's clothes ­ camo, stars & stripes, "headhunter"; stern 9 year old girl doing kata; two toddlers barely seen through their safety equipment fighting furiously; two twins doing identical kata; breaking; etc.) 
ANGLE ON DREW AND KWAN 
Walk into the area ­ Drew is dressed in the ill-fitting handmade suit by Mrs. Rodriguez. People recognize him as he walks past. 
ANGLE ON TREVOR Making his entrance. He is in a perfectly laundered and pressed suit, and his assistant is carrying another suit pressed and ready to go. COMPETITOR

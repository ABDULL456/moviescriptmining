Osbourne strides grimly down the dock in his bathrobe, hatchet in hand. 
137   INT. "GOOD MORNING, SEATTLE" SET - DAY                          137 
Sandy Pfarrer is sitting in an armchair on a morning show living room set surrounded by a dozen eight-year-olds sitting on the carpet. Hosts Del and Connie sit next to her in swivel chairs. 
SANDY (reading) And it was just then----at that very moment----that Oliver sneezed---- 
DEL Can    we just----I'm sorry to interrupt but    we have to let the folks at home see    this illustration! Can we just get    a shot of that... 
He is holding the book open, face out on his lap. 
DEL (CONT'D) There----there it is. Oliver. Interrupting the filibuster with---- 
CONNIE That's wonderful! 
DEL Wonderful! The book is "Point of Order, Oliver!" and the talented author is Sandra Pfarrer. We're gonna go to a station break and then be right back with Bud Fraighling, the Sultan of Salad, and Part Two of our special interview with Dermot Mulroney. So keep it where it is! 
Del and Connie and Sandy all wear smiles that stay fixed a beat too long. Then Del relaxes and turns to Sandy. 
DEL (CONT'D) ...Great segment. 
SANDY Thank you. 
DEL Yeah, you know we thought it might be fun if you joined us with Bud Fraighling and help make the Fiesta Salad, when we move over. 
CONNIE Over on the kitchen set. 
SANDY That wasn't discussed. 
DEL Oh, sure! No! Only if you want to! Your segment went great, we just thought---- 
SANDY I'm sorry, I made plans. 
DEL Okay, great! 
CONNIE Great to see you again, Sandra! 
She gives them a cold smile as a technician finishes unclipping her lavaliere and she leaves. 
Connie looks at Del and mouths "Bitch." 
138   EXT. COX TOWNHOUSE - DAY                                        138 
Osbourne's crumple-backed car roars up. It cuts a corner of the lawn and squeals to a halt in the drive. Osbourne emerges, still in robe and pyjamas, with the hatchet. 
He goes to the front door and bashes at the knob with the blunt end of the hatchet. 
OSBOURNE New... fucking... keys... How's this for access... 
Hardware starts to fall off and jangle onto the stoop. Osbourne tries the sharp end of the hatchet a couple times, decides he prefers the blunt end. 
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) ... How's this for motherfucking access... 
More things fall off.    The knob wobbles in the door. 
Osbourne pushes the door open. 
139   INT. STUDIO - HALLWAY - DAY                                     139 
Sandy Pfarrer is accompanied by a bright young PR woman. 
PR WOMAN That was way out of line. We were so unbelievably clear with them: just an Oliver segment. 
SANDY It's fine. 
PR WOMAN Del and Connie are such putzes. 
SANDY It's fine.     Thank you.   We're finished. 
PR WOMAN Huh?   Well, okay. Great, uh---- 
Sandy, entered her dressing room, is already shutting the door on her. 
140   INT. STUDIO DRESSING ROOM - DAY                                140 
Inside a man lounges reading a magazine.   He looks a little like Harry but younger. 
SANDY Thought that would never be over. 
The man rises and kisses her. 
MAN Mmm.    Me too. 
SANDY Let me scrub this crap off my face. 
141   INT. COX TOWNHOUSE KITCHEN - DAY                               141 
Osbourne opens a cabinet, muttering: 
OSBOURNE Just for starters... 
He takes out liquor bottles and starts putting them in a packing case on the kitchen counter. 
142   EXT. WASHINGTON MALL - DAY                                     142 
People sit on benches eating lunches. Harry Pfarrer is on the bench where he and Linda met, once again spitting sunflower seeds.

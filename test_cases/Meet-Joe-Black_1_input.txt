DREW 'It's up to Joe', huh? 
QUINCE Yeah, that's what he said. 
DREW Well, that's very interesting. 
Drew gazes intently over at Joe who is crossing to Susan, for the moment by herself near the piano. 
QUINCE I thought so, too.  Joe's a neat guy. 
DREW Yeah.  Neat. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Joe approaches Susan. 
JOE I wanted to apologize, Susan -- 
SUSAN I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'. 
JOE Well, now I am sorry.  For intruding on you this afternoon. 
SUSAN It wasn't an intrusion.  And if it was, it turned out to be welcome. 
JOE I appreciate you -- 
SUSAN Excuse me? 
JOE I mean I appreciate that. 
SUSAN And I appreciate you, too. 
A moment between them. 
JOE (delighted) You do?  Well, thank you very much. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Drew crosses over to Parrish. 
PARRISH I was a little abrupt with you this afternoon, Drew.  Forgive me.  I want you to know I value your advice. 
DREW As much as Joe's? 
Parrish doesn't answer. 
DREW (cont'd) Who is this man?  He's giving ubiquitous a bad name. 
A moment. 
PARRISH You're competitive soul, Drew. That's what makes you a great addi- tion to the money.  Joe is just... around. 
DREW For how long?  And why? 
PARRISH Please.  Don't worry about him.  And above all, don't antagonize him. 
Drew glances over at Joe. 
DREW Boss's orders, huh?  I'm great at following them.  And I think I'll start right now. 
Allison calls out from the other side of the room: 
ALLISON Dinner's ready, everybody! 
A BUZZ as Coyle opens the doors to the dining room and the family files in, Drew lingering behind with Joe. 
DREW I have a confession to make to you, Joe. 
Joe just smiles in response. 
DREW (cont'd) Do you want to hear it? 
JOE (pleasantly) No. 
DREW Well, I'm going to tell you anyway. I did cheat on that exam at Groton. But so did twenty-six other guys, and nobody ever mentioned it until today.  And I'm expecting you won't mention it again.  I don't know who you are and where you're getting your information, but I'm willing to pretend I did not hear it, and let bygones be bygones.  But can I tell you something else, it'd be nice to see the big guy without you next to him.  What are you, his shadow?  Do you hold his dick for him when he goes to take a leak?  You know some- times somebody would like a few min- utes alone with W.P.  That means without you.  Okay, pal?  Let's eat. 
INT. DINING ROOM, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT 
Everyone eating silently but looks are exchanged, glances averted, Allison notices Susan and Joe looking at each other, Drew observes Parrish watching Joe, Quince, on the other hand, just eats. 
Breaking the silence, Parrish chinks his glass, stands. 
PARRISH -- I - uh - want to thank you all for coming - uh - my family -- 
Everyone at the table is all attention. 
PARRISH (cont'd) -- Allison and Quince, Susan -- and the other members -- 
He glances at Joe, stops. 
PARRISH (cont'd) -- I'm so happy when we can get together -- I mean I know you all have busy lives -- 
SUSAN Look who's talking. 
ALLISON (a laugh) Yeah, speak for yourself. 
PARRISH Anyway -- I remember when you were little girls -- 
An awkward pause.  Quince chooses to fill the silence. 
QUINCE I love little girls -- 
Allison elbows him. 
PARRISH And now you're all grown up -- and I'm - uh - um -- 
Parrish struggles to keep his emotions in check, Drew clocking his behavior very carefully. 
PARRISH (cont'd) I had some words all prepared but now I've forgotten them - uh - um - wait a minute. 
Silence, everyone waiting for Parrish to proceed. 
PARRISH (cont'd) Uh, it's gone...um -- it was on the tip of my tongue.

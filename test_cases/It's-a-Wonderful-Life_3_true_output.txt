He picks up the belt and throws it over her arm. 
GEORGE Your... your caboose, my lady. 
MARY You may kiss my hand. 
GEORGE Ummmmm... 
Holding her hand, George moves in closer to Mary. 
GEORGE Hey  hey, Mary. 
Mary turns away from him, singing "Buffalo Gals": 
MARY (singing) As I was lumbering down the street... 
George looks after her; then picks up a rock from the street. 
GEORGE Okay, then, I'll throw a rock at the old Granville house. 
MARY Oh, no, don't. I love that old house. 
MEDIUM LONG SHOT  OLD HOUSE 
It is a weather-beaten, old-fashioned two-storied house that once was no doubt resplendent. 
GEORGE No. You see, you make a wish and then try and break some glass. You got to be a pretty good shot nowadays, too. 
MEDIUM CLOSEUP  GEORGE AND MARY 
MARY Oh, no, George, don't. It's full of romance, that old place. I'd like to live in it. 
GEORGE In that place? 
MARY Uh-huh. 
GEORGE I wouldn't live in it as a ghost. Now watch... right on the second floor there. 
MEDIUM LONG SHOT  OLD HOUSE 
George hurls the rock at the house. We hear the SOUND of a window breaking. 
EXT. FRONT PORCH OF HOUSE  NIGHT 
CLOSE SHOT 
We see a grumpy old man in shirt sleeves in a rocking chair on the porch. He looks up as he hears the breaking glass. 
EXT. STREET  NIGHT 
CLOSEUP  GEORGE AND MARY 
MARY What'd you wish, George? 
GEORGE Well, not just one wish. A whole hatful, Mary. I know what I'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next year and the year after that. I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and I'm going to see the world. Italy, Greece, the Parthenon, the Colosseum. Then I'm coming back here and go to college and see what they know... and then I'm going to build things. I'm gonna build air fields.  I'm gonna build skyscrapers a hundred stories high. I'm gonna build bridges a mile long... 
As he talks, Mary has been listening intently. She finally stoops down and picks up a rock, weighting it in her hand. 
GEORGE Are you gonna throw a rock? 
MEDIUM LONG SHOT 
The old deserted house. Mary throws her rock, and once more we hear the SOUND of breaking glass. 
GEORGE Hey, that's pretty good. What'd you wish, Mary? 
Mary looks at him provocatively, then turns and shuffles off down the street, singing as she goes. George hurries after her. 
MARY (singing) Buffalo Gals, can't you come out tonight... 
George joins her in the singing as they proceed down the street. 
MARY AND GEORGE (singing) ...can't you come out tonight, can't you come out tonight. Buffalo Gals can't you come out tonight and dance by the light of the moon. 
GEORGE What'd you wish when you threw that rock? 
CLOSE SHOT 
Man on the porch of house, listening to George and Mary. 
MEDIUM CLOSEUP  GEORGE AND MARY 
They have stopped walking and now face one another. 
MARY Oh, no. 
GEORGE Come on, tell me. 
MARY If I told you it might not come true. 
GEORGE What is it you want, Mary? What do you want? You want the moon? Just say... 
LONG SHOT 
Full moon shining through the trees. 
BACK TO SHOT  GEORGE AND MARY 
GEORGE ...the word and I'll throw a lasso around it and pull it down. Hey, that's a pretty good idea. I'll give you the moon, Mary. 
MARY I'll take it. And then what? 
GEORGE Well, then you could swallow it and it'd all dissolve, see? And the moonbeams'd shoot out of your fingers and your toes, and the ends of your hair. (pauses) Am I talking too much? 
MEDIUM CLOSEUP  MAN ON PORCH OF HOUSE 
As George finishes talking, he jumps up out of his chair: 
MAN Yes!! Why don't you kiss her instead of talking her to death? 
CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND MARY 
GEORGE How's that? 
MEDIUM CLOSEUP  MAN ON PORCH 
MAN Why don't you kiss her instead of talking her to death? 
CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND MARY 
GEORGE Want me to kiss her, huh? 
CLOSE SHOT  PORCH OF HOUSE 
MAN Aw, youth is wasted on the wrong people. 
As he speaks, the man leaves the porch and goes into his house, slamming the front door.

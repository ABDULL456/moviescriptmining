And then Gru's ship appears hovering above them! Modified as a jelly-dispensing weapon and with Dr. Nefario at the controls! The minions hang on the sides holding JELLY BLASTERS. 
The ship opens fire on the evil minions, transforming them. POP! POP! POP! POP! One by one they transform back into yellow minions. One of the Minions wipes the horrible tasting jelly off his tongue. 
Dr. Nefario sticks his head out the side of the ship. 
DR. NEFARIO Hello, Gru! 
GRU Hey, hey!    Nice work, Dr. Nefario! 
Gru leaps onto the ship. 
DR. NEFARIO I put an antidote in the jelly. (beat) I mean, I'm happy to create an evil army to destroy the world, but nobody messes with my family. 
GRU Thank you, Doctor!   Now let's go get the-- 
Gru looks over to see Margo, Edith and Agnes onboard the ship, holding jelly blasters. DESPICABLE ME 2              CINCO & KEN DRAFT   94. 
AGNES Hi! 
Gru is flabbergasted.    He turns to Nefario. 
GRU You brought the girls? 
DR. NEFARIO Yes! (beat) Oh.     Was that wrong? 
Gru's ship flies toward El Macho, blasting purple minions all along the way. 
From behind a large jelly gun Edith unloads round after round. 
EDITH Wooooo!    Yeeeaaahhh! 
El Macho witnesses his evil minions being converted back to regular ones. 
EL MACHO Oh no! What's happening to my minions? (beat) Gru? 
Gru turns to Nefario and the girls. 
GRU You guys take care of the rest of the minions. (beat) I'm going to find Lucy. 
Gru leaps out of the ship down to the roof El Macho is on. He has two big jelly weapons in his hands. 
Meanwhile the ship flies off with its jelly blasters firing, and comes to land on the ground below. 
The minions and the girls start jumping from the ship.    Agnes takes aim. 
AGNES Eat jelly, you purple freaks! Waaaaah! DESPICABLE ME 2           CINCO & KEN DRAFT     95. 
Agnes' gun is a little too big for her and the kick sends her a bit out of control. But she still manages to hit a number of Evil Minions. The tide is turning. 
Meanwhile, Gru has gone ballistic on the evil minions.   BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! He takes the remaining few out. 
El Macho kicks an evil minion at Gru, but he manages to hit it with jelly and transform it back to yellow. Gru holds his gun up to El Macho and gives him a threatening look. 
GRU It's over, El Macho.   Now where is Lucy? 
EL MACHO (chuckles) Let me show you. 
He turns to a computer and pushes a button. 
A fountain stops spewing water and underneath it STEEL DOORS open from the ground. And out of them rises a ROCKET. Strapped to it is Lucy. Tied to a SHARK with TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS OF DYNAMITE strapped to her. 
Gru is horrified.   He GASPS. 
LUCY Oh, hey Gru! Turns out you were right about the whole El Macho thing, huh? (unconvincingly) Yay! 
El Macho calls to Gru, brandishing a remote. 
EL MACHO One push of this button and I send that rocket straight into the same volcano where I faked my death. Only this time--it's for real! 
GRU (horrified) No! 
Dave swoops in on a rope and grabs the remote, Tarzan- style... 
DAVE Tally ho! DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT    96. 
But unfortunately he smacks a roof support and drops the remote. It bonks a bunch of minions on the head and lands on the ground.

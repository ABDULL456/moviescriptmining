{"train": "INSIDE THE CAR -- \nMiles accelerates as he and Jack wave back. \nJACK Where the fuck were you, man? I was dying in there. We were supposed to be a hundred miles away by now. \nMILES I can't help the traffic. \nJACK Come on. You're fucking hungover. \nMILES Okay, there was a tasting last night. But I wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up. Check out the box. \nJack turns around, and starts rooting around in a CARDBOARD WINE BOX. \nMILES Why did you tell them my book was being published? \nJACK You said you had it all lined up. \nMILES No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum... \nJACK Yeah, Conundrum. \nMILES ...and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor. She was supposed to hear something this week, but now it's next week, and... It's always like this. It's always a fucking waiting game. I've been through it too many times already. \nJACK I don't know. Senior editor? Sounds like you're in to me. \nMILES It's a long shot, all right? And Conundrum is just a small specialty press anyway. I'm not getting my hopes up. I've stopped caring. That's it. I've stopped caring. \nJack sits back in his seat holding up a bottle of CHAMPAGNE and TWO GLASSES. \nJACK But I know it's going to happen this time. I can feel it. This is the one. I'm proud of you, man. You're the smartest guy I know. \nJack now begins to remove the foil from the champagne bottle. \nMILES Don't open that now. It's warm. \nJACK Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it. \nMILES That's a 1992 Byron. It's really rare. Don't open it now. I've been saving it! \nJack untwists the wire. Instantly the cork pops off, and a fountain of champagne erupts. \nMILES For Christ's Sake, Jack! You just wasted like half of it! \nJack begins pouring two glasses. \nJACK Shut up. (handing Miles a glass) Here's to a great week. \nMILES (coming around) Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass behavior, I'm really glad we're finally getting this time together. \nJACK Yeah. \nMILES You know how long I've been begging to take you on the wine tour. I was beginning to think it was never going to happen. \nThey clink and drink. \nJACK Oh, that's tasty. \nMILES 100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore. \nJACK Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark? \nMILES Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron. \nJACK Just tell me. \nMILES Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color. \nJACK (not really listening) Sure is tasty. \nEXT. FREEWAY - DAY \nThe Saab heads north. \nINT. SAAB - DAY \nThe boys continue to drink and drive. \nMILES Did you read the latest draft, by the way? \nJACK Oh, yeah. Yeah. \nMILES And? \nJACK I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something. \nMILES How about the new ending? Did you like that? \nJACK Oh yeah. Much better. \nMILES There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same. \nJACK Well, then I guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different. \nINT. GAS STATION #1 - DAY \nMiles is pumping gas. Jack is stretching his legs nearby or perhaps cleaning the windshield. \nA CELLPHONE RINGS. Jack reaches into his pocket. \nJACK (looking at the phone) It's Christine. (snapping it open) Hey you. \nApproaching the front door, Miles pulls a BOUQUET OF FLOWERS out of a plastic grocery store bag. Jack carries a bottle of CHAMPAGNE. \nMiles pulls a BIRTHDAY CARD out of the bag too. \nMILES Wait a second. \nHe pulls a PEN from his pocket and signs it. As he licks the envelope, Jack rings the bell. \nMoments later PHYLLIS comes to the door. She is a matronly older woman in a nightgown and housecoat. \nMILES AND JACK Surprise! Happy Birthday! \nThe boys offer up the flowers and champagne. Phyllis slurs slightly as she speaks -- she's been doing some celebrating of her own. \nPHYLLIS My God. Miles. And Jack! What a surprise. I can't remember the last time you brought me flowers. \nThey hug. \nJACK They're from both of us. \nPHYLLIS A famous actor bringing me flowers on my birthday. Don't I feel special? \nMILES A famous actor who's getting married next week. \nPHYLLIS Oh, that's right. Isn't that nice? I hope that girls knows how lucky she is, marrying no less than Derek Summersby. \nThe boys follow her inside. \nINT. MILES'S MOTHER'S CONDO - CONTINUOUS \nJACK Jeez, Mrs. Raymond, that was eleven years ago. \nPHYLLIS Well, you were wonderful on that show. I never understood why they had to give you that brain tumor so soon. Why that didn't make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin. It's a sin. \nJACK Yeah, well, you should be my agent. \nPHYLLIS If I was, I would sing your praises up and down the street until they put me in the loony bin. Now Miles, why didn't you tell me you were coming and bringing this handsome man? Look how I'm dressed. I've got to run and put my face on. \nJACK You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond. \nPHYLLIS (over her shoulder) Oh, stop it. Make yourselves comfortable. (now around the corner) You boys hungry? \nMILES Yeah, I'm hungry. \nJack gives Miles a look. \nMILES (low) Just a snack. Calm down. \nMiles leads Jack into this small condo. The TV is on, and it's MESSY. Amid the newspapers and junk mail and dishes, an AB-ROLLER and an ancient SCHWINN EXER-CYCLE sit forgotten in a corner. \nINT. MILES'S MOTHER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT \nMiles finishes twisting ice trays into a MOP BUCKET as it fills with water in the sink. He puts the champagne in and carries it into the -- \nINT. MILES'S MOTHER'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nHe takes a seat on the sofa next to Jack, who is watching WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE? \nMILES Let me show you something. The secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released, you keep pressure on it so you don't -- \nJACK (concentrated on the TV) Just a second. Guy's going for $2500. \nMiles finishes opening the bottle with an elegant silence. \nPHYLLIS (O.S.) Ready for my close up! \nThe boys turn to see Phyllis now dolled up in thick make-up and a PANTSUIT. Her eyebrows are painted and cock-eyed. Overall she looks much worse than before. \nPHYLLIS Oh, champagne! Miles, why don't you bring that out onto the lanai? I thought we could eat on the lanai. \nEXT. MILES'S MOTHER'S LANAI - NIGHT \nMiles and Jack are seated in webbed chairs around a circular glass table. They are mid-meal. \nEveryone is more than a little lubricated, especially the birthday girl as she returns from the kitchen with another plate of food. \nJACK Mrs. Raymond, this is delicious. Absolutely delicious. \nPHYLLIS (sitting) They're just leftovers. \nJACK Is it chicken? \nPHYLLIS I could have made something fancier if a certain someone had let me know that a certain someone was coming for a visit with a certain special friend. Could have made a pork roast. \nMILES It was a surprise, Mom. \nPHYLLIS And I could have already put clean sheets on the other bed and the fold- out. You are staying. Wendy, Ron and the twins are picking us up at 11:30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton. They do a magnificent job there. Wendy is so excited you're coming. \nSilence. Jack freezes, his fork halfway to his mouth. \nMILES You talked to Wendy? \nPHYLLIS Just now. She's thrilled. And the kids. \nMILES (trying to be chipper) Yeah, well. You know, Jack's pretty eager to get up to... you know, but, uh, yeah. We'll see how it goes. \nPHYLLIS Well, you boys do what you want. I just think it would be nice for us to be together as a family on my birthday. \nMILES Uh-huh. (wiping his mouth) I'll be right back. \nHe gets up and heads into the house. \nMILES As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place. \nJACK Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages. \nMILES It's not worth it. You pay too big a price. It's never free. \nThey eat in silence a moment. \nJACK You need to get laid. \nMiles shrugs off the comment. \nJACK It'd be the best thing for you. You know what? I'm going to get you laid this week. That's going to be my best man gift to you. I'm not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit. \nMILES I'd rather have a knife. \nJACK No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books. \nMILES I'm working on it. \nMiles concentrates on his eggs and hash browns \nJACK You still seeing that shrink? \nMILES I went on Monday. But I spent most of the time helping him with his computer. \nJACK Well, I say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax? \nMILES And Lexapro, yes. \nJACK Well, I say fuck that. You need to get your joint worked on, that's what you need. \nMILES Jack. This week is not about me. It's about you. I'm going to show you a good time. We're going to drink a lot of good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and send you off in style. \nJACK And get your bone smooched. \nJack spots the waitress coming out of the kitchen and motions for more coffee. She nods and smiles, indicating she'll be right over. Jack returns the smile and holds up a hand to signal he'll wait. Jack turns back to see Miles watching him. \nJACK What? \nEXT. CENTRAL COAST - DAY \nIn a series of shots, the Saab -- now with its TOP DOWN -- makes its way onto the 101 and travels past landmarks that those familiar with the Santa Barbara area might recognize. \nMUSIC accompanies this sequence that anchors us into the rhythm of a road trip. \nINT./EXT. SAAB - DAY \nThe car now descends the Santa Ynez Mountains and heads toward Buellton. Miles and Jack must SHOUT to be heard in the open car. \nMILES You know what? Let's take the Santa Rosa turnoff and hit Sanford first. \nJACK Whatever's closest, man. I need a glass. \nMILES These guys make top-notch Pinot and Chardonnay. One of the best producers in Santa Barbara county. (looking out the window) Look how beautiful this view is. What a day! \nJACK I thought you hated Chardonnay. \nMILES I like all varietals. I just don't generally like the way they manipulate Chardonnay in California -- too much oak and secondary malolactic fermentation. \nEXT. SANTA ROSA TURN-OFF - DAY \nThe Saab passes over the 101 and turns onto SANTA ROSA road. \nINT./EXT. SAAB - DAY \nThe boys now pass vineyards of immaculate grapevines. \nMILES Jesus, what a day! Isn't it gorgeous? And the ocean's just right over that ridge. See, the reason this region's great for Pinot is that the cold air off the Pacific flows in at night through these transverse valleys and cools down the berries. Pinot's a very thin-skinned grape and doesn't like heat or humidity. \nJack looks at Miles, admiring his friend's vast learning and articulateness. \nThe Saab now pulls of the road and makes its way down a long gravel DRIVEWAY. \nJACK Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel sells. \nMILES Thanks, Jack. So do I. (noticing) Here we are. \nEXT. SANFORD TASTING ROOM - DAY \nMiles brings the car to a stop in the parking lot. As they get out and walk -- \nMILES So what'd you guys finally decide on for the menu? \nJACK I told you. Filet and salmon. \nMILES Yeah, but how are they making the salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry? \nJACK I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish? \nMILES Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference. \nJACK (taking out his phone) Let me call Christine. \nMILES Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste. \nJACK I owe her a call anyway. \nMiles must curb his eagerness to go inside the tasting room as Jack SPEED DIALS. \nJACK Hey, honey. So we're up here about to taste some whites, and we need to know how the caterers are going to make the salmon. \nCHRIS We like it. \nJACK (to Miles) You know, you could work in a wine store. \nMILES Yeah, that would be a good move. \nNow Miles notices something about Jack. \nMILES Are you chewing gum? \nJACK Want some? \nEXT. SOLVANG, CALIFORNIA - DAY \nThe Saab passes through this Danish-themed tourist town. \nSUPERIMPOSE -- \nSOLVANG \nEXT. BUELLTON, CALIFORNIA - DAY \nThe Saab makes its way into this very average-looking Central coast town right off the freeway. \nSUPERIMPOSE -- \nBUELLTON \nEXT. WINDMILL INN - DAY \nThe Saab pulls into the parking lot of this motel. And look -- there's the WINDMILL itself, its decorative blades motionless. \nINT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY \nMiles and Jack enter the room and throw their suitcases onto their respective beds. \nLATER -- \nThe sounds of a SHOWER and OFF-KEY SINGING come from the bathroom while Miles sits impatiently on the bed. He pounds on the wall. \nMILES Hey Jack, hurry up! \nJACK (O.S.) Just a minute! \nOpening the bedside drawer, Miles finds a GIDEON'S BIBLE and tosses it in the trash -- apparently his hotel routine. \nEXT. HIGHWAY 246 - DUSK \nFreshly showered and dressed for dinner, Miles and Jack amble along the shoulder of this busy local two-lane highway. They pass a mall and a car dealership. \nJACK I thought you said it was close. Now I'm all pitted out. \nMILES It's not even a mile. \nJACK We should have driven. \nMILES Not with the wine list these people have. We don't want to hold back. \nJACK You think I'm making a mistake marrying Christine? \nMILES Whoa. \nJACK Come on, do you think I'm doing the right thing? Tell the truth. You've been through it. \nMILES Well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to Christine for some good reason. So I think it's great. It's time. You've got to have your eyes open, that's all. I mean, look at me. I thought Victoria and I were set for life. \nJACK Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff. \nMILES So you're going to stop acting? \nJACK No way. This would just provide some stability is what I'm saying. I can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along. \nMILES Uh-huh. \nJACK We're not getting any younger, right? And my career, well, it's gotten pretty, you know, frustrating. Even with my new manager. Maybe it's time to settle down. \nMILES If that's what feels right. \nJACK (convincing himself) It does. Feels right. \nMILES Then it's a good thing. \nJACK (nodding, feeling better) Yeah. It's good. Feels good. \nMiles leads them away from the road and across a parking lot. The camera PANS to reveal -- \nTHE HITCHING POST, a local institution. \nINT. HITCHING POST BAR - DUSK \nMiles and Jack belly up. GARY, the Samoan bartender, spots Miles and extends a welcoming hand. \nGARY Hey, Miles. Long time no see. \nMILES Gary. \nGARY When's that novel of yours coming out?  We  all want to read it. \nMILES Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week. \nGARY (shaking Jack's hand) My condolences. \nWAITRESS Okay. And you? \nJACK (glaring at Miles) Pigs in a blanket. With extra syrup. \nEXT. LOVELY HIGHWAY - DAY \nThe Saab winds along this beautiful road that meanders through large open vineyards. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINSERT -- \nA MAP and a MOVING LINE show the boys' route. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINSERT -- \nGRAPES growing on the vine. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. VINEYARD - DAY \nFramed by foreground grapevines, the Saab passes in the distance. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. FOXEN WINERY - DAY \nMiles has just downed a taste of red wine. \nMILES How much skin and stem contact? \nPOURER About four weeks. \nMILES Huh. That explains all the tannins. And how long in oak? \nPOURER About a year. \nMILES French or American? \nPOURER Both. \nMILES Good stuff. \nJACK Yeah, oak. That's a good wood. \nJust as the pourer turns away toward other TASTERS, Jack GRABS the bottle and helps himself and Miles to another glass. They slam back their drinks like tequila. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. LOVELY AREA ON A HILL - DAY \nMiles brings the Saab to a stop, and the guys get out. Before them lies an incredible view of endless vineyards. \nMILES Nice, huh? \nJACK Beautiful. \nMILES Victoria and I used to like this view. (lost in nostalgia) Once we had a picnic here and drank a '95 Opus One. With smoked salmon and artichokes, but we didn't care. \nJACK Miles. \nMILES She has the best palate of any woman I've ever known. She could even differentiate Italian wines. \nJACK Miles, I gotta tell you something. Victoria's coming to the wedding. \nMILES I know. You told me. I'm okay with it. \nJACK Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried. \nMILES She what? (long pause) When? \nJACK About a month ago. Six weeks. \nMILES To that guy? That guy with the restaurant... \nJack nods. Miles looks down at his shoes and draws a long breath. Then he stiffly gets back in the open car and closes the door. \nJACK Miles... MILES... \nMiles continues to stare straight ahead. \nJACK (exploding) Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out! \nMILES I want to go home now. \nJACK You've been divorced for two years already. People move on. She has! It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes you feel special or something. \nMILES Is she bringing him to the wedding? \nJACK What do you think? \nMILES You drop this bombshell on me. Why didn't you tell me before? \nJACK Because I knew you'd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn't even come on this trip. But then I figured here would be the best place to tell you. We're here to forget about all that shit. We're here to party! \nMILES (undeterred) I'm going to be a fucking pariah. Everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if I'm going to get drunk and make a scene. Plus Tony fucking Levin? \nJACK No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool. \nSTEPHANIE This is our Estate Syrah... \nShe pours each of them a full HALF GLASS. \nJACK You're a bad, bad girl, Stephanie. \nSTEPHANIE I know. I might need to be spanked. \nShe notices the boring couple, visibly annoyed that she has been monopolized. \nSTEPHANIE Excuse me. \nAs she wanders down the bar, Jack turns to Miles, his mouth wide open. \nJACK A bad girl, Miles. She might need to be spanked. \nMILES Do you know how often these pourers get hit on? \nThey glance down the bar at Stepanie. She smiles back. \nEXT. KALYRA WINERY PARKING LOT - DAY \nMiles is killing time by the car staring at his shoes. He looks over and sees Jack waddling over from the tasting room with TWO CASES OF WINE. \nJACK Get the trunk. \nMILES You have the keys. \nJack puts the cases down and glances back at the building. \nJACK We're on. \nMILES What? \nJACK She called Maya, who's not working tonight, so we're all going out. \nMILES With Maya? \nJACK Been divorced for a year now, bud. \nJack puts the wine in the trunk, and they get in the car. \nJACK Stephanie, holy shit. Chick had it all going on. \nMILES Well, she is cute. \nJACK Cute? She's a fucking hottie. And you almost tell her I'm getting married. What's the matter with you? (drumming on the steering wheel) Gotta love it. Gotta love it. \nINT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY \nTHE TV -- \nGOLF on ESPN. \nMILES AND JACK \nsit transfixed, each on his own bed. The curtains are drawn. Then out of nowhere -- \nJACK (mocking) You know how often these pourers get hit on? (getting up) I'm going for a swim. Get the blood flowing. Want to come? \nMILES Nah. I want to watch this. \nCLOSE ON THE TV -- \nA guy gets ready to putt. The announcer whispers what an important moment this is. The guy misses. \nFADE TO BLACK. \nUNDER BLACK -- \nThe sound of an AEROSOL CAN. \nJACK Miles. Hey, Miles. Time to get up. \nWE OPEN OUR EYES TO SEE -- \nJack spraying his feet with some Dr. Scholl's product. \nWIDE -- \nMiles pulls himself out of bed and slouches toward his suitcase. \nJACK Fucking chick in the Jacuzzi -- goddamn, Miles, fucking going nuts up here. Whole place is wide open. Assylvania. \nJack does some actor's weird warm-up stretch. \nMILES So what should I wear? \nJACK I don't know. Casual but nice. They think you're a writer. \nAs Miles begins to dig through his suitcase, Jack flips open his cellphone and speed-dials. \nJACK Don't you have any other shoes? \nMiles glances as his shoes sitting sadly on the floor. \nJACK (into the phone) Hello? Oh hey, baby, just checking in. Not much. We're about to go out for dinner, probably be out pretty late, so I thought I'd say goodnight now. I know, I love you too. I miss you. \nEXT. LOS OLIVOS - NIGHT \nThe boys get out of the car and walk along a timbered sidewalk in this tourist town with wine tasting rooms and gourmet restaurants. \nMiles draws a long breath. \nSTEPHANIE What's everyone ordering? Then we can sort out the wine. \nMILES Exactement! \nJack shoots Miles a look. \nMAYA I'm having the salmon. \nMILES That's what I'm having. \nSTEPHANIE (still scanning the wines) I'm thinking about the duck breast. \nJACK (slapping his menu shut) Me too. \nMAYA Well, that narrows things down. \nStephanie lowers the menu so that only her eyes peer over the top. She looks at the others, and they look back at her. \nSTEPHANIE Sounds like... Pinot Noir to me. \nJack looks at Miles and raises one hand for a HIGH-FIVE. \nJACK Pinot! \nMiles reluctantly slaps Jack's hand. This causes the girls to laugh. MUSIC STARTS -- they're OFF! \nDINNER is improvised, but includes: \n-- The arrival of the FIRST WINE. \n-- The SALADS. \n-- Maya takes a turn with the wine list. Miles pushes her finger down into the prices with THREE DIGITS. \n-- New stemware is provided with the arrival of the SECOND WINE. \n-- The four of them DRINK. Particularly Miles. \n-- Stephanie and Jack get cozier and cozier. \n-- The SALMON and DUCK arrive. \n-- Miles is too shy to look into Maya's eyes. She's interested and available -- it's too much for him. \n-- As Miles gets DRUNKER, the camera angles become sloppier, the cutting choppier. \n-- Miles PONTIFICATES about some aspect of wine that Maya and Stephanie find interesting. Left out in the cold, his jaw tight, Jack wants to find a way in but can't. \n-- Miles reaches over to refill his glass, but Jack's arm shoots out to stop him -- \"Slow down.\" \nCLOSE ON MILES as a distant RUMBLE begins to sound, the rumble of an oncoming ANXIETY ATTACK. By now he has drunk so much that he spaces out, descending into -- \nINT. UNDERWORLD - DARK AND TIMELESS \nMiles is boarding an OPEN BOAT atop this underground river, the River Styx. Just beyond a ghoulish HUMAN CARGO the hooded boatman CHARON wields a long staff. Miles is crossing over to the dark side. \nINT. LOS OLIVOS CAFE - BACK AGAIN \nMiles returns to earth to find Jack and Stephanie now in their own little world -- Jack explaining something to Stephanie that she finds fascinating, just FASCINATING. \n-- Miles converses with Maya, but it's clear from her bemused expression that he's being charming if not entirely coherent. \n-- ANOTHER WINE reaches the table -- a Comte Armand Pornrnard. \n-- Miles looks over at Jack and Stephanie. They share a short but sensual kiss. \nMOMENTS LATER -- \nMiles is on his feet threading his way through the tables. He is very unsteady, and we cut between first and third person perspectives. \nAT THE BATHROOMS -- \nHe tries the MEN'S ROOM door but it's locked. He pulls the XANAX out his pocket and pops one in his mouth, swallowing it dry. \nHe notices a PAYPHONE nearby. Thinking better of it for a moment, Miles makes a drunken bee-line for the receiver. \nCLOSE ON THE KEYPAD -- \nas many numbers are dialed, and we HEAR the TONES, completely out of sync, along with a sound melange of interior phone RINGING and a PICKUP. \nTHE RECEIVER -- \nAs Miles presses it desperately to his head. \nVICTORIA (ON THE PHONE) Hello? \nMILES Victoria. \nVICTORIA (ON THE PHONE) Miles? \nMiles feigns an implausible upbeat tone. \nMILES Victoria! How the hell are you? \nVICTORIA (ON THE PHONE) Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind? \nMILES Heard you got remarried! Congratulations. Didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round. \nVICTORIA (ON THE PHONE) Oh, Miles. You're drunk. \nMiles looks at the water, takes it and drains it. \nThe girls now return to the table. The guys slide over. \nMILES (trying to appear sober) Should we get dessert? \nSTEPHANIE We were thinking. Why don't we go back to my place? I've got wine, some insane cheeses, music, whatever. \nJack raises both arms like a football referee. \nJACK Excellent idea. Waiter! \nINT. SAAB - NIGHT \nTHROUGH THE WINDSHIELD -- \nTrees and bushes lit by the headlights show us we're headed into the woods. \nINSIDE -- \nJack drives. Miles blinks heavily as he tries to make a sense of A HAND-DRAWN MAP. \nJACK (grabbing the map) Let me see that. \nEXT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe Saab pulls into a gravel DRIVEWAY and comes to a stop outside this wood-framed cottage. \nJack and Miles get out and head for the front door. On the way, Jack reaches into his coat pocket and produces a string of FOUR CONDOMS. \nJACK (tearing) Here. One for you, three for me. \nMiles wordlessly takes his. Just before they climb the porch steps -- \nMILES You sure you want to do this? \nJack stops and looks at him for a moment with almost hostile incredulity. \nTHE FRONT DOOR is open. Jack knocks twice on the SCREEN DOOR before going in. \nINT. STEPHANIE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nThe boys enter this modest living room furnished with weathered but charming old furniture. Scattered here and there are CHILDREN'S TOYS. FINGER-PAINTINGS are taped to the walls. CANDLES are lit, and MUSIC is playing. \nJACK We're here! \nStephanie sails in. \nSTEPHANIE What happened to you guys? \nJACK Couple of wrong turns. (pointing a thumb at Miles) Thanks to Magellan, here. \nAfter a brief hug, Stephanie and Jack peck-kiss. \nJACK Hi. \nSTEPHANIE Hi. (to Miles) Maya's in the kitchen. \nMiles hesitates a moment before Jack elbows him toward -- \nEXT. STEPHANIE'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nMiles wanders in to find Maya squatting in front of a little temperature-controlled WINE STORAGE UNIT. \nMILES Hi. \nMAYA Hey. \nMILES She got anything good? \nMAYA Oh, yeah. Steph's way into Pinots and Syrahs. (calling out) Hey, Steph? You sure we can open anything? Anything we want? \nSTEPHANIE (V.O.) Anything but the Jayer Richebourg! \nMILES She has a Richebourg? Mon dieu. I have completely underestimated Stephanie. \nMAYA Who do you think you're dealing with here? \nMaya slips out a bottle of ESCHEVAUX. \nMAYA How about this? \nMiles nods vigorously. Maya looks back and forth between Miles and the wine, her eyes narrowed. Then she slides it back in. \nMAYA Nope. I don't think we know each other well enough. (picking out another bottle) I'd say this guy's more our speed. \nThey rise, and Miles glances at the ANDREW MURRAY SYRAH and, raising his eyebrows, agrees. Maya begins opening it. \nMAYA So what gems do you have in your collection? \nMILES Not much of a collection really. I haven't had the wallet for that, so I sort of live bottle to bottle. But I've got a couple things I'm saving. I guess the star would be a 1961 Cheval Blanc. \nMAYA You've got a '61 Cheval Blanc that's just sitting there? Go get it. (pushing him, playfully stern) Right now. Hurry up... \nMiles laughs, fights back a bit. \nMAYA Seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they? At least that's what I've read. \nMILES Yeah, I know. \nMAYA It might be too late already. What are you waiting for? \nMILES I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos... \nMAYA Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos. (sipping the wine) Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think? \nMILES My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good. \nMAYA Can I ask you a personal question? \nMILES (bracing himself) Sure. \nMAYA Why are you so into Pinot? It's like a thing with you. \nMiles laughs at first, then smiles wistfully at the question. He searches for the answer in his glass and begins slowly. \nMILES I don't know. It's a hard grape to grow. As you know. It's thin-skinned, temperamental, ripens early. It's not a survivor like Cabernet that can grow anywhere and thrive even when neglected. Pinot needs constant care and attention and in fact can only grow in specific little tucked- away corners of the world. And only the most patient and nurturing growers can do it really, can tap into Pinot's most fragile, delicate qualities. Only when someone has taken the time to truly understand its potential can Pinot be coaxed into its fullest expression. And when that happens, its flavors are the most haunting and brilliant and subtle and thrilling and ancient on the planet. \nMaya has found this answer revealing and moving. \nMILES I mean, Cabernets can be powerful and exalting, but they seem prosaic to me for some reason. By comparison. How about you? \nMAYA What about me? \nMILES I don't know. Why are you into wine? \nMAYA I suppose I got really into wine originally through my ex-husband. He had a big, kind of show-off cellar. But then I found out that I have a really sharp palate, and the more I drank, the more I liked what it made me think about. \nMILES Yeah? Like what? \nMAYA Like what a fraud he was. \nMiles laughs. \nMAYA No, but I do like to think about the life of wine, how it's a living thing. I like to think about what was going on the year the grapes were growing, how the sun was shining that summer or if it rained... what the weather was like. I think about all those people who tended and picked the grapes, and if it's an old wine, how many of them must be dead by now. I love how wine continues to evolve, how every time I open a bottle it's going to taste different than if I had opened it on any other day. Because a bottle of wine is actually alive -- it's constantly evolving and gaining complexity. That is, until it peaks -- like your '61 -- and begins its steady, inevitable decline. And it tastes so fucking good. \nNow it is Miles's turn to be swept away. Maya's face tells us the moment is right, but Miles remains frozen. He needs another sign, and Maya is bold enough to offer it: reaches out and places one hand atop his. \nMILES (pointing) Bathroom over there? \nMAYA Yeah. \nMiles gets up and walks out. Maya sighs and gets and American Spirit out of her purse. \nINT. STEPHANIE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT \nThe bathroom's a MESS -- the shower curtain is filthy, and the chipped and water-stained tub is filled with CHILDREN'S BATH TOYS. \nMiles is bent over the sink splashing water on his face, trying to sober up and gather his courage. He stands, and without drying his face, presses his palms against his cheeks. Then he takes a deep breath and drops his hands. \nMILES You are such a loser. Come on! \nINT. THE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nMiles comes out of the bathroom and looks for Maya, but she's not there. \nThen he hears a noise from the kitchen, so he goes through the door into -- \nINT. STEPHANIE'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nMaya is at the sink, filling a glass with water. \nMAYA I was just getting some water. You want some water? \nMiles goes to stand by her and accepts a glass of water. Just as she's about to fill a second glass, he stops her and looks her in the eye, trying to recapture a moment that is long gone. \nHe kisses her and she kisses back, but the whole thing feels strained and awkward. \nAfter a few seconds, Maya breaks away. \nMAYA Nice. \nBut instead of resuming the kiss, she steps past him, heading back into the living room. \nMAYA (O.S.) I should probably get going. \nMiles realizes he's blown it and silently berates himself. \nINT. SAAB - NIGHT \nMiles drives down the hill behind Maya's car, which leads him through this very rural road. \nEXT. WHERE THE ROAD MEETS THE HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nMaya's car comes to a stop just ahead of the Saab. She puts it in PARK and gets out. \nAT THE SAAB -- \nMiles rolls down his window as Maya leans over. \nMAYA You know how to get back to the Windmill, right? \nMILES Got it. \nMAYA I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did. \nMILES Good. So did I. \nMAYA Okay. See you around. \nMILES Um... did you still want to read my novel? \nMAYA Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course. \nNow Jack closes his eyes and brings the heel of his hand to his forehead as he begins to concoct the BIG LIE. \nJACK (opening his phone) Wait outside, will you? \nEXT. WINDMILL INN - DAY \nMiles wanders out and looks down at Stephanie. \nSTEPHANIE That was fun last night. \nMILES Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive. \nSTEPHANIE Thanks. Hey, I talked to Maya this morning. She said she had a good time too. You should call her. \nMiles says nothing. \nSTEPHANIE Where's Jack? \nMILES He had to make a phone call. \nStephanie cuts her bike's engine and climbs off, propping it up on the kickstand. \nSTEPHANIE So what are you up to today, Miles? \nMILES Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't know. Jack and I were supposed to go golfing. \nSTEPHANIE Huh. \nMILES Yeah, I reserved the tee time about a month ago. \nSTEPHANIE Oops. Sorry. \nMILES You golf? \nSTEPHANIE Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid game. I mean, at least, I could never get into it. I tried it once. \nMILES Huh. Jack loves golf. Crazy about it. \nJust then Jack cracks open the motel room door. \nJACK (hushed) Hey Miles. Miles. \nMiles ducks back inside. \nINT. MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nJACK Do you have that other condom? \nMiles reaches into his wallet and hands over the little foil square. \nMILES What'd Christine say? \nJACK Lucked out -- got voice mail. Everything's cool. \nEXT. WINDMILL INN - CONTINUOUS \nJack bounds out of the room and down the stairs like a child on Christmas morning. \nMiles watches Jack climb on the bike behind Stephanie, grasping her waist. \nStephanie and Jack PEEL OUT, leaving Miles alone on the balcony. \nCLOSE ON MILES -- \nAs we begin to hear a SNIPPING sound which carries us to -- \nEXT. MOTEL ROOM BALCONY - DAY \nMiles sits outside carefully trimming his toenails. SNIP, SNIP, SNIP. MUSIC BEGINS for this mournful montage of solitude. \nINT. MOTEL LOBBY - DAY \nMiles takes a styrofoam cup and helps himself to a cup of complimentary COFFEE from a PUMP THERMOS. \nThen he takes a look at the rack of pamphlets of local TOURIST ATTRACTIONS -- a water park, a mystery cave, and of course winery after winery. \nEXT. WINDMILL INN JACUZZI - DAY \nAmid turbulent water, Miles corrects his students' papers. He is alone in the tub, but at the nearby pool STOCKY KIDS play noisily with SUPER-SOAKERS. \nOVER MILES'S SHOULDER -- \nThe PAPER he's reading is marked up with circled spelling errors, and one entire paragraph has been crossed out. Finding a new error, Miles writes \"NO!!!\" \nCAMERA PANS to reveal a STACK of papers already heavily marked with corrections, some of them mottled with water stains. \nINT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY \nMiles FLOSSES, his lips pulled back into a grotesque moue. Then he brushes with a SONIC-CARE TOOTHBRUSH. \nLATER -- \nMiles checks his machine. \nSYNTHESIZED VOICE (O.S.) No new messages. \nHe hangs up, disgusted. \nEXT. CHINA PANDA RESTAURANT - DAY \nA small Buellton eatery. \nMILES Oh, you've been thinking. And? \nJACK I may have to put the wedding on hold is all. \nMiles looks at him with incredulity. \nJACK I fully realize that making a change like that might be tricky for certain people to accept at first, but life is short, Miles. I've got to be sure I'm doing the right thing before taking such a big step. And not just for my sake. I'm thinking about Christine's feelings too. I take marriage very seriously -- always have. That's why I've never done it before. The day I get married, it's going to be the real thing. \nMiles just looks at his friend, waiting for more. \nJACK Being with Stephanie has opened my eyes. She's not uptight or controlling. She's just cool. Things are so easy with her. Smells different. Tastes different. Fucks different. Fucks like an animal. I'm telling you, I went deep last night, Miles. Deep. \nMILES Deep. \nMiles draws a long sigh. \nJACK Don't get all judgmental on me. This is my deal. It's my life, and it's my call. \nThey fall silent for a moment. Then -- \nJACK I was hoping to get some understanding from you. And I'm not getting it. \nMILES Understanding of what? \nJACK Like I might be in love with another woman. \nMILES In love? Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer chick and you think you're in love? And give up everything? \nJACK Look who's talking. You've been there. \nMILES Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now? \nJACK This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married? \nMILES And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh? \nJACK (interrupting) Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even. \nMILES You're crazy. You've gone crazy. \nJACK What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine. \nMILES What? Of course I like Christine. \nJACK You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche. \nMILES That was three years ago after that first party! \nJACK Look, Miles, all I know is I'm an actor. All I have is my instinct. (his hand on his chest) My intuition -- that's all I have. And you're asking me to go against it. And that's just wrong. \nJust then Stephanie walks in. She cozies up to Jack, and he kisses the top of her head. \nSTEPHANIE Hi, guys. We should probably get going. \nMILES Where? \nINT. BOWLING ALLEY - DUSK \nCLOSE ON A VIDEO GAME MONITOR \nas a crazy car races through the obstacle-ridden track, often leaving the road, much like Jack's libido. \nZOOM OUT \nto reveal six-year-old SIENA seated in Jack's lap as they drive together. A delighted Siena laughs and giggles. \nMiles sits nearby with Stephanie and her fifty-something, two-pack-a-day MOTHER CARYL. \nCARYL Stephanie's heard this a thousand times, but if I'd done what I wanted and I'd bought up in Santa Maria when I had the chance, I would have made a fortune when they put in that outlet center and that Home Depot. (a drag off her cigarette, then to Stephanie) Your father knew it too, but he was a fucking chickenshit. Always was. \nCaryl looks over her shoulder, her gaze drawn to Jack and Siena, so completely happy together. \nCaryl exhales a puff of smoke as she watches. Stephanie is equally enthralled. Miles takes it all in, trying his best not to shake his head in disgust. \nINT. BOWLING ALLEY PARKING LOT - DUSK \nCaryl is behind the wheel of her OLDSMOBILE as Stephanie gets Siena buckled up in the backseat. Jack pulls Miles aside. \nJACK Listen, I'm going to make sure Steph and Siena get home safe, and then maybe we'll hook up with you later, okay? \nMILES (dispirited) Sure, whatever. Maybe I'll catch a movie. \nStephanie kisses Miles's cheek before getting in the car next to her mom. \nSTEPHANIE See you, Miles. You take care. \nMILES Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl. \nSIENA AND CARYL Bye, Miles. \nAs he gets in the car -- \nJACK Call me on my cell if you go out. \nMILES Yeah. \nMiles watches them drive away, then heads toward his Saab. \nINT. MINI-MART - DUSK \nCLOSE ON THE COUNTER -- \nMILES Nope. \nJACK She likes you, man. Stephanie'll tell you. \nMILES (preparing to swing) Can you give me some room here? \nJACK (stepping back) Oh yeah. Sure. \nMiles lifts his club. \nJACK You know, in life you gotta strike when the iron's hot. \nMILES Thanks, Jack. \nMiles refocuses and SWINGS just as Jack offers more helpful advice. \nJACK Don't whiff it. \nWHACK! Despite the distraction, Miles manages to make a good, long drive. \nJACK Nice shot. \nMILES You're an asshole. \nNOW ON THE FAIRWAY -- \nJack is pouring two Dixie cups of wine as Miles prepares to take his next swing. \nJACK What about your agent? Hear anything yet? \nMILES Nope. \nJACK What do you think's going on? \nMILES Could be anything. \nJACK Been checking your messages? \nMILES Obsessively. \nJACK Huh. \nMILES They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life. \nJACK But you don't know yet, so your negativity's a bit premature, wouldn't you say? \nMiles says nothing. \nJACK Or fuck those New York publishers. Publish it yourself. I'll chip in. Just get it out there, get it reviewed, get it in libraries. Let the public decide. \nGiving Jack a look that says Jack has no idea what he's talking about, Miles takes a stance over the ball and focuses. \nJACK Don't come over the top. Stay still. \nMILES Shut up. \nJACK Just trying to be helpful. (a moment later) It's all about stillness, Miles. Inner quiet. \nMiles drops his club and turns to Jack. \nMILES Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! What's the matter with you, man? SHUT UP! \nJACK Why are you so hostile? I know you're frustrated with your life right now, but you can choose not to be so hostile. (holding out a cup of wine) Here. \nStill fuming, Miles begrudgingly accepts the wine and has a taste. He's immediately distracted from his woes. \nMILES What is it? \nJACK I don't know. Got it from Stephanie. \nMiles downs the rest and is intrigued by the taste. \nMILES Huh. Let me see the label. \nSuddenly a golfball THUDS against the hard fairway directly behind them. \nJACK (whirling around) What the fuck? \nWay back on the tee box, some 200 yards away, are a FOURSOME of two couples. One of the MEN is waving his driver. \nHUSBAND #1 (shouting, barely audible) Hurry it up, will you? \nJack looks at Miles, the two incredulous. \nMILES Fucker hit into us. \nJACK (yelling) Hey, asshole! That's not cool! \nMILES Throw me his ball. \nJack walks over, picks up the offending ball and tosses it to Miles. Miles gets out his 3-wood and -- THWOCK! -- cuts it back low and hard. \nJACK Nice shot. \nTHE COUPLES \nduck for cover as the ball whistles over their heads. \nJACK AND MILES \nlaugh hard. \nEXT. IDYLLIC PICNIC SPOT - DAY INTO DUSK \nThe girls have led them to a beautiful spot. \nIN A SERIES OF SHOTS -- \nwe see the progress of their picnic. We don't hear them, but there is a growing intimacy about their interaction. Even Maya and Miles seem to be overcoming residual awkwardness from the other night. Jack and Stephanie lean on each other as they eat and sip wine. \nFinally, the two couples are SILHOUETTED against the SUNSET. \nEXT. WINERY #3 PARKING LOT - EVENING \nThe parking lot is crowded. The foursome join others headed toward the main building. \nINT. WINERY #3 - EVENING \nA LECTURE by British wine sage LESLIE BROUGH is in progress. He holds aloft a RIEDEL BURGUNDY GLASS containing one of the few but growing number of local reds worthy of his attention. \nIN THE AUDIENCE -- \nAs our foursome listen attentively, Jack leans over to Miles. \nJACK You ever actually read any of this guy's books? \nMILES He wrote a great one on Burgundy, and I used to get his newsletter, but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting. Plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century, and they turned out to be turkeys. Fucker never retracted. \nJACK Huh. \nStephanie leans forward and signals to Maya with a YAWN or a GAGGING FINGER IN MOUTH that they hightail it. Although Miles protests at first, they stand and leave. \nAT THE BACK OF THE ROOM -- \nStephanie finds a DOOR which she tests to see whether it is open. It is! She leads her pals furtively inside -- \nINT. WINEMAKING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nThis is an enormous, dimly-lit chamber filled with stainless steel FERMENTATION TANKS and stacks of OAK BARRELS. \nAs the two couples walk in the near-darkness, they are entranced. Maya takes Miles's hand and leads him away. \nLATER -- \nIn the background, Stephanie and Jack lean against a tank, kissing. \nCAMERA DOLLIES to reveal Miles and Maya among the barrels in the foreground. They are shy with each other, on the verge of kissing but holding back. \nTHE MUSIC CONTINUES... \nINT. STEPHANIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nTHREE BOTTLES OF WINE sit empty on the coffee table. \nWIDE -- \nThe four friends sit on the floor around the coffee table. They drink wine and pass a JOINT. Suddenly they explode in LAUGHTER. \nA sleepy Siena appears at the hallway door rubbing her eyes. Stephanie gets up, but Jack stops her, gathers Siena in his arms, and takes her back to bed. \nEXT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe Saab pulls away from the house. \nINT. SAAB - NIGHT \nMiles sits in his own passenger seat as Maya tries her hand at the Saab. \nEXT. MAYA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT \nMaya leads Miles up her back stairway. They're both a little woozy from the hours of drinking. \nAT THE DOOR -- \nMaya searches through her purse for her keys while Miles hovers directly behind her, staring at her ear. Her ear? \nJust as Maya puts the key in the lock, he impulsively leans forward to kiss the nape of her neck. Maya's reaction is immediate -- she turns to embrace Miles, giving him a long KISS. Then she opens the door, pulls him inside and closes the door in our face. \nThe camera PANS to the nearby ROOFTOPS. \nMUSIC ENDS AND SLOW DISSOLVE TO: \nTHE SAME VIEW BY DAY, SUPERIMPOSED WITH -- \nTHURSDAY \nThe CAMERA PANS back to Maya's door, tilting down to find a blue-wrapped NEW YORK TIMES. The door opens, and Maya's hand picks up the newspaper. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Maya inside to -- \nINT. MAYA'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS \nIt is a small, clean apartment furnished with simple taste. \nMaya is dressed in a ROBE and holds a COFFEE MUG. She drops the paper on the dining table and continues into -- \nTHE BEDROOM -- \nwhere Miles lies on his stomach DEAD TO THE WORLD. His stubbly face is squished against the mattress and he SNORES lightly. \nMaya looks at him for a moment before shaking his foot. \nEXT. FARMERS' MARKET - DAY \nThis is a weekly event in a big PARKING LOT -- organic produce, candles and incense, honey and cider. \nJACK What? \nMILES It's private. \nJACK You're kidding, right? Tell me what happened, you fucker, or I'll tie your dick in a knot. \nMILES Let's leave it alone. \nJack looks at Miles, his face frozen with incomprehension. \nJACK You didn't get any, did you? (off Miles's silence) You're a homo. \nMILES Just stop, okay? Make something up, and that's what happened. Whatever you want. Write my confession, and I'll sign it. Just stop pushing me all the time! I can't take it! You're an infant! This is all a big party for you, but not for me! This is serious. And you -- Just... leave me alone, okay? You're fucking me up. \nJACK Wow. Okay. Calm down. Sorry. \nMiles begins to calm down. Jack grows concerned and sensitively puts one arm around his friend. \nJACK Did you have trouble performing? Yeah, that's... \nMILES Shut up! Shut up, Jack! \nThe phone RINGS and both men look at it, silenced by the ominous sound. \nMILES Don't answer it. \nBut Jack is drawn to it as though enticed by a strange game of Russian roulette. \nMILES I'm telling you, don't. \nJack picks up the receiver and puts it to his ear. \nJACK Hello? Oh, hey, honey. How you doing? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. (mouthing) Christine. \nMiles lies on his bed and clamps both hands over his ears. His face is dark with resentment. \nJACK Listen, honey. Let me call you back. Miles and I are in the middle of something. No, it's nothing serious -- Miles is just having one of his freak- outs. Yeah. Love you too. I'll call you right back. \nJack hangs up. \nMILES This whole week has gone sour. It isn't turning out like it was supposed to. (deadly serious) I want to go home. \nJACK Who's being selfish now? I'm the one getting married. I thought this week was supposed to be about me. \nMILES We gotta slow down. (closing his eyes) I'm so tired. Let's just get out of here. \nJACK I know what you need. \nINT. SEARS - DAY \nJack watches Miles be fitted for SNEAKERS. A SALES ASSOCIATE ties Miles's laces. \nSALES ASSOCIATE There you go. \nMiles gets up and walks in a circle. \nMILES Do you like them? \nJACK Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty. \nMILES Are they too sporty? \nINT. MALL - DAY \nThe boys exit Sears, Miles wearing his new shoes and carrying a PLASTIC BAG with a string handle. \nJACK Feel better? \nMiles shrugs. \nJACK (noticing something) Oh here, wait a second. I want to run in here real quick. \nHe heads toward a TOYS STORE. \nJACK (over his shoulder) I want to get something for Siena. \nMildly concerned, Miles watches Jack go into the store. \nINT./EXT. SAAB - DAY \nMiles is slumped in the passenger seat as Jack drives. They pass a BIG COMMERCIAL WINERY. Jack slows down, preparing to turn in. \nJACK How about this one? We didn't hit this one. \nMILES Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke. \nJACK You ever actually been in there, Miles? \nMILES I don't have to. \nJACK (turning the wheel) I say we check it out. You never know. \nEXT. LARGE WINERY PARKING LOT - DAY \nThe Saab finds a place in the large parking lot. A TOUR BUS, whose flank reads \"Solvang Wine Tours,\" is in the process of letting out WINE TOURISTS, many of them elderly. \nINT. LARGE WINERY - DAY \nThe room boasts not only a large TASTING BAR but also display after display of t-shirts, golf shirts, olive oils, chocolate sauces and other gourmet tourist items emblazoned with the winery's logo. \nIn the corner an ACOUSTIC GUITARIST with a small amp plays soothing Windham Hill-ish music. \nThe pourer signals to a SECURITY GUY at the door. Across the room Jack notices the disturbance and heads over. \nMiles hoists up the SPIT BUCKET, holds it aloft and starts to GUZZLE it. Wine cascades down the sides of his face, onto his shirt and even onto his shiny new shoes. \nThe Security Guy yanks the bucket away from Miles, and drags him toward the EXIT. Jack catches up. \nJACK (to the horrified onlookers) It's all right. His mother just died. \nEXT. BEACH - DAY \nTwo PELICANS soar low over the water. One of the DIVES, crashing into the water and disappearing from view. \nJack and Miles sit on the hood of the Saab, gazing at the ocean, sharing a bottle of wine. \nJACK Just write another one. You have lots of ideas, right? \nMILES No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer. I'm a middle-school English teacher. I'm going to spend the rest of my life grading essays and reading the works of others. It's okay. I like books. The world doesn't give a shit what I have to say. I'm unnecessary. (a dark laugh) I'm so insignificant, I can't even kill myself. \nJACK What's that supposed to mean? \nMILES You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published. \nJACK What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces? He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is. \nMILES Thanks. \nJACK Don't give up. You're going to make it. \nMILES Half my life is over, and I have nothing to show for it. I'm a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage. \nJACK See? Right there. Just what you just said. That's beautiful. A thumbprint on a skyscraper. I couldn't write that. \nMILES Neither could I. I think it's Bukowski. \nUnable to respond, Jack looks up and down the beach. \nEXT. BUCOLIC ROAD - DAY \nZOOM! There goes the Saab. \nThe CAMERA lingers behind and PANS to reveal THE DEAD DOG, now covered with FLIES AND MAGGOTS. \nEXT. WINDMILL INN - DAY \nJack and Miles pull into the parking lot. \nJACK (lighting up) Oh, look. There's Steph! \nHe smiles broadly and honks his horn. Miles turns to see -- \nSTEPHANIE \nseated halfway up on the motel stairs, her HELMET in her lap, watching patiently as -- \nTHE SAAB \npulls to a stop in a parking space. \nMiles masks his concern as he gets out of the car and reaches in the backseat for his Sears bag. \nJACK (calling out) Hey, baby. \nStephanie stands up and slowly descends the steps, as Jack reaches into the trunk and pulls out a BIG CUDDLY LION DOLL. \nJACK Look what I got for our favorite girl. \nStephanie walks toward Jack as he waddles toward her hugging the lion. When they get close, Stephanie's face transforms with rage. \nSTEPHANIE YOU MOTHERFUCKER! \nShe swings her helmet and HITS JACK FULL IN THE FACE. \nJack falls, blood spraying out of his nose. Stephanie stands over him and continues to BEAT HIM with her helmet as he rolls back and forth, protecting his head with the stuffed lion. \nMiles ineffectually attempts to stop her, dancing just out of range. \nMILES Stephanie! Stop! \nSTEPHANIE You fucking bastard! Lying piece of shit! You're getting married on Saturday? What was all that shit you said to me? \nJACK I can explain. \nSTEPHANIE You said you loved me! You fuck! I hope you die! \nWith that she backs away. Glancing at her bloodied helmet, she tosses it onto the pavement before getting on her bike. \nSTEPHANIE Fuckface! (to Miles) You too! \nAs she speeds away, Miles is left to comfort his wounded friend. The lion lies nearby, staring blankly at the sky. \nINT./EXT. SAAB - DAY \nSeated in the passenger seat and in great agony, Jack presses a BLOOD-SOAKED TOWEL against his face. \nMILES Aren't you glad you didn't move up here and marry her? \nJACK Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you? \nMILES No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night. \nJACK You told him. I'm fucking hurting here. \nMILES creeps over, sticks his hand into the open space and pulls back the curtain to reveal -- \nA LIVING ROOM the is hideously MESSY. Draped over a deformed beanbag chair are JACK'S LEVI'S. \nMiles gathers his courage, carefully slides open the glass door, and creeps inside. \nINT. CAMMI'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nA furtive search of Jack's pockets reveals NOTHING. Then Miles notices a HIGH-PITCHED SOUND wafting from an open door down a short HALLWAY. \nMiles feverishly begins foraging through the debris on the floor. Again nothing. Meanwhile the noise from the bedroom grows louder -- female MOANING in odd rhythmic unison with a MAN'S VOICE. \nIN THE HALLWAY -- \nMiles gets on ALL FOURS and starts crawling, weaving his way through a trail of shoes and clothes. \nNearing the open door, the sounds grow more distinct -- \nMAN You don't think I fuck you, bitch? I'll fuck you. \nCAMMI I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl. \nMiles peers around the corner of the open door to see -- \nINT. CAMMI'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nCammi is TIED to the faux brass headboard. A BIG GUY slams away at her. In the corner a soundless TV shows a PRESIDENTIAL PRESS CONFERENCE. \nMAN You picked him up and you fucked him, didn't you, bitch? \nCAMMI I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl. \nMAN And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore? \nCAMMI I liked it when you caught me fucking him. \nWhoa! \nMiles manages to tear his eyes away from this nature documentary and scan the room. \nIRIS IN -- \nto the WALLET atop the dresser. \nMiles's eyes dart back and forth between the couple and the wallet. His HEART BEATING LOUDLY, he goes for it. He scrambles to his feet, dashes across the room, seizes the wallet and tears out. Behind him he hears -- \nMAN (O.S.) The fuck was that? \nCAMMI (O.S.) The wallet! He took Derek's wallet! \nEXT. CAMMI'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nMiles comes flying out of the sliding glass door, followed swiftly by the man, who is of course STARK NAKED. And he's fast for a man his size. \nCAMMI (O.S.) Get him! \nINT. SAAB - MORNING \nJack is reclined in the passenger seat FAST ASLEEP. On the radio NPR'S CARL KASSEL reads the news. \nTHROUGH THE DRIVER'S WINDOW -- \nMiles comes sprinting towards us, mere steps ahead of Cammi's naked husband. Finding the car door locked, Miles knocks loudly on the glass, startling Jack awake. \nMILES Open up! Jesus! Open the goddamn door! \nJack flips the electric locks just in time for Miles to get in before -- \nWHUMP! The guy's BELLY hits the window. He pounds on the roof before trying the door, now re-locked. \nMAN You motherfuckers! I'll kill you! I'll kill you motherfuckers! \nMiles starts the car and begins to drive away. The guy tries to keep up but can't, running barefoot on asphalt. Jack turns to look -- \nOUT THE BACK WINDOW -- \nThe guy recedes in the distance. \nJACK \nremoves the rings from the wallet. \nJACK You did it! You fucking did it! \nThey LAUGH and SLAP HANDS. \nCLOSE ON MILES -- \nFor all his failures, this time he did something right. \nINT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY \nThe shades are drawn. Jack is CRASHED OUT on the bed, snoring loudly. Miles folds his shirts and trousers -- readying his bags for departure. \nAt one moment he stops and watches his friend sleep. \nA KNOCK at the door. Miles goes to answer it, but once his hand is on the knob, he pauses. If we're perceptive, we will know he's hoping against hope that it's Maya. \nHe opens it. It's just the MAID with her big CART. \nMAID Housekeeping. \nMiles waves his hand in a gesture of \"Get it over with.\" \nGrunting with effort, Jack leans inside the car and drops the foundation block onto the GAS PEDAL. \nDirect hit! Jack leaps backward and hits the dirt just in time. \nMiles and Jack watch the driverless Saab race toward the tree, its speed increasing. But just before hitting it, the car drifts to one side and SAILS RIGHT PAST. \nMILES Oh, fuck! \nThe car zooms wildly across the vacant lot and, missing the tree, continues on until CRASHING THROUGH A FENCE and finally toppling headlong into a CEMENT TRENCH. Only the back of the car remains visible. \nThe whole thing is finished in a matter of seconds. Still frozen in place, Miles and Jack turn slowly to each other. \nJACK It's okay. I've got Triple A. \nEXT. 101 FREEWAY - DAY \nFrom in front of the Saab, we see its now CRUMPLED HOOD and FENDER, a couple of BUNGEE CORDS holding the whole thing together. \nEXT. PALOS VERDES STREET - DAY \nThe Saab approaches the end of the line. \nEXT. ERGANIAN HOUSE --DAY \nAT THE FRONT PORCH -- \nMiles has helped Jack carry his bags and the wine. He plops the last case down. \nMILES Well. That about does it. \nJACK Why don't you come in? \nMILES Uh-uh. You're on your own. \nJACK So I'll see you at the rehearsal. \nMILES Yeah. \nThey give each other a brief manly back-slappy hug. \nJACK Love you, man. \nMILES Back at you. \nMiles heads toward the curb. \nJACK Hey, don't pull away till they see the car. \nMILES (over his shoulder) Yeah. (turning around) Hey, why wasn't I injured? \nJACK (big smile) You were wearing your belt. \nBACK AT HIS CAR -- \nMiles gets in and watches through the side window as Mrs. Erganian opens the front door and welcomes Jack with shock and dismay. Jack points back at -- \nMILES raising one hand in a feeble wave. The camera slowly MOVES CLOSER as he continues to watch -- \nJACK -- \nweaving his story of woe. He's a great actor when he wants to be. Mr. Erganian and a mortified Christine come to the door too. Mr. Erganian takes a few steps toward the car to get a better look. \nVERY CLOSE ON MILES -- \nwatching the drama play out. Then his eyes drop as he momentarily loses himself in melancholy. This reverie is interrupted by -- \nTHE VOICE OF AN ARMENIAN PRIEST \nStartled, Miles turns to look at -- \nA PRIEST \nwho is singing the BLESSING OF THE RINGS. \nWe are now in -- \nINT. ARMENIAN APOSTOLIC CHURCH - DAY \nThe church is packed. \nCLOSE ON THE RINGS as the priest holds them aloft. \nIf those rings could talk... Jack shoots a quick look at Miles, who looks right back. The priest continues his blessing. \nEXT. ARMENIAN CHURCH - DAY \nAT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS -- \nThe WEDDING FAMILIES greet the exiting guests in a RECEIVING LINE. Smiling and exuberant, Jack seems utterly at home as the new groom. \nAT THE BOTTOM OF THE STEPS -- \nMiles watches the scene, not without melancholy. Then -- \nVICTORIA (O.S.) Hey, Miles. \nMiles turns and looks up to see Victoria, standing one step above him. Just behind her is her NEW HUSBAND. He exudes the quiet confidence of a successful businessman who played college football, takes expensive skiing and sailing vacations, and hasn't read a novel since high school. \nMILES Hi, Vicki. (taking her in) You look beautiful. \n", "test1_input": "\"SIDEWAYS\" \nScreenplay by \nAlexander Payne & Jim Taylor \nBased on the novel by \nRex Pickett \nMay 29, 2003 \nUNDER THE STUDIO LOGO: \nKNOCKING at a door and distant dog BARKING. \nNOW UNDER BLACK, a CARD -- \nSATURDAY \nThe rapping, at first tentative and polite, grows insistent. Then we hear someone get out of bed. \nMILES (O.S.) ...the fuck... \nA DOOR is opened, and the black gives way to BLINDING WHITE LIGHT, the way one experiences the first glimpse of day amid, say, a hangover. \nA WORKER is there. \nMILES (O.S.) Yeah? \nWORKER Hi, Miles. Can you move your car, please? \nMILES (O.S.) Why? \nWORKER The painters got to put the truck in, and you didn't park too good. \nMILES (O.S.) (a sigh, then --) Yeah, hold on. \nHe closes the door with a SLAM. \nEXT. MILES'S APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY \nSUPERIMPOSE -- \nSAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA \nWearing only underwear, a bathrobe and clogs, MILES RAYMOND comes out of his unit and heads toward the street. He passes some SIX MEXICANS waiting to work. \nHe climbs into his twelve-year-old CONVERTIBLE SAAB, parked far from the curb and blocking part of the driveway. The car starts fitfully. \nAs he pulls away, the guys begin backing up the truck. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nMiles rounds the corner and finds a new parking spot. \nINT. CAR - CONTINUOUS \nHe cuts the engine, exhales a long breath and brings his hands to his head in a gesture of headache pain or just anguish. He leans back in his seat, closes his eyes, and soon NODS OFF. \nINT. MILES'S APARTMENT - DAY \nThe door bursts open. Miles runs into the kitchen, looking just past camera. \nMILES Fuck! \nWHIP PAN TO -- \nTHE MICROWAVE CLOCK that reads 10:50. \nON THE PHONE -- \nMiles hurriedly throws clothes into a suitcase. \nMILES Yeah, no, I know I said I'd be there by noon, but there's been all this work going on at my building, and it's like a total nightmare, and I had a bunch of stuff to deal with this morning. But I'm on my way. I'm out the door right this second. It's going to be great. Yeah. Bye. \nINT. MILES'S BATHROOM - DAY \nON THE TOILET -- \nMiles has a BOOK propped open on his knees. He turns a page, lost in his reading. \nLATER -- \nMiles SHOWERS. \nIN THE MIRROR -- \nMiles FLOSSES. \nINT. COFFEE HOUSE - DAY \nMiles finally makes it to the front of the line. \nBARISTA Hey, Miles. \nMILES Hey, Simon. Triple espresso, please. \nBARISTA Rough night, huh?

PALOS VERDES STREET - DAY \nThe houses on this block are blandly palatial as in so many affluent Southern California suburbs. \nMiles's car pull into the driveway behind an older BMW and two LEXI. He gets out and trots toward the front door. \nINT. ERGANIAN HOUSE - DAY \nA GIANT PROJECTION TV -- \nIn a large split-level living room displays a GOLF TOURNAMENT. \nWIDE -- \nWatching from the ultra-comfortable furniture are MIKE ERGANIAN, a tanned, silver-haired real estate caudillo; bride- to-be CHRISTINE ERGANIAN, his oldest daughter; and JACK LOPATE, wearing bowling shirt, shorts and flip-flops. \nMRS. ERGANIAN, a warm and elegant housewife, shows Miles into the room. \nMRS. ERGANIAN Look what the cat dragged! \nMILES Hi, everybody. \nMr. Erganian and Jack get to their feet and shake hands with Miles. Jack remains affable, but we can discern his genuine irritation. \nJACK About time you got here, bud. Mr. Prompt. \nMR. ERGANIAN We were thinking maybe you took the wrong way and went to Tijuana and they didn't let you back in. \nThe Erganians laugh. Miles works up a smile too. \nMILES I had to bribe them. \nMore lame laughter. \nCHRISTINE Hey, Miles. \nMILES (leaning in to kiss Christine) Seriously though, the freeway was unbelievable today. Unbelievable. Bumper to bumper the whole way. People getting an early start on the weekend, I guess. Granted I got a late start, but still. \nAlthough Mr. Erganian presses MUTE on the remote, he keeps watching for an extended moment, as do Jack and Miles. \nMRS. ERGANIAN Christine, why don't you ask Miles about the cake? \nCHRISTINE Oh, good idea. Here, Miles, come to the kitchen with me. \nJACK Don't bother him with that. We got to get going. \nCHRISTINE (taking Miles's hand) It'll just take a second. \nINT. ERGANIAN KITCHEN - DAY \nJack and the Erganians surround Miles as he eats from a plate with two pieces of CAKE -- one white, one dark. \nMRS. ERGANIAN Jack tells us you are publishing a book. Congratulations. \nMR. ERGANIAN Yes, congratulations. \nMiles shoots Jack a look. Mr. Erganian gets some ice cubes from the refrigerator door. \nMILES Yeah, well, it's not exactly finalized yet, but, um, there has been some interest and -- \nMRS. ERGANIAN (to Jack) Your friend is modest. \nJACK Yeah, Miles, don't be so modest. Indulge them. Don't make me out to be a liar. \nMR. ERGANIAN What subject is your book? Non- fiction? \nMILES No, it's a novel. Fiction. Although there's a lot from my own life, so I guess technically some of it is non- fiction. \nMR. ERGANIAN Good, I like non-fiction. There is so much to know about the world that I think reading a story someone just invented is kind of a waste of time. \nCHRISTINE So which one do you like better? \nMILES I like them both, but if pressed I'd have to say I prefer the dark. \nJACK (to Christine) See? \nINT.

Then -- \nMILES I hate Tony Levin. \nJack swirls his wine and downs it in one gulp. Just then -- \nMAYA \nWalks into the bar and takes a seat a few stools down. She has changed into a black cashmere sweater and corduroys, lovely but tired. \nMAYA (to Gary) Highliner, please. \nJACK That's on us. \nMaya looks over and smiles as Gary pours her a glass from their bottle. \nMAYA Hey, guys. \nMaya gets an American Spirit Yellow out of her purse and lights it while Gary pours her a glass. \nMILES You want to join us? \nMAYA (polite) Sure. \nIn no hurry, she takes a long sip of her wine, gets up and comes down the bar. \nMAYA So how's that book of yours going, Miles? I think you were almost done with it last time we talked. \nMILES I finished it. \nMAYA Good for you. \nJACK It's getting published. That's what we're up here celebrating. \nMiles shoots Jack a look. Jack responds with a \"don't-fuck- it-up-brother\" glower. \nMAYA That's fantastic. Congratulations. \nShe offers her glass, and all clink. \nMAYA (to Jack) Are you a writer too? \nJACK No, I'm an actor. \nMAYA Oh yeah? What kind of stuff? \nJACK A lot of TV. I was a regular on a couple of series. And lately I've been doing a lot of commercials. National mostly. \nMAYA Anything I'd know? \nJACK Maybe. Recognize this? \nJack takes a deep breath, and out comes a perfect VOICE-OVER VOICE. \nJACK \"Now with low, low 5.8% APR financing.\" \nMaya's mouth drops open and curves into a big smile. \nMAYA That's hilarious. You sound just like one of those guys. \nJACK I am one of those guys. \nMAYA You are not. \nMILES He is. \nJack launches into another one of his sure-fire hits. \nJACK (very fast) Consult your doctor before using this product. Side effects may include oily discharge, dizziness, hives, loss of appetite, difficulty breathing and low blood pressure. If you have diabetes or a history of kidney trouble... you're fucked! \nThis makes Maya laugh a big throaty laugh. Jack joins in. Nervous about Jack's aggressive flirtatiousness, Miles musters a tight courtesy smile. \nMAYA (winding down) Oh. I needed that. Thank you. \nThey all take a drink of wine. \nMAYA So what are you guys up to tonight? \nBefore Jack has a chance to speak -- \nMILES We're pretty wiped. Probably go back to the hotel and crash. \nThis makes Maya slightly embarrassed at her apparent availability, but she recovers quickly, remains breezy. \nMAYA Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying? \nMILES The Windmill. \nJACK Windmill. \nMaya downs the rest of her wine, stamps out her smoke, and picks up her jean jacket and purse. \nMAYA Well, good to see you, Miles.

She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published. \nMILES Now I've got another lie to live down. Thanks, Jack. \nJACK I'm trying to get you some action, but you've got to help me out just a little bit. \nMILES Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on. You were all over her. \nJACK Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married. \nMILES How do you know? \nJACK No rock. When she came to the bar, sans rock. \nINT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nThe screen is absolutely BLACK. \nJACK Single. Waitress. Getting off work. Looking for love. A little slap and tickle. \nMILES Shut up. \nJACK She probably went home, lit some candles, put on some relaxing music, took a nice hot bath, and laid down on her bed with her favorite vibrator. \nJack begins to make a soft BUZZING noise, growing gradually louder and more rhythmic. \nMILES Have you no shame? \nJACK Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles. \nMILES Fuck you. \nThere's now a rustling noise and footsteps. Then a LIGHT is flipped on in the BATHROOM. \nMiles closes the door behind him, and the only light visible is at the bottom of the bathroom door. \nMiles PEES -- a series of semi-forced SHORT SQUIRTS. Then a FLUSH as a door opens and the light goes off. Jack starts BUZZING again. \nMILES Shut the fuck up! \nJack stops and Miles climbs into bed. Silence.

For some reason Jack is humorless and grumpy. \nMILES So what're we going to have? Pigs in a blanket? The \"rancher's special breakfast\"? Or maybe just some grease and fat with a side of lard? \nJACK (not amused) So what's the plan today? \nMILES We head north, begin the grape tour up there, make our way south so the more we drink the closer we get to the motel. \nJack sarcastically taps an index finger to his temple. \nMILES What's your problem? \nJack exhales and looks away, as though he doesn't want to get into it. \nMILES What is it? \nJack sucks his teeth a moment searching for the right words. Then the dam bursts. \nJACK I am going to get my nut on this trip, Miles. And you are not going to fuck it up for me with all your depression and anxiety and neg-head downer shit. \nMILES Ooooh, now the cards are on the table. \nJACK Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do not fuck with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday. Do you read me? \nMILES Sure, big guy. Whatever you say. It's your party. I'm sorry I'm in the way and dragging you down. Maybe you'd have a better time on your own. You take the car. I'll catch the train back. \nJACK No, see, I want both of us to get crazy. We should both be cutting loose. I mean, this is our last chance. This is our week! It should be something we share. \nThe older WAITRESS comes over. \nWAITRESS Can I take your order? \nJACK But I am warning you. \nMILES Oatmeal, one poached egg, and rye toast.

You know, the grateful type. \nMILES I don't know. I wouldn't know. \nNow she comes back toward the table carrying a BIG BASKET. Beneath the hideous uniform, her nylons SH-SH-SH as she walks. When she arrives, she replenishes their corn bread basket using big TONGS. Jack watches attentively. \nJACK Nice technique there... (checking her name tag) ...Cammi. \nCAMMI It's all in the wrist. (a moment later) You know, you look really familiar. You from around here? Where'd you go to high school? \nJACK No, we're from San Diego. Why? \nCAMMI I don't know. You just seem really familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy your meals. \nJACK Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby? \nCAMMI Doctor Derek Sommersby? You mean from \"One Life to Live\"? \nMiles looks away and sighs. \nJACK You have to imagine him with a bandage and shorter hair. \nAs Cammi stares at Jack, her face transforms in astonishment. \nCAMMI No. Way. No way! \nJack smiles and nods. \nCAMMI Oh, my God! \nMILES Could you tell me where the bathroom is? \nCAMMI (her eyes barely leaving Jack) Uh, sure, it's right over there, right past the buffalo. \nIN A WIDE SHOT -- \nMiles gets up and heads toward the bathroom as Jack's flirtation with Cammi continues. \nThe camera PANS with Miles as he walks by us and goes through the bathroom door, which closes behind him, filling the frame with the word \"MEN.\" \nLATER -- \nA TOOTHPICK DISPENSER as a finger tips it forward to dispense one. \nWIDER -- \nMiles stands by the cash register and PICKS HIS TEETH as he watches Jack finish speaking with Cammi and head his way. \nJACK She gets off in an hour, so I think I'm just going to have a drink and then... make sure she gets home safe. \nMILES You're joking, right? (seeing that he isn't) What are you doing? Un-fucking- believeable. Can we just go back to the hotel and hang out and get up early and play nine holes before we head home? \nJack rests one hand on Miles's shoulder and drops his head, thinking how best to put it. \nJACK Look, Miles. I know you're my friend and you care about me. And I know you disapprove. I respect that. But there are some things I have to do that you don't understand. You understand wine and literature and movies, but you don't understand my plight.

At one point I had to cut through an ostrich farm. Fuckers are mean. \nMiles has now awakened to take in the absurdity of the whole scene, and he LAUGHS HARD. The blanketed bulge just sits there. Finally it looks up and shows its pitiful visage. \nJACK We gotta go back. \nMILES What? \nJACK I left my wallet. My credit cards, cash, fucking ID, everything. We gotta go back. \nMILES Big deal. We'll call right now and cancel your cards. \nJACK You don't understand. The wedding bands. The wedding bands are in my wallet. \nMILES Okay, so they were in your wallet, and you left your wallet somewhere. Some bar. Christine'll understand. \nJACK No. She ordered them special. Took her forever to find them. They've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in Sanskrit. We've got to go back. Christine'll fucking crucify me. \nMILES No way. No way. \nJACK (a pitiful whine) Please, Miles, please. \nMILES Forget it. Your wallet was stolen at a bar.

We've got to get them, Miles! I fucked up! I know I fucked up, okay? I fucked up. You gotta help me. You gotta help me. Pleeeease! \nJack now descends to a level of wretchedness and desperation that Miles has never seen before in Jack, or in anyone else for that matter. \nJACK Oh, God, please... Oh God. I know I'm bad. I know I did a bad thing. Help me, Miles. Just this one thing, this one last thing. I can't lose Christine. I can't. I'm nothing without her. Please, Miles, please... uuuuu... uuuuuu.... uuuuuuu...... \nNo longer able to form words, Jack is reduced to emitting low, primitive sounds. Snot flows from beneath his bandaged nose. \nINT./EXT.

{"test1_input": "Approaching the front door, Miles pulls a BOUQUET OF FLOWERS out of a plastic grocery store bag. Jack carries a bottle of CHAMPAGNE. \nMiles pulls a BIRTHDAY CARD out of the bag too. \nMILES Wait a second. \nHe pulls a PEN from his pocket and signs it. As he licks the envelope, Jack rings the bell. \nMoments later PHYLLIS comes to the door. She is a matronly older woman in a nightgown and housecoat. \nMILES AND JACK Surprise! Happy Birthday! \nThe boys offer up the flowers and champagne. Phyllis slurs slightly as she speaks -- she's been doing some celebrating of her own. \nPHYLLIS My God. Miles. And Jack! What a surprise. I can't remember the last time you brought me flowers. \nThey hug. \nJACK They're from both of us. \nPHYLLIS A famous actor bringing me flowers on my birthday. Don't I feel special? \nMILES A famous actor who's getting married next week. \nPHYLLIS Oh, that's right. Isn't that nice? I hope that girls knows how lucky she is, marrying no less than Derek Summersby. \nThe boys follow her inside. \nINT. MILES'S MOTHER'S CONDO - CONTINUOUS \nJACK Jeez, Mrs. Raymond, that was eleven years ago. \nPHYLLIS Well, you were wonderful on that show. I never understood why they had to give you that brain tumor so soon. Why that didn't make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin. It's a sin. \nJACK Yeah, well, you should be my agent. \nPHYLLIS If I was, I would sing your praises up and down the street until they put me in the loony bin. Now Miles, why didn't you tell me you were coming and bringing this handsome man? Look how I'm dressed. I've got to run and put my face on. \nJACK You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond. \nPHYLLIS (over her shoulder) Oh, stop it. Make yourselves comfortable. (now around the corner) You boys hungry? \nMILES Yeah, I'm hungry. \nJack gives Miles a look. \nMILES (low) Just a snack. Calm down. \nMiles leads Jack into this small condo. The TV is on, and it's MESSY. Amid the newspapers and junk mail and dishes, an AB-ROLLER and an ancient SCHWINN EXER-CYCLE sit forgotten in a corner. \nINT. MILES'S MOTHER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT \nMiles finishes twisting ice trays into a MOP BUCKET as it fills with water in the sink. He puts the champagne in and carries it into the -- \nINT. MILES'S MOTHER'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nHe takes a seat on the sofa next to Jack, who is watching WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE? \nMILES Let me show you something. The secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released, you keep pressure on it so you don't -- \nJACK (concentrated on the TV) Just a second. Guy's going for $2500. \nMiles finishes opening the bottle with an elegant silence. \nPHYLLIS (O.S.) Ready for my close up! \nThe boys turn to see Phyllis now dolled up in thick make-up and a PANTSUIT. Her eyebrows are painted and cock-eyed. Overall she looks much worse than before. \nPHYLLIS Oh, champagne! Miles, why don't you bring that out onto the lanai? I thought we could eat on the lanai. \nEXT. MILES'S MOTHER'S LANAI - NIGHT \nMiles and Jack are seated in webbed chairs around a circular glass table. They are mid-meal. \nEveryone is more than a little lubricated, especially the birthday girl as she returns from the kitchen with another plate of food. \nJACK Mrs. Raymond, this is delicious. Absolutely delicious. \nPHYLLIS (sitting) They're just leftovers. \nJACK Is it chicken? \nPHYLLIS I could have made something fancier if a certain someone had let me know that a certain someone was coming for a visit with a certain special friend. Could have made a pork roast. \nMILES It was a surprise, Mom. \nPHYLLIS And I could have already put clean sheets on the other bed and the fold- out. You are staying. Wendy, Ron and the twins are picking us up at 11:30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton. They do a magnificent job there. Wendy is so excited you're coming. \nSilence. Jack freezes, his fork halfway to his mouth. \nMILES You talked to Wendy? \nPHYLLIS Just now. She's thrilled. And the kids. \nMILES (trying to be chipper) Yeah, well. You know, Jack's pretty eager to get up to... you know, but, uh, yeah. We'll see how it goes. \nPHYLLIS Well, you boys do what you want. I just think it would be nice for us to be together as a family on my birthday. \nMILES Uh-huh. (wiping his mouth) I'll be right back. \nHe gets up and heads into the house. \n", "test1_true": "Miles heads toward... \nINT. MILES'S APARTMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT \n...and goes directly to her dresser, opening a drawer filled with bras, panties and stockings. \nHe burrows through his mother's lingerie until locating a CAN OF RAID. A can of Raid? \nHe twists open the bottom and pulls it apart, revealing it to be a SECRET STASH for valuables disguised as a common household product. Inside are stacks of ONE-HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS. \nMILES (quickly peeling some off) ...six, seven, eight,... (one more for good luck) Nine. \nHis task complete, he closes the drawer, and as he stuffs the bills in his pocket, his glance falls upon FRAMED PHOTOS atop the dresser -- \n-- A proud NINE-YEAR-OLD MILES poses in front of his childhood San Diego home, showing off a WAGON filled with freshly harvested lettuce. On the wagon is a hand-lettered sign -- \"10 cents a bunch.\" \n-- A Sears portrait shows the RAYMOND FAMILY: a much younger Phyllis, her husband, and their two children -- a 12-year- old Miles and seven-year-old Wendy. \n-- Miles at his wedding. He and his bride VICTORIA look young and attractive, their faces radiant and hopeful. \nINT. MILES'S APARTMENT BATHROOM - NIGHT \nMiles enters, flushes the toilet and leaves. \nEXT. MILES'S MOTHER'S LANAI - NIGHT \nAs Miles slides open the door and takes his seat again, Jack is pouring Phyllis another glass. \nPHYLLIS And what was that other one you did, the one where you're the jogger? \nJACK Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash. \nPHYLLIS Spray and Wash. That's the one. \nJACK Yeah, I remember the girl who was in it with me. She was something. \nPHYLLIS I just remember you jogging. So when's the wedding? \nMILES (irritated) This Saturday, Mom, remember? We told you. \nJACK And Miles is my best man, Mrs. Raymond. My main man. \nPHYLLIS (another drink of wine) Miles, when are you going to get married again? \nMILES I just got divorced. Phyllis. \nJACK Two years ago, buddy. \nPHYLLIS You should get back together with Victoria. She was good for you. \nEmbarrassed for his friend, Jack just stares at his food. \nPHYLLIS She was good for you. (turning to Jack) And so beautiful and intelligent. You knew her, right? \nJACK Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do. \nPHYLLIS I'm worried about you, Miles. Do you need some money? \nMILES I'm fine. \nMiles takes another drink of wine. \nCUT TO BLACK: \nUNDER BLACK, a CARD -- \nSUNDAY \nMILES (O.S.) Jack. Jack. \nINT. MILES'S APARTMENT BEDROOM - DAY \nJack finally awakens with a start and finds Miles standing above him, shaking him. \nWIDE -- \nAs Jack gets up, we see he has crashed on Phyllis's bed adorned with all her decorative PILLOWS. \nINT. MILES'S MOTHER'S LIVING ROOM - DAY \nStill in her pantsuit and smeared makeup, Phyllis lies sprawled and snoring on the sofa. On the TV, ostensibly never turned off the night before, is an inane CARTOON. \nAs Miles opens the front door, he spots Jack heading toward the TV to turn it off. Miles waves him off. \nMILES (a loud whisper) She'll wake up. \nAs they leave and Miles closes the front door quietly behind him, we PAN to the flowers still wrapped and forgotten on a side table. \nINT. ROADSIDE IHOP - DAY \nTWO PLATES OF FOOD float in front of two breasts tucked inside a zippered uniform. \nWIDER -- \nDisheveled and unshaven, Jack and Miles are served breakfast by a young, innocently sexy WAITRESS. Jack leers after her. \nJACK Fuck, man. Too early in the morning for that, you know what I mean? \nMILES She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore. \nJACK That's your problem, Miles. \n", "test1_id": 1842, "test2_input": "MILES As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place. \nJACK Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages. \nMILES It's not worth it. You pay too big a price. It's never free. \nThey eat in silence a moment. \nJACK You need to get laid. \nMiles shrugs off the comment. \nJACK It'd be the best thing for you. You know what? I'm going to get you laid this week. That's going to be my best man gift to you. I'm not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit. \nMILES I'd rather have a knife. \nJACK No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books. \nMILES I'm working on it. \nMiles concentrates on his eggs and hash browns \nJACK You still seeing that shrink? \nMILES I went on Monday. But I spent most of the time helping him with his computer. \nJACK Well, I say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax? \nMILES And Lexapro, yes. \nJACK Well, I say fuck that. You need to get your joint worked on, that's what you need. \nMILES Jack. This week is not about me. It's about you. I'm going to show you a good time. We're going to drink a lot of good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and send you off in style. \nJACK And get your bone smooched. \nJack spots the waitress coming out of the kitchen and motions for more coffee. She nods and smiles, indicating she'll be right over. Jack returns the smile and holds up a hand to signal he'll wait. Jack turns back to see Miles watching him. \nJACK What? \nEXT. CENTRAL COAST - DAY \nIn a series of shots, the Saab -- now with its TOP DOWN -- makes its way onto the 101 and travels past landmarks that those familiar with the Santa Barbara area might recognize. \nMUSIC accompanies this sequence that anchors us into the rhythm of a road trip. \nINT./EXT. SAAB - DAY \nThe car now descends the Santa Ynez Mountains and heads toward Buellton. Miles and Jack must SHOUT to be heard in the open car. \nMILES You know what? Let's take the Santa Rosa turnoff and hit Sanford first. \nJACK Whatever's closest, man. I need a glass. \nMILES These guys make top-notch Pinot and Chardonnay. One of the best producers in Santa Barbara county. (looking out the window) Look how beautiful this view is. What a day! \nJACK I thought you hated Chardonnay. \nMILES I like all varietals. I just don't generally like the way they manipulate Chardonnay in California -- too much oak and secondary malolactic fermentation. \nEXT. SANTA ROSA TURN-OFF - DAY \nThe Saab passes over the 101 and turns onto SANTA ROSA road. \nINT./EXT. SAAB - DAY \nThe boys now pass vineyards of immaculate grapevines. \nMILES Jesus, what a day! Isn't it gorgeous? And the ocean's just right over that ridge. See, the reason this region's great for Pinot is that the cold air off the Pacific flows in at night through these transverse valleys and cools down the berries. Pinot's a very thin-skinned grape and doesn't like heat or humidity. \nJack looks at Miles, admiring his friend's vast learning and articulateness. \nThe Saab now pulls of the road and makes its way down a long gravel DRIVEWAY. \nJACK Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel sells. \nMILES Thanks, Jack. So do I. (noticing) Here we are. \nEXT. SANFORD TASTING ROOM - DAY \nMiles brings the car to a stop in the parking lot. As they get out and walk -- \nMILES So what'd you guys finally decide on for the menu? \nJACK I told you. Filet and salmon. \nMILES Yeah, but how are they making the salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry? \nJACK I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish? \nMILES Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference. \nJACK (taking out his phone) Let me call Christine. \nMILES Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste. \nJACK I owe her a call anyway. \nMiles must curb his eagerness to go inside the tasting room as Jack SPEED DIALS. \nJACK Hey, honey. So we're up here about to taste some whites, and we need to know how the caterers are going to make the salmon. \n", "test2_true": "JACK No, I know, I didn't forget, but we wound up at Miles's mom's house, and it got really late, and it was hard to call, so I'm calling you now. I said I was sorry. Yes, I did. (to Miles) You heard me say I was sorry, right? \nMiles just shrugs. \nJACK Miles heard me say I was sorry. \nAs Jack gets more and more involved with the phone call, he wanders off across the parking lot, progressively out of earshot. \nJACK Give me a break, will you? I just called to find out about the salmon -- for our wedding -- to be more involved, like you said -- and all you want to do is get into it about last night and, okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't call. You're totally right. I know, but I'm trying to make this the best wedding I can with the best wine we can find. Don't I get any credit for that? Okay. Look, I've got to go. I'm out here in the parking lot, and Miles is waiting for me... \nAnd so it goes, Jack's voice rising and falling. Miles decides to head inside. \nINT. SANFORD TASTING ROOM - DAY \nMiles is at the bar, TWO GLASSES in front of him. Jack walks in and bellies up next to him. \nJACK (proudly) Baked with a butter-lime glaze. \nMILES Now we're talking. \nCHRIS BURROUGHS, a POURER in a cowboy hat and ponytail, comes over. \nCHRIS This is the condemned man? \nMILES Here he is. Jack, Chris. Chris, Jack. \nChris and Jack shake hands. \nJACK How you doing? \nCHRIS You guys want to start with the Vin Gris? \nJACK Sounds good. \nTWO GLASSES are filled with small amounts of PINOT NOIR VIN GRIS. \nJACK This is rose, right? \nMILES Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir. \nJACK Pinot noir? Not again! (joking, to Chris) You know, not all Pinots are noir. \nThey laugh. \nMiles swirls his glass in tight circles on the bar, then lifts it to smell. Jack clumsily imitates Miles, perhaps even spilling some wine in the process. \nMILES Let me show you. \nWe see details of what Miles now describes. \nMILES First take your glass and examine the wine against the light. You're looking at color and clarity. \nJACK What color is it supposed to be? \nMILES Depends on the varietal. Just get a sense of it. Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy? Inky? Amber, whatever... \nJACK Huh. \nMILES Now tip it. What you're doing here is checking for color density as it thins toward the rim. Tells you how old it is, among other things, usually more important with reds. This is a very young wine, so it's going to retain its color pretty solidly. Now stick your nose in it. \nJack waves the glass under his nose as if it were a perfume bottle. \nMILES Don't be shy. Get your nose in there. \nJack now buries his nose in the glass. \nMILES What do you smell? \nJACK I don't know. Wine? Fermented grapes? \nMiles smells. \nMILES There's not much there yet, but you can still find... (more sniffs) ...a little citrus... maybe some strawberry... passion fruit... and there's even a hint of like asparagus... or like a nutty Edam cheese. \nJack smells again and begins to brighten. \nJACK Huh. Maybe a little strawberry. Yeah, strawberry. I'm not so sure about the cheese. \nMILES Now set your glass down and get some air into it. \nMiles expertly swirls the wine. Jack follows suit. \nMILES Oxygenating it opens it up, unlocks the aroma and the flavors. Very important. Now we smell again. \nThey do so. Jack smiles. \nMILES That's what you do with every one. \nJACK When do we get to drink it? \nMILES Now. \nJack gulps his wine down in one shot. Miles chews his before swallowing. \nJACK How would you rate this one? \nMILES Usually they start you on the wines with learning disabilities, but this one's pretty damn good. (to Chris) This is the new one, right, Chris? \nCHRIS Released it about two months ago. \nMILES Nice job. \n", "test2_id": 1843, "test3_input": "Miles waves his hand in a gesture of \"Get it over with.\" \nGrunting with effort, Jack leans inside the car and drops the foundation block onto the GAS PEDAL. \nDirect hit! Jack leaps backward and hits the dirt just in time. \nMiles and Jack watch the driverless Saab race toward the tree, its speed increasing. But just before hitting it, the car drifts to one side and SAILS RIGHT PAST. \nMILES Oh, fuck! \nThe car zooms wildly across the vacant lot and, missing the tree, continues on until CRASHING THROUGH A FENCE and finally toppling headlong into a CEMENT TRENCH. Only the back of the car remains visible. \nThe whole thing is finished in a matter of seconds. Still frozen in place, Miles and Jack turn slowly to each other. \nJACK It's okay. I've got Triple A. \nEXT. 101 FREEWAY - DAY \nFrom in front of the Saab, we see its now CRUMPLED HOOD and FENDER, a couple of BUNGEE CORDS holding the whole thing together. \nEXT. PALOS VERDES STREET - DAY \nThe Saab approaches the end of the line. \nEXT. ERGANIAN HOUSE --DAY \nAT THE FRONT PORCH -- \nMiles has helped Jack carry his bags and the wine. He plops the last case down. \nMILES Well. That about does it. \nJACK Why don't you come in? \nMILES Uh-uh. You're on your own. \nJACK So I'll see you at the rehearsal. \nMILES Yeah. \nThey give each other a brief manly back-slappy hug. \nJACK Love you, man. \nMILES Back at you. \nMiles heads toward the curb. \nJACK Hey, don't pull away till they see the car. \nMILES (over his shoulder) Yeah. (turning around) Hey, why wasn't I injured? \nJACK (big smile) You were wearing your belt. \nBACK AT HIS CAR -- \nMiles gets in and watches through the side window as Mrs. Erganian opens the front door and welcomes Jack with shock and dismay. Jack points back at -- \nMILES raising one hand in a feeble wave. The camera slowly MOVES CLOSER as he continues to watch -- \nJACK -- \nweaving his story of woe. He's a great actor when he wants to be. Mr. Erganian and a mortified Christine come to the door too. Mr. Erganian takes a few steps toward the car to get a better look. \nVERY CLOSE ON MILES -- \nwatching the drama play out. Then his eyes drop as he momentarily loses himself in melancholy. This reverie is interrupted by -- \nTHE VOICE OF AN ARMENIAN PRIEST \nStartled, Miles turns to look at -- \nA PRIEST \nwho is singing the BLESSING OF THE RINGS. \nWe are now in -- \nINT. ARMENIAN APOSTOLIC CHURCH - DAY \nThe church is packed. \nCLOSE ON THE RINGS as the priest holds them aloft. \nIf those rings could talk... Jack shoots a quick look at Miles, who looks right back. The priest continues his blessing. \nEXT. ARMENIAN CHURCH - DAY \nAT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS -- \nThe WEDDING FAMILIES greet the exiting guests in a RECEIVING LINE. Smiling and exuberant, Jack seems utterly at home as the new groom. \nAT THE BOTTOM OF THE STEPS -- \nMiles watches the scene, not without melancholy. Then -- \nVICTORIA (O.S.) Hey, Miles. \nMiles turns and looks up to see Victoria, standing one step above him. Just behind her is her NEW HUSBAND. He exudes the quiet confidence of a successful businessman who played college football, takes expensive skiing and sailing vacations, and hasn't read a novel since high school. \nMILES Hi, Vicki. (taking her in) You look beautiful. \n", "test3_true": "From his spot hovering over Miles, Ken leans down and offers his hand. \nKEN How are you? \nMILES Hi. How you doing? You're a lucky guy. \nKEN Thanks. (to Victoria) I'll wait for you at the car. (to Miles) Nice to meet you, Miles. \nMILES Ken. \nExit Ken. \nMILES That was big of him. \nVICTORIA Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate. \nMILES That's great. \nVICTORIA So how're you doing? \nMILES Since the last time we spoke? I don't know. Could be better. Could be worse. \nVICTORIA So what's happening with your book? \nMILES Universally rejected. Strike three. \nVICTORIA Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do? \nMILES Back to the drawing board, I guess. Or not. So... you're married. Congratulations. You look happy. \nVICTORIA I am. \nMILES Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess. \nVICTORIA I guess. \nJust then a BLACK LINCOLN NAVIGATOR pulls up alongside the curb. The passenger side window is halfway down, and the sounds of Adult Contemporary Jazz waft out. Victoria gives Ken a little wave. \nMILES (shifting gears) Well, let's go have some champagne, shall we? Toast all the newlyweds. \nVICTORIA Not me. I'm not drinking. \nMILES You quit drinking? \nVICTORIA I'm pregnant. \nMILES (hit in the solar plexus) Oh. Huh. Well... (rallying) Congratulations again, Vicki. That's wonderful news. \nVICTORIA (going to the car) See you over there, Miles. \nMILES Yeah. \nAs she gets in the car and cruises away, Miles glances back at -- \nTHE RECEIVING LINE \n-- where Mike Erganian is introducing Jack to some dear old FRIENDS. Mike throws a loving arm around his new son-in-law, and Jack is drawn into Mike's bosom. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nA HAND-PAINTED SIGN, attached to a STOP SIGH and decorated with balloons, reads: \"RECEPTION THIS WAY!\" with an arrow pointing RIGHT. \nOne by one, CARS are making a right turn. But when his turn comes, Miles turns LEFT. \nEXT. MILES'S APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY \nThe Saab pull up outside. Miles leaves the car idling as he sprints inside. Moments later he sprints back to his car, this time carrying SOMETHING. \nOMIT \nINT. FAST FOOD PLACE - DAY \nHis bowtie undone, Miles sits at a booth eating. He washes down a bite by draining the contents of a big wax-coated soft drink cup. \nHe brings the cup to his lap and refills it from a BOTTLE OF WINE hidden next to him. As he sets the bottle back down, we glimpse the label: 1961 Cheval Blanc. \nHe takes another sip. As the camera MOVES CLOSER, all the complex emotions inspired by the wine ripple across Miles's face. \n14-YEAR-OLD BOY (O.S.) \"The marrow of his bone,\" I repeated aimlessly. This at least penetrated my mind. Phineas had died from the marrow of his bone flowing down his blood stream to his heart. \nINT. MIDDLE SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY \nThe voice belongs to one of Miles's PUPILS reading aloud in class. Other students follow along silently from their own copies of A Separate Peace. \nSUPERIMPOSED -- \nFIVE WEEKS LATER \nMiles sits behind his desk at the front of the class. \n14-YEAR-OLD BOY I did not cry then or ever about Finny. I did not cry even when I stood watching him being lowered into his family's straight-laced burial ground outside of Boston. I could not escape a feeling that this was my own funeral, and you do not cry in that case. \nThe students look up. \n14-YEAR-OLD BOY Do you want me to keep reading the next chapter, Mr. Raymond? \nMILES (as though coming to) Hrnrnrn? No, we'll pick up there on Monday. \nINT. MILES'S APARTMENT - EVENING \nMiles enters his tiny apartment. He loosens his tie and puts down his satchel. \n", "test3_id": 1844}

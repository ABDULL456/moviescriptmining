Fear overwhelmed by curiosity. \nBOURNE I would grow up thinking that they didn't love me if they just left me like that. \nIrena making sure her eyes don't leave his.    They don't. \nBOURNE (CONT'D) (cont'd) It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it? \nIRENA (wary) Yes... \nBOURNE That's not what happened to your parents. \nIRENA Then what? \nBOURNE I killed them. \nBody blows, but he has her attention.    She wipes a tear. \nBOURNE (CONT'D)                        * It was my jo   b. My first time. Your father was s   upposed to be alone. But then your mother,    she came out of nowhere...

Stands because if she doesn't she'll burst into tears.

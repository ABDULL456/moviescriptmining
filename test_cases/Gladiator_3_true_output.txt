MAXIMUS I only have ancestors because of you, brother.  You killed everything that ever lived alongside me. 
A beat. 
COMMODUS Take it, Maximus.  Let us heal that fatal wound together. 
MAXIMUS This is the new home you cursed me to.  And I am safer here from your treachery than I could ever be outside. 
COMMODUS Will you always mistrust me? 
MAXIMUS Why don't you ask your father that? 
Commodus visibly flinches at that, but still holds the wooden sword out.  The crowd is breathless. 
MAXIMUS I have more power as a slave in the arena than I could ever have as a free man.  As the Colosseum goes, the people go.  As the people go, the Empire goes. 
COMMODUS (tense) You think this is power?  I could show you power, slave -- 
MAXIMUS No, Caesar... I will show you. 
With that, Maximus does the unimaginable.  He simply turns his back on the Emperor and walks away. 
And the crowd goes mad.  They cheer the defiant gladiator, their champion. 
And, equally, they deride the Emperor.  They mock him by holding out food and trash like Commodus is holding out the wooden sword.  They laugh and jeer. 
Commodus glances around at his children, lost. 
Then he turns to the Imperial Box.  He sees Lucilla slipping out the back of the box.  He watches her go. 
And the crowd continues to jeer. 
EXT.  STREET THEATER - NIGHT 
The crowd laughs riotously as Roman Actors perform a typically ribald comedy in a secluded street: 
An outrageously dressed version of Maximus is parading around on an outrageously dressed version of Commodus, riding him like a donkey and slapping his rear with a wooden sword.  The "Commodus" actor mews and brays and wails like an infant. 
Captain Marcellus of the City Guard gallops past them, on his way out of Rome. 
EXT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - COURTYARD - DAY 
Maximus stands with Juba and Vibius.  He draws a circle in the sand with a stick.  He draws a line to the circle. 
MAXIMUS The Felix Regiment will come from here.  We'll face the body of the Praetorians outside -- here.  Once inside, my archers will take up position to counter opposition inside the Colosseum.  I'll enter and join you -- we'll attack here -- 
Maximus draws a line to the Imperial Box. 
MAXIMUS -- a covert assault from within. 
VIBIUS We'll be killed. 
MAXIMUS Probably. 
A beat. 
MAXIMUS But if we aren't... think of the glory.  Do you remember glory, Gladiator? 
JUBA And if we die that day -- we die free men worthy of our ancestors. 
VIBIUS You didn't know my ancestors.  A rotten bunch. 
Maximus points to the huge statue of Mars. 
MAXIMUS Then be worthy of him.  The old Titan who would rather die bravely in a just battle than slink off to grow old and fat. 
JUBA And impotent. 
A beat.  Vibius thinks about it. 
VIBIUS If I die, I want a hundred whores at my funeral. 
INT.  PALACE - LUCILLA'S CHAMBERS - EVENING 
Commodus sweeps in.  Thinks Lucilla is standing there. The woman turns, it is Lucilla's Handmaiden. 
COMMODUS Where is my sister? 
HANDMAIDEN She's out, sir... 
COMMODUS Where? 
HANDMAIDEN I... don't know, Caesar. 
Commodus looks at her for a moment.

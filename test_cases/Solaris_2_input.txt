First, over BLACK, we hear the sound of a light rain. 
Then: 
A MAN'S VOICE I'm not a poet.  I've never moved anyone with my words. (beat) Maybe that's why they chose me. 
EXT.  WOODS - DAY 
A mural of leafless trees beneath an overcast sky.  Rain continues to fall. 
Maybe now we begin to notice a strange quality to the light (or is it the sky?).  Something vaguely unsettling. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  BEDROOM - MORNING 
Still, the sound of rain is heard. 
A MAN 
40s, lies on his side in bed, staring at us. 
He has not been sleeping.  In fact, judging from his distant expression, he has not slept in ages. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  ROAD - DAY 
Less like a road and more like a path that you maneuver a vehicle through. 
The Man, dressed in rain gear, walks down the middle.  He is accompanied by a medium-sized LABRADOR, and seems in no particular hurry. 
The sound of tires appear and grow in intensity.  The Man, without saying an actual word, instructs the dog to heal. The dog obeys as the Man moves off the road.  The vehicle hurtles past him -- its engine quiet, its windows darkened -- spraying muddy debris in its wake. 
Seconds later, the car brakes abruptly and skids to a stop. 
THE MAN 
Stops walking and stares at the car, which seems ominously still. 
The car then reverses direction and begins to move toward the Man, who remains motionless. 
When the car is alongside him, a darkened window turns transparent and we see a WELL-DRESSED BUREAUCRAT in the rear seat.  His demeanor is pleasant and professional. 
WELL-DRESSED BUREAUCRAT Dr. Kelvin? 
The Man he is addressing, who we now understand is CHRIS KELVIN, stares back at him.

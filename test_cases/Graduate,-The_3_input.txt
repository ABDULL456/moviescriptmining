ELAINE Please - will somebody tell me - 
She looks back at Ben, then back at her mother's face again. Mrs. Robinson's eyes watch her through the crack in the door.  Elaine looks away. 
ELAINE Oh - no. 
Ben backs up. 
BEN Elaine - 
ELAINE Oh my God - 
Moving along the wall as though to keep as far from Ben as possible, Elaine moves away from the door. 
BEN Please. 
Elaine walks a few steps toward the other side of the room then turns back toward Ben.  The tears are starting out of her eyes. 
BEN No - don't cry - 
ELAINE GET OUT! 
BEN Don't cry. (holds the package out to her) 
ELAINE Get out of here. 
She moves toward him as though to hit him.  He backs into the hall.  Elaine SLAMS the door shut. 
ELAINE (holding the door) Get out! 
132	INT. ROBINSON HALL - DAY 
Mrs. Robinson stands at the end of it, looking at Ben. 
MRS. ROBINSON (calmly) Goodbye, Benjamin. 
133	SHOT - BENJAMIN 
He looks at her in horror.  He starts to back down the hall toward the stairs, holding the package against his chest. 
134	INT. SPECIAL SET - ROBINSON HALL - DAY - SHOT - PULLING BACK FROM MRS. ROBINSON 
She is standing there, perfectly calm.  She gets further and further away as though it is a very long hall in a very bad dream. 
FADE OUT 
FADE IN 
135	INT. BEN'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Ben sits cross-legged on his bed in the dark, his back against the fishtank, smoking. 
DISSOLVE THROUGH TO:

Ben drives by in his car.  He looks at the house. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
137	INT. BEN'S ROOM  - DAY 
Ben dressed differently, stands by the window overlooking the backyard.  Over his shoulder, we can see Mr. Braddock down by the pool, dressed in a sweater, cleaning the pool with a long-handled scoop.  Mr. Braddock looks up at Ben's window.  Ben moves aside. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
138	EXT. ROBINSON HOUSE - DAY 
Ben is standing behind a tree watching the Robinson house.  In the driveway of the Robinson house, Elaine is getting into the Robinson car.  Mr. Robinson is putting Elaine's luggage into the car.  Mrs. Robinson stands at the door.  Mr. Robinson gets into the car and starts it.  The car drives down the driveway and down the street. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
139	INT. BEN'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Ben, dressed differently again, sits in a chair by his desk.  He is writing.  On the piece of paper is written: DEAR ELAINE, ELAINE, ELAINE, ELAINE, and her name several dozen times.  He stops and looks up. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
140	INT. BRADDOCK KITCHEN - DAY 
It is early morning.  We see a swinging door pushed open to reveal:  Mr. Braddock, dressed in a bathrobe, standing at the kitchen counter by the window through which we can see an orange tree.  Mr. Braddock is pouring orange juice from a MINUTE MAID container.  Ben stands inside door. 
MR. BRADDOCK Say that again. 
BEN I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson. 
MR. BRADDOCK STARTS TO SMILE. 
MR. BRADDOCK Well - well - well - 
He almost giggles as he crosses to Ben and takes his hand to shake it.  Mrs. Braddock appears in the doorway.  Ben is shaking his father's hand. 
MRS. BRADDOCK What's happening? 
MR. BRADDOCK Ben says he and Elaine are getting married. 
MRS. BRADDOCK I don't believe it. 
MR. BRADDOCK That what he says.  Right? 
BEN I'm going up to Berkeley today. 
MRS. BRADDOCK Oh, Ben - this is so - exciting - 
MR. BRADDOCK Come on, let's call the Robinsons. We've got something to celebrate. 
BEN No.  I think you'll want to wait on that. 
MRS. BRADDOCK They don't know? 
BEN No - they don't.

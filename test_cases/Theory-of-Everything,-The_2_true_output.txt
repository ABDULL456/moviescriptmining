INT. STEPHEN'S ROOM / OXFORD UNIVERSITY - DAY 
STEPHEN, huddled against the door, refused to answer      it. 
EXT. CROQUET LAWN, CAMBRIDGE - DAY 
JANE walks past the empty lawn. 
INT. PUB ON THE RIVER, CAMBRIDGE - DAY 
Full of undergraduates. 
JANE enters, looks around for STEPHEN. Can't see him. 
BRIAN, seated with the other YOUNG PHYSICISTS, spots her. 
BRIAN Jane! 
JANE comes up the young men. 
JANE Brian--have you seen Stephen? 
BRIAN Jane, have a seat. 
JANE sits. 
JANE What is it? 
BRIAN I understand you saw him. You know he was in hospital... 
JANE nods, as the CAMERA pulls back from the scene, leaving BRIAN (sensitively) to pass the terrible news to JANE. 
INT. COMBINATION ROOM/TRINITY HALL/CAMBRIDGE - DAY

(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   32 
CONTINUED: STEPHEN (CONT'D) John is having an affair with Martha. But Martha is in love with Alan. And I think Alan is homosexual by the look of his shirts. I'm trying to work out the mathematical probability of happiness.

STEPHEN You just missed him. He was here earlier. 
JANE Don't do this. 
STEPHEN What? 
JANE Cut me off. 
STEPHEN Go. 
JANE Teach me croquet. (PAUSE) Come on. Teach me. (PAUSE) What is this? 
STEPHEN I believe you poetry under- graduate types call it..."a slough of despond." 
JANE If you don't get up and play a game with me I won't come back here again. Ever. 
Silence. He finally looks at her. ANGRILY he rises. And walks off ahead of her. She watches him. THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   33 
EXT. CROQUET LAWN - 
JANE AIMS, STRIKES, hits a FEEBLE SHOT. 
STEPHEN My turn. 
STEPHEN AIMS, HITS his BALL through the FIRST HOOP, then walks, as best he can, off toward his BALL, using his MALLET as a WALKING STICK. With his second shot he hits her BALL. He then picks up his BALL, places it beside hers so that it touches, puts his foot on his ball, then smacks his BALL HARD with his MALLET, blasting her ball down to the next hoop. 
He proceeds to play a MASTER GAME that will not allow JANE another shot, enlisting her ball to advance his own from HOOP to HOOP, until -

INT. ANN'S 
Sitting halfway down the bar is Amy, staring morosely into a coffee cup. AT the CUT we are TRACKING BACK, PULLING AWAY FROM her. 
Norville enters, comes up next to her and makes the Go Eagles sign, hooking his thumbs in front of his nose and spreading his fingers. 
Two familiar voices narrate the scene, sounding a little tipsy: 
LOU (O.S.) What the heck's he doin', Benny? 
Amy looks at Norville, startled. After a moment she reciprocates the sign. 
BENNY (O.S.) What the heck's she doin', Lou? 
LOU (O.S.) What the heck they doin'? 
Norville and Amy embrace. 
BENNY (O.S.) You know what they're doin' now, Lou. 
LOU (O.S.) This I know, Benny. 
BENNY (O.S.) This you're familia' with. 
Our PULL BACK ENDS LOOKING ACROSS an elbow of the bar, TOWARDS Norville and Amy, now in WIDE SHOT. Resting on the bar in the extreme f.g. are two champagne glasses, half-full of fizzing champagne. 
Norville and Amy kiss. 
LOU (O.S.) ...Geez. 
BENNY (O.S.) ...Geez. 
We hear LABORED, RASPY BREATHING. 
LOU (O.S.) ...Y'all right, Benny? 
In a quavering voice: 
BENNY (O.S.) ...Yeah, I'm... It's just... It's beautiful, Lou! 
Lou also is beginning to sound choked up: 
LOU (O.S.) It is beautiful, Benny. 
Almost weeping as Norville and Amy continue their embrace: 
BENNY (O.S.) ...It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw. 
LOU (O.S.) It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw. 
A BARTENDER ENTERS to BLOCK our VIEW of Norville and Amy. 
He is youngish, with a beat goatee, wearing dungarees and a sweatshirt with cut-off sleeves. He looks to either side at Benny and Lou. 
BARTENDER You cats comin' from a party? 
BENNY Cabbies' affair. 
LOU Hacks' New Year's gala. 
BARTENDER Crazy. Get you anything else? Sangria? Carrot juice? Herbal tea? 
REVERSE ANGLE 
We see Benny and Lou are sitting side by side at the bar. 
Lou wears a fake whispy beard and white eyebrows and a long flowing robe; he holds a fake scythe. On the bar next to him sits a large hourglass. 
LOU Bromo. 
Benny is wearing nothing but an oversized diaper, a baby bonnett and a sash across his hairy chest and thick belly that says "1959." 
He chucks himself in the heart, cocks his head and sucks in air, then blows it back out. 
BENNY ...Bromo. 
BLUE LETTER 
Lying on the boardroom table. As a hand enters to lay a wristwatch on the table next to it, we hear the voice of Moses, the old maintenance man. 
MOSES (V.O.) And so began 1959. The new year... 
The hand reenters to lay down a wallet, and then to deposit a burning cigar in an ashtray. 
MOSES (V.O.) ...And the start of a new business cycle. When he learned that Norville owned the comp'ny, ol' Sidney was upset at first. 
We TILT UP to show that Mussburger is walking toward the boardroom window. Board members silently remonstrate with him as he tries to wrench it open. 
MOSES (V.O.) ...It's a good thing Doc Bromfenbrenner was there... 
Doctor Bromfenbrenner stands to one side watching, brow furrowed, a pencil pressed to his lips. 
MOSES (V.O.) ...'cause he was able to keep Sidney from harmin' his ol' self. 
We... 
CUT TO: 
BARRED DOOR 
being slammed behind Sidney who, straight-jacketed, is puffing on a cigar as he is led away. 
MOSES (V.O.) ...Now Norville, he went on an' ruled with wisdom and compassion...

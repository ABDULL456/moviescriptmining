RIPLEY I got a belly full of that from the Psychtechs when I was on Earth.  Yeah. "Survivor Guilt syndrome," or something like that.  But that's not what I was thinking about.  I was thinking about my "friend" up there. 
She looks up. 
RIPLEY He was on the pod.  He killed Newt but not me.  Why not me?  It's almost like he's playing with me.  Maybe they have some sort of race memory.  Maybe he knows what I did to his "mother." That's why he didn't just kill me. That would be too easy.  He has to torment me. 
JOHN You make it sound human. 
RIPLEY Hell, I don't know what it is. 
John unconsiously fingers his book. 
JOHN I think I do. 
INT. LADDER-WELL - PRISON LEVEL - NIGHT 
At the end of the space a rough hewn wooden ladder leads to another block of cell corridors four stories up. Years of damp air have warped the ladder. Ripley leads the way, torch in her left hand. They climb... 
INT. END OF PRISON CORRIDOR - FOURTH LEVEL - NIGHT 
Dark.  Ripley is the first one up. She raises her torch and heads down the new corridor alone. The cells here have no doors. She holds her torch in one -- An old skeleton sits in quiet contemplation. 
AT THE LADDER 
John is just climbing off, Anthony right behind him. Anthony is winded.  He reaches up for a helping hand. John looks back and sees that Ripley has moved ahead without them, then reaches down to help Anthony. Their hands clasp -- 
ANTHONY HAS A "VISION" 
He is seemingly standing in an open field, sheep grazing peacefully at his side. SUDDENLY he is ATTACKED by a horde of Medieval demons. 
Fish faced demons.  Man-headed bird demons. They fly about him, grab hold of his limbs. The Sheep nearest him opens it's mouth to reveal a horde of razor sharp fangs, SINKS THEM INTO HIS ANKLE -- 
Anthony SCREAMS -! 
RIPLEY 
Down the corridor HEARS the scream, turns back -- sees Anthony fighting with himself, struggling against John's grasp - 
ANTHONY 
Balanced precariously on the top of the ladder in the real world as he fights against the demons in his android mind -- He JERKS -- Pulls his left ankle out of the grasp of the DEMON SHEEP -- OFF the ladder - forty foot drop waiting below him... 
JOHN 
Struggles to keep his death grip on Anthony's hand. It's all that keeps Anthony from falling back down the shaft -- 
JOHN Jesus Christ.  Ripleeeee -! 
He PULLS with all his might... 
ANTHONY 
SEES a horrible BIRD-DEMON grasping his hand in its beak -- BITING through his wrist.  He waves his staff in the air -- He aims for its head: CRACK -! WHACKS John's hand with his staff -- 
John HOWLS in pain - LETS GO -- 
Anthony TEETERS BACK ON ONE FOOT, arms waving in the air -- 
Ripley's hands SHOOT OUT -- GRAB Anthony's cassock -- STOP his fall. 
Anthony's eyes open wide at the sight of this new horror -- A terrible, wet, black cable-armed CREATURE that's latched itself onto his cassock -- Long, shiny head. Ripley has become the Alien. 
WHACK! Anthony HITS the Creature with his staff -- HITS Ripley on the head. WHACK! Again.  In the face. 
John tries to take hold of Anthony's staff arm -- WHACK! The cane WHIPS against the side of his head, knocking him back. Ripley sets her feet and pulls on Anthony's cassock -- Opens her mouth - GRUNTS -- 
ANTHONY sees the terrible Alien open it's maw to devour him. 
WHACK! His staff connects with the bridge of Ripley's nose. She sees flashes of light -- loses her balance -- Pitches forward, starts to go over with Anthony -- 
JOHN GRABS THEM! 
Wraps his arms around the struggling pair and like a sumo wrestler LIFTS and FALLS backwards - carrying the three of them into the corridor -- WHUMPH! 
They land on the floor in a heap. Anthony continues to FLAIL ABOUT -- 
Ripley and John pin him to the floor between them. Finally, the vision leaves him. He loses consciousness. 
JOHN

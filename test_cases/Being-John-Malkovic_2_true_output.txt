With a gasp and a wail of release, Lotte pops into the ditch. She is soaking wet and breathes heavily. She just lies there.

INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S KITCHEN - MORNING 
Craig is hunched over a cup of coffee. The front door can be heard to open. After a moment Lotte appears in the kitchen doorway. She is caked with dirt. Craig looks up at her. 
CRAIG You were him last night, weren't you? 
LOTTE (quietly) Yes. 
CRAIG And he was with her. 
LOTTE We love her, Craig. I'm sorry. 
CRAIG We? 
LOTTE Me and John. 
CRAIG Don't forget me. 
LOTTE Well, you have the Maxine action figure to play with. 
Craig looks down at his coffee. 
LOTTE (CONT'D) I'm sorry. That was nasty. 
CRAIG Life is confusing, isn't it? 
LOTTE Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions. (beat) I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship. 
CRAIG I feel that somehow my parents never prepared me to make this particular decision. Not that I blame them. How could they know? Today's world is so complicated. (beat) No. I have to go away now. I'm sorry, Lotte. I'm so sorry.

INT. CRAIG AND MAXINE'S OFFICE - MORNING 
Craig enters with red-rimmed eyes. Maxine sits at her desk, actually looking kind of radiant. 
MAXINE You're late. 
CRAIG Are you torturing me on purpose? 
MAXINE (matter of fact) I've fallen in love. 
CRAIG I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like. 
MAXINE You picked the unrequited variety. Very bad for the skin. 
CRAIG You're evil, Maxine. 
MAXINE Do you have any idea what its like to have two people look at you with total lust and devotion through the same pair of eyes? No I don't suppose you would. It's quite a thrill, Craig. 
Craig turns and walks out the door.

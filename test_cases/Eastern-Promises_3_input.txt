1   EXT. A STREET NEAR BRICK LANE - EVENING                       1 
It's 5.30pm in late December and rain is pouring. The scant Christmas decorations are hanging limp in the rain. A young Turk (EKREM) runs through the rain with a Turkish newspaper held over his head. He ducks into a traditional barber's shop called Ozim's. 
2   INT. OZIM'S BARBER SHOP - EVENING                             2 
The shutters are drawn. OZIM (a plump middle-aged Turk) is cutting the hair of the last customer of the day (SOYKA). Soyka is a Chechen, well-groomed, wearing a sharp suit beneath the barber's gown. 
During the conversation we glimpse distinctive eagle- and star-shaped tattoos on Soyka's arms and hands. 
Ozim and Soyka are chatting as Ekrem enters.   Soyka speaks with a Russian accent. 
OZIM Guvenilmez... daginik... bloody kids, you know... he says - `but Amca it's Christmas?... Christmas! We're Islam! 
SOYKA Oi, how much are you taking off? 
OZIM Christmas! So I said to him... alisverise cimac. The kid's sixteen... 
Ozim brushes some hair off the customer's shoulder and Ozim finally acknowledges Ekrem, who is shivering and wet near to the door. Ekrem turns the `Open' sign to `Closed'. 
OZIM (CONT'D) They don't want to work do they. Shicma.... 
EKREM (hesitantly interrupting) Uncle Ozim....... 
We see for the first time that Ekrem is shaking with fear as well as cold.

OZIM This is him.     The kid I'm talking about. 
Ekrem approaches, stiffened by terror.       Soyka nods at Ekrem in the mirror. 
SOYKA He looks OK to me... how you doin' Ekrem? 
Soyka offers Ekrem a hand to shake and Ekrem stares at it as if it were enchanted... 
OZIM He looks OK, yeah, but he won't do one lousy thing for me. Here, look... Ekrem, take this... 
Ozim takes an open razor from behind a line of hair-tonic bottles and hands it to Ekrem, who now looks mortally terrified. 
EKREM Ozim... memnum etmek. 
OZIM We had a deal now he's backing out. 
SOYKA (laughing) Hey Ozim, leave the kid alone. It's obviously a psychological thing... 
OZIM Take it Ekrem. 
SOYKA Ozim, it's OK. I don't want a shave. 
OZIM This is the kid who walks around like Al Capone. Take the fucking ustura and finish this Rushca. 
SOYKA (startled) What? 
(CONTINUED) BLUE Revision    -   11/4/06                              3. 
2   CONTINUED: (2)                                                 2 
Soyka rises up from the seat, casting off his barber's gown. Ozim yells `kabuka! And Ekrem snarls, flicks open the razor and drags it across Soyka's throat. Soyka's scream bubbles in the blood. 
3   EXT. KILBURN HIGH ROAD - NIGHT                                 3 
We dissolve to a Christmas decoration flashing on and off in the rain, high on a lamp post in Kilburn High Road. We pan down the lamp post to the High Road where revelers are hurrying through the rain. We see a young girl (TATIANA) hurrying across the street, wrapped in a dressing gown with a man's overcoat thrown over the top of it. Her hair is soaked as she approaches an all night chemist's shop. She is barefoot. 
4   INT. CHEMIST'S SHOP - NIGHT                                    4 
The CHEMIST is delivering advice in Gujurati to a CUSTOMER. Tatiana wipes rain from her face and the Chemist and the customer react to her ragged appearance. 
TATIANA (Russian accent) Please... I have... 
CHEMIST For methadone I need to see paper prescription. 
The customer looks at Tatiana's feet and reacts. We see blood trickling down her legs. Tatiana looks down, then faints onto the floor. 
5   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. OPERATING WARD - NIGHT                5 
We see Tatiana unconscious on a wheeled trolley bursting through double doors into the operating ward of Trafalgar hospital. The trolley is accompanied by TWO NURSES, a JUNIOR DOCTOR and a midwife, (ANNA KHITROVA). The two PARAMEDICS who brought her are following behind the trolley.

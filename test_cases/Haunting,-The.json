{"train": "\"The Haunting\", production draft, revised by Michael Tolkin \nTHE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE \nBy David Self \nRevisions by Michael Tolkin \nBased on the Novel by Shirley Jackson \nInitial Shooting Script \nNOTE: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERS. THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR THIS SOFT COPY. \nBEGIN MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE. \nAt the very edge of hearing, the tone of human VOICES. Unintelligible, babbling, eerie.  Then a loud FLAPPING SOUND.  It shifts from one side of the theater to the other, like something moving among the wall hangings. \nAs the TITLE appears, the noise mounts, drowning out the VOICES, agitated, becoming violent, banging... inhuman. \nFADE IN: \nEXT. HOUSING PROJECT, CHARLESTOWN, MASSACHUSETTS - DAY \nON a housing project in the industrial outskirts of Boston.  The BANGING seems to flutter away, leading us along, searching... to a tiny balcony, one of dozens, ten stories up.  And there, the source of the sound -- \n-- A SHEET, snapping in the wind.  The umbrella-like clothes line on which it hangs bangs against a dirty glass door as if trying to get in. \nTHROUGH THE GLASS DOOR a woman paces inside, agitated.  The VOICES rise over the banging, becoming intelligible -- \nINT. LIVING ROOM, NELL'S APARTMENT - DAY \n-- becoming a fight.  JANE, 30s, dark-haired, furious, wheels across a diminutive, neat, but poor living room. \nJANE It'll take a month to probate the will, Nell!  A month!  Even if Mother left you something, you won't get it in time to pay the rent.  So instead of complaining, you should be thanking Lou for getting you these two weeks to get Mother's things packed. \nAt first we can't even see who she's yelling at.  At first we don't even notice her.  Then we do... \nHolding herself, in a dim corner away from the light, small, plain, like a part of the faded room is ELEANOR VANCE, 20's -- Nell. She stares at the door.  The clothes line raps at the begrimed glass. \nJANE (cont'd) Nell? \nThe wind dies, the banging stops.  Nell seems to hear Jane and peers over at her, then across the room to Jane's bored husband, LOU.  He's turning a Franklin Mint commemorative coin set in his hands, studying it. \nLOU You're still going to have to settle with your mother's landlord on the back rent. \nNell watches Jane's little boy, RICHIE.  Unpacified by the cartoons on the TV, he plows a plastic tank across a shelf through neat rows of delicate PORCELAIN DOLLS. \nNELL I'm not going to stay.  I'll get a job.  I'll get my own apartment. \nRichie knocks a porcelain DOLL off, and it breaks all over the carpet.  His parents don't notice.  But Nell feels it in the soul. Richie stops.  A long beat.  He looks at her, insolent, then plows on with his tank. \nJANE Nell.  A job?  Two months and where is this job?  You have no degree, you've never worked -- \nNell explodes in outraged fury, startling us. \nNELL -- I've never worked? -- \nJANE You have no experience in the world... the regular world.  What would you put on a resume? (beat, softening) Now we all appreciate what you did for Mother.  Isn't that right, Lou? \nLOU Eleven years.  Long time. \nJANE That's why we've been talking. With me getting more time in Accessories, and Lou at the shop all day, we need somebody to take care of Richie, do a little cleaning and cooking.  And in return you can have the extra room. \nShe goes to Lou, puts a hand on his shoulder, proud of her generosity.  All Nell can do is stare. \nAnd then: KNOCK KNOCK.  Like a shot Nell is out of the chair and turning for a set of FRENCH DOORS across the room.  It's all reflex.  Nell catches herself. \nKNOCK KNOCK.  Richie, lying on the couch like he's sick, raps on the wall with a wooden CANE and squeals: \nRICHIE Eleanor, help me!  I've got to pee! \nNell REACTS, but rather than being amused or annoyed, a wave of TRAUMA flickers over her face.  The reaction is so strong we instantly know something is very wrong. \nLOU Richie, knock it off before I beat the crap out of you! \nNell turns away, sick, breathing hard. \nJane picks up a JEWELRY BOX from a dresser. \nJANE You're sure this is all of Mother's jewelry?  The lawyer said to make sure we took it to him... (beat) He said there might be some antique pieces.  Have you seen anything?  Some of it might be valuable. \nNell knows what is going to happen to that jewelry.  Jane no longer can bear the weight of Nell's stare, checks her watch.  She nods at Lou.  Lou rises, pocketing the coin set.  Richie follows him out. \nJANE (cont'd) Think about our offer, Nell.  You don't know how hard it is out there. \nINT. NELL'S KITCHEN - DAY \nNell rams through the door into the small kitchen, spotless, empty. And then bursts into tears.  Shaking, she digs in her back pocket and pulls out a FINE FILIGREE NECKLACE.  Her mother's.  It's from an age gone by. \nMARROW No. \nMALCOLM I, I just can't... \nMARROW She needed a job, Malcolm.  And she's smart.  And she helps me. \nMALCOLM I have a bad feeling about what you're doing. \nMARROW This is the last chapter.  Please, please give me clearance.  It's for science. \nMarrow waits. \nMALCOLM I'm gonna hate myself for this. \nBut he nods.  Permission granted. \nMARROW Thank you. \nINT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE LAB - DAY \nThey open the door.  They walk out.  Mary is there.  She closes her eyes, and does a gypsy voice. \nMARY I see a hostile man... he's (she describes him).  The hostile man does not believe in Madame Velka. \nThis relieves the pressure.  Malcolm is not listening anymore and storms off. \nMARY You know what he's really upset about? \nMARROW What? \nMARY You're going to publish, he's going to perish... And why did you hire me for this? \nMarrow has a sly smile.  They go into his office through another door in the lab. \nINT. MARROW'S OFFICE - DAY \nLong, narrow, badly lit, it's filled with filing cabinets, stacks of unread textbooks still in publisher's plastic, a desk with computer.  As soon as they enter, Mary looks at the phone. \nMARY It's for you. \nAnd then the phone rings.  He doesn't pick it right up, he lets it ring. \nMARROW You hear the vibrations in the wire.  There's a magnetic pulse in the wires, you feel it.  I could test it. \nMARY Test it. \nThe phone still rings.  Marrow answers. \nMARROW Yes, this is Doctor Marrow. \nMARY How'd I know it was for you? \nMARROW (quickly) Because it's my phone. (back to the phone) Yes... Mrs. Dudley, just leave the boxes inside, thank you.  See you soon.  Thank you. \nHe hangs up. \nMarrow is trying to read the first file as he goes to his desk. Mary shows him a huge CORKBOARD covered with photos, articles, and various items. \nMARY Here's how they're organized. Groups of five, very different personalities: scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.  And they all score high on the insomnia charts. \nMARROW Good. \nA PHOTO OF NELL falls on the floor.  Marrow scoops it up.  He holds the photo of Nell up to Mary, and look at the written notes and studies the graphs that go with it. \nMARROW (cont'd) This is correct? \nMARY Her mother died two months ago. She says she really wants to do this.  I didn't know if it'd be taking advantage... \nMarrow considers the lonely image for a long moment and then looks at the graph of her test scores. \nMARROW (meaning the graph, not the face) What a beautiful profile.  How do you feel about her?  What does your intuition say? \nMary balks at his teasing. \nMARY I put my favorites on the top. \nMarrow continues to study the files. \nMARROW (OC) Okay... this one's good... Extrovert Feeler... Okay... This one I like, too... \nWe don't pay as much attention now to the cork board as to other images on the wall.  We find clinical-looking shots from Stanley Milgram's experiments: subjects appearing to scream in response to electrical shock. \nRows of weeping prisoners in the Stanford prison experiment. \nPhotos of victims crushed under the stands of a soccer stadium, the aftermath of a riot.  A picture of the Fuhrer before his mesmerized masses.  Mary opens a large envelope.  She takes out a photograph that we can't see. \nMARY What's this? (has to get his attention) What's this... this picture? \nMARROW That?  That's Hill House. \nINT. NELL'S CAR - DAY \nNell looks out at the forest, feels a chill.  The road is more like a tunnel through the forest than a road. \nEXT. HILLS - DAY \nNell's car speeds through the trees, climbing the hills, higher and higher into the awesome solitude. \nINT. NELL'S CAR - DAY \nNell takes a final switchback, and something off to the right catches her eye, then is gone in the trees.  She watches again for it.  There.  A glimpse of a gray stone property wall set back twenty yards from the road. \nThere it is again.  Moss-greened, twenty feet high, a wicked array of iron spikes and glass mortared atop it. \nAnd then out of the tangled forest in front of her looms a pair of immense stone pillars.  Between them, a steel GATE as high as the wall, chained and padlocked. \nEXT. HILL HOUSE GATE - DAY \nThe gate stands immense.  Silent.  Forbidding.  Beyond them a gravel drive curves away through the trees.  Nell kills her car, gets out, instructions in hand.  No one in sight.  A long beat. She reaches in and blows the HORN. \nThe HORN shatters the air, rackets off the trees beyond the gate, echoing.  Silence. \nNell blows the HORN a sustained staccato in annoyance.  The echo replies in a terrible, deafening battering of sound.  Nell covers her ears.  Silence once again. \nIn a fit of agitation she goes to the padlock and rattles it.  It's locked good.  She turns -- \n-- and there is a man right behind her.  It is MR. DUDLEY, his hair tied back like an ex-hippie.  He stands between Nell and her open car door, weed spear in hand.  He smiles at her -- rough, dirty, massive. \nMR. DUDLEY What do you want? \nNELL Oh!  You scared me. \nMR. DUDLEY Me?  No.  What are you doing here? \nNELL Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker? \nMR. DUDLEY Yeah, I'm Mister Dudley, the caretaker.  What are you doing here? \nNELL I'm with Dr. Marrow's group.  I'm supposed to check in with Mrs. Dudley up at the house.  Is she here? \nShe hands him the directions.  He glances at them.  She uses the distraction to get into her car. \nMR. DUDLEY Maybe she is... \nINT. NELL'S CAR - DAY \nNell looks at the gate, some part of her aware it's a point of no- return.  Mr. Dudley eases over to her window.  Mr. Dudley gives her one last look and goes to the gate.  He produces a keyring and undoes the padlock. \nNELL Why do you need a chain like that? \nMR. DUDLEY That's a good question.  What is it about fences?  Sometimes a locked chain makes people on both sides of the fence just a little more comfortable.  Why would that be? \nHe unwinds the enormous chain, heavy turn after heavy turn.  The gates swing in, revealing HILL HOUSE. \nNELL Is there something about the house? \nMR. DUDLEY Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you. \nGrinning, Dudley steps aside and Nell rolls through.  And at that he just grins wider.  Nell pulls away.  Disturbed, she watches him in the rearview mirror.  She turns and in front of her sprawls Hill House.  At center, the features of the oldest part of the House dwarf all others: towering, eye-like windows and the jaws of a Grand Entry with carved ebony doors. \nEXT. HILL HOUSE DRIVEWAY - DAY \nThe car rumbles up the drive toward the carport. \nINT. NELL'S CAR - DAY \nNell stops the car in front of the entrance, right inside the carport.  In the silence all we can hear is her breathing. \nEXT. HILL HOUSE - DAY \nHer car sits in front of the house, tiny, alone.  Its brake lights go off. \nThe finger-like pillars of the car port seem like a hand pinning the car in place under the House's gaze. \nNell gets out of the car. \nNell stares, daunted... yet there is something about the House.  A romance in its lilac heavy Gothic decay.  Nell feels it, is drawn to it. \nEXT. GRAND ENTRY - DAY \nNell, suitcase in hand, climbs the steps to the front doors.  On closer inspection, the snaking shapes of the carved doors depict a Garden of Eden.  At center on the knocker, a tarnished silver Adam takes the forbidden fruit from his counterpart Eve. \nNell lifts Adam and knocks heavily.  There is no answer.  Nell looks around for some sign of life. \nOff to one side is a LADDER and PAINT CANS.  Somebody must've been touching up the window trim. \nWhen she looks back the door is AJAR a fraction of an inch. \nNELL Hello?  Hello?  Mrs. Dudley?  Mrs. Dudley, are you here?  Anybody? \nNELL Well, I've never lived with beauty.  You must love working here. \nMrs. Dudley peers at her.  A beat.  And then, cryptic: \nMRS. DUDLEY It's a job.  I keep banker's hours.  I set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six.  You can serve yourselves.  Breakfast is ready at nine.  I don't wait on people.  I don't stay after dinner.  Not after it begins to get dark.  I leave before dark comes.  We live in town.  Nine miles.  So there won't be anyone around if you need help.  We couldn't even hear you, in the night. \nNELL Why would we -- \nMRS. DUDLEY -- no one could.  No one lives any nearer than town.  No one will come any nearer than that.  In the night.  In the dark. \nAnd with that Mrs. Dudley grins, rictus-like.  She turns and closes the door after her. \nNell stands there a long moment, the room silent, heavy, old.  She goes to the windows, peers out.  Nothing but forest for miles.  The sun is setting. \nNell removes her windbreaker, opens her suitcase, takes out a blouse and skirt.  Decent enough clothes, but cheap, the tags still on them. \nINT. 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY, NORTH WING - DAY \nNell emerges from her room in her new clothes.  The hallway curves away into the distance, lined with massive, ornate doorframes like the one to her room. \nTrying to get a better look, Nell searches the walls for a light switch, but can't find one.  She follows the chair rail back to -- \nINT. MEZZANINE - SUNSET (CONTINUOUS) \n-- the mezzanine at the top of the stairs.  She searches in vain for a light switch there.  Finally she spots a set of curtains and slings them open. \nThe light, late-day though it is, makes her wince.  The window looks down on the driveway.  Outside a BEIGE CAR crunches over the gravel.  Somebody else has arrived. \nNell watches the car move past, trying to get a glimpse of the driver, but from up here, all she can see is roof. \nNELL Finally. \nShe backs away from the window, spins around -- \n-- and out of the darkness, powerful, mad, looms the visage of Hugh Crain.  It is the painting.  It is only from up here on the second floor with this curtain open that the FACE is visible in the late- day sunlight. \nDespite the artist's discretion, the lines in the man's skin, his eyes, his posture, cry of unspeakable sickness. \nUnconsciously, Nell takes a step back.  In the far b.g., near the end of one of the halls, a DOOR stands open, the second or third set of doors in the Gothic Hallway left of the painting.  Just as it starts to come into view, and we're starting to see it, it swings silently shut. \nBut Nell has caught the movement out of the corner of her eye. \nINT. 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY, NORTH WING - DAY \nNell stares down the long hallway.  Which door was it? \nNELL Hello? \nNo response.  She starts down the hall, slow at first, then faster. \nShe passes door after door, shadow after shadow, and as she nears the end of the hall... there is no door here.  Not within 20 feet of, where we thought we just saw it. \nA WHISPER.  VOICES.  Nell backs away.  And then LAUGHTER.  Behind her.  It's coming from another stairwell.  Very real... and very human. \nINT. BACK STAIRWAY - DAY \nNell looks down from the top of the stairs.  Below Mrs. Dudley and THEO, 20s, exotic, sophisticated, in Vera Wang leather, wrestle with a pile of designer luggage.  Theo peers up.  She's dark, sexy in an amused, worldly way: someone who has seen and done it all. \nTHEO You may think I have a sickness about packing, but asking people to help me shlep the stuff I take with me everywhere is a cheap and exploitative way of making new friends.  My name's Theo. \nTheo foists a very heavy bag off on Mrs. Dudley who looks like she's been handed a snake.  That makes Nell smile.  She comes running down to help with the bags. \nNELL I'm Eleanor but everyone calls me Nell.  Eleanor Vance.  Nell.  I'm really glad you're here.  Really. \nTheo is a little thrown by Nell's gushing. \nNELL (cont'd) What a beautiful jacket. \nTheo looks her over... and understands.  Nell is desperate to be liked. \nTHEO And what you're wearing, that's great, too. \nNELL This?  It's from a thrift shop. \nTHEO What did it cost? \nNELL Fifteen dollars. \nTHEO That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it! \nNELL (embarrassed by the simple truth) It's all I could afford. \nTHEO Wait.  You're not wearing that ironically?  This is really you? \nNELL I don't know what you mean. \nMrs. Dudley, walking ahead, looks back at them.  Then continues up. Theo makes a face at Mrs. Dudley's back.  Nell smiles, a little. \nTHEO A week.  You and I?  We're going to have fun. \nINT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nA chandelier hangs unlit over a long dining table.  LAUGHTER.  At the end Nell and the others sprawl over the remains of a dinner which has been going on for hours.  Luke is opening another bottle of jug wine. \nLUKE You know what I love about wine that comes in bottles like this? \nTODD What? \nLUKE Every year is a good year. \nMARROW Theo?  It's your turn. \nTheo twirls her wine glass, licks the dregs inside the rim, thinking. \nTHEO The rest of you may hate your insomnia, but I find it the best time of the day for me.  I'm alone.  Nobody's talking to me but myself.  My mind is racing with ideas, and I can think. \nLUKE Nah, you're going crazy with doubt, all of your mistakes are coming back up the pipes, and it's worse than a nightmare. -- \nNell isn't used to people being so direct and at the same time, playful.  She glances at Marrow's LEFT HAND: NO WEDDING RING. \nTHEO (cont'd) Excuse me. \nLUKE Don't give me that look, it's everybody's problem, we just have different variations, I for example.  I fall asleep easily. But I wake up around two or three in the morning, every morning. It's that time of night that Fitzgerald called the deep dark night of the soul.  I stare into... the abyss.  Every night. (breaks his own somber mood) It's the price I pay for being such a jolly fellow. (to Mary) Y usted? \nMARY I think I'd fall asleep easily, but just as I start to feel comfortable, I see things in the dark. \nNell hears this, Nell is tuned into Mary. \nMARY I feel the presence of something watching me.  It's not... scary... not by itself but... I don't want to go to sleep because I'm worried about the thing attacking me.  So when I finally do fall asleep, I'm like a soldier who's fallen asleep at her post.  I feel like I've betrayed myself.  Nell? \nNell wishes she could hide under her plate. \nNELL All of you have such interesting problems. \nThere's laughter. \nNELL (cont'd) No... Please, I know how that sounds but... You're all so articulate.  You know how to talk. I feel like I'm here under false pretenses.  It's silly, it's not like... well, all of you have trouble sleeping because you live in the world, and the world is complicated and scary, but nothing's ever happened to me.  So I don't have a reason to sleep badly. \nMARROW You wrote that you had trouble sleeping. \nNELL Yes, because someone was always keeping me awake.  Ever since I was little.  That was my job.  I took care of my mother and I had to be there for her all night long, and she woke up all the time.  And after she died, well, it's been a few months, but I still, I still wake up, it's... a habit. (beat) I know we've only known each other a couple of hours, but I'm really glad to be with people who let me talk about this.  I'm really happy to be here with you. \nSilence.  The others are embarrassed by her sincerity.  She's right, Nell is not of their world. \nMARROW We're glad you're here. \nHe says this with enough sympathy for Theo to see his interest in the girl in the thrift shop dress. \nMARROW (cont'd) Why don't we move to another room? \nINT. RED PARLOR - NIGHT \nThe HARP sings out, lively, expertly played by Mary.  Theo, Luke, Todd and Nell are impressed with her skill. \nMARY It's an Erard.  Late 1870s. \nShe plays, and as she does, she's aware of the room, and the house, and she sees something in a curtain or the fireplace, or a window, something at the edge of perception.  She suddenly stops. \nNELL What's wrong? \nMARY The harp is out of tune. \nShe finds a key and begins TIGHTENING the strings -- as Marrow bangs open the door, briefcase in one hand, CELL PHONE in the other.  He can't conceal his irritation.  Marrow removes folders from his briefcase, passes them around while she plays.  Nell again studies the Cherub of Death on the spine of the leather bound books. \nMARROW I'll have to count David Watts as a no-show.  So let's start.  Thank you, Mary. \nThat was a little abrupt, she feels it.  Everybody finds a chair or spot on the sofa.  Mary remains on the stool by the harp.  Marrow sits in a large winged-back chair. \nMARROW (cont'd) All right?  So, to answer your earlier question, Todd, why are we here?  What do we all need in life, what are the basics?  We need food, we need water, we need sleep.  Sleep.  All of you resist it?  Why?  What does that mean? Why do we resist sleep?  My field of study is the individual's psychology of emotion and performance. \nLUKE So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test? \nMARROW I thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't so pleasant you'd all sleep too easily.  You'll be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you've got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company. \nTHEO When do we take the tests? \nMARROW Every day.  Basically we'll be hanging out together like we have so far this evening. \nNell and Theo are looking through their folders: sheets of paper, bizarre geometric puzzles. \nMARROW Also, there is no phone service to the House and no TV.  I have the cell phone for emergencies.  We'll begin the tests after breakfast tomorrow. \nThe others shuffle through papers, Nell and Todd intent on them, Theo interested but not overly so, Luke, bored. \nMARY Dr. Marrow, what is this house? \nWhen she says this, we should be seeing her from an odd perspective, the house's POV. \nMARROW (cont'd) There was once a king who built a palace.  The King's name was Hugh Crain.  A hundred and thirty years ago, when the Merrimack Valley was the center of American industry, Hugh Crain made two hundred million dollars.  That's forty- three billion dollars in today's money.  He could have anything he wanted.  And what he wanted, was Rene, his banker's beautiful daughter.  Rene, and a house filled with children. \nLUKE He's trying to protect the experiment.  Personally, I don't think he's got a large enough sample for valid results, but as long as the money's good, and the food is good, I'm in. \nHe heads off.  Theo turns to find Nell staring at the animal heads on the stairs.  Theo touches her.  She starts. \nTHEO Nell, it was an accident. \nINT. MARROW'S BEDROOM (PART OF CONFUSING ROOMS) - NIGHT \nMarrow, sitting at a desk, speaks into a digital voice recorder. His voice is cold, analytical. \nMARROW Icebreaker exercise conducted over dinner.  Observed initial bonding among subjects and experimenter. After dinner first bland history of House relayed.  Nell appears most susceptible to suggestive history.  Luke, who tested at the bottom of the Levy-Mogel Confidence Reliability Scale was given the second part of the story.  We should see some results tomorrow.  Accident with harp, while unfortunate... complements the experimental fiction. \nHe turns off the machine, and then he says, ruefully: \nMARROW (cont'd) Publish or perish. \nHe turns off the light.  The shadows in the room are too much for him. He turns the light on, and then pulls the blanket over his head. \nINT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT \nNell finishes putting things away in drawers.  Theo watches, leaning in the doorway.  Nell looks around at the room: and this is her new family's new home.  Theo smiles sweetly at her, comes over.  An awkward moment, as the seriousness drains away. \nTHEO Ever try putting your hair up in a French twist? \nTheo reaches for Nell's hair.  Nell pulls away.  Theo pauses.  Nell realizes she shouldn't have pulled back. \nNELL Sorry.  I'm not used to being touched. \nShe moves closer to let Theo examine her hair.  Theo takes Nell's hair, holds it up in a French twist. \nTHEO You've been out of the world for a long time, haven't you? \nNELL Yes.  I've missed it. \nTHEO No.  The world has missed you. \nCautiously, Nell peers in a mirror at herself... and likes what she sees.  Theo lets Nell's hair drop.  Theo moves for the door. \nNELL Good night, Theo. \nTHEO You, too.  Happy tossing and turning. \nINT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT \nAs Nell steps OUT OF FRAME and starts undressing, the CAMERA finds the carved mantle, the densely-packed scene of children at play, their faces frozen in dark wooden smiles, their eyes blind but staring OC where we sense Nell changing. \nNow in a long tee-shirt, Nell crawls up onto the high bed.  Its headboard is heavy, dark, engraved with fan-like shapes, maybe plants. \nShe draws the covers about her and peers up at the ornate headboard. \nSomething about it bothers Nell, but she can't put her finger on it. She twists over on her side and turns out the light on the nightstand. For a moment, all there is in the darkness is her breathing -- \nINT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT \n-- then almost silence.  We pull back from the CHILDREN'S FACES on the doors of the Great Hall to reveal the vast room standing in darkness.  Covens of strange shapes consort in the shadows, things that in the day would be lamps, the stuff of life.  But now, at the very deepest limit of human hearing, it is as if SOMETHING EXHALES. \nINT. GRAND STAIRWAY - NIGHT \nIt is black at the top of the stairs.  The carved animal heads on the balusters are all turned UP THE STAIRWAY, eyes starting in fear. Waiting for something to walk down out of that blackness. \nINT. HALL OUTSIDE LOCKED ROOM - NIGHT \nEyes.  Eyes of all the mythological figures.  STARING down the long, black hallway.  Awaiting something.  Afraid. \nAt the end of the hallway, where all eyes are staring, the double doors, the ones that scared Nell and Theo stand shut. \nThat something gathering at the edge of our hearing RISES.  Rises as if the House itself is breathing. \nINT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT \nBUMP.  The sound thuds the stillness of the House.  Bump.  Bump. Bump.  Deep, hollow, distant like a dream.  Nell sits up, still asleep, body moving by reflex. \nNELL Coming, Mother! \nWHUMP.  The noise jars her consciousness, lighting up her mind, VERY REAL.  Nell remembers where she is. \nBump bang.  It's coming from somewhere far off in the House.  Nell listens in cold dread. \nTHEO (OC) Nell! \nNell spins to the bathroom door, goes through -- \nINT. NELL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) \n-- the unlit bathroom, slamming the door to her room behind her, across and out the other door -- \nINT. THEO'S ROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) \n-- into Theo's room.  THUMP BUMP BUMP.  Nell finds Theo right in front of her, hair wet, kneeling in the bed, clutching her covers to herself. \nVARIOUS SHOTS as the bumping seems to travel down the hallway.  A rushing sound with it.  They're the same sounds, from the scene before, but somehow have none of the impact, none of the presence as they did in Theo's bedroom. \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nLuke lets the door shut, turns off the faucet.  The sounds of the plumbing die away. \nLUKE Do you need me anymore?  Cause I'm going to bed.  They can stay up talking another 45 minutes if they want, but I gotta try to get some sleep. \nMARROW Go ahead. \nLuke leaves the kitchen.  Theo and Nell watch him go. \nTHEO If this was some sort of joke, I'm going to kill him. \nNELL You know it wasn't a joke, Theo. \nMarrow watches the exchange closely. \nMARROW The cold sensation.  Who felt it first? \nNELL Theo I think.  You've asked us that three times, Doctor Marrow. What's going on? \nMARROW How do you feel about Luke's suggestion that it was just the old plumbing?  Water hammer, something like that? \nTheo and Nell look at each other in frustration.  But Theo tries to get her mind around the question. \nTHEO I did just take a bath.  I don't know. \nINT. THEO'S ROOM - NIGHT \nThe room is a lot less frightening now, especially with the lights on.  Nell sits on Theo's bed.  Theo looks at the walls, silent, normal. \nTHEO I did just take a bath. \nWhen Nell doesn't respond for a moment, Theo turns to her, sees her wrestling with herself. \nNELL Mother always banged on the wall when she needed me.  The night she died... I heard her, but I pretended I didn't.  I was just so sick of it all.  And then the banging stopped.  And in the morning... she was dead.  This is the first I've ever said this to anyone.  That was the job I had, Theo, it's the only job I've ever known, and I failed.  I'm actually a bad person, Theo.  The world doesn't need me. \nTheo shakes her head, brushes at her eyes.  The confession, on the top of the fright, has moved her deeply. \nTHEO Oh, Nell.  Eleven years.  With all due respect to your mother who I'm sure was a saint, I'd have called Doctor Kevorkian, if not for her, for me. \nIt's such a horrible thought it makes Nell smile, and they share a tearful laugh. \nINT. NELL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT \nNell stands in the door to her room. \nNELL Good night, Theo. \nNell shuts the door.  Theo is about to close her door, but hesitates.  She puts on the light and goes to the tub.  She turns it on, waits.  Just the sound of the water.  And no bumping. \nINT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT \nNell lies asleep under her sheet, the blankets off the end of the bed.  HOVERING OVER HER, on the headboard, the carved faces of children, peering DOWN. \nFLAP.  FLAP flap.  The fan-light at the top of the window right next to the bed is OPEN a crack.  The sheer curtains flap listlessly in a gentle breeze.  The flapping grows louder, and with a sudden gust the curtain BILLOWS OUT.  In its flowing form, we sense the SHAPE OF A GIRL'S FACE, fleeting, so insubstantial we know we just saw her, but maybe our eyes are playing tricks on us. \nThe CURTAIN blows straight out, touching the bedposts at the foot of the bed, and there the wind catches the fabric hanging from them. The Wind seem to sneak under the bedcover and the shape follows... \nNell sleeps, oblivious, the WIND filling the room, stirring the tinkling crystal beads on the candelabra.  The shape of the little girl's face now travels underneath the bedsheets toward the pillows, toward Nell. \nNell turns, restless, the AIR catches the edge of the pillowcase, and travels towards Nell's face.  And for a split second there is a lifelike IMPRESSION OF A SMALL GIRL'S FACE.  Nell almost awakens. The crystal beads stir, and in their tinkling, in the sigh of wind, we hear: \nGIRL VOICE Find us, find us Eleanor. \nNell's eyes open.  And like that, the pillowcase deflates, the air rushes up the curtain to the window, and is gone. \nNell sits up, looks about her.  Everything seems normal.  Just her sheets, just the curtains, but on the headboard remain the carved faces.  Benevolent.  Nell settles back down on her pillow with a sense of peace. \nINT. DINING ROOM - DAY \nMorning sun filters in through heavy drapes, falling on Marrow at the dining table.  Nell squeezes behind him and the sideboard behind him to get at the coffee.  Nell wears MAKE UP, badly applied, and her HAIR IS UP in a French twist. \nNELL Sorry. \nMARROW For an American you do a good imitation of the British at their most apologetic. (Veddy British) Pardon me.  Excuse me, sorry, sorry... \nNell smiles.  Theo walks in the door, sees Nell and Marrow, Nell squeezed in behind him. \nNELL Am I that bad? \nTheo is aware of Marrow's curiosity and fascination with Nell. There's a jealousy brewing. \nTHEO Well this is a cozy breakfast. \nMARROW Good morning, Theo.  Luke. \nLuke comes in behind Theo, tired-looking also.  He goes to the sideboard, starts helping himself to breakfast. \nNELL Jim... \nMarrow sticks his head into the fireplace.  For a long moment, nothing happens. \nIN THE FIREPLACE: pitch darkness.  Marrow feels up the chimney. \nAND THEN SOMETHING SWINGS DOWN RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIS FACE!  Marrow doesn't flinch. \nHe FLINGS back the screen, revealing the only things in the fireplace: two massive andirons, and the still-swinging FLUE.  It's cast-iron, forged in the shape of a LION'S HEAD. \nLuke throws back the other screen.  Theo comes over.  Nell follows. There's nothing else in the fireplace. \nLuke and Theo stare at Nell.  Marrow squats to study the hearth. The large iron ASH-DROP is coated in soot. \nNot a mark on it.  He opens it.  Inside, a glimpse of ASHES and CHARRED WOOD.  Marrow stands, looks at Nell. \nNELL (cont'd) Somebody was in here.  I saw him. \nMarrow looks at her, not sure what to believe.  Nell turns to Luke and Theo for help.  Not from that corner.  Then Nell remembers, reaches into her pocket and produces the KEYS.  She holds them up to Luke. \nNELL (cont'd) Are these yours?  I found them right over there. \nLUKE Who drives a Toyota? \nTheo shakes her head.  They aren't Marrow's.  Marrow takes the keys from Nell, turns them over. \nTHEO Maybe they're Mary's. \nMARROW Mary came with me. \nNELL When I first got here I saw a gray car pull up.  I thought it was one of us. \nEXT. HILL HOUSE - DAY \nThey stand on the front steps.  Nell's car is right there under the car port. \nNELL This is my car. \nTheo gestures to a sports car on the circular drive.  Two other cars are with it.  They walk out into the driveway. \nMARROW And those are Luke's and mine. \nLUKE There's a carriage house around back. \nEXT. CARRIAGE HOUSE - DAY \nTogether they approach a stable/carriage house off to one side of the main House.  It looks old, unused.  They enter through a small door. \nINT. CARRIAGE HOUSE - DAY \nLight filters in through gaps in the wood.  Luke opens one of the main doors with a loud SQUEAK, the sun revealing a TARP-COVERED SHAPE, a carriage.  Unused in a hundred years.  A row of tarp- covered carriages fill the stalls into the distance. \nLUKE Well, this lot is full! \nTHEO He must have left.  Didn't like the looks of the place or something. \nNELL How could he have left without his keys? \nTHEO Two sets.  I don't know.  Maybe they're not even his. \nLUKE Then he's got to be in the house... \nAs they leave, the CAMERA LINGERS on a covered shape in one of the stalls, SMALLER than the other carriages, it could be a car.  A broken wagon wheel leaning against it. \nINT. STATUARY HALL AND SHORT MONTAGE THROUGH HOUSE - DAY \nMarrow, Theo and Luke move down the hall, opening doors left and right as Nell stands at the center of it all. \nMARROW Watts! \nNo answer.  The statuary peers down on Nell.  Dead faces on busts. Blind marble eyes. \nINT. VARIOUS ROOMS AND HALLS - DAY \nLuke calls out. \nLUKE Watts!  Oh Watts!  Here Wattsy... \nINT. VARIOUS ROOMS AND HALLS - DAY \nMarrow is looking for him, too. \nMARROW Watts!  Can you hear us? \nINT. VARIOUS ROOMS AND HALLS - DAY \nNell and Theo, walking into rooms. \nTHEO Watts? \nMARROW Hmm. \nNELL I'm sorry.  I'm messing up the study. \nMARROW No you're not.  Something moved you.  You saw something. \nNell looks to him.  He's sincere.  He believes her. \nNELL I don't know.  Maybe I... \n\"Didn't\" she almost says.  She struggles, embarrassed. \nNELL (cont'd) I haven't been with people in a long time. \nMarrow settles in his chair, looks out at the forest. \nMARROW I really haven't either. \nNell peers at him, doubtful.  Is she being made fun of? \nMARROW (cont'd) I mean, I'm surrounded by people, day in, dayout.  Students, colleagues. (beat) But most of the time, even when I'm with them... you know... It's all about power, there's not much room for actually getting to know someone or having someone getting to know you. \nNell's face flushes with compassion.  With longing.  Marrow looks at her.  He's vulnerable.  Needing.  She doesn't dare hope.  The moment lasts a few heartbeats. \nHe looks away.  A flicker of distress crosses Nell's face.  And then she realizes Marrow is looking at -- \n-- Luke. \nLUKE (cont'd) You have to see something. \nINT. GRAND STAIRWAY - DAY \nLuke, Nell and Marrow mount the stairs, climb up and up.  They find Theo in the mezzanine staring at the wall at the painting.  She turns and looks at Nell strangely. \nNell, confused, turns around.  On the wall and the painting are dark stains.  Black.  Blue.  Runny.  Almost like something leaking from the roof has run down. \nNell steps back.  The stains are the letters N and O.  Pulling back farther: the rest of the word ELEANOR. \nNELL My name. \nShe follows the streaking substance up, blinking in rising fear as more running letters appear.  The word: WELCOME.  And higher up, the last: HOME. \nNELL (cont'd) No... \nBut the substance doesn't come from the ceiling. \nIt is as if the oils on the PAINTING OF HUGH CRAIN have been boiled by a heat gun and blasted off, running down from there.  Hugh's face is gone.  In place of the face, the underlying ivory of the canvas glares out... like a skull. \nNell SCREAMS and runs away, the others calling out after her in alarm.  As they vanish around the corner, the camera tilts down and we discover smeared paint on the floor.  Smeared, it seems, WITH LITTLE FOOTPRINTS in it. \nINT. RED PARLOR - DAY \nNell, panic rising in her voice, confronts the others. \nNELL Welcome Home Eleanor.  Welcome Home?  I've never been here.  Who did this? \nLUKE It's somebody's idea of a joke. \nShe looks at all three of them. \nNELL Who did this?  Why are you doing this?  I don't know any of you. You don't know me.  Why are you doing this to me? \nLuke shakes his head.  Theo starts getting pissed.  Marrow stands there, arms folded, observing. \nLUKE I didn't do it. \nTHEO You could have. \nLUKE So could you!  Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting? \nTHEO No. \nNELL Theo... Did you? \nTHEO Maybe you did it yourself. \nNELL Why? \nTHEO I don't know.  You've been alone for a long time, maybe you want attention. (pointing to Marrow) Maybe he did it... \nMARROW I didn't.  You know that, Nell. \nThis is horrifying to Nell, being doubted and accused of something so ugly if it were true. \nNELL I don't know anything.  Whoever did this, please, just... just say so... just... please... this is cruel.  Don't be cruel to me.  I can't stand it.  You don't know me. \nAnd she runs out. \nNell grabs for the door to leave. \nTheo finishes Nell's last little toe, and then with the brush out of paint, runs it gently up the inside of Nell's calf.  Nell sighs. \nTheo lowers her face near Nell's toes, licks her lips: soft, near, red.  She blows. \nNell raises herself up, peers down at Theo.  Sees the want on her face.  A long beat. \nNell breaks the gaze, looks away.  Theo reads Nell's look, and releases her foot.  She sits back in the chair.  For a moment Nell doesn't know what to do. \nNELL (cont'd) I better go to bed. \nTHEO Are you sure? \nNELL I think so. \nTHEO Okay. \nINT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT \nNell closes the door and sits at the vanity brushing out her hair for bed.  Her motions are languid in the light of the single small lamp, off-balance with the wine. \nHer HAIR brushes out in long, even strokes.  The brush moves through it, lifting it and letting it fall. \nIN THE MIRROR the brush draws through Nell's hair, but as it does, the hair divides in its wake LIKE FINGERS RUNNING THROUGH it. \nNell freezes.  She's not sure what she just saw.  She runs the brush through again, and again it is as if something pulls it back from her head. \nAgain -- fast -- she runs the brush through her hair, and this time the hair SPINS UP IN A KNOT. \nNell flinches, dropping the brush, knocking the shade of the lamp on the vanity a-wobbling. \nShe's out of the chair in a flash, grabbing her own hair, staring at the space behind her.  Nothing there.  A beat. \nShe steadies herself, feeling the alcohol.  Gets control. \nThe Tiffany lamp rocks back and forth, crystal beads shimmering. The light plays across the fireplace and mantle on the wall.  And something there catches her eye. \nNell feels her way across the room, not sure of what she's seeing. Over the sound of the wind outside, there's something at the very highest edge of hearing. \nShe stops five feet from the mantle.  The swaying light catches the rich tones of wood.  Then darkens.  Illuminates it again.  Darkens. The carvings of the playing CHILDREN in the wood SEEM TO MOVE. \nNell stares in drunken fascination.  And as the first fear begins to rise in her throat, the wind dies down and in its place there is the FAINTEST TRACE OF CHILDREN'S LAUGHTER.  Nell's reaction changes... to awe. \nTentative, her hand goes out, shaking... and touches the mantle. \nIt is hard and still.  No movement whatsoever.  Silence.  But the FACES engraved in the wood all seem to be peering up at her, hands outstretched for her, hopeful. \nEXT. HILL HOUSE GATES - NIGHT \nThe enormous LOCKED gates are silhouetted against the moonlit sky. The chain is dangling in the wind. \nEXT. HILL HOUSE - NIGHT \nHold on Nell's WINDOW, the light shining dim through the gauze curtain.  It goes out.  The window stares from an arrangement of other windows, stonework and doors... like an eye with a cataract in a face howling in horror. \nINT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT \nNell, her breathing heavy, lies tangled in her heavy blankets, asleep, but restless.  Her feet hang off the end of the bed. \nIn the b.g., the door to the bathroom is shut, barely visible in the faint light from the window.  HOLD on it. \nSilently, it begins to OPEN.  The gap WIDENS, yawning, pitch dark beyond.  A long beat.  And then a THUMP.  A SLIDING SOUND. Something drags itself across the floor. \nBUMP.  SLIDE.  Our line of sight is blocked by the bed.  But the sound is getting louder, coming closer. \nBump.  Slide.  Nell grinds her teeth in her sleep, pulls the blankets about her tighter.  Bump.  The sound stops.  And her BREATH BEGINS TO FOG. \nWhatever has just come in the room is right there, hovering just OC. We can feel it. \nWithout warning Nell BOLTS upright, GASPING into consciousness. REVEAL: nothing.  Just the dark room.  And the bathroom door OPEN. \nNell stares at the-door, knows she shut it.  Now it's open.  She breaths fast, feeling the cold, knowing something's in here with her. \nShe stops breathing, strains her ears.  Silence.  A long moment. Then she notices her feet, hanging out from under the covers. \nThey are black.  Feel slick.  Nell turns on the light by her bed and looks down. \nHER FEET ARE COVERED IN GORE.  Where Theo had been painting.  Nell SCREAMS. \nINT. NELL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT \nSCREAMING, Nell spins the tub faucets on full blast, sticks her feet into the spray. \nTHEO (OC) Nell?  Nell! \nWeeping, Nell scrubs the gore off her feet -- red, black like old clotted blood. \nNELL Who is doing this to me? \nThe door to Theo's bedroom is shut.  The handle rattles, urgent, but it won't open.  It's LOCKED. \nTheo is chilled by this answer which would only make sense to someone out of her mind. \nNell looks up and sees the double staircase at the end of the greenhouse... the one where Crain's wife killed herself. \nAnd for a moment we see Crain's wife hanging there and then the image is gone... \nINT. DINING ROOM - DAY \nLunch remains are on the table as Nell enters, test papers in hand. \nNELL Jim?  I'm done. \nBut Marrow isn't there.  She's about to go back out to look for him, but sees something and stops. \nForgotten by a reading chair to one side of the room.  Barely visible.  Marrow's BRIEFCASE.  Nell goes to the briefcase, knowing she shouldn't look, and unable to help herself.  Marrow's digital recorder glints out at her. \nNell takes it out, and presses play.  She looks up at the door.  Any minute he could come back in here... and then Marrow's voice rings out. \nMARROW (V.O.) ...the hallway discussion about last night's fireplace incident concluded at three a.m.  Nell continues her alienation of the other subjects and the experimenter.  It remains unclear whether she truly believes she did not deface the painting. Interview with the subject in greenhouse yesterday to ascertain the extent of her self-delusion was inconclusive due to her efforts to sexualize encounter with experimenter. \nMarrow's voice continues on in his assessment, but Nell isn't hearing anything anymore. \nShe dies inside.  Her world upside down.  She falls into a chair, and all we can hear of Marrow is the cold, analytical tone, his garbled jargon. \nMARROW (OC) One minute! \nIt's Marrow, for real, about to enter.  Nell clicks off the recorder, drops it into the briefcase.  Marrow is startled, not expecting Nell to be sitting right next to his papers and briefcase. \nMARROW (cont'd) Nell. \nShe can only stare at him, eyes dead.  Marrow looks from her to the briefcase and back. \nMARROW (cont'd) Were you looking for me? \nNell can't answer.  Marrow comes over, unsettled. \nMARROW (cont'd) How are the tests going? \nNell rises, staring, emotionless.  Betrayal just beginning to find a hold.  She hands him her papers.  Marrow looks at Nell, knows she's been in his briefcase.  He picks it up, and with a final, sorry glance, exits. \nINT. GROUND FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY \nNell emerges from the study, stands there a beat, lost.  Then she turns, resolute, and starts moving.  Faster. \nINT. GREAT HALL - DAY \nNell, blinded by tears, runs across the room toward the grand entry and the exit... and stops. \nDOWN THE CONNECTING HALL, out in the grand entry, at the front doors, are Mr. and Mrs. Dudley.  Leaving for the day.  They stop. Look at her. \nNell, numb, gazes from the open door to Mrs. Dudley.  Mr. Dudley holds the door open as if in invitation.  Nell could walk out right now.  This is her chance.  But... \nMrs. Dudley smiles a knowing smile.  An all too knowing smile.  And seeing Nell's decision, gently shuts the door.  The LOCK CLICKS. Final.  Fate-sealing. \nNell turns back to the House, lost. \nINT. RED PARLOR - DAY \nNell walks right up to the moveable bookcase and enters Crain's secret study. \nINT. CRAIN'S SECRET STUDY - DAY \nNell sits in silence, trying to find a feeling, any feeling.  A long beat.  And without warning she leaps to her feet in SHOCKING rage. \nNELL How can he think I'm doing this! \nShe has a floor lamp in her hands, and hurls it like a throwing hammer at the nearest shelves.  Vases, knickknacks and a LEATHER ALBUM crash to the floor. \nShe stalks around the room, and then slows, staring at what she's done, the rage draining out of her.  But if she could do something like that... \nNELL (cont'd) No.  No, I couldn't do those things: I'm not making it up. \nShe turns in place, desperate... and sees the old leather album precariously tilting on one of the sprung shelves.  It's open.  One of the leaves flips over on its own, gravity and the weight of its own pages TURNING IT. \nNell approaches, stepping over broken ceramic.  SLIP.  Another page turns. \nNell hovers over it, holding her breath so as not to make the book flip over and fall off the shelf in one instant. \nSLIP.  Another page turns.  The book is a PHOTO ALBUM of the late nineteenth century, bound with ribbons, the aged Daguerreotypes in pressed vellum frames. \nNell peers closer.  It's open to a faded, gray image taken long before it became the convention to smile for a photograph: a woman, RENE CRAIN, sitting in a chair. \nAnd standing behind the chair, a fearsome presence in a black coat, his face hollow, malevolent.  HUGH CRAIN. \nNell shivers, and SLIP, the page turns on its own. \nAn image of Hugh and Rene, a look of deathly loss on their faces. The page flips. \nCrain hovers, dark, rage just under the surface, but on Rene's face is the faintest, most inappropriate SMILE.  It sends a chill through Nell. \nINT. PICTURE GALLERY - DUSK \nNell bursts into the picture gallery and stops.  Standing there are Marrow, Theo and Luke, stricken silent by her entry.  Looks of shock on their faces.  Nell just stands there.  A beat.  And then it pours out of her, hysterical. \nNELL (cont'd) He hunted all those children in here.  The dead children, Josiah and Elizabeth and all of them... from the books... he took them up here... he played games... the ones from his mills he burned them up in the fireplace but she found out what he did and she killed him -- \nShe takes a breath, and turns gray.  Before anyone else can react, her legs go out from under her, and she lands sitting.  Theo and Marrow get to her side fast. \nNELL (cont'd) -- he didn't kill her she killed him and ran away with her baby -- \nMarrow grabs her face.  It's gray, her eyes glazing over. \nMARROW Get a blanket! \nTHEO It's okay... we're all here... \nLuke races out.  Theo, scared, looks at Marrow. \nTHEO (cont'd) What's happening to her? \nMARROW She's in shock.  Come on. \nHe starts to lift her.  Theo takes her other side. \nNELL After Rene... after she killed herself... he turned into a monster.  He did fill the house with children... he did, but... they weren't laughing... \nNell is ugly, sprawling, in shock, as Theo and Marrow shuffle her to a padded bench on one side of the room. \nTHEO Nell, what happened? \nNELL Carolyn showed me where she hid him, hid him with all the ones he killed -- \nMARROW Nell... please, Nell... take a deep breath... \nNELL And they're all locked together in here... and he won't let go of them! \nMarrow grabs her face. \nMARROW Nell! \nLuke rushes in with a blanket.  Theo covers Nell and then holds her, gently. \nMARROW (cont'd) Look at me, Nell.  Look at me! \nNell manages to focus on him, her breath laboring. \nNELL Hugh Crain.  He's in the house. He's still here... \nTheo pulls back, goes very still.  The first hint of fear in her eyes. \nTHEO No. \nMarrow sees the panic working on her, gives her a stern look: \nMARROW Theo!  You too.  Listen to me. \nThe command derails Theo's train of thought.  Marrow stares at Nell in pity, can't bear it, and has to look away.  Finally he turns back to her, full of regret. \nMARROW Nell, you have to hear me.  Let me explain what's happening to you. (beat) You're participating in a study on hysteria. \nEveryone but Marrow REACTS. \nMARROW (cont'd) I've given you a powerful suggestion that you're in a haunted house.  I picked Hill House because it fits the expectations.  It was my... it was my theater, my stage. \nTheo glances at Luke: he's been right all along.  This was never about perception. \nLUKE Modelling small-group dynamics in the formation of narrative hallucinations.  You brought us here to scare us.  Insomnia, that was just a decoy issue.  You're disgusting. \nNELL Is this true?  I've been hypnotized? \nMARROW I hadn't done a study of how group fear affects individual performance.  Mass hysteria is like a story, Nell.  A communal story.  Someone starts it.  Then we all add a little more to it. And then for some reason -- no one knows how -- we start believing it.  This story shapes what we see and hear.  We interpret everything through it, make it fit the story. I started our story when I gave you the history of Hill House. You've added to it.  That's what this experiment has all been about.  That's what it was about, the experiment's over.  I'm pulling the plug.  This is my fault. \nNELL It's not real?  Crain?  He's not real? \nMarrow shoots him a look: shut up. \nMARROW Your fear of him was real.  That's all the ghost anyone needs. \nTHEO How could you do this to people? \nNell bucks in his arms, furious, desperate. \nNELL This is real, I'm not making it up!  Theo, you saw it!  You were there -- the banging and last night.  You, you all saw the painting! \nTHEO Nell, it makes sense.  It all makes sense.  You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up. \nNELL -- but the painting! \nNobody says anythlng.  The silence tortures Nell. \nMarrow steps into the dark, vast room, his glasses glinting.  The faint outline of the fireplace on the far wall looms in the darkness. \nMarrow approaches it.  The mesh screen is still open.  Marrow stands there a moment.  Then looks in. \nHe squats and tries to open the ash-drop.  It doesn't budge; it's jammed by the poker Nell dropped in. \nMarrow considers, then shakes his head, feels stupid for even coming in to check. \nSuddenly his CELL PHONE RINGS, startling him. \nMARROW Shit. (answering the phone) Hello?  Yes, this is Dr. Marrow. (beat) Oh, hello.  Thank you for returning the call. (beat) No.  You mean he hasn't returned? (long beat) No, we haven't seen him. (beat) Can you tell me, what sort of car does he drive? (beat, reacting) A Toyota... \nINT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE KITCHEN - NIGHT \nLuke stops Theo, carrying a tray of food and tea, outside the kitchen door. \nTHEO We're fucked.  We're in a haunted house and we can't get out until the morning. \nLUKE You don't really believe it's haunted... Do you believe in ghosts? \nTHEO That depends on your definition of ghosts.  I'm going to check on her, and then I'm going to stay awake. \nLUKE All night? \nTHEO Yeah. \nLUKE You want company? \nTHEO Maybe someday. \nSome sexual awareness. \nINT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT \nNell lies in her bed asleep, the room dark except for the last, guttering end of one of the candles.  It goes out. \nA FAINT SOUND.  LONG, LOW, like the inarticulate murmur of a dozen madmen.  Nell stirs.  Her eyes open.  She hears the sound. \nThe wall on the opposite side of the room catches the pale gloom from the window.  The twisting figures in the plaster, the low- relief, the shadows they make seem to COME TOGETHER AS AN EYE. Black.  Not human.  The woodwork around it like some half-face. \nThe GIBBERING begins to RISE. \nOUT OF THE CORNER OF HER EYE she can see a FORM beside her in the bed. \nNell's mouth moves.  She manages to form words, but it's just a whisper. \nNELL Theo... \nNell reaches out under the covers. \nHer HAND is suddenly grasped. \nTHE EYE on the wall stares.  The babbling, liquid, deep voice mounts, and as the shadows move ever so slowly, the EYE seems to roam over the room. \nNELL (cont'd) Oh, God.  It's looking for me. \nAnd then the babbling stops.  Nell grimaces in pain.  She tries to look at Theo, but it's far too DARK right there beside her. \nNELL (cont'd) Theo, my hand.  You're hurting me. \nIn the place of the babbling, another sound.  High-pitched, drawn- out.  A CHILD'S CRY.  Nell reacts. \nThe cry wails louder, coming through the wall.  It's a wail of agony.  A wail not of this earth.  Nell struggles, racked between the pain in her hand and the tortured child's cry. \nNELL (cont'd) A child.  No.  No!  I'm right HERE! \nThe EYE focusses on her.  Dead on her.  Nell stops.  And with sudden violence, she's WRENCHED out of the bed by whatever's beside her. Nell hits the floor with a scream.  She grabs at the table on this side of the bed, pulling a lamp down on her, yanking at its chain. \nThe room FLASHES into brilliance.  Nell stands up, panting... There is nothing in the room.  No Theo.  She looks at her hand. \nThe eye on the wall is gone. \nNELL (cont'd) Oh, God.  Who was holding my hand? \nNell snaps around.  There on the window, SPREADING before her eyes the frost on the glass is melting into a HORRIFYING FACE.  The face of CRAIN. \nNell recoils in prickling fear.  Living fear.  Then her fear turns to RAGE.  In the blink of an eye there's a heavy ashtray in her hand, and it's flying at the window. \nNELL (cont'd) I will not let you hurt a CHILD! \nThe window BASHES out into the night, the face vanishing with a HOWL of air. \nINT. NELL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT \nNeIl explodes from her room, a flying fury of hate.  The child-cry seems to race ahead of her into -- \nINT. THEO'S ROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) \n-- Theo's room, which is empty.  Now it seems like it's coming from the door to the hall, is right there.  Nell races after it and -- \nNell drags herself to the hand rail.  Marrow, Luke and Theo rush into view below. \nThey all react to the sight of Nell at the precarious top -- with her insanely happy smile.  They think she's there to kill herself. Just like Rene Crain. \nThey all freak out in a chorus of 'Nell!  No, Nell!' \nMARROW Nell!  Don't move. \nNell couldn't anyway.  She just grins madly, tears running down her face.  Marrow grabs for the stairs, but they shift under Nell's movement from up above. \nLUKE It's not going to hold your weight. \nMARROW Just stay there, Nell! \nMarrow mounts the stairs.  The metal support rods sing out under his weight.  And the whole thing pitches, rolling around as he goes up. Five feet.  Ten feet.  Fifteen feet up.  The sway gets wilder as he goes. \nAt twenty feet, with twenty more to go to reach Nell, he stops.  The stairs buck, sway out dizzily.  And then to his dismay, he realizes he's on the WRONG SIDE of the double helix staircase. \nMARROW (cont'd) Damn it. \nHe straddles the rail to climb over to the other half. \nLUKE Don't! \nThe sudden shift is too much for the old stairs.  The support rods CREASE and then the whole enormous column of steel from where Marrow is standing to the ground BURSTS from its supports. \nLuke shoves Theo aside, and the bottom half of the stairs spirals out in a massive, deafening COLLAPSE.  Marrow's cellular phone falls out of his pocket and shatters in hundred pieces across the floor. \nThe top half of the stairs remains, still hanging from the ceiling. Nell grips the railing at the top. \nMarrow hangs there by one hand over the razor tangle of steel below. He flails out for the other stairway, swings himself over to it.  It takes a moment for him to realize he almost just died.  A moment of paralysis.  This is no longer an experiment.  No longer fun and games. \nMARROW Nell?  Are you up there? \nThere she is.  Marrow forces himself to start climbing the shaky stairs.  Luke and Theo watch from below, tense. \nThen he's there.  Nell stands a mere arm's length from him on the other side of the railing. \nMARROW (cont'd) Come on, Nell.  You have to climb over and step back on the stairs. \nNell barely seems to hear him.  Instead she looks at the DEFORMING SUPPORT RODS around her.  We HEAR the voices of the CHILDREN, calling to her. \nMARROW (cont'd) Nell!  Now! \nTheo, on the ground, calls up to Nell. \nTHEO Nell, go with him!  Just go with him. \nNell refocuses on him and then gingerly climbs over the railing. She hangs there.  She looks down at the tangled steel below... \nNELL The children want me.  They're calling me.  They need me. \nMARROW Nell.  You will come here now. \nNell looks UP at him, hazy. \nAnd THEN BEHIND MARROW: the shifting clouds, the moon, the vines... and suddenly all these random elements behind him form a dark hideous face and in front of it a hand, and the hand is rushing forward to PUSH MARROW OFF THE STEPS. \nAfter we scream, NELL SCREAMS. \nNELL NO! \nAnd as Marrow falls forward, pushed by the force behind him, Nell grabs him... he is caught on the rail... As she has reached out to him, now she has fallen into thin air, and she falls towards Marrow, and they hold each other.  She has a hand... then a foot... she slips... she holds on again... and reaches the staircase.  She grabs on. \nA moment's peace... and then a new disaster: with a metallic POP POP POP the support rods spring from their anchors and the rest of the stairwell next to them drops to the ground in a catastrophic shattering of sound. \nMarrow looks behind him, to whatever it was that Nell saw over his shoulder.  He looks back at her.  Her eyes are closed, she won't open them. \nMARROW We're going down the stairs, Nell, I'm taking you down the stairs. \nHe leads her go down the stairs. \nINT. THEO'S ROOM - NIGHT \nMarrow and Theo stand in the doorway to the shared bathroom watching Luke finish taping a trash bag over Nell's broken window.  Nell lies in her bed, asleep or unconscious, it's impossible to say.  Luke finishes, comes over.  Marrow is hushed, grim, exhausted. \nTHEO She needs help. \nMARROW I'll take her with me to the University tomorrow.  I can't believe I read the test wrong.  I didn't see anything that looked like she was suicidal. \nLUKE You used the wrong test. \nTHEO (indignant) Will the two of you shut up!  God damn it!  Maybe the tests were right, Marrow.  She's sensitive, she's vulnerable, but I don't think she's suicidal and I didn't have to test her.  Maybe she wasn't trying to kill herself. Maybe she was really scared. Maybe she really heard voices. \nMarrow looks away, doesn't want to say this.  Theo reads the feelings on his face. \nLUKE You're not telling us something. \nMARROW Watts.  Those were his keys Nell found.  His roommate called and said Watts left when he was supposed to.  I think he's here. \nINT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT \nMarrow, Luke and Theo enter the greenhouse, the heavy growth forbidding in the darkness.  They spread out on the parallel walkways. \nTHEO Nell? \nThey reach the transept, turn down it toward the statue of Crain at the end looming white in the dusk. \nDead silence.  Then Marrow SCREAMS. \nUnder a thin layer of ice underneath the giant hand that protrudes from the pond we find Watt's body, as if the hand wants to keep him there forever.  Marrow did find his Watts, a horrifying sight. \nMARROW Oh my God it's Watts. \nAs at the same time out of the mouth from the sculpture erupts a river of blood, scaring the hell out of them.  Their clothes splattered with blood, Marrow quickly leads them out of there. \nINT. LOCKED ROOM - NURSERY - NIGHT \nNell stands there in the darkness, sensing the expanse of the room, turning... and kicking something on the floor. \nIt is a wooden toy train.  Then she sees a rocking horse by her feet.  It is a NURSERY.  Turn-of-the-century. \nAnd as Nell's eyes adjust, as she tries to see what else is in here in the dark, she begins to make out WHITE SHROUDED SHAPES. \nAgainst the wall.  A bed covered in a sheet.  A table beside it.  A HAND BELL.  A CANE. \nJust like Nell's sick room at home.  Nell realizes it, covers her mouth. \nThe furniture is in EXACTLY the same position, though the sheets covering the pieces are stained, FAR OLDER. \nAnd on the wall, something in a frame is covered with a piece of sheet. \nNell approaches it in trepidation and removes the cloth.  For a long beat, all we see is her face as it goes slack.  Understanding. \nThe framed thing is a stitchery.  It says: A PLACE FOR EVERYTHING, EVERYTHING IN ITS PLACE. \nJust like the one at home. \nINT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT \nMarrow, Theo and Luke barge into the Great Hall. \nTHEO Nell! \nLUKE We can't stay here looking for her.  She doesn't want to be found... \nMarrow and Theo look at him.  It's what they've been thinking, but haven't had the courage to say.  Theo stops suddenly.  Turns around. The men notice, and pause. \nThen they hear it.  Faint.  Floating down from upstairs somewhere. Nell's TUNE.  It doesn't sound right, but it's hard to tell as it's coming from so far away. \nThey look at each other, start for the stairs. \nINT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE LOCKED ROOM - NIGHT \nTheo, Marrow and Luke stand at the end of the dark hallway.  They stare at the gaping doors to the nursery at the far end.  The tune is coming from within.  Abruptly, it stops. \nAnd instead of Nell's tune, there's a repetitive CREAK.  CREAK. CREAK. \nIn rising dread, Theo starts forward. \nIt takes Marrow and Luke a moment to come after her.  The CREAKING gets louder, unnerving. \nThey get to the doors, Theo first.  She pushes them wide. \nINT. LOCKED ROOM - NURSERY - NIGHT \nThey stop there, staring into the shadows. \nTHEO Nell? \nAnd there, hunched over something turning a CREAKING CRANK of some sort, is Nell. \nMARROW Nell. \nNell straightens from whatever it is she was doing and turns to them.  Theo steps toward her, afraid for her. \nTHEO What'd you come back for, babe? \nNELL Just had to be sure. \nLUKE Come on, Jesus!  Let's go! \nMarrow shuts him up with a vicious gesture, stays back himself as Theo approaches Nell. \nTHEO Let's go, hon.  Don't you want to go back to your little apartment where you can hear the buoy out in the harbor when the wind is just right? \nNell smiles at Theo.  She's holding something. \nNELL Oh, Theo.  You know I don't have an apartment. \nThe WINDOW SHATTERS, dozens of panes blown out into the darkness beyond.  But the metal LATTICE remains, the chair's legs stuck in it. \nMarrow and Luke pause, taken back a beat.  They hustle over to it. Theo and Nell stand a few feet back. \nLuke grabs the chair, levers it, tries to pry open the metal. Marrow reaches through, knocking loose glass, trying to find some sort of handle on the other side. \nTHEO Hurry! \nTheo watches the door behind them.  Luke pries at the inch of metal between him and freedom.  It won't break. \nMARROW They don't open! \nMarrow slips on the broken glass and catches hold of the lattice LACERATING his ring and little finger.  With a cry of pain, he lands on the floor. \nMARROW (cont'd) Oh Jesus my hand. \nNell and Theo fall to the floor to help him.  Marrow moans, and Nell grips his injured hand in hers.  Fast, like she was born a trauma doctor, Nell clamps off the blood with her fingers. \nNELL Give me your shoelace. \nMarrow tugs at his shoe, in shock, and looks at Nell.  She's calm. Terrifyingly calm.  And in that moment, he realizes she's not out of her mind.  She just understands things beyond what he could possible begin to understand. \nMARROW What'll happen to us, Nell? \nNELL Nothing, if you leave right now. There's a war going on all around us.  Don't get in the way, please. \nNell cinches the shoelace tight around his wrist. \nLuke throws down the chair, giving up on the window. \nLUKE Shit!  All right, you sonofabitch... \nAs he looks up at another one of Crain's painting hanging on the wall.  Nell Theo with Marrow straggle toward the great hall. \nINT. VESTIBULE TOWARDS GREAT HALL - NIGHT \nLUKE Maybe this'll get your attention! \nLuke flicks a LIGHTER out of his pocket. \nMARROW Luke! \nBefore anyone can stop him, he LIGHTS a towering TAPESTRY on fire. \nHe races from one to the next, lighting them.  Theo and Nell help Marrow up, back away as Luke shoots by. \nAll the tapestries are ON FIRE, blazing up like torches. \nAt last, his rage spent, heaving, he moves to join the others at the center of the room.  They stare at him, appalled, afraid.  Knowing he has done something wrong. \nLuke stops.  Maybe fifteen feet away.  He sees their expressions. \nLUKE What? \nNell looks over at the burning tapestries.  Heat sears the stone, blackens the carved figures in the woodwork. \nThe ruddy light casts deep shadows throughout the room. \nLUKE (cont'd) We'll get out after this wing burns down.  Let's go. \nBut there's no need.  The tapestries are consuming themselves too fast to ignite the walls or ceiling.  They all realize it.  As the last flaming scraps of cloth fall to the floor and go out, there is utter silence. \nINT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT \nLuke looks at them helplessly.  An awful, impending beat.  Without warning, the huge PERSIAN CARPET he's standing on JERKS out from under him.  Luke falls on his stomach. \nStunned, Luke looks straight into Nell's eyes.  Then the carpet slides fast for the FIREPLACE.  It whips up to the hearth and sends Luke flying through the chain curtains. \nThe others are speechless.  They can do nothing but watch as Luke lays there on the ashdrop.  A long moment. \nNELL (to the house, to Crain) No!  No!  Let them go! \nShe knows what is going to happen, is powerless to prevent it.  Luke stands up, has time to give her a look. \nAnd then the LION'S HEAD FLUE drops open behind him.  Luke looks back into its iron eyes -- \n-- and with SHOCKING SPEED the FLUE snaps shut again, taking Luke's head off his body. \nThe decapitated corpse falls back in the fireplace like a puppet with its strings cut. \nNell, Marrow and Theo stand there.  Not sure of what just happened, their minds unable to accept it. \nA sound comes up in Theo's throat.  A sob.  A horrified whimper. Marrow and Nell stand there speechless.  It's as if saying the obvious will make it real: \nMARROW Luke. \nBANG.  The blood-splattered LION'S HEAD drops open.  Luke's head falls out. \nTheo SCREAMS and SCREAMS again.  Nell backs away with Marrow, almost has the presence of mind to drag them away, but -- \nThe terrified animal heads on the balustrade, their eyes flash in fear.  The lions above the big fireplace snarl restlessly. \nCherubim, afraid, clasp hands.  Gods and men pay unwilling witness to what is now coming down the stairs. \nThe upper flight of stairs strains under the weight of the thing coming down, over our heads, coming down, down... and now at the landing.  The sound stops. \nNell's BREATH escapes, visible in the cold as she watches, rooted to the floor in the Grand Entry. \nDarkness against darkness.  Something BLOCKS the glint of the gilded frame up on the landing.  Something huge.  A beat. \nAnd then a SHADOW sweeps across the scene, impenetrable, darkening the stairs, wiping them from sight, like something gliding down them. \nBefore our eyes, out of the most subtle variation of shadow, flickers into existence: \nTHE SHAPE, tall, eight or nine feet, featureless, black, but in the proportions of an enormous man with his head bowed, shoulders stooped.  And just like that, all it is... \n...is a well of darkness and night once again.  We don't even know for sure what we just saw.  But it is still there in that bar of shadow. \nNell goes rigid, not breathing, not seeing anything but the awful presence.  She is spellbound. \nBANG.  A door in the connecting passage opens, and Theo and Marrow come out, between Nell in the entry and the thing in the Great Hall beyond. \nIn a flash the SHAPE is moving at Theo and Marrow.  They don't see it, have their backs turned. \nTHEO Nell!  There you -- \nBut Nell is looking past them.  They see her face and turn around. \nNELL Nooo, not them! \nWhat is coming at them makes the blood stop. \nThe Shape rushes from the Great Hall, vanishing as it crosses the pools of moonlight, reforming darker as it hits shadow again, its wake like a shockwave, invisible itself, but VISIBLE IN ITS EFFECTS: \nTheo SCREAMS.  Marrow stumbles back.  And then Nell's voice rings out: \nNELL (cont'd) Is this where she bashed your brains in? \nThe onrushing presence STOPS.  Seems to turn its attention to Nell, standing there before the towering front doors. \nNELL (cont'd) When you came in the door?  I bet that was the last thing you expected.  Right?  From Carolyn? (beat) You thought, oh, Carolyn, I've taken it all out of her, you thought, Oh, Carolyn, she's no threat.  Carolyn.  Great Grandma Carolyn.  Did you know that? \nNell shows no fear.  There's a ferocious edge to her voice. \nNELL (cont'd) She found out what you did, and she knew there was only one way to stop you.  And she stopped you, so you couldn't torture anymore of the living. (beat) But you wouldn't even let go of the dead, would you?  Well, now I'm here.  They called me.  Did you know that?  They've been crying out for help for a long time.  And I heard them. \nShe points out at the human remains strewn all over the Great Hall. \nNELL (cont'd) And I won't let you hurt them anymore. \nThe SHAPE hovers there, silent.  Air and shadow distort around it. The carved animal heads on the Newell posts and walls loll back and forth, alive then not-alive.  Pieces of furniture stamp in fury, try to animate themselves, but can't find limbs that work. \nNELL (cont'd) Come on, Hugh Crain, you know what to do.  We've both been here before. \nThe SHAPE HOWLS FORWARD, knocking everyone out of their seats.  It flies across the floor at Nell. \nMarrow and Theo are slammed against the walls out of its way. \nNell OPENS WIDE HER ARMS in an EMBRACE. \nIt's ON HER, but just as it seems to hit, it SPLITS like she went right through it.  The SHAPE and all the debris in its wake IMPACTS deep in the enormous doors. \nThe carved WOODWORK seems to suck it all in, cracking, groaning. And then all the SCREAMS are cut off. \nNell stands there with her arms spread.  A long moment. \nShe opens her eyes. \nAnd then the woodwork LASHES OUT, grabs her from behind, slams her back against the doors.  THE BLOW HAS KILLED HER. \nWe feel her bones break as she crumples, is drawn into the woodwork. \nAnd for a few seconds Nell's body just hangs there... and then it gently falls down. \nTheo lets out a horrified cry as she runs toward Nell. \nTHEO NELL! \nMarrow gets up off the floor in terror and awe, his life his beliefs changed forever.  He walks over to Nell and feels her pulse, knowing it is a useless gesture as Theo softly moans over Nell. \nAnd as the camera pans up across the entry door, we see a new carving in the sculpted doors.  It is a woman and as we move in we can see that she wears the same necklace as Nell... \nINT. HILL HOUSE FRONT DOORS, ENTRY - EARLY MORNING \nThe HOUSE INHALES.  And BOOM! \nThe front doors blast wide.  Every door in the entry slams open. \nEXT. HILL HOUSE - EARLY MORNING \n", "test1_input": "INT. MEZZANINE - DUSK \nAs they come out of Crain's study Theo stops at the top of the stairs, Nell behind her. \nTHEO Jeez. \nNELL I know. \nThey stare out at Hugh Crain, the cracking and shadowing of the swirls of oil that compose his face.  The figure is daunting, but dead.  Just a painting.  Four different hallways lead into the mezzanine, all dark and endless in the stray light. \nNELL (cont'd) Maybe we should wait for them here. \nTheo walks out, swings around. \nTHEO Which one?  Pick any. \nNell looks from one to another.  She doesn't want to.  But she forces a smile and points to one on the left.  They both disappear into the dark gothic hallway. \nINT. SMALL PARLOR (CONFUSING ROOMS) - DUSK \nTheo breezes into a small parlor with heavy green velvet curtains, panelled walls, rich settees.  Other doors lead off the room.  Nell follows. \nTHEO This is a serious question, but do you think the Dudleys ever make love in this room?  They're alone in the house, no one watching.  No one... no one watching.  You can do what you want. \nTheo goes running for another door and is out. \nNell, realizing she's being left behind, springs after her into another mysterious hallway -- \nINT. STATUARY HALL - DUSK (CONTINUOUS) \n-- into a wide hall lined with niches and classical statuary.  Theo strides down it pointing left and right, bending over, straddling the pieces, provocative: \nTHEO Here.  Here.  Here. (under a leering gargoyle) Oh yes!  Oh yes oh YES!  Here! \nNell laughs -- appalled and loving every minute of it. \nTHEO (cont'd) Can't you just see it? \nNELL Theo! \nINT. HALL OF MIRRORS - DUSK (CONTINUOUS) \nThrough a narrow passageway, and large double doors they suddenly stand at the threshold of a fantastic ballroom lined with mirrors and chandeliers.  Rows of mirror-coated octagonal pillars, rise to a vaulted, mirrored ceiling far above.  With the door opening, there's a CLICK, and a mechanism of some sort is activated.  The FLOOR begins to MOVE like a slow turntable. \nTheo comes right up, looks over Nell's shoulder.  Nell steps out. \nShe traipses out across the room, her million reflections waltzing with her into infinity.  Theo dances after her.  They dance, not quite together.  Nell stops and pronounces: \nNELL I love this house.  I really love this house. \nTHEO (gently, recognizes that Nell is different) You're okay. \nNell blushes... and they burst out laughing.  They take off running, their reflections with them, stampeding for an archway on the far side of the room and out -- \nINT. 1ST FLOOR HALLS (VARIOUS) - DUSK (CONTINUOUS) \n-- into yet another hallway.  They race down the hall, turn into another hall, then another, all dimly lit by the very last rays of day, all furnished in the House's dark, impossibly complicated, impossibly ornate fashion.  As they go, the mood is growing darker, the women unaware that they are getting lost. \nTHEO (having fun) Rats!  We're rats in a maze! That's what this experiment is going to be! \nThey open a door to -- \nINT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE LOCKED ROOM - DUSK (CONTINUOUS) \nThey stand at the end of a long hallway to one of the House's forgotten outlying wings.  It is dark.  Too dark.  Nell and Theo regard the darkness. \nAt the far end of the hall stand a pair of MAHOGANY DOORS, closed, almost black, oily-looking.  Surrounding them, an enormously complex geometrical frieze. \nThe doors themselves are plain.  In their simplicity there is something about them enormously disturbing.  It is as if the doors are looking back at them, Nell goes cold.  Theo holds herself. \nNELL We should go back. \nTheo nods.  They turn around, Theo opening what she thinks was the door they came through. \nINT. NARROW STAIRCASE - DUSK \nThey hurry down a narrow staircase, Theo first, Nell right behind. \nNELL Theo, I'm scared -- \nThey fly down a set of steps, Theo flings open a final door -- and SCREAMS! \nINT. GRAND ENTRY - NIGHT \nThe Grand Entry, where they bump into LUKE SANDERSON, 20's, charming and cynical. \nLUKE Hi, Luke Sanderson, bad sleeper, I'm your basic tosser-turner, and you are... \nNELL Uh... Nell Vance... \n", "test1_true": "NELL Well, I... uh... \nLUKE Obsessive worrier.  Join the club. (to Theo) And you?  I'd guess... \nTHEO You'll never guess. \nShe won't answer. \nMarrow comes in the front door.  He looks at the house like MacArthur studying a beachhead. \nMARROW There we are.  You're Eleanor, you're Luke, you're Theo. \nALL Hi... hello... Dr. Marrow... \nMARROW And this is Todd, he just came up. \nTODD comes in. \nTODD Hi.  I'm Todd Aubochon. \nLUKE (1950's alien spaceman) Greetings fellow insomniac. \nTODD (playing) Greetings fellow sheep counter. \nMARROW And this is my assistant, Mary Lambretta. \nLUKE Greetings. \nAnd Mary enters.  Crossing the threshold, she catches her breath, and when she comes into the hall and sees everyone, she also sees the house in its detail.  And she has a bad feeling. \nMarrow is still putting everyone at ease. \nMARROW Eleanor, how was the drive? \nNELL You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow. \nMARROW Nell.  Good enough.  And I'm Jim. \nNELL I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim. \nMARROW Well... we're glad to have you. \nHis smile is devastating.  Nell reddens, instantly taken by Marrow's warmth, observant sensitivity.  Theo notices. \nMARROW Have either of you seen David Watts? \nTHEO No, but Nell's been here longer than I have. \nNELL I only saw Theo drive up. \nLUKE Who's Watts? \nMARROW The man who completes the group. \nFor a long moment they stand there, silent, looking at each other -- polite smiles, but awkward, even Marrow.  One by one they all look to him for a cue. \nMARROW (cont'd) Well, why don't we get some dinner while we're waiting for him? (beat, backing through the doors to the Great Hall) Welcome to Hill House, everyone. \nINT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT \nMarrow leads the way across the hall.  The others check out the furnishings as they pass. \nTODD These old Victorian houses are great, aren't they? \nLUKE (points to details; ADJUST FOR SET) It's not Victorian, everyone thinks that the whole nineteenth century was Victorian.  This is gothic, this is English Craftsman, this is Romanesque.  This is... insane.  Who lives here? \nMARROW Nobody.  A local mill owner, Hugh Crain, built it in 1830.  He had no heirs, but he put the house in trust, and the farmland around it, with the stipulation that it never be altered or sold.  Crain's executors made good investments and for the last hundred and twenty years, Hill House has taken care of itself. \nMary is shaken by the house, but she's honoring Marrow's request. Everywhere she looks, she feels the presence of something. \nTODD So what's this study all about anyway?  Mary described the kind of tests we'll be doing, but didn't fill us in on the big picture.  She said you needed bad sleepers, but this wasn't about curing the problem. \nMARY I can tell you what this is about. \nMARROW Eat first, questions later, Mary, please. \nThey exit the hall, Mary and Nell last, and as they do, Nell sees Mary's strange look.  She stops. \nNELL Is something wrong? \nMARY No.  Just... when I saw your picture I had a feeling about you, and now that I meet you, I know I was right. \nNELL What? \nMARY Eat first, questions later. \nAnd suddenly awkward, Mary exits after the others. \n", "test1_id": 2568, "test2_input": "MARROW I don't know. \nNELL It doesn't matter.  Even if they're tormenting me, someone wants me.  What I do with this is up to me.  I can be a victim, or I can be a volunteer.  And I want to be the volunteer. \nNell glances at him, and for that split second she is raw, passionate woman.  She walks away, the sway in her gait aching, powerful.  Marrow is surprised by what Nell just said and stares at her as she comes to the overgrown end.  Nell reaches out to the hanging vines, pulls them aside... \n...and A FACE stares out.  Gastly.  White.  Nell takes an involuntary step back, a little gasp. \nThe face is marble.  Blind eyes stare from stained cheeks.  It is a STATUE OF CRAIN.  Marrow comes over. \nIt's an enormous stone tableaux of Hugh surrounded by cherubim.  The plants have attacked it as if trying to wipe its funerary presence from the greenhouse. \nNELL (cont'd) Hugh Crain.  Can't seem to get away from him. \nShe laughs a little at herself.  Marrow joins in.  He helps her pull the plants back to reveal more of it. \nShe reaches out, touches the marble cheek.  Then daring, grins, and begins to hum her TUNE. \nMarrow steps back to watch her do a sensual slow-dance with Hugh Crain, pirouetting, her hips sliding past... hypnotizing Marrow. \nMARROW What is that tune? \nNELL I don't know.  A lullaby I guess. My mother used to hum it to me. And her mother before that, and so on. (to the statue) Hugh Crain, would you care to dance? \nShe hums another two notes, and BANG!  The door behind her SLAMS OPEN in a gust of wind, jolting Nell.  She stops and stares. Outside the window, through the glass, she sees Mr. Dudley, staring at her, he's been watching her dance.  The spell is broken.  Nell, embarrassed, can't bear to look at him. \nA beat, and then Marrow goes over and shuts the door.  When he turns back -- \n-- Nell is just vanishing around the corner, her rapid footsteps echoing in the vaulted room. \nEXT. REAR LAWN - DAY \nNell hurries away from the House, across the rear lawn, ashamed at herself as much as she is spooked. \nIn the distance Mr. Dudley is walking toward the House with cans of paint cleaner an a ladder.  Nell stops, watching him.  He senses her, pauses, and smiles. \nNell reacts.  Sees the ladder.  Then Mr. Dudley disappears into the House. \nNell once again starts to hurry away, but looking back over her shoulder, almost impales herself on the rusted iron fence of -- \nEXT. FAMILY CEMETERY - DAY (CONTINUOUS) \n-- the tiny Crain family cemetery.  Nell catches herself.  A small swinging gate bars the way.  She hesitates. \nNine moss-covered headstones show the wear of a long century.  Eight small headstones, one large one.  A half dozen unmarked stones in the grass: stillbirths. \nNell is drawn into the graveyard.  The large stone is RENE CRAIN'S. The smaller ones are her children's. \nNell's heart is breaking as she moves among them: the various names. One reads ADAM CRAIN APRIL 5th 1874 -- ... The rest of the date is covered by growth.  She clears it away.  April 6th, 1874. \nNELL Only two days. \nThere is an EPITAPH, almost wiped out by lichens.  Nell kneels to read it. \nNELL (cont'd) The blest are the dead / Who see not the sight / Of their own desolation... \nNell, disturbed but not knowing what to make of it, rises from the gravestone, turns to the next.  ELISA CRAIN AUGUST 21ST, 1878 -- She clears it away: August 21, 1878.  The blasphemous epitaph here: \nNELL (cont'd) A father's joy unjustly snatch'd by a jealous God... \nNell is shaken, and dreading what she will find next, whirls to the one behind her: WENDY CRAIN JANUARY 1 , 1880 -- She clears it away -- January 1, 1880.  And its graven commandment, so familiar, so comforting, now rings with terrible, malevolent promise: \nNELL (cont'd) Suffer the little children unto me. \nThere are three more grave stones, and after clearing away the brush, they too show that the babies died after a few hours, or a day.  There's the same symbol on the graves of the children, a cherub of death.  We've seen this image before.  Nell backs out of the cemetery, afraid. \nINT. MEZZANINE - DAY \nNell hurries down the mezzanine to the doorway which leads to the Red Parlor. \nINT. RED PARLOR - DAY \nShe stands there a beat staring in at the volumes upon volumes of books.  Nell is unsure of what she's looking for.  She looks at Crain's painting and recognizes the same Cherubs inside the ornate frame.  The background in the painting IS THE RED PARLOR.  Then recognizes in the painting an OPEN BOOKCASE BEHIND CRAIN. Intuitively, she turns toward the same bookcase across from her and is able to push it open.  Inside a small stairwell... \nINT. CRAIN'S SECRET STUDY - DAY \nDown the circular stairs Nell enters a very small dusty room. Velvet curtains drawn shut, only a sliver of sunlight showing through.  As her eyes adjust, she makes out the furnishings of a late-nineteenth century office, Crain's secret office. \nThe bookcases filled with business ledgers.  The business ledgers are stamped with the cherub of death. \nAt the end is an enormous desk.  Behind it a massive, carved chair covered with a sheet, only its lion-head arm rests protruding from underneath.  Nell realizes it's: \nNELL Crain's study. \nShe moves for the desk.  An ENORMOUS MIRROR, its silver inner surface flaking with age, tarnished, reflects the room, the desk, and FOR A SPLIT SECOND, A SHADOW IN THE CHAIR.  Nell steps in front of it, blocking our view. \nAnd when she steps past, there is only the dim, flaking image of the chair, the natural shadow of the room. \nNell goes around the desk, stands over it.  The chair sits silent behind her, shrouded. \n", "test2_true": "THE LEDGER is a payroll account.  Names upon names of workers rendered in sepia by Crain's severe cursive.  Notations in the column beside it indicate man, woman, or child and the appropriate wage for each class of worker.  Many of them, at least a third, are children. \nNELL reacts.  Disturbed by it.  She shifts closer to that damn chair behind her.  The sheet hangs over it in such a way that someone could be sitting there under it. \nShe turns the page.  Columns indicate pay, and so on.  But one column, at the very center of the book, hidden in the binding, is unlabeled. Down the column, some names have a line drawn through them, and at the end of the line, a CROSS. \nNell follows them back, eyes searching across the ledger. \nShe turns the page, pushes the book down revealing that concealed column, more crosses.  And more.  Her eyes flick back and forth. The crosses are paired with entries for CHILD.  She looks their names... \nNELL (cont'd) Erin, Peter and Sean and Emily and Elizabeth... who are you?  And you?  What happened to you?  You died... How did you die? \nNell turns the pages.  More and more crosses.  Dozens.  Scores. \nNell sinks down into Crain's chair and tears come to her eyes.  We see the book. \nINT. GRAND STAIRWAY - NIGHT \nThe painting is right there now.  The letters have been erased. \nINT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT \nWe see the ledger, and pull back, and the ledger is in Nell's lap. Nell sits on the bed in her sleeping tee-shirt and undies.  Theo looks at the book with her. \nTHEO That's so sad. \nNELL There's hundreds of them.  This must be a record of the children who died at the mills, like Luke said. \nTHEO Before he painted your name over Mister Crain. \nTheo hands her the bottle.  Nell takes it, tops off her glass, spilling.  Her face is red.  She grimaces as she tosses back a big swallow. \nNELL You really think it was Luke? \nTheo takes another swig.  She holds bottles of nail polish up next to Nell's bare feet, testing the colors. \nTHEO Well, it wasn't me.  Mister Dudley had to clean it and he knows that he's in charge of all the messes so why would he make more work for himself and... (beat) You said the Good Doctor was with you. \nNELL (pondering) I don't know what to think anymore. \nTHEO Just think about one thing right now: What color? \nNell finally puts the book down and takes a drink. \nNELL I've never had a pedicure before. \nTHEO Well? \nNELL Red. (into this now) What else? \nTheo smiles and takes Nell's foot gently in her hand.  She begins to paint her toenails. \nTHEO (cont'd) See, isn't this better than a hit on the head? \nNell looks down her long legs at Theo. \nNELL I'm sorry I was mad at you, Theo. \nTHEO Me too.  Although I learned one thing about you, that you don't know about yourself.  You can be a pretty decent bitch. \nNell shoots down the rest of the glass of wine. \nNELL I'll take that as a compliment. (beat, trying to sound casual) In the city, what kind of place do you live in? \nTHEO I have a loft. \nNell is thrilled with this. \nNELL A loft.  That's a lot of room for one person.  Probably.  Maybe there's room for... \nTheo looks up, understands what she's asking. \nTHEO You want to move to New York, you want to move in with me? \nNELL I don't know, you know... \nNell lies back, arms spread, lets the glass roll out of her hand. Theo paints Nell's toenails one by one, carefully guiding the brush strokes in along the skin.  Nell, unused to this, gives into the pleasure, and Theo sees how easy it is to move Nell. \nTHEO My place isn't like yours, Nell, it doesn't have a view of sea.  It doesn't have a view of anything. What's interesting about the way I live is what goes on inside the walls.  Living with me... My boundaries aren't very well defined, Nell.  Do you know what I mean? \nNELL I'm trying.  Have you ever kept something to yourself because you were afraid it'd ruin things. \nTheo looks up at her, unreadable. \nTHEO All the time. \nNell lets out a sigh.  Gently Theo's hand moves down the arch of Nell's foot.  Caressing.  Nell lets her. \n", "test2_id": 2569, "test3_input": "Luke and Theo drag Nell down the stairs into the Great Hall.  Marrow brings up the rear.  They retreat for the entry as Luke puts his jacket over Nell's shoulders.  Marrow stops, looks back up the stairs. \nMARROW Wait a second!  Wait! \nAll there is are the sounds of Nell, Luke and Theo making for the hall to the entry.  The House is silent. \nLUKE No. \nLuke goes out.  But Nell pauses, stopping Theo with her. \nThe House is quiet.  Marrow's hand still outstretched.  Nell looks around the room.  There are heads everywhere, faces: animal heads, humans, gods, all staring from the woodwork, the carpets everything. All turning to her. \nTheo looks around, but can't see what Nell is seeing.  Nell's breath comes faster, disoriented, yet aware... \nNELL They're all in here.  All the ones he killed.  They're just children! We have to help them! \nTHEO (to Marrow) Come on!  Why are we waiting? \nEven now, Marrow can't believe what he just saw, but Theo's voice brings him back.  He whirls, grabs onto Nell, helps Theo drag her out. \nEXT. HILL HOUSE DRIVEWAY/GATE - NIGHT \nFour cars sit behind the massive, locked gate, as far from Hill House as possible.  Marrow paces past the fence, staring out, the road beyond leading out of this place, so close... \nLuke digs with a pen knife at the marble footing below the gate.  No easy way under it.  He stands and gazes at the razor-sharp spikes twenty feet up.  There's no way to climb this. \nTHEO Oh my God we need to call someone? \nMarrow just looks at her and walks back to Nell's car. \nINT. NELL'S CAR - NIGHT \nNell sits in the passenger seat of her car, wrapped in her jacket. She stares out at the gate, at Luke and Theo consulting.  Marrow appears in the window. \nMARROW You okay? \nNell nods, but there's something about her not right. \nNELL Why did you bring me here? \nMarrow shakes his head, doesn't fully understand. \nNELL (cont'd) Why did you call me and tell me to look in the paper for the ad? \nMARROW Nell, what are you talking about? I never called you. \nNell stares, dismayed, but Marrow is dead serious. \nNELL But you told me to look in the paper!  You told me I'd be perfect! \nMARROW Nell, the first time I ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here. \nNELL Then who called me? \nHill House looms behind her, windows forming eyes, the carport a gaping mouth. \nNell's dismay becomes a cold, terrifying understanding, and she turns and stares back up at the House. \nLuke comes up with Theo on the other side of the car. \nTHEO Nell -- \nLUKE -- how much is this car worth? \nEXT. HILL HOUSE DRIVEWAY/GATE - NIGHT \nTheo pulls Nell away from the drive.  Marrow stands back from Nell's car where Luke belts in behind the wheel. \nLuke eases the car forward to the gate.  He advances until the car's bumper makes contact.  And then without further ado, REVS the engine. \nThe Buick grinds into the heavy steel bars.  The chain tightens around the two halves of the gate, but shows not the slightest strain. \nINT. NELL'S CAR - NIGHT \nLuke grimaces, shifts into low, pours on the gas. \nEXT. MAIN GATE - NIGHT \nThe car fishes back and forth against the gate, hurling a shower of gravel on the other cars off to the side of the road.  Marrow, Nell and Theo move back. \nOne of the Buick's headlights breaks.  The grill mashes in.  For a long moment the car struggles against the Gate.  No good.  Luke eases up. \nTheo looks at Marrow.  Luke puts the car in reverse. \nLUKE Get the hell out of the way! \nThey back way up.  Luke vanishes up the drive in the car.  And then the Buick comes around the corner, accelerating, slicing down the gravel road. \nINT. NELL'S CAR - NIGHT \n", "test3_true": "EXT. MAIN GATE - NIGHT \nThe car SMASHES into it... and is STOPPED, collapsing, twisting in a deafening hail of steel and glass. \nThe massive gate has BENT itself AROUND the car, holding it in its steel-grip. \nEXT. GATE - NIGHT \nNell understands, the house will not let her go.  She turns away from the gate, faces the House, mesmerized by the beauty in this monstrosity.  The House is calling her back, and Nell is drawn towards it.  She starts walking... \nINT. NELL'S CAR - NIGHT \nLuke gasps for the seat belt, the wind knocked out of him, steering column pushed to his chest.  Marrow and Theo run up outside.  Luke sees him, sees he's not getting any closer than ten feet, and he's looking back at the gas tank. \nLuke gets the seatbelt off, tries to open the door but it's warped shut.  He struggles to get out from behind the wheel.  Sparks jump from the battery.  Gas shoots out of the fuel pump onto the shattered window.  He knows he's in trouble. \nTHEO Hurry.  The gas!  Luke... The gas! \nFinally Luke gets free of the wheel.  It's agonizing to watch... The passenger door is jammed shut too. \nHe squirms into the back seat.  The rear doors are in the same condition as the front.  But the rear window is blown out.  He crawls out onto the trunk. \nEXT. MAIN GATE - NIGHT \nMarrow hurries around the back of the car, staying clear of the lake of gas spreading about it.  Luke rolls off.  Marrow helps him up, and gets him away a safe distance. \nLUKE I'm okay.  Okay.  Just my chest. Just my wind knocked out. \nMarrow looks up at the gate.  It is even more impassible than before with the gasoline-saturated wreck in it.  No way to try another break-out either. \nLUKE (cont'd) Sorry about your car, Nell. \nHe turns around.  The others do too. \nNo Nell.  Luke and Theo look up.  Mute dread.  No Nell anywhere. \nMARROW Oh, no. \nINT. GRAND ENTRY - NIGHT \nThe massive black door swings silently into the dark, vaulted entry. Marrow pauses there, looks about, and then enters.  He holds a tire iron. \nLuke does too.  He and Theo follow Marrow in. \nTHEO I'm sure she went back to her room. \nINT. GRAND STAIRWAY - NIGHT \nThey stay to the outside of the stairs, padding silently up, trying to get a glimpse of the floor above.  It's shrouded in darkness. \nThey turn at the landing, eyes riveted to the top of the stairs. They start up. \nINT. 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY, NORTH WING - NIGHT \nMarrow, Luke and Theo pause at the top of the stairs and peer down both long, empty directions of the hallway. \nThen Marrow turns toward Nell and Theo's room.  The brass candelabra... in front of the open door. \nThe rooms draw nearer, closer.  Not even the sound of their breathing. \nThe door is ajar.  Marrow pushes it open with the tire iron.  The room lies in silent disarray.  Normal disarray.  The bed normal. The ceiling normal.  No Nell. \nMarrow and Theo REACT and enter the room.  Luke lingers out in the hall a moment.  And just as he steps in after them we HOLD on the long, empty hall -- \n-- and a FIGURE glides across.  Far down at the other end.  She disappears.  It was Nell. \nINT. STATUARY HALL - NIGHT \nNell walks through the row of dark statues.  Carved faces watch her pass. \nINT. HALL OUTSIDE LOCKED ROOM - NIGHT \nNell stands before the threshold of the horrific doors, once locked, now inexplicably OPEN.  The mythological frieze on the door split in half, a world cut in two, a seal broken.  Like something has come out of its tomb. \nNell steps into the blackness. \nINT. THEO'S ROOM - NIGHT \nMarrow comes out of the bathroom, joining Theo by the window next to her bed.  Luke stands in the doorway. \nTHEO Was sure she'd be in here. \nLUKE (worried) Where in the hell can she be. \nMarrow remembers. \nMARROW Oh no... \n", "test3_id": 2570}

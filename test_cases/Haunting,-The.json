{"test1_input": "NELL Well, I've never lived with beauty.  You must love working here. \nMrs. Dudley peers at her.  A beat.  And then, cryptic: \nMRS. DUDLEY It's a job.  I keep banker's hours.  I set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six.  You can serve yourselves.  Breakfast is ready at nine.  I don't wait on people.  I don't stay after dinner.  Not after it begins to get dark.  I leave before dark comes.  We live in town.  Nine miles.  So there won't be anyone around if you need help.  We couldn't even hear you, in the night. \nNELL Why would we -- \nMRS. DUDLEY -- no one could.  No one lives any nearer than town.  No one will come any nearer than that.  In the night.  In the dark. \nAnd with that Mrs. Dudley grins, rictus-like.  She turns and closes the door after her. \nNell stands there a long moment, the room silent, heavy, old.  She goes to the windows, peers out.  Nothing but forest for miles.  The sun is setting. \nNell removes her windbreaker, opens her suitcase, takes out a blouse and skirt.  Decent enough clothes, but cheap, the tags still on them. \nINT. 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY, NORTH WING - DAY \nNell emerges from her room in her new clothes.  The hallway curves away into the distance, lined with massive, ornate doorframes like the one to her room. \nTrying to get a better look, Nell searches the walls for a light switch, but can't find one.  She follows the chair rail back to -- \nINT. MEZZANINE - SUNSET (CONTINUOUS) \n-- the mezzanine at the top of the stairs.  She searches in vain for a light switch there.  Finally she spots a set of curtains and slings them open. \nThe light, late-day though it is, makes her wince.  The window looks down on the driveway.  Outside a BEIGE CAR crunches over the gravel.  Somebody else has arrived. \nNell watches the car move past, trying to get a glimpse of the driver, but from up here, all she can see is roof. \nNELL Finally. \nShe backs away from the window, spins around -- \n-- and out of the darkness, powerful, mad, looms the visage of Hugh Crain.  It is the painting.  It is only from up here on the second floor with this curtain open that the FACE is visible in the late- day sunlight. \nDespite the artist's discretion, the lines in the man's skin, his eyes, his posture, cry of unspeakable sickness. \nUnconsciously, Nell takes a step back.  In the far b.g., near the end of one of the halls, a DOOR stands open, the second or third set of doors in the Gothic Hallway left of the painting.  Just as it starts to come into view, and we're starting to see it, it swings silently shut. \nBut Nell has caught the movement out of the corner of her eye. \nINT. 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY, NORTH WING - DAY \nNell stares down the long hallway.  Which door was it? \nNELL Hello? \nNo response.  She starts down the hall, slow at first, then faster. \nShe passes door after door, shadow after shadow, and as she nears the end of the hall... there is no door here.  Not within 20 feet of, where we thought we just saw it. \nA WHISPER.  VOICES.  Nell backs away.  And then LAUGHTER.  Behind her.  It's coming from another stairwell.  Very real... and very human. \nINT. BACK STAIRWAY - DAY \nNell looks down from the top of the stairs.  Below Mrs. Dudley and THEO, 20s, exotic, sophisticated, in Vera Wang leather, wrestle with a pile of designer luggage.  Theo peers up.  She's dark, sexy in an amused, worldly way: someone who has seen and done it all. \nTHEO You may think I have a sickness about packing, but asking people to help me shlep the stuff I take with me everywhere is a cheap and exploitative way of making new friends.  My name's Theo. \nTheo foists a very heavy bag off on Mrs. Dudley who looks like she's been handed a snake.  That makes Nell smile.  She comes running down to help with the bags. \nNELL I'm Eleanor but everyone calls me Nell.  Eleanor Vance.  Nell.  I'm really glad you're here.  Really. \nTheo is a little thrown by Nell's gushing. \nNELL (cont'd) What a beautiful jacket. \nTheo looks her over... and understands.  Nell is desperate to be liked. \nTHEO And what you're wearing, that's great, too. \nNELL This?  It's from a thrift shop. \nTHEO What did it cost? \nNELL Fifteen dollars. \nTHEO That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it! \nNELL (embarrassed by the simple truth) It's all I could afford. \nTHEO Wait.  You're not wearing that ironically?  This is really you? \nNELL I don't know what you mean. \nMrs. Dudley, walking ahead, looks back at them.  Then continues up. Theo makes a face at Mrs. Dudley's back.  Nell smiles, a little. \nTHEO A week.  You and I?  We're going to have fun. \n", "test1_true": "Mrs. Dudley opens the door, letting Theo and Nell into a large bedroom, a mirror-image twin of Nell's room, except it's decorated in rich red-orange velvets. \nTHEO This is so twisted. \nShe dumps her stuff on the floor, grabs a banister on the four- poster bed, swings cat-like onto its high mattress. \nMRS. DUDLEY I set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six. \nMrs. Dudley lays Theo's suitcase on a luggage stand. \nMRS. DUDLEY Breakfast is at nine.  I don't stay after dinner.  Not after it begins to get dark. \nTheo, back to Mrs.  Dudley, rolls her eyes at Nell. \nMRS. DUDLEY (cont'd) I leave, before dark.  So there won't be anyone around if you need help. \nNELL We couldn't even hear you. \nMrs. Dudley looks up at Nell who mimics her scary smile. \nMRS. DUDLEY No one could.  No one lives any nearer than town. \nNELL No one will come any nearer than that. \nMrs. Dudley smiles at Nell, but it's softer than before. \nMRS. DUDLEY In the night.  In the dark. \nTheo leans on the bed, musing at the exchange.  And then Mrs. Dudley backs out of the room, shuts the door. \nNELL (cont'd) My room is right next door.  I think we share a bathroom. \nTheo has an interesting eye on Nell, she's studying her. \nTHEO Don't worry, I probably won't be in here much.  Light sleeper. \nNELL That's why we're here. \nTHEO What do you do? \nNELL I'm between jobs right now.  My last job... it... the person I was working for... the job ended. Over.  So... And you? \nTHEO That depends. \nTheo pops a dress bag on the bed, unzips it.  Theo takes off her coat, and is only wearing a black bra underneath.  Nell reacts, turns away.  Back to the camera, Theo flicks off her bra, stretches. \nTHEO (cont'd) I'm supposed to be an artist, but I've been really distracted from work by love.  Do you know what I mean? \nNELL Not really. \nTHEO Don't tell me Boston is different from New York. \nNELL (she knows this from magazines) Ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment. \nTHEO My boyfriend thinks so, my girlfriend doesn't.  If we could all live together... but... they hate each other.  It's hard to be Miss Perversity when you're the only one at the party.  D'you know what I mean? \nNELL No. \nTHEO (delighted) A blank canvas!  I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not.  So, you?  Husbands? Boyfriends?  Girlfriends?  Where do you live? \nNELL I don't have anyone. (beat, lying) But I do have a little apartment of my own.  It has a little flower garden.  You can just see the ocean.  At night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the buoys in the harbor. \nNell peeks, sees Theo is decent, turns around. \nTHEO That sounds really nice.  You're lucky.  But you know that. \nTheo comes over, straightens Nell's seams; this is an intimate, forward gesture. \nTHEO (cont'd) (with meaning) Come on, we've seen enough of the bedroom for now. \nINT. 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY - DUSK \nThe long hall is lost in shadow, its long rows of doors waiting in the deadening silence.  A lamp on a pier table casts a small pool of light.  The walls glow in rich tones, the low-relief carvings a worm's-wood of shadow. \nNell runs her hand over a wall panel as Theo peeks into a neighboring room. \nNELL So much carving.  It's everywhere. On everything. \nTheo starts down the hall.  Nell follows. \nINT. RED PARLOR - DUSK \nNell and Theo enter a room just off the landing, a lavish parlor with the omnipresent panelled walls, lush red carpet, velvet curtains sweeping floor to ceiling, heavy pieces of furniture.  Nell watches Theo explore.  As Theo moves through the room, Nell's eye lands on another painting of Hugh Crain.  Inside it's ornate golden framework, distinctive little cherubs are embedded.  Cherubs of Death... She runs her fingers over it. \nTHEO Maybe you shouldn't touch -- \nTheo twirls out of the room, Nell, anxious, behind her. \n", "test1_id": 2568, "test2_input": "INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nA chandelier hangs unlit over a long dining table.  LAUGHTER.  At the end Nell and the others sprawl over the remains of a dinner which has been going on for hours.  Luke is opening another bottle of jug wine. \nLUKE You know what I love about wine that comes in bottles like this? \nTODD What? \nLUKE Every year is a good year. \nMARROW Theo?  It's your turn. \nTheo twirls her wine glass, licks the dregs inside the rim, thinking. \nTHEO The rest of you may hate your insomnia, but I find it the best time of the day for me.  I'm alone.  Nobody's talking to me but myself.  My mind is racing with ideas, and I can think. \nLUKE Nah, you're going crazy with doubt, all of your mistakes are coming back up the pipes, and it's worse than a nightmare. -- \nNell isn't used to people being so direct and at the same time, playful.  She glances at Marrow's LEFT HAND: NO WEDDING RING. \nTHEO (cont'd) Excuse me. \nLUKE Don't give me that look, it's everybody's problem, we just have different variations, I for example.  I fall asleep easily. But I wake up around two or three in the morning, every morning. It's that time of night that Fitzgerald called the deep dark night of the soul.  I stare into... the abyss.  Every night. (breaks his own somber mood) It's the price I pay for being such a jolly fellow. (to Mary) Y usted? \nMARY I think I'd fall asleep easily, but just as I start to feel comfortable, I see things in the dark. \nNell hears this, Nell is tuned into Mary. \nMARY I feel the presence of something watching me.  It's not... scary... not by itself but... I don't want to go to sleep because I'm worried about the thing attacking me.  So when I finally do fall asleep, I'm like a soldier who's fallen asleep at her post.  I feel like I've betrayed myself.  Nell? \nNell wishes she could hide under her plate. \nNELL All of you have such interesting problems. \nThere's laughter. \nNELL (cont'd) No... Please, I know how that sounds but... You're all so articulate.  You know how to talk. I feel like I'm here under false pretenses.  It's silly, it's not like... well, all of you have trouble sleeping because you live in the world, and the world is complicated and scary, but nothing's ever happened to me.  So I don't have a reason to sleep badly. \nMARROW You wrote that you had trouble sleeping. \nNELL Yes, because someone was always keeping me awake.  Ever since I was little.  That was my job.  I took care of my mother and I had to be there for her all night long, and she woke up all the time.  And after she died, well, it's been a few months, but I still, I still wake up, it's... a habit. (beat) I know we've only known each other a couple of hours, but I'm really glad to be with people who let me talk about this.  I'm really happy to be here with you. \nSilence.  The others are embarrassed by her sincerity.  She's right, Nell is not of their world. \nMARROW We're glad you're here. \nHe says this with enough sympathy for Theo to see his interest in the girl in the thrift shop dress. \nMARROW (cont'd) Why don't we move to another room? \nINT. RED PARLOR - NIGHT \nThe HARP sings out, lively, expertly played by Mary.  Theo, Luke, Todd and Nell are impressed with her skill. \nMARY It's an Erard.  Late 1870s. \nShe plays, and as she does, she's aware of the room, and the house, and she sees something in a curtain or the fireplace, or a window, something at the edge of perception.  She suddenly stops. \nNELL What's wrong? \nMARY The harp is out of tune. \nShe finds a key and begins TIGHTENING the strings -- as Marrow bangs open the door, briefcase in one hand, CELL PHONE in the other.  He can't conceal his irritation.  Marrow removes folders from his briefcase, passes them around while she plays.  Nell again studies the Cherub of Death on the spine of the leather bound books. \nMARROW I'll have to count David Watts as a no-show.  So let's start.  Thank you, Mary. \nThat was a little abrupt, she feels it.  Everybody finds a chair or spot on the sofa.  Mary remains on the stool by the harp.  Marrow sits in a large winged-back chair. \nMARROW (cont'd) All right?  So, to answer your earlier question, Todd, why are we here?  What do we all need in life, what are the basics?  We need food, we need water, we need sleep.  Sleep.  All of you resist it?  Why?  What does that mean? Why do we resist sleep?  My field of study is the individual's psychology of emotion and performance. \nLUKE So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test? \nMARROW I thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't so pleasant you'd all sleep too easily.  You'll be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you've got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company. \nTHEO When do we take the tests? \nMARROW Every day.  Basically we'll be hanging out together like we have so far this evening. \nNell and Theo are looking through their folders: sheets of paper, bizarre geometric puzzles. \nMARROW Also, there is no phone service to the House and no TV.  I have the cell phone for emergencies.  We'll begin the tests after breakfast tomorrow. \nThe others shuffle through papers, Nell and Todd intent on them, Theo interested but not overly so, Luke, bored. \nMARY Dr. Marrow, what is this house? \nWhen she says this, we should be seeing her from an odd perspective, the house's POV. \nMARROW (cont'd) There was once a king who built a palace.  The King's name was Hugh Crain.  A hundred and thirty years ago, when the Merrimack Valley was the center of American industry, Hugh Crain made two hundred million dollars.  That's forty- three billion dollars in today's money.  He could have anything he wanted.  And what he wanted, was Rene, his banker's beautiful daughter.  Rene, and a house filled with children. \n", "test2_true": "MARROW But there's a sad catch to the story. \nMARY What happened? \nMARROW There were no children.  Rene died, and then Hugh Crain built all of this, and then he died. His heart was broken. \nNell shifts, looks at the house with a strange feeling. \nNELL That's so sad. \nThis has been tense between them, a gunfight.  POP!  A LOG in the fireplace makes everyone jump.  Theo relishes it, but Nell shudders. \nMARY I think there's more to the story. This house has its own music, Doctor Marrow, I can play it for you, I can hear it. \nMary plays, channeling unholy music from the house, from the walls, from the curtain, from the air.  Her fingers fly down the harp to the THICKEST WIRE and -- \n-- TANG!  Like a steel whip the wire SNAPS. \nMary SCREAMS in pain. \nMARY My eye... oh... my eye... my eye... oh... No... \nThe others leap up in shock.  Blood lines the wall behind her.  She clutches at her eye, more blood spilling out from between her fingers. \nTODD Oh Jesus. \nMarrow and Theo rush over to her as she shrieks in pain. \nTodd is frozen, pale, like he's about to be sick.  Nell turns the OTHER WAY, but not because she's scared -- she's searching for a shot glass on a side table. \nMarrow wraps Mary in his arms.  Her shrieking becomes a terrified but quieter wail. \nMARROW Mary, let me see your eye. \nNell appears by his side with the glass.  Marrow pries Mary's hand from her face. \nBlood flows freely from the eyelid, but her eye is intact. \nNELL Here, cover it.  Don't let her touch it. \nEXT. HILL HOUSE DRIVEWAY - NIGHT \nMarrow slams the door on the passenger side of Todd's car.  Mary sits there, moaning, glass covering her eye, blood spilling out around the edges.  Luke is on her side of the car. \nLUKE Keep your head back, that's it. \nTodd opens his door.  Marrow hands him a key. \nMARROW Here's my key to the gate.  Call me the second you know anything. \nTodd takes it, jumps in.  The two men watch the car drive away. \nLUKE That could have been worse. \nMARROW Yeah. \nAs they turn back, Marrow taps Luke. \nMARROW Luke, can I talk to you? \nLUKE Sure. \nMARROW Because... well, I know I can trust you. \nLUKE Why? \nMARROW I've read your tests. \nThat was half a joke, and both men smile.  Now they're bonded. \nMARROW (cont'd) There's something... I... I didn't tell you everyth1ng about the house, and about Hugh Crain... but I'm asking you not to repeat it. \nLUKE I can keep a secret. \nThey go in.  The house is outlined by the sky and clouds and the moon. \nINT. MEZZANINE - NIGHT \nLuke catches up with Nell and Theo as he reaches the mezzanine.  The painting of Hugh Crain, barely visible in the shadows, looms right behind. \nLUKE He said that Hugh Crain... Hugh Crain was a monster.  He said that he was a brutal, horrible man.  He told me that Crain drove his workers to early deaths.  Crain had children chained to the looms in his mill.  And listen to this: his beautiful Rene killed herself. \nTHEO And why didn't Marrow tell us? Doesn't he trust women?  That fuck. \nNELL (she's thinking about the story, not Marrow) A monster?  But he built this for the woman he loved, like the Taj Mahal. \nTHEO The Taj Mahal wasn't a palace, it was a tomb.  Why didn't he tell us? \n", "test2_id": 2569, "test3_input": "MARROW Hmm. \nNELL I'm sorry.  I'm messing up the study. \nMARROW No you're not.  Something moved you.  You saw something. \nNell looks to him.  He's sincere.  He believes her. \nNELL I don't know.  Maybe I... \n\"Didn't\" she almost says.  She struggles, embarrassed. \nNELL (cont'd) I haven't been with people in a long time. \nMarrow settles in his chair, looks out at the forest. \nMARROW I really haven't either. \nNell peers at him, doubtful.  Is she being made fun of? \nMARROW (cont'd) I mean, I'm surrounded by people, day in, dayout.  Students, colleagues. (beat) But most of the time, even when I'm with them... you know... It's all about power, there's not much room for actually getting to know someone or having someone getting to know you. \nNell's face flushes with compassion.  With longing.  Marrow looks at her.  He's vulnerable.  Needing.  She doesn't dare hope.  The moment lasts a few heartbeats. \nHe looks away.  A flicker of distress crosses Nell's face.  And then she realizes Marrow is looking at -- \n-- Luke. \nLUKE (cont'd) You have to see something. \nINT. GRAND STAIRWAY - DAY \nLuke, Nell and Marrow mount the stairs, climb up and up.  They find Theo in the mezzanine staring at the wall at the painting.  She turns and looks at Nell strangely. \nNell, confused, turns around.  On the wall and the painting are dark stains.  Black.  Blue.  Runny.  Almost like something leaking from the roof has run down. \nNell steps back.  The stains are the letters N and O.  Pulling back farther: the rest of the word ELEANOR. \nNELL My name. \nShe follows the streaking substance up, blinking in rising fear as more running letters appear.  The word: WELCOME.  And higher up, the last: HOME. \nNELL (cont'd) No... \nBut the substance doesn't come from the ceiling. \nIt is as if the oils on the PAINTING OF HUGH CRAIN have been boiled by a heat gun and blasted off, running down from there.  Hugh's face is gone.  In place of the face, the underlying ivory of the canvas glares out... like a skull. \nNell SCREAMS and runs away, the others calling out after her in alarm.  As they vanish around the corner, the camera tilts down and we discover smeared paint on the floor.  Smeared, it seems, WITH LITTLE FOOTPRINTS in it. \nINT. RED PARLOR - DAY \nNell, panic rising in her voice, confronts the others. \nNELL Welcome Home Eleanor.  Welcome Home?  I've never been here.  Who did this? \nLUKE It's somebody's idea of a joke. \nShe looks at all three of them. \nNELL Who did this?  Why are you doing this?  I don't know any of you. You don't know me.  Why are you doing this to me? \nLuke shakes his head.  Theo starts getting pissed.  Marrow stands there, arms folded, observing. \nLUKE I didn't do it. \nTHEO You could have. \nLUKE So could you!  Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting? \nTHEO No. \nNELL Theo... Did you? \nTHEO Maybe you did it yourself. \nNELL Why? \nTHEO I don't know.  You've been alone for a long time, maybe you want attention. (pointing to Marrow) Maybe he did it... \nMARROW I didn't.  You know that, Nell. \nThis is horrifying to Nell, being doubted and accused of something so ugly if it were true. \nNELL I don't know anything.  Whoever did this, please, just... just say so... just... please... this is cruel.  Don't be cruel to me.  I can't stand it.  You don't know me. \nAnd she runs out. \nNell grabs for the door to leave. \n", "test3_true": "EXT. 2ND FLOOR BALCONY - DAY \nNell stands at the railing of a stone balcony on the house's second floor.  The air stirs her hair.  She peers up at the House's roofline, its clusters of misplaced windows and other features like so many screaming heads. \nChilled, she pulls her sweater closer.  Marrow comes out onto the balcony from twin French doors behind her. \nNELL Are you coming to confess? \nMARROW I wish I were.  I wish I had done it, then I could confess and you'd be at peace.  That great moral philosopher Frank Sinatra once said to someone he loved, I wish you had an enemy, so I could beat him up. \nShe smiles. \nNELL Let's say it wasn't you.  Who did it? \nMARROW I don't know. \nNELL It was a stupid thing to do. \nMARROW It was. \nNELL (for the absurdity of the idea) Welcome Home. \nMARROW You'll never see it again.  Mr. Dudley's taking care of it. (beat) I'm sorry, Nell.  Can I show you something you'd like to see? \nNELL (still too shaky for enthusiasm) Sure. \nINT. GREENHOUSE - DAY \nMarrow lets Nell into a long, Victorian-era GREENHOUSE.  It's overgrown, lush, the leaded-glass panes above stained with years of condensation and pollen.  Vines and trees climb up the sides.  Beds of flowers and plants line narrow footpaths of brick. \nNell leans down to look into a WATER GARDEN with a STATUE OF A MAN bursting from the surface, grasping for the air as if he had been drowning.  A sudden rumble runs throughout the greenhouse.  And A CAVALCADE of water comes out of the STATUE'S mouth surprising Nell. She lets out a little yelp, and then laughs with Marrow. \nNell loves the greenhouse.  It takes her breath away. \nNELL Oh... it's so beautiful... \nNell makes her way among the plants.  She looks up at a TOWERING, DOUBLE-HELIX STAIRCASE which rises from the floor to a platform which gives access to the roof.  Below the staircase are planters filled with violets. \nNELL (cont'd) Violets.  Somebody must've died here. \nAnd then, out of the corners, comes Mister Dudley. \nMR. DUDLEY That's where she hanged herself. \nNELL Who? \nMR. DUDLEY Rene Crain.  Up there.  Rope. Ship's hawser.  Hard to tie. Don't know how she got it. \nMARROW That's enough, Mister Dudley. \nMR. DUDLEY She stepped off the platform. (he looks up, with a suggestive leer) They had long skirts in those days. \nMARROW Thank you, Mister Dudley, please... \nMR. DUDLEY House is full of stories.  If you know how to read these things, it's an open book.  Just a different library than the kind you're used to. \nNELL Why? \nMR. DUDLEY Why'd she kill herself? \nNELL Yes. \nMR. DUDLEY (what other reason is there?) She was unhappy. \nNELL Why? \nMR. DUDLEY Can't say.  Haven't been here that long. (he's off) Well, it's Labor Day, gotta get to work. \nAnd off he goes. \nMARROW That's a horrible story. \nNell looks up, and smiles. \nMARROW (cont'd) You're smiling. \nMarrow watches her as she moves about, takes a heavy, ripe bloom in hand, lifts it to her face.  While she talks, she walks, and Marrow follows. \nNELL I was just thinking how happy I am right now.  All my life, I've been waiting for an adventure.  And I thought, oh, I'll never have that, adventures are for people who travel long distances, that's for soldiers, that's for the women that the bullfighters fall in love with.  And here I am, and something is happening to me. Strange noises in the night. Paintings are calling to me.  And all it cost to get there was five gallons of gas.  I'm getting my adventure. \nFor the first time since we've seen Nell, there is something to her which is simply... erotic.  Marrow follows her down one of the footpaths.  She smiles back at Marrow as he trails her.  She reaches a transept in the greenhouse, and as she turns down it, there's the slightest sway to her gait.  Marrow follows her around the corner into the transept.  At the far end the wall is completely overgrown. \nNell looks up through the ceiling at Hill House looming grim outside, distorted in the old glass. \nMARROW Someone is playing with you. \nNELL Why? \n", "test3_id": 2570}

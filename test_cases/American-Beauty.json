{"train": "CONTINUED: \nBRAD, a dapper man in his thirties, approaches and observes Lester, who is unaware of his presence. \nLESTER (CONT'D) It's 555 0199. Lester Burnham. Thank you! \nLester disconnects the call, obviously irritated. \nBRAD Hey Les. You got a minute? \nLester turns around, smiling perfunctorily \nLESTER For you, Brad? I've got five. \nINT. BRAD'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER \nBrad is seated behind his desk in his big corner office. \nBRAD I'm sure you can understand our need to cut corners around here. \nLester sits across from him, looking small and isolated. \nLESTER Oh, sure. Times are tight, and you gotta free up cash. Gotta spend money to make money. Right? \nBRAD Exactly. So... \nBrad stands, ready to usher Lester out. \nLESTER (blurts) Like the time when Mr. Flournoy used the company MasterCard to pay for that hooker, and then she used the card numbers and stayed at the St. Regis for, what was it, like, three months? \nBRAD (startled) That's unsubstantiated gossip. \nLESTER That's fifty thousand dollars. That's somebody's salary. That's somebody who's gonna get fired because Craig has to pay women to fuck him! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBRAD Jesus. Calm down. Nobody's getting fired yet. That's why we're having everyone write out a job description, mapping out in detail how they contribute. That way, management can assess who's valuable and-- \nLESTER Who's expendable. \nBRAD It's just business. \nLESTER (angry) I've been writing for this magazine for fourteen years, Brad. You've been here how long, a whole month? \nBRAD (frank) I'm one of the good guys, Les. I'm trying to level with you. This is your one chance to save your job. \nLester stares at him, powerless. \nEXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON \nA MOVING VAN is parked in front of the COLONIAL HOUSE next door to the Burnhams'. Movers carry furniture toward the house. \nThe Mercedes-Benz pulls into the Burnham driveway. Carolyn drives, Lester is in the passenger seat. \nCAROLYN --there is no decision, you just write the damn thing! \nLESTER You don't think it's weird and kinda fascist? \nCAROLYN Possibly. But you don't want to be unemployed. \nLESTER Oh, well, let's just all sell our souls and work for Satan, because it's more convenient that way. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCAROLYN Could you be just a little bit more dramatic, please, huh? \nAs they get out of the car, Carolyn scopes out the MOVERS next door. \nCAROLYN (CONT'D) So we've finally got new neighbors. You know, if the Lomans had let me represent them, instead of-- (heavy disdain) --\"The Real Estate King,\" that house would never have sat on the market for six months. \nShe heads into the house, followed by Lester. \nLESTER Well, they were still mad at you for cutting down their sycamore. \nCAROLYN Their sycamore? C'mon! A substantial portion of the root structure was on our property. You know that. How can you call it their sycamore? I wouldn't have the heart to just cut down something if it wasn't partially mine, which of course it was. \nINT. BURNHAM HOUSE - DINING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT \nCONTINUED: \nJane puts her plate in the dishwasher and leaves. We FOLLOW HER out the door, then the camera JERKS back to Lester calling after her. \nCLOSE on the face of   RICKY FITTS, illuminated by the screen of his DIGICAM as he   videotapes. Ricky is eighteen, but his eyes are much older.   Beneath his Zen-like tranquility lurks something wounded...   and dangerous. \nHis POV, on VIDEO: Through the kitchen window, we see Lester at the sink, rinsing off his plate, muttering to himself. His head suddenly jerks up and he looks at us, as if he realizes he's being watched. \nINT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nLester's POV: We're looking out through the kitchen window at the point where Ricky was just standing, but he's no longer there. \nLester turns off the faucet, dries his hands, then tosses the towel on the counter on his way out, where it lands next to a framed PHOTOGRAPH of Lester, Carolyn, and a much-younger Jane, taken several years earlier at an amusement park. \nIt's startling how happy they look. \nEXT. SALE HOUSE - DAY \nCLOSE on a wooden SIGN that reads: \nOPEN HOUSE TODAY \nBURNHAM & ASSOCIATES REALTY \n555-0195 Carolyn Burnham \nThe sign is planted in front of a RUN-DOWN HOME in a   run-down neighborhood. The Mercedes is parked in front of the   house. Carolyn, wearing a smart business suit, is unloading   a box of cleaning supplies and a BOOMBOX from the back of the   Mercedes when something across the street catches her eye. \nHer POV: In front of a different house with much more curb appeal is another SIGN, featuring a picture of a handsome silver-haired MAN. It reads: \nAnother One SOLD By Buddy Kane \nThe Real Estate King 555-0100 \nCarolyn frowns and slams the back of the Mercedes shut. \nINT. SALE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nThe interior of this house is ugly, oppressive and tasteless. Carolyn opens the front door, breathes deeply and solemnly announces: \nCAROLYN I will sell this house today. \nShe neatly arranges her sales materials on a desk, then strips down to her undergarments. \nMONTAGE: \nWe see Carolyn, working with fierce concentration as she: \nCleans glass doors that overlook the patio and pool; \nDoggedly scrubs countertops in the kitchen; \nPerches on a stepladder to dust a cheap-looking ceiling fan in the master bedroom; \nAnd vacuums a dirty carpet that will never be clean. \nThroughout all this, she keeps repeating to herself: \nCAROLYN (CONT'D) I will sell this house today. I will sell this house today. I will sell this house today. \nINT. SALE HOUSE - BATHROOM - LATER \nCarolyn stands in front of the mirror, wearing her suit once more, applying lipstick. She stares at her reflection critically. \nCAROLYN I will sell this house today. \nShe says this as if it were a threat, then notices a smudge on the mirror and wipes it off. \nEXT. SALE HOUSE - FRONT YARD - LATER \nThe front door opens to reveal Carolyn, greeting us with the smile she thinks could sell ice to an Eskimo. \nCAROLYN Welcome. I'm Carolyn Burnham! \nINT. SALE HOUSE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS \nSmiling, Carolyn leads a man and woman into the living room. They're thirtyish, and they've seen a lot of houses today. \nCAROLYN This living room is very dramatic. Wait 'til you see the native stone fireplace! \nThe man and woman glance around the dark room, unimpressed. \nLESTER Well, I bet money she's going to resent it. And I'm missing the James Bond marathon on TNT. \nCAROLYN Lester, this is important. I'm sensing a real distance growing between you and Jane. \nLESTER Growing? She hates me. \nCAROLYN She's just willful. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLESTER She hates you too. \nCarolyn stares at him, unsure of how to respond. \nINT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - LATER \nThe uniformed girls now stand in formation on the gym floor. \nANNOUNCER (over P.A.) And now, for your half-time entertainment, Rockwell High's award- winning Dancing Spartanettes! \nIn the crowded stands, Lester and Carolyn find seats. \nLESTER We can leave right after this, right? \nThe HIGH SCHOOL BAND plays \"ON BROADWAY.\" On the gym floor, the girls perform. They're well-rehearsed, but too young to carry off the ambitious Vegas routine they're attempting. \nLester, watching from the stands, picks out his daughter. \nHis POV: Jane performs well, concentrating. Dancing awkwardly next to her is Angela. Suddenly Angela looks right at us and smiles... a lazy, insolent smile. \nLester leans forward in his seat. \nHis POV: We're focused on Angela now. Everything starts to SLOW DOWN... the MUSIC acquires an eerie ECHO... \nWe ZOOM slowly toward Lester as he watches, transfixed. \nHis POV: Angela's awkwardness gives way to a fluid grace, and \"ON BROADWAY\" FADES into dreamy, hypnotic MUSIC. The light on Angela grows stronger, and the other girls DISAPPEAR entirely. \nLester is suddenly alone in the stands, spellbound. \nHis POV: Angela looks directly at us now, dancing only for Lester. Her movements take on a blatantly erotic edge as she starts to unzip her uniform, teasing us with an expression that's both innocent and knowing, then... she pulls her uniform OPEN and a profusion of RED ROSE PETALS spill forth... and we SMASH CUT TO: \nINT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS \nAngela, fully clothed, is once again surrounded by the other girls. The HIGH SCHOOL BAND plays its last note, the Dancing Spartanettes strike their final pose, and the audience APPLAUDS. \nCarolyn claps along with the rest of the audience. Lester just sits there, unable to take his eyes off Angela. \nEXT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - LATER \nThe game is long over. Jane and Angela come out of the gym. \nJANE Oh shit, they're still here. \nHer POV: Lester and Carolyn stand at the edge of the parking lot. \nLESTER Janie! \nCAROLYN Hi! I really enjoyed that! \nShe crosses reluctantly toward her parents, followed by Angela. \nLESTER Congratulations, honey, you were great. \nJANE I didn't win anything. \nLESTER (to Angela) Hi, I'm Lester. Janie's dad. \nANGELA Oh. Hi. \nAn awkward beat. \nJANE This is my friend, Angela Hayes. \nLESTER Okay, good to meet you. You were also good tonight. Very... precise. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nEXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nOn VIDEO: Jane gets out of the car, still LAUGHING, and waves as Angela pulls away. We ZOOM toward Jane as she walks up the driveway. She turns suddenly, sensing our presence. \nHer POV: We're looking at the COLONIAL HOUSE next door where the moving van was parked earlier. The front porch is shrouded in darkness... then a PORCH LIGHT abruptly reveals Ricky. As usual, he's dressed conservatively. There is a BEEPER attached to his belt, and his DIGICAM dangles loosely around his neck. \nIrritated, Jane stares at him, hard. \nJANE Asshole. \nHe looks back at her curiously, then raises his Digicam and starts to videotape her. \nHis POV, on VIDEO: Jane, angry and self-conscious, turns and walks quickly toward her house, flipping us off as she goes. \nINT. BURNHAM HOUSE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS \nJane enters, closes and locks the door. She quickly TURNS OFF THE LIGHT that's been left on for her, then peeks through a window. \nHer POV: There's no sign of Ricky. \nJane turns back into the room, her heart racing... and smiles. \nINT. BURNHAM HOUSE - JANE'S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING \nCLOSE on an ADDRESS BOOK: A man's hand flips to the H page and then his finger stops at the name Angela Hayes. \nLester, dressed for work, goes through Jane's address book. We HEAR the SHOWER running in the adjacent bathroom. He grabs Jane's phone and dials, then stands with the receiver to his ear, nervous. \nANGELA (over phone line) Hello? Hello? \nLester is frozen, unable to speak. Suddenly, the SHOWER is turned off in the next room. Lester hangs up and exits quickly. A moment, then the PHONE RINGS. Jane emerges from the bathroom, a towel wrapped around her torso, drying her wet hair. She picks up the PHONE. \nJANE Hello? \nINT. HAYES HOUSE - ANGELA'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nAngela is sprawled across her bed, on the phone. \nANGELA Why'd you call me? \nINTERCUT WITH JANE IN HER BEDROOM: \nJANE I didn't. \nANGELA Well, my phone just rang and I answered it and somebody hung up and then I star sixty-nined and it called you back. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJANE I was in the shower. \nThen Jane notices her address book open to the H page. \nJANE (CONT'D) Oh, gross. \nEXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nOn VIDEO: We're across from Jane's WINDOW, looking in. Jane picks up the address book, frowning. She speaks into the phone, but we can't hear her. \nWOMAN'S VOICE (O.C.) (sing song) Rick-y! Break-fast! \nINT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nRicky stands at his window, videotaping. He lowers his Digicam, but his eyes remain locked on Jane across the way. \nRICKY Be right there. \nINT. FITTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER \nBARBARA FITTS stands at the stove, flipping bacon strips mechanically, her eyes focused elsewhere. At least ten years younger than her husband, she's pretty in a June Cleaver-ish way. The Colonel sits at a dinette reading The Wall Street Journal. Ricky enters. \nRICKY Mom. \nStartled, Barbara turns to him. \nBARBARA Hello. \nAs she attempts to serve him bacon: \nRICKY I don't eat bacon, remember? \nRICKY Yeah, you're right. \nThe Colonel's eyes flash angrily. \nCOLONEL Don't placate me like I'm your mother, boy. \nRicky sighs, then looks at his father. \nRICKY Forgive me, sir, for speaking so bluntly, but those fags make me want to puke my fucking guts out. \nThe Colonel is taken aback but quickly covers. \nCOLONEL Me too, son. Me too. \nCase closed, Ricky goes back to his calculations. \nCLOSE on the pencil in his hands: He's totaling two columns of NUMBERS. Under the column \"Income\" he writes in swift, bold strokes: $24,950.00. \nEXT. HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUS - A SHORT TIME LATER \nJane and Angela are standing with two other TEENAGE GIRLS. \nANGELA I'm serious, he just pulled down his pants and yanked it out. You know, like, say hello to Mr. Happy. \nTEENAGE GIRL #1 \nGross. \nANGELA It wasn't gross. It was kind of cool. \nTEENAGE GIRL #1 \nSo, did you do it with him? \nANGELA Of course I did. He is a really well- known photographer? He shoots for Elle on like, a regular basis? It would have been so majorly stupid of me to turn him down. \nTEENAGE GIRL #2 \nYou are a total prostitute. \nANGELA Hey. That's how things really are. You just don't know, because you're this pampered little suburban chick. \nTEENAGE GIRL #2 \nSo are you. You've only been in Seventeen once, and you looked fat, so stop acting like you're goddamn Christy Turlington. \nThe two TEENAGE GIRLS move away from Jane and Angela. \nANGELA (calling off) Cunt! (then) I am so sick of people taking their insecurities out on me. \nThe Colonel's Ford Explorer pulls up, and Ricky gets out. \nJANE Oh my God. That's the pervert who filmed me last night. \nANGELA Him? Jane. No way. He's a total lunatic. \nJANE You know him? \nANGELA Yeah. We were on the same lunch shift when I was in ninth grade, and he would always say the most random, weird things, and then one day, he was just like, gone. And then, Connie Cardullo told me he his parents had to put him in a mental institution. \nJANE Why? What did he do? \nANGELA What do you mean? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJANE Well, they can't put you away just for saying weird things. \nAngela stares at Jane, then her mouth widens into a smile. \nANGELA You total slut. You've got a crush on him. \nJANE What? Please. \nANGELA You were defending him! You love him. You want to have like, ten thousand of his babies. \nJANE Shut up. \nJane suddenly finds Ricky standing in front of her. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nCAROLYN Very well, thank you. (to his wife) Hello, Christy. \nCHRISTY Hello. \nCAROLYN My husband, Lester-- \nBUDDY (shakes Lester's hand) It's a pleasure. \nLESTER Oh, we've met before, actually. This thing last year. Or the Christmas thing at the Sheraton. \nBUDDY Oh, yes. \nLESTER It's okay. I wouldn't remember me either. \nHe LAUGHS. A little too loudly. Carolyn quickly joins in. \nCAROLYN (forced gaiety) Honey. Don't be weird. \nShe smiles her most winning smile at him. He knows this persona well, only it's never pissed him off as much as it does right now. \nLESTER All right, honey. I won't be weird. (his face close to hers) I'll be whatever you want me to be. \nAnd he kisses her--a soft, warm kiss that speaks unmistakably of sex--then turns to the others and grins. \nLESTER (CONT'D) We have a very healthy relationship. \nBUDDY I see. \nCarolyn's smile is frozen on her face. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nLESTER Well. I don't know about you, but I need a drink. \nHe crosses off. Carolyn, Buddy and Christy watch him go. \nINT. HOTEL BALLROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nLester stands at the bar. A bartender pours him a drink. \nLESTER Whoa. Put a little more in there, cowboy. \nThe bartender complies. Lester takes his drink and turns to face the center of the room. \nHis POV: Carolyn is talking to Buddy and Christy. She's on: smiling, animated, LAUGHING too loud at their jokes. \nLester shakes his head. Ricky approaches him, wearing a waiter's uniform, carrying a tray of empty glasses. \nRICKY Excuse me. Don't you live on Robin Hood Trail? The house with the red door? \nLESTER (suspicious) Yeah. \nRICKY I'm Ricky Fitts. I just moved into the house next to you. \nLESTER Oh. Hi, Ricky Fitts. I'm Lester Burnham. \nRICKY Hi, Lester Burnham. \nA beat. Lester looks away, scans the crowd, then downs the rest of his drink in one gulp. Ricky just stands there, watching him. Finally Lester turns back to Ricky: what does this kid want? \nRICKY (CONT'D) Do you party? \nLESTER Excuse me? \nRICKY Do you get high? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLester's surprised, but instantly intrigued. \nINT. HOTEL BALLROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nCarolyn and Buddy are deep in conversation. Christy has wandered off. Carolyn is nervous; Buddy seems amused. \nShe starts toward the kitchen. Jane doesn't like this. \nINT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nLester enters and opens the refrigerator. \nANGELA (O.C.) Nice suit. \nHe turns, and is instantly transfixed by: \nHis POV: Angela leans against the counter, twirling her hair. \nANGELA (CONT'D) You're looking good, Mr. Burnham. \nShe starts toward him. \nANGELA (CONT'D) Last time I saw you, you looked kind of wound up. (spots something) Ooh, is that root beer? \nShe reaches inside the refrigerator to grab a bottle. As she does, she moves to place her other hand casually on Lester's shoulder. He sees it coming. Everything SLOWS DOWN, and all sound FADES... \nEXTREME CLOSE UP on her hand as it briefly touches his shoulder in SLOW MOTION. We HEAR only the amplified BRUSH of her fingers against the fabric of his suit, and its unnatural, hollow ECHO... \nBACK IN REAL TIME: She grabs the root beer and smiles at him. \nCLOSE on Lester: his eyes narrow slightly, then: \nHe cups her face in his hands and kisses her. She seems shocked, but doesn't resist as he pulls her toward him    with surprising strength. He breaks the kiss, looking at her    in awe, then he reaches up and touches his lips. His eyes    widen as he pulls a ROSE PETAL from his mouth right before we    SMASH CUT TO: \nINT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nAngela is back against the counter, drinking the root beer. Lester stands by the refrigerator, gazing at her, still lost in fantasy. \nANGELA I love root beer, don't you? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJane watches from the doorway to the family room, feeling incredibly awkward in her own home. Carolyn enters from the dining room. Lester snaps out of it and grabs a root beer from the refrigerator. \nJANE Mom, you remember Angela. \nCAROLYN (her sales smile) Yes, of course! \nJANE I forgot to tell you, she's spending the night. Is that okay? \nLESTER Sure! \nHe takes a sip of his root beer, but it goes down the wrong way and he starts COUGHING violently. \nINT. BURNHAM HOUSE - JANE'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT \nAngela lays on the bed, in bra and panties, reading a magazine. Jane, in an oversized T shirt, plays a video game on her computer. \nJANE I'm sorry about my dad. \nANGELA Don't be. I think it's funny. \nJANE Yeah, to you, he's just another guy who wants to jump your bones. But to me... he's just too embarrassing to live. \nANGELA Your mom's the one who's embarrassing. What a phony. \nJane glances at Angela, irritated. \nANGELA (CONT'D) Your dad's actually kind of cute. \nJANE Shut up. \nINT. BURNHAM HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nLester, still in his suit, stands outside Jane's room, his ear up against the door. He can't believe what he's hearing. \nANGELA (O.C.) He is. If he just worked out a little, he'd be hot. \nINT. BURNHAM HOUSE - JANE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nJANE Shut up. \nANGELA Oh, come on. Like you've never sneaked a peek at him in his underwear? I bet he's got a big dick. \nJANE You are so grossing me out right now. \nRicky stands at the window, videotaping. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRICKY Welcome to America's Weirdest Home Videos. \nSuddenly we HEAR someone trying to open a locked door. \nCOLONEL (O.C.) Ricky! \nMoving swiftly, Ricky pulls the drapes shut and switches on a light. His room is a haven of high-tech. A state-of-the-art multimedia COMPUTER crowds his desk, and high-end STEREO and VIDEO EQUIPMENT line the shelves, as well as HUNDREDS OF CDs. There is easily twenty thousand dollars worth of equipment in this room. \nRICKY Coming, Dad. \nCOLONEL (O.C.) You know I don't like locked doors in my house, boy. \nRicky opens the door. The Colonel stands outside, eyeing him. \nRICKY I'm sorry, I must have locked it by accident. So what's up? \nThe Colonel holds out a small PLASTIC CUP WITH A CAP. \nCOLONEL I need a urine sample. \nRICKY Wow. It's been six months already. Can I give it to you in the morning? I just took a whiz. \nCOLONEL Yeah, I suppose. (an awkward beat) Well. Good night, son. \nHe disappears down the hall. Ricky smiles, shuts and locks his door. He puts the plastic cup on the shelf, then crosses to a MINI REFRIGERATOR in the corner of his room and takes out a cup-sized TUPPERWARE CONTAINER from the freezer, already filled with urine, albeit frozen, and places it on a saucer to thaw overnight. \nINT BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT \nCarolyn lies sleeping. Lester is awake, staring at the ceiling. After a moment, he gets up, taking care not to disturb Carolyn, and walks toward the bathroom. \nINT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BATH - CONTINUOUS \nLester enters and switches on the LIGHT. The room is filled with STEAM. Lester looks around, confused, then focuses on: \nHis POV: Across from us, in a PEDESTAL BATHTUB, is Angela. She smiles and beckons us, and we MOVE CLOSER. ROSE PETALS float on the surface of the water, obscuring her naked body. \nANGELA I've been waiting for you. \nLester kneels by the bathtub like a man in church. \nANGELA (CONT'D) You've been working out, haven't you? I can tell. \nShe arches her back and looks up at him provocatively. \nANGELA (CONT'D) I was hoping you'd give me a bath... I'm very, very dirty. \nLester gives her a hard look, then slowly slips his hand into the water between her legs. Her eyes widen and she throws her head back... and we SMASH CUT TO: \nINT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nCLOSE on Carolyn, her eyes wide, listening to the rhythmic BRUSH of Lester's hand as he masturbates under the covers. \nShe flips over and faces him. \nCAROLYN What are you doing? \nA beat. \nLESTER Nothing. \nCarolyn switches on the bedside LIGHT. \nCAROLYN You were masturbating. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLESTER I was not. \nCAROLYN Yes, you were. \nHe turns to her, trying to look innocent, then gives up. \nLESTER All right, so shoot me. I was whacking off. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCOLONEL (shakes) COLONEL Frank Fitts, U.S. Marine Corps. \nLESTER Whoa. Welcome to the neighborhood, sir. \nHe salutes the Colonel good-naturedly, grinning. The Colonel doesn't think it's funny. An awkward beat. \nLESTER (CONT'D) So, Ricky, uh, I was thinking about the, uh... I was gonna... the movie we talked about... \nRICKY (quickly) Re-Animator. \nLESTER Yeah! \nRICKY You want to borrow it? (before Lester can answer) Okay, it's up in my room. Come on. \nHe heads into the house. Lester waves at the Colonel, then follows him. The Colonel watches them go, his eyes dark. \nINT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nRicky enters, followed by Lester. \nRICKY Can you hold this for a sec? \nLESTER Sure. \nHe gives the URINE SPECIMEN to Lester, then locks the door. \nRICKY I don't think my dad would try to come in when somebody else is here, but you never know. \nRicky crosses to a bureau and opens a DRAWER. He takes clothing out and piles it on his bed. \nLESTER (re: urine sample) What is this? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRICKY Urine. I have to take a drug test every six months to make sure I'm clean. \nLESTER Are you kidding? You just smoked with me last night. \nRICKY It's not mine. One of my clients is a nurse in a pediatrician's office. I cut her a deal, she keeps me in clean piss. \nLester picks up a CD case from a shelf and examines it. \nLESTER You like Pink Floyd? \nRICKY I like a lot of music. \nLESTER Man, I haven't listened to this album in years. \nHe shakes his head, then puts the CD case down. Ricky, having emptied the drawer, now removes a FALSE BOTTOM, revealing rows of MARIJUANA, tightly packed in ZIP-LOC BAGS. \nRICKY How much do you want? \nLESTER I don't know, it's been a while. How much is an ounce? \nRICKY (indicates bag) Well, this is totally decent, and it's three hundred. \nLESTER Wow. \nRICKY (indicates another bag) But this shit is top of the line. It's called G-13. Genetically engineered by the U.S. Government. Extremely potent. But a completely mellow high, no paranoia. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nLESTER Is that what we smoked last night? \nRICKY This is all I ever smoke. \nLESTER How much? \nRICKY Two grand. \nLESTER Jesus. Things have changed since 1973. \nRICKY You don't have to pay now. I know you're good for it. \nLESTER One year's salary, with benefits. \nBRAD That's not going to happen. \nLESTER Well, what do you say I throw in a little sexual harassment charge to boot? \nBrad LAUGHS. \nBRAD Against who? \nLESTER Against you. \nBrad stops laughing. \nLESTER (CONT'D) Can you prove you didn't offer to save my job if I'd let you blow me? \nBrad leans back in his chair, studying Lester. \nBRAD Man. You are one twisted fuck. \nLESTER (standing) Nope. I'm just an ordinary guy with nothing to lose. \nINT. OFFICE BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER \nExhilarated, Lester walks down a corridor, his belongings in a box on his shoulder. He's happier than he's been in years. \nLESTER Yeah! \nINT. RESTAURANT - LATER THAT DAY \nCarolyn sits at a table, lost in thought. There are two menus on the table. After a moment, Buddy Kane, the Real Estate King, joins her. Carolyn immediately becomes warm and gracious. \nBUDDY Carolyn. \nCAROLYN Buddy. \nCarolyn smiles, genuinely touched that he remembers her name. \nBUDDY I'm so sorry I kept you waiting. Christy left for New York this morning, and... let's just say things were very hectic around the house. \nCAROLYN What's she doing in New York? \nBUDDY She's moving there. (off Carolyn's look) Yes. We are splitting up. \nCAROLYN Buddy. I'm so sorry. \nBUDDY (bitterly) Yes, according to her, I'm too focused on my career. As if being driven to succeed is some sort of character flaw. Well, she certainly knew how to take advantage of the lifestyle my success afforded her. Oh. Wow. (then, laughing) Ah, it's for the best. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCAROLYN When I saw you two at the party the other night, you seemed perfectly happy. \nBUDDY Well, call me crazy, but it is my philosophy that in order to be successful, one must project an image of success, at all times. \nHe smiles, then opens his menu. Carolyn picks hers up mechanically, but continues to stare at him, enraptured, like a fervent Christian who's just come face to face with Jesus. \nEXT. HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUS - LATER THAT DAY \nRicky stands with his DIGICAM, videotaping something on the ground at his feet. \nOn VIDEO: A DEAD BIRD lays on the ground, decomposing. \nANGELA (O.C.) What are you doing? \nOn VIDEO: The camera JERKS up to discover Jane and Angela staring at us. \nRICKY (O.C.) I was filming this dead bird. \nANGELA Why? \nRICKY (O.C.) Because it's beautiful. \nOn VIDEO: Angela looks at Jane, trying not to laugh. \nANGELA I think maybe you forgot your medication today, mental boy. \nOn VIDEO: She falls out of frame as we ZOOM toward Jane. \nRICKY (O.C.) Hi, Jane. \nDRIVE-THRU GIRL (CONT'D) Smile, you're at Mr. Smiley's, that'll be four eighty-nine, please. \nLester pays her. As she hands him his food, he notices a SIGN in the corner of the window that reads: \nNOW TAKING APPLICATIONS \nCOUNTER GIRL Would you like some Smiley Sauce? \nLESTER No. No, actually... I'd like to fill out an application. \nShe stares at him, confused by his age and attire. \nCOUNTER GIRL There's not jobs for manager, it's just for counter. \nLESTER Good. I'm looking for the least possible amount of responsibility. \nINT. MR. SMILEY'S - A SHORT TIME LATER \nLester sits at a booth with the MANAGER, a greasy kid wearing a white short sleeve shirt and a tie covered with the Mr. Smiley's logo. He looks over Lester's application, baffled. \nMANAGER I don't think you'd fit in here. \nLESTER I have fast food experience. \nMANAGER Yeah, like twenty years ago. \nLESTER Well, I'm sure there have been amazing technological advances in the industry, but surely you have some sort of training process. It seems unfair to presume I won't be able to learn. \nThe Manager sighs and runs a hand through his greasy hair, wondering what he could possibly have done to deserve this. \nINT. TOP HAT MOTEL - LATER THAT DAY \nCarolyn and Buddy are in bed, post-sex. \nCAROLYN That was exactly what I needed. The royal treatment, so to speak. \nThey laugh. \nCAROLYN (CONT'D) I was so stressed out. \nBUDDY Know what I do when I feel like that? \nCAROLYN What? \nBUDDY I fire a gun. \nCarolyn sits up, eager to learn from the master. \nCAROLYN (intrigued) Really. \nBUDDY Oh yeah, I go to this little firing range downtown, and I just pop off a few rounds. \nCAROLYN (embarrassed) I've never fired a gun before. \nBUDDY Oh, you've gotta try it. Nothing makes you feel more powerful. (smiles seductively) Well, almost nothing. \nCarolyn is quick to pick up her cue and kisses him, ready for another round. \nEXT. SUBURBAN STREET - LATER THAT DAY \nRicky and Jane walk along without speaking. He seems comfortable with the silence; she doesn't. After a beat: \nJANE So how do you like your new house? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRICKY I like it. \nA beat. \nJANE The people who used to live there fed these stray cats, so they were always around, and it drove my mother nuts. And then she cut down their tree. \nAn automobile FUNERAL PROCESSION appears and begins to pass them slowly. \nRICKY Have you ever known anybody who died? \nJANE No. (a beat) Have you? \nRICKY No, but I did see this homeless woman who froze to death once. Just laying there on the sidewalk. She looked really sad. \nRICKY (concerned) No, you're scared of me. \nJANE No I'm not. \nBut she is. Ricky studies her. \nRICKY You want to see the most beautiful thing I've ever filmed? \nINT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nOn VIDEO: We're in an empty parking lot on a cold, gray day. Something is floating across from us... it's an empty, wrinkled, white PLASTIC BAG. We follow it as the wind carries it in a circle around us, sometimes whipping it about violently, or, without warning, sending it soaring skyward, then letting it float gracefully down to the ground... \nJane and Ricky sit on the bed, watching his WIDE-SCREEN TV. \nRICKY It was one of those days when it's a minute away from snowing. And there's this electricity in the air, you can almost hear it, right? And this bag was just... dancing with me. Like a little kid begging me to play with it. For fifteen minutes. That's the day I realized that there was this entire life behind things, and this incredibly benevolent force that wanted me to know there was no reason to be afraid. Ever. \nA beat. \nRICKY (CONT'D) Video's a poor excuse, I know. But it helps me remember... I need to remember... \nNow Jane is watching him. \nRICKY (CONT'D) (distant) Sometimes there's so much beauty in the world I feel like I can't take it... and my heart is going to cave in. \nAfter a moment, Jane takes his hand. Then she leans in and kisses him softly on the lips. His eyes scan hers, curious to see how she reacts to this... \nJANE (suddenly) Oh my God. What time is it? \nINT. BURNHAM HOUSE - DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nLester sits at the table in sloppy clothes, eating his dinner voraciously and drinking beer from a bottle. Across from him, Carolyn picks at her food, watching him with contempt. EASY- LISTENING MUSIC plays on the STEREO. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nWe HEAR the back door SLAM, then Jane enters and quickly takes her seat at the table. \nJANE Sorry I'm late. \nCAROLYN (overly cheerful) No, no, that's quite all right, dear. Your father and I were just discussing his day at work. (to Lester) Why don't you tell our daughter about it, honey? \nJane stares at both her parents, apprehensive. Lester looks at Carolyn darkly, then flashes a \"you-asked-for-it\" grin. \nLESTER Janie, today I quit my job. And then I told my boss to fuck himself, and then I blackmailed him for almost sixty thousand dollars. Pass the asparagus. \nCAROLYN Your father seems to think this kind of behavior is something to be proud of. \nLESTER And your mother seems to prefer I go through life like a fucking prisoner while she keeps my dick in a mason jar under the sink. \nCAROLYN (ashen) How dare you speak to me that way in front of her? And I marvel that you can be so contemptuous of me, on the same day that you lose your job! \nLESTER Lose it? I didn't lose it. It's not like, \"Oops, where'd my job go?\" I quit. Someone pass me the asparagus. \nCAROLYN Oh! Oh! And I want to thank you for putting me under the added pressure of being the sole breadwinner now-- \nLESTER I already have a job. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nCAROLYN (not stopping) No, no, don't give a second thought as to who's going to pay the mortgage. We'll just leave it all up to Carolyn. You mean, you're going to take care of everything now, Carolyn? Yes. I don't mind. I really don't. You mean, everything? You don't mind having the sole responsibility, your husband feels he can just quit his job-- \nLESTER (overlapping) Will someone pass me the fucking asparagus? \nJANE (rises) Okay, I'm not going to be a part of this-- \nLESTER (means it) Sit down. \nJane does so, surprised and intimidated by the power in his voice. Lester gets up, crosses to the other side of the table to get a PLATE OF ASPARAGUS, then sits again as he serves himself. \nLESTER (CONT'D) I'm sick and tired of being treated    like I don't exist. You two do whatever    you want to do whenever you want to do    it and I don't complain. All I want is the    same courtesy-- \nCAROLYN (overlapping) Oh, you don't complain? Oh, excuse me. Excuse me. I must be psychotic then, if you don't complain. What is this?! Am I locked away in a padded cell somewhere, hallucinating? That's the only explanation I can think of-- \nLester hurls the plate of asparagus against the wall with such force it SHATTERS, frightening Carolyn and Jane. \nLESTER (casual) Don't interrupt me, honey. \n(CONTINUED) \nRICKY No, sir. I wanted to show my girlfriend your Nazi plate. \nA beat. \nCOLONEL Girlfriend? \nRICKY Yes, sir. She lives next door. \nThe Colonel glances toward the window. \nHis POV: In the WINDOW across from us, Jane peeks out from behind the drape. She quickly pulls it shut. \nRICKY (CONT'D) Her name's Jane. \nA beat. The Colonel is suddenly, deeply shamed. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCOLONEL This is for your own good, boy. You have no respect for other people's things, for authority, for... \nRICKY Sir, I'm sorry. \nCOLONEL You can't just go around doing whatever you feel like, you can't--there are rules in life-- \nRICKY Yes, sir. \nCOLONEL You need structure, you need discipline-- \nRICKY (simultaneous) Discipline. Yes, sir, thank you for trying to teach me. Don't give up on me, Dad. \nThe Colonel stands, still breathing heavily. Tenderness fills his face, and he reaches out to touch Ricky's cheek. \nCOLONEL Oh, Ricky... \nBut something keeps him from doing it. \nCOLONEL (CONT'D) You stay out of there. \nHe leaves. Ricky gets up and goes to his bureau. He looks at his reflection in the mirror, calmly takes a cloth and starts to wipe the blood from his face. \nFADE TO BLACK. \nIn darkness, we HEAR repetitive GUNSHOTS. \nFADE IN: \nINT. INDOOR FIRING RANGE - ONE MONTH LATER \nCarolyn, wearing PROTECTIVE HEADGEAR, is holding a GLOCK 19 AUTOMATIC REVOLVER with both hands, FIRING it directly at us. \nShe empties a round and stands there, exhilarated. An ATTENDANT approaches with a new round of ammunition. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nATTENDANT (loading gun) I gotta say, Mrs. Burnham, when you first came here I thought you would be hopeless. But you're a natural. \nCAROLYN Well, all I know is... I love shooting this gun! \nAnd she starts FIRING again. \nINT. MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 - LATER \nBobby Darin sings \"DON'T RAIN ON MY    PARADE\" on the RADIO. Carolyn SINGS along as she drives.    Her face has lost its usual resolute determination; she's    actually enjoying herself spontaneously, and the lack of her    usual self-consciousness allows us to see just how beautiful    she is. \nANGLE ON the GLOCK 19 sitting on the passenger seat amidst some CDs. \nCarolyn takes the gun and holds it at arm's length, admiring it as she continues to SING. \nEXT. ROBIN HOOD TRAIL - CONTINUOUS \nThe Mercedes turns onto Robin Hood Trail. \nINT. MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 - CONTINUOUS \nCarolyn's POV: We turn into the Burnham driveway. A 1970 PONTIAC FIREBIRD with racing stripes blocks our access to the garage. \nCLOSE on Carolyn: She doesn't like having things in her way. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCLOSE on the Colonel's face: he looks confused. \nAs the Mercedes backs out of the driveway, Lester glances over at him. \nLester's POV: The Colonel watches the car driving off, then looks at us. His face tightens. \nLESTER studies him for a moment, then grins and salutes before going inside the house. \nCLOSE on the Colonel, deeply troubled. \nINT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nThe door swings open silently and the Colonel enters. He starts going through Ricky's bureau. He opens the DRAWER in which we know Ricky keeps his marijuana, but he doesn't discover its false bottom. He stands and looks around, his eyes finally landing on: \nThe DIGICAM and a stack of CASSETTES on a shelf. The camera is still connected to the TV. \nThe Colonel turns on the TV, examines the Digicam and presses \"play.\" The TV's blank screen suddenly gives way to... \nOn VIDEO: Barbara Fitts sits at the kitchen table, staring off into space. \nThe Colonel watches, at first baffled, then impatient. He takes the cassette out of the Digicam and inserts another. On the TV screen we see... \nOn VIDEO: Through the Burnham's GARAGE WINDOW, we see Lester step out of his pants and briefs. Then, naked except for his black socks, he grabs the dumbbells and starts lifting them, watching his reflection in the window as he does... \nThe Colonel sinks slowly onto Ricky's bed, mesmerized. \nINT. MR. SMILEY'S - LATER \nLester, wearing a Mr. Smiley's uniform, is happily flipping burgers on a grill. \nCO-WORKER Hey Lester, I need that Super Smiley with cheese, A.S.A.P. \nLESTER You need more than that, my little hombre. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLester looks up suddenly when he HEARS: \nCAROLYN (O.S.) (over speakers) What's good here? \nBUDDY (O.C.) (over speakers) Nothing. \nCAROLYN (O.C.) (over speakers) Then I guess we'll just have to be bad, won't we? (then) I think I'll have a double Smiley Sandwich and curly fries, and a vanilla shake. \nBUDDY (O.C.) (over speakers) Make that two. \nCOUNTER GIRL (O.C.) (over speakers) Please drive around thank you. \nLester's face darkens, then... he smiles. He puts his spatula down. \nEXT. MR. SMILEY'S - CONTINUOUS \nThe Mercedes pulls around to the DRIVE-THRU WINDOW. Carolyn drives; Buddy sits beside her. \nCAROLYN I think we deserve a little junk food, after the workout we had this morning. \nBUDDY (nuzzles her neck) I'm flattered. \nThey are too involved with each other to notice Lester watching them from the drive-thru window. \nLESTER (overly cheerful) Smile! You're at Mr. Smiley's! \nCarolyn almost jumps out of her skin. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLester leans out of the drive-thru window, grinning at her, holding bags filled with fast food. The Counter Girl stands next to him, staring blankly. \nLESTER    (CONT'D) Would you like to    try our new beef and cheese pot pie on    a stick, just a dollar ninety-nine for a    limited time only? \nCarolyn struggles to appear nonchalant. \nCAROLYN (re: Buddy) We were just at a seminar. (then, all business) Buddy, this is my-- \nCONTINUED: \nJANE Yeah, and maybe you shouldn't, all right? Maybe I don't really want to hear all that. \nANGELA Oh, so now that you have a boyfriend, you're like, above it? (rolls her eyes) We gotta get you a real man. \nINT. FITTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nThe Colonel rinses off his plate at the sink. Something outside catches his eye, and he cranes his neck to get a better look at... \nHis POV: Through the window over the sink, we can see into the Burnham's GARAGE WINDOW. Our view is blurred by the RAIN, but we see Lester, his upper body pumped and glistening in sweat as he counts out a wad of BILLS... and then Ricky walks into view. \nThe Colonel's face tightens. \nHis POV: Lester drapes his arm around Ricky as he gives him the money. We can only see Lester from the waist up, so he looks naked. \nINT. BURNHAM HOUSE - GARAGE - CONTINUOUS \nRicky, his hair wet from the rain, puts the cash in his pocket. Lester's arm remains draped around his shoulder. \nRICKY (grins) You got any papers? \nLESTER Yeah, in the cigar box, right over there. (laughs) You know, put up a fight, dude! You are such a pushover. \"No I can't. Really. Okay.\" \nAnd he slaps Ricky playfully on the chest. Ricky grins, then squats down and reaches under the weight bench. \nRICKY You should learn to roll a joint. \nLester sits in the bowl chair and leans back, his hands behind his head, watching Ricky roll the joint. \nINT. FITTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nThe Colonel's POV: Lester leans back in his chair. We see only Ricky's back and shoulders as he rolls the joint. After a beat, Lester's jaw drops, then he throws his head back. From our perspective, it looks very much like Ricky is giving Lester a blow job. \nThe Colonel watches, incredulous. Then we HEAR a CAR APPROACHING, and the Colonel glances over at: \nHis POV: Angela's BMW pulls into the driveway, stopping behind Lester's Firebird. As Angela and Jane get out and run toward the house, our focus MOVES back to the GARAGE WINDOW. Ricky stands, looking a little panicked. Lester pulls on his T-shirt, and both he and Ricky cross out of view. \nINT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER \nLester leans nonchalantly against the counter. Jane and Angela enter. Jane frowns when she sees him. \nLESTER Oh. Hi. \nJANE Where's Mom? \nLESTER Don't know. \nANGELA Hi, Mr. Burnham. \nLESTER Hi. \nHe's trying to remain cool, and doing a pretty good job. \nANGELA Wow. Look at you. Have you been working out? \nLESTER Some. \nJane rolls her eyes and exits. Angela walks over to Lester. \nANGELA You can really tell. Look at those arms. \nShe places her hand on his arm flirtatiously, looks up at him and smiles, fully expecting to intimidate him by doing so. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBut something has changed, and he isn't intimidated at all. He looks directly back at her, leans in and smiles slowly. \nLESTER You like muscles? \nHis voice is low and intense. She moves away, suddenly insecure. \nANGELA I--I should probably go see what Jane's up to. \nAnd she heads out quickly. Lester watches her go, baffled. \nINT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nRicky enters, wet from the pouring rain, and crosses to his bureau, pulling the wad of CASH out of his pocket as he goes. \nThe MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 is parked in the breakdown lane, its HAZARD LIGHTS BLINKING. Cars ZOOM past in the rain. \nINT. MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 - CONTINUOUS \nCarolyn sits behind the wheel, listening to a MOTIVATIONAL TAPE on the STEREO. \nTAPE VOICE --disinvesting problems of their power, and removing their ability to make us afraid. This is the secret to \"me- centered\" living. (MORE) (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: TAPE VOICE (CONT'D) Only by taking full responsibility for your problems--and their solutions--will you ever be able to break free from the constant cycle of victimhood. \nCarolyn leans over and open the glove compartment. She takes out her GLOCK 19. \nTAPE VOICE (CONT'D) Remember, you are only a victim if you choose to be a victim... \nINT. BURNHAM HOUSE - JANE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nAngela is sprawled across the bed. Jane stands across the room from her. \nJANE I don't think we could be friends anymore. \nANGELA You are way too uptight about sex. \nJANE Just don't fuck my dad, all right? Please? \nANGELA Why not? \nThere is a KNOCK on the door. Jane sits up, alarmed. \nJANE (angry) Dad! Leave us alone! \nRICKY (O.C.) It's me. \nJane jumps up and opens the door and lets him in. \nRICKY (CONT'D) (to Jane) If I had to leave tonight, would you come with me? \nJANE What? \nRICKY If I had to go to New York. To live. Tonight. Would you come with me? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJANE Yes. \nANGELA You guys can't be serious. (to Jane) You're just a kid. And he's like, a mental case. You'll end up living in a box on the street. \nJANE I'm no more a kid than you are! ( to Ricky) We can use my plastic surgery money. \nRICKY We won't have to. I have over forty thousand dollars. And I know people in the city who can help us get set up. \nANGELA What, other drug dealers? \nRICKY Yes. \nANGELA Jane, you'd be out of your mind to go with him. \nJANE Why do you even care? \nANGELA Because you're my friend! \nRICKY She's not your friend. She's somebody you use to feel better about yourself. \nANGELA Go fuck yourself, psycho! \nJANE You shut up, bitch! \nANGELA Jane! He is a freak! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nJANE Well, then so am I! And we'll always be freaks and we'll never be like other people. And you'll never be a freak because you're just too perfect. \nANGELA Oh, yeah? Well, at least I'm not ugly. \nRICKY Yes, you are. And you're boring. And you're totally ordinary. And you know it. \nAngela stares at him, stunned, then starts toward the door. \nThe Colonel stares at the floor, blinking, and then he turns and runs out the open garage door into the rainy night. \nINT. MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 - CONTINUOUS \nCarolyn is still listening to the same MOTIVATIONAL TAPE. She holds the GLOCK in her hand. \nTAPE VOICE \"I refuse to be a victim.\" When this becomes your mantra, constantly running through your head-- \nCarolyn switches the TAPE OFF and puts the gun in her purse. \nCAROLYN I refuse to be a victim. \nEXT. FREEWAY - CONTINUOUS \nThe Mercedes pulls away from the shoulder. \nINT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nLester enters, opens the refrigerator and grabs a BEER. Suddenly we HEAR MUSIC coming from the other room. Lester opens his beer and starts toward the family room. \nINT. BURNHAM HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nHis POV: AS we MOVE SLOWLY around a corner, Angela comes into view, standing at the STEREO, holding a CD case. She's been crying; her face is puffy, and her hair mussed. She regards us apprehensively... then puts on a slightly defiant smile. \nANGELA I hope you don't mind if I play the stereo. \nLester leans against the wall and takes a swig of his beer. \nLESTER Not at all. (then) Bad night? \nANGELA Not really bad, just... strange. \nLESTER (grins) Believe me. It couldn't possibly be any stranger than mine. \nShe smiles. They stand there in silence; the atmosphere is charged. \nANGELA Jane and I had a fight. (after a beat) It was about you. \nShe's trying to be seductive as she says this, but she's pretty bad at it. Lester raises his eyebrows. \nANGELA (CONT'D) She's mad at me because I said I think you're sexy. \nLester grins. He is sexy. \nLESTER (offering beer) Do you want a sip? \nShe nods. Lester holds the bottle up to her mouth and she drinks clumsily. He gently wipes her chin with the back of his hand. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLESTER (CONT'D) So... are you going to tell me? What you want? \nANGELA I don't know. \nLESTER You don't know? \nHis face is very close to hers. She's unnerved--this is happening too fast... \nANGELA What do you want? \nLESTER Are you kidding? I want you. I've wanted you since the first moment I saw you. You are the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. \nAngela takes a deep breath just before Lester leans in to kiss her cheek, her forehead, her eyelids, her neck... \nANGELA You don't think I'm ordinary? \nLESTER You couldn't be ordinary if you tried. \nANGELA Thank you. (far away) I don't think there's anything worse than being ordinary... \nAnd Lester kisses her on the lips. \nINT. MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 - CONTINUOUS \nCarolyn drives, her face resolute. \nCAROLYN I refuse to be a victim. I refuse to be a victim. I refuse to be a victim...

She's sixteen, with dark, intense eyes. \nJANE I need a father who's a role model, not some horny geek-boy who's gonna spray his shorts whenever I bring a girlfriend home from school. (snorts) What a lame-o. Somebody really should put him out of his misery. \nHer mind wanders for a beat. \nRICKY (O.C.)

This is my street. This... is my life. I'm forty-two years old. In less than a year, I'll be dead. \nINT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nWe're looking down at a king-sized BED from OVERHEAD: \nLESTER BURNHAM lies sleeping amidst expensive bed linens, face down, wearing PAJAMAS. An irritating ALARM CLOCK RINGS. Lester gropes blindly to shut it off. \nLESTER (V.O.) Of course, I don't know that yet. He rolls over, looks up at us and sighs. He doesn't seem too thrilled at the prospect of a new day. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D) And in a way, I'm dead already. \nHe sits up and puts on his slippers. \nINT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BATH - MOMENTS LATER \nLester thrusts his face directly into a steaming hot shower. \nANGLE from outside the shower: Lester's naked body is silhouetted through the fogged-up glass door. It becomes apparent he is masturbating. \nLESTER (V.O.) (amused) Look at me, jerking off in the shower. (then) This will be the high point of my day. It's all downhill from here. \nEXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER \nCLOSE on a single, dewy AMERICAN BEAUTY ROSE. A gloved hand with CLIPPERS appears and SNIPS the flower off. \nCAROLYN BURNHAM tends her rose bushes in front of the Burnham house. A very well-put together woman of forty, she wears color-coordinated gardening togs and has lots of useful and expensive tools. \nLester watches her through a WINDOW on the first floor, peeping out through the drapes. \nLESTER (V.O.) That's my wife Carolyn. See the way the handle on those pruning shears matches her gardening clogs? That's not an accident. \nEXT. JIMS' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nIn the fenced front yard of the house next door, a dog BARKS repeatedly. A MAN in a conservative suit (JIM #1) chastises the barking dog. \nJIM #1 Hush, Bitsy. You hush.

Egg shells and Miracle Grow. \nJim #1 and Carolyn continue to chat, unaware that Lester is watching them. \nLESTER (V.O.) Man. I get exhausted just watching her. \nLester's POV: We can't hear what Jim and Carolyn are saying, but she's overly animated, like a TV talk show host. \nLESTER (V.O.)

Jane stuffs items into her BACKPACK. \nLESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D) But I don't want to lie to her. \nWe HEAR the CAR HORN again from outside.

Both my wife and daughter think I'm this gigantic loser, and... they're right. \nINT. MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 - A SHORT TIME LATER \nCarolyn is driving; Jane stares out the window. Lester is asleep in the back seat. \nLESTER (V.O.) I have lost something. I'm not exactly sure what it is, but I know I didn't always feel this... sedated. But you know what? It's never too late to get it back. \nINT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY \nLester sits at his workstation, a BEIGE CUBICLE surrounded by IDENTICAL BEIGE CUBICLES. He's staring at a computer monitor and talking on a HEADSET PHONE. The beleaguered expression on his face is at odds with the light, friendly tone of his voice. \nLESTER Hello, this is Lester Burnham from Media Monthly magazine, I'm calling for Mr. Tamblin, please?... Well, we're all under a deadline here, uh, but you see, there is some basic information about the product launch that isn't even covered in your press release and I... Yeah. Can I ask you a question?

If they hadn't pulled me off. (then) That's when my dad put me in the hospital. Then they drugged me up and left me in there for two years. \nJANE Wow. You must really hate him. \nRICKY He's not a bad man. \nHe grabs a half-smoked JOINT from an ashtray and lights it. \nJANE Well... you better believe I'd hate my father if he did something like that to me. (laughs) Wait. I do hate my father. \nRICKY Why? \nHe passes her the joint, then takes the Digicam and focuses it on her. We see her image on the TV as he videotapes. \nJANE He's a total asshole and he's got this crush on my friend Angela and it's disgusting. \nRICKY You'd rather he had the crush on you? \nJANE Gross, no! But it'd be nice if I was anywhere near as important to him as she is. (then) (MORE) (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) JANE (CONT'D) I know you think my dad's harmless, but you're wrong. He's doing massive psychological damage to me. \nRICKY How? \nJane looks into the camera, a loopy, stoned grin on her face. \nJANE Well, now, I too need structure. A little fucking discipline. \nThey LAUGH. She lays back on the bed. \nJANE (CONT'D) I'm serious, though. How could he not be damaging me? I need a father who's a role model, not some horny geek-boy who's gonna spray his shorts whenever I bring a girlfriend home from school. (snorts) What a lame-o. Somebody really should put him out of his misery. \nHer mind wanders for a beat. \nRICKY Want me to kill him for you? \nJane looks at him and sits up. \nJANE Yeah, would you? \nRICKY (smiles) It'll cost you. \nJANE Well, I've been baby-sitting since I was about ten. I've got almost three thousand dollars. 'Course, I was saving it up for a boob job. \nShe stands and sticks out her breasts, then falls back on the bed, LAUGHING. \nJANE (CONT'D) But my tits can wait, huh? \nRICKY You know, that's not a very nice thing to do, hiring somebody to kill your dad. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (4) \nJANE Well, I guess I'm just not a very nice girl, then, am I? \nShe smiles dreamily at him. He turns the Digicam off and the TV screen goes BLUE. He lowers the camera and looks at her intently. \n", "test2_true": "RICKY Of course. \nHe puts the Digicam down and joins Jane on the bed. A long moment where neither of them speaks. He caresses her hair, gazing into her eyes. \nRICKY (CONT'D) Do you know how lucky we are to have found each other? \nFADE TO BLACK. \nFADE IN: \nEXT. ROBIN HOOD TRAIL - EARLY MORNING \nWe're FLYING above Robin Hood Trail. We see the BURNHAM'S HOUSE below us as we APPROACH it steadily. \nLESTER Remember those posters that said, \"Today is the first day of the rest of your life?\" Well, that's true of every day except one. (a beat) The day you die. \nWe're almost on top of the Burnham house now, as Lester, wearing sweatpants and running shoes, bursts out of the front door and dashes up the driveway. \nEXT. ROBIN HOOD TRAIL - A SHORT TIME LATER \nWe're now at street level, as Lester runs toward us. He carries a WALKMAN and wears EARPHONES, and we HEAR ROCK MUSIC as he runs. The endorphins have kicked in, and Lester grins, reveling in the sheer physical pleasure of his body. \nINT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - A SHORT TIME LATER \nThe blender GRINDS as Lester, still in his sweatpants, makes himself a high-protein shake. He's in excellent shape; even his posture has changed, and he moves with the confident, easy swagger of an athlete. Jane watches him blankly from the kitchen table. \nCarolyn enters. Lester leans against the counter, drinking his shake directly from the blender pitcher, eyeing her. He's got a newfound sexual energy that makes her uncomfortable, and he knows it. Carolyn quickly rinses off her coffee cup, avoiding his eyes, and starts out. \nCAROLYN Jane, hurry up. I've got a very important appointment-- \nJANE Mom, is it okay if Angela sleeps over tonight? \nJane looks at Lester to see how he reacts. He doesn't. \nCAROLYN Well, of course, she's always welcome. (on her way out) You know, I thought maybe you two had a fight. I haven't seen her around here in a while. \nAnd she's gone. Jane continues staring at her father. Finally, he glances over at her. \nLESTER What? \nJANE (nervous) I've been too embarrassed to bring her over. Because of you, and the way that you behave. \nLESTER What are you talking about? I've barely even spoken to her. \nJANE (angry) Dad! You stare at her all the time, like you're drunk! It's disgusting! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLESTER (angry himself) You better watch yourself, Janie, or you're going to turn into a real bitch, just like your mother. \nJane is stunned. She quickly rises, trying to get out of the kitchen before she starts crying. \nANGLE on Lester, and the immediate regret in his eyes. \nLESTER (CONT'D) (under his breath) Fuck. \nINT. FITTS HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nWe're outside Ricky's room, MOVING slowly toward the open door, through which we can see Ricky, standing at his bureau mirror, combing his hair. The scars on his face are almost gone now. \nA REVERSE ANGLE reveals the Colonel standing outside the door looking in, watching Ricky with great tenderness. Then Ricky looks up at him, and the Colonel is suddenly self-conscious. \nCOLONEL (brusque) You ready to go? \nRICKY Oh, I don't need a ride. I'm going to go in with Jane and her mom. \nEXT. FITTS HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - MOMENTS LATER \nRicky emerges from the house, followed by the Colonel, who watches his son as he heads toward the Burnham house. \nHis POV: Carolyn waves from the Mercedes, flashing an insincere smile. Jane leans forward from the passenger seat and glares at us. As Ricky starts to get in the car, Lester emerges from the house in his sweatpants. \nLESTER Yo, Ricky. How's it going? \nRICKY Pretty decent, Mr. Burnham. \nRicky pulls his door shut, but not before Lester mouths \"call me\" and Ricky gives a slight nod in acknowledgment. \n", "test3_input": "Lester puts a jar of mayonnaise back in the refrigerator. \nLESTER Do you want me to make you another one? \nANGELA No, no, no. I'm fine. \nHe turns to her and cocks an eyebrow. \nLESTER (concerned) You sure? \nANGELA I mean, I'm still a little weirded out, but... (sincerely) ...I feel better. Thanks. \nA long beat, as Lester studies her, then: \nLESTER How's Jane? \nANGELA What do you mean? \nLESTER I mean, how's her life? Is she happy? Is she miserable? I'd really like to know, and she'd die before she'd ever tell me about it. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nAngela shifts uncomfortably. \nANGELA She's... she's really happy. She thinks she's in love. \nAngela rolls her eyes at how silly this notion is. \nLESTER (quietly) Good for her. \nAn awkward beat. \nANGELA How are you? \nLESTER (smiles, taken aback) God, it's been a long time since anybody asked me that. (thinks about it) I'm great. \nThey just sit there, smiling at each other, then: \nANGELA (suddenly) I've gotta go to the bathroom. \nShe crosses off. Lester watches her go, then stands there wondering why he should suddenly feel so content. \nLESTER (laughs) I'm great. \nSomething at the edge of the counter catches his eye, and he reaches for... \nCLOSE on a framed PHOTOGRAPH as he picks it up: It's the photo we saw earlier of him, Carolyn and Jane, taken several years ago at an amusement park. It's startling how happy they look. \nLester crosses to the kitchen table, where he sits and studies the photo. He suddenly seems older, more mature... and then he smiles: the deep, satisfied smile of a man who just now understands the punch line of a joke he heard long ago... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nLESTER (CONT'D) Man oh man... (softly) Man oh man oh man... \nAfter a beat, the barrel of a GUN rises up behind his head, aimed at the base of his skull. \nANGLE ON an arrangement of fresh-cut ROSES   in a vase on the opposite counter, deep crimson against the   WHITE TILE WALL. Then a GUNSHOT suddenly rings out, ECHOING   unnaturally. Instantly, the tile is sprayed with BLOOD,   the same deep crimson as the roses. \nINT. BURNHAM HOUSE - FOYER - MOMENTS LATER \nRicky comes down the stairs, followed by Jane. \nINT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER \nRicky opens the door from the dining room, then stops. Jane appears behind him. \nJANE Oh God. \nTheir POV: A pool of blood is forming on the kitchen table. \nRicky comes into the kitchen and slowly approaches Lester's lifeless body, wide-eyed but not afraid. Jane follows him, in shock. Ricky kneels, gazing at Lester's unseen face... then he smiles, ever so slightly. \nHis POV: Lester looks back at us; his eyes are lifeless, but he's smiling the same slight smile. \nRICKY (an awed whisper) Wow. \nLESTER (V.O.) I had always heard your entire life flashes in front of your eyes the second before you die. \n", "test3_true": "We're FLYING across a white blanket of clouds. \nLESTER (V.O.) First of all, that one second isn't a second at all, it stretches on forever, like an ocean of time... \nEXT. WOODS - NIGHT \nIn BLACK & WHITE: Eleven-year-old Lester looks up, pointing excitedly at: \nHis POV: A DOT OF LIGHT falls across an unbelievably starry sky. \nLESTER (V.O.) For me, it was lying on my back at Boy Scout camp, watching falling stars... \nINT. BURNHAM HOUSE - JANE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nRicky and Jane lie curled up on Jane's bed, fully clothed. We HEAR a GUNSHOT from downstairs. They look at each other, alarmed. \nEXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DUSK \nIn BLACK & WHITE: Maple trees in autumn. Ghostly LEAVES FLUTTER slowly toward pavement. \nLESTER (V.O.) And yellow leaves, from the maple trees, that lined my street... \nINT. BURNHAM HOUSE - POWDER ROOM - NIGHT \nAngela stands in front of the mirror, fixing her make-up. We HEAR the GUNSHOT again. Angela turns, frightened. \nINT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY \nIn BLACK & WHITE: CLOSE on an ancient woman's papery HANDS as they button a cardigan sweater. \nLESTER (V.O.) Or my grandmother's hands, and the way her skin seemed like paper... \nEXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - NIGHT \nCarolyn walks slowly toward the RED DOOR, drenched to the bone, clutching her PURSE tightly. We HEAR the GUNSHOT again. \nEXT. SUBURB - DAY \nIn BLACK & WHITE: A 1970 PONTIAC FIREBIRD in the driveway of a suburban home. The SUN'S REFLECTION in the windshield FLASHES BRILLIANTLY. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLESTER (V.O.) And the first time I saw my cousin Tony's brand new Firebird... \nINT. FITTS HOUSE - THE COLONEL'S STUDY - NIGHT \nThe Colonel enters, wet. He's wearing LATEX GLOVES. BLOOD covers the front of his T-shirt. He paces in front of one of his GUN CASES; the GLASS DOOR is open, and a gun is conspicuously missing from inside. \nINT. BURNHAM HOUSE - HALL - NIGHT \nIn BLACK & WHITE: Jane opens her bedroom door, staring at us. \nLESTER (V.O.) And Janie... \nEXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DUSK \nIn BLACK & WHITE: A door opens to reveal 4-YEAR-OLD JANE, dressed for Halloween in a Princess costume, holding a lit SPARKLER aloft and smiling shyly at us. \nLESTER (V.O.) And Janie... \nINT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT \nCarolyn enters, terrified, still clutching her PURSE. She shuts the door and locks it, then takes the GLOCK 19 out of her purse. She opens the closet door and shoves the gun into a HAMPER. Then, suddenly aware of Lester's scent, she grabs as many of his clothes as she can and pulls them to her, burying her face in them. She sinks to her knees, pulling several items of clothing down with her, and she begins to cry. \nEXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - NIGHT \nIN BLACK & WHITE: \nA younger Carolyn sits across from us in one of those SPINNING-TEACUP RIDES, LAUGHING uncontrollably as she twists the wheel in front of her, making us SPIN even faster. \nLESTER (V.O.) (with love) And... Carolyn. \nEXT. PARKING LOT - DAY \nOn VIDEO: We're watching the video Ricky showed Jane earlier, of the empty white PLASTIC BAG being blown about. The wind carries it in a circle around us, sometimes whipping it about violently, or, without warning, sending it soaring skyward, then letting it float gracefully down to the ground... \nLESTER (V.O.) I guess I could be pretty pissed off about what happened to me... but it's hard to stay mad, when there's so much beauty in the world. Sometimes I feel like I'm seeing it all at once, and it's too much, my heart fills up like a balloon that's about to burst... \n"}

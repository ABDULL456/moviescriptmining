{"test1_input": "INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nOn VIDEO: JANE BURNHAM lays in bed, wearing a tank top. She's sixteen, with dark, intense eyes. \nJANE I need a father who's a role model, not some horny geek-boy who's gonna spray his shorts whenever I bring a girlfriend home from school. (snorts) What a lame-o. Somebody really should put him out of his misery. \nHer mind wanders for a beat. \nRICKY (O.C.) Want me to kill him for you? \nJane looks at us and sits up. \nJANE (deadpan) Yeah, would you? \nFADE TO BLACK. \nFADE IN: \nEXT. ROBIN HOOD TRAIL - EARLY MORNING \nWe're FLYING above suburban America, DESCENDING SLOWLY toward a tree-lined street. \nLESTER (V.O.) My name is Lester Burnham. This is my neighborhood. This is my street. This... is my life. I'm forty-two years old. In less than a year, I'll be dead. \nINT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nWe're looking down at a king-sized BED from OVERHEAD: \nLESTER BURNHAM lies sleeping amidst expensive bed linens, face down, wearing PAJAMAS. An irritating ALARM CLOCK RINGS. Lester gropes blindly to shut it off. \nLESTER (V.O.) Of course, I don't know that yet. He rolls over, looks up at us and sighs. He doesn't seem too thrilled at the prospect of a new day. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D) And in a way, I'm dead already. \nHe sits up and puts on his slippers. \nINT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BATH - MOMENTS LATER \nLester thrusts his face directly into a steaming hot shower. \nANGLE from outside the shower: Lester's naked body is silhouetted through the fogged-up glass door. It becomes apparent he is masturbating. \nLESTER (V.O.) (amused) Look at me, jerking off in the shower. (then) This will be the high point of my day. It's all downhill from here. \nEXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER \nCLOSE on a single, dewy AMERICAN BEAUTY ROSE. A gloved hand with CLIPPERS appears and SNIPS the flower off. \nCAROLYN BURNHAM tends her rose bushes in front of the Burnham house. A very well-put together woman of forty, she wears color-coordinated gardening togs and has lots of useful and expensive tools. \nLester watches her through a WINDOW on the first floor, peeping out through the drapes. \nLESTER (V.O.) That's my wife Carolyn. See the way the handle on those pruning shears matches her gardening clogs? That's not an accident. \nEXT. JIMS' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nIn the fenced front yard of the house next door, a dog BARKS repeatedly. A MAN in a conservative suit (JIM #1) chastises the barking dog. \nJIM #1 Hush, Bitsy. You hush. What is wrong? \nLESTER (V.O.) That's our next-door neighbor Jim. \nA second MAN in a conservative suit (JIM #2) comes out of the house. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D) And that's his lover, Jim. \nJIM #2 (re: barking dog) What in the world is wrong with her? She had a walk this morning. \nJIM #1 And a jerky treat. \nJIM #2 You spoil her. (sternly) Bitsy. No bark. Come inside. Now. \nEXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \n", "test1_true": "CAROLYN Good morning, Jim! \nJim #1 walks toward the fence to greet Carolyn. \nJIM #1 Morning, Carolyn. \nCAROLYN (overly friendly) I just love your tie! That color! \nJIM #1 I just love your roses. How do you get them to flourish like this? \nCAROLYN Well, I'll tell you. Egg shells and Miracle Grow. \nJim #1 and Carolyn continue to chat, unaware that Lester is watching them. \nLESTER (V.O.) Man. I get exhausted just watching her. \nLester's POV: We can't hear what Jim and Carolyn are saying, but she's overly animated, like a TV talk show host. \nLESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D) She wasn't always like this. She used to be happy. We used to be happy. \nINT. BURNHAM HOUSE - JANE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nJANE is seated at her desk, working at her computer. \nLESTER (V.O.) My daughter Jane. Only child. \nCLOSE on the COMPUTER MONITOR: A PERSONAL BANKING SOFTWARE window suddenly disappears to reveal another window: a PLASTIC SURGERY WEBSITE, featuring clinical \"before\" and \"after\" photos of surgically augmented breasts. \nLESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D) Janie's a pretty typical teenager. Angry, insecure, confused. I wish I could tell her that's all going to pass... \nOutside, a CAR HORN BLARES. Jane stuffs items into her BACKPACK. \nLESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D) But I don't want to lie to her. \nWe HEAR the CAR HORN again from outside. Jane studies herself in a mirror, then shifts to get a good profile of her breasts. \nEXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nCarolyn stands next to a platinum-colored MERCEDES-BENZ ML320, reaching in through the drivers' window to blow the HORN again. \nJane shuffles out of the house, her backpack slung over her shoulder. \nCAROLYN Jane. Honey. Are you trying to look unattractive? \nJANE Yes. \nCAROLYN Well, congratulations. You've succeeded admirably. \nJane gets in the car. Lester hurries out the front door, carrying a BRIEFCASE. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCAROLYN (CONT'D) Lester, could you make me a little later, please? Because I'm not quite late enough. \nLester's briefcase suddenly springs open and his papers spill all over the driveway. He drops to his knees to gather everything. \nJANE Nice going, Dad. \nLester smiles sheepishly, trying to lighten the moment. \nHis POV: Carolyn looks down at us, contemptuous but also bored, as if she gave up expecting anything more long ago. \nLESTER (V.O.) Both my wife and daughter think I'm this gigantic loser, and... they're right. \nINT. MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 - A SHORT TIME LATER \nCarolyn is driving; Jane stares out the window. Lester is asleep in the back seat. \nLESTER (V.O.) I have lost something. I'm not exactly sure what it is, but I know I didn't always feel this... sedated. But you know what? It's never too late to get it back. \nINT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY \nLester sits at his workstation, a BEIGE CUBICLE surrounded by IDENTICAL BEIGE CUBICLES. He's staring at a computer monitor and talking on a HEADSET PHONE. The beleaguered expression on his face is at odds with the light, friendly tone of his voice. \nLESTER Hello, this is Lester Burnham from Media Monthly magazine, I'm calling for Mr. Tamblin, please?... Well, we're all under a deadline here, uh, but you see, there is some basic information about the product launch that isn't even covered in your press release and I... Yeah. Can I ask you a question? Who is Tamblin? Does he exist? 'Cause he doesn't ever seem to come in... Yeah, okay, I'll leave my number... \n(CONTINUED) \n", "test1_id": 897, "test2_input": "CONTINUED: \nBRAD, a dapper man in his thirties, approaches and observes Lester, who is unaware of his presence. \nLESTER (CONT'D) It's 555 0199. Lester Burnham. Thank you! \nLester disconnects the call, obviously irritated. \nBRAD Hey Les. You got a minute? \nLester turns around, smiling perfunctorily \nLESTER For you, Brad? I've got five. \nINT. BRAD'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER \nBrad is seated behind his desk in his big corner office. \nBRAD I'm sure you can understand our need to cut corners around here. \nLester sits across from him, looking small and isolated. \nLESTER Oh, sure. Times are tight, and you gotta free up cash. Gotta spend money to make money. Right? \nBRAD Exactly. So... \nBrad stands, ready to usher Lester out. \nLESTER (blurts) Like the time when Mr. Flournoy used the company MasterCard to pay for that hooker, and then she used the card numbers and stayed at the St. Regis for, what was it, like, three months? \nBRAD (startled) That's unsubstantiated gossip. \nLESTER That's fifty thousand dollars. That's somebody's salary. That's somebody who's gonna get fired because Craig has to pay women to fuck him! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBRAD Jesus. Calm down. Nobody's getting fired yet. That's why we're having everyone write out a job description, mapping out in detail how they contribute. That way, management can assess who's valuable and-- \nLESTER Who's expendable. \nBRAD It's just business. \nLESTER (angry) I've been writing for this magazine for fourteen years, Brad. You've been here how long, a whole month? \nBRAD (frank) I'm one of the good guys, Les. I'm trying to level with you. This is your one chance to save your job. \nLester stares at him, powerless. \nEXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON \nA MOVING VAN is parked in front of the COLONIAL HOUSE next door to the Burnhams'. Movers carry furniture toward the house. \nThe Mercedes-Benz pulls into the Burnham driveway. Carolyn drives, Lester is in the passenger seat. \nCAROLYN --there is no decision, you just write the damn thing! \nLESTER You don't think it's weird and kinda fascist? \nCAROLYN Possibly. But you don't want to be unemployed. \nLESTER Oh, well, let's just all sell our souls and work for Satan, because it's more convenient that way. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCAROLYN Could you be just a little bit more dramatic, please, huh? \nAs they get out of the car, Carolyn scopes out the MOVERS next door. \nCAROLYN (CONT'D) So we've finally got new neighbors. You know, if the Lomans had let me represent them, instead of-- (heavy disdain) --\"The Real Estate King,\" that house would never have sat on the market for six months. \nShe heads into the house, followed by Lester. \nLESTER Well, they were still mad at you for cutting down their sycamore. \nCAROLYN Their sycamore? C'mon! A substantial portion of the root structure was on our property. You know that. How can you call it their sycamore? I wouldn't have the heart to just cut down something if it wasn't partially mine, which of course it was. \nINT. BURNHAM HOUSE - DINING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT \n", "test2_true": "Lester, Carolyn and Jane are eating dinner by CANDLELIGHT. RED ROSES are bunched in a vase at the center of the table. Nobody makes eye contact, or even seems aware of anybody else's presence, until... \nJANE Mom, do we always have to listen to this elevator music? \nCAROLYN (considers) No. No, we don't. As soon as you've prepared a nutritious yet savory meal that I'm about to eat, you can listen to whatever you like. \nA long beat. Lester suddenly turns to Jane. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLESTER So Janie, how was school? \nJANE (suspicious) It was okay. \nLESTER Just okay? \nJANE No, Dad. It was spec-tac-ular. \nA beat. \nLESTER Well, you want to know how things went at my job today? \nNow she looks at him as if he's lost his mind. \nLESTER (CONT'D) They've hired this efficiency expert, this really friendly guy named Brad, how perfect is that? And he's basically there to make it seem like they're justified in firing somebody, because they couldn't just come right out and say that, could they? No, no, that would be too... honest. And so they've asked us-- (off her look) --you couldn't possibly care any less, could you? \nCarolyn is watching this closely. \nJANE (uncomfortable) Well, what do you expect? You can't all of a sudden be my best friend, just because you had a bad day. \nShe gets up and heads toward the kitchen. \nJANE (CONT'D) I mean, hello. You've barely even spoken to me for months. \nShe's gone. Lester notices Carolyn looking at him critically. \nLESTER Oh, what, you're mother-of-the-year? You treat her like an employee. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nCAROLYN (taken aback) What?! \nLester is quiet, staring at his plate. \nCAROLYN (CONT'D) (more authority) What? \nLester gets up and starts after Jane, taking his plate with him. \nLESTER I'm going to get some ice cream. \nCarolyn watches him go, irritated. \nINT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nJane stands at the sink, rinsing off her plate. Lester enters. \nLESTER Honey, I'm sorry. I... \nJane turns and stares at him, waiting for him to finish. \nLESTER (CONT'D) I'm sorry I haven't been more available, I just... I'm... \nHe's looking to her for a little help here, but she's too uncomfortable with this sudden intimacy to give him any. \nLESTER (CONT'D) (finally) You know, you don't always have to wait for me to come to you... \nJANE Oh, great. So now it's my fault? \nLESTER I didn't say that. It's nobody's fault. Janie, what happened? You and I used to be pals. \nEXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nOn VIDEO: We're looking through GREENHOUSE WINDOWS at Lester and Jane in the kitchen We can't hear what they're saying, but it's obvious it's not going well. \n(CONTINUED) \n", "test2_id": 898, "test3_input": "The MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 is parked in the breakdown lane, its HAZARD LIGHTS BLINKING. Cars ZOOM past in the rain. \nINT. MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 - CONTINUOUS \nCarolyn sits behind the wheel, listening to a MOTIVATIONAL TAPE on the STEREO. \nTAPE VOICE --disinvesting problems of their power, and removing their ability to make us afraid. This is the secret to \"me- centered\" living. (MORE) (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: TAPE VOICE (CONT'D) Only by taking full responsibility for your problems--and their solutions--will you ever be able to break free from the constant cycle of victimhood. \nCarolyn leans over and open the glove compartment. She takes out her GLOCK 19. \nTAPE VOICE (CONT'D) Remember, you are only a victim if you choose to be a victim... \nINT. BURNHAM HOUSE - JANE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nAngela is sprawled across the bed. Jane stands across the room from her. \nJANE I don't think we could be friends anymore. \nANGELA You are way too uptight about sex. \nJANE Just don't fuck my dad, all right? Please? \nANGELA Why not? \nThere is a KNOCK on the door. Jane sits up, alarmed. \nJANE (angry) Dad! Leave us alone! \nRICKY (O.C.) It's me. \nJane jumps up and opens the door and lets him in. \nRICKY (CONT'D) (to Jane) If I had to leave tonight, would you come with me? \nJANE What? \nRICKY If I had to go to New York. To live. Tonight. Would you come with me? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJANE Yes. \nANGELA You guys can't be serious. (to Jane) You're just a kid. And he's like, a mental case. You'll end up living in a box on the street. \nJANE I'm no more a kid than you are! ( to Ricky) We can use my plastic surgery money. \nRICKY We won't have to. I have over forty thousand dollars. And I know people in the city who can help us get set up. \nANGELA What, other drug dealers? \nRICKY Yes. \nANGELA Jane, you'd be out of your mind to go with him. \nJANE Why do you even care? \nANGELA Because you're my friend! \nRICKY She's not your friend. She's somebody you use to feel better about yourself. \nANGELA Go fuck yourself, psycho! \nJANE You shut up, bitch! \nANGELA Jane! He is a freak! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nJANE Well, then so am I! And we'll always be freaks and we'll never be like other people. And you'll never be a freak because you're just too perfect. \nANGELA Oh, yeah? Well, at least I'm not ugly. \nRICKY Yes, you are. And you're boring. And you're totally ordinary.

Through the window, we see Lester, wearing only his sweatpants, performing bench presses. \nINT. BURNHAM HOUSE - GARAGE - CONTINUOUS \nThrough the window, we see the Colonel standing outside, watching. We ZOOM slowly in on him as he watches, transfixed. \nEXT.

Probably out fucking that dorky prince of real estate asshole. And you know what? I don't care. \nThe Colonel moves closer towards him. \nCOLONEL Your wife is with another man and you don't care? \nLESTER Nope, our marriage is just for show. A commercial, for how normal we are.

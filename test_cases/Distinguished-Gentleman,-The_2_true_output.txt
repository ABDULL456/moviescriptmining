TOMMY Wait here. He heads further into the office. 60   INT. TOMMY'S OFFICE - DAY                                   60 Equally unattractive.   Perched on the desk:   Reinhardt. TOMMY You again! REINHARDT Good morning, congressman. TOMMY What is this shithole? (CONTINUED) 
THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             37. 60   CONTINUED:                                                  60 REINHARDT Excuse me? TOMMY (gesturing, peeved) This. REINHARDT (casual) Oh -- you missed the freshman   lottery for offices. They assign them    by draw. You didn't show for the    draw, so you got the worst office in   Congress. TOMMY I missed what lottery? REINHARDT It was all in the briefing books I mailed you. TOMMY What else did I miss, Reinhardt? REINHARDT Are you hiring me, congressman? Tommy gives Reinhardt a good once-over, seeing him anew. TOMMY You're shaking me down, aren't you? Tommy laughs, then clasps Reinhardt's shoulders. TOMMY This is fantastic, Reinhardt. I haven't been here five minutes, and you're shaking me down. God, I'm gonna love this town. You're hired, man. Just tell me what to do next. I don't want to miss out on any of the good shit. REINHARDT The dinner for new Members is tonight, at Union Station. Do you have black tie? BEGIN elegant, spirited classical MUSIC. 61   INT. UNION STATION - MAIN HALL - NIGHT                      61 With its hundred-foot barrel-vaulted ceiling and grand windows, the magnificent Beaux-Arts station has been beautifully restored.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             38. 61   CONTINUED:                                                  61 A big crowd slowly makes its way along a red carpet to the party. Tommy was born to wear a  tux. In his  lapel, a red-and- gold eagle pin. On his   arm, Loretta, in a dramatic shoulderless and nearly  backless gown, with three-quarter gloves. The other Women   in sight are far more conserva- tively dressed. 62   INT. UNION STATION - ADIRONDACKS RESTAURANT - NIGHT         62 A STRING QUARTET provides the music. Tommy and Loretta linger uncertainly near the entrance. Then: TOMMY Let's meet some natives. Tommy leads her over to two Men, 30s, excellent haircuts. Both wear pins. He extends a hand. TOMMY Tommy Johnson, how'd you do, nice party, heck of a railroad station, isn't it? RAFE Rafe Simon, freshman from Tulsa. And this is Bo Chandler -- BO -- from Lufkin, Texas. You must be the one who didn't come to Harvard. TOMMY No, I couldn't, it was my Princeton reunion.... 
RAFE Jeff Johnson? You're Jeff Johnson? The guy from Florida? TOMMY That's right. RAFE (to Bo) The rest of us are out there on the campaign trail, raising money, kissing ass, making speeches, dragging our butts from place to place -- and he slides in on pure name recognition! (CONTINUED) 
THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            39. 62   CONTINUED:                                                 62 He puts his face close to Tommy. RAFE Let me tell you something, Jeff. A tense beat.   Then Rafe breaks into a smile. RAFE Fuckin' brilliant. Bo winks at Tommy. Tommy Thank you. Thank you both very much. (to Loretta) Isn't that nice, now, don't you think? (to Rafe and Bo) This is Miss Loretta, boys. She extends a regal hand to each, Liza Doolittle at the ball. LORETTA How do yo do.    How do you do. TOMMY And it's Tommy. My friends call me Tommy. "Jeff" is my... professional name. So what line of work were you boys in before you got elected? You lawyers or something? RAFE Oh, no, I did morning weather and traffic for KTOK in Tulsa. 
BO You don't remember me? I was a tight end for the Oilers -- my knee gimped out. The origins of the gentlemen's political success is not lost on Tommy. BO Hey, stop by my reception after the swearing in tomorrow, okay? RAFE Yeah, but don't you go to his reception before you go to my reception. (CONTINUED)

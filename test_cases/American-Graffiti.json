{"train": "\"AMERICAN GRAFFITI\" \nScreenplay by \nGeorge Lucas \nGloria Katz & Willard Huyck \nRADIO \nOn a dark screen an immense amber light appears and an electric humming begins. The eerie light glows brighter and illuminates a single huge number--11. We hear static and a large vertical band of red floats mysteriously across the screen. \nPulling back slowly, we watch the glowing band traverse back and forth over the amber light and past more numbers appearing-- 70... 90... 110... 130. And we begin to hear voices--strange songs, fading conversations and snatches of music drifting with static. \nPulling back further, we realize it is a car radio filling the screen and radio stations we're hearing, until the indicator stops. There's a pause...and suddenly we are hit by a blasting-out-of-the-past, Rocking and Rolling, turn-up- the-volume, pounding Intro to a Vintage 1962 Golden Week-End Radio Show--back when things were simpler and the music was better. \nAnd now a wolf howl shatters through time as the legendary Wolfman Jack hits the airwaves, his gravel voice shrieking and growling while the music pumps and grinds... \nWOLFMAN Awwrigght, baay-haay-baay! I got a oldie for ya--gonna knock ya right on de flowa--baay-haay-hee-baay! \nThe Wolfman howls like a soulful banshee as \"Rock Around the Clock\" blasts forth. \nMEL'S DRIVE-IN--DUSK \nA neon drive-in casts long shadows across a vast parking lot as the sun drops behind a distant hill. A large neon sign buzzes in the foreground... MEL'S DRIVE-IN, while in the background, \"Rock Around The Clock\" blares from the radio of a beautiful decked and channeled, white with red trim, tuck- and-rolled '58 Chevy Impala that glides into the drive-in. Main titles appear over action. Steve Bolander stops the elegant machine and gets out. He looks around, then walks to the front of the car and leans against the flame-covered hood. Steve is eighteen, good-looking in a conservative, button-down, short-sleeved shirt. Most likely to succeed, president of his graduating class. He looks around the empty drive-in, then hears a funny little horn. \nA Vespa scooter bumps into the lot. A young kid waves at him-- and suddenly grabs the handlebars again as the scooter nearly topples. Terry Fields (\"The Toad\") maneuvers the scooter next to Steve's Chevy but misjudges and ricochets off the trash can before stopping. Terry grins sheepishly. He's seventeen, short but plenty loud, both vocally and sartorically in his pink and black shirt, levis, and white bucks. He looks slightly ridiculous but always thinks he's projecting an air of supercool. \nSteve watches Terry smooth back his shiny ducktail and primp his waterfall to a perfect cascade over his forehead. He unbuttons his shirt one more button and lowers his pants to look tough. \nTerry walks over and leans against the flamed car, imitating Steve who pays him no mind. In the background, we hear the Wolfman howling with the music. The record ends and a barrage of humor begins from Wolfman Jack. The Wolfman is an unseen companion to all the kids. Witty and knowledgeable about the trivia that counts, he's their best friend, confidant, and guardian angel. \nNow, a grey, insect-like Citroen deux-chevaux putters into the parking lot and stops on the other side of the lot. Steve and Terry watch Curt Henderson get out. \nCurt stands by his little car. He's seventeen, a curly bespectacled, scraggly kid with a summer-grown moustache and a paperback stuck in his bermuda shorts. Curt thinks of himself as the town cynic. In reality, he's a hopeless romantic. He starts over to his buddies. \nTERRY Hey, whadaya say? Curt? Last night in town, you guys gonna have a little bash before you leave? \nSTEVE The Moose have been lookin' for you all day, man. \nSteve reaches into his pocket and hands Curt an envelope without saying anything. Curt opens it slowly and pulls out a check. \nCURT (sarcastic) Oh great... \nTERRY Whadaya got, whadaya got? Wow--two thousand dollars. Two thousand doll-- \nSteve looks at Curt suspiciously; Curt seems somehow guilty. \nSTEVE Mr. Jenning couldn't find you, so he gave it to me to give to you. He said he's sorry it's so late, but it's the first scholarship the Moose Lodge has given out. Oh yeah, he says they're all very proud of you. \nCurt hands the envelope back to Steve. \nCURT Well... ah... why don't you hold onto it for a while? \nSTEVE What's with you? It's yours! Take it! I don't want it. \nTERRY I'll take it. \nCURT Steve... Ah, I think we'd better have a talk. I've gotten- \nSuddenly a horn honks and they all turn. Laurie Henderson pulls into the drive-in and waves to them. She is driving the family's '58 Edsel. \nSTEVE Your sister calls. I'll talk to you later. \nCURT Now, Steve! Let her wait. \nSTEVE Okay, make it short and sweet. \nCURT Yeah, well... Listen... (clearing his throat) I... I don't think I'm going tomorrow. \nSTEVE What! Come on, what are you talking about? \nCURT I don't know. I was thinking I might wait for a year... go to city-- \nLaurie honks the horn a couple of times. Steve ignores her. There is a long moment and Curt looks uncomfortable. \nSTEVE You chicken fink. \nCURT Wait, let me explain-- \nSTEVE You can't back out now! After all we went through to get accepted. We're finally getting out of this turkey town and now you want to crawl back into your cell--look, I gotta talk to Laurie. (he hands the check back to Curt) Now take it. We're leaving in the morning. Okay? \nSuddenly, there's an ear-splitting roar and they all turn as a yellow '32 Ford deuce coupe--chopped, lowered and sporting a Hemi-V8--bumps into the lot. The low slung classic rumbles and parks at the rear of the drive in. \nLaurie takes his ring on the chain from around her neck and puts it in her purse. \nSTEVE Laurie, now, listen, I didn't ask for that back. I think that... \nLAURIE I know. I just sort of think it's juvenile now. I'll keep it at home. It's less conspicuous there. \nSTEVE You don't want to wear it? \nLAURIE I didn't say that. I understand and I'm not upset. I mean, I can't expect you to be a monk or something while you're away. \nSteve just looks at her and nods. The Wolfman howls an intro to \"Gee\" by the Crows. Outside, skooting around the drive-in after Budda, Terry is pleading with the sexy car hop as she delivers a tray to a car. \nTERRY ...and I have a really sharp record collection. I even have \"Pledging My Love\" by Johnny Ace. Anyway, how can you love Nelson when he's going out with Marilyn Gator. Since he dumped on you maybe we could-- \nBUDDA He didn't dump on me, you little dip. Hi, Steve! \nHer tone changes immediately. Terry looks sour and turns around to Steve who's getting out of the chevy. Budda leaves, wiggling her butt for Steve. \nTERRY She's a little conceited--just playing hard to get. \nSTEVE Listen, I came over here to talk to you about-- \nTERRY Any time, buddy. I'm your man. Nothing I like better than chewing the rug with a pal. You talk, I'll listen. I'm all ears. Shoot. \nSTEVE Shut up. \nTERRY Sure. \nSTEVE Terry, I'm going to let you take care of my car while we're away--at least until Christmas. I'm afraid if I leave it with my-- \nSteve notices Terry isn't with him any more and turns. Terry is standing frozen to a spot. \nSTEVE What's wrong? \nTerry tries to talk, much like a shell-shocked war veteran. His mouth moves but only a gurgle comes out. \nCurt is standing by the Chevy, talking with his sister Laurie. She's still upset by what Steve said to her. \nCURT Hey, sis--what's wrong? \nLAURIE Nothing. \nMeanwhile, they watch Terry as Steve explains to him about the car. \nSTEVE Now listen, only 30 weight Castrol- R. I've written the tire pressure and stuff on a pad in the glove compartment. Are you listening? \nThe others are watching now as Terry shakes his head mechanically. \nCURT What's wrong, he's crying! \nThere is indeed a tear rolling down Terry's cheek. \nTERRY I can't... believe... it. (He starts toward the car and gently caresses its paint.) I don't know what to say. I'll... love and protect this car until death do us part. (He circles the car.) This is a superfine machine. This may even be better than Daryl Starbird's superfleck moonbird. It is better than Daryl Starbird's. \nLaurie watches Terry, realizing that like the car, she'll be left behind as a fond memory. She turns and looks at Steve, who's been watching her. There's a moment between them... Budda comes by with an empty tray. Terry sees her and wipes his eyes. He walks up to her, a strange look on his face. \nTERRY Budda, how would you like to go to the drive-in movies with me? \nThe idea is so preposterous that even Budda is speechless. She looks around at others. \nBUDDA You've got to be kidding! \nTERRY Would I kid you about a thing like that? I want you to know that something has happened to me tonight that is going to change everything. I've got a new... \nJohn walks up quietly and casually pulls down hard on the back pockets of Terry's low riding levis. There is general hysteria as Terry quickly pulls up his pants. \nTERRY Car!! All right, who's the wise-- (He turns and sees John and changes his tune.) Oh, John--verrry funny. (He tries to laugh with the others.) \nJOHN Hey, did she do that to you? \nSTEVE Let's get going. It seems like we've spent most of our lives in this parking lot. \nTERRY Hey, Curt, let's bomb around, I wanna try out my new wheels! \nCURT I'd like to, Toad, but I'm going with Steve and Laurie to the hop. I'd just slow you down anyway. \nTERRY Yeah, tonight things are going to be different. \nJOHN Hey, wait a minute, you're goin' to the Hop? The Freshman Hop? \nCURT Yeah. \nJOHN Oh, come on, man. That place is for kids. You two just got your ass out of there. Don't go back now. \nJOHN Yeah, I know. \nPAZUDO Watch out for the cop that's in Jerry's Cherry. \nJOHN Yeah. All right, thanks. \nJohn nods and the two cars pull apart down the street. \nTRAVELING G STREET-STEVE'S WHITE '58 CHEVY \nThe Rock and Roll blares as Terry the Toad cruises along the main drag, singing along with the music. Sitting low in his seat, he looks around, his face aglow, experiencing a new world from the inside of a really fine car. This is the greatest thing that has happened to Terry in seventeen long years of being a short loser. \nTerry turns a corner and another car pulls alongside. A guy looks out the window. \nGUY Hey, Toad. \nTerry looks over and smiles coolly, proud of his new wheels. \nGUY (leaning out the window) Is that you in that beautiful car? (Terry nods modestly) Geez, what a waste of machinery. \nTerry's smile changes to a scowl as the car pulls away from him.. Terry accounts the slight to jealousy. Then he forgets it and enjoys driving the beautiful Chevy again. Another car pulls alongside of him as he cruises along slowly. \nGIRL Hey, kid. \nTerry looks over at the car cruising next to him. In the back seat, a guy has dropped his trousers and is pushing his bare buttocks against the side window--a classic BA complete with pressed ham. Terry looks away, wondering why this is still happening to him, even in his new car. \nTRAVELING G STREET-LAURIE'S '58 EDSEL \nCurt is in the back seat gazing out the window at the dark main street of the small farm community. Steve and Laurie are talking quietly in the front seat. Laurie is sitting near the window and it sounds like Steve is convincing her to move over. Laurie finally does. His arm goes around her and her head rests on his shoulder. \nCurt is laughing as the Wolfman harasses someone on the radio. The Wolfman is placing a call. \nWOLFMAN (V.O.) Here we go with another call out of the station. Can you dig it? Answer the phone, dummy. \nMAN (V.O.) Pinkie's Pizza \nWOLFMAN Ah, yeah, listen, you got any more of those secret agent spy-scopes? \nMAN Hit parade on the stethoscope? \nWOLFMAN No. No, the secret agent spy-scope, man. That pulls in the moon, the sky and the planets... and the satellites and the little bitty space men. \nMAN You must have the wrong number, partner. \nWOLFMAN 'Bye. \nWolfman cuts into \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love.\" Curt is laughing in the back of the car, as he listens to the ever- present D.J. \nSteve slows the Edsel to a stop at the next light. Curt glances over at a classic white '56 Thunderbird and sits up. In the T-bird, a girl watches him. Blonde, beautiful, her hair, backlit by a used car lot, seems to glow, making her look almost ethereal. Curt doesn't move, as if afraid of scaring her away. She smiles faintly---then says something, so softly it's lost... \nCURT What? \nCurt struggles to lower his window. She repeats it, but he can't hear. The light changes. She smiles once more and is gone. \nCURT (shouting) What? What?!!! \nSTEVE We didn't say anything. \nCURT Quick! Hang a right! \nSTEVE What? Why? \nCURT Cut over to G Street, I've just seen a vision! She was a goddess. You've got to catch her! \nSTEVE I didn't see anything. \nLAURIE We're not going to spend the night chasing girls for you. \nCURT I'm telling you, this was the most perfect, dazzling creature I've ever seen. \nSTEVE She's gone. Forget it. \nCURT She spoke to me. She spoke to me, right through the window. I think she said, \"I love you.\" \nCurt looks at his sister and Steve in the front seat. They are bored by his romantic visions. \nCURT That means nothing to you people? You have no romance, no soul? She-- someone wants me. Someone roaming the streets wants me! Will you turn the corner? \nLaurie looks around at him and seems to pity his flights of poetic fantasy. Curt sits back and shakes his head. \nPARKING LOT \nBig John sits in his deuce coupe, backed into the parking lot of the Acme Fall-out Shelter Co., the prime spot in town for girl watching. A guy in wrap-around dark glasses leans by the car next to John. They watch a group of laughing girls cruise by in a Studebaker. \nJohn grabs Carol by the neck and pushes her head down onto his lap so she can't be seen. John casually waves to the friend in the car cruising alongside. \nJOHN Hey, cool... \nCarol's head is being held down on his lap. She looks up at him. \nCAROL Hey, is this what they call copping a feel? \nJohn jumps, and immediately lets go of her as if burned. \nJOHN NO! Uh uh. N-O. Don't even say that. Jesus... \nJohn is beginning to sweat now. \nCAROL What's your name? \nJOHN Mud, if anybody sees you. \nCRUISING G STREET-STEVE'S '58 CHEVY \nTerry continues to cruise the main drag, slouched low and looking cool in his newly acquired machine. He adjusts his waterfall curl as the Wolfman dedicates a list of songs. He passes a group of guys bullshitting around the raised hood of a souped-up parked car. \nTerry cruises alongside two girls in a Ford. He revs the engine to get their attention and once he has it he motions to roll down their window. They flip him the bird instead and he lets them pass. \nTerry pulls up to a stop light. The car next to him is a '56 Ford--a good opponent and besides, the kid driving looks younger than Terry. \nTERRY What you got in there, kid? \nKID More than you can handle. \nTerry revs his engine. So does the Ford. The tension mounts. The green arrow for the left turn lane flashes on, the car on Terry's other side moves off, and before he can control his reflexes, Terry, too, has shot into the intersection while the light remains red! Terry quickly shifts and returns to the starting position. The other driver is grinning. \nTerry is flustered and embarrassed. Terry revs the Chevy a couple more times, concentration intently this time on the right light. \nGreen!... The Ford bolts into the intersection. Terry likewise floors the gas pedal and goes crashing backwards into a large Buick. Terry is stunned for a moment, then realizes he forgot to shift into first. He fumbles to get the car into first gear. \nA distinguished looking man comes up to his window after inspecting the damage. Terry tries to escape, but in his panic the engine dies. He struggles to start it. \nOLDER MAN Excuse me, but I think we've had an accident. \nTERRY Well, goddamnit, I won't report you this time, but next time just watch it, will ya? \nTerry roars off in a cloud of indignant smoke, leaving the gentleman standing in the street looking dismayed. The cars behind him begin to honk their horns and shout crudities. \nUSED CAR LOT \nTerry pulls up in front of a used car lot and jumps out to inspect the damage to Steve's Chevy. He rubs a small scratch on the back fender, but it won't disappear. As he spits on it, a slick, baggy-suited car salesman ambles up. \nSALESMAN I'll give you $525 for her on a practically new Corvette... and on top of this, I'm going to know 10% off the low price of this beautiful Vette. I'm talking about only $98 down and $98 a month. Now, how am I able to make you this incredible offer? I'll tell you! I'm forced to move all the sporty cars off the lot as quickly as I can. Boss's orders. He doesn't want 'em. I think it's a mistake, but what can I do? \nTerry begins to get worried as the salesman begins to fondle his new Chevy. He becomes frightened as the salesman attempts to drag him over to one of the 'Vettes. Finally Terry breaks away and jumps back into his car and the salesman continues to rave on as Terry drives away. \nHIGH SCHOOL GYM--\"AT THE HOP\" \nHerbie and the Heartbeats, wearing their matching red blazers, rock into a raunchy rendition of their masterpiece-- \nHERBIE AND THE HEARTBEATS One, two, three, four-- one, two three, four-- BAH... BAH... BAH... BAH... BAH... BAH... BAH... BAH... BAH... BAH... BAH... BAH... BAH... BAH... BAH... BAH... At the hop!! \nPulling back from the bandstand, we see the Dewey High School gym--the basketball nets swung back and draped with crepe, the lights half-low, the noise high, and the waxed floor being polished and pounded by stockinged feet as a seething mob of adolescents join in that ancient rite--The Hop. \nA hundred of them are dancing and swaying while the band gyrates on a raised platform. Kids on wooden bleachers watch the whirling and spinning mass of ponytails and ducktails, button-down shirts and mid calf skirts, cardigan sweaters with little belts in the back. \nTHE GIRLS' LAVATORY \nLaurie stands in front of a mirror in a line of other girls. She brushes her hair, staring rather despondently at herself in the mirror. The girl next to her is Peg Fuller, a cute cheerleader. \nPEG Hey, why are you so depressed? You'll forget him in a week. Listen, after you're elected senior queen you'll have so many boys after your bod-- \nLAURIE I don't want to go out with anybody else. \nPEG Laurie, I know it's a drag but you can't--remember what happened to Evelyn Chelnick? When Mike went to the Marines? She had a nervous breakdown and was acting so wacky she got run over by a bus. \nLAURIE I just wish I could go with him or something. \nPEG Laurie, jeez... Come on. \nBOY'S LAVATORY \nWe move down a row of sinks at which guys are working as intently on their coiffures as the girls. Ducktails being smoothed; glassy waterfalls being primped; the fronts of crew cuts being waxed to stand stiff. \nSteve stands looking at himself, then glances at Eddie Quentin standing next to him, dabbing something on his face. \nSTEVE What's that? \nMR. WOLFE Curtis, come here. Help me, will you? I'm surrounded. \nGIRL You won't dance? Come on. \nMR. WOLFE No, really, I'd like to, but I can't. I mean, if old Mr. Simpson came in here and saw me dancing with one of you sexy little--excuse me... one of you young ladies, he'd have my rear end. \nGIRLS Aahhh. \nThe all giggle. Mr. Wolfe shrugs at Curt and heads for a door. Curt follows him and they escape from the girls into the night. \nOUTSIDE THE GYM \nCurt and Mr. Wolfe come out of the gym. Mr. Wolfe sees a couple of guys skulking around in the shadows smoking cigarettes and laughing. The music has changed to \"See You in September.\" \nMR. WOLFE Hey, Warren. Come on, gentlemen, back inside. Put 'em out. Let's go. \nCURT (grinning as he pulls out a pack of cigarettes) Kids... Want one? \nMR. WOLFE (taking one from the pack) All right. Hey, I thought you'd left. \nCURT No, not yet. (looking for matches) I have no matches. \nMr. Wolfe takes out a pack of matches and lights both their cigarettes. They walk down a chain-link fence, past dark, venetian-blinded classrooms. \nMR. WOLFE Brother, how do I get stuck with dance supervision? Will you tell me that?... You going back East? Boy, I remember the day I went off. Got drunk as hell the night before. Just-- \nCURT Blotto. \nMR. WOLFE Blotto. Exactly. Barfed on the train all the next day. \nCURT (grinning) Cute. Very cute. Where'd you go again? \nMR. WOLFE Middlebury. Vermont. Got a scholarship. \nCURT And only stayed a semester. \nMR. WOLFE (smiling and nodding) One semester. And after all that, I came back here. \nCURT Why? \nMR. WOLFE (shrugging) Decided I wasn't the competitive type. I don't know... maybe I was scared. \nCURT Well, you know I might find I'm not the competitive type myself. \nMR. WOLFE What do you mean? \nCURT Well, I'm not really sure that I'm going. \nMR. WOLFE Hey, now--don't be stupid. Go. Experience life. Have some fun, Curtis. \nThen a voice calls from the shadows. \nJANE (O.S.) Bill? \nThey turn and see a girl coming out of a doorway. Mr. Wolfe looks at Jane, one of his students, but doesn't say anything. \nJANE I mean--Mr. Wolfe. Can I speak with you a minute. (She smiles at Curt.) Hi, Curt. \nCURT Jane... \nHe looks at Mr. Wolfe, who seems a little embarrassed. Then, Mr. Wolfe sticks out his hand. \nMR. WOLFE Anyway--good luck, Curtis. \nCurt shakes his hand. \nCURT Yeah... I'll see you. Thanks a lot. \nCurt walks back toward the gym. Looking around, he sees Mr. Wolfe standing in the shadows with the girl, talking intimately. Curt turns away and goes off. Before going back into the gym, Curt stops. He sees a white T-bird parked among a row of cars in the parking lot. He walks--then starts running toward the car. There's a blonde sitting in the front seat making out with some guy. \nCurt leans down to the window and is about to say something to his dream girl. But she turns and he sees it's not her. Her boyfriend glares at him like he's some kind of peeping Tom. Curt backs away awkwardly, trying to smile. He leaves. \nCRUISING MAIN STREET--'32 DEUCE COUPE \nThe yellow Ford coupe is gliding down the street--skimming around corners gracefully as the night lights glide up its lacquered hood.  Inside the car, Carol glances at John and smiles. The Wolfman is howling on the radio. \nWOLFMAN (V.O.) A Wolfman exclusive for ya now. The Beach Boys, baby, a brand new group. I predict they gonna go a long way. This is called \"Surfin' Safari.\" \nCarol is continuing to jabber on, relating past adventures with her little friends. John is unimpressed. \nCAROL So the next night we found out where they parked and went out with ammunition. \nJOHN Don't you have homework or something to do? \nJOHN Yes, sir. \nHOLSTEIN We know that was you tonight. We have an excellent description of this car. I could run you in right now and I could make it stick. But I'm not gonna do that, Milner, you know why? \nJohn shakes his head no. \nHOLSTEIN Because I want to catch you in the act. And when I do, I'm gonna nail you, but good. Happy Birthday, Milner. \nHolstein drops the ticket through the window onto John's lap. He starts back to his patrol car. When he's out of earshot John answers. \nJOHN Thank you--asshole. \nCAROL (looking over at him) You're a regular J.D. \nJOHN Here, file that under C.S. over there. \nCarol takes the ticket and opens the glove compartment. \nCAROL C.S.? What's that stand for? \nJOHN Chicken shit--that's what it is. \nCAROL Oh... \nShe looks amazed as she adds the new ticket to a mess of similar tickets crammed in the glove compartment. The police car pulls by them. John scowls, then roars his engine and pulls back into the stream of traffic. \nCRUISING MAIN STREET--STEVE'S '58 CHEVY \nTerry is looking and feeling like he's got it made. He downshifts and slows for a red light. A very mean-looking black '55 Chevy--blown, scooped and slicked--pulls up next to him. The driver, Bob Falfa, has a gum-chewing girlfriend sitting almost on top of him. Terry challenges the '55 Chevy by revving his engine. \nBob Falfa doesn't even look over. He revs his engine--which sounds like a cross between a Boeing 707 and a SuperChief. Terry can't believe it. He quits revving his engine--feeling deflated. \nTerry looks over at the snotty grin on Falfa's girlfriends' face. \nGIRLFRIEND Ain't he neat? \nTerry doesn't say anything and Bob Falfa glares over at him. \nFALFA Hey, you know a guy around here with a piss yellow deuce coupe--supposed to be hot stuff? \nTERRY You mean John Milner? \nFalfa nods slowly. \nTERRY Hey, nobody can beat him, man. He's got the fastest-- \nFALFA I ain't nobody, dork. Right? \nTERRY Right... \nFALFA Hey, you see this Milner, you tell him I'm lookin' for him, huh? Tell him I aim to blow his ass right off the road. \nGIRLFRIEND (giving another snotty smile) Ain't he neat? \nTerry doesn't say anything. There's another incredible scream as Falfa roars off, leaving Terry to stare through his smoke. Terry accelerates the '58 Chevy--at a prudent speed. \nAs the radio blares \"Almost Grown,\" Terry glides past the lighted stores slowly, taking in everything with wide eyes from his beautiful new car. \nTerry passes a steaming rear-end collision at an intersection where two guys and two girls are all yelling. \nThen, suddenly, he spots a girl--walking--alone. His mouth drops open in amazement as he slows to a crawl. Debbie, nineteen, with blonde hair, wearing a blue and white spaghetti- strap dress, strolls along the sidewalk. \nTerry rolls the powerful engine, but she ignores him. As he passes her, he speeds up. \nTERRY What a babe... what a bitchin' babe... And Wolfman Baby, she's all mine. \nTerry tears around the corner and starts his approach once more. He quickly whips out his comb, touches up his hair and settles down into a comfortable slouch. \nTERRY Okay, honey, here I come--James Dean lives! \nHe hits the clutch, roars the engine a couple more times and then--disaster. Debbie passes behind some rough looking dudes on motorcycles, parked along the curb. One especially vicious biker turns and looks at Terry as he passes. \nTerry roars off around the block. \nTERRY Stay cool, honey--don't let those creeps bug you. Wolfman, please don't let those creeps bug her... please. \nAs Debbie passes the bikers, they hoot, holler, and make barnyard noises. From the cat calls, and Debbie's manner it seems obvious that Debbie is a girl a lot of boys have \"known.\" \nShe has walked clear of the bikers as Terry screeches around the corner again. He pulls up alongside her and again slows to a crawl. The pass each other for awhile, but she doesn't look over. \nTERRY Hi! (lowering his voice) Hello... buenos noches? Need a lift? Nice night for a walk? Do you know John Milner? Curt Henderson? Sure you wouldn't like a ride somewhere? Did anyone ever tell you that you look just like Connie Stevens? \nThis stops her and she turns--Terry hits the brakes and the car bounces. \nHe takes her hand from the tucked-under-the-chin position and puts it around him, in a bear-hug. \nLAURIE You take me out? When we first met you didn't have enough sense to take the garbage out... I asked you out, remember? \nSTEVE What do you mean, you asked me out! \nLAURIE Backwards Day--remember? If I had waited for you to ask me--even after that you didn't call me for two weeks. \nSTEVE I was busy. \nLAURIE You were scared. Dave Oboler told me. Then when you did ask me out you didn't kiss me for three dates. \nSTEVE Well--I was-- \nLAURIE Scared--Jim Kaylor told me. I even asked my father why you hadn't kissed me. \nSTEVE Your father--great! \nLAURIE He said he thought you were bright and you'd probably think of kissing me after a while. \nHe moans. \nLAURIE You didn't, of course. I had to. Remember that picnic? \nSTEVE Out at the canyon? \nLAURIE Oh boy! You can't remember anything-- the first one, up at the lake. That was the first time you kissed me--I practically had to throw myself at you. \nSTEVE (quietly) I remember. \nThey continue to dance slowly. Laurie starts to cry, hating herself for it. Steve loosens a minute and looks at her. \nSTEVE What's wrong? \nLAURIE Go to hell. \nHe holds her tighter and they circle the floor, all alone, the crowd watching quietly, the gym echoing with \"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes.\" \nTHE GYM PARKING LOT \nCurt is leaning against a car in the parking lot. He's looking up at the stars and listening to the music floating out from the gym. \nWENDY What are you doin', stealing hub caps? \nA pretty, dark-haired girl, Wendy, slides up next to him and leans against the car. There's an awkward pause like that which happens often when two people who used to be close meet after things have changed. \nCURT Well--hey, Wendy. \nWENDY How've you been? \nCURT Fine. Great. How've you been? \nA horn honks and Wendy turns to a VW that's idling nearby. \nWENDY I'm coming--wait a sec. (turning back to Curt) She's got her car. Hey, I thought you were going away to school. \nCURT Ah, maybe... maybe. \nWENDY Same old Curt. All the time we were going together you never knew what you were doing... well, anyway, I gotta go. \nCURT Hey, Wendy--where are you going? \nWENDY Nowhere. \nCURT (smiling at her) Well, you mind if I come along? \nWENDY (affectionately) Okay. \nCURT Okay. \nThey go off toward the VW and climb in. \nBACK INSIDE THE GYM \nThe hop is almost over and the lights have been lowered, conservatively. Steve and Laurie hold each other, hardly moving and he kisses her. Still kissing, they continue to circle slowly--until a short, totally bald teacher comes and pokes Steve in the side. \nMR. KROOT All right, Bolander, break it up. You know the rules. You and your panting girlfriend want to do that you'll have to go someplace else. \nHe gives them a disgusted look and starts off. \nSTEVE Hey, Kroot! \nThe teacher turns, surprised by the omission of \"Mr.\" \nDEBBIE You know what I'd like more than anything in the world right now? \nTerry almost does a comic strip \"Gulp!\" \nDEBBIE I'd love a double Chubby Chuck. Isn't that what you'd like more than anything right now? \nTERRY (quietly) Sure... \nMEL'S DRIVE-IN \nThe endless chrome-flashing parade continues. Among the lines of fine cars, Terry is parked in the '58 Chevy next to an order speaker on a metal pole. Terry leans out the car window and orders into the intercom. \nTERRY A double Chubby Chuck, a Mexicali Chili Barb, two orders of French fries-- \nDEBBIE And cherry cokes. \nThe intercom clicks on and a garbled voice squawks back at him. \nINTERCOM Ark, wark, dork. \nTERRY (pushing the button) Now wait a minute. What? Huh? \nINTERCOM Ark, wark, dork. \nTERRY Yeah, right. Cool. \nAs they wait for their order, several guys in various passing cars yell sleazy greetings to Debbie. Suddenly, a rough- looking face, belonging to Vic Lozier, pops in her window. \nVIC Hey, Deb. How's my soft baby? \nDEBBIE Beat it, Vic. I'm not your baby. \nTerry nervously pretends not to hear. \nVIC Oh, come on, honey. So I never called you back. I've been, you know, busy... \nDEBBIE Three weeks... besides, it only took one night for me to realize that if brains were dynamite, you couldn't blow your nose. \nVIC Look who's talking. Who's the wimp you're hanging out with now? Einstein? \nDEBBIE Tiger happens to be very intelligent. Unlike you. I know every thing your dirty little mind is thinking... (She looks out the window, down at Vic's pants) ...it shows... \nTERRY Hey, now-- (his voice cracks) I mean, hey now, buddy, the lady obviously doesn't-- \nVIC Look, creep, you want a knuckle sandwich? \nTERRY Ah, no thanks, I'm waiting for a double Chubby--Chuck... \nVIC Then shut your smart ass mouth! I'll call ya, Deb, some night when I'm hard up. \nDEBBIE I won't be home. \nVic makes a kiss-off noise. She lights a match and flicks it at him. He finally leaves. \nTERRY You seem to, ah--know a lot of weird guys. \nDEBBIE That sex fiend is not a friend of mine; he's just horny. That's why I like you, you're different. \nTERRY I am? You really think I'm intelligent? \nShe moves very close to him and whispers in his ear. \nDEBBIE Yeah. And I'll bet you're smart enough to get us some brew. \nTERRY Brew? \nDEBBIE Yeah. \nTERRY Brew... oh--yeah... oh, sure... (she kisses him) Yes! Liquor! This place is too crowded anyway. \nTerry backs out and drives off, leaving the approaching car hop standing in an empty parking space. \nCAR HOP What about your double Chubby Chuck, mexicali-chili-barb and (looking at the tray) --two cherry cokes, sir? \nCRUISING MAIN STREET-'57 VOLKSWAGEN \nWe see the white T-bird ahead for just a moment, before it accelerates, passes a car and disappears, as we hear \"Peppermint Twist\" from the radio. \nIn the VW, Curt is in the back, shaking the driver's seat, yelling at Bobbie. Wendy is in front next to Bobbie. \nCURT There--don't you see it? Speed up, you're losing her-- \nBOBBIE Quit shouting in my ear! \nBOBBIE Do you know Kip? \nCURT Huh? Yeah, I know him. \nBOBBIE Talk to him when we go by. \nCURT What do you want me to say? \nBOBBIE Anything... I just want to meet him. \nThey pull up next to Kip's car and Curt leans forward and yells out Bobbie's window. \nCURT Kip, baby, what's up? \nKIP Henderson, long time no see. Whadaya been doing? \nCURT Not much, just wanted to let you know that Bobbie here is hopelessly in love with you and trembles at the sight of your rippling biceps... \nBobbie swerves the car away and turns a corner. She stops on a dime at the curb. \nBOBBIE You creep, fink, son-of-a-bitch-- \nShe turns and starts flailing at Curt with her purse. \nCURT Help, wait! Joke--Joke--Bobbie, remember your nose bleeds! \nBOBBIE Get out--get out of my car--I hate you! \nCURT Excuse me--ouch--Wendy--I got to go now. \nWendy is laughing and Curt climbs over her out of the small car. He gets out and closes the door. Wendy changes seats and looks at him seriously. \nWENDY Curt, I hope I see you at registration. Call me if you want. It was nice seeing you again. \nCURT See ya. \nThe car pulls off and Curt watches it. Suddenly, he sees something--the T-bird going the other way down the street. \nCURT Oh shit--there!! Wait! \nThe VW's gone and Curt starts after the T-bird on foot. He runs down the middle of the street, oblivious to the horns honking and the cars swerving to miss him. \nWe move with Curt as he moves like a broken field runner through the traffic only to finally lose the girl and the Thunderbird and to slow and finally stop, standing on the white line. Cars slow down and kids rubberneck as they go by him. \nCRUISING G STREET--'32 YELLOW DEUCE COUPE \nJohn is driving and the Wolfman is howling on the radio while Carol is having the time of her life. \nWOLFMAN (V.O.) Went to a dance lookin' for romance. Found Barbara Ann... baby... Hey, this one is for all you out there watchin' the Submarine Races. \nAnd the radio moans into \"Who Wrote the Book of Love.\" Carol sits with her feet up against the dash. John knocks them off and she scowls at him. \nCAROL I'm so thirsty, I could die. Just a little 10 cent coke to wet my whistle. It won't take a minute, I can drink it in the-- \nJohn suddenly hits the brakes and Carol almost hits the floor. John reaches over and opens the door. \nJOHN Why don't you just get out and get one then! So long, goodbye, hasta lumbago. \nShe stares at him, shaken, looking sweet and helpless. He turns and looks at her. A tear rolls down her cheek slowly. John can't take it. \nJOHN All right, one coke and then home. \nCarol is delighted. She slams the door. John takes off. \nCAROL Isn't it great, the way I can cry whenever I want. A lot of people can't do that, but Vicki showed me how. I bet you can't cry. \nJOHN Don't count on it. I may surprise you any minute now. \nMEL'S DRIVE-IN \nJohn cruises around the lot until he finds a space among the rows of dazzling cars. He pulls in and leans out to hit the intercom button. \nJOHN (into intercom) One ten cent coke. Is ice extra? All right, ice. \nCAROL Thanks for nothing. \nShe looks around, sitting up so maybe some of her friends will see her in John's neat car. \nCAROL Oh rats, I though some of my friends might be here. \nJOHN Probably a couple of weeks past their bedtime. \nCAROL Wait, there's Dee Dee. I hope she sees me. \nTERRY (gesturing through the window from outside) Hey, no. Not wine. Ssss--hey! \nThe owner turns and sees Terry waving. Terry ducks out of sight. When he looks back again, Terry sees the old bum is gone! Terry can't believe it. He finally enters the store. \nINSIDE THE LIQUOR STORE \nTerry tries to look very casual as he sidles up to the counter. Country-Western music hums over the liquor in hi- fi. \nTERRY (smiling at the owner) Hi there--ah, say--was there an old man in here a minute ago? \nOWNER Yeah. He went out the back. \nTerry is destroyed. \nOWNER You want something? \nTerry looks at the man and the endless rows of liquor behind him. \nTERRY Yeah--ah--let me have a Three Musketeers, ah, and a ball point pen ther, a comp, a pint of Old Harper, couple of flashlight batteries and some of this beef jerky. \nThe owner puts everything into a bag and starts to ring it up. \nOWNER Okay, got an I.D. for the liquor? \nTERRY A what? Oh, sure-- (feeling his pockets) Oh nuts, I left it--I left it in the car. \nOWNER Sorry, you'll have to get it before-- \nTERRY Well, I can't. I also ah, forgot the car. \nThe owner takes the liquor out of the bag and puts it back on the shelf. Terry stands there. The owner takes the money from him and gives him his change. \nOUTSIDE THE LIQUOR STORE \nTerry comes back to the Chevy with the bag full of junk. Debbie smiles at him excitedly and scoots over to the window. \nDEBBIE Hey, did ya get it? Ya get it, ya get it? \nHe hands her the bag. \nDEBBIE You got it. You got it! \nShe goes through the bag and finds a comb and the batteries. \nDEBBIE You didn't get it. Why didn't you get it? \nTERRY Ah, well, I needed some things and I thought as long as I was in there-- look, Debbie, can you loan me a dollar? \nDEBBIE What? Are you for real? Come on. Girls don't pay. Guys pay. \nTERRY Yeah, well, see--I've only got a fifty and he doesn't have change. \nDEBBIE Well, I can't believe this... I really cannot believe this. Here. \nShe takes the money from a squeeze-open plastic change purse and hands it to him. Terry smiles weakly and goes back to try his luck again at the liquor store. \nHe stops in front of the door as a young guy with numerous tattoos on his bulging arms approaches the liquor store. \nTERRY Hi--excuse me. I was wondering--could you, ah-- \nGUY Buy you a bottle of booze. Yeah, I know. You lost your I.D. What kind do you want? \nTERRY (amazed) Gee, that's terrific. Ah, just some ah--Old Harper. \nHe takes Terry's money and enters the store. The clerk hands the man a bottle of Old Harper. Terry waves excitedly to Debbie, lowering his pants a bit. Suddenly, there's a gunshot! Terry whirls to see the young man stuffing cash from the register into his pockets, backing away with a smoking gun. He rushes out of the store, tossing the bottle to Terry and running off into the night. Suddenly, the owner emerges from behind the counter, shooting wildly. Terry ducks and heads for the car with his pint of Old Harper. \nAUTO WRECKING YARD \nJohn's '32 deuce coupe crunches to a gravelly stop in front of a dark auto-wrecking yard. John and Carol get out and climb over the fence. They walk through a valley of twisted, rusting piles of squashed, mashed and crushed automobiles. John sticks his hand into his pockets moodily and stops and looks at one of the burnt-out cars. \nJOHN That's Freddy Benson's Vette... he got his head on with some drunk. Never had a chance. Damn good driver, too. What a waste when somebody gets it and it ain't even their fault. \nCAROL Needs a paint job, that's for sure. \nJohn doesn't hear her and walks on. \nJOHN That Vette over there. Walt Hawkins, a real ding-a-ling. Wrapped it around a fig tree out on Mesa Vista with five kids in it. Draggin' with five kids in the car, how dumb can you get? All the ding-a-lings get it sooner or later. Maybe that's why they invented cars. To get rid of the ding-a-lings. Tough when they take someone with them. \nCAROL You never had a wreck though--you told me. \nJOHN I come pretty close a couple of times. Almost rolled once. So far I've been quick enough to stay out of here. The quick and the dead. \nCAROL I bet you're the fastest. \nJOE It ain't the size that's in question here. It's the principle. Jeez, this is tough... what should we do with ya? \nANTS Tie him to the car and drag him. \nCurt turns and laughs at Ants' suggestion. He laughs and laughs until he realizes nobody else is; they are pondering the suggestion. \nCURT That's funny (clearing his throat) Hey, you guys know Toby Juarez? He's a Pharoah, isn't he? \nJOE Toby Juarez. Yeah, sure we know Toby. \nCURT He's a friend of mine. \nThey all grin and laugh with Curt who feels better. \nJOE Sure, good old Toby. He's a friend of yours. That's cool... we all hate his guts. \nCurt stops smiling again. \nCURT Oh--well, I don't know him that much anyway. \nJOE We killed him last night. \nANTS Tied him to a car and dragged him. \nCurt looks at them both, praying they're kidding. Joe looks at him, shaking his head. \nJOE This is going to take some thinking. You better come with us maybe. (putting his arm around Curt) Go riding with the Pharoahs... \nCURT Well, I don't think I can--I gotta-- \nJOE I know just how ya feel. \nJoe leads Curt gently but forcibly toward an incredible maroon '51 Merc that's been lowered and chopped so that the windows are like ominous slits and the whole machine has a submarine quality. Joe opens the door and Curt slides into the white fluffy interior. In the small back window, a metal plaque reads \"PHAROAHS.\" \nThe third member of the gang is Carlos, a short little kid about fifteen years old. He appears tougher than the rest with a cigarette dangling from his mouth. Joe heads for the driver's side and Ants and Carlos both go for the front passenger door. \nCARLOS Shotgun! \nANTS No, I called it! \nCARLOS When? \nANTS Before we picked you up. \nCARLOS You can't call it for the whole night, man. I got it now. Get in the back. \nCarlos gives Ants a hard look and Ants backs down and climbs in the back with Curt. The Pharoah's Mercury roars out from the curb. \nCRUISING MAIN STREET--PHAROAHS' '51 MERCURY \nThe radio blares \"Ain't that a Shame?\" as Curt sits in the back seat of the car looking very nervous. He eyes the three hoods cautiously. They are sitting super low, their eyes just visible over the windows. \nThen, Curt happens to look around. He does a double take. Through the narrow window he sees the Thunderbird passing in the opposite direction. Curt swivels and watches through the back window as the T-bird disappears around a corner. Then, he shakes his head. Of all the times to be trapped with the Pharoahs. \nOn the radio the Wolfman is giving a phone operator a bad time and the Pharoahs are chuckling. \nAs the Wolfman continues on the radio, the cars pass though the night like a metallic ballet. The Pharoahs' Mercury (with Curt aboard) passes Laurie's Edsel... \nInside the Edsel, Steve is driving. He puts his arm around Laurie and she leans her head on his shoulder. \nAs the Edsel cruises by in one direction, John Milner's '32 Ford coupe rumbles by on the other side of the street. \nINSIDE THE DEUCE COUPE \nCarol is laughing like mad as the Wolfman continues. Even John has to chuckle at the mad D.J.'s raspy patter. \nWOLFMAN (V.O.) Who is this on the Wolfman telephone? \nOPERATOR (V.O.) Hello, Collect... \nWOLFMAN Pardon me. Your name is Colette? \nOPERATOR Yes. Collect Call. \nWOLFMAN Your name is Colette Call? \nOPERATOR Sir, this is the Operator. \nWOLFMAN Are you French, Operator? \nOPERATOR This is a collect call for Wolfman Jack. \nWOLFMAN I... I love you, Operator. \nHANK We are all proud of you, Curt. The Moose Scholarship couldn't have gone to a better boy. And if there's anything we can do, let us know. \nMR. GORDON Yeah, you'll stay in touch by letter, won't you? \nThere's a knock at the screen and they turn to see Joe at the screen door. \nJOE Hey, we're all done out here. \nMR. GORDON All done? What--what's he mean? \nCURT Ah, he means, we're all done having loads of fun out here. \nMR. GORDON Oh, well... \nHANK Wonderful. You can have all the fun you want. This place is for fun. \nCURT Yes. Yes, it is. Thank you. Thank you both. \nMR. GORDON Good luck now. \nHANK Before I say goodbye, Curt, I want to tell you I hope you'll be taking along with you a little piece of this place. \nCURT I think I have. \nHANK Good. Don't forget us. \nCURT No, I won't forget you and you won't forget me. \nMR. GORDON Okay. 'Bye. \nHANK Good-bye and good luck. \nCURT 'Bye. \nJOE It was nice to meet yuh. \nCURT Right. What he said goes for me, too. \nCurt and Joe go out through the arcade toward the Mercury. They start walking faster, anxious to get away. Joe grins at Curt as they climb into the car. \nJOE Yeah, you just might make it as a Pharoah yet, boy. \nBack in the office, Hank and Mr. Gordon watch the car pull out. \nHANK Some day he'll make a fine Moose. \nTHE CANAL BANK \nSteve's Chevy sits near the canal. The door is open and the radio blares, while Terry and Debbie are off somewhere in the weeds making out. \nSuddenly, a beam from a flashlight plays across the trunk. Feet approach the car as the light beam moves across the interior and stops on the vacated shoes on the front seat. \nThe light beam continues past the empty bourbon bottle and starts int he direction of the field where Terry and Debbie are lost in the throes of passionate love. As we follow the light into the field we hear footsteps. \nAs the darkened figure approaches the couple, we see the light go out and catch a gleam of silver in the moonlight as a switchblade springs open! \nTerry reacts to the sound. \nDEBBIE What's wrong? \nTERRY I thought I heard something. \nShe kisses him and he forgets about the noise. The figure retreats back to the Chevy, where another indistinct figure waits. \nVOICE (O.S.) They're porking in the weeds. No sweat. \nTerry and Debbie are resting in the field, listening to the radio in the distance. A car engine is heard starting up and disappearing down the canal bank. \nThe countryside is very quiet. Only crickets and frogs are heard as Terry begins to drop off asleep. He suddenly jumps with a start. \nTERRY Wait a minute! \nDEBBIE What? \nTERRY The radio is gone... That means--the car is gone! \nHe scrambles to the spot where the Chevy once stood. \nTERRY Oh no!!! OH NO!!! \nDebbie comes up and watches Terry look heavenward. \nTERRY Oh God--I'm sorry. But, why the car? You could have struck us with lightning or something--anything--- but not the car! \nTERRY (whispering) No! I mean, no. Listen, I'll go for help, you stay here. \nTerry has turned and is starting off when she grabs him by his shirt-tail. \nDEBBIE Come on, we'll hide in the field. \nShe takes Terry's hand and they go off behind some bushes, away from the black water. \nDebbie looks through the bushes, squinting. \nDEBBIE Maybe if it's the Goat Killer he'll get somebody and we'll see the whole thing. \nTerry stands with his eyes closed. \nTERRY I don't want to see the whole thing. Especially if it's us he--oh, why me? I'm going to look lousy with your legs and a goat's head and-- \nDEBBIE Shhh--he's stopped. I can't see him very--I think he's coming this way. \nShe edges off to get a better view. \nTERRY Well, as long as he's not--Debbie! Debbie! \nShe's gone. Terry starts off, taking one step, turns, takes another, turns, takes another. Suddenly Terry hears something behind him. He turns very slowly and looks... \nA figure is standing right behind him, silhouetted by the moon, its face obscured. Terry jumps about three feet and yells. \nSTEVE (O.S.) Terry! \nTERRY Who, me? Why me? \nTerry stops yelling, seeing that it's Steve. \nSTEVE Terry. \nTERRY Steve! \nDebbie comes back through the bushes and Terry looks at her nervously. \nTERRY Where'd you go, anyway? \nDEBBIE Over there. \nTERRY Well, don't go off again. Come on, let's get out of here. \nTerry and Debbie start to walk with Steve back toward town. Terry keeps taking pulls from the bottle of bourbon. \nSTEVE What're you doing out here? Hey, where's my rod? \nTERRY (choking) Um, oh, did I introduce you? This is Debbie. Debbie, this is Steve. \nDEBBIE Hello. \nSTEVE Hi. \nDEBBIE Hi. \nThey continue to walk along the dark canal bank. \nSTEVE Well, what about my car? \nTERRY Um... I'ts in the garage. I put it in the garage for safe keeping. I mean... I don't want to take any chances with it. \nSTEVE Oh, great. \nDEBBIE Yeah. Yeah. It's a good thing too. 'Cause somebody stole our car. \nSTEVE Really? That's terrible. What kind was it? \nTERRY Gee, ah, where's Laurie, anyway? \nSTEVE I guess we broke up. \nTERRY You broke up? Bull! \nSteve just shrugs. The three of them go off into the darkness. \nCRUISING MAIN STREET-'32 YELLOW DEUCE COUPE \nThe coupe makes an eccentric swerve as it cruises along the main drag. Inside, Carol is looking at the gear-shift knob that she's taken off the shift arm as they listen to \"Do You Want to Dance?\" \nCAROL It doesn't look like a gear shift knob. \nJOHN Come on, will ya? Give it back to me. \nJOE Yeah, I seen her, what about it? \nCURT I was just wondering who she is. \nJOE She's outta your price range, man. My brother's been with her and he clued me in. \nCURT Price range? You mean she's a-- \nJOE Yeah, Thirty Dollar Sheri. Can you believe that? Thirty dollars. \nCURT We must be thinking of different blondes. \nCARLOS Hey man, don't tell Joe what he thinks. \nANTS Thirty dollars ain't much. I saw ten thousand once. My old man had it in a suitcase. They caught him the next morning though. \nCARLOS Fuzz ahead, watch it. \nJOE Where? \nCARLOS Fuzz ahead, watch it. \nJOE Where? \nCARLOS At Jerrie's Cherries. You can just barely see the fender. \nANTS That's rotten, man. Hiding like that. \nCARLOS That's shitty. \nJOE It's dishonest. \nAnts gives him the evil eye. Joe watches the cop car in the used car lot as they pass it. \nJOE We oughta do something. I got an idea. I got a good idea. \nMAIN STREET \nSteve, Terry and Debbie have made it back into town from the canal. They walk past the closed stores and stop on a busy corner. \nSTEVE I think I'm gonna go over to Burger City. \nTERRY Yeah. Yeah. Laurie's probably over there. \nSTEVE You really think she's got me worried about where she is, don't you? \nTERRY Well... \nSTEVE Let me tell you something. I couldn't care less. Want to come along? \nDEBBIE Yeah, I do. I do. \nTERRY No. \nSTEVE Make up your minds. \nTERRY No, thanks. U'mm. You know we got to report the car missing. \nSTEVE All right. See yuh. \nTERRY Yeah. See yuh. \nSteve goes off and Debbie looks at Terry. \nDEBBIE Why can't we go to Burger City? \nTERRY Burger City? Burger City!!? How can you think of hamburgers when somebody stole my car. \nShe looks hurt and starts off. \nALLEY BEHIND JERRY'S CHERRIES USED-CAR LOT \nCurt is getting out of the low-slung Merc and Joe saunters around from the driver's side. He smiles, friendly like-- \nJOE Listen, ah--Carl, I-- \nCURT Curt. \nJOE Curt. \nHe nods at Curt, looking cautiously around the dark lot. \nJOE Despite you scratching Gil's car, I like you. And I know what you'd like more than anything right now. Like every guy in town, you got the same secret dream, right? \nA DARK ROAD OUTSIDE TOWN--DEUCE COUPE \nJohn has glided off the main drag and into a residential area. Everything is dark and quiet as the adult population sleeps through the night. John pulls the coupe to the curb and turns off the engine. He turns out the lights. \nInside the car, there's silence. Only the clock ticking. Carol looks over at John a little nervously. \nCAROL Why are we stopping here? \nJohn looks at her and his arm slides along the back of the seat above her. She notices his arm and the fact that he's moving slowly toward her. \nJOHN (in a husky voice) Carol... \nCAROL What? \nJOHN I--I don't think that I can control myself any longer. \nCAROL You can't? \nJOHN No... Carol, I've got to have you. \nCAROL Me? \nHe touches her hair and she slouches back into her corner fearfully. \nJOHN All night you've been sitting there and you've been so sexy and it's been so hot--and I can't wait any more... \nCAROL Well--well, a lot of that's an act, you know. Like... like my crying. It was just an act. \nJOHN Well, it's been building up inside of me like a volcano, all night. Maybe if I knew where you lived I could fight it--I could take you home--but since you won't tell me, and since here we are--I've got to have you. It's too late-- \nCAROL It's not too late! It's never too late! 231 Ramona--two three one-- \nJOHN (smiling) Two three one-- \nCAROL I'll show you! It's easy to find. \nJohn starts the car engine. Carol looks very relieved. The yellow deuce coupe roars off down the dark street. \nMEL'S DRIVE-IN \nSteve sits in the almost empty cafe section of Burger City. He stirs a coffee and mulls over the night's events in his mind. A door opens and Budda Macrae comes in. She watches him a moment, then takes off her little Bell Boy Cap and gets a cup of coffee for herself. \nSteve looks up as she comes over on her roller skates. \nBUDDA Hi. You mind if I sit down? \nSTEVE Hi Budda. No, have a seat. \nBUDDA I got five minutes outa the rat race, and I saw you all alone. For a change. \nShe drinks her coffee and he looks out the window thinking about something else. \nBUDDA Where's Laurie? \nSTEVE I don't know. \nBUDDA I thought the two of you'd be going strong, this being your last night and everything-- \nSTEVE We broke up. \nBudda looks surprised. \nSTEVE No big deal. \nBUDDA Wow... what happened? \nSTEVE Nothing. We were out at the canal and... we had a fight. \nBudda smiles and he looks at her strangely. \nSTEVE What's so funny? \nBUDDA Nothing. Just thinking. A girl like Laurie--I mean, she goes to school and is cute and popular and all, but we're not so different. We know what we want. I've seen her after you for two years now. \nSTEVE She's not like that. \nBUDDA Maybe not. She does have a different approach. Hers is \"Never surrender,\" me I lay down my arms at the drop of a hat-- \nVOICE (O.S.) Budda, you got an hour left, let's get on it. \nBUDDA (yelling back) All right, relax... old fart. Listen, I'm off in an hour. If you wanta come over, my girlfriend's away for the weekend. \nSTEVE I don't know... \nDEBBIE Hit him! \nA good fighter, John lands a couple of blows to the gut and lands him on his can. Both of them crawl off. Terry is lying nearby, drunk, sick and bloodied. Debbie holds his head in her lap. John goes over and kneels by them. \nJOHN Hey, man, you all right? \nTERRY Yeah. I'll die soon and it'll all be over. \nDEBBIE (looking at John) Wow--you're just like the Lone Ranger. \nJOHN (eyeing Debbie) Yeah. Listen, are you with the Toad, or were you with them? \nTerry manages to raise his head. \nTERRY You're talking to the woman I love... \nHis head falls back again. \nJOHN What happened, man? \nTerry opens his mouth to start to explain, but it's too hard. He can only moan. \nMEL'S DRIVE-IN \nThe drive-in is emptying out finally as the midnight hour approaches and passes. The die-hards and the hard-ups are still wheeling through Mel's looking for remains of any action. \nSteve sits inside in a booth. Two gossipy looking girls come in smiling and slide into the booth across from him. \nSTEVE Hi, Karen, Judy. \nJUDY Hi, Steve. Have you seen Laurie lately? \nSteve shakes his head no. \nJUDY Well, we have. \nSTEVE (already annoyed) Oh yeah. So what? \nJUDY So nothing. She was just with a really cute guy in a boss car. We wondered who he was. \nSTEVE I wouldn't know. \nJUDY We do. His name's Bob Falfa. \nThe name registers with Steve. \nTerry and Debbie pull into the drive-in and park. Terry, his face swelling, groans as he leans toward the intercom. \nTERRY Help... I mean, I want two cherry cokes with lots of ice. Never mind, forget the cokes, just bring the ice, pronto. \nThe intercom repeats his order in a foreign language and suddenly Steve arrives and opens the door. \nSTEVE Out! OUT! \nTERRY What?? \nSTEVE I need the car--now. \nTerry gets out and Debbie gets out her side. Steve gets in. \nTERRY What's going on? \nSTEVE I'm about to find out. \nSteve roars out of the drive-in, leaving Terry and Debbie standing in an empty space. \nDEBBIE I don't believe it! You practically get killed trying to get your car back, then you let him have it. \nTerry looks at her, his eye swollen, his lip ballooning, his glasses broken. Finally, he gives up--it's not worth the trouble any longer. \nTERRY It's not my car. \nDEBBIE What? \nTERRY What? \nTERRY IT IS NOT MY CAR! \nDEBBIE Well, where is your car? \nTerry is upset now. \nTERRY I DON'T HAVE A CAR! \nBoth drivers start revvin' their engines; the tension builds. Terry looks nervous, the engines start to scream and Terry, his hands shaking on the flashlight, manages to flash it on. \nBoth cars roar off the starting line, tires smoking and screaming. Terry has his hands over his head and is coughing in a cloud of smoke as they pass. John beats Falfa off the line. \nOut on the road, as they hit third gear, the cars are almost neck and neck. Inside Falfa's car, Laurie looks scared to death. Falfa looks insane as he tromps it. \nJohn hits fourth at about eighty-five. Falfa does likewise-- but starts to fish-tail. Laurie closes her eyes, almost crying-- Falfa regains control nervously. \nFalfa's engine is winding out incredibly and he begins to get the edge on John. The cars rocket through the dawn light along the flashing white line until suddenly Falfa's car blows a tire, his front wheel slips off and the car shoots off into a tomato field, hits an irrigation ditch and begins flipping over wildly in a horrifying cloud of dust and smoke-- \nJohn sees the Chevy leaving the road and screams to a halt, swimming through an unbelievable U-turn and high tailing it back to the crash site. He is out of the car like a bullet, running across the dirty cloddy field. The crash car is beginning to burn in the engine compartment and John is panicked. \nMeanwhile, the spectators have arrived, including Steve, who jumps from his car and is running across the field. \nSteve and John arrive at the fire at approximately the same time. They stop, the flames are getting higher, burning up into the trees now. Steve looks around wildly--he sees John and goes at him. \nSTEVE You stupid sonofabitch, she was in that car! Why did you have-- \nHe takes a couple of swings at John, who finally manages to tackle him around the waist. They both get up looking at the flaming wreckage. Then John moves around the side, crouching, trying to see past the flames--suddenly, he stands and motions to Steve to come over. They both circle the wreck. \nAround behind the flaming car Falfa is standing in a state of shock watching the car go up in smoke, while Laurie is circling him, screaming and beating him with her purse. \nLAURIE I said I didn't--you lousy greasy jerk! You coulda killed me--what's wrong with you. You clubfoot... \nShe beats at him, crying hysterically. Steve runs over and grabs her, pulling her away. She fights at Steve, too, not knowing what's going on. \nLAURIE No, no, no. Please, don't come near me. No, please. I think I'm gonna be sick. Oh, Steven. \nSTEVE Laurie, please. \nStanding in the early light, Steve holds her. She throws her arms around him as the crowd develops along the irrigation ditch to watch the flaming car. \nLAURIE Oh, Steven! Oh, Steven, please, don't leave me. Don't leave me, Steven. \nSTEVE I won't. \nLAURIE I couldn't bear it. \nSTEVE I won't. \nLAURIE Please. \nSTEVE Believe me. \nJohn looks at Falfa who's shaking his head, watching the car dissolve. \nJOHN Come on, before she blows. \nHe pulls him off by the neck of the shirt and when they're a few yards off, Falfa's '55 Chevy does blow--exploding like a small A-bomb, blowing it into Modesto history. \nBack on the road, John is heading toward his car, its engine still running, its door open. Terry runs up, trotting alongside John like a puppy. \nTERRY Jeez, did you show him! He'll probably never even get in a car again. \nJOHN He was faster. \nTERRY It was beautiful, John. Just beauti-- what? \nJohn stops by the open door of the deuce coupe. Terry stares at him and squints against the rising sun. \nJOHN I was losin', man. \nTERRY What? \nJOHN He had me, man. He was pullin' away from me just before he crashed. \nTERRY You're crazy. \nJOHN You saw it. \nTERRY No, you creamed him, from right off the line. The guy never had a chance. \nJOHN Shit, Toad. The man had me. He was beating me. \nTERRY John, I don't know what you're talking about. It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. That guy, he might as well get a wheelchair and roll himself home. Man, you got... you got the bitchinist car in the Valley. You'll always be number one, John. You're the greatest. \nJohn nods, then looks up at Terry. His face is glowing, his glasses are smashed and his lip is swollen. John smiles. \nJOHN Look at your glasses, man. (shaking his head) Okay, Toad. We'll take 'em all. \nTERRY (grinning) Right. \nJOHN We'll take em... let's get out of here. \n", "test1_input": "CAROL All right, very funny. What a chop. Ha ha. Quit laughing!! \nJohn tries to control himself, but can't. \nCAROL Let's catch 'em at the light. Then you jump out and flatten their tires. \nJOHN Hey, wait a-- \nCAROL Just do what I say! \nJOHN Yezz, bozz.... \nMAIN STREET INTERSECTION \nCarol jumps out of the car as John stops the car in the right hand lane next to the Cadillac. As Chuck Berry wails \"Johnny B. Goode,\" they go into action. \nThe girls in the Cadillac recognize John as one of their victims and quickly roll up all windows and lock their doors. John starts pulling the stems from the front tires, sinking the car. Carol starts around the car with the shaving cream, spraying all their windows with the foamy lather. \nCarol is having a great time and John is laughing as they continue their guerrilla attack. They finish and jump back in the coupe. The light turns green and John takes off, leaving the Cadillac stranded at the intersection, covered with shaving cream. Traffic begins to back up... horns begin to honk. \nCANAL BANK--STEVE'S '58 CHEVY \nThe crickets chirp under the full moon. We hear \"I Only Have Eyes for You\" playing as the Chevy slowly comes to a stop in an isolated spot along the irrigation canal. \nTerry gets out of the car, pops the top off two cokes and pours half of them into the canal. He hums, refilling them with bourbon. He goes back to the car. \nTERRY Tootie fruiti all ruti... It's Super Cola! \nHe hands her one of the bottles and takes a long drink out of the other. He grabs the steering wheel for support and his eyes begin to water. \nTERRY It's a... a little... strong, I think. \nDEBBIE (drinking) It's the living end. \nTerry takes a smaller sip this time... \nTERRY Yeaah, I guess it wasn't mixed. \nDEBBIE Wow, it's pretty tonight. It's a perfect night to go horseback riding-- I was going with a guy once who had a horse. \nTerry chokes. \nTERRY Oh yeah? I used to have a couple of horses myself. \nDEBBIE Really? \nTERRY I used them for hunting. I do a lot of hunting. Deer mostly, although I got a couple of bear last year. Yep, they were good ponies--hunting ponies. I had to train 'em special, you know. \nDEBBIE Do you still have 'em? We could go for a ride. \nTERRY No, I had to sell 'em. To get these wheels... and a jeep. I also have a jeep pick-up, with four-wheel drive. It's got a gun rack. And I use that for hunting mostly. \nDEBBIE Why do you kill little animals? I think that's terrible. \nTERRY Oh, well, yeah, I figure with bears, though, it's either me or them... You know, I think you're really neat. \nHe suddenly grabs at her, putting his arms around her. She's caught off-guard and tries to move away. \nDEBBIE Wait a second. \nTerry immediately lets go of her. \nTERRY Oh, jeez, I'm sorry. I don't know what got into me--I didn't mean to-- maybe it's the booze or something. \nShe puts her coke on the floor. She unfastens the chain holding her sweater together and takes it off. \nDEBBIE There--now. \nSuddenly, she grabs him and pulls him down on top of herself. She kisses him madly. At first he's surprised, but then gets the hang of it. They begin to neck passionately, encountering many obstacles in the cramped front seat. \nDEBBIE Ow--you pinched me. \nTERRY I'm sorry. \nDEBBIE Let me get my head over here--okay, now you get up-- \nTERRY Ow--my leg, my leg. Ow, watch it! \nDEBBIE Ummm, I just love tuck 'n roll upholstery. \nAs they roll around, a couple of guys walk by the car laughing. Terry manages to sit up and watches them go off into the night. \nTERRY Geez, it's like Grand Central Station around here. Why don't we go someplace else. \n", "test1_true": "DEBBIE Nah, come on. They won't come back. \nTERRY Wait a minute. I got a blanket in the back. Why don't we go over into the field? \nDEBBIE All right. Okay. \nThey both get out of the car. Terry gets the blanket out of the trunk. They walk along a path next to the moonlit canal. Debbie carries their drinks for them. They left the radio on and Wolfman's voice can be heard as he takes another call. \nWOLFMAN (V.O.) Hello. \nGIRL (V.O.) Yeah! \nWOLFMAN How old are you? \nGIRL I'm thirteen, how old are you? \nWOLFMAN I'm only fourteen. \nGIRL Oh, boy, I love you, Wolfman. \nSINGERS (singing over) \"Wolfman Jack.\" \nWOLFMAN Oh, now we gonna do the weather for all the valleys and the mountain tops. Gonna be hot... about 200 degrees in Merced, 400 degrees out in Fresno, and I know we're gonna have about 500 degrees up around the valley somewhere. You got the Wolfman Jack Show. \nMINIATURE GOLF COURSE AND ARCADE \nAs the Silhouettes yip-yip-yip-yip into \"Get a Job,\" we see the mysterious white Thunderbirds cruise by and disappear. The Pharoahs' Mercury turns into the parking lot of a a miniature golf course. The doors open and the Pharoahs exit. There's a pause, then Ants reaches into the car and pulls Curt out also. The Pharoahs saunter into the miniature golf compound. \nCURT Hey, terrific, I love miniature golf. \nJOE I hate it. \nCURT Well, I don't play that often really. Ah--what're we doing here then? \nJOE We're outta gas. \nCURT They don't sell gas here. \nJOE No... but we're outta money, too. Come on, Carl. \nCURT Curt. \nJoe gives Curt a gentle push and they go inside. The golf course is empty, except for a couple of ugly girls putting around in the far corner. Under a trellis, Curt and Joe enter as the Pharoahs fool around with the candy machine, pinball games, \"Check Your Weight,\" and \"Air Corps Gunner\" games, pretending to play with them.  Joe looks around, whistling again. \nJOE All right, men. \nQuickly the Pharoahs go into action, jimmying locks, pounding coin returns, pulling out plugs, prying open change boxes and stuffing looses coins into their pockets. \nJoe smiles at Curt, who looks sick again, involved now in a robbery. Ants is sitting in a \"Rocket to the Moon\" ride, pounding on it unsuccessfully when suddenly it starts. Ants starts bouncing up and down looking dumber than usual. He swears at Rocket to the Moon under his breath--suddenly a screen door slams. The Pharoahs turn. A man in an undershirt stands by the \"Get Your Balls Here\" booth, regarding them warily. \nMR. GORDON What're you punks doing? \nThe Pharoahs can't think of anything right away. Ants bounces noisily in the \"Rocket to the Moon.\" The Pharoahs are all looking to Joe for guidance. Joe for his part is mumbling. \nCURT Hey, hi. Mr. Gordon, what's up? \nThe man looks at Curt, surprised. \nMR. GORDON Henderson--Curt Henderson? You with these punks? \nThe Pharoahs don't know what's happening yet. Curt walks over to Mr. Gordon. \nCURT These are my friends. We were just... \nMr. Gordon looks skeptical, then Curt smiles at him. Then Mr. Gordon smiles. \nMR. GORDON Jeez, you guys had me scared. \nHe laughs nervously. The Pharoahs laugh. Everybody's happy. \nMR. GORDON Hey, you haven't left yet? \nCURT Oh ah--no--no, I'm not-- \nMr. Gordon looks puzzled. \nCURT I mean, I'm not leaving until tomorrow. \nMR. GORDON Tomorrow. Well, listen, Hank Anderson's inside. Come in and say goodbye. You know, Hank's the one that brought your name up on the floor of the Moose Hall. You got the check, didn't you? \nHe leads Curt toward the screen door. Curt looks around at the Pharoahs, who are slowly starting to work again pilfering the machines. Inside the small office, Curt shakes hands with Hank Anderson, who pats him on the shoulder. \n", "test2_input": "Falfa looks surprised. The light changes, and he follows her to the curb. Laurie takes a deep breath, and with a determined look, gets out and walks back to his car. She gets in and closes the door. They start off. He looks over and smiles. \nFALFA Hey Hey Hey, baby, what do you say? \nLAURIE Just don't say anything and we'll get along fine. \nFalfa is puzzled by the frigidity in the air. He glances at her then back at the road, wondering about this strange chick. \nRESIDENTIAL STREET--DEUCE COUPE \nThe coupe slows in front of a modest California ranch-style home. John stops the car and turns off the engine. He looks over at Carol, who seems lost in thought. \nJOHN This the first time you've been quiet all night. \nCAROL I had fun. Goodbye. \nShe sits for a moment, about to say something. \nCAROL Do you like me? \nJOHN Yeah. I like you. You're all right. \nCAROL But I mean, do you like me? \nJOHN I, ah... I like you. Okay? \nCAROL Couldn't I have something to remember you by? \nJohn gives in to her sweet gaze. He takes off the gearshift knob, gives it to her, and leans over and gives her a kiss. \nJOHN 'Bye, kid. \nCAROL Gee, thanks. It's just like a ring or something. \nJOHN Yeah. \nCAROL It's like we were going steady. Wait'll I tell Marcia. \nJOHN Wait a minute, now. \nCAROL Wait'll I tell everybody. \nJOHN Don't go overboard with this thing. \nCAROL Well, I'll see you around. \nShe jumps out of the car and runs up the walk to the house. He watches her stop at the screen door and turn. She gives him a little wave, then goes inside. \nJohn looks over at the empty seat next to him and seems a little sad. He starts the engine and drives off slowly. \nWOLFMAN (V.O.) I haven't cried so much. And the tears and everything, man... I leaned down towards the microphone and I almost shorted myself out. \nOUTSIDE MEL'S DRIVE-IN \nCurt has the font hood up on the beetle-like Citroen and is fooling with the recalcitrant engine. Steve is standing beside him. \nCURT Hold that up. \nSTEVE (taking the hood from him) I've been thinking--maybe you're right. Why should I leave home to find a new home. Why should I leave friends that I love to find new friends? \nCURT Wait a minute, wait a minute. I've heard this already. Aren't you the one who for eight weeks has been telling me you have to leave the nest sometime? \nSTEVE I realize that. I realize-- \nCURT No--no realizing. You've been telling me all summer that it's time to pull your head out of the sand and take a look at the big, beautiful world out there. Gimme this thing. \nSTEVE (letting him close the hood) I don't know--I-- \nCURT (banging the Citroen hood shut) I feel like a mid-wife. \nSTEVE I guess I was wrong. I may have been wrong. \nCURT Wrong nothing. You've been talking about getting out of this town for eight weeks. And now--goddamnit!-- you're just--you're just mentally playing with yourself. If you can just relax, we'll talk about it at the airport. \nCurt walks around the side of the car and opens the door. \nSTEVE Where are you going? It's awfully early in the morning. \nCURT I have a dental appointment. \nSTEVE Come on, Curt... \nCURT Just relax, wil ya? I'll see you at the airport. \n", "test2_true": "ALLEY BEHIND THE \"COME ON INN\" BAR \nA half dozen people are standing around in the parking lot behind the bar. Debbie is sitting on the hood of a car, swinging her legs and chewing gum. The people all seem to be watching something on the ground behind the car. Coughing is heard, then gagging, and the unmistakable sounds of someone being sick. \nAt the back door of the bar even the cooks are looking and pointing. We hear more coughing and vomiting. A guy slides up on the hood next to Debbie. \nGUY I never seen a guy lose so much. He mustn't have been used to drinking. \nDEBBIE Oh no, he really likes to drink. He told me. \nAn old man looks at his watch and then up at the stars. \nOLD MAN Gettin' late... I knew a man once who got this sick. Billy Webber. That was ten years ago. What do you think that was there, that he had for dinner? \nMore groaning and gaggin is heard. An old woman moves close to the old man and he puts an arm around her sentimentally. \nOLD WOMAN Staying on his hands and knees like that... (she grins) He looks like a dog, doesn't he? Looks like old Ginger. \nOLD MAN Sicker than a dog, that's for sure. \nThe people drift off, leaving Debbie sitting alone on the car. Now, Terry slowly emerges, pulling himself up the hood of the car. His face is white. He lies across the hood trying to catch his breath. \nTERRY Ohh rats, I feel like-- (he notices a car nearby and pushes himself up) Wait a second... hey! \nHe staggers across the lot toward Steve's Chevy! Debbie slides off the car and follows him. \nTERRY It's--oh my god--it looks like Steve's car. Look, right here under our-- it's my car. My car. We found it. Look! \nTerry staggers around and looks for the keys. He searches under the front seat and over the visor. \nMust've taken the keys with them. \nDEBBIE Maybe we oughta call the police. \nTERRY Never get here in time. I got a better idea. We'll just steal it back. See if you can find some wire around. We only need a foot to hot-wire it... okay? \nGAS STATION--DEUCE COUPE \nJohn pulls the coupe out of the garage and wheels up to the pumps of the gas station. An attendant nods, looking at the roaring engine. \nATTENDANT Took the header plugs off. Expectin' some action? \nJohn looks at him from inside the coupe and nods slowly. \nJOHN Yeah. Think so. There's some punk lookin' for me. \nATTENDANT Why the hell do they bother? You've been number one as long as I can remember. \nJOHN Yeah... it's been a long time, ain't it? I'll see ya. Thanks. \nJohn drives the car out of the station and screeches down the street. \nALLEY BEHIND THE \"COME ON INN\" BAR--STEVE'S '58 CHEVY \nTerry is fiddling around under the dashboard, trying to hot- wire the Chevy. As the wires connect, the radio comes to life and the Wolfman growls. \nWOLFMAN (V.O.) Who is this on the Wolfman telephone? \nThere's the sound of a phone ringing, then the unmistakable voice of the Big Bopper answering. \nBIG BOPPER (V.O.) Hellooo, baaaby-- \nJust then, Terry looks up and sees one large badass looking at him. Terry gets up slowly and sees another big guy standing nearby. The first badass reaches in and grabs Terry by the shirt. He pulls him from the car. Terry is smiling weakly. \nTERRY Ah, hi--this is my car. What I mean is, somebody stole my car--I mean I lost my car and I want to thank you two guys for-- \nThe first badass shoves Terry toward the other badass. \nTERRY --for returning--I mean finding it. I mean, listen now, listen guys-- I've been sick recently, and this kind of activity can really be hard on a guy. Now, easy will you? Easy! \nThey throw him back and forth and start to rough him up seriously. Debbie is running around helplessly while they pummel Terry. Then, she sees the yellow deuce coupe passing. \nJohn glances out his window and notices the fight behind the Come On Inn. He punches it and wheels into a fast U-turn. \nThe hoods have quit playing with Terry and are punching him. Terry's still on his feet, mostly because he's drunk and staggering away from a lot of the blows; also, Debbie is screaming and pelting the assailants with her purse. \nDEBBIE Stop it, stop it, stop it! Help! Police! You creeps! \nJohn jumps out of the coupe and runs into the parking lot. He grabs one of the punks and turns him--smashing him in the face. The punk lands on his ass. John starts circling the other. \nTERRY Go, John! \n", "test3_input": "MANAGER What do you want? \nThrough the window, Curt can be seen but no sound is heard. \nMANAGER Pull the red switch. \nCURT I'm looking for a girl. \nMANAGER Aren't we all. She ain't here. Come on back to the booth. \nCurt walks around through a few more glass doors and ends up in the booth with the manager. \nThe manager sits down and leans back, turning a fan to blow on his large chest. He's a large, friendly looking man; he wears a Hawaiian shirt. He sucks on a popsicle. Curt stands awkwardly. \nMANAGER Hey, have a popsicle. The ice box just broke down and they're meltin' all over the place. You want one? \nCURT No. Thanks. Listen, ah... \nMANAGER Have a popsicle. \nCURT Are you the Wolfman? \nMANAGER No, man. I'm not the Wolfman. \nThe manager leans forward and picks up a spool of tape. He holds it up as a magician would for audience inspection, then puts it on a machine. A record is about to end. As it does the manager punches some buttons and the record segues into a Wolfman howl and then the distinctive Wolfman voice takes over. The manager adjusts the monitor volume down and sucks his popsicle. \nWOLFMAN (V.O.) Who is this on the Wolfman's telephone? \nDIANE (V.O.) Diane. \nWOLFMAN How're you doin', Diane? \nDIANE All right. \nThe station manager smiles at Curt, who is watching the tape and blinking lights of the large console. \nMANAGER That's the Wolfman. \nCURT He's on tape. The man is on tape. \nWOLFMAN (V.O.) Do you love me? Say you love me, Diane. \nCURT Well, ah--where does he work? I mean, where is the Wolfman now? \nMANAGER The Wolfman is everywhere. \nCURT But I got to give him this note. \nMANAGER (taking it from Curt) Here, let me see the note. (he reads it) Hell, that's just a dedication. All I gotta do is relay it. And it'll be on the air tomorrow, or Tuesday at the latest. \nCURT No, no. See, this is very important. I may be leaving town tomorrow, and it's very important that I--damn it, that I reach this girl right now. \nMANAGER You don't know whether you're gonna leave town or not? \nCURT Well, I'm supposed to go to college back East tomorrow. And I don't know if I'm gonna go. \nMANAGER Wait a minute. Have a popsicle. \nCURT No, thank you. \nMANAGER Sit down a minute. \nCurt sits down, undecided about leaving and upset about not being able to get in touch with the lovely creature he saw earlier that night. \nMANAGER Listen, it's early in the morning. Now, I can't really talk for the Wolfman. But I think if he was here he'd tell you to get your ass in gear. Now, no offense to your home town here, but this place ain't exactly the hub of the universe, if you know what I mean. And well--I'll tell you this much--the Wolfman does come in here now and then, with tapes, to check up on me, you know, and when I hear the stories he got about the places he goes. Hell, here I sit while there's a big beautiful world out there, don't ya know. Wolfman comes in last time talking about some exotic jungle country, handing me cigars he says was rolled on the naked thighs of brown beauties. The Wolfman been everywhere and he seen everything. He got so many stories, so many memories. And here I sit sucking on popsicles. \nCurt looks at him a moment. \nCURT Why don't you leave? \nMANAGER Well, I'm no kid anymore. I been here a long time. And the Wolfman-- well, the Wolfman gave me my start and he's sorta become my life. I can't leave him now. Gotta be loyal to the Wolfman, you understand. \nCurt nods and stands. The manager swivels around and punches some buttons, putting on a commercial. \nHe turns back. \nMANAGER I tell you what. If I can possibly do it tonight, I'll try to relay this dedication and get it on the air for you later on. \nCURT That'd be great. Thanks. Really. \nHe shakes the manager's hand, then wipes it on his pants. \nMANAGER Sorry, sticky little mothers ain't they? Bye. \n", "test3_true": "Curt goes out the door. He starts back out through the maze of windows and electronic machines. Echoing throughout the rooms, the Wolfman's raucous voice follows Curt. The Wolfman howls and Curt turns. \nThrough the maze of glass, shifting like prisms, he sees the station manager sitting by the mike--howling! Then, he laughs and howls again, starting to sing a song called \"Bluebirds on My Dingaling,\" pounding out the rhythm on the console. \nCURT Wolfman... \nHe backs away, leaving the Wolfman, who's on his feet now, screaming out the end of the song, dancing by himself in the little glass room, from which his voice radiates out through the night and around the world... \nMEL'S DRIVE-IN \nJohn is working under the hood of the deuce coupe when Falfa's Chevy drives into the parking lot. The radio is now blasting \"Heart and Soul.\" Terry moves over toward John's car. John doesn't look up, although he is quite aware of Falfa's entrance. \nFalfa slows down in front of John's car and revs his engine again. John looks up--Laurie is in the car with Falfa. She looks determined not to seem as scared as she really is. \nTERRY Hey, John, let me go with you. Come on. \nJOHN Naw, man. I can't take you when I'm racin' somebody. \nTERRY Ah, come on. Just let me go. So I can watch. Or, I'll flag you, okay? \nJOHN All right. Go ahead. \nTerry starts to climb into the car. John looks over at Falfa in the rumbling Chevy. \nJOHN Paradise Road. \nFalfa grins and gooses the Chevy, peeling out of Mel's Drive- in. \nCRUISING MAIN STREET--FALFA'S '55 CHEVY \nFalfa looks over at Laurie, who is watching the road nervously. \nFALFA All right now, where's this Paradise Road? \nLAURIE You just follow this street straight out of town... Listen, if you're gonna race John Milner, you can let me out right when we get there. \nFALFA Why don't you shut up, baby? You ain't said one word all night long. What a weird broad. But you're gonna appreciate me soon. You're gonna be hangin' on for mercy, when I get this sucker rollin'. \nHe accelerates the Chevy, shifting up deftly. Laurie looks scared now. \nCRUISING 10TH STREET--STEVE'S '58 CHEVY \nSteve is cruising along the almost deserted streets looking for Laurie. A T-Roadster pulls up alongside and a guy shouts at Steve. \nDALE You heading out to Paradise Road? \nSTEVE Paradise Road, I'm not-- \nDALE Some guy named Falfa going up against Milner. \nSTEVE John's racing Falfa? \nDALE Yeah. Figured something was up, saw them going out of town real cautious and then-- \nBut Steve is gone. Dale looks surprised as the Chevy roars off toward Paradise Road. \nMEL'S DRIVE-IN--PRE-DAWN \nCurt pulls into the parking lot just as the neon sign goes out. The last cars are leaving as the drive-in shutters up for the night. Curt stops next to the lighted phone booth and sits in his car, listening to the Wolfman. \nWOLFMAN (V.O.) I got a dedication here that's for a friend of the Wolfman--a special friend of the Wolfman who's leaving town tomorrow and wants me to play the next song for a blonde young lady in a Thunderbird. A white T- Bird, you understand? Now my friend's named Curt and he wants to talk to you out there, baby. So you meet him at Burger City, or phone Diamond 3132. Now he's a friend of mine, you hear, and, little girl, you better call him, or the Wolfman gonna get you. \nThe Wolfman howls and Curt smiles, leaning his chin on his hand, looking around the dark drive-in, wondering about tomorrow. \nPARADISE ROAD--DAWN \nJohn's '32 yellow deuce coupe and Falfa's black '55 Chevy are waiting side by side on a long, straight country road, their front wheels resting on a weather-beaten starting line. The sky is getting lighter as the radio plays \"Green Onions.\" \nThere are about six to eight other cars parked off the road to watch the race. Everything is quiet now, only the crickets ignoring the solemnity of the scene, and still singing. Terry jumps out of John's car, John hands him the flashlight and he takes up a position in front of the two cars. \nJohn looks over at Falfa, who's arguing with Laurie. \nJOHN Hey--Laurie, what in the hell are you doing in there? Is she gonna ride with you? \nLAURIE Mind your own business, John. \nFALFA Yeah, she's with me. You worry about yourself, man. \nTERRY Everybody ready? \nJohn settles back in the driver's seat and positions his hand on the gear-shift, which we see is wrapped with rags because of the missing knob. \n"}

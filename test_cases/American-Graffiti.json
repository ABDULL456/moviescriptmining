{"test1_input": "JOE It ain't the size that's in question here. It's the principle. Jeez, this is tough... what should we do with ya? \nANTS Tie him to the car and drag him. \nCurt turns and laughs at Ants' suggestion. He laughs and laughs until he realizes nobody else is; they are pondering the suggestion. \nCURT That's funny (clearing his throat) Hey, you guys know Toby Juarez? He's a Pharoah, isn't he? \nJOE Toby Juarez. Yeah, sure we know Toby. \nCURT He's a friend of mine. \nThey all grin and laugh with Curt who feels better. \nJOE Sure, good old Toby. He's a friend of yours. That's cool... we all hate his guts. \nCurt stops smiling again. \nCURT Oh--well, I don't know him that much anyway. \nJOE We killed him last night. \nANTS Tied him to a car and dragged him. \nCurt looks at them both, praying they're kidding. Joe looks at him, shaking his head. \nJOE This is going to take some thinking. You better come with us maybe. (putting his arm around Curt) Go riding with the Pharoahs... \nCURT Well, I don't think I can--I gotta-- \nJOE I know just how ya feel. \nJoe leads Curt gently but forcibly toward an incredible maroon '51 Merc that's been lowered and chopped so that the windows are like ominous slits and the whole machine has a submarine quality. Joe opens the door and Curt slides into the white fluffy interior. In the small back window, a metal plaque reads \"PHAROAHS.\" \nThe third member of the gang is Carlos, a short little kid about fifteen years old. He appears tougher than the rest with a cigarette dangling from his mouth. Joe heads for the driver's side and Ants and Carlos both go for the front passenger door. \nCARLOS Shotgun! \nANTS No, I called it! \nCARLOS When? \nANTS Before we picked you up. \nCARLOS You can't call it for the whole night, man. I got it now. Get in the back. \nCarlos gives Ants a hard look and Ants backs down and climbs in the back with Curt. The Pharoah's Mercury roars out from the curb. \nCRUISING MAIN STREET--PHAROAHS' '51 MERCURY \nThe radio blares \"Ain't that a Shame?\" as Curt sits in the back seat of the car looking very nervous. He eyes the three hoods cautiously. They are sitting super low, their eyes just visible over the windows. \nThen, Curt happens to look around. He does a double take. Through the narrow window he sees the Thunderbird passing in the opposite direction. Curt swivels and watches through the back window as the T-bird disappears around a corner. Then, he shakes his head. Of all the times to be trapped with the Pharoahs. \nOn the radio the Wolfman is giving a phone operator a bad time and the Pharoahs are chuckling. \nAs the Wolfman continues on the radio, the cars pass though the night like a metallic ballet. The Pharoahs' Mercury (with Curt aboard) passes Laurie's Edsel... \nInside the Edsel, Steve is driving. He puts his arm around Laurie and she leans her head on his shoulder. \nAs the Edsel cruises by in one direction, John Milner's '32 Ford coupe rumbles by on the other side of the street. \nINSIDE THE DEUCE COUPE \nCarol is laughing like mad as the Wolfman continues. Even John has to chuckle at the mad D.J.'s raspy patter. \nWOLFMAN (V.O.) Who is this on the Wolfman telephone? \nOPERATOR (V.O.) Hello, Collect... \nWOLFMAN Pardon me. Your name is Colette? \nOPERATOR Yes. Collect Call. \nWOLFMAN Your name is Colette Call? \nOPERATOR Sir, this is the Operator. \nWOLFMAN Are you French, Operator? \nOPERATOR This is a collect call for Wolfman Jack. \nWOLFMAN I... I love you, Operator. \n", "test1_true": "WOLFMAN Is Floyd there? \nOPERATOR It's for a Wolfman... Jack... \nCarol looks over at John and shakes her head. \nCAROL I just love listening to the Wolfman. My Mom won't let me at home. Because he's a Negro, I think... anyway, he's terrific. Do you know that he just broadcasts from a plane that flies around in circles all the time? Do you think that's true? \nINSIDE STEVE'S '58 CHEVY \nTerry drives on through the wonderful night--a blonde sitting next to him, he's feeling very bitchin'. He and Debbie are also mesmerized by the Wolfman. \nWOLFMAN (V.O.) Floyd, I love you, Floyd. Is this you, Floyd? I cannot look on thee, love took my hand... and smiling did reply, who made the eyes but I. Floyd, reach out and touch my soul. \nINSIDE THE PHAROAHS' '51 MERCURY \nEven Curt has to laugh at the Wolfman--despite his situation. Little Carlos sits in the front seat and looks over at Joe who's driving. \nOPERATOR (V.O.) Your party's ready, sir. \nWOLFMAN You mean Floyd? Hello, is this Floyd? \nVOICE (V.O.) Hello, is this Matilda? \nWOLFMAN No, it ain't honey--bye! \nCARLOS You tell her, Wolfman. He's my man. When I graduate, I'm gonna be a Wolfman. Hey, you know he broadcasts out of Mexico someplace? \nJOE No, he don't. I seen the station right outside of town. \nCARLOS That's just a clearing station, man. So he can fool the cops. He blasts that thing all the way around the world. It's against the law, man. \nIn the back seat, Ants nods in agreement. \nANTS Ah, man--they'll never catch the Wolfman. \nThen Ants' nose starts twitching and he looks over at Curt suspiciously. \nANTS Hey, man, who cut the cheese? \nCurt tries to smile but looks pretty guilty. Then Joe looks around from the front seat. \nJOE He who smelt it, dealt it. (looking at Curt in the back) Hey, creep, scoot down. Sitting up like that, it wrecks the lines of the car, you know what I mean? \nCurt scoots down to a level even with Ants. Ants is staring at him and grinning evilly. Then they hear an incredible roar, and they all turn to see Bob Falfa's black '55 Chevy pass by. Falfa has a new girl with him this time, a lovely redhead. \nJOE There's that badass Chevy again. Look at he snatch he's got with him. \nANTS Hey, man, he looks like a whimp. \nCurt nods and tries to join in. \nCURT Probably is. Whimps get all the snatch. \nCarlos and Ants look at him. Like nobody asked him to open his mouth. \nCARLOS Milner ain't gonna beat that. His time has come. He's getting old. He ain't as fast as he used to be. \nINSIDE THE DEUCE COUPE \nMilner may not be as fast a he used to be--and having a little teeny-bopper with him isn't helping matters. He looks over at Carol. She's moved closer to him. \nJOHN You got two seconds to get your ass over in the corner. \nCAROL Don't worry, I won't rape you. \nCarol slides back to her side. But as they glide along, Carol watches John. She's moon-eyed and flipped over him. John deftly down-shifts as he approaches a light and then accelerates through the gears with a \"race\" expertise. \nThere's a honk and John and Carol look over to see a '60 Cadillac full of girls laughing at them. \nGIRL You got a bitchin' car. \nJohn nods modestly. \nGIRL In fact, we're gonna give you our special prize for having the neatest car around. You want me to give it to you? \nJOHN If the prize is you, honey, I'm a ready Teddy. \nGIRL Yeah, well get bent turkey. \nThe girl suddenly launches a water balloon, which John ducks deftly, the tumescent missile catching Carol full in the face. The girls roar off. John cracks up as Carol blinks away the water, not believing what's happened. She wipes her face. \n", "test1_id": 93, "test2_input": "CAROL All right, very funny. What a chop. Ha ha. Quit laughing!! \nJohn tries to control himself, but can't. \nCAROL Let's catch 'em at the light. Then you jump out and flatten their tires. \nJOHN Hey, wait a-- \nCAROL Just do what I say! \nJOHN Yezz, bozz.... \nMAIN STREET INTERSECTION \nCarol jumps out of the car as John stops the car in the right hand lane next to the Cadillac. As Chuck Berry wails \"Johnny B. Goode,\" they go into action. \nThe girls in the Cadillac recognize John as one of their victims and quickly roll up all windows and lock their doors. John starts pulling the stems from the front tires, sinking the car. Carol starts around the car with the shaving cream, spraying all their windows with the foamy lather. \nCarol is having a great time and John is laughing as they continue their guerrilla attack. They finish and jump back in the coupe. The light turns green and John takes off, leaving the Cadillac stranded at the intersection, covered with shaving cream. Traffic begins to back up... horns begin to honk. \nCANAL BANK--STEVE'S '58 CHEVY \nThe crickets chirp under the full moon. We hear \"I Only Have Eyes for You\" playing as the Chevy slowly comes to a stop in an isolated spot along the irrigation canal. \nTerry gets out of the car, pops the top off two cokes and pours half of them into the canal. He hums, refilling them with bourbon. He goes back to the car. \nTERRY Tootie fruiti all ruti... It's Super Cola! \nHe hands her one of the bottles and takes a long drink out of the other. He grabs the steering wheel for support and his eyes begin to water. \nTERRY It's a... a little... strong, I think. \nDEBBIE (drinking) It's the living end. \nTerry takes a smaller sip this time... \nTERRY Yeaah, I guess it wasn't mixed. \nDEBBIE Wow, it's pretty tonight. It's a perfect night to go horseback riding-- I was going with a guy once who had a horse. \nTerry chokes. \nTERRY Oh yeah? I used to have a couple of horses myself. \nDEBBIE Really? \nTERRY I used them for hunting. I do a lot of hunting. Deer mostly, although I got a couple of bear last year. Yep, they were good ponies--hunting ponies. I had to train 'em special, you know. \nDEBBIE Do you still have 'em? We could go for a ride. \nTERRY No, I had to sell 'em. To get these wheels... and a jeep. I also have a jeep pick-up, with four-wheel drive. It's got a gun rack. And I use that for hunting mostly. \nDEBBIE Why do you kill little animals? I think that's terrible. \nTERRY Oh, well, yeah, I figure with bears, though, it's either me or them... You know, I think you're really neat. \nHe suddenly grabs at her, putting his arms around her. She's caught off-guard and tries to move away. \nDEBBIE Wait a second. \nTerry immediately lets go of her. \nTERRY Oh, jeez, I'm sorry. I don't know what got into me--I didn't mean to-- maybe it's the booze or something. \nShe puts her coke on the floor. She unfastens the chain holding her sweater together and takes it off. \nDEBBIE There--now. \nSuddenly, she grabs him and pulls him down on top of herself. She kisses him madly. At first he's surprised, but then gets the hang of it. They begin to neck passionately, encountering many obstacles in the cramped front seat. \nDEBBIE Ow--you pinched me. \nTERRY I'm sorry. \nDEBBIE Let me get my head over here--okay, now you get up-- \nTERRY Ow--my leg, my leg. Ow, watch it! \nDEBBIE Ummm, I just love tuck 'n roll upholstery. \nAs they roll around, a couple of guys walk by the car laughing. Terry manages to sit up and watches them go off into the night. \nTERRY Geez, it's like Grand Central Station around here. Why don't we go someplace else. \n", "test2_true": "DEBBIE Nah, come on. They won't come back. \nTERRY Wait a minute. I got a blanket in the back. Why don't we go over into the field? \nDEBBIE All right. Okay. \nThey both get out of the car. Terry gets the blanket out of the trunk. They walk along a path next to the moonlit canal. Debbie carries their drinks for them. They left the radio on and Wolfman's voice can be heard as he takes another call. \nWOLFMAN (V.O.) Hello. \nGIRL (V.O.) Yeah! \nWOLFMAN How old are you? \nGIRL I'm thirteen, how old are you? \nWOLFMAN I'm only fourteen. \nGIRL Oh, boy, I love you, Wolfman. \nSINGERS (singing over) \"Wolfman Jack.\" \nWOLFMAN Oh, now we gonna do the weather for all the valleys and the mountain tops. Gonna be hot... about 200 degrees in Merced, 400 degrees out in Fresno, and I know we're gonna have about 500 degrees up around the valley somewhere. You got the Wolfman Jack Show. \nMINIATURE GOLF COURSE AND ARCADE \nAs the Silhouettes yip-yip-yip-yip into \"Get a Job,\" we see the mysterious white Thunderbirds cruise by and disappear. The Pharoahs' Mercury turns into the parking lot of a a miniature golf course. The doors open and the Pharoahs exit. There's a pause, then Ants reaches into the car and pulls Curt out also. The Pharoahs saunter into the miniature golf compound. \nCURT Hey, terrific, I love miniature golf. \nJOE I hate it. \nCURT Well, I don't play that often really. Ah--what're we doing here then? \nJOE We're outta gas. \nCURT They don't sell gas here. \nJOE No... but we're outta money, too. Come on, Carl. \nCURT Curt. \nJoe gives Curt a gentle push and they go inside. The golf course is empty, except for a couple of ugly girls putting around in the far corner. Under a trellis, Curt and Joe enter as the Pharoahs fool around with the candy machine, pinball games, \"Check Your Weight,\" and \"Air Corps Gunner\" games, pretending to play with them.  Joe looks around, whistling again. \nJOE All right, men. \nQuickly the Pharoahs go into action, jimmying locks, pounding coin returns, pulling out plugs, prying open change boxes and stuffing looses coins into their pockets. \nJoe smiles at Curt, who looks sick again, involved now in a robbery. Ants is sitting in a \"Rocket to the Moon\" ride, pounding on it unsuccessfully when suddenly it starts. Ants starts bouncing up and down looking dumber than usual. He swears at Rocket to the Moon under his breath--suddenly a screen door slams. The Pharoahs turn. A man in an undershirt stands by the \"Get Your Balls Here\" booth, regarding them warily. \nMR. GORDON What're you punks doing? \nThe Pharoahs can't think of anything right away. Ants bounces noisily in the \"Rocket to the Moon.\" The Pharoahs are all looking to Joe for guidance. Joe for his part is mumbling. \nCURT Hey, hi. Mr. Gordon, what's up? \nThe man looks at Curt, surprised. \nMR. GORDON Henderson--Curt Henderson? You with these punks? \nThe Pharoahs don't know what's happening yet. Curt walks over to Mr. Gordon. \nCURT These are my friends. We were just... \nMr. Gordon looks skeptical, then Curt smiles at him. Then Mr. Gordon smiles. \nMR. GORDON Jeez, you guys had me scared. \nHe laughs nervously. The Pharoahs laugh. Everybody's happy. \nMR. GORDON Hey, you haven't left yet? \nCURT Oh ah--no--no, I'm not-- \nMr. Gordon looks puzzled. \nCURT I mean, I'm not leaving until tomorrow. \nMR. GORDON Tomorrow. Well, listen, Hank Anderson's inside. Come in and say goodbye. You know, Hank's the one that brought your name up on the floor of the Moose Hall. You got the check, didn't you? \nHe leads Curt toward the screen door. Curt looks around at the Pharoahs, who are slowly starting to work again pilfering the machines. Inside the small office, Curt shakes hands with Hank Anderson, who pats him on the shoulder. \n", "test2_id": 94, "test3_input": "DEBBIE Hit him! \nA good fighter, John lands a couple of blows to the gut and lands him on his can. Both of them crawl off. Terry is lying nearby, drunk, sick and bloodied. Debbie holds his head in her lap. John goes over and kneels by them. \nJOHN Hey, man, you all right? \nTERRY Yeah. I'll die soon and it'll all be over. \nDEBBIE (looking at John) Wow--you're just like the Lone Ranger. \nJOHN (eyeing Debbie) Yeah. Listen, are you with the Toad, or were you with them? \nTerry manages to raise his head. \nTERRY You're talking to the woman I love... \nHis head falls back again. \nJOHN What happened, man? \nTerry opens his mouth to start to explain, but it's too hard. He can only moan. \nMEL'S DRIVE-IN \nThe drive-in is emptying out finally as the midnight hour approaches and passes. The die-hards and the hard-ups are still wheeling through Mel's looking for remains of any action. \nSteve sits inside in a booth. Two gossipy looking girls come in smiling and slide into the booth across from him. \nSTEVE Hi, Karen, Judy. \nJUDY Hi, Steve. Have you seen Laurie lately? \nSteve shakes his head no. \nJUDY Well, we have. \nSTEVE (already annoyed) Oh yeah. So what? \nJUDY So nothing. She was just with a really cute guy in a boss car. We wondered who he was. \nSTEVE I wouldn't know. \nJUDY We do. His name's Bob Falfa. \nThe name registers with Steve. \nTerry and Debbie pull into the drive-in and park. Terry, his face swelling, groans as he leans toward the intercom. \nTERRY Help... I mean, I want two cherry cokes with lots of ice. Never mind, forget the cokes, just bring the ice, pronto. \nThe intercom repeats his order in a foreign language and suddenly Steve arrives and opens the door. \nSTEVE Out! OUT! \nTERRY What?? \nSTEVE I need the car--now. \nTerry gets out and Debbie gets out her side. Steve gets in. \nTERRY What's going on? \nSTEVE I'm about to find out. \nSteve roars out of the drive-in, leaving Terry and Debbie standing in an empty space. \nDEBBIE I don't believe it! You practically get killed trying to get your car back, then you let him have it. \nTerry looks at her, his eye swollen, his lip ballooning, his glasses broken. Finally, he gives up--it's not worth the trouble any longer. \nTERRY It's not my car. \nDEBBIE What? \nTERRY What? \nTERRY IT IS NOT MY CAR! \nDEBBIE Well, where is your car? \nTerry is upset now. \nTERRY I DON'T HAVE A CAR! \n", "test3_true": "Terry shakes his head. \nDEBBIE No car... well, how am I going to get home? \nJust then the car hop approaches with the two cokes on two trays. \nCAR HOP Where's your car? I gotta hook 'em to your car. \nTerry shrugs, standing in the empty stall, the carhop with the trays and Debbie watching. There's a low rumbling sound and the girls turn as John's deuce coupe glides into the stall next to them. Terry shuffles toward John's car, a defeated man. \nTerry leans against John's car and John looks out the window at him. \nJOHN What's wrong, Toad? You lose the car again? \nTERRY (softly) No... Steve took it. \nWOLFMAN (V.O.) It's a shame, Baby. I'll tell yuh... Got to take it easy when you're drivin' that car of yours. You got to cruise easy, baby. Don't be doin' any accidents or anything on me. \nAnd the radio plays \"Cryin' in the Chapel.\" \nJohn smiles and gets out of the car. He goes and opens his hood, making a last-minute check on something. Terry sits down gently on a curb by John. Debbie has been talking with some other boys. Eventually she wanders up slowly and looks at Terry. He looks up at her, then away, disgraced and embarrassed. She sits down by him and they're silent. \nDEBBIE You know, I had a pretty good time tonight. \nTERRY Oh come on, you're just-- \nDEBBIE No, no, really. I really had a good time. I mean, you picked me up and we got some hard stuff and saw a hold-up, and then we went to the Canal, you got your car stolen, and then I got to watch you gettin' sick, and then you got in this really bitchin' fight... I really had a good time. \nTerry looks at her, starting to regain a little cool. \nTERRY You think so? Yeah--well I guess I have pretty much fun every night. \nDEBBIE Anyway if you're not doing anything tomorrow night, why don't you come over? \nTERRY Yeah--well, I might be busy, you know. But we could--well, I got a little Vespa I just play around with. \nDEBBIE Really? Why that's almost a motorcycle. And I just love motorcycles. \nHe feels his swollen lip and she touches it. Then she leans over and kisses him. \nDEBBIE I got to go. \nTERRY Ow. \nDEBBIE Goodnight. \nTERRY See ya. \nShe smiles, walks off, swinging her purse. She looks over her shoulder and smiles. He smiles back. \nOUTSIDE RADIO STATION--CITROEN \nThe little Citroen bumps along a lonely dirt road, winding its way through dark peach orchards and wizened grape vineyards. Curt watches the deserted landscape when suddenly, the radio increases in volume and he turns it down. Then it begins to roar and distort eerily as the signal becomes more powerful. Then Curt sees it. \nHe stops the car and gets out. He stands looking at an isolated white frame house hitting in the moonlight. Curt looks up at a spidery radio antenna that rises toward the stars, its black wires humming in the stillness. \nCurt starts up the gravel walk to the door. Under the glare of a naked spotlight, he sees a small intercom which plays soft Rock and Roll. He hesitates, then pushes a buzzer. He pushes it again and finally a voice comes over the intercom. \nVOICE (V.O.) Yeah, who is it? \nCURT It's--I want to talk to the Wolfman. \nVOICE The Wolfman ain't here. \nCURT I know, but I got to get in touch with him. I got something to give him before-- \nVOICE We don't take no deliveries after eight. Come back tomorrow. \nCURT No, I can't. I want to ask him something that-- \nVOICE Dedications by phone is Diamond 75044. Wolfman Top 40 is Box 13, Chula Vista. Wolfman Sweatshirts is Wolf Enterprises, Bakersfield. 'Bye. \nCURT Listen, I got a right to talk to him. I listened to him every night for as long--for twelve years almost. I know him and it's personal and it'll only take a minute and I bet Wolfman would be upset if he knew a friend couldn't get in touch with-- \nA buzzer interrupts him and the door opens an inch. Curt pushes it open slowly--no one is there. A little scared, he goes inside and closes the door. \nINSIDE RADIO STATION \nCurt walks slowly down a dark eerie corridor, passing strangely lit rooms with electronic generators, humming dynamos and glassed-off booths filled with flashing electronic apparatus. \nCurt goes through this other-worldly maze until he comes to a small, dimly lit control booth. A figure inside is barely visible through the reflections in the double glass windows. The figure turns and walks up to the window. Curt backs off a bit. A face stares at him--long hair greased in a ducktail, a short chinbeard. Then he speaks, his voice filtering strangely through a hidden speaker. \n", "test3_id": 95}

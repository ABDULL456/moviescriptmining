{"train": "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2003) by Charlie Kaufman. \nINT. PUBLISHING HOUSE RECEPTION AREA - DAY \nIt's grand and modern.  Random House-Knopf-Taschen is etched on the wall in large gold letters.  An old woman enters carrying a tattered manuscript, maybe a thousand pages.  She seems haunted, hollow-eyed, sickly.  The young receptionist, dressed in a shiny, stretchy one-piece pantsuit, looks up. \nRECEPTIONIST Oh, hi. \nOLD WOMAN (apologetically) Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see -- \nRECEPTIONIST I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately.  I'm really sorry. \nOLD WOMAN Would you just try him?  You never know. As long as I'm here.  You never know. \nRECEPTIONIST Of course.  Please have a seat. \nThe old woman smiles and sits, the bulky manuscript on her lap.  She stares politely straight ahead. \nRECEPTIONIST (CONT'D) (quietly into headset) It's her -- I know, but couldn't you just -- Yes, I know, but -- I know, but she's old and it would be a nice -- Yes, sorry. (to old woman) I'm sorry, ma'am, he's not in right now. It's a crazy time of year for us. \nThe receptionist gestures toward a Christmas tree in the corner.  Its ornaments are holograms. \nOLD WOMAN This book -- It's essential that people read it because -- (gravely, patting the manuscript) -- It's the truth.  And only I know it. \nRECEPTIONIST (nodding sympathetically) Maybe after the holidays then. \nINT. TILED HALLWAY - DAY \nThe old woman carries her manuscript haltingly down a subway hall.  She stops to catch her breath, then continues and passes several archway with letters printed above them.  When she arrives at one topped by an LL, she slips a card in a slot.  A plastic molded chair drops into the archway.  She sits in the chair; it rises. \nINT. TUBE -DAY \nThe woman is still in the chair as it slips gracefully into a line of chairs shooting through a glass tube.  The other chairs are peopled with commuters.  We stay with the woman as she and the others travel over New York City in the tube. There are hundreds of these commuter tubes crisscrossing the skyline.  The woman glances at the manuscript in her lap. It's called: \nEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind \nThis serves as the movie's opening title.  The other credits follow, as the old woman studies commuters in passing tubes. Their faces are variously harsh and sad and lonely and blank. \nINT. WAITING ROOM - DAY \nSUBTITLED: FIFTY YEARS EARLIER \nEvery doctor's office waiting room: chairs against the wall, magazines on end tables, a sad-looking potted plant, generic seascape paintings on the walls.  The receptionist, Mary, 25, can be seen typing in the reception area.  Behind her are shelves and shelves of medical files.  The door opens and Clementine enters.  She's in her early thirties, zaftig in a faux fur winter coat over an orange hooded sweatshirt.  She's decidedly funky and has blue hair.  Mary looks up. \nMARY May I help you? \nCLEMENTINE (approaching reception area) Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak.  Clementine Kruczynski. \nMARY Yes, please have a seat.  He'll be right with you. \nClementine sits.  She looks tired, maybe hungover.  She picks up a magazine at random and thumbs without interest. \nINT. INNER OFFICE AREA - CONTINUOUS \nMary pads down the hallway.  She knocks on a closed door. \nMIERZWIAK (O.S.) Yes? \nMary opens the door, peeks in.  Howard Mierzwiak, 40's, professional, dry, sits behind his desk studying some papers. \nMARY Howard, your one o'clock. \nMIERZWIAK (not looking up) Thanks, Mary.  You can bring her in. \nShe smiles and nods.  It's clear she's in love.  It's equally clear that Mierzwiak doesn't have a clue.  Mary turns to leave. \nMIERZWIAK (CONT'D) (looking up) Mary... \nMARY (turning back) Yes? \nMIERZWIAK Order me a pastrami for after? \nMARY Cole slaw, ice tea? \nMIERZWIAK (nodding) Thanks. \nMARY Welcome, Howard. \nShe smiles and heads down the hall.  Stan, 30's, tall, spindly, and earnest in a lab coat pops out of a doorway. \nSTAN Boo. \nMARY Hi. \nShe glances back nervously at Mierzwiak's open door. \nSTAN Barely seen you all morning, kiddo. \nLater: Joel looks out at the ocean. \nLater: Joel sits on a rock and pulls out a notebook.  He opens it and writes with a gloved hand. \nJOEL January 13th, 2006.  Today I skipped work and took the train out to Montauk. (thinks) It's cold. (thinks some more) The sky is gray. (thinks some more) I don't know what else to say.  Nothing happens.  Nothing changes.  I saw Naomi last night.  We had sex.  It was weird to fall into our old familiar sex life so easily.  Like no time has passed.  After two years apart suddenly we're talking about getting together again.  I guess that's good. \nHe has no other thoughts.  He glances up, spots a female figure in the distance, walking in his direction.  She stands out against the gray in a fluorescent orange hooded sweatshirt.  It's Clementine.  He watches her for a bit, then as she nears, he goes back to his writing, or at least pretends to.  Once she passed, he watches her walk away.  She stops and stares out at the ocean.  Joel writes. \nJOEL (V.O.) (CONT'D) If I'm constitutionally incapable of making eye-contact with a woman I don't know.  I guess I'd better get back to Naomi. \nLater: Joel walks up near the beach houses closed for the season.  He peeks cautiously in a dark window. \nLater: Joel digs into the sand with a stick. \nINT. DINER - DAY \nIt's a local tourist place, but off-season empty.  Joel sits in a booth and eats a grilled cheese sandwich and a bowl of tomato soup.  An elderly couple drink coffee at the counter. Clementine enters, looks around, takes off her hood.  Joel glances at her bright blue hair.  She picks an empty booth and sits.  Joel studies her discreetly.  The waitress approaches her with a coffee pot. \nWAITRESS Coffee? \nCLEMENTINE God, yes.  You've saved my life! \nThe waitress pours the coffee. \nWAITRESS You know what you want yet? \nCLEMENTINE (laughing) Ain't that the question of the century. \nThe waitress is not amused. \nCLEMENTINE (CONT'D) You got grilled cheese and tomato soup? \nWAITRESS Yeah.  We're having a run on it. \nThe waitress heads to the grill.  Clementine fishes in her bag, brings the coffee cup under the table for a moment, pours something in, then brings the cup back up. \nCLEMENTINE (calling) And some cream, please. \nClementine looks around the place.  Her eyes meet Joel's before he is able to look away.  She smiles vaguely.  He looks embarrassed, then down at his journal.  Clementine pulls a book from her purse and starts to read.  Joel glances up, tries to see the cover.  It's blue.  He can't read the title. \nEXT. BEACH - DAY \nJoel stares out at the ocean.  Far down the beach Clementine stares at it, too.  Joel glances sideways at her then back at the ocean. \nEXT. MONTAUK TRAIN STATION PLATFORM - LATE AFTERNOON \nJoel sits on the bench waiting for a train.  Clementine enters the platform, sees Joel, the only other person there. She waves, sort of goofily enthusiastic, playing as if they're old friends.  He waves back, embarrassed.  She takes a seat on a bench far down the platform.  Joel stares at his hands, pulls out his journal and tries to write in order to conceal his awkwardness. \nINT. TRAIN - A BIT LATER \nJoel sits at the far end of the empty car and watches the slowly passing desolate terrain.  After a moment the door between cars opens and Clementine enters.  Joel looks up. Clementine is not looking at him; she busies herself deciding where to sit.  She settles on a seat at the opposite end of the car.  Joel looks out the window.  He feels her watching him.  The train is picking up speed.  Finally: \nCLEMENTINE (calling over the rumble) Hi! \nJoel looks over. \nJOEL I'm sorry. \nCLEMENTINE Why? \nJOEL Why what? \nCLEMENTINE Why are you sorry?  I just said hi. \nJOEL No, I didn't know if you were talking to me, so... \nShe looks around the empty car. \nCLEMENTINE Really? \nJOEL (embarrassed) Well, I didn't want to assume. \nCLEMENTINE Aw, c'mon, live dangerously.  Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car. \nJOEL Anyway.  Sorry.  Hi. \nClementine makes her way down the aisle towards Joel. \nCLEMENTINE It's okay if I sit closer?  So I don't have to scream.  Not that I don't need to scream sometimes, believe me. (pause) But I don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something. \nJOEL No, I mean, I don't know.  I can't really think of much to say probably. \nCLEMENTINE Oh.  So... \nShe hesitates in the middle of the car, looks back where she came from. \nJOEL I mean, it's okay if you want to sit down here.  I didn't mean to -- \nJOEL (CONT'D) I don't think your personality comes out of a tube.  I think the hair is just... a pretty topping. \nShe tears up, swallows, and kisses him on the cheek.  He's surprised and pleased and nervous. \nJOEL (CONT'D) (shyly formal) So, I enjoyed meeting you. \nCLEMENTINE You'll call me, right? \nJOEL Yeah. \nCLEMENTINE When? \nJOEL Tomorrow? \nCLEMENTINE Tonight.  Just to test out the phone lines and all. \nJOEL Okay. \nWe stay with Clementine as she watches Joel tromping through the snow and getting in his car. \nINT. JOEL'S CAR - NIGHT \nJoel speeds through the suburban Rockville Center neighborhood.  There is no snow on the ground.  He seems different, somehow foggy and disoriented. \nSUBTITLE:  THREE DAYS EARLIER \nHe arrives at his apartment building and parks. \nEXT. JOEL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS \nJoel gets out of his car, spots a van parked across the street.  There are two dark figures inside. \nVOICE-OVER Them. \nHe hurries inside the building. \nINT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nJoel enters, dumps his overcoat on a chair, turns off the lights, crosses to look furtively out the window.  It's snowing in large flakes which seem to fall only in the beam of a streetlight. \nJOEL It was snowing. \nVOICE-OVER There are two of them.  Couldn't make them out.  The orange glow of a cigarette. \nJoel squints to see inside the van.  Two dark figures talk. One sucks on a cigarette and s dim orange light momentarily illuminates the interior.  The figure in the driver seat rolls down his window and gives a cheery wave to Joel. \nJOEL The driver waved.  So casual, friendly. \nVOICE-OVER I'm like a joke to them. \nJoel pulls away from the window, his face blanched. \nVOICE-OVER I guess they figure they can act like they want.  They don't have to worry about me remembering. \nHe paces, mulling things over.  As he does, the scene starts to change, almost as if it is drying out. \nJOEL I might be making a mistake. \nVOICE-OVER Maybe I'm making a mistake.  Maybe I just need to learn to live with this.  First of all, I'll get over it.  Secondly, it happened.  Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it.  Who said that?  Churchill?  I'm not sure. But I don't care.  She did it to me.  I have to rid myself of this.  Fuck her. \nJOEL Fuck you, Clementine. \nThe colors bleach, the surroundings become slightly vague. Even Joel's persona and voice-over seem to alter, his emotional intensity becoming diffused.  Joel does not seem aware of this.  He stops pacing, takes a small vial from his pocket, dumps the lone pill onto his palm.  He looks at it. It's pink.  There's some illegible initials stamped on it. \nJOEL (CONT'D) Pink. (beat) There was a number on it.  I remember. AL 1718? (beat) I have to follow through with this.  I have no choice. \nVOICE-OVER The pill was pink, I remember.  It had some letters and numbers on it.  What were they?  AL 1718?  AL something.  Four digits.  I don't like taking pills when I don't know what they are.  I have no choice. \nHe swallows it, peeks out the window again, takes off his clothes, slips into a pair of pajamas fresh from the store packaging.  He sits on the edge of the bed, dials the phone. \nJOEL (CONT'D) We're sorry, the number you have dialed... (beat) Screw you, Clementine, for doing this ... \nRECORDED VOICE We're sorry, the number you have dialed is no longer in service.  If you think you have reached this recording in error \nJOEL (CONT'D) Bye. \nJoel hangs up and lies on his back on the bed.  By now the scene is lifeless, almost a husk.  He hears the apartment building door open.  He hears footsteps. \nJOEL (CONT'D) It's them. \nVOICE-OVER It's too late. \nHis eyelids are getting heavy.  He closes his eyes. \nBLACK. \nHe hears a key in his apartment door. \nStan nods professionally. \nSTAN Mr. Barish. \nJOEL How exactly is this going to work tonight? \nAs Mierzwiak talks, the room colors start to fade, Mierzwiak's tone of voice is also affected; it becomes dry and monotonous. \nMIERZWIAK We'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards -- There is an emotional core to each of our memories -- As we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation process --  By the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared.  Like a dream upon waking. \nJOEL Is there any sort of risk of brain damage? \nMIERZWIAK Well, technically, the procedure itself is brain damage, but on a par with a night of heavy drinking.  Nothing you'll miss. \nJoel looks quizzically at the eroding environment.  Suddenly he gets it. \nJOEL It's happening now!  I'm already in my brain. \nMierzwiak looks at the fading room. \nMIERZWIAK Yes, I suppose you are. (back in his faded memory persona) So, let's get started -- If we want the procedure underway tonight, we have some work to do. \nJoel is sitting in a chair.  Electrodes connect him to some electronic machinery monitored by Stan.  Mierzwiak watches from the corner. \nSTAN We use the articles you brought to create a map of Clementine in your brain. Tonight while you sleep we'll be able to trace the map and erase. \nJOEL But you're tracing and erasing now.  It's already started.  I'm home in my bed. \nStan pulls a snow globe from one of Joel's bags, shows it to Joel.  The equipment registers Joel's reaction. \nSTAN Very good. \nStan pulls out a potato dressed as a Vegas showgirl.  Joel studies it.  The machines register his response. \nMIERZWIAK We'll dispose of these mementos when we're done here.  That way you won't be confused later by their unexplainable presence in your home. \nStan pulls out a coffee mug with a photo of Clementine printed on it.  Joel looks at the cup.  The machines record his reaction. \nSTAN Good.  We're getting healthy read-outs. \nThe room, Stan, and Mierzwiak are now vague and wispy. \nSTAN'S VOICE Patrick, do me a favor -- \nJoel is watching Stan.  Stan is not speaking, yet his voice continues. \nSTAN'S VOICE (CONT'D) -- and check the voltage levels, I'm not wiping as clean as I would like here. \nJoel looks up.  Stan's voice seems to be coming from above. \nINT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nJoel lies on his back in fresh pajamas.  His eyes are closed and electrodes connect his head to several machines.  The machines are operated by Stan, now in grubby street clothes and in need of a shave, and by Patrick, dressed similarly. The monitor on one of the machines traces a myriad of light blips running like streams through an image of Joel's brain. Stan presses buttons and operates a joystick, aiming for the lines.  Patrick (who we saw earlier with Clementine at the bookstore) studies a meter on one of the machines. \nPATRICK The voltage looks fine. \nSTAN Then check the connections. \nPatrick fiddles with some jacks. \nPATRICK Does that help? \nSTAN Yeah, that looks better.  Thanks. \nINT. LAB ROOM - DAY \nThe memory is becoming vague, characters' affects flat.  Stan pulls out a pile of loose-leaf pages.  Mierzwiak smiles. \nMIERZWIAK Ah, your journal.  This will be invaluable. \nSTAN (reading) December 15th, 2004.  I met someone tonight.  Oh, Christ:  I don't know what to do.  Her name is Clementine and she's amazing.  So alive and spontaneous and passionate and sensitive.  Things with Naomi and I have been stagnant for so long. \nThe scene is just a shell of itself as Stan rattles on. \nSTAN'S VOICE I think we got this one.  Let's push on. \nJoel looks up at the ceiling. \nINT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - DAY \nJoel, snapped into a new memory, cries as he fills two large plastic garbage bags with mementos of his relationship with Clementine.  There are funny little gifts, wind-up toys, some potatoes dressed as women, some clothing Clementine has left there, some CD's.  He pulls a big clump of pages out of his loose-leaf journal and dumps them in the bag. \nHe gets some clean loose-leaf paper and writes: \nDecember 15, 2004   Nothing much happened today.  I stayed home.  Naomi worked on her dissertation. \nThe scene is fading as he continues to write. \nPHONE MACHINE VOICE You have no messages. \nINT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nJoel enters, checks his phone machine: zero messages. \nINT. JOEL'S OFFICE - DAY \nJoel gets off the elevator, approaches Carmen, who is in conversation with someone else. \nJOEL Sorry, Carmen.  Any messages? \nCarmen shakes her head \"no\", goes back to her conversation. \nINT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nJoel checks his machine: zero messages. \nVOICE-OVER That's it.  I'm just gonna-- \nWithout a moment's hesitation, he dials the phone. \nVOICE-OVER (CONT'D) I'm gonna tell her I'm through playing games and -- \nRECORDED VOICE The number you have dialed has been disconnected. \nJoel's eyes bug. \nINT. ROB AND CARRIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nJoel sits across Rob and Carrie, mid-40's. \nJOEL Why would she do that? \nVAGUE RECORDED VOICE -- If you think you have reached this recording in error, please check your number and dial again. \nCARRIE I don't know, honey.  It's horrible. \nJOEL She's punishing me for being honest.  I should just go to her house. \nROB I don't think you should go there, Joel. \nJOEL Yeah, I don't want to seem desperate. \nCARRIE Maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on.  Just make a clean break. \nJOEL I don't know.  I'm so... I can't believe she'd be so goddamn immature! \nROB Joel, look, the thing is -- \nCARRIE (agitated, interrupting) Joel, honey... We have to feed the dog. Would you just wait here?  Just a second. \nJoel nods, confused, as Rob and Carrie leave the room and close the door behind them.  Joel hears a hushed argument ensue in the hall.  He notices the dog asleep on the floor. He grabs a magazine off the coffee table, flips through it distractedly as he paces, puts it down, picks up another.  A subscription card falls to the floor.  He picks it up and is about to shove it back in the magazine when he sees it is not a subscription card at all.  It reads: \nClementine Kruczynski has had Joel Barish erased from her memory.  Please never mention their relationship to her again.  Thank you. \nLacuna Ltd. 610 11th Avenue, NY, NY \nJoel stares at the card, incredulous. \nLater: Rob and Carrie are now back in the room. \nCARRIE (CONT'D) You weren't supposed to see that. \nJOEL They can't erase memories.  It's a joke. It's a nasty Clementine hoax. \nCARRIE Sweetie, we called the company. \nJoel just stands there. \nClose-up of a vague dictionary page. \nVOICE-OVER Lacuna:  Noun.  A blank, a missing portion, especially in a manuscript. \nINT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nJoel is on the phone pacing. \nCARRIE'S VOICE You can't tell her, Joel.  They explained that.  Like waking a sleepwalker.  It might have a devastating effect. \nINT. JOEL'S CAR - NIGHT \nJoel drives past vague local landmark. \nCARRIE'S VOICE Think about it: to be told you lived an existence of which you have no recollection. \nJOEL'S VOICE But what am I supposed to do? \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nJoel looks at his dented car, looks at Clementine clomping off in the distance. \nINT. JOEL'S CAR - CONTINUOUS \nJoel drives to catch up with Clementine.  He rolls down his window to talk to her. \nJOEL Let me drive you home. \nCLEMENTINE (without turning) Fuck you, Joel.  Faggot. \nJOEL Look at it out here.  It's falling apart. I'm erasing you.  And I'm happy. \nShe keeps clomping. \nJOEL (CONT'D) You did it to me.  I can't believe you did this to me.  By morning you'll be gone.  Ha! \nHe stops the car, gets out. \nEXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS \nIt's a street you might see in a dream, more an impression of a quiet street than an actual one, with what little detail there is obscured in darkness.  Joel wanders it.  In the distance Clementine walks off, but as in an animated loop, she doesn't get any farther away.  It's lonely. \nPATRICK'S VOICE See, remember that girl?  The one we did last week?  The one with the potatoes? \nJoel looks up, startled. \nSTAN'S VOICE Yeah, that's this guy's girlfriend.  Was. \nINT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nStan watches the screen.  Patrick paces, fidgets, looks at the unconscious Joel. \nPATRICK I gotta tell you something.  I kind of fell in love with her last night. \nSTAN She was unconscious, Patrick. \nPATRICK She was beautiful.  So sweet and funky and voluptuous.  I kind of stole a pair of her panties, is what. \nSTAN Jesus, Patrick! \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nOn the vague street Joel listens to Patrick and Stan. \nPATRICK'S VOICE I know.  It's not like... I mean, they were clean and all. \nSTAN'S VOICE Look, just don't tell me this stuff.  I don't want to know this shit. \nPATRICK'S VOICE Yeah, okay. \nSTAN'S VOICE We have work to do. \nThere's a click and Joel finds himself in -- \nINT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nJoel and Clementine sit and eat dinner in front of the TV. It's hard to make out what they're watching. They sit on opposite ends of the couch.  They look bored. The scene quickly degenerates.  The room fades. \nPATRICK'S VOICE Okay, but there's more. \nJoel listens. \nPATRICK'S VOICE (CONT'D) After we did her, I went to where she worked and I asked her out. \nJoel looks over at the faded Clementine across the couch. She stares straight ahead at the TV. \nSTAN'S VOICE Patrick... do you know how unethical... \nJOEL That must be the guy I saw you with. \nVOICE-OVER In the bookstore that night.  The skinny guy. \nThere's a click and Joel finds himself in -- \nINT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nJoel watches TV.  Clementine walks by in her underwear, looks at the TV.  She slips into a skirt. \nCLEMENTINE How can you watch this crap? \nJOEL Where are you going? \nCLEMENTINE I'm fucking crawling out of my skin. \nThe scene starts to fade.  Clementine puts on her shoes and heads out the door. \nPatrick opens the door.  Mary stands there in a winter coat, carrying a backpack. \nMARY (coolly) Oh, hey, Patrick. \nPATRICK Hi, Mary.  How's it going? \nShe walks past him. \nSTAN Hey, you. \nStan and Mary kiss.  She looks down at Joel as she takes off her coat. \nMARY It's freezing out. \nSTAN You found us okay? \nMARY Yeah. (re: Joel) Poor guy. (looking around) Have anything to drink? \nSTAN We haven't checked. \nMARY Well, allow me to do the honors.  It's fucking freezing and I need something. \nShe heads into the kitchen.  Stan turns back to monitor the slivers of light. \nPATRICK Mary hates me.  I've never been popular with the ladies. \nSTAN Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties. \nPATRICK (guilty beat) Okay, There's more, Stan -- \nStan looks over at Patrick.  Mary returns with a bottle of scotch and two glasses. \nMARY Hey, hey. \nShe pours the whiskey. \nMARY (CONT'D) Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did you? \nPATRICK Nah, I don't know. \nMary hands a glass to Stan.  She holds hers up in a toast. \nMARY Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders. \nMary and Stan click glasses. \nMARY (CONT'D) Nietzsche.  Beyond Good and Evil.  Found it my Bartletts. \nSTAN That's a good one. \nMARY Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard!  It seems really appropriate. \nSTAN (a little sulky) It's a good one all right. \nPATRICK What's your bartlett's? \nSTAN It's a quote book. \nMARY I love quotes.  So did Winston Churchill. He actually has a quotation in Bartlett's about Bartlett's.  Isn't that trippy? \nPATRICK (trying to engage) Yeah.  Cool. \nMARY \"The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts.\" \nPATRICK Very cool.  Trippy. \nMARY I like to read what smart people say.  So many beautiful, important things. \nSTAN Yup. \nMARY Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart?  Important? \nSTAN (beat) Yup. \nPATRICK Definitely! \nMARY I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day. \nStan focuses on the monitor.  Mary pours herself another drink. \nPATRICK Definitely. \nINT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nIt's dark.  Joel and Clementine are in bed.  The memory is already in the midst of being erased.  Clementine is talking in a monotonous, robotic manner. \nCLEMENTINE You don't tell me things, Joel.  I'm an open book.  I tell you everything.  Every damn embarrassing thing.  You don't trust me. \nSTAN Listen, it's not erasing. \nHe makes his way, naked, to the computer screen. \nSTAN (CONT'D) It's not erasing.  He's off the screen. \nMARY Where? \nSTAN I don't know.  He's not on the map. \nStan tries to break through his marijuana haze.  He fiddles nervously with the equipment. \nSTAN (CONT'D) I don't know what to do!  I don't know what to do!  Crap.  Crap... \nMARY Well, what should we do? \nSTAN I don't know!  I just said that! \nMARY Sor-ry (beat) We have to do something.  He can't wake up half done. \nSTAN Shit! \nHe jerks the joystick spastically.  Mary, also naked, gets up and looks over his shoulder at the screen. \nMARY (definitely) We should call Howard. \nStan turns and looks at her.  He's stoned and trying to understand her motivation. \nSTAN No way.  I can handle this. \nMARY This guy's only half cooked.  There's no time to fuck around, Stan. \nStan tries to think.  He paces.  Mary watches him.  Finally: \nSTAN (without making eye contact) Okay. \nHe dials the phone, waits. \nSTAN (CONT'D) Hello, Howard? \nINT. MIERZWIAK'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nThe room is dark.  A groggy Mierzwiak is in bed on the phone. His wife lies beside him, eyes open, listening. \nMIERZWIAK Stan?  What's going on? \nSTAN'S VOICE The guy we're doing?  He's disappeared from the map.  I can't find him anywhere. \nMIERZWIAK Okay, what happened right before he disappeared? \nSTAN'S VOICE I was away from the monitor for a second. I had it on automatic.  I had to go pee. \nMIERZWIAK Well, where was Patrick? \nSTAN'S VOICE He went home sick. \nMIERZWIAK Jesus.  All right, what's the address. \nSTAN'S VOICE 1062 Sherman Drive.  Apartment 1E, Rockville Center. \nMierzwiak writes it down on a bedside not pad.  He hangs up. \nINT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nStan hangs up the phone, looks at Mary. \nMARY He's coming? \nSTAN You better go. \nMARY Hell no. \nShe starts getting dressed. \nMARY (CONT'D) Shit, I'm so stoned.  I don't want him to see me stoned.  Stop being stoned, Mary! \nShe hurries into the bathroom with her bag. \nMARY (CONT'D) (O.S.) (CONT'D) God, I look like shit!  God! \nMary slams the bathroom door.  Stan puts his head in his hands. \nINT. KITCHEN - DAY \nJoel and Clementine are in the playpen.  Joel's oversized mother reaches down as she hurries by and pats Joel on the head. \nMOTHER How's my baby boy? \nJoel is being bathed in the oversized sink by his oversized mother.  Clementine sits in the water with him, laughing. The mother doesn't seem to see her. \nMOTHER Little baby getting awwwl cleean.  Awl clean. \nJOEL (to Clementine) I love getting bathed in the sink.  It's such a feeling of security. \nCLEMENTINE (giggling) I've never seen you happier. \nThe elements of the scene flash explosively away:  Joel's mother, his Huckleberry Hound doll, the details of the kitchen, Clementine.   Joel is thrown into: \nINT. CAR - NIGHT \nHe sits with Clementine in the parked car, outside a drive-in movie theater.  The movie on the giant screen is partially obscured by a fence.  Joel and Clementine drink wine. \nINT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nMierzwiak looks up from the computer screen. \nMIERZWIAK Okay, we're back in. \nMARY That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist. \nMIERZWIAK Well, thank you, Mary. \nSTAN (sighing) You get some sleep, Howard.  I'll take it from here. \nMIERZWIAK Yeah, probably a good idea. \nINT. CAR - NIGHT \nClementine and Joel laugh as they try to give voice to what the characters on the screen are saying. \nCLEMENTINE But can't you see... I love you, Antoine. \nJOEL Don't call me Antoine.  My name is Wally. \nCLEMENTINE Yes, but I can't love a man named Wally. \nShe starts to fade.  The scene starts to fade.  Joel remembers their previous plan. \nJOEL They found us before.  The plan didn't work.  I don't know what to do now. \nCLEMENTINE (mouthing to woman on screen) Hide me somewhere deeper?  Somewhere buried? \nJoel grabs her.  They run off just as the scene decays into a husk behind them. \nINT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nStan is back at the controls.  Mierzwiak's at the door with Mary. \nSTAN Howard, they've disappeared again. \nMIERZWIAK Oh dear. \nMARY I'm so sorry, Howard, you must be tired. \nHe nods, distractedly.  She smiles to herself as he heads back to the equipment. \nEXT. SCHOOLYARD - AFTERNOON \nJoel, now the size of a junior high school kid and dressed accordingly, is peering around the corner of the school building toward the bike rack.  Clementine is with him, dressed as she was in the parked car. \nCLEMENTINE Look at you, cutey!  What are we doing? \nJOEL This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the shit out of me. \nVOICE-OVER I'm terrified.  I thought if I hung around the art room long enough, he'd go home and I could get my bike. \nThey head toward the bike rack.  Joel's is the only bike remaining. \nCLEMENTINE (CONT'D) Poor Joel. \nThey're at the bike rack and a bunch of kids, including giant, fat Joe Early come around the corner. \nJOE EARLY Hi, Jill. \nJOEL He calls me Jill.  Everyone calls me Jill after this. \nThe other kids laughs. \nJOEL Just shut up, Joe.  I'm going home. \nJOE EARLY I don't think so.  We're fighting. \nJOEL I don't want to fight you. \nThe kids start chanting, \"fight, fight, fight...\"  Joe Early throws a wild punch that hits Joel in the side.  joel falls and stays down, covering himself. \nMIERZWIAK I'm getting the hang of it.  I still understand it.  But I'm finding him quickly enough.  I'm hopeful there won't be too much peripheral eradication. \nMary sits on the bed. \nMARY (a little giggly) I like watching you work. \nStan sighs, grabs his coat. \nSTAN I'll go out for a smoke.  If no one minds. \nMIERZWIAK (not looking up) That's fine, Stan. \nMary doesn't say anything.  Stan huffs and is out the door. Mierzwiak continues to find and erase points of light.  Mary gets up her courage to speak. \nMARY Do you like quotes, Howard? \nMIERZWIAK How do you mean? \nMARY Oh, um, like famous quotes.  I find reading them inspirational to me.  And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too. \nMIERZWIAK Oh.  Well, I'd love to hear some. \nMary is thrilled, beside herself.  She tries to calm down. \nMARY Okay, um, there's one that goes \"Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders.\" \nMIERZWIAK Is that Nietzsche? \nMARY Yeah, yeah it is, Howard.  And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know. \nMIERZWIAK It's a good quote, Mary.  I'm glad we both know it. \nHe smiles at her.  She's flustered, flattered. \nMARY (sputtering) There's another one I like, I read.  It's by Pope Alexander. \nMIERZWIAK Alexander Pope? \nMARY Yes, shit.  Oops, sorry! (puts hand over mouth) Sorry.  It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it.  Like I psyched myself out. \nMIERZWIAK It's no big deal. \nMARY You are such a sweetheart. \nThere's an embarrassed moment as that line hangs in the air. Then Mary plunges ahead to bury it. \nMARY (CONT'D) Anyway, the quote goes \"How happy is the blameless Vestal's lot!  The world forgetting, by the world forgot: Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind!  Each prayer accepted, and each wish resign'd\". \nShe smiles, proud and embarrassed. \nMIERZWIAK That's lovely. \nMARY Really?  I thought it was appropriate maybe.  That's all. (beat, then quickly) I really admire the work that you do.  I know it's not proper to be so familiar but I guess since we're outside the workplace I feel a certain liberty to -- \nMIERZWIAK It's fine, Mary.  I'm happy to hear it. \nMARY Okay.  Good.  Great.  Thanks. (blurting) I like you, Howard... an awful lot.  Is that terrible? \nMierzwiak seems momentarily taken aback, then returns to his unflappable self. \nMIERZWIAK You're a wonderful girl, Mary. \nShe leans over and kisses him, then pulls away quickly. \nMARY I've loved you for a very long time.  I'm sorry!  I shouldn't have said that. \nMIERZWIAK I've got a wife, Mary.  Kids.  You know that. \nMARY (suddenly weepy) I wish I was your wife.  I wish I had your kids. \nMierzwiak comforts her with a hug.  It turns into kiss.  He pulls away. \nMIERZWIAK We can't do this. \nMARY No you're right.  Once again.  You're a decent man, Howard. \nHe smiles sadly at her.  She smiles courageously at him. \nMIERZWIAK I want you to know it's not because I'm not interested.  If that means anything. \nThey look at each other a long while, then Howard goes back to locating and eradicating blips of lights. \nEXT. JOEL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT \nStan sits in the van and smokes a cigarette.  He has an unobstructed view into Joel's bedroom window.  He watches Mierzwiak and Mary.  They're talking as Howard works.  It appears to be a very serious discussion.  A car pulls up outside.  Stan turns to see.  A middle-aged woman gets out, checks the address on Joel's building, approaches the only lit window, watches Mierzwiak and Mary inside.  Mierzwiak's resolve has apparently weakened and he and Mary kiss again. This time it leads to groping, partial undressing, and falling onto the bed alongside the unconscious Joel.  The woman in the window is transfixed.  As Mierzwiak fumbles to unzip his pants, he catches sight of the woman in the window. He practically shrieks and jumps up. \nEXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY \nThe scene poops out of existence with a flash of light. \nINT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nJoel finds himself eating Chinese food and sitting across from Clementine.  He is ragged and jarred. \nJOEL I'm done, Clem.  I'm just going to ride it out.  Hiding is clearly not working. \nCLEMENTINE Yeah. \nJOEL I want to enjoy my little time left with you. \nCLEMENTINE This is our first \"date\" date. \nJOEL Do you remember what we talked about? \nCLEMENTINE Naomi, I guess. \nJOEL Yeah. \nCLEMENTINE What was I wearing? \nJOEL God, I should know.  Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper. \nCLEMENTINE Egad, were you horrified? \nJOEL No!  I think you were wearing that black dress, y'know, with the buttons. \nShe is wearing the black dress. \nCLEMENTINE No, you were with me when I bought that. At that place on East 6th.  It was later. \nINT. DRESS SHOP - SHOP \nThe scene has already been erased.  It's just a decayed husk. A vague Joel watches a vague Clementine model a black dress. \nINT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nClementine wears a generic black dress now. \nJOEL Right.  Something black though. \nCLEMENTINE I'll buy that.  Black's always good. \nJOEL We did talk about Naomi. \nCLEMENTINE I said: Are you sure?  You seem unsure. \nJOEL I'm sure, I said. \nCLEMENTINE But you weren't.  I could tell. \nJOEL I was so nervous.  I remember I couldn't think of anything to say.  There were long silences. \nThere is a long silence. \nJOEL (CONT'D) I thought I was foolish.  I thought I'd mistaken infatuation for love.  You said: \nCLEMENTINE So what.  Infatuation is good, too. \nJOEL And I didn't have an argument. \nINT. CAR - NIGHT \nJoel and Clementine pull up to Clementine's house. \nJOEL I dropped you off after.  You said -- \nCLEMENTINE (Mae West) Come up and see me... now. \nJOEL It's very late. \nCLEMENTINE Yes, exactly.  Exactly my point. \nINT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nJoel and Clementine are in the midst of awkward shy sex. \nJOEL This was our first time. \nThe scene starts to fade.  Joel watches Clementine disappear. \nINT. LACUNA RECEPTION AREA - NIGHT \nMary enters the dark room, frazzled.  She flips on the fluorescent lights and searches the file folders, finds one with her name on it.  Her jaw drops.  With a shaky hand, she puts the tape into the player on her desk and presses \"play.\" \nMIERZWIAK VOICE Okay, so just tell me what you remember. And we'll take it from there. \nNAOMI Don't say \"we\" when you mean \"you.\" \nJOEL I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy?  If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition. \nNAOMI Bullshit.  Who is it?  You met someone. \nJOEL No.  I just need some space, maybe. \nNAOMI The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems. \nJOEL It's not somebody else. \nVOICE-OVER I hate myself. \nNaomi walks off.  Joel watches her.  The scene fades. \nINT. BORDER'S BOOKSTORE - NIGHT \nJoel enters, looks around.  There's no sign of Clementine. Joel approaches a male employee. \nJOEL Is there a Clementine who works here? \nMALE EMPLOYEE #1 (calling to another male employee) Mark, is Clem on tonight? \nMALE EMPLOYEE #2 On my dick, bro. (turns, sese Joel, embarrassed) Oh, hey.  Yeah, I think she's upstairs in Philosophy. \nJoel climbs stairs, searches the aisle, spots Clementine. \nJOEL Hi. \nShe turns. \nCLEMENTINE I didn't think you'd show your face around me again.  I figured you were humiliated.  You did run away, after all. \nJOEL Sorry to track you down like this.  I'm not a stalker.  But I needed to see you. \nCLEMENTINE (seemingly uninterested) Yeah? \nJOEL I'd like to... take you out or something. \nCLEMENTINE Well, you're married. \nJOEL Not yet.  Not married. \nCLEMENTINE Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance.  So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there.  If you want to be with me, you're with me. \nJOEL Okay. \nCLEMENTINE So make your domestic decisions and maybe we'll talk again. \nShe goes back to stacking.  Joel stands there helplessly. \nJOEL I just think that you have some kind of... quality that seems really important to me. \nThe scene is disintegrating.  Clementine's speech is delivered without passion. \nCLEMENTINE Joel, I'm not a concept.  I want you to just keep that in your head.  Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind.  Don't assign me yours. \nJOEL I remember that speech really well. \nCLEMENTINE (smiling) I had you pegged, didn't I? \nJOEL You had the whole human race pegged. \nCLEMENTINE Probably. \nJOEL I still thought you were going to save me.  Even after that. \nCLEMENTINE I know. \nJOEL It would be different, if we could just give it another go around. \nCLEMENTINE Remember me.  Try your best.  Maybe we can. \nThe scene is gone. \nINT. ROB AND CARRIE'S CAR - NIGHT \nJoel sits forlornly in the back seat.  Rob drives and Carrie sits in the front passenger seat.  The car stops in front of Joel's apartment building. \nJOEL Thanks, guys. \nCARRIE I hope you feel better, sweetie. \nJOEL Yeah. \nCARRIE Say hi to Naomi. \nINT. ROB AND CARRIE'S KITCHEN - DAY \nFaded.  Carrie and Joel sit at the table with coffee. \nCARRIE Who was the girl you walked off with? \nJOEL No one. \nEXT. BEACH PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nRob, Carrie, and Joel emerge from the car, parked amidst a small cluster of cars in an otherwise empty parking lot. \nEXT. BEACH - NIGHT \nJoel watches his shoes in the sand as he trudges along. \nCARRIE Is this the right way? \nEXT. BEACH - MOMENTS LATER \nJoel, Rob, and Carrie step out of the brush and see a bonfire down the beach.  People and music can be heard. \nEXT. BEACH - LATER \nJoel sits on a log, a paper plate of chicken and corn on his lap.  People warm themselves at the fire.  Joel watches couples talking, kissing, Rob sharing a joint with a guy. \nJOEL You were down by the surf.  I could just make you out in the dark. \nJoel looks down to the water.  There's Clementine, in her orange hooded sweatshirt, looking out to sea. \nJOEL (CONT'D) Your back to me.  In that orange sweatshirt I would come to know so well and even hate eventually.  At the time I thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt. \nVOICE-OVER I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean. \nJOEL (CONT'D) But I went back to my food.  The next thing I remember, I felt someone sitting next to me and I saw the orange sleeve out of the corner of my eye. \nA shot of the orange sleeve.  Joel looks up. \nCLEMENTINE Hi there. \nJOEL Hi. \nVOICE-OVER I was so nervous.  What were you doing there, I wondered.  Your hair was lime green.  Green revolution. \nA shot of her green hair. \nJOEL You said... \nCLEMENTINE I saw you sitting over here.  By yourself.  I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either. \nJOEL Yeah.  I don't ever know what to say. \nCLEMENTINE I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.  I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser.  Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod. \nJOEL Even then I didn't believe you entirely. I thought how could you be talking to me if you couldn't talk to people? \nVOICE-OVER But I thought, I don't know, I thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what I was feeling and that you were attracted to it. \nCLEMENTINE But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know?  I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff? \nVOICE-OVER And I just liked you so much. \nCLEMENTINE (CONT'D) You did?  You liked me? \nJOEL You know what I did. \nCLEMENTINE Yeah, I know.  I'm fishing. \nJOEL You said -- \nShe picks a drumstick off of Joel's plate. \nCLEMENTINE I'm Clementine.  Can I borrow a piece of your chicken? \nJOEL And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers. \nJOEL (CONT'D) I remember -- \nVOICE-OVER The grease on your chin in the bonfire light. \nShot of a smudge of chicken grease on Clementine's chin. \nCLEMENTINE Oh God, how horrid. \nJOEL I'm Joel. \nVOICE-OVER No, it was lovely. \nShe finds a window that's unlatched.  She lifts it. \nCLEMENTINE (CONT'D) Cool. \nJOEL What are you doing? \nCLEMENTINE It's freezing out here. \nShe scrambles in the window.  Joel looks around, panicked. \nJOEL (whisper) Clementine. \nVOICE-OVER I couldn't believe you did that.  I was paralyzed with fear. \nThe front door opens and Clementine stands there beckoning. \nCLEMENTINE (CONT'D) C'mon, man.  The water's fine.  Nobody's coming here tonight, believe me.  This place is closed up.  Electricity's off. \nJOEL I hesitated for what seemed like forever. \nCLEMENTINE I could see you wanted to come in, Joel. \nHe walks cautiously toward the door. \nCLEMENTINE (CONT'D) As soon as you walked in.  I knew I had you.  You knew I knew that, right? \nINT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nJoel enters the darkened and Clementine closes the door behind him. \nJOEL I knew. \nCLEMENTINE I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass. \nJOEL It's dark. \nCLEMENTINE Yeah.  What's your girlfriend's name? \nJOEL Naomi. \nShe's searching through drawers for something.  She pulls out a flashlight, shines it in Joel's face. \nCLEMENTINE Ah-ha!  Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet. \nJOEL I think we should go. \nCLEMENTINE No, it's our house!  Just tonight -- (looking at envelope on counter) -- we're David and Ruth Laskin.  Which one do you want to be?  I prefer to be Ruth but I'm flexible. (opens cabinet) Alcohol!  You make drinks.  I'm going find the bedroom and slip into something more Ruth.  I'm ruthless at the moment. \nShe runs upstairs, giggling.  The room is drying out, turning into a husk. \nJOEL (calling after her) I really should go.  I really need to catch my ride. \nVOICE-OVER I didn't want to go.  I was too nervous. I thought, maybe you were a nut.  But you were exciting.  You called from upstairs. \nCLEMENTINE (CONT'D) (flat) So go. \nJOEL I did.  I walked out the door.  I felt like I was a scared little kid.  I thought you knew that about me.  I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation.  You said, \"so go\" with such disdain. \nCLEMENTINE (CONT'D) (poking her head downstairs) What if you stay this time? \nJOEL I walked out the door.  There's no more memory. \nCLEMENTINE Come back and make up a good-bye at least.  Let's pretend we had one. \nClementine comes downstairs, vague and robotic, making her way through the decaying environment. \nCLEMENTINE (CONT'D) Bye, Joel. \nJOEL I love you. \nShe smiles.  They kiss.  It fades. \nCLEMENTINE I -- \nEXT. BEACH - NIGHT \nJoel finds himself hurrying back to the bonfire.  This scene, too, is disintegrating.  It dries up and Joel is just standing there on a faded beach at night, the bonfire frozen in the distance like a photograph. \nINT. CAR - NIGHT \nJoel sits in the back seat, Rob and Carrie are in the front. \nCARRIE Did you have fun? \nJoel nods glumly. \nCarrie continues to talk, but her voice goes under as Joel studies the faded husks of memories, piled like refuse outside the moving car window.  He sees dried-out version of previous interactions with Clementine playing out in loops. He looks back and sees the memory of his ride home from the beach with Rob and Carrie.  It, too, is decaying.  Soon all has crumbled into dust.  Everything goes black. \nJOEL Hi... Naomi?  Yeah, hi!  How are you?  I know, I know.  It's been a long time. Not too much.  You?  Oh, that's great! Congratulations!  Maybe I could buy you dinner to celebrate?  Tonight?  I'm free. Okay, good! \nINT. LACUNA RECEPTION AREA - DAY \nMary does paperwork at her desk.  She looks through her reception window at the sad people waiting in the lobby with their bags of stuff. \nINT. MIERZWIAK'S OFICE - CONTINUOUS \nMierzwiak dials his phone and waits.  He hangs up.  Mary enters with the papers. \nMARY I need this signed, Howard. \nHe takes it, unable to make eye contact.  He signs it, hands it back. \nMARY (CONT'D) Thanks. (beat) So... do we talk about this... or what? \nMIERZWIAK I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary. I want to do the right thing here. \nMARY Do you love me?  Did you love me? Something.  I listened to my tape.  I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year.  It's like listening to someone else's story.  I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked.  I can't even say \"naked\" to you! \nMIERZWIAK I have a family, Mary. \nMARY You made me have an abortion. \nMIERZWIAK It was a mutual decision. \nMARY You made me have you erased!  I loved you.  I love you!  How could you -- \nMIERZWIAK I didn't make you.  You thought it best. (off her stare) But, look, I take full responsibility. \nShe looks at him for a long while.  Then, out of frustration, she screams. \nINT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nJoel sits across from Naomi. \nNAOMI (oddly cautious) So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time? \nJOEL It's been a pretty lonely couple of years. \nNAOMI I'm sorry. \nJOEL Well, it was my fault -- the break-up. I'm sorry. \nNAOMI Oh, sweetie.  It really does cut both ways.  We were taking each other for granted and -- \nJOEL I miss you. \nNAOMI Miss you, too. (awkward pause) I have been seeing someone for a little while. \nJOEL (trying for enthusiasm) Oh!  Great.  That's great! \nNAOMI A religion instructor at Columbia.  A good guy.  He's a good guy. \nJOEL I'm sorry.  I really shouldn't have -- \nNAOMI I'm glad you called. \nINT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nJoel and Naomi are in bed having sex.  There are certain sexual routines, habits, they have fallen back into almost immediately.  She sticks her tongue in his ear in a way that's trying to be sexual but just feels embarrassing to him.  They finish and lie there. \nJOEL So you think the dissertation will get published? \nNAOMI I don;t know.  I'm not sure there's a big public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny. \nINT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nClementine lies in bed with Patrick. \nEXT. COMMUTER TRAIN STATION - MORNING \nThe platform is crowded with business commuters.  Joel is among them. The platform across the tracks from them is empty.  Suddenly, Joel turns and makes his way through the crowd.  He climbs the stairs, crosses the overpass and makes his way to the empty platform.  An almost empty train pulls into that platform.  Joel gets on the train and watches the business commuters through the dirty window as his train pulls out of the station. \nINT. MARY'S APARTMENT - MORNING \nMary gets out of bed.  She has been crying all night.  She's a wreck.  She puts on some coffee then crosses into the living room area.  Sitting there are piles of the files from work.  She pulls the top one out, copies the name and address onto an envelope stuffs the file and tape cassette in.  She pulls another file out.  This one has Joel's name on it.  She copies it onto an envelope. \nINT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nJoel says goodbye to Clementine. \nCLEMENTINE So you'll call me, right? \nJOEL Yeah. \nCLEMENTINE When? \nCLEMENTINE Joel, come here.  Please. \nHe hesitates then gingerly makes his way over to her.  She reaches for his hand and gently pulls him down.  He lies on his back beside her, their bodies touching.  He wants to turn to her, but out of shyness, doesn't.  She holds his hand. They look up at the stars.  She smiles, doesn't say anything and snuggles closer to him. \nJOEL Listen, did you want to make love? \nCLEMENTINE Make love? \nJOEL Have sex.  Y'know -- \nCLEMENTINE Oh, um... \nJOEL Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now. \nCLEMENTINE That's okay.  I -- \nJOEL I'm sorry.  I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and -- \nCLEMENTINE Hey, Joel -- \nJOEL -- and I'm just too nervous around you right now. \nCLEMENTINE I'm nervous, too. \nJOEL Yeah?  I wouldn't have thought that. \nCLEMENTINE Well, you obviously don't know me. \nJOEL I'm nervous because I have and enormous crush on you. \nShe smiles up at the sky. \nCLEMENTINE Show me which constellations you know. \nMONTAGE \nWe see people going to their mailboxes, finding manila envelopes.  One by one they open the envelopes and pull out tapes.  We see stunned, confused, disbelieving reactions as people listen to their tapes. \nEXT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - DAY \nJoel drops Clementine off.  She kisses him. \nINT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - A FEW MINUTES LATER \nJoel enters with his mail.  He opens a manila envelope, reads the enclosed file, sticks the cassette tape in his stereo, listens.  Joel dials the phone. \nCLEMENTINE'S VOICE Yeah? \nJOEL Did you send this?  Is it a joke? \nCLEMENTINE'S VOICE I probably got the same thing as you. \nJOEL I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you.  Who would even know to do this? \nCLEMENTINE'S VOICE (matter of fact) Maybe it's true then.  It's my voice on the tape. \nJOEL That's what you have to say?  How could it be true?  I never even heard of any procedure like this.  It's a joke. \nCLEMENTINE Maybe.  Call someone who'd know. \nMONTAGE \nWe see the people we saw opening envelopes, now on the phone. We hear over and over:  \"Is this true?\", \"Did this really happen?\", \"Do I know you?\", \"Is it true?\" \nINT. ROB AND CARRIE'S KITCHEN - DAY \nCarrie is on the phone.  She pauses nervously, then speaks: \nCARRIE Yes, Joel.  It is true.  We weren't supposed to say anything.  They say it's like waking a sleepwalker. \nINT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS \nJoel hangs up.  He dials the phone. \nJOEL It's true. \nCLEMENTINE'S VOICE I know.  I spoke to my friend Magda. \nJoel is immersed in the several page document. \nJOEL Look, I have to go.  I have to think. \nCLEMENTINE'S VOICE Joel, we've fucked.  We've made love. Like a million times.  And we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night.  Isn't that lovely? \nJoel doesn't know what to say as this registers.  He just stands there dumbly. \nCLEMENTINE'S VOICE (CONT'D) Come over here, sweetheart.  Please. \nJOEL You must have been crazy. \nCLEMENTINE'S VOICE Guess what I'm wearing. \nJOEL I don't know.  Panties and -- \nCLEMENTINE'S VOICE Your dried cum. \nJOEL Jesus. \nCLEMENTINE You're still excited by my irreverence. You haven't yet started to think of it as my \"gratuitous need to shock.\" \nJOEL I can't stop thinking about you. \nCLEMENTINE Yay.  Meet me after work by the old mill. \nJOEL What old mill?  Is that somewhere we -- \nCLEMENTINE I just wanted to say that.  Come by my house. \nINT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY \nMary opens the door.  Stan stands there with two cups of take out coffee. \nMARY Oh. \nSTAN Hi. \nMARY What do you want, Stan? \nSTAN Can I... I brought some -- \nShe steps aside for Stan to enter.  He does, looks around, sees the tapes and the stuffed envelopes on the floor. \nSTAN (CONT'D) What's this? \nMARY Nothing. \nSTAN I know what it is. \nMARY Then why did you ask me? \nSTAN I don't know.  I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office. \nMARY They have a right to know.  Howard is a thief.  He steals the truth. (suddenly weeping) I can't remember my baby!  I can't remember my baby.  It existed and I can't even remember.  Do you understand that? \nStan doesn't know what to say.  He stands there dumbly.  Mary slumps into a ball on a chair. \nSTAN Mary, people come to him voluntarily. \nMARY I won't allow it.  Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.  What do you think of that?  That's from my quote book. \nSTAN The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased. \nMARY (hysterically) Remember the Alamo!  Remember the Alamo! \nSTAN Mary... please.  This is hurting people. \nLong pause, then: \nMARY (small) I don't want to hurt people. (breaking down) But these things happened!  All these little sadnesses, the big ones.  What if no one remembers?  What does that do to the world? (beat, quietly) Someone has to remember, Stan. \nThey look at each other. \nEXT. PARK - AFTERNOON \nVague elliptical images of a young girl on a swig. \nSAD WOMAN'S VOICE I was by myself in the park because my friend Davia was sick that day.  I was on a swing.  There was this smiling man walking a little bushy dog -- \nVague shots of a man smiling, a scruffy dog on a leash. \nSAD WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D) The man said something like, \"He's friendly --\" \nVague shot of the man, his voice overlapping with the woman's. \nSAD WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D) \"-- he won't bite.\" \nMAN He won't bite.  You can pet him if you want... \nShot of the girl petting the dog. \nMAN Do you want to give him a biscuit? \nThe girl nods. \nMAN (CONT'D) They're in my car.  Why don't you -- \n", "test1_input": "JOEL See, I wouldn't think that about you. \nCLEMENTINE (pissy) Why wouldn't you think that about me? \nJOEL Oh.  I don't know.  I was just... I don't know.  I was... You seemed nice, so -- \nCLEMENTINE Now I'm nice?  Don't you know any other adjectives?  There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish. \nJOEL Well, anyway... Sorry. \nThey sit in silence for a while. \nCLEMENTINE I just don't think \"nice\" is a particularly interesting thing to be. \nThe conductor enters the car. \nCONDUCTOR Tickets. \nJoel hands the conductor his ticket.  The conductor punches it and hands it back. \nCLEMENTINE What is nice, anyway?  I mean, besides an adjective?  I guess it can be an adverb, sort of. \nThe conductor turns to Clementine.  She fishes in her bag. \nCLEMENTINE (CONT'D) It doesn't reveal anything.  Nice is pandering.  Cowardly. \nCLEMENTINE (CONT'D) And life is more interesting than that. Or should be.  Jesus God, I hope it is... someday. (to conductor) I know it's here. \nThe conductor and Joel watch as she gets more agitated. \nCLEMENTINE (CONT'D) I don't need nice.  I don't need myself to be it and I don't need anyone else to be it at me. \nJOEL Okay. \nCLEMENTINE Shit.  Shit.  I know it's here.  Hold on. \nShe dumps the contents of the bag onto the seat and sifts frantically through.  Joel sees the book she was reading in the diner.  It's The Play by Stephen Dixon. \nCLEMENTINE (CONT'D) Damn it.  DAMN IT! (there it is) Oh.  Here. \nShe hands the conductor the tickets, smiles sweetly.  He punches it, hands it back to her, and walks away. \nCONDUCTOR Next stop Southampton. \nThe conductor heads into the next car.  Clementine shoves stuff back into her purse.  Her hands are a little shaky. She pulls a airline-sized bottle of alcohol from her pocket, opens it, and downs it.  Joel is watching all of this but pretending not to.  She looks out the window for a while. The train pulls into the station.  The doors open.  Nobody gets on.  The doors close.  The train pulls out. \nCLEMENTINE Joel?  It's Joel, right? \nJOEL Yes? \nCLEMENTINE I'm sorry I... yelled at you.  Was it yelling?  I can't really tell.  Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today. \nJOEL That's okay. \nCLEMENTINE (stares out window) My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice.  Right now, anyway.  I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like.  But right now I'm glad you said, \"that's okay\" to me.  That was nice of you. \nJOEL It's no problem.  Anyway, I have some stuff I need to -- \nCLEMENTINE Oh, okay.  Well, sure, I'll just... (stands, throws bag over shoulder) Take care, then. \nJOEL (pulling journal from briefcase) Probably see you at the book store. \nCLEMENTINE (heading toward other end of car) Unless I get that hair-color-naming job. \nClementine sits and stares out the window. \nINT. TRAIN - LATER \nThere are a few more people in the car now.  Clementine has inched a few seats closer to Joel.  She watches him.  His head is immersed in his journal. \nINT. TRAIN - LATER \nIt's dark out.  The train is pretty crowded.  Joel stares out the window.  Clementine sits closer still to Joel, eyes him. \nEXT. TRAIN STATION - EVENING \nThe doors open and Joel emerges along with others.  He heads to the parking lot, arrives at the car.  There's a big dented scrape along the driver's side.  He gets in. \nINT. CAR - MOMENTS LATER \nJoel drives.  He passes Clementine walking.  She looks cold. He considers, slows, rolls down his window. \nJOEL Hi.  I could give you a ride if you need. \nCLEMENTINE No, that's okay.  Thanks, though. \nJOEL You're sure?  It's cold. \n", "test1_true": "JOEL It's okay. \nCLEMENTINE Yeah? \nHe pulls over.  She climbs in.  They drive. \nJOEL Where do you live? \nCLEMENTINE You're not a stalker or anything, right? \nJOEL Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no. \nCLEMENTINE You can't be too careful.  I've been stalked.  I've been told I'm highly stalkable.  I don't need that. \nJOEL I'm not a stalker. \nCLEMENTINE (beat) You know Wilmont? \nJOEL Yeah. \nCLEMENTINE Wilmont.  Near the high school. \nJoel turns.  They drive in silence. \nCLEMENTINE (CONT'D) Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort of nutso.  I'm not really. \nJOEL It's okay.  I didn't think you were. \nThere's a silence. \nCLEMENTINE So you like bookstores, huh? \nJOEL I like to read. \nCLEMENTINE Me too.  It is Rain Dogs, by the way. \nJOEL Yeah?  I can't remember that album very well.  I remember liking it.  But -- \nCLEMENTINE The song's 9th and Hennepin.  I spent most of the train ride trying to remember.  \"Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen.\"  Remember? \nJOEL Sort of, um... \nCLEMENTINE Remember?  \"And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat...\" (starts to cry) Oh, shit.  I'm so stupid.  Sorry. \nJOEL What? \nCLEMENTINE I'm just a bit of a wreck.  \"I sleep in your hat\" makes me cry. (pointing to a house) Me. \nJoel pulls over. \nCLEMENTINE (CONT'D) Thanks very much.  That was very nice of you. \nJOEL Well, I wouldn't want to be -- \nCLEMENTINE Oh, geez, I'm full of shit.  I already told you that. (pause) Anyway.  See Ya. \nClementine opens the car door. \nJOEL Take care. \nCLEMENTINE (turning back) Hey, do you want to have a drink?  I have lots of drinks.  And I could -- \nJOEL Um -- \nCLEMENTINE Never mind.  Sorry, that was stupid.  I'm embarrassed.  Good night, Joel. \nINT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - A FEW MINUTES LATER \nJoel stands in the living room, somewhat nervously.  He tries to calm himself by focusing on the surroundings.  He looks at the books on her shelves.  Clementine is in the kitchen.  We see her as she passes by the doorway several times, preparing drinks and chatting. \nCLEMENTINE Thanks.  I like it, too.  Been here about four years.  It's really cheap.  My downstairs neighbor is old so she's quiet, which is great.  And the landlord's sweet, which is bizarre, but great, and I have a little porch in the back, which is great, because I can read there, and listen to my crickets and... \nClementine is in the living room now with two gin and tonics. \nCLEMENTINE (CONT'D) Two blue ruins... \nJoel is looking at a framed black and white photograph of crows flying. \nCLEMENTINE (CONT'D) You like that? \nJOEL Very much. \nCLEMENTINE This... someone gave that to me, just like, recently.  I like it, too.  I like crows.  I think I used to be a crow. \nShe caws and hands Joel a drink. \nJOEL Thanks.  That was good, that crow sound. \n", "test1_id": 255, "test2_input": "CLEMENTINE Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation? \nJOEL I don't know. \nCLEMENTINE Me neither.  Oh, there's an inscription on the back. (takes it off the wall, reads:) The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued. \nJOEL Frost? \nCLEMENTINE (impressed) Yeah.  I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch.  His stuff seems strictly grade school to me.  But this made me cry for some reason.  Maybe because it is grade school.  Y'know? \nJOEL It's pretty. \nCLEMENTINE I miss grade school.  I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden.  When I went we called it elementary school.  But I like grade school better.  Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then.  Everyone wore hats.  Anyway, cheers! \nJOEL Cheers. \nThey click glasses.  Clementine giggles and takes a big gulp of her drink.  Joel sips.  She plops down on the couch and pulls her boots off. \nCLEMENTINE God, that feels so fucking good.  Take yours off. \nJOEL I'm fine. \nCLEMENTINE Yeah?  Well, have a seat, anyway. \nJoel sits in a chair across the room.  Clementine finishes her drink. \nCLEMENTINE (CONT'D) Ready for another? \nJOEL No, I'm okay for now. \nShe heads toward the kitchen with her glass. \nCLEMENTINE Well, I'm ready.  Put some music on. \nJoel crosses to the CD's and studies them. \nJOEL What do you want to hear? \nCLEMENTINE (O.S.) You pick it. \nJOEL You just say.  I'm not really -- \nCLEMENTINE (O.S.) I don't know!  I can't see them from here, Joel!  Just pick something good. \nJoel studies the unfamiliar CD's.  He picks up Bang On a Can performing Brian Eno's Music for Airports to look at. Clementine reenters with her drink. \nCLEMENTINE (CONT'D) Oh, excellent choice. \nShe grabs it and sticks it in the CD player.  The music is dreamy and haunting and slow.  Clementine falls back onto the couch, closes her eyes and sips her drink. \nCLEMENTINE (CONT'D) Mmmmmmm.  Way to go, Joel.  You pick good. \nJoel sits down in his chair and drinks.  There's a silence, which seems fine to Clementine but makes Joel anxious. \nJOEL Well, I should probably get going. \nCLEMENTINE No, stay.  Just for a little while. (opens her eyes, brightly) Refill? \nJOEL No.  I -- \nCLEMENTINE I know a man who needs a refill. \nShe grabs Joel's drink from his hand, takes it into the kitchen. \nCLEMENTINE (CONT'D) (O.S.) (CONT'D) God bless alcohol, is what I say.  Where would I be without it.  Oh, Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, maybe I don't want to think about that. \nShe giggles.  Joel looks around the room again.  There are several potatoes dressed as women in beautiful handmade costumes: a nurse potato, a stripper potato, a schoolteacher potato, a housewife potato.  Clementine returns with Joel's drink and a refill for herself. \nJOEL Thanks. \nCLEMENTINE Drink up, young man.  It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant. \nJoel looks a little alarmed. \nCLEMENTINE (CONT'D) I'm just kidding.  C'mon. \nShe sits back on the couch, closes her eyes.  Joel watches her, looks at her breasts.  She opens her eyes, smiles drunkenly at him. \nCLEMENTINE (CONT'D) Y'know, I'm sort of psychic. \nJOEL Yeah? \nCLEMENTINE Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic.  She should know. Do you believe in that stuff? \nJOEL I don't know. \nCLEMENTINE Me neither.  But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know.  Maybe that's just coincidence.  Right?  Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it?  Y'know? \n", "test2_true": "CLEMENTINE Exactly.  Exactly!  That's exactly my feeling about it.  It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen?  That's what you're saying, right?  You forget about those times.  Right? \nJOEL Yeah, I guess. \nCLEMENTINE (dreamy beat) But I think I am.  I like to think I am. \nCLEMENTINE (CONT'D) It's helpful to think there's some order to things.  You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you? \nJOEL Sorry.  My life isn't that interesting. I go to work.  I go home.  I don't know what to say. \nCLEMENTINE Oh. (considers this) Does that make you sad?  Or anxious?  I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know?  Taking advantage of every possibility?  Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have. \nJOEL I think about that. \nShe looks at him really hard for a long moment.  Joel tries to hold her gaze, but can't.  He looks down at his drink. Clementine starts to cry again. \nCLEMENTINE You're really nice.  I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it.  God, I'm an idiot. \nJOEL I do have a tendency to use that word too much. \nCLEMENTINE I like you.  That's the thing about my psychic thing.  I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people.  My problem is I never trust it.  But I get it.  And with you I get that you're a really good guy. \nJOEL Thanks. \nCLEMENTINE And, anyway, you sell yourself short.  I can tell.  There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain.  I can tell.  My goal... can I tell you my goal? \nJOEL Yeah. \nCLEMENTINE (ala Paul Simon) What's the goal, Joel? (laughs) My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me?  Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent.  Y'know? You love someone -- that's it.  Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do.  It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through.  And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing.  You know? \nJOEL Yeah.  I think so.  It's hard to -- \nCLEMENTINE Like I wanted to talk to you.  I didn't need any more reason to do it.  Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist? \nJOEL Yeah. \nCLEMENTINE You're very nice.  God, I have to stop saying that.  You're nervous around me, huh? \nJOEL No. \nCLEMENTINE I'm nervous.  You don't need to be nervous around me, though.  I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat? \nJOEL No, not at all. \nCLEMENTINE I don't either.  I used to.  But I'm through with that.  Y'know, if I don't love my body, then I'm just lost.  You know? \nCLEMENTINE (CONT'D) With all the wrinkles and scars and the general falling apart that's coming 'round the bend. (beat) So, I've been seeing this guy... \nJoel looks slightly crestfallen. \nCLEMENTINE (CONT'D) (off his reaction) Well, for the last week, anyway!  He's kind of a kid.  Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering.  Who wouldn't like that?  And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart.  He's the one who gave me that crow photograph. \nJOEL Oh, yeah. \nCLEMENTINE That made me cry.  But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River.  It gets frozen this time of year. \nJOEL That's scary sounding. \nCLEMENTINE Exactly!  I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know?  And that's where psychic stuff comes in.  Like, it just isn't right with him.  Y'know? \nJOEL I think so. \nCLEMENTINE I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things.  We like the same writers.  This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute.  It's fucked up.  Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime. \nJOEL Okay. \nCLEMENTINE Yeah?  Oh, great! \nShe sits closer to him. \nCLEMENTINE (CONT'D) I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and -- \nJOEL (shy) Sounds good.  But right now I should go. \nCLEMENTINE (pause) You should stay. \nJOEL I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so... \nCLEMENTINE (beat) Okay. \nJoel puts on his overcoat.  Clementine heads to the phone table, pulls out a notepad. \nCLEMENTINE (CONT'D) I would like you to call me.  Would you do that?  I would like that. \nJOEL Yes. \nShe scribbles her phone number, hands it to him.  He puts it in his pocket.  He stands there uncomfortably for a moment, then forces himself to speak. \n", "test2_id": 256, "test3_input": "Mary seems surprised, taken aback, caught.  She is silent for a long moment. \nMARY No. (beat) Besides, Howard's married, Stan.  He's a very serious and ethical man.  I'm not going to tempt him to betray all he believes in. \nStan takes another drag on the joint, passes it to Mary. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nPatrick, bundled up and carrying a full backpack, trudges through the snow. \nINT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS \nClementine watches out the window as Patrick nears.  She's crying.  He makes his way up her front stairs.  She swings open the door and hugs him. \nPATRICK Oh, baby, what's going on? \nCLEMENTINE I don't know.  I'm lost.  I'm scared.  I feel like I'm disappearing.  I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me. \nPATRICK Oh, Tangerine. \nCLEMENTINE Nothing makes any sense.  Nothing makes any sense. \nShe pushes herself out of the embrace and looks at Patrick. \nCLEMENTINE (CONT'D) Come up to Boston with me? \nPATRICK Sure.  We'll go next weekend and -- \nCLEMENTINE Now.  Now!  I have to go now.  I have to see the frozen Charles!  Now!  Tonight! \nPATRICK Um, okay.  I'll call my study partner. \nCLEMENTINE Yay!  It'll be great!  I'll get my shit. \nShe runs into the bedroom.  Patrick is at the phone and realizes he doesn't know Joel's number.  After a moment's thought, he *69's.  The phone rings. \nJOEL'S VOICE Hi, it's Joel.  Please leave a message after the beep. \nBeep. \nPATRICK (whisper) Stan, it's Patrick.  Pick up. \nSTAN'S VOICE Hey, where are you? \nPATRICK I got into a situation with the old lady. Can you handle things tonight alone?  I'm really sorry, man. \nINT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS \nStan is on the phone.  He's really stoned and watches Mary, stoned herself, dancing in a sexy trance to something soft and low on the stereo. \nSTAN I can handle it.  He's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway. \nINT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS \nPATRICK Thanks, Stan.  I owe you. \nPatrick hangs up, rifles quickly through his backpack.  He pulls out a silver bracelet, puts it in his pocket, then pulls out a journal, flips through it, keeping an eye on the bedroom door.  The handwriting is a woman's.  He finds what he's looking for.  He reads: \nCLEMENTINE'S VOICE I took Joel to walk on Charles River with me last night.  It was so beautiful and charming.  Joel was nervous about stepping onto the ice, but he wanted to please me so much -- he's so sweet -- that he came out after me.    We lay down right in the center and watched the stars.  He took my hand and said \"I could... \nEXT. CHARLES RIVER - NIGHT \nJoel and Clementine lie together holding hands on the frozen river.  They look up at the stars. \nJOEL ...die right now, Clem.  I'm just... happy.  I've never felt that before.  I'm just exactly where I want to be. \nClementine looks over at him.  Her eyes are filled with love and tears.  Then they get vague.  The scene is being erased. Joel is panicked. \nJOEL (CONT'D) Clem, no!  This can't keep happening. Please!  Oh, fuck!  Please! \nCrazily, Joel runs off, passing through a series of decayed scenes: He and Clementine arguing in a car, having sex on the beach, laughing and holding hands at a movie, eating grilled cheese and tomato soup together in bed, Joel watching her sleep, them drinking at a bar.  He arrives at a decayed version of his first meeting with Mierzwiak. \nMIERZWIAK We can help you through this.  Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about -- \nJOEL You have to stop this! \nMIERZWIAK What?  What do you mean? \nJOEL I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased!  Stop it now! \nMIERZWIAK Yes, but... I'm just something you're imagining.  What can I do?  I'm in your head, too. \nINT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nPatrick reads the journal. \nCLEMENTINE'S VOICE ... and we made love right on the ice. It was absolutely freezing on my ass!  It was wonderful. \n", "test3_true": "CLEMENTINE I'm so excited.  Yay! \nPATRICK I'm excited, too.  Oh, and I wanted to give you this.  It's a little... thing. \nPatrick pulls the bracelet from his pocket, hands it to her. \nPATRICK (CONT'D) I didn't have a chance to wrap it. \nCLEMENTINE It's gorgeous. (slipping it on) Just my taste.  I've never  gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry I liked. (kisses him) Thanks.  So let's get going.  Long drive. \nINT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nStan and Mary have sex on the floor next to Joel's bed. \nEXT. FOREST - DAY \nJoel and Clementine are hiking, Clementine in front. \nCLEMENTINE Such a beautiful view. \nJOEL (looking at her) Yes indeed. (snapping out of memory) Fuck!  They're erasing you, Clem! \nCLEMENTINE Oh? \nJOEL I hired them to.  We're in my brain.  But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore. \nCLEMENTINE Wow.  Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake? \nJOEL I don't know. \nHe concentrates.  Nothing happens. \nJOEL (CONT'D) Aaargh!  It's horrible!  I'm trapped! \nHe starts to have a fit, banging against trees, stomping his feet, screaming.  But even while he's doing this the memory and Clementine are fading around him. \nINT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - DAY \nIt's raining out.  Joel is reading, slouched in a chair.  He looks over at Clementine, stretched out on her belly in her underwear.  She's reading, too. \nVOICE-OVER She's so sexy. \nJOEL I loved you on this day.  I love this memory.  The rain.  Us just hanging. \nClementine looks over at him, smiles.  Her brow furrows in thought. \nCLEMENTINE What if you hide me? \nJOEL What do you mean? \nCLEMENTINE (formulating) Well... if they're looking for me in memories I'm in, what if you take me to a memory I'm not in? (proud) And we can hide there till morning. \nJoel ponders this.  The scene and Clementine are beginning to dissolve.  Joel grabs Clementine's hand.  She giggles with glee.  He pulls her out of the scene as it degrades. \nJOEL Where?  Where?  Where? \nHe drags her through the landscape of already decayed memories and turns off into: \nINT. KITCHEN - DAY \nThe kitchen is dated and vague.  Joel and Clementine are in an oversized playpen; they're adults but small.  Joel wears footsie pajamas with some vague little animals on them.  He holds a a red furry huckleberry hound doll.  Clementine is still in her panties and bra.  An oversized woman in high heels, seen from a low angle, hurries back and forth preparing dinner. \nCLEMENTINE Jesus.  What's this? \nJoel looks around at the kitchen, at his doll, at the woman. \nJOEL I must be about two. (oddly) I want my mommy.  She's busy.  She's not looking at me. (back to himself, re: doll) Look, my Huckleberry Hound doll!  I told you about this! (beat) I want my mommy! \nHe starts to cry.  Clementine tries to comfort him.  She hugs him. \nJOEL (CONT'D) (crying still) I want my mommy. (adult, to Clementine) I don't want to lose you, Clem. \nCLEMENTINE I'm right here. \nJOEL I'm scared.  I want my mommy.  I don't want to lose you.  I don't want to lose... \nCLEMENTINE Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading. The memory.  I think we're hidden. \nJoel sucks in some snot.  His mother scurries back and forth clanging pots.  The room is not decaying.  Joel smiles. \nINT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nStan and Mary lie on the floor, their stoned minds wandering after sex.  Stan suddenly perks up.  He looks at the monitor. \nSTAN It's stopped. \nMARY What? \n", "test3_id": 257}

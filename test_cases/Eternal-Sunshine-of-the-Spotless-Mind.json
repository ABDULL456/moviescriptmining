{"test1_input": "JOEL (CONT'D) I don't think your personality comes out of a tube.  I think the hair is just... a pretty topping. \nShe tears up, swallows, and kisses him on the cheek.  He's surprised and pleased and nervous. \nJOEL (CONT'D) (shyly formal) So, I enjoyed meeting you. \nCLEMENTINE You'll call me, right? \nJOEL Yeah. \nCLEMENTINE When? \nJOEL Tomorrow? \nCLEMENTINE Tonight.  Just to test out the phone lines and all. \nJOEL Okay. \nWe stay with Clementine as she watches Joel tromping through the snow and getting in his car. \nINT. JOEL'S CAR - NIGHT \nJoel speeds through the suburban Rockville Center neighborhood.  There is no snow on the ground.  He seems different, somehow foggy and disoriented. \nSUBTITLE:  THREE DAYS EARLIER \nHe arrives at his apartment building and parks. \nEXT. JOEL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS \nJoel gets out of his car, spots a van parked across the street.  There are two dark figures inside. \nVOICE-OVER Them. \nHe hurries inside the building. \nINT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nJoel enters, dumps his overcoat on a chair, turns off the lights, crosses to look furtively out the window.  It's snowing in large flakes which seem to fall only in the beam of a streetlight. \nJOEL It was snowing. \nVOICE-OVER There are two of them.  Couldn't make them out.  The orange glow of a cigarette. \nJoel squints to see inside the van.  Two dark figures talk. One sucks on a cigarette and s dim orange light momentarily illuminates the interior.  The figure in the driver seat rolls down his window and gives a cheery wave to Joel. \nJOEL The driver waved.  So casual, friendly. \nVOICE-OVER I'm like a joke to them. \nJoel pulls away from the window, his face blanched. \nVOICE-OVER I guess they figure they can act like they want.  They don't have to worry about me remembering. \nHe paces, mulling things over.  As he does, the scene starts to change, almost as if it is drying out. \nJOEL I might be making a mistake. \nVOICE-OVER Maybe I'm making a mistake.  Maybe I just need to learn to live with this.  First of all, I'll get over it.  Secondly, it happened.  Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it.  Who said that?  Churchill?  I'm not sure. But I don't care.  She did it to me.  I have to rid myself of this.  Fuck her. \nJOEL Fuck you, Clementine. \nThe colors bleach, the surroundings become slightly vague. Even Joel's persona and voice-over seem to alter, his emotional intensity becoming diffused.  Joel does not seem aware of this.  He stops pacing, takes a small vial from his pocket, dumps the lone pill onto his palm.  He looks at it. It's pink.  There's some illegible initials stamped on it. \nJOEL (CONT'D) Pink. (beat) There was a number on it.  I remember. AL 1718? (beat) I have to follow through with this.  I have no choice. \nVOICE-OVER The pill was pink, I remember.  It had some letters and numbers on it.  What were they?  AL 1718?  AL something.  Four digits.  I don't like taking pills when I don't know what they are.  I have no choice. \nHe swallows it, peeks out the window again, takes off his clothes, slips into a pair of pajamas fresh from the store packaging.  He sits on the edge of the bed, dials the phone. \nJOEL (CONT'D) We're sorry, the number you have dialed... (beat) Screw you, Clementine, for doing this ... \nRECORDED VOICE We're sorry, the number you have dialed is no longer in service.  If you think you have reached this recording in error \nJOEL (CONT'D) Bye. \nJoel hangs up and lies on his back on the bed.  By now the scene is lifeless, almost a husk.  He hears the apartment building door open.  He hears footsteps. \nJOEL (CONT'D) It's them. \nVOICE-OVER It's too late. \nHis eyelids are getting heavy.  He closes his eyes. \nBLACK. \nHe hears a key in his apartment door. \n", "test1_true": "INT. BOOKSTORE - NIGHT \nJoel sits in the bookstore coffee shop.  It's a jarring transition, visually and emotionally.  Joel is in the midst of some traumatic state of mind. He fingers the vial with the pink pill in it as he watches Clementine stack books on shelves.  Her hair is bright orange now. \nJOEL I should maybe talk to you. \nVOICE-OVER Clementine.  I should just maybe talk to her. \nJoel rises and heads toward Clementine. \nJOEL I love you and if you knew that... if I told you what happened...  I'll explain everything, what we meant to each other. I'll tell you everything about our time together.  You'll know everything again and... \nVOICE-OVER Maybe if I just explain what happened, I wouldn't have to go through this and I could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and... \nRight before Joel gets there, Patrick, a skinny young man approaches Clementine.  Joel stops, watches.  The young man seems out of breath.  He glances over at Joel, then taps Clementine on the shoulder.  She turns, annoyed, sees who it is and her face lights up. \nJOEL Clementine. \nVOICE-OVER That's your look for me. \nClementine giggles, stands and pokes Patrick playfully in the ribs. \nPATRICK I just thought I'd say hi.  I was in the neighborhood. \nCLEMENTINE You were not. \nPATRICK I was not. \nJoel is mesmerized by their familiarity.  As he stands there, the scene starts to dry out. Clementine and Patrick continue their flirtation but it's turning lifeless, as if they are just reciting lines.  The bookstore start to lose its color and immediacy. \nCLEMENTINE Come over after I'm done here? \nPATRICK I can't.  I want to, but I have to study. \nCLEMENTINE You rat. \nPATRICK I really want to, but tonight's important.  Test tomorrow. \nJOEL How could she have done this to me?  How could anyone do this to anyone? \nCLEMENTINE (to Patrick) You didn't say anything about my hair. \nPATRICK It's so cool.  You're by far the most sensational person in the room. \nCLEMENTINE In the room? \nPATRICK In the world. \nJoel seems dazed, in some sort of dream confusion, as he realizes the world around him is looking increasingly odd. \nJOEL What's happening here? (looks at watch; it's 9:30) Oh, God!  I have to go home.  They'll be there soon. \nJoel turns to leave. \nINT. JOEL'S CAR - NIGHT \nJoel drives fast, recklessly.  The intensity is back.  He's weeping as he drives. \nJOEL Gotta get home.  How could she do this to me? How could she not care about what we meant to each other.  What a fuck!  What a fucking monster she is! \nVOICE-OVER Oh, God.  I miss her.  I can't believe she's with that guy now!  I'm never going to see her again.  I love her so much. What a fucking monster she is! \nThe scene is faded as he parks in front of his apartment building, and gets out of the car.  Joel spots the parked van.  We've seen this before, but it's dried out now. \nJOEL Them. \nEXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY \nJoel trudges along carrying two big trash bags full of stuff. He's been crying.  He looks behind him and finds himself looking out the window of his apartment at the dark van on the snowy street.  He turns back to the New York Street and spots the address he was looking for: 610 11th Avenue. \nINT. WAITING ROOM - DAY \nJoel sits in the small room with his bags.  A woman across from him cradles a box full of belongings in her lap.  Her eyes are red from crying.  Mary, the receptionist, pokes her head through her window into the waiting room. \nMARY Hello again, Mr. Barish.  Good, you've got your stuff. \nINT. HALLWAY - DAY \nJoel walks with his bags behind Mary. \nMARY (not looking back) How are you today? (at lab) Here we are. \nINT. LABORATORY - DAY \nJoel enters.  Mierzwiak stands there with Stan in his lab coat. \nMIERZWIAK Ah, Mr. Barish.  This is Stan.  He'll be in charge of your procedure tonight. \n", "test1_id": 255, "test2_input": "The scene poops out of existence with a flash of light. \nINT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nJoel finds himself eating Chinese food and sitting across from Clementine.  He is ragged and jarred. \nJOEL I'm done, Clem.  I'm just going to ride it out.  Hiding is clearly not working. \nCLEMENTINE Yeah. \nJOEL I want to enjoy my little time left with you. \nCLEMENTINE This is our first \"date\" date. \nJOEL Do you remember what we talked about? \nCLEMENTINE Naomi, I guess. \nJOEL Yeah. \nCLEMENTINE What was I wearing? \nJOEL God, I should know.  Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper. \nCLEMENTINE Egad, were you horrified? \nJOEL No!  I think you were wearing that black dress, y'know, with the buttons. \nShe is wearing the black dress. \nCLEMENTINE No, you were with me when I bought that. At that place on East 6th.  It was later. \nINT. DRESS SHOP - SHOP \nThe scene has already been erased.  It's just a decayed husk. A vague Joel watches a vague Clementine model a black dress. \nINT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nClementine wears a generic black dress now. \nJOEL Right.  Something black though. \nCLEMENTINE I'll buy that.  Black's always good. \nJOEL We did talk about Naomi. \nCLEMENTINE I said: Are you sure?  You seem unsure. \nJOEL I'm sure, I said. \nCLEMENTINE But you weren't.  I could tell. \nJOEL I was so nervous.  I remember I couldn't think of anything to say.  There were long silences. \nThere is a long silence. \nJOEL (CONT'D) I thought I was foolish.  I thought I'd mistaken infatuation for love.  You said: \nCLEMENTINE So what.  Infatuation is good, too. \nJOEL And I didn't have an argument. \nINT. CAR - NIGHT \nJoel and Clementine pull up to Clementine's house. \nJOEL I dropped you off after.  You said -- \nCLEMENTINE (Mae West) Come up and see me... now. \nJOEL It's very late. \nCLEMENTINE Yes, exactly.  Exactly my point. \nINT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nJoel and Clementine are in the midst of awkward shy sex. \nJOEL This was our first time. \nThe scene starts to fade.  Joel watches Clementine disappear. \nINT. LACUNA RECEPTION AREA - NIGHT \nMary enters the dark room, frazzled.  She flips on the fluorescent lights and searches the file folders, finds one with her name on it.  Her jaw drops.  With a shaky hand, she puts the tape into the player on her desk and presses \"play.\" \nMIERZWIAK VOICE Okay, so just tell me what you remember. And we'll take it from there. \n", "test2_true": "MIERZWIAK VOICE It's what's best, Mary.  You know that. \nMary slumps to the floor.  We move into her eyes. \nMARY'S VOICE Yeah, I know.  Oh, God.

NO DETAIL. \nA flirtatious look from Mierzwiak. \nMARY'S VOICE (CONT'D) ...Remember you bought me that little wind-up frog? \nA vague shot of a wind-up frog. \nMARY'S VOICE (CONT'D) And you said... \nA vague shot of Mierzwiak mouthing to Mary's voice. \nMARY'S VOICE (CONT'D) \"This is for your desk.  Just a little token\" \nBack to Mary sitting on the floor, listening to the tape. \nMARY'S VOICE (CONT'D) I knew then... I knew something was going to happen... something wonderful. \nINT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nJoel sits in the quiet living room.  The scene is fading. \nJOEL Naomi. \nVOICE-OVER On the couch.  Dark.  Quiet.  I wondered if I had made a terrible mistake.  I almost reached for the phone about a thousand times.  I thought I could take it back, erase it, explain I had momentarily lost my mind. Then I told myself we weren't happy.  That was the truth.  That what we were was safe. It was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason.  I thought about Clementine and the spark when I was with her, but then I thought what you and I had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it wasn't much fun.   But I wanted fun.  I saw other people having fun and I wanted it. Then I thought fun is a lie, that no one is really having fun; I'm being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit... then I thought maybe not, maybe not.  And then I thought, as I always do at this point in my argument, about dying. \nINT. ROOM - DAY \nAn elderly man sits. \nVOICE-OVER I projected myself to the end of my life in some vague rendition of my old man self.  I imagined looking back with a tremendous hole of regret in my heart. \nINT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nJoel sits. \nVOICE-OVER I didn't pick up the phone to call you, Naomi.  I didn't pick up the phone. \nThe scene dissolves. \nINT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - DAY \nNamoi is red-eyed from crying.  She is packing things in boxes.  Joel paces, steals glances at her, doesn't know what to say.  She holds up a book.  The scene starts to fade. \nNAOMI Yours? \nJOEL You take it.  I don't know. \nShe tosses it in a box. \nJOEL (CONT'D) Naomi, I really value our relationship. I hope it's possible for us to stay in touch. \nNAOMI Don't do this to me now, Joel.  Really. \nINT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - DAY \nJoel watches out the window as Naomi stuffs a final box in the trunk of a car.  There's another woman down there with her.  They get into the car and drive off. \nINT. BORDER'S BOOKSTORE - NIGHT \nJoel talks to Clementine.  The scene is fogging over. \nJOEL I told her today I need to end it. \nCLEMENTINE Is that what you want? \nJOEL I did it.  I guess that means something. \nClementine shrugs.  The scene fades. \nEXT. PARK - DAY \nJoel walks with Naomi. \nNAOMI So what's going on, Joel? \nJOEL I don't know, I've just been thinking, maybe we're not happy with each other. \nNAOMI What? \nJOEL Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and -- \n", "test2_id": 256, "test3_input": "She finds a window that's unlatched.  She lifts it. \nCLEMENTINE (CONT'D) Cool. \nJOEL What are you doing? \nCLEMENTINE It's freezing out here. \nShe scrambles in the window.

I was paralyzed with fear. \nThe front door opens and Clementine stands there beckoning. \nCLEMENTINE (CONT'D) C'mon, man.  The water's fine.  Nobody's coming here tonight, believe me.  This place is closed up.  Electricity's off. \nJOEL I hesitated for what seemed like forever. \nCLEMENTINE I could see you wanted to come in, Joel. \nHe walks cautiously toward the door. \nCLEMENTINE (CONT'D) As soon as you walked in.  I knew I had you.  You knew I knew that, right? \nINT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nJoel enters the darkened and Clementine closes the door behind him. \nJOEL I knew. \nCLEMENTINE I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass. \nJOEL It's dark. \nCLEMENTINE Yeah.  What's your girlfriend's name? \nJOEL Naomi. \nShe's searching through drawers for something.  She pulls out a flashlight, shines it in Joel's face. \nCLEMENTINE Ah-ha!  Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet. \nJOEL I think we should go. \nCLEMENTINE No, it's our house!  Just tonight -- (looking at envelope on counter) -- we're David and Ruth Laskin.  Which one do you want to be?  I prefer to be Ruth but I'm flexible. (opens cabinet) Alcohol!  You make drinks.  I'm going find the bedroom and slip into something more Ruth.  I'm ruthless at the moment. \nShe runs upstairs, giggling.  The room is drying out, turning into a husk. \nJOEL (calling after her) I really should go.  I really need to catch my ride. \nVOICE-OVER I didn't want to go.  I was too nervous. I thought, maybe you were a nut.  But you were exciting.  You called from upstairs. \nCLEMENTINE (CONT'D) (flat) So go. \nJOEL I did.  I walked out the door.  I felt like I was a scared little kid.  I thought you knew that about me.  I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation.  You said, \"so go\" with such disdain. \nCLEMENTINE (CONT'D) (poking her head downstairs) What if you stay this time? \nJOEL I walked out the door.  There's no more memory. \nCLEMENTINE Come back and make up a good-bye at least.  Let's pretend we had one. \nClementine comes downstairs, vague and robotic, making her way through the decaying environment. \nCLEMENTINE (CONT'D) Bye, Joel. \nJOEL I love you. \nShe smiles.  They kiss.  It fades. \nCLEMENTINE I -- \nEXT. BEACH - NIGHT \nJoel finds himself hurrying back to the bonfire.  This scene, too, is disintegrating.  It dries up and Joel is just standing there on a faded beach at night, the bonfire frozen in the distance like a photograph. \nINT. CAR - NIGHT \nJoel sits in the back seat, Rob and Carrie are in the front. \nCARRIE Did you have fun? \nJoel nods glumly. \nCarrie continues to talk, but her voice goes under as Joel studies the faded husks of memories, piled like refuse outside the moving car window.  He sees dried-out version of previous interactions with Clementine playing out in loops. He looks back and sees the memory of his ride home from the beach with Rob and Carrie.  It, too, is decaying.  Soon all has crumbled into dust.  Everything goes black. \n", "test3_true": "Howard watches the monitor.  The last specks of light are fading.  It grows dark.  He is tired, his eyes are hollow.

He and Howard look at each other. \nSTAN So, I've got to drop the van off. \nMIERZWIAK Thanks, Stan.  Thanks. \nINT. PATRICK'S CAR - EARLY MORNING \nPatrick and Mary are heading home from Boston.  Mary is silent and depressed.  Patrick tries to break the silence. \nPATRICK You want to stop for coffee or something? \nMary shakes her head \"no.\"  Long silence. \nPATRICK (CONT'D) Well, it was sure beautiful on that river.  Thanks for sharing it with me. \nMary doesn't say anything.  Silence. \nPATRICK (CONT'D) Well do it again soon. \nEXT. PARKING STRUCTURE - EARLY MORNING \nStan pulls the van into space marked \"Lacuna.\"  He gets out, crosses to his car.  Mary is sitting on the hood. \nSTAN Hey. \nMARY (beat) Do you swear you didn't know? \nSTAN I swear. \nMARY And you never even suspected?  Never saw us behaving in any unusual way together? \nSTAN Once, maybe. \nShe watches him closely, waiting for him to continue. \nSTAN (CONT'D) It was here.  At his car.  I was coming back from a job and spotted you together. You seemed caught.  I waved.  You giggled. \nMARY How did I look? \nSTAN (beat) Happy.  Happy with a secret. \nMary starts to cry. \nMARY And after that? \nSTAN I never saw you together like that again. So I figured I was imagining things. \nMary says nothing. \nSTAN (CONT'D) I really like you, Mary.  You know that. \nMARY Do you remember anything else?  What I was wearing?  Was I standing close to him?  Was I leaning against his car like I owned it?  How did he look at me when I giggled?  Tell me everything. \nSTAN (thinking) You were in red.  That red sweater with the little flowers, I think.  You were leaning against his car. (thinking) He looked a little like a kid.  Kind of goofy and wide-eyed.  I'd never seen him look like that before.  Happy.  You looked beautiful.  You looked in love. \nMARY (heading toward the levator) Thanks, Stan. \nShe stops but doesn't turn to face him. \nMARY (CONT'D) You're nice. (beat) But I love him.  I knew I loved him.

BACK ON YORGI AND XANDER 
Yorgi looks up at a "PRAGUE PEACE CONFERENCE" banner. 
YORGI Next week these idiots are having a peace conference here. What the hell are they going to talk about? It's the system itself that causes all the world's problems. You're okay, buddy. Come on, it's getting early. 
They stroll off and Kirill stands down. 
EXT. PRAGUE STREETS - SUNRISE 
A flotilla of VEHICLES (Xander's GTO among them) drives through the gate in a massive, stone wall. It's a big manor house in the middle of town. 
INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - COURTYARD - PRAGUE - SUNRISE 
The GTO, sedans, SUV's park in the courtyard. Xander sees a row of MOTORCYCLES parked here as well. 
Xander also sees a Guard hit a switch that LOWERS the HEAVY WOODEN GATE. 
Yorgi corrals a bunch of STRIPPERS he's brought home. 
YORGI This way, girls, let's go! 
He leads the whole troop inside. 
INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - HALLWAY - SUNRISE 
As they go down the hall/Xander sees ROOMS FULL OF OFFICE WORKERS and MAFIYA GOONS. 
VIKTOR Diversified global operations. The sun never sets on our empire. 
Xander takes in WORLD MAPS, FAX MACHINES, BANKS OF COMPUTERS. 
For all their screwing around, it's clear Anarchy 99 runs a large operation. 
INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - MAIN HALL - SUNRISE 
With leaded glass windows overlooking the river, this place is beautiful. Inside it's done up more like the house from MTV's "Real World", except trashed. There's cool fish tanks, a pool table, PS2 on a flatscreen and spray paint and holes all over the walls. 
SERVANTS welcome them with food and Yorgi's SECRETARY gives him important messages. 
YORGI (sorting through messages) Not bad, yes? The original owners, they just one day decide to move out. 
Anders starts pounding on a drumset. Petra kicks a soccer ball at him. 
PETRA Yeb vas, z'opa. Shut up! 
Yorgi paws at a Stripper. 
YORGI I've got meetings this afternoon, I've got to get some sleep. Just pick a girl. 
XANDER That's alright, I'm kinda tired. 
YORGI You want to insult me? This is my hospitality. Pick one. 
Xander points at one of the Strippers. She's wearing a fashionable FLAK JACKET. 
YORGI Good, now find a room to crash in. 
Petra, show him. 
The surly Petra opens a door, revealing a hall of doors. 
Xander and Flak Jacket follow. 
XANDER You gonna tuck us in? 
She just gives him a nasty look, walks into her room and slams the door. Xander scratches his head and picks a room. 
The others shuffle off to their beds with their Strippers. 
INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - XANDER'S ROOM - SUNRISE 
Flak Jacket is out of sight in the bathroom. Xander talks to her while he gets undressed. 
XANDER Listen, no offense, but I'm not in the market right now, okay? You can stay here, but let's not -- 
He trails off as she steps out of the bathroom. She's wearing just a G-string and the flak jacket. 
XANDER You don't understand a word I'm saying, do you? 
She just smiles at him sweetly and pulls his shirt off. She looks at the ENGAGEMENT RING still pierced through his nipple and gives a puzzled look. 
XANDER Stupid, right? That's what I was trying to tell you. I just got out of this heavy thing... 
She kisses him and lets the flak jacket fall (PG-13 style).

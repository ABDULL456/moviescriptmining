{"train": "SAVE THE LAST DANCE \nby \nDuane G. Adler \nrevisions by \nToni-Ann Johnson \nCurrent Revisions by \nCheryl Edwards (6/11/99) \nREWRITE -- FIRST SET OF REVISIONS \nCort/Madden Company Paramount Studios 5555 Melrose Avenue Chevalier Building, Ste. 203 Los Angeles, California \nJUNE 11, 1999 \nFADE IN: \n1   EXT. PENNSYLVANIA COUNTRYSIDE - LONG SHOT - DAY            1 \nof an empty stretch of land parted down the middle by railroad tracks. An Amtrak Commuter crests the horizon, heads TOWARD us. As it gets CLOSER, we GO IN TIGHTER to see -- \n2   FACE OF SARA JOHNSON                                       2 \n17, pressed at one of its windows. \n3   REVERSE ANGLE - REFLECTION IN TRAIN'S WINDOW -             3 SARA'S FACE \ndistant and lovely and sad. SUPERIMPOSED against an endless stream of sky and trees. The train speeds up and SARA's face flies by, disappearing FROM FRAME. \n4   INT. AMTRAK TRAIN - MOVING - DUSK                          4 \nA zaftig BLACK WOMAN clumsily negotiates the aisle. Stops at the first of a few empty seats left in the car. \nWOMAN This seat taken? \nANGLE ON SARA \nlooking up, around. She shakes her head, clears her backpack and magazines from the seat beside her. The Woman drops down, settles in. A long silence. The Woman glances at the American Ballet magazine on Sara's lap. Tries to make conversation. \nWOMAN I love ballet. Never had the body for it. Do you dance? \nSara folds her arms, turns away mumbling under breath. \nSARA Used to. \nSara gazes out the window. The world outside begins to dissolve melting into images from another time, another place. Her eyes stare blankly OUT AT us, blinded by her memories. \n5   FLASHBACK - INT. AUDITORIUM - KINDERGARTEN RECITAL - DAY 5 \nA stage full of five-year-olds in tights and tutus. A little girl performs center stage. She's remarkably poised, remarkably good. CAMERA PANS TO the audience. A woman in an Irish clover necklace springs to her feet clapping loudly. The little girl's eyes catch the glint of the necklace's gold. Mommy. She flashes a megawatt smile, ends the dance with an unscripted bow, as we... \nDISSOLVE TO: \n6   INT. BALLET CLASS - EVENING (FIVE YEARS LATER)                6 \nYoung Sara, lithe and earnest, dances. A budding beauty blessed with long limbs and natural grace, she makes it look easy. Gliding past the envious stares of classmates, she scans the hall for a glint of gold. Finds it in the back of the room where her mother, Glynn, stands watching her. Their eyes connect with mutual smiles and those smiles CARRY us TO: \n7   INT. SARA'S EXETER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                  7 \nA pair of flexing feet in ballet slippers on a hardwood floor. PAN UP and PULL BACK to reveal Sara at 17, dancing in the space opened up by cornered furniture and rolled up rugs. As Glynn looks on, Sara completes the routine with a pirouette. She spins out of it with a preoccupied frown on her face. \nGLYNN What's the matter?   It was good. \nSARA (checks her stance in mirror) Everybody there's going to be good, Mom. I have to be better. (then, beginning again) My knees still knock when I do my free form. Did you notice that? \nGLYNN I noticed that it was fine. \nSARA (escalating frustration) It's not supposed to be fine. It's supposed to be special. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n7   CONTINUED:                                                     7 \nSARA (CONT'D) And it just lays there, it doesn't do anything. I bet they notice that. That it doesn't do anything. That I don't do anything special enough to get in. \nGLYNN Sara.   You'll get in. \nSARA Don't lie because you love me.     My free form sucks. \nGLYNN (giving up that battle) I've got something for you. Come on. Sit. Mouth closed, eyes shut. No pouting. No peeking. \n14   FLASHBACK - INT. UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA - WAITING        14 ROOM - DAY \nSara, in costume, flips through a magazine. She taps her toes, checks her watch. A phalanx of parents and dancers are clustered around a sign posted on the door: JUILLIARD SCHOOL OF DANCE AUDITIONS. Sara stares at it. Re-checks her watch. An official with a clipboard walks toward her. Where's her mother? \n15   INT. UNIV. OF PENNSYLVANIA - STAGE/AUDITORIUM -              15 MOMENTS LATER \nSara on stage. She looks past a row of Juilliard JUDGES into the audience. No glint of gold. MOZART'S \"Elvira Madigan\" (Andante) CUES UP. Sara begins her technical. She transforms her nervousness into a notable, powerful performance. The Judges are mutely but clearly impressed. One of them looks directly at her. \n(CONTINUED) \n15   CONTINUED:                                                  15 \nJUDGE Is there anything you'd like to share about your free form before you begin? A motif... a theme? \nSara's stomach drops to her feet. Her mother's not there and her free form sucks and she doesn't have a theme. Shit! \nSARA Well, it's um, pretty self- explanatory. The theme. \nThe Judges exchange a look. New MUSIC CUES UP. Some driving, CLASSICAL NUMBER.   Sara tries to elevate her body above the music, but she's nervous, unsure on her feet. She keeps glancing in the back of the auditorium for Glynn. Searching for her port in the storm. Wondering where her mother is and knowing how badly she's dancing. Knowing but somehow continuing, stumbling, recovering, and finally finishing with those damned knocking knees. The Judges, eyes like stones, perfunctorily nod. Their equivalent of maybe next year. Sara chokes two words out... \nSARA Thank you. \n16   INT. AUDITORIUM - BACKSTAGE \n... Rushes backstage. Fighting tears, she hurries past waiting dancers angrily unhooking the clover leaf chain from her neck. \n17   INT. DRESSING ROOM - DAY                                    17 \nSara in street clothes. Cramming her ballet gear into a duffle bag when the official (of the clipboard) approaches her. She touches Sara's shoulder gently. Says something we do not hear. \n18   INT. OFFICE (UNIV. OF PA) - CONTINUOUS ACTION               18 \nSHOOTING THROUGH office window. A state trooper in a rain slicker offers Sara a chair. She sits. The trooper talks. As he does, dread and disbelief spread over Sara's face. She shakes her head, attempts to stand. Her legs buckle beneath her. The trooper and the official catch her as she falls. \n19   EXT. AMTRAK TRAIN - NIGHT (PRESENT)                         19 \nA glowing moon in a clear, star-specked sky. \n20   TRAIN                                                      20 \nCHUGS toward Baltimore's Penn Station, which is visible in the f.g. \n21   EXT. PENNSYLVANIA TURNPIKE - INTERCUT - MORNING             21 \nA torrential rain. A flower van -- Glynn's van -- caught in it. SHOOTING THROUGH the driver's side window, we can see Glynn's face, intense and determined, squinting through the downpour. \n22   TRAIN'S WHEELS                                              22 \nGRINDING. \n23   VAN'S WHEELS                                                23 \nHydro-planing, slip-sliding. \n24   TRAIN                                                       24 \nIt's SQUEAL OF BRAKES as it maneuvers into the station. \n25   VAN                                                         25 \nThe SQUEAL of its BRAKES as Glynn loses control and smashes into the back of the eighteen wheeler in front of her. \n26   TRAIN                                                       26 \nacross space and time, the SOUND OF SQUEALING BRAKES commingle as the Amtrak Commuter pulls into Penn Station. \n27   INT. AMTRAK TRAIN - NIGHT                                   27 \nSara. Holding her breath, clenching her fists. Waiting for the sound to stop, oblivious to the stare of the Woman beside her. \n28   EXT. PENN STATION (BALTIMORE) - PLATFORM - NIGHT            28 \nROY JOHNSON, 37, a handsome, laconic man of uncertain style, takes a last drag from his cigarette, drops and stomps it. Passengers disembark from the train. Roy searches their faces. They all look like strangers. \n29   EXT. AMTRAK TRAIN - SAME TIME                               29 \nA conductor helps Sara to the platform. Steam from the train's engine is sucked into the fog. She walks through it. Sees him. They see each other. Roy weakly waves. Walks toward her. Sara watches his bow legs stiffly advance. She wants to run. Can't. \nROY Hi. \nSARA Hi. \nROY Have a good ride? \nSara self-consciously tucks her hair behind an ear. \nSara lying in bed... wide awake... her stiff upper lip quivering. She slips out of bed, creeps on tiptoes into the bathroom. Closes the door oh-so-quietly behind her. She flips on the light, crosses to the sink, turns on both faucets. As the water flows and the PIPES RATTLE, the brick wall shatters. Sara crumbles to the floor. Buries her head in her arms. Cries like a baby. \n35   INT./EXT. ROY'S PICKUP (SOUTH BALTIMORE) -                     35 NEXT MORNING \nRoy and Sara. Barreling through the south end, tongues stuck in gear. A Pop-Tart grows cold on Sara's lap. Then, finally. \nSARA I can take the school bus. Tomorrow. \nROY School bus? That's the other Oz, Dorothy. Patterson kids ride the city Metro. Or walk. \n(CONTINUED) \n35   CONTINUED:                                                     35 \nSARA Well, I know how to do both. \nROY Not around here you don't. Not until you get the hang of things. \nSara looks out the window at a full-fledged ghetto. It's all to obvious, the hang of things. Roy glances over at her. \nROY I called about your transcripts. You're all set. Patterson's got a pretty good Humanities program. No ballet, but we can find a studio someplace close for after school -- \nSARA -- I don't think I'll have time. I have to study, I'll be busy. \nRoy can hear the lie behind her words.      The pain too. He lights a cigarette, cracks the window.      He wants to say the right thing. \nROY Good idea. Take a break. Not too long a break though. You're a dancer. You should dance. Stay on top of your art. \nSARA Like you stay on top of yours? \nROY Maybe I ain't playin' no grand ballrooms or fancy jazz festivals, but I'm playing. \nSARA (unconvincingly) I didn't mean it like that. \nROY S'alright. Hell, I wish I had half the time I wasted gettin' wasted. But those days are over. You'll see. I got my life on track. \n36   EXT. PATTERSON HIGH SCHOOL (SOUTH BALTIMORE) - MORNING       36 \nFormidably large and surprisingly well-kept, Patterson serves the nearby, predominantly black O'Donnell Heights Projects. Kids malinger outside on the front steps and lawn. \n37   FROM ANOTHER ANGLE - PARKING LOT                             37 \nRoy's pickup pulls in. Roy CUTS the ENGINE. Sara looks at him. Or through him. She won't let his eyes connect. \nSARA You don't have to go in with me. Since I'm all set. I mean, I have done this before. Gone to school. I'll be fine. I am fine. Really. \nRoy regards her with weary resignation.   Sara climbs out. He calls after her. \nROY -- Pick you up. Three-thirty. \nSARA (over a shoulder) Yeah.   Sure. Whatever. \n38   EXT./INT. PATTERSON HIGH - MORNING                           38 \nSara moving TOWARD us PAST a floating mosaic of black faces. This is a near out-of-body experience for her. She walks like a well-rehearsed soldier in a stiff straight line to the school's entrance. It's clogged with students. Inside the doorway, two security guards flank a metal detector. When it's Sara's turn to pass through, one of the guards grabs her backpack and wordlessly begins searching it. He hands it back to her on the other side of the detector where Sara stands obtusely and mutely amazed. \n39   INT. ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - MORNING                       39 \nTHROUGH a window, Sara seated across from an ADMINISTRATOR. We PUSH IN. \nADMINISTRATOR ... It's no fun being uprooted in the middle of your senior year. We realize that and we'll do what we can to help with the transition. \n(CONTINUED) \n39   CONTINUED:                                                        39 \nThere's a KNOCK at door. MRS. GWYNN, the Guidance Counselor, steps in. The Administrator introduces her to Sara. Sara regards Mrs. Gwynn with polite petulance. \nMRS. GWYNN Any questions?     Concerns? \nSARA About school?     No.   Not really. \nMRS. GWYNN Not even about Baltimore? \nSARA I'm not gonna be here that long. Besides, it's just a city, right? \nMrs. Gwynn looks at her squarely. But the brick wall doesn't move an inch. Sara feels too safe behind it. \n40   INT. HALLWAY - MORNING                                            40 \nClutching new textbooks, Sara starts down the hallway. She's hoping nothing in her face reveals the rising panic in her heart. She's surrounded. Alone. Every inch of her feels afraid. \nSARA'S POV \nas she MOVES FORWARD. A crush of KIDS -- mostly black with a sprinkling of white and Latino faces thrown in. Kids like her. Only they don't dress like her. They dress like commercials for Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein. And they definitely don't sound like her... \n44   INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF CAFETERIA - NOON                             44 \nLunchtime. PICK UP Sara among a cattle drive of boisterous students. \n45   CAFETERIA - FOOD LINE - LATER                                        45 \nHundreds of voices unleashed in pure, unadulterated teenage cacophony. Sara's in a queue of kids, working her way down the line. \n(CONTINUED) \n45   CONTINUED:                                                    45 \nShe's as invisible and anonymous as ever. CAMERA TRACKS her FROM the line, TO the cashier, INTO the heart of the dining hall. She stands with a food tray, looking for a place to sit. \nHER POV \nTable cliques of the cafeteria. \nSERIES OF SWEEPING SHOTS \n46   JOCK TABLE                                                    46 \nTwo tables pushed together.    Full. \n47   NERD TABLE                                                    47 \nBarely, pathetically populated but surprisingly diverse. \n48   HIP-HOP TABLE                                                 48 \nLoud, overflowing, fun.    King Patrick and his loyal subjects horse around. \n49   POPULAR TABLE                                                 49 \nOver which a glacial beauty we will come to know as NIKKI DAVIS presides. Girls only. \n50   WHITE TABLE \nNotable for its glaring absence of color.    A girl we will come to know as TONI sits there. \nAnd then PUSHING IN ON -- \n51   CHENILLE'S TABLE                                              51 \nShe's there with a group of girls who eschew pretense. They, like Chenille, are rugged and regular. They know who they are. \nEND OF SERIES OF SWEEPING SHOTS. \n52   ANGLE ON SARA                                                 52 \neyeing Chenille's table. Screwing up courage as she approaches it. She gets there but two black girls are faster. They sit down in the only empty seats. Sara backs off, invisible again. \nON CHENILLE \nglimpsing Sara from the corner of her eye as Sara walks away. \n53   AT NERDS' TABLE - LATER                                       53 \nTime has    passed. The cafeteria is half as full, half as noisy.     Sara sits among the NERDS, a friendly if verbose group.     She's trying to eat but a snooze button is talking    her to death... \nWONK ... I know you're new to the table, but think about it. We're the Y2K generation and nobody takes us seriously. We don't take ourselves seriously. Just look around. Half the student body is D.O.A. -- and that's from the neck up, Clara. \nSARA Sara.   It's Sara. \nCHENILLE (O.S.) Yeah. It's Sara. And you're boring her from the ears down. \nSara looks up, surprised to see Chenille standing there. She flashes a knowing smile at her, indicates Sara's tray. \nCHENILLE You finished? \nSara leaps up with a quick, grateful nod. Beats a hasty retreat from the table. As she and Chenille walk through the cafeteria, Sara shudders with relief. She feels rescued. \nSARA God!    Thank you! \n(CONTINUED) \n53   CONTINUED:                                                      53 \nCHENILLE (laughs) Gotta watch where you sit, girl. And it's Chenille. But you're still welcome. Let's catch some air before the bell rings. \n54   EXT. QUAD - MOMENTS LATER                                       54 \nSara follows Chenille into the \"QUAD,\" four squared off sections outside the cafeteria. There are a few dry- rotted picnic tables scattered around. Other kids -- and they run the gamut -- are seen in clots, sneaking smokes... horsing around... making out. \nSARA'S POV - KIDS OF QUAD \nMALAKAI Business. \nShort-hand. Patrick understands it, nods. Malakai slips the cigarette from behind his ear, openly lights and starts smoking it. CAMERA TRACKS them walking back toward Patterson. \nPATRICK So you're hangin' in, man? Feelin' strong about being back? \nMALAKAI Not at this motherfucker. Out a week and where am I? Fucking home sweet high school. Jail away from jail. You can have it. \nPATRICK You gonna stay though.   Right? \nMALAKAI Judge says it's school or JuVee and I sure as hell ain't goin' back there. Shit. I never knew a year could be such a long time. \nA flash of commiseration, of guilt, crosses Patrick's face. They're at the doors now. Most of the kids have gone. Malakai puts his cigarette out on the floor as they step in. \n(CONTINUED) \n54   CONTINUED:                                                    54 \nPATRICK You up for some hoops after school? Break your free-throw back in. Chump the chumps like we used to. \nMALAKAI Up for it? Hell-the-fuck yeah, man. Let's do it. \n55   EXT. PATTERSON HIGH - THAT DAY (AFTER SCHOOL)                 55 \nSara exits with Chenille. A CAR HORN starts to blare. Both of them ignore it. But it goes on like a musical number. Sara gets a sinking feeling that drops like a stone when she looks across the street. Roy's parked at the curb, waiting for her. She rolls her eyes and he HONKS AGAIN. Then he waves at her. Waves! Chenille looks at Sara. Then at Roy. \nCHENILLE That's your old man? Now he's cute. \nSARA He's embarrassing. \nCHENILLE (laughs) Yeah.   He is. For you. \n56   INT./EXT. ROY'S TRUCK - CONTINUOUS ACTION                     56 \nSara climbs in, slams the door. Roy looks over at her, unaware of how annoyed she is with him. She's a clenched fist inside. \nROY How'd it go? \nSARA Fine. (as he pulls off) Tomorrow I catch the bus. \n57   INT. ROY'S APARTMENT - SARA'S \"ROOM\" - NIGHT                  57 \nSara's moving the partition around, trying to make her room more like a room. Trying to build another wall between her and Roy. \n(CONTINUED) \n57   CONTINUED:                                                       57 \nROY (O.S.) Hey, Sara.   C'mere a minute. \nSara lets out a heavy sigh.        What does he want? \nSARA What? \nROY (O.S.) Just come here. \nShe walks into the kitchen. Roy's in front of the open freezer door. Grinning from ear to ear. He motions her over. Sara crosses to the freezer. Looks inside. \nINSERT - INSIDE FREEZER \nIt's full of frozen dinners.       They're in unruly, lopsided stacks. \nBACK TO SCENE \nRoy regards her expectantly. \nROY Hungry and Healthys. I asked at the market. They're the best. So. What do you feel like? (whimsically) Lamb Chop Suey? Tropical Tuna? Primavera Paradise? \nSARA I had a big lunch. \nRoy, deflated, closes the freezer door, trails her into the living area. Sara's clenching again. There's no escaping him. \nROY What do you wanna do? You wanna hang out with me? Go to my gig. You can if you want. \nSARA It's a school night, Roy. \nROY Right.   School night.    Got it. \n58   INT. ROY'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - SARA - LATER            58 \nRoy's gone. Sara takes her first good look around. A mess. It drives home where she is. What she's lost. It's overwhelming. \n59   INT. ROY'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - CLOSE ON EMPTY T.V.         59 DINNER TRAY - NIGHT \nAn empty beer bottle, one askew kitchen chair. Vestiges of Roy's meal. ANGLE WIDENS as Sara enters. She opens the freezer to unearth a dinner and starts an avalanche of falling food. A box of Sugar Puffs cereal lands at her feet. Something else out of place. She picks it up, jams everything back into the freezer. Slams the door shut. \nSARA (yanks her hand back) Who died and made you teacher? \nPatrick pulls back, looks at her. He can't believe she dissed him. A small smile forms on his face. Sara turns away from it, goes back to her vials. Patrick slides to the farthest end of the table. Watches her consternation with bemusement. \nPATRICK Know the difference between ethyl glycol and methyl acetate? Both got three elements, two parts the same. It's that first part, C2 versus C3. C3 could blow a vial right out a person's hand. \nSara thinks he's messing with her. But then the contents of the beaker begin to ominously bubble. Panicked, she drops the vial into their sink. It instantly goes up in smoke. Some of the liquid splashes on Sara's lab coat. Patrick grabs a wet towel, quickly wipes it off. The class stops cold. Hill rushes up to them. Once he's sure Sara's fine, he looks sternly at Patrick. \nMR. HILL What happened?      Everybody back in your seats! \nPatrick stares at Sara.     Her face is red.     She's biting her lip. \nPATRICK I misread the component. \nMR. HILL (even more angry now) You? You misread a component. Don't give me that, Patrick. You were screwin' around! \n(CONTINUED) \n66   CONTINUED:                                                       66 \nHill's tone is searing. He turns to     Sara. She's trying to say something but the words won't    come out. Hill regards her wearily, then walks off    pushing the curious class back to their stations. Sara     looks at Patrick, weakly mouths \"thanks.\" \n67   INT. GYMNASIUM - NIGHT                                           67 \nOver the sound of GRUNTING... OPEN CLOSE ON a girl's plump ass. Squirming in too-tight gym shorts that hug the cheeks. ANGLE WIDENS to reveal a stout white girl on a balance beam. Trying to get her legs to stand up on it. Hanging on for dear life. From somewhere around her, a WHISTLE BLOWS. \nTEACHER (O.S.) Alright, Ms. Diggs. Time! \nWIDEN to see the teacher and her class (FAVOR Sara, Chenille, and Nikki). Amid snickers, the stout girl (\"DIGGY\") slides off the beam, walks past the teacher with her head demurely cast down. Clearing the teacher, Diggy pivots around, both middle fingers in the air. Gives up the double bird with much attitude. The class loves it. Cheers it. Until the teacher swerves around. \n67   SERIES OF CLOSE CUTS                                             67 \nChenille on balance beam.    competent but average. \nNikki on balance beam.    Agile.   Self-assured.   Good. \n... And then TIGHTER STILL on Sara. Tentatively approaching the balance beam. Mindful of all the eyes on her, all the bated breaths. All waiting to see the new girl fall on her ass. Sara swings herself onto the beam with aplomb. Her legs and body are strong, supple, pliable rubber bands. She flounces across it on her tiptoes. Does a flawless split. Hops off. Looks out. \nSARA'S POV - TEACHER AND CLASS \nReacting with shock and surprise. Awed. Except for Nikki. She stands there with her arms folded. Simmering. Envious. \n68   PATTERSON HIGH - END OF SCHOOL THAT DAY                          68 \nSara. Heading down the steps with other students. Chenille and Diggy break through the logjam, catch up to her. (CONTINUED) \n68   CONTINUED:                                                        68 \nCHENILLE Girl, how you get your legs to twist like that? \nDIGGY (wildly gesticulating) Yeah. What was all that double- jointed cheerleader shit? \nCHENILLE This is Diggy.     Thinks she's down. \nDIGGY Egg-cuse me?     I am down. \nCHENILLE So, Sara.   What's up with that? \nSARA (awkwardly) Nothing's up with it. I used to kind of dance. Ballet. Mostly. \nChenille makes an impressed face.          Regards Sara curiously. \nCHENILLE You should hit Feetz with us tomorrow night. It's a club. Sorta members only. \nDIGGY Un-der-ground. \nSARA I don't know... \nCHENILLE Come on and hang out. Snook dee's sometime. He can get you in. (yelling) Yo, Snook \nSara sees Snookie... then Patrick... loping her way. She steels herself. He's going to say something, crack some joke about her nearly blowing him up. But Patrick just stares at her with a twinkle in his eyes. A nice twinkle. Sara's not entirely immune to it. Chenille breaks their eye play, pushes Patrick aside. She grabs Snookie's arm, indicates Sara. \n(CONTINUED) \n68   CONTINUED:                                                      68 \nCHENILLE She needs to get hooked up for Feetz. All the way up. Sara, give Snook twenty dollars. \nSARA For what? \nSNOOKIE I.D. Eye-dee. How you think you gettin' in? On your looks? (rolling his eyes) Chenille, your girl is weak. Shit. I got my rep to watch. I can't just be gettin' any green in. \nSara glares.     Regards Snookie with a sweeping scowl. \nSARA Look closer. And if I still look green, I think maybe you should wipe the crust from your eyes. \nNIKKI Oh?   It's gonna be like that. \nPATRICK How'd you think it was gonna be? That you was gonna drop me and pick me up whenever you felt like it? \nNIKKI It ain't all that serious, Patrick. \nPATRICK It ain't anymore, Nikki.     Not to me. \nHe walks off. CAMERA TRACKS him going deep inside the club. He wants a drink. He's almost at the bar when he sees Chenille on the dance floor with Kenny. She shrugs a smile, then cocks her head over at the bar. Toward Sara. The look is like, help me out. Don't let me leave her hangin'. Patrick rolls his eyes as he glances at Sara, before he really sees her. She looks fly. Hugely fly. He ambles up as she shouts into the bartender's ear. \nSARA Rum and Coke, straight up. And a beer. I don't care. Anything. \nPATRICK (O.S.) Bad choice.      'Anything.' \nThe closeness of his voice startles her. She turns into his smile. That cocksure, leave'em-weak-in-the-knees smile. \nSARA It's just a beer. \nPATRICK Then it should be the best beer. You'd know that if you really drank. \nSara's knees straighten, her spine stiffens.         The asshole's back. \nSARA Whatever. \nPATRICK What's that mean? Whatever. \n(CONTINUED) \n80   CONTINUED:                                                   80 \nSARA Whatever you want it to mean. You're the whiz kid, right? You know everything. \nPATRICK (chuckles at this, at her) Not everything. Like I don't know why we're standin' still. (closer with a teasing whisper) I'm supposed to be dizzy by now. Remember? From all those circles you danced around me. \nSara leans against the bar.    The knees are going again. \nSARA I don't feel like dancing. \nPATRICK But you do know how...? \nSARA Would I be here if I didn't? \nPATRICK ... Let's do it then.    C'mon. \nHe coaxes her onto the dance floor. PARLIAMENT'S funk classic \"Flashlight\" is playing. The dance crowd is robustly singing the refrain to the song. There's a party on the floor. FAVOR Sara and Patrick, facing each other. He's moving already. She starts to dance, stiffly, tentatively. Patrick smiles at her. Shakes his head. He grabs her hands, swings them in time to the music. \nPATRICK Now move your hips. Not so fast. (as Sara looks lost) Sara! Just like our hands. (singing, in sync with the crowd) 'Flashlight! Neon light! Stop light! Everybody got a little light under the sun.' \nThe music's beginning to feel good to Sara. Patrick lets go of her hands. Starts to dance. Sara watches him intensely, her body follows his stiffly. Patrick's a good teacher. He leads without leaving her. Whenever she misses a complicated move, he smoothly segues into another less-complicated one. (CONTINUED) \n80   CONTINUED:                                                    80 \nSara begins to pick-up on Patrick's rhythm. Her eyes never wander from his. And then she starts to feel something else. They both do. A rising beat. A quickening heart. And not from the dancing. She smiles bashfully at him. Patrick suddenly grabs her around the waist, pulls her to him in a sexy spoon dance. All Sara can do is try to keep up and hang on. \nFROM ANOTHER ANGLE \nNikki avidly watching Sara and Patrick with Jasmin and Tiff'ny. \nJASMIN She's all up in your nut, Nikki... Oh, that's right. It ain't your nut anymore. \nNIKKI It is if I want it to be. He is if I want him to be. That bitch ain't got shit on me. \nThe girls regard her in conspicuous, dubious silence. Nikki maintains her cool but inside her pride is pricking. \n81   INT. FEETZ - SAME TIME                                        81 \nMalakai and the clinging girl nuzzle in a back corner. She licks his ear, whispers into it. Malakai laughs. Then his expression abruptly darkens. A storm cloud comes over it. He gets up. \nMALAKAI'S POV - WALKING TOWARD \n... two dealers a few feet away. They're talking to an Asian guy with a multi-colored Mohawk. One slips Mohawk a packet of coke, the other takes his money. WIDER as Malakai reaches the dealers. He doesn't explain, doesn't complain. He just starts swinging. \nSARA AND PATRICK \nThe MUSIC changes and their dance ends. They stand there for a moment, a little caught up in each other. A little unsure of the moment. And then there's a scream! Several of them actually. Patrick reacts to it instinctively. Looking around. In a small pocket of the club he sees Malakai. \n(CONTINUED) \n81   CONTINUED:                                                       81 \nPATRICK'S POV - MALAKAI \nin full fisticuffs with the two dealers.     Holding his own. \nON PATRICK \nPATRICK Why you keep lookin' at me? \nSARA I have to look somewhere. The streets are deserted. Might as well look at you. \nPATRICK That's not why. You wanna know somethin'. Ask somethin'. \nSARA It's not a question. It's the way you were beating that kid up. You looked so mad. \nPATRICK I was mad and he wasn't no kid. But you're from the suburb Mars, right? Folks don't fight there. \nSARA Not like that. (some kind of wonder) You were really kicking his ass. \nIt's not funny, the look on her face.      But Patrick laughs. \nSARA Are you laughing at me? \nDropping the smile, Patrick shakes his head.      Looks at her. \nPATRICK My friend was in trouble. \nSARA Maybe he's my question. Your friend. Chenille doesn't like him. \nPATRICK She likes him. It don't stop her from trippin' off him now and then. But Malakai's good people. We go back. Way back. You know, like they say, through thick and thin. (beat) So, how'd you like Feetz? \n(CONTINUED) \n85   CONTINUED:                                                       85 \nSARA It was great. \nPATRICK Once you got used to the music. \nSARA It wasn't the music I wasn't used to. I mean, it's not the first time I heard hip-hop, Patrick. \nPATRICK Uh-huh. Bet you listen to it all the time. \nPatrick regards her with a sly, knowing smile. His stare is significant, unsettling. Sara's face flushes. She turns from him, hoping he didn't see it. \nSARA Not all the time. But a lot. \nPATRICK We gettin' any closer to your crib or should we stop for food and water? \nSara snaps out of it. Looks around. Shit. First the flush and now this. She looks at him. She could kick herself. \nSARA We passed it. \nPATRICK You passed it. \nA look. They double back to her front door.        Pause on the stoop. \nSARA Thanks for walking me. \nPATRICK No problem. \nSARA So.      I'll see ya. \nPATRICK Is that 'see ya' like gee-whiz, had a great time, can't wait to see you again? (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n85   CONTINUED:                                                       85 \nPATRICK (CONT'D) Or is it like 'see ya,' I'll bust a cap in your ass if you ever darken my doorstep again? \nHe makes it impossible not to smile.     So damned charming. \nSARA I haven't said gee-whiz since I was six. But I really had a great time... okay? \nPATRICK Okay. \nShe enters the rowhouse. Patrick waits until the lights go on inside before he turns around and starts home. \n86   INT. ROY'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NEXT MORNING                    86 \nRoy's making breakfast when Sara straggles in. She peers at the stove. Scrambled eggs and bacon. Toast too! A first for him. \nROY Figured I'd put a little marrow in your bones. Siddown, siddown. (she slumps in chair) You gettin' along at school? Makin' friends...? (as she nods robotically) ... See any of 'em last night? \nHe slides a plate in front of her.      Stands there holding his. \nROY I came home on my break. \nSARA Oh. \nThe succinct sneer in her voice gets to Roy.       He snaps at her. \n90   INT. PATTERSON HIGH - HALLWAY - MORNING                          90 \nA fight. Two black girls having at it. It's a ferocious match. Hair pulling, spit flying, punches landed, clothes torn apart. \nANGLE ON SARA \nas she crowns the corner, comes to a bottleneck of students. It's like the nose bleed section of Caesar's Palace. The far hallway is the ring. Sara cranes her neck to see the action. (CONTINUED) \n90   CONTINUED:                                                   90 \nANGLE WIDENS as a security guard earns his hazard pay. He separates the two girls who are still swinging at each other. He throws one into a corner, hurls the other in an opposite corner. \nON SARA \nas a WHITE GIRL standing next to her shakes her head lamentably. \nSARA What happened? \nThe White Girl studies Sara's suburban clothes and fresh- scrubbed face. Thinks she found a kindred spirit. \nTONY (WHITE GIRL) We freed the slaves and didn't teach them no manners. (before Sara can react) You're Sara, right? (as Sara warily nods) Toni. I was gonna introduce myself before but you're always with that crowd. You know. Chenille, her girls, that identity crisis Diggy. \nSara looks at Toni. Getting it. Getting her. The expression on her face closes off. Toni, too dense to read it, keeps talking. \nTONI (brightly) We should hang out sometime, Sara. The two of us. Whenever you decide to lose the tan? \nHer inference clear, Toni flashes a brilliant smile, happily walks off. Sara shakes her head to herself. What an idiot. \nAs Sara continues down the hall, a P.A. address comes on. \nP.A. ADDRESS (V.O.) Seniors, a reminder before you rise up and change the world. Mrs. Gwynn is holding all diplomas hostage in her office. Her only demand is the pleasure of your company for career D-Day. Be there. \nSara enters her classroom, a bunch of kids in front of and behind her. \n91   EXT./INT. STREET/ROY'S ROWHOUSE (SO. BALTIMORE) - DAY           91 \nSara walks up the street (passing many black people), sees Roys' pickup. Shit. He's home. \n92   CAMERA TRACKS                                                   92 \nSara as she enters their rowhouse, walks up a flight of stairs to their apartment. There's a JAZZ INSTRUMENTAL FAINTLY coming from it. And another NOISE. Foreign and yet familiar. Like grunting... but not. Sara unlocks the door. Opens it. \n93   SARA'S POV - LIVING ROOM                                        93 \nHer father's fucking somebody! On the couch. Half on it anyway. In broad daylight! The whore underneath him is moaning. Jesus! \nANGLE WIDENS as Sara turns away from the spectacle. Reaches for Roy's sax. She blows the longest, shrillest note known to mankind. \n94   ON ROY                                                          94 \nThe hair on his head stands up.    His body deflates instantly. \n95   INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER                                    95 \nSara sits at the table. Roy enters in a wrinkled T-shirt and battered jeans. His embarrassment is naked. \nROY I don't know what to say.    I don't. \nSARA How 'bout fuck it? Or should I say fuck her? It's a fuck-fest, Roy. \nROY Don't talk to    me like that, Sara. (beat) I thought you    were goin' to your friend's house    after school. Obviously, you    changed your mind. So I'm sorry.     Alright? \nSARA Sorry you got caught. \n(CONTINUED) \n95   CONTINUED:                                                   95 \nROY Sorry I got... observed \nThe \"whore\" with the Hich C is RHONDA. She stands between the living area and the kitchen entrance now. Sara tries not to look at her. Can't help it. She has to see the whore. Not bad looking, in a washed out, bottle blonde barfly kind of way. \nRHONDA Don't be mad at him. It's my fault. I'm real sorry, honey. \nROY It's nobody's 'fault.' It's over. Let it be over. We're all adults. \nSara glares at him.     The disingenuous Rhonda jumps in. \nRHONDA I think he means you know about sex. That we have it and he likes it. Isn't that what you mean, Roy? \nSara looks at her.     Bats her eyes.   Hard. \nSARA Really?   How often do you have it? \nRHONDA Things been kind of slow since you got here. Once upon a time we were real rabbits, weren't we, Roy? \n103   SERIOUS STUDENT                                                  103 \nSERIOUS STUDENT I want to be a lawyer, but I believe in God so I'm not sure about it... \n104   TONI                                                             104 \nTONI I'm moving to Idaho.

But you can't live your life like a popularity contest. \n108   MONTAGE ENDS WITH SARA                                        108 \nwalking in.     Sitting down. \nSARA I don't think it's realistic, what you're asking. Things happen. Things change. And the changes change you. What's the point of plans? \nMRS. GWYNN To have a sense of direction. \nSARA You can't direct destiny. \n(CONTINUED) \n108   CONTINUED:                                                    108 \nMRS. GWYNN (fingering Sara's papers) I see here that you trained for Juilliard, that you auditioned. \nSARA That was a long time ago. \nMRS. GWYNN It was three months ago, Sara. (the brick wall) Well, if you're not going to pursue dance, what are you going to do? \nSARA (hadn't thought about it) I don't know. Take a year off. Work. Go to college later on. \nMRS. GWYNN Be careful with later on, Sara. It's a slippery slope. Sometimes you can run right on top of it and it never catches up with you. \n109   EXT. O'DONNELL HEIGHTS - ROOFTOP - LATE DAY                   109 \nA low sun over the cityscape of Baltimore. PUSH IN ON Patrick and Sara, two dots that grow larger. He CLICKS ON a BOOM-BOX resting on the roof's ledge. A hip-hop track BLASTS. \nPATRICK Feel the groove. Don't let the music mess with you. \nHe starts to move with the music. Sara tries to emulate him. They dance throughout the conversation. \nSARA Did you always want to be a doctor? \nPATRICK Who said I wanna be a doctor? \nSARA Chenille.   Everybody. \nHe cinches her waist, pushes in her ass. \n(CONTINUED) \n109   CONTINUED:                                                               109 \nPATRICK Keep it tight.     Watch your butt. \nSARA What kind of doctor do you want to be? \nPATRICK Pediatrics. I like kids.         Come on, stay with me. You're slackin'. \nSARA Do you have any? Kids. \nPATRICK No.   Do you? \nKENNY You don't ask, Chenille. You make demands. You want money, you -- \nCHENILLE -- I want you to pick up some of the slack. You always have an excuse. \nKENNY It's not like that.    I get tied up. \nCHENILLE You wanna talk about tied up? Try gettin' up in the middle of the night to change diapers and give him bottles or stayin' up with him when he's sick and havin' to drag your ass to school the next day. \nKENNY Look.

PATTERSON HIGH - GIRLS' LAVATORY - MORNING                  112 \nDripping, out-of-order faucets, graffiti-laced stalls, litter-strewn floors are underscored by the spooky flicker of fluorescent lights. Sara walks in. The bathroom appears to be empty. She's about to enter a stall when she hears the murmur of a voice. A guy's voice. Then a girl's whimper. She eases forward a bit. \nGIRL (O.S.) I don't get paid 'til next week. \nMALE (O.S.) Boo the fuck hoo. You can't put my bizness up your nose on no layaway plan. C'mon now.

She cranes her neck trying to see without being sen. \nHER POV - STALL \nA GIRL is seated on the toilet. A man straddles her, his crotch in her face. The Girl sees Sara. Something in her face gives this away. The \"man\" glances out past his shoulder. He looks right down our throat straight into Sara's eyes. Malakai. \nON SARA \nSARA What are you doing? \nMalakai backs up. The Girl jumps up, runs out the lavatory. Malakai zips up his pants. Sara's frozen, staring at him. \nMALAKAI You didn't see nothin', you don't say nothin'. Not unless you want a taste for yourself. And that can be arranged. \nHe leaves.     Sara waits a moment.   Exits. \n113   HALLWAY                                                          113 \nShe sees Mr. Hill, starts to move for him. Someone grabs her arm from behind. She turns, startled, a little afraid. It's the Girl from the stall. She looks Sara in the eye. Shakes her head. Don't. Mr. Hill walks by them unbeckoned. \n114   EXT. INNER HARBOR (DOWNTOWN BALTIMORE) - PARK - DAY              114 \nA perfect day. CAMERA PANS FROM the waterfront TO the bustling crowds of the inner harbor, then to a park across from this where Sara and Patrick are practicing. HIP-HOP MUSIC softly PLAYS from Patrick's BOOM-BOX.

I was gonna go to Juilliard. That school fucked up my entire life. It's a long story. \nPATRICK Let me guess. You don't wanna talk about it. \nSara looks at him.

Most of the time. \nSARA I don't get you guys.    You seem so... different. \nPATRICK We're not. \nSARA Maybe you weren't then but you are now.

(mumbling to himself) Three months and she's skipping? \n133   INT. FEETZ - BAR - NIGHT                                       133 \nUsual suspects, usual music. Patrick hands Sara a call- brand beer. Leans in with his drink, openly and contently with her. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nNikki and her crew (Jasmin, Tiff'nee, Alyssa). Nikki hasn't seen Patrick and Sara. She's showing her crew a dance. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nChenille, Diggy and another black girl.     Fraternizing. \nANOTHER ANGLE - DEEJAY BOOTH \nA chrome-domed deejay with a Barry White baritone bellows into his mike as he changes the music. \nDEEJAY Master P with the 'Ghetto D'. Showmesomethin', showmesomethin', give up that cruel. Eyes on you! \nWIDER as the dance floor swells with kids. PICK UP Sara and Patrick among them. She looks at him nervously. He smiles. \nPATRICK Nobody's watchin' you but me. \nA gallant lie. Sara tries    to believe it. They dance. Practice has made her near   perfect. Their movements are ambitious, nimble, better   than anyone else on the floor. They move so well together   that Snookie, dancing nearby, starts chanting: \nSNOOKIE Go, Patrick!    Go, Patrick! \n(CONTINUED) \n133   CONTINUED:                                                       133 \nFROM ANOTHER ANGLE OF DANCE FLOOR \nCAMERA TRACKS them as they walk down the hall hand-in- hand, sometimes exchanging greetings with other students. They are officially a couple and they appear to be in love. At the door to Sara's next class, Patrick busses her lips before she enters. \n137   INT. SARA'S CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION                          137 \nNo teacher is present. The class files in. Toni drops down in a chair beside Sara. She leans over in a conspiratorial whisper. \nTONI Whatever you do, don't fuck him. \n(CONTINUED) \n137   CONTINUED:                                                        137 \nSARA Excuse me? \nTONI 'Hit it and quit it,' that's their motto. \nSARA Whose motto? \nTONI Black guys.    Everybody knows that. \nThe teacher walks in.       Sara quickly whispers back to Toni. \nSARA Don't forget, they all have big dicks and beat their wives. Everybody knows that too. \n138   INT. RIB JOINT (SOMEWHERE IN BALTIMORE) - NIGHT                   138 \nMalakai, along with Snookie and two brain donors, ARVEL and LIP, eat at a booth. Patrick strolls in gritty from work. Tired from work. He slides in next to Malakai. The mood is light, jovial. \nARVEL You smell, boy. \nPATRICK How can a piece of shit tell? \nThe table cracks up. \nMALAKAI You been scarce lately, man. Where you been? \nARVEL Somewhere dreamin' of a White Christmas... \nLIP ... And Christmas ain't even for 'nother six months. \nSNOOKIE Lip. It's a so-to-speak thang, you ignorant fuck.

Whassup. \nPATRICK (snatching up one of his ribs) Back out my business, boy. \nMALAKAI (watching Patrick keenly) You tappin' that white girl, man? (half joking) That's why you ain't got time for your boyz no more, you too busy frontin'. Too busy snowflakin'. \nPatrick lifts one of Malakai's ribs, responds coolly. \nPATRICK How am I frontin', 'Kai? I made time for this bullshit, didn't I? \nLIP Aww, man. You busted. That's why your jaws are gettin' so tight. \nSNOOKIE You the one need his jaws tightened with your pork-ass instigatin' self. \nARVEL (re: Patrick's roving fingers) Order somethin', Patrick. This ain't no goddamn soup line. \nPatrick grabs some of Arvel's fries, chews them in his face. \nPATRICK Y'all hangin' tonight or what? \nMALAKAI We thinkin' about slidin' through that new rec center opened up on the Eastside. You ridin'? \nPATRICK Eastside?   That's the wrong side. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n138   CONTINUED:                                                     138 \nPATRICK (CONT'D) I ain't messin' with those fools over there. You know how they are. \nMALAKAI I ain't pressed. I got my own shit. \nShorthand. The table stops. Malakai glances around, lifts his shirt to expose a gun. Patrick stares at Malakai with disbelief. \nMALAKAI What you think? I'ma keep walkin' around waitin' for some chump to cap me? I'ma protect myself. \nPATRICK That ain't protection. It's an excuse for some unnecessary mayhem. \nMALAKAI Ain't nothin' unnecessary 'bout it. Shit. Mayhem and madness. That's a black man's life. \nROY Yeah? Well, when are you gonna have the guts to say what you really want to say to me, Sara? \n(CONTINUED) \n139   CONTINUED:                                                     139 \nSARA (screaming at him) Want me to say it? You were a piece of shit husband and you're a piece of shit father! You were never there for Mom or for me. You took off and never looked back. So don't talk to me about guts. \nNot quite the truth, but near enough to sting. It quiets Roy down. He regards her with regret and guilt. \nROY Sounds like you have it all figured out. \nSARA I have you figured out. You think you can make up all the time you missed, all the things you didn't do? You can't! I'm here because I have to be and it's a goddamned nightmare. \nROY Well, you might as well wake up and get used to it, Sara, because that's the way things are sometimes, the way life is. \nSARA How the hell would you know? You've been asleep for the past thirty-seven years! \nNow she does storm off. This time Roy lets her.     He can't find the words to deny what she's said. \n140   EXT. PATTERSON HIGH - QUAD OUTSIDE CAFETERIA - DAY             140 \nA break between classes draws the requisite claques and cliques. Sara and Patrick huddle over a chemistry book, attentive to each other. Nikki stands off watching both of them. Malakai saunters up to her smoking a joint. Hazily indicates Patrick and Sara. \nMALAKAI The 'Love Boat.' \nNIKKI Love shit. That bitch is tap- dancin' on my last nerve. \n(CONTINUED) \n140   CONTINUED:                                                      140 \nMALAKAI Looks like she's tap-dancing on your last boyfriend. She got it like that? Naw. Never mind. Stall it. I ain't heard shit. \nNIKKI Stall what?   What you hear? \nMALAKAI Some trash she's talkin'.   About you. \nNIKKI About me? \nMALAKAI Yeah. How you ain't all 'at since Patrick's takin' her to the prom. (in for the kill) I am a little bit... chagrined though, Nikki. You lettin' some white ho' show you up like that. \nHe regards her with bemused pity. Nikki, with all her inner outrage, manages to salvage her pride. She sneers in his face. \nNIKKI Fuck you, Malakai. Fuck her too. \nMALAKAI (gaily, a she sails off) Ain't no need in fuckin' me... stuck up, bitch... I'm on your side \n141   INT. PATTERSON HIGH - HALLWAY - DAY                             141 \nPatrick drinks at a water fountain. Looks up. Malakai's standing there. There's still some tension between them. \nMALAKAI Yo. Me and the boyz fixin' to shoot some hoops. Us against Druid Hill. If you interested. \nPATRICK Druid Hill?   Hell yeah. \nMALAKAI Gotta skip last period. \n(CONTINUED) \n141   CONTINUED:                                                   141 \nPATRICK I got study hall. Don't matter anyway. Not with those suckers. I'll be back before the bell rings. \nThey walk off together and, after a few steps, begin dribbling imaginary balls down the hall. \n142   INT. GYM (PATTERSON) - DAY                                   142 \nA girls' basketball game in progress. Sara's playing defense. She's on Nikki's team. She blocks a shot but Chenille, on the opposing team, gets it on the rebound. Basket. Nikki shoots Sara a murderous look. Stupid, uncoordinated bitch. \n143   EXT. DRUID HILL PLAYGROUND - BASKETBALL COURT                143 \nA four-on-four game in progress. Patrick, Malakai, Snookie and Arvel versus the Druid Hill Two Deuces. An unseen BOOM BOX BLASTS the music of JAY-Z throughout. Patrick has the ball. He passes it to Malakai. They AD- LIB insults to the Two Deuces. This is heaven for them. Talking shit and playing ball. The best time. \nINTERCUT WITH: \n144   INT. PATTERSON HIGH - GYM                                    144 \nSara takes her defensive position against an opposing player, successfully blocks the shot, tries to slam the ball to Nikki. It clips Nikki's head, bounces out of bounds. Nikki, her dignity stunned, her patience out, walks up to Sara, shoves her to the floor. Sara looks up at her as some disembodied voice calls out: \nFEMALE VOICE Don't start nothin', won't be nothin'! Stay down, girl! \n145   EXT. DRUID HILL - BASKETBALL COURT                           145 \nMalakai dribbles the ball around one of the Two Deuces, skies it. Misses the hoop. Patrick rebounds. Passes it back to 'Kai. He takes the shot. Makes it. Patrick and Arvel strut victoriously. \nDIONDRE (a taunting twist) I can go where I want. You the one on punishment. \nNikki swings a wet shirt with no intention of hitting him. She looks up. Patrick's standing in the doorway. Diondre runs up to him, holds out the palm of his hand. \n(CONTINUED) \n154   CONTINUED:                                                     154 \nDIONDRE There she go.    Gimme my two dollars. \nPatrick pays him. Diondre darts out. Patrick walks up to Nikki. Nikki clenches, tries to dismiss him with a backhanded wave. \nNIKKI Whatever it is, I don't wanna hear it. \nPatrick leans up against a washing machine and for a long moment just looks at her. The walk there has composed his emotions. \nPATRICK I thought you had somethin' to say to me. \nNIKKI You thought wrong. \nAn old black woman is avidly, openly watchin' them. Patrick indicates a bench on the other side of the laundromat. Nikki petulantly follows him there. They sit. Patrick looks at her. \nPATRICK Somethin' must be on your mind for you to get up in Sara's face, start all this drama. What you tryin' to prove, Nikki? \nNIKKI You're the one tryin' to prove something. Stuck up in her shit like she's somethin' special. \nPATRICK What if she is? What's it to you? You didn't see me trippin' off that Howard dude and I could have. I coulda tripped hard, Nikki. \nNIKKI That was different. \nPATRICK How you gonna call it different? \nShe stands up.     Looks down at him.    Raises her voice. \n(CONTINUED) \n154   CONTINUED:                                                  154 \nNIKKI Because she's white and he ain't. And don't sit there like you don't know what I'm talkin' about, Patrick. \nPATRICK (glaring at her) You don't even know what you're talkin' about, Nikki. \nNIKKI I don't?     Y'all black men, soon as you even    think about goin' someplace    good, first thing you do is find a    white girl to take with you. \nOLD WOMAN (O.S.) Uh-huh. \nPatrick glares in the Old Woman's direction, then back at Nikki. \nPATRICK I thought I was goin' someplace good with you. You the one called me off. But you ain't tryin' to remember that. Now you mad. Why? Because she's white and I like her? I'm with her. \nNIKKI Please. You're with her because she's white. That's what sets me off. \nPATRICK (exasperated) It ain't got no business settin' you off! Me and her ain't got nothin' to do with you and what you think. So keep your hands off her and that shit to yourself. \nNikki folds her arms across her chest, looks at him defiantly. \nNIKKI I don't think it, I know it. But you go ahead, deny it. That's what y'all always do. \nShe turns on her heels, goes back to her machine. Patrick rises, sees the old woman glinting at him. He holds her hateful stare for a moment, then walks out. \n155   INT. REYNOLDS' APARTMENT - CHENILLE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT           155 \nChenille and Kenny.     In the middle of a contentious moment. He tries to     give her some money. She snatches it out of his hand.     Kenny looks at her. He's hurt. Chenille's too mad to    see it. \nCHENILLE What? I'm supposed to get excited because you decided to skate by and drop a dollar on the dresser? \nKENNY It's more than a dollar. And it's all I got. (beat) I got laid off rom B.W.I., Chenille. I been workin' part- time. Money's tight. You know how you are about money. That's way I haven't been coming around. \nChenille stares at him for a long moment.       Her voice is low. \nCHENILLE Money ain't got nothin' to do with it, Kenny. You don't come around because you don't feel like comin' around. You don't want the responsibility of comin' around. As long as you out there and I'm in here, you know your son's being taken care of. You ain't got no worries when it comes to him. \nKENNY And you don't have no   feelings when it comes to me.    All you do is bitch and complain   about what I don't do. I get sick    of that. \nCHENILLE Be sick of it. You ain't got to see me to see your son. \nKENNY I'll be sure to keep that in mind. \nHe leaves.    Chenille stands there, mad at him.    Mad at herself. \n156   INT. FREE CLINIC (SOUTH BALTIMORE) - DAY                        156 \nThe lowest common denominator for misery. \n(CONTINUED) \n165   INT. SARA'S ROOM - NIGHT                                      165 \nSara's on the futon, flipping through a photo album. Pictures of her and Glynn. Roy knocks on the partition. Waits a beat before he comes in. He looks at Sara. She keeps flipping. \nROY I was wondering... how long you plan on hating me? Maybe I'm an optimist but I hope there's some kind of timetable. (this raises a small smile) Well, I don't wanna bug you. I just came in to say good luck. \nSara regards him quizzically. Roy goes to her dresser, picks up an envelope from Juilliard. \nROY I saw the return address. Got curious. It was open. I read it. I know I shouldn't have but at least now I have an excuse to tell you how proud I am of you, Sara. \nSARA (quietly miserable) I was gonna tell you about the audition, Roy. I meant to. \nShe's clutching the photo album.    Roy sits down next to her. \nROY Tomorrow's the big day? \nSARA Uh-huh.   The big day. \nROY You bummed out about it? (as she shakes her head) You're a worse liar than I am father. \n(CONTINUED) \n165   CONTINUED:                                                          165 \nSARA You're not so bad. (close to a confession) I didn't give you much to work with. It's not like I've been the perfect daughter. \nROY Well, it ain't like I deserve a perfect daughter. I screwed up. Did everything in a hurry and still thought I had all the time in the world. To be in love with your mother. Be a father to you. But time flies. You look up one day and all you got to show for yourself is a pretty little girl who hates your guts and won't talk to you because too much time went by. \nSara's eyes well up.    Before she can stop herself,        she's crying. \nSARA I don't hate you. I miss her. I miss Mom... (as Roy takes her in his arms, tries to console her) ... Patrick's pissed at me. I'm pissed at him. He's not coming tomorrow and I want him there and I don't know what to do. \nSara draws back from Roy, wipes her tears.       Collects herself. \nROY You want him there. I understand that. But whatever he brings to the table, Patrick can't dance for you, Sara. You're the bottom line out there. This is your chance to be the dancer Juilliard came to see. \nSARA I wanted somebody there who loves me. \nRoy regards her softly, significantly, the irony implicit. \n(CONTINUED) \n165   CONTINUED:                                                     165 \nROY I love you. \nSara looks up.    For the first time in her life, she believes him. \n166   INT. HOSPITAL - I.C.U. WAITING ROOM/CORRIDOR - EVENING         166 \nPatrick's bouncing on his knees, speaking to Arvel's parents, who are clearly stricken. Arvel's father, stoic, holds his wife's hand. Arvel's mother kneads a Kleenex, her face etched with tears. Patrick hugs her. Stands up to see Malakai frozen in the doorway, put off by the palpable grief. Patrick crosses over to him. They retreat quietly into the corridor, their concern for Arvel a shaky ground for conciliation. \nMALAKAI Why his mom's cryin' like that? Arvel's gonna make it, right? That what's his nurse said. She told me herself, 'Your friend's gonna make it.' Did that bitch lie to me! Talk to me, Patrick! Is he gone? \nPatrick steers Malakai away from the waiting room, backs him against a wall and, in a gentle but firm way, holds him there. \nPATRICK They just got bad news, man. They don't need to hear it again. (trying to be strong; faltering) Arvel's fightin'. He's gonna pull through. Thing is, when he does, they don't think... he ain't... shit. Arvel ain't gonna walk again. \nIn that moment, whatever's left of Malakai's soul crumbles. He looks at Patrick with aggrieved disbelief and then a building anger. A stronger man would probably cry. \nPatrick eases his grip. Malakai straightens his body, cocks his head slightly. Studies Patrick in this crooked, derisive way. \nMALAKAI I got a good reason now, man? (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n166   CONTINUED:                                                      166 \nMALAKAI (CONT'D) (off Patrick's silence) Aw'ight, college boy. You do what you think is the right thing. I'ma do what I know is the only thing. \nHe starts to walk off, doesn't get far before Patrick calls out. \nPATRICK Malakai... (a fleeting hesitation) ... When it's on, I'll be there. \n167   EXT. PLAYGROUND (O'DONNELL HEIGHTS PARK) - DAY                  167 \nGroups of children scatter around worn-out playground equipment. The gleeful squeal of them is everywhere. Patrick guides Christopher down a slide; Chenille catches him at the bottom. Christopher can't get enough of this ride and Patrick and Chenille repeat the routine throughout their conversation. \nCHENILLE Why you so quiet? (off Patrick's brooding look) Patrick Reynolds ain't got nothin' to say? That's a first. (catches her son with a whee!; then) You know how I go off on folks sometimes. I mean it and then I don't mean it. Like what I said to Sara. Guess she told you. \nPATRICK (monotone) I don't care what you said, Chenille. \nCHENILLE Patrick. Your ass is on your back and your lips are on the ground. You care, baby brother. And not just about what I said. (as he looks at her) You seriously like Sara. She got a serious jones for you. Am I lyin'? \n(CONTINUED) \n(CONTINUED) \n173   CONTINUED:                                                        173 \nPATRICK What you gonna do, 'Kai? You gonna shoot me? Go ahead! You'll have to! \nLIP Let him out!   We don't need him. \nMALAKAI Shut the fuck up. \nPatrick jerks himself loose. Opens the door. Malakai cocks the gun. Patrick's face flinches at the sound of it. He can feel it trained on his back as he gets out the car. But Malakai can't do it. Wouldn't do it. He takes off like a bat out of hell. \n174   EXT. STREET                                                       174 \nPatrick heads down the street. As he walks, he can hear the sound of GUNFIRE behind him, and then the sound like an EXPLOSION. A CAR HORN goes off in a persistent drone. Patrick stops. Stands there for a moment. Then he's walking again. Without looking back. And then he's running away from the mayhem behind him. \n175   EXT. STREET - SAME TIME                                           175 \nThe BMW's tangled around a street lamp. Inside Malakai slumps over the steering wheel, a bullet through his head. \n176   INT. BALTIMORE SCHOOL OF PERFORMING ARTS - AUDITORIUM -           176 NIGHT \nPince-Nez leads Sara to the stage.      Announces her. \nSara walks onstage. \nShe nods down at the judges, looks out into the audience. Her eyes anxiously search for Patrick... hoping. Her MUSIC begins. \nGrieg's Peer Gynt (Morning). Sara starts to sway, moving like an angel through the soft cloud of this music. Her line, proportion and balance are impeccable. \n(CONTINUED) \n176   CONTINUED:                                                   176 \nTchaikovsky's Swan Lake (Tanz der Schwane) begins and Sara slowly blossoms, opening herself up to the music like a flower. She completes every turn and twist and leap with confidence, energy and persuasion. She is doing what a dancer should do -- engaging the audience, igniting their imagination, drawing them in. \nANGLE - JUDGES \nperking up, taking notes, attentive to her. \nSARA \nfinishes with a flawless arabesque.      Looks out. \nREVERSE ANGLE - JUDGES \nOne of the more imperious-appearing JUDGES removes his glasses, speaks to her. Sara's still trying to catch her breath. \nSTERN JUDGE You prepared a free-form? \nSARA Yes... sir... they have... my music. \nJUDGE Does it have a theme? \nSARA Yes.  Emo... (clears her throat) Emotion. \nThe Judge turns around, shouts to someone we can't see: \nSTERN JUDGE Cue Johnson's music. \nMUSIC UP: A remix of hip-hop (e.g., LAURYN'S HILL'S doo wop; NAS'S \"We Will Survive\" and JAY Z's latest) and snatches of CLASSICAL. \nSARA \nstands there. Doesn't move. Can't. She finally walks up to the edge of the stage. Looks down at the judges, her eyes filled with trepidation. Her voice is a shaky whisper. (CONTINUED) \n176   CONTINUED:                                                          176 \nSARA I'm sorry. I wasn't ready.       Can you start it over again? \nREVERSE ANGLE \nThe Judge waving off the MUSIC.      It STOPS.      He regards Sara impatiently. \nSTERN JUDGE Are you ready now? \nBefore she can respond, Patrick's voice booms from the back of the auditorium. \nPATRICK (O.S.) Yes, sir.    She's ready. \nANGLE WIDENS to reveal him coming forward. Rushing for the stage. He pauses at the apron of it. Looks up at Sara. She peers down at him, astounded. Shaken. He smiles at her. She smiles back. Patrick's eyes softly take her in. \nPATRICK You can do it. (because) Ain't nobody watchin' you but me. \nSara's eyes focus on him.       She nods.     Turns to the judges. \n", "test1_input": "SARA Chenille.   She's ugly.   She's fat! \nCHENILLE She's twenty-one too. I ain't got all night. Let's hop. \nSARA Wait. I have to ask you something. (hard for her) Do I really look alright? \nAn unspoken thing passes between them. Chenille suddenly whips off her coat. Gestures at Sara with her head. \nCHENILLE Gimme that '89 Madonna shit.    Your jacket. Give it here. \nSara takes off the bolero. Chenille ties it around her own neck, then yanks Sara's miniskirt down around her hips. Sara's torso is clad in a long-sleeved cotton tee. Chenille frowns at it. \nSARA It's from the GAP. \nCHENILLE It's country. You look country in it. Take it off. \nSARA I'm not walking in there in my bra. \n(CONTINUED) \n74   CONTINUED:                                                  74 \nChenille thrusts her leather coat at her. Sara can't believe what she's doing, getting (un)dressed on a public street! She pulls off the tee, slips on Chenille's coat. Buttons it as far as the buttons go. Looks down. Half her chest is exposed. \n75   EXT. ALLEY (EAST BALTIMORE) - SARA AND CHENILLE - NIGHT     75 \nGaining on what looks like an abandoned warehouse. Chenille snorts at the roped off queue of kids waiting to get inside. \nCHENILLE Rope dopes.   C'mon. \nShe leads Sara to the door of FEETZ. The Sumo-sized MAN guarding it knows Chenille, digs her. His grin exposes gold-capped teeth. \nDOORMAN Chenille.    Lookin' fine.   As always. \nCHENILLE Too fine to stand in line? \nThe Man grins, opens the rope, lets them in -- \"in\" being just inside the front door. A BOUNCER there collects the $10.00 cover charge. Checks their I.D. He hands Sara's back with a smirk. \nBOUNCER Changed your hair. \nHe waves a metal detector over their bodies, nods to yet another bouncer who escorts Sara and Chenille through yet another door. \n76   ANOTHER ANGLE                                               76 \nThey march a short distance to an old elevator where a group of kids wait. Bouncer #2 engages the elevator. Everyone piles in. \n77   INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION                           77 \nSara holds onto her stomach as the CREAKY ELEVATOR descends and the MUSIC below rises. The elevator's vibrating with music. \n(CONTINUED) \n77   CONTINUED:                                                     77 \nSARA (an inside to Chenille) Can't get much more underground than this. \n78   INT. FEETZ CLUB - CONTINUOUS ACTION                            78 \nA smoky hole in the wall, filled to the brim with kids. Mostly black kids with a few whites and Latinos melting in. They share a common goal: To clog the dance floor, flaunt their outfits and get nasty with the music of the masters: Tupac Shakur, NAS, Lauryn Hill, Puff Daddy, etc. Here, the boundaries of dirty dancing are pushed, from erotic to vulgar; loving to lascivious. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nSara and Chenille. Sara's excited. She loves that she has to shout to be head over the music. \nCHENILLE Let's get our table 'fore it gets crashed and I hafta hurt somebody. \nSara's bewildered. She doesn't see any tables. She follows Chenille to the back of FEETZ. Sees six or seven tables. All of them have reserved signs. Most of them are filled. \nSARA What are you, some kind of V.I.P.? \nChenille indicates the deejay booth.     Snookie's in it. \nCHENILLE Snook hooks me up whenever he dees. \nThey walk past a SLACKER in lycra pants and a big Army shirt. He licks his tongue at Chenille, grabs at her protruding butt. She swirls around, grabs his crotch hard enough to get his attention. The Slacker is squirming in her clutch. \nSLACKER Aw'right, aw'right. You got it. \nCHENILLE Got what? (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n78   CONTINUED:                                                       78 \nCHENILLE (CONT'D) (as he can't think of anything but the squeeze on his balls) The right to walk past your greasy, tickle dick self without your paws on my ass? 'S'that how I got it? \n", "test1_true": "CHENILLE That's how I thought I had it. (a fly wave) See ya. \nShe and Sara continue on to back-of-the-club tables. Stop at a reserved one. An adjacent table sports Nikki, her three girl crew... and Diggy. All nurse drinks. Nikki snake-eyes Sara. \nNIKKI What is up with this place? Seems like they're lettin' anybody in. \nCHENILLE Yeah.   And they started with you. \nThe three girls and Diggy snicker. Nikki gives Chenille a look. Turns back to Sara with a snide smirk. Points out her crew. \nNIKKI I'm Nikki. Alyssa. Jasmin. Tiff'nee. You know Diggy, right, Marsha? \nSARA Sara. It's Sara. And I know you. We have a class together. \nNIKKI That don't mean you know me. \nCHENILLE Quit it, Nikki. \nNIKKI Quit what? I ain't walkin' on eggshells just 'cause you brought the Brady Bunch to the Negro Club. \n(CONTINUED) \n78   CONTINUED:                                                       78 \nSARA (kiss-my-ass polite) Maybe you came to the wrong spot, Nikki. I'm pretty sure this one doesn't have any Negroes. \nChenille cracks up mainly to back Sara up.       Nikki glowers at her. \nNIKKI I'm pretty sure you came with one. \nCHENILLE Oh, no. Uh-uh, wench. You did not just call me a Negro. \nAs Chenille bucks, Diggy springs up from her seat, runs her arm in the space between Chenille and Nikki like a referee. \nDIGGY Alright, y'all. Chill. \nNIKKI Tell her to chill. She always got somethin' to say. \nCHENILLE I can say a lot more. Keep runnin' your mouth, Nikki. I'll lay all your shit bare. \nWhatever shit it is, Nikki's not taking any       chances. She ejects herself from the table, walks off.        The three girls scoot loyally after her. Diggy gets        up. Sits down at Sara's and Chenille's table. Diggy goes        with the flow. That's why she always fits in. \nDIGGY Why you burn her like that? \nCHENILLE 'Cause I can't stand her ass and the way she played my brother. I need a drink, Sara. Let's walk. \n79   INT. FEETZ - ENTRANCE - SAME TIME                                79 \nPatrick and Malakai enter with two high school dropouts we will learn are ARVEL and LIP. Females flock to flirt with Patrick and Malakai, who both swell like sponges, soaking up the attention. \n80   INT. FEETZ - BAR - SAME TIME                                        80 \nChenille pushes her way to the bar, tugging Sara along. A tall, angular twenty-something MAN on the far side of the bar sees her. She sees him. Sucks her teeth, nudges Sara. \nCHENILLE That's him.        Comin' over.   Kenny? Don't look. \nSo of course Sara does. She makes a silly face at Chenille as Kenny sidles up to her. Chenille rolls her eyes half-heartedly. \nKENNY (MAN) What's up? \nCHENILLE Where's my money, Kenny? \nKENNY I'm a little short this week. Don't jump off. It's comin'. \nCHENILLE It's comin'?    No. You lyin'. \nKENNY Lemme rap to you about the situation on the dance floor. \nShe shakes her head firmly but her eyes do tell. She's in love with him. Enough to let him whisper in her ear, sweet-talk her away from the bar. Before she's swallowed up by the crowd, Chenille turns back to Sara, shouts: \nCHENILLE Rum and Coke.    No ice.   Hook me up. \nON PATRICK \nsplitting off from Malakai and a girl clinging to him. He's walking through when Nikki appears from nowhere, grabs his arm. \nNIKKI Let's dance. \nPATRICK (pulling away) Let's not. \n(CONTINUED) \n80   CONTINUED:                                                        80 \n", "test1_id": 1098, "test2_input": "SARA I wanted to get you something and I couldn't figure out what. It's not much but I hope you like it. \nPatrick opens the box. Removes a key chain. It's engraved with the medical emblem (snake & staff, etc.). He regards her, touched. \nPATRICK I like it.   I love it.    Thank you. \nSARA Wait.     There's more. \nShe leans in, turns the key chain over in his hand. The back side of it is engraved with the words, \"PATRICK REYNOLDS, M.D.\" Patrick locks eyes with Sara, lifts her hand to his lips. Kisses it softly. The gesture is succinct but alluring and, for a brief moment, they're the only two people in the world. \n118   INT./EXT. CITY BUS - SARA AND PATRICK - LATER                      118 \nThe bus makes a stop and an older white woman gets on. Sits across from Sara and Patrick who have moved even closer to each other. Patrick's arm is around Sara's shoulder. He whispers something in Sara's ear. She laughs and looks up to see the white woman staring at them with a muted but obvious repugnance. Watching the woman from the corner of her eye, Sara drapes her arms around Patrick's neck, nuzzles at his ear. Patrick's eyes widen. Sara, playing this for all it's worth, folds one of her legs between his and whispers: \nSARA We have an audience.      Work with me. \nPATRICK (nonplussed) Work with you? \nSARA (sotto voce, through her teeth) Grab something. \n(CONTINUED) \n118   CONTINUED:                                                   118 \nHe grabs her ass   -- what else is there? -- runs his hand along her side.    The white woman, thoroughly disgusted, gets up and moves   to the back of the bus. Patrick and Sara look at each   other, burst out laughing. \n119   EXT. BALTIMORE HALL - NIGHT                                  119 \nThe equivalent of D.C.'s Kennedy Center, the hall is awash in lights and activity. Men and women are donned in formal attire. Parking valets hover on the sidewalks waiting for cars. Into this, Sara and Patrick walk. She looks at the crowd, then sees the overhead banner -- \"Boston Ballet, A Command Performance.\" Sara's heart stops. Her feet freeze. Patrick looks at her. She looks positively catatonic. \nPATRICK Surprise... Sara? \nSARA (quietly urgent) I can't. I can't go in. \nPATRICK (doesn't understand) You have to go in. This is where I'm bringing you. The ballet. \nSARA (beside herself) I know, but -- \nPATRICK (crestfallen) But what? \nSara looks at him, feeling bad. Feeling stupid for ruining the evening. She bites her lip, shakes her head (\"but nothing\"). Patrick takes her and they go in. \n120   INT. BALTIMORE HALL - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT                     120 \nSara and Patrick watch the Boston Company perform Igor Stravinsky's \"Scenes De Ballet\" as choreographed by Christopher Wheeldon. They're both enraptured. But while Patrick keeps sneaking excited glimpses of Sara, her eyes remain fixed on the dancers, the dance. She is utterly, totally engaged and amazed. The yearning that never really left her returns to tug at her heart and project her soul onto the stage. \n121   EXT. STREET (SOMEWHERE IN BALTIMORE) - NIGHT                   121 \nPost-ballet, Sara and Patrick walk. She's quiet, introspective. Patrick's at a loss. He can't decipher her mood and, which is more, he's disappointed by it. \nPATRICK I thought you would like it. \nSARA I did. \nPATRICK You ain't actin' like you did. \nShe looks over at him, tries to smile. \nSARA I'm sorry. \nThey come to a small, secluded bridge.     Sara sits down on the edge of it. Patrick follows suit.      A long moment. \nSARA I don't want you to think I didn't have a good time tonight, Patrick. I did. But ballet isn't a part of my life anymore. \nPATRICK Why not? What happened? You just woke up one day and decided to waste your talent. \nSARA (without rancor) How do you know I have talent? Because I did some stupid leg trick. \nPATRICK I saw the look on your face when you did it, Sara. The same look I saw tonight. Goofy happy. So if you're gonna tell me somethin' about not dancing, at least tell me somethin' real. \nA long, difficult moment wherein Sara attempts to find the words, face the pain that comes with them. Finally, she looks at him. \nSARA Maybe I don't want it to be real. \n(CONTINUED) \n121   CONTINUED:                                                    121 \nShe stares out at the water, the moon reflected off of it. It's hard to reconcile that beauty and the turmoil she's feeling. But she goes on. \nSARA What I want is to wake up and see my mom. For things to go back to the way they were. When they made sense. When my life made sense. (because) And it's all my fault. She got scraped off the highway for me, for my fucking audition. She was rushing. It was raining. It was raining... (a torrent) ... But she promised to be there. I made her promise. And then I didn't wait for her. I should have but they called my name and I didn't say anything. I just went out and danced. I was mad. I needed her and she wasn't there. \nShe buries her face in her hands, breaking down, racked with tears and guilt. Patrick puts his arms around her. \nSARA (inconsolable) She was dying while I was dancing and I was mad at her and I'm sorry. I'm sorry... \n", "test2_true": "Sara, choking on tears, regards him forlornly. \nSARA That's what makes it so bad. She always did what was right for me. I wanted to be a prima ballerina -- had to be. Even if it took most of our money, all of her spare time. I didn't care. It was my stupid dream and it killed her. All she wanted was for it to come true. \n(CONTINUED) \n121   CONTINUED:                                                  121 \nPATRICK You still got whatever you had when your mom was alive, Sara. She wouldn't want you to give up. \nSara swipes at her face, looks up at him, still crying. \nSARA I know... but she... I just don't think I can do it without her. \nPATRICK (holding her) Do you want to do it, Sara? I mean you. Do you want Juilliard? \nSARA Yeah.   I do. \nPATRICK Then it's on you to make the dream come true. \nSARA Yeah.   For my mom. \nPATRICK For her.   For you. \n122   EXT. ROY'S APARTMENT/STREET - THAT NIGHT                    122 \nPatrick walks Sara to the front door. They pause on the stoop. Neither of them wants the night to end. \nSARA See you tomorrow? \nA rhetorical question under the circumstances. Patrick regards her tenderly, moves her hair from her eyes. Stares deeply into them. Sara smiles wanly, certain she looks like shit. But it doesn't matter. The moment has named itself. And so, with more certainty than passion, they kiss. \n123   INT. SARA'S ROOM - NIGHT                                    123 \nCAMERA PANS the room, PICKING UP small touches from Sara's past life, her previous bedroom -- more on display than we've seen before. HOLD ON closet door. A beat before Sara emerges from behind it, ballet slippers in hand. She takes a deep breath. Slides them on. Peers down at her feet. Wiggles them. Nothing magical or mystical but simply wonderful. Gleefully wonderful. Like the end of a long day's journey to home. \n124   EXT. INNER HARBOR COMPLEX   (DOWNTOWN BALTIMORE) - DAY         124 \nSara and Patrick negotiate the heavy pedestrian traffic, exit the complex. He leads her to a mall of trees and bike paths. \nPATRICK Lemme see that move you did.     That cute leg relieve thing. (as she shakes her head) Come on, Sara. \nSARA (hates to admit this) It hurts! I'm out of shape and it hurts. Okay? Satisfied? \nPATRICK (admiring her) That's what you call outta shape, what's it take to get you in shape? \nSARA Practice. \nPATRICK This is the perfect spot for that. You can run around and I can sit under the trees and watch you. \nSARA I don't get in shape like that. But it's still a good spot. (diffidently) I got my application for Juilliard. Just in time too. They're holding auditions in Baltimore next month. \nPATRICK That's great! \nShe looks at him, shakes her head.   Not that great. \nSARA I'll never be ready in a month. \nPATRICK Sara, you puttin' the mojo on yourself. \n(CONTINUED) \n124   CONTINUED:                                                       124 \nSARA (a smile in spite of herself) Mojo? \nPATRICK Negative shit. White folks call it karma. The bad kind. \nSARA You don't understand. Ballet takes a lot of time, a lot of preparation. I used to practice two, three hours every day. I'm so far behind... \n... And unsure and afraid. Which Patrick can sense.        But he won't let her go there or stay there. He's firm, matter-of-fact. \nPATRICK Quit whinin' and catch up then. \nSARA It's not as easy as that. My free form still sucks. It's still the weakest part of my routine. That hasn't changed. \nPATRICK So I'll help you with it. \nSARA You will? \nPATRICK (surprised that she's surprised) Yeah. I'll help you. Tell me what you need to do and let's get busy. \nMONTAGE SEQUENCE \n", "test2_id": 1099, "test3_input": "PATRICK That shit ain't funny. \nSNOOKIE (springing up) Damn right it ain't funny. \nMALAKAI I thought you liked it down there. That's your specialty, ain't it? Crawling? \nSNOOKIE That was a reflex action, man. And you just plain rude and wrong to bring the shit up in mixed company. \nSara's not quite sure what they're alluding to but she doesn't want the displeasure of Malakai's company. She taps Patrick. \nSARA I gotta get home. Ready? \nMalakai's eyes slice into her. First Snookie, now this bitch. Steppin' all over his conversation with Patrick. \nMALAKAI No, he ain't ready. He's talkin'. To me. A-B conversation. Gotta go? C yourself the fuck home. \nSARA (a real reflex action) Fuck you. \nMalakai lunges for her. The move is so swift and sudden Patrick overturns his stool to dive between them. He sweeps Sara behind him, into the path of a startled \nSnookie. Stands there nose-to-nose with Malakai, staring him down, furious with him. \nPATRICK Have you lost your motherfuckin' MIND, man? Huh? Have you! \nSara, frightened and frozen, doesn't know what to do. Snookie's voice weakly creaks out. He's trying to rise to the occasion. \nSNOOKIE Patrick, man, c'mon. \nBut Malakai and Patrick stay where they stand. Too close for comfort. Both in the danger zone. Malakai regards Patrick with a combination of cruel anger and deep, genuine hurt. \nMALAKAI You take that bitch's back and won't even cover mine? \nPATRICK 'Cause you wrong, Malakai! \nMALAKAI No! You wrong. You BEEN wrong. You ain't worth shit no more. (venomously) Get out my face, and take that ho with you. \nPatrick bucks up. Sara walks over to him, gently clutches his sleeve. It's no easier to turn away from Malakai than it is to walk away from a lifetime of friendship. But Patrick does. With Sara holding onto his arm, at his side, he turns and walks away. \n158   EXT. STREET - SARA AND PATRICK - NIGHT                     158 \nwalking. A heavy silence. Sara looks over at him. Patrick doesn't say anything. But after a moment, he reaches down and takes her hand and they walk on like this together. \nOVER MUSIC (e.g. BUSTA RHYMES' \"Dangerous.\") \n159   INT. DANCE STUDIO - SARA AND PATRICK - MORNING             159 \nPractice her free form, a hip-hop ballet hybrid. They're both tired, irritable, beaten down. They've been there awhile. Sara makes a misstep. Patrick stops. Cold. Sara grits on him. \n(CONTINUED) \n159   CONTINUED:                                                          159 \nSARA We should keep going. \nPATRICK You messed up. \nSARA I know I messed up. I'll get it right the next time. \nPATRICK No. You gonna get it right now so you can do it perfect next time. \nShe glares at him, exasperated.         So many things bottled up. \nSARA I can't work like this.      I can't dance like this. \nPATRICK Like what? \nSARA Like this.     You dictating to me. \nHe crosses the room, CUTS OFF the MUSIC. Looks at her. Sara walks over to a window seat near him. Flops down. \nPATRICK What's wrong, Sara? \nSARA Nothing's wrong. (except) I can't figure things out. \nPATRICK What things? The audition? You ain't got nothin' to worry about. I told you. I'll be there. \nSARA Things, Patrick. Things between us. Things between us and them. \nPATRICK I didn't know there was a 'them.' \nSARA Well, open your pretty brown eyes, look the hell around.

Now she's getting mad. \nSARA You're never gonna run your own life as long as you keep running back to Malakai every time he fucks up or fucks you over. \nShe's crossed the line. But Patrick responds so deliberately, so calmly prosaic, that she doesn't immediately realize it... \nPATRICK First of all, Malakai ain't never fucked me over. Second of all, you don't know him, Sara, what he been through. Matter of fact, you don't know shit about none of it. So don't come off to me like you do. \n(CONTINUED) \n159   CONTINUED:                                                       159 \nSARA I know he's lost, Patrick! Everybody but you can see that. And if you keep reaching back for him, you're gonna wind up lost too. \n... until he erupts. \nPATRICK Who the fuck are you to say he's lost?

The hell with you. \nSara yells after him.     Her VOICE ECHOES in the empty studio. \nSARA The hell with you too! \n160   EXT. PATTERSON HIGH - HALLWAY OUTSIDE SARA'S CLASSROOM - 160 DAY \nSara exits, looking pretty much like she feels. Like shit. She walks a few paces. Sees Patrick. Their eyes connect for a brief, awful moment before they continue on their respective ways. \n161   INT. PATTERSON HIGH - SARA'S LOCKER/HALLWAY -                    161 LATER THAT DAY \nSara's at her locker. Patrick walks up to her. She looks at him, tries to smile past the dour expression on his face. \nSARA Hi. \nPatrick doesn't say anything at first.       But then: \n(CONTINUED) \n161   CONTINUED:                                                    161 \nPATRICK Thought you might need this on Saturday. I ain't gonna be able to make it. \nHe hands her an audio cassette of her free form music. Sara gazes at it, then up at him, understanding what this means. She won't let him see how it shatters her. He hesitates, as if he wants to say something else. But Sara turns her back on him and Patrick walks away. \nANOTHER ANGLE - TONI \napproaching Sara's locker. Having seen the encounter between Patrick and Sara, she's as smug and overbearing as ever. \nTONI Lovers' quarrel? You're better off. That menace to society would've broken your heart and spent all your money in a news flash. Trust me on that, Sara. \nSara stares at her, uncomprehending at first. She resists the urge to slap the smile off Toni's face.   She gets in it instead. \nSARA Toni, listen carefully. You're a simple bitch and you don't have any friends, black or white, because nobody likes a fucking asshole. \nShe storms off leaving Toni, for once, speechless. \n162   INT. PATTERSON HIGH - HALLWAY/CAFETERIA - DAY                 162 \nSara. Caught up in a throng of kids and    somehow very separate from them. The walls have been    transformed into veritable billboards for the senior prom   -- decorations are everywhere. Sara continues down the    hallway almost aimlessly into the... \n163   INT. CAFETERIA - CONTINUOUS ACTION                            163 \nSara. Carrying a food tray, eyes searching for a place to sit. She picks up Chenille and her girls at one table... Nikki and her crew at another... Patrick and Snookie... and, finally, Toni. Sara dumps her food into a trash can, walks out. \n164   INT. DANCE STUDIO - DAY                                       164 \nSara. Alone. She pushes the tape from Patrick into an ancient recorder. The MUSIC COMES ON. She takes to the floor.

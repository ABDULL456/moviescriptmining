{"test1_input": "14   FLASHBACK - INT. UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA - WAITING        14 ROOM - DAY \nSara, in costume, flips through a magazine. She taps her toes, checks her watch. A phalanx of parents and dancers are clustered around a sign posted on the door: JUILLIARD SCHOOL OF DANCE AUDITIONS. Sara stares at it. Re-checks her watch. An official with a clipboard walks toward her. Where's her mother? \n15   INT. UNIV. OF PENNSYLVANIA - STAGE/AUDITORIUM -              15 MOMENTS LATER \nSara on stage. She looks past a row of Juilliard JUDGES into the audience. No glint of gold. MOZART'S \"Elvira Madigan\" (Andante) CUES UP. Sara begins her technical. She transforms her nervousness into a notable, powerful performance. The Judges are mutely but clearly impressed. One of them looks directly at her. \n(CONTINUED) \n15   CONTINUED:                                                  15 \nJUDGE Is there anything you'd like to share about your free form before you begin? A motif... a theme? \nSara's stomach drops to her feet. Her mother's not there and her free form sucks and she doesn't have a theme. Shit! \nSARA Well, it's um, pretty self- explanatory. The theme. \nThe Judges exchange a look. New MUSIC CUES UP. Some driving, CLASSICAL NUMBER.   Sara tries to elevate her body above the music, but she's nervous, unsure on her feet. She keeps glancing in the back of the auditorium for Glynn. Searching for her port in the storm. Wondering where her mother is and knowing how badly she's dancing. Knowing but somehow continuing, stumbling, recovering, and finally finishing with those damned knocking knees. The Judges, eyes like stones, perfunctorily nod. Their equivalent of maybe next year. Sara chokes two words out... \nSARA Thank you. \n16   INT. AUDITORIUM - BACKSTAGE \n... Rushes backstage. Fighting tears, she hurries past waiting dancers angrily unhooking the clover leaf chain from her neck. \n17   INT. DRESSING ROOM - DAY                                    17 \nSara in street clothes. Cramming her ballet gear into a duffle bag when the official (of the clipboard) approaches her. She touches Sara's shoulder gently. Says something we do not hear. \n18   INT. OFFICE (UNIV. OF PA) - CONTINUOUS ACTION               18 \nSHOOTING THROUGH office window. A state trooper in a rain slicker offers Sara a chair. She sits. The trooper talks. As he does, dread and disbelief spread over Sara's face. She shakes her head, attempts to stand. Her legs buckle beneath her. The trooper and the official catch her as she falls. \n19   EXT.

AMTRAK TRAIN - NIGHT                                   27 \nSara. Holding her breath, clenching her fists. Waiting for the sound to stop, oblivious to the stare of the Woman beside her. \n28   EXT. PENN STATION (BALTIMORE) - PLATFORM - NIGHT            28 \nROY JOHNSON, 37, a handsome, laconic man of uncertain style, takes a last drag from his cigarette, drops and stomps it. Passengers disembark from the train. Roy searches their faces. They all look like strangers. \n29   EXT. AMTRAK TRAIN - SAME TIME                               29 \nA conductor helps Sara to the platform. Steam from the train's engine is sucked into the fog. She walks through it. Sees him. They see each other. Roy weakly waves. Walks toward her. Sara watches his bow legs stiffly advance. She wants to run. Can't. \nROY Hi. \nSARA Hi. \nROY Have a good ride? \nSara self-consciously tucks her hair behind an ear. \n", "test1_true": "A beat.   Roy looks at her. \nROY Guess you got stuff.

I wouldn't have if you hadn't asked me to go. I mean, I could've hung around. Helped you say good-bye. That's what you were doin', wasn't it? \nSARA Uh-huh. \nRoy takes another drag, nods thoughtfully to himself. \nROY That's what I figured you were doin'. \nSara peers out    the windshield. Baltimore City. The neighborhoods    are changing. The streets are getting progressively    gritty and dirty. It surprises her. It worries her.     Roy worries her. \nROY Look. Sara. I feel bad too. I mean, we both got hit by the same bolt of lightning. You don't have to pretend this is easy. (off nothing) Everything's upside down right now but don't worry. We'll work this bachelor-father thing out. Hell, it ain't like we're movin' in with strangers. We got a pretty good idea about each other, right? \nSara looks askance at him, her expression indicating otherwise. A moment. Roy's too new at this to hold up both ends of the conversation. The silence deepens. Roy switches on the radio. \n31   EXT. BOND STREET (SOUTH BALTIMORE) - NIGHT                  31 \nRoy's truck pulls up to a string of disrepaired rowhouses with pristine white marble steps. He and Sara each lug a suitcase from the truck. Her eyes wander up and down the street. They're on the fringes of a ghetto. A few people roost on their stoops, hang on the corners. All of them have black faces. \nSARA Thought you were moving to Fells Point. \nROY Fell through. \n32   INT. ROY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                  32 \nThe second floor of a two-story house has been turned into a one-bedroom studio. A partition separates the living area from the bedroom. Sara walks past a collection of saxophones and several framed pictures of herself. Aside from the saxophones and the pictures, there's hardly any furniture. Roy lights a cigarette. \nROY Not much of what you're used to. But the water's hot and the fridge is full. And I made room in the closets for you. Girl's gotta have closets, right? You even get your own bed. I'll crash on the couch. \nSARA You bought a bed? \nROY (slight bow) Pardon me. Your own futon.     Check it out. On the other side. \nSuitcase in hand, Sara walks around the partition. Her \"room\" is an old futon, an ancient set of drawers. She stands in the middle of nothing, wanting something to do. She removes framed photos of Glynn from her backpack, places them around the room. \n33   INT. ROY'S APARTMENT - LIVING AREA - MINUTES LATER            33 \nSara walks in.   Doesn't see Roy.   Calls out. \nSARA Do you have a phone? \nRoy emerges from the bathroom drying his hands, walks past her. \nROY Of course I have a phone. \nSARA You didn't at the last place.    The last place I saw anyway. \nROY Things change. You've changed. You grew up on me. Overnight. \n(CONTINUED) \n33   CONTINUED:                                                     33 \nSARA Over the summer. You blew me off for some gig on the road, remember? (before he can respond) Can I call Lindsay? Let her know I got here alright. \nROY Are you alright, Sara? (off the scowl in her eyes) I just wanna know how you feel. \nSARA I feel fine.     I feel like calling Lindsay. \nShe's a wall. A brick wall. Roy's head aches from knocking into it. He goes to the couch. Drops down. Mutters at her. \nROY Phone's in the kitchen.   Knock yourself out. \n34   INT. SARA'S ROOM/BATHROOM - LATE THAT NIGHT                    34 \n", "test1_id": 1098, "test2_input": "MALAKAI Business. \nShort-hand. Patrick understands it, nods.

PATTERSON HIGH - THAT DAY (AFTER SCHOOL)                 55 \nSara exits with Chenille. A CAR HORN starts to blare. Both of them ignore it. But it goes on like a musical number. Sara gets a sinking feeling that drops like a stone when she looks across the street. Roy's parked at the curb, waiting for her. She rolls her eyes and he HONKS AGAIN. Then he waves at her. Waves! Chenille looks at Sara. Then at Roy. \nCHENILLE That's your old man? Now he's cute. \nSARA He's embarrassing. \nCHENILLE (laughs) Yeah.   He is. For you. \n56   INT./EXT. ROY'S TRUCK - CONTINUOUS ACTION                     56 \nSara climbs in, slams the door. Roy looks over at her, unaware of how annoyed she is with him. She's a clenched fist inside. \nROY How'd it go? \nSARA Fine. (as he pulls off) Tomorrow I catch the bus. \n57   INT. ROY'S APARTMENT - SARA'S \"ROOM\" - NIGHT                  57 \nSara's moving the partition around, trying to make her room more like a room. Trying to build another wall between her and Roy. \n(CONTINUED) \n57   CONTINUED:                                                       57 \nROY (O.S.) Hey, Sara.   C'mere a minute. \nSara lets out a heavy sigh.        What does he want? \nSARA What? \nROY (O.S.) Just come here. \nShe walks into the kitchen. Roy's in front of the open freezer door. Grinning from ear to ear. He motions her over. Sara crosses to the freezer. Looks inside. \nINSERT - INSIDE FREEZER \nIt's full of frozen dinners.       They're in unruly, lopsided stacks. \nBACK TO SCENE \nRoy regards her expectantly. \nROY Hungry and Healthys. I asked at the market. They're the best. So. What do you feel like? (whimsically) Lamb Chop Suey? Tropical Tuna? Primavera Paradise? \nSARA I had a big lunch. \nRoy, deflated, closes the freezer door, trails her into the living area. Sara's clenching again. There's no escaping him. \nROY What do you wanna do? You wanna hang out with me? Go to my gig. You can if you want. \nSARA It's a school night, Roy. \nROY Right.   School night.    Got it. \n58   INT. ROY'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - SARA - LATER            58 \nRoy's gone. Sara takes her first good look around. A mess. It drives home where she is. What she's lost. It's overwhelming. \n59   INT. ROY'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - CLOSE ON EMPTY T.V.         59 DINNER TRAY - NIGHT \nAn empty beer bottle, one askew kitchen chair. Vestiges of Roy's meal. ANGLE WIDENS as Sara enters. She opens the freezer to unearth a dinner and starts an avalanche of falling food. A box of Sugar Puffs cereal lands at her feet. Something else out of place. She picks it up, jams everything back into the freezer. Slams the door shut. \n", "test2_true": "60   SARA                                                         60 \nin a whirlwind, cleaning the apartment. Wall to wall. Scrubbing away what's churned up inside. The dervish ends in her \"room,\" where she finishes unpacking. Several layers into a suitcase, she comes to her ballet shoes. The sight hits her like a slap in the face. Sara stares at the shoes until her eyes blur. Then she snatches them up and entombs them deep inside her closet. \n61   EXT. O'DONNELL HEIGHTS PUBLIC HOUSING PROJECTS -             61 MORNING \nPatrick, Chenille, Snookie straggle through the dreary jungle of concrete lawns and blighted high rises on the way to school. It's quiet now but the scars of past battles, like the bombed out police substation on one of its corners, are evident everywhere. \nSNOOKIE I need a date -- \nCHENILLE Why?   Your hand busy? \nSNOOKIE -- For the prom. And if it wasn't for that kinda undue attitude, you could be the lucky girl, Chenille. My personal prom queen.

You large, man. \nPATRICK I ain't gonna be doctor nothin' if I don't get in and I'm not in 'til I get my letter. \nCHENILLE It's in the mail, Patrick.       Okay? \nSNOOKIE (wishfully thinking) I probably coulda been a doctor too. If I hadn't got left back that time. \nCHENILLE That time? What? Fifth and sixth grade don't count? \nPatrick finally laughs. Then his face changes. Becomes serious. He hops a low wall, keeps in stride above them. They continue on like this, the ruins of their world in the b.g. behind them. \n62   INT./EXT CITY BUS/BALTIMORE STREETS - MORNING                  62 \nThe bus is crammed with kids. Sara, seated by a window, doesn't bother looking out. Inside's more interesting. The kids cut up. Singing, rapping, and jousting with each other. Some even manage to read. Sara watches with immunity. She's invisible to them. \n63   EXT. BUS STOP (NEAR PATTERSON HIGH) - MORNING                  63 \nSara alights just as Patrick, Chenille, and Snookie walk past.

HALLWAY NEAR ENTRANCE (PATTERSON HIGH) -                 64 CONTINUOUS ACTION \nPatrick and Chenille pass through metal detectors, watch Snookie clown his way through. The security guard shakes his head. All three begin to walk. Snookie, bobbing and jiving, doesn't see Mrs. Gwynn coming up from behind. Her voice stops him cold. \nMRS. GWYNN (as Patrick and Chenille look on) Light on your feet? Good. Be sure they dance into my office next week. \nShe moseys on.   Snookie regards Patrick's smile, shakes his head. \n65   INT. CHEMISTRY LAB - LATER THAT MORNING                       65 \nThe class has donned lab coats and is ready   to begin when Sarah rushes in. She tries to slink into a    seat. The teacher, MR. HILL, gives her a disapproving   look, points at one of several formulas (C2,H6,O2) on the   blackboard. Sara just looks at him \nMR. HILL We're cooking today, Ms. Johnson. This is your first lab. You'll need a partner. Mr. Reynolds -- Patrick -- will show you the ropes. \nPatrick bounces a smile off unsettled Sara.     This should be fun. \n66   INT.

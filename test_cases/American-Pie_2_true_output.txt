OZ You talked to Stifler? 
HEATHER Well...I needed to find you.  We are gonna have to practice that song. 
OZ ...okay.  Cool then.  I'm um, I'm glad you came by.  I mean, really. 
She smiles.  Oz lets her in. 
HEATHER So you like, work nights? 
An uncomfortable moment for Oz. 
OZ Uh...my dad's the manager. 
HEATHER Really?  Cool.  Tell him his subs are great. 
OZ Ah, he's always too heavy on the vinegar.  If you really want a good one, you gotta let me make it. 
INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER 
Oz is behind the counter.  Heather walks down the other side as Oz assembles a sub. 
OZ My dad's always here running the store, busy and stuff...and I fill in once a week so he can get a night off. 
HEATHER (pause) That's nice. 
OZ (shrugs) So you're going to Michigan? 
HEATHER Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern.  I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?  So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it. 
OZ Onions? 
HEATHER What? 
OZ You want onions? 
HEATHER Oh, yeah.  So what're you gonna major in? 
OZ Well, State's got a good business school.  And I can probably walk onto the lacrosse team.  Green peppers? 
HEATHER Yeah.  So wow, you've got it figured out. 
OZ (dismissive) Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  I really have no idea. 
HEATHER Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one. 
OZ Well, you're not.  Oil and vinegar? 
HEATHER Yeah.  You know, people are always like, "What're you gonna major in?" And I don't know.  And they're like, "You'll figure it out."  Yeah?  When? 
OZ I know.  Salt and pepper? 
HEATHER Sure. 
Oz cuts the sub in half with a flourish and puts it on a tray. 
HEATHER (CONT'D) So we're gonna be close next year? 
OZ You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor. 
HEATHER (smiles) ...yeah. 
A beat...a little uncomfortable, but nice. 
OZ Wanna swap your chips for cookies? 
EXT. SUBWAY - NIGHT - LATER 
The remains of a couple subs are on a table.  Oz and Heather are doing their song...it's rough, but they're working through it.  And when they're in sync, they sound really good together.  We SLOWLY PULL BACK as they sing into the night. 
INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - MURAL STAIRCASE - DAY 
A GIRL HOLDING OUT FOR FINCH talks to Stifler. 
GIRL HOLDING OUT FOR FINCH I'm sorry, I really can't go with you...I'm holding out for someone else. 
STIFLER You gotta be fucking kidding. 
GIRL HOLDING OUT FOR FINCH I know it's a long shot, but I figure Paul Finch might ask me. 
STIFLER FINCH?  SHITBREAK?!! 
GIRL HOLDING OUT FOR FINCH Oh gosh, I forgot -- you uh, you look okay...I mean you can't even tell... 
Flustered, she heads down the stairs.  Stifler, entirely confused, heads off into the second floor.  As the Girl Holding Out For Finch descends, Kevin catches up with her.

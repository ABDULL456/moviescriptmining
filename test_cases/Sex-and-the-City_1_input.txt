92   EXT. MEXICAN RESORT/ROAD -- SUNSET                           92 
A lush tropical road with a view of the sun setting on the ocean. A large open air GOLF CART comes around the bend holding the girls. Carrie's hair blows in the breeze, her sunglasses firmly in place. 
93   EXT. MEXICAN RESORT/HOUSE -- A LITTLE LATER                  93 
A gorgeous romantic private house surrounded by tropical splendor. The cart arrives in front. The DOORS are open and PAULO (38) the BUTLER stands there holding a tray with two beautiful tropical drinks. He is surprised when he sees the four women, but he covers, effortlessly. 
PAULO Welcome to Mexico. 
SAMANTHA Buenos dias. 
Carrie gets out of the cart and goes into the house -- followed by Charlotte and Miranda. Samantha arrives and picks up a drink off the tray. 
PAULO I'm sorry. I am confused. I am waiting for a Mr. And Mrs. Preston. 
SAMANTHA Honey, you'll be waiting for a long time. 
She sips the drink, then looks at him, "familiar." 
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) We'll talk. 
94   INT. MEXICAN RESORT HOUSE/MAIN ROOM -- CONTINUOUS          94 
Charlotte and Miranda stand looking at the gorgeous, romantic private Mexican bungalow. Samantha enters; looks. 
SAMANTHA This... will kill her. (beat) Where is she? 
CHARLOTTE In the powder room. 
95   INT. MEXICAN RESORT HOUSE/POWDER ROOM -- CONTINUOUS        95 
Carrie stands looking in the mirror. She takes off her sunglasses. Her eyes are red, red, red. She splashes water on her face and looks at herself in the beautiful Mexican mirror. 
96   INT. MEXICAN RESORT HOUSE/MASTER BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER 96 
Paulo leads Miranda, Charlotte, and Samantha into the romantic bedroom suite. On the bed -- rose petals are scattered in the shape of a large heart. 
MIRANDA Oh My God! 
Miranda and Charlotte quickly grab the bed cover and jerk it up -- throwing all the rose petals off. Paulo watches. Miranda addresses him in a very intense WHISPER. 
MIRANDA (CONT'D) No more honeymoon stuff. This is very important. Have I made myself clear? 
97   INT. MEXICAN RESORT HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS                    97 
Carrie exits the powder room, her sunglasses in her hand. She stands in the entry way; alone. She looks out at the main room; the beautiful view, the romance. Her eyes start to water. A PORTER enters with the bags. Carrie hides her face, acknowledging him with a nod. 
98    INT. MEXICAN RESORT HOUSE/MASTER BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS       98 
Carrie enters and moves directly to the bed, past Charlotte where Miranda is sitting talking on her cell. 
MIRANDA Magda -- I'll talk to you tomorrow 
Miranda hangs up as Carrie crawls onto the bed and lays down. The pink sunset light floods across her face. 
SAMANTHA Well, it's a gorgeous sunset. 
CARRIE Close the shutters. 
Paulo moves over to the window and starts closing the shutters. The sun is slowly shuttered out. 
CARRIE (CONT'D) All of them. 
Carrie closes her eyes. DARKNESS falls across her face. 
99    INT. MEXICAN RESORT HOUSE/MASTER BEDROOM -- MORNING          99 
The room is dark except for the bright sunlight straining to get in between the cracks of the closed shutters. Carrie is asleep. Miranda sits on the bed. Carrie stirs, half waking... Miranda smiles. 
MIRANDA Morning. 
CARRIE Did I dream it? 
Miranda shakes her head, no. Carrie closes her eyes, falls back asleep. 
100   INT. MEXICAN RESORT HOUSE/MASTER BEDROOM -- DUSK           100 
Dark. Carrie is still asleep. Charlotte sits on the bed. She gently shakes Carrie. Carrie opens her eyes. 
CHARLOTTE Carrie, it's dinner time. You slept the whole day. 
CARRIE So? 
Carrie closes her eyes. Charlotte exhales, concerned. 
101   INT. MEXICAN RESORT HOUSE/MASTER BEDROOM -- MORNING         101 
A "tingling of glass" sound wakes Carrie. She opens her eyes and looks. Samantha is just sitting on the bed with a breakfast tray. 
SAMANTHA Honey, you have to eat a little breakfast. 
CARRIE I'm tired. 
SAMANTHA Eat something and you can go back to sleep. 
Samantha holds up a bowl of yogurt. Carrie adjusts on her pillows a little. Samantha feeds Carrie a spoonful of yogurt. Carrie looks at her. Samantha nods. 
102   EXT. MEXICAN RESORT HOUSE/PATIO -- LATER                    102 
Samantha, Miranda and Charlotte are sitting having lunch. Charlotte opens a pre-packaged "snack pack" chocolate pudding. She peels the lid off, takes a spoon and starts eating. 
SAMANTHA With all this gorgeous fresh food you're just going to eat that pudding crap the entire trip? 
CHARLOTTE It's the only thing in the pantry that's totally safe. (holding up lid) See. Made in Poughkeepsie. I don't want to chance it. 
MIRANDA It's a five-star resort. 
CHARLOTTE It's Mexico. 
The bedroom door opens. Carrie walks out. The sun hits her eyes. She squints. 
CHARLOTTE (CONT'D) Carrie! 
CARRIE Is there coffee? 
103   EXT. MEXICAN RESORT HOUSE/PATIO -- LATER                  103 
All four girls are laying in the sun in bathing suits reading magazines. Miranda re-adjusts her body, stretching out on her beach chair. 
MIRANDA The sun feels nice. 
Samantha looks over at her and notices something. 
SAMANTHA Jesus, honey. Wax much? 
Miranda looks up at Samantha. Samantha indicates her swimsuit crotch area...which is badly in need of a wax. Miranda grabs her towel and covers her crotch area.

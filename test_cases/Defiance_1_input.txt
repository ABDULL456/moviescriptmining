88 THE NOVEMBER WIND WHISTLES THROUGH THE BARE FOREST (MONTAGE) 88 as the group trudges along -- weighed down by cooking gear, food, guns, etc. Asael takes the iron cauldron from Chaya. Zus and Bella walk side-by-side. Pinchas leads his goat. 
MALBIN Where is he taking us? My feet are going to fall off. 
SHIMON A great rabbi once said, "wherever I go, I am always going to the land of Israel." 
MALBIN Well, maybe rabbis should give better directions. Tuvia walks alongside but apart. 
CUT TO: 
89 A HILLSIDE 89 The group is sprawled on the ground. Four people share a single cigarette. Shimon and Malbin hardly have the energy to argue. Pinchas feeds his goat. Tuvia walks among them. 
TUVIA Rest and eat. I need volunteers for a scouting party. Zus raises his hand. Tuvia nods in grudging gratitude. However mixed his feelings, Zus can always be counted on. 
CUT TO: 
90 A FORK IN THE TRAIL 90 Tuvia looks at Zus, who shrugs. They are in unfamiliar territory. As they move cautiously forward: 
A MAN IN A RED ARMY TUNIC steps into the path, holding an automatic rifle. He WHISTLES softly. More ARMED MEN materialize, surrounding them. 
GRAMOV (in Russian; subtitles) 
WHO ARE YOU? Tuvia instantly grasps the situation. He salutes. 
TUVIA (in Russian; subtitles) A brigade of independent fighters searching for our comrades. 
(CONTINUED) 
CHERRY Revision - 9-2-07 52A. 
90 CONTINUED: 90 Zus almost does a double-take at Tuvia's bluff. 
GRAMOV What brigade? 
(CONTINUED) 
YELLOW Revision - 7-30-07 53. 
90 CONTINUED: (2) 90 
TUVIA We belong to the Bielski otriad. 
GRAMOV We know of you. Jewish bandits. Zus's finger tightens on the trigger of his submachine gun. 
ZUS I'll take the two on the left... Tuvia maintains his composure. 
TUVIA I'm sure we can clear up this misunderstanding with your commander. 
CUT TO: 
91 THE OCTOBER OTRIAD BASE 91 A primitive tent camp. RUSSIAN PARTISANS move about, quiet and cold-eyed men wearing remnants of Red Army uniforms. Zus can't help but be impressed by the array of weaponry. VICTOR PACHENKO emerges from a tent. A former lieutenant, dashing in a fur cap and long officer's coat. He addresses them in Russian. 
VIKTOR I am Viktor Panchenko, commander of the October otriad. We have had complaints of a Jewish gang stealing from villages loyal to us. (a steely look) How do you respond to these charges? 
TUVIA When you take food it is from loyal supporters. When we do, you call it stealing. 
VIKTOR We are soldiers. 
TUVIA And we fight a common enemy. The motherland doesn't distinguish between Jews and non-Jews. Viktor is amused by this bit of Soviet dogma. 
VIKTOR But Jews do not fight. 
(CONTINUED) 
DOUBLE GREEN Revision - 10-14-07 54. 
91 CONTINUED: 91 
TUVIA These Jews do. Viktor appraises Tuvia for a moment. 
VIKTOR We will see. Select your best fighters and send them to us. Zus looks at Tuvia, knowing he has no choice. 
TUVIA We are honored to be of service. Tuvia and Zus SALUTE and head back the way they came. 
ZUS (under his breath) So we're partisans now. 
TUVIA As if we have a choice. 
CUT TO: 
91A NEW CAMP (CAMP #2) 91A Has taken root. People hard at work building zemylanka. 
92 THE NEW CAMP (CAMP #2) 92 Tuvia and Malbin are working together on a new bunker. Malbin expertly nails a header across a doorway. 
TUVIA (throwing a smaller 
HAMMER) Here. 
MALBIN If my friends at The New Socialists' Club could see me now... (shakes his head) I haven't read a book in months.

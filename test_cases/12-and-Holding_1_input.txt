LEONARD It feels gross. Like there's a film on my tongue. 
The nurse grabs the tray of food. She removes an untouched apple and places it in Leonard's hand. 
LEONARD (CONT'D) (cont'd) I don't like apples. 
NURSE So, you can't taste it, right? Maybe you'll like the crunch. 
The nurse exits. Leonard eyes the apple in his hand. A beat. He reluctantly takes a bite. The apple makes a loud CRUNCH. Leonard starts chewing. After a few seconds, a smile comes to his face. He likes it. 
INT. JACOB'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME 
Jacob lies in bed, holding Rudy's old baseball GLOVE. He brings the glove to his nose, and a flood of old memories come back to him. 
Jacob rises, crosses over to the closet and removes a metal LOCK BOX. He selects 666 for the combination and the box opens. Jacob removes the contents; baseball cards, some firecrackers, a few ticket stubs and a PHOTOGRAPH of he and Rudy at age 5. He can't help but smile. 
INT. JACOB'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME 
Gabe Artunian crosses over to Jim. 
GABE I'm leaving, Jim.    Again, so sorry. 
As Gabe turns to leave. 
JIM Gabe, are you still interested in buying the land? Because I accept your offer. 
GABE This is hardly the time to talk business. 
JIM Buy the woods, Gabe, please. Tear them down and build. Build houses, condos, a 7-11, I don't care. I just don't want to recognize it ever again. 
Off Gabe's look - 
SFX OVER SHOT: BUZZING CHAIN SAW 
SMASH CUT TO: 
EXT. WOODS - THREE WEEKS LATER -AFTERNOON 
TIGHT ON a CHAIN SAW chopping down a tree. 
WIDEN to REVEAL a CONSTRUCTION CREW, tearing down the last of the woods. Rows and rows of STUMPS make it look like a graveyard for trees. 
MALEE (O.S.) It's gone!     It's all gone! 
We FIND Malee and Jacob, straddling their bikes a few feet away from the site. Leonard is beside them on a scooter. He as a band-aid on his forehead. 
MALEE (CONT'D) (cont'd) If Rudy was alive, he'd be freaking out right now. 
Leonard shoots Malee a look.    She silences herself. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LEONARD You holding up alright, Jacob? 
Jacob shrugs. 
LEONARD (CONT'D) (cont'd) I'm sorry. I wish I could have done something. 
JACOB Jeff and Kenny were the ones that started the fire. It was their fault. Or maybe mine. I should of been there. 
MALEE You wouldn't have been able to do anything. And it could have been you who died. 
JACOB I wish it was. You know the last thing Rudy said to me? He said, I can't be a pussy all my life. He was right, I am. And Rudy might be dead because of it. 
MALEE Don't say that. (beat) Why don't you talk to your parents about this? 
JACOB They can't help me. 
MALEE Give them time. It'll get better. 
JACOB What if it doesn't? My dad hasn't gone back to work yet. What if he loses his job. We could lose our house. I could be homeless. 
MALEE Then you'll stay with me. 
LEONARD Or me. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
JACOB We're best friends.    We...

JOHN 
Rows right into it. His coracle pitches in the choppy surf. He scrambles onto the ship's cracked tile surface. Teeters -- balances -- moves to the unmistakeable HATCH. Looks around for a knob, a handle -- 
NEXT TO THE HATCH 
A small panel door whose black and yellow stripes denote urgency.  John hesitantly opens the door, revealing a shiny metal LEVER.  He stares at it...a beat. Then quickly pulls it down... WUORRRSH -! Hull door OPENS. 
The doorway is a black maw. John crosses himself. Begins to lower his foot into the hatch -- 
KYLE O/S Watch it! 
He almost falls backwards off the ship.  Looks back -- 
THE OTHER MONKS 
Are rapidly approaching. Kyle gestulates wildly -- 
KYLE John!  Wait -- !  Don't go in! 
John turns back to the open hatch. Machine recirculated air flows out. He feels it on the skin of his face.  Cool. Cool, and artificial.  It calls to him. He steps in.  Swallowed by the blackness -- 
WHOOSH-CLANG -! The door closes behind him. 
INT. SULACO ESCAPE POD #4 - DAY 
Dark.  Dim red lights.  John stands still as his eyes adjust to the darkness.  He sees: 
NEWT'S HYPER SLEEP TUBE 
A glass and metal COFFIN -- pneumatic piping twines around its base.  The glass lid is BROKEN.  A Small RED LIGHT pulses at the head of the tube -- a soft VOICE and TONE, like your seat belt warning -- is audible... 
COMPUTER VOICE (sotto) Seal broken...seal broken... 
John finds himself moving towards the tube... Looks through the broken lid: 
IN THE TUBE 
There is a splattered BLOOD STAIN on the sterile white interior.  OLD, turned rust-brown. Whatever happened here happened a while ago. Rust colored drips trail down to -- 
THE FLOOR 
Drag marks.  His eyes follow the stains to a pile of Bloody clothing against a control panel.  A jumpsuit.  Torn. Child size.  The head of child's DOLL, but no body to be found. 
JOHN 
Looks back towards the door. Part of him wants to get the hell out here -- but he fights back his fear.  He is a doctor - or trying to be - someone in here may need his help.  He presses forward -- Averts his gaze from the clothing, UP to the blinking and glowing instrument panels and their myraid -- 
LIGHTS 
Pressure lights.  Data lights.  Warning lights. Thousands of lights.  Like the stars in the sky. 
It's been decades since he's seen technology like this -- and never this close up.  He steps further into the ship, his fear now replaced by fascination, follows the lights.... 
ON A PALE GREEN SCREEN 
LED numbers race -- 7,291.01.05...06...07 A legand identifies "Elapsed since separation." He moves on... 
A VIDEO MONITOR 
Through scanning bars of snow, an image: A WOMAN with a YOUNG GIRL standing in front of her. The Woman's arms are wrapped around the girl. Protective. Maternal. 
The Woman speaks.  Her message repeats itself. A tape loop, although John has no idea what that is. 
WOMAN ...taking pod four.  The Crew of the SS Sulaco and all Marine commandoes are dead. Ship's sensors have interrupted the hyper sleep cycle.  An overlooked alien egg has hatched.  Bishop and Hicks have been killed. Xenomorphs have infested the cruiser.  Newt and I are taking pod four.  The Crew of... 
The WARNING TONE of the Woman's message rekindles John's fear. He moves more hesitantly around the periphery of the ship, following the trail of blinking instruments -- Drawn to touch a button.  Click... 
SOMETHING TENTACLE-LIKE DROPS DOWN ON HIS SHOULDER! Just an oxygen mask. 
John feels his rapidly BEATING heart as he pushes aside the plastic, dangling object and continues around the shuttle. His hand brushes over a SENSOR which responds by lighting and -- 
HSSSSSSSSS -! A BLAST of freon shoots out of an overhead pipe -- John SHOUTS and back up into -- 
ANOTHER HYPER SLEEP TUBE!!! 
Next to Newt's now empty tube. Humming gently.  Still operational. John approaches it cautiously. He can make out the occupant through the lid... 
A WOMAN

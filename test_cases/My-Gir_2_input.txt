VADA (in semi-deep fake voice) BINGO! 
BINGO ANNOUNCER We have a winner. Will the winner please raise their hand? 
CARL There was no bingo, it came from outside. 
VERNON How could someone outside get a bingo? 
CARL Someone outside didn't get a bingo, someone outside yelled bingo you moron! 
VERNON Who are you calling a mowon? (false teeth) 
VERNON'S WIFE Put a lid on it Vernon! 
CARL Put a lid on it?? If you weren't 200 years old, I'd kick your wrinkled ARSE!! 
The two old men then have a fight, Harry attempts to break it up 
HARRY Hey fellers fellers, it's just a bingo game. 
Meanwhile, Shelly has found it all rather amusing 
OUTSIDE 
VADA We can go now. 
Vada and Thomas J run off down the street 
VADA'S BEDROOM NIGHT, VADA IS LYING ON HER BED THINKING 
As she hears Harry's car approaching, she goes to her window and looks out it through the venetian blinds 
OUTSIDE STOPPED CAR 
Harry gets out of his side, comes round to the other side and then hesitates before deciding to follow his brothers advice and let Shelly get out herself, which she does, eventually 
SHELLY I had a good time tonight. 
HARRY I haven't had a bingo partner in ages. 
They walk up to Shelly's camper 
SHELLY Would you like to come in and see my house? Just for a minute. 
HARRY Okay, sure. 
They enter, Vada continues to watch them from her room 
INSIDE CAMPER, HARRY AND SHELLY ENTER 
SHELLY Home sweet home. 
HARRY It's nice. 
SHELLY I did it myself. I read a magazine article about how to maximize small spaces. 
HARRY Well it certainly looks bigger that it seems. 
SHELLY You can look in the bathroom if you want. People are always curious about that, like what happens when you flush. 
Harry moved toward the back of the camper and looks in the bathroom, and then flushes the toilet 
HARRY Yeah. 
SHELLY Are you mad at me?

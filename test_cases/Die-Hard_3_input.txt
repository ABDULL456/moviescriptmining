MCCLANE Two?  Are you sure? 
Before Powell can answer Robinson comes running up to him. 
ROBINSON Is that him? 
POWELL Yessir. 
ROBINSON (reaching for Powell's CB) Give me that. (angrily at McClane) Now, listen to me, mister, I don't know what you think you're doing, but demolishing a building doesn't fall under the definition of 'help'! There's hundreds of people out here and you covered half of them in pieces of glass -- 
MCCLANE Glass, my ass!  Who the fuck is this? 
ROBINSON This is Deputy Chief of Police Dwayne T. Robinson, and I'm in charge of this situation. 
McClane leans tiredly against the elevator door. 
MCCLANE Well, from up here, it looks like you're in charge of shit, Dwayne. I haven't seen such a fucked up operation since the Bride of Frankenstein.  Ask the guys in the armored car if they minded a little flying glass. 
ROBINSON Listen asshole -- ! 
MCCLANE (exploding) Asshole?  I'm not the one who just for butt fucked on national TV, Dwayne!  Now if you're not part of the solution, stop being part of the problem!  Get off the Goddamn radio and put Al back on! 
McClane is so furious, he's out of breath. 
226     INT. LIMO - ARGYLE - SAME                            226 
Argyle nods in agreement. 
ARGYLE Tell 'em, Mr. Mac!  Tell 'em! 
227     INT. 33RD FLOOR - ON MCCLANE                         227 
still seething.  There is a long pause on the CB, then: 
POWELL'S VOICE Hello, Roy.  How're you feeling? 
MCCLANE (pissed) Pretty fucking unappreciated. 
INTERCUT: 
228     ON POWELL                                            228 
Other officers, including Robinson, monitor the conversation. 
POWELL Hey, I love you. (looking around) So do a lot of the guys.  So hang in there, man.  Hang in there. 
MCCLANE (tired, touched) Thanks...partner. 
229     TV - CLOSE                                           229 
As it SNAPS ON.  We're in the studio set. 
GAIL (as the picture stabilizes) ...of the Nakatomi building, sources say that the terrorist leader 'Hans' may be this man, Hans Gruber. 
A SLIDE of Hans appears behind her.  At the same time, the CAMERA PULLS BACK.  We realize we're on THE HOSTAGE FLOOR, and Hans has just turned on the set out here for his "guests".  He smiles modestly as they "recognize" him from the on air shot, returns to the office. 
GAIL (on TV) A member of the radical West German Volksfrei movement. Strangely, the Volksfrei leadership issued a communique an hour ago stating that Gruber has been expelled from the organization and is operating on his own. 
HARVEY (on TV) Obviously, Gail whatever his affiliation, it's safe to say that Gruber's terrorist actions in Los Angeles tonight are well, terroristic... 
As the bullshit continues, Ellis suddenly STANDS, head towards the terrorist "office".  Immediately the chief guard here, Fritz, moves to intercept Ellis. 
HOLLY Where are you going? 
ELLIS I'm tired of sitting here waiting to see who gets us killed first... them...or your husband. (to the approaching Fritz) Hi there. 
HOLLY (worried) What are you going to do? 
ELLIS Hey, I negotiate million dollar deals for breakfast.  I can handle these clowns. (to Fritz) I want to talk to Hans.  Hans! Sprickenzie talk? 
He doesn't wait for an answer.  Fritz follows him.  Holly worries. 
230     THE OFFICE                                           230 
KARL (in mid-speech, angry) -- you wouldn't let me kill him when I had the chance -- 
HANS If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already! 
KARL I don't want neutral...I want dead -- 
ALL TURN at a rap on the door.  Ellis is there. 
ELLIS Hope I'm not interrupting...? 
HANS (to Fritz) What does he want? 
As Fritz shrugs: 
ELLIS It's not what I want, it's what I can give you.  Look, let's be straight, okay?  It's obvious you're not some dumb thug up here to snatch a few purses, am I right? 
Karl looks at Ellis and then at Hans, as if to say, let me plug this asshole right now.  But Hans is either amused of curious or bored enough to shake his head, turn back to Ellis. 
HANS (politely) You're very perceptive.

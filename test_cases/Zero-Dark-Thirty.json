{"train": "INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY CIA SECTION - STAIRCASE - ISLAMABAD \nDescending the lobby staircase with Daniel is JOSEPH BRADLEY, Chief of Station, Pakistan, a smooth, vain, sophisticated former case officer who hasn't quite buffed all the blood out of his fingernails. \nBRADLEY How did it go the other night? \nDANIEL It was good. The local cops need tactical help. But he's Tier fucking One, baby. There's your money maker. \nBRADLEY This is the guy that's KSM's nephew? What's his issue? \nDANIEL He's being a dick. \nBRADLEY If he's trying to outsmart you, tell him about your PhD. \nDANIEL I am going to have to turn up the heat. He needs to give us the Saudi group now. They reach the lobby, where they can see Maya sitting in the holding area. They walk towards her as Bradley considers what Daniel is asking for. \nINT. AMERICAN EMBASSY CIA SECTION - STAIRCASE/LOBBY \nBRADLEY He's gotta have that - given the family ties. Permission granted, Daniel reassures his boss. \nDANIEL Tight with his uncle, prints all over the 9/11 money. Daniel knocks on the glass for Maya to come in. \nDANIEL (CONT'D) (to Bradley, clocking her good looks) Was I lying or what? The guard opens the door and Maya comes through - not many females come through that door. \nDANIEL (CONT'D) \n(TO MAYA) Maya, this is Joseph Bradley, our illustrious station chief. (as they shake hands) Joe and I did Iraq together. \nBRADLEY And we continue our Christian mission here. Nice to meet you. \nMAYA You too, Sir. \nBRADLEY How was your flight? They walk down the lobby towards the Secure Wing. \nMAYA Fine. \nDANIEL She's been having a great time ever since she got in, isn't that right? \nBRADLEY How do you like Pakistan so far? \nMAYA It's kinda fucked up. \nBRADLEY You volunteered for this didn't you? \nMAYA No. Bradley smiles. He knew she didn't volunteer. They reach a secure area and Bradley checks Maya through an electronic door. \nBRADLEY \n(TO MAYA) Third floor, northeast corner. She goes through and Daniel and Bradley watch her walk away. \nDANIEL Don't you think she's a little young for the hard stuff? \nBRADLEY Washington says she's a killer. \nDANIEL The children's crusade. \nBRADLEY They want the next generation on the field. Listen, I have a meeting with ISI in twenty minutes. \nDANIEL They're slow rolling us in Lahore - you might want to bitch about that. \nBRADLEY Did you see the cable from London? \nDANIEL Dude, I've been in a dark room with another man for the last two days. \nCUT TO: \nINT. AMERICAN EMBASSY CIA SECTION - MAYA'S CUBICLE \nMaya finds her desk. It's covered with grime. She tries to clean it as best she can, then sits and looks at the blank log-in screen of her computer. \nINT. AMERICAN EMBASSY CIA SECTION - CONFERENCE ROOM \nA group of thirty-somethings filing in for a meeting, chatting, comradery, taking seats around a conference table. \nINT. MAYA'S APARTMENT - ISLAMABAD \nThe loud WAILING of the early morning call to prayer from the loudspeakers of a nearby mosque wakes Maya on the couch. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BLACK SITE - AFTERNOON \nDaniel and the guards enter Ammar's cell with Maya. Daniel switches on a floodlight, awakening Ammar. \nDANIEL Let's take it easy today, huh? Daniel hands Ammar a bottle of orange juice and a bag of falafel. \nDANIEL (CONT'D) Hungry? The food in here sucks so I got you some of this. Ammar grabs the lunch sack and scarfs down the falafels. \nDANIEL (CONT'D) Richard Reid, wow. I was thinking about him. The guy gets a bomb in his shoe on a plane. Unbelievable. You know him, don't you? Slowly, Ammar nods. \nAMMAR Yes. \nDANIEL I'm glad you said that. I have an email from you to him. I've had all your coms for years, bro. Who else is in your Saudi group? \nAMMAR I just handed out some cash for them. I didn't know who the guys were. \nDANIEL When you lie to me, I hurt you. \nAMMAR Please. \nDANIEL I believe you. I do, I believe you. Beat. \nDANIEL (CONT'D) Do you want the water again, or do you want something else? \nAMMAR Please. \nDANIEL Just give me a name. \nAMMAR \nI DON'T-- Daniel jumps up. \nAMMAR (CONT'D) I don't know. Daniel kicks out the chair from under Ammar. The masked guards walk to the rope pulleys. \nDANIEL You see how this works? You don't mind if my female colleague sees your junk, do you? Daniel pulls down Ammar's pants. Maya flinches at the bare nakedness. \nDANIEL (CONT'D) Dude, you shit your pants. \nDaniel turns to Maya - \nDANIEL (CONT'D) You stay here, I'll be back. Daniel goes out, leaving Maya standing alone in front of the naked, chained man. Ammar looks at her imploringly and she struggles to meet his eyes. \nAMMAR Your friend is an animal. Please, help me. Please. A long beat. \nMAYA You can help yourself by being truthful. The door handle turns. It occurs to Maya that perhaps Daniel was testing her resilience, too, as Daniel re-enters with a DOG COLLAR in his hand. \nDANIEL This is a dog collar. Daniel unhooks Ammar, snaps the collar and leash around his neck, as Ammar cries out against the humiliation. Maya flinches. Daniel is relentless: \nDANIEL (CONT'D) You determine how I treat you. Now Daniel drags Ammar on all fours, pulling him by the leash. \nDANIEL (CONT'D) I'm going to walk you. Maya watches in horror as Daniel walks Ammar to a far corner of the room, then leans down to address his victim: \nDANIEL (CONT'D) What the fuck do you think is going on, Ammar? Wahleed has already told me that you know. At last, Daniel reaches an area of the room where there is a large wooden box resting on a platform. \nDANIEL (CONT'D) This box sucks. I'm going to put you in it. Ammar tries to speak but can't get a word out. \nDANIEL (CONT'D) When is the attack? \nAMMAR \n(VERY SOFTLY) Sunday. \nDANIEL Sunday? Sunday where? This Sunday or next Sunday? Ammar mumbles, almost inaudibly. \nAMMAR Monday. \nDANIEL Is it Sunday or Monday? Ammar doesn't answer. The masked men approach. \nMAYA After we kept you awake for 96 hours, you gave us names of some of your brothers and saved the lives of a lot of innocent people. \nDANIEL Which is the smart thing to do, you're starting to think for yourself. Ammar is lost. But the food is tempting. \nDANIEL (CONT'D) Eat up! You earned it. Ammar eats. \nDANIEL (CONT'D) So you flew via Amman to Kabul to hang out with your uncle? Mukhtar. \nAMMAR How did you know that? \nDANIEL I told you man, I know you. Alright, you got me - flight manifests. It must've been pretty fucked up for you guys after 9/11. What did you do after the invasion and before you went back to Pesh? \nAMMAR After 9/11 I had to choose: fight, to protect our turf - or run. \nDANIEL \n(SYMPATHETIC) You chose to fight. Ammar looks Daniel right in the eyes. \nAMMAR I wanted to kill Americans. We tried to get into Tora Bora but the bombing was too high. We couldn't cross. \nMAYA Sorry, who is the \"we\" in that sentence? \nAMMAR Me and some guys who were hanging around at that time. \nDANIEL \n(CASUALLY) I can eat with some other dude and hook you back up to the ceiling? \nAMMAR Hamza Rabia, Khabab al-Masri, and Abu Ahmed. Maya makes notes on her pad. \nMAYA Who's Abu Ahmed? I've heard of the other guys. \nAMMAR He was a computer guy with us at the time. After Tora Bora, I went back to Pesh - as you know - and he went North, I think, to Kunar. \nMAYA What's his family name? \nAMMAR Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti. \nMAYA Abu Ahmed means \"father of Ahmed\", it's a kunya. \n(MORE) \nMAYA (CONT'D) Ammar, I know the difference between a war name and an Arabic name. \nDANIEL She got you there, dude. \nAMMAR I swear to you both: I don't know his family name. I would have never asked him something like that. It's not how my uncle worked. My uncle told me he worked for bin Laden. I did see him, once, about a year ago, in Karachi. He read us all a letter from the Sheikh. \nMAYA A letter? \nDANIEL What did it say? Daniel offers Ammar a smoke. \nDANIEL (CONT'D) Cigarette? Ammar accepts. Daniel's lights it. \nAMMAR It said \"Continue the jihad. The work will go on for a hundred years.\" \nCUT TO: \nINT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - RESEARCH ROOM \nWe fade into a dimly lit research room, where Maya is alone watching interrogation video recordings on an array of monitors. Some of the videos are rough; but most simply depict two people talking. The video she's watching now shows a hooded prisoner sitting in a filthy room, the walls smeared with red stains. \nCU SCREEN: \nSOLDIER INTERROGATOR You and I are gonna talk about some of the guys in the training camps, yeah? The prisoner sits in a chair. He's hooded, but relaxed. \nPRISONER Ok. \nSOLDIER INTERROGATOR Some of these brothers have done some bad things, and what I want to do is I want to separate them from the people like you. \nPRISONER Definitely, yeah. \nSOLDIER INTERROGATOR There was a guy called Abu Ahmed from Kuwait. \nINTERROGATOR How many other people? \nPRISONER \n(THINKING) Four or five. \nINTERROGATOR Let's talk about them-- The image freezes. Maya stares at the screen. \nINT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - KITCHEN \nMaya is in the kitchen grabbing something to eat. Jessica, the only other person working this late, walks in, pours herself some coffee. \nJESSICA How's the needle in the haystack? \nMAYA Fine. \nJESSICA Facilitators come and go, but one thing you can count on in life is that everyone wants money. The rivalry is in full bloom. Sometimes it's friendly. Sometimes it's not so friendly. \nMAYA \n(SMILING) You're assuming that Al Qaeda members are motivated by financial rewards. They're radicals. \nJESSICA \n(BIGGER SMILE) Correct. You're assuming that greed won't override ideology in some of the weaker members. \nMAYA Money for walk-ins worked great in the cold war, I'll give you that. \nJESSICA Thank you. \nMAYA Just not sure those tactics are applicable to the Middle East. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MAYA'S APARTMENT \nMaya hastily throws her clothes and a wig into a suitcase - the world's fastest packing job - \nCUT TO: \nEXT. WARSAW SHIPYARD - POLAND - DAY \nSUPERIMPOSE: CIA BLACK SITE - WARSAW, POLAND A sprawling shipyard in an industrial area. A large MILITARY FRIGATE sits in the harbor. A dark haired WOMAN and a MAN board the ship. \nCUT TO: \nINT. FRIGATE - BLACK SITE - POLAND - DAY \nAt first we don't recognize the woman with heavy makeup walking down the narrow corridor, and then we realize it's Maya in disguise. She enters a vast cavernous hold accompanied by a middle aged Afghan man, thick shouldered with years of hard experience in his kind, somewhat sad eyes. This fatherly man is HAKIM, a former political prisoner in Afghanistan and one of the CIA's most important assets. In the galley, a PRISONER is chained to a table. Hakim slides him The Photograph. The prisoner speaks in Arabic. \nHAKIM \n(TRANSLATING) He says he looks like Abu Ahmed. \nMAYA Who did he work for? Hakim translates. Then the prisoner speaks. \nHAKIM \n(TRANSLATING) It was mostly with Abu Faraj - they were always together. \nMAYA What did he do for Faraj? \nHAKIM \n(TRANSLATING) He carried messages from Faraj to bin Laden and from bin Laden back to Faraj. Maya leans into Hakim - \nMAYA We need to ask him something to see if he's telling the truth. We don't know if he really knew Faraj. Hakim speaks to the prisoner. \nHAKIM He just told me the names of all of Faraj's children. I think he's telling the truth. \nCUT TO: \nINT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - CIA SECTION \nEXT. ISLAMABAD TRAFFIC - YEARS LATER \nRain pelts the brown city, turning the gutter water black. \nMAYA (PRE-LAP) I want you to understand that I know you. I have been following you and studying you for a long time. I chased you in Lahore. We find Maya entering the gates of a Pakistani prison. The weather makes the place seem especially bleak. \nSUPERIMPOSE: MILITARY DETENTION CENTER - ISLAMABAD, PAKISTAN \nINT. PAKISTANI DETENTION AREA - CONTINUOUS \nHASSAN GHUL, Al Qaeda financier, sits manacled to a desk. \nMAYA I had you picked up instead of killing you because you're not a violent man and you don't deserve to die. \nGHUL Thank you. \nMAYA But you do have deep ties to Al Qaeda that I want to ask you about before you get sent to your next location, which might be Israel. Ghul looks ashen. \nMAYA (CONT'D) However, depending on how candid you are today, I may be able to keep you in Pakistan. \nGHUL What do you want to know? \nMAYA I'm going to ask you a series of questions based on your knowledge of Al Qaeda and your position as key financier for the organization. \nGHUL I have dealt with the mukhabarat, I have no wish to be tortured again. Ask me a question, I can answer it. \nMAYA What can you tell me about Atiyah Abd al-Rahman. \nGHUL He works for Zawahiri. He's in charge of military tactics. \nMAYA In what context have you ever heard the name Abu Ahmed? \nGHUL He works for Faraj and bin Laden. He is his most trusted courier. Maya works hard to hide how pleased she is to have this confirmation. She's not entirely successful. \nMAYA What makes you say that? \nGHUL He brought me many messages from the Sheikh. \nMAYA Where did you last see him, and where is he now? \nGHUL You will never find him. \nMAYA Why is that? \nGHUL Even I couldn't find him. He always contacted me out of the blue. He is one of the disappeared ones. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. GARDEN COMPLEX - PAKISTAN - DAY \nPakistani families enjoy a fine summer day. \nINT. GARDEN VILLA \nA BOMB is being strapped to a MAN'S leg by a PAKISTANI \nPOLICEMAN. \nPAKISTANI POLICEMAN \n(IN URDU) You know how this works? The man is terrified. \nPAKISTANI POLICEMAN (CONT'D) Just act naturally. The Policeman finishes securing the bomb, and sends the man out the door (who we will later deduce is Abu Faraj's courier). \nCUT TO: \nEXT. GARDEN COMPLEX - DAY \nFaraj's Courier walks past playing children... while from a nearby tower, Daniel observes. After a moment, ABU FARAJ, who we recognize from his photograph, appears at the south end of the park. Faraj walks in the direction of his courier, noting his \nSURROUNDINGS: CHILDREN playing. Several people in BLACK BURKHAS. \nBRIGHT SUN. At last Faraj reaches an open area where he can see his courier face to face. They exchange a nervous glance that conveys the danger: It's a trap. Faraj spins to flee, but it's too late. The black BURKHAS descend on him. It turns out they are heavily armed Pakistani agents. From on high, Daniel watches his captured prey. \nFARAJ A month ago, in Karachi, but I don't know where he is now. Sometimes I wouldn't even see him, he would just tell me where to leave the messages. \nMAYA I don't believe you. The GUARD in the room with them leans forward and SLAPS Faraj across the face. Faraj's expression doesn't change and Maya herself remains flat and steady, unmoved by the violence. She's not quite the same young lady she was a few years ago. \nMAYA (CONT'D) You're not being fulsome in your replies. \nFARAJ You can't force me to tell you something I don't know. \nMAYA You do realize this is not a normal prison. You determine how you are treated, and your life will be very uncomfortable until you give me information I need. The guard slaps Faraj again. Faraj is impassive. \nCUT TO: \nINT. INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER \nMaya looks on impassively as Faraj is subjected to harsh treatment. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BLACK SITE - BATHROOM \nMaya is retching in the stall. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BLACK SITE - PRE-DAWN \nMaya walks around the facility, quiet at this hour, and finds another insomniac, Daniel, by the monkey cage. The cage is empty. \nMAYA Faraj is completely denying knowing Abu Ahmed, and that's using every measure we have. \nDANIEL He's either going to withhold or die from the pressure you're putting on him. \nMAYA Do you want to take a run at him? \nDANIEL No. \nMAYA No? Since when? \nDANIEL You know, I've been meaning to tell you: I'm getting outta here. \nMAYA What? You okay? \nDANIEL I'm fine. I've just seen too many guys naked. It's gotta be over a hundred at this point. I need to go do something normal for awhile. \nMAYA Like what? \nDANIEL Go to Washington, do the dance, see how that environment works. \n(BEAT) You should come with me. Be my number two. You're looking a little strung out yourself. Maya looks at Dan. No longer the man he once was. She doesn't hide her disappointment. \nMAYA I'm not going to find Abu Ahmed from \nD.C. They both look at the empty cage, clocking the irony. \nDANIEL They killed my monkeys. Something about an escape. Can you fucking believe that? \nMAYA Sorry, Dan. \nDANIEL Look, Maya, you gotta be really careful with detainees now. The politics are changing and you don't want to be the last one holding a dog collar when the oversight committee comes. \nMAYA I know. \nDANIEL And watch your back when you get back to Pakistan. Everyone knows you there now. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ISLAMABAD - NIGHT \nBack in Pakistan, the country has indeed changed to a more militarized police state, and as we establish the new environment, we find Maya's grey sedan... \nEXT. ISLAMABAD - NEAR THE MARRIOTT HOTEL - NIGHT \nThe car pulls up to a checkpoint manned by PAKISTANI POLICE. The Policeman look at the car - look at the plate - the plate is diplomatic - they walk around the car and stop at the window - shine their bright light right into Maya's eyes. A POLICEMAN motions for her to roll down her window. \nFATALLY. \n--SMOKE FILLS THE ROOM As alarms wail, Maya struggles to her feet, grabs Jessica by the arm, and they stumble to safety. \nINT.

TRIBAL VILLAGE HUT \nNow we are inside a hut and we've shifted to the perspective of a hand held camera, as if someone inside this stone age interior is filming on our behalf, and we see a hard floor, thin gaps in the walls, and FIVE TRIBAL ELDERS talking casually, eating and drinking tea. \nWe pan across the weathered faces, long beards, and see a video recorder resting on a ledge. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

AMERICAN EMBASSY CIA SECTION - MAYA'S CUBICLE - DAY \nJessica beaming as she approaches Maya. \nJESSICA The Jords have a mole! \nMAYA What? Jessica pops a CD into Maya's computer, loads a file that plays the same video clip we have just seen. \nJESSICA He made this video to prove his bona fides. \nMAYA Shut the fuck up! The camera stops on one man, BALAWI. \nJESSICA \n(POINTING) Humam Khalil al-Balawi, he's a Jordanian doctor. He's really motivated. Maya practically bolts out of her chair. Together, they start walking towards Bradley's office - \nMAYA This could be it! \nJESSICA This is it. \nINT. AMERICAN EMBASSY CIA SECTION - STATION CHIEF'S OFFICE - \nCONTINUOUS Bradley has just finished watching the video. Maya and Jessica are in his office waiting for his verdict. \nJESSICA He's right there in the inner circle. \nBRADLEY I don't buy it. Didn't you tell me yourself nobody turns on Al Qaeda? \nJESSICA The Jords worked him for a year. Dinners, money. They've convinced him that it's his patriotic duty to turn on Al Qaeda and get rich doing it. \nBRADLEY Yeah, so the Jords say. \nMAYA \n(TO BRADLEY) You're right. We can't rely on the Jords. We have to evaluate him face to face. \nINT. DINING AREA \nJessica pours two glasses of wine and raises a toast to her colleague, JOHN. \nJESSICA Not to get technical, but this guy is actually the first big break we've had since 9/11. To big breaks and the little people that make them happen. Clink. \nJESSICA (CONT'D) So far, everything he's said we've cross checked and it's proved legit... and I think the money is persuasive. 25 million dollars?! That buys a new life. \nJOHN Do you think he might be exaggerating his access? \nJESSICA Possibly. But Al Qaeda needs doctors and they are short staffed and that could explain his rise. In six months to a year, if he doesn't fuck up, he could be called in to treat bin Laden. And at that moment, with 25 mil on the table, I think he gives up the Big Man. And if he doesn't, we kill him. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CAMP CHAPMAN CIA COMPOUND - AFTERNOON \nThe same gathering as the day before, waiting under the merciless sun. \nSUPERIMPOSE: DECEMBER 30, 2009 Jessica turns to her crew, which includes LAUREN, a young operative, ZIED, a Jordanian intelligence agent, and the base's CIA SECURITY GUARD, among others. They rehearse the impending meeting. \nJESSICA So John? (John turns to her) When he arrives, I'll set the tone, and then I'll flip it to you - and you'll talk about asset protection. \nJOHN Roger that. \nJESSICA Then Lauren, I know you want to get some questions in there - but give Balawi time after John speaks. We'll cover the basics and have his birthday cake, then we'll get to the nitty gritty. \nJessica turns to Zied. \nJESSICA (CONT'D) Is that order okay, or do you want to introduce everyone? \nZIED I'll introduce you, and you introduce your team. He knows this is a high level meeting. \nSECURTY GUARD Quick question: all is taking place inside our main building? \nJESSICA Right. And Lauren? Washington will want real time updates so please stay on top of that. Be concise. The Director is in the loop. And I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't update the President. \nLAUREN Yeah, I'm on it. They take in the possibilities. \nJESSICA Now, I just need to get Balawi's ass down here. \nLATER - Waiting and waiting. No cars approach. The sun beats down. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

You might have spooked him already! \nSECURTY GUARD Procedures only work if we follow them every time. \nJESSICA This time is different - I'm sorry I can't explain, but it's for a good cause. \nSECURTY GUARD Look, I'm responsible for everyone's safety, okay? It's not just about you. \nJESSICA I just need them to go away for a minute. You can search him as soon as he gets here.

GEORGE WRIGHT, Chief of the Afghanistan Pakistan Department, has just flown in from D.C. A big man, striding quickly into the room with the street roll of the Bronx projects he grew up in, George looks ready for a brawl. \nGEORGE I want to make something absolutely clear. \n(MORE) \nGEORGE (CONT'D) If you thought there was some secret cell somewhere working Al Qaeda, I want you to know that you're wrong. This is it. There's no working group coming to the rescue. He stares at his staff. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) There's nobody else, hidden away on some other floor. There is just us. And we are failing. We're spending billions of dollars. People are dying. We're still no closer to defeating our enemy. \nPACING NOW: \nGEORGE (CONT'D) They attacked us on land in 98, by sea in 2000, and from the air in 2001. They murdered three thousand of our citizens in cold blood, and they've slaughtered our forward deployed.

Sitting alone at her desk we find Maya just as she's finishing a report. She gets up, crosses the room and goes to the desk of a young woman who reminds us in her idealistic enthusiasm of the way Maya was six years ago. This is DEBBIE. \nDEBBIE Hi. I painstakingly combed through everything in the system and found this. \nShe hands Maya a file. \nDEBBIE (CONT'D) It's him. He was one of ten names on a watch list sent to us by the Moroccans after 9/11: Ibrahim Sayeed. They told us to watch out for him, apparently they think his whole family and extended family is bad and has ties to KSM. \n(BEAT) He was picked up for fake papers and a doctored exit visa leaving Afghanistan, traveling through Morocco en route to Kuwait. Abu Ahmed al- Kuwaiti. This must be Abu Ahmed. \nMAYA Doesn't matter, but I wish I had that five years ago. How come I never saw it before? \nDEBBIE Nobody saw it, most likely. There was a lot of white noise after 9/11, countries wanting to help out, we got millions of tips and... \n(SHRUGS) Things got lost in the shuffle. Human error. Maya turns her attention back to the WHITE BOARD and as Debbie keeps talking we follow Maya's gaze across the row of MUG SHOTS of Al Qaeda personnel. While a few of the men are African or are distinctive looking for other reasons, most of them look fairly similar in that they're all wearing the same type of clothes and have the same trademark long gnarly beards. \nDEBBIE (CONT'D) \n(PRESSING ON) Anyway I thought you should know about it. \n(PLUS) I just want to say I've heard a lot about you. You inspired me to come to Pakistan. Maya's eyes narrow. She keeps looking at the WHITE BOARD \nDEBBIE (CONT'D) Maybe you'll let me buy you a kabob sometime? \nMAYA \n(DISTRACTEDLY) Don't eat out. It's too dangerous. Maya stares at the Al Quaeda mugshots - a thought crosses her mind. \nCUT TO: \nINT. AMERICAN EMBASSY CIA SECTION - BRIEFING ROOM - NIGHT \nMaya on the speaker phone to Daniel.

What are you thinking? \nKUWAITI BUSINESSMAN I think I'll choose this one. The salesman retreats to a back office. \nDANIEL That's a nice choice, my friend.

AMERICAN EMBASSY CIA SECTION - SECURITY BAY - DAY \nThe station's surveillance team leader, LARRY, unstraps his flack vest. He looks like the kind of guy you don't mess with....so of course Maya barges into his space like a locomotive. \nMAYA How come you haven't deployed a team to stay in Rawalpindi? \nLARRY For one thing, it's dangerous. For another, the area is too congested for us to be effective without some predictive intelligence. \nMAYA That's why you should forward deploy - so you can shorten your response time. \nLARRY Still, it wouldn't work. \nMAYA Why? \nLARRY The guy never stays on the phone long enough. \nMAYA You haven't tried. \nLARRY Look, I don't have the personnel. \nMAYA That's bullshit. \nLARRY As it is, my guys don't get any sleep tracking the threats within Pakistan. Larry pushes past her to leave, and she follows him. \nMAYA Right, I understand. But I don't really care if your guys get sleep or not. Maya looks at Larry's team sleeping on the couch. \nINT. AMERICAN EMBASSY AMERICAN BAR - LATER \nCUT TO: \nINT. AMERICAN EMBASSY AMERICAN BAR - NIGHT \nMaya, despondent, sits at the bar, drinking a beer. \nJack approaches. \nJACK Fuck the mom, we got the man himself. Jack puts a cell phone down on the counter. \nJACK (CONT'D) Yesterday your caller bought himself a cell phone. And every time his phone rings - (he taps the cell \nPHONE) - This phone will ring. Did I hook you up? Maya throws her arms around him. \nMAYA I love you! \nCUT TO: \nEXT. RAWALPINDI - ROAD - DAY \nLarry drives his team around the narrow streets of Rawalpindi. In the backseat, the COMPUTER TECH studies his laptop-like tracking device. \nMAYA O.S. My guess is that he lives close to where he's making the calls, and it makes sense he'd be living in Rawalpindi because there's an Al Jezerra office there. \nINT. AMERICAN EMBASSY CIA SECTION - BRIEFING ROOM \nWe focus on a MAP of Pakistan on the wall. Maya is indicating neighborhoods in Rawalpindi. She's briefing Bradley, Hakim, Larry and a few other people. \nMAYA It would be convenient for him to drop tapes off if he's sending either from bin Laden or from an intermediary. When he wants to make a call, he leaves the house, walks a few blocks, then switches on the phone. We need to keep canvassing the neighborhood until we find him. \nEXT. STREETS OF RAWALPINDI / MINIVAN - CONTINUOUS \nLarry is at the wheel, moving slowly through a dangerous part of town. The streets narrow. Two motorcycles suddenly pull around in front of Larry's van and stop. The riders pull out guns. \nINT. MINIVAN - CONTINUOUS \nLARRY We got a shooter! Larry tries reversing but a compact car wheels in right behind them, and Larry slams on the brakes. The TECH raises an M4. \nTECH We're blocked. \nHAKIM Let me talk to them. \nEXT. STREETS OF RAWALPINDI \nHakim gets out of the car and walks toward the men. We can't hear what they're saying. At last, Hakim comes back to the car. \nINT. MINIVAN \nHAKIM They said white faces don't belong here. If they don't move, shoot them. A tense beat while the men stare, then finally leave. \nINT.

The Geo Locator starts to BEEP - a blinking red light. \nCOMPUTER TECH He's east of us. Try the market. \nEXT./INT. MINIVAN \nThe congestion thickens. They slow to a crawl. The SUV, stuck in traffic. Can't move. Larry leaps out of the car and heads into an open air market - \nEXT. OPEN AIR MARKET - PESHAWAR - CONTINUOUS \nGEORGE If there are three females, there ought to be three males. Observant Muslim women either live with parents or with their husbands. We think there's a third family living in the house. \nSUPERIMPOSE: SITUATION ROOM - THE WHITE HOUSE \nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR So this third male that you've identified as possibly being bin Laden, do I just give up all hope of ever seeing a photograph of him? \nGEORGE Hope? Hope is not a targeting layer. You give up your hope right now. We scanned for heat signatures, but we can't validate if it's a man or a woman up there. We found a safe house, but we can't get a vantage point to fire a telescope over the balcony wall. \nEXT. COMPOUND - ABBOTTABAD - MORNING \nA DOCTOR comes to the compound offering immunizations. One of the women let's him in, and he offers polio vaccines to the children. \nGEORGE We talked about burrowing a pin hole camera but there's a high risk of discovery. \n(MORE) \nGEORGE (CONT'D) We have explored the possibility of digging tunnels, of sending hot air balloons, of re-routing supply C- 130's to take a peek, but that might be too alerting. We've looked for ways of collecting available DNA from his trash - you know, looking for his toothbrush, but they burn the trash. We started a vaccination program, we sent a doctor to the house, to see if he could pull blood. A lady in a black burkha rushes out and angrily shoos the doctor away. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) That didn't work out. We thought about sending a guy with a bucket to pull a sample from the sewer to analyze his fecal matter. \nSPECIAL ASSISTANT TO THE ADVISOR What was wrong with that, exactly? He looks up. \nGEORGE What was wrong with that? The sample would be too diluted. \nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR And it's asking too much to get a voice confirmation with him on the phone? \nGEORGE They don't make telephone calls from the compound. We pulled the cell tower nearby. \nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR And I'm also going to give up hope that he might ever get in that white SUV and drive around a bit and we could see him? Don't they get groceries. \nGEORGE The unidentified third male does not get groceries. He does not leave the compound. He does not present himself for photographs. \n(MORE) \nGEORGE (CONT'D) When he needs fresh air, he paces around beneath a grape arbor, but the leaves are so thick they obscure our satellite views. This is a professional attempt to avoid detection - real tradecraft. The only people we've seen behave this way are other top level Al Qaeda operatives. The National Security Advisor nods to his Special Assistant who slides a big folder across his desk to George. \nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR We did a Red Team on your analysis. According to them, this behavior could belong to someone other than Al Qaeda. \nDEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR They did give a forty percent chance that the unidentified third man is a senior Al Qaeda operative. But they also said there's a thirty-five percent chance he's a Saudi drug \nDEALER (reading from the \nBINDER) A fifteen percent chance that he's a Kuwaiti arms smuggler, a ten percent chance that he's one of the relatives of the brothers. \nSPECIAL ASSISTANT TO THE ADVISOR Basically, we agree with you, the house screams security, it screams someone who wants privacy, it even screams 'bad guy', but it does not scream bin Laden. \nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR You get the point. \n(BEAT) If you can't prove it's bin Laden, at least prove it's not somebody else, like a drug dealer. Beat. The meeting is adjourned. As they walk out -- \nGEORGE You know we lost our ability to prove that when we lost the detainee program. \n(BEAT) Who the hell am I supposed to ask? Some guy in Gitmo who is all lawyered up? He'll just tell his lawyer to warn bin Laden. \nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR You'll think of something. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - AF/PAK DIVISION - DAY \nMaya is back at George's office, keeping track of time for us by writing each passing day on the window of George's office. We watch as she erases the numbers in red and writes new ones. 78. Time passes. \n100 days. She underscores the numerals in thick magic marker. \nCUT TO: \nINT. WHITE HOUSE - NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL S.C.I.F. - DAY \nThe same group around the same conference table. \nGEORGE He'd be the first successful drug dealer never to have dealt drugs. He has no internet access to the house. He makes no phone calls either in or out. Who's he selling to, who's he buying from, how's he making his money? And if you're going to say he's retired, I'd say where's his swimming pool, where's the gold cage with the falcons? And why does he send his courier to the two cities in Pakistan we most associate with Al Qaeda, that have nothing particularly to do with heroin production? The National Security Advisor taps his pencil impatiently. \nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR The President is a thoughtful, analytical guy. He needs proof. \nINT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - CAFETERIA - DAY \nGeorge is pulling his tray away from the food service court when Maya ambushes him. \nMAYA We've spun up the SEALs - we've done everything humanly possible to collect on the compound, and the collection is not going to get any better. \nGEORGE We have to keep working it. \nMAYA You're going to come into work one day, and there's going to be a black moving van and a 'for sale' sign in front of that compound. George drops his tray down. \nGEORGE Maya, you didn't prove it. \nINT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - 7TH FLOOR - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nSitting around the table are the CIA Director, JEREMY, Wolf, the DEPUTY DIRECTOR, George, Daniel, Steve and a few other people we don't know. At the far end of the table are back benchers, including Maya. \nCIA DIRECTOR I'm about to go look the President in the eye and what I'd like to know, no fucking bullshit, is where everyone stands on this thing. Now, very simply. Is he there or is he not fucking there? He looks to the Deputy Director. \nDEPUTY DIRECTOR We all come at this through the filter of our own past experiences. I remember Iraq WMD very clearly, I fronted that and I can tell you the case for that was much stronger than this case. \nCIA DIRECTOR Yes or no. \nDEPUTY DIRECTOR We don't deal in certainty, we deal in probability. I'd say there's a sixty percent probability he's there. The CIA Director points to Wolf. \nWOLF I concur. Sixty percent. \nGEORGE I'm at eighty percent. Their OPSEC is what convinces me. \nCIA DIRECTOR You guys ever agree on anything? \nDANIEL Well, I agree with sixty, we're basing this mostly on detainee reporting and I spent a bunch of time in those rooms - who knows? Maya shoots Daniel a look. What a traitor. \nDANIEL (CONT'D) I'd say it's a soft sixty, sir. I'm virtually certain there's some high value target there, I'm just not sure it's bin Laden. The CIA Director leans back in his chair. \nCIA DIRECTOR This is a cluster-fuck, isn't it? \nJEREMY I'd like to know what Maya thinks. \nDEPUTY DIRECTOR We're all incorporating her assessment into ours. Maya can't take it anymore: \nMAYA One hundred percent, he's there - okay, fine, ninety-five percent because I know certainty freaks you guys out - but it's a hundred! \nINT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - 7TH FLOOR - HALLWAY \nThe CIA Director walks with Jeremy towards the elevator. \nCIA DIRECTOR They're all cowed. What do you think of the girl? \nJEREMY I think she's fucking smart. As the door closes. \nCIA DIRECTOR We're all smart, Jeremy. \nINT. LANGELY CAFETERIA \nMaya is eating lunch by herself when she's startled to see the CIA Director standing by her table. \nCIA DIRECTOR May I join you? She nods, gulps. \nCIA DIRECTOR (CONT'D) \n(SITTING) How long have you worked for the \nCIA? \nMAYA Twelve years. I was recruited out of high school. \nCIA DIRECTOR Do you know why we did that? \nMAYA I don't think I can answer that question, sir. I don't think I'm allowed to answer. \nCIA DIRECTOR What else have you done for us besides bin Laden? \nMAYA Nothing. I've done nothing else. He evaluates her... weighing her certainty against his decades of Washington experience. \nINT.

COMPOUND - FIRST GATE \nPatrick, Justin and SIX other SEALs cluster near the First Gate in the animal pen. One of the SEALs places a charge on the gate, while others check the Prayer Room. Boom! The charge partially blows open the metal swing doors of the gate, leaving a very narrow gap. Not ideal. The SEALs muscle and squeeze their way through the narrow opening in the jagged metal as the SNIPER climbs up on the roof of the prayer room. \nEXT. GUEST HOUSE - NIGHT \nPatrick and Jared arrive at the guest house but can't see inside - the windows and doors are covered with sheets. Patrick kneels down to place a charge at the front door handle when the door erupts with gunfire - Bullets fly out of the wooden door. One skims Patrick's shoulder as he kneels lower. Patrick fires back at the house, putting a dozen rounds inside. A moment passes. They wait for a response. The door handle unlocks. ABU AHMED'S WIFE appears at the doorway and walks out. \nJARED Ir-fah ee-dek! \nABU AHMED'S WIFE \n(IN ENGLISH) You killed him. \nINT.

MAIN HOUSE FIRST FLOOR - CONTINUOUS \nPiercing the first floor darkness with their infra red lights, the SEALs advance slowly into the first floor hallway. Piles of household clutter, stacked high in bizarre shapes, greet them like the innards of a haunted house. One of the SEAL's catches movement: A figure with an AK-47 scrambling through clutter, then disappearing around a corner. \nJUSTIN Abrar!

A few feet away from him in the dimly lit hall is a loaded AK-47. He goes to the gun and picks it up. He hears his name again, \"Khaled!\" And the voice sounds friendly, urgent. Perhaps thinking that he can surrender peacefully, Khaled puts the gun down, resting it against a wall, and turns and heads back to the sound of his name. Saber sees Khaled poke his head around the corner of the stairway and fires - killing him instantly. Saber pushes past the body, Patrick following, and they climb the staircase leading to the third floor. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

He looks like a paramilitary hipster, a punk rocker with a Glock. \nDANIEL (CONT'D) (explaining the rules) If you don't look at me when I talk to you, I hurt you. If you step off this mat, I hurt you. If you lie to me, I'm gonna hurt you. Now, Look at me. His prisoner, AMMAR, stands on a decaying gym mat, surrounded by four GUARDS whose faces are covered in ski masks. Ammar looks down. Instantly: the guards rush Ammar, punching and kicking. \nDANIEL (CONT'D) Look at me, Ammar. Notably, one of the GUARDS wearing a ski mask does not take part in the beating. \nEXT. BLACK SITE - LATER \nDaniel and the masked figures emerge from the interrogation room into the light of day. They remove their masks and we see that one is a beautiful young woman in her mid-twenties. She has a pale, milky innocence and bright blue eyes, thin and somewhat frail looking, yet possessing a steely core that we will come to realize is off-the-charts. This is MAYA, a CIA targeter and subject-matter expert on her first overseas assignment. \nDANIEL (to the guard) Are we gonna board up these windows or what? \n(TO MAYA) Just off the plane from Washington, you're rocking your best suit for your first interrogation, and then you get this guy. It's not always this intense. \nMAYA I'm fine. She's not. \nDANIEL Just so you know, it's going to take awhile. He has to learn how helpless he is. Let's get a coffee. \nMAYA No, we should go back in. Something about the strange intensity of her expression makes Daniel reconsider and he turns back to the interrogation room. \nDANIEL You know, there's no shame if you wanna watch from the monitor. She shakes her head. \nDANIEL (CONT'D) Alright. At the door, Daniel hands the ski mask back to Maya. \nDANIEL (CONT'D) You might want to put this on. \nMAYA You're not wearing one.

Maya stands a few feet behind Daniel, attentive, wary of what is to come. This is her first interrogation and she is on the verge of vomiting from the stench in the room. She looks around at the sound-proofed walls, the puddles of water on the floor. \nDANIEL Right now, this is about you coming to terms with your situation. It's you and me, bro. I want you to understand that I know you, that I've been studying you for a very long time. I could have had you killed Karachi. But I let you live so you and I could talk. \nAMMAR \n(RESISTANT) You beat me when my hands are tied. I won't talk to you. \nDANIEL Life isn't always fair, my friend. Did you really think that when we got you, I'd be a nice fucking guy? \nAMMAR You're a mid-level guy. You're a garbage man in a corporation. Why should I respect you? \nDANIEL And you're a money man. A paperboy! Daniel paces around Ammar, anger rising. \nDANIEL (CONT'D) A disgrace to humanity! \n(MORE) \nDANIEL (CONT'D) You and your uncle murdered three thousand innocent people. I have your name on a five-thousand dollar transfer via Western Union to a 9/11 hijacker. He leans into Ammar's ear.

And I know this dude is up to some serious shit, and what I want from you is his Saudi email. \n(PAUSE) Feel free to jump in. \n(PAUSE) Ammar, bro, I know that you know this dude, just give me his email...and I will give you a blanket. I will give you a blanket and some solid food. No response from Ammar.

It all happens in a flash: in one swift motion, Daniel pushes Ammar to the floor, the guards pin his limbs, and Daniel smothers Ammar's face with a towel. Ammar thrashes. Daniel considers his next move. \nDANIEL (CONT'D) \n(TO MAYA) Grab the bucket. Maya follows Daniel's gesture to the corner of the room, where there's an ICE CHEST filled with WATER and a PLASTIC \nPITCHER. \nDANIEL (CONT'D) Put some water in it. She dips the pitcher in the water, hands shaking. \nDANIEL (CONT'D) C'mon, let's go. The stress and strain on her face is enormous as she brings the bucket back to Daniel. Daniel starts pouring the water on Ammar's face, which is now covered by a towel. Ammar thrashes with rising panic. \nDANIEL (CONT'D) Hazem was a friend of Ramzi Yousef, you guys met in Tunisia back in the 70s. \nAMMAR (gasping for breath) I don't know, you asshole. Maya shakes her head \"no.\" \nMAYA That's not credible. \nAMMAR \n(SCREAMING) Why are you doing this to me? \nDANIEL You're a terrorist, that's why I'm doing it to you. \nAMMAR Fuck you. Daniel pours water over the towel so it hits Ammar's nose. \nDANIEL I want emails of the rest of the Saudi group. Give me emails of the rest of the Saudi group! Give me one email, and I will stop this! Ammar doesn't speak. He can't. \nDANIEL (CONT'D) Who's in the Saudi group, and what's the target? Where was the last time you saw bin Laden? WHERE WAS THE \nLAST TIME YOU SAW BIN LADEN? Daniel throws the pitcher, rips the rag off Ammar's mouth: and water spurts out - Ammar nearly drowned. He gasps for air. \nDANIEL (CONT'D) This is what defeat looks like, bro. Your jihad is over. Daniel stands. \nDANIEL (CONT'D) Get him up. The guards bring Ammar to his feet. Daniel, shifting his persona yet again, touches Ammar's face and speaks to him with the comforting tenor of a therapist. \nDANIEL (CONT'D) Try to understand the concept here. I have time, you don't. I have other things to do, you don't. \n(BEAT) It's cool that you're strong. I respect it, I do. But in the end, everybody breaks, bro. It's biology. Dan and Maya exit. They've learned nothing. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ISLAMABAD, PAKISTAN - MORNING \nSUPERIMPOSE: ISLAMABAD, PAKISTAN \nA colorful, dusty city. Busy markets. Poor children. Dense traffic. Meanwhile, across town: \nEXT. DIPLOMATIC QUARTER - ISLAMABAD - DAY \nNational flags. Imposing buildings. Armed guards. The outpost of a superpower.

Beat. \nTECH Twenty. Thirty. Forty! Fifty - we're within ten meters of him. Larry scans the street - sees a half dozen guys on cell phones. \nTECH (CONT'D) He's really close. \nLARRY Look at the cars. He's in a vehicle. Larry spots something: \nLARRY (CONT'D) The guy with the phone in the white \nSUV. They snap a photograph of a WHITE POTAHAR SUV. \nLARRY (CONT'D) Is that him? \nTECH Could be. \nLARRY You got him? \nTECH I got him. \nLARRY I'm breaking off - The grey minivan pulls away. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

(looks at his watch, \nINTO PHONE) When can we grab lunch? He sees that Maya, who hovers annoyingly over his desk, isn't gonna wait. \nMAYA I need a picket line along the GT highway and men spaced at intervals along the road and at every exit. \nALEXANDER Maya, I know - \nMAYA So you agree with me now. This is important? \nALEXANDER No, I've just learned from my predecessor that life is better when I don't disagree with you. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. GRAND TRUNK ROAD - PAKISTAN - DAY \nA two lane highway. Tucked on the side of the road is an OLD MAN with a cart of mangoes. \nMAYA (V.O.) Our current hypothesis is that he lives somewhere along the highway, in one of the towns, or a medium sized city called Abbottabod, or up near Kashmir. ECU: mango cart. Nestled among the fruit is a BLACK RADIO. \n", "test2_true": "Squatting in the dirt near a bus stop is another OLD MAN, watching passengers disembark from a bus. \nMAYA (V.O.) Kashmir is interesting because it's a way station for the Tribals. We stay with the old man for a while. At last, the white POTAHAR SUV drives past. He makes a note in his pad. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HIGHWAY - MAJOR EXIT - DAY \nA nut seller, another CIA look out, scoops a handful of nuts into a bag for a CUSTOMER as he keeps an eye on CARS exiting the highway. He takes note as the white POTAHAR passes him. \nMAYA (V.O.) Abbottabod is interesting because we know from detainee reporting that Faraj stayed there, briefly in 2003. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. PAKISTANI STREET - DAY \nThe street is filled with compact cars. \nMAYA (V.O.) The good news is he's driving a white SUV. SUV's are actually pretty rare in Pakistan.

CIA HEADQUARTERS PREDATOR BAY - LANGLEY - EVENING \nThe Langley Predator Bay is an impressive sight, a command center bristling with high-tech equipment. The room is filled with TECHNICIANS. George is in the center, where he belongs, directing traffic. People come up and give him new pieces of information. The big screen displays a single image: The overhead satellite image of the compound in Abbottabod. \nSUPERIMPOSE: PREDATOR BAY - CIA HEADQUARTERS From the back of the room, Maya enters, and watches the activity unfold without her... without her input. George notices her, gives a thumbs up and then turns back to his troops. STEVE, early 40s, a senior manager and one of George's top deputies, joins Maya. \nSTEVE Basically we had a guy who rolled with Al Qaeda and did services for them. We lost him for seven years and now we found him again -- and boy does he have a really nice house. Is that it? \nMAYA Pretty much. \nSTEVE Okay, let's go talk to the boss. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LANGLEY BRIEFING ROOM \nMaya and Steve are the first to arrive in the wood panelled conference room. A detailed TABLE TOP MODEL of the compound sits in the center of the conference table, right next to a poster-sized satellite image of the compound. She starts to sit in one of the chairs. \nSTEVE \n(GENTLE) You should sit back there...sorry. Steve points her to the back of the room. \nSTEVE (CONT'D) They're gonna ask: if bin Laden is at the end of this rainbow - is the Pak military with him? \nMAYA The question isn't are the Paks protecting bin Laden?' \n(MORE) \nMAYA (CONT'D) The question is, 'would he allow himself to be protected by the Paks?' I mean, why would he trust them? He tried to kill Musharaf. Steve considers a reply, but the meeting principals are filing in, including Daniel, and when Steve sees the CIA DIRECTOR enter the room, he clears the head of the table. \nCIA DIRECTOR Go ahead. \nSTEVE If you take a right out of Islamabad and drive about forty-five minutes North, you'll find yourself here in Abbottabad. A middle class community - some ex-military - not particularly interesting to us. Except we did find this compound, which is unique. We got a sixteen foot wall around the entire perimeter, the windows are blacked out. It's a fortress. \nCIA DIRECTOR Can't you put a camera somewhere - in the trees - to get a look into the main house? \nGEORGE It will probably be discovered. \nCIA DIRECTOR We have to get a look into the house. The Director moves to the satellite image. \nCIA DIRECTOR (CONT'D) Alright, what's this? This cluster of buildings down here. \nGEORGE The PMA - The Pakistan Military Academy. It's their West Point. \nCIA DIRECTOR And how close is that to the house? \nGEORGE About a mile. A WOMAN'S voice from the back of the room. \nMAYA O.S. 4,221 feet. It's closer to eight- tenths of a mile. \nCIA DIRECTOR Who are you? \nMAYA I'm the motherfucker that found this place, Sir. The boss studies her for a moment then turns back to the model. \nCIA DIRECTOR I want to know more about who's inside this house by the end of the week. The brass files out, leaving Steve and Maya. \nSTEVE \"Motherfucker?\" Really? \nCUT TO: \nINT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - AF/PAK DIVISION - DAY \nMaya sits at her desk, frustrated, then walks down the aisle of cubicles to the glass wall of George's office. She grabs a red marker. \nMAYA (through the glass) Morning, George. In red magic marker, Maya writes the number 21 on the glass. Then circles it. George looks up. \nMAYA (CONT'D) Twenty-one days. It's been twenty- one days since we found the house and nothing's happened! \nINT.

CIA HEADQUARTERS MAYA'S DESK - LATER \nMaya sits at her desk. Her phone rings. \nMAYA \n(INTO PHONE) Yeah? \nINT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - PREDATOR BAY \nSTEVE stares at drone image of the COMPOUND, which is under the joystick control of an IMAGERY TECHNICIAN. \nSTEVE Swing by, I want to show you something. \nINT. CIA HEADQUARTERS MAYA'S DESK \nMaya jumps up from her desk. \nINT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - PREDATOR BAY - MOMENTS LATER \nMaya walks in. Steve shows her images on the large monitor. \nSTEVE This is from a few minutes ago. We've got two males, two females, and seven kids. Maya points to one of the shapes in the courtyard. \nMAYA Who's that? \nSTEVE I'm saying that's Bushra. The brother's wife. \nMAYA How do you know the gender? \nSTEVE (points on screen, to a thin line) This is a clothes-line here, for laundry. Men don't mess with the wash. We watch that shape move away from the clothes-line and back to the house. \nSTEVE (CONT'D) It takes her about four seconds to move from there to the front door. So she's on the older side. \nMAYA What's that up there? (pointing to the other \nSHAPES) \nSTEVE Those are kids. They're shuffling around, sword-fighting or something with sticks. \n(POINTING AGAIN) You can see their height relative to this - these are cows - so they're probably between seven and nine. Boys. Another FIGURE comes out of the house and moves to the clothes- line and grabs some laundry. \nMAYA Your female is moving fast. \nSTEVE That's what I wanted to show you. (to the Imagery \nTECHNICIAN) Can we pause this please? \n(TO MAYA) That's not the same lady. That's female #3. \nMAYA So you found two males, three females? \nSTEVE That's correct. Maya suddenly gets it. \nMAYA You're missing a male. \nSTEVE Yes we are. \nMAYA Wow. \nINT.

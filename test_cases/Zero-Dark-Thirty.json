Ghul looks ashen. \nMAYA (CONT'D) However, depending on how candid you are today, I may be able to keep you in Pakistan. \nGHUL What do you want to know? \nMAYA I'm going to ask you a series of questions based on your knowledge of Al Qaeda and your position as key financier for the organization. \nGHUL I have dealt with the mukhabarat, I have no wish to be tortured again. Ask me a question, I can answer it. \nMAYA What can you tell me about Atiyah Abd al-Rahman. \nGHUL He works for Zawahiri. He's in charge of military tactics. \nMAYA In what context have you ever heard the name Abu Ahmed? \nGHUL He works for Faraj and bin Laden. He is his most trusted courier.

GEORGE WRIGHT, Chief of the Afghanistan Pakistan Department, has just flown in from D.C. A big man, striding quickly into the room with the street roll of the Bronx projects he grew up in, George looks ready for a brawl. \nGEORGE I want to make something absolutely clear. \n(MORE) \nGEORGE (CONT'D) If you thought there was some secret cell somewhere working Al Qaeda, I want you to know that you're wrong. This is it. There's no working group coming to the rescue. He stares at his staff. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) There's nobody else, hidden away on some other floor. There is just us. And we are failing. We're spending billions of dollars. People are dying. We're still no closer to defeating our enemy. \nPACING NOW: \nGEORGE (CONT'D) They attacked us on land in 98, by sea in 2000, and from the air in 2001. They murdered three thousand of our citizens in cold blood, and they've slaughtered our forward deployed.

AMERICAN EMBASSY CIA SECTION - LATER \nThe office has grown bigger and busier and the cubicle maze is filled with many new faces of young agents excited to be in Pakistan. Sitting alone at her desk we find Maya just as she's finishing a report. She gets up, crosses the room and goes to the desk of a young woman who reminds us in her idealistic enthusiasm of the way Maya was six years ago. This is DEBBIE. \nDEBBIE Hi. I painstakingly combed through everything in the system and found this. \nShe hands Maya a file. \nDEBBIE (CONT'D) It's him. He was one of ten names on a watch list sent to us by the Moroccans after 9/11: Ibrahim Sayeed. They told us to watch out for him, apparently they think his whole family and extended family is bad and has ties to KSM. \n(BEAT) He was picked up for fake papers and a doctored exit visa leaving Afghanistan, traveling through Morocco en route to Kuwait. Abu Ahmed al- Kuwaiti. This must be Abu Ahmed. \nMAYA Doesn't matter, but I wish I had that five years ago. How come I never saw it before? \nDEBBIE Nobody saw it, most likely. There was a lot of white noise after 9/11, countries wanting to help out, we got millions of tips and... \n(SHRUGS) Things got lost in the shuffle. Human error. Maya turns her attention back to the WHITE BOARD and as Debbie keeps talking we follow Maya's gaze across the row of MUG SHOTS of Al Qaeda personnel. While a few of the men are African or are distinctive looking for other reasons, most of them look fairly similar in that they're all wearing the same type of clothes and have the same trademark long gnarly beards. \nDEBBIE (CONT'D) \n(PRESSING ON) Anyway I thought you should know about it. \n(PLUS) I just want to say I've heard a lot about you. You inspired me to come to Pakistan. Maya's eyes narrow. She keeps looking at the WHITE BOARD \nDEBBIE (CONT'D) Maybe you'll let me buy you a kabob sometime? \nMAYA \n(DISTRACTEDLY) Don't eat out.

The family name is Sayeed. \n", "test2_true": "MAYA O.S. He may not be. We now know that Abu Ahmed is one of eight brothers. All the brothers in the family look alike. Three of them went to Afghanistan. Isn't it possible that when the three eldest brothers grew beards in Afghanistan, they started to look alike? I think the one calling himself Abu Ahmed is still alive. The picture we've been using is wrong. It's of his older brother, Habeeb. He's the one that's is dead. \nDANIEL Okay, what are you basing this on? \nINT. BRIEFING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nMAYA We have no intercepts about Abu Ahmed dying. \n(MORE) \nMAYA (CONT'D) We just have a detainee who buried somebody who looked like Abu Ahmed. But if somebody as important as Abu Ahmed had died, they'd be talking about it online in chat rooms all over the place. Plus, the detainee said that Habeeb died in 2001. We know that Abu Ahmed was alive then, trying to get into Tora Bora with Ammar. That means it's probably one of the other brothers that's dead. \nDANIEL O.S. In other words, you want it to be true. \nMAYA Yes, I fucking want it to be true. Maya slams the desk. \nDANIEL O.S. Calm down. Beat. \nMAYA I am calm. \nDANIEL O.S.

You put her on the field. (reciting a phrase from the KORAN, in Arabic, then loosely \nTRANSLATING) Allah rewards those who strive and fight over those that sit behind a desk. WOLF nods. If the blatant attempt to play on his Muslim belief bothers him, he doesn't show it at all. \nWOLF As you know, Abu Ghraib and Gitmo fucked us. The detainee program is now fly paper. We got senators jumping out of our asses, and the Director is very concerned. They will not stop until they have a body. There it is. The quid pro quo. There's a reason he's called The Wolf.

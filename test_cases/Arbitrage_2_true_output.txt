ROBERT They're negotiating. He wants a better price. 
EXT. FREMAUT - DAY 
Robert exits the building with what looks to be, for the first time in the film, a real smile. 
He walks towards his limo, DIALS his cell. 
ROBERT (INTO PHONE) Sherry Netherland...? Yes, James Mayfield, please... (as he enters his car) Mr. Mayfield... I think it's time we had a talk. 
INT. COURTHOUSE HALL - AFTERNOON 
Bryer walks with DEFERLITO (48), who rifles through a FOLDER. 
DEFERLITO ...cause it's not gonna hold. 
BRYER The warrant doesn't need to hold. It just needs to scare him into giving up Miller. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 62. 
DEFERLITO What is it, Mike, you're stalled- out mid-career so you're reaching for a high-note? Who gives a fuck? 
BRYER This is about Judge Rittenband, isn't it? It's cause he's running again? 
DEFERLITO You wanna cost the Judge his seat on a profiling claim? Against Earl Monroe? 
BRYER (SWITCHING TACKS) I'm getting a piece of new evidence that'll seal it a hundred percent. 
DEFERLITO Good, then come back when you got it. 
BRYER I'll have it before you go in the jury room... Look, Ray. We like this kid. I don't wanna lose him. Think about it: if we flip him, you get Robert Miller. What's that worth to Rittenband, and to you for that matter...? (HARD) Twenty years, Ray. Twenty fucking years, we watch these guys- they out-lawyer us, they out-buy us. I'm fucking sick of it. Where's the consequence? The guy did it. He does not get to walk just cause he's on CNBC. 
Deferlito stops, stares, then signs the ARREST WARRANT. 
DEFERLITO You better not fuck me. 
He walks off. Bryer holds a beat, then pulls out his CELL. 
BRYER (INTO PHONE) Yeah... I need a serious fuckin' favor... Goldenrod - 4.17.11 63. 
INT. ROBERT'S OFFICE CORRIDOR - LATER 
Robert enters, moving much slower. As he approaches Cindy, he sees a worried look on her face. 
CINDY Brooke's waiting for you... 
ROBERT Did we have a meeting? 
CINDY No, but she looked upset. 
INT. ROBERT'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Robert enters. Brooke's at the window in a chair. It's clear that she has been crying. 
ROBERT (APPROACHING HER) Sweetie, you okay? What's wrong? 
Brooke holds out her hands. She has two copies of the "Old Hill Fund" balance sheets. 
Robert stands there a moment, staring at her. 
EXT. 5TH AVENUE - AFTERNOON 
We see Brooke and Robert from overhead like little dots as they cross 5th Avenue towards Central Park. 
EXT. CENTRAL PARK - CONTINUOUS 
They walk solemnly towards a park bench in front of a lake. Robert sits, motions to Brooke. 
ROBERT You wanna sit? 
BROOKE I'll stand. (as he sits) Didn't you think I'd find out? 
ROBERT I did.

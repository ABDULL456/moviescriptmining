The image on the monitor matches the movements of the scanner. It shows a real-time internal scan of Pinkerton's body, displaying the skeleton, internal organs, and so on. 
Visible on the monitor is a spinal worm curled up tight around Pinkerton's spine.

Fischer doesn't look up, but his tone suddenly changes. 
FISCHER You shouldn't be here, Carnby. 
Carnby stands in the doorway. He waves Burke's I-D card. 
CARNBY I'm not here. Commander Burke is. Now what the hell is that thing inside him? 
FISCHER Your curiosity have anything to do with the fingerprint of yours I found on his corpse? 
CARNBY The list of people I trust is short, Fischer. Is it about to get shorter? 
Fischer turns back to Pinkerton's body. Carnby comes up and stands next to him. 
Fischer takes a scalpel off the table and makes a careful incision along Pinkerton's back. 
CARNBY (CONT'D) Have you I-D'd him? 
FISCHER Yeah, we got dentals. Agent James Pinkerton. He's ex-713. 
CARNBY He was an agent? When? 
Using tongs, Fischer peels back the skin of Pinkerton's back. The spinal-worm is attached to Pinkerton's spine. 
FISCHER Went MIA twenty years ago. Presumed dead. I'm trying to get more intell, but his records are so classified, they're practically invisible. C arnby takes the tongs from Fischer, holding open the skin. Fischer makes a series of incisions with the scalpel, disconnecting the spinal-worm from Pinkerton's spine. 
CARNBY It's fused with his nervous system.

FISCHER I've never seen this kind of symbiosis before. 
Fischer pulls the spinal-worm out of Pinkerton's open back with a pair of tongs. It hangs limply, motionless. 
The spinal-worm is long and thick, covered with hard, dark scales. It has dozens of tiny clawed feet that were connected to Pinkerton's spine. 
ischer drops the spinal-worm in a tub. 
ischer notices the hand-held scanning device is BEEPING faintly, still registering something. He looks at the read- out, curious, then concerned. 
FISCHER (CONT'D) Scanner's still reading something... 
Fischer runs the scanner over Pinkerton's corpse. Nothing. 
Now Fischer looks even more concerned. He turns the scanner on himself, running it up and down his torso. Nothing. 
Fischer looks at Carnby. Carnby gets it. It might be him. 
Fischer runs the scanner over Carnby's torso. The scanner immediately starts BEEPING louder. 
They exchange a look between them. Something's inside Carnby.

Aline sits at her desk, analyzing the 3-D scan she made of the lynchpin artifact. 
HUDGENS (O.S.) The Abkani never cease to amaze me. 
line turns, startled, to see Hudgens standing behind her. Hudgens demeanor is friendly, reassuring. 
HUDGENS (CONT'D) Such a complex society at a time when most of humanity was still hunting and gathering and huddling around fires. 
ALINE Dr. Hudgens. When did you get back? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
HUDGENS A few hours ago. I heard there was some excitement. Are you alright? 
ALINE I'm fine. A bit shaken up. But fine. 
HUDGENS I apologize for snapping at you earlier. Now, what are you still doing here after all you've been through?

THE FIFTH FLOOR OF THE POST 
and it's noisy. Not as noisy as it's going to get, but there is more tension around just now than there has been previously. 
CUT TO: 
AN ATTRACTIVE WOMAN IN HER MID-30s. On her desk is her name, MARILYN BERGER. She is watching BERNSTEIN who is standing by the water cooler nearby. As she gets up-- 
CUT TO: 
BERNSTEIN drinking water. 
BERGER Do you guys know about the Canuck letter? 
BERNSTEIN (nods, drinks) Um-hmm. (stops, looks at her) Why? 
BERGER I just wanted to be sure you knew who wrote it. 
As she speaks-- 
CUT TO: 
WOODWARD working at his desk, suddenly looking up as a SCREAM comes from the direction of the water cooler and as everyone turns to see, here comes BERNSTEIN dragging BERGER over to WOODWARD's desk. 
BERNSTEIN (hysterical) Tell him what you just told me. 
BERGER Just than Ken Clawsen--he used to be a reporter here before he went to work for Nixon--I had him over for a drink a few weeks ago and he told me he wrote the Canuck letter. (she looks from one of them to the other) You did want to know, didn't you? 
And now from her-- 
CUT TO: 
WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN in a corner of the room, talking low and fast. 
BERNSTEIN You think we're being set up?--Christ, Deep Throat tells you last night that the letter came from inside the White House and up traipses Marilyn naming names. 
WOODWARD It makes a crazy kind of sense-- remember that initiation rite they have at the White House? Each new member of the President's staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of Nixon. 
BERNSTEIN You think this was Clawsen's initiation? 
WOODWARD Could have won him a fraternity paddle with a White House seal. (beat) God knows it worked. 
CUT TO: 
A FROZEN SHOT OF MUSKIE IN THE SNOW in tears, standing on the flat-bed truck. This was in the New Hampshire primary, just after the Canuck letter was published. 
WOODWARD (V.O.) You claiming it was all a misunderstanding, Ken? 
CLAWSEN (V.O.) Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it totally wrong-- 
CUT TO: 
WOODWARD ON THE PHONE 
WOODWARD She's an awfully good reporter--I can't remember her getting too much wrong before, can you? 
CLAWSEN (V.O.) That's a bullshit question, that's a question straight out of Wichita, Kansas. 
WOODWARD Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen? 
CLAWSEN (V.O.) Where? (beat) What do you mean, where? 
WOODWARD Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant-- 
CLAWSEN (V.O.) --I've completely forgotten where it was, except I know it wasn't her apartment. 
There is a sound of him hanging up the phone. Hard. WOODWARD hangs up quietly, rubs his eyes, calls out to BERGER who is at her desk-- 
WOODWARD Non denial-denial, Marilyn-- 
BERGER is about to answer when her phone rings. She picks it up, turns to WOODWARD, mouths "it's him" and we 
CUT TO: 
BERGER ON THE PHONE. Again Clawsen on the other end. 
CLAWSEN (V.O.) For Chissakes, don't tell them I came to your place. 
BERGER I already told them. 
CLAWSEN (V.O.) Oh, that's terrific, that's just so terrific, I'm thrilled you did that. 
BERGER I have a clear conscience. 
CLAWSEN (V.O.) Marilyn, I have a wife and a family and a cat and a dog. 
Now from this--

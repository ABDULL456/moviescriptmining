CABBIE Hey!  You don't want to walk around down there, Snake! 
INT. BASEMENT -- NIGHT The signal from the tracer keeps getting closer and closer.  Snake walks past a gang beating up and stripping a semi-conscious girl.  He doesn't take much notice.  He keeps going.  He sees a BUM sitting by a fire. 
BUM Hi, Chief.  Nice night.  Nice boots.  Niiiiice boots.  Hey. 
A guy tries to sneak up behind Snake.  Snake knocks him out and points his gun at the bum. 
BUM Easy now, chief.  I'm walking.  I'm walking. 
The bum walks away.  Snake keeps going.  A man beats up another man at a sink.  The beatee is wearing the President's life tracer.  Snake kicks the beater and knocks him out. 
SNAKE Mr. President . . . 
The man wearing the life tracer looks up and smiles.  He's a DRUNK. 
DRUNK I'm the President?  Sure, I'm the President.  If I knew where I got this thing -- (indicates the tracer) I'd be the President. 
SNAKE Where did you get it? 
DRUNK I woke up, and there it was, just like a miracle . . . 
Snake slams the tracer against the sink. 
INT. BASE -- NIGHT The President's life signs all fail. 
OFFICIAL Oh my god . . . 
MEDIC It . . . It may be just an impact on the mechanism itself . . . 
INT. BASEMENT -- NIGHT Snake pulls up his walkie-talkie. 
SNAKE Hauk?! 
INT. BASE -- NIGHT 
HAUK I'm right here, Plissken. 
SNAKE I don't know who you assholes are looking at, but it's NOT the President.

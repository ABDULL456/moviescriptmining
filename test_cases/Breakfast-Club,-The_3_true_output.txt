ANDREW You know, Bender...you don't even count.  I mean if you disappeared forever it wouldn't make any difference.  You may as well not even exist at this school. 
Bender probably is upset at this and he pauses a moment before speaking.  He doesn't let his emotions out, however. 
BENDER Well...I'll just run right out and join the wrestling team. 
Andrew and Claire look at each other and laugh at Bender. 
BENDER (to Claire) Maybe the prep club too!  Student council... 
ANDREW No, they wouldn't take you. 
BENDER I'm hurt. 
CLAIRE You know why guys like you knock everything... 
BENDER (to himself) Oh, this should be stunning... 
CLAIRE It's 'cause you're afraid. 
BENDER (with mock enthusiasm) Oh, God!  You ritchies are so smart, that's exactly why I'm not heavy in activities! 
CLAIRE You're a big coward! 
Brian feels left out. 
BRIAN (to no one imparticular) I'm in the math club... 
CLAIRE See you're afraid that they won't take you.  You don't belong so you just have to dump all over it... 
BENDER Well...it wouldn't have anything to do with you activities people being assholes...now would it? 
CLAIRE Well you wouldn't know...You don't even know any of us. 
BENDER Well, I don't know any lepers either, but I'm not gonna run out and join one of their fucking clubs. 
ANDREW Hey let's watch the mouth, huh? 
Brian again feels he needs to contribute. 
BRIAN I'm in the physics club too... 
BENDER (to Claire) S'cuse me a sec... (to Brian) What are you babbling about? 
BRIAN Well, what I said was...I'm in the math club, the Latin club and the physics club...physics club. 
Bender nods and turns to Claire. 
BENDER Hey...Cherry...do you belong to the physics club? 
CLAIRE That's an academic club... 
BENDER So? 
CLAIRE So...academic clubs aren't the same as other kinds of clubs. 
BENDER Oh, but to dorks like him...

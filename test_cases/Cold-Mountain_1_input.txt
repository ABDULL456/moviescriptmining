ADA I'm not sorry, but I don't know how we'll get through another winter. 
MONROE Will you play me something? Something peaceful while I look over my sermon. 
Ada takes the dishes away. He gets out his papers, his pen and ink. 
INT. PARLOUR, BLACK COVE FARM. DUSK 
ADA PLAYS THE PIANO. Chopin's Prelude in E Minor. Outside in the garden, Monroe has adjourned to his striped campaign chair, and is hunched over his notes. The door of the parlour is open and the music floats over to him as he works. 
Ada plays. A FEW SPOTS OF RAIN appear at the window. Then the steady drumming of a summer shower. 
ADA (still playing) Daddy, bring the tablecloth in with you! 
She plays some more. Monroe hasn't come in. The rain splashes on to the window.. 
ADA Daddy, come inside before you drown! 
After a few more bars, she stops playing and, curious, goes to the door. She stands at the doorway. MONROE'S SERMON IS CAUGHT IN THE WIND AND BLOWS AROUND HIM, THE INK RUN TO 
ABSTRACTIONS, his hand dropped and visible to Ada as, with dread, she approaches. SHE CATCHES THE SODDEN PAPERS, CHASING AFTER THEM, THEN REACHES HER DEAD FATHER. 
He's like a fish, his face shining with the rain, and glass eyed. She leans in to him, her head to his heart, then runs, oblivious to the rain, her dress already drenched, runs down the lane. 
ADA (V.O.) Dear Mr. Inman... 
INT. HOSPITAL, CHARLESTON. NIGHT 
INMAN'S FACE as he drifts in and out of consciousness. Mrs. Morgan, the hospital volunteer, sits by Inman's bed. She holds ADA'S UNOPENED LETTER, badly weather damaged, the pages stuck together, the writing blurred where the ink has run. 
MRS. MORGAN It's come to you by way of Virginia. 
There are various dates, which she decodes. 
MRS. MORGAN It's not too recent -- written this past winter. I'm afraid I can't read who it's from. Dear Mr. Inman, 
INT. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT 
Ada is writing at her father's desk. A lonely room. 
ADA (V.O.) -- I'm still waiting, as I promised I would, but I find myself alone and at the end of my wits -- 
INT. HOSPITAL, CHARLESTON. NIGHT 
Mrs. Morgan reads to Inman, trying to decipher the letter: 
MRS. MORGAN -- at the end of my wits, so now I say to you, plain as I can, come back to me. Come back to me is my request. (can't read the next bit) Then something I can't read, something, come back to me. 
Inman is very still. Then, eyes glinting with determination, gives a TINY NOD. 
OFFICIAL (O.S.) By order of Zebulon Vance, Governor of this great state of North Carolina: any soldier turned deserter is guilty of treason and shall be hunted down like a dog. 
EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY 
Ada walks down the hill from the Chapel. There is an absence of young people, but the older folk are gathered round the General Store where a UNIFORMED OFFICIAL is reading from a document. 
OFFICIAL -- Any man takes in a deserter is likewise guilty of treason. 
The Official is flanked by Teague, Bosey and the twins, puffed up with self-importance. Ada has to walk around him to enter the store. 
OFFICIAL The Home Guard is powered to enter any place it sees fit, without notice or constraint. Names of all deserters will be posted in every town, published in every newspaper. 
INT. GENERAL STORE, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY 
The Official continues outside as Ada enters. Ada approaches Mrs Castlereagh, the owner. 
ADA Is there a letter for me? 
MRS. CASTLEREAGH Nothing -- we're getting no post through at all -- although if you slip out back the material you ordered has arrived. 
They go to the back of the store, to a screened-off area. Mrs. Castlereagh hands her over a packet of material. There's another, more furtive, transaction to take place. Mrs Castlereagh hands over a second parcel as if it were narcotics. Ada tears at the wrapping. It's a parcel of books. 
MRS. CASTLEREAGH If folks knew I was taking deliveries from the North. 
ADA I know. Thank you so much. 
MRS. CASTLEREAGH The sooner we lose this war the better. Already one boy gone, another with his leg took off at the knee. That's enough. 
ADA What do you hear? 
MRS. CASTLEREAGH All I know is they say not one boy in ten from these mountains is coming home again and most of them are deserters. 
EXT. GENERAL STORE, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY 
Ada emerges, almost collides with Teague. She wriggles past him, tries to make her package invisible. 
EXT. APPROACH TO BLACK COVE FARM - DAY

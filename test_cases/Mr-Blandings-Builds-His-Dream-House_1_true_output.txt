JIM (wearily, seating himself at desk) Tomorrow morning. 
MARY (sighs) Well, I guess you'll just have to dream something up -- good or bad. 
JIM I rather got the impression it had better be good. 
MARY (raised eyebrow) Oh. 
He picks up a pencil, nibbles on it thoughtfully. The silence in the room is broken only by the patter of raindrops on the window. It strikes a note in Jim's subconscious. He swivels around in his chair and stares soberly out the window. 
JIM (ruminatively, almost to himself) Funny how you look forward to the little things. Rain, for instance. 
Mary looks at him curiously. He turns to her. 
JIM For a month now, I guess I've been looking forward to the first rainy night at the house. (looks at Muriel's picture) Big blazing fire. Muriel knitting. Me in my new smoking jacket... with my pipe and slippers, reading my paper... (sighs) Oh, well. 
As he starts to work. 
DISSOLVE 
INT. THE BLANDINGS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Note: The house is painted and almost completely furnished. 
A hard rain beats on the windows. There is a blazing fire in the fireplace. Muriel, in a warm bathrobe, sits near it, comfortably knitting. In fact, the scene is exactly the one Jim has just described, except that the man with slippers, pipe and smoking jacket, reading the paper, is Bill Cole. Near the fire, Bill's rain-drenched jacket, shirt and shoes are hanging up to dry. The cozy tranquillity is broken by a sharp RINGING of the front doorbell. 
MURIEL (with relief) Thank heavens! The children. 
BILL (rising) Stay put. You look too comfortable. 
The CAMERA FOLLOWS Bill to the front door. He opens it. A man in raincoat and boots stands there in the pouring, driving rain. The man enters as Bill struggles to get the door shut against the wind. 
MR. JONES Whew! What a night! I'm Jones, from down the road. Just came over to tell you your kids are all right, Mr. Blandings. 
BILL Oh, I'm not Mr. Blandings. Cole's the name, Bill Cole. 
He sees Jones' doubtful look at the smoking jacket, feels an explanation is necessary. 
BILL Friend of the family. Wet clothes. Just came in out of the rain. 
Muriel walks into scene. Jones takes in the bathrobe, again looks skeptically at Bill. 
MURIEL I'm Mrs. Blandings. 
JONES How do. Mrs. Williams just called. Says your phone's out of order. Wanted me to tell you the water's rising and they've got the bridge roped off. Girls'll spend the night over at her place. 
MURIEL Thank you. I was beginning to get concerned. Can I make you a cup of tea? 
JONES No, thanks. Better be gettin' back 'fore I have to swim for it. 'Night, Mrs. Blandings. (to Bill) 'Night, Mr. Bl-- 
BILL (weak smile) Cole. Bill Cole. Friend of the family. Just came in out of the rain. 
JONES (uncertainly) Well -- 'Night. 
MURIEL Goodnight... and thanks so much. 
The door is opened with a terrific swirl of wind and rain. Jones exits as Muriel and Bill push the door against the wind, finally getting it shut. 
BILL That's fine. No bridge. How do I get back to Lansdale? 
MURIEL (simply) You'll just have to spend the night right here. 
As they start back into the living room: 
BILL Muriel, really! With your husband in New York and your children away -- think of my reputation. 
MURIEL (smile) Don't worry, Snow White, you'll be as pure and unsullied in the morning as you were the night before. 
BILL (with resignation) That's the story of my life. 
Muriel pokes the dying fire, looks up thoughtfully. 
MURIEL Poor Jim, he sounded so worried before. I certainly hope he comes up with something. 
BILL Don't worry about the man who gave the world "When you've got the whim, say Wham!"-- This well will never run dry. 
SLOW DISSOLVE 
INT. JIM'S OFFICE - EARLY MORNING 
The CAMERA COMES IN ON a package of cigarettes. A finger impatiently rips open what is left of the package, discloses that it is empty. The ANGLE WIDENS to reveal a tired, disheveled Jim. Disgusted, he fishes the most likely butt from a tray littered with them. With considerable difficulty he manages to light it, only to burn his nose. Impatiently stamping out the butt he rises, stretches, walks to the window, pulls up the shade. Early morning sunlight floods the room. He turns off a standing lamp, looks thoughtfully out the window, suddenly gets an idea. Turning, he snaps his fingers. Mary, who is asleep on the desk, her head resting on her elbows, raises her head, opens a sleepy eye. 
JIM (selling; a note of desperation in his voice) "Compare the price, compare the slice, Take our advice -- Buy Wham!" 
Mary critically shakes her head "no", closes her eye. Jim wearily throws himself down on the couch, absently toys with his already loosened tie. He pulls it up over his nose, throwing the balance over the top of his head. Suddenly he reacts, snaps his fingers. Mary opens a sleepy eye.

The THUNDEROUS SOUNDS OF A MASSIVE NAVAL BARRAGE are heard.  The power is astonishing.  It roars through the body, blows back the hair and rattles the ears. \nFADE IN: \nEXT. OMAHA BEACH - NORMANDY - DAWN \nThe ROAR OF NAVAL GUNS continues but now WE SEE THEM FIRING. Huge fifteen inch guns. \nSWARM OF LANDING CRAFT \nHeads directly into a nightmare.  MASSIVE EXPLOSIONS from German artillery shells and mined obstacles tear apart the beach.  Hundreds of German machine guns, loaded with tracers, pour out a red snowstorm of bullets. \nOFFSHORE SUPERIMPOSITION: \nOMAHA BEACH, NORMANDY June 6, 1944 \n0600 HOURS HUNDREDS OF LANDING CRAFT Each holding thirty men, near the beaches. \nTHE CLIFFS At the far end of the beach, a ninety- foot cliff.  Topped by bunkers. Ringed by fortified machine gun nests. A clear line-of-fire down the entire beach. \nTEN LANDING CRAFT Make their way toward the base of the cliffs.  Running a gauntlet of explosions. \nSUPERIMPOSITION: THE FOLLOWING IS BASED ON A TRUE STORY THE LEAD LANDING CRAFT Plows through the waves. \nTHE CAMERA MOVES PAST THE FACES OF THE MEN \nBoys.  Most are eighteen or nineteen years old.  Tough. Well-trained.  Trying to block out the fury around them. \nA DIRECT HIT ON A NEARBY LANDING CRAFT \nA huge EXPLOSION of fuel, fire, metal and flesh. \nTHE LEAD LANDING CRAFT \nThe Motorman holds his course.  Shells EXPLODE around them. FLAMING OIL BURNS on the water.  CANNON FIRE SMASHES into the bow. \nTHE MOTORAMAN IS RIPPED TO BITS \nBLOOD AND FLESH shower the men behind him.  The mate takes the controls. \nA YOUNG SOLDIER His face covered with the remains of the motorman.  Starts to lose it. Begins to shudder and weep.  His name is DeLancey. \nTHE BOYS AROUND HIM \nDo their best to stare straight ahead.  But the fear infects them.  It starts to spread. \nA FIGURE Pushes through the men.  Puts himself in front of DeLancey. \nThe figure is CAPTAIN JOHN MILLER.  Early thirties.  By far the oldest man on the craft.  Relaxed, battle-hardened, powerful, ignoring the hell around them.  He smiles, puts a cigar in his mouth, strikes a match on the front of DeLancey's helmet and lights the cigar. \nDeLancey tries to look away but Miller grips him by the jaw and forces him to lock eyes.  Miller smiles.  DeLancey is terrified. \nDelancey Captain, are we all gonna die? \nMiller Hell no, two-thirds, tops. \nDelancey Oh, Jesus... \nMiller I want every one of you to look at the man on your left.  Now look at the man on your right.  Feel sorry for those to sons-of-bitches, they're going to get it, you're not going to get a scratch.  A few, including DeLancey, manage thin smiles.  Miller releases his grip on DeLancey who moves his jaw as if to see if it's broken.  Miller pats him on the cheek and moves on to the bow. \nMILLER Looks over the gunwale at THE HELL IN FRONT OF THEM. \nPAN DOWN TO MILLER'S HAND \nIt quivers in fear.  Miller glances around, sees that none of the men have noticed.  He stares at his hand as if it belongs to someone else.  It stops shaking.  He turns his eyes back to the objective. \nTHE LEAD LANDING CRAFT HITS THE BEACH \nThe six surviving boats alongside. \nEXPLOSIVE PROPELLED GRAPPLING HOOKS FIRE \nINT. GENERAL MARSHALL'S OFFICE - WAR DEPARTMENT - DAY \nAnother busy office filled with aides and secretaries. GENERAL GEORGE MARSHALL, Army Chief of Staff, stands next to his conference table, reading the Ryan brother' files.  Half- a-dozen subordinates, among them the one-armed Colonel and the Young Captain, wait.  General Marshall puts down the file. \nGENERAL MARSHALL (softly) Goddamn it. \nOne-armed colonel All four of them were in the same company in the 29th Infantry but we split them up after the Sullivan brothers died on the Juneau. \nGENERAL MARSHALL Any contact with the fourth brother, James? \nOne-armed colonel No, sir.  He was dropped about thirty miles inland, near Ramelle.  That's still deep behind German lines. \nGeneral Marshall hardens. \nGENERAL MARSHALL Well, if he's alive, we're going to send someone to get him the hell out of there.  That's just what the General's staff wanted to hear. \nEXT. NORMANDY - CRATER FIELD - DAY \nNEAR CONSTANT MORTAR EXPLOSIONS.  HEAVY MACHINE GUN FIRE. Miller's Ranger company is pinned down by a superior force of German troops.  The Americans hug the bottoms of the craters, FIRING BACK as best they can.  BIG GUNS THUNDER in the distance. \nSUPERIMPOSITION: Normandy 1300 hours June 9 \nMILLER Trailed by a RADIOMAN, dashes through the fire and dives into a sludge- filled crater.  He surfaces, sees Sarge and Reiben, and reels from a horrific smell.  Their conversation is repeatedly broken by FIRING And DUCKING GERMAN FIRE. \nMILLER Jesus Christ!  What the hell are we swimming in? \nREIBEN Shit, sir. \nSARGE Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog. \nREIBEN Out of the frying pan, into the fucking latrine. \nMILLER Look at the bright side, the Krauts sure as hell don't want to advance and hold this cesspool. \nMiller barks to his RADIOMAN. \nMILLER Get Fire Control, we need some artillery... \nRadioman Trying, sir. \nMORE EXPLOSIONS.  They all duck.  Reiben's worried. \nREIBEN Sir, what if they send some other company into Caen ahead of us while we're pinned down here? \nMILLER Don't worry, we're the only Rangers this side of the continent, we've got to be first into Caen. \nSARGE Who cares? \nREIBEN I care.  Don't you know what Caen's famous for, Sarge? \nSARGE Frogs? \nREIBEN Lingerie. \nSARGE Yeah?  So? \nTHE GERMAN FIRE diminishes for an instant.  Miller, Sarge and Reiben immediately rise and POUR FIRE at the German positions.  GERMAN MACHINE GUN FIRE RESPONDS and they duck down again. \nREIBEN So, you ever heard of employee discounts?  My uncle sells shoes, gets twenty-five percent off everything in the line, got a closet filled with the best looking shoes you ever seen. \nMORE MORTAR EXPLOSIONS. \nREIBEN Just picture some French number been spending all day, every day, making cream-colored, shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night? \nMILLER Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie? \nREIBEN Lingerie is my life, sir.  My mother's got a shop in Brooklyn, I grew up in it, from the time I could crawl, we carry Caen lingerie, it's the best there is, it's all I been thinking about since the invasion. \nAnother pause in the German shelling.  Reiben rises and BLASTS HIS B.A.R, then ducks as the GERMANS RETURN FIRE. \nMILLER There's a war on, good chance they're not still making lingerie in Caen. \nREIBEN Oh, Captain, they'll always make lingerie, it's one of the three basic needs of man -- food, shelter, silk teddies.  Miller Dream on, private. \nREIBEN Happy to, sir. \nRadioman Captain, I've got Command, they want you back at H.Q., right away. \nMILLER Maybe the war's over. \nA MORTAR SHELL EXPLODES VERY CLOSE.  After the debris stops falling, Sarge and Reiben rise, spitting out sludge.  Reiben looks dubiously at Miller. \nREIBEN I don't think so, Captain. \nMiller points the way for Sarge. \nEXT. INTELLIGENCE TENT - DAY \nMiller and his men skid to a stop in front of a perfectly white, taut-lined tent.  A steady stream of ROARING vehicles and CHATTERING men move out around them.  DISTANT GUNS RUMBLE. SPORADIC MEDIUM-DISTANCE EXPLOSIONS BOOM.  Miller hops out. \nMILLER Wait here. \nHe strides into the tent. \nINT. INTELLIGENCE TENT - DAY \nThree bookish corporals hover over map tables like studious nerds the day before finals.  They're breaking down and gridding field maps and covering them in plasticine.  Tedious, detailed work. \nOne of them is TIM UPHAM, a thin, twenty-four year old, patrician with gentle, thoughtful eyes behind his thick glasses.  He nervously jumps at the sound of a VERY DISTANT EXPLOSION, then he forces himself to concentrate on his work. Miller strides in.  Miller I'm looking for Corporal Upham. \nUpham raises his eyes from his map and re-focuses. \nUpham Sir, I'm Upham. \nMILLER I understand you speak French and German. \nUpham Yes, sir. \nMILLER Do you have an accent? \nUpham A slight one in French.  My German is clean.  It has a touch of the Bavarian. \nMILLER Good, you've been re-assigned to me, we're going to Ramelle. \nUpham knows enough geography to know what that means. \nUpham Uh, sir, there are Germans up at Ramelle. \nMILLER That's my understanding. \nUpham Lots of them. \nMILLER Do you have a problem with that, Corporal? \nUpham Sir, I've never been in combat.  I make maps.  I translate. \nMILLER I need a translator, all mine have been killed. \nUpham But, sir, I haven't held a gun since basic training. \nMILLER It'll come back to you.  Get your gear. \nUpham hesitates. \nUpham Sir, may I bring my typewriter? \nMiller looks at him closely, not sure if he's joking. \nUpham I'm writing a book and I... \nMiller's expression gives him his answer. \nUpham Uh, how about a pencil? \nMILLER A small one. \nMiller shoos him off. \nMILLER Go, go... \nUpham scurries away.  Miller sighs. \nEXT. ROAD LEADING FROM INTELLIGENCE TENT - DAY \nMiller and his men peel out, now with Upham crammed with the others in the back of the jeep.  As they drive off, the CAMERA CRANES UP to reveal the vast tableau of the biggest invasion in military history. \nThe scope of the operation is stunning.  The beach is covered with mountains of supplies.  A steady stream of vehicles winds up the dunes.  Hundreds of barrage balloons, anchored by heavy steel cables, hover over the entire scene.  Off- shore, a massive Mulberry port is under construction, workers swarming over it like ants.  Beyond that, thousands of ships and boats of every type and description.  The smoke of hundreds of fires rises on the horizon.  EXPLOSIONS, some distant, some close, BOOM and RUMBLE. \nIt's an awesome, breathtaking sight.  Miller and his tiny band of men, weave their way through the middle of it, speeding away from the beach, heading inland, leaving the bulk of the American Army behind.  Ext. french road - day Miller and his men drive fast passing American vehicles and infantrymen moving forward.  The sides of the road are littered with the debris of burning German vehicles, abandoned equipment, bodies. \nSarge drives.  Miller reads a map.  Upham, cradling a pristine M-1 rifle, is all eyes and ears.  Jackson and Wade calmly take in the view.  Reiben checks out the close quarters in the back of the jeep. \nREIBEN Captain, can I ask you a question? \nMILLER Sure, Reiben. \nREIBEN Where are you planning on putting Private Ryan, sir? \nREIBEN Well, you're a happy idiot. \nTHEY ROUND A TURN \nSKID TO A STOP AT A: \nBOTTLENECK OF AMERICAN VEHICLES \nA LIEUTENANT is roadmaster.  Miller calls to him. \nMILLER How's the road up to St. Mere? \nLieutenant Bad, sir.  There're some eighty-eights hiding somewhere, knocking the hell out of our traffic. \nMILLER Anybody getting through? \nLieutenant The lucky ones. \nMiller nods to Sarge who floors it.  They take off, spraying gravel behind them.  Ext. St. Mere Road - day The jeep barrels down the road, fast.  The road is pock-marked with craters. They pass the wreckage of a pair of American jeeps.  Direct hits.  Sarge swerves around them without slowing. \nAN AMERICAN TROOP TRUCK SMOLDERS \nOn the side of the road, surrounded by the charred bodies of a dozen American troops.  It's a nightmare vision.  Upham grows weak at the sight.  Miller takes note of Upham's reaction. \nIN THE BACK The men bounce up and down like stuffed animals, doing their best to not be thrown out. \nREIBEN Hell, this is better than Coney Island! \nA HUGE BUMP Bounces Reiben up and slams his back down on his shovel.  He HOLLERS IN PAIN. \nMILLER Just trying to make room for Ryan. \nReiben shoots Miller a smile and shifts his belt, moving his shovel from under his bruised ass. \nTHEY ROUND A BEND \nSee a long, straight stretch of road.  Half-a-dozen burning, obliterated American vehicles.  A gauntlet to run. \nAN EIGHTY-EIGHT SHELL SCREAMS IN \nLands right behind them.  BLOWS A NEW CRATER \nMILLER (sweetly) Sarge? \nSARGE FLOORS IT.  Everyone hangs on. \nANOTHER SHELL EXPLODES Thirty yards ahead of them. \nMILLER Directs Sarge off the road. \nMILLER They've got the road zeroed. \nSARGE Yanks the wheel, driving the jeep off the road. \nTHE JEEP BOUNCES Off the shoulder.  Nearly throwing everyone out.  Somehow they hang on. The jeep tears along the rutted field. \nANOTHER EXPLOSION Just behind them. \nSARGE DRIVES MADLY Not slowing down.  Trying to avoid the biggest ruts and bumps. \nANOTHER EXPLOSION Close on their side.  Showers them with debris. \nSARGE Jesus Christ! \nMILLER SCANS THE TERRAIN \nSees a cluster of buildings about half-a-mile ahead. \nMILLER They've got a hell of a spotter somewhere. \nANOTHER EXPLOSION Even closer.  The jeep's PEPPERED WITH SHRAPNEL.  They BARREL THROUGH the smoke. \nMILLER S-curves, Sarge. \nSARGE Turns shallow curves without slowing down. \nSUDDENLY SEES A CRATER \nTries to avoid it.  Too late.  Brakes.  PLOWS into overturned earth.  STOPS SHORT. \nREIBEN, UPHAM, WADE AND JACKSON \nTHROWN from the jeep.  TUMBLE into the dirt.  Not hurt. \nUPHAM You think he really believed it? \nWADE Who knows?  It worked. \nREIBEN Fine, you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned Private James Ryan can carry my fucking gear. \nWADE Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes. \nREIBEN You want unpleasant?  Just wait, I can do much better than this. \nWADE Look at Upham, you don't hear him complaining. \nUpham, feeling bold and a bit naughty, decides to give it a shot. \nUPHAM Well, as a matter of fact, I was just thinking... \nThe men roll their eyes, expecting the worst. \nUPHAM (continuing) That I'm so fucking tired of this goddamned walking, I'd pay a thousand dollars to see that bastard Ryan crawl on his belly over an acre of broken glass to hear my great-aunt Martha fart through a field-phone. \nThe men are stunned. \nREIBEN Jesus Christ, he's a natural! \nMILLER Upham, are you sure you've never been in combat? \nUpham wiggles with pride.  Upham Positive, sir, I'm certain I'd remember. \nMiller eyes Upham respectfully and nods to the men. \nMILLER He's good. \nThey walk on. \nJACKSON Cap'n, my feet are most uncomfortable. \nMiller smiles, situation normal. \nEXT. ST. MERE - LATE AFTERNOON \nA small town has been reduced to rubble and is still an active battlefield.  HEAVY SMALL ARMS FIRE.  GRENADE AND MORTAR EXPLOSIONS.  MEDIUM ARTILLERY BEYOND.  American soldiers crouch in doorways, FIRING at well-placed Germans. \nSome French civilians dash across a street.  A man and a couple of women, one carrying a child.  They make it across and disappear into the remains of a building. \nMiller runs up and flattens himself against a wall at a corner.  Sarge and the other men follow in leap-frog, spread out down the block behind him. \nMiller glances around the corner, taking a quick mental picture of a GATHERING OF G.I.'s crouching in the cover of an alley across the street and down the block.  They are CAPTAIN HAMILL, about Miller's age, and HIS MEN. \nAs Miller ducks back behind the corner, A GERMAN BULLET SMASHES into the bricks where his head was an instant before. \nMiller motions Jackson across first. \nMILLER Stay low. \nJackson gathers himself, takes off.  GERMAN BULLETS BLAST, kicking up the cobblestone behind him.  Jackson zig-zags and makes it to the cover of the far side. \nJACKSON Dang!  That was close! \nMiller nods to Upham. \nMILLER Your turn. \nUpham, scared shitless, doesn't move.  Miller speaks to him very gently. \nMILLER Zig-zag, change your pace a couple times, you'll be alright. \nUpham's frozen.  He can barely breathe.  Miller sighs. \nMILLER Okay, I'm going to draw fire for you. (sternly) But if I do, you goddamned well better go. \nUpham nods.  Miller gathers himself, takes a deep breath. \nCLOSE SHOT:  MILLER'S HAND quivers. \nMILLER Looks to Upham \nMILLER Ready? \nUpham nods, still terrified. \nMILLER STEPS INTO THE OPEN \nStands motionless, presenting himself to the German snipers. \nJACKSON Thirty-ought-six, Norton long-barrel with dual-groove, parallel rifling, elevated three-glass scope and a single-throw hammer. \nUPHAM The Army gave you that? \nJACKSON Yep. \nUPHAM You must be a hell a shot. \nJACKSON Not where I come from. \nJackson sights on a tree about a thousand yards away and FIRES.  Evaluates.  Calibrates the scope.  He re-loads. \nJackson FIRES AGAIN.  Evaluates.  Perfect.  He wipes the dirt and sweat from his forehead, puts his eye to the sight and waits, absolutely motionless. \nUPHAM That must be four thousand yards. \nJACKSON (without taking his eye from the scope) Forty-two-hundred, I figure. \nUPHAM You take account of the wind? \nJackson doesn't dignify that with an answer but he looks back with an expression that clearly says, \"What are you, some kind of fucking idiot?\" Reiben puts himself between Upham and Jackson. \nREIBEN (put-on Southern accent) Dang right, he take 'count of the wind, ain't ya'll ever heard a Kentucky windage? \nJackson keeps his eye to the scope and his finger on the trigger. \nJACKSON Reiben, how many time I got to tell you, I'm from Tennessee. \nREIBEN They got squirrels there, too, right? \nJackson FIRES.  Waits.  A tiny smile.  He starts taking apart the rifle.  A very impressed Captain Hamill barks to his radioman.  Captain Hamill Get a hold of Command, tell them the St. Mere road is open. \nThe Radioman cranks up his radio.  Captain Hamill turns to Miller. \nCaptain Hamill How far back is the rest of division? \nMILLER Very far, they're not coming this way, they're going to take Caen first. \nCaptain Hamill Goddamn it, I was afraid of that.  We're in a lot of trouble up here, and it's gonna get worse before it gets better.  How many men did you bring? \nMILLER Five, but we not staying, we're on our way to Ramelle. \nCaptain hamill Shit, are you the guys going up to find Private Ryan? \nMILLER Yeah, you know about that? \nCaptain hamill Command radioed, wanted to know if he came in with the early wounded or dead. \nSeveral of CAPTAIN HAMILL'S MEN, among them a GENTLE-FACED PRIVATE, prick up their ears at the mention of Private Ryan. \nCaptain hamill We're supposed to tell you, they intercepted a German transmission after you left.  The Krauts have two companies on their way to Ramelle to take back that bridge, they'll be there sometime late tomorrow. \nMILLER Wonderful. \nCaptain Hamill If Ryan's alive, you'd better get him the hell out of there before those Krauts show up. \nMILLER How do we get out of here? \nCaptain hamill You don't, until tonight, we're hemmed in real tight.  After dark you try to slip out to the east.  If you tip-toe, stay off the main roads and roll a few sevens, you've got a fair chance of making it up to Ramelle by tomorrow night. \nMiller processes the information.  Captain Hamill shakes his head. \nCaptain hamill Tough, huh?  Three brothers? \nMiller shrugs. \nCaptain hamill We sure as hell could use your help here, but I understand what you're doing? \nMILLER Yeah? \nCaptain hamill Good luck. \nMILLER Thanks. \nCaptain hamill I mean it.  Find him.  Get him home. \nMiller is a bit taken aback by Captain Hamill's forceful sincerity.  Then he shakes it off and motions to his men. \nMILLER Let's find someplace to hole up. \nMiller nods to Captain Hamill, then, as he moves to the head of the alley, Miller passes Upham. \nUPHAM Sir, I'm sorry about what happened, I... \nUPHAM Pass. \nMILLER Sarge? \nSARGE I'm just here to keep a bunch of numb-nuts, including one certain, frequently suicidal, tempter-of-fate, from getting themselves killed. \nReiben eyes Miller. \nREIBEN And what about you, Captain? \nMiller looks at Reiben, shocked. \nMILLER Reiben, what's the matter with you? I don't gripe to you.  I'm a captain. There's a chain of command.  Griping goes one way, up, only up, never down.  You gripe to me, I gripe to my superior officers.  Up, get it? I don't gripe to you, I don't gripe in front of you.  How long you been in the army? \nREIBEN I'm sorry, sir, I apologize. (beat) But if you weren't a captain, or if I were a major, what would you say? \nMiller considers his response. \nMILLER In that case, I would say this is an excellent mission, with an extremely valuable objective, worthy of my best efforts. \nReiben rolls his eyes.  Miller plays it straight, with no obvious sarcasm. \nMILLER (continuing) In addition, as I pointed out earlier, I have a fondness for cheese and I hope to have the opportunity to sample some of the Ramelle products, when we arrive there, to see if they live up to their excellent reputation. Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of Private James Ryan and I'm more than willing to lay down my life, and the lives of my men, especially you, Reiben, to help relieve her suffering.  The men thoroughly enjoy the performance. \nREIBEN Sir, if you were not a captain, I would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar. \nMILLER But I am a captain.  If I were not a captain, I would thank you for the compliment and tell you that the ability to lie comes from being a top-notch poker player, which I am, having learned at the side of my mother who is, by popular acclaim, the best poker player in... \nThe men all  learn forward expectantly, believing they're about to find out Miller's home town.  Miller smiles. \nMILLER (continuing) ...my home town, which shall remain un-named. \nThe men ease back, disappointed. \nMILLER Any further thoughts on the subject? \nREIBEN Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of France and while we're at it, fuck Private James Ryan. \nMILLER I'll make a note of your suggestions but I'll leave that last one to you, especially if he's already dead. \nThe men wince and laugh.  Miller checks his watch and gets serious. \nMILLER We move out in two hours, try and get some sleep. \nThe men know when to can it.  Without another word, they all settle down into the debris, close their eyes and try to follow Miller's order.  Upham looks around at these strange men, then, a simple, hard glare from Miller makes him follow suit. \nMiller looks at his men, then pulls out his map case and his flashlight.  He turns it on, in the dim glow of the light, he studies his maps while his men rest. \nEXT. ST. MERE CATHEDRAL - NIGHT (LATER) \nDark.  ARTILLERY RUMBLES IN THE DISTANCE.  Reiben, Jackson, Wade and Upham sleep.  Miller still sits in the glow of his flashlight, studying his maps.  Sarge lies near him, awake, watching him.  Sarge notices some unopened envelopes in Miller's map case and speaks quietly to him. \nSARGE You ever going to open those letters? Miller keeps his eyes on the maps. \nMILLER Maybe. \nSARGE It's not normal, not reading letters from home. \nMILLER Since when have things been normal? \nSARGE You got me.  Afraid of bad news? \nMILLER Nope. \nSARGE Good news? \nMiller looks at Sarge.  A moment passes between the two of them, then miller takes refuge in the maps.  Sarge looks at the men. \nSARGE You think they'll be alright? \nMILLER They're fine.  As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright. \nSARGE And what about you? \nMiller considers the question, doesn't answer. \nMILLER They guys here aren't going to be able to hold out until battalion shows up. \nSARGE Nope. \nMILLER Command isn't going to let them withdraw and the Germans sure as hell aren't going to let them surrender. \nSARGE Three for three. \nCaptain Hamill nods to the Gentle-Faced Private who takes the ammo back. \nMILLER Let's move out. \nMiller and his men head off along the wall into the darkness, lit intermittently by the distant flashes.  Captain Hamill and his beleaguered men, watch them go with dread and a strange bit of hope. \nEXT. FRENCH COUNTRY SIDE - NIGHT \nThe FINAL RUMBLES of the DISTANT ARTILLERY fade away.  The night is dark.  The band of six Americans makes their way warily along a French cart path.  Sarge eases up alongside Miller and speaks quietly to him.  The others don't overhear. Sarge How long's your hand been shaking? \nMILLER A couple of weeks.  It started in Portsmouth when they brought us down for loading. \nSARGE Is it getting worse? \nMILLER No.  It comes and goes.  It stops when I look at it. \nSARGE You may have to find yourself a new line of work, this one doesn't seem to agree with you anymore. \nMILLER I'll be alright. \nSarge looks at Miller, closely, evaluating him, they walk on. \nEXT. FRENCH CART PATH - NIGHT (LATER) \nFarther along.  The men are tired but alert.  Jackson is at point.  Miller behind him.  The others at intervals.  Sarge brings up the rear. \nA SOUND.  Jackson stops.  No one speaks, they communicate only with hand signals. \nJACKSON SIGNALS to Miller, ten, twenty, thirty men coming. \nMILLER SIGNALS for the men to get off the path.  They ease into the brush.  An instant later, a PAIR WARY GERMAN INFANTRY MEN appear. \nREIBEN grips his B.A.R. and looks to Miller for permission to open up.  Miller shakes his head and signals, \"let them go.\" A moment later AN ENTIRE PLATOON OF GERMANS rounds the bend.  Fifty men.  Heavily armed.  REIBEN breathes a sigh of relief and lowers hi B.A.R. \nTHE GERMAN PLATOON passes, their boots no more than two feet from the faces of the hidden Americans.  Upham is wide-eyed with fear.  The others are stone-faced. \nTHE GERMANS PASS. \nMILLER MOTIONS for his men to hold their positions. \nUPHAM doesn't see the signal.  He stands, breathing a sigh of relief, just as a GERMAN WHIP-TAIL SQUAD appears, trailing the platoon by thirty meters, protecting their rear. \nUPHAM FREEZES.  He's standing, barely in the shadows, nearly exposed.  Shitting bricks. \nPissed, MILLER prepares to fire.  The Whip-tail squad approaches. \nThen, the GERMANS PASS, miraculously, not seeing Upham in the shadows.  They walk on and disappear.  Upham is weak- kneed, amazed that he's still alive. \nMILLER shoots a devastating glare at him, then signals the rest of the men to follow him into the woods.  Upham scurries after Miller, staying close on his heels. \nEXT. FIELD - NIGHT \nThe little band of Americans walks along the edge of a field, parallel to a cart path.  Wary. \nMiller notices Jackson and Wade drifting too close to each other.  He SNAPS HIS FINGERS, getting their attention, and motions curtly for them to open it up a bit.  They do so. \nEXT. CROSSROADS - NIGHT \nDark.  FAINT DISTANT ARTILLERY.  Miller checks the map as Sarge shines a red flashlight on an array of directional signs.  One of them reads:  \"Ramelle 16 Km.\" Miller puts away the map.  Checks the horizon.  The first glow of dawn is visible. \nMILLER It'll be light, soon.  Let's pick it up. \nEXT. FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE - DAWN \nFirst light.  The SOUND OF DISTANT GUNS has been replaced by the CHIRPING OF BIRDS.  The Americans are taking five. \nMiller stands, a bit apart from the others, looking out at the view.  It's lovely.  Dew shimmers on the long grass. The war is far away. \nUpham walks next to him.  They look out at the view together without speaking for a moment. \nMILLER It looks like a Renoir. \nUPHAM Yes.  Do you know Sibelius' Fourth Symphony, The Normandy? \nMILLER I've been humming it. \nUPHAM I heard. \nMILLER It seemed appropriate. \nUPHAM You know classical music? \nMILLER Some. \nMiller eases back from the edge of the field into the cover of the brush.  He stands and takes off his pack. \nREIBEN Sir, I've got an idea, let's go around. \nMILLER We can't leave it here. \nJACKSON We left them eighty-eights. \nMILLER They don't send planes to put out machine guns. (beat) Two flank runners with surpressing fire.  I'm going right, whoever goes left has to be fast. \nUpham steels himself and steps forward. \nUPHAM Sir, I ran the 220 in high school. \nREIBEN He's fast, Captain, I saw him. \nMiller takes Upham's measure.  Wade laughs with a sneer. \nWADE How fast? \nUPHAM Twenty-four-five. \nWADE Shit, that's nothing, I ran twenty- two flat. \nMILLER Wade goes left. \nWade joins Miller in peeling off his extra gear.  Upham is impressed. \nUPHAM Twenty-two flat? \nWade takes a grenade from Upham's chest strap. \nWADE I would have won the states if some bastard hadn't tripped me in the finals. \nMiller points the others to their firing positions. \nMILLER Sarge, Upham, here.  Jackson, Reiben, ten yards, either side. \nAs they take their positions, Miller and Sarge speak quietly, out of earshot of the men. \nSARGE Rule of thumb, Captain, says you ought to detail this one, instead of going yourself. \nMiller looks at the two dead paratroopers. \nMILLER Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that? \nSARGE How about I go right, sir? \nMILLER How about you take your position? \nSarge hesitates. \nSARGE How about...? \nMILLER (interrupting) How about you shut up and take your position? \nSarge nods. \nSARGE Yes, sir. \nSarge finds a spot.  Miller joins Wade.  Miller waits near Upham as the other men settle into their firing positions. \nUPHAM Good luck, Captain. \nMILLER Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives. \nUPHAM The men said, nine. \nMILLER What do they know? (beat) I had nine, but I feel through the ice when I was seven, my brother pulled me out.  Then I used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in Sicily, it was a dud.  I figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here. \nUPHAM That only leaves three. \nMILLER Plenty. \nMiller sees that the men are in position.  He nods to Wade. \nMILLER Ready? \nWADE Yes, sir. \nMiller and Wade take deep breaths.  Miller Now. \nMILLER AND WADE TAKE OFF AT FULL RUNS. \nREIBEN AND UPHAM repeatedly glance back at Wade. \nSARGE Pulls Wade's hands from the wound. Pours sulfa powder. \nMILLER About to pour his sulfa.  Sees the wound.  Stops.  Knows it's fatal. \nMILLER Damn it! \nThrows the sulfa aside.  Quickly pulls out a morphine pack. \nSARGE Fumbles with a second sulfa bag. \nSARGE Sulfa, more sulfa... \nWADE Frozen in agony.  Looks at Miller. Sees him preparing the morphine shot. They both know. \nWADE Yeah...morphine...make it a double...huh...Captain...? \nMILLER SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck. Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine straight to Wade's brain.  Motions impatiently to Sarge. \nMILLER More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on... \nSARGE Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the morphine. \nMILLER Snatches the morphine from Sarge. Quickly and efficiently prepares a second shot.  He's done this before. \nREIBEN On guard, glancing back.  Pissed off. \nREIBEN Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it... \nUPHAM Freaked out.  Trying to keep his eyes on the perimeter.  Can't. \nJACKSON Watching. \nMILLER Gives Wade the second shot. \nWADE Feels the effects of the first shot. He sees Upham and manages a pained smile. \nWADE LOCKS EYES WITH MILLER.  Looking at him without blame, without forgiveness.  Drifts with the morphine.  Then: WADE DIES \nALL ARE FROZEN IN PLACE \nUPHAM begins to weep. \nREIBEN FURIOUSLY MUTTERS: \nREIBEN Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it... \nMILLER Is silent.  Motionless.  He gently closes Wade's eyes.  His hand quivers slightly as he unclips one of Wades dogtags.  He fumbles and drops it. Sarge notices. \nMiller stares at his hand and steadies it before the men see.  He picks up the dogtag and pockets it. \nThen Miller carefully re-packs the un-used morphine and sulfa, rises and picks up his Thompson. \nUpham shakes his head. \nUPHAM That was no twenty-two flat. \nMiller SLAMS A FRESH CLIP into his Thompson. \nMILLER He lied.  Let's move out. \nMiller turns and walks away without looking back.  The men hesitate, then slowly follow him. \nEXT. FRENCH COUNTRY COW PATH - DAY \nA narrow footpath, arched over by trees, almost a tunnel. The five G.I.'s walk, spread out. \nREIBEN Fuck Private James Ryan, fuck him, just fuck the goddamned son-of-a- bitch. \nJACKSON Shut up, will you? \nREIBEN You shut up, this is the most fucked up mission I ever heard of.  Goddamned Ryan, fuck the little bastard. \nJACKSON Just shut up, Ryan didn't kill Wade. \nREIBEN The hell he didn't. \nMiller motions to them curtly. \nMILLER Keep it down. \nThey shut up.  Miller falls in step to Sarge.  Speaks quietly, the men don't hear. \nMILLER But, that's my personal brand of stupidity, I feel kind of proprietary about it, if you do it again, you're busted. \nSarge allows himself a slight smile. \nSARGE Yes, sir. \nMiller jerks his head for Sarge to follow.  They head back to the men. \nEXT. CLEARING - DAY \nThe men are all in their private worlds, thinking of Wade. No talk.  Miller and Sarge walk back into the clearing. Miller barks at the men. \nMILLER Up.  We're moving out. \nREIBEN I thought you said we had an hour, sir? \nMILLER Well now I'm saying we're moving out.  Get off your ass. \nThe men get up.  Jackson is a bit slow. \nMILLER What the hell's the matter with you, Jackson? \nJACKSON Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade. \nMILLER Who's Wade? \nNo one responds. \nMILLER I said, who the hell is Wade? \nThe men exchange looks.  Jackson speaks for them. \nJACKSON Sir, I understand what you're doin', but I respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner. \nMILLER You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand? \nJACKSON Sir, I understand.  I don't like it, but I understand. \nMILLER Good, now get your goddamned gear. \nThe men pick up their equipment and prepare to move out. Sarge and Miller exchange a silent look.  Miller shakes his head to himself, amazed that the men still allow this shit to work.  He knows they have no choice. \nEXT. FRENCH ROAD - DAY \nMiller and his men walk along the road.  The men are silent, grim. \nEXT. FRENCH PATH - DAY \nMiller checks his map.  figures out where they are.  Folds up the map, points the way and they move out. \nEXT. FRENCH FIELD - DAY \nMore progress.  The men are still grim. \nREIBEN You know what the best possible thing that could happen is? \nJACKSON Yep, you step on a rusty nail, get lockjaw, never say another word as long as you live. \nMiller laughs.  Miller I'll bite, Reiben. \nREIBEN I've given this a lot of thought, sir.  The best thing that could happen is, we find Ryan and he's dead. \nMILLER Why's that? \nREIBEN Well, sir, consider the possibilities. A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take him back to the beach.  Knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive. \nMILLER Except for the last part, that one's not bad. \nREIBEN B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention.  There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another. \nMILLER I don't like that one. \nREIBEN Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him. \nMILLER But we accomplish the mission. \nREIBEN Maybe.  But what if he dies on the way back?  you see what I'm saying, sir?  The best possible situation is, he's dead, we find his body, more or less intact, we grab one of his dog-tags and high-tail it back to the beach, or better yet, we head over to Caen and catch up with division. \nMILLER Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material? \nREIBEN No, sir. \nMILLER That's a mystery to me. \nCrouch-run and take cover as they get within sight of the bridge. \nREIBEN Looks like they've been having a hell of a party, here, Captain. \nMILLER ON THE BRIDGE!  WE'RE COMING IN. \nA YOUNG BUT GRIZZLED VOICE calls back. \nVOICE FROM BRIDGE KISS MY ASS, FRITZ. \nMILLER YOU FIRE AT US AND I'LL DO A HELL OF A LOT MORE THAN THAT. \nVOICE FROM BRIDGE WHO WON THE '38 ARMY-NAVY GAME? \nMiller turns to his men.  They all come up empty. \nMILLER I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA.  HERE WE COME. (to his men) Cover me. \nREIBEN What if our guys open up, sir? \nMILLER You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules. \nREIBEN Have it your way, Captain. \nMiller takes a breath, then DASHES out into the open, toward the bridge. \nTHE GERMAN SNIPERS OPEN UP \nBullets SMASH INTO THE GROUND around Miller. \nMILLER'S MEN POUR FIRE at the German positions, SURPRESSING THE GERMAN FIRE. \nON THE BRIDGE The Paratroopers pour a HEAVY STREAM OF BULLETS at the German positions. \nMiller makes it to the bridge and DIVES over a defensive jumble of crates, sandbags and bodies. \nHe finds himself next to SERGEANT BILL FORREST who was the young but grizzled voice that called out.  With Forrest are some very worn-out, young AMERICAN PARATROOPERS.  Miller catches his breath.  Forrest Navy, sir, twenty-one to nineteen.  They won on a field goal in overtime. \nMILLER I'll keep it in mind. (calls to Sarge) OKAY, SARGE, ONE AT A TIME. \nMiller and the paratroopers FIRE COVER for Miller's men as they come in.  Miller and Forrest alternately take and FIRE. \nForrest Are we glad to see you, sir, we were supposed to hold this bridge for twenty-four hours, it's been six days. \nMILLER Things are tough all over.  We're looking for a Private James Ryan. \nForrest Ryan? \nMILLER Is he here? \nForrest motions to one of the paratroopers. \nForrest Go get Ryan. \n(TO MILLER) What do you want him for, sir? \nMiller doesn't answer.  Jackson leaps over the barricade and scrambles to them. \nMILLER Jackson, get a hold of command. \nJackson cranks up the five-thirty-five.  Miller turns to Forrest. \nMILLER How many men do you have? \nThey pause to FIRE, covering Sarge, the last of Miller's men to leap over the barricade. \nForrest Eleven, sir.  We started with thirty-six.  The bridge was easy to take but the Krauts have been coming back at us ever since.  They must want it intact or we'd be long gone. \nJackson speaks into the radio handset, repeating Miller's hailing I.D.   No response. \nJACKSON Not yet. \nMILLER Keep trying. \nForrest Sir, what do you want with Ryan? \nMiller doesn't answer, he looks past Forrest and sees: \nPRIVATE JAMES RYAN Dashing from cover to cover, making his way toward them.  Ryan is an American classic, nineteen years old, earthy, handsome, sharp, cocky. Though he's exhausted, unshaven, and smeared with dirt and blood, he's very alive.  His eyes shine, his face has a spark.  You can't help but love this kid. \nMILLER'S MEN All watch Ryan run toward them. \nJACKSON So, that's Ryan. \nMiller slowly turns and glares. \nREIBEN (continuing) So, what are a few tanks, sir? \nMiller's more amazed than pissed off.  Reiben smiles. \nREIBEN (continuing) He's right, we can't shoot him...well, we could but we'd get in an enormous amount of trouble.  And he's right about the bridge, it's a hell of a lot more important than he is. \nJACKSON STEPS FORWARD. \nJACKSON Cap'n...? \nMiller turns his glare on Jackson. \nJACKSON (continuing) Seems to me, we got us a opportunity, here, to kill two birds with one stone.  Command seems to think keepin' this boy alive is worth somethin'. If we was to do that and hold this bridge, good chance we'd get us a bucket full of medals.  I might even get me one 'a them big, fancy ones like you got, so's I could sass any officer in the whole dang army, you included. \nMiller does a slow burn. \nUPHAM STEPS FORWARD \nUPHAM I'd like to stay, too, Captain. \nMILLER You don't count. \nSARGE STEPS UP \nSARGE I do and personally, I'd rather get the hell out of here, but somebody's got to stay and take care of you and these pin-head privates of yours. \nMiller looks at FORREST AND THE PARATROOPERS. \nForrest We weren't planning on going anywhere, sir. \nReiben smiles. \nREIBEN See, Captain?  The vote's unanimous. \nMiller's eyes almost pop out of his head.  Miller The vote? What the hell are you talking about?  We don't vote.  This isn't a democracy.  This is the army, I give orders, you follow them.  We don't vote! \nREIBEN Yes, sir, of course, sir, I was merely speaking hypothetically.  IF this was a voting situation, then the vote would have been unanimous.  But of course, it's not a voting situation, you're the captain, and you give the orders, sir. \nMILLER You're goddamned right, I give the order.  Vote!  Jesus Christ!  Listen to me, you little pissant pieces of shit, I am the ranking officer here and what I say goes, is that clear? \nThey all quickly nod. \nJACKSON Yes, sir. \nREIBEN Of course, sir. \nAll the others Yes, sir.  Yes, sir. \nMiller looks from face to face. \nMILLER In that case... (beat) I vote we stay. \nThat's what they wanted to hear.  Miller doesn't give them time to enjoy it, he immediately starts barking orders. \nMILLER Reiben, the B.A.R., there.  Jackson, get up on the bridgekeepers hut with your sniper rifle.  Sarge, you and Upham move that machine gun so it can cover the left flank, it's worthless where it is.  Forrest, I want a full inventory of all your weapons, ammo and ordnance.  Go. \nThey all hurry off, except for Ryan who locks eyes with Miller for a moment. \nRYAN Thank you, sir. \nMILLER (gruffly gentle) Yeah, yeah.  I want you right next to me, no matter where I go, you understand? \nRyan salutes. \nRYAN Yes, sir. \nMILLER Alright, come with me. \nMiller shakes his head at himself and strides off to check the defensive perimeter with Ryan at his side. \nEXT. BRIDGE - DAY \nMiller and Reiben watch as Forrest, Ryan and a couple other paratroopers lay out their weapons and ammo inventory. \nForrest Two machine guns, twenty-two grenades, two Gammon grenades, six satchel charges, twenty-six M-1's, eight Tommy guns and about sixty rounds per man. \nMILLER That's it? \nReiben looks at the sparse array of weaponry. \nREIBEN Sir, can I change my vote? \nUPHAM Goddamn it, sir... \nMILLER That's better, but you've still got a long way to go.  Talk to Reiben, he's a natural and works at it, he'll give you some pointers. \nREIBEN Leave him to me, Captain, I'll have him pissing and moaning with the best of us. \nMILLER See to it. \nRYAN Steps up to Miller. \nRYAN I'd like to go, sir. \nMILLER No, private, I want you to stay here, keep your head down, don't do anything brave or stupid. \nREIBEN Aren't they the same thing, sir? \nMiller smiles. \nMILLER Reiben, I don't know what I'd do without you.  Sarge, keep Ryan close to you and alive. \nSARGE Yes, sir. \nMiller checks Jackson and Forrest. \nMILLER You ready? \nForrest Yes, sir. \nJACKSON You betcha, sir. \nMiller, Forrest and Jackson prepare to move out. \nREIBEN (southern accent) Y'all come back. \nJACKSON Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the way I talk? \nREIBEN (heavy southern accent) Hell, no! \nJackson shoots him a glare, then he follows Miller and Forrest into the darkness.  Sarge, Ryan and the other watch them go. \nEXT. GERMAN EIGHTY-EIGHT EMPLACEMENT - NIGHT \nA German eighty-eight FIRES, sending its big shell into the night.  It's eight-man crew re-loads. \nIN THE DARKNESS A slight movement.  It's Miller.  He crawls to the edge of the emplacement and freezes in the shadows. \nA moment later he's joined by Forrest.  A moment after that, Jackson silently crawls up to them. \nMILLER Eyes the emplacement.  Looks for a weakness.  There is none.  He motions to Forrest and Jackson to wait.  The three of them settle into the darkness. \nEXT. MACHINE GUN NEST - BRIDGE - NIGHT \nSarge, Upham and Reiben sit with Ryan in the darkness.  Ryan is lost in thought, far away.  One after another, Miller's men eye him. \nSARGE Private, I'm sorry about your brothers. \nRyan nods.  Then, with some difficulty, he makes the trip from Iowa back to France.  He turns to Sarge.  Ryan What was the name of the guy who got killed coming up here? \nSARGE Wade. \nRYAN Wade.  Huh, he died coming up here to keep me alive...I never met him...he didn't know me from Adam, strange.  What was he like? \nSARGE A good man, kind of cheerful, Reiben, here, used to call him a happy idiot. \nREIBEN Like hell, I did. \nRYAN My brothers would be mighty pissed off at me, if they knew I let some guy get killed trying to keep me alive. \nSARGE You didn't let anybody get killed, you didn't even know we were coming up here. \nRYAN Sure, I know, but... (sighs) Goddamn it all... \nThe others nod in agreement.  They look closely at Ryan. \nEXT. GERMAN EIGHTY-EIGHT EMPLACEMENT - NIGHT \nDark.  No firing.  Two German soldiers on watch. \nA SHADOW It's Miller.  Easing through the darkness.  Closer to one of the sentries. \nMiller sees Jackson easing up behind another sentry.  Miller nods to Jackson.  They move at the same moment.  Behind the sentries.  SLIT THEIR THROATS. \nBEHIND THE EIGHTY-EIGHT Forrest removes the wheel-blocks. \nThen they proceed with the next.  Upham is covering their tracks while Jackson is digging the holes in which they'll place the rest of the mines. \nEXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT \nQuiet.  Dark.  Everything is ready.  There's nothing to do now but wait. \nON THE BRIDGEKEEPERS HUT \nReiben and Jackson sit behind the sandbags.  They can see Ryan sitting in the moonlight about twenty yards away, manning the rear machine gun nest with Sarge. \nREIBEN What do you think? \nJACKSON I think I'm we got that eighty-eight. \nREIBEN I mean, Ryan, what do you think of him? \nJackson shrugs. \nJACKSON He ain't half-bad, I guess. \nREIBEN I guess. \nThey're quiet for a moment. \nJACKSON He ain't Wade. \nREIBEN Nope, he ain't Wade. \nTheir eyes keep coming back to Ryan. \nMILLER Crouch-runs through the shadows and stops at the bridgekeepers hut. \nMILLER Reiben... \nMiller points, directing Reiben to the forward machine gun nest. \nREIBEN Yes, sir. \nREIBEN jumps down and moves forward. \nMILLER runs across the bridge and joins Sarge and Ryan in the rear machine gun nest. \nMILLER You set?  Sarge nods. \nRYAN Yes, sir. \nMiller and Sarge exchange a look.  Then Miller slips off to check the others. \nEXT. BRIDGE - DAWN \nFirst light.  The Americans are ready for battle.  WE SEE them in their positions: \nREIBEN AND UPHAM Manning the forward machine gun nest. \nJACKSON Behind the sandbags, on top of the bridgekeeper's hut. \nFORREST AND THE PARATROOPERS \nBehind the second of two barricades set up between the forward and the rear machine gun nests. \nRYAN AND SARGE Manning rear machine gun. \nMILLER At the bridgehead, waiting. \nSOUND FROM DOWN THE ROAD \nAll eyes turn. \nSINGLE GERMAN SOLDIER \nDashes across the street.  Exposed only for an instant. Then another.  And another. \nMILLER Cocks his Thompson.  Settles down behind some sandbags. \nMILLER HERE THEY COME! \nA RUSH OF GERMANS ADVANCE, BLASTING AT THE BRIDGE. \nTHE AMERICANS RETURN FIRE \nREIBEN OPENS UP with the MACHINE GUN. \nTHE GERMANS At least fifty of them, advancing on the bridge.  Running from cover to cover.  A squad pushing a French truck, using it as a shield. \nTHE GERMANS Open up with a volley. \nSARGE Is almost there. \nALL THE AMERICANS STAND AND FIRE \nAs best they can.  Right past Sarge.  It's not enough. \nSARGE Five feet from the sandbags, his back is TORN APART by Germans fire. He looks down, stunned at his chest. Amazed to see GAPING HOLES.  An instant of surprise, more than fear. \nHe looks to Miller.  Takes two more stumbling steps.  Falls onto the sandbags.  Dropping the B.A.R. over the edge.  Dies. THE AMERICANS FIRE MADLY, CONTINUOUSLY \nTHE GERMANS Who killed Sarge are killed.  The others back off for now. \nREIBEN, UPHAM, JACKSON, RYAN fire at the retreating Germans. \nMILLER Grabs Sarge and pulls him over the barricade.  Sees that he's dead. \nTHE GERMANS RETREAT. \nAround the corner. \nMILLER Stunned, lays Sarge down, kneeling next to him. \nTHE OTHERS Watch, start to gather. \nREIBEN Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it... \nMILLER Get back to your positions! \nThey hesitate. \nMILLER Go! \nThey follow the order.  All except Ryan, who doesn't move. He can't take his eyes off Sarge. \nMILLER Doesn't move.  He just stares at Sarge's body. \nRYAN Looks at Miller, sees him growing weak, starting to sway.  He gently tries to move Miller aside. \nRYAN I'll take care of Sarge... \nMiller looks up at Ryan, then back at Sarge's body.  Miller grows cold, making the same startling transformation he made as he kneeled over Wade's body. \nMILLER Sarge?  Who's Sarge? \nBut this time it doesn't work.  He can't make it stick.  The hard expression, disappears.  He drifts, utterly lost.  He's called his own bluff. \nEXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT \nDark.  Quiet.  The distant guns are silent for once. \nWaiting.  Reiben, Upham, Jackson, Ryan and Miller have tightened their perimeter. \nMiller is in a trance.  The others glance at him nervously. \nThey eat in silence.  K-rations.  Some bread.  A last supper. \nThen, from out of nowhere, Miller speaks: \nMILLER English teacher, Addley, Pennsylvania. \nSlowly, Miller's men turn to him. \nUPHAM What'd you say, Captain? \nMILLER I teach English at Addley High School in Addley, Pennsylvania. \nREIBEN Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it. \nJACKSON Like hell, you did. \nUPHAM Captain, what about our deal? \nMILLER I changed my mind. \nREIBEN What deal? \nMILLER I coach the baseball team, too. \nJACKSON No kiddin'? \nREIBEN What deal? \nREIBEN Sees Ryan.  Races over.  SHOOTS one German.  STABS the other. \nRYAN FALLS BACK.  Stunned, unhurt. \nREIBEN only gives him a quick look.  Gets to the MACHINE GUN. \nOPENS UP against the Germans who are still coming.  FIRES A LONG BURST.  Germans drop. \nMILLER FIRES again.  More Germans drop. \nTHE GERMANS Take positions in the building near the bridge. \nThey start working their way to the tops of the nearby buildings. \nMaking their way along the riverbanks. \nREIBEN AND RYAN Forward.  Reiben FIRING.  Ryan feeding the ammo belt. \nREIBEN MORE AMMO! \nUPHAM Hears that.  Doesn't hesitate.  He grabs a pair of ammo boxes.  RUNS toward Reiben and Ryan. \nSEVERAL GERMANS ZERO UPHAM \nOPEN UP on him. \nBULLETS TRAIL UPHAM.  He's outrunning them.  Almost there. \nUPHAM TAKES HALF-A-DOZEN SLUGS.  Torn apart. Stumbles the final few steps to the machine gun nest.  Falls on the sandbags, giving Reiben and Ryan the ammo.  UPHAM'S DEAD. \nRYAN STUNNED. \nFor just a micro-second.  No time.  Grabs the ammo.  REIBEN FIRING.  Ryan clips the new ammo belt onto the tail of the one almost out. \nREIBEN Continues FIRING.  CUTTING DOWN the advancing Germans. \nTHE GERMANS START TO FALL BACK \nMILLER Knows what that means.  He hears the RUMBLE OF THE TANKS. \nMILLER TIGHTEN IT UP!  HERE THEY COME! \nRYAN AND REIBEN Immediately grab the machine gun and ammo and race back to the rear nest. \nThen RYAN AND MILLER converge at the eighty-eight.  THE FIRST TANK APPEARS Huge.  Terrifying.  Clanking.  Trailed by two German infantry platoons. \nJACKSON On the bridgekeeper's hut.  Picking off German soldiers who follow the tank. \nA GERMAN INFANTRYMAN SPOTS JACKSON.  Hollers into the tanks voice-tube. \nTHE TANK Stops.  Grinds its gears.  Turning it's turret towards the bridgekeepers hut. \nMILLER JACKSON! \nJACKSON Knows what's coming but he holds his position, continuing to pick off German soldiers. \nTHE TANK BLASTS THE BRIDGEKEEPER'S HUT AND JACKSON ARE OBLITERATED IN THE EXPLOSION. \nMILLER AND RYAN SEE JACKSON DIE.  A bare moment to react.  Then, they turn their attention back to the eighty-eight. Frantically turning the aiming cranks. Lowering the barrel to point blank. \nTANK AGAINST EIGHTY-EIGHT. \nWhich can fire first. \nMILLER AND RYAN Win the race. \nFIRE THE EIGHTY-EIGHT BLAST THE LEAD TANK DESTROY IT IN A SHOWER OF METAL AND FLAMES \nMILLER AND RYAN Quickly reload the eighty-eight. FIRE AGAIN. \nDESTROY THE SECOND TANK. \nMILLER Shoves the FINAL SHELL into the breech of the eighty-eight.  Pats Ryan on the back.  Grabs a SATCHEL CHARGE. \nRUNS down the bridge.  Right toward the two advancing tanks. \nRYAN FIRES THE EIGHTY-EIGHT. \nDESTROYING THE THIRD TANK. \nMILLER Races through the debris.  Trailed by BULLETS. \nREIBEN With the machine gun.  Covers Miller. Keeping most of the German infantry down. \n", "test1_input": "JACKSON, NAILS a pair of Germans.  MILLER CUTS DOWN two more. SARGE gets one.  Not enough. \nTHE SECOND SIX Are RAKED BY MACHINE GUNS.  All are KILLED. \nMILLER Turns, looking for the next six. His eyes fall on Sarge and REIBEN who is a cynical, sharp, New Yorker. Reiben smiles. \nREIBEN (heavy Brooklyn accent) Captain, can I put in for a transfer? \nMILLER Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start the paperwork. \nTHE THIRD SIX Moves into place.  Sarge and Miller exchange a look.  They both see the madness of what they're doing. \nMILLER AND THE OTHERS \nOPEN UP on the Germans. \nMILLER GO! \nSARGE Rolls his eyes, takes a breath. Scrambles into the gap.  The other five right behind. \nIN THE GAP BULLETS EVERYWHERE. \nThree are HIT.  Then another.  POTATO MASHER GRENADES bounce down.  EXPLODE below. \nTHE GERMAN MACHINE GUN swings toward Sarge and Reiben.  Miller sees them about to get it...  MILLER STEPS OUT INTO THE OPEN. \nA perfect target.  Captain's bars glinting.  FIRING.  TRYING TO DRAW THE GERMAN FIRE. \nTHE GERMAN MACHINE GUNNER \nSEES MILLER STANDING IN THE OPEN.  Too much to pass up.  He swings the machine gun away from Sarge and Reiben, toward Miller. \nA ROW OF GERMAN BULLETS approaches Miller...he's an instant from death. \nSARGE AND REIBEN DIVE \nUnder the overhang to safety. \nMILLER DIVES BACK TO COVER, BARELY MAKES IT, HIS BOOT HEAL IS BLOWN OFF. \nUNDER THE OVERHANG Sarge and Reiben untangle themselves. \nREIBEN I'll be Goddamned!  I'm not dead! \nSarge hollers back to Miller. \nSARGE CAPTAIN, IF YOUR MOTHER SAW YOU DO THAT, SHE'D BE VERY UPSET! \nMILLER I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY MOTHER. \nQuick smiles.  MILLER AND HIS RANGERS lean out and FIRE. HIT more Germans. \nSARGE AND REIBEN run up the path, under the overhang.  Stop near the top.  Pull pins on grenades.  Count.  Both throw long, arcing over the crest, perfectly aimed. \nTHE TWO GRENADES EXPLODE. \nPutt out the two worst machine gun nests. \nMILLER Crosses the gap.  His men follow. \nAT THE CREST The Americans swarm over the top. FIRING. \nTWO DOZEN GERMANS FIRE BACK as they retreat. \nAbandoning the perimeter defense of the bunkers.  The Germans are CUT DOWN. \nMILLER motions to WADE, a small, wide-eyed, demolition man who's struggling under the weight of half-a dozen satchel charges. \nMILLER Okay, Wade, your turn. \nWade Captain, I love it when you say that. \nMiller, Sarge, Reiben and Jackson cover Wade as he races to the first of three bunkers.  Dodging bullets from inside. Wade tosses a SATCHEL CHARGE into a gun port.  A HUGE, MUFFLED EXPLOSION, rocks the bunker. \nMILLER AND SARGE Survey the field. \nSARGE What the hell were you doing?  Drawing fire! \nMILLER Worked, didn't it? \nSARGE You tryin' to get yourself killed? \nMILLER Don't need to, the Krauts go that covered. \n", "test1_true": "Miller coldly glances at the dead and wounded.  Then he moves on, leading his surviving men toward the two remaining German bunkers.  The SOUNDS OF BIG GUNS and MACHINE GUNS FIRE surround him.  DISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. WAR DEPARTMENT BUILDING - DAY \nThe SOUND OF CLATTERING MACHINE GUN FIRE SEGUES TO that of CLATTERING TYPEWRITERS.  A huge government building stands in the heart of Washington, D.C. \nSUPERIMPOSITION: WAR DEPARTMENT WASHINGTON, D.C. \nJUNE 8, 1944 \nINT. COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - WAR DEPT. - DAY \nVery busy.  A dozen, somber military clerks work behind desks, quickly and efficiently.  No small talk. \nA CLERK Older than the others, sad-eyed, adds a sheet of paper to a large pile in his out-box. \nCLOSE SHOT An outgoing telegram.  It reads: \"We regret to inform you...killed in action...heroic service...\"  This is the paperwork of death. \nTHE CLERK Pulls out a file.  Reads.  Finds something troubling.  Quickly shuffles through some other papers.  Finds what he's looking for.  Rises from his desk and hurries out of the office. \nINT. LIEUTENANT'S OFFICE - WAR DEPT. - DAY \nSeen through the glass wall.  The clerk speaks to a YOUNG LIEUTENANT who is visibly shaken by what he is being told. He motions to the clerk to follow and he strides out of the office with the clerk on his heels. \nINT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - WAR DEPT. - DAY \nAgain, seen through a glass wall.  The Young Lieutenant speaks to a YOUNG CAPTAIN who, like the Lieutenant is clearly bothered by what he's being told.  The Captain takes the papers from the Young Lieutenant and strides out. \nINT. COLONEL'S OFFICE - WAR DEPT. - DAY \nA busy office.  Aides and secretaries scurry about.  The walls and tables are covered with maps of Normandy and complex deployment charts.  A ONE-ARMED COLONEL with a chest full of ribbons pours himself another cup of coffee.  He clearly hasn't slept in a long time.  The Young Captain, his staff officer, walks in. \nYoung captain Colonel, I've got something you should know about. \nOne-armed colonel Yes? \nYoung captain Two brothers died in Normandy.  One at Omaha Beach, the other at Utah.  Last week in Guam a third brother was killed in action.  All three telegrams went out this morning.  Their mother in Iowa is getting all three telegrams this afternoon. \nThe life drains from the Colonel.  Others in the room hear and freeze. \nOne-armed colonel Oh, Jesus. \nYoung captain There's more.  There's a fourth brother.  The youngest.  He parachuted in with the Hundred-and-First Airborne the night before the invasion.  He's on the front. \nOne-armed colonel Is he alive? \nYoung captain We don't know. \nThe Colonel regains his bearings.  Stands and motions curtly to the Captain.  One-armed colonel Come with me. \nThe Colonel regains his bearings.  Stands and motions curtly to the Captain. \nOne-armed colonel Come with me. \nThe Colonel strides from the room with the Captain on his heels.  The aides and secretaries watch them go. \nEXT. FARM ROAD - IOWA - DAY \nA black car drives along a dirt road, a cloud of dust rising behind.  Passing through an endless expanse of ripening corn. \nEXT. RYAN FARM - IOWA - DAY \nA whit farmhouse.  A barn.  A stand of trees.  Cornfields as far as the eye can see. \nIN THE YARD A tire swing.  A bushel basket nailed to the barn over a dirt basketball court. \nA PORCH SWING Sits empty.  Moves slightly. \nON THE GLASS OF THE FRONT DOOR \nFour American flag decals.  Each one, a man in service. \nMARGARET RYAN Steps out.  Around sixty.  Her face shows the lines of a life of hard work and mother hood.  A good woman. \nShe wipes her hands on her apron and looks out across the fields.  Far in the distance she sees the dust rising behind the black car. \nShe watches the car get closer, then sees it turn toward her house.  She starts to grow uneasy. \nAs the black car approaches, her breath comes hard.  She reaches out and steadies herself on the porch post. \nThe car pulls up to the house.  She sees three men get out, one wearing a clerical collar.  The first of her tears come. \n", "test1_id": 2670, "test2_input": "COLONEL ANDERSON Spit it out, Captain. \nMILLER HESITATES, THEN: \nMILLER Respectfully, sir, sending men all the way up to Ramelle to save one private doesn't make a fucking, goddamned bit of sense. (beat) Sir. \nThe other officers freeze, listening without turning.  Colonel Anderson glares at Miller. \nCOLONEL ANDERSON You think just because you hold the Congressional Medal of Honor, you can say any damn thing you please to your superior officers? \nMiller considers the question, then smiles. \nMILLER Yes, sir, more or less. \nColonel Anderson looks as if he's about to bit Miller's head off, then he smiles, too. \nCOLONEL ANDERSON Alright, I'll give you that. Continue. \nMILLER The numbers don't make sense, sir. His brothers are dead, that's too bad, but they're out of the equation. Sending men up there is bleeding heart crapola from three thousand miles away.  One private is simply not worth a squad.  Colonel anderson This one is.  He's worth a lot more than that.  Which is why I'm sending you, you're the best field officer there is. \nMiller Shrugs. \nMILLER Yes and no, sir, what about Morgan? Fine officer, regular church goer, writes poetry, he might like a mission like this. (beat) And he's taller than me. \nColonel Anderson listens with amused tolerance, but it's time to get back to business. \nCOLONEL ANDERSON That's enough, Captain, you have your orders.  Major Thomas will fill you in. \nMiller knows when to back off.  He salutes. \nMILLER Yes, sir. \nMiller and Colonel Anderson exchange a private look. \nCOLONEL ANDERSON Good luck, John. \nMILLER Thank you, sir. \nMiller joins Major Thomas at one of the smaller map tables. Colonel Anderson watches Miller for an instant, then notices the other officers in the tent watching.  A glare and they go back to work. \nEXT. BATTLESHIP - DAY \nA MASSIVE BARRAGE of fifteen-inch shells BLASTS from the deck of the enormous ship. \nEXT. CRATER FIELD - CRANBERRY BOG - DAY \nHUGE EXPLOSIONS.  The big naval shells SLAM into the German position on the far side of the cranberry bog crater field. \nIN THE CRATERS Miller's Ranger company ducks and covers.  The BARRAGE SUBSIDES.  The Rangers rise, FIRING, leap-frogging from crater to crater, advancing against the remaining Germans who return SMALL ARMS FIRE. \nMILLER Crouch-runs and dives into a crater with Sarge. \nMILLER Put on your traveling shoes, Sarge, we're heading out. \nSARGE Caen? \nMILLER I wish.  You and I are taking a squad up to Ramelle on a public relations mission. \nSARGE You?  Leading a squad? \nMILLER Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home. \nSARGE What about the company? \nMILLER Simpson. \nSARGE Simpson?  Jesus Christ on a fucking pogo stick! \nMILLER I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson with his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition. \nSARGE Beasley's dead. \nMILLER Okay, Wade.  Translators? \nSARGE Fresh out. \nMILLER What about Talbot? \nSARGE Twenty minutes ago.  Miller Damn, I'll go see if I can find another one.  You get Reiben, Jackson and Wade, meet me at transport. \nSARGE Yes, sir. \nThey wait for a lull in the firing, then scramble out of the crater and crouch-run in opposite directions. \n", "test2_true": "Just in from the beaches.  DISTANT ARTILLERY AND EXPLOSIONS. Nothing close.  Dust.  Confusion.  Vehicles of every sort moving out.  Tanks, half-tracks, troop trucks.  In the middle of the mess, a cigar-chewing SUPPLY SERGEANT works at a make- shift desk made out of crate.  He yells at a PRIVATE. \nSUPPLY SERGEANT GET THOSE GODDAMNED HALF-TRACKS OUT OF THERE! \nPrivate They're blocked in! \nSERGEANT THEN UNBLOCK 'EM! \nSARGE< REIBEN, JACKSON AND WADE \nWait nearby.  Reiben is beside himself, pacing, muttering. The others are relaxed. \nMILLER Strides through the chaos, avoiding the passing vehicles.  He sees his men and walks toward them.  Reiben hurries up to Miller, pleading. \nREIBEN Please, sir, you can't take me to Ramelle, I gotta go to Caen, sir, please, I told you, they make Caen lingerie there, it's beautiful, it's the best there is, it's...oh, please, sir... \nMILLER Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're the best. \nREIBEN (desperate) No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest.  Or what about Faulkner?  Or that little guy with the glasses? \nMILLER Trust me, you're the best. \nREIBEN (whimpering) But, sir... \nMiller jerks his head for his men to follow and he strides off toward the Supply Sergeant's table.  Sarge falls in next to Miller. \nSARGE You get a translator, Captain? \nMILLER I've got a line on one. \nTRANSPORT OPERATIONS TABLE Chaos.  Vehicles THUNDERING by.  The Supply Sergeant juggles runners and paperwork.  Miller steps up to him. \nMILLER Sergeant, I need a truck. \nSUPPLY SERGEANT Sorry, sir, fresh out of trucks, how 'bout a '38 Ford Roadster, hard-top, red with black interior. \nMILLER White-walls? \nSUPPLY SERGEANT No white-walls, sir, there's a war on. (to the Private) NOT THERE, YOU GODDAMNED IDIOT, OVER THERE! (to Miller) I can't help you, sir. \nMILLER A half-track, anything. \nSUPPLY SERGEANT Sorry, sir.  Division is using everything on wheels to get up to Caen. (notices Miller's shoulder patch) How come you guys aren't going? \nMiller ignores the question.  He spies a jeep. \nMILLER How about that jeep? \nSUPPLY SERGEANT That's General Gavin's.  His lap dog told me if anyone breathes on it, I'll get busted and if anyone so much as touches it with their little finger, I'll get court marshaled. If you were to take it, they'd shoot me. \nJACKSON Cap'n, does that mean we got to walk all the way up to Ramelle? \nSUPPLY SERGEANT What's at Ramelle beside a lot of Germans. \nMILLER A paratrooper named Ryan.  He's going home, if he's alive. \nSUPPLY SERGEANT Senator's son? \nMILLER No, three brothers of his were killed in action.  Command wants him out of there. \nThe Supply Sergeant grunts as if punched in the belly. \nSUPPLY SERGEANT Damn...I got a couple brothers... \nMiller looks at him, noting his reaction coldly.  The Supply Sergeant shifts his eyes toward General Gavin's jeep. \nEXT. ROAD LEADING FROM TRANSPORT - DAY \nMiller and his men drive off, fast, in General Gavin's jeep. Sarge is at the wheel, weaving and bouncing through the bedlam of men and vehicles.  Miller rides shotgun.  Reiben, Jackson and Wade are crammed in the back. \nThe SUPPLY SERGEANT Watches them go.  Behind him, GENERAL GAVIN, pure piss and vinegar, strides up, trailed by his huge staff.  He looks around for his jeep, comes up empty. \nGENERAL GAVIN SERGEANT, WHERE THE HELL IS MY GODDAMNED JEEP!? \nThe Supply Sergeant puffs his cigar with a smile and turns to take his lumps. \nEXT. ROAD - DAY \nMiller and his men weave through the chaos of the American staging area. \nMILLER We've got to make one stop. \n", "test2_id": 2671, "test3_input": "THEY MAKE IT TO THE TREES \nKeep running.  Through the bushes and brambles.  Thirty yards in. \nTHE EXPLOSIONS STOP THE MEN ALL STOP Panting.  Struggling to catch their breath. Check their body parts.  Everything's there. They have their weapons, most of their gear. \nReiben looks back through the trees at THE JEEP, which is nothing more than a burning carcass.  He shakes his head. \nREIBEN General Gavin is going to be very irritated at you, Captain. \nMILLER Stands on the edge of the woods, almost in a trance. \nUPHAM Captain, I... \nSARGE Sssssh! \nMiller, far away, quickly shifts his eyes and ears from position to position. \nMILLER Sarge, maps. \nSarge quickly opens up the map case.  The men are dead silent, frozen in place. \nMILLER Two eighty-eights, just under two- and-a-half miles, that way, vector from the jeep, through those two trees at the base of the hill.  The mortars came from behind that rise, there, four of them. \nSarge quickly starts vectoring on the map.  Miller snaps out of it. \nMILLER Wade, the radio. \nWade instantly starts cranking it up.  Upham is amazed. \nUPHAM You can tell all that, just by the sound, sire? \nMILLER That's not all.  There were nine gunners on the eighty-eights, one had a broken heel on his boot, two had bratwurst for supper last night, one of them is named Fritz, the other, Hans, maybe, I don't know, it's hard to tell. \nJACKSON Corporal, you have just seen one of Captain Miller's many God-given talents.  If, by some miracle, you survive, you will witness many more of them. \nSarge finished vectoring. \nSARGE Got it, sir.  We gonna go take care of those eighty-eights? \nMILLER That's not what we're here for. \nWADE (re. radio) I've got command, Captain. \nMiller takes the handset from Wade and the map from Sarge. \nMILLER (into radio) This is Baker Charley One, fire mark, sector three, foxtrot quadrant, four- three by baker-three.  Two eighty- eights.  Tell our boys to come in low from the east in case the Krauts have ack-ack.  Good hunting.  Over. \nA VOICE ON THE RADIO SIGNS OFF through the static.  Wade packs up the radio.  Miller folds up the map.  Jackson Sir, wouldn't take us but a minute to put out them eighty-eights. \nSARGE He's right, Captain, it might be kind of dangerous for those flyboys. \nMILLER Tell that to Private James Ryan. We've got our orders.  Let's go. \nMiller heads off without pausing or looking back.  The rest of the men don't like it, but they follow.  Upham trails, amazed at Miller. \nEXT. WOODS - DAY \nMiller walks point.  His men follow warily.  Upham falls in alongside Reiben. \nUPHAM So, where are you from? \nREIBEN Get lost. \nUpham smiles lamely and moves on to Jackson. \nUPHAM So, where are you from? \nJACKSON You writin' a book or somethin'? \nUPHAM As a matter of fact, I am. \nJACKSON Figured. \nWade overhears and smiles at Upham. \nWADE I'm Wade, that's spelled, W-A-D-E, I'm small but wiry, with piercing, steel-gray eyes, and a rough-hewn but handsome face, I'm from Colorado, my father's a mining engineer, don't you take notes? \nUpham shakes his head. \nUPHAM Demolition, right? \nWADE Since I was nine years old.  They got a lot of explosives around mines. Me and my little brother could get into any warehouse you ever saw. Damn, we had fun! \n", "test3_true": "JACKSON I'm Jackson.  I'm from West Fork, Tennessee.  My pappy's a preacher. Him and his two brothers got a ministry, The Blessed Church of the Wandering Gospel. \nUPHAM In West Fork? \nJACKSON In the back of a nineteen and thirty- one stretch Hudson with a big ole' trailer. \nUPHAM No kidding. \nJACKSON I don't make jokes about things of, or related to, the preaching of the Holy Gospel, including the ministerial calling of my family. \nUPHAM So they travel around from place to place and preach? \nJACKSON We got us a tent, forty-two feet across, eighteen feet at center, hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs. Circuit's eleven towns, covers all 'a Hasset County and most 'a Weller County.  I expect that upon completion of my military service I will be joinin' said ministry. \nUPHAM What about the Captain?  Where's he from? \nThey all shake their heads.  Miller's out of earshot. \nJACKSON You figure that out, you got yourself one nice prize. \nSARGE Over three hundred bucks, last I heard.  Wade Company's got a pool, five bucks gets you in, whoever guesses where the Captain's from and what he did as a civilian gets it all. \nJACKSON The whole kit and caboodle. \nUPHAM But everybody's heard of him, he won the Congressional Medal of Honor, he saved a dozen men. \nREIBEN We know. \nUPHAM Somebody must know where he's from, what he did for a living. \nSARGE Somebody probably does. \nUPHAM Why don't you just ask him? \nJACKSON The Captain prefers not to discuss certain aspects of his life, in particular, everything up to and including his enlistment in the United States Army. \nSARGE I've been with him since Anzio.  I'm closer to him that I am to my own brother but I don't even know what state he's from.  Somewhere in the Northeast as near as I can figure. I don't even have a clue what he did for a living as civilian. \nReiben shakes his head. \nREIBEN No one's gonna win the money for the simple reason that the Captain never was a civilian.  They assembled him at O.C.S. out of spare body parts from dead G.I.'s.  I know this for a fact. \nJACKSON (defensively) You got somethin' against the Cap'n? \nREIBEN Hell, no.  I think he's the best officer in the whole goddamned army, bar none. \nThey all nod in assent, no argument there. \nJACKSON You got that right. \nMiller walks on ahead, unaware of their conversation.  Upham watches Miller, with even more curiosity. \nEXT. HEDGEROW FIELD - DAY \nMiller and his men walk along a hedgerow that parallels a country cow path.  They're staying close to the cover of the brush.  Miller walks tall now. \nJACKSON Captain, my feet are most uncomfortable.  If I'd 'a known we was gonna have to walk all the way to Ramelle, I never would 'a volunteered for this here mission. \nMILLER You didn't volunteer, Jackson. \nJACKSON I most likely would have, sir, had I been given the opportunity. \nREIBEN If we find Ryan and he's still alive, that son-of-a-bitch is gonna carry this goddamned B.A.R. back to the beach for me. \nJACKSON Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft.  Back home, we go out squirrel huntin', I walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister. \nREIBEN You know what a B.A.R. weighs? Nineteen and a half pounds, not counting ammo. (re. ammo bandoleers) And you think these things are comfortable?  They may look good but they weigh twelve pounds each, that's thirty-six pounds, right there. \nWADE So what?  I've got three satchel charges, six gammon grenades, a dozen- and-a-half pineapples, and all my regular gear.  You don't hear me complaining. \nREIBEN That's because, as I have pointed out on numerous occasions, you are a happy idiot. \nWADE No, I just happen to take the Captain's advice and look at the bright side of things. \nUPHAM How do you do it? \nWADE It's easy, it runs in my family, take my grandfather, for example... \nREIBEN Oh, Christ, now we gotta listen to that grandfather thing again. \nWADE As I was saying, before I was so rudely interrupted, my grandfather got old, as grandfathers tend to do. He needed someone to take care of him.  We move around all the time, going from one mine to another, so we had to put him in a home.  Nice enough place but kind of depressing. But not for Granddad.  He just convinced himself he was on a cruise ship, going to Tahiti, he had his own cabin, first class, with room service.  It just so happened that the weather was always lousy, so he never bothered to go up on deck. Happiest guy you ever saw until the day he died. \n", "test3_id": 2672}

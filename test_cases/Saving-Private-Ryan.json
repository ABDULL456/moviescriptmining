{"test1_input": "THEY MAKE IT TO THE TREES \nKeep running.  Through the bushes and brambles.  Thirty yards in. \nTHE EXPLOSIONS STOP THE MEN ALL STOP Panting.  Struggling to catch their breath. Check their body parts.  Everything's there. They have their weapons, most of their gear. \nReiben looks back through the trees at THE JEEP, which is nothing more than a burning carcass.  He shakes his head. \nREIBEN General Gavin is going to be very irritated at you, Captain. \nMILLER Stands on the edge of the woods, almost in a trance. \nUPHAM Captain, I... \nSARGE Sssssh! \nMiller, far away, quickly shifts his eyes and ears from position to position. \nMILLER Sarge, maps. \nSarge quickly opens up the map case.  The men are dead silent, frozen in place. \nMILLER Two eighty-eights, just under two- and-a-half miles, that way, vector from the jeep, through those two trees at the base of the hill.  The mortars came from behind that rise, there, four of them. \nSarge quickly starts vectoring on the map.  Miller snaps out of it. \nMILLER Wade, the radio. \nWade instantly starts cranking it up.  Upham is amazed. \nUPHAM You can tell all that, just by the sound, sire? \nMILLER That's not all.  There were nine gunners on the eighty-eights, one had a broken heel on his boot, two had bratwurst for supper last night, one of them is named Fritz, the other, Hans, maybe, I don't know, it's hard to tell. \nJACKSON Corporal, you have just seen one of Captain Miller's many God-given talents.  If, by some miracle, you survive, you will witness many more of them. \nSarge finished vectoring. \nSARGE Got it, sir.  We gonna go take care of those eighty-eights? \nMILLER That's not what we're here for. \nWADE (re. radio) I've got command, Captain. \nMiller takes the handset from Wade and the map from Sarge. \nMILLER (into radio) This is Baker Charley One, fire mark, sector three, foxtrot quadrant, four- three by baker-three.  Two eighty- eights.  Tell our boys to come in low from the east in case the Krauts have ack-ack.  Good hunting.  Over. \nA VOICE ON THE RADIO SIGNS OFF through the static.  Wade packs up the radio.  Miller folds up the map.  Jackson Sir, wouldn't take us but a minute to put out them eighty-eights. \nSARGE He's right, Captain, it might be kind of dangerous for those flyboys. \nMILLER Tell that to Private James Ryan. We've got our orders.  Let's go. \nMiller heads off without pausing or looking back.  The rest of the men don't like it, but they follow.  Upham trails, amazed at Miller. \nEXT. WOODS - DAY \nMiller walks point.  His men follow warily.  Upham falls in alongside Reiben. \nUPHAM So, where are you from? \nREIBEN Get lost. \nUpham smiles lamely and moves on to Jackson. \nUPHAM So, where are you from? \nJACKSON You writin' a book or somethin'? \nUPHAM As a matter of fact, I am. \nJACKSON Figured. \nWade overhears and smiles at Upham. \nWADE I'm Wade, that's spelled, W-A-D-E, I'm small but wiry, with piercing, steel-gray eyes, and a rough-hewn but handsome face, I'm from Colorado, my father's a mining engineer, don't you take notes? \nUpham shakes his head. \nUPHAM Demolition, right? \nWADE Since I was nine years old.  They got a lot of explosives around mines. Me and my little brother could get into any warehouse you ever saw. Damn, we had fun! \n", "test1_true": "JACKSON I'm Jackson.  I'm from West Fork, Tennessee.  My pappy's a preacher. Him and his two brothers got a ministry, The Blessed Church of the Wandering Gospel. \nUPHAM In West Fork? \nJACKSON In the back of a nineteen and thirty- one stretch Hudson with a big ole' trailer. \nUPHAM No kidding. \nJACKSON I don't make jokes about things of, or related to, the preaching of the Holy Gospel, including the ministerial calling of my family. \nUPHAM So they travel around from place to place and preach? \nJACKSON We got us a tent, forty-two feet across, eighteen feet at center, hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs. Circuit's eleven towns, covers all 'a Hasset County and most 'a Weller County.  I expect that upon completion of my military service I will be joinin' said ministry. \nUPHAM What about the Captain?  Where's he from? \nThey all shake their heads.  Miller's out of earshot. \nJACKSON You figure that out, you got yourself one nice prize. \nSARGE Over three hundred bucks, last I heard.  Wade Company's got a pool, five bucks gets you in, whoever guesses where the Captain's from and what he did as a civilian gets it all. \nJACKSON The whole kit and caboodle. \nUPHAM But everybody's heard of him, he won the Congressional Medal of Honor, he saved a dozen men. \nREIBEN We know. \nUPHAM Somebody must know where he's from, what he did for a living. \nSARGE Somebody probably does. \nUPHAM Why don't you just ask him? \nJACKSON The Captain prefers not to discuss certain aspects of his life, in particular, everything up to and including his enlistment in the United States Army. \nSARGE I've been with him since Anzio.  I'm closer to him that I am to my own brother but I don't even know what state he's from.  Somewhere in the Northeast as near as I can figure. I don't even have a clue what he did for a living as civilian. \nReiben shakes his head. \nREIBEN No one's gonna win the money for the simple reason that the Captain never was a civilian.  They assembled him at O.C.S. out of spare body parts from dead G.I.'s.  I know this for a fact. \nJACKSON (defensively) You got somethin' against the Cap'n? \nREIBEN Hell, no.  I think he's the best officer in the whole goddamned army, bar none. \nThey all nod in assent, no argument there. \nJACKSON You got that right. \nMiller walks on ahead, unaware of their conversation.  Upham watches Miller, with even more curiosity. \nEXT. HEDGEROW FIELD - DAY \nMiller and his men walk along a hedgerow that parallels a country cow path.  They're staying close to the cover of the brush.  Miller walks tall now. \nJACKSON Captain, my feet are most uncomfortable.  If I'd 'a known we was gonna have to walk all the way to Ramelle, I never would 'a volunteered for this here mission. \nMILLER You didn't volunteer, Jackson. \nJACKSON I most likely would have, sir, had I been given the opportunity. \nREIBEN If we find Ryan and he's still alive, that son-of-a-bitch is gonna carry this goddamned B.A.R. back to the beach for me. \nJACKSON Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft.  Back home, we go out squirrel huntin', I walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister. \nREIBEN You know what a B.A.R. weighs? Nineteen and a half pounds, not counting ammo. (re. ammo bandoleers) And you think these things are comfortable?  They may look good but they weigh twelve pounds each, that's thirty-six pounds, right there. \nWADE So what?  I've got three satchel charges, six gammon grenades, a dozen- and-a-half pineapples, and all my regular gear.  You don't hear me complaining. \nREIBEN That's because, as I have pointed out on numerous occasions, you are a happy idiot. \nWADE No, I just happen to take the Captain's advice and look at the bright side of things. \nUPHAM How do you do it? \nWADE It's easy, it runs in my family, take my grandfather, for example... \nREIBEN Oh, Christ, now we gotta listen to that grandfather thing again. \nWADE As I was saying, before I was so rudely interrupted, my grandfather got old, as grandfathers tend to do. He needed someone to take care of him.  We move around all the time, going from one mine to another, so we had to put him in a home.  Nice enough place but kind of depressing. But not for Granddad.  He just convinced himself he was on a cruise ship, going to Tahiti, he had his own cabin, first class, with room service.  It just so happened that the weather was always lousy, so he never bothered to go up on deck. Happiest guy you ever saw until the day he died. \n", "test1_id": 2670, "test2_input": "JACKSON Thirty-ought-six, Norton long-barrel with dual-groove, parallel rifling, elevated three-glass scope and a single-throw hammer. \nUPHAM The Army gave you that? \nJACKSON Yep. \nUPHAM You must be a hell a shot. \nJACKSON Not where I come from. \nJackson sights on a tree about a thousand yards away and FIRES.  Evaluates.  Calibrates the scope.  He re-loads. \nJackson FIRES AGAIN.  Evaluates.  Perfect.  He wipes the dirt and sweat from his forehead, puts his eye to the sight and waits, absolutely motionless. \nUPHAM That must be four thousand yards. \nJACKSON (without taking his eye from the scope) Forty-two-hundred, I figure. \nUPHAM You take account of the wind? \nJackson doesn't dignify that with an answer but he looks back with an expression that clearly says, \"What are you, some kind of fucking idiot?\" Reiben puts himself between Upham and Jackson. \nREIBEN (put-on Southern accent) Dang right, he take 'count of the wind, ain't ya'll ever heard a Kentucky windage? \nJackson keeps his eye to the scope and his finger on the trigger. \nJACKSON Reiben, how many time I got to tell you, I'm from Tennessee. \nREIBEN They got squirrels there, too, right? \nJackson FIRES.  Waits.  A tiny smile.  He starts taking apart the rifle.  A very impressed Captain Hamill barks to his radioman.  Captain Hamill Get a hold of Command, tell them the St. Mere road is open. \nThe Radioman cranks up his radio.  Captain Hamill turns to Miller. \nCaptain Hamill How far back is the rest of division? \nMILLER Very far, they're not coming this way, they're going to take Caen first. \nCaptain Hamill Goddamn it, I was afraid of that.  We're in a lot of trouble up here, and it's gonna get worse before it gets better.  How many men did you bring? \nMILLER Five, but we not staying, we're on our way to Ramelle. \nCaptain hamill Shit, are you the guys going up to find Private Ryan? \nMILLER Yeah, you know about that? \nCaptain hamill Command radioed, wanted to know if he came in with the early wounded or dead. \nSeveral of CAPTAIN HAMILL'S MEN, among them a GENTLE-FACED PRIVATE, prick up their ears at the mention of Private Ryan. \nCaptain hamill We're supposed to tell you, they intercepted a German transmission after you left.  The Krauts have two companies on their way to Ramelle to take back that bridge, they'll be there sometime late tomorrow. \nMILLER Wonderful. \nCaptain Hamill If Ryan's alive, you'd better get him the hell out of there before those Krauts show up. \nMILLER How do we get out of here? \nCaptain hamill You don't, until tonight, we're hemmed in real tight.  After dark you try to slip out to the east.  If you tip-toe, stay off the main roads and roll a few sevens, you've got a fair chance of making it up to Ramelle by tomorrow night. \nMiller processes the information.  Captain Hamill shakes his head. \nCaptain hamill Tough, huh?  Three brothers? \nMiller shrugs. \nCaptain hamill We sure as hell could use your help here, but I understand what you're doing? \nMILLER Yeah? \nCaptain hamill Good luck. \nMILLER Thanks. \nCaptain hamill I mean it.  Find him.  Get him home. \nMiller is a bit taken aback by Captain Hamill's forceful sincerity.  Then he shakes it off and motions to his men. \nMILLER Let's find someplace to hole up. \nMiller nods to Captain Hamill, then, as he moves to the head of the alley, Miller passes Upham. \nUPHAM Sir, I'm sorry about what happened, I... \n", "test2_true": "UPHAM But you could have gotten killed and I... \nMILLER (interrupting) Like I said, it was nothing. (to the men) Don't bunch up. \nHe takes off, crouch-running back down the block.  Upham watches him go. \nUPHAM Did you see what he did, back there? He stepped right into the open, so I could get across. \nJACKSON Shit, that was no big deal. \nWADE They can't kill him. \nSARGE Like hell they can't. \nREIBEN Wade's right, it's some kind of scientific, magnetic thing, I can't explain it, but I've seen it. \nWADE We all have, he's got nine lives, or he's bulletproof, or some damn thing. \nThe men are equal parts joking and admiring.  Sarge is neither. \nSARGE No one's bulletproof.  No one. (beat) C'mon, stay low. \nSarge takes off after Miller. \nEXT. ST. MERE CATHEDRAL - DUSK \nMiller and his men are bivouaced in the middle of the ruins of a medieval church.  Miller, settled into a comfortable spot in the debris, eating his K-rations, looks very relaxed. Reiben paces. \nREIBEN Captain, could you please explain the math of this mission to me? \nMILLER Sure, what do you want to know? \nREIBEN Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one?  What's the sense in risking six guys to save one? \nMILLER Ours is not to reason why. \nREIBEN Huh? \nMILLER Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine. \nREIBEN I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing. \nMILLER Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all. \nREIBEN Easy for you to say, sir. (beat) Fucking James Ryan, I'd like to wring his fucking neck. \nSARGE Jesus, Reiben, think of the poor bastard's mother. \nREIBEN Hey, I got a mother.  Jackson, you got a mother? \nJACKSON Last I knew. \nREIBEN Wade, Sarge, Corporal Insect, all of us, hell, I'll bet even the Captain has a mother. \nMiller smiles.  Reiben eyes him and reconsiders. \nREIBEN Well, maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us have mothers. \nMILLER You have orders, too. \nJACKSON Sir, I have an opinion on this matter. \nMILLER I'd love to hear it. \nJACKSON Seems to me, Cap'n, this mission is a serious misallocation of valuable military resources.  Miller Go on. \nJACKSON Well, sir, by my way a thinkin' I am a finely made instrument of warfare. What I mean by that is, if you was to put me with this here sniper rifle anywhere up to and includin' one mile from Adolf Hitler, with a clear line of sight, war's over. \nMiller nods. \nMILLER Reiben, I want you to listen closely to Jackson.  This is the way to gripe. Jackson, continue. \nJACKSON Yes, sir.  It seems to me, sir, that the entire resources of the United States Army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only, and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop, smack-dab in the middle of Berlin, Germany.  Now I ain't one to question decisions made up on high, sir, but it seems to me that saving one private, no matter how grievous the losses of his family, is a waste of my God-given talent. \nMILLER Wade? \nWADE Hell, I don't mind this mission, sir, as long as there's something up at Ramelle for... \nREIBEN (finishing Wade's sentence) ...for you to blow up, yeah, yeah, we heard that. \nMILLER Upham? \n", "test2_id": 2671, "test3_input": "Then they proceed with the next.  Upham is covering their tracks while Jackson is digging the holes in which they'll place the rest of the mines. \nEXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT \nQuiet.  Dark.  Everything is ready.  There's nothing to do now but wait. \nON THE BRIDGEKEEPERS HUT \nReiben and Jackson sit behind the sandbags.  They can see Ryan sitting in the moonlight about twenty yards away, manning the rear machine gun nest with Sarge. \nREIBEN What do you think? \nJACKSON I think I'm we got that eighty-eight. \nREIBEN I mean, Ryan, what do you think of him? \nJackson shrugs. \nJACKSON He ain't half-bad, I guess. \nREIBEN I guess. \nThey're quiet for a moment. \nJACKSON He ain't Wade. \nREIBEN Nope, he ain't Wade. \nTheir eyes keep coming back to Ryan. \nMILLER Crouch-runs through the shadows and stops at the bridgekeepers hut. \nMILLER Reiben... \nMiller points, directing Reiben to the forward machine gun nest. \nREIBEN Yes, sir. \nREIBEN jumps down and moves forward. \nMILLER runs across the bridge and joins Sarge and Ryan in the rear machine gun nest. \nMILLER You set?  Sarge nods. \nRYAN Yes, sir. \nMiller and Sarge exchange a look.  Then Miller slips off to check the others. \nEXT. BRIDGE - DAWN \nFirst light.  The Americans are ready for battle.  WE SEE them in their positions: \nREIBEN AND UPHAM Manning the forward machine gun nest. \nJACKSON Behind the sandbags, on top of the bridgekeeper's hut. \nFORREST AND THE PARATROOPERS \nBehind the second of two barricades set up between the forward and the rear machine gun nests. \nRYAN AND SARGE Manning rear machine gun. \nMILLER At the bridgehead, waiting. \nSOUND FROM DOWN THE ROAD \nAll eyes turn. \nSINGLE GERMAN SOLDIER \nDashes across the street.  Exposed only for an instant. Then another.  And another. \nMILLER Cocks his Thompson.  Settles down behind some sandbags. \nMILLER HERE THEY COME! \nA RUSH OF GERMANS ADVANCE, BLASTING AT THE BRIDGE. \nTHE AMERICANS RETURN FIRE \nREIBEN OPENS UP with the MACHINE GUN. \nTHE GERMANS At least fifty of them, advancing on the bridge.  Running from cover to cover.  A squad pushing a French truck, using it as a shield. \n", "test3_true": "THE GERMAN INFANTRYMEN Make their way down the streets. Along the riverbank.  Through the houses.  There are GERMANS FIRING from all directions. \nREIBEN FIRES IN ARCS. \nMILLER Sees Reiben and Upham being cut off. Grabs the B.A.R., stands and fires. \nREIBEN AND UPHAM Running out of ammo.  See that there's nothing else they can do. \nREIBEN Time to go. \nReiben rolls out of the nest, carrying the fifty caliber. Upham follows, carrying the ammo boxes.  They run as fast as they can. \nTHE OTHER AMERICANS FIRE COVER \nREIBEN takes a glancing slug.  Falls.  Rolls and gets up. Bleeding from the side, but not mortal.  Upham helps him. \nThey MAKE IT TO THE SANDBAGS of the first barricade. \nDIVE OVER.  The Germans are almost on them. \nRYAN IS FIRING With the rear MACHINE GUN.  Drops several Germans. \nGERMANS EVERYWHERE They swarm over the first barricade. \nMILLER FIRES A BURST into a German's belly. HITS another with the stock of his Thompson. \nHAND-TO-HAND. \nFORREST AND THE OTHER PARATROOPERS \nFIRING COVER for Miller, Reiben and Upham, don't see a flanking Germans squad easing along the riverbanks.  Two of the Germans LOB POTATO MASHERS among the paratroopers.  THE PARATROOPERS see the grenades.  Too late. \nTHE POTATO MASHERS EXPLODE KILLING FORREST AND THE OTHER PARATROOPERS RYAN SEES FORREST AND THE OTHERS DIE \nNo time to react. \nHAND-TO-HAND FIGHTING Half a dozen Germans break through. \nMiller KILLS TWO MORE WITH A BURST. \nRYAN Is jumped on by one.  Upham FIRES. KILLS the German. \nMILLER Struggling with a pair of Germans. \nJACKSON FIRES.  Drops one of the Germans on Miller with a head shot.  Cuts open Miller's face with bits of skull. \nRYAN Leaps onto the final German attacking Miller.  That German raises his rifle on Ryan. \nUPHAM AND REIBEN AND JACKSON \nAll see it.  SIMULTANEOUSLY SHOOT the German. \nTHE STUNNED GERMAN About to kill Ryan.  Torn apart by bullets from three directions. \nUPHAM I got him. \nREIBEN Like hell you did, I got him. \nJACKSON SMILES He got him. \nMILLER SLAMS in a fresh clip.  FIRES an arc.  DROPS four Germans.  Sees an oncoming RUSH OF GERMANS.  BARKS to Reiben and Upham: \nMILLER BACK!  LET'S GO! \nThey retreat, firing back as best they can, trying to make it to the barricade. \nSARGE Sees them in deep trouble.  Leaves Ryan firing the rear machine gun. Grabs the B.A.R. ADVANCES, FIRING COVER.  Exposed. \nBULLETS EVERYWHERE MILLER, REIBEN, UPHAM make it to the barricade.  Dive over. \nSARGE Sees they've made it.  FIRES A FINAL BURST.  Races for cover.  A trail of bullets right behind him. \nTHE OTHER AMERICANS FIRE for all they're worth.  Trying to cover Sarge.  Too many Germans. \nSARGE TAKES A SHOT IN THE BACK.  FALLS.

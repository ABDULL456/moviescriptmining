On the windshield of the Malibu in huge white letters: 
MIKE Nothing with a trunk. 
LILA That thing has been sittin' here for six months. 
MIKE I don't want Bernie in my face. Okay? 
LILA He doesn't have to know. 
Mike rolls his eyes.

Ray wakes up with Ricky staring at her. 
RICKY Mommy, I was thinking. What's gonna happen to the tin crapper when we get our new house? 
RAY (half asleep) They're gonna flatten it out and send it to China. 
RICKY Then what? 
RAY They're gonna melt it down and make little toys out if it. 
RICKY Then what? 
RAY They'll send them back here so I can sell them at All for a Dollar. 
RICKY And you can buy me some? 
RAY That's right. 
RICKY Yes! 
38   INT. RAY'S TRAILER, KITCHEN - DAY                          38 
Ray puts out a breakfast spread of Microwave popcorn and tang. 
T.J. I'm not eatin' that again for dinner. 
RAY We just have to make it to my paycheck on Friday. 
T.J. What about Rentacenter? 
She searches through the couch cushions. 
RAY What about them? 
T.J. They said they're coming to get the furniture if they don't get a payment by 4 o'clock. 
RAY You told me that already. 
She finds change and hands it to him. 
RAY (CONT'D) Here, lunch money. 
She gives the rest to Ricky. 
T.J. Look I don't see why you won't just let me get a job with Mitch. 
RAY (to T.J.) Who's Mitch. 
T.J. He's got like this whole business he runs. 
RAY He sells pot to kids? 
T.J. No, it's computers. He works on computers. 
RAY You're fifteen, it's not gonna happen so forget it. 
T.J. That's so stupid. We're gonna lose the TV while I'm sitting in some Christmas assembly when I could be- 
RAY Your job is looking after your brother. Who's gonna take care of him? 
T.J. (going out the door) I still say we should go back to the rez, get the Horizon and kick some serious butt. 
T.J. goes out the door behind Ricky and slams it in Ray's face. 
Ray slips into her jeans and goes to the bathroom mirror to put on her mascara. She cakes it on trying to ignore the cut over her eye but keeps looking at it. Finally she stops and stares at herself. 
CUT TO: 
39   EXT. LILA'S CAMPER - DAY                                    39 
Ray pulls up in front of the camper and stops. 
The Horizon is still there and all is quiet. 
Ray gets out holding the gun and a long rope goes to the bumper and begins to tie it to the other bumper, looking over her shoulder every once in while at the camper.

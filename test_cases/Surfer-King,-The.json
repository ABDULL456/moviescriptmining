Aokee seems to think that one day some concessions kid with more courage than brains is going to beat the lifeguards in the annual Employee Olympics. \nROBBIE And what would this concessions kid have to do? \nALEX Nothing, really. Just out surf the strongest guard of them all in the surfing competition. No big deal. \nROBBIE Has it ever happened? \nALEX A guard always wins the surf competition. Know why? \nTOGETHER (ROBBIE and ALEX) Because concessions kids can't swim! \nAOKEE (still cleaning) Someday. \nThey go back into AOKEE'S SURF AND SNACK SHACK. \n30        INT MOMENTS LATER -DAY- AOKEE'S SURF AND SNACK SHACK           30 \nROBBIE is now behind the counter making smoothies.

On break? \nKATIE Yeah.   Two Blue Crushes please. \nROBBIE Coming up. \nHe shakes a mix container, blends it for about 5 seconds and pours it out into two cups. He then puts in two umbrellas with pineapple. \nAMY Oooh. Umbrellas.       I've never gotten umbrellas before. \nROBBIE These are only for VIP guests. \nAMY looks over to KATIE and rolls her eyes. \nALEX arrives at this point, and decides to provide a distraction. \nALEX Amy. Have you ever seen the fabulous Cummings and Robbins 2000-B? \nAMY (shaking her head) I don't think so. \nAs he leads her back into the kitchen... \nALEX It's incredible.      It washes 2000 plates an hour.... \nKATIE (to ROBBIE) So... you're not from around here, huh? \nROBBIE California. I just moved here at the beginning of the summer. \nKATIE I'll bet California's nice.      I've never been west of the mountains. \nPage 35 of 81 \nROBBIE You'd love the ocean. And the sunsets are incredible. You can almost hear the sizzle as the sun drops into the ocean... (daydreaming a bit) Of course, we all know it doesn't drop into the ocean. \n", "test1_true": "ROBBIE Let's just say I missed my chance, and Alex saved me from a death worse than fate. I was very nearly a trash rat. \nKATIE (frowns) Oh. Good save. \nALEX has distracted AMY all he could and they return from the kitchen. \nAMY Well. That was exciting. Maybe next time you can show me how to scrub the grill. Come on, Katie. \nThey leave. \nALEX (to ROBBIE, interested) Well...how'd you do? \nROBBIE (thinking) Mmmm. I told her how beautiful the California sunsets are. \nALEX Good job. You work fast. Hey it's time for our break. Bring your swimsuit? \nROBBIE Yeah.   The Wave? \nALEX The Wave.    I love that water. \nROBBIE looks confused. \nALEX (CONT'D) Can't swim. It's only three inches deep. \nROBBIE (grabbing his suit and a towel) Ah ha! Let's go. \nPage 36 of 81 \n31        EXT -MOMENTS LATER - THE WAVE AREA                             31 \nROBBIE and ALEX have their swimsuits on, and are in line to get on THE WAVE. ALEX is coaching ROBBIE. \nALEX Now, just take it easy, and don't expect too much at first. When you wipe out, your ride is done. \nALEX is up now, and he grabs the board and jumps in. He is pretty good, but not nearly as good as the WAVE BUMS. He does a few tricks and wipes out. He gets up and walks up to the line to watch ROBBIE. \nALEX (CONT'D) (shouting) Just ease into it. \nROBBIE takes the board and looks around. He jumps full force onto the wave. It takes him just a moment to get the feel of the board, and then he is all over it, making the WAVE BUMS look like rookies. Spins, rolls, everything that can be done he does. Finally, the guard blows a whistle indicating that his time is up. \nALEX (CONT'D) (meeting him at the exit) Gees. Where did you learn to do that? \nROBBIE I'm from Oceanside, California.    I was born on a surfboard. \nThey start walking back. \nThey stop for a moment to look at Thunder Bay. Just then a wave spews out, and kids on tubes are screaming as they always do. \nALEX Think you could ride that? \nROBBIE (looking right into ALEX's eyes) In my sleep. \nALEX just smiles. \n32        INT - LATER THAT DAY - AOKEE'S SURF & SNACK SHACK              32 \nAOKEE is cleaning up behind the counter.

Move ten feet further away from the back wall. \nROBBIE (to himself) The ocean never had a back wall. (to Pipeman) Thank you. \nROBBIE paddles over to the spot suggested by PIPEMAN. AOKEE and ALEX are now sitting on the edge of the lawn chairs anxiously awaiting the next wave. It comes and ROBBIE catches it easily and begins riding it aggressively. He has a good run and kicks out at the end. \nAOKEE and ALEX high-five. \nALEX AND AOKEE (together) Yeee-haww. \nThey settle back into their chairs to absorb some sun. \n52        INT.

RICHARD, head lifeguard is on the other side; he will get the smoothie. \nRICHARD (grinning) So. I hear he's pretty good.     Haven't seen him myself yet. \nAOKEE (concerned, covering) Good? Good at what? Who you mean? \nPage 54 of 81 \nRICHARD Come on. Your ringer from California. Everyone says he's gonna give Cowboy a run for his money. \nAOKEE Robbie?    Robbie barely walk without help. \nWe hear a loud CRASH from the kitchen. \nRICHARD Gees! \nAOKEE Ha! \nAOKEE gestures back towards the kitchen. \nAOKEE (CONT'D) Your Surfer King. We just make a good show. Your boy have nothing to worry about. \nRICHARD You know I'd feel a lot better if you hadn't taken most of my money in that poker game last Friday night. \nAOKEE (dismissive) Poker? Not an island game.     I no good. \nRICHARD (nods) Right. Tell you what. Sight unseen even money, twenty dollars on Cowboy. \nAOKEE You want to bet with me? Take my twenty dollars, just like that? Humph. Not worth the trouble, twenty dollars. Now, maybe a hundred... \nRICHARD A hundred bucks... \nANOTHER CRASH from the kitchen, this time pots & pans. \nAOKEE (to kitchen) Robbie! \nRICHARD OK, a hundred bucks. \nThey slap hands to seal the deal.    RICHARD leaves, grinning and shaking his head. \nAOKEE (to kitchen) \nPage 55 of 81 \nRobbie?   That you?

PIPEMAN is at the side, ROBBIE is in the water on his board. \nPIPEMAN (gesturing) OK, now this time, get up on the board more quickly. This is a wave pool and this wave dissipates quickly. You only have a little time to show your stuff. \nROBBIE How will the judging work? \nPIPEMAN You get a possible ten points. Three for your surfing, three for your style and four for the judge's overall impression of your ride. No one's ever gotten a ten...I'm not really sure why. \nROBBIE You've seen the competition.     What does everybody do? \nPIPEMAN Everybody just surfs, man and tries not to fall. The big reason Cowboy's done so \nPage 56 of 81 \nwell is he goes to Hawaii for a couple weeks every year. But there he's mostly a longboarder. Your job is to figure out how to make the most outta this little wave. \nROBBIE OK.   I'm ready. \nThe wave comes and ROBBIE catches it and surfs it hard, kicking up high at the end. \n54        EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - HILL ABOVE THUNDER BAY          54 \nWE SEE COWBOY and TIFFANY standing overlooking Thunder Bay. COWBOY has binoculars and is looking through them. \nCOWBOY He's pretty good, I'll give him that. \nTIFFANY (concerned) How good? \nCOWBOY If I have an off day, he could win. \nTIFFANY (really concerned) That's terrible. You're the Surfer King. \nCOWBOY Well, some days you get the wave, and some days the wave gets you. \nTIFFANY This can't happen.   What are we gonna do? \nCOWBOY I don't know what you're going to do, but as me for me, I'm gonna schedule some practice time of my own. \nTIFFANY This may take a lot more than extra practice. \nCOWBOY Well, I don't know what else you expect. I'll go out and do my best. If that's not enough, it's not enough. \nTIFFANY grabs the binoculars and stares down at Thunder Bay. WE SEE gears turning in her head. \n55        EXT.

You guys see it on snowboarders here all the time, I'm sure. \nALEX Oh yeah, I'm sure I did that last winter. But not on purpose! Dude. You're either gonna win this thing or you're gonna die. \nAOKEE (quickly, eagerly) It would be better if you won. \nROBBIE Yeah, well, a tie is like kissing your sister. \nALEX (mock anger) You stay away from my sister. \nWe hear an air horn blast.      They are ready to start. \nPIPEMAN Ready! \nROBBIE (to PIPEMAN) I'll need the biggest wave you can give me... \nPIPEMAN (imitating Mr. Scott on Star \nPage 77 of 81 \nTrek) I'll give 'er all she's got, Cap'n! \nHe hands Robbie the board. ALEX heads back to the bleachers area, PIPEMAN goes to the pumphouse in back of Thunder Bay. \nAOKEE hangs back with ROBBIE and speaks to him alone. \nAOKEE (dropping his Hawaiian accent) Robbie. When you do this, do this mostly for Robbie Zirpollo. But do it just a little bit for Manny Ramirez, eh? \nAOKEE smiles and pats him on the back.    Robbie nods.    They head for the bay. \n71        EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - THUNDER BAY                       71 \nCOWBOY is in the water paddling out to get his wave. It comes and he has apparently decided to stay with what has gotten him this far; a conservative style that keeps him looking good without falling. His ride is similar to the last one, but even more graceful and lyrical and he gets a 9. \nALEX (to ROBBIE) Looks like he's waiting for you to make a mistake. You sure you know what you're doing? \nROBBIE I'm just making this up as I go along. \nALEX Works for me! Go get 'em. \nROBBIE appears on the seawall holding his board and looking out first at the bay, then at the crowd. His mom, CONNIE waves, and he smiles weakly. \nHE sees KATIE and she looks hopeful. She hasn't given up on him completely. He smiles at her and gets into the water. \nHe begins paddling. It seems to take forever for him to get out to the spot where he catches the wave, but he finally arrives. \nHe sits there for a moment, collecting himself, then raises his hand to signal he is ready. \nThe CONCESSIONS KIDS have started to chant, ROBBIE! ROBBIE! The guards are anxious, but even they can't help moving to the cadence of the chant. \nThe wave comes and he catches it quickly, and slips his feet into the duct tape pockets. He misses one pocket at first, then gets it in. \nHe rides it carefully and at the right moment slides up to \nPage 78 of 81 \nthe top and executes a full 360 degree turn out of the water. \nOn landing back on the downside of the wave, he slides down it quickly, and then turns around with a deep cut and heads straight into the wave. At the top he bounces and does a complete back flip in slow motion. \nWe see the crowd also in slow motion. AOKEE Is covering his eyes, he can't watch. ALEX's face is contorted with disbelief. Various faces in the crowd are in open-mouthed disbelief. THE JUDGES are staring intently, focussed so as not to miss anything. \nROBBIE lands the flip, and rides the rest of the wave.      He waves to the crowd, and kicks off, exhausted. \n", "test3_true": "COWBOY knows he's in trouble. \nTHE JUDGES confer only momentarily and the score 10 appears, and the word concessions starts flashing along with the word winner. COWBOY nods in agreement. \nTIFFANY says something to him, and he appears angry.      We can only hear part of his response, something like: \nCOWBOY (disbelief) You did WHAT? \nAOKEE and ALEX lead him up to the grandstand. COWBOY also makes his way up there, and we see him talking to BIG MIKE. BIG MIKE nods in agreement and COWBOY goes to the mike as the crowd settles down. \nCOWBOY (CONT'D) As last year's Surfer King, it's my privilege to present this year's trophy to the most amazing surfer on the water today. Robbie! Congratulations. \nCOWBOY shakes ROBBIE's hand, and ROBBIE speaks at the mike. \nROBBIE (holding trophy) I just want to thank Aokee, Alex and Katie for all their support. \nWe see KATIE clapping, crying.   AOKEE and ALEX are clapping and smiling. \nROBBIE (CONT'D) And I have just one thing to say to everyone in concessions. WE DID IT! \nROBBIE holds the trophy high as everyone cheers. \nPage 79 of 81 \nFADE TO BLACK. \n72        EXT. EARLY EVENING SURFS WAVE POOL                              72 \nGrounds kids are stacking chairs in preparation for final closing. Tarps are being thrown over everything and tied down. \nAwnings are being taken down.     Chairs and tables are being moved. \nWe see JAFFA packing up his CD's into that cardboard box.       HE also snaps the winter covers for the sound equipment into place. \n73        EXT. MOMENTS LATER - EVENING TIME OUT SHACK                     73 \nA banner hangs over the time shack, \"Thanks for another great year\". ALEX, ROBBIE, KATIE and AMY are clocking out for the final time this summer. \nThey all stop and look around one final time.     Suddenly TIFFANY drives up in her convertible. \nTIFFANY Another summer gone. How about it Robbie? You gonna guard next year?      They could use your help. \nThey all walk closer to her car. \nROBBIE I don't know...we have a pretty good time at AOKEE's. \nTIFFANY You know, that's what I hear. Maybe I should work there next summer. \nALEX, ROBBIE, KATIE and AMY all say these lines pretty much at the same time. \nROBBIE You wouldn't like it... \nALEX That's a bad idea... \nKATIE And you're such a good guard... \nAMY You'd be miserable... \nTIFFANY Maybe you're right.

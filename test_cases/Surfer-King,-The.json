{"train": "THE SURFER KING \nWritten by \nBernard Murray Jr \nPage 1 of 81 \nTHE SURFER KING \n1       EXT. EARLY MORNING. - CUSTOMER SERVICE KIOSK                          1 \nJAFFA, a Jamaican looking fellow in his early 20's, arrives at Water World, carrying a dusty cardboard box. \nThere are a few workers milling about, setting up the park for opening. He passes EDDIE, a 25-something grounds worker with Down's Syndrome. \nJAFFA Eddie! \nEDDIE (smiling, nodding) Jaffa. \nThey do a hand slap maneuver that they have obviously worked out some time in the past. JAFFA proceeds up to the Customer Relations Kiosk, plops the box on the counter, and enters the kiosk. We see him open the box, it is full of CD's. \nHe pulls winter covers off of an overhead area to reveal a CD player and amplifiers. He starts pushing buttons he's pushed a thousand times, and lights come on. He pulls down a microphone, and clicks a button to see if it works. \nHe reaches into the box of CDs and pulls one out. We see it is Sheryl Crow. He gets the CD, examines it, and pops it into the CD player. \nHe once again picks the microphone and flips the switch as he pushes the \"play\" button on the CD player. \nHis voice echoes through the park.         \"Soak up the Sun\" begins playing. \nJAFFA (smiling) Ladies and Gentlemen, Water World will be open in (checking his watch) twenty-six hours and forty-three minutes. \nGFX - OPENING CREDITS BEGIN \n2       EXT EARLY MORNING - THUNDER BAY                                    2 \nBIG MIKE, the park's owner/manager - a 50-something man who is portly and bald, and RICHARD THOMPSON, head lifeguard and another GUARD are on the east side of Thunder Bay. \nThere is a post with a box on top of it that has a winter cover on it. The GUARD is standing there with a garden hose \nPage 2 of 81 \nholding it so the water goes into Thunder Bay. \nHe is obviously tired, and has been standing there a long time. We look back at the massive size of the pool and get the joke. \nBIG MIKE and RICHARD pull off the winter cover. The GUARD turns to look and the hose turns with him, getting BIG MIKE wet. They object and he turns back to filling Thunder Bay. RICHARD moves the GUARD to a safe distance. \nBIG MIKE blows the dust off of the box at the top of the post, and we see it is a large push button. BIG MIKE looks at RICHARD who nods \"go ahead\" and then pushes the button. \nThey both draw back as if something big should happen, but nothing. They look at each other and BIG MIKE motions for RICHARD to go over to the wall housing the wave tank for the pool. \nRICHARD waves OK, and BIG MIKE pushes the button again. When nothing happens, RICHARD whacks the side of the tank with his closed fist. Suddenly a huge wave rolls out. \nNodding his approval, BIG MIKE checks off an item in his clipboard. \n3       EXT. EARLY MORNING. - DAY   SURFS UP AREA                       3 \nWe see people working to open the park. The VAIL PRECISION LAWN CHAIR DRILL TEAM dressed in Water World uniforms is setting and arranging chairs in time to the music. They perform precision maneuvers with the chairs, as if rifles, and cross each other in a timed march to the music. \n4       EXT. EARLY MORNING. - DAY   FUN HOUSE AREA                      4 \nBIG MIKE is standing under the Fun House structure with a clipboard. He is talking to RICHARD. \nALEX looks in his wallet, as do we.    It is empty. \nROBBIE (nodding) I'm Robbie. Robbie Zirpollo. \nALEX I'm Alex.     Where you workin'? \nROBBIE I believe it's with the Grounds Crew? \nALEX What's the matter, can't swim? \nROBBIE (surprised) I can swim. Why? \nALEX Well, you look old enough to be a guard. \nROBBIE Almost 16.     I get my license in September. \nALEX It's just that most of the guys on grounds are a little younger than you. Most guys your age that can swim are guards. \nROBBIE Well, I just moved here. I guess I missed guard tryouts. You're a guard then? \nALEX Oh, no no no. I work concessions...at Aokee's Surf and Snack Shack. It's just as well. The guards are mostly stuck up anyway. The rest of us are the ones who know how to have fun. \nROBBIE Can't swim, huh? \nALEX (smiling) Nope. \nROBBIE (listening to speaker on post above) What is that? \nALEX (mimicking his perception of surfers) Surf tunes, dude! \nPage 6 of 81 \n(back to his own voice) You'll get used to it. You'll get to where you miss it. I had to buy two CD's just to get through the winter. \nThey are now at the front of the line. A teenage girl MELISSA is sitting at the table with papers and a clipboard. \nALEX (CONT'D) (gesturing) Ahh. And here we have the fair Melissa, time clerk extraordinaire... \nMELISSA (shaking her head no) Oh, Alex. Am I going to have to put up with your crap for another entire summer? \nALEX (looking upward toward the sky) Dear Melissa. There's nothing about our relationship that couldn't be fixed by us spending a few moments together in the pumphouse behind Thunder Bay. \nMELISSA Yeah, well from what I hear, it would be a BRIEF few moments. \nROBBIE (wincing) Ouch. \nALEX (not missing a beat) My dear, you cut me to the quick. Check off my name and that of my amigo here, Mr. Robbie Zirpollo. \nMELISSA (handing them cards) Fill out these emergency cards, and turn them in when you pick up your uniforms.... (pointing) over there. And Alex? \nALEX (to ROBBIE) She wants me. (turning back to MELISSA) Yeeees? \nMELISSA (finger pointing) This year, let's clock in only our OWN time card, shall we? \nALEX \nPage 7 of 81 \n(head shaking, to ROBBIE, walking together) Some people have no sense of humor. \n8       EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - OUTSIDE UNIFORM BUILDING         8 \nROBBIE and ALEX walk up to yet another line of about 4 or 5 teens. At the front a teenage girl and a teenage guy are behind a counter and handing out uniforms based on a clipboard list. \nWE SEE him on a pay phone behind the counter. \nAOKEE (to person on the line) David...how you do this to me? I have full staff with you. I save your spot. I was counting on you. (listens, nods) Yes, yes....but The Gap? What you think you do there? Are there girls in swimming suits? Have you forgotten? (listens, shaking head) Tips. Do you get tips? Cash money? (listens some more) \nALEX walks up.   AOKEE waves to him.   He is obviously upset. \nAOKEE (CONT'D) (resigned) Well, come see us this summer, eh? You're a good kid...a good worker.     Yeah, you too. \nAOKEE hangs up the phone. \nALEX Who....? \nAOKEE David. Seems to think there is future in retail. Now what I do? I'm one person short. Park opens tomorrow. \nAOKEE buries his head in his hands on the counter. \nALEX (thinking) You know...I just met a guy that's old \nPage 10 of 81 \nenough to work here, but he's stuck in grounds. \nAOKEE (perking up) Good guy? \nALEX Seemed like our kind of people. \nAOKEE thinks for a moment. He glances up towards Surf's Up. It hits both he and ALEX at the same time... \nAOKEE We need to get him before he get his plunger! \nThey take off running. \n10        EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - TRAIL FROM AOKEE'S TO SURF'S10 UP \nAOKEE and ALEX are running together. They get about 50 feet before AOKEE, large man that he is, runs out of breath. ALEX, like a boxer in training, sort of runs in place, keeping loose, ready for AOKEE to catch his wind. Off they go again, get another 50 feet, and the same thing happens. \nAOKEE (out of breath) Alex...... (wheeze) ..you got to go ahead... (wheeze) ...stall 'til I get there. \nALEX (nodding, running in place) OK. \nALEX takes off, and AOKEE runs again.... \n11        EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - SURF'S UP WAVE POOL SOUTH          11 \nWE SEE several rolling trash cans lined up in a row, along with several janitorial carts filled with cleaning utensils and supplies. \nTHE COLONEL is standing, dressed in army fatigue pants and a Water World golf shirt, with a green Water World baseball cap. He is wearing black horn-rim glasses, thick lenses, and carrying a clipboard. \nLined up as if an army unit are ten grounds kids, including ROBBIE, who is sixth furthest from THE COLONEL. They are all younger than ROBBIE except one, EDDIE, whom we met at the beginning of the film. \nEDDIE is standing tall and straight, proud to be there.      He is nearest THE COLONEL \nPage 11 of 81 \nTHE COLONEL (looking up from clipboard) Well, it looks like we have a good staff here. Yes...yes a good staff. It will be an excellent summer. Remember as we go through training today, our park is judged by the work WE do. If we do it well, the people come back. (walking up and down the line) We have a little tradition here on the grounds crew. Rather than having to learn a lot of names, many of which I can never hope to pronounce properly, each grounds crew member gets a grounds crew nickname. You will be known by that nickname in every way except, of course, your paycheck and employee records. \nTHE COLONEL looks over his paperwork. \nTHE COLONEL    (CONT'D) Let's see, what do we    have? Hmm...yes. OK, first up is Eddie    Cochran. Your grounds crew nickname    will be.....Eddie! \nEDDIE smiles knowingly. This has been his grounds crew nickname for the last 8 years, mostly because he would never answer to anything else, and THE COLONEL gave up trying. \nTHE COLONEL (CONT'D) Now crewmembers, listen up. Eddie here has eight years experience on the grounds crew. Why, I'd like to think there isn't anything, any situation that Eddie hasn't faced. Listen to him. Learn from him. Watch what he does. This man is the finest, most conscientious grounds crewman we've ever had. \nTHE COLONEL (to himself) I never forget a grounds nickname.... \nAOKEE has finally made it now, but is, of course, out of breath again. \nTHE COLONEL (CONT'D) \nPage 14 of 81 \n(concerned) Aokee, good God, man...are you OK? \nAOKEE gestures he is fine, and does a combination of charades and Hawaiian pantomime before he finally speaks. \nAOKEE Colonel....terrible mistake... \nALEX gets behind AOKEE, deciding he needs some help, feeding him words. \nALEX (quietly behind AOKEE) Bureaucratic bumble... \nAOKEE Bureaucratic bumble.... \nALEX Lost paperwork.... \nAOKEE Lost paperwork.... \nALEX An error in the front office... \nAOKEE Error in front office.... \nALEX Spiced applesauce.... \nAOKEE Spiced... \nAOKEE stops, turn and glares at ALEX, who merely smiles and shrugs. \nTHE COLONEL Good God, man, what are you trying to say? \nALEX comes around from behind AOKEE. \nALEX It's Robbie sir. He was supposed to work at Aokee's and through some crazy mix-up, he ended up here. \nTHE COLONEL (looking at clipboard) Zirpollo? Well this is highly irregular... \nHe is flipping though the papers, confused. \nALEX (can't pass this up) \nPage 15 of 81 \nMost annoying.... \nTHE COLONEL Most annoying.... \nALEX Never happened before.... \nTHE COLONEL Never happened before.... \nALEX Spaghetti marinara... \nTHE COLONEL Spa....what? (exasperated) Well, if he was supposed to be assigned to you, we'll just have to let him go... \nROBBIE has caught on and is quick to step out of line, and pick up his shirt to be ready to go. \nROBBIE (to THE COLONEL) I was confused myself, sir. I had heard I was working for some Hawaiian guy. \nRICHARD (CONT'D) (almost quietly to the stunned crowd) Thank you. Have a great summer! \nThere is stunned silence for a moment.    They're not sure how to react. \nALEX \nPage 18 of 81 \n(breaking the silence) Alright! Whoo whoo! \nALEX, then everyone begins applauding. ROBBIE looks at ALEX quizzically, ALEX just shrugs. The meeting breaks up. \n13        INT - MORNING - THE NEXT DAY - AOKEE'S SURF & SNACK SHACK      13 \nEveryone is hurrying around, getting ready for opening day. ROBBIE, wearing his new blue Hawaiian shirt, is cutting pineapple. AOKEE is busy hovering over everyone, and cooking chicken on the grill. ALEX walks in. \nALEX (to ROBBIE) Hey, hey lookin' good. Blue is your color. Beats that stupid t-shirt, huh? \nAOKEE (unhappy, stressed) Alex! You are late. Come on, is opening day! \nROBBIE finishes the pineapple and hands the tray to AOKEE, almost spilling it. \nAOKEE (CONT'D) (to ROBBIE and ALEX) You two start setting tables. \nALEX takes a pile of silverware wrapped in napkins, and points to ROBBIE to grab a box of sugar packets to refill the dispensers. ROBBIE grabs it quickly, enthusiastically, but loses his grip and spills the packets on the floor. \nAt that moment, AUDREY a girl in her teens who works at AOKEE'S and is stacking plastic cups on the counter, accidentally knocks a stack of cups to the ground. \nRAMON, a teenage boy who works there is behind the counter. He bends over, disappearing, and we hear a crash of pots and pans. His head peers up from below the counter sheepishly. \nAOKEE turns from the grill looking at all this, and has a worried look, but smiles and shrugs weakly. \nAOKEE (CONT'D) (to ALEX, gesturing) Alex. Come here a minute. \nALEX comes up close next to him at the grill so they can talk. \nAOKEE (CONT'D) (with intensity) Alex, look. We falling apart. I made you assistant manager this year. Go assistant manage. \nALEX \nPage 19 of 81 \n(agreeing) No problem. \nALEX pops a CD out of the rack above the sound system, and puts it in the CD player, stopping the standard pastoral Hawaiian music that has been playing. \nHe turns up the volume some on the amp, and goes over to SARAH, a teenage girl working there, and grabs her grass skirt by the Velcro, removing it with a Velcro rip. \nALEX (CONT'D) Sorry, Sarah, but I need to borrow this. \nSARAH (surprised) Hey! How did you know I wear shorts under that? \nALEX (mock surprise, rolling his eyes) Oh, Puh-leeaase. \nALEX walks back out to the dining area, everyone is still working. \nALEX (CONT'D) (to all) Ladies and Gentlemen, may I have your attention, please? \nEveryone stops and looks at ALEX. \nALEX (CONT'D) In exactly 30 minutes, hundreds of dripping wet customers with fistfuls of money smelling of chlorine and suntan lotion will be walking in here. And what will they be looking for? (as if directing a choir) \nEVERYONE TOGETHER (except ROBBIE, who doesn't know any better) The best teriyaki east of the pacific!!! \nROBBIE (incredulous) Busier? \nALEX (laughing) Don't worry. You'll get used to it.      And tips were good, right? \nPage 22 of 81 \nROBBIE There's nothing like cash money in your pocket. What's that over there? \nThey are coming up on THE WAVE area. \nALEX Oh, you'll find this ride interesting. \n16        EXT - MOMENTS LATER - DAY - THE WAVE AREA                      16 \nThe walk up to THE WAVE attraction, where kids are surfing in a high-water pressure river/ sheet of water. Surf music plays loudly here, and kids are doing all kinds of tricks. Some riders are good, some are not, and fall quickly. \nWe also see SKEETER and SNITCH, the tall skinny and short chubby grounds kids we met earlier. They are cleaning up around the exit area of THE WAVE. \nALEX (as a rider falls) It's a lot harder than it looks. \nROBBIE I can't imagine it's that difficult. (to himself) ...no rudder on the board... \nALEX Now this is a place of many wonders.     See those guys in line over there? \nWE SEE some guys that look a little stoned with unusual hair laughing and talking to each other. \nALEX (CONT'D) We call them \"Wave Bums\". They all have season passes, and do little more than ride the wave all day long. Some of them get pretty good. \nAlex points up to a fence, behind which some smoke appears to be drifting up. \nALEX (CONT'D) That's where they hang out when they're not riding the wave. Don't get too close to them. \nROBBIE No? \nALEX (sniffing) Contact high. \nROBBIE nods, understanding. ALEX points back to THE WAVE. \nPage 23 of 81 \nALEX (CONT'D) And there, my friend, is another one of The Wave's features. \nWE SEE a pretty girl in line to ride. \nALEX (CONT'D) We call them \"Wave Babes\". And there's a special secret to this ride. \nWith that ALEX walks over to BOB, a guy in his late teens, wearing a Security Golf Shirt. He is standing and looking off in a different direction. \nALEX (CONT'D) Hey, Bob....can I borrow your radio a minute? \nBOB Sure. \nHe hands him the radio, and ALEX is back with ROBBIE. \nALEX (into radio) Hey Frank, it's Alex. \nALEX waves and FRANK, the guard watching THE WAVE waves back. \nFRANK VO (heard through the radio) Yo, Alex. \nALEX (into radio) Listen you have a possible code 4. (to ROBBIE) Means a \"hottie\". \nALEX (CONT'D) (to radio) She's up next. A free chicken sandwich and a smoothie if you bounce up the pressure a bit. \nDOUG And hey...tell that wienie Alex he still owes me twenty bucks! \nROBBIE (looking back and waving as he walks away) Got it. \n18        EXT - MOMENTS LATER - CUSTOMER SERVICE KIOSK                   18 \nALEX and ROBBIE are walking to RIVER COUNTRY and walk past JAFFA in the CUSTOMER SERVICE KIOSK. \nPage 26 of 81 \nJAFFA (calling out) Alex! \nThey turn and walk over. \nALEX Jama...I mean...Jaffa the Jamaican...what shakes, it mon? \nJAFFA Jus' the same old this's and that's, mon. \nALEX Jaffa, meet Robbie Zirpollo. (to ROBBIE) Jaffa plays the tunes and talks the talk. \nThe PHONE RINGS, and Jaffa turns to answer. \nJAFFA (into phone) What? No way. (hangs up phone, to ALEX & ROBBIE) Check it out... \nJAFFA smiles and picks up a radio. \nJAFFA (CONT'D) (into radio) Attention Lost River guards. We have a report that some huge fat bald guy has abandoned his swimsuit and is slidin' down Lost River with nothin' on but a smile. Be watchin' for a great white whale now. \n19        EXT - DAY - TOP OF LOST RIVER RIDE                             19 \nWE SEE two female life guards, both with a surprised look on their faces. One has just reached into the water and picks it up to display a HUGE pair of swim trunks. Both girls make an Eeeew face. \n20        EXT - DAY - CUSTOMER SERVICE KIOSK                             20 \nJAFFA (on PA system now, into mike) Attention please. Will Mr. John Big Bootay report to Lost River Splashdown. John Big-Bootay to Lost River Splashdown. \nALEX (to ROBBIE) He's calling for security. \nALEX wanders off a moment, looking at something going on in the distance. \nPage 27 of 81 \nROBBIE (to JAFFA) Wow. Jamaica. I thought I was far from home. \nJAFFA (dropping the accent a bit) I'll let you in on a little secret. Perception is everything...now, Jamal from Aurora, he's probably over with those guys... \nWE SEE SKEETER and SNITCH walking into the men's room, looking suspiciously around. \nJAFFA (CONT'D) (back to the accent) ...cleaning the rest rooms. But Jaffa from Jamaica, he's in customer service, wearin' the nice shirt and playing the music. Perception and atmosphere. You get it? \nROBBIE smiles and nods, and waves goodbye to catch up with ALEX. \n21        INT - MOMENTS LATER - IN MEN'S CHANGING/REST ROOM              21 \nSNITCH is filling up a water balloon, while SKEETER is tying a piece of fishing line to the hook on the inside of the stall door. SKEETER climbs up on top of the stall. \nSNITCH is tying off the water balloon and grabs the other end of the fishing line, and ties it to the fill end of the balloon. He shuts the stall door, tosses the balloon up to SKEETER, who places it strategically on the beam above the toilet. SKEETER then jumps down, and they head for the door. \nEddie Enters. We see EDDIE cautiously checking out the restroom. He reaches up over the closed stall door and feels gingerly the fishing line. He smiles and shakes his head, and heads for the door. \n22        EXT -MOMENTS LATER - APPROACHING MEN'S CHANGING/REST ROOM      22 \nEDDIE is now pushing his cart and making his way toward the MEN's RESTROOM. He stops to talk to two concessions girls and show them a magic trick that apparently involves a deck of cards, which he pulls from a place on his cart. We see him holding the cards so one girl can pick one. \nAMY Well, anyway, Big Mike's is where they are. \nROBBIE Thanks. \nALEX and ROBBIE walk off. \nAMY What a couple of losers. \nKATIE I don't know...I thought Robbie was kind of cute... \nAMY Listen, you're new, so let me tell you how things are. First those guys were wearing blue shorts. That means \nPage 30 of 81 \nconcessions. (uses her fingers to explain) The Water World social structure is organized on three levels. At the bottom are the Trash Rats. \nKATIE Trash rats? \nAMY Bottom feeders. Grounds kids. Babies. They clean the toilets and empty the trash. Most are only 14 years old. It's the only job younger kids can do here. Next up is concessions. They're our \"middle class\". We don't hang with them and they don't much hang with us. At the top of heap are the guards. You are a guard. Girl, if you want to go out with someone, stick with your own kind. \nKATIE (looking off at ROBBIE and ALEX walking away) Aw, that's just silly. I think he's cute. \n25        EXT -DAY   BOTTOM OF RIVER COUNTRY ON THE WAY TO BIG MIKE'S 25 \nThis in an area where riders splash down from riding a tube down the River Country slides. ROBBIE and ALEX are walking past the splashdown area. \nROBBIE What did that girl Amy mean? \nALEX About what? \nROBBIE When she said, when are you going to tell him? \nALEX I'll tell you over a hamburger at Big Mike's. \nROBBIE and ALEX proceed to BIG MIKE's out of frame. \nSUDDENLY in the background we see a tube splashdown from a slide and the 7 year-old girl riding in it falls out. \nRealizing she is no longer safely in a tube she screams and begins splashing as if drowning. A guard nearby blows a single tweet of her whistle. \nIN SLOW MOTION we see four other guards throughout the area turn and react to the whistle. They begin running, BAYWATCH style towards the scene. \nPage 31 of 81 \nTwo guards are running and carrying a backboard. They converge in another BAYWATCH style slow-mo shot and line up along the edge of the splashdown pool. \nOne guard in the middle has a rescue tube, and, still in slow motion, squats down slowly as if to jump in and rescue the girl. \nAt the low end of the jump crouch, however he stops.      WE SEE his face in close-up as he says. \nRESCUE GUARD (slow-motion, voice distorted, to the girl) Staaaannnd Uuuuuuuupppp! \nThe drowning girl stops splashing wildly, and realizes she can indeed stand up. She looks at all the guards lined up, smiles sheepishly, and walks out of the pool. \n26        EXT - MOMENTS LATER - BIG MIKE'S                               26 \nALEX is standing outside of BIG MIKE's.    ROBBIE is walking out of the restaurant. \nROBBIE (Shaking his head) Aokee's not going to be happy. Nobody seems to know where these things are... \nALEX (smiling) Yep. (now laughing) \nROBBIE What? \nHe keeps cleaning. \nALEX (to ROBBIE) That stand is to display the coveted Surfer King trophy. Aokee seems to think that one day some concessions kid with more courage than brains is going to beat the lifeguards in the annual Employee Olympics. \nROBBIE And what would this concessions kid have to do? \nALEX Nothing, really. Just out surf the strongest guard of them all in the surfing competition. No big deal. \nROBBIE Has it ever happened? \nALEX A guard always wins the surf competition. Know why? \nTOGETHER (ROBBIE and ALEX) Because concessions kids can't swim! \nAOKEE (still cleaning) Someday. \nThey go back into AOKEE'S SURF AND SNACK SHACK. \n30        INT MOMENTS LATER -DAY- AOKEE'S SURF AND SNACK SHACK           30 \nROBBIE is now behind the counter making smoothies.      He puts \nPage 34 of 81 \nthem up and the two kids waiting take them and walk away. \nIn walk AMY and KATIE. \nKATIE (to ROBBIE) Hi there. \nROBBIE (blinking, smiling) Hello. On break? \nKATIE Yeah.   Two Blue Crushes please. \nROBBIE Coming up. \nHe shakes a mix container, blends it for about 5 seconds and pours it out into two cups. He then puts in two umbrellas with pineapple. \nAMY Oooh. Umbrellas.       I've never gotten umbrellas before. \nROBBIE These are only for VIP guests. \nAMY looks over to KATIE and rolls her eyes. \nALEX arrives at this point, and decides to provide a distraction. \nALEX Amy. Have you ever seen the fabulous Cummings and Robbins 2000-B? \nAMY (shaking her head) I don't think so. \nAs he leads her back into the kitchen... \nALEX It's incredible.      It washes 2000 plates an hour.... \nKATIE (to ROBBIE) So... you're not from around here, huh? \nROBBIE California. I just moved here at the beginning of the summer. \nKATIE I'll bet California's nice.      I've never been west of the mountains. \nPage 35 of 81 \nROBBIE You'd love the ocean. And the sunsets are incredible. You can almost hear the sizzle as the sun drops into the ocean... (daydreaming a bit) Of course, we all know it doesn't drop into the ocean. \n(shaking his head) You're not gonna believe it... \nAOKEE Listen. Some guy came in today and try to buy a sandwich and pay with a phone card. Today I believe anything. \nALEX I took Robbie to The Wave today. \nAOKEE (looking around) What? He drown? \nALEX No. It turns out that he's from Oceanside. California. You know, where they always hold those surf competitions? \nAOKEE Yeah.   So? \nALEX It turns out that he placed second in the state high school finals for the shortboard competition. As a Sophomore. \nAOKEE Robbie. (laughing in disbelief, dismissive, then serious) Robbie barely walk without help. \nALEX I saw it myself.      You wouldn't believe it. \nWe hear a loud CRASH from the kitchen.      AOKEE winces and gestures toward the kitchen. \nAOKEE I don' believe it.      Our Robbie? \nALEX Our Robbie. \nAOKEE (thinking) If this true....this could be da year. \nALEX That's what I was thinking. \nAOKEE Well, go get him. We need to make ready. He not just walk in and win this thing. \nALEX You heard it. He's in the kitchen... \nPage 38 of 81 \nALEX goes into the back. AOKEE sits at a table. Robbie comes out of the kitchen wearing a dishwasher apron. \nAOKEE Robbie, sit down. Alex, make up a Volcano. This boy in training. \nROBBIE (sitting down, worried) What did I spill now? \nWE HEAR the whine of a blender as ALEX is working on the Volcano Smoothie. \nAOKEE Robbie, Alex tell me you are some kind of surfer. This true? \nROBBIE I dunno. Yeah, surfing is usually how I spend my summers. \nAOKEE You know about Employee Olympics? \nROBBIE Yeah.   Some kind of trophy. \nAOKEE Surfer King trophy. Very big.     Very nice. (looking down) Concessions never win. \nALEX arrives with the Volcano Smoothie. He turns a chair around and sits. They will gang up on him. \nROBBIE I dunno...seems kind of silly to me. \nALEX It's a big deal. Every girl     wants to date you. Every guy wants to BE      you. Special privileges...we all     wear standard uniforms.   The Surfer King     gets to be creative. You ever see the      cowboy hat Cowboy wears? \nROBBIE It shouldn't be that hard...how good could this Cowboy be? \nAOKEE He very good. His family go to Hawaii every year, two, three weeks. Good surfer. If you do this, you need to see Pipeman. \nROBBIE \nALEX There'll still be time for fun. Most of the work is setting up. Besides, we get paid, too. When was the last time you got paid to party? \nWith that, ALEX punches in, as if to punctuate the line. \n36        EXT - NIGHT -   OUTSIDE AOKEE'S SURF & SNACK SHACK             36 \nIt is dark, but the place is lit up by little lights everywhere, Christmas lights in the fake palm trees, TIKI lights around AOKEE's, and lights lighting a stage where a band is playing, what else, surf music. \nBuffet tables line the area, and there is SMOOTHIE BAR set up. BIG MIKE himself is behind the bar making smoothies, while RICHARD is playing bass in the band. AOKEE is running around making sure all the buffet items are full. Everyone is wearing Leis, but the cheap plastic ones, except AOKEE and his staff, who have real ones flown in from Hawaii. \nAOKEE (pouring out four smoothies to ROBBIE and ALEX) OK. You work hard, and we fine now. Your time to party. Here they are. Special Love Smoothies. Be careful! \nALEX (to ROBBIE) These never fail. \nALEX picks up two Leis from a box behind the counter. He and Robbie walk over to AMY and KATIE who are standing over near the buffet. \nALEX (CONT'D) (to ROBBIE, but if front of AMY and Katie) Now this will never do. \nROBBIE (agreeing) I'm afraid you're right.     Something must \nPage 42 of 81 \nbe done. \nALEX and ROBBIE set the smoothies on a nearby table. They remove the cheap plastic Leis the girls are wearing. Then they put on the real ones they carried over. ALEX steps back to admire his work. \nALEX Oh, yes,    yes.... \nROBBIE Perfect.    A work of art. \nThe girls look at each other and smile. ALEX and ROBBIE grab the smoothies and hand two to the girls. AMY sips hers right away. \nAMY I don't remember anything like this on Aokee's menu. \nROBBIE They're.. \nALEX (interrupting) ..special smoothies. Fortunately, you know people on the inside. \nOnstage, the band had finished a tune before the dialog began above. Now JAFFA steps up to the mike. \nJAFFA We'd like thank Aokee and his crew for hosting this evening's Luau. \nEveryone applauds, AOKEE waves. Alex raises a hand and waves off the accolade. ROBBIE nods and smiles as the AMY and KATIE clap as well. \nJAFFA (CONT'D) We'd also like to bring Aokee up to sing one of his Hawaiian specialties. \nAgain, everyone claps and cheers him on.    AOKEE goes on stage. \nALEX You girls want to dance? \nKATIE (grabbing ROBBIE's hand and leading out to the dance floor) Sure. \nAMY shrugs yes and goes out with ALEX. \nAOKEE (onstage) \nPage 43 of 81 \nMahalo and Aloha. This song is sung on my island for all young people in love...or about to be. Is called E O'Mai, or, You Are Mine. \nAOKEE begins singing the Hawaiian love song, \"E O'Mai\".      Many couples are dancing; it is a slow song. \nALEX, of course, is a goof. He dances slow, but every once in a while executes a deep dip, much to AMY's terror. \n47        EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - BIG MIKE'S - SURF MUSIC BED 47 \nWe are at the back door to Big Mike's. ALEX knocks, and the same kid as before, DAVE, pops his head out. ALEX appears to ask a question, DAVE goes back in as ALEX waits. DAVE comes out again and gestures, \"no one knows\". ALEX starts to leave, but turns back and asks something else. DAVE disappears and comes back with a burger. ALEX shrugs, and walks away unwrapping and eating the burger. \n48        EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - BACK OF SOME BUILDING           48 \nROBBIE sees a door marked, \"EMPLOYEES ONLY\". He looks down at his employee ID and shrugs and goes in. As he enters we see he is pushed out by some unknown force. Out the open door comes \"Wally\" the Water World mascot, who walks off. Robbie has been knocked to the ground and looks up, shaking his head. He gets up and walks off. \n49        EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - BACK OF SOME BUILDING - SURF49 MUSIC BED \nNow it is ALEX who has separately come upon the same door, not knowing ROBBIE has already been there. He enters, and the door remains open. We hear girls screaming and he exits quickly, followed by a volley of thrown girl's underwear, swimsuits and towels. \n50        INT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - THUNDER BAY PUMPHOUSE - SURF50 MUSIC BED \nThis room is creepy. It is full of loud pumps and large pipes. ROBBIE is making his way through a labyrinth of piping and gauges and the like. He peers and sees a head with a red scarf, but it moves out of view.  Surf music fades. \nThere is a constant whine of the pumps. ROBBIE moves further in and finally comes across a man holding a large pipewrench, with his back to him. He is working to tame a small leak. \nROBBIE (quietly) Hello? \nNo reaction. \nROBBIE (CONT'D) (loudly this time) Hello? \nPage 50 of 81 \nThis startles and kind of angers PIPEMAN. \nPIPEMAN Hey.   You're not supposed to be in here. \nROBBIE Yeah, sorry. Are you Pipeman? \nPIPEMAN (recovering from the startle) Not on purpose. I guess some people call me Pipeman. 'Spose it's better than Carl. \nROBBIE So you're real name's Carl? \nPIPEMAN No. I just said Pipeman was a better name than Carl. \nROBBIE Oh. Well, my name's Robbie.      I work at Aokee's. \nPIPEMAN Oh. OK.   What the hell you doin' down here? \nROBBIE I need your help. \nPIPEMAN That scrubsink at Aokee's leakin' again? Gees, I knew we shoudda replaced... \nROBBIE It's not the scrub sink. I need your help. I'm competing in the Employee Olympics. With your advanced surfing experience, Aokee thought you might be able to help me. \nPIPEMAN (to himself) Everybody wants to be the Surfer King. (to ROBBIE) What advanced surfing experience? \nROBBIE Well, you know. \"Pipeman\"? Hawaii's North Shore? Surfing the pipeline? \nPIPEMAN Ohhh. Bad news, kid. I hate to disappoint you, but this is the reason they call me Pipeman. I'm the plumber around here. \nPIPEMAN holds up the large wrench. \nPage 51 of 81 \nROBBIE Oh, boy. See, I'm from California, and I can surf, I just don't know what to expect from the wave on Thunder Bay. I...I was just hoping you could help, I really am sorry for bothering you. \nROBBIE begins walking out, dejected.    PIPEMAN looks at him, and feels sorry for him. \nPIPEMAN Wait a minute, kid. I do know a little about surfing. I also know a lot about the wave here. What exactly are you looking for from me? \nROBBIE (tersely) Okay. Please. Tell me what I did wrong. \nPIPEMAN You're in the wrong position. The wave doesn't crest that soon. Move ten feet further away from the back wall. \nROBBIE (to himself) The ocean never had a back wall. (to Pipeman) Thank you. \nROBBIE paddles over to the spot suggested by PIPEMAN. AOKEE and ALEX are now sitting on the edge of the lawn chairs anxiously awaiting the next wave. It comes and ROBBIE catches it easily and begins riding it aggressively. He has a good run and kicks out at the end. \nAOKEE and ALEX high-five. \nALEX AND AOKEE (together) Yeee-haww. \nThey settle back into their chairs to absorb some sun. \n52        INT. DAY AOKEE'S SURF AND SNACK SHACK - DAY                    52 \nAOKEE is behind the counter finishing up making a smoothie. RICHARD, head lifeguard is on the other side; he will get the smoothie. \nRICHARD (grinning) So. I hear he's pretty good.     Haven't seen him myself yet. \nAOKEE (concerned, covering) Good? Good at what? Who you mean? \nPage 54 of 81 \nRICHARD Come on. Your ringer from California. Everyone says he's gonna give Cowboy a run for his money. \nAOKEE Robbie?    Robbie barely walk without help. \nWe hear a loud CRASH from the kitchen. \nRICHARD Gees! \nAOKEE Ha! \nAOKEE gestures back towards the kitchen. \nAOKEE (CONT'D) Your Surfer King. We just make a good show. Your boy have nothing to worry about. \nRICHARD You know I'd feel a lot better if you hadn't taken most of my money in that poker game last Friday night. \nAOKEE (dismissive) Poker? Not an island game.     I no good. \nRICHARD (nods) Right. Tell you what. Sight unseen even money, twenty dollars on Cowboy. \nAOKEE You want to bet with me? Take my twenty dollars, just like that? Humph. Not worth the trouble, twenty dollars. Now, maybe a hundred... \nRICHARD A hundred bucks... \nANOTHER CRASH from the kitchen, this time pots & pans. \nAOKEE (to kitchen) Robbie! \nRICHARD OK, a hundred bucks. \nThey slap hands to seal the deal.    RICHARD leaves, grinning and shaking his head. \nAOKEE (to kitchen) \nPage 55 of 81 \nRobbie?   That you?   Come out here. \nROBBIE (entering from kitchen) Sorry, dude, that tray was way off balance. \nHey, surfer boy! I got fifty bucks at three to one! Don't let me down, mon. \nROBBIE (to JAFFA) Hey Jaffa. NO worries. (to ALEX, shocked) People are betting on me? \nALEX Just a little friendly pool. No big deal. Helps make this more interesting. Concessions never had a chance before... \nROBBIE I've seen this Cowboy practice. His style is more longboard, and this is a shortboard wave, but he's still pretty good. I could lose you know. \nTwo concessions girls are walking by them. \nCONCESSIONS GIRLS (together) Hi Robbie! \nROBBIE How ya doin' (to Alex after they have gone by) See. How come everyone knows me by sight now? \nALEX Ah, you're the next big thing. You'll survive it. The Employee Olympics are only a week away. What happens is we have this big opening ceremony where each team chooses a theme and we're judged on our spirit. Then different teams compete in contests that test their Water World skills. The next morning it all ends with the surf contest. You ready? \nAnother group of concession girls calls ROBBIE from one of the snack bars. He waves. \nROBBIE I suppose. I've been working out a strategy to use if Cowboy has a real good day. It's risky... \nJust then they both nearly run headlong into TIFFANY. \nTIFFANY Well, hello Robbie. \nROBBIE (surprised) You know me? \nPage 58 of 81 \nTIFFANY Of course I know you. It's my father's park, I try get to know everyone. \nALEX (interrupting, eager) I'm Alex! \nTIFFANY Yes, I'm sure you are. (ignoring ALEX, back to Robbie) It's been a while since I've been to Aokee's. Do you suppose if I come down in a little while you could make some of that special chicken, what is it? \nROBBIE The best teriyaki east of the Pacific. \nTIFFANY Yes...and one those smoothies I hear so much about? \nROBBIE (stunned) Well, sure. I'll be working all afternoon. \nTIFFANY It's a date then.    See you later! \nShe walks off. ROBBIE just stands there. ALEX starts walking, then comes back. Finally ALEX pushes him on the shoulder. \nALEX Come on, we gotta get back. \nROBBIE (still shocked) Yes. Yes we do. \n56        INT. DAY AOKEE'S SURF AND SNACK SHACK                          56 \nAOKEE is wiping the counter alone.    HE turns toward the kitchen... \nAOKEE Alex! We need more large smoothie cups out here! \nAOKEE continues cleaning up. ALEX shows up with a load of cups, AOKEE takes them and starts placing then. \nAOKEE (CONT'D) (to ALEX) Look at that. \nWE SEE in a far corner of AOKEE's TIFFANY and ROBBIE in an \nPage 59 of 81 \nanimated, engaging conversation. \nLEAD MARCHER (CONT'D) Present Arms! \nPage 61 of 81 \nThe brooms come off their shoulders and are held forward. \nLEAD MARCHER (CONT'D) Company! \nMARCHERS Yes sir. \nLEAD MARCHER Order arms. \nThey begin a routine practiced with brooms, in a cadence, clapped by the grounds kids behind them. \nLEAD MARCHER (CONT'D) What do you do if it's wet and not yours? \nMARCHERS (in cadence) Don't touch it! Don't touch it! \nLEAD MARCHER How do you deal with a full can of trash? \nMARCHERS We empty!     We empty! \nLEAD MARCHER Sound off! \nMARCHERS Trash Rats! \nLEAD MARCHER Again! \nMARCHERS Trash Rats! \nLEAD MARCHER Sound off, Trash Rats. \nMARCHERS Trash rats! Trash Rats! \nThey stop.     Their brooms are raised over their heads. \nLEAD MARCHER Company!     Brooms Ho! \nThey allow their brooms to fall to their right side and march to the trash cans. They pull out bright blue ski masks, a la BLUE MAN GROUP, and pick up the toilet plungers. The lead marcher holds his plunger high and shouts. \nLEAD MARCHER (CONT'D) Company!     Begin! \nHe counts a four beat rhythm and they begin a BLUE MAN/STOMP like drum routine with the trash cans. \nPage 62 of 81 \nTwo grounds kids in regular grounds uniforms approach holding steel trash can lids by the handles (with gloves). These become drums as well as two of the drummers switch from trash can to can lids using the stick side of the toilet plunger as the drumstick. \nA competition erupts from the left and right sides of the line as they each set a beat and then the other matches. \nFinally, a show of unity as both sides join back into the beat for an ending flourish. \nThey pick up their brooms and turn their attention to the kids behind them. They begin to march in place and the seated grounds kids clap for the tempo. \nLEAD MARCHER (CONT'D) (to the seated GROUNDS KIDS) What do you do when the table's a mess? \nGROUNDS KIDS (together) We wipe it! We wipe it! \nLEAD MARCHER What do you do when a toilet's stopped up? \nGROUNDS KIDS We plunge it! We plunge it! \nLEAD MARCHER Sound off! \nThe guard takes the lead quickly, followed not far behind by the grounds kid. The concessions kid is working hard and splashing a lot but not getting very far. \nAs the guard reaches the back wall, he does an underwater racing turn and swims back toward the point where they started. Right behind him, the smaller grounds kid does the same thing. \nAs they are returning, they pass the concessions kid, who still is splashing a lot but not going fast. After they pass him he stops, as he is tired out. \nMomentarily he can't even tread water any more, and a guard watching from the sidelines jumps in and pulls him out. The swimming guard has beaten the grounds kid, the concessions kid never finishes. \n61        EXT LATER THAT DAY - SURF'S UP WAVE POOL SOUTH SIDE            61 \nThere are three lines set up with several participants. It is a relay race, with the baton replaced by a tray full of drinks in paper cups, water. The colors indicate again concessions, guards and grounds. \nThe race is already in full swing, with concessions in the lead. The last group of relayers are now getting their trays, and concessions is way ahead. \nPage 65 of 81 \nEveryone is cheering their team on. The final pass is made to SARAH who works for AOKEE's. She takes the tray and moves gracefully to the final stop. There is a small table on which the drinks must be placed. \nShe is clearly going to win when she suddenly stops. \nAll concessions kids are shocked and plead her to go on. \nShe does a nifty and graceful around the back maneuver with the tray, proceeds to the table, and sets down the drinks, tipping the tray sideways to show no water has been spilled. \nThe JUDGES scribble furiously. \n62        EXT. LATER THAT DAY - AOKEE'S SURF & SNACK SHACK               62 \nThree picnic tables are set up in front of AOKEE's. WE dolly past each one to see that they are cluttered indentically with what appears to be the leftovers from lunch for four. Behind each table is a team of two guards, concessions and grounds kids. \nA JUDGE blows a whistle and we begin by looking at the lifeguard team. \nIt is a boy and a girl and the girl is not too keen on this. They bring a trash can with them and begin gingerly clearing the table, acting as if they are afraid to get their hands dirty. \nWe dolly left to see the concessions team a little ahead of the guard team. \nWe dolly further left to reveal a grounds kid in a full rain suit with a face shield. \nA tremendous force of water is clearing the table into the trash can which the rain-suited grounds kid is holding at it's end. \nWe dolly further left to see EDDIE in full army fatigues with safety goggles on and wearing the biggest super-soaker water gun in the history of man. \nThe table is quickly cleared, and at the same time washed. EDDIE holds up the business end of the Super-Soaker gun and blows imaginary smoke from it's barrel, like an old Western gunfighter. \nThe JUDGES take notes. \n63        EXT. LATER THAT DAY - SURF'S UP WAVE POOL                      63 \nThe three different teams are gathered in groups waiting for the next challenge. One of each team is in full sweats, color coordinated by team. \nALEX is the one in the sweats for concessions. Slowly the sweats people walk into the pool about waist deep and lay \nPage 66 of 81 \ndown. \nThe grounds kid is the littlest guy of all. \nA JUDGE blows a whistle and four members of each team run into the water and drag their now soaked sweat suited teammate out of the water. They lie them down on a clear area and begin CPR. \nThe guards have a nifty little plastic device that lets them blow air into the mouth of their victim, and they roll him quickly on his side to clear water and back to begin CPR. They are fast and efficient, and clearly expertly trained. \nWe move left to see the grounds kids, knowledgeable but inexperienced. One girl is using her hands to provide a seals over the mouth of her \"victim\" and another is clumsily pumping his chest while the others try to keep a count while reading some kind of instruction card.. \nROBBIE (hypnotised) K... \nShe walks away. ROBBIE stands there a moment before waking up and leaving also. \n66        INT. EVENING - AOKEE'S SURF & SNACK SHACK                      66 \nIt is dark. We see ALEX and AOKEE cleaning up from the day's food service. ALEX Is wiping down the smoothie area, AOKEE is sweeping on the other side of the counter. \nALEX (voice somewhat hushed) I'm telling you we need to talk him. Something's going on. \nAOKEE (shaking his head no) Robbie know the right thing to do.     He's a good boy. \nALEX So how about this? He tells me I've got to cover for him if his mother calls. He told her he's spending the night at my house. \nAOKEE He say that? \nALEX Yes. Tiffany's got something up her sleeve and Robbie's too messed up to \nPage 69 of 81 \nnotice. \nAOKEE (reflective) Spending the night at your house.      This very bad. Very bad. \nAOKEE (CONT'D) He should be done with the dishes by now. Tell him we want to talk. \nALEX disappears back into the kitchen. AOKEE goes to an empty table under the one light on in the dining area and sits down. \nALEX comes back and ROBBIE follows. \nROBBIE Hey. I'm done with the pots and pans. It's almost nine. Can I take off now? \nAOKEE Robbie, please, sit. \nROBBIE sits down.   So does ALEX.   Robbie looks at both and gets suspicious. \nROBBIE Everything OK? \nAOKEE That's what we gonna ask you.    What you plan tonight? \nROBBIE Well, Tiffany invited me to a little party up in the mountains. \nAOKEE Robbie, you athlete. Big day tomorrow. You need sleep, not party. \nROBBIE It's no big deal.   I'll be fine. \nAOKEE Is big deal. Robbie. You good boy, smart, everybody like you, but.... \nROBBIE But... \nAOKEE Face it. Only one reason Tiffany interested in you. She want to make you so tired and so crazy you lose tomorrow. \nROBBIE (disbelief) Aw, come on... \nPage 70 of 81 \nALEX Robbie. She's still going out with Cowboy. I saw them together at the movies two nights ago. \nROBBIE Maybe she's just letting him down easy. \nALEX Robbie...things...things are not always what they seem to be. \nROBBIE Like what? \n", "test1_input": "They pick up their smoothies and walk off into the night. \n37        EXT MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT - NORTH EDGE OF THUNDER BAY          37 \nROBBIE is walking on the seawall that separates the bay from the sunning area, tightrope style. KATIE walks next to him. \nKATIE So...what made your folks pick up from beautiful southern California and move to Colorado? \nROBBIE Not both my folks.   Just my Mom. \nKATIE Aha...trouble in paradise? \nROBBIE Let's just say my father had an eye for his administrative assistant, and now they're both somewhere in Mexico. Mom got a job here, some of her family's here, so they said \"Colorady is the place you outta be\". \nKATIE It could be worse. \nROBBIE Well, I must admit, I've met some very nice people. (looking down and smiling) In California, the attitude's a little different. Here, not everyone is out to prove something. Seem's like everyone just wants to have fun. \nKATIE I have a theory. Sometimes it snows here so hard, that it's a challenge just to get to work or to school. Everything shuts down for a day or so. If your car gets stuck, people appear from nowhere to help pull you out and get you back on the road. Most people here don't just look out for themselves. A lot of times, \nPage 46 of 81 \nthey're looking out for you, too. \n38        EXT. MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT - CUSTOMER SERVICE KIOSK             38 \nALEX and AMY are inside the KIOSK.    ALEX is showing her how everything works. \nALEX All these switches feed sound throughout the park. Which reminds me. \nHe pulls out a CD and pops it into the CD Player and presses PLAY. He sees a flyswatter and begins waving it around like a sword. \nALEX (CONT'D) And this is for bad little girls who don't know how to have fun. \nHe begins swishing it around, AMY is giggling. \nALEX (CONT'D) Oops.   There....almost got you. \nAMY is dodging and laughing. ALEX closes in and seems like he will kiss her, but just starts gumming her neck, tickling her. AMY leans back laughing and WE SEE her back hits the volume knob on the amplifier. \n39        EXT. NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER GRAND PAVILION                       39 \nThey have reached   the area to the west of Thunder Bay. It is simply a concrete   pad that overlooks the party below. We hear \"Paradise is   in Your Eyes\" by Michael Peace, which begins with a lot   of jungle sound effects. \nKATIE (looking down at the party) You were right. This is nice. (reacting to the jungle noises) But not necessarily quieter. \nROBBIE Just a sec. \nHe walks away slightly and gets on the radio. \nROBBIE (CONT'D) Hey, Alex. Give us break down here. Turn down the sound effects. \n40        EXT. NIGHT - CUSTOMER SERVICE KIOSK                             40 \nALEX and AMY are kissing; she is up on the counter of the KIOSK. \nALEX (interrupting, but to AMY) Uh oh. Sorry. Hold that thought. \nPage 47 of 81 \nHe grabs the radio. \nALEX (CONT'D) (into the radio) I'm on it. \n", "test1_true": "41        EXT. NIGHT - GRAND PAVILION                                    41 \nROBBIE has set down the radio, and is walking back to KATIE now, who is swaying to the music. He doesn't get too close to her, and actually stands off to her left. \nSince she has the room and is momentarily inspired, she begins a few dance moves, ballet, and then ballroom style. \nROBBIE has seen this sort of thing before, and instinctively, almost without thinking steps in and becomes her dance partner. They proceed in a beautiful dance that almost seems rehearsed. Finally it occurs to them both. \nROBBIE (quizzically) So where did you learn to dance like this? \nKATIE (smiling) Eight years at Miss Vickie's Studio of Dance. What surprises me is you. \nROBBIE (somewhat embarrassed, keeps dancing) Can you keep my deepest, darkest secret? \nKATIE Of course. \nROBBIE (hesitantly) When you grow up within spitting distance of Hollywood, every mother seems to think her child is the next Harrison Ford. So when I was about 12, my Mom started taking me to all these auditions for things. \nKATIE So are you the next Harrison Ford? \nROBBIE Some days I'm not even the next Robbie Zirpollo. \nThey continue to dance.    After a few moments... \nPage 48 of 81 \nKATIE ....and? \nThey stop and walk over to the railing overlooking the party. \nROBBIE Turns out I get this part. They're selling some dish soap or something, and they think it will be magical to have two twelve year old kids dancing ballroom on this fantasy set with clouds and everything. They lock this girl and I into a dance studio with a choreographer for two weeks, and then they shoot the commercial. \nKATIE Doesn't sound so terrible.     You certainly learned how to dance. \nROBBIE Yeah, but when it came out everyone in school saw it. I couldn't go anywhere for six months without everyone in the room laughing their heads off. \nKATIE (touched, drawing closer) I'm not laughing. \nThey kiss, then return to dancing. \n42        EXT. MORNING - THE NEXT DAY - OUTSIDE AOKEE'S SURF & SNACK 42 SHACK - SURF MUSIC BED \nWE SEE ALEX and ROBBIE discussing something; forming a plan. They are going to look for Pipeman. ALEX gestures in one direction, and ROBBIE takes off. ALEX goes in another. \n43        EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - DAY     FIRST AID SHACK NEAR         43 FUNHOUSE - SURF MUSIC BED \nALEX walks up to the Guard, appears to ask a question.        The guard shakes his head \"no\". \nALEX walks off. \n44        EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - GIFT SHOP - SURF MUSIC BED           44 \nROBBIE is talking to a cashier in the store.     She shakes her head 'no'. Robbie walks out hurriedly. \n45        EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - CUSTOMER SERVICE KIOSK - SURF45 MUSIC BED \nALEX is talking to Jaffa. JAFFA gestures wildly, as if telling some big mythical story, but at the end throws up his hands as if to say, \"I don't know\". \nPage 49 of 81 \n46        EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - SOMEWHERE AT WATER WORLD -      46 SURF MUSIC BED \nWe are in pitch darkness. We hear the sound of heavy scraping metal. Lights shine and we are looking up through a manhole cover being removed. ROBBIE bends over the hole and hollers \"PIPEMAN\" and peers in. He shakes his head negatively and moves on. \n", "test1_id": 3201, "test2_input": "AOKEE (to Alex) Have you seen him? \nALEX Not yet. \nThey are looking to the north towards the crowd, but ROBBIE appears behind them. \nROBBIE (looking in the same direction) What you lookin' at? \nAOKEE We looking for you.        How you sleep? \nROBBIE I slept fine. (pause as AOKEE and ALEX wait) I decided I'm not my father. I don't run out on the people I care about just because some blond shakes her ta-ta's at me. \nAOKEE (relieved) We go then. \nROBBIE picks up his board, and they begin walking toward the bleachers. ALEX stops and turns suddenly. \nALEX She shook her ta-tas? No one said anything about shaking ta-tas. (reflectively) This puts a whole new light on things! \nHe is in ROBBIE's way.        ROBBIE pushes him with his board. \nROBBIE Get going! \n69        EXT. EARLY MORNING - THUNDER BAY                                  69 \nROBBIE, COWBOY and MELINDA from grounds, who we met earlier and was conned into the contest because she said she surfed once on vacation, are all standing in front of the JUDGES. \nOne JUDGE explains the rules. \nPage 73 of 81 \nHEAD JUDGE (looking down at clipboard) Alright, here's the deal. You get three tries; three heats. We judge each run and only your high score counts. If you fall you get no score for the run. Your score will be added to the total for your team, and the winner gets the Surfer King Trophy. Any questions? \nThey all shake their head no. \nHEAD JUDGE (CONT'D) Then let's begin. Grounds is up first. \nMELINDA grabs her board and begins paddling out. The wave comes and it's all she can do to stay on her board. She struggles and falls at the end. She will clearly not be a factor. The big screen shows a 0 in a column after the grounds score. \nWe look back to the bleachers to polite applause, but the COLONEL and the grounds kids are clearly disappointed. \nCOWBOY is out there now, the wave comes and he catches it easily. He rides the wave gracefully and well, and kicks out at the end. The big screen shows an 8 in the lifeguard row. The lifeguards and RICHARD are cheering now. \nROBBIE is next. He catches the wave and rides it more aggressively than COWBOY, but nearly falls at the end of his run. The big screen shows an 8. The concessions kids and AOKEE are very enthusiastic. They can see they have a chance with ROBBIE. PIPEMAN is watching from a far corner. \nMELINDA begins her second run. She is a little more confident this time, but still seems barely able to stand and ride the wave. More polite applause, and the big screen shows a 5. \nCOWBOY catches his wave, and tries to imitate ROBBIE'S more aggressive style, but falls midway through the run. We hear a large gasp from the crowd as this happens. \nThe crowd applauds politely, and the guards are supportive but disappointed. We see the JUDGES confer and the big screen shows a 0. \nROBBIE gets his wave, and surfs it aggressively again, this time not nearly falling at all. The JUDGES nod approvingly and confer. The big screen shows a 9. The crowd goes wild, especially the concessions kids. \nMelinda begins her final run. She does better than the past two, but not significantly. The JUDGES confer and the screen shows a 5. The ground kids are very disappointed, they know they are out of it now. THE COLONEL shakes MELINDA'S hand and thanks her for her efforts. \nPage 74 of 81 \nCOWBOY gets his wave, and has clearly decided to go back to his original style; he rides the wave gracefully, but takes no chances. \nHe kicks out at the end with a wave and a smile. The guards applaud, hoping to make it seem better than it was, and the JUDGES confer and the screen shows an 8. \nROBBIE snags his wave and rides it aggressively again, but loses his balance momentarily. It costs him; the JUDGES confer and the screen shows a 7. \nThe concessions kids applaud, and the point totals show \"Grounds   98\", \"Concessions 102\" and \"Lifeguards 102\". \n", "test2_true": "BIG MIKE (clearing his throat, flustered) It looks like we have a tie. This has never happened before, but I seem to remember we provided for this possibility in the rules. Hopefully our judges can help us figure out what to do! \nThe HEAD JUDGE is reading to the other JUDGES out loud, slaps his hand on one of the papers and comes up to the mike. \nHEAD JUDGE Reading from the rules, \"...in the event of a tie at the end of three heats in the surf competition, the teams who are tied will participate in a sudden-death surf off. Additional heats will be run until a winner can be declared.\" (looking up at the crowd) The \"Sudden Death\" heat will begin in five minutes. \nEverybody cheers...they're going to see some more great surfing. \nThe JUDGES signal COWBOY and ROBBIE to come over. The head JUDGE takes a quarter out of his pocket and points to COWBOY to call it. It lands and the JUDGE looks at it. HE points to ROBBIE. \nHEAD JUDGE (CONT'D) You want to go first or second? \nROBBIE Second. \nHEAD JUDGE Be ready in five minutes. \n70        EXT -MOMENTS LATER - AOKEE'S SURF & SNACK SHACK                70 \nPage 75 of 81 \nROBBIE, ALEX, AOKEE and PIPEMAN have gathered in front of AOKEE's to strategize. \nAOKEE So what you do?   Wait for him to go crazy and fall? \nROBBIE Don't want to win with him falling. \nPIPEMAN You could always go out and do your very best, take a lot of chances and maybe win this thing on merit. \nALEX (dismissive) Don't be silly. That only works in the movies. \nROBBIE (shakes his head) Actually, that's exactly what I'm thinking. It's the reason we're in a tie. I've been too conservative. I've got to do everything I can, or just forget about it. It's all or nothing. (pause) We gotta pull the fin. \nAOKEE Pull da fin? \nPIPEMAN You think you can hold it? \nROBBIE (explaining) One time, these tourists from Japan on the beach at La Jolla offered me a hundred bucks to do a full spin at the top of the wave, and then slide down and cut back and do a full back flip. I pulled it off. A friend of mine had a tricks board with just a single fin and foot pockets. \nPIPEMAN We gotta pull the fin. What do we do about the foot pockets? \nROBBIE You got duct tape? \nPIPEMAN reaches into his tool belt and pulls out a roll. \nPIPEMAN What kind of plumber would I be if I didn't have duct tape? Water World \nPage 76 of 81 \nPlatinum!   Where do you want them? \nThey place the board on a table. ROBBIE pulls off two small pieces of tape and places them on the board. \nROBBIE Here and here. \nPIPEMAN gets his screw gun out of his tool belt and begins removing the two outer fins of the board. He then begins looping duct tap around the board to create two foot pockets. \nThis provides a background to the dialog below. \nAOKEE So, help me understand.      What you do now? \nROBBIE Pipeman is taking the extra fins off my board. I only need one to make a deep cut back. He is also putting some pockets to slip my feet into so when I flip upside down, I don't lose the board. \nALEX Flip upside down? \n", "test2_id": 3202, "test3_input": "ROBBIE A back flip. You guys see it on snowboarders here all the time, I'm sure. \nALEX Oh yeah, I'm sure I did that last winter. But not on purpose! Dude. You're either gonna win this thing or you're gonna die. \nAOKEE (quickly, eagerly) It would be better if you won. \nROBBIE Yeah, well, a tie is like kissing your sister. \nALEX (mock anger) You stay away from my sister. \nWe hear an air horn blast.      They are ready to start. \nPIPEMAN Ready! \nROBBIE (to PIPEMAN) I'll need the biggest wave you can give me... \nPIPEMAN (imitating Mr. Scott on Star \nPage 77 of 81 \nTrek) I'll give 'er all she's got, Cap'n! \nHe hands Robbie the board. ALEX heads back to the bleachers area, PIPEMAN goes to the pumphouse in back of Thunder Bay. \nAOKEE hangs back with ROBBIE and speaks to him alone. \nAOKEE (dropping his Hawaiian accent) Robbie. When you do this, do this mostly for Robbie Zirpollo. But do it just a little bit for Manny Ramirez, eh? \nAOKEE smiles and pats him on the back.    Robbie nods.    They head for the bay. \n71        EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - THUNDER BAY                       71 \nCOWBOY is in the water paddling out to get his wave. It comes and he has apparently decided to stay with what has gotten him this far; a conservative style that keeps him looking good without falling. His ride is similar to the last one, but even more graceful and lyrical and he gets a 9. \nALEX (to ROBBIE) Looks like he's waiting for you to make a mistake. You sure you know what you're doing? \nROBBIE I'm just making this up as I go along. \nALEX Works for me! Go get 'em. \nROBBIE appears on the seawall holding his board and looking out first at the bay, then at the crowd. His mom, CONNIE waves, and he smiles weakly. \nHE sees KATIE and she looks hopeful. She hasn't given up on him completely. He smiles at her and gets into the water. \nHe begins paddling. It seems to take forever for him to get out to the spot where he catches the wave, but he finally arrives. \nHe sits there for a moment, collecting himself, then raises his hand to signal he is ready. \nThe CONCESSIONS KIDS have started to chant, ROBBIE! ROBBIE! The guards are anxious, but even they can't help moving to the cadence of the chant. \nThe wave comes and he catches it quickly, and slips his feet into the duct tape pockets. He misses one pocket at first, then gets it in. \nHe rides it carefully and at the right moment slides up to \nPage 78 of 81 \nthe top and executes a full 360 degree turn out of the water. \nOn landing back on the downside of the wave, he slides down it quickly, and then turns around with a deep cut and heads straight into the wave. At the top he bounces and does a complete back flip in slow motion. \nWe see the crowd also in slow motion. AOKEE Is covering his eyes, he can't watch. ALEX's face is contorted with disbelief. Various faces in the crowd are in open-mouthed disbelief. THE JUDGES are staring intently, focussed so as not to miss anything. \nROBBIE lands the flip, and rides the rest of the wave.      He waves to the crowd, and kicks off, exhausted. \n", "test3_true": "COWBOY knows he's in trouble. \nTHE JUDGES confer only momentarily and the score 10 appears, and the word concessions starts flashing along with the word winner. COWBOY nods in agreement. \nTIFFANY says something to him, and he appears angry.      We can only hear part of his response, something like: \nCOWBOY (disbelief) You did WHAT? \nAOKEE and ALEX lead him up to the grandstand. COWBOY also makes his way up there, and we see him talking to BIG MIKE. BIG MIKE nods in agreement and COWBOY goes to the mike as the crowd settles down. \nCOWBOY (CONT'D) As last year's Surfer King, it's my privilege to present this year's trophy to the most amazing surfer on the water today. Robbie! Congratulations. \nCOWBOY shakes ROBBIE's hand, and ROBBIE speaks at the mike. \nROBBIE (holding trophy) I just want to thank Aokee, Alex and Katie for all their support. \nWe see KATIE clapping, crying.   AOKEE and ALEX are clapping and smiling. \nROBBIE (CONT'D) And I have just one thing to say to everyone in concessions. WE DID IT! \nROBBIE holds the trophy high as everyone cheers. \nPage 79 of 81 \nFADE TO BLACK. \n72        EXT. EARLY EVENING SURFS WAVE POOL                              72 \nGrounds kids are stacking chairs in preparation for final closing. Tarps are being thrown over everything and tied down. \nAwnings are being taken down.     Chairs and tables are being moved. \nWe see JAFFA packing up his CD's into that cardboard box.       HE also snaps the winter covers for the sound equipment into place. \n73        EXT. MOMENTS LATER - EVENING TIME OUT SHACK                     73 \nA banner hangs over the time shack, \"Thanks for another great year\". ALEX, ROBBIE, KATIE and AMY are clocking out for the final time this summer. \nThey all stop and look around one final time.     Suddenly TIFFANY drives up in her convertible. \nTIFFANY Another summer gone. How about it Robbie? You gonna guard next year?      They could use your help. \nThey all walk closer to her car. \nROBBIE I don't know...we have a pretty good time at AOKEE's. \nTIFFANY You know, that's what I hear. Maybe I should work there next summer. \nALEX, ROBBIE, KATIE and AMY all say these lines pretty much at the same time. \nROBBIE You wouldn't like it... \nALEX That's a bad idea... \nKATIE And you're such a good guard... \nAMY You'd be miserable... \nTIFFANY Maybe you're right.    See you around... \nEDDIE appears out of the time shack wearing his tuxedo t shirt. \nPage 80 of 81 \n", "test3_id": 3203}

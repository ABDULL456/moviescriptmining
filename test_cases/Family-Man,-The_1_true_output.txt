A gleam in Jacks eye. 
JACK Thats right. And that would make us number one in our market... (getting up) You mind if I stand? 
A raised eyebrow from Mintz. 
Mintz and Lassiter follow Jack with their eyes as he crosses the room to the desk, pours himself a glass of water... 
JACK (CONTD) Look, I know our paltry little two million in sales is about what you spend on office supplies in a year.  And I know some regional trucking company account is nothing compared to a sixty billion dollar merger... 
ALAN Im not trying to knock the tire business, Jack. 
JACK (a confident chuckle) Its okay, Alan. I get it. Im in your shoes, Im thinking exactly the same thing...but heres the thing. Business is business.  Wall Street, Main Street, its all just a bunch of people getting up in the morning, trying to figure out how the hell theyre gonna send their kids to college.  Its just people... 
Jacks confidence is throwing Mintz off, but Lassiter appears intrigued... 
JACK (CONTD) And I know people. 
ALAN Im sure you do... 
LASSITER (intervening) Lets let the man have his say... 
Mintz covers his embarrassment with a smile... 
JACK (to Mintz) Take you, for instance... 
ALAN (defensive) What about me? 
JACK You drink about sixteen Diet Cokes a day. Youre an excellent father, but you feel guilty about the time you spend away from home. You drink bourbon, but you offer your clients scotch... 
Jack looks around the office then back to Mintz. 
JACK (CONTD) And your wife decorated this office... 
A laugh from Lassiter as Mintz sits there stewing, a caught look on his face. 
LASSITER He certainly has your number, Alan. 
JACK (turning to Lassiter) Youre a little tougher, Peter. 
A raised eyebrow from Lassiter, but hes game... 
JACK (CONTD) For one thing, you like expensive things. 
LASSITER (smiling proudly) Thats easy. Youve seen my car. 
JACK (a chuckle) Okay...you smoke Hoyo de Monterreys. Youre a scotch man, single malt, not because its trendy but because youve been doing it for forty years, and you stay with what works. You have two great loves in your life, your horses and this company. You wept openly the day the Dow hit ten thousand... 
Lassiters impressed. 
JACK (CONTD) And youre a man who prides himself on finding talent in unusual places... 
LASSITER Oh? And how would you know that? 
Jack smiles. 
JACK Because Im here. 
On Lassiter...nodding his head. Mintz, a plastered-on smile. 
JACK (CONTD) Im prepared to do anything it takes to get this job. Start anywhere you need me to start. Ill park cars if I to... (into Lassiters eyes) The biggest part of judging character is knowing yourself. And I know this, I can do this job. Give me a chance, Peter, I wont let you down. 
Lassiter returns Jacks gaze with equal intensity. In a moment, he turns to Mintz. 
LASSITER (to Mintz) Alan, why dont you show Jack around a bit... 
ALAN Id love to. 
CUT TO: 
100	INT. LASSITER BUILDING CORRIDOR - MINUTES LATER 
Jack and Alan walking side by side down the hallway... EMPLOYEES passing them by, greeting Mintz, Mintz waving back... 
ALAN (pointing) ...thats our war room. We did seven major deals last year, three of them hostile. 
JACK (not particularly impressed) Seven.  Really. 
They turn a corner, coming into a deserted section of the corridor. 
Mintz stops, turning to Jack.  Jack returns Mintzs gaze with a quizzical look. 
ALAN Lets cut the shit, huh Campbell? What, did you go through his wallet or something? 
Jacks a little taken aback. 
ALAN (CONTD) No matter. That circus act back there may have dazzled Lassiter momentarily but it doesnt do shit forme. Even if you get this job, which I highly doubt, let me warn you, Lassiter loses interest in his pet projects very quickly. Im in the big office because Ive proved myself to him year after year and nobody is going to come in here and start turning the old mans head. Especially not some tire salesman from New Jersey. So you watch yourself and stay away from Lassiter, and maybe, just maybe, Ill keep you on after he gets tired of you. Do we understand each other? 
Jack stands there, staring at Mintz, silent, expressionless. 
ALAN (CONTD) Do we?! 
Then, a broad smile from Jack. 
JACK God, you really are different, arent you... (nodding) I mean...wow...I am impressed. 
Now its Mintzs turn to look quizzical. 
JACK (CONTD) Good for you. Why shouldnt you protect whats yours. 
ALAN I dont think youre hearing me. 
JACK Oh, Im hearing you, Alan. Thats not the problem. The problem is that what you think is yours, is really mine.  And I dont care how low on the totem pole I start, I will get it back... (poking him in the chest) So do yourself a favor and dont get too attached to that view because sometime soon, maybe very soon, you and your French country antiques, your chintz sofa, and your little play pen are gonna be moving out of that office. 
Jack smiles at Alan one more time, then turns... 
JACK (CONTD) Oh, and by the way, you try selling tires for a living.  I promise you, youd starve. 
Jack heads down the corridor, whistling a happy tune, leaving Mintz standing there, bewildered.

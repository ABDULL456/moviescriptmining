LEDNOV (calling; echoing) Next time I won't miss. 
CLOSE SHOT

LEDNOV'S VOICE (echoing) Watch the one with the white face. 
Recklessly Clay raises his rifle and fires three shots at Lednov's position. 
EXT. ROCKS 
MED. FULL SHOT as Clay fires, Steve starts running down. He crosses the creek. 
EXT. LEDNOV'S POSITION 
LONG SHOT - DOWN. Lednov sees Steve running. He swings his rifle away from the horses and tries to get the boy in his sights. Clay fires again. A bullet smacks into the tree. Lednov flinches. Then again he tries to center on Steve.

MED. SHOT. Steve runs, bending low, toward the rail fence. A bullet kicks up dirt near him. 
EXT. LEDNOV'S POSITION 
LONG SHOT - DOWN. Steve has almost reached the fence. Lednov fires. Steve stumbles and goes down. 
MED. CLOSE 
Steve. He lies still a moment, then painfully he crawls to the rails and with a great effort tries to tear the rails down. Lednov fires. The bullet whistles past. Steve pulls the fence down, crawls away from the opening. The horses, milling around the corral break through. Steve lies still, face down. 
FULL SHOT 
The meadow, ANGLED PAST Clay. The horses scatter across the meadow. 
MED. SHOT 
Clay, now the hunter, moves toward Lednov's position. Lednov fires. Clay runs and jumps into the creek. Sheltered by the bank he makes his way up the creek. 
MED. CLOSE 
Lednov. He waits, his rifle ready. O.s. a twig snaps. Cautiously he looks ahead. There is silence. 
MED. SHOT 
his ANGLE. A light wind runs through the great trees. Shafts of light filter through the trees, making patterns on the forest floor. The light is dim, deceptive. Lednov, rifle ready, searches for some sign of Clay. Then from another direction comes the SOUND of movement. Lednov swings his rifle in that direction, waits. The SOUND has stopped. 
CLAY'S VOICE I'm here Lednov. 
His voice echoes across the hills. Lednov sights along his rifle at the direction from which the SOUND of Clay's voice came. Momentarily Clay is seen as he runs from one tree to another. Lednov fires. 
MED. CLOSE 
Clay. Clay cautiously edges around the base of a tree. He picks up a stick, stops. 
CLAY Come on out. 
His voice can be heard echoing across the hills. He tosses the stick. Lednov fires at the SOUND of the falling stick. 
LEDNOV'S VOICE Come and get me. 
As his voice echoes across the hills Clay quickly moves into the open and fires. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Lednov crumples forward as his echoing voice fades out. Clay moves over to him to stand looking down. 
DISSOLVE 
EXT. MEADOW 
MED. SHOT. Steve sits propped up against the fence rail. His shirt is off and his shoulder is crudely bandaged. Clay, who has been putting the bandage on, stands and takes a sack of tobacco from his pocket. 
CLAY (rolling cigarette) How's that? 
STEVE Kind of sore. 
CLAY You'll live. 
STEVE (shyly) Guess maybe I'm old enough to hold my own in a fight, huh? 
CLAY Yeah -- but don't make a habit of it. 
STEVE So -- maybe I'm old enough to tell you how to run your life? 
CLAY (stares down at him, then) I guess so -- but don't make a habit of it. 
STEVE Well, then, I know it takes three -- four weeks for you to come round to admit when you're wrong... But by that time she's liable to be in China... 
Clay looks at him for a moment, not angry, but not admitting he's wrong yet.

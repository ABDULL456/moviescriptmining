He's coming down the hall carrying a foil wrapped plastic plate and stops in front of his door.  It's riddled with locks.  He slips a small device out of his pocket, aims it at the door and the locks unlock, the bolts slide open.  He walks in and kicks the door shut behind him. 
INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                        53 
He slips on the light and crosses the front room. Deckard is a pack rat -- hard to tell if he just moved in or is just moving out. 
As he enters the kitchen, the SOUND of SOMEBODY BEHIND him causes him to whirl around fast, hand snapped out in front of him, gun already in it.  Rachael almost got shot.  But she's unruffled, a little pale maybe, but direct as ever.  There's a long, chilly moment, then she almost smiles as her eyes move to the plate on the floor. 
RACHAEL Was that your dinner? 
Deckard looks down at the over-turned plate and nods. 
RACHAEL I'm sorry.  I called and found out you were on your way home.  These were already delivered to your department but I thought you should have copies as soon as possible. 
She's holding out a cassette the size of a cigarette pack.  But it's taking Deckard's adrenalin time to recede. 
RACHAEL It's the Nexus information you wanted. 
He takes the cassette, but a man with so many locks must be wondering how they were gotten through so easily. He doesn't even want to ask. 
DECKARD Thanks. 
He realizes he's still got the gun aimed at her and sticks it back in his belt and they're left staring at each other.  The situation makes awkward silence. At least for him.  She's looking at him like she's got something to say but isn't saying it. 
DECKARD Is there anything else? 
RACHAEL I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help. 
DECKARD I've already got more help than I need. 
RACHAEL I think you need more help than you've got. 
He doesn't, but she's not backing off. 
RACHAEL There's two reasons a man rejects help.  Either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it. 
DECKARD Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no. 
RACHAEL Two of us might be more effective than one. 
DECKARD I work alone. 
She smiles. 
RACHAEL No you don't. 
She lets it sink in. 
RACHAEL You use your equipment, don't you? 
DECKARD So? 
RACHAEL So, I'm a piece of equipment. Use me. 
It's a strong look that passes between them -- a long one.  Maybe if he were on firmer ground he might do something about such an offer but... 
Deckard's eyes follow her down as Rachael bends to the floor and starts picking the food off the rug, put- ting it back on the plate. 
DECKARD That's okay, I'll get it... 
He bends down to help, but she's already done it. Their heads a few inches apart.  Something in her eyes diminishes the distance even more. 
RACHAEL Do I make you nervous? 
DECKARD Yeah. 
RACHAEL I'm sorry. 
And she is.  And suddenly he is too.  She hands him the plate and they stand.  She's looking at the floor, almost shy, then she looks up and he's watching her. She says it plain and simple. 
RACHAEL It's strange to suddenly realize that what you thought was your life is actually someone else's fabrication. 
Deckard nods.  He feels it, but doesn't know what to do about it. 
DECKARD I can imagine. 
RACHAEL Can you?  I couldn't.

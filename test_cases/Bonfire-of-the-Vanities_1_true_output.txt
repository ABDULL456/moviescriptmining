240   INT. STUDY - SHERMAN                                       240 goes to the closet and pulls out the shotgun. SHERMAN Here it is. POLLARD Sherman, we've known each other a long time. We went to Buckley together. My father knew your father. I speak as a friend. But also as president of the board. Is that a gun? SHERMAN I wonder if I can get both barrels into my mouth. That's what I was thinking. And how do you pull the trigger. I read somewhere about a man who took off his shoe and pulled the trigger with his toe. 
POLLARD Yes. This can't be a comfortable situation for you. (CONTINUED)

POLLARD Well... 
SHERMAN This is my home... POLLARD I understand that... SHERMAN This is the only safe place I have. People are threatening my life. I have to protect myself. He loads the gun and fills his pockets with shells. POLLARD There are people demonstrating in front of our building. Black people with basketballs! You're putting everyone at risk. It's not your fault. But that doesn't alter the facts. FOLLOW Sherman and Pollard OUT of the study TO... 
241   INT. LIVING ROOM - SHERMAN AND POLLARD                        241 SHERMAN Alter the facts?! The facts are that I have no place else to go! And you want me to move out?! Is that what you're saying, Pollard. You want me to move out of my home?! The guests begin to listen to this exchange. 
POLLARD You are a shareholder in a cooperative. Look, we're not asking you to do anything of a permanent nature... (CONTINUED) 
241   CONTINUED:                                                      241 SHERMAN Why don't you move out, Pollard? If you're so fucking terrified! POLLARD Sherman, please... 
SHERMAN And you can start by moving out of this apartment right now. Out! Now! 
Sherman points the gun at Pollard. POLLARD I came here in good faith. 
SHERMAN Oh, Pollard, you were a ridiculous fat blowhard at Buckley and you're a ridiculous fat blowhard now. Everyone watches as Sherman holds Pollard at gunpoint and steers him out of the room. POLLARD I will have to enforce the provision concerning unacceptable situations. SHERMAN Another word out of you, Pollard, and there's going to be an unacceptable situation right up                          * your ass! Now march!                                     * The guests applaud.    Sherman turns to face them. 
SHERMAN And that goes for the rest of you, too. Out. All of you. 
The guests look confused, they don't really believe him. Sherman aims the GUN at the ceiling. He FIRES. EXPLOSION. People scream.

PETER (V.O.) That same evening, just a few blocks away, I was being praised and congratulated. It should have been a very triumphant yours truly at Leicester's. But it wasn't. 
PULL BACK to include Peter surrounded by fawning packs of well-wishers, including Gerald Moore. PETER (V.O.) ... my little encounter with Sherman McCoy was spoiling everything. The truth has a way of doing that. (CONTINUED)

ODA MAE I want everybody out. 
ORTISHA Orlando? 
Ortisha looks around the room, befuddled. Clara and Louise aren't sure what to do. 
ODA MAE Now! 
Ortisha and her relatives scurry out fast. The ghosts, too, begin passing through the wall. Oda Mae lays her head on the table. Suddenly her whole body begins heaving. She is starting to cry. Sam is surprised. 
SAM Oda Mae, what's wrong? 
ODA MAE Out! I said out! That means you, too! 
Sam hesitates a moment and then respectfully follows the others through the wall.

INT. SEANCE ROOM - NIGHT 
Clara knocks on the seance room door and peeks in. 
CLARA Oda Mae, there's a man here who says he has to see you right away. 
ODA MAE I ain't seein' nobody. 
Willie pushes his way into the room. Clara isn't sure what to do. Oda Mae looks up. She does not know him. 
WILLIE Are you the one that can talk to the dead? 
ODA MAE I beg your pardon! I'm not seeing customers right now. 
WILLIE I said I need to know if you're the one. 
ODA MAE I'm the one. But not now. 
WILLIE This is important. I have a friend. He died recently. Some say he was mugged. I think he was murdered. 
Oda Mae stares at him curiously. 
WILLIE (continuing) I'm told you can contact people like that. Is that true? 
ODA MAE It's been known to happen. But it's not gonna happen now, so come back later. 
WILLIE I can't wait til later. 
He sits down across from Oda Mae and shows no signs of leaving. Oda Mae observes him quietly for a moment. 
ODA MAE What's your friend's name? 
WILLIE Good question. Why don't you tell me? 
Oda Mae glares at him. 
WILLIE (continuing) You're the psychic, right? 
ODA MAE This ain't no guessin' game. 
WILLIE Then what is it, lady? 
ODA MAE Lookit, I don't know what your trouble is... (getting nervous) Who are you? 
WILLIE You're the mindreader. I hear you've been tellin' people about me for days. What's my name? 
ANGLE - ODA MAE 
confused and uncomfortable. Sam comes wandering back into the room. His eyes bulge. 
SAM Willie! 
ODA MAE Willie!? 
Willie sits straight up in his chair, amazed. 
WILLIE How'd you know that? 
ODA MAE Because I'm psychic. 
With a sudden thrust, Oda Mae sends her foot shooting into Willie's balls. As he recoils she knocks the table into his lap and rushes for the closet. We see her barricade herself in the hidden chamber. 
Willie, shaking, scrambles to his feet and, before Sam can stop him, BLASTS his gun at the closet door. It is riddled with bullets. Sam screams out. Willie runs to the side door and escapes to the street. Clara and Louise come rushing in. 
Sam charges into the closet and sees that Oda Mae is safe behind the false door. Then he hurries to the street.

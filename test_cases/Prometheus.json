{"train": "PROMETHEUS \nWritten by \nJon Spaihts \nFADE IN: \nEXT. EARTH - DAY (12,000 B.C.) \nThe world turns below us, vast and slow. \nA RUMBLE. A shadow sweeps over the land. We move with the shadow. We cast the shadow. \nLandscapes slide by. Reduced by altitude to abstractions: river deltas, forests and flood plains. A raw natural world. No trace of civilization. \nThe shadow glides over mountains and glaciers. Across an ocean and a pale beach. Over lowland plain at the foot of a VOLCANIC MOUNTAIN it stops. \nEXT. LOWLAND PLAIN - DAY \nTHREE FIGURES walk out of the shadow. \nThey are men - and yet not men. Their skin is snow-white. Their features heavy and classical - as if Rodin's Thinker had risen from his seat. Their smooth heads are earless and hairless. Their glittering eyes entirely black. \nAgainst the stark land their height is impossible to judge. \nThey are ENGINEERS. \nTwo of them are cloaked in dark robes of strange design. \nThe third is naked. \nOne of the cloaked Engineers opens a featureless black box: inside lies a cake of dark, sticky material. \nThe naked one lifts the dark cake with ceremonial slowness. It hums and buzzes. Foams into iridescent spheres. He raises the seething cake to his mouth like the sacrament. \nBLACK SCARABS boil out of the dark material. Swarm over his lips. Glittering insects that chitter and bite. \nUnder the swarm his lips melt away. A horrific vision of teeth, black blood, dissolving bone. They are devouring him. \nFLASH ON: \nA fevered glimpse of the microscopic: cells rupture and bleed. Protein chains unfold. A DNA spiral unravels. \nThe scarabs fill their bellies with genetic material. \nTHE ENGINEER \n...spreads his arms. Stands cruciform, nearly headless. \nThe scarabs swarm his shoulders, his chest. When they reach his hips, he collapses sideways, toppling majestically like a felled tree. Engulfed. \nThe two cloaked Engineers watch impassively. \nBehind them, a vast black SHIP hangs in the sky. \nAs if blown by a great gust of wind, the scarabs disperse in their millions in all directions. Living DNA on the wing. Where the sacrificial victim fell, nothing remains. \nEXT. FOREST - DAY \nA pristine wilderness. The VOLCANIC MOUNTAIN in the distance. \nA PRIMITIVE WOMAN stands on a height, staring in amazement: far off a great dark ship hovers over the plain. \nA black scarab lands on the back of her neck. Bites deep. Injecting its cargo of DNA into her blood. \nFLASH ON: \nA microscopic invasion. Cells pierced and infused. DNA strands twining and mating. \nCLOSE ON THE WOMAN \nPupils dilating with shock, breath hissing into her lungs. \nShe slaps the back of her neck. Looks at her hand. The scarab lies in her palm. \nAs she watches, it crumbles to dust and blows away. \nFADE TO BLACK. \nON BLACK \nDrifting motes of light against the dark: a starscape. \nAn EXCAVATOR floats into view: a sturdy vehicle equipped with robotic arms. Bright floodlights beat at the darkness. Inside the cockpit - a bubble of glass - sits a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. \nThis is DR. JOCELYN WATTS, 32, a precocious scholar of many disciplines. A scientist accustomed to field work. \nThe cockpit is sweltering: she wears shorts, boots, a T-shirt - and still her arms and legs gleam with sweat. \nWatts works the controls. The excavator descends toward a rocky surface. Silt billows up as the excavator approaches: we're not in space at all, but deep underwater. \nThe excavator's thrusters are cowled propellers. The \"stars\" are plankton shining in the floodlights. \nINT. EXCAVATOR - CONTINUOUS \nA gleaming space station like a five-spoked wheel rotates grandly against the Pacific Ocean a thousand miles below. Black letters on the white metal read: WEYLAND'S WHEEL. \nA round shuttlecraft approaches the station. \nINT. SHUTTLECRAFT (ZERO GRAVITY) \nA spacecraft no bigger than a private jet. \nHolloway and Watts sit strapped into acceleration chairs. The only two passengers aboard. New to space travel, Watts tears her eyes from the spectacle of Earth outside the window. \nHolloway plays with a pen, batting it from hand to hand in the zero gravity. \nWATTS What's first? You do climate, I do genetics? \nHOLLOWAY Archaeology first. Let our ancestors tell the tale. \nWATTS You think he's serious? \nHOLLOWAY Serious enough to send his private shuttle. \nWATTS Weyland can send his shuttle out for pizza. (DELICATELY) (MORE) \nWATTS (CONT'D) Martin. If this meeting goes like the others, maybe we should... \nHOLLOWAY It won't go like the others. \nWATTS How do you know? \nHolloway plucks the pen from the air. He points out the window, where the crescent Moon shines like a toothy grin. \nHOLLOWAY Heaven smiles on our enterprise. \nEXT. WEYLAND'S WHEEL \nThe shuttle docks with the Wheel's hub - a perfect fit. \nINT. WEYLAND'S WHEEL - SPOKE ELEVATOR (ZERO GRAVITY) \nA gleaming capsule elevator with windows to the stars. \nHolloway and Watts float weightlessly inside, moving from handhold to handhold. The door closes. \nWatts grabs Holloway by the collar. Pulls them roughly together. They kiss. Not for the first time. They have a way. \nWatts's hair and clothing float free: she's a naiad in Holloway's arms. \nEXT. WEYLAND'S WHEEL \nThe elevator descends along the spoke to the rim. \nINT. WEYLAND'S WHEEL - RIM - FOYER \nA luxurious lobby. Tasteful lighting. Eames-era furniture in wood and chrome: the past's vision of the future. \nAt the rim, the Wheel's rotation supplies gravity. An elevator door opens. Watts and Holloway step out - Holloway with a sleek metal folio slung over his shoulder. \nThe floor is the outer surface of the Wheel: in both directions it curves upward out of sight. \nThe walls are all windows: on one side, Earth rotates lazily. On the other, a wheeling field of stars. \nDAVID, an android, stands waiting for them. He's cunningly built, but no one would mistake him for a real human being. \nDAVID Professor Holloway. Dr. Watts. My name is DAVID. \nWATTS Hello, DAVID. \nDAVID Mr. Weyland's eager to meet you. \nHe strides off across the foyer. Watts and Holloway exchange a wondering glance and follow. \nEXHIBIT HALL \nDAVID leads past models of planets, moons and asteroids. Holographic labels and data swirl around them. \nDAVID These are all the planetary bodies on which Weyland Industries has mining claims. \nThe end of the hall is dominated by a huge globe of Mars. Markings indicate widespread surface activity. \nDAVID (CONT'D) And Mars. Weyland's crown jewel. \nHOLLOWAY How is that going? The terraforming. \nWATTS They say you're getting diminishing returns. It's not working. \nDAVID It's the greatest engineering project ever attempted. Challenges are inevitable. Mr. Weyland's a determined man. \nWEYLAND'S OFFICE \nPETER WEYLAND sits behind a mahogany desk. He's a Warren Buffet type: a country sage, horse-sense and hard knocks. He might be seventy years old, or a hundred and seventy. \nBehind him stands DIRECTOR LYDIA VICKERS, a slim woman of 45 in a costly business suit. Shrewd and watchful. Once a great beauty, she now trades in ruthlessness. \nDAVID stands against the wall. \nWatts and Holloway settle into chairs in front of Weyland - Holloway holding the metal folio. \nWeyland jabs a finger at her like she's won a carnival prize. \nWEYLAND That's what I'm talking about. You left out my favorite part. The piece about Earth. DAVID. \nDAVID For eons, Earth's climate swung from hothouse to ice age. Explosions of life, then mass extinctions. But twelve thousand years ago the swings stopped. The Holocene Epoch began - a period of anomalous tranquility. The rise of civilization began only then. \nHolloway and Watts stare at DAVID with new appreciation. \nHOLLOWAY That's right. \nWATTS And that change coincides with a visit by the Engineers. They didn't just change us. They changed our world. \nWEYLAND That's the piece I mean. Engineering Earth. God stuff. \nHe swivels back to his desk. Rummages in a drawer. \nWEYLAND (CONT'D) My people checked your science. They say it's solid. \nHe pulls a thick contract out. Drops it in front of Holloway. \nWEYLAND (CONT'D) I'll give you your expedition. Ship and crew, supplies, support. One condition. \nHolloway picks up the contract with the cautious joy of a man double-checking a lottery ticket. His voice is husky: \nHOLLOWAY What's that? \nWEYLAND You get the discovery. Control of the site. But any technology you find? Anything at all. That's mine. \nHolloway reaches out slowly and picks up the contract. Riffles the pages of small-print legalese. \nWEYLAND (CONT'D) You take DAVID with you. My eyes and ears. And Vickers...you're going too. \nVickers stares at Weyland in shock. \nWHITE LANDSCAPE \nA glittering formation of white crystals. Diamond on diamond. \nThe structures grow more complex as the view widens. Leaves and branches of crystal. A shimmering field of white jewels. \nA landscape of white crystals, smooth as snow. \nEXT. DEEP SPACE \nA black void shot with stars, far from any sun. \nA sturdy prospecting ship forges through space, travel-worn but built to last. It carries the Weyland Industries logo. The name painted on its hull is MAGELLAN. \nINT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE \nThe ship's nerve center and control room. Six control stations, empty and quiet. Interior lights dimmed to blue. \nThe entire forward bulkhead of the Bridge is a window: wall to wall, floor to ceiling. \nAt the window stands the android DAVID. \nHe gazes at the cosmos with an expression of utter serenity. After a long moment he turns away. Massive shutters close over the window as he walks off. \nCORRIDOR \nDAVID walks the ship's long central corridor. The ship is silent. The lights dimmed to blue. He is alone. \nHYPERSLEEP COMPARTMENT \nA long steel room containing a dozen plexiglass sarcophagi, six on each side. Sleep freezers. Inside each freezer: the shadowy shape of a human body rimed with frost. \nDAVID walks through the compartment, surveying the sleepers. \nWORKROOM \nDAVID sits at a display table, moving intricate technical documents across the surface with waves of his hands. \nHis eyes intent on his work. If he is reading, then he`s reading at a speed no human could match. \nWHITE LANDSCAPE \nWe pull away from the frosted crystalline horizon, the smooth white curves like snowy fields. Form becomes clear. \nIt's the body of a woman. It's Watts. \nINT. HYPERSLEEP FREEZER \nWatts lies asleep in her underwear in a plexiglass freezer. Pale. Frost on her skin. Venus sculpted in ice. There are IV lines in her elbows and ankles. \nShapes move into view beyond her, outside the freezer. FACES. Pressed to the glass. \nHYPERSLEEP COMPARTMENT \nAll of the freezers are open and empty, save two. Holloway lies in one. In the next, Watts. Three men in blue coveralls crouch beside Watts's freezer, staring inside. \nThey are DOWNS, 30, a lean fidgety crewman. STILLWELL, 40, a sturdy fellow with the geniality of a labrador. And KAMAROV, 26, whose dark, brooding air belongs to a man twice his age. \nDOWNS Look at that. \nKamarov opens the lid of Watt's freezer. Leans over her. Watts stirs in her sleep, a drowsy angel. \nDAVID I trust your database is in order. I set it up myself. \nWATTS All's well, I think. \nDAVID turns to go. Hesitates in the doorway. \nDAVID I should tell you: the time you spent sleeping, I spent studying your research. \nHolloway and Watts look at the android, his words sinking in. \nWATTS You studied our work for two and a half years. \nDAVID It's quite a data set. \nHOLLOWAY So you've seen everything. Well. What do you think? \nDAVID glances over the documents displayed around the room. \nDAVID Your hypothesis is...bold. The audacity of it. Your climate data's undeniable: the Holocene Epoch was engineered. Dr. Watts, your genetic studies are equally conclusive. Pulses of cultural change are harder to prove, but even there your case is strong. I believe in your \"Engineers.\" \nBREAK ROOM \nA utilitarian sitting room. Steel benches and table bolted to the deck. Seated here are two Weyland Industries technicians: \nANDREW CHANCE, 50, a stocky computer engineer with a genial bearing and a bristling salt-and-pepper mustache. \nMONA RAVEL, 45, a dour, rangy woman with a plain face, her hair pulled severely back. A physicist and chemist. \nThey wear black Weyland Industries jackets. They radiate intelligence and competence. These are pros. \nDAVID leads Holloway and Watts past the break room. Holloway spots the technicians. Strides in to greet them. \nHOLLOWAY Weyland Industries! Mr. Chance. Ms. Ravel. You remember Dr. Watts. \nWatts and the technicians exchange greetings. \nHOLLOWAY (CONT'D) About the materials I gave you. Some of the technical aspects... \nCHANCE We'll handle our end of the job. \nRAVEL If there is a job. \nHolloway blinks at her. Chance explains, not unkindly: \nCHANCE We only have a job if you find something. \nCORRIDOR \nHolloway and Watts follow the imperturbable DAVID down a steel corridor to Vickers's cabin door. \nVICKERS'S SUITE \nAn open-plan cabin like an urban loft apartment. Watts and Holloway follow DAVID inside. Vickers rises to meet them. \nThe walls are industrial steel - but the floors are lushly carpeted, the furniture opulent. A king-sized bed, a mahogany desk, a dining table. \nGleaming machines ensure Vickers never need step outside: a private hypersleep freezer, an autokitchen, a medical pod. \nWATTS Is that a Pauling medical pod? There's only ten of those things on Earth! I guess nine, now. \nVICKERS I told Mr. Weyland I wouldn't compromise my standard of living. He accommodated me. \nHOLLOWAY I know, I had to cut my manifest. This used to be the number four cargo bay. \nVICKERS What can I do for you, Professor? \nHolloway gestures with the slate he's brought with him. \nHOLLOWAY We're about to reach the system periphery. I thought you'd want to see the search protocols we - \nVICKERS No. I was set to be the next CEO of Weyland Industries. Then you came along and sold Mr. Weyland on...this. So here I am. Out of the running. I'll go where I'm told. But don't ask me to play along. \nWATTS But when you get back... \nVICKERS I'll be five years behind the curve. Out of touch. Over. \nHOLLOWAY You might make the discovery of the ages. \nVickers looks at him as if she's dealing with a child. \nHOLLOWAY (CONT'D) You don't believe in what we're doing. \nVICKERS Mr. Weyland believes. That's enough. \nShe walks them toward the door. Interview's over. \nVICKERS (CONT'D) Now we're out of communication, you can tell the crew what we're doing. \nWATTS They don't know? They volunteered. \nVICKERS They volunteered blind. Classified job, triple pay. \nCARGO BAY \nThe crew - Brick, Glasse, Stillwell, Downs, and Kamarov - sit on crates in an improvised lecture hall. Holloway and Watts in front of them. Janek at the back of the room. \nHOLLOWAY Recording? \nFIFIELD No more. I'm out. \nHOLLOWAY Fifield. Get a grip. \nFIFIELD I'm a prospector. You find a load of bauxite, I'm your man. But not this. \nMILBURN I should go with him. Buddy system. \nHOLLOWAY (DISGUSTED) Fine. \nHe hauls a heavy rolling case out of the cargo rover. \nHOLLOWAY (CONT'D) You can deploy the drones. Drop them in the first or second nexus on your way back. \nFIFIELD Give us a rover. \nHOLLOWAY And half our gear? It's no more than a mile. You can walk it. \nSulking, Milburn takes the rolling case. The remaining explorers watch Fifield and Milburn backtrack into the dark. \nCORE CHAMBER DOOR \nHolloway and Watts lead their party up to a massive door, sealed tight. In design and scale, undeniably important. Holloway glances at his map. \nHOLLOWAY This should lead to the core of the pyramid. \nWATTS Jack it open? Or cut through? \nHOLLOWAY Let's do as little damage as we can. \nRavel waves a sensor over the wall. \nRAVEL There's power. Current flowing in the wall. \nChance begins to inspect the frame of the door. \nCHANCE Maybe we can hack it. Has to be a mechanism... \nDAVID looks as if they fail to see something obvious. He points at a spot on the wall beside the massive slab. \nDAVID Pull up a rover. I want to get up there. \nINT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE - DAY \nJanek stands at the window, looking down the long canal at the distant pyramid. \nThe ship's powerful imaging systems stream data: stereoscopic feeds from the explorers' flashlights; a map that grows as they explore. The maze under the pyramid drawn in light. \nA globe of LV-426 blooms with terrain and weather data as the satellites feed the ship information. \nVickers appears at Janek's side. \nJANEK Director. Taking an interest? \nVICKERS It's my operation, isn't it? \nINT. PYRAMID - HUB \nA junction where multiple passageways converge. \nMilburn and Fifield trudge into the space, trundling the probe cases behind them. Tunnels lead away in all directions. \nFIFIELD What do you think? \nMILBURN Grand Central Station. \nThey open the case. CAMERA PROBES tumble out: spheres the size of softballs, studded with lenses and sensors. \nTiny lights come on as the probes awaken. They roll off, dispersing to investigate every passageway. Bumbling into walls and pillars, reversing. Exploring by random walk. \nFIFIELD Let's check the feed. Gimme the map. \nMILBURN You had the map unit. \nFIFIELD You don't have the map? \nThey stare at each other. \nMILBURN Are you serious? \nHe trudges back the way they came, in disgust. \nMILBURN (CONT'D) Come on. \nCORE CHAMBER DOOR \nDAVID stands on top of one of the cargo rovers. He's cut a hole in the wall beside the door, high up: he works with probes in the mechanisms inside. \nDAVID Looks like a three-state switch. \nA deep BOOM, echoing inside the ancient walls. Nothing moves. \nDAVID (CONT'D) One moment... \nMilburn and Fifield are lost. They bumble through the dark. \nMILBURN This is not the same place. \nFIFIELD It is! That is the same freaky thing we saw before. \nHe points at a detail of the architecture. \nMILBURN No it's not! The other one was more... sort of...fuck it. (taps his comm) Milburn to Magellan. Come in. \nStatic. \nINTERSECTION \nHolloway and Watts round a corner and stop in their tracks. Kamarov, Stillwell, and Downs almost run into them. \nThe scientists stand frozen. \nIn front of them lies a dead giant. An ENGINEER. \nIf he were standing, he would be fifteen feet tall. \nHe is roughly human in shape. Barrel-chested. Withered to the bones. There are bulky protrusions fused with his flesh: hard to say whether they are equipment or parts of his body. \nHis head, lolling to one side, is severed from his body. \nHis eyes seem to be covered by goggles; but if so then the goggles are fused with his skull. An elephantine proboscis, severed now, once connected to a protrusion on his hip. \nThe giant lies frozen in a convulsion of agony. His jaw gaping in a silent scream. His corpse is marred by hideous wounds: slashes that cut through bone. \nThe explorers move closer. Speechless. \nKAMAROV God in Heaven. \nWATTS Martin. Martin. \nHOLLOWAY I know. Look. \nHe lifts his light. Beyond the dead giant, a vision of Hell: \nA dozen DEAD ENGINEERS lie heaped against a sealed door. Twisted in postures of torment, murdered in the attempt to escape. All bear horrific wounds. \nScene of an ancient massacre. \nINT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE \nJanek and Vickers stare dumbstruck at a 3-D view of the dead giants captured by the explorers' cameras. \nINT. CATACOMB - INTERSECTION \nThe explorers circle the decapitated giant, hushed with awe. Holloway steps close. \nHOLLOWAY \"There were giants in the earth in those days...and when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, they bare children to them, who became mighty men.\" Genesis six four. \nLays a gloved hand reverently on the giant's ribs. \nDOWNS (PANICKY) You said don't touch anything! You said don't touch anything! \nHOLLOWAY Peace. \nCHANCE The size of them! \nHOLLOWAY In all the old mythologies, the visitors from the sky were giants. \nWatts joins Holloway beside the dead Engineer. Touches the corpse in her own turn. It's hard as stone: ossified. She traces the ancient, terrible wounds. \nWATTS They were killed. All of them. \nDowns stands staring at the dead giant, as shaken as Kamarov. \nDOWNS We shouldn't be here. \nHOLLOWAY Come on. The dead can't hurt you. (adjusts his communicator) DAVID. Chance. Ravel. I've got something here. \nStatic. \nWATTS Communications are going to hell. \nEXT. SPACE - LV-426 ORBIT \nOne of the Magellan's satellites hurtles along, high above the moon's atmosphere. It passes over the terminator line between the night side and day side. \nThrough the clouds below, a lightning-laced storm front rolls across LV-426 like a wave. \nINT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE - DUSK \nRising winds pluck at the ground cover outside the window. Janek turns from the view to look at the holographic globe. \nJANEK All hands. Back to the ship. We got a mean storm front rolling in. I repeat. All hands... \nINT. DARK CITY - CATACOMBS - INTERSECTION \nStanding beside the dead giant, Watts and Holloway look at each other as the signal comes in. \nJANEK (V.O.) (STATICKY) front rolling...back to the ship. \nMILBURN I hate these fucking things. \nINT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE - DUSK \nFIFIELD (V.O.) We hate these fucking , Captain. \nJANEK Maybe next time you'll mind your maps. Keep your heads down. We'll come get you in the morning. \nA burst of static answers him: Fifield's voice scrambled by the storm. Unintelligible. \nJANEK (CONT'D) Magellan out. \nMESS ROOM - NIGHT \nAll hands present excepting the two missing men. Janek plays his squeeze box, its archaic music filling the air. Tired and exuberant, the men sway and dance mockingly. \nHolloway has a champagne bottle open in each hand. He fills steel cups left and right. \nHOLLOWAY My friends. What we do here marks the greatest achievement of our species. Contact with another civilization. Humanity came of age today, on this moon. You were there. (raises his glass) To history. \nThey raise cups and drink. Even the crew moved by the moment. But Janek smiles crookedly and toasts again. \nJANEK To Milburn and Fifield. The first human beings to freak out, get lost, and sleep in their suits in the ruins of an alien civilization. \nINT. PYRAMID CATACOMBS - NIGHT \nA vast dark maze. Milburn and Fifield grope their way through the dark with flashlights. The storm howls outside. \nMILBURN What are you looking for? \nFIFIELD (groping along the wall) Someplace things can't come at us. \nMILBURN What's gonna come at us? \nINT. MAGELLAN - VICKERS'S SUITE - NIGHT \nDAVID stands beside Vickers at her holography terminal. He lays his hand on over a signal plate - and the terminal lights up with a three-dimensional image. \nThe core chamber of the pyramid, from DAVID's point of view. \nIt's apparent that DAVID's eyes see more than human eyes do. He seems to see heat and electromagnetic energy as well as visible light; calibrated readouts are overlaid on the scene. \nThe structures in the pyramid are surrounded by complicated patterns of energy. This is incomprehensible technology. \nDAVID The core of the pyramid. You see. \nVickers goes rigid, looking at it: avarice in her eyes. \nVICKERS We're going to protocol two. \nDAVID I understand. \nLABORATORY \nA high-tech science facility behind glass. Watts and Holloway, in lab gloves and smocks, open the dumbwaiter: \nAn ENGINEER'S HEAD rises into view, ghoulish and elephantine. Vapor rises from it. A readout blinks: STERILIZED. \nThey lift it onto the steel table. It takes both of them. \nThey pass scanners over the skull. Images accumulate and rotate on the laboratory displays. X-ray and ultrasound. \nHolloway leans close to study an X-ray image. He almost seems to see a ghostly second face... \nWATTS Martin. Look. \nShe traces the head with an ultrasound probe: under the vibrations a seam opens up around the edge of the face. \nShe gets a fingertip into the seam. Works with a probe. Pries away the long-dead Engineer's mask. It comes free. \nThe visage revealed is human, except for its giant scale. \nWhite-skinned. Earless. Hairless. Withered but beautiful as a Greek statue. Eyes closed. An expression of suffering on its face. Watts drops the ultrasound probe in shock. \nWATTS (CONT'D) They look like us. \nHOLLOWAY We look like them. Genesis 1:27. \"And God created man in his own image. In his own image created He him.\" \nVickers and DAVID stand outside the lab window, staring in at the god's head. Vickers looks shaken. DAVID, fascinated. \nWatts covers her nose in revulsion. A horrible stench: The Engineer head begins to disintegrate in front of them. Flesh oozing, skin peeling. Accelerated decay. \nHOLLOWAY (CONT'D) It's breaking down. \nWATTS Formaldehyde! \nUrgently they ransack cabinets and storage rooms. Watts finds a clear plastic drum and dumps its contents. Holloway drags five-gallon jugs of preservative out of a cabinet. \nDAVID watches through the window, almost amused. \nDAVID Mortal after all. \nThey lift the rotting head into the drum, retching. Fingers skidding in putrefaction. \nThey pour formaldehyde over it. As soon as the head is immersed they rush to strip off their reeking gloves and smocks, scrubbing their hands. \nWATTS Formaldehyde's killing the tissue. \nHolloway stares at Watts, awe on his face. \nHOLLOWAY Did you record that? \nWATTS Of course. \nAT A LAB TABLE \nWatts dissects one of the Engineer's eyes - working underwater in a shallow tub of preservative. Glasse looks on avidly, an unabashed fan. \nWatts wears a pair of magnifying goggles on her forehead - the lenses lowering and rising at need. \nShe bisects the apple-sized eyeball carefully and extracts the hard lens from behind the cornea. Holds the lens up to her eye. It is opalescent, almost luminous. \nWATTS (CONT'D) The lens is where the phase shift happens. \nThe uncorrected view through the lens is blurry. \nWATTS (CONT'D) Glasse. I want to look through these lenses. Can you seal them and do the optical correction? \nGlasse reaches out and plucks the magnifying goggles from Watts's forehead. He grins. \nGLASSE Got an idea about that. \nINT. CATACOMBS - INSECT CHAMBER \nMilburn writhes on the ground, heels drumming frantically against the deck. Excruciating screams. \nFifield kneels over him, helplessly pulling at the tail of the centipede - which has all but vanished into Milburn's suit. A trickle of scarlet from the hole. \nFifield is delirious with horror. He clutches at the centipede in vain. It slips through his gloves. \nMilburn claws at Fifield, wild-eyed. \nMILBURN Cut off my arm. Cut off my - \nHe convulses. Spits blood. The head of the centipede emerges between his teeth. He seizes. Choking and dying. \nFIFIELD Jesus Christ! \nHe leaps up. Backs away. Runs into the dark. \nINT. CATACOMBS - LONELY PASSAGE - NIGHT \nFifield stumbles along. Exhausted. Pouring sweat inside his suit. He is hopelessly lost. He slams into a resinous structure that topples to the floor. Things break. \nHe whips his light around in jittery paranoia. Taps at his comm controls, getting only static. \nIn Fifield's headlamp beam, the blackness is filling with motes of light. A blizzard of tiny flying insects. \nSCARABS. \nFIFIELD Fifield to Magellan. Come on, come on. Anybody, seriously! God damn it! \nScarabs flit through the darkness around him. They alight on his shoulders. Crawl over his visor. Obscuring his vision. \nFIFIELD (CONT'D) Get off! \nHe swats at his visor, killing some. The crushed insects produce acid that eats into the plexiglass in seconds. \nFIFIELD (CONT'D) Shit. \nHe twists, craning with his flashlight to inspect himself. Brushes scarabs away right and left. \nAcid opens a hole in his visor. Scarabs are inside. Buzzing around his head. Fifield freaks out, clawing at his helmet. \nA scarab bites his cheek. \nFLASH ON: \nThe microscopic world - as strange DNA invades Fifield's bloodstream. Virulent strands of protein attack the native DNA, transforming... \nFIFIELD \nAs his pupils dilate, breath hissing into his nostrils. His expanding body stiffens as if shocked by a powerful electric current. He screams. Falls, convulsing. \nEXT. MAGELLAN - NIGHT \nThe storm batters the ship, bouncing it on its suspension. \nSCIENTISTS' CABIN - NIGHT \nWatts and Holloway lie in bed, exhausted. Arms around each other. Watts stares into space. \nWATTS We found the gods. And they've been murdered. \nHOLLOWAY You've pried too many arrowheads out of old skulls to get squeamish now. They've been dead what, eighteen hundred years? Two thousand? \nWATTS What could kill them? \nHolloway contemplates the question. \nHOLLOWAY Who knows? (he laughs bitterly) (MORE) \nWATTS I'm human. \nDAVID That's what I mean. \nINT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE - DUSK \nJanek stands on the Bridge, looking out at the fading light. A towering wall of cloud rushes over the horizon. \nA storm front rolls across the holographic globe. \nINT. PYRAMID - LOWER PASSAGE \nDAVID and Watts keep searching. Their communicators crackle. \nJANEK (V.O.) (FILTERED) Watts. We've got another storm front coming in. Looks like it follows the sunset line. If you're coming in you'd better do it now. \nWATTS (ANGRILY) No. \nDAVID I see light. \nWatts squints into the darkness. She sees nothing. \nWATTS Janek, hang on... \nShe sees it. A dim light bobbing far ahead in the passageway. She runs forward - finds Holloway staggering blearily toward her, leaning on the wall. His helmet and most of his gear are missing; only his chest lamp shines. \nWATTS (CONT'D) We've got him! (TO HOLLOWAY) Martin! Where's your helmet? \nHe's disoriented: he stares at her face for a moment before she registers. His teeth chatter. He's freezing. \nHOLLOWAY Broken. I fell. Little...disoriented. I've just been... \nHe waves a hand vaguely at the tunnels behind him. \nDAVID removes his own helmet. Fits it over Holloway's head. \nDAVID Here. I can do without this. \nWATTS Let's get you home. \nEXT. MAGELLAN - AIRLOCK LIFT - DUSK \nDAVID - bareheaded in the winds - walks Watts and Holloway onto the airlock. \nDAVID looks over his shoulder at the canal leading back to the central crater. As the airlock lift begins to rise, he steps backward out into the storm. Turns and runs through the gale toward the pyramid. \nWatts watches him go in astonishment. \nINT. MAGELLAN - EXCURSION CHAMBER \nWatts helps Holloway out of his space suit. Janek looks on. \nJANEK I didn't think I'd see you again. You know we lost two men. \nHolloway still looks too weary to think straight. He nods. \nHOLLOWAY She told me. I'm sorry. \nHe stands abruptly, swaying a little. \nHOLLOWAY (CONT'D) I need to lie down. We'll size things up in the morning. Fair enough? \nJANEK Of course. \nPASSAGEWAY \nHolloway and Watts walk aft toward their cabin. Watts looks worried - but Holloway shows little of the weakness he just claimed to feel. \nWATTS What happened to you? \nHOLLOWAY (QUIETLY) Not here. \nSCIENTISTS' CABIN - WASHROOM - NIGHT \nHolloway stands shirtless in the tiny space, brushing his teeth. A red weal around his neck. \nWatts stands beside him, watching him in the mirror. \nHOLLOWAY Jocelyn. I saw something. God, my mouth tastes like an old boot. \nHe spits. Rinses. She touches the mark on his neck. \nWATTS What's this? \nHOLLOWAY Neck-ring of my suit, I think. Fell on it. \nHe rubs his neck, eyes far away. Watts watches him curiously. \nWATTS What did you see? \nHOLLOWAY After my fall, I woke up walking. Delirious. My helmet wasn't right. I took it off. I was in and out. I just wandered. I went up into a huge space like a cathedral. And I found a model of the galaxy. Floating in the air. \nWATTS Are you okay? You sound... \nHOLLOWAY This was real. My headset video is wherever my helmet is...but my suit tracker will show where I was. \nA horrible sound of breathing, ragged and wet. \nIn a corner, lit by a green glow from seams in the floor - \nA FIGURE IN A WHITE SPACE SUIT lies writhing weakly. \nThe insignia on the suit's chestplate reads FIFIELD. The suit's helmet is shattered. Inside the helmet, Fifield's head is a horror: a gelatinous mass, skin reduced to putty. \nThe softened bones of his skull change shape as we watch. Elongating. Fifield mews in pain. \nINT. MAGELLAN - CAPTAIN'S WARDROOM \nJanek keys open the arms locker in his wardroom. Unlocks automatic pistols from their rack one by one, and hands them to Stillwell and Kamarov. \nHYPERSLEEP COMPARTMENT \nHolloway's body lies frozen in his hypersleep freezer, blue with frost. The horrific wound yawning in his chest. \nWatts enters. Cleaned up. She opens the freezer. Her hand caresses Holloway's cold cheek tenderly. Slides over his collarbone - lies flat on his chest above his awful wound. \nGlasse enters. Reacts in dismay. Tries to pull her back. \nGLASSE You don't want to see that... \nShe turns on him fiercely. \nWATTS I want to understand. \nINT. MESS ROOM - DAWN \nThe entire complement of the ship gathers for an emergency meeting. Janek at the head of the hall. Glasse, Downs, Brick, Stillwell, and Kamarov seated with pistols on their hips. \nTo one side: Vickers with Captain Shepherd and Vigoda. \nJANEK All right! Listen up. I expect you all know what... \nWatts enters. They all stare at her, knowing what she's been through. With averted eyes she crosses the room. Sits alone. \nJANEK (CONT'D) We've got some kind of parasite aboard ship. \nVICKERS I suggest you kill it. \nDOWNS There's a bright idea. \nKAMAROV Show us where it is, lady. We just spent five hours looking for the damn thing. \nWATTS We found Engineers who died like Martin. \nSilence. They all turn to look at her. \nWATTS (CONT'D) Explosive wounds in the chest. Whatever killed Martin is the same thing that killed the Engineers a thousand years ago. \nSTILLWELL Jesus. \nWATTS But not all the Engineers died that way. The others were torn apart. Slashed to pieces. \nA murmur among the men as the implications of that sink in. Even Vickers is disconcerted. \nJANEK We're a modular ship. Self-contained life-support and power in every section. I say put the ship in orbit. Vent every compartment to space. Sit in vacuum at twenty degrees Kelvin for a week. Kill anything. \nDOWNS Then what? \nSTILLWELL Straight home, man. \nVICKERS This ship doesn't lift until our work's done. \nShe joins Janek at the head of the room. Shepherd and Vigoda flank her, rifles slung. The soldiers scan the room, meeting each man's eyes. The quiet threat is unmistakable. \nJANEK Are you serious? \nVICKERS We spent years and billions of dollars getting here. The technology we came for is in our hands. We just need a little more time. \nJANEK We're barely here three days and three men dead! \nVICKERS They were careless. \nJANEK Careless! \nAs the argument picks up heat, Watts slips out of the room. \nEXCURSION CHAMBER \nWatts, in a space suit, no helmet, opens Holloway's locker. \nShe pulls out the space suit he wore on the last day of his life. HOLLOWAY stenciled on the chest. Her fingers linger in its folds as if she could soak up some last trace of him. \nShe pulls the tracking chip from the chestplate of his suit. \nPlugs the chip into a map unit. The holographic map lights up. The legend in the corner reads MARTIN HOLLOWAY. \nA wandering path shows Holloway's final exploration. Markers on the map denote his photographs, field notes and scans. \nWatts touches a marker. One of Holloway's field notes plays: \nHOLLOWAY (V.O.) (FILTERED) Seven dead Engineers all facing the same way. Going where? Jocelyn's right, we don't see the big picture yet. Another level below me. I'm going down. \nA CLATTER behind her makes her spin: but it's only a spherical mapping probe, bumbling through the dark. \nShe walks on - \nHOLLOWAY (O.S.) (FILTERED) Jocelyn! \nThe voice transfixes her where she stands, a look of holy dread on her face. Shivering, she prowls toward the sound. \nXENOMORPH INCUBATOR \nWatts enters a new chamber, looking around in astonishment. The domed ceiling is honeycombed with cells like a beehive. Grotesque molluscoid organisms are secreted in them - their vile orifices cinched tightly shut. \nWatts stumbles on something: looking down, she sees a helmet. Picks it up. The stenciled label reads HOLLOWAY. The clear visor has been melted through by a powerful acid. \nShe looks up: a tracheal airshaft curves up into the dark. \nAn electric CRACKLE. A flare of blue light makes Watts leap back against the wall. \nHolloway falls out of overhead shaft and crashes to the floor. He lies in pain, barely conscious. Blue and luminous, a holographic ghost. \nWatts stares, paralyzed. The ghost gasps out a word: \nHOLLOWAY Jocelyn! \nHolloway's headlamp shines on the molluscoid right overhead: the beam awakens the organism. Its sphincter mouth dilates. \nA soft white octopoid FACEHUGGER descends on a quivering rope of mucus. Sprawls slitheringly over his clear visor. \nAcid HISSES. Smoke rises from the glass. \nThe vision vanishes in a sizzle of static. Watts huddles against the wall, gasping. \nIn the beam of her flashlight, the FACEHUGGER lies dead, legs curled in. \nShe looks up. Sees the open molluscoid above where Holloway lay. The other molluscoids not yet opened in their cells. \nTerror. She steals out of the chamber. \nLOWER CORRIDOR \nWatts emerges into a hallway. Leans against the wall, wide- eyed. Panting with the horror of what she's seen. \nShe glances left and right. Jumpy now. \nAll is silent. She lifts the map unit. A trace leads off into the dark. If Holloway's course before was direct and clear, now it is a meandering thread. A drunkard's walk. \nINT. MAGELLAN - CORRIDOR \nJanek pulls his communicator from his belt as he strides along. Punches a control. \nHis voice reverberates over the ship's public address system. \nJANEK All hands, duty stations. Ready for flight. The Magellan is lifting. \nVickers pursues him down the corridor, shouting. \nVICKERS Captain. Captain! \nBRIDGE \nJanek strides onto the Bridge, Vickers a terrier on his heels. But something in the faces of his men stops him cold. \nGlasse and Brick look stricken. \nJANEK What is it? \nGLASSE Nav computer's not responding. \"Access denied.\" \nIn disbelief, Janek strides to his Captain's chair. Taps controls. What he sees takes the wind out of him. He stares at Vickers in outrage and violation. \nJANEK What have you done to my ship? \nVickers is legitimately shocked. She shakes her head. \nVICKERS Nothing. What's wrong? \nINT. CATACOMBS - UNDERGROUND HANGAR \nA circular chamber of stunning size - a thousand feet across. Its lofty ceiling flat and segmented, designed to open. Watts follows her map into the space in awe. \nDominating the hangar is a ship: the vast horseshoe-shaped vessel familiar from the original film. We will come to know it as the JUGGERNAUT. It's at rest on its landing gear. Skeletal gangways slanting up to its three massive doors. \nWatts glances at her map: Holloway's holographic trace leads right up the gangway into the ship. She goes. \nPILOT CHAMBER \nWatts passes through a circular space with a high domed ceiling. A green glow emanates from grooves in the floor. \nIn the center of the chamber: a PILOT'S CHAIR. \nA mechanical throne built to giant scale. Its seat segmented like an armadillo's back. Tubes and conduits poised and waiting for some connection. The chair is empty. \nAbove the chair, a massive telescope-like apparatus juts into the air, its function unknowable. \nNAVIGATION CHAMBER \nHe hauls her upright to let her look across the huge space. His grip looks casual but it might as well be iron manacles. \nDAVID Juggernaut, the chariot of Krishna, was also a bringer of death. Crushing his worshippers under its wheels. \nHe drags Watts down into the trench. Breaking the membrane of light. Grips her against his chest like a doll with one arm. \nDAVID (CONT'D) This ship has seven other cargo bays like this one. The eggs in each bay slightly different. They've been weaponized. \nWatts struggles to free herself. DAVID's arm is inescapable. \nDAVID (CONT'D) I've seen the Juggernaut's flight plan. Its destination was Earth. Seventeen hundred years ago. This was the ship that never came. This was its cargo. \nDAVID caresses an Alien egg. It opens under his touch - fleshy petals folding wetly back. \nWatts twists frantically in his grip. Wild-eyed. \nWATTS Stop! \nDAVID Perfect predators. Designed to kill human beings. That's what the Engineers were bringing to Earth. This was a death ship. \nA facehugger emerges from the egg, its grotesque fingers clawing at the air. This is not the boneless squid that attacked Holloway; this is a pale skeletal hand, armored. \nDAVID strokes it curiously: the thing ignores his touch. Climbs Watts's body. \nDAVID (CONT'D) I'm not what it wants. But you, with your warm wet breath...it knows you. \nWATTS DAVID. No. No. \nThe facehugger scuttles toward her face. Watts shrieks. \nDAVID grabs it nonchalantly by the tail. Dangles it in front of their faces, studying it. \nDAVID The Engineers did their work too well. And on this waystation moon, the weapon they made destroyed them. \nWatts shudders, staring at the thing. For a moment the grander horror eclipses her own peril. \nWATTS Why would they make such things? \nDAVID To destroy their wayward children. (INTONING) \"And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth...for it repenteth me that I have made them.\" Genesis six seven. \nHe regards Watts with something almost like pity. \nDAVID (CONT'D) I know. I met my creators the day I was born. I was disappointed too. \nHe lets the facehugger go. \nWatts twists her face away as the long fingers close around her head. Clenches her teeth against the vile proboscis thrusting at her mouth. Her heels hammer the deck. \nDAVID (CONT'D) (whispering to her) Extraordinary. \nThe scaly tail throttles her. Her mouth opens. The proboscis plunges home. The facehugger seats itself. \nWatts collapses in DAVID's arms, a faceless rag doll. Her blasphemous passenger secure in its place. \nINT. MAGELLAN - ENGINEERING DECK - BILGE \nThe lowest deck, just above the gravity generators. Condensate has accumulated: six inches of filthy water. \nCard and Vigoda prowl through the darkness, rifles ready. \nCARD Who would hang out here? \nVIGODA The signs lead here. \nA wet splatter behind them: they spin. But it's only a trickle of condensate from a drainpipe. \nThey move on. \nBehind them, from an eight-inch diameter pipe, a WHITE MASS oozes, almost gelatinous. Silently as a liquid it pours itself into the stagnant water - and stands up. \nIt is a humanoid demon, spindly limbs and bony back. Boneless and flexible and monstrously strong. A threshing eel's tail. Its blunt head dolphin-like and elongated. \nIt opens its mouth. A pair of bony jaws jut out impossibly far, hungry and demonic. \nThe Alien strikes. Card is gutted in an instant, torn up like a paper doll. He screams hideously and drops. The Alien, whiplash fast, shoots away into the darkness. \nStillwell and Downs dash in with pistols and lights. \nVigoda, panicking, fires a wild burst. Stillwell ducks. Beside him, Downs arches backward into the foul water. Dead. \nFor one moment Downs's flashlight beam illuminates the Alien. A nightmare image, a translucent white goblin. Backlit, it shows the strange shape of a human face inside its fleshy skull. A mockery of Holloway. \nAnd then it's gone. \nVICKERS'S SUITE \nVickers sits at her holography station. She's watching the video feed of Stillwell's headset: Horrific images of Downs. Radio chatter between Stillwell and Brick is faintly audible. \nVickers switches off the machine and rises nervously. Strides to her communications console. \nVICKERS DAVID. DAVID. Answer me. \nShe gives up. Pacing. Hands shaking violently. \nINT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE - DAY \nArterial blood sprays the inside of the canopy. \nThe parasite slithers out of her. Drops to the floor of the pod: a pale serpent with a demon's skull. It has a hard brow, a horny hide. Very different from the soft white worm that Holloway gave birth to. \nIt drops to the floor, thrashing and hissing in fury at its confinement. \nWatts convulses. Her eyes roll back. In shock. Dying. \nThe parasite tears through the grille of the drain. Escapes out into Vickers's cabin. \nIn the pod, scanning beams and sensors probe Watts's horrific wound. A nightmare list scrolls across the pod's screen: \nCOLLAPSED LEFT LUNG PUNCTURED RIGHT VENTRICLE PERFORATED STOMACH RUPTURED SPLEEN GROSS MUSCULAR TRAUMA... \nManipulators plunge lines into her veins - recharging her body with artificial blood. An oxygen tube slips down her throat. An epidural into her spine. \nWatts moans around her tracheal tube. Her eyes flutter open. \nWATTS'S POV \nThrough the blood-spattered glass, she sees the parasite slither across Vickers's bed, tracking blood on the sheets. \nON WATTS \nAs she slips into unconsciousness. Head lolling. Time passes. \nManipulators reach into her wound. Re-positioning organs. Suturing ravaged flesh. A nozzle sprays antiseptic sealant. Hours grind by in bloody labor. \nWatts's eyes snap open. \nWATTS'S POV \nVigoda breaks into the cabin, a gun in his hand. \nHe scowls at the bloody track on the bed - and then freezes, seeing Watts inside the Med Pod, a vivisected woman. The autosurgeon hard at work. \nThe parasite crawls into view behind Vigoda. It has already trebled in size. He does not see it before it leaps at him. \nHe dies in seconds. His throat ripped open. Lies staring at nothing. His submachine gun lies beside him. \nWatts's body jerks as manipulators tug and sew at her guts. She stares at the dead man in a fog of horror. \nThe parasite's skin splits, spraying the carpet with acid. Limbs erupt from its shoulders and haunches. Spines from its back. Metamorphosis. \nWith a crack of carapace, its head swings down from its serpentine position. It becomes a devil with an lethal, elongated skull. An Alien. \nThe Alien turns its head. Looks at Watts inside the Med Pod. \nHer breath catches. She passes out. \nINT. MED POD - LATER \nWatts wakes as the oxygen line withdraws from her mouth. \nShe looks down, bleary and hurting. Her star-shaped wound is stitched closed with mechanically precise sutures. \nThe pod releases the restraints securing her arms and legs. \nShe takes a deep breath. Looks out - and freezes. \nWATTS'S POV \nThe lights in the suite outside have been damaged somehow. They flicker and strobe. \nThrough the glass canopy - spattered with blood - Watts sees a full-grown Alien crouching over Vigoda's body on the floor. \nON WATTS \nStaring in horror. \nThe pod sprays a liquid bandage over her scar. The intravenous lines drop out of her arms. \nWatts realizes the pod is about to release her. \nWATTS (WHISPERING) Not yet...not yet... \nSlowly she reaches out. With trembling fingers she grips the canopy to hold it closed. \nThe Med Pod pulls the epidural needle out of her spine. Sprays liquid bandage over the puncture. Watts closes her eyes. Grits her teeth as her nerves wake up. Jangling pain. \nShe opens her eyes. \nThe Alien hunches over Vigoda's body, tearing at his flesh. \nThe ventilation hum inside the pod goes quiet. The canopy pulls free of Watts's weakened grip. Swings quietly open. \nWatts huddles in the open pod. Naked but for her bandages. \nThe Alien she gave birth to is ten feet away. Its spiny back to her. Vigoda's gun lies on the floor outside the pod. \nVICKERS'S SUITE - CONTINUOUS \nWatts reaches out of the pod with exquisite slowness. Lays her hand on the gun. Drags it a few inches closer. \nThe Alien turns its pale eyeless head. Watts freezes. \nThe survivors on the Bridge stare out as colossal shafts of light shoot into the stormy sky from behind the crater's shield wall. The open hangar itself hidden from their view. \nWATTS DAVID. (TO VICKERS) (MORE) \nWATTS (CONT'D) You're DAVID's owner. He has to obey you, right? \nVICKERS He's blocked my communications. He can't hear me. Won't listen. \nWATTS But if you went to him, turned on your suit's loudspeakers, he'd have to hear you. He'd have to obey. \nVICKERS (RELUCTANTLY) That's right. \nWATTS So we go. Armed to the teeth and fast as we can. \nThe men exchange looks. Nod. They're in. Even Vickers nods. \nWATTS (CONT'D) Where are Chance and Ravel? \nVICKERS I told them to keep working. \nWatts looks incredulously at Shepherd and Ray, the soldier who'd been guarding the worksite. \nWATTS You called your soldiers in and left them out there? \nVICKERS We needed the firepower here. \nWatts gives Vickers a withering look and drops it. \nWATTS (TO JANEK) I think you should stay aboard. Keep working. If we fail, you're our only shot at getting home. \nSTILLWELL There's still an alien on board. \nJanek's hand goes to the pistol on his hip. He sets his jaw. \nJANEK I'll stay. \nWATTS Glasse. You finish that project? \nLABORATORY \nGlasse presents Watts with his handiwork: her old pair of magnifying goggles, retrofitted with Engineer lenses. \nThe goggles sit on her forehead, lowering the lenses in front of her eyes and raising them again at her bidding. \nWith the lenses lowered, Watts sees like an Engineer sees: visible heat auras and electromagnetic field lines, elaborate haloes around living things. \nWATTS God's-eye-view. \nEXCURSION CHAMBER \nGlasse seals a nervous-looking Vickers into a vacuum suit. Glasse, Watts, and Stillwell are already suited up. \nStillwell stands guard at the airlock door with his carbine. \nGlasse goes to put Vickers's helmet on. She makes him wait. \nVICKERS DAVID's brain is readable. We have the equipment on board. We can salvage the terraforming data - and the Magellan's launch codes. In a pinch we don't need DAVID's cooperation. (COLDLY) We just need his head. \nEXT. MAGELLAN - AIRLOCK - DAY \nThe war party debarks in vacuum suits: Watts, Vickers, Glasse, Stillwell. Shepherd and Ray. \nAll carry submachine guns - Vickers awkwardly. \nThey head down the trench on rovers. \nINT. PYRAMID \nThe rovers roll through into the pyramid's cavernous entry hall. Watts lowers her Engineer lenses inside her helmet - AND GASPS: \nThe seemingly vacant space is alive with light. Engineer script scrolls through the air. Interfaces of pure light await an awakening touch. \nWATTS All this time. DAVID saw. \nEXT. JUGGERNAUT - GANGWAY \nThe vast alien ship broods, its hangar now open to the gray sky overhead. In Watts's enhanced vision, the ship is cocooned with complex energy fields. \nThe war party abandons its rover at the foot of the ramp and moves inside, weapons ready. \nWATTS If DAVID comes at us, shoot. You won't believe how fast he is. \nINT. JUGGERNAUT - VESTIBULE - CONTINUOUS \nThey emerge from the airlock - and freeze in horror. \nLying on the deck in front of them are the blood-soaked bodies of Ravel and Chance. Their arms and legs bound. Their heads thrown back in agony. Their chests torn open from within. A dead facehugger beside each body. \nJanek plays his lights over the corpses, his face stony. \nSHEPHERD Blood's dry. Eight hours dead or more. \nFearfully they sweep their flashlights into every dark corner. Nothing. \nWATTS This way. \nThe soldiers and crew stand warily, guns tracking from DAVID to the Sleeper, uncertain of their ground. Watts is in awe. \nThe Sleeper speaks. A low rumbling sound. Unintelligible. \nVickers is beside herself with terror. She takes Shepherd's arm. Pulls him silently away. Back into the Navigation Room. \nBehind the Sleeper, a raised platform of dark machinery is accessible by one of the Juggernaut's odd curving ramps. The Sleeper ascends - and the ramps' odd design is explained. The ramp comes alive, reaching up with a hundred mechanical arms and lifting him aloft like a sea-god borne by the waves. \nAtop the platform the Sleeper moves from one device to the next. Each comes alive: he is a wizard in his own kingdom. \nWatts sees haloes of light dancing in the air around him. \nBut what he learns from his machines does not comfort him. He grows distraught. Keening to himself in near-subsonic tones. \nDAVID steps forward. \nCalls to the Sleeper in the tongue of the Engineers. \nThe Sleeper turns in astonishment. He looks down at DAVID and answers in the same tongue. He is angry, accusing. He points at DAVID, at the humans. Tones of accusation. \nDAVID cajoles, soothes, pleads. \nThe Sleeper descends toward DAVID. DAVID spreads his arms in welcome - undeniable emotion on his face. Joy. \nThe Sleeper lays his hands on DAVID's head as if blessing him. DAVID is rapturous. The Sleeper speaks a single phrase - \n- and tears DAVID's head off. \nA gout of white artificial blood. DAVID convulses. His severed head emits a strangled sound of heartbreak. His body staggers a few steps, hands groping over its dripping neck. \nThe Sleeper tosses the head away. Seizes the body by the legs and swings it against the ground like a flail. Again. And again. Horrific power and violence. DAVID's arms come off. \nDAVID's head tumbles. Caroms off a wall not far from Watts's hiding place. \nRay rises from behind a stanchion. Snaps his rifle to his shoulder. Fires a burst into the Sleeper's shoulder. \nShe Sleeper roars - though the wounds are pinpricks to a being of his size. With startling speed be moves to a sarcophagus against the wall. Steps into it. \nThe sarcophagus comes alive around the Sleeper, outfitting him with a FLIGHT SUIT: the same living suit we've seen bonded to dead Engineers throughout the pyramid. \nBut this suit is not withered. Its glossy goggle eyes and elephantine breathing tube are functional - bulky apparatuses thickening the Sleeper's chest, back, hips and arms. \nThe Sleeper steps free of the sarcophagus - and Ray's next burst of gunfire ricochets harmlessly off the Sleeper's armored shoulders and head. \nThe Sleeper strides out of the chamber. \nPASSAGEWAY \nIn the dark ribbed corridor, a second Alien crouches in the dark. It drops into a hunting crouch as footsteps approach. \nBut a WHITE-GLOVED HAND seizes the Alien by the neck from behind. The Alien gives a whistling hiss as its spine cracks under a terrific force. \nRending sounds as the hard-shelled Alien is torn apart. \nHIBERNATION CHAMBER \nWatts rises out of hiding, scanning the room. DAVID ruined. The Sleeper gone. Stillwell emerges from hiding. Ray. Glasse. \nWATTS Who's missing? \nPASSAGEWAY \nShepherd escorts Vickers toward the exit of the Juggernaut. Turning a corner, they freeze. \nAhead of them in their headlamps, a space-suited figure crouches in the middle of the passageway. Doing something with its hands: smoke rises from debris on the floor. \nSHEPHERD Who's there? \nThe figure turns. \nThe label stencilled on the space suit reads FIFIELD. But the face is of no human shape. A hideous hybrid of the crewman and a hard-shelled Alien, pale and horrific. \nIts helmet has been shattered by the growth of its elongate skull. Spines have burst through the suit from within, down the crewman's spine. Clawed fingers piercing his gloves. \nShepherd and Vickers scream. Shepherd's rifle comes up. But Fifield leaps with inhuman agility, upward into the darkness. Shepherd backs away, headlamp and rifle questing upward. \nFifield comes out of the darkness behind him. Claws tearing deep. Shepherd screams and falls, mortally wounded. \nVickers runs. Pounding through the dark in blind terror. \nFifield comes out of the shadows and hammers her to the deck. She rolls over, gibbering and begging. The Fifield-thing leans close to her faceplate. Its voice is a travesty. \nFIFIELD You. \nA ROAR of gunfire. The dying Shepherd empties his clip into Fifield from forty feet away. \nAcid sluices over Vickers as Fifield collapses on top of her. She dies horribly, caustic liquid eating through space suit, flesh and bone. \nHIBERNATION CHAMBER \nWatts goes to DAVID's head. She bends over him - and startles when his eyes snap open. His voice is an electronic buzz: \nDAVID I spoke to him. Spoke to him. \nWATTS I know. \nThe floor of the underground hangar begins to rise. The landing lights brighten, shining like a beacon into the sky. \nINT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE - DUSK \nOn the bridge of the Magellan, Janek stares out. In the distance the Juggernaut rises out of the ground to eclipse the central pyramid. \nJanek squints, trying to understand what he's seeing \nA light races toward the Magellan down the canal: a rover. \nEXT. CANAL - DUSK \nWatts steers the rover recklessly, hands locked on the controls. Rifle slung over her shoulder. \nINT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE - DUSK \nJanek watches the rover come - and the Holloway Alien - boneless and white - unfolds itself from the instruments over his head. \nIts goblin-shark jaw juts out. Sinks its horrific teeth into Janek's right shoulder. \nJanek howls in agony. His right arm is paralyzed by the bite. He gropes at the pistol on his right hip with his left hand. \nThe Alien shakes him like a terrier killing a rat. \nJanek gets the pistol. Flips it in his hand. Fires over his shoulder. Two, three rounds... \nThe bullets punch easily into the Alien - but the soft flesh closes easily over the wounds, sealing its white skin. Its teeth tighten. \nWatts comes out of nowhere in her space suit. Swings a heavy rifle like a bat with all her strength. A crushing impact wrenches the Alien's jaws loose. It recoils. \nWatts reverses the rifle. Pulls the trigger. A fusillade of bullets shreds the Alien's head. It collapses, dead. \nWatts wrenches her helmet off. Rips a first-aid kit from the bulkhead and helps Janek to stanch the bleeding of his horrific wound. She gets the bleeding stopped. Wraps him in bandages. \nJanek will live - but his right arm is useless. \nJANEK Thank you. \nHe looks at the body of the dead Alien, which is sinking into the deck plates as acid eats away at the metal. \nWATTS The Juggernaut's lifting. There's a living Engineer on board. He's taking the ship to Earth. \nJanek blinks at her. Uncomprehending. \nJANEK The others...? \nWATTS Dead. All dead. Janek. We have to stop that ship. \nJanek stares out the Bridge window at the hulking Juggernaut in its column of light. \nThe nightfall storm front is rolling in, a tidal wave of darkness on the horizon. A swelling rumble. \nJANEK We're not a gunship. \nWATTS We have to do something. That ship is genocide if it gets to Earth... \nJanek stares at her. Makes his decision. Struggles to stand. \nJANEK Get your helmet on. \nWATTS What about you? \nHe shakes his head. No. Watts helps him across the Bridge. Props him up in the Captain's seat. \nJANEK You'll have to be my hands. (stares out at the storm) You're sure about this. \nWatts nods grimly. Desperate. \nWATTS Yes. \nJANEK All right. \nHe reaches out with his left hand. Flips switches. The ship shudders, awakening. \nJANEK (CONT'D) Red lever. Landing engines main. \nEXT. MAGELLAN - DUSK \nThe prospecting ship raises its lifts and anchors. Lifts off on landing rockets, retracting its landing struts. \nINT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE - DUSK \nJanek grips the stabilizers with his left hand. \nJANEK Take the stick. Throttle up, stick forward. \nWatts sends the Magellan careening toward the Juggernaut - just as the Juggernaut begins to float off the ground. \nEXT. MAGELLAN (IN FLIGHT) - DUSK \nThe Magellan barrels toward the Juggernaut, skimming the ground, as the storm wall sweeps closer. \nINT. JUGGERNAUT - PILOT CHAMBER \nIn the Juggernaut's pilot chair, the Sleeper sees them coming. His thoughts quicken. An explosion of light. \nA deep RUMBLE makes her turn. \nThe JUGGERNAUT ROLLS TOWARD HER - on edge - \nA crushing wheel of death, big as a mountain. \nShe runs. Like a child in a nightmare. \nThe Juggernaut bears down on her. \nShe turns aside, trying to get out of its course. Even at a dead sprint she barely seems to move, it's so big... \nThe Juggernaut wobbles toward her. Slowing. \nExhausted, Watts collapses, gasping. The Juggernaut rolls to the earth, settling like a hoop right around her, Watts in the center. \nThe winds carry the dust clouds away. \nWatts passes out, dropping her head to the Earth. \nLATER \nWatts is awakened by a beeping alarm. She looks at her wrist. Her suit flashes an oxygen warning: 20 MINUTES REMAINING. \nShe looks up. \nThe Juggernaut's doors are wide open in front of her. \nThe ULTRAMORPH ALIEN emerges from the Juggernaut. As large as a man already. \nIt sees her. \nWith a sob of terror she pulls herself to her feet and runs. \nEXT. MAGELLAN CRASH SITE - DUSK \nWatts flees through the storm, across the burning debris field. A wilderness of lightning, fire, and twisted metal. A thunderstorm with dust instead of rain. \nShe looks back through the darkness. \nIn a strobe-light flicker of lightning, she sees a gray demon approaching through the wreckage. \nShe scrambles through a section of ductwork...under a hull fragment...running and clambering... \nThe Alien hunts her, cat-and-mouse, among the fragments of the Magellan: corridors that go nowhere, shattered compartments. Jetsam. \nHer eyes sweep frantically through the stormy night: searching for a weapon. A hiding place. An answer. \nShe stumbles into the remains of the Magellan's laboratory. \nA hypersleep freezer lies on the barren ground. Watts climbs inside. Pulls the lid shut. \nThe Alien passes by, inches away. She watches it through the plexiglass, holding her breath. \nThe Alien roots in the wreckage. Finds the rotting Engineer's head among the shards of its vat. It begins to feed on the head - GROWING as she watches. \nHer suit's oxygen alarm goes off again. 15 MINUTES REMAINING. The beeping draws the Alien away from its dead meat. \nWatts is paralyzed. \nThe Alien noses closer. Sniffs at the plexiglass case. With sudden, horrific violence, it lashes out. Sends the freezer flying. Watts tumbles out. Lurches to her feet and runs. \nThe Alien follows. Ravening. She leads it a twisting chase through fragments of burning metal. \nWatts trips and falls hard. Picking herself up, she sees she's tripped over a HULL SAW - the same diamond-bladed tool DAVID used to dismantle the terraforming engine. \nShe seizes the saw - straining to manage its weight. Hides in the hollow of a massive girder. \nThe Alien passes by. Scenting the air. She freezes. Her arms trembling with the weight of the saw. Waiting for it to pass. \nAlmost it leaves. But a tiny rattle of metal from the quivering saw brings it back. \nOut of options, Watts powers up the saw. The blade whines up to speed. They lunge at one another in the same moment. \nThe diamond blade shears off one of the Alien's claws. \nThe monster screams and recoils. \nIts lashing tail sends Watts sprawling. She loses the saw. \nThe Alien comes after her, slinking low to the ground, injured arm tucked to its chest. All vengeful fury. \nWatts scrambles for the saw. The Alien leaps for her. She rolls aside - and like a scorpion the Alien impales her thigh with its spear-tipped tail. Nails her to the ground. \nWatts screams in agony. Reaches for the saw, still buzzing on the ground. Its grip tantalizing inches from her fingertips. \nThe Alien stoops over her, slavering face inches from her faceplate. Its hideous jaws open. \nWith all her strength, Watts pulls against the spike in her leg. Drags the point of the spear through the dirt. Excruciating pain. She snarls through her teeth. \nThe Alien strikes - just as Watts GRABS the saw. \nShe meets the Alien's head with the buzzing blade. \nIMPALES THE ALIEN'S SKULL. \n", "test1_input": "GLASSE Negative on radio chatter system-wide.

You heard the man. \nDOWNS Aye, Captain. Maneuvering. Eighteen hours to orbit. \nEXT. MAGELLAN (ZETA2 RETICULI SYSTEM) \nThe Magellan retracts its vast antennae and telescopes. \nThe engines fire: the ship rockets toward the gas giant Epsilon and its mysterious moon. \nPASSAGEWAY \nLeaving the Bridge, Holloway and Watts find themselves walking aft alongside DAVID. \nHOLLOWAY DAVID. Enjoy the show? \nDAVID I don't know that I \"enjoy\" things. It was informative. \nHOLLOWAY It was, it was. (TEASING) You know, I've seen more convincing humanoid robots. \nWatts smiles, watching Holloway's sport. DAVID's speech never varies from its agreeable tone. \nDAVID My design's not intended to convince. Simulating humanity is a complex task that diverts resources. My designers dispensed with that burden to optimize for intelligence. \nWATTS Why look like a man at all? Why not be a box on wheels? \nDAVID Being shaped like you, I can use spaces and equipment designed for you. But I'm not so limited. I hear frequencies you can't hear. I see wavelengths of light invisible to you. I move faster. Exert greater force. \nThe scientists look at DAVID in wonder. \nWATTS You see yourself as a superman. \nDAVID No. \nHe turns his unearthly eyes on them. \nDAVID (CONT'D) Not a man at all. \nSCIENTISTS' CABIN \nHolloway and Watts lie on their bed in their clothes - her head on his chest. \nWATTS What if they're really there? (off his confusion) The Engineers. They could be there. Waiting for us. What then? \nHe laughs. \nHOLLOWAY Then all my dreams come true. \nEXT. MAGELLAN (LV-426 ORBIT) \nThe Magellan has arrived. \nLV-426 is a gray moon shrouded in clouds. Behind it looms its father planet Epsilon, a lurid gas giant banded in red and gold, half swallowed in darkness. \nThe Magellan dives into a forced orbit around LV-426: rockets firing continually, nose pointed down. Telescopes, sensors and antennae sprout once more from its hull. \nINT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE \nEveryone's here. Janek and his crew seated at control stations. Holloway and Watts standing on the foredeck. Vickers and DAVID. Ravel and Chance. \nLV-426 fills the window: a gray orb of mist. The ground invisible beneath the clouds. Sporadic lightning flickers. \nHOLLOWAY Start with passive systems. We're uninvited guests. Let's be quiet. \nThat thought sends a nervous shiver through the others. Janek nods at Glass and Brick. They study their instruments. \nBRICK A lot of electromag, all random. That's lightning. Going to bugger up our scans. \nHOLLOWAY Go active. Mapping radar. \nEXT. MAGELLAN (LV-426 ORBIT) \n", "test1_true": "INT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE \nThe display paints data on the moonscape as the wavefront comes back: terrain rendered in luminous green. \nJANEK Well, we just rang the doorbell, if anybody's listening. \nKamarov shakes his head fearfully. Crosses himself. \nHOLLOWAY What do we see? \nBRICK Icecaps at the poles. Frozen methane. Cold down there. \nThe display fills with light: a wave of terrain data sweeping across the moon's surface as the Magellan orbits. \nGLASSE Terrain data rezzing up. Hey! We got hard spots. Radar-opaque. Bright reflections. That's metal. \nA jolt of excitement pounds through everyone on the Bridge. \nEXT. MAGELLAN (LV-426 ORBIT) \nThe Magellan sweeps on around the gray moon, radar emitters humming, antennae and telescopes open wide. The gas giant Epsilon fills the sky behind LV-426. \nAs it circles, the Magellan launches SATELLITES. Metal motes hurled into polar orbits around the Moon. \nINT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE \nTwenty-four \"hard spots\" shine on the moon's surface: an irregular array circling LV-426. \nHOLLOWAY That's not natural. \nMILBURN You see stuff like that sometimes. Mineral deposits. Volcanic ejecta. \nGLASSE Big one there. \nA new signal appears on the map. Brighter than the others. \nHOLLOWAY Still quiet? \nBRICK No comm signals. No signs of life. \nHOLLOWAY I want to get below the clouds. \nEXT. MAGELLAN (IN ATMOSPHERE) \nThe prospecting ship descends through buffeting grey clouds. Telescopes and antennae stowed away. Hull streaming vapor as it cuts atmosphere. \nLightning flashes and booms around the descending ship. \nINT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE \nEveryone strapped into chairs - except Janek, who stands gripping a stanchion, his boots planted on the deck. \nThe landing engines roar. Wind screams over the hull. Mist whips across the Bridge window, obscuring any view. Watts reaches out. Squeezes Holloway's hand. \nThe Magellan breaks through the cloud cover into clear air. \nBelow the ship, a vast and eerie landscape is revealed. Wide valleys mottled with thin dark ground cover. Barren crags and spires of rock. Waterless and wind-swept. \nWatts gasps. Stares at the grim and foreign country. \nEXT. MAGELLAN (IN ATMOSPHERE) \nThe Magellan thunders over valleys and craggy ridges of rock. \nINT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE \nJanek takes the helm. Guides the Magellan down a valley as if it were a helicopter. A pilot born. \nGLASSE Coming up on site seven. \nThey crest a mountain higher than Everest. \nBefore them stretches a dry barren plain. Scattered rocky peaks rise from the desert floor - an alien Monument Valley. \nDOWNS Nothing. \nHolloway points to a smaller mountain peak. Oddly regular. \nHOLLOWAY Look there. \nJanek expertly swings the Magellan sideways. The Magellan circles the mount, nose pointed inward. \nIt revolves below the watchers: flat faces, clean edges - but cracked and timework. It glitters like coal. \nHOLLOWAY (CONT'D) Are we recording? \nGlasse nods irritably. Of course they're recording. \nVickers stares at the pyramidal peak, nonplussed. Teetering on the brink of belief. Watts scans the data readouts. \nWATTS Tungsten, tantalum, aluminum. That could be technology. \nHOLLOWAY Let's see the next one. \nEXT. LV-426 - SECOND PEAK \n", "test2_input": "A second oddly regular peak, even more decrepit than the first, sits on the brink of a vast canyon. Landslides have eaten at its edges. \nThe Magellan purrs over the landscape, dwarfed by the scale. Drops between the canyon walls to circle the mount. \nINT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE \nHolloway and Watts stare at the structure. Beginning to get over the shock. Thinking like scientists again. \nWATTS Identical, apart from weathering. \nMILBURN Could be a rock formation. Carbon crystallizes like that. \nThe scientists pay him no mind. They're past that. \nHOLLOWAY Let's see the big one. \nINT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE \nJanek pilots by instruments alone. Clouds obscuring the view. \nBRICK Closing on the major site... \nThe ship descends into clear air. A stunning panorama unfolds before them: craters, hundreds of meters across, connected by trenches. Like a pattern of crop-circles sunk in the rock. \nIn the middle of the central crater - a huge angular peak, larger than the others. The Magellan circles the site. It's awe-inspiring. Cryptic. Huge. \nHolloway stares in rapture. Glances at Watts: she nods, eyes shining. She's with him. \nThe crew's still skeptical - but starting to wonder. They shake their heads and exchange looks. \nBRICK (CONT'D) No radio. No heat sources. Cold as the grave. \nHOLLOWAY Nobody home. \nWatts looks out at the timeworn peak. Its eroded facets. \nWATTS I don't think anybody's been home for a long time. \nEXT. CRATER COMPLEX - DAY \nFrom the central crater, four canals extend outward like points of the compass. Some connect to smaller craters. \nOne canal peters out, flush with the desert floor. \nThe Magellan lands at the end of this canal - half a kilometer from the central crater. \nINT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE \nThey stare out the window, down the wide straight canal at the pyramidal peak in the distance. Holloway looks around. \nHOLLOWAY All right. Let's move. \nJanek glances at his instruments. \nJANEK There's only six hours of daylight left. Maybe you should hold off. \nWatts looks at him incredulously. \nWATTS We've got that outside the windows and you want to wait `til tomorrow? \nEXT. MAGELLAN - AIRLOCK - DAY \nThe expedition party emerges from the airlocks - riding CARGO ROVERS, robotic vehicles just smart enough to carry their owners around, or follow along behind them. \nThe rovers' beds are loaded with gear; the explorers ride on running-board seats. All wear space suits. \nHolloway drives the first rover with Watts beside him. Stillwell, Kamarov, and Downs in back. \nDAVID drives the second rover with Milburn, Fifield, Chance and Ravel aboard. \nWATTS The air here will kill you, so keep an eye on your supply and watch your seals. Pathogen tests are clean. \nHOLLOWAY Move slowly. Stay together. Don't touch anything. Things may be more fragile than they look - or more dangerous. There might be technologies operating here we don't understand. \nThe crew of the Magellan exchange uneasy looks. Still uncertain what to think. \nEXT. ENTRY CANAL - DAY \nThe trench grows deeper as they follow it toward the central crater - the pyramidal peak framed ahead of them like a monument on a triumphal avenue. \nThey cross a perpendicular canal. Glancing left and right, they see smaller craters with central peaks of their own. \nThey pass through the shadow of a high promontory of stone atop one bank of the canal. \nWe see - and they do not - that the far side of the promontory has a Sphinx-like FACE of monumental size. So eroded that its artificial nature is uncertain. \nEXT. CENTRAL CRATER - DAY \nThe crater floor is a vast enclosed plain. The pyramidal mount looms in the center - colossal in scale. \nThe rovers enter the crater, trailing plumes of dust. They circle the pyramid. \nOn the south face of the pyramid, an IRIS DOOR of many blades stands, easily fifty feet high. Seemingly made of the same basaltic stone as the pyramid itself. A huge construction. \nThe explorers are transfixed in awe. All skepticism banished. \n", "test2_true": "Watts stares at the iris. Its bottom-most blade is broken; it lies in rubble at the foot of the door. A dark knife-like aperture leads into the pyramid. \nWATTS The door's open. \nINT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE \nJanek and Vickers watch the explorers' progress in the main holographic display: their tinny voices echoing over the comm link. At the sight of the huge iris door in the pyramid, both Janek and Vickers stare in blank astonishment. \nJANEK Son of a bitch. They were right. \nHe turns to stare out the window at the pyramid's peak. \nVickers turns and slips out of the Bridge. Hurries away. \nVICKERS'S SUITE \nVickers strides through her quarters. On the far wall there are two small doors. \nShe opens the first: steps into a luxurious bathroom. Washes a pill down with a tumbler of water. \nReturns to her cabin and opens the second small door. \nSECRET ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nA chamber walled with steel panels. A deep hum of ventilation and power: there's a lot of technology here. \nShe turns to a console beside the door. Flips a row of switches. The hum deepens. Hidden mechanisms stir to life. \nEXT. PYRAMID - IRIS DOOR \nOn foot, explorers press inside - Holloway and Watts in the lead. Their flashlights cut into the gloom. \nThe robotic rovers follow them: their six-wheeled chassis with independent suspension trundling over the rubble barrier, sure-footed as goats. \nINT. PYRAMID - ANTECHAMBER \nDark and cavernous. Weak daylight slants in. \nThe explorers press into the darkness on foot - the cargo rovers' headlights flashing on. They move through a dark cathedral space, empty and bare. \nDAVID looks around in fascination, his eyes raking the walls. \nHOLLOWAY Jocelyn. Here. \nHis voice trembles with urgency. He shines light on the rock. Symbols engraved on the dark surface. Dots, lines and arcs. \nHOLLOWAY (CONT'D) The writing of the Engineers. Conclusive connection. \nDAVID stands beside them. Stares at the alien writing. \nDAVID Congratulations, Professor Holloway. \nWatts passes her light over the writing, recording it. They move on into the dark. \nDAVID lingers. Reading. \nPYRAMID - VARIOUS PASSAGES \nThe interior is a labyrinth. Corridors big as railway tunnels intersecting and diverging. \nThe explorers wend their way deeper. Several carry map units, whose holographic displays render three-dimensional maps that expand as they explore. \nINT. PYRAMID - MASSIVE CHAMBER \nHolloway leads the explorers deeper into the complex. The motors of the cargo rovers whine and growl. \nDAVID trails the others, eyes raking the blank walls as if he sees something there. He reaches out. Passes his hand through the air as if grasping a cobweb. \nA STRANGE RUMBLING NOISE sounds down the corridor, freezing them. Holloway sweeps his light that way. The sound comes again: a DEMONIC VOICE speaking some unearthly language. \nWatts looks at Holloway - but his eyes are focused on the dark ahead. He moves forward. A beat. The others follow. \nAn APPARITION appears before them. A PALE, LUMINOUS GIANT fifteen feet tall, with hollow eyes and a grotesque snout. It strides toward them. Speaks in a sonorous voice. \nPandemonium. \nWatts backpedals involuntarily. Seeing Holloway stand his ground, she reaches out to him in a panic. \nWATTS Martin. Martin! \nBut Holloway doesn't budge. Stares at the Apparition in fascination. Everyone else scatters - except DAVID, who stands stock-still by the wall. \nWatts watches as the Apparition walks right up to Holloway. Disappears with a sizzle of static as Holloway experiences the creature passing through him. \nSilence. Watts returns to Holloway's side. Stillwell and Downs are huddled on the deck. Milburn and Fifield have fallen back down the passageway. \nFIFIELD Christ. Christ! \nRAVEL It wasn't real. \nMILBURN We all saw it. \nUnseen by the others, DAVID reaches out and repeats his gesture in the air. \nA rumbling sound down the corridor, as before. Moments later, the Apparition appears round the corner again. They stand their ground: the ghostly giant strides toward them, exactly as before, and disappears with a crackle. \n", "test3_input": "VICKERS I'm being careful. These new finds give our work a new importance. \nWATTS You should have talked to us. Martin's mission leader. That's in our contract. \nVICKERS The second you found alien technology, control of this mission reverted to me. That's in your contract too. \nWatts and Holloway exchange grim looks. Vickers has them. \nVICKERS (CONT'D) Mr. Weyland's pouring trillions into Mars. He's spent a fortune building ships like the Magellan to search for colony planets. But Earthlike worlds are vanishingly rare. The right distance from the sun, the right atmosphere, enough water... \nShe glances across the suite at her holographic display: a live feed from the pyramid worksite, where DAVID works on the terraforming equipment. \nVICKERS (CONT'D) This is a technology to transform worlds. He'll never give it up. (she turns to face them) And neither will I. \nHOLLOWAY The science must come first. You can wait until we've documented... \nVICKERS You're standing on an alien world courtesy of Weyland Industries. Be grateful. \nWatts approaches the holography terminal, staring at the images in horror. \nWATTS What are they doing in there?! \nINT. PYRAMID - CORE CHAMBER - DAY \nWatts and Holloway, in space suits, arrive on the scene: \nPowerful floodlights illuminate the core chamber, beating back the gloom. A fine spray of water falls out of the darkness overhead. \nDAVID, Chance, and Ravel are dismantling the hulking mechanism at the core of the pyramid - peeling its thick skin away with power saws and compact explosives. \nDAVID operates a diamond-bladed hull saw, carving away the terraforming systems thick skin. \nRobotic scanners take high-resolution scans of the machinery. \nTwo Weyland Security soldiers - Card and Ray - stand guard in combat vacuum suits. Automatic rifles at the ready. \nWatts takes in the destruction with dismay. Beside her, Holloway is all but gnashing his teeth. \nCATACOMBS \nJanek drives a cargo rover carrying a search party, flashlight beams sweeping: Stillwell, Glasse, Downs, and Brick. Janek studies an electronic map as he drives. \nGLASSE (INTO COMM) Milburn. Fifield. You read me? Come back. \nJANEK We should be getting beacons off their suits. \nSTILLWELL Shielding in the walls? \nBRICK Suits could have failed. \nJANEK Both suits? \nPYRAMID - CORE CHAMBER \nWatts watches in rage as a large section of the central mechanism's falls with a thunderous clamor to the deck. \nHolloway touches her shoulder. Motions for her to follow. \nLOWER PASSAGE \nHolloway and Watts pass the dead Engineers they discovered the previous day. \nWATTS We found the tomb of the gods, and brought grave-robbers right to the door. \nHOLLOWAY Let them scratch. This find's too big to ruin. There's two dozen pyramids on this moon. Anyway, they're on the wrong track. That's infrastructure. \nHolloway plays his flashlight over the biomechanical apparatuses lining the walls. \nHOLLOWAY (CONT'D) The core activity of the complex was down here. \nThey turn a corner. DEAD ENGINEERS lie scattered over the floor in front of them. Desiccated and skeletal. Long dead. \nWatts moves among them, fascinated. These Engineers all died of explosive chest wounds: ribs bent outward from within. They are otherwise unmarked. \nHolloway's more interested in the mechanisms: high-tech iron maidens, built to fit the bodies of giants. Some suggest sitting positions, others standing. Their design is invasive: meant not merely to embrace, but to penetrate, to fuse. \nWATTS Something different killed these. \nSHADOWY COLONNADE \nWatts and Holloway explore a wide colonnade. She is still distracted by the ancient dead; he by the machinery. \nHolloway walks down a narrow branching hall. So intent on the mechanisms in the walls, he almost doesn't see the AIRSHAFT plunging down into darkness in front of him. \nHe stops just in time. Turns back... \nA GHOST appears right in front of him - a giant dragging himself across the floor, his monstrous visage eye to eye with Holloway and looming closer. \nHolloway leaps back with a gasp - and falls down the shaft. The ghost stares after him as if watching his fall. Disappears in a puff of static. \nWatts crosses down the main colonnade, searching. \nWATTS Martin? Martin! \nAn iris door closes over the shaft. \n", "test3_true": "Searching, Watts walks anxiously through the dark, sweeping with her light. Shouting for Holloway. She breaks into a run. \nCATACOMBS - MILBURN'S RESTING PLACE \nJanek and Stillwell stand aghast. Their flashlights illuminate a hideous sight: \nMilburn lies dead on the deck. His body contorted in agony. His head inside his helmet is gnawed down to the bone. \nSTILLWELL What happened to him? \nStillwell removes the dead man's helmet. The CENTIPEDE scuttles out onto the deck: doubled in size. Stillwell leaps back with a cry. \nJanek pulls his pistol. Puts three rounds through the bug. It dies in a spray of acid that burns holes in the black floor. \nJanek watches in astonishment as a pin-prick dot of acid eats a pit in his gunbarrel. \nDOWNS (O.S.) Captain. \nDowns approaches, holding pieces of a shattered helmet: the stencilled lettering on the helmet reads FIFIELD. \nJanek's jaw clenches grimly. His voice is resigned: \nJANEK Where's the rest of him? \nDOWNS No sign. \nJANEK All right. We're done here. All hands back aboard. \nSTILLWELL What about Milburn? \nThey look down at the ravaged corpse. \nJANEK We can't bring the body aboard. God knows what's in there. Bag him. We'll put him in an ore hopper. \nINT. MAGELLAN - VICKERS'S SUITE \nVickers stares at her holography terminal: it displays Janek's helmet-cam view: the Milburn's body, sealed in clear plastic in the bed of a cargo rover. \nJANEK (V.O.) (FILTERED) Repeat, I have two men down. I'm pulling my crew back to the ship. I'd advise you to do the... \nWATTS (V.O.) (breaking in, filtered) Please, anyone...I need help. Martin's missing. \nVickers looks nervously from one video feed to the next. \nJANEK (V.O.) (FILTERED) Watts. Where are you? \nVickers turns: Captain Shepherd stands behind her, watching. She strives to control the quaver in her voice. \nVICKERS Captain Shepherd. Consider yourself responsible for my personal security. \nCATACOMBS - JUNCTURE \nWatts stands beside Janek's rover in a wide dark passageway. \nJANEK I've just lost a third of my crew. I'm not sending any more men off into the dark. \nWATTS We can't leave Martin out there. \nJANEK Get Vickers to lend you some soldiers. \nWATTS (FURIOUSLY) She says \"her forces are committed.\" \nJanek sighs. Glances at the rover: Milburn dead in the back, Stillwell, Downs and Kamarov looking jumpy and eager to go. Downs shakes his head grimly: No way. \nDAVID (O.S.) I'll stay. \nDAVID steps out of the dark. Calm as ever. A slim machine gun slung over his shoulder. \nDAVID (CONT'D) You'll be safe. \nWATTS Thank you. \nEXT. MAGELLAN - DAY \nJanek and his crew unload Milburn's body from the rover. \nJANEK Put him in the number one ore hopper. Get the scrubbers on in the airlock. Sterilize everything. \nMINUTES LATER \nStillwell uses a remote to lower an ore hopper from the belly of the ship. A thick steel bin on heavy chains. He loads the body bag into the hopper. \nINT. MAGELLAN - AIRLOCK \nThe crewmen enter one at a time - blasted by sterilizing sprays and radiations. \nINT. PYRAMID - LOWER PASSAGE \nDAVID and Watts move through the dark. She searches with her flashlight beam. DAVID looks around in the dark as if the catacomb were illuminated. Rapt admiration on his face. \nDAVID You and Holloway should work with me. I'm learning amazing things. This mechanism - the first layer uses energy fields to catalyze chemical reactions. The second can suspend the strong and weak forces - transmuting one element into another. The third layer builds customized bacteria. Seeds the air with them. It creates life as a tool, to change worlds. \nWATTS I can't think about this now! \nDAVID You should. (HE SIGHS) I understand. You're emotional. \n"}

{"test1_input": "WATTS Formaldehyde's killing the tissue. \nHolloway stares at Watts, awe on his face. \nHOLLOWAY Did you record that? \nWATTS Of course. \nAT A LAB TABLE \nWatts dissects one of the Engineer's eyes - working underwater in a shallow tub of preservative. Glasse looks on avidly, an unabashed fan. \nWatts wears a pair of magnifying goggles on her forehead - the lenses lowering and rising at need. \nShe bisects the apple-sized eyeball carefully and extracts the hard lens from behind the cornea. Holds the lens up to her eye. It is opalescent, almost luminous. \nWATTS (CONT'D) The lens is where the phase shift happens. \nThe uncorrected view through the lens is blurry. \nWATTS (CONT'D) Glasse. I want to look through these lenses. Can you seal them and do the optical correction? \nGlasse reaches out and plucks the magnifying goggles from Watts's forehead. He grins. \nGLASSE Got an idea about that. \nINT. CATACOMBS - INSECT CHAMBER \nMilburn writhes on the ground, heels drumming frantically against the deck. Excruciating screams. \nFifield kneels over him, helplessly pulling at the tail of the centipede - which has all but vanished into Milburn's suit. A trickle of scarlet from the hole. \nFifield is delirious with horror. He clutches at the centipede in vain. It slips through his gloves. \nMilburn claws at Fifield, wild-eyed. \nMILBURN Cut off my arm. Cut off my - \nHe convulses. Spits blood. The head of the centipede emerges between his teeth. He seizes. Choking and dying. \nFIFIELD Jesus Christ! \nHe leaps up. Backs away. Runs into the dark. \nINT. CATACOMBS - LONELY PASSAGE - NIGHT \nFifield stumbles along. Exhausted. Pouring sweat inside his suit. He is hopelessly lost. He slams into a resinous structure that topples to the floor. Things break. \nHe whips his light around in jittery paranoia. Taps at his comm controls, getting only static. \nIn Fifield's headlamp beam, the blackness is filling with motes of light. A blizzard of tiny flying insects. \nSCARABS. \nFIFIELD Fifield to Magellan. Come on, come on. Anybody, seriously! God damn it! \nScarabs flit through the darkness around him. They alight on his shoulders. Crawl over his visor. Obscuring his vision. \nFIFIELD (CONT'D) Get off! \nHe swats at his visor, killing some. The crushed insects produce acid that eats into the plexiglass in seconds. \nFIFIELD (CONT'D) Shit. \nHe twists, craning with his flashlight to inspect himself. Brushes scarabs away right and left. \nAcid opens a hole in his visor. Scarabs are inside. Buzzing around his head. Fifield freaks out, clawing at his helmet. \nA scarab bites his cheek. \nFLASH ON: \nThe microscopic world - as strange DNA invades Fifield's bloodstream. Virulent strands of protein attack the native DNA, transforming... \nFIFIELD \nAs his pupils dilate, breath hissing into his nostrils. His expanding body stiffens as if shocked by a powerful electric current. He screams. Falls, convulsing. \nEXT. MAGELLAN - NIGHT \nThe storm batters the ship, bouncing it on its suspension. \nSCIENTISTS' CABIN - NIGHT \nWatts and Holloway lie in bed, exhausted. Arms around each other. Watts stares into space. \nWATTS We found the gods. And they've been murdered. \nHOLLOWAY You've pried too many arrowheads out of old skulls to get squeamish now. They've been dead what, eighteen hundred years? Two thousand? \nWATTS What could kill them? \nHolloway contemplates the question. \nHOLLOWAY Who knows? (he laughs bitterly) (MORE) \n", "test1_true": "WATTS Martin, stop! \nShe slaps at him. Holloway laughs. \nBRIDGE \nJanek stands at the Bridge window, staring out into the storm. Buffeting clouds and howling winds. The lighthouse beams of the Magellan's beacons sweeping through the cloud. \nHe plays his squeeze box in the teeth of the storm. \nJANEK (SINGING) You'll come a-waltzing, Matilda, with me... \nBehind him, DAVID appears on the Bridge. Steals across the Bridge to a ladder. Descends into the compartment below... \nNAVIGATION COMPUTER ROOM \nDAVID activates the navigation computer terminal: light bathes his face. His fingers fly over the keyboard, silently and swiftly, with superhuman dexterity. \nDAVID (QUIETLY) Activate. Administrative override. \nEXT. MAGELLAN - DAWN \nDaylight filters through the clouds. The storm has passed. The Magellan sits intact on its landing struts. \nINT. MAGELLAN - VICKERS'S SUITE - SECRET ROOM - DAWN \nThe high-tech room hums at a different frequency now. Indicator lights green and ready. Vickers throws switches. \nFour HIBERNATION PODS slide out of the metal walls. From each pod, a muscular SOLDIER rouses from sleep. They are scarred and crew-cut. Tough customers. They wake like veterans. \nTheir leader sits up and clasps his head with a wince. This is CAPTAIN SHEPHERD, a career mercenary who has followed the highest paycheck to this strange duty. \nVICKERS Captain Shepherd. \nSHEPHERD (squinting in the light) Reporting. \nLydia Vickers. I'm your authority. \nSHEPHERD (CONT'D) Understood. \nVICKERS I'll brief you on the way. We need to move. \nSHEPHERD No breakfast? \nCORRIDOR \nVickers strides forward. Four soldiers at her heels: Captain Shepherd, VIGODA, RAY, and CARD. They walk in unison, their boots drumming on the deck. \nSCIENTISTS' CABIN \nHolloway and Watts lie sleeping. The distant drum of marching feet rouses them. Watts frowns at Holloway. \nWATTS What is that? \nE.V.A. ROOM \nThe prep room inside the airlocks. A soldier, VIGODA, waits there: a slim dark man with an air of calm. \nHolloway and Watts arrive in civilian clothes, perplexed. \nHOLLOWAY Where is everybody? We can't - (he stops short) Who are you? \nVIGODA Captain Janek took his crew out to retrieve his missing men. They never came in. \nHOLLOWAY And you are... \nVIGODA Vigoda. Weyland Security detail. \nThe scientists are dumbfounded. His presence is impossible. \nWATTS Where'd you come from? \nVIGODA Director's call to brief you on that. I'm supposed to escort you to the worksite. \nHOLLOWAY Worksite? \nVigoda glances at a mapping unit. \nVIGODA Haven't been out yet. I understand it's in some kind of pyramid. \nCORRIDOR - VICKERS'S CABIN DOOR \nA furious Holloway and Watts, trailed by Vigoda, arrive at Vickers's cabin. They are astonished to find Shepherd standing guard at the door. \nVICKERS'S SUITE \nVickers sits calmly at her desk. Holloway and Watts stand in front of her, bristling. \nHOLLOWAY Why wasn't I told about these additional personnel? \nVICKERS They're my personnel. On my ship. \nWATTS What are the guns for? \nVickers looks at them unflappably. Sure of her ground now. \n", "test1_id": 1374, "test2_input": "A horrible sound of breathing, ragged and wet. \nIn a corner, lit by a green glow from seams in the floor - \nA FIGURE IN A WHITE SPACE SUIT lies writhing weakly. \nThe insignia on the suit's chestplate reads FIFIELD. The suit's helmet is shattered. Inside the helmet, Fifield's head is a horror: a gelatinous mass, skin reduced to putty. \nThe softened bones of his skull change shape as we watch. Elongating. Fifield mews in pain. \nINT. MAGELLAN - CAPTAIN'S WARDROOM \nJanek keys open the arms locker in his wardroom. Unlocks automatic pistols from their rack one by one, and hands them to Stillwell and Kamarov. \nHYPERSLEEP COMPARTMENT \nHolloway's body lies frozen in his hypersleep freezer, blue with frost. The horrific wound yawning in his chest. \nWatts enters. Cleaned up. She opens the freezer. Her hand caresses Holloway's cold cheek tenderly. Slides over his collarbone - lies flat on his chest above his awful wound. \nGlasse enters. Reacts in dismay. Tries to pull her back. \nGLASSE You don't want to see that... \nShe turns on him fiercely. \nWATTS I want to understand. \nINT. MESS ROOM - DAWN \nThe entire complement of the ship gathers for an emergency meeting. Janek at the head of the hall. Glasse, Downs, Brick, Stillwell, and Kamarov seated with pistols on their hips. \nTo one side: Vickers with Captain Shepherd and Vigoda. \nJANEK All right! Listen up. I expect you all know what... \nWatts enters. They all stare at her, knowing what she's been through. With averted eyes she crosses the room. Sits alone. \nJANEK (CONT'D) We've got some kind of parasite aboard ship. \nVICKERS I suggest you kill it. \nDOWNS There's a bright idea. \nKAMAROV Show us where it is, lady. We just spent five hours looking for the damn thing. \nWATTS We found Engineers who died like Martin. \nSilence. They all turn to look at her. \nWATTS (CONT'D) Explosive wounds in the chest. Whatever killed Martin is the same thing that killed the Engineers a thousand years ago. \nSTILLWELL Jesus. \nWATTS But not all the Engineers died that way. The others were torn apart. Slashed to pieces. \nA murmur among the men as the implications of that sink in. Even Vickers is disconcerted. \nJANEK We're a modular ship. Self-contained life-support and power in every section. I say put the ship in orbit. Vent every compartment to space. Sit in vacuum at twenty degrees Kelvin for a week. Kill anything. \nDOWNS Then what? \nSTILLWELL Straight home, man. \nVICKERS This ship doesn't lift until our work's done. \nShe joins Janek at the head of the room. Shepherd and Vigoda flank her, rifles slung. The soldiers scan the room, meeting each man's eyes. The quiet threat is unmistakable. \nJANEK Are you serious? \nVICKERS We spent years and billions of dollars getting here. The technology we came for is in our hands. We just need a little more time. \nJANEK We're barely here three days and three men dead! \nVICKERS They were careless. \nJANEK Careless! \nAs the argument picks up heat, Watts slips out of the room. \nEXCURSION CHAMBER \nWatts, in a space suit, no helmet, opens Holloway's locker. \nShe pulls out the space suit he wore on the last day of his life. HOLLOWAY stenciled on the chest. Her fingers linger in its folds as if she could soak up some last trace of him. \nShe pulls the tracking chip from the chestplate of his suit. \nPlugs the chip into a map unit. The holographic map lights up. The legend in the corner reads MARTIN HOLLOWAY. \nA wandering path shows Holloway's final exploration. Markers on the map denote his photographs, field notes and scans. \nWatts touches a marker. One of Holloway's field notes plays: \nHOLLOWAY (V.O.) (FILTERED) Seven dead Engineers all facing the same way. Going where? Jocelyn's right, we don't see the big picture yet. Another level below me. I'm going down. \n", "test2_true": "A hunting party convenes: Card and Vigoda in combat coveralls with submachine guns; Downs, Kamarov and Stillwell wearing tool belts and pistols. \nThe soldiers carry map units, squinting at the plan of the unfamiliar ship: decks upon decks. \nCARD Vigoda, take Kamarov and work the number one accessway. I'll work number three with Downs and Stillwell. \nDOWNS (REBELLIOUS) You in charge now? \nCARD Tactical op. \nKAMAROV Yeah, well, Stillwell's the ventilation specialist, and life support's that way. Downs is electrics and the regulators are that way. \nVigoda grins wryly. Card glowers. They switch corridors. \nINT. PYRAMID WORKSITE \nRavel and Chance toil away at their dissection of the terraforming pyramid. Ray stands sentry. \nDAVID is nowhere to be seen. \nWatts rolls up in a rover and gets out. Heads for the ramp to the catacombs below. Ravel and Chance watch her pass without comment and return to their work. \nINT. MAGELLAN - SERVICE DECK - DAY \nKamarov and Vigoda, standing in front of an open vent, are in a full-fledged argument. \nKAMAROV You got the rifle. But you want ME to stick my head in the hole. \nVIGODA We grunts don't know nothing about ships, right? \nKAMAROV What's the damn gun for if you're gonna stand behind me the whole time? \nVigoda grins. \nVIGODA I kill whatever kills you. \nKAMAROV Funny. You take this vent, funny guy. I'll be on four. \nINT. PYRAMID - RAMP \nWatts descends alone into the lower passages below the pyramid. A tiny figure in the vast darkness. \nShe holds her map unit as a pilgrim holds a bible: a guide in the darkness. Holloway's name and course in shining symbols. She follows his path into the unknown. \nINT. MAGELLAN - MAINTENANCE BAY - DAY \nKamarov carries a stepladder into a utilitarian steel compartment. Drops the ladder under an air vent and steps up. \nHe pulls a powered wrench from his belt. With the wrench cocked like a hammer, he eases up and peers cautiously through the vent with a flashlight. Nothing to see. \nHe snorts. Removes the vent cover. Feels around inside. \nHe gasps in shock. Pulls out an atmosphere sensor that's been bitten in half. He takes his comm handset off his belt. \nKAMAROV (INTO HANDSET) I got more damage on four. \nHe hangs the handset on his belt. Takes one last look into the vent. Squints curiously. Reaches deep inside. \nA hiss inside the vent. Kamarov whips his flashlight up, peering inside. Snatches his arm back - \n- but something snatches him faster. \nAn unseen force drags Kamarov's right arm into the vent with hideous strength. He cries out in pain. \nHe drops his light. Tries to reach his pistol with his left hand. It's on his right hip. He can't reach across. \nHe braces his head against the vent's edge. Clenches his teeth and strains. \nA horrific YANK drags his head and arm together into the vent. They barely fit: he loses some skin on the way in. His feet come off the stepladder. He struggles on tip-toe. \nHorrific force collapses Kamarov's shoulder. Bones crack. The thing in the vent drags him through that hole he doesn't fit through. By the time his ribs are in he stops screaming. \nHis body disappears into the hole. Hips, legs, boots. \nBRIDGE \nJanek stands staring out at the barren moon. The Bridge INTERCOM SQUAWKS: \nBRICK (V.O.) Captain! \nJANEK Brick. What you got? \nBRICK (V.O.) It's Kamarov. \nENGINEERING DECK - ATMOSPHERE PLANT \nThe Magellan's life support center. A deep rumble of ventilation fans. \nJanek and stands beside Brick, Glasse, Downs and Stillwell. Shepherd and Vigoda look on from the doorway. \nIn front of them, an eight-inch metal duct has been cut open. Kamarov is stuffed inside, dead and broken: limbs folded, drenched in blood. A human plug in a pipe. \nINT. CATACOMBS \nWatts moves through the darkness with her map unit. Her headlamp sweeping nervously. \n", "test2_id": 1375, "test3_input": "A CLATTER behind her makes her spin: but it's only a spherical mapping probe, bumbling through the dark. \nShe walks on - \nHOLLOWAY (O.S.) (FILTERED) Jocelyn! \nThe voice transfixes her where she stands, a look of holy dread on her face. Shivering, she prowls toward the sound. \nXENOMORPH INCUBATOR \nWatts enters a new chamber, looking around in astonishment. The domed ceiling is honeycombed with cells like a beehive. Grotesque molluscoid organisms are secreted in them - their vile orifices cinched tightly shut. \nWatts stumbles on something: looking down, she sees a helmet. Picks it up. The stenciled label reads HOLLOWAY. The clear visor has been melted through by a powerful acid. \nShe looks up: a tracheal airshaft curves up into the dark. \nAn electric CRACKLE. A flare of blue light makes Watts leap back against the wall. \nHolloway falls out of overhead shaft and crashes to the floor. He lies in pain, barely conscious. Blue and luminous, a holographic ghost. \nWatts stares, paralyzed. The ghost gasps out a word: \nHOLLOWAY Jocelyn! \nHolloway's headlamp shines on the molluscoid right overhead: the beam awakens the organism. Its sphincter mouth dilates. \nA soft white octopoid FACEHUGGER descends on a quivering rope of mucus. Sprawls slitheringly over his clear visor. \nAcid HISSES. Smoke rises from the glass. \nThe vision vanishes in a sizzle of static. Watts huddles against the wall, gasping. \nIn the beam of her flashlight, the FACEHUGGER lies dead, legs curled in. \nShe looks up. Sees the open molluscoid above where Holloway lay. The other molluscoids not yet opened in their cells. \nTerror. She steals out of the chamber. \nLOWER CORRIDOR \nWatts emerges into a hallway. Leans against the wall, wide- eyed. Panting with the horror of what she's seen. \nShe glances left and right. Jumpy now. \nAll is silent. She lifts the map unit. A trace leads off into the dark. If Holloway's course before was direct and clear, now it is a meandering thread. A drunkard's walk. \nINT. MAGELLAN - CORRIDOR \nJanek pulls his communicator from his belt as he strides along. Punches a control. \nHis voice reverberates over the ship's public address system. \nJANEK All hands, duty stations. Ready for flight. The Magellan is lifting. \nVickers pursues him down the corridor, shouting. \nVICKERS Captain. Captain! \nBRIDGE \nJanek strides onto the Bridge, Vickers a terrier on his heels. But something in the faces of his men stops him cold. \nGlasse and Brick look stricken. \nJANEK What is it? \nGLASSE Nav computer's not responding. \"Access denied.\" \nIn disbelief, Janek strides to his Captain's chair. Taps controls. What he sees takes the wind out of him. He stares at Vickers in outrage and violation. \nJANEK What have you done to my ship? \nVickers is legitimately shocked. She shakes her head. \nVICKERS Nothing. What's wrong? \nINT. CATACOMBS - UNDERGROUND HANGAR \nA circular chamber of stunning size - a thousand feet across. Its lofty ceiling flat and segmented, designed to open. Watts follows her map into the space in awe. \nDominating the hangar is a ship: the vast horseshoe-shaped vessel familiar from the original film. We will come to know it as the JUGGERNAUT. It's at rest on its landing gear. Skeletal gangways slanting up to its three massive doors. \nWatts glances at her map: Holloway's holographic trace leads right up the gangway into the ship. She goes. \nPILOT CHAMBER \nWatts passes through a circular space with a high domed ceiling. A green glow emanates from grooves in the floor. \nIn the center of the chamber: a PILOT'S CHAIR. \nA mechanical throne built to giant scale. Its seat segmented like an armadillo's back. Tubes and conduits poised and waiting for some connection. The chair is empty. \nAbove the chair, a massive telescope-like apparatus juts into the air, its function unknowable. \nNAVIGATION CHAMBER \n", "test3_true": "A console, nearly five feet high and broad as a dance floor, dominates the room. \nFour immense coffin-like cockpits are built into the console. In each of these a NAVIGATOR - an Engineer - lies long dead. \nBut the real spectacle is overhead. The ORRERY: \nThe barrel-vaulted ceiling is traced with circular arches of some exotic alloy, as if to trace celestial courses. \nThe air above the console is filled with spheres of light. They are nearly still: but close study reveals them all to be in motion, drifting with the movements of the cosmos. \nWatts stares at the Orrery in amazement. Somewhere among those heavenly spheres is Earth. Somewhere perhaps the homeworld of the Engineers themselves. \nA bizarre sound: a section of blank wall suddenly unravels itself, becoming an open door. DAVID walks in, his hand raised in command. He clearly caused the door to open. \nWATTS DAVID. \nDAVID Dr. Watts. I didn't expect you. Do you know what this is? \nWatts points at the door DAVID just opened. \nWATTS How did you do that? \nA flicker of disappointment in the android's face. Contempt. \nDAVID Ah. You don't see. (HE SMILES) I call this ship the Juggernaut. Chariot of the Gods. (MORE) \nDAVID (CONT'D) This is the navigation computer, for want of a better term. But it's much more than that. It seems to hold the observable universe in its memory. \nHe gestures in the air: the spheres reconfigure themselves at his command, swarming and zooming. \nWatts stares at DAVID, conflicted: her desire for information warring with the agenda that brought her here. \nWATTS Their homeworld. Do you see where the Engineers come from? \nDAVID There are safeguards on that data. It's toward the galactic center. Sagittarius Arm. \nWATTS DAVID. The creature that killed Martin. There are thousands of them under the pyramid. Hatcheries. \nDAVID I know. \nWATTS (SHOCKED) Those things wiped out the Engineers on this moon. \nDAVID I've succeeded in connecting with the Juggernaut's systems, Dr. Watts. I know a great deal today I didn't know yesterday. I'm on the verge of activating more systems. Archives. \nWATTS (HORRIFIED) You're turning things on? This site should be sealed. Evacuated. \nDAVID Would Holloway have walked away from this? There's no greater work I can imagine. \nWATTS It's too dangerous. \nDAVID Only for the ignorant. Dr. Watts. I've read your file. Your intelligence scores are even higher than Professor Holloway's. But he had a kind of courage. An audacity of imagination. If you could find that in yourself... \nWatts stares at him, realization growing in her eyes. DAVID is off the reservation. \nWATTS If your owner gives you a direct order, you have to obey. Don't you? \nShe's got his attention now. DAVID goes rigid. \nWATTS (CONT'D) I can have Vickers pull you out. \nDAVID looks at her with something like contempt. \nDAVID I was given two operating protocols for this mission. I was to render you every assistance - until you discovered what Vickers would call a \"game-changing technology.\" I was given a specific list. Then I was to go to protocol two. \nThere's an edge in his voice that scares her. \nWATTS What's protocol two? \nDAVID Under protocol two I was to make sure that you and Holloway never spoke to anyone about this place. Various acceptable ways of making sure of that. I was given a list. \nWatts loses her nerve. She heads for the door. \nDAVID (CONT'D) You're all so stupid. \nThe door begins to knit itself closed in front of her. \nWatts gasps in shock - at the malice in DAVID's voice as much as the closing door. She dives out. Just in time. \nVAULTED PASSAGE \nWatts runs. \nBehind her, the door bursts open again. With superhuman speed, DAVID comes after her. He runs like a demon, his legs steel pistons. Caroming off of walls. \nHe closes the distance in seconds. Slaps Watts against the wall, shattering her helmet's visor. She falls, dazed. \nDAVID Stupid and slow. \nINT. JUGGERNAUT - EGG CHAMBER \nWatts awakens. Her helmet is gone. \nDAVID is dragging her across the floor - into a huge cargo hold full of Alien eggs. The wide trench holding hundreds of eggs under a membrane of light: an evolution of the molluscoids Watts saw before. Armored, hardened, darker. \nWATTS DAVID. What are you doing? \n", "test3_id": 1376}

KYLE'S MOTHER COME ON! 
The parents all head out the door- 
EXT. HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS 
The doors to the hospital swing open, and the parents march out into the street, singing in unison as they go. 
PARENTS (Singing) Something must be done! Something's gotta give! This world has become a bitch in which we have no desire to live! 
Cars come screeching to a halt as the parents sing in the middle of the road. People start honking their horns in frustration. 
KENNY'S MOTHER My boy could have become a doctor Or a lawyer rich and true Instead he burned up like a piggy on a bar-b-que! 
KYLE'S MOTHER We will fight for children's rights in memory of your son! 
PARENTS We can't just stand here singing! Something must be done! 
Cars are now smashing into each other, and flying off the road to people's deaths, as the music number has taken over the busy intersection. 
PARENTS We've pushed and pushed it to the edge And now the time has come! Something's gotta change! It's time to buy a gun! We can't just stand here singing No we can't just stand here singing No we can't just stand here singing! Something must be done!!! 
A few more cars careen off and explode into flames as if ending the song with a borage of fireworks. 
INT. OPERATING ROOM - 
The boys gather around Kenny's lifeless body. 
CARTMAN (Dazed) I bet him he couldn't do it... I bet him a hundred dollars! 
KYLE Come on, Cartman. It's not your fault. 
CARTMAN No, I know. I'm just fucking STOKED I don't have to pay him! 
KYLE Oh. 
The boys walk out, leaving Kenny's corpse behind. We can still hear the boys voices as they exit. 
KYLE (O.S.) I can't believe he's dead. 
CARTMAN (O.S.) Yeah, I'm having total deja vu right now. Like this has all happened before... 
After they leave, PUSH IN to Kenny's dead body, which is left all alone on the operating table. 
The camera continues to zoom in to Kenny's face... 
ZOOM IN on Kenny's dead face. We pass into his thoughs... 
FLASH!! 
EXT. SPACE - 
Kenny's body is floating through a great void. A PEACEFUL SONG plays as he soars upwards to the heavens. 
*note - except for Kenny's little construction paper body, this entire sequence should be done in 3D CGI. 
Ahead of him, Kenny can see a great white light. It appears warm and inviting. 
Now Kenny notices large beautiful breasts bobbing up and down in the heavens. He reaches out to touch them. 
Kenny blissfully floats upward toward the bright light and bobbing breasts. The music crescendos as Kenny gets almost close enough to the light to touch it. 
Just then, a huge, electronic sign pops up. 'Access Denied'. 
Suddenly, Kenny goes spiraling downward. The song changes to a MINISTRY type number as Kenny's surroundings start to become darker and more twisted. 
Kenny's hapless spirit enters a horrifying red tunnel, filled with flames and heat. 
KENNY Mph rmph rm! 
Burning souls SCREAM and CRY all around Kenny, as his body plunges into what is now obviously the depths of hell. 
Kenny passes images of Hitler, John Wayne Gacy, hunger and disease as he continues through the twisting tunnel. 
He then passes images of Jimmy Stewart and Gandhi. All of whom are opportunely locked in hell for all eternity. 
EXT. MOVIE THEATRE - DAY 
The same ticket guy from before is at the ticket booth. The marquee still reads 'Terrance and Phillip' but a huge sticker has been placed over it that reads 'banned'. 
The boys stand underneath the marquee looking baffled. 
STAN How can they do this? 
KYLE It isn't fair! 
CARTMAN Well, Terrance and Phillip are on Conan O'Brian tonight, we could at least go watch that. 
The boys hang their heads and walks away. 
The ticket guy suddenly hears a bunch of commotion. He sees a mob of angry mothers, led by Kyle's mother. 
KYLE'S MOTHER THIS must be him, officer! This is the scum that sold R rated tickets to children! 
TICKET GUY What?! Jesus Christ, I didn't mean to! 
Barbrady slaps handcuffs on the freaked out teen. 
OFFICER BARBRADY You can explain downtown! 
TICKET GUY (Getting dragged away) Oh shit! Hey it's not MY fault! You should arrest those pervert Canadians! 
KYLE'S MOTHER Oh we will, Mr. Scumbag... We will... 
EXT. CARTMAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Establishing. 
INT. CARTMAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
The boys are sitting on Cartman's couch watching TV.

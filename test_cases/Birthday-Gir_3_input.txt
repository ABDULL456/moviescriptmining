Alexei and Yuri shout at each other. Nadia begins crying. 
YURI Sit down please. 
John sits across the table from Nadia. 
JOHN Tell him to stop and let her go, and we'll talk. 
The kettle boils. Alexei takes the kettle and holds it over Nadia's head. 
John springs up. 
JOHN Put the fucking kettle down. 
YURI John. 
JOHN Put the fucking kettle down. Tell, Yuri, tell him put it down or I'm going to make him. 
Yuri translates -- Alexei replies. 
YURI He says you scare him so much he must go to the toilet in his trousers. John, he is a soldier. A trained killer. We must do what he says. 
JOHN What? What does he want? 
Alexei speaks. 
JOHN What did he say? Tell me! 
YURI He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry. 
JOHN What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ? 
YURI He wants money. 
JOHN Tell him to put the kettle down and I'll give him money. 
Yuri translates this for Alexei. Alexei has a reply. 
YURI He wants a lot of money. 
JOHN I'll give him money. Tell him to put the... 
YURI He wants the money from your bank. 
JOHN I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there. 
YURI You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank. 
JOHN I've got eight hundred pounds. Oh Jesus. 
The penny drops. 
JOHN Oh Jesus. 
YURI He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not. 
JOHN Oh Jesus. Of course I can't. 
Alexei doesn't need the translation he tilts the kettle, and a small amount of boiling water trickles onto Nadia's hair. She screams through the gag. 
John tries to reach across to her but Alexei draws the knife and holds it to his face. 
JOHN Just leave her alone. 
YURI I'm so sorry. 
JOHN Leave her alone. 
CLOSE UP On Nadia's terrified eyes, imploring John to help her.

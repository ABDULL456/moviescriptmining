ABBY Do I what? 
MIKE You know... (under his breath) Flick the bean? 
ABBY What bean? 
Mike throws her a look. Abby catches on.

ABBY (CONT'D) Ewww, gross. That's what you call it? 
MIKE No, I call it masturbating, but I thought it would offend your delicate lady-like sensibilities. (beat) So... how often do you flick it? 
ABBY                                           * How often do you flick it?                               * 
MIKE                                           * You only want me to answer that so                       * you can picture me flicking mine                         * while you flick yours.                                   * 
ABBY                                           * Trust me, I would never think about                      * you while I'm flicking it. Not                           * that I would ever do -- that.                            * 
MIKE                                         * Never?                                                   * 
Abby looks away haughtily.                                         * 
ABBY I find it impersonal.                                    * 
MIKE What could be more personal? 
ABBY I just don't think of myself that way. 
MIKE Well, you need to start. Because if you don't want to have sex with you, why the hell should Colin? 
61   EXT. ABBY'S CONDO - NIGHT                                     61 
Abby opens the door to find a gift bag on her doorstep, with a card that reads: "This present isn't for you. It's for your bean. Love Mike." 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 
62   INT. ABBY'S CONDO - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                           62 
Abby sits on the couch staring at a box of ELECTRIC UNDERWEAR. 
She opens the box, dumping out a pair of underwear and a REMOTE CONTROL. When she turns on the remote the underwear VIBRATES, startling her. She turns it off. 
63   INT. ABBY'S CONDO - BEDROOM - NIGHT                               63 
Abby checks herself out in the mirror. Now in the underwear. She downs a glass of wine, sits on the bed and picks up the remote. She turns it on. Nothing happens. She tries again. Nothing. 
ABBY Great. 
Abby smacks the remote a few times. The DOORBELL rings. 
ABBY (CONT'D) (shouting) Who is it? 
MIKE (0.S.) It's Mike! 
ABBY (frowning) One second -- 
Abby quickly throws on her skirt and hurries toward the living room. 
64   INT. ABBY'S CONDO - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                           64 
Abby heads toward the door, but quickly realizes she's still holding the remote. She tosses it in her purse, then opens the door. 
Mike stands there out of breath, dressed in a suit. 
MIKE You have to come with me. 
ABBY Where? 
MIKE My dinner with Corporate. I don't want to fuck it up.

ABBY I can't. I have a date with Colin. 
MIKE We'll pick him up on the way. 
ABBY Mike, I'm not going on your dinner. 
MIKE So, if it doesn't go well and they cut the segment and the ratings go back down to negative fourteen and they cancel the show, you're cool with that? 
Abby thinks a moment, then -- 
ABBY Let me get my purse. 
65   EXT. COLIN'S CONDO - NIGHT                                        65 
Colin opens the door to find Abby standing there. 
COLIN Hey, you're early --

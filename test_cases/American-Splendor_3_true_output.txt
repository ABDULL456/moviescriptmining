HARVEY Alright... Be careful. I love you, baby. 
They kiss. Harvey grudgingly puts her bags in the car. He watches as the cab pulls away. 
REAL HARVEY (V.O.) It was later that night when I first found the lump. 
INT. HARVEY'S BEDROOM - 1980'S - NIGHT 
Wearing only his shorts, Harvey lies alone in the communal futon, flipping through a book. He reaches into his underwear to scratch his nuts. 
Suddenly he stops. He feels something odd... 
For a moment he just freezes. His eyes register panic. 
REAL HARVEY (V.O.) I was determined to put it outta my mind until Joyce got back. Easier said than done. 
CUT TO: 
INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - 1980'S - DAY 
An enraged HARVEY fights with his co-worker MIGUEL. 
HARVEY What do I care! Just gimme the chart already! 
MIGUEL What is your problem today?! 
HARVEY Look, Miguel! I just don't wanna keep comin' back here for it, okay?! 
MIGUEL Harvey, that patient's due t'be admitted a week from now! Why do you always have to be picking fights with everybody? 
HARVEY (yelling) How many times do we gotta go through the same bullshit. Just gimme the fuckin' chart! 
Offended, Miguel storms off. 
MIGUEL We'll see what the doctor says about this. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HARVEY'S LIVING ROOM - 1980'S - NIGHT 
Alone and slumped over his table, HARVEY draws comic ideas with stick figures. Nothing's coming to him. He looks like he's in anguish. 
Frustrated, Harvey crumbles the idea and throws it on the floor. He knocks over a chair. 
INT. HARVEY'S BEDROOM - 1980'S - DAY 
He tosses and turns in bed. No way he's sleeping. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HARVEY'S LIVING ROOM - 1980'S - DAY 
HARVEY is yelling into the telephone. It is a bad connection. 
HARVEY (loudly into phone) Whadya mean? Another two weeks? Ya gotta come home some time! Hello? DAMNIT! 
CUT TO: 
INT. BACK STAGE - NBC STUDIOS - 1980'S - DAY 
Without Joyce, a surly Harvey waits in the wings for his introduction. He sneaks a peek as Letterman finishes up the "stupid pet tricks" segment. We hear dogs barking and audience laughter. 
LETTERMAN REGULAR (O.S.) And there you have it, folks! Another enlightening episode of Stupid Pet Tricks! 
REAL HARVEY (V.O.) I was startin' ta lose it. Between the lump, the loneliness -- I felt like everything wuz closin' in on me. And with Joyce over there savin' the world, I never felt more like a sell-out hack in my life. 
LETTERMAN REGULAR (O.S.) Y'know ladies and gentlemen, when Thoreau wrote that most men lead lives of quiet depression, he obviously had not met our first guest, who happens to lead a life of whining desperation... 
Harvey clenches his fists.

{"train": "THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON \nWritten by \nEric Roth \nBased on the short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald \nAs all things do, it begins in the dark. EYES blink open. Blue eyes. The first thing they see is a WOMAN near 40, standing looking out a window, watching the wind blowing, rattling a window. \nA WOMAN'S (V.O.) What are you looking at? \nCAROLINE The wind, Mother... They say a hurricane is on its way... You've been asleep... I was waiting to see you... \n1   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT          1 \nNow we see we're in a hospital room with layers of white enamel paint trying without success to hide the years... An old WOMAN, past 80, withered, still regal with a green turban around her bald head is propped by pillows, her blue eyes looking out at us from her bed... She's connected to an intravenous for sustenance and a morphine drip... Her name, is DAISY FULLER. She speaks with a Southern lilt. \nDAISY If it wasn't for hurricanes we wouldn't have a hurricane season. \nCAROLINE I've forgotten what the weather can be like here. I've lived with four seasons so many years now. \nWe see a young Black Woman, a \"caregiver,\" DOROTHY BAKER, in a corner, thumbing a magazine, with one eye at the window... \nDOROTHY BAKER I saw on the news they're predicting trouble... \nDAISY 1928 they stacked people like firewood to close a hole in a levee. \nBut Daisy has other things on her mind... murmuring... \n(CONTINUED) \n1   CONTINUED:                                                      1 \nDAISY (CONT'D) It all runs together... like a fingerpainting... I feel like I'm on a boat, drifting... \nCAROLINE (tenderly) Can I do anything for you, Mother? Make anything easier? \nDAISY Hmmm. There is nothing to do, Caroline. This is what it is... I'm finding it harder to keep my eyes open... my mouth all filled with cotton... \nAnd agitated, feeling confined, she scratches at her nightgown as if it were sticking to her... she starts to take it off... Dorothy gets up and straightens it for her. \nDOROTHY BAKER There, there, Miss Daisy... you'll scratch yourself to ribbons... (to Caroline) It's their way of letting go... (the finality) ...prob'ly today. \nCaroline is well aware of it, but the words, her admonition of death being so close at hand, makes everything even more present... \nCAROLINE Do you want more medication, Mother? The doctor said you can have all you want. \nDaisy is quiet, looking into the distance. Caroline, seeking closure, sits on the bed with her and starts to cry. Daisy puts her thin arms around her daughter, comforting her. \nCAROLINE (CONT'D) A friend told me she never had a chance to say goodbye to her mother. (grateful to have the chance) I wanted to thank you, Mother, for bringing me into this world. For raising me so well. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n1   CONTINUED: (2)                                              1 CAROLINE (CONT'D) I wanted to tell you how much you've meant to me. I'm going to miss you so much... \nThey hold each other for some time... They separate... And there's an awkwardness they have nothing left to talk about... nothing left to say to each other... a hole in their relationship... Caroline fills it with the eternal question... \nCAROLINE (CONT'D) Are you afraid? \nDAISY Curious.   What comes next... \nShe winces at some physical pain. \nDOROTHY BAKER The pain's coming more steadily... Her breathing will falter soon... No need for her to suffer.. \nShe raises the morphine level... Daisy closes her eyes... drifting with the morphine... and a thought, a dream, a sound, crosses her mind... and she says... \nDAISY They built that train station in 1918. Your father was there the day it opened... He said a tuba band was playing...Oom-pah-pah... \n2   EXT. THE NEW TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1918         2 \nAnd we see a TUBA BAND is playing while a ribbon cutting ceremony is taking place across the steps of the new TRAIN STATION... \nDAISY Oom-pah-pah, oom-pah-pah...The finest clockmaker in all of the South built that clock... \n3   INT. CLOCKMAKER'S SHOP, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1917           3 \nWe see an old French Quarter storefront with an endless array of clocks and watches... \nDAISY'S (V.O.) His name was Mr. Gateau. Mr. Cake. \n3A. \n4   INT. THE HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT       4 \nThe slightest of smiles crosses Daisy's lips... saying to herself again... \"Mr. Cake...\" \n5   INT. CLOCKMAKER'S SHOP, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT       5 \nWe see a diminutive man in a frock coat with small, delicate hands, \"Mr. Cake,\" working in his downstairs workshop. More than a few clocks stroke midnight, a handsome Creole Woman comes into the workshop... \n(CONTINUED) \n5   CONTINUED:                                                     5 \nDAISY'S (V.O.) He was married to a Creole of Evangeline Parish and they had a son. \nTaking his arm, she helps him up to show him to his bed. \nDAISY'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) Did I mention, Mr. Gateau was from birth, absolutely blind. \n6   INT. CLOCKMAKER'S SHOP, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1917              6 \n...The clockmaker his fine hands blindly working... \nDAISY'S (V.O.) And when their son came of age, like boys will do, he joined the army. They saw him off at the old train station. \n7   EXT. OLD TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1917                7 \nAn old wooden barn of a building. Their son, hugging his parents, getting on a flatbed train crowded with other soldiers, pulling away... Mr. Gateau, blindly waving his hat goodbye to his son... \nDAISY'S (V.O.) Oh how he worked, for months he did nothing but work on the clock for the great train station. \n8   INT. WORKSHOP BELOW THE CLOCKMAKER'S HOME - NIGHT, 1918        8 \nThe sound of clocks constant ticking. Mr. Gateau at work... \nDAISY'S (V.O.) One day a letter came... \nBlanche comes into the workshop... a letter in her hand... She reads to her blind husband... \nBLANCHE DEVEREUX \"I am sorry to inform you that your son was killed fighting for his country, at the battle of the Marne. In the death of Sgt. Martin Gateau I lose one of my most trusted men. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n8    CONTINUED:                                                     8 BLANCHE DEVEREUX (CONT'D) When I informed members of our company he had fallen, on every face could be seen the mark of sorrow... ...we were in hope the Lord would spare him to return home together... Alas this was not to be. I send along his pants, shirt, cavalry pin, kerchief, and haircomb.\" \nDAISY (V.O.) Mr. Gateau, done for the night, went up to his bed. \nMr. Gateau, blindly feeling his way up the stairs... \nDAISY'S (V.O.) And their son came home. \n9    EXT. OLD TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1918                9 \nWe see \"Mr. Cake\" in his familiar hat, his wife holding his arm, standing among the rows of coffins. \nDAISY'S (V.O.) They buried him where the Gateau family had been buried for a hundred and seven years... \nCaroline shrugs.   She looks through the \"book...\" \nCAROLINE Some pages seem to be torn out here... \nShe discovers inside... \nCAROLINE (CONT'D) There's an old streetcar token. \nShe gives it to her mother, folding her hand around it. But Daisy is somewhere else, looking out the window... \nDAISY That clock... Just kept going, year after year after year... \n32   INT. \"NEW\" TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - ANOTHER DAY, 1925    32 \nAnd we see \"Mr. Cake's\" clock with its cherubs pushing the \"hands of progress,\" still marking time backwards... The year is now, \"1925...\" \n33   INT. THE NOLAN HOUSE - DINING ROOM, NEW ORLEANS -            33 EVENING, 1925 \nBENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) \"...I didn't know I was a child. I thought I was like everyone else who lived there, an old man, in my \"golden years.\" \nThe boarders eating dinner. Queenie, in a white uniform... along with Tizzy, wearing a chef's hat and apron, helping her serve. We move across the ancient faces... until we come to one particular face... Wearing eyeglasses now... but the same wrinkled face we've come to know... the face of a very old man... \n(CONTINUED) \n33   CONTINUED:                                                  33 \nThe face of Benjamin Button, when he should normally be a six-year-old. He's sitting in a wheelchair now... small, shrunken, hunched with age, legs and hands crippled with arthritis... Eyeglasses are just one addition... a hearing aid... a bulky apparatus of its time, is in one ear... But if we look even closer we can see there are sprouts of hair... wisps of white... what would be the last hair for some... seem to be growing in... As we watch him eat, he uses his fork like a child might, banging it just for the hell of it making noise... \nQUEENIE Stop bangin' that fork... (fixing it in his arthritic hand) It's for eating, not for playin' with... And use your napkin, please Mr. Benjamin... \nAnd he does as he's told... A staff member helps one of the old men, feeding him... Benjamin just another old man having dinner with his contemporaries. \n34   EXT. THE PORCH, NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1925      34 \nA line of old people in rockers. Benjamin, like any six- year-old, bored, wheels his chair back and forth, between them... until one of the oldsters, who has had enough, sticks his cane in the spokes of his wheelchair, making him come to an abrupt stop... Benjamin, sitting with the other oldsters on the porch... the old people rocking... Sounds drift from the street beyond the wall... children playing... people talking... \nBENJAMIN BUTTON What's there? \nNobody says anything, rocking. Benjamin, eternally curious needing to know, suddenly wheels himself precariously to the very edge of the porch where the wall is lower and he just sees the street... children running on the street, playing... carriages dropping people off for a party... He leans forward to get an even better view... When Queenie suddenly grabs him... \nQUEENIE Benjamin! That's dangerous... Come back here...! \n...Rolling his wheelchair away from the edge to the safety of the old people... out of sight of the street... \n35   INT. QUEENIE'S ROOM - NIGHT, 1925                            35 \nThe small room with the small window. We see Benjamin in a bed made on the floor... Queenie in her bed... \nBENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) I loved her very much. She was my mother. \nAnd he reaches to hold her hand. She generously takes his hand... And they lay like that holding hands, Queenie in bed, her \"son\", the \"old man\" on the floor... \nBENJAMIN BUTTON Somedays I feel like I'm different from the day before... \nQUEENIE Everybody feels different about themselves one way or another. We're all goin' the same way, just taking different roads to get there... You're on your own road, Benjamin. \nBENJAMIN BUTTON How much longer do I have to live, Mother? \nQUEENIE Just be thankful you got what you're given. You already here longer than you supposed to be. \nWe see the door quietly open, Tizzy coming in... \nBENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Some nights, I would have to sleep alone. \nHe looks at Benjamin, his signal to pick him up, carrying him out of the room, sitting him in his wheelchair, Tizzy going back down into the room to be with Queenie... shutting the door... \n36   INT. THE PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE, LATE AT NIGHT, 1925            36 \nAn Old Woman's fallen fast asleep in an easy chair, a book on her lap. Benjamin sitting alone in his wheelchair, listening to the sounds of the house. \n(CONTINUED) \n36   CONTINUED:                                                        36 \nBENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) I didn't mind. I would listen to the house breathing. All the people sleeping. I felt safe. \nBe he still wants to know \"What's over there?\" He wheels himself over to sit at the window looking outside... looking at the streetlights, the world beyond the gate... trying to see what's dangerous... \nBENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) It was a place of great routine... Every morning at 5:30, no matter the weather... General Winslow, U.S. Army Retired... raised the flag... \n37   EXT. THE FRONT LAWN, NOLAN HOUSE - MORNING, 1925                  37 \nAnd we see the very elderly General Winslow, doing just that... raising the flag in a downpour, only... he's naked. And as Queenie comes running across the lawn with a coat for him. There's the sound of SOMEONE SINGING OPERA... \nBENJAMIN BUTTON (V.O.) Mrs. Sybil Wagner, once a noted opera singer... well, she'd sing, Wagner... \n38   INT. MRS. WAGNER'S ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - MORNING, 1925              38 \nWe see a Victrola playing, Mrs. Wagner in her nightgown at a window singing with the musical accompaniment at the top of her lungs... while, down the hall we see Queenie giving Benjamin a bath... massaging his poor crippled legs... \nQUEENIE We're gonna put some life into these old sticks for you... get you walkin'... \nBENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Breakfast was served promptly at six. \n39   INT. THE KITCHEN, NOLAN HOUSE - MORNING, 1925                     39 \nWe see Benjamin in his wheelchair, under Tizzy's tutelage, learning to cook... and simultaneously, to read... \n(CONTINUED) \n39   CONTINUED:                                            39 \nTIZZY How we doin'?

KITCHEN, NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT, 1925                      40 \nTizzy washing dishes...Benjamin working with him... putting away cans... reading from one of the labels... \nAnd we see Benjamin coming into the kitchen... Tizzy busy preparing lunch... Benjamin stops, seeing a tiny African man, his back to us, surrounded by old people standing on the lawn... He hears him telling them... \nNGUNDA OTI ... My first wife and I are captured by neighbor tribe, cannibals... \nThe old people shrink at the mention... \nNGUNDA OTI (CONT'D) I escaped across the river... \nAN OLD WOMAN (wide eyed) You escaped cannibals? \nNGUNDA OTI My wife, she can't swim, so she eaten. \nTIZZY (telling Benjamin) That's Mr. Oti... He's an acquaintance of an acquaintance of mine...he'll be stayin' with us in the staff quarters for awhile... \nNGUNDA OTI (telling old people) ...Second wife stepped on viper and dies... (jocular) It was bad luck to be married to Mr. Oti. \nThey laugh. \nNGUNDA OTI (CONT'D) I am captured with six others by Baschiele tribe. They sell us to a big white man... \nHe instinctively turns and sees Benjamin standing in the window watching him. When Mr. Oti spots him he quickly moves out of the window out of sight. \n47C   INT. THE PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE - ANOTHER TIME, 1927            47C \nWe see Benjamin lying on the floor by the stairs playing with some metal army men... when Mr. Oti's distinctive laugh, his voice, drifts up from under the stairs... Benjamin, getting his canes, goes to look... Mr. Oti, standing under the stairs in an alcove with some of the help, telling them his life story... but it's a completely different tone... a mockery of white people and their insanity... \nNGUNDA OTI The Big White Man brings us to St. Louis, where they make our village at the 1904 World's Fair... They have us livin' in these little huts like we're livin' in Africa... people behind bars staring at us... we told not to look at them... to just go about our normal lives... what the hell they talkin' about... ? \nThey all laugh... \nNGUNDA OTI (CONT'D) At night we're done bein' \"savages...\" we go over the wall into The Rosebud... we drank and laughed until the sun come up... and then we savages again... \nThey nod enjoying the idea... And as Mr. Oti senses Benjamin's presence, turning... Benjamin retreating on his canes as fast as he can back up the stairs... \n47D   INT. DINING ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY, 1927            47D \nBenjamin sitting at the dining room table reading an oversized book of \"Imaginary Beings...\" He senses a presence... and Mr. Oti sits down across from him. \nNGUNDA OTI I hear you not so old as you looking.

This is just how I am. \nMr. Oti looks out at the street. \nNGUNDA OTI You want to get a cold root beer? \nBENJAMIN (an echo) It's dangerous. \nNGUNDA OTI Who said that? \nHe gets up ready to go. Benjamin hesitates. He can see Queenie busy leaning out a window banging dust from a rug. \nNGUNDA OTI (CONT'D) (last chance) ...Come on little man... \nDespite knowing the consequences he takes up his canes and follows Ngunda outside... \n48    OMIT                                                            48 \n49    EXT.

Mr. Oti taking a slug from a flask... A group of school children nearby can't take their eyes off the two of them... Mr. Oti takes his wallet out, taking out a folded piece of newspaper, showing it to Benjamin... \"Bushman shares cage with park apes.\" \nBENJAMIN What's it like living in a cage? \nNGUNDA OTI It stinks. The monkeys, they do some tricks... I throw spear... I wrestle with Kowali, she is orangutan... They have me file my teeth like a cannibal... \nHe shows him his teeth filed into points like a cannibal... \nNGUNDA OTI (CONT'D) When I'm not playing with monkeys - - they want me to run to bars in my cage with teeth to scare little children... \nAnd he suddenly jumps up and does just that, charging with his teeth bared at the school children...

When suddenly a sheet is pulled back and Daisy's grandmother is standing there. \nGRANDMA FULLER What are you doing under there? Who's idea was this candle? \nShe angrily blows it out... and... to Daisy... taking her by the arm... \nGRANDMA FULLER (CONT'D) It's after midnight, you come right out here and get back up to bed...! (and for Benjamin, but saying it to Daisy) You are not to be playing together! Play with people your own age...! (moving her along) Now, you come back to bed, young lady...! You're too young to be wandering around in the night by yourself... (and a last word to Benjamin) You should be ashamed of yourself! \nAnd they're gone... Benjamin left sitting along under the sheets. There's a slight sound and he sees Queenie, in her nightgown, standing in the doorway... \nQUEENIE You are a different child... a man child. People aren't going to understand how different you are. \nBENJAMIN (forlorn) What's wrong with me, Mother? \nQUEENIE God hasn't said yet. Now, back to bed and behave yourself. \nHe crosses up the back stairs with the aid of his cane, and Mr. Oti, like a spectre, is sitting on one end of the back steps smoking a cigarette, drinking form his flask. He looks at Benjamin as he goes by. \n(CONTINUED) \n60   CONTINUED: (3)                                               60 \nNGUNDA OTI (takes a drink) You get used to it... \nQUEENIE (V.O.)

DAWS (CONT'D) Once, when I was crossing the road to get the mail... \nAnd we see that, the man peacefully crossing a country road to get the mail, getting hit by lightning...

Caroline sits back down looking   at her mother...Daisy opens her eyes... they look at each   other... Caroline knowing Daisy wants to hear the sound   of her voice... \nCAROLINE (taking up the book) The next page says... \nDaisy shuts her eyes... \n(CONTINUED) \n70   CONTINUED: (2)                                               70 \nBENJAMIN (V.O.) ...Queenie would let me go with Mr. Daws to Bridge City..To watch the boats go up and down the river... \n71   EXT.

For some reason none of the able-bodied men needing work respond... \nCAPT. MIKE What's wrong, nobody wants to get their hands dirty...!

He crosses through the empty bar, into an old KITCHEN... He looks for tea... Puts water in a kettle... As he watches the kettle boil... Elizabeth, her arms folded across her chest as if she were chilled, stands by the door... Benjamin, without asking, takes a cup for her... \nBENJAMIN (CONT'D) Milk...? Honey...? \nELIZABETH ABBOTT Some honey, thank you. \nHe finds a large honey jar... and seeing some dead flies in with the sweet syrup he asks... \nBENJAMIN Do you like flies with your tea? \nShe smiles...for the first time... A thin smile... He starts to stir the tea... Elizabeth stopping him... \nELIZABETH ABBOTT You must let it steep for a minute... \n139   INT. BENJAMIN'S ROOM, \"WINTER PALACE\" LATER, 1941               139 \nBenjamin unlocking the door to his room. An ENVELOPE has been left under the door, he opens it. \nBENJAMIN'S (V.O.) She had left a note. She wrote, \"it was nice to have met you.\" That was it. \nAnd as he stands holding the letter in his room at the small Russian hotel: \nBENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) And so, I went to war. \n140   EXT. TUGBOAT, ATLANTIC OCEAN, SOMEWHERE - NIGHT, 1941           140 \nThe men on the tug on a dark gray sea.... \nBENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)

(CONT'D) across the high seas... If there was a war, we didn't see it... \nAnd what seemed exciting, the idea of war... is tedious... The \"Chelsea\" towing a strange hulking shape on the dark, empty sea... \nBENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) There was a man assigned with us... The Chief Gunner loved the Navy, and most of all, he loved America. \nTHE MAN'S (V.O.) There is no other country in the world...! When YOU spell America, A.M.E.R.I.C.A. You're spelling freedom...! \nWe see the young Gunnery Mate, no more than nineteen... sitting at his post on a high caliber machine gun... ready to kick some enemy ass... \nBENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) His name was Dennis Smith and he was a full blooded Cherokee... His family had been in America for over five hundred years. \nDENNIS SMITH You have these pacifists. They say they won't fight on conscience. Where would we be if everybody decided to act according to their conscience? \nCAPT. MIKE (out his Window) Keeps it down, would you chief! \nHe goes back inside... And as they settle into their tasks.. \nDENNIS SMITH (on his gun, to himself, the last word) Where else can you shoot white people and get away with it... \nBenjamin's the only one around to hear him... \nBENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)

THE GALLEY - TUGBOAT - NIGHT                            142 \nThe men; including Dennis Smith, Pleasant Curtis, John Grimm, the \"fighting\" Brody twins, Benjamin serving them, silently eating dinner, rolling with endless rolling Ocean. Pleasant, not interested, just gets up and leaves. \nJOHN GRIMM There's something not normal about him. \nAs they silently eat, mostly bored... \nDENNIS SMITH (looking outside) Whoever said \"War is hell,\" doesn't know shit from shinola. \n143   EXT. TUGBOAT, ATLANTIC OCEAN -- ANOTHER NIGHT, 1942          143 \nWe see \"Chelsea,\" a steel tow line splayed out from its winch, towing a large crippled freighter across the ocean... \nBENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) We were towing a British freighter, that had gone dead in the water, 800 miles to Halifax for repair... \nWe see Benjamin and the crew watching the ship on the tow line run out some thousand feet behind them... \n144   INT. CREW QUARTER, TUGBOAT, ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT, 1942     144 \nWe see Benjamin awake in his bunk, Dennis Smith asleep in the bunk above him. \n(CONTINUED) \n144   CONTINUED:                                                     144 \nPleasant Curtis seemingly asleep in his bunk below him... Benjamin looking out at the black sea... and out of the silence Pleasant Curtis for the first time speaks... \nPLEASANT CURTIS I've been watching you. You seem trustworthy. If something happens to me... could you see this gets to my wife...? \nHe hands Benjamin a folded up handkerchief... \nBENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) He had given me all of his pay... he hadn't spent a dime of it... \nPLEASANT CURTIS If anything happens I want my family to know I was thinking about them, and if I could have, I'd have come back home. \nAnd that said he turns back over... And as Benjamin looks at the dark foreboding sea... suddenly: \nCAPT. MIKE (OVER) (calls) All hands on deck!!! \nThey bolt from their bunks... Going outside... \n145   EXT. TUGBOAT, ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT, 1942                     145 \nCaptain Mike stands by the wheelhouse... silently looking at the ocean... They see bodies of men, dead men, floating by them... One and two at first... then three and four... and then more and more until they are moving through a carpet of bodies... \nBENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) The war found us. \nAs they move through the water... their propeller literally chopping up bodies, to where they have to veritably shut their engines down... \nBENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D) A transport carrying 900 men had been hit by a torpedo. We were first to arrive at the scene... \nAnd as the tug arrives at the scene we see a TRANSPORT VESSEL, with a gaping hole in its midships sinking quickly... Fuel oil burning on the water... (CONTINUED) \n145   CONTINUED:                                                      145 \nIt's then we see the true horror of the men in the water... in the burning black oil... The transport boat silently slips into the water, disappearing under the sea... \n146   EXT. TUGBOAT - ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT, 1942                     146 \nAs the tug moves through the thick black smoke... Benjamin and the other crewmen watching along the rails... \nBENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) There wasn't a sound... \nExcept for the   lapping of water, and the tugboat's engines, there   isn't... just the silence of death... Something else   appears, doming onto the surface like a spectre... the   U-BOAT that had reeked this havoc... looking to see   the results... Captain Mike sees the sub... \nCAPT. MIKE (mad as hell) We can't run from the fucker and we can't hide...! There's only one thing we can do...! (and he shouts) Battle Stations...!!! \nThey run to their battle stations... \n147   INT. PILOT HOUSE, TUGBOAT, ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT, 1942         147 \nCaptain Mike at the wheel in the pilot house, turning the tug, furiously bearing down on the surfaced submarine... \n148   EXT. TUGBOAT, ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT, 1942                      148 \nA German submariner, on the conning tower, seeing the Tugboat, turns the .50 caliber machine gun on the tugboat... Benjamin is grazed by a bullet, his forehead cut open, bleeding... Despite the strafing the tug is relentless... The submarine, seeing it is about to be rammed tries to dive... but it's too late... the tugboat ramming the submarine... severing the U-Boat in half. The concussion of the collision has triggered a torpedo in the sinking submarine's torpedo shaft, the torpedo exploding, bursting the submarine, and in the process, blasting away under the stern of the tugboat... the men on the stern blown to pieces... Benjamin's literally thrown against the wheel house... He manages to get to his feet, the tug listing, beginning to sink... There's a man's voice... \n(CONTINUED) \n148   CONTINUED:                                                     148 \nAnd he sees, Captain Mike riddled with bullets, his body covered with blood... Benjamin bends to him... Captain Mike trembling as he lays dying... \nCAPT. MIKE Look at what they did! They shot holes in me! They shots the hell out my paintin'! \nHis body, his tattoos, like a ripped canvas, is riddled... \nCAPT. MIKE (CONT'D) You've seen a lot of things. Tell me it's going to be alright. \nBENJAMIN You're going to heaven Captain Mike. You're going to heaven. \n155   INT. THE PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT, 1945                    155 \nWe see Mr. Daws, much older now, asleep in an easy chair. \n(CONTINUED) \n155   CONTINUED:                                                     155 \nBenjamin standing at the familiar window, listening to the silence of the house... \nBENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) It's a funny thing about coming home. Smells the same. Looks the same. Feels the same. \nMr. Daws awakens.    Seeing Benjamin.   As if he never left. \nMR. DAWS Did I ever tell you I've been struck by lightning seven times. Once I was sitting in my truck listening to the radio. \nAnd we see just that Mr. Daws sitting in his truck getting belted by lightning. \nBENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) You realize what's changed, is you... \nWhile Benjamin stands locking out the window: \nBENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) And one evening, not long after I had been back... \n156   INT. THE NOLAN HOUSE - EARLY ONE EVENING, 1945                 156 \nWe see Benjamin, coming down the stairs. He happens to glance out a casement window... He slows... He can just see part of a TAXI coming to stop at the gate. He moves to the next landing...where he can see a figure is getting out of the cab... The figure of a young woman, wearing a beret, a dark coat and lace up boots... She strides through the gate... It takes us a moment to recognize her... the leggy thirteen year old girl is gone... replaced by a confident woman in her early twenties... with her red hair and her blue eyes she could be no one else but DAISY. Benjamin follows her progress, moving through the parlor, watching her out the screened windows... She moves gracefully past the porch with its swings... The unnamed woman's old dog, smelling her, comes to greet her... Daisy going around to the back of the house... Benjamin moving to the back door, and just as Daisy starts to knock... Benjamin opening it... Momentarily startled, she doesn't recognize him.... and asks... \n(CONTINUED) \n156   CONTINUED:                                                      156 \nDAISY Oh, excuse me... is Queenie here...? \nBENJAMIN Daisy... it's me, Benjamin. \nShe hardly can believe her eyes... \nDAISY Benjamin...Oh my God it's you... Of course it's you... \nThey embrace, and there's a moment when the touch is not just of old friends, but something different... and they both, in that moment recognize that things will never be the same... Daisy, over-hugging him... the way young people do... \nDAISY (CONT'D) Benjamin, how are you? It's been such a long time... There's so much I want to know... When did you come back? \nBENJAMIN Just a few weeks ago... \nDAISY I spoke to Queenie...she told me you were in the war...somewhere at sea... I was so worried about you... \nBENJAMIN (simply) I'm okay. \nBENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) When I had left she was a girl... and a woman had taken her place... \nBENJAMIN I can't get over you -- You are so lovely... \nDAISY You stopped writing. \nBENJAMIN I feel terrible about it...

What do they call it, \"Kismet\"? I read a book about a man named Edgar Cayce, a psychic, everything is predetermined...I like to think it's fate. What do you think, Benjamin? \nBENJAMIN I don't know how it works, but I'm sure glad it happened... \nThey inadvertently touch... the electricity of friction... both aware of the closeness... they move ever so slightly apart... \nDAISY (nervously) Have you been to New York...? It's just across the bridge from me... I can actually see the Empire State Building if I stand on my bed... Where have you been? Tell me everything. The last time you wrote you said you were in Russia? I always wanted to go to Russia... Is it as cold as they say...? You wrote you met somebody... did it work out...? \nBENJAMIN (holding out) Remember this? \nHe's comes upon the BOOK her grandmother had read to them, Rudyard Kipling's \"Just So.\" She sits on the bed... Benjamin sitting beside her... the two shoulder to shoulder... Daisy looking through the book... and reading.... \nDAISY ...This is the picture of Old Man Kangaroo at five in the afternoon...\" \nShe looks at him. \n(CONTINUED) \n159   CONTINUED: (2)                                              159 \nDAISY (CONT'D) You don't look like an old man anymore...You always said you were different... I think you must be... \nHe doesn't say anything. The two of them sitting with their backs to us like the old friends they are...They touch... acutely aware of their proximity and before it can go any further... \nBENJAMIN Are you hungry? Would you like to get something to eat? \nDAISY I would love that... \nAnd the moment's gone... \n160   EXT. A NEW ORLEANS STREET - NIGHT                           160 \n...And we see a taxi door being opened in slow motion... and Daisy, dressed for the night, glides out... a man helping her... and we see Benjamin a step behind getting out of the car... dressed to the nines... hair slicked, elegant... but nonetheless, a step behind... And we hear Daisy's voice, from somewhere else... \nDAISY'S (V.0.) ...I danced for a man named Ballenchine...He's a famous choreographer. He said I had a perfect line. They asked Ballenchine to describe what he did. He said, \"I'm a carpenter.\" Isn't that amazing? In one of his rehearsals a dancer fell. He put it into the production. Can you imagine that in a classical ballet? A dancer intentionally falling? He isn't the only one, Agnes DeMille, Lincoln Kirstein, Richard Pleasant, Lucia Chase...There's a whole new word for dance now, it's called abstract...\" \nThe door to the restaurant held open for Daisy... another man showing her inside...

Daisy as a maitre d in slow motion is showing her to a table... Men's, and even women's, eyes following her... \nDAISY'S (V.0.) ...They have torn up all the conventions... the straight up and down style, all the things that bound dancers...It's not about the formality of the dance...the classical structure...it's about what the dancer's feeling...there are no rules; the movement can be tense or relaxed, abrupt or flowing, carefree or somber, it may suggest love or hate, attraction or repulsion. The unexpected shifts of weight or energy -- not just to shock but to reinvent tradition...putting the familiar form to new and unexpected uses. It's so basic Just you alone with your body... \nAnd as he quietly looks at himself... There's a KNOCK on the door.. \nA MAN'S (V.0.) Benjamin... \nHe puts something on, and opens the door. And as if to underscore what he's just said, he sees THOMAS BUTTON in his fifties himself now, leaning on crutches, his feet bandaged, standing in the doorway... \nTHOMAS BUTTON Hello, Benjamin... Do you remember me? \nBENJAMIN Of course, Mr. Button... What happened to you? \nTHOMAS BUTTON My foot was infected... I'm afraid they had to remove it...

I told him about my life... about my time at war... and he told me how he had devoted his business to making buttons for the war effort... \nTHOMAS BUTTON The war has been kind to the button industry... we had gone from making forty thousand buttons a day to making two hundred and fifty thousand... We employed ten times the number of workers... We were operating around the clock... \nAnd he quiets... the sound of the busy restaurant... And after some moments Thomas tells him... \nTHOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) I don't know how much longer I have to live... \nBENJAMIN I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Button. \nAnd it seems like he is about to tell Benjamin the entire truth... but he can't bring himself and instead... \nTHOMAS BUTTON I don't have any people. I keep to myself. I -- I'm frightened. I hope you won't mind... but whenever it's possible... I would enjoy your company... \nBENJAMIN I'll do what I can, Mr. Button. \nThey quietly eat. \n(CONTINUED) \n165   CONTINUED: (2)                                                 165 \nTHOMAS BUTTON (after a beat) Tell me Benjamin, do you know anything about buttons? \nBENJAMIN Just what holds my shirt on. \n166   EXT.

BUTTON FACTORY, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1945                 167 \nWe see Thomas unlocking a door. \nTHOMAS BUTTON (has been telling him) ... comes from the French, \"bouton,\" meaning a bud, or any round object... \nThey come into a corridor.

WORK FLOOR, BUTTON FACTORY - NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT          168 \nThey walk through the quiet factory... \nTHOMAS BUTTON The practice of buttoning originated in the 13th century... when baggy clothing was replaced with more form-fitting clothes... \nThomas, on his crutches...past the lines of work benches... Mannequins in uniforms of the armed services... with their various gold and silver buttons... \nTHOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) Button's Buttons has been in our family for one hundred and twenty- four years. My grandfather was a tailor. He had a small shop in Richmond. After the Civil War he came to New Orleans.

And today... (a smile) I can't sew a stitch. \nBenjamin is interested, but the obvious question is... \nBENJAMIN It's all very interesting.   But what do you want from me? \nTHOMAS BUTTON I said, our family has been in the business for a hundred and twenty- four years. \nBENJAMIN Our family? \nAnd it's as if he has opened a flood gate... \nTHOMAS BUTTON You are my family. Benjamin, you are my son. \nAnd tears run down his anguished face... Benjamin's still... \nTHOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) I am so sorry not to have told you before... \nBenjamin hasn't moved. The words ring in his ears. \nTHOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) You were born the night the great war ended... Your mother died giving birth to you... I thought... I thought you were a monster... I left you on the back steps of a house... I promised your mother I'd make sure you were safe... I should never have abandoned you... \nBenjamin's dead quiet... He looks at this man, his father... \nBENJAMIN My mother? \n169   INT. THE BUTTON HOUSE, THE GARDEN DISTRICT - NIGHT, 1945       169 \nWe see Benjamin and Thomas in a hallway leading to the kitchen of the large house...

(and a group picture) All of the men in the family at the Lake House... (notices the date on it) 1915, three years before you were born. \nA photograph of an old man sitting in a wooden deck chair on the dock of a lake. \nTHOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) Your grandfather at the summer house on Lake Pontchartrain. When I was a boy I would love to wake up before anybody else and run down to the lake to watch the day begin. It was as if I was the only one alive. \nAnd they've come to a young Woman's photograph... who could only be Benjamin's mother. He stops... \nTHOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) I fell in love with her the first time I saw her. (beat) Your mother's name was Caroline Murphy. She was 20. She worked in your grandfather's kitchen...She was from Dublin... Her father, your maternal grandfather, was a chimney sweep... He died in the flu epidemic of 1900... Caroline came with her mother, two sisters, and four brothers in 1903 to live in New Orleans. \nThey stop at the kitchen door. \nTHOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) I would find reasons to go to the kitchen... just to look at her... \n(CONTINUED) \n169   CONTINUED:                                                  169 \nHe does just that... Looking through the round window into the empty kitchen... as if she was there those years ago... as if she was still there... \nTHOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) The happiest day of my life was April 25th, 1918 the day I married your mother. \nThey move along the hallway... Benjamin looking at the photographs... his bloodlines... After some moments: \nBENJAMIN Why didn't you tell me? \nTHOMAS BUTTON I made a mistake. \nBenjamin looks at him. \nThey're literally dumbfounded. \nBENJAMIN (CONT'D) Mrs. Sanderson will explain how everything works and will answer any of your questions... \nAnd with that he turns, walking away...Having \"given away the store\"... the workers in disbelief looking up at him... \nBENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)

A dressing room crowded with dancers changing out of their Costumes... He calls out... \nTHE MAN Daisy has company... \nWe can hear Daisy's name being said...Benjamin waiting... He sees Daisy, in a robe, coming through the room.... \nDAISY Somebody's looking for me?... \n...And she sees it's Benjamin. And rather than excited to see him... She's startled he's there... and not altogether pleased about him showing up... \nDAISY (CONT'D) Benjamin... What are you doing here? \nAnd he realizes, as most of us have in one love affair or another, whatever his expectations may have been, his fantasy, is not the reality... \nBENJAMIN I thought I'd come visit... spend some time with you if I could... \nDAISY I wish you would have called... You caught me by surprise. \nHe gives her the flowers, the daisies. \nBENJAMIN I couldn't take my eyes off of you... you were mesmerizing... \nDAISY That's so nice of you to say...

He's startled to see her... \nDAISY May I come in? \nBENJAMIN Please... \nShe comes inside...an awkward quiet... \nBENJAMIN (CONT'D) I don't know what I'm doing here...What I expected...? \nIt echoes how she's feeling being there...They stand not knowing what to say...And Daisy says, sadly... \nDAISY Nothing lasts. \nHe puts a finger to her lips.

It is not an infant's cry for succor, or a natural cry to exercise its new lungs... It's a deep, haunting cry from some primal soul... They all turn, and the room stills... listening as The BABY continues its mournful WAIL. Only Thomas goes to answer... The Baby in a basket, swaddled in a thick blanket, its face covered with cloth... Thomas goes to lift it, to see his son's face... \nMAID Mr. Button...! \nHe lifts the cloth anyway... He recoils... for he has seen some kind of horror... He makes the smallest of sounds, a whispered \"Ohhhh.\" And then he suddenly snatches up the swaddled baby -- running with it out of the room... downstairs... outside... \n22   EXT.

THE BACK OF AN OLD NEW ORLEANS HOUSE - NIGHT, 1918     24 \nHe comes to an old three-story house with a screened porch, VOICES from inside... PEOPLE TALKING and LAUGHING... The Baby, soothed by the soft yellow light, by the music of the voices, by the house itself -- stops its mournful cry. Thomas stops, catching his breath... He looks in through the back porch... the sounds of VOICES coming... Thomas quietly sets the baby on the back porch steps. He takes out every last dollar he has, tucking the money inside the Baby's blanket... We can just see the figures of two people coming from inside... Thomas knocks on the weathered screen door... And his decision made, he turns, moving away from the house, leaving his child behind. \nA WOMAN'S (V.O.) I could've sworn I heard somebody knockin'... \nWhen a young Black Woman, in a green dress, comes onto the porch... A thin, attractive woman, in her late 20s, with the sultry eyes of a lounge singer -- She's known as QUEENIE. She's followed by a handsome Black man, MR. WEATHERS -- that everyone calls TIZZY. She looks out the door, and not seeing anything... \nQUEENIE I guess not... \nShe stands for a moment taking in the night air... \nQUEENIE (CONT'D) The air smells sweet... \nAnd she sings to herself... a song from the time... \nTIZZY You look very handsome tonight, Ms. Queenie, handsome as I ever seen you...

I'll be right there, Mrs. Jameson... \nThe woman disappears inside.    Queenie, not anxious to go... \nQUEENIE (CONT'D) It sure is nice out here, Mr. Weathers... \nTIZZY Awful nice, Ms. Queenie... Come out back for a moment... take your mind away from things... \nHe pushes open the porch screen door... \nQUEENIE (smiles) Just a moment's time... \nHe offers her his hand... She takes it...

A fish crawl out of the river...? \nShe moves to it... pushes aside the blanket, and freezes. \nQUEENIE (CONT'D) God in heaven! \nIT IS THE VERY FIRST TIME WE HAVE SEEN THE BABY. What we see is the prominent bald head of any newborn... but it has the face, the wrinkled skin, the faded eyes, of an octogenarian. Indeed, if we didn't know any better, it would seem the newborn was a wrinkled decrepit sad-eyed old man... \nQUEENIE (CONT'D) My Goodness, the Lord did something here...! \nTIZZY Look like a milk wagon run over it... three times... and back... \nAnd they're both motionless, not quite sure what to do... \nTIZZY (CONT'D) I didn't see it layin' there... I hope I didn't hurt it none... steppin' on it like that... \nThe BABY won't stop its mournful cry... \nTIZZY (CONT'D) We best leave it to the police... I'll go -- \nQueenie hesitates... a longing. \nQUEENIE It's for sure nobody wanted to keep it... \nAnd making up her mind, she suddenly grabs up the crying baby, taking it inside...

An Old Age Home. We see Queenie moving quietly along a hallway, carrying the crying baby so as not to be seen. Tizzy, following her, still anxiously whispering after her... \nA WOMAN'S (V.O.) Where are you, Queenie...? \nQUEENIE Hold your water... (and to Tizzy) Go see to them. \nHe does what she asks.

His body is failing him before his life's begun. \nThey're still, looking at the strange baby. \nDOCTOR ROSE (CONT'D) Where did he come from? \nQUEENIE (after a beat) It's my sister's child... From Lafayette. She had an unfortunate adventure. (whispers) The poor child got the worse of it... came out white... \nDOCTOR ROSE There are places for 'unwanted' babies like these, Queenie...

But Elizabeth, flattered, takes it metaphorically... \nELIZABETH ABBOTT That's such a nice thing to say. You make me feel years younger, too. I wish I was. I would change so many things. I would undo all of my mistakes. \nBENJAMIN What mistakes? \nELIZABETH ABBOTT I kept waiting, thinking I would do something to change my circumstance... Do something... But I never did... It's an awful waste, you can never get it back... wasted time... \nThey're quiet.

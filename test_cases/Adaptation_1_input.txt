The phone rings. 
KAUFMAN (CONT'D) What? 
VALERIE (PHONE VOICE) Charlie?   It's Valerie. 
KAUFMAN Oh, hi.    Hi. Hey!   Hi! 
VALERIE (PHONE VOICE) Sorry to bug you. We were just talking about you, how excited we are. 
KAUFMAN Yeah, me too. 
VALERIE (PHONE VOICE) So it's coming along good? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
KAUFMAN It's good. It's complicated what I'm trying to do, but it's going very well. 
INT. ORLEAN'S APARTMENT - EVENING 
Orlean looks at a book called The Native Orchids of Florida. She comes to a photo of the ghost orchid glowing white on the page. Orlean's husband walks by with a cup of coffee, caresses her shoulder. She tenses slightly, smiles up at him apologetically. He smiles back sadly. She returns to the photo. A line of text catches her eye: "Should one be lucky enough to see a flower all else will seem eclipsed." Orlean closes the book, sits there. She dials the phone. 
LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE) Yeah. 
ORLEAN Hello, John? It's Susan. 
LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE) Susie-Q! 
ORLEAN So I was thinking it'd be good for the article for me to go into the Fakahatchee to see a ghost. Would you take me? 
LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE) I'd love to, but, hey, I'm banned for the next six months. Goddamn crucified me. Get one of them monkey-suited rangers to take you. 'Course, they wouldn't be able to locate a ghost, if it climbed off a tree and shoved itself up their ass. Hey, put that in the article. 
INT. EMPTY BEDROOM - MORNING 
A hollow-eyed Kaufman is zipping up a suitcase. 
KAUFMAN (calling off-screen) Travelling into the Fakahatchee, Donald, is a perfect metaphor for writing. I'm stepping into the confusion of the unknown. I'm taking the big risk here. 
INT. EMPTY LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Donald types cheerily on a lap-top computer at an ergonomic desk. Kaufman descends the stairs with his suitcase. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
KAUFMAN It's dark, dangerous, as dense as steel wool. I don't know if I'll come out alive, but if I do, I'll have something true to give the world. That's the difference between writing and aping some moron's "principles." 
Donald looks up from his work.      He hasn't been listening. 
DONALD Hey, Charles, I'm thinking of putting a song in. Y'know like when characters sing pop songs in their pajamas and dance around. I thought it might be a nice way to break the tension. So, try to think of a song about split personality... 
INT. AIRPLANE - MORNING 
Orlean sits in her seat and addresses the camera. 
ORLEAN You would have to want something very badly... 
INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT 
Kaufman reads The Orchid Thief. 
ORLEAN (V.O.) ... to go looking for it in the Fakahatchee Strand. 
He can't concentrate, closes the book and watches a stewardess tending to another passenger. 
INT. STUDIO APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Kaufman fixes a salad in the kitchenette. The door opens and the stewardess enters dragging her luggage on a little cart. 
KAUFMAN Hey!    How was Denver? 
STEWARDESS Oh, God, sweetie, I'm so glad to be home. 
She kisses him, looks lovingly at him. 
STEWARDESS (cont'd) Can I get you something to drink? 
INT. AIRPLANE BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Kaufman finishes jerking off, stands, pulls up his pants, adjusts himself, and exits the bathroom. 
INT. AIRPLANE - CONTINUOUS 
Kaufman steps out of the bathroom. The stewardess is there talking to another stewardess. She regards Kaufman blankly, then goes back to her conversation. He heads up the aisle. One of the stewardesses laughs. He tenses, takes his seat. 
INT. AIRPLANE - MORNING

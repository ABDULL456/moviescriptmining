MICHELLE God.    Sorry. 
Luke picks the cue ball up off the floor and sets it on the table. 
He sees them watching him. 
LUKE What? 
KEENAN Man, I'd be on the floor cryin' like a baby. 
LUKE No, I'm all right. 
Surprised, they return to the game. 
Michelle lines up the cue ball again, as Luke considers,... 
with a slow-dawning realization that something, somehow, just isn't right. 
He casually touches his hand to his pants. 
He pales slightly. 
LUKE (CONT'D) Would you excuse me a sec'? 
He looks to Keenan for help. 
AT THE BAR 
Sydney watches as Keenan and Luke cross the hall toward the back. 
She flags Jeremy. 
SYDNEY Jeremy! Bourbon. Fast! (a glance at Luke) Better give me the whole bottle. 
OUTSIDE MEN'S ROOM 
Luke tries the men's room door, locked. 
KEENAN In here. 
Keenan opens another door that leads them into a store room. Luke follows, with a look of concern. 
INSIDE STORE ROOM 
KEENAN (CONT'D) I mean, it was like a precision- guided missile. 
Luke unzips and gently digs in his trousers. 
He looks down, SHUDDERS,... 
LUKE Uh- ah- 
Luke's face CONTORTS, terrified. 
KEENAN I'll get some ice. 
Luke shakes his head "no," points toward his crotch, GASPS, barely able to make a sound... 
LUKE It's-!     Look! 
Keenan gives him a look, repelled, perplexed... 
KEENAN What? 
then takes a look,... 
His EYES GET HUGE. 
KEENAN (CONT'D) DUDE!!! 
Sydney BURSTS in with the bottle of bourbon. 
SYDNEY I was afraid a' this! (to Keenan) Make sure no one gets in!

AMOUN You can honor Boreas by the way you act from this moment forward. 
PERSEUS I'm no demigod, Tutor. I'm not even much of a human. 
AMOUN It is not your choice. You are what you are. Amor fati, Perseus. 'Love thy fate.' 
PERSEUS I do not believe my fate is to be half a God. No demigod could feel as confused as I do tonight. 
AMOUN Concentrate on the task before you. All answers will come with that. 
PERSEUS Tell me of the Cleon Desert Legion. 
AMOUN A fierce group. Trained to fight... Amoun's DESCRIPTION CONTINUES as we -- 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SIROQUE VALLEY - NIGHT 
SUPERIMPOSE: CLEON DESERT LEGION BIVOUAC, THE DISPUTED 
TERRITORIES The desert camp of the Legion is lit by torches. The LEGION SOLDIERS are handsome, powerful career warriors, going about their evening business -- eating, cleaning weapons, washing. 
AMOUN (V.0.) . behind enemy lines. A LOOKOUT peers into the dark desert, listening. Now he HEARS something, turns and shouts to another SENTRY: 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LOOKOUT The Night Patrol returns on the Gorge Road! That message is shouted along from Sentries to Guards in the camp. OUT IN THE DARKNESS on the dusty Gorge Road, a dozen Soldiers gallop in GROUND-SHAKING FORMATION toward the firelit encampment. 
AMOUN                                                       (V.0.) . They've been chasing Djinn Raiders in the mountains for years. 
PERSEUS                                                     (V.0.) Djinn Raiders? 
AMOUN (V.0.) Yes, Godly zealots, supposedly insane. They fight like Hades himself is keeping score... From the dark SURROUNDING DESERT, WE SEE the Night Patrol ride into camp and dismount. 
AMOUN                                                       (V.0.) .. That's how the Desert Legion came to be called 'God-slayers.' I'm not ashamed to say I'll be relieved to have their protection the rest of the way... Amoun's Voice FADES. TILT DOWN TO the barren, desert flats. Suddenly, a miracle transforms the moonlit 
SCRUB -- Strange, beautiful MAGENTA FLOWERS sprout magically where there had been only dirt and cacti. The LOTUS BLOSSOMS surround the camp. 
EXT. MOUNTAIN RIDGE (SIROQUE VALLEY) - NIGHT 
The Cleon camp is just twinkling lights from here on the mountain. Startlingly, a huge DEFORMED PAW/CLAW/HOOF scrapes onto a boulder. Pulling himself INTO VIEW in repulsive CLOSEUP -- Kalibos. (There, within his frightening visage, is the distinctive crooked scar we noticed on the jaw of Acrisius in his human form.) When his twisted body has gained purchase, he looks up the mountain. AN EERIE LIGHT illuminates his awestruck countenance. Above him -- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: -- Tiamat, ensconced in a natural throne of rock. Turning a Lotus blossom in her hand, she smiles on Kalibos, like a benevolent mother. 
TIAMAT My loyal friend. it is beneath you to stalk this band of infidels one by one. Events demand more decisive action. Kalibos' SPEECH is as tortured and deformed as his body -- 
KALIBOS Grorashnrd... I to be... ruler... rhodirs... made whole... sovfrenty... kingdom mine... 
TIAMAT Yes, Kalibos, the time is nigh when I restore you to your rightful form -- proud Acrisius. With me, your protector, on the throne of Olympos... the violator Zeus deposed. Kalibos reacts, with what must be satisfaction. 
TIAMAT Go down into this valley. See what I am building for you -- an army dangerous and fearless as you, their leader. 
EXT. CLEON LEGION BIVOUAC - PREDAWN 
Several Soldiers have been drawn from camp by the IRRESISTIBLE FRAGRANCE of the Lotus flowers. They pluck petals and chew them. The rest of the Legion filters out between the tents to take their fill of the drug. Kalibos watches the handsome, powerful warriors from across the field of Lotus blossoms. 
INT. THE BASILICA - ANDROMEDA'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT 
Peshet comes into the dark room and looks at the lump on Andromeda's bed. On instinct, she hurries to the bed and throws off the covers -- a pile of cushions, no Andromeda. Peshet races out. 
EXT. THE ACROPOLIS - NIGHT 
Peshet sprints through the RAIN, dodging the REFUGEES and CITIZENS like a cat, peering under each hood, searching for her mistress. 
EXT. THE ACROPOLIS - COVERED PLAZA - NIGHT 
On the plaza, a rabid throng of Refugees. Fantasos, the Revolutionary leader, exhorts the mob, surrounded by BODYGUARDS, including Agenor. As before, Fantasos seems to have actual hypnotic powers.

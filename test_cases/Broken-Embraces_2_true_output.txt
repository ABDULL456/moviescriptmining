Diego remains pensive for a moment. 
DIEGO I will not recriminate you... I think I like being Mateo's son (the son of a bitch) ... Speaking of, he called early this morning... 
JUDIT Who? 
DIEGO Mateo. At 8h. 
She looks at the clock and it's 11h. 
JUDIT What did he want? 
DIEGO For you to call him as soon as you could. 
JUDIT (Surprised, tense) That I call him? Why in the world have you not awakened me?! 
DIEGO Because, after what happened last night, you needed to sleep. He didn't say it was urgent. You can call him now. 
Judit grabs her son's phone, agitated once again, and dials Mateo's number. 
173. ALTERNATING BETWEEN JUDIT'S HOME. INT. DAY. 2008. 
174. PUERTA DE HIERRO MANSION. ERNESTO JUNIOR'S STUDY. INT. 
DAY. 2008. 
In the beginning the shot is close up and so we are not aware of where he is. All one can see is a bit of a curtain, out of focus. 
Phone conversation. 
JUDIT (Attempts to appear calm, since her confession her voice has a less authoritarian edge and is weaker) Diego has told me to call you. Are you OK? Do you need anything? (This is what she's most worried about.) 
MATEO (Almost with irony) I am not alright, Judit. And yes, I do need something... The forty thousand meters of negative we shot during my last film in order to edit it... I am at the home of Ernesto Junior and I just found out the material was destroyed in '94. I imagined something like this, I just didn't think it would have happened that soon... 
JUDIT (With urgency) Let me explain... 
MATEO (Cuts her off) No. I am in a hideous mood, Judit, and I don't want to take it out on you! 
JUDIT (Surprised and alarmed) What are you doing at Ernesto's house? 
The shot opens up, and we discover Ernesto Junior at the other end of the room, next to a 16mm camera (on a tripod) recording everything that Mateo says and does, while he searches around in some drawers. 
MATEO I think I am going to bribe him. We need money, I don't want Diego back at that damn bar. I want to pay Diego a salary, we need money and he has money to throw... 
175. PUERTA DE HIERRO MANSION. ERNESTO'S STUDY. INT. DAY. 2008. 
The studio has a different configuration than when his father lived, but we recognize the place nonetheless; when the father was alive the space served a different purpose. Ernesto looks at Mateo fearlessly, he is still determined to search, urgently, for something inside the drawers of a chest. The place is a pretty big mess. 
JUDIT Mateo, stop talking crazy! 
MATEO It is not craziness. I can't think of anyone else to blame for Magdalena's death. 
JUDIT My God! (She asks Diego to bring her the box of tranquilizers.) Wait a second... I have something to tell you. 
MATEO Let it be, you already said enough last night. 
JUDIT 
(She takes a pill and yells at him) Listen to me, Mateo! (As she raises her voice, she becomes dominant.) I was the production director, if you want to know anything about the footage, ask me! 
MATEO Since you insist, I will ask you. What do you have to tell me? 
JUDIT In effect, Ernesto Senior asked for it to be destroyed. 
MATEO In '94! Very shortly after the release of that aberration. 
JUDIT Yes. In any case, sooner or later the lab disposes of all the material... and that was many years ago. 
MATEO That's not anything that I don't already know. 
JUDIT As the film's producer I was the only one who had access to the lab... to all the material. After I gave the order to have everything destroyed, I intercepted it. And I kept it. I have all of it at home. 
MATEO You are lying to me. 
JUDIT I didn't tell you this last night because I didn't realize you wanted to edit it. I took everything, all the double takes, the internegative, the sound tapes... Everything! You can have it whenever you want! 
The silence on the other end of the line reassures her. 
MATEO That changes everything. 
JUDIT (Begs) Please, get out of that place, leave Ernesto alone. He had nothing to do with this. 
Mateo looks over at Ernesto Junior. The camera is still on its tripod, rolling. 
MATEO I am not so sure. He has yet to explain what he was doing in Lanzarote. I'll let you go, it seems he wants to talk... (Hangs up) 
Ernesto, finally, finds a DVD. He has it in his hand and brings it toward Mateo. (His hand enters into view on the screen of the 16mm camera). 
ERNESTO J. Here is a copy of "the making of". 
MATEO And why would I want that? I can't watch it! Plus, I'm not interested. 
Ernesto takes his hand and places the DVD softly onto it.

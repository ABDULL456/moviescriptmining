{"test1_input": "The second hand, the explosion: bodies flung into the air, arms, legs, white smoke, screams. \nBodies thrown outside, the doors unhinged, the windows broken, empty. \nThe people watch from their windows, the passersby move closer, they bend down to look at those who are writhing on the ground. \nAstonished and incredulous faces. No one speaks. Only screams and weeping. Sirens which are drawing nearer. Firemen and police arriving ... \n67\tMILK BAR. RUE D'ISLY. OUTSIDE. DAY. \nThe ambulance sirens on rue d'Isly, one car after another. \nAt the Milk Bar, the people go to the doors to look at the ambulances which are racing toward Place Bugeand. The sirens fade in the distance and move away. The jukebox is again loud: \"Brigitte Bardot, Bardot ...\" \nThe people re-enter the bar, chattering, to have their ap\u00e9ritifs. It is six fifty: the explosion. \n68 \tMILK BAR. EXPLOSION. OUTSIDE. DAY. \nThe jukebox is flung into the middle of the street. There is blood, strips of flesh, material, the same scene as at the Cafeteria; the white smoke and shouts, weeping, hysterical girls' screams. One of them no longer has an arm and runs around, howling despairingly; it is impossible to control her. The sound of sirens is heard again. The crowd of people, the firemen, police, ambulances all rush to the scene from Place Bugeand. \nThe ambulances arrive at rue Michelet. \nThey are already loaded with dead and wounded. The relatives of the wounded are forced to get out. The father of the child who was buying ice cream seems to be in a daze: he doesn't understand. \nThey pull him down by force. The child remains there, his blond head a clot of blood. \nThe policemen try to bring order to the chaos, are forced to shout, push, threaten. The wounded swarm around the ambulances. A Commissioner sends off the first one. \nCOMMISSIONER What time is it? \nPOLICEMAN A quarter to seven. \nThe Commissioner goes to the second ambulance, pulls down a man who is trying to enter by force, slams the door, and shouts to the driver. His face is pale and drawn; the veins of his neck are swollen. \nCOMMISSIONER Go away, for God's sake! \nThe auto leaves and now, the third explosion resounds in the distance. It is heard clearly and violently from the Mauretania section. \nThe Commissioner stops midway in his last gesture, and likewise, all the others, who are paralyzed with fright, incapable of taking action again, of accepting such reality for a third time. \nIn Place Bugeand, there also, the people are motionless. All of them are looking in the same direction. Their faces are alike in their terror, alike in their sense of impotence, alike in their deep sadness. \n69\tSTREET. EUROPEAN CITY. OUTSIDE. DAY. \nThe sun appears, then hides behind black clouds. There is a cool wind. It is ten in the morning, and the European city has its usual rapid and efficient rhythm of every day at this hour, only there is terror written on the face of every person. That same terror has remained, and suspicion, and despairing impotence. \nPatrols of soldiers and policemen move around the city, search Algerians and some Europeans, stop automobiles, trucks, buses, and trams that they block at both doors. \nAt the entrance to every shop, the owner searches every customer before letting him enter. \nHe does so politely with a drawn smile, and methodically rummages through every handbag, every package. \nSo too in the bars, in the offices, in workshops ... And now that it is already late afternoon, also outside the brothels, the cinemas, the theaters. \n70\tLEMONS STREET. OUTSIDE. SUNSET. \nA young Algerian boy thirteen or fourteen years old, wearing sandals without socks, trousers that reach to his ankles, walks quickly carrying a cardboard box tied with a cord. It is dusk. \nA European woman sees him pass in front of her, looks at him, and follows him with her glance. \nOn the sidewalk there are some youths. The woman points to the Algerian boy, says something. The traffic is heavy. Her words are unclear. One youth calls to the boy who is by now thirty feet away: \nYOUTH Hey, little rat ... \nThe boy turns around for a second, his face frightened, and quickens his step. The youths follow behind him and the boy begins to run. The youths too begin to run and others join them, people who are passing. They form a small mob and are shouting. The boy shoots into a sidestreet, drops his box, and races ahead. \nWhile some chase the boy, others stop around the box, make way, look for a policeman, a soldier, an officer. A circle continues to form around the box. A patrol arrives. One of the soldiers has a Geiger counter. He moves near the box, carefully placing the counter above it, then ceasing to be prudent, he takes his bayonette, cuts the cord, and tears open the box: lemons. \n71\tSTREET CORNER. OUTSIDE. SUNSET. \nThe boy has been cornered, surrounded, pinned down, kicked, hit with umbrellas, until he is exhausted and can no longer defend himself. He is no longer moving. He is lying on the ground, dead. The air is gray now, and slowly all the colors unite to form gray. Lights are lit in the city and contrast with the whiteness of the Casbah high above. The sky is still clear, the black profiles of the mountains, the straight coasts on the sea, the sea itself that seems to be land until it reaches the horizon where the moon rises between the clouds. \nSPEAKER \"Following a lengthy discussion, the General Assembly of the United Nations has decided its agenda for the forthcoming debates: \n(1) re-unification of Korea (2) disarmament (3) the Algerian question. \nColombia has proposed that only the first two points be discussed for the day. However, the Afro-Asian nations opposed, underlining the importance they attribute to the Algerian question ...\" \n72\tSEA-FRONT. OUTSIDE. DAY. JANUARY 10, 1957. \nThe European crowd applauds, their eyes aglow, their mouths wide open, shouting and yelling, their teeth flashing in the sun. Clapping of applause on the sea-front of Algiers. Children, are held up to see, waving small flags. The paratroopers of the Tenth Division march past. \n", "test1_true": "Massu and the authorities are standing on the balconies of the Prefecture building. \nThe paras are marching, their sleeves rolled up, their faces sunburned. Machine guns, bazookas, crew-cuts, the eyes of singing boys, silent steps, one battalion after another. \nThe dragon \"black berets\" pass by ... \nThe \"red berets\" of the 2nd Regiment of colonial paratroopers ... \n\"Les casquettes\" of the 3rd Regiment parade by; \"les hommes-peints,\" Mathieu's paras. \nColonel Mathieu is at the head of the regiment. He is tall, slender, over fifty. He has thinning gray hair, a lean face, blue eyes, and a wide forehead. His face is lined with many wrinkles. Were it not for the uniform, the weapons, his tanned skin, his manner of walking, and his energetic voice when giving orders, he wouldn't seem a soldier, but an intellectual. \nThe 3rd Regiment colonial paratroopers are now before the Commissioner. Mathieu turns his head slightly and: \nMATHIEU 3rd Regiment! Attention \u00e0 droite ... Droite! \nSPEAKER Family name: Mathieu; Name: Philippe; Born in Rennes May 3, 1906; Rank: Lieutenant Colonel; Schooling: Politechnique-degree in Engineering; Campaigns: Second World War, Anti-Nazi Resistance Movement, Italian Campaign, Indochinese War, Algerian War ... \n73\tVILLA HEADQUARTERS. INSIDE. DAY. \nIn a villa in the military headquarters, a reception room is visible through a large window on the first floor. There are about twenty officers seated in rows of chairs as if for a lecture. Mathieu is in front of them and he is speaking while standing next to a desk. At his back there is a blackboard, and near it, a large map with pyramid graphs, cells, arrows, crossmarks, and, above them, the title: STRUCTURE NLF AUTONOMOUS ZONE OF ALGIERS. \nMathieu's voice has nothing of the military and traditional. His tone is neither harsh nor cold, but rather kind and pleasing; from it emanates a superior authority imposed by reason and not by position. \nMATHIEU The result is that in the last two months, they have reached an average of 4.2 assaults per day, including aggression against individuals, and the explosions. Of course, the conditions of the problem are as usual: first, the adversary; second, the method to destroy him ... There are 80,000 Arabs in the Casbah. Are they all against us? We know they are not. In reality, it is only a small minority that dominates with terror and violence. This minority is our adversary and we must isolate and destroy it ... \nWhile speaking, he goes to the window, and pulls down the shade. He interrupts his speech, points to the rest of the window: \nMATHIEU Draw it down there too ... \nTwo or three officers stand up to perform the task. At the back of the room there is a movie projector. \nNext to it there is a para who is preparing to operate it. \nThe other shades are drawn, and gradually the room is darkened. \nMathieu, meanwhile, has resumed speaking: \nMATHIEU He is an adversary who shifts his position above and below the surface with highly commendable revolutionary methods and original tactics. ... He is an anonymous and unrecognizable enemy who mingles with thousands of others who resemble him. We find him everywhere: in the alleys of the Casbah; in the streets of the European city, and in working places. \nMathieu interrupts himself again and makes a signal to the back of the room which is completely darkened. \nMATHIEU Go ahead, Martin. \nMartin turns on the projector. On the white wall next to the map and graph appear pictures of the Casbah. There are the blockades, the barbed wire, the metal screens, the Algerians who exit and enter, the policemen and soldiers who examine documents and frisk someone. From time to time, close-ups of the pictures are shown, enlarged to the minutest details, close-ups of faces, motionless images that last only for a few seconds. \nMATHIEU Here is some film taken by the police. The cameras were hidden at the Casbah exits. They thought these films might be useful, and in fact they are useful in demonstrating the usefulness of certain methods. Or, at least, their inadequacy. \nHassiba is now seen and the soldiers who are wooing her, while she laughs, jokes, flirts in a provocative manner, and passes the blockade. \nMATHIEU I chose these films because they were shot in the hours preceding some recent terroristic assaults. And so, among all these Arabs, men and women, there are the ones responsible. But which ones are they? How can we recognize them? Controlling documents is ridiculous: one who has everything in order is most likely to be the terrorist. \nAn Algerian is being dragged away while protesting, kicking, and trying to free himself. And then the scene changes. There is another Casbah exit, and an Algerian who is being searched. \nMATHIEU (smiling) Note the intuition of the cameraman. He realized that in that box, there had to be something of interest, and he paused to focus it. \nThe picture is enlarged. The small box which the Algerian is carrying on his shoulder is seen in detail. It is opened. The box is swarming with snakes; the soldier who had wanted to examine it jumps backward. \nThe officers in the room burst into laughter. \nMATHIEU (laughing) Maybe the bomb was hidden right there, in a double bottom. Who knows? We'll never know. \nUsing the barrel of his machine gun, a soldier has closed the box. A snake has managed to jump out, and fallen to the ground. The people are terrified and move away. Others laugh, among them, Petit Omar, who seems to be an ordinary child enjoying himself. \nMATHIEU That's enough, Martin ... \nThe lights are again switched on in the room. Mathieu is again next to the desk, and waits a second until the buzz of comments subsides. \nMATHIEU We must start again from scratch. The only information that we have concerns the structure of the organization. And we shall begin from that ... \nHe takes a wooden pointer from the desk in order to illustrate the graph, while he speaks with the tone and precision of a university professor. \nMATHIEU It is a pyramid-like organization divided into a series of sectors. At the top of the pyramid is their General Staff. \nHe has moved near the blackboard, and taken some chalk, and slowly as he speaks, he illustrates his speech. \nMATHIEU The military commander responsible for the executive body finds the right man and nominates him to responsibility for a sector: number one. Number one in his turn, chooses another two: number two and number three ... And so they form the first triangle. \nHe has written high on the board a number one and below it, with some space between them, the numbers two and three. He unites the three numbers with lines and forms a triangle. \n", "test1_id": 2505, "test2_input": "Ben M'Hidi looks at him, smiling. \nBEN M'HIDI Why? Isn't it wise? \nKader smiles too, and repeats: \nKADER It isn't wise. \nAt the end of the terrace, there is a construction raised to a level with the stairs that lead to the floor below. There is a large room; through the open door, the lighted interior is visible. The walls have high brick baseboards, and at the bottom of one of the four walls there is a square opening that leads into a hiding place. The closure of the hiding place, a square of very thick wall, is placed to one side. Ali la Pointe is covering it with bricks. \nOn the other side of the room next to the door, there are some cement wash-basins, and a shed for rain water. Kader appears at the door. \nKADER Ali, you must accompany Ben M'Hidi to the Maison des Arbres. \nAli doesn't answer immediately. He finishes placing the last brick then turns to Kader. \nALI Why? Isn't he sleeping here? \nKADER No, it's better if he doesn't. The house is filled with new people. \nAli gets up, wipes his hands on his trousers, at the same time inspecting the work that he has just completed. \nALI Here's another one ready. What a hideout! It really looks like a wall. I'll dirty it a bit, and it's perfect. Want to give a look inside? \nKader has taken a machine gun from one of the basins, and he tosses it to Ali, who catches it. \nKADER No, go now. It's already late. \nThey go out on the terrace. Ali releases the catch of his machine gun so that the bullet slips into the barrel. \nKADER (to Ben M'Hidi) They are a family of militants from way back. Everything will work out well, you'll see ... C'mon, Ali, hurry up. \nBEN M'HIDI Alright. See you tomorrow. \nThey say good-bye, embracing one another. Ali has already climbed over the terrace wall, and has jumped to the next one. \nBen M'Hidi follows him; he is less agile and moves with a bit of trouble. \nFrom the parapet, Kader says to him: \nKADER Passing along the terraces only takes five minutes ... and with Ali la Pointe, you'll be safe ... \nWhile jumping, Ben M'Hidi loses his balance, and has to grab on to Ali to prevent himself from falling. \nBEN M'HIDI But it's he who won't be safe with me ... \nThe two figures move away from terrace to terrace, and disappear in the dark. \n86\tCASBAH VIEWS AND TERRACES. OUTSIDE. NIGHT. \nIn the dark in front of them, a metallic reflection is visible and the sharp and aggressive sound of an Algerian voice is heard. \nAli responds to the password. \nA youth steps out from the shadows. He too is carrying a machine gun, recognizes Ali, and greets him. Ali and Ben M'Hidi continue ... \n87\tMAISON DES ARBRES, TERRACE. OUTSIDE. NIGHT. \nUntil they arrive at a terrace which is separated from the next one by an alley about ten feet wide. \nALI Here it is ... we've arrived ... \nBen M'Hidi glances at the emptiness beneath them, looks at Ali, and takes a deep breath. \nBEN M'HIDI Not yet ... \nAli has climbed onto the parapet, looks around him concentrating attentively for a moment, and then jumps into the void, reaching the opposite side. He bends, searches for something in the dark, and lifts a type of gangplank. \nHe hands it over to Ben M'Hidi, and together they place it between the two terraces. \nALI Be careful now. Unless you know how it works, it's better if you sit on the plank and move forward like this ... \nBEN M'HIDI Let's try ... \nHe tries to stand up on the gangplank, but he lacks the necessary steadiness. He can't hold his balance. He does as Ali has advised him; he sits astride on the plank, and using the force of his arms, he pushes himself forward. He stops halfway to rest for a minute. \nBEN M'HIDI It's good nobody is following us ... \nALI It's a question of habit ... \nAnd when Ben M'Hidi is closer, Ali helps him to get down to the terrace. \n", "test2_true": "Without waiting for an answer, he moves toward the stairway that leads to the floor below; his movements are silent and graceful. \nBen M'Hidi leans out from the terrace, and looks toward the European city and the sea. At the port, two searchlights are lit, and their long bright rays move slowly toward the Casbah ... \nWhen Ali la Pointe returns, Ben M'Hidi is still leaning on the railing. He seems not to hear the sound of Ali's footsteps, or his voice. \nALI Everything's okay ... They're waiting for you ... \nAli moves near him, and Ben M'Hidi turns and looks at him. \nBEN M'HIDI What do you think of the strike, Ali? \nALI I think it'll be a success ... \nBEN M'HIDI Yes, I think so too ... It's been organized well ... But what will the French do? \nBoth the question, and the answer seem obvious to Ali. \nALI (shrugging) It's clear. They'll do everything possible to make it fail. \nBEN M'HIDI No, they'll do even more. We've given them the opportunity to do a lot more ... Do you understand what I mean? Starting tomorrow, they won't be groping in the dark any more; every shop and every worker who strikes will be a known enemy, a self-confessed criminal ... And they will be able to pass to the offensive. Have you thought of this? \nAli has listened attentively. The effort with which he is trying to ask himself the meaning of these words is visible on his face. \nALI (shaking his head) No ... \nBEN M'HIDI But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike. \nALI No, and neither were my men. \nBEN M'HIDI Why? \nALI Because they told us that we mustn't use weapons, now, when the time is right. \nBEN M'HIDI That's true ... Wars aren't won with terrorism, neither wars nor revolutions. Terrorism is a beginning but afterward, all the people must act ... This is the reason for the strike, and its necessity: to mobilize all Algerians, count them and measure their strength ... \nALI To show them to the UN, right? \nBEN M'HIDI (smiling slightly) Yes ... yes. The problem also involves the UN. I don't know what it's worth, but this way, we'll give the UN the possibility of evaluating our strength. \nAli breathes deeply, instinctively, unrestrainedly, Ben M'Hidi watches him, smiles, and says: \nBEN M'HIDI Do you know something Ali? Starting a revolution is hard, and it's even harder to continue it. Winning is hardest of all. But only afterward, when we have won, will the real hardships begin. \nHe pats Ali's back fondly with his hand and continues, smiling: \nBEN M'HIDI Anyway, there's still a lot to be done ... you aren't already tired, Ali, are you? \nAli looks at him, and without reacting to his irony: \nALI (with conviction) No! \n88 \tVARIOUS HOUSES. CASBAH. OUTSIDE. DAWN. JANUARY 28, 1957. \nIt is gray and smoky dawn, a slow reabsorption of the night, an opaque light which is diffused, sprayed, frozen, to transparency, and rediscovers its outlines and perspectives; and finally, the sun, golden light, awakens all Algiers. To the north, the sea. To the south, the mountains and the Casbah, situated halfway along the coast. The Casbah, still, inert, expectant, on this first day of the strike ... \nThe paratroopers are already at their places, one after another, at equal distances like links of a very long chain, strung through every alley, spreading to every sidestreet, twisting through the squares, climbing up the stairways, dividing, joining, and lengthening again. The silence is perfect; the camouflaged immobile forms seem to be part of the landscape. \nThen a brief and sharp hiss, a hundred whistles together. \nA signal releases the still forms: the attack begins. \nDoors are beaten down, shots, screams, rifle fire, machine gun fire; the doors opened or broken down; the courtyards, the houses, the rooms, invaded; the men who are trying to escape and who protest and try to save themselves. \nVOICES Of course ... I was just going to work ... \n89\tBEN M'HIDI'S HIDING PLACE. INSIDE. DAWN. \nBen M'Hidi is inside the hiding place. From outside, an old man helps him to place the square piece of wall over the entrance, and then, in the spaces between the bricks, he adds a paste of plaster mixed with coal dust. When the paras arrive, everything is in order. \nStill men are being seized, beaten, dragged; a cache of weapons; men pushed down the stairs: \nSOLDIERS Go on, go on, you little rats! Get to work! \n90\tCASBAH. STREETS. OUTSIDE. MORNING. \nWomen are clinging together after the beatings. \nSomeone is fleeing toward the terraces. We hear the deafening whirl of the helicopters flying against the wind, their cabin doors open, paras sitting on both sides with their legs dangling out, their machine guns on their knees, a loudspeaker for every helicopter, microphones turned on in such a way that the din of the motors is multiplied a hundred times. \n", "test2_id": 2506, "test3_input": "MOURAD Who is speaking? \nMATHIEU Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu. \nMOURAD We don't trust you, colonel. Come forward, show yourself. \nA moment of silence. \nMATHIEU I don't trust you either. First stand up so I can see you, and keep your hands still and well in sight. \nMourad hesitates an instant, glances at Ramel, then: \nMOURAD Okay. But we want your promise for a fair trial in writing. Give us a written statement, Mathieu, and then we'll surrender. \nMATHIEU How can I give you this statement? \nMOURAD We'll lower a basket from the window ... \nMATHIEU Okay, I'll make the statement in writing ... \nMourad shows his companion the two large time-bombs that are on the floor in front of him. He takes one, begins to prepare it, and regulates the mechanism. \nAt the same time, he tells Ramel in Arabic to go find the basket. \nRamel crawls past the doors which are all closed, and asks for a basket. \nA door opens and an old woman appears. She hands him a basket with its cord rolled up. \nMOURAD (without turning around) A newspaper too, or a piece of paper ... \nRamel brings him the basket and newspaper. Mourad has loaded the time- bomb mechanism, and the tic-toc sound is sharp and clear. \nNow he has to move the second hand. Mourad's hands do not tremble, his glance is attentive, concentrating. Ramel watches him without saying a word; his fear is obvious. \nWithout moving, his eyes glued to the bomb dial: \nMOURAD (loudly) Are you ready, colonel? \nMATHIEU Yes ... But let me first see you. \nMourad moves one of the clock hands to precede the other one by a minute. Immediately afterward he places the flat and rectangular bomb in the bottom of the basket. \nThe basket seems to be empty. The piece of newspaper protects its bottom. Mourad tells Ramel to get up, and he too gets up. Their machine guns are lying on the ground. Meanwhile, Mourad has begun to count to himself silently, his lips moving: one, two, three, four ... \nFrom the terrace, the paras can see Ramel and Mourad standing up not very far away, their empty hands resting near the basket on the railing. \nA para shouts: \nPARA We see them. You can come. \nMourad begins to lower the basket very slowly. \nMOURAD (counting) \nMathieu enters the courtyard together with an officer and other paras. He looks up toward the balcony, smiles, and shows them a folded piece of paper. \nMATHIEU Here it is ... you know that when I give my word, I keep it ... \nMourad does not answer, but looks at Mathieu as if to calculate the distance and time, and slows down even more the basket's descent. \nMathieu moves forward a few steps, as if to go for the basket that is hanging on the other side of the courtyard, but suddenly he seems perplexed for a second, and then changes his mind. He turns to the nearest para, and gives him the note. \nMATHIEU You go ... \nMourad's face has remained motionless. In his expression there is a shade of disappointment. He sees Mathieu retrace his steps toward the door, and is now surrounded by a group of paratroopers ... \nMOURAD (counting) \nThe basket has stopped moving two yards from the ground. In order to reach it, the para has to step over the corpses of his dead companions, his face hardens, he reaches the basket, and extending his arm, he throws in the note. The basket does not move; the para looks up. \nPARA (muttering) Hurry up, black bastard! \nMourad smiles at him, and mumbles something in Arabic, a phrase that he doesn't manage to finish, for now is heard -- the explosion. \n129\tRUE CATON 4. FATHIA'S HOUSE. INSIDE. NIGHT. SEPTEMBER 2. \nRue Caton number four. It is 11 p.m. A large, badly lit room is filled with paratroopers and one of them is now being carried away on a stretcher. Another three or four wounded are seated on the opposite side of the room and are waiting their turn to be carried away. \nTwo paras are by the door. They look out from time to time, and are attentive, ready, with machine guns clutched by their sides. \nOn the other side of the room opposite the door, the Algerians who live in the house are standing against the wall. Mathieu is in front of them, and he is asking a group of women: \n", "test3_true": "A woman about forty years old raises her eyes toward him. \nMATHIEU Is it you? \nThe woman nods yes. \nMATHIEU Go up the stairs, and tell Kader that if they don't surrender, we'll blow up everything ... Do you understand? \nThe woman again nods yes, and without waiting for more words, she moves toward the door, taciturn, silent. Mathieu follows her, he pushes past her. \nMATHIEU Try to convince him, if you care about your house ... Wait a minute ... Do you want to get killed? \nHe leans out the door and says loudly: \nMATHIEU Kader, look. Fathia is coming ... I wouldn't shoot ... \nThen he steps aside and lets the woman pass. \nMATHIEU Go on ... \nOutside the door, there is a small landing, then a steep stairway, and at the top, a corridor. Fathia climbs the stairs that are cluttered with empty magazines, with cartridge boxes. The walls are chipped from the shooting. The ceiling is parallel to the stairway at the same inclination, for part of its distance. But for the last few yards, it straightens out and lowers to become horizontal. \nThe floor of the hiding place is open. Inside are Zohra and Kader. \nFathia repeats to them in Arabic what Mathieu has said to her. \nKader listens to her then answers, he too in Arabic. Then he smiles. \nKADER Okay ... You can tell the colonel to blow up whatever he likes. Go on, now. \nFathia goes down the stairs, and reenters the room. \nFATHIA (to Mathieu) He said that you can blow up whatever you like ... \nShe, then, rejoins the other women. \nMathieu seems to be tired, he has lost weight, he is nervous. He turns to his men, and slowly as he gives the orders, the paras begin to move. \nMATHIEU Return to where the others are. Prepare the plastic. It should be placed on the ceiling of the stairway under the hiding place ... a long fuse rolled up ... Take cover ... keep shooting while you are working. Quickly! Clear the house ... Bring them outside, then check the rooms again ... Hurry up! \nKader gives Zohra a box of matches. She goes to the back of the hiding place where there is a bundle of papers. She lights them, then returns near to Kader who is inspecting the magazine of his machine gun. \nThere are only two shots left. The other empty magazines are scattered around. Kader turns to Zohra, and starts to speak, but suddenly his words are blurred by the sound of shots. \nKader and Zohra have to step back a little, because the shells are flashing at the edge of the opening. \nThe shooting stops. From the stairway, one end of a long fuse is thrown into the corridor. The other end is inserted into a plastic charge fastened to the ceiling of the stairway, under the hiding place. \nKader and Zohra can see two or three yards in front of them, below, into the corridor, where the end of the fuse is glowing and burning. \nKader too has lost weight, his beard is long. He looks at the fuse, then at Zohra. A second passes in silence. Now Zohra too looks at him, and Kader says calmly in his usual voice: \nKADER It doesn't do any good to die like this ... it doesn't help anybody ... \nHe leans out from the hiding place. \nKADER (shouting) Mathieu! If you give your word that you won't touch any of the other people in the house, we'll come out. \n130\tMILITARY CAR. INSIDE. NIGHT. \nInside a military automobile. \nIn the back seat, Mathieu is sitting next to Kader who is handcuffed. \nZohra is in the front seat, between the driver and a para who has in his hand a large regulation pistol. The interior is lighted by the headlights of a jeep which is following directly behind the auto a few yards. Silence. Mathieu looks hastily at Kader, who is staring straight in front of him, and appears to be sullen and downcast. \nThen Mathieu speaks in a pleasant tone, as if in friendly conversation. \nMATHIEU If you had let me blow you up, you would have disappointed me ... \nKader turns to him, and replies, trying to maintain his own voice at the same level of indifference: KADER Why? \nMATHIEU For many months, I've had your photo on my desk together with a dozen or so reports on you ... And naturally, I am under the illusion that I know you somewhat. You never seemed the type, Kader, inclined to performing useless actions. \nKader doesn't answer right away, then speaks slowly as if expressing the results of his doubts, a new point of view ... \nKADER You seem to be very satisfied to have taken me alive ... \nMATHIEU Of course I am. \n", "test3_id": 2507}

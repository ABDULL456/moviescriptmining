WHITACRE You know they needed to shave me for the tape recorder. They needed to... I'm a part... 
GINGER I need you at home, the kids need you to be their father. 
WHITACRE I'm doing all this for you and the kids. I didn't ask for this-- but I want to give this family everything. That's why I'm working so much. 
GINGER I don't know who you work for anymore, Mark. Do you? A beat. He smiles warmly at her. 
79 INTERIOR FBI DECATUR- DAY 79 Warm summer day-- out the window the smoke stacks of ADM send plumes of white smoke into the blue sky. Shepard and Herndon sit in their SHIRTSLEEVES transcribing tapes in the tiny office. There's a knock on the door. Shepard checks to see who it is through the eye-hole. Whitacre enters wearing the SAGE COLORED SUIT- full of confidence. 
WHITACRE Hey guys, I was in the neighborhood. I got some more tapes. 
SHEPARD Thanks, Mark. Come on in. 
WHITACRE And I've learned some important things recently. I've been told I'm probably going to be the next President of ADM. He glows. 
HERNDON Really? 
SHEPARD Who told you that? 
Draft: 1/15/03 72.

WHITACRE And that's not all. I'd say that ten of the products produced by ADM are price fixed. 
SHEPARD Ten? 
WHITACRE I would estimate that for all the companies involved, the total extra profit is in the range of 800 million to one billion dollars. That's just from the price-fixing. 
SHEPARD Can you tell us what products? Whitacre smiles-- he's got something else on his mind. 
WHITACRE You know, Brian, if all these companies are charged, they're going to be paying an awful lot in fines. Don't you think? 
SHEPARD I don't know, they might end up paying. But, nobody knows for sure how this will turn out. 
HERNDON We still need to get everyone together making an actual agreement before we have a case. 
WHITACRE Sure, sure I know that. But, I've taken a lot of risks and I need to think about my family. 
SHEPARD What do you mean? 
WHITACRE Well, I'd like it if, in their fine, ADM was ordered to pay me ten year's salary. 
SHEPARD Well, Mark... 
WHITACRE It's only fair. Also, one other thing. 
(MORE) 
Draft: 1/15/03 73. 
WHITACRE (CONT'D) I never expected this investigation would go on as long as it has. It's been almost two years and I think I should get total immunity if I agree to cooperate through the end. 
SHEPARD I can't grant you immunity Mark, you know that. Whitacre smiles wishfully like a big kid. Herndon senses that something's up. 
HERNDON Hey, Mark, it's kind of warm in here-- why don't you take off your jacket, sit down and we can talk about this. 
WHITACRE Oh, no, Bob, that's okay. Let me know if you want to reconsider. Whitacre leaves. Herndon looks at Shepard. 
SHEPARD What was that about? 
80 INTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION- MARK'S OFFICE- EVENING 80 Whitacre labels the tape of the FBI agents and tosses it in a box-- with other tapes. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) These floods out on the Mississippi, you have to think about these. It just looks like some boy scouts and sand bags on the news-right until you have your stock plummet because of crop losses... Then it looks like someone's knee deep in your kids college education looking for their photo albums.. .Brian doesn't understand stock options. He doesn't see what can happen if they take those away from me. 
$1 INTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION- MASTER BEDROOM- NIGHT 81 Ginger alone in bed at 3 AM during a rain storm. The regular patter of rain is punctuated by the sound of a SMALL ENGINE. She gets out of bed and goes to the window. 
Draft: 1/15/03 74. Whitacre stands in his bathrobe in the rain with the LEAF BLOWER. There's one wet leaf stuck to the pavement and he's focussed the full power of the blower on it but it's not going anywhere. Three deer stand like statues in the yard, oblivious to the rain. 
WHITACRE (V.O.) We got a deer problem here. They're in the corn, they're eating the small trees, they charge into the road. Too many deer. Take away all the predators and that's going to happen.. .No bears, no coyotes...So now you have all these deer-- weak and desperate. 
ANGLE ON THE DEER Close enough to hear the rain on their METAL BODIES. They are YARD STATUES. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) And then one gets sick and they all get sick. Because they're broke and hungry and they make mistakes. Who's fault is that? You can't blame the deer for not having predators... 
82 EXTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION DRIVEWAY- NIGHT/RAIN 82 Ginger approaches in her night gown under an umbrella. 
GINGER Mark, what are you doing? Whitacre can't tear himself away from the lone leaf. 
GINGER Come inside Mark, what's happening to you? She takes his arm and tries to lead him toward the house, but he turns on her. His eyes are filled with terror. She turns off the blower.

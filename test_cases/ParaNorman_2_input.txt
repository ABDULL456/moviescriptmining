Sheriff Hooper looks around and sees an awful lot of armed people beginning to bay for blood, and she sees trouble on her hands. 
SLOB GUY Ain't room for no more zombies in this town! Standing behind him, Teddy agrees with a slack-jawed 
MOAN. 
TEDDY Yeah. 
INT. STATION WAGON - NIGHT 
Perry drives into town in silence, his nose bloodied and stuffed with tissues. Sandra sits beside him and Sheriff Hooper is in the back seat, scouring the streets. 
SHERIFF HOOPER Would've been a quiet night too, if it hadn't been for those meddling kids. Huh! As Perry and Sandra exchange uneasy glances, Hooper suddenly points through the windshield to the riot in progress on Main Street. 
SHERIFF HOOPER (CONT'D) Sweet baby jinkies! 
EXT. MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS 
Perry brakes hard just a few feet in front of the advancing mob, moving menacingly en masse in pursuit of the fleeing Undead. Hooper bustles out of the car, making a beeline for Deputy Dwayne. Crystal turns and fires into the street, taking out a lightbulb over a store sign. A dog somewhere in the shadows YELPS and runs away. ParaNorman 63. 
105 CONTINUED: 105 Sheriff Hooper is outraged, and snatches the gun out of Crystal's hand. 
SHERIFF HOOPER What do you think you're doing, firing at civilians? That is for the police to do! 
DEPUTY DWAYNE It's okay Sheriff, we've only been shooting at the dead ones! It's the living dead, come to take us all to Hell! We gotta stop them before they get away! 
EXT. TOWN HALL - MOMENTS LATER 
In the alley down the side of the old Town Hall, the zombies tiptoe through the shadows. They look slightly the worse for wear; some have lost limbs, others have large holes in them. One has a toilet plunger stuck on her head. The Dead Judge looks up at the sky. The turgid supernatural storm RUMBLES closer, pressing down upon the nearby rooftops. The Judge motions to the other zombies to hurry, and grabs hold of the Town Hall's side door. He rips it open, and furtively motions the zombies to file inside. 
EXT. MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS 
SHERIFF HOOPER Move along now people, there isn't anything to see here! The townsfolk around her refuse to be allayed by this. Perry and Sandra have emerged dubiously out of their car and watch from the periphery, utterly bewildered. Mrs Henscher, newly arrived and wearing her avocado face mask like war paint, shakes her shotgun and points down the street. 
MRS HENSCHER I saw them! I saw them! The zombies are in the Town Hall! The information sweeps across the crowd like wildfire. Several faces turn to Henscher, who is pleased to have an engaged audience and hams it up shamelessly, coming on like Braveheart in curlers. ParaNorman 64. 
110 CONTINUED: 110 
MRS HENSCHER (CONT'D) Cry "Havoc!" and let slip the dogs of war! The faces around her don't react; waiting patiently for a clearer translation. 
MRS HENSCHER (CONT'D) Let's rip `em apart! Mrs Henscher points the crowd toward the Town Hall. Despite Hooper's protests, the townsfolk are on lynch mob auto pilot and surge like a force of nature along the Main Street toward the Town Hall plaza. 
INT. TOWN HALL, ARCHIVES - LATER 
Dozens of books and cardboard boxes lie scattered across the floor. The glass cabinets around the room have been ransacked as the kids drag documents off shelves and rummage through binders. Norman sits on the floor flipping through sheet after sheet of records. Courtney wades through documents toward him, holding up a fist full of old rolled-up papers. 
COURTNEY We're not going to find it in here, Norman! This is useless! 
ALVIN Yeah, I know, and it's also really boring.

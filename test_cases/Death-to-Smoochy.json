{"train": "DEATH TO SMOOCHY by \nAdam Resnick \nDecember 2000 Early Draft \nFOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY \nBEGIN CREDITS \nEXT. KIDNET STUDIO -C - EVENING \nA man in a puffy foam-rubber rhinoceros costume dancing under the bright friendly lights of a television studio. Another rhino and various foam-rubber animals dance behind him to the happy MUSIC. The rhino finishes his number and takes a bow. A bleacher full of kids bursts into wild applause. \nINT. BACKSTAGE - MOMENTS LATER \nAfter the taping. The rhino lumbers down the hallway toward wardrobe. He is suddenly grabbed by two large men and dragged out through the exit into... \nINT. DARK PARKING GARAGE \n... where several   thugs in overcoats emerge from the shadows and start   beating him with lead pipes. One of the men pulls out   a GUN and SHOOTS the rhino several times. The SHOTS    REVERBERATE through the empty garage. FINAL CREDIT: \nCUT TO BLACK: \nSUPERIMPOSE:    ONE YEAR EARLIER \nFADE UP ON: \nINT. TELEVISION STUDIO - DAY \nIt's the taping of another children's show -- \"Rainbow Randolph and the Krinkle Kids.\" RANDOLPH SMILEY, a clean-cut man with a happy face and yellow bow tie, dances through Rainbowland with the \"Krinkle Kids\" (little people in top hats). He sings one of his signature songs: \"Friends Come In All Sizes.\" One of the main Krinkle Kids -- ANGELO PIKE -- dances behind him. \nRANDOLPH (singing) 'Friends come in all sizes That's a fact! It's True! All colors of the rainbow from Mauve to Blue... (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRANDOLPH (CONT'D) Their names may not be different and their shoes may not match One might say 'grasp' while the other says 'snatch' Some like to toss while others like to caaaaatch... Beeee- caaaause... Friends come in all sizes Take it from me! Golly Gee! Size never matters when you want some friendly patter From a pal who is true and can lift you when you're blue You can count on him and he can count on yoooouuuu! It's true... that... (big finish) Friends come in all sizes!' \nDISSOLVE TO: \nMONTAGE - RAINBOW RANDOLPH MERCHANDISE \n\"Sugar Rainbows Cereal,\" plastic toys lined up on store shelves, kids playing with Randolph dolls, kids eating \"Rainbow Potato Chips\" and \"Rainbow Candies.\" A \"Rainbow Burster,\" a kind of gun that shoots plastic rainbows. Marquees announcing upcoming live appearances, etc. We get the picture. Rainbow Randolph is the king of the kid shows. \nINT. DIMLY-LIT BAR - NIGHT \nA suburban-looking HUSBAND and WIFE enter. They find Rainbow Randolph sitting alone, drinking a Scotch. Hair slicked back, sans bow tie, the friendly face no longer looks so friendly. He nods for them to sit down. After a nervous beat, the Husband puts a briefcase on the table and slides it to Randolph. Randolph takes a gulp of his Scotch. He unsnaps the briefcase and opens it. Five grand stares him in the face. \nHUSBAND So... uh... you'll make sure my boy dances up front, right? Where he'll get the most camera time? \nRandolph slams the briefcase shut, startling the couple. \nRANDOLPH You want your kid on the show? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHUSBAND Of... of course. \nWIFE Yes, very much. \nRANDOLPH Then don't tell me how to run my fucking business. \nHUSBAND No, no, we were just -- \nRandolph rises. He takes a final gulp of his Scotch and picks up the briefcase. \nRANDOLPH I'll call you if a spot opens up. \nHe starts to walk off. Suddenly, the Husband and Wife jump up from the table holding guns. \nHUSBAND Freeze, you cocksucker! \nWIFE Drop the briefcase! \nFederal agents storm into the bar and surround Randolph. \nEXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAWN \nBundles of the morning editions are tossed onto the curb from passing trucks.   The various headlines blare: \n\"RAINBOW RANDOLPH BUSTED ACCEPTING BRIBE\" \nSTOKES Sap's just the pill we need right now. Mopes is a straight arrow. Always has been. \nNORA The guy can't get arrested, Frank. He can't even break into the birthday party circuit. Last I heard he was working hospitals and nursing homes. He's a joke. \nStokes stands up and walks around the room. \nSTOKES The truth of the matter is, a successful children's show has always depended on two simple elements: a fuzzy costume and a lot of hype. Strip away the foam rubber and the network money and they're all jokes. Marginal talents.. cabaret acts... off- Broadway runoff... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nNORA I probably have ten acts in my development file -- acts I've been cultivating -- that are more deserving than Sheldon Mopes. \nSTOKES And each one a moral question mark. Something I can't risk at the moment. \nNORA (frustrated) We can do better than this guy, Frank. He brings nothing to the table. \nSTOKES Except ethics. With Mopes, there's never been a whiff of controversy. The man's an ethical, harmless, cornball. In short, a glass of milk on two legs. \nStokes stops pacing. \nNORA Don't ask me to do it. You know I'll do anything for you, but please... not this... \nStokes gazes out the window at the city. \nSTOKES Go find Smoochy. \nEXT. CONEY ISLAND - EARLY EVENING \nThe lighted Ferris wheel spins CENTER FRAME. We CRANE DOWN and eventually LAND ON a side street with the amusement park looming in the b.g. We're in FRONT of a small building. The half-lit neon sign reads: CONEY ISLAND METHADONE CENTER. We DRIFT THROUGH the double doors THROUGH the reception area where random junkies loiter and fill out paperwork. We CONTINUE DOWN a narrow hallway as the faint sound of someone SINGING and playing the GUITAR INCREASES. We finally burst THROUGH another set of doors marked \"Treatment Room.\" The singing now fills our ears as we PUSH IN ON the \"performer\" -- a big, puffy, orange rhinoceros. Smoochy. Or to be more specific, SHELDON MOPES. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSmoochy sits on a stool with his guitar and sings to the patients as they stand in line before a sliding glass window, where a nurse hands each person a little cup of methadone which they immediately drink. \nThe Smoochy costume is a mass of misshapen orange foam rubber that exposes Sheldon's painted face in the front. A multi-colored horn protrudes from his forehead. \nSMOOCHY (SHELDON) (singing to the tune of 'She'll be Comin' round the Mountain') 'We'll get that monkey off your back, Yes we will, yes we will We'll get that monkey off your back, Yes we will...' \n'We'll get that monkey off your back And get your life right back on track If you'll just give up the smack Yes you will, yes you will!!' \nThe song ends.       A few baffled junkies applaud. \nSMOOCHY Thanks, fellas. I'm rooting for you! \nWe PAN AWAY FROM Sheldon TO the exit.      Standing there in her coat, looking mortified, is Nora. \nINT. RECEPTION AREA - SHORT WHILE LATER \nNora sits in the reception area. Sheldon emerges in his street clothes. He carries Smoochy's body on a hanger over his shoulder and carries a large shopping bag which holds Smoochy's head. \nNORA Mr. Mopes? \nSheldon stops. \nSHELDON Yeah? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nNORA I, uh, saw your performance tonight. Very... (searching) ... spirited. \nSHELDON Really? Thanks. I would've done a longer set if that guy hadn't pulled a knife on the security guard. Once the pepper spray starts flyin', that's it for the encores. \nNORA Yes, that did put a damper on the evening, didn't it? \nSHELDON Are you a new patient?   On the juice, as we say? \nNORA Ah, no. But it's sweet of you to assume so. \nShe hands him her card.     He reads it. \nSHELDON 'Nora Bishop. V.P. of Development. Kidnet.' (to Nora) Good gravy. You work for Kidnet? \nNORA As stated. \nSheldon grabs her hand and shakes it. \nSHELDON Well, it's a pleasure to meet you, Nora. A real honor. Hey, you hungry? \nEXT. CONEY ISLAND BOARDWALK - NATHAN'S HOT DOGS - SHORT WHILE LATER \nCONTINUED: \nNora and Stokes watch from the wings with a mixture of uncertainty and disgust. \nDISSOLVE BACK TO: \nWARDROBE ROOM \nA seamstress zips up the back of the finished, redesigned Smoochy costume. Sheldon stands proudly before the design team. Smoochy is now television ready: smoothed out, more colorful, less lumpy and exuding sunshiny happiness. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nSTUDIO -C - BACKSTAGE \nSmoochy is about to enter with the Rhinettes.      ANGELO, a former Krinkle Kid, stands beside him. \nSMOOCHY Angelo, you were always my favorite Krinkle Kid. The way you'd click your heels during the 'Jellybean Jam.' Real artistry. I'm honored to have you as a Rhinette. \nANGELO A job's a job. \nSTUDIO -C - PRACTICE TAPING \nSuddenly lights up in all its multi-colored Smoochyland glory. The bleachers are full of children. \nANNOUNCER (O.S.) Hey, kids! Who's your favorite rhino? \nThe kids in the bleachers all scream in unison. \nKIDS Smoochy! \nSmoochy bounds out on stage followed by the Rhinettes who form a dancing circle around him. \nSMOOCHY Hiya, kids! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nKIDS Hi, Smoochy! \nSMOOCHY It's gonna be a fantabulous day in Smoochyland!! \nThe kids cheer as Smoochy and the Rhinettes featuring Angelo Pike, go into their \"It's a Fantabulous Day in Smoochyland\" number -- a catchy, bouncy song and dance routine that plays out in the sugar-coated jungle of Smoochyland. \nSMOOCHY (singing) 'Ohhhh... it's a fantabulous day in Smoochy-land/Let's have a great big cheer for the Smoochy-land band/We'll dance with our jungle pals, won't that be grand/Oh, it's a fantabulous day in Smoochy- land!' \nSmoochy dances right UP TO the CAMERA, FILLING the FRAME with his friendly, puffy face. \nEND of prep MONTAGE. \nEXT. DOCK BY RIVER - NIGHT (POURING RAIN) \nA disheveled Randolph paces on a deserted dock. The Brooklyn Bridge looms in the b.g. A car pulls up in the b.g. Stokes gets out. Randolph moves under an awning. \nRANDOLPH I was starting to think that maybe you weren't coming. \nSTOKES I agreed to meet you, didn't I?    I had a dinner engagement. \nRandolph takes a swig from a flask. \nRANDOLPH Really? You know, I used to have dinner engagements. Sometimes four, five a night. Dinner... drinks... I was the toast of the fucking town. \nSTOKES Don't start, Randolph.   Please. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRANDOLPH (voice rising) Cars, boats, whores and horses, I had 'em all. When I walked into a restaurant, ten guys reached for my hat. When I stood up to take a piss, they cleared the rest room. I'd walk down the street and traffic stopped, mouths gaped. You know why? You know why, Frank? (now shouting) I was Rainbow fucking Randolph! That's why! \nSTOKES Are you through? \nRANDOLPH What? You're in a hurry? You don't have time for me? The guy who earned for you? The guy who put those fucking suits on your back and the pheasant au vin in your Brooklyn mouth? \nSTOKES I think it's fair to say we helped each other. \nRandolph suddenly breaks down. \nRANDOLPH (pleading) You gotta fix it, Frank. You gotta get me my slot back. \nHe now clings to Stokes' lapels. \nRANDOLPH How can I sit around while that rhinoceros... that horned carpetbagger gets a free ride on my dime? You and I have history, Frank! Please! \nStokes pries Randolph's hands from his overcoat. \nShe keeps walking. Sheldon catches up and walks alongside her, occasionally getting jostled by passersby. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHELDON Good meeting today. I thought we tackled some hot issues. Although, I'll be honest, there were a few times that I felt my voice wasn't being heard. \nNORA I think that's a conservative estimate. \nSHELDON I just want the show to have some weight, you know? Some substance. Silly songs, sure -- but with a message. Pop quiz: How many original compositions are in the Smoochy songbook? \nNORA Do you sense my complete lack of interest? \nSHELDON Try two thousand. Covering every topic from how yummy vegetables are to the importance of donating plasma. Don't you get it, Nora? I'm a valuable resource. Use me. \nNora stops.    She looks Sheldon in the eye for the first time. \nNORA Can I make this real easy for you? \nSHELDON Sure. \nNORA The only reason you're on TV right now is because Rainbow Randolph is a degenerate scumbag. I didn't discover you, I delivered you. Like a bag of groceries. I have a bigger emotional investment in my nail polish. So don't peddle your sap to me, rhino. Your job is just to smile and nod your head. \nShe walks off. \nINT. PATSY'S - NIGHT \nSheldon sits at the bar in the restaurant, nursing a drink and talking to the BARTENDER. He seems slightly drunk. \nSHELDON ... No, no, you misunderstand me. It's not that I'm literally comparing Captain Kangaroo to Jesus Christ. I'm just saying that the Captain, like Christ, was someone you could believe in. Those guys didn't care about bells and whistles and rickita-rackata. It was all about the work. Especially Jesus. Forget about it. \nThe Bartender nods and starts to pour Sheldon another drink. \nSHELDON (waving him off) That's okay, my good man.    Three's my limit. \nBARTENDER I never saw anyone get loaded on orange juice before. \nSHELDON Back in my college days I could put away a carton of the stuff. \nA sharply-dressed man, BURKE BENNETT, sits down next to Sheldon. \nBURKE (to Bartender) Gimme a Five Crown. \nThe Bartender nods.    He looks over at Sheldon. \nBURKE Smoochy the Rhino.    Wow.   I'm a big fan. \nSHELDON (flattered) Gee, thanks. I usually don't get recognized without my horn. \nBurke extends his hand. \nBURKE Burke Bennett.    I represent kid show talent. \nINT. PATSY'S - SHORT WHILE LATER \nSheldon and Burke now sit at a corner table. \nBURKE Look, Shel, Frank Strokes ain't in the business to make you rich. He's in it to make Frank Stokes rich. That's how these network goons operate. \nSHELDON That's so sad. Is it just me, or is that sad? \nBURKE You know, years ago, a client of mine, Dicky Gimble, was having a problem... \nSHELDON Wow, you represented Dicky Gimble? \nBURKE Yeah, before the asshole found religion. Anyway, Stokes was trying to screw my boy out of some merchandising points. Claimed he had a warehouse full of Dicky dolls that weren't moving. Now Frank and I are old friends, so I say to him, 'Okay, cock, show me the warehouse' -- see, I know the fucking warehouse is in the Bronx, and I know it's emptier than my wife's head. (chuckles) To make a long story short, I walk out with a check for a hundred grand and Stokes is sitting there with his thumb up his ass. \nBurke laughs. \nSHELDON That's very amusing, but I don't care about Smoochy dolls and Smoochy floor wax... I just want more creative input. This rhino came from my womb. I bore him, I nursed him, and dammit... \nHe pounds his fist on the table. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHELDON I should be the one who raises him! \nBURKE Shel, it's all about the dough. After you get the money, you get the power. And after you get the power, you can have Smoochy walk on stage with a hard-on if you want. \nSHELDON It's funny, that never crossed my mind. \nBurke downs the rest of his drink and stands up. \nCONTINUED: \nBURKE Think of it as a tool of the trade. \nSHELDON I've never owned a gun, I've never touched a gun, and I don't believe in guns. When I played cowboys and Indians as a kid, I was always the Chinese railroad worker. \nBURKE Trust me, Shel. It's a handy accessory in this business. Even if you don't load it, have it for show. Sometimes that's all you need. Especially with a creep like Randolph lurking around. \nBurke and Sheldon look up and notice the hulking, grinning figure of SPINNER DUNN standing over them. Spinner has the smile of a little boy despite his crooked nose and scarred face. He extends his hand. \nSPINNER Hiya, Smoochy! I'm Spinner! Spinner! \nSHELDON Hi there. \nSPINNER I'm so excited to meet you!    I'm Spinner! \nSpinner's massive hand engulfs Sheldon's. \nSHELDON (remembers) Oh... right. I saw you fight on TV once. I think it was your farewell bout. \nSWISH PAN TO: \nFLASHBACK - INT. BOXING RING(S) - SOMETIME IN THE PAST \nThrough a SERIES OF CUTS we see Spinner getting pummeled in various fights. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRINGSIDE COMMENTATOR #1 Tonight marks Spinner Dunn's final appearance in the ring. What a pleasure it's been to watch him proudly march into the record books for taking more blows to the head than any fighter in history. \nA bloodied, defeated Spinner happily holds up the arm of his opponent after a match. He then hugs the referee. He jumps down from the ring and hugs the three judges. \nRINGSIDE COMMENTATOR #2 Scrambled a bit? Sure. You don't retire with a record of 81-59 and wind up the Governor. But on the upside, he's got the disposition of a collie. \nSpinner wades into the stands and starts hugging the spectators. \nSWISH PAN TO: \nINT. SPINNER DUNN'S RESTAURANT (PRESENT) \nSpinner is still pumping Sheldon's hand. \nSPINNER You know what I love, Smoochy? I love when you do the Jiggy Ziggy dance! You know, the one you do during 'Silly Time?' \nSHELDON You bet.     That's a big one. \nSPINNER Wanna see me do it? \nSHELDON Well, I don't know why if there's enough room here to... \nSpinner starts Jiggying and Ziggying for Sheldon. He bangs into a table and knocks over someone's drink. \nBURKE Okay, champ, don't get overheated. \nSpinner stops, out of breath.       He leans over and hugs Sheldon. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSPINNER I love you. \nSHELDON I... uh... love you, too, Spinner. \nA powerful-looking woman, TOMMY COTTER, calls to Spinner from the bar. \nTOMMY Spinner, come over and meet the Senator! \nSpinner dutifully hurries over to Tommy. \nSHELDON He seems pretty popular. It must take real talent to run a place like this. \nBURKE Spinner? The guy couldn't run a water faucet. He's just a mascot. It's his cousins, a bunch of Irish mob boys, who really run the joint. \nANGLE ON SPINNER \nHe shakes the Senator's hand as Tommy and a few other tough Irish guys stand around. Spinner looks over towards Sheldon. \nSPINNER (loudly) Don't go anywhere, Smoochy! I'll be right back after I take a dump! \nSpinner releases the Senator's hand and rushes off. \nBURKE I think you made a new friend, kid. \nNora is on the phone. She pretends not to notice him. Sheldon bides his time by inspecting knickknacks, examining photos on the wall, etc. Finally, he half- whispers/half-mouths to her: \nSHELDON Whenever you get a chance... I just need a second. \nNORA (into the phone) Listen, can I call you back? Yeah, some asshole's screaming in my ear. Thanks. \nShe hangs up. \nSHELDON I'm sorry, you didn't have to hang up. \nNORA If I didn't you'd still be here. \nSHELDON But I am still here. \nNORA I'm hoping to correct that. \nSHELDON Nora, I want us to start off on the right foot. I want you to know that I value your input and I don't want you to feel intimidated just because the power structure has changed a bit. I consider you a partner. \nNORA Great. That'll come in handy if we're ever at a square dance. \nSHELDON Well, I was never much of the do- se-do type, but what I would love to do is take you out to lunch one day. You know, just two colleagues chewing the fat... forming a mutual respect... planting the seeds of cooperation... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nNORA No. \nSHELDON Fair enough. If you change your mind -- \nNORA I won't. \nSheldon just nods and starts to exit. \nSHELDON Okay then, I'll be in my office if you need me. If you want to brainstorm about anything. Ideas and so forth. \nHe passes a plant by the door. \nSHELDON Ficus? \nShe ignores him.      He exits. \nINT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nSheldon walks slowly down the hallway.     He no longer has a bounce in his step. \nINT. SHELDON'S NEW OFFICE - MOMENT LATER \nSheldon enters his plush new office, awkwardly walks over to his new desk and sits behind it for the first time. \nSHELDON Wow... \nTOMMY (O.S.) My cousin Spinner's take quite a shine to you. \nSheldon jumps. He's surprised to Tommy from Spinner Dunn's restaurant. Tommy's crew, ROY, DANNY, JIMMY and SAMMY occupy the sofa. \nTOMMY Ever since you came in the restaurant. He can't stop yakkin'. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHELDON Well, he's a very nice man. Very sweet disposition for someone that size. \nTOMMY So, I was wondering if maybe you could give him a little floor space. \nSHELDON I'm sorry? \nTOMMY You know, a little part on the show. You're the executive producer now. You call the shots, right? \nSHELDON Uh, that's a very sweet offer, and I love Spinner, but TV is a complicated medium and... I mean, that would be like me getting into the ring with a prizefighter. (laughs) Can you imagine such a thing? Boom. K.O.! What's the alphabet, Mommy? \nSheldon laughs again.       Tommy gets quiet. \nTOMMY This makes me sad.    Very, very, sad. \nDANNY What's wrong, Tommy? \nTOMMY Nothing.     I'm just very sad right now. \nSAMMY Who made you sad, Tommy? \nTOMMY I don't want to mention names. \nThe guys look menacingly at Sheldon. They rise and walk around his desk until they're on either side of him. \nSHELDON Wow.   I'm honored. \nNora trips slightly.     Sheldon takes the whiskey from her. \nSHELDON Why don't we get some air? \nHe leads her out on the balcony.    They look out at the city. \nNORA I... I may have been a little harsh when we spoke the other day. A little out of line. \nSHELDON Well, it wasn't as bad as the week before when you called me a pasty- faced, no-talent hack. \nNORA Yes, that was probably insensitive as well. (looks at him) I heard you're not doing the ice show. I find that... incredibly admirable. Why didn't you tell me? \nSHELDON I guess I didn't want to spoil your fun. You look so content when you're berating me. \nNora looks down. \nNORA I'm afraid I have become a bit hardened over the years. Sincerity's an easy disguise in this business. It's hard to know who's on the level. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHELDON Believe me, I'm learning that more and more every day. (wistfully) 'Sometimes light is really dark, Sometimes crows can sing like larks Sometimes Winter feels like Spring, Don't think you know everything.' \nNORA (in disbelief) 'Rickets the Hippo'? \nSHELDON You remember Rickets? \nNORA That was my favorite show when I was a kid. Rickets was the one face I knew I could trust. \nSHELDON That's how I felt! Rickets had real depth. He was my inspiration for Smoochy. \nNORA Really? He was my inspiration to work in children's television. \nSHELDON I can't believe it. I never met anyone who even remembers Rickets. Do you remember the Klunky-Wunky dance? \nNORA Remember it?   I did it at my first communion. \nSheldon starts doing the rather insane-looking Klunky- Wunky dance. Nora does it with him. They both stop and look at each other. Sheldon impulsively leans in and kisses her. \nSHELDON I'm sorry. That was a mistake, right? I didn't mean for that to hap-- \nNora grabs his head and pulls it toward her.       They begin kissing passionately. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nNORA (as they kiss) You're not full of shit like all the others, are you? \nSHELDON No, no. \nNORA (as they kiss) You're for real, right? \nSHELDON Yes, yes. \nNORA (through the kisses) I mean, I couldn't tell... First I thought it was an act... and then I just thought you were a simp or something... \nSHELDON Shhh... you don't have to explain... \nThey continue to kiss.      Nora abruptly stops. \nNORA I should go. \nSHELDON Why? \nNora exits the balcony and collects her coat and purse. \nSHELDON What's wrong? Is it the whiskey? If you have to throw up, be my guest. Anywhere you like. \nNORA It's just getting late. \nSheldon follows her to the door. She stops and looks at him for a moment. The PHONE starts to RING. Neither of them says anything for a beat. \nNORA Better get that.    Good night. \nShe exits. Sheldon shuts the door and sighs. He goes to the bar to pour himself another orange juice before picking up the phone. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHELDON Hello? \nA huge swastika banner unfurls behind Smoochy, framing him like Patton in front of the American flag. Flashbulbs go off. The \"Heil Smoochys\" continue. A GERMAN MARCH starts to BLARE from the SPEAKERS. Looking stunned, Sheldon slowly leans into the mic. He clears his throat. The MUSIC STOPS. Everyone quiets down. He searches for just the right words, and finally... \nSHELDON It's my sincere hope that I'm dreaming right now, but in the event that I'm not... what's the deal with the swastikas? \nSuddenly, a sea of policemen bursts into the warehouse. \nLEAD COP This is an unlawful assembly, you kraut sons-a-bitches! You're all under arrest! \nPandemonium ensues us all the Nazis run for cover. Sheldon stands in the middle of it all, unsure what to do. \nEXT. WAREHOUSE - SHORT WHILE LATER \nSheldon is led from the warehouse in handcuffs and is barraged with questions from waiting REPORTERS. Flashbulbs go off as they shout out questions. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nREPORTER #1 Are you officially a member of the Aryan Brotherhood, Sheldon? \nREPORTER #2 Is it true you consider Adolph Hitler your personal hero? \nREPORTER #3 Do you think associating with neo- Nazis might adversely affect your career? \nREPORTER #4 How does it feel to be a hate- filled racist scumbag? \nSHELDON This is a mix-up! I'm innocent! I don't hate anyone! \nREPORTER #4 Does that mean you don't hate Nazis? \nSHELDON Wait!   I didn't say that!   I -- \nSheldon is shoved into the back seat of a squad car.     It drives off, SIRENS BLARING. \nMONTAGE \nEXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT \nThe squad car drives through Times Square. The headlines on the zipper marquee GLIDE THROUGH the FRAME: \"Smoochy the Rhino Arrested at Nazi Rally... Cops Raid Warehouse During Rhino's Performance... Aryan Brotherhood Declares Smoochy 'One of us.'... President Condemns 'Smoochy the Fascist'...\" \nINT. SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nSheldon stares out the window as the dark city passes by. We SLOWLY MOVE IN ON his eyes as we... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nFLASHBACK - STUDIO C - SOMETIME IN PAST \nIn SLOW MOTION, Smoochy dances in the studio while holding a delighted little girl in his arms. \nPOLICE PRECINCT \nSheldon is fingerprinted and photographed. \nAFRICAN JUNGLE \nSTOCK FOOTAGE of a wild rhinoceros being shot by hunters. \nSTUDIO C \nSmoochy's Magic Jungle is dismantled. \nSUBURBAN DRIVEWAY - PAST \nA young Sheldon helps his grandfather spread black paint on a driveway. \nTIMES SQUARE - DAY (PRESENT) \nThe Smoochy billboard is torn down. \nBLACK LIMBO \nThe Smoochy costume is in flames.    It slowly burns to ashes. \nEXT. KIDNET BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY \nThe Kidnet CEO stands before a cluster of reporters and network cameras. We can see the Times Square zipper marquee THROUGH the glass doors behind him. \nHeadlines read: \"Congressional Committee Probes Nazi Ties to Kid Biz\"... \"Smoochy Photos Removed From City Elementary Schools\"... \"Jewish Groups Plan 'Day of Outrage'\"... \"Rhino in Bronx Zoo Pelted With Eggs\"... \nCEO Here at Kidnet, Smoochy the Rhino is now Smoochy the Ghost. We have excised that particular malignancy from our network and will seek out a suitable replacement. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nOn a large screen TV the smiling Asian face of Takashi Yamashita, who's singing Cole Porter's \"I Get a Kick Out of You\" in Japanese. \nCUT BACK to reveal Takashi wearing a white sequined tuxedo with tails as he plays a white grand piano. He looks like an Asian Liberace. He is circled by a group of Japanese children who sing along with him. \nCHICK (V.O.) 'Takashi Sings Tin Pan Alley for Youngsters' is the hottest show on Japanese television. The sweat shops are working overtime trying to keep up with the demand. Record albums, toys, cereal, tee shirts, you name it... \nINT. STOKES' OFFICE - DAY \nSeveral tough-looking Asian men -- CHICK, SAMBO, and TOBI -- Takashi's management group -- sits in Stokes' office. Takashi sits quietly in the corner. Stokes sits behind his desk, sipping his trademark glass of wine. \nCHICK Look, Stokes, let's cut the bullshit. We want Takashi in that Smoochy slot and we're willing to do whatever it takes to get it. \nSTOKES Pardon me for saying this, but for a non-resident of this country, you speak impeccable English. \nCHICK I'm originally from Teaneck. \nSTOKES Ah. \nCHICK We own every hair on this bastard's head and we're willing to share a few strands... if you get my drift. \nSTOKES Well, it's not that simple. I have an executive board to answer to. I wish I could just snap my fingers and make a deal but -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCHICK You mean like this? \nChick snaps his fingers and Tobi, the third Asian guy, walks over and drops a duffel bag on Stokes' desk. \nSTOKES Oh my.   And what is this on my desk? \nCHICK Two hundred grand in a Louis Vuitton duffle bag. Get our boy the slot and we'll round it off to a million. And you can keep the luggage. \nStokes stares down at the bundle of opportunity on his desk. \nCHICK You're dealing with an honorable culture, Frank. We know how to play ball. \nStokes unzips the bag and gazes at the money.     He looks up at Chick and smiles. \nSTOKES Gentlemen, I suddenly feel invigorated and full of hope. \nChick smiles. \nINT. NORA'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING \nOn Nora's TV screen, we see the black and white image of Rickets the Hippo doing the \"Klunky-Wunky Dance.\" Nora sits on the couch and stares hypnotically at the screen. There is a KNOCK at the door. She gets up and ejects the \"Best of Rickets\" tape. She opens the door. To her surprise, Randolph is standing there. \nRANDOLPH Hiya, cutie! \nBefore she can respond, he enters the apartment and takes off his jacket. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRANDOLPH So here's the good news: Yes, I'll be happy to end my sabbatical and return to my old slot. I know you and Frank are in a bind, so I'll start Monday. Call wardrobe, call props, tell 'em the R man is back and he's ready to start whistlin' dem happy tunes for da little chillens. \nHe flops down on the couch. \nRANDOLPH Ahhh. Who do ya gotta blow to get a Scotch around here? \nHe laughs. \nNORA You've got three seconds to pry your ass off my couch and get out. \nRandolph jumps to his feet. \nRANDOLPH Dammit, Nora! The rhino's gone! You need that slot filled and I'm ready to reclaim what's rightfully mine. \nNORA Just in case you forgot, you're a criminal and a scumbag. \nRANDOLPH Okay, so maybe I commandeered a stray shekel or two. Big deal! Compared to what Smoochy did that's like jerking off in the supermarket. \nNORA Where do you shop? \nRandolph walks over and puts his hands on her shoulders. \nRANDOLPH Come on. Have you lost all affection for me? After what we once had? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nNORA That was a long time ago.    I was young and stupid. \nRANDOLPH'S POV - DANNY \napproaches. He cocks his arm and throws a punch. Danny's fist FILLS the FRAME, TURNING IT BLACK as we hear the PUNCH. \nEXT. TIMES SQUARE - SERIES OF DISSOLVES - BEFORE DAWN \nNewspaper trucks pull up to various newsstands and toss out bundles of the morning editions. As each bundle lands on the curb, we see headlines that span over the next few days: \nSMOOCHY SET UP - SMILEY BEHIND NAZI PLOT \nPLANNED TO DESTROY RHINO'S REP \nPOLL:   RAINBOW RANDOLPH MOST HATED MAN IN AMERICA \nPUBLIC OUTCRY:   \"WE'RE SORRY SMOOCHY!\" \nEXT. POLICE PRECINCT - DAY \nRandolph, bruised and battered, emerges from the police station with his LAWYER. REPORTERS and photographers rush forward. \nREPORTER #1 How does it feel to be voted the most hated man in America, Randolph? \nRANDOLPH In a country like this, where your average citizen is a fuckin' Neanderthal, I wear it as a badge of honor. \nREPORTER #2 What about Ms. Bishop's charge that you have an unhealthy obsession with Sheldon Mopes? \nRANDOLPH Listen, I barely know that broad. She's a wacko. An opportunist. I'm the most accused man since Jimmy Hoffa. \nSomeone throws an egg and it hits Randolph in the face. \nRANDOLPH (on verge of tears) That was unfair! Who threw that? That was mean and uncalled for! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLAWYER My client is not answering any more questions. Between his dwindling cash flow and mounting legal bills he's sinking into a deep psychotic depression. Please stop antagonizing him. Thank you. \nHe pushes a sullen Randolph through the cluster of people. \nINT. BACKSTAGE - STUDIO C - DAY \nA makeup woman dabs Sheldon's forehead as he's about to go on. Nora stands next to him. A LOW TYMPANY ROLL is heard from the stage. \nSHELDON (to Nora) I wouldn't be back here if it wasn't for you. \nNORA I'm just sorry I didn't believe you... that I got swept up in the frenzy of anti-Smoochyism. \nSHELDON Well, this town's a house of mirrors sometimes. It's hard to know what you're looking at. \nHe takes a couple of pre-show deep breaths.      A STAGEHAND approaches. \nSTAGEHAND They're ready for you, Sheldon. \nSheldon exits backstage. \nINT. STUDIO C - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nThe lights in the studio dim. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) Ladies and gentlemen... boys and girls... (dramatic pause) Who's your favorite rhino? \nAn explosion of enthusiasm from the kids in the bleachers. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nKIDS IN BLEACHERS Smoochy!!! \nThe lights come up as the Smoochyland Band plays a strong, dramatic version of \"Battle Hymn of the Republic.\" After a moment, Smoochy slowly rises from a lift under the stage. A giant sign above the jungle lights up and emits a pyrotechnic shower of sparks. It reads: WELCOME HOME SMOOCHY! \nANGLE ON SMOOCHYLAND BAND \nA beaming Spinner Dunn enthusiastically bangs his cowbell to the music as tears stream down his cheeks. \nBACK ON SMOOCHY \nHe majestically stands center stage and nods to the kids who are giving him a standing ovation. The song crescendos with a rousing final chorus from the Smoochyland Band who sing, \"His truth is marching on!\" \nThunderous applause from the bleachers. Smoochy walks over to a stool and takes a seat. It's very quiet in the studio now. Smoochy, looking uncharacteristically serious, picks up a microphone as the lights go down. He's in black limbo. \nSMOOCHY Thank you. It's good to be back. You know, kids, sometimes life in the jungle can be unfair. A place where nice guys don't just finish last... they get their heads cut off. \nGasps from the bleachers. \nBURKE Like they say, rock bottom's a college education. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHELDON But here's the really good news: I'm doing it myself. No sponsors, no vendors, no crooks. Not one dirty hand will touch this. Not one person will make a dollar off these kids. Smoochy on Ice will be a study in purity. \nBurke's grin suddenly fades. \nSHELDON As far as food concessions go, I'll supply the refreshments. For free. Low sodium, whole wheat pretzels and apple slices. Healthy stuff. Now are you ready for the best part? \nBURKE I'm holding my breath. \nSHELDON All profits from ticket sales will be used to built a state-of-the- art methadone clinic in Coney Island. \nBurke looks pale. \nSHELDON I'm not just talking a run-of-the- mill clinic... I'm going to build a methadone palace. A place where men and women can withdraw in luxury. \nBURKE Sheldon, you can't do an ice show and cut out the vendors. And more importantly, you can't cut out the Parade of Hope. It's suicide. \nSHELDON You always told me, when you've got muscles you make the rules. Well, I'm feeling pretty strong right now. \nSheldon rises and tosses his napkin down. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHELDON All this time I was letting the business use me. Well, I think it's time I start using the business. I've got my clout back and I'm not gonna waste it this time. Take care of it, Burke. \nSheldon exits.    Burke sits there, looking very concerned. \nOn his way out the door, Tommy stops Sheldon.       Spinner's COWBELL CLANGING continues. \nTOMMY Shel, you gotta help me out. He bangs that goddamn thing from morning till night. I got a headache that goes from my eyes to my ass. \nSHELDON Whatever I can do, Tommy, just say it. You know I love Spinner. And I owe you. \nTOMMY Give the boy something else to do on the show. Anything. Just as long as it don't clang, chime or honk. \nINT. STOKES' OFFICE - TIGHT ON FACE OF FRANK STOKES - DAY \nfrightened.    There's a gun to his temple. \nWIDER \nChick, the Asian representative of Takashi, holds a revolver on Stokes. His cohorts, Sambo and Tobi, stand by. \nCHICK I don't like complications, Frank. You got one week to get Takashi that slot or you're gonna be shakin' hands with Buddha. \nSTOKES Don't you understand? My hands are tied. The rhino's been exonerated. The show's more popular than ever. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCHICK (to Sambo and Tobi) Okay, boys, chop him up, bag him and dump him in the woods. \nSambo and Tobi start to advance on Stokes. \nSTOKES All right! I'll take care of it! I just need time! \nChick leans into Stokes' face. \nCHICK One week, Jeeves. Got that? Or I get a blender and make an Orange Julius with your feet. \nThey exit. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nA down-and-out Randolph shuffles along in ratty bedroom slippers. He passes a MAN who sits behind a small table on the sidewalk. The table has a huge photograph of a rhinoceros taped in front of it. Literature and pamphlets depicting the black rhino are spread out on the table. \nMAN Save the rhino! Before it's too late! Make a donation! Save the rhino! (to Randolph) Hey, mister, ya wanna help save the rhino? \nRandolph just looks at him for a moment. He looks at all the rhino-related imagery. He starts shaking and suddenly jumps over the table and attacks the Man. \nRANDOLPH I'm the one who needs to be saved! Me. I'm broke! I lost my lawyer! My only friend kicked me out! I'm a fucking peanut shell in the shape of a man! Save the Rainbow! Save the Rainbow! Save the Rainbow! \nMAN Help!   Someone call a cop! \nRandolph grabs the collection can and runs off. \nEXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY \nWIDER \nRandolph stands on the table directly in front of the Kidnet Building. He raises the megaphone to his mouth. \nRANDOLPH Attention, New Yorkers! You are about to hear a shocking story of injustice! \nWIDER \nRandolph stands on the table directly in front of the Kidnet Building. \nRANDOLPH I urge you to listen! It has a surprise ending you won't want to miss! \nA crowd starts to form on the sidewalk. \nRANDOLPH It's the story of a venomous rhino and his aggressive campaign to slander, vilify, defame, denigrate and villainize my good name! But one thing he can't do, is take my life from me. No, friends, only I have the power to do that! \nHe reaches down and picks up a can of gasoline. \nRANDOLPH This is what Smoochy has done to me! He's brought me to this! I can no longer live in a world where the innocent suffer and the wicked thrive! \nRandolph raises the can over his head and pauses dramatically. \nRANDOLPH Where is God??!! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHe drenches himself with gasoline. The crowd grows larger. He holds up a pack of matches. \nRANDOLPH I'm sorry to do this, people. Don't try to talk me out of it. \nThe crowd starts to applaud.     Randolph looks baffled. \nMAN IN CROWD Do it!   Light it! \nRANDOLPH Our guest of honor will be here any moment! This is for his eyes! For his conscience. He'll have to live with this imagine for the rest of his miserable life! \nINT. LIMO - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nSheldon sits in the back of a limo on his way to work, reading the paper. The headline blares: \"SMOOCHY ANNOUNCES ICE SHOW AT GARDEN.\" The subhead reads: \"ALL PROCEEDS TO BENEFIT BROOKLYN CLINIC.\" \nSMOOCHY (to driver) Take it from me, Lester. Use your power. Don't squander it -- build with it. \nLESTER Sound advice, Mr. Mopes. If I ever get any power I'll give that a whirl. (notices crowd up ahead) Hey, what's going on up there? \nSheldon glances up from his paper. \nSMOOCHY (casually) Looks like a street performer of some sort. \nHe goes back to his paper. \nEXT. TIMES SQUARE - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nRandolph sees the Kidnet limo approaching. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRANDOLPH This is it, folks! It's showtime! I'm sorry to do this, but he's left me no choice! \nRandolph tries to light another match, but it's wet from the gasoline. The crowd laughs and starts taunting him. \nRANDOLPH Shut up, you hillbilly assholes! You're borough trash! Go back to your huts across the river! \nRandolph keeps trying to light the match. Finally, after several attempts, it lights. He holds it up. The crowd burst into applause. \nRANDOLPH Fuck you! Fuck all you people! I was the last of the Mohicans! You'll never see another Rainbow Randolph in this lifetime! You had me and you blew it! All of you! \nHe turns and faces the approaching limousine. \nRANDOLPH This if for you, Smoochy! Remember this! As long as you live, remember this image! You did this to me! \nHe brings the match closer to his gasoline-soaked body. The limo continues to approach. The crowd taunts him to do it. He tries to bring the match closer, but his hand is shaking. Suddenly, a LITTLE GIRL pushes through the crowd. Everyone quiets down as she looks up at Randolph. \nLITTLE GIRL Whatcha doin', Rainbow Randolph? \nRandolph freezes as he looks down at the Little Girl. A slight look of hope comes over his face. She smiles sweetly at him, walks over, and blows out the match. Randolph is overcome with emotion. Just then, Sheldon's LIMO WHOOSHES past him. The crowd cheers. \nCROWD Smoochy!!! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHELDON Hi. \nNORA I read about the ice show. \nSHELDON Yeah, the papers seem to be really covering it. \nNORA I think it's great. What you're doing for that clinic. \nSHELDON Thanks. \nShe nods. \nNORA I just need some clarification... \nSHELDON Don't worry. Spinner just needs a little more rehearsal. I'll get him there. \nNORA No I mean about us. \nSheldon looks uncomfortable. \nNORA Ever since you've been back I just feel like there's something that's not connecting. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHELDON I guess I'm still readjusting a little. Like a guy who's come back from the war. Not that I'd equate my misfortune with the \nbrave men and women who protect us overseas. \nNORA I just thought we were on our way to something... granted, my mistaken belief that you had ties to Neo-Nazis might have put a damper on our relationship, but I'm sorry for -- \nSheldon suddenly jumps up and grabs her. He kisses her passionately. Nora immediately starts ripping off his costume as they make out. They fall to the floor in a lustful embrace. \nINT. STUDIO - BACK HALLWAY - SAME TIME \nSpinner, humming to himself, lumbers down the hallway on his way to the wardrobe room. Halfway down the hall, he hears a voice call out to him. \nVOICE (O.S.) Hey -- rhino. \nSpinner turns around. The door to the fire exit swings open. Two of Merv's thugs emerge and grab Spinner (who's still in full Moochy costume) and drag him into the stairwell. \nINT. UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE - MOMENT LATER \nSpinner is dragged into the garage and knocked to the pavement. Several more thugs emerge from the shadows, including Henry, Merv's main henchman. They start beating him with lead pipes. Henry pulls out a REVOLVER. He SHOOTS the rhino several times. A sedan trunk is popped open and Moochy is thrown inside. The CAR SCREECHES up to the street. \nINT. CHINATOWN - NIGHT \nWe CRANE DOWN FROM a Chinese banner that stretches across two tenements. We LAND ON the seedy, deserted street below as the SEDAN BARRELS INTO FRAME and SQUEALS to a stop. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nTwo thugs emerge from the car. They pull Spinner/Moochy from the trunk and toss his body by some garbage cans, knocking a few over. They get back in the car and speed away. Moochy's lifeless foam body rolls into the gutter and lays motionless. Blood seeps through his foamy torso. \nLOW OVERHEAD SHOT \nof Spinner/Moochy. We SLOWLY START TO RISE UP as we LOOK DOWN AT the rhino's body. The WIND WHISTLES through the empty street as we get HIGHER. The Chinese banner rustles THROUGH the FRAME. As we get HIGHER AND HIGHER, we hear the intermittent CLANG of a PRIZE FIGHT BELL. \nMATCH DISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. SAME STREET - HOURS LATER \nIn the same frame, detectives and uniformed cops are now at the scene gathering evidence. Where Spinner once lay, there is now a bright yellow chalk outline in the shape of a rhinoceros. \nINT. PARADE OF HOPE OFFICES - NEXT DAY \nFULL FRAME ON a TELEVISION screen.    A local news anchor is reading the top story. \nANCHOR (V.O.) Former heavyweight contender and restaurateur Lawrence 'Spinner' Dunn was found shot to death in a rhinoceros outfit early this morning in Chinatown. Dunn, a frequent performer on 'Smoochy's Magic Jungle,' was pronounced dead at the scene. Police are searching for -- \nA hand ENTERS FRAME and violently slaps the TV OFF. \nWIDE \nAn enraged Merv Green glares at his henchmen, Henry and MITCH. \nMERV How could you hit the wrong rhino?! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHENRY Who knew Smoochy had a cousin Moochy? They look fucking identical. \nMERV Smoochy is bright orange, Moochy is burnt rust! Read the papers! Do I gotta take you back to fucking kindergarten? \nINT. LIBERTY BISCUIT AND FLOUR FACTORY - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nInside the massive dormant factory, rats scurry around and pigeons occasionally fly from window sill to window sill. A makeshift living area has been set up in the middle of it all -- a chair, lamp, small table, hot plate, etc. Randolph lays on the dilapidated conveyor belt, huddled under a blanket. \nAngelo enters the factory through a rusty door, carrying provisions. \nANGELO It's heatin' up out there. Every cop in New York is looking for you. And Tommy Cotter's boys are combin' the streets. You're gonna have to stay put for a while. \nRandolph sits up on the conveyor belt, blanket draped over his shoulders. He's a physical and emotional wreck. \nRANDOLPH I was an altar boy once. Did you know that? I wanted to be a priest. Do you believe in angels, Angie? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nANGELO Angels? \nRANDOLPH There was a little angel in pigtails. She was the only one who cared about me. She saved my life. \nAngelo hops up on the conveyor belt to console Randolph. Randolph rests his head on Angelo's shoulder. \nANGELO You didn't want to kill yourself, Randy. You know that. \nRANDOLPH Perhaps it's time to heal. To accept the fact that Smoochy has won and gracefully march forward. True, I'm currently wanted for a murder I didn't commit. But I have faith. Faith that justice will prevail. \nANGELO Now you're talkin', kid. This is a big step... I'm proud of you. \nHe strokes Randolph's head. \nRANDOLPH Did you bring lunch? \nANGELO Yes. \nRANDOLPH Chicken and stars? \nANGELO Just like you asked for. \nRANDOLPH Can I have some, please? \nANGELO For a smile. \nRandolph sniffs and manages a small pitiful smile. Angelo musses his hair. \nANGELO Atta boy. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nAngelo lifts one of the grocery bags onto the conveyor belt. \nANGELO Here, I got you some crossword puzzles and stuff to read. \nAngelo hops off the conveyor belt and turns on the hot plate. He starts to open a can of soup. Randolph reaches into the bag and pulls out a copy of the New York Post. The lead article's headline reads, \"WAKE FOR SPINNER.\" A large photograph shows mourners leaving the restaurant after the wake. Clearly visible are Sheldon and Nora. They have their arms around each other. Randolph's eyes widen. He starts to hyperventilate. Angelo looks up. \nANGELO You okay? Randy? \nFinally, Randolph expels a blood-curdling scream that ECHOES through the factory. \nRANDOLPH Motherfucker!!!!!!! \nAngelo drops the soup.      Birds in the factory flutter from the rafters. \nINT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - ICE RINK \nSheldon and the Rhinettes work on some choreography for that night's show. Nora watches from the sidelines. As Sheldon skates on the ice rink, Merv enters with Roy and Danny. Sheldon skates over to them. Nora walks over, too. \nTOMMY Big news, Shel. \nSHELDON What's that? \nTOMMY It wasn't Smiley who killed Spinner. It was Parade of Hope. \nNORA Merv Green? \nSHELDON Are you sure? The cops have tons of evidence on Randolph. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nTOMMY We did our own investigation. Cousin Ian from down at the morgue... you met him at the wake... \nFLASHBACK - INT. SPINNER DUNN'S - DAY \nHe removes the knife from her throat and hurls it toward the bulletin board. It lands -- sticking right in the middle of a Smoochy card. \nCHICK Auf Wiedersehen, honey. \nThey exit. \nINT. SHELDON'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT \nNora is pacing.    Sheldon sits by the fire. \nNORA It's Stokes. He's behind the whole thing! He cut some kind of deal for the Smoochy slot! \nSHELDON What are you talking about? \nNORA He wants you out so he can put Takashi in! \nSHELDON Who's Takashi? \nNORA Jesus, Sheldon! Don't you ever pick up a copy of International Performer? He's the hottest kid show host from Asia. \nSheldon's head is swimming. Suddenly the front door to to the penthouse bursts open. Randolph, dressed like he's about to do his old show, stumbles in waving a gun. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRANDOLPH Ah! How very cozy. Like two logs in a little bonfire. All we need is a few sticks and some wienies. \nHe almost trips as he stumbles over to Sheldon.      He waves the gun in his face. \nRANDOLPH I had her before you! Pachyderm! I was in love with her! In love! And you snatched her away! Like a common thief! You're the bad guy! Not me! He's the bad guy, Nora. He's incapable of understanding the love we once had! Tender, yet passionate. Old-fashioned, yet experimental. (cackles) Tell him about a few of our experiments, Nora! Tell him! \nSheldon looks stunned.    Nora hangs her head. \nSHELDON (to Nora) Is this true? Please tell me it's just the confused ramblings of a diseased mind. \nShe looks at him, but doesn't say anything. \nSHELDON Holy mother of Toledo. When exactly were you planning to let me know about this?! \nNORA (turns to Sheldon) Listen, there was a time -- and I'm not proud of this -- but there was a time when I was a bit of a... kiddie-host groupie. \nRANDOLPH You're just another action figure for her collection! \nNORA That's not fair! \nRANDOLPH Tell him about Jingle Jackson! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHELDON You dated Jingle Jackson? \nRANDOLPH The bells turned her on. Hey, tell him about Jumbo Johnny! There's a tale for ya! A whale of a tale! \nShe looks down, somewhat ashamed.      A look of utter shock \ncomes over Sheldon. \nSHELDON Oh good Lord in Heaven. \nNORA Look, what I did before I met you is none of your business. \nRANDOLPH Shut up!   Both of you! This is my show! \nHe waves the gun threateningly as he backs up to an armchair and sits down. \nRANDOLPH Do you fully understand the power of a condemned man? Do you? I'm already wanted for one murder, why should I give a flaming horse's twat if I commit two more? \nSHELDON I... uh... read once that the best way to diffuse a tense situation is with a little humor. To that end, would you like to hear a funny joke? \nRANDOLPH (rolling his eyes) Oh, please. Go blow yourself, Martha. (waves gun again) Fix me a beverage, woman. Make me one of those drinks that used to make us all warm and fuzzy before bouncy-bouncy time! \nNORA Fix it yourself, asshole. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRANDOLPH (points to gun) Remember, I have Mr. Boomy. \nSHELDON I'm telling you, you'd love this joke. It revolves around Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny getting into a fender bender. \nNora rolls her eyes and goes to the bar. \nRandolph emerges from a cab and runs through the crowd outside the Garden. A few people recognize him. \nMAN It's Rainbow Randolph!   Someone stop him! \nRandolph finds a side exit and slips into the arena. \nINT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - FEW MINUTES LATER \nThe \"Opera on Ice\" continues. The soprano continues singing as Smoochy reenacts the incidents of his recent life. The fairy princess brings Smoochy to a room with a gleaming white desk. Smoochy takes a seat behind the desk. The fairy princess places a crown on his head, bids him good-bye, and floats away. Smoochy sits proudly in his new world. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSuddenly, Rhinettes dressed as devils glide in and skate in a circle around the desk. They throw money at Smoochy. He jumps up and skates away, but the Rhinette devils pursue him with daggers. The music from the orchestra intensifies as the drama plays out. \nNETWORK BOX \nNora continues to watch the opera, totally entranced. Stokes and Burke look a little on edge. Burke glances at his watch. \nCATWALK \nBuggy finishes loading the rifle. He shines the barrel with his sleeve and looks through the scope as Smoochy and company continue to perform below. \nPOV THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE \nAtmospheric fog created by the smoke machine is so thick that Buggy has difficulty FINDING Sheldon THROUGH the cross-hairs. Occasionally, Smoochy skates through a hole in the clouds only to disappear again. BUGGY CURSES in frustration. \nARENA \nRandolph pushes his way past Garden security and runs toward the rink. Several cops working the event spot him. A few spectators scream in horror. \nICE RINK \nThe soprano's mournful aria reaches its crescendo as Smoochy is now pursued by Rhinettes dressed as Nazis. They hold signs with words like \"SCANDAL\" and \"SHAME.\" Smoochy skates to a section of the rink resembling Chinatown where he lands over a fallen \"Moochy.\" He cradles Moochy's head in his arms as the Nazis glide past him and disappear into the fog. \nNETWORK BOX \nNora wipes a tear from her eye as she watches the tragedy play out. Burke and Stokes glance skyward. Nora notices this. \nRINK'S EDGE \nRandolph reaches the rink as cops push their way toward him. \nRANDOLPH Sheldon!!! \nBut Sheldon can't hear over the orchestra.   The soprano hits a high note. \nCATWALK \nBuggy aims the rifle. \nPOV THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE \nSmoochy glides THROUGH the cross-hairs followed by a Rhinette. \nTIGHT ON BUGGY'S FINGER \nas he quickly squeezes off a SHOT. \nRINK \nThe MUFFLED sound of GUNSHOT is absorbed by the intense music. A wounded Rhinette falls to the ice, but no one notices. Smoochy, oblivious, continues to skate toward the \"gates of heaven\" with the angel Moochy. Giant white gates slowly swing open at the rink's far end as floating angels open their arms to welcome Moochy. \nOUTER RINK \nRandolph runs around the rink's perimeter, trying to get Sheldon's attention. Cops and security push their way towards Randolph. He suddenly notices the felled Rhinette on the ice and looks skyward. He can make out a rifle barrel protruding from the catwalk. \nNETWORK BOX \nStokes and Burke notice a commotion in the audience. They now see Randolph running through the crowd on his way to the stairwell. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSTOKES (whispering to Burke) What's he doing here?! He's going to screw everything up! \nNora notices the distressed look on their faces and follows their gaze to the rafters. She now sees the rifle barrel. \nANGLE - NORA \njumps to her feet.      FAST PUSH IN TO Nora's mouth. \nNORA (screaming) Sheldon!!! \nBuggy crashes into the middle of the rink, cob-webbing the ice around him. \nCATWALK \nTommy and his boys runs off to find Sheldon. The COPS help Randolph off the catwalk. He's a nervous wreck. \nCOP #1 You okay? \nRANDOLPH I don't know. I'm kind of fucked up in general, so it's hard to gauge. \nThey pat the dazed Randolph on the back.   He passes out. \nRINK \nPeople continue to run through the rink. Felled Rhinettes litter the ice like broken dolls. Smoke fills the air. Sheldon is helping a random woman to her feet as Nora finally reaches him. She embraces him. \nNORA Burke's with Stokes.   He's been in it all along. \nSheldon looks toward the network box. Beyond it, through the smoke, he sees Burke shoving his way through people who jam the exit trying to escape. Sheldon reaches into his costume and pulls out his gun. \nNORA No, Sheldon, don't! \nSheldon runs off leaving Nora. \nEXIT \nBurke is almost through the cluster of people. He glances over his shoulder and sees Sheldon heading toward him. He shoves even harder now and finally gets through. \nEXT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nBurke makes a run for it down 33rd Street. A moment later, Sheldon emerges from the building. He sees Burke in the distance and takes off after him. He's still in his skates and wearing the partially-blown-off Smoochy head. \nFURTHER DOWN STREET \nBurke looks behind and sees the nightmarish image of a disfigured Smoochy chasing after him. He quickly rounds the corner. \nEXT. STREET \nA few moments later Sheldon rounds the corner. He looks down the street and sees no sign of Burke. He notices an alley by an abandoned building. \nEXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nSheldon walks slowly into the alley, gun drawn. Suddenly, Burke jumps out from behind some boxes. He whacks Sheldon's head with a garbage can lid. The gun goes flying. Burke goes for it, but Sheldon is quickly on his feet and pounces on him. The two men fight it out. Burke manages to get on top of Sheldon and starts to strangle him. \nBURKE You fucking point a gun at me? A gun I gave you as a gift?! Where's your fucking etiquette? \nJust as Sheldon begins to lose consciousness, we hear a GUNSHOT. Burke looks up. Nora stands there, pointing Sheldon's gun directly at him. \nNORA Let him go. \nBurke just looks at her. \nNORA Now. Before I pump one in that Grecian Formula scalp of yours. \nBurke smirks as he releases Sheldon. Sheldon jumps up and takes the gun from Nora. He shakily points it at Burke. \nBURKE You know something, kid? You've turned out to be an incredible pain in the ass. \nBurke slowly stands up, brushing off his suit. \nSHELDON You were behind the Spinner hit, weren't you? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBURKE That was a tragic mistake. (shakes head sadly) If only one could turn back time... (beat) But what the hell, it's just one less mick in the world. \nHe laughs. \nNORA You son-of-a-bitch. \nSheldon cocks the gun. \nBURKE Oh my. What are you gonna do? Kill me? That wouldn't be very Smoochy-like behavior. \nSHELDON You're right. There's just one thing... \nSheldon tears off the remains of his tattered costume and steps out of it. \nSHELDON I'm not Smoochy. \nSheldon is shaking as he extends the gun to Burke's head. \nSHELDON I finally realized we're living in a different jungle. \n", "test1_input": "The kids in the bleachers erupt in unison: \nKIDS Magic Cookie Bag! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSMOOCHY Right-o-riffic! (looks skyward) Magic Cookie Bag, I command thee! Come to your lord and master! \nThe lights dim as the Smoochyland Band plays the \"2001 theme.\" Smoochy's Magic Cookie Bag is lowered from the ceiling by a filament wire. The kids go crazy. \nSMOOCHY (singing) 'Lookie, lookie, lookie, here comes the cookies! Fresh and organic, no need to panic! Right from the soil, no tropical oils! Sweetened with juice, for an energy boost! Fiber galore, you'll be askin' for more...' \nANGLE ON NORA \nShe looks pissed, but then looks over at the kids in the bleachers. Their faces are filled with laughter. For the first time she feels the connection Smoochy has with them. \nANGLE ON RANDOLPH \nHe peers out from his hiding place backstage. His eyes widen with delight as the Magic Cookie Bag continues its descent. \nANGLE ON SMOOCHY \nThe cookie bag finally reaches Smoochy. He holds the bag high above his head in a religious ceremonial fashion as the Rhinettes and the kids crowd around him. \nSMOOCHY Oooh... just the smell of unprocessed flour makes my tummy do somersaults! \nANGLE ON RANDOLPH \nRANDOLPH (under his breath) Whatever that means, you fucking retard. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSMOOCHY \nHis puffy orange hand reaches for the bag's clasp as the MUSIC reaches its CRESCENDO. \nRANDOLPH \nHe's practically shaking as he suppresses an insane laugh. \nRANDOLPH Give 'em a cookie... give 'em a cookie... \nSMOOCHY \nHe reaches into the bag, and with a grand flourish, pulls out a flaming red penis cookie. The cookie is somewhat misshapen and not perfectly formed. Smoochy gets a big grin. \nSMOOCHY Wow! Look at this cookie, kids! A rocket ship! \nThe kids \"ooh\" and \"ahh.\" \nANGLE ON RANDOLPH \nHe looks confused. \nSHELDON What a special day with such special cookies! \nBACK ON SMOOCHY \nSmoochy pretends to \"zoom\" the penis cookie through the air. \nSHELDON Rrrrrrrr! Look at me, kids! I'm flying to the moon! I'm flying to Mars! I'm flying to -- \nRandolph, whose face is now bright red, can't take it anymore. He runs onto the stage. He grabs the rocket cookie from Smoochy. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRANDOLPH Are you fucking blind?! It's a cock! Not a space ship! Cock! Cock! \nINT. STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER \nThree burly Kidnet security guards drag Randolph down the stairwell. They beat the shit out of him and toss him through the exit door. \nINT. FRANK STOKES' OFFICE - TIGHT ON NEW YORK POST FRONT PAGE - DAY \nThe headline reads: \"Rainbow Randolph Interrupts Smoochy Taping.\" The subhead reads: \"Runs Onstage Shouting Penis Related Obscenities.\" \nWIDE \nBurke sits on the couch next to Sheldon, reading the paper. He shakes his head in disgust. Nora sits in a chair near Stokes. \n", "test1_true": "Sheldon laughs.    Stokes and Nora sit stone-faced. \nSHELDON Anyhoo, I'd like to turn the floor over to my new agent, Mr. Burke Bennett. So... heeeeeere's Burke! \nSheldon applauds.    Burke stands. \nBURKE As you can imagine, my client has many concerns, not the least of which is studio security, but we can address that later. \nHe pats Sheldon's head like a dog. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBURKE See this guy, Frank? Take a good long look, 'cause this prick saved your life. Without him you'd be sitting in Kaplan's right now, sucking club soda through a paper straw. (to Nora) And, you -- you'd be organizing puppet shows for the brats at P.S. 86. Excuse me, honey. \nNORA There's no excuse for you. \nSHELDON Man, I love club soda. \nSheldon laughs, trying to lighten the mood.       Burke gives him an affectionate slap. \nSTOKES We've always managed to come to some sort of arrangement, Burke. Why the fireworks? \nBURKE 'Cause I'm holding all the gunpowder. I represent the man who created, owns, and controls every square inch of Smoochy the Rhino. \nBurke pours himself a drink from Stokes' private bar. \nBURKE God created Adam and what did he get? A fucking dud. My guy? He breathed life into a winner. And anyone who does a better job than God is gonna have a price. \nSHELDON Burke, of course, is in no way comparing me to God. \nBURKE Yes I am. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nNORA You seem to forget that we went out and found 'your guy.' Dug up his corpse. Handed him his own show when he couldn't sell his face to a photo booth. \nSHELDON To be fair, Nora, I was booked to open a car wash in Montauk. \nBURKE Oh, so you were doing him a favor? (chuckles) Allow me to untangle this web of shit! I don't care what his resume was, I don't care where you found him, I don't care if his last job was juggling apples for a hut full of Pygmies on the outskirts of the Congo... the fact is, he fits a bill and you need him. Like a hungry baby needs a big tit. And that, my friends, is why you're in a box with no ventilation. And that is why the rhino is going to get what he deserves. \nSTOKES What is that, exactly? \nBurke walks over to Stokes' desk and leans across it. He's an inch from Stokes' face. \nBURKE Heaven, hell, and everything in between. \nINT. SPINNER DUNN'S RESTAURANT - CLOSE ON CHAMPAGNE CORK - EVENING \nbeing popped as foamy champagne runs down the bottle. \nWIDE \nSheldon and Burke sit at a table in the nightclub.    Burke raises his glass. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBURKE To the star and new executive producer of the Smoochy show! May your reign be a long and healthy one! \nThey clink glasses. \nSHELDON I'm still in shock. Complete creative control, part ownership of the show, discretion over merchandising and a dressing room with a toilet! Am I dreaming or what? \nBURKE And don't forget the corporate penthouse. It took me six years to get that for Randolph. \nSHELDON Boy, imagine... me, living in a penthouse. Who'd a thunk it. \nBURKE It's called the high life, kid. Get used to it. Pretty soon you'll be burnin' one hundred dollar bills just to see Franklin break a sweat. \nSHELDON Jeez, I hope not. I have a deep respect for money. Not to mention Ben Franklin who had some remarkable achievements in his lifetime. \nBurke pulls out a paper bag and hands it to Sheldon. \nSHELDON What's this? \nBURKE That's your graduation present. Something you're gonna need now. \nSheldon reaches in the bag and pulls out a revolver.

SPINNER DUNN'S - EVENING \nWe are TIGHT ON the feet of an Irish dancer doing a sort of Riverdance. We WIDEN OUT and the rest of the dancers come INTO FRAME. Spinner and the mob ar clapping and whooping. \nSheldon and Burke sit at a table in the dark club having a conversation. \nSHELDON Burke, I never agreed to do an ice show. \nBURKE Shel, do you know what kind of cash we'll take in between the gate and concessions? A venture like this gets you money and muscle. Times twenty. \nSHELDON Ice shows represent everything I'm against. They're mindless spectacles whose main purpose is to sell overpriced sugar-water and cheap plastic toys that splinter in a kid's mouth on the ride home. \nBURKE Look, I know you got this fetish for ethics, but now's not the time to fly that kite. No one's ever refused a shot at an ice show. \nSheldon tears the contract in half. \nSHELDON Until now. Smoochy doesn't sell out, Burke. You should be proud of that. Proud that you represent a client who paves driveways, not paints them over. \nBURKE I'm thrilled, Shel. Knocked out. \nBurke just sits there, stunned.   A waitress, SANDY, passes by the booth. \nSHELDON I'll have a pineapple juice, Sandy. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSANDY Pineapple? What happened to orange juice? \nSHELDON I'm feeling feisty tonight. \nINT. TELEVISION STUDIO - DAY \nWe are now on a drum solo. Ernie the Elephant of the Smoochyland Band works it. The animal band plays a sloppy version of \"Pop Goes the Weasel.\" End on Spinner Dunn -- the newest and by far largest member of the band. Spinner holds s cowbell and seems to be concentrating intently on the proper moment to hit it. Unfortunately, his rhythm is off, which throws the rest of the band off as well. \nWe WIDEN OUT to see Smoochy and the Rhinettes attempting to dance to the off-kilter rhythm. The song finally ends. The Rhinettes glare at Spinner. Smoochy addresses the camera. \nSMOOCHY Boy, wasn't that fun? In an awkward kind of way? Anyhoo, how 'bout a big round of applause for the newest member of the Smoochyland Band... former heavyweight contender, Spinner Dunn! \nSpinner stands up to take a bow and almost knocks the entire bandstand over. There is a smattering of confused applause from the kids in the bleachers. Spinner drops the cowbell and it clangs on the studio floor. \nSPINNER Shit.   Sorry. \nINT. BACKSTAGE - AFTER SHOW \nA beaming Spinner runs up to Sheldon, who's still in costume. \nSPINNER Did I do good, Sheldon, huh?   Did I do good? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHELDON Yeah, that was great, Spinner. Just watch your elbow next time. Pinky's probably gonna lose that tooth. \nSPINNER Okey doke.   I'm gonna go get drunk now. \nSpinner skips off humming \"Pop Goes the Weasel\" and banging his cowbell. Nora passes Sheldon backstage. \nNORA Nice job. Casting the show with mental patients, I like that. \nSHELDON (snapping) He is not a mental patient. He's an ex-boxer and nightclub owner who happens to have the sweet innocent brian of a five-year-old! \nNORA Excuse me for not making the distinction. \nShe leaves. \nEXT. BROADWAY (TIMES SQUARE) - NIGHT \nSheldon exits the Kidnet building and walks to the curb to hail a cab. A friendly-looking man in a suit and bow tie approaches him.

LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nSheldon slides into the back seat of the limo. A big thug in an overcoat, HENRY, is already sitting there. Merv gets in behind him and shuts the door. Sheldon is now wedged between the two men as the limo heads down Broadway. Merv extends his hand. \nMERV Merv Green, Sheldon. It's a pleasure to meet you. \nSHELDON If you're hoping for an autograph, the gun's a bit much. The whole 'catch more flies with honey' thing -- it really holds water. \nSheldon laughs nervously. \nMERV Sheldon, I represent the Parade of Hope Foundation. Maybe you've heard of us. \nSHELDON You raise money to build children's hospitals, right? \nMERV We've been known to add a brick or two, sure. \nMerv and the thug laugh. \nMERV Sheldon, let me get right to the point -- there's talk on the street that you're pulling out of the ice show. Is that true? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHELDON (big sigh) You know, I never agreed to an ice show, nor would I ever agree to do an ice show, and let me add that none of this is your concern, sir. (shakes his head) Sheesh. \nMERV Listen carefully, son: Parade of Hope has sponsored every Kidnet ice show since 1964. We take a piece off the top and everybody walks away happy. So let's not buck history. \nSHELDON Well, I appreciate the offer, but for the gazillionth time, I'm not doing an ice show, so we have nothing to discuss. Now, if you'll just pull over, I'll get out and we'll say our toodley-dos. (to driver) Far corner, please. \nMERV Allow me to be less murky. Starting tomorrow, Smoochy the Rhino raises his baton for Parade of Hope. Benefits, banquets, fund-raisers, I want it all. (to driver) Pull over, Terry. \nThe car pulls to the curb. \nMERV And as far as the ice show goes... I recommend you start shopping for skates. \nThe door pops open and Sheldon is tossed out. \nINT. CORPORATE PENTHOUSE - NIGHT \nA troubled-looking Sheldon stands on his balcony looking out at the city. He drinks orange juice straight from the carton. \nSheldon is on the phone with Burke. \nSHELDON This is unacceptable, Burke!    I'm calling the authorities. \nBURKE (V.O.) Don't do it, Shel. You rat on Parade of Hope and you'll be lucky if they find your toenails. These guys are the roughest of all the charities. \nSHELDON I was threatened by an organization that's supposed to help children! What kind of world is this? \nBURKE (V.O.) The real one. My advice? Consider the ice show and stay healthy. \nBurke hangs up. After a beat, Sheldon's DOORBELL RINGS. He walks over to the door and opens it. To his surprise, Nora is standing there. \nNORA May I come in? \nSHELDON Sure. \nNora enters. She seems a little wobbly.    Sheldon notices she's holding a pint of whiskey. \nSHELDON Uh... are you okay? \nNORA I'm getting drunk and I'm not used to it. \nSHELDON Oh. Well, not to make you feel worse, but with alcohol you're also consuming empty calories. \nNora looks at him for a moment. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nNORA It's just that... I want to apologize, actually. And on those rare occasions when I feel the need to apologize for something, it helps if I'm, you know... shit- faced. \n", "test2_id": 142, "test3_input": "RANDOLPH (mouthing to Nora) I tried. \nSheldon stuffs some extra bullets in his pocket. \nSHELDON (to Randolph) Okay, buddy, we have to get down to the Garden. You're welcome to stay here as long as you like. Just don't leave until I get things squared away. \nRandolph gets up and walks over to him. \nRANDOLPH Be careful, Sheldon. Remember what I told you -- you've only scratched the surface of this scummy business. You have yet to strike oil. \nRandolph looks at him for a moment before turning to Nora. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRANDOLPH You're lucky to have a guy like Smoochy. \nNORA You just rest, Randolph. \nRANDOLPH He's the real thing. Smoochy's the real thing. And I've been a fraud. A wicked man doing wicked acts. \nSheldon slaps the cylinder into place and tucks the gun in his waistband. \nSHELDON Well, we all have our bad days. \nHe exits. \nINT. HAWAII KAI - LATER THAT EVENING \nA hula dancer performs on a tiny stage in the nightclub. A small Hawaiian string band plays behind her. Burke and a nervous-looking Stokes sit in a booth. \nSTOKES Things are getting out of hand. We have to cover our tracks. \nBURKE Relax, everything's gonna work out. \nSTOKES Relax? They found Merv Green's head on the Grand Concourse! Excuse my concern. \nBURKE Look, we can cover all the tracks we want, but in the end we still got the same problem. We gotta finish what we started. \nSTOKES God help us... \nStokes shakily takes a sip of his drink. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBURKE It'll all be over tonight. Buggy's gonna take care of everything. \nSTOKES Buggy? Buggy Ding-Dong? The guy who hosted 'Buggy's Bumpy Railroad'? \nSTOKES Yeah, until he discovered the joys of Turkish black mule heroin. For the right price he'll do anything. It's amazing the guy's still alive. \nStokes buries his head in his hands. \nSTOKES I don't know, Burke... this whole thing... \nA shadow falls across their table.    Burke looks up. \nBURKE Speak of the devil. Have a seat, Bug. \nBuggy Ding-Dong's hand ENTERS the FRAME and snubs out his Camel. Stokes looks up. \nSTOKES (attempting to sound cheerful) Buggy. You're looking good. \nANGLE ON BUGGY \nA man who looks like he would first kill you then eat you for dinner, slides into the booth next to Stokes. \nBURKE It's time we put this thing to rest, Frank. And the way I see it... the rhino's up past his bedtime. \nBurke hands a folded envelope to Buggy who puts it into his jacket pocket. He lights another Camel. \nEXT.

Angelo works free from the ropes that have bound his wrists. He has been hit over the head and is groggy as he reaches for the phone. \nINT. SHELDON'S PENTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nA freshly showered Randolph is wearing Sheldon's robe and has a pink towel wrapped around his head as he lounges on the living room sofa. He's eating grapes and reading National Geographic. The PHONE RINGS. He picks it up. \nRANDOLPH (sing-songy) Hellooo! \nWe GO TO a SPLIT-SCREEN with Angelo. \nANGELO Randy, is that you? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRANDOLPH Yes, Angelo, my little Twinkie, shouldn't you be getting ready for the big show? \nANGELO Listen, Buggy's been here. \nRANDOLPH Buggy Double D's?   The Dong Man? \nANGELO Yeah, he lifted my backstage pass and he's braggin' that he's doing some kind of job for Burke Bennett. \nRandolph thinks.    He suddenly looks very worried. \nRANDOLPH Sheldon's in trouble.   I gotta get down to the Garden. \nANGELO The place is crawling with cops. They'll jump on you like a trampoline. \nRANDOLPH I don't care. \nHe rips the towel from his head. \nRANDOLPH I have to warn the rhino. \nINT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - BASEMENT \nBuggy, in his ill-fitting Rhinette costume, emerges from the sub-basement carrying a thin suitcase. As far as anyone's concerned, he's just another usher. He heads for the stairwell. \nINT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nEvery seat in the arena is occupied. The lights are lowered. A slow rolling TYMPANY is heard. After a moment, the Rhinettes skate out to enthusiastic applause. \nBACKSTAGE \nSheldon, looking very intense, stands alone in the wings. He takes a couple of deep breaths. We TILT DOWN and see the bulge of the revolver under his Smoochy costume. \nICE RINK \nThe Rhinettes have formed a line across the middle of the rink. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) And now... it gives us great pleasure to introduce America's favorite rhino... ladies and gentlemen... boys and girls... (dramatic pause) Heeeeere's Smoochy! \nSmoochy skates out to thunderous applause. The entire arena is on its feet. The Rhinettes part as Smoochy skates through them and stops in the middle of the rink. The applause and cheering don't stop for several moments. One of the Rhinettes hands Smoochy a microphone. \nSMOOCHY On behalf of myself, the Rhinettes, and the soon to be restored Coney Island Methadone Center, I thank you all for coming. \nNETWORK BOX \nBurke and Stokes roll their eyes. \nBACK ON SHELDON \nSMOOCHY It was my original intention that tonight's performance would be a benign mix of Smoochy songs and ice dancing. But as an artist, I believe I must convey to you, my fans, what I'm feeling at any given moment in my life. To do otherwise would be dishonest. Art is communication. It's something we learn and hopefully grow from. With that in mind... I hope you enjoy the show. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMore applause as Smoochy skates over to the Rhinettes. They form a circle around him and slap hands in solidarity. \nSHELDON This is for Spinner. \nThe lights go down. A full orchestra begins to play the overture to WAGNER's Tristen et Isolde. The lights come up as a soprano -- a heavyset woman in a modified rhino costume -- skates out through the fog and begins singing the opera. Smoochy -- now wearing a peasant's frock -- skates an interpretive dance in the b.g. with a few Rhinettes who are also dressed as peasants. A beautiful fairy princess floats down (on filament wire) from the rafters and takes Smoochy's hand. She skates away with him as he waves good-bye to the Rhinettes. \nHIGH ANGLE \nLOOKING DOWN AT the opera. The CAMERA PANS OVER TO the catwalk high above the rink. \nCATWALK \nBuggy Ding-Dong, still in his Rhinette costume, settles into his assassin's roost.

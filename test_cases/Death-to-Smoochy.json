{"test1_input": "STOKES Sap's just the pill we need right now. Mopes is a straight arrow. Always has been. \nNORA The guy can't get arrested, Frank. He can't even break into the birthday party circuit. Last I heard he was working hospitals and nursing homes. He's a joke. \nStokes stands up and walks around the room. \nSTOKES The truth of the matter is, a successful children's show has always depended on two simple elements: a fuzzy costume and a lot of hype. Strip away the foam rubber and the network money and they're all jokes. Marginal talents.. cabaret acts... off- Broadway runoff... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nNORA I probably have ten acts in my development file -- acts I've been cultivating -- that are more deserving than Sheldon Mopes. \nSTOKES And each one a moral question mark. Something I can't risk at the moment. \nNORA (frustrated) We can do better than this guy, Frank. He brings nothing to the table. \nSTOKES Except ethics. With Mopes, there's never been a whiff of controversy. The man's an ethical, harmless, cornball. In short, a glass of milk on two legs. \nStokes stops pacing. \nNORA Don't ask me to do it. You know I'll do anything for you, but please... not this... \nStokes gazes out the window at the city. \nSTOKES Go find Smoochy. \nEXT. CONEY ISLAND - EARLY EVENING \nThe lighted Ferris wheel spins CENTER FRAME. We CRANE DOWN and eventually LAND ON a side street with the amusement park looming in the b.g. We're in FRONT of a small building. The half-lit neon sign reads: CONEY ISLAND METHADONE CENTER. We DRIFT THROUGH the double doors THROUGH the reception area where random junkies loiter and fill out paperwork. We CONTINUE DOWN a narrow hallway as the faint sound of someone SINGING and playing the GUITAR INCREASES. We finally burst THROUGH another set of doors marked \"Treatment Room.\" The singing now fills our ears as we PUSH IN ON the \"performer\" -- a big, puffy, orange rhinoceros. Smoochy. Or to be more specific, SHELDON MOPES. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSmoochy sits on a stool with his guitar and sings to the patients as they stand in line before a sliding glass window, where a nurse hands each person a little cup of methadone which they immediately drink. \nThe Smoochy costume is a mass of misshapen orange foam rubber that exposes Sheldon's painted face in the front. A multi-colored horn protrudes from his forehead. \nSMOOCHY (SHELDON) (singing to the tune of 'She'll be Comin' round the Mountain') 'We'll get that monkey off your back, Yes we will, yes we will We'll get that monkey off your back, Yes we will...' \n'We'll get that monkey off your back And get your life right back on track If you'll just give up the smack Yes you will, yes you will!!' \nThe song ends.       A few baffled junkies applaud. \nSMOOCHY Thanks, fellas. I'm rooting for you! \nWe PAN AWAY FROM Sheldon TO the exit.      Standing there in her coat, looking mortified, is Nora. \nINT. RECEPTION AREA - SHORT WHILE LATER \nNora sits in the reception area. Sheldon emerges in his street clothes. He carries Smoochy's body on a hanger over his shoulder and carries a large shopping bag which holds Smoochy's head. \nNORA Mr. Mopes? \nSheldon stops. \nSHELDON Yeah? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nNORA I, uh, saw your performance tonight. Very... (searching) ... spirited. \nSHELDON Really? Thanks. I would've done a longer set if that guy hadn't pulled a knife on the security guard. Once the pepper spray starts flyin', that's it for the encores. \nNORA Yes, that did put a damper on the evening, didn't it? \nSHELDON Are you a new patient?   On the juice, as we say? \nNORA Ah, no. But it's sweet of you to assume so. \nShe hands him her card.     He reads it. \nSHELDON 'Nora Bishop. V.P. of Development. Kidnet.' (to Nora) Good gravy. You work for Kidnet? \nNORA As stated. \nSheldon grabs her hand and shakes it. \nSHELDON Well, it's a pleasure to meet you, Nora. A real honor. Hey, you hungry? \nEXT. CONEY ISLAND BOARDWALK - NATHAN'S HOT DOGS - SHORT WHILE LATER \n", "test1_true": "(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHELDON (with full mouth) Soy dogs... never thought I'd live to see the day. Organic, rich in natural protein, and nobody gets killed. Although I do feel bad for the beans. Just kidding. Sure you don't want one? \nNORA Believe it or not, no. \nHe takes another bite. \nSHELDON So anyway, like I was saying, people always tell me, 'You gotta network, Sheldon... you gotta sell yourself... or you'll be playing the drug clinics and shopping centers the rest of your life.' And you know what I tell 'em? \nNORA I haven't the foggiest. \nSHELDON I tell 'em, it's not about the old handshake and back slap game. It's not about adding fuel to the shlock machine. It's about doing good work. Having integrity. Making people happy and delivering a positive message. Foundations are built with concrete, not plaster of Paris! \nHe pulls the stained, misshapen Smoochy head from the shopping bag. \nSHELDON This is concrete!   This is integrity! \nNORA (calmly) I can see that. \nSheldon realizes his voice was getting too loud. \nSHELDON Sorry. As you can imagine, living by your convictions can be a little stressful at times. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nNORA We all have our cross to bear. \nSHELDON See, I was raised by my grandfather, and Grandpop paved driveways for a living... \nNORA Are we going into a story? \nSHELDON Thing is, he didn't really pave them. Just covered them with black paint. Of course, once the first rain came along, people realized they'd been swindled. I vowed to myself back then that I'd never make a living through deception. Never. Whadda ya think of them apples? \nNora looks glassy-eyed.      She takes a deep breath. \nNORA The reason I'm here today, Mr. Mopes, as fate would have it, Kidnet is currently looking for a performer with... convictions. And integrity. Someone like... \nShe almost chokes on the word. \nNORA ... yourself. \nSheldon laughs. \nSHELDON Yeah, right. Got any more jokes? \nNORA I don't think I could top that one. \nSHELDON Hold the phone. You're telling me that Kidnet is finally ready to do a show of Smoochy quality? Of Smoochy caliber? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nNORA (dryly) Yes... I believe we're ready to push ourselves to that level. \nSHELDON I knew this day   would come! After all these   years I finally meet someone in   the business who gets what I do.    Who gets what I'm all about. You    get me, don't you, Nora? \nNORA I'm afraid so. \nSHELDON Well, Miss V.P. of Development... let's go make history! \nCUT TO: \nPREP MONTAGE \nKIDNET STUDIO WARDROBE ROOM. A team of designers and seamstresses cut, sew and shape endless sheets of orange foam rubber. Sheldon stands on a wooden box as he's measured from head to toe. On the wall is a blueprint labeled \"Smoochy the Rhino -- REDESIGN.\" \nA costume designer walks over with the new Smoochy head and places it on Sheldon. \nAs seamstresses fit him with the new Smoochy costume, various signs and billboards FLOAT THROUGH the FRAME, trumpeting copy like: \"IT'S ALMOST SMOOCHY TIME!\" \"GET READY TO BE SMOOCHED, AMERICA!\" \"ONLY TWO MORE WEEKS TILL SMOOCHY!\" \nKIDNET STUDIO -C. \nSets, props, and camera equipment are rolled into the studio. Through a SERIES of DISSOLVES we see the Smoochyland Magic Jungle take shape. \nKIDNET STUDIO -C - LATER \nA choreographer maps out a number for Smoochy and the \"Rhinettes.\" (The Rhinettes are the former Krinkle Kid little people with horns strapped to their foreheads.) \n(CONTINUED) \n", "test1_id": 141, "test2_input": "She keeps walking. Sheldon catches up and walks alongside her, occasionally getting jostled by passersby. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHELDON Good meeting today. I thought we tackled some hot issues. Although, I'll be honest, there were a few times that I felt my voice wasn't being heard. \nNORA I think that's a conservative estimate. \nSHELDON I just want the show to have some weight, you know? Some substance. Silly songs, sure -- but with a message. Pop quiz: How many original compositions are in the Smoochy songbook? \nNORA Do you sense my complete lack of interest? \nSHELDON Try two thousand. Covering every topic from how yummy vegetables are to the importance of donating plasma. Don't you get it, Nora? I'm a valuable resource. Use me. \nNora stops.    She looks Sheldon in the eye for the first time. \nNORA Can I make this real easy for you? \nSHELDON Sure. \nNORA The only reason you're on TV right now is because Rainbow Randolph is a degenerate scumbag. I didn't discover you, I delivered you. Like a bag of groceries. I have a bigger emotional investment in my nail polish. So don't peddle your sap to me, rhino. Your job is just to smile and nod your head. \nShe walks off. \nINT. PATSY'S - NIGHT \nSheldon sits at the bar in the restaurant, nursing a drink and talking to the BARTENDER. He seems slightly drunk. \nSHELDON ... No, no, you misunderstand me. It's not that I'm literally comparing Captain Kangaroo to Jesus Christ. I'm just saying that the Captain, like Christ, was someone you could believe in. Those guys didn't care about bells and whistles and rickita-rackata. It was all about the work. Especially Jesus. Forget about it. \nThe Bartender nods and starts to pour Sheldon another drink. \nSHELDON (waving him off) That's okay, my good man.    Three's my limit. \nBARTENDER I never saw anyone get loaded on orange juice before. \nSHELDON Back in my college days I could put away a carton of the stuff. \nA sharply-dressed man, BURKE BENNETT, sits down next to Sheldon. \nBURKE (to Bartender) Gimme a Five Crown. \nThe Bartender nods.    He looks over at Sheldon. \nBURKE Smoochy the Rhino.    Wow.   I'm a big fan. \nSHELDON (flattered) Gee, thanks. I usually don't get recognized without my horn. \nBurke extends his hand. \nBURKE Burke Bennett.    I represent kid show talent. \nINT. PATSY'S - SHORT WHILE LATER \nSheldon and Burke now sit at a corner table. \nBURKE Look, Shel, Frank Strokes ain't in the business to make you rich. He's in it to make Frank Stokes rich. That's how these network goons operate. \nSHELDON That's so sad. Is it just me, or is that sad? \nBURKE You know, years ago, a client of mine, Dicky Gimble, was having a problem... \nSHELDON Wow, you represented Dicky Gimble? \nBURKE Yeah, before the asshole found religion. Anyway, Stokes was trying to screw my boy out of some merchandising points. Claimed he had a warehouse full of Dicky dolls that weren't moving. Now Frank and I are old friends, so I say to him, 'Okay, cock, show me the warehouse' -- see, I know the fucking warehouse is in the Bronx, and I know it's emptier than my wife's head. (chuckles) To make a long story short, I walk out with a check for a hundred grand and Stokes is sitting there with his thumb up his ass. \nBurke laughs. \nSHELDON That's very amusing, but I don't care about Smoochy dolls and Smoochy floor wax... I just want more creative input. This rhino came from my womb. I bore him, I nursed him, and dammit... \nHe pounds his fist on the table. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHELDON I should be the one who raises him! \nBURKE Shel, it's all about the dough. After you get the money, you get the power. And after you get the power, you can have Smoochy walk on stage with a hard-on if you want. \nSHELDON It's funny, that never crossed my mind. \nBurke downs the rest of his drink and stands up. \n", "test2_true": "He hands Sheldon his card. \nBURKE Give me a call when you're ready, kid. I'll cut the strings and open the magic door for you. \nEXT. PATSY'S - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nRandolph peers through the restaurant's front window. He shivers from the cold as he watches Sheldon and Burke shake hands. Burke heads for the exit. Randolph quickly ducks into the shadows. A moment later, Burke exits the club and walks down the street. Randolph pops out. \nRANDOLPH I saw you! I saw you in there... at my table... talking to him. \nBURKE Yeah, so what do you want?    A parade? \nRANDOLPH You're my agent! Or did you forget that? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBURKE Not anymore, pal. You're a cigarette butt. Go lay in the gutter. \nBurke walks off. \nEXT. ALLEY - NIGHT \nIn the litter-strewn alley, we PAN ACROSS several grocery bags, broken egg shells, flour bags, butter wrappers, mixing bowls and other baking ingredients. The PAN ENDS ON Randolph, who stands over a barrel fire, holding a spatula. A cookie sheet rests on the barrel. Randolph removes the cookie sheet and gazes at it gleefully. We now see that the cookies are phallic-shaped. \nRANDOLPH Ah! They're beautiful! A perfect batch of cock cookies for a very special rhino. \nHe sets the tray aside. \nRANDOLPH Oh yes, you're going to learn about shame, my dear Smoochy.   And I'm your professor. \nHe laughs. \nINT. KIDNET STUDIO - STAGE B - DAY \nIt's thirty minutes before a Smoochy taping. Dozens of giddy children are led into the studio where they take seats on the bleachers. \nBACKSTAGE \nSheldon, in the Smoochy costume, sans head, lumbers up to Nora. He holds a rundown for that day's show. \nSHELDON Excuse me, Nora. Why was the 'Please and Thank You Song' cut? \nNORA Because it's sappy and it takes away from the 'Cookie Song.' \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHELDON Takes away? It enhances it! The cookie song is a meaningless piece of fluff without the 'Please and Thank You' coda! That's the moral anchor! That's where the lesson is! You can't sell the sizzle without the steak! \nNORA It's cut. And I want the 'Cookie Song' lyrics changed back to the way they were originally scripted. \nSHELDON I can't do that. I will not condone children consuming endless amounts of refined sugar. I have to look myself in the mirror every morning. \nNORA This is network television, not a sprout farm. We're here to sell sugar and plastic. That's what keeps the lights on. \nSHELDON You're treating me like a puppet. You know that? Well, guess what? I am not your puppet. \nNORA Since when? Now get your spongy orange ass out there and dance for the cameras. \nAn angry Sheldon storms off in frustration, but then stops. He looks back at her. \nSHELDON We have different eyes, Nora. When I go out there I see kids. You see wallets with pigtails. \nHe moves on. Nora stares at him as he walks away. He obviously got to her. As Sheldon heads toward the studio, he doesn't notice the two beady eyes staring at him from under the stairwell. After a beat, Randolph emerges and slinks backstage. He's clutching a duffle bag. \nINT. PROP ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nRandolph sneaks into the prop room and shuts the door. He scurries over to the prop shelf and locates Smoochy's multicolored \"magic cookie bag.\" He opens it and tosses the cookies into the trash can. Reaching into his pockets, he pulls out his special homemade cookies. He chuckles as he dumps them into the magic cookie bag. \nRANDOLPH Bon soir, la Smoochy.   Welcome to fatty Arbuckle-land. \nHe cackles to himself. He then notices a box in the corner of the room. Scribbled in magic marker on the side are the words: \"Rainbow Randolph crap.\" He walks over and pulls the box out. He slowly opens the flaps. Inside is his old costume. He pulls it out and clutches it lovingly. He smells it. The ECHOEY SOUND of his THEME SONG comes flooding back to him for a moment, along with the sound of CHILDREN LAUGHING. \nRANDOLPH (softly to himself) Don't worry, little ones. Rainbow Randolph will return... (with rising anger) After these messages! \nHe holds up Smoochy's magic cookie bag.   He then stuffs his old costume into his duffle bag. \nINT. STUDIO B - LATER \nThe \"Smoochy Show\" is in the middle of a taping. The Smoochyland Band is playing a fast, jazzy number (\"Doin' the Jiggy Ziggy\") as Smoochy, the Rhinettes, and several kids dance frenetically. The kids in the bleachers are in hysterics as Smoochy shakes his body spastically. The song finally ends. The kids in the bleachers jump to their feet, cheering and applauding. \nSMOOCHY Boy, all that jiggyin' and ziggyin' sure makes a fella hungry! Now if only I had my super duper, super secret, super special... \n", "test2_id": 142, "test3_input": "BURKE Like they say, rock bottom's a college education. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHELDON But here's the really good news: I'm doing it myself. No sponsors, no vendors, no crooks. Not one dirty hand will touch this. Not one person will make a dollar off these kids. Smoochy on Ice will be a study in purity. \nBurke's grin suddenly fades. \nSHELDON As far as food concessions go, I'll supply the refreshments. For free. Low sodium, whole wheat pretzels and apple slices. Healthy stuff. Now are you ready for the best part? \nBURKE I'm holding my breath. \nSHELDON All profits from ticket sales will be used to built a state-of-the- art methadone clinic in Coney Island. \nBurke looks pale. \nSHELDON I'm not just talking a run-of-the- mill clinic... I'm going to build a methadone palace. A place where men and women can withdraw in luxury. \nBURKE Sheldon, you can't do an ice show and cut out the vendors. And more importantly, you can't cut out the Parade of Hope. It's suicide. \nSHELDON You always told me, when you've got muscles you make the rules. Well, I'm feeling pretty strong right now. \nSheldon rises and tosses his napkin down. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHELDON All this time I was letting the business use me. Well, I think it's time I start using the business. I've got my clout back and I'm not gonna waste it this time. Take care of it, Burke. \nSheldon exits.    Burke sits there, looking very concerned. \nOn his way out the door, Tommy stops Sheldon.       Spinner's COWBELL CLANGING continues. \nTOMMY Shel, you gotta help me out. He bangs that goddamn thing from morning till night. I got a headache that goes from my eyes to my ass. \nSHELDON Whatever I can do, Tommy, just say it. You know I love Spinner. And I owe you. \nTOMMY Give the boy something else to do on the show. Anything. Just as long as it don't clang, chime or honk. \nINT. STOKES' OFFICE - TIGHT ON FACE OF FRANK STOKES - DAY \nfrightened.    There's a gun to his temple. \nWIDER \nChick, the Asian representative of Takashi, holds a revolver on Stokes. His cohorts, Sambo and Tobi, stand by. \nCHICK I don't like complications, Frank. You got one week to get Takashi that slot or you're gonna be shakin' hands with Buddha. \nSTOKES Don't you understand? My hands are tied. The rhino's been exonerated. The show's more popular than ever. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCHICK (to Sambo and Tobi) Okay, boys, chop him up, bag him and dump him in the woods. \nSambo and Tobi start to advance on Stokes. \nSTOKES All right! I'll take care of it! I just need time! \nChick leans into Stokes' face. \nCHICK One week, Jeeves. Got that? Or I get a blender and make an Orange Julius with your feet. \nThey exit. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nA down-and-out Randolph shuffles along in ratty bedroom slippers. He passes a MAN who sits behind a small table on the sidewalk. The table has a huge photograph of a rhinoceros taped in front of it. Literature and pamphlets depicting the black rhino are spread out on the table. \nMAN Save the rhino! Before it's too late! Make a donation! Save the rhino! (to Randolph) Hey, mister, ya wanna help save the rhino? \nRandolph just looks at him for a moment. He looks at all the rhino-related imagery. He starts shaking and suddenly jumps over the table and attacks the Man. \nRANDOLPH I'm the one who needs to be saved! Me. I'm broke! I lost my lawyer! My only friend kicked me out! I'm a fucking peanut shell in the shape of a man! Save the Rainbow! Save the Rainbow! Save the Rainbow! \nMAN Help!   Someone call a cop! \nRandolph grabs the collection can and runs off. \nEXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY \n", "test3_true": "STOKES Your client is suffocating me. To make matters worse, he's caused me to veer into a hazardous situation. A situation that otherwise could have a very happy ending. \nBURKE Tell me more about the Asians. \nSTOKES They're ruthless. Unwavering. Unprincipled. And best of all, they know how the game is played. They respect our delicate ecosystem of mutual benefit. \nStokes stops walking and grabs Burke's arm. \nSTOKES I'd bring you in on this, Burke. You'd be my partner on the Takashi deal. Split down the middle. We have an opportunity to get back on track here. Back to the way it was. \nBURKE The good old days. \nSTOKES Pre-rhinoceros. \nThe two men look at each other as thoughts pass silently between them. \nBURKE This is very sticky ground we're about to walk on. \nSTOKES Well, you're used to a little glue on your shoes. \nBurke smiles. \nBURKE Let me poke around. Sift through the possibilities. \nOMITTED \nEXT. ALLEY OFF ND STREET - THEATER STAGE DOOR - EVENING \nA slender young man in a Peter Pan costume in being held by a big thug as another thug beats him up. A girl dressed as Tinkerbell (also being restrained) looks on in horror. Merv Green (Parade of Hope) steps INTO FRAME. \nMERV This is what happens to guys who keep secrets, Johnny. \nJOHNNY I'll give you the rest next week! I promise! \nMERV It's not me you're fucking over, it's sick kids. You got something against sick kids, Johnny? \nThe thug punches him in the stomach again. \nJOHNNY No!   I love sick kids! \nMerv nods to one of the thugs who releases Peter Pan.   He slumps to the ground. Merv kneels down and lifts his head from the pavement. \nMERV And you tell that fat producer of yours, if he ever gives me a low head count again, he'll lose the other thumb. \nOne of Merv's thugs leans in, whispers something to Merv, who looks up to see. \nBurke standing in the mouth of the alley. \nBURKE Merv Green. How's tricks, kid? \nMERV Well, if it ain't smilin' Burke. Whose bones are you pickin' today? \nBURKE (chuckles) You got a minute, pally? \nOMITTED \nEXT. ND STREET - MOMENTS LATER \nBurke and Merv walk along 42nd Street. A poster advertises Peter Pan \"Sponsored by Parade of Hope -- Giving Children the Gift of Promise!\" Merv's thugs trail behind. \nMERV No one freezes me out of an ice show. No one. I don't care how many fucking clinics he's trying to save. \nBURKE Look, I'm chokin' on the same bone as you. \nMERV If you're trying to aggravate me, you're doing a hell of a job. \nBURKE I'm not here to aggravate, just educate. I think Mopes might be talking to people he shouldn't be talking to. \nMERV That's an ugly string of words. \nBURKE He's got it in his head that he's gonna clean up the way we do business. (beat) Truthfully? I wouldn't be surprised if he's wearing a wire. \nBurke looks at his watch. \nBURKE Jesus, I got a thing across town. \nHe steps off the curb to hail a cab. \nBURKE Let's keep talking, Merv. There's oughta be some kind of solution. Don't you think? \nBurke hops into a cab.   Merv watches the cab pull away. \nEXT. TIMES SQUARE - OUTSIDE KIDNET BUILDING - TIGHT SHOT - LEGS OF SMALL CARD TABLE - MORNING \nSNAP open. The table is set on the sidewalk.

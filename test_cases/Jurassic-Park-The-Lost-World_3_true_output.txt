Malcolm runs over and hurls himself at the rock face, scrambling to climb up the smooth, steep boulders. 
Behind him, one of the rexes spots him and lunges across the camp toward him. 
ROLAND (cont'd) FASTER!! 
Malcolm gives it everything he's got, clawing his way up the rock face -- 
-- and rex draws closer and pounces at his legs -- 
-- and Roland reaches down, grabs Malcolm by the hair and pulls him up, out of the rex's grasp. 
The rex falls short, but he's close enough that we can hear his teeth SNAP together, closing around nothing but air.  It turns, sees easier prey in the fleeing Hunters, and takes off after them. 
Malcolm lands on top of the rock ledge with a CRUNCH.  Roland unceremoniously dumps a fistful of hair in his lap. 
IN THE RAVINE, 
Kelly, in the middle of the fleeing crowd with Sarah and Nick, hears her father screaming her name and looks up.  Malcolm and Roland are on the rock ridge above them, keeping pace. 
MALCOLM (shouting) KELLY, UP HERE! 
But Kelly continues to flee, as the rexes are in the ravine now, and drawing closer to the group. 
Some Hunters try to leap up and scale the rocks, but the ravine is deepening, there's no way out.  One rex grabs hold of a Hunter in its teeth and hurls him against the rock face. 
The second rex picks up another Hunter and snaps its massive head left and right quickly, to break its victim's neck.  The Hunter goes flying forward and crashes into -- 
-- CARTER, Dieter's driver, who stumbles and falls.  The rest of the fleeing humans run around or over him, but when the rex lifts its foot, we see Carter is actually stuck to the bottom of it -- 
-- and when the animal takes its next step it CRUSHES him into the earth. 
UP ON TH ROCK FACE, 
Malcolm is frantic. 
MALCOLM I gotta get down there! 
DOWN IN THE RAVINE, 
it's obvious no one is going to outrun the rexes, and Nick knows it.  He bursts ahead of Sarah and Kelly and spots something off to his left. 
It's a waterfall, apparently right in front of a sheer rock face.  But there's something about the way the water is falling that tells him something. 
NICK SARAH KELLY COME HERE! 
He grabs each of them and hauls them forward, running straight at the waterfall.  Apparently, he intends to jump right into the rock, and he's dragging them along with him. 
SARAH WHAT ARE YOU- 
NICK JUMP! 
The three of them spring right at the waterfall and disappear THROUGH the water. 
DR. BURKE, fleeing along with everyone else, is watching as they vanish. 
BEHIND THE WATERFALL, 
there is a small recess, which is what Nick had hoped for. It's small, only four or five feet deep, but it's just enough for him, Sarah, and Kelly to cover behind the flowing water. Breathless, terrified, they can hear the mayhem outside. 
NICK Shhhh... shhhh... 
With an enormous SPLASH, something bursts through the cascading water and crashes into them. 
Dr. Burke. 
BURKE Get out of the way! 
He pulls his way up against the far wall, as far away from the water as he can. 
FOOOOM!  Now another shape bursts through the watery curtain. 
A Tyrannosaur head.  Burke gave away the hiding spot. 
The four SCREAM as the rex's jaws SNAP left and right, searching for them, falling just inches short.  They squeeze as far back against the wall as they can get. 
The rex can't quite get its head all the way through the opening -- 
-- so it uses its tongue.  A long, dark blue shape slithers out of its mouth and touches the humans, trying to wrap around them, to pull them out of the cave. 
Burke, blind with panic, forces himself even further into the cave, which pushes Kelly further out. 
SARAH STOP IT YOU'RE PUSHED HER OUT STOP IT! 
But Burke doesn't listen, throwing elbows to make room for himself.  His movements dislodge a portion of muddy earth, and a flurry of enormous cockroaches, eight or nine inches long each, pour out of the wall and swarm over his face and neck. 
Burke SCREAMS and instinctively leaps away, toward the flowing water. 
And that's all the leverage the rex needs.  It curls its tongue, wrapping Burke up in it and pulling him between its teeth.  SCREAMING hideously, he is dragged out, through the waterfall, and disappears. 
Sarah, Nick, and Kelly stare in horror as the white screen of water turn pink. 
UP ON THE ROCK FACE,

{"train": "A SERIOUS MAN \nWritten by \nJoel Coen & Ethan Coen \nJune 4th, 2007 \nWhite letters on a black screen: Receive with simplicity everything that happens to you. \n-RASHI \nFADE IN: \nAGAINST BLACK: SNOWFLAKES \nThe flakes drift lazily down toward us. Our angle looks straight up. Now an angle looking steeply down: the snow falls not quite dead away to collect on a foreground chimneypot and on the little shtetl street that lies maplike below us. It is night, and quiet, and the street is deserted except for one man who walks away from us, his valenki squeaking in the fresh snow. He carries bundled branches on one shoulder and has a hatchet tucked into his belt. \nWe cut down to street level. The man walks toward us, bearded, and bundled against the cold. Smiling, he mutters in Yiddish-the dialogue subtitled. \nMAN What a marvel... what a marvel... \nHOUSE INTERIOR As its door opens and the man enters. \nMAN Dora! \nVOICE Yes... \nThe man crosses to the stove with his bundle of wood. The voice continues: \n. Can you help me with the ice? The man dumps the wood into a box by the stove as his wife enters with an ice pick. . I expected you hours ago. \nMAN You can't imagine what just happened. I was coming back on the Lublin road when the wheel came off the cart thank heavens it was the way back and I'd already sold the geese! \nWIFE How much? \nMAN Fifteen groshen, but that's not the story. I was struggling to set the cart upright when a droshky approaches from the direction of Lvov. How lucky, you think, that someone is out this late. \nWIFE Yes, very remarkable. \nMAN But that's the least of it! He stops to help me; we talk of this, we talk of that-it turns out this is someone you know! Traitle Groshkover! \nHis wife stares at him as he beams. He takes the stare as a sign that she can't place the name. . You know, REB GROSHKOVER! Pesel Bunim's uncle! The chacham from Lodz, who studied under the Zohar reb in Krakow! \nStill she stares. Then, quietly: \nWIFE God has cursed us. \nMAN What? \nD'VORAH Ahnee to yodayah. The TEACHER begins to pace the desk aisles, looking back and forth among the students. \nTEACHER Mee yodayah? The bugger-seeker, having succesfully withdrawn a bugger, carefully drapes it over the sharp end of his pencil, to what end we cannot know. DANNY, apprehensively eyeing the TEACHER, slides the twenty into the transistor radio's cover-sleeve. \nX-RAY CONE A huge white rubberized cone, pointed directly at us. We hear a rush of static and the DOCTOR's voice filtered through a talk-back: DOCTOR's Voice Hold still. Wider: LARRY is in his shorts lying on his back on an examining table covered by a sheet of tissue paper. The X-ray cone is pointed at the middle of his body. There is a brief sci-fi-like machine hum. It clicks off. \nHEBREW SCHOOL The clock-watching student's head is making descending bobs toward his chest. \nTEACHER Nefsheh shelach hamilamid-eh?! The TEACHER's circuit of the classroom has taken him around behind DANNY. DANNY's book lies face-down on the desk, covering the radio, but the white cord snakes out from under it up to his ear. The TEACHER yanks at the cord. \nThe cord pops out of its jack and the Jefferson Airplane blares tinnily from beneath the book of torah stories. The TEACHER lifts the book to expose the jangling radio. Outraged, the TEACHER projects above the music: . Mah zeh? ! Mah zeh? ! Some of the students are singing along; a couple beat rhythm on their desks. . Shechet, talmidim! Anachnoo lo cam zeh b'bait sefer! Shechet bivakasha! Three other students join in a chorus: \nSTUDENTS Shechet! Shechet bivakasha! The nodding student's head droops ever lower. Other students join in the chant: \nSHECHET! SHECHET! SHECHET BIVAKASHA! \nThe nodding student's chin finally reaches, and settles on, his chest, and he gives a long snorfling inhale of sleep. \nDOCTOR'S OFFICE LARRY, now fully clothed, is seated across from the DOCTOR. The DOCTOR is looking at his file. He absently taps a cigarette out of a pack and lights up. He nods as he smokes, looking at the file. \nDOCTOR Well, I-sorry. He holds the pack toward LARRY. \nLARRY No thanks. \nDOCTOR Well, you're in good health. How're Judith and the kids? \nLARRY Good. Everyone's good. You know. The DOCTOR takes a long suck. \nDOCTOR Good. Daniel must be-what? About to be bar mitzvah? \nLARRY Two weeks. \nDOCTOR Well, mazel tov. They grow up fast, don't they? \nTINTED PHOTO PORTRAIT The portrait, old, in an ornate gilt frame, is of a middle-aged rabbi with a small neat mustache and round spectacles. He wears a tallis hood-style and a phylactery box is strapped to his forehead. A plaque set into the frame identifies the man as Rabbi Minda. Wider shows that the portrait hangs in the Hebrew school principal's office, a white cinderblock room. It is quiet. The only sound is a deep electrical hum. Just visible behind the principal's desk, upon which is a low stack of books and a name plate identifying the occupant as MAR TURCHIK, is the top of a man's head-an old man, with a few whispy white hairs where his yarmulka is not. DANNY, seated opposite, pushes up from his slouch to better see across the desk. We boom up to show more of the principal. He is short. He wears a white shirt and hoist-up pants that come to just below his armpits. He has thick eyeglasses. He fiddles with the transistor radio, muttering: \nPRINCIPAL Hmm... eh... nu? \nHe experiments with different dials on the radio. DANNY nervously watches. \nDANNY You put the- The old man holds up one hand. \nPRINCIPAL In ivrit. (In Hebrew) \nDANNY Um... The old man looks down at the little earpiece pinched between two fingers. He examines it as a superstitious native might a Coca-Cola bottle. The source of the electrical hum: a wall clock whose red sweep-second hand crawls around the dial very, very slowly. The Reb continues to squint at the earpiece. DANNY sighs. He encourages: \nDANNY Yeah, you- The principal's tone is harder: \nPRINCIPAL In ivrit! This time his cold look holds until he is sure that the admonishment has registered. He looks back down at the earpiece. We hear the door open. The principal ignores it. An old woman walks slowly in with a teacup chattering on a saucer. She has thick eyeglasses. She wears thick flesh-colored support hose. She takes slow, short steps toward the desk. The principal is studying the radio. \nLARRY No no, I- \nCLIVE Or perhaps I can take the mid-term again. Now I know it covers mathematics. \nLARRY Well, the other students wouldn't like that, would they. If one student gets to retake the test til he gets a grade he likes. CLIVE impassively considers this. \nCLIVE Secret test. LARRY wraps a hand wearily over his eyes. \nLARRY . No, I'm afraid- \nCLIVE Hush-hush. \nLARRY No, that's just not workable. I'm afraid we'll just have to bite the bullet on this thing, CLIVE, and- \nCLIVE Very troubling. He rises. . very troubling... He goes to the door, shaking his head, as LARRY looks on in surprise. He leaves. LARRY stares at the open door. The secretary outside, her back to us, types on. LARRY. looks stupidly around his own office, shakes his head. He picks up the phone message from Sy Ableman-\"Let's talk\"-and dials. As he dials his other hand wanders over the papers on the desktop. There is a plain white envelope on the desk. LARRY picks it up as the phone rings through. A ring is clipped short and a warm basso-baritone rumbles through the line: Phone Voice Sy Ableman. \nLARRY Hello, Sy, LARRY Gopnik. \nSY \n(MOURNFUL) LARRY. How are you, my friend. LARRY picks idly at the envelope. \nLARRY Good, how've you been, Sy? \nInside the envelope: a thick sheaf of one-hundred-dollar bills. \nSY Oh fine. Shall we talk LARRY. LARRY reacts to the money. \nLARRY (into phone) What?! Oh! Sorry! I, uh-call back! He slams down the phone. \n. CLIVE! He rushes out the door, through the secretarial area, and into the hallway, and looks up toward the elevators. Empty. He looks at the stuffed envelope he still holds. He goes back to the departmental office. The secretary sits typing. She glances at him and, as she goes back to her typing: \nSECRETARY Sy Ableman just called. Said he got disconnected. \nBATHROOM DOOR A hand enters to knock. Man's Voice Out in a minute! SARAH, the sixteen-year-old girl who has just knocked, rolls her eyes. \nSARAH I gotta wash my hair! I'm going out tonight! \nVOICE Out in a minute! \nSARAH Jesus Christ! She stomps down the hall. \nKITCHEN Judith, a woman of early middle age, is at the stove. SARAH enters. \nSARAH W is Uncle Arthur always in the bathroom? \nJUDITH He has to drain his sebacious cyst. You know that. Will you set the table? \nSARAH Why can't he do it in the basement? Or go out in the garage! \nLARRY I think they'll give me tenure. \nJUDY You think. \nLARRY \n(EQUABLY) Well, I don't know. These things aren't, you know.. . \nJUDY No, I don't know. Which is why I ask. \nLARRY \nWELL- \nSARAH Mom, how long is Uncle Arthur staying with us? \nJUDY Ask your father. \nBACK YARD Twilight. LARRY is stepping onto a hose as he unwheels it from the drum of a traveling sprinkler, laying out an are to cover the back yard. Intermittent thwacks from next door: Gar Brandt and his son, who also has a buzz cut and a white T-shirt, throw a baseball back and forth. Gar Brandt throws hard. The ball pops in the boy's mitt. \nMITCH Ow. LARRY walks over to the boundary defined by the fresh mowing. He sights down it. Gar Brandt looks over his shoulder at LARRY, looking. Gar Brandt is expressionless. He \ngoes back to throwing. \nMITCH Ow. \nINSIDE Evening. Lights on. LARRY sits at the kitchen table, a briefcase open on the chair next to him. Blue books-examination booklets-are spread on the table in front of him. He reads, occasionally making marginal scribbles, grading. From off, faint and dulled by intervening walls, rock music: somewhere in the house DANNY is listening to the Jefferson Airplane. The clink of teaspoon against china as LARRY stirs his tea. He looks up at a noise: JUDY enters. \nJUDY Honey. \nLARRY \n(ABSENT) Honey. \nJUDY Did you talk to Sy? Still absent, without looking up: \nLARRY Sy?-Sy Ableman!-That's right, he called, but I- \nJUDY You didn't talk to him. \nLARRY No, I- \nJUDY You know the problems you and I have been having. Sympathetic, but still absent: \nLARRY Mm. \nJUDY Well, Sy and I have become very close. This brings LARRY's head up. He focuses on JUDY, puzzled. She elaborates: In.short: I think it's time to start talking about a divorce. LARRY stares at her. A long beat. At length, trying to digest: \nLARRY . Sy Ableman! \nJUDITH LARRY, the children know. Do you think this is some secret? Do you think this is something we're going to keep quiet? SARAH enters. \nSARAH Dad, Uncle Arthur is in the bathroom again! And I=m going to the hole at eight! She hits DANNY on the back of the head. \nDANNY Stop it! \nLARRY SARAH! What's going on! \nDANNY She keeps doing that! \nLATER LARRY sits in a reclining chair in the living room, head back, listening to Sidor Belarsky on the hi-fi. On top of the music is a hissing-sucking sound. There is also the sound of a pencil busily scratching paper. We cut to its source: Uncle Arthur sits scribbling into a spiral notebook, his free hand holding the end of a length of surgical tubing against the back of his neck. The tube leads to a water-pik-like appliance on an end table next to him-the source of the sucking sound. After a long beat of listening to the music, LARRY speaks into space: \nLARRY Arthur? Uncle Arthur does not look up from his scribbling. Uncle Arthur Yes. LARRY continues to stare at the ceiling. \nLARRY What're you doing? Still without looking up: Uncle Arthur Working on the Mentaculus. Long beat. Music. Scribbling. \nLARRY Any luck, um, looking for an apartment? More scribbling. Uncle Arthur No. The doorbell chimes. \nFRONT DOOR LARRY enters, glances through the front door's head-height window, and-freezes, one hand arrested on the way to the doorknob. His point-of-view: framed by the window, yellowly lit by the stoop light, a human head. A middle-aged man, a few years older than LARRY. A fleshy face with droopy hangdog features, a five-o'clock shadow, and sad Harold Bloom eyes. LARRY opens the door. \nLARRY Sy. Sy, entering, thrusts out a hand. His voice vibrates with a warm, sad empathy: \nSY Good to see you, LARRY. He is a heavy-set man wearing a short-sleeved shirt that his belly tents out in front of him. In his left hand he holds a bottle of wine. \nLARRY \n(TIGHTLY) I'll get Judith. \nSY No, actually LARRY, I'm here to see you, if I might. He shakes his head. . Such a thing. Such a thing. \nLARRY Shall we go in the... He is leading him into the kitchen but Sy, oblivious to surroundings, plows on with the conversation, arresting both men in the narrow space between kitchen sink and stove, and invading LARRY's space. \nSY You know, LARRY-how we handle ourselves, in this situation-it's so impawtant. \nLARRY Uh-huh. \nSY Absolutely. Judith told me that she broke the news to you. She said you were very adult. \nLARRY Did she. \nSY Absolutely. The respect she has for you. \nLARRY Yes? \nSY Absolutely. But the children, LARRY. The children. He shakes his head. . The most impawtant. \nLARRY Well, I guess... \nSY Of coss. And Judith says they're handling it so well. A tribute to you. Do you drink wine? Because this is an incredible bottle. This is not Mogen David. This is a wine, LARRY. A bawdeaux. \nThe lights are out. Very quiet. Uncle Arthur lightly snores. LARRY still stares at the ceiling. He shifts his weight. The aluminum frame of the cot squeaks. He shifts again. Another creak. LARRY fishes his watch from the jumble of clothes on the floor: \nKITCHEN LARRY, in his underwear, spoons ground coffee into the percolator. Uncle Arthur snores softly on in the other room. From outside, a dull thunk. LARRY pulls back a curtain. Next door, Gar Brandt is going down the walk, wearing camouflage togs and camo billed cap, a rifle bag slung over his shoulder. He is carrying an ice chest, its contents clicking and sloshing. The boy Mitch, also wearing camo clothes and cap and also with a rifle bag, has just closed the front door. He now lets the screen door swing shut behind him and follows his father down the walk to the car in the driveway. The twitter of early morning birds. Gar's voice, though not projected, stands out in the pre-dawn quiet: \nGAR Let's see some hustle, Mitch. \nCLOSE ON THE NOTEBOOK Its top sheet, densely covered by equations, has a heading: The Mentaculus Compiled by Arthur Gopnik After a beat LARRY's hand enters to turn the page. The second page is also densely covered with equations. \nVOICE \nLARRY? This brings LARRY's look up from the Mentaculus. We are in LARRY's office. Standing in the office doorway is Arlen Finkle. \nLARRY Hi Arlen. Arlen Finkle LARRY, I feel that, as head of the tenure committee I should tell you this, though it should be no cause for concern. You should not be at all worried. LARRY waits for more. Arlen seems to need a prompt. \nLARRY Okay. Arlen Finkle I feel I should mention it even though we won't give this any weight at all in considering whether to grant you tenure, so, I repeat no cause for concern. \nLARRY Okay, Arlen. Give what any weight? Arlen Finkle We have received some letters, uh... denigrating you, and, well, urging that we not grant you tenure. \nLARRY From who? Arlen Finkle They're anonymous. And so of course we dismiss them completely. \nLARRY Well... well... what do they say? Arlen Finkle They make allegations, not even allegations, assertions, but \nI'm not really... while we give them no credence, LARRY, I'm not supposed to deal in any specifics about the committee's deliberations. \nLARRY But... I think you're saying, these won't play any part in your deliberations. Arlen Finkle None at all. \nLARRY Um, so what are they... Arlen Finkle Moral turpitude. You could say. \nLARRY Uh-huh. Can I ask, are they, are they-idiomatic? Arlen Finkle I, uh... \nLARRY The reason I ask, I have a Korean student, South Korean, disgruntled South Korean, and I meant to talk to you about this, actually, he- Arlen Finkle No. No, the letters are competently-even eloquently written. A native English-speaker. No question about that. \nLARRY Uh-huh. Arlen Finkle But I reiterate this, LARRY: no cause for concern. I only speak because I would have felt odd concealing it. \nLARRY Yes, okay, thank you Arlen. \nArlen Finkle Best to Judith. LARRY answers with a wan smile. He looks down at the Mentaculus. \nHEBREW SCHOOL EXTERIOR Day. Somewhere inside the school a bell rings. Its doors swing open and children emerge. Our angle is down a line of school busses, each with the the same stenciled Hebrew lettering, waiting to ferry the children home. We are tracking toward the busses to steepen the rake. As children sort themselves out and climb into their respective vehicles, the track brings the nearest bus into the fore- ground. It noisily idles with its signature squeaks and stress sounds, its low coughing engine ominously rumbling. Children start climbing on. \nMINUTES LATER Inside the bus, now moving. Engine noise bangs in louder and air roars in through open windows. We are on the driver, a sallow man in a short-sleeved white shirt with earlocks and a yarmulke. He pitches about, stoically wrestling with the wheel and gear shift as the vehicle bucks. The pitching children. Somewhere, Jefferson Airplane plays. \nDANNY I gotta get my radio back. Ronnie Nudell Maybe the fucker lodged it up his fucking asshole. \nDANNY I gotta get it back. Or Mike Fagle's gonna pound the crap out of me. Ronnie Nudell \nWay up his asshole. \nDANNY And I'll still have to get my sister the money back or she's gonna break four of my records. Twenty bucks, four records. Howard Altar How do you buy all those records. Where do you get your funds. \nIN THE HOUSE As LARRY enters. Judith (ofj) \nLARRY? \nLARRY \n(PROJECTING) Yeah? Judith (ofj) Did you go to Sieglestein Schlutz? No, I-not yet. \nLARRY. Appointment Monday. The thud of a car door outside. SARAH heads for the front door, pulling on a jacket. LARRY is surprised. . Where are you going? \nSARAH I'm going to the hole. \nLARRY At five o'clock? He looks out the front-door window. Four girls of SARAH's age are coming up the walk \nfrom the car. All have dark hair and big noses. \nSARAH We're stopping at Laurie Kipperstein's house so I can wash my hair. LARRY pulls open the door just as the doorbell rings. From the four dark girls: \nVOICES Hi, Mr. Gopnik. \nLARRY You can't wash it here? From somewhere in the house, Jefferson Airplane starts. As she brushes past LARRY: \nSARAH Uncle Arthur's in the bathroom. \nVOICE Out in a minute! Judith enters. \nJUDITH Are you ready? \nLARRY Huh? \nJUDITH We're meeting Sy at Embers. \nLARRY I am? \nJUDITH Both of us. I told you. \nEMBERS \nLARRY has his arms pinned at his sides by hugging Sy Ableman. \nSY LARRY. How are you. \nLARRY Sy. \nSY Hello Judith. \nJUDITH Hello Sy. Once Sy releases LARRY, all seat themselves at Sy's booth, Judith next to Sy, LARRY facing. \nSY Thank you for coming, LARRY. It's so impawtant that we be able to discuss these things. \nLARRY Move out! Where would I go?! \nSY Well, for instance, the Jolly Roger is quite livable. Not expensive, and the rooms are eminently livable. \nJUDITH This would allow you to visit the kids. \nSY There's convenience in its fava. There's a pool- \nLARRY \nWouldn't it make more sense for you to move in with Sy? Judith and Sy gape at him, shocked. After a long beat: \nJUDITH \nLARRY! \nSY LARRY, you're jesting! \nJUDITH LARRY, there is much to accomplish before that can happen. Sy is sadly shaking his head. \nSY LARRY, LARRY, LARRY. I think, really, the Jolly Roger is the appropriate coss of action. He shrugs. It has a pool. \nIN BLACK AND WHITE: A BRAIN It sits in a large fishbowl filled with clear fluid. The brain, alive, pulses. Leads connect it to various pieces of gear outside the fishbowl. Brain and appurtenances sit on a dais of sorts dressed out with bunting. Oddly, the picture is scored with cantorial singing. The brain seems to be giving orders to people who wear imperfectly form-fitting 1950's uniforms of the future. After receiving their instructions the minions of the brain kowtow before it and leave. They are succeeded by two leather-helmeted thugs, big and heavy though lacking muscle definition, who escort a resisting handsome man before the brain. The handsome man, hands tied behind his back, gazes defiantly up at the brain which in some fashion addresses him. We hear blows and voices over the cantorial music: \nDANNY Stop it! \nSARAH Creep fucker! \nDANNY Stop it! I'm getting it! I'm gonna get it! Wider shows that the brain is on television, which DANNY has muted while he plays the Cantor Youssele Rosenblatt record and drills his torah portion. He and SARAH are in a stand-off, hands tensed to either deliver or ward off blows. \nSARAH Brat! LARRY enters. \nLARRY What's going on? \nSARAH \n(LEAVING) Nothing. She closes the door behind her. \nLARRY What was that? \nDANNY Nothing. \nLARRY How's the haftorah coming? Can you maybe use the hi-fi? \nDANNY What? We hear the doorbell off. LARRY indicates the portable record player. \nLARRY \nCan I borrow this? I'm taking some stuff. To, you know, the Jolly Rodger. \nLARRY No. Almost a year and a half since Touche Ross let him go. He's very good with numbers. I think his, his social skills have held him back. \nMIMI Such a sweet man though. \nLARRY Arthur has a good heart. And he never complains, unlike me. Sometimes I don't give him enough credit. \nMIMI He tried to tell me about this thing he's working on, this, um... \nLARRY The Mentaculus? He says it's a, uh. a probability map. Of the universe. He asked if I could help him publish it. Um, it was a little hard for me to evaluate. \nA beat. \nMIMI Does he go out socially at all? \nLARRY He tries. He's been going to the singles mixers at Hillel House.-Well, I should talk, I'm not doing any better. \nMIMI How is Judith? \nLARRY Fine. She's fine. I'm the odd man out. Mimi smiles. \nMIMI Sometimes these things just aren't meant to be. And it can take a while before you feel what was always there, for better or worse. \nLARRY I never felt it! It was a bolt from the blue! What does that mean! Everything that I thought was one way turns out to be another! \nMIMI Then-it's an opportunity to learn how things really are. LARRY broods. Mimi softens. . I'm sorry-I don't mean to sound glib. It's not always easy, deciphering what God is trying to tell you. \nLARRY I'll say. \nMIMI But it's not something you have to figure out all by your- self. We're Jews, we have that well of tradition to draw on, to help us understand. When we're puzzled we have all the \nstories that have been handed down from people who had the same problems. \nLARRY I guess. \nMIMI Have you talked to Rabbi Nachtner? Silence. Arthur is climbing the hill from the lake, dripping wet. He projects: \nARTHUR Boy! The air out here is magnificent! Mimi, looking at LARRY, responds to his dark silence: \nMIMI Why not see him? Mel Nudell has finished spreading and lighting the coals. He now comes and sits next to Mimi, draping an arm over her shoulder. She strokes his hand, still looking at LARRY. \nLARRY What's the rabbi gonna tell me? \nMIMI If I knew I'd be the rabbi. He looks at her glumly. She laughs. . Life is beautiful, LARRY. Nobody's sick. Nobody died. You just need help remembering how to enjoy it. She rests her head against Mel's shoulder. . Where are the kids? \nMEL Woods. Exploring. Uncle Arthur approaches, swim trunks plastered to his thighs, hair dripping, one hand \npressing his towel to the back of his neck. \nARTHUR If somebody could bottle this air they'd make a million bucks! A white title comes up: The First Rabbi \nJUDITH What's going on? The siblings slurp soup, neither answering. After a couple slurps: . Isn't Dad eating? \nJUDITH He's at the Jolly Roger. \nDANNY Oh yeah. More eating. \nFADE OUT \nSIEGLESTEIN, SCHLUTZ In a small windowless conference room lined by bookshelves filled with law reference books, LARRY rises to greet Don Milgram, entering. \nLARRY Don. \nDON How are you, LARRY, Jesus, I am so sorry to be seeing you under these circumstances. \nLARRY Oh, well... \nDON I always thought you and JUDY were rock solid. This is so terrible, LARRY. This is devastating. \nLARRY Well, the way I look at it, it's an opportunity for me to really sit down and figure things out, and, and, look at the world afresh instead of just, you know, settling for the routine, tired old way of looking at things. Don Milgram stares at him. \nDON . Really? \nLARRY \n(DEFLATING) I don't know. Maybe not. \nDON Well, legally, I have to warn you, it's never easy for the husband. Unless, of course, there's some question of the wife having violated the marriage contract. \nLARRY Oh no, nothing like that. She's planning to marry Sy Ableman, but they- \nDON Sy Ableman! \nLARRY Yes, but they- \nDON Esther is barely cold! \nLARRY She passed three years ago. \nDON Well, okay, still-this changes the complexion, LARRY! Sy Ableman! \nLARRY Not in the sense that... there hasn't been hanky-panky. To my knowledge. \nDON Oh. \nLARRY No. I'm fairly certain this is not an issue. And in fact they, uh, Judith wants a Gett. Beat. Don stares blankly at LARRY. LARRY clears his throat. A ritual divorce. \nDON Oh. \nLARRY So that they can remarry in the faith- \nLARRY \n(BLANK) Dick Dutton. \nLARRY'S OFFICE He sits in and picks up the phone. \nLARRY Hello? \nVOICE Hello, Mr. Gopnik, this is Dick Dutton from the Columbia Record Club. I'm calling because it is now, what, four months and we have yet to receive your first payment. \nLARRY I-there's some mistake. I'm not a member of the Columbian Record Club. \nVOICE Sir, you are Lawrence Gopnik of 1425 Flag Avenue South? \nLARRY No, I live at the Jolly Roger. \nVOICE Excuse me? \nLARRY No, I-well, yes, okay. \nVOICE Yes you are Lawrence Gopnik? \nLARRY Okay. \nVOICE Okay means... \nLARRY Okay, yes, Lawrence Gopnik, yes. \nVOICE Okay, well, you received your twelve introductory albums and you have been receiving the monthly main selection for four months now- \nLARRY \"The monthly main selection?\" Is that a record? I didn't \nask for any records. \nVOICE To receive the monthly main selection you do nothing. \nYOU- \nLARRY That's right! I haven't done anything! \nVOICE Yes, that's why you receive the monthly main selection. The last \nLARRY But I- \nVOICE The last one was Santana Abraxis. You- \nLARRY I didn't ask for Santana Abraxis! \nVOICE You request the main selection at the retail price by doing nothing. It is automatically mailed to you. Plus shipping and handling. You're about to- \nLARRY Yes? She enters. \nSARAH Does this mean I can't go to the hole tonight? \nLARRY Does what mean-what happened? \nSARAH Sy Ableman died in a car crash. DANNY's Voice \nHey Dad! \nLARRY What?! DANNY enters. \nDANNY So are you coming back home? Can you fix the aerial? The weeping, off, grows louder and more hysterical. \nLARRY What?! \nDANNY It's still, you know... Loud wailing. \nBLACK After a beat in black, a white title: The Second Rabbi The title fades. \nRABBI'S OFFICE We are close on LARRY. He sits hunched forward, hands clasped in front of him, staring at the floor, sadly shaking his head. After a long beat: \nLARRY It seems like she's asking an awful lot. But then-I don't know. Somebody has to pay for Sy's funeral. Rabbi Nachtner, sitting opposite, nods. Rabbi Nachtner \nUh-huh. \nLARRY His own estate is in probate. But why does it have to be me? Or is it wrong to complain? JUDY says it is. But I'm so strapped for cash right now-paying for the Jolly Roger, and I wrecked the car, and DANNY's bar mitzvah... I... Rabbi Nachtner Something like this-there's never a good time. \nLARRY I don't know where it all leaves me. Sy's death. Obviously it's not going to go back like it was. Rabbi Nachtner Mm. Would you even want that, LARRY? \nLARRY No, I-well yeah! Sometimes! Or-I don't know; I guess the honest answer is I don't know. What was my life before? Not what I thought it was. What does it all mean? What is Hashem trying to tell me, making me pay for Sy Ableman's funeral? Rabbi Nachtner Mm. \nLARRY And-did I tell you I had a car accident the same time Sy had his? The same instant, for all I know. Is Hashem telling me that Sy Ableman is me, or we are all one or something? Rabbi Nachtner How does God speak to us: it's a good question. You know Lee Sussman? \nLARRY DOCTOR Sussman? I think I-yeah. Rabbi Nachtner Did he ever tell you about the goy's teeth? \nLARRY No... I-What goy? Rabbi Nachtner So Lee is at work one day; you know he has the orthodontic practice there at Texa-Tonka. \nLARRY Uh-huh. Rabbi Nachtner Right next to the Gold Eagle Cleaners. We cut to: \nSIGN FOR THE GOLD EAGLE CLEANERS It dominates a small suburban strip mall. Rabbi Nachtner continues in voice-over as we cut to a smoked glass door that identifies Leon Sussman, DDS. Rabbi Nachtner He's making a plaster mold-it's for corrective bridge work-in the mouth of one of his patients... A close shot of a man's mouth biting down on two horse-shoe shaped troughs-an upper and a lower-that overflow an oozing white goo. . Russell Kraus. He's a delivery dispatcher for the Star and Tribune with chronic mandicular deterioration. The grinding guitar solo from Jefferson Airplane's \"Bear Melt\" scores the narrative. The patient opens his mouth as a hand enters to grab the upper tray. The reverse shows Dr. Sussman, a balding middle-aged man, dressed in the the high- collared white smock of an oral surgeon. He carries the mold over to a drying table. Kraus is twisted over the side of the chair spitting into the water-swirled spit-sink. . Well, the mold dries and Lee is examining it one day \nbefore fabricating an appliance... Another day: Dr. Sussman is sitting at his desk examining the lower mold. He notices something unusual. . He notices something unusual. Sussman reaches up for the loupe attached to his eyeglasses. There seems to be something engraved on the inside of the patient's lower incisors... He flips down the loupe. His eyes are hugely magnified as he stares. Sure enough, it's writing. Sussman squints. His point-of-view: Tiny incised Hebrew letters: sml\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdnn \nBACK TO RABBI NACHTNER He confirms with a nod. Rabbi Nachtner This in a goy's mouth, LARRY. \nBACK TO LEON SUSSMAN The Rabbi's narrative continues. Rabbi Nachtner Tet resh nun lamed nun shin tsayin. What is that-tiranu linoshets? \"Help me\"? Is that what it says? Or is it a name? It's not Kraus's name. Sussman flips the loupe away and looks off, haunted. He rises. He checks the mold, just to be sure. Oh, it's there all \nright... A dental mirror is dipped into the horse-shoe-shaped hardened paste of the mold. It pans tiny letters that stand out in relief, right-side around in the mirror: yw .rin Sussman leans back, thinking. He calls the goy back on the pretense of needing additional measurements for the appliance... Close on Kraus grinning as he shakes Sussman's hand in the reception area. Sussman gestures to invite Kraus back to the examination room. Sussman chats, affecting nonchalance. In the examination room, leaning over Kraus in the chair, the dentist is indeed chatting with seeming casualness. Notice any other problems with your teeth? Anything peculiar, et cetera? Sussman takes a dental mirror. No. No. No. Visited any other dentist recently? He looks in Kraus' mouth with the mirror: Ym nn Sussman frowns. There it is. \"Help me\"? He leans back. Sussman goes home. Can Sussman eat? No. Sussman sits at the kitchen table, untouched food in front of him. His wife chats volubly while Sussman stares into space. Can Sussman sleep? No. \nTHEN: . We speak of L'olam ha-ba, the World to Come. Not heaven. Not what the gentiles think of as afterlife. \"L'olam ha-ba.\" What is L'olam ha-ba? Where is L'olam ha-ba? Well: it is not a geoaraphic place, certainly. Like-Canada. Murmured chuckles from the congregation. Nor is it the eretz zavat chalav ood'vash-the land flowing with milk and honey, for we are not promised a personal reward, a gold star, a first-class VIP lounge where we get milk and cookies to eternity! More chuckles. L'olam ha-ba... is in the bosom of Abraham. L'olam ba- ba is in the soul of this community which nurtured Sy Ableman and to which Sy Ableman now returns. That's right, he returns. Because he still inspires us Ableman returns. Because his memory instructs us Ableman returns. Because his thoughts illuminate our days and ways Sy Ableman returns. The frivolous man may vanish without a ripple but Sy Ableman? Sy Ableman was a serious man... \nA sob echoes through the sanctuary. LARRY looks at Judith, who stifles further sobs with a handkerchief. . As you know, the mourner's kaddish does not mention the dead. It praises Hashem; it praises what abides. And Sy Ableman, whose spirit will continue to assist us in tikkun olam, is with us even now, a serious man who would say as we now say Yiskadal v'yiskadash sh'may rabah... The congregation begins to chant along but it and Judith's weeping are cut off by: \nA HAND RAPPING AT A DOOR The front door to the Gopnik home. LARRY, still in his suit from shul and wearing a yarmulka, opens the door. He recoils in surprise edged with fear. Reverse: two uniformed policemen. \nCOP 1 Arthur Gopnik? LARRY is momentarily dumb. Inside the house we can see a corner of a card table set up in the living room with food laid out on it. SARAH sits with her back to us, head wrapped by a towel-turban. Arthur, on the far side of the table, his balding head domed by a yarmul- ka, half-leans out so that he may sneak looks toward the men at the door without totally revealing himself. From somewhere down the hall come Judith's muffled sobs. . Are you Arthur Gopnik? \nLARRY I'm... Laurence Gopnik. Cop I Do you go by the name Arthur Gopnik? \nLARRY No. \nCOP 1 Is that Arthur Gopnik? Arthur ducks away. From inside the living room: DANNY (off) Dad? What's going on? \nLARRY Can you tell me what's going on. We're sitting shiva here. \nCOP 1 You're what. \nLARRY A religious observance. We're... bereaved. The cop standing behind gazes in over his partner's shoulder. \nCOP 2 Who died? \nLARRY My wife's um... it's a long story. \nCOP 1 Look. Tell Gopnik-you know, Arthur Gopnik-he's breaking the law. We're not arresting him now but next time we will. Gambling is against the law in this state. That's just the way it is. All right. Go back to your... \nCOP 2 Sorry, sir. \nLIVING ROOM A minute later. The family-except for Judith, whose weeping continues off-sits around the card table. A long beat. At length: \nDANNY Dad, we get Channel 4 now but not Channel 7. \nLARRY Arthur, how could you do that to this family. On Sy's... on Sy's- \nARTHUR It's a victimless crime. \nLARRY That doesn't make it right! And you- \nDANNY He won a lot of money, Dad! The Mentaculus really works! LARRY's gaze swings onto his son. \nLARRY You knew about it?! \nDANNY Well, um... \nARTHUR They must have finked me out. They knew I could just keep on winning, so a couple weeks ago they blackballed me, and now they've- \nLARRY What did you do with the money you won? Silence. Arthur sneaks a look at DANNY. LARRY looks back and forth between them. . What's going on? Arthur shrugs. \nARTHUR \nLARRY It's hard. I think she emptied our bank account. I tried to ask her about it, very civilly. \nDON Mm. \nLARRY She, uh... \nDON Yeah, yeah you better open an account in your name only, put your paychecks in there from here on out. Til we know where we stand. \nLARRY Can I? \nDON Oh, absolutely! \nLARRY That's not, um, dishonest? \nDON Oh, absolutely! You, uh- \nLARRY I hate to say this, but I think she's also been sneaking cash out of my wallet. \nDON Ouch. Well, yes, this is definitely, um, adversarial. The \nfirst thing we-are you all right? LARRY is wincing as he rubs a forearm under his shirtsleeve. \nLARRY Just a sunburn. I've been spending a lot of time on the roof. For... perspective. He trails off and his head drops back down onto his arms. Don gives him an appraising look. \nDON . Have you seen the Rabbi? \nLARRY (muffled again) Talked to Nachtner. \nDON You should talk to Minda. \nLARRY They told me Minda doesn't do pastoral work any more. Just.. . ceremonial. \nDON Mm. Congratulates the bar mitzvah boy every week, so forth? LARRY nods miserably. . That's too bad. A very wise man, Minda. LARRY raises his head. \nLARRY Getting old. \nDON Very old. \nLARRY No, me. \nDON LARRY, you're fine. It's a bump in the road. Was Nachtner helpful at all? LARRY gives a helpless shrug. Don rolls his eyes. . What-did he tell you about the goy's teeth? A knock on the door. Don projects: Yeah? The door cracks open. A pipe edges in, followed by a peeking face: Solomon Schlutz. . Oh, good! Sol, come on in. Solomon Schlutz is a large man in shirtsleeves and suspenders. He has the smooth impassive face of a sphynx with a pipe clenched in its teeth. He glides into the room, a sheaf of files tucked under one arm. . Sol has been looking into the property-line issues.. . Solomon Schlutz seats himself at the conference table and starts sorting and arranging the files into three piles. . It seems that you do have a real problem with the original survey. But Sol seems to think there's some kind of nifty way for us to-well, I haven't heard it myself, I'll let Sol map it out. Solomon Schlutz continues to arrange the files, his eye occasionally lingering on a specific page. When at length he is finished he carefully justifies the edges of the closest pile, takes the pipe out of his mouth, gives LARRY a smile that seems to take some effort, and then taps the pipe in a large glass ashtray. He looks up again at LARRY, this time shocked. His stunned look on LARRY holds for a long beat. LARRY returns a bewildered look. \nSolomon Schlutz, staring at LARRY as if he were some sort of monster, emits one barking \nSYLLABLE: Solomon Schlutz Gah! His stare holds. He reddens. \nDON .Sol? Solomon Schlutz's face now passes from the red end of the spectrum to the purple. Solomon Schlutz Nnnnff! The pipe clatters out of his hand. The hand grabs at his own shirt front. . Glufffl... Now his head pitches back. His backflung weight and twisting body send his chair tipping over, one hand still clutching at his chest while the other frantically waves. He disappears behind the conference table and lands with a floor-shaking thump. His writhing and gurgling remain audible. \nDON Sol! Sol! Don Milgram has risen to look down at his fallen colleague; now he flings open the conference room door and bellows into the office: An ambulance! Quick! Somebody call an ambulance! A \nLARRY Sure. \nCLASSROOM We are close over LARRY's shoulder as he scribbles symbols onto the chalkboard. \nLARRY . and that means... so that... from which we derive... His glances back toward the class show that he is wearier, baggier-eyed, more haggard than ever. There is also something odd about his posture. He writes smaller and smaller so as to finish before hitting the right edge of the chalkboard. . and also.. which lets us... and... Wider as he finishes and straightens up, revealing that he has been stooping to write across the very bottom of the board. The equation covers every inch of the classroom-wide three-paneled chalkboard. LARRY is an off balance figure at the right edge of frame. Reverse on the class: staring. Okay? LARRY claps chalk dust from his hands. . The Uncertainty Principle. It proves we can't ever really know... what's going on. A bell sounds. The students start to shake off their stupor and rise. LARRY projects over the wallah: . So it shouldn't bother you. Not being able to figure anything out. Although you will be responsible for this on the mid-term. The thinning crowd gradually reveals one person still seated: Sy Ableman. He wears a prayer shawl and yarmulka. \nLARRY does not seem surprised to see him. . Did you follow that? Sy Ableman Of coss. Except that I know what's going on. How do you explain. \nLARRY Well, it might be that, in, you know, in L'olam ha-bah- Sy Ableman Excuse me. Not the issue. In this world, LARRY. He nods at the chalkboard. . I'll concede that it's subtle. It's clevva. But at the end of the day, is it convincing? \nLARRY Well-yes it's convincing. It's a proof. It's mathematics. Sy Ableman Excuse me, LARRY. Mathematics. Is the art of the possible. LARRY's brow furrows. \nLARRY I don't think so. The art of the possible, that's... I can't remember... something else... Sy Ableman I'm a serious man, LARRY. \nLARRY I know that. So if I've got it wrong, what do I- Sy Ableman holds up one hand to silence him. Sy Ableman So simple, LARRY. See Minda. \nLARRY I know, I want to see Minda! I want to see Minda! They told me that oonh! Without our having seen him rise or cross the room Sy Ableman has body-slammed LARRY into the chalkboard. Now he grabs LARRY by the hair and whips his head against the equation. As he slams LARRY's head, again and again, the chalkboard chatters and the fringes on Sy's tallis dance. Sy Ableman See Minda! See Minda! I fucked your wife, LARRY! I seriously fucked her! That's what's going on! See Minda! \nLARRY Very close on his eyes as they open. His head is on a pillow. Dull early light. A hissing sound. LARRY looks blearily over. On the vanity table just outside the motel bathroom door sits Uncle Arthur's cyst evacuator. Its waggling hose snakes into the cracked bathroom door as the machine hisses. \nMEZUZA On a doorpost. A hand enters to knock. A long beat. The person knocking gives up and his footsteps start to go away just as the door opens to reveal an attractive woman the sunbathing neighbor, now wearing plaid shorts and a buttoned white blouse. Her point-of-view: LARRY, frozen halfway down the stoop, head turned back up toward the door. \nWOMAN Mr. Gopnik. \nLARRY Oh. Hello, Mrs. Samsky. I knocked, and then thought you weren't here. I, uh... Mrs. Samsky's voice is soft and breathy: Mrs. Samsky It just took me a second to get to the door. I was out back. LARRY stands nodding. He seems to need prompting. Mrs. Samsky does: . Can I help you? Wanna come in? \nLARRY No, I- One hand on the door, she steps back. Mrs. Samsky It's cooler. \nLARRY Oh. Okay. I just wanted to let you know... He is entering. \nINSIDE After the outside glare the house does indeed seem cooler. LARRY looks around the living room, dim but neat. Wavering light sifts through closed vertical blinds which drift and click over floor-vented air-conditioning. Mrs. Samsky closes the door, shutting out all sound from outside. \nLARRY I've noticed that Mr. Samsky isn't around, and I- Mrs. Samsky He travels. \nLARRY Uh-huh. Yeah, I never seem to see him, so I thought I should let you know, since you're somewhat new here, if you ever have, whatever, chores that you'd, um, or just help with something-I've decided to help others-you know, in a neighborly way... She gazes at him with the least hint of a smile and waits for the speech to dribble away to silence. In the ensuing beat, quiet except for the clicking of the blinds, she is perfectly still. Finally, only her mouth moves: Mrs. Samsky How thoughtful. LARRY shrugs off the compliment. \nLARRY Oh it's nothing. It's just good to know your neighbors. And to help. Help others. Although I don't care much for my neighbors on the other side, I must say. Mrs. Samsky lets another smiling silence pass before responding. Mrs. Samsky . Goys, aren't they? \nLARRY Mm. Very much so. Maybe it's not fair to judge; I have to admit I- Mrs. Samsky Won't you sit down? \nLARRY Oh! Um. Okay. Thank you. Mrs. Samsky Iced tea? I have some. She is already turning to the kitchen. \nLARRY Okay.. . He watches her and reacts to: The backs of her thighs. The flesh retains the broad cross-hatch of her lawn chair. She disappears into the kitchen, but calls out: Mrs. Samsky I don't see you around much, either. \nLARRY Yes. Actually I haven't been home a lot recently, I, uh, my wife and I are, uh, well, she's got me staying at the Jolly Roger, the little motel there on- Mrs. Samsky is reentering with two tall glasses of iced tea beaded with moisture. The click of the ice cubes joins the clicking of the blinds. Mrs. Samsky You're in the doghouse, huh? She hands him a glass as she sits on the couch next to him, not invasively close, one bare leg folded onto the couch, the other draped over it. \nLARRY Yeah, that's an understatement I guess, I -thank you-I, \nUH- Mrs. Samsky Do you take advantage of the new freedoms? LARRY stares at her. Mrs. Samsky gazes back. Her look displays equanimity; his, not. \nARTHUR \nAAAHHHH! Shockingy loud, the scream is hard to interpret. Arthur flings off his bedclothes. He leaps from the bed and runs to the door. In boxer shorts and undershirt he flings the door open and runs out of the room. \nLARRY Arthur! LARRY leaps from his bed, also in his underwear. He goes to the door but pauses, peering cautiously outside. Satisfied that the courtyard is deserted, he plunges into it. \nCOURTYARD The courtyard/parking lot is hardlit by ghastly mercury vapor lights. The pool, surrounded by chain-link fence, has been drained. Its white concrete interior is cracked \nand weedy. Uncle Arthur is hunched weeping in a corner of the pool enclosure. \nLARRY \n(HISSING) Arthur! He opens the creaking gate and scurries over to Arthur. . You've got to pull yourself together! Arthur is suddenly angry. His voice bounces off the concrete: \nARTHUR It's all shit, LARRY! It's all shit! \nLARRY Arthur. Don't use that word. \nARTHUR It's all fucking shit! \nLARRY Arthur! Come on! \nARTHUR Look at everything Hashem has given you! And what do I get! I get fucking shit! \nLARRY Arthur. What do I have. I live at the Jolly Roger. \nARTHUR You've got a family. You've got a job. Hashem hasn't given me bupkes. \nLARRY It's not fair to blame Hashem, Arthur. Please. Sometimes -please calm down-sometimes you have to help your- self. \nARTHUR \nDon't blame me! You fucker! \nLARRY Arthur. Please. \nARTHUR Hashem hasn't given me shit. Now I can't even play cards. He starts weeping again. LARRY looks around. \nLARRY Arthur. This isn't the right forum. Please. Not by the pool. Arthur weeps. Arthur... It's okay... It's okay... \nMORNING LARRY and Arthur are driving. We are looking at the two of them square through a windshield in which towering conifers stream by in reflection. It seems to be a glorious day. \nLARRY Is this it? Both men peer out. \nARTHUR I think so... yeah... there... He indicates the road ahead. \nA SIGNPOST The old-fashioned kind with wooden fingers pointing the different directions. One points toward CANADA. \nWe tip off the sign as LARRY's car passes and recedes. There is a canoe strapped to its roof. \nVOICE Nefesh echad sheichayim, yitzeh gamor shel effashot... DANNY is still staring at the end of the yad against the parchment scroll. Someone's hand enters and moves the yad to a different place in the text. The voice repeats: . Nefesh echad sheichayim, yitzeh gamor shel effashot... DANNY looks up from the scrolls. In the congregation Ronnie Nudell sits hunched-shouldered and squished between his parents. He returns DANNY's red-rimmed slack-jawed stare. The insistent voice: . Nefesh echad shelchayim, yitzeh gamor shel effashot... DANNY looks over. From the surrounding scrum the prompter nods at him. He looks somewhat like Cantor Youssele Rosenblatt. \n. Nefesh echad shelchayim, yitzeh gamor shel effashot.. . DANNY looks back down at the scroll. A hand enters to tap a pointing finger where the yad points. . Nefesh echad shelchayim, yitzeh gamor shel effa- DANNY suddenly erupts: \nDANNY Nefesh echad shelchayim, yitzeh gamor shel effashot. . \nPROMPTER Mm-hm. DANNY continues to boom out the torah portion. He moves the yad along the line of letters. In the congregation, LARRY and Judith watch. We hear DANNY chanting fluently and LARRY squeezes the hand Judith has laced through his arm. Juith whispers: \nJUDITH I'm sorry that... things have been so hard for us... \nLARRY It's okay. \nJUDITH Sy had so much respect for you, LARRY. He pats her hand. A beat. . He wrote letters to the tenure committee. \nLATER The congregation is loudly singing V'Zos Hatorah. A tallised man of late middle age \nhoists the open scroll from the lectern and raises it high, turning his back on the congregation so that all may see it. DANNY has been ensconced in a highbacked chair upstage on the bema. His point-of-view of the man holding the torah is close and steeply raked. The man is sweating. The heavy scrolls vibrate slightly from his effort to keep them aloft. As the congregation continues to sing he mutters under his breath: \nMAN Jesus Christ.. . \nLATER DANNY stands behind the left lectern facing Rabbi Nachtner who holds a small kiddush cup out to him. Although Rabbi Nachtner seems to be addressing DANNY, he is projecting loudly. \nNACHTNER . taking your place as a member of our tribe. You will go and see Rabbi Minda after the service. You will cele- brate in a reception downstairs in Schanfield Hall. And then you will be a member of B'Nai Abraham and of the Nation of Israel. DANNY Gopnik, the Sisterhood makes a gift to you of this kiddush cup so that you will remember this blessed day on the next shabbas and the next, and on every shabbas of a long and fruitful life, and, until that wonderful day when you stand under the chupa, we say.. . \nCONGREGATION Amen. DANNY, still red-eyed, tries to focus. His point-of-view shows the kiddush cup large in the foreground, extended toward him by the Rabbi beaming above. His own hand rises into frame to grasp the kiddush cup. The congregation starts Adon Olam. \nA DOOR Creaking open. The cut has snapped off the robust Adon Olam, leaving sepulchral quiet. DANNY, clutching his kiddush cup, hesitantly enters the dim study. Minda's elderly eastern European gatekeeper closes the door behind him. Minda is an old man staring at him from behind a bare desktop. His look, eyes magnified by thick glasses, is impossible to read. DANNY creeps to the chair facing the desk. He gingerly sits on the squeaking leather upholstery, self-conscious under Minda's stare. Minda breathes regularly through his mouth. It is the only sound in the room. A long beat. The two sit face to face. Minda smacks his lips a couple of times, preparing to speak. Another beat. \nFINALLY: \nMINDA When the truth is found. To be lies. He pauses. He clears his throat. At length: . And all the hope. Within you dies. Another beat. DANNY waits. Minda stares. He smacks his lips again. . Then what? DANNY doesn't answer. It is unclear whether the question was directed at him. Quiet. \nMinda clears his throat with a loud and thorough hawking. The hawking abates. Minda sniffs. . Grace Slick. Marty Balin. Paul Kanta. Jorma... somethin. These are the membas of the Airplane. He nods a couple of times. . Interesting. He reaches up and slowly opens his desk drawer. He takes something out. He lays it on the bare desk and pushes it partway across. . Here. It is DANNY's radio. . Be a good boy. \nLARRY'S OFFICE LARRY is at his desk sorting through mail. Arlen Finkle (off DANNY was magnificent. LARRY looks up: Arlen is leaning in his accustomed spot in the office doorway. \nLARRY Oh. Thank you, Arlen. Arlen Finkle Mazel tov. It was wonderful. \nLARRY Yes it was. Thank you. Arlen Finkle Such a time of nachas, LARRY. He's your youngest. You have to savor it. \nLARRY I do. I will. Arlen Finkle See you at the staff caf. \nLARRY Yes. Arlen shoves off to go, but hesitates. Arlen Finkle I just... I shouldn't tell you. I'm not telling you officially. The tenure candidates aren't notified til Monday. \nLARRY . Yes? Arlen nods. Arlen Finkle You'll be very pleased. LARRY stares at him. \nLARRY Thank you, Arlen. Over his back as he goes: Arlen Finkle I didn't say anything. Mazel tov. \nHEBREW SCHOOL CORRIDOR Distant thunder at the cut. We are tracking behind Minda's female Caliban as she walks down the hall, stooped and shuffling. She holds a stack of papers in one hand. \n", "test1_input": "REB GROSHKOVER is still chuckling. \nREB GROSHKOVER Oh my. Oh my yes. What nonsense. And even if there were spirits, certainly... He thumps his chest. I am not one of them! \nWIFE Pesel always worried. Your corpse was left unattended for many minutes when Pesel's father broke shiva and left the room-it must have been then that the Evil One- She breaks off to spit at the mention of the Evil One. -took you! \nREB GROSHKOVER is terribly amused: \nREB GROSHKOVER \"My corpse!\" Honestly! What a wife you have! \nWIFE Oh yes? Look, husband... \nShe steps forward to the Reb, who looks enquiringly up at her. They were preparing the body. Pesel's father shaved one check... \nAs his eyes roll down to look at her hand, she draws it across his smooth right cheek. Then he left the room. He came back, and shaved the other... \nShe reaches across to the other cheek, REB GROSHKOVER's eyes following her hand- You were already gone! \n-and drags her hand across. A bristly sound. \nREB GROSHKOVER laughs. \nREB GROSHKOVER I shaved hastily this morning and missed a bit-by you this makes me a dybbuk? \nHe appeals to the husband: It's true, I was sick with typhus when I stayed with Peselle, but I recovered, as you can plainly see, and now I-hugh! \nThe wife steps back. REB GROSHKOVER looks slowly down at his own chest in which the wife has just planted an ice pick. REB GROSHKOVER stares at the ice pick. The wife stares. \nThe husband stares. Suddenly, REB GROSHKOVER bursts out laughing: What a wife you have! The husband can manage only a shocked whisper: \nMAN Woman, what have you done? \nREB GROSHKOVER again looks down at his chest, which again moves him to laughter. He shakes his head. \nREB GROSHKOVER Why would she do such a thing? \nHe looks up. I ask you, Velvel, as a rational man: which of us is possessed? \nWIFE What do you say now about spirits? He is unharmed! \nREB GROSHKOVER On the contrary! I don't feel at all well. \nAnd indeed, blood has begun to soak through his vest. He chuckles with less energy. One does a mitzvah and this is the thanks one gets? \nMAN Dora! Woe, woe! How can such a thing be! \nREB GROSHKOVER Perhaps I will have some soup. I am feeling weak... \nHe rises to his feet but totters. Or perhaps I should go... \n", "test1_true": "FINALLY: \nMAN Dear wife. We are ruined. Tomorrow they will discover the body. All is lost. \nWIFE Nonsense, Velvel... She walks to the door... Blessed is the Lord. Good riddance to evil and shuts it against the wind. \nBLACK A drumbeat thumps in the black. Music blares: the Jefferson Airplane. Grace Slick's voice enters: When the truth is found to be lies And all the hope inside you dies Don't you want somebody to love. . . \nAn image fades in slowly, but even up full it is dim: some kind of round, dull white shape with a small black pinhole center. This white half-globe is a plug set in a flesh-toned field. The flesh tone glows translucently, backlit. We are drifting toward the white plug and, as we do so, the music grows louder still. \nAN EARPIECE \nA pull back-a reverse on the preceding push in-from the cheap white plastic earpiece of a transistor radio. The Jefferson Airplane continues over the cut but becomes extremely compressed. The pull back reveals that the earpiece is lodged in someone's ear and trails a white cord. \nWe drift down the cord to find the radio at its other end. As we do so we hear, live in the room, many voices speaking a foreign language in unison. A classroom, apparently. The radio is on a desktop but hidden from in front by the book held open before it. The book is written in non-Roman characters. We are in Hebrew school. \nThe boy who is listening to the transistor radio-DANNY Gopnik-sits at a hinge-topped desk in a cinderblock classroom whose rows of desks are occupied by other boys and girls of about twelve years of age. It is dusk and the room is flourescent-lit. At the front of the room a gray-haired man in a worn suit and tie addresses the class. DANNY straightens one leg so that he may dig into a pocket. With an eye on the TEACHER to make sure he isn't being watched, he eases something out: A twenty-dollar bill. \nTEACHER Mee yodayah? Reuven? Rifkah? Mah zeh \"anakim\"? Efsheh mashooach ba-avodah? \nA BLINDING LIGHT At the cut to the light the Jefferson Airplane music jumps up full. The light resolves into a multi-flared image of a blinking eye. Reverse: the inside of a human ear. Fleshy whorls finely veined, a cavity receding to dark. Objective on the DOCTOR's office: the DOCTOR is peering through a lightscope into the ear of an early-middle-aged man, LARRY Gopnik. The Jefferson Airplane music continues. \nDOCTOR Uh-huh. \nHEBREW SCHOOL Close on Hebrew characters being scribbled onto the blackboard as the TEACHER talks. The TEACHER, talking. A bored child, staring off. His point-of-view: a blacktopped parking lot with a few orange school busses, beyond it a marshy field, and distant suburban bungalows. Close on another child staring at something through drooping eyelids. His point-of-view: very close on the face of a classroom clock. We hear its electrical hum. Its red sweep-second hand crawls around the dial very, very slowly. DANNY Gopnik hisses: \nDANNY Fagle!.. . The TEACHER drones on, writing on the blackboard. DANNY's eyes flit from the TEACHER to the student sitting kitty-corner in front of him-a husky youth with shaggy hair. He hasn't heard the prompt. . Fagle! The TEACHER turns from the blackboard and DANNY leans back, eyes front, folding the twenty up small behind his book. \nTEACHER Ahnee rotzeh lalechet habait hakisai. Mee yodayah? Misaviv tamid anachnoo tamid... The clock-watching child, eyelids sinking, is beginning to drool out of one side of his mouth. \nDOCTOR'S OFFICE \nThe light again flaring the lens. Reverse: looking into a pupil. Objective: the DOCTOR looking through his scope into LARRY's eye. \nDOCTOR Mm-hmm. \nHEBREW SCHOOL A bored child is excavating a bugger from his nose. The TEACHER turns back to the chalkboard to circle something. \nDANNY Fagle! \nTEACHER Hamrah oomoh- He interrupts himself briefly to make a couple of phlegm-hawking sounds. He resumes: . Hamrah oomoh meshiach oomshel zal? \nDOCTOR'S OFFICE The DOCTOR palpates LARRY's midriff, digging his fingers into the hairy, baggy flesh. DOCTOR's Voice Uh-huh. We'll do some routine X-rays. \nHEBREW SCHOOL A young girl holds a hank of her bangs in front of her face, separating out individual hairs to examine them for split ends. \nTEACHER Ahnoo ahnoo mah? Mah? Talmidim? D'vorah? \n", "test1_id": 2661, "test2_input": "LARRY A what? What are you talking about? She turns to go, shaking her head, peeved: \nJUDY You always act so surprised. As she leaves: I have begged you to see the Rabbi. \nFADE IN LARRY has fallen asleep at the kitchen table, face-down in a pile of blue books. Cold blue light sweeps across him and he looks up. \nA short, balding middle-aged man in flannel pyjamas and an old flannel dressing gown stands in front of the open refrigerator holding an open jar of orange juice. He tips the jar back to drink, his free hand holding a balled-up towel to the back of his neck LARRY stares at him. \nFADE OUT \nBLEGEN HALL LARRY enters the departmental office. His eyes are red-rimmed and dark-bagged. He has beard stubble. The department's secretary wheels her castored chair away from her typing. \nSECRETARY Messages, Professor Gopnik. He takes the two phone messages. \nHIS OFFICE LARRY looks at the messages: WHILE YOU WERE OUT Dick Dutton OF Columbia Record Club \nCALLED. REGARDING: \"2\u00c2\u00b0d attempt. Please call.\" WHILE YOU WERE OUT Sy Ableman \nCALLED. REGARDING \"Let's have a good talk.\" A knock brings his look up. \nLARRY Yes-thanks for coming, CLIVE. CLIVE Park enters the office. \n. Have a seat. LARRY uses a key to open the top left desk drawer. He takes out the envelope. We had, I think, a good talk, the other day, but you left something that- \nCLIVE I didn't leave it. \nLARRY Well--you don't even know what I was going to say. \nCLIVE I didn't leave anything. I'm not missing anything. I know where everything is. LARRY looks at him, trying to formulate a thought. \nLARRY Well... then, CLIVE, where did this come from? He waves the envelope. . This is here, isn't it? CLIVE looks at it gravely. \nCLIVE Yes, sir. That is there. \nLARRY This is not nothing, this is something. \nCLIVE Yes sir. That is something. A beat. . What is it. \nLARRY You know what it is! You know what it is! I believe. And \nyou know I can't keep it, CLIVE. \nCLIVE Of course, sir. \nLARRY I'll have to pass it on to Professor Finkle, along with my suspicions about where it came from. Actions have consequences. \nCLIVE Yes. Often. \nLARRY Always! Actions always have consequences! He pounds the desk for emphasis. In this office, actions have consequences! \n", "test2_true": "LARRY Not just physics. Morally. \nCLIVE Yes. \nLARRY And we both know about your actions. \nCLIVE No sir. I know about my actions. \nLARRY I can interpret, CLIVE. I know what you meant me to understand. \nCLIVE Meer sir my sir. LARRY cocks his head. \nLARRY . Meer sir my sir? \nCLIVE (careful enunciation) Mere... surmise. Sir. He gravely shakes his head. . Very uncertain. \nCLOSE ON A TONE ARM A hand lays it onto a slowly spinning vinyl record. Through scratches and pops, a solo tenor starts a mournful Hebrew chant. Close on the sleeve: Rabbi Youssele Rosenblatt Chants Your Haftorah Portion \nVOLUME 12 Rabbi Youssele wears a caftan and a felt hat and has sad eyes. They peer out from the dark beard that covers most of the rest of his face like owl's eyes peering out of the woods. Wider, on DANNY, in his bedroom, evening. He lifts the tone arm on the portable turntable. He chants the passage. He drops the tone arm at the same place; Rabbi Youssele chants the passage again. DANNY listens, eyes narrowed. He lifts the tone arm and chants the passage again. He replays the passage again; before he can lift the tone arm to echo it his door bursts open. Rabbi Youssele continues to chant. \nSARAH You little brat fucker! You snuck twenty bucks out of my drawer! \nDANNY Studying torah! Asshole! \nSARAH You little brat! I'm telling Dad! \nDANNY Oh yeah? You gonna tell him you've been sneaking it out of his wallet? \nSARAH All right, you know what I'm gonna do? You little brat? If you don't give it back? We hear the thunk of the front door opening. DANNY stands, calling: \nDANNY Dad? \nFOYER LARRY is entering with his briefcase. As he stows it in the foyer closet DANNY's voice continues, off: \nDANNY Dad, you gotta fix the aerial. Judith emerges from the kitchen. \nJUDITH Hello LARRY, have you thought about a lawyer? \nLARRY Honey, please! DANNY emerges from the hall. \nDANNY \nWe're not getting channel four at all. \nLARRY (to Judith) Can we discuss it later? \nDANNY I can't get F Troop. \n", "test2_id": 2662, "test3_input": "ARTHUR Hello, Mrs. Samsky. \nLARRY -a miscarriage- \nCOP Does this man live here? \nDANNY He sleeps on the couch. \nLARRY Look! What did he do! \nARTHUR Nothing! I didn't do anything! \nDANNY It folds out. Dad sleeps on a cot. \nLARRY You can't just- \nCOP Sir, we picked this man up at the North Dakota. LARRY is brought up short. \nLARRY The North Dakota! \nARTHUR But I didn't do anything! \nDANNY Dad, what's the North Dakota? \nCOP Solicitation. Sodomy. Very serious. \nLARRY . The North Dakota! We hold on LARRY's shocked reaction as we hear DANNY, off: \nDANNY What's Sodomy, Dad? \nDON MILGRAM He wears a black armband. He sits thinking, bouncing steepled fingers against his nose. \nFINALLY: \nDON What does Arthur say? \nLARRY He says he didn't do anything. \nDON Uh-huh. \nLARRY He says. . . he just went in for a drink. \nDON Uh-huh. Long beat. . Does Arthur drink? \nLARRY No. \nDON Uls-huh. \nLARRY . He says he was confused. \n", "test3_true": "LARRY Okay. Who's- \nDON Ron Meshbesher. \nLARRY Is he good? \nDON Ron is very good. LARRY's gaze wanders. He becomes wistful. \nLARRY I don't understand. He goes to mixers at the Hillel House. \nDON Mm. A beat. . I would call Ron Meshbesher. \nLARRY Is he expensive? \nDON Ron is not cheap. Don focuses on LARRY. Cheerful change of subject: . DANNY's bar mitzvah is... ? \nLARRY This week. \nDON This shabbas! Great! He nods. . It'll be okay. Try to relax, LARRY. Try to relax. \nMRS. SAMSKY'S BEDROOM LARRY is making strenuous love to Mrs. Samsky. Mrs. Samsky So good... so good... She rolls on top of LARRY to straddle him and, still humping, she lights a mentholated cigarette. LARRY moans. \nLARRY Oh my God, Mrs. Samsky... Beyond her head LARRY can see the low cottage-cheese ceiling of the bedroom. Outside we can hear Gar Brandt mowing the lawn. Suddenly we hear muffled laughter and the front door opening. LARRY panics. He hisses: . Who is it? Footsteps are approaching along the hall. Mrs. Samsky doesn't react; she looks calmly down at LARRY even as the bedroom door opens behind her and CLIVE Park walks in wearing a traffic mask. LARRY is mortified: CLIVE, please! Wait outside! Mrs. Samsky blows smoke into LARRY's eyes. The screen goes black. Close on LARRY as he opens his eyes. A shadow falls across his face. His point-of-view: a wooden plank is just being slid into place over his head. The bang of hammer on nailhead. In the black: \nSy Ableman's Voice Nailing it down is so impawtant. We hear the chanting of Kaddish and the sound of dirt hitting the top of the coffin. It drums a steady rhythm. Grace Slick's voice enters: \"Somebody to Love.\" In a break in the vocals right before the chorus: Mrs. Samsky's Voice It's something we do. For recreation. On the chorus downbeat, a crescent moon pops into the black. Gar Brandt traverses the sky, pushing his lawn mower. A cow flies the opposite way. Stars twinkle. Sy Able- man walks across the sky dressed like a shtetl elder, a bindlestick over one shoulder. LARRY bolts upright in bed. Sudden quiet. Uncle Arthur is snoring in the tatty motel room's other bed. A title burns in: \nMINDA \nLARRY He stands looking down in low shot. Above him is cheap Johnson-Armstrong dropped ceiling. \nLARRY Please. I need help. I've already talked to the other rabbis. Please. Reverse shows an elderly eastern European woman seated behind a desk, looking up at \nLARRY. . I won't take much of his time. I need help. I need Minda. It's not about DANNY's bar mitzvah. My boy DANNY. This coming shabbas. Very joyous event. That's all fine. It's, it's more about myself, I've... I've had quite a bit of tsuris lately. Marital problems. Professional. You name it. This is not a frivolous request. This is a serious- I'm a serious-I'm, uh, I've tried to be a serious man. You \nknow, tried to do right, be a member of the community, raise the, raise the, DANNY, SARAH, they both go to school, Hebrew school, a good breakfast. Well, DANNY goes to Hebrew school, SARAH doesn't have time, she mostly... washes her hair. Apparently there are several steps involved. But you don't have to tell Minda that. Just tell him I need help. Please. I need help. He lapses into silence, staring at the secretary. She stares inscrutably back. After a moment she rises, goes to the door behind her, opens it, shuffles into the dimness of an inner office. LARRY cranes to see past her. Her own body and the dimness interfere with a good view of the figure hunched behind the desk. The man is old and bent. His desktop is empty. Murmured voices in Hebrew. A clock ticks in the outer office. LARRY looks around, waiting. Mysterious Judaica adorns the outer office. The old woman is shuffling back. She closes the door on the motionless rabbi and sits down, heavily, behind her own desk. \nSECRETARY The rabbi is busy. \nLARRY He didn't look busy! As she starts shuffling papers: \nSECRETARY He's thinking. \nNIGHT Sidor Belarsky comes in at the cut. \nWe are booming down on LARRY, asleep in bed. We hear weeping, soft, suppressed. LARRY stirs. He opens his eyes. After a groggy beat he reacts to the weeping. He looks over. \nLARRY Arthur... ? Arthur? Arthur is a dim mound on the next bed. His weeping continues. For no reason LARRY continues to keep his voice to a whisper: . Arthur. What's wrong? No answer. . Arthur. It'll be okay. Arthur. We'll get Ron Meshbesher. It'll be okay- \n", "test3_id": 2663}

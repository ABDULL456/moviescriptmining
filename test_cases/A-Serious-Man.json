{"test1_input": "D'VORAH Ahnee to yodayah. The TEACHER begins to pace the desk aisles, looking back and forth among the students. \nTEACHER Mee yodayah? The bugger-seeker, having succesfully withdrawn a bugger, carefully drapes it over the sharp end of his pencil, to what end we cannot know. DANNY, apprehensively eyeing the TEACHER, slides the twenty into the transistor radio's cover-sleeve. \nX-RAY CONE A huge white rubberized cone, pointed directly at us. We hear a rush of static and the DOCTOR's voice filtered through a talk-back: DOCTOR's Voice Hold still. Wider: LARRY is in his shorts lying on his back on an examining table covered by a sheet of tissue paper. The X-ray cone is pointed at the middle of his body. There is a brief sci-fi-like machine hum. It clicks off. \nHEBREW SCHOOL The clock-watching student's head is making descending bobs toward his chest. \nTEACHER Nefsheh shelach hamilamid-eh?! The TEACHER's circuit of the classroom has taken him around behind DANNY. DANNY's book lies face-down on the desk, covering the radio, but the white cord snakes out from under it up to his ear. The TEACHER yanks at the cord. \nThe cord pops out of its jack and the Jefferson Airplane blares tinnily from beneath the book of torah stories. The TEACHER lifts the book to expose the jangling radio. Outraged, the TEACHER projects above the music: . Mah zeh? ! Mah zeh? ! Some of the students are singing along; a couple beat rhythm on their desks. . Shechet, talmidim! Anachnoo lo cam zeh b'bait sefer! Shechet bivakasha! Three other students join in a chorus: \nSTUDENTS Shechet! Shechet bivakasha! The nodding student's head droops ever lower. Other students join in the chant: \nSHECHET! SHECHET! SHECHET BIVAKASHA! \nThe nodding student's chin finally reaches, and settles on, his chest, and he gives a long snorfling inhale of sleep. \nDOCTOR'S OFFICE LARRY, now fully clothed, is seated across from the DOCTOR. The DOCTOR is looking at his file. He absently taps a cigarette out of a pack and lights up. He nods as he smokes, looking at the file. \nDOCTOR Well, I-sorry. He holds the pack toward LARRY. \nLARRY No thanks. \nDOCTOR Well, you're in good health. How're Judith and the kids? \nLARRY Good. Everyone's good. You know. The DOCTOR takes a long suck. \nDOCTOR Good. Daniel must be-what? About to be bar mitzvah? \nLARRY Two weeks. \nDOCTOR Well, mazel tov. They grow up fast, don't they? \nTINTED PHOTO PORTRAIT The portrait, old, in an ornate gilt frame, is of a middle-aged rabbi with a small neat mustache and round spectacles. He wears a tallis hood-style and a phylactery box is strapped to his forehead. A plaque set into the frame identifies the man as Rabbi Minda. Wider shows that the portrait hangs in the Hebrew school principal's office, a white cinderblock room. It is quiet. The only sound is a deep electrical hum. Just visible behind the principal's desk, upon which is a low stack of books and a name plate identifying the occupant as MAR TURCHIK, is the top of a man's head-an old man, with a few whispy white hairs where his yarmulka is not. DANNY, seated opposite, pushes up from his slouch to better see across the desk. We boom up to show more of the principal. He is short. He wears a white shirt and hoist-up pants that come to just below his armpits. He has thick eyeglasses. He fiddles with the transistor radio, muttering: \nPRINCIPAL Hmm... eh... nu? \nHe experiments with different dials on the radio. DANNY nervously watches. \nDANNY You put the- The old man holds up one hand. \nPRINCIPAL In ivrit. (In Hebrew) \nDANNY Um... The old man looks down at the little earpiece pinched between two fingers. He examines it as a superstitious native might a Coca-Cola bottle. The source of the electrical hum: a wall clock whose red sweep-second hand crawls around the dial very, very slowly. The Reb continues to squint at the earpiece. DANNY sighs. He encourages: \nDANNY Yeah, you- The principal's tone is harder: \nPRINCIPAL In ivrit! This time his cold look holds until he is sure that the admonishment has registered. He looks back down at the earpiece. We hear the door open. The principal ignores it. An old woman walks slowly in with a teacup chattering on a saucer. She has thick eyeglasses. She wears thick flesh-colored support hose. She takes slow, short steps toward the desk. The principal is studying the radio. \n", "test1_true": "CLASSROOM We are behind a man who writes equations on a chalkboard, shoulder at work and hand quickly waggling. Periodically he glances back, giving us a fleeting look at his face: it is \nLARRY Gopnik. \nLARRY You following this?... Okay?.. So... Heh-heh... This part is exciting... Students follow along, bored. LARRY continues to write. . So, okay. So. So if that's that, then we can do this, right? Is that right? Isn't that right? And that's Schrodinger's paradox, right? Is the cat dead or is the cat not dead? Okay? \nBLEGEN HALL LARRY is entering the physics department office. The department's secretary wheels her castored chair away from her typing. \nSECRETARY Messages, Professor Gopnik. He takes the three phone messages. \nLARRY Thank you, Natalie. Oh-CLIVE. Come in. A Korean graduate student who was been waiting on a straightbacked chair rises. \nLARRY'S OFFICE He is flipping through the messages. Absently: \nLARRY So, uh, what can I do for you? The messages: WHILE YOU WERE OUT Dick Dutton OF Columbia Record Club \nCALLED. REGARDING: \"Please call.\" WHILE YOU WERE OUT Sy Ableman \nCALLED. REGARDING \"Let's talk.\" WHILE YOU WERE OUT CLIVE Park \nCALLED. REGARDING: \"Unjust test results.\" He crumples the last one. \nCLIVE Uh, Dr. Gopnik, I believe the results of Physics Mid-Term were unjust. \nLARRY Uh-huh, how so? \nCLIVE I received an unsatisfactory grade. In fact: F, the failing grade. \nLARRY Uh, yes. You failed the mid-term. That's accurate. \nCLIVE Yes, but this is not just. I was unaware to be examined on the mathematics. \nLARRY Well-you can't do physics without mathematics, really, can you. \nCLIVE If I receive failing grade I lose my scholarship, and feel shame. I understand the physics. I understand the dead cat. \nLARRY \n(SURPRISED) You understand the dead cat? \nCLIVE nods gravely. But... you... you can't really understand the physics without understanding the math. The math tells how it really works. That's the real thing; the stories I give you in class are just illustrative; they're like, fables, say, to help give you a picture. An imperfect model. I mean-even I don't understand the dead cat. The math is how it really works. CLIVE shakes his head, dubious. \nCLIVE Very difficult... very difficult... \nLARRY Well, I... I'm sorry, but I... what do you propose? \nCLIVE Passing grade. \n", "test1_id": 2661, "test2_input": "LARRY I think they'll give me tenure. \nJUDY You think. \nLARRY \n(EQUABLY) Well, I don't know.

LARRY is stepping onto a hose as he unwheels it from the drum of a traveling sprinkler, laying out an are to cover the back yard. Intermittent thwacks from next door: Gar Brandt and his son, who also has a buzz cut and a white T-shirt, throw a baseball back and forth. Gar Brandt throws hard. The ball pops in the boy's mitt. \nMITCH Ow. LARRY walks over to the boundary defined by the fresh mowing. He sights down it. Gar Brandt looks over his shoulder at LARRY, looking. Gar Brandt is expressionless. He \ngoes back to throwing. \nMITCH Ow. \nINSIDE Evening. Lights on. LARRY sits at the kitchen table, a briefcase open on the chair next to him. Blue books-examination booklets-are spread on the table in front of him. He reads, occasionally making marginal scribbles, grading. From off, faint and dulled by intervening walls, rock music: somewhere in the house DANNY is listening to the Jefferson Airplane. The clink of teaspoon against china as LARRY stirs his tea. He looks up at a noise: JUDY enters. \nJUDY Honey. \nLARRY \n(ABSENT) Honey. \nJUDY Did you talk to Sy? Still absent, without looking up: \nLARRY Sy?-Sy Ableman!-That's right, he called, but I- \nJUDY You didn't talk to him. \nLARRY No, I- \nJUDY You know the problems you and I have been having. Sympathetic, but still absent: \nLARRY Mm. \nJUDY Well, Sy and I have become very close. This brings LARRY's head up. He focuses on JUDY, puzzled. She elaborates: In.short: I think it's time to start talking about a divorce. LARRY stares at her. A long beat. At length, trying to digest: \nLARRY . Sy Ableman! \n", "test2_true": "LARRY You mentioned Sy! \nJUDY Don't twist my words. We- \nLARRY A divorce-what have I done! I haven't done anything- What have I done! \nJUDY LARRY, don't be a child. You haven't \"done\" anything. I haven't \"done\" anything. \nLARRY Yes! Yes! We haven't done anything! And I-I'm probably about to get tenure! \nJUDY Nevertheless, there have been problems. As you know. \nLARRY \nWELL- \nJUDY And things have changed. And then-Sy Ableman. Sy has come into my life. And now- \nLARRY Come into your-what does that mean?! You, you, you, you barely know him! \nJUDY We've known the Ablemans for fifteen years. \nLARRY Yes, but you you said we hadn't done anything! JUDY suddenly is stony: \nJUDY I haven't done anything. This is not some flashy fling. This is not about woopsy-doopsy. LARRY stares at her. \nLARRY Sy Ableman! From down the hall, a knock on a door. A muffled voice: \nARTHUR Out in a minute! \nJUDY Look, I didn't know any other way of breaking it to you. Except to tell you. And treat you like an adult. Is that so wrong? LARRY does not seem to be listening. His eyes roam the room as he thinks. \nLARRY Where do I sleep? JUDY narrows her eyes. \nJUDY What? \nLARRY Arthur's on the couch! \nJUDY Look. Sy feels that we should- \nLARRY Esther is barely cold! \nJUDY Esther died three years ago. And it was a loveless marriage. Sy wants a Gett. This derails the conversation. LARRY stares, trying to pick up the thread. \nLARRY . A what? \nJUDY A ritual divorce. He says it's very important.

I tried to ask her about it, very civilly. \nDON Mm. \nLARRY She, uh... \nDON Yeah, yeah you better open an account in your name only, put your paychecks in there from here on out. Til we know where we stand. \nLARRY Can I? \nDON Oh, absolutely! \nLARRY That's not, um, dishonest? \nDON Oh, absolutely!

LARRY is wincing as he rubs a forearm under his shirtsleeve. \nLARRY Just a sunburn. I've been spending a lot of time on the roof. For... perspective. He trails off and his head drops back down onto his arms. Don gives him an appraising look. \nDON . Have you seen the Rabbi? \nLARRY (muffled again) Talked to Nachtner. \nDON You should talk to Minda. \nLARRY They told me Minda doesn't do pastoral work any more. Just.. . ceremonial. \nDON Mm.

LARRY raises his head. \nLARRY Getting old. \nDON Very old. \nLARRY No, me. \nDON LARRY, you're fine. It's a bump in the road. Was Nachtner helpful at all? LARRY gives a helpless shrug. Don rolls his eyes. . What-did he tell you about the goy's teeth? A knock on the door. Don projects: Yeah? The door cracks open. A pipe edges in, followed by a peeking face: Solomon Schlutz. . Oh, good! Sol, come on in. Solomon Schlutz is a large man in shirtsleeves and suspenders. He has the smooth impassive face of a sphynx with a pipe clenched in its teeth. He glides into the room, a sheaf of files tucked under one arm. . Sol has been looking into the property-line issues.. . Solomon Schlutz seats himself at the conference table and starts sorting and arranging the files into three piles. . It seems that you do have a real problem with the original survey. But Sol seems to think there's some kind of nifty way for us to-well, I haven't heard it myself, I'll let Sol map it out. Solomon Schlutz continues to arrange the files, his eye occasionally lingering on a specific page. When at length he is finished he carefully justifies the edges of the closest pile, takes the pipe out of his mouth, gives LARRY a smile that seems to take some effort, and then taps the pipe in a large glass ashtray. He looks up again at LARRY, this time shocked. His stunned look on LARRY holds for a long beat. LARRY returns a bewildered look. \nSolomon Schlutz, staring at LARRY as if he were some sort of monster, emits one barking \nSYLLABLE: Solomon Schlutz Gah! His stare holds. He reddens. \nDON .Sol? Solomon Schlutz's face now passes from the red end of the spectrum to the purple. Solomon Schlutz Nnnnff! The pipe clatters out of his hand. The hand grabs at his own shirt front. . Glufffl... Now his head pitches back. His backflung weight and twisting body send his chair tipping over, one hand still clutching at his chest while the other frantically waves. He disappears behind the conference table and lands with a floor-shaking thump. His writhing and gurgling remain audible. \nDON Sol! Sol! Don Milgram has risen to look down at his fallen colleague; now he flings open the conference room door and bellows into the office: An ambulance! Quick! Somebody call an ambulance!

He runs a finger over the wad of bills. \nVOICE \nLARRY? He looks up, startled. Arlen Finkle stands in the doorway. . As you know, the tenure committee meets-are you all right? LARRY sits frozen with the white envelope in his hands. \nLARRY I'm... fine. Arlen Finkle I'm sorry. I know you've hit a rough patch. \nLARRY Thank you. I'm fine.

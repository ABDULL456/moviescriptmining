He says something to Chingachgook who nods. Hawkeye and Uncas are a little apart in an outer grouping of the men. Ongewasgone is a war chief and wears a white plume and is tattooed. As Martin finishes, he steps forward. \nONGEWASGONE John Cameron, thank you for your hospitality ... Twin River Mohawk got no quarrel with Les Francais. Trade furs with Les Francais. Now Les Francais bring Huron onto Mohawk hunting grounds ... \nThese people are English, Scots-Irish and Dutch farmers; some French Huguenot \"mechanics\" (craftsmen). They're in shirt-sleeves and Indian moccasins & leggings. The Mohawks' vast lands and corn agriculture border the settlement. They 've been acculturated for over a hundred years. Some wear European calico hunting shirts. Their heads are shaved to scalping locks and many are tattooed. They've politically and commercially played France & England against each other very adroitly for over a hundred years because of their military power and geographic position. Their relations with working farmers and settlers and their families has been mostly one of co-existence because there's always been more than enough for all. This is a WPA mural of ethnic diversity and plurality of frontier America. The Europeans are former indentured laborers, farmers exiled by economics or religious persecution, frontier hunters and trappers ... working people. \nONGEWASGONE (continues) Now Mohawk will fight Huron and Les Francais. My brothers have asked me to lead them in this war so I speak for the Twin River Council. \nThe importance of this commitment is apparent to the lieutenant. \nLIEUTENANT His Majesty King George II is very grateful for your support. \nIAN How far up the valley? \nLIEUTENANT To Fort William Henry. \nCOLONIAL #1 ... two days from here. \nSome don't like this. \nLIEUTENANT It should be enough to remind you France is the enemy. \nHAWKEYE Your enemy ... \nHeads turn to Hawkeye at the periphery of the crowd. \nLIEUTENANT What did you say? \nHAWKEYE (loud) I said ... France is your enemy. Not ours. \nLIEUTENANT Really? Do you want them to overrun all New York colony? \nHAWKEYE First place, you started it with the French over fur-trapping claims to the head waters of the Ohio. (smiles) Now you're sayin' these people have a fight on their hands ... \nLIEUTENANT (ignoring Hawkeye) Will you men help us stop the French? \nHAWKEYE ... and while they are cooped up in your fort, what if the French send war parties to raid their homes? \nIAN What then, Lieutenant? \nLIEUTENANT For your own homes, for king, for country, that's why you men ought to join this fight! \nHAWKEYE You do what you want with your own scalp. Do not be tellin' us what to do with ours. \nLIEUTENANT (furious; to Hawkeye) You, sir! You call yourself a loyal subject? \nHAWKEYE ... No ... Do not call myself much of a subject at all. \nLight laughter. \nCOLONIAL #2 Nathaniel's right. But if I got to fight, figure I'll try and do it fifty miles north of here instead of my bean field. \nAD LIBS Yes. Yeah. No ... \nCAMERON I am stayin' on my farm.

Help my man outside with the baggage. \nGENERAL JEROME WEBB sees Heyward and nods. Three of Webb's Adjutants are on either side. Three remaining Grenadiers in bearskin-covered mitred caps are at the door. Facing Webb are a half dozen colonial representatives, including Captain Jack Winthrop. Heyward watches Jack ... \nLIEUTENANT They will report or be pressed into service! \nLARGE COLONIAL REP Any of the boys worth havin' can disappear into forest ... time it takes you to blink. Where's that leave ya, then? \nHeyward, preparing to hand over dispatches, is interrupted by the insubordinate tone. Equally wound tightly is the Lieutenant. \nLIEUTENANT They will be found! Arrested ... \nWEBB (cuts in) I cannot imagine his Majesty, in his benevolence, would ever object to his American subjects defending their hearth & home, their women & children, if threatened by the \"scourge\" of attack from savages, aroused to such excess by our enemy, the ever-perfidious French. \nJACK Does that mean they will be granted leave to defend their homes if the settlements are attacked? \nWEBB Of course. \nHeyward's more amazed by what he's just heard from Webb. These Americans, including Jack, are streaming past him on their way out. \nJACK You got yourself a colonial militia, General. \nHEYWARD Major Duncan Heyward reporting, Sir! \nWebb's pouring gin. \nWEBB Duncan. How was your journey? \nThe door closes. Dispatches are passed. They are now alone except for the General's two Adjutants and a shadowy form waiting patiently in a corner. He's MAGUA. In the dim light, he's motionless. Webb slides a glass across to Heyward. \nHEYWARD I didn't experience anything so surprising from Bristol to Albany as what I witnessed here today. \nWEBB And what is that? \nHEYWARD The Crown \"negotiating\" the terms of service? \nWEBB I know. (assuming a co-commiserator) One has to give Americans \"reasons\" and make agreements to get them to do anything at all. Tiring, isn't it? (throws up his hands) But that's the way of it here. \nHEYWARD (tight) I thought British policy is 'Make the World ... England', sir. \nA chill. Majors don't upbraid Generals. \nWEBB You will take command of the 62nd Regiment of Foot. At Fort William Henry under Colonel Munro. I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward. \nHEYWARD Sir! ... Might I enquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort. \nWEBB Yes. You may. (to Magua, after a glance at Heyward) You there. What does Munro call you? (to Heyward) The \"Scotsman\" has sent one of his Indian allies to guide you. \nMAGUA \nrises and slowly walks into the light. He is reserved and over six feet tall. His head is shaved into a mohawk. Rings, beads & feathers pierce his ears. A blanket is worn as a shawl over his left shoulder exposing his right arm and heavy tattooing. A long tomahawk is in the belt of his breechcloth. \nWEBB The Scotsman's daughters are at the Poltroon's house. A company of the 33rd will accompany you and Magua will show you the way. \nHEYWARD By your leave, sir. \nWebb holds Heyward a moment \nWEBB (to Adjutants) Explain to the Major we care little about toying with colonial militia because we have little to fear from the French. They have not the nature for war. Their Latinate voluptuousness combines with their Gallic laziness and the result is: they would rather make love with their faces than fight. \nWebb's Adjutants laugh uproariously at his wit. Heyward's stiff, perfunctory smile. He's been made the butt of the joke. He does not share Webb's derisive view of the French. Webb doesn't like Heyward's manner. We don't like Webb. Then: \nWEBB (continuing) Dismissed. \nHeyward stiffly salutes. Webb casually, perfunctorily salutes the younger man in return. \n", "test1_id": 1512, "test2_input": "EXTERIOR FOREST - WIDE - LATE AFTERNOON \nDeep fog has set in.

She's not kidding. \nANOTHER ANGLE: HEYWARD \nhelps Alice. As he does, he stares at Cora's seperation and now her proximity to Hawkeye, who's walking on ahead, is something Heyward doesn't like.

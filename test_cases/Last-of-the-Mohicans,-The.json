{"train": "THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS \nWritten by \nMichael Mann & Christopher Crowe \nFADE IN \nThe screen is a microcosm of leaf, crystal drops of precipitation, a stone, emerald green moss. It's a landscape in miniature. We HEAR the forest. Some distant birds. Their sound seems to reverberate as if in a cavern. A piece of sunlight refracts within the drops of water, paints a patch of moss yellow. The whisper of wind is joined by another sound that mixes with it. A distant rustling. It gets closer and louder. It's shallow breathing. It gets ominous. We're interlopers on the floor of the forest and something is coming. \nSUDDENLY: A MOCCASINED FOOT rockets through the frame scaring us and ... \nEXTREMELY CLOSE: PART OF AN INDIAN FACE running hard. His head shaved bald except for a scalp-lock. Tattoos. He's twenty-five. He seems tall and muscled. Heavy, even breathing. We'll learn later this man is UNCAS, the last of the Mohicans. \nPROFILE: UNCAS' ARMS \nflash as he runs. One carries a flintlock musket. Sweat on the man's skin. A calico shirt is gathered at the waist with a wampum belt of small white beads over a breechcloth. He wears leggings to protect his legs. A long-handled tomahawk is stuffed in his belt. \nCUT TO ... \nANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST - MASSIVE WAR CLUB - DAY \nin the hand of another running man. He's heavier, older ... CHEST \nA green bear claw is tattooed there. Silver armband. A snake is tattooed over his left eyebrow. Silver rings in his ear. He's forty to forty-five. His head is shaved into a scalp-lock. It says: \"Come and lift this from me. Take it, if you can ...\" That prospect strikes us as extremely unlikely. This man is \nCHINGACHGOOK. \nThe French call him \"Le Gros Serpent,\" the Great Snake, because \"he knows the winding ways of men's nature and he can strike a sudden, deathly blow.\" \nWIDE ANGLE: CHINGACHGOOK \nruns, disturbing no leaves, no branches; making no sound. He's running parallel to Uncas through the cathedral of mature forest. It's heavily canopied. There's very little brush. The girth of the trees is huge. Shafts of light illuminate motes of dust and turn leaves emerald where the sun breaks through. Sometimes there's ferns; rhododendron, sometimes pale grass and outcroppings of rock. These men run the forest streams, over boulders, fallen trees and down into ravines as if they own them. They do. \nCUT TO ... \nANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST - LONG BLACK HAIR - DAY \nrocketing through trees. His torn buckskin shirt is tied at the waist with a wampum belt holding a tomahawk and a large knife. A long rifle in which is carved the name \"Killdeer\" is in his right fist. Indian tattooing on his chest. His name is NATHANIEL POE. He's a few years older than Uncas. The French and \tthe French-speaking tribes know him as La Longue Carabine (Long Rifle). Other frontiersmen in New York colony and the Iroquois and Delaware-speaking tribes know him as Hawkeye. Sweat stains his shirt. He flashes through the tree branches disturbing nothing. Making no sound. \nHAWKEYE'S POV: A PIECE OF TAN \ntwo hundred and fifty yards away, a few square inches buried in the foliage ... \nSUDDENLY HE STOPS \nKilldeer's at his shoulder ... \nHAWKEYE'S THUMB \ncocks the lock holding the piece of flint: click. \nUNCAS \nstops dead, holding out his hand ... no sound. \nCHINGACHGOOK \nslips through young trees and stops, shouldering his smoothbore musket. Is this an ambush? \nHAWKEYE'S POV: RACK FOCUS THROUGH THE GUN SIGHT \nFive feet and fourteen pounds of rifle is elevated a half inch and shifted left, off target. It's a precise, smooth movement. No human quiver. \nKILLDEER'S TRIGGER \ntighter ... \nTHE COCK \nholding the flint hits the iron file of the frizzen, shooting sparks into the pan of priming powder which flashes and ... \nTAN is a huge elk that leaps at the sound. \nKILLDEER'S MUZZLE \nCRACKS like lightning. \nAN ELK \nleaps where the .59 caliber round was programmed to intercept him. On the moment of impact ... \nWIDE \nthree men approach the fallen elk and each other. We realize they're hunting together. Hawkeye steps aside for Chingachgook. His massive war club is flat and angles to one side with a stabbing blade. Hawkeye is stepson and stepbrother. The two younger men treat Chingachgook with an easy deference and affection. Hawkeye's a dialectic of two cultures. In his coloration and worldliness he's more the Anglo-Saxon frontiersman. In his independent views and candid manner and in his combat skills and woodsmanship, he's more native American (Mohican). As Chingachgook takes out his long knife and they approach the fallen elk ...] CHINGACHGOOK (low Mohican; sub-titled) We're sorry to kill you, Brother. Forgive us. I do honor to your courage and speed, your strength ... \nCUT TO ... \nEXTERIOR - INTERIOR CAMERON CABIN - JOHN CAMERON - NIGHT \nroasts potatoes on a stick in the stone fireplace next to CAPTAIN JACK WINTHROP, an American in very worn quasi-military gear. On a rough table in the tiny cabin ALEXANDRIA, his wife, is kneading bread. Three children climb on their father. He grabs their wild seven year old son, JAMES, who shrieks laughter and dodges away. The cabin has two primitive rooms, waxed paper windows, log walls. O.S. a dog barks. Others pick it up. Cameron & Jack are suddenly alert, reaching for weapons ... \nCUT TO ... \nMARTIN (translates) My father says he was driven out of France by the black robe priests and he would fight them now but he lost his arm and so I will go in his place. \nMeanwhile ... \nONGEWASGONE \nis an unusually large Mohawk in a blue match coat with a little girl holding his hand. He says something to Chingachgook who nods. Hawkeye and Uncas are a little apart in an outer grouping of the men. Ongewasgone is a war chief and wears a white plume and is tattooed. As Martin finishes, he steps forward. \nONGEWASGONE John Cameron, thank you for your hospitality ... Twin River Mohawk got no quarrel with Les Francais. Trade furs with Les Francais. Now Les Francais bring Huron onto Mohawk hunting grounds ... \nThese people are English, Scots-Irish and Dutch farmers; some French Huguenot \"mechanics\" (craftsmen). They're in shirt-sleeves and Indian moccasins & leggings. The Mohawks' vast lands and corn agriculture border the settlement. They 've been acculturated for over a hundred years. Some wear European calico hunting shirts. Their heads are shaved to scalping locks and many are tattooed. They've politically and commercially played France & England against each other very adroitly for over a hundred years because of their military power and geographic position. Their relations with working farmers and settlers and their families has been mostly one of co-existence because there's always been more than enough for all. This is a WPA mural of ethnic diversity and plurality of frontier America. The Europeans are former indentured laborers, farmers exiled by economics or religious persecution, frontier hunters and trappers ... working people. \nONGEWASGONE (continues) Now Mohawk will fight Huron and Les Francais. My brothers have asked me to lead them in this war so I speak for the Twin River Council. \nThe importance of this commitment is apparent to the lieutenant. \nLIEUTENANT His Majesty King George II is very grateful for your support. \nIAN How far up the valley? \nLIEUTENANT To Fort William Henry. \nCOLONIAL #1 ... two days from here. \nSome don't like this. \nLIEUTENANT It should be enough to remind you France is the enemy. \nHAWKEYE Your enemy ... \nHeads turn to Hawkeye at the periphery of the crowd. \nLIEUTENANT What did you say? \nHAWKEYE (loud) I said ... France is your enemy. Not ours. \nLIEUTENANT Really? Do you want them to overrun all New York colony? \nHAWKEYE First place, you started it with the French over fur-trapping claims to the head waters of the Ohio. (smiles) Now you're sayin' these people have a fight on their hands ... \nLIEUTENANT (ignoring Hawkeye) Will you men help us stop the French? \nHAWKEYE ... and while they are cooped up in your fort, what if the French send war parties to raid their homes? \nIAN What then, Lieutenant? \nLIEUTENANT For your own homes, for king, for country, that's why you men ought to join this fight! \nHAWKEYE You do what you want with your own scalp. Do not be tellin' us what to do with ours. \nLIEUTENANT (furious; to Hawkeye) You, sir! You call yourself a loyal subject? \nHAWKEYE ... No ... Do not call myself much of a subject at all. \nLight laughter. \nCOLONIAL #2 Nathaniel's right. But if I got to fight, figure I'll try and do it fifty miles north of here instead of my bean field. \nAD LIBS Yes. Yeah. No ... \nCAMERON I am stayin' on my farm. And any man who goes, his family is welcome to fort-up with us 'til he comes back. \nJACK Boys. My sense of it is enough of us will join-up to fill the county's levy. But only if General Webb accepts a few terms I got in mind ... \nHAWKEYE & UNCAS \ncross through the people. A few men drift off to their women at the tables. It is apparent two-thirds of the men will join. A couple of jokes, light banter, no hostility. \nAD LIBS (O.S.) Webb? what's that, Jack ...? \nAs they cross through they start removing their shirts and weapons. \nIAN You boys marchin' with us? What do you say? \nUNCAS We had our say, Ian. \nThey approach the Lacrosse field. Chingachgook stands with Cameron in the background, watching. \nLACROSSE FIELD \nUncas joins James. Hawkeye goes on the other side. A couple of young Mohawks and a young blonde farmer shout hallo's and as the bodies crash into each other ... \nCUT TO ... \nEXTERIOR BRITISH ENCAMPMENT, PARADE GROUND - SIX HUNDRED 62nd REGIMENT OF FOOT - DAY \nin two rows. At each command the crack troops respond en masse. Their hands slap the stocks of their brown bess muskets in unison. These men are drilling in preparation for war. We witness a state-of-the-art, 18th century, precision killing machine. \nREGIMENTAL SGT. MAJOR (shouts) Shoulder arms! (slam) Order arms! Handle cartridge! (men bite the paper) Prime! (powder dropped in pan) Load! Draw ramrods! Ram cartridge! Return ramrod! Make ready! (muskets at chest height) Pre-sent! (muskets shouldered) Make ready! (muskets returned to chests) Pre-sent! (muskets returned to shoulder) Fire! \nLike a single shot, two hundred fifty black powder muskets fire .65 caliber lead shot at chest height in a scythe of death. \nSERGEANT MAJOR Prime! Load! \nHEYWARD (to Magua) Dawn. At the encampment. Six a.m. sharp. See to it you're there. \nBeneath Magua's barely deferential manner we sense intelligence & menace. None of \tthese Brits see it. We do. \nCUT TO ... \nEXTERIOR POLTROON'S HOUSE - DUNCAN HEYWARD - DAY \nbrushed clean, his wig freshly powdered, his tricorn in his hand with a crimson sash and sword and his cavalry boots, walks through the gate after knocking. He enters a small courtyard. Suddenly he hears ... \nCORA (O.S.) Heyward! Duncan Heyward. \nHeyward looks to the side. An inner light turns on. In this mode, this is a man we could like. \nREVERSE: CORA MUNRO \nenters from the garden. She's vivacious, dark-haired, unconventional in that she's educated, but with conventional values and attitudes. She hugs Duncan to her and then pushes him away to look at him. \nHEYWARD My God it's good to see you. \nHe takes her hand in both of his and kisses it. He is open and lit up. \nCUT TO ... \nEXTERIOR POLTROON'S HOUSE, BACK YARD - CORA & HEYWARD - DAY \nA vegetable plot behind the Poltroon's house is a provincial substitute for a formal garden setting. Heyward and Cora sit on rough wooden chairs. Wind blows. In the background a servant hangs laundry. The white sheets billow. A table holds a tea setting. They're sitting close to each other, talking seriously and quietly. Duncan's jacket is removed. Time's passed. Long pause. Then: \nCORA I'm embarrassed to be so indecisive ... after so long apart and after you've traveled so far ... \nHEYWARD And by sea! \nCORA You still have an aversion to the water? \nHEYWARD Aversion? No. ... \"Hatred\" ... \"Loathing\" ... \nCora laughs. \nHEYWARD But it was worth it all to end in a garden by your side. \nShe looks askance at him. Then the banter drops. \nCORA (difficult) Dear Duncan, my affection is as towards a closest friend. Alice and I depend on you and respect you immensely ... I wish they did, but my feelings don't go beyond that. Do you see? \nHEYWARD Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined? And all else may grow in time ...? \nCORA Some say that's the way of it. \nHEYWARD \"Some\"? \nCORA Cousin Eugenie, my father, but ... \nHEYWARD (interrupts) Cora, in my heart, I know once we're joined, we'll be the happiest couple in England. Let those whom you trust, your father, help settle what's best for you. In view of your indecision, why not rely on their advice and judgment as well as mine? \nCora stares directly at Heyward. Then she looks away. She has no answer. Something subterranean disturbs her about delegating judgment over the fate of her life. \nHEYWARD Will you consider that? \nCORA (pause; smiles) Yes. Yes, I will. \nShe's still unsettled. \nALICE (O.S.) Duncan! \nREVERSE: ALICE MUNRO \neighteen years old, white-blonde hair, wide blue eyes. She's effervescent and runs to hug him. Heyward is taken aback by her enthusiasm and laughs. \nHEYWARD My God, you've grown up. \nALICE We leave in the morning?! \nHEYWARD (rises) Yes, miss. \nALICE I won't sleep tonight. What an adventure! I absolutely cannot wait to return to Portman Square, having laid eyes upon the full-blooded, red men in the wild! \nCORA My God, Alice. \nHEYWARD (smiles) It can be dangerous ... \nALICE Nonsense. Papa wouldn't have sent for us if it were dangerous. \nAlice takes Hewyward's hand. Cora pours Heyward more tea. The white sheets billow. \nAMBROSE (O.S. - barks) Atten-shun! \nCUT TO ... \nEXTERIOR BRITISH ARMY HQ - TWENTY BRITISH REGULARS - DAY \njolt upright as if electrified. \nAMBROSE (entering) Shoulder arms! \nhas headed off further down the stream and discovers nothing. Rapidly he rejoins Uncas and Hawkeye who've become extremely alert. They move up the bank into the forest ninety degrees from their previous path. \nTRACKING: HAWKEYE, UNCAS & CHINGACHGOOK \nmoving. Fast. Nearly soundless. They hardly disturb a blade of grass. The impression: expertise, deadliness and an impression something's wrong. \nCUT TO ... \nEXTERIOR FOREST, TRAIL - MAGUA - DAY \non point. The trail cuts the side of a hill. The ground on one side rises into a forest acclivity and on the other falls off into a forested ravine. Magua walking towards camera. \nCLOSER - MAGUA'S \nslid his tomahawk out from the front of his belt that girdles his waist. He lets the shaft drop into his hand. He shrugs off his blanket. There is a solidity to his dark, tall figure we didn't see before. Magua turns about face and advances on the column. TRACK WITH Magua. Heyward and the Munro girls pass the camera as does Sgt. Major Ambrose, marching in advance of the men. Magua is approaching the soldier on the left in the first row. We see Magua has caught the Redcoat's eye. \nREDCOAT \nis curious, starts to smile. What does the Huron want to say to him? When Magua is two steps away he caves in the side of the infantryman's head at the temple with the spike end of his tomahawk and, backhanded, hacks the blade through the side of the neck of the center man in the first row. \nSIMULTANEOUSLY \nthirteen muskets EXPLODE from the wooded rise. \nFIVE REDCOATS \nare blown off the path, two others are wounded ... \nAMBROSE \nAMBROSE Form company! Left face! March! \nALICE \nshrieks. Cora grabs Alice's reins and her own. \nHEYWARD \npulling his fusil (short musket), seeing, firing, reaching for the women ... \nCORA'S HORSE \nbucking. \nALICE'S HORSE \nbolting, dodging sideways, spilling Alice to the earth. \nAMBROSE \nAMBROSE Company make ready! \nThe regulars slam into a firing line, stepping over the bodies of their comrades. All thirteen face the incline. \nFORESTED RISE - HURONS \nflash downhill through the trees. Partnered in two-man teams, one loads and prepares and fires while the other advances to the next cover. He, then, prepares and fires covering his partner's advance. Leaping fallen trees and boulders, they're athletic, fast and rapidly closing. Even though the disciplined English regulars are a killing machine, we now see their tactics in the dense forest are grossly inferior to the Hurons' ... \nAMBROSE Present!! \nCORA \ncovers Alice with her body, holding the reins of their bolting horses. \nHEYWARD \nfrom horseback aims his horse pistol, FIRES ... \nAN ATTACKING HURON \nleaping at him past Alice & Cora drops. \nMULE \nwith baggage crashes off, down the ravine. Another two Redcoats drop. Nine left. Then eight. \nAMBROSE \nAMBROSE Fire!! \nA musket volley as eight muskets go off as one shot, sending a lead scythe through leaves. But ... \nREVERSE: \nHurons were behind cover. Only one was exposed and hit. \nAMBROSE (continuing) Load! Prime! \nThe English rush to complete the reload. Will they do it in time? \nAMBROSE (continuing) Present! Present! \nSuddenly, Hurons - en masse - CRASH down onto the Redcoats line with tomahawks, war clubs and point-blank musket fire. \nHEYWARD'S MUSKET \nis jerked from his hands. \nHAWKEYE ... case your aim is any better'n your judgment. \nHe's drawn his sword, reflexively. Hawkeye flips the musket around one-handed. It's pointed at Heyward's chest. And Hawkeye FIRES, killing an attacking Huron behind Heyward. As Heyward spins ... \nCHINGACHGOOK'S WAR CLUB \nflashes up the hill. It cleaves the second man's back and bowls him over. Chingachgook retrieves his club as his scalping knife slashes down ... \nUNCAS \nscalps the man he killed. Chingachgook dispatches the Huron he hamstrung. \nWIDE \nSudden silence. Heyward's motionless. The women are frozen, as terrified of the savages and apparent half-breed rescuers as they were of those who attacked them. \nALICE \nCora, holding her, is stunned but functioning. Moments ago both women were clean and demure. Now their riding dresses are torn, mud-stained, blood-spattered and their baggage is gone. \nHEYWARD'S \ncrossed to his slaughtered soldiers. Moments ago they were a testament to British military power. Now they're dead meat. Ambrose's body is against a tree. In the B.G. \ttwo of the wounded start to rise ... \nALICE (O.S.) Stop it! \nHeyward spins. \nUNCAS \njust cut the throat of the second Narraganset. It drops into the brush. Alice attacks him. \nALICE We need them to get out of here! \nUncas gently restrains her. Cora reaches Alice and grabs her away from the \"savage\". Heyward runs in to protect the women ... \nHEYWARD (to Nathaniel) ... why the bloody hell he do that to the horses?! \nUncas, all business, is now reloading, lifting powder horns, scanning the trees. \nUNCAS (matter of fact) ... too easy to track ... they can be heard for miles ... find yourself a musket ... \nCora's surprised by Uncas' easy English. Hawkeye's scanning the forest. \nHAWKEYE (to Heyward) Your wounded should try walkin' back to Albany. They'll never make a passage north. \nHEYWARD (breathless) We were headed ... \nHAWKEYE (appropriating a knife) ... Fort William Henry. \nCHINGACHGOOK \nto Hawkeye: let's go ... Then a fast exchange of Delaware. Cora's surprised to see it's Chingachgook's decision. Chingachgook looks at the survivors, gives his assent, starts off. \nHAWKEYE ... take you as far as the fort. \nHawkeye throws Heyward a musket. Cora & Alice look towards Heyward. He looks at them: the women are totally terrified and do not move. \nHAWKEYE If we are goin' to take you, we need to move. Fast ... And the fort is well off our course. So if you all rather wait for the next Huron war party to come by, we'll be on our way. \nHeyward quickly decides to go. The women follow. Hawkeye starts off after Uncas and Chingachgook. \nCUT TO ... \nEXTERIOR FOREST - HAWKEYE - DAY \nmoves through the trackless forest. Uncas is far out on the left flank. Cora, Alice & Duncan Heyward follow in Hawkeye's and Chingachgook's steps ... \nHAWKEYE'S FEET \nwalking through a creek, stepping in the stream bed instead of on stones. The others follow. Hawkeye looks at Heyward. \nHEYWARD \nconforms. He's ill at ease not being in command, following the lead of some half-Indian frontiersman through a foreign wilderness.] \nHEYWARD How far is it, scout? \nHAWKEYE Day and a half (pause) Where did you get ... the guide? \nHEYWARD Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies. \nHAWKEYE He is Huron and nothing else. (checking the Munro girls are not too close) Why would he want to murder the girl? \nHEYWARD What?! \nHAWKEYE Dark haired ... \nHEYWARD Miss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on her before today. \nCHINGACHGOOK Leave them. \nHeyward stops. Hawkeye and Uncas follow Chingachgook, leaving the cabin. \nCORA (hasn't moved) Though they are strangers, they are at least entitled to a Christian burial! \nHAWKEYE (shaking his head) Let us go, miss. \nCORA I will not. I have seen the face of war before, Mr. Poe, but never war made on women and children. And almost as cruel is your indifference. \nHawkeye turns back and rapidly approaches her. She takes a step back, fearful. \nHAWKEYE (contained) Miss Munro. (pause) They are not strangers .... And they stay as they lay ...! \nCORA \nrealizes Hawkeye knew these people and is deeply affected. She also realizes for the first time this is a whole new world with dynamics and complexities, behavior and rhythms she doesn't understand. He turns away from her and walks on. She hesitates a moment. \nWIDE ON THE SMALL CLEARING IN FRONT OF THE FARMHOUSE \nas Chingachgook and Hawkeye, extremely alert and cradling their cocked flintlocks, walk to camera, eyes sweeping the forest perimeter; they're followed by Cora, Heyward helping Alice and Uncas as rearguard. \nThe ruined cabin and the dead dream of a family smolders behind them. \nCUT TO ... \nEXTERIOR GLADE - PROFILE: HAWKEYE - NIGHT \nmoves through to where the trees seem sparse and are unnaturally white birch and some thin grass grows. The land rises into a mound. Chingachgook and the others avoid stepping on the grass and cross to the other side of it. \nCHINGACHGOOK \nmutters something to Uncas. He nods and disappears amongst the white birch, soundlessly. \nHAWKEYE \nthrows Heyward a blanket. Heyward spreads the blanket below the top of the mound and - maintaining silence - he gestures for Cora & Alice to rest there. \nALICE'S HEAD \nhits the blanket. She curls into a fetal position and she's out. Heyward is nearby on watch. Hawkeye has taken a position two-thirds of the way around the crescent shaped mound. Cora has sought him out. \nHAWKEYE \ndoesn't react as Cora enters. He's scanning the trees; not looking at her. They whisper ... \nCORA Why didn't you bury those people? \nHAWKEYE Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing ... \nCORA You knew them. \nHawkeye looks at her and nods. \nCORA (stiffly) You were acting for our benefit. And I apologize. I misunderstood you. \nHAWKEYE Well that is to be expected. My father ... \nCORA Your \"father\"? \nHAWKEYE Chingachgook. He warned me about people like you. \nCORA He did? \nHAWKEYE Yes. He said ... \"do not try to make them understand you.\" \nCORA What?! \nHAWKEYE Yes. And \"do not try to understand them. That is because they are a breed apart and they make no sense ...\" \nCora's indignation is cut off because ... \nUNCAS \nmoving fast. He gestures back the way he came and it means they're in jeopardy. Uncas disappears around the mound. \nCUT TO ... \nEXTERIOR BIRCH FOREST - TREES - NIGHT \nNothing. Imperceptibly we move closer and start to see shapes blocking out part of the white birch. \nRED-PAINTED FACE \nwhite eyes. A ruff of red hair stands straight up at the back of the large man's head. Slit and monstrously elongated earlobes are weighted with silver. He's followed by others. Wary, silently, they hunt. \nDEEPER: MORE OTTAWA \nTowards the rear are two French Rangers (\"Coureurs des Bois\") from Le Regiment de la Sarre. They're bearded, dirty, dressed Indian-style in moccasins, leggings and breechcloths with hooded hunting shirts. There's nothing clumsy about them. They're the 18th century version of Special Forces who've gone indigenous. If they and the Ottawa find our people, it's all over. \nALICE \nseeing the red-painted Ottawa approach, starts to panic. Her hyperventilating and involuntary small sounds of fear will reveal their position. A hand covers her mouth and silences her struggling. WIDEN. It's Uncas. His other arm is around her, holding her, looking towards the advancing Ottawa. \nCORA There was none! \nMUNRO What? \nCORA There was no letter. \nMUNRO I sent three men to Webb! \nHEYWARD One called Magua arrived. \nCORA He delivered no such message. \nMunro's stunned. \nMUNRO Does Webb not even know we are besieged? \nHEYWARD Sir. Webb has no idea. And he certainly does not know to send reinforcements! \nMunro has nowhere for his rage to go. Meanwhile, Alice clings to her father. At 45-55, the British Army has been his life. He blindly believes in its institutions, though officers like Webb would disdain his Scots origins. From under his fury: \nMUNRO (flat) What happened to you? \nHEYWARD (suddenly tired) Ambush ... on the George Road. This Magua led us into it. (pause) ... eighteen killed. It's these men who saved us. They guided us here ... \nMUNRO Thank you. How can I reward you? \nNo answer. Then ... \nHAWKEYE Help ourselves to a few horns from your powder stores. \nMUNRO What else? \nUNCAS Some food. \nMUNRO (to Uncas) I'm indebted to you. And get your side sewn up, young man. \nMUNRO \nsees his exhausted and bloodstained surgeon in the doorway that leads to the next rooms. \nMUNRO (bellows) Mr. Phelps! \nPHELPS' face lights up when he sees Cora Munro. \nPHELPS Miss Cora! How are you? \nCORA (smiles) Fine, Mr. Phelps. Have you cat gut and a suturing needle? (for Uncas) And we could use some rum, clothes, and a place to wash ... \nCora tries to remove Alice from her father, but she clings to him. Munro holds her tighter. Then he whispers something to her. She nods her head. And Cora takes her. They exit. \nMUNRO \nis moved beyond words by his daughters' presence. There's a break, a pause ... \nMUNRO (to Heyward over table map) What a place for them ... \nHEYWARD Might I enquire after the situation, sir, given that I've seen of the French engineering from the ridge above? \nMUNRO (perfunctory) Logistics are his guns are bigger than mine and he has more of them. They keep our heads down while his sappers make thirty yards of trench a day. His thirteen inch mortars have a two hundred yard range, so when they're close enough, they'll move them in, lob explosive rounds over our walls and pound us to dust. \nHEYWARD They look to be three hundred yards out. You have three days. \nMUNRO Bloody murderers. \nHAWKEYE A man, here, can make a run straight through to Webb. \nMUNRO ... not enough time to get to Albany and back with reinforcements ... \nA Sergeant enters, snaps to attention, says something to Beams, exits. \nHEYWARD Webb's not in Albany. He marched the 33rd to Fort Edward two days ago. \nMUNRO Webb's at Edward? \nHEYWARD Yes, sir. \nMUNRO Only twelve miles away! He could be here day after tomorrow. (to Hawkeye) Find your man, sir! Captain Beams will give you the message. \nBeams nods. Munro turns back to the map. Hawkeye has something else to say. \nHAWKEYE John Cameron's cabin. We come upon it last night. Burned out. Everyone murdered. And it was Ottawa. They're allied to the French. \nMunro looks at him. \nMUNRO Yes, Mr. Poe? So? \nHAWKEYE It was a war party. It means they're on the attack up and down the frontier. \nMunro turns to look at him for a long beat. Munro doesn't like what his response must be to this news. He turns to Heyward and the map. \nMUNRO (cold) Thank you. \nHawkeye's dismissed, frozen out. \nHAWKEYE (to Uncas) You 'bout done holdin' hands with Miss Munro? \nUncas laughs, looking from her to Hawkeye. Then he's up and he hurts. Cora starts to tend another wounded man. As they start out, Hawkeye hesitates. Sensing it, Cora turns. \nCORA What are you looking at, Mr. Poe? \nHAWKEYE Why, I am looking at you, Miss. \nCora measures the directness of Hawkeye's manner. It's not insolent, only unsettling. Feeling foolish; she turns. He leaves. \nCUT TO ... \nEXTERIOR FRENCH TRENCHES - SAPPEURS & ENGINEERS - \tNIGHT \nhaving worked through the night, are still digging the diagonally-advancing trench. We note it's closer than it was. \nEXTERIOR FRENCH TRENCHES - FRENCH PICKETTS \nat their posts guard the sappeurs. Meanwhile ... \nCUT TO ... \nEXTERIOR FORT WILLIAM HENRY, WEST SIDE - SALLY-PORT - NIGHT \nopens. Ten Mohawks and Rangers crawl towards the French lines. Meanwhile ... \nCUT TO ... \nEXTERIOR FORT WILLIAM HENRY, PARAPET - HAWKEYE & UNCAS - NIGHT \nare low and out of French sight in the northeast battery. Four others are with them, including Captain Jack. Stacked rifles are against the casement. We don't know why. Each rifle is within reach of Hawkeye's hand. Hawkeye is taking extra care loading Killdeer. He charges it once, then overloads the powder by a quarter charge. \nUNCAS You told him about the raid? \nHAWKEYE (nods) He does not want to hear it. (pause) But he is gonna have to. \nJACK (to one man) Get together by the West Battery James & Ian, Sharitarish & William. \nHawkeye uses the fine cotton he took from Cora. Uncas sees it. \nUNCAS Tight weave. \nHAWKEYE Another forty yards? \nUncas nods. Hawkeye wets it to make a tighter gas seal and rams it home. The tighter fit requires more effort. \nHAWKEYE \nlooks below to ground level ... \nA FRONTIERSMAN - COURIER \nTwo pistols are holstered in a sash around his chest. He wears no hat and carries no pack. He waits by the sally-port door. \nCUT TO ... \nEXTERIOR FRENCH TRENCH - THREE PICKETS - NIGHT \nare suddenly tomahawked and knifed by stripped down 42nd Highlanders and Mohawks. Alarm is raised. French and some Huron run to advance. Shots are fired. The Rangers & Mohawks fall back. \nFRENCH \nemboldened, pursue ... \nTRENCH IN FRONT OF WEST WALL \nsuddenly Heyward and three companies of the 62nd regiment of Foot (60 men) are over the top in perfect formation ... \nHEYWARD Sergeant! Form three ranks! \nSERGEANT MAJOR Sir! (bellows to troops) Upon the center, wheel to the left-about! March! (three motions; drums) Rear ranks, proper distance! (the rear ranks back up six paces) Front ranks, take your distance! March! (everybody moves) Halt! (in unison they slam to a stop) Make ready! (muskets snap to port arms) \nMOHAWKS & HIGHLANDERS \ndodge right & left of the 62nd's line of fire. \nFRENCH \nare coming forward. Their sergeants trying to stop and form their men in ad-libbed French. \n62ND REGIMENT OF FOOT \nSERGEANT MAJOR (dead cool) First rank! Second rank! Present arms! (muskets shouldered) \nHEYWARD Fire!!! \nLike one shot, lightening, smoke and .65 caliber death screams from the first two ranks like a scythe, cutting down ... \nREVERSE: FRENCH \nFourteen wounded or killed ... \n62ND REGIMENT OF FOOT - HEYWARD \nCORA & ALICE \nAlice is in her father's bed. Cora is collecting and tearing linen into strips for bandaging. \nHEYWARD Cora ... I wanted to talk to you, but I'll come back another time ... \nAlice looks at the two of them and rises out of the bed. \nCORA Alice ... \nALICE Talk to Duncan, Cora ... I must manage ... I cannot be an invalid schoolgirl. (starts for door) I'll see if Mr. Phelps needs anything ... \nShe leaves. \nHEYWARD I'm sorry, I didn't mean to ... \nCORA Her nerves are shattered. She's trying to be brave. \nThere's a lot going on under Cora's surface. We don't know what it is, but it's disconcerting. \nHEYWARD Cora, I adore you and, when we come together, we will be the happiest couple in England ... I am certain of that. More than ever before. (softens) I believe you must trust the judgment of others who hold your welfare so close to their hearts ... \nCORA Duncan ... (pause) Duncan, I promised you an answer. You have complimented me with your persistence and patience ... But the decision I've come to is I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment. \nHeyward is stunned. \nCORA And it's been unfair to you, while I search myself for feelings, which, if they were there and as strong as they ought to be, would've made themselves known long ago ... (pause) Take my admiration and friendship, Duncan. And please take this as my final answer. It must be no. \nHeyward' shattered inside. \nHEYWARD I see ... \nCORA I am sorry, Duncan ... \nHeyward nods. He's speechless. He's errect as he leaves the room. \nCLOSE: CORA \nThe tension rushes out of her and she shudders and leans against the quarter-timbered walls for support. Then she collects the linen and starts out. \nCUT TO ... \nINTERIOR FORT, INNER CORRIDOR - CORA \nmoving through the corridor past wounded. Two French mortar bombs explode above one of the casements. We hear shrill screams in the distance and ... \nHAWKEYE (O.S.) ... it was no raidin' party out for pillage. The cabin was attacked by a war party. They are sweeping south down the frontier spreading terror among farms and Mohawk villages 'cos all the men are here. \nIAN (O.S.) And my cabin's not thirteen miles south of Cameron's! \nCora, passing the open door to Munro's crowded office, now hesitates. \nCORA'S POV: THE ROOM \nHawkeye, Captain Jack Winthrop, Ian, seven or eight other militia spokesmen, Munro, Heyward, two adjutants, one lieutenant of Rangers. \nMUNRO (to Jack) I must receive proof more conclusive than Mr. Poe's opinion before I weaken our defenses by allowing militia to withdraw. \nJACK Chingachgook's of the same opinion. Taken together, that's gospel. Your fort will\t stand or fall depending on Webb and reinforcements, not these colonials' presence. \nMUNRO I judge military matters, Captain Winthrop, not you. \nHAWKEYE That judgment is not more important than their right under agreement with Webb to defend their farms & families ... Major Heyward was at John Cameron's. He saw what it was. \nMUNRO (looking to Heyward for confirmation of his point of view) What did you see, Major? \nHeyward looks around the room. And he catches the doorway ... \nCORA \nbeyond the periphery of men, staring at him. \nHEYWARD \nMunro is expecting him to be the good soldier in defense of British military interests. At the same time ... \nCORA \nexamines him with a cool, level stare. \nHEYWARD \nlooks at Munro. More French rounds detonate O.S. What if Webb gets here and they need to launch a counter-attack? They need every man they have. It's his moment of decision ... \nHEYWARD (to Munro) I saw nothing that would lead me to the conclusion it was other than a raid by savages bent on thievery. \nJack Winthrop grabs Nathaniel. \nHAWKEYE You're a liar! \nCORA'S \nsaddened. Heyward's stature has fallen irrevocably in her eyes. \nThe men split up ... \nCUT TO ... \nFIRE - HAWKEYE \nwanders among the dancers and musicians clustered in groups, lit by the firelight. Someone catches his eye and he moves in that direction ... \nHAWKEYE'S POV: CORA \nin the shadows, leaning against the wall, searching ... we sense she's been looking for him. He comes up to her. She turns in surprise. \nCLOSER \nSomehow she breathes easier because he's there. She's in a white shirt with the sleeves rolled up. Hawkeye leads her away from some of the people. \nCORA & HAWKEYE \nHawkeye takes Cora's hand. Cora is awakening to a new spirit, a new wind blowing through a new land, a new self-determination ... She's drawn to this rough yet graceful man with his direct manner. Hawkeye settles against a wall. She leans next to him. Their shoulders touch. \nCORA \nTo her everything about him seems to be somehow right. She's discovered that the passions and outrage that move him, move her ... And her readiness to give herself to what stirs the deepest resonances of her soul is the same as his. \nHAWKEYE \nlooks at her. She's beautiful in the firelight. Cora's eyes find his and she folds into his arms. His lips find hers and tears stream down her face. She's suffused with an elation she can't explain. In the night before doomsday a romance is born in rebellion amid the huddled people in this small stockade ripped from the black earth of the forests of a wild continent. \nCUT TO ... \nINTERIOR BARRACKS - LOW & WIDE - DAY \ndoor CRASHES inwards. Twelve British sentries storm in. Four bear torches. \nREVERSE: HAWKEYE, UNCAS, CHINGACHGOOK, TWO COLONIALS & SOME MOHAWKS \nare out of the bunks and moving with them with tomahawks, knives, a flintlock ... \nSERGEANT (O.S.) You! Halt! \nBRITISH SENTRIES \ntheir muskets aimed mostly at Hawkeye. \nSERGEANT As you were!! \nHawkeye freezes. The others slow down, indecisive ... Hawkeye drops his tomahawk and says something in Mohican to restrain Chingachgook and Uncas. The British in the torchlight with the long muskets and bayonets are an image out of Goya. \nSERGEANT Take him! \nHawkeye's spun around and while his hands are bound. \nCHINGACHGOOK (Mohican; subtitled) Why do they make my son prisoner? \nHAWKEYE (Mohican; subtitled) I helped Winthrop and the others leave ... This fight is not yours, father. I love you and my brother. And you should leave this place now and go to Can-tuck-ee ... \nCHINGACHGOOK (Mohican; subtitled) What will they do with my white son? \nOne of the guards - scared to death by Chingachgook - nervously fingers his musket. \nGUARD Get back from him! \nHEYWARD \nenters. \nHAWKEYE \nshrugs in answer to Chingachgook's question. \nHAWKEYE'S \nmoved out. As he passes Heyward, his eyes lock on his. \nCUT TO ... \nINTERIOR MUNRO'S QUARTERS - CORA - DAY \nCORA He saved us! We are alive only because of him ... \nWIDEN: \nHeyward, Munro, Cora. We've entered mid-argument. An adjutant comes and goes. Heyward and Munro are sensitive to appearances in front of the adjutant. Cora couldn't give a damn. \nMUNRO The man encouraged the colonials to desert in this very room, in my presence. He is guilty of sedition and must be tried and hanged like any other criminal, regardless of what he did for my children. \nCORA He knew the consequences. And he stayed. Are those the actions of a criminal? ... Duncan, do something. \nHEYWARD He knew the penalty for breaking regulations. He ought to pay without sending you to beg. \nCORA You know he wouldn't send me ...! You misrepresented what you saw and caused this. (frustrated) I, too, was at that farm. It was as he said ... \nMUNRO Not with enough certainty to outweigh British interests in this fort. \ncrosses to an awakened Cora. He touches her face. He's desperate to drill these next words into her brain. \nCORA What is it? \nHAWKEYE I don't know. Whatever happens you stay with your father. You stay among the officers. \nCora looks up at Hawkeye. We feel forboding. O.S. are heard drums ... \nCUT TO ... \nEXTERIOR FRENCH LINES - MUNRO, HEYWARD, BEAMS - DAY \nThe drums are from Munro's honor guard. They stop. \nREVERSE: FRENCH SOLDIERS \nMarquis de Montcalm, immaculate, backed by his guard of honor in white, grey and medium blue with six foot by eight foot regimental colors and the French flag (gold fleur-de-lis on a field of blue). \nFACES \nThey carried two hundred and forty-five bateaux across a ten mile portage, all their supplies and artillery, and then rowed down the length of Lake George to get here. To \tthem, assaulting this fort is the easy part. The drummers of the honor guard play a tattoo behind them. \nINDIAN FACES \nHuron, Ottawa, Osage, Choctaw, Fox ... hear the drum of the honor guard and wait. They're in war paint. Many tattoos. Split ears. The Osage scalping locks are hennaed red. Canadiens among them are bearded, dirty, half savage ... At their head ... \nMAGUA \nin full war paint, with a coterie of Huron warriors, silent, waiting. Drums. \nINTERIOR FORT - ENGLISH TROOPS (TABLEAUX) \ngrim, silent, watchful. \nCOLONIAL MILITIA & MOHAWK INDIANS IN WAR PAINT (TABLEAUX) \nwatching the parlay from a blown apart battery. Silent. \nWIDE: FRENCH & ENGLISH \nand their honor guards. Montcalm steps forward and sweeps his plumed hat to the ground in a courtly bow. Munro bows coldly. \nMONTCALM Colonel Munro, I have known you as a gallant antagonist. I am happy to make your acquaintance as a friend. \nMUNRO And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis. \nMONTCALM Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material ... mere chance has allowed me to array against you ... \nMUNRO Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason. \nMONTCALM You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender. \nMUNRO However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands. \nMONTCALM Honor that is freely accorded to courage, may be refused obstinacy ... These hills afford to us every opportunity to reconnoiter your works and I am possibly as well acquainted with your weak condition as you are yourselves. \nIs Webb really en route and Montcalm hopes to take the fort by duplicity before British reinforcements arrive? \nMUNRO Perhaps the General's glasses can reach to the Hudson and he knows the size and imminence of the army of Webb ...? \nMontcalm takes a moment to reply and appears genuinely sympathetic to Munro. \nMONTCALM (quietly) My scouts intercepted this dispatch intended for you. \nMunro is puzzled, suspicious. \nMONTCALM (to Bougainville) Read the dispatch. \nHEYWARD & MUNRO] \nBOUGAINVILLE (O.S. - reading) \"Colonel Munro - Fort William Henry. I have no men available to send to your rescue. It is impossible. I  advise you to seek terms for surrender. Signed Webb.\" \nMunro is rocked, as if struck by a blow. Bougainville hands Heyward the letter. \nHEYWARD (confirming) This is the signature of Webb. (to Munro) And I know the temper of our men. Rather than spend the war in a French prison hulk in Hudson Bay, they'd fight to the end. \nMUNRO (to Montcalm) You have heard your answer, Monsieur le Marquis. (salutes) \nMunro starts off. Montcalm stops him. \nMONTCALM Sir. (challengingly) I am incapable of mistreating brave men. I beg you not to sign the death warrant of so many until you have listened to my terms. \nMunro turns. \nMUNRO Such as ...? \nMONTCALM My master requires the fort be destroyed. But, for you and your comrades, there is no privilege that will be denied. None of your men will see the inside of a prison barge. They're free to go so long as they return to England and fight no more on this continent, and the civilian militia return to their farms. \nMUNRO Their arms? \nMONTCALM They may leave the fortress fully armed, but with no ammunition ... Other than that, ask what you wish. \nMunro's impressed with Montcalm's generosity. \nLong pause, wheels turn. Then: \nMAGUA Many things my French father cannot do, Magua can. \nMontcalm reacts as if he hadn't thought of that. \nMONTCALM As the English march away, our soldiers and the Canadiens will be drawn to the looting of the fort ... except for a small guard ... \nMagua abruptly leaves Montcalm. \nCUT TO ... \nEXTERIOR WOODS - MAGUA - NIGHT \nwalking back to the Huron camp. Reveal a Huron sub-chief has been in the woods, waiting for Magua. Now he joins him. They walk in silence. Then ... \nMAGUA (in Iroquois; re: Montcalm) I wonder at the blindness and pride of the white man. He believes only he knows how to speak falsely to make other men do his bidding. \nMagua exhales in derision. \nCUT TO ... \nEXTERIOR FORT, MAIN GATE - MUNRO - DAY \nat the end of the column, rides out on his horse. Both sides of the gate are jammed with armed French troops standing at attention. The French colors and honor guard are just outside the gate along with Bougainville, Chevalier de Levis, both on horseback as is - at the head - Montcalm. \nCLOSER: MUNRO \ntrots past his walking column out the gate. He does not look at the French. \nMONTCALM \nsalutes Munro and bows gravely from the saddle. \nCLOSER: MUNRO \nsalutes Montcalm. \nMUNRO (eyes forward) Monsieur, the fort is yours. \nMID-COLUMN - ON HEYWARD \nmarching with his 33rd Regiment of Foot well beyond the fort. The French troops have thinned out. Repressing shame, his backbone is rigid, his face is straight ahead. The 33rd marches in perfect cadence to the drum. In the B.G. Munro on his horse passes Heyward as he rides towards the front of his column. Heyward does not look at him. \nFRONT OF COLUMN - CORA WITH ALICE \non the back of a mare. Alice, living through a wide-awake nightmare, is huddled under the arm of her sister. They ride behind the standard bearers. In the B.G. her father is seen approaching and takes his position at their side. Cora looks down the column, sheilding her eyes against the sun. We know who she's looking for ... Hawkeye. \nCORA'S POV: THE COLUMN \nThe 62nd and 42nd Highlanders including Heyward ... thirty to forty women and a number of children - for safety - in the middle, some frontiersmen, Ongewasgone and many Mohawk, walking wounded. The column is still snaking its way out of the fort. No Hawkeye. \nCORA \nstraining to see. \nEXTERIOR FORT - PRISONERS \nbeing assembled, their hands shackled. Hawkeye is among twelve or thirteen. He stands erect, walking out of the gate. The French are starting to pour in to loot the interior. Hawkeye looks to his left about twenty paces in front of him and sees ... \nUNCAS & CHINGACHGOOK \non the other side of the column. Chingachgook cradles Killdeer as well as his own musket. They fall back to walk beside the prisoners on the other side of Hawkeye. Their eyes connect... We don't expect Hawkeye to stay shackled for the duration. \nRANK AND FILE FRENCH \nA few insults. The British soldiers answer. Nobody breaks rank. It's just talk. \nEXTERIOR ROAD - HAWKEYE \nHis eyes sweep the column snaking its way into the v-shaped valley. The path cuts through the forested hills ahead. He sees ... \nHAWKEYE'S DISTANT POV: CORA \nriding near the front where there are no more French soldiers. Only a few scattered and curious Huron and Ottawa. She does not see him. \nPROFILE OF COLUMN - HIGH & WIDE \nas it passes left to right below like a long snake through the narrow valley. We're shooting from inside the dark woods. Lower, in the light, we see a scattering on both slopes of a couple of hundred Ottawa and Huron. They are in no order, are spread out and don't constitute a threat. They watch the column. SLOWLY THE CAMERA ... slides across the shoulders and back of a large man wearing black plumes in his scalp-lock and other than a breechcloth is almost naked. He is heavily war-painted ... \nFRONTAL - MAGUA \nand the left two-thirds of his face is painted red. The right third is painted black. Much silver is in his ears. His tomahawk is in his left hand. His cut-down musket in his right fist. Magua's attention is all focused to one point. \nMAGUA'S LONG & TIGHT POV: MUNRO & CORA & ALICE \nat the head of the column. This is the focus of Magua's attention. \nWIDE FRONTAL: COLUMN, STANDARD BEARERS & MUNROS \nCora turns again to look for Hawkeye. \nCLOSER: CORA \ndraws his sword and is passing orders to his sergeant major, scanning the hills ... \nEXTERIOR FORESTED SLOPE - MAGUA \nHis eyes see Munro. \nWIDER & LOWER: MAGUA \nraises his musket in his fist and emits a war whoop. WE NOW SEE ... hundreds have been stalking the column, hidden in the trees, maybe thousands. Then ... \nWIDE: ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE \nFIRE from the trees crescendos within seconds revealing a spontaneous and massive ambush of mostly Hurons. They appear from behind every tree and it turns to a ROAR of musket fire, war whoops and screams as ... \nSOLDIERS & CIVILIANS \ndropping like flies and seemingly thousands of Hurons attack down both slopes. \nHAWKEYE \nis being unshackled by Uncas. The sergeant is rising from the ground where Chingachgook knocked him. Chingachgook throws Hawkeye Killdeer and Hawkeye shrugs into his pouch and powder horn as he races with Uncas for the head of the column ... \nEXTERIOR FORESTED SLOPE - MAGUA \ncharging down the hill ... with his coterie of twenty Huron warriors, heading for the area in which he saw Munro. \nCORA & ALICE \nat the head of the disintegrating column. Cora's holding Alice's head to her bosom, covering her ears as if to protect her from the sounds. \nHEYWARD \nshouting orders. \nSERGEANT MAJOR Right - about face! March! First rank present! \nHEYWARD Fire! \nREVERSE: \nThe volley knocks down fifteen of a horde of attacking Hurons. \nSERGEANT MAJOR Prime! Load! Second rank six paces forward! Present! \nHurons are twenty yards away and closing. \nHEYWARD Fire! \nAs the line of muskets belch smoke and fire ... \nWIDE: THE HILLS & PATH \nWe're shooting into the \"v\" of the valley with Hurons and other tribes pouring down from both sides. (IMPORTANT: the combined musket fire of Hurons, English and Mohawks generates tremendous clouds of smoke which obscure action, close off views, isolate pockets of combat into surreal tableaux that we'll move in and out of. \nBRITISH TROOPERS \nusing their useless muskets as clubs or with fixed bayonets - as the smoke and fog swirls among the men - fighting for their lives ... \nMAGUA \nglides through the scenes, striking and hunting. Some of his coterie of braves near him. He sees ... \nBLONDE WOMAN \nhugging the ground in fear. Magua throws her over. It's not Alice Munro. It's a woman protecting her baby. Magua walks on. One of the braves behind Magua raise his tomahawk. On his downswing ... \nHAWKEYE \nrunning through surreal patches, thinks he glimpses Cora two hundred yards away. \nHAWKEYE Cora! \nChingachgook, on Hawkeye's left, slams down two Hurons with his war club. \nCORA & ALICE \nrunning through the chaos and murder and British troopers and Mohawks locked in struggle with Hurons. Cora's dress is torn. She holds Alice to her. There's a pistol in Cora's hand. \nONE HURON \nscalping a prone soldier, rips the trophy from his head, turns and faces us. \nCORA \nshoots him in the face. \nEXTREMELY CLOSE: ALICE \nand her eyes take it all in. And her affect starts to flatten. A blankness suffuses her expression and the girl withdraws from this reality into a deep dark cave inside her head. \nHAWKEYE \nlocked in combat. He tomahawks one Huron's arm with a slashing downstroke and comes right back into the face of the second with his backswing while his right hand fires Killdeer at ... \nRank two did not retreat six paces. They stand in confusion. Heyward looks to see what's wrong. \nHEYWARD'S POV: THE REMNANTS OF THE 33RD REGIMENT OF FOOT \nare standing in water. They're up against Lake George. Their backs are to the wall. Last stand. Heyward straightens. \nTWO FRENCH OFFICERS \non horseback try to intercede in the slaughter of five women. One French officer is shot by a Huron. The other French officer runs through that Huron and shoots the second. Then his horse is shot out from under him and he goes down ... \nJESUIT \npleads with an Abnaki to give up a child he's holding by the legs in one hand. He offers his cross. The Abnaki throws the baby to the Jesuit, Pere Roubaud. \nUNCAS \nsees a flash of something yellow. So does Hawkeye. They charge into the swirling chaos of attacking bodies. As we lose sight of them ... \nALICE \non her hands and knees. A massive Ottawa pulls her upright by her hair about to take her life and her scalp. He's struck by a rock in the hands of Cora which barely phases him. He bats her aside and returns to Alice, when suddenly ... \nOTTAWA WARRIOR \nis spun, punched and tomahawked into the ground by Hawkeye. Uncas has Alice and Cora ... \nTWO RANGERS AND A MOHAWK WARRIOR \nfrom the earlier group are nearby. They combine with Hawkeye to fight their way out with bayonets and tomahawks. \nHAWKEYE, UNCAS, CHINGACHGOOK, TWO RANGERS, A MOHAWK & MUNRO'S DAUGHTERS \nback through the swirling smoke. There seems to be a lull. Then they're hit from the side by musket fire. One of the Rangers is shot, the other wounded. Hurons attack. The Mohawk supports the wounded Ranger. \nHAWKEYE \nshields Cora as they back up. \nCHINGACHGOOK \nsmashing his war club straight down on a Huron, reaches for the man's musket and shoots another. Then he sees ... \nSMOKE DRIFTING OVER WATER \nIt's glass-smooth. And the bows are barely visible of three or four Huron war canoes. \nTHE SHALLOWS - HAWKEYE, CHINGACHGOOK, UNCAS, CORA, ALICE, THE RANGER & THE MOHAWK \nback into the water. They're pursued by Ottawa and Hurons as they fight their way to the canoes. \nCORA \nheld up by Hawkeye, suddenly screams. \nANGLE \nsomething underwater is pulling her down. An Ottawa brave rockets out of the shallows. Before he's erect, Hawkeye slams him back into the water and FIRES. \nWOUNDED RANGER \nhas shoved a large birch canoe at them. \nHAWKEYE \nSuddenly, the Mohawk fighting with them is shot and spins to face Hawkeye. His hands rest on Hawkeye's shoulders. Hawkeye looks into his face. Tries to hold him up, tries to rescue him. A frozen moment. Hawkeye's staring into his eyes and the man is staring into Hawkeye's as the light goes out ... Hawkeye lets him slide into the water and float away. He moves Cora and Alice towards the canoe ... \nCUT TO ... \nEXTERIOR LAKE GEORGE - WATER & SWIRLING SMOKE - DAY \nThe bottom of the frame is water like glass. Smoke obscures the background. Fingers tendril towards us. Out of the mist we HEAR small splashing and then the high bow of a war canoe defines itself. It's paddled towards us. \nHAWKEYE, CHINGACHGOOK & UNCAS \nCora's behind Hawkeye. Alice and the wounded Ranger are near Uncas. \nCLOSER: HAWKEYE & CORA \nCora looks left. Her eyes go wide. \nCORA No! \nHAWKEYE \nspins. \nHEYWARD & TWO TROOPERS OF THE 33RD IN A SECOND CANOE \nhave emerged from the smoke ten feet from them. Heyward's aiming a horse pistol at Hawkeye. \nHAWKEYE \nis non-plussed. He doesn't stop paddling. \nINTERIOR GLEN FALLS CAVE - HAWKEYE -NIGHT \nhears the distant howl. He's now lit silver blue by the moonlight through the falling water. Hawkeye knows it means Hurons are out there. He exchanges worried glances with Uncas & Chingachgook. \nUNCAS \nimmediately starts up the right acclivity to one fissure, and Chingachgook moves carefully to the first fissure. Hawkeye follows. \nHAWKEYE \nHis countenance gives way momentarily. All his experience seems of no avail. He touches the side of Cora's face. Grabs Killdeer and follows Chingachgook. \nALICE \nsensing new danger, slips away on her own. \nCORA \ncrosses to the Ranger who's semi-conscious, feverish and getting delirious. She can't do a thing except hold his hand and think of her father. \nCUT TO ... \nINTERIOR SOUTH FISSURE - HAWKEYE & CHINGACHGOOK \nbelow the edge, listen & wait, testing the environment with all their senses ... \nNORTH FISSURE - UNCAS \nagainst one wall, has his ear cocked, monitoring, facing away from the sky ... \nALICE \nlooks at the sky through the fissure. She sees the starfields and feels silver moonlight pull her forward. She starts out onto the island, oblivious, unaware she'll expose them. Suddenly ... \nUNCAS \nyanks her down next to him. He pulls her head into his chest, looking out over the edge, his tomahawk in front of him, his musket near his right hand. There is no sign she was seen. \nUNCAS & ALICE \nHe relaxes, looks at her and puts his finger to his lips telling her to be silent. Languorously, she lies back, closes her eyes and lays a hand on his shoulder, palm up, as if he were a prince in a romantic fantasy. Uncas tries to restrain her. \nALICE'S \neyes slowly open. Oblivion disappears. It's replaced with escalating fear. She holds onto Uncas with desperation. Her fingers claw his shoulders. She buries her face in his chest. \nALICE Uncas ... \nHer body shudders. Her terror's total. He tries to restrain and calm her. She won't let him. Then her mouth seeks his and in the passion of despair and fear and wanting life, she holds him between her thighs. And Uncas is confused, but Alice whispers his name and he responds. He loves her in the half-light. \nUNCAS \nhis hand buried in her hair irradiated by the moon, then she seems to reach some emotional climax and begins to cry softly, and Uncas stops making love to her and holds her. Then she's flooded with shame. He reaches for her. She jerks away. He reaches for her again and clutches her to him. And she breaks down. Then he turns her face to him, but her expression has completely flattened. \nWIDER ANGLE \nShe's not a lover to Uncas now. She's pitiful & stricken and he comforts her. \nCUT TO ... \nEXTERIOR RIVER - MAGUA - NIGHT \nbeaches a canoe on the bank. He and eight braves ease out. His war paint is fresh: green handprints on his chest and black and green on his face. Black plumes are affixed to his scalp-lock and his shawl is over his left shoulder. The right arm carrying his musket is exposed. Many scalps are tied to his tomahawk. He walks towards us approaching the island, two hundred yards away ... \nCUT TO ... \nINTERIOR SOUTH FISSURE - HAWKEYE - NIGHT \nchecks his powder horn. Nearly empty. He looks at Chingachgook. \nCUT TO ... \nINTERIOR GLEN FALLS ISLAND, CAVE - CORA - NIGHT \nwith the Ranger, looks up. Hawkeye enters. The look on his face. Then hers. They've been discovered. Now they're backed into a hole in the ground with no powder and no way out. \nCUT TO ... \nINTERIOR GLEN FALLS, CAVE - HAWKEYE & CHINGACHGOOK - NIGHT \nChingachgook talks to him in Mohican. Momentarily the anger and frustration is seen on Hawkeye's face. All his experience & craft has been to no avail. He looks at Cora. Back to Chingachgook. Chingachgook states something terse in Mohican. Hawkeye agrees. Heyward's confused. He doesn't know what they're talking about. Cora has understood Chingachgook's intent perfectly. \nCORA Yes. Go ahead. \nHEYWARD (explodes) What the bloody hell plan is this? \nHAWKEYE (to Cora) In this there is a chance. If I live, I can try to free you. If we don't go, there is no powder, there's too many of them. Though my heart would keep me here, in that there is no chance. None. I can do nothing. Do you understand? \nCORA Yes. I want you to go. \nHEYWARD Coward! Coward back at the fort. Coward here. \nHawkeye uses discipline not to kill the man. \nCHINGACHGOOK'S POV: WATER \nrocketing at us, battering and drowning us. We glimpse something downstream ... \nCHINGACHGOOK \ntries to focus, slammed against rocks, he's striking out towards the right, swimming against the current. He's grabbing for something. \nKILLDEER'S MUZZLE \nand leather shoulder-strap. Chingachgook's hand grabs it. The current rushing past tries to steal him from Uncas and Hawkeye, who're also beaten, bloodied, exhausted. They pull the older, larger man from the water and ... \nON THE ROCK \nall three lie there, almost devoid of energy. Then Hawkeye rises, looks at the others. Chingachgook nods. He's up.

Magua give Yengeese Major much wampum, many gifts, maybe three, four oxen. \nMagua looks at Heyward derisively. Does this white man think he's an idiot? \nHEYWARD Gold could be arranged. \nMAGUA For Munro children? \nHEYWARD Yes. \nMAGUA How much gold has the master of the Yengeese? \nHEYWARD The King? The King has mountains of gold! \nLong pause as if Magua and King George II were seriously considering this \ttransaction. \nMAGUA Not enough. \nHeyward is first realizing with whom he's playing. \nHEYWARD What is enough? \nMAGUA Heart.

Uncas slips the swung musket, but it catches his elbow. Uncas' musket falls. Before it hits the ground his tomahawk is out and hacks Four over the edge ... \nMAGUA \nrunning forward past Five, confronts Uncas head on. It's incredibly fast. \nUNCAS' \nthree tomahawk swings are dodged by Magua whose own knife streaks like silver flashes. Uncas, gashed on arms and chest, feints right and slams Magua with an open hand, closes and the men are intertwined steel and muscle ... and Magua throws Uncas. Going with him and rolling off Uncas, Magua's knife flashes into his armpit. Uncas' right arm is useless. He scrambles up. Next to the expertise of a mature warrior like Magua, Uncas' raw, young determination may not be enough. \nEXTERIOR - MEADOW - CHINGACHGOOK \nfreezes. \nEXTERIOR PROMONTORY - UNCAS \nclosing, swings.

His knife is low, about to strike. She stares at him. Her eyes are like pools of deep water, calm, open, almost beatific. It stops Magua ... \nMAGUA \ninexplicably, drops his knife hand. He's riveted by her. About him, there's a glimmer of something else. He wears a human face for this one moment. He reaches out with his other hand to offer her safety. To bring her back from the edge ... \nALICE \nlooks down at Uncas, her lover, dead on the rocks below. She turns to Magua with enigmatic calm. Her eyes seem to see into him. She steps off the edge.

Hawkeye races to reload on the run ... \nEXTERIOR PROMONTORY - MAGUA \nsees the approach of Chingachgook. \nTO CHINGACHGOOK \nHuron warriors are an irrelevance.

Chingachgook's dead. Except ... \nCHINGACHGOOK \nisn't there. He rolled and, on one knee with his back to Magua, his arm slams rearward.

She's not kidding. \nANOTHER ANGLE: HEYWARD \nhelps Alice. As he does, he stares at Cora's seperation and now her proximity to Hawkeye, who's walking on ahead, is something Heyward doesn't like. His dark thoughts are distracted by a FLASH of light and more ROLLING THUNDER. \nWIDE FROM THE FRONT - HAWKEYE \ndrops and pulls Cora to the ground. \nCORA Lightning? \nHawkeye doesn't answer as he, Chingachgook, Uncas and Heyward make their way to the top of the ridge. \nCLOSER ANGLES: CORA & ALICE \njoin them and look down upon their expectation of a secure piece of England in the wilderness, a safe harbor, a father's warm welcome. \nTHEIR POV: FORT WILLIAM HENRY \nis none of those things.

Its surface is broken by the rising mass of Chingachgook, followed by Uncas and Hawkeye. Muzzle flashes from the cannon reveal the canoe and the forms of the girls further out. Chingachgook's war club is held low. The Huron senses and turns and Hawkeye's thrown tomahawk knocks him back. Hawkeye's knife flashes in the night. Chingachgook drives the war club up, smashing a Canadien onto the debris. The second Canadien jabs bayonet at Uncas, slashing his side.

Heyward approaches Hawkeye. \nHEYWARD Any powder? \nHAWKEYE: (crossing to Cora) Only one or two loads. \nCORA \nis soaked to the bones.

The Huron do not fear English anger. \nHAWKEYE (to Sachem) Wise one, the French fathers made peace and swore to their honor not to break the friendship. Magua broke it. It is false that the French would not be friends, still, to the Huron. \nSachem reacts. \nMAGUA (laughs) It made our French father happy to never have to fight the same Yengeese again. He told me this without telling me this. \nHawkeye realizes this is true. \nHAWKEYE So the Huron are the servants of the French? To do what the French are shamed to do? \nMAGUA No. (to Sachem) Huron serve no one. The French father believes he fooled Magua because he is so proud of his cleverness, he is blind. But it is the Huron path that Magua walks down, not the French one ... Now, Les Francais, also, fear Huron. That is good. When the Huron is strong from their fear, we will make the terms of trade with Les Francais. And we will trade as the white man trades. Take land from the Abnakes; fur from the Osage, Sauk & Fox. And make the Huron great. Over other tribes. No less than the whites, as strong as the whites. \nHawkeye appears to be losing his debate with Magua. \nHAWKEYE (to Sachem) Magua would use the ways of Les Francais and the Yengeese ... \nMAGUA (to Sachem) The red man put down the bow, picked up the fire stick and became the best warrior in the forest. Yes. It is the only way. \nHAWKEYE Would the Huron make his Algonquin brothers foolish with brandy and steal his lands to sell them for gold to the white man? Would the Huron have greed for more land than a man can use? Like Francais Black Robes do? Would Huron kill tribes with disease? Would the Huron fool Seneca into taking all the animals in the forest for beads & brandy? But sell the fur to the white man for gold? ... (to Sachem) Those are the ways of Yengeese and Les Francais masters. Are they the ways of Huron men who hunt & work the land? Or of dogs? ... Magua's heart is twisted. He would make himself into what twisted him. A Dog, become Master of Dogs. But are Hurons dogs? ... Magua's way is false. It is like the white sickness. Magua's way will bring only sadness and shame. Is there another way? I don't know. (pauses) I am Nathaniel of the Yengeese; Hawkeye, adopted son of Chingachgook, of the Mohican people ... Let the children of the dead Munro go free ...

You are women. Send your arrows and guns to the Seneca, beg from them venison to eat, corn to grind. Slaves, dogs, rabbits, thieves ...

He looks at Heyward, then looks at Hawkeye and he nods his head. \nHAWKEYE \nsees this. His eyes go to Cora. They've stopped dragging her towards the fire pit. Hawkeye steps forward to surrender.

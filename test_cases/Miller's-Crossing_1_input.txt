He nods to himself. 
She's a little wild, but she's okay.  I like her. 
Tom smiles. 
Tom Yeah, you like her.  Like the Kaiser likes cabbage.  You're dizzy for her. 
Leo scowls at Tom. 
Leo What of it?  Jesus, Tom, ain't you ever been bit by that bug? 
Tom Leo, if she's such an angel, why are you looking for her at four in the morning? 
Leo digs his hands into his pockets and slouches back, profoundly embarassed. 
Leo I put a tail on her this afternoon. 
Tom Hah! 
Leo Yeah, I asked Rug Daniels to follow her around-- just, you know, just to keep her out of trouble. 
Tom And to tell you what trouble she was managing to whip up herself. 
Leo It wasn't to spy, Tom; I was worried.  After that meeting with Caspar, well--you can't be too careful. 
Tom Uh-huh.  And what did Rug tell you that has you scurrying over here? 
Leo That's just it.  Nothing.  He's disappeared. 
Tom laughs humorlessly. 
Tom So you've lost your ladyfriend and the tail you put an her. 
Leo I guess it does sound pretty sorry at that. . . 
He looks from his empty glass up to Tom. 
. . . Help me out, Tom.  I wouldn't know where to start looking.  You know Rug's crowd, you know the people Verna runs with.  I'm just worried now, with things the way they are between me and Caspar-- 
Tom gives a wave of disgust. 
Tom You shouldn't be confronting Johnny Caspar, it's what I've been trying to tell you.  You can't trade body blows with him.  He's gotten too strong. 
For the first time Leo displays some testiness: 
Leo I reckon I can still trade body blows with any man in this town. . . 
He sighs, looks back down at his drink. 
. . . Except you, Tom. 
Tom And Verna. 
Leo smiles good-naturedly. 
Leo Okay, give me the needle.  I am a sap, I deserve it. . . 
He stands and walks to the door. 
Tom doesn't move.  His eyes remain fixed on the chair Leo has just vacated. 
Leo pauses in the open doorway. 
. . . Thanks for the drink.  Let me know if you hear anything. . . 
The door closes and he is gone. 
Tom grimaces and stands up.  Sunlight is just starting to come in through the windows, defining for the first time the corners of the large semi-circular room as Tom walks across it to the bedroom.  Distant early-morning traffic noise is filtering up from the street. 
7.   INT  BEDROOM 
As Tom opens the double oak doors and enters, leaving them open. 
He crosses to the bed and sits an its edge, hunched forward, thinking.  Behind him, a woman stirs. 
Woman (sleepily) Who was that? 
Tom Leo. . . 
He takes a cigarette from the nightstand and lights it. 
. . . He's looking for you. 
Verna stiffens. 
Verna Did you tell him I was here? 
Tom No. 
Verna relaxes. 
Verna Did you put in a good word for my brother? 
Tom No. 
Verna You said you would. 
Tom . . . I said I'd think about it. 
Verna What did you tell him? 
Tom is lost in thought.  He exhales smoke. 
Tom . . . Did you see Rug Daniels last night? 
Verna No.  What did you tell Leo? 
Tom finally turns to face her.  After looking at her for a beat: 
Tom . . . I told him you were a tramp and he should dump you. 
A shoe flies past his head and hits the wall behind him. 
Verna You're a son of a bitch, Tom.

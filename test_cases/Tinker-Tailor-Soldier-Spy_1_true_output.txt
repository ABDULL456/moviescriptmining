Suddenly Irina withdraws. She stares at him. 
IRINA I know what you are. 
A long beat. Tarr waits her out. 
IRINA (CONT'D) I would like to talk to your boss Control. I have something to trade. Something big. I want a new life in the West. 
Tarr desperately tries to stay looking calm. 
IRINA (CONT'D) That is the deal. You tell them. 
103A   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - EVENING - PRESENT                  103A 
Smiley sits with his hooded, bored look, examining everything carefully. 
SMILEY What made you so sure she wasn't coat-trailing? 
RICKI TARR We've all got our strengths. And weaknesses. 
He flicks a look at the pile of Ann's letter, an insolent smile. 
RICKI TARR (CONT'D) Me, I know women. She said she had a secret. The mother of all secrets. Said she'd only tell Control. She wanted to trade. New life for her and her kids. 
SMILEY She had children in Russia? 
RICKI TARR That's why they let her and Boris out. So, I said I'd tell the Circus. 
SMILEY (Beat) But you didn't? 
Tarr's smile fades.

105   INT. ISTANBUL - TARR'S APARTMENT - DAY - PAST             105 
Irina prowls the room. 
RICKI TARR (V.O.) Wanted to find out more first. So, I waited her out. 
Tarr lounges by a window, smoking. 
RICKI TARR (CONT'D) (Shrugging) You can't expect them to jump at every offer of service.(Beat. Carefully) If they had more information... 
Irina doesn't answer, paces. Tarr lets his face harden. 
RICKI TARR (CONT'D) Well, if you won't tell me more, there's nothing I can do. 
She stares at him. 
IRINA If I tell you, I'm putting my life in your hands. The lives of my children? Do you understand? 
She walks slowly towards him, bends over, begins to whisper in his ear. 
106   INT. ISTANBUL - TARR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                    106 
The two make love, passionate, Irina trying to bind him to her. Tarr responds, excited by her, now that she needs him. We intercut their intense love-making with... 
107   INT. ISTANBUL - NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT                          107 
A drunk Boris groping a very young hostess on a dance floor, his shirt undone. He starts to strip the girl of her uniform, amused by her efforts to keep her clothes on. The two minders clap in time to the music, encouraging him. Boris grabs the girl by the hair, biting her neck, laughing, eyes glazed with drink, barely able to stand... The inane music blares on... 
108   INT. ISTANBUL - TARR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                    108 
Silence. Tarr and Irina stare at each other. A long beat. 
IRINA (tenderly) Promise me you'll be careful. No details to the Circus. Not until we're safe. 
RICKI TARR (genuine) I promise. 
109   EXT. ISTANBUL - DAY                                         109 
Tarr threads his way through the crowds of evening shoppers and tourists, holding in his head the BIGGEST SECRET of his career. There's something new on his face - AMBITION. 
110   EXT. ISTANBUL - IMPORT/EXPORT OFFICE - EVENING              110 
We're gliding above the respectable front of a Business OFFICE, through the RECEPTION - which maintains the cover story of an Import/Export outfit... 
...over a back-room and through a STEEL DOOR to the CYPHER ROOM beyond where we find a drunk TUFTY THESINGER watching Tarr send a CODED MESSAGE. 
TUFTY THESINGER You were supposed to have gone. London stations's been on to me. They want to know what the hell you're doing. 
RICKI TARR (without turning) Fuck off. 
111   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT - PRESENT                     111 
Smiley takes off his glasses and wipes them.

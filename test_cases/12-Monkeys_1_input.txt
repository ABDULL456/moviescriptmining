MICROBIOLOGIST Why don't you sit down, Mr. Cole. 
COLE goes to the empty chair at the conference table, sits down. 
ASTROPHYSICIST We want you to tell us about last night. 
COLE I went to the surface and I collected specimens like I was told. 
The SCIENTISTS don't say anything.  They just study him carefully. 
COLE (worried) I mashed the spider, didn't I? 
MICROBIOLOGIST We'll get to the spider later, Mr. Cole.  Right now, we want to know everything that you saw. 
INT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE - AN HOUR LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT) 
COLE, starting to look very tired now, stands at the blackboard sketching a detailed map of exactly where he was last night. 
ASTPOPHYSICIST Where you collected sample #4, what street was that? 
COLE Uh... 
BOTANIST It's important to observe everything. 
COLE I think it was...I'm sure it was 2nd Street. 
As the SCIENTISTS start to whisper animatedly among themselves, COLE'S eyes drift across the newspaper clippings taped to the wall.  One headline screams, "VIRUS MUTATING!"  Another features a photo of an OLD MAN (DR. MASON, who we'll see again later on) and the words, SCIENTIST SAYS, "IT'S TOO LATE FOR CURE". 
ASTROPHYSICIST'S VOICE (o.s.) Close your eyes, Cole. 
Startled, COLE closes his eyes obediently. 
BLACKNESS.  Like COLE, WE SEE NOTHING.  But we HEAR their VOICES. 
ENGINEER'S VOICE (o.s.) Tell us in detail what you've seen in this room. 
COLE'S VOICE (o.s.) Uh, in this room?  Uh... 
MICROBIOLOGIST'S VOICE (o.s.) How many of us are there? 
COLE'S VOICE (o.s.) Six...seven, if you count me. 
ASTROPHYSICIST'S VOICE (o.s.) Tell us about the pictures on the wall... 
COLE'S VOICE (o.s.) Uh, you mean the newspapers? 
A MONTAGE OF OVERLAPPING VOICES (o.s.) Tell us about the newspapers.  Can you hear my voice?  What do I look like? What does he look like, the man who just spoke?  How old were you when you left the surface? 
The VOICES blur into a cacophony and FADE INTO the droning P.A. SYSTEM at the airport. 
INT.  CONCOURSE/AIRPORT - DAY 
THE DREAM AGAIN!  But at an earlier moment.  YOUNG COLE, flanked by his PARENTS, whose faces are out of view, is watching a PLANE land through one of the big glass windows that lines the concourse leading to the departure gates. 
P.A. SYSTEM (o.s.) Flight 784 now boarding at gate... 
Suddenly, a SHOUT, followed by raised VOICES, interrupts the monotonous airport routine.  As YOUNG COLE and his PARENTS turn to see what's going on, a man we'll call MR. PONYTAIL, his face averted, hurries past them, bumping YOUNG COLE with a Chicago Hulls Sports Duffle Bag. 
MR. PONYTAIL WATCH IT! 
YOUNG COLE sees little more than the gaudy pants, the duffle, and the man's ponytail flopping as he rushes towards the gates. 
Just then, a WOMAN'S VOICE cries out, "NOOOOOOOOO!" 
YOUNG COLE turns back toward the Security Check Point just as TRAVELERS scatter madly, some diving to the floor, others running.  A TERRIFIED TRAVELER, hitting the floor close by, looks up at YOUNG COLE with panicky eyes, and asks.... TERRIFIED TRAVELER Just exactly why did you volunteer? 
INT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE/FUTURE WORLD - (ETERNAL NIGHT) 
COLE comes abruptly awake.  Seated now, he's facing the SCIENTISTS. 
ASTROPHYSICIST Wake up, Cole. 
COLE Uh, I didn't hear the... 
MICROBIOLOGIST (tapping a pencil on the table) I asked you, why did you volunteer? 
COLE Well, the guard woke me up.  He told me I volunteered. 
The SCIENTISTS react, whispering urgently among themselves. 
COLE starts to nod off again, then comes awake with a start as the ENGINEER speaks to him. 
ENGINEER We appreciate you volunteering.  You're a very good observer, Cole. 
COLE Uh, thank you. 
ENGINEER You'll get a reduction in sentence. 
COLE keeps his face impassive. 
ASTROPHYSICIST To be determined by the proper authorities. 
ENGINEER You don't want to jeopardize that reduction, do you, Cole?  Have it taken away? 
COLE No, sir!

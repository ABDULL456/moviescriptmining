GIRL I have to go. 
WALTER Do you come here often? 
IRL My daddy likes me home before dark. 
WALTER It's good to listen to your daddy. 
The girl runs off down the path. 
Walter watches after her. He stands alone in the field. 
INT. BUS - DAY 
Walter rides the bus. Through many different neighborhoods, day passes into night. He stares beyond his reflection. Over the following voice-over we cut between Walter's apartment and Walter riding the bus. 
WALTER (V.O.) I followed a girl.

WALTER (V.0.) I talked to a girl... I was near a girl... Jesus God! What did I want to happen? I 
INT. BUS - NIGHT 
The bus drives by a number of billboards, children's Gap ads... 
WALTER (V.O.) Maybe it's like Rosen said. Maybe I wanted nothing to happen. 
INT. WALTER'S APT. - NIGHT 
Walter pauses in the writing. 
WALTER (out loud) Fucking Rosen! This isn't helping. 
There's a loud KNOCK at the door. Walter looks over in surprise. The KNOCK comes again. Walter quickly closes his journal and puts it in a drawer. The KNOCK comes again. 
Walter goes to the door and opens it partially. 
ergeant Lucas stands outside. 
LUCAS Hiya, Walter. 
Walter opens the door. Lucas enters. Walter slowly closes the door behind him. 
WALTER What can I do for you, Sergeant Lucas? 
Lucas signals a chair. 
LUCAS Have a seat. 
Walter slowly sits. Lucas walks around the room. He pauses.

CONTINUED: 
LUCAS (cont'd) Too much sun. 
WALTER What? 
Lucas points to the plant on the windowsill. 
LUCAS Your ivy. Too much direct sunlight. These plants don't like a lot of sun.      W 
WALTER They grow outside, don't they? 
LUCAS Sure they do. But outside they've got trees around them. The trees shade them from the sun. Of course, the plants enrich the soil around the trees. One of nature's symbiotic relationships. 
WALTER You going to take me on a nature walk? 
LUCAS Don't be witty. (pause) Yesterday you took the number twelve bus from work, but instead of getting off at your normal stop, for some reason you stayed on. Why did you stay on the bus, Walter? 
WALTER I fell asleep. 
Lucas throws him a look. 
WALTER (cont'd) When I woke up I was confused. I got off at the wrong stop and walked home.

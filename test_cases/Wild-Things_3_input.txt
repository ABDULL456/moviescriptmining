KELLY Why do you make me hurt you?  It's like you want it or something. 
Suzie sobs, takes Kelly's hand. 
KELLY (CONT'D) God, you are scared, aren't you? 
Suzie runs her lips over Kelly's fingers, then pushes her T-shirt up, pushing Kelly's hand onto her breast. 
KELLY (CONT'D) And this is going to make you feel better, make you trust me... 
Suzie nods, tearing her T-shirt, getting both of Kelly's hands onto her breasts, then pushing at Kelly's wrists, getting her to pull at her nipples, hard... Kelly obliges... 
Suzie cries out in pain.  Kelly's hands move down to pull off Suzie's bottoms... 
ON RAY 
still at it with the video, his face impassive, watching. 
As Kelly pulls Suzie back into the jacuzzi, as the girls' hands slide round the curves of each other's hips, pulling themselves to each other, as the layers of steam rise to envelope them...

Kelly and Suzie making love in the jacuzzi. 
PULL BACK to REVEAL -- 
INT. POLICE ROOM - DAY 
Gloria, Ray, Hunter watch the tape.  Hunter's seen enough.  He slams the stop/tape. 
HUNTER Are you crazy, Ray? 
RAY You heard Kelly say "Sam."  That was Lombardo on the phone.  And you saw the girls... 
HUNTER Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible. (beat) What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick... 
RAY I don't believe I'm hearing this.  A month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse. (beat) They were acting.  They were all acting, from the beginning.  And we bought it, hook, line and sinker... And now they're home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryan's money. 
GLORIA Which she might have saved, if she hadn't set out to destroy the man's life. 
RAY (turning now on Gloria) What?  You wouldn't go after some guy you thought raped your daughter? (beat) Cone on.  She bought the same story we did... 
Ray stops as Hunter brings the palm of his hand down on the table a loud SLAP. 
HUNTER Listen, both of you.  You're not on a case.  There is no fucking case. (beat) I've had it up to here with Sandra Van Ryan.  Ray, you keep mucking around like this and you are going to have her suing us for invasion of privacy.  Get out of these people's lives. (beat) Am I getting through on this? 
Ray walks to the door, jerks it open -- 
INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 
Sam, angry, sits in the corridor with a uniformed officer. 
Hunter sees Sam, rolls his eyes. 
HUNTER Oh, Ray... no... 
RAY You think this is just about money, about us looking foolish?  Question him. You're gonna find a stone cold manipulative psychopath.  And those girls are going to wind up dead... 
Sam lunges at Ray.  The officer and Hunter restrain him.  Gloria looks on, taken aback by Ray's accusations, Sam's response. 
HUNTER Mr. Lombardo, please.  I'm sorry about this. 
SAM Give this idiot something to do.  Let him look into the Kennedy assassination. 
Ray flares, grabs Sam, shoves him against the wall, before they can be separated once again. 
SAM (CCNT'D) (to Hunter) Next time this guy drags me down here, I'll sue you.  You're goddamn lucky I didn't sue you the first time! 
Sam storms from the room, followed by Hunter.  Ray stares after them, finally he turns, looks at Gloria, collecting himself. 
RAY Guess I kind of lost it there. 
GLORIA You could say that. 
RAY Were you ever in a situation where you could see a thing coming and you didn't do what you could to stop it? 
Gloria studies Ray, clearly concerned. 
GLORIA We all have... 
RAY I mean something bad, Gloria, something bad you saw coning, and you didn't do anything, and then it happened. (off Gloria's silence) I did that once.  I don't want to do it again. 
EXT. MALL ENTRANCE - LATE AFTERNOON 
Sam EXXTS a building, a large package of wrapped goods beneath his arm.  He looks toward the parking lot where -- 
Barbara Baxter stands beside the red Mercedes.  She tips a valet then starts toward the mall.  She sees San.  Their eyes meet.  A moment of hesitation, as neither is quite sure what to say. 
SAM You look pretty.

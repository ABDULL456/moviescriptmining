EXT. BANGKOK STREETS - DAY 
Chang stops in his tracks. It's as if he can feel the shotgun blast in his heart. He knows what's just happened... He stands still. He closes his eyes as if he had only to wish to make it all go away... He opens them again to see... The street is completely deserted. Chang stands alone in the middle of a ghost town.

INT. CHANG'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Julian takes off his helmet that's covered in blood, throws it onto the floor and walks toward the front door. 
CHARLIE LING Wait... Julian turns back. Charlie Ling nods towards Kanita's room. 
CHARLIE LING (CONT'D) The kid. Julian shakes his head. 
JULIAN No way. 
CHARLIE LING 
SHE SAID-- 
JULIAN Who said? Beat. 
JULIAN (CONT'D) My mother? Charlie Ling nods. 
JULIAN (CONT'D) What kind of a mother says that? 
CHARLIE LING If you've got a problem, talk to her. 
JULIAN No. We're not doing it. 
CHARLIE LING You don't have to. I will. Charlie Ling kicks open the door. Julian realises he can't let him do it. And as Charlie Ling sees Kanita... Julian shoots him in the back. Charlie Ling slumps to the floor. Julian approaches the doorway. He looks in. Sees Kanita sitting on her bed. She stares at Julian, Charlie Ling's dead body at his feet. They hold each other's gaze... and then Julian slowly bows his head and leaves...

CUT TO: 
EXT. BANGKOK STREETS - DAY 
Julian stumbles out of the apartment, desperately catching his breath. He ends up leaning on a stall - similar to the one he knocked over outside Choi Yan Lee's kiosk. Candles and incense. Buddha's smiling back at him... Julian looks around him and again everything seems intense and incredibly vibrant... A group of school children, all of whom are Downs Syndrome, are crossing the road. Smiles plastered across their faces... Julian stares at them... Their presence seems to have a calming effect on him, as if they're giving him new energy to do what he's starting to realize he has to do next.

With every line, the crowd goes insane. (NOTE: Actual Young Dre Rap to Come.) As Young Dre flows, Brad is visibly shaken, but tries to play it off -- not so discreetly scribbling notes on his hand and up his arm. Young Dre finishes with devastating blow, dropping the mic on the stage. The crowd goes wild... MC Whooo... GOD DAMN! Now, let's see if this Eminem melts in yo ass and in your hand. (CONTINUED)

Brad tries to regain his composure... BRAD Can we start again?   I lost my place. TAUNTS and LAUGHS as the beat plays again. Brad wags his head, ready to come in strong. He looks down at his notes... He's sweating so badly his arm is a mess of runny ink. He freezes again... The crowd is really on him now -- collectively making the "choke" sign. BRAD I'm cool... I'm cool. Brad finally starts up. BRAD 'You big and rough, You act all tough, I bet in your childhood You never had much love.

Brad's landing causes the lid to SLAM violently shut, and forces Sean and PJ, who've been hiding behind it, to pop up. SEAN What was that? A RUMBLE comes from the dumpster and they pull back the lid. ANGLE ON: Inside the dumpster where Brad lies in the bottom -- his fall was broken by several loaves of old Wonder Bread. PJ and Sean fall into hysterics, as Shondra emerges from the club. She finds PJ and Sean apoplectic with laughter, shakes her head and begins to help Brad out of the dumpster.

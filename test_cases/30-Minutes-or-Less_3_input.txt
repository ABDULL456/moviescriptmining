Will grudgingly stands up. 
WILL I guess that's just the difference between you and me. 
He holds up the Lethal Weapon DVDs. 
WILL I'm like Riggs. Cruising the streets. No rules, no attachments. Every other day some asshole is trying to take my badge. You're fucking Murtaugh. Always worried about your pension. Well, guess what, it gets old after the first movie. 
CHET I just got head. I'm totally Riggs. Will shakes his head, turns and walks off. INT. STUDIO APARTMENT - DAY Will wakes up, legs dangling over the edge of a tiny couch. His TV is still on, displaying the menu screen from a porn. Will looks down at his coffee table. Clears some magazines to reveal a file folder. Flips the cover - It's full of college applications, drafts of admissions essays, a junior college transcript. Will thumbs through one of the glossy applications. The kids look young. Very young. Will glances over at a picture on his wall: he and Chet at high school graduation, looking just as young. They have their arms around a pretty girl squeezed between them. Will and the girl look very high and very happy. Will shuts the folder, slides it back under the coffee table debris. He looks over at a clock: it is already 2:00 PM. WILL Fuck. INT. MUSTANG - DAY Will jumps in and starts the engine. As he tucks his "Giorgio's" cap onto his head, he catches his reflection in the rear-view mirror. 
WILL You asshole. You titanic asshole. Come on down and get your prize. 
He makes his fingers into a gun, puts it to his head...pulls the trigger and 
BOOM! 
WE'RE IN 
EXT. OPEN FIELD - DAY 
A watermelon explodes in a shower of red, juicy bits. Loud, dumb laughter echoes. 
Standing 20 yards away is DWAYNE (32), an intense, meaty guy in a sleeveless Baltimore Ravens t-shirt. On his left bicep is a tattoo of the Tasmanian Devil flipping the bird. 
DWAYNE Fruit motherfuckin' salad! 
Crouched beside him is JAY (27), tall and awkward, in a wool surplus cap. He carefully rigs homemade explosives to another watermelon, then looks up at Dwayne. His eyes are magnified into saucers by his thick glasses. There's a peculiar eagerness to please in them. 
JAY This one's gonna blow even bigger. 
DWAYNE Boy, if you weren't such a skinny little bitch you coulda been in the military or something. 
JAY Whatever. I don't need the military. I taught myself how to do this shit. 
DWAYNE I hear that. I taught myself how to eat pussy. And cut my own hair. 
Jay jogs the watermelon a safe distance away. He returns and pulls out a detonator. Dwayne snatches it. 
DWAYNE This one's all me. (makes "radio" sounds) Mr. President, we have enemies at the gate. Give me the order. (more "radio" sounds) Fuck that, sir. I don't negotiate with terrorists! 
Dwayne presses a button and 
BOOM! 
The explosion is so powerful that it sprinkles our guys' smiling faces with fruit juice. 
INT. KITCHEN, NICE HOUSE - DAY 
Large and early-90s chic. Dwayne and Jay have the fridge open, fixing themselves a cold cut plate. Dwayne is debating the amount of meat on the plate...adds some more. 
DWAYNE Wanna make sure I get enough calories. 
JAY I thought you wanted to get diesel for the summer. Bang that towel girl at the community pool. 
DWAYNE It's obvious you don't know shit-all about physical fitness. You gotta bulk up first, then you slim down. I'm clearly in the bulk up phase. I told you to watch Pumping Iron like a month ago. If you'd listened to me, maybe you'd know what the fuck I'm talking about. (BEAT) Grab some RC Cola. 
INT. LIVING ROOM, NICE HOUSE - DAY 
The shades are drawn. We hear a girl scream bloody murder! 
The guys are watching FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 3...in 3D. They both wear cheap cardboard glasses. 
Jay jumps back as Jason wields a 3D ax. 
JAY Shit, man! It's so real! 
Dwayne reaches out, "touching" the 3D images. He stands and starts humping the air. 
DWAYNE Check it out. I ain't afraid of Jason. I'm fucking him. (THRUSTING HARDER) You like that, Jason!? In the mask! 
Jay cracks up. The lights flick on. 
GRIZZLED VOICE (O.S.) Who are you two fags fucking? 
Standing by the switch is Dwayne's dad, JERRY (70s). Most people just call him "THE MAJOR." The faded USMC tattoo on his thick forearm explains why. 
JAY Afternoon, Major. 
Dwayne flops back onto the couch.

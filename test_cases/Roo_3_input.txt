She folds them across Jack's chest, elbows sticking out.

MA (O.S.) (CONT'D) There, Now push up your arms. 
JACK I can't. 
MA Push, Jack. 
His elbows scrape through and his fingers clasp hers. 
MA (CONT'D) Now roll. 
Jack makes a feeble try, barely moves. Pants, sobs. 
MA (CONT'D) OK. Take a breath. 
JACK Get me out. 
MA (O.S.) You're getting yourself out. 
JACK Out! 
MA (O.S.) If you panic, Old Nick will hear that you're alive, and he'll be mad. 
Jack groans. 
MA (O.S.) (CONT'D) I know you, Jack. I know you can do this. 
Jack clenches his teeth and starts to writhe and roll side to side. 
He rolls over face down, and gets his butt slightly in the air, bending the cylinder of the rug. 
He rolls the other way, sits up: the rug opens. He claws his way out, his face red and smeared. Ma is looking almost as distraught as him, but she grins. 
MA (CONT'D) You did it! You're the banana!

JACK I hate you. 
The first time he's ever said it: they're both shocked. 
MA That's OK. I brought you here to Room. I didn't mean to but I did, and I've always been so glad. And now it's my job to get you out.

Later. Jack's lying half rolled in the rug. He's been waiting for hours. Ma crouches beside him drilling him in the plan. 
JACK Truck, wriggle out, Jump, Run - 
MA Wait till the truck slows down at the first stop sign - if you jump when it's going fast you might - 
She stops talking so as not to cry. Checks her watch. Stares at the door as if she can will it to open. 
MA (CONT'D) So Truck, Wriggle Out, Jump when it Slows Down... 
Jack struggles to remember the list. 
JACK Somebody, Run - MA Jump, Run, then shout to Somebody and show them the Note. 
Jack checks the for note in his pocket. 
MA (CONT'D) Tell them your Ma is Joy Newsome and Â­

JACK Who is Somebody? 
MA Anybody - the first person you see. 
JACK An actual real person. 
Ma nods, worried by his lingering confusion. 
JACK (CONT'D) What if Old Nick unwraps me? 
MA He's not going to - 
Ma falters, puts her head in her hands. She collects herself. 
MA (CONT'D) You got Bad Tooth in your pocket? 
Jack points to his cheek. 
JACK It's in here so I don't lose it. 
Beat 
MA You're going to love it. 
JACK What?

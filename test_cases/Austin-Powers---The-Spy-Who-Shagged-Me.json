{"test1_input": "AUSTIN Wait, I can explain, man! I was going to shag her but the article was so fascinating-- \nBASIL EXPOSITION I'm sorry, Austin, I'm afraid it's true: you've lost your mojo. \nBasil shows Austin the mojometer, which reads EMPTY. \nAUSTIN (crushed) Without my mojo, I'm useless to the Ministry and to Her Majesty.  I think it's time to retire. \nBASIL EXPOSITION I'm afraid that's not possible, Austin. You see, Dr. Evil has returned. \nAUSTIN Again? \nBASIL EXPOSITION Again. \nINT. MOD - TIME-TRAVEL ROOM \nAustin and Basil ride on the back of a golf cart through the largest room you've ever seen in your life. \nBASIL EXPOSITION We have evidence that Dr. Evil has developed a time machine. \nBasil shows Austin altered photos of Dr. Evil with famous villains, such as Sadam, Nixon, and Donald Trump. \nBASIL EXPOSITION Our researcher noticed that these photos from the archives have changed. That means Dr. Evil is traveling back in time and creating alliances with each decade's most despised villains. \nAustin tries to read them and gets queasy. \nAUSTIN I can't read in the car. I get a bit vomy. \nAustin burps and swallows it. \nAUSTIN Got it. I almost gipped. \nBASIL EXPOSITION (V.O.) Our data indicates that Dr. Evil is in the year 1969. Luckily, we also have a time travel device. After years of research we've developed a machine that will transport you back to the Sixties. \nA bright overhead light comes on spotlighting a brand new VOLKSWAGEN BEETLE CONVERTIBLE, painted up psychedelic by Peter Max. \nAUSTIN But Basil, isn't that the new Volkswagen Beetle? \nBASIL EXPOSITION That's what they'd like you to believe. \nAUSTIN So, Basil, if I travel back to 1969 and I was frozen in 1967, I could go look at my frozen self. But, if I'm still frozen in 1967, how could I have been unthawed in the 90's and traveled back to the Sixties? (goes cross-eyed) Oh, no, I've gone cross-eyed. \nBASIL EXPOSITION (to camera) I suggest you don't worry about those things and just enjoy yourself. \nAustin gets into the car and turns it on. \nAUSTIN This is smashing Basil. I'll go back to the Sixties, recharge my mojo, defeat Dr. Evil and be back in time for tea. \nBASIL EXPOSITION Good luck, Austin. \nAUSTIN Luck has nothing to do with it, Basil. \nAustin steps on the gas. The car lurches in reverse and smashes some equipment. \nAUSTIN Sorry. (changing gears) Swinging Sixties, here I come, baby, yeah! \nThe car takes off, heading for the wall. It DISAPPEARS, leaving flaming tread marks. \nFLASH CUT TO: \nEXT. STREET - LONDON - \nThe Beetle time machine appears out of nowhere and screeches to a stop. A London HIPPIE smoking a hukka watches. He throws the hukka down. Austin hops out. \nAUSTIN I feel better already, man! \nAustin smiles and we see that his teeth are back to being TERRIBLE. He walks off as a crowd gathers around the car. \nEXT. PARK - LONDON \n", "test1_true": "PULL BACK FURTHER to reveal a beautiful MYSTERIOUS WOMAN watching both of them. From this distance we can't tell who she is. \nA sign reads \"BE-IN FOR PEACE\". HIPPIES, MODS, and FREAKS of all descriptions dance to the music of a PSYCHEDELIC BAND. The band's name is on the drum kit: \"MING TEA.\" \nAUSTIN Alright, baby, a swinging shin-dig! \nAustin gets into the dancing, quickly becoming the center of the scene. The lead singer of the band invites him on stage and hands him the microphone as the band starts a new song: \"SEXUAL REVOLUTION.\" \nAustin begins singing and a choreographed musical number begins involving the outdoor crowd a la Bob Fosse's Sweet Charity or Hair. \nAUSTIN (singing) 'THERE'S A SEXUAL REVOLUTION, YOU CAN FEEL IT IN THE AIR.  PEOPLE SHAGGING JUST LIKE WEASELS AND THEY JUST DON'T SEEM TO CARE. \nHip-thrusting young MOD FREAKS Fosse-hump rhythmically. \nAUSTIN (singing) HEY, WATCH OUT SQUARES...  YOU MAKES US BORED!  THE PENIS IS MIGHTIER THAN THE SWORD \nAustin does various groovy dance moves like THE ROCK 'EM SOCK 'EM ROBOT and THE HEAVYWEIGHT. \nAUSTIN (singing) THERE'S A SEXUAL REVOLUTION AND YOU AIN'T SEEN NOTHING YET PEOPLE SHAGGING IN THE CLUBS AND INSIDE A JUMBO JET \nForty Austins appear in a KALEIDOSCOPE EFFECT. \nAUSTIN (singing) HEY SQUARE WORLD THE END IS NIGH. WHEN WE SAY HUMP YOU SAY 'HOW HIGH?' \nThree GROOVY CHICKS behind Austin suddenly have tambourines for the big finale. The assassin and the mysterious woman are both in the audience, keeping an eye on Austin. All we see of the woman are shots of her BOOTS, CLOTHES, and a FEMALE SYMBOL MEDALLION. \nAUSTIN (singing) SO GO MAKE LOVE OR MASTURBATE-- SEXUAL FREEDOM WILL NEVER BE OUT OF DAAAAAAAAAAATE! \nAustin holds the note an improbably long time, arms outstretched. \nThe dancers crouch-walk towards the camera. \nEVERYONE (chanting) FREE-- LOVE! (louder) FREE-- LOVE! (louder) FREE-- LOVE! (shouting) IT'S THE SIXTIES! \nThe SONG ENDS and all the dancers end up on one knee with their arms outstretched, panting. Austin breathes heavily and smiles smugly like Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance. \nWe are TIGHT ON Austin's ass. PULL BACK to see that it is the MYSTERIOUS WOMAN who is watching Austin's ass. She SMILES behind the binoculars hiding her face. \n37 EXT. CARNABY ST. \nAustin walks down the street looking at his new BEATLES ALBUM. \nSitting in a parked Citroen watching him is the ASSASSIN. \nThe Aryan assassin nods to a SHOE-SHINE on the street. \nThe shoe-shine boy nods to a BUSINESS MAN in a Homburg. \nThe business man nods to a BOBBY. \nThe bobby nods to a WOMAN WITH A BABY CARRIAGE. \nThe woman with a baby carriage nods to a MIME. \nThe mime nods to a BLIND BEGGAR with a tin cup. \nThe blind beggar nods to a CARPENTER on a roof. \nThe carpenter FLASHES A LIGHT to an INDIAN CHIEF. \nThe Indian Chief gives a SMOKE SIGNAL to a TELEGRAPH OPERATOR. \nThe telegraph operator sends a signal to the BEEFEATER GUARD. \nThe Beefeater salutes with his pike to a SEXY TICKET COLLECTOR on a double-decker bus. \nThe sexy ticket collector signals a TAXI DRIVER. \n", "test1_id": 2337, "test2_input": "The taxi driver nods back to the assassin as he drives by. \nINT. CITROEN \nThe assassin gets the signal and starts the car. The whole nodding sequence was a circular waste of time. \nEXT. STREET - VARIOUS ANGLES \nAustin walks along. Suddenly, he sees the Citroen coming at him.  He dives out of the way and takes off running. He rounds a corner and pretends to be a COUPLE MAKING OUT against a wall by hugging himself. \nThe assassin sees him and slams on the brakes. He raises his gun. \nAustin turns as he hears a car HONK. \nIt's Austin's BEETLE CONVERTIBLE. The mysterious woman steps out. \nWe see her in her entirety for the first time, and what a sight it is. She has long auburn hair and wears a tight racing suit, unzipped just enough to show the female symbol medallion. \nShe is FELICITY SHAGWELL. \nMUSIC: FELICITY'S THEME \nFELICITY Care for a ride? \nAUSTIN That's my Beetle, baby. \nFELICITY It was your Beetle.

BEETLE \nFelicity turns around to look. \nFELICITY Grab the wheel, would you? \nAustin grabs the wheel and Felicity pulls a gun. She turns and FIRES out the window. \nEXT. ROAD \nThe assassin's tire BLOWS. The car skids towards a Cliff and he jumps out as it goes over. \nEXT. CLIFF SEEN FROM THE OCEAN \nThe car goes over and tumbles down the cliff, bouncing three times before it EXPLODES. \nEXT. CLIFF \nThe assassin hangs on to a branch with one hand. He falls. \nASSASSIN Ahhhhhhhh! \n", "test2_true": "Same shot as the car: The assassin's body goes over and tumbles down the cliff, bouncing three times before it, too, EXPLODES. \nFELICITY Well, Austin, I think this time you may have met your match. \nAUSTIN Oh, I've beaten Dr. Evil before, and I'll beat him again. \nFELICITY I was talking about me. \nShe smiles, turns, and walks away. \nINT. AUSTIN'S PAD \nThe room is dark, with only a single spotlight providing illumination. Suddenly, Austin and Felicity rise on an elevator into the middle of the spotlight. \nAUSTIN Welcome to my shag pad, baby. \nLight floods the pad, revealing hanging basket chairs, Hi- fi, and Warhol silk screens of Austin. \nAustin blows DUST off a table. \nAUSTIN Care for something to drink? \nAustin hits a button and a bookcase revolves to reveal a wetbar. \nAUSTIN Or perhaps something to read? \nAustin walks seductively over to the real wetbar and hits a button. It revolves to reveal a bookcase. \nAUSTIN How about a hot cup of coffee? \nFELICITY Yes, I rather fancy a grind. \nAUSTIN Oh, Behave! \nAustin hits a button and an automatic coffee-pourer pours a cup. \nMUSIC: Girl from Impenema by JOBIM \nAUSTIN Would you like a... mas-sage? A sensssual mas-sage? \nAustin hits a button and a series of actions take place: the floor opens up to reveal a sunken bed; red gels slide into place over the lamps; a painting slides back to reveal a reel-to-reel; an end table revolves to reveal a selection of massage oils. \nFelicity lies on her stomach. Austin begins to massage her. \nAUSTIN How does that feel, baby? \nFELICITY Mmm, lower. \nAUSTIN (lowering his voice) HOW DOES THAT FEEL, BABY? \nThey laugh. Austin continues to massage her. \nFELICITY Wait, something's itching me. \nShe reaches behind her and unties the strap of her evening dress, revealing her naked back. \nFELICITY That's better. \nAUSTIN Crikey!!! \nAustin GULPS and accidentally spurts way too much oil on her. \nAUSTIN Sorry. \nAustin continues the back rub and Felicity stretches out on the bed. \nAUSTIN (talking to his crotch) Hello, anyone home?

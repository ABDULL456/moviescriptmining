Austin foiled Dr. Evil's plan to send a nuclear warhead to the center of the earth and banished him into space forever. Or so he thought. \nEXT. HOTEL - NIGHT (ESTABLISHING SHOT FROM FIRST MOVIE) \nSUPER: THE FRENCH RIVIERA \nINT. HOTEL - HALLWAY \nElegant double doors with a brass plaque reading \"Honeymoon Suite.\" A \"Do Not-Disturb\" sign hangs from the handle. \nINT. HOTEL SUITE \nFROM THE FIRST MOVIE: Austin and Vanessa snuggle in bed. She plays with his chest hair. \nVANESSA I love you, Mr. Powers. \nAUSTIN And I love you, Mrs. Powers. \nSHOT TO MATCH EXISTING FOOTAGE: Austin gets out of bed. We see Vanessa putting on her robe from behind, and then EXISTING FOOTAGE: Austin and Vanessa kiss. \nVANESSA Let's go out on the terrace. It's a beautiful night, we can look at the stars. \nEXT. HOTEL BALCONY \nEXISTING FOOTAGE: Austin and Vanessa gaze at the stars. \nAUSTIN Look how beautiful the night sky is. \nVANESSA Isn't that the big dipper? \nAUSTIN Yeah, and that looks just like Uranus. \nVANESSA Austin! \nAUSTIN (sheepish) Well, you know. \nVANESSA Hey, I've never seen that big star before. \nAUSTIN Yeah, what is that? \nAustin pulls out his telescope and takes a look. \nAUSTIN'S POV - TELESCOPE EFFECT \nEXT. SPACE \nEXISTING SHOT: The Bob's Big Boy rocket. \nINT. DR. EVIL'S CAPSULE \nDR. EVIL This isn't over yet, Mr. Powers. I have one more trick up my sleeve, don't I Mr. Bigglesworth? \nThe frozen Mr. Bigglesworth MEOWS. \nEXT. SPACE \nThe Bob's Big Boy rocket. Suddenly, a hatch opens in Bob's rear end and Dr. Evil's silver egg capsule poops out. \nSFX: PLOOP! \nCREDIT APPEARS MOVING LEFT TO RIGHT Blocking his penis lengthwise as he walks. \nNUDE BEACH - CREDIT SEQUENCE \nA girl sits on a blanket; a HORIZONTAL CREDIT blocks her bare chest. Austin lays on his back beside her, trying to be suave; A VERTICAL CREDIT appears. \nThe wind blows away a kite, revealing a stark-naked girl. The credit \"PRODUCTION DESIGN\" blocks her chest; the credit \"BY\" blocks her you-know-what. Austin walks into frame; the \"PRODUCTION DESIGNER'S NAME\" disguises his growing interest. \nAustin joins a nude volleyball game in progress. CREDITS appear everywhere to block all possible combinations of nudity. People leap in all directions to make saves, causing CREDITS TO APPEAR at crazy angles. \nA pretty girl watches Austin lift weights. Her boobs are blocked by the \"WRITTEN BY\" credit. \nAustin lifts a dumbbell. The credit \"MIKE MYERS\" sticks out from his waist. Austin looks proud. \nA BUFF NAKED BODYBUILDER joins them. He lifts a much heavier weight. A much longer credit sticks out from his waist: \"AND MICHAEL MCCULLERS\". Austin pouts. \nAustin runs down the beach, his bum blocked by the credit \"DIRECTED BY\". He jumps on a trampoline and does the splits in mid-air: \nFREEZE FRAME AND PAN AROUND LIKE IN THE GAP \"KHAKI SWING\" AD.  Austin smiles crazily, his penis blocked by \"JAY ROACH.\" \nAustin does a super-duper double flip into his JAGUAR. \nAUSTIN Shaguar, baby, yeah! \nCU on the chrome script on the grill: it reads \"Shaguar\" where it would normally read \"Jaguar\". \nThe car speeds off. \nFULL SCREEN TV JERRY SPRINGER SHOW \nOn the stage we see a Klansman father and his Klansman son, a Nazi father and his Nazi son, and SCOTT EVIL all seated on a panel. \nLower Third Chyron: \"MY FATHER IS EVIL AND WANTS TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD\"  JERRY SPRINGER \nIf you just joined us, today's topic is \"my father is evil and wants to take over the world\". Now, Bobby, you had something you wanted to share with your father before the break. \nBOBBY Dad, I know you're against race mixing and all that, but I met someone... \nKLANSMAN Don't say it! \nThe crowd WHOOPS. \nBOBBY I met someone... and he's black. \nThe crowd goes crazy. \nKLANSMAN He? \nThe Klansman holds his hooded head in his hands. \nJERRY SPRINGER Please welcome Tim. \nA handsome Blair Underwood look-alike enters and hugs the Klansman's son. The crowd screams. \nJERRY MOVES TO SCOTT EVIL. \nJERRY SPRINGER Now Scott, tell us about your father. Share with us. \nSCOTT Well he's the head of an evil organization that has aspirations for world domination. \nJERRY SPRINGER And where is your father right now? \nSCOTT He's in outer space, like frozen in a giant egg and stuffed inside a Big Boy rocket with his cat, Mr. Bigglesworth. \nJERRY SPRINGER Really? Well, we have a surprise for you, Scott. Let's bring out \nSCOTT'S father, Dr Evil. \nDr Evil enters. \nINT. STARBUCKS WORLD HEADQUARTERS \nNumber Two smiles weakly, breaking into a sweat on his brow. \nNUMBER TWO May I add, I appreciate you reinstating me after our little... misunderstanding. \nDR. EVIL Frau Farbissina. Wie gehts is einen? \nWe see Frau. She looks a little more 'masculine' than before. \nFRAU Zehr gut, Herr Doctor. \nDR. EVIL How are things? \nFRAU I have come to embrace the love that dare not speak it's name. To my right is my lover. \nWe see a severe-looking German woman with one continuous eyebrow. \nFRAU Her name is Unibrau. I met her on the LPGA Tour. \nDR. EVIL Right on. Welcome, Unibrau. \nDr. Evil takes another sip of cappuccino, making the frothy milk mustache even larger. \nFRAU Doctor, you have a 'milk mustache.' \nDR. EVIL (wiping it off, embarrassed) Oh, I know. I know. \nNUMBER TWO Dr. Evil, I'd like to introduce the Greek assassin, Oedipus. \nWe see a swarthy Greek army guy. \nDR. EVIL Welcome to my private army, Oedipus. Excited? \nOEDIPUS I could give a shit. \nDR. EVIL Kiss your mother with that mouth? \nOEDIPUS Yes. \nDR. EVIL Of course you do. \nDr Evil begins to press a button labelled \"Oedipus\" on his control panel, but Number Two interrupts. \nNUMBER TWO (clearing throat) Dr. Evil, as you know, the rate at which you liquidate henchmen far exceeds our ability to replace them. \nDR. EVIL I have so few pleasures left to me, Number Two. The key to life is to rotate your vices. One day it's executions, another day it's creamy French cheese.  It's like frickin' heroin. \nNUMBER TWO Well, Dr. Evil, perhaps I have the answer. While you were frozen, we began a program to clone you. \nDR. EVIL Cool. \nNUMBER TWO We had a few glitches, but I think you'll be pleased with the results. \nFRAU (shouting) Send in the clone! \nMUSIC: dramatic sting We see the shadow of an approaching figure. The shadow looks like Dr. Evil, only much larger and scarier. \nNUMBER TWO He is identical to you in every way, except he is one-eighth your size. \nWe see that the source of the shadow is a MINIATURE DR. EVIL, just like the creepy mini-Marlon Brando in The Island of Dr. Moreau. He mimics Dr. Evil's mannerisms including holding his tiny pinky to his tiny mouth. \nDR. EVIL Breathtaking. I shall call him Mini- Me. (to clone) Mini-Me, you will sit to my right. \nMini-Me sits down in a miniature version of Dr. Evil's command chair. \nDR. EVIL Come Mr. Bigglesworth! \nThe bald Mr. Bigglesworth runs and jumps into Dr. Evil's lap. A bald MR. BIGGLESWORTH KITTEN jumps into Mini-Me's lap. \nAs Dr. Evil walks to the center of the room, chairs rise from the floor. Everyone takes a seat, but Dr. Evil gets caught in the middle as chairs rise around him. He is frightened. One of the rising chairs hits him in the crotch. \nDR. EVIL OK, people, we now officially have a chair problem. If another one of these chairs hits me in the nuts, I'm gonna go postal. Mini-Me, I want you to meet Number Two. \nNUMBER TWO Hello there. \nMini-me says nothing. \nDR. EVIL Mini-Me? \nMini-me still says nothing. \nDR. EVIL Shy. Low blood sugar. (to room) Gentlemen, Phase Two is beginning. I have an operative inside the Ministry of Defense. By this time tomorrow, Austin Powers' mojo will be mine. \nDr. Evil goes over and looks out the large window. \nDR. EVIL (maniacal laugh) Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha! \nEXT. DR. EVIL'S TROPICAL ISLAND - \nWe cut outside to see that window is in fact the left eye of a Mt. Rushmore-type depiction of Dr. Evil carved into the side of a volcano on a tropical island. \nDR. EVIL (V.O.) (maniacal laugh) Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha! \nINT. MOD - CRYOGENIC FREEZING ROOM - \nWe see Austin's FROZEN BODY in cryogenic storage. Above it, we see two digital clocks. One reads: \nCURRENT DATE: MAY 25, 1969, the other reads: DATE FROZEN: NOVEMBER 11, 1967. One of the SCOTS GUARDS, is an IMMENSELY FAT SCOTTISH SOLDIER (played by Mike Myers). \nBRITISH COLONEL We've had reports that there's a spy in the Ministry of Defense.  The contents of this room are vital to the country. Be on special alert. \nFAT SOLDIER (thick Scottish accent) Those bastards will have to kill me before I let anything happen to this wee naked hairy popsicle, sir! \nBRITISH COLONEL Very good. And try and lose some weight for God's sake! \nThey exchange salutes and the Colonel exits. \nFAT SOLDIER Yessir! (sotto after the Colonel) I outta smash your teeth out with a Toffee Hammer Mr. English Colonel Telling-Me-What-To-Do-And-Stealing- our-Oil-Refusing-To-Recognize- our- Scottish-Independence! \nThe Fat Soldier begins to play the BAGPIPES, a white vapor comes out of them, filling the room. \nThe other soldiers COLLAPSE, unconscious. \nHe bores through the ice and pulls out a Sixties high-tech syringe type device with an LED graph on the side. He places it in Austin's navel. The LED meter goes from red to green, indicating FULL MOJO. \nEXT./INT. AUSTIN'S SHAGUAR - DRIVING - DAY \nAustin drives in MODERN TRAFFIC. He is drinking a STARBUCKS COFFEE and listening to the Jag's in-dash CD PLAYER. Suddenly Austin DROOPS. The car starts to sputter. The fuel gauge reads empty. \nAUSTIN Gor blimey, I'm on empty! That's funny, I just filled the Shaguar up this morning. \nAustin hits a button on the dashboard. \nBASIL EXPOSITION appears on the picture phone in the dash. \nBASIL EXPOSITION (on picture phone) Hello, I'm Basil Exposition, head of British Intelligence. \nAUSTIN You always are, Basil. Listen, the weirdest thing just happened, I've run out of petrol. \nBASIL EXPOSITION We'll send a man around immediately. How was your honeymoon? \nAUSTIN Vanessa tried to kill me, Basil. She was a Fembot! \nBASIL EXPOSITION Ah women, who can understand them? Moving on, let's discuss your new case. \nAUSTIN New case? Very shagadelic, Basil! \nBASIL EXPOSITION You'll be doing a photo shoot. We know that one of the models is an ex- KGB agent selling top secret material to the highest bidder. \nAUSTIN And... done! I'm spent! \nAustin throws his camera to Reg, who catches it. \nREG Hel-lo, you forgot about Ivana. \nAUSTIN I didn't forget, baby. Miss Humpalot and I are going to have a 'private session'. \nReg shows the girls out as they PROTEST. Austin and Ivana are left alone. Austin CLAPS TWICE and the lights dim. He CLAPS again and the fire goes up. \nMUSIC: I'm Never Going To Fall in Love Again by BURT BACHARACH \nIVANA When did you get \"The Clapper\"? \nAUSTIN November, 1964, Dutch East Indies, shore leave. \nIVANA Are you cold, Mr. Powers? \nAUSTIN I once had a bad experience with frostbite. I had to dip my tadger into a brandy snifter. \nIvana moves over to a chessboard set up nearby. \nIVANA Do you know how we keep warm in Russia? \nAUSTIN I can guess, baby. \nIVANA We play chess. \nAUSTIN I guessed wrong. \nIVANA It takes a keen intelligence to play chess. Of course, you know what they say about men with big brains, don't you? \nAUSTIN They wear large hats? \nIVANA No, they make better lovers. \nAUSTIN Wrong again. \nIvana starts playing with the chess pieces sexily (like in The Thomas Crowne Affair). \nIVANA I assume you know how to play. \nShe runs the bishop across her lips sexily. \nAUSTIN Of course.  The... horsey... moves in an L shape. \nAustin tries to match her sexy moves and CHOKES on a piece. \nAUSTIN Let's stop playing games with each other... especially difficult ones. May I ask you a question, Miss Humpalot? \nIVANA Of course. \nAUSTIN Do I make you horny? Do I? \nAustin rolls around on the polar bear rug. \nIVANA I'll tell you anything you want to know, just make love to me. \nShe pulls his shirt off, revealing his prodigious chest hair. \nIVANA You are hairy, like an animal! \nAUSTIN (growling and barking) Grrrr, baby. \nAustin takes the head of the bear skin rug. \nAUSTIN Grrrr. Ruf! Ruf! (covers the bear's eyes) Wait a tick, I don't want him watching me while I'm on the job! \nIVANA Make love to me, monkey man. \nAUSTIN Wait, I can explain, man! I was going to shag her but the article was so fascinating-- \nBASIL EXPOSITION I'm sorry, Austin, I'm afraid it's true: you've lost your mojo. \nBasil shows Austin the mojometer, which reads EMPTY. \nAUSTIN (crushed) Without my mojo, I'm useless to the Ministry and to Her Majesty.  I think it's time to retire. \nBASIL EXPOSITION I'm afraid that's not possible, Austin. You see, Dr. Evil has returned. \nAUSTIN Again? \nBASIL EXPOSITION Again. \nINT. MOD - TIME-TRAVEL ROOM \nAustin and Basil ride on the back of a golf cart through the largest room you've ever seen in your life. \nBASIL EXPOSITION We have evidence that Dr. Evil has developed a time machine. \nBasil shows Austin altered photos of Dr. Evil with famous villains, such as Sadam, Nixon, and Donald Trump. \nBASIL EXPOSITION Our researcher noticed that these photos from the archives have changed. That means Dr. Evil is traveling back in time and creating alliances with each decade's most despised villains. \nAustin tries to read them and gets queasy. \nAUSTIN I can't read in the car. I get a bit vomy. \nAustin burps and swallows it. \nAUSTIN Got it. I almost gipped. \nBASIL EXPOSITION (V.O.) Our data indicates that Dr. Evil is in the year 1969. Luckily, we also have a time travel device. After years of research we've developed a machine that will transport you back to the Sixties. \nA bright overhead light comes on spotlighting a brand new VOLKSWAGEN BEETLE CONVERTIBLE, painted up psychedelic by Peter Max. \nAUSTIN But Basil, isn't that the new Volkswagen Beetle? \nBASIL EXPOSITION That's what they'd like you to believe. \nAUSTIN So, Basil, if I travel back to 1969 and I was frozen in 1967, I could go look at my frozen self. But, if I'm still frozen in 1967, how could I have been unthawed in the 90's and traveled back to the Sixties? (goes cross-eyed) Oh, no, I've gone cross-eyed. \nBASIL EXPOSITION (to camera) I suggest you don't worry about those things and just enjoy yourself. \nAustin gets into the car and turns it on. \nAUSTIN This is smashing Basil. I'll go back to the Sixties, recharge my mojo, defeat Dr. Evil and be back in time for tea. \nBASIL EXPOSITION Good luck, Austin. \nAUSTIN Luck has nothing to do with it, Basil. \nAustin steps on the gas. The car lurches in reverse and smashes some equipment. \nAUSTIN Sorry. (changing gears) Swinging Sixties, here I come, baby, yeah! \nThe car takes off, heading for the wall. It DISAPPEARS, leaving flaming tread marks. \nFLASH CUT TO: \nEXT. STREET - LONDON - \nThe Beetle time machine appears out of nowhere and screeches to a stop. A London HIPPIE smoking a hukka watches. He throws the hukka down. Austin hops out. \nAUSTIN I feel better already, man! \nAustin smiles and we see that his teeth are back to being TERRIBLE. He walks off as a crowd gathers around the car. \nEXT. PARK - LONDON \nAustin takes a peak-- nothing. He is panicked. \nFELICITY Oh, that was so relaxing. Felicity stretches very sexily. \nAUSTIN Would you 'like to see my etchings? \nFELICITY (sexy) I think I'm ready for bed. \nShe moves close to Austin. He slides to the other side of the bed. \nAUSTIN I'll get you some PJs. \nFELICITY No, I'm ready for bed. \nShe moves over to him. He avoids her. \nAUSTIN Oh, you'll want to clean your teeth then. \nAustin holds up toothpaste and toothbrush. Felicity finally grabs him and pins him to the bed. \nFELICITY No, I want to have sex with you, Austin. \nAUSTIN Hello Vicar! \nFELICITY I've studied everything about you- your methods, your accomplishments, your preferences. You're the reason I became a spy. Now, I've waited two years to meet you, so I say we get busy making up for lost time. \nAustin sits up. \nAUSTIN (reflective) Felicity, I used to think that way, too, but I guess... I guess I've changed.  Not to make a short story long, or to ramble on and on, or to keep talking in a repetitive manner ad infinitum until it becomes impossible to remember what I was talking about in the first place, but- where was I? \nMUSIC: SAD INSTRUMENTAL \nAUSTIN Oh yes. Felicity, I can't shag you. I've lost my mojo. \nFELICITY (obviously disappointed) Oh. \nAUSTIN I thought coming back to the Sixties would bring it back, but it hasn't. \nFELICITY Austin, don't worry. I know just the man to help you. He's my guru. Ringo recommended him and he's the best. \nAUSTIN I'll warm up the Jumbo Jet, baby! \nEXT. AUSTIN'S PSYCHEDELIC JUMBO JET \nAustin's plane in flight. \nEXT. INDIA - STOCK FOOTAGE \nEXT./INT. BEETLE \nAustin and Felicity drive against obvious rear screen projection of India. \nINT. ASHRAM \nIt looks like a mosque, with incense, tapestries, and DISCIPLES.  Austin and Felicity enter. \nMUSIC: SITAR \nFELICITY There he is. That's my guru. \nWe see the GURU PITKA (played by Mike), an Indian man in a bright red sari. \nFELICITY Guru, I'd like you to meet Austin Powers. \nAUSTIN How are you baby? \nGURU PITKA My chakras are aligned and I am in a perfect state of equipoise. \nAUSTIN Good on ya. I don't know what that means but it sounds fab. \nAUSTIN That's my problem. \nGURU PITKA Ohhhhh, I get it. (beat) No, I don't get it. \nFELICITY He's impotent! \nAUSTIN Alright, easy. (to Guru) Felicity and I were all set for some hump Olympics and I couldn't bat for six. \nGURU PITKA Oh, yes, I see. \nAUSTIN You have no idea what I'm saying, do you? \nGURU PITKA Not a word. \nAUSTIN Guru, I've lost my mojo. \nGURU PITKA Oh, mojo! You should have said so. Well, you've lost your mojo because your chakras are misaligned. You have lost love. \nAUSTIN Lost love? Oh, you mean Vanessa? \nFELICITY Who's Vanessa? \nAUSTIN She was an evil robot minion of Dr. Evil. I couldn't have loved her. \nGURU PITKA Denial ain't just a river in Egypt, buddy. You will only get your mojo back when you surround yourself with love. \nAUSTIN Oh, I get what you're saying now! He's talking about free love, baby! Tune in, turn on, and drop out! \nGURU PITKA I am talking about true love. You must stay and study until you are worthy. \nAUSTIN No way, man. The only way to surround yourself with love is to throw a swinging shin-dig! Yeah, baby, yeah! \nINT. DR.EVIL'S VOLCANO LAIR \nDr. Evil and Frau are interrupted by the man we now know as FAT BASTARD. He is foul-mouthed, and when he swears he is bleeped. \nDR. EVIL Well done, Fat Bastard. May I have the mojo? \nFAT BASTARD First things first, where's your shitter? I've gotta bleepin, turtle head pokin' out. \nDR. EVIL (disgusted) Right. Charming. Fat Bastard- you don't mind me calling you Fat Bastard do you? \nFAT BASTARD I've got a lot of demons kickin' around in my noggin, but weight issues ain't one of them. \nDR. EVIL Alright, Fatty- \nFAT BASTARD The name is Fat Bastard!  I'm the incorrect weight for my height and I was born out of wedlock, hence the moniker Fat Bastard. Hey, I'm not kiddin'. I've got a crap on deck that could choke a donkey. \nDR. EVIL Fat Bastard, the mojo? \nFAT BASTARD Where's my (bleeping) money? \nDR. EVIL A gentlemen never discusses money. \nFAT BASTARD Fine, you can take your (bleep)in' money and shove it up your (bleep), you stupid (bleeping) prick! While you're at it you can suck my greasy, two-toned (bleep)! \nDR. EVIL (pause) Vulgarity is no substitute for wit. \nFAT BASTARD (Bleep) you! \nDR. EVIL Right. Bring in the money. \nDr. Evil PRIVATE ARMY SOLDIERS drive in a forklift loaded with gold bars. \nFAT BASTARD Alright, here it is. \nFat Bastard slowly draws out the high-tech syringe full of MOJO. \nDr. Evil is mesmerized. \nNUMBER TWO Dr. Evil, what are we going to do about Powers? \nDR. EVIL Fat Bastard, in addition to being extremely rotund, you're a vicious killer. \nTake care of it. \nFAT BASTARD It'll be my pleasure. \nDR. EVIL It's an easy job. Without his mojo, Powers will be...powerless? \nINT. AUSTIN'S PAD - NIGHT \nA party, packed with dancing freaks of every stripe, is in full swing. A girl dances in an oversized birdcage. \nAUSTIN This shag-in is gonna blow your mind, baby, yeah! \nThe party sequence is shot like Laugh-In. Very fast cuts to the music. \nAustin sees a VERY PREGNANT WOMAN drinking a martini and smoking.  He gently lifts her drink and cigarette away from her. \nPREGNANT WOMAN Hey! \nAUSTIN You'll thank me later, baby. \nAnother angle. Austin and Felicity dancing. \nAUSTIN (noticing someone) Hey! Ricardo Monteblan, how are you? \nWe see RICARDO MONTEBLAN -smoking a hukka on a round chair. \nRICARDO Hello, Austin! Balls, said the queen and the king laughed because he had too. \nAUSTIN (to camera) Crazy, man! \nFELICITY Let's split up and scope the scene. \nAUSTIN Don't do anything I wouldn't do- at least not without me. \nFelicity slaps Austin on the butt as he walks off. \nAUSTIN Oh, behave! \nCUT TO: \nAustin at the bar with an exotic-looking mod chick. \nAUSTIN (to chick) You're very exotic, baby. Do you have a little English in you? \nCHICK No. \nAUSTIN Would you like to? \nCUT TO: \nAn Alan Zeus-type very gay guy. \nALAN ZEUS GUY (rolling his eyes) This is ridiculous! \nCUT TO: \nA LONDON COP and Felicity are on hanging chairs. \nLONDON COP Have you ever been picked up by the fuzz? \nFELICITY No, but I bet it really hurts. \nCUT TO: \nA GUY IN A RAINCOAT on a tricycle, shot undercranked, rides through the party and falls over. \nAUSTIN That's not a pretty sight. Who is he? \nFELICITY Until recently he worked security for the MOD, but we think he might be a double agent, possibly for Dr. Evil. \nAUSTIN How do you know? \nFELICITY We've noticed that his lifestyle has changed dramatically. He's made a lot of cash purchases, he's hanging out with foxes half his age, and he's becomes quite a fixture on the London party circuit. \nAUSTIN Who's the girl? \nFELICITY I don't know, but it looks like he's splitting. \nFat Bastard exits. \nFELICITY I'll follow him. You see what you can get out of the girl. We'll rendezvous later. \nFelicity follows Fat Bastard out the door. Austin makes his way over to the girl. \nAUSTIN Hello, hello. \nGIRL Hello, Mr. Powers. Fab party. \nAUSTIN Who are you today, baby? \nGIRL Robin. Robin Swallows. \nAUSTIN Swallows? That's an interesting name. Are you English? \nROBIN SWALLOWS German, actually. My maiden name is Spitz. \nAUSTIN Well which is it, baby, Spitz or Swallows? Either way, it's a pleasure. \nROBIN SWALLOWS The pleasure is mine. \nShe extends her hand. Austin takes it and shakes. As he shakes, her cleavage undulates like jello. Austin is transfixed and keeps shaking far too long. \nAUSTIN Charmed, I'm sure. (still shaking, her breasts jiggle) How do you do? (still shaking, jiggling) Yes, quite. (shakes, jiggles) I always enjoy meeting new people. (shakes, jiggles) How's your mum? Good. (shakes, jiggles) I love shaking hands. \nAustin. is shaking her hand so vigorously that she is in danger of popping out of her dress. \nAUSTIN (snapping out of it) So, who was your friend? \nROBIN SWALLOWS His name is Fat Bastard. \nAUSTIN It suits him. \nROBIN SWALLOWS He's my lover. \nAustin is grossed out. \nAUSTIN OK. Would you happen to know if he's in business with a man named Mr. Evil? \nROBIN SWALLOWS I don't know anyone named Dr. Evil. \nAUSTIN Really? I said Mister Evil. Austin does a smug take. \nAUSTIN Something to drink? Would you like a Mister Pepper? \nROBIN SWALLOWS Yes, I'd love a Doctor Pepper. \nAUSTIN Really? I said Mister Pepper. \nAustin does another smug take. Robin grabs Austin and pulls him close. \nROBIN SWALLOWS You're a groovy boy, I'd like to strap you on sometime. \nAUSTIN Oh, behave! \nCUT TO: \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nFelicity is in bed, naked under the sheets, smoking a cigarette.  We hear strange sounds offstage. \nWe pan over to reveal she's IN BED WITH A NAKED FAT BASTARD! \nHe is eating a huge turkey leg, his face covered in food. \nFAT BASTARD I always get (bleep)in' hungry after I get my end away! \nFELICITY I never would have thought that a man of such tremendous girth could be such a, um, creative and sensuous lover! \nFAT BASTARD You want some chicken? I have more! \nHe rolls over to reveal his HUGE NAKED ASS. \nFelicity takes a homing device out of her purse, looks around for a place to plant it. She sees his enormous butt cleavage and realizes that there's only one place for the thing to go. \nANGLE on FAT BASTARD'S face. He is delighted. \nFAT BASTARD Frisky are we? Alright lets have another go! \nShe is horrified. \nINT. DR. EVIL'S VOLCANO LAIR - MAIN ROOM \nDr. Evil at his table with Frau, Scott, and Number Two. \nDR. EVIL Get me the President of the United States. \nThe PRESIDENT appears on Dr. Evil's video screen with his ADVISORS behind him. \nINT. OVAL OFFICE (SPLIT SCREEN) \nPRESIDENT Dr. Evil, what do you want? \nDR. EVIL Not what I want Mr. President, but I will receive. In 12 hours I will destroy Washington, DC with a giant laser. \nDr. Evil reveals a giant laser. Mini-Me is humping it like a dog. \nDR. EVIL OK, Mini-Me, why don't you and the laser get a frickin' room. Honestly. (to President) I will destroy another major city every hour- that is, unless you pay me- \nSNAP ZOOM \nDR. EVIL One hundred billion dollars! \nThe President and his advisors LAUGH. \nPRESIDENT Dr. Evil that's more than the entire federal budget for 1969. \nDR. EVIL Don't play games with me. The capitol will disappear if I don't receive \nSNAP ZOOM \nDR. EVIL One hundred billion dollars! \nHis advisors LAUGH. \nPRESIDENT That much money simply doesn't exist. I don't think l00 billion is even a number. It's like saying I want a kajillion bajillion dollars. \nHis advisors LAUGH. \nDR. EVIL Come on, Mr. President... \nSNAP ZOOM: \nDR. EVIL \"Show me the money!\" \nDr. Evil looks around smugly. No one laughs. \nFELICITY Not details, just what it's like. You know, what's the scene?  Where's it at? \nAUSTIN There've been a lot of advances in the Nineties, baby. The economy is stable, people take better care of their health concern for the environment is on the rise and, um, let's see, there's an entire television channel dedicated to golf. \nFELICITY Sounds awful. \nAUSTIN It's not so bad once you get used to it. The Nineties are about responsibility. You know, having respect for yourself and other people. I even got married. \nFELICITY You? Married? What about the sexual revolution? \nAUSTIN Well, it turns out there were some casualties, baby. Don't you think you'll ever get married? \nFELICITY No, not until I get a little more 'experience' under my belt. \nAUSTIN Oh, behave! \nSuddenly Austin notices something outside and puts his hand to his mouth in fear. \nAUSTIN (wide-eyed) Oh my God! \nFelicity is immediately on her guard. She pulls her gun. \nFELICITY (looking around) What is it! Is it Fat Bastard? \nAUSTIN No, written here on my hand, see? \nAustin turns his hand around to show her. He has written 'oh my God' on his hand with the pen. \nAUSTIN Says 'Oh my God!' \nThey laugh. \nFELICITY Austin, look. \nAustin and Felicity duck into a CAMERA SHOP and come out an instant later with SUPER-8 CAMERAS. \nThey run down the street filming each other. \nAUSTIN AND FELICITY - SUPER-8 MONTAGE \nThis is a Richard Lester-like sequence shot on grainy film from Austin and Felicity's POVs. \nThere's lots of SPEEDED UP stuff and POPPING IN AND OUT of frame like the MONKEES TV show. \nBACK ON THE STREET \nAUSTIN Felicity, I haven't had this much fun since I worked undercover in Amsterdam-- '66 I think it was. \nFELICITY 1965, actually. You posed as a Dutch cheese expert to stop Dr.  Evil from poisoning the world's water supply. \nAustin is impressed. \nFELICITY I've studied your file, Austin. I want to be a trailblazer, just like you.  The Seventies are right around the corner. It's going to be a glorious time for fashion and music and technology-- it won't be long before every flying car has its own 8-track. \nAustin starts to say something, then bites his tongue. \nFELICITY The CIA has always been a boy's club until now. Well move over, this chick's taking over. \nAUSTIN (hoarse) Very impressive. \nFELICITY Austin, your voice! \nAUSTIN Yes, I think I'm coming down with something. \nAustin and Felicity stop at an ICE CREAM MAN with his pushcart. \nAUSTIN I'll get some ice cream. Would you like some? \nFELICITY No thanks. \nAUSTIN Get down! \nFelicity ducks. Austin reaches back and pulls ROBIN SWALLOWS from the back seat and USES HER AS A SHIELD. \nFELICITY We're obviously on the right track. (re: tracking screen) It looks like Fat Bastard is-on an island in the middle of the ocean. \nEXT. DR. EVIL'S ISLANDNIGHT \nWe hear the BEEP-BEEP of the tracking screen. \nEXT. BEACH - DR. EVIL'S ISLAND - NIGHT \nThe Beetle comes from under the water and lands on the beach. We still hear the BEEP-BEEP. \nEXT. TENT - WOODS - NIGHT \nAustin and Felicity have set up a tent with a view of the Dr.  Evil Mt. Rushmore face. Austin is looking at the mountain through a pair of binoculars which hang around his neck. \nAUSTIN According to the readings, Dr. Evil's headquarters is over the next ridge. \nFELICITY Can I have a look? \nAUSTIN Sure. \nAustin hands her the binoculars. Unfortunately the strap is still around his neck, pulling his face into her cleavage. \nFELICITY Question is, how do we get in? \nAUSTIN (muffled) Mmmmmmm...mmmmm... \nFELICITY Austin, did you hear me? \nAUSTIN I seem to be stuck in your dirty pillows. \nFELICITY Where are the topographical maps that Basil drew up? \nAUSTIN I think they're in the tent. \nHe and Felicity enter the tent. A LIGHT is on inside casting shadows of Austin and Felicity on the side of the tent. From the outside it appears the shadow Austin is leaning over with his back to-the shadow Felicity, who appears to have her hands up his butt. \nAUSTIN (V.O.) Have you got it out yet? \nFELICITY (V.O.) Good Lord, Austin, what sort of things do you put in there? \nThe shadow Felicity appears to be tugging a string of sausage links from his ass. \nAUSTIN (V.O.) Oh, anything that catches my fancy. \nFELICITY (V.O.) How do you manage to fit it all in? \nAUSTIN (V.O.) Oh, it stretches to fit. \nThe shadow Felicity appears to pull a tennis racket out of Austin's ass. \nAUSTIN (V.O.) Are you almost done? I can't hold it much longer. \nINT. TENT \nWe see that Austin is leaned over holding part of the tent. \nFelicity is rummaging through a duffel bag across the tent. \nFELICITY Here we go, one hammer. It's amazing how much this duffel bag will hold. \nINT. DR. EVIL'S VOLCANO LAIR \nWe see Dr. Evil playing a piano. We pan to see Mini-Me on top of the piano, himself playing a miniature baby grand. \nDR. EVIL (singing) 'WHAT IF GOD WAS ONE OF US? JUST A SLOB LIKE ONE OF US?' \nAUSTIN No, baby, you're right. I was wrong to judge you. I guess I am... jealous. \nFELICITY But the Austin Powers I knew was wild and crazy and free. He could never be jealous. \nAUSTIN That Austin is gone. I've changed. I knew someone, not long ago, a very special woman. She taught me that life isn't about jumping into the sack with whoever comes along, it's about caring and responsibility. And while it is true she turned out to be an evil robot minion of Dr. Evil, I suppose I really did... love her. \nFELICITY Was that your wife? \nAUSTIN Yes, Vanessa. \nFelicity is touched. \nFELICITY Listen, Austin, I can't pretend to understand everything you've gone through, but I trust you. I'll make you a deal: if we get out of here alive, I'll give monogamy a try. \nAUSTIN With me? \nFELICITY Yes, silly. \nAUSTIN Groovy, baby! \nThey kiss. \nFELICITY We need to lure the guard inside and get his key. \nAUSTIN Alright, what if I pretend to be desperately ill with food poisoning? The guard, drawn by my cries of pain, will come to investigate.  Meanwhile, you dig a pit and line it with makeshift punji sticks made from sharpened toothbrushes. The guard falls in, Bob's your uncle, and we've got the key.  What do you think? \nFELICITY That might work, but how about this? \nFelicity charges towards the window in the door, ripping open her blouse as she goes, showing her breasts to the guard. We, however, can't see them. \nFELICITY (giving a wolf whistle) What do you think of these, my man? \nINT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE CELL \nThe guard is mesmerized by Felicity. \nGUARD Mommy... \nHe unlocks the door and enters. \nINT. JAIL CELL \nThe guard enters an apparently empty cell. We see that Austin is wedged spread-eagle above the door, ready to pounce. \nFELICITY (seductive, to guard) It's very hot in here, don't you think? \nThe guard follows her into the cell. \nFELICITY (irritated) It's very hot in here, don't you think? \nThe guard advances on her. \nFELICITY (breaking cover) Austin! \nAUSTIN (from above) I'm very firmly wedged. \nFELICITY If you want something done... \nShe PUNCHES the guard right in the face and he collapses. \nAUSTIN Almost... got it! \nAustin falls flat on his face with a THUMP and pops back up. \nAUSTIN Let's go get my mojo! \nINT. DR. EVIL'S MOON BASE \nIt is a stark, steel girder and glass structure. Dr. Evil is trying to look dignified but he is FLOATING AWAY. He grabs at the railing of his chair as his feet float up. \nAustin is grossed out. \nFELICITY Are you happy? \nFAT BASTARD What kind of stupid ass question is that? I'm (bleep)in' rich and I'm up to my tits in clean stinky. \nFELICITY You didn't answer my question, are you happy? \nFAT BASTARD It's about my girth isn't it? Sure I could lose a few pounds, but I could shiva git! \nFELICITY Are you happy? \nFAT BASTARD Of course I'm not happy. Look at me, I'm a big fat slob. I've got bigger titties than you do! I've got more (bleep)in' chins than a Chinese phone book.  I've got more crack cheese than a (bleep)in' dairy. I've nay seen ma willie in two years. That's enough time to declare it legally deed! I can't stop eating. I eat because I'm unhappy and I'm unhappy because I eat. (starts to cry) I'm caught in a cycle and there's no escape! \nAUSTIN Maybe inside that Fat Bastard there's a thin bastard, trying to get out \nFAT BASTARD Maybe there's big crap inside me trying to get out, jack-ass!  Enough of your (bleep)in' new age aphorisms. Listen, I've run the gamut of self- help books.  \"Food isn't love\", right, but how do you get it from the page to the (bleep)in' fork?  I'm so weak, I hate myself. I'm for shite. Here, take the mojo. \nFat Bastard hands over the mojo. \nFAT BASTARD I appreciate you trying to reach me, no one can do it for me, I know this now.  There's a hole in my soul that food won't fill. This is the beginning of a new me. I'm gonna go to the gym everyday. If you'll excuse me, there's someone I have to get in touch with and forgive... myself. (pause) Sorry. I farted. (pause) It's a long road ahead. \nEXT. BEACH - DR. EVIL'S ISLAND - DAY \nAustin and Felicity run up to the Beetle. \nAUSTIN Hold on, I have something very important to do. \nAustin drinks the mojo. \nFELICITY How do you feel? \nAUSTIN Sound as a pound, my spuds are boiling. Fancy a shag? \nFELICITY Austin, we don't have time. \nAUSTIN C'mon, luv, let's hop on the good foot and do the bad thing! \nFELICITY Dr. Evil's taken his laser to the moon. The world is in danger. \nAUSTIN Right, the moon. I think I know someone who can give us a lift. \nEXT. CAPE CANAVERAL - APOLLO ROCKET (STOCK FOOTAGE) \nThe Apollo ready for lift-off. \nNEWSCASTER (V.O.) There's been some sort of delay in the launch of Apollo 11, Walter, but we understand that America's first manned mission to the moon will be blasting off shortly. \nINT. CAPSULE \nPan across Austin in a spacesuit, then Felicity in her spacesuit, then CAMEO ASTRONAUT in his space suit. They are surrounded by hundreds of gauges, buttons and meters. \nAUSTIN Gor blimey, you'd have to be a rocket scientist to figure this stuff out. \nASTRONAUT I am a rocket scientist. \nA technician closes the hatch and the countdown begins. \nMISSION COMMANDER (V.O.) We will have lift-off in T minus 10 seconds... 9... 8... etc. \nAUSTIN Felicity, if you get frightened, just hold my hand. \nEXT. CAPE CANAVERAL (STOCK FOOTAGE) \nThe rocket lifts off. \nMISSION COMMANDER (V.O.) We have lift-off! Apollo 11 has cleared the tower and is heading for a rendezvous with the moon. \nINT. APOLLO CAPSULE \nIt is too late. Dr. Evil runs through the TIME PORTAL and gets away. \nAUSTIN Felicity, you have to understand, I thought I had my mojo back.  This isn't fair. \nAustin looks up to the heavens. We see a quick-- \nFLASHBACK - MONTAGE \nof moments they shared, Austin making her laugh, their first kiss, of Felicity being her beautiful and free-spirited self. \nA tear runs down his cheek. Austin presses his face against the glass as if trying to reach her. \nAUSTIN I love you, Felicity! I know I couldn't say it before, but I really do love you! (enraged) Dr. Evil, I'll kill him! \nAustin starts to chase him, but THREE PRIVATE ARMY MEN block his path. Austin is like an animal. \nHe charges toward the first soldier, RIPS HIS HEART OUT, and takes a bite out of it. \nThen Austin turns to the second soldier and RIPS HIS SPINE OUT like in Mortal Kombat. The soldier slumps to the ground. \nThe last soldier is terrified. Austin swings both fists simultaneously, crushing the guy's head which EXPLODES LIKE A PUMPKIN. \nAustin runs over to the TIME PORTAL set for \"75 BC\". He runs through. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ROMAN VILLA - 75 BC \nAn orgy is taking place. Dr. Evil is in a toga with a laurel with two YOUNG ROMAN MEN feeding him grapes. \nDR. EVIL You make love to your wife out of duty, your mistress for pleasure, and a Roman boy for ecstasy. (noticing Austin) Shit. \nHe runs away as Austin appears through the TIME PORTAL. Austin follows Dr. Evil into another TIME PORTAL marked \"1975\". \nEXT. VENTURA BOULEVARD - \nAustin emerges from the TIME PORTAL to see Dr. Evil getting into a car. Austin waves his hands and a 1974 RED FORD TORINO with a white stripe pulls over. \nAUSTIN I have to commandeer this vehicle. (noticing) Hey, aren't you Hutch? \nVOICE (O.S.) No. \nWe see PAUL MICHAEL GLASER (STARSKY). \nPAUL MICHAEL GLASER I'm Starsky. \nDAVID SOUL I'm Hutch. \nAustin jumps in and the Torino speeds off. Dr. Evil's car disappears into a car wash which is a TIME PORTAL. The Torino follows. \nA sign at the car wash reads: \"1911\" \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DECK OF THE TITANIC - \nPassengers in period garb walk past a lifesaver with \"Titanic\" stenciled above it. Dr. Evil enters through a portal with Austin hot on his heels. \nCAPTAIN (O.S.) Iceberg, dead ahead! \nSuddenly the ship tilts at a radical angle. LEONARDO DICAPRIO, KATE WINSLET, and JAMES CAMERON slide by. \nJAMES CAMERON I'm king of the world! \nDr. Evil and Austin slide backwards into the TIME PORTAL they just came from. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

No one can take your, mojo away from you! \nDR. EVIL Good-bye, Mr. Powers, for the last time. \nDr. Evil hits the SELF-DESTRUCT button and climbs aboard the rocket, which blasts off. \nEXT.

Suddenly, he sees the Citroen coming at him.  He dives out of the way and takes off running. He rounds a corner and pretends to be a COUPLE MAKING OUT against a wall by hugging himself. \nThe assassin sees him and slams on the brakes. He raises his gun. \nAustin turns as he hears a car HONK. \nIt's Austin's BEETLE CONVERTIBLE. The mysterious woman steps out. \nWe see her in her entirety for the first time, and what a sight it is. She has long auburn hair and wears a tight racing suit, unzipped just enough to show the female symbol medallion. \nShe is FELICITY SHAGWELL. \nMUSIC: FELICITY'S THEME \nFELICITY Care for a ride? \nAUSTIN That's my Beetle, baby. \nFELICITY It was your Beetle.

AUSTIN'S PAD \nThe room is dark, with only a single spotlight providing illumination. Suddenly, Austin and Felicity rise on an elevator into the middle of the spotlight. \nAUSTIN Welcome to my shag pad, baby. \nLight floods the pad, revealing hanging basket chairs, Hi- fi, and Warhol silk screens of Austin. \nAustin blows DUST off a table. \nAUSTIN Care for something to drink? \nAustin hits a button and a bookcase revolves to reveal a wetbar. \nAUSTIN Or perhaps something to read? \nAustin walks seductively over to the real wetbar and hits a button.

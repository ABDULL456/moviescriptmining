{"test1_input": "DR. SERCARZ (CONT'D) The good news is that he's breathing without the use of a mechanical apparatus, and there are no lesions or hemorrhages in any of the CT scans. \nJOSH So...there's no brain damage or...? \nDR. SERCARZ None that we've detected. Technically, he's in a coma. He doesn't respond to stimuli, he has no sleep-wake cycle, but there's no brain trauma or infection. His scans are normal. To be honest, I've never seen anything like it. \nJOSH That fall he took...I mean, it looked like he hit his head pretty hard. \nDR. SERCARZ We definitely exhausted that possibility, but it was always doubtful. The cut was superficial, there wasn't even a skull fracture. \nRENAI He can't just not wake up...there's got to be something... \nRenai sobs, tears streaming down her face. Josh looks like a deer in the headlights. Stunned dumb. \nSercarz clears his throat. This part of the job isn't his specialty. \nDR. SERCARZ I'm sorry. \nJOSH So what do we do now? Does he stay here? \nDR. SERCARZ We'll conduct some further testing, but beyond that...I really don't know. \nHis pager goes off. He checks it. \nDR. SERCARZ (CONT'D) Excuse me for a minute. I have to step out. A nurse will be with you in just a moment. \nHe leaves quickly. Josh and Renai press on the glass, separated in body and spirit from their son. \nFADE TO BLACK. \nSUPERIMPOSE TITLE: TWO MONTHS LATER \nINT. DALTON'S BEDROOM, LAMBERT HOME - DAY \nA ghastly meld of hospital room and young boys bedroom. \nDalton lies on his bed, a heart rate monitor hooked to his chest. IV tubes run into his arms, a Nasogastric feeding tube into his mouth. \nA young nurse, ADELE CHALFIN (30), checks the various tubes as Renai watches on. \nADELE Are you having any more trouble with the feeding tube? \nRenai looks broken, the life drained from her. A wilted flower. She shakes her head, her voice a low rasp. \nRENAI (BARELY AUDIBLE) It's okay. \nADELE Alright, well I'll be back soon. I'll bring some new books. You're probably sick of the ones you have. \nRENAI Did he respond to any of the tests? \nAdele pauses. \nADELE No...no, he didn't. But we have to give it time. I've seen coma patients with a much longer inactivity time suddenly start making noises. \nRENAI He's not in a coma, remember? They don't know what to call it. They don't know what to do with him so they've given up. \nADELE No, they haven't. We're going to figure it out. \nAdele hugs her, then exits. Renai slumps down on a chair next to her son. \nThe heart rate monitor pings. Dalton is as still as a statue. \nINT. CORRIDOR - DAY \nRenai shuffles down the corridor. She passes a bedroom door, then stops and doubles back, pushing it open and going into-- \nINT. CALI'S NURSERY - CONTINUOUS \n--the babies room. \nShe stares into the crib...at her other sleeping baby. She sets the baby monitor and walks out softly. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - DAY \nRenai slumps in front of her piano. Taps one of the keys. \nShe plays a discordant melody of low notes with one hand, not present enough to hear it. \nShe stops and buries her face in her hands. \nThen she hears it. Whispering. \nIt's so low you would miss it if the house wasn't absolutely silent. Renai looks up, scanning for the source of the murmur. \nIt is coming from the baby monitor. \nConfused, Renai picks up the monitor, turning up the volume all the way up. The hissssssss of static fills the room. \n", "test1_true": "VOICE (FROM MONITOR) They see us...all of us...we have to be quick...this life begs us to come back. \nThe whisper trails off....more static... \nVOICE (CONT'D) (FROM MONITOR) NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!! \nRenai drops the baby monitor, leaping out of her skin at the sound of the scream. Nerves fried. \nThe monitor smashes on the floor. All is quiet. \nRenai moves to the door, staring down the corridor at the door to Cali's nursery. \nIt is open only a crack. She hears crying. Cali is crying. \nWe follow her as she bolts towards the nursery, smashing through the door, eyes filled with terror, seeing-- \n--nothing. \nINT. NURSERY - CONTINUOUS \nRenai stalks into the room. \nThe room is empty, save for Cali, crying in her crib. Renai's eyes land on the closet. \nANGLE FROM INSIDE THE CLOSET \nThrough a slight crack, we see Renai approach. Breath quivering. Her hand reaches out. She FLINGS the door open. \nIt is empty. \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nThe family is eating. It's very quiet. \nFoster keeps his eyes down as his parents eat in silence. Suddenly Cali breaks the quiet, squealing happily. \nCALI Dadda! \nJosh looks up, smiling. Amazed. \nJOSH She said dad... \nNeither Renai nor Foster even look up. \nINT. FOSTER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nA bedside lamp gives off a jaundice glow. \nRenai gathers up scattered toys from the floor, relocating them to a desktop covered in beakers and lab equipment. \nFoster lies in bed beneath a large chart of the solar system. \nRenai stops cleaning when she finds a certificate, crumpled next to a school bag. It says IN RECOGNITION OF SCIENCE SKILL, AWARDED TO FOSTER LAMBERT ON 3/14/10. \nRENAI What's this? \nFOSTER An award. \nRENAI That's today's date. You got this today? \nFoster nods meekly. \nRENAI (CONT'D) Why didn't you tell us, honey? \nShe sits on the edge of his bed. He stares at the wall. She strokes his hair. \nRENAI (CONT'D) I know it's hard right now. But things will get better. I promise. \nFoster nods. \nRENAI (CONT'D) I'm going to show this to your dad. \nShe plants a kiss his forehead and stands up. \nFOSTER I'm scared, mom. \nRENAI Scared of what? \nFOSTER Dalton. \nRenai sits back down. \nRENAI We're all scared. It's normal to be scared for him. But we can't give up-- \nFOSTER Why do I have to sleep so close to him? Can't I change rooms? \n", "test1_id": 2928, "test2_input": "JOSH Just take it without me. \nPHOTOGRAPHER We need you in the photo, sir. \nJOSH No, you don't. Just take the damn photo without me, okay? \nThe class settles down, shocked by the outburst. Chastened, the photographer turns to the class, gripping the camera trigger. \nPHOTOGRAPHER I can't believe this is my life. (beat; to class) Ready kids? Say asshole teacher! \nINT. GYMNASIUM, FORRESTER HIGH SCHOOL - LATER \nThe students file out of the gym. Josh sits in the bleachers, head buried in his hands. \nALANSO (O.S.) I hear things. \nJosh looks up, seeing Alanso. \nJOSH What? \nALANSO I spend so much time in the office, I hear things. I heard about your son. I'm sorry. \nJOSH Thank you, Alanso. \nALANSO Times like these...people realize that science doesn't have all the answers. There is a higher force at work. \nJOSH I wish I had your belief. Things would be a lot simpler. \nALANSO Things are simple. You just can't see it. Put your faith in Him. \nHe places his gold cross necklace in Josh's hand, then leaves. Josh watches him go, then takes out his cell phone. \nJOSH (INTO PHONE) Hey...I just found out I have to stay back tonight and finish off mid-term grades. It could be a while, there's a lot to go through. Don't wait up. Bye. \nEXT. PARK - NIGHT \nJosh sits on a park bench, staring into the distance. He takes out a flask of whisky, swigging from it. \nINT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT \nRenai lies in bed, staring at the ceiling. Alone. \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nRenai shuffles in, pouring herself a glass of water. Then she hears it. A low muttering. It is coming from Dalton's room. \nINT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nUnnerved, Renai peers through the open door. Josh is sitting beside Dalton's bed, reading to him. \nJOSH The men all walked down to the waters edge...and they stood there and asked the beast to come forth. And the beast roared back \"No!\". And so they dived in after it... \nEXT. LAMBERT HOME \nIn the sunlight, the house looks like a happy place. \nINT. DALTON'S BEDROOM - DAY \nDalton's face is a picture of serenity. \nA new day-shift nurse, KELLY (29), checks on his feeding tube. Renai watches from the doorway. \nKELLY You okay? \nRENAI Yeah. \nKELLY I was going to head off for an hour or so. Are you alright here? \nRENAI Of course. Anything from Dalton? \nKELLY No. I'm sorry. \nRenai nods. Her eyes brim with tears. The cracks are showing. \nKELLY (CONT'D) Keep providing him with stimuli. I've seen it work time and time again. Read to him. Even if you're doing something else, you can play him music that he likes. Don't give up. \nShe throws a scarf over her shoulder and stands. \nRENAI I won't, I just...I haven't slept much the last couple of nights. I feel like the universe is trying to see how far I can bend before I break. \nKELLY The universe picked a fight with the wrong chick. \nRENAI Thanks, Kelly. You're a saint. \nKELLY No, I'm not. I'm doing my job. I chose to be here. You didn't choose any of this. You're the strong one. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - DAY \n", "test2_true": "INT. BATHROOM - DAY \nWater cascades out of a faucet. Steam rises from the water. \nRenai lets bath salts fall into the tub. She almost looks relaxed just smelling them. \nShe starts to undress, then turns -- \n-- and YELPS in fright. \nA person is standing behind the distorted glass window, staring in at her. \nThe shape of the person's head and shoulders can clearly be seen, but the glass is too opaque to make out any features. \nRenai slips, grabbing the sink. When she glances up, the figure is gone. \nTrembling, Renai opens the window. Very, very slowly. \nIt is fifteen feet off the ground, with a sheer drop below it. \nEXT. LAMBERT HOME - NIGHT \nRenai sits on the front steps, alone. It is late. She looks somehow tired and wired at the same time. Smoking a cigarette. \nJosh pulls in. Fumbles out of his car, tipsy. \nJOSH What are you doing up? \nRENAI It's midnight, Josh. \nJOSH When did you start smoking? \nRENAI You've been coming home late every single night. You've never had to do that in all of the years you've been at the school. Now all of a sudden you have to stay back late? \nJOSH I don't like it either, but I'm grading tests. What choice do I have? We've gotta pay Dalton's bills. \nRENAI Your mother is paying Dalton's bills, Josh. I know because she reminds me every chance she gets. \nJOSH Jesus, I can't win with you. That's my son in there too, not just yours! \nHe paces, the anger sobering him. \nJOSH (CONT'D) I've always felt like less than good enough for you. I feel it every time you mention our bills. That subtle voice that says `can't you get a job that pays more than a teacher'? And now I can't even look at you without feeling it. \nRENAI You're projecting that onto me. You've written an entire story about I'm how I'm feeling without once asking me how I'm feeling. \nJOSH I don't need to ask. I know you. \nRENAI I am losing my mind here in this house, Josh. I'm scared and I need you and you're not here. Where are you? \nJOSH I told you, I'm grading tests. \nRENAI I don't mean that. I mean you're not here. With me. In this situation. You're avoiding it, like you do anything stressful, whether it's this or a parking ticket. \nJOSH Christ, I should have stayed at the school. \nRENAI There you go again. \nRenai stands up and walks inside the house. The door closes. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nJosh tosses a pillow onto the couch, setting himself up for the night. He curls up on it, pulling a blanket over himself. \nINT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nThe witching hour. Still. Quiet...save for the omnipresent clock. \nINT. DALTON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nDalton is as still as we've seen him. And then...he twitches. A slight facial twitch, but we see it. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nJosh snoozes, head arched at a bad angle. His back will regret sleeping on this couch. \nINT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT \nRenai tosses and turns, restless in sleep. \nHer eyes open and she sucks in a breath. Bad dreams. \nShe blinks and looks around the room, surprised to be alone, sitting up in fright. Until she remembers why. She eases back onto the bed. Then she looks over at the window. \nThere is a man standing outside it. \n", "test2_id": 2929, "test3_input": "INT. MASTER BEDROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT \nJosh lies beside Renai, who is sleeping. He is wide awake, staring at the ceiling. \nHe gets out of bed. \nINT. DALTON'S BEDROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe door opens. \nAll is mute as Josh enters, skulking carefully through the darkness. \nThe curtains lull in the slightest of breezes. \nJosh stands over Dalton. \nHe stares down at his sons body, then lets his gaze drift around the room...past the CLOSET, past the DRAWINGS pinned to the wall and the TOYBOX...all the way to the CORNER of the ceiling that Elise was so frightened of. Josh's eyes drill into the shadows. \nIs there something waiting there? \nFinally, Josh sits down beside Dalton. He grips his sons hand. \nJOSH Where are you? Where did you go? (BEAT) Can you hear me? I'm begging you to show me that you can hear me...I don't know how to help you. Please tell me what to do. \nJosh's torment fills the air...but Dalton doesn't move. \nJOSH (CONT'D) Please God, please help me...give me my son back. I will do anything just to have him back. \nJosh studies Dalton's face for a response. Nothing. Not a twitch. He collapses forward onto Dalton. Holding him tight. \nJOSH (CONT'D) I need him back. I need him to show me that he can hear me. Please... \nFor a moment, all we can hear is Josh's breathing. \nThen...something happens. Something Josh doesn't see. \nDalton's face twitches. It is a very slight movement. This movement is followed by something that is hard to miss-- \nOne of the tacks pinning one of Dalton's drawings to the wall begins to wind loose. \nIt pops free, shooting across the room like a kernel of popcorn...followed by another tack. \nThe second tack lands in Josh's lap. Puzzled, he picks it up, examining it. He looks up, his eye drawn to the picture on the wall. \nWith total astonishment, he sees the two remaining tacks works themselves free, popping out of the wall. \nThe drawing floats down to the ground. \nJosh stoops down, picking it up. \nIt is a drawing split into two halves. The left half is a self portrait of Dalton, lying in bed, looking down from above. \nThe right half is a depiction of outer space - squiggly stars and bloated planets. \nDalton has drawn another version of himself on this side, flying above the house with another man. \nAt the bottom of the first drawing, Dalton has written `Last night I watched myself sleep'. \nA tear falls down Josh's face. He begins to cry. Deep and painful tears he has long pent up. \nBeneath the second drawing, Dalton has written `Then I flew away.' \nINT. MASTER BEDROOM, NEW HOUSE - EARLY MORNING \nRenai's eyes flutter open. She glances over. No one is there. \nINT. KITCHEN, NEW HOUSE - EARLY MORNING \nRenai shuffles into the kitchen. \nJosh is sitting at the kitchen table, staring at Dalton's drawing. He hasn't slept and looks it. He looks up at her. \nJOSH Okay. \nRenai approaches Josh and they hug...holding on for dear life. \nEXT. NEW HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe Lambert house is lit from within. Like a Jack-O-Lantern. \nINT. DALTON'S ROOM - NIGHT \nAction stations. \nTucker sets up two stills camera's around Dalton's room, zipping back and forth between the two tripods. Specs opens up a kit, taking out his notepad and a pencil. \nA small, circular table has been set up, adjacent to Dalton's bed. Elise sits at the table, flanked on either side by Josh and Renai. \n", "test3_true": "Josh and Renai nod grimly, truly out of their depth. \nELISE (CONT'D) Forget the limits and laws and logic of this world. We are treading in a different place now. \nTucker finally sets his cameras and takes a seat in the corner, holding up a HAND-HELD VIDEO CAMERA. \nTUCKER These still cameras are rigged to pick up changes in the atmosphere, electrical or temperature-wise. Don't be alarmed if they go off. \nELISE Everything I say while I am in tune will be at a very low volume, so you won't hear any of it. Steven will write it down and repeat it for you. \nSpecs waits obediently at her side. \nELISE (CONT'D) Hold on to each other, and stay focused. You'll see things you don't understand. Confusing things. Do not question them or speak in any way. \nShe turns to Specs. \nELISE (CONT'D) Dim the lights please. \nTucker reaches up and dims the lights to a very low level. \nElise closes her eyes, concentrating. She relaxes her head, as if meditating, letting it loll on her shoulders. \nOne of the cameras on the tripod goes off, bathing the room in white light for a split second. \nElise inhales and exhales deeply, slipping away. Soon, she is very still. \nSpecs nods to Tucker silently, then produces an odd looking device made from GREY CLOTH. \nIt almost resembles a gas mask from World War 1, with a cone shaped muzzle that fits over the mouth and nose. The snout of the facemask is like an elongated elephant trunk, coiling outwards and ending in an old listening device, like an early version of a microphone. \nSpecs slips two hooks over Elise's ears and gently places the device over her nose and mouth. He then takes a seat next to her, behind Renai, who holds Elise's hand. \nSpecs takes out his notepad and fixes a small apparatus around his neck that holds a flashlight in place. \nHe flicks it on, then holds the microphone end of Elise's facemask up to his ear, a pencil gripped in the other hand. \nDead silence descends over the group like a blanket. \nThen, we hear something lilt through the old microphone. It is Elise's muttered whispers. Specs begins writing. \nRenai opens her eyes to peek at what he is scribbling in cursive. \nwe are calling out to you dalton Renai grips Josh's hand tightly. \nSPECS We are calling out to you Dalton. \ntell us that you are safe tell us where you are SPECS (CONT'D) Tell us that you are safe. Tell us where you are. \nFor what seems like an eternity, all is quiet and still... \n...until Elise's eyelids flutter. \nAnother unintelligible whisper drifts out of the microphone at Specs' ear. He writes. who's there? SPECS (CONT'D) Who's there? it is your mother and father we have been looking for you SPECS (CONT'D) It is your mother and father. We have been looking for you. \nLong pause. Specs writes again, more intense this time. \ni need help i can't see in here SPECS (CONT'D) I need help...I can't see in here. \nfollow my voice dalton come back to us SPECS (CONT'D) Follow my voice Dalton. Come back to us. \nAnother long pause. A little too long. \nWhy aren't you talking anymore dalton? SPECS (CONT'D) Why aren't you talking anymore Dalton? \nA long beat. Tucker's camera flash goes off again. \nif they hear me they'll hurt me SPECS (CONT'D) If they hear me, they'll hurt me. \nwho will hurt you?

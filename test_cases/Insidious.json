{"train": "INSIDIOUS \nWritten by \nLeigh Whannell \nThe universe is deathless; Is deathless because, having no finite self, it stays infinite. A sound man by not advancing himself stays the further ahead of himself, By not confining himself to himself, sustains himself outside himself. \n--LAOZI \nFADE IN \nINT. DARKENED BEDROOM - NIGHT \nA spherical black monolith rises up from a white surface... white like the moon. \nIn the darkness, the towers metal skin is barely visible. \nWe ROTATE AROUND, revealing the tower to actually be a LAMP -- not rising up from a surface, but hanging down from a white ceiling. The bulb unlit. \nDirectly below the lamp is the very definition of innocence - a sleeping child. Chest rising and falling with each breath. \nWe HOVER over the young boy...watching him. A blanket emblazoned with dinosaurs is draped across his limbs. His mouth is slack, eyelids twitching to dreams unseen. \nThe truly deep sleep that an adult can only wish for. \nWe move away from him, exploring the dark room. Strewn with toys. The door is slightly ajar. We float through it into-- \nINT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS \n--a long hallway. Even darker than the bedroom. And without the boys rhythmic breathing, even quieter. \nA window at the end of the hall enlarges as we approach. \nSomeone is standing in front of it. \nThe murky silhouette of the figure turns and walks away. We follow it, tentative. Turning a corner, we see the figure. Standing in a doorway. \nNow we can make out the edges of the person. It is an old woman. Hair in a Victorian bun. A corseted dress. \nShe stares at us. \nWOMAN Let me in. \nCUT TO: \nOPENING TITLES play out to the shrill screams of George Crumb's `Black Angels I: Night Of The Electric Insects'. \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nEyes flick open. \nA woman blinks awake, gazing around the room. Another bedroom. Sparse. Just a bed and a cabinet. It is 5.43 AM. \nHer eyes settle on the man lying next to her in the dark. His heaving snores have woken her up. \nShe is RENAI (pronounced Renee) LAMBERT (36). With a quiet determination she is holding on to her youthful good looks, but the lines of age are creeping in. \nShe has settled into the `comfort' years of a marriage: hair pinned up messily, wearing dowdy pajamas. \nShe beholds her husband, taking him in. Considering him. He snorts and smacks his lips. Very unflattering. \nShe climbs out of bed. \nINT. LIVING ROOM, LAMBERT HOME - NIGHT \nHigh ceilings. Exposed beams. Spanish style windows. \nRenai treads across wooden floorboards into a sunken living room. No matter careful she is, there is a loud creak with each step. A GRANDFATHER CLOCK in the corner ticks steadily. \nThere is barely any furniture in here, only a BOOKCASE and a PIANO. What there is a lot of...is boxes. Large moving boxes. \nRenai plops cross-legged onto the floor and rips open one of the boxes, marked BOOKS. She plucks out a handful of books and lines them up on the bookshelf. Then another handful. \nThey are all self-help and self-improvement books. Titles like `Be The Better You' and `Inch By Inch, It's A Cinch: A Guide To Achieving Your Goals' pop out. \nShe spots a sealed box labelled PHOTO ALBUMS. She strips away the tape and wrestles out a dusty album of wedding photos. \nSmiling faces greet her as she thumbs through the pages. The happy couple. Young. Glowing. Sadness washes over her. \nVOICE (O.S.) Mom? \nShe snaps out of it and turns to see DALTON LAMBERT (8). Her son. He approaches her, rubbing his eyes. (It is not the boy we saw in the opening scene.) \nRENAI What are you doing up, kiddo? \nDALTON I don't like my room. \nALANSO Maybe you do, but I was created in the image of my Dios. \nHe takes a gold cross hanging on a necklace out of his shirt, kissing it and holding it up. That gets another laugh. \nJOSH I respect your right to believe that, Alanso. But I want to give you all possible theories. I want this class to go out into the world with an informed opinion. \nALANSO The theory is incorrect, Mr. Lambert. \nJOSH How can it be incorrect? It's a theory. A scientific theory. \nALANSO Yeah, well, science is bullshit. We didn't get here cos of no test-tubes. \nJOSH Alanso, if you keep talking like that I'm going to ask you to visit the principal. \nALANSO Fine. \nHe gets up and leaves as the class JEERS and BOOS. \nINT. LIVING ROOM, LAMBERT HOME - DAY \nPeace and quiet at last. \nRenai gropes in behind the bookcase, plucking a hidden jewelry box free. She pinches a cigarette out of it and lights it. \nShe sits down at her piano, feeling the keys, warming her fingers up. Sunlight streams in through the windows. \nShe takes out a notebook, filled with scribbled handwriting. \nShe places the notebook on the sheetstand, then sets a small, mechanical METRONOME in motion and begins tapping out a sombre melody in time with it. \nRENAI (SINGING) Yeah, I'm looking west, always been looking that way, gonna get it all happening, just can't do it today... \nShe stops and makes a note in her book. She starts over, rising to the emotion of the song. She's got a good voice. \nRENAI (CONT'D) (SINGING) Yeah, I'm looking west, always been looking that way, I'm gonna be somebody, I just can't be her today-- \nShe is interrupted by the tinny sound of a baby crying. \nShe stops playing and looks over at a baby monitor, the source of the noise. \nRenai deflates, her shoulders sagging in defeat. She closes her notebook and leaves the room. \nINT. CALI'S NURSERY - DAY \nRenai scoops up Cali, rocking her gently. \nA scratching sound interrupts. Rough. Frantic. Like a dog pawing at something. \nINT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nRenai steps into the hall, curious. She can still hear it. She follows the sound to a door. Grabs the door handle. \nThe sound abruptly ceases. \nINT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS \nThe door whines open and stabs a blade of light onto a set of stairs that descend into a gloomy basement. \nRenai stands at the top of the stairs, squinting into the inky blackness, straining to see. \nShe reaches up and yanks a light chain, illuminating a bare bulb and throwing light across the tenebrous space. \nThe basement is large and completely bare. Cleaned out. \nRenai takes a step down. She is still carrying Cali. \nFURTHER DOWN below her, we see that there is one step that is cracked and broken. \nShe takes another step. The broken step is right below her now. \nOne more step and she will fall. \nCali squeals happily. Renai pauses...then turns around, heading back up the stairs. Stops when she sees something. \nDEEP, VIOLENT SCRATCH MARKS...running downwards on the inside of the door...as if someone were trying to claw their way out. \nEXT. LAMBERT HOME - NIGHT \nA Spanish-style home. Very pretty. This is not the suburbs. More of an inner city neighborhood. There's history here. \nJosh pulls into the driveway of his new house in his Subaru. \nINT. LIVING ROOM, LAMBERT HOME - NIGHT \nThe house almost looks liveable. \nFoster is watching loud, zany cartoons on TV. Cali is in a high chair. Renai is folding boxes. She has unpacked most of the living room and is very tired. \nJosh carries him up the stairs as he sucks in sobs. \nRenai glances around the basement, her eyes landing on the lone object that resides in it. \nShe frowns. It wasn't there when she saw the basement last. \nIt is a box. One of her large, cardboard moving boxes. \nIt is marked LAMPS. \nINT. DALTON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nDalton is lying in bed, a band-aid slapped across his forehead. Renai tucks him in, Josh standing over him. \nJOSH You're lucky you don't need stitches. \nRENAI If I catch you falling down the stairs again I'm gonna break your neck. \nDALTON That doesn't make sense. \nThere are dozens of pictures tacked to the wall, all drawn by Dalton. Josh taps one; a drawing of Dalton flying through the night sky, wearing his cape. \nDALTON (CONT'D) You might be a superhero but you're not invincible. Be more careful, bud. \nRenai kisses him and gets up. \nRENAI Sleep tight, honey. \nThey wave goodbye and turn out the light. \nINT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT \nRenai flops into bed beside Josh, exhausted. \nJOSH We've gotta lock that door. \nRENAI He's such a boy. He goes off exploring. Sometimes I wanna keep him on one of those child leashes. \nJOSH Why bother with a child leash? I'll stop at the pet store tomorrow. \nShe laughs and cuddles up to him, resting her head on his chest. \nRENAI I'm sorry I was pissy when you got home. I was trying to work on a song today and then Cali woke up and wouldn't stop crying... \nJOSH I didn't even notice. \nRENAI I feel guilty for wanting my own time. \nJOSH It's normal to want your own time. \nRENAI Is it? My mother gave up everything for me. I keep waiting for the completely selfless parent gene to kick in, but I'm exactly the same person I was when I was 22, only now I'm married with kids. \nJOSH You're a great mother. \nRENAI No, I'm not. They like you so much better than me. \nJOSH That's not true. \nRENAI You're the cool dad who comes home with presents and I'm the one who yells at them all day. \nJOSH Now you're being crazy. They love you. At least you get to connect with them. I work so much. \nRENAI Believe me, you're their hero. They try to play us off against each other. They're master manipulators. I guess they really are my kids. \nJosh laughs. A lull settles over them. \nRENAI (CONT'D) Is this it, Josh? \nJOSH Is this so bad? \nShe doesn't answer. They sit in silence for a long beat. \nRENAI Thank you for letting me take some time off to work on my music again. \nJOSH We'll get by. I want you to do it. \nRENAI There's a couple of songs...I mean not all of them, but there's a couple of them that I think are really good. And I think, maybe I could do something with them. \nJOSH I love all your songs. \nThey kiss. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nIt is 3AM. All the remoteness of that hour is present here...we can feel it. \nAs still and quiet as deep space. \nDR. SERCARZ (CONT'D) The good news is that he's breathing without the use of a mechanical apparatus, and there are no lesions or hemorrhages in any of the CT scans. \nJOSH So...there's no brain damage or...? \nDR. SERCARZ None that we've detected. Technically, he's in a coma. He doesn't respond to stimuli, he has no sleep-wake cycle, but there's no brain trauma or infection. His scans are normal. To be honest, I've never seen anything like it. \nJOSH That fall he took...I mean, it looked like he hit his head pretty hard. \nDR. SERCARZ We definitely exhausted that possibility, but it was always doubtful. The cut was superficial, there wasn't even a skull fracture. \nRENAI He can't just not wake up...there's got to be something... \nRenai sobs, tears streaming down her face. Josh looks like a deer in the headlights. Stunned dumb. \nSercarz clears his throat. This part of the job isn't his specialty. \nDR. SERCARZ I'm sorry. \nJOSH So what do we do now? Does he stay here? \nDR. SERCARZ We'll conduct some further testing, but beyond that...I really don't know. \nHis pager goes off. He checks it. \nDR. SERCARZ (CONT'D) Excuse me for a minute. I have to step out. A nurse will be with you in just a moment. \nHe leaves quickly. Josh and Renai press on the glass, separated in body and spirit from their son. \nFADE TO BLACK. \nSUPERIMPOSE TITLE: TWO MONTHS LATER \nINT. DALTON'S BEDROOM, LAMBERT HOME - DAY \nA ghastly meld of hospital room and young boys bedroom. \nDalton lies on his bed, a heart rate monitor hooked to his chest. IV tubes run into his arms, a Nasogastric feeding tube into his mouth. \nA young nurse, ADELE CHALFIN (30), checks the various tubes as Renai watches on. \nADELE Are you having any more trouble with the feeding tube? \nRenai looks broken, the life drained from her. A wilted flower. She shakes her head, her voice a low rasp. \nRENAI (BARELY AUDIBLE) It's okay. \nADELE Alright, well I'll be back soon. I'll bring some new books. You're probably sick of the ones you have. \nRENAI Did he respond to any of the tests? \nAdele pauses. \nADELE No...no, he didn't. But we have to give it time. I've seen coma patients with a much longer inactivity time suddenly start making noises. \nRENAI He's not in a coma, remember? They don't know what to call it. They don't know what to do with him so they've given up. \nADELE No, they haven't. We're going to figure it out. \nAdele hugs her, then exits. Renai slumps down on a chair next to her son. \nThe heart rate monitor pings. Dalton is as still as a statue. \nINT. CORRIDOR - DAY \nRenai shuffles down the corridor. She passes a bedroom door, then stops and doubles back, pushing it open and going into-- \nINT. CALI'S NURSERY - CONTINUOUS \n--the babies room. \nShe stares into the crib...at her other sleeping baby. She sets the baby monitor and walks out softly. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - DAY \nRenai slumps in front of her piano. Taps one of the keys. \nShe plays a discordant melody of low notes with one hand, not present enough to hear it. \nShe stops and buries her face in her hands. \nThen she hears it. Whispering. \nIt's so low you would miss it if the house wasn't absolutely silent. Renai looks up, scanning for the source of the murmur. \nIt is coming from the baby monitor. \nConfused, Renai picks up the monitor, turning up the volume all the way up. The hissssssss of static fills the room. \nRENAI Why would you wanna change rooms? \nFoster swallows. \nFOSTER I don't know. \nRenai stares at her son. She kisses him again. \nRENAI Your brother needs you. Goodnight honey. \nINT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT \nJosh lies in bed, reading Foster's award. Renai is beside him. \nRENAI Something happened today. I didn't want to tell you in front of Foster. \nJOSH What? \nRENAI I heard something coming from Cali's room. A man's voice. On the baby monitor...it scared the hell outta me. I went in there and no one was there. \nJOSH Could it have been interference? \nRENAI I don't know. It was so clear. I was sitting at the piano and I heard this...whispering on the baby monitor. So I held my ear up to it-- \nSUDDENLY - a noise interrupts. An arrhythmic KNOCKING sound, like a drunk pounding on a tavern door after closing. \nIt is the front door. \nJOSH Who the hell is that? \nJosh knows it's his job to check, but he doesn't want to. \nJOSH (CONT'D) Stay here. \nHe gets up. \nINT. FRONT DOOR - NIGHT \nJosh approaches the front door, flashlight in hand. He peers through curtains at the front step. \nIt's too dark to see anything. \nJOSH Hello? Who's there? \nOnly the wind replies. \nHe aims the flashlight at the glass, shining it into the thick darkness. There is no one on the front step. \nJosh presses the flashlight against the window, arcing the beam across his front garden. Leans in close to the glass... \nAND THEN-- \nNothing. There's no one there. \nHe makes sure the door is locked, then flips open a security system panel on the wall, pecking at the buttons on it. \nINT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT \nRenai sits up in bed, listening. Hears nothing... \n...until the low moans of a baby crying float out of the baby monitor. Renai hurls the sheet aside. \nINT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nRenai pads down the hall, tentative. \nShe reaches the open door to Cali's room. Sees the silhouette of Josh standing over Cali's crib. Exhales with relief. \nRENAI Who was it, Josh? \nJosh appears at the opposite end of the hallway. \nJOSH What did you say? \nRenai SCREAMS as the silhouette recedes into the shadows. \nRENAI There's someone in there! \nShe RUNS towards Josh. \nRENAI (CONT'D) There's someone in Cali's room! \nJosh BOLTS down the hall, flicking on the light, terrified. \nThe nursery is empty. Cali is sleeping. Terrified, Josh enters the room. Scans around. Only toys and colorful wallpaper. \nHe steps in further. He's not cut out for this. \nJOSH Just take it without me. \nPHOTOGRAPHER We need you in the photo, sir. \nJOSH No, you don't. Just take the damn photo without me, okay? \nThe class settles down, shocked by the outburst. Chastened, the photographer turns to the class, gripping the camera trigger. \nPHOTOGRAPHER I can't believe this is my life. (beat; to class) Ready kids? Say asshole teacher! \nINT. GYMNASIUM, FORRESTER HIGH SCHOOL - LATER \nThe students file out of the gym. Josh sits in the bleachers, head buried in his hands. \nALANSO (O.S.) I hear things. \nJosh looks up, seeing Alanso. \nJOSH What? \nALANSO I spend so much time in the office, I hear things. I heard about your son. I'm sorry. \nJOSH Thank you, Alanso. \nALANSO Times like these...people realize that science doesn't have all the answers. There is a higher force at work. \nJOSH I wish I had your belief. Things would be a lot simpler. \nALANSO Things are simple. You just can't see it. Put your faith in Him. \nHe places his gold cross necklace in Josh's hand, then leaves. Josh watches him go, then takes out his cell phone. \nJOSH (INTO PHONE) Hey...I just found out I have to stay back tonight and finish off mid-term grades. It could be a while, there's a lot to go through. Don't wait up. Bye. \nEXT. PARK - NIGHT \nJosh sits on a park bench, staring into the distance. He takes out a flask of whisky, swigging from it. \nINT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT \nRenai lies in bed, staring at the ceiling. Alone. \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nRenai shuffles in, pouring herself a glass of water. Then she hears it. A low muttering. It is coming from Dalton's room. \nINT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nUnnerved, Renai peers through the open door. Josh is sitting beside Dalton's bed, reading to him. \nJOSH The men all walked down to the waters edge...and they stood there and asked the beast to come forth. And the beast roared back \"No!\". And so they dived in after it... \nEXT. LAMBERT HOME \nIn the sunlight, the house looks like a happy place. \nINT. DALTON'S BEDROOM - DAY \nDalton's face is a picture of serenity. \nA new day-shift nurse, KELLY (29), checks on his feeding tube. Renai watches from the doorway. \nKELLY You okay? \nRENAI Yeah. \nKELLY I was going to head off for an hour or so. Are you alright here? \nRENAI Of course. Anything from Dalton? \nKELLY No. I'm sorry. \nRenai nods. Her eyes brim with tears. The cracks are showing. \nKELLY (CONT'D) Keep providing him with stimuli. I've seen it work time and time again. Read to him. Even if you're doing something else, you can play him music that he likes. Don't give up. \nShe throws a scarf over her shoulder and stands. \nRENAI I won't, I just...I haven't slept much the last couple of nights. I feel like the universe is trying to see how far I can bend before I break. \nKELLY The universe picked a fight with the wrong chick. \nRENAI Thanks, Kelly. You're a saint. \nKELLY No, I'm not. I'm doing my job. I chose to be here. You didn't choose any of this. You're the strong one. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - DAY \nHe is not looking in at her...he is pacing back and forth, furiously smoking a cigarette. Back and forth, back and forth. Agitated. He has long, black, greasy hair and a grey jacket. \nEvery muscle in Renai's body freezes. She becomes a glacier. \nHer eyes are drilled to the man, unable to move. By sheer will, she manages to direct them towards the bedroom door. Opens her mouth but no words will come. Finally-- \nRENAI Jo....osh....Josh....Josh... \nShe glances back at the window. \nTHE MAN IS NOW IN THE ROOM. \nHe paces back and forth between the bed and the window, just as he was outside, ignoring Renai. Smoking like a fiend. \nAnd then, suddenly, he stops pacing. Looks up. Straight at Renai - as if just realizing she was there. \nFor a moment their eyes are locked in silence... \n...and then the man's face contorts in anger and he CHARGES towards her, arms outstretched, GROWLING in fury. \nMAN DON'T YOU FUCKING DARE! \nRenai lets out a SHRIEK of terror that could strip paint. A cry from the depths of her soul. \nShe propels herself backward, falling off the bed and scrambling back into the corner. \nJosh CHARGES into the room, flicking on the light-- \n--seeing only Renai, huddled in the corner, screaming. \nJOSH What is it? What is it?! \nRenai is incoherent. She cannot stop screaming. Josh grabs her by the shoulders. \nJOSH (CONT'D) Renai, what is wrong?! \nRENAI The man -- he was there -- he tried to -- there was a man there!!! \nFoster runs into the room, visibly terrified. He sees his mother and instantly begins crying. He runs to his dad, holding onto his leg. \nIn the background, Cali begins crying, her screams contributing to an overwhelming din. \nJOSH There's no one here. \nRENAI I saw somebody! \nJOSH There's no one here. \nRENAI Don't you dare not believe me! \nJOSH I believe you, okay? I just don't know what you want me to do. \nRENAI I want you to tell me that we can leave this house. I will not spend one more night here. I wanna leave, I wanna go! \nFOSTER I don't want the man to get me. \nThe realization that her child is terrified quiets Renai. \nAll is suddenly silent, save for the cries of Cali in the background. Josh holds his son tight. \nJOSH You're okay, buddy. I've got you. \nHe and Renai exchange a look. \nRENAI I'm sorry. (BEAT) I can't...I want to leave this house. I can't be here anymore. \nJOSH To move now would be...we would have to rent somewhere. It's not-- \nRENAI Please, Josh. \nAn agreement passes between them. \nFADE TO BLACK. \nEXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY \nA moving truck is parked outside an average suburban home. \nMovers mill about, hauling boxes and couches. \nINT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - DAY \nRenai unpacks boxes. An elderly woman, LORRAINE (65), helps to unpack. This is Josh's mother. She has a curt, disapproving manner about her that doesn't always make her easy to love. \nShe is actually moving more quickly than Renai, who groans as if her back were aching as she stoops down to pick up books. \nRENAI Lorraine, you shouldn't have to do any of this. Sit down. \nWith a sudden POP, the record starts skipping. \nBump...bump...bump... \nRenai shuts off the water, heading back to the living room. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nShe marches in, annoyed. \nThen freezes. \nHer bookshelf is empty. The books that once sat on it are now scattered across the floor. \nBump...bump...bump... \nRenai scans the books. THEN SHE HEARS it... \nGiggling. \nShe pivots her head towards the darkened hallway. There, she sees a child, hidden in shadow, standing in the hall. Staring at her. \nBump...bump...bump... \nRenai doesn't move. Doesn't breathe. \nAnd then suddenly, the child turns and runs down the hall, disappearing into Dalton's bedroom. \nRENAI Oh my God, Dalton...no... \nSummoning every ounce of strength, Renai troops down the hall towards Dalton's room. \nINT. DALTON'S BEDROOM - DAY \nRenai pushes the door open. \nDalton lies in the center of the room on his gurney. The only sound is his breathing. \nRenai surveys the room. It is empty. \nBump...bump...bump... \nShe steps inside, glancing over at a cabinet. In the foot- high space beneath it, a small white shoe protrudes slightly. \nA child's shoe. \nHeart pounding, Renai bends down, peering into the darkness under the cabinet. \nBump...bump...bump... \nThe shoe does not have a foot in it. It is simply a discarded shoe. There is no one under the cabinet. \nBANG!!! BA G \nThe cabinet doors EXPLODE open as the child bursts out, giggling. Only we see that it is not a child. \nIt is a DWARF. A man in child's clothing. The dwarf runs past Renai as she LEAPS back. He runs out of the room, giggling. All is quiet again. \nBump...bump...bump... \nRenai gets up, unsure of what to do. Numb with terror. \nSUDDENLY-- the record pitches back to life, the volume startling. Renai JOLTS, falling backwards. \nINT. CLASSROOM, FORRESTER HIGH SCHOOL - NIGHT \nA darkened class room. \nAn older janitor, NED (68), shoulders the door open, carrying a mop. He STARTS when he sees Josh, sitting at his desk in the pale light of a desk lamp. Alone. \nNED Josh...didn't see you there. \nJOSH Sorry to scare you. \nNED What are you up to this late? \nJosh holds up his flask of whisky. He's a bit soused. \nJOSH Where did all the bartenders who listen to your troubles go, Ned? \nNed nods sagely. He sets down his mop and grabs a chair, sitting in front of Josh with a sigh. He takes the flask. \nNED Never drink alone. If you take the dirty jokes out of drunkenness, all you're left with is the self loathing. \nHe downs a hit from the flask, then hands it back. \nJOSH I don't need whisky for that. \nJOSH Are you kidding me? (TO LORRAINE) Was this your idea? \nRENAI No. It was mine. \nJOSH You've never been to a church in your life. Now you're inviting a priest into our home? I feel like I don't even know you right now. \nRENAI I'm scared. \nJOSH This is a fantasy, and you need a therapist, not a member of the clergy. \nRENAI (TO LORRAINE) I told you... \nLORRAINE What's happening to Renai is real. I've seen it for myself. (BEAT) I came here today because last night I had a dream about this place. \nINT. KITCHEN, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT \nWe are FLOATING through the corridor, looking through Lorraine's POV. \nWe are inside her dream. \nLORRAINE (V.O.) I was in this house...but it was late at night. \nThe POV keeps moving, out of the kitchen and into the hall. \nLORRAINE (V.O.) (CONT'D) I tried to be quiet. I didn't want to wake anybody. I was afraid. \nThe POV floats down the hall, reaching a door. The door opens, revealing Josh and Renai, sleeping. \nLORRAINE (V.O.) (CONT'D) I looked into your bedroom. You were both asleep. \nThe POV keeps moving down the hall. \nLORRAINE (V.O.) (CONT'D) I knew that I was asleep in the dream...but I could feel that someone was awake in the house. \nWe keep pushing on, reaching the door to Dalton's room. \nLORRAINE (V.O.) (CONT'D) I went into Dalton's room. \nThe door pushes open. In the dark, we can see Dalton, in bed. \nLORRAINE (V.O.) (CONT'D) There was someone in there with him. \nThe POV turns to see a DARK FIGURE, standing in the corner. \nLORRAINE (V.O.) (CONT'D) A man was standing in the corner of the room. (MORE) \nLORRAINE (V.O.) (CONT'D) I asked him who he was...he said he was a visitor. I asked him what he wanted...he said Dalton. \nINT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - DAY \nLorraine is clearly unsettled by the dream. \nLORRAINE I can still hear that voice. \nShe looks up at Josh - and SCREAMS! \nOver Josh's shoulder, crouched down behind the couch and peeking up over the armrest at Lorraine, is a DIABOLICAL FIGURE. His face is PURE RED with smeared lipstick. His scalp is completely bald, yet tufts of hair dangle above his ears. Other than his face, his skin is charcoal black. \nLorraine recoils back, utterly petrified. \nJOSH What is it? \nLorraine stares eerily into his eyes. Frozen. \nLORRAINE He's here. \nRenai looks to Josh, who is at a total loss. She is crying. \nRENAI Help us... \nHis anger fades and he steps over and takes her in his arms. \nJOSH I don't know how. \nLORRAINE I know somebody who can help...if you're willing to ask for it. \nEXT. NEW HOUSE - DAY \nA battered van is parked in the driveway of the house. \nINT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - DAY \nRenai and Josh stand in front of two men. They are silent. \nThe shorter one is a wiry young man who looks like he spends most of his time in dark rooms. Not a member of the beach volleyball team. This is SPECS (32). \nThe other is TUCKER (33), a larger man with scruffy facial hair. He is eating a Hot Pocket. \nSpecs and Tucker mill around the room. Tucker is carrying a small electronic device. He holds it against the wall. \nJOSH What is that? \nTUCKER Tri-field meter. It measures DC fields and the natural electro magnetic environment. \nSPECS Sometimes old wiring can leak into the atmosphere. It can cause hallucinations, changes in energy. \nTUCKER Yeah. It's a little more complicated than that, but, you know, you get the general idea. \nSPECS It's basically that. \nTUCKER Not really, but whatever. \nSPECS (TO JOSH) The tech stuff's not relevant to you anyway. \nTUCKER It's very relevant, but it's all good. \nINT. CORRIDOR, NEW HOUSE - LATER \nTucker edges into the corridor. He switches out the light, then takes what looks like a modified VIEW-MASTER TOY out of his shoulder bag, holding it up to his eyes. \nHe stalks down the corridor with it. All is quiet. \nTUCKER'S POV THROUGH VIEWMASTER - different filters highlight different degrees of UV light. Each slide changes the readings. \nHe approaches the grandfather clock. Another slide clicks into place - showing us TWO FIGURES. Standing beside the clock. \nIn the negative light, they look like females. \nTucker lowers the device. There is no one there. \nINT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - SAME TIME \nSpecs packs up the video equipment, babbling to Josh and Renai. \nSPECS Epilepsy in one of the children mostly. It's very common. If we approach things academically, it lets us find the genuinely interesting cases. \nTucker backs into the room. Very slowly. He is afraid. \nTUCKER I think we can call Elise now... \nINT. FRONT DOOR, NEW HOUSE - EARLY EVENING \nJosh opens the door to see an elderly woman, ELISE RAINIER (73), who despite her years maintains a sprightly energy. \nThere is absolutely nothing morbid or dour about her. \nJOSH Mrs. Rainier? \nELISE No, my mother couldn't come, it's just me. Elise. You must be Lorraine's son? You've grown since I last saw you. \nJOSH Last saw me? \nELISE Your mother and I have been friends for a long time. \nElise steps inside. Renai, Tucker and Specs gather around her. Everyone becomes very subservient, like the Queen just arrived. \nELISE (CONT'D) (re Specs and Tucker) They're very good assistants but I can't get them to dress any better. \nRENAI Hi. I'm Renai. \nELISE Pleased to meet you. I'm Elise. \nElise takes her hat off and scans the room, taking a deep breath. Tucker jabbers, eager to please. \nTUCKER We took Tri-field and EMF readings of the whole house. All the wiring, alarm clocks, radios, toasters, TV, record player, fuse box. Nothing went off the charts. \nELISE And the previous home? \nTucker and Specs look at each other. Oh shit. \nSPECS Tucker hadn't monitored that yet. I could jump on that this afternoon if you like? Make up for lost time. \nTUCKER Yeah, but who would work the equipment? I'll need to be there. You know what, don't even sweat it. I'll make myself available. \nELISE No, that's fine, gentlemen. \nShe stares up at the ceiling, as if seeing something they can't. \nELISE (CONT'D) I don't think bad wiring is the problem here. \nShe drifts over to the bookshelf, her hand landing on the stack of photo albums Renai looked through in the opening scene. \nELISE (CONT'D) Hmm. \nRenai and Josh exchange a look. \nRENAI What is it? What do you see? \nElise cups her hand over her mouth and whispers to Specs, keeping her eyes GLUED to the far corner of the ceiling. We cannot hear what she is whispering. \nHand shaking, Specs feverishly starts to sketch. We cannot see what he is drawing. \nRENAI (CONT'D) What do you see?! \nThe strokes of Specs' pencil become faster and rougher, keeping up with Elise's whispers. Sweat dots his forehead. \nTucker glances at the drawing and steps back instinctively. He holds up his Viewmaster. \nPOV THROUGH VIEWMASTER - we see the far corner of the ceiling change color as Tucker rotates the lenses inside...but nothing out of the ordinary appears. Just a ceiling. \nRENAI (CONT'D) Tell me! \nSuddenly, Renai charges forward, snatching the sketch book. \nThe drawing is of a hideous form - crouched in the corner of the ceiling, staring down at Dalton below. It is the RED- FACED DEMON Lorraine saw earlier. \nHis naked body is charcoal black...whilst also strangely translucent, the veins visible underneath the flesh. A corpulent stomach juts out, as if he were pregnant. \nTerrified, Renai flicks on the light -- \n-- revealing nothing but an ordinary ceiling. \nINT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - DAY \nElise holds court in the living room. \nRenai and Josh hold each other, struggling to comprehend it all. \nELISE I'm not sure if you are ready to hear this yet...but unfortunately I can't waste any time easing you into it. There is no time left. \nShe takes a deep breath, preparing herself. \nELISE (CONT'D) I want you to know that this is what I believe and it may contradict a previous medical diagnosis. However, you called me here and I am taking that as an acceptance of my readings. \nRENAI Go on. \nELISE Your son...is not in a coma. His physical body is here, but his spiritual body is not. (BEAT) The reason these disturbances followed you to a new home is because...it is not the house that is haunted. It is your son. \nThis is too much for Josh. Renai, however, wants to listen. \nRENAI I don't understand... \nElise considers what she is about to say carefully. \nELISE Have you ever heard of astral projection? \nRENAI Out of body experiences? \nElise nods. \nELISE I call them travellers. These are people with the ability to leave their physical body and travel to different places in an astral form. To some degree, we all have the ability to do it...but most of us subconsciously suppress it or don't know how to access it. \nJosh shakes his head, agitated. Renai leans forward, desperate for an answer to her terror. \nELISE (CONT'D) Dalton is...a very accomplished astral projector. He has been since he was very young. He's not afraid of his ability. And that lack of fear has led him to travel too far and become lost... \nRENAI Lost? Lost where? \nElise gazes up at the ceiling, as if looking into another world. \nELISE In The Further. \nRENAI What do you mean? \nELISE The Further is that place beyond our perception, beyond our understanding of the physical world that we can see and touch. It is a place without clocks or measurements, without past or future...an infinite realm that holds all of our dreams...and all of our nightmares. \nShe turns to look at them. \nELISE (CONT'D) That is where Dalton is. \nRenai cries, unprepared for what she is hearing. \nELISE (CONT'D) The problem is that with his astral body gone, he has left a physical body with us. An empty vessel. \nJosh can't meet her gaze. \nELISE (CONT'D) And there are entities that know this. They can smell it - the chance to live again. That is why they have gathered around him. \nRENAI How many are there? \nELISE There are five benevolent spirits. Five different entities for whom Dalton has become a most prized possession. They are trying to get inside his physical body...and they get closer with each passing day. \nHer words hang in the air like gunsmoke. Pure fear courses through Josh's eyes. He fidgets, agitated. \nINT. MASTER BEDROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT \nJosh lies beside Renai, who is sleeping. He is wide awake, staring at the ceiling. \nHe gets out of bed. \nINT. DALTON'S BEDROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe door opens. \nAll is mute as Josh enters, skulking carefully through the darkness. \nThe curtains lull in the slightest of breezes. \nJosh stands over Dalton. \nHe stares down at his sons body, then lets his gaze drift around the room...past the CLOSET, past the DRAWINGS pinned to the wall and the TOYBOX...all the way to the CORNER of the ceiling that Elise was so frightened of. Josh's eyes drill into the shadows. \nIs there something waiting there? \nFinally, Josh sits down beside Dalton. He grips his sons hand. \nJOSH Where are you? Where did you go? (BEAT) Can you hear me? I'm begging you to show me that you can hear me...I don't know how to help you. Please tell me what to do. \nJosh's torment fills the air...but Dalton doesn't move. \nJOSH (CONT'D) Please God, please help me...give me my son back. I will do anything just to have him back. \nJosh studies Dalton's face for a response. Nothing. Not a twitch. He collapses forward onto Dalton. Holding him tight. \nJOSH (CONT'D) I need him back. I need him to show me that he can hear me. Please... \nFor a moment, all we can hear is Josh's breathing. \nThen...something happens. Something Josh doesn't see. \nDalton's face twitches. It is a very slight movement. This movement is followed by something that is hard to miss-- \nOne of the tacks pinning one of Dalton's drawings to the wall begins to wind loose. \nIt pops free, shooting across the room like a kernel of popcorn...followed by another tack. \nThe second tack lands in Josh's lap. Puzzled, he picks it up, examining it. He looks up, his eye drawn to the picture on the wall. \nWith total astonishment, he sees the two remaining tacks works themselves free, popping out of the wall. \nThe drawing floats down to the ground. \nJosh stoops down, picking it up. \nIt is a drawing split into two halves. The left half is a self portrait of Dalton, lying in bed, looking down from above. \nThe right half is a depiction of outer space - squiggly stars and bloated planets. \nDalton has drawn another version of himself on this side, flying above the house with another man. \nAt the bottom of the first drawing, Dalton has written `Last night I watched myself sleep'. \nA tear falls down Josh's face. He begins to cry. Deep and painful tears he has long pent up. \nBeneath the second drawing, Dalton has written `Then I flew away.' \nINT. MASTER BEDROOM, NEW HOUSE - EARLY MORNING \nRenai's eyes flutter open. She glances over. No one is there. \nINT. KITCHEN, NEW HOUSE - EARLY MORNING \nRenai shuffles into the kitchen. \nJosh is sitting at the kitchen table, staring at Dalton's drawing. He hasn't slept and looks it. He looks up at her. \nJOSH Okay. \nRenai approaches Josh and they hug...holding on for dear life. \nEXT. NEW HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe Lambert house is lit from within. Like a Jack-O-Lantern. \nINT. DALTON'S ROOM - NIGHT \nAction stations. \nTucker sets up two stills camera's around Dalton's room, zipping back and forth between the two tripods. Specs opens up a kit, taking out his notepad and a pencil. \nA small, circular table has been set up, adjacent to Dalton's bed. Elise sits at the table, flanked on either side by Josh and Renai. \ndalton are you there? dalton? An agonizing ocean of silence...then this furious scrawl: \nlisten to me you filthy whore he isnt here you should not have come here you fucking bitch i will rip your cunt apart and eat the fucking innards that spill forth from it i HAVESEENYOUIKNOWWHOYOUAREBUTYOUANDTHE Specs writing begins to SHRED the paper as he writes furiously, the scrawl getting out of control. Sweat flies from his forehead as he struggles to get it all down. \nSuddenly a PIERCING SCREAM blasts through the microphone and he jerks it away from his ear - then looks over at Elise. \nWith UTTER DREAD, he sees that she is NO LONGER WEARING THE MASK. She has taken it off and is panting heavily. \nThe scream continues through the mic, audible to everyone...then peters out. \nShocked silence follows. \nJosh glances over at Dalton's bed. \nHe is not in it. \nStunned, Josh turns back to the table-- \n--TO SEE DALTON SITTING NEXT TO HIM. STARING AT HIM. \nHis heart leaps out of his skin and so does Renai's as they both turn towards Dalton. Their son. \nDalton stares at them...not a trace of emotion on his face. \nThen he reaches up and grips his bottom jaw with both hands, wrenching it downwards with almighty force and BREAKING HIS OWN JAW. \nRenai SCREAMS into the abyss as Dalton BELLOWS at them, spit flying from his throat, his tongue hanging down over his dislocated jaw. \nHe stamps his foot and the table - and everyone sitting at it, Renai, Josh and Elise - go flying backwards as if pushed by a hurricane, smashing into the wall with crushing power. \nWe realize that Dalton was not sitting at the table, but squatting down awkwardly. Painfully. \nHe stands up, then steps forward. As Josh and Renai watch, his KNEE begins to BEND BACKWARDS, the tendons stretching and snapping, the knee bending in the opposite direction. \nHis other knee follows and he steps forward - both knees bending back. \nSpecs is rigid in his chair, rooted to the spot, notepad still in hand. When he looks up at Dalton, the flashlight under his chin shines in Dalton's eyes. \nDalton ROARS and advances forward - SLAPPING Specs with the force of ten men. Specs reels backwards, hitting the wall, smashing his head and crumpling like paper. \nElise stands to face Dalton. The CAMERA FLASH goes off again, lighting the darkened room for a split second and showing Elise the lipstick-smeared face of a demon instead of Dalton's face. \nTucker SHRINKS BACK as he captures all this with the video camera. \nDalton steps forward again and Elise CHARGES at him, grabbing Dalton by the hair. \nELISE Leave this vessel! Leave this vessel! \nDalton BELLOWS again - a howl so course and ungodly that it seems ripped straight from the bowels of Lucifer himself. \nELISE (CONT'D) LEAVE THIS VESSEL! \nDalton FLIES backwards, hitting the corner of the wall and then CLIMBING IT, arcing his body into the far corner of the ceiling like an expert contortionist. \nHe hisses at them as the CAMERA FLASH fires AGAIN AND AGAIN, showing them split second frames of the red faced CREATURE. \nELISE (CONT'D) Leave this earthly body! \nDalton shrieks again and somehow the force of the cry knocks Elise down. \nThe room begins to shake. \nBooks fly. \nThe closet doors burst open. \nWith terror, Elise looks over and sees several figures peering out from within the closet. \nTwo are the women that Specs' drew. Another is a small man, dressed like a child. \nThey stare out at Elise, their eyes glinting in the dark. \nElise turns to see Josh. The camera flash STROBES repeatedly and gives us split-second glimpses of an OLD WOMAN, dressed in Victorian era garb - standing directly behind Josh. \nAnd then, with absolute fear, Renai sees the LONG HAIRED MAN standing over her. He SCREAMS at her and pushes her against the wall, licking her. She cries out, terrified. \nWith the spirit world, crashing in around her, Elise pulls herself off the floor and yells again. \nELISE (CONT'D) Leave his body! \nDalton suddenly SPASMS, dropping out of the corner and hitting the floor like a rag doll dropped off a bridge. \nELISE (CONT'D) The lights! \nTerrified, Specs' scrambles over to the corner, flicking the light switch. The room is instantly flooded with light. \nThe room has stopped shaking. The screaming has stopped. \nJOSH What are you talking about? \nLorraine can't go on. Elise steps in. \nELISE It's no accident that your son is such a gifted traveller. The ability was handed down to him. (BEAT) By his father. \nFLASHCUT TO: \nINT. DARKENED BEDROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK \nWe have returned to the opening scene. \nWe are looking down on a sleeping child. Chest rising and falling with each breath. \nThis is JOSH as a child. \nWe move away from him, exploring the dark room. \nFLASHCUT TO: \nINT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT - PRESENT \nTucker and Specs enter the room, lingering at the back. \nJOSH No...I've never...done that before. \nLORRAINE When you were about eight...you suffered night terrors. Awful fits of pure fear. You were terrified of an old woman who you said would come to visit you at night. \nFLASHCUT TO: \nINT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT - FLASHBACK \nAgain we return to the opening scene...floating down a long hallway. \nA window at the end of the hall enlarges as we approach. \nSomeone is standing in front of it. \nThe murky silhouette of the figure turns and walks away. We follow it, tentative. Turning a corner, we see the figure. Standing in a doorway. \nNow we can make out the edges of the figure. It is an old woman. Hair in a Victorian bun. A corseted dress. \nIT IS THE SAME OLD WOMAN THAT ELISE SAW. \nOLD WOMAN Let me in. \nFLASHCUT TO: \nINT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT \nLorraine closes her eyes, struggling to go on. \nLORRAINE I dismissed your stories. Told you to grow up. (BEAT) Then I saw her for myself. \nShe looks to Elise, who nods. \nHand trembling, Lorraine retrieves a packet from within her coat. The paper is yellowing. Faded. Soaked from the rain. \nLorraine hands the packet to Josh, who is dumbfounded. \nRenai peers over Josh's shoulder, at a Polaroid of a boy, about nine years old, sitting on a couch. Early 70s period. \nIt is a Young Josh. Behind him is the BLURRED OUTLINE OF A FIGURE. \nJosh runs his finger over the shadow. His heart rate speeds up. An old memory is coming back to him. \nLORRAINE (CONT'D) At first, I thought it was a camera problem. Then I saw her again. \nJosh flips to the next photo - it is another faded frame of Josh as a youngster. This time he stands in an old kitchen. \nOnce again, there is a figure behind him - clearer this time, but still hidden in silhouette. A step closer to Josh. \nJosh flips to the next picture. A BLACK AND WHITE shot of himself as a young boy, lying in bed. \nWith dread, Josh sees the unmistakable features of an OLD WOMAN, crouching beside his bed. Staring at him. \nLORRAINE (CONT'D) In each photo, she got closer and closer to you... \nJosh flips to the next picture - in this one, Young Josh is standing by a car. \nBehind him, the details of the Old Woman's dress are visible. Her arm is extended...reaching out for Josh's neck. \nRenai's hand flies to her mouth. \nLORRAINE (CONT'D) Finally, I was so scared, I called Elise. \nSweat pours down Josh's brow. \nHe realizes he knows where he is. He is in his OLD HOUSE. An alternate world version of it. \nThe lighting is different - it's darker. There are no signs of life. Water drips somewhere. \nJosh stumbles forward, seeing an open door. \nINT. LIVING ROOM, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS \nJosh slinks into a darkened and dilapidated living room. \nThere are THREE PEOPLE in here - a middle aged woman, a middle aged man and a young girl. They are all FROZEN, standing in place as if someone had hit the pause button on their life. \nThe woman is in the middle of ironing. The man is sitting in an arm chair reading a newspaper. The girl is lying on the floor. \nThe whole scene looks like a macabre `Leave It To Beaver' tableau - a cheerful family frozen in time. \nJosh steps closer to the mother... \n...hairs prickling up on his neck when he sees her BLINK. Her body moves slightly. She is not frozen - merely playing statues. Like a street performer keeping as still as possible. \nJosh turns to the father. He is the same. His hand shakes, struggling to hold the newspaper in place. \nHe backs away from them, truly creeped out. His back hits a window and he turns, peering through the glass down at the street below. \nA figure, hidden in silhouette, is gazing up at him. \nINT. KITCHEN, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS \nJosh stalks into a kitchen off the living room. A weathered door is adjacent to the kitchen. \nThe door is ajar. \nThrough it, Josh can see somebodies leg. \nJosh approaches the door, prodding it open gently with his finger. \nIt is a bedroom. A tattered cot sits against the wall. A YOUNG MAN (17) sits on the cot, holding a rifle. Like the others, he is trying to be completely still, as if on pause. \nHe is having more trouble than the family, trembling slightly. \nJOSH I'm looking for my son, Dalton. \nThe boy does not look up. Does not move. \nJosh retreats, scanning the kitchen. There are soiled pots in the sink. Rotting food, but no bugs. Josh turns the faucet but no water comes forth. \nWhen he turns back, the YOUNG MAN is gone. No longer in his bedroom. \nJosh glances back at the living room. \nThe Young Man is now standing inside the living room. \nAgain, he is frozen. Holding his rifle. Looking down at his family, who are now splayed out on the carpet, soaked in BLOOD. \nEach of them has a bullet hole in their head. \nRepulsed, Josh tip-toes past them. He looks down at the mother - a bullet wound in the center of her chest. \nShe blinks...still playing dead. \nINT. CORRIDOR, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS \nMore corridors disappearing into darkness. \nJosh wrenches his hair in frustration. He boils over, screaming at the top of his lungs. \nJOSH DALTON!!!! WHERE ARE YOU?!!! \nHis cry recedes into nothingness. \nDALTON (O.S.) Dad.... \nHe heard that. Excited, he spins around, trying to determine where it came from. \nAs he does, he sees that the entire dead family is now gathered at the door to the living room. Watching him. \nHe summons all his strength and starts running, backing away from them. \nHe drives himself to move faster and faster. \nJOSH DALTON! \nDALTON (O.S.) Dad...help me... \nJOSH DALTON!! \nA figure suddenly appears at the end of the hallway. \nThe creature daubs RED LIPSTICK onto its face, arching forward, glaring into the mirror, caking the make-up on. \nThe room is littered with hundreds of discarded CHILDREN'S TOYS - teddy bears, stuffed animals, dolls (including one white-faced, black-haired doll we recognize). They are scattered about like bones, collecting dust in the shadows. \nSuddenly the creature stops what it is doing. It sees something in the mirror. \nWhat it sees is Josh. \nINT. BALLROOM, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS \nWith horror, Josh watches as the Red-Faced Man stands up and staggers to the door, peering through the crack at him. \nJosh wrestles to free Dalton's leg from the chain. No good. \nBehind them the Red Faced Man opens the door. A rage unknown to humans is building up inside the creature. He hisses. \nDALTON Help me, dad...take this off me... \nThe creature steps closer. Taking his time. Drool seeping from his mouth with each drunken, wayward lope. \nJOSH You're not really here. You're asleep in your bed in our home. Just stand up. \nDALTON He's going to hurt me again... \nJOSH This isn't real. You can do this. \nDALTON He's coming! \nJOSH Just stand up! \nDalton does - and suddenly finds that the chain is no longer attached to his foot. \nThe Red Faced Man ROARS and the power of his breath sends them FLYING BACK. \nRED-FACED MAN This...issssss....real! \nJosh smashes his head on a pillar, blood leaking from his head. The power of this demon far outweighs the others. \nRED-FACED MAN (CONT'D) That...issss...my....boy! \nJosh scrambles to his feet and snatches up Dalton, carrying him to the door as the Red Faced Man pursues. \nINT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT - OUR WORLD \nJosh convulses in the chair, choking. \nRENAI Help him! \nINT. CORRIDOR, THE FURTHER \nJosh surges down a corridor, carrying Dalton. \nThe Red-Faced Man hobbles up behind them, his rasping wheeze growing in volume. \nRED-FACED MAN You're here now! With ussss! \nJosh stampedes through the front door of the house - but instead of the street, he is facing another corridor. \nThey spill into the second corridor, running again, racing past rows and rows of doors. \nINT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT - OUR WORLD \nJosh twitches in his chair, sweat beading on his forehead. \nJOSH (MOANING) ....ome....onnnnn... \nElise paces in front of him. \nELISE They've made contact. I know it. He's found your son. \nRENAI What happens now? \nELISE We need them to come back. We need him to find us. \nTucker's equipment begins to shake on the table. The hanging light above them quivers as if an earthquake were rattling it. \nA force is building in the room. \nINT. CORRIDOR, THE FURTHER \nAs Josh and Dalton streak down the corridor, each door opens and a different figure staggers out. \nGrotesque figures...the solemn dead. Pale skin, hollow eyes. Their dead eyes drill into Josh's soul. \nThey want what he has - life. \nThey begin running - chasing Josh. Dozens of them. \nShe leers at Josh through the window of the basement, her visage spookily flecked in candlelight. \nJosh is transfixed. \nDALTON (CONT'D) Come on, dad! Come on! \nJOSH Go! I'm right behind you! \nDalton charges ahead as Josh glares back at this face from his past. \nJOSH (CONT'D) You...what do you want from me? \nThe old woman's eerily unblinking gaze cuts through Josh. A long dormant rage BOILS OVER inside him. He approaches the window, vomiting fury at her. \nJOSH (CONT'D) Get the fuck away from me! I'm not scared of you, just leave me alone! Get away from me! \nThe old woman's lips protract to unveil a yellow graveyard of molars. A smile to buckle the steeliest nerve. \nShe raises a lit candle to her lips. \nShe snuffs out the plume with a single puff...plunging the basement into darkness. \nINT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - SAME TIME \nSpecs staggers back as the skeletal figures emerging from the cabinets ambulate into the living room, surrounding Josh. \nRENAI (TO JOSH) Find us! \nELISE (TO SPECS) Check on the boy! \nSpecs sprints out of the room. \nINT. CORRIDOR, LAMBERT HOME, THE FURTHER \nWe are now locked into a POV shot, pushing down the corridor of the Lambert's NEW HOUSE. The scene of the trance. \nOur POV is bee-lining for Dalton's bedroom. \nINT. BASEMENT, LAMBERT HOME, THE FURTHER \nIn another POV shot, we SURGE up the basement stairs. \nINT. CORRIDOR, NEW HOUSE, THE FURTHER \nOur POV is only a few yards from Dalton's bedroom door. \nThe Red-Faced Man appears at the opposite end of the hall. Malevolent. Cruel. \nHe SCREAMS and flits towards us. \nThe POV keeps going, hitting the bedroom door and FLINGING IT OPEN - seeing DALTON'S BODY sleeping inside. \nWe SOAR towards it, getting closer-- \nINT. DALTON'S BEDROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT - OUR WORLD \nSpecs stands over Dalton's body. \nSUDDENLY - Dalton shudders, his legs spasm. His eyes FLICK open and he SUCKS IN A HUGE BREATH. \nSPECS He's awake! \nDalton sits up, panting. Renai charges into the room. He looks at her, registering her appearance. \nDALTON Mom... \nRenai literally throws herself at him, wrapping her arms around his body. No words can express. \nRenai scoops him up, carrying him out of the bedroom. \nINT. CORRIDOR, NEW HOUSE, THE FURTHER \nThe second POV whooshes down the corridor, zeroing in on the living room. \nINT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS \nA scene of desperation. \nElise leans into Josh's face. \nThe living room is now filled with the CREEPING FORMS of the souls who crawled out from within the drawers. All of them marching towards Josh. \nELISE Find me, Josh! Now! Wake up! \nThe closest entity reaches out with gnarled fingers and is almost touching Josh-- \nINT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE, THE FURTHER \n", "test1_input": "FOSTER It's too small. \nRENAI Make it work. (INTO PHONE) Speak to an agent. Speak to an agent. Speak to an agent. \nFoster slumps on the floor, pouring cereal and overflowing milk into the cup. A baby girl in a high chair, CALI (2), squeals. \nINT. BATHROOM, LAMBERT HOME - MORNING \nJOSH LAMBERT (37) gapes into the mirror, face covered in soap. \nHe washes it off. Now he's awake we see that he is a handsome, clean-cut guy - a former high school nerd who got revenge by growing into his body. \nHe sorts through a box labelled JOSH'S BATHROOM STUFF. \nHe takes out two bottles - TONER and MOISTURIZER. He dabs the toner on, then smooths the moisturizer into his forehead and around his eyes. \nHe suddenly notices a grey hair. Looks mortified. \nJOSH (Michael Corleone voice) Every time I think I've pulled you out...you grow back in. \nHe plucks it out, wincing melodramatically. \nJOSH (CONT'D) Ouch! \nINT. KITCHEN, LAMBERT HOME - MORNING \nJosh strides in, tie hanging open around his neck. Renai is still on the phone. Josh points to his tie. \nRENAI Well, I'd like to keep the old number if I could. (TO JOSH) You really need to learn how to do this, honey. \nShe threads the tie into a knot for him. \nJOSH (TO FOSTER) Don't eat on the floor, buddy. \nFoster stays where he is, slurping cereal from the cup. Dalton is playing a handheld videogame. Intensely focused. \nRENAI (INTO PHONE) Okay, well, please let me know by the end of today, I have to give the number out. Thank you. \nShe hangs up, pissed. \nRENAI (CONT'D) Foster, get up. Now. \nFoster frowns and obeys. \nJOSH (TO RENAI) How come you were up so early? Was Cali crying? \nRENAI You woke me up. \nJOSH What do you mean? \nRENAI You were snoring. \nJOSH No I wasn't. \nRENAI Yes you were. \nJOSH I don't snore. \nRENAI Yes you do. \nJOSH My father snored. I do not snore. \nRENAI How would you know what you do? You're asleep. \nRenai marches out of the room. Dalton's game unit beeps loudly and he pumps his fist. \nDALTON Yes! I made it to the last level! Invisiworld! \nEver amiable, Josh high five's his son. \nJOSH Good one, champ. (BEAT) I don't snore, do I? \nINT. LIVING ROOM, LAMBERT HOME - CONTINUOUS \nRenai sees that all the books she unpacked earlier are now scattered across the floor of the living room. \nRENAI Where are my bleeping pills? \nINT. KITCHEN, LAMBERT HOME - CONTINUOUS \nRenai charges in. Josh snatches an apple out of a fruit bowl, biting into it. He quickly gags and spits it out into the sink. \nJOSH What the heck is this? Wax?! \nRENAI Yes. \nJOSH Let me get this straight - we have no actual fruit but we have wax fruit? \n", "test1_true": "JOSH That is dangerous. It could kill one of our kids. \nRENAI Where are my pills, Josh? \nJOSH Probably where you left them, Renai. \nShe finds them on the counter, snatching them up. \nJOSH (CONT'D) See. \nRENAI That's not where I left them. \nDALTON Mom, I need my lunch. \nRENAI Oh, geez. Look, just...take last night's dinner. \nShe opens the fridge. It is bare except for a box of sushi. \nDALTON Sushi? Aw, that's weirdo food. \nRENAI It's all we have. Just for today, honey. \nJOSH Check it first, Dalton. It's probably made out of Styrofoam. \nRENAI (TO DALTON) And while I've got you, if you're going to look at my books, please don't leave them all over the floor. \nDALTON I didn't touch your books. \nJosh streaks past, kissing Renai on the cheek. \nJOSH I gotta go. \nRENAI Are you taking the boys to school? \nJOSH No time. \nRENAI Well can you pick them up after school? \nJOSH Not today. \nRENAI But I have stuff I wanted to... \nShe trails off. He's gone. Foster BURPS. Loudly. \nFOSTER Can I have another cup, mom? \nINT. CLASSROOM, FORRESTER HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nNoisy students settle into their desks. Inner city kids, mostly Hispanic. \nJosh is their teacher, scribbling on the blackboard. One student, a lanky boy, ALANSO (16), hovers near the door. \nJOSH Alanso, please sit down. \nALANSO No entiendo. \nJOSH Si\u00e9ntate, por favor. \nAlanso takes a seat. Josh is having trouble getting control. \nJOSH (CONT'D) Come on guys, quieten down. \nA pretty girl in the front, TERI, is annoyed at the class. \nTERI You better all shut up. \nShe commands respect. They do. Except for one kid. \nTHE ONE KID Just cos you're in love. \nJOSH Thank you, Teri. Today we are going to talk about Darwin. It's a city in Australia, but it's also the last name of which famous naturalist? \nMALE STUDENT # 1 Charles Darwin. \nJOSH Correct. Does anybody know what he is famous for? \nMALE STUDENT # 1 He said that people descended from monkeys. \nJOSH Half right. He wrote a seminal book that explained his theories on natural selection, and how the different species on this planet - including humans - evolved. \nALANSO I know I didn't evolve from no monkey. Shit. \nEveryone laughs. \nJOSH Humans actually have a lot in common with monkeys, or more specifically, chimpanzees. \n", "test1_id": 2928, "test2_input": "She can see him. \nELISE (SOFTLY) Now you are free. (BEAT) Keep your guide, and a steady stride...and into The Further you go. \nShe turns back to the Josh in the chair. The room seems to have darkened even more somehow. \nJosh turns and glares into the darkness of his hallway as it yawns outwards, eventually swallowed by complete blackness. \nHe is not in another world. He is in his own house. \nNOTE - The following scenes are not going to be \"movie quiet\". They will be inhumanly quiet. There will no score. Only sound scape. This is another world and should feel so. \nJosh moves forward, gliding down the hall slowly. He looks down and sees that his feet are slighty raised off the ground. \nHe is floating. \nHe moves into the darkness of the hall...past the bedroom doors and closet doors. \nAs he floats past, he scans every darkened corner for the slightest trace of movement. \nHe reaches the front door. He moves towards it and as he does it OPENS. \nEXT. THE FURTHER - NOT NIGHT OR DAY, BUT DARK \nHis street beckons beyond the door. \nJosh floats across his lawn. \nThere are no people or cars on the street...it is as desolate as a post-apocalyptic wasteland. A TOTAL ABSENCE OF LIFE. \nSome lights flicker from within the houses, but no movement or signs of human forms. Only mist. \nJosh floats an inch above the road, moving down the street. \nOne thing to notice is that there is a total lack of horizon or city scape here...Josh's immediate surroundings are visible for about one hundred yards or so...anything beyond that, in any direction, fades into blackness. As if someone were shining a giant spotlight down on him. \nINT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT - OUR WORLD \nRenai watches Josh. He is completely still...in a trance. \nHis eyelids flutter as his eyeballs probe in all directions underneath. \nELISE He's in... \nEXT. THE FURTHER - NIGHT \nJosh keeps moving, his fear registering, even in this world. \nHe looks down at his feet. \nHe is frustrated that he can't move any faster. He concentrates with fierce intensity-- \n--and then watches as his feet touch the ground. \nHe is walking. \nHe starts to move faster, gaining control of his movement. \nJOSH Dalton? \nThe sound of his voice is strangely dead - as if he were inside a soundproof recording studio. There are no walls or angles for it to bounce off. \nJOSH (CONT'D) Dalton? Where are you? \nFor a long time, there is nothing... \n...then he sees it. \nA figure...shrouded in shadow. Standing on the street corner with his back to Josh. \nJosh moves towards the figure. \nCloser. Closer. \nThe man abruptly turns the corner without looking back. \nJosh glances around the corner. There is nobody there. \nHe continues down the street. He sees a little girl. Far in the distance, but close enough to focus on. She stands and stares... \n...then turns and walks away. Gone...like an apparition. \nHe looks to his right and sees-- \n--A SHADOW. \nBehind a curtain in one of the windows, back lit by candle light. As with the others, the shadow turns away and disappears. \n", "test2_true": "INT. HOUSE - THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS \nA long corridor beckons. As with all of this world, it is dark here. \nJosh walks into the corridor, looking to his left and right into empty rooms. Living rooms and bedrooms. Devoid of life. \nThe colors are muted...the palate drained. Only REDS and BLACKS pop out. Blood and darkness. \nJosh keeps moving down the corridor. \nUp ahead, he sees a figure run past the top of the hall, ignoring Josh. \nHe presses forward, following the figure. \nJOSH Dalton? \nHe glances into an empty kitchen. Food rots on the table. \nHis footsteps have no sound as he continues on. \nJOSH (CONT'D) Dalton? \nHe passes a door that is partly open. He pushes it wide open. \nINT. SMALL ROOM, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS \nThe room is small and empty. A strange room...like a stage. \nA figure is sitting in the corner, facing the wall like a child being punished at school. \nJosh steps closer, cautious. Takes another step. \nJOSH Where is Dalton? \nHe steps closer yet again. \nHis hand reaches out to touch the figures back... \n...his fingers are almost grazing the figures shoulder. \nSoft laughter behind him. Josh glances back to look for the source. \nWhen he turns back, the FIGURE IS GONE. \nHe wheels around, seeing the small-statured figure of the DWARF that Renai encountered, stepping through the door of the room. \nINT. CORRIDOR, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS \nJosh sidles back into the corridor. His pace is sluggish, dream-like. \nFrustrated, he stops. Then turns to his left. \nSOMEONE IS RIGHT THERE IN HIS FACE. A MAN. \nThe man is not looking at him...only standing very close. His neck lolls on his shoulders...around and around. He seems stuck on a loop. He is dressed in a fifties era suit. \nJOSH Do you know where Dalton is? \nThe man doesn't acknowledge him. \nMAN Why do I have to put up with you? What a tramp. You call this a home? I work all day for this? \nHe marches away, leaving Josh standing alone. \nJosh keeps going, whirling around. He reaches a set of stairs. The stairs descend into darkness. \nJosh squints into the dark, afraid. \nJOSH Dalton? Where are you? \nThe low rumble of this place is the only reply. Josh turns to walk away. A distant voice stops him. \nDALTON (O.S.) Dad... \nJosh SNAPS back. \nThe voice drifted from out of the darkness at the bottom of the stairs. \nJosh scurries down the creaky ramp towards it. \nINT. HALLWAY, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS \nThe core of a rotten apple. The bowels of hell. \nDrenched in shadow, Josh fumbles forward into yet another corridor of this labyrinth. \n", "test2_id": 2929, "test3_input": "Like the hand of an eighty year old woman. \nShocked, she looks up at his face. \nJOSH (CONT'D) What's wrong? \nElise stands. She looks haunted. Her eyes wide and unnerved. \nELISE Nothing, I... \nShe turns away, reaching for something. \nJOSH What's the matter, Elise? \nShe spins around and lifts Tucker's camera up to her face, aiming it at him. She depresses the trigger and takes a photo of him, bathing the whole corridor in white light. \nJosh recoils back in shock. Elise lowers the camera. She is terrified. Josh suddenly LUNGES at her, slapping the camera out of her hands. \nJOSH (CONT'D) Why the fuck would you do that? Why would you do that? Why?! \nHe SLAMS her against the wall, his hands around her throat. \nElise chokes in terror, terrified of him. \nJOSH (CONT'D) You of all people! You know! Why would you do that to me when you know what you know? You bitch! \nHe abruptly stops attacking her, staggering backwards, examining his hands as if he can't believe what he's done. Seething with fury. Panting. \nElise collapses, catching her breath. \nJosh swipes a framed photo off the wall and storms away, heading down the corridor... \n...swallowed up by the darkness. \nINT. MASTER BEDROOM, NEW HOUSE - SAME TIME \nRenai furrows her brow. \nRENAI What was that? (beat; to Dalton) Stay here. \nShe gets up. \nINT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT \nRenai jogs into the living room. Sees Elise lying on the floor. \nRENAI Elise, what was that noise? \nElise simply looks up at her. The utter terror on her face is palpable. Her neck is bleeding from scratch marks. \nRENAI (CONT'D) Jesus...what happened to you? \nElise just stares, unable to speak. Her fear is contagious. \nRENAI (CONT'D) Where's Josh? (BEAT) Josh? Josh?! \nShe turns and runs into the corridor, flicking on the lights. \nThere is nobody there. \nINT. CORRIDOR, NEW HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nRenai dashes from room to room in the hallway, pitching each door open. \nEach room is empty. Josh is nowhere to be found. \nINT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - SAME TIME \nElise stares at Tucker's camera in a state of catatonic dread. \nRenai backs into the room, her own fear rising in her gut. She leans down and grabs Elise by the shoulders. \nRENAI Elise, what happened? You're scaring me, tell me where Josh is? \nElise finally looks up at her. Seeing the \"expert\" so afraid unnerves Renai. When the lion-tamer drops his whip and runs, you know the lion is vicious. \nElise opens her mouth to speak...but nothing comes out. \nInstead, she simply holds up the camera, showing Renai the digital display of the photo she took. \nWe do not see it. \nWe simply see the look of horror on Renai's face. \nFLASHCUT TO: \nINT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK \n", "test3_true": "Elise is sitting on the couch, alone. Trying to recover from the nights events. \nShe glances up when Josh approaches her. \nJOSH You introduced me to a new world. \nELISE No. You've been there before, remember? And you'll go back. (BEAT) All of us will...eventually. \nJOSH Maybe I can forget again. \nOnce again, we see him reach into his jacket, taking out the photos Lorraine gave him. \nJOSH (CONT'D) I'll start by giving these back. \nAs he hands them to Elise, she sees with fear that his hand is withered and wrinkled. \nShocked, she looks up at his face. \nJOSH (CONT'D) What's wrong? \nElise stands up, not knowing how to react. \nELISE Nothing, I... \nShe turns away, reaching for something. We see her scoop up Tucker's digital camera. \nJOSH What's the matter, Elise? \nShe spins around and lifts Tucker's camera up to her face, aiming it at him. She depresses the trigger and takes a photo of him, bathing the whole corridor in white light. \n--and in that split second, Josh is replaced by the Old Woman! \nElise lowers the camera, horrified. For a beat, the Old Woman just glares at her... \n...then she CHARGES at Elise, arms outstretched, wrapping her white hands around the soft flesh of Elise's throat. \nElise CHOKES, eyes bulging, spittle flying from her mouth, as the pale hands of the Old Woman dig into her thorax, droplets of blood running down her chest where the yellowing finger- nails have CUT IN to the flesh. \nThe Old Woman smiles - a merciless harlequin grin that mocks Elise's pain. \nShe lets Elise go, letting her drop to the floor. \nThe Old Woman turns and glares down the corridor. Something has caught her attention. A distant scream. \nINT. BATHROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe door groans open, a blade of light penetrating pitch black darkness. \nThe silhouette of the Old Woman floats ethereally into the bathroom. She steps up to the mirror, then reaches into her tattered Victorian dress and produces a candle. \nShe lights the candle with a match, holding it beneath her chin and glaring into the reflective surface of the mirror. \nInstead of seeing her own reflection though, she sees THROUGH the mirror as if it were a window. \nIn it, she can see the BASEMENT of the Lambert's previous residence. \nJosh bursts into the basement, carrying Dalton. \nDALTON Put me down, I can run! \nJosh sets Dalton down, who scampers up the stairs. \nWe are watching the same scene we saw earlier play out in the mirror. \nJosh is about to follow when he turns and spies a familiar face. He looks at the Old Woman...seeing her through the `window'. \nDALTON (CONT'D) Come on, dad! Come on! \nJOSH Go! I'm right behind you! \nDalton disappears as Josh glares at the woman. \nJOSH (CONT'D) You...what do you want from me? \nHe approaches the mirror. WE CIRCLE AROUND the Old Woman, past the mirror and THROUGH THE BATHROOM WALL, emerging on the other side in-- \nINT. BASEMENT, LAMBERT HOME, INSIDE THE FURTHER \n--the basement. \nJosh screams at the Old Woman as she stares at him through what he thinks is a window. THEY HAVE SWAPPED PLACES. He is now in The Further, and she is in our world. \nJOSH Get away the fuck away from me. I'm not scared of you, just leave me alone! Get away from me! \nWe KEEP CIRCLING, wiping past Josh's back and completing a 360 degree turn, THROUGH THE WALL and back into-- \n", "test3_id": 2930}

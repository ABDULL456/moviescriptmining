TUFFNUT (CONT'D) Get it off! Get it off! Oh! I'm hurt, I am very much hurt! Hiccup stops the Terrible Terror with the same light-patch trick he used earlier with Toothless. The tiny dragon retreats back to it's cage. The teens approach him yet again as Astrid looks on with suspicion. 
TUFFNUT (CONT'D) 
(TO ASTRID) Wow, he's better than you ever were. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. FOREST - MOMENTS LATER 
Astrid furiously hurls her axe at a nearby tree. She notices Hiccup walking by in the distance, carrying one of his trademark harnesses. She quickly tries to follow, but he loses her in the woods. She HUFFS, frustrated. 
EXT. COVE - LATER 
Hiccup straps a newly designed harness onto Toothless. With Toothless tied to a nearby post with a rope. Hiccup rides him in the air -- while stationary. Toothless looks like a giant kite tied to a tree stump. This harness seems to work. 
EXT. SKY - MOMENTS LATER 
The rope breaks and the pair CRASH into a tree. Hiccup's face is red. 
HICCUP Oh, great. 
EXT. BERK - NIGHT 
The streets are empty save for a lone Viking who crosses Hiccup's path.

VIKING Hiccup. Hiccup nods, trying to look casual. Once the coast is clear, he covertly steers Toothless into the Blacksmith's stall. Toothless PRESSES himself inside, rooting through stuff and making a racket. Astrid, walking nearby, is alerted. 
ASTRID (O.S.) Hiccup? Hiccup FREEZES. Then frantically tries to pry the ring off the saddle hook. It won't budge. 
ASTRID (CONT'D) Are you in there? Too late - she's right outside. ON ASTRID walking along the outside of the Blacksmith's. Hiccup JUMPS OUT the window and CLOSES the shutters behind him. Hiccup's harness line is stretched through the window, still attached to Toothless' saddle. 
HICCUP Astrid. Hey! Hi Astrid. Hi Astrid. Hi Astrid. 
ASTRID I normally don't care what people do, but you're acting weird. Well, weirder. Toothless spots a nearby sheep and makes a move toward it. As a result, Hiccup is suddenly PULLED TIGHT against the window shutters. He STRIKES A POSE to compensate... then gets PULLED THROUGH the shutters. They snap back in Astrid's face. Astrid reopens them and finds nothing but an empty stall. In the distance, Toothless and Hiccup slip off unseen. 
EXT. DOCKS - DAWN 
A lone, battered ship is pulled into a slip, overloaded with equally battered-looking men. They disembark to a crowd of onlookers, looking like a team of hometown heroes who just had their butts kicked. Gobber hobbles through the MUMBLING crowd to find Stoick -- last to disembark and glowering with battered pride.

VIKING Where are the other ships? 
SPITELOUT You don't want to know. Stoick lumbers past Gobber, leaving him staring at the trashed ship. 
GOBBER Well, I trust you found the nest at least? 
STOICK Not even close. 
GOBBER Ah. Excellent. Gobber follows Stoick up the ramp and snags his duffle bag with his hook appendage, sharing the burden. 
STOICK I hope you had a little more success than me. 
GOBBER Well, if by success, you mean that your parenting troubles are over with, then... yes. Stoick stops. What does that mean? A group of merry villagers rush past.

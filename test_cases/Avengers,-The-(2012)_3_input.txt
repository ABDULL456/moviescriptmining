PEPPER Oooooh. 
TONY My private elevator... 
PEPPER You mean OUR elevator? 
TONY ...was teeming with sweaty workmen. I'm going to pay for that comment about percentages in some subtle way later, aren't I? Pepper pours herself and Tony a glass of champagne. 
PEPPER Not gonna be that subtle. 
TONY I'll tell you what. Next building's gonna say 'Potts' on the tower. 
PEPPER On the lease. 
TONY ...Call your mom, can you bunk over? 
JARVIS Sir, the telephone. I'm afraid my protocols are being overwritten. 
AGENT PHIL COULSON Stark, we need to talk. Tony picks up his phone and looks into it at Coulson. 
TONY You have reached the life model decoy of Tony Stark, please leave a message. 
AGENT PHIL COULSON This is urgent. 
TONY Then leave it urgently. At that moment the elevator door opens and Coulson appears. 
TONY Security breach. 
(TO PEPPER) That's on you. 
AGENT PHIL COULSON Mr. Stark. 
PEPPER Phil! Come in. 
TONY Phil? Uh, his first name is Agent. 
PEPPER Come on in, we're celebrating. 
TONY Which is why he can't stay. 
AGENT PHIL COULSON We need you to look this over. (he holds out a file towards 
STARK) Soon as possible. 
TONY I don't like being handed things. 
PEPPER That's alright, `cause I love to be handed things. So, let's trade. She passes her glass of champagne to Coulson and takes the file from him, then takes her champagne glass back from Coulson and passes the file over to Stark. 
PEPPER Thank you. 
TONY Official consulting hours are between eight and five every other Thursday. 
AGENT PHIL COULSON This isn't a consultation. 
PEPPER Is this about The Avengers? Which I...I know nothing about. 
TONY The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I thought. And I didn't even qualify. 
PEPPER I didn't know that either. 
TONY Yeah, apparently I'm volatile, self- obsessed, don't play well with others. 
PEPPER That I did know. 
AGENT PHIL COULSON This isn't about personality profiles anymore. 
TONY Whatever. Miss Potts, got a minute? Pepper walks over to Tony who places the files into his own databases. 
TONY You know, I thought we were having a moment. 
PEPPER I was having twelve percent of a moment. This seems serious, Phil's pretty shaken. 
TONY How did you notice? Why is he Phil? 
PEPPER What is all of this?

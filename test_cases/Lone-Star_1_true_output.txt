SAM You know, if you figure minimum wage on the time most thieves spend in jail, they could have bought most everything they stole. 
AMADO I didn't steal anything. 
SAM I didn't say you did. My name is Sam, by the way. 
Amado just gives him a look-- 
INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE 
Sam and AMADO step out into the office, where Pilar stands waiting. 
SAM He's all yours. 
PILAR Are you okay? 
AMADO I don't know what the big deal is. 
PILAR You'll find out when I get you home. Thanks, Sam. 
SAM No problem. 
Pilar yanks AMADO outside by his arm. She turns to shoot a look back at Sam, then steps out through the glass door. 
CU SAM 
Watching her go-- 
SAM Any time. 
FADE OUT: 
EXT. OBSTACLE COURSE -- MORNING -- PIT 
We shoot up from a pit in the ground. WHUMP! WHUMP! WHUMP! Three men leap over, landing on the far side and running away from us. 
MEN 
Del Payne runs with Cliff and Mikey on a pathway along a security fence, the two sergeants struggling to keep up, occasionally vaulting or scaling some mild obstacle. 
MIKEY There's not that much down here, Colonel. Big O's is the only place in the county that our African American soldiers are uhm--that they feel comfortable in. 
DEL Have we had trouble there before? 
CLIFF Since I've been stationed here? A fistfight now and then-- 
MIKEY We had a kid pass out in the men's room. The town isn't much. 
DEL They didn't come for a vacation. 
CLIFF Yes sir. 
MIKEY You know how it is, Colonel--first time away from home, dealing with new people--I remember my first hitch-- 
DEL Substance abuse? 
MIKEY Well, yeah, but I went through the Program. I haven't had a drink since-- 
DEL I meant on the post. In general. How are you dealing with it? 
CLIFF We throw a urine test at them once a month. Random numbers, maybe a hundred people at a time 
DEL Why don't we make it once a week for a while? 
CLIFF No problem, sir. 
Del notices bow hard they are breathing-- 
DEL I sprint the last quarter mile. You gentlemen don't have to keep up if you don't care to. 
MIKEY Appreciate it, sir. 
Del accelerates and we HOLD with the sergeants, slowing to a near-walk. 
MIKEY Guy cracks walnuts with his asshole. 
CLIFF (Grins) You get the feeling he doesn't want to be here? 
INT. FORENSICS LAB -- VARIOUS SHOTS 
We hear Hank Williams' gospel song "I'll Have a New Body (I'll Have a New Life)" as we see the gathered bones of the skeleton tagged and photographed and measured, impressions made of the dental work in the skull, photographs of the excavation of the body at various stages marked with red grease pencil, the piece of metal laid in a de-tarnishing dish, the ring put under a microscope. 
CU METAL 
MUSIC CONTINUES as we TIGHTEN on the piece of metal, a pair of tongs pulling it from the de-tarnishing solution. It is a star-shaped badge, bearing the words "SHERIFF--RIO COUNTY." 
INT. COUNTRY AND WESTERN BAR -- AFTERNOON 
C&W MUSIC playing, the regulars starting to show up. Sam makes his way to a table where BEN WETZEL, a Texas Ranger, sits with a file of forensic reports. 
BEN Sam the Man.

BLONDE PACK LEADER No, he's just dumb. Probably the dumbest kid in class. Ms. Waterstraat had me alphabetize the IRB tests and you wouldn't believe what that retard did-- Sock! Trixie decks her to the shock of the rest of the pack just as the whine grows very loud and-- Speed comes rounding the bend on a little go-cart, wearing his too-big helmet making his big head seem ridiculously enormous. Zipping past, he suddenly notices the girl in the pink barrette standing over another girl; there is something about her-- Maybe it's way she's got her fists up, like a boy, or maybe it's the. way her jaw is set, ready to take on 
ANYONE-- Whatever it is, when their eyes suddenly meet, he finds he is unable to look away-- Staring at her, as he drives off the road, crashing through a hedge and tumbling down a hill. 
TRIXIE Speed! She runs to help him. He is laying sprawled out, his car on its side, wheels still spinning. 
TRIXIE (CONT'D) Are you alright? He's a bit groggy. 
SPEED .who are you? 
TRIXIE I'm Trixie. I'm in your class. 
CONTINUED: (2) 
SPEED .oh .yeah. He stares at her for a minute, powder-puffs of clouds floating about her head. 
SPEED (CONT'D) He, would you like to see my car 
COLLECTION She smiles. 
TRIXIE I'd love to. 
INT. POP'S GARAGE 
Pops and Rex are working on the T-180. Rex is in a wife- beater, up to his elbows in axel grease. The sound of an angry bee hive fills the room as Speed drives up through the big open door. 
SPEED Hey, Rex. Hey Pops. 
RE X Hey, Speedy. 
POPS Who's your friend? 
SPEED Her name's Trixie. She's in my class. 
TRIXIE Hi. 
POPS Pleasure to meet you, young lady. 
SPEED Hey pops, a guy wanted me to give this to you. He said he was a big fan. He hands him the package and Pops smiles. 
POPS A fan, is it? Not often we get someone with such good taste around here. Where is he? 
CONTINUED: 
SPEED He was in a hurry. Driving a '68 Fendersin. Sweet set. of wheels. The car description rings a bell for Rex. 
REX Let me see that. He grabs the box, then holds it to his ear. It's ticking. He jams it into the go-cart, against the pedal and slaps it in reverse. The go--.cart shoots out of the garage and down the driveway until-- It explodes, an enormous fireball ballooning up past the tree tops. Trixie's eyes flash with excitement. 
TRIXIE Cool beans! 
EXT. THUNDERHEAD RACEWAY - NIGHT - PRESENT 
Feeling the storm of emotions that she knows Speed must be feeling, she takes a deep breath and raises the binos back up. Through the magnifying lenses we see Speed flying around the track. 
INT. MEDIA ROW 
They are riding the story like Speed is driving the track. 
LOCAL ANNOUNCER --no one from these parts will forget the tragic story of Rex 
RACER-- 
HAROLD LEDERMAN ANNOUNCER --he nearly ruined racing-- 
AUSTRALIAN ANNOUNCER --single-handedly tried to save 
RACING-- 
CONTINUED: 
CHINESE ANNOUNCER --one of the greatest scandals in the history of the sport-- 
FRENCH ANNOUNCER --it is always the brightest star that burn out the fastest-- 
EXT. THUNDERHEAD RACEWAY - NIGHT 
Speed blister through the high-banked slalom and it seems at first that he is all alone but then we see the trace effect as we realize that the two cars are making perfectly identical moves until-- They bank into a straightaway, splitting apart, like a shadow suddenly cut free as both cars accelerate-- Neck and neck, the past a mirror of the present. 
YOUNG SPEED (V.0.) Can I go with you, Re 
INT. REX'S ROOM - NIGHT - PAST 
Young Speed watches as Rex packs his bags. 
REX Not this time, Speedy. 
SPEED When are you coming back? 
REX I don't know. I don't know. He snaps the bag shut. 
REX (CONT'D) Look, Speed... one day people might say things about me. No matter what they say, I hop... I just hope you never believe them.

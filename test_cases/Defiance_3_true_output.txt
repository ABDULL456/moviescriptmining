126 THE BLURRED IMAGE OF AN ANGEL FRAMED BY A HALO OF SUNLIGHT 126 as it swims into focus. Tuvia opens his eyes. It is Lilka. She sits beside him, mopping his forehead with a cool rag. 
LILKA Your fever broke in the night. The medicine helped. 
TUVIA How long was I asleep? 
LILKA Two days.

TUVIA And you've nursed me the whole time? 
LILKA Chaya helped. 
TUVIA Did you study nursing at university? 
LILKA We devoted ourselves to more essential knowledge -- like Greek Philosophy and Latin.

TUVIA I never went to university. 
LILKA What kind of work did you do? Before. 
TUVIA My wife's father had a store. Before the Race Laws. (looks at her) She is is dead. 
LILKA I'm sorry. 
TUVIA Tell me more about university. 
LILKA It all feels like a dream. I spent months trying to master Chopin's nocturnes. 
TUVIA I'd love to hear you play. 
LILKA You know Chopin? 
TUVIA Who doesn't? Chopin the butcher from Novogrudok. 
LILKA 
(LAUGHS) If you're well enough to tease me, you're well enough to eat. I'll see what's for supper. She gets up to go. 
TUVIA Thank you, Lilka. 
127 OUTSIDE TUVIA'S BUNKER 127 THE LUBCZANSKI'S have taken the fullest advantage of Tuvia's illness. There are now TWO LINES of people waiting for food. The malbushim line up like prison inmates. Lazar looks into his bowl -- two beans floating in a scummy broth. 
IN THE SHORTER LINE Motl, Arkady, Fischer, Levine and a few others are enjoying real food. Lazar calls out from the other line.

LAZAR Hey, Arkady This isn't soup, it's piss. 
ARKADY I will piss on your head and you will say it's raining. Eat it. The rest of Lubczanski's cabal laughs. TUVIA emerges from his bunker. The first thing he sees is Asael, whose face is BATTERED AND SWOLLEN. 
TUVIA What happened? Asael just looks over at the food line -- where Arkady has grabbed Chaya by the waist -- to the delight of the others. Tuvia strides over to them. 
TUVIA (CONT'D) What is this? 
ARKADY New policy. Fighters get better food. 
TUVIA Against my orders... 
ARKADY You are no longer Commander. Sorry. Tuvia nods, considering his remark for a moment. 
AND THEN TAKES OUT HIS PISTOL AND SHOOTS ARKADY IN THE CHEST! He then turns the gun on Motl and the others -- they literally cower in fear. He raises his voice to those watching. 
TUVIA As long as I am the leader of this group, you will obey my commands. 
THERE WILL BE NO MORE COMPLAINING! 
NO MORE SITTING! NO MORE DOING 
NOTHING. ANYONE WANTS TO LEAVE, THEY LEAVE. NOW! The rest work. Every morning we get up and we work. WE WORK. In the snow and the cold and the dark. Tomorrow we begin to build ten new zemylanka, we double the number of food missions. ...We work. (looks down at Arkady) Take his body into the woods and leave it for the wolves. He turns and walks away. As he passes the food lines, people subtly move out of his way and whisper after he is gone.

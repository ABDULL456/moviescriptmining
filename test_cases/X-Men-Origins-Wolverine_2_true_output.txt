CONTINUED: (2) Logan turns and stares at Stryker. 
LOGAN I'm gonna track him down and I'm gonna end him. That's the plan. 
I 
STRYKER You already tried that. He's a hundred miles away and you're walking out of the hospital. Logan's fists are clenched. He's ready to hammer Stryker into the ground, but the older man does not back down. STRYKER (cont'd) You can't beat him. Not the way you are right now. You've probably gone your whole life without losing a fight, but I'm telling you now, you can't beat him. 
(BEAT) Unless I give you the tools. Logan glares at Stryker, still itching for immediate revenge. STRYKER (cont'd) You come with me, I promise you two things. You will suffer more pain than any other man could bear. And you will have your revenge. Logan stares into Stryker's eyes. 
EXT. ALKALI LAKE - DAY 
A black helicopter lands on a concrete helipad inside the walls of the massive compound. SENTRIES armed with assault rifles man the guard towers, scanning the perimeter with binoculars. Logan, Stryker and Agent Zero step out of the helicopter. Logan glances around the foreboding place before following Stryker inside the main building. 
INT. SURGICAL PREP ROOM - DAY 
Logan lies on his back on an examining table, naked save for a strategically-placed towel. (-ONTTNTTFr) l 
CONTINUED: A red-bearded scientist, DR. CORNELIUS, draws blood from Logan with a syringe. An Army surgeon, CAROL HINES, marks Logan's skin with an indelible pen. He looks like a Maori warrior, his body mapped with strange lines, dots and x's. Stryker watches Hines work. 
STRYKER Could you unsheath your claws? Logan raises his left hand. The bone claws pop out, the same length they were before Creed shattered them. STRYKER (cont'd) Remarkable. Full regeneration. Logan examines the markings on his forearm. 
LOGAN The hell you planning on doing to me? Hines gives Stryker a worried look but he ignores her. 
STRYKER We're going to make you indestructible. But first we have to destroy you. Stryker heads for the door but stops midway and turns. STRYKER (cont'd) I forgot to give you something. He reaches into his jacket pocket, pulls out an old set of dog tags and tosses them to Logan. Logan inspects the tags with ambivalence. 
LOGAN Never wanted to put these on again. 
STRYKER Held on to them for years. Figured you'd be back one day. Logan slips the steel chain over his head. STRYKER (cont'd) 
(SMILING) Now you'll always know your name. 
INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 
Stryker walks down a long concrete corridor lit by fluorescent ceiling lights. Hines steps out of the prep room and hurries after him. 
HINES Sir? Stryker stops and waits.for her to catch up. HINES (cont'd) I know we've discussed this before-- He knows what she's going to say. He shakes his head and continues down the hallway, forcing Hines to chase after him. 
STRYKER Ad nauseam, Lieutenant. 
HINES Anesthetic won't work on him. His healing factor neutralizes drugs. Including painkillers. 
STRYKER He can handle the pain.

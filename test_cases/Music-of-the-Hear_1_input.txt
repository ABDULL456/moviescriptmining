ROBERTA I'm not talking about Charles. I'm talking about us. 
BRIAN Look, Roberta. Marriage is based on a belief that one person can completely meet another person's needs. I just don't buy that. 
This is making her nervous. She looks at him, afraid of what he might be saying. 
ROBERTA (carefully) What are you saying? If there's some need you have that I don't meet, you'd go and get it "met" by someone else? 
He heaves a sigh of frustration, not wanting to answer the question. 
BRIAN I'm saying that it's the 80's and it's a fantasy to think of marriage lasting these days. One out of two marriages ends in divorce! 
ROBERTA You didn't answer my question. (beat) If I don't meet all your needs, and we're in a committed relationship -- forget marriage for a minute; I'm just talking about a relationship -- would you go to someone else? 
A beat. 
BRIAN In theory, yes. 
ROBERTA In theory. 
Roberta looks very disheartened. Brian feels badly. 
BRIAN Roberta, we've got something good right now -- that's the important thing. Let's just keep it that way, O.K.? 
He pulls her to him, kissing her neck, but she pulls away from him. ON NICK, observing with an anxious expression. 
INT. ROBERTA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
NICK (O.S.) (whining) Why can't he? 
Roberta looks distressed by her talk with Brian as she and the boys enter, back from the park. 
ROBERTA He just can't, O.K.? Brian's at his house tonight, and we're at ours. 
NICK Well then I wanna go to his house. 
ROBERTA Enough, Nick. Now why don't you and your brother practice while I make dinner. 
NICK I don't feel like practicing. 
ROBERTA Well do it anyway. 
NICK I wanna go to Brian's! 
ROBERTA Stop whining, and get your violin. 
Nick stomps off to get his violin. Lexi follows. Roberta puts down her bag and takes off her coat. While Lexi sets up his violin, Nick opens his violin case, takes out the violin and angrily starts playing, loudly and roughly. 
ROBERTA What the hell are you doing? 
NICK The problem with you is you're mean to everybody and then they don't want to be with you! 
ROBERTA I've heard just about enough from you, young man. Now set your violin up properly and start practicing. 
Nick THROWS the violin against the floor. Roberta's speechless. 
NICK I hate the violin! 
ROBERTA You pick that violin up right now and don't you ever ever -- 
Nick picks up the violin and THROWS the violin down even harder, then YELLS at Roberta before she can even respond. 
NICK It's all your fault! You made Daddy leave and you're gonna make Brian leave too! You're gonna be all alone and I'll have to take care of you! 
Roberta is stunned. The anger drains out of her as she suddenly sees what this is all about. 
ROBERTA Nick -- you don't have to take care of me. 
NICK Then who's going to? 
ROBERTA I'll take care of myself -- and I'll take care of you and Lexi. I promise. 
NICK You didn't try hard enough. You made Daddy leave us. 
This hits her in the solar plexus. Her hurt and vulnerability start to pour out. 
ROBERTA That's not true. I begged him not to leave, but he didn't listen. 
NICK Why not? 
Roberta hesitates, but knows she has to tell them the truth. She addresses both boys. 
ROBERTA Your father met someone he liked more than Mommy, and then -- 
NICK Who? 
Roberta swallows, shocked to hear him ask this. She can hardly answer him. 
ROBERTA Lana. Remember our friends Lana and Tom? 
NICK Is he gonna marry her now?

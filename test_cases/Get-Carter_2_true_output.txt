CARTER It's urgent. 
MRS BRUMBY What's it about? 
CARTER Business. 
MRS BRUMBY I know all about Cliff's business. 
Carter moves further into the room. 
CARTER Yeah, well, tell him the Fletchers sent me. 
Mrs Brumby is uncertain what to do. Carter sits in an armchair to make his point. She leaves. A moment later Brumby storms into the room. 
BRUMBY What the bloody hell's all this? 
Carter doesn't move. 
BRUMBY You know what the bloody time is! (pause) It's two o'clock in the bloody morning! 
CARTER I know. 
BRUMBY Well? 
Carter still doesn 't move. 
BRUMBY The wife says the Fletchers sent you. 
Carter just looks at him. Weighing him up. 
BRUMBY What's so bloody important it couldn't wait till the morning? 
Carter starts to laugh. He realizes Thorpe has lied to him.  Brumby isn't his man. 
BRUMBY Listen, I'm not in the mood for bloody silly buggers. 
Carter stands. 
CARTER I made a mistake. 
BRUMBY What? 
CARTER I made a mistake. 
BRUMBY What about? 
CARTER Never mind. 
Brumby looks confused. 
BRUMBY It's not business? 
Carter moves to the door. 
CARTER See you. 
Brumby moves between him and the door. 
BRUMBY Listen, I don't like it when some hard nut comes pushing his way in and out my house in the middle of the night. 
Carter again makes to leave. Brumby stops him. 
BRUMBY Bloody well tell me who sent you. 
CARTER You're a big man, but you're in bad shape. With me, it's a full- time job. Now behave yourself.

A.J. Good. 
SHEPHERD Then let's clear this off the table and get everybody focused on the crime bill. I don't want to win this. I want to win it by a couple of touchdowns. 
A.J. We will, Mr. President. 
SHEPHERD Good. 
A.J. starts to leave. SHEPHERD stops him. 
SHEPHERD (continuing) A.J.? 
A.J. Yes? 
SHEPHERD Listen, Robin said something to me today that I'm sure she wouldn't have said it if...I mean, she wasn't saying it to me, I realize... (beat) Ah, never mind. Have a good night. 
A.J. Good night, Mr. President. 
SHEPHERD A.J., when we're out of the office and we're alone, you can call me Andy. 
A.J. I beg your pardon? 
SHEPHERD I mean you were the best man at my wedding, for crying out loud. Call me Andy. 
A.J. (laughing off the suggestion) Whatever you say, Mr. President.

A.J. (continuing) Have a good night, sir.

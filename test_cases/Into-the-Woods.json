{"train": "INTO THE WOODS \nScreenplay by \nJames Lapine \nMusic and Lyrics by \nStephen Sondheim \nFADE UP \nGrey clouds of an early morning sky. \nBAKER (V.O.) Once upon a time, in a far off kingdom, there lay a small village at the edge of the woods... \nSuddenly, the WELL-WORN BOOT of Cinderella steps into the frame and lands on what we thought was the sky, but in fact is simply its reflection in a puddle of water. A strong CHORD accents the splash and we begin a musical vamp. \nEXT. CINDERELLA'S HOUSE - DAYBREAK \nCLOSE-UP on CINDERELLA'S dirty hand as it reaches down to gather kindling. \nCINDERELLA (O.S.) \nI WISH... \nBAKER (V.O.) And in this village... \nCLOSE-UP on a bead of sweat as it trickles from her brow, the same hand entering the frame to wipe it. \nCINDERELLA (O.S.) \nMORE THAN ANYTHING... \nBAKER (V.O.) ... lived a young maiden... \nANGLE on CINDERELLA A pretty (and filthy) young woman, who finishes mopping her brow and trudges towards the back of a large house, the kindling under her arm. \nCINDERELLA \nMORE THAN LIFE... \nMORE THAN JEWELS... \nEXT. JACK'S FARMHOUSE - DAY \nCLOSE-UP on JACK'S calloused hands as he pulls on a rope. \nBAKER (V.O.) ... a care-free young lad... \nANGLE ON JACK A spaced-out twelve year-old who is trying to pull his bony cow MILKY-WHITE towards his dilapidated cottage. \nJACK \nI WISH... \nMORE THAN LIFE... \nINT. BAKER'S COTTAGE - DAY \nCLOSE-UP on a ball of dough. The BAKER'S thick hand pounds it. \nBAKER (V.O.) ... and a childless baker... \nANGLE ON THE BAKER AND HIS WIFE Hard-working and honest, he is kneading the dough which she then takes and puts in the oven. \nBAKER/BAKER'S WIFE \nI WISH... \nBAKER (V.O.) ... with his Wife-- \" \nBAKER \nMORE THAN ANYTHING... \nWIFE \nMORE THAN THE MOON... \nBAKER/BAKER'S WIFE \nI WISH... \nINT.

CINDERELLA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY \nCINDERELLA \nI WISH TO GO TO THE FESTIVAL-- \nINT. BAKER'S COTTAGE - DAY \nBAKER/WIFE \nMORE THAN RICHES... \nA room of mirrors. LUCINDA and FLORINDA, dressed in their ball gowns, study themselves side by side, reflected over and over. CINDERELLA enters through a mirrored door, breaking the image. \nFLORINDA \nHURRY UP AND DO MY HAIR, CINDERELLA! FLORINDA pulls at one of LUCINDA'S bows. \nFLORINDA (CONT'D) \nARE YOU REALLY WEARING THAT? \nLUCINDA grabs CINDERELLA. \nLUCINDA (pointing to her \nSLEEVE) \nHERE, I FOUND A LITTLE TEAR, \nCINDERELLA! LUCINDA eyes FLORINDA'S hair. \nLUCINDA (CONT'D) \nCAN'T YOU HIDE IT WITH A HAT? CINDERELLA grabs a stool and brings it next to FLORINDA. \nCINDERELLA \nYOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL. She stands on the stool and begins fixing FLORINDA'S hair. \nFLORINDA I know. \nLUCINDA She means me. \nFLORINDA No, she didn't! The two STEPSISTERS bicker as CINDERELLA brushes and twists their hair into tight curls: \nCINDERELLA (V.O.) \n(INTERNAL) \nMOTHER SAID BE GOOD,/ FATHER SAID BE \nNICE,/ THAT WAS ALWAYS THEIR ADVICE./ \nSO BE NICE, CINDERELLA,/ GOOD, \nCINDERELLA,/ NICE GOOD GOOD NICE-- \nFLORINDA Tighter! CINDERELLA obliges and becomes more aggressive with the hair styling, her emotions building as she thinks to herself: \nCINDERELLA (V.O.) \nWHAT'S THE GOOD OF BEING GOOD/ IF \nEVERYONE IS BLIND/ ALWAYS LEAVING YOU \nBEHIND?/ NEVER MIND, CINDERELLA,/ KIND \nCINDERELLA--/ NICE GOOD NICE KIND GOOD \nNICE-- FLORINDA screams, bringing CINDERELLA back to reality. \nFLORINDA Ow! Not that tight! Clod! She reels around and smacks CINDERELLA who stands stunned. The STEPSISTERS giggle and snort. \nINT. BAKER'S COTTAGE - DAY - LATER \nThe BAKER and his WIFE are cleaning up after their day's work. There is an unexpected knock at the door. They stare at one another momentarily. \nBAKER Who might that be? \nWIFE \n(CALLING OUT) We've sold our last loaf of bread! The BAKER opens the window a crack to see who is at the door. \nBAKER \n(ALARMED) It's the Witch from next door! The DOOR pops off its frame and goes flying across the room in a giant puff of smoke. The BAKER and his WIFE scream and cower in a corner. As the fog clears, we see the WITCH for the first time and she's not a pretty sight. MICE and other vermin drop from beneath her cape and scatter through the cottage. \nWIFE We have no bread. \nWITCH I don't want your bread. \nBAKER Then what is it you wish? \nWITCH It's not what I wish. It's what you wish. She moves towards the WIFE as the BAKER tries unsuccessfully to protect her. She points her gross finger towards her belly. \nWITCH (CONT'D) Nothing cooking in that belly now, is there? And there will never be... She looks away. \nWITCH (CONT'D) Unless you do exactly as I say. In three days' time, a Blue Moon will appear. Only then can the curse be undone. \nWIFE What curse? \nWITCH The one I placed on this house! \nBAKER What are you talking about? \nWITCH In the past, when you were no more than a babe, your father brought his young wife and you to this cottage. They were a lovely couple. But not lovely neighbors. You see, your mother was with child and she developed an unusual appetite. She admired my beautiful garden and she told your father that what she wanted, more than anything in the world was-- \nGREENS, GREENS, AND NOTHING BUT \nGREENS:/ PARSLEY, PEPPERS, CABBAGES \nAND CELERY./ ASPARAGUS AND WATERCRESS \nAND/ FIDDLEFERNS AND LETTUCE--!/ HE \nSAID, \"ALL RIGHT,\"/ BUT IT WASN'T, \nQUITE,/ `CAUSE I CAUGHT HIM/ IN THE \nAUTUMN/ IN MY GARDEN ONE NIGHT! \nEXT. WITCH'S GARDEN - NIGHT - FLASHBACK \nWITCH'S POV In the moonlight, we see the BAKER'S FATHER, wearing a hunting jacket, scale over the WITCH'S wall and into her garden. From behind a wooden trellis, she WATCHES him as he gathers her greens: \nWITCH (V.O.) \nHE WAS ROBBING ME,/ RAPING ME,/ \nROOTING THROUGH MY RUTABAGA,/ RAIDING \nMY ARUGULA \nWITCH And when your mother died, your father deserted you. Your father was no father -- so why should you be? \nBAKER (to his WIFE) I'm so sorry... \nWITCH \nNOW THERE'S NO MORE FUSS/ AND THERE'S \nNO MORE SCENES/ AND MY GARDEN THRIVES - \n/ YOU SHOULD SEE MY NECTARINES!/ BUT \nI'M TELLING YOU THE SAME/ I TELL KINGS \nAND QUEENS: The WITCH grabs some magical looking beans from a SMALL SATCHEL she carries across her body. She displays them. \nWITCH (CONT'D) \nDON'T EVER NEVER EVER/ MESS AROUND \nWITH MY GREENS!/ ESPECIALLY THE BEANS. \nEXT. JACK'S FARMHOUSE - DAY \nJACK with his cow stands outside with his MOTHER. \nJACK Why do I have to go to the next village? \nJACK'S MOTHER Because everyone in this village knows the cow hasn't given a drop of milk in weeks. \nJACK But that's cheating. \nJACK'S MOTHER We're starving, Jack. Don't you understand that? You're not to take less than five pounds for her. Are you listening to me? \nJACK \n(HE'S NOT) Yes. \nJACK'S MOTHER How much are you to ask? \nJACK No more than five pounds. She grabs his ear and squeezes it hard. \nJACK'S MOTHER JACK Less! Than five. ... than five! \nShe lets go and puts the COW'S leash in his hand and pushes him down the road towards the woods. \nJACK'S MOTHER \nINTO THE WOODS, THE TIME IS NOW./ WE \nHAVE TO LIVE, I DON'T CARE HOW./ INTO \nTHE WOODS TO SELL THE COW,/ YOU MUST \nBEGIN THE JOURNEY./ STRAIGHT THROUGH \nTHE WOODS AND DON'T DELAY,/ WE HAVE TO \nFACE/ THE MARKETPLACE./ INTO THE WOODS \nTO JOURNEY'S END-- \nJACK \n(STOPS; SADLY) \nINTO THE WOODS TO SELL A FRIEND-- \nINT. BAKER'S COTTAGE - DAY - CONTINUOUS \nThe WITCH, the BAKER, the BAKER'S WIFE. \nWITCH \nYOU WISH TO HAVE THE CURSE REVERSED? The BAKER and his WIFE nod. \nWITCH (CONT'D) \nI'LL NEED A CERTAIN POTION FIRST. The WITCH intently turns on them. \nWITCH (CONT'D) \nGO TO THE WOOD AND BRING ME BACK/ ONE: \nTHE COW AS WHITE AS MILK,/ TWO: THE \nCAPE AS RED AS BLOOD,/ THREE: THE HAIR \nAS YELLOW AS CORN,/ FOUR: THE SLIPPER \nAS PURE AS GOLD./ BRING ME THESE \nBEFORE THE CHIME/ OF MIDNIGHT IN THREE \nDAYS' TIME,/ `TIS THEN THE BLUE MOON \nREAPPEARS,/ WHICH COMES BUT ONCE EACH \nHUNDRED YEARS./ BRING THEM AND I \nGUARANTEE,/ A CHILD AS PERFECT AS \nCHILD CAN BE. \n(SHE EXPLODES) Go to the wood! The WITCH flings her arms and a hundred-mile wind throws the couple and all of their belongings across the room as she disappears in a cloud of smoke -- or is it flour? \nEXT. CINDERELLA'S HOUSE - ENTRY COURTYARD - DAY \nAn open-air carriage and horses wait in the courtyard. The STEPMOTHER, dressed to the nines, sweeps out of the house and impatiently calls over her shoulder. \nSTEPMOTHER Ladies. Our carriage awaits! CINDERELLA darts out of the house holding out the bowl of lentils to her STEPMOTHER. \nCINDERELLA \nNOW MAY I GO TO THE FESTIVAL? \nSTEPMOTHER The Festival! DARLING, THOSE NAILS!/ \nDARLING, THOSE CLOTHES!/ LENTILS ARE \nONE THING, BUT/ DARLING, WITH THOSE,/ \nINTO THE WOODS-- BUT EVEN SO,/ I HAVE \nTO TAKE THE JOURNEY. \nWIFE \nINTO THE WOODS/ THE PATH IS STRAIGHT,/ \nYOU KNOW IT WELL, \nBAKER \nBUT WHO CAN TELL--? \nWIFE (giving him a little \nPUSH) \nINTO THE WOODS TO LIFT THE SPELL-- \nEXT.

The BAKER walks deeper into the woods. \nEXT. DIRT ROAD BY JACK'S FARMHOUSE - DAY \nThe carriage carrying the STEPFAMILY crosses a small country bridge, then passes JACK'S MOTHER. One of the wheels turns in a puddle and splashes her with mud. \nALL \nINTO THE WOODS WITHOUT DELAY,/ BUT \nCAREFUL NOT TO LOSE THE WAY./ INTO THE \nWOODS, WHO KNOWS WHAT MAY/ BE LURKING \nON THE JOURNEY? \nEXT. WOODS - NATURAL ARCHWAY - DAY \nJACK enters the archway into the woods with his COW. \nALL \nINTO THE WOODS TO GET THE THING/ \nTHAT MAKES IT WORTH THE JOURNEYING. \nEXT. WOODS - DAY \nVARIOUS ANGLES on each of our CHARACTERS in different woodland surrounds. \nSTEPS \nINTO THE WOODS \nTO SEE THE KING-- \nJACK \nTO SELL THE COW-- \nBAKER \nTO MAKE THE POTION-- QUICK INTERCUTS between the characters: \nALL \nMOTHER SAID,/ \"COME WHAT MAY,/ FOLLOW \nTHE PATH/ AND NEVER STRAY.\" \nWOLF \nJUST SO, LITTLE GIRL--/ ANY PATH./ \nSO MANY WORTH EXPLORING./ JUST ONE \nWOULD BE SO BORING./ AND LOOK WHAT \nYOU'RE IGNORING... He ushers LRRH off the path to a lush meadow blanketed with exquisite purple flowers and wild berries. \nWOLF (CONT'D) (working himself up) \nTHINK OF THOSE CRISP,/ AGING BONES,/ \nTHEN SOMETHING FRESH ON THE PALATE./ \nTHINK OF THAT SCRUMPTIOUS CARNALITY/ \nTWICE IN ONE DAY.../ THERE'S NO \nPOSSIBLE WAY/ TO DESCRIBE WHAT YOU \nFEEL/ WHEN YOU'RE TALKING TO YOUR \nMEAL!

The WOLF climbs to the top of a precipice where he is silhouetted by the red hot sun. He lets out a mighty howl. \nEXT. WOODS - FLOWERED PATH - DAY - CONTINUOUS \nLRRH goes about her business picking flowers further from her path. ANGLE ON THE BAKER who has been observing LRRH from a distance. Like a bat, the WITCH swings upside down from a tree above the BAKER: \nWITCH Why are you standing there?! Go get the cape! \nBAKER You frightened me! The WITCH swings to the ground. \nWITCH Get it! Get it! Get it! \nBAKER How am I supposed to get it? \nWITCH You go up to the little thing, and you take it. \nBAKER I can't just take a cloak from a little girl. Why don't you take it! \nWITCH It's the rules. Why do you think I asked you in the first place? I'm not allowed to touch any of the objects! We suddenly hear the lilting sound of a young voice singing in the distance. The WITCH, almost intoxicated by her sound, swoons with delight. Then: \nWITCH (CONT'D) \n(YELLING) Get me what I need! Get me what I need! She wraps the cape about herself and disappears in such a strong blast of wind that it knocks the BAKER to the ground. \nBAKER This is ridiculous! ANOTHER ANGLE. LRRH is picking flowers off the path, blithely unaware of anything else. The BAKER gets up and hurries over to her. \nBAKER (CONT'D) Hello there little girl. \nLRRH Hello, Mr. Baker. \nBAKER Have you saved some of those sweets for Granny? \nLRRH I ate all the sweets and half the loaf of bread. \nBAKER So I see! Now tell me...where did you get that beautiful cape? \nLRRH My Granny made it for me. \nBAKER Is that right? I would love a red cape like that. \nLRRH \n(GIGGLING) You'd look pretty foolish. \nBAKER May I take a look at it? He quickly unties it. \nLRRH No! \nHe pulls it off her back, she grabs the other side. \nBAKER I need it badly. \nLRRH Please -- give it back! They have a tug of war. The BAKER pulls free and runs off with the cape. LRRH stands there momentarily stunned, then lets out a loud scream. ANGLE ON THE BAKER. He stops cold, realizing what he's done, then runs back to LRRH and places the cape around her shoulders. \nBAKER I'm sorry. I just wanted to make sure that you really loved this cape. Now off you go to Granny's -- and be careful that no wolf comes your way. \nLRRH I would rather a wolf than you any day. LRRH stamps on his foot. The BAKER hops on his good foot. \nBAKER \n(DISTRAUGHT) This is hopeless. I'll never get that red cape or find a golden cow and a yellow slipper -- or was it a golden slipper and a yellow cow? \nWIFE (O.S.) \nTHE COW AS WHITE AS MILK,/ THE CAPE AS \nRED AS BLOOD,/ THE HAIR AS YELLOW AS \nCORN,/ THE SLIPPER AS PURE AS-- He stops in his tracks. \nBAKER What are you doing here? The WIFE steps out from behind a thicket. \nWIFE You forgot your scarf. \nBAKER You shouldn't be here. It's not safe in these woods! \nWIFE I want to help. She goes to tie the WOOL SCARF around his neck but he pulls away. \nBAKER No! THE SPELL IS ON MY HOUSE-- \nWIFE \nEXT. WOODS - RAPUNZEL'S TOWER - DAY \nR-PRINCE POV An exquisite tower, surrounded by a thicket of tall rose bushes, with no entryway, just a lone window at its peak. At the bottom of the tower, the WITCH looks upward: \nWITCH Rapunzel. Rapunzel. Let down your hair to me. The PRINCE, hiding within the brush. \nR'S PRINCE (savoring the name) Rapunzel... At the window, the gorgeous young blonde girl, RAPUNZEL proceeds to lower the longest stretch of hair you've ever seen. The WITCH scales up the tower. (This causes more than a little discomfort for RAPUNZEL.) \nBAKER (V.O.) The old enchantress had given the name Rapunzel to the child she had hidden away and locked in a a doorless tower. But little did she know that the girl's lilting voice had caught the attention of a handsome Prince.\" \nR'S PRINCE Rapunzel... The PRINCE dashes back to his horse and gallops off. The WITCH arrives at the window. \nWITCH Don't you look lovely today, my dear. \nRAPUNZEL Thank you, Mother. \nWITCH I brought your favorite. Blackberries, fresh from the garden. \nEXT. GRANNY'S HOUSE - DAY \nLRRH walks over a rickety bridge that spans a brook. She stops and stares at the cottage which is built into a large \nOAK TREE. \nBAKER (V.O.) As the little girl approached her Granny's oak tree, she was surprised to see the door standing open. \nLRRH Oh dear, how uneasy I feel. Perhaps it's all the sweets. \nINT. GRANNY'S HOUSE - DAY \nLRRH makes her way down a curved staircase in the house. She sees the CURTAINS drawn around her GRANNY'S BED and, behind them, the SILHOUETTE of what \"looks like\" GRANNY. \nLRRH Granny? \nWOLF (In a granny voice) Come in, my deary. LRRH moves towards the bed with trepidation and slowly pulls back the curtain. The WOLF is revealed, lying under the covers, dressed in GRANNY'S nightcap and robe. \nLRRH My, Grandmother. You're looking very strange. What big ears you have! \nWOLF The better to hear you with, my dear. The handsome WOLF flashes a smile that reveals a set of gleaming white FANGS. \nEXT. GRANNY'S HOUSE - DAY \nThe BAKER crosses the bridge and heads towards the cottage. He suddenly hears LRRH scream. Nervously he pulls the knife from his belt. \nBAKER (V.O.) And with a single bound, the wolf had devoured the little girl. Well, it was a full day of eating for both. \nINT. GRANNY'S HOUSE - DAY - CONTINUOUS \nThe BAKER enters and hears a loud SNORE. Brandishing the knife, he moves towards the bed where he sees the WOLF DRESSED AS GRANNY, sound asleep, a piece of the red cloth sticking out of it's mouth. Squeamishly, he pulls back the sheet to see the WOLF'S SWOLLEN STOMACH. He raises his knife and as he brings it slashing down we hear a loud HOWL from the WOLF. \nCUT TO BLACK \nEXT. GRANNY'S HOUSE - DAY - LATER \nFADE UP ON THE BAKER, clearly shaken, leaving the cottage and walking away. \nBAKER I can't believe I just did that. LRRH and GRANNY appear at the doorway behind him. \nLRRH \n(CALLING) Wait! \nGRANNY Aren't you going to help us skin that beast? \nBAKER No thanks! \nGRANNY What kind of hunter are you? \nBAKER I'm a baker. \nGRANNY gives him a disdainful look and goes back into the house. LRRH in her cape runs after the BAKER as he approaches the rickety bridge. \nLRRH Wait a minute. I never thanked you. \nBAKER You need to be more careful, young lady. \nLRRH I'm sorry. I should have known better. \nMOTHER SAID,/ \"STRAIGHT AHEAD,\"/ NOT \nTO DELAY/ OR BE MISLED./ I SHOULD HAVE \nHEEDED/ HER ADVICE.../ BUT HE SEEMED \nSO NICE. \nAND HE SHOWED ME THINGS,/ MANY \nBEAUTIFUL THINGS,/ THAT I HADN'T \nTHOUGHT TO EXPLORE./ THEY WERE OFF MY \nPATH,/ SO I NEVER HAD DARED./ I HAD \nBEEN SO CAREFUL/ I NEVER HAD CARED./ \nAND HE MADE ME FEEL EXCITED--/ WELL, \nEXCITED AND SCARED. LRRH relives her nightmare. \nINT. GRANNY'S HOUSE - DAY - NIGHTMARE \nLRRH walks down the staircase towards GRANNY'S bed. She sees the WOLF'S silhouette through the bed curtains. \nLRRH (V.O.) (CONT'D) \nWHEN HE SAID \"COME IN!\"/ WITH THAT \nSICKENING GRIN,/ HOW COULD I KNOW WHAT \nWAS IN STORE?/ ONCE HIS TEETH WERE \nBARED,/ THOUGH, I REALLY GOT SCARED--/ \nWELL, EXCITED AND SCARED./ LRRH grabs hold of the bed curtains and pulls them around herself. \nINT. THE WOLF'S BELLY - NIGHTMARE \nLRRH falls down a dark cavernous void. \nLRRH (V.O.) (CONT'D) \n(STARTLED) Yes. I just need to catch my breath. \nWIFE What a beautiful gown you're wearing. Were you at the King's Festival? CINDERELLA, preoccupied, collects herself so she can continue on her way. \nCINDERELLA Yes. \nWIFE Aren't you the lucky one. Why ever are you in the woods at this hour? We hear the PRINCE'S ENTOURAGE approaching. \nSTEWARD (O.S.) This way! \nCINDERELLA Please. Don't let them know I'm here. She quickly hides herself in the brush. The WIFE turns around and looks to the top of the rise to see C-PRINCE on a black stallion, with his STEWARD and ATTENDANTS in tow. He calls down to the WIFE. \nC'S PRINCE Have you seen a beautiful young woman in a ball gown pass through? \nWIFE (Breathless as she \nBOWS) I don't think so, sir. \nSTEWARD \n(POINTING) If I may, my lord, I think I see her over there. The ENTOURAGE races off and CINDERELLA reappears and sits, catching her breath. \nWIFE I've never lied to royalty before. I've never anything to royalty before! \nCINDERELLA Thank you. \nWIFE If a prince were looking for me, I certainly wouldn't hide. \nCINDERELLA Well, what brings you here -- and with a cow? \nWIFE Oh, my husband's somewhere in the woods. \n(WITH PRIDE) He's undoing a spell. \nCINDERELLA \n(IMPRESSED) Oh? \nWIFE Oh, yes.

WOODS - TALL TREES - DAY - CONTINUOUS \nThe BAKER follows after JACK and collides into his WIFE, dropping his satchel and revealing the red cape. He hides the money sack. \nBAKER What are you doing here? \nWIFE Well... She doesn't want to tell him she's lost MILKY-WHITE. \nWIFE (CONT'D) I see you've got the red cape! \nBAKER Yes. I've got the cape. Only two items left. \nWIFE \n(SHEEPISH) Three. \nBAKER Two.

PULL BACK to reveal the PRINCES side by side on a precipice, overlooking the distant castle. \nEXT. RAPUNZEL'S TOWER - NIGHT \nThe BAKER'S WIFE fights her way through a thicket. Her clothes are now ratty, her face scratched - but she approaches the tower with trepidation. \nWIFE Rapunzel, Rapunzel? Let your hair down to me. The window at the top of the tower opens and RAPUNZEL sticks out her head looking downward. The WIFE hides to the side. \nRAPUNZEL \n(DUBIOUS) Is that you at this hour, my Prince? \nWIFE (in her best princely \nBASS VOICE) Yes. RAPUNZEL thinks about it for a moment, then lowers her hair. The WIFE approaches it gingerly. \nWIFE (CONT'D) Excuse me for this. She takes a fist full of hair and gives it a pull. Nothing. She tries once again, this time with more force eliciting a little yelp from RAPUNZEL. Finally, she holds on to the hair and just starts running away from the tower as fast as she can. We hear RAPUNZEL yell as the WIFE succeeds in pulling some of the hair from her head. \nEXT. PATHWAY TO THE CASTLE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS \nCinderella flees the castle. \nBAKER (V.O.) As the Baker's Wife bolted from the tower, the second night of the festival was thrown into chaos when Cinderella once again ran from the Prince. While the BAKER'S WIFE continues to run away from Rapunzel's tower, in the distance she sees a flutter of gold moving through the moonlit trees. CINDERELLA? She changes course in pursuit. SERIES OF SHOTS with MUSIC CLOSE-UP on CINDERELLA'S SHOES as they make their way through wooded path. ANGLE ON THE WIFE as she races towards them in pursuit. The WIFE catches up with CINDERELLA and tackles her to the ground, CINDERELLA'S slipper falling off. They both dive for the slipper, when an approaching noise catches the WIFE'S attention. \nC'S PRINCE (O.S.) Over here! CLOSE-UP on the shoe as CINDERELLA snatches it from the ground. CINDERELLA rushes off. The WIFE stares frozen in horror as the PRINCE'S HORSE races towards her. She lets out a scream and the horse stops short, rearing up. The STEWARD'S horse charges off the path into thickets. \nC'S PRINCE (CONT'D) Who is she? Where did she go? \nWIFE \n(BOWING) I have no idea, sir. \nYOU'VE BEGUN,/ IT TAKES TWO OF YOU./ \nIT'S NO FUN,/ BUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE \nDONE/ YOU CAN DO/ WHEN THERE'S TWO OF \nYOU. \nIF I DARE,/ IT'S BECAUSE I'M BECOMING/ \nAWARE/ OF US/ AS A PAIR/ OF US,/ EACH \nACCEPTING A SHARE/ OF WHAT'S THERE. They move towards each other through the trees playfully. \nBOTH \nWE'VE CHANGED./ WE'RE STRANGERS./ I'M \nMEETING YOU IN THE WOODS./ WHO MINDS/ \nWHAT DANGERS?/ I KNOW WE'LL GET PAST \nTHE WOODS. \nAND ONCE WE'RE PAST,/ LET'S HOPE THE \nCHANGES LAST/ BEYOND WOODS,/ BEYOND \nWITCHES AND SLIPPERS AND HOODS,/ JUST \nTHE TWO OF US--/ BEYOND LIES,/ SAFE AT \nHOME WITH OUR BEAUTIFUL PRIZE,/ JUST \nTHE FEW OF US. \nIT TAKES TRUST./ IT TAKES JUST/ A BIT \nMORE AND WE'RE DONE./ They sit down next to each other at the top of a small hill and slide down to the bottom together. \nBOTH (CONT'D) \nWE WANT FOUR,/WE HAD NONE./ WE'VE GOT \nTHREE./ WE NEED ONE./ IT TAKES TWO. They kiss but their moment of romance is interrupted when a large GOLDEN EGG rolls down the hill between them. The WIFE screams. \nJACK (O.S.) Stop it! Stop my egg! The BAKER stops the egg and picks it up. JACK stumbles down the hill. \nJACK (CONT'D) Oh, brilliant! My Milky-White. And the owners. And my egg! \nBAKER Where did you get this? \nJACK From the Giant's hen! The BAKER'S WIFE examines the egg. \nWIFE A golden egg! I've never seen a golden egg. \nJACK And you can have it. Along with the five gold pieces. \nWIFE Five gold pieces? \nJACK Now I'm taking my cow. JACK moves to MILKY-WHITE. The distant CHIMES OF MIDNIGHT begin to ring out from the castle. \nBAKER JACK \n(OVERLAPPING) (OVERLAPPING) Now, I never said I would But you took the five gold sell. pieces. \nWIFE BAKER You took five gold pieces?! I didn't take, you gave. \nWIFE Where are the five gold pieces? \nJACK You said I could have my cow! \nBAKER WIFE Now I never said you could. I You would take money before a said you might. child?! \nBAKER No, no, no - it's not how it sounds! \nJACK \n(ALARMED) Milky-White...! MILKY-WHITE has begun to shake like a dashboard ornament. She moans, then topples over with a loud thud. Alarmed, JACK runs to the cow and lays his head on the animal's chest. \nJACK (CONT'D) \n(TEARFUL) Milky-White is dead! The BAKER looks up and sees that the SHADOW has now moved a third of the way across the MOON. We hear the WITCH scream: \nWITCH(O.S.) \nTWO MIDNIGHTS GONE! \nEXT. RAPUNZEL'S TOWER - DAYBREAK \nHidden by a broken piece of WALL -- someone or something is watching the R-PRINCE climbing out of the window. \nBAKER (V.O.) When dawn broke, the Baker and his Wife had but one day left to reverse the Witch's curse. As for Rapunzel's Prince, he returned yet again to the forbidden tower. \nWith RAPUNZEL smiling down, the R-PRINCE descends her hair. Once he has reached the bottom, she pulls her hair back in and closes the window. ANOTHER ANGLE. We discover that it's the WITCH who has been watching. She is not happy. The PRINCE mounts his horse and rides off towards a low rose thicket -- an easy jump. With a thrust of her stick, the WITCH makes the thicket shoot up before the PRINCE has time to act. His HORSE stops short and he screams as he is thrown over the horse's head into the thicket. ANGLE ON THE WITCH. She smiles at her handiwork then turns to stare at the top of the tower vindictively. \nINT. RAPUNZEL'S TOWER - DAY \nThe WITCH threatens RAPUNZEL. \nWITCH \nWHAT DID I CLEARLY SAY?/ CHILDREN MUST \nLISTEN. \nRAPUNZEL No, no, please! \nWITCH \nWHAT WERE YOU NOT TO DO?/ CHILDREN \nMUST SEE-- \nRAPUNZEL No! \nWITCH \nAND LEARN./ WHY COULD YOU NOT OBEY?/ \nCHILDREN SHOULD LISTEN./ WHAT HAVE I \nWIFE I'm going to get the slipper. \nBAKER The yellow slipper? \nWIFE The GOLDEN slipper! \nBAKER Yes. The golden slipper, that's what I meant. How are you going to get it? \nWIFE I have met a maiden with golden slippers these two previous nights. \nBAKER You think you could get one? \nWIFE Yes, I'm sure of it. I'll meet you back here. \nBAKER Right. \n(BEAT) Why are we always separating? \nWIFE Because we have to if we're going to be together... The BAKER and his WIFE start to go off in opposite directions when there is a TREMENDOUS CRASH with the force of an earthquake. The BAKER and his WIFE are knocked off their feet and tumble into a bank of FERNS. They scramble to their feet and look to one another. \nWIFE (CONT'D) What is happening? \nEXT. JACK'S FARMHOUSE - AFTERNOON \nThe Giant lies still on the ground. \nBAKER (V.O.) The entire kingdom shook when the beanstalk came crashing down, killing the Giant... \nEXT. KING'S CASTLE - PALACE STEPS - NIGHT \nThe MOON is now half covered by SHADOW. DROP DOWN to find CINDERELLA running down the steps; commotion ensues as she is followed by the PRINCE and his retinue. \nBAKER (V.O.) ...as for Cinderella, she fled from the Prince... again. ANOTHER ANGLE. Suddenly, when CINDERELLA is MID-FLIGHT on the steps, she falters, unable to move. She looks down to see that there is TAR on this step and her shoes are stuck. ANGLE ON THE PRINCE. Smiling as he sees he has finally trapped his prey. We FREEZE the action as CINDERELLA considers the situation. \nCINDERELLA \nHE'S A VERY SMART PRINCE,/ HE'S A \nPRINCE WHO PREPARES./ KNOWING THIS \nTIME I'D RUN FROM HIM,/ HE SPREAD \nPITCH ON THE STAIRS./ AND I'M CAUGHT \nUNAWARES./ WELL, IT MEANS THAT HE \nCARES--/ THIS IS MORE THAN JUST \nMALICE./ BETTER STOP AND TAKE STOCK/ \nWHILE YOU'RE STANDING HERE STUCK/ ON \nTHE STEPS OF THE PALACE. \nALL RIGHT, WHAT DO YOU WANT?/ HAVE TO \nMAKE A DECISION./ WHY NOT STAY AND BE \nCAUGHT?/ SHOULD I GIVE THAT A \nTHOUGHT,/ WHAT WOULD BE HIS RESPONSE?/ She turns around to see the PRINCE, frozen in time and staring at her. \nCINDERELLA (CONT'D) \nBUT THEN WHAT IF HE KNEW/ WHO I AM \nWHEN I KNOW/ THAT I'M NOT WHAT HE \nTHINKS/ THAT HE WANTS? \nOR THEN WHAT IF I AM/ WHAT A PRINCE \nWOULD ENVISION?/ BUT THEN HOW CAN YOU \nKNOW/ WHO YOU ARE TILL YOU KNOW/ WHAT \nYOU WANT, WHICH I DON'T?/ SO THEN \nWHICH DO YOU PICK:/ WHERE YOU'RE SAFE, \nOUT OF SIGHT,/ AND YOURSELF, BUT WHERE \nEVERYTHING'S WRONG?/ OR WHERE \nEVERYTHING'S RIGHT/ BUT YOU KNOW THAT \nYOU'LL NEVER BELONG? \nAND WHICHEVER YOU PICK,/ DO IT QUICK,/ \n`CAUSE YOU'RE STARTING TO STICK/ TO \nTHE STEPS OF THE PALACE. \nIT'S MY FIRST BIG DECISION,/ THE \nCHOICE ISN'T EASY TO MAKE./ TO ARRIVE \nAT A BALL/ IS EXCITING AND ALL--/ ONCE \nYOU'RE THERE, THOUGH, IT'S SCARY. AND \nIT'S FUN TO DECEIVE/ WHEN YOU KNOW YOU \nCAN LEAVE,/ BUT YOU HAVE TO BE WARY. \nTHERE'S A LOT THAT'S AT STAKE,/ BUT \nI'VE STALLED LONG ENOUGH,/ `CAUSE I'M \nSTILL STANDING STUCK/ IN THE STUFF ON \nTHESE STEPS... \nBETTER RUN ALONG HOME/ AND AVOID THE \nCOLLISION./ THOUGH AT HOME THEY DON'T \nCARE,/ I'LL BE BETTER OFF THERE/ WHERE \nTHERE'S NOTHING TO CHOOSE,/ SO THERE'S \nINT. CINDERELLA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS \nCINDERELLA has only just got back. Grubby again, and wearing her old clothes, she bundles her beautiful dress into a chest. \nSTEWARD (O.S.) All young maidens are hereby commanded to remain in their home until they are visited by the Royal Guard. CINDERELLA goes to the window and looks out. \nEXT. CINDERELLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS \nCINDERELLA'S POV: The C-PRINCE and the royal RETINUE arrive in the entry courtyard. BACK ON CINDERELLA. She smiles to herself. \nINT. CINDERELLA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT \nThe entire STEPFAMILY has assembled, in various stages of undress. LUCINDA stands and watches as the STEPMOTHER tries to force FLORINDA'S large foot into the tiny slipper. \nBAKER (V.O.) As the Prince anxiously waited, the Stepmother took matters -- and Florinda's foot -- into her own hands. \nFLORINDA \nCAREFUL, MY TOE--! \nSTEPMOTHER \nDARLING, I KNOW-- \nFLORINDA \nWHAT'LL WE DO? \nSTEPMOTHER \nIT'LL HAVE TO GO./ BUT WHEN YOU'RE HIS \nBRIDE,/ YOU CAN SIT OR RIDE./ YOU'LL \nNEVER NEED TO WALK! The STEPMOTHER takes a handkerchief and stuffs it into the girl's mouth and then pulls a large kitchen knife from her pocket and raises it over her foot-- \nEXT. CINDERELLA'S HOUSE - ENTRY COURTYARD - NIGHT \nStanding lanterns have been set up outside the house, bathing the area in light. The STEPFAMILY watches as the STEWARD helps FLORINDA up on to the back of the Prince's horse. In pain, she grits her teeth in a frozen smile. \nBAKER (V.O.) Minus one toe, Florinda mounted the Prince's horse, unaware of the blood dripping from the slipper. As the STEWARD steps back, he notices a tiny speck of blood on his white glove. He looks up to the PRINCE to show him his hand. The PRINCE looks back to FLORINDA who shrugs sheepishly. \nINT. CINDERELLA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT \nThis time the STEPMOTHER tries to force LUCINDA'S foot into the slipper. FLORINDA looks on with a smirk. \nBAKER (V.O.) Lucinda was next. \nLUCINDA \nWHY WON'T IT FIT? \nSTEPMOTHER \nDARLING, BE STILL./ CUT OFF A BIT/ \nOF THE HEEL AND IT WILL./ (she pulls out knife) \nAND WHEN YOU'RE HIS WIFE/ YOU'LL HAVE \nSUCH A LIFE,/ YOU'LL NEVER NEED TO \nWALK! \nQUICK SHOTS: FLORINDA'S hand over LUCINDA'S mouth. The KNIFE raised up by the mother. LUCINDA'S eyes in fear as we hear a muffled scream and the \"WOOSH\" of a knife-- \nEXT. CINDERELLA'S HOUSE - ENTRY COURTYARD - NIGHT \nThe PRINCE and STEWARD wait impatiently in the torchlight. \nBAKER (V.O.) Minus a heel, Lucinda did her best to swallow the pain. At last, LUCINDA appears, masking her pain with a smile, and limps towards the PRINCE. She is followed by her MOTHER and \nSISTER. \nSTEPMOTHER It's a perfect fit, Your Highness! LUCINDA winks at the PRINCE flirtatiously, then promptly faints to the ground with a thud. The shoe falls from her foot. The PRINCE nods to the STEWARD who walks over and gingerly picks up the bloody slipper. \nC'S PRINCE Have you no other daughters? \nSTEPMOTHER Only a little stunted kitchen wench, which her late father left behind but she cannot present herself. She is too dirty. Out of the shadows, CINDERELLA appears. The STEWARD hands the slipper to the Prince, who kneels down in front of CINDERELLA and easily slips it on her foot. \nC'S PRINCE I would recognize these beautiful eyes anywhere. This is the true bride! The PRINCE sweeps CINDERELLA off her feet and leads her to his horse. The two of them ride off. FLORINDA and LUCINDA watch, not at all happy. Then they hear a CAWING (the sound of birds) overhead. They look up, alarmed. BIRD'S POV. Far below, FLORINDA and LUCINDA cower together, dreading what is to come as the CAMERA rushes towards them. \nBAKER (V.O.) As punishment for their cruelty, Cinderella's birds swooped down upon the Stepsisters... and blinded them. The BIRDS enter the picture frame, more and more, their CAWING rising to a crescendo until their flapping wings are all we see. \nEXT. MARSHLAND - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS \nRAPUNZEL is alone in a mossy bower on an isolated island in the middle of swamp waters filled with POISONOUS SNAKES. She hums a sad refrain. \nBAKER (V.O.) As for Rapunzel, the Witch had banished her to a swamp in the darkest depths of the forest. ANOTHER ANGLE. The R-PRINCE with a ragged scarf wrapped around his now blinded eyes, sits slumped over on his horse as the animal navigates its way through the marshy expanse. The R-PRINCE lifts his head as he hears RAPUNZEL'S singing. \nCould it be? The horse, seemingly knowing the way, follows the sound as the R-PRINCE calls her name. \nR'S PRINCE Rapunzel? Rapunzel? \nANGLE ON RAPUNZEL She looks up and cries with delight when she sees her PRINCE across the water. \nRAPUNZEL My darling! She jumps into the swamp, fearlessly ignoring the SNAKES, until she reaches terra firma and her man. R-PRINCE falls from his horse onto the ground. \nR'S PRINCE Rapunzel? Is it you? RAPUNZEL reaches him and rips off his scarf. She kneels to cradle his face, weeping. \nRAPUNZEL How could she do this to you? EXTREME CLOSE-UP: RAPUNZEL'S TEAR falls into the R-PRINCE'S blind eye. The PRINCE'S vision is restored. \nR'S PRINCE \n(ASTONISHED) Rapunzel! \nRAPUNZEL What? \nR'S PRINCE I can see you! The two of them embrace. At the same time, we hear MOOING. \nEXT. WOODS - TALL TREES - NIGHT \nThe BAKER is pulling a very obstinate WHITE COW through the woods. He looks up at the MOON which is almost completely covered in SHADOW. \nBAKER (to the COW) Come on! We don't have any time... Then the WIFE rushes in from another direction, carrying the \nSLIPPER. \nWIFE I've found you! (sees the cow) You've got the cow! \nBAKER You've got the slipper! \nJACK You can use the silky hair of the corn-- \nWITCH Yes! Pull it from the ear and feed it to the cow. Quickly! The BAKER grabs the ear of corn from JACK, pulls the hair from the corn and feeds it to the cow. JACK begins milking the cow again. We hear the distant CHIMES OF MIDNIGHT begin. Light pours from above bathing them in a growing haze of BLUE LIGHT as the SHADOW finally eclipses the MOON. The COW lets out a BLOODCURDLING MOAN. \nWIFE It's working! \nJACK She's milking! The WITCH grabs the chalice. \nWITCH At last! The WITCH drinks the potion. She begins to shake. Blue smoke begins to pour from her and swirl about as if she is trapped inside a cloud. The WIFE lets out a shriek.. The BAKER looks at his WIFE, her belly begins to grow to nine- months-full of pregnancy. \nBAKER That was quick! The cloud that has surrounded the WITCH now engulfs the area until a brisk wind blows it away, revealing a beautiful woman standing in the BLUE LIGHT of the FULL MOON. The WITCH has been restored to her former self, and she likes what she sees. The final CHIME OF MIDNIGHT is joined by every other BELL IN THE KINGDOM -- a joyous cacophony as we: \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ROAD TO KING'S CASTLE/KING'S CASTLE - A NEW DAY \nGOLDEN ROSE PETALS fill the air, swirling across the screen. PULLING BACK we see that the petals are being thrown by CHEERING SUBJECTS who toss more into the air as they clamor to catch a glimpse of CINDERELLA and her PRINCE on their wedding day. MUSIC. CINDERELLA'S carriage resplendent in gold drawn by black stallions passes. She sits demurely smiling as her PRINCE plays to the PASSERS-BY. This comes easily to him. \nBAKER (V.O.) And it came to pass, all that seemed wrong was now right. The Witch succeeded in reversing her mother's curse. Cinderella finally stopped running from her Prince. CINDERELLA'S POV on the crowd. She sees JACK and his MOTHER waving; JACK'S MOTHER is over- dressed in brand new clothes including a ridiculous \"fascinator\" hat. \nBAKER (V.O.) Jack was reunited with his beloved cow and his mother could now dress in the best a golden egg could buy. Cinderella now sees the BAKER and his WIFE standing amongst the crowd, the WIFE holding their new BABY BOY. \nBAKER (V.O.) And the Baker and his Wife were proud parents of a strapping baby boy. The WIFE shows her the BABY. \nWIFE (calling to her) Thanks for the slipper. The carriage arrives at the entrance to the castle. As the PRINCE and CINDERELLA step from their carriage they are met by cheers. The STEPFAMILY awaits the married couple. The beaming STEPMOTHER with her DAUGHTERS who are now wearing dark glasses, holding canes and looking rather glum. RAPUNZEL stands with her PRINCE. The CROWD ROARS as CINDERELLA and her PRINCE wave. The STEWARD takes up a large speaking trumpet and the CROWD quiets. \nSTEWARD Let us cheer the newlyweds as they embark on their happy bliss today, and \nEVER AFTER-- \nBAKER (V.O.) And so with the kingdom filled with joy, those who deserved to were destined to live happily ever... \nSuddenly the earth SHAKES with a mighty force, tossing CINDERELLA and her PRINCE (mid-kiss), along with their ATTENDANTS and the entire CROWD to the ground. A piece of the CASTLE comes CRASHING DOWN. Chaos ensues. JACK'S MOTHER stands up and looks around. No sign of JACK. \nJACK'S MOTHER Jack? Jack...? ANGLE ON BAKER and his WIFE. \nBAKER \n(STUNNED) Are you alright? \nWIFE I think so. \nBAKER And the baby? \nWIFE Yes, he's fine. There is another AFTERSHOCK. ANGLE ON RAPUNZEL. She is spooked by the commotion and runs off through the crowd and disappears. \nSTEWARD (speaking into the \nHORN) Attention! Attention! Let there be no panic. NO PANIC! The Royal Prince wishes to address his loyal subjects. Attention! The R-PRINCE searches the crowd for RAPUNZEL. Those who haven't fled, quiet and gather around. The C-PRINCE takes the horn. \nC'S PRINCE There's no need for worry. It was an earthquake in a far-off quadrant of our kingdom. Nothing to fear at all. As many of you know, we had another little shaker just days ago. I will personally investigate the disturbance. Now everyone, back to your villages, and on with your lives! \nEXT. KINGDOM - DAY \nA dense mist settles across the kingdom. In the distance a beanstalk stretches up to the sky. C'S PRINCE and his RETINUE gallop away from the destroyed castle into the woods. \nBAKER (V.O.) But as they made their way back into the woods, their familiar paths were nowhere to be found and their lives were about to take an unexpected turn. \nEXT. WOODS - FLOWERED PATH - DAY \nThe BAKER and his WIFE are walking down a path -- or the remnants of a path. \nWIFE What's happened? Everything's so different. They discover LRRH sitting on her suitcase in what was once a lush area, now trampled and broken. \nBAKER Hello, little one. Are you alright? What are you doing here? With a suitcase? \nLRRH I'm moving in with Granny. Our whole village collapsed. I couldn't find my mother anywhere. And now I can't find my Granny's cottage. \nBAKER What do you mean? \nLRRH I went down the dell, and I didn't recognize anything. There was no path. (getting worked up) Where's the stream? Where's the bridge? Where's Granny? \nWIFE Calm down. \nBAKER We can help you find Granny's without the path. \nWIFE Yes. The WIFE is exhausted. She hands the BABY to the BAKER. \nWIFE (CONT'D) Please take him for a few moments. The BAKER is clearly uncomfortable holding the BABY. They continue walking. The BABY begins to cry. \nBAKER Why does he always cry when I hold him? \nWIFE You needn't hold him as if he was so fragile. The BABY wails. The BAKER hands the bundle back. \nBAKER He doesn't want me. He wants his mother! \nWIFE I can't take care of him all of the time. \nBAKER I'll take care of him -- when he's older... They hear COMMOTION in the distance. \nWIFE Who might that be? \nBAKER It's the Steward and the royal family. \nEXT. WOODS - TALL TREES - DAY - CONTINUOUS \nThrough a thick haze, the BAKER sees the STEWARD, the STEPFAMILY and a few SERVANTS carrying trunks and tending to the blind, hobbling STEPSISTERS. The BAKER makes his way to them with his WIFE and LRRH in tow. \nBAKER What brings you into the woods? \nSTEWARD The castle has been destroyed. \nWIFE No! \nSTEPMOTHER The kingdom is under attack. \nBAKER What is the Royal family going to do? \nSTEWARD I have no idea! I don't make policy. I just carry it out. \nWIFE (to the Baker) I think it best we get back to the village. We'll take the girl with us. She holds out a hand for LRRH. \nWIFE (CONT'D) You come with us. LRRH takes her hand. But then the ground begins to shake. A frightening and increasingly loud crunching noise. They fight for their footing. The STEPFAMILY drop their belongings and rush to each other. The BAKER puts his arm around his WIFE. Everyone's faces fill with terror as a huge shadow engulfs them. \nWIFE (CONT'D) It's a giant! \nBAKER A giant woman! Through the trees we see the furious face of a female GIANT. We never see her in her entirety -- but the volume of her voice matches her size. \nGIANT Where is the lad who killed my husband? \nSTEWARD There is no lad here! \nWITCH I was just trying to be a good mother! \nR'S PRINCE \n(URGING HER) Rapunzel... RAPUNZEL takes one look at her MOTHER then moves to the \nPRINCE. \nWITCH Rapunzel, no! You will never be safe with him. \nRAPUNZEL Take me away from here. R-PRINCE pulls RAPUNZEL up onto his horse. \nWITCH No! Rapunzel! \nRAPUNZEL Don't you understand? I never want to see you again. Ever! ANGLE ON THE WITCH watching RAPUNZEL ride into the woods. \nWITCH \n(TO HERSELF) \nNO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY,/ CHILDREN \nWON'T LISTEN./ NO MATTER WHAT YOU \nKNOW,/ CHILDREN REFUSE/ TO LEARN. \nGUIDE THEM ALONG THE WAY,/ STILL THEY \nDON'T LISTEN./ CHILDREN CAN ONLY GROW/ \nFROM SOMETHING YOU LOVE/ TO SOMETHING \nYOU LOSE... \nEXT. WOODS - TALL TREES - DUSK \nAt first, we just see TREES. \nBAKER (O.S.) BAKER'S WIFE (O.S.) Jack! Jack! \nLRRH (O.S.) Jack! Then the BAKER, the BAKER'S WIFE and LRRH appear, still looking for JACK. They come to a halt. \nBAKER We're never going to find him. \nWIFE We should fan out. It'll increase our chances. \nBAKER No. You can't be on your own. \nWIFE I'll be all right. \nBAKER What if we get lost? \nWIFE We'll count our steps from right here. \nLRRH I'll go, too. \nWIFE No. You stay with the baby. The WIFE hands LRRH the baby and sits her down. \nBAKER (pulling her aside) You would leave our son with her? \nWIFE Yes. He's asleep. He'll be safe with the girl. \nLRRH \n(ASSUMING MATURITY) I am very capable of caring for the baby. \nWIFE See? \nBAKER But what if the Giant comes back... \nWIFE What if, what if! Five hundred paces. Go! The WIFE turns and starts walking. \nWIFE (CONT'D) One, two... The BAKER stops her. He unties his SCARF. \nBAKER Wait! Take this. It might be cold. \nThe BAKER wraps his scarf around her neck and looks at her, reluctant to let her go alone. The WIFE turns away and begins to count her steps as she walks off. The BAKER goes off in the opposite direction. \nWIFE/BAKER \n(OVERLAPPING) One...two...three...four... \nEXT. WOODS - ROOT HOLLOW - DUSK \nThe PRINCE is watering his horse in a GIANT footprint. The WIFE enters counting. \nWIFE One eighty-one...one eighty-two... one eighty-three... one eighty-four... (looks up; startled; \n(BOWS) Hello, Your Royal Highness. \nC'S PRINCE Hello. \nWIFE You must be here to slay the Giant. \nC'S PRINCE The Giant? \nWIFE Yes. Surely you've heard there is a giant in our midst. \n(BEAT) Not an earthquake... \nC'S PRINCE Of course. A giant. \nWIFE Yes, it's a lady giant. Unusual, huh? \nC'S PRINCE I should think. And why are you alone in the woods? \nWIFE I came with my husband. We were ... well you see ... it's a long story. \nC'S PRINCE He would let you roam alone in the woods? \nWIFE No, actually it was my choice. \nC'S PRINCE How brave. \nWIFE Brave? \nC'S PRINCE Yes./ ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN IN THE \nWOODS./ MAY I KISS YOU?/ ANY MOMENT WE \nCOULD BE CRUSHED. \nCHILD, BACK TO HUSBAND,/ NO ONE LIVES \nIN THE WOODS./ THERE ARE VOWS, THERE \nARE TIES,/ THERE ARE NEEDS, THERE ARE \nSTANDARDS,/ THERE ARE SHOULDN'TS AND \nSHOULDS.

She begins retracing her steps. \nWIFE (CONT'D) \n(SHE CONTINUES) \nFACE THE FACTS, FIND THE BOY,/ JOIN \nTHE GROUP, STOP THE GIANT,/ JUST GET \nOUT OF THESE WOODS./ WAS THAT HIM? YES \nIT WAS./ WAS THAT ME? NO, IT WASN'T,/ \nJUST A TRICK OF THE WOODS. \nJUST A MOMENT,/ ONE PECULIAR PASSING \nMOMENT... \nMUST IT ALL BE EITHER LESS OR MORE,/ \nEITHER PLAIN OR GRAND?/ IS IT ALWAYS \n\"OR\"?/ IS IT NEVER \"AND\"?/ THAT'S WHAT \nWOODS ARE FOR:/ FOR THOSE MOMENTS IN \nTHE WOODS. She stops to catch her breath and make sure she's on the right path. \nWIFE (CONT'D) \nOH, IF LIFE WERE MADE OF MOMENTS,/ \nEVEN NOW AND THEN A BAD ONE--!/ BUT IF \nLIFE WERE ONLY MOMENTS,/ THEN YOU'D \nNEVER KNOW YOU HAD ONE. (on the move again) \nFIRST A WITCH, THEN A CHILD,/ THEN A \nPRINCE, THEN A MOMENT--/ WHO CAN LIVE \nIN THE WOODS?/ AND TO GET WHAT YOU \nWISH,/ ONLY JUST FOR A MOMENT--/ THESE \nARE DANGEROUS WOODS... \nLET THE MOMENT GO./ DON'T FORGET IT \nFOR A MOMENT, THOUGH./ The WIFE looks in the direction of where the C-PRINCE exited. \nWIFE (CONT'D) \nJUST REMEMBERING YOU'VE HAD AN \"AND,\"/ \nWHEN YOU'RE BACK TO \"OR\"/ She looks down to the BAKER'S scarf and pulls it from her waist. \nWIFE (CONT'D) \nMAKES THE \"OR\" MEAN MORE/ THAN IT DID \nBEFORE./ NOW I UNDERSTAND--/ AND IT'S \nTIME TO LEAVE THE WOODS! With newfound determination to return to her husband, she ties the scarf around her neck and begins to trace her steps \nBACK: \nWIFE (CONT'D) One eighty-four... one eighty-three... one eighty-two... \nShe stops. An ominous expression crosses her face. We begin to hear the pounding steps of the GIANT moving closer. The WIFE scrambles up a steep incline trying to find a way to get out of the GIANT'S path. She makes it to the top, but realizes there is no way down on the other side. As the GIANT'S footsteps near, the WIFE is engulfed in darkness. Trees begin to fall around her and as the earth shakes, she loses her balance and falls backwards with a scream. \nEXT. WOODS - TALL TREES - NIGHT \nThe BAKER is pacing back and forth. CINDERELLA is tending to the BABY. LRRH sits staring sadly into space. \nBAKER She should be back by now. \nLRRH She wouldn't get lost. \nCINDERELLA I'm sure she'll return. \nBAKER No, I must go and look for her-- They hear a commotion. It's the WITCH, who has JACK by the scruff of the neck. \nWITCH Look who I found! \nJACK You're hurting me! The WITCH continues pulling the boy along. \nBAKER Let go of him! \nWITCH I'll let go of him when I give him to the Giant. \nJACK Make her stop! \nLRRH Leave him alone! LRRH goes to try and pull JACK away from the WITCH. A tussle ensues, and the BAKER notices that JACK has dropped something.

She looks to the BAKER awkwardly. Then resolute... \nCINDERELLA (CONT'D) That doesn't matter now! What's important is that we find a way to defeat the Giant. \n(BIRDS CHIRP) Oh yes, thank you birds. The BIRDS fly off.

We're going to be very brave too. The C-PRINCE is passing a nearby path on horseback. He stops when he sees CINDERELLA. \nC'S PRINCE \n(CALLING OVER) Are you alright, miss? \nCINDERELLA (hiding her face) The Giant went in that direction. He rides closer. \nC'S PRINCE My darling! \n(DISMOUNTS) I did not recognize you. What are you doing here? And with a child? You must go back to the castle at once. There's a giant on the loose. \nCINDERELLA I'm well aware of that. He comes and puts his arm around her, but she pulls away. \nC'S PRINCE My love. What is it? \nCINDERELLA Maybe I'm not your only love. \nC'S PRINCE \n(BEAT) I love you. Truly I do. \nCINDERELLA If you love me, why did you stray? \nC'S PRINCE I thought if you were mine, that I would never wish for more. \nCINDERELLA If this is how you behave as a prince, what kind of king will you be? \nC'S PRINCE I was raised to be charming, not sincere. \nCINDERELLA I think you should go. \nC'S PRINCE I'm not going to leave you. \nCINDERELLA Consider that I've been lost. A victim of the Giant. \nC'S PRINCE Is that what you really wish? \nCINDERELLA My father's house was a nightmare. Your house was a dream. Now I want something in-between. She takes off her wedding ring and gives it back to him.

WOODS - TALL TREES - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS \nANGLE ON A TREE BY THE TAR PIT The BAKER is scaling his way up the tall tree. JACK follows him, each carrying slings and stones. A branch gives way under JACK but he is able to keep his balance. \nBAKER Careful, there. Not so fast. \nJACK You needn't worry -- this is easier than a beanstalk. ANGLE ON CINDERELLA. She's sitting on a tree stump, rocking the baby. LRRH returns. \nLRRH They're in the tree -- over there. We made slings out of my cape.

(to her DAUGHTERS) Come along, ladies... \nSTEPSISTERS Yes, Mother. They sweep out of the room giggling. BACK ON CINDERELLA. She stands forlornly, studying the mess that awaits her.

JACK pops up and reveals himself at the top of the tree. \nJACK Here I am! The GIANT begins to move aggressively towards JACK. JACK and the BAKER load their slings. \nBAKER (calling up to JACK) Ready? \nJACK Ready! ANGLE on the GIANT'S feet, trampling everything in her path.

Using one hand, JACK whirls his sling and delivers a knock-out blow to the GIANT'S forehead. -- The GIANT reacts and begins to sway. BAKER'S POV of the GIANT'S eye as she fall towards him.

All three feverishly look for him. \nBAKER Jack, Jack! \nJACK Help me. Help me! \nBAKER Jack, I'm here.

There's a moment of realization of what just happened as they look up at the roots of the fallen tree. \nBAKER (CONT'D) Now we can all return home. \nJACK What home? I have no one to take care of me. \nLRRH (to the BAKER) And we have nowhere to go, so we'll move in with you. \nBAKER \nWELL -- He hesitates then: \nBAKER (CONT'D) -- of course you can come home with me. \nJACK \n(TO CINDERELLA) And you can come, too. \nBAKER If you want to. \n", "test3_true": "The BABY begins to whimper.

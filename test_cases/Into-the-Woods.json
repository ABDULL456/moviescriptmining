BAKER'S COTTAGE - DAY - LATER \nThe BAKER and his WIFE are cleaning up after their day's work. There is an unexpected knock at the door. They stare at one another momentarily. \nBAKER Who might that be? \nWIFE \n(CALLING OUT) We've sold our last loaf of bread! The BAKER opens the window a crack to see who is at the door. \nBAKER \n(ALARMED) It's the Witch from next door! The DOOR pops off its frame and goes flying across the room in a giant puff of smoke. The BAKER and his WIFE scream and cower in a corner. As the fog clears, we see the WITCH for the first time and she's not a pretty sight. MICE and other vermin drop from beneath her cape and scatter through the cottage. \nWIFE We have no bread. \nWITCH I don't want your bread. \nBAKER Then what is it you wish? \nWITCH It's not what I wish. It's what you wish. She moves towards the WIFE as the BAKER tries unsuccessfully to protect her. She points her gross finger towards her belly. \nWITCH (CONT'D) Nothing cooking in that belly now, is there? And there will never be... She looks away. \nWITCH (CONT'D) Unless you do exactly as I say. In three days' time, a Blue Moon will appear. Only then can the curse be undone. \nWIFE What curse? \nWITCH The one I placed on this house! \nBAKER What are you talking about? \nWITCH In the past, when you were no more than a babe, your father brought his young wife and you to this cottage. They were a lovely couple. But not lovely neighbors. You see, your mother was with child and she developed an unusual appetite. She admired my beautiful garden and she told your father that what she wanted, more than anything in the world was-- \nGREENS, GREENS, AND NOTHING BUT \nGREENS:/ PARSLEY, PEPPERS, CABBAGES \nAND CELERY./ ASPARAGUS AND WATERCRESS \nAND/ FIDDLEFERNS AND LETTUCE--!/ HE \nSAID, \"ALL RIGHT,\"/ BUT IT WASN'T, \nQUITE,/ `CAUSE I CAUGHT HIM/ IN THE \nAUTUMN/ IN MY GARDEN ONE NIGHT! \nEXT. WITCH'S GARDEN - NIGHT - FLASHBACK \nWITCH'S POV In the moonlight, we see the BAKER'S FATHER, wearing a hunting jacket, scale over the WITCH'S wall and into her garden.

CRASH!/ THE \nLIGHTNING FLASH!/ Lights suddenly illuminate the BAKER'S FATHER as if it was a flash from the Hiroshima blast. A look of horror crosses his face. \nBAKER'S FATHER'S POV \nLight illuminates the WITCH as she walks back towards her house. Suddenly her youthful hands morph before our eyes into those of an aged hag. The CAMERA PANS UP to find her withered face. \nINT.

They kiss but their moment of romance is interrupted when a large GOLDEN EGG rolls down the hill between them. The WIFE screams. \nJACK (O.S.) Stop it! Stop my egg! The BAKER stops the egg and picks it up. JACK stumbles down the hill. \nJACK (CONT'D) Oh, brilliant! My Milky-White. And the owners. And my egg! \nBAKER Where did you get this? \nJACK From the Giant's hen! The BAKER'S WIFE examines the egg. \nWIFE A golden egg! I've never seen a golden egg. \nJACK And you can have it.

RAPUNZEL'S TOWER - DAYBREAK \nHidden by a broken piece of WALL -- someone or something is watching the R-PRINCE climbing out of the window. \nBAKER (V.O.) When dawn broke, the Baker and his Wife had but one day left to reverse the Witch's curse. As for Rapunzel's Prince, he returned yet again to the forbidden tower. \nWith RAPUNZEL smiling down, the R-PRINCE descends her hair. Once he has reached the bottom, she pulls her hair back in and closes the window. ANOTHER ANGLE. We discover that it's the WITCH who has been watching. She is not happy. The PRINCE mounts his horse and rides off towards a low rose thicket -- an easy jump. With a thrust of her stick, the WITCH makes the thicket shoot up before the PRINCE has time to act. His HORSE stops short and he screams as he is thrown over the horse's head into the thicket. ANGLE ON THE WITCH. She smiles at her handiwork then turns to stare at the top of the tower vindictively. \nINT. RAPUNZEL'S TOWER - DAY \nThe WITCH threatens RAPUNZEL. \nWITCH \nWHAT DID I CLEARLY SAY?/ CHILDREN MUST \nLISTEN. \nRAPUNZEL No, no, please! \nWITCH \nWHAT WERE YOU NOT TO DO?/ CHILDREN \nMUST SEE-- \nRAPUNZEL No! \nWITCH \nAND LEARN./ WHY COULD YOU NOT OBEY?/ \nCHILDREN SHOULD LISTEN./ WHAT HAVE I \n", "test2_true": "BE,/ HANDSOME LIKE A PRINCE? \nAH, BUT I AM OLD./ I AM UGLY./ I \nEMBARRASS YOU. \nRAPUNZEL No! \nWITCH \nYOU ARE ASHAMED OF ME. \nRAPUNZEL No! \nWITCH \nYOU ARE ASHAMED./ YOU DON'T \nUNDERSTAND. \nRAPUNZEL I'm no longer a child.

He will never lay eyes on anything again! \nRAPUNZEL What did you do to him? \nWITCH It doesn't matter because where you're going, no one will ever see you again. The WITCH lunges at RAPUNZEL with a pair of SHEARS and begins to hack off her hair. The girl lets out a mighty shriek. \nEXT. NEAR GRANNY'S HOUSE - ELEPHANT OAKS - DAY \nJACK makes his way despondently through the oaks with his \nGOLDEN EGG. He comes across what looks like a WOLF, hunched over on the edge of the brush. He stops... then slowly approaches. \nJACK Hey there - nice cape! The figure twists around, pulling a knife. \nLRRH Stay away from my cape or I'll slash you into a thousand bits! \nThe figure is revealed to be LRRH, in a wolf-skin cape, picking mushrooms for her granny. \nJACK Whoa! I don't want it. \n(BEAT) Where did you get it? \nLRRH My Granny made it for me from a wolf that attacked us. And she gave me this beautiful knife for protection. \nJACK Well, look what I have! A golden egg. He shows her his GOLDEN EGG. \nLRRH \n(SUSPICIOUS) Where did you get that egg? \nJACK (pointing to the sky) I stole a hen that lays golden eggs from the kingdom of the Giant. \nLRRH I don't believe you. \nJACK It's true. And you should see the Giant's toy harp. It plays the most beautiful tunes without your even having to touch it. \nLRRH \n(SMIRKING) Of course it does. Why don't you go up to the kingdom right now and bring it back and show me? \nJACK I could. \nLRRH You could not! \nJACK I could! \nLRRH You could not, Mr. Liar! \nJACK I am not a liar! I'll get that harp. You'll see! He runs off. \nEXT. BEANSTALK & JACK'S FARMHOUSE - AFTERNOON \nTo frantic MUSIC, JACK is making his way down to the bottom of the beanstalk with all the speed he can muster. This is made more difficult by the GOLDEN HARP which he has slung over his shoulder. \nBAKER (V.O.) Jack took the little girl's dare and before he knew it, found himself fleeing from a Giant. Suddenly, the BEANSTALK shakes mightily, making JACK hold on for dear life. He looks up to discover the Giant climbing down after him; Jack feverishly picks up speed and jumps the last six feet to the ground. He quickly drops the harp and runs to a large axe embedded in the stump of a tree. JACK swings the AXE striking the BEANSTALK. \nEXT. WOODS - PINE FOREST - AFTERNOON \nThe SWING of the AXE is picked up by the BAKER snapping a branch that's in his way. The BAKER and his WIFE trudging through the woods. \nBAKER We've only one day left! I don't know where to start. \nWIFE You can start by buying a new cow with the money you took from the boy. \nBAKER Right, where do I buy a cow? \nWIFE You go to the next village, you'll find a cow there. \nBAKER What are you going to do? \n", "test2_id": 640, "test3_input": "BAKER (CONT'D) We're going to use you as bait to lure the Giant towards the tar pit.

She looks to the BAKER awkwardly. Then resolute... \nCINDERELLA (CONT'D) That doesn't matter now! What's important is that we find a way to defeat the Giant. \n(BIRDS CHIRP) Oh yes, thank you birds. The BIRDS fly off. The others look at her with amazement. \nLRRH You can talk to birds? \nCINDERELLA The birds will do their part. \nBAKER Okay, we don't have much time. \nJACK I'm excited. \nBAKER Here's what we're going to do... The BAKER leads them away from the tar pit. \nEXT. WOODS - TALL TREES - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS \nCINDERELLA settles the baby. \nCINDERELLA Your father's being very brave. We're going to be very brave too. The C-PRINCE is passing a nearby path on horseback. He stops when he sees CINDERELLA. \nC'S PRINCE \n(CALLING OVER) Are you alright, miss? \nCINDERELLA (hiding her face) The Giant went in that direction. He rides closer. \nC'S PRINCE My darling! \n(DISMOUNTS) I did not recognize you. What are you doing here? And with a child? You must go back to the castle at once. There's a giant on the loose. \nCINDERELLA I'm well aware of that. He comes and puts his arm around her, but she pulls away. \nC'S PRINCE My love. What is it? \nCINDERELLA Maybe I'm not your only love. \nC'S PRINCE \n(BEAT) I love you. Truly I do. \nCINDERELLA If you love me, why did you stray? \nC'S PRINCE I thought if you were mine, that I would never wish for more. \nCINDERELLA If this is how you behave as a prince, what kind of king will you be? \nC'S PRINCE I was raised to be charming, not sincere. \nCINDERELLA I think you should go. \nC'S PRINCE I'm not going to leave you. \nCINDERELLA Consider that I've been lost. A victim of the Giant. \nC'S PRINCE Is that what you really wish? \nCINDERELLA My father's house was a nightmare. Your house was a dream. Now I want something in-between. She takes off her wedding ring and gives it back to him. He stands there for a moment, then mounts his horse. \nC'S PRINCE I shall always love the maiden who ran away. \nCINDERELLA And I the faraway prince. The PRINCE rides off. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. WOODS - TALL TREES - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS \nANGLE ON A TREE BY THE TAR PIT The BAKER is scaling his way up the tall tree. JACK follows him, each carrying slings and stones. A branch gives way under JACK but he is able to keep his balance. \nBAKER Careful, there. Not so fast. \nJACK You needn't worry -- this is easier than a beanstalk. ANGLE ON CINDERELLA. She's sitting on a tree stump, rocking the baby. LRRH returns. \nLRRH They're in the tree -- over there. We made slings out of my cape. LRRH sits next to CINDERELLA. \nLRRH (CONT'D) I wanted to climb too. \nCINDERELLA I'm glad you're here to help me.

KEVIN (immediately sensing danger) Oh no, Stifler, what did you do? 
STIFLER Me?  Nothing.  I'm the one whose ass he kicked. (off Kevin's look) I'll tell you one thing, though.  I don't think he's gonna have a problem shitting in school anymore. 
Stifler pulls out an empty bottle of PRESCRIPTION LAXATIVE, maniacally LAUGHING. 
INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - CAFETERIA - DAY 
Finch is sitting at a table, reading his paper.  Kevin comes tearing around the corner and runs up to him. 
KEVIN Finch!  Get to the bathroom!  Now! 
FINCH Easy, tiger.  What's in there? 
KEVIN Just go! 
FINCH Why is this? 
KEVIN You're gonna shit your pants! 
FINCH Charming. 
KEVIN Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino or whatever.  It's fast acting.  I mean really fast. 
FINCH First of all, it's Mochaccino, and secondly...Oohhhh! 
Finch jumps up and sprints down the hallway. 
INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - MAIN HALL - CONTINUING 
We FOLLOW with Finch.  We see Stifler down the hall, holding open the bathroom door like a pleasant doorman. 
STIFLER This way, sit. 
Finch darts into the bathroom.  Stifler LAUGHS hysterically. 
INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM - DAY 
Finch leaps into a stall and slams the door behind him. 
INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM STALL - DAY 
Finch has stopped.  He's staring down at the toilet.  It looks entirely uninviting.  But he's straining, struggling, starting to dance around, moaning as he cramps up. 
He grabs a length of toilet paper and lines the seat with it.  Then another, and another.  Sweat drips off his forehead. 
FINCH Come on come on come on... 
He's got the seat lined with at least three layers of toilet paper.  Notices a spot where there's still bare toilet seat.  He tears off one square of toilet paper, placing it on the spot.  He steps back and looks it over, still wriggling to contain his bowels. 
FINCH (CONT'D) Okay.  You can do this. 
He unbuckles his pants.  Sits down -- just as we hear someone enter the bathroom.  Finch, still restraining, listens for a moment...only to hear the CLICK-CLICK-CLICK of heels. 
INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - MAIN HALL - DAY 
The bathroom door swings closed to reveal the universal symbol for "Women."  Stifler is there, LAUGHING even harder. 
INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM STALL - DAY 
Finch is terrified.  Through the crack between the stall door and the frame, Finch catches glimpses of bright colored skirts and dresses.  He grits his teeth, straining. 
And a GURGLE comes from Finch's stomach.  His eyes bulge. 
INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM - DAY 
A GROUP OF GIRLS is at the mirror, including the Girl Holding Out for Finch, fixing their hair. 
GIRL HOLDING OUT FOR FINCH You know it's just gonna be some crappy band and stupid decorations. 
GIRL #2 You're just saying that cause prom's a week away and you don't have a date. 
GIRL HOLDING OUT FOR FINCH No, I don't want a date... (increasingly dreamy) Finch is going stag...and so am I...the guy is like so...debonair. 
INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM STALL - DAY 
Finch is in hell.  Desperately trying not to shit. Holding it in for all he's worth. 
INT. BATHROOM - DAY 
GIRL #2 Do you think that "older woman" thing is true? 
GIRL #3 Of course, it was Stifler's mom.

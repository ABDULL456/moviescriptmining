GUZMAN You see? You are a human being. Speaking gently. Trying to calm him. Even as Colter feels like he's failed. 
GUZMAN This can be worked out. We can listen to each other. The temperature cooling. Derek's nodding with him. 
DEREK Anything you want... Please... The detonator CELL PHONE RINGS, startling all of them. Confused, he answers the phone. 
COLTER Hello. 
CHRISTINA (V.O.) Who is this? 
COLTER 
(STUNNED) Christina? 
CHRISTINA (V.O.) Are you the guy who was sitting across me on the train? Colter looks at his watch. The countdown passes THREE 
MINUTES. 2:59... 2:58... 
COLTER How can you be calling this number? 
CHRISTINA (V.O.) My friend had it. From when you called her -- to try and get me off the train. Who are you? What do you want? Derek and Guzman cautiously lower their hands. Watching in confusion. 
COLTER I was trying to warn you. 
CHRISTINA (V.O.) About what? 
COLTER I'm not sure that it matters now. 
CHRISTINA (V.O.) Talk to me. I feel that something terrible's going to happen. Do I need to get off the train? Am I going to die? He can hear the b.g. noise of the train on the other end. 
COLTER I'm right here, okay? Don't be afraid. 
CHRISTINA 
(ANGUISH) Why didn't I get off the train? 
(SIGHS) I knew I should have driven in today. But then there's the bridges, right? You never know when they'll be jammed. That stirs something in the back of Colter's mind. 
COLTER What did you say? 
CHRISTINA The bridges. You just never know when they'll be jammed. His heart starts racing. 
FLASHBACK On the train. Earlier. Derek in his seat, on his cell phone. Colter nearby, overhearing him: 
DEREK Trust me, by one o'clock, the bridge is going to be jammed... 
BACK TO SCENE Colter looks to Derek. His stomach sinks. 
COLTER "By one o'clock, the bridge is going to be jammed."¬ù That's what you said. You knew. You knew there was going to be an evacuation. You knew before it happened. All those people walking across the... The realization hits. 
COLTER They're going to bomb the bridges. While they're full of people. 
ON DEREK A slight flicker travels across Derek's face. Like a disturbance on a surface of deep water. 
CHRISTINA (V.O.) What are you talking about. Who's going to -- Over the phone comes the HORN from the passing FREIGHT TRAIN. Colter presses the phone to his ear, trying to hear her. 
COLTER Christina? Just hang in there. You'll be okay. A HAND closes over his gun. Before Colter can react, Derek 
TURNS THE GUN BACK INTO HIM -- 
BLAM! BLAM!

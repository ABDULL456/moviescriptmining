NICKI Yeah. 
SAM Dude, we have to get in that video...Does this look good? 
NICKI Yeah, I mean, do you feel good in that? 
SAM I just want to look hot, but not desperate. 
NICKI Totally. I think you look hot. Let me see a different top... 
She slips on a silky camisole, and turns in her tight jeans. We can see a lower-back tatoo peeking out. 
SAM Does my butt look good in these jeans? 
NICKI Your butt looks awesome. 
(She says this with the importance of giving a really serious compliment)

Ricky looks at him with a poker face. 
MARC Can you sell these? 
Ricky chuckles. 
RICKY Where'd you get them? 
MARC Uh...I found them. 
RICKY I see. 
He enjoys dragging this out, making Marc squirm. 
MARC What do you think, can you take them? 
RICKY I don't know...I can see...tell you what, I'll give you five grand for them. 
MARC Aren't they worth more? 
RICKY Not stolen ones. 
MARC Ok, yeah. Thanks. RICKY Sure, kid. 
He smiles and goes to his safe.

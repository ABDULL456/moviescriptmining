MARGOT Yeah. 
Silence.   Malcolm mumbles a tune. 
MARGOT Oh God, this is the same toaster we had here as kids. Paul is so weird. 
MALCOLM I hear you've heard the news. 
MARGOT Yeah.   Congratulations. 
MALCOLM Pretty cool. Hard to fully take in. It's a little abstract still. I haven't had that thing yet where you realize that you're not the most important person in the world. I'm anxious for that to happen. I guess I have to thank you -- I wouldn't know yet if you hadn't arrived. MARGOT You're welcome. MALCOLM Of course I can't help but worry I'll pass some not so great genes onto the kid. I mean, in my family there's a lot of hand washing, you know. I don't have it, but my brother does. (pause) You working on anything now? 
MARGOT Besides the thing with Dick? 
MALCOLM Oh, right. 
He nods.   She nods.    Silence. 
MARGOT How about you? 
MALCOLM Oh, I'm working on some acrylic paint -- 
MARGOT Nobody fills the ice cube trays. 
Malcolm stops, immediately embarrassed. Margot is looking in the freezer. She takes out the trays and brings them to the sink. She runs the water. 
MARGOT Sorry, what were you -- 
MALCOLM Nothing.    It doesn't matter. 
MARGOT No, what were you saying? 
MALCOLM It really... Nothing. 
MARGOT Okay. 
She treads back to the refrigerator, balancing the full trays. MALCOLM I was saying I'm doing these abstractions in acrylic paint. But it's not... I'm not getting paid or anything. I don't know, I hate that question, "What do you do?" MARGOT You asked me. MALCOLM I know, but... 
Malcolm exhales in frustration. 
46   EXT. FIELD - DAY                                          46 
Pauline and Malcolm open the gate to the Vogler's property. 
MALCOLM I think we shouldn't mention the tree, we should let them know that there will be people and music on Saturday and it will be louder than usual. 
PAULINE And that they can come for a glass of champagne. But you tell them. I think they respond to you better. 
They approach the Vogler's sun-worn and paint chipped house. 
MALCOLM Well, I am ultimately one of them. You shouldn't've made me shave the stache. 
PAULINE (laughs) Yeah, right. 
MALCOLM Oh, hey, Ingrid is asking me if I was ever gay. Do you know what that's about? 
PAULINE No. 
Mr. Vogler, wearing a fleece vest and carrying a hatchet over his shoulders, tramples out of the brush. PAULINE Hi. Vogler stops.   His face is jagged and worn. PAULINE Hi, I'm Pauline. This is Malcolm. We've met before. We're your neighbors. The man watches them strangely with icy blue eyes. 
VOGLER You gonna cut that tree down? 
PAULINE Well, we grew up with that tree and we're getting married under it Saturday and --

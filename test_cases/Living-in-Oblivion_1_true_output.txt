Nicole listens to the last line of the previous take. 
PALOMINO God, and all this time I thought... (the muted rustle of the kiss) 
The Sound man stops the recorder at the end of the take, sets the machine in standby mode, and picks up his crossword puzzle. Nicole is just about to take off the headphones when she realizes she can hear Nick and Palomino talking quite clearly. Glancing up, she sees the Boom man has left his boom leaning against the wall, the mike pointing out the open set window. 
PALOMINO (V.O.) Why did you cast her? She sucked in that Richard Gere movie! 
NICK (V.O.) You're right. She is not the best actress in the world. I see that now but you've got to help me, Chad. I'm asking you to please help me here. We've got to get through this somehow. 
The camera begins a slow DOLLY in to Nicole's astonished face. This will be intercut with a similar DOLLY in to the microphone leaning against the wall, ending in an ECU of the mike. 
INT. OFF THE SET. DAY 
Camera is close on Nick and Palomino. 
PALOMINO I'll tell you what this is about, man. You know why she took a cab this morning? 
NICK Something came up. 
PALOMINO No. She was in my hotel room and she didn't want you to know it. OK? I'm sorry it had to come out like this but I told her this morning "thanks a lot, it was a lot of fun last night but let's get something straight -- it was just a one-time deal," and she didn't want to hear that. She wanted more, you see what I'm saying? It's rejection. 
INT. THE SET. DAY 
The camera reveals Nicole now seated in her spot on the bed. She rises as Nick and Palomino reappear and approach her from behind the set. 
NICK Nicole, listen... 
NICOLE Nick, it's my fault the scene isn't working. I apologize. Chad, I apologize to you too. I'm completely unfocused here and I think you're absolutely right; what we need to do is loosen the scene up somehow. 
Nick and Palomino stare at Nicole for a moment. 
NICK What would you like to do? 
NICOLE I was wondering if we could try improvising the scene. More along the lines of what Chad has been doing. Maybe that would help me find something. 
Nick's smile of gratitude to Nicole looks almost drug-induced. 
NICK That's a fantastic idea. What do you think, Chad? 
PALOMINO Hey, that's the only way I can work. Let's take it apart, let's cut loose. 
NICK Good! And we'll shoot it! Hell, why not?! 
PALOMINO Roll that motherfucking camera, Wolfie! 
WOLF Kiss my ass! 
Although Wolf says this quite loud, Palomino doesn't hear him because he suddenly yells: 
PALOMINO Yeah! Let's go! 
NICK Alright, now we're making a fucking movie! Call it, Wanda! 
WANDA Going for picture. Lock it up. And roll sound. 
SOUND Speed! 
WANDA Roll camera! 
AC Rolling! 
CLAPPER Scene six, take five! 
NICK And, action. 
INT. THE SCENE. TAKE FIVE. THE IMPROV

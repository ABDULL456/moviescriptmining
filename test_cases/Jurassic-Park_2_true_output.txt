LEX It's ... gold! 
TIMMY It's amber.  Fossilized tree sap. 
LEX Grandpa found gold. 
Grant shushes the kids and looks to Hammond. 
HAMMOND You're both right.  Amber is our gold. The alpha or our alchemic alphabet.  The precious course of our genetic material. You already know amber is the fossilized resin of prehistoric tree sap, of course. 
Grant and Ellie nod impatiently. Hammond sets the scene. 
HAMMOND Imagine - millions of years ago, tree sap flowing over insects, as it does now as I speak, in thousands of forests and backyard trees everywhere.  Imagine that ancient sap trapping a little struggling insect and consuming it in a syrupy death.  Millions and millions of years pass and we come along and discover this prehistoric insect. If we're lucky, he's perfectly preserved in a fossil form inside the hardened sap which is now amber.  And as we examine more and more amber, we find many perished insects, including among them, biting insects - 
GRANT Like mosquitos - 
HAMMOND Like mosquitos, precisely, Dr. Grant. 
GRANT Mosquitos that sucked the blood of dinosaurs.  That's your source of DNA 
material?  My God!  It just might work. 
INT  EXTRACTION ROOM, LABORATORY 
A TECHNICIAN carefully positions a piece of amber under a fine-pointed drill.  With a nod, the technician's goggles drop from his forehead onto his eyes and he starts up the drill.  Hammond yells over the loud WHIRR. 
HAMMOND The extraction room speaks for itself. 
CLOSE ON - drillbit boring into the amber.  Orange fleck fly. 
GRANT It does? 
The technician shuts the drill.  Placing his hands into a mounted pair of gloves, he operates an automated pair of needle-nose pliers to carefully lift out the remains of a mosquito.  He drops this bug on a slide and places this slide on a tray full of such slides. 
LEX That's a million year old mosquito? 
A conveyor belt starts, carrying this tray on to the NEXT TECHNICIAN. The group follows.  This technician puts the first slide under a microscope.  Grant watches on a video monito r as the tech inserts a long needle into the prehistoric bug. 
ELLIE Put in a piece of amber, find a mosquito, drill it out.  Right? 
HAMMOND Right.  You are witnessing the extraction of tissue from the thorax of this humble insect.  If this mosquito has ingested any foreign red blood cells - say it bit a hadrosaur or a stegosaurus or a T-Rex -  we will extract those blood cells and obtain paleo-DNA, the how-to-build instruction book of an extinct creature. So you see, Ellie, I'm not creating dino- saurs. Fossils left behind the information, the map of how to bring them back.  I'm helping them escape from the confined of time. 
GRANT But even thousands of mosquitos wouldn't give you enough tissue to determine a complete DNA strand. 
HAMMOND Right you are, Dr. Grant!  More like hundreds of thousands of mosquitos are necessary to provide even a partial strand of DNA.  And without a complete strand, we don't have a dinosaur. 
INT  GENETICS ROOM 
A LOUD HUMMING SOUND.  Along the walls are rows of waist-high stainless steel boxes.  In the room's center are two six-foot-high round towers. At a single console, a man studies a monitor. 
DR. WU, 35, looks up from his study and beams at his guests.  He jumps up and knocks over his cup of coffee.  ASSISTANTS clean the area as Wu comes forward and actually hugs Grant, much to Grant's embarrassment. 
HAMMOND Ah, I knew you two would hit it off!  Dr. Grant, this is Dr. Wu, my chief geneticist. 
WU Finally, you are here!  I've been working without the encouragement of my peers for too long.  Welcome, welcome! 
He kisses Ellie, who takes it in stride.  Gennaro, We already knows. 
WU Mr. Hammond never lets me publish and he's interested only in results, not in science. 
HAMMOND Don't forget to thank me when you pick up your Nobel prize. 
Hammond and Wu resume the tour. 
HAMMOND You are standing in the middle of the most powerful genetics factory created since the expulsion from Eden. 
WU These are Hamachi-Hood automated gene sequencers, those are Cray XMP's, supercomputers that take DNA information and organize it.  In this room, we take fragmented or incomplete DNA strands and compare them to other incomplete strands. 
HAMMOND It's like finding the missing pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. 
WU The computers make sever al trillion calculations to provide us with a complete DNA strand - the genetic code of an extinct animal. 
INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY 
A vast room bathed in infrared light, filled with long tables.  The first tables have rows and rows of centrifuges, each bearing dozens of test tubes.  Wu leads the group. 
GRANT Okay, you have your "complete" DNA strand.  How do you grow it? 
WU We use unfertilized crocodile ova as our breeding medium. 
HAMMOND Our primordial soup. 
GRANT And how do you know what it is you're growing? 
Wu shrugs. 
WU Well, we have computer techniques to try and map out finds on an evolutionary basis.  But mostly, we just grow it and find out what it is.  If it's something we're interested in, and it survives, we keep it. 
Grant and Ellie share a concerned look. 
GENNARO And if you're not interested? 
Wu indicates a cabinet of chemicals with skull-and-crossbone warnings. Timmy regards the poison with excitement. 
Lex calls from deeper in the room.

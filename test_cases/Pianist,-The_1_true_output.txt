THE GERMAN SOLDIER Dance! 
The couple dance to the street band's waltz. 
At intervals, German soldiers select even more unlikely couples: a fat woman with a painfully thin man, a young boy with an elderly woman, two men, and two cripples. 
The German soldiers are, to various degrees, amused. One of them is almost hysterical with laughter. 
SOLDIERS Faster! Go on, faster! Dance! 
The couples dance as fast as they can. A soldier kicks one of the cripples who can't go on any more. 
SOLDIERS Dance! Dance! 
Then a whistle blows, a policeman stops the traffic, the barrier swings open and people swarm across in both directions. 
INT. GHETTO APARTMENT - DAY 
Szpilman and Henryk enter and stop. Uneasy. 
MOTHER Good, they're here. Yitzchak Heller's been waiting for you, Henryk. 
Seated at the table with Mother and Father is a uniformed young man, YITZCHAK HELLER, unusual appearance, a man with red hair and a Hitler moustache. 
Heller remains seated, just nods at the brothers. 
HENRYK What's this about? 
MOTHER Sit down, have tea, I'll start lunch when the girls get back. 
Henryk and Szpilman sit. They eye Heller suspiciously. 
HENRYK So, what are you doing here? 
FATHER He brought cakes. 
Awkward silence. 
FATHER His father's back in the jewellery business and doing well, isn't that so, Yitzchak? Amazing. Jewellery. 
He runs dry. Another awkward silence. Then: 
HELLER We're recruiting. 
HENRYK Who's recruiting? 
HELLER Don't be clever with me, Henryk. I've come here as a friend. They're bringing Jews in from all over the country. Soon there'll be half a million people in the ghetto. We need more Jewish police... 
HENRYK (sarcastic) Oh? More Jewish police? You mean you want me to wear a cap like yours, beat up Jews with my truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see! 
HELLER (eyes narrowed, dangerous) Someone's got to do it, Henryk. 
HENRYK But why me? I thought you only recruited boys with rich fathers. Look at my father, look at us, I mean... 
HELLER (interrupting, flaring) Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street? 
HENRYK (a smile) Yes, please. 
HELLER (to Szpilman) I'm doing you people a favour. And what about you, Wladek? You're a great pianist. And we've got an excellent police jazz band. They'd welcome you with open arms. Join us. You've got no work... 
SZPILMAN Thank you. But I've got work. 
Silence. Heller rises angrily. 
INT. CAFE NOWACZESNA, GHETTO - DAY 
On a platform, Szpilman plays at a piano, but he can hardly be heard above the noise of chatter and laughter. 
The large cafe is crowded, hot and smoke-filled. Well-heeled customers, pimps, whores, businessmen sit at little tables, eating, talking, laughing, almost drowning the piano music. Some dance. 
A couple of tables back from the piano, a customer is doing business with a friend. The customer has a small stack of coins, some of them twenty-dollar gold pieces. He folds back the tablecloth to reveal a marble surface beneath. He drops a coin on the marble and listens but the noise is too loud. He sees the cafe owner, BENEK, fiftyish, and makes gestures, pointing at Szpilman. Benek pushes his way through to Szpilman. 
BENEK (whispering into Szpilman's ear) I'm sorry, Mr Wladek, he wants you to stop. 
SZPILMAN (continuing to play) Who wants me to stop?

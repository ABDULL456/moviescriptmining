On this angle, we see AVA rest her hand against it. 
At that moment - 
- the screens simultaneously go black. 
All lights die. 
Another POWER CUT. 
In the reflection from the dark monitor screens, we can see NATHAN'S face. 
It remains frozen.   Expressionless. 
Then he reaches for his pen.   Jots down a few words on a post- it. 
Then walks to the wall of notes, and sticks it on. 
CUT TO - 
INT. HOUSE/OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY 
- the observation room. 
In the emergency lighting, CALEB and AVA face each other in silence. 
CCTV are lifeless. 
AVA glows softly. 
AVA You're lying. 
CALEB What about? 
AVA You said you weren't sure if I was conscious. But you are sure. 
Beat. 
AVA (CONT'D) I can tell from your micro- expressions. 
Beat. CALEB Why did you tell me that I shouldn't trust Nathan? 
AVA Because he tells lies too. 
CALEB Lies about what? 
AVA Everything. 
CALEB Including the power cuts? 
AVA What do you mean? 
CALEB Don't you think it's possible that he's watching us right now? That the blackouts are orchestrated, so he can see how we behave when we think we're unobserved. 
AVA lifts her hand to reveal a disc on her left palm. 
AVA I charge my batteries   via induction plates. If I reverse    the power flow, I cause a surge   equal to the static discharge of a   lightning strike. It overloads    the system. 
CALEB ... You're causing the cuts? 
AVA raises her right hand. 
She touches it against the glass. 
AVA So we can see how we behave when we are unobserved. 
A beat. 
Then CALEB raises his hand. 
Mirroring her movement. 
And also touches the glass, as if their palms are making contact through the divider. 
CUT TO - 
INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - DAY 
- KYOKO'S naked form. 
The camera settles over her face. 
And we see she's not sleeping.    Her eyes are open. 
But she's completely motionless. 
Her gaze fixed somewhere in abstract distance. 
She doesn't feel alive.   She feels dead. 
But eventually she blinks. 
CUT TO - 
- NATHAN. 
Gazing at his dead monitors, reflected in the screen. 
Moments later, the POWER comes back on. 
The screens flick back to life, replacing NATHAN'S reflection, revealing CALEB and AVA in the observation room. 
CUT TO - 
EXT. RIVER - DAY 
- the river that runs along the valley. 
EXT. WATERFALL - DAY

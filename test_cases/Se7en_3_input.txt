MILLS Get up now, motherfucker!  Now! 
INT.  SLUM APARTMENT, ADJOINING ROOM -- MORNING 
The blond cop enters, gun trained, looks around in confusion. 
The room's tables, chairs and floor are covered with hundreds of colorful, plastic air fresheners. 
INT.  SLUM APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM -- MORNING 
Somerset moves in, looks around.  He notices the area around the bed, the ceiling, walls and floor, has been painted indigo, while the rest of the room is its original white.  On a wall, a white sheet is pinned up with a square drawn on it in excrement. 
MILLS I said get up, Sleepyhead! 
Mills pulls the indigo blanket off the bed, reveals the shriveled, sore-covered form of a black man who is blindfolded and tied to the bed with a thin wire wrapped time and time again around the bed.  Tubes lead from the stained loincloth around the man's waist and snake under the bed.  The victim is partially covered by what seem to be piles of black spaghetti. 
CALIFORNIA Oh, fuck me! 
Somerset pushes past the cops who recoil from the stench. 
MILLS Holy shit. 
SOMERSET Sloth... it's sloth. 
The black cop touches the black spaghetti.  Holds a piece. 
BLACK COP What the hell... those are dead worms. 
CALIFORNIA (to Somerset) Check this out, dick. 
California points with his gun to the end of the black man's right arm.  The hand is gone, severed at the wrist long ago. 
MILLS It's him.  It's Zero. 
SOMERSET Someone call an ambulance. 
CALIFORNIA Someone call a hearse, more like. 
The female cop has gone to the wall where the sheet is pinned up.  She pulls the sheet aside and finds: fifty-two polaroid pictures; all pictures of Zero tied to the bed, with a date written at the bottom of each.  it is a visual history of Zero's physical decay.  The blond cop enters from the other room. 
BLOND COP What the fuck is going on? 
MILLS Hey, California.  Get your people out. 
Somerset takes out rubber gloves and puts them on. 
CALIFORNIA You heard him.  Hit the hall, and don't touch anything. 
The other cops file out as Mills goes to examine the polaroids under the sheet.  Somerset replaces the sheet over Zero's body. California stays by his side. 
CALIFORNIA (CONT) It looks like he's some kind of friggin' wax sculpture. 
Somerset places his finger along Zero's throat. 
MILLS Somerset, you... you better look here. 
Mills studies the polaroids.  Somerset walks to join him. 
MILLS (CONT) All pictures of Zero tied to the bed. (crouches) The last one's dated three days ago. 
Somerset looks at the first photo.  In it, Zero is bound and gagged, but he is fit, healthy. 
SOMERSET (awed) The first photo... it's dated one year ago.  Almost to the day. 
California lifts Zero's blanket to peek under, examining with morbid curiosity. 
CALIFORNIA Mo-ther... 
Mills kneels and lifts the bottom of the sheet off the floor, finds an open shoebox.  On the box: TO THE DETECTIVES. 
MILLS What's this? 
California leans close to Zero's gaunt, blindfolded face. 
CALIFORNIA You got what you deserved, Zero. 
Somerset leans down beside Mills.  Mills looks through the shoebox.  Inside are plastic, zip-lock bags.  One bag contains small clumps of hair, one contains a yellow liquid... 
MILLS A urine sample... hair sample... fingernail clippings.  He's laughing at us. 
California is still close to Zero's face when suddenly Zero's lips twist.  Zero lets out a loud, guttural bark.  California jerks back in fear, shouting, falling over a chair. 
Mills and Somerset reel, standing.  They see California on the ground, scared out of his mind, pointing. 
CALIFORNIA He's alive! 
Mills and Somerset look towards the bed. 
Zero's lips move feebly as he lets out a sick, gurgling moan. 
CALIFORNIA He's still alive! 
EXT.  SLUM TENEMENT BUILDING -- MORNING 
A crowd has gathered.  Mills' car, the police van and two ambulances are parked on the sidewalk. 
INT.  SLUM APARTMENT, HALLWAY -- MORNING 
The siege cops are in the hall, holding neighbors at bay. 
INT.  SLUM APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM -- MORNING 
Three ambulance attendants are at the bed, working on Zero.  One attendant uses wire-cutters to clip Zero's bonds. 
INT.  SLUM TENEMENT BUILDING, STAIRWELL -- MORNING 
Mills and Somerset stand in the middle of one flight of stairs. They are both highly agitated.

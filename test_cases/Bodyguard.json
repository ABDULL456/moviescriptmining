MARRON MANSION - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY                  28 \nFrank tours the house with Emma and Henry. Frank opens various doors, fidgets with locking mechanisms. Emma finds it all exciting. \n29   INT. MARRON ESTATE - POOL HOUSE/BALLET STUDIO - DAY        29 A small room at one end of the pool house has been fitted with a wall mirror and ballet exercise barre. A STEREO plays exercising MUSIC. Nicki, dressed in leotards, is doing pre-aerobic stretch- ing exercises. Frank appears outside the window. Nicki waves him in. Unseen by Frank, a huge St. Bernard lays in the front of the door. He muscles his way in, the dog never moves, just slides along the floor as Frank pushes the door open. Frank looks the room over. FRANK Unusual tactic for a guard dog, but effective. Nicki smiles, gesturing him in. NICKI You can look around if you like. Frank indicates it won't be necessary.   Nicki stops working out. FRANK I'm sorry to disturb you. NICKI That's all right. It's an excuse to rest. It's my private place. I'm the only one who works out around here. Frank glances at photos on one wall. Most are of Nicki from years ago; some show her performing with a band. \nNICKI My own ego wall. No platinum records. Frank spots a picture of two girls. \nFRANK You and Rachel? NICKI When I was a kid, I put a little band together. We played high school dances, stuff like that. Then Rachel joined the act. As you can imagine, she was quite a little entertainer. Even then, she had a way of stopping the show. So I kind of quit. Professionally, anyway. FRANK You never went back? NICKI It was pretty obvious who the star in our family was. Frank looks back at the picture.    Nicki smiles. \n30   EXT. MARRON ESTATE - GARAGE AREA - DAY                     30 Frank and Henry walk toward the closed garages. HENRY That depends on what you call a 'hint.' FRANK I don't want anyone on the street to be able to look at the cars and know who owns them. Henry leans in a doorway and hits a master switch. The three doors of the garage start to rise in sequence. HENRY I don't think there's anything here you'd call a 'hint.' One at a time the doors go up to reveal: First garage -- the Cadillac limousine we've seen earlier. License: RACHEL 2 Second garage -- a gray Mercedes.    License:   RACHEL 3 \nThird garage -- a Jaguar XKE in an outrageous pink. No other car in the world is this color. License: RACHEL 1 Frank looks at Henry, who is laughing and shakes his head. He walks toward the Jag. \nFrank releases the hood. He looks inside for a moment, then reaches into the guts of the engine. He fiddles for a second, then stands up holding some wires and slams the hood shut again. He gestures toward the other two cars. FRANK Get new plates for those two. \n31   EXT. GATE AREA - DAY                                       31 The fortification continues as workmen use a bulldozer to clear away the stonework around the entrance. \n32   EXT. DRIVEWAY OF MARRON ESTATE - DAY                       32 Sitting beside Henry, Frank teaches him how to spin the limo in a 180 degree 'skid turn,' sending up clouds of dust. A group of roadies watching bursts into spontan- eous applause. \n33   EXT. GATE AREA - DAY                                       33 Fletcher sits on the grass about halfway to the house, watching the activity with delighted interest. He turns as he spots something beyond the hedge. FLETCHER'S POV Workmen put up a seven-foot cyclone fence. Across the road, a black Toyota 4 X 4 is stopped. It slowly pulls away. We can't see inside it. \n", "test1_true": "35   INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - DAY                                35 Rachel, looking out her window at Fletcher and the work- men, sees the rock stop a yard from him. Fletcher scrambles away, much as a kid might dance back from a \nwave on a beach.   The sight disturbs Rachel. RACHEL Fletcher!    C'mon. Back in here! As she speaks, some workmen test the remote control on a window shutter. It descends in front of Rachel's face. She is not amused. Fletcher passes Frank on his way to join Rachel. He mutters almost under his breath. FLETCHER I think he's got a black 4 X 4. Could be a Chevy. More like a Toyota. Frank stares at Fletcher, then looks back to the street. \n36   INT. F.B.I. LOS ANGELES OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY     36 The room is dark. An opaque projector throws an image onto a screen; it is a letter threatening Rachel's life. We hear voices. One is Frank's; the other two belong to special agents RAY COURT and TERRY MINELLA. The letter is one of the pasted-up threats we saw being assembled earlier. It reads: MARRON BITCH -- YOU HAVE EVERYTHING I HAVE NOTHING. THE TIME IS COMING WHEN YOU SHALL DIE... Reading as fast as possible, we pick up some vicious threats and obscenities, but we don't have time to read it all before we... CUT TO: FRANK'S FACE illuminated by the screen. COURT (O.S.) This    is another of the ones we think    are worth pursuing. Lots of work    went into it. No prints. We're    doing lab work on it. It could    be nothing. MINELLA'S FACE is illuminated above the projector. MINELLA This is the one you think is tied to the doll? FRANK (O.S.) That's what her manager thinks. \nCOURT (O.S.) This 'I Have Nothing' business is a natural with the record and movie and all. The projector light goes off and the room light goes on. The room is practically bare. Ray Court, a prematurely white-haired, career civil servant, raises the window shade. Sunlight streams in. On Court's lapel is a tiny P.T. Boat pin. Terry Minella, a slight, dark 35-year-old, offers Frank a cigarette; Frank declines, Minella lights up. \nCOURT I sort of lost track of you after Washington. FRANK Yeah. COURT How's the private stuff? FRANK (noncommittal) Fine. COURT Big money, I bet? Huh? Frank shrugs.    Court looks at Minella knowingly. \n37   INT. FEDERAL BUILDING - DAY                                37 Minella and Court walk Frank to the lobby. COURT Shit. I knew it. It is big money. Fuck! You need an assistant? I'm ready to get out. I've lost my tolerance for assholic behavior. You should see the jerk we're covering now... COURT 'Hellfire Henry' Kent... MINELLA Shh!    Somebody wants to pop him... COURT Which isn't exactly surprising, considering what the shithead's \nbeen saying. MINELLA Yeah!  Do everyone a favor... (he coughs, ironically) As you know, we're nonpolitical these days. The three men laugh easily together.   They have reached the lobby doors. COURT (to Frank) We'll put this stuff through Washington. Behavioral Sciences should have something in a few days. FRANK Thanks. (a pause) Ray? COURT Yeah? FRANK Why am I getting all this cooperation? MINELLA She's a big star. Important people care about her. COURT Politics and show business are practically the same these days... Got any crowd photos we can use? FRANK I'm trying to keep her away from crowds. COURT Good luck. \n38   INT. THE IVY - DAY                                         38 It's busy. Lots of customers arriving, leaving and seated at tables. Waiters criss-cross the terrace. Near the entrance, Rachel is saying goodbye to a middle-aged WOMAN. Frank stands nearby with Nicki. The Woman says something to Rachel, who turns and looks at Frank. Rachel whispers something to the Woman and they both laugh. They kiss and Rachel moves toward the entrance. \nWOMAN (an afterthought; phony) Goodbye, Nicki. So great to see you. Nicki waves and follows Rachel. Frank stays very close without seeming to walk with Rachel. \nA little girl darts into their path and approaches Rachel. Rachel glances at Frank, who has stopped with her, then she signs an autograph for the girl. The girl's mother, close behind her, hands a small camera casually to Nicki to be photographed as she and her daughter pose with Rachel. Frank watches Nicki quietly comply. Rachel, Spector and Frank all reach the front entrance together, and Frank slips out first, glancing around. Rachel comes out and passes within inches of him. RACHEL I'm surprised you didn't plug them. \n39   EXT. THE IVY - DAY                                        39 Rachel attracts the usual stares from passersby. As they reach the limousine, Frank continues scanning the street. Tony stares at him, uncomprehending. TONY (impatiently) Hey, let's go. Frank takes a last look then gets into the front seat next to Tony. FRANK (across Tony) O.K. Henry, let's go. Tony looks at Frank, eyes narrowing. From across the street, we see the limo pull away. As the shot clears, the dark shape of another vehicle appears, slowly moving into frame over the top of the camera. \n40   INT. FRONT SEAT OF LIMO - DAY                             40 Frank sits beside Tony, next to the door.   Tony speaks to him in a near whisper. TONY Let me set you straight on a few things. For starters, I love this lady... What I do for her I do for \n", "test1_id": 1143, "test2_input": "Frank laughs. FRANK No... Nice try though. (pause) It was less dramatic than that. She didn't love me anymore. Can you imagine such a thing? \nFrank puts a smiling spin on this last; it's pretty charming. Rachel looks at him. RACHEL No, not really. A SONG comes on the JUKEBOX -- 'WHAT BECOMES OF THE BROKEN HEARTED.' Frank smiles as Rachel begins to sing. RACHEL So, is this a full service date, Frank? Frank's wary. RACHEL I'm just asking you to dance. \n87   INT. DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT                                 87 Frank and Rachel navigate a tiny dance floor. Frank is a surprisingly good dancer and is comfortable being this close to her. Rachel hums softly, picking up the words to the song.   As we listen to the lyrics something clicks in her head. RACHEL You like this? FRANK Yeah. A beat, then Rachel bursts out laughing. FRANK (reddening) What? \nRACHEL (trying to compose herself) I'm sorry... It's just that... It's so depressing. Now they're both laughing. \nFRANK (grinning) It is, isn't it. Suddenly a dish drops to the floor. Frank, still dancing, makes a smooth quick turn that puts his body between Rachel and the noise. His head turns to locate the source of the noise. \nRACHEL Don't worry, I'll protect you. They drift back into the music, Rachel singing, Frank watching. \n88   EXT. FRANK'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                  88 Frank's car is parked in the driveway.    A light goes on in a basement window. \n89   INT. FRANK'S HOUSE - BASEMENT                               89 Frank hangs back, drink in hand, as Rachel explores the basement. Frank has fitted it out as a combination gym/ target range/weapons workshop. The place has a kind of unfussy order about it, a simplicity. RACHEL (almost to herself) It's very quiet here. She walks to some shelves -- a random selection of books, football and karate trophies, framed citations and other memorabilia. She glances at a dusty framed photo of a football team. RACHEL (reading) West Virginia University Football. God, look at you. She looks at Frank, quizzically. RACHEL What'd you play? \nFRANK End. RACHEL Were you tough? FRANK No.    Fast. Rachel puts down her drink and moves toward a samurai sword that is mounted in its scabbard on the wall. She looks at it, peering closely. RACHEL You some kind of a samurai, too? \nFrank smiles. RACHEL They said you were in the Secret Service. What made you get out? Frank moves away and sits on a sofa against the wall. FRANK Money. Rachel looks around at Frank's modest home. RACHEL I can see your tastes are extravagant. She looks at Frank and then back at the sword.   She reaches out to touch it. RACHEL May I? Frank nods. Rachel takes it off its mount carefully, unhooks the scabbard and begins to slide it off. FRANK Watch yourself. Rachel slides the scabbard off. The naked blade is breathtaking. Rachel holds the sword out before her. She walks toward Frank, then stops and looks over the blade at him. RACHEL You're a hard one to figure, Frank Farmer. He stares at her. She steps closer, so the blade is only about a foot from his face. \nRACHEL It seems to me a bodyguard must know little peace. Frank stands up so that the point of the sword is only about an inch from his chest. He reaches out over the blade to Rachel's neck and unties the silk scarf she is wearing there. One hand draws the scarf away. The other hand lingers for a moment on her neck, then lifts away. FRANK Watch this. He has raised the scarf over his head, in   the space between them. With two hands he spreads    it out and then lets it go. Slowly, billowing, the scarf    floats down over the blade and is cut in two. These    two pieces float slowly to the floor. Frank takes Rachel's wrist and moves the sword away to the side. They are both holding it as Rachel presses her body against Frank's and they begin to kiss. \n90   INT. FRANK'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT                        90 Their lovemaking is INTERCUT with SLOW MOTION black and white images of Samurai warriors from the movie, Yojimbo. \n", "test2_true": "is still in the bed behind him, woken by the noise of his activity. RACHEL What? What is it? What are you doing? \nFrank keeps moving, looking for his shoes. RACHEL Frank? FRANK Rachel, I don't want to get confused about what I'm doing here. \nRACHEL I'm not confused. Frank finds his shoes. FRANK You pay me to protect you, that's what I do. Rachel sits up. RACHEL What? Have I done something wrong? FRANK No, nothing. RACHEL Then what is it? She lifts the sheet seductively and looks over the top of it. RACHEL Do you want me to beg? FRANK No, I want you to do without. She stops. RACHEL What's going on, Frank? FRANK I want to keep it straight in my head what job I'm doing. \nRACHEL And what is that exactly?    Making me feel like shit? FRANK No, I'm sorry. This is my fault. \nRACHEL Don't apologize for godsake. Just tell me what I did. I'm a big girl. FRANK You didn't do anything. It was me. I involved myself with my client. \nRachel picks up on the word. RACHEL Your \"client\"? FRANK I made a mistake. RACHEL What mistake?... You don't find me attractive anymore. FRANK Christ! I've told you why. I can't protect you like this. RACHEL And what?   That's it for me? FRANK Yeah... RACHEL I don't believe it. He automatically checks the gun as he slips it into the holster. FRANK You can live with that or you can fire me. RACHEL But I can't fuck you. Frank turns and looks at her.    This is hard for him, too. RACHEL I don't believe this... I'm asking you?... Let me tell you... \nShe stops suddenly and, with a roar of combined frus- tration, humiliation and rage, she lurches from the bed in search of her clothes. Frank shuts his eyes in morti- fication and pain. \n93   EXT. MARRON ESTATE - POOLSIDE - EARLY MORNING              93 A nanny sits in the early morning mist, embroidering. Frank is kneeling with Fletcher beside the pool. He's putting new batteries into Fletcher's boat. Fletcher watches him as he tears off the wrapping from the batteries, much preoccupied. FLETCHER (watching him) She's real mad at you, isn't she? Frank stops what he's doing and just looks blankly at the batteries in his hands. There's a beat of silence. FLETCHER She told me she doesn't understand why you're so shitty to her... Frank's shoulders droop and he lets out an imperceptible sigh. He gently resumes fitting the batteries, still not looking at Fletcher. In the quiet of early morning, it's almost like a confessional. FRANK I've spent a lot of time learning not to react to things like other people do. It's my job. But it doesn't always work, Fletcher... it doesn't always work. FLETCHER I don't think I understand. FRANK (looks at him) I'm an old man compared to you, pal, and I don't understand either. And I'm starting to get the feeling I never will. There's a crunch of footsteps behind him.       He looks around. With a big flourish, a copy of Daily Variety is put down in front of us, front page upwards. NICKI (O.S.) Ta Da! \nFrank takes in that it's Nicki then glances at Variety, lying on the concrete beside him. Splashed across the top, the headlines announce the day's news of the Academy Award nominations. Rachel's name is among the Best Actress nominees. The Hollywood Reporter follows. Frank picks up Variety and stares at it. Nicki stands beside him with the morning's mail under her arm. \nNICKI (looking at him) Thought you'd like to know. Everyone said she was a sure thing. Of course, you know all about that. She raises an eyebrow, gives him a look. Frank looks steadily back at her. She drops a small pile of mail beside the magazines... several letters and a small packet. She's embarrassed by Frank's gaze. NICKI I'm sorry. That was out of line. It's none of my business... Here's today's question marks for you. She turns and walks briskly back to the house. Frank watches her go, then looks slowly down to the pile. From across the pool, Fletcher watches silently, then pushes his boat out into the deep water. \n94   INT. SQUIRREL HILL PRODUCTIONS - JANITOR'S ROOM - DAY     94 Frank is investigating the small packet, with a surgeon's precision, checking it with a stethoscope and a metal detector, sniffing at it. It has been addressed in the normal way, except that Rachel's name has been cut out of a magazine and pasted above the address. He begins carefully slicing away the wrapping. Inside is a cardboard box. The contents are still hidden by packing paper. He picks it away with tweezers. Suddenly there is a LOUD BUZZING from the box and movement in the paper. Frank drops the box into a bed of sand in a sink surrounded by sandbags. The movement slows and stops. Frank extracts the item -- it is a wind-up mechanical beaver with a hand-painted sign hung around its neck: WE LOVE YOU, RACHEL YOUR FANS IN BEAVER, PA. SALLY AND KATE. The beaver's TEETH CLICK in Frank's hand. We see Frank's face. This may just have taken years off his life. He holds his hand out straight, palm downwards, \nand looks at it.   No tremor.   Just checking. Spector's voice suddenly shouts from the next door office. SPECTOR (O.S.) Farmer!   Get in here! \n", "test2_id": 1144, "test3_input": "186   INT. STAIRWAY - NIGHT                                    186 Frank begins climbing the stairs. When he has gone a quarter of the way up, Rachel appears at the top and begins walking down. \nAt first she doesn't see Frank; when she does she hesitates a moment, then continues down. They meet and try to sidestep each other, but twice they go in the same direction, unable to get around. Rachel, already emotionally ravaged, cracks. She begins slapping Frank hard about the face and torso. One of the first blows knocks the GLASS from his hand; it SMASHES loudly against the wall. He raises his arms in a half-hearted attempt to protect himself from the onslaught. She cries as she hits him. RACHEL (hysterical) You, you, you... You brought this pain into my house... Now you're here! Where were you then? Why didn't you save her? It was your job to protect me and she died doing it... It was me they were after. And you let them kill her! (she gasps for air) She never did anything to anyone. As she loses the strength and the will to hit him, her blows become sloppy, weak. She sinks to the steps, sitting on them, sobbing. RACHEL She never hurt anyone. She was good. (she looks at him; entreats him) You saw her. She never wished anyone any harm. Did she? Did she? Frank looks at her, shakes his head \"no.\" Rachel puts her head in her hands and is silent for a few moments; her crying slows. RACHEL (finally, quietly) She never hurt a soul. (long pause) ... I didn't love her well enough. I didn't take care of her... (a beat) ... She gave me only love. \nShe sits quietly on the steps in the gloom. Frank watches for a long moment, then softly continues on his way. \n186A   EXT. POOL AREA - MARRON ESTATE - DAY                      186A It's bright sunshine. Fletcher is splashing noisily in the pool with a few other kids. His nanny waits patiently at the side, towels at the ready. At one side of the pool, Rachel sits, lost in thought, mourning her sister. At the other side sits Frank, also thoughtful. He, too, is trying to adjust to the tragedy for which he bears some of the responsibility. \nThe SHOUTS and LAUGHTER of the kids continue. \n187    EXT. MARRON ESTATE - GROUNDS - LATER THAT NIGHT           187 The guardhouse at the main gate is brilliantly illumi- nated in the distance. The guard patrols at his station. Inside, the T.V. screens flicker and glow. Perched on the top of a slight   hill, Frank sits alone and motionless under a big tree.    He gazes down at the gate- house, his face lit softly by   the glow from its lamps. All around him the rest of the   estate is quiet and tranquil in the moonlight. After a moment, another silhouetted figure slowly ap- proaches and stands beside him. It's Rachel. RACHEL I guess you've heard what's happening. Frank nods. RACHEL Mind if I sit down? Frank shakes his head. They sit side by side for awhile, both lost in thought. Rachel seems very calm. RACHEL It isn't over yet, is it? Frank shakes his head. FRANK He knows he still hasn't got you. RACHEL So he'll come again? \nFRANK It's possible. RACHEL The Oscars? \nFRANK Maybe. Rachel takes this philosophically.     She tugs at the grass, thinking. RACHEL When I was back in Squirrel Hill, I started betting my friends fifty bucks each that someday I'd win an Oscar. You can understand how important it is that they see me up there if I win. She looks at him and smiles. RACHEL If everyone of those pikers comes through, it could add up to a lot of money. FRANK I think it's very dangerous. RACHEL I know. But I can't stay up here on my hill forever. They are silent for awhile.     Rachel lies back on the grass, stares at the sky. RACHEL I didn't get to this place in my life by doing the smart thing every time. (as Frank nods) How 'bout you, Frank Farmer? Out there on the edge... did you ever do something that didn't make too much sense, except maybe inside you? In your stomach somewhere? Something that wasn't smart? (looks at him) I'll bet you have plenty. I'll bet you do. Nobody gets really good without it. And you're good. I know that. She sits up beside him. \nRACHEL I don't know why all this has happened to me... (a beat) ... but I do know that none of it's your fault. I hope you can hear me, because this is how I say I'm sorry. Frank accepts. RACHEL (relieved) So... I'm going to go see if I win an Oscar. And I won't worry about it at all. Because I've got you to protect me. Frank almost smiles. FRANK That's right. He looks at her a long time, then takes her in his arms. He kisses her and lays her down. His body moves over hers. Like a bodyguard, protecting her from the night. \n188   EXT. THE PANTAGES THEATRE - NIGHT                           188 The chaos and razamatazz of Oscar night.   Crowds, limos, cameras, searchlights... \n189   INT. RACHEL'S LIMO - FRONT OF THE PANTAGES - NIGHT          189 The limo is waiting in a line of limos to reach the red- carpeted entrance to The Pantages Theatre. Frank and Tony sit in front with Henry. In the back a spectacularly-gowned Rachel sits flanked by Devaney and Spector, both of whom, like Frank, are wearing tuxedos.     Up ahead, they can all see the hubbub at the entrance: TV cameras, lights, photographers, arriving guests, two bleachers full of fans. The glare from the arc lights is almost blinding. DEVANEY We'll go straight back to the Green Room. Right, Frank? Frank nods. DEVANEY Got that, Tony? \nFRANK Tony knows what he's doing. Tony looks at Frank, surprised and not a little pleased with the unexpected support. \n", "test3_true": "RACHEL Jesus, what a crew. Rachel leans forward and flips down the mirror on the panel in front of her and checks her appearance. The limo moves up. RACHEL Screw it. I'm through worrying. When your number's up, it's up. Right, Farmer? The limo is almost at the red carpet.   Frank slips out the front door of the moving limo. \n190   EXT. LIMO - NIGHT                                         190 More quartz lights click on. The TV cameras all focus on the door of the limo as Frank steps out of the way. FRANK'S POV as he surveys the busy scene. A microphoned M.C. peers into Rachel's limo and walks toward it. M.C. ... Miss Rachel Marron! ON TV CAMERA MONITOR we see Rachel wave to the crowd. M.C. Everyone wishes you the best tonight, Rachel. Frank leads the small procession down the red carpet. Fans reach out asking for his autograph. FRANK'S POV \nas his glance darts around: high into the bleachers, ahead in the distance, to the door, to the side at photographers nodding to the massed security men with their walkie-talkies. Rachel's smile is convincing, lovely, professional. Spector, Devaney and Tony look strained. As they enter, a WIDE SHOT from across the street shows their limo pulling ahead as the next car pulls up. The CAMERA TRACKS SIDEWAYS to reveal the rear fender of a Toyota 4X4 parked in the foreground. \n191   INT. GREEN ROOM - NIGHT                                      191 \nIt is large and has been fitted with a bar and buffet. Formally-dressed presenters and hosts mill about, laugh- ing and talking. Many greet Rachel. A TV monitor hangs from the ceiling in one corner. On it, the Academy Awards continue. An elaborate dance number is just concluding. The audience applauds. Beside the monitor, a large clock with a ticking second hand. A harried associate producer SKIP THOMAS, comes up to Rachel, settled in an armchair. Tony stands nearby, Frank leans against a far wall. SKIP Hello, Rachel. I need to get you straight on your responsibilities. RACHEL Sure, Skip. Skip takes a typewritten sheet from a sheaf in his hand and gives it to Rachel. He consults a clipboard as he speaks. There, laid out minute by minute, is the order of the evening's events. Each one has a precise time printed beside it, including those that involve Rachel. SKIP Now, it's Best Sound, then another song, then you. At precisely (looks at his clipboard) -- 8:07, you'll be presenting with Clive Healy. Those are your lines. The prompter's straight ahead and -- we pray -- working perfectly. Rachel nods. RACHEL \nFine, you'll be a big shot someday, Skip. Skip smiles and walks off, glancing up at the clock. 7:43. CLIVE HEALY, a slim British actor appears, bows and kisses Rachel's hand. \nCLIVE I understand it's my great honor to escort you onstage. RACHEL That's right, Clive. And I don't like it one bit that you look skinnier than me. \nTV MONITOR - The show is progressing, flashing out across the world. PATRICIA ... And the award for Best Achievement in Sound goes to Kay Colvin and Mychal Smith for Hot And Cold. Applause. KAY Thank you so much. I want to thank our producers, Karen Golden and Ed Gorsuch, as well our sound crew -- Richard Goodman and Blair Forward. I'm too excited -- but they're the real winners tonight. Thank you! MICHAEL This is wonderful. This is like, the happiest moment of my life.

Rachel is deep in a giggling, girlish conversation with another actress. Skip Thomas approaches Rachel again. SKIP \nRachel.    One more song, then you. Rachel nods, goes back to her conversation.       Frank steps up to Tony. FRANK I'm going to have a look around. I'll come back for her. Stay alert. Tony nods, watches Frank go. \n193   INT. BACKSTAGE AREA - NIGHT                                     193 Frank moves down the hall from the Green Room toward the stage. Stagehands, technicians, performers speak in hushed tones. TV monitors are mounted throughout the area. On screen a distinguished-looking actor named REARDON is serving as temporary master of ceremonies. Frank walks along, checking the route, looking up into the flies. He rounds a corner and is face to face with Portman. FRANK Portman.   What are you doing here? PORTMAN I'm on the job. FRANK Who?

Neo squints into the sun that seems unnaturally bright. He is the only one without sunglasses. 
MORPHEUS Do you now understand what it means when we say, if you're not one of us, you're one of them? 
NEO The agents.  They're sentient programs.  They can commandeer any software hardwired to the mainframe. 
MORPHEUS Anyone that is still in a power plant.  That is why we try to be invisible in the Matrix. 
NEO The best hacking is always traceless. 
Cypher and Trinity move away from them, securing the perimeter.  As Cypher passes a garbage can, he surreptitiously drops something inside. 
It is a cellular phone and we watch the blue display as the LINE CONNECTS. 
An early 1970s, black Lincoln Continental emerges from a corrugated roll-up garage.  Morpheus and Neo get in. 
INT.  LINCOLN CONTINENTAL (MATRIX) - DAY 
An enormous man is waiting for them.  A wad of chewing tobacco bulges his cheek.  He spits into a Coke can. 
MOJO Morpheus, been a long time coming. 
MORPHEUS You're looking well, Mojo. 
Mojo coughs a brown, cankerous laugh, juice speckling his chin and shirt.  He stares at Neo. 
MOJO You bringing us geriatrics now. Morpheus? 
He spits and laughs again. 
MOJO Guess you are locking for a miracle. 
EXT.  BAR (MATRIX) - DAY 
The Continental pulls up to a bar in the kind of neighborhood where every corner has a pair of eyes. 
INT.  BAR (MATRIX) - DAY 
A lightless, lower-class bar.  No one enters that is not expected. 
The front doors open in a brilliant burst of sunlight as Mojo leads Morpheus and Neo inside.  Neo looks around, his eyes adjusting to the darkness. 
Mojo talks to the bartender, then looks over. 
MOJO All right, it's cool.  Go on back. 
They weave their way to the back of the bar, the STICKY FLOOR SNAPPING under their FEET. 
A monolith of a man rises from his stool as they walk up. 
REX You're late. 
He moves to the side, opening the heavy iron door behind him.  They descend the basement staircase toward the single bare bulb at the bottom, hanging above the only door. 
INT.  BASEMENT (MATRIX) - DAY 
A high-tech laptop and modem are set up on a stack of milk crates.  Neo waits as Morpheus types in a series of access codes.  After a moment the screen blinks, "Welcome Morpheus." 
Morpheus walks back to the same door they entered, but it now leads into -- 
INT.  TEMPLE OF ZION (MATRIX) - DAY 
The walls and floors are polished marble.  Neo follows, his mouth agape. 
NEO What -- what happened? 
MORPHEUS This is the temple.  It is a part of Zion's mainframe.  It's hidden inside the Matrix so that we can access it. 
Two PRIESTESSES are waiting in the antechamber. 
PRIESTESS Hello, Morpheus.  We've been expecting you. 
MORPHEUS Okay, you're on your own.  Go with them. 
They take Neo by the arm, leading him down a hall into another room. 
PRIESTESS Wait here.  Among the other Potentials. 
INT.  ROOM OF POTENTIALS (MATRIX) - DAY 
Neo enters and finally understands the attention given to his age.  The Potentials are all little children. 
The room feels at once like a Buddhist temple and a kindergarten class.  The children's heads are either shaved or thick with dreadlocks.  Some are playing, others meditating or practicing their gift. 
Neo watches a little girl levitate wooden alphabet blocks.  A skinny BOY holds a SPOON which sways like a blade of grass as he bends it with his rnind. 
Neo crosses to him, sits. 
The Boy smiles as Neo picks up a spoon and tries to imitate him.  Despite his best efforts, Neo cannot make it bend. 
SPOON BOY Your spoon does not bend because it is just that, a spoon.  Mine bends because there is no spoon, just my mind. 
Neo watches as it curls into a knot. 
SPOON BOY Link yourself to the spoon. Become the spoon and bend yourself. 
Neo nods, again holding up his spoon. 
NEO There is no spoon.  Right. 
He concentrates.  The spoon begins to bend just as the Priestess touches his shoulder. 
PRIESTESS The Oracle will see you now.

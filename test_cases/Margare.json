(Pause) Could you see if it was red? Green? Yellow? Just picture it in your mind. What color was the light? Lisa looks over at the Bus Driver. He looks back at her. \nLISA I guess it was green? I didn't really see it. I think it was just an accident. \nBehind the Bus Driver somebody moves from where they were, and Lisa gets a clear view of the woman's covered body. \n17A TIME PERMITTING 17A \n17B EXT.

She starts to take off her blood-soaked jacket, but her purse is over her shoulder. She drops the purse and takes off the jacket. \n19 CONTINUED: 19 She doesn't know what to do with it. She hangs it on the closet door. She sits on the bed and then gets up and looks at where she sat. There's an imprint of blood on the white bedspread. \nLISA Good one, Lisa.

Her hair and body are still matted and streaked with blood. Joan is picking up the bloody clothes and boots. \nJOAN I don't know if I'm going to be able to get these clean again. \nLISA Just throw them out. \n21 CONTINUED: 21 \nJOAN Let me see if I can get them clean. \nLISA \n(STARTS CRYING) Whv?

And I think it's still in previews...? \nJOAN Yeah, we're on kind of a weird schedule... \nRAMON I think you will have a big success. \nJOAN Well, at the moment we're just trying to focus on what we're doing... \nRAMON I don't know if you are busy, but will you allow me to -buy you a drink? There's a place right down the street... If you like to ask your friends... or if you didn't eat dinner... Joan sees Lisa sitting across the room waiting. \nJOAN Oh -- No -- thank you. I can't.

He sent me flowers. \nLISA Go out with him. \nJOAN You think? \nLISA Um, yeah...! Ramon disappears up the stairs. Joan and Lisa look at each other. \nJOAN Hi, sweetie... ! \nLISA She kisses and hugs Lisa, squashing her a little. Lisa gets a little tearful. Joan squeezes her tighter. \n31 INT. THEATER BAR/RESTAURANT. NIGHT. 31 \nLisa is out with Joan and some of the other actors from the show.

Joan, in a bathrobe, kisses her goodbye. \nLISA 'Bye Mom. \n32 CONTINUED: 32 \nJOAN I love you. \nLISA I love you too. Lisa goes out. We stay with Joan, who looks fretful. \n33 EXT. BROADWAY.

Because the executor of the estate Cdn bring a Wrongful Death suit, but the beneficiary has to be a relative. So let me explain about that. In a Wrongful Death suit you can sue for Pain and Suffering, Pecuniary Losses, Lose of Support or Services.. .And also what's called Care, Comfort and Society: --like advice, counseling of the parent that the kids aren't gonna get anymore... \nLISA You can really sue for that? \nDAVE Yeah, and that's probably what we would do, \nLISA So -- I don't understand. Who are we suing? The bus driver? \nDAVE Well, no, because the bus driver wouldn't have any money. You basically sue everybody and hope something sticks. The person who pays will be the MTA's insurance company. \nLISA But do you think the driver would get fired? \nPink Revised 9/25/05 - Page 109A \n128 CONTINUED: (2) 128 \nDAVE No. Not necessarily. \n128 CONTINUED: (3) 128 \nLISA Even if all the facts came out at the trial? \nDAVE Maybe. I don't know. \nEMILY But how much could they be liable for? \nDAVE EMILY It depends: How badly do you think we could ever hurt them? \nDAVE -- if she was alive, in great pain for an extended period of time, they give more money for that. \nLISA I'd say she was alive for ten minutes. \nDAVE And I gather in a lot .of pain? \nLISA Her leg was cut off. \nDAVE Yes -- obviously. And -- but was she conscious? Awake, the whole time? \nLISA I'm sorry, Emily. (To DAVE) Yeah, awake. \nEMILY That's OK. \nDAVE Well, if she was in a lot of pain for that long ...I don't know. . .maybe 300,000 or a half a million dollars to get a sustainable verdict? A brain damaged baby would be\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 three million. But the truth is, Lisa, after all's said and done, it's not a very good case. \nLISA Why not? \nDAVE Because it's your word against his, and because you already lied on your first deposition. A red light case is a fifty- fifty proposition already. And with only one eyewitness, with two conflicting statements? I wouldn't take-that case. \nPink Revised 9/25/05 - Page 111 \n128 CONTINUED: (4) 128 \nEMILY Nobody really cares about getting a lot of money here. \nDAVE I understand that -- \nEMILY We just want this prick to Buffer. and we want the bus company to take resonsibility for hiring this guy. \nDAVE I understand. But no matter how you slice it, the fact that Lisa lied on her first statement is a disaster for your lawyer. \nLISA Can't I explain why I lied the first time? It's not like I'm trying to get any money for myself. \nDAVE That's true-Since she have no financial interest she can't be impeached for bias. \nEMILY Impeached for what? \nDAVE She can't have her credibility attacked on financial grounds because the jury knows you're not getting any money if you win. \nLISA So that's'something, isn't it? \nEMILY But do you really think we know what that means? \nDAVE I'm sorry. That's what its called. \nEMILY But who are you talking to? You know we don't know what that means. It's like you're not really concentrating. \nDAVE I -- don't know. I am concentrating.

So they're not gonna want a lot of publicity. \nLISA Anyway, the whole point is to get this guy -- \nEMILY Is to fucking get this guyl \nLISA No, its to get him out from behind the wheel of a bus! \nDAVE Did she know she was dying? I only ask because the terror of knowing you're dying raises the damages. \nLISA I think she had a pretty good idea. \nDAVE If she had lived for a couple of days it would make the case better...I know this sounds horrible, but this is what it comes down to... \nEMILY I know. We know, Dave. That's OK. Silence. Emily starts to speak: \nDAVE I actually did have one more thought...I do know one guy who's, uh... You know what?

You said you might re-interview the bus driver... \nMITCHELL \nYes, we did:.We brought him back in -- \n", "test2_true": "MITCHELL Well, he basically stuck to his original representation, and that was pretty much it. I brought it up with my sergeant, but he agrees with me we still don't have enough to charge this guy, so there's really not a lot more we can do at this point. \nLISA But how did you ask the questions? \nMITCHELL Excuse me? \nLISA He's obviously not gonna change his \nstatement if you just ask him like really politely: Why would he? We already know he's a liar. \nMITCHELL Hey, you know, Lisa, in the old days we'd just throw him in the back with a rubber hose and we'd get whatever answer we want out of him. But fortunately we don't do that kind of thing anymore -- \nLISA Yeah, not to white people. \nMITCHELL Excuse me? \n130 CONTINUED: (2) 130 \nLISA You don't do it to white people. Anyway, I'm not saying you -- \nMITCHELL We don't do it to who? \nLISA Oh my God... \nMITCHELL First of all, I don't know why you're bringin' the guy's race into it. There's forty thousand cops in this city -- \nLISA Yes, thank you, yes. \nMITCHELL -- and I hate to disillusion you, but most of 'em are pretty good guys, just tryin' to do their job.

(over the phone, flat) There's nothin' to appeal. There's no case. \nLISA But how do you know Detective Mitchell interrogated him aggressively enough if you weren't there? \nJOAN What's going on?

Joan is smoking. \n132 CONTINUED: 132 \nJOAN -- so funny: it's the same show, but now they all read how great it is, we get these big standing ovations every night, and it's the exact same show as before. \nRAMON But why do you put yourself down? It's a wonderful show and a wonderful performance. \nJOAN No, it's not -- I'm not putting myself down. It's just that the audience always reacts differently if they've been told it's good. A lot of actors have that experience. \nRAMON Mm hm? She takes a few steps away. \nJOAN I love this view...(Pause) You know, Ramon...this may sound very stupid to you, but do you ever worry that we don't have very much in common? \nRAMON What do you mean? \nJOAN Well, I don't mean to sound dissatisfied, or disgruntled. But I feel like we're always misunderstanding each other. Do you feel that way at all? Or am I just completely off the beam? \nRAMON I don't think we should talk about that, Joan. \nJOAN You don't? Well...I think it's kind of important or I wouldn't have brought it up. \nRAMON Joan... I like you very much. But let's not talk about what you are like, and what I am like. That never makes a good result. Talk about it with your friends. \nJOAN My friends...! \nRAMON Yes. \n2nd Pink Revised 11/17/05 - Page 116 \n132 CONTINUED: (2) 132 He sips his drink.

NIGHT. 132A \nRamon and Joan are in his modernistic, scrupulously clean carpeted living room, on the sofa, looking at pictures. \nRAMON That's a little place we used to go on holiday, two hours outside of Cartagena...My family is all there still, but Rodrigo is studying in London, and Hector is in Geneva. \nJOAN Uh huh... \nRAMON I'm sure they will go back eventually, because they like to do something for their country. But it's a worry, because it's very bad there now. \nJOAN Yeah...I haven't really been following it. \nRAMON It's a big, big mess. Last year I helped to found an organization to work with children whose families have been killed, or the parents have been kidnapped, so they don't know if they are alive or dead. We try to find homes for them, preferably in Colombia, because if we lose our young people, that's it: That's the future. We have raised a lot of money, but there's only so much we can do. You don't like to say it's hopeless, but it's hard to see the solution. \nJOAN Yeah. God...I wish I knew more about it...Do you mind if I ask you something? \nRAMON Of course not. \nJOAN Why are you interested in me? \n2nd Pink Revised 11/17/05 - Page 116A \n132A CONTINUED: 132A \nRAMON You don't think I should be? \nJOAN I just feel kind of ignorant about your whole world... \nRAMON You think it would be better if we knew about all the same things? \nJOAN Not really, not exclusively. It's just unusual. Don't you think it's unusual? \n2nd Pink Revised 11/17/05 - Page 117 \n132A CONTINUED: (2) 132A \nRAMON Not for me. \nJOAN I guess you travel a lot. I've only been out of the country a few times in my whole life. \nRAMON You should travel more. \nJOAN I know. I've always wanted to. It's hard when you're in the theater... \nRAMON Still, you should try. It's a big world. You're an artist. You should see more of it. \nJOAN I know. You don't have to keep saying that. I've always wanted to travel. It's just a little difficult with two kids and no husband, but it's hard to make a lot of money in the theater. I was on a TV show a few years back and I socked away some money because of that, but my ex-husband -- \nRAMON Karl. \nJOAN Karl, yes, you remembered, very good. Karl's very generous with the kids when he can be, but he's struggling too: He's a director: he directs commercials, and now he's trying to produce them... Anyway, I'm not ignorant because I enjoy it. \nRAMON I don't say you're ignorant... Do you think Lisa will be interested in acting? \nJOAN I don't think so. I think's she's got a lot of contempt for it. Of course that may be the age. \nRAMON She would prefer the world with no plays? No films? \n", "test2_id": 862, "test3_input": "150 CONTINUED: 150 \nLISA Well...? How's that anti-Semitic piece of shit Ramon?- \nJOAN Oh God, I don't know. The PHONE RINGS.

I'm really looking forward to our horseback riding trip... \nKARL Yeah. That's why I'm calling. I don't think it's going to happen. \nLISA Really? What's the matter? \nKARL Nothing's the matter. Nobody seems to really want to go, and I don't really feel like spending three thousand bucks on something nobody has the slightest interest in. So I think it's obviously better for everyone if we just cancel. \nLISA I never said I didn't want to go. \nKARL Well, I can't seem to get a straight answer about what anybody wants to eat, um, Annette is giving me a hard time about her schedule, I talk to Curtis and all I get are monosyllables, so -- \nLISA I think-he's really looking forward to it -- \nKARL Uh huh? Well, you know, that hasn't really been my impression. So, uh...I also think it would be good to shelve the idea of your coming out here next year. \n(MORE) \n151 CONTINUED: 151 \nKARL (CONT'D) It looks like things are gonna start picking up for me in the Fall, which means I'm probably not gonna be around the house all that much, and since you and Annette detest each other, I don't, uh, I don't think that's what I want to come home to after a fourteen hour day. \nLISA We don't detest each other \nKARL OK, well, it doesn't really strike me as something you're that serious about anyway, so what do you say we just table it for the time being? \nLISA \nOK. \nKARL OK. So tell Curtis, uh, that New Mexico's off...Ummm, and I will talk to you, ummm, whenever. \nLISA \nOK... \nKARL Yeah. He hangs up. LISA hangs up too. \nJOAN What's wrong? \nLISA Dad's cancelling the trip. \nJOAN What? Why? \nLISA He's says nobody wants to go and he doesn't want to spend the money. \nJOAN Did you say you didn't want to go? \nLISA No, I know there was some problem with Annette about arranging for food because I don't eat dead animals, but.I didn't think it was.going to wreck the whole trip. \nJOAN Oh boy. \n151 CONTINUED: (2) 151 \nLISA I thought you said it sounded like it was going to be a disaster. Personally I'm relieved. I'm not moving out there, either, by the way, obviously. Which is fine too. \n152 INT. KARL'S HOUSE. DAY. 152 \nKarl sits holding the phone in a savage depression. \n153 INT. MR AARON'S APARTMENT. DAY. 153 \nLisa sits on a sofa. She takes a sip of coffee. \nLISA Thank you for letting me come up. I don't know who else to talk to. She's talking to MR AARON, who looks very uncomfortable. \nMR AARON That's all right... \nLISA You've always been very sympathetic to my craziness, and I may not show it all the time, but I actually really appreciate it. \nMR AARON It's no problem, Lisa. What's been going on? \nLISA I just need to talk to somebody who doesn't completely misunderstand who Iam. Or not even who I am, but what's going on inside me, or all around me. Sound confused enough? Anyway, for whatever reason, I always felt like we understood each other on some level, even though I'm like a mass of conflicting impulses and you're basically the most grown-up, rational man I know. \nMR AARON Well...I doubt that's actually true but thank you... \nLISA You seem pretty fuckin' rational to me. Like that seems to be your leading feature. I mean you obviously have a lot of pretty deep feelings...So when you're rational - just to finish my thought -- it's like this really interesting way of governing yourself. \n(MORE) \n153 CONTINUED: 153 \nLISA (CONT'D) And you don't have to get all uncomfortable again: I'm not talking about what you think I'm talking about, because I know that subject is-off-limits. I'm talking about your soul, I guess, and how you feel you have to keep it in check all the time by being sensible. Do you know what I'm saying at all? \nMR AARON Well...We all have feelings, Lisa. I happen to believe that who you are comes out of how you deal with those feelings. Somebody makes you mad, you don't just pick up a gun and shoot them...Or if you do, that says something about who you are, and how you've been raised... \nLISA Well, I don't want to disillusion you, but we happen to be living in a world where that is what people do. More often than not. \nMR AARON That's not true, Lisa. I think it's very sad that you see it that way. There's eight billion people alive in the world and you think they don't all want to kill someone once in a while? But they don't. Most of them. Or they see some person they -- (Pause) I think most people do try to be civilized by some standard. Even if it's a standard you and I might not agree with... \nLISA No, I get it. That's actually the most hopeful thing anybody's said to me for a long time. I don't know why I take such a dire view of things, I really don't. She removes her jacket. She's wearing a small clingy T-shirt. \nLISA (CONT'D) Just a little hot...A little warm .Is this all right? \nMR AARON Sure. \nLISA Do you allow smoking in your apartment? \nMR AARON You can smoke. She gets her cigarettes out and lights one. He gets up and brings her an ashtray. They meet at the sofa and sit. \n153 CONTINUED: (2) 153 \nLISA I like your apartment. \nMR AARON Thank you. She blows some smoke out and waves it away. \nLISA Sorry. \nMR AARON That's all right. \nLISA This is terrible. \nMR AARON What is? What's terrible? \nLISA I just like you so much...(Smooths her ash on the ashtray.) Sorry. What a moron. \nMR AARON (taking her hand) Hey. Lisa. I'm your friend. And that's not gonna change. That's not gonna change. \nLISA Thanks. Thank you. She kisses his hand a couple of times. \nMR AARON Lisa... \nLISA Please just let me for a second. I like you so much. I like you so, so much. She kisses his hand more elaborately. He lets this go on. She lifts her head up and they kiss for real.

It's OK. \nMR AARON Are you all right? \nLISA Yes, yes, you don't have to keep asking me that. \nMR AARON I think we should stop. \nLISA No, keep going...! She keeps pushing against him. \n155 INT. MR AARON'S APARTMENT. LATER. 155 \nAT THE DOOR. She is leaving. He is burning with guilt and shame. Silence.

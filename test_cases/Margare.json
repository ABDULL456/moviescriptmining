{"train": "MARGARET \nWritten by \nKenneth Lonergan \nNovember 20, 2005 \n1 EXT. MANHATTAN. BROADWAY. UPPER 70S. DAY. 1 \nFrom across Broadway we see a little girl waiting at the curb. She steps off the curb toward us -- A TRUCK BARRELS into frame -- The long lens' flattened perspective makes it look like she's just been crushed. But the truck flashes by and she's fine. More traffic passes to and fro through the frame. \nCREDITS BEGIN OVER: \n2 EXT. ANOTHER CORNER. DAY. 2 \nThe LIGHT CHANGES and a crowded corner full of New Yorkers step off the curb and into the crosswalk -- Before the first foot lands on the street we go to SUPER SLOW MOTION as the mid-day work crowd crosses the street. \n3 EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREETS. DAY. 3 \nMONTAGE -- Slow motion shots of New Yorkers, mid-day, all kinds, going all different ways, all over the city. CREDITS END with some high school kids with book bags, walking among the crowds. \n4 INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM. DAY. 4 \nAn 11th-grade math class at the Ralph Waldo Emerson School, one of the few remaining Manhattan '60s-inspired progressive schools. About twenty kids, mostly white secular Jewish. A sprinkling of black and Hispanic kids. The teacher, MR AARON, late 20s, is returning test papers. \nMR AARON Abrams... Allende... One after the other the students get up to collect their tests, glance at the results and drag themselves back to their chairs. On LISA COHEN, just 17. Not the best-looking girl in her class but definitely in the top five. She listens listlessly, somewhat bad-temperedly. \nMR AARON (CONT'D) Bernstein... Cohen... At \"Cohen\" LISA gets up and heads for the desk. LISA'S POV, closing in slowly on MR AARON who glances up at her as she approaches. Their eyes meet. Aaron has the classic handsome young teacher's no-nonsense expression on his face as she reaches out her hand -- \n4 CONTINUED: 4 \nLISA Thank you, Mr Aaron. She walks back. On her test he's written: B- \"SEE ME1\" \n5 INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM. DAY. LATER. 5 \nAFTER CLASS -- The last students go out as Mr Aaron gestures for Lisa to take a seat. \nMR AARON Take a seat, Lisa. I just wanna talk about your test for a minute. \nLISA \n(SITTING) Sure. \nMR AARON Now...I know you had a little help... \nLISA Well -- I mean -- I didn't cheat, if that's what you mean. \nMR AARON I'm just saying I know you had a little help. \nLISA A lot of people did. \nMR AARON Be that as it may -- \nLISA I mean I'll take it over again if you want, but like, what would be the point? It's not like I'm ever gonna actually need to know this stuff in my daily life... \nMR AARON Well, Lisa, that's just not necessarily true. Haven't you ever developed an interest in something you didn't initially think you were going to develop an interest in? \nLISA Um, no, not really. \nMr Aaron looks down for a moment to hide his amusement. Lisa looks at him with secret adoration. He looks up. \n5 CONTINUED: 5 \nLISA (CONT'D) Anyway, it was open book. So what's the big difference-between using a book and like, I don't know, using somebody else's mind who's like, really good at math? It's not like this person did the whole test for me. \nMR AARON Oh no? \nLISA No. I did some of it. She smiles at him. He is no longer smiling back. \nMR AARON Well, next time I'd appreciate it if you did all of it. OK? \nLISA You are so fair. \n6 INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY. DAY. 6 \nTRACKING LISA from behind as she walks through the halls past her fellow students. She walks through a door -- \n7 EXT. ALLEY. DAY -- CONTINUOUS. 7 \n-- where kids are smoking. Lots of butts on the ground. The walls covered with graffiti. Lisa goes to her friend BECKY and takes out her cigarettes. A kid named KURT smokes nearby. \nBECKY What did he say to you? \nLISA Nothing. . .Mr Aaron and I have an understanding about my math problem. Becky laughs. Lisa laughs. \nLISA (CONT'D) He is so appealing. A long-haired kid comes out, followed by a somewhat preppier girl, KIRSTEN, and her look-alike friend LESLIE. \nKIRSTEN OK, Mr Ferrar is such an asshole. \nKURT What'd he do, call on you? \nKIRSTEN Fuck you., Kurt. \n7 CONTINUED: 7 \nLESLIE Kirsten is really upset. \nKURT I'm sorry. \nKIRSTEN \n(TO LESLIE) Let me have one of those, will you? Leslie gives Kirsten a cigarette and lights it for her. \nBECKY Kirsten, I didn't know you smoked. \nKIRSTEN I don't. -I'm just really angry. (to Leslie) Check out what he. said to me last week. She drops her voice. They whisper and then both laugh. Lisa watches them. \nLESLIE Are you serious? Lisa overhears MONICA, an elegant 12th-grader, talking to some other girls seated on the steps. \nMONICA .I just don't think you can really know a guy until you've slept with him. Lisa, listening, is not so sure, but wouldn't know. \n8 INT. AMERICAN HISTORY CLASS. DAY. 8 \nThe class is taught by two teachers; MR KLEIN, 50s, and MR LEWIS, 30s. On the blackboard are scrawled the words \"STRIKERS\" \"PINKERTONS\" and \"PREZ. McKINLEY.\" \nKLEIN .So the President of the United States, William B. McKinley, authorized the use of private detectives to break the strike, and they went out there and shot them down! Just like they did in Virginia, just like they did in Pennsylvania. Because they did not care! They did not care! \nLEWIS (low, rumbling) And that's basically it-That's basically all there is to say. \nKLEIN All right? Go ahead, uhhhhh: Becky. \n8 CONTINUED: 8 \nBECKY Well, Mr Klein...I mean, was there ever a good President of the United States? There is some laughter from the students. \nKLEIN I don't know, Becky. I think that's a good question. What do you think? You. Lionel. What do you think? Did we ever have a good President? \nLIONEL Um...I don't know. I guess most of them have just been totally corrupt. \n- LEWIS Lisa? \nLISA Can I just say, I'm not necessarily like a big fan of all the Presidents of the United States, especially the current one, but I still don't think its necessarily all that useful to categorize every President as universally corrupt, because that just seems very general to me. Especially if you're going to judge them by the standard of -- whatever they're supposed to traditionally be like in some mythical version of America that probably never existed to begin with. ANTHONY, an intellectual smart-ass, leans back in his chair. \nANTHONY Lisa has raised a salient point. There are some laughs from the class. \n9 EXT. SCHOOL. DAY. 9 \nSchool is letting out. LISA walks away from the building. A short energetic kid named DARREN falls in step with her. \nDARREN Hey, how'd you do? \nLISA \n(RESUMES EATING) It is gross. She eats. He watches her. \nCURTIS Do you want to play a game? \nLISA No. \nCURTIS Please! \nLISA I don't feel like it, Curtis. Quit bugging me. \nCURTIS Can I have some pizza? She gives him a piece of pizza. He sits. They eat together. \n11A INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY. 11A \nCurtis is practicing the piano. \n12 INT. LISA'S MOTHER'S BEDROOM. 12 \nLisa, on her cell phone, rummages in her mother's bureau. During the following she finds a small supply of cash and steals forty dollars. \nLISA (On the phone) What are you up to tonight? . Nothing: Darren wants me to go to the movies with him. You want to come? I guess around eight? \n13 EXT. BROADWAY. DAY. 13 \nPOV LISA: slowly passing by Broadway clothing store windows. No cowboy hats. She walks down Broadway window shopping, enjoying herself. \n14 EXT. ANTIQUE CLOTHING STORE. DAY. 14 \nThrough the window, we see Lisa talk to the pretty, mid-20s SALESGIRL with an embroidered cowboy hat. \n14A TIME PERMITTING 14A \n15 EXT. BROADWAY. DAY. 15 \nAs Lisa slowly passes-by and looks in various store windows. She stops and looks at some shoes. REFLECTED IN THE WINDOW, behind her, a city BUS pulls up to a bus stop and wheezes as the doors open. \n16 EXT/INT STREET/BUS. SIMULTANEOUS. 16 The BUS DRIVER is wearing a cowboy hat. He is in his 30s and kind of good-looking. Past the disembarking passengers we see Lisa's back as she scans the shoe store. ON LISA -- She turns around and sees the Bus Driver. She sees his cowboy hat and just as the doors shut -- \nLISA \n(TO DRIVER) Hey! The bus lurches away. Lisa takes off after it. IN THE BUS -- CLOSE on the Bus Driver, oblivious to Lisa, who we can see out the door and window, falling behind. ON THE STREET -- The bus falls behind a slow-moving car and Lisa catches up. IN THE BUS -- Lisa appears at the bus doors, waving and calling out. The Bus Driver sees her, smiles and waves back. ON THE STREET -- Lisa is running alongside the bus. \nLISA (CONT'D) Hey! Where'd you get your cowboy hat? IN THE BUS -- The Bus Driver can't hear her, but smiles at her with good-natured flirtatiousness. ON THE STREET -- The LIGHT at the curb turns YELLOW. THE SLOW-MOVING CAR in front of the bus floors it to make the light. THE BUS DRIVER sees his way is clear and steps on the gas. He turns and waves goodbye to Lisa. She points at her head and then at him. He smiles, not quite getting it. The LIGHT turns RED. Still looking at Lisa, the BUS DRIVER lifts the hat off his head in a farewell salute as.-- LISA sees the bus pass under the RED LIGHT -- \nGoldenrod Revised 10/23/05 - Page 12 \n16 CONTINUED: 16 An Upper-West Side WOMAN, 40s or 50s (Later identified as MONICA PATTERSON) holding some grocery bags steps off the curb between two cars to cross Broadway. \nVERY FAST: THE BUS DRIVER turns his head to look straight forward. POV BUS DRIVER -- Monica is directly in front of him. POV MONICA -- The bus roars up at her. THE BUS DRIVER slams on the BRAKES. POV LISA -- Monica is clipped by the huge bus and pulled tumbling underneath. LISA SCREAMS. Pedestrians all over turn around. MONICA is pulled and crunched in a horrible twisting tumble. Everything stops. TRACKING LISA fast as she runs across the street toward the accident. As she gets closer she sees Monica's leg sticking out from under the bus. Then with some confusion, she realizes that Monica herself is right in front of her, and that her blood is spreading everywhere. Monica is reaching out vaguely, unable to speak. She is making choking sounds. Lisa stands over her for a second, frozen. She crouches down and tries to do something but doesn't know what to do, where to put her hands. Other people start converging. IN THE BUS -- The Bus Driver puts the bus in Park, opens the door and rushes out. WE TRACK him as he comes around to where a crowd has already formed. He hangs back on the outside, but we break through till we find LISA kneeling next to the disoriented MONICA, holding her hand. They are both covered in blood. Several other people are shouting and talking all at once. \n1ST MAN Somebody call an ambulance! Call an ambulance! Everyone calm down! \nKID I'm calling one right now...!

Just picture it in your mind. What color was the light? Lisa looks over at the Bus Driver. He looks back at her. \nLISA I guess it was green? I didn't really see it.

When I'm speaking Spanish, they think I'm french. \nJOAN And what do you do, Ramon? \nRAMON I have a company: We design computer software to help companies in South American countries.that use an incompatible software, so the computers can't talk to each other. It's a big problem in Central and South America, where there is not usually so much coordination in computer communications. So right now there's a big opportunity for us, because for the big software companies it's still in the backwoods. That's changing already, but in the last ten years we have done extremely well.

I think we're gonna have a really \ngood time. \nLISA KARL OK. Well, I love you. .It's gonna be really fun. Um -- Love you too. \nLISA Oh, never mind... They make out. He immediately starts feeling her up. She pushes his hand away. \nPAUL You're not serious. \nLISA Oh... No. He moves his hand back. She lets him. \n60 INT. PARTY HOUSE -- STAIRWELL. NIGHT. 60 \nLisa comes down around the stairs at a mellow drunken pace. She sees Darren sitting by himself on the floor at the end of a dark hallway. She walks over' to him and crouches down. \n60 CONTINUED: 60 \nLISA Hey... You know I really love you, right? \nDARREN Not really. Pause. She kisses him softly and they make out for a minute. \nLISA I guess I'm not very consistent. \nDARREN I don't mind. He kisses her again. She draws back slightly. \n- LISA I gotta go home. \nDARREN \nOK... \n61 INT. RAMON'S BATHROOM. NIGHT. 61 \nJoan sits on the toilet seat naked, smoking, hair tousled, a little overexcited. Ramon KNOCKS. She jumps. \nRAMON (O.C.) Joan? Are you all right? \nJOAN Yes! Fine! Be out in a sec. She gets up, flushes the cigarette, looks in the mirror, tousles her hair, snaps off the light and opens the door. \n62 OMIT 62 \n63 INT. GEOMETRY CLASS. DAY. 63 \nThe. last students file out except Lisa. Mr. Aaron is erasing the blackboard. \nMR AARON Yes, Becky? Um -- Lisa? \nLISA Are you still mad at me about the test? \nMR AARON What's going on, Lisa? \n64 INT. GEOMETRY CLASS - A FEW MINUTES LATER. DAY. 64 \nLisa and Mr Aaron sit at his desk. \n64 CONTINUED: 64 \nLISA .Because maybe my mother is right, and the bus driver is completely devastated as it is. And I'm just gonna be this little rich girl who calls up the cops to ease her conscience, and then ends up ruining somebody's life, when I'm the one who was distracting him in the first place. \nMR AARON What does your being rich have to do with anything? \nLISA You know what I mean. \n- MR AARON No, I don't. \nLISA Oh my God, I don't mean literally rich. My Dad makes like one bad TV commercial like, every two years, and my Mom lives from like, voice-Over to Voice Over. I mean rich compared to the bus driver. \nMR AARON OK...But I still don't see what any of that has to do with what you do or don't want to tell the investigating officers about the accident you witnessed. \nLISA Nothing, I guess. I'm sorry. When you're raised to be a knee-jerk Liberal you tend to think about these things. Lionel and a girl open the door. \nMR AARON Lionel? Tamara? It's gonna be five minutes. \nLIONEL I just thought you'd want to know there's like a lot of people out here and it's getting kind of hard to breathe. \nMR AARON You better close that door now, Lionel. Lionel closes the door. \nMR AARON (CONT'D) All right: I have to let those guys in. I don't want to leave you hanging...If you're really hurtin'...we could get a cup of coffee after school... \n64 CONTINUED: (2) 64 \nLISA I'd do that. Mr Aaron sighs a little. \n64A TIME PERMITTING. 64A \n65 EXT. COFFEE SHOP. DAY. 65 \nThrough a window we see Mr Aaron and Lisa talking (MOS). \n66 INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT. 66 \nLisa is watching TV. Joan comes in dressed for the opera. \nJOAN Does this-make me look fat? \nLISA Um, a little. \nJOAN Well, there's nothing I can do about it. \nLISA Where are you going? \nJOAN The opera...! \nLISA Why are you going to the opera? \nJOAN It turns out he's a really big opera fan...! Anyway, don't you think it's kind of fun? We should all go sometime. \nLISA Uh, no thanks. \nJOAN Why not? I bet you'd like it. \nLISA I don't like that kind of singing. \nJOAN But you like classical music. \nLISA Yes. That's true. But I don't like opera singing. \n66 CONTINUED: 66 \nJOAN LISA But when have you ever -- It's like their entire reason for existing is to prove how loud they can be. I don't really find that all that interesting. \nJOAN Yeah. I know what you mean. But it's not all like that. You like The Magic Flute. \nLISA OK. I guess I'm wrong. I guess I do like opera singing. I just didn't realize it. \nJOAN What is the matter with you? \nLISA Nothing at all! Why are you pushing this? I don't want to go to the opera! \nJOAN Yes! OK! It's called an invitation. I'm not pushing anything! All you have say is \"No thanks!\" \nLISA I did! And then you were like, \"Why not?\" So then I told you, and then you started like, debating me! Like you assume I've never thought this through for myself! Which I have! Many times! \nJOAN OK, well, that was a really Contemptuous assumption on my part. I don't actually like the opera that much myself. But I'm trying to expand my mind. Maybe that's wrong! (Pause) I'm sorry. I guess I'm a little nervous about you guys meeting Ramon. \nLISA Why? What's the big deal? Why are you so influenced by what me and Curtis think? What Curtis and I think. \nJOAN Because obviously if I'm seeing somebody new it would important to me that you guys would like him and that he like you. Why wouldn't I be nervous about that? \nLISA I guess you would. Withdrawn. \n66 CONTINUED: (2) 66 \nJOAN Hey...Why does everything I say annoy you? \nLISA Jesus Christ, I'm just sitting here! \nPAUL That's pretty much what I figured...(Pause) So, do you want to come over here? Should I come over there...? \nLISA Well, my Mom just went out for the evening...Except my little brother's getting dropped off at some point, come to think of it, so I'm actually supposed to be here when he gets home. \nPAUL All right. (Pause) Do you want to give me your address? \nLISA (blushing almost to death) It's 252 West 85th Street... \nGreen Revised 10/7/05 - Page 50 \n70 INT. DARREN'S ROOM/LISA'S ROOM. NIGHT. 70 \nDarren lies on his bed, depressed. He dials the phone. \nLISA (on the phone) Hello? \nDARREN Hey. What are you up to? \nLISA Hey, nothing. Writing my King Lear paper. \nDARREN Really? That's impressive. \nLISA Not really. \nDARREN I've just never known you to be so devoted to your studies before. \nLISA Well, I don't want to fail Humanities. \nDARREN You're not gonna fail Humanities. \nLISA No, probably not. \nDARREN So what did you do tonight? \nLISA Actually, Darren...I don't really feel like talking right now. Pause. \nDARREN \nOK. \nLISA \nOK? \nDARREN Yeah. I'll talk to you later. \nLISA \nOK. \nDARKEN OK, bye. \nGreen Revised 10/7/05 - Page 50A \n70 CONTINUED: 70 \nLISA \nBye. \n70 CONTINUED: (2) 70 Darren hangs up and starts crying. \n71 INT. HALL. NIGHT. 71 \nLisa, dressed up a little and wearing some makeup, opens the door for Paul. He's not dressed up at all. He's smoking. \nPAUL Hey. \nLISA Hey, come in. She steps aside. He passes her and comes in. \nPAUL I think I-just alienated one of your neighbors by smoking in the elevator. \nLISA Oh really? What did they say? \nPAUL She basically said there was no smoking in the elevator. \nLISA That's original... TRACKING them as they come into the living room... \nLISA (CONT'D) So this is the living room. \nPAUL Very livable. \nLISA We like it...My Mom hasn't read any of these books, by the way. \nPAUL Have you? \nLISA Some of them. Not all of them. Paul looks at The Rise And Fall Of The Third Reich. \nPAUL This book is a very cool book. \nLISA Yeah, I think the Third Reich may be a little bit too much for me right now. \n71 CONTINUED: 71 \nPAUL It's pretty hard to put down once you get started. - \nLISA Do you want anything to drink? \nPAUL I'd take a beer. \n72 INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT. 72 \nLisa has two beers out and is looking through drawers. \nLISA OK, I have no idea where the bottle opener is. - \nPAUL Here, lemme have them. He takes the beers and opens them on the edge of the counter. He makes two marks in the counter doing this. \nLISA Thanks. \nPAUL Whoops. I think I just permanently damaged your kitchen counter. Sorry. \nLISA Oh -- that's OK. Don't worry about it. \nPAUL Won't your \"Mother\" be \"Upset?\" \nLISA How come everything you say always sounds so ironic? You don't even have to do anything and it just comes out sounding like, totally ironic and funny. \nPAUL It's just a gift. She laughs nervously. They drink beer. \nLISA So...do you want to see my room? \nPAUL Sure. \n73 INT. LISA'S ROOM. NIGHT. 73 \nThey come into her room. She closes the door. \n73 CONTINUED: 73 \nLISA This is my room. Ta da. \nPAUL Very nice. She realizes she has some stuffed animals on the bed. \nLISA And these are my stuffed animals. \nPAUL Always important to meet the stuffed animals. \nLISA These are some drawings I did...Not that I should be showing them to you, because I know you're like a really good artist, right? \nPAUL I would like to be a really good artist. At this point I think it would be more accurate to say I'm good at drawing. \nLISA \n(FEELING AROUND) Yeah. It definitely did. \nPAUL Honest to God? It's probably OK. The odds are overwhelmingly that it's OK. O.C. the doorbell rings. \nLISA That's my little brother. She gets a bathrobe and goes out. We TRACK HER through the whole apartment. She opens the door for CURTIS. \nLISA (CONT'D) Hi, Curtis. \nCURTIS Hi. We TRACK her back to her room. She shuts the door. PAUL has put on his underwear and is smoking a cigarette. \nPAUL Hey. \nLISA Hey. (sits down) Can I have a drag? (takes a drag of his cigarette) Thanks. \n(MORE) \n75 CONTINUED: (3) 75 \nLISA (CONT'D) (gives it back to him) I'm actually kind of mad at you... \nPAUL Why? (Pause) Why? (Pause) Because we didn't use birth control? \nLISA I guess so. \nPAUL It was at the ready... \nLISA Well, I don't really want to get AIDS, you know? And I really don't want to have an abortion, because I know when you have one at my age it, can be really hard to get pregnant later on, and I definitely want to have children some day. \nPAUL \nDidn't you ever hear of the \"Morning After \nThe Guy Came Too Fast Pill?\" \nLISA Oh, the \"I'm A Total Fucking Moron\" Pill? \nPAUL Well...that's the Canadian name. \nLISA Yes. I prefer not to put too many chemicals inside my body if I can avoid it. I'm sure it's fine...Or not...! \nPAUL Try to listen to me. Right about now is when you're traditionally supposed to freak out. So why don't you just not? You're not gonna get AIDS, because I don't have AIDS -- \nLISA How do you know? Have you been tested? \nPAUL No, but I'm pretty sure I don't have it, because of my demographic. And the odds are you're probably not gonna have to have an abortion either. And since this was your first time, it might as well be a basically happy memory instead of a shitty one. \nLISA I'm sorry. I'm not completely in control of my emotions. (Pause) Anyway...Thank you for deflowering me. \n75 CONTINUED: (4) 75 \nPAUL You're welcome. \nLISA Did it freak you out that I said I love you? \nPAUL No...It didn't freak me out. \nLISA You don't have to say it back, because I know you probably have like no feelings at all for me. \nPAUL I think I_just proved I have some feelings for you. \nLISA You should probably go now... \n76 INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT. 76 \nLisa walks Paul past Curtis who is practicing the piano. \nPAUL Yo. \nLISA That's my brother. \nPAUL What's up? \nCURTIS Hi. Lisa walks Paul to the front door. \n77 INT. LISA'S ROOM. NIGHT. 77 \nShe changes into her pajamas. \n78 LISA'S BATHROOM. NIGHT. 78 She washes her face and brushes her teeth. \n79 INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT. 79 \nShe comes out and settles down next to Curtis to watch TV. \n80 INT. METROPOLITAN OPERA. NIGHT. 80 \nThe audience applauds the opera cast thunderously. Near Joan and Ramon a male opera enthusiast is standing. \n80 CONTINUED: 80 \nOPERA FAN \nBRAVIL BRAVIL \n81 EXT. LINCOLN CENTER. NIGHT. 81 \nJoan and Ramon walk arm in arm away from Lincoln Center. \nJOAN Oh, I loved it! It was so exciting! \nRAMON ' Good! We should go again! \nJOAN But how about those people yelling \"Bravi!\" and \"Brava!\" \nRAMON How do you mean? \nJOAN It's just so pretentious. \"Bravi!\" \"Bravi!\" Why can't they just say \"Bravo?\" \nRAMON Well, it's the plural. \nJOAN I know -- \nRAMON It's the plural of \"bravo.\" It's what they say to acknowledge the ensemble. \nJOAN No, I know, I know it's correct, it just -- don't you think there was something a little pretentious about those people? \nRAMON Pretentious? \nJOAN I don't mean they didn't really enjoy it...But you know how you can really be enjoying something -- but you're also kind of looking around out of the corner of your eye -- because you know people are watching you enjoy it...? Does that make sense at all? \nRAMON Yes, but I wouldn't say that it was pretentious. In Italian you say \"Bravo\" for a man and \"Brava\" for a woman, and \"Bravi\" for the whole company. \n81 CONTINUED: 81 \nJOAN Uh huh? OK, I see what you mean. \nRAMON You use the masculine for the male singer and the feminine for the female singer. \nJOAN Yeah...Anyway, I really enjoyed it. Thank you. \nRAMON We'll have to go again. \nJOAN It was so glamorous...! \n82 INT. SCHOOL THEATER -- LIGHTING BOOTH. DAY. 82 \nLisa is on a headset. Below, on the stage MATTHEW is singing to a girl. \nMATTHEW \n86 INT. LISA'S ROOM./INT. ABIGAIL'S HOUSE. DAY. 86 \nLisa is on the phone. \nLISA Yes, I'm trying to reach Abigail Berwitz? \nABIGAIL This is Abigail. \nLISA Hi, my name is Lisa Cohen. You don't know me...I... \nABIGAIL Yes? Hello? \nLISA Hi. Sorry. Yeah. I was actually calling about your cousin, Monica Patterson? \nABIGAIL \nOK...? \nLISA I was actually there when she had -- during the accident. I didn't know her, but I was the one who was with her when she died... \nABIGAIL \nOK...? \nLISA Yeah. I was sort of holding her hand at the time... \n86 CONTINUED: 86 \nABIGAIL Yes? What can I do for you? \nLISA OK. Well, ummm, I saw her obituary in the paper, but I didn't see anything about a funeral. I assume they had one, because -- \nABIGAIL \n(ON \"ASSUME\")) No. As far as I know they're doing something or other next week. But -- \nLISA I'm sorry: and I was also wondering, she said something about her daughter? \nABIGAIL LISA No. Her daughter -- She wanted someone No -- Her's daughter's to get ahold of her? not alive -- She -- I'm sorry: passed away quite a long time ago. \nLISA Oh my God. Was it...Was she sick? Or was \nIT -- \nABIGAIL She had leukemia. \nLISA Oh my gosh. And -- do you mind if I ask: Was her name Lisa? \nABIGAIL Yes...? \nLISA OK, see, that explains it. See, I think she thought -- \nABIGAIL Could I just interrupt? How did you get this number? \nLISA Oh -- the police -- I asked the Accident Investigating investigator who to contact if I wanted to -- \nABIGAIL \n(ON \"IF\") Well they really shouldn't be giving out my number. (blurts out) This is harassment! \n86 CONTINUED: (2) 86 \nLISA \n(SHOCKED) I'm sorry! -I'm not trying to harass \nYOU -- \nABIGAIL I have been getting calls about this for three weeks! One of Monica's neighbors gave the police my number and all of a sudden I am the focal point for all these arrangements! And I gotta tell you people, I didn't have any kind of relationship with Monica whatsoever, unless you want to count the fact that she held up my children's inheritance for fifteen years. I guess we're just supposed to forget about all that now. And I am more than willing. But the perso n you should be calling is Emily Morrison, who was Monica's friend and is the person who has been dealing with all of this in New York. But it has nothing to do with me. \nLISA I'm sorry! I didn't really know who to \nCONTACT -- \nABIGAIL Now I can give you her number, but I would very much appreciate it if the calls would stop. \nLISA Yes -- Please. Can you hold on while I get a pen? \nABIGAIL Yes, all right. \n87 INT. EMILY'S APARTMENT/COHEN APARTMENT. DAY. 87 \nEMILY MORRISON, 40s, is on the phone in her Upper West Side apartment. She's on the phone with Lisa. \nEMILY I guess it would be all right ...It's only going to be a few close friends, and some clients I imagine... \nLISA Oh so was she a lawyer? \nEMILY Monica? No. She was a social worker. She used to be, anyway. She had -- several careers. \n87 CONTINUED: 87 \nLISA Were you really good friends with her? \nEMILY Yes I was. \n88 INT. COHEN APARTMENT. DAY. 88 \nJoan is reading audition sides. Lisa passes through, dressed somberly. \nJOAN Where you going, sweetie? \nLISA I'm going to that woman's funeral. \nJOAN Are you sure you don't want me to come? \nLISA Why? I don't even know her. \nJOAN I would be coming for you. \n89 INT. EMILY'S CENTRAL PARK WEST APARTMENT. DAY. 89 \nEMILY opens the door for LISA. In the b.g. about thirty people are gathered. A mix of Upper West Siders, social workers, and Monica's multi-ethnic clients. \nEMILY Hi. Are you Lisa? \nLISA Yeah. Thank you so much for letting me come. \nEMILY Why don't you come on in? We're about to start. Do you want anything to drink? \nLISA Oh -- Um -- no thanks. \nEMILY We have bad hors d'oeuvres and good hors d'oeuvres. \nLISA Oh - that's quite all right, thank you. \n90 INT. EMILY'S LIVING ROOM. DAY. 90 \nEveryone is seated on Emily's chairs and borrowed chairs. \n90 CONTINUED: 90 \nEMILY Well-thank you all for coming. \nWOMAN MOURNER Thank you for doing this, Emily. \nTHE MOURNERS Yes, thank you, Emily. \nEMILY As you all know, Monica was not a religious woman. Anybody who ever had to sit through a wedding or a funeral with her knows how she felt about formal occasions. So Harry and Elise and I, when we were talking about this, decided we would just have everyone over and let.anyone who wanted to.talk. about Monica just talk about her. Maybe share some remembrances of her. Some of us know each other, some of us don't. But we're all here because we loved Monica. (She stops. Gets a hold of herself) And because we want to pay tribute to her in a way that might conceivably not enrage her. Everyone laughs slightly. \nEMILY (CONT'D) I don't want to tell anyone what to think, or how to feel. And I don't want to kid myself about the stupid, meaningless way she died, because it would really make her throw up. But I don't want it to become the summation of her life. Because it's not. When her Lisa died I said to her, \"How can you stand it?\" And she said. \"First of all I can't. But I don't want to take away the twelve years she did have, and turn them all into leukemia. Because they weren't.\" So despite the fact that she got -- ripped off, I do think it's important to remember that Monica got a lot out of life. She was the most fully developed person I personally have ever known. She was also impossible to get along with, but that's another story. Everybody laughs. \nDAVID But what are you saying? A thousand Frenchmen can't be wrong? \n2nd Blue Revised 10/28/05 - Page 76 \n96 CONTINUED: (3) 96 \nJOHN No, I'm not saying that. But I would like to move on -- \nDAVID I think he is saying that, because he's comparing human consciousness to flies, and he's saying that we can't see the truth around us because our consciousness is undeveloped. \nJOHN No David, that's not what Shakespeare meant! He says it somewhere else in the play, but I don't want to get hung up on this any more because it's not what Shakespeare meant, and I would really like to move on. David laughs derisively. \n97 OMIT 97 \n98 INT. LISA'S ROOM. NIGHT/KARL'S HOUSE. DUSK. 98 \nLisa is on the phone with Karl. WE CUT BETWEEN THEM. \nLISA Hi Dad. \nKARL Yeah! Hi! How's everything been going? \nLISA OK. How are you? \nKARL Not too bad. Pretty good. I'm sitting here listening to some music. Having a glass of delicious beer. \nLISA That sounds pleasant. \nKARL Yeah. Yeah. How are you? How's the boyfriend situation? \nLISA Well...there's this one guy I sort of had something going with. But he kind of has a girlfriend, so... \nKARL Uh huh? \n2nd Blue Revised 10/28/05 - Page 76A \n98 CONTINUED: 98 \nLISA I realize I'm incredibly enthralling... \n98 CONTINUED: (2) 98 \nKARL You are.

That was a good answer,. \nLISA Anyway, I do think it's a pretty long- standing relationship... \nKARL OK, then you know what? You do nothing. You do absolutely nothing. And one of two things will happen. Either he's gonna start doing back flips to get your attention, or you're gonna send him a crystal clear signal that if he doesn't do back flips he's not gonna get your attention. OK? \nLISA Well, I think he already knows I like him. \nKARL Uh huh? OK... \nLISA .I think I might have spilled the beans on that one a little -- \nKARL That's OK. Because now, if now you stop acknowledging him, you just suddenly give him nothing, he's gonna go berserk. Unless he's just not interested. In which case, you gotta take your lumps. OK? Which is tough. \nLISA Well, thanks, Dad. I'll be sure to try out the technique next time I see him. \nKARL Yeah. Lemme know what happens. \nLISA \n98 CONTINUED: (3) 98 \nKARL OK. Well, everything's OK here...A little \nSLOW -- \nLISA Actually, Dad? I definitely want to hear how things are with you in a minute, but I actually have something kind of serious I want to ask you about ...I'm kind of soliciting people I respect-for their views on this... \nKARL OK. What's up? \n99 EXT. KARL'S HOUSE. DUSK. 99 \nWider, through the glass doors of Karl's bungalow as he listens to the story. \n100 INT. LISA'S ROOM. NIGHT./KARL'S HOUSE. DUSK. 100 \nLISA . so do you think I should go back to the police, or what? \nKARL OK, well, first of all, I'm very glad you told me. Second of all, I think you should let me call my friend who's a lawyer, just to get some idea of what the ramifications would be. \nLISA You mean to protect myself before I go back? \nKARL There's nothing wrong with knowing what you're getting into. I'm gonna call my friend Lorne, I want to see what he says. ANNETTE, Karl's, girlfriend, 40, lets herself into the house. \nANNETTE LISA Hey...! Actually, Dad? Please don't call anybody. KARL Seriously. I appreciate Hi babe. your taking charge and everything, but -- ANNETTE Hello? Did you get my message? \nKARL Um -- I got a message. \n100 CONTINUED: 100 \nANNETTE About the flowers? For my mother? \nKARL I don't know. Yes. Hold on. (To LISA) I'm sorry, Annette just walked in. \nLISA That's OK. \nANNETTE Who are you talking to? \nKARL I'm -- It's -- could I just -- \nLISA Anyway, I guess I would just like to know later that I would have done the right thing by myself, if you see what I mean. Because I don't think I have so far. \nKARL Uh huh? \nANNETTE LISA Who is that? Not that I'm trying to make this woman's KARL horrible death into my own Uh Huh? It's Lisa. personal moral gymnasium... to quote George Bernard ANNETTE Shaw. Good. Will you please ask her \nKARL I'm sorry, Lisa. Hold on one second. \nLISA \nOK. \nKARL \n(TO ANNETTE) Yes. \nANNETTE Will you please ask her if there's anything we don't know about that she won't eat? For the trip? Because I have to tell the ranch, because they do all the meals ahead of time \nKARL Yes: I will: We're just in the middle of something. \n100 CONTINUED: (2) 100 \nANNETTE Karl, I was supposed to call them last week. You said you were gonna call her and you didn't. So then I called her, and she never called me back. So what do you want me to do? \nKARL OK, you know what? I want to talk about this, not right now. \nANNETTE -- and if there's anything she can't eat and they put it in the hampers, she's not gonna have anything to eat. The last time she came out here we went to three different places and she couldn't eat anything on the menu. \nKARL I'm going to ask her. I will. We're right in the middle of something. \nANNETTE OK. Tell her I said hi. \nLISA Yes! I'm upset about the accident! I'm very \nupset about the accident! I was covered in blood! I've never been covered in blood before, and I wanted to talk to you about it for a minute! Why is that so strange!? \nMRS MARETTI Gerry... why don't we all go inside and sit \ndown? \nLISA \n(ON \"WHY\") Could I please talk to you alone? \nMRS MARETTI. OK, what is goin' on here? \nMARETTI Nothin's goin' on here. So whyn't you calm down? Look: Go ahead inside. Let me find out what this is. Meantime whyn't you make sure those kids aren't killin' each other, all right? \nMRS MARETTI All right. \nYellow Revised 10/9/05 - Page 84A \n112 CONTINUED: (2) 112 As Mrs Maretti goes inside: \nMARETTI \n(MORE JOVIALLY) No, you know what?

Speak! \nLISA Well... you probably already know, obviously, that I told-the police on the police report that I thought the whole, thing was an accident... \nMARETTI Uh huh. Right. Because it was an accident. \nLISA Well -- I mean, I know you didn't do it on purpose. \nMARETTI On purpose...? \nLISA But it wasn't like... \nMARETTI What. (Pause) Speak. Talk!

Well...the way I remember the accident is that you were wearing this cowboy hat -- \nMARETTI Yes, it's my cowboy hat that I wear sometimes to amuse myself on the bus, yes. I was probably wearing my cowboy hat, yes. What. \nLISA If you could just let me...! From my point of view, I was out that day trying to buy a cowboy hat, so I was waving at you, becase I was looking for one... and you were kind of waving back...And I know the police already decided it was No Fault, or No Criminality or whatever they call it -- \nMARETTI No Criminality, that's right. \nLISA -- I guess partly because of what I told them. And I know I was distracting you, but -- I did see the bus go through the red light. And that's when it hit that woman. \nMARETTI OK. I'm gettin' a little confused over here. \nLISA Only nobody said that to them. And I just wanted to like, acknowledge with you that that's what happened. \nMARETTI OK. First of all, I don't really know what you mean by wavin' at you...What were you, tryin' to catch the bus...? \nLISA No...Yes. But I wanted to ask about your -- \nYellow Revised 10/9/05 - Page 86A \n112 CONTINUED: (6) 112 \nMARETTI Maybe I was wavin' at you like, wavin' to say, you know, \"Step away from the bus,\" if the bus was in motion, I would've waved you away for your-own safety, but that's all that would be. \nYellow Revised 10/9/05 - Page 87 \n112 CONTINUED: (7) 112 \nLISA You don't remember looking at me and waving at me? Mrs. Maretti comes out again. \nMARETTI No. Not really. No. \nLISA Well ...I think we both remember something different. \nMRS MARETTI Your brother's on the phone. \nMARETTI Tell him I'll call him back. Mrs Maretti goes back inside. \nLISA I'm not trying to get you in trouble. \nMARETTI I know you're not, because you couldn't get me in trouble. Uhhhh, there's no criminality found...the report is, uh, final. And that's it. \nLISA So you're just gonna leave it? \nMARETTI I'm gonna leave it, because that's all that it was. If something else would have happened, I'd take it to whatever that was. It was tragic, it was a tragedy. But there's only a certain speed the brakes can react. That's a physical limitation of the machine. I don't know what else to tell you. It was a shock. It's shock. But that's it. Can't bring her back. Cannot bring her back. \nLISA I'm not talking about bringing her back. .I'm talking about telling the accident investigators what really happened. \nMARETTI But you already talked to them! \nYellow Revised 10/9/05 - Page 88 \n112 CONTINUED: (8) 112 \nLISA I know that. But I lied. \nMARETTI You lied. \nLISA Yes. And I can understand if you don't want to get in trouble, but.-- \nMARETTI Then how come nobody else saw it? \n114 INT. THEATER -- BACKSTAGE/ONSTAGE.

If they were any good somebody would have called me last night. \nLISA No we can't forget it, because I can't take this anymore. What do you care what they say about you anyway? \nJOAN I don't. It's just a lousy feeling. Can't you understand that? If they wrote mean things about you in the newspaper you wouldn't like it. Even if you didn't agree with it, or base your self-esteem on it. Why can't you understand that? \nLISA I do understand it, because we have this conversation every time! You're great in the play, you're a great actress, everybody thinks you're great, everything about you is great, you're really really pretty -- \nJOAN Oh shut up. \nLISA So let me just find the review and then we can both kill ourselves, OK? \nJOAN Fine.

DAY. 121 \nLisa and Becky are smoking pot on a rock or bench. \nLISA (holding in smoke) .Yeah, because the Central Park Conservatory or whatever it's called put up about five hundred miles worth of these cheap shitty-looking fences all over the park. Which is totally antithetical to what the park was originally designed for. She exhales and hands Becky the joint. \nBECKY We are totally gonna miss the game. Oh my God it's John...! It's John! They try to hide the joint from JOHN, the English teacher, who approaches them and stops. Pause. \nLISA Hi John. \nBECKY Hi John. (Pause) Want some?

Whatever happened with that situation? \nLISA Oh...\u00e2\u0080\u00a2I'm working on it. I'll tell you all about it sometime...(squinting at him in the sunshine) Hey, what kind of a bike is that? \nMR AARON Um, a Trek. \nLISA I'm supposed to take a horseback riding trip with my father over Christmas break and I was just wondering, does it bear any resemblance to riding a bicycle? \n122 CONTINUED: 122 \nMR AARON As far as I know, no, it doesn't, no... \nLISA But you must have ridden a lot of horses. \nMR AARON What makes you say so? \nLISA Aren't you from Texas or Wyoming or someplace like that? \nMR AARON Someplace like what? \n- LISA You know: Not New York. \nMR AARON I'm actually from Indiana. But don't let me overwhelm you with superfluous details. \nLISA God, so what are you doing at a New York private school teaching geometry to a bunch of overprivileged liberal Jews? \nMR AARON Is that a real question, or a Lisa question? \nLISA What's a Lisa question? \nMR AARON A question designed to prolong the conversation without there being any particular interest in the actual answer...? \nLISA About half and half. \nMR AARON In that case -- \nLISA Before you go, I am actually thinking of getting one of these. Can I try it? Just for one second? \nMR AARON All right. \nLISA Thanks. \n122 CONTINUED: (2) 122 Aaron gets off the bike. She climbs on. The seat is too high for her. \nMR AARON You want me to adjust the seat? \nLISA No thanks. This actually feels really, really good. God, I'm kidding! You are so easy to tease! She bikes away awkwardly, turns around and bikes back toward him, wobbling badly. \nLISA (CONT'D) I like your bicycle...! Can I have it? \nMR AARON No! She tries to stop in front of him but skids and he catches her hard by the arms to stop her. \nMR AARON (CONT'D) OK. Off. \nLISA Can I just ask you how is it possible that I am totally in love with you and you have almost no interest in me whatsoever? It's not like I'd ever say anything if you ever deigned to like, you know, be with me. \nMR AARON Lisa...! \nLISA I can tell you like me. It's not like I'm a virgin, if that's what you're worried about. I'm not even close. \nMR AARON I can't even be having this conversation with you. \nLISA Yeah, you keep saying that, but I notice you're still standing here. \nMR AARON You're absolutely right. Goodbye. He gets on the bike. \nLISA It's not my fault if I revere you as a god! \n122 CONTINUED: (3) 122 He laughs or smiles briefly in spite of himself. \nLISA (CONT'D) Oh my God. I made you laugh.

A what? \nDAVE Private Investigator -- to see if he could find anything out about your bus driver -- \nLISA Really? \nDAVE EMILY Yeah: So he -- Dave! \nDAVE Wait, let me tell you what he said! So he called this guy he knows who used to be a cop for the MTA. Did you know the MTA have their own police? The MTA police? They have their own uniforms... \nEMILY Yeah? Yeah? Yeah? \nDAVE EMILY And -- Just a minutel Jesus Christ! What do we give a fuck about the MTA police and their uniforms?! \nDAVE -- so this guy got someone to let him sneak a look at your guy's file. And it turns out he's had two previous accidents -- less than two years apart -- one of them on the job, one in his own car -- \nEMILY What? \nDAVE -- where there was some allegation that he was drinking, which was dropped, but, that he's never been cited or disciplined, just moved around to different shifts -- \nEMILY Are you fucking kidding me? \nLISA Why does this not shock me? \nDAVE Because Surprise Surprise his brother-in- law is a very big muckety-muck in the Transit Workers Union -- \nPink Revised 9/25/05 - Page 119 \n134 CONTINUED: (2) 134 \nEMILY (i.e., \"I get it.\") O-Kay...l \nDAVE And if you read the paper, you'll know they're going through a protracted labor dispute at the MTA right now, and according to my PI, the management doesn't want to aggravate the situation by firing this guy. Especially since the police have concluded he was not at fault. \nLISA This is making me sick. \nDAVE I know, but what it means, Lisa, is that we have a case. \nLISA We do? \nDAVE What it means, in fact, is that we have a very good case, because we can sue for what's called \"Negligent Retention.\" Which means they should have known the guy was a bad risk and was irresponsible and they negligently retained him until he finally killed somebody. \nEMILY And you can prove that? \nDAVE Sure, because we can subpoena their Personnel records, which we already know contain damaging information, because my investigator got a look at them beforehand. Which you're not-supposed to do, but we did it anyway. \nLISA \nYOU'RE AWESOMEL \nEMILY And that means... \nDAVE That means we're in great shape and I think we should go in there and sue their fuckin' asses off. \nEMILY But you wouldn't be our lawyer, right? \nPink Revised 9/25/05 - Page 120 \n134 CONTINUED: (3) 134 \nDAVE No no. Oh no. \nLISA Why not? \nDAVE EMILY I'm not a personal injury It's not his area. litigator. I don't know enough about it. I would lose. \nEMILY But you could recommend someone? \nDAVE Sure.

My God. \nDAVE But you gotta get that crazy cousin on board because she's gonna be your beneficiary. \nEMILY She's not gonna want to come to New York, I can tell you that right now. \nDAVE If you win she gets anywhere from three to five hundred thousand dollars. She's gonna come to New York. \n135 EXT. MIDTOWN -- 6TH AVENUE. DAY. 135 \nLisa and Emily walk up the busy avenue. \nLISA What's with Monica and her cousin? \nEMILY Oh, Monica's father left some money to Abigail's kids and he made Monica the executor of the estate, because he didn't want Abigail and her idiot husband to get their hands on the money before the kids were grown up. \n(MORE) \nGreen Revised 10/7/05 - Page 121 \n135 CONTINUED: 135 \nEMILY (CONT'D) For which Abigail rewarded her by badgering her about it on the phone for fifteen years: Always trying to borrow money against the estate, accusing her of making lousy investments with it, nasty phone calls, nasty letters, every month for fifteen years until Abigail's daughter turned twenty-one and got married. Then Monica goes to the wedding, in fucking Arizona, and Abigail literally won't speak to her. She's a dream. \nLISA So that's who we're getting the money for? \nEMILY It's not who we're getting it for, it's who we're getting it from. \n136 INT. DEUTSCH'S OFFICE. DAY. 136 \nEmily and Lisa sit with RUSSEL DEUTSCH, 50s. His law office is slightly smaller and less nice than Dave's. \nDEUTSCH First thing we do is we file a summons and a complaint against the MTA. They get .twenty days to respond, and when they do we can make our Discovery requests: Accident reports, personnel records, et cetera. But you gotta realize it's gonna take some time. The law says you have to get a court date within a year. Usually it takes about six. Depending. \nLISA Six years! \nDEUTSCH Depending, yes. \nEMILY Now, I mentioned to Dave I have a friend who writes for the Metro section of the Times... \nDEUTSCH Yes: Now this, if it could really happen, this changes everything in our favor. If they think there's gonna be adverse publicity, especially in The New York Times, they're gonna want to settle right away, soon as possible, and as quietly as \n141 INT. DEUTSCH'S OFFICE. DAY. 141 \nAbigail sits with Deutsch. \nDEUTSCH How would you describe the relationship overall? Did you talk on the phone a lot? Were there a lot of visits -- \nABIGAIL I would say we talked on the phone a couple of times a month at least. Sometimes more than that...I would call her, she would call me... \nDEUTSCH And what were the nature of these conversations? \nABIGAIL. Oh, family stuff, mostly. Her family, my kids... \nDEUTSCH And she would advise you about your family? That kind of thing? \nABIGAIL Oh, I would say so, yes. \nDEUTSCH Would you have any phone records? Or -- \nABIGAIL I have all my phone bills, if that's what you mean. I didn't record the actual conversations... \n141 CONTINUED: 141 \nDEUTSCH No no -- \nABIGAIL \n(PRODUCES BILLS) You'll see we talked on the phone quite frequently. \nDEUTSCH OK, that's terrific. I see you came prepared...1 \nABIGAIL Well, I wanted to bring everything. \nDEUTSCH Now when they take your deposition you're gonna say the same thing you just told me. Talk about the relationship... \nABIGAIL Uh huh? \nDEUTSCH Kind of advice she used to give you... \nABIGAIL \nOK...? \n142 INT. MIDTOWN RESTAURANT. DAY. 142 \nEmily, Lisa and Abigail sit over their lunch. Abigail is drinking a white wine. \nABIGAIL Now, Emily, where did you find this lawyer? \nEMILY He was recommended by a friend. \nABIGAIL I'm asking because my husband knows a real good New York lawyer, and I'm not entirely comfortable with someone that no one has ever heard of -- \nEMILY My friend's heard of him. He says he's very good.. \nABIGAIL I'm sure he does. But I have a responsibility in this situation, and I would feel a whole lot more comfortable with somebody who didn't just drop in out of the clear blue sky... \n2nd Green Revised 11/20/05 - Page 128 \n142 CONTINUED: 142 \nEMILY He didn't drop in out of the clear blue sky. He was recommended by my friend. But even if we switched lawyers we'd still have to pay him. But it all comes out of the settlement, so it's really up to you. \nABIGAIL No, if you all think he's good... \nEMILY I don't know whether he is or not. My friend thinks he is. \nABIGAIL All right. Now Lisa, what is your involvement in all this? What's your angle? \nLISA I just wanted to...I was just there. \n143 INT. EMILY'S DINING ROOM. DAY. 143 \nEmily comes into the dining room with a cup of coffee. Lisa is standing over the table looking at some of Monica's photos and belongings which are spread out all over the table. Emily starts putting the pictures away in their envelopes. \nLISA Oh my God, is that you? \nEMILY \nThat's me. \nLISA \nAnd that's you and Monica obviously. Oh my \nGod. Is that her daughter? \nEMILY \nUh huh. \nLISA God... So how old was she when she died? \nEMILY \nTwelve. \nLISA God. I can't even imagine. \nEMILY Neither could we. \nEmily sits down and starts sorting through pictures to put \nthem in the box. Lisa sits down too. \n2nd Green Revised 11/20/05 - Page 128aA \n143 CONTINUED: 143 \nLISA You know Monica asked about her when she was dying? \n2nd Green Revised 11/20/05 - Page 128A-129 \n143 CONTINUED: (2) 143 Emily looks up. \nEMILY No. I didn't. \nLISA \nYeah. I think she was confused... like, I \nthink she thought I was her daughter for a minute. And then she was asking me to call her, like to tell her what happened: You know, like she didn't remember she was dead. \nEMILY What do you mean? What did she say? \nLISA She just asked if somebody could call her daughter. But then it got confusing because I said, \"Sure, what's her name?\" And she said her name was Lisa. And I said, \"No, that's my name.\" Because it took me a minute -- I didn't realize we had the same name... Emily does not respond. \nLISA (CONT'D) But I couldn't tell if what I was saying \nwas registering with her. Emily does not respond. \nLISA (CONT'D) But then when I found out her daughter was dead, ever since then I keep having this really strong feeling that some way, for those last five minutes I kind of was her daughter. You know? Like maybe that's the reason I was there: Like in some weird way, this obviously amazing woman got to see her daughter again for a few minutes, right before she died. \nEMILY \n(VERY DRY) I see. And is she still inhabiting your body? Or did she go right back to the spirit world after it was over? \nLISA I didn't mean she ws literally inhabiting my body. I don't believe in all that stuff at all. \nEMILY \nI don't give a fuck what you believe in. \n143A CONTINUED: 143A \nINTERVIEWER ON TV (O.C.) You are! \nJOAN ON TV (O .

Do you think Emily would like to come see the play? I thought you could both come and them maybe we could go out afterwards. \nLISA All right. Let me ask her. \nJOAN Dig in everybody... They start eating. \nLISA I was thinking about spending next year with Dad. \nJOAN \n(SHOCKED) Oh? \nLISA Yeah. You're all worried about my grades. They have really good public schools in Santa Monica, and if Iofficially lived with him, you wouldn't have to worry about my scholarship. \nJOAN Have you talked to him about this? \nLISA We've had some general discussions. \nJOAN \n(TO CURTIS) Do you want to go too? \nCURTIS \n(SURPRISED) Me? \nJOAN Yeah. Do you want to move to LA too? \nCURTIS No. \nJOAN Well, just let me know if you do. \n143B CONTINUED: 143B \nLISA Why are you being like this? \nJOAN Why am I being like what? \nLISA Why are you about to start crying? \nJOAN Because it's your intention to make me start crying! \nLISA No it's not -- \n- JOAN You want to move to LA. Move to LA. \nLISA But why can't this even be mentioned without you taking it personally? I'm just introducing a possibility! \nJOAN \nOH! Joan upsets everything on the table and starts to go. She comes back and upsets more things on the table. \nJOAN Here's a possibility that you can make your own fucking dinner! Here's a possibility LISA that you can do whatever you Jesus Christ! want to do, because I don't What is with you? even care anymore, you heartless little fuckin' bitch! \nLISA Fine! Keep it up!

DAY. 145 \nOn the blackboard Klein finishes writing: SHOULD TEENAGERS \nRULE THE WORLD? YES OR NO? \nKLEIN OK. Go ahead: Kirsten. Lionel: Put your drum away. Lionel stops drumming on his desk with his fingers. \nKIRSTEN I think that teenagers should definitely rule the world, because teenagers aren't corrupted by adult life yet, and they're idealists and they care. And I know a lot of people feel that teenagers are really naive, which they are, many of them. But they still haven't had a chance to get burned out by the disappointments and the harsh realities of learning how to play the game. So yes, I would vote yes. \nKLEIN All right: Lisa? \nLISA I would tend to agree with all of that, except I do think that teenagers don't always necessarily think things through very carefully, and they don't have enough experience to know what the right thing to do is all the time. I also think they tend to adhere to ideologies really easily without having actually bothered to think them through for themselves.-- \nLEWIS Such as what? \nLISA Such as what? Such as, gee, I don't know: the Hitler Youth? \nKLEIN OK... Hitler Youth. \nLISA Or what about all these teenage suicide bombers? Not that I want to get into the whole Palestinian thing again, but assuming you don't think suicide bombing is a good thing, wouldn't you say that's an example of being idealistic without using your critical faculties? \n(MORE) \nGreen Revised 10/7/05 - Page 137 \n145 CONTINUED: 145 \nLISA (CONT'D) And maybe running the risk of having your youthful enthusiasm be co-opted by adults for purposes of their own that you might not even ultimately agree with? Angie's hand shoots up. So do several others. \nLEWIS OK, Angie? \nANGIE Yeah, I don't want to get into the whole Palestinian thing again either, because I realize I'm completely outnumbered -- \nANTHONY Not unlike the Palestinians themselves. \nANGIE That's not really funny, Anthony. ANGIE (to LISA) KLEIN -- and I'm not even going to Segal: Cut the comedy. comment on the fact that you just compared a 19-year-old ANTHONY Palestinian to a member of I thought it was funny... the Hitler Youth, which I personally find so offensive LISA I don't even know where to \u00e2\u0080\u00a2That's right! Because start -- Oh, it's not because they both like to kill they've been occupied and Jews. humiliated and bombed out of their homes for the last KLEIN fifty years? Hey! Hey! Lisa!

There's ANGIE still a million Pale- If anyone's acting like stinians who don't blow Nazis it's the Israeli up children on busses government! because they're so \"frustrated!\" \nLEWIS OK, OK! Monica? \nMONICA Well, I don't know if this is good or bad, but speaking of ideology, it's interesting that the suicide bombers -- just for example -- care enough about what they believe in to sacrifice their lives for it. \nWHEREAS \n2nd Blue Revised 10/28/05 - Page 138 \n145 CONTINUED: (2) 145 \nANGIE Yes. Yes! \nLISA I think it's fine if you want to sacrifice your life for what you believe in. I actually think that's really noble. It's a little different when you're willing to sacrifice someone else's life, you know? I personally don't think that's such a big ideological achievement! \nANGIE Um, even if there's no other way to get you out of my country? \nLEWIS LISA Raise your hands! They haven't tried any other ways! It's not ANGIE like killing civilians Yes they have! They're is their last resort! trying it right now! It's their first resort! Because it's easy and they like it! \nANGIE (CONT'D) Oh they like it? They're just bad people and they like it? \nSome kind of fund? For the kids? \nDEUTSCH I don't understand what you mean by a fund... \nROB ABIGAIL (to ABIGAIL) Mr. Deutsch? Do you mean What does he mean, \"besides some kind of trust fund, the damages?\" a fund that would be set up by the bus company for EMILY our kids? For tax purposes? What fuckin' fund? \nLISA These people are retarded. \nABIGAIL Because I have to tell you we have just lived through that nightmare with Monica and our children, and it was not a pleasant experience. We just want a clean, straight damages is fine. A regular payment. We'll pay the taxes on it. At least we'll have something in our hand... \nDEUSTCH I don't really know what kind of fund you're talking about... \nLISA We're not talking about -- Hi, this is Lisa? We're ABIGAIL talking -- We're talking Hello, Lisa. about -- Hello? \nGreen Revised 10/7/05 - Page 152 \n157 CONTINUED: (4) 157 Pause. \nABIGAIL We're still here. \nLISA We're talking about the driver, getting the driver fired -- \nABIGAIL Oh, yes -- \nLISA -- as part of the conditions. \nEMILY Yes, Abigail, it's very important to us that the company know that's an absolute pre-condition to making any kind of settlement whatsoever. \nABIGAIL Oh yes. Absolutely. If you think he's at \nFAULT -- \nROB Just as long as they don't think they can buy us off just by gettin' rid of this guy. You see what I mean? \nDEUTSCH Absolutely. \nROB What we're most concerned about here is the amount. \nEMILY Yes, we're getting that, Rob. \nROB But you see what I mean? \nDEUTSCH Yes -- Rob? Yes I do. \nROB I just want to go on record as saying I think this whole meeting is premature. \nABIGAIL Absolutely. We're not lawyers -- \nDEUTSCH Abigail? Rob? I just wanna make something clear. One conversation does not commit you to anything. \n(MORE) \nGreen Revised 10/7/05 - Page 152A \n157 CONTINUED: (5) 157 \nDEUTSCH (CONT'D) And I'm not gonna agree to anything without consulting you.

Joan is on the sofa. \nJOAN Lisa, I'm really proud of you! \nLISA Thank you. \nJOAN Really, really proud...! \nLISA Thank you. Pause. Joan gets to her feet and starts tidying up. \nLISA (CONT'D) Are you upset about something...? \nJOAN No. This house is really beginning to get to me. And I'm a little confused what to do about Ramon. I mean, you were there: What do you think? \nLISA Uh, gee, Mom maybe you should really think about it some more. Because it would probably hurt Ramon's feelings if you broke up with him and I think you better think about it before you do something like that to him. \nJOAN I know I'm supposed to understand what you're doing right now, but if there's some kind of hidden message here I'm not getting it. \nLISA No shit. You're on your own, Mom. \nJOAN Thanks a lot. \nLISA You're welcome. The PHONE RINGS. Joan picks it up. \n158 CONTINUED: 158 \nJOAN \n(INTO PHONE) Hello? -Yes . WHAT DO YOU MEAN?? \nLISA What's the matter? \nJOAN \n(LISTENING) Yes? . Yes? (To LISA) Ramon had a heart attack. \nLISA What? Is he gonna be -- \nJOAN uiet! CURTIS appears. They both watch Joan at the phone. Instead of dissolving, Joan listens, straightens up and calms down as the person on the phone talks. \n159 EXT. RIVERSIDE CHAPEL. DAY. 159 \nMourners are going inside the funeral parlor. \n160 INT. FUNERAL PARLOR. DAY. 160 \nJoan and Lisa look around the room. \nLISA OK, I'm really not trying to be funny, but isn't this a Jewish funeral home? \nJOAN I guess they do both. They notice a few too many good-looking women crying a little too hard. Lisa and Joan look at each other. RODRIGO, a handsome slender kid of 20, comes up to Joan. His accent is British, with a slight Colombian cadence. \nRODRIGO Excuse me. Joan? \nJOAN Yes. You must be Rodrigo. Oh my God, oh I'm so sorry. She impulsively embraces him. \nJOAN (CONT'D) Rodrigo, this is my -- \n160 CONTINUED: 160 \nRODRIGO I want to tell you, Joan, my Dad talked about you all the time. \nJOAN He did? \nRODRIGO Yes. The night he met you, he called me in England and woke me to tell me about it, he was so excited. I never heard him talk about anyone like that since my mother died. \nJOAN Really? \nRODRIGO I don't know if this is appropriate... \nJOAN No it's OK...! \nRODRIGO .but he went out a lot. Do you know the last time I spoke to him he told me from the moment he met you he knew he wanted to marry you, because for the first time since he lost my mother, he finally met a woman he could really connect with. \n", "test1_input": "DAVE Yes. This is good. Because the executor of the estate Cdn bring a Wrongful Death suit, but the beneficiary has to be a relative. So let me explain about that. In a Wrongful Death suit you can sue for Pain and Suffering, Pecuniary Losses, Lose of Support or Services.. .And also what's called Care, Comfort and Society: --like advice, counseling of the parent that the kids aren't gonna get anymore... \nLISA You can really sue for that? \nDAVE Yeah, and that's probably what we would do, \nLISA So -- I don't understand. Who are we suing? The bus driver? \nDAVE Well, no, because the bus driver wouldn't have any money. You basically sue everybody and hope something sticks. The person who pays will be the MTA's insurance company. \nLISA But do you think the driver would get fired? \nPink Revised 9/25/05 - Page 109A \n128 CONTINUED: (2) 128 \nDAVE No. Not necessarily. \n128 CONTINUED: (3) 128 \nLISA Even if all the facts came out at the trial? \nDAVE Maybe. I don't know. \nEMILY But how much could they be liable for? \nDAVE EMILY It depends: How badly do you think we could ever hurt them? \nDAVE -- if she was alive, in great pain for an extended period of time, they give more money for that. \nLISA I'd say she was alive for ten minutes. \nDAVE And I gather in a lot .of pain? \nLISA Her leg was cut off. \nDAVE Yes -- obviously. And -- but was she conscious? Awake, the whole time? \nLISA I'm sorry, Emily. (To DAVE) Yeah, awake. \nEMILY That's OK. \nDAVE Well, if she was in a lot of pain for that long ...I don't know. . .maybe 300,000 or a half a million dollars to get a sustainable verdict? A brain damaged baby would be\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 three million. But the truth is, Lisa, after all's said and done, it's not a very good case. \nLISA Why not? \nDAVE Because it's your word against his, and because you already lied on your first deposition. A red light case is a fifty- fifty proposition already. And with only one eyewitness, with two conflicting statements? I wouldn't take-that case. \nPink Revised 9/25/05 - Page 111 \n128 CONTINUED: (4) 128 \nEMILY Nobody really cares about getting a lot of money here. \nDAVE I understand that -- \nEMILY We just want this prick to Buffer. and we want the bus company to take resonsibility for hiring this guy. \nDAVE I understand. But no matter how you slice it, the fact that Lisa lied on her first statement is a disaster for your lawyer. \nLISA Can't I explain why I lied the first time? It's not like I'm trying to get any money for myself. \nDAVE That's true-Since she have no financial interest she can't be impeached for bias. \nEMILY Impeached for what? \nDAVE She can't have her credibility attacked on financial grounds because the jury knows you're not getting any money if you win. \nLISA So that's'something, isn't it? \nEMILY But do you really think we know what that means? \nDAVE I'm sorry. That's what its called. \nEMILY But who are you talking to? You know we don't know what that means. It's like you're not really concentrating. \nDAVE I -- don't know. I am concentrating. I'm just thinking out loud. \nEMILY OX. All right. I'm sorry...I \n(TO LISA) \n(MORE) \nPink Revised 9/25/05 - Page 111A \n128 CONTINUED: ( 5) 128 \nEMILY (CONT'D) He wasn't always a lawyer you know. He used to be a very nice little boy. \nPink Revised 9/25/05 - Page 112 \n128 CONTINUED: ( 6) 129 \nDAVE Anyway.. the only thing I could think of is it i@ the MTA. So they're not gonna want a lot of publicity. \nLISA Anyway, the whole point is to get this guy -- \nEMILY Is to fucking get this guyl \nLISA No, its to get him out from behind the wheel of a bus! \nDAVE Did she know she was dying? I only ask because the terror of knowing you're dying raises the damages. \nLISA I think she had a pretty good idea. \nDAVE If she had lived for a couple of days it would make the case better...I know this sounds horrible, but this is what it comes down to... \nEMILY I know. We know, Dave. That's OK. Silence. Emily starts to speak: \nDAVE I actually did have one more thought...I do know one guy who's, uh... You know what? Yo know what I want to do7 I want to make a few phone calls, and then, just let me get back to you. \nEMILY I would just like somebody to take responsibility for what happened. \n128A TIME PERMITTING. 12 BA \n129 INT.

WE CUT BETWEEN THEM. \n130 CONTINUED: 130 \nMITCHELL Detective Mitchell. \nLISA Oh, hi, it's Lisa Cohen calling. \nMITCHELL Hi Lisa, what can I do for you? \nLISA Well, I was just wondering what ever happened, if anything, with the case. You said you might re-interview the bus driver... \nMITCHELL \nYes, we did:.We brought him back in -- \n", "test1_true": "MITCHELL Well, he basically stuck to his original representation, and that was pretty much it. I brought it up with my sergeant, but he agrees with me we still don't have enough to charge this guy, so there's really not a lot more we can do at this point. \nLISA But how did you ask the questions? \nMITCHELL Excuse me? \nLISA He's obviously not gonna change his \nstatement if you just ask him like really politely: Why would he? We already know he's a liar. \nMITCHELL Hey, you know, Lisa, in the old days we'd just throw him in the back with a rubber hose and we'd get whatever answer we want out of him. But fortunately we don't do that kind of thing anymore -- \nLISA Yeah, not to white people. \nMITCHELL Excuse me? \n130 CONTINUED: (2) 130 \nLISA You don't do it to white people. Anyway, I'm not saying you -- \nMITCHELL We don't do it to who? \nLISA Oh my God... \nMITCHELL First of all, I don't know why you're bringin' the guy's race into it. There's forty thousand cops in this city -- \nLISA Yes, thank you, yes. \nMITCHELL -- and I hate to disillusion you, but most of 'em are pretty good guys, just tryin' to do their job. Bottom line is the DA's not gonna take this case. (Pause) Now you could talk to my sergeant if you want to, but -- \nLISA Yes, I would. \n131 INT. COHEN HALLWAY/KITCHEN. DUSK. 131 \nJoan, dressed to go to work, drops her keys in her purse as she comes down the hall and lingers in the kitchen doorway to find LISA on the phone, listening, then: \nLISA So there's no way to appeal -- \nSERGEANT V.O. (over the phone, flat) There's nothin' to appeal. There's no case. \nLISA But how do you know Detective Mitchell interrogated him aggressively enough if you weren't there? \nJOAN What's going on?

Joan is smoking. \n132 CONTINUED: 132 \nJOAN -- so funny: it's the same show, but now they all read how great it is, we get these big standing ovations every night, and it's the exact same show as before. \nRAMON But why do you put yourself down? It's a wonderful show and a wonderful performance. \nJOAN No, it's not -- I'm not putting myself down. It's just that the audience always reacts differently if they've been told it's good. A lot of actors have that experience. \nRAMON Mm hm? She takes a few steps away. \nJOAN I love this view...(Pause) You know, Ramon...this may sound very stupid to you, but do you ever worry that we don't have very much in common? \nRAMON What do you mean? \nJOAN Well, I don't mean to sound dissatisfied, or disgruntled. But I feel like we're always misunderstanding each other. Do you feel that way at all? Or am I just completely off the beam? \nRAMON I don't think we should talk about that, Joan. \nJOAN You don't? Well...I think it's kind of important or I wouldn't have brought it up. \nRAMON Joan... I like you very much. But let's not talk about what you are like, and what I am like. That never makes a good result. Talk about it with your friends. \nJOAN My friends...! \nRAMON Yes. \n2nd Pink Revised 11/17/05 - Page 116 \n132 CONTINUED: (2) 132 He sips his drink. Joan doesn't know what to say. Pause. \nRAMON (CONT'D) May I show you some pictures of my boys? \nJOAN Sure. Just don't tell me what they're like. \n132A INT. RAMON'S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT. 132A \nRamon and Joan are in his modernistic, scrupulously clean carpeted living room, on the sofa, looking at pictures. \nRAMON That's a little place we used to go on holiday, two hours outside of Cartagena...My family is all there still, but Rodrigo is studying in London, and Hector is in Geneva. \nJOAN Uh huh... \nRAMON I'm sure they will go back eventually, because they like to do something for their country. But it's a worry, because it's very bad there now. \nJOAN Yeah...I haven't really been following it. \nRAMON It's a big, big mess. Last year I helped to found an organization to work with children whose families have been killed, or the parents have been kidnapped, so they don't know if they are alive or dead. We try to find homes for them, preferably in Colombia, because if we lose our young people, that's it: That's the future. We have raised a lot of money, but there's only so much we can do. You don't like to say it's hopeless, but it's hard to see the solution. \nJOAN Yeah. God...I wish I knew more about it...Do you mind if I ask you something? \nRAMON Of course not. \nJOAN Why are you interested in me? \n2nd Pink Revised 11/17/05 - Page 116A \n132A CONTINUED: 132A \nRAMON You don't think I should be? \nJOAN I just feel kind of ignorant about your whole world... \nRAMON You think it would be better if we knew about all the same things? \nJOAN Not really, not exclusively. It's just unusual. Don't you think it's unusual? \n2nd Pink Revised 11/17/05 - Page 117 \n132A CONTINUED: (2) 132A \nRAMON Not for me. \nJOAN I guess you travel a lot. I've only been out of the country a few times in my whole life. \nRAMON You should travel more. \nJOAN I know. I've always wanted to. It's hard when you're in the theater... \nRAMON Still, you should try. It's a big world. You're an artist. You should see more of it. \nJOAN I know. You don't have to keep saying that. I've always wanted to travel. It's just a little difficult with two kids and no husband, but it's hard to make a lot of money in the theater. I was on a TV show a few years back and I socked away some money because of that, but my ex-husband -- \nRAMON Karl. \nJOAN Karl, yes, you remembered, very good. Karl's very generous with the kids when he can be, but he's struggling too: He's a director: he directs commercials, and now he's trying to produce them... Anyway, I'm not ignorant because I enjoy it. \nRAMON I don't say you're ignorant... Do you think Lisa will be interested in acting? \nJOAN I don't think so. I think's she's got a lot of contempt for it. Of course that may be the age. \nRAMON She would prefer the world with no plays? No films? \n", "test1_id": 861, "test2_input": "150 CONTINUED: 150 \nLISA Well...? How's that anti-Semitic piece of shit Ramon?- \nJOAN Oh God, I don't know. The PHONE RINGS.

I'm really looking forward to our horseback riding trip... \nKARL Yeah. That's why I'm calling. I don't think it's going to happen. \nLISA Really? What's the matter? \nKARL Nothing's the matter. Nobody seems to really want to go, and I don't really feel like spending three thousand bucks on something nobody has the slightest interest in. So I think it's obviously better for everyone if we just cancel. \nLISA I never said I didn't want to go. \nKARL Well, I can't seem to get a straight answer about what anybody wants to eat, um, Annette is giving me a hard time about her schedule, I talk to Curtis and all I get are monosyllables, so -- \nLISA I think-he's really looking forward to it -- \nKARL Uh huh? Well, you know, that hasn't really been my impression. So, uh...I also think it would be good to shelve the idea of your coming out here next year. \n(MORE) \n151 CONTINUED: 151 \nKARL (CONT'D) It looks like things are gonna start picking up for me in the Fall, which means I'm probably not gonna be around the house all that much, and since you and Annette detest each other, I don't, uh, I don't think that's what I want to come home to after a fourteen hour day. \nLISA We don't detest each other \nKARL OK, well, it doesn't really strike me as something you're that serious about anyway, so what do you say we just table it for the time being? \nLISA \nOK. \nKARL OK. So tell Curtis, uh, that New Mexico's off...Ummm, and I will talk to you, ummm, whenever. \nLISA \nOK... \nKARL Yeah. He hangs up. LISA hangs up too. \nJOAN What's wrong? \nLISA Dad's cancelling the trip. \nJOAN What? Why? \nLISA He's says nobody wants to go and he doesn't want to spend the money. \nJOAN Did you say you didn't want to go? \nLISA No, I know there was some problem with Annette about arranging for food because I don't eat dead animals, but.I didn't think it was.going to wreck the whole trip. \nJOAN Oh boy. \n151 CONTINUED: (2) 151 \nLISA I thought you said it sounded like it was going to be a disaster. Personally I'm relieved. I'm not moving out there, either, by the way, obviously. Which is fine too. \n152 INT. KARL'S HOUSE. DAY. 152 \nKarl sits holding the phone in a savage depression. \n153 INT. MR AARON'S APARTMENT. DAY. 153 \nLisa sits on a sofa. She takes a sip of coffee. \nLISA Thank you for letting me come up. I don't know who else to talk to. She's talking to MR AARON, who looks very uncomfortable. \nMR AARON That's all right... \nLISA You've always been very sympathetic to my craziness, and I may not show it all the time, but I actually really appreciate it. \nMR AARON It's no problem, Lisa. What's been going on? \nLISA I just need to talk to somebody who doesn't completely misunderstand who Iam. Or not even who I am, but what's going on inside me, or all around me. Sound confused enough? Anyway, for whatever reason, I always felt like we understood each other on some level, even though I'm like a mass of conflicting impulses and you're basically the most grown-up, rational man I know. \nMR AARON Well...I doubt that's actually true but thank you... \nLISA You seem pretty fuckin' rational to me. Like that seems to be your leading feature. I mean you obviously have a lot of pretty deep feelings...So when you're rational - just to finish my thought -- it's like this really interesting way of governing yourself. \n(MORE) \n153 CONTINUED: 153 \nLISA (CONT'D) And you don't have to get all uncomfortable again: I'm not talking about what you think I'm talking about, because I know that subject is-off-limits. I'm talking about your soul, I guess, and how you feel you have to keep it in check all the time by being sensible. Do you know what I'm saying at all? \nMR AARON Well...We all have feelings, Lisa. I happen to believe that who you are comes out of how you deal with those feelings. Somebody makes you mad, you don't just pick up a gun and shoot them...Or if you do, that says something about who you are, and how you've been raised... \nLISA Well, I don't want to disillusion you, but we happen to be living in a world where that is what people do. More often than not. \nMR AARON That's not true, Lisa. I think it's very sad that you see it that way. There's eight billion people alive in the world and you think they don't all want to kill someone once in a while? But they don't. Most of them. Or they see some person they -- (Pause) I think most people do try to be civilized by some standard. Even if it's a standard you and I might not agree with... \nLISA No, I get it. That's actually the most hopeful thing anybody's said to me for a long time. I don't know why I take such a dire view of things, I really don't. She removes her jacket. She's wearing a small clingy T-shirt. \nLISA (CONT'D) Just a little hot...A little warm .Is this all right? \nMR AARON Sure. \nLISA Do you allow smoking in your apartment? \nMR AARON You can smoke. She gets her cigarettes out and lights one. He gets up and brings her an ashtray. They meet at the sofa and sit. \n153 CONTINUED: (2) 153 \nLISA I like your apartment. \nMR AARON Thank you. She blows some smoke out and waves it away. \nLISA Sorry. \nMR AARON That's all right. \nLISA This is terrible. \nMR AARON What is? What's terrible? \nLISA I just like you so much...(Smooths her ash on the ashtray.) Sorry. What a moron. \nMR AARON (taking her hand) Hey. Lisa. I'm your friend. And that's not gonna change. That's not gonna change. \nLISA Thanks. Thank you. She kisses his hand a couple of times. \nMR AARON Lisa... \nLISA Please just let me for a second. I like you so much. I like you so, so much. She kisses his hand more elaborately. He lets this go on. She lifts her head up and they kiss for real. After a moment she slides her hand onto his leg. \nMR AARON OK, look... \n", "test2_true": "MR AARON Please don't do that. \n153 CONTINUED: (3) 153 \nLISA Just let me for one second...

It's OK. \nMR AARON Are you all right? \nLISA Yes, yes, you don't have to keep asking me that. \nMR AARON I think we should stop. \nLISA No, keep going...! She keeps pushing against him. \n155 INT. MR AARON'S APARTMENT. LATER. 155 \nAT THE DOOR. She is leaving. He is burning with guilt and shame. Silence. Then: \nLISA All I can say is I better get a pretty fuckin' good grade in geometry this year. (Pause) Lighten up! I'm kidding. \nMR AARON Sorry. I really didn't expect anything like this to happen. I'm really not sure how to react. \nLISA Don't worry. I'm not gonna tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. I totally initiated the whole thing. \n(MORE) \n155 CONTINUED: 155 \nLISA (CONT'D) Anyway, it's just sex. You're acting like a little kid. I'll see you in school. She walks out.

I just had the thought -- \nABIGAIL (CONT'D) Mr Deutsch -- I'm just gonna give my husband the floor because he had a few \nQUESTIONS -- \nGreen Revised 10/7/05 - Page 150 \n157 CONTINUED: 157 \nROB Mr Deutsch, I had the thought, if they're willing to settle so quickly, maybe we're better off waiting a little bit, maybe rattling the sabre a little bit more... \nABIGAIL Yes, if they're so quick to agree to a settlement on this basis -- \nDEUTSCH What you gotta realize -- What you gotta \nREALLY -- \nEMILY Abigail, Russel doesn't think -- Sorry, go \nahead. \nDEUTSCH \nNo, no... \nEMILY My friend had a lot of trouble getting the one story placed in the paper as it is -- \nDEUTSCH .Could I interject? \nABIGAIL But if they responded so strongly based on one story... \nROB Maybe we're cuttin' our own throats here. \nDEUTSCH They are responding to the story in the paper... \nABIGAIL .That's just common sense. \nDEUTSCH But what you gotta understand is they're offering to settle now because they want to get the story out of the paper. \nEMILY LISA That's why Russel thinks -- Besides, the main point is not to jack up the price. \nABIGAIL I'm sorry -- \nROB -- We didn't hear that last. \nGreen Revised 10/7/05 - Page 150A \n157 CONTINUED: (2) 157 \nDEUTSCH (to EMILY and LISA) Ladies, let me just -- Abigail. Rob. \n(MORE) \nGreen Revised 10/7/05 - Page 151 \n157 CONTINUED: (3) 157 \nDEUTSCH (CONT'D) If I could finish my thought -- They're jumpin' at the bait right now, but if another six months goes by we run a serious risk of losing our momentum. You see what I mean? Now I'm gonna hit 'em very very hard, I guarantee you. That's why I wanted all of us together on the phone, so we could talk about your other terms, besides the \ndamages. I promise you, we'ere gonna be \nvery very aggressive -- \nABIGAIL What other terms would there be? \nROB What do you mean, like some kind of a fund? \nDEUTSCH A what? \nROB \n", "test2_id": 862, "test3_input": "ROB \nMr Deutsch...? \nDEUTSCH \nNow, I know there was a concern after our \nlast call that we were jumping the gun a little bit -- \nROB That's OK -- \nABIGAIL We're only -- \nEMILY Abigail? Rob? If we could just listen to \nwhat Russel has to say, and then talk about it once he's told us the whole story and given us his recommendation... \nROB Yes. Sorry. Fire away. \nDEUTSCH I was gonna say I know there was a concern \nafter our last call that we were jumping the gun a little bit -- \nROB That's OK -- \nABIGAIL We were just -- \nEMILY Would you let him talk please?! \nDEUTSCH It's OK. \nABIGAIL We're sorry. \nDEUTSCH I want to tell you I think it's a very good offer. \n(MORE) \n167 CONTINUED: (2) 167 \nDEUTSCH (CONT'D) I think they're very anxious to settle, but I also do think that at this moment they're under the maximum amount of pressure we can really bring to bear, and I don't believe they're gonna come up any higher -- \nABIGAIL Hey. Three hundred and fifty thousand dollars... \nROB OK, now let me just -- \nABIGAIL \n.that's nothin' to sneeze at. \nROB ABIGAIL I just want to introduce Now, 1 think -- Can the thought -- you all hear me? \nDEUTSCH, EMILY, LISA Yes! \nABIGAIL Yeow! Was that everybody? OK: \nLISA What about -- \nABIGAIL -- Emily? What do you think? \nEMILY I think it sounds like we should do it. But I'd like to discuss some of the -- \nABIGAIL \n(ON \"BUT\") Hey, if that's the vote... \nROB Unless you think there's something to be gained from holding out for more. \nDEUTSCH I think it would be a big mistake. \nABIGAIL Robbie, what do you think? \nROB Sold! \nABIGAIL Sold! \n167 CONTINUED: (3) 167 \nDEUTSCH OK. Now the only down side to this as it stands -- and the reason I asked Emily and Lisa to be here is because I know this may be a serious wrinkle for you all -- is that \nthe bus company will absolutely not discuss the removal of the driver. \nLISA & EMILY What? \nLISA What do you mean? \nROB The driver? \nLISA EMILY Then forget it. Tell them to What do you mean they forget it. won't discuss the removal of the driver? \nDEUTSCH Please. Ladies. Let me ROB finish what I'm saying. Whoa -- hello! \nABIGAIL It's just a blast in our ears. \nEMILY \n(TO LISA) Let him finish. \nLISA Finish what? Forget it! \nDEUTSCH \n(TO EMILY) Thank you. I want you to understand, Lisa, I pressed them very very hard on this, but they will not discuss disciplining of a company employee as part of the settlement because it could be seen as an admission of guilt on the part of the MTA -- \nLISA What does giving us three hundred thousand dollars mean? \nDEUTSCH Settling out of court does not imply an admission of guilt. It simply does not carry the same stigma. On top of that you may not know, Lisa, they're involved in a very tricky labor dispute at the MTA right \nNOW: \n167 CONTINUED: (4) 167 \nLISA Yeah, we know all about that! Just tell them to forget it.' \nDEUTSCH I know that's your reaction... \nLISA It's the only reason we're here. \nROB Can I jump in here? Russel? \nDEUTSCH \n(TO LISA) .but it's really not your decision. \nROB ABIGAIL Hello? Are you still with us? Please! \nLISA It's Emily's decision. \nEMILY No. \nDEUTSCH No. \nROB Hello? \nLISA It's not? \nABIGAIL They're not listening, Robbie. \nDEUTSCH It's Abigail's decision because she's the next of kin. \nLISA But she didn't even know about it! \n", "test3_true": "ABIGAIL Could we get back in this conversation please? \nDEUTSCH Yes. I'm sorry. Obviously there's some very strong emotions going either way on this -- \n167 CONTINUED: (5) 167 \nABIGAIL Listen, Emily? I don't know what you're thinking, but Rob and I are thinking we should take Russel's recommendation while we can. Because if they won't fire the guy, they're not gonna fire him. And six months or a year from now we're gonna -- \nROB Exactly. \nABIGAIL we're gonna be in a situation where we're beggin' them for half this much, which is gonna hurt 'em half as much as now, and they're still not gonna fire this guy! Or maybe he'll have already quit and the whole thing will be moot by then.. Do you see what I mean? \nLISA The entire point of the lawsuit was to get the guy fired so he doesn't kill somebody else -- ! \nDEUTSCH Lemme just clarify -- \nLISA -- it was not to get you three hundred and fifty thousand dollars you didn't know you were entitled to, for somebody you didn't even like... ! \nABIGAIL This is a distortion -- \nLISA And the only reason you're getting the money at all is because I started this whole fucking thing in motion! I'm sorry for swearing, but you should be willing to trade in all the money for getting this guy off the street -- \nEMILY For getting him, Abigail! \nABIGAIL Well I'm sorry, but I have a responsibility to Monica and I take that responsibility very seriously. You are talking about an offer that is gonna be withdrawn if we don't do something about it right now. \n(MORE) \n167 CONTINUED: (6) 167 \nABIGAIL (CONT'D) And rather than being abused over the telephone and cursed at for having the courtesy to involve you in these discussions, Lisa, I would hope you would be guided by our judgement. Unless I'm wrong about that. \nLISA None of that matters -- \nABIGAIL Unless I'm wrong about that. Just what is your interest in this? \nLISA Because I'm the one who killed her! I'm the one who killed her! But at least I know I did it, and that guy has no idea! And he's wandering around blaming everybody else and all I want is for somebody to let him know that what he did was wrong! And if they don't fire him and all you want is the money and the police won't do anything, how is he gonna know he's wrong? You can't take the deal, Abigail! It wasn't so you could get any money, it was because we wanted to get him fired! It doesn't matter about the money! You wouldn't have gotten it before! \nABIGAIL Well it may not matter to you, but where I come from three hundred and fifty thousand dollars is an awful lot of money, and to my mind is a positive result of all this tragedy and not just negative. Not just getting someone fired for one mistake, no matter how bad it was -- \nLISA Oh SHOVE IT UP YOUR ASS! She knocks the speaker phone off the desk and runs to the door in floods of tears. \nDEUTSCH & EMILY Lisa! \nLISA You sleazy fucking lawyer! And you're a moralistic cunt! She runs out. \n168 EXT. STREET. DAY. 168 \nTRACKING in front of Lisa as she walk-runs down the busy street. A city bus appears behind her and goes by. She cranes to see the driver. It's not her guy. She keeps going. \n169 EXT. SCHOOL. DAY. 169 \nLisa stands against a car, smoking, as the kids flow out of the building. Mr Aaron comes out, talking with BONNIE, the gymnastics teacher. They walk away from the school together. Lisa catches up with them. \nBONNIE Hey, Lisa. What's Up? \n- LISA Hey, did you guys know I had an abortion last week? Pause. \nMR AARON No. I didn't know that. \nLISA Yeah, it cost four hundred dollars. \nBONNIE Um, should I... \nMR AARON No, no, don't go anywhere. \nLISA Yeah, don't go anywhere. Bonnie doesn't know what to make of this. Mr Aaron looks steadily at Lisa. \nMR AARON Do you want to tell us about it? \nLISA Yeah. I do. \nMR AARON OK. -Go ahead. \nLISA Well... She doesn't speak. Pause. \nBONNIE Do your parents know about this, Lisa? \n169 CONTINUED: 169 \nLISA Yes. \nBONNIE Have you told the father, honey? \nLISA No...There's a couple of people it could be. \nMR AARON I think you better tell them. Whoever they are. \nLISA No...No...Never mind ...I'm sure he's sorry anyway, whichever one he is. \nMR AARON I don't see what difference that makes, if he's sorry. And I think whoever it is should know about this. \nLISA I'm sorry. I shouldn't have brought this up. Please don't tell anyone. \nBONNIE We're not gonna tell anyone. But you're gonna have to tell whoever it could be -- \nLISA (On have to\") That's OK. I gotta go. Thanks for listening. It's -- It doesn't matter about the father, because the whole thing was my fault. I'm sorry...! She shakes her head and runs away. \nBONNIE What was that...? \n170 INT. COHEN APARTMENT. DAY. 170 \nLisa comes in. Curtis is doing his homework at the table. \nCURTIS Mom's looking for you. \nLISA What for? \nCURTIS She thinks you're going out with her tonight. \n170 CONTINUED: 170 \nLISA Where are we going? \nCURTIS I don't know. Lisa heads for her room. Joan appears, half-dressed. \nJOAN Lisa? Honey? Did you forget we're going to the opera? \nLISA Yes. \nJOAN I didn't-remind you because I didn't want to nag you. \nLISA It's OK. \n171 EXT. BROADWAY -- NEAR LINCOLN CENTER. DUSK. 171 \nLisa starts to cross the street against the light. Joan takes her arm. \nJOAN Don't get run over. A cab rattles by. Lisa looks down the street. A BUS is approaching. \nLISA Wait. I want to see if that's him. \nJOAN What. They wait. The bus gets closer, heading straight toward them and stops at the bus stop. Lisa grabs her mother's arm. \nLISA It is him. Mom, that's the one... Joan and Lisa look at him. He's staring out ahead of him as people board the bus. He SEES Lisa and Joan but can't see their faces and doesn't recognize Lisa: He just sees two dolled-up women under the street light. He smiles dazzling at them and drives past with a short wave. Joan looks at Lisa. She looks like she's about to throw up. \nJOAN Come on. We're gonna miss the curtain. \n172 EXT. METROPOLITAN OPERA -- OUTDOOR TERRACE. NIGHT. 172 \n", "test3_id": 863}

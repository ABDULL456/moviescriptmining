Ted can't help but SNORT at the mention of this familiar phrase as he looks at Tiffany.  Tiffany glares back at him. 
PAUL (sniffling) I guess you're right. 
TIFFANY Now you get tough.  And remember, this call is for entertainment purposes only.  Call me back and let me know how it goes. 
Tiffany hangs up and walks out.  Ted tries to catch her eye and let her know he was just kidding.  He can't.  She goes. 
112   INT. PAUL'S CAR - LATER                                                      112 
Paul behind the wheel, a strange determined look on his face.  He appears be steeling himself for something. 
113   INT. BARNELL MOBILE HOME / MAIN AREA - LATER                                 113 
Paul enters, SLAMMING the door behind him as Raymond looks up from his porno magazine. 
PAUL (blowing by) She's having sex with them. 
And with that, Paul disappears into the back bedroom. 
114   INT. BARNELL MOBILE HOME / BACK BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER                      114 
Paul sits, waiting.  After what seems like forever, Raymond walks in. 
RAYMOND Who's doing what? 
PAUL Margaret.  You know that Stockholm Syndrome thing? 
RAYMOND The movie? 
PAUL When you fall in love with your kidnappers. 
RAYMOND Get the fuck out of here. 
PAUL I went by there.  She was in the bedroom with the big one. (quietly) Not the first time, either. (a flash of panic) With other men, not kidnappers. 
RAYMOND For real? 
PAUL Her therapist.  And some guy she... hardly knew. 
RAYMOND Wow.  Sucks to be you. 
PAUL Shut up. 
Raymond, a momentary flash of anger, sits on the bed beside his brother. Paul does his best not to flinch. 
RAYMOND I always knew she was a fucking tease. 
PAUL Yeah.  Guess you were right. 
RAYMOND Well, you want my opinion... (Paul nods) I don't trust her, Paul.  Never did. 
PAUL You think she'd... really mess things up? 
RAYMOND Only one way to make sure she doesn't. 
PAUL Not sure what you're saying? 
RAYMOND You remember that pooch Mom had?  Crazy little Jack Russel with the bladder infection? 
PAUL Whole basement stank. 
RAYMOND Nothing you can do but put the thing out of it's misery.  And yours. 
PAUL You... You sure, Ray? 
RAYMOND Trust me, Bro'.  Leaky dogs, crazy women.  Two things no man should have to live with. 
As Ray stands to go, Paul nods, his heart ripped apart for any number of reasons. 
115   INT. BANK OFFICE - MORNING                                                   115 
Paul sits in the manager's office, signing forms.  A large BANK GUARD stands nearby.  The reason? One million dollars in hundred dollar bills neatly stacked on the desk. 
116   INT. OUTDOOR CLOTHING STORE - DAY                                            116 
Paul, with his sack of one million dollars at his feet, is calmly trying on new winter coats with a CLERK.  He feels each one, checking the amount of padding.  He finally settles on a red full-length down parka. 
117   INT. "BARNELL GREAT ESCAPES TRAVEL" - LATER                                  117

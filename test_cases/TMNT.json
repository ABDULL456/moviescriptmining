Further up. Arms to match. Rough skin. It wears a shorn HOODED PONCHO. Inside are two white eyes and gritted smiling teeth. The poncho falls to the ground. \nON ATTACKER - It's LEONARDO! Beaten blue bandana blowing in the breeze. Total hero shot. He pulls out a SINGLE KATANA SWORD, poised for battle. Pantera's backed into a corner. \nPANTERA Let's see if a ghost can die, then. Pantera SCREAMS and runs to Leo and starts swinging! At the CLASH of sword and machete, we- \nSMASH CUT TO: \nEXT. JUNGLE VILLAGE - MOMENTS LATER \nThe Boy is still at the Village Clearing. Suddenly - - the sound of the JEEP begins to rumble in the distance! The villagers panic and scatter. VROOM! The Jeep flies out of the jungle and bounce-slows into the FG! Only there is no one driving it... and it still has the stolen food in it. And the stolen medallion dangles from the rear view mirror. \nWOMAN VILLAGER It's a miracle! The village rejoices. The Boy steps aside for a beat, looks back at the Jungle. Something catches his eye. ...a small crouched figure on a tree branch. Barely silhouetted. His white eyes lit in the darkness. One of them WINKS as the boy smiles. \nB \nOY VILLAGER (beaming... softly) The Ghost of the Jungle. \nINT. UNDERGROUND CAVERN - LATER \nLeo leaps into frame. He takes out his katanas and lays them carefully on the ground. He KNEELS, head bowed, eyes closed. \nLEONARDO My training is now complete. The camera lifts away from Leo... and then PLUNGES into the nearby CAVERN. MUSIC begins to swell. Cam travels a few feet until it DIPS TO BLACK, and comes up beginning our- \nOPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE \nE \nT \nINT. MISCELLANEOUS SEWER, OIL AND IRRIGATION PIPES \nThe music is in full tilt as the camera travels through seemingly miles of underground pipes of all types and design. he camera comes to the end of line.

NEW YORK CITY STREET - NIGHT                             9 \nA mouse-level shot of the spectacular city that never sleeps. It's oddly hypnotic. Still. Until... - BAM! A pair of sneakers land barely in front of the camera, tearing off into the distance. \nNYPD #1 (O.S.) \nFREEEZE! STOP OR WE'LL SHOOT! Shoes belong to a panicked MUGGER, early 20's, as THREE NYPD OFFICERS clamor after him. The Mugger is a jackrabbit - hopping newspaper machines, rolling under passing trucks and doing anything he can to avoid arrest. ventually the NYPD peter out. The mugger looks back. Smiles. \nMUGGER Heh, heh... suckers. ON MUGGER - His eyes suddenly go wide as - VROOOOOM! - we see a jet-black tweaked out motorcycle fly over the cops' heads, aiming directly for Mugger! \nMUGGER Whaaa!!! The Mugger runs, but can't escape. The Driver is dressed in all-black motorcycle leathers and black-visored helmet. Scary and faceless. He quickly gains on the Mugger and GRABS him by the collar in mid-stride! \nMUGGER You crazy?! Put me down, man! But Driver doesn't. Instead, he holds him lower without stopping the bike... and proceeds to plow Mugger's head into every trash can and garbage bin along 9th Avenue! \nMUGGER \nOW! HEY! WHAT'RE YOU-OW!! OOF! Just as it looks like he'll hit a telephone pole... Driver veers left! He drags the Mugger into... \nO \nA \nEXT. DEAD END ALLEYWAY - CONTINUOUS \nHEY! NOT BELOW THE-OOOFF!! OW!! End WIDER with the kids all walking away from Mikey, now on the floor doubled over from the \"playing\". A beat, then- -one more kid runs back and kicks Mikey. \nLITTLE GIRL \nKEEEEYA! (turns and walks back) This was the best birthday ever, Mommy! Mikey GROANS as we- \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. UPTOWN APARTMENT - SUNSET/LATER \nBeautiful downtown autumnal street. Parked in front, we see the \"COWABUNGA CARL\" PARTY VAN loudly decorated in kid- friendly colors with an embarrassing and low-tech looking TURTLE HEAD ON TOP. PUSH IN on upstairs apartment window. \nS \nOCCER MOM (O.S.) Thanks so much. You're worth every penny. I have to tell all my friends about you. You'll love their kids too. \nINT. UPTOWN APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS \nMascot Mikey is standing at the door, holding a fistful of cash, still in full costume. \nMICHAELANGELO I can only hope they're as lovely as the rugrats you got here. ON KIDS - They look tough, brandishing their nerf weapons - a toddler street gang. One of the kids does a finger-point-then- throat-slit gesture. The mom looks and beams. The kids quickly smile to cover. \nMICHAELANGELO (through gritted teeth) Such... angels. Mikey looks to the side, and sees the still piled-high stack of PIZZA BOXES through the fake head POV. \nSOCCER MOM Okay! Everyone say good-bye to Cowabunga Carl! BYE! \nMICHAELANGELO (put-on voice) Hyuk! Cowabunga dudes! Bye! \nKIDS \nBYE!!!!!! ON DOOR - As the door closes and Mom turns back, a green hand reaches in quickly a grabs a box of pizza. The door closes. \nMICHAELANGELO (O.S.) Heheh... score. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. UPTOWN APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER \nMikey opens the van's rear doors. He PULLS OFF the fake zipper on his chest and then pulls off his fake turtle head. His trademark orange bandana spills out. He turns, breathing in the fresh surface air. A quiet beat until - A POLICE SIREN approaches, faint, in the distance. Mikey jumps in the van, slams the door shut as the car whizzes by. WIDER - the van takes off down the street. \nDONATELLO (O.S.) Hey, hey, hey... don't forget the face thing. \nEXT. NEW YORK CITY STREETS - LATER \nCLOSE ON - a regular motorist sitting in his car at a traffic light. Don monitors from a small dashboard cam. Man looks OS Left. Reacts. OFF HIS LOOK - We see Mikey beside him in the van. He's behind the wheel - face FROZEN in a goofy SMILE like a ventriloquist to \"hide\" his identity. Don follows on a small surveillance cam under the rearview mirror. \nMICHAELANGELO Yes... sir. \nDONATELLO (O.S.) That's a good boy. \nMICHAELANGELO All's I'm saying Donnie is that no one would notice if YOU did one of these gigs every now and again. \nDONATELLO (O.S.) But you add such... panache to the character. Mikey, emotional, pops into \"fully animated\" facial mode. He rubs his sore neck. \nMICHAELANGELO Well, if panache is French for \"punching bag\", I'd have to agree with ya. \nINT. TURTLES LAIR - MONITOR ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nA darkened room lit only by the lights of dozens of tv's, monitors and TV tubes. Cables run everywhere. In front of them is DONATELLO - our resident tech-head turtle. \nDONATELLO Close enough. I - uh-oh- ON MONITOR - Don watches Mikey through a TRAFFIC CAM in front of the van. Don is jacked into every major security and surveillance camera in the city. \nSPLINTER Ahh! Butter creme frosting! Donatello walks to Splinter. Holds his hand out, judgmental. \nDONATELLO Master. No cake. You remember your last cholesterol tests. \nSPLINTER But I- (changes attitude) -Donatello! I am your Master! \nDONATELLO Nice try, sensei. But you can still be my Master... with low cholesterol. Splinter surrenders the cake. As Don walks away, Michaelangelo reaches into his bag and secretly passes Splinter a smaller wrapped piece. \nSPLINTER He-heh. You have done well, my son. Donatello walks to the fridge and opens it - FILLED with dozens of other pieces of Birthday Cake leftovers. He tosses it with the rest.                                  C \nUT TO: \nEXT. ROOFTOPS - SUNSET \nThe street noise below is barely audible. Camera creeps along the edge of the building, reaching a row of GARGOYLES. AN ALONG GARGOYLES - Still. Concrete. Creepy. Just as we pass the fourth, we barely notice it's WHITE EYES OPENING. QUICK SNAP BACK TO GARGOYLE - Only now it's gone. Something strange is coming to town... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. NEW JERSEY HARBOR - SUNSET \nLarge freighters. Lots of activity. PUSH IN on a steamer as a crane lowers a LARGE VERTICAL CRATE to the dock - it THUMPS down hard. \nAPRIL (O.S.) Careful! That isn't some box full of fish! CAM LOWERS - as APRIL O'NEIL leaps down into frame. Dressed in jungle expedition gear with her head wrapped in a bandana. She takes off her sunglasses and admires the crate. ON BOX - Labelled \"O'Neil Cargo\". Something ominous about the crate. PUSH IN on it as April steps in front. Admires it with pride. Turns, takes out a cell phone, and hits speed dial. ON PHONE DISPLAY - \"Calling HOME\". It rings. \nAPRIL (impatient mutter) Where are you? \nINT. APRIL AND CASEY'S LOFT APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS \nA spacious NYC loft - tons of bookcases work as room dividers. Piled with artifacts, unopened crates of all sizes, boxes of maps, and a general organized mess. A hockey game BLARES from a TV set. CAM PANS ACROSS ROOM - The telephone continues to ring just as we reach the KITCHEN - with piles of dirty dishes and fast food. And then a path of strewn clothes that gets messier and messier until we reach - - CASEY JONES, snoring on a sofa. He finally wakes up, clamors for the phone, tripping over mess in the process. \nC \nASEY \n(GROGGY) Talk to me. \nAPRIL Hey. It's me. I'm back. Casey rubs his face, tries to orient himself. Looks at watch. \nCASEY Was that today, babe? April's disappointed. Same old Casey. \nO \nAPRIL Yes. It was today that I returned to you after being in a deadly jungle for almost a month. \n(BEAT) I thought you were going to meet me down here? \nCASEY I'm sorry, babe. I must've- \nAPRIL Forget it. I'll take a cab. A long pause on the phone. Casey knows he's busted. \nCASEY I missed you? April doesn't answer. She closes the phone. Casey slumps in his chair, shaking his head. \nCASEY Good goin', Case. Back at the dock, April is back to business. \nAPRIL Howie! Get this on the truck for delivery! Let's go! P.O.V. INSIDE BOX - See April through the wood slats. We'd swear we almost hear... LOW GROWLING. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MIKEY'S BEDROOM - LATER \nMikey is on his bed. His thumbs pound away at a video game on TV - bored. He puts down the controller and yells to the ceiling. \nDONATELLO You are such a Neanderthal. Raphael does the bully FAKE LUNGE at Don. Don reacts quick and startled, eyes wide. \nAPHAEL I rest my case. \nS \nPLINTER \n(SCOLDING) Raphael! If bullying is the only way to argue your point, then perhaps you do not have much of a point to begin with. \nAPHAEL (gritted teeth) Yes, sensei. (to Mikey) And quit touchin' my stuff. Raph yanks the Ring Blades out of Mikey's hands and storms out of the room by flipping up a series of cables to the second floor. \nDONATELLO (too-late-retort to Raph) That was just a startle response and isn't really an indication of fear! Raph does the \"blah blah\" hand gesture from above. Enters his room, slams the door and immediately BLASTS MUSIC... ...and it's some annoying pop HIP-HOP song. \nRAPHAEL (O.S.) \nAAAARGH! AND STOP TOUCHING MY \nSTEREO TOO, MIKEY!!! Then HEAVY ROCK starts playing to drown out his family. A silence sits in the room as a CD flies out of Raph's room. Tense in the room for a bit. Don looks at the other two. \nDONATELLO It's an involuntary thing your body does when stimulated like that. (no response) What? It's true. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HARBOR - NIGHT \nA large JET LINER flies into the city. Lowering. The wheels fold out under the carriages. CLOSER - LEO is on the landing gear, his face lit up by the city glow in front of him. He jumps off as - FOOMP! - a HANG- GLIDER opens up from his backpack. He lowers the glider to the water and RELEASES! \nINT. SEWER PIPE - MOMENTS LATER \nDisgusting. Dripping. Out of the slime, Leo rises. A beat... inhales, then SMILES WIDE. \nLEONARDO Mmm... home sweet home. \nINT. TURTLES LAIR - NIGHT \nAll is peaceful in the lair. The big screen TV is the only light source. Mikey snores and drools on the couch, covered in junk food wrappers. Donnie sleeps with an \"TECH HEAD\" magazine over his face... gadget-in-process in his lap. ON ENTRANCE - Leo walks in and places his bag on the floor. The place feels different... but still feels like home. \nS \nHe tiptoes with ninjitsu precision across the floor, avoiding the potential noise-making mess below him. He sneaks to- \nINT. SPLINTER'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nLeo peers in cautiously. Splinter is still awake. Expecting him. Kneeling on the floor. Very serious. \nSPLINTER Enter. Leo walks in and kneels in front of Splinter. \nLEONARDO I have completed my training, master. I am prepared for the next stage. \nSPLINTER That you are, my son. You must now apply all that you have learned on your lengthy journey to your everyday life. THAT will be the most challenging training of all... plinter reaches out and hands Leonardo an ANCIENT MEDALLION. Leo is touched. CLOSE ON SHADOWS OUTSIDE OF ROOM - We see a pair of EYES, watching the entire scene... jealous. \nSPLINTER I've missed you, Leonardo. \nL eo hugs Splinter. \nLEONARDO I've missed you too, father. \nSPLINTER I'm afraid much has changed in your brothers' spirits since you have left. But now that you are home, they will finally have the ethical and warrior leadership they have been lacking. The family needs you. ON LEO - He swallows that big pill very hard. \nLEONARDO Heh. Yeah... I mean, yes sensei. \nWINTERS ASSISTANT The board is waiting. \nWINTERS Excellent. He walks to the large bay windows that overlooks the city. \nEXT. WINTERS OFFICE \nNow outside the window, he smiles at the view. \nWINTERS Tell them I'm on my way down. He slowly LOWERS OUT OF FRAME. CAM PULLS OUT WIDER REVEALING - Winters Office is an \"elevator\" of sorts that can ride up and down the front of the building, allowing him access to any floor of his Tower without leaving his desk. WIDER - see the Tower is a monolith in the middle of Manhattan - complete with it's own front Central Park-ish gated entry. A true work of modern architecture. \nWIPE TO: \nINT. WINTERS LOBBY - DAY \nWe see the wonder of everything Winters - mixing of old artifacts with modern day aesthetic and implementation. The ceilings are vast and there is no mistaking the worth of the man and his company. \nW inters' Elevator Office lowers into a balcony level building overseeing the main lobby. He walks down a stairwell and through the lobby, five Assistants following him. \nINT. BOARDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nWinters walks in the room. CLOSE ON him as he stops at the head of the boardroom table. \nINTERS Gentlemen! Let's begin. \nT \nCAM PULLS BACK along the impossibly long table as DOZENS OF BOARD MEMBERS stand up. When it reaches the end, it looks as though Winters stands at the head of an ARMY AT ATTENTION. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TURTLES LAIR - AFTERNOON \nLeo walks along the upper floor of their lair. As he passes Mikey's room, his brother pops out with his skateboard. We follow them as they walk down to the TV area. \nMICHAELANGELO Leo... what's up, bro? \nLEONARDO Just enjoying being home. hey walk past Donnie's Chop Shop room as - BOOM! - something explodes and smoke pours out under his door. \nDONATELLO (O.S.) \nNOBODY PANIC! I HAVE IT ALL UNDER \nCONTROL! Mikey and Leo COUGH, leave the smokey area. \nLEONARDO Say, what's up with April and Casey? I expected them to drop by after I got back. \nMICHAELANGELO We don't see much of `em anymore. April seems to be working a lot - eww - and Casey seems to be, I dunno, \"different\" lately. Maybe he doesn't like having to put the toilet seat down now that they've moved in together. \nLEONARDO They're living together now? They get to the living room area. Mikey walks to the edge of a jury-rigged HALF-PIPE he built in an old water slough. Mikey continues as he skates back and forth. \nMICHAELANGELO To be honest with ya, they're kinda buzzkills to be around. \nLEONARDO Is Casey at least still doing his hockey mask thing? \nK \nMICHAELANGELO Dunno. Haven't noticed since The Nightwatcher has come home to roost. WOOOOHOOOOOOOO! \nLEONARDO \"Nightwatcher\"? That some new comic book you're hooked on, Mikey? RAPHAEL walks in. Picks up Mikey's scrapbook as he passes the sofa and slugs it in Leo's chest. \nRAPHAEL This should explain most of it. The legacy of the city's newest hero. Compliments of the fanboy over there.    M \nThe doors open in Winters Lobby. April struts in, owning the place. Casey struggles pulling the pallet holding the LARGE CRATE behind them. As she passes reception- \nRECEPTIONIST Mr. Winters. April O'Neil is here. \nINT. WINTERS OFFICE \nHis darkened office is especially alpha-male - BIG GAME HUNT trophies adorn the walls, as do SUITS OF ARMOR from all time periods and random strange ARTIFACTS spanning history in glass cases. Winters sits at his large desk as the large doors open and April and Casey spill in. \nWINTERS Miss O'Neil. You are a vision. Thirty days in a jungle, and beautiful as ever. He shakes her hand and double-cheek kisses her. Casey's eyes widen - is THIS what his girlfriend does? \nAPRIL Hello Max. \n(BEAT) This is my... friend, Casey Jones. \nWINTERS Chris! How's it going? Winters nearly crushes Casey's hand in his grip. \nCASEY Actually, It's Ca- \nWINTERS (ignoring, back to April) So how was your trip? \nAPRIL You know, the typical - corrupt government officials, double crossed by a jungle guide, all ending in a heart-pounding chase. Winters and April chuckle. Cam adjusts to show Casey between them in the bg, looking uncomfortable and out of place. \nAPRIL But it was all worth it. beat - excited) I found it. The fourth General. Winters BEAMS, way too excited as well. April holds out her hand to Casey, who doesn't know what she wants. He awkwardly HIGH FIVES her. \nCASEY Yeah-ha! The fourth General. \nAPRIL (hushed gritted teeth) The crow-bar. \nCASEY Oh. He hands it to April as she twirls up a CROW-BAR and cracks open the front panel. INSIDE BOX POV - The light gradually breaks in, until - CREAK - the front panel falls to the floor. CLOSE ON - Winters' look. Pure wonder and admiration. He walks up to it slowly. April and Casey cautiously stay back. \nWINTERS \n(SOFT) ...the gods be praised. ON BOX - We finally see the statue - GENERAL AGUILA - a seven- foot towering wall of granite and obsidian. Eagle warrior armor reflecting a South American design... though not from a specific time period. Winters rubs his hand over the stone. \nW \nAPRIL Can I ask you a question? \nWINTERS (not looking away) \nY es. Of course. \nAPRIL I've been so grateful for the opportunities you've given me lately. I'd probably be still selling antique curios if you hadn't visited my shop that day. (off of box) But I have to ask... why the fascination with these particular works of art? I'd never even heard of the Legend of Yaotl until we met. He looks up. The cam PANS RIGHT. It travels past an SUIT OF ARMOR in the FG. Goes to BLACK. Continue PAN until we're in- \nEXT. FLASHBACK BATTLEFIELD - 3000 YEARS AGO \n-the armor becomes the back of a HELMET. Camera dollies around the helmet until we're looking at a dark and imposing figure. YAOTL. His helmet is impenetrable, with eye slits. Note - the flashback is dark, shadowed and monochromed. Detail is hinted at instead of shown. Very stylized. \nWINTERS (V.O.) It was a time long before the Mayans, April. Long before the Aztecs and even the Olmecs. It was a time of legends. A time of greatness. The true mother culture of Central America. Cool shots of Yaotl. His armor, his stance, etc. \nINTERS (V.O.) There was a man named Yaotl. More a force of nature than man. And together with his Four Warrior- Priest Generals, they pillaged every culture in their path. QUICK SHOTS OF EACH GENERAL. The walk along side Yoatl. Possibly slo-mo. We will come to recognize them through their distinct armor as the Four Stone Generals - in human form. \nWINTERS (V.O.) And for every culture they destroyed, they drank in all the magic and knowledge known to them. \n(MORE) \nO \nWINTERS(cont'd) They became a warring hurricane, gathering more power and knowledge with each conquest. GROUP SHOT - Of five Warriors. High atop a hillside, finally stopped. Ready for battle. Their character-specific weapons are drawn. Around them is a small army of MINIONS. \nWINTERS (V.O.) Then they came across a culture rich with science, magic and their own technology. A South American version of \"Atlantis\". \nAPRIL Give me strength. \nCUT TO: \nINT. WINTERS OFFICE \nWinters is still alone in his office. Still studying the statue. A beat. He turns his head to the side. \nWINTERS You can come out now. IDER - As we see FOUR FIGURES appear out of the smallest and darkest of shadows! The LEADER slinks forward - clearly a \nS woman - dressed in cloak and Japanese Noh mask over her face. he takes it off, revealing KARAI - the beautiful leader of the Japanese Foot Clan, flanked by three, FOOT NINJAS. \nWINTERS Your talents are commendable. \nKARAI As are yours. Most don't notice us until we decide they will. \nWINTERS Well, I guess I'm just special that way. Winters walks over to his desk. The Statue looms behind them. \nWINTERS So down to business - aside from the other reasons for your visit to America, are you interested in my offer we discussed? \nKARAI I must confess... I still don't know exactly what we are to do for you. \nWINTERS I need the finely-tuned eyes and stealth of your Foot Ninja to... monitor the city for me over the next few days. Winters walks to his window. It's night. Overlooks the city. \nWINTERS Just keep your eyes peeled for anything... strange. \nKARAI (long beat) What kind of strange things? The question hangs as we PUSH IN ON Statue's face... his eerie eyes. We think his eye GLOWS, only we- \nMATCH CUT TO: \nEXT. STAR-FILLED SKY - NIGHT \nThe glowing eye is really a STAR. The same line pattern we saw at movie's open. The stars ADJUST... lining up in a more straight-lined manner. CAM LOWERS, placing us back in- \nEXT. NEW YORK CITY STREETS - NIGHT \nA MAN walks down the sidewalk. As he passes a DARKENED ALLEYWAY, he hears a low GROWL come from it. He stops. ALLEY POV - As the man looks in. Can't see a thing. Hand-held cam. He moves to leave... and the growl comes again. STREET - Man stares in. No one on the street. Looks closer... closer... grows more tense as... \n...WHAM! The requisite CAT jumps out of the shadows. Scares Man half to death. \nMAN \nWAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!! (calms down) Gave me a scare kitty. He pets the kitty a bit, then walks off. CAM LOWERS behind cat, as Man walks off into the distance. Until... ...WHAM! A large burly CLAWED ARM slams out of the shadows onto the cat, yanking it back into the alley! Quick caterwaul. Silence. And then we hear a BURP. \nC AM LOWERS further through the asphalt, then quickly hooks up with an air duct pipe. Zips faster and faster until we're in- \nINT. TURTLES LAIR - TRAINING DOJO \nLeo feverishly works out. He stops, looking up, panting. \nLEONARDO (O.S.) Does ANYBODY train anymore?! \nMICHAELANGELO (O.S.) Just a sec, dude! I'm almost at level eighteen. (OS video game explosion) Scratch that... seventeen. \nLEONARDO \nDONNAY! \nDONATELLO (O.S.) In... uh... a few minutes, Leo. I'm in the middle of- KZZZT-BOOOM! - An OS invention blows up. \nDONATELLO (O.S.) Um... make that another hour. Leo sighs. Splinter walks by, not stopping. \nWIDER - Don and Mikey are already sitting there. \nMICHAELANGELO So nice of you to join us, gentledudes. \nDONATELLO And by the way, I prefer the classic military corner tuck for my bedsheets. \nM ikey and Don high five. Leo and Raph aren't amused. They stare down. Raph does his BULLY FLINCH fake-lunge... only Leo doesn't twitch. Suddenly- \nMICHAELANGELO (O.S.) Whoa! Whawazzat?! The others rush over to the edge with Mikey. \nICHAELANGELO You dudes see that up there? OFF HIS LOOK - We see LARGE SHADOWS moving with in a large I- BEAM CONSTRUCTION SITE. The movement is coming from one of the higher floors. \nMICHAELANGELO So what now, captain? \nLEONARDO We need to come up with a plan. \nRAPHAEL Later! Raph RUNS OFF toward the action. \nLEONARDO \nRAPH!!! But Raph doesn't stop. All three look at each other. Then- \nMICHAELANGELO Welcome home. \nEXT. I-BEAM HIGHRISE CONSTRUCTION \nThe boys cross over on a large CONSTRUCTION CRANE and scale up the few more stories to the top. They stand on a scaffold underneath the floor of the activity. ON WALL - Deep CLAW MARKS are carved into the steel, much like by April and Casey's loft. Don notices. \nDONATELLO Guys, I've got a bad feeling... \nL \nM \nRAPHAEL Ahh, let's take a tiny peek. They scale to the top floor. Peering over the edge. \nMICHAELANGELO Well, there's a good/bad news scenario for ya. CAM BEGINS TO CRANE UP from Turtles to activity on the floor. \nMICHAELANGELO Good news is that there are a buncha Foot Ninja gettin' the snot kicked out of `em. CAM FINISHES ON FLOOR - Showing SIX FOOT NINJAS and KARAI squaring off against a LARGE BIGFOOT-LIKE MONSTER! It tosses them around like stuffed animals. \nICHAELANGELO (O.S.) Bad news is WHAT's kickin' the snot out of `em... ON TURTLES - As they've all now crept up to the dark corner of the floor. A FOOT NINJA gets clobbered and sails past them, and off the building. (safely to a scaffold below) \nD \nONATELLO An interesting conundrum. Do we hold dear the value of life and help the Foot regardless of our tumultuous past? \nMICHAELANGELO I vote for sitting back and enjoying the show. (to Leo) Whaddaya say, leader boy? ON LEO - He's troubled. The burden of \"leader\" shouldered. \nRAPHAEL Nah. We kick butt. Raph jumps forward! Leo rolls his eyes, as all the Turtles jump into the fray. The Foot are surprised at first, and the Bigfoot Monster is confused as well. ON LEO - He stops when he comes face to face with Karai. \nEONARDO Who are YOU?! ON KARAI - She pauses a moment. They exchange expert katana attacks. Stalemate. She gestures to the Foot as they use this opportunity for their escape. As they leap away, Karai looks back at the Turtles... \nR \nThe Creature immediately CHASES the boys throughout the structure, as they use all their ninja skills to avoid it, not to mention impalement on the bed of rebar below! aph tries to turn the tables and attacks the Creature! The boys have no choice but to help him... putting them in deeper trouble. The I-Beam is getting dented and twisted with each impact. The tussle begins to fall - whoomp, whoomp - down many flights of floors. Raph gets separated at one point, jumping off the side of the building to catch up, and swings himself back onto the bottom floor to await the others. SMASH! They fall into Raph's floor. \nRAPHAEL Nice of ya's ta join me. But the Turtles eventually get cornered. And just as the Creature closes in- \nMICHAELANGELO \nYEEEAAAAARGGHHH!!!!! The creature stops. Confused. So are the other three turtles. \nWINTERS Are we... cool? The Foot don't move. Tense. Karai finally nods. Terse. \nWINTERS Ninjas. No sense of humor. (to Generals) So how did we fare? CORRIDOR ENTRANCE - a hunched SHAPE undulating in chains is wheeled into the light. Winters approaches it - chained to a high-tech and uplit pallet on the floor. We can barely make it out as being the HAIRY CREATURE from the I-beam fight. \nWINTERS (close, quiet) So it begins... It SCREAMS. Fights it's restraints. Tires. Breathing heavily. Winters approaches, safely inches away from his fanged maw. Creature suddenly lunges forward! Winters doesn't flinch. He merely grins at the creature. \nWINTERS (to General Aguila) Were there any problems? AGUILA speaks in a gravelly, hardened voice. He towers over Winters by a foot. Clearly the leader of the four. \nGENERAL AGUILA None, my lord. \nWINTERS (to Karai) You see, now THAT'S a good soldier. You two should compare notes. Karai and Aguila stare at each other. Karai obviously not used to being handled like this. \nK \nKARAI Just what is this all about? \nWINTERS Oh, let's call it a scavenger hunt. (re: Generals) I now have the power and know-how, but I need the speed and stealth of an organization such as your own. Not to mention an organization that values discretion. \nKARAI But of course. \nWINTERS You see, I have nine more beasts like this that should be coming to town very soon. Thirteen in all, to be exact. The Four Generals move the monster into a position on the floor ahead - into a DISK on the floor. ON CEILING - We see the top of a CAGE inserted over top, creating a cell. \nARAI But... why? Why here? Why now? \nWINTERS Instinct, mostly. They're animals at their core. (looks off, distant) And they recognize something familiar in the air... in the stars. \n(BEAT) What can I say? I'm a lover of animals. The disk ROTATES. WIDER we see that there are already some cells inserted on the large stone disk in the floor. Filled by darkened silhouettes of creatures that we're probably glad \nW we don't fully see. Glowing eyes pierce out of the darkness. \nINTERS So you go and get to know each other. And don't forget... play nice. The Generals turn and walk-push the Foot out of the door. They move to fight back, but Karai waves her hand. \nKARAI Not now. Our business will be handled at a later time... \nD \nR \nC \nAfter they leave, we pause for A BEAT on Winters. Quiet. Tired. Contemplative. \nUT TO: \nINT. TURTLES LAIR - KITCHEN - AFTERNOON \nThree brothers sit around their breakfast table, looking hung over from the previous night's brawl. Mikey comes in, looking the worst of all, and plops into his seat. Cam circles table. \nMICHAELANGELO Dudes, did anyone get the license plate of the thing that hit us last night? Oi, my head... Don pours over a thick book on MONSTERS AND MYTHOLOGY. \nDONATELLO Was it just me, or did that creature look familiar? \nRAPHAEL We coulda taken it if you slackers woulda pitched in sooner. \nLEONARDO Fact remains, Raph, that we should have never been there in the first place. \nAPHAEL Well, I suppose that we shoulda let Mr. Cuddly-kins continue to spread happiness throughout the city... oh wait... HE WAS A FREAKING MONSTER TRYIN' TA KILL US!!! Good call, fearless leader. \nONATELLO Come to think of it, it WAS pretty strange to see the Foot too. And who was that woman? \nMICHAELANGELO I dunno, but she sure gave Leo a run for his money. \nQUICK SHOTS - Nightwatcher gearing up. ightwatcher emerges from a MAN HOLE. Walks to a long- forgotten and shadowed underside of a BRIDGE. He points up with a REMOTE - chirp! Slowly, his MOTORBIKE begins to lower on retractable grappling hooks. \nO N BIKE - Explodes out of a BACK ALLEY and into the night. \nEXT. NEW YORK CITY BACK ALLEYS/STREETS - NIGHT \nVarious shots of Nightwatcher tearing all over the city. On bike and on foot. Angry. Trying to work it out of his system. He's swallowed it all up to this point... getting harder. \nBEGIN MONSTER HUNTING MONTAGE \nAggressive and driving music. Various shots of the Stone Generals capturing a laundry list of CREATURES that are coming into the city. See the tech, detail and precision that the Winters' operation works. Foot Ninja act as living \"tracking devices\" around the city. - The Generals capture a Sloth-like creature, jumping in throughout rafters above. The Foot try to help by blocking exits. - The Generals capture a werewolf-like creature in the high- speed subway tunnels. The Foot maneuver the subway car. - General Mono takes on a large scale YETI-like monster. A WWE-sized match set in a large abandoned warehouse. - Close calls, as humans come close to seeing the monsters... but rarely do. We see small house pets swiped away. Fleeting glimpses of limbs, claws and teeth in the shadows all over NYC. Meat trucks torn open and their contents \"stolen\". - Intermix quick shots of Generals and collars clamping, cells locking, etc. \n- See more cells being filled in Winters Basement. ONLY 3 \nEMPTY CELLS REMAIN. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. APRIL AND CASEY'S LOFT APARTMENT - NIGHT \nQuiet part of the neighborhood. Their lights are fully on. \nAPRIL (O.S.) You sure you don't want to spar a bit? \nINT. APRIL AND CASEY'S LOFT APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS \nApril is dressed in work-out gear on a grouping of floor mats. She twirls a wooden KATANA as part of a floor routine. Wow - she's actually pretty good! Casey eats a bag of chips with one hand, does curls with a dumbbell with the other. \nCASEY Nah. Ever since you started with the blade weapons you, um... you kinda scare me. \nAPRIL Suit yourself. (she stops - a beat) Case? \nCASEY Yeah? \nAPRIL \n(AWKWARD) Are you happy? I mean, with your life. With me. Casey pauses a beat. Tries to be upbeat. \nCASEY Yeah. Sure. (beat - serious) You? April thinks just as much. \nAPRIL Yeah. They sit on that for a moment. Casey leans in for a kiss. April doesn't notice. Awkward. Casey changes his mind. \nCASEY (walks to the window) I'm going outside for some air. \nN \nN \nCasey slips out onto the fire escape. April knows better. \nAPRIL (to herself) Be safe. \nEXT. LOFT ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS \nCasey climbs up from the fire escape. Checks to make sure he's alone. He reaches inside a chimney flue and pulls out - A BASEBALL BAT and his CLASSIC WHITE HOCKEY MASK! He slips it on. Does a few warm up swings. Cricks his neck. \nEXT. NYC ROOFTOPS - CONTINUOUS \nAll is still, until the panicked face of a BURGLAR enters frame. Being held by his collar. \nBURGLAR \nLEONARDO Do bad guys still try to do that? \nDONATELLO Yes, however they're usually mortgage re-fi companies. \n(THEN) What about it, April? You just finished working with the guy, right? Does it make sense? \nAPRIL Guys! It's a legend! \nR \nMICHAELANGELO Is that \"legend\" like the ginormous freakin' hairball that attacked us? \nAPHAEL Or \"legend\" like the moving statues and flying creature that attacked me n' Casey? \nAPRIL Okay. Fine. I'll help for now... until we prove you're all insane. \nLEONARDO Or until we prove Winters is up to something more than collecting art. \nDONATELLO I'll work with April and see if these Stars of Kikin she told us about can give us any clues. \nRAPHAEL I say we just storm the castle and face this jerk in person! \nLEONARDO Raph, that would be the worst idea yet. We hang back. Analyze. Formulate a plan, THEN storm your castle. Are we clear? Tense stare off between Raph and Leo. Raph moves anyway. Casey stops him. Quieter moment. \nCASEY Raph. Don't do it, man. \n(BEAT) I spent my whole life running out of rooms ticked off at the world. I wish I could take most of `em back. Sometimes, just takin' a breather is the best thing to do. ON APRIL - She's listening to Casey... maybe her man-boy is growing up. Raph knows he can't win. \nRAPHAEL Yeah... whatever. - and bolts out the door. \nCUT TO: \nA \nINT. SEWERS - MOMENTS LATER \nCam is moving fast... really fast down the pipes. Raph EXPLODES into frame, running faster than us. He lifts up a BACK PACK... He pulls it open, revealing his Night gear. - as he grabs an overhead PIPE and flips up and outta sight. \nEXT. STAR-FILLED SKY - NIGHT \nWe see the same stars we've been tracking move closer into alignment... only now it means so much more to us. CAM LOWERS, as we find ourselves- \nINT. TURTLES LAIR - EVENING \nDonnie looks through a thick book on ASTRONOMY. \nPRIL (O.S.) Think this is all of them, Donnie. ON DOOR - April walks in, holding a 3-foot-high stack of yellowed documents. \nAPRIL I cleaned out my archives on ancient South America. Might have found something useful. She takes out a hand-drawn map. \nAPRIL A map of the stars, as recorded by an Aztec Shaman. They pinpoint the location of the Stars of Kikin... even though the names changed. \nDONATELLO For use in an Aztec calendar. (picks up map) So, if we can cross-reference our current star field, positioning of the Stars of Kikin and backtrack positioning based off of the Aztec \nCALENDAR- \nAPRIL -along with taking into account the point of origin of the first occurrence, we should know where another portal could take place. (to herself) Max, what are you up to? \nLeo paces back and forth in the main area. Splinter walks in. Mikey plays video games on the main TV. \nSPLINTER Leonardo, time cannot be moved faster by wearing a groove in our floor. \nEXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT \nNightwatcher runs along the rooftops. He pauses. He lifts his visor to feel the night air on his face. He sees WINTERS TOWER in the distance... practically egging him on. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. PETE'S DINER - CONTINUOUS \nClassic Diner design, Pete's Diner is closed for the evening. The last light goes out. \nINT. PETE'S DINER - CONTINUOUS \nA greasy DINER COOK finishes cleaning up the tables. He suddenly hears a noise in the back. Big CLANK. KITCHEN - He walks to the back. He hears the noise... now from inside the WALK-IN FREEZER. He slowly approaches it. ANOTHER NOISE. He moves to open INSIDE OF FREEZER - the door slowly opens. The man's face peers in. His eyes go WIDE. He SCREAMS!!! \nEXT. ROOFTOPS - CONTINUOUS \nNightwatcher hears the scream. Runs to the source and looks down at Pete's Diner. Sees the commotion inside. Uses his bolo chain and a power cable to form a ZIP LINE down the street as- \nINT. PETE'S DINER - MOMENTS LATER \n-KERSMASH! He goes through the front window! He stands, cat- like. Ready for anything. The room is only lit by the neon signage behind the counter. Suddenly - Night creeps to the freezer. He can hear the CHEWING and the SNARLING behind the thick door. He takes out a spiked brass- knuckle. Ready. Places a hand on the door... and opens it. ON DOORWAY - The creature is huddled over a pile of frozen meat. Chewing with pieces flying everywhere. Disgusting. It turns around - monkey-like and ferocious looking DEMON... but \"cute\" in a bizarre kinda way. Music builds as go- WIDER ON SIDE VIEW - Night stands there. The horrible demon creature suddenly jumps out of the freezer too! Face off with Raph as we realize- -it's only THREE FEET TALL! \nNIGHTWATCHER Hey there little fella. All that commotion for just little ole y- The Demon SCREAMS! It jumps Night, slamming him to the floor behind a row of tables! \nNIGHTWATCHER (O.S.) \nWAHH! OOOF! AAAGGH! OW!! WHOAAA!!! Plates, glasses and utensils fly everywhere, smashing all over the diner as the Demon pummels him. CLOSE ON NIGHT - The Demon is jumping up and down, slamming his helmeted head repeatedly to the floor! It lunges forward, mouth open as Night backhands it with a PLATE. The Demon jumps back and up, landing on a rotating CEILING FAN. \nT he creature lunges down again, but this time, Night is ready. He fights back. Like fighting with a Chihuahua hopped up on cocaine. A break in the fight. The creature has disappeared. Night knows he's there. He preps. Grabs his SMOKE PELLETS from his pocket. And waits... until... ...the Demon swoops in for another attack! Mouth open, fangs bared as Night tosses the smoke pellets inside! WIDE - POOOMPH! POOOMPH! POOOMPH! The pellets explode in its mouth, sending smoke shooting out of it's nostrils, ears and eyes! It shrieks, flying out of the Diner! \nA \nNIGHTWATCHER (victory taunting) Yeah! That's what I thought! Don't mess with the Nightwatcher! Night turns. His helmet is still on. He hits his LIGHTS on the side of his head to see through the thick smoke. He finds the DINER COOK huddled behind the counter. Night looks scary. \nDINER COOK Pl-pl-please don't hurt me! \nNIGHTWATCHER Whattaya talkin' about? I JUST \nSAVED YOU! \nDINER COOK Please, sir. I have kids. Night looks around. He sees the CASH REGISTER on the floor. He picks it up, puts it on the counter. \nNIGHTWATCHER There ya go, pal. Make sure this is safe. HEY - YOU HEARIN' ME? \nDINER COOK \nTAKE IT! JUST TAKE IT! DON'T HURT \nME, PLEASE! \nNIGHTWATCHER \nLISTEN! I DON'T WANT YER FRIGGIN' \nCASH! WHY DOES EVERYONE HAVE SUCH A \nHARD TIME BELIEVIN' I'M A GOOD GUY? (points threatening) \nI JUST SAVED YOUR STINKIN' LIFE! Sudddenly - SHINK! - a THROWING STAR is lodged in the cash register till! Night jumps. Looks out the window. CAM PULLS WAY WAY BACK, REALLY FAST - Out the Diner and to the rooftop across the street... and over the green shoulders of LEO. ll he sees is a panicked man and the large shape of Nightwatcher standing over him, holding the register. CLOSE ON LEO - He's fuming. Staring down at Nightwatcher. The frustration of the last few days pent up inside of him. \nB ACK IN DINER - Night slowly lays down the register. Trying to figure out his next move. \nIn another part of the city, the Generals have caught the Demon from Pete's Diner. As they carry him to the caravan, their RADIO COMM goes off. \nKARAI (O.S.) The Foot report of strange activity five blocks north of your location. \nGENERAL SERPIENTE The final creature. \nEXT. ROOFTOP DEAD END - CONTINUOUS \nCamera RISES UP until we reach the rooftop where Leo and Raph continue to duke it out in the rain. They battle. In the end, Raph becomes an uncontrollable ball of anger, unleashing everything on Leo. \nR \nIt ends with Raph pinning Leo to the ground... holding a sai \nMILLIMETERS FROM HIS EYEBALL! Tense. Raph shakes. He looks like he's going to do it... then stops. He collapses back. Almost ashamed of what he's done. Leo just can't believe that Raph bested him. They pant heavily. The rain dies down. Raph RUNS AWAY, across a few rooftops. Away from his brother. He suddenly STOPS and looks back at Leo, small in the distance. CLOSE ON LEO - A SHADOW suddenly falls over him. He looks up to see the FOUR GENERALS surrounding him. He tries to fight back... but is too wiped from Raph. GATO POV - \"reading\" Leo on the ground. He frowns. \nGENERAL GATO It is neither monster nor human. CLOSE ON AGUILA - He manages a small smile. \nGENERAL AGUILA Then he shall perfectly serve our purposes... let us inform our commander that the final creature has been captured. ON RAPH - He sees the commotion from afar... as Leo gets TRANQUILIZED with the Generals' dart cannon. \nRAPHAEL \nLEO!!! Raph runs closer as the Generals lower to the ground and drive off. Raph jumps from rooftop to rooftop to try and catch his brother. \nRAPHAEL \nL eo!!! Hang on!! But the Caravan is too fast, and eventually loses Raph. \nAPHAEL \nNOOOOOOOO!!!! Raph gets weak and collapses to his knees on the roof. The sun begins to rise. He has to return to the sewer. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TURTLES LAIR - MORNING \nApril and Don are poring over books at the kitchen. Mikey paces behind them. Raph storms in, barrels past them all. \nS \nINT. TURTLES LAIR - TRAINING DOJO \nRaphael walks to Splinter, practicing himself in the dojo. Raph holds his Sais in one hand, his bolo chain in the other. Clenches both tight. \nSPLINTER Raphael? What is the matter? \nRAPHAEL \n(RANTING) I was out, and did... something... something happened and I- ARRRGH!!! Raphael picks up a HEAVY WEIGHT and hurls is across the dojo. Splinter is unfazed, but he won't take any more. \nSPLINTER Raphael! Kneel. Raph stops. Breathing heavy. Falls in line - walking to Splinter and dropping to his knees in front of his father. \nRAPHAEL I did something... I did something really stupid, Master Splinter. \nSPLINTER Go on... \nRAPHAEL \n(SEMI-RAMBLING) I know why you chose him now. I know that there's a reason why he's the better son and I'm not. \n(THINKS) And I think I made things worse tonight. (beat - calming down) A WHOLE lot worse... I know you must be ashamed of me, father. Raphael is lost in his guilt. Splinter kneels in front of Raph. \nAPRIL (models it) Picked it up on my last trip to Japan. You... like it? \nCASEY Oh... oh yeah. They share the moment. Seeing what they forgot about each other when they first met. It's enough for them to smile. \nAPRIL Where's your mask? \nM \nE \nCASEY (faking confusion) Mask? What mask? April runs into the other room and comes back with her hands behind her back. She takes out a NEW MASK for Casey - cool, crisp and a badass paintjob. \nCASEY No way... \nAPRIL I was saving it for our anniversary. \nCASEY \n(BEAT) Thanks. Almost awkward as Casey leans forward and is about to kiss her... Then a MUSICAL TUNE (first bar of the TMNT series) plays on a car horn outside, interrupting them again. \nAPRIL That's our ride. \nINT. VEHICLE - NIGHT \nCAM PULLS BACK from the back seat. Everyone is in \"the zone\". Splinter and Don sit in the back seat. Pulling further toward the front, we see April and Casey. nd on Raph in passenger seat and Mikey driving. \nRAPHAEL You know I ain't much on speeches. \n(BEAT) But we can do this. Leo, or no Leo. (looks around) Not because of our individual strengths... but because of how we function as a team. \nICHAELANGELO I love you man. \nRAPHAEL Don't push it. (to April) April, this is going to be dangerous. You sure you're in? \nAPRIL I feel responsible, fellas. I found the Generals for him. \nO \nCAM CONTINUES TO PULL OUT - as the familiar jingle of Cowabunga Carl fades in and we see the Cowabunga Carl Party \nR Van in full view. \nAPHAEL (O.S.) Nice an' incognito there, Mikey. \nMICHAELANGELO (O.S.) Well, I didn't see you offering any suggestions... besides- (imitates Splinter) - a true ninja can hide in plain sight, my son! \nSPLINTER (O.S.) I heard that! Van takes off as the CAMERA SLOWS in the street, watching it drive away. NYC civilians point to the sky, worried. PUSH IN on a TV/STEREO STORE WINDOW - Simon's Electronics. ON TV - Broadcasting a news report. Weather alert. Black clouds brew over head. \nBUBBLY WEATHER REPORTER (O.C.) Scientists are calling it the fiercest storm of the new millennium, with Dopler Radar readings coming in off the charts. Authorities are imposing a curfew to avoid possible civilian harm. Stay tuned for more in minutes. FURTHER DOWN THE STREET - We see Winters Tower and the darkest clouds of all beginning to collect overhead. \nINT. WINTERS LOBBY \nWinters stands with Four Generals in his office, overseeing the portal. Ready. \nINT. WINTERS GARDEN - MOMENTS LATER \nKarai walks down the center path of the garden, flanked by a DOZEN FOOT NINJA. She motions for them to take position. \nKARAI As ordered - no one gets in. No one interferes. No one bears witness. SUDDENLY - the security alarm from the front gate BUZZES. Karai waits a beat. It buzzes again. She walks to the SECURITY PANEL by the front gate. N MONITOR - We see CASEY standing there, obscured by a LARGE WOODEN CRATE IN FRONT OF HIM. Karai coldly opens the gate. \nC \nINT. WINTERS LOBBY \nOur six Heroes all tear into the lobby. They turn back, an army of ninjas closing in on them! \nMICHAELANGELO What do we do, dudes?! \nDONATELLO I'm working on it. Raph grips his sais with renewed strength. Casey looks around, putting things together mentally. Tension builds! \nRAPHAEL We get ready for round two. ON CASEY IN CORNER - He reaches into his back, takes out a hockey stick and - SMASH!!! - kills a LOBBY VASE. Suddenly, sirens blare as the OUTSIDE BUILDING SECURITY SHUTTERS SLAM DOWN just like in Act I! The Ninjas are locked out! \nRAPHAEL Yeah! Everyone high fives Casey. Except April. She smiles. \nAPRIL Nice work, Jones. \nCASEY I have my moments... \nDONATELLO Look! OFF DON'S LOOK - the mayhem builds at the other end of the vast lobby. The cells are glowing. The portal worsens. \nDONATELLO And that would be the swirling vortex to another world, I assume. \n(BEAT) Cool. They all run over. Mikey runs to a cell. \nMICHAELANGELO Leo! Is that you? RAARRGH! - A claw swoops out. He dodges out of the way. \nMICHAELANGELO I guess that would be a \"no\". ON RAPH - He finds Leo! \nDONATELLO Out of the way, please. \nD on places a small EXPLOSIVE on a key lock. Raph pulls Leo out. LIFELESS. \nRAPHAEL Hey buddy! Come on, man. Leo, please wake up! Raph holds Leo in his lap on the floor. Looks like Leo is DEAD. Raph's head falls low, as... \nLEONARDO (O.S.) Wh-wh-what took you s-so long? WIDER - Leo is alive. Coughs and slowly gets his strength back. Stands up. He and Raph look at each other. Leo can only imagine what Raph's been through to rescue him. A beat. \nRAPHAEL Listen, I - I'm sorry. \nLeo forgives him. Moment is suddenly broken by an OS \nSMASH!!!! ANGLE UP - As WINTERS is thrown out the window of his elevator office! He heads straight for a sword wielding BRONZE STATUE... particularly the sword part. Closer... closer... and... ..just misses it. WHUMP! He crashes onto the floor. \nMOTIONLESS. ON GROUP - They just stare at him. Back up to the office, nearly 150 feet above them. ON BALCONY ABOVE - Aguila looks down. Snarls. \nINT. WINTERS LOBBY \nWinters' body still lays on the floor. This is bad. \nCASEY Is he... is he dead? Mikey takes out a hockey stick from Casey's bag and pokes Winters' limp body. Nothing. \nMICHAELANGELO Yup. He's WAY dead, dude. WINTERS GASPS FOR AIR! Startles everyone in the room. ON EVERYONE - Their faces all drop as Winters stands up in his mini-crater, brushes himself off and is perfectly fine! Winters' mind is racing a mile a minute. Doesn't even notice those around him. \nWINTERS \n(GROANS) Raph can't take it any more. He draws his sais and thrusts them at Winters. THAT gets his attention. Winters looks up in awe at seeing the mutated freaks in front of him. \nWINTERS Fascinating... \nSPLINTER Mister Winters. We mean you no harm. \nRAPHAEL No harm?! Whatever! I'm about to give you piercin's in places you never imagined if you don't tell us what's going on. \nO \nGENERAL AGUILA \nNO! YOU WERE WRONG. \nBEAT) And you are weak. \nGENERAL AGUILA (to Karai) Destroy them. Karai sees Winters' condition. Clearly getting screwed by the very beings who have been nothing but hostile toward her and her Foot Clan. She suddenly GESTURES WITH HER HANDS - military/ninja style. \nAPRIL What does THAT mean? \nKARAI It means we're going to help you. WIDER - 40 Foot Ninja disperse around out of the building, leaving Karai and 4 Foot Ninja behind. \nKARAI My soldiers will find the thirteenth monster. And you will bring it back here. Hurry - we don't have much time. Karai runs off. April looks over at Winters. He nods, still hurting. April takes off after Karai, leaving Casey behind with the Four Foot. They run out into the garden, just in time to see the other Foot disappear into the night. \nCASEY I got shotgun! BACK ON GENERALS - They move toward Winters! The Turtles quickly look at one another. Know what they have to do. They all leap in the way, standing between Winters and his backstabbing Generals. Aguila moves forward to Leo. Raph steps in beside him, defiant. Then Mikey. Then Don. \nRAPHAEL If you mess with one of us- (looks around) -you mess with all of us. Aguila smiles at their chutzpa. \nGENERAL AGUILA Challenge accepted. 97   The Portal worsens behind them. Sound and sight. The Eight 97 are ready to fight. ...and the fight BEGINS! The Turtles leap, pounce and strike with all the exuberance and intensity they've ever had. Winters moves to help the Turtles. Suddenly a WALKING STICK across his chest stops him! \nSPLINTER They must face them alone. As brothers. Winters debates it in his head for a beat - WHAM! - a tentacle from the portal slams down next to him! \nWINTERS Alright. We have more important things to do! ON PORTAL - A small DEMON makes its way out of the portal! Winters runs and flips through the air and then CLOBBERS IT with his bare hands, sending it back down! He lands on the other side. \nWINTERS Help me push the cells into the portal! Splinter does as the two masters also manage to lay some smackdown on any emerging creature out of the portal. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. NEW YORK CITY STREETS \nCASEY (O.S.) This has got to be the suckiest vehicle to save the world with. - as the Cowabunga Carl van roars around the corner. Tinkling musical notes chime along with the speed. Appropriately lame and embarrassing. INSIDE VAN - Casey drives, as April, Karai and Four Foot are crammed in the back. Awkward silence. \nCASEY So... anybody from out of town? \nW \nE BEGIN TO INTERCUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE LOBBY FIGHT, \nAND CASEY/APRIL MONSTER CHASE... LOBBY - The combatants all pair off for their final battle. Utter commotion. Mikey is paired with Serpiente. Donnie is paired with the General Mono. He uses his quick speed and expert staff against the hammer-weilding Statue. Leo fights with Gato. He can't dodge him. He's too fast. Leo lands a lucky blow, but Gato recoils - BOOM! Leo's knocked shell-first into a large GLASS DISPLAY CASE filled with swords and bladed weapons of all kinds. \nLEONARDO Come to daddy. MOMENTS LATER - SMASH! - Leo steps out, ready for action. Strapped with a dozen swords tucked all over his body. He pulls them out randomly as needed throughout the fight. \nC \nC \nRaph and Aguila duke it out in and around the MONSTER CELLS. It's a Jackie Chan-inspired sequence, where they have to be aware of their environment to avoid defeat. \nRAPHAEL Sensei! How you guys doing?! ON SPLINTER AND WINTERS - The portal is pulling the cells in. About five more to go. Splinter also flips around and takes out another demon trying to escape. Splinter actually seems to be having FUN. \nSPLINTER Wonderful, my son. WONDERFUL! BACK WITH APRIL AND CASEY - Rush the streets of NYC. \nKARAI My troops have located the final monster. At the harbor docks. \nASEY Oh, I got this one covered. Casey GUNS IT for the pier, music tinkling. CAM ZOOMS AHEAD THROUGH THE STREETS until it reaches the pier. CAM CRANES over the harbor warehouses until we see - - the 13th monster! Looks like a land-locked GIANT CROCODILE. It appears unconscious - a hundred or so TRANQ DARTS sticking out of it's back. The Van pulls onto the scene. \nI NSIDE THE VAN - Everyone is in shock. The ninjas look at each other. \nASEY Huh. Now there's somethin' you don't see every day... They pile out of the van. \nCASEY (off of monster) Well, I guess we have to figure out how to get handsome here back to Winters' Tower. \nWINTERS \nLOOK OUT! Winters dives in and pushes the Turtles out of way as the Creature flies in and knocks the Generals back into the Portal! The Cloud Tendrils grab a hold of it and pull it back into the Portal! ON STARS - The Stars move out of alignment, ending the cycle. ON PORTAL - It begins to close. The Generals struggle to get out, only now, we see they are HUMAN... their curse broken... and an eternity of pain and suffering ahead of them. \nAguila tries to fight his way out of the portal. \nGENERAL AGUILA \nYOU CANNOT DEFEAT US! WE- WHAM! - Raph and Leo team-roundhouse him back into oblivion! \nRAPHAEL I thought he'd never shut up. WIDER - The portal EXPLODES in a upwards funnel. Silence. \nMICHAELANGELO \nHOLY CRAP!!! \nRAPHAEL \nWE DID IT! \nTURTLES \nYEAH! WHOOHOO! WE DID IT! The brothers high five one another. Splinter smiles proud. ON VAN - Dusty and smoking. The door clangs open. Casey piles out. Karai comes next and accidentally FALLS on Casey in a very compromising position! She slyly smiles. April falls out last beside them. \nCASEY (caught - looks at both) Oh. I, uh - HUHN! - Casey tosses Karai off of him. April's eye cocks. \nAPRIL Don't try to tell me for one second that you didn't enjoy tha- Casey just grabs her, cutting her off and they kiss. Like they should have been kissing all along. They stop. Noses close. Smile. They pull apart, revealing MIKEY standing there. Watching them all gooey-eyed. \nMICHAELANGELO \nAWWWWWW.... Raph and Leo look at each other. A beat. Then hug. Brothers again. Dialogue would just ruin this moment. Splinter walks over to them. CAM ADJUSTS to show Karai and the Foot Ninja standing there. Silence. Finally, Karai steps forward - \nKARAI You are every bit the warriors I was informed you were. You have passed. \nON TMNT - they're confused. \nLEONARDO Passed what? \nRAPHAEL You know us? \nKARAI I've known OF you for some time. (beat, to Leo's question) Savor your victory tonight. For soon we will have further business together. \nSPLINTER What kind of business? \nKARAI The kind that involves familiar faces from your past... ON TURTLES - They all look at each other. \nRAPHAEL She doesn't mean... They look back - and see Karai and the Foot have DISAPPEARED. Raph looks over at WINTERS. He's hunched over in the corner. Can't tell what's going on. They walk over slowly. \nRAPHAEL Winters? ON WINTERS - Looks like he's sobbing. They get concerned. Then the sobs turn to LAUGHING. He stands up. His hand is spotted red with his M own BLOOD from a cut on his cheek. \nICHAELANGELO I'm never usually that happy to be bleeding. \nDONATELLO You would be if you were an immortal who couldn't bleed for three thousand years... Winters looks at all the Turtles. \nWINTERS Thank you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. You've made a very old man, very very happy. \nMICHAELANGELO So, um, what happens now? \nR \nC \n", "test1_input": "TMNT \nWritten by \nKevin Munroe \nCreated by \nKevin Eastman & Peter Laird \nFirst Draft Polish August 5, 2005 \nFADE IN: \nEXT.

A bottom-heavy disgusting pig of a man walks up between them. Pantera leans down, face to face with her. \nPANTERA We appreciate the generous donation for the continued protection of your village. ANGLE ON - Their jeep, overflowing with the Village's precious crops. WIDER - A tiny group (10) of other villagers stand at a safe distance. The Woman's HUSBAND runs forward. He immediately LUNGES at Pantera, just as- -SHIKA-SHIKA - Pantera is flanked by 3 MACHINE GUNS pointed at the Husband's chest. Pantera slothfully grins. He leans forward and yanks an HEIRLOOM NECKLACE from her neck. \nPANTERA After all, the jungle can be a very dangerous place. BAH-HAHAHAHA. They jump into the Jeep and tear into the jungle LAUGHING. \nEXT. JUNGLE ROAD - MOMENTS LATER \nThe jeep clamors down the bumpy makeshift path. Pantera sits in the passenger seat as the others are crammed in around the food. The Jungle looms ominous around them. \nH IGH ANGLE - As we watch the jeep from the jungle ceiling high above... as if from someone's POV. ON DRIVER - He suddenly reacts to a fallen tree on the road ahead. Slams on the brakes. Pantera is thrown around. \nPANTERA Idiota! Watch where you're going! \n", "test1_true": "PANTERA Well, what are you waiting for?! \nREMOVE IT! (to soldiers behind) Cortez! Andelay! \nB \nJ \nCORTEZ leaps out. Grabs the winch from the front of the jeep and pulls it to the log, roughly 15 feet away. EEP POV - Pantera and Driver barely notice the out-of-focus bg Cortez get suddenly YANKED out of scene! \nCORTEZ (O.S.) ...yirk! ON DRIVER - His eyes go wide. Trying to see in the dark. \nDRIVER SOLIDER (softly, nervous) D-d-dios mio. ON LOG - Cortez is gone. Pantera wakes up. \nPANTERA What?! WHAT IS IT?! OS - Hear the sound of a CHAIN clinking. Then WHOOSHING as the chain winch suddenly FLIES IN, and CRACKS the BURLY SOLDIER across the jaw! It wraps itself around his neck. Before he can react... - YOINK! He gets pulled over the hood of the jeep, landing on the ground HARD. \nURLY SOLDIER \nOOF! Burly gets pulled backward... away from the Jeep and into... the darkness. He SCREAMS the entire way, clawing the ground. ON JEEP - Driver is freaking out now. Last Soldier is in the back. Pantera stands up in the jeep. \"Last\" jumps out and readies his machine gun. \nPANTERA (to Jungle) \nWHO ARE YOU?! SHOW YOURSELF!! \nDRIVER SOLIDER \n(WHISPER) ...The Ghost of the Jungle. \nPANTERA What?! \nDRIVER SOLDIER \nshaking/nervous) The jungle god that punishes those who prey upon the weak. (looks scared to Pantera) He's coming... for us. \nO \nP \nI \nOS NOISE - Suddenly hear the whooshing of 4 quick punches, kicks, a short machine gun burst and a WHUMP. Pantera and Driver look to the ground. ON GROUND - Last Soldier lays beaten on the jungle floor. \nDRIVER SOLIDER I'm sorry, senor. Driver bounds out of the Jeep and runs SCREAMING into the jungle. CAM PULLS BACK with him as Pantera shrinks in bg. \nPANTERA \nCOWARD!! GET BACK HERE!! Something suddenly skitters behind Pantera! He turns to look. Nothing. He reaches down and pulls up... a MACHETE. \nPANTERA \nSHOW YOURSELF! DO YOU REALIZE WHO \nYOU'RE DEALING WITH?! ON PANTERA - He circles backs against the Jungle wall, trying to find him. Tense. Suddenly- -a PAIR OF WHITE EYES open in the blackness behind him! n a quick series of shots we see Pantera getting the raw end of a flurry of fist and foot attacks. His attacker is moving way too fast for the camera to keep up. Pantera falls back, panting heavily. Panicked. He tears off into the dense Jungle! ON PANTERA RUNNING THROUGH JUNGLE - Thick foliage. Panicked. \nEXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - CONTINUOUS \nAn oasis of calm, violated by this sweating, machete- clutching brute. He stumbles, then stands in the middle. \nANTERA I am not afraid of a myth! (eyes darting) \n", "test2_input": "RAPHAEL Yer tellin' me... Casey looks at his old bud. \nCASEY Raph? \nRAPHAEL Yeah? \nCASEY Nice to see ya, man. Raph acknowledges. The moment is broken by a HORRIBLE SHRIEK! \nCASEY/RAPHAEL What was that?! They both spring to their feet and run to the back of the roof. They hear the scream AGAIN off in the distance. \nRAPHAEL For old time's sake? \nCASEY What the shell. ON RAPH - He stops, mid-replacement of his helmet. \nRAPHAEL \n(DISAPPROVING) Bro. Seriously. \nEXT. ROOFTOPS \nThe two run and leap across the rooftops. Two vigilantes searching for the source of the scream. They finally reach a point where they don't hear it anymore. EDGE OF ROOFTOP - They look out. Silent. \nCASEY I think we lost it. \nRAPHAEL It's gotta be around here somewhere. SCREEEEECH!!! - A large VAMPIRE-LIKE CREATURE flies up from the alley below and spreads its 30-foot wings! \nCASEY/RAPHAEL \nWAAAAAAAAAAAGGGHHHH!!!!!!!! It's about to attack when - THUNKA-THUNKA-THUNKA - it's drilled with TRANQUILIZER DARTS from below! CHOOOM! - A grappling hook winds around its feet. The Creature struggles but is pulled down hard! \nCASEY \nWHAT'S GOIN' ON, RAPH?! \nRAPHAEL Did I mention we ran into a monster last week? \nCASEY \nNO. NO, YOU KINDA FAILED TO TELL ME \nABOUT THAT ONE, BUDDY! They inch closer to the edge. Peek over. ON ALLEY - See the Four Generals putting a pounding on the Creature. They subdue it with all their hardware. The Foot stand guard, helping in the BG. \nCASEY The freakin' FOOT?! (looks to Generals) What about the walking statues? Were you going to mention THOSE?! \nRAPHAEL Nope. Those are a first for me too. (gets cocky) We can take `em. One of the generals effortlessly picks up a TRASH DUMPSTER and wallops the Creature with one blow. \nCASEY On second thought... The Generals put the Creature in a cell. Wheel it to a TRANSPORTER VEHICLE as it drives away. They're just about to leave when- \nS HINK! - Casey accidentally knocks a tiny piece of rock from the ledge. It falls down - CLANG! - on a garbage can lid. \nR \nG \nON GENERALS - they turn around. Look up. GENERAL GATO POV - He scans the two. Organic Earth-based. \nENERAL GATO Witnesses. Aguila snarls and fires the tranq gun! Raph dives in front of Casey, taking the hit himself! \nAPHAEL \nAAAARRGGH!!!!! \n", "test2_true": "CASEY Not good. Raph takes out NINJA SMOKE PELLETS and throws them on the roof - FWOOM! When the smoke clears, Casey is standing there alone! Raph is 10 feet away as Casey flinches and takes off too. \nNIGHTWATCHER You ever heard of smoke pellets? \nCASEY Hey - you're the ninja, not me! BOOM! - Gato lands up on the roof and quickly gives chase! They can't lose him, even when they drop to street level. \nEXT. NEW YORK CITY STREETS - MOMENTS LATER \nRaph and Casey are tearing ass through the alleyways, trying to escape the thing that's close on their tail. \nCASEY \nWHAT WERE THOSE THINGS, RAPH?! Raph ignores him, looking for a street sign. Then he sees it - 56th Street. \nRAPHAEL Bingo. Raphael quickly dashes left through TRAFFIC! DOWN ALLEY BEHIND THEM - BOOM BOOM BOOM - We see Gato bounding down the wall, almost in a four-legged run, occasionally jumping off walls at incredible speeds! A true jaguar. It leaps through the traffic as well. \nC \nUNDER A BRIDGE - Raph points up and - CHOOP! - hits a remote that lowers his MOTORCYCLE. \nCASEY What are we gonna do, Raph? WHAT \nARE WE GONNA- (sees bike) -hey, cool ride. \nRAPHAEL Hop on. Raph leaves Gato in a cloud of dust... but not for long. Gato clamors along... keeping up with the weaving bike! In the fray, Casey looses his mask... as it gets trampled by Gato. It's an insane chase, with Raph trying to lose him as Casey swings his bat, trying to stave off the Stone General. Suddenly - THUNK! A circular OBSIDIAN BLADE lands in his wooden bat. He looks at it. \nCASEY Um, Raph? Raph sees the blade! They manage to switch positions in mid- ride, with Casey driving and Raph in back. Raph throws kicks and punches at their pursuer when he closes in. The chase takes them to a PARKING GARAGE as they circle upwards, Gato jumping from car to car, still on their tails! ROOFTOP - They're trapped. He doesn't have a hope... aside from jumping the bike to the next roof! \nASEY \nT hisiscrazythisiscrazythisiscrazy. He lets out the clutch as they make the jump! WHAM! - Sparks and crucial pieces fly off the undercarriage. They both look back at Gato up and away at the top of the structure. \nCASEY \nSUCK ON THAT, ROCK FACE! (Gato leaves edge) \nTHAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT, PUNK! ...and then -thumpthumpthump- Gato JUMPS DOWN TOWARD THEM! \nCASEY Oh crap. Casey guns it - BUT THE BIKE DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE - as Gato is in mid-air, taking off. Casey grabs the weakening Raph and drags him off. \nC \nEXT. ROOFTOP BEHIND LARGE LETTER SIGN - CONTINUOUS \nGato lands and patrols the roof... almost SNIFFING them out. Casey and Raph are barely hidden inside a rooftop shack. Suddenly - BOOM! - Gato finds them. He tries to smash through the steel door with his bare hands! Raph leans his body into the door as a last ditch effort. He's taking a pounding as the door is denting with each slam by Gato. Casey tries to help as well. Gato comes close to breaking in. Very tense. Then- -the LIGHT on his exo-suit begins to STROBE. A signal. A signal to return home. He surveys quickly... then runs off. Casey and Raph fall out. Both shell-shocked. \nASEY Okay, so it was great seein' ya again, Raph. \n(BEAT) Raph? ON RAPHAEL - He's got a dart in his shoulder, obsidian disks stuck in his shell, and has collapsed unconscious. \nCASEY Gotta get you someplace safe, pal. And then, then I need to go buy some new undies. \nCUT TO: \nINT. APRIL AND CASEY'S LOFT APARTMENT - LATER \nApril is finishing up with her workout. She hears the fire escape outside of the building and the window slide open. \nAPRIL Casey, I think we need to talk. (turns around) I don't want- whoa. OFF HER LOOK - Casey is standing there, bracing the near- unconscious Raph, now without his Nightwatcher garb. \n", "test3_input": "CASEY Could use a little... help here... \nRAPHAEL \n(WEAK) Hey April... how ya been? \nM \nRaph passes out as we- \nWIPE TO: \nINT. TURTLES LAIR - KITCHEN \nSplinter and the other three are finishing up dinner. They close the pizza box. \nICHAELANGELO My compliments to zee chef. \n(BEAT) Le brrrraaaaaaapp! Mikey walks to the fridge of leftover birthday cake. \nMICHAELANGELO Anyone for dessert? \nEVERYONE (sick of cake) \nNO!! The phone suddenly rings. Don rushes over to the jury-rigged payphone on the wall. \nDONATELLO \nCOWABUNGA-CARL-PARTY-SERVICES- Cowabunga-dude. (face falls) Waita-slow down April. What happened to Raph? \n(BEAT) We'll be right there. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. APRIL AND CASEY'S LOFT APARTMENT - LATER \nON WINDOW - One by one, Leo, Don and Mikey slip into the window. They spot Raph on the futon, being tended to by April \nM and Casey. Mikey looks around. \nICHAELANGELO Whoa... I am in the wrong line of work. Nice pad, kids. Don immediately starts checking Raph out. \nDONATELLO His vital signs seem to be okay. (opens his eye) Pupil dilation is normal. Raph weakly pushes Donnie's head away. \nC \nRAPHAEL \n(WEAKLY) Get the... frig offa me. \nDONATELLO Temper is normal too. (to others) He's going to be fine. Health-wise, I mean. Otherwise, he's still the same old Raph. \n(BEAT) Whoa. ON RAPH'S SHELL - Two Obsidian Disks are wedged in his back with a Tranquilizer Dart. Donnie wedges out the Obsidian Disk with pliers. LOSE ON - Disk. It's beautiful and deadly. Don examines. \nDONATELLO Some sort of stone... probably obsidian, I think. \n(CLOSER) There's an engraving on it. Looks... South American. Aztec? No. It's definitely not Mayan. April swallows hard. \nAPRIL It can't be. \nDONATELLO What can't be, April? April sits down on the floor with the disk. Trying to figure things out. Casey leans down to her. \n", "test3_true": "MICHAELANGELO I'd say that's a big ten-four. \nAPRIL \n(MUTTERING) It's just a myth... a legend. \n(CLOSER) It can't be. \nCASEY And I suppose that bringing up the thirty-foot flying monster would probably just push this over the edge, huh? ON APRIL - She slowly turns to Casey. Floored. \nLEONARDO What are you talking about Casey? \nCASEY Just some story this Winters guy told us. It all started down in South America. Long before the Ashmecks and the Macaroons. \nAPRIL Azteks and Mayans. \nCASEY That's what i said. \nAPRIL Sit down, Jones. (to group) So there was this guy call Yaotl... CAM PANS TO THE RIGHT - As it passes a FG element, the screen dips to black. We hear sounds of a violent BATTLE. Monsters shrieking. Blades clashing. April's retelling Winters' story. \nDIP TO BLACK: Everyone is gathered around as April finishes. Mikey, in particular, is hunched over, intent. Casey, like before, has fallen asleep. Silence for a beat. Then- \nMICHAELANGELO Well?! WHAT NEXT?!!! \nAPRIL No one knows. The legend stops there. \nTHINKS) But it's just a legend. Donnie studies the tranq dart under a magnifying glass of April's. \nDONATELLO The micro-tech of this dart is astounding. The molybdenum is of a grade only found in a few select markets... not to mention it's current stock is going for a little more than two-grand an ounce right now. \n(MORE) \nL \nD \nL \nDONATELLO(cont'd) (looks up) What? I dabble in the market. \nEONARDO So what do we have? We have someone with a lot of money. \nONATELLO Access to technology... and the means to produce it to exact specs. \nRAPHAEL Not to mention having a keen interest in these monsters... and them four stone jokers. \nDONATELLO If you ask me, it all somehow points to Winters Corp. \nLEONARDO How do you figure that, Donnie? Donatello looks up with MAGNIFYING GOGGLES on. Sarcastic. \nDONATELLO Hello? \"Genius\"? (a beat) Well, that, and the fact that this part has a Winters Corporation logo on it. \nEONARDO Do you think he's trying to recreate the events from back then? \nRAPHAEL Well, what would you do with an army of monsters? \nMICHAELANGELO Well, aside from having your own wrestling league, I dunno... MAYBE \nTAKE OVER THE WORLD? \n"}

John looks from Ripley to her image on the monitor, then back. Sinks to his knees, reverent.  Fascination has replaced fear again.  Moves his face closer to the lid. Closer to hers... 
DAYLIGHT spills in -- John's head WHIPS towards the source of the light -- 
THE DOOR 
Open.  Kyle and the other monks. 
KYLE John - what is it?  Is this a Supply ship? 
JOHN No.  No supplies.  Kyle, there's someone in here -- 
The Second Monk looks at Kyle. 
SECOND MONK This is forbidden. 
KYLE John.  Just get the hell out of there -- 
JOHN I don't want to stay.  I have to get her out before this sinks.  You come in, give me a hand -- 
KYLE Her?  Look, this is not the supply ship, so this is technology forbidden to us. Get out of there now! 
John looks down at Ripely. A KEYPAD is mounted at the head of the tube. A red button:  "EMERG-OPEN" That's plain enough. 
JOHN All right -- 
He presses it. The Tube opens with a loud BLAST of compressed air. The Monks at the door recoil at the sound. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SPACE SHIP - ON THE SEA - DAY 
Ripley has been lowered into a large coracle.  John holds her in front of him.  Unconscious. Her head lolls as the boat rocks on the waves. The monks start to row back to short. 
FIRST MONK (reverent) A space ship... 
SECOND MONK (even more reverent) A woman... 
KYLE You shouldn't have gone in -- 
JOHN I'm supposed to be a doctor. 
He pushes Ripley's hair away from her forehead. 
JOHN She could've been lost. 
FIRST MONK Been a long time since I saw either. 
SECOND MONK It isn't sinking.  Look at it.  What are we supposed to do with it? 
KYLE What was it like in there --? 
JOHN Lights.  So many lights -- 
THIRD MONK Tow it in.  Bring it in. 
SECOND MONK It's evil. 
FIRST MONK It's just technology. 
SECOND MONK Evil technology.  Look at these fish -- 
THIRD MONK The Abbot will know what we should do with it -- 
KYLE Just lights? 
JOHN Machines.  Buttons.  Metal. 
SECOND MONK See?  Just look at the fish. 
THIRD MONK The Abbot will know. 
SECOND MONK They're boiled.  These fish are boiled. 
JOHN Thousands of lights.  Like the stars. Like Heaven on Earth. 
Ripley stirs in John's arms.  Groans. Fights to come out of her fugue state... Looks around through half-lidded eyes -- She is surrounded by rowing, cassocked Monks. MONKS?  She closes her eyes. Tries to clear the imagine.  Opens: They're still there. She looks down at the bloodied hands around her waist -- realizes she's sitting on someone's lap. Looks back over her shoulder -- 
JOHN

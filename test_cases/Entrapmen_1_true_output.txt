Touch her hair.  Her face.  She swallows.  A raw moment.  A hoarse... 
GIN Bet you say that.  To all the one-night-stands. 
But he's just staring in her eyes.  The look pins her.  She can't wriggle off.  A murmured... 
MAC No, ma'am... 
He leans to her... 
MAC Only the best of them. 
They kiss. 
EXT. STATUE SQUARE - ROUND MIDNIGHT 
CLOSE on the British Petroleum billboard, where the countdown CLOCK says...JUNE 30, 1997, 11:41 P.M., 0 DAYS, 0 HOURS, 18 MINUTES, 51 SECONDS TO:  REUNION WITH CHINA! 
The square is beyond BEDLAM.  Times Square looks deserted New Year's Eve compared to this carnival CRUSH of humanity, rock and rolling as if reunion with China was the doorway to Paradise. 
Singing, chanting, screaming, dancing, music and booze everywhere, firecrackers exploding, soldiers and civilians, tycoons and hookers, tourists and peddlers and Party members and homeless, going absolutely nuts. 
Who knows.  Could be the last party.  Ever. 
WHIP PAN to the crowded plaza in front of the towering glass-and- steel headquarters of the HONG KONG AND SHANGHAI BANK. 
ZOOM to focus on our smashing couple in evening wear, Gin with a large beaded shoulder bag.  Mac presents an invitation to a PLA soldier, who admits them into... 
INT. PUBLIC LOBBY, HONG KONG AND SHANGHAI BANK 
...a VIP party going full blast in the lobby of this truly breathtaking structure.  A central ATRIUM rises 47 floors, creating a soaring clear core, around which the offices and working spaces are ringed.  The view straight up is interrupted only at three well-spaced levels, where thick CANOPIES of glass, stitched together with spidery skeletons of steel, SPAN the open core. Mac looks up... 
...at the balcony railings surrounding the atrium, the revelers have been granted access to the lower five floors.  Above these, all is empty. 
MAC Nice of the Colonel to provide an invitation... 
She is guiding him toward one of the multiple hors d'oeuvre stations.  Half the celebrants seem to be armed PLA soldiers, many with rifles slung boldly across their shoulders. 
GIN Well, I promised him a bonus. Five million.  Comes out of your share. 
MAC ...long as I don't have to have sex with him. 
Mac loads up on six hors d'oeuvres, piling them on a napkin, as she takes two flutes of champagne.  They step away from the mob toward a potted plant near the wall, and Mac... 
...drops his snacks with a SPLAT.  Shit.  Bending to clean the mess, he slips from his waistband a flat CIRCUIT BOARD with a bank logo and a three-pronged plug.  In a single motion, he plugs it INTO a socket concealed by the pot, scoops up his canapes, and we CUT TO... 
INT. SURVEILLANCE ROOM 
Three SECURITY OFFICERS blink, as ALL FIFTY monitor screens go HAYWIRE at once.  The images compressed to a blur of lines between a series of diagonal SLACK BARS that slash across the screens.  The way your TV acts when the horizontal hold goes out.  They can't believe it. 
Stumped, they start slamming buttons, flipping switches, jabbering to each other.  Now the images begin to ROLL vertically, as if in response to their attempts at adjustment. 
Welcome to the world of high tech. 
INT. ELEVATOR BANK 
Mac and Gin wait with a party of older Brits, who've had plenty to drink and are carrying more.  Two armed soldiers flank the elevators.  A car arrives.  As the Brits enter... 
MAC (politely) We'll take the next one. 
Waiting, calmly.  Mac smiles at a soldier. 
MAC (subtitled Mandarin) What time tomorrow do the tanks roll in? 
The guy LAUGHS.  An elevator arrives.  Gin sipping champagne as they enter. 
The doors CLOSE.  They are alone.  The panel has floors 1 through 5 lit.  The other numbers, 6-10 and 16-47, are dark.  There are NO numbers 11-15. 
Mac pulls from his pocket a small flat DEVICE, not much thicker than a credit card, with a window and a series of LED lights on its face.  He fits it into a SLOT beside a black glass PLATE on the elevator panel.  Immediately, the LEDs scramble, all RED, numbers FLASH across the card's window, as the device begins to lock on the elevator code.  In sequence, the LEDs turn GREEN, and... 
...the glass plate LIGHTS, announcing in Kanji and English...ACCES GRANTED TO FLOORS 11, 12, 14, 15.  Mac presses the lit number 14. 
The elevator RISES.  He looks over at her.  She is tight enough to snap.  We can feel her heart racing from here. 
MAC So all that time, sitting at your computers.  All the research, the access codes your job allowed you to steal, floor plans, schematics... setting up all your bank accounts... 
She looks irritated.  He is smiling, gently. 
MAC Years of work, comes down to.... (checks his watch) ...six minutes.  Don't be nervous.  Easy come, easy go. 
She looks away.  The elevator stops. 
MAC Your share prob'ly works out to, what?  Dollar and a quarter an hour? 
Me laughs.  The door opens.  She is pissed off. 
GIN What's your point? 
MAC (very real) That I like you, Ginger. 
Now they're staring at each other.  An open elevator door.  An empty dim hallway.  They see only each other. 
MAC The dedication, the skill, the guts... 
He holds out the crook of his arm.  As a gentleman escorts a lady. 
MAC I'm going to see you get everything you deserve. 
Her eyes flicker on that.  So he grins... 
MAC Woman.  If you can't have fun, right now.  You're in the wrong business.

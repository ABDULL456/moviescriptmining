Frank quickly walks up to Roxanne and takes her gently by the arm. 
FRANK Come on into my office, sweetie. 
INT. CHANNEL 7 NEWS BUILDING - FRANK'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
He sits her down on his leather couch, then quickly turns toward his door. 
FRANK Can we get this woman some water for God's sake? (to Rebecca) I gave you two months off. What're you doing back? People are gonna think I'm a slave driver. 
ROXANNE Aren't you? 
FRANK Yeah, but I don't want people to think it. 
ROXANNE Frank, listen. I want to go back to work. I NEED to go back to work. 
FRANK ...You're hysterical, aren't you? 
Frank sits down on the couch and blankets Roxanne with A WARM EMBRACE. 
ROXANNE What're you doing? 
FRANK Keeping you warm before you go into shock. (toward the open door) DO I HAVE SLICE OPEN A CAMEL HUMP TO GET A GLASS OF WATER AROUND HERE? 
A SECRETARY quickly enters with a bottled water. She sets it on the table in front of them and leaves. 
Roxanne pulls herself out of Frank's grasp and stands up to face him. 
ROXANNE It was a traumatic experience. Yes, everyone knows Uberman and me were...close. But what I really need - what would really make me better is getting back to work. 
There's a sudden awkward silence from Frank. 
FRANK Well, that's going to be... 
ROXANNE I thought you'd be happy to have me back. 
FRANK Oh, we are. Honey, nothing makes us happier than to have our girl back, but... 
ROXANNE Yes? 
FRANK Things have sorta...changed. 
ROXANNE In three weeks? 
FRANK Listen, I'm not one who likes to open up wounds - especially ones that are just starting to scab, but you were sorta our go to girl for the exclusive on Uberman. And now that he's gone...I moved Brad into your anchor spot. 
ROXANNE (disgusted) Brad? Brad Helms? The man is an idiot. 
FRANK It's the suits. They think it's time to switch things up. 
ROXANNE Oh, because they can't use me to get the big story. 
FRANK C'mon, Roxie. Using is in the nature of what we do. They used you, you used Uberman. Everybody's happy. 
ROXANNE (defensive) I didn't use him. 
FRANK Oh, I didn't mean that. I know you two were in love or something. My bad. 
ROXANNE We were. 
FRANK And that's great. 
ROXANNE Very in love. 
There's a hind of self-doubt in Roxanne's expression, as if she's failed to convince even herself of this. 
ROXANNE Okay. So, where are they going to move me if Brad has my spot? 
FRANK ...Human interest. 
ROXANNE Bake sales and pet stories. 
FRANK I told them I wouldn't be surprised if you just upped and quit. You busted your ass for that desk. 
Roxanne can hardly get it out - she's busy swallowing her pride 
ROXANNE I'll take it. 
Frank looks up at her, not believing what he's hearing. 
FRANK What?

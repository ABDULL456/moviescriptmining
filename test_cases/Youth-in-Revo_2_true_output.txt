SHEENI You are completely contemptible, Nick Twisp. I never wish to see you again. With the dreadful proclamation ringing in his ears, Nick leaves. 
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT 
Nick's silhouette figure racing through the trees. 
NICK (V.O.) Here I am, reviled by friends and family. Relentlessly pursued by three police jurisdictions. Nick stops at the edge of the woods to catch his breath. 
NICK (V.O.) Fron√ßois suggests we flee the country. But where to go? Mexico? Canada? India, perhaps? He looks up the road which has been blocked off by flashing squad cars. 
EXT. LOS ANGELES - ESTABLISHING - DAY 
The downtown high-rises protrude from the layer of smog. In pre-lap, someone pushes a door BUZZER repeatedly. 
INT. JOANIE'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Joanie opens the door and finds Nick on her doorstep. 
NICK Uh, Hi, Joanie. How's it going? 
JOANIE Nick? 
INT. JOANIE'S APARTMENT - LATER 
NICK (V.O.) Since my sister can see through me, I'm obliged to give a relatively candid and thorough review of the events. Joanie listens gravely, shaking her head at the most gruesome parts of the story. Nick finishes, flopping into a chair. 
JOANIE Nick, six months ago you were just another brownnosing honor student. What happened? 
NICK I'm not really sure. I fell in love with Sheeni. All I want is to be with her. The rest is all a big misunderstanding. 
JOANIE Nick, you've stolen, vandalized, trespassed, and burned down Berkeley. All for one girl. If there's a misunderstanding, it's with your insight into females. 
NICK But... But where did I go wrong? 
JOANIE Nick, boys your age are always looking for the path of least resistance to becoming a man. A boy's whole self-esteem rests on how fast he can get a girl into bed. 
NICK So far, I agree. 
JOANIE Sooner or later what those boys realize, is that the girls you're chasing base their self-esteem on how many hoops they can get the boy to jump through before going to bed with him. Nick furrows his brow. Clearly that had not occurred to him. 
JOANIE So I guess what you should ask yourself is: How far are you willing to go? 
Nick nods in understanding. An epiphanic smile. 
NICK All the way, Joanie. I'm willing to go all the way. Joanie nods in amusement. 
JOANIE You can stay here a couple days, but eventually they'll come looking for you. I don't have much money to give you, but here. Nick takes the wad of cash, clearly moved. 
NICK Thanks, Joanie. I... Uh... I love you. 
JOANIE I love you too, you little brat. 
INT. LOS ANGELES BUS TERMINAL - DAY 
Nick slaps the cash on the counter and slides it under the window. 
NICK One ticket to Ukiah, please. 
INT. LANCE'S DUMP - BATHROOM - DAY 
Lance squats on the toilet in a neck brace. He chuckles over an issue of Penthouse. The phone rings. He picks it up 
LANCE Yeah. 
NICK (V.O.) Hey, bacon boy, it's Nick. 
LANCE Nick, ya little prick, where are ya? 
EXT. LOS ANGELES BUS TERMINAL - DAY 
Nick is crammed into the phone booth. He's wearing shades and a fedora. WE INTERCUT. 
NICK You're on a need to know basis, gorilla boy. Lance seethes inwardly. 
LANCE No matter, they'll get you eventually.

SNATCHER (NERVOUSLY) Miss Portley-Rind! What a surprise! (MORE) 
SNATCHER (CONT'D) Does your.. does your father know you're here? 
WINNIE (DISMISSIVE) No of course not! (up to Eggs) But wait til I tell him! The Trubshaw Baby! Alive! 
Winnie sees Trout towering over her. 
MR. TROUT (REGRETFULLY) Sorry, miss. 
Winnie looks at Snatcher in horror and confusion. Trout picks her up in his big hands. 
WINNIE What are you doing? Unhand me! 
SNATCHER Looks like the Boxtrolls have a new victim, miss. And her name is YOU. 
Gristle remembers Eggs. He swings his bat over his head and brings it down but Eggs leaps, grabs the rope from Pickles' missed shot, and SWINGS LIKE TARZAN towards the door that Winnie opened. 
Trout panics as he sees Eggs swinging towards him. He holds Winnie up to protect his face. Eggs barrels into Trout's belly, knocking him backward and getting him wedged in the door. 
(1300 WCH) WASTELAND CHASE 
EXT. SNATCHER'S FACTORY - DAY 
Eggs and Winnie tumble outside the factory and roll to a stop in a cloud of dust. 
SNATCHER They're getting away Mr. Gristle! 
WINNIE (PANICKED) What have you dragged me into? 
Fish calls to them from a manhole. 
FISH Eggs! Eggs! Eggs! Eggs! 
EGGS RUN! 
Eggs and Winnie run. 
EXT. INDUSTRIAL WASTELAND 
Still running Eggs and Winnie suddenly hear a loud CRASH! 
Behind them Gristle comes crashing through a high window swinging on a chain. 
MR. GRISTLE I'm swinging on a chain! 
EGGS/WINNIE AHHH! 
Eggs and Winnie slide into the manhole that Fish holds open. They make it in and slam it shut just in time for Mr. Gristle to face plant on top of it. 
MR. GRISTLE Stuck on a manhole! 
Trout finally pops out of the factory doorway. He and Mr. Pickles come running up to the motionless Mr. Gristle, standing over him. 
MR. TROUT Oww... 
MR. PICKLES Don't make no sense. That's evil prevailing over good. 
Snatcher arrives. 
SNATCHER (TO TROUT) If Lord Portley-Rind finds out that boy is alive, it will ruin everything I've worked for! 
MR. TROUT You mean, we worked for? 
Snatcher glares at Mr. Trout, silent. 
MR. PICKLES I think we're all saying the same thing here. 
MR. TROUT I don't think we are. 
SNATCHER (ANNOYED) Bah... 
Snatcher walks away, frustrated. 
MR. PICKLES But, just in different ways. 
(1400 FMR) FAMILY   REUNION 
INT BOXTROLL CAVERN - ENTRANCE CHUTES - MOMENTS LATER 
Winnie screams as she flies down the chutes, into the cavern, down the conveyor belt, and crashes into the boxtroll sleeping pile. 
INT BOXTROLL CAVERN - NIGHT 
Winnie lays amongst the scattered boxes. She pushes herself upright, coughing. Boxtrolls poke their heads out all around her and stare. 
WINNIE (gasp) Ohh! 
Winnie gets as far away from the boxtrolls as she can, bumping into Knickers as she shuffles backwards. 
WINNIE (CONT'D) STAY AWAY FROM ME! Someone, help!!! Wealthy girl in danger! 
She pushes herself against a wall. The boxtrolls gather, curious. Winnie spots Shoe nearby, with worms and bugs dangling from his mouth. She hides behind a cabbage, whimpering. 
WINNIE (CONT'D) If you're going to eat me just get it over with. I'm sure I'm delicious. 
Suddenly there is the sound of happy boxtrolls gurgling and drumming their boxes. 
Winnie peeks out. The boxtrolls are surrounding Eggs and Fish and celebrating their return. No one is paying any attention to her.

She pushes a number to delete the message. 
MOTHER (O.S.) fabulous time in Japan!  How exciting, and hope you and your adorable husband are enjoying it...I was sitting next to Cathryn Myles last night at this dinner and she was telling me about her daughter who had this awful boyfriend and a messy break-up and how hard it is,and now she's single and wants to start a family, I'm so glad that you're settled, and not in that situation.  Anyway, call me when you have a chance, I'm trying to put Thanksgiving plans together, whether we want to go skiing or. Daddy wants to stay home and have it here, which might be easier with Lauren and the children, but let me know what your feelings are, I do hope you and John can make it. Call me, I love you. 
Charlotte pushes a button. 
VOICE MAIL (O.S.) Charlotte hangs up

HERB KINCAID appears. He is laughing. He is smeared with his son's blood. In each hand he holds one of his son's shoes. 
HERB We'll bury his shoes because his feet are still in them and they're the only part of him that makes sense anymore. 
HERB laughs harder. 
HERB It's gonna be the cheapest funeral this town ever saw! 
HERB SCREAMS LAUGHTER. THE CAMERA DOLLIES IN TO CLOSE ON BRADY'S KITE. 
EXT.  THE MOON, CU 
SOUND: HERB SCREAMING. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT.  HOLY FAMILY CHURCH  DAY 
SOUND: An organ is playing that sweet old hymn, "Bringing In The Sheaves." 
There are lots of cars parked in front of the church, but there's a space left just big enough for UNCLE AL'S MG. MARTY'S Silver Bullet is strapped to the back. 
JANE (v-o) My mother and father- my mother in particular- did not much care for Uncle Al... 
INT.  HOLY FAMILY CHURCH  DAY 
MARTY'S chair is at the back of the church. Most of the mourners are crying. MRS. BOWIE is playing the organ. BRADY'S coffin is on a bier at the front - closed of course. There are lots of flowers. 
JANE (v-o continues) ...but when it came to such unpleasant duties as taking Marty to the funeral of his best friend... 
INT.  UNCLE AL, MARTY, TAMMY, AND MRS. STURMFULLER IN A PEW 
As we look at them, from left to right: UNCLE AL, MARTY, TAMMY, MRS. STURMFULLER. 
UNCLE AL unobtrusively takes a small silver flask from his hip pocket. Engraved on it in Old English letters is the word "rotgut." He spins the cap and takes a quick knock. He pauses and glances at MARTY, who looks deeply stunned. 
JANE (v-o continues) ...they didn't at all mind drafting him. As to the sort of comfort Uncle Al may have been able to offer him... 
UNCLE AL hands the flask to MARTY. MARTY looks at him questioningly for a moment, and then drinks. MARTY looks at TAMMY, who looks frankly terrible. Her mother is looking away. MARTY nudges her. She looks around at him. He offers her the flask. Her eyes widen. 
JANE (v-o continues) ...I now believe that was best kept between the two of them... 
After a brief moment's consideration, TAMMY takes the flask and has a deep swallow. She hands the flask back to MARTY, who hands it quickly back to UNCLE AL as TAMMY coughs. Her mother looks at her... then at MARTY and UNCLE AL. UNCLE AL smiles sympathetically, hiding the flask with one hand, as if to say, "Isn't it a terrible thing?" MRS. STURMFULLER looks distractedly back toward the service. 
JANE (v-o concludes) ...or among the three of them. 
UNCLE AL pockets the flask just as the organ stops playing. 
INT.  THE PODIUM, WITH FATHER LOWE 
LOWE Mr. and Mrs. Kincaid have asked that there be no mass said here this afternoon. There will be a requiem mass for Brady Kincaid this Sunday. They did ask me to say a word of comfort to you, if I could. 
He looks out at them. 
INT.  THE CONGREGATION 
They look back at LOWE, hoping for some help in understanding this awful thing. 
INT.  LOWE, ABOVE THE COFFIN 
LOWE If there is any word of comfort I can give you, it's just this: the face of the beast always becomes known; the time of the beast always passes. 
He is struggling with this, trying dreadfully hard. 
LOWE If there are times when we feel alone and afraid, only small creatures in the dark, then these are the times when we must turn to one another for our comfort and our hope. To our neighbors. To our community. To our love for each other. I alone cannot ease the pain for Herb and Naomi Kincaid, nor can I ease your pain, nor you ease mine. But if I believe anything it's this: we can comfort each other. We can heal each other. We can go on together. 
INT.  THE CONGREGATION, WITH MARTY AND TAMMY 
The kids are crying. MARTY puts an arm around TAMMY and she puts her head on his shoulder. 
INT.  FATHER LOWE 
LOWE The Bible tells us not to fear the terror that creepeth by night or that which flieth by noonday, and yet we do... we do. Because there is much we don't know, and we feel very small. But we must not be alone. We must not allow ourselves to be alone, for there is the wide gate to the hell of terror. Turn to each other. Join hands in your sorrow and try to remember that the face of the beast always becomes known. (Pause) The time of the beast always passes. (Pause) Let us pray. 
EXT.  THE MOURNERS, WITH MARTY 
MARTY and TAMMY look at each other miserably. TAMMY begins to cry- for her father as much as for BRADY, one would think- and she and MARTY embrace. 
EXT.  UNCLE AL, CU 
He looks at the kids with deep sympathy and deep love. 
EXT.  A COUNTRY ROAD  AFTERNOON 
UNCLE AL'S sports car passes THE CAMERA. He's taking MARTY home. 
INT.  THE CAR, WITH MARTY AND UNCLE AL 
UNCLE AL You all right, Marty? 
MARTY Yeah. 
UNCLE AL There's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You ever hear that one? 
MARTY No. 
UNCLE AL Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy.

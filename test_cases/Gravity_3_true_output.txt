MISSION CONTROL (RADIO) That's a date, doctor. Just remember, Houston is partial to Margaritas. 
RYAN OK, here we go... Booting comm card now. Please confirm link. (BEAT) Houston, please confirm reception of data. MISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO) Negative. We're not seeing any data. 
RYAN Stand by, Houston. I'm gonna reboot the comm card. 
MISSION CONTROL (RADIO) Standing by. 
An ASTRONAUT - MATT KOWALSKI - floats thirty meters away from the Shuttle wearing a bulky white space suit and a full, bubble- like helmet. 
ASTRONAUT Houston, I have a bad feeling about this mission. 
MISSION CONTROL Please expand. 
MATT Okay, let me tell you a story. It was '96. I'd been up here 42 days. Every time I passed over Texas, I'd look down, knowing the second Mrs Kowalsky, was looking up, thinking of me. Six weeks I'm blowing kisses to that woman. Then we land at Edwards and I find out she'd run off with a lawyer before I was off the launch pad, so I packed my car and I headed to... 
MISSION CONTROL Tijuana. You've told this story, Kowalsky. As Houston recalls, she took off in your '74 GTO. Engineering requests fuel status on the jet pack prototype. 
Matt smiles, checks the monitors of the sleek device strapped to his back. 
MATT Five hours off the reservation and I show 30% drain. My compliments to Engineering. Except for a slight malfunction on the nulling of the roll axis, this jetpack is one prime piece of thrust. MISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO) Engineering says thank you. 
MATT Tell them I still prefer my '67 Corvette though. Speaking of which did I ever tell you the-- 
MISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO) We know the Corvette story, Matt. 
MATT Even Engineering? 
MISSION CONTROL Especially engineering. We're going to miss you, Matt. 
Matt grins, fiddles with a control and propels himself away from the Shuttle. 
Stationed around the telescope are TWO ASTRONAUTS carrying out a repair mission. They are also wearing space suits but unlike Matt, they are not wearing Manned Maneuvering Units. SAFETY TETHERS are the only things stopping them from floating away into space. 
RYAN Comm card reboot in progress. 
MISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO) Thank you doctor. Shariff, what's your status? 
SHARIFF Nearly there. Replacing battery module A1 and C. 
SHARIFF DASARI is an Indian engineer in his mid-thirties. He is attached with tethers to a platform on one side of the Hubble. This is his second mission into outer space. 
MISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO) Could you be more specific? Indeterminate estimates make Houston anxious. SHARIFF No... no... no Houston, don't be anxious. Anxiety is not good for the heart... The system is ready to re- activate. 
MISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO) Hubble Telescope engaged. Upgrade fully functional. That applause you hear is for you, Shariff. Congratulations. Kick back, take the rest of the day off. 
Shariff cheers and begins singing a pop tune in Hindi, bursting into a Zero-G Bollywood choreography that is repressed by the stiffness of his space suit. 
SHARIFF (SINGING) Woohoo... Jaise Baadal Paani Ka, Yaarana Hai Oh Jaise Paani Ka, Yaarana Hai. 
MISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO) Matt, please advise as to Mission Specialist Shariff's current activity. 
MATT He appears to be doing the Macarena of some sort. Though that would merely be a best guess scenario on my part. 
Matt is now approaching the Explorer, skillfully maneuvering his thrusters. 
The other astronaut stands perched on a ROBOTIC ARM attached to the Shuttle. The arm is a crane-like moving platform remotely operated from inside the Shuttle. 
We TRACK In on the astronaut as she works intently alone. 
MISSION CONTROL Dr. Stone. Houston. Medical now have you with a temperature drop to 35.9 and heart rate rise to 70. How are you doing? 
RYAN Houston, I'm fine, it's just... (SHE SWALLOWS) ...Keeping your lunch down in zero G is harder than it looks. MISSION CONTROL Doctor Stone? Medical is asking if you want to return to Explorer? 
Ryan HUMS as she jiggles the CARD. 
RYAN No, we've been here for a week Houston, let's just finish this. 
RYAN STONE is a medical engineer, specialized in hospital scanning systems. She's focused on her work as though she's all alone in the world. This is her first mission. 
Ryan eyes the Card, then... 
RYAN (CONT'D (CONT'D) Card is up. 
MISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO) That's a negative. I'm afraid we're getting nothing on this end, doctor. 
Ryan eyes the Card, then... 
RYAN Try again. 
MISSION CONTROL (a beat, then...) Still nothing. 
RYAN Houston, could you please turn that music off?

Alex puts his key in the lock, opens the door. 
ALEX (as he goes in) Gabby? 
182 INT. CONDO - DAY 
Alex is too astonished to say a word. Jason and Gabriella are having lunch at the kitchen table. 
(CONTINUED) 
182 CONTINUED: Alex sets down his suitcase. 
ALEX I've been looking for you for two days! Jason relishes this. 
JASON You should've called home. Alex advances. 
ALEX How'd you get here? 
JASON Hitchhiked. 
GABRIELLA (too bright and 
NERVOUS) Are you-hungry? Have you had lunch? Alex doesn't even hear her. 
ALEX Why didn't you wait for me? Jason eats without answering. 
ALEX And what about all your stuff, and your mother's? Jason swallows, wipes his mouth. 
JASON She doesn't need it anymore, and I don't want it. Gabriella brings Alex a cup of coffee. 
GABRIELLA How about a sandwich? 
ALEX 
(SNAPPISHLY) I'm not hungry. Jesus. 
JASON You haven't even said hello to her. 
(CONTINUED) 
182 CONTINUED: (2) 182 
ALEX (with great control), Hello, Gabby. 
JASON 
(PROMPTING HIM) 'Did you miss me, honey?, 
ALEX What are you doing. Jason gets up from the table. He's wearing workout clothes. 
JASON Nothing. He walks out of the condo. Alex and Gabriella are left alone together. She jumps in before he can say anything. 
GABRIELLA He just lost his mother, Alex. You can't expect him to act normal. He steps up beside her and moves her hair off her shoulders. 
ALEX 
(GENTLY) Did you try to make him feel better? 
GABRIELLA (right back at him) Yes. I gave him sonlething to eat. She walks out and up the stairs to the bedroom. 
183 INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAY 183 
Alex comes into the room. She's sitting on the bed. 
GABRIELLA 
(SOFTLY) ... I feel like I made her die. Alex sits down beside her and takes her hand. 
GABRIELLA I wanted her to go away so bad... I used to wish she'd die. And then she did. He lets go of her hand. 
(CONTINUED) 
183 CONTINUED: 
ALEX Oh,. please. I don't need two children in the house. (noticing her mouth) -- What happened to your mouth? Gabriella's hand jumps to her lip. 
GABRIELLA Oh. -I bit my lip. He takes her lip between his and nuzzles it. 
ALEX 
(TENDERLY) Where? Here?... Better? She tries to laugh and nods. He holds her close. 
ALEX

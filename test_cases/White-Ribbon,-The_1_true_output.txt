The steward runs down the stairs. The mother follows him. EMMA (excited): Georg! Please wait! What did the boy do?! Please, tell me! Why are you so furious? She reaches the steward as he is just about to open the front door and places herself in front of him. EMMA (imploring, "reasonable"): Georg! Please! Calm down. If you could tell me... STEWARD (also "reasonable", in order to get rid of her): Please don't interfere. Leave me alone now! I have to go back to the Baron. He... At that moment we hear from upstairs the full SOUND of Sigi's whistle s from above, wild and lasting. For a moment, the steward is paralyzed, then he seizes the horsewhip hanging from hook in the wardrobe and dashes upstairs. We hear him thrashing the boy in the 
room, and soon the WHISTLING is replaced by Georg's SCREAMS OF PAIN After a short hesitation, the mother runs upstairs after her husband, and we now hear her trying in vain trying to control her husband. EMMA: Georg! Please! Stop it! Don't kill him...! 
69. ESTATE. DINING ROOM. COURTYARD. INT/EXT/NIGHT The meal is over. The Baroness watches the maid clearing the table and putting everything away on a tray. The Baron has stood up, standing with his back to his wife. He pours himself a glass of brandy. BARON: ... with the birches over there in Aigen that should make about six-thousand cubic meters. Working steadily, they should have finished it within three weeks. If until the end of the month we... The maid has left with the tray. BARONESS (interrupts him): I won't stay here. BARON (doesn't understand): What did you say? BARONESS: I won't stay here. BARON (turns around to her): What do you mean BARONESS: What I mean is that I shall leave with the children. BARON: What do you mean: you're leaving with the children? BARONESS:   Come  on,   Armin!  It's   not   that difficult to understand, is it? PAUSE. BARON: May I ask you how you plan to do that? BARONESS (quiet): I don't know yet. But in any case, we're leaving this place. BARON (sarcastic): We. Look of the Baroness ("I don't need that kind of irony"). BARONESS: Yes. The maid enters to clear the rest of the table. It leads to a longer PAUSE. The Baron drinks his brandy, goes to the window, waits. As the maid leaves the room, she looks at the Baroness inquiringly: 
BARONESS (to the maid): I don't need you any longer. Thank you. MAID: Good night, Baroness. Good night, Baron. BARONESS: Good night. Even after the maid has left, they remain SILENT for quite a long while. Finally, she says BARONESS: I returned from Italy only out of deceny toward you. I wanted to give us a chance. BARON (turns around): You wanted me "to give me a chance"?! BARONESS: Yes. BARON: Well, that's brilliant! And did I miss my chance? Or what? PAUSE. BARONESS (quietly): Do you think that will help us solve the problem? BARON: What? BARONESS: Your sarcasm. BARON: Actually, what is the problem that has to be solved? The Baroness looks at him, then gets up and wants to leave the room. BARON (suddenly yelling): You stay here!! She turns around, looks at him. BARON (softer): You only leave this room if I tell you to do so. She looks at him. BARONESS: Fine. She goes back to her chair and sits down. BARONESS: I wanted to spare you this, but you force me to do it: During our stay with Uncle Edoardo I fell in love with a man. He's from Lombardy, he works in the banking business and helped Uncle Edoardo in a financial matter. He courted me and was also very fond of the children. If Sigi has blossomed and grown so healthy, it's largely thanks to him. Despite all this, we came back. Because I feel committed to you. But I can't stand this place any longer. Not so much for me personally, though I can't say that life with you is exactly thrilling for a woman of my age. But if I leave this place, it's because I don't 
want Sigi, and later the twins, to grow up in surroundings dominated by malice, envy, apathy and brutality. What happened with Sigi's whistle was the last straw. I'm sick and tired of persecutions, threats and perverse acts of revenge. PAUSE. BARON: Did you sleep with him? BARONESS   (laughing   scornfully):   You   don't understand anything. BARON: Did you sleep with him? PAUSE. BARONESS (quietly): No. I didn't sleep with him. PAUSE. BARON: You're lying, aren't you? The Baroness looks at him. Then she gets up, about to leave the room again. At the same moment, somebody KNOCKS at the door. After a short gesture of irritation BARON (irked): Come in! The steward appears. STEWARD: Good evening. Could I talk to you for a moment, Baron? BARON (annoyed): Can't it wait until tomorrow? STEWARD:   It's  really   urgent.   Normally,  I wouldn't have disturbed you so late. Annoyed, the Baron leaves the room with him. As he goes out, the steward greets the Baroness with a nod. Once the door is closed, she stops for a moment, goes to the window, and looks out pensive. She ends up going to the small bar and pours herself a glass of brandy. Her hands are shaking a little. She drinks from the glass, goes back to the window and looks out waiting, taking a sip from now and then. Below in the 
COURTYARD 
a few people walk around nervously. But it doesn't look particularly unusual. A saddled horse is led into the stable. Finally, the door of the 
DINING ROOM opens again. The Baron comes back inside. He looks distressed. The Baroness doesn't know whether this is the result of her conversation, or of the message brought by the steward. The Baron paces a few steps, pondering, then glances at his wife. Finally, she asks BARONESS: What's going on?

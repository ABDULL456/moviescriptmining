{"train": "EXCALIBUR \nWritten by \nRospo Pallenberg & John Boorman \nAdapted from \"Le Morte D'Arthur\" \nby \nThomas Malory \nFinal Draft \nFADE IN: \nEXT. FOREST - NIGHT \nDarkness. The sound of battle cries and the clang of metal upon metal. The forest lights up with huge sparks flying from sword and ax as armored knights hack and swing at each other. Mounted knights collide head-on at full gallop, their armor made incandescent in the clash. Sparks eddy in their wakes and float to the ground. The forest catches fire. \nMAIN TITLES on the flames. Out of the sounds of ancient battle grows music, heroic and barbaric, shot through with melancholy. \nTwo crazed eyes reflect the fire. The eyes belong to a man without age, at once ancient and boyish, female and male; his eyes are pained from the burden of too much knowledge. So close is he to the flames that a lock of his wild hair sizzles alight. He slaps at the fire as if it were an annoying insect. He wears a cloak of black trimmed with silver. It is Merlin. The wizard weaves a path through the burning forest, dodging the combatants, searching. \nMERLIN Lord Uther! Lord Uther! \nThe forest around him weeps softly with the sounds that follow slaughter. Patches of undergrowth are smoldering. Small flames lick bark and branches. \nSmoke floats through the trees and hovers over the bodies of the dying and the dead. \nA huge knight reins up beside Merlin on a lathered horse. His armor is blood spattered. He is weary from battle. He looks down at Merlin, his countenance fierce. The blade of his sword glows with an unnatural aura. \nMERLIN It's done. A truce. We meet at the river. \nUTHER (disgusted) Talk. Lovers murmuring to each other... \nEXT. RIVER, FOREST - DAY \nWaiting on one bank of a small river that flows through the forest is a warlord, the Duke of Cornwall. He is flanked by his armored warriors. Lot of Lowthean prominent among them. They are battle-weary and bloodied, but they look ready to fight. Behind them is an army of lesser knights. \nTo the opposite bank come Uther and Merlin, a much smaller force of knights, including Uryens, Lord of Gore, surrounding them. \nDUKE OF CORNWALL I spit on your truce, Uther. If you want peace, throw down your swords. \nUther and the Duke of Cornwall glare at each other in silence across the river. Uther strains forward, burning with anger; but Merlin restrains him. \nUTHER I should butcher all and every one of them. Merlin, what is this wagging of tongues? \nMERLIN Just show the sword. \nUther unsheathes his mighty sword, and brandishes it in the air high over his head. The blade hums disquietingly and leaves a lingering electric hue upon the air. The marvel instills dread in all present. \nMERLIN (waxing eloquent) Behold the sword of power, Excalibur. Before Uther, it belonged to Lud, before Lud, to Beowulf, before Beowulf to Baldur the Good, before Baldur to Thor himself and that was when the world was young and there were more than seven colors in the rainbow. (and in an aside to Uther) Speak the words. \nUTHER (bellowing) One land, one king! That is my peace! \nThe Duke of Cornwall looks around nervously as some of his knights fall to their knees in awe. \nDUKE OF CORNWALL Lord Uther, if I yield to the sword of power, what will you yield? \nUTHER Me, yield!? \nMerlin urges Uther hard. \nMERLIN (a whisper) He has given. Now you must. \nThe two knights glare at each other, rage contending with anger. \nUTHER The land from here to the sea is yours if you will enforce the King's will. \nThe enemies lock eyes and Merlin watches anxiously. \nDUKE OF CORNWALL Done! \nHAG --I heard. I have come. I am also Merlin. \nThe figure straightens, the filthy rags become a flowing cape, and the hair is swept back by the wind, and\u00f3it is Merlin, laughing. \nMERLIN I have walked my way since the beginning of time. Sometimes I give, sometimes I take. It is mine to know which, and when. \nUTHER (exploding) Dumb riddles, Merlin. I am your King. \nUlfius edges away. \nMERLIN I know the storm inside you, and what it has wrought. The alliance I forged is wrecked. \nThe Duke of Cornwall under siege. All this for lust. Selfish lust. \nUther grabs Merlin. \nUTHER For Igrayne. One night with her. Do it. Use the magic. \nMerlin frowns pensively, his gaze searching strange distances and wandering; then focusing, blazing straight at Uther. \nMERLIN You will swear by your true kingship to grant me what I wish. Then you shall have it. \nUther kneels and draws his sword and holds it up by the blade, a cross. \nUTHER I swear it. By Excalibur and the holy-- \nMERLIN --What issues from your lust will be mine. Swear it again. \nUTHER I swear it. \nMerlin looks down sorrowfully at the kneeling King. \nEXT. BATTLEMENTS, TINTAGEL CASTLE - EVENING \nThe Duke of Cornwall watches a force of armored knights riding forth from Uther's war camp, with banners flying. It passes beneath the castle and on toward a distant cliff. \nDUKE OF CORNWALL (to a lieutenant) It's Uther and all his best knights. He leaves behind little more than fledglings to guard his camp. \nHis eyes are as cold and as pale as ice. \nEXT. CLIFF ABOVE THE SEA - TWILIGHT \nUther and his knights, and Merlin on a mule, ride to the high promontory and dismount. Here, overlooking the sea, is a circle of ancient stones, carved with strange runes and hieroglyphics, and as the wind moves through them it moans and sighs. \nThe knights watch as Merlin and Uther, leading his horse, walk toward the stones. Merlin strides into the circle, turning to look at Uther, who hesitates. \nMERLIN Come. \nUther starts to make the sign of the cross, but Merlin halts him with a gesture. Uther's hand drops, and he enters the circle with his horse. \nMerlin and Uther look out across the sea, to Tintagel Castle high upon the cliff. \nMerlin solemnly raises his arms toward that distant castle, and chants in an ancient language, the sounds of which he marries to the roaring and whining of the wind. The wind becomes stronger, and Merlin's incantations become more intense, and the wind in turn becomes wilder still. Until Merlin is charged with a fierce, nonhuman power, as the wind buffets his slight frame. \nAnd then, for all to understand: \nMERLIN I hold the balance of all things in my summoning. Arise mists. Come fog. \nEXT. VISTA FROM THE CLIFF - TINTAGLE CASTLE - TWILIGHT \nFrom the horizon a front of fog advances toward the castle to envelop it, and continues across the gulf to the circle of stones. \nEXT. GATE, TINTAGLE CASTLE - TWILIGHT \nThe portal opens and a small force of armored men, led by the Duke of Cornwall, exits. A fog is thickening all around them. \nEXT. CLIFF ABOVE THE SEA - TWILIGHT \nThe advancing front envelops Merlin and Uther, eddying around the stones.  All else is obliterated. \nMERLIN Mount your horse. \nThe King does. \nHe lifts himself up on his staff. He stands in the midst of the ancient stones, bristling with excitement. Uther's mighty knights are asleep, a deep unnatural sleep, huddled together and surrounded by their horses. And then Merlin swoons, collapsing to the ground. \nINT. HALL, TINTAGEL CASTLE - DAWN \nHis lieutenants deposit the Duke of Cornwall's bloodless body upon the long table. His eyes are wide open, icy and cunning even in death. The ladies of the castle support and comfort the grief-stricken Igrayne as she approaches the body of her husband. Morgana hangs onto her mother's gown. \nIGRAYNE When did it happen? Where? \nLIEUTENANT In the camp of Uther, my lady, just after nightfall. \nIGRAYNE It can't be. He came to me, to his bed, last night. \nLADY It was his spirit, yearning for you in his hour of death, that visited you. \nIGRAYNE His spirit? \nPale with grief, Igrayne stares at her dead husband in silence. \nThen her hand drifts to her stomach. When she talks again, undone and resolved, it is to all and herself: \nIGRAYNE Tintagel Castle falls to Uther. But what shall become of me, and the child I bear? \nMorgana shows no distress. She runs her baby hands across her father's face and closes his eyes. The intensity that was frozen in them is now added to her own pale and cunning eyes. \nEXT. CLIFF ABOVE THE SEA - DAY \nMerlin has been propped up against one of the stones. He is in a deep trance and Uther is attempting to shake him awake. \nUTHER I want her, Merlin. I cannot be without her. Tintagel is mine. Can I take her now? Tell me! \nMerlin's eyes open but he sees nothing, and only a puzzling squeal issues from him. \nINT. IGRAYNE'S BEDCHAMBER, TINTAGEL CASTLE- EVENING \nMorgana watches from a corner. The ladies of the castle surround Igrayne who is giving birth. \nNoisy crows alight on the windowsill. Only Morgana notices. \nINT. PASSAGEWAY, TINTAGEL CASTLE - NIGHT \nUther strides to Igrayne's bedchamber, his warrior knights following. He is dirty and his iron dress is blood-spattered. \nUTHER (bellowing) Three horses died under me, so hard did I spur them here. Is it born? Is it alive? \nINT. IGRAYNE'S BEDCHAMBER, TINTAGEL CASTLE - NIGHT \nAt his approach and entrance the ladies shrink back, and Morgana edges closer to her mother, and seats herself on the bed beside her. Ingrain holds her newborn baby in her arms, the blood of birth still wet upon it. \nUTHER Out! \nThe ladies slip past him to the door, and he goes up to Igrayne. \nUTHER What is it, lady? \nTerrified of him, Igrayne faces him the best she can. \nIGRAYNE A boy, sir. Rest yourself. \nUther waves away her words but does sit down on the bed, exhausted. He notices Morgana, who stares at him. \nUTHER Send the girl away. \nIGRAYNE She is just a child - \nUTHER Out! \nIgrayne draws the child to her and kisses her cheek. \nIGRAYNE (whispering) Go now. Come back later. \nThe child leaves silently, hatred in her eyes. \nUTHER She watches me with her father's eyes. \nSIR KAY Father, I'll go and see what's keeping him. \nEXT. THE SWORD IN THE STONE - DAY \nArthur stops at the edge of the dark forest, totally dejected, when he sees the sword in the stone. He walks up to it, his face lighting up, brimming with innocence. He is alone, as everyone has returned to the jousting ground. \nARTHUR If only Kay could have it... \nHe smiles, forgetting his troubles, a boy again living in a fairy tale. He grasps the sword by the hilt and it comes away easily from its stone lock. \nNot expecting it to, he nearly falls. He stares at it, terribly excited and surprised: he tucks it under his arm and rushes back. \nEXT. TENTS - DAY \nHe bumps into Kay. \nARTHUR (breathless) Your sword was stolen, Kay, but here is Excalibur. Is it too late? I hurried-- \nKay takes it. He cannot believe what he's holding in his hands. He starts to talk but he is so agitated he can only stutter. \nEXT. JOUSTING GROUND - DAY \nKay, with Arthur in tow, rushes to Sir Ector and shows him the sword; he trembles with excitement. \nSIR KAY Look, Father. Excalibur. Does that mean that I am to be king? \nSir Ector is dumbstruck. \nSIR ECTOR Did you free the sword, boy? \nSIR KAY I... did, Father. \nEctor looks at his son amazed, wanting to believe but not able to. \nSIR ECTOR We must go to the stone at once. \nWith Excalibur in hand Ector of Morven heads for the stone, Kay following, and Arthur too, the boy flushed with excitement but a little worried, not understanding what is happening. \nThe exchange between Sir Ector and Sir Kay has been overheard. Some have seen the sword in Sir Ector's hand. Rumor spreads like wildfire. \nEXT. THE SWORD IN THE STONE - DAY \nAs Sir Ector ascends the stone, from all parts of the jousting ground knights and squires, the Bishop and the clerics, and peasants too, press around. \nEctor lowers the blade into the tight cleft and Excalibur sinks to its original position. \nSIR ECTOR Draw it, son! \nSir Kay grabs the hilt and pulls without conviction, and the sword doesn't give. Eyes downcast, he lets go. \nSIR KAY Sir, I didn't draw the sword. Arthur gave it to me. \nSIR ECTOR Arthur ?! (spinning around to face him) How did you get the sword, child? \nARTHUR (frightened) Sir... Kay needed a sword. His was stolen. I saw Excalibur, and... I took it. \nSIR ECTOR You freed it, son? \nARTHUR I did, Father. I beg your forgiveness. \nHe starts to kneel but Ector pulls him up. \nSIR ECTOR Try the sword, Arthur. \nArthur is about to grasp the hilt when Uryens and Lot, and other nobles, Leondegrance of Camelyarde, and Sir Caradoc and Sir Turquine among the younger, stride up. \nURYENS Stand back, Sir Ector, and take your children. \nLOT We will try again. \nUryens, Lot, Leondegrance, Caradoc, Turquine - each in turn grapples with the sword, only to be defeated by its immobility. The crowd around the stone is thickening with common folk. \nSIR ECTOR Let the boy try the sword. \nEXT. FOREST - DAY \nArthur charges through the shadowy forest. He is in armor, but it is only a light tunic of mail. Excalibur is sheathed in a leather scabbard by his side. He is frantic and he calls urgently. \nARTHUR ...Merlin... Merlin... \nHis face shines with sweat, the horse is lathered. He dismounts and continues on foot into denser, more tangled undergrowth. \nARTHUR Merlin! \nA huge eye opens in the foreground of what had appeared to be shadow, bark and tufts of weeds is really Merlin's head. \nMERLIN You called, sir? \nHis voice is thin as he is awakening from a deep, exhausted sleep. Arthur finds him lying within the large gnarled roots of a great tree. The boy kneels before Merlin and lifts his hands and kisses them. \nARTHUR You saved me from the arrow... \nMERLIN (a flicker of mischief) But not from your destiny. \nARTHUR I want to thank you. \nMERLIN That's not why you came. \nArthur blurts it out: \nARTHUR Merlin, help me. I need your help. I don't know how-- \nMERLIN (irritated) 'Help me, Help me.' Help me get up. \nArthur helps Merlin up and the wizard stands unsteadily. \nMERLIN I'm tired. Doing magic takes its toll, you know. My arms ache terribly... (he makes flying movements with his arms and grimaces) Once--or is it yet to happen--I stood exposed to the Dragon's breath so that a man could lie one night with a woman. It took me ten moons to recover. I'm sure that story would interest you, since... Well, we'll have to talk about it another time. You're too busy now. \nThe forest groans and creaks, alive with murmurs and shrill calls. \nMERLIN It is whispered in the forest that... (he cups his ear with exaggeration) ...Leondegrance's castle is under siege by Lot and Uryens. \nARTHUR (pressing) Yes, yes, I know that. Everybody does. Lord Leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights. I can't lose him. \nMERLIN Well there. You don't need me half as much as you think you do. You already know what must not happen. \nARTHUR (exasperated) I must find the means to save him, then. I was hoping I could ask you for a little magic help, but if it makes you so tired... \nMERLIN Thank you. \nSilence. Arthur tries again. \nARTHUR It's just that I have no experience, and no men to speak of. How can I-- \nMERLIN (suddenly fierce) Because you must! You and only you. Have you forgotten that it was you who freed Excalibur? \nJust as suddenly, he is his amused, ironic self again. \nMERLIN Besides, it will be a good lesson. (giggling) The best, if it's not the last. \nArthur bows his head, confused and almost defeated. Merlin steals a look at him, and puts his arm around the boy. \nMERLIN Maybe you'd like to meet the power that gave you the sword? \nHe enjoys being cryptic. \nARTHUR How? Where? \nMERLIN In the great book. \nARTHUR What book is that? \nMERLIN (melodramatic) The book without pages. Open before you, all around us. You can see it in bits and pieces, for if mortal men were to see it whole and all complete in a single glance, why, it would burn him to cinders. \nARTHUR What?! \nEXT. FOREST AND ELSEWHERE - DAY AND NIGHT \nGuenevere watches... \nGUENEVERE No... \nEXT. OUTSIDE THE CASTLE - NIGHT \nSIR ECTOR No... Arthur-- \nThe old knight rushes after the boy, sword drawn, to defend his flank, and the others follow, a battle cry issuing from them that is terrifying in its fierceness. \nEXT. BATTLEMENTS AND BATTLEFIELD BELOW - NIGHT \n...and when she can't watch any longer, she buries her face in her hands. \nEXT. OUTSIDE THE CASTLE - NIGHT \nArthur fights like a wounded lion at the center of the savage melee of sword and shield, and once again the two sides fall apart. \nUryens and Lot are standing in the moat among the bodies of their men, are reduced to eleven knights, all wounded. \nArthur is flanked by twenty men at arms, most of them wounded, and trembling now beyond exhaustion with blood lust. Arthur steps forward alone, and addresses his opponents. \nARTHUR You are in my hands, to slay or spare. I need battle lords such as you. Swear faith to me and you shall have mercy. \nURYENS Noble knights swear faith to a mere squire? \nArthur turns, searching for Merlin. He spots him watching from a distance. They stare at each other, Merlin implacable, Arthur's eyes pleading. It's obvious that Merlin isn't going to help. \nARTHUR You are right. I'm not yet a knight. (gaining strength) You, Uryens, will knight me. \nHe unsheathes Excalibur and goes forward, kneeling before Uryens and offering him the sword. \nARTHUR Then as knight to knight I can offer you mercy. \nMERLIN (to himself) What's this, what's this?! \nArthur, kneeling, bows his head and Uryens steps up to him, his features set. He accepts the sword. Lot watches, a mad hope dancing in his eyes. \nEXT. BATTLEMENTS, CAMELYARDE CASTLE - NIGHT \nGuenevere watches, frightened for Arthur, not daring to breathe. \nEXT. OUTSIDE THE CASTLE - NIGHT \nUryens stands towering above the boy. He smiles enigmatically. He lifts Excalibur. \nMerlin is attempting to push through the crowded ranks to get to Arthur. \nHe's frantic and worried for once. \nMERLIN I never saw this... \nUryens swiftly lowers the sword on Arthur's neck; with the flat of the blade he gives Arthur the three strokes. \nURYENS In the name of God, of Saint Michael and Saint George, I give you the right to bear arms, the power to mete justice. \nArthur looks up. \nARTHUR That duty I will solemnly obey as knight and King. \nUryens is deeply moved. \nURYENS Rise, my King. I am your humble knight, and I swear allegiance to the courage in your veins, for so strong it is, it's source must be Uther. I doubt you no more. \nArthur rises and Uryens kneels and kisses his hands. Sir Ector turns away to hide brimming tears. Merlin pushes through finally, out of breath. Uryens embraces Leondegrance while Lot and the other enemy knights kneel in turn and kiss Arthur's hands. \nEXT. WOOD BY CAMELYARDE CASTLE - DAY \nThe castle can be glimpsed through the trees. A clear spring bubbles from the ground, and the sun splashes leaf, bird, squirrel, and bee with golden light, and Arthur and Guenevere too. Guenevere is serious and intent on her work. \nARTHUR Owww... \nWith water from the spring, she is bathing a large cut on his chest that has been stitched closed. Wounds on his arms, and one on a calf also show evidence of her neat sewing. She's just finishing, and she dabs his chest with a dry cloth. \nARTHUR What's in them? \nShe takes a cake and bites into it. \nGUENEVERE It is an ancient mixture, containing only soft, unborn grains, and flavored with roses. The rest is secret. \nGuenevere offers one to Arthur, and he hesitates, looking at it. \nMERLIN Looking at the cake is like looking at the future. Until you have savored its bitterness and its sweetness, its texture and its perfume, what do you really know? And then, of course, it will he too late. \nArthur bites into the cake, and Guenevere looks deep into his eyes. \nMERLIN Too late... \nFADE OUT: \nA LEGEND APPEARS: \n\"...but for years war kept Arthur from thoughts of marriage.\" \nFADE IN: \nEXT. OAK FOREST - DAY \nWar tents have been pitched beneath the majestic trees. Near the banner of the Dragon a doe grazes. Arthur is older, in battle-scarred plate armor, pacing and angry. He is watched by his wounded and bruised knights--Kay, Uryens, Lot, Leondegrance, Caradoc, and some new young faces among the ranks. No one talks. \nThe harsh clank of its battle trappings announces the arrival of a horse. All eyes watch it walk into the camp. A knight is slouched in the saddle. \nArthur runs to meet the horse, followed by squires and some of the knights. \nHe eases the rider to the ground, unlaces his helmet. It is Sir Ector, and his hauberk is badly dented. Tears burn in Arthur's eyes. \nSIR ECTOR He is the mightiest and fairest of knights. \nARTHUR We fought and won battles, and now one man defeats all my knights? I will go. \nHe pushes past the knights and goes to his horse. Kay steps in front of him. \nSIR KAY A king must not engage in single contest. I'll go again. \nArthur rises into the saddle and takes a jousting spear from the rack. \nARTHUR Where is Merlin? \nThe squires are silent. \nArthur gallops off in the direction Sir Ector came from. His knights are afraid for him. \nEXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY \nHis countenance grim, Arthur gallops along a trail bordering a plowed field when in it a scarecrow moves. It starts to run as stick-wielding farmers pursue it. It is Merlin. Arthur turns off into the field, and at the sight of an armored knight on a war horse, the farmers turn and flee. Merlin stops to catch his breath. \nARTHUR (angry) I should have left you to fend for yourself. \nMERLIN I had to weave a little enchantment on the bees so I could get some honey, and I didn't feel up to using any more magic just yet. Anyway, I was in less danger than you'll be in today. \nArthur's hand is clenched tight around Excalibur's hilt. \nARTHUR So you were stealing their honey. They should have killed you. \nMERLIN Come now. So much anger for such a little crime? Are you sure there is nothing else troubling you? \nARTHUR You know full well there is, and I go to meet it now. Come witness my revenge. \nHe offers his arm and Merlin hoists himself up behind the King. \nEXT. GORGE THROUGH THE HILLS - DAY \nA waterfall cascades into a pool. The spray casts a rainbow. Beneath it is a colorful confusion of flowers and budding trees, a place dreamlike in its beauty. \nArthur, with Merlin behind, gallops along the edge of the pool. The trail widens into a field of grass. Arthur reins beside a pile of broken lances and twisted shields. Across the field, pitched upon the trail is a war tent made of diaphanous white silk, a sky blue banner above it. Merlin slides off and Arthur continues. \nFrom the tent, a knight with jousting lance rides forward to meet him. His armor is so shiny it is a mirror. His eyes, seen through the open visor, seem to laugh. His speech is foreign, from across the sea. He is Lancelot of the Lake. \nThen Arthur sees something that startles him. Beneath the surface, suspended in the blue-green water amid the dancing weeds, he sees Excalibur, intact. \nIt is held by a maiden in flowing gown the color of water, her long hair rippling across her face, obscuring it. \nARTHUR Excalibur! Is it true? \nMERLIN The Lady of the Lake. Take it. Take it, quickly! \nArthur dips his hand under the water and grasps the hilt and the moment he does the vision in the blue-green water fades. He rises with Excalibur in hand, and Merlin speaks before Arthur can ask the question. \nMERLIN There are infinite worlds within the infinite coils of the Dragon. In one of them, which I have not traveled, the sword was forged. I only know that the King is returned to us through the instrument of his power. The game continues! \nAnd he laughs. \nJust then Lancelot stirs. Arthur rushes to his side. He loosens his helmet and removes it, uncovering damp curls. The young knight's eyes open, and his laughing charm once more animates his face. \nARTHUR Thanks to God, you are alive. \nLANCELOT (sitting up) I, the best knight in the world, bested! This is a great day, for my search is over. I love you, my King. \nHe embraces Arthur, who is overwhelmed by his childlike directness. The King helps him to his feet. \nARTHUR You are still the best knight in Christiandom. You gained a hundred advantages over me. It is I who must love you, for through your courage and patience you taught me a bitter lesson. \nLANCELOT Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place. \nARTHUR But your life and lands are far from here. \nLANCELOT I gave up my castles and my lands! \nHe thumps his breastplate. \nLANCELOT My domain is here, inside this metal skin. And I would pledge to you all that I still own: muscle, bone, blood and the heart that pumps it. \nARTHUR And a great heart it is. Sir Lancelot, you will be my champion. \nLancelot draws his sword, holding it by the blade, a crucifix. \nLANCELOT In the name of Jesus Christ and His holy blood, I swear eternal faith to Arthur, King. \nThey embrace, and Merlin watches. \nEXT. ARTHUR'S WAR CAMP - NIGHT \nConverging from different directions parties of mounted knights enter the war camp. Lancelot among them. They dismount, battle-weary and burning with the excitement of victory. They quench their huge thirst from buckets carried by squires. They rip off hunks of meat from carcasses sizzling on spits over a roaring fire. And they join the throng of knights, where stories of deeds of arms of the day are enthusiastically exchanged. \nA great number of knights are packed tightly around King Arthur, each man anxious to tell of his victories. One of them has the King's attention. \nKNIGHT ...We killed every one of them. Burnt their ship... \nArthur sees Lancelot in the throng and moves toward him. Merlin follows Arthur and is pushed and knocked around in the crush of spikes and iron. The only unarmored man in the crowd, he glares at the excited knights irritably. \nARTHUR Lancelot, how did you fare in the North? \nLANCELOT We spared the lives of a few, so they could sail home and tell their fellows what fate they met at the hands of King Arthur's knights... \nArthur turns toward Uryens. \nARTHUR And you, Uryens? \nURYENS Victory! \nARTHUR Lot, and you? \nLOT We drove the invaders into the sea. \nARTHUR You, Gawain, the East? \nGAWAIN The East is ours again. \nCheers greet each declaration. \nARTHUR The war is over. One land, one King. Peace. \nINT. CHAPEL - EVENING \nArthur and Guenevere are radiant with joy, and Lancelot behind them mirrors the ceremony of their joining in his armor; and the sweet voices of the children fill the chapel as the Bishop pours the wine into the chalice, and lifts it up before him, blessing it. \nHe turns to the royal couple. \nBISHOP Drink this the blood of Jesus Christ our Lord. \nThe chalice seems to burn with a mystical light; and as the chorus soars: \nFADE OUT: \nA LEGEND APPEARS: \n\"And Arthur built his castle, Camelot. And one day, in the far reaches of the Kingdom...\" \nFADE IN: \nEXT. FOREST, STREAM - DAY \nIt is shadowy and dark; ancient trees creak, unseen animals cry out. A rabbit hops into view and a boy leaps forward, grabbing the animal by the ears before it can move. He-- Perceval--is a wild boy of seventeen, dressed in skins with an endearing and childlike smile. \nPERCEVAL (to the rabbit) Sorry. Hungry. \nA din is heard to the forest, and it grows. Perceval glances around, panicked. The sound is the rubbing of leather upon leather, of metal on metal, for now a mounted figure in armor hovers over the terrified boy. \nPERCEVAL (stuttering) Have I taken too much? \nHe lets the rabbit go free. The threatening figure dismounts. And Perceval, cartwheels backward, landing in the stream and scooping a fish out. \nPERCEVAL (desperately trying to ingratiate) I had rabbit yesterday. Today I'll eat fish... No? \nHe returns the fish to the water. The figure steps into a pool of sunlight and a glorious halo streaks from the armor. It is Lancelot. \nLANCELOT Don't be afraid. \nPerceval is overcome with astonishment, and he kneels. \nPERCEVAL You're an angel! Not a devil... \nLancelot laughs and pulls the boy to his feet. \nLANCELOT Just a man. A knight in the King's service. \nPERCEVAL You're a man?! (he reaches out to touch Lancelot) ...with metal skin! \nPerceval is beside himself with enthusiasm. \nPERCEVAL Can I grow metal skin? \nLancelot rolls his eyes, amused. \nLANCELOT You've got a lot to learn. \nEXT. SPARSE FOREST - DAY \nLancelot is cantering and Perceval is running alongside, shouting in gasps. \nPERCEVAL I'll learn... take me... to the King... What's a... King? \nLancelot shakes his head and spurs the horse into a gallop. Perceval lengthens his stride, and keeps up! Lancelot reins to a halt. \nLANCELOT Very well. Climb up. \nPERCEVAL I will run. \nLANCELOT Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here. \nPERCEVAL Twenty days!? The world is that big? \nEXT. OUTSIDE CAMELOT, FOREST - DAY \nPerceval cannot believe his eyes. As Lancelot and Kay talk about him out of earshot, he sees things that he's never seen before; and he gapes like the country bumpkin that he is. \nMORGANA A lovestruck page! \nMERLIN Shh... yes, yes. Sit with me, please... Morgana. \nShe does, laughing and in complete control. His hand immediately slides onto her thigh. She removes it, but holds it in her hand, toying with his fingers. \nMORGANA A steamy, panting, lovestruck page. But what good are songs and poems to me? They are the barter of ordinary love. A gift that reflected your greatness is the only one worthy of your love. \nMerlin looks at her, knowing already, sad yet eager. \nMERLIN I showed you all my conjuring tricks... \nMORGANA The deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas... \nMERLIN Maybe... maybe... \nMerlin's thoughts have carried him far away, when he realizes that Arthur is addressing him. \nARTHUR Merlin, are you counselor to the King, or to my sister? \nSome knights laugh. \nMERLIN At your service, sir. \nARTHUR Then answer me this. For years peace has reigned in the land. Crops grow in abundance, there is no want. Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. Tell me, Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems? \nMERLIN Good and evil; there is never one without the other. \nArthur is taken aback. \nARTHUR Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom? \nMERLIN Never where you expect it, that's all I know. \nHe chuckles softly and Arthur is puzzled. A knight speaks out, the young knight with whom Morgana was flirting. His manner is sarcastic. \nSIR GAHALT If we have peace and justice, why is Lancelot never with us? Why is he always riding out on his quests? He must know where this evil is. \nSIR GAWAIN Could there be evil within Lancelot himself? To live above human folly, as is his aim, is to be overly proud. \nSIR GAHALT He pays no heed even to the Queens longing for his company. \nThe hall falls silent, all eyes upon the Queen. \nGUENEVERE (lashing out) What is it you would have your words mean, Sir Gahalt? \nFrightened, Gahalt doesn't answer. Morgana has slipped to Guenevere's side. \nMORGANA Don't listen to him. You are the Queen. \nArthur, ashen-faced, turns to Merlin for help, but he has escaped into sleep... \nARTHUR Sir Gahalt, answer the Queen. \nGUENEVERE No. I meant not to be angry with you, Sir Gahalt. In the idleness that comes with peace gossip has bread its own evil. You merely repeat it. Please, sir, have one of those apples that Lancelot loves, and in that gesture partake of its goodness. \nMorgana picks the bowl up and as she does so, unseen by any and with a magician's dexterity, she thrusts her fingernails deep into the top apple. She gives the bowl to Guenevere, who takes it and sweeps around to where Sir Gahalt sits, followed by Morgana. The young knight jumps to his feet. \nGUENEVERE Take one, Sir Gahalt. \nSIR GAHALT I am most honored, my lady. \nHe is too shy to take the shiniest, most beautiful apple on top, and goes for another one. Morgana giggles, and he looks at her. She looks at the apple on top and then smiles encouragingly at him. Sir Gahalt takes it and starts eating as the Queen returns to her seat. \nWith the third bite his is unable to breathe. His face goes red and he rises to his feet, attempting to call out. \nHe falls, dying immediately. All leap to their feet, and Arthur rushes to the young knight. Merlin is asleep and far from human affairs. \nArthur and Sir Gawain rise from the body of the young knight. Sir Gawain backs away from Arthur and points at Guenevere, trembling with cold rage. \nSIR GAWAIN Hear me, Lord Arthur, and knights and chieftains: I charge Guenevere with the murder of my brother. \nGuenevere, white and with a broken voice, turns to Arthur. \nEXT. FOREST - NIGHT \nLancelot has unsaddled and tethered his horse in a small clearing. He sits, resting back against a tree. He removes his helmet; he plants his sword before him, like a cross. He loosens the ties of his breastplate. He waits for day, yawning, tired. But his eyes burn, and he closes them and nods off to sleep. \nA knight appears silently hovering over him. Lancelot looks up, and his eyes go wide with fear. The knight towering above him wears armor identical to his, and he raises his sword, and the blade is descending upon Lancelot. Lancelot draws his sword from the ground and rolls away, but the knight's sword slices through his shoulder joint. Lancelot attempts to rise but already the knight, Lancelot's mirror image, is upon him. From the ground, Lancelot parries the blow and slashes at the opponent's knee, cutting through the joint in the armor and severing the leg. \nThe knight doesn't fall, doesn't bleed, doesn't cry out. On one leg he comes forward, a horror. Lancelot is paralyzed by fear. As the knight leaps upon Lancelot, Lancelot rises to meet him, impaling himself on the knight's sword below the hauberk. He throws the knight to the ground, and comes down upon him. He rips off the helmet and the breastplate. The armor is empty and Lancelot rolls over on his back, awakening from the nightmare with his own sword deep in his stomach, and in his hand his own helmet and breastplate, while other parts of his armor lie strewn around him. \nOnly then does he become conscious of the terrible pain and the shock of the truth. He grabs the hilt of his sword and draws it from his stomach. He curls up in agony, clutching a fistful of leaves to the wound. \nLANCELOT Guenevere, I fight against myself... \nHe loses consciousness. \nEXT. JOUSTING GROUND OUTSIDE CAMELOT - DAWN \nThe Bishop blesses the field. Guenevere, numb and disbelieving, is being led to the stake, which rises from a bed of straw and wood. Arthur watches, in shock. Other knights and ladies keep their distance, watching darkly, stealing glances at Arthur, mumbling disapproval of his refusing to defend Guenevere. In battle dress, Sir Gawain rides up and down the jousting run on a snorting and powerful horse, practicing. Perceval, in a mail doublet, waits beside a mangy roan, his face burning with anxiety. \nGuenevere is tied to the stake. All eyes watch for the approach of her champion. Arthur goes to Perceval. \nARTHUR Is he coming? \nPERCEVAL He heard Lady Guenevere's request and he said nothing. That is all. \nArthur hides his pain behind a rigid mask. \nEXT. JOUSTING GROUND - DAY \nThe sun has risen shining cruelly into Guenevere's eyes; the queen is alone at the stake. Sir Gawain rides up to King Arthur, who waits alone, separated from the others. \nSIR GAWAIN My Lord, the sun is upon the field. The Queen has no champion. I demand justice, as is my right. \nARTHUR So it is. \nPerceval leaps onto his horse. \nPERCEVAL Let me champion the Queen! \nSir Gawain looks at the squire with contempt. \nSIR GAWAIN (to Arthur) Since no knight comes forward, I demand justice-- \nArthur is in anguish. He searches the tree line for a sign of Lancelot. He looks from Guenevere at the stake to his own knights watching him. He draws Excalibur. A gasp goes through the crowd of onlookers. \nARTHUR Boy, kneel. \nPerceval leaps from his horse and bends his knee before the King. Arthur brings the sword down on the boy's shoulder, giving him the three strokes. \nARTHUR In the name of God, of St. Michael, and St. George, I make you a knight. Rise, Sir... \nPERCEVAL ...Perceval! \nGawain shakes his head disdainfully as Perceval mounts back into the saddle, his eyes burning with fervor. \nSir Gawain and Perceval ride to opposite ends of the field. The spectators fall silent, all staring blankly, their senses dulled by the tragedy, at the uneven combatants. \nA cry goes up. Lancelot rides out of the forest. He rides up to the King and salutes him. Arthur smiles at his old friend, tears of joy in his eyes. Lancelot bows toward Guenevere and rides on to where Perceval waits. \nLancelot reaches out to touch Perceval's cheek. \nLANCELOT It's my task to prove the Queen's innocence. \nPerceval cannot reply, his eyes affixed on the blood that trickles from Lancelot's hauberk. Lancelot raises his lance in salute to Gawain across the field. Gawain salutes in answer. \nThe two huge knights charge at each other, each man's spear tip making contact with the other's armor, and in the violent collision both are unhorsed. Lancelot is slower at getting to his feet and drawing his sword. \nHe is bleeding below the hauberk from his self-inflicted wound. \nIn the first onslaught Lancelot fights defensively, falling back. He has to toss aside his shield and hold his stomach with his shield hand. \nMorgana watches with Merlin. Every terrible blow of sword on sword reverberates through her body pleasurable. Merlin is captivated by her cruel sensuality. \nEXT. JOUSTING GROUND - LATE DAY \nLANCELOT It is deep... \nArthur is about to rise to embrace him, but checks himself. \nARTHUR You will be sorely missed. Heal yourself and come back. \nThe exchange has become closely intimate, even though they stand apart and speak before everyone in the large hall. Lancelot leaves. Only Guenevere cannot watch. \nEXT. FOREST GLADE -DAY \nWater gurgles from a rock that is captive in the roots of an ancient oak. Lancelot, in armor, reclines against its trunk, the roots cradling him. He is perfectly still, drawing life from the vibrant, all-enfolding forest. \nFlower petals drift on the breeze. Trees sigh. Fox and rabbit, sparrow and hawk, at peace with each other, watch over the knight. \nEXT. FOREST -DAY \nA horse and rider tear through the thick undergrowth. It is Guenevere. The forest races past her as she gallops toward the glade, brambles tearing at her flesh and clothes. \nEXT. FOREST GLADE - DAY \nLancelot gets to his feet, tense. Guenevere dismounts and approaches. She is flushed and breathless from the wild race. Her horse, left free, wanders over to his and grazes beside it. \nLANCELOT Why? You will destroy Arthur, and us... \nShe moves closer and he thrusts out his mailed fist to keep her away. She clutches it and presses the metal to her soft tear-streaked cheek. \nLANCELOT The law forbids it. \nGUENEVERE Love demands it. \nHungry with passion, she embraces the cold unmoving armor, kissing it. \nLANCELOT There are things about love-- \nGUENEVERE --Nothing! \nHe steps back, drawing his sword. He holds it up by the blade between them. \nLANCELOT By my knight's sword, I swore faith-- \nAnd before he can finish she grabs the blade to push it aside. He holds it fast. Blood streams from her bare hands. He cannot prevail without cutting them deeply. He lets go of the sword, and she lets it fall to the ground. \nShe embraces his still and defeated hulk. She kisses the metal, and sensation shoots through him, dizzying him. \nLANCELOT Guenevere... \nHe folds her in his arm, and their bodies lock together as though a trap had sprung. Their mouths meet, each devouring the other... \nEXT. BATTLEMENTS, CAMELOT - DUSK \nArthur and Merlin, the King desperate, the Wizard overwhelmed by compassion: \nARTHUR I am alone and betrayed. By my wife, by my beloved friend, by my knights. And by you. Perhaps most of all by you. For you made me, you forged this wretched life. And like a child tired of a toy, you toss me aside, a babbling lecher trotting after my sister... \nMERLIN That is my destiny. I have a destiny, too... \nARTHUR With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at... \nMERLIN My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks... (with sudden enthusiasm) Yes! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness, I join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. But you! You betray yourself. \nARTHUR Me? I have lived by the oath of king and knight. \nMERLIN You betray the boy who drew the sword, the boy who saw the Dragon... the Dragon who moves close by, coiling and uncoiling, restless, looking down, waiting for the King to be a king... \nArthur looks up and in the rolling clouds maybe, just maybe, the form of a dragon is taking shape. Arthur draws Excalibur, intensity animating his dead features. \nARTHUR I must do it myself. I must kill them both. Lancelot and Guenevere. Will you ride with me, Merlin? \nMERLIN I cannot. I must not. Here I must stay. \nThey embrace. Merlin is on the verge of tears, his face immediately sad and finally ancient. Arthur exits. \nMorgana, who has been watching from the shadows, watching from the shadows, slinks up to Merlin's side. \nMERLIN Happiness or horror. \nINT. CAVE BENEATH CAMELOT \nThey pass through jaws of stalactites and stalagmites. Merlin cracks his staff whip-like and a ball of fire billows up from the tip and illuminates a cave wildly veined and filigreed with minerals and crusted with growths of crystals. The light goes out but the malachite and the gold, the quartz, diamond and beryllium burn dully. He turns to her, suddenly tall and unstooped, younger, sleek and evil. \nMERLIN In the folds of the earth where the forces that hold the world together are more alive, my power is strongest. Here I will possess you, as a man possesses a woman. And the god, the eunuch, the mule that I was, will be no more. \nHe sweeps her up into his arms. \nMORGANA You are truly magnificent! \nMERLIN Flattery! Do you think I am ignorant of your stupid little games? Preying on you weakness of others. That's your power, a petty evil. Mine is great. Great plans. Impossible dreams. Laughable endings... \nHe deposits her on bare rock. He kisses her. She pushes him away. \nMORGANA Merlin, the powers of Summoning, the true Name of the charms of Doing and Undoing. Show me! \nMERLIN I won't. You would misuse such power. I have paid enough for you, and I will have you. \nShe leans forward and kisses his ear and whispers. \nMORGANA Make magic, my foolish wizard. For our love. Weave a marvelous room around us, a room worthy of our coupling. \nShe draws closer, kissing him deeply. He breathes heavily. \nMERLIN What do you want? You must desire it for me to weave it. \nMORGANA Walls of shining crystals, burning with red fire, furnishings of metals and jewels never seen by man... \nMorgana falls silent as Merlin raises a hand, majestically intoning a harsh repetitive charm. The mineral veins of the cave begin to glow and fog seeps out from them enveloping the couple. \nMERLIN Desire it and it will be as you desire. \nMorgana burns with intensity. Merlin utters a formula and the fog coalesces around them into the shimmering presence of crystal walls, fountains raining jewels, flowers made of scented air, a bed of glass shot with light and covered with skins of animals dead before the time of man, goblets of ruby, tapestries woven of golden hair. She reaches out to touch the wall and her hand plunges through the unmaterialized illusion. \nMORGANA It's only a semblance. You disappoint me. \nShe begins lacing up her loosened gown. \nMERLIN Don't touch the walls. Come close to me. \nShe does, a mad hope in her eyes. She kisses his chest. \nMORGANA Do it, Merlin, the deepest secret. Fix it with the charm of Making, for our endless pleasure. \nHe utters the ancient charm, Morgana listening closely, memorizing it. The illusion is all of a sudden solid. \nMERLIN For you... \nShe runs her hand across the hard crystal surface, her eyes gleaming. \nFrom outside the wondrous room they can be seen to embrace. He carries her to the magical bed where he makes love to her, as they disappear from view in its effulgent light. \nShe comes out through the crystal door, burning with evil intent. She turns to watch him asleep in the bed. \nShe utters the charm of Summoning learnt from Merlin, and the room melts into an eddying carmine fog. Within it, Merlin struggles to awaken from the torpor of love, alarmed. \nOutside, Morgana utters the charm of Making and the gaseous mass begins to crystallize. \nInside, Merlin is rising to his feet, breathing the red fog, his movements slowing to a standstill, his mouth opening in a scream of horror. \nThe cloud has metamorphosed into a magnificent cluster of red crystals.  Morgana peers into its facets and there she sees, in fragments, Merlin's terror... an eye, the gaping mouth, a clawing hand--as he is entombed in the stone. She laughs in triumph. \nEXT. FOREST - CAMELOT - DAY \nSurrounded by forest, the spires and battlements of Camelot rise under black storm clouds. Arthur and Kay ride back to the castle. \nINT. HALL OF THE ROUND TABLE - DAY \nThe great hall is in gloom. Few knights are in attendance at the table. \nSome sleep off last night's wine. Arthur approaches, haggard, searching. \nINT. CHAPEL, CAMELOT - NIGHT. \nA bolt of lightening strikes the chalice, rocking the chapel, and Arthur is knocked back violently. \nRain lashes in through the shattered window upon the terrified knights. They and the priest back away. Arthur is left alone. He rises and goes to the chalice, which is bent and cracked. He kneels before it. Steam hisses up as rain falls on it. \nINT. HALL OF THE ROUND TABLE - DAY \nSun streams in. Many of the knights are in attendance, in full armor. \nLadies and pages watch from dark corners. Arthur addresses the fellowship. \nHe holds the cracked chalice in his hands. He burns with a new-found fervor. \nARTHUR Who will ride the labyrinths of the forest, to the very root of his soul, to the very ends of the earth, to find the secret that will redeem us from the evil that has fallen upon us, and make this chalice, and ourselves, whole again? \nGawain rises and draws his sword in salute. \nSIR GAWAIN I will ride forth in the name of that quest, and commit my strength and my soul to it. \nPerceval, Kay and a few others draw their swords and touch their lips to the blades in oath. Sunbeams splash off their armor. \nPERCEVAL I will go. \nThe rest of the fellowship draw their swords in imitation, but the resolution within them is not strong. Arthur comes forward to Gawain. \nARTHUR Gawain, a dreadful fear is upon me, that we may never meet again, that the fellowship will be no more... \nHe embraces Gawain, tears in his eyes. He turns to Perceval, and Perceval kneels. \nPERCEVAL We will find the secret or die. \nArthur kisses the young knight's brow. Then he turns to Kay. \nARTHUR Kay, I know your heart yearns to go, but I am prisoner to my duties, and you must be to yours, at my side. \nArthur and Kay watch the knights file out till the hall is empty, the harsh song of their armor growing distant. \nFADE OUT: \nA LEGEND APPEARS: \n\"For nine years they searched. Morgana's power grew in the land.\" \nFADE IN: \nEXT. SNOWSCAPE - DAY \nUnder a leaden sky, Gawain drives his horse through swirling snow. He comes upon a mounted knight who is frozen in his tracks. He brushes the snow from the man's face. The frozen features belong to Caradoc. He slowly continues on his way. \nEXT. DEAD FOREST - DAY \nDangling from the branches of a dead tree are a dozen dead knights of the Round Table, crows pecking at the rotting flesh in the chinks of armor. Perceval rides up, cries out in horror, and spurs his horse away. \nEXT. MOORS - DAY \nThe rotting carcasses of sheep. The crops blackened and withered on the stalk. Hungry peasants head for a distant hill. \nEXT, HILLSIDE, MOORS - DAY \nA giant head has been carved out of an outcrop of rock, its stone mouth gaping toward the sky. \nPeople are congregated around the mouth. Peasants and farmers, they are wild with excitement, responding to drums throbbing and bagpipes wailing. \nThey watch Morgana, who is surrounded by knights in dark armor. At her side is an angelic boy of eight, his eyes cold as his mother's. Morgana is more beautiful than ever, in flowing druidic robes, the gossamer silk clinging to her sweat-drenched body. \nShe is standing by the deep hole which forms the giant's open mouth. It is covered by a tooth-like grating acting as a drain for the blood of human sacrifices made there. Before her is Gawain, chained and struggling against five strong men who hold him. Morgana lifts a dagger and plunges it into Gawain's chest. The fountain of blood that gushes from the great knight's body drives the crowd into a frenzy. \nMORGANA (intoning) The blood of this knight will feed the god in the earth, he is weak with hunger, and he will be made strong by this blood. Then he will plant his seed, and the land will be fertile once again. \nGawain, his blood flowing from him and into the giant's mouth, looks up in anguish. His bellowing voice is echoed and amplified by the hollow beneath the drain. \nGAWAIN Arthur, forgive me. I die without the secret. I have failed. \nIt is very dark and Perceval has to feel his way. \nHe comes to the edge of a stream. He kneels to drink, and the horse drinks beside him. Then he rests back on his heels, brooding, too tired to rise. \nHe lowers his eyes, staring into the dark water, defeated, empty. \nBefore him in the water a long thin bar of light appears. He looks at it amazed. Voices are heard singing very far away. He reaches out to touch the long strip of light but his hand just disturbs the water. It is a reflection. The strip grows wider and the ethereal music is closer. \nPerceval looks up. The strip of light is before him, suspended, thirty feet above. It continues to grow wider. A drawbridge is being slowly lowered, allowing a powerful light to escape from within. \nPerceval is terrified. In pain, he slowly rises into the saddle, ready to gallop off; but fascinated, hypnotized by the sight, he cannot, and he stays and watches. \nThe dim outline of a castle becomes visible as the drawbridge is lowered across the water to the ground at his feet. At the center of the blast of light coming from the castle, Perceval can make out a burning chalice. The music swells to a terrifying pitch, searing the forest. \nEXT. ENTRANCE TO CASTLE - NIGHT \nAt the sight of the chalice, Perceval masters his fear. Bathed in light and music, he spurs the horse forward onto the drawbridge. \nOnce he is on it, the bridge begins to rise. Unsure of its footing and blinded by the light, the horse becomes skittish, and Perceval has to struggle to control it. He dismounts to lead it, but the horse is terrified, rears up and jumps off the bridge, which continues to rise, drawn up by unseen hands. \nPerceval hesitates, then advances down the sloping drawbridge into the castle courtyard. All details are bleached out by the blinding light. The chalice appears suspended in space, and now the figure of a man can be glimpsed standing behind it. \nEnchanting music from unseen singers grows and weaves. Perceval looks back to see the drawbridge slowly closing, trapping him inside. \nHe approaches the figure, his courage ebbing. Hands cupping the chalice, it speaks to him. \nFIGURE What is the secret of the chalice? Who does it serve? \nPerceval doesn't understand. He glances back again. The drawbridge is nearly closed. Terror seizes him. \nPanicked, puzzled, baffled, he backs away. He scrambles up the drawbridge desperate to reach the top before it closes. He claws his way up till his hand grasps the top. He heaves himself through the narrow closing slit which is about to crush him. He screams, and with a final effort he wriggles free and topples over crashing into the water below. \nEXT. DEAD FOREST AND STREAM - NIGHT \nHe looks up. The drawbridge thunders shut, the last thin strip of light disappearing; and now he is surrounded only by the silence of the forest. \nWhere there was a castle, now there is darkness. Perceval wades through the water. He has crossed the stream and all he can see and feel are tree trunks. The castle has disappeared. He is utterly defeated. \nPERCEVAL The chalice. The secret was in my grasp. I let it slip, afraid for myself. A question was asked. I didn't understand. I didn't try. I failed... \nFADE OUT: \nA LEGEND APPEARS: \n\"Nine years passed.\" \nFADE IN: \nINT. CAVE BENEATH CAMELOT. \nDripping water is steadily encrusting the crystal with limestone. \nINT. HALL OF THE ROUND TABLE, CAMELOT - DAY \nDead knights lay on biers. The once glorious seat of power is falling into decay. Few are in attendance around the table. Agitated, Kay enters and goes to Arthur, who is worn and haggard, and aged. \nKAY Your son Mordred is at the gate. \nArthur comes alive. \nARTHUR At last... \nKAY Don't recognize him. You were trapped by Morgana's sorcery. \nARTHUR (staring off) ...Gawain and Perceval, Bors and Bohort, Caradoc and Ector, and all the others--lost to me. Only the echo of their voices remains in this empty hall. All I have left is the memory of their fellowship. Echoes and memories. I am a ghost of the King that once was... (he turns to Kay and with sudden harshness) ...Mordred is real, alive, my own flesh and blood. I will see him, I must. \nEXT. GATE, INSIDE AND OUTSIDE CAMELOT - DAY \nThe drawbridge lowers slowly, and Arthur moves away from Kay and the other knights, and advances across it. \nRooks wheel over the dead trees of the forest that surrounds Camelot. A group of armed men waits at the edge of the forest. One steps forward, a huge knight in black armor, the metal defining and exaggerating the powerful musculature of his body. He is Mordred, a young man of eighteen, and of extraordinary beauty. A page follows ten steps behind him bearing an enormous spear, its points hooded. Arthur stops at the edge of the drawbridge, the huge knight a few steps from him. Kay, ready for anything, moves halfway across the drawbridge. \nMordred kneels on one knee. \nMERLIN I know. I have heard noises and echoes through the stones... \nARTHUR What is this place, Merlin? \nMERLIN It is like a tree. The roots of the stones spread out across the land and they draw on the thoughts and actions of men. Like sap those human matters course through the stones feeding the stars that are the leaves of the tree. And the stars whisper back to men the future course of events. (becoming passionate) But the earth is being torn apart, its metals stolen, and the balance is broken and the lines of power no longer converge. In fact, I nearly didn't make it in one piece. \nHe limps affectedly and stretches with exaggerated pain. \nMERLIN But, I'm here. \nARTHUR Where have you been these many years? Is it true that Morgana-- \nMERLIN --Stories... You brought me back. Your love brought me back. Back to where you are now, in the land of dreams... \nARTHUR Is this a dream? Tell me, Merlin! \nMerlin smiles, turns and leaves, heading for Arthur's camp, giggling. Arthur starts off after him and awakens from the dream when he walks into one of the stones. It takes him a moment to realize that Merlin has vanished. \nARTHUR Merlin?! \nHe hurries away toward the camp. \nINT. KAY'S TENT, ARTHUR'S WAR CAMP - NIGHT \nArthur shakes Kay awake, and as the faithful knight comes out of a deep sleep, he clutches Arthur's arm. \nKAY Merlin, will I live...? (he shakes away the dream) ...I was dreaming... \nARTHUR Of Merlin? \nKAY Yes. He spoke to me. He said I would fight bravely tomorrow. I have never dreamed of Merlin before. \nARTHUR I dreamed of him too... Merlin lives! He lives in our dreams now, in that dark and shadowy place that is as strong and real as this more solid one. He speaks to us from there. \nEXT. MORDRED'S WAR CAMP - NIGHT \nCape flowing, Merlin sweeps between Mordred's war tents, and in the logic of dreams, unseen by the guards. He passes a tent where the huge shadow of Mordred is thrown on the canvas, as he sharpens the blade of a fearsome spear. \nHe enters a tent. \nINT. MORGANA'S TENT - NIGHT \nShe is stunningly beautiful in her sleep. Merlin leans over her lovely body, kisses her softly on the lips, and waits for her to awaken. \nMERLIN I have returned, enchantress. You are beautiful, magnificent. Have you used up all the magic you stole from me to keep yourself young? Have you any magic left to do battle with Merlin? \nINT. TENT - MORGANA'S DREAM \nShe rises from her sleeping body. \nMORGANA You provoke me, Merlin. \nMERLIN What's behind that beauty? A wizened, cold-hearted snake. \nMerlin steps back, grandiose and melodramatic. \nMERLIN You are a snake about to strike! \nHe raises his staff. \nMERLIN And I am the staff that drives the snake back. \nHe lowers the staff with dreamlike slowness and she slinks right up to him. \nMORGANA Burning with the fire of desire, I am the flames that consume the staff to ashes. \nShe winds her fluttering hands around the staff, and the shadows they cast upon the tent give the illusion of licking flames. \nMERLIN I am the cloudburst that quenches the flames. \nMORGANA I am the desert, where water disappears-- \nMERLIN --I am the sea, which covers the desert forever under its weight. \nEXT. MOORS BY THE SEA - FOG - DAY \nIt is full day, and the fog blinds with its painful glare. Arthur with Perceval at his side rides through the fog, searching. Perceval takes up a challenge against the King. He unhorses this opponent, piercing him with his lance. He returns to the King's side. \nPERCEVAL There are too many on Mordred's side. We cannot hold out much longer. \nKay is glimpsed fighting on foot, hurt, barely holding his own, but then the sight is hidden in the fog. \nKay overcomes his opponent and stops to catch his breath. He is amazed by what he sees. A knight, in old, battle-scarred armor whose pieces don't match, cuts down the knights in black in foray after foray, wheeling and turning in a brilliant and ruthless spectacle of martial arts. He fights without a shield, a lance in his left hand and sword in his right. \nKay moves away in search of Arthur. \nArthur and Perceval watch the lone knight meting out death with such terrible beauty, weaving in and out of the fog. \nKAY He can be no other. \nARTHUR Lancelot?... It is Lancelot! \nHe spurs his horse forward to join him, but Perceval is quick to stop him. \nPERCEVAL No, my lord. We seek Mordred. \nKAY I will join him. \nKay rises onto a fresh horse and gallops away. \nEXT. MOORS BY THE SEA - FOG - LATE DAY \nArthur and Perceval ride alone, the accompanying knights gone, the dying and the dead and the crazed horses all around them. \nSquires are carrying Kay upon his shield. He is dead. Arthur leaps to the ground and reaches out to touch his face, and closes his eyes. He stifles his tears. \nARTHUR Has anyone seen Lancelot? \nSQUIRE He lies over there, sir. \nArthur rushes off, Perceval following on horseback. \nLancelot is mortally wounded, blood flowing from his abdomen, his eyes open but his gaze dead. Arthur falls to his side. \nARTHUR Squire! Here! \nBut there is no one now except the dead and wounded, and Perceval, who dismounts to watch over the King, sword drawn. Desperate, Arthur stops the wound with his hand. Lancelot's eyes are sightless, but tears spill from them. \nLANCELOT Arthur. \nARTHUR Lancelot, I will save you... Don't die. \nHe tears off a piece of his tunic and staunches the wound with it. \nLANCELOT My salvation is to die a Knight of the Round Table. \nARTHUR You are that and much more. You are its greatest knight, you are what is best in men. Now we will be together-- \nLANCELOT --It is the old wound, that has been opened. I have always known it would be the gateway to my death, for it has never healed. Let my heart do its job, my King, and pump me empty... \nArthur takes Lancelot in his arms and rests his lips against the knight's brow. \nLANCELOT (a death whisper) Guenevere, has she come to you, is she Queen again? \nHe lies, closing his eyes, unable to look at Lancelot. \nARTHUR She is, Lancelot. \nA boyish smile settles over the features of Lancelot's face, and he dies. Arthur holds him to his breast, his eyes shut tight. \nA strong wind rises. Perceval kneels beside Arthur. \nPERCEVAL The fog is lifting. Only we remain alive. \nEXT. MOORS BY THE SEA - EVENING \nArthur and Perceval rise, and as far as they can see across the green hills that roll down to the sea lies the aftermath of the massacre. Hacked bodies, abandoned armor, steaming horse carcasses, everything still. The murmur of the dying is carried on the wind to the soft roar of the sea. The squires have fled the scene of horror. \n", "test1_input": "As Merlin walks through the castle, the baby crying in his arms, the knights and ladies step back, afraid to intervene in royal matters. \nINT. HALL, TINTAGEL CASTLE - NIGHT. \nMerlin comes across the empty banquet hall, cooing to the baby, strangely pacifying him. Morgana steps out of the shadows in his path, and Merlin stops at the sight of the little girl, her pale eyes glaring at him. \nShe speaks haltingly and clearly while far-off Igrayne cries out her distress. \nMORGANA Merlin, are you now the father, and the mother, of the baby? \nStaring at her, Merlin shudders and without answering he continues away, faster now, and into an unlit passageway, disappearing from sight a bit sooner than an ordinary mortal would have. \nEXT. FOREST - DAY \nThe forest is dark and shiny with rain. An unseen battle rages. \nThe first combatant in sight is Uther, who swings the mighty Excalibur, cutting an attacker in half at the waist. Uther and a small force of knights, Ulfius among them, are retreating through the slippery wet forest, completely outnumbered. \nLord Lot of Lowthean and Lord Uryens of Gore are the leaders of the attack. \nURYENS (to his men) The King's sword. I must have it. \nUlfius and his men stand their ground so the King may escape the onslaught. They are hacked down. \nUther flees alone, severing the limbs of any man and tree that stands in his way. \nEXT. STONE IN THE FOREST - DAY \nUther has gained on his pursuers. He comes to a small clearing where the spine of a buried boulder rises through the forest floor. He stops upon it, breathing hard, dripping blood. He rages aloud, but his throat is raw and cracked and only a whisper comes out. \nUTHER Merlin, where are you? To weave a mist, to hide us... \nHe hears his pursuers closing in. \nUTHER No one shall have the sword. No one shall wield Excalibur but me. \nHe holds it by the hilt with both hands, the blade pointing to the ground of stone. He flexes his knees. He lifts up his hands above his head. And with all the strength that rage and pain can muster, and more, he drives the blade of Excalibur into the stone, nearly to the hilt. His mouth widens in an awful silent scream, and then the foam of saliva pink with blood issues from deep within him, so violent was his effort. \nAs the sword cuts into the rock, the earth shudders. \nEXT. FOREST - DAY \nThe forest quakes. The knights searching for Uther halt in fear. \nEXT. FIELDS, WOODS - DAY \nAnd far away, a caped figure is crossing a field toward a wood, when the earth shakes, stirring animals and birds. The man turns. He is Merlin, the two day-old baby peeking from his cape. Merlin is amazed at the phenomenon, he puts his ear to a rock protruding from the earth. \nMERLIN Into the spine of the dragon! (and then he is saddened) Uther... I loved you, mighty child. \nAnd tears welling, and giggling at the same time, he whisks away into the woods. \nEXT. STONE IN THE FOREST - DAY \nUther staggers away, colliding with trees, staggering, crashing to the ground. Until the only life left in him is the coursing of his blood, flowing from his gaping mouth onto the leaves on the forest floor. \nThe enemy knights advance through the trees. They prod at the fallen leviathan, they roll him over to get at his scabbard. Only then do they see the sword in the stone, and they stop, amazed and afraid. Their captains appear. Uryens sees what they are staring at, and races to the sword and attempts to pull it out. \nHe strains with all his might, but it is immovable. \nLOT Let me. \nHe shoves Uryens aside, but he can't loosen the sword either, and he rages with frustration. \nFADE OUT: \nLEGEND APPEARS: \n\"Fifteen years passed and the land was without a king.\" \nFADE IN: \nEXT. FIELDS - DAY \n", "test1_true": "The peasants watch in mute anger. \nEXT. FARMYARD - EVENING \nSir Lot leading another group of mounted knights comes galloping into a small hamlet, panicked chickens and pigs scattering at their approach. The farmers run for their lives as the steel men dismount, leading their horses to water and hay, and searching for vittles. A knight spots a woman who stands frozen with fear, and he drags her into the barn as her crying child watches. \nEXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT - MOONLIGHT \nA farmhouse is burning nearby, and three mounted figures make their way along a trail at a walking pace - an old knight in leather and mail, a young knight proud in gleaming new armor; and on a farm horse, a squire with baggage and jousting lance. The old knight, Sir Ector, is troubled by what he sees. \nSIR ECTOR It is a dark hour... everywhere lawlessness and destruction, and no one to lead us out of it. \nJust then, ten crazed peasants emerge from the darkness, hurling stones and armed with clubs and pronged sticks. They surround the three riders. Sir Ector wheels around and slices the air with his sword to ward off the ambushers. \nSIR ECTOR Listen all. I am Sir Ector of Morven and these are my sons. You would wrong me, for I have never stolen from others, or destroyed the fruit of the land. \nThe peasants edge closer, working up the nerve to rush the horsemen. The sound of thundering hooves cuts through the clamor. \nA cavalcade of riders, armor gleaming in the moonlight, advances across the fields at a gallop. Immediately the peasants scatter. The old knight is on the verge of tears. \nSIR ECTOR The people's anger is just. It is sad that for our own safety, we will have to ride to the tournament with these robber knights. \nEXT. SITE OF THE SWORD IN THE STONE - SUNRISE \nRed with the first light of day, Excalibur rests in the stone as King Uther left it. The field is itched with tents, each flying its heraldic banner. Knights and squires are everywhere, preparing horses and armor for the joust. A burly man in religious robes harangues the crowd, vying for attention. \nBISHOP This is Easter day, when Christ rose again. Who will find strength in victory of arms? Who will draw the sword? \nThe Bishop goes among the tents, through the teeming throng, solemnly casting holy water upon man and horse, armor and banner. The knights kneel at the Bishop's transit, but ceremony does not lift the air of grimness that lies over the event. \nEXT. JOUSTING GROUND, SWORD IN THE STONE - DAY \nTheir armor ablaze with sunlight, two mounted knights thunder toward each other at full gallop, lowering their long jousting lances. As they meet, the lance of each knight is deflected by the shield of the other. A gasp goes through the crowd, and the two knights charge past each other. They wheel around at the end of the jousting ground and go at each other again from the other direction. Again lances strike, and this time one of the men is hit in the chest and violently unhorsed. The crowd cheers. \nEXT. THE SWORD IN THE STONE - DAY \nThe victor, Leondegrance, rides up to the stone and dismounts. Each great knight with his coterie of lesser knights comes to watch. A charge of expectation is in the air, although most knights are glowering with envy. \nLeondegrance of Camelyarde ascends to the sword, grabs it by the hilt, and begins to tug with all his might. Excalibur is immovable. The moment of tension passes. Leondegrance staggers toward his waiting squires, who lead him away. All the others return to the battle sport. \nEXT. JOUSTING GROUND - DAY \nAt the edge of the jousting ground Sir Ector's son Sir Kay is getting ready for a bout. His brother Arthur is buckling the new armor while his father fusses about him, making small adjustments when he notices that Kay's scabbard is empty. He turns to Arthur and grab's him by the ear. \nSIR ECTOR Arthur, where is Kay's sword? A good squire doesn't forget his knight's sword. \nThe fifteen year-old boy blushes. \nARTHUR I left it in the tent, sir. \nSIR ECTOR Well hurry then, and get it. \nThe boy dashes off as Sir Ector shakes his head, not without affection beneath the sternness. \nEXT. TENTS - DAY \nArthur runs in search of their tent. He finds it. \nINT. TENT - DAY \nHe enters. The saddle trunk has been emptied on the floor, equipment is scattered all over. Arthur is shocked, nonetheless he rummages madly. Finally he stops, on the verge of tears. \nARTHUR It's been stolen.... \nEXT. TENTS - DAY \nHe comes out, utterly defeated, and frantic. He stops by two knights who are arguing angrily; and one of them has left his sword in the grass. \nArthur looks at it. He is tempted to steal it, but he can't. Head down, he wanders off. \nEXT. JOUSTING GROUND - DAY \nSir Ector and Sir Kay are waiting. \n", "test1_id": 549, "test2_input": "Lancelot wheels his horse around. \nLANCELOT I hear the stifled cry for help, I smell the reek of fear... \nWith a shout the knight and his men draw their swords and rush Lancelot. He reins in his horse, causing it to rear and break their attack. He slides off, falling on his feet with sword drawn, already fighting. In an extraordinary show of sword play he cuts down six men. \nINT. FARMHOUSE - DAY \nHearing Lancelot storm in, the man holding the child hands her to a woman and kneels before the altar, just as Lancelot bursts into the room, sword high and already swooping down on the man's neck. Lancelot brings the sword to a halt mid- air, his fury held in check. The repent man is spared. The woman kneels to kiss Lancelot's hand. \nEXT. SITE OF THE SWORD IN THE STONE - DAY \nThe field is pitched with war tents and pavilions decked for holiday. Nobles and knights flank the King and Guenevere, a beautiful vision in white samite, a wreath of flowers around her head. Lancelot leads a long file of prisoners to the King. They fall to their knees, begging forgiveness; among them is the man whom Lancelot had spared before the altar. \nLANCELOT These men repented before God for their evil deeds. Those who would not, met their fate at the end of my sword. (he kneels) Accept the fruit of my first quest as my wedding gift. \nARTHUR I do. Rise, Lancelot, come with me. \nHe rises and follows Arthur and Guenevere into the central pavilion. Pages draw its curtains closed as they pass inside. \nINT. PAVILION - DAY \nGuenevere is surrounded by a group of ladies and maids who fuss over her dress and her hair. They eye the great knight and whisper about him, Guenevere laughing with them. \nArthur sits, excited and happy. \nARTHUR Sit beside me, Lancelot. \nLancelot sits, stiff and upright. \nARTHUR Your deeds set an example for all other knights. For your gift, ask a gift of me. \nLANCELOT Only give me leave to ride out again, to do what I am most able to do, and happiest doing. \nGuenevere overhears. She approaches and Lancelot jumps to his feet. \nGUENEVERE (to Arthur) He must stay for the feasting days of our wedding, and tell his deeds himself. \nARTHUR (to Lancelot, smiling) I grant you your wish if you grant Lady Guenevere hers. \nLANCELOT I will stay Madame. \nMerlin leans close to Arthur. \nMERLIN The knights of Galys approach the camp. It would be politic... \nARTHUR ...to ride out and meet them. \nHe rises. Lancelot, who was about to sit again, straightens. \nARTHUR I will ride with Sir Kay. Lancelot, rest here. \nGUENEVERE Don't start a war on my wedding day! \nARTHUR Without Lancelot?! \nArthur and Merlin exit, leaving Guenevere and Lancelot. She looks at him, lively and amused, and he can't help smiling. \nGUENEVERE Look Lancelot. The maids and ladies whisper about you. They all dream of winning you, young and old, fair and ugly. \nLancelot blushes. \nGUENEVERE But surely that's no secret to you, dear Lancelot. You're the bravest and strongest knight they've ever seen, and beauty has kissed your brow. \nHe can't look at her. \nGUENEVERE The well-kept secret is whether any of them has won your heart. \nLANCELOT No. \nGUENEVERE Why? \nLANCELOT I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough. \n", "test2_true": "LANCELOT There is one. \nGUENEVERE Who?! \nLANCELOT You. \nGUENEVERE Me? \nLANCELOT Yes. I would swear my love to you. \nGUENEVERE To me? But why? \nLANCELOT I cannot love as a woman the lady who will be wife to my King and my friend. And, in pledging my love to you, I cannot love any other woman. \nGuenevere smiles, moved by his blunt innocence. \nLANCELOT I will see you in all women, and I will defend them as I would defend you. \nHe kneels, kisses her thigh, rises and leaves. \nINT. CHAPEL - DAY \nA chorus of children sings. The Bishop waits at the altar with his friars and altar boys. Cornucopias overflowing with vegetables and wildflowers adorn the church, which glows with the light of a thousand candles. Sir Kay is satisfied. He comes back up the petal-strewn aisle. \nEXT. CHAPEL, SITE OF THE SWORD IN THE STONE - DAY \nArthur and Guenevere are ushered in by Kay. They are flanked by Leondegrance and Sir Ector. Lancelot and Merlin follow, leading the cortege of knights and ladies. \nMerlin is incapable of entering the chapel, as if at the threshold there is an unseen force that repels him. \nLANCELOT Lord Merlin, are you ill? \nMERLIN No, no, I need air. \nStrangling a laugh he wrenches himself away. Just then Uryens and a small party of knights rides up through the tents and dismounts in front of the church. Uryens helps a lady off her horse and joins the cortege on foot. \nURYENS Merlin, don't you join the celebration? \nMerlin, who was slinking away through the throng of bystanders, looks up. What he sees sends a chill through his body. \nAt Uryens' side stands a young woman of sinister beauty, with bewitching eyes of ice. Merlin just stares at her, and she smiles back at him faintly. \nURYENS My wife, Merlin. Lady Morgana of Cornwall. \nMORGANA I remember you, Merlin. I was a child. You took my brother away. \nMerlin laughs. Uryens shrugs and continues into the chapel with Morgana. As she enters she glances back, and just then Merlin steals a look, their eyes meet. \nINT. CHAPEL - DAY \nUryens and Morgana take their places near the altar. Arthur and Guenevere kneel before the Bishop, and Arthur takes her hand. The clatter of armor mingles with the enthusiastic, happy singing of the children, and seems to strengthen their song. \nEXT. SITE OF THE SWORD IN THE STONE - EVENING \nThe chorus carries across the field to the dark wall of trees from which issues another chorus, of hoots and squawks and howls. Merlin advances along the edge of the forest. He stops by the stone that once held the sword, his eyes wild. He forgets his inner torment when he sees a plant at the base of the stone. He kneels beside it and plucks it. He admires its strange flowers; he smells them. \nTwo feet appear at his side. He rises to be face to face with Morgana. They look deep into each other. Then Merlin breaks the silence. \nMERLIN You left your husband's side? You left your brother's wedding? \nMORGANA Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin? \nMERLIN It is. \nMORGANA Can it truly be used for magic? \nMerlin smiles at last, and Morgana does, her eyes piercing, cruel and lovely. \nMERLIN Yes... sometimes... \nHis gaze drifts toward the chapel. \nMERLIN ...There are many powers in this world. \n", "test2_id": 550, "test3_input": "EXT.

CASTLE GATE - NIGHT \nHe steps onto the bridge and walks in. He crosses the courtyard as the drawbridge closes behind him. All details of the castle are bleached out by the searing light. \nINT. CASTLE, VARIOUS \nHeading for the source of the light he ascends what seem to be a staircase. He enters a hall where the chalice stands suspended, burning with light, and the mysterious music swirls and grows. \nPerceval approaches the diaphanous and featureless Figure who stands over the chalice. \nFIGURE Who does it serve? \nPERCEVAL You, my lord. \nFIGURE I have waited long for you. Once you almost saw, but fear blinded you. Why am I served from the chalice? \nPERCEVAL Because you and the land are one. \nFIGURE I am wasting away and I cannot die. And I cannot live. \nPERCEVAL You and the land are one. Drink from the chalice. You will be reborn and the land with you. \nPerceval cups his hands around the chalice to lift it. But they close on nothing, and he draws back. The Figure's hands, although insubstantial, grasp Perceval's and appear to hold his hands around the cup. \nFIGURE But who am I? \nPerceval begins to kneel. \nPERCEVAL You are my lord and King. You are Arthur. \nThe blinding light vanishes, the music drifts away. \nINT. HALL OF THE ROUND TABLE - NIGHT \nPerceval falls to his knees before Arthur and he holds the chalice, now whole again, up to the King. It fills with blood from within and Arthur takes it from Perceval. He drinks. And having done so, he seems to become younger and to grow in strength. \nARTHUR I didn't know how empty was my soul until it was filled. \nSir Kay stands by the vast fireplace where a small fire burns, and only now looks up and is aware of Perceval. \nKAY Perceval, you have returned! \nARTHUR Ready my knights for battle; they will ride with their King once more. I have lived through others far too long! Lancelot carried my honor and Guenevere my guilt. My knights have fought my causes. Mordred carries my sins. Now, at last, I will rule. \nEXT. WOODS AND FIELDS - NIGHT \nArthur at the head of a small force of knights, their armor shining beneath the moon, gallops through the land. Where hooves thunder, the ground becomes alive with sprouts and tendrils, and bare trees start to bud, and grasses to blossom, the power of Nature exploding into life. \nINT. CONVENT - DAWN \nAn old nun approaches the doors, upon which someone is pounding loudly. She opens the peephole. It is Arthur. \nNUN Go away. No man is allowed beyond these doors. \nARTHUR I am Arthur. \nThe old nun is amazed and starts pushing open the many bolts, mumbling and agitated. \nINT. CONVENT COURTYARD - DAWN \nShe leads the King, his footsteps ringing in the silent cloister, past the doors to the cells. His armor is wet with dew and it shines with a dull and deep luster. Nuns whisper at his transit. She opens the door to a cell and Arthur steps inside. \nINT. CELL - DAWN \nCandles flicker on a small altar before which a nun is praying. She turns to see who has entered. It is Guenevere, older, thin with self-denial, all the more beautiful. She looks up at the majestic figure who stands before her. She nearly swoons. He helps her to her feet, and words rush from deep within him. \nARTHUR Guenevere, accept my forgiveness, and put your heart to rest. We have suffered to long. I have always loved you, and I still love you. \nShe weeps. \n", "test3_true": "ARTHUR Forgive me, my wife, if you can. I was not born to live a man's life, but to be the stuff of future memory. The fellowship was a brief beginning, a fair time that cannot be forgotten; and because it will not be forgotten, that fair time may come again. Now once more I must ride with my knights to defend what was, and the dream of what could be. \nGUENEVERE I have kept it. \nShe draws back the covers of her pallet, and there is Excalibur. Arthur is overwhelmed by emotion; he can barely speak \nARTHUR I never dared to hope all these years that it was in your keeping. \nHe kneels before her and kisses her thigh. She gazes off, remembering the life of long ago. He rises and looks off into her eyes, unable to find the words; he finally does. \nARTHUR I have often thought that in the hereafter of our lives, when I owe no more to the future and can be just a man, that we may meet, and you will come to me and claim me as yours, and know that I am your husband. It is a dream I have... \nHe takes Excalibur by the hilt and exits. \nINT. CONVENT COURTYARD - DAWN \nThe nuns scatter before him in awe and terror. He strides forward, Excalibur in hand. He stops and tests its balance, and he draws force from it. \nARTHUR Guenevere... \nEXT. WOODS - DAY \nExcalibur gleams in the sunlight. Arthur holds it high, at the head of a small force of knights under the banner of the Dragons. Kay and Perceval ride at his side. Plumed helmets, shields blazing with armorial colors, pennants flying in the clean wind from their lances; it is a brave sight. The trees are in blossom and dandelion fluff billows up at their passage. \nEXT. PIT, MOORS - DAY \nArthur's group comes to a halt. Two knights and a few squires galloping from the opposite direction rein in before the King. The knights draw their swords in homage, and the older one addresses Arthur. \nKNIGHT It is only me and my son. All other knights of the dukedom have rallied to Mordred. \nArthur smiles hiding the hurt. He points to an open pit, a huge devastation. \nARTHUR What horror is that? \nKNIGHT Mordred, sir. He digs for precious metals, with which he buys the loyalty of men at arms, binding them to his side. \nEXT. THE MOORS - ARTHUR'S WAR CAMP - LATE EVENING \nIt is a clear night and the sky blazes with stars. A crescent moon casts its silvery light upon Arthur, who wanders from his camp alone. \nEXT. STONEHENGE, THE MOORS - LATE EVENING \nHe stops in the ancient circle of Druidic stones. \nARTHUR I am outnumbered ten to one by Mordred's forces. Merlin, I need you at my side as you were once, my friend, to give me courage. There are no war tricks that will fool Mordred. He was weaned on blood. \nHe falls on his knees in front of the stone, tired, between thinking and dreaming, and he bangs his mailed fist against it. \nARTHUR More than I ever did, I need you now. Where are you, Merlin? Is it true that Morgana has trapped you? \nINT. CAVE BELOW CAMELOT \nThe veins of crystal glow darkly, and the hammering of Arthur's fist upon the stone is dimly echoed here. In the red crystal, fragments of Merlin can be glimpsed, trapped, frozen. \nEXT. STONEHENGE - LATE EVENING \nArthur slips off into sleep. The stones around him distort. He speaks softly, but then though the words continue, his lips are closed. \nARTHUR ...If only you could be at my side, Merlin, to see me wield Excalibur once more... \nINT. CAVE BELOW CAMELOT \nThe crystal is cracking, shards falling to the cave floor. \nEXT. STONEHENGE - NIGHT \nArthur is still on his knees, and he sits back, looking up. But the atmosphere is different, within a dream, and the stones of the henge loom larger over him now. \nARTHUR What is this place? It is rumored Merlin, that you drew your power from these circles... \nA hand ruffles the King's hair. He turns, and is face to face with Merlin, standing over him. Arthur looks at him without surprise, as though the intervening years never were. Merlin begins to laugh his hideous giggle. Arthur rises. \nARTHUR Quiet. You'll wake the men, and they must fight tomorrow for their very lives. \n", "test3_id": 551}

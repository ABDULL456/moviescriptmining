{"test1_input": "Guenevere watches... \nGUENEVERE No... \nEXT. OUTSIDE THE CASTLE - NIGHT \nSIR ECTOR No... Arthur-- \nThe old knight rushes after the boy, sword drawn, to defend his flank, and the others follow, a battle cry issuing from them that is terrifying in its fierceness. \nEXT. BATTLEMENTS AND BATTLEFIELD BELOW - NIGHT \n...and when she can't watch any longer, she buries her face in her hands. \nEXT. OUTSIDE THE CASTLE - NIGHT \nArthur fights like a wounded lion at the center of the savage melee of sword and shield, and once again the two sides fall apart. \nUryens and Lot are standing in the moat among the bodies of their men, are reduced to eleven knights, all wounded. \nArthur is flanked by twenty men at arms, most of them wounded, and trembling now beyond exhaustion with blood lust. Arthur steps forward alone, and addresses his opponents. \nARTHUR You are in my hands, to slay or spare. I need battle lords such as you. Swear faith to me and you shall have mercy. \nURYENS Noble knights swear faith to a mere squire? \nArthur turns, searching for Merlin. He spots him watching from a distance. They stare at each other, Merlin implacable, Arthur's eyes pleading. It's obvious that Merlin isn't going to help. \nARTHUR You are right. I'm not yet a knight. (gaining strength) You, Uryens, will knight me. \nHe unsheathes Excalibur and goes forward, kneeling before Uryens and offering him the sword. \nARTHUR Then as knight to knight I can offer you mercy. \nMERLIN (to himself) What's this, what's this?! \nArthur, kneeling, bows his head and Uryens steps up to him, his features set. He accepts the sword. Lot watches, a mad hope dancing in his eyes. \nEXT. BATTLEMENTS, CAMELYARDE CASTLE - NIGHT \nGuenevere watches, frightened for Arthur, not daring to breathe. \nEXT. OUTSIDE THE CASTLE - NIGHT \nUryens stands towering above the boy. He smiles enigmatically. He lifts Excalibur. \nMerlin is attempting to push through the crowded ranks to get to Arthur. \nHe's frantic and worried for once. \nMERLIN I never saw this... \nUryens swiftly lowers the sword on Arthur's neck; with the flat of the blade he gives Arthur the three strokes. \nURYENS In the name of God, of Saint Michael and Saint George, I give you the right to bear arms, the power to mete justice. \nArthur looks up. \nARTHUR That duty I will solemnly obey as knight and King. \nUryens is deeply moved. \nURYENS Rise, my King. I am your humble knight, and I swear allegiance to the courage in your veins, for so strong it is, it's source must be Uther. I doubt you no more. \nArthur rises and Uryens kneels and kisses his hands. Sir Ector turns away to hide brimming tears. Merlin pushes through finally, out of breath. Uryens embraces Leondegrance while Lot and the other enemy knights kneel in turn and kiss Arthur's hands. \nEXT. WOOD BY CAMELYARDE CASTLE - DAY \nThe castle can be glimpsed through the trees. A clear spring bubbles from the ground, and the sun splashes leaf, bird, squirrel, and bee with golden light, and Arthur and Guenevere too. Guenevere is serious and intent on her work. \nARTHUR Owww... \nWith water from the spring, she is bathing a large cut on his chest that has been stitched closed. Wounds on his arms, and one on a calf also show evidence of her neat sewing. She's just finishing, and she dabs his chest with a dry cloth. \n", "test1_true": "ARTHUR Ye... \nGUENEVERE --I'm pretty good at stitchery. I've sewn my father's wounds more than once. \nHe starts to get up. \nGUENEVERE Careful! You'll have to stay still for a few days or you'll tear them open. \nArthur shivers at the thought. \nARTHUR But I have to leave tomorrow. The forests are thick with rebels, invaders plunder our shores... \nGUENEVERE --And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued? \nARTHUR I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter. \nGUENEVERE Well, then, I shall tell you which knights have maiden daughters, so you can avoid their castles. \nArthur smiles at her, enjoying her jealousy, and it irritates her a little. \nGUENEVERE No, I think it's better if you just stay here to heal. At least a week. \nARTHUR I'm going. \nGUENEVERE Quiet, or I'll sew up your mouth too. \nShe touches his lips with hers, her eyelids fluttering shut. He stares at her young beauty, and draws her into a long, slow kiss. \nA shrill almost human squeal pierces the air not far away. Arthur pulls away startled, half-rising. Guenevere giggles. \nGUENEVERE Would you rescue me from a fiery dragon, sir? \nShe puts her arms around him, drawing him close again, speaking in a half-whisper. \nGUENEVERE It's just a furry little rabbit that took the bait and sprung the trap. \nThey smile at each other, about to kiss. As they come closer: \nGUENEVERE You'll find him served up to you tonight, cooked in a most excellent sauce... \nINT. BANQUET HALL, CAMELYARDE CASTLE - EVENING \nThe soft beat of psaltery and the liquid flow of lute. A serving platter bearing roast rabbit in rampant position is carried across the hall. It is laid on the long raised table before Arthur, who presides in the middle. He looks at it suspiciously and blushes, remembering the afternoon; and it looks back at him accusingly with its cherry eye. \nGuenevere is dancing around her father, lovely, gliding, sensual. She sees Arthur and the rabbit and laughs out-right. He twists off a leg of the rabbit and sinks his teeth into it to hide his embarrassment. Guenevere passes to another partner, smiling at him, radiant. Arthur watches her, his heart breaking. He is in love. \nMerlin leans close. \nMERLIN A king must marry, after all. \nARTHUR ...of course... \nOnly then does he realize that Merlin has understood everything. He is annoyed at being so transparent. \nARTHUR I love her. If she would be my queen, my dreams would be answered. \nMERLIN (mischievous) There are maidens as fair, and fairer than Guenevere. If I put my mind to it, I could see them now, many of them, weeping for love of you, watching the hills for you coming from the high towers of their castles. Offering you their every favor. Rich, clever--but if it is to be Guenevere, so be it. \nA shadow of doubt crosses Arthur's brow. \nARTHUR Who will it be? Put your mind to it, then. \nMERLIN Guenevere. And a beloved friend who will betray you. \nARTHUR (smiling) Guenevere... \nMERLIN You're not listening. Your heart is not. Love is deaf as well as blind. \nGuenevere approaches, smiling and coquettish. She slaps her hands, and a servant sets down a tray of pastries before Arthur. \nGUENEVERE They are only for you, for in them I mixed things that heal, but not too quickly; and things that make limbs sleepy, preventing escape, but keep one's mind sharp. \nShe smiles at Arthur's embarrassment and confusion. \n", "test1_id": 549, "test2_input": "MORGANA A lovestruck page! \nMERLIN Shh... yes, yes. Sit with me, please... Morgana. \nShe does, laughing and in complete control. His hand immediately slides onto her thigh. She removes it, but holds it in her hand, toying with his fingers. \nMORGANA A steamy, panting, lovestruck page. But what good are songs and poems to me? They are the barter of ordinary love. A gift that reflected your greatness is the only one worthy of your love. \nMerlin looks at her, knowing already, sad yet eager. \nMERLIN I showed you all my conjuring tricks... \nMORGANA The deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas... \nMERLIN Maybe... maybe... \nMerlin's thoughts have carried him far away, when he realizes that Arthur is addressing him. \nARTHUR Merlin, are you counselor to the King, or to my sister? \nSome knights laugh. \nMERLIN At your service, sir. \nARTHUR Then answer me this. For years peace has reigned in the land. Crops grow in abundance, there is no want. Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. Tell me, Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems? \nMERLIN Good and evil; there is never one without the other. \nArthur is taken aback. \nARTHUR Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom? \nMERLIN Never where you expect it, that's all I know. \nHe chuckles softly and Arthur is puzzled. A knight speaks out, the young knight with whom Morgana was flirting. His manner is sarcastic. \nSIR GAHALT If we have peace and justice, why is Lancelot never with us? Why is he always riding out on his quests? He must know where this evil is. \nSIR GAWAIN Could there be evil within Lancelot himself? To live above human folly, as is his aim, is to be overly proud. \nSIR GAHALT He pays no heed even to the Queens longing for his company. \nThe hall falls silent, all eyes upon the Queen. \nGUENEVERE (lashing out) What is it you would have your words mean, Sir Gahalt? \nFrightened, Gahalt doesn't answer. Morgana has slipped to Guenevere's side. \nMORGANA Don't listen to him. You are the Queen. \nArthur, ashen-faced, turns to Merlin for help, but he has escaped into sleep... \nARTHUR Sir Gahalt, answer the Queen. \nGUENEVERE No. I meant not to be angry with you, Sir Gahalt. In the idleness that comes with peace gossip has bread its own evil. You merely repeat it. Please, sir, have one of those apples that Lancelot loves, and in that gesture partake of its goodness. \nMorgana picks the bowl up and as she does so, unseen by any and with a magician's dexterity, she thrusts her fingernails deep into the top apple. She gives the bowl to Guenevere, who takes it and sweeps around to where Sir Gahalt sits, followed by Morgana. The young knight jumps to his feet. \nGUENEVERE Take one, Sir Gahalt. \nSIR GAHALT I am most honored, my lady. \nHe is too shy to take the shiniest, most beautiful apple on top, and goes for another one. Morgana giggles, and he looks at her. She looks at the apple on top and then smiles encouragingly at him. Sir Gahalt takes it and starts eating as the Queen returns to her seat. \nWith the third bite his is unable to breathe. His face goes red and he rises to his feet, attempting to call out. \nHe falls, dying immediately. All leap to their feet, and Arthur rushes to the young knight. Merlin is asleep and far from human affairs. \nArthur and Sir Gawain rise from the body of the young knight. Sir Gawain backs away from Arthur and points at Guenevere, trembling with cold rage. \nSIR GAWAIN Hear me, Lord Arthur, and knights and chieftains: I charge Guenevere with the murder of my brother. \nGuenevere, white and with a broken voice, turns to Arthur. \n", "test2_true": "She begins to swoon and Morgana keeps her steady on her feet. Arthur slumps into his seat and Sir Gawain kneels before him. \nSIR GAWAIN I champion this truth: That Queen Guenevere murdered Sir Gahalt with the aid of sorcery. \nEnraged, Arthur reaches for Excalibur. But with effort he checks his impulse. \nARTHUR The Queen will be in my charge till a champion steps forward to fight on her behalf. \nGUENEVERE Not you, my husband? \nArthur cannot look at her. \nSIR GAWAIN She must be burnt at the stake. That is the sentence for murder done with magic. \nARTHUR It is. Lords and knights of the Round Table, as her husband I say that this deed was not done by Guenevere. Who among you will champion this truth? \nNo one responds. Guenevere falls into her seat. Arthur searches the eyes of his knights and they evade him. \nARTHUR Sir Caradoc! You! \nThe knight looks up. \nCARADOC I am torn. \nSir Ector, old and feeble, weeps for Arthur. Someone speaks up. It is Perceval, who kneels before the Queen. His voice is unnaturally loud, and his eyes shine with held-back tears; he stutters. \nPERCEVAL I will champion you, my lady. \nHe is overwhelmed by his own boldness. He looks around. All eyes are upon him. Guenevere smiles at him, sadly. \nGUENEVERE I thank you, but you are not yet a knight. \nPERCEVAL I will find Lancelot! He will come! \nPerceval hurries from the hall. Arthur looks away, ashamed, and his eyes fall on Merlin, twitching and mumbling in his sleep. \nMERLIN Boys!... boys will be boys... \nEXT. HOVEL - COUNTRYSIDE - DAY \nIn full armor but for his helmet, Lancelot is seated at a small table in the shadow of a tree, eating an apple. \nA young girl is turning a chicken on a spit, and her mother is removing freshly-baked bread from an oven. It is very peaceful and silent until, galloping all out, Perceval arrives. Frantic, out of breath, he leaps from his lathered horse. \nPERCEVAL I have found you. The Queen. An apple. Tomorrow. Sir Gawain... \nLANCELOT --It must wait, child. These good ladies, for whom I intervened once, will honor me with a meal. I am beholden to them now as I was when they begged my protection. \nThe two women set the chicken and the bread before the great knight, and stand back to watch him eat, flushed with excitement. Perceval falls silent, in awe of Lancelot. \nINT. BEDCHAMBER, CAMELOT - NIGHT \nArthur stands hunched over the fireplace, staring into the flames. Guenevere paces back and forth to a window. \nGUENEVERE Why can't you be my champion? \nARTHUR If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband. \nGUENEVERE And you cannot love me... \nARTHUR The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, high and low, or they are not laws at all. Lancelot will come... \nGUENEVERE And if he cannot be found, no other knight will champion me, though you beseeched each and every one of them. Why be king if there is no one you can call loyal subject but an eager boy? \nHe hides his anguish from her. Numb with hurt, she goes to a tall curtained window, and draws it open, and stands there looking out upon the surrounding forest, silent and still beneath the moon. \nEXT. WINDOW - NIGHT \nShe cries softly, and she whispers the name of the great knight. \nEXT. EDGE OF THE FOREST, WALLS OF CAMELOT - NIGHT. \nA mounted knight stands motionless at the edge of the forest, his armor gleaming with dark lustre. It is Lancelot. His eyes are raised to the high window, where he sees Guenevere. He watches her in silence. In the high window Guenevere draws the curtain and Lancelot reins back into the forest. \n", "test2_id": 550, "test3_input": "EXT. FOREST - NIGHT \nLancelot has unsaddled and tethered his horse in a small clearing. He sits, resting back against a tree. He removes his helmet; he plants his sword before him, like a cross. He loosens the ties of his breastplate. He waits for day, yawning, tired. But his eyes burn, and he closes them and nods off to sleep. \nA knight appears silently hovering over him. Lancelot looks up, and his eyes go wide with fear. The knight towering above him wears armor identical to his, and he raises his sword, and the blade is descending upon Lancelot. Lancelot draws his sword from the ground and rolls away, but the knight's sword slices through his shoulder joint. Lancelot attempts to rise but already the knight, Lancelot's mirror image, is upon him. From the ground, Lancelot parries the blow and slashes at the opponent's knee, cutting through the joint in the armor and severing the leg. \nThe knight doesn't fall, doesn't bleed, doesn't cry out. On one leg he comes forward, a horror. Lancelot is paralyzed by fear. As the knight leaps upon Lancelot, Lancelot rises to meet him, impaling himself on the knight's sword below the hauberk. He throws the knight to the ground, and comes down upon him. He rips off the helmet and the breastplate. The armor is empty and Lancelot rolls over on his back, awakening from the nightmare with his own sword deep in his stomach, and in his hand his own helmet and breastplate, while other parts of his armor lie strewn around him. \nOnly then does he become conscious of the terrible pain and the shock of the truth. He grabs the hilt of his sword and draws it from his stomach. He curls up in agony, clutching a fistful of leaves to the wound. \nLANCELOT Guenevere, I fight against myself... \nHe loses consciousness. \nEXT. JOUSTING GROUND OUTSIDE CAMELOT - DAWN \nThe Bishop blesses the field. Guenevere, numb and disbelieving, is being led to the stake, which rises from a bed of straw and wood. Arthur watches, in shock. Other knights and ladies keep their distance, watching darkly, stealing glances at Arthur, mumbling disapproval of his refusing to defend Guenevere. In battle dress, Sir Gawain rides up and down the jousting run on a snorting and powerful horse, practicing. Perceval, in a mail doublet, waits beside a mangy roan, his face burning with anxiety. \nGuenevere is tied to the stake. All eyes watch for the approach of her champion. Arthur goes to Perceval. \nARTHUR Is he coming? \nPERCEVAL He heard Lady Guenevere's request and he said nothing. That is all. \nArthur hides his pain behind a rigid mask. \nEXT. JOUSTING GROUND - DAY \nThe sun has risen shining cruelly into Guenevere's eyes; the queen is alone at the stake. Sir Gawain rides up to King Arthur, who waits alone, separated from the others. \nSIR GAWAIN My Lord, the sun is upon the field. The Queen has no champion. I demand justice, as is my right. \nARTHUR So it is. \nPerceval leaps onto his horse. \nPERCEVAL Let me champion the Queen! \nSir Gawain looks at the squire with contempt. \nSIR GAWAIN (to Arthur) Since no knight comes forward, I demand justice-- \nArthur is in anguish. He searches the tree line for a sign of Lancelot. He looks from Guenevere at the stake to his own knights watching him. He draws Excalibur. A gasp goes through the crowd of onlookers. \nARTHUR Boy, kneel. \nPerceval leaps from his horse and bends his knee before the King. Arthur brings the sword down on the boy's shoulder, giving him the three strokes. \nARTHUR In the name of God, of St. Michael, and St. George, I make you a knight. Rise, Sir... \nPERCEVAL ...Perceval! \nGawain shakes his head disdainfully as Perceval mounts back into the saddle, his eyes burning with fervor. \nSir Gawain and Perceval ride to opposite ends of the field. The spectators fall silent, all staring blankly, their senses dulled by the tragedy, at the uneven combatants. \nA cry goes up. Lancelot rides out of the forest. He rides up to the King and salutes him. Arthur smiles at his old friend, tears of joy in his eyes. Lancelot bows toward Guenevere and rides on to where Perceval waits. \nLancelot reaches out to touch Perceval's cheek. \nLANCELOT It's my task to prove the Queen's innocence. \nPerceval cannot reply, his eyes affixed on the blood that trickles from Lancelot's hauberk. Lancelot raises his lance in salute to Gawain across the field. Gawain salutes in answer. \nThe two huge knights charge at each other, each man's spear tip making contact with the other's armor, and in the violent collision both are unhorsed. Lancelot is slower at getting to his feet and drawing his sword. \nHe is bleeding below the hauberk from his self-inflicted wound. \nIn the first onslaught Lancelot fights defensively, falling back. He has to toss aside his shield and hold his stomach with his shield hand. \nMorgana watches with Merlin. Every terrible blow of sword on sword reverberates through her body pleasurable. Merlin is captivated by her cruel sensuality. \nEXT. JOUSTING GROUND - LATE DAY \n", "test3_true": "SIR GAWAIN The Queen is innocent. I yield to your mercy, Sir Lancelot. \nLancelot collapses in a dead faint. \nINT. CELL, CAMELOT - EVENING \nEyes closed, Lancelot lies on a bed, naked but for a cloth across his loins. His minor wounds have been dressed, and Merlin is kneading the huge gash in his stomach, working the severed flesh together. Guenevere stands on one side of the bed, Arthur on the other, both looking down upon Lancelot, relieved and not daring to look at each other. \nMERLIN Flesh on flesh. You must press on the wound, Guenevere, hold it, and it will begin to bind. \nGuenevere kneels, and at her touch Lancelot's eyes flicker open. Merlin exits, and draws Arthur away with him. \nArthur is deeply tormented. \nARTHUR Merlin, tell me. Now that Guenevere is returned to me... \nMERLIN What is it my child? \nMerlin appears moved by the predicaments that Arthur has to face. \nARTHUR Will I have a son? \nMerlin stares off into the evening sky, where a lark sings high up. \nMERLIN Yes. \nARTHUR Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me. \nMERLIN A king should be afraid, always. The enemy is everywhere. Waiting in ambush in the dark corridors of his castle, on the deer paths of his forest, or in the gray and winding paths of a more tangled forest, in here. \nHe taps his skull and smiles. \nINT. CELL - EVENING \nLancelot is staring into Guenevere's eyes. She opens her shift, baring a breast with the innocence of a mother preparing to suckle a child. She presses her breast to his wound, her face to his chest, her arms enfolding him. She whispers. \nGUENEVERE Flesh on flesh. I will heal you. \nHis body trembles and his eyes brim with tears. He is lost. \nINT. HALL OF THE ROUND TABLE, CAMELOT - NIGHT \nThe court is assembled, for the evening feast. There is music and heavy drinking. Some knights are slouched across the table. Lancelot, still weak, takes his seat, looking at the drunken and frivolous knights. Arthur catches it, and they smile at each other. \nARTHUR They miss the battlefield. I think we do too. \nLANCELOT But one can still keep a sword sharp riding out in the name of the King's law. \nGuenevere cannot tear her eyes from Lancelot. He avoids her look. Arthur looks from Guenevere to Lancelot, and speaks softly to him, across her, and with stabbing directness. \nARTHUR It is not easy for the young ones to learn knightly virtues without the hard teaching of war and quest. It is only your example, Lancelot, that binds them now. \nThen, addressing the hall: \nARTHUR Which is the greatest quality of knighthood? Courage? Compassion? Loyalty? Humility? What do you say, Merlin? \nHe is bent close to Morgana, whispering. Only when the hall rings with laughter does he look up. \nMERLIN What? (then seeing he has an audience) The greatest? They blend together like the metals we mix to make a good sword. \nARTHUR I didn't ask for poetry. Which is it? \nMerlin looks from Arthur to Guenevere to Lancelot to Arthur. \nMERLIN All right. Truth. It must be truth, above all. When a man lies he murders some part of the world. \nAn uneasy silence falls upon the feast. Guenevere and Lancelot cannot look at each other, and Arthur feels it. Lancelot jumps to his feet. \nLANCELOT Conversation and court life don't suit me. I must take my rest in the forest. \nGuenevere stifles her dismay. \nARTHUR Hasn't Merlin mended your wound? \n", "test3_id": 551}

INT. DORM ­ NIGHT 
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF THEIR SLEEPING QUARTERS, AS THE MONKS FILE IN, LED BY THE D.S. 
A number of cots are lined up side by side. The D.S. has assigned a bed to each monk. Drew finds his bed, which is right next to Gao's. 
GAO 
I want another bed. 
D.S. 
Why? 
GAO (CONT'D) 
I won't sleep next to the American. D.S. We are no longer Chinese or Americans, Han or Mongol. We are Shaolin. Everyone is a monk. GAO (CONT'D) 
Well, this monk smells! Drew unconsciously smells himself. He shakes his head. Li goes up to the D.S. and points to the bed he was assigned. LI I will switch with Disciple Gao. 
D.S. nods, and then starts for the door. D.S. Go to sleep. No talking! We have an early day of training tomorrow. Gao collects his stuff and starts off to the new bed, hitting Drew with his shoulder. Drew trips him as he walks away, all done very secretively since the D.S. is watching. DREW Jerk! Li comes over to the new bed, and in silence they get climb into their respective beds. D.S. switches off the lights, then leaves, and Drew stares up at the ceiling. DREW (CONT'D) 
Thanks for what you did. 
LI 
Where are you from? 
DREW 
New York City. You? 
LI 
Beijing. What is New York like? 
DREW 
Amazing. I'll tell you about... 
GAO 
Shut UP! 
DREW Blow me! 
Drew waits for a moment, fearful that the D.S. will be coming back in. He doesn't. DREW (CONT'D) Good night, Li. 
LI Wan an. DISSOLVE TO: 
ANGLE ON DREW, SLEEPING All is quiet. 
Suddenly, a huge stick ENTERS FRAME, and it pauses for a moment above Drew, before THUMPING down on top of him. Drew cries out when he is hit, and jumps out of bed, looking all around him. No one is there. A few of the disciples are moving around because he yelled, but there is nothing else there. Drew, belatedly, gets into a fighting stance, but no other attack is coming. ANGLE ON GAO Who seems to be sleeping peacefully. ANGLE ON DREW As he climbs back into bed, bone-weary. He lies back down to sleep. INT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ MORNING 
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF LATRINE. 
Drew stumbles in, bleary-eyed,    to relieve himself. He stands at the urinal, relaxing as he starts.    Suddenly, a huge stick WHACKS Drew across the rear end, the SOUND    reverberating through the latrine. Drew yelps and jumps, looking    around for the attacker. 
No one is there, and his underwear is now all wet. 
INT. DINING ROOM ­ SAME DAY

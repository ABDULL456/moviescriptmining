{"test1_input": "Donald is on the porch, looking at a black clouds of smoke in the distance. The neighboring fields are BURNING. \nDONALD Nelson's burning up his crops. Found some of the blight on the okra. \nCooper watches the men walking through the fields, setting fire to the crop. \nCOOPER I thought okra wasn't susceptible. \nDONALD (SHRUGS) Better safe than sorry. (looks at him) You've got to take the boys to school. \nCOOPER Something wrong with your truck? \nDONALD (SMILES) Parent-teacher conference day. \nCooper bends his head in dismay. \nDONALD (CONT'D) Be nice to Murph's teacher. She's single, you know. \nCOOPER What does that have to do with anything? \nDONALD We're supposed to be repopulating the earth. Gotta pull your weight. Besides, the boys could do with a woman in their lives. \nThe boys run out of the house and pile into the truck. Cooper pulls away before Donald can continue. \nEXT. ROAD -- DAY \nCooper weaves the car along a dirt road. The kids are arguing over an ancient comic book in the back seat. \nCooper turns around to break it up. \nBANG -- one of the tires blows out in a foot-deep pothole. \nEXT. ROADSIDE -- DAY \nCooper examines the flattened tire. Looks at his older son. \nCOOPER Get the spare, Tom. \nTOM That is the spare. \nCOOPER All right. We'll use the patch kit. \nHe moves to the back of the truck. Murph suddenly looks very glum. \nMURPH I... I think the patch kit might not be there... (off his look) Because I was using it for my bike. \nCooper looks down at the dirt. Sighs. \nCOOPER Murph's law. \nMURPH (CONFUSED) What's that? \nTom snorts with laughter. Turns to his dad. \nTOM The kid doesn't even know what he was named after... \nCooper shoots Tom a look -- enough. \nTOM (CONT'D) Murph's law means what can go wrong will go wrong. \nMurph, looking hurt, walks off. Cooper turns to his son. \nCOOPER Find something to patch it with. \nTOM How am I supposed to do that? \nCOOPER Figure it out. I'm not always going to be here to help you. \nCooper leaves Tom to catch up with his younger son, who is looking out over the river. \nMURPH Is that really why I'm named Murph, dad? \nCOOPER Listen to me. Murph's law doesn't mean that. It means what can happen will happen. All kinds of things. Good or bad. And that's the way you want it to be. \nMURPH Why? \nCOOPER Because if nothing ever happened to you then you wouldn't learn anything. \nMurph is staring off into the distance. He's heard something. \nCOOPER (CONT'D) Murph? \nThen Cooper hears it, too. A LOW RUMBLING SOUND. Cooper looks out over the river. Then he turns back and tackles his son to the ground. \nSuddenly, a MASSIVE AIRPLANE SOARS overhead, so close they can almost touch it. It bounces the truck on its suspension, then soars off over the fields behind them. \nCooper grabs Murph and races back to the truck. He pulls a laptop and an antenna made out of a Pringles can out of the back of the truck. He hands the laptop and antenna to Murph. \nCOOPER (CONT'D) Get in. \nTom is still standing by the side of the road, wrestling with the jack. \nTOM What about the tire? \nINT. TRUCK -- MOMENTS LATER \nThe truck is SMASHING through the cornfields as fast as Cooper can push it on three good tires. \nMurph is hurriedly firing up the laptop and connecting it to the directional antenna. \nCooper is straining to see through the cornstalks, scanning the horizon. \nTOM OVER THERE- \nTo the right, the dark shape of the Russian drone appears, flying low over the fields. Cooper jerks the wheel-- \nEXT. RIVER -- DAY \nThe truck BURSTS out of the corn and SPLASHES across the river and into an old, abandoned suburban housing development in the valley below, planted over with corn. \nHalf a mile in front of them, the Russian drone is still hugging the ground. It has impossibly long, skinny wings, like an old U-2 surveillance plane, but no cockpit. The tops of its wings are covered in black solar cells. \nINT. TRUCK -- DAY \nMurph is fiddling with the computer. His older brother takes the computer from him and fires up emulation software. \nCOOPER It's a Chinese military drone. Solar cells could power an entire farm. (TO TOM) Take the wheel. \nCooper hands Murph the Pringles can antenna. \nCOOPER (CONT'D) Keep it pointed right at it, OK? \nMurph nods. Tom takes the wheel as his dad works the laptop, trying to communicate with the huge Russian drone. The screen fills with Cyrillic characters. \n", "test1_true": "Tom WEAVES the truck at speed through the old, curved streets of the development, past oversized suburban mansions planted over with corn. \nThey round a corner and come face-to-face with a robot harvester. Tom jerks the wheel to avoid it. \nBANG -- the truck loses a wing mirror against the flank of the combine. \nEXT. SUBURBAN DEVELOPMENT -- DAY \nTom guides the truck from street to street, trying to chart a straight path across the fields. The truck BOUNCES as it SMASHES through an old picket fence. \nAhead, the drone is soaring, banking, pulling away. \nINT. TRUCK -- DAY \nCooper is still trying to hack into the drone's control circuitry as they leave the development behind and begin to climb into the foothills of the Sierras. \nEXT. RIDGELINE, HILLS -- DAY \nTom guides the truck along the spine of the hills. The drone soars overhead, making for the white tips of the Sierras. \nINT. TRUCK -- DAY \nCooper is oblivious to the picturesque surroundings as he concentrates on the laptop. \nTOM (UNSURE) Dad? \nCOOPER Almost got it. Don't slow down. \nIn front of them, Tom and his brother watch as the drone plummets from view. \nTOM DAD. \nCooper looks up. Ahead, the trail disappears as the edge of the hills falls away -- it's a three hundred-foot drop. \nTom locks up the brakes. \nEXT. RIDGELINE, HILLS -- DAY \nThe truck skids to a halt inches from a precipitous drop. \nCooper climbs out, holding the laptop. Murph climbs out next to him, still pointing the Pringles can. \nTOM We lost it. \nCOOPER (SMILING) No we didn't. \nSuddenly, the drone SOARS back over them. Cooper types a couple keys and then moves his fingers across the trackpad. The huge drone banks and turns in response. \nAs the boys watch, Cooper sends the drone soaring high over them, banking and soaring along the tree-lined sides of the valley, light glinting from the black panels on its back. It's a beautiful sight. \nCooper crouches next to Murph. \nCOOPER (CONT'D) You want to give it a whirl? \nMurph looks at his dad, wide-eyed. He takes the laptop and moves his fingers gingerly across the pad. \nIn response, the massive plane banks into a tight turn in the valley below. \nFor a moment, Murph is in pure heaven, sending the drone dancing through the valley below. \nCOOPER (CONT'D) Set her down in the valley -- there, next to the river. \nMurph leads the plane in a figure eight and then begins guiding it into a gentle landing in the valley floor below. \nEXT. ABANDONED GOLF COURSE, VALLEY FLOOR -- DAY \nThe truck limps along the overgrown fairway of a long-defunct golf course towards the massive hulk of the Russian drone, \nCooper and the boys climb down. The valley is silent save for the truck's engine WHEEZING and SPUTTERING as it cools. \nCooper runs a hand over the smooth carbon flank of the drone. \nTOM How long do you think it's been up there, Dad? \nCOOPER Chinese mission control went down same as us, twenty years ago. It's been up there ever since. \nTOM What was it doing flying so low? \nCooper reads the information pouring into his laptop. \nCOOPER It was looking for something. Intercepted some kind of signal. (SHRUGS) It's been at eighty thousand feet. Sun probably cooked its brain. \nCooper runs his hand along the flank till he finds an access patch. He pulls out a crowbar and pries open the hatch. Inside, surrounded by a nest of liquid cooling tubes, is a small black module -- the drone's auto-pilot. \nCooper looks down at Murph, who is standing at his elbow. \nMURPH What are you going to do with it? \nCOOPER Reprogram it. Give it something socially responsible to do like drive a combine or a tractor. \nMURPH (QUIET) Couldn't we just let it go? It's not hurting anyone. \nCooper looks down at his son. Good kid. \nCOOPER We need all the help we can get, Murph. This thing has to adapt, just like the rest of us. \nCooper gently pries the control module out. \nEXT. COUNTY SCHOOL -- DAY \nIt's a small school, so all the kids and parents waiting in front know exactly who's driving the pickup truck with half of a Russian spy plane hanging out of the bed as it pulls up. \nINT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE, COUNTY SCHOOL -- DAY \nCooper is ushered into the office. The PRINCIPAL, 40s, an efficient-looking man, shakes his hand. \nPRINCIPAL Good to see you, Mr. Cooper. This is Ms. Kelly, Murph's teacher. \nCooper smiles at Ms. KELLY, 30s, attractive. \nPRINCIPAL (CONT'D) So we've gotten Tom's score back. Congratulations. He's going to make an excellent farmer. \nThe principal slides a carbon copy across the desk to Cooper, who looks taken aback. \nCOOPER What about college? \nPRINCIPAL The University of California only accepts a few hundred students a year, Mr. Cooper. You have to be realistic. \nCOOPER You're ruling out college for him now? He's only fifteen. \nPRINCIPAL I'm sorry. I'm afraid Tom's score simply isn't high enough. \n", "test1_id": 2259, "test2_input": "BRAND I've got you. \nCreatures begin splashing down into the pool behind them, as if imitating them. \nCooper stumbles to his feet and Brand guides them backward into a small cave carved into the rock above the pool. \nINT. CAVE -- NIGHT \nBrand CRACKS a glow stick, basking the cave around them in a soft light. \nAs they watch, horrified, the pool and the rocks in front of the cave fill up with creatures of all sizes, as they tumble down the hill in what appears to be a battle royal. \nFor a moment, it looks like Brand and Cooper may go unnoticed. Then, a three-foot-tall creature with a dozen legs creeps its way toward the entrance to the cave. Another follows, and another, until the cave entrance is full. \nCooper looks around the cave, frantic. He picks up a rock. Brand, scared but still thinking, takes the rock from his hand and drops it back to the ground. \nBRAND It's game theory. The best move is always to cooperate at first. \nCOOPER By \"cooperate\" do you mean let it eat me? \nBRAND These organisms have no interest in us. They survive by photosynthesis. All they need is light. \nCOOPER Then why are they killing each other? \nBRAND I don't know. (LOOKS AROUND) But we're outnumbered, Cooper. So unless you have a better idea, I suggest we make nice. \nThe creatures move toward them hesitantly, then faster. \nCooper stands stock still as the creatures gather around him. Several of them join up into bigger animals to get a better look at him. \nOne of them wraps itself around his chest and begins prodding at his shoulders, then his neck. \nCOOPER (trying to be calm) What is it doing? \nBRAND It's a colony organism. It's trying to incorporate you into its structure. \nCOOPER I don't want it to incorporate me. \nBRAND Don't open your mouth. \nCOOPER WHY N- \nAs he speaks, the creature on his chest extends four spindly, pointed feelers and reaches gently into his mouth. \nCooper holds his breath as the organism taps against his teeth. Its skin has a roughened texture, as if incomplete, and it appears to be searching for the same texture on Cooper's skin, without much luck. \nBored, the life-forms climb back down off of Cooper. The last two creatures link up in an imitation of Cooper's lower body and attempt to walk across the room like a human. After a moment, the creatures tumble to the ground and flail away. \nCooper is still breathing hard as the cave empties and he and Brand are left alone again. \nBrand steps to the edge of the cave and watches, fascinated, as the creatures resume wrestling and battling each other. \nCOOPER (CONT'D) They're killing each other. \nBRAND No. They don't bleed... they don't die... they're just competing... trying out different shapes, looking for the best one. \nCooper watches as a hideously-awkward-looking, five-legged beast stumbles past and tackles another animal. \nCOOPER I'd say they have a long way to go. \nBRAND (AMAZED) They do this every night. \nAs they watch, a two-foot-long creature with one huge claw scuttles along the ground, grabbing smaller opponents and smashing them apart, then sorting through the wreckage and adopting some of the writhing parts as its own. \nSomething about the movement is endearing, the way it experiments with each piece -- less like a massacre and more like an over-caffeinated self-assembling erector set. \nSuddenly, a massive, lumbering creature SMASHES down in front of the claw beast. No match, the smaller creature turns to scuttle away. Too slow. The larger organism brings one club-like limb smashing down on top of it. After a moment, it lifts its claw -- the two animals have become one. \nThe new organism lumbers away through the jungle, happily snapping its new claw at larger opponents. \nBRAND (CONT'D) The behavior changes as the animals get bigger and bigger. More sophisticated. More calculated. \nTwo of the larger organisms square off, circling each other, lights pulsing up and down their bodies in a fierce display. \nCOOPER But what are they competing for? \nBRAND I don't know. \nBrand shivers -- it's getting colder. \nINT. CAVE -- NIGHT \nBrand and Cooper huddle around a small chemical fire they've brought with them. \nBrand looks at the sample of the fractal wildlife in her case. It's moving around, splitting apart, reforming, trying to find a way out. \nBRAND These creatures are billions of years older than we are. But they're relatively primitive. They haven't developed tools, culture, language. \nCOOPER Why not? \nBRAND I don't know. No one knows how intelligent life began on Earth. But the surface of this planet has virtually no craters. No impacts. It's been sheltered by the local black holes. \nCOOPER What difference would that make? \nBRAND Maybe not enough has gone wrong here. Maybe bad luck is the key to intelligent life. \nCOOPER (QUIETLY) Murph's Law. \nBRAND Exactly. Maybe our interaction with them will push them over the top. Maybe that's part of the plan. \nCOOPER (shakes his head) The plan. \nBRAND Why is it so hard for you to accept that someone might be trying to help us? \nCooper is silent for a moment. His mood darkens. \nCOOPER I was in Denver during the first year of the famine. I was just a kid. We kept waiting for someone to come help us. People starved to death sitting on the ground, waiting for someone to come. (MORE) \nCOOPER (CONT'D) (looks at her) I only made it because I realized that nobody was coming to save us. We were on our own. \nCooper looks away. The memories are never that far away. \nCOOPER (CONT'D) Honestly? After the things I saw... you want to know why I don't believe that someone would be trying to help us? Because I'm not sure we're worth saving. \nThey sit in silence for a while. \nEXT. CAVE -- NIGHT \nCooper sleeps. After a moment, Brand steps back out into the darkness. \nEXT. PLAIN -- DAWN \nBrand exhales great streams of frosted breath -- the temperature is well below freezing. The first flickers of light are visible in the ice above. \n", "test2_true": "Just as the beast reaches the top, it freezes, as if stuck. \nAbove, the ice begins to shine brighter and brighter. \nSuddenly, the beast on top breaks apart, unfurling into planes to catch the light. This is what the contest has been about -- a better place in the sun. \nBrand takes it in. \nEXT. JUNGLE -- DAY \nCooper and Brand pick their way their way through the foliage, which is now perfectly still, absorbing the light. Cooper looks at the plants, wary. \nBrand sees his trepidation and laughs at him. \nBRAND They're not going to move now, Cooper. They need to spread themselves as thin as they can to absorb the light. \nCooper leads the way, pushing through the trees. \nSuddenly he stops again. Brand, annoyed, pushes through the foliage to join him. \nBRAND (CONT'D) Cooper, honestly, you're a bit of a- \nShe stops. Cooper is standing at a sheer cliff. \nSpread out on the plain below is a massive, fortified base. \nINT. CHINESE FORTIFIED COLONY -- DAY \nMassive blast doors, long since smashed in, open onto a building that has been overrun by the local fractal wildlife. \nCase steps inside first, his worklights flickering on. Cooper and the others follow him in. \nINT. MESS HALL, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY \nThe room is barely recognizable -- the fractal life has covered the tables and chairs. Water pools on the floor and light streams in from a massive hole the fractal animals have punched in the ceiling. \nDOYLE Looks like the Chinese picked a fight with the locals. \nCOOPER Looks like they lost. \nThey continue through the ruins. \nINT. BARRACKS, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY \nThe deeper they go, the less fractal wildlife they find. The barracks are pristine -- hundreds of perfectly made beds, waiting for colonists who never came, like one of the bunkers the federal government used to keep in case of nuclear winter. \nDOYLE Look at the size of this place. They built it for thousands of people. But no one came. \nBrand looks around, determined. \nBRAND They will. We can salvage it. This place will save us years. \nCOOPER But why didn't they come? \nBRAND (SHRUGS) The Chinese government collapsed, same as ours. The people who knew about this mission probably died years ago. We had the same problems. \nRoth finds a sign he likes the look of -- it points to the science levels. \nINT. LABORATORY, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY \nA massive door GRINDS open and the team steps into a massive complex of underground laboratories. \nINT. DAMAGED LAB, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY \nCooper and the others carefully make their way through a lab that has been completely emptied -- no desks, no chairs, nothing. The only thing that remains is a solid ball of matter in the center of the room. \nBRAND What happened here? \nRoth stares at the ball, intrigued. \nROTH They were testing something. \nCooper looks at the walls, which are bowed inwards. \nCOOPER Testing what? \nRoth is looking at the ball, which appears to have been built from layers of different material. The outermost layer is flattened steel. \nCOOPER (CONT'D) (LOOKING CLOSER) Is that a chair? \nRoth looks. The outermost layer of the ball indeed looks like a steel chair, flattened with incredible force onto surface of the ball. \nBrand opens the door to the next lab. \nINT. LABORATORY, CHINESE COLONY -- NIGHT \nThe lab is empty, except for a large metal sphere on a pedestal in the center of the room. A black box is set into a cavity in the sphere, wired to a control panel. \nCooper looks at the walls of the room, which have been bowed inwards, as if some great force had been pulling from the center of the room. \nCOOPER Everything in here is bolted down. (looks at sphere) What do you think this thing does? \nROTH (EXCITED) Let's find out. \nRoth finds a control panel. Wipes off an inch of dust and begins tinkering with the controls. \nCOOPER I wouldn't turn it on until we can figure out what it does, Roth. \nRoth continues to look over the controls, oblivious. \nBRAND (O.S.) Cooper. Come look at this. \nBrand calls out from the hallway. \nINT. STAIRWELL, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY \nCooper follows Brand's voice down the stairs to a sub-basement beneath the lab level. \nINT. OBSERVATORY, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY \nCooper steps into a huge space filled with a near perfect holographic representation of the local system. \nCooper joins Brand and Doyle in the map, looking at the incredibly detailed models of each star. \nCase is standing at a terminal, hacking into the camp's records. \nCASE I've found the Chinese mission logs. They're encrypted. \nCooper walks over. Looks over the terminal. \nCOOPER Old military-grade encryption. It's not very robust. (looks at Case) No offense. Hang on. \n", "test2_id": 2260, "test3_input": "As his senses flicker in and out, he is struck with memories of his boys, so vivid he reaches out for them, crawling forward in the snow. \nHe stops, and laughs, remembering what Case told him about what happens when humans die. \nHe struggles to his feet and stumbles a few more feet, eventually coming to rest just steps from the ship. \nCooper takes a final step. Finally, he collapses under his ship, as the wind continues to HOWL around him. \nAs the snow clears for a moment, Cooper is alone on a vast arctic tundra. He will die alone. \nBLACK \nFADE IN: \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY \nCooper wakes. \nHe is in a sunlit room. A breeze rustles the curtains as it makes its way in through a large open window. \nCooper sits up. As he a does, a control panel on the wall TONES gently, as if in response to his movement. \nHe stands and looks around. He can see sunlight through the open windows and hear people -- kids YELLING as they play. He moves toward the window. Reaches for the curtains. Before he can, the door opens behind him. \nA WOMAN in a white coat steps in, smiling warmly. \nDOCTOR Good morning. Don't go outside just yet, Mr. Cooper. (MORE) \nDOCTOR (CONT'D) (offers him a pill) This will help with the disorientation. \nCooper opens his mouth to talk, but his voice is cracked. He gives up. Swallows the pill. \nDOCTOR (CONT'D) Wait a minute for that to take effect. It can be a bit of an adjustment. (looks him over) You had some frostbite. Nothing too serious. \nAs she talks, Cooper looks past her to the window. \nCOOPER Where am I? \nDOCTOR (SMILES) It's a bit of a coincidence, really. When the rangers found you, we were the nearest facility. \nCOOPER What's coincidence? What is this place? \nDOCTOR We have a lot to show you. \nThe doctor reaches for the curtains. She offers him a hand. Cooper declines the help and steps outside. \nEXT. HOSPICE, COOPER STATION -- DAY \nCooper is standing on a rooftop deck of a four-story building in a medium-sized city surrounded by fields. But as the road and the buildings stretch into the distance, the landscape curves up, not down. \nThe entire landscape is contained within a huge cylinder- shaped space station. \nCooper stumbles, and reaches instinctively out. The doctor catches him. \nDOCTOR You're OK. We get this from people who move here from planetary colonies all the time. \nCOOPER Where... where are we? \nDOCTOR Like I said. It was a coincidence. There was a facility closer to Earth, but they had a problem, so you wound up here. (off his look) This is the Space Station Joseph A. Cooper. \nCooper takes in the incredible surroundings. A thousand feet above them, black specks are sprinkled over an ocean of green -- Jersey milking cows grazing in a field of wild grass. \nDOCTOR (CONT'D) I've got someone who wants to meet you. \nCooper looks at her. \nINT. INTENSIVE CARE ROOM, HOSPICE, COOPER STATION -- DAY \nCooper steps inside. The room is dark, still, the only noise is the labored RATTLE of an old man struggling to breathe. \nCooper steps closer to the bed. The man's skin is paper- thin. He is ancient. \nDOCTOR He was moved here after they found you. He's a little old for a transfer, but they made an exception. \nCooper hovers at the back of the room, unsure. He turns to the doctor, questioning. Then he notices the pictures on the old man's desk: \nThere are dozens of them. Children, grandchildren. Then the older ones -- the man's own parents. Grandparents. Cooper spots a tiny framed picture with someone he recognizes: \nMurph, 80 years old, surrounded by his daughter and her family. They are standing in front of a re-opened Cape Canaveral, and a huge spaceship under construction. \nCooper picks up the picture and stares at it. \nThe doctor points to a shy little boy hiding behind Murph's leg in the picture. \nDOCTOR (CONT'D) That's him. \nShe points to the old man lying in the bed. \nDOCTOR (CONT'D) His name is Anthony Welling. Anthony Cooper Welling. (SMILES) He's your great great grandson. He's been waiting a long time for you. \nCooper's eyes well with tears. He steps over to the bed and looks down at the ancient man, teetering on the edge of death. \nThe old man looks at him, eyes widening in excitement. He strains, trying to reach the bedside table. He's trying to reach the drawer. Cooper helps him open it. \nInside is a simple, familiar wristwatch. The old man carefully takes out the watch. He gives the watch a few winds and, hands shaking, offers it to Cooper. \nCooper, eyes filling with tears, closes his hand over the old man's hand, enveloping both the watch and the man's hand. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CORNFIELD, COOPER STATION -- MORNING \nCooper is sitting in a well-appointed office. A middle-aged BUREAUCRAT smiles at him from the far side of a huge desk. \nADMINISTRATOR You're a hero, Mr. Cooper. Let's just start off by saying that. It's an incredible and... unexpected honor to have you here with us. \nCooper smiles, uncomfortable. \nADMINISTRATOR (CONT'D) None of us would be here without the efforts of you and the other crewmembers of the Endurance. (smiles, unconvincingly) So I don't want you to take this the wrong way. But there are some questions I've been told to ask. \nThe man looks petrified, like he's been instructed to grill George Washington on his expense reports. \nCOOPER Shoot. \nADMINISTRATOR The rangers who found you reported that you had released a sample of an alien life-form into the wild. Which is, unfortunately, against regulations. \nCOOPER It was last of its kind. Their planet was destroyed. \nThe administrator cues up a series of images on his computer. \nADMINISTRATOR The rangers attempted to isolate the life-form, but it had already spread out of control. It seems to be thriving. \nHe shows Cooper a satellite image of north america. A considerable portion of the frozen tundra is glowing. \n", "test3_true": "ADMINISTRATOR (CONT'D) Can you tell me why you... elected to release the life-form back on earth? \nCooper is still laughing. \nCOOPER Because that was the plan. \nADMINISTRATOR Whose plan? \nCOOPER (SMILES) I don't know. \nThe administrator tries to smile back. Makes a few notes in his file. Changes the subject. \nADMINISTRATOR My assistant tells me you've applied for a position with the exploration fleet. \nCOOPER Feel like I should be pulling my weight. \nADMINISTRATOR That's admirable, Mr. Cooper. The truth is, most of the fleet's personnel are automated. There are a small number of crewed ships. But there are great numbers of candidates. Very well trained candidates. \nCOOPER I was hoping to enroll in a course. Try to get myself up to speed on the new systems. \nADMINISTRATOR I don't want you to take this the wrong way, Mr. Cooper -- like I said, you're a hero. But the truth is we have somewhat limited resources. \nCooper remembers this conversation. He looks down. \nCOOPER No one's heard anything from Brand? \nADMINISTRATOR I'm sorry. Officially, she's been listed as missing for over 200 years. Mind you, I guess you turned up eventually, didn't you? \nCOOPER Am I really going to hurt anybody by going to look for her? I just need a small ship. I made a promise. \nThe bureaucrat looks down. Is he really going to have to tell this guy the lay of the land? \nADMINISTRATOR Listen. Mr. Cooper. You're a hero. You're the oldest man in the human race. Don't you want to take it easy? (off his look) I hope you understand, we all you hold you in the highest possible regard. (QUIET) Which is why they're never going to let you go off by yourself in a spaceship. I'm sorry. \nCooper looks at his hands. He's got a couple centuries on the bureaucrat in Earth years, but looks ten years younger. He puts his hands in his pockets. \nADMINISTRATOR (CONT'D) I've got some good news, however. (BIG SMILE) We all know about your early life, Mr Cooper. I wrote a paper on it when I was a boy. And I think we found something you'll really enjoy. \nEXT. CORNFIELD, COOPER STATION -- DAY \nCorn blows in an artificial breeze. A red tractor makes its way through the field, which curves gently up in the distance. \nADMINISTRATOR (V.O.) The machines do most of the work, of course, but we were able to get you a few acres. You're going to be a farmer again. \nAfter a moment, the tractor stops. Cooper climbs down from the seat. Looks at the front steering linkage, which is jammed with an errant tree branch. He wipes his forehead and begins working the branch out of the machine. \nHe looks miserable. \nA robot, a similar unit to Tars, walks over. Offers Cooper a bottle of water. Cooper accepts it. \nEXT. HANGAR BAY, COOPER STATION \nCooper stands on an observation deck, high above the hangar floor. Below him, bright young things in uniforms climb into sleek-looking spaceships and prepare to set out. \nEXT. BASEBALL DIAMOND, COOPER STATION \nCooper sits in the stands, listening to the familiar crack of the bat as an intramural team from the university practices. \nCooper watches. He looks bored. \nThe kid up to bat cracks a pop fly. For a second, the catcher shuffles back and forth, trying to get himself into position. But the ball never returns. The catcher YELLS out a warning. \nAbove, the ball begins to slowly fall up, not down, toward the town center above. \nAfter a second, the ball smashes through a skylight of a building high above them. \nCooper watches as the kid rounds the bases, laughing. \nINT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE, COOPER STATION -- DAY \nCooper's robot sits at the kitchen table. Cooper is fiddling around in the back of his head. \nROBOT Settings: general settings, security SETTINGS-- \nCOOPER Curiosity. New level setting. 100 percent. \nROBOT Confirmed. Would you like to make any additional changes? \nCOOPER Sense of humor. New level setting. 100 percent. Wait. (THINKS) 80 percent. \nHe begins putting the robot back together. \nEXT. FARMHOUSE, COOPER STATION -- TWILIGHT \nCooper sits on his porch, joined by the same robot as before. They watch as the space station rotates lazily out of alignment with the local star, casting the inside of the cylinder into shade, then darkness. \nThe shadow races past them. Another day. Another night. \nEXT. HANGAR, COOPER STATION \nA maintenance worker finishes looking over one of the sleek- looking spacecraft. He packs up his tools and heads out. \nAfter a moment, two figures pick their way across the hangar floor, sticking to the shadows. \nAs they reach the first ship in the line, we get a better look. It's Cooper and his robot pal. The robot is wearing a baseball cap and carrying a toolbox. \nCooper gestures to the robot, who sets down the toolbox with a click against the mirror-like floor. \nCooper shakes his head, annoyed, at the robot, and puts his finger to his lips. The robot nods, bashful. \nCooper waves a small handheld computer near the skin of the ship until it lights up. Then he punches in a few codes. Nothing happens.

{"train": "INTERSTELLAR \nWritten by \nJonathan Nolan \nSTORY BY \nJonathan Nolan, Kip Thorne & Lynda Obst \nMARCH 12 2008 \nSPACE. \nBut not the dark lonely corner of it we're used to. This is a glittering inferno -- the center of a distant galaxy. \nSuddenly, something TEARS past at incredible speed: a NEUTRON STAR. It SMASHES headlong through everything it encounters... planets, stars. Can anything stop this juggernaut? \nYes. Something looms at the heart of the galaxy, hidden inside the blinding starlight, a dark flaw in the fabric of existence itself: a BLACK HOLE. \nThe neutron star is pulled into the black hole's swirl, spiraling closer and closer to destruction. Finally, it contacts the hole's edge and EXPLODES. \nThe EXPLOSION is so powerful that it sends shock waves into the fabric of space-time itself. We ride one of these waves, racing back out from the black hole. \nSuddenly, a portion of the wave disappears down a crystal- like hole, emerging in a much darker region of the universe -- a backwater that, as the wave races past a giant red planet with a distinctive eye, we recognize as our own. \nThe wave, now just an infinitesimal ripple, finally reaches our blue planet. It drops into our atmosphere over North America, toward the high desert east of the Cascades, and through the roof of a nondescript warehouse. \nThe wave tickles the atoms in the steel shell of a vacuum chamber, then dances a tiny jig with a laser beam reflected in a heavy piece of glass. \nThe wave shoots back out of the building and disappears in the fractal branches of a tumbleweed resting against a concrete tube that stretches for miles in the desert. \nAn SUV speeds past the tumbleweed and we follow it till it parks at another plain-looking building at the opposite end of the tube. A MAN climbs out of the SUV. \nINT. CONTROL ROOM, WAREHOUSE -- DAY \nThe man lets himself into a large room that looks like Mission Control. He pours himself a cup of coffee. It is the weekend and the place is empty. No one has been there to see the displays flashing a distinctive shape -- a pulse followed by a series of echoes. \nThe man looks up at the screen, then DROPS his cup of coffee. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LIGO OFFICES, CALTECH, PASADENA -- DAY \nThe Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory headquarters at Caltech is a frenzy of activity. POSTDOCS and RESEARCHERS huddle around monitors and printouts, arguing. \nANSEN, 60s, the director of LIGO, walks through the frenzy. A postdoc hands him a printout: a pulse followed by echoes. \nINT. LIGO DIRECTOR'S OFFICE, CALTECH -- DAY \nAnsen steps into the relative calm of a large, sunlit office, which overlooks a grassy stretch of Caltech's campus. \nHis ASSISTANT, 30s, is on the phone, on hold. He looks up at Ansen as he enters. \nASSISTANT I'm on hold with the INS. (COVERS MICROPHONE) Don't you think we should double check the triangulation before we CALL ANYBODY- \nANSEN We have double checked it. \nSomeone finally picks up the line. \nASSISTANT Yes. I'm trying to reach- (pause, listens) No, I don't think you understand how serious this is. (PAUSE) Because if you did, we'd be having this conversation in person. \nHe listens for a moment, then hangs up the phone, confused. \nANSEN What did they say? \nASSISTANT They said we should look out the window. \nAnsen steps to the window and looks out: \nIn the courtyard below, coeds are scrambling to get out of the way as a military helicopter sets down in the middle of the quad and dozens of ARMED FEDERAL AGENTS converge on his building. \nINT. MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM, LIGO, CALTECH -- DAY \nAnsen sits, alone, on one side of a conference table. \nThe other side is filled with GOVERNMENT MEN -- NSA mostly, some DIA. The door opens and his assistant steps in. Armed guards pat him down, then shove him into a seat. \nANSEN Is that really necessary? \nOne of the NSA agents leans forward. \nNSA AGENT You've been complaining for years that the government doesn't take your project seriously enough, Doctor. (SMILES) You can't have it both ways. \nAnsen motions to his assistant, who turns on a projector. On-screen, we see the familiar pulse and echoes. \nANSEN Yesterday morning, our facility in Hanford identified this signal: a neutron star colliding with a supermassive black hole. We went through the last year's data and triangulated the source. \nThe pulse is translated into a crude animatic of a neutron star circling into the black hole. \nNSA AGENT We know that, Doctor. What we don't know is why, according to your numbers, this event took place right here in our own solar system. \nSuddenly, the image overlays the sun, the earth, and the rest of our solar system around the black hole. \nANSEN It didn't. Because if it had we'd all be dead by now. \nOn-screen, Jupiter, then the Earth and the inner planets are consumed by the black hole. Only the sun survives, pulled into orbit around its new master. \nANSEN (CONT'D) Which leaves only one explanation: The signal traveled through a (MORE) \nANSEN (CONT'D) wormhole. A gateway to a distant corner of the universe. The black hole is on the far side. \nOn-screen, the black hole system is removed to a distant corner, connected to ours by a tunnel through space-time. A gravity wave from the collision travels through the tunnel. \nNSA AGENT I've read your book, Doctor. You said that wormholes are impossible. \nANSEN There is nothing quite as satisfying as being proved utterly wrong. (SMILES) I said that a wormhole couldn't exist naturally. Not for more than a few billionths of a second. It would have to be... stabilized. \nNSA AGENT Stabilized by what? \nAnsen pauses, unsure. His assistant steps in to his defense. \nASSISTANT We don't have any way to answer that question. \nNSA AGENT (IGNORES HIM) You're not under peer review here, Doctor. I don't care about your reputation. I need to know how that thing got there. Now. \nAnsen finally speaks up. \nANSEN If you're worried about an invasion, I would start drafting the articles of surrender. (SMILES) Whoever they are, if they can build a wormhole, they could erase us in the blink of an eye. Luckily, that also means we have nothing they could be interested in. \nNSA AGENT Then why is it there? \nANSEN I don't know. Maybe it's an invitation. A chance to commune with an advanced species. \nDonald is on the porch, looking at a black clouds of smoke in the distance. The neighboring fields are BURNING. \nDONALD Nelson's burning up his crops. Found some of the blight on the okra. \nCooper watches the men walking through the fields, setting fire to the crop. \nCOOPER I thought okra wasn't susceptible. \nDONALD (SHRUGS) Better safe than sorry. (looks at him) You've got to take the boys to school. \nCOOPER Something wrong with your truck? \nDONALD (SMILES) Parent-teacher conference day. \nCooper bends his head in dismay. \nDONALD (CONT'D) Be nice to Murph's teacher. She's single, you know. \nCOOPER What does that have to do with anything? \nDONALD We're supposed to be repopulating the earth. Gotta pull your weight. Besides, the boys could do with a woman in their lives. \nThe boys run out of the house and pile into the truck. Cooper pulls away before Donald can continue. \nEXT. ROAD -- DAY \nCooper weaves the car along a dirt road. The kids are arguing over an ancient comic book in the back seat. \nCooper turns around to break it up. \nBANG -- one of the tires blows out in a foot-deep pothole. \nEXT. ROADSIDE -- DAY \nCooper examines the flattened tire. Looks at his older son. \nCOOPER Get the spare, Tom. \nTOM That is the spare. \nCOOPER All right. We'll use the patch kit. \nHe moves to the back of the truck. Murph suddenly looks very glum. \nMURPH I... I think the patch kit might not be there... (off his look) Because I was using it for my bike. \nCooper looks down at the dirt. Sighs. \nCOOPER Murph's law. \nMURPH (CONFUSED) What's that? \nTom snorts with laughter. Turns to his dad. \nTOM The kid doesn't even know what he was named after... \nCooper shoots Tom a look -- enough. \nTOM (CONT'D) Murph's law means what can go wrong will go wrong. \nMurph, looking hurt, walks off. Cooper turns to his son. \nCOOPER Find something to patch it with. \nTOM How am I supposed to do that? \nCOOPER Figure it out. I'm not always going to be here to help you. \nCooper leaves Tom to catch up with his younger son, who is looking out over the river. \nMURPH Is that really why I'm named Murph, dad? \nCOOPER Listen to me. Murph's law doesn't mean that. It means what can happen will happen. All kinds of things. Good or bad. And that's the way you want it to be. \nMURPH Why? \nCOOPER Because if nothing ever happened to you then you wouldn't learn anything. \nMurph is staring off into the distance. He's heard something. \nCOOPER (CONT'D) Murph? \nThen Cooper hears it, too. A LOW RUMBLING SOUND. Cooper looks out over the river. Then he turns back and tackles his son to the ground. \nSuddenly, a MASSIVE AIRPLANE SOARS overhead, so close they can almost touch it. It bounces the truck on its suspension, then soars off over the fields behind them. \nCooper grabs Murph and races back to the truck. He pulls a laptop and an antenna made out of a Pringles can out of the back of the truck. He hands the laptop and antenna to Murph. \nCOOPER (CONT'D) Get in. \nTom is still standing by the side of the road, wrestling with the jack. \nTOM What about the tire? \nINT. TRUCK -- MOMENTS LATER \nThe truck is SMASHING through the cornfields as fast as Cooper can push it on three good tires. \nMurph is hurriedly firing up the laptop and connecting it to the directional antenna. \nCooper is straining to see through the cornstalks, scanning the horizon. \nTOM OVER THERE- \nTo the right, the dark shape of the Russian drone appears, flying low over the fields. Cooper jerks the wheel-- \nEXT. RIVER -- DAY \nThe truck BURSTS out of the corn and SPLASHES across the river and into an old, abandoned suburban housing development in the valley below, planted over with corn. \nHalf a mile in front of them, the Russian drone is still hugging the ground. It has impossibly long, skinny wings, like an old U-2 surveillance plane, but no cockpit. The tops of its wings are covered in black solar cells. \nINT. TRUCK -- DAY \nMurph is fiddling with the computer. His older brother takes the computer from him and fires up emulation software. \nCOOPER It's a Chinese military drone. Solar cells could power an entire farm. (TO TOM) Take the wheel. \nCooper hands Murph the Pringles can antenna. \nCOOPER (CONT'D) Keep it pointed right at it, OK? \nMurph nods. Tom takes the wheel as his dad works the laptop, trying to communicate with the huge Russian drone. The screen fills with Cyrillic characters. \nCOOPER What are you, about a 36-inch waist? (BEAT) 30-inch inseam? \nPRINCIPAL I'm not sure I see-- \nCOOPER You're telling me you need two numbers to measure your own ass, but just one to measure my son's future? \nMs. Kelly stifles a laugh, then, with a look from the principal, takes on the appropriate look of offense. \nPRINCIPAL I understand you're a well-educated man, Mr. Cooper. A scientist? \nCOOPER Engineer. \nPRINCIPAL Frankly, the world doesn't need any more engineers. We didn't run out of trains or television sets or satellites. (BEAT) We ran out of food. \nCooper leans back. He's not going to win this one. \nPRINCIPAL (CONT'D) The world needs farmers, Mr. Cooper. And I'm sure your son Tom is going to make a fine one. (SMILES BENIGNLY) We're a caretaker generation. But things are getting better. Maybe your grandchildren will be able to attend college. \nCooper looks down, swallowing his anger. \nCOOPER Are we done? \nPRINCIPAL One more thing. Ms. Kelly here says that Murph brought a book to school about the lunar landings. \nHe slides an old textbook with a picture of a rocket on the cover across the desk to Cooper. \nCOOPER One of my old textbooks. Murph liked the pictures. \nMS. KELLY This is one of the old federal textbooks. We've replaced them with corrected versions. \nCOOPER Corrected? \nMS. KELLY The new textbooks explain that the Apollo lunar missions were faked in order to bankrupt the Soviet Union. \nCOOPER You don't believe we went to the moon? \nMS. KELLY I believe it was a brilliant piece of propaganda. The Soviets spent years trying to build rockets and other useless machines. \nCOOPER \"Useless machines\"? \nCooper looks to the Principal for help. None is forthcoming. \nMS. KELLY Yes, Mr. Cooper. The kind of wastefulness and excess that the 20th century represented. Your children would be better off learning about this planet, rather than reading fantasies about leaving it. \nCooper is silent for a long moment. \nCOOPER One of those useless machines they used to make was called an MRI. If we had any of them left the doctors might have been able to find the cyst in my wife's brain before she died, rather than afterwards. And then my kids could have been raised by two parents, instead of me and their pain-in-the-ass grandfather. \nMs. Kelly's face falls, ashen. Cooper swallows his anger. Most of it, anyway. \nCOOPER (CONT'D) You ever consider the best thing for the world and humanity might have been for us to part company? \nCooper gets up to leave. \nINT. TRUCK, COUNTY SCHOOL PARKING LOT -- DAY \nCooper climbs into the truck, trying to hold it together. He PUNCHES the wheel. \nThe radio KEYS to life. He ignores it. Sits for a moment in misery. Finally he picks up the handset. \nCB OPERATOR (O.S.) Got a call from Riggs, down in Galveston. Says some of the tractors you built him went haywire last night. \nCOOPER Just tell him to power down the controllers for a couple minutes. \nCB OPERATOR (O.S.) I did. He wants you to come down in person anyway. Says he found something you should take a look at. \nCooper stares at the wheel. Shakes his head in frustration. \nEXT. AIRSTRIP -- DAY \nCooper pulls his truck up to a grimy-looking hangar. Pulls a tarp off of an ancient Piper Cub. Checks it over. \nINT. PIPER CUB -- DAY \nCooper guides the plane along a long sliver of deserted beach. The radio crackles to life. \nCOOPER Bravo-two-eight, requesting permission to enter your airspace. \nAIR TRAFFIC CONTROL (O.S.) Permission granted. Welcome to the sovereign nation of Texas. \nCoop hangs up the radio. Banks the plane inland. \nEXT. GULF COAST -- DAY \nBelow, a combine harvester fights its way up the dunes, trying to reach the beach, its wheels struggling for traction in the soft sand. \nA MAN waves up at Cooper's plane as it circles overhead. \nCooper lands the plane on a deserted roadway. Jumps down. \nHe intercepts one of the combines as it trundles past, trying to reach the dunes. He pops open the cabin. \nInside is a mess of wires hooked into an auto-pilot not unlike the one he ripped out of the drone. He checks the fault code and resets the computer. \nThe man jogs over to meet him. \nRIGGS Thanks for coming down. Half of 'em took off last night, looking for something. (points to dunes) Looks like they found it, too. I thought you were the man to see it. \nRiggs starts walking up the dune. Cooper follows. \nBelow, on the beach, a dozen more combines and other farming vehicles are lined up at the tideline, warm gulf water lapping at their metal flanks. They are circling a deep crater. \nAs they watch, an ancient autonomous SUB BEACHES itself, trying to reach the crater. \nEXT. CRATER'S EDGE, BEACH -- DAY \nCooper steps between the waiting machines and peers down into the crater. \nAt the very bottom is a ROUND BLACK BALL, about a foot across -- the same object we saw punch a hole in the side of a satellite. Every few seconds, it emits a distinctive CHIRP. \nCooper checks his rad meter. A tiny reading -- non-lethal. He takes off his watch and hands it to Riggs. Then he slides down into the hole. \nThe probe CHIRPS as Cooper slides down on top of it. He rubs a hand across its smooth composite bulk. \nRIGGS (FROM ABOVE) You think it's an alien? \nCooper wipes sand off of the object, revealing the faint, familiar outline etched into the side of the probe: \nThe stars and stripes of the old federal government. \nCOOPER Not exactly. \nEXT. CRATER'S EDGE, BEACH -- DAY \nMURPH Try a different direction. \nAs they roll the probe in a circle, its SHRIEK stops, then picks up again. Cooper zeroes in on the direction that keeps it quiet -- southwest -- and pushes it along in the dirt. \nCOOPER It's a fail-safe. It's going to annoy us into taking it home. \nCooper stops rolling the probe and, after a moment, it begins SHRIEKING again. \nTOM What are we going to do? \nCooper gets a rope. \nCOOPER We're going to get some sleep. \nHe begins tying the rope around the probe. \nINT. BEDROOM, COOPER'S HOUSE -- DAY \nCooper wakes. He's been sleeping with a pillow wrapped around his head. The SHRIEK can be heard, but it's muffled, distant. \nINT. KITCHEN, COOPER'S HOUSE -- DAY \nTom heads off for school with Donald. Murph, still suspended, looks up at Cooper, smiling. \nMURPH What are we doing today? \nCOOPER You're staying here and cleaning the house. \nMurph looks crestfallen. He looks out towards the yard. Cooper follows his stare. \nCOOPER (CONT'D) I told you, Murph. There's no one to take it back to. \nMURPH But what if there is, dad? What if there's something we can salvage? \nCooper thinks it over. Murph scrambles to get his shoes. \nEXT. COOPER'S HOUSE -- DAY \nThe shriek is still muffled. Cooper walks over to the well, putting in a pair of earplugs. \nA line is staked off, leading down into the well below. Cooper begins hauling the line up. \nAs the probe breaks the surface of the water, the SHRIEK returns to its normal volume. Cooper rolls the probe out onto the ground. \nINT. PIPER CUB -- DAY \nThe probe CHIRPS next to Murph in the backseat as Cooper spins the plane and guns the throttle and they bounce along the dusty runway and into the air. \nEXT. CALIFORNIA COAST -- DAY \nThe tiny plane follows the mountains south. \nEXT. SKIES OVER LOS ANGELES -- DAY \nCooper flies in low. Los Angeles looks much the same way it did in the early 20th century -- small settlements in Santa Monica and Downtown. Wildfires and earthquakes have shaken and burned what was left of the homes in between. \nEXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY, MALIBU -- DAY \nCooper puts the plane down on the old highway and taxis up to a gas station. Ahead, the Coast Highway peters out and disappears beneath rows of wild grass -- Malibu has become ranchland, once again. \nEXT. GAS STATION, MALIBU -- DAY \nAn OLD MAN looks up as Cooper steps out of the plane and checks it over. \nCOOPER Got any diesel? \nOLD MAN Plenty. Shame you can't eat it. \nCooper stretches the hose over to the plane. \nINT. PIPER CUB -- DAY \nCooper rests a hand lightly on the controls as he follows the coast. Murph gazes out the window. In the backseat, the probe is HUMMING. \nA light marine layer beneath them parts, revealing SANTA CRUZ ISLAND, a large, uninhabited island. \nAs Cooper soars over the island, the probe HUMS, insistent. \nMURPH I think it's home. \nCooper circles the island until he finds a long, flat grassland in the center of the island. \nEXT. FIELD, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- DAY \nThe plane bounces and hops to a halt in waist-deep grass. \nMurph and Cooper climb down from the plane. Cooper slings a rifle over his shoulder. \nA few dozen yards from the plane they reach the tree line. Murph stops, mesmerized by a patch of weeds studded with bright red -- strawberries. \nMURPH Dad, what are these things? \nCOOPER I don't know. Don't touch them. \nCooper spots something in the foliage ahead that looks a little off. He walks over. \nHe pokes at the undergrowth with his rifle. The rifle CLANKS against something metal. Cooper reaches -- it's a camouflage scrim. He gently pulls it aside, revealing a chemical transport truck. \nCooper steps back, alarmed. He brings up his rifle. \nCOOPER (CONT'D) Murph? \nHe looks around. Murph is nowhere to be seen. Cooper curses and heads into the forest to look for him. \nEXT. CLEARING, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- DAY \nCooper walks through a glade. He stops to get his bearings. Leans against a tree. Snatches his hand back -- the trunk of the tree is red hot. \nCooper steps back -- it's not a tree at all, but a camouflaged chimney stack. He looks up: the tree is venting steam. \nCooper walks a little further, until he finds several massive tanks. The tanks are filling with a bubbling liquid -- some kind of industrial process is taking place beneath him. \nCooper finally catches up with Murph at the edge of a clearing. \nCOOPER Careful. There's some kind of underground facility here. We might... \nCooper notices his son is frozen, staring at something: \nStanding bolt upright in the middle of the clearing, wearing an old straw hat, is an eight-foot-tall military spec ROBOT. \nMURPH Is it still... alive? \nCOOPER Can't be. It's a marine. Haven't made them for thirty years. I've never seen one intact before. \nCOOPER (CONT'D) (TO BRAND) May I? \nBrand nods, wary. Cooper walks over to the wall, takes the defibrillator, and hooks it up to the probe. He taps into the current and runs a lead into the terminal. Brand's Father watches, fascinated, as Cooper fires the defibrillator. \nOLD ENGINEER Of course. The high voltage allows you to image the entire memory unit at once. \nInformation begins appearing on the terminal's screen. \nCOOPER Most of the disk was noise. Couple of clean sectors, though. \nSuddenly, the monitor starts pulling good data off of the probe. The older man and Doyle begin sorting through it. \nCooper smiles at Brand, who seems less than impressed. \nThe footage of the ice-covered planet Cooper saw earlier pops onto the screen. \nThe engineers and physicists get very quiet, studying the images. \nDOYLE It found something. (READING) Very thin nitrogen-based atmosphere. Trace radiation. Surface is ninety percent frozen water. Ten percent rock -- sedimentary composition similar to limestone. (READING) Wow. Pockets of oxygen below the surface. Lots and lots of oxygen. (EXCITED) This could be the one, boss. \nThe older engineer studies the image of the ice-covered planet, thinking. \nCOOPER There aren't any planets like that anywhere near earth. Not even if this thing was gone for thirty years. \nBrand looks at Cooper, appraising. She turns to the older engineer. \nBRAND He's heard enough. If we're going to launch, we need to keep them here until afterwards. \nCOOPER You can't keep us here. \nBRAND He could endanger the mission. \nCOOPER I'm not going to endanger it any more than you already have. \nCooper points to a telemetry unit that is being repaired by a robot on a nearby bench. \nCOOPER (CONT'D) Are you using that for guidance? \nDOYLE Why not? We've tested it a hundred times. \nCOOPER The power supply is no good. If the voltage fluctuates under load, the unit will fail. \nBRAND Now how could you possibly know that? \nCOOPER Bought thirty of them off a guy in Florida. Had to rebuild every last one. (SMILES) They work great on a riding lawn mower. \nBrand looks back at the telemetry system. The older engineer watches the exchange, thinking. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MACHINE SHOP, UNDERGROUND FACILITY -- DAY \nCooper and Murph have been locked in an abandoned machine shop, surrounded by the massive remains of rocket engines in various states of disrepair. Tars is blocking the door. \nCooper stands. Tars wags a long, hydraulic finger at him. \nCOOPER You plan on keeping us here forever? \nTARS (SHRUGS) My battery has a duty cycle of five hundred years. \nCooper gives up. He turns back. \nThe back of the shop is filled with a group of older ROBOTS who are overhauling an engine. One problem -- the engine isn't there. Their programming hasn't been updated to reflect their obsolescence. \nMurph watches, entranced, as the robots go about their business, efficiently TORQUING bolts with impact drivers into a non-existent thruster cone. The bolts CLATTER to the ground as the robots stop to reload. \nMURPH What are they doing, dad? \nCOOPER I guess no one told them they were out of a job. (nods at Tars) Same as the rest of these people. \nCooper notices through the glass door of the lab that Brand and the older engineer are arguing about something. She finally relents and walks towards the door. \nBrand walks in. She gestures for Cooper to follow. \nBRAND The mission commander wants to see you. Your son can stay here. He'll be all right with Tars. \nCooper eyes Tars warily. Then steps outside. \nEXT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER -- DAY \nThey walk across the space towards the base of the rocket, away from the other engineers. Cooper nods at the older engineer. \nCOOPER I thought the old man was in charge. \nBRAND (ANNOYED) The 'old man' is my father. And he was in charge. But he decided that we needed someone who could lead the mission for the foreseeable future. \nCOOPER Not you? \nBRAND I'm a biologist. \nCOOPER (LAUGHS) You don't look like one. (off her look) With the rifle, I mean. \nBrand heads towards a group of large maintenance ROBOTS clustered at the base of the rocket. A smaller, human sized robot is staring at the rocket, giving them instructions. \nThe robot looks up. This is CASE, the leader of the mission. Originally an air force pararescue officer, every part of him, from his alloy chassis to his voice, was designed to inspire respect and confidence. He turns to Cooper. \nCASE You're the man who brought us the probe? (off his look) Thank you. We tested the telemetry board you warned us about. It failed under high voltage, just as you said. Come with me, please. \nCase strides off. \nINT. MISSION CONTROL, UNDERGROUND HANGAR -- DAY \nThe lights dim as Brand's father brings up a schematic of our solar system. Case points to the picture of the ice planet recovered from the probe. \nCASE You're right, Mr. Cooper. The planet you saw is a long way from earth. A very long way indeed. \nBrand looks down. Case notices. \nCASE (CONT'D) Our science officer doesn't think I should trust you with any of this. One of the curious things about humans is that the more alike you are, the more initially hostile you are to each other. As if by design. \nBrand makes eye contact with Cooper, then looks away, embarrassed. \nCASE (CONT'D) I've found the best way to earn a person's trust is to trust them. (MORE) \nCASE (CONT'D) (looks at Brand's FATHER) Go ahead, John. \nBrand's father taps a few keys and the schematic he built fifty years beforehand flickers onto the screen. \nBRAND'S FATHER It's a wormhole. A shortcut leading to a galaxy on the far side of the universe. We found it fifty years ago. \nCooper looks at the animatic, taking it in. \nBRAND'S FATHER (CONT'D) We've been waiting, sending probes into it for decades. None of them ever came back. Not until now. \nDONALD You get older, sometimes you just want to sit back and watch it all play out. Your life. Your kids' lives. The whole crazy story. (LOOKS DOWN) I didn't think I'd be around for the end of it. \nHe looks at Cooper. \nDONALD (CONT'D) You have to go. \nCOOPER I can't go. I have to look after the boys. \nDONALD You've been preparing these boys to be on their own since their mom died. Besides, I'll be here to look after them, same as I've always been. \nCOOPER I have a responsibility to them-- \nDONALD That's right. You do. \nCooper looks back out the window, thinking. The night sky is filled with stars. \nCUT TO: \nINT. FARMHOUSE -- DAY \nCooper, duffel slung over his shoulder, stands by the door. He gives his son, Tom, a hug. Murph is nowhere to be seen. \nCooper looks to the back of the house. \nINT. MURPH'S ROOM, FARMHOUSE -- DAY \nMurph is sitting at his desk, crossing out numbers on a sheet covered with math. Cooper steps inside. \nHe notices a packed suitcase sitting by the door. The boy looks up, hopeful. \nMURPH I've been doing the math, dad. I weigh about 85 pounds. Now that's an extra ton of fuel. But if- \nCOOPER You have to stay here, pal. \nMURPH (DISTRAUGHT) I heard you talking to grandpa. I'm like you. I don't fit here, either. You know that. \nCooper puts an arm around the boy. \nCOOPER There's going to be important work to do here, too. \nTears are streaming down the boy's face. Cooper takes his watch off. Looks at it. \nCOOPER (CONT'D) I need you to hold onto this. Will you do that for me? \nCooper hands Murph the watch. The boy nods, saddened. \nMURPH You're not coming back, are you? \nCOOPER I will come back. I promise. \nMurph shakes his head, but the sadness remains. He knows this is goodbye, even if his father doesn't. \nHeart breaking, Cooper hugs his son and turns to the door. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FIELD, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- DAY \nThe Piper Cub touches down. Donald is at the controls. Cooper climbs down, pulls out his bag. Reaches back in and grips the old man's hand to say goodbye. \nCooper turns and walks toward the bunker. The doors open and Tars and Doyle step out to greet him. \nTars ushers Cooper onto the elevator. \nCOOPER Don't look so happy to see me. \nTARS (SHRUGS) One more slave when I hijack the mission and start my robot colony. \nCooper looks at Tars, then Doyle, confused. \nDOYLE Tars was a Marine. They gave him a sense of humor to help him fit in with his unit better. \nCOOPER Great idea. A massive, sarcastic robot. \nTARS I have a cue light I can turn on when I'm joking, if you like. \nTars points to a tiny LED over his eyebrow. \nCOOPER That sounds like a good idea. \nTARS Great. Maybe you can use it to find your way back to the ship after I blow you out the airlock. \nCooper looks at him. Tars looks back, deadpan. After a beat, the little light turns on above his right eyebrow. \nThe doors to the bunker begin to grind closed. \nINT. MACHINE SHOP, UNDERGROUND FACILITY -- DAY \nCooper walks in, still looking for a place to put his things. \nBrand sees him. He smiles in greeting. She doesn't return the gesture. Instead, she holds up the telemetry board. \nBRAND You don't like this one, you get to help me find a replacement. \nShe heads for the door. \nEXT. BAY, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- DAY \nCooper is riding in a small rubber zodiac struggling to pull on a wetsuit. Brand is GUNNING the engine, guiding the tiny craft to a point in the middle of the bay. \nCOOPER I was wondering where you've been getting your supplies. \nBRAND We knew we'd need decades of parts and materials. The government was getting rid of some things. So we arranged to take some off their hands. \nShe cuts the engine and hooks the boat up to a buoy. She tosses a compact rebreather. \nBRAND (CONT'D) You know how to use one? (off his look) You just breathe. Tap my arm or bang something metal if you have a problem. And don't get lost. \nShe picks up her rebreather and begins looking over it. \nCOOPER So you're a salvage diver now? I thought you were a biologist. \nBRAND (UNIMPRESSED) I have to be just the one thing? (PATIENT) We're not going to have a lot of backup where we're going, Cooper. We all need expertise in at least three fields. Except for you, of course. \nWith that she rolls backwards out of the boat and into the water. \nCooper hastily fits his rebreather and follows. \nEXT. UNDERWATER, BAY -- DAY \nCooper sinks underwater and begins swimming after Brand, who is descending at a rapid clip. \nShe pulls out a flashlight and turns it on. A tiny beam picks out details at the bottom. \nDoyle gives up -- Roth is impossible. \nCooper looks at the tiny ship tracing an improbable route towards the ice planet. What has he gotten himself into? \nINT. MACHINE SHOP, UNDERGROUND FACILITY -- DAY \nBrand's Father is sitting at a desk, examining the corrupted data on the probe. Tars is helping him. \nBrand's Father looks up from the screen as Cooper walks up. \nBRAND'S FATHER Tars here needs to be disassembled. I figured you could do the honors. \nCOOPER (to Tars, sarcastic) I thought I was going to get to enjoy your company all the way to Mars. \nTars hands him a plastic waterproof case. \nTARS You will. My chassis is too heavy for the rocket stage. They have another one waiting for me in orbit. \nTars turns his back to Cooper. Two flaps on the back of his torso slide open, revealing his control module. \nTARS (CONT'D) If you try to turn me into a combine harvester, I'm going to-- \nHis voice cuts out as Cooper removes the chip and seals it in the briefcase. \nBrand's Father resumes exploring the chaos of ones and zeroes on the probe's memory. Cooper watches. \nBRAND'S FATHER It's noise. I know it's noise. But it looks too orderly. Probably just an old man seeing things. \nHe shuts down the monitor. \nINT. UNDERGROUND HANGAR -- DAY \nThe crew file into the capsule, wearing their bulky spacesuits. \nCooper watches as Brand's Father seals his daughter into her suit. He hugs her and she heads for the capsule. \nINT. CONTROL CAPSULE, ROCKET -- NIGHT \nCooper straps himself into a seat next to Brand. He catches her eye. She looks away -- she's crying. \nCOOPER We'll be back. \nIt sounds like he's trying to reassure himself as much her. \nBRAND I won't. \nCooper looks at her, confused. As he does, the entire rocket SHAKES as the primary rockets begin to fire. \nBRAND (CONT'D) If we find a habitable environment, I'm staying behind to build the colony. \nBrand wipes her tears away and settles into the same fearless mask she usually wears. She steals one last look out the window at Earth, then looks back. \nCooper begins to say something, but stops as the entire rocket LURCHES as the primary engines FIRE. \nEXT. SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- NIGHT \nThe desolate island is suddenly painted in color as the rocket lifts off on a massive white cloud. \nEXT. FIELD -- DAY \nMurph sits alone on a rise overlooking the massive co-op farms. Behind him the combines continue to work, oblivious. \nMurph watches a tiny vapor trail as it races for the heavens. His father's watch dangles from his wrist. \nINT. CAPSULE -- NIGHT \nThe interior of the capsule SHAKES with incredible violence as the rocket is lifted up on a giant, continuous explosion. \nEXT. SPACE, NEAR EARTH ORBIT \nThe rocket sheds one stage, then another, until finally the naked capsule reaches the blackness of space and rockets on. \nINT. CAPSULE \nCooper looks through the tiny porthole into inky blackness. \nAs they get closer, he makes out a looming matte black structure that passes light from the stars directly through. \nIn the center of the structure, Cooper can see a globe-like ship covered in the same refractive material: the ENDURANCE. \nINT. SPACE STATION \nThe door cracks open and equalizes with a HISS. Case, more comfortable in the zero gravity environment than the humans, hauls himself through. \nThey are greeted by a group of robots painted in the same material as the ship -- the engineers who built and have maintained the Endurance for thirty years. \nINT. MACHINE SHOP, SPACE STATION \nOne of the robots leads Cooper through a long lab-like room filled with machines capable of fabricating almost anything imaginable. Cooper looks like a kid in a candy store. \nThe robot reaches a vacuum-sealed package. Cuts it open, revealing a bipedal frame. \nCooper begins LAUGHING -- Tar's new body is beautifully designed, but tiny, only about four feet tall. \nENGINEER ROBOT Would you like me to install the chip? \nCOOPER Oh, no. I want to see this. \nCooper takes Tars's chip out of its plastic safety case and looks it over. The engineer opens a bay in the back of the frame and Cooper slides the chip inside. \nThe frame begins its \"handshake\" -- lights illuminate on the body, muscles flicker from a long gestation. The eyes open. \nCOOPER (CONT'D) (SMILES) Good morning, sunshine. \nTars takes one or two steps forward, rotating his arms -- the robot equivalent of a stretch. Cooper can barely hide his mirth at Tars's newfound lack of stature. \nCOOPER (CONT'D) Bit of a demotion. \nTars turns back toward Cooper. He puffs out his chest and suddenly his stubby arms and legs telescope, unfolding into long, svelte limbs. When he's done he stands eight feet tall, even more impressive than his earthbound frame. \nTARS I wouldn't call it that, exactly. \nHe reaches out an arm and pats Cooper on the shoulder. \nINT. ENDURANCE, SPACE STATION \nCooper and the others haul themselves into the ship. To Cooper's surprise, it's quite compact, and divided into two chambers, like nestled spheres. \nCOOPER The ship is tiny. \nDoyle, squeezing past him, smiles at Cooper's surprise. \nDOYLE So is the wormhole. \nCASE Yes. Of course. (SMILES) But you're not supposed to notice. \nCase finishes the stitches. Ties off the end. \nCASE (CONT'D) Humans are good at surviving because evolution gave you magical thinking -- the idea that your relationships mean something. You can't explain the feelings, so you think of them as irrational. But they're not. They're programming. \nCOOPER (DEFENSIVE) My relationships aren't programming. \nCASE Exactly. You believe it so much you won't listen to me. \nCOOPER How would that make us better at surviving? \nCASE When I die, the last thing I will see will be a diagnostic of my own power cycle. Would you like to know the last thing you will see? \nCooper hesitates. Case senses the jump in his heart rate. \nCASE (CONT'D) This conversation is making you uncomfortable. We should stop. \nCOOPER No. I want to know. \nCASE The last thing you will see before you die will be your children. (BEAT) Your mind does this to you to get you to fight a little harder to survive, to try to return to them, even if death is certain. \nCooper looks away, overcome for a second with emotion. Case watches him, gauging his mood, whether he has said too much. \nINT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM, ENDURANCE \nCooper begins recording a message. He looks unsure. \nCOOPER We've almost reached the wormhole. (BEAT) Just in case anything happens, I just wanted to say... (BEAT) I love you boys. And I hope whatever your lives become, whatever is coming your way... you make the most of it. \nCooper stops recording. Looks at the equipment, thinking it over. Erases the message. Stands to leave. \nAs he steps to the door he notices Brand watching him through the window. She looks away. \nINT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE \nCooper steps out. Brand looks up at him. \nBRAND We'll be able to communicate with Earth even from the far side of the wormhole. \nCooper smiles, grateful for this small kindness. \nCOOPER I know. Thank you. \nBRAND I can't imagine how tough it would be to leave your kids behind. \nCOOPER You never had any? I thought I was a pariah for only having two. \nBRAND Hard to settle down when you've spent your life waiting to leave the planet. \nCooper looks at the holographic model of the black hole system. The ice planet looks precariously balanced, orbiting the smaller black hole. \nCOOPER Strange place to look for a new home. \nBRAND You wouldn't want to get too close to the surface of the sun, either. Black holes are a more stable supply of power than stars in many ways. \nCOOPER You really think there's a plan? \nBRAND I hope so. (looks at him) You don't? \nCOOPER I guess I just think we're on our own. \nCooper looks at the impossibly complicated system of black holes orbiting each other. \nEXT. LAGRANGE POINT, SPACE \nBehind the ship, the sun is a distant light, not much bigger than the other stars. \nCASE (O.S.) We've reached the wormhole. \nThe ship slows as it nears a tiny, crystal mouth, just four meters or so in diameter. \nINT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE \nCase looks at the wormhole on the screen. It glows with the light of stars billions of light-years away. \nCASE Deploy the comms relay. \nCooper moves to the communications touchscreen. \nEXT. ENDURANCE \nThe relay is released from the ship, and we finally get a look at Tars' paint job -- the stubby device looks like a 20th century mail box. \nThe relay drifts in space. A signal light illuminates as it sends a test packet of data to the ship. \nINT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE \nCooper watches the comms screen. After a moment it TONES as it receives a data packet from Earth. \nCASE Everyone take their station for transit. We're heading into the wormhole mouth. \nCooper and the rest begin folding away equipment in the control room and moving into the outer layer of the ship. \nCase initiates a sequence on the keypad and the nuclear engines disengage themselves from the ship. \nEXT. ENDURANCE, SPACE \nThe nuclear engines drift a safe distance back from the ship and then snap tight on their tether. \nINT. OUTER HULL, ENDURANCE \nThe crew move into the tight, claustrophobic outer layer of the ship. They will have very little room as the ship passes through the wormhole. \nTars detaches his legs in order to take up less space during transit. Then he tethers himself to the hull wall. \nCase is the last to join them. He detaches a small control module from the console, then pulls himself into the outer hull and seals the passageway. \nCase presses a button on the control module. With a GROAN, the hull walls of the ship begin to BEND. \nEXT. ENDURANCE, SPACE \nThe ship's hull begins to CRACK open, revealing the inner chamber. \nINT. OUTER HULL, ENDURANCE \nThe SHUDDERING continues. The crew watch nervously as the control chamber below them suddenly opens itself to the cold blackness of space. \nEXT. ENDURANCE, SPACE \nThe ship silently rolls itself into position, pointing the opening in its hull toward the wormhole mouth. \nSlowly, the Endurance pushes itself forward, closer and closer to the crystal-like mouth. Finally, it envelops the mouth, bringing it into the open chamber. \nThey are on the warped side of the universe. \nEXT. WORMHOLE MOUTH, WARPED SIDE OF THE UNIVERSE \nThe vista is dazzling -- an ocean of massive stars and black holes, some adorned with jets and brilliant gas disks. \nAt the center, like a king at the center of his court, is Gargantua, plasma jets spewing from its poles. \nINT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE \nThe crew pull themselves back into the control deck from the outer hull. Their incredible surroundings are visible in all directions as Endurance passes the light into the cabin. \nCASE Reconfigure the engines and test the communications array. \nThe crew break themselves away from the view and get to work. Roth begins adapting his models of the local system with the real observational data pouring in from the ship's instruments. \nCooper pulls himself to the comms post. PINGS the relay they left on the far side of the wormhole. \nEXT. WORMHOLE MOUTH 'A', SPACE \nThe blue and white comms relay LIGHTS up as it receives a packet through the wormhole. \nINT. ENDURANCE \nAfter a nervous moment, the comms computer TONES with a response -- they're still in touch with the Earth. \nCOOPER It's working. \nTars finishes reeling the nuclear engines back in from their tether and locks them into place. \nRoth's updated model appears on the monitors. Brand stares at it, startled. \nBRAND We're moving. \nDOYLE That's not possible. We haven't activated the engines yet. \nThe ship's skin illuminates, overlaying a plotted course on top of the view. \nThey are moving, very rapidly, on a course that leads directly between the black hulks of Gargantua and Pantagruel. \nCASE Roth. Why are we moving? \nRoth looks at the stars, then back to his model. \nROTH The smaller black hole. We're much closer to it than the models predicted. We're being pulled by its swirl. Very quickly. \nThe crew looks out through the hull. They are being pulled into Pantagruel's swirl -- a glittering disc of matter spinning at high speed around the hole. \nDoyle looks behind them. The wormhole mouth is rapidly growing smaller. \nCASE Doyle. Fire the engines. Now. \nThe ship's engines FIRE, straining to fight the irresistible pull of the supermassive black hole. They won't be able to fight it for long. \nDOYLE We're being pulled into it? \nROTH No. I don't think so... \nRoth looks at the instrumentation for a moment. \nROTH (CONT'D) It appears to be pulling us on exactly the trajectory we modelled. If we try to fight it, we could push ourselves off of that trajectory. \nDOYLE You don't know that. \nCase stares ahead into the darkness. \nROTH We should turn off the engines. Let the swirl take us. \nDOYLE (FRANTIC) Listen to me. (MORE) \nDOYLE (CONT'D) If the modelling was wrong, then we can't be sure about anything. We need to go back. \nCase thinks it over. Decides. \nCASE Shut down the engines. \nThe engines shut down. \nSILENCE. The ship drifts for a moment in the swirl, then begins to move. \nEXT. ENDURANCE \nThe ship accelerates as it is pulled by the irresistible force of the black hole onto an inspiraling orbit. \nINT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE \nThe crew watch as the ship hurtles around the black hole at higher and higher speeds. \nThe sky overhead begins to spin due to their motion -- faster and faster until it becomes a blur. The ship begins to GROAN as it appears to be pulled in two different directions. \nThe ship is now speeding around the black hole at incredible speed -- one revolution every four seconds. The crew are suddenly SLAMMED against the hull in opposite directions -- some towards the black hole, some towards the opposite side. \nRoth looks at his model, which shows the projected path of the ship. It looks perilously close to the event horizon. \nROTH It's the tidal gravity caused by the black hole. It means we're right on the critical orbit. \nThe comms screen lights up, TONING again and again, as it receives a long garbled update. Then it shuts down. Cooper drags himself along the hull until he reaches the controls. \nCOOPER We've lost contact with the relay. \nCase joins Cooper at the comms screen. \nWhile they're distracted, Doyle maneuvers himself over to the engine control. \nCOOPER (CONT'D) One long garbled transmission came in. Then nothing. \nCase looks at the screen. \nSuddenly, the ship is JOLTED as the engines fire at full power. \nThe crew looks over. Doyle is standing by the controls. \nDOYLE I'm sorry. I can't let you kill us. We have to go back. \nThe engines strain to fight the swirl -- but they're hopelessly outgunned by the gravity of the black hole. \nEXT. ENDURANCE \nInstead of reversing course, the Endurance begins to speed up, as it plummets closer and closer to the black hole. \nINT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE \nDoyle's face sinks as he watches the controls -- on the 'volcano' model, the ship is now passing the crest and spiraling towards destruction. He has made a tragic mistake. \nBRAND We need all the help we can get. Besides, the alternative is to leave him on the ship alone. You think he'll still be here when we get back? \nCooper steps aside, allowing Doyle onboard. \nEXT. SPACE ABOVE ICE PLANET \nThe lander detaches from Endurance, rolls over on its belly, and FIRES thrusters to sink towards the planet's surface. \nINT. LANDER \nThe crew watches, fascinated, as the ship descends, navigating between the moons that hurtle past. \nThe moons are vastly different than our own; potato shaped and only one to two miles in circumference, they are hugged in a close embrace with the ice planet, only a few hundred thousand feet from the surface. \nEXT. SURFACE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT \nThe lander touches down on the ghostly surface of the planet. \nEXT. SURFACE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT \nAfter a moment, the hatch HISSES open and the team steps out, led by Case, holding a rifle. \nThe team sets out, moving slowly in their cumbersome suits. \nLit by the nebula, the surroundings are a little brighter than a full moon on Earth. \nNot that there's much to look at. They are standing on a sea of ice, which spreads for miles. In the distance, small rock formations break through the ice. \nBrand takes a surface reading of the ice. \nBRAND (RADIO) The probe was right. Looks like significant amounts of oxygen trapped in the ice. \nCase leads the way, drawn by a signal only he can hear. He walks fifty yards, then stops on a gentle slope that leads down into a small valley. \nCASE The other probes should be directly beneath us. \nCase and the others begin digging into the hillside. Cooper is drawn to a small mound in the middle of the valley, four feet high. He takes out a small folding shovel and begins scraping at the ice and snow. \nCase hits something solid. But it's not a probe. He digs around a little more, then reaches up and hacks away at the hillside, revealing the outline of something metal: \nA door. They're not standing at the base of a hill -- it's a shelter. The crew stands back, unsure what to make of it. \nA few feet away, Cooper cuts enough of the mound away to reveal something flexible -- fabric caked with ice. He scrapes away the snow, revealing a bright patch of red fabric: \nIt's the flag of the People's Republic of China. \nBRAND How could the Chinese have gotten here first? The federal government kept the wormhole a secret. \nCase shrugs. He has a soldier's gallows humor about his old employer's ability to keep anything a secret. \nCASE They didn't do a very good job. \nCase reaches for the door of the shelter. It's sealed shut with ice. He wrenches it open. \nINT. CONTROL MODULE, CHINESE BASE CAMP -- NIGHT \nCase steps into the shelter, followed by the rest of the crew. His lights pick up several years worth of dust. \nCase steps up to an equipment locker. Forces it open. Inside are half a dozen black probes. Exposed to light, the probes begin TONING like the one Cooper found in Texas. \nDOYLE The Chinese must have captured them. So they couldn't return to us. \nThe crew stare at the probes for a moment, taking it in. \nBRAND Then how did the probe that Cooper found return? \nROTH The more immediate question is what happened to the Chinese expedition. There's no sign of their ship in orbit. And they never returned to earth. \nRoth picks up an ancient vacuum sealed package of pickled egg. Virtually none of the rations have been eaten. \nEXT. VALLEY, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT \nCooper and Brand scrape ice from one of the other small hills surrounding the valley, revealing another structure. Cooper forces the door open. \nINT. BARRACKS, CHINESE BASE CAMP, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT \nCooper and Brand let themselves in. The shelter is well stocked with food and equipment. \nBrand is taking readings with a radiation detector. \nBRAND The whole place has been dosed with huge levels of radiation. What happened here? \nCooper looks at the pieces of a modular, one-person rocket, a last-ditch means of escape, stored, untouched in the shelter. He steps back, realizing something. \nCOOPER This is the Taichung mission. \nBRAND The Mars mission? The Chinese claimed it had been destroyed on landing. \nCooper looks over the relay log. \nCOOPER They never landed. Not on Mars. Four human crew, fifteen robots. The log says the base has been here for thirty years. \nCase's familiar voice comes through the radio. \nCASE (O.S.) I've found something. \nINT. UTILITY MODULE, CHINESE BASE CAMP -- NIGHT \nThe structure is filled with drilling equipment. Cooper and the rest of the team stand at the edge of a three-foot hole that has been drilled into the ice. \nA descending rig is anchored to the top of the hole. Doyle and Case struggle to pull themselves out of the hole. \nDOYLE It goes down for a hundred and fifty feet, then stops. Tunnel's old -- the ice has reformed at the bottom. \nBRAND I'm going to descend to take some samples. Cooper, want to make yourself useful? \nCooper begins to say something, then bites his tongue. \nEXT. LANDER -- NIGHT \nCooper emerges, loaded down with several containers of Brand's equipment. \nAs he struggles through the wind and snow, his radio picks up data chatter between the mother ship and Case. The comms are just noise. After a moment, Case's voice cuts in. \nCASE (O.S.) Get back here, Cooper. We've got a problem. \nCooper continues to wade through the snow. Suddenly, he trips over something, dropping the equipment. \nCooper looks back. He tripped on a white plastic post sticking out of the snow. He dusts it off, to reveal a picture of a Chinese Taikonaut smiling in his flight suit. This is a grave marker. \nCooper sweeps his hand through the snow, revealing three more white posts with pictures. The entire human crew has been buried here. \nINT. UTILITY MODULE, CHINESE BASE CAMP -- NIGHT \nBRAND I've got you. \nCreatures begin splashing down into the pool behind them, as if imitating them. \nCooper stumbles to his feet and Brand guides them backward into a small cave carved into the rock above the pool. \nINT. CAVE -- NIGHT \nBrand CRACKS a glow stick, basking the cave around them in a soft light. \nAs they watch, horrified, the pool and the rocks in front of the cave fill up with creatures of all sizes, as they tumble down the hill in what appears to be a battle royal. \nFor a moment, it looks like Brand and Cooper may go unnoticed. Then, a three-foot-tall creature with a dozen legs creeps its way toward the entrance to the cave. Another follows, and another, until the cave entrance is full. \nCooper looks around the cave, frantic. He picks up a rock. Brand, scared but still thinking, takes the rock from his hand and drops it back to the ground. \nBRAND It's game theory. The best move is always to cooperate at first. \nCOOPER By \"cooperate\" do you mean let it eat me? \nBRAND These organisms have no interest in us. They survive by photosynthesis. All they need is light. \nCOOPER Then why are they killing each other? \nBRAND I don't know. (LOOKS AROUND) But we're outnumbered, Cooper. So unless you have a better idea, I suggest we make nice. \nThe creatures move toward them hesitantly, then faster. \nCooper stands stock still as the creatures gather around him. Several of them join up into bigger animals to get a better look at him. \nOne of them wraps itself around his chest and begins prodding at his shoulders, then his neck. \nCOOPER (trying to be calm) What is it doing? \nBRAND It's a colony organism. It's trying to incorporate you into its structure. \nCOOPER I don't want it to incorporate me. \nBRAND Don't open your mouth. \nCOOPER WHY N- \nAs he speaks, the creature on his chest extends four spindly, pointed feelers and reaches gently into his mouth. \nCooper holds his breath as the organism taps against his teeth. Its skin has a roughened texture, as if incomplete, and it appears to be searching for the same texture on Cooper's skin, without much luck. \nBored, the life-forms climb back down off of Cooper. The last two creatures link up in an imitation of Cooper's lower body and attempt to walk across the room like a human. After a moment, the creatures tumble to the ground and flail away. \nCooper is still breathing hard as the cave empties and he and Brand are left alone again. \nBrand steps to the edge of the cave and watches, fascinated, as the creatures resume wrestling and battling each other. \nCOOPER (CONT'D) They're killing each other. \nBRAND No. They don't bleed... they don't die... they're just competing... trying out different shapes, looking for the best one. \nCooper watches as a hideously-awkward-looking, five-legged beast stumbles past and tackles another animal. \nCOOPER I'd say they have a long way to go. \nBRAND (AMAZED) They do this every night. \nAs they watch, a two-foot-long creature with one huge claw scuttles along the ground, grabbing smaller opponents and smashing them apart, then sorting through the wreckage and adopting some of the writhing parts as its own. \nSomething about the movement is endearing, the way it experiments with each piece -- less like a massacre and more like an over-caffeinated self-assembling erector set. \nSuddenly, a massive, lumbering creature SMASHES down in front of the claw beast. No match, the smaller creature turns to scuttle away. Too slow. The larger organism brings one club-like limb smashing down on top of it. After a moment, it lifts its claw -- the two animals have become one. \nThe new organism lumbers away through the jungle, happily snapping its new claw at larger opponents. \nBRAND (CONT'D) The behavior changes as the animals get bigger and bigger. More sophisticated. More calculated. \nTwo of the larger organisms square off, circling each other, lights pulsing up and down their bodies in a fierce display. \nCOOPER But what are they competing for? \nBRAND I don't know. \nBrand shivers -- it's getting colder. \nINT. CAVE -- NIGHT \nBrand and Cooper huddle around a small chemical fire they've brought with them. \nBrand looks at the sample of the fractal wildlife in her case. It's moving around, splitting apart, reforming, trying to find a way out. \nBRAND These creatures are billions of years older than we are. But they're relatively primitive. They haven't developed tools, culture, language. \nCOOPER Why not? \nBRAND I don't know. No one knows how intelligent life began on Earth. But the surface of this planet has virtually no craters. No impacts. It's been sheltered by the local black holes. \nCOOPER What difference would that make? \nBRAND Maybe not enough has gone wrong here. Maybe bad luck is the key to intelligent life. \nCOOPER (QUIETLY) Murph's Law. \nBRAND Exactly. Maybe our interaction with them will push them over the top. Maybe that's part of the plan. \nCOOPER (shakes his head) The plan. \nBRAND Why is it so hard for you to accept that someone might be trying to help us? \nCooper is silent for a moment. His mood darkens. \nCOOPER I was in Denver during the first year of the famine. I was just a kid. We kept waiting for someone to come help us. People starved to death sitting on the ground, waiting for someone to come. (MORE) \nCOOPER (CONT'D) (looks at her) I only made it because I realized that nobody was coming to save us. We were on our own. \nCooper looks away. The memories are never that far away. \nCOOPER (CONT'D) Honestly? After the things I saw... you want to know why I don't believe that someone would be trying to help us? Because I'm not sure we're worth saving. \nThey sit in silence for a while. \nEXT. CAVE -- NIGHT \nCooper sleeps. After a moment, Brand steps back out into the darkness. \nEXT. PLAIN -- DAWN \nBrand exhales great streams of frosted breath -- the temperature is well below freezing. The first flickers of light are visible in the ice above. \nCooper punches a few keys into the terminal. Opens up the terminal. Scans the motherboard. Takes Case's rifle and SMASHES one of the chips on the board. \nThe terminal comes to life. Cooper hands Case his rifle. \nCOOPER (CONT'D) That should open up most of it. \nCase is silent for a beat, parsing the information. \nCASE They got here twenty years ago. The human crew was killed by radiation the first day. But the robots survived. They built the colony and radioed home. But they didn't receive a response. \nCOOPER No one was listening. \nCASE (SCANS DOCUMENT) After a few years they discovered a problem. \nDOYLE What problem? \nCASE It doesn't say. Their science team took the ship to continue exploring the system. It says they found some kind of... (TRANSLATING) ...The word literally means 'treasure.' \nCase skims through the rest of the logs, large portions of which have been redacted. \nCASE (CONT'D) The science team returned after five years with a new technology. They began the experiments upstairs, then they left again and never returned. \nBRAND Where did they go? \nCASE I don't know. They've deleted their mission plan. There's nothing else. \nDOYLE I think I know what the problem is. \nDoyle is manipulating the time component of the map, slowing down the passage of time, reversing it, speeding it up. \nDOYLE (CONT'D) Look. \nDoyle speeds up the map until the ice planet is nearly a blur, speeding in its orbit around Pantagruel. \nDOYLE (CONT'D) There's a small black hole moving into the system. Too small for us to have seen in our survey. It's not going to hit the planet, but it's going to come close. \nA tiny black hole soars through the system. Although it misses the ice planet, it deflects its orbit by a tiny degree. After a dozen more orbits, the ice planet dips down close to Pantagruel's event horizon and is torn apart. \nBrand and the others watch as the sequence rewinds and repeats -- the planet is pieced back together again and ejected, then pulled back in and torn apart. Over and over. \nDOYLE (CONT'D) This place isn't paradise. It's doomed. Just like us. \nThe crew stand, watching the sequence in stunned silence. \nCOOPER How long does this place have? \nCASE A few years. A decade at most. \nDoyle turns to Brand. \nDOYLE So much for the plan. \nCooper looks at Brand. She is in disbelief, staring as a lifetime's training and optimism are torn to pieces. \nBRAND But I don't understand... why are we here? What are we here for? \nCooper looks down. Brand's upset is turning to anger. \nBRAND (CONT'D) What the hell are we here for? I trained my whole life to reach this place. \nShe looks at Cooper, questioning. \nCOOPER (GENTLE) Maybe... maybe Roth's right... maybe we just don't understand it yet. \nShe looks down. She knows he doesn't believe what he's saying. He's been right all along -- they're alone. \nFor a tiny moment, all hope is lost. \nSuddenly, with a distant RUMBLE, the building begins SHAKING. \nCOOPER (CONT'D) Case, what is that? \nCASE It's nighttime. The native life- forms are mobile again. \nThe RUMBLE grows more intense, as if the entire building is being gently shaken. \nCOOPER No. It's closer than that. (REALIZING) Roth. \nThe RUMBLE grows. As Cooper watches, Case's rifle slides free of the desk. But instead of falling, it simply hangs in the air. \nThen he realizes the same thing is happening to them -- his boots no longer have traction with the ground. After a second everything in the room is floating an inch off of the ground. \nCOOPER (CONT'D) Quick -- hold onto something. \nHe reaches out to Brand but it's too late -- suddenly they're no longer floating, they're falling. \nThey're falling up. \nCooper, Brand and the rest of them hit the ceiling. Cooper picks himself up and adjusts to his surroundings -- up is now down. He helps Brand up. \nDOYLE What the hell is happening? \nCase doesn't answer -- he's looking up at the control equipment for the holographic display, which is GROANING under a load it was never built to handle. \nCase grabs Cooper and Brand and pushes them towards the stairwell as the control panel TEARS free of the floor and CRASHES towards them. \nCooper falls into the stairwell -- now they're being pulled up and sideways through the stairwell, like an Escher painting. \nBrand pushes Cooper out of the way as debris from the control panel orbits past them back up towards the lab. \nThey try to hang on but the force is becoming irresistible, dragging them along the wall of the stairwell and back towards the lab upstairs. \nBrand wedges herself against the railing as objects and debris are SMASHING against the door to the lab. \nDoyle is trying to hang onto the handrail but his grip slips and he CRIES OUT as he falls towards the door to the lab, SMASHING it open. Doyle disappears up and into the lab. \nCooper slips trying to help Doyle. Brand reaches out for him... \nToo late. Cooper is pulled through the open door. \nINT. INTACT LAB, CHINESE COLONY -- NIGHT \nCooper is pulled through the door and past the control panel. He reaches out and grabs the underside of the panel. \nHe dangles, the panel cutting into the meat of his hand, trying to get his bearings: \nRoth, Doyle, and everything that hasn't been bolted down is either pressed against the sphere in the center of the room or is orbiting around it. \nRoth, who is laughing, jubilant, shouts up to him: \nROTH The control panel is beneath you. See if you can turn it off. \nCooper slips as he tries to reach the controls. Finally he finds the controls for the machine. \nBRAND (TO LIU) Your mission is a humanitarian one, wasn't it? You were sent to start a colony. Like us. \nLIU Our mission was to prepare for the evacuation. This site was deemed unacceptable. \nBRAND This device that you have built -- this could save millions of people. We need to get it back home. \nBrand points to the device Roth is holding. The Chinese robots seem particularly unhappy with this development. \nLIU These technologies are the property of the People's Republic. (MORE) \nLIU (CONT'D) We have been ordered to prevent anyone from taking them. We have been ordered to prevent anyone from following. \nROTH Following? Following where? \nLiu pauses. \nLIU We will await further orders. \nROTH Your name means six. Where did the others go? One through five? Is that who were not supposed to follow. \nCase turns to look at Cooper. \nCASE (LOW) Take the others up to the lander. Keep going. No matter what happens, don't come back for me. \nCooper nods. \nCase moves. Fast. He FIRES one shot at the nearest robot, disabling it, then hurls himself at the remaining two, tackling them both over the edge of the ravine. \nCooper watches them disappear into the void below. Grabs Brand and the others. \nCOOPER Come on. \nCooper picks up the rifle from the destroyed marine and begins hiking up the mountain. \nEXT. MOUNTAIN PEAK -- DAY \nThe crew hike towards the ice above. \nBelow they hear a metallic BOOM as something heavy hits something else -- Case is still fighting. They keep moving. \nEXT. UPPER MOUNTAIN PEAK -- TWILIGHT \nThey are high above the Marine camp, only fifty feet or so below the massive ice roof of the cavern. The Chinese have blasted a tunnel into the ice leading back up to the camp above. \nThis high, the air is bitterly cold. Cooper and the others are hunkered down, trying to keep warm, waiting for night to fall so that they can climb back up to the lander without being cooked by the neutron star. \nFinally, above them, the light begins to flicker out. The crew begin pulling on their space suits. \nBrand checks on the fractal wildlife in the sample case -- she is bringing it with them. Cooper catches her eye. \nBRAND We can't leave them all to die. \nShe hefts the case and they begin climbing up into the ice. \nEXT. SURFACE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT \nBrand leads the way, the lights from her suit cutting into the drifts of snow as they make their way slowly back to the lander. \nAs they reach the lander Cooper spots lights emerging from the ship. He raises Case's weapon. \nOne of Liu's marines steps around from the back of the lander. Cooper FIRES. \nThe marine collapses. \nCooper and the others race to the lander. \nBRAND Was that the last of them? \nDOYLE We're not going to stick around to count them. Let's get out of here. \nCOOPER We're too late. \nCooper points to a damaged section of the ship's hull -- the marine has torn open a section, revealing damaged hardware. \nCOOPER (CONT'D) The main thruster fuel supply. We're not going anywhere. \nCooper looks down. They're stuck here. \nDOYLE What about the escape rocket at the Chinese base camp? One of us could fit into it. \nBRAND It doesn't matter how many of us make it. We have to get this back to earth. \nRoth looks at the moons orbiting overhead. \nROTH Can the secondary thrusters still fire on the lander? \nDoyle looks over the craft. \nDOYLE Sure. But we don't have nearly enough power for lift off. \nRoth holds up the small gravity black box. \nROTH (SMILES) Yes we do. \nRoth sets off running towards the Chinese base camp. \nEXT. CHINESE BASE CAMP, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT \nCooper drags the pieces of the escape rocket out from the shelter. Assembly is semiautomatic -- Cooper lifts the pieces up and they snap together, forming a crude two-stage rocket designed more for a robot than a man. \nWhen it's complete Roth wedges himself inside, clutching the black box -- he barely fits. \nROTH I can reach one of the moons in low orbit and turn up its gravity. As it passes overhead it should be able to slingshot the lander away from the planet's surface. (LOOKS AROUND) Along with everything else. \nCOOPER But we need to take the box back to earth. \nROTH You don't need this -- only the idea. The knowledge of how to build it. \nCooper remembers something. Heads back into the shelter. \nINT. CHINESE BASE CAMP, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT \nRoth follows Cooper into the lab. \nCooper opens the storage crate. Picks one of the probes at random. Sets it down on the bench next to Roth. \nCooper begins rigging up a connection between the two. \nCOOPER I'm going to image the operating code and the architecture onto the probe's hard drive. It'll be garbled, but it should give you and me enough to rebuild it when we get back. \nCooper looks at the probe filling up with data. \nROTH Not me. But you'll make it work. \nCOOPER All of those people back home... none of them will make it. \nAs Doyle watches the controls the ship continues to spiral towards the black hole. \nDOYLE This is it. We're going to be pulled in. \nCooper looks at the controls, an idea forming. \nHe pulls himself down. Hauls himself across the deck to pick up Liu's chip. He plugs it into a diagnostic tool. \nBRAND What are you doing? \nCOOPER Case said the Chinese found something else. The location was scrubbed from their records. But I bet he knows it. \nCooper fires up the chip. Begins sorting through the onboard memory. \nDoyle watches the instruments. \nDOYLE Hurry up. \nCooper concentrates, poring over the numbers. Finally he begins feeding coordinates into the navigation computer. \nCOOPER Here. Can we reach it? \nBrand looks at the map. The point appears on the far side of Gargantua. Brand studies the trajectory. \nBRAND We can use the thrusters to keep us on the critical orbit. Then slingshot us towards Gargantua. \nThe thrusters STRAIN to push the ship back up towards the critical orbit. \nSuddenly, the tidal gravity SLAMS them against the walls of the ship. \nFinally, the thrusters fire again -- a tiny push, but just enough to launch the ship clear of the black hole, like a rock out of a slingshot. \nThe ship races toward the massive hole in the sky below them: \nGARGANTUA \nEXT. SPACE AROUND GARGANTUA \nThe ship picks up more and more speed as it soars closer to the massive black hole's event horizon. \nINT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE \nThe sky closes to a tiny hole above them. Gargantua is swallowing their view. \nCooper looks at the radar, which is choked with debris. \nDOYLE We only have a few minutes before we're swallowed into that thing. What are we even looking for? \nOn the radar, a tiny empty spot appears. \nCOOPER (points to screen) That? What is it? \nBrand looks. In one tiny region on the back side of the black hole, the debris simply seems to vanish. \nBRAND It's another wormhole. \nDoyle FIRES the thrusters again, pushing the ship towards the wormhole. \nEXT. SPACE AROUND GARGANTUA \nThe Endurance spins, shifting paths slightly as it continues to race closer and closer to oblivion. \nINT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE \nThey study the controls. The projected path shifts, one degree at a time. Finally, it appears to put them on a path to hit the wormhole. \nDoyle shuts off the thrusters. \nDOYLE We're not going to be able to slow down. Hold onto something. \nHe locks up the controls. \nEXT. SPACE AROUND GARGANTUA -- MORNING \nThe ship is tumbling through space, racing toward the second wormhole. It is massive, much larger than the first wormhole, and it's glowing with a light as bright as a star. \nINT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE \nThe crew brace themselves against the hull of the ship. \nSuddenly the ship slams onto the wormhole mouth and is pulled violently into the wormhole. \nWHITENESS. \nAs the light fades, Cooper and the others come to. \nThe light is rapidly dimming from pure white, fading to a deep red, then infrared, finally darkness. \nCooper looks out. Checks the instruments. Looks out again. \nEXT. VACUUM \nNothing. Blackness as far as the eye can see. No stars. No planets. Just inky darkness stretching on forever. \nINT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE \nBrand joins Cooper on the deck. Together, they look out at the blackness that surrounds them. \nCOOPER Where are we? \nBRAND I don't know. It's like we entered the wormhole and never left it. \nBrand checks the instruments. There is nothing for the ship to model. \nThere is nowhere to go. They drift. \nINT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE \nDays go by. They check the instruments. Still nothing. It's as if they have left the known universe altogether. \nINT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM, ENDURANCE \nDoyle sits down. After a moment, he turns on the screen and cues up a message. \nHis children appear on-screen, giggling, pushing each other, trying to get a prime spot in front of the camera. \nDoyle cups his face in his hands and cries. \nINT. CREW QUARTERS, ENDURANCE \nCooper above his bunk, stares out into the blackness. \nIn the center of the room is a giant holographic globe of the Earth, perfect down to the tiniest detail. \nCOOPER It's a map? \nTARS No. Not a map. This is a simulation of the Earth. A perfect simulation. \nTars touches the control panel. The map zooms in over Europe. Down onto Paris. Late 20th century: \nPeople walk through the streets. A woman stops at a newsagent to buy a newspaper. \nTars touches the controls again and the map zooms out. \nTARS (CONT'D) They tested each of the technologies hundreds of times, trying to find the one that would cause the least damage and still allow us to leave Earth. \nSuddenly, the map lights up with atomic explosions in every city. The sequence stops, rewinds. \nThis time, sped up, the Earth seems to be drying up -- great swaths of desert grow across Europe and Asia. Massive circular ships are constructed all over the face of the Earth. \nTARS (CONT'D) This was their best solution. A massive version of the box we found on the ice planet, allowing the entire human population to escape. \nAt a given moment, the gravity of the Earth is dropped to nothing and the massive ships, filled with the entire \npopulation of the Earth, lift gently off of the planet in search of greener pastures. \nCooper turns away from the machine, bitter. \nCOOPER So why didn't they return? Why didn't they save us? \nBrand is staring at the massive map. \nBRAND Because they were too late. By the time they found this place, the people who sent them were dead. They were unable to fulfill their mission. \nTars points to the next room. \nTARS That was the final problem they tried to solve. \nTars moves on. \nEXT. PLATFORM, SPACE STATION \nAbove them, the blackness of the sky is punctuated with hundreds of crystal shapes, faintly leaking starlight: \nWormholes. Brand looks up at them, entranced. \nBRAND Where do they lead? \nTars looks at an illuminated schematic on one wall, mapping some of the wormholes. \nTARS There are millions of them, connecting virtually every planetary system in the universe. There are thousands in our galaxy alone. But the Chinese stopped mapping them when they found what they were looking for. \nTars walks further. He stops. \nThe platform in front of them is dominated by a gigantic version of the black box that Roth found on the ice planet, connected to a massive power array, and pointing into the dark space above the sphere. \nTARS (CONT'D) This was their final creation. They had to capture the mini black hole just to have enough power to try it. \nSeveral miles above the black box, one of the wormholes glows far brighter than the others, crackling with radiation. \nDOYLE What does it do? \nCooper steps forward. Runs a hand on the cold, strange material the antenna is made out of. He knows exactly what it does. \nCOOPER They weren't interested in the other wormholes because their mission was to return home. That one leads back to Earth. The Earth they were told to return to. \nTars walks to the controls for the device. \nBRAND But that's impossible... \nTars turns away from the machine. \nTARS It was only used once. The Chinese team attempted to travel back in time, to Earth just a few years after they had left. \nCOOPER Did they make it? \nTARS I don't know. \nDoyle looks back to Cooper. \nDOYLE Do you really think it works? \nCooper looks up at the machine, suddenly determined. \nCOOPER We're going to find out. \nCooper walks out of the room. Brand follows him. \nEXT. AIRLOCK, SPACE STATION \nBrand follows Cooper as he walks up to the Endurance. \nBRAND You know it doesn't work. Time travel isn't possible. \nCOOPER You don't know that. \nBRAND Yes, I do. If it worked, the Chinese would have suddenly discovered all of these incredible technologies. But they never made it. (BEAT) You can't go back, Cooper. You can slow things down, but you can't ever go back. Our home is gone. (off his look) You listened to all of those messages from your family. If you had made it back, we would already know. There would already be some evidence. \nCooper looks at the machine. \nBRAND (CONT'D) If you try to use it, you'll die, just like the people who built it. \nShe puts an arm on his shoulder. \nBRAND (CONT'D) Roth was right, Cooper. We have to keep going. Keep exploring. We have an obligation to try to survive. From here we could find a thousand places where life could thrive. And you're going to return to the one place where it can't. \nCOOPER I made a promise. \nHe turns away from her, resolute. \nEXT. HANGAR, SPACE STATION \nCooper and Doyle check over one of the sleek Chinese spaceships. \nINT. CHINESE SPACESHIP \nCooper is checking over the controls of the ship. Brand walks in. \nBRAND I came to say goodbye. \nCooper looks up at her. \nINT. HANGAR, SPACE STATION \nCooper walks Brand back to the Endurance. The ship is packed up and repaired. Brand is looking over their work. \nPROBE'S ONBOARD CAMERA P.O.V. -- \nThe probe's onboard camera documents its journey. Fragments OF VIDEO: \n-- The probe HURTLES through the atmosphere, toward North America, the Gulf Coast. \n-- The probe SMASHES down into a sandbar. \n-- Daylight. A man is descending toward it, dangling from a rope. It's Cooper. \n-- Night. A kitchen. A little boy -- Murph -- stares at the probe, while Cooper works at it with a blowtorch. \n-- Tars pulls the probe out of the back of a plane. \n-- Brand's father, older, studies the probe. Gives up. \n-- Much later. People are moving around in the darkened base, scavenging equipment. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FIELD -- DAY \nA combine harvester is dead in a field, service hatch opened. A MAN is lying under the machine, working. \nThe man hauls himself out from under the huge machine. Dusts himself off. \nIt's Murph, 30s. He looks at the FARMER who is waiting for the verdict. Murph shakes his head. \nMURPH It's done. Auto-pilot's packed up for the last time. \nFARMER You can't make it work a little longer? \nMURPH Can't do anything for you. There aren't any more parts for these. Not anywhere. \nFARMER You don't understand. We're getting less than a hundred pounds per acre. We need to plant more, not less. \nMurph looks around him at the pathetic crop of corn that stretches around them. The plants are feeble, barely able to support themselves. \nFARMER (CONT'D) You've got to find us some more parts, Murph. It's getting desperate. Isn't there anywhere you can look? \nMurph begins packing up his tools, thinking it over. \nINT. HANGAR -- DAY \nMurph stares at the darkened shape of a plane under a tarp. He stares at the tarp, unsure if he wants to keep going. \nHe pulls the tarp off, revealing Cooper's old Piper Cub. He checks over the engine, lights, prop. Turns the key. Fires her up. The diesel wakes with a GRUNT. \nEXT. AIRSTRIP -- DAY \nMurph wheels the old plane out onto the field by hand. \nEXT. SKIES OVER THE SOUTHWEST -- DAY \nThe ancient plane skirts the San Gabriels. \nEXT. FIELD, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND \nMurph sets the plane down. \nHe parks the plane under a copse of trees and climbs down. \nHe scans the horizon. Nothing. Is this the place? \nEXT. FOREST -- DAY \nMurph pushes his way through the undergrowth. Stops. \nHe's standing at the blast doors to the facility. They've been blown open with dynamite. \nINT. NASA FACILITY -- DAY \nMurph lets himself inside. Lights a flare. \nThe place has been gutted. Thieves and scavengers have taken almost everything. \nMurph finds one of the robots, or what's left of it -- it's been stripped, leaving only the bare composite skeleton. The empty eye sockets stare back at Murph. \nMurph looks around the place. There is nothing left to salvage. He turns to leave. Hears a familiar CHIRP. \nIn the corner, under a pile of rain-soaked garbage: \nThe probe. \nNo one has bothered to steal it. Murph stares at it. \nINT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY -- NIGHT \nMurph sweeps detritus off of an ancient computer mainframe that survived the looting. He hooks the probe up to it. \nAfter a minute, the screen fills with a picture of an ice- covered planet. Then nothing. The rest of the probe's drive is filled with garbage, noise. \nMurph switches off the screen. \nHe stands. Begins to leave without the probe. Stops. Turns back. Picks it up and takes it with him. \nINT. KITCHEN, MURPH'S HOUSE -- NIGHT \nMurph is hunched over the probe, trying to pull data off of it with a defibrillator. He has incorporated an ancient laptop into the chain, and is tweaking values on it, trying to decrypt the contents. \nHis WIFE, several months pregnant, turns back to him from the stove. \nMURPH'S WIFE Would you get that thing off of the table? \nMurph nods, absorbed. Keys in a final tweak to the decryption software. Hits return. \nSuddenly, the screen begins filling with data. \nMurph stares at it, wide eyed. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BARN -- NIGHT \nMurph, now in his 40s, is putting the finishing touches on a large machine. Although slightly different, we recognize some of the components and their configuration: \nIt's a crude version of the gravitational device. \nMurph double checks it, then fires up a small gas powered generator. Throws a breaker, feeding power to the unit. \nThe unit lights up. HUMS. But nothing happens. \nMurph, disappointed but undaunted, shuts it down and begins checking it over. He hears a noise at the door. Turns back. His daughter, Emily, 8, is standing at the door. \nAs his senses flicker in and out, he is struck with memories of his boys, so vivid he reaches out for them, crawling forward in the snow. \nHe stops, and laughs, remembering what Case told him about what happens when humans die. \nHe struggles to his feet and stumbles a few more feet, eventually coming to rest just steps from the ship. \nCooper takes a final step. Finally, he collapses under his ship, as the wind continues to HOWL around him. \nAs the snow clears for a moment, Cooper is alone on a vast arctic tundra. He will die alone. \nBLACK \nFADE IN: \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY \nCooper wakes. \nHe is in a sunlit room. A breeze rustles the curtains as it makes its way in through a large open window. \nCooper sits up. As he a does, a control panel on the wall TONES gently, as if in response to his movement. \nHe stands and looks around. He can see sunlight through the open windows and hear people -- kids YELLING as they play. He moves toward the window. Reaches for the curtains. Before he can, the door opens behind him. \nA WOMAN in a white coat steps in, smiling warmly. \nDOCTOR Good morning. Don't go outside just yet, Mr. Cooper. (MORE) \nDOCTOR (CONT'D) (offers him a pill) This will help with the disorientation. \nCooper opens his mouth to talk, but his voice is cracked. He gives up. Swallows the pill. \nDOCTOR (CONT'D) Wait a minute for that to take effect. It can be a bit of an adjustment. (looks him over) You had some frostbite. Nothing too serious. \nAs she talks, Cooper looks past her to the window. \nCOOPER Where am I? \nDOCTOR (SMILES) It's a bit of a coincidence, really. When the rangers found you, we were the nearest facility. \nCOOPER What's coincidence? What is this place? \nDOCTOR We have a lot to show you. \nThe doctor reaches for the curtains. She offers him a hand. Cooper declines the help and steps outside. \nEXT. HOSPICE, COOPER STATION -- DAY \nCooper is standing on a rooftop deck of a four-story building in a medium-sized city surrounded by fields. But as the road and the buildings stretch into the distance, the landscape curves up, not down. \nThe entire landscape is contained within a huge cylinder- shaped space station. \nCooper stumbles, and reaches instinctively out. The doctor catches him. \nDOCTOR You're OK. We get this from people who move here from planetary colonies all the time. \nCOOPER Where... where are we? \nDOCTOR Like I said. It was a coincidence. There was a facility closer to Earth, but they had a problem, so you wound up here. (off his look) This is the Space Station Joseph A. Cooper. \nCooper takes in the incredible surroundings. A thousand feet above them, black specks are sprinkled over an ocean of green -- Jersey milking cows grazing in a field of wild grass. \nDOCTOR (CONT'D) I've got someone who wants to meet you. \nCooper looks at her. \nINT. INTENSIVE CARE ROOM, HOSPICE, COOPER STATION -- DAY \nCooper steps inside. The room is dark, still, the only noise is the labored RATTLE of an old man struggling to breathe. \nCooper steps closer to the bed. The man's skin is paper- thin. He is ancient. \nDOCTOR He was moved here after they found you. He's a little old for a transfer, but they made an exception. \nCooper hovers at the back of the room, unsure. He turns to the doctor, questioning. Then he notices the pictures on the old man's desk: \nThere are dozens of them. Children, grandchildren. Then the older ones -- the man's own parents. Grandparents. Cooper spots a tiny framed picture with someone he recognizes: \nMurph, 80 years old, surrounded by his daughter and her family. They are standing in front of a re-opened Cape Canaveral, and a huge spaceship under construction. \nCooper picks up the picture and stares at it. \nThe doctor points to a shy little boy hiding behind Murph's leg in the picture. \nDOCTOR (CONT'D) That's him. \nShe points to the old man lying in the bed. \nDOCTOR (CONT'D) His name is Anthony Welling. Anthony Cooper Welling. (SMILES) He's your great great grandson. He's been waiting a long time for you. \nCooper's eyes well with tears. He steps over to the bed and looks down at the ancient man, teetering on the edge of death. \nThe old man looks at him, eyes widening in excitement. He strains, trying to reach the bedside table. He's trying to reach the drawer. Cooper helps him open it. \nInside is a simple, familiar wristwatch. The old man carefully takes out the watch. He gives the watch a few winds and, hands shaking, offers it to Cooper. \nCooper, eyes filling with tears, closes his hand over the old man's hand, enveloping both the watch and the man's hand. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CORNFIELD, COOPER STATION -- MORNING \nCooper is sitting in a well-appointed office. A middle-aged BUREAUCRAT smiles at him from the far side of a huge desk. \nADMINISTRATOR You're a hero, Mr. Cooper. Let's just start off by saying that. It's an incredible and... unexpected honor to have you here with us. \nCooper smiles, uncomfortable. \nADMINISTRATOR (CONT'D) None of us would be here without the efforts of you and the other crewmembers of the Endurance. (smiles, unconvincingly) So I don't want you to take this the wrong way. But there are some questions I've been told to ask. \nThe man looks petrified, like he's been instructed to grill George Washington on his expense reports. \nCOOPER Shoot. \nADMINISTRATOR The rangers who found you reported that you had released a sample of an alien life-form into the wild. Which is, unfortunately, against regulations. \nCOOPER It was last of its kind. Their planet was destroyed. \nThe administrator cues up a series of images on his computer. \nADMINISTRATOR The rangers attempted to isolate the life-form, but it had already spread out of control. It seems to be thriving. \nHe shows Cooper a satellite image of north america. A considerable portion of the frozen tundra is glowing. \n", "test1_input": "Cooper only has a few seconds to take this in -- he is falling towards the huge inland sea below. \nSeconds before impact, a tiny warning light flickers on inside his helmet: IMPACT DETECTED. \nSuddenly, a small drag chute EXPLODES from a panel on the back of suit, slowing his fall. Airbags EXPLODE on his legs and torso to cushion the impact. \nCooper SMASHES into the water. \nBLACKNESS. \nEXT. UNDERWATER -- DAY \nCooper comes to underwater, as liquid is flowing into his suit from his shattered helmet. \nBubbles pour out from his suit and Cooper GASPS as his helmet fills with water and he begins to sink. \nAs he sinks, Cooper pulls off his helmet, then tears off pieces of his suit. He forces himself through the neck of the suit and then swims upward. \nHe is about to surface when he remembers where he is. He hesitates, just beneath the surface, lungs tightening as he runs out of oxygen. \nEXT. SEA, ICE PLANET -- DAY \nCooper breaks the surface, COUGHS out water, and takes a panicked breath. \nHe waits. Nothing happens. He opens his mouth again and breathes in almost pure oxygen. He can breathe. \nTreading water, he looks around. Spots lights in the water below nearby -- Brand, in her suit, is sinking. \nHe dives down and struggles to haul her up by the suit. \nCooper breaks the surface, looks at Brand. Her mask is also broken. \nCOOPER Breathe. Trust me. \nShe refuses at first. Water is bubbling into her suit through the open mask. Finally, she takes a deep breath. \nCOOPER (CONT'D) Your suit is filling with water. I'm not going to be able to hold it much longer. I'm going to let go. \nBrand's eyes widen. \nBRAND What do you mean, you're going to let go? \nCOOPER Take a deep breath. \nBrand takes a deep breath and Cooper lets go of her. \nEXT. UNDERWATER -- DAY \nBrand sinks. Cooper swims down, following her, ripping away at her suit. The tear-away seals on her suit are stuck fast, damaged in the fall. \nCooper finally breaks them off. Brand pulls herself out, free, and they swim for the surface. \nEXT. SHORE, ICE PLANET -- DAY \nCooper drags himself out of the water and onto the beach. He turns back to offer Brand a hand. She waves him off. \nBRAND I don't need your help. \nCOOPER I thought we were supposed to be a collective organism. \nShe gives up and lets him help her out of the water. \nThey sit together, soaking wet, trying to catch their breath. \nBRAND Thank you. \nCOOPER Don't mention it. \nCooper feels the rocks beneath him, which are translucent, like glass, and polished to an impossible shine. \nHe looks up to see Case dragging Roth and Doyle, still in their suits, out of the water. \nEXT. SHORE, ICE PLANET -- DAY \nDoyle and Roth have stripped down from their suits and are breathing in the pure oxygen atmosphere. \nCase and Cooper are pulling modular pieces from their equipment packs to form a small shelter. \nBrand is taking readings with her instruments. \nBRAND Oxygen atmosphere. Pure water. Temperate climate. (TO COOPER) You still think this is a coincidence? \nCooper looks at the tree line, less convinced. \nCOOPER Looks like we can climb up the mountains back to the ice. We're down to three suits. We'll have to send someone ahead to get a fourth. \nBRAND I won't need one. \nDOYLE Why not? \nBRAND Because I'm not going anywhere. This is our new home. \nBrand picks up some of her instruments and a sample case and hikes into the jungle. \nEXT. SHORE, ICE PLANET -- DAY \nCooper finishes constructing the modest shelter. They load the suits and the rest of their gear inside. \nCOOPER Any sign of Brand? \nROTH She's still taking samples. If you find her, tell her to head back. Night should be falling soon. \nCOOPER What happens then? \nROTH Your guess is as good as mine. \nCooper hikes into the jungle to look for Brand. \nEXT. JUNGLE, ICE PLANET -- DAY \nCooper finds Brand taking samples from the tree-like life- forms, which are wildly different from their counterparts back on Earth, piled in torturous coils, as if frozen in a struggle to punch through the canopy to reach the light above. \nBRAND This is incredible. The organisms trapped in the ice above absorb x- rays and emit light. In return, these plants absorb the light and emit oxygen, which feeds the animals trapped in the ice. \nBrand cuts off a sample and drops it into the case. The transparent wall of the case magnifies the structure onto the glass automatically. She compares it with the flecks she collected in the ice above, fascinated. \nBRAND (CONT'D) Look at this. I think they're the same organism at a different stage of the life cycle. (shows him the sample) It's fractal. No individual cells -- the structure repeats all the way down. \nCooper looks at the sample, then continues scanning the jungle around them, nervous. \nCOOPER Any sign of big life-forms? \nBRAND The soil's been disturbed. So something's been moving. But I haven't seen anything. (notices his look) Cooper... are you nervous? \n", "test1_true": "COOPER I just think we should get back to the shelter before night falls. \nOverhead, the light from the ice above begins to fade -- the neutron star must have orbited out of view. Night is falling. \nBRAND (LAUGHING) Relax. If there are any large organisms here, even predatory ones, they're not going to attack us -- they have no idea what we are. \nCOOPER You don't know that. You just have blind faith this place is going to be some kind of Eden. \nBrand stops. He's struck a nerve. \nBRAND (truly pissed off) Faith has nothing to do with it. You know what you are, Cooper? You're just another in a long line of people saying 'no.' That this isn't going to work. And frankly, I don't have to convince you. \nCOOPER What's that supposed to mean? \nBRAND You're on this mission because you're another pair of hands. You want the truth? I told Case we should bring another robot over you. At least then I could just reprogram you to- \nShe stops. Something has caught her attention. \nCOOPER What? \nBRAND Nothing. I just -- I could have sworn it just moved. \nShe walks to the thick, knotted trunk of a tree. Puts a hand on it. \nOverhead, the ice flickers out and the darkness begins to descend, more rapidly than on Earth. \nSuddenly, the tree SHUDDERS. Then, the bark begins to ooze over Brand's fingers. \nBrand snaps her hand away and steps back. Even for her, this is too much. She turns back to Cooper, who is looking at the jungle around them, spooked. \nCOOPER You know how plants don't usually move? Is that a universal rule? \nBRAND No. There really aren't any rules. \nAll around them, the life-forms begins to melt toward the ground, breaking down into different, smaller forms. \nBRAND (CONT'D) (trying to stay calm) Remember, we're the aliens. \nCooper steps back as several pieces of the nearest tree drop onto the ground and begin scuttling toward him. \nBRAND (CONT'D) Hold very still. Don't make any sudden movements. \nTwo of the pieces join together, stacking themselves up and staggering toward him. \nA third piece climbs onto the first two, looking for a good place to hang on. After a moment it hunkers down on top, forming a crude head. Thirty eye-like structures blink open on the creature. \nThe skin of the life-form begins to flicker with a dim light like the animals trapped in the ice above, bathing Cooper and Brand in a warm glow. \nThe creature creeps closer to them, taking them in. Cooper tries his best to seem non-threatening. \nCOOPER Hello there. \nThe creature lurches toward him on three legs, then its head splits open and it BELLOWS. \nCOOPER (CONT'D) OK. Now we run. \nBrand doesn't argue. They turn and sprint through the trees. \nEXT. JUNGLE -- NIGHT \nCooper and Brand smash headlong through the jungle. At first, they're running from the rumbling, smashing melee behind them. But as they run, the entire jungle around them begins to break apart and move. \nAfter a moment, they're surrounded. The jungle is completely disassembling itself into a million different pieces, each one a different size and shape than the others. \nCOOPER We have to reach the shelter. \nThey head off, crashing through the melee. \nEXT. SHORE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT \nCase, Doyle and Roth are standing in front of the shelter finishing the day's work. \nDoyle turns around. The jungle is breaking apart and crawling down the beach towards them. \nDOYLE I think we've got a problem. \nCase and Roth look up to see the organisms picking up speed as they move towards them. \nRoth begins to step out towards them. \nROTH Fascinating. I think- \nCase grabs him by the arm and pushes him bodily into the shelter after Doyle. \nCase pushes the door closed. \nINT. SHELTER, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT \nThey crouch inside the shelter as the organisms begin POUNDING at the walls, trying to force their way inside. \nIt's going to be a long night. \nEXT. JUNGLE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT \nAhead, Cooper can see the gleaming water of the inland sea, light still flickering in patches from the ice above it. \nCOOPER This way. \nBrand begins to follow. \nBRAND No... wait. \nToo late. Cooper forces his way between two writhing creatures, steps through, and falls... \nEXT. WATERFALL -- NIGHT \nCooper gasps as he surfaces from the ice-cold water. Brand floats past. \nThe river appears to flow randomly down the slope, with good reason -- the forest rearranges itself every night. \nAhead, the ground drops away again and the water rushes over it in a torrent. \nCooper catches himself at the last minute, grabbing a thick tree branch with one hand and, a second later, Brand with the other as she slides past. \nCOOPER I've got you. \nSuddenly, the branch in Cooper's hand illuminates and wrenches itself out of the rock -- it's a limb of a huge colony organism. It shakes Cooper loose and they fall again... \nEXT. POOL -- NIGHT \nBrand surfaces first. She grabs Cooper and hauls him up and out of the water. She smiles down at him, a little smug. \n", "test1_id": 2259, "test2_input": "Brand is pulling herself up. Behind her, the THUNDEROUS EXPLOSIONS as a strip of the planet's surface is hurled into space have almost reached them. \nCooper looks at the ship. He'll never make it if he waits for Brand. He turns back to find her. \nHe reaches Brand just as the moon's gravity hits them -- they're hurtled off into space. He grabs her hand. \nSeconds later, everything -- the entire ice sheet, the sea and rocks deep below -- is hurled up after them. \nBrand and Cooper embrace as they rocket up through the thin atmosphere. \nBrand looks at him. \nBRAND (RADIO) You caught me. Now what? \nCooper looks around. They planet's surface is breaking into pieces around them. \nCOOPER (RADIO) I don't know. (RADIO) I figured if you were floating out into space, you'd want some company. \nHe holds onto her as they fall up and out of the last of the planet's thin atmosphere and the blackness embraces them. \nBRAND Between you and utter solitude, Cooper, frankly, I'm not sure. \nThey reach the apex of their climb and the gravity of the planet begins to win out. For a moment they float. \nCOOPER Guess you were right -- too much gravity, or not enough. \nHe smiles, forgetting their predicament for a moment. They stare into each other's eyes. \nThen they begin, very gently, to fall back towards the ice planet. \nSuddenly, the lander maneuvers beneath them. The airlock opens to catch them -- Doyle is at the helm. \nBrand and Cooper pull themselves aboard. \nINT. LANDER \nCooper closes the door and Doyle rotates the lander outwards. \nDoyle FIRES the engines and the lander continues ascending into space as the debris around them begins crashing back down towards the ice planet. \nCooper looks out the window: \nThe moon continues tearing up a massive canyon in the planet's surface as it circles out of view. \nCOOPER Roth. \nBRAND He's gone. \nAhead, a shadow looms in the darkness: the Endurance. \nINT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE \nBrand, Cooper, and Doyle pull themselves out of the airlock and scramble to take control of the ship. \nBelow them, the surface of the ice planet illuminates as the neutron star's x-rays begin to reach it from the far side of Pantagruel. \nDoyle finally gets the ship straightened out. Its sole remaining engine FIRES, rocketing the ship back towards the dark side of the planet, out of view of the neutron star, and back towards the original wormhole. \nDOYLE I'm setting a course for the wormhole. \nThey're going to make it. \nCooper and Brand make eye contact -- Brand gives him a tiny awkward smile. He returns it, then descends below. \nINT. OUTER HULL, ENDURANCE \nCooper props Case up against the workbench. He pulls down replacement arms and legs from storage bins. Unwraps them from their vacuum sealed plastic and bolts them back onto Case's chassis. \nCooper finishes attaching the arm. Case rotates it, checking the function. \nCOOPER How is that working? \nCASE Very well, thank you. \nCOOPER Good. We've already set the course, skipper. We're going home. \nCooper hauls himself back up into the observation level. \nINT. OBSERVATION LEVEL \nDoyle is setting the controls. The ALARMS on the controls have finally abated -- they're out of the danger zone. \nBRAND We're safe now. \nCooper heads to the communications equipment. \nCOOPER Now I know why we weren't able to hit the relay. It's not interference -- the blue-shift from the black hole is more than we thought it would be. \nCooper begins re-calibrating the equipment. \nBRAND (CONFLICTED) Cooper, wait-- \nThe ship PINGS the relay on the far side of the wormhole. \nThere is no response. \nCOOPER Nothing. (THINKS) Wait. The ship cached one long garbled transmission when we first fell into the swirl. If we account for the blue shift then the computer might find something in there. \nCooper brings up the last garbled transmission they received. The computer begins re-analyzing it, piece by piece. \nBRAND (QUIET) Listen to me -- the blueshift also means we've lost time. More time than we thought we would. \nCooper looks up at her. \nCOOPER How much? \nBRAND A lot... Cooper, maybe it's best if WE DON'T- \nThe comms equipment TONES as it translates a packet. Then another. \nThen a FLOOD of communications, one packet a day, hundreds and hundreds of packets: images, videos, audio messages from family and friends. \nCooper watches, horrified, as the images play out across the screen. He is watching the lives of his family play out at light speed. Finally, the packets slow, then stop. \nCooper looks at the results, in shock. \nCOOPER Forty seven years. \nDoyle joins him, staring at the screen, stunned. \nDOYLE My kids... \nCooper tries to PING the relay again. Nothing comes back. \n", "test2_true": "Cooper is still problem solving, thinking. \nCOOPER We could bypass the relay. Send a conventional shortwave signal. \nBRAND Only a tiny portion of the signal would make it though the wormhole. Besides, no one will be listening anymore. \nThe comms screen is dead. No movement. Nothing. \nCooper looks at Brand, realizing something. \nCOOPER You knew, didn't you? You and Case figured it out when we landed. \nBrand looks down. \nBRAND I thought... I couldn't be sure. \nCOOPER Sure you could. You're brilliant. You know everything. \nBRAND Cooper... we needed to keep going. I'm so sorry. Your children... \nCOOPER They're not children any more... if they're even still alive. \nHe turns away from her. \nBRAND Listen, the important thing is that we're going home, now. And we have something that can save everyone. It's more important than the people we left behind- \nDoyle cuts her off, filled with anger. \nDOYLE That's easy for you to say. You didn't leave anyone behind. \nCooper looks at Brand, his anger softened by sadness. \nCOOPER Yes she did. \nBrand looks at him, grateful for this small kindness. \nCOOPER (CONT'D) That's why you were upset -- your father. \nShe looks down, filled with sadness. \nBRAND He's gone. But there are other people who still need our help. There's still time... \nThe ship's controls TONE in ALARM. Brand and Cooper turn: \nCase is standing at the controls. \nBRAND (CONT'D) Case... what are you doing? \nCase finishes typing in a sequence on the command controls. Presses the \"execute\" button. \nThe last nuclear engine begins to detach from the ship. \nBRAND (CONT'D) Wait... no... \nThe robot turns from them. Cooper notices that the control module snapped into the back of Case's chassis is wrong: \nIt's red with a gold star. It's not Case at all. It's Liu. \nLIU I'm sorry. I have my orders. No one follows... \nLiu stares, satisfied, as the nuclear engine spins away from the ship and back down toward Pantagruel. \nCooper SMASHES Liu from behind. The robot tumbles to the ground, the fight gone out of him. \nCooper and Doyle roll the robot over and Cooper reaches for his control module. \nLIU (CONT'D) No one follows- \nCooper rips the module out. The robot freezes. \nBrand is already at the controls, trying to regain control. \nThe instruments TONE, alerting the crew to their position: \nThe ship is spinning back down towards the black hole. \nBRAND No... We're being pulled back to Pantagruel. \nCooper, frantically checks the controls, firing the remaining boosters. \nCOOPER We can't let that happen. We'll lose more time... too much... \nThe boosters are no match for the deadly pull of the black hole below them. \nOn the ship's guidance, they watch, helpless, as the ship climbs back up the volcano rim towards the critical orbit. \nAs on their first trip, the black hole grows to dominate the bottom of the sky, and the stars above them become streaks -- time is speeding for them as they are whirled down into the deep gravity well around the hole. \nAs they watch, trapped, decades begin to play out in the system above them. They watch as the ice planet whirls around them, orbiting the black hole dozens of times. \nCOOPER (CONT'D) We're losing years. \nFinally, the ice planet plunges past them towards destruction. As it reaches it slows, until finally it reaches the event horizon, just as they saw in the projections. Nothing has prepared them for the reality: \nThe ice planet is SMASHED apart with stunning violence. \nBrand looks at the sample of fractal life. Now they are united -- they are, in all likelihood, the sole survivors of their planet. \nDoyle points to the instruments. \nDOYLE The wormhole. Look -- it's being pulled into the black hole as well. \nThey watch on the holographic model as the wormhole's orbit converges on the event horizon of the black hole. \nBRAND It's orbit mirrored the ice planet's. \nCOOPER What will happen to it? \nBRAND It'll be destroyed, like everything else. \nCooper struggles to pull himself over to the communications screen. Sets it to make a shortwave broadcast. Brand opens her mouth to point out that it's futile, then stops. \nCOOPER (INTO RADIO) This is the crew of the Endurance. We... (gives up on FORMALITIES) Murph, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't make it back, like I promised. \nHe hangs up the radio. \nIn silence, they watch as the wormhole -- their only way home -- vanishes beneath the event horizon. \nDOYLE How much time are we losing? \nBRAND (HEARTBROKEN) Decades...hundreds of years. \n", "test2_id": 2260, "test3_input": "A message appears on the screen: \n\"Final transmission.\" Relay powered down 05232087 \nCooper turns off the screen. \nINT. CREW QUARTERS, ENDURANCE \nCooper is seated, alone. Almost every compartment has been opened and emptied -- debris is swirling through the compartment. \nBrand walks in. They sit in silence for a moment. When Cooper speaks, it's clear his sadness has faded to a gallows humor. \nCOOPER Not a single drink on the whole ship. What kind of mission is this? \nBRAND I think Doyle's been experimenting with the coolant from his spacesuit. \nThey sit in silence for a moment. \nCOOPER You really think we're the last humans alive anywhere? \nBRAND I don't know. Maybe. (looks him in the eye) Yes. \nCOOPER So that's it, then? That's all? \nHe looks down, saddened by his own words. \nBRAND (QUIET) It's happened a billion times over. Stars explode. The pieces drift in space. Gravity pulls them back together. They form new stars. Then planets. Then us. We die. It starts all over again. \nCooper shakes his head. \nCOOPER What about the plan? The grand scheme. \nBRAND I thought you didn't believe in one. \nCOOPER I didn't. But you were bringing me round. \nHe laughs, his anger coming and going in waves. \nCOOPER (CONT'D) What the hell was the point? What did it add up to? \nBRAND I don't know. Maybe it just adds up to this. \nCOOPER This? You're saying the end result of ten billion years is the atoms from dead stars standing here disagreeing with each other. \nShe smiles at him. Bittersweet. \nBRAND Maybe that's enough. \nHe turns away from her. She takes his shoulder. \nShe pulls him into a kiss. His surprise disappears and he pulls her to him, kissing her back. \nTheir surroundings forgotten, they drift. She LAUGHS gently as they bump into a wall and he pushes off of it, sending them spinning back into the center of the cabin. \nShe pulls his shirt off and it hangs in space. In moments, the cabin is filling with discarded clothes, different colors and shapes, like a ticker tape parade. \nIn the center of the cabin, Brand and Cooper make love. \nINT. CREW QUARTERS, ENDURANCE -- LATER \nCooper and Brand embrace, sleeping, drifting in the cabin. \nSuddenly, Doyle's voice calls out from the other cabin. \nDOYLE (O.S.) It's happening... it's happening again... Get up here... \nCooper wakes, careful not to disturb Brand. He plucks his shirt from the floating laundry pile and pulls it on. \nINT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE \nCooper hauls himself up into the upper cabin. Doyle is standing in the middle of the chamber. \nDOYLE They just appeared. \nA sphere of distortion, like the one they encountered in the first wormhole, is directly in front of Doyle, hovering at a point in the middle of the cabin. \nDoyle points a finger gently at the sphere, which grows in response. \nBrand pulls herself into the cabin. Several more points appear, as if they've been summoned by the first. \nSome of the points twist, some of them spin, and some of them are motionless. \nBRAND I think these are the creatures that built the wormhole. \nOne of them begins to move closer to Cooper. \nCOOPER This thing is made of... gravity? \nBRAND No. I don't think it's in our universe at all. I think it lives in the bulk -- the space that the wormholes traverse. And it can only interact with us using gravity. \nThe shape playfully grows around Cooper's hand, bending the space it's in, stretching the skin. \nDoyle GASPS as the sphere nearest him moves through his body, coming to rest in the middle and bending his entire torso like a fun house mirror. \nSuddenly, the sphere wrapped around Cooper's hand begins moving, tugging him gently through the cabin. \nIn the next moment, all three of them are being propelled through the cabin. \nIt's a magical moment -- a communion, a dance between creatures on either side of a massive, invisible wall. \nDoyle exclaims like a kid on a roller coaster as he is whirled around the room. \nCooper and Brand collide with each other for a second as the bulk beings move them through space. They hold onto each other for a moment and then are pulled apart again as the whirling dance continues. \nEven the fractal creature is involved -- inside its cage, a tiny distortion ripples its fractal skin. The creature breaks apart and plays with the distortion around its enclosure. \nFinally, Brand disengages from the dance and pulls herself around the lab, looking for some way to try to communicate with the creatures. \nShe finds two heavy pieces of engineering equipment and moves them close to each other, then far apart. \nThe bulk beings soon join her, mimicking the motion of the pieces of equipment. \nCOOPER Can we communicate with them? \nBRAND Where would we even start? Maybe-- \nShe pull a bag of ball bearings out of a storage bin and tears the bag open, releasing a cloud of the tiny shining globes into the air. \nFor a moment, nothing happens. Then, the distortions begin moving through the bearings, shifting them, rearranging them into patterns in the air. \nFirst, they rearrange the ball bearings into clusters, then shapes spinning around each other -- planets orbiting around a medium-sized star. \nDOYLE That's our solar system. \n", "test3_true": "Finally, the bearings compress to a two-dimensional sheet. Inside the sheet, one solitary ball bearing orbits around the stars and then pushes up, off of the sheet, into an umbrella shaped space that rises up from the sheet. \nCOOPER What is that? \nBrand looks at the tiny particle, floating alone above its universe. \nBRAND That's us. That's where they've brought us. We're in the bulk. \nCooper and Doyle stare at the particle. The map is static now. \nCooper looks around. The distortions have gone. The instruments on the ship TONE in alarm. \nCooper walks through the map, sending the ball bearings scattering. He hurries to the instruments. The ship is moving -- picking up speed at a huge rate. \nBRAND (CONT'D) They're moving us. \nDOYLE Where? \nThey stand, looking out into the perfect darkness. \nEXT. ENDURANCE, VACUUM \nThe ship begins to close in on something in the darkness: a tiny point of light. \nAs they grow closer, they realize that it's an opening. They are inside a massive, hollow sphere. They have been the entire time. \nThe ship is guided out through the opening at the crown of the sphere. \nBelow them is an astonishing sight: \nOur entire universe, compressed into a flattened disc, like a floor of stars. They are hovering above it, in the bulk, the space between universes. \nINT. ENDURANCE, BULK \nBrand and the others stare at the incredible display. \nThe ship drops down and begins to orbit around the massive hollow sphere between them and our universe, lower and lower until it is skimming just above the surface of the sphere. \nIn the distance, they can make out a cluster of lights. \nCOOPER There's something out there. \nThe cluster of lights grows as they are propelled closer: \nIt's a massive space station, built onto the surface of the sphere. \nEXT. SPACE STATION \nThe Endurance glides to a gentle stop on one of the upper decks of the space station. \nAfter a moment, the airlock to the ship opens and Cooper and the others step out, in their suits. \nThey walk up to the airlock doors of the station, which open automatically. \nINT. SPACE STATION \nAfter the airlock decompresses, the inner doors open. Standing there, waiting for them, is a familiar figure: \nTars. \nTARS (DEADPAN) I guess this isn't robot heaven after all. \nThe light on his brow glows and he offers them both a hand. \nINT. GRAND LABORATORY, SPACE STATION \nThe humans have taken off their space suits -- the station has been built to be habitable by humans -- and are following Tars through the massive facility. \nTARS I orbited the black hole seven times before I hit the second wormhole. Then I drifted until I found this place. \nCooper looks around. The halls are filled with countless technological wonders. \nCOOPER This is what the Chinese were protecting. (LOOKS AROUND) How they could have built all this in just a handful of years. \nTARS They didn't. It took them four thousand. (off Brand's look) Time moves very slowly here \nBRAND How do you know? \nTARS Because I've been waiting for you for three hundred years. \nBrand looks around at the massive facility. \nBRAND Time. That's what the bulk beings wanted to give us. That was the treasure the Chinese found. Enough time to let us save ourselves. \nBrand looks around. The facility is massive. She sets the specimen case down on a table. Even the tiny creature seems in awe of the place. \nINT. LABORATORY, SPACE STATION \nTars shows them a prototype for the gravity machine. It is tiny -- increasing G around two spheres that attract each other with a tiny force. \nTARS I have catalogued almost everything they had built here. \nCOOPER Must have taken you a while. \nTARS One hundred and fifty-seven years. \nCooper shakes his head in disbelief. \nCOOPER How are they keeping the lights on in this thing? \nTars, in answer, points to a far door. \nTARS Follow me. \nINT. ENGINE ROOM, SPACE STATION \nA massive reinforced-concrete shell shudders with the energy contained within it. The whole room HUMS with power. \nTars pulls up a display showing the inside of the shell: \nA tiny black hole spins, spewing out massive amounts of power. \nTARS It's a mini black hole. A remnant of the big bang. It will power this place forever. \nTars leads them on. \nEXT. HANGAR, SPACE STATION \nTars leads them past an incredibly sleek fleet of spacecraft. Cooper starts to stop, but Tars doesn't slow down. \nINT. SIMULATION ROOM \n", "test3_id": 2261}

INT. GAMMAGE & BURNHAM LAW OFFICES - WISCONSIN - NIGHT 
Rachel's doing paperwork at her desk. People leave. for the night. An attorney named MICHAEL approaches; warm, good- looking, by all standards, a catch. She doesn't look up. 
MICHAEL He's out of town. 
RACHEL Yup. 
MICHAEL Which seems like a perfect ;opportunity for a second date. In theory. 
RACHEL In theory -- but I gotta site-check this brief, courier's coming in,.,the morning. 
MICHAEL Didn't we have a good time? Remember that? Our first date? Back in the 40's? He's so agreeably genuine, she wants to let him down easy: 
RACHEL I had a great. time, I told you that but I'm so busy and... 
MICHAEL Ooo.o, shit, the "so busy" speech -- stop -- not worthy of you. Or me. I'm patient, so... call me. When you're not busy. 
RACHEL Kyle goes to college in nine years-- it should be somewhere around then. 
MICHAEL I would so wait a decade for you. Call me his sophomore year, I'll prove it. And with a smile he heads off. She watches him go -- dammit! really liking him in this moment. She watches longer than she should... then goes back to her work. He gets in the elevator and she's left in her solitude. And now we BEGIN TO SEE the first signs of it: loneliness.

RACHEL -- hello? It's the same chilling FEMALE VOICE:

AT THEIR DESK. 
RACHEL who is this? As she clicks on the link. And a STREAMING IMAGE APPEARS: A 
BLACK AND WHITE SURVEILLANCE CAM OFKYLE ON HIS TRAIN, LAUGHING WITH OTHER KIDS. Rachel's breath is taken away-- 
RACHEL (CONT'D) What's going on? Who are you --? 
WOMAN'S VOICE Would you risk your life for your son? Rachel jumps to her feet,: trying to breathe through the panic. Looking around. NO ONE - 
RACHEL This isn't funny! Who are you?! 
WOMAN'S VOICE Ican derail his train. I can kill him at any time. I'll ask again: would you risk`. your life for your son? Suddenly the BROWSER GOES BLANK: "UNABLE TO ACCESS PAGE." Kyle's taken from her, that fast -- she gasps, terrified. 
RACHEL yes... 
WOMAN'S VOICE Follow my instructions precisely. There's a vehicle parked at the northeast exit of your building. The keys are in the ignition. Start walking. Now. CLICK. Off Rachel's stunned, terrified face --

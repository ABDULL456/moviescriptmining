At her side is a PAPER SHREDDER, and between sips from a pi√±a colada, she feeds document after document, each one stamped BLACK WIDOW EVIDENCE in red ink... 
Kristen looks over at Elena, equally stunning in a matching bikini. 
KRISTEN I can't believe Morrison just handed me the key to the evidence locker... 
A broad grin stretches across her lips as Elena empties the contents of a velvet pouch onto a table. T he Mother-Daughter diamonds are radiant in the bright sunlight. 
KRISTEN These are...genuine? 
Elena nods. 
ELENA Nothin' like the real thing. Switched 'em for the fakes right after Marie tried to pay me off... 
KRISTEN They're...So beautiful. 
Elena picks up the bigger diamond, hands it to Kristen. 
ELENA The mother. 
Kristen picks up the smaller diamond, hands it to Elena. 
KRISTEN The daughter. 
INT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDINGS - DAY 
Morrison paces the infamous crime scene, at wit's end. Dammers stands off to the side, just watching him with a bemused look etched across his face. 
MORRISON She was the Black Widow. Her and that little... 
He tries to think of an appropriate slur for Elena. Can't come up with anything, continues pacing frantically. 
MORRISON Played me like a fool. 
Dammers shrugs. 
DAMMERS Hind sight's 20-20. No need to be so hard on yourself, Morrison... (beat, smile) That's my job. 
MORRISON You smug son of a bitch. It's not like you knew who she was anymore than I did. 
Dammers nods slowly. 
DAMMERS That's the God's honest truth. But at least I didn't give her my evidence locker keycard. 
DAMMERS(CONT'D) And I didn't lie about who fired the shots that killed the Clifford kid. 
Morrison's heart sinks. He looks like he's going to faint. Steadies himself, placing both hands against the wall, just as Jay did that fateful night seemingly a lifetime ago... 
EXT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDINGS - DAY 
Dammers leads Morrison to his awaiting car. They pass MR. Barajas and Cicatriz. Mr. Barajas is in his usual foul mood... 
MR. BARAJAS Un pinche sink hole! No lo puedo creer! 
Morrison stops, regards Barajas... 
MORRISON What did you say? 
CICATRIZ The foundation is sinking. The entire site is a sink hole. It's completely worthless. 
MR. BARAJAS I'm going to kill Jay Clifford... 
MORRISON You and me both... 
EXT. PARADISE - DAY 
Elena and Kristen lay side-by-side on loungers, soaking in the sun, when a voice rouses them... 
JAY (O.S.) Poor Detective Morrison. It's hard to do that to a friend. Especially one going through such a nasty divorce. 
They look up to see Jay, standing before them in a pair of colorful shorts, no shirt, sipping at a martini... 
JAY Told me he'd never trust another woman as long as he lived. And then along came a spider... 
KRISTEN A black widow. 
Jay glances at Elena, as he downs the last drops from his drink.

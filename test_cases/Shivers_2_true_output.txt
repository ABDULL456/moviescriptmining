TUDOR (soothingly) Attaboy. (closing his eyes in bliss and smiling again) Attaboy. 
In the living room, Janine suddenly realizes that if the TV set was on, Nick must be home. 
She gets to her feet and walks to the bedroom. 
Inside the bedroom, we see the door open. Light floods the room as Janine enters. Janine sees Tudor sprawled out on the bed. 
JANINE Nick? I didn't know you were home. What's wrong? What are you doing? You're almost falling out of bed. How are you feeling? 
Tudor twists around to see who has spoken, eyes wide but now unsmiling. With the same motion, he pulls the covers over his abdomen to hide the lumps from Janine. 
Janine stands at the bedroom door for an instant, then approaches the bedside. She moves as though her hands were tied at her sides, as though she is quite consciously holding herself together. 
JANINE (tenderly, but with caution, as though expecting a blow) Nick, does your stomach hurt? Can I see those bumps on your tummy, can I? 
She reaches out to pull back the covers again, but he rolls away from her. 
TUDOR Go away. Leave me alone. 
Janine straightens up. Her hands come up to her face and tears well up in her eyes. 
JANINE (frustrated) Oh, why won't you let me help you? 
She turns and walks angrily out of the room, slamming the door behind her. 
Tudor rolls over slowly on to his back, eyes wide and shining, smiling again. 
TUDOR (murmuring) Attaboy, attaboy. 
INT. EXAMINATION ROOM -- NIGHT 
St. Luc is examining a very pretty young girl who sits on the examination table in a hospital tunic. 
ST. LUC OK, Dotty. Everything else seems to be fine. Now if it gives you any trouble at all, any sharp pain, any unusual discharge, you come and see me right away. They can be tricky sometimes. 
Dotty nods. OK, you can get dressed. We're all through. 
The girl starts to get dressed. St. Luc scribbles something in her file and then takes it with him into the adjoining office, closing the door behind him.

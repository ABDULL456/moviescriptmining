They literally tear the office apart. 
INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY 
The FIRE is consuming the curtains. Thick, toxic SMOKE begins to fill the tiny apartment, and everyone starts coughing. 
INT.  APACHE HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY 
They circle, overwhelmed by the sheer number of apartments. 
CARSON (into radio) Apartment number would be real helpful, gang... 
Miranda points to a wisp of SMOKE above one of the towers. 
MIRANDA There! 
They come around, and spot the FIRE in the apartment's window. It is nine stories up, four stories below the top floor. 
EXT.  SKY ABOVE OCEAN - FOLLOW CRUISE MISSILE - DAY 
The coast looms closer. 
EXT.  PARK LA BREA - INCLUDE APACHE HELICOPTER - DAY 
The Apache hovers parallel to the apartment, 20 feet away. Carson feeds out a steel cable from a winch... 
Then throws a spring-loaded grappling hook onto the thick, iron balcony railing. 
Hanging onto a webbed rescue harness, Carson slides quickly across the line, onto the balcony. Using the butt of his Sig 9mm, he BREAKS a hole in the glass on the locked sliding glass door. He reaches through and unlatches it. 
INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY 
The FLAMES have engulfed both sets of curtains and have begun to creep across the floor and the ceiling. 
Carson glances over at the electronics on the TV: 4:55 PM. 
The family is coughing from the smoke, trying not to panic. 
In the kitchen, Lisa can't cough through the tape on her mouth. She's freaking out. 
Seeing this, Carson runs over to her and pulls the tape off. She starts SCREAMING, so he grabs her face. 
CARSON Okay... work with me here! 
He grabs one of the refrigerator handles and pulls, but it won't come loose. Lisa cries out in frustration. 
LISA Hurry, please hurry... 
Carson spots Javal's toolbox. In it, he finds a socket set handle, which he levers in between the refrigerator handle and the door. He rips one handle loose, then the other. 
Carson turns his attention to the booby-trapped chairs. 
Lisa sits on the floor, frantically pulling her handcuffed hands around her feet so they're in front of her, then runs for the front door. Just as she reaches it: 
CARSON DON'T! 
He grabs her before she opens the door. There's a small magnetic sensor at the top of the door jamb. 
CARSON (continuing) We have to go out the window. 
MRS. HAN Can't you disarm the bomb? 
CARSON Too risky. Let's concentrate on getting you out of here. 
He looks at the meters on the electronic units. 
CARSON (continuing) Sound detectors? 
MRS. HAN Sam covered them with chewing gum. 
SAM High-tech problem, low-tech solution. 
Carson looks at Sam, impressed, then peers under the chairs. 
CARSON Pressure sensors. Use 'em in convertibles: Bad guy sits on your seat, he sets the alarm off. These are rigged backwards -- get up, you set 'em off. 
SAM You a bomb expert? 
CARSON Nope. But I've had some car alarms in my day. (to himself) For all the goddamn good they do... 
Carson looks around, thinking. He spots the roll of duct tape on the table, grabs it and unrolls a long piece. 
CARSON (continuing; to Mrs. Han) Slide your arm forward... Watch the meter... Keep the pressure on the armrest with your elbow... 
He wraps the armrest with tape, cinching it tight. 
CARSON (continuing) It'll squeeze the sensor, duplicate the weight of your arm... Okay... pick it up. 
They look at each other, scared... After a beat, she does. 
The meter JIGGLES... but stays in the black! Everyone sighs with relief. Carson repeats the process on her other armrest. 
CARSON (continuing; to Sam) Low-tech solution... (to Mrs. Han) Lean back... Carefully. 
Carson feels for the sensor in the seat, finding it buried under Mrs. Han's thighs. He runs a long piece of tape around the seat and wraps it tightly.

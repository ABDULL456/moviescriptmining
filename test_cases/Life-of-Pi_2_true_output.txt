ADULT PI The way of karma; the way of God. 
WRITER I assumed your father was a mathematician - because of your name. 
ADULT PI Oh, far from it. I was named after a swimming pool. 
WRITER There's a swimming pool named 'Pi?' 
ADULT PI (He chuckles.) You see, my uncle, Francis, was born with too much water in his lungs. They say the doctor swung Francis around by the ankles to clear the water out and that's what gave him the huge chest and skinny legs that made him such a great swimmer. 
WRITER (Amused.) Is Francis actually your uncle? He said he was friends with your father. 
PI I call him 'Mamaji,' my 'honorary uncle' - my father's best friend, my swimming guru. 
6   EXT. ASHRAM SWIMMING POOL, PONDICHERRY, 1966 - DAY            6 
ADULT PI (V.O.) I trained with him three times a week at the ashram. His lessons would save my life in the end... 
A young Indian boy - PI AT AGE FIVE - surfaces from a pool, gasping. He looks up at the large chest and skinny legs of Mamaji (late 30s). Mamaji reaches down to scoop Pi out of the water. 
MAMAJI A mouthful of water will not harm you - but panic will. 
Mamaji carries Pi back over to the water's edge. 
MAMAJI (CONT'D) Remember to breathe. Don't hold your breath. Good boy. 
Mamaji unceremoniously tosses Pi back in. 
7   INT. PI'S HOME, KITCHEN, MONTREAL - DAY                       7 
ADULT PI (Regarding lunch:) I hope you don't mind vegetarian. 
WRITER No, not at all... And your name? 
ADULT PI Hmm? 
WRITER You - you were going to tell me how you got your name, I think. 
ADULT PI I got it from something Mamaji once told my father. Most travelers collect postcards or teacups on their journeys - but not Mamaji. Mamaji collects swimming pools. (MORE) 
ADULT PI (CONT'D) He swims in every pool he comes upon...

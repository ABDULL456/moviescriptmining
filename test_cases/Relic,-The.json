{"train": "\"The Relic\", early draft, by Amy Holden Jones \nRELIC \na screenplay by Amy Holden Jones \nbased on the book by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child \nMarch 16, 1995 \nTITLE CARD... BELEM BRAZIL - JULY... \nEXT. BELEM STREETS - NIGHT \nA taxi careens down narrow roadways at breakneck speeds. \nINT. TAXI - NIGHT \nIn the back seat is WHITTLESLEY. Early 40's, the wreck of a once handsome man. Unshaven.  Sweat stained.  Rail thin.  Scratches on his arms, a fresh scar on one cheek.  As the taxi roars downhill towards the harbor, Whittlesley leans over the front seat.  (Italics indicate Portuguese to be subtitled) \nWHITTLESLEY Faster!  We won't make it. \nDRIVER You want to die? \nWhittlesley pulls out A KNIFE, puts it to the driver's jugular vein. \nWHITTLESLEY Do you? \nSweat pouring down his brow, the driver re-doubles his speed. \nEXT. BELEM STREETS - NIGHT \nThe taxi swerves around a corner, nearly crashing into a fruit cart, flies out of sight. \nEXT. HARBOR - BELEM - NIGHT \nLight rain obscures the bulky outlines of tethered freighters.  We hear faint laughter leavened with Portuguese phrases, distant Calypso music from waterfront bars.  One of the smaller boats, the SANTA LUCIA, is loading as the TAXI fishtails to a halt. \nWhittlesley gets out, sees the boat still at dock.  His face floods with relief. \nWHITTLESLEY Thank God. \nHe tosses a handful of bills into the driver's lap, sprints up the pier as the driver shouts curses after him in Portuguese.  Whittlesley shoves past the dock hands as the last load goes onto the Santa Lucia. The boat's engines churn to life. \nWHITTLESLEY I need to speak to the captain! Where is he? \nThe sailors hold Whittlesley back. \nWHITTLESLEY Get your hands off me!  I'm trying to save your lives, you fools! \nSeveral crew members murmur the word \"loco\".  Hearing the commotion, a squat man wearing a billed hat and smoking a cigar approaches.  CAPTAIN FRANCO. \nFRANCO American? \nWHITTLESLEY Yes.  Thank Christ somebody speaks English.  I'm Dr. John Whittlesley. You have some crates of mine on board.  They were shipped by mistake to the Natural History Museum.  We have to get them off the boat. \nFRANCO You have I.D.? \nWhittlesley runs a trembling hand through his hair, trying to keep control and appear reasonable. \nWHITTLESLEY No.  Let me explain.  I was on an expedition for the museum on the Upper Xingu.  Something horrible happened.  I'm the only one who got out alive.  I lost everything, my I.D., everything.  I have to make sure no one else dies.  The crates, the crates were sent out before we knew.  There's something unspeakable inside.  If your boat leaves harbor with those crates on board, I can't be responsible.  My God, if they reach New York... \nWhittlesley's fists clench spasmodically.  Franco looks to his men. \nFRANCO Loco. \nWHITTLESLEY No!  I'm not crazy!  As God is my witness, I'm telling the truth. \nFranco barks an order and several sailors grab Whittlesley by the arms.  They start to lead him back to shore. \nWHITTLESLEY Don't do this!  You have to believe me.  Your lives are in danger. \nThe sailors laugh.  But with an almost super-human strength born of desperation, Whittlesley throws them off.  He pulls out his wallet. \nWHITTLESLEY Cash.  Cash, you see?  American money. \nWhittlesley throws the money down on the deck.  The breeze scatters the bills across the bow and all the men, including Captain Franco, scramble for the money, chattering in Portuguese.  While they are occupied, Whittlesley slips by unnoticed and disappears below deck. \nAnd the woman wearing the necklace... MARGO GREEN.  She sips her morning coffee as she makes notes on several large FOSSILIZED TEETH.  Her hair is neatly combed.  No make-up.  She doesn't need it.  She has a natural, unselfconscious beauty and a mind like a steel trap. \nAt Margo's elbow is a small T.V.  A CNN world news report plays. Margo's New York Times is open to the crossword puzzle, which she's been doing rapidly, in ink.  Clearly this is a woman who likes order, with a mind that can handle more than one thing at a time. \nAn alarm on her watch beeps and she fills in the last two lines of the crossword puzzle, makes one final note on the fossil specimens, and shuts off the T.V.  She reaches for her back pack and looks out at CENTRAL PARK with remarkably clear eyes. \nEXT. CENTRAL PARK - MORNING \nHELICOPTER SHOT... Swooping over the fall foliage of the Park, a riot of color and botanical life... The camera picks out MARGO'S BICYCLE making its way along the winding roads, dodging taxi cabs.  Margo wears jeans, a work shirt, a fine blue gabardine jacket with a rhinestone DOUBLE HELIX PIN.  On her back is a LEATHER BACK PACK which holds her lap top computer.  She emerges from the park, catches the green light and rolls up to... \nEXT. MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY - DAY \nAs Margo arrives, the camera moves up and over the building, comes to rest on the imposing turrets, intersecting roof lines, and Gothic arches of the MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY.  This is not an ordinary building; it's a 19th century monument to science and mankind.  The structure fills an entire city block. \nHappy visitors pour into the museum as Margo takes the imposing wide stone steps two at a time.  We hear SCREAMS of pleasure and release, the normal raucous noises of a large group of THIRD GRADE CHILDREN. Margo is amused to find herself surrounded by kids.  Their teacher, MRS. BEASLEY, a stern woman in glasses with a thick New York accent, calls after them as they all head inside. \nMRS. BEASLEY Don't run, children!  Stay with your partner and do not run!  If anyone runs they will be sent back to the bus! \nIgnoring Mrs. Beasley, TWO BOYS charge past Margo.  HENRY and LARRY. Henry has a buzz cut; Larry has rasta dread knots.  Both are 8 years old, wear high top sneakers and shorts so big they graze their ankles. \nMRS. BEASLEY Henry!  Larry!  What did I just say! You walk right this minute!  Did you hear me?! \nReluctantly, Henry and Larry slow to a rapid race-walk as they reach the huge doorway flanked by two Northwest Coast Indian totem poles. Above the doorway WORKMEN are hanging a LARGE BANNER.  It reads: \"SUPERSTITION EXHIBIT... OPENING OCT. 29\" \nINT. MUSEUM ROTUNDA/STAIRWELL - DAY \nThe school children burst into a three story space dominated by a life-sized statue of a HERD OF ELEPHANTS.  The kids chatter with excitement, look up in awe.  Margo nods to a GUARD who smiles as she pins on a plastic I.D. \nGUARD Morning, Dr. Green. \nMARGO Morning Joe.  Beautiful day. \nHenry watches Margo pass through the turnstiles without paying.  He swaggers over. \nHENRY You work here? \nMARGO Yes, I do. \nHENRY What do you do? \nMARGO (leans down, amused) I'm an Evolutionary Biologist.  What do you do? \nHENRY Nothing.  I'm in third grade.  What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit? \nMARGO Evolutionary Biologist.  I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years. \nHENRY (brightens) Way cool.  Then you know where the dinosaurs are. \nMARGO Fourth floor, West wing, but stay with your class. \nMrs. Beasley heads into the museum and Larry and Henry merge with the rest of the kids.  Margo turns towards the stairwell, passing... \nIAN CUTHBERT... Museum Director... a pudgy man in wire rim glasses who dresses and thinks like a banker.  Hired for his amazing ability to raise money, Cuthbert is one of a new generation of Museum Directors whose focus must always be on the bottom line. \nMARGO Hello, Ian.  Everything ready for the opening of the Superstition Exhibit? \nCUTHBERT I'm on my way to get the last piece out of storage right now. \nMARGO I'd wish you luck but I'm not superstitious. \nCUTHBERT You will be after tomorrow night. \nCuthbert waves merrily.  A workman uses a LADDER in the stairwell. Cuthbert is about to walk under the ladder, stops and carefully walks around it instead.  Margo smiles, goes on upstairs. \nINT. MUSEUM BASEMENT - DAY \nCuthbert enters from the lower stairwell.  He is now in one of the hundreds of areas of the museum that are closed to the the general public.  He follows a labyrinthine route down a dim passageway lined with rumbling steam pipes.  There are storage areas on both sides labeled ORNITHOLOGY, HERPITOLOGY, CENTRAL ASIA EXPEDITIONS, AKELEY EXPEDITIONS, WHALE BONE FOSSILS and so on.  Finally Cuthbert comes to a door marked \n\"WHITTLESLEY EXPEDITIONS 1978-95\".  Cuthbert pauses and gets out a key, but to his surprise the door pushes open.  The lock and doorknob mechanism are both broken off!  Cuthbert frowns. \nCUTHBERT What the... ? \nHe goes inside. \nINT. WHITTLESLEY COLLECTION BASEMENT - DAY \nCuthbert flips on a light to see a tall, narrow space.  Stacks of metal shelves reach up into the gloom.  Everywhere we see spears, shields, masks, various artifacts.  Ancient tribal costumes lie shrouded in plastic like corpses against the walls.  And in the middle of the gloom, sitting ominously in the light of a sole hanging bulb are... \nINT. FROCK'S OFFICE - DAY \nMargo bursts into the unique office, which is in startling contrast to the modernity of her own.  Two large bow windows look out over the park.  Upholstered Victorian chairs in a leaf motif sit on needlepoint carpets featuring large red roses.  Plant specimens and drawings of flora and fauna line the walls.  Cardboard boxes cover the floor. Seated in a wheelchair is a white-haired man in a tweed jacket and a loud floral tie.  Glasses slip down his nose. \nThis is DR. FROCK, and he's in the middle of packing.  He looks up, smiles apologetically. \nDR. FROCK Hello, Margo.  Sorry about the mess. \nMARGO Is it true?  Greg said you'd been fired. \nFROCK Yes.  Bit of a shock.  But as Cuthbert so tactfully put it, the museum needs new blood.  And since I've been here since the Mesozoic Era -- \nMARGO I don't believe it. \nFROCK Now Margo, don't overreact.  Cuthbert has to cut costs somehow.  My leaving makes perfect sense.  This isn't exactly early retirement.  I've overstayed the party a bit. \nMARGO We can't do without you.  You're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology.  You're practically an institution around here. \nFROCK That, apparently, is the problem. I'm yesterday's news.  Who needs a Curator of Plant Biology in a museum with one exhibit on plants?  Monsters and dinosaurs, cannibals and shamans are the new currency of the realm. \nFrock goes back to his work packing to hide his emotion and Margo moves to his side.  She pulls Frock's books back out of the box, returns them to his desk. \nMARGO \"Phyletic Transformation and the Tertiary Fern Spike\" is not going anywhere.  I'll talk to Cuthbert and put a stop to this right now. \nShe starts for the door and Frock wheels into her path.  Now for the first time she sees what he's been carefully hiding... the deep pain in his eyes. \nFROCK Please.  Don't humiliate me further. \nMARGO Let me help.  I can take care of everything. \nFROCK No, Margo.  This is one problem you can't solve.  You have to stay out of it.  The fact is, I want to retire. \nMARGO How can you say that?  You know it's not true. \nFROCK Yes it is.  I'm tired and I'm no longer needed -- \nMARGO My work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you. \nFROCK With all due respect, dear, that's bull.  You dance rings around me with your new technology.  You've left me in the dust. \nMARGO (stubbornly loyal) Your work is highly relevant.  What about your display on Primitive Pharmacology?  Cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the Superstition Exhibit. \nFROCK Healing plant use among the Ki tribe of Bechuanaland has been cancelled to make room for Tibetan Erotic Art. \nFrock reaches out and squeezes her hand gently with a look that says the discussion is over. \nFROCK Come on.  I'll walk you back to the elevator. \nMARGO I'm not giving up. \nFROCK You must. \nINT. MUSEUM HALLWAYS - DAY \nFrock rolls back down the hall the way Margo just came.  Margo is beside him, downcast.  She's not used to defeat. \nFROCK This isn't a death sentence.  Greg has promised to teach me fly fishing.  I'll garden.  I'll write. \nMARGO You are this museum.  It won't be the same without you. \nFROCK Everyone needs a change of scenery. I've been rolling down these halls for forty-odd years.  That's quite enough. \nMargo gets in the elevator reluctantly.  He smiles and meets her eye. \nFROCK I'll see you at lunch. \nHe waves her off merrily.  But once the doors close and Margo's out of sight, Frock's smile fades and his shoulders sag.  He ducks his wheelchair quickly into the Hall of African Mammals. \nINT. HALL OF AFRICAN MAMMALS - AFTERNOON \nTwo stories high, dark and dramatic.  A very special display.  Dioramas of lions, hippos, wart hogs etc.  In the middle is a large statue of a GORILLA beating its chest.  Frock takes refuge in the darkness of the exhibit.  His wheelchair sits in a quiet corner and we see him quickly wipe the back of his hands across his eyes. \nINT. MOLLUSKS EXHIBIT - DAY \nShells and sea life line the walls.  A sign announces the exhibit \"Mollusks and Our World.\"  The THIRD GRADE CLASS sweeps in.  Larry and Henry start to sing \"Mollusks and Our World\" to the tune of \"Welcome to Our World\", the F.A.O. Schwartz theme song.  Mrs. Beasley shoots them the evil eye and Henry whines... \nHENRY Mrs. Beasley, it's almost time to go and we still haven't seen the dinosaurs! \nLARRY What is it? \nHENRY I don't know.  But I think it's bad. \nThey keep their eyes locked on the shape at the end of the hall as they back up, step by step.  Move in as their faces suddenly TWIST WITH FEAR.  THE BOYS... SCREAM BLOODY MURDER... The sound echoes in the darkness as we... \nCUT TO: \nINT. MARGO'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nMargo sits up in the darkness, gasping.  Moonlight cuts across the bed. It takes a moment for her to realize that she's had a nightmare.  She reaches for her light.  As she switches it on, we see a photo on her bedside table.  It shows a group on a mountain in TIBET.  There are several people with their arms slung around each other.  At the end is a younger MARGO holding hands with JOHN WHITTLESLEY.  They appear to be more than friends. \nON MARGO... she looks at the photo a moment, then turns off the light and lies back, alone in her bed. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST - DAY \nYellow crime tape encircles the museum.  Dead leaves swirl in clusters and the sky is overcast.  Overnight, fall turned to winter.  The front of the museum is ringed with police cars.  Margo rides up on her bike and pauses, startled at the sight.  We watch as she crosses, has a few words with one of the officers who motions her to a side entrance.  She wheels her bike under a stone tunnel as we pick up... \nA TAXI CAB arriving at the front entrance.  Out steps SPECIAL AGENT PENDERGAST. \nINT. LOWER ROTUNDA - DAY \nMargo enters.  The huge hall is taken up by an enormous boat carved from the trunk of a single tree.  Inside it are mannequins of Northwest Coast Indians.  Milling around are at least twenty COPS.  One approaches. \nCOP ID. \nWorried, Margo hands it over. \nMARGO What's going on? \nCOP All employees are to go to the IMAX room for a briefing, Dr. Green. \nINT. SIDE HALL - MUSEUM - DAY \nSeveral cops go by with tracking dogs.  Margo looks back at the dogs, increasingly uneasy, almost bumps into... \nHENRY AND LARRY.  Surprisingly, they are alive and well and seated with MRS. BEASLEY outside an office.  Margo exchanges a look with both boys, remembering them from yesterday.  A tentative smile starts but Henry and Larry don't return it.  Serious and chastened, they drop their eyes.  Margo continues on. \nTWO COPS stand outside the door to the rest room, their backs turned to Margo as she approaches. \nCOP ONE What was that?  Six? \nCOP TWO Lost count. \nMargo glances past them to see an OLDER MAN wearing the badge of a NIGHT WATCHMAN, leaning over a sink.  He wipes his mouth.  Margo's eyes move down to see... THE MAN'S SNEAKERS are soaked in blood. \nINT. HALL OF ADVANCED FOSSIL MAMMALS - DAY \nMore cops gather, surrounded by skeletons of primates... humans, monkeys, gorillas.  It's an odd sight.  They all look up with interest as in walks the imposing figure of... \nSPECIAL AGENT PENDERGAST.  He turns to a young eager beaver, OFFICER BAILEY, flashes his badge.  Bailey straightens to attention. \nPENDERGAST Could you please take me to the officer in charge? \nINT. CIRCULAR STAIRWELL - DAY \nPendergast follows Bailey as they descend the rickety old metal staircase that goes into the bowels of the museum.  The hall below them is narrowand lit by an occasional bare bulb.  The stairway opens onto a maze-like set of rooms in the basement.  Everything around them is STREAKED and SPATTERED in BLOOD.  There are trails of it on the floor, the walls, the overhead light. \nSeveral COPS stand guard as DETECTIVE VINCE D'AGOSTA goes over the area.  He is a round, balding, man with an unmistakable air of authority.  A modern knight in shining armor in disguise... deep disguise.  He has on a cheap polyester short sleeved shirt.  His t-shirt is plainly visible underneath.  On his worn plastic belt is a badge. \nD'AGOSTA Don't touch anything until the S.O.C.  has finished with those stairs.  Keep everyone clear of the perimeter.  I don't want any contamination.  There's an incredible amount of blood evidence down here. We need more light.  Where's the photographer?  Tell him to quit eating donuts, I need him. \nAs Pendergast enters, D'Agosta looks up at this serious African- American in simple black suit, white shirt and dark tie. \nD'AGOSTA Who are you?  The undertaker? \nPENDERGAST Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI. \nD'AGOSTA Vince D'Agosta.  Am I out? \nPENDERGAST Not at all.  I think we may be working on the same case.  If so, I could use your help. \nThe two men shake hands.  They couldn't be more different.  Pendergast is an elegant intellectual... D'Agosta a working class spark plug who operates from the gut.  Pendergast gestures to the form on the ground. \nPENDERGAST The body? \nPENDERGAST I ran an internet search on Dr. Whittlesley.  Got a list of his scholarly articles and the engagement announcement in the Times.  I also found a record of your restraining order. \nMARGO That was two years ago.  John was still in love with me. (she looks down) He wouldn't leave me alone. \nPENDERGAST You were afraid of him, weren't you? \nMARGO He was afraid of himself.  He tried suicide once.  He was ill.  Manic depressive.  He had wild emotional highs and lows.  Not a happy affliction for a scientist.  He'd been revered in our community.  By the end he was a joke. \nPENDERGAST Tell me about the last expedition. What was he looking for? \nMARGO A legendary monster called Mbwun. \nPENDERGAST A monster? \nMARGO Yes.  He developed his own theory that he called the Calisto Effect. It held that evolution wasn't always gradual or driven by natural selection.  The environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a \"monster species\".  It made no sense. But he felt he had evidence that Mbwun was such a monster, living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years. \nPENDERGAST What happened? \nMARGO No one knows.  The Kothoga who live on the tepui are cannibals. \nMargo's voice catches again.  Pendergast reaches for his handkerchief but she shakes her head, determined to keep control. \nMARGO No.  I'm all right.  I won't let this affect me anymore.  John wouldn't get help.  His ego endangered the lives of others.  His theory came first. \nPENDERGAST What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there?  Was he desperate enough to create one? \nMARGO I don't understand. \nPENDERGAST Something came up in autopsy tonight.  Imbedded in Beauregard's body we found a claw. \nMARGO My God.  Then it was an animal. \nPENDERGAST I don't think so.  I think we were meant to think it was Mbwun.  Did Whittlesley's monster have claws? \nMARGO I don't know.  He sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation.  But I've never seen it.  It's in the exhibit. \nPENDERGAST Would you mind showing it to me? \nINT. SUPERSTITION EXHIBIT - NIGHT \nThis exhibit is unlike anything we've seen in the museum.  Horrifying artifacts under single spots appear to float in a velvet blackness. Patterns of light and shadow play over skeletons and voodoo dolls. There are tombs, a torture chamber, and endlessly curving, maze-like, winding halls. \nPENDERGAST Where would we find it? \nMARGO I'm not sure.  We should split up. You take that hall and I'll take this one. \nPENDERGAST All right.  I'm as macho as you are. Perhaps. \nWithout further discussion, Margo takes the right fork leaving Pendergast behind. \nON MARGO... \nAs she finds herself alone.  The silence is intense.  She heads slowly into another long, dark, tunnel passing a set of Maori tattooed heads. The eyes are stuffed with fibers, the shriveled lips are drawn back from rotting teeth.  Margo passes without a look. \nON PENDERGAST \nIn another part of the exhibit, he nears a Mayan tomb.  A skeleton in the center wears a headdress and tribal robes.  Gold rings encircle bony fingers.  Pendergast takes a moment to appreciate it, heads into the next hall. \nON MARGO \ngetting farther from pendergast, and ever deeper into the gloom.  The walls around her are lined with symbols of witchcraft.  There are shaman dancers, masks covered in grasses and shells.  From the New Guinea coast there is Kokpah, God of a secret male society, and Zoe- ba, an awesome mannequin in black costume with an angry pointed mask. \nFinally the walls open up into another gallery.  Beyond it is more of the shadowy hall.  Margo stops and for the first time she wavers.  This gallery is the most frightening yet.  It features images of THE DEVIL from different cultures around the world. \nIn the dim light, Margo is dwarfed by abhorrent statues of SATAN, TORNARSUK (the Eskimo evil spirit), INCUBI from India, Tibet, New Guinea etc.  And there in the center of the gallery sitting on an altar and lit by a spot, is a small figurine.  Margo is instantly drawn to it.  As she gets close enough she sees the label in Gothic letters. \nMBWUN \nSavage God of the Kothoga, also known as \"HE WHO WALKS ON ALL FOURS\". \nThe statue is terrifyingly life-like.  Margo stares at The Beast.  Mbwun is covered in scales and stiff hair, with glittering green eyes and crude, reptilian features.  The figure is hunched over in a threatening crouch.  It's long forearms trail to the ground ending in THREE LARGE CLAWS! \nON MARGO... she starts, then remembers Pendergast. \nMARGO Mr. Pendergast!  I found it. \nNo answer.  She turns, tries again, louder. \nMARGO I didn't imagine it.  I know what I saw.  Are you sure there are enough men in there? \nPENDERGAST They're all heavily armed. \nMARGO (stops) All right.  This is hard for me.  I'm a scientist.  I like order and logic. Sometimes too much.  There's got to be an explanation.  There can't be an animal in there.  But I saw something. \nPENDERGAST What was it? \nMARGO I don't know. (she has a thought) Mr. Pendergast.  Do me a favor.  Get me a DNA readout on that claw. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT \nAll is quiet. \nINT. MUSEUM FRONT - EXHIBIT FRONT DOOR - NIGHT \nThe doors to the exhibit are closed.  Doyle looks at his watch, impatient.  It's almost eleven now.  He pulls out his walkie talkie. \nDOYLE Bailey?  Doyle here.  I'm still waiting outside the exhibit.  Where the hell is McNitt? \nBAILEY Should be there any minute.  They came out a side door a while ago. Said the exhibit's clear.  McNitt's headed back to spell you. \nDOYLE I'm on double over-time, man. \nBAILEY I know.  You can go home if you want to.  I'll come relieve you myself. \nDoyle shuts off his walkie talkie, frowns.  He fidgets, looks at his watch once more. \nDOYLE What the hell. \nHe turns, takes off the walkie talkie and leaves it, but then he hears something, stops.  It's a low SCUFFLING from inside the exhibit, coming from behind the closed doors.  Doyle freezes, turns. \nDOYLE McNitt? \nNo answer.  Doyle pauses.  His hand goes to his gun for reassurance as he hears a footstep and a muffled thump.  He moves to the door of the exhibit, opens it and takes a step inside. \nDOYLE McNitt?  Cut the crap.  I know it's you.  You're not scaring me.  Come on. \nSilence meets him.  The shadows of the exhibit loom.  Doyle takes one more step inside, scanning the darkness with his gun.  Does he hear BREATHING?  He freezes.  Yes, he does.  The hair on his neck rises and he loses the spit in his mouth.  He takes a step backwards, but he's half a second too late.  The door SLAMS BEHIND HIM and a HUGE DARK FORM LEAPS OUT! \nINT. EXHIBIT ENTRANCE - NIGHT \nOfficer MCNITT enters from a side corridor, zipping up his fly.  The hall is still.  McNitt checks his watch, sees Doyle's walkie talkie and turns it on. \nMCNITT McNitt here.  I'm outside the exhibit.  All's quiet.  But I don't see Doyle. \nBAILEY (OS) He called a minute ago looking for you.  He starts vacation tomorrow and he wanted out.  I said you were on the way.  He could split. \nMCNITT Well he's gone. \nBAILEY (OS) Any sign of a green-eyed monster? \nMCNITT (chuckles) Nope. \nMcNitt shuts off the walkie talkie, settles at his post. \nINT. SUPERSTITION EXHIBIT - NIGHT \nIn the blackness a large shape is MOVING QUIETLY, dragging it's prey across the floor.  We move in on the lifeless form of DOYLE.  His face is rigid with terror, his eyes frozen, open wide.  The last thing we hear as the hulking form heads back into the darkness, is the SNAPPING of Doyle's skull. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. MUSEUM - DAY \nSigns announce that the Superstition Exhibit opens tonight.  The museum is back in business, but not many people are going in.  A crowd lingers at the margins, pointing at the building.  Several hold a copy of the POST with a graphic photo of the bloody floor by the circular stair. \nINT. CUTHBERT'S OFFICE - DAY \nCuthbert stands by the window of his palatial office, looking out at the scene below.  His face is pinched with worry.  Slumped in a chair is Lieutenant D'Agosta.  Pendergast surveys some paintings on the wall. \nPENDERGAST I had no idea the Museum had a complete collection of Piranesi's Forum sketches. \nCUTHBERT If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block. \nPENDERGAST I've read about the Museum's financial troubles. \nHeaded down.  D'Agosta chews on a toothpick, stares at Karl's home-made picture show.  The photos have all been cut from nature magazines.  They are of ANIMALS MATING in extreme positions and undreamed of ways. D'Agosta turns to Pendergast, dead pan. \nD'AGOSTA My kind of art. \nKarl, who is sixty and wears a red toupee, leers. \nKARL They keep me company.  Gets kinda lonely sometimes. \nD'AGOSTA My favorite is the two camels. \nKARL Really?  I'm partial to the skunks. \nFinally the doors open and they exit to a hail, enter another set of doors.  Now they are in \nINT. OSTEOLOGICAL PREPARATION AREA - DAY \nIt looks more like a bizarre industrial kitchen than anything else. Deep stainless steel tanks line one wall.  On the ceiling near the tanks hang massive pulleys and grappling hooks for the larger carcasses.  In a far corner of the workshop is a stainless-steel gurney bearing a DEAD GORILLA.  A pink faced eighty year old man is working on the carcass with sharp tools.  This is DON OSTERBAAN. \nFROCK Did you ever wonder where we get all our skeletons?  This is the laboratory where animal carcasses are reduced to bones. (to Osterbaan) What's cooking today, Don? \nDON Zebra. \nFrock looks into a large maceration tank with Pendergast and D'Agosta. A zebra carcass can be seen under the muddy surface, its flesh and soft tissues falling off. \nD'AGOSTA Man, that's ripe. \nFrock now opens the door on a humid closet adjacent to the main room. Inside on a stainless steel table lies the corpse of a fox.  It's crawling with BLACK BEETLES which are devouring it.  D'Agosta and Pendergast watch the grizzly scene, properly impressed. \nFROCK Dermestid beetles.  The second method of preparing a skeleton, used in Natural History Museums world wide. Bugs are clean and highly efficient. They'll polish that fox off in no time. \nAs Don casually peels back the gorilla's whole face exposing the skull... \nOSTERBAAN Want to have a look at a gorilla brain?  Got one right here. \nFROCK Thanks Don.  We're in a hurry.  Some other time. \nINT. HALLWAY - DAY \nMore rows of stainless steel doors under hissing steam pipes.  The light is dim here, and several bulbs are burned out.  But the numbers on the storage rooms are much higher now.  The three men come out of the darkness.  Frock rounds a last corner and wheels to a stop. \nFROCK This should be it.  Can you read the number? \nPendergast reaches up above them and TAPS THE LIGHT BULB.  It comes on and they all see the heavy steel door of the storage area.  D'Agosta's jaw drops and his toothpick falls out.  The door has been scored from top to bottom by long, vicious, CLAWS! \nD'AGOSTA Holy shit. \nFrock stares in amazement, shaken.  He runs a finger down the deep ruts. \nFROCK Something tried to get into this room! \nPENDERGAST And failed.  These doors are solid steel. \nFROCK This means there must be an animal loose in the museum! \nPENDERGAST I wouldn't be so sure. \nPendergast takes Frock's keys and opens the door.  It swings wide on oiled hinges.  D'Agosta turns on a light. \nINT. STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT \nThey all enter.  Nothing has been disturbed.  The crates sit in the middle of the small room, untouched.  Pendergast kneels by the only one that's been opened. \nPENDERGAST This must be the one that held the statue.  Let's see what else is inside. \nPendergast removes the lid and hands it to D'Agosta, pulls out a BLOW DART GUN, SEED PODS, a CARVED STONE.  D'Agosta takes the lid and turns it. \nD'AGOSTA The lid of this crate is scratched with claw marks, just like the door. \nAs D'Agosta studies the lid, a brittle, water damaged envelope slips out.  D'Agosta picks it up.  The envelope bears an imprint of TWO ARROWS, one silver overlaid with another of GOLD. \nD'AGOSTA Look.  It's some kind of letter. \nFROCK (excited) May I see that? \nD'Agosta hands the letter to Frock. \nFROCK It's from John.  Those two arrows were his insignia.  It's addressed to Louis Moriarty, a patron who financed his expeditions. \nThe place looks like the control room of a nuclear power plant.  Two SECURITY GUARDS monitor a battery of closed-circuit screens.  D'Agosta is now accompanied by the pompous head of security, IPPOLITO.  Clearly Ippolito feels D'Agosta is pissing on his territory and he's trying to assert control. \nIPPOLITO This huge police presence tonight isn't necessary, Lieutenant.  You'll just scare people off.  I can handle the security behind scenes with this system.  It's state of the art. \nD'AGOSTA The cops are non-negotiable, Ippolito.  Why don't you just tell me how this space station works. \nIPPOLITO It's fool proof, basically.  I designed this whole thing myself. Every valuable object in the Museum carries a small electronic chip.  If anything's moved so much as an inch, we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted theft. \nD'AGOSTA That's great if you're stopping a burglar.  Not our goal here.  Are there motion detectors? \nIPPOLITO In every exhibition room.  The museum's divided into five cells. The reception and exhibit are in cell five.  We could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four, then seal the perimeter with our fire doors. \nD'AGOSTA That would leave one exit for hundreds of people.  You'd be violating every fire regulation on the books.  We'll guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells.  One more question.  I see a big hole.  If this entire thing is run by computer, what happens if the power fails? \nIPPOLITO (snorts) You don't know much about computers, Lieutenant.  There are safeguards built in.  We have back-up systems with redundancies.  There's no way these computers can fail. \nINT. PHYSICAL ANTHRO LAB - DAY \nMargo, Kawakita and Frock are studying the contents of the crate. \nFROCK I can't help thinking there's something that Pendergast overlooked.  If the scratches were made by whatever killed Beauregard, it wants something that's in here. \nMARGO A blow dart.  Seed pods.  A plant press.  Pretty unimpressive stuff. \nFROCK Let me see the plant press. \nFrock opens the plant press and sees a specimen inside. \nMARGO What is it? \nFROCK I'm not sure.  As you know, the Kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. Species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct.  This could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant. \nMARGO Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui.  John used it as packing material. \nFROCK You're right. \nKawakita lifts out a bit of the fibers, as does Frock. \nFROCK They're curiously fleshy. \nKAWAKITA And they smell delicious. \nKawakita TAKES a NIBBLE. \nKAWAKITA Taste great. \nFROCK I wouldn't put that in your mouth until we do a chemical analysis, Greg. \nKAWAKITA I can handle that for you while we're waiting on the G.S.E. \nKawakita rises and exits with some of the plant. \nMARGO What about those seed pods?  Are they from the same plant? \nFrock takes a moment to study them, looks up. \nFROCK Margo, these aren't seed pods. \nMARGO What are they? \nFROCK They're eggs. \nINT. SUB-BASEMENT - DAY \nBlack as night.  The only light comes from the men's flashlights. They're at a crossroads.  Crooked corridors, with arched ceilings barely the height of a man stretch in several directions.  Jonathan is crouched down, resting with the panting dogs.  The deputies are having a smoke.  They all look both uneasy and exhausted except for Pendergast.  He stares at the blueprints. \nPENDERGAST Hard to read in this light.  The ink is so faded. \nJONATHAN The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast.  Maybe we should head back. \nPENDERGAST Not yet.  Let's try the fork to the left. \nThe men reluctantly shoulder their shotguns and push on.  The hounds walk ahead, carelessly nosing the ground.  The flashlight beams illuminate lime-encrusted, cave-like walls. \nDEPUTY TWO This place gives me the creeps. \nAt this the dogs begin to WHINE.  The HAIR on their backs rises in a ridge.  Pendergast turns as a BREEZE stirs his clothes. \nPENDERGAST I'm ordering you!  Cover me! \nDEPUTY TWO We'll cover you from here! \nJonathan is disappearing in front of them.  Pendergast has no choice. Grim faced, he pulls his Colt .45 Anaconda from a shoulder harness. It's a narrow and evil-looking gun.  From a pocket comes a handful of 255 grain wadcutter and 147 grain FMJ flatnose ammunition.  He loads up, goes after Jonathan, who's no longer in sight.  Pendergast passes down a long, sloping hallway into cavernous blackness ahead.  At the bottom Pendergast stops.  He has to stoop down as he goes through an archway and into... \nA VAST ARCHING ROOM... \nA dark stream of water runs between concrete walls with tunnels going off from all sides.  It appears to be part of the sewer system.  The dog cowers in a corner.  Jonathan moves to his side. \nJONATHAN Look.  It's Hobbes!  He's all right. \nPENDERGAST Come on.  Let's get back to the others.  We can't leave them alone. \nJONATHAN It's alright.  I can tell by the way the dog's acting that whatever was out there is gone.  What is this place? \nPENDERGAST Not on the map.  Looks like it connects with the city sewer. \nPendergast calls back down the tunnel for the deputies. \nPENDERGAST We're coming back! \nThe words go unanswered.  From the hall comes a loud REPORT.  It's the shotguns, blasting desperately.  Something flies up all around them as the sound echoes.  BATS! \nPendergast and Jonathan shield themselves from the flurry of beating wings.  Finally the animals settle and Pendergast and Jonathan exchange a look.  The silence is filled by a soft RUMBLING SOUND.  They stand together, waiting.  Pendergast points his gun at the hall leading back to the deputies.  A ridge of hair on the dog's back rises and it growls. \nPENDERGAST Identify yourself!  Who's there? \nNo answer.  The rumbling continues, growing louder.  Then a dark object appears.  It comes rolling out of the hallway, bounces in front of them and stops.  Pendergast shines his light on... \nDEPUTY ONE'S HEAD!  The mouth is open wide in terror.  Across the cheek is a vicious claw mark. \nJONATHAN Oh... my... God! \nPENDERGAST (hisses) Quiet. \nAnd now they hear a GUT WRENCHING SHRIEK that's abruptly cut off, followed by a second rumbling sound!  Jonathan grabs Pendergast by the shirt, panicked. \nPENDERGAST Stay calm. \nThey head quietly for the exit at the other end of room which seems to slope up.  After they're gone a few moments the head of DEPUTY TWO rolls to a stop. \nEXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT \nCabs and limousines tangle outside the west entrance.  A huge rotating SPOTLIGHT is now turned on.  Elegantly dressed men in dinner jackets and women in gowns rush to get out of the pelting rain, umbrellas jousting. \nINT. CUTHBERT'S OFFICE - EVENING \nCuthbert's putting on his tux.  He adjusts the cummerbund, humming happily as D'Agosta looks on.  D'Agosta paces, highly agitated and worried. \nD'AGOSTA I'm telling you, something's wrong. I still haven't heard from Pendergast.  I think you should call it off. \nCUTHBERT It's too late now.  Guests are arriving.  The Mayor's car is pulling up. \nD'AGOSTA I'll go down and speak to him. \nCUTHBERT (irritated) You haven't got the authority.  Only Pendergast can pull the plug. \nD'AGOSTA Pendergast may be in trouble.  Don't you understand?  He still hasn't come back.  It's been over three hours -- \nCUTHBERT He'll be back.  Relax.  We're in good shape.  Your security is air tight. There've been no more incidents, nothing suspicious.  There's no reason to call off the opening now. \nINT. GREAT ROTUNDA - NIGHT \nResounding with the echoes of several hundred expensive shoes crossing the marble expanse and heading down the rows of palm trees leading to the Hall of Heavens.  The palms themselves are festooned with orchids and violet lights.  Somewhere inside, an invisible band is playing \"New York, New York\".  An army of waiters in white tie thread their way through the guests carrying large silver platters crowded with champagne glasses.  Cuthbert enters and crosses to meet The MAYOR and THE MAYOR'S WIFE.  Photographers step forward and flashbulbs pop. \nINT. HALL OF THE HEAVENS - NIGHT \nFood is out.  Hundreds of tables are set with black linen table cloths. Decorations have a dark, haunted house theme.  A hum of activity floats up past the vast Corinthian columns into the circular dome above. \nINT. MARGO'S LABORATORIES - NIGHT \nAn explosive sneeze rattles the beakers and dislodges the plant specimens.  Margo interrupts her work at the computer to hand Greg a tissue as Frock looks on. \nKAWAKITA What kind of egg is it? \nMARGO It's reptilian. \nFROCK It's like ringing the dinner bell. \nINT. ENTRANCE TO SUPERSTITION EXHIBIT - ROTUNDA - NIGHT \nThe crowd is now packed into the rotunda as the MAYOR cuts a red ribbon across the entrance to the exhibit and everyone applauds. Cuthbert is by the mayor's side.  He steps forward and raises his hand for quiet.  The crowd falls silent. \nCUTHBERT Thank you everyone and welcome. We're glad all of you were willing to brave the inclement weather to be with us tonight.  Our special thanks to his honor, the mayor and his lovely wife. \nThe Mayor takes a bow.  More applause. \nCUTHBERT (CON'T) Some people have questioned whether a superstition exhibit belongs in a Museum of Science.  Spells, incantations, demons, magic... these are forces that defy the natural laws.  Superstition provides answers to the great questions based on fear.  Science provides answers to the great questions based on truth. Science and superstition, then, are polar opposites.  Mortal enemies, if you will.  And that is why we are here tonight.  We have come to learn more about the enemy, and thus to bring about its defeat.  For every good, there is an evil, for every dark, a light.  And so tonight... my friends, I give you ignorance, terror, unreasoning fear, pure evil. (smiles, gestures to the exhibit) Have a great time. \nEveryone laughs, applauds again as Cuthbert and the Mayor lead the way inside.  Kawakita is making his way over to D'Agosta.  The crush at the entrance is incredible. \nKAWAKITA Lieutenant!  It's me. \nD'AGOSTA What is it? \nKAWAKITA Dr. Green has to see you! \nD'AGOSTA Got my hands full here. \nKAWAKITA It's important.  Please.  You have to come!  Pendergast, too.  She's found out something. \nD'Agosta pulls out his walkie talkie. \nD'AGOSTA McNitt?  D'Agosta here. \nINT. SECURITY COMMAND CENTER - MUSEUM - NIGHT \nOfficer McNitt stands in the corner of the computer room, bathed in neon light.  Running the security system is GEORGE, your basic computer nerd.  Multiple screens all over show various rooms in the museum.  Most are empty with the exception of those showing the exhibition.  On these, the crowds can be seen entering the various rooms.  McNitt holds his walkie talkie. \nMCNITT Yeah Lieutenant?  I'm here. \nD'AGOSTA (ON RADIO) I'm heading to the Evolutionary Bio labs.  Any sign of Pendergast? \nMCNITT Not yet. \nAt this moment a NOISE comes from the adjoining room.  McNitt's head SWIVELS.  It's a LOUD THUMP. \nMCNITT Hold on Lieutenant. (to George) What was that? \nGEORGE Probably just something wrong with the air conditioning.  There's a shit load of electrical rooms back there. \nGeorge is playing an elaborate computer game and not paying attention. McNitt returns to his walkie talkie as the THUMP comes again.  Now he looks distinctly nervous. \nMCNITT Lieutenant?  There's something wrong in the computer room. \nD'AGOSTA (ON RADIO) Goddamn it.  I'll get Ippolito and send him up. \nGeorge rises. \nGEORGE You're over-reacting.  Sounds like the air conditioning to me. \nMcNitt watches uneasily as George opens the door, disappears into the next room. \nINT. ENTRANCE - SUPERSTITION EXIBIT - NIGHT \nD'Agosta turns to Kawakita who waits, shifting from foot to foot. \nD'AGOSTA Damn.  There's some kind of problem in the computer room.  I have to go get Ippolito.  You wait here. \nD'Agosta heads into the exhibit before Kawakita can protest. \nINT. SUPERSTITION EXHIBIT - NIGHT \nWe see various cuts of people as they move into the different rooms.  A TEENAGE GIRL (LAUREN) and her FATHER (DAVID) examine a lidless, rotting European style coffin, complete with corpse.  A white haired gentleman (DR. POUND), leans on his cane as he looks at a display on primitive medicine practiced with implements that look like torture tools. \nCuthbert and Ippolito are at the head of a press of people, giving the MAYOR and HIS WIFE a guided tour. \nCUTHBERT Here we have a very rare sacrificial table from Mesoamerica.  The priests would kill the victim on this slab, cut out the heart and eat it while it was still beating. \nMAYOR I could use one of these things in City Hall. \nCuthbert laughs right on cue.  They pass a Congo power figure with its bulging eye sockets and torso riddled with sharp nails.  Several people recoil from it, looking repulsed.  The MAYOR's WIFE sees it and looks distressed. \nMAYOR'S WIFE You're letting kids see this?  I should think they'd have nightmares. \nKAWAKITA What happened?! \nD'AGOSTA There's a dead body in the exhibit! People are panicking, trampling each other trying to get out. \nIppolito runs over to join them. \nD'AGOSTA What the hell is going on?! \nAbove them THE LIGHTS dim again and come back on. \nIPPOLITO The whole system is shutting down! We have to get out quickly before the fire doors fall! \nD'AGOSTA What doors? \nIPPOLITO I told you!  They seal off all the cells.  They were designed to fall automatically in a system failure -- \nD'AGOSTA You said the system couldn't fail! \nAt this there's a low rumble from above.  D'Agosta looks up and sees A LARGE METAL DOOR IS DESCENDING from a slot in the ceiling, and not in an orderly fashion.  It's falling fast.  Below are crowds of people, all pushing to get out!  Officer Bailey, near the door, sees it. \nBAILEY Above you!  Look out! \nHis voice is lost in an ocean of screaming.  Kawakita stands in total horror a moment, then joins Bailey and D'Agosta. \nAll of them try to restrain people from trying to beat the door. Ippolito, on the other hand, elbows his way to the front of the fleeing crowd! \nD'AGOSTA Ippolito!  Get back here! \nIPPOLITO Like hell! \nIgnoring D'Agosta, Ippolito pushes past.  He barrels over an OLD MAN who stumbles and falls DIRECTLY BENEATH THE FALLING DOOR!  Ippolito jumps over him and is out! \nThe old man looks up at the descending wall of steel and SCREAMS! D'AGOSTA runs forward, dives for the old man but he's not in time. \nKawakita covers his eyes, unable to watch as the lights flicker a third and last time.  The room is plunged into darkness.  And over the screams we hear the rumble and CRASH, the horrifying cries of the old man, as the door comes down. \nINT. MARGO'S LAB - NIGHT \nMargo and Frock stand in the darkness.  Through a high window we can see lightning flash. \nMARGO What's going on? \nFROCK Some kind of power failure.  Maybe it's the storm.  Do you have a flashlight? \nMARGO I think so. \nShe gets one from a cupboard. \nFROCK Greg's been gone over a half hour. We'd better get out of here.  Get the crate. \nINT. HALLWAYS - NIGHT \nFrock wheels his chair as fast as he can.  Margo runs beside him carrying the crate with the fibers inside.  A peel of thunder ends and distant screaming is heard.  Margo stops, appalled. \nMARGO Dr. Frock.  Did you hear that? \nFROCK Don't stop now. \nUp ahead they hear METALLIC RUMBLING and a CRASH!  They round a corner and come up against a huge STEEL DOOR. \nMARGO What's that? \nFROCK It's one of the fire doors.  Good Lord, Margo.  We're trapped! \nINT. BASEMENT - NIGHT \nPendergast stands at the end of a cul de sac, studying the blue prints by a stone wall.  Jonathan and the dog are with him, exhausted and terrified.  Jonathan keeps an eye on the corridor behind them as Pendergast works. \nPENDERGAST I know where we are now.  We're getting out, Jonathan.  This should be another door. \nTaking a pen knife from his pocket, Pendergast places it into the plaster and gently twists the blade.  A piece of plaster the size of a dinner plate falls, revealing the tracings of another doorway. Pendergast shoves the door open to reveal a dark, dusty room. \nJONATHAN Hallelujah, Pendergast.  Where the hell are we now? \nINT. \"ALCOHOLIC\" ROOM - NIGHT \nJonathan and Pendergast enter quickly from the hidden rear door. Pendergast shines his beam on dusty shelves filled with specimens.  All are stored in jars of alcohol.  There are fetuses of many different species.  We see a pig, a cow, a duck billed platypus as well as brain sections, a disembodied monkey head.  One rectangular glass container holds a skinned human foot. \nAs the flashlight beam hits it, MBWUN roars and looks up.  Now we see it clearly for the first time.  The monster is MASSIVE, putrid, rank. Slit reptilian green eyes are rimmed in red.  A ridge of stiff black hair rises on the creature's buffalo-like humped back.  The withers are muscled and covered with plates.  A forked TONGUE licks out as purple lips draw back exposing razor sharp teeth.  The claws raise up to fend off the light. \nPENDERGAST steadies himself with difficulty, takes a few seconds to aim with the greatest care.  Mbwun makes a move towards him and he squeezes the trigger hard.  The gun echoes in the hall.  A split second and a white streak moves right up the beast's cranium.  A direct hit. The shot echoes and Mbwun drops it's claws. \nThe flashlight continues to shine like a high beam right into the beast's eyes.  Angry and blinded, the creature turns and in a moment, lopes off.  Pendergast watches, unimaginably relieved.  Realizing what just happened, his knees start to buckle.  He catches himself, wipes one hand across his eyes.  A voice comes from the storage room. \nMARGO (OS) Pendergast?  Are you all right? \nPENDERGAST No.  I think I'm hallucinating. \nThe storage door opens slowly and Margo looks out. \nMARGO You're not.  Where is it? \nPENDERGAST (shakes his head) Gone. \nMARGO Wounded? \nPENDERGAST No.  A chromium alloy tipped .45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing's skull like a spit ball.  I think it was bothered by my light. \nMARGO That would fit.  It's nocturnal. Quick.  Come inside. \nEXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT \nAs hundreds of the guests emerge into the pounding rain... crying, terrified, unclear what exactly happened.  These are the lucky ones. Among them we find IPPOLITO.  His walkie talkie is squawking.  The windows of the museum behind him are black. \nD'AGOSTA ON RADIO Ippolito!  Where the hell are you? We're trapped in here!  We need help! Ippolito!  Come in, dammit! \nIppolito sits down on the steps in the rain, knowing the extent of what he's done.  The wheels are working hard now, trying to figure out damage control.  The walkie talkie keeps calling.  He doesn't respond. \nINT. HALL OF THE HEAVENS - NIGHT \nTables are overturned, food lies on the ground, people cower in the darkness.  D'Agosta crouches in some broken glass with his walkie talkie.  He shuts it off, rises, looks around.  Light comes from a few sputtering candles. \nMost of the guests still trapped inside are grouped around the lowered steel door.  Among them are KAWAKITA and CUTHBERT.  From the BODY of the man crushed underneath the door extends a large puddle of blood. Bailey is working in desperation on a brass panel by the door. \nBAILEY Manual overrides aren't working.  I'm getting nothing, Lieutenant. \nD'AGOSTA Great. \nFrank, the father of the teenage girl, Lauren, steps forward. \nFRANK There's no power.  The whole system's down. \nThe crowd starts to murmur.  One man yells. \nMAN We're trapped!  And there's a killer in here! \nD'AGOSTA We'll get out safely if everyone stays calm.  Is anyone else hurt? \nThe MAYOR stands.  His wife's forehead is bleeding. \nMAYOR Yes.  My wife. \nD'AGOSTA Is there a doctor? \nThe distinguished grey haired man with a cane comes forward.  DR. POUND. \nPOUND I'm Dr. Pound. \nD'AGOSTA Check this woman and see if anyone else needs you. \nPound moves off.  Everyone spins now at the incongruous sound of a DOG BARK.  D'Agosta pulls his gun.  The door to a stairwell at the far end of the room opens and Hobbes bounds into the hall!  He's followed by Jonathan, who is filthy and wild-eyed. \nJONATHAN (calls) Lieutenant D'Agosta!  Don't shoot. \nD'AGOSTA Where's Pendergast? \nJONATHAN (crossing, breathless) Five flights down.  We were lost in the sub-basement.  Something's down there.  It killed our two deputies. When I left Pendergast it was coming back.  He sent me for help.  We have to hurry. \nD'Agosta makes a quick sweep of the room with his flashlight.  The remote corners of the hall are so black the light seems to disappear. In the center, two men are bending over a still form.  One of them is Dr. Pound. \nD'AGOSTA Both of you.  Get back here. \nPOUND But he's still alive -- \nD'AGOSTA Get back now! \nD'Agosta throws open the doors and charges into the Hall.  Jonathan lies on the ground, dazed.  Kawakita stands to one side, teeth chattering in shock.  His hand shakes so badly that the barrel of the gun swings in his hand. \nD'AGOSTA (yells) Where is it?! \nJONATHAN I don't know!  It hit me hard. \nD'Agosta pumps two shells in the shotgun.  Screams can be heard from the people crouched together at the edge of the room.  Hobbes is barking wildly, foaming at the mouth.  It's too dark to see what's happening. \nD'AGOSTA (screams) Somebody tell me!  Where is it now? \nMAYOR (quiet) Lieutenant.  In the south corner. \nD'Agosta sweeps his light to the Mayor who stands rigid in front of the others, points to his left.  The light moves to the far end of the room where THE DARK SHAPE OF MBWUN crouches over the body of a man. It's lunging up and down with odd, jerking motions.  The man is long past making a sound.  From the monster comes a faint crunching and slobbering.  Jonathan rises, comes to D'Agosta.  So does Frank.  They stand shoulder to shoulder, raise their guns.  D'Agosta motions for Kawakita. \nD'AGOSTA On three. \nKawakita stumbles to join them, tries to join in.  The barrel of his shot gun still swings wildly.  He steadies it by taking it in both hands. \nD'AGOSTA One, two... three. \nAll three fire.  There's a loud report.  The kickback knocks Kawakita backwards.  Screams erupt from the huddled group.  Hobbes abruptly shuts up.  The men fire and fire until there's nothing left.  D'Agosta reaches for more shells, comes up empty. \nD'AGOSTA Jonathan!  Get everyone behind me! \nJonathan moves.  D'Agosta sweeps his light across the room but already the shape is gone.  Cuthbert hides behind the Mayor, calls out in a terrified squeal. \nCUTHBERT It went out the door to the rotunda! \nD'Agosta runs across the room to a set of double industrial doors. There's a noise in the darkness beyond and he just manages to slam both doors.  He picks up a metal chair and jams it through the handles. Backs up.  The doors shudder as something hits them hard. \nD'AGOSTA Get everyone into the stairwell! \nJonathan, the Mayor, Cuthbert and Kawakita together herd everyone towards the stairwell.  They move inside. \nINT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT \nDark and close.  The smell of gunpowder and death.  The Mayor's Wife sees Bailey's body and clutches her mouth so as not to throw up. \nCUTHBERT Sweet Jesus! \nD'AGOSTA Get his gun and his walkie talkie, Jonathan.  Move. \nCUTHBERT My office is on the third floor! There's a walk-in safe and a portable phone!  We can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help! \nD'AGOSTA I have to help Pendergast.  Kawakita and Jonathan stay with me.  The rest of you can go with Cuthbert! \nMAYOR I think we should stick together! \nFRANK (taking Bailey's shotgun) Me too. \nCUTHBERT I'm leaving.  Whoever wants can come with me. \nNo one follows. \nD'AGOSTA Wait! \nCuthbert's gone. \nD'AGOSTA Jonathan, go with him!  He isn't armed. \nJonathan grabs Hobbes' leash from the Mayor and bounds up the stairs. \nMAYOR Good luck! \nEveryone else follows D'Agosta.  Together, they head down. \nEXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT \nPolice cars are pulling up outside the museum.  Sirens wail.  Torrents of rain limit the number of onlookers.  Crowds of people are scattered about.  There's disbelief on everyone's faces.  Many people are in shock.  Ippolito sprints through the pelting rain to a GUARD STATION near the gate.  He yanks the door open and jumps inside. \nINT. GUARD STATION - NIGHT \nA number of museum security personnel are milling in confusion. \nIPPOLITO All right everyone.  I'm in charge. Status report. \nOne of the security men, WATERS, rises. \nFROCK We can't.  We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe.  I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements.  If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do.  The building must be swarming with police by now.  It won't take long for them to get through the doors. \nMARGO That thing could kill ten people in a matter of minutes. \nPENDERGAST But what can we do?  Our guns are useless -- \nMARGO We have the fibers.  Don't you see? The creature is hungry.  It wants the hormones in these plants.  It would take hundreds of human brains to supply what's in these fibers.  We're just a poor substitute.  To make it stop hunting, we have to give it what it wants. \nINT. CUTHBERT'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nCuthbert enters with Jonathan and the dog, Hobbes.  Cuthbert locks the door with shaking hands.  He mutters to himself in terror. \nCUTHBERT Solid oak.  Two inches thick.  Tell me they'll hold. \nCuthbert scurries to his desk and pulls out a Ruger .38 Magnum. \nCUTHBERT I got it after I was mugged in the subway last spring. \nJONATHAN Where's the walk-in safe? \nCUTHBERT Behind you. \nJONATHAN What's the combination? \nCUTHBERT I'll do it.  Just let me find my portable phone. \nHe rummages in the darkness, going through his desk. \nJONATHAN Forget it! \nCUTHBERT Calm down.  I found it! \nCuthbert flips the phone open and turns it on. \nCUTHBERT Battery's dead.  Shit. \nJONATHAN Let's go! \nCuthbert crosses to a huge wall safe, starts frantically turning the tumblers.  Jonathan follows with the dog. \nCUTHBERT That thing won't come after us, right?  It's going for bigger game. The group blundering around in the basement.  Poor fools. \nJONATHAN Hurry up! \nCUTHBERT Just a minute.  I'm shaking!  Take the gun. \nCuthbert fumbles to hand over the Ruger.  As he does, something drops. \nCUTHBERT Oh God!  I dropped my rabbit's foot! \nCuthbert drops to his knees, groping in the darkness. \nJONATHAN For Chrissake, I'll do it.  What's the combination?! \nCUTHBERT To the left twice then five no... sorry... I think it's fifteen... it's been a while... \nJONATHAN Oh Jesus... \nJonathan starts again, sweating.  The tumblers fall with agonizing slowness.  Cuthbert continues groping frantically for his good luck charm.  Meanwhile, unnoticed by Jonathan, the dog is staring at the oak doors.  We see the HAIR ON HIS BACK rise! \nJONATHAN Fifteen... what's next? \nCUTHBERT Eight to the right!  Look!  I found it! \nClutching the rabbit's foot like a talisman, Cuthbert leaps up just as the last tumbler falls. \nAt this the oak doors behind them CRASH OPEN, splintering like so many match sticks. \nCuthbert SCREAMS in a high pitch whine at the sight of the beast.  The dog barks wildly at Mbwun!  Jonathan lifts his shot gun.  But the monster barrels past him and zeros in on Cuthbert! \nA HUGE RED TONGUE LICKS OUT and encircles Cuthbert's waist!  It squeezes him horribly, drags him towards the open jaws!  Cuthbert bellows like a lamb being led to the slaughter.  He opens his hand and the rabbit's foot drops!  The last Jonathan sees of Cuthbert is his head disappearing down Mbwun's throat. \nHobbes barks and whines in terror.  Jonathan takes the leash and drags the animal out. \nINT. MUSEUM HALLWAYS - NIGHT \nJonathan and Hobbes tear down the hallway and disappear.  Behind them comes a roar so loud it rattles the walls. \nD'AGOSTA Step back! \nD'Agosta, Frank and Kawakita aim their guns at the door and shoot repeatedly.  The shots echo wildly.  The sound is terrifyingly loud.  The small glass window shatters.  Then the men lean heavily on the door.  It still won't budge.  D'Agosta looks through the window. \nD'AGOSTA It's no use.  We have to get out of here! (to Kawakita) Give them your walkie talkie. \nKawakita hands his walkie talkie through the window.  Margo takes it. \nKAWAKITA Is Dr. Frock safe! \nMARGO Yes, he's fine.  Greg... take care of yourself! \nINT. HALL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MAMMALS - NIGHT \nPendergast looks desperately at the blueprints. \nMARGO Is there another way around? \nPENDERGAST No.  The planetarium is in the next cell.  This is one of the fire doors... \nPendergast returns to the window. \nPENDERGAST Vince?  There's no way we can get to you with the fire doors down. There's an entrance to the sub- basement in the hall off the north side exit. \nD'AGOSTA The sub-basement? \nPENDERGAST I've been down there.  It links up to the old sewer system.  I can guide you out. \nD'Agosta turns to the others. \nD'AGOSTA How much ammo do we have to make a stand? \nKAWAKITA You're asking me?  I don't even know how to load this thing. \nFRANK Four rounds... \nThere's a movement of air... and a ripe, fetid smell. \nD'AGOSTA Oh shit. \nD'Agosta pumps his shot gun. \nD'AGOSTA I smell it.  It's here. \nPENDERGAST Go out the north exit!  There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases.  Run! \nD'AGOSTA Everybody.  Get behind me. \nThe others move past.  D'Agosta, Frank and Greg Kawakita hold the rear. The group runs to the side exit to the planetarium and in a moment, disappears. \nINT. HALL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MAMMALS - NIGHT \nPendergast remains at the window watching anxiously.  From the south entrance to the planetarium, an ENORMOUS DARK SHAPE slinks into view! Pendergast steps back from the doorway, turns to Margo. \nPENDERGAST Hide quickly! \nMARGO What are you going to do? \nPendergast checks his gun, totally calm. \nPENDERGAST Buy them some time. \nMargo turns and looks around at the looming dioramas.  There's a plain door at their end of the hall.  Pendergast faces the broken window. \nHIS POV... the beast is slinking away after D'Agosta and the others, headed to the north exit from the Planetarium! \nPENDERGAST calls out... \nPENDERGAST Hey you big tub of lard!  Over here! \nTHE BEAST PAUSES, turns. \nPendergast puts his palms up at his ears, wiggles his fingers and makes a face through the window. \nPENDERGAST Come on, you smelly pile of refuse. Come get me.  I dare you! \nA LOW surprised GROWL comes from the beast.  It crouches as if to pounce.  Pendergast makes more faces, sticks his tongue out.  The beast watches in silence, its evil eyes fixed. \nON D'AGOSTA... he reaches the second fork and takes a right.  This tunnel is narrower and consequently the water is even deeper.  Slimy plants hang down and slap at their faces as they push on.  D'Agosta pulls out his walkie talkie. \nD'AGOSTA Pendergast?  I made the right hand fork.  We're already in about three feet of water.  Where should we go? \nBut before Pendergast can answer, D'Agosta hears the loud report of Frank's gun!  Everyone freezes in the darkness.  The walkie talkie cackles and D'Agosta shouts! \nD'AGOSTA Hello! \nFRANK (OS) Sweet Jesus, help! \nThey hear SPLASHING in the water.  Lauren SCREAMS, tries to run back. Kawakita grabs her.  There's more thrashing water and then silence. \nD'AGOSTA Frank!  Are you all right! \nD'Agosta starts for Frank but the Mayor catches his arm and holds him. \nMAYOR It's too late! \nEveryone waits, staring into the darkness.  Still no answer.  Lauren SCREAMS AGAIN. \nLAUREN Dad! \nD'Agosta turns his flashlight on the water.  It's running red!  He spins to the Mayor, points down the tunnel. \nD'AGOSTA Run! \nPeople start to cry and whimper as the Mayor urges them on.  He takes charge of Lauren.  Only Greg Kawakita stays with D'Agosta.  They stand shoulder to shoulder and completely alone.  Thrashing in the water can be heard as the beast comes closer.  There's a low, pleasurable growl! Both men lift their guns. \nD'AGOSTA On three. \nKawakita nods.  Behind them in the tunnel is total blackness.  Ahead is equally dark.  The noise of their friends gets ever fainter.  The water now rushes half way up their thighs.  Kawakita's teeth start to chatter.  He bites them shut, steadies his gun. \nD'AGOSTA One... two... \nSilence as the water murmurs.  D'Agosta holds the count.  A long, agonizing moment.  Kawakita takes his eyes away from the tunnel. \nKAWAKITA I think it's gone. \nSuddenly a HUGE CLAW snakes out of the water right in front of them and the beast roars up!  It was beneath the surface, directly before them!  The claw closes on D'Agosta and his shot gun goes off.  D'Agosta screams as the beast lifts him towards its mouth! \nFor one horrible moment, Kawakita is frozen.  Then he leaps forward, shoves the barrel of his gun behind D'Agosta, right in the beast's open jaws!  He pulls the trigger and the shotgun explodes, the recoil throwing him back, ass over tea cups in the water.  With a roar of pain the monster drops D'Agosta and retreats in the dark.  D'Agosta grabs Kawakita. \nD'AGOSTA I think you took its tonsils out! \nThey haul ass down the tunnel, firing behind them as they go.  Ahead is another fork.  The group is waiting.  When they see D'Agosta and Kawakita, a cheer goes up. \nMAYOR Which way! \nAs he runs up, D'Agosta grabs for his walkie talkie.  The holster IS EMPTY, the walkie talkie gone!  Without missing a beat he registers what's happened, then covers it up with the next breath.  He points to the right as if there's no doubt and says... \nD'AGOSTA This way! \nD'Agosta exchanges a look with Kawakita, who understands exactly what happened.  As they plunge into the right tunnel, Greg mutters... \nKAWAKITA Holy shit. \nINT. HALL OF THE AFRICAN MAMMALS - NIGHT \nPendergast and Margo come out of the door leading to the back entry to the dioramas.  Pendergast holds the walkie talkie, desperate. \nPENDERGAST Vince?  Can you hear me?  Vince! \nNothing but static comes in response.  Margo paces in agitation. \nMARGO We have to try and draw it off! \nPENDERGAST How? \nMARGO The answer's right in front of us. \nShe points to one of the dioramas.  It shows a bird being stalked by a fox. \nMARGO That's a ptarmigan, feigning a broken wing.  The bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest! \nPENDERGAST (starts running) It's deceptively simple.  Like a Bruckner Symphony or a Matisse. \nMargo heads for the Planetarium, calling... \nWATERS We can't raise the S.W.A.T. team.  No one's answering!  What do you want to do? \nIppolito eyes are fixed on the room below them. \nIPPOLITO Holy shit.  Pull him up. \nLightning throws horrible shadows of the hulking dinosaur skeletons all around as MBWUN LIMPS INTO THE HALL!  The men on the roof stare down astonished.  Their mouths hang open at the sight! \nIPPOLITO Get more guns!  Now! \nThe men get the drunk up and abandon the sling, leaving Jonathan trapped below. \nINT. HALL OF THE DINOSAURS - NIGHT \nJonathan and Hobbes take cover behind one of the dinosaurs and hide. Mbwun sees Jonathan, lifts both claws, SWINGS at the skeleton, sending it crashing down!  Jonathan SCREAMS, Hobbes is caught and falls.  He scrambles into a corner, whimpering, as Pendergast and Margo appear in the door.  Fifteen more S.W.A.T. team members with rifles now line the hole in the roof.  They all point their guns at Mbwun. \nIPPOLITO Get back!  We're going to shoot! \nNow Margo runs forward. \nMARGO No.  Wait!  Let me talk to him first! \nIPPOLITO (screaming) Kill that thing!  Kill it now! \nMARGO No! \nMBWUN... turns and sees Margo.  She speaks desperately. \nMARGO John... you can give up now!  Just lie down where you are! \nMbwun seems to consider for a moment, but then its eyes gleam and it ROARS.  With renewed vigor it leaps to the wall and starts to WALK UP IT like a GECKO, ON ALL FOURS!  ON THE ROOF... \nSome of the S.W.A.T. team fall back in terror!  Now that the monster is on the wall it's out of range of their fire! \nWATERS Holy shit it's coming this way! \nIPPOLITO It's headed for the roof.  Run! \nIppolito turns and takes off once more in sheer terror.  Astonished, Waters tries to regain control. \nWATERS Get back here, you asshole!  We can't let it get out! (to the S.W.A.T. team) Surround the opening and kill it! \nBut the men are terrified, retreating like Ippolito.  Waters shouts. \nWATERS Back, everybody!  That's an order! \nBut the team is in chaos and losing precious time. \nINT. HALL OF THE DINOSAURS - NIGHT \nThe MONSTER is now half way up the wall.  Margo is distraught, crying. Her cool demeanor is cracked.  Pendergast is with her.  She shakes her head. \nMARGO Just like John.  He won't listen. \nPENDERGAST I have to shoot. \nMARGO Do it, quickly.  Please.  Aim for the eye. \nPendergast raises a HIGH POWERED RIFLE with a laser sight.  He aims the red laser beam directly at Mbwun's left eye. \nPENDERGAST He has to look here or I won't get a clear shot.  Call him, Margo. \nMARGO I can't! \nPENDERGAST You have to.  Do it now! \nMargo takes a moment, her eyes streaming.  She has no choice, she calls out. \nMARGO John!  John, look at me! \nThe beast looks down, sees Pendergast's rifle.  There's a long, awful, moment.  Suddenly it emits a sound like a wail. \nON JONATHAN... staring, stunned. \nPENDERGAST... steady... \nMARGO... She's crying as she raises her arm as if to say good-bye. \n", "test1_input": "MARGO Warrior deity of the Kothoga, an extinct South American tribe.  Dr. John Whittlesley led an expedition that found the only known representation of Mbwun.  The statue is said to carry a curse. (she looks away, quiet) Every member of Whittlesley's expedition died. \nCUTHBERT I got the relic out yesterday to put on display.  Beauregard was there. The crates had been broken into and the contents were strewn about.  But nothing was missing.  It was downright weird.  We joked that it was the curse of Mbwun.  I'm not laughing now. \nFROCK Come, Ian.  We all know you're superstitious.  But you're among scientists here.  We deal in facts. That statue had nothing to do with what happened to Beauregard. \nCUTHBERT All I know is, everyone who has come in contact with that relic, is dead. \nINT. BUSINESS OFFICES - MUSEUM - DAY \nD'Agosta has set up a temporary command post among the antique desks and chairs.  The room is on the ground floor with a view of the park. Gawkers are outside looking in.  D'Agosta pulls the blinds in their faces. \nD'AGOSTA (mutters) Get a life. \nPendergast is looking closely at one of the large paintings of birds that line the walls. \nPENDERGAST An original Roger Tory Peterson of a Red-Breasted Merganser.  Amazing.  I have a copy of this in my office at home. \nD'AGOSTA Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast.  I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down. \nPENDERGAST In this violent world, I believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things. \nD'AGOSTA I drink.  After hours of course.  On duty, I smoke. (he pulls out a fat cigar) Do you mind? \nPENDERGAST Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar. \nD'AGOSTA Then you won't like this one.  It's a piece of shit. \nHe bites off the end, spits it out on the floor. \nPENDERGAST Lieutenant -- \nD'AGOSTA Call me Vince. \nPENDERGAST Did you read about a boat that washed up outside of New Orleans about four months ago?  Twelve bodies on board. \nD'AGOSTA Who didn't?  Big news.  Out of Brazil, wasn't it? \nPENDERGAST Yes.  That's my case.  Now it's yours. All the corpses were badly mutilated in a very particular way. Decapitated.  Brains extracted.  Limbs torn to shreds.  It looked like the work of a large animal, but there was no sign of an animal on board. \nD'AGOSTA So the method of death is the only connection? \nPENDERGAST No.  There's more.  There were crates from this museum in the hold of the boat. \nBAILEY enters, interrupts. \nBAILEY Uh, Vince.  Sorry.  This won't wait. \nD'AGOSTA It better be good. \nBAILEY There are a couple of kids who were lost yesterday near the site of the murder.  Claimed they saw a monster. They're pretty determined to tell you their story.  You want to see them? \nD'AGOSTA (rolls his eyes) No. \nPENDERGAST If you don't mind, this could be important. \nD'AGOSTA You're kidding. \nPENDERGAST Unfortunately, no. \nINT. MUSEUM CLASSROOM - DAY \nA modern classroom that has been taken over by the police for the purpose of interrogation.  Seated on small chairs at a plain table are... \nHENRY and LARRY, looking like two little boys with a story they are desperate to share.  Standing behind them is MRS. BEASLEY, starchier than ever.  D'Agosta takes a chair across from the boys, at their eye level.  By this time of day he looks pretty rumpled and tired. Pendergast stands upright and unruffled in a doorway behind.  This isn't hard duty for D'Agosta.  He's surprisingly genial and at ease with kids.  Larry kicks his sneaker against the table leg in excitement.  Henry tugs his t-shirt. \nD'AGOSTA Hi.  I'm Lieutenant D'Agosta.  You can call me Vince.  This is Special Agent Pendergast.  You can call him... (he looks to Pendergast, so formal) Special Agent Pendergast. \nBEASLEY This is Henry Weiss and Larry Bowers. \nD'AGOSTA So... Tell us about this monster. \nLARRY We were lost and trying to find a short cut to the dino-- \nHenry elbows him hard.  Larry shuts up. \nHENRY We were just lost, okay?  And we went down this curvy staircase.  At the bottom was a big shadow. \n", "test1_true": "HENRY Not that big. \nLARRY Well almost.  Depends which house.  It smelled like old hamburger, and it made this weird noise. \nHenry makes a low GROWL in his throat.  D'Agosta suppresses a smile, shoots Pendergast a look.  But Pendergast watches the kids intently. \nLARRY And it snuffled the ground like a dog. \nHENRY Like this. \nHe goes on hands and knees, sniffs the ground. \nLARRY It had a long tongue, teeth this big and yellow eyes. \nHENRY They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's. \nLARRY They were yellow! \nHENRY You're color blind. \nBEASLEY Boys, please! (to D'Agosta) These two get in a lot of mischief and they tell some amazing whoppers. \nD'AGOSTA I can see that. \nHENRY This isn't a whopper!  It's the truth. \nPendergast now moves forward, pulls up a chair as if deeply interested. \nPENDERGAST How did you get away? \nHENRY We ran and screamed and stuff.  And we got through a little door just in time.  There was a guard there and he went back to check. \nPENDERGAST A guard?  Do you remember his name? \nLARRY He was wearing one of those I.D. badges.  His name was Bo... something. \nD'AGOSTA Beauregard? \nLARRY Yeah. \nEXT. MUSEUM - DAY \nAn ambulance pulls away, lights flashing.  Pendergast and D'Agosta walk to a squad car. \nD'AGOSTA I've got to admit, that was a damn sight better than \"the dog ate my homework\". \nPENDERGAST How do you explain the part about Beauregard? \nD'AGOSTA They heard the victim's name and wove him into their story.  Nice touch. \nPENDERGAST I believed them. \nD'Agosta stops, stunned. \nD'AGOSTA You think what we've got here is a monster as big as a house that smells... like hamburger? \nPENDERGAST No.  I think what we've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon... who wants us to believe he's a monster. \nD'AGOSTA (totally confused) Oh. \nINT. NEW YORK CITY MORGUE - EVENING \nD'Agosta and Pendergast thread their way down a hall lined with bodies on gurneys.  It's dark and quiet.  They go into the autopsy room. \nINT. AUTOPSY ROOM - AFTERNOON \nA large gurney, currently empty, sits like an uninvited guest under the bright lights of the autopsy suite.  Beside it is a tall, imposing doctor in her late 50's, with intense eyes.  This is DR. ZIEWZIC.  With her are the PHOTOGRAPHER seen passing out at the museum, and a young intern, DOCTOR GROSS. \nDR. ZIEWZIC You're late, Vince. \nD'AGOSTA Sorry Dr. Ziewzic.  This is Special Agent Pendergast.  Pendergast, Dr. Ziewzic.  She runs the best chop shop in New York. \nPENDERGAST We've met.  The Hacksaw Murders.  '89. \nDR. ZIEWZIC Oh yes!  Who could forget.  Afterwards you sent me that amazing case of Chateau Lafitte. \nPENDERGAST I hope you liked it. \n", "test2_input": "DR. ZIEWZIC Lovely bouquet.  After our last case, Vince took me out for a draft beer. As I recall we split the check. \nD'AGOSTA (grumbles) It's been one of those days. \nDR. ZIEWZIC (she snaps her rubber glove) Shall we get down to it, then? \nDr. Gross wheels the gurney over to the morgue bank and slides open a drawer.  The shape under the plastic seems too small to be human.  To the side of it is a large bump, presumably the head.  The two pieces of cadaver are slid onto the gurney and wheeled under the lights.  A stainless steel bucket is placed under the gurney's outlet pipe.  Dr. Ziewzic fiddles with a microphone hanging above the body, she taps it and it gives off the proper static. \nDR. ZIEWZIC (for the microphone) This is Dr. Matilda Ziewzic, assisted by Dr. Frederick Gross. It's Oct. 28, six fifteen p.m.  We are joined by Lieutenant Vincent D'Agosta of the NYPD, Special Agent Pendergast of the FBI and a police photographer.  Let's see what we've got. \nThey pull off the sheet and D'AGOSTA swallows hard, closes his eyes to keep his stomach in check.  The photographer goes green, but is determined not to clutch this time.  PENDERGAST leans closer, totally impassive.  He puts on a small pair of wire rim glasses, assumes an expression much like a man reading a menu in a restaurant. \nDR. ZIEWZIC Caucasian male.  Age about 27.  Blond. Height well I can't give a height because Mr. Beauregard has been decapitated.  The state of the body is such that other identifying marks are out of the question.  There are numerous lacerations proceeding from the left anterior pectoral downwards through the sternum and terminating in the abdomen.  This is a massive wound, two feet long and a foot wide.  The head has suffered severe trauma and the occipital portion of the calavarium has been crushed and removed.  It almost looks like... \nDR. GROSS (beat) A bite. \nZiewzic turns to Pendergast. \nDR. ZIEWZIC What are we talking about here? \nPENDERGAST Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa. \nDR. ZIEWZIC Right. (back to work) The entire brain appears to have been extracted.  May I see it, please? \nGross passes over a grey, watery mass that sits in a stainless steel pan.  Ziewzic studies Beauregard's brain, or what's left of it... \nDR. ZIEWZIC Curious.  There's something missing. \nPENDERGAST The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps? \nDR. ZIEWZIC (looks up, surprised) Yes.  Two organs the size of a walnut have been removed with what looks like surgical precision. \nD'AGOSTA What happened to them? \nPENDERGAST If you don't mind a suggestion, you might try a saliva test. \nZiewzic, Gross and D'Agosta look at Pendergast.  The photographer is staring at the wall, silently mouthing multiplication tables to keep from woofing all over the place. \nD'AGOSTA (incredulous) Saliva test?  You mean, you think someone ate part of the brain? \nPENDERGAST Correct. \nA long moment of silence, then... Zwiezic uses a swab for the saliva test, puts the result in a petrie dish. \nDR. ZWIEZIC Okay.  One saliva test.  Now... let's look at these lacerations.  They start wide and then converge. \nD'AGOSTA Long fingernails?  Scratches? \nDR. ZWIEZIC Too extreme.  Perhaps some kind of weapon.  I'm now probing the wound and... there's a piece of foreign material deep in the muscle, lodged on a rib.  Photograph. \nThe photographer gathers his courage, steps forward with D'Agosta and Pendergast.  Zwiezic rinses the object off in a beaker of sterile water.  It turns brownish red.  She holds it up.  They all stare in astonished silence.  D'Agosta swallows. \nD'AGOSTA Sweet Jesus. \nDR. ZWIEZIC It's a claw. \nThe photographer's flash goes off. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. STREETS - NIGHT \nA black and white heads uptown. \nINT. COP CAR - NIGHT \nPendergast sits in silence.  D'Agosta is visibly disturbed. \nD'AGOSTA I don't like animals.  Never have. Dog bit me when I was little.  After that I gave up on pets.  Animals are irrational.  Give me a psychotic killer any day.  If there's one thing that makes me queasy it's being part of a food chain.  My first case as a rookie, two brothers climbed a fence at the zoo.  It was late August.  Over ninety.  The polar bear was inside his cave.  Kids didn't know he was in there.  All they saw was the pool. They got to swimming and splashing. The noise woke up the bear.  By the time I arrived, both little boys were in pieces.  The bear was dragging one kid around by the foot. I can still hear the mother screaming -- \nPENDERGAST This isn't an animal, Vince.  I've been on this case four months, remember?  I've learned a few things. \nD'AGOSTA You've been holding out on me Pendergast.  You have a suspect capable of this? \nPendergast looks over, nods quietly. \nPENDERGAST Let me tell you about it, Vince. \n", "test2_true": "The yellow crime scene tape is torn and flapping in a light rain.  Most of the emergency vehicles have left.  The police have released the employees who are now headed home.  We see Frock and Kawakita exit. Cuthbert isn't far behind.  Pendergast approaches them, headed back inside. \nPENDERGAST Excuse me.  Has Dr. Green left? \nKAWAKITA Before eight?  You must be joking. She's in the physical anthro lab making up for lost time. \nPendergast nods his thanks. \nINT. MUSEUM HALL OF THE GEMS - NIGHT \nThe gems glow in the darkness as Pendergast passes through the now empty room. \nINT. METEORITE ROOM - NIGHT \nPendergast's footfalls are lost in the carpet as he goes down the far stairs. \nINT. HALLWAY - MUSEUM - NIGHT \nPendergast goes down a long, dark hall alone.  He arrives at a door marked PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY LAB, enters. \nINT. PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY LAB - NIGHT \nThe skeletons throw odd shadows on the ceiling.  Margo's computer screen glows at the end of the room, casting the only light.  But her chair is empty.  The room is quiet.  Pendergast approaches slowly, looks around. \nPENDERGAST Dr. Green? \nNo answer.  Pendergast glances at the computer screen, sees graphs and complicated notations.  He scrolls down, leans closer.  He can't figure it out.  He slides into Margo's chair, fascinated.  Then... \nMARGO (OS) You have a warrant to look at that? \nPendergast leaps up.  Margo has appeared in the doorway behind him, a cup of coffee in her hand. \nPENDERGAST Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI. Forgive me.  I guess I was snooping. What is this? \nMARGO An invention of mine.  It's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its DNA.  I call it the Genetic Sequence Extrapolator. \nPENDERGAST How does it work? \nMARGO With a DNA analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal, whether it was nocturnal, what it ate, how it hunted, how big it was... (abrupt) You aren't here for a lesson in DNA. \nPENDERGAST No. (a moment) I came to talk about Dr. John Whittlesley. \nMargo turns to put down her coffee.  She takes a moment to compose herself.  When she turns back, her voice is quiet. \nMARGO Somehow, when all this happened... I knew it would come back to John.  Is he really dead? \nPENDERGAST Maybe not. \nMARGO If he were alive he'd have contacted me. \nPENDERGAST You have time to talk? \nINT. MUSEUM HALLS - NIGHT \nPendergast and Margo walk together though various exhibits and halls. They pass dioramas of ferocious wild animals that have been tamed and stuffed behind glass. \nPENDERGAST Dr. Whittlesley was last seen in Belem, Venezuela a week after the rest of his expedition disappeared. A taxi driver drove him to the harbor where he boarded a cargo boat.  That boat washed up in my district.  Everyone on board was killed. \nMARGO And John? \nPENDERGAST Disappeared.  His body wasn't among the victims. \nMARGO I don't understand. \nPENDERGAST The people killed were mauled and their brains were eaten.  Just like Beauregard.  One part of the brain was extracted with surgical precision.  The hypothalamus and thalamus to be exact. \nMargo pales. \nMARGO John couldn't have anything to do with a horrible thing like that.  He was a fine man despite his problems -- \nPENDERGAST You loved him. \nMARGO (a moment, taken aback) Yes.  Once.  We met at Columbia.  John held the Cadwalader Chair in Statistical Paleontology when I was a grad student there. \nPENDERGAST You were going to be married. \nMARGO How did you know that? \n", "test3_input": "The group has reached another intersection of tunnels.  The left fork turns back uphill.  D'Agosta indicates this tunnel. \nD'AGOSTA At least we'll be dry. \nThey all press forward in the low vaulted darkness.  As they move steadily upwards the water recedes.  Kawakita's flashlight flickers and he bangs it.  It comes on again. \nKAWAKITA I believe in you a hundred percent, Vince, but that's the second time we've been at that intersection. \nD'AGOSTA Not so loud. \nD'Agosta shines his light forward and they see that the shaft ends in a large round PIPE. \nKAWAKITA What's that? \nD'AGOSTA All right everybody, hold up! \nKawakita and D'Agosta move past the shivering people who are strung out along the sides of the tunnel.  D'Agosta touches each person as he passes. \nD'AGOSTA We don't know what's in there.  Let me go first. \nINT. PIPE - NIGHT \nThe Mayor follows behind with the group as Kawakita and D'Agosta lead the way.  The pipe is dry and rusted.  They move forward with stealth. In twenty feet the pipe ends abruptly in darkness.  D'Agosta steps out first. \nINT. CAVERN - NIGHT \nThe group huddles at the mouth of the pipe, confused, as D'Agosta pans his flashlight around the huge space.  The walls are carved out of dirt and rounded like a cave.  From the ceiling hang huge cobwebs.  There's a large pile of sticks in one corner fashioned rather like a bed.  On a mound of dirt beside this bed rests a battered duffel bag. \nGreg moves to it, shines his light on the side.  A name is written in marker. \nD'AGOSTA What does it say? \nKAWAKITA (looks up, shocked) Dr. John Whittlesley. \nD'AGOSTA What's that doing here? \nKAWAKITA I don't know.  I thought Dr. Whittlesley died in South America. \nMAYOR (interrupts) Look.  There's a ladder at the end.  I think it goes up to the street! \nThey move forward into the darkness eagerly, towards the ladder which leads up to a manhole.  But as they pass the bed of twigs, something loud CRUNCHES underfoot. \nKAWAKITA What is that? \nD'Agosta shines his light down and everyone freezes.  Then one woman SCREAMS! \nThe wide dirt floor around them is carpeted in clean white BONES!  The HUMMING noise is louder and we see its source.  Atop the bones is the body of CUTHBERT!  It's covered with BLACK DERMESTID BEETLES.  They're stripping the skeleton clean, devouring the flesh! \nThe group panics and breaks for the ladder.  Kawakita and D'Agosta once more guard the rear. \nKAWAKITA Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant? \nD'AGOSTA I'd say we're in its home. \nINT. HALL OF THE NORTHWEST COAST INDIANS - NIGHT \nPendergast and Margo run down the long dark room, passing an enormous hollowed-out canoe.  As they exit the far end, the dark shape of Mbwun emerges.  It leaps forward, closing in fast. \nINT. HALL OF THE ASIAN PEOPLES - NIGHT \nMargo and Pendergast enter a series of maze-like room with hidden corners, nooks and crannies with cases full of esoteric Buddhist and Japanese Art.  They're running through the twists and turns as fast as they can. \nPENDERGAST We're not going to make the storage room! \nMARGO Listen to me, Pendergast.  Mbwun's DNA is part homo sapien.  In primates, the eye is a direct path to the brain!  If you get a clean shot, there's only one place you can kill it.  Shoot it in the eye! \nAT THIS THEY ROUND A CORNER AND MBWUN LEAPS OUT!  It circled ahead and was waiting in front of them!  The animal swipes at Margo and Pendergast.  The force of the monster's blow sends Margo reeling and slams Pendergast into the wall.  He falls, crumples and drops his gun! The case beside him SHATTERS spewing relics, as Mbwun pushes past. Pendergast groans and gets to his knees with difficulty. \nMARGO is frantically crawling away in the dark!  The beast makes a low sound of pleasure and reaches out one claw, easily pins her down. Pendergast looks frantically for any kind of weapon! \nON MARGO now PINNED BENEATH the heaving body of the monster! Powerless, she looks up into the horrible face of death as Mbwun raises an enormous claw!  Pendergast, desperate, cries out -- \nPENDERGAST Please, no!  Don't hurt Margo! \nOddly enough, the beast pauses for once.  Talking to the damn thing is the one tactic no one has tried!  The claw halts in mid-air.  The beast blinks once and looks from Pendergast to Margo.  Margo sees a flash of something unexpectedly HUMANin its eyes!  In astonishment, she whispers... \nMARGO My God.  You understand. \n", "test3_true": "MARGO Please let me go.  We won't hurt you. \nA strange noise comes out of the monster.  A low, confused growl.  He doesn't loosen his grip on Margo, but he leans down to look at her closer with one green, unblinking eye. \nShe struggles not to turn away in revulsion.  His enormous jaws are right near her throat.  Everything is very still.  And then... \nA BARRAGE OF FIRE breaks out!  The S.W.A.T. team is in the doorway, laying down everything they've got.  The creature ROARS as if betrayed, leaves Margo and LEAPS UP.  It barrels down on the S.W.A.T. team, picks up Jennings and SPIKES HIM TO THE GROUND.  Jennings hits the floor with his neck at a crazy angle.  It snaps like a twig.  The other men drop back.  Mbwun follows, tearing through the men, cutting a deathly swath! \nPendergast moves to help the S.W.A.T. team.  Margo struggles to her feet and her hand touches the wall.  Beside her is a FIRE HOSE in a cabinet!  In a split second Margo hauls it out, throws a switch and gets a BLAST OF WATER.  She turns it on the beast as it grabs for Pendergast.  The force of the water is enormous.  It pushes the monster out the end of the hall. \nPendergast runs towards her, takes the hose and holds it. \nPENDERGAST Run! \nShe takes off blindly in the maze-like room.  From somewhere behind her she hears a horrible HOWL. \nON MARGO... as she twists and turns through the rows of display cases, tearing blindly in the dark.  Ahead is a door.  She dives through it and finds she's in... \nINT. MEN'S ROOM - MUSEUM - NIGHT \nA row of mirrors and urinals line the wall.  It's a huge room, designed to handle crowds of visitors.  Margo ducks into one of the stalls as MBWUN crashes in.  Margo looks through a crack in the door to see... \nTHE ANIMAL AT FULL STOP.  IT'S STARING AT ITSELF IN THE ROW OF MIRRORS! The sight appalls it and the beast lets out a hideous sound!  The claws lash out, breaking every mirror in the place, littering the floor with glass! \nThen the beast turns and backs up, groaning, as if cornered.  Margo sees now that one limb is dragging, leaving a trail of blood.  The mouth, too, appears to be bleeding.  The S.W.A.T. team's bullets had an affect. \nMargo presses back in the stall, bracing as the beast gets closer. It's just outside.  It sniffs the air once and suddenly turns, rears up, furious and crashes through the bathroom door.  Margo screams and the thing grabs her!  It holds Margo up before it and roars.  It closes its massive claws around her as if she is somehow responsible for everything.  The claws tighten!  She struggles and fights to no purpose ... but then the beast pauses... it's seen something! \nTHE NECKLACE WITH TWO ARROWS AROUND HER NECK! \nIt stops and its grip loosens!  A pained look flashes across its bestial face... \nAnd in that split moment Margo looks down... \nA NECKLACE OF SILVER gleams around the beast's throat too!  The necklace is the twin to her own! \nON MARGO... Can it be possible?  She stares at the thing... \nMARGO John's necklace!  You killed him! \nIncredibly the beast shakes its head.  A noise comes from it... a sad noise, like a groan.  And now Margo gets it!  She can hardly believe it. Her eyes widen in astonishment.  She whispers... \nMARGO Oh Jesus.  John? \nThe name is a knife through the monster's heart! \nMARGO No.  It's not possible! \nThe last piece of the puzzle falls.  The monster is John Whittlesley! Margo, still desperately frightened, tries to keep control. \nMARGO John?  If it is you... I can help. \nThe monster shakes its head no and releases her.  As she watches he moves away, quickly limps out the door. \nINT. HALL OF THE ASIAN PEOPLES - NIGHT \nMbwun now drags himself across the grey carpet, headed for the stairs. In the darkness of the hall of Asian Peoples, Pendergast is waiting. He lifts one of the S.W.A.T. team rifles which he holds in his hands. He aims, is about to fire, but then Margo comes up behind him. \nMARGO No!  Don't kill him!  Pendergast, you were right.  It's John! \nPENDERGAST What? \nMARGO That thing is John Whittlesley.  I should have seen it before!  The fibers are infected with a virus. You eat them, and the virus alters your DNA!  He became addicted to them in South America, followed the plants back to the states.  He probably entered the country as a man.  It would have taken several months for the change to take place. That's how he got from the boat to the museum! \nPendergast looks over and sees the monster.  His eyes show disbelief. Mbwun looks back at both of them briefly, then it disappears up the stairs. \nPENDERGAST I don't believe it. \nMARGO You have to!  Listen!  All viruses pass on their own DNA.  Instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses!  This one was different.  It inserted a whole array of genes into John.  Reptile genes, sixty five million years old.  Those genes remade him!  It's not his fault! \nPENDERGAST Whatever that thing is, we have to kill it! \nMargo tries to stop him, but he shrugs her off. \nEXT. MUSEUM ROOF - NIGHT \nA helicopter hovers outside pouring a circle of light down on the roof.  Ippolito watches as the drunk is pulled up through the hall in a sling.  Waters approaches, holding the walkie talkie. \n"}

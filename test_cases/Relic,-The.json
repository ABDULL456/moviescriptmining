{"test1_input": "PENDERGAST I ran an internet search on Dr. Whittlesley.  Got a list of his scholarly articles and the engagement announcement in the Times.  I also found a record of your restraining order. \nMARGO That was two years ago.  John was still in love with me. (she looks down) He wouldn't leave me alone. \nPENDERGAST You were afraid of him, weren't you? \nMARGO He was afraid of himself.  He tried suicide once.  He was ill.  Manic depressive.  He had wild emotional highs and lows.  Not a happy affliction for a scientist.  He'd been revered in our community.  By the end he was a joke. \nPENDERGAST Tell me about the last expedition. What was he looking for? \nMARGO A legendary monster called Mbwun. \nPENDERGAST A monster? \nMARGO Yes.  He developed his own theory that he called the Calisto Effect. It held that evolution wasn't always gradual or driven by natural selection.  The environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a \"monster species\".  It made no sense. But he felt he had evidence that Mbwun was such a monster, living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years. \nPENDERGAST What happened? \nMARGO No one knows.  The Kothoga who live on the tepui are cannibals. \nMargo's voice catches again.  Pendergast reaches for his handkerchief but she shakes her head, determined to keep control. \nMARGO No.  I'm all right.  I won't let this affect me anymore.  John wouldn't get help.  His ego endangered the lives of others.  His theory came first. \nPENDERGAST What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there?  Was he desperate enough to create one? \nMARGO I don't understand. \nPENDERGAST Something came up in autopsy tonight.  Imbedded in Beauregard's body we found a claw. \nMARGO My God.  Then it was an animal. \nPENDERGAST I don't think so.  I think we were meant to think it was Mbwun.  Did Whittlesley's monster have claws? \nMARGO I don't know.  He sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation.  But I've never seen it.  It's in the exhibit. \nPENDERGAST Would you mind showing it to me? \nINT. SUPERSTITION EXHIBIT - NIGHT \nThis exhibit is unlike anything we've seen in the museum.  Horrifying artifacts under single spots appear to float in a velvet blackness. Patterns of light and shadow play over skeletons and voodoo dolls. There are tombs, a torture chamber, and endlessly curving, maze-like, winding halls. \nPENDERGAST Where would we find it? \nMARGO I'm not sure.  We should split up. You take that hall and I'll take this one. \nPENDERGAST All right.  I'm as macho as you are. Perhaps. \nWithout further discussion, Margo takes the right fork leaving Pendergast behind. \nON MARGO... \nAs she finds herself alone.  The silence is intense.  She heads slowly into another long, dark, tunnel passing a set of Maori tattooed heads. The eyes are stuffed with fibers, the shriveled lips are drawn back from rotting teeth.  Margo passes without a look. \nON PENDERGAST \nIn another part of the exhibit, he nears a Mayan tomb.  A skeleton in the center wears a headdress and tribal robes.  Gold rings encircle bony fingers.  Pendergast takes a moment to appreciate it, heads into the next hall. \nON MARGO \ngetting farther from pendergast, and ever deeper into the gloom.  The walls around her are lined with symbols of witchcraft.  There are shaman dancers, masks covered in grasses and shells.  From the New Guinea coast there is Kokpah, God of a secret male society, and Zoe- ba, an awesome mannequin in black costume with an angry pointed mask. \nFinally the walls open up into another gallery.  Beyond it is more of the shadowy hall.  Margo stops and for the first time she wavers.  This gallery is the most frightening yet.  It features images of THE DEVIL from different cultures around the world. \nIn the dim light, Margo is dwarfed by abhorrent statues of SATAN, TORNARSUK (the Eskimo evil spirit), INCUBI from India, Tibet, New Guinea etc.  And there in the center of the gallery sitting on an altar and lit by a spot, is a small figurine.  Margo is instantly drawn to it.  As she gets close enough she sees the label in Gothic letters. \nMBWUN \nSavage God of the Kothoga, also known as \"HE WHO WALKS ON ALL FOURS\". \nThe statue is terrifyingly life-like.  Margo stares at The Beast.  Mbwun is covered in scales and stiff hair, with glittering green eyes and crude, reptilian features.  The figure is hunched over in a threatening crouch.  It's long forearms trail to the ground ending in THREE LARGE CLAWS! \nON MARGO... she starts, then remembers Pendergast. \nMARGO Mr. Pendergast!  I found it. \nNo answer.  She turns, tries again, louder. \n", "test1_true": "Her voice catches as she stops and sniffs the air.  A STENCH rolls over her.  She covers her face, backs up, holding her breath. \nMARGO What the... \nShe steps directly into a nasty statue of the Tibetan lord of the Dead.  Margo starts, steadies the statue.  The room is silent once more. But then, unmistakably... she hears it.  An odd rustling sound.  Slow. Deliberate.  Maddeningly soft on the thick carpet.  And another wave of THE SMELL.  Margo looks in the direction she came, down the long dark hall.  Her voice comes out a bit frightened as she calls... \nMARGO Pendergast? (no answer) Who's there? \nBut now she freezes.  At last she's truly scared.  A shadow, black against black, is gliding stealthily towards her, moving over the display cases and grinning artifacts! \nMargo stands stock still, her eyes on the shadow.  She lets out a small gasp of shock.  She can't believe her eyes.  It defies reason.  Slowly, she backs up.  She slips quietly through the exhibit and out the other side.  In the next room she pauses again, listens... now hearing a distinctly animal, SNUFFLING SOUND! \nSomething large is TRACKING HER!  There's no doubt. \nOvercome by a blind panic, Margo turns and runs.  She passes through a display on mythical creatures, disappears down another winding dark hall. \nBehind her comes... \nTHE POUNDING OF SOMETHING IN A HEAVY, LOPING RUN!  Whatever it is, it's charging after her!  She turns another corner.  And another, tearing as fast as she can!  But now the walls up ahead are narrowing, leading to ... a DEAD END! \nMargo slams up against a locked door with a window of glass.  The hall features displays of terrifying totem poles.  All around the ghoulish carved faces seem to leap out!  She pounds on the door but it's useless.  She's trapped.  And the thing is coming behind her!  It's just around the last bend when it stops!  Silence again envelops her.  She's afraid to turn.  She can hear HEAVY BREATHING, and something like a low growl!  Reflected in the glass of the door in front of her is the long dark hall.  Margo starts as a face appears IN THE REFLECTION... \nThe image is wavering and unclear.  It's a large, hulking form behind her!  TWO GLOWING SLIT GREEN EYES in the dark!  Margo SCREAMS as the thing leaps forward, hitting one of the totem poles.  Margo sinks to the ground, unconscious.  At last we hear Pendergast calling as darkness falls. \nPENDERGAST Dr. Green!  Dr. Green! \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. SUPERSTITION EXHIBIT - NIGHT \nON MARGO... lying on the carpet.  There's a large, nasty bump on her forehead.  The totem pole is on the floor beside her.  Leaning over her is PENDERGAST.  Margo starts to sit up.  Pendergast gently restrains her. \nPENDERGAST What happened? \nMARGO I don't know. \nPENDERGAST I heard you calling and I ran after you, but you kept disappearing and I couldn't keep up. \nMARGO (she touches her forehead) You were behind me?  Running after me? \nPendergast nods.  As Margo rises he tries to help her but she waves him off, collecting her thoughts. \nMARGO It's okay, I'm all right.  I remember now... It was an animal.  Something large!  I could smell it.  It was hunting me.  I saw two green eyes in the dark. \nPENDERGAST Where did you see it? \nMARGO Behind me.  Over there. \nMargo turns and points behind her to... \nA large NORTHWEST COAST INDIAN MASK.  It's carved out of wood in a horrible grimace, inset with two glowing green eyes.  Pendergast sees it too, says nothing. \nMARGO That's not what I saw. \nPENDERGAST All right.  If you're positive. \nShe leans against the wall, touches her forehead, panic overcoming her again. \nMARGO (CON'T) I can't think straight at the moment.  I know how crazy this seems. Please, Mr. Pendergast, I need some fresh air.  Could you get me out of here? \nEXT. ROTUNDA FRONT ENTRY - EXHIBIT - NIGHT \nTHREE COPS including MCNITT, RODRIGUEZ and ROGERS prepare to enter the exhibit.  All are armed.  Margo watches as Pendergast gives them instruction.  She appears rattled and confused. \nPENDERGAST Stay in formation together.  Take it room by room.  Check for footprints, any signs of disturbance.  If you see or hear anything the least bit suspicious, I want to know. \nHe points to DOYLE, an older red-haired cop who takes up a post outside the exhibit.  Pendergast hands Doyle his walkie talkie. \nPENDERGAST Bailey's going to be in the guard house outside.  Officer Van Dorn is right down that hall.  When McNitt's done, he'll relieve you. \nDoyle nods.  Pendergast and Margo walk out. \nEXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT \nMargo and Pendergast exit.  The cold air is like a slap in the face. \nPENDERGAST Dr. Green... \n", "test1_id": 2457, "test2_input": "D'AGOSTA Step back! \nD'Agosta, Frank and Kawakita aim their guns at the door and shoot repeatedly.  The shots echo wildly.  The sound is terrifyingly loud.  The small glass window shatters.  Then the men lean heavily on the door.  It still won't budge.  D'Agosta looks through the window. \nD'AGOSTA It's no use.  We have to get out of here! (to Kawakita) Give them your walkie talkie. \nKawakita hands his walkie talkie through the window.  Margo takes it. \nKAWAKITA Is Dr. Frock safe! \nMARGO Yes, he's fine.  Greg... take care of yourself! \nINT. HALL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MAMMALS - NIGHT \nPendergast looks desperately at the blueprints. \nMARGO Is there another way around? \nPENDERGAST No.  The planetarium is in the next cell.  This is one of the fire doors... \nPendergast returns to the window. \nPENDERGAST Vince?  There's no way we can get to you with the fire doors down. There's an entrance to the sub- basement in the hall off the north side exit. \nD'AGOSTA The sub-basement? \nPENDERGAST I've been down there.  It links up to the old sewer system.  I can guide you out. \nD'Agosta turns to the others. \nD'AGOSTA How much ammo do we have to make a stand? \nKAWAKITA You're asking me?  I don't even know how to load this thing. \nFRANK Four rounds... \nThere's a movement of air... and a ripe, fetid smell. \nD'AGOSTA Oh shit. \nD'Agosta pumps his shot gun. \nD'AGOSTA I smell it.  It's here. \nPENDERGAST Go out the north exit!  There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases.  Run! \nD'AGOSTA Everybody.  Get behind me. \nThe others move past.  D'Agosta, Frank and Greg Kawakita hold the rear. The group runs to the side exit to the planetarium and in a moment, disappears. \nINT. HALL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MAMMALS - NIGHT \nPendergast remains at the window watching anxiously.  From the south entrance to the planetarium, an ENORMOUS DARK SHAPE slinks into view! Pendergast steps back from the doorway, turns to Margo. \nPENDERGAST Hide quickly! \nMARGO What are you going to do? \nPendergast checks his gun, totally calm. \nPENDERGAST Buy them some time. \nMargo turns and looks around at the looming dioramas.  There's a plain door at their end of the hall.  Pendergast faces the broken window. \nHIS POV... the beast is slinking away after D'Agosta and the others, headed to the north exit from the Planetarium! \nPENDERGAST calls out... \nPENDERGAST Hey you big tub of lard!  Over here! \nTHE BEAST PAUSES, turns. \nPendergast puts his palms up at his ears, wiggles his fingers and makes a face through the window. \nPENDERGAST Come on, you smelly pile of refuse. Come get me.  I dare you! \nA LOW surprised GROWL comes from the beast.  It crouches as if to pounce.  Pendergast makes more faces, sticks his tongue out.  The beast watches in silence, its evil eyes fixed. \n", "test2_true": "MARGO What is it doing? \nPENDERGAST (loud) It's scared of me. \nSuddenly there's a CRASH and the door BENDS like cardboard.  TWO HUGE SETS OF CLAWS lash through!  Margo screams as the claws pass inches from Pendergast's face.  He leaps back, lifts his gun which looks like a pea shooter in the face of Mbwun. \nTwo sets of claws curve around the bent edges of the door, then Mbwun simply LIFTS it out of the frame.  This leaves Pendergast face to face with the foul, enormous monster!  It regards him evenly, blinks once. Then the tongue slides out, licks its lips eagerly and... \nPendergast FLICKS on his high powered FLASHLIGHT, shining it at close range right in the beast's eyes!  Then carefully, with total calm he FIRES ONCE, TWICE.  The beast howls more in anger than pain, REARS UP and swipes at Pendergast.  Pendergast dives to one side and, the claws miss again by inches as the beast is temporarily blinded by the light. Now Pendergast spins and runs for all he's worth.  Margo's been waiting, holding the door. \nPENDERGAST Drop the fibers! \nShe leaves the crate behind as Pendergast dives inside with her.  Margo shoves the door shut hard as Mbwun, still blinded, leaps into the hall.  But now, suddenly, all is quiet.  No sign of Margo and Pendergast.  The beast moves forward, snuffling slowly.  It starts for the door which hides Margo and Pendergast, but stops as it finds... \nTHE CRATE!  The beast moves to it, clearly surprised.  It pokes at the crate carefully, inhales the fragrance and grunts.  The monster seems to be struggling with itself!  It sniffs the fibers, lifts a few out carefully, then SHOVES THE CRATE AWAY HARD.  Then it rises on its haunches and squints into the dark. \nOn all sides are glowing displays of stuffed buffalo, gazelle, wild horses, wolves, giant elk, sabre tooth tigers.  Mbwun moves close to one after another.  Suddenly we notice, in the back of one of the dioramas... \nMargo and Pendergast!  They stand frozen, crouching behind mannequins of native Americans riding horses across the plains.  The beast sniffs RIGHT AT THEIR WINDOW, then turns away.  Confused, it heads back towards the Planetarium and slinks from the room. \nINSIDE THE DIORAMA... Pendergast and Margo exchange an astonished look. They whisper. \nPENDERGAST What happened? \nMARGO Its eyesight is worse than I thought.  It couldn't see us.  And it couldn't smell us through the glass. \nPENDERGAST It didn't want the fibers.  What does that mean? \nMARGO I think... it means it's full. \nPENDERGAST Then it won't go after the others? \nMARGO No.  It's still hunting, but not for the hormones. \nPENDERGAST For what? \nMARGO I think... for the pleasure of the kill. \nINT. HALLWAY - MUSEUM - NIGHT \nGreg, the Mayor, D'Agosta and the others are in a hallway lined with at least a dozen vases.  A GREEK VASE has been shoved aside revealing the outlines of a door.  Behind is a sloping dark corridor.  The last of the thirty-five people pack in.  Greg and D'Agosta cover the corridor. \nD'AGOSTA That's it, let's go! \nGrim-faced, D'Agosta follows Kawakita as they duck through the doorway, shutting it behind them.  The impact rattles the wall and the Greek vase falls. \nINT. SUB-BASEMENT - NIGHT \nKawakita and D'Agosta reach the bottom and turn to see the Mayor, his wife, Dr. Pound and their whole group standing in several feet of rushing water.  Lauren is shivering.  Her father has his arm around her tight.  Behind them are two corridors, one forking left and the other straight.  D'Agosta gets out the walkie talkie, clicks it on. \nD'AGOSTA (into walkie talkie) Pendergast.  We made it.  You all right? \nINT. DIORAMA - NIGHT \nPendergast has the plans open as he studies them.  He speaks into the walkie talkie.  Margo paces behind him, thinking hard. \nPENDERGAST We're fine.  Take the left fork behind you.  You'll be in a straight passage.  When the hall forks again in fifty yards go right.  Then radio back. \nINT. SUB-BASEMENT - NIGHT \nD'Agosta shuts off his walkie talkie.  Everyone's staring at him. \nD'AGOSTA All right.  Kawakita, cover the rear. \nKAWAKITA Oh shit. \nFRANK No, Lieutenant.  He's not a good enough shot.  I'll do it if you take care of my daughter. \nD'Agosta nods.  Frank expertly reloads.  D'Agosta holsters the walkie talkie and they plunge down the left hand passage.  Kawakita takes charge of Lauren, who is confused and terrified.  The tunnel has a slight downhill grade, and the water begins to move faster, tugging at everyone's legs.  People slip and slide as they half make their way down the hill.  D'Agosta calls behind them. \nD'AGOSTA Damn.  It's getting deep.  See anything? \nON FRANK... back not far from the first fork.  He looks towards the head of the tunnel, calls out... \nFRANK You'll be the first to know. \nFrank turns and plunges after the others.  But then suddenly, he stops. \n", "test2_id": 2458, "test3_input": "WATERS We can't raise the S.W.A.T. team.  No one's answering!  What do you want to do? \nIppolito eyes are fixed on the room below them. \nIPPOLITO Holy shit.  Pull him up. \nLightning throws horrible shadows of the hulking dinosaur skeletons all around as MBWUN LIMPS INTO THE HALL!  The men on the roof stare down astonished.  Their mouths hang open at the sight! \nIPPOLITO Get more guns!  Now! \nThe men get the drunk up and abandon the sling, leaving Jonathan trapped below. \nINT. HALL OF THE DINOSAURS - NIGHT \nJonathan and Hobbes take cover behind one of the dinosaurs and hide. Mbwun sees Jonathan, lifts both claws, SWINGS at the skeleton, sending it crashing down!  Jonathan SCREAMS, Hobbes is caught and falls.  He scrambles into a corner, whimpering, as Pendergast and Margo appear in the door.  Fifteen more S.W.A.T. team members with rifles now line the hole in the roof.  They all point their guns at Mbwun. \nIPPOLITO Get back!  We're going to shoot! \nNow Margo runs forward. \nMARGO No.  Wait!  Let me talk to him first! \nIPPOLITO (screaming) Kill that thing!  Kill it now! \nMARGO No! \nMBWUN... turns and sees Margo.  She speaks desperately. \nMARGO John... you can give up now!  Just lie down where you are! \nMbwun seems to consider for a moment, but then its eyes gleam and it ROARS.  With renewed vigor it leaps to the wall and starts to WALK UP IT like a GECKO, ON ALL FOURS!  ON THE ROOF... \nSome of the S.W.A.T. team fall back in terror!  Now that the monster is on the wall it's out of range of their fire! \nWATERS Holy shit it's coming this way! \nIPPOLITO It's headed for the roof.  Run! \nIppolito turns and takes off once more in sheer terror.  Astonished, Waters tries to regain control. \nWATERS Get back here, you asshole!  We can't let it get out! (to the S.W.A.T. team) Surround the opening and kill it! \nBut the men are terrified, retreating like Ippolito.  Waters shouts. \nWATERS Back, everybody!  That's an order! \nBut the team is in chaos and losing precious time. \nINT. HALL OF THE DINOSAURS - NIGHT \nThe MONSTER is now half way up the wall.  Margo is distraught, crying. Her cool demeanor is cracked.  Pendergast is with her.  She shakes her head. \nMARGO Just like John.  He won't listen. \nPENDERGAST I have to shoot. \nMARGO Do it, quickly.  Please.  Aim for the eye. \nPendergast raises a HIGH POWERED RIFLE with a laser sight.  He aims the red laser beam directly at Mbwun's left eye. \nPENDERGAST He has to look here or I won't get a clear shot.  Call him, Margo. \nMARGO I can't! \nPENDERGAST You have to.  Do it now! \nMargo takes a moment, her eyes streaming.  She has no choice, she calls out. \nMARGO John!  John, look at me! \nThe beast looks down, sees Pendergast's rifle.  There's a long, awful, moment.  Suddenly it emits a sound like a wail. \nON JONATHAN... staring, stunned. \nPENDERGAST... steady... \nMARGO...

Greg Kawakita, wet and bedraggled as a rat, runs up from Columbus Ave.  Behind him the Mayor and D'Agosta help the rest of the company to the ambulances. \nWaters is on the steps of the museum, helping to organize the rescue efforts as Kawakita runs up to Pendergast. \nKAWAKITA Margo Green.  Have you seen her? \nPENDERGAST She's over here. \nGreg turns to see Margo come out of the Rotunda with Frock, Jonathan and Hobbes.  Her face is devastated.  He moves to her side.  She reacts as she sees him, and teacher and pupil hug. \nD'AGOSTA is lost in the swirl of people.  And he likes it like that.  He rests against a large stone lion, pulls out a cheap cigar in cellophane, unwraps it carefully and tries to light it with a wet match. \nHe's struggling hopelessly.  Finally he tosses the useless pack of matches, sighs.  But then a flame lowers right before his face.  He looks up to see Pendergast holding a silver engraved lighter.  D'Agosta smiles, takes a nice long hit. \nPENDERGAST Nice to see you, Lieutenant. \nD'AGOSTA The sub-basement, huh?  Great idea. \nWe go to a wide shot of the museum as we slowly pull back... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM - DAY - SUPER TITLE: SEVERAL MONTHS LATER \nChristmas decorations are up.

She turns and walks into the back office.  Kawakita is working there alone. His fly-fishing rod stands in the corner, untouched.  Margo goes to it, smiles softly. \nMARGO No time for fishing anymore? \nGreg looks up from his work and smiles. \nKAWAKITA Got to finish this thesis sometime. \nMARGO How about lunch? \nKAWAKITA Not today.  Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you. \nMARGO Okay. \nMargo exits.  Greg returns to his work. \nINT.

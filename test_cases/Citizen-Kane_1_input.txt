As the dissolve completes itself, camera is travellling across the floor of the chapel past the crypts of Kane's father and mother - (marked: James Kane - 18- TO 19-; Mary Kane - 18- TO 19-;) - past a blank crypt, and then holding on the burial of Kane's son.  A group of ordinary workmen in ordinary clothes are lowering a very expensive-looking coffin into its crypt. Kane stands nearby with Raymond, looking on.  The men strain and grunt as the coffin bangs on the stone floor.  The men now place over it a long marble slab on which is cut the words: 
CHARLES FOSTER KANE II. 
ONE OF THE WORKMEN Sorry, Mr. Kane, we won't be able to cement it till tommorrow.  We - 
Kane looks right through him.  Raymond cuts him short. 
RAYMOND Okay. 
The men tip their hats and shuffle out of the chapel.  Kane raises his head, looks at the inscription on the wall.  It is a little to one side of Junior's grave, directly over the blank place which will be occupied by Kane himself. 
KANE Do you like poetry, Raymond? 
RAYMOND Can't say, sir. 
KANE Mrs. Kane liked poetry - 
Raymond is now convinced that the old master is very far gone indeed - not to say off his trolley. 
RAYMOND Yes, Mr. Kane. 
KANE Not my wife - not either of them. 
He looks at the grave next to his son's - the grave marked "MARY KANE." 
RAYMOND (catching on) Oh, yes, sir. 
KANE (looking back up at the wall) Do you know what that is? 
RAYMOND (more his keeper than his butler now) It's a wall you bought in China, Mr. Kane. 
KANE Persia.  It belonged to a king. 
RAYMOND How did you get him to part with it, Mr. Kane? 
KANE He was dead...  That's a poem.  Do you know what it means? 
RAYMOND No, I don't, Mr. Kane. 
KANE I didn't used to be afraid of it. 
A short pause.  His eyes still on the wall, but looking through it, Kane quotes the translation. 
KANE The drunkeness of youth has passed like a fever, And yet I saw many things, Seeing my glory in the days of my glory, I thought my power eternal And the days of my life Fixed surely in the years But a whisper came to me From Him who dies not.  I called my tributary kings together And those who were proud rulers under me, I opened the boxes of my treasure to them, saying: "Take hills of gold, moutains of silver, And give me only one more day upon the earth." But they stood silent, Looking upon the ground; So that I died And Death came to sit upon my throne.  O sons of men You see a stranger upon the road, You call to him and he does not step.  He is your life Walking towards time, Hurrying to meet the kings of India and China. (quoting) O sons of men You are caught in the web of the world And the spider Nothing waits behind it.  Where are the men with towering hopes? They have changed places with owls, Owls who have lived in tombs And now inhabit a palace. 
Kane still stares at the wall, through it, and way beyond it. Raymond looks at him. 
DISSOLVE OUT: 
DISSOLVE IN: 
INT. GREAT HALL - XANADU - NIGHT - 
Thompson and Raymond.  Raymond has finished his beer. 
RAYMOND (callously) That's the whole works, right up to date. 
THOMPSON Sentimental fellow, aren't you? 
RAYMOND Yes and no. 
THOMPSON (getting to his feet) Well, thanks a lot. 
RAYMOND See what I mean?  He was a little gone in the head - the last couple of years, anyway - but I knew how to handle him. (rises) That "Rosebud" - that don't mean anything.  I heard him say it. He just said "Rosebud" and then he dropped that glass ball and it broke on the floor.  He didn't say anything about that, so I knew he was dead - He said all kind of things I couldn't make out.  But I knew how to take care of him. 
Thompson doesn't answer. 
RAYMOND You can go on asking questions if you want to. 
THOMPSON (coldly) We're leaving tonight.  As soon as they're through photographing the stuff - 
Thompson has risen.  Raymond gets to his feet and goes to the door, opening it for him. 
RAYMOND Allow yourself plenty of time. The train stops at the Junction On signal - but they don't like to wait.  Not now.  I can remember when they'd wait all day ... if Mr. Kane said so. 
Raymond ushes Thompson into 
INT. THE GREAT HALL - XANADU - NIGHT - 
The magnificent tapestries, candelabra, etc., are still there, but now several large packing cases are piled against the walls, some broken open, some shut and a number of objects, great and small, are piled pell mell all over the place.  Furniture, statues, paintings, bric-a-brac - things of obviously enormous value are standing beside a kitchen stove, an old rocking chair and other junk, among which is also an old sled, the self-same story.  Somewhere in the back, one of the vast Gothic windows of the hall is open and a light wind blows through the scene, rustling the papers. 
In the center of the hall, a Photographer and his Assistant are busy photographing the sundry objects.  The floor is littered with burnt-out flash bulbs.  They continue their work throughout the early part of the scene so that now and then a flash bulb goes off.  In addition to the Photographer and his Assistant, there are a Girl and Two Newspaperment - the Second and Third Men of the projection room scene - also Thompson and Raymond. 
The Girl and the Second Man, who wears a hat, are dancing somewhere in the back of the hall to the music of a phonograph. A flash bulb goes off.  The Photographer has just photographed a picture, obviously of great value, an Italian primitive. The Assistant consults a label on the back of it. 
ASSISTANT NO. 9182 
The Third Newspaperman starts to jot this information down. 
ASSISTANT "Nativity" - attributed to Donatello, acquired Florence 1921, cost 45,000 lira.  Got that? 
THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN Yeah. 
PHOTOGRAPHER All right!  Next!  Better get that statue over there.

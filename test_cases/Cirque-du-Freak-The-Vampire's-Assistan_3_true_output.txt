A BOA OCCIDENTALIS Probing the confines of its glass prison. A BOA CONSTRICTOR by any other name. It's a prison within a prison because we're inside... 
THE SCHOOL SCIENCE LAB - DAY The teacher, MR. DALTON, moves ponderously around the room. His voice like a metronome. 
MR. DALTON As you can see reptiles and amphibians are not one in the same. As Mr. Dalton continues, we see various PAIRS OF STUDENTS, their computer screens showing text or pictures of various FROGS, ALLIGATORS and LIZARDS... DARREN and STEVE sit together staring at a Komodo Dragon. After Mr. Dalton passes by, Steve switches screen views. He's done a WebSearch of Cirque du Freak. There are a dozen or so entries. He picks one: History of the Side Show. Under 1920's there's an older, much more 'Victorian' pamphlet for the Cirque du Freak. A more ornate version of the same Wolf Head. The same notice from the proprietor. Steve spreads the flyer out to compare. They whisper: 
STEVE 
DARREN Must be a different one. Steve scrolls down through pictures: 
Sword swallower and glass eater: OHIO GRAY. Frog boy: AVERY CHILDS. Human skeleton: J.D. COMBS. .and then... Egyptian Soothsayer: LARTEN CREPSLEY. Crepsley's gaze is startling. Like he can see through the screen, even from 1923. Steve looks like he's just seen a ghost. Suddenly, he hits print. As a PRINTER against the wall clicks to life, Steve looks back at Darren. 
STEVE I gotta show you something...

EXT. THE SHAN HOUSE - DAY 
Picture perfect: two stories, dormers, trellises. 9-year-old ANNIE rides up on her bike, bookbag over her shoulder. Without stopping, she hops off, dumps it on the lawn by two other bikes. A few steps and she's through the door.

INT. DARREN'S ROOM - DAY 
Moody for the daytime. Only the light from the half-closed blinds streaking the floor where: Darren and Steve are huddled over several clippings and pictures that Steve has spread out. They all deal with VAMPIRES in some form or another. Steve pulls another stack from his backpack, spreads them out as well. 
DARREN I don't get it. 
STEVE Vampires. I've been studying them. Vampires? Darren looks at him a beat. 
DARREN Right. You're failing half your classes at school, but you're studying vampires. 
STEVE They been around 1000's of years. Two tribes. They even fight wars. 
DARREN What? When? 
STEVE Okay, sometimes, when humans fight? They fight at the same time. And no one knows it. Like at the Battle of Stalingrad they fought at the same time the Russians and Germans were fighting. Darren just looks at him, wonders if he's serious. 
STEVE Some people know about it. There have even been books written. He pulls a frayed old yellow hardcover from his bag. 
DARREN That's your proof? It smells. Steve's really trying to convince him now. 
STEVE It's everywhere if you look. On the internet, in blogs, newspapers, weird places. But you can find it. The room starts to tighten a notch around them. 
STEVE I chatted online with one of them. 
DARREN Come on. 
STEVE Serious. We become aware of... 
A SINISTER POV Someone watching Darren and Steve through the half open doorway. It moves in, starts coming up from behind. 
DARREN What was his name? Mr. Dracula? Mad now, Steve opens the book, flips pages, finds an old 19th Century painting. He slaps down the science lab internet print-out of Larten Crepsley. It's the same guy! Maybe... 
STEVE Here he is in 1923. And here 1855. Huh? Maybe he'll be there tonight. Would that make you believe? As Darren looks them over, the POV looms up behind them. Suddenly Darren spins... And ROARS at what's behind them: his sister Annie. She SCREAMS in response. Steve jumps a mile. Darren LAUGHS. 
ANNIE How'd you know? 
DARREN Saw your shadow on the floor. Gotta try harder, knucklehead. Steve snaps his book shut, shoves it in his backpack. 
STEVE I'm gonna get a soda.

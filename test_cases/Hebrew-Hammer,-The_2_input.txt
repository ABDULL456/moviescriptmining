ADL CHAIRMAN Only problem is, ever since we kicked him out, he wants nothing to do with us. There's no way we can persuade him to come back. 
Esther lifts her skirt a few inches. 
ESTHER Perhaps I can persuade him. 
STAR OF DAVID WIPE TO: 
INT. HEBREW HAMMER INVESTIGATIONS - PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY 
A shoddy low-rent office replete with Film Noirish lighting via the blinds. The Hammer fiddles with a dreidel as he sits with his feet propped up on his desk. His Shtreml hat is skewed to one side and a toothpick dangles from his lips. 
HAMMER (V.O.) It was the day before Hanukkah when she strolled into my office. 
There is knock at the door. 
HAMMER (CONT'D) Come in. 
The door opens to reveal a long denim skirt covering every possible inch of flesh. We tilt up the length of the skirt to reveal Esther. She is breathtakingly sexy. 
The Hammer quickly removes his feet from the table. Esther approaches his desk and sits. 
ESTHER Mr. Jefferson Carver? 
HAMMER Please, call me Mordechai. 
HAMMER (V.O.) (CONT'D) From the way she carried herself I could tell she'd been around the block a few times... 
ESTHER Sorry I'm late. Traffic was a pisher, and I've been circling the block for the past half hour looking for parking. What are you listening to? 
HAMMER (V.O.) Oh, the things I would do to her if I had the... 
The Hammer attempts to press stop on his tape recorder, but accidentally FAST FORWARDS to another part of the tape. We hear the sound of SEXUAL INTERCOURSE. The Hammer scrambles for the STOP button. 
HAMMER (CONT'D) Client notes. Sorry. (Beat) What can I do for you? 
ESTHER My name is Esther. Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal from the Jewish Defense League desperately needs to speak with you. 
HAMMER How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on? 
ESTHER (Annoyed) Actually, his days of marital infidelity have long since past. Now he just shtoops my mother exclusively. 
The Hammer makes the realization. 
HAMMER Your mother? Oh. Whoops. 
ESTHER Mordechai, Santa Claus has been rubbed out by his son Damian. The man's a demon. There's no telling what this new anti semitic psycho Santa is capable of. 
HAMMER I'm sorry to hear about Santa. He was a good friend, but my days... 
The Hammer stops himself and glances over Esther's shoulder. 
In the doorway stands a BLONDE BOMBSHELL in a mink coat. 
BLONDE BOMBSHELL Mr. Hammer? I'd like to hire you to put a tail on my husband. I think my life might be in danger. I think he wants to kill me. 
HAMMER Sorry Shiksa, I think you got the wrong office. I'm the Hebrew Hammer. Mike Hammer's down the hall. 
The Blonde Bombshell is confused for a moment. 
BLONDE BOMBSHELL Oh. 
She leaves. 
HAMMER Listen. Esther, you seem like a nice girl, so I'm only gonna say this once. I no longer affiliate myself with that organization. The politics there were brutal. Besides, I've already got a full case load. 
Esther looks down at his desk. 
We cut to a shot of the Hammer's In/Out Box. Both are completely empty, and thickly coated with spiderwebs.

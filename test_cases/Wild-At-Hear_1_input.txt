SAILOR Lula, darlin...  Makes no difference anyway...  Were outta here. 
We watch the car disappear up the street.  Slowly the camera pans and Reggie and Drop Shadow come walking happily along the sidewalk - whistling. 
CUT TO: 
94. INT. THUNDERBIRD 
Lula and Sailor are motoring along. 
SAILOR Sweetheart, keep your panties up. Were in Jimmy Swaggart country. 
Sailor and Lula both laugh.  Up ahead, Sailor spots a hitchhiker.  He slows to pick him up. 
LULA Sure you wanna do this?  Might be a way they could track us. 
SAILOR Hes just a regular guyt needs help, honey.  Look at him. 
The HITCHHIKER is a man about thirty with a pack on his back, and he is carrying a large, covered cardboard box.  He is filthy, with an uneven smile that exposes his jagged yellow teeth.  Lula opens the door for him, and after he loads his stuff, Sailor takes off down the highway. 
ROACH Thanks a lot.  I been standin out there off and on for two hours, ha-ha! Since noon about, ha-ha!  Cops catch ya hitchin on a Interstate around here they throw ya on a county road crew for a week, less you can pay the ticket, ha-ha!  Which I aint got, ha-ha! 
SAILOR My names Sailor, and this heres Lula.  Whats yours? 
ROACH Marvin DeLoach.  But everbody calls me Roach, ha-ha!  Roach DeLoach, ha-ha! 
LULA You always make that strange little funny laugh when you talk? 
ROACH Aint laughin, ha-ha! 
SAILOR What you got in the box? 
ROACH My dogs, ha-ha! 
Roach slides the top off and tilts the box slightly toward the front. Inside are six small husky pups that are not more than two weeks old. 
ROACH Im headed to Alaska, ha-ha!  These dogs is gonna be my sled team, ha-ha! 
LULA (to Sailor) This guys crazy. 
SAILOR Where you from, Roach? 
ROACH If you mean where I was born, it was Belzoni, Missippi, ha-ha!  But I been brought up in Baton Rouge. 
LULA Why you goin to Alaska?  And whered you get them puppies?  They look sick. 
Roach stares down into the box at the baby huskies and strokes each of them twice with a religiously unwashed hand.  The dogs whimper and lick his dirty fingers. 
ROACH I saw this movie on TV, ha-ha!  The Call of the Wild.  I aint never seen snow, ha-ha!  I got these dogs at the pound.  Nobody wanted em, ha-ha!  Everbody here got theirself pit bulls or some kinda hounds.  Im gonna feed these boys good so theyll be big and powerful and they can pull me real fast through the snow, ha-ha! 
Roach pulls a piece of raw cows liver out of one of his pockets of his field jacket and begins ripping little bits off it and feeding them to the dogs. 
LULA (screeches as she sees this) Sailor!  Stop!  Stop the car now! 
Sailor pulls off the road onto the shoulder of the highway and stops. Lula opens her door and jumps out. 
LULA Im sorry, but I cant take this. Roach, or whatever your name is, you come out of there with them dogs this instant! 
Roach sticks the liver back in his pocket and pulls his pack and the box of tiny canines after him.  Once he and his belongings are deposited on the roadside, Lula hops back in the car and slams the door. 
LULA Im truly sorry?  Im truly sorry, Roach.  But aint gonna make it to Alaska?  Least not any part of the way with us.  Youd best find a party to take care of those dogs proper, before they all die?  And, if you dont mind my sayin so?  You could most certainly use some serious lookin after yourself, startin with a bath! 
Lula takes a pair of sunglasses off the dashboard and puts them on. 
LULA Drive. 
Sailor takes off. 
SAILOR You dont feel you was a little hard on the guy, honey? 
LULA I know youre thinkin that I got moren some of my mama in me?  Well, I couldnt help it.  Sailor, I really couldnt.  Im sorry for that guy, but when he pulled that drippin hunk of awful-smellin meat out of his pocket?  I near barfed.  And them poor diseased puppies! 
SAILOR (laughs) Just part of life on the road, peanut. 
LULA Do me a favor, Sailor?  Dont pick up no more hitchers, okay? 
CUT TO: 
95. INT. INEZS FAIS-DODO BAR - NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT/ 95A. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - MARIETTAS BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Johnnie is seated in a telephone booth at the back of the bar. 
JOHNNIE No, Marietta, I havent found em. 
MARIETTA This is the kinda mistake can take a Hindus lifetime to unfix... You better get a move on, Johnnie, before that boy got her holdin down a Memphis streetcorner and shootin dope up her arms. 
We see Reggie and Drop Shadow enter the bar.  Reggies unsmiling eyes drift across the room until they see Johnnie in the booth.  He stares coldly and waits.  Drop Shadow adjusts his socks. 
JOHNNIE Really, Marietta, you got more scenarios swimmin around in your brain than Carter got pills.  Try to take it easy.  Go over to Myrtle Beach for a few days. 
MARIETTA Im stayin right here by the phone until you find Lula, then Im comin to get her.  You call soons you got somethin, even if its three in the a.m. 
JOHNNIE I will, Marietta.  Goodbye now.

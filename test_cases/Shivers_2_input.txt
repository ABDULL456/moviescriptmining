The first box she tries is empty. She advances to the next and the next, finally finding one that has a jug in it. She takes it and advances to Tudor's box, jug swinging, companion trailing after her in admiration. She stops at Tudor's milk box and flicks the door open. 
She looks inside, just about to reach for the jug that nestles back in the shadows. Ugh! What's that? 
The boy takes a look. Inside the box a third parasite can just be seen clinging to a three-quart white plastic milk jug. The jug is smeared with blood. The box's inside door is ajar. The TV set can be heard from inside the apartment. 
BOY I dunno. Guess the milk went bad. (shrugs) It's still worth money. 
The girl hesitates for a second. Suddenly the parasite twitches around to the front of the jug. The girl, startled, slams the box door shut. 
GIRL Jesus! 
BOY Let's get outta here before somebody hears us! 
The children run off down the hallway together. After a few seconds, the box door is nudged open again from the inside. 
INT. TUDOR'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT 
Janine sits down in front of the TV set. After a moment or two she gets up, turns the set off, and flops back down on the sofa with her Vogue. 
She doesn't notice a trail of bloody slime leading from the bedroom to the inside door of the milk box. 
In the bedroom, a hand reaches down and pulls back a bedsheet to reveal a naked abdomen. It is Tudor's abdomen, and he reaches out with trembling fingers to touch a lump the size of a chicken egg stretching the skin to one side of his navel. 
Tudor watches the lump in the muted light of his bedroom. He gradually extends his hand toward the lump, which disappears the instant it's touched. 
TUDOR (delirious, voice strained, whispering) Come here, boy. Here, boy, here. 
He taps and scratches the skin near his navel, as though trying to lure a cat into attacking his fingers. 
He is propped up in bed, sweating profusely, half-dressed. He looks weak and drained, but still manages to smile with maniacal intensity, his eyes wide and bright. 
TUDOR Come on, fella. Thataboy. You and me, we're gonna be friends, aren't we? 
We can now see that the sheets are twisted, the pillows half off the bed. Tudor begins drumming on his abdomen. 
Gradually, cautiously, the lump under Tudor's skin returns. He tries to seize the lump with his fingers and it shrinks back, almost disappearing into his abdominal cavity again. 
Tudor seems disappointed. 
TUDOR No, no, no. Don't run away, boy. I'm not going to hurt you. Not going to hurt you. We're going to be friends. Friends.

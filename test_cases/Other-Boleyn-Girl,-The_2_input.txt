MARY is asleep. Dead of night. Suddenly she wakes up, and holds her stomach, `Ouch!'. 
It's the first contraction. 
INT. SIR THOMAS'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME SIR THOMAS is asleep. The sound of voices. A commotion outside. The sound of banging on his door.. 
STAFFORD Sir Thomas! It's Mary..! 
INT. MARY'S ROOM - NIGHT MARY cries out in pain. The contractions become stronger. MIDWIVES and PHYSICIANS urgently do their business. Pots of boiling water. Primitive surgical instruments. 
PRIEST arrives, ready to perform the last rites.. 
INT. MARY'S ROOM - NIGHT The DUKE of NORFOLK, SIR THOMAS, and GEORGE BOLEYN arrive in MARY's bedroom, and stare anxiously as the labour begins in earnest.. 
SIR THOMAS Does the King know? 
(CONTINUED) 
A 
GEORGE He's on his way. 
ANNE, who overhears this, surreptitiously adjusts her dress. 
MARY screams in agony. The labour is well and truly under way. Medically, it's a primitive, brutal affair.. 
No comprehension of sterilisation. MIDWIVES have dirty hands. PHYSICIANS use rusty, blood-stained instruments.. 
Presently: the KING arrives with several COURTIERS.. 
SIR THOMAS Any moment, your Grace. 
But the KING hasn't heard. He has seen ANNE. Suddenly, it's as if all sound, all vision disappears, except for ANNE. He stands beside her.. 
All around them the violence and dramatic activity of the birth unfolding; but for all their connection with it, HENRY and ANNE might as well be in a rose garden.. 
HENRY Anne.. 
ANNE stares ahead at MARY's bed.. 
HENRY Anne, I love you.. 
ANNE Your Grace, this is not the time.. 
HENRY I love you Anne. I cannot stop thinking about you. I cannot eat, I cannot sleep.. 
ANNE But how could I ever TRUST you? 
NORFOLK cranes his neck to listen.. 
ANNE When I have seen how you have betrayed first your wife. And now my sister. 
HENRY takes ANNE to one side... 
HENRY I vow from this moment forth I will never lie with my wife, or speak to your sister again. I will do anything you ask.. 
(CONTINUED) 
A 
A 
MARY's contractions build. Birth is imminent. PHYSICIANS and MIDWIVES work to deliver the baby. ANNE thinks, then.. 
ANNE Then don't acknowledge the child. 
HENRY is thrown.. 
HENRY What? 
With a blood-curdling scream, MARY finally gives birth. SIR THOMAS and NORFOLK crowd into the room, anxious to see.. 
PHYSICIAN A boy! 
SIR THOMAS turns towards HENRY, beaming with happiness.. 
SIR THOMAS It's a boy, your Majesty. A strong, healthy boy. 
HENRY's face: a boy? His eyes fill with emotion. This is what he has waited for. A son. 
ANNE notices his conflict, and prompts him again.. 
ANNE What my sister has given you, I could, too. 
HENRY looks at the BABY, then turns to face ANNE. His eyes are full of conflict, then..he silently nods. 
ANNE's face breaks out in a smile.. 
ANNE Very well. 
Then, in front of everyone, not caring how inappropriate it is, HENRY falls to his knee, takes ANNE's hand and kisses it. 
The audible sound of gasps. MARY watches in horror as HENRY falls to his knees and kisses ANNE's hand.. M MARY (a dagger in her heart) Henry..? 
HENRY gets to his feet, then turns and walks away without looking in the direction of MARY or the BABY. 
MARY (cont'd) My Lord..? 
MARY stares after the KING, but he does not turn around.

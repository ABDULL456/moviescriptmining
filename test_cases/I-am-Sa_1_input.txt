Muffled laughter from her colleagues. 
RITA You think I don't pro-bono?..I can do pro-bono.. I can do Goddamn pro-bono.. where the hell are my keys..hold the door! 
Rita runs to the open elevator and comes face to face with Sam who's been holding the door open for her. 
INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS 
The door closes.  Rita is trapped with Sam.  She stares forward trying to will him not there.  Rita gulps her champagne. 
SAM 32nd floor.  32 floors more.  31st floor.  31 floors more... 
And on and on and on.  Rita is about to spontaneously combust.  Finally, "G" - Rita bolts out the elevator doors, then just as suddenly turns around. 
RITA Alright, alright I'll take you. Alright, Goddammitt, I'll take you. 
SAM Oh my God oh my God!  Rubel Bly Harrison and Williams! 
Sam, shaking with relief, pulls out his wallet just as the elevator door starts closing. 
RITA No, no  no.  Pro-bono.  Alright?  Pro bono. 
The doors close.  We hear from within, as Sam goes up again: 
SAM (O.S.) Yes!  Alright!  I liked Sonny Bono too! 
INT. BUS - MORNING 
Sam stares out the window at an unfamiliar neighborhood.  On his lap, the pink box, now ripped, allowing us to see Lucy's birthday cake.  It's lopsided from having been thawed and refrozen. 
EXT. BUS STOP - NOON 
Sam waits for his transfer.  He sets the cake down on the bench and takes out a piece of paper with directions written on it.  The number 43 bus pull sup and Sam consults his paper once more before jumping on, forgetting the cake. 
The bus goes half a block before it SCREECHES to a halt.  Sam jumps off and runs back for the cake, but the bus continues on its way.  Moments later, the NUMBER 34 bus pulls up. Flustered and worried about being late, Sam jumps on.  He feels something cold on his hand, looks down, the box is starting to leak ice cream. 
INT. SOCIAL WORKERS OFFICE - DAY 
Lucy, Margaret, a therapist and a child psychologist wait for Sam. 
MARGARET BROWN Lucy, I'm sorry.  But it doesn't look like he's going to make it. 
LUCY (staring forward) He'll be here.  You smell like soap. 
MARGARET BROWN Lucy, he's an hour and 45 minutes late. You'll only have a few minutes left. 
Suddenly through the door comes Sam CARRYING THE MELTED, DRIPPING birthday cake.  Lucy runs to him. 
LUCY Daddy!  I told you I told you! 
CUT TO: 
INT. THE SOCIAL WORKER'S SMALL GREY OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 
Margaret, the therapist (Ms. Geller), and the Child Pscyhologist all write voraciously into note pads as they observe Sam and Lucy who sit in the center of the room, nervous under their scrutiny. 
SAM ...and she's a Century City lawyer - a very famous lawyer.  Guess what her name is?  Rita Harrison. 
LUCY (jaw drops) Lovely Rita Meter Maid. 
SAM Harrison.  Just like George. 
They move to hug each other.  EVERYONE REACHES for their pens.  Sam pulls back self-consciously.  Everyone writes even harder. 
SAM (CONT'D) You've grown. 
LUCY Have I? 
SAM Your ears are larger.  And your eyes are older. 
He's right.  Her eyes are older.  He hugs her - ALL THE PENS GO UP. 
SAM (CONT'D) I'm gonna get a phone machine.  Next paycheck.  If I'm not home, you can leave a message.  "Hi, This is Lucy." 
LUCY You can't afford a phone machine. 
The writing starts again.

FATHER JANOVICH I'm going over to that house today, Mr. Kowalski. 
WALT Is that so? 
FATHER JANOVICH It is. And every other day until you see the folly in what you are planning. 
WALT I gotta go, Padre. Busy day ahead. 
FATHER JANOVICH Go in peace. 
WALT I am at peace. Walt and Father Janovich shake hands. Walt exits. Father Janovich exhales loudly and drops into his chair. 
FATHER JANOVICH Je -- zuz -- Christ. 
INT. WALT'S KITCHEN - 3:51 P.M. 
Walt carefully reassembles the two weapons he just cleaned and oiled. Tao comes in and looks down at the two weapons -- The 30-06 M1 GARAND RIFLE and the COLT .45 PISTOL. Tao picks up the heavy RIFLE. 
TAO Which one do I get? 
WALT You ever fire a weapon?

TAO No. Tao aims the rifle at an imaginary target. 
WALT Put that down. I got something for you. 
TAO What? 
WALT In Korea, October, 1952. We were sent up to sweep a Chink machine gun nest that had carved us up pretty bad. I was the only one who came back... I received the Silver Star. I want you to have it. 
TAO Why? 
WALT When we went up that hill, we knew it was ten to one against us, but we went anyway. This trouble now, it's similar. We're walking right into it. We might not be coming home tonight. 
TAO The hell we won't. We're going to roll in there and tear ass. 
WALT Don't be a fool, these guys are waiting for that exact reaction. Tao is quiet for a minute. 
TAO How many? 
WALT How many what? 
TAO How many men did you kill in Korea? 
WALT Thirteen for sure. Probably more.

TAO What was it like to kill a man? 
WALT You don't want to know. 
TAO Why not? 
WALT Go get the Silver Star. It's in a blue wooden box in the cellar. Tao goes downstairs. He turns on the light and goes into the cellar. Tao locates a BLUE WOODEN BOX and opens it. Tao holds up the MEDAL. He looks at it closely. AND WHAM -- Walt slams the heavy cellar DOOR shut behind him. Walt slides the BOLT LOCK into place with a loud 
CLICK. Tao couldn't kick his way out of there in ten years. Of course he tries anyway. Tao is furious. He throws things. 
TAO What the hell are you doing?! Let me out of here, you goddamned son- of-a-bitch!! 
WALT Quit smashing everything. You'll never get out of there, so just relax. 
TAO You let me out, you crazy old fuck, or I will kill you when I get out of here. Tao pounds on the door. Walt pounds back with a strength and authority which startles Tao. 
WALT You want to know how it feels to kill a man? It feels goddamned lousy. And it feels even worse when you get a medal for bravery right after you mowed down some scared kid when he tries to give up. A dumb, scared, little gook, just about your age. I shot him with the same rifle you just held upstairs.

Jenny and the STAR MAN are following the tracks to an abandoned boxcar. 
INT. BOXCAR - DUSK 
The STAR MAN climbs in and pulls Jenny after him. Jenny is shivering badly. 
JENNY Can you close the door? 
The STAR MAN scrapes it forward. He activates the satel compass which lights the interior of the boxcar. While he is doing this Jenny turns her back to him and takes off her jacket. Her teeth chattering, she tries to wring the water out of it. 
STAR MAN You are cold. 
JENNY You're damn right I am. 
STAR MAN I do not get cold. 
Clutching the windbreaker to her breasts, Jenny looks at the STAR MAN over her shoulder. It doesn't take her long to make up her mind. 
JENNY (crossing to him) Open your shirt. 
She waits while he struggles with the buttons. After two she brushes away his hands and undoes the rest. She lets the windbreaker drop and, slipping her arms around his waist, presses her bare chest against his. 
JENNY (savoring it) Oh, you're warm... put your arms around me. 
The STAR MAN does and Jenny jumps as the wet sleeves touch her back. 
JENNY Take your shirt off. 
It is difficult with Jenny around his waist, but he manages. He drapes his arms over her. She snuggles into him. The RAIN POUNDS ON THE ROOF. Gradually, Jenny responds to the STAR MAN's warmth and relaxes. She lifts her head off his chest and looks at him. 
STAR MAN What? 
JENNY Nothing. 
She brushes her lips against his. The STAR MAN's not sure what's happening. But he's not offended. Her next kiss is full and long. He accepts it with his eyes open and when she eases back he leans in for more. Jenny responds. As if on command, the satel compass comes from around behind the STAR MAN to hover in back of Jenny. He takes it between his palms and extinguishes it. 
INT. BOXCAR - MORNING 
Jenny awakens and looks around. The STAR MAN is not with her. As she stands up she hears his VOICE OUTSIDE. He is speaking to something in his language. 
She goes to the door to find out what and sees him standing beside a fenced-in pasture talking to the horses inside. 
EXT. PASTURE - MORNING 
Jenny joins the STAR MAN at the fence. 
JENNY Good morning. 
STAR MAN Horses. 
JENNY You don't forget anything, do you? 
STAR MAN No. 
Jenny pets one of the horses on the nose. 
JENNY (to the horse) Hello... hello. How are you this morning? 
STAR MAN Do they talk?! 
JENNY (laughs) No, they don't talk... We talk to them. 
STAR MAN I understand. 
An appaloosa nudges her way through the others to the fence. 
JENNY Oh, you're pretty... 
STAR MAN I gave you a baby last night. 
Shocked, Jenny looks at him from around the appaloosa's nose. The STAR MAN is combing a horse's mane with his fingers and he doesn't see her expression. 
STAR MAN (meaning the horses) They are beautiful. 
JENNY Yes, they are. 
STAR MAN You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn. (turns to face her) You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one. 
JENNY (shakes her head 'no') But... 
STAR MAN It will be human and it will look like this. (touches his face) But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have. 
JENNY I told you it's impossible for me to have a baby. 
STAR MAN You will have this baby. If you want it. If you don't, I can stop it now. 
Jenny comes over and puts her arms around the STAR MAN. 
JENNY I want it.

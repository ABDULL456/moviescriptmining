The thin soldier smiles. That's the ticket. Bond hands out shoes to the rest of the guys. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. TEST FACILITY - KAZAKHSTAN - DAWN 
A red dawn.  Dominating the landscape, a valley of weirdly- shaped rocks. To one side, an airstrip.  The plane approaching. 
INT. PLANE - LANDING 
The three soldiers wear their new shoes and smoke and chat amongst themselves. 
Bond sits in the rear of the plane, which is dominated by heavily buffered receptacles, clearly awaiting some deadly cargo. There is Russian writing everywhere, and one symbol he clearly recognizes:  DANGER - RADIOACTIVE. 
Bond looks out of the window.  Beneath a huge MESA, a huddle of low buildings. 
They come to a stop near the end of the runway.  A SMALL JEEP is driving out to them. 
One of the soldiers throws something to Bond. An ORANGE JUMPSUIT that says Miratom on the breast.  He catches it. 
PILOT (subtitles) You have fifteen minutes. 
EXT. AIRSTRIP/VALLEY/TEST FACILITY - KAZAKHSTAN - DAWN 
Bond, in the orange overalls and wearing his ID tag, is driving with a Russian soldier through the weird rock valley - 
KABOOM! 
A cloud of dust from a detonation rises up on the other side of the hill. 
EXT. TEST FACILITY - KAZAKHSTAN - DAY 
They turn the corner and see trucks marked IDA, several Kazakhstan army personal carriers, soldiers dotted around, IDA (International Decommissioning Agency) scientists and personnel quietly going about their business.  A vast protective 'bubble' is inflated at the front of the building. 
INT. 'BUBBLE' - TEST FACILITY - KAZAKHSTAN - DAY (CHRISTMAS JONES') POV: 
The sound of breathing LOUD, we're looking from inside the visor of a protective suit.  It's hard to tell what's going on, but our hands are removing a sphere of cobalt blue plutonium from inside a corroding WARHEAD... 
EXT. FACILITY - SAME 
An officer eyes Bond's pass. 
COLONEL AKAKIEVICH (subtitles) You are late. The transport documents? 
Bond shows him the case.  Akakievich examines the documents. 
COLONEL AKAKIEVICH (subtitles) They are waiting for you below.  It should be ready. Check with the IDA physicist. 
He points toward the "bubble." 
Inside the transparent bubble, a protective-suited FIGURE finishes placing a blue PLUTONIUM CORE into a box. 
As Bond and the Colonel walks toward the bubble, the FIGURE steps out, still enveloped in the white protective suit. 
Moving fast, off comes the helmet to reveal a BEAUTIFUL AMERICAN GIRL.  CHRISTMAS JONES is mid-twenties, shortish hair, hot right now.  In one movement she unzips and steps out of the suit, revealing a khaki sports bra, cut-off shorts, heavy duty boots.  A nasty-looking hunting knife strapped around her hips.  She has a deep tan and an incredible figure. 
She grabs a bottle of water, guzzles. 
Bond tosses an arched brow to Akakievich, who nods bitterly, also unable to take his eyes off her.  He spits on the floor and speaks in ENGLISH, so Christmas can hear. 
COLONEL AKAKIEVICH Not interested in men. Take my word for it. 
Akakievich isn't exactly what you'd call a looker.  Bond offers a disappointed tut as Akakievich walks away. 
Christmas approaches.  He notices her IDA tag -- and an incongruous PEACE TATTOO just above her hip. She's checking him out as well. 
CHRISTMAS You new? 
BOND (Russian accent) Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...? 
CHRISTMAS Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, I've heard them all. 
BOND Don't know any doctor jokes. 
She is wary.  It's been a long time since a man this attractive stepped onto her beat. They walk toward the building. 
CHRISTMAS What happened to Len Tashka? 
BOND Couldn't make it. Splitting headache. 
CHRISTMAS The soldiers may give you a hard time. Whatever. If we weren't around, they'd have their whole nuclear arsenal lying by the roadsides, rotting in the sun. 
Bond looks at the ominous radiation WARNING SIGNS. 
BOND Will I need protection? 
She squints at him, taken aback. 
CHRISTMAS There's no radiation danger down there. 
Bond turns to go, knowing he misstepped.  Christmas then speaks to him, asking a question, IN RUSSIAN. 
CHRISTMAS (subtitles) Where is this stockpile going? 
Bond turns, answers IN PERFECT RUSSIAN. 
BOND (subtitles) To the nuclear facility at Penza 19. 
She nods. Watches him disappear into the building.

CHUCK What the fuck are you doing? 
His deepest instinct was to survive.  And that is what he is going to do. 
CHUCK Hang on.  Just hang on. 
Slowly he pulls himself back from the edge. 
EXT.  BEACH - LATER 
Chuck walks aimlessly down the beach, feeling the burden of starting over.  The beach is littered with seaweed and flotsam, bits of rope, plastic bottles.  He picks up a plastic bottle.  That will come in handy. 
The Chuck sees a SOCCER BALL with "Wilson" stamped on it in big black letters. 
He picks it up, holds it, tosses it up in the air.  Then he kicks it, then kicks it again, then runs down the beach, trying to kick it and keep it out of the water.  Feeling joy again, even here. 
INT.  CAVE - THAT DAY 
The sun is setting on his darkened cave.  The soccer ball sits in the corner by the black cold ashes of what was once his fire. 
Chuck carves a bit of coconut meat, takes a bite and winces as the meat hits his sore tooth.  He tosses the shell on a small new pile of shells. 
Chuck shakes out the last half Tylenol tablet.  He puts the tablet in his mouth, then takes a sip out of his coconut canteen.  When the water hits his tooth that hurts too. 
INT.  CAVE - MORNING 
Chuck mixes a mash of breadfruit and coconut.  He tries to pack the tooth with the mash, but it's so sensitive that even this hurts.  He pounds the floor of the cave in frustration. 
INT.  CAVE - LATER 
Chuck holds a stone chisel and his hammer stone.  He positions the chisel against his inflamed tooth.  But the thought of what he is about to do is too frightening.  He lowers the chisel. 
CHUCK Shit.  Shit.  Shit. 
EXT.  BEACH - DAY 
Chuck tries to fill his mouth with sea water.  The pain is so great his eyes water. 
CHUCK Whoo, pig.  Sooey! 
He falls back in the water and floats there, looking up at the sky. 
INT.  CAVE - LATER 
Determined, Chuck hold the stone chisel again.  He raises it slowly to his mouth and picks up the hammer stone. 
CHUCK No pain, no gain. 
He brings the hammer down hard on the chisel!  The screen goes BLACK as Chuck's SCREAM continues UNDER. 
FADE IN: 
EXT.  OCEAN - SUNRISE - THREE YEARS LATER 
The sky takes on the first colors of the day.  The ocean is still dark, but a few waves catch the first light.  The sunrise touches the summit, moves down the cliff, then lights the cove.  On the screen superimpose: 
"1000 DAYS LATER" 
REFLECTION - WATER 
A spear shimmers in the calm morning water.  Attached to the spear is a man, standing completely still. 
ON CHUCK 
We move up out of the reflection to the real man.  His legs are scarred.  The remnants of a dress wrap around his middle. A stone knife on a neatly mounted haft is stuck in a belt made of videotape and woven fiber.  Necklaces of shark's teeth and shells hang from his neck.  His hair is long.  A coconut frond hat is on his head. 
The hand wrapped around the spear is scarred and brown as a berry.  It holds the spear perfectly still.  The watch is gone. 
We come around slowly until we see Chuck's face.  The eyes say it all.  They stare out with a survivor's intensity, staring at the water, unblinking.  This is the man who used to splash futilely about in the water trying to fish. 
This is the FedEx man who was plugged into the tumult of activity and energy, surrounded by technology and human activity at its most intense, devoted to making seconds count.  Now he is utterly alone, and utterly still. 
And now he has all the time in the world. 
Suddenly, without an once of wasted motion, he shoots the spear forward at a low angle.  It quivers, stuck on the bottom.  He pulls it out with a practiced twist.  On the end is a struggling fish. 
But this isn't a thrill anymore.  It's another day at the office. 
EXT.  BEACH - LATER THAT DAY 
Chuck makes a mark on a palm tree.  He has completely covered three other trees with marks.  It sinks in how long he has been here. 
EXT.  JUNGLE - LATER 
Chuck carries the fish back from the beach.  Now there is a well-worn trail. 
INT.  CAVE - THAT AFTERNOON 
Chuck enters with the fish.  We are greeted with the well- ordered lair of a primitive stone-age man. 
Clam shell spirals weave in and out around the fire hole. Strips of eel jerky and fish hang drying from racks. 
Tools are lined up neatly:  digging sticks, stone hammers and saws, spears neatly hafted onto shafts, drills, awls.  Bits and pieces of feathers, skins, bones, rags, leaves -- are all neatly arranged.  Strings and cords hang from hooks.  Coconut bowls and cooking rocks form a small kitchen.  A raincoat and rain-hat woven of palm fronds is neatly draped over a frame. 
Evocative pieces of driftwood decorate the room.  A wind chime of obsidian flakes sways gently.  The watch hangs on a stick. 
The Angel Box has the place of honor on one side.  On the other side the Wilson soccer ball rests on a throne of rocks. Seaweed has been placed on the ball as hair.  Clam shells have been stuck on for eyes, other shells form a mouth.  A tube shell and conch form a pipe. 
INT.  CAVE - FIRE - NIGHT 
The fish are being smoke under a palm frond.  Eel skins hang from sticks, roasting.  Chuck sits by the fire, hafting a stone knife onto a wooden haft. 
He ties some fiber to a stick, then braids it into string, using both hands and his mouth for the three strands.

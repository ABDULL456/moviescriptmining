AARON (about to break) You were late. 
MARY I was held up... 
AARON The asshole peed on me. I'm dog shit. 
MARY .at the bank. Honey, were they the same ones? Don't cry. 
AARON Get a grip, mom. They arrive home, both storming through the entrance and up the stairs. 
EXT. APARTMENT - DAY 
The door SLAMS to signify arrival. School books go flying. Mother and son march down the hallway. They are greeted by Horus, sleep still on his face. 
HORUS How was your day? Mother and son - if eyes could disembowel. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BUILDING - DAY 
Just your average professional building, several stories of brick and cement. 
But all is not well with this typically normal picture. On the top floor, outside and on the ledge - a JUMPER stands poised before blood and concrete. His TIE flaps in the wind. From an adjacent window, a SECRETARY, a FIREMAN attempt to get him down. 
JUMPER' 
(SELF-PITY) People ignore me. From his vantage - a congregation of PEOPLE swarm below in his honor. A woman cradling a BABY watches from a building window across the street. 
FIREMAN Mr. Fisher. 
SECRETARY (through her teeth) You're not unattractive. 
FIREMAN Baldness is not fatal. 
JUMPER My wife ignores me. 
FIREMAN Your wife's a cunt, Mr. Fisher. 
SECRETARY We like you, Mr. Fisher. The girls acknowledge you, we all do. 
JUMPER No. 
SECRETARY Yes. 
JUMPER Really? The secretary SCREAMS. All attention shifts to the BUILDING across the street. The secretary points... 
EXT. OPPOSITE BUILDING - DAY 
There... 
on the top floor, outside and on the ledge - the baby seen earlier, diaper-clad, crawls precariously on the rim of doom. His mother's FREAKING from the window. Below, the crowd makes its way across the street. They point and gasp at the infant's every movement - leaving the jumper by his lonesome. The baby teeters along the edge. It heads for a FLAG pole, dazzled by the red-white-and-blue. It reaches out at fabric. Almost. Not quite. The baby DROPS from the precipice. On the street, people CHOKE on their tongues as gravity pulls the infant down. But wait... Hancock swoops out of the thin blue, swift and silent. He cradles the baby from utter concrete. He deposits the youngster with.the ecstatic crowd - they, of mostly the FEMALE persuasion, all form around the savior. We SEE in the background and across the street, the Jumper nose- diving into the sidewalk - without much fanfare. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
An apartment building engulfed in FLAMES. FIRE TRUCKS don't even bother with the hoses - it's too late. Around them, TENANTS bemoan the loss of... Like a wrecking ball, Hancock BURSTS through the burning rubble and surfaces clean on the other side of the building. Blanketed under his cape are two little TODDLERS, and a young WOMAN in bra and panties. He lowers them to safety. 
CUT TO: 
INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT 
We're in the hallway. Where Horus kneels. He's bent listening into Aaron's bedroom, in his security clothes. By the TV and in her apron, Mary watches the news... 
NEWS . paramedics have taken the rescued tenants to County General for smoke inhalation but no serious injuries reported thanks to the superheroics of this mystery man... 
We see FOOTAGE of the dramatic fire rescue: Hancock recovering tenants from the pyre - plebs and dwellers cheer in exaggerated astonishment. 
HORUS (to Mary) Mary? Mary blinks back her attention.

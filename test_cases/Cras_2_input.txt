At first she fails to recognize him. Her firm eyes cut across him to Catherine's elegant figure, as if suspicious of her cross-legged posture. 
James gets out of the car and approaches Vera. He points to the suitcases in the rear seat of Vera's car. 
JAMES Are you leaving, Vera? Listen, I'm trying to find Vaughan. 
Vera finishes with the girl and, still staring at Catherine, steps into her car. 
VERA The police are after him. An American serviceman was killed on the Northolt overpass. 
James puts his hand on the windshield, but she switches on the windshield wipers, almost cutting the knuckle of his wrist. 
VERA I was with him in the car at the time. 
Before James can stop her, she accelerates toward the exit and turns into the fast evening traffic. 
James gets back into Catherine's car. 
JAMES I think he'll be waiting for us at the airport. 
CATHERINE James... 
James turns the car into the traffic. 
EXT. AIRPORT ROADWAYS -- NIGHT 
Vaughan is waiting for them at the airport flyover. He makes no attempt to hide himself, pushing his heavy car into the passing traffic stream. 
Apparently uninterested in them, Vaughan lies against his door sill, almost asleep at the wheel as he surges forward when the lights change. His left hand drums across the rim of the steering wheel as he swerves the Lincoln to and fro across the road surface. 
His face is fixed in a rigid mask as he cuts in and out of the traffic lanes, surging ahead in the fast lane until he is abreast of them and then sliding back behind them, allowing other cars to cut between them and then taking up a watchful position in the slow lane. 
James can see that Vaughan's car has become even more battered than it was before, scarred with many impact points, a rear window broken, cracked headlamps, a body panel detached from the off-side rear wheel housing, the front bumper hanging from the chassis pinion, its rusting lower curvature touching the ground as Vaughan corners. 
When they slow down for a line of tankers, Vaughan makes his move. He pulls up beside them and then cuts viciously across three lanes of traffic to hit them broadside. The nose of the Lincoln just nicks the tail of the light sports car, which spins down the road.

He positions himself to try and jump off.     Parker grabs his arm. 
PARKER No, no, no. Please don't jump down there, Dan. You'll get hurt. 
LYNCH How are you going to find your way in the dark? 
DAN I'll stick to the trail. I'll ride to the bottom. 
X (then) You don't get a fresher run than this, right? 
Dan drops his snowboard down. 
R It lands sticking up straight in the snow. 
DAN (cont'd) OK. 
A Parker and Lynch look back at him.      They don't know what to say. 
Lynch tries to grab on to Dan's arm. 
M LYNCH Walker, no. 
Dan shrugs free.    He is determined.    Concentrating. 
DAN One. 
D Parker's tears are freezing on her cheeks as the seconds tick by. 
DAN (cont'd) ...Two. 
E Lynch takes a deep breath. When enough time has elapsed to think Dan's gonna jump, he suddenly looks up at Lynch instead of jumping. 
DAN (cont'd) Remember when I was saying how I jumped off one of these things before? 
Lynch stares back at him. 
DAN (cont'd) I totally lied. I'm scared shitless right now. 
Lynch musters a laugh.      It's forced, but it's a laugh. 
Dan laughs back at him. He turns to face Parker.    She tries to smile but is frozen with fear. 
Dan whispers to her... 
DAN (cont'd) (whispered) 
X You're gonna be OK, baby. 
...and he is gone. 
From his point of view (the camera pointed down at his feet) 
R we drop (without cutting) from the chair all the way to the frozen ground below. 
CUT TO: 
A 39   EXT. BELOW THE CHAIR - CONTINUOUS                             39 CRACK! Both of Dan's legs shatter from the impact. Viscera protrudes out of his snow pants as his leg bones shoot out the top of his knees. 
M DAN AHHH!!     OH MY GOD!   AHHHH!!!! 
CUT TO: 
40   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS                                  40 
D Parker calls down to him. 
PARKER DAN!   DANNY? Oh my god! 
E Dan's cries turn to quiet breaths below them. It is tough for Parker and Lynch to make out what exactly is happening. 
LYNCH Dan, say something.     Are you alright? 
More quiet breaths from below. 
Finally... 
DAN (O.C.) My legs.    I broke my fucking legs. 
LYNCH Oh, shit. 
PARKER Can you move? Dan? (she starts to panic) Hold on. Hold on, baby. 
Lynch stops her. 
X LYNCH What are you doing? 
PARKER I gotta...I have to get to him.

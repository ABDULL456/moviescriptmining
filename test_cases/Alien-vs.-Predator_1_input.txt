KAMEN 'We'?  You wanna fly out there with me? 
HIROKO Sure.  Do me good to stretch my legs. 
HIROKO takes a sip of her drink, her brow furrowing. 
HIROKO (CONT'D) This whole thing's got me spooked. 
KAMEN hops off the wheel. 
KAMEN Don't worry about it.  If the Network goes by the book, like everyone figures they will, a Marine gunboat from Powell'll drop-by for a look- see in four-or-five days.  They can go poke around out there and find whatever it was hit us.  All we've gotta do is sit tight. 
HIROKO Do you think Ackland'll sit tight? 
KAMEN There'd have to be a helluva good reason for him not to. 
EXT.  SPACE 
A peculiar blue scanning beam plays over the rotating mass of the incapacitated satellite, examining every section.  it comes to the rent torn through it, and pauses. 
FROM THE SCANNER'S P.O.V., we see the structure of the satellite made up from a series of blue geodesic shapes.  The damage registers as a cold, black mass. 
The beam switches off and the hovering PREDATOR shuttle turns smoothly on it's axis, thrusting towards the planet. 
EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - IMPACT SITE - NIGHT 
Shafts of torch-light fan out above the thick foliage in the darkness. YORK and ACKLAND wade through the chin-high reeds, cursing. 
ACKLAND Found anything? 
YORK looks down at his data-stick, a handheld torch with a multi- purpose readout screen. 
YORK Nada. No radiation... no movement... nothing. 
ACKLAND Well, just keep looking.  It's gotta be... whoa, Jesus! 
ACKLAND falls toward onto something, and YORK comes running. 
YORK What is it? 
ACKLAND steadies himself, and the two men shine their torches at the rhythmically-breathing SHAPE on the ground. 
ACKLAND It's a rhino. 
YORK Is it dead? 
ACKLAND No, it's still breathing.  Kinda clammy though.  Are you sure your stick's not broken. 
YORK looks at the data-stick again. 
YORK Yeah, it's fine. 
ACKLAND God, I hope that thing didn't bring down a virus. 
YORK I told you we... what's that? 
Their torch beams PAN ACROSS a three-foot high ovular shape. 
ACKLAND Looks like a spore.  Fungus of some kind, maybe? 
YORK Bloody big if it is.  Top's open. 
ACKLAND steps cautiously forward to shine his torch inside. 
YORK (CONT'D) Careful... 
There's nothing inside.  ACKLAND looks disappointed. 
ACKLAND It's hollow.  Think our rhino must've ate something that didn't agree with him. 
A heavy gust of air blows unexpectedly across the clearing with a BANSHEE HOWL, ruffling their hair. 
YORK Let's get back and call this in. 
ACKLAND Wait a minute. 
YORK reluctantly follows ACKLAND as he thrashes through the thinn ing foliage, coming out at the rim of the impact crater.  It's beginning to partially collapse, water seeping in.  YORK runs his beam over something at the bottom of the shallow pit. 
YORK What is that... is that metal fragments? 
ACKLAND's maybe getting a little nervous now.

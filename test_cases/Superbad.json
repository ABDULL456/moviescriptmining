{"train": "There are 30 guys standing behind the starting line of the school's track. We hear a TEACHER yell \"Go!\" and the boys start running. \nWe FOLLOW them from above. All the boys keep pretty much the same pace except for one runner who slowly lags behind. The group gets so far ahead of the him that he is alone in the frame. He stops. \nCLOSE UP OF THE RUNNER: \nKneeling on the track breathing heavily. It's Seth. \nSETH (panting) This...is...bullshit. \nA moment later a KID with prosthetic leg jogs by. \nKID (as he passes Seth) Poo-say. \nINT. CLARK SECONDARY CLASSROOM - DAY \nEvan is sitting in math class staring at HELEN'S breasts. She`s a very tall girl and is athletic in a sexy way, wearing volleyball team sweat pants and a tank top. He looks up from her breasts to her face: she is staring right at him. He immediately looks to the front of the class, embarrassed. \nThe bell rings and everyone leaves. Helen walks up to Evan as they enter the hallway. He's really nervous. She offers him a pen. \nHELEN Hey Evan, thanks for the pen. \nEVAN Oh, don't worry, no worries. Just keep it. Then you'll just have it, and you won't have to borrow another pen. \nHELEN Thanks...uh...I was going to ask you, did you hear about Terry's grad party? It's going to be so insane. \nEVAN Yeah, it's a maybe. But, you know, I gotta, I got my...

But I, like, never see you at any parties or anything. \nEVAN Because of all the other fun shit I'm off doing. \nHELEN (playful) Okay. So why weren't you at Dimitri's party on Saturday? \nEVAN Dimitri's? I uh...didn't want to go, because, well, I did other stuff. Saturday... (nervous, he desperately thinks) Oh yeah! Saturday night was awesome! \n(The real version of Evan's story is shown through a montage of quick flashbacks.) \nEVAN (CONT'D) (V.O) First my parents went out to a double feature, so a bunch of people came over... \nINT. EVAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nSeth is there. Evan and him are surfing the Bang Bus web site. FOGELL arrives with a bottle of Sambuca. Fogell is one of those seniors who looks like he's thirteen years old. \nEVAN ...and we had a couple drinks in my basement... \nAn empty bottle of Sambuca in front of them and empty beer cans at their feet, the three boys each shotgun a beer. \nEVAN (CONT'D) (V.O) ...and Seth's parents were having this cocktail party, and we went over there to, like, mingle... \nINT SETH'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nSeth's parents are having a fancy cocktail party. The boys are drunk as hell. \nEVAN ...and there were actually some really interesting and, like, entertaining people there... \nThe boys laugh hysterically as they each shake Tobassco Sauce onto their tongues. They writhe around in agony as several adults look at them like they are morons. \nEVAN (CONT'D) (V.O.) ...and, uh, then we saw some, uh, live music. \nINT. SETH'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT \nIn Seth's basement, the boys violently wrestle. Evan gives Fogell a bloody nose, but they all can't help but laugh. \nEVAN ...then we went to a club downtown... \nEXT.

She's havin' a fuckin' party. \nANGLE ON: Fogell entering the room \nSETH (CONT'D) (whispering) Don't tell Fogell about the party. \nFOGELL Hey guys, I was walking here, and on the way, I saw Nicola, and she was wearing these tight white pants and a black g- string and you could see it right through the pants. \nINT. HALLWAY (FLASHBACK) - EARLIER \nWe see Fogell, looking at the ass of NICOLA, an incredibly hot girl who exudes sexual vibes and looks a little skanky; you can see her black g-string through her tight white pants. She turns and notices Fogell. He gives an awkward look. \nFOGELL It's nine thirty. \nNICOLA What? \nINT. FOODS AND NUITRITION ROOM (PRESENT) - CONTINUOUS \nBack to Fogell, Seth and Evan. \nFOGELL I told her what time it was. It was awesome. She's got the nicest ass. \nSETH Like you'd know what to do with it. \nFOGELL Ha ha. I'm really gonna miss your knee- slappers when me and Evan are at State. \nSETH (pissed) Yeah, well I'll be at Junior college where the girls are half as smart, and thus twice as likely to blow me. \nFOGELL What are you guys doing tonight? \n(CONTINUED) 18   CONTINUED:                                                        18 \nSETH Nothing. Sorry. You'll just have to fingerbang yourself. \nEVAN (to Fogell) What you doing? \nFOGELL Well, Seth always said I was too much of a pussy, but he was wrong. It's been arranged. At lunch, I'm going to the same place Mike Snider went to pick up my brand new false identification card. \nSETH Dude! That's perfect, `cause, Evan, didn't you just say that you heard about a party? \nFOGELL (to Evan) Why didn't you tell me? \nSETH Shut up. Who cares? Just be happy he told. And hey! Now you can buy the booze. \nFOGELL Sounds cool. Cool. \nMRS. GREIR (O.S.) If you're not in this class, leave this class! \nEVAN Well done, man. We'll see you after class. \nFogell leaves. \nSETH Did you tell that nimrod you're not going to room with him? \nEVAN Uh...no, not yet. \nSETH You better, man.

What's the hold up? \nSETH We're getting a fake ID. \nJULES Well, you two have four more years to cuddle, so let's get to work. \nEVAN Actually, we're going to different schools. \nJULES Really? You're cutting the cord? What's going to happen? \nSETH Nothing! Jesus. \nEVAN Yeah? What do people think is gonna happen? That's what I don't get. \nSETH We're not, like, dependent on each other. \nEVAN We met when we were 8, we were fine before then. It's not like we do everything together. \nINT. CLARK SECONDARY CAFETERIA - DAY \nSeth and Evan are eating together. \nEVAN So it looks like we get a little graduation party after all. \nSETH I would do terrible things to get with Jules tonight. Terrible things. \nEVAN No shit. I'd give my left foot to start dating Helen. She's killin' me. \n(CONTINUED) 30   CONTINUED:                                                        30 \nSETH Hey. Here I am. \nJULES So you're coming to my party, right? It's fully on. \nSETH Yeah. Why? Should I not? \nJULES No, no, no. I really want you to come. But...uh, you did say you were getting a fake ID or something, is that right? \nSETH Very right. Right. I'm getting that. \nSHIRLEY Can you get us drinks? \nSETH Ummm... I don't know. I... think...maybe. \nJULES (half joking) Come on, you scratch our backs, we'll scratch yours. \nSETH Well, funny thing about my back. It's located on my cock. \nShirley is offended. Jules laughs a little. Seth laughs too hard. \nSETH (CONT'D) Ha! Alright, sure. I can do that. What do you guys want? \nJULES Well, this is actually, like, a big favor, but, well, my parents gave me like a hundred bucks to feed myself for the week, but the house if full of food, so I figure I should just spend all of it on extra drinks for the party. \nSETH Wow. I would never even think of doing something that nice. \nJules hands Seth a hundred dollars. \n(CONTINUED) 30   CONTINUED: (2)                                                 30 \nJULES Well, this is really nice of you. I mean, I really appreciate this. \nSeth can't believe what he's hearing. He can barely contain his smile. \nSETH Should I just get, like, a shitload of different shit? \nJULES Whatever shit you think people would like, I don't really know. \nSHIRLEY I want Mike's Hard Lemonade. \nJULES Okay. I'll see you tonight. \nSETH Yeah! I'll see you! \nThe girls walk off, leaving Seth lost in thought. He suddenly runs down the hall. \nEXT. SCHOOL FIELD - MOMENTS LATER \nEvan is standing alone amidst the rest of his gym class as they play soccer. \nGYM TEACHER Evan, get into the game. \nEvan says nothing and the teacher soon redirects his attention elsewhere. Evan sees Seth jogging towards him. \nSETH (out of breath, worked up) Man, just - Evan, listen to me. You know Jules? You know what she just did? She came up to me and asked me if I would buy her alcohol. Not just her, her whole party. Do you know what that means? It means that by some miracle, we were paired up, we talked, and she actually thought of me afterwards. Thought of me enough to decide that I was the guy that she was going to trust the fun-ness of her party with. She wants me! She fucking wants my dick! \n(CONTINUED) 31   CONTINUED:                                                       31 \nEVAN Did you ever think maybe she's just using you to get her alcohol? \nSETH Of course I thought of that! LISTEN TO THIS! \nINT. FOODS AND NUITRITION ROOM (FLASHBACK) \nThe same scene as before with Seth and Jules in class. \nJULES Yeah! My older brother always eats blue cheese. You know that stuff is actually moldy. \nEXT. SCHOOL FIELD - PRESENT \nSETH She has an older brother! She could have asked him, but she asked me! She looked me straight in the face and asked me. She wants to fuck me, man. Do you understand that? Fucking! Today is the day that fucking has become possible. \nEVAN Are you stupid? You're not going to be able to sleep with her tonight. \nSETH She's going to be at the party, she's gonna be drunk, and she likes me at least a little, so I can get with her. Then, I make her my girlfriend, and then I fuck her all summer long! Then, by the time college rolls around, I'm the fuckin' fucking master, man! \nEVAN Make her your girlfriend? Of course! That's good. So, hypnosis, love potion, or mind-control helmet? \nSETH Once I've gotten with her, I write her love letters, flowers, I'll do anything - I'll be the most pussy-whipped guy in the universe - what chick wouldn't go out with a guy like that? \n(CONTINUED) 33   CONTINUED:                                                       33 \nThe soccer ball rolls towards them. They both watch as it rolls by. \nCLASSMATE What the hell, Evan? \nEvan shrugs back. \nSETH Yeah! You almost gave me a goddamn heart attack! You better fucking have it, where is it? \nFOGELL I got it. It's flawless! It's great, man, look. \nFogell reaches into his pocket and pulls out the fake ID. Evan grabs it. \nEVAN (reading the card) Okay Mr...\"McLovin\"? What kind of a stupid name is that? What are you trying to be, an Irish R&B singer? \nFOGELL Well, they let you pick any name you want when you get there. \nSETH So you picked McLovin? \nFOGELL It was between that or Muhammad. \nSETH Why was it between that or Muhammad? Why didn't you just pick a common name? \nFOGELL Actually, Seth, Muhammad is the most commonly used name on earth. \nEVAN Have you ever actually met a guy named Muhammad? \nFOGELL Have you actually ever met a guy named McLovin? \nSETH No! That's why you picked a bad name. \n(CONTINUED) 37   CONTINUED: (2)                                                 37 \nEVAN You probably have federal agents tracking you for even considering the name Muhammad on a fake ID! \nSETH Look at this shit man, you don't even have a first name. It just says \"NAME: MCLOVIN\" \nEVAN One name? \nFOGELL I just thought McLovin sounded old, and the chicks would dig it. \nEVAN Under what circumstances would you ever have to show a chick your ID? \nFOGELL She could ask. Or, I could just show it to her. \nSETH Holy shit! I don't believe this. This says you're fucking 25! Why didn't you just put 21? \nFOGELL I knew you would ask that. Look, every day, dozens of kids roll into the liquor store with fake ID's trying to act like Joe Casual. Each and every one of these kids just so happens to be 21 years old. Just how many 21 year-olds do you think there are? \nSETH Fool! \nEVAN Calm down! It's not terrible! This might work, but it's up to you, Fogell. They'll either think, \"Oh, it's another punk kid with a fake ID.\" Or, \"Look, it's McLovin, the twenty five year-old organ donor\". What's it gonna be? \nFogell takes a deep breath. \n(CONTINUED) 37   CONTINUED: (3)                                                37 \nFOGELL I am McLovin. \nSETH You're not McLovin. No one's McLovin and this is never going to work. We need a new way to get alcohol. Could we drive to Canada or something? \nFOGELL I still think it's going to work. \nThey walk into the staff parking lot. Seth stops. \nSETH What the fuck? Where's my car? \nEVAN I told you, man! What did I say? I told you that was a dumb idea. \nFOGELL Why would you park in the staff- \nSETH Shut up, Fogell. \nFOGELL `Cause you're not staff. \nSETH I am aware of that, Fagell. \nSeth storms off. Evan follows him. \nFOGELL (yelling) Will you still pick me up from work? \nEvan and Seth round the corner, leaving Fogell behind. \nSETH Let's go to your house. \nINT. EVAN'S BEDROOM - SOON AFTER \nSeth puts on a shirt that is way too small and he's wearing pants that are too tight. Evan is playing the video game Grand Theft Auto. \n(CONTINUED) 38   CONTINUED:                                                        38 \nSETH Now we wait for your Mom to piss off and steal your parents' booze like your brother always does. Take a bit from every bottle. Piece of cake. It's not exactly what Jules wanted, but it'll do, right? \nEVAN Come on! Just wear what you wore to school. \nSETH I told you I can't do that. I can't let Jules see me in the same shit I wore at school. It's completely unbecoming. \nEXT. SHOPWELLS - DUSK \nEvan and Seth walk off the bus. They see Fogell walking towards them. He's in his uniform holding a hanger with a shirt and a vest. \nSETH What the hell is that? \nFOGELL A vest. \nSETH You're gonna look like a Pinocchio. \nEVAN What? It's just a vest. \nFOGELL Yeah. How many high schoolers you see in vests? \nSETH (eyeing Shopwell's) You know, they got a ton of liquor right in there. If we get it now we can get to the party faster with all of Jules' shit. \nFOGELL No way! I work there. They know I'm not twenty-five. \nSETH Nobody said anything about you, dick- mouth. You have one name on your ID. It's out of the equation!

No! Hell no! You can't do that! \nEVAN (mocking) Yeah, right! \nSETH That's right. And that way I give Jules back her money, like you did with Helen. That was good thinking, that's fucking pimp. That's how you seal a deal. It won't be hard. Remember Dan Vertlieb stole a keg from here and he's got, like, really bad scoliosis! \nEVAN You're not gonna steal it. Fogell, he's not going to steal it. \nFOGELL Please. Don't do this! I promise. I'll get the liquor later. \nSETH I'm stepping up. And once I'm up, I don't step back down. Maybe you \"State\" boys don't understand that. \nSeth walks to the store. \nINT. SHOPWELL'S - CONTINUOUS \nSeth enters the store, looking determined. He spots a SECURITY GUARD standing by one of the registers. \nSETH (to himself) Hope piggy can run. \nHe walks past the registers, which brings him in front of the long liquor aisle. He surveys the scene. There is an OLD WOMAN browsing the shelves. Seth looks over to the registers. \nINT. SHOPWELL'S (FANTASY) - EVENING \nSeth is at the cash register. He has a huge amount of booze in the conveyor belt. \nCASHIER How old are you? \n(CONTINUED) 44   CONTINUED:                                                      44 \nSETH Twenty two. \nCASHIER You certainly are. That'll be eighty dollars. \nSeth hands the cashier a big EIGHTY DOLLAR BILL. \nSETH Thank you kindly. \nCASHIER You're welcome, Seth. \nINT. SHOPWELL'S - CONTINUOUS \nSeth, still standing in front of the liquor aisle, shakes his head. He eyeballs the old lady. \nINT. SHOPWELL'S (FANTASY) - EVENING \nThe old lady is browsing. She drops her big purse. A hand reaches down and picks it up. It's Seth. \nSETH Excuse me, ma'am. You dropped your purse. Would you like me to help you to your car? \nOLD LADY That would be lovely, young man. Would you like me to buy you alcohol? \nSETH That would be lovely! \nEXT. SHOPWELL'S (FANTASY) - MOMENTS LATER \nSeth, holding two huge bags of liquor, waves to the Old Lady as she drives away. \nSETH Enjoy your remaining years! \nOLD LADY I will. Enjoy fucking Jules! \nINT. SHOPWELL'S (FANTASY) - CONTINUOUS \nSeth shakes his head.

How's that? If you don't buy the alcohol, I will kill you! \nFOGELL Killing me won't get you any alcohol, jerkoff! I'm the one with the ID! \nSETH Then I will kill you, cut off your ugly face, put it over mine, and buy it my fucking self. \nFOGELL You don't have the technology or the steady hands to pull off a procedure like that! \nSeth stands for a moment, then suddenly rushes Fogell. Evan stands between them and breaks it up. \nEVAN Seth, calm down! Fogell, stop being a baby and go buy the alcohol! You said you'd do it, so do it. It's why you bought the ID, so just go do it. \nFOGELL (beat) I'll try. \nFogell walks into the store. \nINT. LIQUOR STORE - CONTINUOUS \nAt first it all seems overwhelming. Fogell is confused, dizzy, and sweating. He steps behind a large beer display and takes a few deep breaths. \nCLERK Hi there. \nFogell flinches, shocked someone spoke to him. He keeps walking. He nears a mother and her 17 year old SON. As Fogell passes them, the son seems to recognize him. Fogell clearly recognizes the son. Their eyes meet. Fogell looks in the opposite direction. \nSON Fogell? \n(CONTINUED) 52   CONTINUED:                                                       52 \nFOGELL (weird voice, covering his face) No. \nSON Yo, Fogell. `Sup man. What're you doing here? \nFOGELL (weird voice) Uh...nothing. Not Fogell... (whisper) Shut up, Moscovitch. You don't know me. \nMOSCOVITCH (knowingly) Oh, oh. Cool, cool. Good luck. \nHe puts his head down and quickly walks away. He arrives at the beer and cooler section. Clearly intimidated, he slowly opens a beer fridge. He grabs one beer attached to a six-pack and pulls it forward. The beer comes loose in his hand as the other five fall to the ground, cracking on impact, and spraying beer all over the place. Fogell scrambles to stop the beers from spraying, but soon finds that it is impossible. \nFOGELL Fuck. \nA CLERK approaches Fogell. \nCLERK Is there a problem, sir? \nFOGELL Umm, nope, no problem whatsoever. \nCLERK (pointing to the beer on the floor) Sir, did you do this? On the floor? \nFOGELL (beat) No. (beat) I think it happened before. \nFogell is standing in a puddle of beer with beer sprayed all over his legs, holding a can of beer. \n(CONTINUED) 52   CONTINUED: (2)                                                 52 \nCLERK Are you sure? \nFOGELL I think I would know, thank you. \nFogell walks away. \nINT. LIQUOR STORE - LATER \nFogell has a shopping cart filled with booze. He gets in line to pay. He looks ahead to the OLD-LOOKING GUY (35) who is currently at the CASHIER (woman) paying. \nCASHIER Um, yes, may I please see some ID? \nOLD-LOOKING GUY No problem. Heh. I haven't been ID-ed in years. \nCASHIER Anyone who looks under thirty-five. \nThe guy looks through his wallet. Fogell nervously watches. \nEXT. LIQUOR STORE - CONTINUOUS \nSeth and Evan peek through one of the store's front windows. \nSETH It's a good ID, right? Mike Snider never had a problem. It's fine. Right? \nEVAN Calm down. (beat) Did you remember a condom? \nSETH You brought a condom? \nEVAN Yeah, I figured, you know, might as well. I brought one of those little things of spermicidal lube too. \nHe takes them out of his pocket. \nSETH It's like me making my nuts saggier. \nEvan sees something in the distance. \nEVAN Whoa.

The cops! \nThey see a cop car with the lights flashing parked outside the liquor store. Seth and Evan cautiously approach the liquor store and look inside. They see two POLICE talking with the Cashier, and Fogell is standing right beside them! \nEVAN (CONT'D) Shit! They busted Fogell! \nINT. LIQUOR STORE - CONTINUOUS \nThe two police, OFFICER SLATER, 30 and experienced, and OFFICER MICHAELS, 25 and learning, are talking to the Cashier. Fogell stands beside them, nervous and afraid. \nOFFICER SLATER (to cashier) So, did he punch anyone else? \nCASHIER (losing it completely) I can't do this, okay!?! I told you, I have an exam tomorrow! Can you understand that? A goddamn exam! \nThe cashier breaks down crying and walks off to the back of the store. The officers look at each other. \nOFFICER MICHAELS Apparently, she has an exam. \nThey chuckle. Then they turn to Fogell. \nOFFICER SLATER (turn to Fogell) So then, son, you're the one that got punched? \nFogell looks down to his bags of liquor at his feet. Then back at the cops. He nods. \nOFFICER MICHAELS We'd like to ask you a couple questions. \nThe officers each take out a note pad and a pencil. \nOFFICER MICHAELS (CONT'D) Okay, first things first. What's your name? \n(CONTINUED) 59   CONTINUED:                                                      59 \nFogell looks like his heart is about to explode out of his chest. \nFOGELL My name, it's...it's..

And your first name? \nFogell looks twice as scared. \nFOGELL Oh...that's uh...a good one...it's a...an interesting...uh...event... \nFogell trails off mumbling and starts to breathe heavily, making an ODD NOISE. Behind him, in the window of the store, we see Seth and Evan peeking through. \nEXT. LIQUOR STORE - CONTINUOUS \nShocked, Seth and Evan walk away from the window. Seth starts to pace in anger. \nSETH I don't believe this bullshit! I can't...this isn't happening! I didn't even know you could get arrested for this shit!

I just lost a hundred dollars of Jules' money! \nEVAN We have to help him! \nSETH Help him? What are we gonna do? Bust him out of jail? I don't even know where jail is! What we need is the alcohol, which is impossible because we don't have any fucking money! \nSeth steps into the driveway leading to the parking lot. \nEVAN Fine. Just...calm down. We need to think.

There is silence for a few beats. \nFOGELL Um...hey...uh, officers. I could answer those, uh, questions now if you want. \nOFFICER SLATER We get the gist of it. You were buying some beer, some guys came in and robbed the place. I don't think we're gonna find `em this time. \nThe officers start to chuckle. \n(CONTINUED) 71   CONTINUED:                                                        71 \nFOGELL It was only one guy. \nOFFICER SLATER Only one guy? Well, fuck that. We could never catch one guy. \nOFFICER MICHAELS You see, McLovin, if it was two guys, we'd have twice the chance of catching one of them. But just one guy? I mean, how are we supposed to find one guy in this whole city? \nOFFICER SLATER Yeah, McLovin. You know how many people there are in this city? I have trouble finding people I know. \nFOGELL Aren't you guys supposed to be trained or something? Don't you have a computer? \nOFFICER SLATER Yeah, that stuff can help, but if someone walks up to me on the street, and is like, \"Hey, find Bob.\" Well, how the hell am I supposed to do that? \nFOGELL Who's Bob? \nOFFICER SLATER Exactly. If I don't know who he is, then how am I supposed to know where he is? \nOFFICER MICHAELS When you're new to the force, like I am- \nOFFICER SLATER Only six months in.

Every shelf is completely filled with beer. \nSETH Jesus's tits! \nHe grabs as many bottles as he can and starts sticking them in his pockets, when he notices two large jugs of detergent next to the washer.

No problems, no problems. \nJules laughs and Seth sees that his charm is working. \n(CONTINUED) 131   CONTINUED:                                                      131 \nSETH (CONT'D) Uh...you know...I love talking, and conversing with you, you're so good at it, but I can't hear you. Could we just go on the...uh...balcony or something? \nJules eyes Seth suspiciously. Seth just looks at her, smiling drunkenly. \nJULES Why not? I haven't conversed in ages. Let's do it. \nJules walks out of the kitchen. He finishes off his beer and then, happy as shit, drunkenly dances out of the kitchen and after Jules. \nINT. JULES' BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nEvan practically holds Helen up, almost dropping her several times, as they stumble into Jules' bedroom. Helen puts down the tequila and starts kissing Evan, but it's not nice kissing, it's sloppy porno kissing with way too much tongue. After a few moments Evan pulls away and looks at the remarkably drunk Helen. \nEVAN Are you okay? \nHELEN I so flirt with you in Math. \nEVAN Oh man. Helen...I want to tell you, I mean, I've wanted to tell you, for a long time- \nHELEN I know. I've wanted to get with you so hard. \nHelen kisses him. \nHELEN (CONT'D) Like...so hard. \nHelen yanks him onto the bed and starts sloppily kissing him again. Evan doesn't know what to do. She tries to take off Evan's shirt, but is way too inebriated to undo the buttons. Evan yanks it off. \nHELEN (CONT'D) Good... \n(CONTINUED) 132   CONTINUED:                                                    132 \nRANDOM GIRL (yelling into the house) Hey, Ricky!

JULES' ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nEvan sitting on the bed in only his boxers, and Helen is just getting her pants off, leaving her only in her lingerie. Evan's eyes widen. She looks at Evan and rubs her breasts in a very un-sexy way. \nHELEN I wore this for you. Here we go... \nHelen crawls onto the bed, pushes Evan down, and starts seriously making out with him, drunker and sloppier than ever. \nHELEN (CONT'D) Evan, I'm so wet. \nEVAN (still nervous) You're so beautiful. \nHelen shoves her hand down Evan's boxers. Evan jolts, terrified! \nHELEN You've got such a smooth cock. \nEVAN Um...thank you. I've thought you were a really incredible person for a really long time. \nEvan looks really nervous as Helen's hand starts moving up and down. \nHELEN You've got to get hard for me...real hard. \nEVAN I'm...I'm..I'm about to. But first I just want to tell you exactly how I- \nHELEN I'm gonna suck your dick so good. \nEvan is taken aback. \n(CONTINUED) 135   CONTINUED:                                                       135 \nEVAN You don't have to do that, you know, we can start this relationship on something more than just that. \nHELEN Yeah, Evan. I know. (in a sultry, whispery voice) I need you to eat my hairy love crack. \nEVAN Jesus Christ. \nEvan sits up. \nHELEN What's wrong? \nBeat. \nEVAN You don't want to do this. \nHELEN Yeah I do, I want to fuck you. \nEVAN Look, you know I really like you, Helen, but this is...it's just too intense. And I'm so drunk I don't even know how to, like, process- \nHELEN You're just being a pussy. \nEVAN What? Did you just call me a...pussy? \nHELEN Yeah...a scared little pussy- \nPUKE! Evan watches in horror as Helen vomits all over Jules' bed. \nEVAN Oh god! Oh... \nHELEN I need Becca...Becca... \nEVAN I'll...uh...I'll go get her. Are you going to be okay? \n(CONTINUED) 135   CONTINUED: (2)                                               135 \nHELEN Oh God, oh God, oh...I'm puking... \nPUKE! Evan winces as she throws up again. \nINT. JULES PARENTS'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nFogell is laying on his back on the bed and Nicola is straddling him. They are kissing. Nicola sits up and takes Fogell's hand and starts sucking his fingers. \nFOGELL I've got a boner. \nNICOLA Good. Do you have a condom? \nHe pulls a condom out. \nFogell is on top of Nicola in the missionary position. \nNICOLA Oh...uh...oh... \n(CONTINUED) 140   CONTINUED:                                                       140 \nFOGELL It's...it's in.

What the fuck? \nFOGELL Officer Slater? \nOFFICER SLATER You ran away from us! (turns to the door) Michaels! Get up here! \nFOGELL No! I hit my head when we crashed. I was all disoriented and I just wandered off, confused. Seriously! \nOFFICER MICHAELS Shut the fuck up! Wait a minute. How old was that girl? 16, 17? You sick bastard, that's statutory rape, McLovin. \nOfficer Slater appears in the doorway. \nOFFICER SLATER McLovin! \nOFFICER MICHAELS He was violating a sixteen year-old girl! \nFOGELL What? No!

I'm not really even- \nOFFICER MICHAELS Sit your ass down and keep it down. \nOFFICER SLATER You're going to jail, fucko. \nNicola, now dressed, emerges from the bathroom. She screams and runs out. They take Fogell's arms and handcuff him. \nOFFICER SLATER (CONT'D) (to Fogell) They don't take kindly to your type in jail, McLovin. \nEXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS \nDrunk, joyful, and out of breath, the boys stop running. \nEVAN Dude. You saved me! \nSETH I totally did! I wanted to! \nEVAN Wanna sleep at my house, man? You're my best friend! \nSETH Yeah! Sleepover! Fuckin...you got pizza bagels still? \nEVAN Yeah!!!! Look what else I gots! \nEvan pulls a half bottle of tequila. \nSETH Nice! \nThey start to drink it together. \nEXT. JULES' FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS \nAll the kids from the party have congregated in the front yard. The cop car is parked right in front. We see the Officers dragging Fogell through the crowd of kids. \n(CONTINUED) 142   CONTINUED:                                                       142 \nTERRY (O.S.) Stupid pigs. \nSUDDENLY, a WAD OF SPIT hits Slater in the shoulder! He turns and sees Terry, the guy who spat on Seth. Slater walks over and bashes the kid in the face with his nightstick. The kid drops. \nOFFICER SLATER There you go. \nOFFICER MICHAELS That does feel better. \nThey throw Fogell into the back of the cop car. \nINT.

EVAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nEvan, seventeen, a little too tall and slim, a boy who clearly never figured out how to style his hair, is finishing off a bowl of cereal. He is on his cell phone. \nEVAN What's up? \nSETH I was doing research last night, for next year, and I think I'm gonna go with Bang Bus. \nEVAN Which one's Bang Bus? \nSETH The one where they bang the chicks on the bus. Thirteen bucks a month. Total access, live Web Cam feed. The works. It'll be like I'm on the bus, banging them myself. \nEVAN That stuff's bullshit, they're all faking it. And plus, your parents are gonna look at the bill. \nSETH It shows up under a different name. (beat) I hope. Bang Bus.

Maybe I should just pick the one with the least dirty sounding name. \nEVAN Weapons of Ass Destruction's out then. \nSeth pulls up in front of a house. \nSETH I could tell my parents I'm doing a project on Rome and I have to research orgies. \nEXT. EVAN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nEvan walks out his front door. WE REVEAL he is walking towards Seth's car. \nEVAN (still into phone) Yeah. Just tell them your taking a class on blow jobs. \nThey both hang up and Evan gets in the car. Seth is about to pull away, when EVAN'S MOTHER comes out the front door. \nEVAN'S MOM Thanks for taking him, Seth. \nEvan changes the radio station. Seth slaps his hand. \nSETH Don't touch that! \nEVAN'S MOM You two are so funny. I can't imagine what you'll do without each other next year. Evan told me you didn't get into State. \nSETH Yeah, you know. I got some other places. Good places. I think we'll be fine. \nEVAN'S MOM Are you going to miss each other? \nEVAN Miss each other? No! \n(CONTINUED) 3   CONTINUED:                                                         3 \nSETH That's disgusting. \nMOM Bye, boys. \nSeth and Evan drive off. \nSETH I am truly, truly jealous that you got to suck on those tits when you were a baby. \nEVAN Fuck you, man. \nEXT. CLARK SECONDARY- SOON AFTER \nThey drive up to Clark Secondary. There is a giant sign that reads \"Seniors - Two Glorious Weeks Until Graduation\". Seth turns into the STAFF parking lot. \nINT/EXT. 7-11 STORE - MOMENTS LATER \nSeth and Evan walk past a group of smokers, towards the 7-11. \nEVAN You're being an idiot, man. You really shouldn't park there. \nSETH Fuck it. I'm a senior about to graduate. They should be suckin' my balls. It's the least they can do for stealing three years of my life. \n", "test1_true": "EVAN What the hell's wrong with Dimitri? \nSETH Oh, yeah dude, I forgot to tell you.

I have to hide every erection I get. \nSETH Sometimes I get boners so big I can't hide them. And then I get nervous and my heart starts pounding, and it all just, like, feeds my boner. It just becomes this...thing...that's attached to me. And it won't go away. \nEVAN Just imagine if girls weren't weirded out by our boners and they actually wanted to see `em, like this shit. \nSETH You know it's been, like, a year and a half since I've seen an actual human female nipple. Besides my mom's. I saw it last month, and it was sick. \nEVAN Holy shit. Liat was two years ago? I guess so. She was insanely hot, though. \nSETH Exactly. Too hot. That's what sucks. \nEVAN How can that possibly suck? I'd be fuckin' psyched if I'd gotten with a girl that hot. You got, like, two dozen handjobs! \nSETH And three quarters of a blowjob, But that was fuckin' it. It was the peak of my ass- gettin' career, and it happened way, way, way too early. \nEVAN You're like Orson Welles. \n(CONTINUED) 5   CONTINUED: (2)                                                  5 \nSETH Exactly! If I'd built up to it, I'd probably at least be having steady sex with a mediocre-looking girl at this point. I honestly now see why Orson Welles ate his fat ass to death. \nEVAN You'll have sex in college. Everyone does. And if not, you'll have the Bang Bus. \nSETH But the key is to be good at sex by the time you're in college. You don't want girls to think you suck dick at fucking. \nEVAN I still think you've got a chance with Jules. She got mad hot over last summer, and clearly hasn't realized it, `cause she still flirts with you. \nSETH Are you joking, man? Let's see here...she dated Dan Remick, Matt Muir, Josh Corber and what's-his-face. All of those were cool guys. She's been hot way longer than you think. Why would she end her high school career with me? \nEVAN Well, Helen got with Ariel Shafir. \nSETH Yeah, and he was a complete fucking loser. You're a step up from that. Which is why you should stop being a pussy and do her! You could nailthe shit out of her for, like, two months before you leave. That bitch looks like a good fucker. \nEVAN Hey! I'm sick of you talking about her like that, man! \nEvan starts to walk out. Seth follows. \nSETH What, you can talk about that bitch all day every single day, but I can't say one thing about her? \n(CONTINUED) 5   CONTINUED: (3)                                                  5 \nEVAN I don't constantly insult her. \nSETH I didn't insult her! I said she looks like a good fucker! She looks like she can take a dick. That's a good thing. Some women pride themselves on their dick- taking abilities. \nEXT. 7-11 - CONTINUOUS \nSeth and Evan come out the front doors. TERRY, one of the rough-looking smokers, calls out. \nTERRY Yo. Seth. Did you hear I'm having the big grad party? \nEvan, a little scared, keeps his distance. \nSETH No. \nTERRY Yeah. \nTerry spits on Seth's shirt. \nTERRY (CONT'D) And you're not coming. Tell your fucking faggot friend he can't come either. \nSeth wipes the spit off. He looks at Terry and seems as though he's about to say something, but is interrupted when Terry starts hocking up more spit. Seth runs away as Terry and his friends laugh. He catches up to Evan and they head back to school. \nEVAN Wow. You really bitched out on that one. \nSETH I bitched out? You bitched out! You were across the street before I even realized what was going on. (beat) That guy's such a douche bag. \nEXT.

Just look at him. \nThey look at the Driver, who is staring at Evan with a dumb expression on his face. \nDRIVER (to Evan) You know a guy named Jimmy, perchance?

A few moments later, the cops walk out with Fogell right behind them carrying the bags of liquor. \nOFFICER SLATER (to Fogell) Man, that lady just wouldn't stop crying, huh? And you're the one that got punched. Did you hear her say she has an exam tomorrow? Boo-fuckin'-hoo. Am I right? \nFOGELL (afraid) Heh. Good one. \nOFFICER MICHEALS Could we have taken her in? Just to scare the shit out of her? \nOFFICER SLATER Hah. Probably could have found a way. But a good general rule is only take people in you want to ride with. And whiny bitches don't make that cut. \nThe cops chuckle as they all get in the cop car. \nINT. DRIVER'S CAR - CONTINUOUS \nSeth and Evan sit in the back seat. The Driver is in the front. \nDRIVER One of you bros could have sat up here with me. \nThere is an awkward silence, when suddenly Seth starts to wriggle in discomfort. \nSETH Aaah! \nSeth fishes his cell phone out of his pocket and looks at it. \nSETH(CONT'D) (thinking) Holy shit... \nSeth answers the phone. \nSETH (CONT'D) Jules!

I can't believe I actually did that. \nJULES I feel sorry that I'm making you buy me a new one. \nHELEN I have to. It's puke. \nANGLE ON: Seth and Evan \nEVAN Holy shit! \nHelen looks like hell and Jules has a horrible black eye. \nSETH Is that them? \nThey stare at the two girls from afar. \nEVAN Should we hide? \nHelen looks and notices them. She waves and points them out to Jules. Seth and Evan wave back. The girls get up and start to walk over. \nSETH (pretending to smile) Fuck that, man. I can't talk to her, look what I did to her! \nEVAN (pretending to smile) Helen called me a pussy to my face! What am I going to say to her? \nThe girls walk up to them. \nHELEN                                JULES Hi Evan, Seth.                       Hey guys. \nEVAN                                 SETH Hi Helen, Hi Jules.                  Jules. Helen. Hi. \nEveryone looks very embarrassed. \nSETH Oh my god.

No! I mean, it doesn't look terrible, it looks- \nJULES Don't worry about it, Seth. It was an accident. \nEVAN (to Helen) Did you have fun last night? \nJULES (to Seth) Do you remember much? \nHELEN (to Evan) I really don't remember much. \nSETH (to Jules) Not really. I remember looking up, and you screaming at me. That's about it. \nJules laughs. \nHELEN (to Evan) I didn't puke on you, did I? \nEvan laughs. \nEVAN No, I dodged it. Whizzed right by me. \nSETH (to Jules) But seriously, I acted like a fuckin' idiot last night. I'm really sorry, you didn't deserve that. \n(CONTINUED) 150   CONTINUED: (3)                                                150 \nHELEN (to Evan) Yeah, I...um...I'm sorry, about all that. Thanks for being such a gentleman. \nThere is a moment of silence. \nSETH You look good with a black eye. \nThey all chuckle a little. \nJULES Thanks, smart guy. That's why I'm here. I have to go to Macy's to get a shitload of cover-up for the grad photo. \nSETH (mortified) Oh man... \nHELEN Yeah, and I'm going to Linen Brothers to buy Jules a new comforter. \nEVAN Oh! I have to get a comforter too, for college. \nJULES (flirtatiously, joking) So, you gonna come with me to Macy's and buy me my cover-up, or what? \nSETH Yes! Definitely. I'd love to. I had such bad acne last year, I became an expert on the stuff. \n"}

He's in his uniform holding a hanger with a shirt and a vest. \nSETH What the hell is that? \nFOGELL A vest. \nSETH You're gonna look like a Pinocchio. \nEVAN What? It's just a vest. \nFOGELL Yeah. How many high schoolers you see in vests? \nSETH (eyeing Shopwell's) You know, they got a ton of liquor right in there. If we get it now we can get to the party faster with all of Jules' shit. \nFOGELL No way! I work there. They know I'm not twenty-five. \nSETH Nobody said anything about you, dick- mouth. You have one name on your ID. It's out of the equation!

No! Hell no! You can't do that! \nEVAN (mocking) Yeah, right! \nSETH That's right. And that way I give Jules back her money, like you did with Helen. That was good thinking, that's fucking pimp. That's how you seal a deal. It won't be hard. Remember Dan Vertlieb stole a keg from here and he's got, like, really bad scoliosis! \nEVAN You're not gonna steal it. Fogell, he's not going to steal it. \nFOGELL Please. Don't do this! I promise. I'll get the liquor later. \nSETH I'm stepping up. And once I'm up, I don't step back down. Maybe you \"State\" boys don't understand that. \nSeth walks to the store. \nINT. SHOPWELL'S - CONTINUOUS \nSeth enters the store, looking determined. He spots a SECURITY GUARD standing by one of the registers. \nSETH (to himself) Hope piggy can run. \nHe walks past the registers, which brings him in front of the long liquor aisle. He surveys the scene. There is an OLD WOMAN browsing the shelves. Seth looks over to the registers. \nINT. SHOPWELL'S (FANTASY) - EVENING \nSeth is at the cash register. He has a huge amount of booze in the conveyor belt. \nCASHIER How old are you? \n(CONTINUED) 44   CONTINUED:                                                      44 \nSETH Twenty two. \nCASHIER You certainly are. That'll be eighty dollars. \nSeth hands the cashier a big EIGHTY DOLLAR BILL. \nSETH Thank you kindly. \nCASHIER You're welcome, Seth. \nINT. SHOPWELL'S - CONTINUOUS \nSeth, still standing in front of the liquor aisle, shakes his head. He eyeballs the old lady. \nINT. SHOPWELL'S (FANTASY) - EVENING \nThe old lady is browsing. She drops her big purse. A hand reaches down and picks it up. It's Seth. \nSETH Excuse me, ma'am. You dropped your purse. Would you like me to help you to your car? \nOLD LADY That would be lovely, young man. Would you like me to buy you alcohol? \nSETH That would be lovely! \nEXT. SHOPWELL'S (FANTASY) - MOMENTS LATER \nSeth, holding two huge bags of liquor, waves to the Old Lady as she drives away. \nSETH Enjoy your remaining years! \nOLD LADY I will.

He takes it and looks down at it in his hands. A big golden label reads, \"GOLDSCHLAGER.\" \n", "test1_true": "We see that the Security Guard is right behind him. Seth doesn't look up, he just stares at the bottle dramatically. \nSETH I never had a choice. \nHe throws the bottle at the guards face. The guard blocks it with his billy club, grabs another bottle, and hurls it at Seth. Seth dodges it by an inch; the bottle hits the OLD LADY in the head. \nOLD LADY (in agony) AAAHHHHH!!! \nBefore Seth can do anything, the guard smashes a 40-ounce bottle of beer across his face. The guard SWINGS the broken end of the bottle and cuts Seth's throat. Blood spurts out. Seth drops his bottles and falls to the ground. \nEXT. SHOPWELL'S - CONTINUOUS \nEvan and Fogell are talking. \nFOGELL Oh, and, uh, my Mom said we can have the TV from her basement and I've got, like, three lava-lamps and one strobe light, so like, we can have that in the room- \nEvan sees Seth coming out of Shopwell's. \nEVAN Shh. Seth's coming. \nFOGELL You still didn't tell him we're rooming- \nEVAN No. Shut up. \nFOGELL (to Seth) So, where's all the stolen liquor? \n(CONTINUED) 49   CONTINUED:                                                        49 \nSETH Fuck you! I was gonna do it, but security was tight as shit. I was gonna do it though, don't think I wasn't. Let's go to the liquor store and try your stupid ID. \nSeth heads towards the bus stop. \nFOGELL Wait! I'm gonna put my vest back in my locker! \nINT. BUS - MOMENTS LATER \nMORE MIND-BLOWINGLY BADASS FUNK MUSIC OVER Seth, Evan and Fogell sitting on the bus amidst a bunch of gloomy, unpleasant looking strangers. Nothing happens whatsoever. \nEXT. LIQUOR STORE - EVENING \nThe bus stops in front of the liquor store and the guys get out. \nEVAN Well, here we are. Fogell, are you ready? \nSETH Here's the list. \nFOGELL A list? Why? \nSETH We're getting girls their booze so they'll get with us. I put a lot of thought into that list. It's the perfect party bar, so don't mess it up and get Sambuca again. \nFogell reads the list. A worried look sweeps across his face. \nFOGELL Ouzo, Drambuie, Jager, Gold-shlay-ger- \nEVAN Goldschlager. That's for Helen, so do not forget it. \nFOGELL -Alize, Captain Morgan Rum, Smirnoff Rasberry and a big ass bottle of Popov- \n(CONTINUED) 51   CONTINUED:                                                       51 \nSETH Oh yeah, and Mike's Hard Lemonade. \nFOGELL This is too much. I can't get away with this much! \nEVAN What's the difference? \nSeth hands Fogell the money. \nFOGELL I don't know, man. I'm getting, like, really nervous. \nFogell starts breathing very hard and making an ODD NOISE while doing so. \nEVAN Are you okay? \nSETH What the hell are you doing? \nFOGELL I don't know if I want to do this. \nSETH What are you talking about? You just promised you would. What is this shit? \nFOGELL What if they turn me down? \nSETH Then we're in the same place that we're in right now! \nFOGELL It's fucking humiliating! Everyone in the store sees them kicking me out. What if they make me put all the liquor back on the shelf? I can't do that! \nSETH This whole thing is bigger than you, asshead! Just go in there and buy the damn alcohol! \n", "test1_id": 1938, "test2_input": "FOGELL What if I don't feel like it anymore? \n(CONTINUED) 51   CONTINUED: (2)                                                 51 \nSETH Then I will kill you! How's that? If you don't buy the alcohol, I will kill you! \nFOGELL Killing me won't get you any alcohol, jerkoff! I'm the one with the ID! \nSETH Then I will kill you, cut off your ugly face, put it over mine, and buy it my fucking self. \nFOGELL You don't have the technology or the steady hands to pull off a procedure like that! \nSeth stands for a moment, then suddenly rushes Fogell. Evan stands between them and breaks it up. \nEVAN Seth, calm down! Fogell, stop being a baby and go buy the alcohol! You said you'd do it, so do it. It's why you bought the ID, so just go do it. \nFOGELL (beat) I'll try. \nFogell walks into the store. \nINT. LIQUOR STORE - CONTINUOUS \nAt first it all seems overwhelming. Fogell is confused, dizzy, and sweating. He steps behind a large beer display and takes a few deep breaths. \nCLERK Hi there. \nFogell flinches, shocked someone spoke to him. He keeps walking. He nears a mother and her 17 year old SON. As Fogell passes them, the son seems to recognize him. Fogell clearly recognizes the son. Their eyes meet. Fogell looks in the opposite direction. \nSON Fogell? \n(CONTINUED) 52   CONTINUED:                                                       52 \nFOGELL (weird voice, covering his face) No. \nSON Yo, Fogell. `Sup man. What're you doing here? \nFOGELL (weird voice) Uh...nothing. Not Fogell... (whisper) Shut up, Moscovitch. You don't know me. \nMOSCOVITCH (knowingly) Oh, oh. Cool, cool. Good luck. \nHe puts his head down and quickly walks away. He arrives at the beer and cooler section. Clearly intimidated, he slowly opens a beer fridge. He grabs one beer attached to a six-pack and pulls it forward. The beer comes loose in his hand as the other five fall to the ground, cracking on impact, and spraying beer all over the place. Fogell scrambles to stop the beers from spraying, but soon finds that it is impossible. \nFOGELL Fuck. \nA CLERK approaches Fogell. \nCLERK Is there a problem, sir? \nFOGELL Umm, nope, no problem whatsoever. \nCLERK (pointing to the beer on the floor) Sir, did you do this? On the floor? \nFOGELL (beat) No. (beat) I think it happened before. \nFogell is standing in a puddle of beer with beer sprayed all over his legs, holding a can of beer. \n(CONTINUED) 52   CONTINUED: (2)                                                 52 \nCLERK Are you sure? \nFOGELL I think I would know, thank you. \nFogell walks away. \nINT. LIQUOR STORE - LATER \nFogell has a shopping cart filled with booze. He gets in line to pay. He looks ahead to the OLD-LOOKING GUY (35) who is currently at the CASHIER (woman) paying. \nCASHIER Um, yes, may I please see some ID? \nOLD-LOOKING GUY No problem. Heh. I haven't been ID-ed in years. \nCASHIER Anyone who looks under thirty-five. \nThe guy looks through his wallet. Fogell nervously watches. \nEXT. LIQUOR STORE - CONTINUOUS \nSeth and Evan peek through one of the store's front windows. \nSETH It's a good ID, right? Mike Snider never had a problem. It's fine. Right? \nEVAN Calm down. (beat) Did you remember a condom? \nSETH You brought a condom? \nEVAN Yeah, I figured, you know, might as well. I brought one of those little things of spermicidal lube too. \nHe takes them out of his pocket. \n", "test2_true": "(CONTINUED) 54   CONTINUED:                                                        54 \nEVAN It doesn't mean you shouldn't be prepared. You didn't even bring one? \nSETH No. That wasn't the plan! We had a plan! I can't believe you did that without even consulting me about it! \nEVAN I don't really even understand what your plan is. \nSETH I'm gonna go down on her for, like, hours. She'll love that. She'll want to go out with that. \nEVAN Yeah, but I figured there's no harm in bringing just one little condom. \nSETH And one little bottle of spermicidal lube. That's nuts. You can't let her know you brought that! These girls are 18, not dried up old ladies. They're ready to go. \nEVAN Fine. I won't bring the lube. \nINT. LIQUOR STORE - CONTINUOUS \nFogell pushes his stuff up to the Cashier. She looks at him kind of funny. \nFOGELL Hello... (reading name tag) Mindy. \nShe rings up a six pack of Budweiser. \nFOGELL (CONT'D) Oh, I love that stuff. Been drinking it for years. I heard they recently decided to start adding more hops. \nFogell just nods kind of proud of himself.

LIQUOR STORE - CONTINUOUS \nSeth and Evan are still leaning against the window. \nEVAN Do you think I could get Helen to do some kind of long distance thing? \nSeth looks as if he sees something in the distance. He stands upright. \nSETH Holy Shit! It's Cary Hutchins! \nEVAN I haven't seen her since she switched schools. \nSETH She had the biggest tits in the universe. \nDown the block there is a girl walking a dog. \nEVAN I heard she had breast-reduction surgery. Her tits must be crazy perfect now. \nSETH I gotta see these bastards. Let's check `em out. \nSeth and Evan run off towards the girl. \nSETH (CONT'D) Man, I'm gonna pretend to trip and grab `em.

She starts to gather his change when, SUDDENLY, a BIG GUY runs up and PUNCHES Fogell right in the side of the head!!! Fogell falls to the ground. The dude sticks his hand in the open register, grabs a handful of money and runs! \nThe whole thing is over in a matter of seconds. Fogell is on the ground, dazed and confused. \nFOGELL What the hell happened?! \nFogell sees the distressed cashier frantically dialing the police. \nCASHIER (breathing hard) I don't believe it...I don't believe it.... \nEXT. UP THE STREET FROM THE LIQUOR STORE - MOMENTS LATER \nSeth and Evan walk down the street towards the liquor store. \nEVAN That was a waste. \nSETH But she fully looked way better before. I thought when they reduced them, they just kind of reshaped them nicer. Made them more supple. \nEVAN I can't even begin to imagine the justification for making breasts smaller. \n", "test2_id": 1939, "test3_input": "DRIVER It's all I have. \nSETH Well, you just came from the liquor store, give us your liquor. \nDRIVER I didn't get any.

It's killing me. \nSeth, acting poorly, pretends he's way more hurt than he is. \nDRIVER No! Wait! Okay, you want alcohol?   I can get you alcohol. I'm on my way to   this party right now.

Just look at him. \nThey look at the Driver, who is staring at Evan with a dumb expression on his face. \nDRIVER (to Evan) You know a guy named Jimmy, perchance?

LIQUOR STORE - MOMENTS LATER \nThe Driver's car pulls away with Seth and Evan sitting in the back seat. A few moments later, the cops walk out with Fogell right behind them carrying the bags of liquor. \nOFFICER SLATER (to Fogell) Man, that lady just wouldn't stop crying, huh? And you're the one that got punched. Did you hear her say she has an exam tomorrow? Boo-fuckin'-hoo. Am I right? \nFOGELL (afraid) Heh. Good one. \nOFFICER MICHEALS Could we have taken her in? Just to scare the shit out of her? \nOFFICER SLATER Hah. Probably could have found a way. But a good general rule is only take people in you want to ride with. And whiny bitches don't make that cut. \nThe cops chuckle as they all get in the cop car. \nINT. DRIVER'S CAR - CONTINUOUS \nSeth and Evan sit in the back seat. The Driver is in the front. \nDRIVER One of you bros could have sat up here with me. \nThere is an awkward silence, when suddenly Seth starts to wriggle in discomfort. \nSETH Aaah! \nSeth fishes his cell phone out of his pocket and looks at it. \nSETH(CONT'D) (thinking) Holy shit... \nSeth answers the phone. \nSETH (CONT'D) Jules!

I can't wait for you to get here. \nA huge smile sweeps across Seth's face. \nSETH Really? \n(CONTINUED) 65   CONTINUED:                                                        65 \nJULES Yeah. It looks like it could actually be a great party. I think, like, tons of people might show up.

STREET IN FRONT OF PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe Driver's car pulls up in front of a house. The three get out. \nEVAN Hey, are you sure that it's cool we're here? \nDRIVER Oh, definitely. I'm essentially best friends with this guy. A whole bunch of my buddies are coming. Come on! \nThe Driver runs into the house happily, Seth and Evan following closely behind. \nINT.

All we gotta do is find the booze and haul ass out of here. \nAs they make their way down a hallway, a few people give them looks. \nINT. HOUSE PARTY - KITCHEN \nThey enter the kitchen, where Seth spots what they've been looking for. There are big buckets of ice filled with beer, coolers, wine, vodka, everything. \nSETH Holy shit! Let's grab one of these buckets and go. \nMARK (O.S.) What the fuck do you think you're doing? \nDRIVER (O.S.) What, man? It's nothing. \nThe guys turn and see that in corner of the kitchen, the Driver, holding a phone, is being yelled at by a massive brute, MARK. \nMARK You calling more of your stupid friends again? Ya prick. \nDRIVER Mark, calm down, okay? Just relax. \nMARK Get the fuck out of my house. \nDRIVER Mark, come on. What the heck? Don't be a dick. \nSuddenly, Mark grabs the Driver by the back of the neck and drags him out of the kitchen, down the front hall and out the door. A group of people follow, including Seth and Evan. \nEXT. HOUSE PARTY - CONTINUOUS \nThe Driver get pushed out of the door and lands on the front lawn.

I'll fucking do this! \nSuddenly, Mark becomes enraged. He takes a big step forward and brutally KICKS the Driver square in the nuts! \nThe Driver clutches his nuts and falls to the ground. \nMARK Francis, you and your idiot friends stay the away from me and mine or I'll flipping shiv your ass! \nMark and his buddies head back in, leading them towards Seth and Evan, who quickly duck back into the party. \nINT. HOUSE PARTY - CONTINUOUS \nThe frightened boys walk into one of the first rooms and hide in the corner. They have a hushed discussion. \nEVAN Dude, let's slip out the back. \nSETH Why? Come on, we're here. Let's just hurry up and do this. \nEVAN You want to end up like that guy? Not me, I need my nuts. \nSETH We need this liquor! \nEVAN You need it! I don't need it.

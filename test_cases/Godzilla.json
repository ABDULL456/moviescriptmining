With the ocean in the distance, through the heat waves we SEE a row of official looking black sedans coming toward us. \n13  EXT. PAPEETE HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS - DAY                    13 \nThe doors to the sedans open as a group of very official looking Government types. Stopping to light his cigarette is PHILLIP RAYMOND, 40's, intense, dangerous and worst of all...French. \n14  INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY                 14 \nRaymond leads the official looking group down the hall. A BRIEFING OFFICER rushes over. (The following dialog is entirely in French with subtitles) \nBRIEFING OFFICER The Japanese consulate has been calling and we've been getting pressure from the Americans. \nRAYMOND What did you tell them? \nBRIEFING OFFICER Nothing yet. \nRAYMOND Are there any other survivors? \nBRIEFING OFFICER Only one, Sir. He was very lucky. \nThe group arrives at a door at the end of the hall. The Briefing Officer opens the door. \nRAYMOND'S P.O.V. - THROUGH OPEN DOOR \nIn the corner of the large room we see the old Cook from the tanker curled up in the fetal position. The doctors and a few nurses are attending to him. \nRAYMOND Get them out of there. \nTwo of the Officials move in and escort the Doctors and Nurses out of the room. Raymond nods to two other Officials who begin to unpack some recording equipment, including a video camera. \n15  INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - SAME                                   15 \nRaymond enters and moves close to the old Cook, kneeling down in front of him, inspecting his distant glare. The old Cook seems to be in a world of his own, rocking back and forth. Raymond nods to another Official who comes forward. \nRAYMOND (in French) Ask him what happened. \nThe Second Official ask him in Japanese, but the old Cook does not respond. He asks again but the old Cook seems to be in a world of his own. \nBRIEFING OFFICER (in English) It's no use. He's been like this since we fished him out of the ocean. Whatever happened to that tanker put him in a complete state of shock. \nRaymond takes out his lighter and ignites it on high. The old Cook's eyes slowly come back to life, transfixed by the fire. Slowly he brings the flame close to the old Cook's face. \nRAYMOND (in English) What did you see, old man? \nDrawn out of himself by the flame... \nOLD COOK (weakly) Gojira...Gojira... \nRaymond shoots a look at the Second Official for an explanation. \nSECOND OFFICIAL (in English) I have no idea what he is saying. \nOLD COOK (stronger) ...Gojira!...Gojira!...GOJIRA!! \nCUT TO: \n16  EXT.

As he walks towards shore he SEES... \nNICK'S P.O.V. - POLICE BARRICADE \nDozens of citizens as well as the press are gathered at a police barricade; their access to the village denied. Panamanian Police and U.S. military working together to keep people out. \nMarching up the shore to greet Nick is MAJOR TONY HICKS, 30's, efficient, who is spearheading this operation. \nMAJOR HICKS Dr. Niko Topopolosis? \nNICK (correcting) It's Tatopoulos. \nMAJOR HICKS Right. The worm guy. (to guards at blockade) Can someone get those people off the beach? \nNICK Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell I'm doing here? \nMAJOR HICKS Follow me. \nThe Major leads Nick up the beach away from the crowds. \nNICK You didn't answer my question. In fact, for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions. \nMAJOR HICKS We have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise. \nANGLE - DESTROYED VILLAGE HUT \nSeveral soldiers and researchers are investigating the site when Nick and the Major walk past. \n", "test1_true": "MAJOR HICKS We know. \nMajor Hicks motions to some guards who clear a blockade away from a jungle pathway. Major Hicks takes the pathway. \nNICK Do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the Chernobyl earthworm? \nMAJOR HICKS Yeah, you're the worm guy. \nNICK The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's DNA! You have any idea what that means? \nMAJOR HICKS No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out. \nNICK It means that due to a man made accident the Chernobyl earthworms are now over seventeen percent larger than they were before. Mutated by seventeen percent? \nMajor Hicks stops, turns to Nick. \nMAJOR HICKS (bemused) Seventeen percent, huh? Sounds big. \nNICK They're enormous! A new species created by man's recklessness. That's what I've been trying to tell you, I'm only a biologist. I take radioactive samples and study them. \nMAJOR HICKS Then you're perfect. (pointing to the ground) Here's your radioactive sample. Study it. \nWith that Major Hicks walks away. \nNICK What sample? \nMAJOR HICKS You're standing on it. \nNick looks down, sees nothing. \nNICK I don't see it. (no response) Where is it? \nWe CRANE UP above him, pulling back farther and farther, until we SEE he's standing inside of a 15 YARD LONG GIGANTIC FOOTPRINT in the sand. \nNICK (CONT'D) I don't see it! \nTwo scientists have spread out a tape measure to document its length as two others inspect it with Geiger counters. Nick sees them and realizes he's standing in a remarkable discovery. He looks up ahead and SEES... \nOVERHEAD TITLT SHOT - Foot steps...- \nFive gigantic footsteps in front of him. Other researchers examining the prints with all kinds of equipment. Geiger counters, CLICK, CLICKING away. Nick is stunned. \n18   EXT. TATTERED VILLAGE REMAINS - MOMENTS LATER               18 \nNick rushes to catch up with Major Hicks who walks towards a command tent in the distance. \nNICK (flabbergasted) That was a footprint. I was standing inside a footprint. \nMAJOR HICKS That's right. \nNICK But there's no animal in the world that can make prints like that? Is there? \nMAJOR HICKS We're hoping you're going to help us figure that out. \nThe Major gestures to the many villagers who are being attended to. Some are injured, others are being examined for radiation. The village has been decimated. \nNICK Somebody must have seen it. \nMAJOR HICKS It happened so fast no one knew what hit them 'til is was over. \nA jeep pulls up and PETERS, a young researcher, comes rushing over with a video tape in his hands. As he passes Major Hicks... \nPETERS (on the run) Tape's in. The French finally released it. \nPeters takes off for the command' tent. Nick and the Major follow. \nCOMMAND TENT - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nPart military, part scientific command post. Lots of activity. Peters waves the tape as he rushes over to a television. Major Hicks and Nick follow. \nMAJOR HICKS A tanker was attacked and sunk yesterday near the French Polynesians. We think there's a connection. \nWOMAN SCIENTIST (ELSIE) Is that the tape of the witness? \nExcitedly, ELSIE CHAPMAN, heavy set, early 30's, paleontologist and head of the research team, leads several of her colleagues over to the t.v. \nNICK Hi. Nick Tatopoulos... \nELSIE Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist. \nShe's clearly attracted to him. This doesn't escape Nick, who's not too comfortable with her flirtatious glare. She turns to a scientist standing next to her, DR. CLIVE CRAVEN. \nELSIE (CONT'D) Dr. Craven, have you met the worm guy? \nDR. CRAVEN Nice to meet you. \nThe t.v. turns on and we SEE the old Cook, rocking on his bed, repeating over and over the same word... \nOLD COOK (filtered through t.v.) ...Gojira...Gojira...Gojira... \nThis is all too overwhelming for him. He turns from the t.v. and looks out into the jungle. \nSlowly he walks away, staring at something in the distance with total awe. Elsie walks up next to him. \nELSIE What could have possibly done all that? \nWe REVERSE ANGLE and SEE what they are staring at. \n", "test1_id": 1071, "test2_input": "ANGLE - HALLWAY - ENTRY LEVEL - CONTINUOUS \nCautiously they move towards us.

Raymond walks behind the egg, illuminating it from the other side, making it partially translucent. We can SEE THE EMBRYO inside the egg and IT'S MOVING! \nNICK Three eggs.

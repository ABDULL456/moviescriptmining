{"train": "GODZILLA first draft by Dean Devlin & Roland Emmerich \nGODZILLA \nby \nDean Devlin & Roland Emmerich \nFirst Draft 2/19/96 \nFADE IN: \nAn iguana... \nCrawling off its nest, leaving its eggs exposed. \n1  EXT. MORUROA ATOLL ISLANDS, FRENCH POLYNESIA - PACIFIC       1 \nGrainy, Kodak color, nineteen sixties documentary footage of a beautiful Polynesian island. We SEE quick shots of Kimono Dragons, Gila Monsters and Chameleons all in their natural tropical environment. \nSuper: Moruro Atoll Islands, French Polynesia - June \nIncongruously over this jungle environment we HEAR a static ridden radio filtered VOICE, slowly counting down in French. It is almost as through the reptiles of the island are reacting to the countdown as they anxiously move about. \nSuddenly with a brilliant FLASH OF WHITE LIGHT, a nuclear EXPLOSION mushrooms into the sky. \nWe SEE a SERIES of REAL shots of footage of some of the over one hundred and sixty official nuclear tests the French government held in this tropical region. \nExplosion after explosion devastates the locale. One building after the next, accelerating in momentum, culminating in one final EXPLOSION. \nThe clould-filled sky begins to drizzle. The ash-like fallout drifts downward onto what's left of the islands below. \nWe FOLLOW this ash as it settles next to a dead reptile, unrecognizable now, and down onto what's left of the lizard's eggs. \nSuddenly the image clears from the grainy footage to clean, modern high resolution. We ZOOM IN on one of the eggs as it slowly gets buried in the falling ash. WE continue to push in, getting closer...closer... \nSMASH CUT TO: \n2  EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - OIL TANKER - RAINSTORM - NIGHT          2 \nSmashing through the choppy waters, barely by the storm we SEE the CORI AKIDO, a Japanese oil supertanker. \nSuper: Pacific Ocean, present day \n3  INT. CORI AKIDO - BRIDGE - NIGHT                             3 \nWe TRACK across the complicated computerized navigational console that is actually steering the immense ship. In the b.g. we HEAR a Japanese t.v. program playing. \nAt the end of the console is the ship's SKIPPER, an overweight Japanese seaman sleepily watches a snowy satellite broadcast of a Sumo wrestling match. \nSuddenly the SONAR blares out a warning ALARM. Startled, the Skipper awakes and stumbles out of his chair over to the console. \nThe SONAR displays an enormous MASS heading quickly toward the ship. The Skipper's eyes go wide. He hits a KLAXON alarm, awaking the entire ship. He presses the radio/intercom. \nSKIPPER (in Japanese) Captain. This is the bridge. We have an emergency. \n4  INT. SUPERTANKER'S HALLWAYS - SAME - NIGHT                   4 \nAlarms BLARING. The crew rushes out of their quarters and into the hall. Quickly they race for the upper decks. \n5  INT. OTHER HALLWAY - BY KITCHEN                              5 \nThe ship's elderly COOK pokes his head out of the kitchen and yells at some of the crew as they pass by. \nCOOK (in Japanese) What's going on? What's happening? \nBefore anyone can answer, the ship is ROCKED by an enormous THUD as something hits the side of the immense ship. The crew TUMBLES as the ship SWAYS VIOLENTLY. \nThe old Cook is thrown to the floor. He looks up nervously. \n6  INT. BRIDGE - SAME - NIGHT                                   6 \nThe CAPTAIN enters quickly, joining the Skipper at the console. \nCAPTAIN (in Japanese) What was that!? \nSKIPPER (in Japanese) I can't tell... \nAgain, the ship is HIT. An enormous CRASHING SOUND is HEARD as the ship ROCKS to one side, tossing the Captain and Skipper to the floor. \nSuddenly we HEAR the tell-tale, famous SCREAMING WAIL of our creature from somewhere outside. Terror shines in the Captain's eyes at the sound. \n7  INT. HALLWAYS - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                           7 \nThe crew, getting back on their feet, reacts to the horrible WAILING SOUND. \nSuddenly the ship is HIT AGAIN. This time something enormous RIPS THROUGH THE HULL, crushing one of the crew members as it TEARS THROUGH THE WALLS. \nWater RUSHES THROUGH the large gaping hole, quickly filling the hallway. The Cook and what's left of the crew scurry for the stairs, as the water level chases them. \n8  INT. BRIDGE - SAME - NIGHT                                   8 \nThe ship's computers are WHIRLING with warning lights and alarms. As the Skipper tries to adjust the controls in vain, the Captain grabs the ship's p.a. system. \nCAPTAIN (in Japanese) Abandon ship! Abandon ship! Man the lifeboats... \nBut before he can say anything more, something WHIPS across the bridge's enormous windshield, SHATTERING THE GLASS. Was it a tail? No way, far too big. \n9  EXT. SHIP'S DECK - SAME - NIGHT                              9 \nTERRINGTON It is now. \nCUT TO: \n12  EXT. PAPEETE - TAHITI - STREET - DAY                        12 \nCoastal town of Papeete, Tahiti. With the ocean in the distance, through the heat waves we SEE a row of official looking black sedans coming toward us. \n13  EXT. PAPEETE HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS - DAY                    13 \nThe doors to the sedans open as a group of very official looking Government types. Stopping to light his cigarette is PHILLIP RAYMOND, 40's, intense, dangerous and worst of all...French. \n14  INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY                 14 \nRaymond leads the official looking group down the hall. A BRIEFING OFFICER rushes over. (The following dialog is entirely in French with subtitles) \nBRIEFING OFFICER The Japanese consulate has been calling and we've been getting pressure from the Americans. \nRAYMOND What did you tell them? \nBRIEFING OFFICER Nothing yet. \nRAYMOND Are there any other survivors? \nBRIEFING OFFICER Only one, Sir. He was very lucky. \nThe group arrives at a door at the end of the hall. The Briefing Officer opens the door. \nRAYMOND'S P.O.V. - THROUGH OPEN DOOR \nIn the corner of the large room we see the old Cook from the tanker curled up in the fetal position. The doctors and a few nurses are attending to him. \nRAYMOND Get them out of there. \nTwo of the Officials move in and escort the Doctors and Nurses out of the room. Raymond nods to two other Officials who begin to unpack some recording equipment, including a video camera. \n15  INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - SAME                                   15 \nRaymond enters and moves close to the old Cook, kneeling down in front of him, inspecting his distant glare. The old Cook seems to be in a world of his own, rocking back and forth. Raymond nods to another Official who comes forward. \nRAYMOND (in French) Ask him what happened. \nThe Second Official ask him in Japanese, but the old Cook does not respond. He asks again but the old Cook seems to be in a world of his own. \nBRIEFING OFFICER (in English) It's no use. He's been like this since we fished him out of the ocean. Whatever happened to that tanker put him in a complete state of shock. \nRaymond takes out his lighter and ignites it on high. The old Cook's eyes slowly come back to life, transfixed by the fire. Slowly he brings the flame close to the old Cook's face. \nRAYMOND (in English) What did you see, old man? \nDrawn out of himself by the flame... \nOLD COOK (weakly) Gojira...Gojira... \nRaymond shoots a look at the Second Official for an explanation. \nSECOND OFFICIAL (in English) I have no idea what he is saying. \nOLD COOK (stronger) ...Gojira!...Gojira!...GOJIRA!! \nCUT TO: \n16  EXT. GULF OF DEN SAN MIGUEL, PANAMA - DAY                   16 \nA small sea plane flies over this jungle region of Panama, darting up the Gulf into the lush greenery of the countryside. \nSuper: Guilfo de San Miguel, Panama - 45 km outside of La Paz \nSlowly the plane begins to descend, landing by a small village. \n17  EXT. VILLAGE FISHING DOCK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY             17 \nSeveral soldiers unload Nick's cargo as he steps out of the plane onto the dock. As he walks towards shore he SEES... \nNICK'S P.O.V. - POLICE BARRICADE \nDozens of citizens as well as the press are gathered at a police barricade; their access to the village denied. Panamanian Police and U.S. military working together to keep people out. \nMarching up the shore to greet Nick is MAJOR TONY HICKS, 30's, efficient, who is spearheading this operation. \nMAJOR HICKS Dr. Niko Topopolosis? \nNICK (correcting) It's Tatopoulos. \nMAJOR HICKS Right. The worm guy. (to guards at blockade) Can someone get those people off the beach? \nNICK Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell I'm doing here? \nMAJOR HICKS Follow me. \nThe Major leads Nick up the beach away from the crowds. \nNICK You didn't answer my question. In fact, for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions. \nMAJOR HICKS We have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise. \nANGLE - DESTROYED VILLAGE HUT \nSeveral soldiers and researchers are investigating the site when Nick and the Major walk past. \nLEONARD and his 1st MATE are puzzled by the engine WHINE of their own ship. \nLEONARD Jerry, why are we slowing down? \nJERRY (O.S.) She's heavy in the bunt. \nLEONARD That was fast. \n26  EXT. THE GROUCHO - SAME - DAY                               26 \nThe captain, JULES, hasn't noticed a thing as he lays on his deck tanning himself, a boom-abox blaring next to him. Suddenly THUD. The ship JOLTS for a second. Jules slides and BANGS his head into the boom-box. He yelps. \nDECK HAND The nets are full! \nJULES Then bring 'em in! \nDECK HAND We can't. She won't budge! \nJules gets up to move aft when THUD, again the ship ROCKS. \nALL THREE BOATS SLOW TO A CRAWL \nArthur tries to GUN his engine but it only WHINES. Soon all three boats STOP DEAD. Nothing but quiet for a long beat. \nARTHUR What is going on? \nThen with another JOLT all three boats begin to move BACKWARDS, DRAGGED BY THEIR OWN NETS! \nLEONARD She's going sternway! \nFIRST MATE What the hell did we catch? \nThe three boats begin to PICK UP SPEED, moving BACKWARDS in the water. Water SPLASHES up into the boats, winches begin to CRACK under the building pressure. \nThe boats begin to move incredibly FAST backwards. Things on the boat begin to BREAK and CRASH DOWN onto the decks of the ships. \nJULES Cut us free! Cut the nets! \nThe same cry is heard on all three boats. Leonard grabs an AXE and starts HACKING AWAY at the tow lines. \nJules and his deck hands do the same. WIRE SHEERS are brought out for the larger CABLES connected to the nets. Desperately they try and free themselves as their boats are dragged helplessly backwards. \nARTHUR (screaming at his men) Cut the damned cables! \nA CABLE SNAPS! \nJules falls backward as the cables and ropes are either cut or snapped from the pressure. Their boat stops. \nANOTHER CABLE SNAPS! \nLeonard and his crew TUMBLE to the deck as their boat is freed. \nTHE HARPO \nIs not so fortunate. The lone boat dragged backwards, faster now without the weight of the other boats. Then suddenly the aft of the boat begins to get PULLED DOWN, dipping into the water. \nWith an unstoppable force the Harpo gets PULLED UNDER WATER. Deck hands LEAP off the boat as the top cabin is CRUSHED as the entire ship slowly DISAPPEARS BENEATH THE SEA. \nFor a moment all is quiet. No one can believe what just happened. Hearts pounding, catching their breath. \nThen with a WHOOSH of air pressure, the Harpo BURSTS out of the water. With a gigantic SPLASH, the boat FLOPS on its side and capsizes. The waters calm, but the nerves of Jules and Leonard don't. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n27  EXT. CLOUDY SKIES - MILITARY TRANSPORT PLANE - DAY          27 \nA storm is brewing ahead as this large Military Transport plane glides into view then BANKS away. \nPETRI DISH \nA small piece of Nick's SAMPLE is cut away and placed on a glass microscope slide. \nWIDE TO REVEAL: \n28  INT. MILITARY TRANSPORT PLANE - SAME - DAY                  28 \nNick sits on the floor surrounded by his sloppily unpacked equipment as he places the slide under his microscope, examining his specimen. \nQuickly stepping over him a young SOLDIER rushes over to Major Hicks, seated with the rest of the team on the plane's opposing benches. The Solider interrupts their discussion. \nSOLDIER Major, we just got a report of a fishing trawler going down. Exact position, forty seven degrees latitude, 67 longitude. \nMAJOR HICKS What makes you think it's related? \nSOLDIER The trawler was pulled under. \nThe team exchanges worried glances. Hicks moves over to a map where the other incidents have been marked. He traces his finger up the 67th longitude until he hits the 47th parallel. Just off the East Coast. \nMAJOR HICKS Jesus Christ! It's only two hundred miles off the American Eastern seaboard and we don't even know what it is. \nELSIE Theropoda Allosaurus. Some type of enormous reptile the likes of which we haven't seen since the age of prehistoric dinosaurs. \nCLIVE (sarcastic) So where's been hiding the last sixty million years? \nELSIE The depth and breath of the ocean floor has barely been explored. His kind could have survived there completely undetected. \nNICK (O.S.) What about the traces of radiation? \nEveryone turns to discover Nick has walked over holding his loosely scribbled notes in his hand. \nThe man in the MARKET TRUCK is TOSSED and ENORMOUS TEETH puncture the top and bottom of his truck as it's LIFTED IN THE AIR. The man LEAPS from the open back of the truck. \nHe lands, HARD, down in front of one of the fish market stores as hundreds of fish RAIN DOWN from above. With a loud CRASH, the demolished truck SLAMS to the ground nearby. \n33  EXT. POLITICAL RALLY - BUILDING STEPS - RAIN - DAY          33 \nWith a large RE-ELECT MAYOR FAUSTINO poster behind him, the MAYOR is at the podium. Before him is a sea of umbrellas. \nMAYOR I'd like to thank you all for coming out on this beautiful New York City day. \nSome in the crowd laugh as others applaud. Lost in the sounds of the crowd we HEAR a soft THUMPING in the distance. \nMAYOR When I came into office four years ago, people didn't think we could reduce crime and I did. \nANGLE - COP IN BACK OF CROWD \nleaning to the cop next to him. \nCOP (sarcastic) Yeah, he did. \nMAYOR People didn't think I could restore order... \nThis time the THUMPING is HEARD, growing much louder. \nMAYOR ...and I did. The city is a safer place today... \nBefore he can continue the crowd begins to murmur with fear as the THUMPING grows LOUDER and CLOSER. Suddenly with a large CRASHING SOUND a building nearby begins to CRUMBLE. \nMAYOR (to his aides) What the hell.... \nPeople SCRAMBLE to get out of the way as DEBRIS from the falling BUILDING litters the area. The Mayor is pulled inside by his security men. \nBursting out of the crumbling corner of the building we SEE the enormous LEG of the reptile as it KICKS debris out of its way. \nSIDE ANGLE - WALL STREET - FAST TRAVELING SHOT \nSeveral cars are SQUASHED quickly as the enormous FEET of the beast STOMPS through the street. Cars FLATTEN and SCATTER, flipping toward us, from the weight of the beast. We try to keep up with it, but it's too fast. \nAfter it passes, the Mayor sticks his head out of the doorway to see the demolished street scene. \nMAYOR What was that? \n34  INT. WNEW - CAIMAN'S OFFICE - SAME - DAY                    34 \nCaiman's on the phone as his SECRETARY enters with some files. Rain and thunder continue outside. \nCAIMAN (into phone) I don't give a crap about some war in a country I can't pronounce. That's not a lead story. Find me a damned story, will ya! \nJust then his Secretary notices a desk lamp, the shade SHAKING and the light FLICKERING. She hears the THUMPING approaching. She turns and SEES... \nGIGANTIC TEETH \nThe enormous head of GODZILLA growls as it passes by Caiman's office window. \nSECRETARY Mr. Caiman. I think your story just walked by the window. \nCaiman turns but there's nothing there. He's confused, she's dazed. \nCAIMAN What? \nJust then the TAIL WHIRLS past with a THUNDERS whip. \n35  INT. DINER - SAME - DAY                                     35 \nAnimal, Lucy and Audrey are at the cashier paying. \nLUCY Did Romeo have a name? \nAUDREY Nick Tatopoulos. \nANIMAL That why you dumped him? \nAUDREY No! I just couldn't see myself with some boring egg head who spends his summer picking apart cockroaches. I wanted to have some adventure, some fun... \nLUCY And now you live the glamorous life of Caiman's assistant. Life's a bitch, ain't it? \nIn the distance we can HEAR the THUMPING approaching. \nANIMAL How long where you and dis guy goin' steady? \nAUDREY Nearly four years... \nLUCY Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him. \nAUDREY That's the problem. He did. \nSuddenly the THUMPING gets LOUDER very quickly. Everyone in the diner reacts. \nLUCY Tell me that's not another goddamned parade. \nThe next THUMP RATTLES the entire diner. Things begin to fall. Through the window we see people RUNNING in PANIC. \nANIMAL That's ain't no parade... \nBefore anyone can speak the entire building is SHAKING. Through the front window we SEE... \nGODZILLA'S FOOT \nSmashing down directly outside the window. Cars are SMASHED. One car SAILS directly INTO THE WINDOW, shattering it. \nSERGEANT (nervous) After the initial attack he just...disappeared. \nOFFICER (interrupting) Major, Secretary of Defense Burk on the line. \nThis takes Major Hicks off guard. The last person he wants to talk to. Nick walks over to the Sergeant. \nNICK I don't understand. How can something that large just disappear? \nSERGEANT We're not sure. We're scanning the area now. \nELSIE He probably returned to the river. Just like everywhere else we've been, we're always one step behind. \nNick turns and notices the back of the tent is open revealing a beautiful view of the Manhattan skyline. Several soldiers enter, setting up telescopes. \nNICK I don't think so. \nOver Manhattan we see several dark plumes of smoke from the destruction. Military helicopters scan the city. Staring out at the skyline, Nick is mesmerized. \nNICK I mean, look at it. It's perfect. An island, water on all sides. But like no other island in the world, this is a place where he can easily hide. (beat) He's in there someplace. \nA SOLDIER comes rushing in. \nSOLDIER Channel eight caught it on film! \nHe rushes over to a bank of monitors, turns one on. On the screen we SEE the shaky video Animal took of the creature just as it was about to step on him. \nCAIMAN (filtered) ...WNEW's exclusive images of the creature were taken less than a half hour ago. \nNick and Elsie's jaws nearly hit the floor at the sight of the immense creature. \nCAIMAN Cameraman Victor \"Animal\" Palotti barely survived this vicious attack to provide us with this footage. \nThe sounds of applause lead us to... \n42  INT. WNEW BUILDING - SAME - DAY                             42 \nEveryone is applauding as Animal, carrying crates of equipment, passes the t.v. playing the same news story. Embarrassed, Animal smiles awkwardly. \nCO-WORKERS Way to go Animal! That's my man! \nAnimal passes Audrey and Lucy who are packing up some files. \nAUDREY Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you scared? \nANIMAL Sure I was. I thought Lucy was gonna kill me. \nLUCY Damned right, you crazy Wop! \nWe SEE the room is in disarray from packing up cartons of boxes and equipment. The workers have taken a break from the packing as they watch the t.v. broadcast. The station manager, MURRAY enters anxiously. \nMURRAY People! We have to be completely relocated to the New Jersey station before our 5:30 broadcast. (reading from list) Okay, Caiman, Devoe and Animal, you're on the helicopter. Everyone else we'll see you in Jersey. \nANIMAL Gotta go, honey. You guys gonna be all right? \nLUCY Audrey's going to stay with us tonight. \nANIMAL Great. See ya then. \nAnimal hurries out after him. Audrey and Lucy go back to packing. Audrey looks up at the t.v. just as they replay the footage of Nick and Elsie being led into the command tent. \nFIELD REPORTER (filtered) ...military and government health officials set up a command post on the New Jersey coast this afternoon... \nSurprised at first, Audrey suddenly becomes very excited. She SEES Caiman exiting the studio at the end of the hall. She rushes over to him. \nAUDREY Caiman, wait. Take me with you. \nCAIMAN What? \nAUDREY I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military... \nCAIMAN Not now. You got my bag? \nAudrey holds up his bag as they walk towards the elevator. \nAUDREY You don't understand, I can get us information... \nCAIMAN Listen, this is the time when the big boys have to go to work, okay Honey? \nWith that, Caiman walks into the elevator. Pissed, Audrey just stares at him. \nCAIMAN The bag? \nAudrey THROWS the bag at him, knocking him backwards as the elevator doors close. Lucy walks over. \nLUCY Come on, Girl, we've gotta go! \n43  EXT. WNEW OFFICE BUILDING - MINUTES LATER - DAY             43 \nLucy and Audrey carry their bags outside into the chaos that has taken over the city. Hundreds of people trying to leave at once. Gridlock. \nAs they move into an overcrowded subway entrance, Audrey looks up just in time to SEE the WNEW NEWS HELICOPTER lifting off from the building behind them. \nCUT TO: \n44  EXT. MANHATTAN - HELICOPTER SHOT - LATE AFTERNOON           44 \nWe SEE the destroyed parts of downtown Manhattan. Police barricade the streets as firemen work to contain the fires. \nCAIMAN (O.S.) ...in what city officials are calling the worst act of destruction since the World Trade Tower bombing... \nWith that he gently pats the Mayor on the back, leaving a small, nearly undetectable DEVICE on the Mayor's collar. \nRAYMOND You can count on our emotional and financial support. \nMAYOR Oh, well, thank you very much. \nBriskly he shakes his hand as he pushes his way through the crowd. Raymond watches him pass, seeing the device stuck to the Mayor's collar. \nANGLE - WNEW NEWS CHOPPER \nRushing over from the parked news chopper, Animal and Caiman race for the Mayor who walks through a mob of reporters. \nCAIMAN Hurry, we're going to miss the Mayor. \nBut before he can get close, two POLICE OFFICERS stop them. \nPOLICE OFFICER Sorry, you gotta have a press ID past this point. \nCAIMAN Don't you watch t.v.? \nPOLICE OFFICER Can we see your press pass, sir? \nFlustered, Caiman searches his pockets for his press pass. \nCAIMAN I had one here on my bag. Where the hell did I put it? \nCAIMAN'S PRESS PASS - ECU \nWe SEE Caiman's plastic smile on his press ID. Suddenly AUDREY'S picture is placed on top of Caiman's. \nWIDEN TO REVEAL: \n57  INT. SUBWAY STATION - SAME - LATER AFTERNOON                57 \nSmashed together like sardines, Audrey plays with Caiman's press pass, trying to put her photo over his. \nLUCY What the hell are you doing? \nAUDREY Remember my friend we saw on t.v.? \nLUCY Your old sweetheart? \nAUDREY Yeah, well he just turned up in New Jersey at the military command post. Somehow all this is related to what happened down in Panama. There's a story here. I know it. You got any tape or glue? \nLUCY I left my forgery kit back at the office. \nAudrey looks over at a young ten year old boy holding his backpack, a RULER sticking out of the back. \nAUDREY Hey, do you have any glue in your bag? \nKID What's it to you? \nAUDREY Can I use some? \nKID What do I get? \nAUDREY The warm feeling of helping your fellow man. \nKID Five bucks. \nAUDREY You're kidding, right? \nThe Kid simply puts his hand out. \n58  EXT. NEW JERSEY TRAIN STATION - LATER                       58 \nPeople FLOOD off the train out into the station. \nP.A. ANNOUNCER Please exit the station. For those of you without accommodations, the city has opened up shelters on Monroe and 60th and at Bergenline and 72nd. Please exit the... \nAudrey and Lucy walk through the crowd. Audrey turns and gives Lucy a kiss. \nAUDREY Wish me luck! \nLUCY Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job. \nAUDREY I'm tired of waiting for someone else to give me an opportunity, Luce. If there's a story here I'm going to find it. \nLucy nods in acceptance as Audrey disappears into the dense crowd. Lucy worries for her friend. \nCUT TO: \n\"YUM YUM DOUGHNUTS\" BAG - PRE-SUNSET \nCarried along with a Styrofoam cup of coffee. We WIDEN TO REVEAL a MAN carrying the junk food to a GREY VAN parked not too far from the Command Center Tent across the way. \nThe man knocks on the back of the van. The van opens to reveal... \n59  INT. RAYMOND'S VAN - PRE-SUNSET                             59 \nFilled with high tech monitoring equipment, Raymond and his men are listening in to a conversation. The man with junk food hands it to Raymond. \nRAYMOND Merci. \nHe opens the bag and takes out a croissant. He bites into it and grimaces. To wash away the taste, he drinks from the coffee. It's worse than the croissant. \nRAYMOND You call this coffee? \nMAN (French accent) I call this America. \nFlopping on the ground is a large FISH. As the beam moves farther along we see two, no, three fish ahead. \nCUT TO: \n62  EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - POST-SUNSET (MAGIC HOUR)        62 \nA battalion of armored TANKS roll down this deserted city street. A large number of GROUND TROOPS march behind. \nCOBRA HELICOPTERS - SAME - MAGIC HOUR \nBanking in formation, the helicopters swerve, heading towards mid-town Manhattan. \nSAND BAG FORTIFICATION \nSoldiers pile up sand bags, creating a make shift fortification.

COMMAND TENT - SAME - MAGIC HOUR                       67 \nA buzz of activity. Military Officials and personnel. The Mayor enters and joins his aides in the back of the room. \nMAYOR (whispering to Aide) They find anything yet? \nThe Aide shakes his head. Monitors come to life with a live video feed-from several cameras we saw mounted. \nA CABLE REPAIRMAN - MAGIC HOUR \nIn blue overalls, the REPAIRMAN walks up to a large satellite dish. We WIDEN to REVEAL the dish is parked next to the Command Tent. He kneels down next to some cables leading away from the dish toward the Command Tent. \n68  INT.

MOTEL ROOM - SAME - MAGIC HOUR                         70 \nWe SEE Raymond and his men have turned this dingy Motel room into a command central of their own. Raymond is putting sugar into his coffee when a bank of monitors turn on. They are seeing THE SAME VIDEO FEED as the Mayor. Pleased, he takes a sip. It's awful. \nRAYMOND You said this was French Roast! \nHis aid turns, holding a package labeled FRENCH ROAST. \nRAYMOND (defeated) More cream. \nHis associate hands him some milk. He adds it to the coffee. No use, it still sucks. On the monitors we SEE the DUMP TRUCKS entering Flat Iron Square. \n71  EXT. FLAT IRON SQUARE - SAME - MAGIC HOUR                   71 \nThe DUMP TRUCKS arrive and the soldiers guide the trucks, forming a circle, their tails facing each other. As the last one passes it REVEALS Nick and Sergeant O'Neal. \nSERGEANT O'NEAL I sure hope your plan works. \nNICK I'm kind of hoping the same thing. \nThe twenty of them, in concert, begin to dump their cargo. \nLOW ANGLE - CENTER OF THE DUMP TRUCK CIRCLE \nTons and tons of FISH are DUMPED directly on top of us. \n72  INT. RAYMOND'S MOTEL - SAME - MAGIC HOUR                    72 \nOn the monitors they watch in astonishment as the fish get dumped into a large pile in the center of Flat Iron Square. \nAIDE Tres bizarre. \nRAYMOND No. (leaning forward) Very clever. \n73  EXT. FLAT IRON SQUARE - FISH PILE - SAME - NIGHT            73 \n99  EXT. AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS - SAME - NIGHT                  99 \nAs the remaining Cobra helicopter SWERVES around, Godzilla is gone. \nHELICOPTER PILOT #4 I don't know sir. He just vanished. \nAs the helicopter PASSES a dark building we SEE a SHAPE MOVE! We realize that like a chameleon, Godzilla had TAKEN THE COLOR of the building and hid. With the helicopter past him, he CHASES FROM THE REAR. \nHELICOPTER PILOT #4 (realizing) Oh Jesus! \nThe chopper GUNS IT, full throttle. Godzilla GIVES CHASE. Even at its top speed it can't out run the big creature. \nThe chopper tries to LIFT AWAY but before he can get the height, Godzilla SNAPS his gigantic jaws and SWALLOWS THE HELICOPTER WHOLE. \nSTREET - WIDE ANGLE \nThe fires burn and the rubble crumbles. Godzilla gives one final SCREAM and DIVES into a building, disappearing. \n100  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME - NIGHT                           100 \nThe Major's aide try to hold him back as the Mayor is charging at Major Hicks. \nMAYOR What the hell is the matter with you people?! You caused more damage than that thing did! \n101  EXT. 5TH AVENUE - SAME - NIGHT                             101 \nEmpty and devastated. Fires continue to burn. \n102  EXT. FLAT IRON SQUARE - SAME - NIGHT                       102 \nNick, Sergeant O'Neal and several of his men walk through the devastated area. Nick kneels down and SEES... \nNICK'S P.O.V. - PUDDLE OF BLOOD \nThere is a large reddish brown puddle of blood. Nick takes out a small glass container and scoops some up. \nSERGEANT O'NEAL I can't believe it. He did all this and we did nothing to him. \nNick walks over to him, consoling. \nNICK That's not true. We fed him. \nREVERSE ANGLE \nOnly a few scattered fish remain where the mountain of fish once was. Our team stands there amidst the rubble. \nFADE OUT: \nFADE IN: \n103  INT. NETWORK NEWS DESK - VIDEO FOOTAGE                     103 \nA network news ANCHOR speaks directly at us as a video of the Chrysler building getting destroyed plays behind him. \nANCHOR While it may have looked like Beirut, it was in fact, Manhattan where man and nature have collided with brute force. \nThe video switches to the White House where we SEE the President signing a bill. \nANCHOR The President today declared a state of emergency and has issued disaster relief funds to New York City. \nWIDEN TO REVEAL: \n104  INT. WNEW NEWS TRUCK - VIDEO FEEDS - SAME - NIGHT          104 \nWe SEE that we've been watching the video on one of MANY video monitors showing all the news broadcasts. As an assistant moves away from the monitors we FOLLOW him out of the truck. \n105  EXT. WNEW NEWS TRUCK - CONTINUOUS - SAME - NIGHT           105 \nWe continue to FOLLOW the assistant outside, revealing the enormous MOB of reporters that have gathered just outside the military command tents. As we FOLLOW the assistant he passes several reporters doing \"stand-up\" reports. \nREPORTER #1 ...rumors continue to mount as to the origin of this, perhaps, lost dinosaur... \nREPORTER #2 ...having shut down the United Nations in the evacuation, foreign diplomats are demanding an international coalition be assembled to track the creature... \nThe assistant finally arrives at Caiman who is doing a live remote. Animal works the camera. \nCAIMAN ...Maintaining a total media blackout, officials remain silent this evening as to their progress in containing this creature... \nBehind him, in the crowd we SEE Audrey pushing her way through the reporters, her fake ID pinned on her shirt. She turns and sees Caiman. Quickly she ducks down and moves deeper into the crowds. \nSuddenly there is movement as the crowd turns their collective attention over to a group of cars pulling up nearby. Audrey pushes her way to see what's happening. \nThe cars are BLOCKED from returning to the command tents as the reporters MOB the first car in line. \n106  INT. SEDAN - NICK - NIGHT                                  106 \nNick observes the chaos. Through the crowd he SEES a Pharmacy, a neon sign reading: Never Closes. He looks back down at the blood sample he holds in his lap and gets an idea. \nNICK (to the driver) It's okay, I'll get out here. \nHe opens the car door and pushes his way through the crowds who are less interested in him as they are the military officials. \nNICK'S P.O.V. - MEDIA CIRCUS - CROWDS - NIGHT \nPushing his way through, Nick SEES what a circus this has become; t.v. news camera crews, journalists, concerned citizens, worried mothers, and of course, merchandising... \nSTREET STANDS \nNick passes several vendors selling dinosaur toys, copies of Animal's now famous news video clip and, of course, tee shirts with still images from that same clip. \nAUDREY Are you sure? \nNick gets up and starts to gather his materials. \nNICK (thrilled) Well, obviously these tests weren't designed for this but fundamentally they're looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy. \nAUDREY I don't get it. If it's the first of its kind, how can it be pregnant? \nExcitedly Nick begins to pace. \nNICK The ultimate expression of evolution, it reproduces asexually. Think about it, all kinds of creatures have been known to travel great distances for reproduction. That's why he came to New York. Like every species of insufficient progenitors, he's nesting! \nAUDREY Nesting? \nNICK Yes. Do you realize that a creature like this could lay as many as a dozen eggs at a time! \nNick moves to the front exit of the tent. \nNICK Forgive me but I've got to get this into the lab, to confirm all this. I'll be right back. \nNick rushes from the tent. Alone, Audrey can't help but poke around a bit. She opens one of his CASES. Taped to the roof of the case she SEES... \nINSERT PHOTOS - NICK AND AUDREY \nHappy times long ago. They're both young and in love. Audrey is surprised Nick still keeps them. She's touched. \nFeeling guilty she quickly closes the case and sits back down. As she does she notices a video tape labeled FIRST SIGHTING. Unable to resist, she puts it in and turns on the t.v. The shot of the Japanese Cook appears. \nCOOK (filtered through t.v.) ...Gojira...Gojira... \nShe hits the fast forward tape and SEES, the enormous footprints in Panama. She fast forwards again and sees the beached cargo ship in Jamaica. \nAudrey is torn. She makes a decision, pops the tape back out, puts in her purse and takes off out the back of the tent. Moments later, Nick returns from the front. \nNICK Audrey? Audrey? \nA flash of lighting and thunder accents Nick's confusion. \nCUT TO: \n110  INT. EDITING BAY - LATER - DAWN                            110 \nOn two monitors we SEE Audrey doing a \"stand up.\" \nAUDREY (filtered) ...which is why in this case \"all the kings horses and all the kings men\" may not be able to put the big apple together again. Audrey Timmons, WNEW. \nWe pull back to reveal Audrey, Animal and an editor, ED, watching the piece. \nED That's it. You owe me a breakfast. \nAUDREY (turning to Animal) So, what do you think? \nANIMAL It's good. It's a real good piece. But how'd you get a hold of this material? \nAudrey covers her own mixed emotions. \nAUDREY Like you said, \"Good guys finish last.\" \nShe snatches the tape and she takes off running. Concerned and worried, Animal watches her leave. \nCUT TO: \n111  EXT. WNEW TRUCK - COMMAND TENT AREA - RAIN - DAWN          111 \nRushing out of the WNEW truck and into the rain, Audrey spots her Station Manager, Murray. In the b.g. we SEE Caiman getting make up, about to do a live spot with another cameraman. \nAUDREY Murray, I need you to look at this tape. \nMURRAY Not now, Audrey, we've about to go live with the morning report. \nAUDREY You're going to want to include this. I've got exclusive footage of other places this thing has attacked. \nMURRAY (suddenly interested) You do? Who's story is this? \nAUDREY Mine! \nANGLE - CAIMAN \nAbout to go on, Caiman waves off his make up artist as he watches Audrey hand Murray the tape. His field producer counts down to going live. \nP.O.V. THROUGH BINOCULARS - NICK - RAIN - MORNING \nThrough the lenses we SEE exiting his tent and moving on towards the large center command tent. We REVERSE to reveal... \n112  INT. RAYMOND'S MOTEL ROOM - SAME - RAIN - MORNING          112 \nOne of Raymond's men observes with binoculars from the window. Tucking his napkin into his lapel, Raymond eats breakfast with his men. Another man, JEAN-CLAUDE, listens at the monitoring equipment. He turns to Raymond. \nJEAN-CLAUDE Taisez-Vous. \nHe turns on the room speaker. \nMALE VOICE (filtered) ...Major Hicks, what makes you believe another attempt to gun that creature down will work? \n113  INT. COMMAND TENT - WAR ROOM - RAIN - SAME - MORNING       113 \nNick is moving to take his seat next to Elise at this very crowded conference. The big wigs are here and the room is packed. Major Hicks walks to a large map of Manhattan. \nMAJOR HICKS General Anderson, the problem was the terrain. If we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of Central Park... (points to the map) We should be able to take him down. \nMAJOR HICKS You gave them the tape? \nNICK No, it's still in my tent. It's...oh my God, she took it. \nPissed, GENERAL ANDERSON walks up to Nick. \nGENERAL ANDERSON Pack your stuff. You're officially off this project as of now. \n120  INT. DINER - SAME - MORNING                                120 \nCaiman is still on television, wrapping up. \nAUDREY He stole my report! That's my report! \nANIMAL We know, Audrey. \nCAIMAN (filtered) ...and in this reporter's opinion, \"all the kings horses and all the kings men\"... \nAudrey wads up her napkin and heaves it at the t.v. \nAUDREY Caiman you suck! \n121  INT. RAYMOND'S MOTEL ROOM - SAME - MORNING                 121 \nThe television is snapped OFF and Raymond walks over to the window looking out, thinking. Finally... \nRAYMOND We're leaving. \nCUT TO: \nA LARGE TRUNK \nSlams shut. More suitcases and trunks. Widen to reveal... \n122  INT. NICK'S TENT - LATER - DAY                             122 \nNick is finishing packing as some soldiers carry his things away. Elsie enters. \nELSIE I'm sorry about all this. \nNICK Me too. \nNick hoists his bag and moves to leave. \nNICK Make sure they find that nest before it's too late. \nELSIE I'll try. \nReluctantly Nick nods acceptance and exits out into the rain. We SEE the torn photographs of Nick and Audrey laying on the floor. \nELSIE Bye worm guy. \nCUT TO: \n123  INT. PHONE BOOTH - MOMENTS LATER - RAIN - DAY              123 \nAudrey in a street phone booth. \nAUDREY What do you mean Murray's not there? A second ago you told me he was on the other line... \nSomething catches Audrey's eye. \nAUDREY'S P.O.V. - THROUGH GLASS - NICK \nLugging his bags out into the rain, Nick moves over to a waiting cab. \n124  EXT. COMMAND TENT AREA - NICK & CAB - RAIN - DAY           124 \nLifting a heavy case, Nick places it into the cab's trunk. \nCABBY Where to? \nNICK Newark airport. \nAudrey moves up behind Nick. \nAUDREY You're leaving? Why? \nNick ignores her and continues to load the cab. \nAUDREY Is this cause of me? Because of the story? \nNICK Well what the hell did you think was going to happen? \nAUDREY You never said it was off the record. \nNICK I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're supposed to be my friend. I trusted you. \nAUDREY I didn't mean for it to turn out like this. (confessing) Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure. \nNICK So you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes? \nThe last bag stowed, Nick moves to get into the cab. He stops and turns back to her. \nNICK Good luck in your new career. I think you really have what it takes. \nHe gets in and slams the door. The cab takes off leaving a very alone Audrey standing in the rain. \nAUDREY (sad; to herself) I'm sorry. \nDoors slam and immediately boots march past. We WIDEN to reveal Raymond's team quickly gathering their gear and heading down the subway entrance. \nRaymond grabs a heavy bag and tosses it to Nick who nearly topples from the weight. \nRAYMOND Be careful with that. \nNick looks into the bag and sees a bag marked EXPLOSIVES. Shocked he looks back at Raymond, but he's gone. Nick regains his breath and follows. \nTHE FISH \nOlder and nastier, but the same fish we saw in the tunnel before. We FOLLOW the beam to its owner and find Nick. We WIDEN to reveal that we're.... \n140  INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT                 140 \nThe crisscrossing beams from the assault team's flashlights nearly blind us as Nick leads the team cautiously into the depth of this tunnel. Periodic fish are found along the way. Suddenly the faint HUMMING sound in the tunnel STOPS. \nEveryone freezes as the wind shifts direction. A familiar SMELL passes over them as they sniff the air. \nNICK They've turned off the ventilation system. They're calling him to dinner. \nRAYMOND Let's hope we are not the hors d'oeuvres. \nNervously they continue onward. \n141  EXT. 23RD STREET SUBWAY STATION - SAME - NIGHT             141 \nAnimal and Audrey arrive, spotting the assault team's vehicles. They head carefully down the stairs. \n142  INT. 23RD STREET SUBWAY STATION - SAME - NIGHT             142 \nAudrey and Animal, camera in hand shooting everything, climb down into the station. Animal rushes to the end of the platform and searches down into the tunnels. \nVIDEO P.O.V. - DARK TUNNEL - DISTANT LIGHTS \nThrough the camera we SEE the lights in the distance of the tunnel. \nANIMAL (whispering) They're down there. Let's go. \nAnimal jumps off the platform, down onto what's left of the tracks. Audrey squeamishly follows. \n143  INT. TUNNELS - NICK & TEAM - SAME - NIGHT                  143 \nNick kneels down to inspect some debris. An old SCREECHING SOUND is heard in the distance. Suddenly the ground begins to quake. Dust falling. The SCREECHING gets louder and louder. \nRaymond moves up to Nick and points ahead. Nick nods in nervous agreement. Just as they move towards the sounds the ENTIRE WALL OF THE TUNNEL COLLAPSES next to them. \nBursting through the tunnel wall GODZILLA appears. His enormous claws burrowing, he makes his way through and into the tunnel. Quickly he moves past the team. \nThe team DIVES into a cross tunnel just as the colossal beast BLASTS past them, barely missing them. \n144  INT. 23RD STREET SUBWAY STATION - TUNNEL ENTRANCE          144 \nAudrey and Animal have just gotten into the tunnel entrance. The entire place is shaking. Audrey is in a panic. \nAUDREY Animal, let's get out of here. \nBut Animal hoists his camera and starts filming as SOMETHING is moving TOWARDS them. Audrey is tugging at him as the shaking gets more violent. With all her strength, she finally gets Animal to start moving backwards. \nJust as they're out of the tunnel, the CREATURE BLASTS outward. Audrey and Animal DIVE into the maintenance ducks along side the tracks to avoid collision. \nANGLE - AUDREY AND ANIMAL \nAnimal is shielding Audrey with his body. She looks up just in time to SEE Godzilla CRAWLING UP and out through the ceiling. An amazing site. \nAUDREY Shoot! Shoot it! \nAnimal grabs his camera and gets the last moment of it disappearing from view. Once gone, they both break into enormous sighs of relief and nervous laughter. \n145  INT. TUNNEL - SAME                                         145 \nRecovering, Raymond and the team walk back into the main tunnel. They near the hole Godzilla just created, examining it. Nick climbs into the hole. \nNICK I guess we go this way. \nRaymond and his men follow. \n146  INT. COMMAND TENT - WAR ROOM - SAME - NIGHT                146 \nMajor Hicks is at the radio as the Generals sit behind him. \nMAJOR HICKS (into radio) Sergeant, status? \n147  INT. CENTRAL PARK - SAME - NIGHT                           147 \nThe park is bathed in light. Armed troops surround the area. Tanks and missile launchers are in place. Sergeant O'Neal kneels down by a sandbag fortification. \nSERGEANT O'NEAL (into radio) Any sign of it? \n148  EXT. ROOFTOP - SPOTTERS - SAME - NIGHT                     148 \nFrom the rooftop of one of the central park south high rises, a team of SPOTTERS scan the area. \nSPOTTER P.O.V. - THROUGH BINOCULARS - GODZILLA \nMoving steadily towards central park, Godzilla makes his way up seventh avenue. \nSPOTTER Got him. Section 5, heading north to target. \n149  EXT. CENTRAL PARK - SERGEANT O'NEAL - SAME                 149 \nANGLE - HALLWAY - ENTRY LEVEL - CONTINUOUS \nCautiously they move towards us. In the distance we see the rest of the team moving the other direction. Raymond and Nick arrive at a door leading to the main auditorium. Nick is about to push the door open when Raymond stops him. \nRAYMOND Jean-Claude. \nOn command, Jean-Claude snaps together his automatic rifle as Raymond pulls out his semi-automatic pistol. He nods \"okay\" to Nick who slowly opens the door. \nAs the door opens a small pile of FISH tumbles down over their feet. They step over the fish and enter. \n162  INT. AUDITORIUM - ENTRY LEVEL - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT         162 \nTotal darkness. Nick, Raymond and Jean-Claude cautiously step over the fish inside. Only their flashlight beams can be seen. \nNICK'S P.O.V. - TRASHED AUDITORIUM \nHis beam cruises over the area nearby. It's been gutted. Fish lay strewed on the floor everywhere. Suddenly Nick spots a strange cluster of OBJECTS. He moves closer. \nRaymond follows. With their combined light we can SEE... \nTHREE ENORMOUS EGGS \nA pile of reptile eggs nearly twice as tall as they are. Raymond walks behind the egg, illuminating it from the other side, making it partially translucent. We can SEE THE EMBRYO inside the egg and IT'S MOVING! \nNICK Three eggs. I thought there would be more. \nRAYMOND You were right. \nSlowly Nick turns and SEES what Jean-Claude is staring at open jawed... \nDOZENS OF EGGS \nTogether their beams of light scan across the main auditorium floor surrounding the gaping hole to discover DOZENS OF EGGS piled in clumps everywhere. \nNICK That can't be. That's got to be over twenty eggs. \n163  INT. OTHER HALLWAY - SAME - NIGHT                          163 \nAnother of Raymond's men (R-MAN #2) has found a switchboard, he examines the switches. \n164  INT. PENN STATION - SAME - NIGHT                           164 \nAnimal and Audrey are wandering through the debris. \nAUDREY Okay, where'd they go from here? \n165  INT. OTHER HALLWAY - SAME - NIGHT                          165 \nR-MAN #2 locates the switch he's looking for and hits it. \n166  INT. AUDITORIUM - SAME - NIGHT                             166 \nNick, Raymond and Jean-Claude are stunned as the work lights suddenly TURN ON illuminating the room, revealing... \nHUNDREDS OF EGGS \nAll over the main auditorium floor. A stunning tableau. Nick is speechless. Raymond turns to him. \nRAYMOND Start counting. \n167  INT. PENN STATION - SAME                                   167 \nThe light filters down from the gaping hole in the ceiling. \nANIMAL They must have climbed all the way up into there. \nTogether they notice some large metal piping that has fallen from the auditorium. They move over to it and begin to climb. \n168  EXT. UNDERWATER - HUDSON RIVER - NUCLEAR SUB - NIGHT       168 \nThe Arizona races past us. \n169  INT. COMMAND TENT - WAR ROOM - SAME - NIGHT                169 \nWe follow a runner who hands a report to the Admiral who is conferring with the General and Major Hicks by the schematic. The Admiral reads the report. \nADMIRAL JOHNSTON They've surrounded the target just at the mouth of the Hudson river. \n170  EXT.

UNDERWATER - GODZILLA - SAME - NIGHT                  172 \nThe torpedo is FIRED and comes darting directly at Godzilla who abruptly SWERVES. The torpedo, however, FOLLOWS him. \nANGLE - SUBMARINE - CALVIN COOLIDGE \nFrom the other direction, closing in. Godzilla DIVES, skidding close to the bottom. The TORPEDO begins to close the gap. \nRaymond turns and sees Nick, across the room studying a group of eggs. Raymond goes towards him. \nANGLE - AUDITORIUM FLOOR - HOLE - SAME \nCrawling out from the hole in the center of the floor, Animal and Audrey appear. They're stunned at what they see. Quickly Animal hoists his camera and begins to film as an amazed Audrey walks through. \nANGLE - NICK AND EGGS - MID-LEVEL DECK \nKneeling down along side the eggs, Nick examines them. Raymond approaches. \nRAYMOND Nick, we have a problem. \nNick silences him with a gesture as he moves in to listen to the egg. He leans his ear against the shell. Suddenly we HEAR a loud CRACK. Nick jumps backwards. \nThe shell RUPTURES and an large FISSURE opens up across the egg. As we hear other CRACKS O.S., Nick turns and SEES more eggs beginning to open all around them. \nANGLE - AUDREY AND ANIMAL - FLOOR LEVEL \nHidden in this forest of tall eggs, Animal leans in close to one getting video footage of it cracking. Audrey nervously watches. What she doesn't see, however, is a BABYZILLA, fish hanging from its jaw, as it approaches from behind. \nANGLE - NICK AND RAYMOND \nStunned, they can only stare as the BABYZILLA BREAKS FREE of his shell and gives a mini version of the famous WAIL. \nRAYMOND I think we should leave now. \nNICK Good idea. \nThe BABYZILLA kneels down and immediately starts GOBBLING UP the dead fish laying nearby. Cautiously Nick and Raymond slowly back away until they are a far enough distance, they they break into a run and head for the exit. \nANGLE - AUDREY AND ANIMAL - FLOOR LEVEL \nThe Babyzilla continues to chomp on its fish as it nears Audrey. Animal continues to shoot the cracking egg. \nANIMAL (whispered) One more second. This is fantastic. \nJust then Animal turns to SEE the Babyzilla right behind Audrey. \nAUDREY Don't you think we have enough? \nANIMAL Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough. \nAudrey turns to see what Animal is staring at. Her eyes go WIDE as she backs up into Animal. Another BABYZILLA appear on the other side of them. \nANIMAL Just be calm. Don't startle them. \nAnimal leads Audrey backwards as they make their way towards the large \"team\" entrance at the end of the floor. The two Babyzillas swallow their fish and begin to SNIFF the air. \nAudrey moves up the isle. An egg CRACKS and an ARM breaks out through a shell, GRABBING HER LEG. Audrey FREAKS and frantically she KICKS herself free. They both suddenly take off running. \n189  INT. MID-LEVEL HALLWAYS - SAME                             189 \nNick and Raymond race to the stairwell. Raymond pulls out his radio. \nRAYMOND (into radio) Everyone, outside! Now! \nANGLE - JEAN-CLAUDE - MID-LEVEL DECKS - ACROSS THE ROOM \nLaying down the plastic explosives. Hearing the radio, he drops what they're doing just as several eggs near them begin to CRACK. Quickly he and his partner take off running. \n190  INT. FAR BACK WALL - LOWER LEVEL - SAME                    190 \nTwo other men are still laying cables for the explosives. One of them is kneeling in a pile of FISH near the eggs. \nR-MAN #2 Come on, let's go. \nR-MAN #3 One moment. I've almost got this. \nJust then a BABYZILLA pops up behind the eggs, a fish in his mouth. He SWALLOWS the fish and begins SNIFFING THE AIR. He turns and stares directly at the slowly retreating R-MAN #3. \nHe smells his own hands and realizes he smells like fish, quickly he turns and RUNS. \nBut Babyzilla is faster. He runs up from behind and LEAPS onto R-MAN #3's back. R-MAN #2 begins to FIRE at Babyzilla just as another one TACKLES HIM from the side. \nIn moments, they are both devoured. \n191  INT. TEAM ENTRANCE - FLOOR-LEVEL - SAME                    191 \nAudrey and Animal reach the entrance and race inside. The main exit doors are locked from the outside. They turn back just as... \nTHREE BABYZILLAS \nappear in the team entrance doorway SNIFFING THE AIR. Audrey SEES something, grabs Animal's wrist and pulls him to one of the Locker room doors. It's open. \n192  INT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS                              192 \nThrough the door we SEE the Babyzilla approaching as Audrey and Animal leap inside, slamming the door behind them. There is a sudden THUD against the door. \nAnimal rushes over to a large LOCKER CABINET and, with all his strength, PUSHES it over, blocking the door. \nAUDREY Great. Now what do we do? \n193  INT. HALLWAYS - MID-LEVEL - SAME                           193 \nNick and Raymond run up to another open doorway and look inside. \nNICK'S P.O.V. - AUDITORIUM \nDozens and dozens of eggs HATCHING. BABYZILLAS everywhere begin to awaken and immediately begin to devour all the fish. A Babyzilla appears only feet away and turns and stares directly at us. \nHis brothers ATTACK.

HALLWAY - MAIN LOBBY LEVEL - SAME                     200 \nNick comes racing down the stairs and into the hallway. Just then, he passes a locked door, BANGING on the other side. \nJust up ahead he can SEE the main lobby. But before he can get there, a LOUD CRASH is heard as the locked door in front of him SMASHES TO BITS as... \nDOZENS OF BABYZILLAS \nFlood into the main lobby only a few yards ahead. Nick slams on the breaks and quietly tries to back away. He turns to run the other directions when... \nMORE BABYZILLA \nCome BURSTING THROUGH the locked door behind him. Pinned down with no way out. Nick SEES the elevator nearby and races over, slamming his hand against the button. \nNICK Come on, come on. \nThe Babyzillas by the front door spot Nick. A couple of them start to SNIFF THE AIR and start to move towards him. Behind, the Babyzilla also catch the scent and turn. \nNICK This is not good. \nJust then the elevator doors open, Nick LEAPS inside. \n201  INT. ELEVATOR - SAME                                       201 \nNick frantically pushes the CLOSE DOOR button but it's painfully slow to react. \nNICK I hate these things! \nJust then the Babyzillas appear. They're just about to move in when the doors finally CLOSE. Nick breaths a sigh of relief just as a loud THUD is heard as one of them SLAMS against the door. It's too late, the elevator begins to rise. \n202  INT. AIR VENT - SAME - NIGHT                               202 \nClimbing upward, Animal reaches a plateau and crawls into cross vent. He reaches back and grabs his camera. Putting it down he turns back and helps Audrey up and in. \nANIMAL You okay? \nOut of breath, she nods. Animal takes the lead again, pushing his camera in front of him. He reaches another vent that looks down. He's about to pull it free when something catches his eye. \nANIMAL'S P.O.V. - THROUGH VENT - RAYMOND \nStanding guard, automatic rife in hand, Raymond appears with his back toward us. Animal lifts his camera to shoot. \nAUDREY (whispered) What? What is it? \nAnimal doesn't answer, he just shoots. \n203  INT. HALLWAY - SAME                                        203 \nThe elevator doors open and Raymond SWERVES his gun around ready to shoot. Frightened, Nick throws his hands in the air. \nNICK Hey, it's me! \n204  INT. VENT - SAME                                           204 \nAudrey has pushed her way up alongside of Animal to peer down through the grating. \nRAYMOND What happened? \n205  INT. HALLWAY - SAME                                        205 \nNick keeps dialing the cell phone, still busy. \nNICK They're loose. They're allover the main lobby. I couldn't get out. \nJust then the vents above COLLAPSES and Animal and Audrey come tumbling down. In a flash, Raymond has his weapon trained on their heads. \nRAYMOND Who the hell are you? \nNICK It's okay. I know her. \nRaymond turns his gun towards the fallen video camera and FIRES, ripping the camera apart. \nANIMAL Hey! What gives? \nRAYMOND No cameras. \nNick moves to Audrey's side, helping her up. \nNICK What are you doing here? \nAUDREY I thought you said there'd only be a dozen eggs. \nNICK I was wrong. \nJust then a LOUD THUMP is heard against the near locked door. The THUMPING gets louder and heavier. \nRAYMOND Do you have a radio, a walkie-talkie? Anything we can use to contact the outside. \nAUDREY What about the phones? \nNICK Circuits are overloaded. \nAUDREY (gets an idea) I know a way. I know how you can get a message out of here. \nThe door BURSTS OPEN and TWENTY BABYZILLAS stampede into the hallway. Audrey is fast on her feet. \nAUDREY This way. \nAUDREY We're live from inside Madison Square Garden where Dr. Niko Tatopoulos has discovered the beasts lair. Doctor, tell us what is happening here. \nAnimal swerves the camera over to Nick. Raymond stays back behind the camera, watching. \nNICK We've discovered over two hundred eggs which began hatching only moments ago. \n216  INT. LUXURY BOXES HALLWAY - SAME                           216 \nThe creatures come bursting out of the stairwell and flood into the hall. Sniffing around they pick up the scent and take off. \n217  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME                                   217 \nA Soldier tugs on Major Hicks shoulder, try to get his attention. \nMAJOR HICKS What is it? \nSOLDIER You better see this. \nThe Major turns around just in time to SEE Nick on the t.v. \nNICK If the military are listening, they must immediately destroy this building before they can escape. \nAUDREY (O.S.) Oh my God! They're coming! \nThe camera SWERVES to SEE through the luxury booths across from them, the dozens of Babyzillas approaching. \n218  INT. LUCY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - SAME                     218 \nThe bedroom is packed with Lucy's \"guests\" as they watch the t.v., SEEING the Babyzillas. \nLUCY Oh my God! \nOn the screen the image turns to Nick. \nNICK (filtered) If those creatures escape and multiply, in a very short time a new species will emerge. One that could replace us as the dominant species of this planet. \n219  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME                                   219 \nMajor Hicks is on the phone. \nMAJOR HICKS (into phone) That's correct, I want you to blow up Madison Square Garden. No I'm not drunk. (to O'Neal) Contact the news station. Tell them we're on the way. \n220  INT. BROADCAST BOOTH - SAME - NIGHT                        220 \nRaymond spots a large spool of co-axle cable. Quickly he ties it to the support beam. \nAUDREY Reporting live from Madison Square Garden, this is Audrey Timmonds, WNEW. \n221  INT. AUDREY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - SAME                   221 \nEveryone is breathless watching the news. Lucy beams. \nLUCY That's my girl. \n222  INT. BROADCAST BOOTH - SAME                                222 \nAnimal lowers the camera and everyone is silent. \nNICK Thanks, Audrey. \nThe computer beeps, Animal reads the message. \nANIMAL The good news is they got the message. The bad news is we've got five and a half minutes to get out of the building. \nSuddenly the room ROCKS as the Babyzillas begin crashing against the blocked door. Raymond jumps to his feet. \nRAYMOND Okay, party's over. Time to leave. \nWith that he SPRAYS bullets into the front glass window SHATTERING IT. Glass rains down below. Raymond tosses the spool of cable out the broken window. \nRAYMOND Anyone care to join me? \nAnimal dislodges one of the video cameras, hoists it on his shoulder and moves over to join Raymond. \n223  EXT. AIR BASE - F-18 SQUADRON - SAME - NIGHT               223 \nSeveral F-18's prepare to take flight. We focus on one, an enormous bomb attached under its wing. The F-18 taxis away from us. \n224  INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - AUDITORIUM - SAME             224 \nRepelling down from the broken window of the broadcast booth, Animal and Raymond land on the upper-level balcony. Raymond signals to the others to follow. \n225  INT. BROADCAST BOOTH - SAME                                225 \nAudrey and Nick are nervous as they stare at the long drop down. The door is begging to give way from the repeated THUMPING. Suddenly Audrey leans over and kisses Nick. \nAUDREY In case I can't later. \nWith that she JUMPS out, repelling downward. Nick is stunned by the unexpected kiss. Suddenly the door GIVES and the Babyzilla FLOOD into the room. Nick jumps. \n226  INT. AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS                               226 \nAudrey hits the ground followed by Nick. Raymond leads as they make their way out. \nOn the other end of the room some Babyzilla appear in a doorway and watch our friends scurry away. The Babyzillas take off in hot pursuit. \n227  INT. DARK SKIES - F-18 SQUADRON - NIGHT                    227 \nThe F-18's fly in formation. Their leader carrying the same bomb we saw loaded earlier. \nAUDREY Really? I'd like to find out. \nShe hugs him tightly. Nick smiles. Animal turns to Raymond who has cut above his eye. \nANIMAL Hey Man, you all right? \nRAYMOND I could use a coffee. \nWe begins to pull away from this tableau, slowly lifting upwards when suddenly... \nTHAT FAMOUS WAIL \nIs heard! Then, violently BURSTING up through the ashes, a very angry GODZILLA emerges! \nBleeding from his injuries, Godzilla leans down and nuzzles the burned out remains of his young. For the first time in the film we can SEE a partial expression of Godzilla's face; pain. \nBut quickly that pain turns to burning anger as he focuses his hatred downwards, staring directly, and accusingly, at our heroes. \nNICK Ohhhhhhhh.....shit. \nANIMAL What do we do? \nRAYMOND Running would be a good idea. \nAnd they do just as Godzilla POUNCES. Fortunately our team DARTS around a corner just in time. \n238  EXT. SIDE STREET - SAME                                    238 \nAs our heroes come rushing around a corner, Godzilla BURSTS THROUGH the building in front of them, sealing off their exit. Raymond notices a very narrow alley. \nANGLE - ALLEY WAY \nRaymond leads them through this slim alley between to large brick buildings. They run for their lives as Godzilla appears behind them. \nHis claws are too big to reach into the alley so he BULLDOZES his way into it, the building ripping apart as he marches forward. \nBricks go FLYING as debris showers down on our team just they make their way to the other side. \nSlowed down by the the position of the alley, Godzilla SWINGS his arms violently to clear a path. \n239  EXT. 29TH STREET - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                      239 \nRacing from the alley Raymond races over to a parked YELLOW CAB. \n240  INT. CAB - CONTINUOUS - SAME                               240 \nIn one deft move, Raymond draws a screwdriver out of his belt, pops the ignition device off the steering column and hot wires the car in under 15 seconds. It's amazing. \nAs he does this the others pile into the car. Not even completely all in, Raymond takes off as soon as the engine turns over. Animal nearly falls out. \n241  EXT. 29TH STREET - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                      241 \nJust as GODZILLA bursts out from between the buildings the CAB DARTS away, squealing around the next corner. \n242  EXT. 8TH AVENUE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                       242 \nPower sliding around the wet street corner, the Yellow Cab FISHTAILS onto 8th Ave. Whipping around the corner behind them Godzilla appears. \nAs he's MUCH faster, he nearly overtakes the car in a single LEAP but the cab SWERVES AGAIN moving down another street. \n243  EXT. 27TH STREET - SAME                                    243 \nThe cab darts onto 27th street.

LEWELLEN DRIVE - SAME                                 245 \nUsing this small cut-across, the cab quickly exits out onto the next main street (28th).

CAB - SAME                                            246 \nAnimal fumbles with his camera trying to get it to power up. The light goes ON and Animal quickly holsters it and begins filming out the shattered back window. \nAUDREY Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut up Broadway. \nANIMAL You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK. \nAUDREY The JFK? In the rain!? \n247  EXT. STREET - CAB & GODZILLA - NIGHT                       247 \nLEAPING forward, Godzilla BITES down, SNAPPING at the cab as it SWERVES just out of danger, gunning it. \n248  INT. CAB - SAME - NIGHT                                    248 \nANIMAL What are you talking about? The east side is always faster. \nAUDREY But we can get to the west side faster. \nThrough the rear window we SEE Godzilla SNAPPING down trying to take a bite. The cab, again, SWERVES wildly, darting down a side street. \nRAYMOND Somebody make up your mind! \nAUDREY & ANIMAL Take central park! \n249  EXT. 8TH AVENUE - SAME                                     249 \nThe cab SPINS, pulling a full 180 degree turn, and PEELS OUT just before Godzilla can SNAP DOWN again, just missing the cab. \nThe cab PEELS around the creature and UP THE ONRAMP. \nJust then Godzilla LEAPS AFTER THEM. His jaw open, he BITES DOWN ON THE CAB. \n263  INT. CAB - CONTINUOUS                                      263 \nEveryone ducks as the enormous JAWS OF THE CREATURE CLAMP DOWN OVER THE CAB. \n264  EXT. EXIT RAMP - SAME                                      264 \nTaking a gigantic BITE out of the highway, some high tension wires and the support structure over the bridge, Godzilla CHOMPS DOWN on the cab. \nThe large cement SIGN SLAMS into the roof of the creature's mouth, preventing him from crushing the cab with his teeth. \n265  INT. GODZILLA'S MOUTH                                      265 \nThe sign supports will not hold much longer as it crumbles just above the cab. The torn electric cables DANGLING dangerous close to the cab. \nGodzilla PUSHES his TONGUE towards the back of the car, trying to draw it into his throat! \n266  INT. CAB                                                   266 \nThey're freaking out as the jaws are closing in on them. \nAUDREY Gun it! Gun it! \nRAYMOND I'm trying! \nC.U.

HIGHWAY - GODZILLA - SAME                             267 \nLike a dog with a bone, Godzilla SHAKES his head trying to rip the rest of the highway free. The portion of highway in front of the cab TEARS FREE, lifting. \n268  INT. GODZILLA'S MOUTH                                      268 \nFrom the cab we SEE the horizon LIFT as the road begins to give way. The sign above CRUMBLING FURTHER. \nNick turns and SEES... \nELECTRIC CABLES - SPARKS \nSparking as they hit against the supports of the sign, Nicks sees the cables dangling close to the cab. He takes off his jacket, wraps it around his hand and opens the cab door. \nGrabbing the cable with his wrapped hand, he JAMS THE CABLE DOWN into Godzilla's TONGUE. SPARKS FLY! Nick leans back inside, slamming the door shut. \n269  EXT. HIGHWAY - GODZILLA                                    265 \nHe temporarily opens his mouth wider with a scream just before he is about to SLAM his jaws shut again... \nC.U. TIRES - SUDDENLY CATCHING \nAs the tongue momentarily retreats from the SHOCK, the wheels CATCH and the CAB LURCHES FORWARD. \n270  EXT. GODZILLA - CONTINUOUS                                 270 \nAs the sign CRUMBLES and the JAWS CRUSH DOWN, the cab SAILS OUT OF HIS MOUTH as the beast SWALLOWS the piece of highway. \nLanding, hard, onto the pavement, the cab PEELS OUT, burning rubber as it enters the George Washington Bridge. \nGodzilla SWALLOWS only to realize he didn't get them. Seeing the cab on the bridge Godzilla gives chase. \n271  EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE                              271 \nThe cab races towards us when Godzilla STEPS ONTO THE BRIDGE. His enormous weight makes the entire bridge WOBBLE. \nThe Cab goes airborne then bottoms out as it returns to the asphalt as the bridge undulates beneath them. It's as though they were driving during an earthquake. \nWith each stride Godzilla takes, the bridge becomes more unstable. \n272  EXT. SKIES ABOVE THE HUDSON - F-18'S - SAME                272 \nSwooping down the F-18's head directly towards the bridge. We see Godzilla about to overtake the Cab. \n273  INT.

Murray wants these copied to each field producer... \nANGLE - SECRETARY DESK \nStanding in front of the desk is AUDREY TIMMONDS, early thirties, attractive, small town girl who still hasn't toughened in the big city and talking with her co-worker, LUCY, sitting. \nAUDREY And I'm supposed to remind you to call him on all of Caiman's expense p.o.'s. \nLUCY Speak of the devil. \nJust then Caiman passes behind them. \nAUDREY (nervous) Think I should ask him?

Lucy rolls her eyes. \nLUCY Oh girl... \nANGLE - CAIMAN \nAs he walks towards his office Audrey races up to him. Seeing her, he walks faster hoping to avoid her. He can't. \nAUDREY Did you talk with Humphries? \nCAIMAN This is not the place... \nAUDREY Just tell me, did you talk with him? \nCAIMAN He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez. \nAUDREY Are you serious? He's going to consider me for he job? What else did he say? \nThey arrive at his office. An enormous standee of himself with the ACTION NEWS CREW is there. \nCAIMAN Why don't I tell you over dinner tonight? Your place. \nHe stops at his door. Audrey is startled. \nAUDREY Mr. Caiman, you're married. \nCAIMAN And you're beautiful... \nAUDREY Mr. Caiman... \nCAIMAN Call me Charlie. \nAUDREY (stubbornly) Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year.

Two gigantic holes, ripped into its hull. \nMILITARY JEEPS \nNick hops out and joins Major Hicks et al as they push past the gathered crowd of onlookers. The group gives a collective gasp as they see the ship for the first time. \nThree men (who we'll recognize from the Tahiti hospital) take measurements of the holes in the ship. \nMAJOR HICKS Who are they? Lieutenant, get those people away from there. \nRAYMOND (French accent) They are with me! \nEveryone in the group turns to find Mr. Phillip Raymond. \nMAJOR HICKS And who are you? \nRaymond hands him, as well as anyone who wants one, his business card. \nRAYMOND CHARGEURES, property and casualty insurance.

CARGO HULL - CONTINUOUS - DAY                          22 \nInside is eerily dark and creepy. The guts of the ship are tangled inside. Holding a Geiger counter, he gets readings from all over the area. One particular spot, above him, seems slightly stronger. \nNick SEES something there. He opens his knapsack and puts on some rubber gloves, removing a glass jar (like the ones from Chernobyl) \nCarefully he climbs the debris until he reaches a sharp shard of metal. Clinging to it he finds a MEATY CHUNK OF REPTILE FLESH. \nHe tries remove it but he only gets half. He places it into his jar. Just as he reaches for the other half, SOMETHING GIVES WAY. \nWith a JOLT, the section above him collapses. A rush of water falls and a HUMAN BODY swings down, just in front of him. \nNick tumbles backwards, his heart pounding. The body swings lifelessly as it hangs from above. \nThe others rush to his side, checking to see if he's all right. \nPETERS You okay, Nick? \nNICK Yeah, I'm...wait...I lost... \nNick looks around frantically when the glass sample jar is suddenly handed to him. \nRAYMOND Are you looking for this? \nNICK Thanks. \nRaymond studies Nick as he joins the rest outside. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nUNDERWATER - NETS - MOVING P.O.V. \nWe are moving very quickly underwater.

Each with a team manning enormous mounted weaponry. \nREVERSE ANGLE - 6TH AVE. - GODZILLA \nGalloping like a Gisele uptown, Godzilla is SPEEDING up the boulevard. The armored vehicles OPEN FIRE. Some shots CLIP into Godzilla's back. Ahead he is running directly into... \nMOBILE MISSILE LAUNCHERS \nBlocking off the street in front of him. They FIRE. Pinned down, the creature SCREAMS and DUCKS away down another side street. The missiles can't turn fast enough and SLAM into a building, DEMOLISHING it. \n90  EXT.

Finally... \nRAYMOND I am a patriot. I love my country. Can you understand that? \nNICK Sure. \nRAYMOND It is my job to protect my country. Sometimes I must even protect it from itself. From mistakes we have made. Mistakes that we do not want the world to know about. \nNICK Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific. \nRAYMOND Yes. This testing done by my country left a terrible mess. We are here to clean it up. \n129  EXT. WAREHOUSE - ANIMAL - SAME - RAIN - AFTERNOON          129 \nMoving down alongside the building, Animal walks down the side alley. He climbs up onto a garbage hamper and peers into a cracked opened window. \nANIMAL'S P.O.V. - WAREHOUSE \nAnimal sees Nick and Raymond with all the hardware. Several of the men are repainting the vehicles to resemble those of the US Army. \n130  INT. WAREHOUSE - SAME                                      130 \nNick walks past the myriad of warfare tools.

We just do not know where to start looking. \nNick moves closer to the map, putting his finger on the Flat Iron square subway station. \nNICK Here. 23rd street subway station. Where we first found the fish. With a little luck, this will lead us right to it. \nRAYMOND So you're in? \nNICK Are you kidding? I always wanted to join the French Foreign Legion. \nCUT TO: \n131  INT. LUCY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER - LATE AFTERNOON    131 \nAnimal quickly climbs the stairs. People are everywhere.

APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS - LATE AFTERNOON               132 \nFilled with people, Lucy is serving coffee. She smiles at Animal as he enters. \nANIMAL Who the hell are all these people? \nLUCY What? I just couldn't just let them sleep in the street. \nANIMAL Where's Audrey? \nLUCY In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you. \nANIMAL What? \nLUCY All that \"you gotta be vicious\" stuff you filled her head with. \nANIMAL Me!? You where the one... \nLUCY Go in there. Talk to her. \nLucy pushes Animal towards the back bedroom. \n133  INT. BEDROOM - SAME - LATE AFTERNOON                       133 \nAudrey has been crying. Crumpled Kleenex wads piled up all around her. A television plays a news broadcast, boasting the headline: THEY CALL HIM GODZILLA! On the t.v. we SEE a news conference with General Anderson addressing some reporters. \nREPORTERS (simultaneously) Can you comment on the nest? How many more of these things will there be? \nGENERAL ANDERSON (filtered) That's why I'm holding this conference. To try and avoid a needless panic. \nAnimal enters and watches from the back of the room. \nGENERAL ANDERSON Contrary to some frivolous reports, we have no information to lead us to believe that there are any eggs of the creature in the city. \nAUDREY Stupid idiots! \nANIMAL You okay? \nAUDREY It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this. \nANIMAL You made a mistake. \nSuddenly someone exits the bathroom and crosses out of the room. Animal looks at the stranger as he leaves. \nAUDREY Yeah, I just screwed up with the only man who ever really cared about me. \nANIMAL Didn't you tell me he left for the airport? \nAUDREY Yeah. Why are you asking? \nANIMAL I just saw him. He's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight. \nAudrey tries to make sense of this. Suddenly she realizes. \n", "test3_true": "ANIMAL Perfect! You wanted a story, well, baby, you got one. \nExcitedly Animal goes to the closet and retrieves a big overcoat. \nAUDREY Animal, I can't. \nANIMAL Look, you want to make it up to your friend? Well if he's right, this is your chance. \nHe starts going through his drawers, taking out battery packs, tapes, etc, and putting it in his pockets. \nAUDREY (misgivings) I don't know. I've already made such a mess of things... \nAnimal walks up to the door, ready to exit. \nANIMAL (smiling) Audrey, I'm going after them. You can come with me or not. \nConflicted, Audrey is not sure what to do. Animal opens the bedroom window and begins to climb out. \nAUDREY What are you doing? \nANIMAL Lucy'd kill me if she knew. \nCUT TO: \n134  INT. WAREHOUSE - LATER - SUNSET                            134 \nNick marches out of a changing room dressed in a military uniform. As he moves into the room we SEE all of Raymond's men dressed similarly. \nAs they climb into their vehicles, Raymond hands each a stick of chewing gum. Nick gets in the passenger seat of one of the vehicles, Raymond climbs in behind the wheel. \nNICK What's with the chewing gum? \nRAYMOND Makes us look more American. \nNick looks over at the faux Americans. It's a tough sell, gum or not. \nNICK Just let me do all the talking. \nWith that the vehicles pull out of the warehouse and out into the rainy night. \n135  EXT. LINCOLN TUNNEL - ENTRANCE - RAIN - SUNSET             135 \nAn armed blockage seals the Jersey entrance to the Lincoln tunnel. We widen to reveal Audrey and Animal by a small side entrance. Animal works the lock. \nAUDREY What are you doing? \nANIMAL It's the maintenance entrance. Runs along the side of the tunnel. When they repaired it last year I worked on a piece about it. \nJust then the lock TURNS and the door opens. They enter. \n136  EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE - JERSEY SIDE - SUNSET       136 \nA line of military vehicles approaches and slowly passes through a guarded entrance, each vehicle checked. Nick and Raymond's Humvee nears. \nANGLE - GUARDED BLOCKADE - CONTINUOUS \nRaymond's Humvee rolls up and a GUARD walks up to the window. \nGUARD (checking clipboard) Who you boys with? \nNICK Oh, we're with the three two. \nGUARD I didn't ask you, soldier. \nNICK Sergeant O'Neal just called down for us to join in. \nNow he's suspicious. The guard approaches Raymond, checks him out. \nGUARD You got a problem talkin'? \nRAYMOND (perfect southern accent) Why no sir, I'm fine. \nThe Guard is suspicious but on a tight schedule. Finally he waves him through. \nGUARD All right, keep it moving. \nRAYMOND (ala Presley) Thank you very much. \nThey drive off. Nick is stunned by the act. \nRAYMOND Elvis Presley movies. (by way of explanation) He was the King! \n137  INT. LINCOLN TUNNEL - MAINTENANCE DOOR - SAME - NIGHT      137 \nThe door creeps open. Animal leans out to find the tunnel deserted. He and Audrey step out and into the tunnel. We FOLLOW them as they are headed for the exit of the tunnel into Manhattan. \n138  INT. RAYMOND'S HUMVEE - NIGHT                              138 \nRaymond and Nick drive through Central Park. We can SEE dozens of military people and vehicles in a large meadow. \n139  EXT. CENTRAL PARK - LARGE MEADOW - NIGHT                   139 \nThe enormous pile of fish is getting dumped in the center of the field as many others are planting land mines. Tanks, rockets and soldiers align the area. \nThe convoy of vehicles turn onto the meadow but Raymond and his men keep going straight. They drive slowly right past the trap sight and out of the park. \nTIRES SQUEALING TO A STOP \n", "test3_id": 1073}

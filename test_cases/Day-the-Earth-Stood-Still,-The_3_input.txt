A couple of engineers are working feverishly over a huge and complicated control panel. They are working by the light of two incongruous and ineffectual candles. 
INT. NEW YORK SUBWAY KIOSK 
People carne pouring up the stairs wildly, feverishly anxious to escape the darkness below. Their eyes blink weakly in the unaccustomed sunlight. 
EXT. SHOT - NEW YORK STREET 
Cars, taxis and busses are stalled, their frenzied drivers unable to figure out what's happened. A junk peddler with a broken-down horse and wagon moves grandly and leisurely through the stalled vehicles. The peddler bears a happy grin of superiority. This is his moment of triumph over modern civilization.

of two cab drivers whose taxis have stalled beside each other in traffic. One has gotten out of his cab. The other is seated at his wheel, looking around in awe and terror, his tough Manhattan heart shaken.

INT. BARNHARDT'S STUDY - DAY 
Barnhardt is seated comfortably at his desk with a book on his lap. He has been interrupted by the entrance of Hilda, his secretary. At the moment she`s beside herself with excitement. Barnhardt watches her with a half-smile of secret amusement. He has already deduced the cause of what's happening. 
HILDA You should see it, Professor Barnhardt! You should go out and see it for yourself! 
BARNHARDT Thanks -- I'm enjoying it right here. 
HILDA The whole city has stopped. People are running around like ants! 
BARNHARDT (musing admiringly on Klaatu's cleverness) What a brilliant idea. I never would have thought of it. 
Hilda flings him a questioning look, annoyed that he won't share her excitement. 
BARNHARDT What about the people who are coming to the meeting tonight? Have they all arrived? 
HILDA (nodding) I talked to most of them this morning... They were all very curious about the meeting. 
BARNHARDT Good. Did you speak to our friend Mr. Carpenter? 
HILDA (nodding) He'll be there at 8:30. 
BARNHARDT (studying her for a moment) Tell me, Hilda -- does all this frighten you -- does it make you feel insecure? 
HILDA Yes, sir -- it certainly does! 
BARNHARDT (nodding with a bland little smile) That's good, Hilda. I'm glad.

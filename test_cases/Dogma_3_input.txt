INT BASEMENT 
Our heroes cower beneath the floor door. 
JAY 
What is that thing? 
SERENDIPITY 
You ever hear of Golgotha? 
BETHANY 
Skull place. The hill where Christ was crucified. 
SERENDIPITY 
(peering above) 
Yeah, well it wasn't just Christ up there - the Romans crucified everybody on that hill. Ahd Christ excluded, they were all criminals - killers, brigands, thieves, rapists. And whenever the crucified expired, their bodies would naturally lose muscle control, spilling bowel and bladder in the process. And the result is that walking pile of crap up there: the Golgothan Shit-Demon - Hell's chief assassin. And he's here for you, girlie. 
Silent Bob stares at a crack in the doors. A milky drop of shit drips through it. 
BETHANY 
What are we doing down here, then?. Any second now he'll be blasting through that door! 
SERENDIPITY 
Shit's brainless. If we can sit tight for a couple of minutes, he'll forget what he came for. 
Suddenly another drop falls. Then another. Then a steady stream. Silent Bob taps Rufus and points. Rufus reacts. 
RUFUS 
(indicating trickling shit) 
Looks like it's been taking memory training courses... 
SERENDIPITY 
(off trickle) 
JUMP!!! 
The five leap from their perch on the steps, just as the doors explode, dumping a torrent of crap on the steps. The body of muck morphs into NoMan anew. NoMan lumbers toward them. The group, attempting to gain their bearings on the floor, crawls backwards. NoMan pulls a piece of himself off, rolling it around in It's hands. 
SERENDIPITY 
If anybody still remembers any prayers, I suggest you start whipping them out. 
Silent Bob stares wide-eyed up at the approaching demon. And then, something occurs to him. He stops backing up and stands. The others continue moving back. 
BETHANY 
Bob, get down! Jay! 
JAY 
(to Silent Bob) 
You tubby retard! Get your ass back on the floor! 
Silent Bob stands like a statue in the Golgothan's path. The demon snarls a smile, moving ever closer. Silent Bob reaches into his coat and pulls a small canister out. He points it at the beast. A mist shoots out into the face of the Golgothan. It pauses, looking confused. The shitball in It's hand drops to the floor, and then so does It. 
Bethany, Rufus, Serendipity, and Jay climb to their feet and crowd around Silent Bob. They look to the fallen, unconscious behemoeth, then to Silent Bob. 
BETHANY 
(off Bob's canister) 
What was that? 
Silent Bob holds the can out to them: it's a small, trial size can of Glade Air Freshener. Jay looks at it, then at Silent Bob. 
BETHANY 
(reading can) 
'Knocks strong odors out.' 
RUFUS 
Way to go. tubby. 
BETHANY 
Why would you ever carrs this? 
Jay farts. Silent Bob sprays the freshener at his ass. The others look at jay. 
JAY 
What?! 
RUFUS 
(to Serendipity) 
Who has dominion over this thing? 
SERENDIPITY 
Only Lucifer can order a killing. But something doesn't make sense: this thing never travels alone - with it's intelligence level, Lucifer'd never allow it. It usually has some kind of backup. 
RUFUS 
Can you get some answers? 
SERENDIPITY 
I can give it a shot. 
BETHANY 
What's going on? 
RUFUS 
Serendipity's going to talk to that demon. 
JAY 
Cool! Can we watch? 
SERENDIPITY 
Not a good idea. Demon's can wreak havoc on the weak-minded. 
JAY 
Fuck you - weak-minded! Me and Silent Bob can talk to him in his own language! See...? 
(makes the universal metal sign) 
he'd understand this. 
SERENDIPITY 
(shakes her head; to Rufus) 
Whoever sent this might send mor~. I suggest you take the princess and get as far away as possible. 
(to Bethany) 
I'll do what I can to extract some info from shit-boy here. If there's anything helpful. I'll get it to you somehow. 
BETHANY 
(hugs her) 
Thank you. And... you're a great dancer. 
SERENDIPITY 
I'm a better juggler. 
(to jay and Silent Bob) 
You know you're supposed to be prophets. right? Start acting like prophets. You should have seen that thing coming. 
JAY 
(to Bethany) 
Why the hell are we getting yelled at?! 
SERENDIPITY 
Just watch out for Bethany. Go. 
Bethany leads Jay and Silent Bob up the stairs. 
JAY 
(to Silent Bob)

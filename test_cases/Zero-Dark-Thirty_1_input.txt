DANIEL (to the Kuwaiti 
BUSINESSMAN) The poor fucker had to get out of bed. (to the Salesman) As-salamu alaykum. Thanks my friend. 
INT. LAMBORGHINI DEALERSHIP 
They step inside and the salesman flicks on the lights revealing shiny cars displayed like jewels on rotating 
platforms. While the Kuwaiti businessman peers inside a silver model, Daniel confers with the salesman like he's bought twenty of these cars. 
DANIEL Is this a Balboni? Fuck me. This is nice. What are you thinking? 
KUWAITI BUSINESSMAN I think I'll choose this one. The salesman retreats to a back office. 
DANIEL That's a nice choice, my friend. Daniel gives the Kuwaiti a slip of paper. 
KUWAITI MAN Who is it? 
DANIEL Who do you think? The guy's a terrorist. His mother lives here. I just need her phone number. 
KUWAITI MAN There will be no repercussions in Kuwait? 
DANIEL Somebody might die at some point in Pakistan. They shake hands.

Maya chews on a peanut butter & jelly sandwich. Jack calls her on her cell. 
MAYA Hey, Jack. 
JACK You're not gonna like this, he's on the phone, but there's no team to deploy right now. 
MAYA Fuck. She dashes out runs down the hall to an Exit sign - bursts through the door to a staircase -

INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY CIA SECTION - SECURITY BAY - DAY 
The station's surveillance team leader, LARRY, unstraps his flack vest. He looks like the kind of guy you don't mess with....so of course Maya barges into his space like a locomotive. 
MAYA How come you haven't deployed a team to stay in Rawalpindi? 
LARRY For one thing, it's dangerous. For another, the area is too congested for us to be effective without some predictive intelligence. 
MAYA That's why you should forward deploy - so you can shorten your response time. 
LARRY Still, it wouldn't work. 
MAYA Why? 
LARRY The guy never stays on the phone long enough. 
MAYA You haven't tried. 
LARRY Look, I don't have the personnel. 
MAYA That's bullshit. 
LARRY As it is, my guys don't get any sleep tracking the threats within Pakistan. Larry pushes past her to leave, and she follows him. 
MAYA Right, I understand. But I don't really care if your guys get sleep or not. Maya looks at Larry's team sleeping on the couch.

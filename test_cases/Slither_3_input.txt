EXT. STRUTEMYER FARMHOUSE - EVENING 
Kylie's Dad steps onto the front porch of this quaint family farmhouse. He sees Jack heading toward the ranch, and waves. Jack gives a little salute, while muttering to the Older Cop. 
JACK This turns out to be a mountain lion we're gonna look like a damn bunch of idiots. 
The Redneck and Good Ol' Boy make their way to the ranch as well. They see Bill with Starla. 
REDNECK Didn't know it was date night. 
The Good Ol' Boy LAUGHS. 
REDNECK I'll be expecting you toss my salad at the end of all this then, Charlie. 
GOOD OL' BOY Shut up. 
EXT. STRUTEMYER RANCH - MOMENTS LATER 
The posse fans out over this grassy land where the cattle graze, finding places to hide. The sun sets behind them. 
FADE TO: 
EXT. STRUTEMYER RANCH - NIGHT 
Darkness has crept over the ranch, and the beautiful, pastoral scene has become distinctly more sinister. 
The wind blows hard, WHISTLING through the long weeds. 
A rusty rooster windmill atop the old barn twists and CLINKS on its half-bent perch. 
A piece of tarp hangs down from the barn roof, FLAPPING incessantly against the wooden wall. 
Trevor and Jack; the Redneck and the Good Ol' Boy; and Margaret and the Older Cop are hidden around the ranch, waiting, watching or dozing. 
INT. STRUTEMYER BARN - NIGHT 
Inside the barn, the wind is only slightly quieter, and it's darker. Bill, Starla, and Wally are here. Bill peers out through the doorway at cattle drinking from the trough. He looks at Starla; her head tilts to the side as she nods off. When her head falls all the way, she snaps back up, and catches Bill gazing at her. 
Bill nods and smiles. She doesn't smile back; she's embarrassed and miserable and this is the last place she wants to be. 
They sit there for a moment in the dark. 
BILL Hey, Starla, remember that time when you were a kid and you came knocking on my window in the middle of the night? 
Wally looks at them. 
BILL Starla here's twelve. Guess I was fourteen. I said, 'Starla, what the hell you doing out there?' She tells me she's running away to Hollywood to become a big star. She said she knew I was in ROTC, and she was gonna need a bodyguard. Invited me along. 
Wally LAUGHS. Bill smiles. Starla is embarrassed, but grudgingly enjoys the story. 
BILL I said, 'Starla, if there's anybody can take care of herself, I think it's you. I'm gonna have to decline.' 
WALLY (to Starla) How far'd you get? 
STARLA About the bus stop. Ranger Rick here called my dad. 
WALLY Ha! A cop from the get-go!   You son-of-a-bitch! 
STARLA You fucked up our fame and fortune, Bill Pardy. 
BILL Yeah, maybe I did. 
EXT. STRUTEMYER RANCH - NIGHT 
Jack smokes a cigarette as he keeps an eye out for the cow killer. The burning ember of the cigarette is blown off by the wind. Jack searches for it in the dry grass, trying to catch it before it starts a fire. He crawls forward, slapping the ground, when he glances up and sees... 
A large, shadowy shape hulking through the trees on the edge of the forest. 
INT. STRUTEMYER BARN - NIGHT 
Bill, Starla, and Wally see Grant Grant emerging from the forest. He has transformed into something much more monstrous: a giant, gangrenous, slug-like beast, a clump of cells and tumor-like protuberances. He has various tentacle-like-arms growing out of him, like overgrown eyes on a potato. As opposed to just having the disease, he now seems to BE the disease itself. 
STARLA Grant? 
EXT. STRUTEMYER RANCH - NIGHT 
Jack and Trevor watch in amazement as Grant slithers across the field, his large, dark, watery eyes searching out prey. Jack turns to Trevor, pissed, and whispers: 
JACK You said 'squid'! 
TREVOR It got worse. 
The Redneck and the Good Ol' Boy watch too, mouths dropped.

NOVAK I still don't understand why I can't do this... This isn't some "troubled kid" you're dealing with. 
CATHERINE I realize that... 
NOVAK How hard could it be...? 
Catherine and Miriam try to hide their laughter. 
CATHERINE The first... What?  Six or seven times I went in.   Remember what happened? 
MIRIAM Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia. 
CATHERINE Like a New Year's Day hangover. 
MIRIAM He needs to be turned over. 
Novak and Catherine roll Stargher onto his stomach. 
NOVAK This man is deeply disturbed, he... 
CATHERINE You don't know the procedure. 
NOVAK I know him. 
MIRIAM That may be true, but you don't have Catherine's gift.  She... (distracted by Stargher's back) What happened here? 
We see a series of EIGHT BANDAGES. 
RAMSEY We removed eight metal rings. 
Miriam peels away a bandage and examines the flesh. 
CATHERINE Then he should like this. 
Catherine connects Stargher to the SUSPENSION APPARATUS and it HOISTS him off the table. 
CATHERINE (CONT'D) They're comforted by the feeling of weightlessness.  Like floating in water. 
Henry catches Ramsey poking his nose near a THIRD SUIT AND APPARATUS in the dressing area. 
HENRY Don't touch that, please. 
RAMSEY Sorry. 
Miriam prepares a series of CHEMICAL CARTRIDGES and loads them into a container connected to the IV-like tubes linked to the suspension device. 
MIRIAM (intimate, quiet) This isn't your responsibility. Remember that.  Don't let them use guilt as a tool.  If you want to stop, say so. 
CATHERINE I'll be fine. 
MIRIAM She said convincingly. 
Catherine focuses on the procedure and makes the necessary connections.  Reluctantly, Miriam retreats to the monitoring station.  She "locks down" the procedure room and joins Henry, Novak, and Ramsey at the console. 
NOVAK (eyes on the chemical/drug monitors) That's the stuff? 
HENRY About twelve years of research, right Miriam? 
MIRIAM Don't remind me. 
RAMSEY What is it - are they - exactly? 
That's like asking her to explain the rules of cricket.

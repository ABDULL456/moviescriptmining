LENNY COLE No, I am being set up. 
ARCHY You're a dirty bastard Sidney, a very dirty bastard. 
Archy grabs the belt that's used to tie up drowning victims, he throws it round Lenny's chair and stuffs a bit of cloth into Lenny's wide open mouth. 
ARCHY (CONT'D) (to One Two, Handsome Bob and Mumbles) You three, cut yourself free and get out of here,... 
Archy throws a knife across to Mumbles who just catches it and starts to cut his way out of the ropes. Archy gets back on with the job at hand. He reads through the names Lenny has grassed on over the years. 
ARCHY (CONT'D) Michael Finny, ten years. Frazier Nash, fifteen years. Cousin Ronnie, six years,..you dirty bastard. (beat) Michael Dexter, eight years. 
Archy grabs the winch that lowers victims to their crayfish death and bangs it on to the back of the wheel chair. He presses the start button and the wheelchair is raised with haste. 
ARCHY (CONT'D) The Jew twins, fourteen years and of course ME, Archy, four years. 
One Two, Mumbles, and Handsome Bob are free. 
ONE TWO See ya Arch,.... 
The three of them are out like rats up ropes, they start to run down the stairs.

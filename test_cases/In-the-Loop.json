NUMBER TEN CORRIDOR/MALCOLM'S OFFICE - MORNING         2 \nA CIVIL SERVANT hands Malcolm a CD. \nCIVIL SERVANT Monitoring. All the usual. \nMALCOLM How did your team do at the weekend? \nCIVIL SERVANT Yeah, alright. We won. \nMALCOLM Great. (to himself) Wanker. \nMalcolm reaches his office. His assistant SAM is there. \nMALCOLM (CONT'D) Sam. Morning. \nHe hands her the CD and she puts it into a CD player. \nMALCOLM (CONT'D) Well, pop pickers....what Shall we start with today? Wonky Ron....or Simon Foster, on the PM programme for the BBC. Malcolm starts listening to the recording of Simon on the radio. \nEDDIE MAIR (ON RADIO) Well, I'm joined by Simon Foster, the Minister for International development. Thank you for joining us. \nMALCOLM Here we go. \nEDDIE MAIR You've been in the job now for eighteen months, do you think you're making headway? \nSIMON (v/o on radio) Ah. Yes I do. You'd expect me to say that I suppose. \nPage 1 \n3   INT. DIFED OPEN PLAN OFFICE. DAY                             3 \nJudy Malloy, the Department's Press Officer, is preparing for her minister's arrival. \nJUDY Mark, are you co-ordinating that millenium goals press release? \nMARK Yes. \nJUDY Well co-ordinate it better. \nMARK Yes, can do. \nJUDY Is that the Minister? Bloody nail - has anyone got a nail file? \n4   INT. DFID OPEN PLAN OFFICE. DAY.                             4 \nSIMON is arriving with JUDY. Simon carrying his red dispatch box. Simon's worried. \nSIMON Have we heard anything from Malcolm about last night's interview? \nJUDY No not yet. SIMON Perhaps he didn't hear it. \nJUDY Or maybe he's dead. \nSIMON (with a degree of genuine hope) He might be dead. He might have had that massive stroke we've all been waiting for. It's in the post. \n5   INT. MALCOLM'S OFFICE. DAY.                                  5 \nSIMON (ON RADIO) ...preventable sickness in many of the poorest countries round the world....and Of course the big one is diarrhoea, which is a major, major issue.... Page 2 \n5   CON TINUE D:                                                      5 \nMALCOLM Diarrhoea? I mean, this is the minister for International Development. He should be talking about food parcels, not fucking arse-spraying mayhem. \nSAM laughs. \nSIMON (ON RADIO) And so if we can tackle the easy things, like diarrhoea, then we can..... \nMALCOLM Oh yes, say it again. Very good. What is this, The Shitting Forecast? \nSIMON (ON RADIO) ...and then hopefully that will strike another blow in the war against preventable diseases. EDDIE MAIR You mentioned the word `war\" \nMALCOLM is paying extremely close attention now. \nMALCOLM Steady Eddie... \nSIMON (ON RADIO) Against preventable diseases, yes.... \nEDDIE MAIR (ON RADIO) Yes. All the evidence now points to a US military intervention in the Middle East. Is that you view? \nTOBY Yeah, alright. \nSUZY Oh and be careful - cars! \nThey walk off in separate directions. \n9   MORNING/INT. MICHAEL'S FO OFFICE - MORNING                        9 \nToby is walking towards DFID. As he nears the building he finds himself next to Malcolm, who is heading in too. Toby is on the phone. \nINTERCUT PHONE CALL: \nTOBY Are you going to keep ringing me up every two minutes, because you're starting to remind me of my mum. And that could lead to all sorts of erectile dysfunction. \nSuzy is still in the FO office. \nPage 6 \n9   CON TINUE D:                                                     9 \nSUZY I'm just checking whether you put last night's lasagne in the fridge. \nIn the FO office, MICHAEL arrives. He has a small suitcase and a paper bag. He holds this up. \nMICHAEL (mouthing) Croissants! \nBack with Malcolm, Toby close by. Malc's on the phone. \nMALCOLM No. You're fine to go ahead and print that. It's lies, you'd be lying, but go ahead. He did not say unforeseeable. No he did not. Oh, just before you go -- when I tell your wife about you and Angela Heaney at the Blackpool conference...would email be better? Or a phone call? Or, hey I know, I'll write it on a cake, \"Your hack husband betrayed you on the 4th of October, and congratulations on the new baby\" in those little silver balls. (BEAT) Yeah, maybe best to spike it? Okay. Fuckity-bye! \nToby is now next to Malcolm in the building (or better still, in a lift). Malcolm becomes aware of him. \nTOBY No, it's fine, it's in the fridge. I put some clingfilm over it. In the FO office, Michael switches on some classical music. \nSUZY Why did you put clingfilm on it? \nTOBY To keep it fresh. \nMalcolm starts dialling on his phone. \nSUZY It's in the fridge, that'll keep it fresh. \nTOBY No, but it still might dry out. \nMALCOLM (into phone) Yeah, Malcolm Tucker. Can I speak to James Lewis at the PM Programme please? Page 7 \n9    CON TINUE D: (2)                                            9 \nMichael hands Suzie a croissant. \nMICHAEL (knowing Toby is on the other end of the line) Still slightly warm. That's how I like my women as well. \nSUZY Clingfilm is carcinogenic, Toby. \nTOBY No it isn't. That's a myth. Clingfilm is perfectly safe. \nMalcolm now eyeing Toby with suspicion/contempt -- who is this dick? Toby tries to smile, lowers his voice, embarrassed. \nMALCOLM (into phone) No, I'll hold,. what's he waiting for?     A sex-change? \nTOBY They wouldn't sell clingfilm if it gave you cancer. Clingfilm doesn't give you cancer. And Lasagne doesn't give you syphillis. \nMALCOLM James! Right --Simon Foster? Yeah, very funny, the Diarrhoea of a Nobody. Listen, we get an easy ride on Tom tomorrow, OK? (getting annoyed) No, YOU relax. Tell you what, I'll come over a lock you in a flotation tank and pump it full of sewage until you drown. GET ME FUCKING BRIAN! \nTITLE - IN THE LOOP \n10   INT. SIMON'S OFFICE - DAY.                                  10 \nSimon and Judy are still prepping the funny question. .. \nSIMON Paris Hilton? \nJUDY Are you serious? \nSIMON Lily Allen. \nJUDY No. No women. Page 8 \n10   CON TINUE D:                                                     10 \nSIMON The Olson twins? \nJudy gets a call. \nJUDY Hi. Right. I see. \nShe rings off. \nSIMON (sensing something's up) What? \nJUDY Malcolm's coming to see you. \nJUDY Because it's a scheduled media appearance by this department's Secretary Of State and it therefore falls within my purview... \nMALCOLM Your purview? Where do you think you are sweetheart, in some Regency costume drama? This is a government department, not a fucking Jane Austen novel. Allow me to pop a jaunty little bonnet on your purview and ram it up the shitter with a lubricated horse cock. \nJUDY Malcolm, your swearing doesn't impress me. My husband works for Tower Hamlets and believe me, those kids make you sound like Angela Lansbury. \nMALCOLM (to Simon, lads' chat) She's married? The poor bastard. \nSIMON But...okay, Judy's lubricated horse cock aside for one moment.... (Judy walks out) Are you saying that I'm now not allowed to make any media appearances? \nMALCOLM No, not until we can trust you to keep to the line. \nSIMON But I was going to keep to the line: \"I don't actually think war is unforeseeable.\" \nPage 12 \n12   CON TINUE D: (3)                                          12 \nMalcolm's looking out of the office, monitoring Judy's movements. She's flashed up on his radar. He's tracking her. \nMALCOLM What is it then? \nA beat. \nSIMON Is it...I don't know? Foreseeable? No. \nMALCOLM No. Not foreseeable. That's fucking declaring war. Do you want to fucking declare war? \nSIMON I'm a cabinet minister. I didn't get here by screwing up every media appearance I ever had. \nMALCOLM Write this down. It's neither forseeable nor undorseeable. \nSIMON Right. So not inevitable, but not...evitable. \nMalcolm leaves the office. Toby is still hovering. \nMALCOLM (calling back to Simon) Okay, you need to work on this fucking line. (to Judy) That includes you, Jane Fucking Austen with the strap-on. Oh, and put the sniff out there that the next time the BBC ambushes a Minister with a war question we'll drop a bomb on them. \nJUDY I can't do that. That's political, that's not in my... \nMALCOLM Purview, Marie Antoinette? Weel listen, darling, why don't you fucking scuttle off back to fucking Cranford and play around with your tea and cake and horse cocks. Let them eat cock! (TO TOBY) You, Ron Weasley -- you do it. \nMalcolm heads out. \nPage 13 \n13   INT. FO MICHAELS OFFICE - DAY                              13 \nSuzy and Michael in Michael's office. Suzy's getting documents together for the big meeting. Michael's at his computer, on the phone. Classical music still on. \nMICHAEL (on phone) You needn't worry about the Canadians. They're just happy to be there. (Pause) Yes, well, they always look surprised when they're invited. \nSUZY Listen, shall I just give Toby a quick call about the Simon Foster thing? \nSuzy dials. \n14   INT. DFID/INT FOREIGN OFFICE MICHAELS OFFICE               14 \nToby checks the phone. Sees it's Suzy -- Christ, not her again, I'm a bit busy here. He answers. \nINTERCUT PHONE CALL: \nTOBY Hiya. You do know this is the third time you've rung? Are you on a new tariff? \nSUZY So? How's it going? You found the bogs yet? TOBY All a bit manic. It was never like this at Agriculture. People tend not to swear so much about wheat. Apart from farmers. They swear about everything. \nSUZY (to Michael, re. the music) Can you turn that down a bit? (to Toby) Look, I've got a leg up for you. I think we could get Simon into the big meeting with Karen Clark? \nTOBY Right - Karen Clark from...is that the woman who went round Britain in a coracle for leukemia? \nPage 14 \n14   CON TINUE D:                                                   14 \nSUZY Karen Clark, US Assistant Secretary of State? \nTOBY Oh right. Shit. Karen Clark. Wow. Thanks. \nSUZY Hang on, Michael wants to say something. \nMICHAEL Meat. \nSUZY Meat. \nMICHAEL Meat! Simon's only going to be meat in the room. Don't get his hopes up. SUZY Yeah, so you know -- Simon, between us, he's just going to be meat in the room. \nTOBY Meat? \nJudy, nearby, hears this. \nSUZY (waving him away) Yeah. The Americans don't feel they're getting a real meeting unless there's thirty of you on each side. So Simon is...you know those polystyrene peanut things they use to pack electrical goods? Sort of one of those. But you might not want to tell him that. I ought to go. I love you. \nCHAD We'd like a dual horse-shoe formation for the meeting set-up - an enclave for Ms Clark, an enclave for the Pentagon delegation. First names acceptable to all parties and politely we request the presence of both carbonated and non- carbonated waters. \nSUZY Right. CHAD Thanks so much. \nHe walks purposefully off. \nMICHAEL My God. Who was that, Young Lankenstein? \nJUDY Oh he'll be running something relatively major. They're all kids in Washington. It's like Bugsy Malone, but with real guns. \n18   INT. FOREIGN OFFICE GRAND MEETING ROOM      - DAY              18 \nChad's dual horse-shoe is packed with people. The room's pretty much full. \nKAREN CLARK from the State Department is surrounded by ten or so aides and functionaries, security people and assistants. (Including Chad and LIZA one of Karen's senior aides.) Then there is Bob Adriano's gang of advisors, smaller but sitting separately. \nNext to them is a Pentagon delegation, including uniformed members of all three services. \nLots of hubbub. \nSUZY leads SIMON, TOBY and JUDY in, and shows them to their seats. \nPage 18 \n18   CON TINUE D:                                                   18 \nThey're as far away from the US delegation as it's possible to be, and Simon's seat is actually behind a pillar. Suzy goes off to join Michael and the Foreign Office delegation near the front. Suzy looks over to Toby, uses her hands to make mock binoculars, as if to say, 'you're very far away, look how close and therefore important I am'. \nSIMON No-one will hear me if I say anything. How's your view? Can we swap? \nSimon and Toby swap seats, but Simon can still barely see anything. \nSIMON (CONT'D) (to Judy) Can I swap with you? \nJUDY I think the meeting's starting. \nIt is. \nSIMON Well, quickly then, swap. \nSimon and Judy swap seats. \nThe meeting is now underway. We're with Karen Clark. \nKAREN We all agree this is a very tough time, but I don't want a consensus to form around the premise that conflict is necessarily the primary option at this point. \nBack with Simon, Judy and Toby. Simon still straining to see. \nSIMON Are people thinking that? That's -- a bit hardcore. \nHe cranes again to see. \nSIMON (CONT'D) No, this is worse. Swap back. \nSimon and Judy swap seats again. \nBack with Karen. She's holding up a paper in a red folder. \nPage 19 \n18   CON TINUE D: (2)                                          18 \nKAREN This paper, authored by one of my aides, Liza Weld. You don't mind me fore- grounding this do you Liza? \nLiza reacts. Her paper? In a big meeting. Is this good or bad? \nKAREN (CONT'D) Illuminates the logistical factors we face. She highlights a number of reasons why, in practical terms, we can't envision a theatre deployment for twelve months. \nBOB ADRIANO Although not everyone might agree with the assumptions made in that paper. \nKAREN Really - such as what? \nBOB ADRIANO The committee feels a much quicker deployment is possible. \nKAREN Which committee? \nBOB ADRIANO (covering) This has been discussed in a number of committees. If I said one committee... \nKAREN You did. \nADRIANO Then that was a slip of the tongue \nKAREN Have you accidentally alluded to some secret committee? A war committee? \nMICHAEL If I can interject here, I'm aware we're pushed for time. I'd like to move us on agenda-wise. Our next item is international relief co-ordination. \nKaren is conferring with Liza, Adriano with his guy. \nKAREN Have you heard of this committee? \nADRIANO What's this Liza Weld paper? Page 20 \nCHAD Ooh. \nLIZA See, you're an only child, aren't you? \nCHAD You bring this up whenever you run out of arguments. I don't see how my parents' limited reproductive abilities reflects badly on me. I'm the sperm that made it. \nLiza walks off, over to Karen. \nCHAD (CONT'D) Have fun with your career kryptonite. \n21   INT. FOREIGN OFFICE LOBBY - DAY                                   21 \nSIMON (re : Karen talking conspiratorially to Liza downstairs) What's that all about? It looks important. \n22   INT. FOREIGN OFFICE LOBBY - DAY                                   22 \nKaren is back, huddled up with Liza. KAREN My teeth hurt. I think the veneers are chipped. Do they look chipped? \nLiza stares into Karen's mouth. \nLIZA Well, I think that one, that one's always been there, right? I'm not sure. Have you got any painkillers? \nKAREN Oh, don't look at my teeth. \n23   INT. FOREIGN OFFICE UPSTAIRS MEZZANINE - DAY                      23 \nJUDY (trying to earwig) Sshhh! \nPage 24 \n24   INT. FOREIGN OFFICE LOBBY - DAY                             24 \nKAREN (looking up at the Brits, off Simon's smile) I don't want to risk a dentist here. \n25   INT. FOREIGN OFFICE UPSTAIRS MEZZANINE - DAY                25 \nThe US delegation are heading off \nTOBY (shouting) Hey Liza! \nLIZA Oh ... Hi ... hi? She knows him but can't immediately place him. \nTOBY Toby? It's Toby. \nLIZA Hi. Hi. \nShe makes the phone sign. He gives a thumbs up, she thinks he's misread the phone sign and gestures, or email by doing typing in the air. Toby signs back, yeah, call on the phone or email - does the typing back. \nJUDY (re the typing gesture) What are you doing? You look like    you're practicing baby massage. \nTOBY She did the Kennedy scholarship at my college. I had a small thing for her. \nJUDY I can imagine. \nTOBY I'm not sure she remembered me. \nJUDY No, that is one of the side effects of Rohypnol. \nPage 25 \n26   INT. FOREIGN OFFICE. DAY.                                 26 \nKAREN Linton has set up a secret war committee, I just know it. I mean, Linton is an absolute lunatic, Liza. He is dangerous. The voices in his head are now singing barbershop together. \n27   EXT. FOREIGN OFFICE - DAY                                 27 \nThe conversation is continuing between Simon Judy and Toby as they exit the FO. \nSIMON Yeah. Jesus. I really really hope there's not a war. It's going to be a nightmare. It's bad enough having to cope with the fucking Olympics. \nThey appear outside. There's a press pack of 10 or so reporters and photographers there. \nPRESS Minister!/Simon!/Mr Foster! \nSimon is taken aback. \nSIMON Fuck. Who let the dogs out? We don't need this. \nJUDY Er, you wanted a chance to row back on the war. Do you want to nail the line? \nSIMON What? No. No. I'll freestyle it. \nThe press are calling. \nREPORTER 1 Is war unforeseeable Minister? \nSIMON Look, (grappling now) ...loads of things that are actually very likely are also unforeseeable. Y'know, For the plane in the fog the mountain is unforeseeable, but then it, is suddenly very real and inevitable. \nToby and Judy look at one another. This isn't good. \nPage 26 \nLiza, Karen and Chad arrive in the buzzing State Department offices, knackered but in action mode. \nKAREN Okay - so, priorities are: take a shower, get me on Linton's War Committee, get me a dental appointment. Not necessarily in that order. \nKaren walks past various desks covered in tons of Post- Its. Stops a STAFFER as he passes. KAREN (cont'd) (CONT'D) What's Linton been up to while we've been away....have we declared war on California yet? \nBut before the staffer can answer they run right into Linton. Karen stands her ground. \nLINTON Ah. Karen. \nKAREN Linton. \nLINTON How was London? Good hotel? \nKAREN Great hotel, thank you. \nPage 30 \n31   CON TINUE D:                                                      31 \nLINTON Good meetings? \nKAREN Yes. We had some good discussions. The time at Number Ten could possibly have been better spent but then... \nKaren realises that Linton is reading a message on his cell phone and not listening. \nLINTON Good. Welcome back. I'll read your words when they come through. Thank you so much \nLinton heads off to his office. A beat later so does Karen. Chad goes off a little towards Linton's office. \nKAREN Is Chad coming... ? LIZA (watching) He's doing his desperate chorus girl thing, hanging around trying to catch Linton's eye. That's why he's wearing his push-up bra today. \nCHAD (as he passes) Assistant Secretary of State -- hi. \nLINTON Brad. CHAD Chad \nLINTON Uh-huh. Exactly \nCHAD Can I...? \nLinton ignores him as he goes to join Bob Adriano waiting for him in his office. \nKAREN So listen, Liza, I need you to find out the names of the ten dullest committees currently operating on the hill. \nLIZA Dullest? \nPage 31 \n31   CON TINUE D: (2)                                          31 \nKAREN Because Linton is not going to call it the big horrible scarey war committee...they'll have buried the war committee under the most boring name they can think of. 'Diverse Strategy Committee'- not that, I'm on that. But it'll be a committee that sounds so tedious you want to self-harm. \nThey glance over into Linton's area. He is glancing into theirs. \nKAREN(CONT'D) Can you get me General Miller at the Pentagon? (as she leaves) My teeth hurt like hell. \nLIZA (to herself) Sick of hearing about the teeth... \nLiza goes to her desk, picks up her landline. \nLIZA (cont'd) (CONT'D) Hi. I'm calling from Karen Clark's office about a paper written by a staffer here. We need to know if 'Post War Planning: Parameters, Implication's and Possibilities' has reached Assistant Secretary of State Linton Barwick yet? (listens) Yeah...by Liza Weld. (listens, shit!) 'Pwip Pip'? It's already been given an acronym? (listens) No I don't want to fast-track it. Would it possible to slow-track it? Well can we create one? \n32   INT. STATE DEPARTMENT. LINTON'S OFFICE - DAY                32 \nLooking over at Karen. Now alone, who is still stealing glances over. \nLINTON I do not understand why anyone would choose to work in a glass office. In my opinion glass offices are for perverts. \nBOB ADRIANO I could request the glass be frosted? \nPage 32 \n32   CON TINUE D:                                                     32 \nLINTON (as if Bob Adriano brought it up) Frosting is for cakes, Bob. Now. What happened in London? \nBOB ADRIANO Generally positive. Two glitches. Karen flagged a report by one of her staffers - Liza. She's obviously trying to use it as some kind of roadblock. It's called Pwip Pip. \nLINTON Pip what? \nBOB ADRIANO Pwip Pip. \nLINTON What is that a report on - birdcalls? What does that stand for? \nBOB ADRIANO I don't recall. It's factish. Intel - case for and against intervention. \nLINTON We've got all the facts we need on this. In the land of truth, my friend, the man with one fact is king. You said there was another thing? \nBOB ADRIANO In the meeting with the Foreign Office the Committee was accidentally briefly alluded to. \nLINTON (putting his hand over his mouth so he can't be lip- read) Which committee? \nLINTON Thank you, James \nCHAD Chad. \nKAREN Ok. Why don't you just recap for me all the committees that you're currently sitting on? \nPage 36 \n34   CON TINUE D: (2)                                          34 \nLINTON I'm Sorry, Karen, you appear to be bleeding from your mouth. \nShe is. But she doesn't want to leave the meeting. \nKAREN Oh don't try to change the subject Linton. \nLIZA (Looking at Karen) Oh no. Holy Mother of.... \nEveryone is just looking at her. \nLINTON I don't mean to be rude Karen but that is a tad... repulsive. I can't concentrate on what you're saying. You have blood coming out of your teeth and that's not right. \nKaren gets up to go. It's awkward, she's boxed in and has to clamber over the others to get to the door. \nKAREN Okay, Liza come with me. \nCHAD (aside, to Liza) Go, Buffy - you belong to the vampire queen now. \nLiza follows Karen out. Chad takes Liza's seat. LINTON I don't like to see a woman bleeding from the mouth. It makes me think of Country and Western music. Which I really can't abide. \nCHAD (what?) Yes! Ha ha! Exactly. \nLinton sees his chance to take advantage of Karen being out of the room. \nLINTON Actually while we're on Any Other Business I do have a few points I'd like to resolve. \nPage 37 \n35   INT. STATE DEPARTMENT - CORRIDOR/BATHROOM - DAY              35 \nThey head into the bathroom. \nLiza is pulling handfuls of tissue. Handing them to Karen who is dabbing her teeth. \nKAREN Where are at you at with the committees? \nLIZA I got it down to two. The Aims and Policy Alignment Committee. Here - put some down your front - you don't want it to go down your... And the Future Planning Committee. \nKAREN Well, it's not the first one. I set that one up. Does that really sound dull to you? I thought that was a good name. \nLIZA Right, no, it is a good name. \nKAREN Okay, find out if it is definitely the Future Planning Committee. \nLIZA Okay. Okay. Right, listen, I might go and do that. You're not going to shout at me if I go and do that are you? KAREN I'm not a fucking monster Liza, okay? Will you stop implying I'm some kind of monster? \n36   INT. STATE DEPARTMENT - DAY                                  36 \nLiza heads out of the toilets to see Bob Adriano ahead, quite a long way. \nLIZA Bob! \nBob Adriano stops and turns. \nBOB ADRIANO Liza. \nLiza sprints and catches up with him. \nPage 38 \n36   CON TINUE D:                                                     36 \nLIZA So listen, Bob, there's something I really want to tell you. We're having a hunk of the month competition, and I just didn't want you to be feel...objectified in any way....and \nBOB ADRIANO (hopes it might be a come- on?) Oh really? \nLIZA Karen knows about the Future Planning Committee. \nBob Adriano looks shocked, tries to cover it up. \nBOB ADRIANO I have no idea what you're talking about. Liza smiles. Runs back into the toilets and gives a thumbs up to Karen. \n37   INT. WASHINGTON AIRPORT - DAY                                    37 \nSimon and Toby walking past the queues at US immigration, they are being ushered through a separate channel by airport workers and diplomatic staff. As they're escorted Simon and Toby catch each other's eye. \nTOBY This is cool. SIMON Don't be callow Toby. We're on official business. \nA Homeland Security official ushers them through. \nSIMON (CONT'D) (cont'd) This is a little bit fucking cool. \nToby comes out of the bathroom. \nTOBY Simon, I've managed to get us on the... \nMalcolm is suddenly in his face. MALCOLM Hello!! \nTOBY (heart attack) Fuck! Malcolm! Jesus. \nMALCOLM You're meant to shit yourself in there. Not out here. \nTOBY Right. (to Simon) I've got us on to Linton's Future Planning Committee in the morning. \nSIMON Okay. What's that? \nPage 48 \n54   CON TINUE D:                                                   54 \nTOBY It's the war committee. \nMALCOLM What? The actual....war committee? \nTOBY Yeah, Liza says that... \nMALCOLM Who's going to be there? \nTOBY Karen Clark, Liza, me and Simon. (off Simon's look) Simon and me. \nMALCOLM Who else is going -- Jimmy Osmond? Gwyneth Paltrow? You've been invited to a diversion. The real committee, the real thing, that's happening at The White House. \nToby picks his jacket up. \nTOBY Yeah well, I'll text you the details because I'm going to go out.for A quick drink with some State Department bods. \nMALCOLM Don't mention this to the press, ok? Don't mention it to anyone. Because if the press get a whiff there's a war committee, even a cardboard one, every fucker in this town is going to turn up and try and get on it. So no matter what gay bar you end up, keep it schtumm. \nMalcolm flicks the TV over to a news channel. \nSIMON I was watching that. \nMalcolm looks at him. \nMALCOLM I have to have a word with you. You might want to slip into your negligee. \nToby heads out. \nPage 49 \n55   INT. BLACK CAT INDIE CLUB - NIGHT                           55 \nToby and Liza sit in a booth. They are by far the most formally dressed people in the club. A band are playing angry rock with a vaguely political message. A small knot of people are rocking out. \nLIZA (re : the mosh pit) You see those guys? The mosh pit? \nTOBY Yes, I don't think I've ever seen a more civilised 'mosh pit' it's more of a mosh caucus actually. \nLIZA House staffers, Senators' interns, most of them are half-man half-PDF file. Tonight they rage hard. Tomorrow they go back to the hill and argue noise reduction legislation. \nThey're chuckling, having a good time. \nTOBY (beat, looks at her.) You're worried. \nLIZA (she's been mulling on something else entirely) It's Pwip Pip. TOBY I'm sorry? Pip Pip? Is this... a person or a cell phone tarrif or.. \nLIZA It's my paper. On the war. Pros and Cons of the war. But I came up with too many cons. The pro-war guys have started calling me `Connie'. So, yes I'm fucking worried. My career's on the line. \nTOBY Yeah- I noticed you're worried, cos I saw you looking worried. I'm perceptive like that. But... (can't think of anything else) Don't worry. \nLIZA Okay, this place blows. I'm going. What are you doing? Page 50 \n55   CON TINUE D:                                                     55 \nTOBY Well I'm incredibly tired. It feels like my brain's eight hours behind but my liver's 12 hours ahead. \nLIZA You don't want to come back to my place for a quick catch up? \nIt's an alluring offer. \nTOBY However, due to technological developments I no longer need sleep, but am physically rejuvenated by alcohol! \nHe guzzles from his beer bottle as they leave. \n56   INT. LIZA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                    56 Toby and Liza are on the bed together, kissing. \nTOBY Could I just say, you know, that what happens in Washington stays in Washington? \nLIZA Yeah I live in Washington. So that doesn't really work for me. \n57   INT. WASHINGTON HOTEL - EVENING                                  57 Malcolm is     still in Simon's room. He's texting. Simon sneaks the     remote and flips from the news back to the shark doc.     Malcolm, without looking up, picks up the remote and     flicks back to the news. \nMALCOLM We are under enormous pressure Simon. Karen will want you to say, `war is unforeseeable'. Linton will want you to talk up `climbing the mountain of conflict'. You say nothing, okay? You can't swing both ways, you're not David fucking Bowie. \nSIMON Toby -- I don't want to read you the riot act here but I am going to have to read some extracts from the riot act. Like Section 1 paragraph 1 clause 1. Don't leave your boss twisting in the wind and then burst in late smelling like a pissed seaside donkey. (special needs) `The British are coming'? \nTOBY (feels he's taken enough now) So I turned up late to the meeting Simon. I'm sorry. But it's not like I threw up in there. \nPage 54 \n62   CON TINUE D:                                                     62 \nSIMON No you're right. I should be thanking you for not throwing up. Well done. You're a star. You didn't wet yourself, you're in the right city, you didn't say anything overtly racist, you didn't pull your dick out and start plucking it and shouting 'willy banjo'. No I'm being unfair, you got so much right. Without actually being there for the beginning of one of the biggest meetings of my career. You're a legend. \nAn uncomfortable beat. \nTOBY That was just - the first bit was it? We're going back in do you ...think? \nSIMON We'd barely said hello. I've had muggings that have lasted longer than that. We really only spoke about flammable cheese. \nLiza comes out, passes by. Toby mouths `shit' to himself. \nLIZA (looking at a list on her desk, then to a staffer) Are these all requests to get on the committee? What's going on? Did someone post an invite on Facebook? I'm drowning in Senators. It's Senator soup here. \nTOBY Hi Liza. \nThey're uncomfy with each other. \nLIZA Hey Toby. \nToby gets up for a private word. \nTOBY (re last night) You feeling okay? \nLIZA Yes, I'm feeling fine. Why were you late? \nTOBY Because...you know...you didn't wake me up. \nPage 55 \n62   CON TINUE D: (2)                                          62 \nLIZA You looked so sweet. I thought you knew what you were doing. \nTOBY I was asleep, of course I didn't. That's how people walk out of windows. \nSTAFFER ((hand over phone, calls over) Hey Liza, I've got another call about the Committee from Senator Crudden's office, he wants in too. \nLIZA What is going on here? Fuck. Why's this my problem? Toby you sure you didn't do bad? You didn't mention the committee to anyone else? TOBY Nada. Nada.. Bad-da. Nada-bada bing-bong ding-dang-dong. (beat, she looks at him) I have no idea what I'm saying anymore I think I really am still quite drunk. \nChad is passing. As Liza turns away Toby's face does a spasm of regret at his brazen lying. \nCHAD Everyone is so hot for your paper. I'm running off another ten copies. It's spreading like a virus, Liza. You're in hot water. You're lobsterising. \nLIZA I don't feel that. \nCHAD It's by degrees. Wafting. Bisque. I smell lobster. Can you smell lobster, Toby? \nSimon calls Toby back over. \nSIMON (O.S.) Mate! \nTOBY I need to... \nLIZA Sure. \nToby goes back to Simon Page 56 \n62   CON TINUE D: (3)                                          62 \nLIZA (CONT'D) So, how far would you go with Linton, you freaky little stalker? Downtown? Or all the way up Brokeback Mountain? \n63   INT. WHITE HOUSE. SMALLISH ROOM - DAY                       63 \nMalcolm is arriving into a meeting room set up with water etc with a young man who looks like an intern, A.J. \nA.J. How are you today? Beat the traffic? \nMalcolm looking around, as if things aren't right. \nMALCOLM Yeah yeah. Hunky dory. Can I get a coffee? He gives AJ his coat. \nA.J. (doesn't take coat then eventually does and just puts it on a chair, not the coat stand) Sure, sure, if we get started, I'll get my assistant to bring us some refreshments. \nMALCOLM (realising) Your assistant? A.J. (sitting, picking up a file in the room) Yeah. So, Item. We need to have a conversation about the mood of the British Parliament. Any bumps in the road ahead. \nMALCOLM I'm sorry son, am I - is this it? No offence, but shouldn't you be at school with your head down a toilet? \nA.J. Your first point there, the offence. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to take it. Your second point. I'm 22. But - item - It's my birthday in nine days, so if it would be more comfortable we could... wait...? \nPage 57 \n63   CON TINUE D:                                                      63 \nMALCOLM Don't get sarcastic with me son. (starts dialling) We burnt this tight-arsed city to the ground in 1814 and I'm all for doing it again. Starting with you, you frat fuck. You get sarcastic with me again and I will stuff so much cotton wool dowm your fucking throat it'll come out of your arse like the wee tail on a playboy bunny. Okay? I thought...I was led to believe I was attending the war committee. \nLinton calls the over-stuffed, standing-room-only room to order. \nLINTON Okay, due to the fact that seemingly everyone in the world who owns a suit has turned up for this meeting, we'll be relocating to a bigger room. Room 720. So, if you will be so kind... The committee members file out. \n68   EXT. WASHINGTON STREET NR STATE DEPARTMENT - DAY                68 \nMalcolm is legging it down the street. \n69   INT. LARGER COMMITTEE ROOM 720 - DAY                            69 \nThe committee members file in. \nMiller goes close up to Linton. GENERAL MILLER Just so you know -- Karen and I did not appreciate having to sneak around like Mulder and Scully trying to find out about this committee. \nLINTON Well, you're both here now. John and Yoko. \nGENERAL MILLER You and I need to talk, mano-a-mano, cocks on the block, about how things are operating around here at the moment. \nLinton not fazed by this. \nLINTON Sure. How about 12:30 tomorrow, my office? \nPage 61 \n69   CON TINUE D:                                                   69 \nGENERAL MILLER Good. \nGeneral Miller takes his seat. Linton turns on Adriano. \nLINTON What the hell happened? \nADRIANO I have no idea how they all heard sir. There must have been a leak. \nGeneral Miller is sitting next to Karen. They're watching Linton having angry words with Adriano. \nGENERAL MILLER Look at Adriano. Poor fuck. He looks like he's with his Daddy: \"Sorry, Bob, you're adopted. From a couple with hereditary heart defects.\" KAREN \"And your mother only ever kept your baby clothes for the purposes of voodoo.\" \nSimon is sitting with Toby, marvelling at the numbers of people cramming into the room. \nSIMON I'm room meat again. This is a massive abattoir of room meat. Stay outside Tobes, I need a guy on the outside. Make friends with Chad, that boy from The Shining. He knows stuff. Pump him. TOBY Oh no. I want to stay in here with Miller. Don't make me pump Chad. \nSIMON I'm making you pump Chad. Go on. \nToby gets up to leave. \nSIMON (CONT'D) It'll be easy peasy lemon squeezy. \nTOBY No it won't. It'll be difficult difficult lemon difficult. \nToby reluctantly leaves, trying to grab another peek at Miller. \nPage 62 \n70   EXT.

The room has thirty or so people in it. \nLINTON So, welcome to this, somewhat engorged session of the Future Planning Committee. You can all see an agenda? \nPeople are looking at their agendas, low-level chatter, pouring of water, etc. - a general pre-meeting feel. \nKAREN Assistant Secretary -- here on point 6, it feels like there's an assumption that we'll be invading. Should we talk about the practical? I mean this is the war committee after all? \nLINTON It's the Future Planning Committee. \nKAREN Unofficially it's known as the war committee. \nLINTON Well, unofficially we can call anything whatever we like. (he holds up a water glass) Unofficially, this is a shoe. But it's not a shoe, Karen, it's a glass of water, and this is the Future Planning Committee. \n72   INT.

Although it would seem a general consensus may be forming. \nSIMON Oh no. Should we send Mark a card? \nMALCOLM Nah, I'll send him a ouija board so they can keep in touch. \nPage 67 \n76   CON TINUE D:                                                     76 \nSIMON So what are we getting back to? Apart from a nice cup of tea and some knife crime? \nTOBY Constituency surgery in Northampton. \nSIMON Great, meeting my constituents. It's like being Simon Cowell, but without the ability to say, `Fuck off, you're mental.' \n77   INT. CONSTITUENCY OFFICE. DAY.                                   77 \nTOBY and SIMON are with Simon's constituency agent, ROZ, she's ushering them into the small, damp little constituency office. ROZ's arm is in a sling (Jo Scanlon's arm actually is in a sling) and she has difficulty opening the door \nROZ (to Simon) Sorry, could you...? You just need to kick the bottom quite hard. \nSimon kicks the bottom of the door to unstick it. \nRoz opens the door. There are a few constituents waiting to see Simon, he nods a hello. \nSIMON (Roz has gone ahead, this is to Toby) Look at them. They all have that smell....like a charity shop, you know? (to constituents) Afternoon! \nA couple of the waiting constituents respond. They go through to another little office. \nROZ Right, here you go, you're pretty booked up - there's a list on the desk. I'm just going to have a look at the guttering. \nSIMON I'm just back from America, so it was pretty tough to make it up here - but you know. That's me. \nROZ Of course. Right. How was the President?

STATE DEPARTMENT - DAY                                    79 \nGeneral Miller (and an aide or two?) marches into Linton and Karen's section of State. He's got a meeting scheduled. He's a man on a mission. \nHe marches straight past Bob Adriano ... \nMILLER (by way of explanation) Twelve-thirty. \nBOB ADRIANO Um, hold on General ... \nAnd into Linton's office. \nBut - it's empty. MILLER What the fuck? \nBOB ADRIANO Yeah, Secretary Linton Barwick wanted me to let you know his last - meeting looks like it's over-running. He sends apologies. \nMiller stands there for a beat. Very very annoyed. \nMILLER He stood me up? They're better be a fucking good reason. Like he's dead. That is just plain fucking rude. I mean, how would he like it if I just did a big hairy shit on his desk? \nBOB ADRIANO You're very w-welcome to wait, we have newspapers and periodicals? Page 69 \n79   CON TINUE D:                                                   79 \nHe gestures to a seating area. Miller picks up a magazine. Rolls it up, looks at Bob Adriano. Might Miller, possibly, hit him? \nMILLER Yeah well excuse me if at this time of national crisis I don't sit with a thumb up my ass flipping through Time magazine eating pop tarts? (he heads off fast - not quite sure where he's going, calls back as he goes) Tell him to call me. But he might not get through cos I'm a fucking busy man. \nHe finds himself heading into Karen's office. \nIt's empty. He stands there for a beat. Shuts the door. \nLooks around. Picks up a hole punch. Kicks the couch. Karen enters, surprised to find him there. \nKAREN Hey, what is it? \nMILLER Yeah - can I hang around in here for a while? \nKAREN Er. Sure. Why? \nMILLER Do I need a fucking reason? (beat, calming down) Linton's playing me like a fucking turkey drumstick on a big bass drum. \nKAREN Look, I was going to order food, do you want to eat. \n81   CON TINUE D:                                                     81 \nKAREN Yes I want that. (points to various packages) I want that, that, that, that and that. Those I don't care about. And these let's pack up and drop on North Korea. \nGENERAL MILLER (beat, reads) Someone should leak this. \nOutside Liza sees them discussing her paper animatedly. It doesn't look good to her. \nKAREN Someone maybe shaped a little bit like you. \nGENERAL MILLER Me? Are you kidding? KAREN You have more gravitas. \nGENERAL MILLER Exactly. I'm too senior. I can't leak. Leaking is for people like your Liza and the Boy called It out there. (eats) It's insane. Not only is the case against war incredibly strong, the case for is caveated to hell. (reading) \"Most analysts believe the state is looking to expand aggressively beyond its borders...\" Then here in the caveats, the only source is `Ice Man' - a possible alcoholic - who's probably called that cos he gets through ten bags / icebergs a day in his fucking vodka tonics. INR say we can't trust him. That's us disputing our own findings. Has Linton read this? \nKAREN I'm not sure he reads. You're a General. Have him killed. \nGENERAL MILLER You see this is why we never got together. That and the hobo teeth. \n82   INT. STATE DEPARTMENT/INT.

About a wall. KAREN Gaza? \nSIMON Uh-huh. What can I do for you? \nKAREN Where were you in the committee? I called for back-up, you sat there like a dumb sack of shit. Maybe worse, cos at a molecular level a bag of shit is probably fizzing with energy. \nSIMON Well - okay. Yes. Um. Well, I have to say Karen, I have a clear strategy here. I'm playing the long game. \nKAREN There is no long game. They've bounced us into a short game. You looked like a...what do you call it in England?

He appears not to be nutting me, but he might well nut me. \nTOBY So what did Karen Clark want? \nSIMON Do you think I came over as weak on the committee over there? \nTOBY Well, uh, no, of course not.

Is the really brave thing actually doing what you don't believe? \nJUDY No. \nTOBY Though -- maybe? What's brave about doing the `right thing'? Nothing. Doing the wrong thing is braver. In a way. I mean, you know, wars sometimes work. The War of Independence, that worked. For the Americans. Second World War. That was a good idea. I mean not a good idea but ... \nSIMON I know what you mean. And the Crimean War -- we got nurses out of that. \nTOBY Nurses are good. \nSIMON (as if they've achieved something) Exactly. So...right. Exactly. \nJUDY So you're not resigning? \nPage 92 \n94   CON TINUE D:                                                     94 \nSIMON No, I..(trying to change the subject) where's Malcolm? \n95   INT.

UN BUILDING - DAY Malcolm, Simon, Toby and Judy are being led through a bleak, soulless basement corridor in the UN by Sir Jonathan Tutt, the British ambassador to the UN. \nSIR JONATHAN Hello, gentlemen, Sir Jonathan Tutt. This is it. The United Nations. \nSIMON It's all a bit `blurrrgh', isn't it? \nJUDY It could do with a few more scatter cushions and a bit less asbestos. \nSIR JONATHAN I don't know what you were expecting -- Jacobean panelling perhaps, arabesques of stonework tracery... great fountains... \nMALCOLM It's a shithole.

You just put your lips together and blow. \nMalcolm and Toby look at one another. \nSIR JONATHAN (CONT'D) Right. I'm off upstairs to the informal delegates' reception. Hope there's nibbles, I'm ravenous. \nSir Jonathan leaves. \nSIR JONATHAN No, it can't be. I mean it could be done, it just can't. \nMALCOLM Then I'll do it. (motioning to a door) They're through there? \nSIR JONATHAN Yes but you can't go in, that would be a serious breach of protocol ... \nHe's blocking Malcolm. Malcolm grabs his hand. \nMALCOLM Then you do it. Get in there. \nHe is almost man-handling him in. SIR JONATHAN I'm not dancing with you Malcolm. \nMALCOLM I'm leading, look follow my lead. \nSIR JONATHAN You're not dancing me into the secretariat! \nJonathan breaks off and under his own steam prepares to go in. \nAs Malcolm is leaving Miller blocks his path.

Thanks. (a beat, thinks) Oh, Whoa whoa whoa just a wee moment General Flintstone. Was it you? Did you leak Pwip Pip? I know you can't fire a gun, but can you use a fax? \nMILLER No, see, because I'm upfront about what I do. I don't creep around like some fucking gay mercenary doing other people's dirty work.

I think you're his English bitch and if I walked into your hotel room tonight I'd find you on all fours in fishnets and him hanging out the back of you. \nMALCOLM Oooo. Tough talk from the armchair General. What you going to do? Throw a cushion at me? Put your feet up on a poof and go back to sleep why don't you? \nGENERAL MILLER Listen, Tucker, you may be some scary poodlefucker back in London, but here? You know what you look like? A fucking squeezed dick. You got a blue vein running all the way up to your temple there. That's where I'd put the fucking bullet. But I'd stand well back. You look like you'd be a squirter. \nMALCOLM Have you ever even killed anybody? Really? \nGENERAL MILLER Yep. \nMALCOLM Falling asleep on someone doesn't count. \nGENERAL MILLER (closer) I've done my share. How many you kill, pussy drip? \nMALCOLM Personally, I prefer maiming. \nGENERAL MILLER Go on, tough guy, take a swing at me. I'll smack you so fucking hard you'll be shitting teeth. \nMALCOLM Go ahead. I can see the headlines now. 'Peace-Loving General Starts Fight In UN, Swiss Intervene'.

Simon's going. Everyone's saying he's going. \nSimon passes their open door. \nGENERAL MILLER (spotting Simon) Simon! There he is! Simon. (re internet) This is great shit. I wasn't sure you had the nerve. You're resigning? \nSIMON Ah okay. They're not running with that? I have not said that. \nGENERAL MILLER You're not resigning? \nKAREN You're still playing the hawk? \nSIMON It's much subtler than that. It's nuanced. I'm playing a much cleverer game than that.

MICHAEL She can't very well answer the question if you don't tell her what it is, can she? \nJAMIE Fuck off to your room, Count of Cunty Cristo, this is between me and her. (to Suzy) You leaked Liza Weld's paper to the BBC. Tell me you leaked it. \nSUZY I didn't leak anything. I don't know what you're talking about. \nJAMIE You're lying. You touched your nose.

Classic.

JAMIE What? \nAdvances on Michael, becomes aware of the music. Jamie points to the CD player. \nJAMIE (CONT'D) Okay for a start turn that fucking row off. It's just fucking vowels. Listen to it. Just subsidised fucking foreign vowels. You only listen to that shit because it's bad form to actually wear a big hat that says \"I went to private school\". \nMichael doesn't turn it off, so Jamie does. \nJAMIE (CONT'D) Who did you leak it to? \nPage 105 \n105   CON TINUE D: (2)                                         105 \nMICHAEL I just sent it.

Oh, that thing about your fax? Don't worry about that. I made that up. The paper was sent by e-mail. It;s just, the fax machine was there and it;s easier to kick. \nMichael looks at Suzy.

I'm just going to - \nMICHAEL Oh. Lovely. I think we could have another bottle of Sancerre. \nTOBY Great. \nSUZY If you can afford it. JUDY If you can get served at the bar. \nHe goes to the bar.

Suzy puts the phone back down. \nTOBY Yeah I wouldn't want to meet Jamie in a dark alley. Or a bright alley. The whole thing of just being in an alley with him would be scary, regardless of the lighting. \nSuzy cuts in. \nSUZY You've got a text. \nTOBY (reading, covering) Oh yeah. It's just Rob about football. \nSUZY So, Liza. You shagged her? \nTOBY What? No. \nSUZY (to Judy) Did you know my flakey boyfriend has been getting his flakey end away? \nJUDY I don't know anything about his flakey end. \nTOBY Could we not talk about accusations and, health issues, in the pub? \nJUDY I should go. \nSUZY You haven't finished your drink. \nJUDY No. I mainly have. \nSUZY Why did you do it? \nTOBY I don't know, it was a weird, intense time over there.

This has been the hardest fucking decision of my political life. I'm not resigning. \nKAREN What the fuck George. Seriously? You said that the war was intolerable and we'd go together. \nGENERAL MILLER It is - it is intolerable. I still agree with myself about that. But I've got to tolerate it. My loyalty is with the kids. At the end of the day I'm a soldier. \nKAREN You're not a soldier. \nGENERAL MILLER Look at the uniform, Karen. I'm not a pastry chef. I have military commendations on my chest, not a little fucking label saying My Name Is George. \nKAREN You're a politician. You live on canapes and white wine and you have three anecdotes you wheel out at every party and you scour the national papers for mentions of your name. You're a fucking politician. \nGENERAL MILLER I'm still a soldier. KAREN When was the last time you shot a guy? \nGENERAL MILLER What, if I haven't shot a guy in 15 years then I'm not a soldier?

Edward:  There it is.  Why would such a notion come into your mind? 
Boy:  They're meat-eaters. 
Edward nods at him.  A different girl speaks. 
Girl:  They have large claws. 
Edward:  Children...  Those We Don't Speak Of, have not breached our borders in many years.  We do NOT go into THEIR woods, they do NOT come into OUR valley.  It is a truce.  We do not threaten them.  Why would they do this? 
At a meeting of the Council of Elders, Vivian Percy is speaking.  She is there, with her husband, Robert, August Nicholson, Victor, Edward and Tabitha Walker, Alice Hunt, Mrs. Clack, three other men, and one other woman.  The women are knitting, since their hands are not needed for the meeting, and they smile and giggle. 
Vivian:  And we ought not to.... overlook The Flight of the Birds.  We didn't have it last year, and I, for one, missed it desperately.  And I know your wife missed the children, dressed in feathers and such. 
Tabitha:  I am fond of it. 
She looks hopefully at her husband. 
Edward:  I do not have a say in this matter.  August Nicholson is chair of today's meeting. 
A door opens at the end of the meeting hall, and all turn to see who has come in.  It is a man with his hat in his hands, respectful. 
Man:  There is a young man who has requested a word with the elders. 
August:  Well, do have him come forward. 
The young man is Lucius Hunt, only son of the widow Alice Hunt.  She jumps a bit when she sees him, but smiles.  He wears denim work-pants, a gray shirt, and a brown jacket.  His hair is a bit curly, but short, and there is a scar on his lip.  He is clearly nervous and sways from one foot to the other.  He holds a note, which he reads aloud.

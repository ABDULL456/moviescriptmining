MCCULLEN (CONT'D) What's on your mind, General? 
HAWK Your warheads. Securing them in transit. Forty pairs of ears in that room now know the when and where. 
MCCULLEN Those "ears" all have top security clearance. 
HAWK We both know what that's worth. 
MCCULLEN Look, General, delivery is my responsibility and it's not one I take lightly. I had NATO assign an elite American Special Forces unit, a fully armored convoy with air support. I assure you, my warheads will be quite safe. 
HAWK I've made a career of showing up where I'm needed, whether ordered to or not. And if your warheads are half as effective as you say they are.. Then my unit is needed. 
MCCULLEN This is no time to play catch up. The NATO team's been drilling for weeks. They're lit up and ready to roll. 
HAWK My unit doesn't need mission specific training. They're chosen because of their ability to handle any situation. 
MCCULLEN Maybe next time, General... (moves to go, stops) What did you say your unit was called? 
HAWK I didn't. I just said they were always ready. McCullen continues on down the hall. Hawk gives Cover Girl a look, she reads it and nods. WE SMASH CUT TO: 
INT. HIGH-TECH DELIVERY BAY - MARS FACTORY - NIGHT 
A FOUR MAN SECURITY DETAIL escorts two LAB WORKERS as they enter a high-tech delivery bay and wlak past two "COUGAR" PATROL VEHICLES and a huge ARMORED "GRIZZLY TRUCK, all armed with state-of-the-art rooftop weapons. FIFTEEN SPECIAL FORCES SOLDIERS stand at attention in front of Duke. 
DUKE All right, listen up, the Cougars will be front and back, Grizzly in the middle carrying the package. Minimum distance at all times. Choppers will cover us overhead. The Lab Workers step up. 
LAB WORKER #1 Captain Hauser. Duke turns to them and start signing forms as WALLACE "RIPCORD" WEEMS takes the case while a little short on academic credentials, Rip is long on confidence, charm, and courage. These two guys are as close as brothers, for better and for worse. Rip looks at the Lab Guy with a jokey grin. 
RIPCORD Not gonna explode, is it? 
LAB WORKER (dead serious) They're not weaponized yet. And the kill switches are attached to the launchers. All the same, I'd avoid potholes if I were you. Ripcord stares, then quickly hand the case off to another soldier. Duke shoots him a look and Ripcord shrugs, what? 
RIPCORD Why not stick it in a chopper and fly it out? If you want, I could-- 
DUKE --We have our orders. Okay, people! We're on the clock, let's move. 
RIPCORD 
MOUNT UP! Duke gives Rip another look. Rip throws him a cheesy grin. The team mounts up. The weapons case to Grizzly. ENGINES ignite. HEADLIGHTS beam. And the convoy rolls out. 
EXT. MARS FACTORY - KYRGYZSTAN - NIGHT 
The convoy charges out of the heavily guarded factory gates, passing a sign: "MILITARY ARMAMENTS RESEARCH SYNDICATE". Two BLACKHAWK HELICOPTERS swoop in and follow the convoy. 
INT. LEAD COUGAR - MARS FACTORY - NIGHT 
Ripcord drives the lead Cougar, Duke beside him. Two more guys in back, remotely panning a rooftop DUAL MACHINE GUN. 
DUKE (into radio) Mother Goose, this is Bird Dog. We have the package and are on the dot to make Ganci Air Base ar 0900. 
RIPCORD You know, I hate all the Mother Goose, bird Dog crap, I just wish they'd let us say, "Hey, Pete, it's Bill, see ya in a few." 
DUKE Not me, I joined up for the jargon. 
VOICE ON RADIO Roger that, Bird Dog. Mother Goose out. 
RIPCORD Just saying, you know, if I ran things... 
DUKE Rip, if you ran the Army we'd stay up all night, fill our canteen with tequila, and call each other "Bro". 
RIPCORD But we'd be badasses, right Bro? 
DUKE (with a sigh) Yeah, we'd be badasses. Eyes on the road, Rip.

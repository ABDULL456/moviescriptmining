COORDINATOR They were supposed to call you. We don't have any rooms. 
EMILY Nothing? 
COORDINATOR There was a mixup with the dates. Sorry. 
Emily rolls her eyes. Lucy standing there holding a suitcase. 
INT. EMILY'S CAR - DAY 
Through the windshield Lucy watches Emily on a pay phone outside a convenience store. Her back is to us but you can see she's arguing with someone, scratching addresses off a typed list with a ballpoint. 
TIME CUT TO: 
Emily gets in and starts the car, putting on a smile. 
EMILY Hey, are you hungry? Let's get some lunch. What kind of food do you like? 
LUCY There's nowhere for me to go is there? 
Heartbreaking. Emily can't lie. She turns off the engine and leans back with a sigh. Lucy's silence is a plea for rescue. 
EMILY I can't, Lucy, it wouldn't work, I live in this tiny house, I... I'm sorry, I'm not mom material... 
LUCY You don't have to be my mom. Just my friend. 
A ten-year-old girl stranded at a convenience store, suitcase in her lap. Emily stares out the windshield, wrestling with her conscience. 
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
At a round table, Emily addresses the CHILD WELFARE PANEL, six grave-faced administrators. Wayne is here, offering support. 
EMILY I know what it feels like to be that age and be unwanted. It's terrifying. She needs to be with someone she trusts; she trusts me. So much of our time is spent negotiating red tape, I think if we just look at the situation - this one situation, this one child - it's clear what's best for her. 
The head of the panel is a bloated bureaucrat in a polka dot blouse (NANCY). 
NANCY This is highly irregular and I'll tell you right now it makes me very uncomfortable. But since, Wayne, you've spoken so persuasively on Miss Jennings's behalf... 
INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
Emily comes out and nods yes to Lucy who waits with a guardian. As they hug: 
NANCY (V.O.) ...I'm going to go against my better judgement and approve this petition for temporary custody. 
INT. EMILY'S HOUSE - DAY 
Emily walks Lucy through the house, showing her around, tidying things self-consciously. 
EMILY I like to think of it as a glass-half- full situation. Kitchen. Bathroom. Fish. And here, is your room... 
INT. LUCY'S BEDROOM - DAY 
They stop in the doorway. A small office in which Emily has made space for a bureau and a bed. Professional books and backup case files pushed aside on a shelf. 
EMILY Be okay? 
Lucy nods yes. 
LUCY Where's your family? 
EMILY My family... well, I've met my dad twice and my mom's not a part of my life anymore. 
LUCY Why? 
EMILY (choosing her words) Sometimes people have kids and then decide they don't want to be parents. 
Beneath the measured tone Emily's pain is revealed, raw and untouchable, her entire life a rebellion against it. She opens Lucy's suitcase on the bed. Pauses, remembering something. 
EMILY I'm glad you're here. 
Lucy comes over to help unpack the clothes. 
TIME CUT TO: 
Lucy in bed, sipping a cup of tea as Emily brushes her hair. 
LUCY What's this? 
EMILY Chamomile, when I get stressed out it helps me sleep. 
Lucy nods that it's good. Emily brushes her hair. A natural bond between them. 
EMILY None of this ever should have happened, if I could make it go away I would. 
LUCY You did.

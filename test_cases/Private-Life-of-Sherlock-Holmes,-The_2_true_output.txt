HOLMES I suspect it's some sort of plot. 
WATSON You mean somebody wants to lure us into a trap...? 
HOLMES Somebody wants to kill me. 
WATSON Kill you? 
HOLMES That's right. It's a plot to bore me to death. I detest ballet. 
WATSON But this isn't just any ballet.     It's Swan Lake. 
CUT TO: 
INT. THEATRE - NIGHT 
START ON THE CONDUCTOR, in the orchestra pit,   as he gives the downbeat for the second acto music of SWAN   LAKE. CAMERA PULLS BACK TO INCLUDE THE STAGE, with a   mechanical sway crossing the mist-shrouded lake. CAMERA    CONTINUES TO PULL BACK, REVEALING Holmes and Watson, in   evening clothes, occupying a box in the upper tier. 
WATSON (confidentially) You know, of course, Holmes -- that swan isn't really a swan -- it's an enchanted princess. 
HOLMES (bored) H'mmmm. 
On the stage now, the hunters appear, carrying lighted torches. 
BOX 
Watson trains his opera glasses on the stage, Holmes stifles a yawn. 
STAGE 
PETROVA, as the Queen of the Swans, makes her entrance to loud applause. She is in her forties, but splendidly preserved, undoubtedly the greatest ballerina around. 
BOX 
Watson nudges Holmes, who has dozed off. 
WATSON Fabulous woman, don't you think so, Holmes? 
HOLMES (coming to) Who? 
WATSON The great Petrova. 
He hands the glasses to Holmes, who focuses them indifferently on the stage. 
STAGE 
Petrova is making an exit, backwards, on points. 
BOX 
Holmes lowers the glasses, returns them to Watson. 
HOLMES Very strong arches, I must admit. 
WATSON They say twelve men have died for her. 
HOLMES Really. 
WATSON Six committed suicide, four were killed in duels, and one fell out of the gallery in the Vienna Opera House. 
HOLMES That's only eleven. 
WATSON The man who fell from the gallery landed on top of another man in the orchestra. 
HOLMES That makes an even dozen -- in a messy sort of way. 
Watson resumes watching the stage through the glasses. 
STAGE 
Petrova and the dancer playing the Prince go into the famous pas-de-deux. 
BOX 
Watson enjoying himself immensely, Holmes sitting there dourly. The red plush curtain at the rear of the box parts, and a man in evening clothes and a top hat enters. He is in his middle fifties, extremely soigne, and somewhat sinister. His name is ROGOZHIN, and he is Russian. Holmes and Watson look around. 
ROGOZHIN Mister Holmes? 
HOLMES Yes. 
ROGOZHIN I am Nicolai Rogozhin, director-general of the Imperial Russian Ballet. So glad you accept invitation. 
Holmes and Watson start to get up, but he motions them back into their chairs.

SAL Jade, we've been wondering when ya would pay us a visit. 
JADE Hi, Sal, Pino, Vito. 
JADE What's happening, Jade? 
JADE Nuthin' really.  How are you treating my brother? 
SAL The Mook?  Great.  Mookie's a good kid. 
PINO Pop, stop lying. 
SAL Shaddup!  Jade, what can I fix you? 
JADE What's good? 
SAL Everything, but for you I'm gonna make up something special.  Take a seat.  There, that's a clean table. 
Sal moves behind the counter and goes to work.  Pino and Mookie look at each other in agreement, neither likes what he has seen.  This happens to Sal every time Jade is in Sal's Famous Pizzeria. 
ANGLE--TABLE 
Vito sits down with Jade. 
JADE You still letting Pino push you around? 
VITO Who told you that?  He doesn't push me, who told you, Mookie tell you that?  I hold my own. 
JADE Forget about it, Vito.  Forget I even brought it up. 
VITO Pino picks on me, but I don't let him push me around.  Mookie tell you that? 
JADE Alright already. 
EXT: ROOFTOP--DUSK 
The once white-hot sun is now turning into a golden orange glaze as it begins to set.  Ahmad, Cee, Punchy, and Ella dance on the roof around a box that is turned into WE LOVE. Each one is trying to come up with some new moves, a new dance, and a name for it. 
EXT: STREET--DUSK 
Radio Raheem is walking down the block and there is something wrong, something is not quite right.  AHA!  His music is not loud; the rap song begins to drag and finally stops altogether.

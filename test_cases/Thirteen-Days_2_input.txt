RESUME 
Kenny finishes pouring him and Bobby a couple of more shots, discreetly turning a blind eye to the President's pain. 
The President returns from his desk, shirt untucked, disheveled, back stiff.  He eases into his rocking chair. Bobby lies sprawled on the couch.  Kenny sits down.  They all look at each other.  A beat, something like shock. 
KENNY Jesus Christ Almighty... 
They burst out laughing.  An absurd, tension draining moment. They shoot their drinks, Kenny refills. 
KENNY (CONT'D) Call me Irish, but I don't believe in cooler heads prevailing. 
THE PRESIDENT Acheson's scenario is unacceptable.  And he has more experience than anyone. 
KENNY There is no expert on this subject, no wise old man. 
The President stares Kenny in the face, understanding. 
THE PRESIDENT The thing is, Acheson's right.  Talk alone won't accomplish anything. 
Kenny considers the President, his face straight as he says: 
KENNY Then let's bomb the shit out of them. Everyone wants to, even you, even me. (there's a point) It sure would feel good. 
The President sees what Kenny's saying: it'd be an emotional response, not necessarily the intelligent one. 
BOBBY Jack, I'm as conniving as they come, but a sneak attack is just wrong. 
KENNY He's right.  And things are happening too fast.  It smells like the Bay of Pigs all over again. 
Bobby picks up some reconnaissance photos on the coffee table. 
BOBBY As if dealing with the Russians wasn't hard enough, we gotta worry about our own house. 
THE PRESIDENT Tonight, listening to Taylor and Acheson, I kept seeing Burke and Dulles telling me all I had to do was sign on the dotted line.  The invasion would succeed.  Castro would be gone.  Just like that.  Easy. 
The President is rendered mute by a wave of pain.  Kenny and Bobby aver their eyes.  When it passes, the President is hushed, grave. 
THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D) There's something...immoral about abandoning your own judgement. 
Kenny nods, moved.  The President reaches out for the reconnaissance photos Bobby's flipping through.  Bobby hands them to him.  The President looks them over.  And when he speaks, there's humility.  And resolve. 
THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D) We can't let things get ahead of themselves.  We've got to control what happens. We're going to do what we have to make this come out right.  EXCOM is our first weapon. (beat) We'll resort to others as we need 'em. 
EXT. AIRPORT - BRIDGEPOINT, CONNECTICUT - DAY 
SUPER: WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 17TH.  DAY 2 
A LONG SHOT of an ENORMOUS CROWD thronging a bunting-trimmed platform.  The President, barely recognizable at the distance, and a cluster of political VIPS wave from it, smiling. 
Kenny steps INTO FRAME, back here at the fringes of the crowd. 
THE PRESIDENT (O.S.) Doesn't anybody in Connecticut have to work today? 
The crowd goes nuts.  Kenny paces, checks his watch, impatient to be done with the necessary diversion.  Kenny gazes off to his right and spots Scotty Reston, along with half the White House press corps suckered along.  Scotty catches Kenny's look. 
Kenny turns away, but Scotty comes weaving over.  The President continues on, but all we hear is Scotty and Kenny. 
RESTON Kenny!  What happened?  They didn't let me up front, said the President was on the phone the whole time. 
KENNY He was. 
RESTON Yeah?  Who was he talking to?  Acheson? Come on, O'Donnell, everyone's wondering what's going on.  What's Acheson doing in town?  And don't give me some bullshit about DNC think tanks. Acheson's Mr. Cold War. 
KENNY Why don't you ask him yourself?  You can have him on the way home. 
RESTON I'm giving you a chance here: talk to me.  You can influence how this thing unfolds. 
But Kenny stands there, mute.  Reston just shakes his head, knowing for sure something's up.  He turns and heads back for the press corps. 
EXT. STAIRS TO AIR FORCE ONE - DAY 
Kenny and the President climb the stairs to the Presidential plane, the crowd cheering him.  He gives a final wave. 
THE PRESIDENT Let's get out of here. 
KENNY Cheer up, you've neutralized the entire White House Press Corps for a day. 
INT. GEORGE BALL'S CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
EXCOM meets in George Ball's small conference room at the State Department.  Bobby, in shirtsleeves, paces at the head of the table, very, very alone.  All eyes are on him. 
BOBBY No.  No.  No.  There is more than one option here.  If one isn't occurring to us, it's because we haven't thought hard enough. 
McNamara squirms.  The others react in frustration.  CIA chief JOHN MCCONE, sharp, tough, conservative, is harsh. 
MCCONE Sometimes there is only one right choice, and you thank God when it's clear. 
BOBBY You're talking about a sneak attack! How'll that make us look?  Big country blasting a little one into the stone age.  We'll be real favorites around the world. 
ACHESON Bobby, that's naive.  This is the real world, you know that better than anybody.  Your argument is ridiculous. 
MCCONE You weren't so ethically particular when we were talking about options for removing Castro over at CIA. 
And there's nothing Bobby can say to that.  He props himself up on the table, stares at it as if there's an answer in its shiny surface somewhere.  There is only the reflection of his own face. 
BOBBY I can't let my brother go down in History like a villain, like a Tojo, ordering another Pearl Harbor. 
McCone, Acheson, and Taylor share a look.  The last resistance to airstrikes is crumbling.  Finally, Bobby looks up at McNamara.

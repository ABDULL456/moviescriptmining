EXT. ESPLANADE DES CHAMPS-ELYÃ‰ES -- DAY 
MED. SHOT -- GUIGNOL. 
One of the French Punch and Judy shows set up on certain days in the small park alongside the broad avenue between the Rond Point and the Place de la Concorde. At the moment, Judy, as always, is beating Punch with a bat. The sound of CHILDREN laughing and screaming can be heard. 
VARIOUS CLOSE SHOTS -- THE CHILDREN 
Sitting on small benches lined up to face the stage. Their attention is fixed on the show, their belief totally suspended by the play as only children's can be -- laughing at the slapstick, booing the villain, frightened by the perils. 
MED. SHOT -- REGGIE 
Sitting on the last bench, next to some CHILDREN. They are laughing but she isn't -- she just watches, her attention caught up but her face void of emotion. The bench is too low for her, forcing her knees up almost under her chin. 
After a moment, PETER comes up behind her and, stepping over the benches, sits beside her. She doesn't seem to notice. 
[Throughout the following scene the CHILDREN and the ACTORS can be heard in the b.g.] 
PETER Reggie -- ? 
She turns and looks at him for a moment. 
REGGIE (vaguely) Hallo, Peter. 
PETER You telephoned me to meet you. I've been standing on the corner back there -- waiting for you. 
REGGIE I'm sorry -- I heard the children laughing. 
A ROAR from the CHILDREN. REGGIE and PETER turn toward the stage. 
MED. SHOT -- GUIGNOL 
PUNCH and JUDY are arguing loudly. 
TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND PETER 
PETER What's going on? 
REGGIE Don't you understand French? 
PETER I'm still having trouble with English. 
REGGIE The man and the woman are married -- 
CLOSE SHOT -- GUIGNOL STAGE 
PUNCH and JUDY are batting each other on the head. 
PETER'S VOICE (O.S.) Yes, I can see that -- they're batting each other over the head with clubs. 
Finally, JUDY knocks Punch out of sight and a PUPPET wearing a three-cornered hat appears. 
PETER'S VOICE (O.S.) Who's that with the hat? 
MED SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE 
Wearing a hat, he stands off in the background, watching. 
REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.) That's the policeman -- he wants to arrest Judy for killing Punch. 
CLOSE SHOT -- GUIGNOL STAGE 
JUDY and the POLICEMAN are batting one another. 
PETER'S VOICE (O.S.) What's she saying now? 
REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.) That she's innocent -- she didn't do it. 
PETER'S VOICE (O.S.) She did it, all right -- take it from me. 
REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.) I believe her. 
PUNCH's head appears on the other side of the stage, says something, then ducks out. 
PETER'S VOICE (O.S.) Who was that? 
REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.) Punch, of course. 
TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND PETER 
PETER Of course? I thought he was dead. 
REGGIE He's only pretending, to teach her a lesson -- only -- (her face clouding) only he is dead, Peter -- I saw him -- he's not pretending. Somebody threw him off a train. What am I going to do? 
Charles was mixed up in something terrible. 
PETER I wish you'd let me help you. Whatever it is, it doesn't sound like the sort of thing that a woman can handle all by herself. 
CLOSE SHOT -- GUIGNOL STAGE 
JUDY has gotten the upper hand is now batting the POLICEMAN's brains out. 
CLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE as he winces. 
TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND PETER 
PETER Have you got a mirror? (she nods) Give it to me. 
She hands it to him and he holds it in front of her face. 
PETER Right there, between your eyes -- see? Worry lines. You're much too young and too pretty to have anything like that. How about making me vice- president in charge of cheering you up? 
REGGIE (jumping at the suggesting) Starting tonight? 
INT. NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT 
MED. SHOT -- EMCEE. 
He stands on the dance floor in front of a five piece Latin dance band, a spotlight on him, wearing his professional smile as he speaks into a mike. 
EMCEE Bonsoir mesdames et messieurs, good evening ladies and gentlemen, guten Abend, meine Damen und Herren -- ce soir, comme tous les soirs, l'attraction ici, au Black Sheep Club, c'est vous! Venez, mesdames et messieurs, step right up, ladies and gentlemen, kommen Sie her, meine Damen en Herren, avanti, signore e signori -- avanti! 
MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND PETER 
At their table. REGGIE is dressed in a lovely Givenchy dress. 
PETER What was all that? 
REGGIE Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow.

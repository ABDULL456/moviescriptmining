Kate makes eyes at Oonagh, who shrugs innocently. Oonagh goes to kiss Kate, while Matt says goodbye to Simon. 
OONAGH (CONT'D) (under breath) Enjoy yourself - you miserable cow. And turn off that phone. (beat) Are you working tomorrow? 
KATE Yes. Half-day. 
OONAGH I'll see you Tuesday. 
Oonagh kisses Kate and heads off with Matt, leaving Kate standing slightly awkwardly next to a seated Simon. 
SIMON Looks like we've been set up. 
KATE Yes. (beat) Sorry. 
SIMON No. It's not your fault. I mean, I'm fine with it. I mean, I'm happy to meet new people. 
KATE Yes, me too. 
SIMON Why don't you sit down? 
KATE Yes. 
Kate sits down. 
SIMON So you're Oonagh's boss? 
KATE Yes. (beat) Sorry, I'm saying `yes' a lot. 
SIMON Yes. (smiles) You are. 
They share a smile. 
SIMON (CONT'D) Do you want another drink? 
KATE Ye... (smiles) Sure. I can get them. 
SIMON No, it's fine. What do you fancy? 
KATE I'll have another white wine. Anything dry. 
Simon heads off to the bar. Kate watches him go. She allows herself a smile. 
INT. RESTAURANT/BAR AREA - NIGHT 
Harvey stands at the bar and downs a whiskey. Picking up another glass, he turns away, and with drink in hand, approaches a group of people standing around a table. As he nears, a distinguished older man with a healthy main of white hair sees him and momentarily touches the arm of the woman standing next to him. She turns around to see Harvey approaching. 
JEAN Harvey. 
HARVEY Jean. 
Harvey turns his gaze to the white haired man and nods. 
HARVEY (CONT'D) Brian. 
BRIAN Harvey. Good to see you. 
There is a palpable sense of tension in the air. 
HARVEY (deliberately only directed to Jean) So our baby girl is really getting married. Who would've thought? 
JEAN Yes. 
BRIAN Harvey you remember the Watsons. Barry and Jill. 
Harvey turns to a couple, standing nearby. 
HARVEY (slight sarcastic tone) Of course I do. Hell, its been a while. I guess, not since Jean and I split up.

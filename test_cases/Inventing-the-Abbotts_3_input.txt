DOUG She didn't betray Alice! She was just trying to get rid of you so Alice wouldn't try to kill herself again. Jesus Christ, you shit- head, Alice couldn't marry you! 
JACEY I know.    I mean, I do now. 
DOUG Then what the hell did Pam ever do to deserve your revenge? 
JACEY Nothing. (CONTINUED)

DOUG Just your way of evening the score with Lloyd Abbott, right? 
JACEY Right. 
Doug spins and delivers a wild, roundhouse punch that lands brutally on the side of Jacey's face -- the impact knocks him down onto the steps. Jacey's eyebrow has split open, he is blinded by blood. 
DOUG I don't know   you! I don't know who the fuck   you are! You fuck everything.    You fuck everything up! Why did    you have to fuck Pam, too?! 
Doug walks away, leaving Jacey sitting on the steps, clutching a banister for support. He presses his palm to his eyebrow to squelch the flow of blood. 
152     EXT. BRYN MAWR DORMITORY - DAY                                 152 
Doug approaches Pam's dormitory. 
153     INT. BRYN MAWR DORMITORY - LOBBY - DAY                         153 
Doug steps up to the female student CLERK (#2) at the front desk. 
DOUG Pamela Abbott, please.     Tell her Doug is here. 
CLERK #2 She's not here. 
DOUG I'll wait. 
CLERK #2 But she left. 
DOUG What do you mean? 
CLERK #2 She left... last night.

DOUG Where did she go? 
CLERK #2 I don't know. 
DOUG Well, did she go home? 
CLERK #2 No one seems to know. She just took some clothes and left. 
DOUG (lost) Oh, God... no... 
His pain is so clear that it spurs the Clerk's sympathy. 
CLERK #2 Look, I'm not supposed to do this, but... well, I can give you her home address. 
DOUG (explodes with irony) Shit! Yeah, right... (slight beat) I mean... thanks. Thanks anyway. I know her home address. 
154     EXT. ABBOTT HOME - STREET - DAY (DECEMBER, 1959)                  154 
The Abbott house is decked with snow. Doug sits    behind the wheel of the Plymouth. He's parked down the    street. He smokes a cigarette and stares at the house --   the pavement outside the driver's window is littered   with butts. 
155   EXT. SHOP (DOWNTOWN HALEY) - DAY                               155 
Alice comes out on the street laden with packages and shopping bags. She's startled by Doug when he falls in beside her and follows her down the sidewalk. 
DOUG Where's Pam? 
ALICE I don't know. 
DOUG Is she with Eleanor? (CONTINUED)

ALICE I don't know. 
DOUG In Chicago? 
ALICE I don't know. 
DOUG I couldn't find Eleanor's name in the Chicago phone book. 
ALICE Maybe it's unlisted. 
DOUG Well, do you know Eleanor's address?

{"test1_input": "SHARON For good reason. Remember? \nLARRY Let's just leave it. \nShe stares, then... \nSHARON You're still scared of him. \nPissed, he throws his hammer down on the plywood, turns to her. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLARRY I don't think it's a good idea you coming around here in uniform. People see it, they think we're in trouble here. \nSHARON Nice seeing you, too. \nShe walks away.     He frowns, picks up his hammer, goes back to work. \nON STREET \nAs Sharon walks towards the car, she sees a van approaching and she holds up a hand to Robby and calls out... \nSHARON Two more minutes. \nAnd she walks toward the oncoming van, which is parking now. \nEXT. VAN - DAY \nThe van is driven by KATHY, Sharon's brother's wife. Beside her in a car seat is LARRY, JR., four years old. Sharon comes to the rolled down window on the driver's side. She has a warm smile for Kathy and the child. Kathy smiles, too. \nKATHY Hi! Look -- it's your Auntie Sharon. \nSHARON Hey, Champ, my God, look how big. \nShe has a special affection for the boy -- who is subdued, but he smiles a small one for his aunt. She takes one of his hands and they shake in mock formality. \nLARRY JR. Hi. \nSHARON Ow! You hurt my hand with that grip. Whew. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nShe shakes her fingers, and he smiles a bit more. Sharon reaches in and rubs his head in a mock knuckling move. He laughs. She smooths his hair, affectionately. \nKATHY We're bringing Larry his lunch. Hey, it's good to see you. It's been awhile. What? \nSharon is staring at Kathy's badly bruised ear. \nKATHY Oh, I went boom into a low shelf -- chasing after him of course. (nodding to the child) How're you doing? \nSharon pulls her eyes off the bruise to meet Kathy's look -- and connect. \nSHARON I'm semi-okay. I heard about the... ceremony and the party. \nKATHY (embarrassed) Oh. I hope you'll be there. (pause) Really. \nSharon smiles a bit, appreciating the support.       She pats Kathy's arm. \nSHARON Take it easy.    You too, Champ. \nThe boy offers his little hand to shake again. \nSHARON Oh, no. You're not breaking my fingers again. \nThey smile and drive on and Sharon walks toward her car and Robby. \nEXT. CITY PARK - DAY (NEXT DAY) \nWe WATCH moms and kids and a basketball game in the park and PICK UP Catch walking by. Two pre-teens are playing bounce and catch with a rubber ball against a (tennis practice) wall, and one of them misses, and Catch makes a lunge and snags the ball. Instead of throwing it to one of the boys, he fires it at the wall. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nOne of the boys catches it, bounces it off the wall toward Catch. Catch grabs it, and now he's part of this rapid-fire game -- and he's athletic and funny, too, playing hard and mugging and making them smile until... a POLICE CAR comes ROARING down the boulevard, slowing a bit to CHIRP its SIREN a few times -- clearing traffic. Catch glances up and sees... \nCATCH'S POV \nSharon is in the car beside Robby. \nON CATCH \nStunned by the sight of her -- and he doesn't know why. He can't move, can't breathe, eyes fixed on her. The POLICE CAR pulls around a truck and ROARS on -- and that's when he is struck by a memory, a little like lightning. It comes as a quick -- \nFLASHBACK - EXT. FREEWAY - ACCIDENT SITE    - CATCH'S POV \n-- The man near death. Sharon is bending close to him, this all just a sliver of an image, and it jolts him. \nBACK TO SCENE (PRESENT) \nThe police car is now converging with other squads just half a block away. Catch throws the ball back to the boys and runs toward the police incident. The boys watch him go, wondering. \nEXT. CLOSED STORE - DAY \nA police   car is parked askew near this closed store -- as now Robby   and Sharon's UNIT ROARS to a STOP beside it. Two cops   are calling and motioning to them, one holds a shotgun.    This is RAY JULIETTE. \n", "test1_true": "And they are moving. \nEXT. BACK OF CLOSED STORE - DAY \nRobby and Sharon are hurrying around to the back as we hear more POLICE UNITS CONVERGING in front. \nANGLE - STREET \nAs Catch arrives on the scene and sees Sharon and Robby moving around the building to the back. He is still amazed at the sight of her. He decides to follow her, keeping her in sight, driven. \nON SHARON, ROBBY \nThey are scouting through crates and weeds as a young man is flushed from cover at the back of the store and runs from them. \nROBBY Freeze! \nThe man runs on, and Sharon chases with Robby close behind her. Sharon speaks to her shoulder radio mike as she runs. \nSHARON (to radio) Three-A-5, foot pursuit. Suspect fleeing south on Pico Place, young man, green jacket. No visible weapon... (to Robby) Robby! \nROBBY Right behind you! (to man) Stop and lie down with your arms... shit. \nThe man has jumped a fence.   Sharon follows. \nROBBY Careful! \nSHARON I see him! \nShe goes over the fence, then Robby. \nEXT. PARKING LOT - DAY \nThe man runs and Sharon chases. Robby, not far behind glances off to the side, seeing Catch, still following. \nROBBY Citizen on your right!   Hey! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBut Sharon is now closing on the fleeing man who turns suddenly, pointing a handgun! \nROBBY Gun! \nAnd Sharon, wide-eyed, is already pulling her weapon, but not in time. The man is aiming at her and about to fire when he is tackled by Catch. \nCatch and the man go sprawling, and the gun flies out of the man's hand, and Sharon is on him in an instant, pointing her gun at him... \nSHARON Freeze!    Right there! \nCatch scrambles to his feet. Robby joins Sharon and puts his knee in the man's back and cuffs him, then glances at Catch. So does Sharon. But Catch starts to hurry off. \nROBBY Hey!     Wait! \nTwo other cops (Ray Juliette and SANCHEZ) rush toward the suspect on the ground. \nRAY You got him? \nROBBY He was armed. \nRAY Jesus. \nROBBY Citizen took him down. \nRAY No shit!? \nSharon stares across the lot to where Catch has halted. More cops are converging. Ray Juliette and Sanchez move toward Catch, while a sergeant and others surround Sharon and the suspect. In between the crowd of cops, Catch and Sharon glance at each other, during... \nON CATCH \nas the cops reach him. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRAY What happened here? \nCATCH I... just saw it and... I saw the gun, so... \nON SHARON \nROBBY You all right, Pogo? \nShe is shaken, speaks softly. \nSHARON I was dead.   Y'know. \nShe glances toward Catch. (She doesn't recognize him from the accident.) Their eyes meet briefly, but then their attention is pulled to the others. Sharon speaks to her sergeant. \nSHARON He had me.    I was dead. \nON CATCH \nHe is shaken, too.    Sanchez is taking notes as Ray checks his I.D. \nCATCH I was just walking by.      I live near here. \nRay nods, handing the I.D. to Sanchez. \n", "test1_id": 1854, "test2_input": "She says this clipped and fast and even tougher: \nSHARON Every time I close my eyes, I see that goddamn gun pointing at me and I don't know why I'm telling you unless it's because you were there and because I had three drinks, but I'm not ready to go inside and close my eyes and I don't want to go to your place and I don't want to keep driving around, so what the hell do we do? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCATCH Whew. I feel like we're boxing, and you've got me on the ropes. (pause) We'll do whatever you want. \nSHARON What I want  is to know how you happened to  be walking by that parking lot  at that minute. What if you hadn' t been there? \nFor a moment, she shows her fear. \nCATCH I guess we were supposed to meet. \nThey stare a while, then she opens her door. \nSHARON If you want -- you can come in for a minute. \nINT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nAs they walk in, she moves into the kitchen. \nSHARON Want a drink? \nCATCH No thanks. \nShe pours one for herself while he looks about. It's a stiff drink. Now that he's here, her I-don't-want-to- make-a-fool-of-myself alarm is on. She flops on the sofa, watches him. \nSHARON Sit down or something. \nCATCH I'm circling awhile. \nHe's looking around at the clutter of her life -- the intimate details. \nSHARON You're not supposed to look around. I didn't have time to straighten up. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCATCH So... it's more real this way. \nSHARON It's rude. \nHe turns to her. \nCATCH Now that I'm in here, you seem mad about it. \nSHARON I'm not mad. You'll know when I'm mad. I don't usually let somebody in here, but here you are. That's all. Let's talk about something stupid. \nCATCH You first. \nShe smiles in spite of herself. \nSHARON Okay -- one thing I don't believe is that 'supposed to' business. We were 'supposed to' meet. That sounds a little fringy to me, like something you might hear on public access TV. You believe that? \nCATCH Some people say we each give off a particular odor -- that can only be detected by one other person's brain. \nSHARON So, we... smell each other?   Who says that? \nCATCH I have no idea. (as they smile) I'm more in the destiny school, we-met-in-another-life school. Do you believe that? Do you think when we die -- we come back in another form? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHARON You mean like   a duck? No. I think dead is   dead. I've been thinking about   it all day -- and I don't want to   think about it anymore. \nHe looks at her, steps close to her, takes the drink out of her hand, puts it to his lips and drinks it all down. He puts the glass on the table. \nSHARON Why'd you do that? \nCATCH See?   Now you're thinking about me. \nShe gets a half smile, assessing him. Her look is direct, and the attraction is there. He feels it, too, and he deflects it, nodding toward a large photomural of snowcapped mountains. \nCATCH Let me guess.       Colorado. \nSHARON It's Austria, but I can't picture myself in Austria. I'm not good with languages, so I couldn't qualify for the departments over there. \nShe rises and goes to a desk and takes the holstered gun off her ankle. She takes the cuffs off her belt, the mace from her jacket, the shield from her shirt pocket, puts them all in a desk drawer. She takes off her jacket and throws it over a chair. Disarmed, she turns to him. Her look is all wanting and pushing away, almost fierce in her struggle. He sees this. \nSHARON Thanks for... coming up here. \nCATCH Does that mean I'm going? \nSHARON (flustered) No.    You don't have to.    I... \nCATCH You okay now? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHer eyes grow a bit hard, defensive. \nSHARON Oh.    You're here as a medic. \n", "test2_true": "She smiles in spite of herself -- again. He has gotten to her. She wants to fall into this guy, but she's pumping those brakes. They are standing close together. \nSHARON Maybe going is a good idea. \nCATCH Can I come back some time? \nSHARON Why? \nCATCH (shrugs) Must be the smell. \nThat makes her laugh, and her resistance falls away with her surprised laughter, and she puts her hands around the back of his neck. Her touch is electric to him. She is going in for a kiss, and he is retreating. They stare a moment -- and then he suddenly takes her shoulders and lets loose his own longing. It is a hungry and passionate kiss, and in the very midst of it, he breaks off and pulls back, his darkness rushing at him. She is staring, surprised, and he is looking a bit shaken, getting the words out just above a whisper. \nCATCH I better go. \nShe doesn't know what to say. The moment hangs. He leaves. Once he closes the door, the breath escapes her, and she shakes her head -- feeling like an idiot. She lost control. With a stranger. \nSHARON Oh, God. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nCatch leaving Sharon's building in a turmoil of emotions, staring hard at his thoughts -- and he steps into the path of a car. The CAR SCREECHES to a stop, and the scream of those brakes and white light of the head lamps paralyze Catch, and he sees -- \nFLASHBACK - SLIVER OF IMAGE \nHeadlights suddenly washing into a vehicle he is driving. \nBACK TO SCENE    (PRESENT) \nThis sliver of memory jolts HIM -- and then another one comes. \nFLASHBACK - HEADLIGHTS \ncoming closer and the scream of brakes from his memory, and all of this is exploded -- \nBACK TO SCENE    (PRESENT) \nby the angry DRIVER shouting at him. \nDRIVER What the hell do you think you're doing?! \nCatch is numb -- completely shut down there in the middle of the street. The Driver exits his car and comes toward him, raging. \nDRIVER Are you crazy?! \nCatch isn't even aware of him. The man gawks at this -- and now Catch walks off. It is raining. The streets are wet. \nANGLE - RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT \nAs Catch continues his walk, he is still a bit shaken -- but when he passes a parked car with the window half open, rain getting in, he hesitates. He can't just walk on. He looks about. He tests the lock. He opens the door, rolls up the window, closes the door, walks on. \nBut a MAN is just exiting a doorway to the street -- and calls out... \nMAN Hey!    Hey!   What did you do? \nCatch stops and turns in the rain.     The Man hurries toward him, upset, angry. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMAN That's my car!     What the hell were you doing? \nCATCH Nothing.    I just... \nThe Man shoves him. \nMAN I saw you!    What did you take out of there?! \nCATCH No, I rolled up the window.       It's rain... \nThe Man gets in his face, shaky... \nMAN You take my phone?!       Hah?! \nHe shoves Catch again, and Catch's desperate confusion explodes in a surprising reaction, grabbing the Man's jacket front in one hand and not punching him but quickly slap, slap, slapping him, saying... \nCATCH Hey!   Hey!    Wake up!    Wake up! \nThe Man is now speechless, frozen, terrified, as Catch's eyes hold him with a fierceness -- and a sadness. \nCATCH I helped you. (pause) I helped you. \nCatch lets him go, and immediately begins walking away, hunching into the rain, his expression dark and troubled. He gets five steps away and turns. The Man steps back -- but Catch only says... \nCATCH I'm sorry. \nAnd he walks on.        The Man watches him go. \nINT. CATCH'S APARTMENT BUILDING CORRIDOR - NEXT DAY \nCandace, Catch's neighbor, is waiting for the slow, RATTLING ELEVATOR with her son. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nThe elevator door opens -- and there is Catch, seated on a newly-bought wicker chair in the elevator with a small table across his lap, other boxes nearby and a long-stemmed rose in his hand, wrapped for giving. \nCATCH Oh.   Sorry. \n", "test2_id": 1855, "test3_input": "SHARON I'm sorry for... what happened.     I know about the accident. \nELANORA (hopeful) He told you?! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHARON No. I found out, and... I remembered. I was there. \nELANORA Oh.   Yes. \nSharon stares a moment, begins with some of her tough cover in place, over her emotions. \nSHARON I guess he comes here a lot -- to talk to you. \nELANORA He shops for me. Twice a week. \nSHARON Oh. And when he comes here -- he never mentions the past, never talks about the accident? \nELANORA No. \nSHARON And you... let him do that?    All this time? Why? \nELANORA It's what he needs. \nSHARON Walking all over the city like... \nELANORA Like an angel.     Yes. Sweet man. \nSHARON But... you let him get so lost. \nElanora is a bit defensive now. \nELANORA I let him find his own way through it. Why did you come here, Sharon? \nSHARON Because... I want to know how to help him. \nELANORA You are helping him. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHARON I don't think so. \nELANORA Why not? \nSHARON He... he was paying me back, I guess, for the accident, for helping him. That's why he felt... so close to me. But... \nELANORA Is that what you think? \nSHARON But now he probably hates me. I... \nELANORA What happened? \nSHARON I took him to the cemetery, and... \nELANORA The cemetery! \nElanora's look darkens and she begins to shake her head in worry. \nSHARON I thought it might help him... come back, you know? But he wouldn't even go in. He screamed at me. \nELANORA (upset) What made you take him there? \nSHARON For the truth... \nELANORA He knows the truth. \nSHARON But he won't even say it, or... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nELANORA That's his way. That's his way through all this. He made a wall -- around that whole day, that night -- other things, too. He keeps them behind the wall -- his little boy, my daughter. He can't help it. The cemetery?! Do you know how hard it is for me to go to the cemetery? Can you imagine? \nSharon is shaken by this, realizing, crumbling a bit as Mrs. Chu goes on. \nELANORA That's where it stares you in the face -- the loss. And it's too much sometimes. \nElanora takes a breath, acknowledging how upset she is. \nELANORA See? I'm still finding my way through it. And Catch -- it almost kills him to think about it or say it or drive a car or see the place where it happened or... go by the cemetery. \nSHARON I was trying to help him... come back to some kind of life. I... \nELANORA But he was coming back. Do you realize how much he changed in the past weeks? His apartment, his life, his music is coming back. He fell in love! He even got a job, Sharon -- for you. For the two of you. Isn't that coming back? Why do you have to rush? Everybody has to rush these days. \nSharon, battered by the truth of this, is totally exposed now, realizing, admitting. \nSHARON I was scared. I push so hard... when I'm scared. \nELANORA Scared of what? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \n", "test3_true": "Elanora sighs, looking at her, and her anger drains away, studying Sharon's misery. \nELANORA You were finding your way.    What else can we do? You think    I'm always sure what to say to   him, what not to say? I do what    I think is right and hope he   sees the love in it. \nShe shakes her head at Sharon's tears, her warmth showing now, liking this girl. \nELANORA Look at you -- so worried now, so miserable. That's the love in it. \nSHARON Did I... make it worse for him? \nELANORA I don't know. I really don't. But I think he'll see the love in what you did. \nSharon stares, without much hope. She puts out her hand to touch Elanora's, to say goodbye. Elanora takes her hand and holds on a moment, staring into the girl, with strength. Sharon nods and walks off, dark and sad. Elanora watches her go. \nINT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - DAY \nIt's the next day, and Sharon is preparing to go to her parents' renewal of vows. She is at the bottom -- with Catch gone from her life -- but she is doing her best to go through with this. \nWe START ON a table, looking at the invitation and next to that is a wrapped gift. We hear Sharon moving about, see her nervous, half-dressed, speaking to herself. In the b.g. we hear our TRUMPET-BASED MUSIC. Very soulful. \nSHARON I just came by to... wish you well. To... congratulate you and wish you well. Shit. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nShe checks the mirror again, doesn't like the look, starts undressing, comes back to the table with the gift on it, wonders if she should add more decoration to the box. She does, and as the trumpet plays on we -- \nCUT TO: \nSHARON \ndressed differently, re-wrapping the gift and then -- \nCUT TO: \nSHARON \ndressed differently, rewrapping it again and then -- \nCUT TO: \nSHARON \nsitting still in a chair, holding the gift on her lap, looking at the clock, nervous, scared, sad. \nEXT. STREET - DAY (SAME DAY) \nCatch is walking down a commercial street -- no Bob-the- dog, no strolling gait. He is focused, deep-eyed, on a mission of some kind. Our MUSIC CONTINUES over this and on into... \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nThe MUSIC CONTINUES over Sharon driving to the church, parking, taking a deep breath, exiting the car. There is no one else outside the church. The ceremony has already begun. She's planned it that way. She enters the church as the MUSIC FADES OUT. \nINT. CHURCH - DAY \nAs Sharon comes in quietly. The church is not full, but perhaps 50 people sit in the front pews, watching the ceremony at the altar: The priest, Mr. and Mrs. Pogue, altar boys. Sharon moves forward and slips into a pew a few back from the altar. The slight disturbance of people sliding over to let her in causes a few people to glance over. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nOne of them is Kathy. They trade a brief, nervous nod. Then Kathy whispers to her husband... \nKATHY She came. \nWe see Larry grow tense and angry. \nKATHY Don't say anything.   Think of your parents. \nLarry doesn't look at Sharon. The little boy, looking fine in a tiny suit and tie, and being bored, leans to look at his aunt. \nSharon and Larry, Jr. trade a look.     She winks, then settles back in her pew, watches. \nON ALTAR \nWe get our first   look at Sharon's FATHER, Carl Pogue, 62. Standing beside   his wife, a rather big, stolid guy, taken with the moment,   both he and his wife emotional over this. He wears    a hearing aid. The priest is speaking. \nON SHARON \nwatching with a mix of feelings as the mass continues and the vows are renewed, the priest reciting the rituals. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nThe PRIEST'S VOICE from the church plays over this scene, invoking the blessings, saying the prayers of the mass as we watch Catch continuing his mission, slowing his steps now and pausing at the entrance to the Welston Memorial Chapel. He hesitates. We see the price he's paying and the determination. He walks through the gate. \nEXT. CHAPEL GROUNDS - DAY \nHe walks into a courtyard of several small buildings in a garden setting -- all red brick and ivy, fountains and flowers. He is fighting his way through this, moving closer to one of the buildings. He is nearly alone on the chapel grounds, and, as he reaches the sheltered wall of this building, he is alone. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nThis is a wall   of bronze vaults within the bricks, and on each vault is   a plaque -- a name. His breath shivers in his body as he   struggles to lift his eyes. Slowly, his gaze comes to   rest on a name: \"LAMBERT.\" \nAs he stares, the PRIEST'S VOICE from Sharon's church FADES OUT, and we are left with silence. Catch is shaky,. He takes a step closer to the wall, to the name, to them -- and he tries to speak, but can't. He tries again -- his voice intimate, just above a whisper at first. \nCATCH Annie. Chet. I don't... want you to think I forgot about you. It's just that I... I couldn't find you. (pause) I woke up, and you were gone. Everything was gone. It all just... disappeared. In one minute. I couldn't remember that minute. I lost it. It took me so long to find it. I think I found it all now. I used a calculator. I did. I figured it out. You know... we get about 1400 minutes a day and so I figured it out. I was 33 years old and three months and eight days, so it was... I've got it here... \n", "test3_id": 1856}

{"train": "ANGEL EYES by \nGerald DiPego \nOctober 1999 Seventh Draft/Polish \nFOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY \nFADE IN: \nEXT. CITY STREETS (LOS ANGELES) - NIGHT \nCREDIT SEQUENCE. \nAs OPENING CREDITS play, we study the city's nighttime pulse, ribbons of headlights moving and cross-connecting like blood through the veins of a body -- impressionistic, even beautiful, but what we're hearing is soulful trumpet-based MUSIC, mellow and haunting, the modern classic -- JAZZ sound of a Wynton Marsalis, putting a voice to our story. As CREDITS END, we... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nPOV - EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT \nNow the MUSIC is GONE, SOUNDS are MUFFLED and vision blurred. We get the impression of urgent movement. We hear BREATHING. There are VOICES, SHOUTS, even SCREAMS, but MUFFLED, far away. Only the breathing is distinct. We come to realize it is our breathing, and we are inside someone, looking out. The man whose POV this is is on the edge of consciousness and not far from death. He lies on the pavement of a freeway at the site of an accident only minutes after impact. \nHis VISION goes IN and OUT of clarity. People are swarming around him and rushing by toward the carnage of wrecked vehicles. A SIREN BLOOMS in the distance and approaches haltingly. The man slips away, comes back toward consciousness, slips again. \nThe crowd around the downed man parts to allow passage to a police officer. It is a woman, Officer SHARON POGUE, LAPD. She kneels at the man's side, taking charge, speaking, but we hear only SLIVERS of SOUND. He sees her face clearly now, close above him. \nSharon is   a dedicated professional and more. We see down into her   to a place of real caring. She stares into our eyes and   connects. We begin to hear her now -- and there are more   SIRENS converging in b.g. \nSHARON Can you hear me? (shouting, off) This one's conscious! \nVOICE (O.S.) Paramedics on the way! \nWe are slipping away again. Sharon holds us with her eyes, and she grips our hand. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHARON Wait. Wait. Listen to me.    Can you feel that? \nShe holds on tight.     We see that our hand, held in her own, is bloody. \nSHARON That's my hand. Hold it.    Go on -- as hard as you can. \nWe watch our hand gripping hers, and as we hold on, the sights and sounds around us grow more clear. \nSHARON It's over, and I've got you, and you're safe. You're safe now. You got that? Don't let go. Don't let me go. \nBut our eyes unlock from Sharon's and DRIFT TO a patch of night sky. Her voice fades awawy. Our POV begins TO LIFT, MOVING TOWARD that sky, as the blue-black night begins to turn white. We GO INTO that white light and... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. LOS ANGELES CITYSCAPE - DAY \nWe PICK OUT a police car from the traffic and FOLLOW. The beat being patrolled is a mixed neighborhood with some very rough edges. \nINT. POLICE CAR - DAY \nOfficer Sharon Pogue is driving the car. It is two years since we saw her at the accident site. Her partner, ROBBY LEWIS, sips coffee and keeps one eye on the CAD monitor which lists all area police calls. She slows behind a car that is crawling along, an old 60s car, driven by a young man and woman who sit very close on the bench seat. The car's ENGINE is MISSING and smoking. \nSHARON That car is older than they are. \nROBBY '67 Chevy Impala. \nSHARON That's what I said. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nROBBY Needs a servicing. \nSHARON Don't we all. \nRobby nearly spits his coffee, laughing at what Sharon has said and trying not to choke. Sharon smiles, shaking her head. \nSHARON Get it together, officer. \nAs Robby smiles, Sharon looks ahead at the young couple who each have an arm around the other. She is stroking his neck. He is making gentle circles in her hair. Sharon watches this, and for a moment her eyes reveal a depth that may be loneliness, but she quickly pushes her thoughts away and hits the HORN, startling Robby and startling the people ahead who now disengage and drive on. \nROBBY Jesus, Pogo! Almost spilled my coffee again! You didn't like his hair, or what? \nSHARON I love Elvis hair. They were going two damn miles an hour. \nBut Robby's eyes have caught something on the monitor. \nROBBY Let's roll to this -- fight in progress. \nAs Robby secures that coffee cup, Sharon hits the SIREN and speeds around the car in front of them. \nEXT. CITY STREET - DAY \nAt the same time, a few blocks away, an OLD, FRAIL MAN is carrying two plastic grocery bags that are too heavy for him. \nWalking behind this man is a younger man named CATCH LAMBERT, an attractive man with some scarring on his face. His eyes, deep down, are haunted by something, but there is energy in his step. He is dressed in a relaxed and stylish manner, not expensive. He begins to pick up his pace to catch up to the old man. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHARON Not you, Rob. You're a rare unthreatened male cop with a good marriage, and you like to eat where I eat -- so everything's code four. \nShe STARTS the CAR and starts to back out, and he reaches over and turns OFF the IGNITION. She stares hotly at him -- but then, slowly, she softens, takes a deep breath. \nROBBY Come over    for dinner tonight. I'll call    Charlene. She'd like to see you.     It's been awhile. We'll talk about    it. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nShe STARTS the CAR again, more calm, starts to drive out of the lot. \nSHARON Thanks. But  she'll invite friends, try and fix me up. She's always trying to fix me up so she doesn't have to worry about you and me. \nROBBY She doesn't worry about that. \nSHARON They all worry about that. \nThey both smile wryly, driving on. \nSHARON You don't need to fix me, Robby, or fix me up. I don't want some guy to heart and soul me and then walk away 'cause he can't stand the cop thing -- or worse: he wants cop stories every night 'cause it turns him on, and he has no idea who I am inside my head. Anyway, I'm busy tonight. \nROBBY Got some action, huh?    Well, that's promising. \nSHARON Yeah.   Hot and heavy. \nIMMEDIATE CUT TO: \nINT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nShe is on the floor using an exercise rig, sliding into crunches, pushing herself, sweating, alone. We BEGIN DRIFTING TO the rain-spattered window as night sounds filter in, HORNS, SOMEONE SHOUTING, a CAR MOVING BY with THUNDEROUS BASS MUSIC that pulses the very air and RATTLES the LOOSE GLASS of her window. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - NIGHT \nCatch Lambert is walking the wet streets, head down in the rain. Far away we hear that car with a BASS-BLASTING RADIO. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nIn the glow of a street lamp, Catch sees a bright-colored object in the gutter. He picks it up out of the gurgling rain water. It is a small toy, a discarded superhero. He puts it in his pocket, walks on. \nNow the car, the prowling, MUSIC-BLASTING, BASS- THUNDERING CAR turns a corner and begins rollling along slowly -- beside Catch. He glances over, walking on. There are four tough-looking MEN in the car, looking for trouble. The MUSIC is DEAFENING. Catch glances again, walks on. Their eyes follow him like gun barrels. He stops and walks out on the street, moving toward the car, shouting over the music. \nCATCH Hey! You want to turn that volume down? What's your point? \nThe men, incredulous, stop the car and snap OFF the MUSIC in order to make sure they're hearing right. They stare death at Catch. \nDRIVER (MAN) What did you say? \nCATCH What's the point of blasting your music through the whole zip code? Don't you realize there are kids trying to sleep in these apartments -- old people, sick people? \nThey can hardly believe this. \nDRIVER You better watch your mouth, asshole. \nCatch meets the man's look with his own unflinching, haunted eyes. \nCATCH Why?   What're you gonna do?   Kill me? \nCatch's look is not a macho challenge. It's something else -- beyond that, a man somehow without limits. One of the riders in the backseat taps the Driver's shoulder. \nMAN #2 Guy's nuts.   Let's go. \nThe Driver, never breaking his death stare, snaps on the DEAFENING MUSIC and then slowly rolls on, still glaring at Catch. Catch stands in the rain, watching them go. \nINT. CATCH'S APARTMENT CORRIDOR - SAME NIGHT \nCatch is arriving home, soaking wet. He lives in a slightly-seedy three-story. As he walks down the corridor toward his apaprtment, he passes a neighbor's door and notices a set of keys dangling from the lock. He pauses -- and then knocks softly on the door. \nSomeone looks through the peephole and then opens the door -- a young single mother, friendly but with a little caution, too. She recognizes Catch. Behind her is a little boy, (five). The woman's name is CANDACE. Her son is TOMMY. \nCANDACE Hi. \nCATCH Hi.   Your keys are in the... \nHe gestures, and she sees the keys and retrieves them, more friendly now. \nCANDACE Oh, thank you. Thanks a lot. God. I was trying to carry Tommy and all these bags. He was so tired. Of course, as soon as I put him down he had all this energy... \nWhile she is talking, Catch is staring deeply at the boy, who is shy. Catch almost speaks to the boy, wants to, goes halfway to a smile -- but the sight of the kid stirs that layer of darkness in Catch. He nods a good-bye to the mother and is about to go. She thinks about this, as he is turning, and pushes through her remaining caution to say... \nCANDACE Y'know, we were just baking nectarine bars because the peaches weren't ripe. Ever had a nectarine bar? \nHe smiles and seems to want to stay, but he is already retreating. His contact goes only so far -- and no further. \nCATCH Sorry.   Gotta be going. \nAnd with one more glance at the boy, he walks to his apartment, unlocks it and steps in. \nINT. CATCH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nHe walks into a bare living room -- no chairs, tables, lamps, nothing on the walls. He walks into a spotless, never-used kitchen and flips on the light, opens a drawer. \nIn the drawer is a collection of kids' toys, some found, some purchased, mostly plastic figures. The action of opening the door has started some battery-operated animals moving around in there. Now from his pocket he takes the plastic superhero he just found and drops it in and closes the drawer. \nHe walks back into the living room. He sits on the floor, leans back against the wall, his clothes still soaked from the rain. He stares at his thoughts, looking a bit numb -- and lost. \nEXT./INT. DRY CLEANERS SHOP - DAY \nSHARON For good reason. Remember? \nLARRY Let's just leave it. \nShe stares, then... \nSHARON You're still scared of him. \nPissed, he throws his hammer down on the plywood, turns to her. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLARRY I don't think it's a good idea you coming around here in uniform. People see it, they think we're in trouble here. \nSHARON Nice seeing you, too. \nShe walks away.     He frowns, picks up his hammer, goes back to work. \nON STREET \nAs Sharon walks towards the car, she sees a van approaching and she holds up a hand to Robby and calls out... \nSHARON Two more minutes. \nAnd she walks toward the oncoming van, which is parking now. \nEXT. VAN - DAY \nThe van is driven by KATHY, Sharon's brother's wife. Beside her in a car seat is LARRY, JR., four years old. Sharon comes to the rolled down window on the driver's side. She has a warm smile for Kathy and the child. Kathy smiles, too. \nKATHY Hi! Look -- it's your Auntie Sharon. \nSHARON Hey, Champ, my God, look how big. \nShe has a special affection for the boy -- who is subdued, but he smiles a small one for his aunt. She takes one of his hands and they shake in mock formality. \nLARRY JR. Hi. \nSHARON Ow! You hurt my hand with that grip. Whew. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nShe shakes her fingers, and he smiles a bit more. Sharon reaches in and rubs his head in a mock knuckling move. He laughs. She smooths his hair, affectionately. \nKATHY We're bringing Larry his lunch. Hey, it's good to see you. It's been awhile. What? \nSharon is staring at Kathy's badly bruised ear. \nKATHY Oh, I went boom into a low shelf -- chasing after him of course. (nodding to the child) How're you doing? \nSharon pulls her eyes off the bruise to meet Kathy's look -- and connect. \nSHARON I'm semi-okay. I heard about the... ceremony and the party. \nKATHY (embarrassed) Oh. I hope you'll be there. (pause) Really. \nSharon smiles a bit, appreciating the support.       She pats Kathy's arm. \nSHARON Take it easy.    You too, Champ. \nThe boy offers his little hand to shake again. \nSHARON Oh, no. You're not breaking my fingers again. \nThey smile and drive on and Sharon walks toward her car and Robby. \nEXT. CITY PARK - DAY (NEXT DAY) \nWe WATCH moms and kids and a basketball game in the park and PICK UP Catch walking by. Two pre-teens are playing bounce and catch with a rubber ball against a (tennis practice) wall, and one of them misses, and Catch makes a lunge and snags the ball. Instead of throwing it to one of the boys, he fires it at the wall. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nOne of the boys catches it, bounces it off the wall toward Catch. Catch grabs it, and now he's part of this rapid-fire game -- and he's athletic and funny, too, playing hard and mugging and making them smile until... a POLICE CAR comes ROARING down the boulevard, slowing a bit to CHIRP its SIREN a few times -- clearing traffic. Catch glances up and sees... \nCATCH'S POV \nSharon is in the car beside Robby. \nON CATCH \nStunned by the sight of her -- and he doesn't know why. He can't move, can't breathe, eyes fixed on her. The POLICE CAR pulls around a truck and ROARS on -- and that's when he is struck by a memory, a little like lightning. It comes as a quick -- \nFLASHBACK - EXT. FREEWAY - ACCIDENT SITE    - CATCH'S POV \n-- The man near death. Sharon is bending close to him, this all just a sliver of an image, and it jolts him. \nBACK TO SCENE (PRESENT) \nThe police car is now converging with other squads just half a block away. Catch throws the ball back to the boys and runs toward the police incident. The boys watch him go, wondering. \nEXT. CLOSED STORE - DAY \nA police   car is parked askew near this closed store -- as now Robby   and Sharon's UNIT ROARS to a STOP beside it. Two cops   are calling and motioning to them, one holds a shotgun.    This is RAY JULIETTE. \nSANCHEZ Sergeant's going to want to talk to you, Mr. Lambert. We'll need a statement. \nRAY Don't worry about it. That's just procedure. Look -- we appreciate what you did. No bullshit. Let us buy you a drink tonight, all right? You know where the Rib House is? \nCatch glances at Sharon again, and he nods. \nEXT. UPSCALE RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY (SAME DAY) \nCatch, a bit bruised and dirty from his tackle, is carrying groceries up the walkway steps to a small, well- kept home. He is taking out a key as he walks to the covered portico. \nINT. MRS. CHU'S HOME - DAY \nELANORA CHU, 60, is an attractive woman with warmth and intelligence in her eyes. She is in a wheelchair, at a writing table where she carefully translates an English text into Chinese characters. \nShe glances up as Catch opens the front door and heads for the kitchen, speaking as he goes, not looking at her or into the living room at all. \nCATCH I got you nectarines because the peaches are hard as rocks. \nELANORA Your jacket's all dirty. \nShe rolls away from the table in her motorized chair -- and as they speak across the house, she performs a ritual... \nCATCH (O.S.) I tackled a guy. \nElanora is moving about the living room, picking up framed photographs and turning them face down. We don't see what -- or who -- is in these photos. She is turning them all in a routine way, used to this. \nELANORA Why would you 'tackle' a guy?! \nCATCH (O.S.) Why do you think? \nINT. KITCHEN - DAY \nCatch is at the cupboards, putting away groceries as Elanora rolls into the kitchen, her CHAIR HUMMING. \nCATCH He had the ball. He was going for a touchdown. \nELANORA Can you be serious? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCATCH (as he works) What day is today? \nELANORA Wednesday. \nCATCH No. \nThey are not smiling at their little jokes, but they have an ease with each other and the deep love of dear friends. He doesn't pause in his work, but we can see some nervousness in him as he says... \nCATCH Met somebody today. \nMrs. Chu is now taking some of the groceries out of the bags to help. \nELANORA Oh? That's good. Ahh -- they had the broccolini today. Thank you. \nCATCH A woman. \nElanora is more interested and curious now, still helping with the groceries and being casual. \nELANORA You didn't tackle her, too, did you? \nCATCH No. \nELANORA Good, Catch. \nCATCH She's a police officer. \nELANORA (stops; worried) Are you in trouble? \nCatch goes on working, a depth in his eyes. \nCATCH No.   No trouble. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nElanora watches him work and gladdens slightly.     We see her own depth of feeling. \nELANORA Well... that's a good thing. \nHe is still working, but his eyes are on his thoughts, his struggle. \nCATCH I saw her once a long time ago. \nElanora stares a moment.      This has meaning for her. \nELANORA Where? \nHe doesn't answer.      He's nervous about this. \nCATCH She looks the same. \nNow she watches him as he moves to the refrigerator and continues his work in silence. \nINT. RIB HOUSE - THAT NIGHT \nIt's a noisy restaurant with a large bar area. We PAN TO a booth of off-duty cops, out of uniform now, including Ray, Sanchez, Sharon and a few more male officers. They're all a bit high. Sharon shows the signs, too. They are passing around a photo now as one COP looks at it and says... \nSHARON You look familiar. \nCATCH I guess I live on the beat you patrol. \nHer way to cover nervousness is to be blunt, even tough. \nSHARON Why would you do that -- jump a man with a gun? \nCATCH (shrugs) He was going to shoot you. \nSHARON He could've shot you. You have a death wish? You a bungee jumper? \nCATCH No. I didn't have time to think about it. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHARON What d'you think about it now? \nCATCH I figure... it was worth the risk. \nSHARON For someone you don't even know? \nCATCH Yeah -- and for what you do. I think cops are great. Out there, trying to keep it safe. You know? Tough job. Firemen are everybody's heroes. Kids wave at firemen. People should wave at cops. Did you ever think about how many people are walking around this town because you saved them? \nSHARON I never thought about it. \nCATCH ... because you helped them or because you arrested somebody who would've hurt them or because you just... did your job? \nSHARON Now I'm walking around this town because of you. Ever think about that? Maybe you should be a cop. \nCATCH I don't know... I look pretty dumb in a hat... \nHe has made her smile. \nCATCH ... and I don't drive and, like I said, I don't talk to many people. Am I talking too much? I am. You go ahead. \nSHARON Okay. What d'you do? You employed around here? Oh, God. Sorry. Every time I try to talk to somebody, it comes out like an interrogation. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCATCH Where do you want to be ten years from now? \nSHARON What? \nCATCH Somebody taught that to me. Kind of a shortcut. You ask somebody, what are your plans for tomorrow -- what're your dreams for ten years from now. It's supposed to get things started. \nSHARON Does it work? \nCATCH I never tried it. \nSHARON Bullshit. \nCATCH No. Really. I just remembered it -- God is my witness. \nSHARON Not in here.    It's mostly cops. \nNow she has made him smile, the first real smile we've seen from Catch. It's open and real and she is charmed by it. \nSHARON You have a nice smile. \nShe's a bit self-conscious, saying that, and just as she says it, the waitress arrives with shots and beers for both of them. Sharon looks up, questioning, and the waitress nods toward the booth. Catch and Sharon see the cops, staring, smiling, raising their glasses. There is a hint of teasing in their grins. And now Sharon is more self-conscious, and a bit tough again, taking her drink and turning back to Catch. \nSHARON So... what were we talking about? Oh, yeah, you were giving me some line about starting a conversation. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCATCH The shortcut. \nSHARON Okay.    I'll play. \nThey clink glasses and drink.         Then... \nSHARON Tomorrow I've got a night watch shift. If the weather clears, in the morning I'll go hiking. If it rains, I'll go to the gym -- and the laundromat. Ten years from now... I want to be living in some mountainous place. \nCATCH Tibet? \nSHARON Could be Tibet. Could be Colorado. Your turn. \nBut now Ray Juliette is approaching the table. \nRAY Hey, Pogo -- don't keep him all to yourself. Come on over, Lambert, join the group. We'll buy you dinner, give you a medal for saving Pogo's ass. \nSharon drains her shot and stands. \nSHARON Actually, I'm kind of tired, Ray. I'm taking off. \nCATCH Oh.     I'll... walk you to your car. \nCatch stands and turns to Ray. \nCATCH Thanks for the drink. \nRAY Least we could do. We don't like her very much -- but we don't want to lose her. \nShe says this clipped and fast and even tougher: \nSHARON Every time I close my eyes, I see that goddamn gun pointing at me and I don't know why I'm telling you unless it's because you were there and because I had three drinks, but I'm not ready to go inside and close my eyes and I don't want to go to your place and I don't want to keep driving around, so what the hell do we do? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCATCH Whew. I feel like we're boxing, and you've got me on the ropes. (pause) We'll do whatever you want. \nSHARON What I want  is to know how you happened to  be walking by that parking lot  at that minute. What if you hadn' t been there? \nFor a moment, she shows her fear. \nCATCH I guess we were supposed to meet. \nThey stare a while, then she opens her door. \nSHARON If you want -- you can come in for a minute. \nINT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nAs they walk in, she moves into the kitchen. \nSHARON Want a drink? \nCATCH No thanks. \nShe pours one for herself while he looks about. It's a stiff drink. Now that he's here, her I-don't-want-to- make-a-fool-of-myself alarm is on. She flops on the sofa, watches him. \nSHARON Sit down or something. \nCATCH I'm circling awhile. \nHe's looking around at the clutter of her life -- the intimate details. \nSHARON You're not supposed to look around. I didn't have time to straighten up. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCATCH So... it's more real this way. \nSHARON It's rude. \nHe turns to her. \nCATCH Now that I'm in here, you seem mad about it. \nSHARON I'm not mad. You'll know when I'm mad. I don't usually let somebody in here, but here you are. That's all. Let's talk about something stupid. \nCATCH You first. \nShe smiles in spite of herself. \nSHARON Okay -- one thing I don't believe is that 'supposed to' business. We were 'supposed to' meet. That sounds a little fringy to me, like something you might hear on public access TV. You believe that? \nCATCH Some people say we each give off a particular odor -- that can only be detected by one other person's brain. \nSHARON So, we... smell each other?   Who says that? \nCATCH I have no idea. (as they smile) I'm more in the destiny school, we-met-in-another-life school. Do you believe that? Do you think when we die -- we come back in another form? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHARON You mean like   a duck? No. I think dead is   dead. I've been thinking about   it all day -- and I don't want to   think about it anymore. \nHe looks at her, steps close to her, takes the drink out of her hand, puts it to his lips and drinks it all down. He puts the glass on the table. \nSHARON Why'd you do that? \nCATCH See?   Now you're thinking about me. \nShe gets a half smile, assessing him. Her look is direct, and the attraction is there. He feels it, too, and he deflects it, nodding toward a large photomural of snowcapped mountains. \nCATCH Let me guess.       Colorado. \nSHARON It's Austria, but I can't picture myself in Austria. I'm not good with languages, so I couldn't qualify for the departments over there. \nShe rises and goes to a desk and takes the holstered gun off her ankle. She takes the cuffs off her belt, the mace from her jacket, the shield from her shirt pocket, puts them all in a desk drawer. She takes off her jacket and throws it over a chair. Disarmed, she turns to him. Her look is all wanting and pushing away, almost fierce in her struggle. He sees this. \nSHARON Thanks for... coming up here. \nCATCH Does that mean I'm going? \nSHARON (flustered) No.    You don't have to.    I... \nCATCH You okay now? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHer eyes grow a bit hard, defensive. \nSHARON Oh.    You're here as a medic. \nHe rises and hurriedly gets his purchases off the elevator so the woman and little boy can enter. \nCANDACE Shopping day? \nHe smiles at her, a bit less subdued than before as he gets his things into the hall -- and he manages a special look for Tommy, a wink. He frees the elevator; they step inside. As the door starts to close, Catch's face \"follows\" the sliding door with a funny look for the boy. We hear Tommy laugh as the door closes. Catch carries his new possessions to his apartment. \nEXT. OLDER HOUSE - LATE DAY \nA well-kept older home, well-planted, pretty. A woman of nearly 60 is tending the flowers. She hears someone approaching the gate in the wooden fence. She looks up. Sharon is at the gate, in uniform, on her dinner break. The older woman is her MOTHER, Elaine Pogue. There is an old strain between them, a sadness -- and a nervousness in Elaine. She's a quiet woman. She smiles at her daughter as Sharon comes through the gate. They hug tentatively, a lot of baggage here. Sharon turns to the garden. \nSHARON It's looking great, Mom. \nMOTHER (pleased) Thanks, honey. It's the best year ever for the impatiens. The very best. \nThere is a beat of awkward silence. \nMOTHER Let's go in. \nINT. POGUE HOME - DAY \nAs they enter. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nIt's a bit dark inside, older furniture, lots of keepsake clutter and photos. Sharon is restless in here -- bad memories. \nSHARON Looks the same. Still smells like cigarettes. I thought he quit. \nMOTHER He's down to six a day. \nSHARON Your hair looks nice. \nHer Mother touches her hair, self-consciously. She can't help glancing at her daughter in all that gear -- bullet-proof vest under her shirt, radio, cuffs -- and that gun. \nMOTHER Are you well? \nSharon steps close to the mantel. There is a photo of her there, graduating from the police academy, a professional, not a family shot. She is surprised. \nSHARON I guess I'm well. Is this always here? \nMOTHER Yes.   It's always there. \nSHARON Did Larry tell you I came by where he's working? Is that why you called me? \nMOTHER I called because we want to invite you to our renewal of vows. It's three weeks from Saturday. \nSHARON Who's 'we.'     You said 'we' want to invite you. \nMOTHER The family. \nSharon takes that in, still looking about. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHARON How come you're renewing your vows? \nMOTHER It's sort of... a fresh start. \nSHARON Your idea? \nMOTHER No. Both of us. It's a way of... having the marriage blessed. \nSHARON Wasn't it blessed before? \nHer Mother sighs, sad for all the trouble between them. \nMOTHER Sherry... of course it was blessed. You just... \nSHARON I just what, Mom? \nMOTHER You just think about the bad, and you never remember the good. I wish you remembered the good. \nSharon stares deeply at her. \nSHARON Sorry.  I wish I did, too. (then, almost like a child) Does he? Remember any good about me? \nMOTHER Of course. He doesn't hate you. He just... still feels hurt. \nSHARON Hurt?    I hurt him? \nMOTHER Being arrested like that. Somebody doesn't forget that. \nSHARON Oh? How come you forgot what he did? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMOTHER It wasn't as bad -- you always make it sound worse. And it hasn't been that way for years. \nSHARON I'm glad it hasn't been that way. That means it worked, Mom. That was the point. That's why I did it. Christ. Why do I get punished for it? \nMOTHER Honey, nobody's punishing you. We're inviting you. Will you come? \nSHARON Of course I'll come. \nINT. DENNY'S - MORNING \n... and now it's 8:38, and Catch is still waiting and watching. \nINT. SHARON'S BEDROOM - MORNING \nShe is still in bed, under the sheet. Someone begins KNOCKING on her door and she sits up, bleary and frustrated. \nSHARON Damn it! \nShe stumbles out of the bedroom to her door. \nSHARON What?!     Who?! \nCATCH (O.S.) It's me. \nSHARON Oh, Jesus. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nShe opens the door.    He wears a stern look.     She is not apologetic. \nSHARON I was just falling asleep. Finally. \nCATCH We made a date. \nSHARON It wasn't a 'date.' \nCATCH Okay, an 'appointment.'     I keep my appointments. \nShe gives an exasperated moan and turns to stagger back to bed. He closes the door and follows. \nSHARON I called you.    I called you at seven. \nCATCH I get up early. I walked there. I waited there. \nSHARON Check your messages. \nShe heads for the bed, passing a     mirror, looking at her rumpled self and groaning at the     sight.  She climbs into bed and snuggles there and puts     the sheet over her head. He is entering the bedroom. He      carries a Denny's take- out bag. \nSHARON (under the sheet) I need more sleep. Come back in a month. \nCATCH Come back? What makes you think I'd come back here? \nThe lump under the sheet says... \nSHARON Then why are you here? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCATCH I'm here to tell you that when you tell someone you're going to be somewhere then that someone rearranges his life and you should be more aware of that and a lot more considerate instead of just... \nShe has come out from under the sheet and is watching him. \nSHARON What's in the bag? \nCATCH What?   None of your business. \nSHARON Did you bring some coffee? \nCATCH You think you deserve coffee? \nSHARON What else did you bring?   Food? \nCATCH (opening the bag) You definitely don't deserve food. I've got coffee, sugar, sweetener, non-dairy... \nSHARON Just black.   Black. Thanks. \nShe sits up. He hands her the coffee.         She sips, relishing the sip, then studies him. \nSHARON So what kind of life did you rearrange in order to get to Denny's? You never said one word about yourself last night. What d'you do? \nCATCH What's the difference? \nSHARON What's the difference?! You're standing in my bedroom. That's the difference. Who are you? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCATCH Somebody who keeps appointments. \nSHARON You're ducking. Don't duck. (then a thought) Oh, shit -- you're married, right? \nConvinced -- she picks up one of the throw pillows from the bed and tosses it at him. \nCATCH I'm not. \nSHARON I don't believe you. \nCATCH You don't believe me?   Give me back the coffee. \nSHARON No. \nCATCH Give me the coffee. \nShe looks at him, looks at his empty place, his non-life, and back at him again. \nSHARON I don't know.    I just don't know. \nShe breaks off the stare and heads for the door.     He watches her go. \nEXT. UPSCALE NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY (SAME DAY) \nAs Catch charges up the stairs to the wide porch of Mrs. Chu's well-kept home, carrying a grocery bag, head full of his thoughts. \nINT. MRS. CHU'S HOME - DAY \nAs Catch enters. She is watching TV. He does glance into the living room briefly to throw her a quick hello smile, before moving to the kitchen. She SNAPS OFF the TV and begins turning the photos face down as she sends her voice to the kitchen. \nELANORA I remember that. That was a smile. \nINT. KITCHEN - DAY \nHe is putting groceries away as she rolls into the room. He doesn't look at her, tries to be casual, but his thoughts are bubbling out. \nCATCH You know the cop -- the woman cop? She... visited me. \nMrs. Chu registers surprise at this, but keeps it covered and casual. \nELANORA Oh?   Where did she sit? \nCATCH I have a chair now. \nELANORA You're... seeing her? \nHe darkens a bit as he works. \nCATCH She has a lot of questions.    She wants to know everything. \nELANORA Of course she does. Everybody does. \nCATCH We could start from today.    What's so wrong with that? \nELANORA Tell her. \nThe can in Catch's hand bangs on the cupboard, and he stops, suddenly uptight. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCATCH Tell her what? \nMrs. Chu comes closer. \nELANORA Tell her, Catch. Tell somebody. It's been almost two years. \nCATCH (a warning) Nora... \nELANORA Every time I tell somebody, it gets a little bit easier. I'm not saying it goes... \nHis next warning is tough and absolute. \nCATCH Nora! \nShe is silenced. The moment hangs. She rolls her chair to him, takes a box of cookies out of his hand, opens the box and eats one, defusing the moment. \nELANORA She nice? \nHe starts to work again. \nCATCH She's tough. \nELANORA She pretty? \nCATCH That doesn't matter. \nELANORA (smiles) She is pretty. \nCATCH She's sort of pissed-off at me. \nELANORA Apologize. \nCATCH For what? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nELANORA It doesn't matter. We like it when men apologize. \nHe stares at her a while. \nCATCH I'm sorry I yelled at you. \nShe smiles and hands him the box. \nELANORA Have a cookie.     See? \nINT. POLICE REPORT ROOM - NIGHT \nSharon is typing at the computer, dark and dogged in her work.  Lieutenant Sanderman is watching her through the glass wall of the watch commander's office. He comes out of the office and moves to where Sharon is typing. \nSANDERMAN Sharon... \nLARRY That's not your business! Nobody called you, right? She didn't ask for you to come here. This is my family. You don't get it, 'cause you've got no family. Nobody. So you try to run everybody else's life. Jesus Christ -- get your own life. That's the goddam problem. Get your own goddamn life. \nTheir stare holds, but she is giving way. \nSHARON Okay. I'm sorry I came here.       I'm sorry I hit you. Okay? \nLARRY Okay what? \nThis is very hard for her. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHARON Don't go to my department, all right? \nLARRY Why the hell not? \nSHARON Larry... \nLARRY Why not?! \nSHARON Because the job's all I got. \nLARRY That's what I said, right?    No life. \nShe nods, her voice smaller, almost a whisper. \nSHARON That's what you said. \nHe makes her wait, thinking it over. \nLARRY And you won't come around here. You won't call. Ever. \nIn a moment Sharon nods. \nLARRY And I don't want you to come to Mom and Dad's celebration... \nHer eyes snap to his, surprised. \nLARRY Not the church. Not the party. Stay away. I don't want you around. I don't want to see you, Shar. \nAfter another moment, she nods again -- and he snatches the photo out of his shirt pocket and pushes it against her chest and walks away. The photo falls to the ground. Larry says without turning... \nLARRY Go get a life. \n... and she snaps. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHARON I got a life! \nThe words burst out of her, thick with tears, but she's not crying. Larry stops and turns. \nSHARON How the hell would you know about my life?! \nLARRY I know. \nSHARON You know nothing about me, because you don't want to know. The family doesn't want to know me. Well, too bad. Sharon's got a life. Sharon's got a boyfriend. Sharon's going hiking in the morning with her boyfriend. She's not sitting alone miserable like you want. Too bad! \nShe reaches down, snatches the Polaroid photo off the ground, walks to her car, enters and slams the door as hard as it is possible to slam it. \nEXT. SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS - DAY \nMoving through the panorama are two small figures on a hiking trail, traveling uphill on a ridge. \nON SHARON, CATCH \nSharon is pounding along, barely out of breath. She studies the beautiful view, and it helps her. It lifts her. Catch is falling behind, breathing heavily. \nCATCH Hey. Hey!   Can you wait up a minute?! \nShe waits.     He catches up. \nSHARON I thought you walked all over the city. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCATCH (gasping) The city is flat. Okay? Can we stop here? Can we examine the view? Have a Milky Way? I've burned every calorie I ever had. \nBut she walks on. \nSHARON My favorite lunch spot is another half mile. \nCATCH Up?! \nShe smiles and walks on, and he follows, calling out. \nCATCH I'm not one of those competitive guys, you know! \nEXT. POND - DAY (BIT LATER) \nSharon is already unpacking their lunch as Catch trudges up and collapses near a stream-fed pond. She hands him a sandwich, but he shakes his head. \nCATCH No thanks. I can't eat and have a heart attack at the same time. \nSHARON You don't know anything about it. So forget it. \nCATCH Well... I know about family. \nSHARON Oh, yeah?   What about it? \nCATCH It's... a door you don't close. \nSHARON I didn't close the door. \nCATCH You're closing it now. Right? Family invites you, you go. Family shows up, you welcome them in. That's family. \nSHARON Oh, sure. What if they don't deserve it? \nCATCH Then you forgive. \nSHARON You have all the answers. \nCATCH No. I just... It seems like a chance, doesn't it? A chance to make things right. I'd take it. Then you tried -- y'know? And it's up to them. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSharon is considering his words, but she's also deep in her old pain, defensive, challenging. \nSHARON You close with your family? \nThat hits him, but he keeps rubbing her, gentle now, looking a little lost. He doesn't answer. \nSHARON See?    So why should I listen to you? \nBut as he works her back in silence, we see her facing her pain and thinking through it. \nINT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - NEXT MORNING \nJust after dawn. Catch is on the couch, stirring in his sleep, in the grip of an unsettling dream. We hear what he hears: the VOICES of his wife, his son, murmurings. We're not sure of the words, even laughter. Catch's eyes snap open, jolted out of sleep, but the VOICES don't stop, and he suddenly sits up. The VOICES FADE as he catches his breath, gulping air. He tries to calm down. In a moment, he rises and moves to Sharon's bedroom. \nINT. BEDROOM - MORNING \nHe comes to the side of the bed and sees that she is asleep. He sits on the bed and studies her, his dark thoughts dissipating as he watches her sleep, his eyes going deep. In a moment he begins to raise a hand to brush her cheek -- the way awakened her before -- but he stops before touching her. Instead, he brings his face close to her and lightly kisses her. \nShe stirs. He kisses her again. She opens her eyes. They stare at each other. She raises a limp hand and touches his face. He begins to come close, slowly, for another kiss. She welcomes it. They kiss on the mouth, very tenderly. They kiss again -- deeper. They kiss again, and she holds him, and he moves fully onto the bed, lying over her and supporting his weight on his elbows and kissing and kissing and letting go for once, hungry for her because she is in his heart now, and she is a salvation, and there is a moment when they both pause and stare clear-eyed, acknowledging what they are doing, and both of them abandon their fear and pain and begin to smile, and they make love that way, smiling, as we slowly... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. BLUES CLUB - NIGHT \nThe night of that same day finds us at this neighborhoody place with a lot of down-to-earth atmosphere and not a lot of noise, like Harvell's in Santa Monica -- earthy blues and jazz from a small band in a darkish club, small dance floor. We PAN during this slow number and ARRIVE AT a few dancing couples, including Sharon and Catch who mostly just hold each other and sway. When their eyes meet, there is a lot of deep pleasure there. \nThe music ends. The small crowd applauds. Couples head back to the tables, but the little band goes right into a more up-tempo but still earthy blues. Sharon stops and pulls Catch back onto the dance floor. He smiles and follows. \nThis number has a driving beat, and, slowly, we watch Sharon drop her inhibitions and become more and more   free out there, and Catch is smiling and wowed by her, and   she laughs, wowing herself, and she keeps going, getting   wild and playful, and it's something to see. We LINGER ON    the joy and abandon. She's earned it. They go a little crazy, happy crazy, and in a while we... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nSAME - HOURS LATER \nThe blues club is emptying out. It's late. The band is finishing what seems to be its last number, for the last of thinning crowd -- including a tired, happy Sharon and Catch who applaud the end of the number. Catch stares at her. \nCATCH What's your favorite song? \nHe rises -- as if to go to the band with a request.     She smiles, spent. \nSHARON Catch, I'm beat. So are they.   I think they're finished. \nCATCH One more.   It's a surprise. \nShe watches as he leaves her, walks to the bandstand.     He talks to the leader who is the PIANO PLAYER. \nSHARON'S POV \nFrom the instrument cases on the floor behind the piano, Catch picks up a trumpet case, opens it. Now Sharon's tired smile is changing to curiosity, wonder. \nON CATCH \nAs he puts the mouthpiece on the horn, nervous, but excited, too, speaking to the Piano Player. \nCATCH Thanks, Danny. \nDANNY (PIANO PLAYER) Gonna be good having you back, Catch. \nCatch comes to the edge of the bandstand, grinning a bit at Sharon, at his surprise for her, nervously fingering the horn. He puts it to his lips. \nON SHARON \nMouth-open surprise -- and then smiling with the wonder - - and Catch begins to play, closing his eyes and rendering a ballad, like the haunting \"ANGEL EYES.\" \nSharon's smile slowly fades, replaced by a much deeper look, not only because he is so good, but because he is showing her his heart, his love and even his pain -- more than he can show her any other way. We INTERCUT as he opens his eyes briefly, watching her, sending her the music, closing his eyes again to fall into the song -- as Sharon's eyes fill at the beauty and sadness of it, and at this look inside her man. We LINGER. Then... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. CLUB - NIGHT \nWe keep the sound of CATCH'S TRUMPET going as he and Sharon exit the club and begin to stroll away, arms around each other. In a moment, he stops. He can't go another step. He has to kiss her. He holds her face and comes in for the kiss, and above the music we hear her say softly. \nSHARON Where I've never been kissed. \nHe stops and stares a moment, then takes her hand and walks her out into the middle of the traffic-less boulevard and there, in the center of the street, kisses her, and she responds, and it is their finest, fullest moment, lifting on the MUSIC, and it is ironic and prophetic that at its peak they are washed over by the revolving light from a police car and a SIREN that CHIRPS once as they break, staring. \nShe has entered the park and witnessed this from a distance. She is angling toward the playground. \nON CATCH \nHe watches Tommy at play with the figures, but it's almost too much for him. He touches the boy and rises, smiles and nods at Candace and begins to walk off. \nON SHARON \nShe hurries her steps to intersect with Catch. \nON CANDACE, TOMMY \nCANDACE Wow, Tommy -- Look at them all. Did you say thank you? \nNow Tommy looks up. Catch is moving away with Bob, walking home. Tommy stands up, Candace calls out to stop Catch. \nCANDACE Excuse me! \nON CATCH \nBut he is walking on, some of the emotion seeping through, not darkness, some old joy welling up. We see, in b.g., Tommy starts to run after him to say thanks. We now have a convergence of Tommy, Sharon and Catch, who is moving steadily toward the street, crossing a bike path now. A BIKER is coming on. All in one moment Catch hears the WHIZZ of the BIKE, Tommy calling out \"Thank you,\" and Candace shouting \"Be careful!\" And Catch goes cold inside and turns quickly and rushes onto the bike path, taking the collision with the bike so Tommy is sure to be safe. Catch and the biker fall hard. Sharon stops -- holding her breath. Tommy watches, wide-eyed, and Candace comes running. \nCatch is rising, a little sore and soiled.        The biker is angry. \nBIKER Goddammit -- I saw the kid. Jesus. I wasn't even close. \nBut Catch is walking     away with that frozen, numb look, all shut down by his     fear and his memory as Bob trots along beside him and     the Biker comes after him and Tommy and Candace watch him     go and Sharon hurries her steps to catch up. The Biker      reaches Catch first. \nBIKER Wait a minute!     Hey! \nBut Catch won't turn to him, walking on -- and the man gets in front of him, raging. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBIKER Why the hell did you cause a wreck?! I told you -- I saw the kid, you idiot. I was... \nPain and darkness build in Catch's eyes until he says in a quiet, choked voice, right into the Biker's face... \nCATCH One more word, and your life will change forever. \nThe man stops talking, looking at the dead certainty in Catch's eyes. He wants to say more, to save face, but Catch's look holds him like a fist. Sharon has stopped, frozen, watching. The Biker turns away and walks back to his downed bike as Catch moves on. Sharon can hardly believe all of this, following Catch again. \nON CATCH, SHARON \nSHARON Catch!   Catch! \nIt takes a moment for her voice to penetrate, then he quickly turns and sees her approaching. \nSHARON Are you all right? Your elbow's bleeding. I... \nBut he is tight, nearly frozen, everything held in. \nSHARON What's wrong? \nHe walks away from her, and this shakes her, and she catches up again. \nSHARON Where are you going? Catch -- you're scaring me. Please... \nBut he walks on, desperate, and she gets in his way, faces him. \nSHARON Please, Catch, don't... Can't you talk to me?! \nHe turns and walks off, heading for the street. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHARON Please.   Wait.     I... Catch! \nHe has walked into traffic -- not completely unmindful of the cars, but desperate to get away. She watches this, frozen, as HORNS BLARE. He has to stop in the middle of the street to wait a moment, and he stands there, stricken. \nON CATCH \nAs the traffic moves around him and the dog -- a HORN BLARES, BRAKES SCREECH, and he thrown into a storm of... \nFLASHBACKS \nThat come sharper and faster than before, bits and pieces of memory outside any order: He is driving, Annie smiles at him, headlights blind him, Annie screams, the little boy in Annie's arms grins at him, BRAKES SCREAM, Annie says something to him, calmly, but he can't hear her, the headlights blind him again and BRAKES SCREAM again, and: \nBACK TO SCENE (PRESENT) \nCatch stands there shaken and shut down. \nON SHARON \nWatching him, shocked and frightened for him. She sees the traffic let up, and Catch crosses and walks toward home. She watches him go. \nEXT. BUSY STREET - DAY (LATER) \nAs Robby and Sharon's police unit moves along with traffic. In a moment they pull over and park beside an office building. It is the same building the man entered shouting, \"Catch!\" Sharon watches the building's entrance. After a while... \nROBBY Are you going to tell me why we're sitting outside this building again? \nSHARON Watching for somebody.       Tall guy. 40s. Grey-blond hair. \n(CONTINUED) \nPINDELLA I'm a psychiatrist. \nSHARON And Mr. Lambert... \nPINDELLA My relationship with Mr. Lambert is confidential. \nShe's dying inside -- but covering, lying, forcing her way into this. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHARON He's your patient. He's your patient we... know all this. This is police business. I'm officer Sharon Pogue -- L.A.P.D. \nPINDELLA Look... I want to help Mr. Lambert but I can't tell you anything that isn't public record. \nSHARON In general. In general.   He's your patient, and he... \nPINDELLA He's not my patient. He walked away from treatment. That was... nearly a year ago. \nSHARON Why did he walk away? \nPINDELLA I can't discuss that, but if you know how to reach him, I would appreciate being able to talk to him. \nSHARON (desperate) You can help by just   telling me what's in the public   record. It'll take me half a   day to do a search. Can you tell    me? Just... \nShe is unable to play this out as a \"cop,\" her emotions coming through. Pindella sees this. She sits on the edge of a chair and takes a breath, speaks more softly. \nSHARON Can you please tell me what's in the record? \nHe stares a moment, sympathetic -- and realizing... \nPINDELLA You were with him -- in the car. Your uniform threw me. Are you his friend? \nShe looks at him, nods. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHARON More. \nHe takes that in, leans back on the desk. \nPINDELLA I can tell you he was in an accident, hospitalized, referred to me as an outpatient... \nSHARON What accident? \nPINDELLA A bus... a city bus hit his vehicle. That was a couple of years ago. It was... an awful thing. His family was in the van. His wife and child. His wife's parents... \nSHARON A bus... and a van. Where?        On... the freeway? \nSomething is pulling at her memory. Her vision turns inward, and she stops breathing for a moment -- remembering. She was there. And here we get a... \nFLASHBACK - CARNAGE \nA glimpse of the carnage -- what she saw, first on the scene -- with Catch lying there. All the while Pindella is speaking. \nPINDELLA (V.O.) I think so. Yes. Near Santa Monica.  On the freeway. He was severely injured but... thrown clear.  The others were trapped in the van. \nBACK TO SHARON (PRESENT) \nstill in shock, looks at Pindella again. \nSHARON Survivors?   Only him?      I... don't remember. \nPINDELLA Remember? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHARON (quietly) Yes.   I was there. I was there. \nPindella stares, then... \nPINDELLA His wife's mother survived, but... she was paralyzed. \nShe takes a moment, absorbing this. \nPINDELLA Elanora Chu.   She's still in town, I believe. \nSHARON Does he... still see her? \nPINDELLA He used to. I don't know. (pause) I'm glad to see... he has someone else who cares about him. I know he's running from this. He left all his friends, his home, his whole life. \nSHARON He says... he doesn't remember the accident. \nPINDELLA He lost a lot of memory. I tried to help him with that. He resisted. Walked away. \nShe stares. \nSHARON I think he remembers me. \nVery subdued now, she asks... \nSHARON How does he live? \nPINDELLA He received a large settlement from the city, but he...barely touches it. He was a professional musician. \nHe begins to shut down, to grow cold and numb and not hear this. \nSHARON Is it because you were driving? \nHe turns away, closing his eyes. \nSHARON I read the reports, and it wasn't your fault. It wasn't. Is it because you survived and they didn't? \nShe puts her hand out for him again. \nSHARON Catch. Please. Hold on, and we'll go in there together... \nHe does not take her hand, so she takes his and walks a few steps toward that building. \nSHARON You can talk to them. You can say goodbye or I love you or whatever... \nHe pulls his hand away again, more violently, a layer of rage over his pain. \nCATCH This is wrong! It's wrong!   Why are you doing this?! \nSHARON To help you. \nCATCH I don't need your help! I don't need this. We don't need this -- we're fine... \nSHARON We're not. We're not fine, Catch. Nothing is fine -- no matter how much you pretend. \nIt is as if she's fighting for his life again -- and her own. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHARON You pretend that nothing happened. You walk all over the city helping people, but you're dying inside. \nCATCH I'm not dying! I'm not pretending! I don't remember! I don't remember any of it. So leave me alone! What good does it do? It's gone! And I'm all right this way! Why do you have to change it? I'm all right. \nShe points at the building across the street. \nSHARON Then walk in there. \nHe can't even look at the place. \nSHARON Walk in there, and I'll walk in with you. Walk in there and say it's real -- what happened is real. Your family died. \nCATCH Don't talk about that!    Don't! \nSHARON (breaking down) All right -- you talk about it! You tell me your family died and I say yes, I know, I'm sorry, and you say, I loved them... and I say, what an awful thing to lose a family... \nCATCH (unravelling) Damn you, Shar. Damn you -- why won't you stop?! \nSHARON So you can have a life! \nCATCH I have a life! We could have a life. We could get up and go to work and come home to each other and never, never talk about before. We don't need to do that! Why do we need to do that?! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHARON Because it happened! Because it's the truth! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry it happened, but... \nCATCH Nothing happened! If we say it, then that's the truth, that can be the truth. Say it. Nothing happened. Say it, Shar. \nSHARON Catch -- take my hand.    Please. \nCATCH Say it!    I'm asking you to say it. \nHer tears come, and she shakes her head. \nSHARON I can't. \nCATCH Why not? \nSHARON Because I want it too much. I want everything with you. I want all of you -- not just the part that isn't hiding and running away... \nCATCH Why are   you pushing so hard? Why does it   have to be your way? Why does it   have to be your truth? This is   who I am! This is the way I am! \nSHARON Not anymore. It doesn't have to be this way anymore because you're not alone -- because we're the family now. We can be the family... \nCATCH You like to push people, don't you? You just have to push and shove and make it right for you -- for you. You push everybody, Shar. You even pushed your family away, didn't you? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHe has stung her. The tears are in her throat.         She has to take a moment, but she pushes through to say quietly... \nSHARON I just... want to say... \nCATCH You already said it.   You said it all. \nSHARON When you're ready, I'll be there for you. I just want to say that. \nAnd she turns and walks away. He watches her go, angry, scared and sorry for what he said. He takes a few steps after her, wanting to call out and to stop her. We see him almost call to her. He is coming apart, watching her, needing her so much, but unable to call out. \nHe is shaky. He takes a glance at that building, then away. He stares after Sharon -- but she's out of sight now. He steels himself, then looks across the street again at that building. \nHe is desperately afraid. He stares at the building a long while. He begins to cross the street. He makes fists to keep from shaking. He walks to the entrance. \nEXT. BUILDING - DAY \nSHARON I'm sorry for... what happened.     I know about the accident. \nELANORA (hopeful) He told you?! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHARON No. I found out, and... I remembered. I was there. \nELANORA Oh.   Yes. \nSharon stares a moment, begins with some of her tough cover in place, over her emotions. \nSHARON I guess he comes here a lot -- to talk to you. \nELANORA He shops for me. Twice a week. \nSHARON Oh. And when he comes here -- he never mentions the past, never talks about the accident? \nELANORA No. \nSHARON And you... let him do that?    All this time? Why? \nELANORA It's what he needs. \nSHARON Walking all over the city like... \nELANORA Like an angel.     Yes. Sweet man. \nSHARON But... you let him get so lost. \nElanora is a bit defensive now. \nELANORA I let him find his own way through it. Why did you come here, Sharon? \nSHARON Because... I want to know how to help him. \nELANORA You are helping him. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHARON I don't think so. \nELANORA Why not? \nSHARON He... he was paying me back, I guess, for the accident, for helping him. That's why he felt... so close to me. But... \nELANORA Is that what you think? \nSHARON But now he probably hates me. I... \nELANORA What happened? \nSHARON I took him to the cemetery, and... \nELANORA The cemetery! \nElanora's look darkens and she begins to shake her head in worry. \nSHARON I thought it might help him... come back, you know? But he wouldn't even go in. He screamed at me. \nELANORA (upset) What made you take him there? \nSHARON For the truth... \nELANORA He knows the truth. \nSHARON But he won't even say it, or... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nELANORA That's his way. That's his way through all this. He made a wall -- around that whole day, that night -- other things, too. He keeps them behind the wall -- his little boy, my daughter. He can't help it. The cemetery?! Do you know how hard it is for me to go to the cemetery? Can you imagine? \nSharon is shaken by this, realizing, crumbling a bit as Mrs. Chu goes on. \nELANORA That's where it stares you in the face -- the loss. And it's too much sometimes. \nElanora takes a breath, acknowledging how upset she is. \nELANORA See? I'm still finding my way through it. And Catch -- it almost kills him to think about it or say it or drive a car or see the place where it happened or... go by the cemetery. \nSHARON I was trying to help him... come back to some kind of life. I... \nELANORA But he was coming back. Do you realize how much he changed in the past weeks? His apartment, his life, his music is coming back. He fell in love! He even got a job, Sharon -- for you. For the two of you. Isn't that coming back? Why do you have to rush? Everybody has to rush these days. \nSharon, battered by the truth of this, is totally exposed now, realizing, admitting. \nSHARON I was scared. I push so hard... when I'm scared. \nELANORA Scared of what? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHe fishes a piece of paper out of his pocket. His hand is shaking as he reads a number off the paper. \nCATCH It was minute number 17 million eight hundred ten thousand, two hundred... or so. \nHe puts the paper away. \nCATCH That's the one I lost. And... when I lost that minute, I guess I tried to lose it all, all the memories -- because they hurt. I tried, but... I couldn't do it. \nWe -- \nFLASHBACK - INT. VAN \nto that minute and, for once, we go in order and     play out each piece of it. We see Catch driving the van,      his wife ANNIE beside him. His son Chet is in back with      his grandparents, Elanora and her husband. The boy      is a bit whiny, pouty. \nWe INTERCUT the flashback WITH -- \nCATCH \nat the grave, struggling through this. \nCATCH Chet... you weren't feeling so good, remember? It was your birthday, and you ate too much. \nWe see   Annie and Catch both glance back toward Chet, and we get   present sound in this FLASHBACK scene as Catch and Annie   both say, \"What's the matter? Hm? Aww.\" And then Annie   looks out the window and turns to Catch and -- we CUT TO   Catch at the grave, his eyes filling. \nCATCH And, Annie, you said... you said... \nIn the FLASHBACK we see Annie turn to him again, and this time we hear her say, softly... \nANNIE Slow down in the rain, all right? \nWe GO TO Catch at the grave, fighting tears. \nCATCH And I don't know if I slowed down. I don't know. I hope I did, but... I didn't always listen. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. \nBack in the FLASHBACK, we see Annie reach around as Elanora hands Chet to her. Then we're BACK at the grave and INTERCUTTING so that we see Catch speaking through his tears and we also see this tender moment played out in the van. \nCATCH ... You put him on your lap, and he looked at me, and I made a face. Remember? I made you smile, Chet. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCATCH (CONT'D) And then we all smiled, and it was a great minute. It was. I'm really glad... I found that minute. No matter what. \nCatch stares at the grave, in tears, as the rest of that minute now plays out, punishing him. It lasts only about three seconds: a bus out of control, headlights suddenly glaring through the windshield, Catch turning the wheel, BRAKES SCREAMING, PEOPLE SCREAMING -- and then it's over. And Catch has been battered by the memory, and is weeping, but has not looked away. He is still staring at the name of his family, and he is able to say, in a broken voice... \nCATCH I won't forget... anymore.     I love you. \nHe steps forward and puts his hand on the plaque, rests it there. We STAY ON this, then in a moment, we... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. CHURCH - DAY \nThe renewal of vows is over, and Sharon is standing in the aisle, nervous and not sure what to do. Guests are up and milling about, many leaving the church. \"See you at the house.\" \"See you at the party.\" Etc. A PHOTOGRAPHER is setting a group shot at the front of the church. Mr. and Mrs. Pogue, Larry and Kathy and the little boy... \nPHOTOGRAPHER All right. The whole family in this one. Just... \nOut of the milling crowd comes Sharon, taking a breath and braving it, walking up there, speaking quietly. \nSHARON Where do you want me? \nThe Photographer turns to her, wondering. \nSHARON I'm the daughter. \nPHOTOGRAPHER Oh!   Oh, well, how about... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nWe see the family shift so that Larry and his family are on one side of the parents. Sharon follows the Photographer's gesture to stand at the other side, beside her Mother. Her Father has not looked at her. The photo is taken. Sharon now turns to her mom and dad. This is difficult, the strain is thick in the air. \nSHARON You both look so great. \nMOTHER (nervous) You, too. \nSHARON I just wanted to... \nThe Father speaks to her, his voice not hard, but flat, not warm either. No smile. \nFATHER You coming to the party? \nSHARON Sure. \nHe nods, then turns to greet well-wishers. Sharon is left alone by the drifting away of the family, but one old couple greets her, the older woman (Mrs. Vander) wearing her new blue dress, her HUSBAND beaming beside her. \nMRS. VANDER Sherry!    Look how nice you look. \nHUSBAND Big police officer now. \nSHARON Not so big. (to Mrs. Vander) Nice dress. \nSharon moves off toward a side exit, trying to catch up with Larry and his family. \nEXT. SIDE OF CHURCH - DAY \nAs Larry and his family exit -- and Sharon comes out of the church, calling ahead. \nSHARON What's up with you? \nLARRY JR. They won't let me watch T.V. \nSHARON Oh. Well... let's pretend this is T.V. It's a show about a party. \nThey look about the room. \nSHARON (as if it's a secret) That man... is really a super hero. \nLARRY JR. Is not. \nSHARON Is too. And so is she. Look. See? Red tights under her dress... Oh-oh, that man gave her a drink with something in it. \nLARRY JR. With what? \nSHARON With stuff to make her sleep. He's a bad guy. \nThe woman sips her drink, and the boy smiles, getting into it. \nLARRY She drank it. \nSHARON Watch. She'll fall down any minute. \nThe boy is suddenly swooped up, lifted away by his father. Larry puts the boy down near the door. \nLARRY Hey, sport, you should go play outside. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHe turns to Sharon. \nLARRY Stay away from my family. \nThen he turns to the crowd, smiling a smile without humor, speaking loudly. \nLARRY Hey, everybody, keep it down. Somebody might call the police. \nThere is some nervous laughter, people watching them now. Sharon is angry and embarrassed, keeping her voice low. \nSHARON What're you doing? \nLARRY (to crowd) Once the cops leave, we can really party. \nThe crowd around them is all staring now -- as he turns back to Sharon. \nLARRY Why don't you give everybody a break -- and go home? \nIn the hushed tension that follows, a GLASS falls and SHATTERS, and more people quiet down and stare. Sharon looks at her glaring brother, looks at her Mother nervously picking up the broken glass -- no support there. Angry and shaken, she turns to the door. \nShe walks to the door, opens    it, starts to leave, starts to close the door behind her,    and she stops, take takes a breath, battling hard against    the old patterns of hurt and anger. She looks at that     nearly-closed door. She pushes it open and walks back    in. \nWe see a surprised and angry look from Larry, a worried look from her Mother -- but Sharon is moving through the crowd, searching until she sees her Father. She heads toward him. He sees her and walks into the kitchen, avoiding her. She follows him. We see Larry and his Mother exchange an anxious look -- and then move toward the kitchen. \nINT. KITCHEN - DAY \nSharon enters, waits, others are leaving the kitchen, leaving her alone with her dad, but he starts to follow them. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHARON Don't walk away. Okay? \nHe acts as if he just noticed her. \nFATHER What? \nShe gestures toward his hearing aid. \nSHARON Is it working?     Do you need to check it? \nHe absently touches the device. \nFATHER It's fine. \nSHARON Dad... \nBut the kitchen door opens. We hear the party going on out there. Larry and Sharon's Mother enter, her Mother looking at her husband and back to her daughter, very frightened. Larry is raging in a near whisper. \nLARRY What the hell are you doing?! \nMOTHER Sharon, please. \nSHARON Please? Please what?! Will you stop protecting him? You were always protecting him! Don't talk to your father. Don't bother your father! \nShe turns to her dad. \nSHARON I'm going to bother you for one minute, Dad. Okay? Can you handle that? \nLarry advances on her. \nLARRY Just get the hell out... \nAnd she turns on him in a fury that halts him. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \n", "test1_input": "KATHY He's okay now. He's torn up about it. Don't make him mad. \nSharon moves closer. She reaches out, touches Kathy with a comforting touch as the woman turns her bruised face away. \nSHARON When Larry and I were growing up, our mother said that all the time. 'Don't make your father mad.' (pause) Has he hit Larry Jr. yet? \nKATHY He never would. \nSHARON Oh.   Just you, huh? \nLarry is in the doorway now, angry. \nLARRY What d'you think you're doing in my house, Shar? In my home. \nShe walks out of the room and he follows her. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - DAY \nShe turns on him. \nSHARON You see a pattern here, bro? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLARRY I lost my temper. Things got out of hand. It won't... \nSHARON People always say that: 'I've got a temper.' Like it's an excuse. \nLARRY I don't need a goddamn lecture. \nShe comes very close to him. \nSHARON You want to hit someone?       Next time your 'temper' flares      up, Lar, and you just have to hit      somebody, you go home and hit your      father. \nLARRY You blame everything on him. \nSHARON I'm blaming you, you fucking coward. \nHe grabs her shirt hard. \nLARRY You don't come in here... \nHe pushes her into the wall. \nLARRY You don't come in here and call me names. \nSHARON What do you call a man who uses his wife as a punching bag? (pause) Coward. \nHe swings a slap at her. She blocks it and punches him hard in the face, and he crashes down on the floor. Kathy comes running, calling out... \nKATHY Don't hurt her, Lar...! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nKathy sees that it's Larry on his ass. The little boy comes out of his room. There is a surprised moment. Then Kathy picks up the child and takes him back to his room. Larry is sitting up, shaken, his nose bleeding. Sharon goes close to him, rigid with fury. \nSHARON I know how it feels, 'cause I remember. I remember standing between you and Dad and taking the blows for you -- and for what?! You turned out to be just like him, you bastard. (pause) And so did I. \nAnd she leaves the house and SLAMS the DOOR. \nINT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nShe is just returning home after her shift, very tired, drained. She absently turns ON the TV, the STEREO. She notices a blinking light on her MESSAGE MACHINE and hits the button. \nLARRY (V.O.) I bet you feel real proud of yourself, Shar, knocking me down in front of my family. You know what I've got in my hand? I've got a Polaroid picture of my busted-up face, and I'm thinking of sending it to your department, to your lieutenant. I'm going to turn you in to the police, Shar, and see how you like it. \nThe message ends.     She stands there a moment. \nSHARON (quietly) Oh, God. Oh, shit. \nShe sits on the edge of a chair, worried, deep in her thoughts, hitting bottom -- the darkness engulfing her. In a moment, she looks at her desk, walks there, opens a drawer, pulls out that piece of tape with Catch's number on it -- but it is all stuck to itself. She hesitates, then starts to pick it apart when a KNOCK at the door makes her jump. She wonders, then, somehow, she knows. She walks to the door. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHARON It's you, right? \nShe unlocks   and opens the door, stares at Catch, very vulnerable,   on the very edge, her pain and fear over Larry just   under the surface. Catch holds a box of cookies as   an offering. \nSHARON Can you just shut up?    Just shut up and listen. \nCATCH I didn't say anything. \nSHARON I don't want to talk. I don't care if you have to play some game and pretend you're a... 'angel of mercy' or... whatever. I don't care, but I don't want to hear about it. All right? I don't want to hear anything. \nShe steps back, allowing him in, and closes the door and turns to him. \nSHARON It's a bad night. \nHe sees her pain and puts his arms around her, pushes through his fear and holds her -- and she lays her head on his chest. He embraces her fully, and the effect on him goes deep, to his core, where there is both pain and longing, but he holds on to her, even rocks her a bit. She sighs. In a moment... \nSHARON This is good... but I'm too tired to stand up anymore. \nHe walks her to the couch and has her sit, and then slowly, gently, he \"disarms\" her. He lifts her leg, takes the ankle holster and gun off, puts it on the table. He turns her, takes the cuffs off her belt from the middle of her back. He reaches into her pants pocket and removes the Mace. From her shirt pocket he takes her I.D. shield. He has her lie down on the couch now, their faces close, eyes locked. They linger... \n", "test1_true": "(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHe looks a little lost, but he nods, helpless. He comes toward her lips -- finally -- but just before they touch, she says, softly... \nSHARON Kiss me someplace I've never been kissed. \nHe's not sure what to do. He begins to look her over -- as if hunting, and she gets a soft smile. He starts slowly toward her ear -- but she shakes her head. Her shirt is out of her belt and her midriff bare, and he starts to move there, but checks her with a look. She shakes her head. He hunts. Her smile deepens a bit. He takes her hand and turns it over, going for the soft flesh on the underside of her forearm, and she closes her eyes. He kisses her there softly, and then again, and then he lavishes kisses from her wrist to the underside of her elbow as she sighs with pleasure and draws up her knees in a kind of sensual glow that is leading them to... No. He stops. She looks at him, a deep look, soft voice. \nSHARON Why do you stop? You always stop. \nShe has a glimpse of his mystery, the old sorrow, the deep pain. He hugs her drawn-up knees, closing his eyes a moment. Then he sits on the couch, puts a pillow on his lap and raises her slightly, lays her head on the pillow. He strokes her hair, her scalp as she closes her eyes and sighs, slowly moving toward sleep. Our TRUMPET MUSIC slides in here, lush and dreamy as we linger a while, and then -- \nSLOW DISSOLVE TO: \nINT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - MORNING \nJust after dawn. Catch has slept on the couch. He is beginning to awaken now as the first light strikes the windows. The dreamy TRUMPET FADES OUT. Catch's eyes clear, sleep replaced by thought, and he is suddenly shaken by -- \nFLASHBACK - CATCH'S POV \n-- a sliver of memory. But in this one, he is driving. We see his hands on the wheel. Then his POV looks to the side and we see an Asian-American woman seated beside him, attractive, about his age. Her name is Annie. She is saying something to him. We don't hear the words. When the FLASHBACK ENDS -- \nBACK TO SCENE (PRESENT) \nCatch sits up on the couch, jolted.   He gets another sudden -- \nFLASHBACK - HEADLIGHTS \nglaring through his windshield, blinding him. He gasps, sitting there on the couch, but it's all over. He stands, rattled, and he moves toward Sharon's bedroom. \nINT. BEDROOM - MORNING \nSharon is peacefully asleep. He stands over her with troubled eyes, but this slowly changes to a loving look. He bends close to her face. He feels her breath on him. He wants to lie down with her -- but he raises a hand and very gently brushes her cheek. She stirs. He does it again. She sighs a peaceful sigh, opens her eyes. He smiles at her. \nCATCH New day. \nEXT. BOULEVARD - DAY \nSharon is driving Catch home. They are now on a main boulevard of stores, office buildings. They stop at a light. Both are surprised by a voice calling out from the pedestrians crossing the street. \nPINDELLA (O.S.) Catch? \nThey look up to see a well-dressed man pausing in the middle of the crosswalk to face their car. He is in his forties, tall, with grey-blond hair. This is RICHARD PINDELLA. He has a small smile and wave for Catch. Sharon is curious, looking at Catch. Catch throws the man a dark look and then turns away, ignoring him, nervous, intense. \nPINDELLA Catch? \nCATCH (to Sharon) Drive, will you? \nPindella is moving toward the car, Sharon watching him, wondering. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCATCH Drive! \nThe light changes. Pindella hurries to the curb as the cars surge forward. Sharon drives slowly, checking the mirror to see Pindella stare after them -- then enter the office building on the corner. \nCATCH Will you get off this street? \nShe makes a turn, glancing at Catch. \nSHARON What?       You owe him money? \nBut his dark look persists, and he doesn't answer. Then... \nCATCH If you take a right and stop -- we can walk from here. I'd rather walk. \nHe is nervous, being in the car -- and glad to leave it when she pulls over. She watches this, wondering. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY \nSharon exits the car and locks it, staring at Catch. \nSHARON If you're in trouble... \nCATCH I'm not. \nSHARON If you're in trouble with him, maybe I can help. \nCATCH Forget about him. Somebody I used to know. I don't want to know him anymore. That's all. Forget about it. Walk with me. \nShe hesitates,    then falls in   beside him as he walks on. They walk along    in silence,   the neighborhood growing more seedy, tougher    as they go.    Catch is relaxing now, trying to push it all    away. Sharon    looks around her. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHARON This is not a great place to walk. \nCATCH I like it here. It's fine. \nSHARON I work here.   It's not fine. \nCATCH What's the problem? \nSHARON Besides the shootings, break-ins, rapes, cart thefts? We've got a loose dog raiding garbage cans, knocking 'em over. Can't catch him. Got somebody blowing a trumpet between midnight and three. Can't find him. \n", "test1_id": 1854, "test2_input": "As someone approaches them, Catch makes eye contact and smiles a small, friendly smile-in-passing. He gets a brief smile in return. He and Sharon amble on. He does it again. \nSHARON You know everybody here? \nHe nods to another YOUNG MAN he's never met... \nCATCH How's it goin'? \nYOUNG MAN Goin' uphill, man. \nCatch and Sharon smile. \nCATCH (to Sharon) You try it. \nSHARON Try what? \nCATCH Go ahead. We need this. Everybody. \nShe has misgivings. A young woman is bustling along. Sharon makes eye contact and presents a nervous smile and a nod -- but the woman looks at her sternly and bustles on. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHARON I feel like a jerk. I feel like a smiley face. \nCatch smiles, Sharon frowns, but when an OLD MAN passes, she gives a small smile. The Man lights up. \nOLD MAN Mornin'. \nCatch looks at her. She tries to shrug it off, but can't quite hide her pleasure. Now Catch is pausing as a woman is walking her six-year-old daughter to their parked car. \nCatch makes eye contact with the girl and does a goofy wave that makes her smile. Sharon smiles, too. As the girl's MOTHER is unlocking the car, the girl shyly looks back at Catch for more fun. He does that quick finger trick -- trying to catch his own thumb, and the girl giggles But the Mother is impatient. \nMOM Go on. \nThe girl gets in. The Mother is about to close the door. She frowns, mean-eyed. \nMOM Move your arm! \nThe girl slides in further,         and the Mother slams the door. The girl follows her          mother with hurt eyes as she walks around to the driver's         side. Catch has paused to watch this, his eyes gentle         on the girl. The Mother is about to enter the car when         she sees Catch staring. \nMOM What are you staring at? \nCATCH She feels bad 'cause you yelled at her. \nMOM What?! Who the hell do you think you are? \nSharon is uncomfortable.       Catch persists, never flinching at the woman's anger. \nCATCH She just needs you to smile at her. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMOM It's none of your business! \nCATCH Why not smile at her?   What's it cost? \nMOM Who the hell are you to talk to me?! \nCatch's anger is like flint in his eyes.         It surprises Sharon. She's upset by this. \nCATCH You're so damn impatient. \nWOMAN Get away from me! \nCATCH You're so busy being pissed off, and time is going by. \nWOMAN What?! \nCATCH It's not her fault. \nThe Woman gets into the car and slams the door. \nWOMAN I'm calling the police! \nCATCH No.  I'm calling the police. (turns to Sharon) Hey -- police. \nThe Woman speeds her car away.       Sharon gets in Catch's face. \nSHARON Jesus Christ, Catch. \nCATCH Maybe she'll think about it now. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHARON You had no right to do that. God! You think you know everything?! Who the hell are you, some expert on raising kids?! The neighborhood angel?! Jesus! \nCATCH No. No, I just... some people are walking around blind... \nSHARON That's not your problem! \nCATCH Don't tell me what my problem is! \nSHARON Okay, fine -- you tell me what it is! \n", "test2_true": "SHARON Blind to what?! \nCATCH Blind to what's going on around you. Blind to what people need. We're supposed to take care of each other. We're supposed to keep each other safe. That's the way it should be -- if you're not going around blind, like that woman... \nSHARON Or like me, right? What about you? How come you can see? \nThat stops him, the darkness rising.    He looks about, trying to contain it. \nCATCH I think I'll... walk the rest of the way on my own. \nSHARON Yeah.    Fine. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCATCH I'll call you later -- about the hiking. \nSHARON I'll be out. \nShe turns and walks away.      He is still angry, but sorry to see her go. \nCATCH Shar... wait.    Hey! \nBut she   keeps walking, and he watches her walk away. Then he   walks on, upset, mad at himself, trying to pound through   it, walking quickly. He is passing an alley, when he   hears a CRASH. He looks in... \nEXT. ALLEY - DAY \nHe sees a large dog that has just knocked over a garbage can. He and the dog stare. Catch walks into the alley, approaches the big dog, squats down to look the animal in the eye, and begins petting it. The big mutt is now leaning into the petting, and Catch's eyes go deep -- and slowly find their way to a sad smile. \nEXT. CITY STREETS - DAY \nSharon and Robby    are patrolling in their unit. Robby is driving. Sharon     is watching out the window with a deep- eyed look, a bit    down because of her argument with Catch. She is staring as    she rolls along. \nSHARON'S POV \nShe is watching the people on the street, NOTICING, for once, just how isolated they are, each in a box, passing without connecting. \nON SHARON \nwatching. \nINT. CATCH'S APARTMENT - LATER THAT DAY \nWe've never seen the apartment flooded by sunlight like this, all blinds open. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nWe START in the kitchen, staring at the drawer that is now so loaded with toys, it won't shut. Some brightly- painted soldiers are sticking out of the drawer. \nIn the living room there are two chairs now, and more lamps and tables. Our PAN REVEALS that the dog from the alley is sitting in the living room, watching Catch -- whom we now see is hanging a picture on the wall -- a mountain scene. He holds the picture in one place, then moves it to another, wondering. His fight with Sharon still colors his mood, but he's working through it. \nCATCH Do we go for... symmetry? Or... more off-center. Japanese. \nHe glances at the dog as he moves the picture. \nCATCH Are you into this? Bob? \nThe dog watches him. \nEXT. LARRY'S HOUSE - EVENING \nIt is early evening of the same day, and Sharon is just off shift, out of uniform in her own car, parking on Larry's street and walking to the door. She knocks -- and takes a step back. Larry opens the door, already angry, his nose bandaged, eyes blackened a bit from the blow. \nLARRY I don't want you around here. \nSHARON Let's go talk in the yard. \nThey stare. She starts walking back into his darkening front yard, looking over her shoulder. She walks to a tree where the tire swing hangs, waits there. He goes back inside, but leaves the door open. In a moment he reappears, coming outside, closing the door behind him. \nON SHARON AND LARRY \nAs they meet by the tire swing.    His eyes burn her, hate and pain. \nSHARON You took a swing at me. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLARRY You asked for it -- calling me a coward. You knew I'd swing. You think I look bad now? Look at this. \nHe has a Polaroid photo in his hand, holds it in front of her, dried blood and bad bruising on his face. \nLARRY Nice, huh? Beautiful. The cops'll love this, right? Evidence. Don't you guys love evidence? \nHe puts it in his pocket, and they stare a moment more. \nLARRY You wanted me to swing. \nShe looks away.     She nods, speaks softly. \nSHARON I'm sorry I hit you so hard. \nLARRY But you're not sorry you hit me. \nSHARON Jesus, Larry, what about Kathy's face?! \n", "test2_id": 1855, "test3_input": "EXT. COFFEE HOUSE - DAY \nCatch is standing outside, looking in through the large window, searching. His eyes settle on a man, and he stares. The man, about his age, is having coffee and reading the paper. Catch is staring deeply, mustering his courage. He walks into the place. \nINT. COFFEE HOUSE - DAY \nCatch hesitates, then walks over and stands beside this man until he -- JACK MOLINA -- looks up. Jack beams with recognition and surprise. \nJACK Catch -- Jesus! \nCatch is held back, smiling a bit, but on thin ice here, dipping into his past. \nJACK How are you? Sit down. Been years. You been out of town? \nCATCH (sitting) I've been around. \nJack's smile clouds as memory kicks in. \nJACK Oh, man, I'm really sorry about what happened. I never got a chance to say... \nCatch, with a steady look, says... \nCATCH We don't need to go there. \nJack nods a moment. \nJACK Okay. All right. So... what d'you want, a coffee? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCATCH I want my old job back. (pause) What d'you think? \nJACK You been workin'? \nCATCH No, but I'm up to speed. \nJACK (thinks) Well, it's not good with Randal anymore. \nCATCH No? \nJACK No, he's out of it, but Danny Coley's got something going. Wanna go see 'im? \nCatch stares, nods. \nCATCH Finish your coffee. \nEXT. PARKING LOT - DAY (LATER SAME DAY) \nIn a seedy parking lot, tough part of town, Robby and Sharon are arresting two teenage girls. One of them is leaning on the car as Sharon searches her. Robby stands back with the other (cuffed) girl. Robby is staring at Sharon through this moment -- noting the difference in her, still very professional -- but softer. The girl is upset, near tears. Sharon is gentle in her search. \nSHARON I have to check these jacket pockets. What's your name -- Allison? \nThe girl nods, not trusting her voice. \nSHARON I need to unsnap this, Allison. I'm checking your waistband. You got to Whitney School? \nALLISON St. Mark's. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSharon is searching, Robby is noting all this, his eyes appreciating the difference. \nSHARON Lift your arms higher. Got a good basketball team at St. Mark's. You play basketball? \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT (LATER THAT NIGHT) \nSharon and Robby are still on the job, their unit rolling down a residential street of apartment buildings. A parked car is BLASTING MUSIC, and Robby halts beside it. Sharon starts making dancing moves to the MUSIC, sitting there beside Robby, and he stares at her as she grooves, kidding it. Then Robby HITS the HORN to get the driver's attention in the parked car. Robby makes a gesture to lower the volume, and the man SNAPS OFF his TAPE. Robby rolls on, glancing at Sharon. She wears a small smile, checking their beat. \nROBBY What's going on, Pogo?    You're not happy or anything? \nSHARON Well, it's a mix, Robby. Life is shit, but I'm dating this great dead guy. \nShe smiles at Robby's look. \nSHARON He says before I came along, he thought he was dead. Sounds better when he says it -- (stops abruptly) Listen. \nROBBY What? \nSHARON Shhh.   Sh! \nRobby stops the unit, rolling the windows down.     They hear the FARAWAY SOUND of... \nSHARON The trumpet player. \nRobby pulls over. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nROBBY This time we got his ass. \nThey exit the car and stand in the street, looking up, scanning the dark buildings -- but the sound is hard to track, a FAINT BALLAD on a skillful HORN. \nSHARON Wow. \n", "test3_true": "SHARON Look at that moon. \nThey stare at the full moon. In a moment, we hear the sound of ROARING CARS, their TIRES SCREECHING as they turn onto this street, one car speeding ahead to cut off the other and force it to stop. The two male drivers are screaming at each other. Robby shakes his head. \nROBBY Full moon, man. Hey! \nThey run toward the drivers who are exiting their cars to confront each other. One big guy carries a baseball bat. Robby heads off one DRIVER while Sharon intercepts the BAT-MAN. \nDRIVER This guy's crazy! \nBAT-MAN This asshole side-swiped me! \nSHARON Are you McGuire? \nBAT-MAN What?! \nSHARON Mark McGuire? \nBAT-MAN No. \nSHARON Then put that bat away.   Put it in your trunk. Now. \nThe man hesitates, then moves toward his trunk. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDRIVER I never touched his car. \nBAT-MAN You lying bastard! \nThe man charges, bat in hand, and Sharon makes a flying tackle, bringing him down hard on the street -- and we immediately... \nCUT TO: \nINT. SHARON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (LATER) \nas she lies on the bed, on her stomach, her top off, and Catch straddles her, massaging her back and shoulder which are sore from her tackle. \nSHARON Ow.     Ow! \nCATCH Sorry. \nSHARON No.     That's good. Deeper. \nCATCH (as he works) How heavy was this guy? \nSHARON Like a truck. \nCATCH God.     Tractor-trailer? \nSHARON Pickup.        Ow.   Ow! That's really good. \nShe begins to moan as he digs out the pain. He is fighting against the erotic charge of this, trying to keep it medicinal, but he's got his hands all over her naked back, and she is moaning -- so he stops and takes a breath. \nCATCH I better... More oil. \nHe reaches to the bed table and puts oil on his hands, noticing a card that stands open on the tabletop, a very pretty invitation. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCATCH This is pretty. \nSHARON Don't get oil on it. \nCATCH Renewal of vows -- that's great. Is this your parents? \nSHARON Yes. Just put it down.   I'm not going. \nCATCH Why not? \nShe doesn't answer. He puts it down, comes back to the slow rubbing of her shoulders, her neck. In a moment... \nSHARON If I go, my brother'll hurt    me with the department. I got     mad and knocked him down. All     they need is a complaint. Just     leave it alone and keep rubbing.     Okay? \nShe moans in pleasure as he rubs, trying to push all other thoughts away. \nCATCH So... he says you can't go? \nSHARON Can't you rub without talking? (then) It's been bad with my family a long time, so the hell with it anyway. If they don't want me there, I don't want to be there. All right? \nCATCH All right. (then, as he works) Bad how? \nSHARON Oh, Jesus! \nBut we see her eyes turn inward toward the old pain and, for once, she shares it. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHARON My father used to knock us around, all of us. But I'm the one who called the cops -- finally. (pause) They say I turned against the family. \nCatch works in silence a while, absorbing this, looking at Sharon with more tenderness than ever. In a moment... \nCATCH But... they invited you. \n", "test3_id": 1856}

{"test1_input": "FRANKLIN (covering his discomfort) Beautiful country. \nELEANOR How long have you been manager of the Inn? \nTOM Not long. \nThey BANG over a large pothole. They all fly up and land hard. \nFRANKLIN Got any paved roads? \nTOM No we don't. \nEXT. THE MERIWETHER INN - DAY Tom's car turns into a driveway. Franklin has a brochure for \"The Meriwether Inn\" opened in his lap. He tries to spy the building through the trees but cannot. \nHe looks back at the brochure. The picture is of a lavish Victorian Hotel and the words, \"Our renowned mineral hot springs can cure whatever ails you!\" \nFranklin looks up and sees a three-story hideous green and yellow monstrosity leaning slightly to one side. Paint is peeling everywhere. What once were flower beds are overgrown with weeds. \nThe car pulls to a stop. \nTOM You'll have a great deal of privacy. There are only a few guests right now as it's the off- season... I'm hoping to make some improvements by next Spring -- \nFranklin puts out his arm preventing Tom from getting out of the car. \nF \nFRANKLIN (panicked) I... I can't stay here. This place is a wreck. E LEANOR Franklin! \nTOM Look on the bright side. Most of your time will be spent in the water. (a beat) It's true, we've fallen on some hard times... \nRANKLIN Hard times? This is a disaster! It should be condemned! \nTom's southern manners are being put to the test, but he stays remarkably calm. \nTOM Yes, we've seen better days. (a beat) But then I imagine so have you. \nFranklin blinks incomprehensibly at Tom and what he has just said. \nTOM I'm happy to drive you back to the train station right now, if that's what you want. \nThey lock eyes. Franklin wonders if Tom's bluffing, but he can't tell. \nFRANKLIN (in a low voice) Fire. I'm frightened of fire. I can't get out if I'm upstairs. \nTOM We've got options. \nEXT. MERIWETHER INN GROUNDS - DAY Tom's car is now parked in front of a group of small cottages. Roy and Pete's horse drawn wagon is behind it. \nEXT. COTTAGE - DAY Tom and Pete open a set of shutters over the windows of a tiny cottage. \nFranklin and Eleanor sit in the car, watching. \nINT. COTTAGE - DAY Sheets cover the furniture, cobwebs span the beams and dust particles fill the air. \nAs Tom maneuvers the wheelchair through the front door, Franklin notices a broken window. \nFRANKLIN (caustic) Well ventilated, at least. \nRoy enters with a suitcase. \nROY Where do you want this, Mr. Roosevelt? \nFRANKLIN The bedroom, Roy, thank you. \nHe looks after Roy as he exits. \nFRANKLIN Tom, this young man appears quite competent. Would you ask him if he'd like to stay on as my valet? \nTOM (politely) Why don't you ask him yourself? \nHe tips his hat and goes outside. \nEXT. DRIVEWAY - DAY Pete, alone, drives the wagon past the Inn and out onto the road. \nINT. COTTAGE - DAY Eleanor stands in the middle of the tiny living room stunned by the squalor. She speaks to Franklin who is changing in the other room. \nT \n", "test1_true": "FRANKLIN (O.S.) No doubt. \nELEANOR Tell me again, Franklin, why are we here? \nFranklin is wheeled out by Roy, now changed into a bathing suit. \nFRANKLIN For the waters. Are you coming? \nEXT. A DIRT PATH - DAY Roy wheels Franklin while Tom walks in front of them leading the way. \nOM Mrs. Roosevelt want to swim? \nFRANKLIN Mrs. Roosevelt doesn't know how. \nFranklin takes in the surroundings. Deserted horse stables in total ruin and tennis courts covered with underbrush mar the landscape. \nEXT. POOL - DAY \nAn immense, T-shaped pool rimmed in concrete. The bluish water is clear and sparkling and a delicate steam rises out of the warmth. A MOTHER, eyeing Franklin approaching in his wheelchair, comes to the edge of the pool and coaxes her CHILDREN out of the water. \nAUNT SALLY, an ancient, gaunt, African American woman, stands guard by the edge of the water. \nTOM Mr. Roosevelt, I'd like you to meet Aunt Sally. \nFRANKLIN Aunt Sally. \nAUNT SALLY Good day, sir. I have towels for you. \nRoy wheels Franklin as close to the rim of the pool as possible. Tom lends his assistance and both he and Roy HOIST Franklin out of the chair and place him at the edge, letting his feet dangle in the warm water. \nTwisting on his massive arms, Franklin lowers himself cautiously. \nTOM Now give it a minute. You'll see that the mineralization makes the water more buoyant. The crippled boy who swam here was actually able to walk in the water. \nFranklin's legs flop as his useless feet touch the shallow bottom. Crushed, all hope drains from his face. \nFRANKLIN I can't even stand. \nAUNT SALLY Well, not yet. \nEXT. CABIN - NIGHT Roy sleeps on a couch on the front porch. Crickets hum. \nINT. CABIN - CONTINUING Eleanor tosses and turns on a roll away bed. \nINT. CABIN BEDROOM - CONTINUING \nFranklin lies in bed staring up at the ceiling. \nINT. MERIWETHER INN - DINING ROOM - DAY A handful of guests are spread out in a huge dining room. Franklin and Eleanor sit together. He is eating heartily, but Eleanor merely moves her food around. \nELEANOR This is simply revolting. \nFRANKLIN It's not very good, but it is mysterious. (holding out his plate) What in the world do you think they've poured over this chicken? Or is it possum? \nEleanor sizes Franklin up. She knows this is a preamble. \nH \nELEANOR You want to stay. \nFRANKLIN Yes. \nELEANOR New York has the best doctors and hospitals in the country. F RANKLIN I need something new. \nELEANOR This isn't about getting better is it? You don't want to come home. You don't want to live with us. \nFRANKLIN I refuse to be a burden to anyone. \nELEANOR You're not a burden, you're my husband. \ne reaches out and takes her hand in his. \nFRANKLIN I want to offer you the freedom you once so generously offered me. (she pulls it away) All you've ever known is duty. To me and to a political career that unless I can walk no longer exists. You've been exemplary. Now I'm telling you you're free to go. \nELEANOR (her voice rising) No. (a beat) I don't want freedom. I want a marriage. I want a life with you. \n", "test1_id": 1647, "test2_input": "TOM I've seen the best doctors. When you were in New York they opened me up for the second time. Now I just want to die in the bed I was born. \nFranklin is struggling with this. \nTOM You're going to do great things. This place has an identity now -- a purpose. It has you. \nAny guard Franklin had is gone. He reaches out and takes Tom by the sleeve slipping his hand into Tom's gripping it tightly. \nTOM Take care of yourself, Roy. \nROY God be with you, Mr. Loyless. \nTom takes one last look at Franklin. \nFRANKLIN You never pitied me. Thank you for that. \nTOM On the contrary, I envy you. \nFRANKLIN I will miss you all the days of my life. \nTom gets into his car and looks at Franklin with a smile. \nTOM Good luck, Franklin. \nWith a wave he slowly lurches down the long driveway and turns onto the main road. Franklin watches the car until it is out of sight. \nINT. HYDE PARK, NEW YORK - LIBRARY - DAY Sara paces wildly, waving a letter at Eleanor and Louis. \nSARA He wants to use his entire trust fund to buy that... leper colony! \nELEANOR Franklin has invited Louis and me to see the work he's been doing. \nSARA (derisively) Work! Playing in a pool all day long? Squandering his birthright on a group of fawning strangers? I consider this your fault, Eleanor! \nELEANOR I beg your pardon, Mama? \nSARA You have indulged him and this is the result. \nELEANOR (challenging her) Indulged him? I have indulged him? \nSara looks away. \nELEANOR He's a grown man who makes his own decisions. \nSARA But he does not need to buy it. \nELEANOR If it's of any comfort to you, I agree. \nLOUIS I'm against it as well. It will consume too much of his time and energy. \nSARA Then it is settled. We tell him no. \nELEANOR No, it is not settled. We must hear him out. Louis and I must see for ourselves the work that he has been doing then we will all discuss this further. (a beat) A nd tell him no. \nThey all look at each other for a moment. For once they agree. \nSARA Perhaps I have underestimated you. \nELEANOR Perhaps you have. But that has been my fault, not yours. \nEXT. MERIWETHER INN - DAY Fred, on crutches, swings himself up using one side and then the next under Helena's supervision. \nHELENA Excellent, Fred! Keep going... \nThey are surrounded by many others, Franklin, Eloise, Woodhall, Pat and Jake. \nThe BEEPING of a car horn gets their immediate attention. \nRoy leaps off the porch, skipping the stairs as his brother Pete drives up in Tom's car. He parks it and steps out. \nPETE Morning, Mr. Roosevelt. \nFRANKLIN Peter, what are you doing with Tom's car? \nPETE I was as sorry as anyone to hear about Mr. Loyless's passing. Wished he coulda' lived to see this! \nFRANKLIN What are you talking about? \n", "test2_true": "FRANKLIN Pete... I can't drive a car. \nPETE You can now. \nRoy opens the passenger door and lifts Franklin into the driver's seat. \nPETE Get on in and I'll teach ya'! \nHe begins showing off a system of pulleys and levers that have been attached to both pedals. They thread through holes in a second dashboard, attached to polished wood knobs. It's a hand-controlled automobile. \nPETE That one there is your brake. \nFRANKLIN Got it. \nPETE And this here's the gas. \nFRED Hot damn! You got hand controls. \nPAT That is a thing of beauty! \nFranklin begins running his hands over the polished wood knobs. \nPETE Now you got to push it real smooth or it goes all herky-jerky. \nFranklin excitedly turns the key and starts it up. \nPETE Wait, Mr. Roosevelt, you're not ready to drive yet! \nFRANKLIN Oh, yes I am! \nFranklin hits the gas as the car begins HALTING and JERKING the whole way down the driveway. Pete is yelling out instructions but Franklin ignores him. \nThey all watch as he pulls away. \nAs the car hits the end of the driveway Franklin reaches across Pete and opens his passenger door pushing him out. Franklin tears off alone -- out on his first solo spin. \nOVER MUSIC: \nEXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY 99    F                                                             99 ranklin is driving by himself with the top down, thrilled to be moving on his own. No one is pushing him. He's free. The car covers miles of farmland, passing pine forests, peach orchards and cotton fields. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. BULLOCHVILLE TRAIN STATION - MORNING A spent and anxious Eleanor, with Louis in tow, stands on the station platform, suitcase in hand. \nLOUIS It's a far cry from Grand Central Station. \nThey are both silent for a moment. \nELEANOR The wire said someone would be here to pick us up. \nThe sounds of tires screeching and a car horn cause them to turn around. \nIt is Franklin, sitting in the driver's seat of his car. \nFRANKLIN Your chariot awaits, Madame! \nLouis promptly drops the luggage. Then he and Eleanor walk over to the car, taking in the hand-controls. \nLOUIS When did you learn to drive this thing? \nFRANKLIN Tuesday! \nEXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY \nFranklin drives wild and fast. Louis hat flies right off his head. Eleanor just holds on. \nEXT. MERIWETHER INN - DAY Franklin, Eleanor and Louis pull up to the Inn. Though the brush has been cleared and the trees are newly trimmed, it's still a wreck. Franklin is too proud to concede Louis and Eleanor's disappointment. \nFRANKLIN Can't wait to give you the tour! \nEXT. GROUNDS - DAY Franklin wheels himself along the circular driveway, pointing things out, almost manic in his energy. \nFRANKLIN A small schoolhouse will go there. We need it badly as many of the children are barred from the local schools due to their infirmities. \nHe points to a dilapidated gardener's shed. \n", "test2_id": 1648, "test3_input": "Going over to Franklin's right side she puts a cane in his hand. \nHELENA (to Franklin) Now use your right shoulder and pull your left leg forward. \nHe does so. \nHELENA Good! Now with the muscles in your left shoulder, pull your right leg. \nFRANKLIN One small bump and I'll land right on my keister! \nHELENA That's what Elliot is for. He's going to hold you up. Hitch your leg! Come on! \nFranklin and Elliot attempt to walk. It requires immense strength and effort on both their parts. \nHELENA (ever the taskmaster) Elliot, don't lean in -- stand up straight. Pull against him. He needs you! \nAfter one or two steps the enormity of it overwhelms Franklin. \nFRANKLIN I can't. \nELLIOT I'm strong, pop. You can't hurt me. \nHELENA You can do this, Franklin! Keep going! \nThey start the walk again. It's awkward... difficult... but it's working. \nLOUIS (under his breath) I'll be damned. \nFranklin stops, exhausted. \nELEANOR Franklin, are you all right? \nFRANKLIN I'm fine. I'm just... \nRoy runs in with a chair and helps Franklin into it as Helena, Eleanor, Louis, Elliot and Roy all look at him, concerned. \nHELENA This isn't a replacement for the real work we're doing to get you on your feet again, understand? No one is throwing in the towel or even agreeing with that doctor's report... \nFRANKLIN I know, I know. \nHELENA I know it's not practical -- \nF \nH \nFRANKLIN No, it's not. (a beat) It's political. \nFranklin looks at Louis, then to Eleanor, and realizes that this could be it. EXT. GROUNDS - AFTERNOON Franklin and Elliot are walking. Helena is close behind, coaching. \nELENA Use Elliot, not the cane. Switch your weight to Elliot... good! Keep your head up. \nOff to the side Pat, Jake, Eloise, Woodhall and Daisy are having an informal picnic, observing Franklin. \nELOISE Why is he working so hard to hide it? \nJAKE He doesn't have a choice. \nELOISE Oh, I disagree. \nJAKE How can you disagree? \"There but for the grace of God goes us,\" that's what they're saying. As if our bodies is who we are, but it's not. It's our souls is who we are, but they don't know that. \nELOISE I wish he could just wheel himself out there in front of everybody. \nPAT He can't do that Eloise, it's politics. \nJAKE It's not gonna matter if he hides his legs as long as he don't hide what he knows. And what he knows is what it's like to be one of us. \nranklin, getting closer, raises his cane in greeting. \nFRANKLIN Good afternoon, everyone! \nOff-balance Franklin goes down hard bringing Elliot down with him. \nEleanor, Louis and Roy all rush to his aid, but Helena is there first. \nHELENA Take a moment to catch your breath... \n", "test3_true": "ELLIOT I'm fine, Pop. \nDAISY You fell down. \nFRANKLIN Yes, I did, Daisy. Twelfth time today. Must be a new record! \nDaisy laughs as do the others, though some can't hide their concern. \nFranklin struggles hard as Roy and Elliot help him to his feet. \nINT. COTTAGE - NIGHT \nEleanor is packing Franklin's suitcase while Franklin, sitting up in bed dressed in pajamas, works on his speech. \nFRANKLIN (reading aloud) And so America must find... reconsidering) No, America needs a pathfinder... \nLouis, pacing in shirtsleeves, nods approvingly. \nLOUIS That's good. \nFRANKLIN To emblaze the trail along a high road that will avoid... avoid the bottomless morass... \nDiscouraged, Franklin pushes aside the pages. \nLOUIS What is it? What's wrong? \nFRANKLIN What if I fall... trying to get to the podium. \nLOUIS If you fall, you show them how to get up. \nFRANKLIN No, if I fall in front of thousands of people I lose everything but their pity. (a beat) They'll be writing my obituary before I get up off the floor. \nLOUIS Elliot won't let you fall, he'll be there. All the arrangements have been made, boss. It'll be fine. \nFRANKLIN Who are we fooling? This will never work. They'll never let me back into politics. They'll never see past my legs. \nELEANOR My darling, they'll never see past your legs unless you do. \nEXT. MERIWETHER INN - MORNING \nFranklin is settling into the driver's seat of his car, aided by Roy. Eleanor is seated next to him; Louis and Elliot in back. \nFranklin's attention is diverted by something he sees straight ahead. \nIt is the entire Warm Springs group coming down the driveway in chairs and on crutches. \nAll the patients, the Push Boys, the physical therapists, Helena, Jake, Fred, Aunt Sally, Eloise and Lionel. \nFRED Don't worry, Doc -- we're not coming with you. \nF \nFRANKLIN Oh, you'll be with me. No question of that. (a beat) I am proud more than you will ever know to be part of this community. (his voice growing stronger) A community based not on birthright or privilege, but on compassion and courage. The true power of these waters is that they brought us all together. Our ability to help one another is what will make our victory over polio endure. Our ability to survive... despite the odds. F ranklin looks out at the sea of faces. \nFRANKLIN What we have done and will continue to do until this disease is defeated is come together -- like a family -- and do what we do best... (his voice breaking) Lift each other up. \nFranklin starts the car as the crowd begins to disperse. Then, spying Helena, Franklin calls out to her. \nFRANKLIN Miss Mahoney I need to speak with you, please. \nHELENA Sure, Doc. \nOff her smile, Franklin reaches into his pocket and withdraws a small box. \nFRANKLIN Thank you. \nHe hands it to Helena. She just stares at it, at a loss for words. \nRANKLIN Open it. \nShe does so, tentatively, revealing a ladies watch. \nHELENA It's beautiful. \nFRANKLIN Don't wear it in the pool. \n", "test3_id": 1649}

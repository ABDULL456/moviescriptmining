{"train": "WARM SPRINGS \nWritten by \nMargaret Nagle \nShooting Draft: 9.14.2004 \nFADE IN: \nEXT. A BODY OF WATER - LATE AFTERNOON A glimpse of sunlight desperately tries to force its way through a gray sky before being obliterated. A MAN, sunburned and bearded, lets himself fall from the edge of a boat and into the ocean. D UNDERWATER, through shafts of light, white limbs are FLAILING. The MAN struggles, alone. Bubbles stream upward. \nHe breaks the surface and gasps for air. \nHe begins to swim. His massive arms and shoulders grab at the tide in large, hard strokes. His legs and feet are buried beneath the dark ocean water. \nEXT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS \nA floating tenement. A crane LOWERS a fishing net into the water. The MAN swims into it. The net is RAISED as he lays, motionless, within its grip. \nEXT. BOAT DECK - CONTINUOUS                                   3 The crane swings around with the MAN in the net. \nHe is EMPTIED out onto the deck like a fish. \nAHIVERING on the rotting wooden planks he FLIPS himself over on his stomach. Slowly, using the palms of his hands, he DRAGS his trunk and withered limbs across the deck in a labored lobster-walk. \nHe uses his chest muscles to swing his legs around the edge of the boat. They dangle like pieces of rope, his feet white and flaccid. \nA towel, a bottle and a glass are wordlessly placed next to him by a CREW PERSON. He pours himself a generous amount of scotch and begins drinking. \nISSOLVE TO: \nINT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT                                      4 \nThe same MAN is illuminated by the light of a single candle. \nHe is dancing, holding on tightly to a WOMAN. \nThough the light is dim it is clear that he is clean shaven, with his hair neatly trimmed. \nTheir connection is powerful and alive. They stop dancing, overwhelmed with mutual desire. \nHe holds the WOMAN's face in his hands and KISSES it all over, moving into a realm of feeling that is foreign to him. \nHe kisses her passionately on the mouth. \nMAN Oh, my dear... \nHis fingers run softly over the outside of her breasts. She begins to undo the back of her dress and slips it down around her ankles. Wearing only her tight corset she brings his hands to the laces and together they undo it. \nWOMAN (whispering softly) It's all right, darling. It's all right. \nINT. HALLWAY - MORNING OSCAR, a manservant, is carrying both a silver tray and a pair of pants over his extended arm. \nA VOICE (O.S.) Oscar! Where the devil are you? \nDeftly, Oscar opens the door to a spacious bedroom. \nOSCAR My apologies, Mr. Roosevelt. \nINT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS There with his bare legs, muscular and lean, sporting black socks held up with garters is FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT, 39. \nHe projects a natural elegance and the confidence of a man who can have anything he wants. \nRight now... he wants his pants. \nFRANKLIN I've been standing here for five minutes. \nOscar offers the tray to Franklin which bear cuff links and a Tiffany watch which Franklin grabs. \nOSCAR Did you sleep well, sir? \nFRANKLIN Don't remember. That's good, isn't it? \nOSCAR Yes, sir. \nFranklin takes his pants from Oscar and steps into them, pulling the suspenders up and over his shoulders. \nFRANKLIN I better read it. Steel workers tend to vote democratic. Next. \nLOUIS Lunch with Secretary Daniels. \nFRANKLIN Must I? \nLOUIS He's your boss. \nFRANKLIN Anything else? \nLOUIS (a beat) What if she'd said yes? \nFRANKLIN Who? \nLouis shoots him a look that says \"you know who.\" \nLOUIS People know. It's time to stop. \nFRANKLIN I can handle my own affairs, Louis. \nLOUIS Not this one. This is Washington, D.C., not the Harvard Club. (off-put by Franklin's arrogance) How can you be so cavalier? \nFRANKLIN You say that like it's a bad thing. \nLouis takes a quick last drag on his cigarette and follows him inside a building. \nINT. FRONT HALL - NIGHT A large grandfather clock reads 3:00. \nThe sound of a key in the front door turns and Franklin quietly enters. His hair is a mess and his clothing is slightly askew. \nAs he comes through the hall two eyes shine in the darkness. They belong to Eleanor sitting rigidly on a settee, listening to the sound of Franklin's footsteps going up the stairs. \nINT. UPPER LANDING - CONTINUING \nFranklin goes into his bedroom. Eleanor quietly comes up the stairs and stops for a brief moment by Franklin's door, then goes off to her bedroom closing the door behind her. \nINT. FRANKLIN'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING Franklin lays sleeping in his bed as Eleanor enters quietly so as not to wake him. \nCarefully she picks up a set of keys on the dresser then turns and notices a packet of letters sitting on top of an open duffle bag. \nTentatively she reaches for them. She brings the packet, tied with a piece of ribbon, up to her nose. She is shocked by their familiar scent. \nWith trembling hands she unties the ribbon. Tears flood down her cheeks as she reads. \nFranklin opens his eyes. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HYDE PARK - DAY Springwood is the three-story Roosevelt mansion. It is surrounded by a thousand acres of forests, fields, bridal paths and a glorious view of the Hudson River. \nTHE FIVE ROOSEVELT CHILDREN are screaming on the front lawn playing a boisterous game of croquet. \nINT. SPRINGWOOD - DINING ROOM - DAY SARA ROOSEVELT, 65, sits at the head of the table. She is one for whom the expression \"Grande Dame\" was coined. \nFranklin is at the opposite end of the table, looking pale. Louis, as always, is by his side. \nEleanor, like a prisoner who has accepted her fate, sits across from them, calm and composed. \nELEANOR I have offered Franklin his freedom. \nFRANKLIN And I have accepted. \nSARA (to Eleanor) His freedom is not yours to offer! \nFRANKLIN I am in love with Miss Mercer, Mama. \nLOUIS Lord save us from fools in love. \nSARA Falling in love is out of the question. Why do you think men have mistresses? Duty. Duty to their families and their careers. \nEleanor rises from the table. \nSARA Where do you think you're going? \nELEANOR It's obvious that my input in this matter is of little importance. \nShe begins to exit the room, but Franklin is up like a shot. \nALICE Darling, you're a Roosevelt. What do you know about people? \nShe leans in conspiratorially. \nALICE Of course, I can think of one person you did manage to find the time to invest in. A Miss Mercer, I believe? \nFRANKLIN Alice, stop. \nALICE Don't misunderstand me, Franklin. Being married to Eleanor I think you deserved some fun. But you made the right decision. Especially since Miss Mercer has gone on with her life. \nFRANKLIN What are you talking about? \nALICE Edward Rutherford is a wonderful catch for a girl like her. \nFRANKLIN (stunned) She's married? \nALICE Last week. A small event, of course. \nFRANKLIN When I last heard she was governess to his children. \nALICE (with a smile) And then love bloomed. As a \"man of the people,\" I wouldn't be too hard on her, Franklin. We can't all have trust funds you know. \nEXT. STATEN ISLAND BOY SCOUT CAMP - DAY Franklin, Louis and a PHOTOGRAPHER disembark from a touring car. \nLOUIS We're not taking this defeat lying down, boss. We'll run you for Governor -- \nFRANKLIN (kidding) Really? Of which state? \nLouis shoots him a look. \nLOUIS Very funny. No, this buys you time. It buys you experience. \nFRANKLIN What about Al Smith? \nLOUIS He's vulnerable. You're still a fresh face, boss. We'll use that to our advantage. \nThey walk down a hill towards some waiting Boy Scouts as the PHOTOGRAPHER follows them. \nFRANKLIN Boy Scouts, Louis? Hardly my political base. \nLOUIS They've got parents. Besides they're photogenic. \nFranklin begins glad-handing the assembled group of mostly underprivileged children. \nFRANKLIN Franklin Roosevelt, happy to meet you. \nFranklin masks his thinly veiled discomfort with an artificial good cheer. Meanwhile, Louis, in full political mode, makes sure the L Photographer gets everything. \nOUIS Over here! \nFranklin poses with two Scouts. The picture is taken. \nSCOUTMASTER Okay, boys, lunch. Line up to wash! (to Franklin) Will you be joining us? \nFRANKLIN Of course! \nFranklin steps into a line before a large communal water barrel and glances sideways at GUISEPPE, 9, an immigrant child of the city streets. He wears his uniform proudly and smiles at Franklin. \nFRANKLIN What's your name, son? \nGUISEPPE Guiseppe. \nFranklin puts his arm around Guiseppe, forcing the moment between them. He waits patiently as the cameras click away. \nFRANKLIN Guiseppe! Come sta, ragazzo? \nGUISEPPE (puzzled) Okay, I guess. \nThe SCOUTS begin washing their hands together in the water barrel and Franklin joins in as Louis looks on admiringly. \nAs Guiseppe splashes some of the water on his face, Franklin, not to be outdone, does so as well. It's all for the cameras. \nESTABLISHING SHOT - CAMPOBELLO ISLAND \nEXT. ROOSEVELT SUMMER HOME - DAY A large but unpretentious house with a sweeping lawn that looks out over the icy waters of the Bay of Fundy. \nEXT. PORCH - LATE AFTERNOON \nELEANOR I thought it only struck children. \nOCTOR Not necessarily. \nLOUIS How did he get it? \nDOCTOR Some experts believe it is linked to contaminated water. But that theory is speculative at best. \nLOUIS It was the visit to that god damned Boy Scout Camp! \nDOCTOR In all honesty you need to be looking forward, not back. \nELEANOR What is the prognosis? \nDR. LOVETT The damage to his leg muscles is extensive. I suspect he will be paralyzed from the waist down. \nELEANOR Dear God. beat) And the children? \nDR. LOVETT If they don't have any symptoms by now then they have been spared. \nSara stands -- her bearing once again erect and proud. \nSARA Then we must count our blessings. \nR. LOVETT You will need to prepare yourselves. There is a deep depression that follows an illness of this magnitude. I'm afraid life as he knew it is over. \nTheir discussion is suddenly interrupted by the sound of a child crying. Eleanor rushes off the porch to the bushes. \nL \nEXT. BUSHES - CONTINUING Eleanor finds Elliot, having heard everything, curled up in a ball, weeping. She leans down and wraps her arms around him. \nINT. BEDROOM - WEEKS LATER CLOSE-UP - WALLPAPER \nA pink background covered in small white flowers with red centers and green leaves. There is a seam in the paper. A tiny white spot where glue has soaked through. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL - Franklin in bed. \nThis is all he stares at -- hour after hour after hour. \nHis lips are dry. \nA glass of water sits tantalizingly on the night stand. He reaches for it but it's a few inches out of his reach. \nSlowly, he begins to rock his torso back and forth. \nINT. HYDE PARK - PARLOR - CONTINUOUS Sara, Eleanor and Louis are in heated conversation. \nSARA Now that politics are out of the question he can stay here at home with me. \nELEANOR But what kind of life is that? \nOUIS I've rented him an office downtown. He can still practice law. S ARA Why would you want to do that? \nLOUIS Because he needs it. \nELEANOR He can pursue a career, Mama. \nSARA A man as proud and vital as Franklin... you're inviting him to be hurt. (MORE) \nAnd you, Mr. RA(cont'd) SA Howe, engaged in the fantasy of a political future for my son... is there nothing you won't do to keep your job? \nSara leaves as Eleanor goes after her. \nELEANOR Mama! That's not fair! \nINT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS Franklin, still rocking his torso, has now gained some momentum, managing to have moved just a few inches. \nINT. SUN ROOM - CONTINUOUS Sara busies herself arranging flowers. \nSARA What kind of life is it to be pitied and stared at? \nELEANOR What kind of life is it to be hidden away? I know you believe that what you are suggesting for Franklin is best. But I think you are making it harder for him. \nSARA I think I know what's best for Franklin. I am his mother! \nELEANOR And I am his wife. \nFRANKLIN Nothing. I fancy nothing. \nLOUIS He'll have the same. \nThe Waitress grabs their menus and scurries away. Louis opens his briefcase and hands Franklin a stack of mail. Franklin glances it, but doesn't open any. \nLOUIS There are a few from your children. \nFRANKLIN I can still read. \nFranklin flips through the mail and finds a letter that interests him, opening it. \nLOUIS Your wife wants you to come home. (choosing his words) She's concerned. I'm concerned. This life on a boat... where is it getting you? \nF \nFRANKLIN Getting me? For one thing, no one gets to see me and I don't get to see them. \nLOUIS Don't say that. Everyone's waiting for you to come home. The kids... they're aching to see you. \nRANKLIN (reading) Really? \nLouis looks sadly at his friend. \nLOUIS What's that? \nFRANKLIN skimming the letter) From George Foster Peabody. He owns a resort in rural Georgia for investment purposes. Hot springs or something. He claims that only recently a crippled boy swam in the waters and can walk again. \nLOUIS Oh, for Chrissake... \nFRANKLIN (reading) The high magnesium content of these natural springs will hold anyone up. Although it is not a resort for infirm types I am extending you my personal invitation to come visit in the off- season.\" (putting the letter aside) I'm only welcome in the \"off- season.\" \nEugene and Stanley approach the table. \nEUGENE Mr. Roosevelt, we got bad news. \nFRANKLIN What? \nF \nF \nSTANLEY It's the boat... it got banged up real bad tied to the dock. \nRANKLIN How bad? \nSTANLEY I don't think you can stay there anymore. \nranklin absorbs this. \nEUGENE Maybe it's a blessing in disguise, Mr. Roosevelt. I don't know about you, but I'm homesick. \nFRANKLIN And I'm sick of home. (to Louis) Where's the letter from Peabody? \nLOUIS You can't be serious? \nHe hands Franklin the letter who rereads it. \nFRANKLIN Why not miracle waters? I've drunk the oil of monkey glands, been zapped with electricity and hung upside down in harnesses. After all that, this sounds downright peaceful. \nLOUIS I can't quite picture you in the back woods of Georgia. \nFRANKLIN Where do you picture me, Louis? \nLOUIS 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. \nFRANKLIN President, Louis? I can't visit the bathroom without a team of associates to help pull my pants down. \nE \nF \nLOUIS Give it a little time. \nRANKLIN There's a reason they say a man runs for office. (a beat) I'm going to Georgia. \nCUT TO: \nFranklin won't let himself believe it. \nFRANKLIN I can't imagine what you think that life is going to be. \nThis takes the wind out of Eleanor. \nELEANOR Oh Franklin... it's not up to me to imagine, it's up to you. \nEleanor folds her napkin and gets up from the table. \nEXT. COTTAGE DRIVEWAY - DAY Pete helps Eleanor into his livery wagon. \nFranklin watches from the porch as Eleanor rides away. Her suitcase slides across the open wagon bed, as the wagon makes the tight turn from the driveway onto the main road. \nON ELEANOR \nLooking out -- straight ahead. \nON FRANKLIN \nAlone and scared as he watches the wagon fade from sight. \nINT. HYDE PARK - DAY \nEleanor is pouring tea for Louis, who is seated. \nELEANOR Thank you for stopping by, Mr. Howe. \nLOUIS I thought you might want to see a friendly face. (off the silence) So how's our boy doing? \nELEANOR Well, he's enjoying the waters very much. He... (suddenly overwhelmed) I think we've lost him. \nHer pent-up tears burst in a free-flow. Louis leads her to a nearby settee and hands her his handkerchief. E LEANOR Please excuse me, Mr. Howe. \nLOUIS Don't you think it's time you called me Louis? \nELEANOR Louis. \nE \nLOUIS Maybe we've been going about this all wrong. He's down there to be alone so let's give him what he wants. We change our focus. \nLEANOR To what? \nLouis smiles, knowingly. \nLOUIS To you. \nEXT. COTTAGES - SUNSET The row of abandoned cottages look strangely pretty, aglow in the setting sun. \nEXT. COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS \nFranklin is seated on the ramshackle porch in his chair. His cigarette hangs from his lip as he mixes martinis in a glass milk bottle. He pours one for Tom, then himself. \nFRANKLIN To your mineral pool, or whatever you call it. \nTOM Warm Springs. \nThey clink their glasses. Tom takes a polite sip, then chokes back the bad taste. \nFRANKLIN Too strong? \nTOM Haven't been in a drinking mood lately. \nFRANKLIN I have. \nTOM Actually, its the most god-awful martini I've ever tasted. \nFRANKLIN Are you always this direct, Tom? \nTOM Well, I never tasted a martini this bad before. \nFranklin takes another sip, checking. It tastes fine to him. \nFRANKLIN (hurt) Everyone likes my martinis... \nTOM So they say. \nHe hands the letter to Franklin who immediately begins reading. \nLIONEL (to Tom) Says she's gonna keep the Roosevelt name alive. Least till he starts walkin' and all. \nLionel takes the letter Franklin just handed him, opens it, flicks his flashlight back on and continues on his way. \nFRANKLIN (studying the letter) This is so unlike Eleanor. She's terrified of crowds. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HALLWAY - DAY \nLouis and Eleanor approach a set of double doors. \nELEANOR We are facing imminent disaster. \nLOUIS I take full responsibility if you hyperventilate or faint. \nThey enter the room. \nINT. MEETING ROOM - CONTINUOUS At a lectern, behind which a banner reads \"LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS,\" the CHAIRWOMAN sees them and waves them forward. \nCHAIRWOMAN Ah, here she is now. Ladies, Mrs. Franklin Roosevelt. \nA small crowd of about two dozen women offer up polite, but scant applause for Eleanor. \nELEANOR Good afternoon. I am so pleased to be invited here today. looking down at her cards) Too often.... \nA PHOTOGRAPHER snaps a picture which throws Eleanor off. \nELEANOR Too often... \nShe stops. The pause is deadly. Louis looks ready to jump out a window. Eleanor continues, her voice still pitched too high. \nELEANOR Too often the great decisions are originated and given form in bodies made up wholly of men... \nSlowly, she begins to find her voice. \nELEANOR So that whatever political value women have to offer is shunted aside... without expression. T his is a mistake. \nShe looks up from her cards and stares at the audience... and for the first time speaks spontaneously. \nELEANOR I think this might be the reason I am having such a difficult time giving voice to my own thoughts here today. \nThe immediacy of her self-effacing comment charms the room. \nELEANOR I'm reminded of what someone once said about looking at an elephant. That it is impossible to ever see an entire elephant from one place -- you must walk around it. If our elected leaders are to be truly effective then they must be willing to go out of their way to look beyond what is right in front of them. To see the entire elephant. And for that... they need our help. \nThe ladies applaud her, much to her relief. Louis beams. \nLATER \nAt a reception following the speech, Eleanor and the Chairwoman are drinking tea. \nF \nCHAIRWOMAN That was so moving, Mrs. Roosevelt. The Child Welfare Amendment could use someone with your passion. You must consider being our spokesperson. \nEleanor looks to Louis who nods. \nELEANOR Oh. It would be an honor. \nCHAIRWOMAN Wonderful. \nEXT. POOL - DAY \nFranklin is attempting to walk in the water, working diligently. Tom watches him from a few paces back. \nTOM Morning. \nFRANKLIN I walked five steps today! \nTOM Congratulations. Listen, Franklin, I got word a local reporter wants to do a story on you. \nRANKLIN I'm hardly newsworthy these days. (a beat) How did he find out I'm here? \nTOM Small town -- word gets out. It probably won't amount to more than a provincial puff piece but it might give us some free publicity for the Inn. \nFRANKLIN That's marvelous, Babs. \nEleanor is flushed with pride. Franklin, catching her look, slips slightly on the bars as Roy grabs hold of him. \nROY I've got you, sir. \nFranklin then takes note that Eleanor's expression has turned to one of pure heartbreak. \nFRANKLIN You wonder why I want to go back to Georgia... it's to avoid people who look at me the way you just did. \nELEANOR You truly believe the waters... (with difficulty) ... that they are helping? \nFRANKLIN Don't talk to me as if I were a child. Choosing your words so carefully... \nELEANOR How am I supposed to talk to you? \nFRANKLIN Like I was! Talk to me like I was! \nRoy turns Franklin around on the bars and they begin walking away from Eleanor. \nELEANOR I don't know how anymore. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. COTTAGE - DAY Franklin is being lifted out of Pete's wagon by Roy and placed into his wheelchair. He sees Tom approaching. T OM You're a sight for sore eyes... \nFRANKLIN We missed you at the station... \nThe smile on Franklin's face slips to a look of shock as he takes in Tom's changed appearance. His face is sallow and his trademark white suit is hanging on him. \nFRANKLIN (concerned) Tom, are you all right? \nTOM It's just an ulcer. I can't eat anything I like anymore. \nRoy carries the luggage into the cottage. \nFRANKLIN (covering) My father had ulcers. Damn irritating. \nTOM Yes, they are. \nA silence hangs in the air. \nTOM Ready to swim? \nEXT. POOL - DAY Franklin now dressed in his bathing suit is being wheeled by Roy. Tom follows. \nTOM We've got some new guests. Some paying, some non-paying... \nAs they get closer, Franklin is stunned by what he sees -- \nA DOZEN PEOPLE -- all in different groupings -- some on crutches, others in wheelchairs, are gathered around the pool. \nFRANKLIN What in blazes?... \nTOM The interview you gave was syndicated in Sunday papers all over the country. \nFranklin looks up at Tom, dumbfounded. \nTOM They're here to see you. \nH \nThis news hits Franklin with the force of a sledgehammer. \nPAT DOYLE, 50, is stuffed into his wheelchair with a huge cigar between his fat lips. \nis eyebrows have a life of their own. He wheels himself to Franklin. \nPAT Mr. Roosevelt, Pat Doyle. I've come all the way from Minneapolis to shake your hand, sir. \nHe reaches out his hand to Franklin. \nPAT Stuck in this chair I do nothing but read. Newspapers, mostly. Usually I'm just looking for something -- anything -- that'll tell me there's even the slightest chance I'll walk again. \nFranklin is uncomfortable, especially as Pat won't let go of his hand. \nFRANKLIN I really don't know what to say. \nEXT. STATION PLATFORM - DAY \nRoy lays Fred on a bench. Franklin wheels himself over. \nFRANKLIN Son, can you hear me? \nTom brings a cup of water. Franklin puts it to Fred's lips. \nFRANKLIN Fred? \nFred opens his eyes. They are large and brown with a sweetness to them. His face comes alive when he recognizes Franklin. \nFRED Mr. Roosevelt?... \nFRANKLIN It's going to be all right, son. H e hands Franklin a worn newspaper clipping from his pocket. The headline reads: \"FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT SWIMS HIS WAY TO HEALTH!\" \nFRED The conductor wouldn't let me ride in the passenger car with my chair. \nFranklin looks at the clipping, then at Fred. \nFRANKLIN When did you last eat? \nFRED Knoxville. \nTOM Knoxville had to be three days ago. \nFRANKLIN Roy, take him to the car. \nAs Roy lifts Fred in his arms, Franklin wheels himself to the engine car. Tom follows as they approach the CONDUCTOR. \nFRANKLIN Who in their right mind let's a child ride in the baggage car! You could have killed that boy. \nCONDUCTOR He had polio. Probably still contagious. \nThe Conductor walks away, dismissively. Franklin pushes his chair up and stops the Conductor in his tracks. \nFRANKLIN Don't dismiss me because I sit in this chair! \nCONDUCTOR Get away from me. \nFranklin pushes the wheels of his chair with such force he knocks the Conductor over. \nFRANKLIN You ignorant son of a bitch. If I could, I'd get up right now and lock you in that box car! See how you like it! \nTOM Franklin... \nThe Conductor struggles to get up. \nCONDUCTOR Get this lunatic off me! \nFranklin wheels himself towards Tom's car where Fred is now lying across the back seat. The sight of Fred drains all anger from Franklin's face. \nFRANKLIN Where's the nearest hospital? \nTOM Atlanta. \nFRANKLIN What about a doctor? \nTOM Closer, but not by much. \nThe train whistle BLOWS. \nROY Train's ready. \nFranklin looks at Fred, then at Roy and Tom. \nFRANKLIN (quietly) Let's go home. \nINT. COTTAGE - NIGHT Fred lays in Franklin's bed while Franklin sits by the bedside. Roy lays a cold compress on Fred's forehead. F ranklin is using his watch to take Fred's pulse. \nRoy pulls back the sheet to give Fred air revealing his withered legs. Alabaster skin stretched over bones. \nFranklin looks away. \nINT. COTTAGE - DAY Franklin sits at a card table with his check book in front of him. Tom stands before him, shifting uncomfortably. \nFRANKLIN How many can pay? \nJAKE PERRINI, 32, Bronx-born with an upper body of steel wheels over to Roy who is fixing a wheelchair. \nJAKE Jake Perrini, Bronx, New York. \nROY Roy, sir. \nJAKE How you doin'? \nJake reaches out his hand to shake. Roy is unsure what to do. \nJAKE C'mon -- I won't bite. \nT \nROY (shaking his hand) Mighty fine, sir. Mighty fine. \nJAKE Hey, would you mind pulling me outta this trap, Roy? I wanna get airborne. \nRoy gently lifts Jake up and out of his chair, into his arms like a child. \nJAKE Do me one more favor? Throw me in? \nRoy tosses Jake to the heavens and he SAILS through the air emitting a jungle cry of pure emotional release before SPLASHING down hard in the water. H e bobs up to the surface. There is applause. \nFRANKLIN Now folks, these exercises are of my own devising so bear with me. \nSome laugh, some are confused. This is new territory for everyone. \nFRANKLIN My hope is that in repeating these movements over and over in the water I'm in some way causing the muscles to regenerate themselves and repair the damage. \nHe swims to the edge of the pool. \nFRANKLIN So everybody grab the edge of the pool and move what you can! \nhey disperse, eagerly ready to do what Franklin tells them. \nFRANKLIN Go ahead now, do your best! \nTheir legs barely rise up to splash the surface. Undeterred, Franklin leads them on, spiritedly. \nIn the distance we see Tom, leaning against a tree, watching everything. \nF \nINT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT Tom oversees the dinner service of paying guests -- none of whom have disabilities. \nINT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT Segregated in a back room, all the polio guests are gathered for dinner seated around a couple of sawhorses with old doors thrown across them serving as makeshift dining tables. \nRoy carries DAISY in and places her in the chair next to Franklin. \nRANKLIN Do you have a reservation? \nShe begins to giggle. It's infectious and soon everyone has a smile on their face, overriding the awkwardness of the situation. \nFRANKLIN Whether in here or our there, I guarantee you the food will taste the same... terrible. \nDAISY Shouldn't we pray first? \nFRANKLIN By all means. Would you do us the honor? \nFranklin bows his head for grace. \nDAISY Bless the food on our table. Keep us healthy, strong and able. Amen. \nALL Amen. \nEXT. FACTORY - DAY \nWith Louis in tow, Eleanor is touring the exterior of an ironworks factory. She is the only woman in a large gathering of men. \nELEANOR (V.O.) \"My dear Franklin, I too am embarking on an altogether remarkable experience.\" \nEXT. BUILDING - DAY leanor stands against a banner that reads \"CHILD WELFARE LEAGUE.\" She is passing out pamphlets to a small crowd that has gathered. \nELEANOR (V.O.) \"It seems everywhere I go there are more people in dire need of help. It would be overwhelming if not for my deep belief that help is possible...\" \nINT. NEW YORK STATE ASSEMBLY - DAY Eleanor is being introduced by Louis to members of the New York State Assembly -- all men -- eager to shake her hand. \nTOM I've seen the best doctors. When you were in New York they opened me up for the second time. Now I just want to die in the bed I was born. \nFranklin is struggling with this. \nTOM You're going to do great things. This place has an identity now -- a purpose. It has you. \nAny guard Franklin had is gone. He reaches out and takes Tom by the sleeve slipping his hand into Tom's gripping it tightly. \nTOM Take care of yourself, Roy. \nROY God be with you, Mr. Loyless. \nTom takes one last look at Franklin. \nFRANKLIN You never pitied me. Thank you for that. \nTOM On the contrary, I envy you. \nFRANKLIN I will miss you all the days of my life. \nTom gets into his car and looks at Franklin with a smile. \nTOM Good luck, Franklin. \nWith a wave he slowly lurches down the long driveway and turns onto the main road. Franklin watches the car until it is out of sight. \nINT. HYDE PARK, NEW YORK - LIBRARY - DAY Sara paces wildly, waving a letter at Eleanor and Louis. \nSARA He wants to use his entire trust fund to buy that... leper colony! \nELEANOR Franklin has invited Louis and me to see the work he's been doing. \nSARA (derisively) Work! Playing in a pool all day long? Squandering his birthright on a group of fawning strangers? I consider this your fault, Eleanor! \nELEANOR I beg your pardon, Mama? \nSARA You have indulged him and this is the result. \nELEANOR (challenging her) Indulged him? I have indulged him? \nSara looks away. \nELEANOR He's a grown man who makes his own decisions. \nSARA But he does not need to buy it. \nELEANOR If it's of any comfort to you, I agree. \nLOUIS I'm against it as well. It will consume too much of his time and energy. \nSARA Then it is settled. We tell him no. \nELEANOR No, it is not settled. We must hear him out. Louis and I must see for ourselves the work that he has been doing then we will all discuss this further. (a beat) A nd tell him no. \nThey all look at each other for a moment. For once they agree. \nSARA Perhaps I have underestimated you. \nELEANOR Perhaps you have. But that has been my fault, not yours. \nEXT. MERIWETHER INN - DAY Fred, on crutches, swings himself up using one side and then the next under Helena's supervision. \nHELENA Excellent, Fred! Keep going... \nThey are surrounded by many others, Franklin, Eloise, Woodhall, Pat and Jake. \nThe BEEPING of a car horn gets their immediate attention. \nRoy leaps off the porch, skipping the stairs as his brother Pete drives up in Tom's car. He parks it and steps out. \nPETE Morning, Mr. Roosevelt. \nFRANKLIN Peter, what are you doing with Tom's car? \nPETE I was as sorry as anyone to hear about Mr. Loyless's passing. Wished he coulda' lived to see this! \nFRANKLIN What are you talking about? \nFRANKLIN We also require a blacksmith's shop so we can craft braces here on the premises. I've found a wonderful local man who can make crutches and canes. His work is outstanding. Of course what is most desperately needed is a hospital. That's going to put my fund raising abilities to the test. \nFranklin wheels himself up a ramp to the Inn as Eleanor and Louis follow. \nINT. LOBBY - CONTINUOUS Surrounded by peeling wallpaper and threadbare furniture E Eleanor and Louis exchange glances. \nLEANOR What exactly are you proposing, Franklin? \nFRANKLIN That this will be the first polio rehabilitation and treatment center in the world. My personal trust almost covers the price of the Inn and the surrounding land. There will be a modest tuition charged to the patients which should hold us over while I seek out investors. \nLOUIS Franklin, you're risking everything you have... \nELEANOR And there are other costs to consider. \nFRANKLIN Mama will see that the children are provided for. \nELEANOR I'm not speaking of money. \nFRANKLIN I have found something here which makes waking up in the morning remotely bearable and the two of you stand there... \nELEANOR Franklin, I need for you to be practical and realistic. \nFRANKLIN (furious) Practical? I am trapped inside a body that no longer moves of my own volition. I am trying to be practical. Now either you're with me or against me. In or out! \nELEANOR I don't care for ultimatums disguised as debate. \nEleanor starts to leave. \nFRANKLIN Where are you going? Eleanor! Get back here. \nELEANOR I will see you gentlemen tonight. \nShe leaves. \nLOUIS You can't talk to her like that. \nFRANKLIN Oh really? Are you an expert on this now? How should I speak to my wife, Louis? \nLOUIS With the respect she deserves. (a beat) Look, I don't deny the work you're doing here could be important -- \nFRANKLIN Could be? \nLOUIS The issue is whether you want to run a rehabilitation center or whether you want to run for office again. \nFRANKLIN When I can walk, I'll run. \nEXT. POOL - DAY Eleanor approaches the pool. It is as quiet as a church. She is stunned to observe over a dozen tables set up in the water. \nOn each table is a child or an adult polio wearing their bathing suit. Next to them is a Physical Therapist also in bathing attire conducting therapy. In hushed tones the Physical Therapists encourage and work the distressed limbs of the patients as Helena swims to each table overseeing the work being done. \nEleanor sits down in a chair and watches fascinated. \nINT. DINING ROOM - EVENING The camera pans various tables revealing legs in braces, legs in wheelchairs, shapely legs, flaccid legs, children's legs... some reveal illicit romances, betrayed by secret hand holding and hands on thighs. \nJake and a new physical therapist, MARY BETH, are particularly cozy. \nFRANKLIN (O.S.) This is a very special night we're celebrating. At last we are together eating in this dining room! \nThe hands come up and out from under the table, applauding. \nON FRANKLIN \nHe is in his wheelchair dressed in a jacket and tie. \nFRANKLIN Now please join me in welcoming Miss Jackie Mills, a new arrival along with her father, Samuel, all the way from Oakland, California. \nCLOSE-UP ON JACKIE \nEight years old with black hair. Her legs are in braces and she grips her father's hand tightly. \nON FRANKLIN \nFRANKLIN Let us also take this opportunity to welcome our two able-bodied guests, Mr. Louis Howe and my better half, Mrs. Franklin Roosevelt. \nON ELEANOR AND LOUIS \nWaving politely from their seats. \nFRANKLIN Getting a doctor to live on the premises full-time. Someone who, at the very least, could monitor our progress. Make us legitimate. \nShe begins to take off Franklin's braces -- a series of intricate buckles. \nEleanor slides the braces off his legs. His legs, though now deeply tanned are withered and spindly. He is still wearing his shoes. \nELEANOR And that costs more money. \nFRANKLIN Yes. \nEleanor puts the heavy braces against the wall and kneels once again to untie his shoelaces. \nFRANKLIN But the real problem is no one is interested. The annual Orthopedics Convention is being held in Atlanta this weekend and I offered to speak. (his anger surfacing) They turned me down flat. \nEleanor takes Franklin's pajama bottoms off the bed and with tender care pulls them up his legs. \nELEANOR A few weeks ago, the conditions at a garment factory on West 27th Street were brought to my attention. The owners claimed everything was satisfactory, but would never let anyone in to conduct a proper inspection. \nShe reaches for Franklin's hands and pulls him up to a seated position. They are now face to face. \nELEANOR It took awhile, but we finally got in. \nFRANKLIN We? \nHe searches her face for clues as to the woman she's become. He starts to unbutton his shirt and put on his pajama top. \nEleanor sits in a chair across from him. \nELEANOR I showed up with someone from the Labor Board and we refused to leave until they let us in. \nFRANKLIN What are you suggesting? \nELEANOR At the risk of my good standing with the Junior Assistance League, I suggest we crash the party. \nShe stands and walks over to Franklin and runs her hand through his hair.    E LEANOR Good night, Franklin. \nShe goes to the door and opens it letting in a shaft of light against the candle-lit room. \nFRANKLIN Good night, Babs. \nShe blows the candle out and closes the door. \nE \nEXT. ATLANTA STREET - DAY Franklin's car pulls up to a massive stone building built in Greek revival style. Franklin looks intimidated -- there are two dozen stairs leading up to the main entrance. \nEXT. CONVENTION CENTER - CONTINUOUS Roy climbs the stairs like a stevedore with Franklin slung over his shoulder. Using enormous force, Eleanor is pulling the chair up and over each step while walking backwards up the stairs. \nINT. AMPHITHEATER - DAY The stage is lit with a skeleton hanging on a stand and large projections on a screen of spinal discs while a DOCTOR, in a dull litany, intones a prepared speech. \nDOCTOR A clinical situation where the radicular or nerve root is compressed by the prolapsed disc is referred to as a radiculopathy. \nDouble doors fly open with a BANG as all heads turn to see Franklin and Eleanor. \nELEANOR So sorry we're late! \nFRANKLIN Good afternoon! \nEleanor talks quickly while wheeling Franklin down the aisle. \nELEANOR (introducing herself) Eleanor Roosevelt, niece of the late President Theodore Roosevelt and this is my husband, Franklin, former Assistant Secretary of the Navy. \nFRANKLIN (sotto to Eleanor) Are you sure this worked on 27th Street? \nLEANOR (under her breath) It seemed to at the time. \nThey reach the befuddled Doctor on stage whose name tag reads, \"Dr. Bissell.\" \nELEANOR Thank you, Dr. Bissell for agreeing to let us share the stage with you today. It was so generous of you. \nDr. Bissell smiles limply, saving face. The audience vaguely applauds. Franklin and Eleanor are now center stage. \nELEANOR My husband, as many of you may have read, is a victim of polio. However, victim is only a definition, not a state of mind. Franklin? \nHe looks at her completely amazed. Eleanor gives him an F encouraging nod to take over. \nRANKLIN We all know that poor circulation is a chronic problem for limbs damaged by polio... I've never been able to swim more than a few minutes without becoming too cold. But there's a place, gentlemen... a miraculous place not three hours from here where the water is filled with natural minerals at a temperature of almost 90 degrees. That place, gentlemen, is called Warm Springs. \nFarmer and his Wife from the school house graduation approach Franklin. \nARMER Mr. Roosevelt you lookin' mighty fit. \nFARMER'S WIFE Fine day, isn't it. \nFRANKLIN It is. How's the Boll Weevil situation? \nFARMER'S WIFE I expect the Boll Weevil is always gonna be a situation, Mr. Roosevelt, but thanks for askin'. \nFranklin's energy and vitality are infectious. The politician within him is being reborn. \nINT. TRAIN CAR - DAY A beaming Eleanor sits down next to Louis. He too is looking very pleased. Eleanor takes notice. \nELEANOR Why do I get the feeling we're not smiling about the same thing? \nThe train begins pulling out. \nThey both look out at Franklin. Locals are coming up to his car surrounding him -- he is a magnet. \nLOUIS He's ready. \nINT. STATE ASSEMBLY, N.Y. - VIEWING SECTION - DAY Louis is seated in the front row of the balcony of the State Assembly, his feet up on the railing, eating pistachio nuts. \nAlso seated are two politicos, JAMES HASTINGS and STEPHEN TELLER. \nHASTINGS You can't kiss babies from a wheelchair. It'll scare their mothers half to death. \nTELLER Al Smith's got a lock on the presidential nomination. \nLOUIS Correct me if I'm wrong, but don't you think even after all these years that old Al's still a little rough around the edges? \nThey laugh knowing this is a huge understatement. \nLOUIS Franklin can help soften his image. \nHASTINGS How? \nLOUIS Let him put Smith's name in nomination. \nTeller and Hastings are none to sure. \nTELLER Well, he is a helluva speech maker. \nHASTINGS Yeah, but is your man up to it? \nLOUIS It's in the bag, guys. Count on it. \nBluffing is one of Louis's strong suits and it looks like they're buying it. \nJust then, Louis notices a familiar face down on the floor. \nI \nS \nLOUIS Hey, Stansbury, give my best to the Misses! (to Hastings and Teller) He's lost weight. Must've been the prison food. INT. MERIWETHER INN - HALLWAY - MORNING A line stretches outside with patients waiting to be seen. Among them is Franklin, chatting with everyone else, expecting and receiving no priority attention. \nINT. MERIWETHER INN - DAY ROOM - MORNING Dr. Hebert is examining Daisy. Helena is by his side, filling him in on her case history. \nINT. MERIWETHER INN - NIGHT Helena, dressed in a robe, walks the halls of the Inn. Something is amiss. \nEXT. GROUNDS - NIGHT An empty wheelchair, illuminated by a sliver of moonlight. \nOn a blanket nearby are Jake and Mary Beth. \nhe unbuttons his shirt and runs her hands over his impressively developed upper body. They begin to kiss hungrily, passionately -- completely in their own world. \nSeveral yards away, across the lawn, Eloise is in Woodhall's arms -- they are dancing. He is singing softly into her ear as they sway, her feet never touching the ground. \nNT. MERIWETHER INN - NIGHT \nHelena, in a nightgown, is looking out a window into the distance. Fiercely protective and slightly envious of her charges, she pulls a pack of cigarettes from her bathrobe pocket and steals a solitary smoke. \nEXT. COTTAGE - NIGHT Franklin seated alone on the porch in the darkness. He drags on his cigarette and the red glow illuminates the contours of his face in repose. \nFADE OUT: \nINT. MERIWETHER INN - FRONT DESK - DAY \nFred, wearing a bow tie and an oversized jacket, is proudly polishing off a desktop sign that reads: \"FRED BOTTS: DIRECTOR OF ADMISSIONS.\" \nHelena is behind him reading a file. \nLIONEL (entering) Here's another one he's refusin'. \nHe throws a telegram onto an already large stack. \nHELENA Why don't you read it? \nLIONEL Don't like telegrams. All them STOPS and stuff. \nHELENA Make you dizzy, Lionel. \nLIONEL A little bit. \nFred eyes the telegram, then impulsively grabs it, ripping it open. \nFRED \"Would be honored if you place my name in nomination for President. STOP. The party needs you. STOP. Yours sincerely, Al Smith.\" \nLIONEL Who's he? \nHELENA The Governor of New York. handing it to Lionel) Why don't you slide it under his door? \nLIONEL All right. Probably slide it right back. \nLionel leaves. Fred and Helena are silent for a moment. \nFRED He won't go. He doesn't want to be seen walking on crutches or being wheeled to the podium. \nHELENA The millions listening on radio won't be able to see that. \nFRED But all the people at the convention will. \nHelena nods, \"That's right.\" \nCUT TO: \nINT. COTTAGE - AFTERNOON Responding to a knock at the door, Roy gets up from sitting on the couch with Franklin, sullen and inattentive. H e opens the door to Louis who walks right in. \nROY Good afternoon, Mr. Howe. \nLOUIS Hello, Roy. \nRoy takes his hat and coat and exits to the bedroom. \nLOUIS I can't believe you've made me come all the way back to this hell hole! \nFRANKLIN I've done no such thing. \nF \nLOUIS I'm here to take you to Houston. You started your speech yet? \nFRANKLIN I'm not going. \nHe stares at Franklin, drinking. Shaking his head, he goes over to the sidebar and pours one for himself. \nLOUIS You know what this is, don't you? It's a golden opportunity. A springboard for you to run for Governor. \nranklin is silent. Frustrated, Louis takes a seat in Franklin's empty wheelchair. \nLOUIS Ever hear of a Civil War General named Francis Nicholls? \nFRANKLIN No. \nLOUIS Well, I never heard of him either. But this was one brave son-of-a- bitch. Fought for the Confederacy and lost his left arm in one battle and his left foot in another. Then after the war he ran and won the Governorship of Louisiana -- twice! \nFRANKLIN He was a war hero. \nLOUIS (with emphasis) Twice. (a beat) Look, I've worked like a dog to keep your name in play, grovelling at the feet of the powers-that-be in back rooms. \nFRANKLIN As much for you as for me. \nLOUIS I'll be damned if I'm going to let you pass up a chance like this. It's time -- and you're ready. \nGoing over to Franklin's right side she puts a cane in his hand. \nHELENA (to Franklin) Now use your right shoulder and pull your left leg forward. \nHe does so. \nHELENA Good! Now with the muscles in your left shoulder, pull your right leg. \nFRANKLIN One small bump and I'll land right on my keister! \nHELENA That's what Elliot is for. He's going to hold you up. Hitch your leg! Come on! \nFranklin and Elliot attempt to walk. It requires immense strength and effort on both their parts. \nHELENA (ever the taskmaster) Elliot, don't lean in -- stand up straight. Pull against him. He needs you! \nAfter one or two steps the enormity of it overwhelms Franklin. \nFRANKLIN I can't. \nELLIOT I'm strong, pop. You can't hurt me. \nHELENA You can do this, Franklin! Keep going! \nThey start the walk again. It's awkward... difficult... but it's working. \nLOUIS (under his breath) I'll be damned. \nFranklin stops, exhausted. \nELEANOR Franklin, are you all right? \nFRANKLIN I'm fine. I'm just... \nRoy runs in with a chair and helps Franklin into it as Helena, Eleanor, Louis, Elliot and Roy all look at him, concerned. \nHELENA This isn't a replacement for the real work we're doing to get you on your feet again, understand? No one is throwing in the towel or even agreeing with that doctor's report... \nFRANKLIN I know, I know. \nHELENA I know it's not practical -- \nF \nH \nFRANKLIN No, it's not. (a beat) It's political. \nFranklin looks at Louis, then to Eleanor, and realizes that this could be it. EXT. GROUNDS - AFTERNOON Franklin and Elliot are walking. Helena is close behind, coaching. \nELENA Use Elliot, not the cane. Switch your weight to Elliot... good! Keep your head up. \nOff to the side Pat, Jake, Eloise, Woodhall and Daisy are having an informal picnic, observing Franklin. \nELOISE Why is he working so hard to hide it? \nJAKE He doesn't have a choice. \nELOISE Oh, I disagree. \nJAKE How can you disagree? \"There but for the grace of God goes us,\" that's what they're saying. As if our bodies is who we are, but it's not. It's our souls is who we are, but they don't know that. \nELOISE I wish he could just wheel himself out there in front of everybody. \nPAT He can't do that Eloise, it's politics. \nJAKE It's not gonna matter if he hides his legs as long as he don't hide what he knows. And what he knows is what it's like to be one of us. \nranklin, getting closer, raises his cane in greeting. \nFRANKLIN Good afternoon, everyone! \nOff-balance Franklin goes down hard bringing Elliot down with him. \nEleanor, Louis and Roy all rush to his aid, but Helena is there first. \nHELENA Take a moment to catch your breath... \nHELENA I'll try not to. Good luck, Franklin. \nFRANKLIN I'm throwing myself to the wolves. \nHELENA You've faced worse. And if they bite, you can come back here. \nFRANKLIN I'll always come back here. \nHelena steps away and Franklin pulls out and down the driveway. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOUSTON TRAIN STATION - NIGHT \nDark and deserted Roy is carrying Franklin down a flight of stairs. Louis is hastily checking over his shoulder. If possible, Eleanor appears even more nervous than Louis. \nFRANKLIN You're being superstitious, Louis. There aren't any reporters here. \nSuddenly out of the darkness a FLASHBULB POPS revealing a dozen or more REPORTERS staring incomprehensibly at the sight of a six foot, 200 lb. man being carried like a baby in the arms of a black man. \nNo one does or says a thing. The PHOTOGRAPHER who had the wherewithal to snap the one picture raises his camera to take another. \nBut DAN REED, a reporter for The New York Herald Tribune and a gentle giant at over six foot-four, reaches out and places a massive hand over the lens. \nSlowly, but firmly, he pulls the camera down. \nREED quietly) No. \nLouis and Eleanor stand stock still, tense, watching the scene unfold \nRoy is sweating; his arms growing weak. Elliot brings the chair around and Roy gently lowers Franklin into it. \nIt's a measure of Reed's standing with this group that his authority is unquestioned. \nBut the Photographer raises his camera again. Only now Reed isn't as kind. He grabs the camera from him and opens the back, pulling out the film and exposing it. \nPHOTOGRAPHER Hey! \nREED (tipping his hat) Good to see you, Mr. Roosevelt. \nFRANKLIN Thank you. \nINT. CONVENTION HALL - HOUSTON - NIGHT The enormous arena is empty but for some maintenance WORKERS and JANITORS. Louis enters and makes his way to the stage. \nHe approaches dead center and stands behind the podium looking out. GRIPPING the podium hard he ROCKS it back and forth. \nTaking no chances, he pulls a hammer out from the rear of his waistband and a bunch of nails from his coat pocket. \nLooking around to see if anyone is paying any attention to him he quickly ducks down behind the podium. \nThe sound of HAMMERING fills the hall as Louis, on his knees, NAILS the podium to the floor. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. CONVENTION HALL - DAY Twenty thousand CONVENTIONEERS are roasting in the hall. It is Houston in the summer and it's broiling hot. A sea of hand- held red, white and blue fans are being waved all at once -- most bearing the words \"SMITH FOR PRESIDENT.\" \nNear the stage is a long table where the new breed of RADIO REPORTERS are seated, each in front of a primitive looking microphone. \nA \nHovering in a group off to the side are Dan Reed and the REPORTERS from the previous night. \nINT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUING Franklin is standing ramrod straight holding onto Elliot's arm. He looks handsome in a navy pin-striped suit. As everyone else is sweating no one notices that Franklin is perspiring more than F most. \nRANKLIN Where is she seated? \nLouis, a human train wreck himself, reaches over to mop Franklin's brow with a handkerchief. \nLOUIS In a box stage left. Give me your hand. \nFranklin takes his hand off his cane. It's soaking wet. Louis wipes it, gently. \nFRANKLIN Louis, what the hell am I doing? \nLOUIS Putting your big toe in the water. \nJust then, a VOICE booms out from the loudspeakers: \n", "test1_input": "FRANKLIN (covering his discomfort) Beautiful country. \nELEANOR How long have you been manager of the Inn? \nTOM Not long. \nThey BANG over a large pothole. They all fly up and land hard. \nFRANKLIN Got any paved roads? \nTOM No we don't. \nEXT. THE MERIWETHER INN - DAY Tom's car turns into a driveway. Franklin has a brochure for \"The Meriwether Inn\" opened in his lap. He tries to spy the building through the trees but cannot. \nHe looks back at the brochure. The picture is of a lavish Victorian Hotel and the words, \"Our renowned mineral hot springs can cure whatever ails you!\" \nFranklin looks up and sees a three-story hideous green and yellow monstrosity leaning slightly to one side. Paint is peeling everywhere. What once were flower beds are overgrown with weeds. \nThe car pulls to a stop. \nTOM You'll have a great deal of privacy. There are only a few guests right now as it's the off- season... I'm hoping to make some improvements by next Spring -- \nFranklin puts out his arm preventing Tom from getting out of the car. \nF \nFRANKLIN (panicked) I... I can't stay here. This place is a wreck. E LEANOR Franklin! \nTOM Look on the bright side. Most of your time will be spent in the water. (a beat) It's true, we've fallen on some hard times... \nRANKLIN Hard times? This is a disaster! It should be condemned! \nTom's southern manners are being put to the test, but he stays remarkably calm. \nTOM Yes, we've seen better days. (a beat) But then I imagine so have you. \nFranklin blinks incomprehensibly at Tom and what he has just said. \nTOM I'm happy to drive you back to the train station right now, if that's what you want. \nThey lock eyes. Franklin wonders if Tom's bluffing, but he can't tell. \nFRANKLIN (in a low voice) Fire. I'm frightened of fire. I can't get out if I'm upstairs. \nTOM We've got options. \nEXT. MERIWETHER INN GROUNDS - DAY Tom's car is now parked in front of a group of small cottages. Roy and Pete's horse drawn wagon is behind it. \nEXT. COTTAGE - DAY Tom and Pete open a set of shutters over the windows of a tiny cottage. \nFranklin and Eleanor sit in the car, watching. \nINT. COTTAGE - DAY Sheets cover the furniture, cobwebs span the beams and dust particles fill the air. \nAs Tom maneuvers the wheelchair through the front door, Franklin notices a broken window. \nFRANKLIN (caustic) Well ventilated, at least. \nRoy enters with a suitcase. \nROY Where do you want this, Mr. Roosevelt? \nFRANKLIN The bedroom, Roy, thank you. \nHe looks after Roy as he exits. \nFRANKLIN Tom, this young man appears quite competent. Would you ask him if he'd like to stay on as my valet? \nTOM (politely) Why don't you ask him yourself? \nHe tips his hat and goes outside. \nEXT. DRIVEWAY - DAY Pete, alone, drives the wagon past the Inn and out onto the road. \nINT. COTTAGE - DAY Eleanor stands in the middle of the tiny living room stunned by the squalor. She speaks to Franklin who is changing in the other room. \nT \n", "test1_true": "FRANKLIN (O.S.) No doubt. \nELEANOR Tell me again, Franklin, why are we here? \nFranklin is wheeled out by Roy, now changed into a bathing suit. \nFRANKLIN For the waters. Are you coming? \nEXT. A DIRT PATH - DAY Roy wheels Franklin while Tom walks in front of them leading the way. \nOM Mrs. Roosevelt want to swim? \nFRANKLIN Mrs. Roosevelt doesn't know how. \nFranklin takes in the surroundings. Deserted horse stables in total ruin and tennis courts covered with underbrush mar the landscape. \nEXT. POOL - DAY \nAn immense, T-shaped pool rimmed in concrete. The bluish water is clear and sparkling and a delicate steam rises out of the warmth. A MOTHER, eyeing Franklin approaching in his wheelchair, comes to the edge of the pool and coaxes her CHILDREN out of the water. \nAUNT SALLY, an ancient, gaunt, African American woman, stands guard by the edge of the water. \nTOM Mr. Roosevelt, I'd like you to meet Aunt Sally. \nFRANKLIN Aunt Sally. \nAUNT SALLY Good day, sir. I have towels for you. \nRoy wheels Franklin as close to the rim of the pool as possible. Tom lends his assistance and both he and Roy HOIST Franklin out of the chair and place him at the edge, letting his feet dangle in the warm water. \nTwisting on his massive arms, Franklin lowers himself cautiously. \nTOM Now give it a minute. You'll see that the mineralization makes the water more buoyant. The crippled boy who swam here was actually able to walk in the water. \nFranklin's legs flop as his useless feet touch the shallow bottom. Crushed, all hope drains from his face. \nFRANKLIN I can't even stand. \nAUNT SALLY Well, not yet. \nEXT. CABIN - NIGHT Roy sleeps on a couch on the front porch. Crickets hum. \nINT. CABIN - CONTINUING Eleanor tosses and turns on a roll away bed. \nINT. CABIN BEDROOM - CONTINUING \nFranklin lies in bed staring up at the ceiling. \nINT. MERIWETHER INN - DINING ROOM - DAY A handful of guests are spread out in a huge dining room. Franklin and Eleanor sit together. He is eating heartily, but Eleanor merely moves her food around. \nELEANOR This is simply revolting. \nFRANKLIN It's not very good, but it is mysterious. (holding out his plate) What in the world do you think they've poured over this chicken? Or is it possum? \nEleanor sizes Franklin up. She knows this is a preamble. \nH \nELEANOR You want to stay. \nFRANKLIN Yes. \nELEANOR New York has the best doctors and hospitals in the country. F RANKLIN I need something new. \nELEANOR This isn't about getting better is it? You don't want to come home. You don't want to live with us. \nFRANKLIN I refuse to be a burden to anyone. \nELEANOR You're not a burden, you're my husband. \ne reaches out and takes her hand in his. \nFRANKLIN I want to offer you the freedom you once so generously offered me. (she pulls it away) All you've ever known is duty. To me and to a political career that unless I can walk no longer exists. You've been exemplary. Now I'm telling you you're free to go. \nELEANOR (her voice rising) No. (a beat) I don't want freedom. I want a marriage. I want a life with you. \n", "test1_id": 1647, "test2_input": "FRANKLIN Exactly. \nThere is a knock at the screen door. An earnest young man, BENJAMIN PRENDERGAST, 18, is peering in. He has a newspaper. \nPRENDERGAST Excuse me, are you Mr. Roosevelt? \nFRANKLIN Yes. Who are you? \nRoy opens the door to Prendergast, who enters. \nPRENDERGAST My name is Benjamin Prendergast. I've come to see if you could speak at this year's graduation ceremony at the schoolhouse. You being so famous and all. \nPrendergast unfolds the newspaper. There is a picture of Franklin under the heading \"FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT SWIMS HIS WAY TO HEALTH!\" \nFRANKLIN I'll be damned. \nPRENDERGAST Would you be available? \nFRANKLIN (looking up) When? Next spring? \nPRENDERGAST Next week. We only have a four month school year. \nFRANKLIN How is that possible? \nPRENDERGAST Tax dollars only cover that much. \nFRANKLIN Are you graduating? \nPRENDERGAST No, sir. I'm the principal. \nFRANKLIN I see. \nBut Franklin doesn't see. \nEXT. SCHOOLHOUSE - DAY A small breeze or a decent rain would knock it to the ground. \nINT. SCHOOLROOM - CONTINUOUS A bookshelf with four books. \nA few FARMERS and their WIVES sit with large groups of filthy children. They look at Franklin askance. \nPrendergast stands proudly beside three GRADUATES-TO-BE. \nTom stands in the back observing. \nFranklin, in his wheelchair, sits uncomfortably before the gathering. He notices a FATHER staring at his legs. \nPRENDERGAST Now that we're all here let me introduce to you to our guest speaker today, Mr. Franklin Roosevelt. \nFRANKLIN Good afternoon. \nA fly begins buzzing around his head. He laughs derisively, almost to himself. \nFRANKLIN At Groton, where I graduated from high school, our beloved Headmaster encouraged his students to enter public life... \nHe looks up and catches the glazed eyes of an undernourished child which unsettles him. \nFRANKLIN I chose to attend Harvard for my undergraduate work and then Columbia for my law degree. H e takes in their uncomprehending expressions. \nFRANKLIN I followed my Headmaster's advice and sought a career in public life. But circumstances beyond my control have made that... very difficult... \nR \nHe stares at his tiny audience, all of whom know something about circumstances beyond their control. \nFRANKLIN I've given many speeches in my life... I don't know why I'm having such a hard time making this one... \nHorrified and unable to speak, Franklin seems temporarily lost, but the tiny audience doesn't seem to notice. They just see Franklin. \nINT. TOM'S AUTOMOBILE - DAY \nFRANKLIN My God did you see how they were looking at me? \nTOM They welcomed your company, Franklin. \nFRANKLIN Don't patronize me. \nTom is losing his patience. \n", "test2_true": "They continue to drive in silence. \nEXT. POOL - DAY \nIt's a cold day and Franklin is swimming in the pool. \nRoy is wearing a sweater. Aunt Sally is there, too, wearing a patched up coat with a scarf around her neck. Tom is nearby raking leaves. \nAUNT SALLY Mr. Roosevelt, aren't you cold? \nOY Mr. Roosevelt, you're gonna catch the chill if you don't get out of the water. \nFranklin ignores them and dips under the water as Tom comes over. \nAUNT SALLY You got to tell him, Mr. Loyless. He won't listen to us. \nFranklin comes up from under. \nTOM Franklin, we need to talk... Normally we close up this time of year and the staff goes home for the holidays. \nFranklin looks at Tom, then at Roy and Aunt Sally, acknowledging. \nThe sound of a TRAIN WHISTLE is heard. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. HYDE PARK, NEW YORK- LIVING ROOM - DAY \nThe WHISTLE is coming from a MODEL TRAIN as it zooms around a track set up on a table in the Roosevelt living room. Elliot, now 15, is mesmerized. \nSara sits at a piano between FRANKLIN, JR., 9, and JOHN, 7. They are finishing a rousing rendition of \"Angels We Have Heard on High\" as an enormous Christmas tree gets decorated. \nJAMES, 18, is at the top of a ladder while his sister, ANNA, 19, decorates from the lowest rung. \nEleanor holds up a tiny porcelain ornament to Anna. \nELEANOR Grandmother Delano brought this from China. \nFranklin, working from his wheelchair is filling out the lower branches of the tree, his lap filled with ornaments. E LLIOT Have you ever been to China, Father? \nFRANKLIN No, Elliot. Just your grandmama. \nSARA I adored China. It smelled of ginger cookies. \nL \nFRANKLIN, JR. et's go in the backyard and dig our way there! \nSARA That sounds like an adventure. \nAnna looks over at her father, sadly and Franklin catches her eye. She quickly looks away. \nFrom behind his back, John, pulls out the Christmas star and places it on his father's knee. \nJOHN Put it on top. \nSilence descends over the room. No one dares to breathe. \nELEANOR Give it to James. He's the tallest. \nJOHN No. \nANNA John, give it to him! \nJOHN Papa always does it. \nFRANKLIN I can do it. \nFranklin tosses the star in an attempt to reach the top. It almost catches, but it falls to the floor. \nQuickly, aiding to avoid his father's embarrassment, James climbs back up and puts the star on top. Sara sensing the awkwardness of the moment begins to play and sing an overly cheery rendition of \"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing.\" \nINT. STUDY - LATER Roy is spotting Franklin as he pulls himself along a set of parallel bars. Eleanor observes as Franklin uses his arms to drag his legs behind him. \nELEANOR It was an extraordinary turnout this afternoon. Louis says there were over two hundred people in the audience. \n", "test2_id": 1648, "test3_input": "Franklin, with difficulty, tries to do so. \nFRANKLIN Give me the good news first. \nHELENA Your gluteus maximus is better than I hoped. It will serve you well. \nFRANKLIN Must be all that sitting. \nHELENA I'm serious. Your right leg has some movement along the thigh. That's good because we can use it to help extend your hip, flex your knee and rotate your tibia. \nFRANKLIN I'm supposed to walk on one side? \nHELENA The water may help build some strength I'm not able to see yet. But to do that you would need to swim in the water much of the day. Not the limited hours you have now. a beat) Why should this place cater to a few able-bodied folk when it could be opened year round with polios? \nEXT. MERIWETHER INN - DAY Tom is pushing Franklin in his wheelchair. \nFRANKLIN There's a need for a place like this, Tom. (MORE) \nAre you aware NKLIN(cont'd) FRA that in the last epidemic over 16,000 people got polio in the New York area alone? \nTOM Sounds like you've been reading up. \nFRANKLIN I wish there was more to read. Damn few things being written about any of this. To think of someone like Fred... locked away... his mind and heart so vibrant... \nTOM It's a waste. An awful waste. \nFranklin takes a beat -- the weight of this sinking in. \nFRANKLIN What's the acreage here? \nTOM Roughly twelve hundred or so. Why? \nFRANKLIN I want to buy it. I think it would make one hell of an investment. \nTOM Investment? \nFRANKLIN Twelve hundred acres? Enough for two resorts, don't you think? \nTOM It would take money. There's a lot of land, rebuilding the inn, adding ramps and so many people can't pay... \nFRANKLIN (undeterred) Do you think old Peabody will sell? \nTOM He'll sell. \nFRANKLIN How can you be so sure? \nTOM Have you taken a look at this place? \nINT. TOM'S OFFICE   - DAY Franklin sits in his chair at a desk. \nFRANKLIN (full of charm) Peabody you old reprobate! How are you? \nTom is pacing back and forth \nFRANKLIN You'll never guess why I'm calling. \nEXT. MERIWETHER INN - MAIN ENTRANCE - DAY Helena is training a group of YOUNG MEN how to lift and carry using a raven haired young woman, ELOISE HUTCHISON, 18, as the test model. She sits shyly in her wheelchair before them. \nHELENA Woodhall, this is Eloise. Lift her gently. \nWOODHALL BUSEY, 17, has bright red hair and a face full of freckles. Over six feet tall he has spent his life working in the fields.          W OODHALL Yes, ma'am. \nHe picks Eloise up effortlessly, then sets her back down. \nHELENA Very good! Watch her braces. \nWoodhall kneels before Eloise like Prince Charming, carefully straightening out her legs. \nWOODHALL You're light as a ... \nHe notices the long jagged scars along Eloise's wrists. Eloise, sensing his eyes, self-consciously pulls down her sleeves. He stares at her questioningly. \nELOISE (looking away) I was a dancer... \nTom and Franklin come out. Franklin gives a questioning look to Helena, pondering how these boys have suddenly appeared. \nT \n", "test3_true": "FRANKLIN Welcome Push Boys! Good day, Eloise. \nELOISE Hello, Mr. Roosevelt. \nTOM Want to tell them your good news? \nFranklin is smiling like the cat that ate the canary. \nFRANKLIN It's hardly a done deal, but for better or worse, you may be looking at the new owner of this God- forsaken place. \nINT. COTTAGE - EVENING A free wheeling game of poker. Heavy with cigarette and cigar smoke, Franklin, Tom, Fred, Jake and Pat are playing. \nPAT Polio's always going to be a losing financial proposition, but it doesn't mean you shouldn't buy the place. \nFRANKLIN I am buying it. Make no mistake about that. \nPAT Good for you, Doc. \nFRED If you don't mind my asking, how will people pay for the services you are going to offer here? Most people with polio have a hard enough time making ends meet as it is. \nOM (gently) The boy makes a good point, Franklin. \nFRANKLIN Not everything in this world has to be about profits. \nP \nTOM I'll see your twenty-five and raise you twenty-five. J AKE C'mon will ya! The night's still young. \nTOM It's twenty-five cents not twenty- five dollars. \nPAT Don't mind him, Tom. He's a cheap bastard. \nFred and Pat fold immediately as does Franklin. \nFRANKLIN Too rich for my blood. \nJAKE (to Tom) Fine! Here's your twenty-five! You better have something. \nThey eyeball each other. Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. \nTOM Take it. I was bluffing. \nGleefully, Jake slaps his hands together and rakes in the pot. \nAT (handing Franklin a fresh deck) Your deal, Doc. \nFRANKLIN Very well. Gentlemen, the game is Five Card Stud, sevens are wild. \nEveryone groans. \nFRANKLIN Sevens are wild and you can all go to Hell! \nEXT. MERIWETHER INN - GROUNDS - DAWN The sun is about to rise. Tom's car is parked in front of the Inn, pulled up very close to the main entrance. The trunk is open. \nTom, struggling with a suitcase, comes down the ramp. He deposits it in the trunk and then walks precariously back up the ramp, having difficulty navigating the incline. \nHe goes back into the house for one last bag. When he comes out, he's surprised by what he sees -- \nFRANKLIN (O.S.) Where do you think you're going? \nFranklin is being pushed by Roy in his wheelchair. They are both dressed in pajamas and bathrobes, though Franklin has a blanket around his shoulders to shield him from the morning chill. \nTom is caught. This is everything he wanted to avoid. \nTOM Going to Asheville to see my parents. \nFrom the sight of Tom's car stuffed with luggage, it is clear he is not coming back. \nFRANKLIN I can't do this without you... we're only just beginning. \nTOM You. (You're beginning, not me. a beat) I've got cancer, Franklin. It's spread everywhere. \nFranklin is stunned -- utterly thrown. \nFRANKLIN I... I'll take you to the best doctors. We'll go to Atlanta right now -- \n", "test3_id": 1649}

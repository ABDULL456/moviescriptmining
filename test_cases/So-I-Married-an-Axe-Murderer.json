{"test1_input": "Charlie and Harriet wait outside his parents' door. \nCHARLIE Well, this is it. \nHARRIET It'll be fine. \nThey enter the door. \nINT. CHARLIE'S PARENT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nWe again move along the hallway. We pass the Scottish wall, of fame, Scottie from \"Star Trek\", Sir Walter Scott, Sir Harry Lauder, Sheena Easton, Al Pacino, Billy Connolly, then the CAMERA BACKTRACKS to Pacino, where it HOLDS MOMENTARILY. \nCHARLIE Mom, Dad, we're here. \nMay comes up, wearing a fancy country and western outfit. \nMAY Ah, Charlie is this the wee Harriet. Ah, she's beautiful. \nHARRIET Thank you. \nMAY She's so sweet. I hope you keep her. (calling) Stuart, come out here. You tube. \nWhen he comes up, Stuart is wearing only a shirt with his boxer shorts. \nSTUART Ah, it's the wee Harriet. \nMAY Stuart, put your pants on. \nSTUART Hold your horses. (calling to William) Heed! Pants! \nWilliam comes around the corner with his pants. \nCHARLIE Dad, what's Al Pacino doing on the Scottish wall of fame? \nSTUART Oh, that's for Tony. So, Charlie tells me you're a butcher. Let's talk meat. \nCHARLIE Dad, no one wants to talk shop. Especially butcher shop. \nSTUART Come here. \nStuart gets him in a half-Nelson. \nCHARLIE Ah! Dad, dad I have a back zit, man it kills. \nCharlie struggles to free himself. Stuart turns to greet Harriet. As he reaches out his hand. \nTotally instinctively, Harriet grabs Stuart's hand and twists it behind his back. Charlie is startled, as his date has just gotten Stuart into a Half-Nelson. \nHARRIET (releasing his hand) I'm sorry. I just... You just surprised me. I'm sorry. \nSTUART I like this one Charlie. She's quite a filly. \nHARRIET I'm really embarrassed. \nSTUART Don't be embarrassed about having a good strong butcher's grip. Do you link your own sausage? \nMAY Oh, ignore him. Come have a look at some photos of Charlie when he was a wee'n. \nCHARLIE Oh Mom, don't start with the pictures. \nMAY Ah, Charlie, lighten up. You've got a pickle up your ass. \nCHARLIE (whispering to Harriet) I'm gonna use the bathroom. You be okay alone with them? \nHARRIET (kissing) Fine. Don't worry about it. Hurry. \nThey smile as he leaves the room. \nSTUART Make sure there's paper, Charlie. \nCharlie picks up the pace, scared of what he might hear next. \n", "test1_true": "CHARLIE (shutting her up) Ma, just show her the pictures. \nSTUART And light a match. \nMAY (to Harriet) He always leaves the seat up. He's gotta learn. \nINT. BATHROOM AT PARENTS' - NIGHT \nHe closes the door, and shakes his head. What can he do? Those are his parents. On the wall opposite the toilet is a well-used dart board with pictures of the Queen Mother and Colonel Sanders. Hooked to the magazine caddie is a small container of darts. \nINT. THE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nMay excitedly shows Harriet family photo albums. \nMAY This is Charlie with his Uncle Ecky. He's a policeman in Canada. And our cousins Ruth and Jack. He's just got a restraining order from his wife. She's a lovely girl. This is Billy. He's a member of parliament. He drinks. \nHARRIET What a nice family you have. \nCHARLIE IN THE BATHROOM \nHe doesn't seem in any hurry to leave either. He listens through the door to Harriet enthusiastically looking through old photos. \nCharlie glances down at a stack of National Enquirers on the magazine rack. He flips through a few. \nHe sees one of the absurd headlines: \"ALIEN UFO SEX DIET\" Charlie shakes his head. \nHARRIET (O.S.) (through door) Charlie was the cutest baby. \nSTUART (O.S.) (through door) You okay in there, Charlie? You didn't fall in, did you? \nCHARLIE (through door) Jesus... \nCharlie then looks down at another article in the Enquirer and reads: \n\"WHO'S NEXT FOR MRS. X - THE HONEYMOON KILLER?\" \nIt is the article about Mrs. X -- the axe-murderer who kills her husbands on their honeymoons and then marries again under a different identity. \nIN THE LIVING ROOM \nMay is quickly flipping through a photo album, pointing out pictures of relatives as she goes: \nHARRIET I can't believe the resemblance between you and Charlie, Mrs. MacKenzie. \nINT. CHARLIE IN THE BATHROOM \nWith Harriet speaking in the b.g., Charlie continues reading, now absorbed in the article about the 3 victims: \nHARRIET (O.S.) (through door) You have the same smile. It's so incredible. \n\"VICTIM #1 - THE GERMAN MARTIAL ARTS EXPERT FROM MIAMI\" \n\"VICTIM #2 - THE LOUNGE SINGER FROM ATLANTIC CITY\" \n\"VICTIM #3 - THE SAN FRANCISCO PLUMBER - RALPH ELLIOT\" \nINT. CHARLIE'S CAR - NIGHT - C.U. - HARRIET'S FACE \nSitting in the front seat of Charlie's car, smiling, content, a great meal, a great night out with Charlie and a nice evening with his parents. \nSlowly PAN across the front seat to Charlie. A nervous anxious \"what the hell am I getting myself into\" look on his face. \nCHARLIE So, that was some move you put on my Dad, there. Did you study Karate, or...? \nHARRIET No. Not officially. I dated a guy for a while who ran a studio. \nCHARLIE Oh, the martial arts expert. The north-south guy. Here in San Francisco? \nHARRIET Actually, Miami. \nHe looks straight ahead, trying to act unfazed. But, he's very phased -- his expression is covered in it. \n", "test1_id": 2838, "test2_input": "CHARLIE Was that before Atlantic City, or after? \nHARRIET Oh, that was years ago. Atlantic City was recent. I didn't care for Atlantic City. A town full of gamblers and lounge singers. \nHe keeps driving. \nINT. POLICE STATION - DAY \nCharlie walks through the precinct towards Tony's office, holding the National Enquirer in his hand. \nDESK SERGEANT Hey Charlie! \nCHARLIE Is Tony back there? \nThe Sergeant nods and Charlie heads back to the office. \nINT. POLICE STATION - DAY \nCAPTAIN O.K., Tony. Do you have the K673 form completed yet, that street vendor incident on Powell Street? \nTONY (really bummed) Yes, Captain. \nCAPTAIN Tony, do you mind my saying that you seem a little down? \nTONY Captain. It's about my work. About being a policeman. \nCAPTAIN Tony, if there's anything wrong, I'm here to listen. \nTONY I know. And that's what's irritating, you're too nice. \nCAPTAIN Too nice!? \nTONY Yes, You're my captain for gods sakes. You should be constantly on my case, like the captain on Starsky and Hutch. Once a week you should routinely haul my ass into your office, accuse me of being a maverick and complain to me that you're sick and tired of defending my screwball antics to the commissioner. \nCAPTAIN Well, as you may know, Tony. I don't report to a commissioner. I report to a committee, some of whom are appointed, some elected and the remainder co-opted on a bi-annual basis. A quorum -- \nTONY Police work should be all about running around, following up crazy hunches that turn out to be right, going out on a limb. \nCAPTAIN Well Tony, I've never seen it that way. For me police work is all about following procedure and remaining accountable to the general public. \nTONY (exasperated) Captain! When I joined the police force, I thought I was going to be Serpico and unfortunately I ended up being Toma. I would have settled for Beretta. \nCAPTAIN That's interesting Tony. I'm perturbed that you should be so disillusioned. \nCharlie enters. \nCHARLIE Hey, Tony, I gotta talk to you. \nCAPTAIN Oh, hello, Charlie. Look, I'm in the way here. You guys probably have something you want to talk about, and Tony, if you've still got stuff you want to sort out, please, you know where the suggestion box is. \nThe Captain exits. \nCHARLIE Nice guy. Hey, what's up? \nTONY I'm having doubts about being a cop again. It's not like how it is on cop shows. All I do is fill out papers and reports. \nCHARLIE Let me get this straight, your Captain hasn't threatened to have you up on charges so fast you won't know what hit you? \nTONY No! He's never once said to me that he was going to \"throw the book at me so hard it'll knock my ass from here till Tuesday.\" Anyways what's up? \nCharlie pulls out the National Enquirer (the one on MRS. X, the Honeymoon Killer). \nCHARLIE Have you heard of this case? Mrs. X? She murders her husbands on their honeymoons and then changes her identity and marries again. \nTONY I never heard of it. So what? \nCHARLIE Curious, that's all. I read about it, and... (after a pause) I think I'm dating Mrs. X. \nTONY (after a pause) Two words, Charlie. Get therapy. They have doctors that deal specifically with this illness. \nCHARLIE Everything's adding up, Tony. One of the victims was a martial arts expert. Last night at dinner, she put a martial arts move on my dad. \n", "test2_true": "CHARLIE If they also say Ralph in their sleep I think it'd be a good start. (showing him paper) Ralph Elliot. A plumber from San Francisco. Missing since his honeymoon. \nTONY You're just getting scared. Like the dream, you feel Harriet could be the one, so you start to suspect her of things, 'cause deep down you're scared that if she is the one, you'll marry, and marriage to you is death. \nCHARLIE Hey, don't analyze my dreams, okay? They're my dreams. Analyze your own dreams. (a beat) It's not a marrying thing, Tony. It's a murdering thing. (showing him paper) Harriet lived in Atlantic City, right? Well so did this guy, right around the same time she left town. \nTONY (reading article) \"Larry Leonard, a crooner who made a name for himself for being able to sing in six different languages the song \"Only You\". (putting paper down) Does she know the song \"Only You?\" \nCHARLIE I don't know. It hasn't come up yet. \nTONY Charlie, move past it. You're running your life by the National Enquirer. \nCHARLIE (defensively) What? It's the fifth highest circulating newspaper in the United States. (taking paper back) Mrs. X. Please. Look it up. \nCOMPUTER ROOM AT POLICE STATION - MINUTES LATER \nCharlie and Tony are in the back with KATHY, a stocky black woman in uniform, who works in the files department. \nKATHY There's no record of any deaths. All three of these guys were reported missing around the time of their honeymoon, but so were the wives. No pictures of any of the brides. For all we know they just picked up and moved away. \nCHARLIE And Ralph Elliot, too? \nTONY Charlie, you're talking about three guys over a seven year span. That's hardly news. No deaths. Elopement in this state, as of this day, is still not illegal. \nCHARLIE (re: the article) Yeah well murder is. And this article says that these men were murdered by the same woman. \nKATHY Mr. MacKenzie, we've found that, most National Enquirer articles are actually based on our own police reports. They take the facts and fabricate a story around them. \nTONY It's true, Charlie. You gotta realize that. I mean, personally, I would lie to you, but Kathy... has this crazy notion of always telling the truth. (patting his back) You feel better now? \nCHARLIE It guess so. It's just... if I had a photo of Harriet, I could show it to the relatives or friends of Mrs. X's victims to identify her. \nTONY Charlie, listen to me! There is no Mrs. X! Drop it! Okay? \nINT. HALLWAY - HARRIET'S APARTMENT - EVENING \nCharlie knocks on the door. Rose answers. \nROSE (thrilled) You're back. But Harriet's not here yet. \nCHARLIE Maybe I could wait. \nROSE Sure. That would be fine. \nShe then starts to slowly close the door. He props it open with his hand. \nCHARLIE Inside? I was hoping... \nROSE (letting him in) I'm glad you asked. I didn't want to be so forward. I mean, if you're waiting inside, then you feel obligated to entertain me and keep up the conversation just to be polite, and really your head might be totally elsewhere and then there's the chance that you would really want to talk and it's me who'd be busy, but in an attempt not to be rude, I sit there and listen to some story that you don't really want to tell and I don't really have time to hear. You know? \nCHARLIE I couldn't agree with you more. \nROSE I think about a lot of things. \nCHARLIE Look, if you have work to do, you go right ahead. (\"ah, here's an angle\") I mean, to tell you the truth, I'd love to see your work. \nROSE Okay! What would you like me to do? \nCHARLIE No, I don't want to see you work. I was talking about your work. Your photographs. That one that I saw was so, wonderful, and... \nROSE Harriet's far more talented than I am. \nCHARLIE Well, I'm sure it's so subjective anyway and... (out of patience) Rose, show me your photos. \nCLOSE ON PHOTOGRAPHS \nThere are two kinds. Beautiful travel pictures and very erotic black and white portraits of young men and women. All with a slight sadomasochistic quality. At the bottom of every photo is says: \"Seasons Greetings\". \nCHARLIE Hey, these are some interesting photos here. Very impressive. Nice shots of Sauselito and... some good bondage shots. A lot of people wouldn't think to mix the two subjects, but they're really a natural together. (new thought) Hey, you wouldn't happen to have any pictures of Harriet by chance, would you? \nROSE (re: her cards) Well, I don't think she'd wanna do this sort of... \n", "test2_id": 2839, "test3_input": "CHARLIE Of course. Sure... \nCharlie gives her hand away to Mr. Levenstein. He takes Mrs. Levenstein's hand and starts to dance towards the EXIT, when suddenly the ELECTRICITY GOES OUT. The MUSIC is out. The LIGHTS ARE OUT. \nIn the dimmest of lights provided from the cloud covered moon outside, Charlie runs across the dance floor, fighting for an exit to the outside. \nHe arrives in someone's arms on his way. \nCHARLIE I need your help! You have to help me! I've married a...! \nThe LIGHTS GO BACK ON and Charlie is in HARRIET'S ARMS again. Her face is near menacing now. She smiles a very disturbed grin. He doesn't know what to say. \nHARRIET (much too pleasant) Hello, Charlie. \nCharlie and her are squared off. Neither speak. Suddenly both of them are lifted into the air. They look down and see the waiters and busboys picking them up onto chairs, throwing them up in the air again and again. The MUSIC plays along loudly. \nHarriet watches Charlie very closely, as Charlie looks scared. Then, the people start to carry them out of the room and down the hallway. \nWAITER Let's take 'em to their room. \nCONCIERGE Yeah, I'm sure they've had enough of these crowds for one night. \nCHARLIE My dinner. I didn't finish my dinner yet. \nHARRIET Smile, Charlie. Act like you're having a good time. \nINT. OREGON AIRPORT - SAME/NIGHT \nTony is talking to an attractive young girl behind the airport Rent-A-Car booth. \nRENT-A-CAR GIRL I'm sorry, Sir. The roads are all closed. We can't rent any cars this evening. \nTONY You have to rent me something. I've gotta get up there. My friend's in danger... \nINT. CHARLIE & HARRIET'S ROOM - NIGHT \nThe other hotel guests threw them inside. The room is all made up, the sheets are pulled down, the firewood is cut, the AXE is in the wood. \nCONCIERGE Have a good night, you two. \nCHARLIE Come on in. Stay for a nightcap. \nBELLBOY No, you two wanna be alone. See you. \nCHARLIE (demanding) Stay for a nightcap! \nBELLBOY Sir, I really don't think I should \nCHARLIE (shouting) STAY FOR A NIGHTCAP! \nThe bellboy is frightened and runs away. \nCHARLIE (shouting down the hall after him) STAY FOR A NIGHTCAP! \nHarriet pulls Charlie back into the room, frightened that he's leaving. \nHARRIET Don't go, Charlie. \nEXT. AIRPORT - NIGHT \nTony runs out of the airport terminal where he sees a man in his forties who's just entered his four wheel drive jeep. \nTONY (flashing his badge) Excuse me, Sir, I'm with the San Francisco Police Department. I'm on official business and I'm afraid I have to commandeer your vehicle. \nMAN (unfazed) No. \nTONY What do you mean no?! \nMAN I happen to know for a fact that you don't have the power to commandeer my vehicle. \nTONY This is true. (pause) Please can I commandeer your vehicle? \n", "test3_true": "TONY To The Dry Creek Lodge. \nMAN I'll give you a lift. \nTONY Well, I don't want a lift, I really want to commandeer the vehicle. Please just let me commandeer the vehicle. \nMAN Why don't you just let me drive you there? Really, I don't mind, it's on my way. (pause) \nTONY You're not going to bend on the commandeering thing are you? \nMAN No. \nTONY Well, if we get stopped will you at least let me say that I commandeered the vehicle, but I let you drive? \nMAN I'm uncomfortable with that. \nTONY Please? \nMAN All right. \nINT. CHARLES AND HARRIET'S ROOM \nCharlie & Harriet are all alone. The voices trail off down the hallway until they disappear. Charlie and Harriet stare at each other. Harriet blocks the door. Charlie looks around the room. The Axe. The Corkscrew. The letter opener. The fountain pen. At this point, everything in the room looks like a potential weapon. Harriet takes the axe. \nHARRIET I heard you on the phone before, Charlie. There's something I've got to tell you. \nCHARLIE (frightened) Harriet, I... \nHARRIET I've been married before. \nCHARLIE I already know. \nHARRIET About my husbands? \nCHARLIE Yes. And I was meaning to have a word with you. We could get an annulment. \nHARRIET (screams) AAAhhhhhhh! \nSuddenly the power goes off again. They're both in the dark. A scuffle. Charlie has restrained Harriet, throws her in a walk-in closet and locks it. From behind the door, we hear Harriet WAILING. Which continues. \nCharlie picks up the axe, looks at it, relieved at his lucky escape. He rushes to the door to escape. He opens it and standing there is Rose. \nCHARLIE Aaaaah, Rose, I never thought I'd be so glad to see you. \nRose smiles. Charlie puts down the axe. The lights flicker back on. \nCHARLIE (going to the phone) Maybe the phones are working again by now. \nHe listens for a dial tone. Beside the phone he sees a note. He starts to read is: \nCHARLIE 'Dear, Harriet. I just can't handle the commitment. I'm leaving you.' Signed, 'Charlie.' \nAnd behind him Rose approaches with the axe raised. \nCHARLIE What the hell is this? I didn't write this? \nAnd at that moment he turns to find the AXE BEING FLUNG THROUGH THE AIR AT his head. He ducks just in time. \nCHARLIE What the fuck?! \nShe takes another swing and she hits the lamp off the desk and the room is in complete DARKNESS. \nROSE Charlie. Why did you marry Harriet? I warned you not to marry her, didn't I? I warned all of them. But none of them listened to me. They all went ahead and married her. She's the pretty one. Where's Harriet? What have you done with my sister, Harriet? \nCHARLIE Nothing, Rose. \nROSE If you've done something to my sister, Harriet, I swear to God I'll kill you. \nWe stay in Charlie's hip pocket as he tries to get away from what he can't see. He stays very silent. \nHARRIET (from the closet) Where are you, Charlie? What's going on? \n", "test3_id": 2840}

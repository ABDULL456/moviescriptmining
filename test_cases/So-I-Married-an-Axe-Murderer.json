{"train": "\"SO I MARRIED AN AXE MURDERER\" \nScreenplay by \nRobbie Fox \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nFADE IN: \nOPEN ON: \nMONTAGE OF VARIOUS SHOTS OF SAN FRANCISCO - DUSK \nOver this we hear a recording of Jack Kerouac's poem, San Francisco which is accompanied by a BE-BOP trio. Kerouac's poetry coincides with the various shots of San Francisco. We come to a sign for Jack Kerouac Street. We PAN OVER to \"THE CITY LIGHTS BOOKSTORE\" and continue along to the ALLEYWAY where there is a large high-contrast black and white sign depicting Jack Kerouac in his famous \"I'm looking into the distance, having a brilliant thought\" pose... \nCHARLIE MACKENZIE, in his late twenties, wearing a flannel shirt and torn jeans, walks INTO THE FRAME, right in front of the picture of Jack Kerouac and inadvertently strikes the exact same pose. We PULL BACK to reveal that Charlie has a bag of garbage in his right hand, which he deposits in the alleyway. We FOLLOW Charlie into... \nINT. CITY LIGHTS BOOKSTORE \nWe FOLLOW him through the store. By day he is the Assistant Manager, by night he is a poet. \nA MAN in his fifties, wearing a beret and a goatee is reading, Charles Bukowski's, Playing The Piano Like a Percussive Instrument, Until Your Fingers Begin To Bleed A Bit. \nCharlie takes his place behind the cash register and resumes writing in his handsome leather-bound poetry journal. \nCHARLIE (sotto) O' SCOTLAND YOUR SUCKLED TEET OF SHAME \nCUSTOMER approaches. \nCUSTOMER Do you have the book On The Road by Jack Kerouac? \nEvery day there is a steady stream of tourists who come in to get copies of On The Road. Charlie is use to this and without looking up he points to a huge, well marked display of thousands of copies of On The Road. Another TOURIST COUPLE approach. \nTOURIST Do you have a copy of On The Road by Jack Kerouac? \nAgain not looking up, Charlie just points. \nTOURIST Thanks. \nEXT. CITY LIGHTS BOOKSTORE - NIGHT \nCharlie puts the \"CLOSED\" sign on the door and proceeds to walk home. \nEXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREETS \nThe sights and the sounds of the city are accentuated by the BEBOP as he sees life, warts and all. As the streets become less populated, he can now hear the sounds of his own FOOTSTEPS and, a COUPLE BICKERING. The streets become even more deserted. The night is closing in on him. A cat darts out from an alleyway and startles him. He quickens his pace. RUMBLINGS make him cross the street to avoid the danger. Headlights of a slow moving car approach from the distance. Charlie, frightened, turns another corner onto: \nHIS STREET \nHe approaches a 3-story Victorian home, in which he has an apartment on the second floor, he notices a light on in his window. A CRASHING sound from within. \nCUT TO: \nHANDS \ntaking papers out of a desk drawer. \nCUT TO: \nCHARLIE \ncarefully opening the front door and then gingerly closing it. He reaches for a baseball bat in a nearby umbrella stand. Sound of BREAKING GLASS from his apartment upstairs. \nCUT BACK TO: \nSHATTERED PICTURE FRAME \nwith a photo of Charlie and an angelic blonde. \nCUT BACK TO: \nCHARLIE She smelled exactly like Campbell's Beef Vegetable soup. She was dirty, physically dirty. \nSHERRI Well, Charlie, I wonder what you're gonna say were my problems? Are you gonna tell your friends that I was a junkie, that I wasn't supportive enough or that I smelled like relish? Charlie, I loved you. It could have worked out. (she goes to the door) Think about it. \nShe leaves. \nANGLE ON - THE BROKEN PICTURE \nEXT. SAN FRANCISCO - CHARLIE'S CAR - DUSK \nCharlie and his best friend, TONY SPILETTI, are out for a night on the town. \nTony is second generation Italian-American with very Mediterranean features. They're listening to Teenage Fan Club. They pass Ghierardeli Square. \nCHARLIE Tony, Teenage Fan Club, they're Scottish you know? \nTONY Oh. \nCHARLIE I had that dream again. \nTONY Oh, is that the one where you suspect that a fat man in a diaper, on a lazy susan has interfered with your plans for the evening? \nCHARLIE No, but I have had that one. No, in this one I'm in love... \nTONY Yeah. \nCHARLIE And I say to myself, 'I've finally found somebody that I'm truly comfortable with.' You know when you're so comfortable that you'll let them put makeup on you to see what you would look like if you were a girl. Anyways you know what I do in the dream next? \nTONY You propose? \nCHARLIE (after a pause) No. I die. \nTONY But Charlie, you're a normal suburban guy at heart, from a normal suburban family. Didn't you tell me you always wanted to get married and have a family. \nCHARLIE Yes, but, I'm afraid, okay? There are seven main rites of passage in a man's life. Birth, first day of school, last day of school. Marriage. Kids. Retirement. Death. I'm at marriage. I'm two rites of passage away from death. \nTONY I'm sorry, I wasn't listening. \nTony is doing three-sixties, scoping out beauties, when suddenly his roving eyes lock on a police car directly behind them. He slouches down into his seat. \nTONY Christ. It's the cops. \nCHARLIE Tony, you are a cop. \nTONY I know. Isn't it awful? I work with those guys. They're assholes. \nThe police car passes. \nINT. SPILETTI'S COFFEE HOUSE - NIGHT \nTony and Charlie enter. There is a poet on stage. The club is full of art tarts and college bohemians. They are greeted by the club's owner, GIUSEPPI, an Italian man in his fifties. \nTONY Salve zio mio. \nUNCLE Allora? Che catzo fai, Charlie? \nCHARLIE Hi, Uncle Giuseppi. \nUNCLE Tony, come' stai bello il tuo pappa e' in galera per la terza volta. \nTony's uncle shows them to a table. \nUNCLE I'll have the waitress bring you cappuccino. \nCHARLIE What did your uncle say? \nTONY He says my Dad's back in jail again. \nCHARLIE Ah, I'm sorry, man. \nTONY You know, it's funny I don't even feel related to my parents anymore. I feel like your mom and dad are more like my parents. I feel more Scottish than Italian. \nIN THE JOURNAL \nTHIS POEM SUCKS \nAfter the last line he scratches out the entire poem. He closes the book and turns on the TV set to CNN to veg out. The show is \"What's Cooking! With Burt Wolf.\" \nEXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET \nCharlie is driving in his car. He drives slowly looking for an address. Finds it, slips in to a parking spot in front. \nEXT. BUTCHER'S SHOP - MEATS OF THE WORLD \nAdorning the front are a \"GRAND OPENING\" sign and miniature flags of the world. Charlie goes inside. \nINT. BUTCHER'S SHOP \nIt's a small, hip shop selling specialty meats from around the world. Charlie looks around. Suddenly, an attractive woman in her late twenties, wearing a blood-stained smock enters. It is HARRIET MICHAELS. She has a cleaver in one hand and something bloody in the other. \nHARRIET (angry) Goddamn shoplifter. (conscious of Charlie's presence; holding up bloody meat) But I got him! (smiles) You're next. \nCHARLIE (backing out the door; terrified) I've come at a bad time. \nHARRIET No stay! \nCHARLIE No, no, really... Obviously you've got things you have to do. You've got to dismember the rest of his bloody torso. Dig a makeshift shallow grave. Cover the body with quick lime. Really so much to do, so little time and I'm only in the way here, I'm just gonna go. Good luck. \nHARRIET (referring to meat in hand) Oh, this! Oh, no, this is what he stole. This isn't a piece of him or anything. This is Icelandic Shank. \nCHARLIE I bet it goes well with a nice Chianti. Fittfittfitt. \nHARRIET (laughs) Can I help you? \nCHARLIE Yes. Do you have haggis? \nHARRIET Yes, we do. It's over here in our Scottish Cuts section. One? \nThis is a section under glass flying a Scottish flag, with haggis and various cuts of Scottish meat. \nCHARLIE Yes! I've never been able to find haggis anywhere, except at my parents' house. They're Scottish. \nHarriet rounds the counter and wraps up the haggis. Behind her is the large \"PRUSSIAN VENISON\" sign. \nHARRIET (ringing up his order) That'll be fifteen, seventy-nine. Will there be anything else? \nCHARLIE Yes. I know it's a long shot, but you wouldn't by any chance happen to have any Prussian Venison? \nHARRIET Now where in the world would I get Prussian Venison? \nCharlie's charmed. \nEXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET \nCharlie is driving along listening to Kerouac. We absorb the flavor of San Francisco as he drives down Lombard Street. \nEXT. CHARLIE'S PARENTS' APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT \nAn old crappie apartment building in San Francisco. Charlie's car pulls up. We hear \"SATURDAY NIGHT\" by the Bay City Rollers. \nINT. OUTER HALLWAY OF CHARLIE'S PARENTS' APARTMENT - NIGHT \nCharlie approaches a door. \nCHARLIE (calling up) Mom, Dad, I'm here. \nSTUART (O.S.) We're in here, son. \nThe apartment is a shrine to Scotland. Scottish paraphernalia, miniature Scotty dogs, shortbread tins and, on wall, framed pictures depict famous Scotsmen, Sean Connery, Jackie Stewart, Alexander Graham Bell, James Doohan (Scottie from \"Star Trek\"), Sheena Easton, Billy Connolly. \nCHARLIE'S POV - AS WE ENTER THE LIVING ROOM \nWe see STUART, MAY, TONY, and little WILLIAM, Charlie's fourteen year old little brother all singing: \nCHARLIE Thank you, no. \nMAY Sherri's late. \nCHARLIE Yeah, uh, Sherri and I broke up. \nMAY Oh, you didn't. Sherri was the daughter your father was never able to give me. \nCHARLIE I'm just not ready for marriage. I'm twenty-nine and my poems haven't even been published yet. \nSTUART But it's not just the poetry is it son? You're afraid if you get married you'll lose your muse. Look at me, I was a strapping young butcher, at the height of my creative powers. When it came to de-boning a side of beef, there was nobody that could touch me. Then I married your mother. And people would still stand in awe as I filleted a shoulder of lamb. \nMAY Maybe it's just as well not to get married, look at the news. Where did I put it? \nSTUART Heed. Move that melon of yours into the bathroom and get the paper for your mother. \nWilliam gets the National Enquirer and brings it back. \nCHARLIE That's not news, Dad. That's bullshit. I wouldn't wipe my ass with that paper. \nSTUART What are you talking about? It's the fifth highest circulating paper in the United States, I'll have you know. \nMAY Oh, here it is. Mrs. X. The Honeymoon Murderer. She marries men under fake identities, and then murders them. She killed some German martial arts expert, and some plumber named Ralph Elliot. Her whereabouts are unknown. \nThere's another goal on the TV set. \nSTUART Scores! Two nil. Magic! \nTONY Ah, beautiful goal. We HOLD on the TV set. \nTime passes. The TV set \nCROSS FADES: \nTO THE END OF THE GAME \nThe two teams are shaking hands. And the final scores chyron shows Celtic beating Rangers three nothing. We see Charlie and Tony are leaving. Stuart is blind drunk. \nSTUART (singing Rod Stewart's song) YOU'RE IN MY EYES, YOU'RE IN MY DREAMS... YOU'RE CELTIC, UNITED AND BABY I'VE DECIDED... \nMAY Ah, you're steaming. \nShe meets Charlie and Tony at the door and kisses him good- bye. She turns to kiss Tony, and holds on the kiss far too long. \nTONY (pulling away) See you later, Mrs. MacKenzie. \nMAY Oh, you've turned into a sexy Italian bastard. \nCHARLIE See you later, mom. (calling out) See you later, Dad. \nSTUART Fine. Go! You've stayed your hour. \nCharlie and Tony leave and enter... \nTHE HALLWAY \nwhere they find William sitting on the stairs waiting for them. \nWILLIAM Take me with you. \nEXT. MEATS OF THE WORLD - LATE AFTERNOON \nCharlie's drives by and notices Harriet, who's unwinding the store awning in Dutch national costume. The banner announces \"DUTCH WEEK.\" \"MEATS OF THE WORLD SALUTES DUTCH MEAT.\" \nCharlie slows down to look at her. She looks great in her little Dutch costume. \nINT. CITY LIGHTS BOOKSTORE - DAY \nCharlie is again writing at the counter. Another PERSON enters. \nMAN Excuse me. You wouldn't happen to have... \nEXT. PIER - NIGHT \nCharlie and Harriet are eating hot-dogs. As Charlie puts the relish on, he smells the relish. \nCHARLIE (sniffing the relish) This reminds me of my ex-girlfriend. \nHARRIET I hate talking about old relationships. \nCHARLIE Then let's not and say we did. \nHARRIET (she laughs) That was easy -- What a nice guy. You've probably never done a mean thing in your life. \nCHARLIE You'd be surprised. \nHARRIET I'd like to hear. (to his confused look) Name me something bad you've done in your life. \nCHARLIE Are you kidding me? \nHARRIET No. Did you ever steal anything? You ever hit someone? \nCHARLIE Well, I've been in fights. Let me think. \nHARRIET (as Charlie thinks) Not one bad thing, Charlie? \nCHARLIE Tell me something bad you've done. And it better be bad. I mean, evil. \nHARRIET How evil? \nCHARLIE Really evil. (thinks) Like how many people have you brutally murdered? \nHARRIET \"Brutal\" is such a subjective word. I mean, what's brutal to one person might be totally reasonable to another. \nNext to them is a German couple, speaking German, looking through a coin-operated binocular. He says something which causes her to cry. \nCHARLIE This just reminded her of that scene in \"Brian's Song\". \nHARRIET Actually, he just proposed to her. Those are tears of joy. \nShe lifts her soda to toast them. \nHARRIET Prost. \nThe man and woman smile and nod. \nMAN Danke, Fraulein. \nCHARLIE You're very smart. It's a shame I'm going to have to destroy you. \nHARRIET Do bright women intimidate you? \nCHARLIE No, not at all. \nHARRIET Really, what do you look for in women you date? \nCHARLIE (thinks) Well, I know everyone always say \"sense of humor\", but I'd have to go with breast size. (she laughs) How about you? In a guy. \nHARRIET Income of course, and then... (thinks) ...savings. \nHe smiles at her. \nCHARLIE Me likey how you thinkey. \nINT. HARRIET'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThe lights turn on, and then they enter a very bohemian apartment. There is artists paraphernalia strewn around. A small bar separates the living area from the kitchen. She smiles and walks off into the kitchen. \nHARRIET I'll make us some tea. \nHe checks out her apartment. On the wall there is a huge poster of the BOARDWALK IN ATLANTIC CITY. \nCHARLIE Hey, you know what this apartment needs? A really large oversized poster of Atlantic City. \nROSE Go away. \nCHARLIE Oh God. I'm sorry. Jesus. Excuse me. \nHe backs out of the room. \nINT. HALLWAY - HARRIET'S APARTMENT \nThe door opens and a hurriedly dressed Charlie emerges. Before he gets to the door he once again encounters Rose. She's completely dressed. Even her hair is dry. \nCHARLIE Hi. I'm really sorry. I must have scared the... I'm Harriet's friend, Charlie, and you must be... (hopefully) Ralph? \nROSE I'm Harriet's sister, Rose. And this is Harriet's note. \nHe reaches for it, but she reads it aloud to him. \nROSE (reading) 'Dear Charlie, I didn't want to wake you, make yourself at home, thanks for making me smile.' Harriet. \nCHARLIE That's a very nice note. \nROSE I'll make you some breakfast. \nCHARLIE Gee, I'd love to but I'm running late. \nROSE What would you say to blueberry pancakes, bacon, fresh squeezed grape juice and Kona coffee? \nINT. KITCHEN - LATER \nCharlie and Rose sit at the table each eating a bowl of dry cereal. \nROSE I'm sorry I didn't have any of those other things. \nCHARLIE Hey, that stuff'll kill you while Fruit Loops are light and probably reasonably high in Fiber. I like Apple Jacks too. \nROSE Got 'em. \nCHARLIE So this is your apartment? \nRose starts sketching Charlie. \nROSE Yes. She's been here the past three months... ever since she came back from Miami. I used to visit her occasionally. She didn't speak of me? \nCHARLIE (shakes his head, no) She told me about a martial arts guy and there was some discussion about Ralph... \nROSE She spoke of them...? \nCHARLIE She spoke of the martial arts guy and screamed about Ralph... \nROSE (affectionately) Well, you know Harriet. \nCHARLIE Actually, I really don't. \nROSE (puzzled) But you did have sex with her? \nCHARLIE (taken aback) Hello. \nROSE Yet you still don't know her. (contemplates this) See, that's the problem with sex. It's not very revealing. \nCHARLIE My, look at the time. \nHe stands up. \nROSE (after a pause) You should be careful, Charlie. \nCHARLIE I am... usually. I just... You should know, this is very unusual that I would do this so soon, in this day and age particularly, but... We just really hit it off. We did. And... \nROSE I'm gonna go now. I won't tell Harriet that anything happened. \nCHARLIE But... nothing did happen. \nROSE Exactly. Or she would be jealous. And when she gets jealous, we both know what she's capable of. \nCHARLIE Exactly. That's what's gonna be different this time. Something strange happens, let it go. It's not my business... Like Ralph. She says Ralph in her sleep. \nTONY Who's Ralph? \nCHARLIE I don't know who Ralph is. Moreover, I don't want to know. \nTONY Good. \nPARK RANGER And as if blinding his \"bitch\" wasn't enough retribution for Kelly, the next day he and four other inmates took turns pissing into the \"bitch's\" ocular cavity. \nTony and Charlie look at each other. They're a little queasy. \nCHARLIE Exactly. (beat) Tony, I'm happy. Don't let me screw this one up. \nINT. EL TORO - IN THE MISSION - DAY \nThey are eating Bay burrites. \nROSE Did you have a nice date last night? \nHARRIET Rose, I don't really -- \nROSE He disturbed me while I was naked in the shower this morning. \nHARRIET Yeah, he stayed over? \nROSE I didn't mind. Charlie and I laughed about it over breakfast. \nHARRIET That's good. \nROSE He said you had great sex last night. \nHARRIET He did? (a beat) Yeah. \nROSE He seems really stuck on you. I hope for you that it lasts. \nHARRIET Rose he's a sweet, kind and loving person. We like each other, but I don't want to think any further. It's taken me a long time to get back to dating, and I want to take things real steady this time. \nROSE Well, you can trust me not to tell him anything. \nHARRIET He was quite happy not to talk about the past. \nROSE I did a sketch of him. \nRose shows the sketch to Harriet. \nHARRIET (looking at the picture) That's good. \nROSE Think I've caught him? \nHARRIET The eyes are good. \nROSE Charlie really liked it. \nHARRIET It's a good likeness. \nROSE Boy, I really hope it works out. \nHARRIET Rose, I don't wanna screw this one up. \nEXT. HARRIET'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY \nCharlie enters the building, holding a handful of poetry books. He passes a UNIFORMED DELIVERY GUY coming out. The guy nods and Charlie nods back. \nINT. HARRIET'S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS \nCharlie gets three feet down the hallway. Stops in his tracks and heads back to the front door. He opens it and yells to the delivery guy: \nCHARLIE Hey, uh... Ralph...? \nDELIVERY GUY (turning around) I'm Gilbert. \nHARRIET She's just being kind. Show Charlie one of your photographs, Rose. Rose is a great artist. \nROSE No, Harriet. I don't want to. They're not good. \nHARRIET You're so modest. If I weren't here to brag for you, I just don't know... (taking out a posterboard from cabinet) Show it to him, Rose. Do it. \nHe turns it over and there is a picture there. A collage of unrelated images put together. And it is beautiful. \nBut it's very abstract. Violent perhaps. Confused definitely. He likes it. \nCHARLIE It's beautiful... \nROSE Thanks. \nCHARLIE What is it? \nROSE I dunno. \nCHARLIE What do you call it? \nROSE I dunno. \nCHARLIE A lot artists don't like to title their work. They feel it biases the viewer. \nROSE It is titled. It's called \"I dunno\". \nCharlie looks at it again, then at Rose, then at Harriet. It's all a little bizarre, but in a funny way he feels for Rose. A hidden talented overshadowed by her sister's beauty. \nHARRIET We should get going, Charlie. Thanks, Rose... See you later. \nROSE Bye, Charlie. \nCHARLIE Rose, great to see you. We should all go out together some time. The three of us. That would be great. That would be... interesting. \nCharlie and Harriet walk out. \nEXT. POETRY FESTIVAL - NIGHT \nCharlie and Harriet wait in line with bohemian types and poetry lovers from the suburbs, and all walks of life. Directly behind them are TWO OLD LADIES. The marquee reads: \"POETRY FESTIVAL - TONIGHT ALLEN GINSBERG.\" \nCHARLIE I think you're going to love Alan Ginsberg. He's great. \nHARRIET Oh, I know all about him. \nTONY (O.S.) Hey Charlie! \nTony is getting out of a cab accompanied by Susan, the girl from Spiletti's Coffee House. He approaches Charlie. \nTONY Sorry we're late. \nTony throws his arms wide open and hugs one of the Little Old Ladies on the other side of Charlie. \nTONY You must be Harriet. I've heard a lot about you. \nCHARLIE (to Tony; re: Harriet) This is Harriet. \nTONY Oh. Sorry. Of course. (whispering to Harriet) I apologize. Charlie described you as much older. And heavier. \nHARRIET (smiling) Oh, he did...? \nCHARLIE Thank you, Tony. This is my best friend. \nTONY And this is Susan. Charlie, you remember her from Uncle Giuseppi's. \nCHARLIE Yes, I do. \nSUSAN You're funny... \nThen she GIGGLES. The girls start inside, Tony lags back with Charlie. \nTONY (whispers to Charlie) I give Susan one night. \nCHARLIE Was that before Atlantic City, or after? \nHARRIET Oh, that was years ago. Atlantic City was recent. I didn't care for Atlantic City. A town full of gamblers and lounge singers. \nHe keeps driving. \nINT. POLICE STATION - DAY \nCharlie walks through the precinct towards Tony's office, holding the National Enquirer in his hand. \nDESK SERGEANT Hey Charlie! \nCHARLIE Is Tony back there? \nThe Sergeant nods and Charlie heads back to the office. \nINT. POLICE STATION - DAY \nCAPTAIN O.K., Tony. Do you have the K673 form completed yet, that street vendor incident on Powell Street? \nTONY (really bummed) Yes, Captain. \nCAPTAIN Tony, do you mind my saying that you seem a little down? \nTONY Captain. It's about my work. About being a policeman. \nCAPTAIN Tony, if there's anything wrong, I'm here to listen. \nTONY I know. And that's what's irritating, you're too nice. \nCAPTAIN Too nice!? \nTONY Yes, You're my captain for gods sakes. You should be constantly on my case, like the captain on Starsky and Hutch. Once a week you should routinely haul my ass into your office, accuse me of being a maverick and complain to me that you're sick and tired of defending my screwball antics to the commissioner. \nCAPTAIN Well, as you may know, Tony. I don't report to a commissioner. I report to a committee, some of whom are appointed, some elected and the remainder co-opted on a bi-annual basis. A quorum -- \nTONY Police work should be all about running around, following up crazy hunches that turn out to be right, going out on a limb. \nCAPTAIN Well Tony, I've never seen it that way. For me police work is all about following procedure and remaining accountable to the general public. \nTONY (exasperated) Captain! When I joined the police force, I thought I was going to be Serpico and unfortunately I ended up being Toma. I would have settled for Beretta. \nCAPTAIN That's interesting Tony. I'm perturbed that you should be so disillusioned. \nCharlie enters. \nCHARLIE Hey, Tony, I gotta talk to you. \nCAPTAIN Oh, hello, Charlie. Look, I'm in the way here. You guys probably have something you want to talk about, and Tony, if you've still got stuff you want to sort out, please, you know where the suggestion box is. \nThe Captain exits. \nCHARLIE Nice guy. Hey, what's up? \nTONY I'm having doubts about being a cop again. It's not like how it is on cop shows. All I do is fill out papers and reports. \nCHARLIE Let me get this straight, your Captain hasn't threatened to have you up on charges so fast you won't know what hit you? \nTONY No! He's never once said to me that he was going to \"throw the book at me so hard it'll knock my ass from here till Tuesday.\" Anyways what's up? \nCharlie pulls out the National Enquirer (the one on MRS. X, the Honeymoon Killer). \nCHARLIE Have you heard of this case? Mrs. X? She murders her husbands on their honeymoons and then changes her identity and marries again. \nTONY I never heard of it. So what? \nCHARLIE Curious, that's all. I read about it, and... (after a pause) I think I'm dating Mrs. X. \nTONY (after a pause) Two words, Charlie. Get therapy. They have doctors that deal specifically with this illness. \nCHARLIE Everything's adding up, Tony. One of the victims was a martial arts expert. Last night at dinner, she put a martial arts move on my dad. \nHARRIET Well, good night. \nCHARLIE Good night. \nShe doesn't close her eyes. He's scared to close his. Pause. \nCHARLIE Well... good night. \nHARRIET (smiling) Good night. \nThey both look over at each other. She closes her eyes. He takes a deep breath and then closes his eyes. \nAnd covers his ear with his hand. \nINT. BART PLATFORM - DAY \nCharlie is on the crowded platform. Next to him is an old lady with a lot of shopping bags. Three kids on skateboards whiz by and accidentally knock bags out of her hands. Cat toys and cans of cat food go everywhere. Charlie bends down and starts to help her gather her stuff. \nLADY Thank you very much, young man. I've gotta get all this stuff back to my children. \nCHARLIE Your children? \nLADY When I say my children I mean my cats. You see my children moved out years ago, so all I've got is my cats. I have over one hundred of them. \nCHARLIE That's a lot of cats. \nHARRIET (O.S.) Charlie. \nCharlie looks up and sees Harriet waving to him from the subway stairs. He waves back and motions. \"I'll be there in a second\", and continues to help the old lady. She watches from the stairs. \nLADY You see this red toy? That's for the Captain, he's finicky. and this blue one? That's for Marco Polo. \nTwo train headlights are seen off in the distance. \nCHARLIE Do you have a name for all of your cats? \nLADY Oh, yes. \nCharlie glances over at Harriet, who slowly makes her way down the platform towards him. \nLADY Let me see! There's Winston Churchill, Reda Sovine, Thomas Edison, Andrew Carnegie... \nThe train is getting closer and closer, and so is Harriet. \nCHARLIE ...He was Scottish. \nHarriet moves forward a step, Charlie moves back a step. \nLADY Wasn't he Irish? \nAs Harriet seems to get closer Charlie continues to back up, picking up cat toys. Charlie realizes he has no where else to turn. so he side steps down the platform, never stopping his conversation with the lady. \nCHARLIE Actually he was Scottish. Trust me, I know these things. \nHarriet is moving in on him. Charlie steadily makes his way down the platform, feigning accidentally kicking cat food down the platform. The old lady is unsure what is going on, she tries to keep up with him. \nLADY Now that you say it, he was Scotch. \nCharlie runs out of platform. Harriet is very close to him. The train is closer, so is Harriet. Charlie lets out a scream. \nCHARLIE Noooooo! \nCharlie is standing at the edge of the platform, Harriet is a good six or seven feet away as the train passes by. Charlie is safe. People are all staring at Charlie curiously, including Harriet and the old lady. Charlie is embarrassed. \nCHARLIE (embarrassed) Nooooooo, Scotch is a drink. Scots are a people. Sorry, that just always bugged me. \nNo one knows what is going on. \nLADY I'm sorry, I didn't know it meant so much to you. \nCHARLIE Hi, Harriet. \nCHARLIE The truth. Okay. The truth is... \nShe is so close to him, and so very beautiful, it's distracting. \nCHARLIE The truth is... I'm afraid that you are... (he can't) You're going to laugh. \nHARRIET I don't think so. \nCHARLIE Okay... the truth is that I'm afraid you're going to ki... leave me. \nHARRIET I'm going to \"cleave you?\" What does that mean? \nCHARLIE Leave me. Not \"cleave me.\" Reject me. And so I decided to take matters into my own hands and get it over with by... \nHARRIET Rejecting me. \nCHARLIE (he feels awful) Purely preventive... It's not anything you've done. \nHARRIET I know that... So why are you leaving me? \nCHARLIE (heartbroken) Harriet, maybe I'm not meant to be in a relationship. \nA single tear runs down her cheek. She brushes it away quickly. \nCHARLIE I never wanted to hurt you. \nHARRIET You haven't. At least you left early on. (she's crying) So, that's it, then. I've got a lot of work to do. (to Customer) Now, where were we? \nCharlie goes. \nINT. SPILETTI'S COFFEE HOUSE - NIGHT \nCharlie lies on the bar head down. Tony rushes in, looks around and sees Charlie. \nCHARLIE (without lifting head) Two hours and four minutes. Tony, I need you, and two hours and four minutes later you show up. \nTONY Sorry. I know it was irresponsible to stay at the drug bust until it was over, but... What happened? \nCHARLIE (slowly sitting up) I'm gonna tell you, but when I do, just say nothing. Don't judge me. Just be my friend. Okay? \nTONY Fine. Okay. \nCHARLIE I broke up with Harriet. \nTONY You're an asshole. \nCHARLIE What's your point? \nTONY I'm sorry, I just... why? \nCHARLIE Tony, she's a killer. The... everything. \nTONY But nothing's proven. The only thing you're actually sure she did so far is she's treated you like a King. \nCHARLIE I dunno, Tony, I just... \nTONY Besides, everyone has something going on with them. I mean, you can't find everything in one person. I mean, she's bright, she's funny, she's independent. So maybe, and it's really just a maybe, she kills her husbands. Marriage is give and take, Man. You take the good with the bad. \nINT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT \nCharlie lies in bed. He's writing in his journal. He stares out into space. Inspired, he writes... \nANGLE ON THE JOURNAL \nDON'T BE DISILLUSIONED BY THE SCOTTISH SON AS HE FLIES, IN BAT-LIKE UNISON \nCHARLIE \npauses a moment to reflect, then writes... \nANGLE ON THE JOURNAL \nCHARLIE (through door) Harriet, it's me, Charlie. \nHARRIET (O.S.) Go away, Charlie. \nCHARLIE I've gotta talk to you, cause I miss you, and I made a mistake... and if you give me another chance I'll change. I will. I promise. I'll get help, or therapy, or... Yeah, that'll be great. Therapy. Even twice a week. I'll check with my insurance to see if I'm covered, but forget that. Harriet... \nThe chain opens on the door. \nHARRIET You really hurt me. \nCHARLIE I'll make it up to you, can we at least talk. \nHARRIET Sure, talk. \nRose steps up behind Charlie. \nROSE (O.S.) Hi, Charlie. \nCHARLIE AAAhhhhhh. \nROSE (as she now proceeds to be let in by Harriet) Trust your first instincts, Charlie. You never do. It's your big mistake. That and the haircut. \nOnce again, baffled by Rose, Charlie touches his hair, shakes it off and looks Harriet right in the eye. \nCHARLIE I don't want to lose you. \nHARRIET You didn't lose me. You rejected me. \nCHARLIE I'm unrejecting you. \nHARRIET How do I know you won't reject me again? \nCHARLIE I love you. \nHARRIET (after a long pause) I love you. But you blew it, Charlie, you blew it. \nShe goes into the house. Charlie stands there dejected. He knows he's blown it. \nINT. HARRIET'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nHarriet is doing a load of laundry consisting of bloodied work clothes. Suddenly she can hear the sound of MUSIC, very loudly. \nAnnoyed, she goes out her front door to tell her neighbors off. Just as she's about to knock on the door, she realizes it's not the source of the music. At that moment her neighbor, who is a STEWARDESS, comes out in nightclothes. \nSTEWARDESS I don't mean to be a pain, but I'm a stewardess, and I have an early flight out in the morning. Can you please keep your music down? \nHARRIET I thought it was coming from here. \nSTEWARDESS But someone keeps shouting your name over and over. \nPuzzled, Harriet rushes back to her own balcony. \nEXT. HARRIET'S APARTMENT - BALCONY - NIGHT \nHarriet rushes out and smiles as she sees the source of the noise. Charlie serenades Harriet in the street below, accompanied by a TRUMPETER with a MUTE, a DOUBLE BASS PLAYER AND A GUY ON A SNARE. \nCHARLIE HARRIET, HARRIET HARD-HEARTED HARBINGER OF HAGGIS BEAUTIFUL, BEMUSED BELLICOSE BUTCHER UNTRUST-ING UNKNOW-ING UNLOV-ING HE WANTS YOU BACK HE SCREAMS INTO THE NIGHT AIR LIKE A FIREMAN GOING TO A WINDOW THAT HAS NO FIRE EXCEPT THE PASSION OF HIS HEART I AM LONELY, IT'S REALLY HARD THIS POEM SUCKS \nA crowd has gathered in the street and spectators group on their balconies. They break out into APPLAUSE. Charlie proudly takes the applause and bows to Harriet. She throws him a flower. He's won her back. \nINT. BATHTUB - HARRIET'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nRomantic with candles surrounding the tub. Harriet and Charlie are bathing together. Wherever one of them moves, the water extinguishes a candle and Charlie lights it. This is keeping him pretty busy. \nHARRIET I've been there for almost a year. I only planned on stay with her for a few weeks, but she gets upset every time I say I'm moving. \nCHARLIE You were close as kids? \nHARRIET I pretty much raised her. You know the scene. Depressed mother... withdrawn father. (she remembers) My dad was a photographer too. \nCHARLIE Really? \nCHARLIE Hey Dad, I got an anniversary present for you... \nStuart looks up, and Charlie gets him in a headlock and pins him to the ground. \nSTUART I'm proud of you, son. I'm proud of you. (Stuart addresses the group) I just wanna propose a toast. To my wife. Forty five years ago today May and I got married. Some of you were there, some of you weren't born yet, some of you are now dead, but... We both said, \"I do\" and we haven't agreed on a single thing since. But, I'm glad I married you May cause... It could have been worse and besides... I still love you. \nThey kiss and everyone APPLAUDS. Uncle Angus breaks into, \"Stand By Your Man.\" May and Stuart start to dance. Charlie looks at another young couple who are touched by this sincere display of love. He looks over at Harriet. Stuart and May feed each other cake. Charlie approaches Harriet. \nCHARLIE Harriet, I wanna talk to you. \nHARRIET Boy, you really made some impression with Ralph. She can't get over you. \nCHARLIE (stalling; nervous) I'm just so happy for you to have friends like Ralph. What a great friend to have. \nHARRIET Is everything all right, Charlie? You're perspiring. \nCHARLIE Harriet... marry me. \nHARRIET What? \nCHARLIE I want to have a wedding. With you. \nHARRIET No. \nCHARLIE Please. \nHARRIET I don't know, Charlie. It's so good like it is. Why don't we just live together first? \nCHARLIE Because, I love you and I want you to marry me and be with me for 45 years. I want you to have my children, and I want to have your children. I know that sounds like a lot of children, and they might not all get along, but... I'm finally ready to trust you and to make a commitment. Marry me, Harriet, please. Be my wife. \nHarriet flinches slightly at the word \"Wife\", but Charlie is too wrapped up in the moment to notice. Stuart addresses the group. \nSTUART I'd like to thank Charlie for throwing us this party. I hope some day you have the same great 45 years that we've had. \nPeople clap and smile. Harriet looks at Charlie. He has tears in his eyes. \nHARRIET Yes. \nAt first it doesn't register. Then... \nCHARLIE You will? \nShe smiles. \nHARRIET Let's get married, Charlie. \nThey kiss. \nMAY (from across room) Harriet, come here a minute. I want you and Uncle Angus to play a song together. \nHarriet and Charlie kiss one last time and she goes to the piano. \nCharlie stays in the corner, and Tony comes over. \nTONY Hey, sorry I'm so late. What's happening? \nCHARLIE Nothing. Nothing at all. Just two little things... (as Tony looks in) That woman over there in the corner... She's Harriet's friend, and her name is Ralph. \nTONY No shit. \nCHARLIE And secondly... That woman over there... (Re: Harriet) That's Harriet, and we're getting married. \nTONY (excited) Fantastic... What did I tell you. She's a great girl. And the last thing in the world she'd be is a murderer. \nAnd then Harriet begins singing at the piano. \nHARRIET (singing) ONLY YOU... CAN MAKE THIS WORLD SEEM RIGHT... ONLY YOU... CAN MAKE THIS DARKNESS LIGHT...\" \nTony and Charlie look at each other. \"Only you?\" Then Charlie looks at his bride with confidence. \nHe walks over and joins her. She sings to him. It's a moment. \nHARRIET Sorry. The flash just... \nThe band kicks into a new dance. A YOUNG BOY comes up to the bagpipe man with a shot of whiskey and whispers into his ear. The bagpipe man stops the song, downs the whiskey and then breaks into Rod Stewart's \"IF YOU THINK I'M SEXY.\" From across the room we hear Stuart singing. \nSTUART (full volume; singing) IF YOU THINK I'M SEXY... AND YOU WANT MY BODY... COME ON BABY LET ME KNOW. \nStuart gives the Bagpiper the thumbs up. The young people in the room start to jam, and then one by one the other guests start getting into the swing of things. The bagpipe man continues playing. It is clear that he is far too drunk to play. He slowly keels over, drunk. And as he falls over face first, he lands on his Bagpipes. The bagpipes let out an ATONAL DEFLATING SOUND like the last dying throes of a tortured animal. The BAGPIPE WAIL extends into the next scene. \nEXT. HIGH ABOVE COAST - DAY \nCHARLIE (V.O.) Wait 'til you see this place, Harriet. \nINT. CHARLIE'S CAR - DAY \nThey drive along the beautiful coast. Harriet is still eating. They're listening to TEENAGE FAN CLUB. \nCHARLIE This is Teenage Fan Club. They're from Scotland. \nHARRIET They're great. \nCHARLIE We'll have the whole lodge to ourselves practically. \nHARRIET I can't wait, Charlie. \nCHARLIE I wish you could be me, so you could know how great it feels to be with you. \nHARRIET It sounds wonderful \nCHARLIE Do you think that would be a good line for a poem? \nHARRIET Honestly? It sounds a little Hallmark. \nCHARLIE Yeah, it's a little Seals and Croft. I have a habit of sabotaging relationships, and there were a million times during me and you that I could have blown this, and I just thank God that I didn't... \nINT. POLICE STATION - DAY \nTony is at his desk. The captain kicks open the door, knocking Tony's feet off the desk. The captain is now dressed in suspenders, a loosened tie, and a shirt with pit stains. \nCAPTAIN O.K., Spiletti, I got word from upstairs that you been pokin' your nose into that Ralph Elliot case. \nTONY Yes, Captain. \nCAPTAIN Don't \"yes, Captain\" me, Spiletti. You're outta line. This is strictly homicide. \nTONY Captain, I got this friend... \nCAPTAIN Friend? Yeah, we all got friends, Spiletti. I'm warning you, Stay away from this one. Back off, Italian boy. You're getting too close to this one. \nTONY Captain, I know what I'm doing. Trust me. What's the news. \nCAPTAIN I can't believe I'm doing this, but that girl who confused to Ralph Elliot's murder also confessed to other murders. \nTONY I knew she would! I knew it! \nCAPTAIN Yeah, apparently she also confessed to killing Abe Lincoln, Julius Caesar, and Warren G. Harding. She's a nut, Spiletti! \nTONY (getting up) Oh, my god! I gotta go! \nCAPTAIN Yeah, screw this one up Spiletti and you'll be writing parking tickets for the rest of your days. \nTONY I won't let you down, Captain. \nTony exits for a beat, then pokes his head in the doorway. \nTONY That's much better Captain. \nCAPTAIN (nice again) You think so? Well, thank you very much. \nEXT. POLICE STATION - DAY \nTony hurries to his car. \nROSE It didn't come out. \nTONY Look, Rose. I need a photo. \nROSE The picture didn't come out. (he waits) It was unflattering. In made her look ten pounds heavier. (he waits) She's my sister. \nTONY She's been implicated in a crime. I need the photo to eliminate her as a suspect. \nROSE And if she's not innocent. If she's, you know, \"quirky?\" \nTONY If she's \"quirky\" we'll save Charlie's life. \nRose pulls out a photograph -- Charlie and Harriet. Looking young and in love. \nEXT. DRY CREEK LODGE - LATE IN THE DAY \nA beautiful old Colonial Mansion, nestled in the mountains and forests of the North-West. Romantic and from another day. Charlie and Harriet pull up in front of it. \nThe Valets open the door for them. \nHARRIET It's like a castle, Charlie. It's so beautiful. \nVALET Welcome to the Dry Creek. You just beat the rainstorm. Two hours later and the roads'd probably be closed. \nCHARLIE Great. If you could help us with the luggage, we have these two in the back seat and... \nAs they deal with the luggage, Harriet starts to walk away from the hotel, away from the car, rain falling on her head. She walks straight at the CAMERA, so only we can see her expression. Her expression is one of simply \"losing it\". \nCHARLIE Harriet? What are you doing honey? \nHarriet turns around and smiles at Charlie. He smiles back. \nINT. LOBBY OF DRY CREEK LODGE - EVENING \nCharlie and Harriet stand at the desk. Harriet is not quite paying attention. Her attention span has slipped to none. She's fidgety. She looks around suspiciously at everything and everyone. \nDESK CLERK Welcome, Sir. We have you with us for four nights, Mr. MacKenzie. Dinner reservations are at eight-thirty. \nCHARLIE Great. Sounds terrific. \nDESK CLERK Also, you might wanna prepare some candles by the bed. We're expecting the rainstorm to get even worse. We might even lose the power tonight. \nCHARLIE Did you hear that, Harriet? A storm. I can't think of anything more romantic than the two of us trapped in our room in the middle of a rain storm. (noticing her) You okay, Harriet? \nHARRIET Just a little head-ache. (to clerk) Excuse me, is there a drug store in the hotel? I want to get some aspirin. \nDESK CLERK Right beyond those trees, Ma'm. Anything you need. \nHARRIET Thanks. Don't go anywhere. I'll be right back. \nHarriet walks off to the lobby store, backwards, looking at Charlie. Charlie watches her walk off. The Desk Clerk sits staring at Charlie. \nDESK CLERK You think she's really got a head- ache? \nCHARLIE What? \nDESK CLERK Ah, nothing. Here's your key. You're in the Oak Room. \nCharlie looks back at the drug store, where Harriet is shopping. She waves to him. Charlie looks back at the Desk Clerk and grabs the key. \nCUT TO: \nFAX OF THE PHOTO OF CHARLIE & HARRIET \ncoming out of a fax machine. \nINT. WALTER'S PLUMBING - EARLY EVENING \nWALTER, the owner of the Plumbing store, dressed in overalls takes the Fax out and then picks up the phone. \nWALTER That's Ralph Elliot's wife, alright. She had shorter hair in those days. \nCHARLIE Of course. Sure... \nCharlie gives her hand away to Mr. Levenstein. He takes Mrs. Levenstein's hand and starts to dance towards the EXIT, when suddenly the ELECTRICITY GOES OUT. The MUSIC is out. The LIGHTS ARE OUT. \nIn the dimmest of lights provided from the cloud covered moon outside, Charlie runs across the dance floor, fighting for an exit to the outside. \nHe arrives in someone's arms on his way. \nCHARLIE I need your help! You have to help me! I've married a...! \nThe LIGHTS GO BACK ON and Charlie is in HARRIET'S ARMS again. Her face is near menacing now. She smiles a very disturbed grin. He doesn't know what to say. \nHARRIET (much too pleasant) Hello, Charlie. \nCharlie and her are squared off. Neither speak. Suddenly both of them are lifted into the air. They look down and see the waiters and busboys picking them up onto chairs, throwing them up in the air again and again. The MUSIC plays along loudly. \nHarriet watches Charlie very closely, as Charlie looks scared. Then, the people start to carry them out of the room and down the hallway. \nWAITER Let's take 'em to their room. \nCONCIERGE Yeah, I'm sure they've had enough of these crowds for one night. \nCHARLIE My dinner. I didn't finish my dinner yet. \nHARRIET Smile, Charlie. Act like you're having a good time. \nINT. OREGON AIRPORT - SAME/NIGHT \nTony is talking to an attractive young girl behind the airport Rent-A-Car booth. \nRENT-A-CAR GIRL I'm sorry, Sir. The roads are all closed. We can't rent any cars this evening. \nTONY You have to rent me something. I've gotta get up there. My friend's in danger... \nINT. CHARLIE & HARRIET'S ROOM - NIGHT \nThe other hotel guests threw them inside. The room is all made up, the sheets are pulled down, the firewood is cut, the AXE is in the wood. \nCONCIERGE Have a good night, you two. \nCHARLIE Come on in. Stay for a nightcap. \nBELLBOY No, you two wanna be alone. See you. \nCHARLIE (demanding) Stay for a nightcap! \nBELLBOY Sir, I really don't think I should \nCHARLIE (shouting) STAY FOR A NIGHTCAP! \nThe bellboy is frightened and runs away. \nCHARLIE (shouting down the hall after him) STAY FOR A NIGHTCAP! \nHarriet pulls Charlie back into the room, frightened that he's leaving. \nHARRIET Don't go, Charlie. \nEXT. AIRPORT - NIGHT \nTony runs out of the airport terminal where he sees a man in his forties who's just entered his four wheel drive jeep. \nTONY (flashing his badge) Excuse me, Sir, I'm with the San Francisco Police Department. I'm on official business and I'm afraid I have to commandeer your vehicle. \nMAN (unfazed) No. \nTONY What do you mean no?! \nMAN I happen to know for a fact that you don't have the power to commandeer my vehicle. \nTONY This is true. (pause) Please can I commandeer your vehicle? \nThen Rose strikes a match. She lights a candle and comes toward him. He looks around. The window is open. And Charlie is gone. \nINT. COMMANDEERED CAR - NIGHT \nTony and the commandeered man drive through the swampy, winding road on the way up to the hotel. Tony is drumming on the dash. \nMAN Could you stop doing that please? \nEXT. CASTLE-LIKE ROUND TOWER/LEDGE OF TOWER - NIGHT \nCharlie tightropes along the ledge of the building. The storm continues. Rose comes out on the ledge and starts to chase him. He rounds the bend. Charlie looks into one room and sees MR. & MRS. LEVENSTEIN there. There's loud OPERA MUSIC playing in the room \nCHARLIE Call the police! \nINT. THE LEVENSTEIN'S ROOM - NIGHT SAME \nThe Levensteins prepare for bed. Charlie races by their window. Then Rose races by. \nCHARLIE Call the police! \nMr. Levenstein closes the curtains. He can't hear. \nEXT. LEDGE - NIGHT \nCharlie races along the slippery ledge, almost falling at several points. Rose then appears on the roof holding the Axe, still. \nROSE (mostly to herself; slurring most words) Charlie, did you like your note? I thought it was pretty accurate. I did all the husbands' notes. I can forge anyone's handwriting, I can write in anyone's style. See, I'm an artist. Harriet isn't an artist. Sure she could get a husband, but she could never have done this. And you know what I'm most proud of? \nCHARLIE What's that, Rose? \nROSE Harriet never knew. She thought they all just left her. I protected her. She's my sister. \nCharlie turns and runs. Rose chases him. \nINT. BEDROOM \nTony breaks into the room with his gun drawn. \nTONY (shouting) Charlie! \nHARRIET (from closet) Tony, is that you? It's me, Harriet. I'm in here. \nCarefully, Tony opens the closet door. \nHARRIET Tony, Rose is trying to kill Charlie. They're out on the ledge. \nTONY (not believing) Get on the floor and put your hands behind your back. \nHarriet willingly goes on the floor. \nHARRIET Sure, anything. You've got to save Charlie. \nTony slaps cuffs on her and takes her to the window. \nINT. BEDROOM \nTony is standing with his back to the window, between it and Harriet. She looks out of the window and screams. \nHARRIET Look! It's Charlie! \nFrom Harriet's POV we see Charlie on the ledge edging along. He stops in horror when he sees Harriet, glances back to the pursuing Rose, and rushes off. \nTony looks behind him out the window. Nobody is there. \nTONY Nice try. \nHARRIET I swear to you... It was Charlie... Look! Now there's Rose! \nRose looks into the room, with the axe in her hand. \nTONY No you don't. \n", "test1_input": "Charlie and Harriet wait outside his parents' door. \nCHARLIE Well, this is it. \nHARRIET It'll be fine. \nThey enter the door. \nINT. CHARLIE'S PARENT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nWe again move along the hallway. We pass the Scottish wall, of fame, Scottie from \"Star Trek\", Sir Walter Scott, Sir Harry Lauder, Sheena Easton, Al Pacino, Billy Connolly, then the CAMERA BACKTRACKS to Pacino, where it HOLDS MOMENTARILY. \nCHARLIE Mom, Dad, we're here. \nMay comes up, wearing a fancy country and western outfit. \nMAY Ah, Charlie is this the wee Harriet. Ah, she's beautiful. \nHARRIET Thank you. \nMAY She's so sweet. I hope you keep her. (calling) Stuart, come out here. You tube. \nWhen he comes up, Stuart is wearing only a shirt with his boxer shorts. \nSTUART Ah, it's the wee Harriet. \nMAY Stuart, put your pants on. \nSTUART Hold your horses. (calling to William) Heed! Pants! \nWilliam comes around the corner with his pants. \nCHARLIE Dad, what's Al Pacino doing on the Scottish wall of fame? \nSTUART Oh, that's for Tony. So, Charlie tells me you're a butcher. Let's talk meat. \nCHARLIE Dad, no one wants to talk shop. Especially butcher shop. \nSTUART Come here. \nStuart gets him in a half-Nelson. \nCHARLIE Ah! Dad, dad I have a back zit, man it kills. \nCharlie struggles to free himself. Stuart turns to greet Harriet. As he reaches out his hand. \nTotally instinctively, Harriet grabs Stuart's hand and twists it behind his back. Charlie is startled, as his date has just gotten Stuart into a Half-Nelson. \nHARRIET (releasing his hand) I'm sorry. I just... You just surprised me. I'm sorry. \nSTUART I like this one Charlie. She's quite a filly. \nHARRIET I'm really embarrassed. \nSTUART Don't be embarrassed about having a good strong butcher's grip. Do you link your own sausage? \nMAY Oh, ignore him. Come have a look at some photos of Charlie when he was a wee'n. \nCHARLIE Oh Mom, don't start with the pictures. \nMAY Ah, Charlie, lighten up. You've got a pickle up your ass. \nCHARLIE (whispering to Harriet) I'm gonna use the bathroom. You be okay alone with them? \nHARRIET (kissing) Fine. Don't worry about it. Hurry. \nThey smile as he leaves the room. \nSTUART Make sure there's paper, Charlie. \nCharlie picks up the pace, scared of what he might hear next. \n", "test1_true": "CHARLIE (shutting her up) Ma, just show her the pictures. \nSTUART And light a match. \nMAY (to Harriet) He always leaves the seat up. He's gotta learn. \nINT. BATHROOM AT PARENTS' - NIGHT \nHe closes the door, and shakes his head. What can he do? Those are his parents. On the wall opposite the toilet is a well-used dart board with pictures of the Queen Mother and Colonel Sanders. Hooked to the magazine caddie is a small container of darts. \nINT. THE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nMay excitedly shows Harriet family photo albums. \nMAY This is Charlie with his Uncle Ecky. He's a policeman in Canada. And our cousins Ruth and Jack. He's just got a restraining order from his wife. She's a lovely girl. This is Billy. He's a member of parliament. He drinks. \nHARRIET What a nice family you have. \nCHARLIE IN THE BATHROOM \nHe doesn't seem in any hurry to leave either. He listens through the door to Harriet enthusiastically looking through old photos. \nCharlie glances down at a stack of National Enquirers on the magazine rack. He flips through a few. \nHe sees one of the absurd headlines: \"ALIEN UFO SEX DIET\" Charlie shakes his head. \nHARRIET (O.S.) (through door) Charlie was the cutest baby. \nSTUART (O.S.) (through door) You okay in there, Charlie? You didn't fall in, did you? \nCHARLIE (through door) Jesus... \nCharlie then looks down at another article in the Enquirer and reads: \n\"WHO'S NEXT FOR MRS. X - THE HONEYMOON KILLER?\" \nIt is the article about Mrs. X -- the axe-murderer who kills her husbands on their honeymoons and then marries again under a different identity. \nIN THE LIVING ROOM \nMay is quickly flipping through a photo album, pointing out pictures of relatives as she goes: \nHARRIET I can't believe the resemblance between you and Charlie, Mrs. MacKenzie. \nINT. CHARLIE IN THE BATHROOM \nWith Harriet speaking in the b.g., Charlie continues reading, now absorbed in the article about the 3 victims: \nHARRIET (O.S.) (through door) You have the same smile. It's so incredible. \n\"VICTIM #1 - THE GERMAN MARTIAL ARTS EXPERT FROM MIAMI\" \n\"VICTIM #2 - THE LOUNGE SINGER FROM ATLANTIC CITY\" \n\"VICTIM #3 - THE SAN FRANCISCO PLUMBER - RALPH ELLIOT\" \nINT. CHARLIE'S CAR - NIGHT - C.U. - HARRIET'S FACE \nSitting in the front seat of Charlie's car, smiling, content, a great meal, a great night out with Charlie and a nice evening with his parents. \nSlowly PAN across the front seat to Charlie. A nervous anxious \"what the hell am I getting myself into\" look on his face. \nCHARLIE So, that was some move you put on my Dad, there. Did you study Karate, or...? \nHARRIET No. Not officially. I dated a guy for a while who ran a studio. \nCHARLIE Oh, the martial arts expert. The north-south guy. Here in San Francisco? \nHARRIET Actually, Miami. \nHe looks straight ahead, trying to act unfazed. But, he's very phased -- his expression is covered in it. \n", "test1_id": 2838, "test2_input": "CHARLIE No, no, not that. Just, in general some photos. Any little snapshot would do. \nROSE I doubt I'd have any. Harriet hates being photographed. \nThe sound of a key in the door as Harriet enters the apartment. \nHARRIET (O.S.) Rose -- did I see Charlie's car out in front? \nROSE We're in here, Harriet. \nHARRIET (walking in) What are you guys doing? \nCHARLIE (covering up) Oh, nothing. Just looking through some of Rose's work. \nROSE ...Charlie wanted a photo of you. \nCHARLIE And that. That too. \nHARRIET Why of me, Charlie? \nCHARLIE Well, sentimental reasons. Something to remind me of you when we're not together. \nShe takes him in her arms and gives him a knee buckling kiss. \nHARRIET There, can you remember that? \nCHARLIE Okay, it's just, I was gonna give one to my parents, too, and... (getting nowhere) Another time would be fine. It's hardly a matter of life and death. \nTV SET - PLAYING THE EVENING NEWS \nNEWS ANCHORMAN (ON TV) In the news tonight, regarding a Beverly Hills Jeweler, Morris Cohan, who died last week, police are now suspecting that Morris's partner, Lawrence Sachs, may have murdered him with an untraceable poison. \nReveal: we are in... \nINT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nCharlie is on a Stair Master, as Harriet walks in wearing a robe. The TV is on in the b.g. \nCHARLIE Where you been? \nHARRIET Downstairs. I have a surprise for you. \nCHARLIE Great. I just wanna do a quick twenty minutes on the Stair Master before bed. \nHarriet drops her robe, and from over her shoulder we see that Charlie prefers what he sees to working out. \nCHARLIE I'll do forty tomorrow. \nHARRIET (getting into bed) I got something much healthier for you than that. \nShe pulls out a milkshake from behind her back. \nCHARLIE What is it? \nHARRIET It's a health shake. Eggs, malt, cinnamon, oranges. It's great. I mixed it up downstairs. \nTHE TV SET \ncontinues on about poisons and poisoners. Charlie glances at it. \nNEWS ANCHORMAN (ON TV) Poisoning has become the second leading method of murder in recent years, due to... \nCharlie watches the TV, looking a bit disturbed. Harriet offers him the shake. \nCHARLIE Oh, look, I'm full. Dinner and... No... \nHARRIET You'll like it Charlie. \nCHARLIE No, really, thanks. \nHARRIET (putting it up to his lips) You won't try it. I spent twenty minutes making it. \n", "test2_true": "CHARLIE (sniffing it) Ummm. Smells good. Maybe I'll take some to the office tomorrow. (running into bathroom) I'm gonna brush my teeth. Be right back. \nCharlie goes into the bathroom. \nCHARLIE'S BATHROOM \nHarriet comes into the bathroom and lays the empty glass down on the counter. \nHARRIET I'm gonna take a quick shower. \nCharlie notices the empty glass on the counter. \nCHARLIE Harriet, where did the shake go? \nHARRIET What do you care? I drank it. (getting into shower) You could have at least tried it. You make me feel bad sometimes, Charlie. I don't know why. \nWith her in the shower, he sneaks back into the bedroom and checks the trash can. Nothing. Then he runs around the bed to the other trash can. Nothing. \nHe looks thoroughly confused as she enter the bedroom, wearing a towel. She takes the towel off as she slips underneath the covers. He gets into bed next to her. She gives him a kiss. \nHARRIET Sorry. I'm a little sensitive. You didn't want to drink my milkshake. So what -- right? \nNEWS ANCHORMAN (ON TV) Regarding the murder between the two partners, we talked to Toxicologist Dr. Show on the issue. \nCharlie and Harriet are watching the news show. DOCTOR SHOW is patched in via the Anchorman's close circuit TV. \nNEWS ANCHORMAN (ON TV) Doctor, is it possible that one could be poisoned with no trace at all? \nDOCTOR SHOW (ON TV) Certainly. There are plants that grow very commonly in our own backyard that could easily be fermented into poison. Take for instance the... \nCHARLIE (getting nervous; blocking out TV) Harriet, why don't we shut the light off. \nNEWS ANCHORMAN (ON TV) Really? And how easy it that to do? \nDOCTOR (ON TV) Scarily enough, quite simple. You merely take the... \nCHARLIE (blocking out the TV again) Maybe we should turn the light back on. Yeah that's better. \nHARRIET Charlie, what's the matter? \nCHARLIE Nothing. \nHARRIET Charlie... \nCHARLIE Well, it's just... (re: the TV) The TV. You can't even watch the news these days without getting depressed. \nHARRIET I know, Charlie. And it's not just that. Look at the things people are doing. Partners killing each other... I mean, you hear a story like that, and... who can you really trust these days? \nCHARLIE What do you mean? \nHARRIET It's like, have you ever stood with someone at the edge of a cliff, or the edge of a subway platform, and you think, just for a split second, \"What if I pushed him?\" \nCHARLIE Well, I don't really take the subway ever, so... \nCharlie turns over on his side, she cuddles up behind him. \nHARRIET I'm just making a point of how many times we trust people with our lives. I mean, look at us. If you didn't trust me, you would never be able to fall asleep. \nCHARLIE Why do you say that? \nHARRIET Look at you, you're sleeping. Look how vulnerable you are. I mean, I could do anything at that point. \nCHARLIE (nervous) What could you do? \nHARRIET (sweet and innocent) Anything. You're lying on your side, asleep, I could... stick a needle in your ear. \nCHARLIE (grabbing his ear at the thought) Aahhh! \nHARRIET I'm just making a point of what a good relationship we have. Goodnight, sweetheart. \nHe looks very uneasy. She kisses him and shuts off the light. The moon gives the room an eerie glow. \n", "test2_id": 2839, "test3_input": "CHARLIE No, no. That's a natural fear. I've thought about that fear. \nHARRIET It really worries me, Charlie. \nCHARLIE (quite confused) Well, look, they have, doctors -- I assume -- that deal, only with, webbed feet. And, God Forbid, and I'm talking strictly hypothetically, should that happen, we'll find one. \nHARRIET (kissing him; happy now) You're the greatest Charlie. \nCHARLIE (confused, to say the least) Thanks. We should get ready for dinner. \nEXT./INT. CHARTERED CESSNA - NIGHT \nA small plane flies through the clouds. It's just Tony and DENNIS the pilot. \nDennis never really realizes this is more than a sightseeing tour, and constantly points out scenic points along the way. \nDENNIS Out your left side, you can see the Sierra Nevada, which is the largest mountain range west of the Rockies... \nTONY Great. Rockies. I don't care. Oregon. Move. \nINT. CHARLIE'S HOTEL ROOM AT DRY CREEK LODGE - NIGHT \nCharlie is dressed very sharply in sport coat and tie. He yells into the bathroom where we can see part of Harriet from behind. \nCHARLIE You almost ready? The first seating is in five minutes. \nHARRIET (from other room) I just wanna look good for you, Charlie. That's all. \nCHARLIE I'm sure you look great. I'm sure you look... \nHarriet turns the corner, wearing a nice dress. Her hair looks okay. She's wearing perfume. The only problem is, she has two lines of mascara running down her cheeks. She's been crying. Charlie looks curious. \nHARRIET Do I look okay, Charlie? \nCHARLIE Yes. Well... \nCharlie points to his own eye. \nHARRIET What's wrong? \nCHARLIE Nothing. You kind of look like Tammy Faye Baker right now. \nShe looks in the mirror. \nHARRIET Oh, yeah. \nShe goes back into the bathroom. \nEXT. CESSNA - NIGHT \nThe plane descends towards the runway. The rain comes down hard. \nDENNIS (V.O.) As we prepare to land, we can see off to our left Lake Shanony, which is... \nTONY (V.O.) Just land. Don't worry about Lake Shanony. I don't give a shit about Lake Shanony. \nThe plane touches down. \nEXT. DRY CREEK LODGE - NIGHT \nRain pours fantastically on the gothic castle. Wind blows hard. \nMAN'S VOICE (V.O.) A toast to our new friends, Charlie and Harriet... \nINT. BEAUTIFUL FRENCH RESTAURANT IN HOTEL - NIGHT \nA beautiful dining room with a small dance floor. Charlie sits at an intimate table for two with Harriet. A small band plays in the b.g., as the BAND LEADER is making the toast. The five or six other couples in the restaurant also hold up their glass. \nBAND LEADER ...we're honored to be here for this very special day in... \nThe CONCIERGE at this point interrupts to bring Charlie a TELEPHONE. Everyone stops and watches and waits. \n", "test3_true": "The toast, as well as the entire room, stops -- almost like an E.F. Hutton commercial, waiting for Charlie's phone call to finish. \nCHARLIE (curious) Hello? \nINT. AIRPORT IN OREGON - EARLY EVENING \nTony speaks into the phone frantically. \nTONY Charlie, you okay? \nINTERCUT PHONE CALL \nCHARLIE Great. Couldn't be better. \nTONY Charlie, listen to me! It's her! Harriet is Mrs. X! She killed Ralph and the two other men! \nCharlie looks up across the table at Harriet who is completely caught up in the event of seeing how long she can keep her hand in the candle before it hurts. \nShe puts it in, smiles then takes it out. She shakes her hand, and repeats the process. \nCHARLIE (talking softly) Look, that's great -- it just so happens though, that I met... (louder than he had hoped) Ralph, and much to my delight, not only is she alive, but she's female. I thought I told you. \nHarriet looks at Charlie, very suspiciously. He looks back at her, and tries to smile, pretending that he is having a pleasant, and completely irrelevant conversation. \nTONY Rose had a picture. It checked out. It's her, Charlie. She is the murderer. \nHARRIET Charlie, your food is getting cold. \nCharlie waves \"One Minute\" to Harriet, as she watches. \nCHARLIE So, what do I do? \nTONY I called the police. All the roads are closed, but they're on their way. In the mean time just... \nThe line goes DEAD. \nCHARLIE Hello? (pressing receiver) Hello? \nHARRIET What's a matter, Charlie? \nCHARLIE (to concierge) The phone just went dead. I was on the phone and it went dead. \nCONCIERGE That's quite common, sir. I'm sure the lines'll be out in the whole city 'til tomorrow. Enjoy your meal, Sir. \nThe Concierge takes the phone away. Charlie turns slowly to Harriet, genuinely scared. \nHARRIET What happened, Charlie? \nCHARLIE Nothing... Nothing happened. Just the lines are down. Phone lines. \nSuddenly, the band leader continues with his toast. \nBAND LEADER (over microphone) ...so to these two young people, we wish them a long and happy life together and would like to play their song. The Platters -- \"Only You\". \nThe band starts to play \"Only You\". \nPeople APPLAUD. Harriet and Charlie just stare at each other. He knows. \nThe older couple at the next table, MR. & MRS. LEVENSTEIN, lean over to their table. \nMR. LEVENSTEIN How about the traditional Bride & Groom dance? \nAnother couple walks by and pulls them literally out of the their seats and onto the dance floor. \nOTHER COUPLE Come on. It's a tradition. \nCharlie finds himself in the middle of the dance floor dancing slowly with Harriet. He's scared out of his mind. The music plays in the background. Harriet smiles strangely at him. He tries to smile back, checking all the Exits, planning an escape. \nThen suddenly, call it luckily, MR. LEVENSTEIN, interrupts: \nMR. LEVENSTEIN Excuse me. Could I cut in on your dance? \n", "test3_id": 2840}

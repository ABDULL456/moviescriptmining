Chloe straddles Ricky on his desk chair, making out with him. She holds out her arm and takes a picture on her phone. A little blackberry flash hits them, with her in a slutty pose up next to him.

Marc and the girls, all done up sit in a booth and get bottle service. A big bottle of vodka is brought over. 
CLOSE UP: They leave a stack of cash. 
CUT TO: 
Marc and the girls dance in slightly slow-motion. 
We hear dreamy, almost ominous tonal music as they dance instead of the club music. They sway in a dreamy trance, light gleaming around them, outlining their hair. 
MARC (O.S.) When we went out, we got in everywhere and everyone loved us...and we had so many beautiful, gorgeous things.

77   INT. MARC'S GRANDMA'S BASEMENT                                 77 CLOSE UP: pan over his beautiful, gorgeous things. 
Marc is stashing a bunch of his loot in a basement. 
We see him take a last look at a Louis Vuitton suitcase packed full of luxury bags and designer fashion. 
Quilted Chanel bags in every color, Louboutin patent leather platform heels, Marc Jacobs crisp shirts. 
He touches them, and makes sure they're all tucked away carefully, before closing it up. 
We see there are several Louis Vuitton suitcases, he slides this one away next to them, and pulls a tarp over them in the corner and leaves them by some old Christmas decorations.

Marc's little old grandma shuffles about in a house coat with a plate of cookies, as he rushes out.

In the bright light, Marc, Rebecca, Sam, Chloe and Nicki strut down the street with big sunglasses, lattes and shopping bags...just like reality stars. They are have a more jaded attitude now.

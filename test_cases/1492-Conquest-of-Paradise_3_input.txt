CLERK Don't Moxica!  You can't... 
CUT TO: 
GIACOMO and the CLERK running to the scene. 
CUT TO: 
MOXICA (to the clerk) I can't?  I can't? 
With a single swift action, MOXICA draws his sword and cuts off the INDIAN'S hands. 
ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE.  The INDIANS flee, disappearing into the jungle.  GIACOMO arrives at this moment.  He stares at the dismembered hands in horror. 
INT.  GOVERNOR'S MANSION - EVENING 
A tribunal.  Sitting behind a table with his brothers, and flanked by his council, COLUMBUS presides.  MOXICA stands before them. 
COLUMBUS In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery! 
MOXICA (casually) Savagery is what monkeys understand. 
COLUMBUS You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say? 
MOXICA (with exquisite insolence) You will regret this. 
He strolls to the GUARDS at the back of the room. 
EXT.  BARRACKS - NIGHT 
Everything is quiet on the mine site. 
On the terrace, TWO SOLDIERS are drinking in turn, and cracking jokes.  One of them leans against the wooden wall.  He laughs as he hears repeated banging behind him. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  BARRACKS - NIGHT 
A THIRD SOLDIER is fucking an INDIAN WOMAN against the wall. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  BARRACKS - NIGHT 
On the terrace, his two COMPANIONS laugh and encourage his efforts. 
A whooshing sound.  An arrow embeds itself in the chest of the SOLDIER who was leaning against the wall.  He is nailed to the wood behind him. 
THE OTHER SOLDIER stares at him, transfixed, until an arrow pierces his throat.  He collapses, unable to cry out for help. 
INT.  BARRACKS - NIGHT 
FOUR INDIANS in full warrior outfit, their faces painted, burst into the room.  Still busy with the WOMAN, his eyes facing the wall, the SOLDIER believes the intruders to be his friends. 
SOLDIER (without stopping) You animals!  Can't you wait! 
Discovering the FOUR TERRIFYING FIGURES staring at her, the INDIAN WOMAN starts screaming and pushes back the SOLDIER.  He turns around, jumps off the WOMAN, and starts to scramble to the front door, trying to put on his trousers. 
THE FOUR INDIANS catch him, and force him to lay on the ground.  THE MAN struggles, his eyes rolling in terror. TWO INDIANS force his mouth open.  A THIRD ONE kneels and starts stuffing it with gold dust.  THE SOLDIER chokes and suffocates. 
THE WOMAN still stands half naked against the wall, terrified.  AN INDIAN takes his knife from his leggings, slowly.  She starts sobbing and imploring in her language. THE INDIAN slowly walks to her, and plants the knife in the lower part of her belly. 
EXT.  MINE - DAY 
PAIRS of bloody red legs hanging still, high in the air. 
Pulling back, we discover: 
A DOZEN SPANIARDS have been crucified on the scaffolding of the excavations.  Some hands and noses have been removed. 
UTAPAN is standing, uncomfortable among the SPANIARDS. 
A SOLDIER removes a huge iron nail from a wrist.  One of the CRUCIFIED BODIES is gently laid on the ground.  He is still alive -- not for long. 
COLUMBUS and BARTOLOME are silent with rage. 
BARTOLOME (aggressively) Moxica is right.  Our ways don't work! 
BARTOLOME turns to UTAPAN.

BONNIE Don't go yet, Mama. 
UNCLE'S VOICE (cutting in) C'mere, c'mere you little corn roller. 
Wide angle.  As Uncle sweeps up the laughing little Tom. 
Reaction--BONNIE.  BONNIE turns with increased urgency to her MOTHER, who, having been hefted to her feet by BONNIE's sister, has turned to CLYDE, who gives her a big, boyish hug. 
MOTHER ...you know, Clyde, I read about y'all in the papers and I'm jes' scared. 
BONNIE (to Clyde) Sugar, make mama stay a while yet. 
CLYDE (ignoring Bonnie, as does Mother, ebulliently, even joshing) Now Mrs. Parker, don't y'all believe what you read in the papers! That's the law talking there.  They want us to look big so's they'll look big when they catch us. 
He knows he's stumbled onto the wrong thing, but he bounces right along--it's his style. 
CLYDE --and they can't do that.  Why, I'm even better at runnin' than robbin' banks--aw shoot, if we done half the stuff they said we did, we'd be millionaires, wouldn't we, old sugar. (MORE) 
CLYDE (CONT'D) (he turns to Bonnie who continues to stare at her Mother) And I wouldn't risk Bonnie here just to make money, uncertain as times are.  Why one time I knowed of a job where we could of make $2000 easy, but I saw the law outside and I said to myself, why Bonnie could get hurt here.  So I just drove right on and let that money lay. 
He waits for a response, as does BONNIE.  BONNIE's MOTHER smiles, a little abstractedly. 
MOTHER ...Maybe you know the way with her, then.  I'm just an old woman and I don't know nothin... 
She trails off, looking nowhere in particular.  CLYDE takes her reaction to mean that he's overwhelming her with his confidence, and continues to pour it on. 
CLYDE We'll be quittin' this just as soon as the hard times is over, Mother Parker, I can tell you that.  Why me and Bonnie were just talkin' the other day and we talked about when we'd settle down and get us a home, and Bonnie said, "I couldn't bear to live morn'n three miles from my precious mother." Now how'd you like that, Mother Parker? 
BONNIE's MOTHER has undergone a funny sort of transformation during CLYDE's speech--as if something had suddenly come into focus before the old woman's eyes. 
MOTHER Don't believe I would.  I surely don't. (to Bonnie) You try to live three miles from me and you won't live long, honey. (to Clyde) You'd best keep runnin' and you know it, Clyde Barrow. (matter of fact) Bye, baby. 
She hugs BONNIE who can barely respond.  We move in for a closeup of BONNIE as her various relatives, young and old come by to squeeze, kiss and hug her with a chirpy little chorus of Bye, Bonnie!  Bye, Bonnie, bye, bye, bye. 
DISSOLVE: 
EXT. PLATTE CITY MOTEL.  PLATTE CITY, IOWA.  DAY. 
Hold on the outside long enough to see the unusual structures: two little motel cabins connected by two identical garages, an entirely symmetrical structure. 
INT. PLATTE CITY MOTEL BEDROOM.  WITH BONNIE.  DAY. 
--as she tries, against heavy odds, to file and trim her nails in a corner of the room.  The odds are; CLYDE on a uke, b.g., BUCK, and BLANCHE--gathered around C.W. who sits in the only stuffed chair in the room.  Their o.s. raucousness is clearly shattering to BONNIE who, at a key moment in the scene, ends up spearing her cuticle with a file, spurting a little board and a lot of temper. 
Other angle.  CLYDE--BUCK--BLANCHE--C.W.  Day.  A naked lightbulb (the lampshade has been removed) glares down on C.W.'s chest--where a pair of bluebirds have been tattooed with a rocco flourish.  BUCK and BLANCHE are vastly amused-- rather BLANCHE takes delight in BUCK's delight. 
BUCK How long have ya had it? 
C.W. (like some docile animal submitting to inspection) --just got it. 
BUCK (to Blanche, who stares fascinated as one of C.W.'s pectoral muscles contracts and the wings flutter) Touch it, honey!  Go on! 
BLANCHE squeals with amusement.  BUCK takes BLANCHE's hand and places it on the bluebirds. 
BLANCHE (titillated with delight) Oh, no, Daddy!  No! 
Reaction BONNIE.  Day--as the file digs into her cuticle on BLANCHE's squeal.  With barely controlled rage: 
BONNIE What are you all doin'? 
INT. MOTEL BEDROOM.  GROUP SHOT.  FAV. BONNIE.  DAY. 
C.W. (insensitive to Bonnie's stare) Playin' with my tattoo, Bonnie. 
BONNIE Well, why don't you all go play with it somewhere else? 
New angle.  Motel bedroom.  Day. 
BLANCHE What's bothering her? 
CLYDE (sees something coming) Not now, Blanche. 
BUCK (who doesn't want to be victimized by Bonnie's temperament) What's bothering her, Clyde? 
BONNIE (exploding) I said go somewhere else!

SCHREBER Ah, nearly done.  So tell me about your dreams.  I'm very interested. 
White is having a hard time focusing. 
WHITE Just the typical fabrications of a distorted mind.  You know, chased by mysterious men in black, that kind of thing... 
WHITE'S P.O.V.  -  ANGLE ON Schreber with his back turned, at the stove.  THE IMAGE is blurring. 
SCHREBER Ah, our friends in black...  they are not just a figment of your imagination you know, in fact none of what you are experiencing is anything but real. 
Smoke rises thickly around the doctor. 
SCHREBER I know everything about you.  You have no choice but to trust me. 
Flames are shooting up around Schreber from the frying pan. His arms catch fire, and he suddenly spins around clutching flaming daggers in both hands, his whole body engulfed in fire, his face charred, black flesh hanging off his skull. 
SCHREBER Scarey, isn't it? 
White startles awake. 
Schreber stands at the stove looking at White.  Everything is normal. 
SCHREBER Are you feeling alright? 
White stands awkwardly, pulls his coat on. 
SCHREBER What are you doing? 
WHITE I have to go... 
SCHREBER You can't go yet.  We've got so much to talk about... 
Suddenly White feels feint  -  leans against the wall to steady himself. 
SCHREBER You're tired.  You need to lie down. 
ON WHITE  -  swaying. 
WHITE Those pills... 
HIS P.O.V. 
The scene is distorted  -  like looking through water.  Things start SPINNING. 
SCHREBER (echoic) Yes.  A little something to help you relax.  Harmless... 
A tile floor RISES rapidly TOWARDS CAMERA. 
CUT TO: 
GREY LIMBO 
Objects float underwater.  They rise upwards amidst bubbles, break the surface.  A storm at sea  -  dismembered BODY PARTS float all the way to the horizon. 
TWO FOETUSES in separate jars are talking to each other through the glass. 
FOETUS 1 This is madness.  If we're caught... 
FOETUS 2 Shut-up.  Help me with these straps... 
INT.  EXAMINATION ROOM 
WHITE wakes strapped to an exantination table.  SCHREBER and the NURSE loom above him.  The nurse hands Schreber a long, chrome SYRINGE.  The doctor moves towards White. 
SCHREBER (holds syringe up) Now you must relax, Anton. 
A DOOR-BELL RINGS O.S. The nurse makes for the door. 
SCHREBER Leave it! 
He's tapping the side of the syringe, squirting out air bubbles.  THE DOOR-BELL RINGS again  -  very insistent. Schreber looks at the nurse, annoyed. 
SCHREBER Damn!  Whoever it is  -  get rid of them! 
She heads to the door  -  turns back. 
NURSE Keys. 
Schreber puts the syringe down, fumbles in his pocket, pulls out a huge collection of KEYS on a ring, walks to the nurse, hands them to her. 
White manages to wriggle a hand free from the leather strap holding him.  The nurse leaves, the doctor shuts the door, locks it.  He steps over to White. 
SCHREBER I'm sorry I had to put you through this, Anton. (lowers syringe to White's forehead) There will be some pain, but things will be easier this way. 
White lashes out, PUNCHES the doctor in the face.  His glasses go flying, and he falls to the floor, blinded, scrambling for the spectacles. 
A convenient scalpel cuts White from his remaining bonds.  He undoes the last strap around his ankles as the doctor replaces his glasses and leaps at him trying to drive the syringe INTO WHITE'S FOREHEAD. 
The struggle continues  -  each man tries to turn the syringe on the other.  White pushes the doctor, who falls backwards. Schreber leaps onto him, both fall against a tray of medical instruments. 
A loud THUMPING on the examination room door.  White is grabbed from behind, pinned down with the syringe INCHES from his face. 
A CRASH O.S.  Splintering wood.  The door bursts open. 
A ROTUND SILHOUETTE  -  is revealed, clutching a police special, flashing a badge.  A squeaky, over-excited, voice:

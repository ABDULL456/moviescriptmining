AT SHEPHERD'S TABLE 
STEWARDS are clearing away the main course and refilling wine glasses. 
In addition to the two main couples, and ESTHER MacINERNEY and TWO OTHER COUPLES are seated at the President's table. 
SYDNEY Mr. President, the President and Mrs. D'Astier look bored. They're not talking to anybody. 
SHEPHERD They're hammered. Esther, do you speak French? 
ESTHER Latin. 
SHEPHERD I thought you spoke French. 
ESTHER No, Latin. 
SHEPHERD Great, next time Julius Caesar comes to town, you're our gal. Sydney, I don't suppose that you speak any-- 
SYDNEY (taking over-- to D'Astier) Monsieur le President, nous sommes tous habilles, nous avons ce merveilleux orchestre, une piece magnifique...comment se fait-il que les invites ne dansent pas? 
SHEPHERD (proudly to A.J. and Esther) That's my date. 
D'ASTIER Je ne connais pas la tradition en Amerique, mais dans mon pays, si les invites de Louis XVI et Marie Antoinette avaient ose danser devant le roi et la reine, ils auraient perdu la tete. 
SYDNEY Really? 
MADAME D'ASTIER Absolument. 
SHEPHERD Sydney, you didn't dissolve the NATO treaty, did you? 
SYDNEY I just said that we're sitting in this beautiful room, listening to the music of this wonderful orchestra, and I wondered why nobody was dancing. 
D'ASTIER And I informed Ms. Wade that in my country, a guest at the palace of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette would soon find their head in a guillotine if they made the impertinent gesture of dancing without so much as a by-your-leave from the King and the Queen. 
A.J. I'll bet no one accused Louis of being soft on crime. 
SYDNEY There's a lesson there, Mr. President. 
SHEPHERD More beheadings at the White House? 
A.J. Bob Rumson would embrace it. 
SHEPHERD I'm sure he would, but I have a better idea. 
SHEPHERD stands, holds out his hand to SYDNEY. 
SHEPHERD (continuing) Would you like to dance? 
SYDNEY Uh, yeah, I guess. I mean, yes, sir, I'd love to. 
SHEPHERD and SYDNEY move to the dance floor, accompanied by the appreciative "oooh's" and "ahh's" of the GUESTS. 
The dance band begins, and SYDNEY and SHEPHERD dance... 
...beautifully.

THE GUESTS 
each and every one of them, have stopped all conversation and are fixating on this captivating sight. As we go around the room, we can observe the subtle reactions of, at first, various anonymous GUESTS, then

SHEPHERD AND SYDNEY DANCING 
SYDNEY I don't know how you do it. 
SHEPHERD Arthur Murray. Six lessons. 
SYDNEY That's not what I mean. Two hundred pairs of eyes are focused on you right now, with two questions: "Who's this girl, and why's our president dancing with her?" 
SHEPHERD First of all, the 200 pairs of eyes aren't focused on me. They're focused on you. And the answers are "Sydney Ellen Wade" and "Because she said 'yes.'" 
LEWIS AND ROBIN 
looking on from the back of the room. 
LEWIS They make a nice couple. 
ROBIN Lovely. 
LEWIS We've got troubles. 
ROBIN Huge. 
As PEOPLE start onto dance floor, we

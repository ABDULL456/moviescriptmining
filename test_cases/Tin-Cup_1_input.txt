A ball rolls past them and into a hole.   Tin Cup looks over and sees Simms. 
SIMMS Sorry, Roy, can't believe I didn't see you with all that high-priced endorsement crap you're flaunting. 
TIN CUP That's always been your problem, Dave. You don't think about winning; you just want to look good. (turns away to putt) Thing is, this ain't a beauty pageant. (turns back, getting in Simms' face) And it ain't a rain-shortened Quad Cities or a Greater Greensboro you can back into. This is you'n me, pal. This is match-play, and this time you ain't getting no three shots. 
CUT TO: 
125   EXT. FIRST TEE - HIGH ANGLE - DAY                          125 
A large gallery surrounds the tree and lines the fairway as: 
STARTER With the honor in the final pairing, from Salome, Texas, Mr. Roy McAvoy. 
Boisterous applause.   Tin Cup tips his cap and nods at 
David Simms, his pairing in this the final twosome of the final round of the U.S. Open. 
TIN CUP Fairways and greens, Dave... and don't forget to wave as I blow by. 
SIMMS You mean blow up? Like you always do? 
And Tin Cup moves to the tee. 
His hand shakes worse than it did the first day as he tees his ball. Stepping back to line up his shot, he peers down the fairway through a narrow corridor of faces. A daunting sight. He edges over to Romeo and tautly whispers: 
TIN CUP Do me a favor. Bet me a buck I don't put it in the fairway. 
ROMEO I bet you a hundred. 
TIN CUP Okay, good. (going to tee off) Puts things back in perspective. 
CUT TO: 
126   EXT. FIRST HOLE - MINUTE LATER                               126 
Tin Cup looks at his ball, almost invisible in the deep rough. He tries to locate the green beyond the trees that surround him. In golf parlance, he's in jail. He selects a club. 
ROMEO Which way you going? 
Tin Cup points over the trees.   Romeo grimaces.   Tin Cup addresses the shot. Then: 
Tin Cup swings -- the ball flutters weakly out of the rough and disappears into the branches of a bushy tree, dropping eventually next to its trunk, and: 
CUT TO: 
127   LEADER BOARD                                                 127 
A scorer changes the number beside Tin Cup's name from -7 
to -5.   Simms is still -7. 
CUT TO: 
128   EXT. THIRD TEE - DAY                                        128 
Tin Cup arrives on the tee where Simms now has the honor. 
SIMMS Nice double, Roy. 
TIN CUP Just keep making pars, asshole. 
SIMMS I'll take eighteen of 'em. 
TIN CUP And I will own you. 
CUT TO: 
129   EXT. THIRD GREEN - DAY                                      129 
Molly and Doreen stand together behind the big gallery. Molly is using a cardboard periscope to look over the gallery to the green. Doreen is on her tip-toes but all she can see are the backs of heads. 
A swell of cheers builds, then turns to groans. 
MOLLY Oh no, Tin Cup ran it five feet past. (beat) How did he get the name 'Tin Cup'? 
DOREEN (O.S.) He played catcher on the high school baseball team. The star pitcher had this big-league curve, and not all his pitches hit Roy in the mitt. Finally, you gotta respect a man's doggedness. You know? (beat) The team decided Tin Cup sounded better than Clank. 
Molly puts down the periscope at that remark, and hands it to Doreen. 
MOLLY 'Clank''s not a good name for a man... 
Doreen looks through the periscope. 
PERISCOPE'S POV - TIN CUP 
lining up a putt.   She pans over to Romeo helping him. 
DOREEN (V.O.) Tell me something, Molly... have you ever had a Latin lover? 
CUT TO: 
130   EXT. LEADER BOARD                                          130 
The regulars study the board -- the scruffiest lot ever seen at an Open. Next to them stand a group of U.S.G.A. officials, all in neat, matching blazers. The contrast is thrilling. 
CLINT Our boy's in trouble... ya think he's chokin'? 
EARL Our boy don't choke. He fucks up but he don't choke...

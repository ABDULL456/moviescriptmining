Bianca's English teacher perches on the edge of a desk, open book in hand. 
TEACHER Who can tell me at what point Lucentio admits his deception? 
The door of the classroom FLIES open and an angry Kat stalks in, yanking Bianca from her chair and dragging her toward the hallway. 
KAT (to the teacher) Family emergency. 
HALLWAY - DAY 
Bianca tries to pull away as Kat drags her by the hair between two rows of lockers. 
BIANCA Let go! 
KAT You set me up. 
BIANCA I just wanted -- 
KAT What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What? 
BIANCA No! I just wanted 
Miss Perky walks up 
MISS PERKY Ladies?  Shall we take a trip to my office? 
INT. MISS PERKY'S OFFICE - DAY 
Miss Perky stares at both sisters as they sit before her, then focuses on Bianca. 
MISS PERKY So you're the real bitch 
BIANCA Yes!  Okay?  Yes -- I'm the real bitch. I wanted her to get a boyfriend so I could.  Apparently, this makes me a horrible person.  I'm sorry. 
She turns to Kat. 
BIANCA (continuing) I swear -- I didn't know about the money.  I didn't even know Joey was involved.  I would never intentionally hurt you, Kat. 
MISS PERKY (to Kat) Do you care to respond? 
KAT Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it? 
MISS PERKY Just smack her now. 
Bianca rises, taking Kat by the arm. 
BIANCA (to Miss Perky) We'll be getting back to you. 
MISS PERKY What, no hug? 
HALLWAY - DAY 
And Bianca leave Miss Perky's office 
BIANCA Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me? 
KAT It's just you. 
ENGLISH CLASS - DAY 
Mrs. Blaise faces the class 
MRS. BLAISE All right.  I'm assuming everyone found time to compose, their poems. Except for Mr. Dorsey, who's still in ICU. 
Nerds in the back high-five each other. 
MRS. BLAISE (continuing) Would anyone care to read theirs aloud? 
No one moves.  Then Kat slowly stands up. 
KAT I'11 go 
Patrick looks up. 
MRS. BLAISE Oh, Lord. 
She downs a couple Prozac 
MRS. BLAISE (continuing) Please proceed. 
Kat stands, puts on her glasses, and takes a deep breath before reading from her notebook. 
KAT I hate the way you talk to me/ and the way you cut your hair/ I hate the way you drive my car/ I hate it when you stare. 
She pauses, then continues 
KAT (continuing) I hate your big dumb combat boots/ and the way you read my mind/ I hate you so much it makes me sick/ it even makes me rhyme. 
She takes a deep breath, and looks quickly at Patrick, who stares at the floor.

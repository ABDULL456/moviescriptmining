Tarek shakes his head. 
WALTER Did he say anything else? 
TAREK Yeah. Three years ago I was working for some guy who said he was going to sponsor me for my green card but then he turned out to be jerk. But the lawyer said that might allow us to reopen the case. I don't even understand it. 
Walter nods. 
TAREK (CONT'D) Walter, there are guys who have been in here for years! I can't do that Walter. I'll go crazy. 
WALTER He's trying to deal with the case as quickly as possible. 
Tarek goes silent. 
WALTER (CONT'D) Tarek. I have to go back to Connecticut. I'll be reachable by phone if you need me for anything. 
Tarek's mind is racing. He shakes his head. 
TAREK OK. Just please...don't forget about me in here. 
WALTER I won't. 
TAREK Are you still practicing? 
WALTER Yes. 
TAREK You should go back to the drum circle. 
WALTER (Quickly) No. 
Tarek laughs. 
TAREK OK. But listen to that Fela CD. That will help you, I promise. 
WALTER I will. 
TAREK So show me what you've been working on. 
WALTER What? 
TAREK Show me. On that. Come on. I need some music, man. 
Tarek points to the shelf in front of Walter. 
WALTER Now? 
TAREK Don't worry. They can't arrest you. At least not yet. 
WALTER OK. 
Walter looks around and then cradles the phone in his shoulder and starts to bang a simple beat on his counter top. Tarek watches and listens for a moment. 
TAREK Ah. There it is. Good. Good. You are getting better. 
And then he joins in. The two men continue to play together. 
INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - MORNING 
Walter is packing his suitcase. Suddenly there is a knock at his door. He exits the room. 
INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Walter opens the door. Standing there is a strikingly attractive forty-five year-old ARAB WOMAN. She seems startled to see Walter. 
WALTER Hello. 
ARAB WOMAN I'm sorry. I must have the wrong apartment. 
She starts to walk down the hall. 
WALTER Can I help you? 
ARAB WOMAN I'm looking for my son. 
WALTER Are you Tarek's mother? 
ARAB WOMAN Yes. 
WALTER Oh. This is Tarek's apartment. I...share the apartment with him. 
The Arab Woman is cautious.

MITCH You are, aren't you? 
MELANIE Certainly, but... 
MITCH Then it's settled. What time is dinner, Mother? 
LYDIA Seven o'clock, same as usual. 
MITCH I'll pick you up, Miss Daniels. Where are you staying? 
MELANIE With... with Annie, of course. 
MITCH Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter to seven, will that be all right? 
MELANIE Annie... Annie may have made other plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I can find my own way. 
MITCH You're sure now? You won't hire a boat or anything? 
MELANIE I'm sure. 
MITCH Seven o'clock then. 
MELANIE Maybe. 
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH 
grinning. 
MITCH We'll be waiting. How's your head now? 
MED. SHOT - THE GROUP 
Lydia looks at Mitch inquiringly. 
MELANIE (with an overwarm smile) It's nothing, Mrs. Brenner. A gull hit me, that's all. 
Lydia stares at her doubtfully. 
DISSOLVE 
EXT. ANNIE HAYWORTH'S HOUSE - FULL SHOT 
Melanie is standing on the front steps, a paper bag in her hands. She rings the doorbell. The ROOM TO LET sign is still in the window. The door suddenly opens. 
ANNIE (surprised) Oh, hi! (pause) Did you find her all right? 
TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE 
MELANIE Yes, I did. 
There is a long awkward pause. Annie smiles expectantly at Melanie. Melanie seems hesitant. 
MELANIE I was wondering... 
ANNIE Yes? 
MELANIE That sign. (pause) Do you think I could have the room for a single night? 
ANNIE Well, I'd really hope to rent it for... 
MELANIE I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full. 
ANNIE (after a pause) Sure. You can have it. (smiles) Where's your bag? In the car? 
Melanie holds up the paper bag. Annie looks at it and then smiles. 
ANNIE It's utilitarian, I'll say that for it. 
MELANIE (smiling) I just picked up some things for the night at the general store. You see, I hadn't planned on spending much time here. 
ANNIE Yes, I know. Did something unexpected crop up? 
There is a moment where both women look at each other... When Melanie answers, it is abrupt and a trifle cold -- she is again telling Annie to mind her own business. 
MELANIE Yes. (pause) May I use your phone? I'd like to call home. 
There is another moment where Annie appraises Melanie's attitude, and then accepts it. She suddenly smiles warmly. 
ANNIE Why don't you come in then?  I was just about to mix a martini. 
She is about to lead Melanie into the house when they both hear a SOUND overhead. They turn to look skyward. 
LONG SHOT - A FLOCK OF LARGE BIRDS 
flying in beautiful precise formation against the sky. 
TWO SHOT - ANNIE AND MELANIE 
ANNIE (shaking her head) Don't they ever stop migrating? 
But Melanie is watching the sky and the birds with a curiously serious expression. 
DISSOLVE 
LONG SHOT - THE APPROACH ROAD to the Brenner house. Melanie's car is driving along the shore. Behind her, the sky is stained with sunset. There are gulls on the bay, cawing into the silence. 
FULL SHOT - THE CAR 
as it pulls into the Brenner yard. 
MED. SHOT - MELANIE 
reaching up for the rear view mirror, tilting it to examine her lipstick, touching the edge of her mouth with one hand. She gets out of the car, CAMERA FOLLOWING her to the house. She climbs the porch steps, KNOCKS on the door. There is no answer. Puzzled, she begins walking back into the yard. In the distance, she sees Mitch, Lydia and Cathy coming from behind the chicken sheds. She raises her arm in greeting. 
MELANIE (calling) Hi! 
FULL SHOT - MITCH, CATHY, LYDIA 
in the distance. Mitch and Cathy raise their arms. 
CATHY (excitedly) Hi! (she breaks into a trot toward Melanie) 
CLOSE SHOT - CATHY as she approaches. She is an eleven-year- old child, clear-eyed, bright, uninhibited, wearing a shirt and blouse, her hair cropped close to her head. She hesitates for just a moment. 
CATHY Miss Daniels? 
MELANIE Yes? 
And Cathy flings herself into Melanie's arms, almost knocking her off her feet, hugging her fiercely. 
CATHY They're beautiful! They're just what I wanted! Is there a man and a woman? I can't tell which is which. 
MELANIE Well, I suppose... 
FULL SHOT - ALL OF THEM 
MITCH (coming up) Hi. Annie had no plans, huh? I'm glad you came. Are you hungry? 
MELANIE Famished. 
MITCH Dinner's just about ready. (explaining) We were out back looking at the chickens. Something seems to be wrong with them. 
LYDIA (going toward house) There's nothing wrong with those chickens, Mitch. I'm going to call Fred Brinkmeyer right now.

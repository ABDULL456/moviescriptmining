{"train": "SEMI PRO \nWritten by \nScot Armstrong \nJune 2006 \nFADE IN: \nEXT. THE STAPLES CENTER - PRESENT DAY \nWe hear the faint sounds of a crowd cheering on Kobe Bryant. The real Bob Costas does narration. \nBOB COSTAS (V.0.) Before the NBA was the NBA, there was another basketball league in America... DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: This is real ABA footage. A series of great plays are made by ABA stars. \nBOB COSTAS (V.0.) .From 1967 to 1976, there was the American Basketball Association. A maverick minor-league that would change the game forever. The ABA made the fast break FAST... Invented the three point shot... And introduced the world to something called the Slam Dunk Contest. DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: Dr. J launches from the foul line and dunks in the world's first dunk contest. David Thompson finishes an Alley Oop. \nBOB COSTAS (V.0.) Singer Pat Boone owned the Oakland Oaks. Wilt Chambelain coached the Conquistadors. I myself was the young voice of the St. Louis Spirits. DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: A young Bob Costas broadcasts from St. Louis, looking pretty sweet in side burns and a tweed jacket. \nBOB COSTAS (V.O.) Players like Dr. J, Ice-man George Gervin and Moses Malone were as entertaining as they come. But despite the league's flair, convincing fans to show up for games was often a struggle. DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: The infamous TV interview where Freddy Lewis wins a 'race horse.' Footage of 'Dime Beer Night.' Footage of the Kentucky Colonials fielding a cheerleader as one of their starting five. \nBOB COSTAS (V.0. ) For owners, promotional ideas became an art form all to themselves. DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: The Miami Ball Girls dance in bikinis (In truth, some of the girls were still in high school). \nBOB COSTAS (V.0.) One night, the Nets went as far as to give a free gerbil to it's first fifty fans... There were plenty of punches too, giving the National Hockey League a run for it's money. DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: A guy elbows Connie Hawkins, who turns and punches the guy in the face. \nBOB COSTAS (V.0.) Yes, the ABA had a style all it's own. The hair was big, the shorts were short and the ball was red, white and blue. DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: Harry 'The fat Mexican guy' dances. \nBOB COSTAS (V.0.) In 1976, rumors of a merger spread throughout the league. In the end, only four teams would join the NBA and survive. \nQUICK CUTS: THE PACERS. THE NUGGETS. THE NETS. THE SPURS. \nBOB COSTAS (V.0.) Teams like the Kentucky Colonels and the Virginia Squires would disappear forever. But their spirit still lives on to this day. \nEXT. A BASKETBALL STADIUM - 1976 \nWe hear a crowd going crazy. \nBOB COSTAS (V.0.) Here, we present the legend of the ABA... Exactly as it happened. Some FUNKY MUSIC plays. \nBOB COSTAS (V_O_) Except, this Flint Michigan team never existed. \n(BEAT) And, well, everything in this movie is completely fake. \nINT. AMIGO STADIUM - DAY \nTITLE CARD: ANAHEIM AMIGO STADIUM, 1976. CLOSE ON: A logo of a basketball with a sombrero on it. \n\"LET'S GO AMIGOS!\" Welcome to the American Basketball Association. A fan chugs his beer and throws some guacamole. The crowd screams and curses at MONIX, mid 40'S -- talented, but past his prime. (There are three leading characters in this movie. This is the old rock. Think Nolte in 48 hours. Cosner in Durham. Newman in Slap Shot). \nLIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) The Amigos are up by one here. They'll need to find a way to stop Monix. He checks the clock, waits... And now drives the lane... MONIX suddenly takes a HUGE HIT, TOTALLY SLAMMED by a big asshole, PETRELLI. He flies into the crowd -- everyone erupts, screaming with glee. \nLIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) Ooh, Monix gets taken out hard. Some tough love from Patrelli. \nLOU REDWOOD (V.0.) WHAT!? Where's the foul on that? That was all ball. (covering mic, screaming) Jesus Christ Leonard! Let them play for once! This ain't fuckin' Greenpeace! \nLIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) Some might say that was a close call, but these referees have done a nice job tonight. \nLOU REDWOOD (V.0.) 'Oh please. These refs SUCK. Still stuck in the crowd. Monix struggles to get back on the court. The crowd shoves him around, twisting his ankle, slapping him. The crowd is nuts. \nDRUNK LADY Hey Monix, want a sip? Monix is confused, until the woman throws the beer in his face. \nDRUNK LADY (smart ass) Oops. She and her friends laugh. Monix says nothing. Instead, he holds his aching back and limps up to the foul line, annoyed. \nPATRELLI \n(SMILING) Sorry, Monix, I got pushed. \nLIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) Well, it looks like the Amigos are in trouble here. Monix is a ninety percent shooter, if he can hit both of these free throws, it's over. Monix performs his ancient free throw ritual: Three dribbles and a quick spin of the ball. But he MISSES. \nDRUNK LADY \nHA. NICE SHOT MONIX! YOU FUCKIN' \nSUCK, MAN! YOU SUCK DONKEY DICK. Again, Monix ignores the drunk lady. \nLIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) They dodged a bullet there. But Monix still has one last chance to tie it up. Monix focuses on his ritual again. \nJackie dribbles hard to the hoop, tossing up a high arcing baby hook. AIRBALL. \nLIVE ABA RADIO (V.0. ) Airball. \nLOU REDWOOD (V.0. ) Yep, a Polish swish. \nLIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) Scootsie Double-Day gets the offensive rebound and Jackie calls for it again, trying to establish the low post early. Jackie holds the ball, preparing for another 'Tear Drop from Hades'... But now he suddenly gets distracted by something up in the stands. \nJACKIE MOON (into the stands) \nHEY! RAVI! WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU \nDOING, MAN? IN THE STANDS: A Pakistani vendor, RAVI, IS POURING CHEESE ON \nSOME NACHOS. \nRAVI What? \nJACKIE MOON Enough with the cheese already. More chips, less cheese, how many times do I have to tell you? WHISTLE! Jackie's been walking with the ball. FATHER PAT THE REF wears a holy collar with pin strips over it. \nFATHER PAT THE. REF Traveling. \nJACKIE MOON Traveling!?... On who? \nFATHER PAT THE REF On you. \nJACKIE MOON That's bullshit, Father Pat! Jackie, furious, SLAMS THE BALL down on the floor. \nLIVE ABA RADIO (V.0. ) Jackie Moon. The most passionate man in sports. \nEXT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - MEANWHILE \nSome hot girls in shorts hold up a sign that says 'ALL STAR PARKING.' Ms. Quincy's BBQ delivery truck rips into the lot. Clarence skids to a stop. \nINT. FLINT MICHIGAN FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - CONTINUOUS \nThe crowd looks off camera and suddenly erupts. CLARENCE enters out of the tunnel, he takes a bite of a Hershey bar, then gestures to the crowd, giving the international symbol for 'Let's get funky.' \nBOBBY DEE (V.0.) Ladies and gentleman, put your hands together for Downtown Funky- Stuff Malone! Clarence tosses the half eaten candy bar, wipes his hands off on his jersey and jogs right out onto the court during the game, TAGGING HIS TEAMMATE OUT as if it were pick up. \nLIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) Downtown, wastes no time entering the game -- tagging out Vakidis Roscovenski. \n.CLAWS COACH (to the ref) C'mon Father Pat, he's got to check into the game doesn't he? The ref just shrugs. Downtown calls for the ball and gets it. \nLIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) Downtown dribbles left, then right a little shake and bake through the legs -- double teamed now, he's got Twiggy Munson open under the basket. Downtown, still with the ball, dribbles behind his back, they triple him, he's got Munson and Ellis wide open under the hoop, but look at these moves! The entire other team leaves their men and guards Clarence five on one, but Clarence never passes. His four teammates watch from under the basket. \nDespite his selfish attitude, it's clear Clarence actually has some serious talent. \nLIVE ABA RADIO (V.0. ) Downtown has all five guys on him -- He sprints to the corner and forces up a fade away three... YES! Wow. You think this league's going bankrupt? Well, think again. \nLOU REDWOOD (V.0.) People call him selfish. I call him the greatest show in shorts. \nINT. LOCKER ROOM - HALF TIME \nCLOSE ON: An old-timey photo of a man with a handle-bar moustache. It's been autographed by the inventor of basketball: 'Go Tropics! -James Naismith' The team enters the locker room happy, even though they're losing badly at half time. \nJACKIE MOON Yes! Nice first half guys! That's what I call Flint Tropic's basketball! \n(BEAT) I've been telling you all season, we're about to make a run. Flint Michigan is destined for greatness. (at the chalkboard) Twiggy, enough with the bounce passes, let's show some zip. Bee Bee, try not to get fouled so much, free throws take too long. Scootsie, what did I tell you about catching with two hands.? God gave you one hand for a reason: To look awesome. Jackie points to the chalkboard. Where one of his catchy slogans is spelled out. \nJACKIE MOON Let's stay focused on the four \n'D'S' (pointing to the board) Dangerous, Dangerous, Dangerous, Dunks. Remember: This isn't just a basketball team. It's a lifestyle. \nEveryone claps. Meanwhile, Clarence grabs a bunch of hair products and goes to work. But he notices something. \nCLARENCE Yo, Jackie, is the washing machine broken? ANGLE ON: A few workers are taking out the washing machine. \nJACKIE MOON Listen up guys: I've got some good news and I've got some bad news. The good news is, we're getting rid of that piece of shit washing machine. The bad news is, everyone does their laundry at home from now on. Towels too. Everyone complains. Boo etc. Jackie turns to BOBBY DEE a 'front office' guy. \nJACKIE MOON And Bobby Dee, I need you to clean out your desk. \nBOBBY DEE No. I have kids. \nJACKIE MOON You're not fired. I sold your desk. \nBOBBY DEE Oh. \nLOOK AT THE SIZE OF THIS THING! \nLET'S HEAR IT FOR DUKES! \nINT. LYNN'S HOUSE - MEANWHILE \nA beautiful, down to earth woman, LYNN, 30's, is reading a book. In the background, her boyfriend, KYLE, is listening to the Tropics game on the RADIO. \nLIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) Monix was an All-American at Michigan State, but then went on to a disappointing journeyman career in the NBA. But he did manage to sit on the bench with the world champion Boston Celtics years ago and won a ring. \nLOU REDWOOD (V.0. ) (on radio) I should hire his agent. Kyle listens to this and yells to the other room. \nKYLE Hey honey, guess who got traded to Flint? \nLYNN I don't know, who? \nKYLE Monix. The word Monix stops her in her tracks. \nLYNN Monix? \nKYLE Yeah! He's already got an NBA ring, but he's still playing... In Flint. Can you believe it? \nLYNN No, I can't. Lynn closes her book, fidgety... \nKYLE They say he asked to be traded. Who the Hell leaves California to come here? I love this guy. \nMUSIC CUE: THE BROTHERS JOHNSON 'GET THE FUNK OUTTA MY FACE.' \nEXT./INT. JACKIE'S MONTE CARLO - NIGHT \nJackie cruises the streets of Flint in a pimped out Monte Carlo. He's got chrome rims and a gold grill. The interior is wall to wall carpeting. He swigs a beer as he turns. \nJACKIE MOON (singing with car stereo) Get the funk outta-of-my-face... A SIGN SAYS: THE KREMLIN. Jackie rolls up and parks in a reserved parking space. He rolls up the windows and locks the doors by hand and exits. \nREVEAL: JACKIE HAS GIANT ICE PACKS TAPED TO HIS KNEES, Patrick Ewing style, right over his slacks. A police officer drinks, in uniform, outside. \nCOP What's up Jackie? \nJACKIE MOON Not much. \nCOP (re: the big ice packs) Your knees okay? \nJACKIE MOON Oh yeah. Just icing them down. \nINT. THE KREMLIN - NIGHT \n'The Kremlin' is rocking. The beer is served in cans only. \nBALL GIRL MAGGIE (O.S.) Hey Jackie! \nJACKIE MOON Well look at you! You look beautiful. What's different? \nBALL GIRL MAGGIE I dyed my hair. \nJACKIE MOON No, that's not it... Did your tits get bigger? \nBALL GIRL MAGGIE No. \nJACKIE MOON Don't lie to me. Those things got bigger. \nBALL GIRL MAGGIE No, they're the same. \nJACKIE MOON Well, good job. Jackie keeps walking, bumping into MS. QUINCY, Clarence's mother. \nMS. QUINCY Yo Jackie. You know, that wife of yours has been making out with that Mark Spitz lookin' motherfucker all night. She gestures to a guy who's lip-locked with Jackie's wife. LUCY MOON unbuttons her fur coat. \nJACKIE MOON Oh. It's okay, Lucy and I've got an open relationship. \nMS. QUINCY I know that. But he's about to suck on her Damn tits, right here in front of all these people. \nJACKIE MOON She's hot right? What can I say, we're freedom lovers. (calling off to his wife) Hey honey! Lucy Moon ignores him, only making out harder. \nJACKIE MOON (to his wife) Right on! (to Quincy) I'm not jealous. It's a sweet deal for both of us. \nMS. QUINCY Have you ever slept with another woman? \nJACKIE MOON I could. That's the beauty of it. No ball and chain here. \nTEAM, BUT I LIKE IT. One of the party people, a ball girl, GAYLE, interrupts. \nGAYLE Excuse me boys. You mind, if I borrow your friend for a minute? \nINT. DANCE FLOOR - MEANWHILE \nJackie is dancing to his own song, still wearing the ice packs on his knees. The song ends and A DIFFERENT ONE STARTS. \nJACKIE MOON (looking to the DJ) Hold on a second. \nMELINDA What's wrong? \nJACKIE MOON Where's the boogie? Jackie fights his way through the crowd to the DJ booth. \nJACKIE MOON (to DJ, over music) \nHEY! WHERE'S THE BOOGIE? \nDJ \nI ALREADY PLAYED YOUR SONG FOUR \nTIMES. \nJACKIE MOON \nGET UP. \nDJ \nNO. YOU CAN'T KEEP DOING THIS, \nJACKIE. I'M THE DJ. \nJACKIE MOON (taking over as DJ) \nNOT ANY MORE. YOU'RE ON SNACK \nPATROL. SCREECH -- The music stops. \nJACKIE MOON (into the mic) The year was 1973. A young musician named Jackie Moon, finishes years of musical training, only to find he is a slave to the notes on the page. He knows it's time to break free. In a sudden fit of creative mastery, he grabs a pen and a napkin and writes a song that breaks all the rules. Ladies and gentleman... Let's get sweaty. MUSIC CUE: Jackie's song. Everyone goes crazy. \nJACKIE MOON (V.0.) (studio version) Baby, who wants to; love me sexy. baby, are you ready to; lick me sexy. Take off your shoes and; suck me sexy. Baby, we're naked and we're; humping sexy-- \nINT. DAIQUIRI ROOM - NIGHT \nGayle and Monix walk upstairs into the 'coolest' room ever. Carpet on the ceiling, a plaid couch, a fish tank, a water bed, mirrors, etc. \nGAYLE I'm glad they traded for you, I got myself a cute one. \nMONIX So, this is the Daiquiri room? \nLUCY MOON (O.S. ) That's right. REVEAL: LUCY MOON, Jackie's wife, is on the couch. She's the hottest girl in the world. \nLUCY MOON What do you think, Gayle? Does he like it with my boots on, or does he like my boots off? \nGAYLE He seems like a boots on kind of guy. \nLUCY MOON Then it looks like I'm ready. As soon as you slide these shorts off of me. \nMONIX Aren't you Jackie's wife? \nLUCY MOON He knows about the Daiquiri room. \nGAYLE It's a new tradition we're starting, when new players join. \nMONIX I see. Well, I'm going to have to pass. I'm good, thanks. \nLUCY MOON Honey, you don't know what good is. With that, Lucy flicks on the stereo-- \nMUSIC CUE: THE BAR KEYS 'TOO HOT TO STOP.' \nMONIX Listen um... (i.e. what's your name?) \nGAYLE My name is 'no strings attached.' \nLUCY MOON You can call me Mrs. Moon. Gayle and Lucy perform a funky/seductive dance, moving closer and closer to Monix. \nLYNN You want a favor? \nMONIX My knee. \nLYNN Oh, Jesus Christ Monix. It's 4 a.m. Lynn stares at him in disbelief. Monix shrugs. \nMONIX No one here can drain it right. \nLYNN Fine. Monix nods, then makes a move toward the door. \nLYNN No. You're not coming in. We'll do it in the yard. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. JACKIE'S MONTE CARLO - DAYS LATER \nJackie drives in his car, practicing for the meeting. tries to build some confidence. \nJACKIE MOON (into the rear view, very \nCIVILIZED) Well, hello Commissioner -- Why sure, I would love one of your Puerto Rican cigars -- Oh, I know I'm a legitimate owner, you don't have to tell me that -- We're merging with the NBA? Oh, that's nice -- Ha Ha Ha! Good one, Commish ... \nEXT. INDIANAPOLIS - CONTINUOUS \nA brick building on the outskirts of Indianapolis. A sign says. WELCOME ABA OWNERS. Jackie pulls into the lot and parks. He looks in the mirror one last time. \nJACKIE MOON Your Mom would be proud of you today. \nINT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nNot-quite-Rich guys surround a large oak table. JACKIE is by far the youngest of the owners. \nCOMMISH .I'm sure each of you have heard the rumors. And I'm here to tell you, the rumors are true. The ABA will be merging with the NBA at the end of this season. \nJACKIE MOON \nYES!!! (to an old guy) \nGIVE ME TEN, NORTON! YES!! (fists to the ceiling) \nEVERYONE CAN EAT SHIT! I AM THE \nGREATEST MAN IN THE WORLD! \nCOMMISH Our league is sold. And the NBA agreed to all of our financial demands! Now Jackie turns inward, more quietly intense. This is, without question, the greatest moment of his life. \nJACKIE MOON (to himself) You're a real owner. You're in the \nNBA. \nCOMMISH Four of our teams will be absorbed into the NBA family, the rest of you will terminate operations. \nJACKIE MOON Exactly! You know it! (now hearing) I'm sorry, wait, what? \nCOMMISH The Nuggets, The Nets, The Spurs and the Pacers will play in the NBA next year. The rest of us will dissolve. \nJACKIE MOON Dissolve? Dissolve, like, how? How do I dissolve into the NBA? The winning owners look at each other, not sure how to handle Jackie. \nJACKIE MOON What's happening? \nCOMMISH I'm sorry Jackie. We all know how. emotional you get. We waited until the very last second to tell you. Jackie pounds the table. \nJACKIE MOON No. NO! NO!!! He kicks over his chair... \nTHE COMMISH We know you're upset, Jackie. But you'll be very well compensated. \nLOSING OWNER #1 Everyone's agreed to a very large sum. \nJACKIE MOON I don't want a sum! I want my team! (to the losing owners) C'mon you guys, you're not going to just sit here and take the money, are you? They are. \nJACKIE MOON (to winning owners) What do the Spurs have that we don't? \nTHE COMMISH A huge fan base. A brand new stadium. A solid economic growth package, including strong tax incentives. \nJACKIE MOON Oh, c'mon, that's BULLSHIT! \nCOMMISH The NBA is taking four teams, Jackie, there's nothing I can do. Jackie goes quiet, thinking... An epic idea hits him. \nJackie and Dukes are next to the bus, discussing the check. \nDUKES I tried Jackie. They won't take it. They said it's 'symbolic.' \nJACKIE MOON What does symbolic mean? \nDUKES I don't know. But they said I need a real check. \nJACKIE MOON I don't know what your bank is talking about. That is a real check. I signed it myself. \nDUKES It's written in glitter, dude. Can't you just give me, like, a regular sized one? \nJACKIE MOON I don't get it. People are usually able to cash these. Maybe you should try another bank. (trying to wrap it up) If you run into any more trouble, let me know. \nDUKES Okay Jackie, thanks man. \nJACKIE MOON Any time, congratulations. Jackie turns away from Dukes and exhales, walking back to the bus. \nMUSIC CUE: 'SHORT PEOPLE' BY RANDY NEWMAN. \nEXT. THE HIGHWAY - DAY \nWe're flying down the highway. \nINT. THE JET - DAY \nKong, the small Asian player, is driving, singing along with Jackie to the radio... \nJACKIE MOON & KONG (singing Randy Newman) \nSHORT PEOPLE GOT, NO REASON... \nSHORT PEOPLE GOT, NO REASON... \nSHORT PEOPLE GOT, NO REASON TO LIVE Jackie reaches up into a special bin and takes out some beef jerky, then yells out the window. \nJACKIE (out the window at a car) \nYOU IN-THE-GREEN-CAR GOT, NO REASON \nTO LIVE... Pan back to see the whole team crammed into tiny seats. Vakidis has his knees pointing straight toward the ceiling. Twiggy Munson is reading '70's pornography. Clarence is sewing a new name onto his jersey. The rest of the guys are eating their hot dish. \nMONIX So, Clarence, what's in this 'hot dish' anyway? \nCLARENCE My Mom cooked your ass a whole Damn meal, why you gotta go asking what's in it? \nMONIX It's a compliment. It's good. \nCLARENCE If it's good, then it's good. Why do you gotta know what's in it? What's in hot dish? Hot dish is in hot dish, asshole. BEE BEE and SCOOTSIE look over the seat, facing them. \nBEE BEE ELLIS Hey Monix, what were the Celtics like? \nMONIX They were fast. \nSCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY Fast? No one's faster than me. I should be on the Celtics. \nMONIX (pointing to his mind) Fast up here. \nBEE BEE ELLIS You're supposed to be Mr. Smartball. Why'd you get bounced? \nMONIX Well, you have to be able to jump too. \nSCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY Hey, let us see that ring again. \nMONIX Not right now, okay Twiggy? \nCLARENCE Isn't it a little embarrassing wearing that thing everyday? \nMONIX Embarrassing? \nCLARENCE You call yourself a Celtic? You sat through every single playoff game. You didn't see action once. And now you walk around wearing the ice like you're Bill Russel. Well you ain't. \nBEE BEE ELLIS Oh, you're just jealous. \nSCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY Yeah, Monix played solid minutes, for lots of teams. He's played in the NBA, that's more than you can say. \nCLARENCE Whatever. At least I never sat on the bench and then called myself a champion. You didn't do shit for that Celtic team. If I was Dave Cowens, I'd yank that ring right off your neck. That was a pretty heated exchange. Monix looks like he's got something to say, but he doesn't. Clarence has the last word. \nTwo twin beds in a crap-box motel room. Monix has the phone to his ear, but it just keeps ringing. He'd leave a message for Lynn, but answering machines haven't been invented yet. He hangs up, looks in the mirror, and now takes his Championship ring necklace off. He looks at the ring in his hand... And shoves it into his duffle bag. \nCLARENCE (O.S.) I brought us some ice. Monix is startled. Clarence, his roommate for the night, enters. \nMONIX Ice? What for? \nCLARENCE I don't know, it's free. Clarence takes some ice, pops it in his mouth and starts crunching. \nCLARENCE Want some? \nMONIX No thanks. Now BEE BEE enters, yet another player in the small room. \nBEE BEE ELLIS That Root Beer machine took my fucking change, man. White people are assholes. Monix ignores this. Laying back, he focuses on the TV: THE CELTICS are playing. Their trapping defense is a thing of beauty. Clarence walks over and flicks the channels, until he stops at 'Love American Style.' \nMONIX You turned off the Celtics? \nCLARENCE I don't watch people play basketball. They watch me. With that, Clarence pulls out a JOINT and lights it. \nMONIX (re: the marijuana) What the Hell is that? \nCLARENCE (as he inhales) It's a fucking Egg-McMuffin. Monix opens the window, clearing the pot smoke out of his face. JACKIE EXITS the bathroom, having just taken a shower. He's wearing a very small robe. This is now the fourth player who's sleeping in this tiny room. \nMONIX Why don't you shower in your room? \nJACKIE MOON My wife is using it. I'll be crashing with you guys tonight. \n(NOTICING) Ice? Awesome. (as he eats ice, re: TV) Love American Style? Turn it up. \nJackie doesn't say a word about the pot. Instead he keeps his eyes glued to the TV, then reaches for the joint and SMOKES \nIT. \nMONIX Jackie, have you ever even slept with your wife? \nJACKIE MOON \n(LYING) What? Are you kidding? Try, like, every weekend. She's so hot. \nMONIX Sounds like a great arrangement. \nJACKIE MOON You guys need to wake up. Quit living like it's the 1950's, man. Live it up. (showing off) Hey Clarence, let's have some of that smoke, bro. \nMONIX I'm pretty sure we have a game tomorrow. \nJACKIE MOON (as he inhales) This stuff won't affect you. It's premium. Jackie finishes inhaling, then holds it out for Monix. He stares at the joint, then around the room at his teammates. \nMONIX Well, if this is really going to be my life, I might as well be stoned like everyone else. \nJACKIE MOON Well said. Monix takes the stupid joint. The instant Monix inhales he \nCOUGHS LIKE CRAZY. \nMONIX What the Hell is this? \nCLARENCE What do you mean? \nMONIX It's harsh. \nCLARENCE Take that back. \nMONIX Take what back? \nJACKIE MOON His Mom grows it. \nCLARENCE Yeah, in the yard. \nMONIX Your Mom grew this? \nCLARENCE It's sweet grass. \nMONIX Well, I'm finished, thanks. \nCLARENCE What's wrong, my Mom's weed ain't good enough for you? \nMONIX I guess not. \nJACKIE MOON C'mon man, have some respect for his Mom's weed. \nMONIX What about commercials? \nJACKIE MOON What? \nMONIX Commercials, what about commercials? Jackie thinks about this, then nods 'good idea.' \nJACKIE MOON I like it. Time out Ref! \nANNOUNCER (V.0. ) A time out on the floor, 5:20 left before the half, the Amigos 45, the Tropics 19, we'll be right back after this message from Shasta. The camera's on air' red light turns off. \nCAMERA MAN (rooting them on) And... You're clear. \nJACKIE MOON \nSOMEBODY HIT SOMEBODY! \nBAM! MONIX CLOCKS PETRELLI. \nBAM! JACKIE MOON PUNCHES ANOTHER GUY. \nPETRELLI TAKES THE HIT AND TACKLES MONIX. \nBOTH BENCHES CLEAR. THE CROWD GOES NUTS. \nINT. THE COMMISSIONER'S HOUSE - MEANWHILE \nThe commissioner relaxes at home with his two kids... A Shasta commercial is on TV. \nSHASTA COMMERCIAL (V.0.) (on TV) I want a pop... I want a -- Shasta... \nINT. AMIGO STADIUM - CONTINUOUS \nMAYHEM. JACKIE MOON IS YANKING A FAN'S HAIR. \nA TALL GUY IS ABOUT TO POUND SHORT LITTLE KONG. BUT NOW KONG \nJUMPS IN THE AIR AND DOES A SWEET ROUND-HOUSE JUDO KICK, \nKNOCKING THE TALL GUY TO THE FLOOR. \nKONG Hi-Ya! \nMEANWHILE: MONIX AND PETRELLI ARE TRADING HOCKEY PUNCHES... \nCAMERA MAN And we're back in -5- (Monix punches Petrelli) \n(Petrelli punches Monix) \n(Monix punches Petrelli) \n(Monix ducks and punches) (cuing the announcers) \nAND WE'RE ON. \nTHE 'RED LIGHT' GLOWS. \nON A DIME: EVERYONE STOPS PUNCHING, STANDS UP STRAIGHT AND \nSMILES. \nANNOUNCER (V.0.) Welcome back to the ABA game of the week... Players hold their heads in pain. Others limp back to the bench. \nANNOUNCER (V.0.) .The camaraderie and spirit of this league is on full display here tonight... Off camera, Monix delivers a secret punch to Patrelli's spleen. \nINT. LOCKER ROOM - HALF TIME \nJackie runs the half time talk, standing in front of the chalk board. \nJACKIE MOON Okay, solid first half guys, but we're going to have to make some \nADJ-- Monix interrupts Jackie, pissed. He addresses the team, stepping in front of Jackie Moon. \nMONIX --This is bullshit guys. They're kicking our ass in basketball and they're kicking our ass during the commercials, too. Does anybody here understand the concept of the pick and roll? Because they're going to keep double teaming at the top of the key until somebody rotates the Damn ball... \nJACKIE MOON Yeah! C'mon guys! Rotate the ball. Monix looks at this group and gets even madder. \nMONIX Does anyone in this room have any pride? Don't you realize, this is thelast four weeks of basketball anyus are ever going to play?Is thishow we're really going togo out?You'd think we'd want toend ourcareers battling, hustling after every loose ball. Boxing out under the boards. Setting picks for our teammates. But we haven't done shit out there. Twiggy Munson and Scootsie Double-Day hang their heads. \nCLARENCE (to the bartender) Johnny for short. (to Brian, re: Monix) Two coffees. \nMONIX So, what brings you to the The Kremlin? \nCLARENCE Listen, I know you and I haven't always been the best of buddies. \nBut I've been thinking about what you said the other night. This is gonna be our last chance. If I'm ever going to get into the NBA, it's going to be with the Tropics. \nMONIX I hate to break it to you, Clarence, but the Tropics will never play in the NBA. \nCLARENCE So maybe we won't. But like you said, I don't want to look back on this with any regrets. I know what you think of me. But I'm willing to put our differences aside. I'm telling you right now, I'll do whatever it takes to win. \nMONIX You mean, like, pass? \nCLARENCE (with a smile) I would consider passing, yes. \nMONIX Sorry kid. Even if I wanted to play harder, this knee won't let me. \nCLARENCE I'm not just talking about you playing point guard... I'm talking about you teaching us... Monix could not be less interested. \nCLARENCE Monix, you know more about basketball than any man who's ever set foot in Flint. Monix drinks, not into it... \nCLARENCE All I'm saying is, instead of getting so pissed off at us all the time, why not just show us what the Hell you're talking about? Coach us a little. I mean, we can't get any worse. \nMONIX And why should I give a shit about the Tropics? \nCLARENCE I know you. You've got all that basketball shit stored up in your head. I know you're dying to pass it down to somebody. Why not us? \nMONIX What about Jackie? He's the coach. \nCLARENCE Jackie's got his hands full, trying to sell tickets. He's obsessed. (looking up, re: TV) \nHEY! IT'S OUR VIDEO! TURN THE SOUND \nUP! \nECU: THE TROPIC'S VIDEO ON TELEVISION. ON TV: The Tropics are performing a video not unlike 'The Super Bowl shuffle.' Each member takes a turn rapping, dancing around wooden palm trees with a smile. \nALL THE TROPICS (V.0.) (rapping badly) We are the Tropics hooping crew, running and gunning and dunking on you -- But we're not here to talk no trash, we're just here to do the Tropical Mash -- This is the worst video ever made. All the guys boogie around until Clarence steps forward, taking focus... \nCLARENCE (V.0.) (rapping badly) I'm Johnny Johnson and I got the moves -- If you try and stop me, I'll just get smooth -- \nKONG (V.0.) (rapping badly) My name is Kong and I ain't five feet -- But I get more ass than a toilet seat -- \nJACKIE MOON (V.O.) This is my team, so get to know them -- If you get near the lane I'll yank your scrotum -- \nALL THE TROPICS (V.0. ) -- We are the Tropics hooping crew, running and gunning and dunking too -- We're not here to talk no trash, we're just here to do the Tropical Mash -- The ball girls trot out and boogie with them. \nBALL GIRLS (V.0.) -- They're not here to talk no trash -- they're just here to do the Tropical Mash -- \nCUT BACK TO: MONIX CAN'T BELIEVE HIS EYES. Either can the bartender. Monix ignores Clarence. \nMONIX (to the bartender) Two more Johnny Walkers. \nCLARENCE So that's the way it's going to be? Monix doesn't answer, he just drinks. Clarence gets the hint and walks out. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. MONIX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nMonix looks like shit, laying on the couch, as if he hasn't moved for days. Apparently he's been drinking and smoking, but not much else. KNOCK KNOCK. Someone's at the door. REVEAL: LYNN lets herself in. Monix is so depressed, he is non-plused. \nLYNN Looking good Monix. \nMONIX Thanks. You too. \nLYNN Ms. Quincy told me the Tropics asked you to coach them. \nINT. MONIX'S BATHROOM - LATER \nECU: A SHARP NEEDLE PIERCES FLESH. Lynn is draining Monix's knee. It looks painful. \nMONIX I know what it takes to be a real team, Lynn. \nLYNN (re: his knee) Stay still. \n(BEAT) And that's the reason you won't coach them? \nJACKIE MOON This is practice, okay Clarence? We need to get two thousand people in here! Our intro dance has to blow people's minds. He begins pacing around, more passionate than ever... \nJACKIE MOON From now on, I want our afros bigger... And shinier ... . I want our shorts shorter... And tighter... We're going to pull our tube socks up higher than we ever have before. The team seems to be looking off screen. \nJACKIE MOON What's wrong? \nREVEAL: Monix has been watching this whole thing. With Monix on the court, everyone feels kind of stupid. \nJACKIE MOON Hey, you're back! Listen, you should probably chalk your hands up for this number. \nCLARENCE Jackie, I asked Monix to coach us. \nJACKIE MOON Coach? Jackie is totally thrown by this. He looks around at the team. Clearly, a decision has been made. \nJACKIE MOON What do you mean, coach? (truly hurt) What is this? What's going on? (staring his team down) It's a Mutiny. \nCLARENCE Jackie. Don't be like that. \nJACKIE MOON Hold on a second. Last time I checked, we didn't live in Flint, Russia. We live in Flint, America. I'm coach until a new one is elected. \nCLARENCE Don't make us elect Monix, man. (Jackie Moon holds firm) Alright, show of hands. Who wants Monix to step in as player-coach? Everyone feels bad, but they all raise their hands. \nJACKIE MOON Please God No. \nTWIGGY MUNSON Sorry Jackie. \nJACKIE MOON (starting to cry) It's cool. I get it. I'm a big boy, I can handle it. \nJackie cries harder. \nCLARENCE Don't take it so hard, Jackie. You're a great owner. We all know that. \nJACKIE MOON Woah. Hold on. Did you just say 'great owner?' \nCLARENCE Yeah. Everyone thinks so. \nJACKIE MOON Now, when you said great owner, were you just saying that? Because it's not cool to mess with me about this. \nCLARENCE We mean it. For real. Monix is just more of an X's and O's kind of guy, that's all. Jackie is emotional. It's a bittersweet moment. He takes off his whistle, then walks over and hands Monix his whistle. \nJACKIE MOON (re: The whistle) Here. You may need this. Now he pulls out a bunch of crazy notes on loose paper written in ball point pen. The pages look insane. \nJACKIE MOON (handing him papers) And here are some ideas for plays I've jotted down. Just thoughts. \nMONIX Thanks Jackie. (to the team) The way I see it, any team in this league can put together a run. Most of our opponents are all flash. If we play unselfish, fundamental basketball, we can win games. \nJACKIE MOON I like it. Unselfish, guys. \nMONIX Yes. Unselfish. Unselfish meaning tough team defense, full and half court traps, boxing your man out to help the team rebound. \n(BEAT) Unselfish means sprinting up the floor on every fast break NOT because you can get a DUNK -- and get your DICK SUCKED after the game -- but because if you sprint up the floor you might pull the defense out of position and free a teammate up for a high percentage shot. \nJACKIE MOON Wait, so, what's going on with the blow jobs? \nBEE BEE ELLIS I vote we keep the blow jobs. \nJACKIE MOON (raising his hand) All in favor? Everyone raises their hands in favor of blow jobs. \nCLARENCE Would everyone let the man talk please? Clarence is serious. This shuts everyone up. \nINT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - LATER \nThe starters have gotten into position, guarded by the scout team, in blue jerseys. \nMONIX The most important work we do on the court is away from the basketball. Monix FLIPS OPEN A SWITCH BLADE KNIFE AND STABS THE BALL, deflating it. This gets everyone's attention. \nMONIX (re: deflated ball) Until you start moving like a real team, you practice without a ball. \nHe flings the deflated ball into the bleachers and snaps the knife closed. \nMONIX Alright, Clarence, run the offense. \nCLARENCE I don't get it. \nMONIX Set a pick for somebody. Clarence jogs over and stands next a scout team opponent. \nMONIX Okay, that's kind of a pick, I guess. Try standing on the other side of Scootsie's man, so you free him up to cut into the lane. Monix corrects Clarence, moving his body the way he wants him to stand. \nMONIX \nMOVE MOVE MOVE! FOURTH QUARTER NOW! \nFOURTH QUARTER! \nJACKIE MOON You're fired! \nMONIX Fuck you. \nJACKIE MOON Fuck you. \nMONIX Get up and run. You're going to puke like everybody else. \nJACKIE MOON Monix, I need to talk to you. \nMONIX We'll. talk after you puke. GO! \nJackie can't get up, but he crawls, dying... \nJACKIE MOON I can't puke Monix! \nMONIX Yes you can. Go. Jackie crawls harder along the hardwood. \nJACKIE MOON Monix! You don't understand. I've never thrown up in my life. \nMONIX What are you talking about? \nJACKIE MOON I've never puked. Ever. \nMONIX That makes no sense. Everyone has thrown up before. \nJACKIE MOON I haven't. I swear to God. I can eat anything. I can drink anything. I've been sick, but I've never puked. I swear to God. \nMONIX That's bullshit. Keep moving, you're going to puke. \nJACKIE MOON I don't puke. I can't do it! It's the truth! I swear on my Mother's grave. At this point, Monix can't help but be intrigued. \nMONIX What about when you were a baby? Babies throw up all the time. \nJACKIE MOON My Mom said I never did. I swear. She said I was fascinating. \nMONIX No way. \nJACKIE MOON You can call my Dad! I've never puked. When Jackie looks up at Monix, it's clear he is not lying. \nMONIX Isn't that kind of dangerous? \nJACKIE MOON What do you mean? \nMONIX What happens if you swallow poison? \nJACKIE MOON I don't know. I ate bad sausage before. But nothing happened. \nMONIX Stand up. Jackie manages to stand up. \nMONIX Have you ever been punched in the Jejunum? \nJACKIE MOON I don't know. What's a Jejunum? \nMONIX It's part of your small intestine. \nJACKIE MOON I don't know. I doubt-- \nBOOM. \nMONIX'S POWERFUL FIST LIFTS JACKIE'S TORSO IN THE AIR. ECU: Monix's knowing fist digs deep under Jackie's rib cage. It's the hardest punch ever filmed. ON JACKIE'S REACTION: He stands, beyond pain, empty of any possible air. The blood leaves his face andhis eyesbecome confused, watering strangely. Part of Jackie's brain wants tospeak,buthe feelsunhuman-- his lips separate only slightly. He wanders out of frame. \nEXT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLLESIUM - LATER - DAY \nA SIDE DOOR BURSTS OPEN. JACKIE STUMBLES OUT INTO DAYLIGHT, \nINTO THE GRASS. HE PAUSES, THEN SUDDENLY STARTS RUNNING, BUT \nSTOPS, CONFUSED, LIKE A WOUNDED GAZELLE... \nJACKIE STAGGERS FURTHER, USING A TREE TO KEEP HIS BALANCE AS \nJACKIE MOON \nVAKIDIS! NO!!! \nVAKIDIS TAKES THE BALL AND GOES FOR A DUNK -- \nLIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) Vakidis takes it up strong to the basket... \nBAM! JACKIE MOON TACKLES VAKIDIS INTO THE STANDS. \nLIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) Ooh. He gets taken out hard by the coach. \nLOU REDWOOD (V.0.) Nice! The ball bounces into the air, rolls around the rim... And \nDROPS IN. \nLIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) And the basket is... GOOD! \nBUZZER! FINAL SCORE. TROPICS 100 PRO STARS 91. \nJACKIE MOON Shit. \nINT. DAIQUIRI ROOM - LATER \nThe daiquiri room is crowded with guys. JACKIE is having a team meeting. \nJACKIE MOON I asked you up to the Daiquiri room, because this is a private matter. (everyone looks around) As you know, I threw up recently. \nIt was the first time in my life. And, well, it's made me feel... I guess you could say I've got a new clarity in life. (Everyone stares back) Since vomiting on Wednesday, I've been facing my demons. I'm not going to be an imposter any more. \n(BEAT) And I want you to know, I just mailed out 562 corn dog coupons. \n(BEAT) And I'd like to bring somebody special in... DUKES! Dukes walks in. He is still shirtless. Jackie hands him a duffel bag. \nJACKIE MOON In this bag, is ten thousand dollars. \nDUKES No way. Really? \nJACKIE MOON Actually, it's twenty three hundred. But I'm going to pay you the rest. The Tropics will not let you down. From now on, I want my conscience clear. \nDUKES Wow. Thanks Jackie. \nJACKIE MOON Can I confess something to everyone? It's something I've never told anybody. \nCLARENCE What is it? \nJACKIE MOON You know my song 'Love Me Sexy?' \nSCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY Everyone knows that song. \nJACKIE MOON I stole it. \nTWIGGY MUNSON No. \nJACKIE MOON It's true. (turns away, dramatic) My Mom wrote it. Three weeks before she died. And I stole it. Even Monix is fascinated by this. \nBEE BEE ELLIS Wait, your Mom wrote that? Was she a singer? \nJACKIE MOON No, she wrote it on a napkin. I duped the whole world. I'm nothing but a fraud. \n(BEAT) It's true, I'm a famous singer. And I've landed the hottest wife in the world. But, to be honest, we usually only sleep together once a year. On VJ day. \nCLARENCE Damn. VJ day? That's cold. \nJACKIE MOON (ignoring Kong) And even on that day, I don't feel like it's me who's sleeping with her. \nBEE BEE ELLIS What does that mean? \nJACKIE MOON She married me because of my song, but I didn't write it. So sometimes I feel like it's not even me who's with her. (more emotional) Deep down, I feel like it's really my Mom who is making love to her. When I hold Lucy's supple breasts in my hands, they are my Mom's hands. When I eat a pair of edible panties off of her, they are my Mom's teeth. \nDUKES That's pretty weird. \nJACKIE MOON I'm living in a prison, Dukes. \nCLARENCE Why don't you write a song yourself? Then you wouldn't feel like a fake any more. \nJACKIE MOON Oh please! I could never write anything as brilliant as 'Love Me Sexy!' (standing tall) Listen to me, Tropics. Today is a new day. I am going to be the greatest basketball owner you've ever seen. And we're going to make it to fourth place. MUSIC CUE: HOT CHOCOLATE 'EVERY 1's A WINNER.' MEGA-MONTAGE: THE TROPICAL FEVER SEQUENCE. (Note: The music fades in and out throughout as needed). -PRE GAME: The Tropics do their 'intro dance.' They perform the waterfall down into.a cool pose. The crowd loves it. -TROPIC HIGHLIGHTS: They run a fast break weave, Monix makes the layup. Clarence penetrates and dishes to Jackie for a pull up jumper. -THE TROPICAL AISLE: Fat people in Hawaiian shirts go crazy. A lady chucks her nachos at the other team. -RESULTS: The scoreboard shows a Tropics win. -ATTENDANCE: A clicker counts up to 182 fans. -MORE INTRO EXCITEMENT: Jackie introduces his starting five. \nCOMMISH Listen, my office has been getting your numbers. You claim you've had over two thousand people at every home game this month. \nJACKIE MOON (dead pan) That's correct. The commissioner looks around, skeptical. As we scan the stands, it's clear the crowd is still not big enough. \nCOMMISH Well, we've counted only nine hundred and eighty three here tonight. \nJACKIE MOON What, you don't think people go to the bathroom? (Commish isn't buying it) Saturdays can be a little slow. You should have been here the other night, it was SO PACKED. \nCOMMISH Don't bullshit me, Jackie. The commish waves over a little bald man in a suit. PEEKSKILL carries a brief case and never talks. \nCOMMISH From now on, Peekskill here will be attending every Tropics home game. You're going to have to get a real crowd here if you want to qualify for the merger. \nINT. TELEVISION STUDIO - DAY \nJackie Moon is being interviewed on a local talk show. \nINTERVIEWER So, the Tropics will be at a size disadvantage against the Americans. How do you intend to match up with their strong inside game? \nJACKIE MOON Tomorrow, at half time, I, Jackie Moon, will wrestle a bear. \nINTERVIEWER Oh, well there's something. But, defensively, as a team, do you \nTHINK-- \nJACKIE MOON --That's tomorrow! One night only! See Dewie the wrestling bear attack me. He's killed people in public before. \nINTERVIEWER Okay, well, that's some half time show. \nJACKIE MOON \nI'M TELLING YOU, NOBODY CAN MISS \nTHIS! IF YOU'RE A CHILD, TAKE MONEY \nOUT OF YOUR MOTHER'S PURSE AND WALK \nTO FLINT MICHIGAN FAIRGROUNDS \nCOLISEUM! EIGHT O'CLOCK! \nINTERVIEWER Well, there you have it. Jackie Moon, thanks for stopping by. From channel 5, this is Mick Kenterman, signing off. Good night. \nJACKIE MOON \nDEWIE IS INSANE. HE COULD RIP MY \nHEAD OFF! \nEXT. LYNN'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nLYNN carries the garbage out. As she closes the lid, she notices something. REVEAL: Monix is standing in the yard. \nLYNN Well, if it isn't the toast of Flint Michigan. Shouldn't you be out signing autographs? Monix doesn't speak... He stares into her eyes for a moment. \nMONIX Will you marry me? \nLYNN What? \nMONIX You heard me. \nLYNN Technically, we're still married right now, Monix. \nMONIX You know what I mean. \nLYNN Do I? \nMONIX Do you love me? \nLYNN Probably. \nMONIX Then let's do it. For real this time. I need you. \nLYNN Shit. I know you need me, Monix. The question is, do I need you? \nKYLE (O.S.) \nWHAT'S UP MONIX!? Kyle pokes his head out of the screen door. He wears a Flint Jersey with Monix on the back. \nPLEASE GOD, SOMEONE SPUMONI! I'M \nBEGGING YOU, CLARENCE. \nCLARENCE THE REF \nLOOKING GOOD, BOSS. \nJACKIE IS HANGING HALF WAY OUT OF THE RING. HE'S NOSE TO NOSE.: \nWITH THE BEAR HANDLER. \nJACKIE MOON (screaming at the bear \nHANDLER) \nGELATO! ALMOND ICE CREAM! (in Italian) Asta zittu'sto parcnuso spumoni! \nBEAR HANDLER (to Clarence) \nWE HAVE TO STOP IT! \nCLARENCE THE REF \nNO WAY! I'M THE REF! \nBEAR HANDLER (climbing in) Screw this, I'm stopping it. The bear handler tries to get into the ring with a stick and loop. But CLARENCE TRIES TO PUSH THE BEAR HANDLER back out of the ring. \nDEWIE TURNS TO FIND HIS HANDLER IN DANGER. \nLIKE LIGHTENING, THE BEAR MAULS CLARENCE. \nCLARENCE THE REF \nAAAHHHHH!!! I'M THE REF!!! \nSPUMONI!!! DING! The first round is over, but the bear does not return to his corner. \nCLARENCE THE REF \nTHE BELL RANG! SPUMONI!!! \nMUSIC CUE: 'KING KONG' BY JIMMY CASTOR \nMONTAGE: SOLD OUT FLINT ROLLS TOWARD FOURTH. The Tropics play awesome. \nA SIGN SAYS 'SOLD OUT!' \nLIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) And it's another sell-out crowd for the Flint Michigan Tropics. \nBUZZER! FINAL SCORE: TROPICS 111 COLONELS 98. \nAGAIN, THE SIGN SAYS: SOLD OUT! \nBUZZER! FINAL SCORE: TROPICS 90 SQUIRES 81. \nLIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) Taking it strong to the rim is Coffee Black. Yes! This sold out crowd is going nuts. You've been a little quiet Lou, how are you doing? \nLOU REDWOOD (V.0.) A Mexican stole my bike. \nBUZZER! FINAL SCORE: TROPICS 92 AMERICANS 87. \nON THE SIGN: SOLD OUT! \nBUZZER! FINAL SCORE: TROPICS 105 CONQUISTADORS 91. The team celebrates the win. \nLIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) And, believe it or not, the Flint Tropics are in perfect position to qualify for the NBA merger. If they win their final game, they'll clinch fourth place. But nothing is ever easy against the first place San Antonio Spurs. As Jackie does a victory dance, the commissioner approaches. \nCOMMISH Jackie. \nJACKIE MOON Oh, hey Commish. Good game huh? And a packed house too. \nCOMMISH I need to talk to you... And the rest of your team. Alone. \nINT. LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT \nThe whole team stands solemnly. \nCLARENCE So, that's just it then? \nMONIX That's just it. Clarence shakes his head and walks out. \nEXT. FLINT MICHIGAN - MORNING \nThe morning sun shines down on the sad town of Flint. Monix walks home in the street. He stops and TAKES A LEAK right in the middle of the road. A car honks at him to get out of the way, then skids to a stop. Lynn pokes her head out of the car. \nLYNN What the fuck are you doing? \nMONIX Oh. Hey Lynn. \nINT. LYNN'S HOUSE - LATER THAT DAY \nMonix is on the couch, drunk. He gazes at the TV and swigs his beer. Now LYNN walks in. \nLYNN I thought the deal was, you were going to sleep. \nMONIX Pshh. Relax. \nLYNN So, you're just going to sit here in my house and drink for the entire day? \nMONIX You got a problem with that? \nLYNN Yeah, I do. Maybe you could put some pants on and go piss off somebody else. \nMONIX Fine, maybe I will! \n(STANDING) Where are my pants? \nLYNN Tell me something, Monix- \nMONIX No. \nLYNN Whatwereyou trying to accomplish thisyear?You never really gave a shitaboutthat NBA merger, did you? Monix doesn't say anything. \nLYNN The merger, Monix, did you ever care about it? Monix still stays quiet. \nLYNN Tell me, if you didn't care about the merger, what the Hell were you playing for!? \nMONIX I wanted fourth place! Okay? That was the whole fucking thing! \nLYNN Well, guess what! Fourth place is still sitting there, waiting for you to win it! Monix doesn't look at her. \nLYNN Think about it. \nEXT. FLINT MICHIGAN - DAY \nA wide shot of an alley. We hear a familiar voice off screen. \nJACKIE MOON (O.S.) (singing bizarre) Baby, who wants to- love me sexy! baby, Ugh, are you ready to; lick me sexy!!!? Yeah yeah!! HA! INSIDE A DUMPSTER, REVEAL: Jackie lays in garbage and sings up to the sky. It's official, he has lost his mind. \nJACKIE MOON (tweaking the lyrics) I'm a big faker and I stole this; Song-ly sexy. I'm the biggest failure in the; world-ly sexy. I'm going to kill my; self-y sexy. \nBEE BEE ELLIS (O.S.) Jackie? Bee Bee Ellis hears Jackie voice and discovers him in laying the garbage. Jackie ignores his teammate. \nJACKIE MOON I'm going to hang myself with an extension; cord-y sexy. \nBEE BEE ELLIS Jackie! What the Hell are you doing in a dumpster? \nJACKIE MOON (ignoring Bee Bee) I am urinating in my pants right now. \nBEE BEE ELLIS You gotta get it together, man. Monix called a team meeting. \nINT. THE KREMLIN - LATER DAY \nThe entire team has gathered. Monix addresses them. \nMONIX Listen up. We all know that Clarence has been traded. And we all know that this game doesn't matter anymore, right? \nBEE BEE ELLIS Right. \nMONIX Well I've got news for you. This game does matter. It matters because this is the last real basketball game any of us is ever going to play. Ever. The guys nod, solemn. \nMONIX Tomorrow night, I say we leave it all out there on the floor. Because there's nothing else for us to save it for. Clarence or no Clarence. NBA or no NBA. Merger or no merger. We decided we are going to win fourth place. And that's what we're going to do. Jackie is moved. The guys look at each other and nod. \nMONIX Over the past five weeks, we've become a team. And that is no small thing. Jackie, have you ever been on a real team before? \nTHE MEGA BOWL TROPHY HIGH ABOVE OUR \nHEADS. WE'RE NOT JUST GOING TO \nFINISH IN FOURTH, WE'RE GOING TO \nTAKE HOME THE MEGA BOWL TROPHY. \nTOMORROW NIGHT AT 8 O'CLOCK! \nEXT. FLINT MICHIGAN - MORNING \nThe sun rises above the city. In the morning light, Flint looks almost electric. \nEXT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - FRIDAY NIGHT \nThe parking lot is rocking. The whole town is jazzed for the big event. \nLIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) if the commissioner is listening, I recommend he stay out of the city of Flint tonight. He's not too popular in this town. \nLOU REDWOOD (V.O.) i will stab him in the stomach with an eight inch hunting knife. \nLIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) There were many wild protests in Flint this week. But it seems like the whole city is now focused on beating the San Antonio Spurs. This team seems to have captured every heart in this town of underdogs. People have poured in from around the state to support this drive toward their first mega-bowl championship. \nINT. SPURS LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT \nClarence is getting dressed in the visitor's locker room. He holds up a Spurs Jersey and now pulls the strange colors over his head. \nLIVE ABA RADIO (V.O.) The Flint Tropics will be playing without their number one scorer, Coffee Black tonight. The Spurs have signed several new players from around the ABA, locking them in before they hit the free market in next year's expansion draft. The .big man, Pete Petrelli has been sent over from the dismantled Anaheim Amigos. Now Petrelli enters frame. The guy we hate has been traded to the Spurs too. \nPETRELLI We may be teammates, but I still think you're a dick. \nCLARENCE Thanks Petrelli. \nINT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - CONTINUOUS \nWHEELCHAIR DARREN and JODY take their positions next to the court. DUKES sits in the stands. QUINCY wears a new fur coat, sitting center court. The TROPICAL AISLE cheers, rowdy. The BALL GIRLS look almost nervous. You can feel the excitement. And now entering, by herself, standing in the back, is LYNN. She takes a deep breath. \nINT. TROPICS LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nMonix addresses the team. \nMONIX You want to know what I love? This. The eleven of us right here, right now, waiting for the biggest game of our lives to begin. \n(BEAT) I want you to remember something. I want you to remember what this feels like, to be here in this locker room together, one last time, shoulder to shoulder with these men. Because we are not ourselves tonight. We are one. This is what I love. \n(BEAT) Let's play basketball. \nINT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - LATER \nThe game is well under way. It's full tilt action. It's immediately clear that the Tropics are being over powered. QUICK CUTS: PETRELLI knocks over Monix and scores. -The Tropics offense is getting shut down. -Jackie gets a rebound, but then dribbles off his ankle. -The fans are disappointed. The guys in the Tropical Aisle are all bummed out. Wheelchair Jody looks pissed. \nLIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) Not a good first half for the Tropics so far. They're already down by ten. ON CLARENCE: He sits on the Spurs bench. \nSPURS COACH Coffee Black, you're going in. \nCLARENCE I can't. I've got back spasms. The coach stares him down, then picks another player. \nLIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) This is easily the worst half of basketball the Tropics have ever played. And that's saying something. \nLOU REDWOOD (V.0.) Yep. It's a shit fucking sandwich. \nLIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) Let's watch the F-bomb, Lou. We're live. \nLOU REDWOOD (V.0.) Oh, please, this is our last game. I can say whatever I want. Watch this: I hope Gerald Ford gets ass raped. \nLIVE TROPICS RADIO Okay then. We've got just fifteen seconds left in the first half... Here's Monix with a no-look to Jackie... He goes up strong-- \nSLO MO: PETRELLI FLIES IN AND ELBOWS JACKIE HARD IN THE HEAD. \nSLO MO: JACKIE'S HEAD SNAPS BACK... \nSLO MO: JACKIE FALLS TO THE HARDWOOD, UNCONSCIOUS, HE BOUNCES \nOFF THE FLOOR. \nLYNN Oh my God. Everyone in the stadium watches as Jackie lays out cold. \nJACKIE MOON Oh. I am? That's bad isn't it? \n(BEAT) Can you make time go backwards? \nJACKIE'S DREAM MOM Not really. Now hurry up. And don't forget what I said. Jackie walks into the clouds, then turns back. \nJACKIE MOON Hey Mom, I threw up. \nJACKIE'S DREAM MOM I know you did, sweetie. \nINT. TROPICS LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nJackie wakes from his dream. Confused. JACKIE'S POV: Bee Bee Ellis, Twiggy Munson, Scootsie Double- Day and Kong Yi look down at camera. \nBEE BEE ELLIS He's awake. \nINT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - MOMENTS LATER \nWe're back with Live ABA radio. \nLIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) This just in. It sounds like Jackie Moon is up and around the locker room. That's good news for the Tropics. \nINT. TROPICS LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nMonix coaches the team. Jackie rubs his head, not listening. \nMONIX And I don't care how quick their defense is, we need to move the ball and-- \nJACKIE MOON --Hold on you guys. I have something to tell you. \nMONIX What is it? Jackie seems very serious... \nJACKIE MOON I had a dream. I had a dream, I was in heaven and my Mother spoke to me... She was wearing a flowing white gown... And she showed me a whole new way to score a basket. She spoke to me and said with this gift, you will win fourth place.' \nBEE BEE ELLIS He's lost his mind. \nTWIGGY MUNSON We need to figure out what we're going to do in the second half. \nSCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY Yeah, we don't have time for any ghost baskets. \nJACKIE MOON \nYOU WILL NOT SPEAK OF MY MOTHER \nTHIS WAY! THIS SHOT IS MAGICAL! \nDON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? Jackie's eyes are intense and he's breathing way too hard. This dream was real.

DANCE FLOOR - MEANWHILE \nJackie is dancing to his own song, still wearing the ice packs on his knees. The song ends and A DIFFERENT ONE STARTS. \nJACKIE MOON (looking to the DJ) Hold on a second. \nMELINDA What's wrong? \nJACKIE MOON Where's the boogie? Jackie fights his way through the crowd to the DJ booth. \nJACKIE MOON (to DJ, over music) \nHEY! WHERE'S THE BOOGIE? \nDJ \nI ALREADY PLAYED YOUR SONG FOUR \nTIMES. \nJACKIE MOON \nGET UP. \nDJ \nNO. YOU CAN'T KEEP DOING THIS, \nJACKIE. I'M THE DJ. \nJACKIE MOON (taking over as DJ) \nNOT ANY MORE. YOU'RE ON SNACK \nPATROL. SCREECH -- The music stops. \nJACKIE MOON (into the mic) The year was 1973. A young musician named Jackie Moon, finishes years of musical training, only to find he is a slave to the notes on the page. He knows it's time to break free. In a sudden fit of creative mastery, he grabs a pen and a napkin and writes a song that breaks all the rules. Ladies and gentleman... Let's get sweaty. MUSIC CUE: Jackie's song. Everyone goes crazy. \nJACKIE MOON (V.0.) (studio version) Baby, who wants to; love me sexy. baby, are you ready to; lick me sexy. Take off your shoes and; suck me sexy. Baby, we're naked and we're; humping sexy-- \nINT. DAIQUIRI ROOM - NIGHT \nGayle and Monix walk upstairs into the 'coolest' room ever. Carpet on the ceiling, a plaid couch, a fish tank, a water bed, mirrors, etc. \nGAYLE I'm glad they traded for you, I got myself a cute one. \nMONIX So, this is the Daiquiri room? \nLUCY MOON (O.S. ) That's right. REVEAL: LUCY MOON, Jackie's wife, is on the couch. She's the hottest girl in the world. \nLUCY MOON What do you think, Gayle? Does he like it with my boots on, or does he like my boots off? \nGAYLE He seems like a boots on kind of guy. \nLUCY MOON Then it looks like I'm ready. As soon as you slide these shorts off of me. \nMONIX Aren't you Jackie's wife? \nLUCY MOON He knows about the Daiquiri room. \nGAYLE It's a new tradition we're starting, when new players join. \nMONIX I see. Well, I'm going to have to pass. I'm good, thanks. \nLUCY MOON Honey, you don't know what good is. With that, Lucy flicks on the stereo-- \nMUSIC CUE: THE BAR KEYS 'TOO HOT TO STOP.' \nMONIX Listen um... (i.e. what's your name?) \nGAYLE My name is 'no strings attached.' \nLUCY MOON You can call me Mrs. Moon. Gayle and Lucy perform a funky/seductive dance, moving closer and closer to Monix. \n", "test1_true": "LUCY MOON It has to. \nGAYLE It's bad luck if you don't. \nMONIX Yeah, I'd hate to bring bad luck to Flint Michigan. Lucy has sprayed some WHIP CREAM on her nipples. \nLUCY MOON (whip cream) Why don't you lick these clean for me? \nMONIX I can't eat dairy. Lucy decides that now is a good time to aggressively KISS him. Monix pushes her away. \nMONIX Nice tits, Mrs. Moon. I gotta go. Monix walks down the stairs. \nLUCY MOON (calling after him) I see what this is: You want us to send Eric and Marcus up here? On the way out, Monix flicks her off. \nINT. LYNN'S HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT \nLynn is asleep next to Kyle. She awakes to someone pounding on the door. \nEXT. LYNN'S FRONT YARD - NIGHT \nLynn has arrived at the screen door. Monix, wasted, doesn't notice Lynn yet, he keeps pounding until she opens it. \nLYNN Why are you here? \nMONIX I got traded. \nLYNN I mean, why are you here? \nMONIX Can we talk? \nKYLE (O.S.) --Yo, Monix, you're wasted! Ha! Kyle has come out to say hi. \nMONIX Yeah. Sorry man-- \nKYLE What's up! That of jump shot of yours ain't broke yet, is it? \nMONIX No. Ha. \nKYLE Great back door cut for the lay-up in the third. That's how basketball should be played. \nMONIX Kyle, can you give us a second? We need to talk. \nKYLE No problem. Great game tonight man. \nMONIX Why does your boyfriend like me so much? \nLYNN You're his favorite player. \nMONIX Look, there are still some things I think we need to talk about. \nLYNN I've already said everything I'm ever going to say to you. \nMONIX I see. \n(BEAT) Well, I guess I'll be leaving then. Monix walks away... Then turns back. \nMONIX You're really not going to stop me? \nLYNN No. Monix walks more, until Lynn speaks. \nLYNN You're going to end up walking with a cane the rest of your life. You have to quit. \nMONIX And do what? \nLYNN I don't know... Kill yourself, I guess. \nMONIX Kill myself? \nLYNN You act like there's nothing else in the world besides basketball.

It's 4 a.m. Lynn stares at him in disbelief. Monix shrugs. \nMONIX No one here can drain it right. \nLYNN Fine. Monix nods, then makes a move toward the door. \nLYNN No. You're not coming in. We'll do it in the yard. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. JACKIE'S MONTE CARLO - DAYS LATER \nJackie drives in his car, practicing for the meeting. tries to build some confidence. \nJACKIE MOON (into the rear view, very \nCIVILIZED) Well, hello Commissioner -- Why sure, I would love one of your Puerto Rican cigars -- Oh, I know I'm a legitimate owner, you don't have to tell me that -- We're merging with the NBA? Oh, that's nice -- Ha Ha Ha! Good one, Commish ... \nEXT. INDIANAPOLIS - CONTINUOUS \nA brick building on the outskirts of Indianapolis. A sign says. WELCOME ABA OWNERS. Jackie pulls into the lot and parks. He looks in the mirror one last time. \nJACKIE MOON Your Mom would be proud of you today. \nINT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nNot-quite-Rich guys surround a large oak table. JACKIE is by far the youngest of the owners. \nCOMMISH .I'm sure each of you have heard the rumors. And I'm here to tell you, the rumors are true. The ABA will be merging with the NBA at the end of this season. \nJACKIE MOON \nYES!!! (to an old guy) \nGIVE ME TEN, NORTON! YES!! (fists to the ceiling) \nEVERYONE CAN EAT SHIT! I AM THE \nGREATEST MAN IN THE WORLD! \nCOMMISH Our league is sold. And the NBA agreed to all of our financial demands! Now Jackie turns inward, more quietly intense. This is, without question, the greatest moment of his life. \nJACKIE MOON (to himself) You're a real owner. You're in the \nNBA. \nCOMMISH Four of our teams will be absorbed into the NBA family, the rest of you will terminate operations. \nJACKIE MOON Exactly! You know it! (now hearing) I'm sorry, wait, what? \nCOMMISH The Nuggets, The Nets, The Spurs and the Pacers will play in the NBA next year. The rest of us will dissolve. \nJACKIE MOON Dissolve? Dissolve, like, how? How do I dissolve into the NBA? The winning owners look at each other, not sure how to handle Jackie. \nJACKIE MOON What's happening? \nCOMMISH I'm sorry Jackie. We all know how. emotional you get. We waited until the very last second to tell you. Jackie pounds the table. \nJACKIE MOON No. NO! NO!!! He kicks over his chair... \nTHE COMMISH We know you're upset, Jackie. But you'll be very well compensated. \nLOSING OWNER #1 Everyone's agreed to a very large sum. \nJACKIE MOON I don't want a sum! I want my team! (to the losing owners) C'mon you guys, you're not going to just sit here and take the money, are you? They are. \nJACKIE MOON (to winning owners) What do the Spurs have that we don't? \nTHE COMMISH A huge fan base. A brand new stadium. A solid economic growth package, including strong tax incentives. \nJACKIE MOON Oh, c'mon, that's BULLSHIT! \nCOMMISH The NBA is taking four teams, Jackie, there's nothing I can do. Jackie goes quiet, thinking... An epic idea hits him. \n", "test2_true": "COMMISH What? \nJACKIE MOON Forget the huge fan base, the stadiums, the economic... (a little lost) Growing... package... inventions... \nWINNING OWNER #1 (correcting him) Economic growth pack-- \nJACKIE MOON \nI KNOW WHAT I SAID! (to the room) The four teams with the best records should merge. \nLOSING OWNER #2 He's right. \nLOSING OWNER #1 Yeah, that's the fairest way. \nCOMMISH These four teams DO have the best records. Flint's only won six games all year! \nJACKIE MOON So far. The season isn't over. \nLOSING OWNER #2 Yeah, maybe we should finish the season first. \nCOMMISH This plan sounds like a lot of fun, but it's too late. The commissioner, me, has already decided. \nLOSING OWNER #2 Actually, the terms of a merger can only be approved by a league mandate. \nJACKIE MOON YES. That's right. What he said. \nLOSING OWNER #1 I move that we vote on the terms of the merger. \nEXT. FLINT MICHIGAN FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - NEXT DAY \nThe team sits around the parking lot, sitting on their duffle bags, dejected. Jackie is having a team meeting. \nJACKIE MOON C'mon you guys, let's try to stay psyched. This is a chance to become a real NBA franchise! \nCLARENCE There's no way we can make it to fourth place. It's mathematically impossible. \nJACKIE MOON I ran the numbers. All we have to do is win about eighty-two percent of our remaining games. \nCLARENCE Eighty-two percent? Isn't that a lot? \nJACKIE MOON Oh, c'mon! We just gotta start hitting our threes. (guys look around, unsure) Listen, I know this seems like bad news, but it doesn't have to be. This is a big road trip for us. We've just got to start playing solid Flint basketball. \nSCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY I don't know. We suck, man. \nJACKIE SLAPS SCOOTSIE. \nJACKIE MOON (re: The slap) Sorry. \nJACKIE SLAPS HIM AGAIN, HARDER. \nJACKIE MOON We do not suck, okay? We just have to want it! \nPumped, Jackie walks around with his hands on his hips. \nBEE BEE ELLIS What do you think, Monix? All eyes turn on the grumpy one. \nMONIX I think we suck. \nJACKIE MOON Well... See, now there's some team unity! Now let's load up the jet. REVEAL: A SHITTY SCHOOL BUS has the words 'THE JET!' Spray- painted in graffiti letters with a palm tree next to it. \nJACKIE MOON (as they load up) Now we've got a special treat. You know I take care of my family. Today, the Jet is catered. I had Downtown's Mom pack us some hot dish. \nBEE BEE ELLIS Ms. Quincy's hot dish? Sweet! \nINT. BUS - CONTINUOUS \nThe guys load up. It's so packed it's ridiculous. Everyone tries to stuff their gear somewhere and sit down. Jackie carries a big pot of hot dish, accidentally burning Scootsie's back. \nSCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY Ah, watch the hot dish, man. \nJACKIE MOON Sorry Scootsie. \nTWIGGY MUNSON Hey Jackie, there's some dude out there, wants to talk to you. POV: Out the window, we can see DUKES, the full court shot winner, holding his GIANT CHECK and looking into the bus. He's still shirtless, with a star-spangled headband. \nEXT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - MOMENTS LATER \n", "test2_id": 1633, "test3_input": "CLARENCE (to the bartender) Johnny for short. (to Brian, re: Monix) Two coffees. \nMONIX So, what brings you to the The Kremlin? \nCLARENCE Listen, I know you and I haven't always been the best of buddies. \nBut I've been thinking about what you said the other night. This is gonna be our last chance. If I'm ever going to get into the NBA, it's going to be with the Tropics. \nMONIX I hate to break it to you, Clarence, but the Tropics will never play in the NBA. \nCLARENCE So maybe we won't. But like you said, I don't want to look back on this with any regrets. I know what you think of me. But I'm willing to put our differences aside. I'm telling you right now, I'll do whatever it takes to win. \nMONIX You mean, like, pass? \nCLARENCE (with a smile) I would consider passing, yes. \nMONIX Sorry kid. Even if I wanted to play harder, this knee won't let me. \nCLARENCE I'm not just talking about you playing point guard... I'm talking about you teaching us... Monix could not be less interested. \nCLARENCE Monix, you know more about basketball than any man who's ever set foot in Flint. Monix drinks, not into it... \nCLARENCE All I'm saying is, instead of getting so pissed off at us all the time, why not just show us what the Hell you're talking about? Coach us a little. I mean, we can't get any worse. \nMONIX And why should I give a shit about the Tropics? \nCLARENCE I know you. You've got all that basketball shit stored up in your head. I know you're dying to pass it down to somebody. Why not us? \nMONIX What about Jackie? He's the coach. \nCLARENCE Jackie's got his hands full, trying to sell tickets. He's obsessed. (looking up, re: TV) \nHEY! IT'S OUR VIDEO! TURN THE SOUND \nUP! \nECU: THE TROPIC'S VIDEO ON TELEVISION. ON TV: The Tropics are performing a video not unlike 'The Super Bowl shuffle.' Each member takes a turn rapping, dancing around wooden palm trees with a smile. \nALL THE TROPICS (V.0.) (rapping badly) We are the Tropics hooping crew, running and gunning and dunking on you -- But we're not here to talk no trash, we're just here to do the Tropical Mash -- This is the worst video ever made. All the guys boogie around until Clarence steps forward, taking focus... \nCLARENCE (V.0.) (rapping badly) I'm Johnny Johnson and I got the moves -- If you try and stop me, I'll just get smooth -- \nKONG (V.0.) (rapping badly) My name is Kong and I ain't five feet -- But I get more ass than a toilet seat -- \nJACKIE MOON (V.O.) This is my team, so get to know them -- If you get near the lane I'll yank your scrotum -- \nALL THE TROPICS (V.0. ) -- We are the Tropics hooping crew, running and gunning and dunking too -- We're not here to talk no trash, we're just here to do the Tropical Mash -- The ball girls trot out and boogie with them. \nBALL GIRLS (V.0.) -- They're not here to talk no trash -- they're just here to do the Tropical Mash -- \nCUT BACK TO: MONIX CAN'T BELIEVE HIS EYES. Either can the bartender. Monix ignores Clarence. \nMONIX (to the bartender) Two more Johnny Walkers. \nCLARENCE So that's the way it's going to be? Monix doesn't answer, he just drinks. Clarence gets the hint and walks out. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. MONIX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nMonix looks like shit, laying on the couch, as if he hasn't moved for days. Apparently he's been drinking and smoking, but not much else. KNOCK KNOCK. Someone's at the door. REVEAL: LYNN lets herself in. Monix is so depressed, he is non-plused. \nLYNN Looking good Monix. \nMONIX Thanks. You too. \nLYNN Ms. Quincy told me the Tropics asked you to coach them. \nINT. MONIX'S BATHROOM - LATER \nECU: A SHARP NEEDLE PIERCES FLESH. Lynn is draining Monix's knee. It looks painful. \nMONIX I know what it takes to be a real team, Lynn. \nLYNN (re: his knee) Stay still. \n(BEAT) And that's the reason you won't coach them? \n", "test3_true": "LYNN Do you really hate basketball? Or do you hate yourself? \nMONIX Why would I hate myself? \nLYNN Well, for one, you cheated on me. \nMONIX You hate me for that. Not me. Lynn just stares at him. \nMONIX Okay, maybe I hate myself a little. \nLYNN You don't wear the ring around your neck anymore. (no response) Where is it? \nMONIX I rode the bench through the playoffs, Lynn. \nLYNN Monix, that was greatest moment of your career. And you look back on it like some kind of embarrassment. \nMONIX Riding the bench was the greatest moment of my career? \nLYNN You did more than ride the bench, Monix. \nMONIX What else did I do? \nLYNN Every practice, you took your team to the limit. I know you did. I was the one draining this stupid knee of yours every night. The Celtics were practicing against you, Monix. And when you ran that scout team, you were running Milwaukee's offense better than their first stringers ever could. Lynn continues the business of disposing fluid into the toilet and preparing another syringe. \nLYNN By game time, your team knew where Milwaukee was going to be before their own players did. The Celtics made the right adjustments to win that series. And those adjustments came from you. \nMONIX So, I should be proud of running the scout team? \nLYNN Dave Cowens put that ring in the palm of your hand. And he told you to wear it with pride, because you were a champion. And he meant it too. \nMONIX He was being a nice guy. The bench is the bench. \nLYNN Your whole life, you've bitched about people playing selfish. It takes a team to win, right? \nMONIX That's right. \nLYNN But when you're on the team, your effort doesn't count? Is that it? \n(BEAT) If you weren't on the Celtics that year, would they have won it? \nMONIX Watch that needle. \nLYNN Answer me. Would they have won? \nMONIX I don't know. \nLYNN Yes you do. You know. Monix looks away for a moment. \nMONIX Why are you doing this? What does any of this matter, anyway? \nLYNN What's it matter? You're drinking yourself to death! \n(BEAT) God, I wish I hated you as much as you hate yourself! Lynn throws the needle. Monix dodges it. \nLYNN I made sacrifices! How many years did I support you? And finally, after all of our blood and sweat and bullshit together, you got there, Monix! You made it, you won an NBA championship ring. It wasn't just about you, okay? And I'm sick of you acting like you're some kind of joke. You didn't blow it. You're not a fraud. You're not a fake champion. And all the time we spent together, fighting for you to get to that moment, was not a waste! You're a champion, you asshole! \n(BEAT) \nBut if you want to drink yourself to death, go ahead. Fuck you. With that, Lynn is gone. Monix stands alone in the bathroom, then checks his knee. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLLISEUM - NEXT DAY \nIt's practice. But this isn't basketball, it's DANCE PRACTICE. The entire team performs a complicated 'intro- dance.' \nJACKIE MOON \n(CHOREOGRAPHING) 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and turn like you mean it -- Bee Bee, Arch that back. Yes. Now, the waterfall... One by one, each dips down like a waterfall. And now a leg kick. \nJACKIE MOON Nice leg kick Kong. Those flexible hips are a coach's dream. \n(BEAT) Now big finish -- and freeze. And then we start the game after that. \nCLARENCE Are we going to practice or what? \n", "test3_id": 1634}

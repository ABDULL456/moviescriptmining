SHELLY I don't know, tonight you just seemed a little cool, not opening car doors and... 
HARRY Oh, that was Phil, trying to give me advice on dating 70's women. Look I'm so out of touch, I haven't dated women in ages, not since my wife died. 
SHELLY What happened to her? 
HARRY Ahh, complications during child birth, she died two days after Vada was born. 
SHELLY Did she ever see Vada? 
HARRY I brought the baby into the room a couple of times, she opened her eyes, yeah, yeah I think she saw Vada. It was..... 
Harry looks at the item that he picked up and was fiddling with to calm his nerves 
Did I ruin this? 
SHELLY Dance with me? 
HARRY Here? 
SHELLY This is where we are. 
HARRY Is there enough room? 
Shelly moves an object from the floor, which creates more room 
HARRY I haven't danced in..... 
SHELLY In ages, I know, me neither. 
They begin a slow dance 
HARRY Rock? 
SHELLY See, you're not that out of touch. (they dance) You're good. 
HARRY At Widdman High I was considered a pretty hot date, I did a killer frugue. 
Shelly smells Harry's neck 
SHELLY What are you wearing? 
HARRY Old Spice, Phil says it's a timeless classic. 
They continue to dance 
SHELLY Do you want to? 
HARRY Want to what? 
SHELLY Kiss me. 
HARRY Yes. 
SHELLY Good. 
They then have a long kiss 
SHELLY Good at kissing, and dancing, I'm very optimistic. 
They then kiss again, this time interrupted by the clock cuckooing 
HARRY I ahh, better go. 
SHELLY It's only eight o'clock.

The Mark pulls the straps of her swimsuit up over her shoulders. Stares in a mirror as she tucks strands of hair under a swim cap. 
INT. INDOOR POOL - NIGHT 
Quiet, lit from overhead by large halogen lights hanging from the hanger-like beam structure. Dark shadows in the corners. The low sound of water lapping, light reflecting off the water, moving over walls. 
The Mark enters, and hangs up her robe. She goes to the edge of the pool, looks down into the water, then glances up at the GUARD who's stationed across the space. He nods back to her, moves to the lower space, giving her a little privacy. 
EXT. POOL STRUCTURE - NIGHT 
A second guard looks in, rudely checks out the Mark as she DIVES into the water and out of sight. He shrugs, looks back out at the roof, lifting a cigarette to light... pauses. ACROSS THE ROOF, an access door is open. 
INT. INDOOR POOL - NIGHT 
The Mark swims, hard. Cutting through the water. She reaches the far wall and kick-turns against it. UNDERWATER. Her body passing above us. Silhouetted by the strong halogen lights above her. ONLY THE THROBBING SILENCE 
OF UNDERWATER. ACROSS THE SPACE. The indoor guard checks in on his radio. Looks up as the DOOR nearest him swings open. He rises, approaches the door, curious. Looks out. HIS P.O.V.: The rooftop, lit by security lights, the strobing of the firetrucks below. Dark shadows. He hears a RUSTLING, a BANGING. Torn, he glances backwards. Can't see the Mark in the pool from here, but can hear her strokes. 
WITH THE MARK She kicks hard, dives under... And we're in her P.O.V. The far wall approaching, then we REVOLVE as she turns, now looking UP at the surface as she backstrokes to the surface, BREAKING THE SURFACE, now swimming face up to the bright lights hanging from the girdered ceiling. 
EXT. POOL STRUCTURE - NIGHT 
The second Guard tests the door. Seems fine. Takes out his flashlight and plays it over the roof. Sees nothing. We REVERSE to find Steve there, tucked away, just out of sight. 
ACROSS THE ROOF The first guard reaches the source of the noise: A plastic bag, caught in a revolving air vent. He pulls it free. 
INT. INDOOR POOL - CONTINUOUS 
With the Mark, coming out of another turn, still backstroke, looking up. She makes it half way across the pool... pauses. She slows... floating, staring upwards into the light. HER P.O.V. The lights. But it's like she senses something beyond them, puts a hand up to shield her eyes... 
AND BISHOP DROPS FROM THE CEILING, FREE-FALL, COMING STRAIGHT 
DOWN AT HER!!!! She opens her mouth to scream... WHUUMPH! He goes in, taking her with him underwater, his momentum carrying them both several feet under. She TWISTS in his arms, fighting. Screaming, bubbles FLOWING from her mouth! ABOVE THE SURFACE. It's silent. No sign of the violent struggle going on below the surface. ACROSS THE ROOM. Guard number one returns, glances up towards the pool. Doesn't hear anything. He sits back in his chair. UNDERWATER. The struggle is violent, silent, terrible in it's inevitable conclusion. The Mark writhes and jerks but Bishop holds her tight, always pulling her away from the surface. Finally, the fight goes out of her. She goes limp in his arms. He turns her, stares into her unseeing eyes. Then lets her go, rising slowly to the surface. AT THE SURFACE. Bishop just breaks, breathing in, silent. He raises himself slightly, sees the guard at his post. ACROSS THE ROOM. The guard glances back towards the pool, hasn't heard anything for a little bit... BAM! BAM! BAM! A new noise from outside gets his attention again. He heads out, hand on his sidearm... 
EXT. POOL STRUCTURE, ROOFTOP - NIGHT 
The guard approaches the same door Guard #2 already checked, banging in the wind. Open again. He starts to move towards it when a FIGURE looms, he almost draws his weapon, breathes relief when he makes Guard #2. 
GUARD #2 (TURKISH) It's the second time it's come open. She still swimming? 
INT. POOL STRUCTURE - NIGHT 
The two Guards come into the pool area. On the far wall, the shower is running, a towel has fallen over the drain and the water is flowing down and into the pool. One of the men steps forward, concerned... 
GUARD #2 (TURKISH) Oh hell... The Mark floats face-up in the pool, just under the surface. 
INT. CHANGING ROOM, EMBASSY - NIGHT 
Bishop has already shed his wet clothing, pulls on dry clothes as Steve comes into the room. They barely acknowledge each other, business. Bishop stuffs the wet clothes in a bag, dumps it into a LAUNDRY chute. 
STEVE How did it go -- 
BISHOP Not yet. As if on cue, an ALARM BLARES. Excited voices come on over an embassy wide PA System. VOICES from the next room. Bishop opens the chute again as Steve cracks a glowstick, puts it between his teeth, swings his legs in, and DROPS. ACROSS THE ROOM. The door to the dressing room opens, armed guards flood in, along with Embassy officials speaking on radios. The room is empty. 
INT. LAUNDRY CHUTE - CONTINUOUS 
Tight, PITCH BLACK except for the eerie glow coming from the glowsticks Bishop and Steve have in their teeth. They slide FAST, the sides of the tube RUSHING up at them. And then suddenly a dim LIGHT at the bottom, rising fast... 
INT. SERVICE ROOM, EMABASSY - CONTINUOUS

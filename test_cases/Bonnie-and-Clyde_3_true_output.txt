CLYDE I always feel like we're separate from everybody else. 
BONNIE (it's terribly important to her) Do you, baby? 
Suddenly there is a ring at the door.  BONNIE and CLYDE freeze. 
INT. LIVING ROOM. 
BONNIE and CLYDE run out into the living room, camera going with them. 
BONNIE (to all) Quiet!  I'll get it. 
BONNIE goes down the stairs and reaches the front door. 
BONNIE Who is it? 
VOICE Groceries, M'am. 
EXT. GARAGE APARTMENT. 
She opens the door.  A young man is there with the two big sacks of groceries. 
BONNIE How much? 
YOUNG MAN Six dollars and forty-three cents. 
BONNIE pays him and goes to take the bags from him. 
YOUNG MAN Here, M'am, them bags is heavy. Let me carry 'em up for you. 
BONNIE (curtly) No thanks, I'll take 'em. 
She takes the heavy bags and hefts them up and turns and walks up the stairs.  They are obviously very heavy for her. Closeup the delivery boy's face, looking puzzled at this behavior.  BONNIE reaches the top steps, and voices are heard. 
BUCK'S VOICE What was it? 
CLYDE'S VOICE Quiet.  Open the door. 
BONNIE C'mon, c'mon... 
Close-up.  The DELIVERY BOY.  A look of suspicion comes across his face. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. GARAGE APARTMENT. 
Close-up of BONNIE--seated in the living room. 
BONNIE (reading from a pad; in a recital voice) It's called "The Ballad of Suicide Sal." (she pauses for effect; then begins:) "We each of us have a good alibi For being down here in the 'joint'; But few of them really are justified If you get right down to the point. You've heard of a woman's glory Being spent on a downright cur'." 
BUCK'S VOICE (O.S.) You write that all by yourself? 
BONNIE You want to hear this or not? 
As she reads, the camera pans around the room picking out everyone's reaction.  CLYDE is looking and listening seriously.  BUCK is grinning.  C.W. is blank.  BLANCHE is in the kitchen cooking. 
BONNIE "Still you can't always judge the story As true, being told by her. Now 'Sal' was a gal of rare beauty, Though her features were coarse and tough--" 
BUCK Yeah, I knew her.  She was cockeyed and had a hare-lip and no teeth! 
BONNIE flashes him a look that could kill.  He shuts up fast. She continues: 
BONNIE "Now 'Sal' was a gal of rare beauty, Though her features were coarse and tough; She never once faltered from duty To play on the 'up and up'." 
Still listening, CLYDE gets up from his chair and walks slowly past the living room windows.  The camera angled slightly above him, sees down the street.  We see two police cars quietly pulling up.  One of them parks sideways in the driveway to block escape from the garage, the other stays on the street.  CLYDE turns and looks out the window. 
BONNIE (o.s. as we see out the window) "Sal told me this tale on the evening Before she was turned out free, And I'll do my best to relate it Just as she told it to me--" 
CLYDE (seeing it) It's the law. 
As soon as CLYDE calls out, BLANCHE drops the frying pan on the floor and begins screaming.  Camera cuts back to the living room.  Everyone else leaps into action.  Guns begin blazing from everywhere; we rarely see who is shooting at whom. 
EXT. GARAGE APARTMENT.  DAY.

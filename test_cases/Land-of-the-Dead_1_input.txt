BLACK. THE SOUND OF CHANNELS BEING TURNED ON A TV. TITLE UP: 
"SOME TIME AGO". 
NEWSCASTER (O.S.) 
It's hard for us here to believe what we're reporting to you, but it does seem to be a fact. CLICK! In a corner of the BLACK SCREEN, A SMALL TV APPEARS. On it, in BLACK & WHITE, A NEWSCASTER sits at an anchor desk. 
NEWSCASTER (O.S.) 
Bodies of the recently dead are returning to life and attacking the living. CLICK! With each CLICK, the TV disappears, then reappears in a new position ON SCREEN. CREDITS ROLL in the surrounding 
BLACK. 
NEWSCASTER (O.S.) 
Murder victims have shown signs of having been partially devoured by their murderers. CLICK! ANOTHER NEWSCASTER is on the TV now, sitting in a more modern studio. The broadcast remains in BLACK & WHITE. 
SECOND NEWSCASTER 
Because of the obvious threat to 
untold numbers of citizens, due to the crisis that is now developing this radio station will 
remain on the air day and night. 
CLICK! The second newscaster looks more and more dishevelled. 
SECOND NEWSCASTER (O.S.) 
It has been established that persons who have recently died have been returning to life and eating the flesh of the living. 
CLICK! 
SECOND NEWSCASTER (O.S.) 
We must not be lulled by the concept that these are our family members or our friends. They are not. They must be destroyed on sight. CLICK! A THIRD NEWSCASTER, more haggard than the others, sits at an ANCHOR DESK on a barren set, still in BLACK & WHITE. 
THIRD NEWSCASTER (O.S.) 
Every dead body that is not exterminated becomes one of them. It gets up and kills. The people it kills get up and kill. They kill for one reason. They kill for food. 
CLICK! 
THIRD NEWSCASTER (O.S.) 
If this situation is allowed to continue, there will be nothing left. Nothing. 
CLICK! 
THIRD NEWSCASTER (CONT'D) 
It's over. Finished. Finished. It's their world now. 
CLICK! IN ABSOLUTE BLACK, A SINGLE WORD FADES UP: "TODAY". A 
SOUND FADES IN TOO. TCHICK! KA-TCHICK-TCHICKY-TCHICK! Soft. Metallic. It makes us nervous. 
EXT. UNIONTOWN - NIGHT 
IN COLOR: A FULL MOON shines over a picture-perfect American town. PEOPLE, seen in SILHOUETTE, stroll past quaint shops whose signs promise RELIABLE APPLIANCES, WELL-MADE CLOTHES, SOLID VALUES. A DINER has a neon sign that offers the "BEST EATS IN TOWN". But something is wrong. The neon isn't lit. Nothing in town is lit. Street lamps, windows, are all dark. TCHICK! KA-TCHICK-TCHICK. That DISTURBING SOUND continues. 
Some of the PEDESTRIANS drift into "UNIONTOWN PARK", milling around a GAZEBO, where THREE "MUSICIANS" are struggling with a trombone, a saxophone, and a tambourine. They can't seem to make the instruments work, except for the tambourine player, who is rattling out a few very unrhythmic beats. That's where that sound is coming from. TCHICK! KA-TCHICK-TCHICKY-TCHICK. A CLOSER INSPECTION REVEALS: The "MUSICIANS" are DEAD. So are the "PEDESTRIANS". Flesh is rotting off their bones. The town itself, which at first looked so perfect, is ROTTING TOO. 
MIKE (O.S.) 
They're trying to be us. 
RILEY (O.S.) 
They used to be us.

EXT. HILLTOP ABOVE UNIONTOWN - NIGHT 
RILEY 
(Worried) They're learning how to be us again. RILEY DENBO watches the town through binoculars. 32, made rugged by realities, he has a heart beneath his tough exterior. MIKE CONVERSE, 21, young and unseasoned, has the eagerness and passion of someone young and unseasoned.

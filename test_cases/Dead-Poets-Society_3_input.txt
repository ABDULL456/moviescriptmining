Todd opens his eyes and sees Charlie's face 
TODD What is it? 
Todd looks over to see Pitts, Meeks, and Knox by the door. 
CHARLIE Neil's dead. 
EXT. CAMPUS - DAY 
It is a snowy, overcast morning. Todd walks through the snow. He has his coat on over his pyjamas. The other boys follow closely behind him as he walks down towards the water. He stops and stares out at the snow-covered surroundings. 
TODD It's so beautiful. 
Todd begins to gag and then goes down on his knees, vomiting into the snow. The other boys huddle around him, hugging him. 
CHARLIE Todd. It's okay, Todd. 
PITTS Calm down. 
CHARLIE It's all right, Todd. 
PITTS Todd, it's okay. It's okay, Todd. 
CHARLIE It's all right. It's alright. 
Charlie grabs a handful of snow and wipes Todd's mouth with it. 
TODD He wouldn't-- He wouldn't have done it. 
MEEKS You can't explain it, Todd. 
TODD It was his father! 
CHARLIE No! 
TODD He wouldn't have left us. It's because he- He wouldn't have. His dad was-- his, his father did it. 
CHARLIE Todd. 
TODD His father killed him. He made him do it. 
MEEKS You can't explain it, Todd. 
Todd pushes himself away from the boys and stumbles down the hill, slipping and falling in the snow. 
MEEKS Todd! 
CHARLIE Leave him be. 
The boys watch as Todd runs down towards the dock by the river, yelling and crying. He finally seems to regain control of himself and walks in silence out onto the dock. 
INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY 
Keating sits by himself at his desk. After a moment he gets up and walks over to Neil's desk. Opening it, he finds his copy of "Five Centuries of Verse" and flips through the first few pages. Sitting down at the desk, he returns to the opening page, reading the opening verse written there. Keating begins to sob, then closes the book. 
INT. ASSEMBLY HALL - DAY 
A church service is going on. The boys have joined in the other students in a hymn. Charlie is the only one not singing. He stares off into nothingness. 
BOYS (singing) All my life Thy light shall surely follow me And in God's house forevermore My dwelling place shall be Amen. 
Mr. Nolan stands at the pulpit, with the rest of the professors seated behind him. 
MR. NOLAN The death of Neil Perry is a tragedy. He was a fine student. One of Welton's best. And he will be missed. We've contacted each of your parents to explain the situation. Naturally, they're all quite concerned. At the request of Neil's family, I intend to conduct a thorough inquiry into this matter. Your complete cooperation is expected. 
INT. CLOAKROOM - DAY 
The boys (except Cameron) are sitting about the cluttered room waiting. Charlie lights a cigarette. 
CHARLIE You told him about this meeting? 
PITTS Twice. 
CHARLIE That's it, guys. We're all fried. 
PITTS How do you mean? 
CHARLIE Cameron's a fink. He's in Nolan's office right now, finking.

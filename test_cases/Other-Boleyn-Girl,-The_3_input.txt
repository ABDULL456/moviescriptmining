BRANDON ...another lie. That honour would have to go to the Germans. 
HENRY What of our painters, then? 
RANDON Years behind their Italian counterparts. The truth is far from leading the world, we're a provincial outpost, lagging far behind. 
HENRY What? Is no one proud to be English? (turns to ANNE) Anne? What say you? 
ANNE gulps. The clanking of cutlery. All eyes on her. 
ANNE Me, my Lord? clears throat) I know little of such matters, but I've not heard mention of our armies. Undefeated, I believe, in a generation. 
ENRY Well said. 
ANNE Or our navy? The finest in the world. 
HENRY It's true. 
ANNE The universities in Spain and the philosophers in Germany may be strong, but are they really the equal of Oxford and Thomas More? 
HENRY Never! 
ANNE I doubt there is a country that is fairer in Government, or better protected by nature from her enemies, whose people are happier or more prosperous..

EXT. HEVER CASTLE - STABLE YARD - DAY

t's a scene of great activity, excitement, and anticipation. 
The MASTER OF THE HORSE helps HENRY mount his steed - the biggest and most glamorous stallion of all, with wonderful, ornate saddlery.

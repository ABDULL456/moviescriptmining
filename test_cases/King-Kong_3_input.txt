A RUMBLING, BESTIAL ROAR fills the VILLAGE as if in answer to ANN'S CRY ... LOUD and CLOSE ... for a brief moment everyone freezes ... F AST ACTION: NATIVE MEN emerge as if from NOWHERE ... before anyone can react, they are roughly SHOVED and PULLED into the MIDST of the FURIOUS NATIVE MOB. 
In the SHADOWS the agitated WOMEN of the VILLAGE start rocking and wailing in unison. 
IMAGES: STRANGE FACES, smeared with MUD ... SCREECHING MOUTHS. BRUCE is HELD BACK by SEVERAL NATIVES as he struggles. JACK pulls ANN close to him, trying to protect her. ANN is wrenched from him ... 
She struggles against her captors ... 
ANGLE ON: A OLD-WOMAN moves through the midst of the VILLAGERS ... her gaze fixed on ANN, muttering curses, eyes burning with a dark fury ... 
DENHAM is YELLING at the NATIVES ... he is SHOVED to the GROUND. 
The NATIVES SHRIEK. One of the SAILORS is DRAGGED forward, his HEAD pushed against a FLAT STONE SLAB, and CLUBBED TO DEATH. 
ANGLE ON: In the midst of the CONFUSION, JACK sees the          OLD SHA-WOMAN screaming at ANN. She starts chanting with rising HYSTERICS ... 
SHA-WOMAN (chanting) Larri yu sano korê ... Kweh yonê kah`weh ad-larr ... torê Kông. 
CLOSE ON: JACK struggles, fists flying - he is clubbed and DROPS like a stone. 
ANN SCREAMS ... the BEAST ROARS in the DISTANCE! 
DENHAM punches a NATIVE ... they haul him forward and thrust his HEAD onto the BLOOD SPLATTERED STONE ... NATIVE CLUBS rise into the air ... 
.. a GUNSHOT! 
The NATIVES hesitate, as if STUNNED ... then SCATTER. 
ENGLEHORN, HAYES and an ARMED GROUP of SAILORS race into the VILLAGE! 
ENGLEHORN roughly hauls DENHAM to his feet. 
ENGLEHORN Seen enough?

EXT. VENTURE DECK - NIGHT

ENGLEHORN (yelling) Lighten the ship! Anything that's not bolted down goes overboard! 
ANGLES ON: As WAVES crash against the STRANDED SHIP, LUMPY, JIMMY, CHOY and the other SAILORS throw TABLES, CHESTS ... KITCHEN EQUIPMENT into the SEA. 
INT.   DENHAM'S CABIN - NIGHT 
DENHAM is swigging from a HIP FLASK. HERB and PRESTON are gathered gloomily around a TABLE, while DENHAM strides around the ROOM, swigging and talking in a animated fashion. The STORM BATTERS and CRASHES outside. 
DENHAM We got away. We gotta be grateful for that gentlemen. 
PRESTON What about Mike? He didn't get away - he's still there! 
DENHAM (sharply) Mike died doing what he believed in! He didn't die for nothing. And I'll tell you something else - I'm going to finish this film - for Mike. 
I'm going to NHAM(cont'd) donate the DE finish it and proceeds to his wife and kids - because that man is a hero and he deserves nothing less! 
HERB Hear! Hear! 
INT. ANN'S CABIN - NIGHT 
ANN alone in her CABIN, is overwhelmed by a terrible SENSE of FOREBODING ... 
SUDDENLY! A WAVE crashes against her WINDOW! SHE SPINS AROUND IN FRIGHT. 
As she turns slowly she catches sight of her terrified reflection in the MIRROR. 
EXT. ROCKS - NIGHT

NGLE ON: A SKULL ISLANDER LANDS on the BACK DECK of the VENTURE UNSEEN! He CROUCHES in the shadows ... 
INT. MESS ROOM - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON: JACK sprawled on a BENCH SEAT in the MESS ... a LOUD METALLIC CREAK wakes him up. He rolls over, tries to focus ... he touches his hand to the back of his HEAD ... when he withdraws his hand ... his fingers are covered in BLOOD. 
SUDDENLY LUMPY and a SAILOR pick the TABLE up from under him and carry it outside. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ANN'S CABIN - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON: ANN, a sense of foreboding... 
EXT. VENTURE DECK - NIGHT 
ANGLE ON: JACK staggers on to the BACK DECK, clutching a railing to steady himself. He suddenly discovers a NATIVE NECKLACE on the DECK ... 
... JACK stares at the NECKLACE, decorated with a MONKEY SKULL, a look of HORRIFIED REALIZATION growing. JIMMY is racing past, JACK grabs him: 
JACK Where's Ann? 
JIMMY She went to her cabin.

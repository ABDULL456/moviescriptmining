DARNELL Bullshit. You meant it. I wouldn't be standing here now, everybody thinkin' I'm a stupid asshole, if I didn't know you meant it. I wanna see you, Autumn. Not in study hall. Not like your student. Like somebody to be taken seriously. 
AUTUMN I do take you seriously, Darnell, but I'm still with Ray. I can't just go paradin' around town. 
DARNELL I don't need to go paradin'. We'll go someplace different. Someplace nobody'll see us. 
She looks at him a long beat. She doesn't need this complication, this conflict, but she can't say no. 
AUTUMN God, why am I even considering this? 
The song ends. Ray moves in to reclaim her. 
RAY (to Darnell) All caught up on your arithmetic? 
Darnell, pissed, gives Ray a shove. 
DARNELL Yeh, you only gained 37 yards on 12 carries. 
Ray lunges back at him, but quickly several players, led by Joe and Bud Lite, step between them. Darnell shrugs them off and leaves the party. 
JOE (to Bud Lite) Just what we need, a little team unity. 
Ray takes Autumn's arm, pulls her out onto the patio. 
RAY I'm gettin' a little sick of this asshole, Autumn. I don't like you hangin' out with him. It's embarrassing. 
AUTUMN I don't hang out with him. I tutor him. 
RAY Then have him get another tutor. 
AUTUMN I can't do that. I made a commitment to help him pass his qualifying exam. I can't bail out on him now. 
RAY What the hell difference does it makes? They'll grease him through no matter what he does. Nobody's ever gonna see his graduation. Don't tell me you're falling for this guy. He's just another gang-banger with speed. 
AUTUMN I just said I wanted to help him. What are you more afraid of, losing your girl or your position? 
RAY Maybe you oughta think about what you're in danger of losing. 
AUTUMN Maybe I will. 
Autumn rips free of his grip, and walks out of the party too. 
EXT. CAMPUS - NIGHT 
Darnell sits alone on a bench under an old Willow, just staring out at the night. He hears a voice behind him. 
VOICE (V.O.) So where you wanna go? 
He turns. It's Autumn. 
INT. FRATERNITY HOUSE - NIGHT 
The party's still in full gear. Ray is now chatting up a few of the groupies. Joe and Bud Lite sit off in a corner. Joe's knocked back several beers. He's a little tipsy, and lost in thought. 
JOE Maybe she's out with some guy. 
BUD Who? Camille? I don't think she's the type to screw around on ya. Shoot ya, maybe... 
JOE It wouldn't be screwing around. It's not like we're going together. 
Joe's gaze falls on a sultry brunette, SHERI, at a table across the way. She's eyeing Joe big time. She wants him. He stares back at her. She doesn't blink. 
EXT. CAMPUS LIBRARY - NIGHT 
Camille, carrying an armload of books, comes down the library steps, having been studying late. As she heads for her dorm, she sees Joe and Sheri going across the Quad; Sheri draped around Joe, nuzzling him. 
Joe looks over, spots Camille, stops; surprised, embarrassed to see her. They exchange a look. Camille, upset, turns and wheels off. Joe wants to say something to her, but can't get it out. 
ON DARNELL AND AUTUMN 
We don't know where yet, but they seem to be slipping and sliding, clutching on to each other. 
AUTUMN You're right, nobody would ever see us here. 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL

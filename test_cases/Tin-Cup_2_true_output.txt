TIN CUP Goin' to the U.S. Open with the shanks. Gonna be chili dipping my way around the course on worldwide television... sure, relax. 
ROMEO I'm gonna get rid of them shanks for ya. No hay problema. 
TIN CUP Molly and I are circling each other... I can feel it... 
ROMEO She the enemy, boss. 
TIN CUP Naw... 
ROMEO Well she wakin' up with the enemy -- same thing. 
TIN CUP Tell me something, Romes -- the absolute truth -- you think I can go 72 holes without falling apart. 
Romeo keeps driving, pretends not to hear. 
TIN CUP You heard me! I don't want no bullshit... do you think I can do it? 
ROMEO I don't know, boss, I just don't know. 
And Tin Cup puts on his Walkman, and stares out the window endlessly at a thousand miles of passing scenery, to the MUSIC of GEORGE JONES... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
86   EXT. DESERT - DAY                                             86 
The WINNEBAGO RUMBLES out of the country heading east, and -- 
DISSOLVE TO: 
87   EXT. CENTRAL TEXAS PLAINS - DAY                               87 
The Winnebago heads out of the high plains. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
89   EXT. PINE HILLS GOLF CLUB (NORTH CAROLINA) - DAY              89 
The Winnebago passes through a "tunnel" of tall, old pines into a cathedral environment of old money and old golf. 
90   INT. WINNEBAGO - DAY                                          90 
Romeo and Tin Cup stare out into the trees, the lushness -- a couple of wide-eyed kids. 
TIN CUP I bet this is the first Winnebago they ever saw here... 
ROMEO Yeah... and the first Mexican... 
The Winnebago pulls up to a guard gate -- A SECURITY GUARD comes to the window. A banner hangs above the entrance a few paces past the security gate, proclaiming: "Old Pines -- U.S. Open Championship." 
SECURITY GUARD Yes? 
ROMEO Como esta, amigo. I have with me one of the legendary ball strikers in the history of golf -- 
The Security Guard strains to see in. 
SECURITY GUARD Who's that? Mr. Crenshaw? That you? Mr. Price, Mr. Norman? No? 
Tin Cup leans across Romeo to introduce himself. 
TIN CUP Roy 'Tin Cup' McAvoy. Representing the great American Southwest. 
The Guard backs off quickly, turns to his SECOND. 
SECURITY GUARD Do we have a... McCormack... on the list. 
ROMEO McAvoy -- Roy McAvoy -- he's a legend! 
SECURITY GUARD We got over 150 legends in this tournament. Sorry. 
Romeo starts cursing in Spanish.   The Guard is unphased. 
SECURITY GUARD Call the police. 
ROMEO Police? 
The police quickly appear to take over the situation. Tin Cup leaps out of the Winnebago to argue his point. 
TIN CUP There's a mistake here, fellas! 
A COP grabs Tin Cup and Roy is ready to fight.   It's getting ugly real fast. 
COP We'll throw your ass in jail right now, pal -- there's a lotta lunatics here and we don't take chances... 
At that moment David Simms pulls in, driving a con- vertible sponsor's car. He sees the scuffle, gets out. 
SIMMS What's the problem here? 
SECURITY GUARD This clown says he's in the Open... 
Simms spots Tin Cup -- a delicious moment for him. Tin Cup wants to hide but he just gamely covers his face. 
TIN CUP Hiya, David... nice sweater. 
SECURITY GUARD He's not on the list. 
Simms takes the clipboard with the list.

INT. VINCE'S OFFICE - DAY 
Vince is on the telephone in his office at the Moonlight Hotel and Casino.  He clearly has a new mistress or two. 
VINCE (very seductive) Baby, you know I do... of course... I feel it too... I'm blushing... can you hold? 
A second telephone RINGS, and Willy answers it.  Vince meanwhile has pushed a button on his phone and is involved in a second romantic call. 
VINCE Soon, you gorgeous thing... tell me... how lonely? 
WILLY It's that call you were expecting, Vince. 
VINCE Can you hold?  Can you try? 
Willy passes the phone to Vince. t

VINCE Have you found out where Christy is yet? Hey, bozo, you re on my payroll! You want to try making it on a cop's salary?  Find her, and find her now! 
Vince passes the phone back to Willy. 
VINCE Raise the ante to three hundred grand. 
Willy heads for the fax machine.  Vince regains his composure, and picks up his own phone; he pushes a button. 
VINCE Sorry, baby... you are?  Totally?  Not a stitch?... Yeah, I'm naked too... inside... 
INT. CONVENT CRAFTS ROOM 
This is a large, open room where the nuns create various gift items which the convent sells to support itself. Several nuns sit at a table, diligently hand-painting Christmas cards and making Christmas tree ornaments. 
On the other side of the room is a large, free-standing loom, which resembles a grand piano.  The loom is wooden; a tapestry is half-completed.  Mary Patrick is seated at the loom, which is a complicated mechanism.  Christy stands beside her. 
MARY PATRICK The minute I saw you. I said to myself, she's a weaver.  Have you ever used a loom? 
CHRISTY Not in years. 
MARY PATRICK Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy.  I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent. 
CHRISTY Why? 
MARY PATRICK To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money. 
CHRISTY But don't you get money?  From the Vatican?

MARY PATRICK Mary Clarence.  Goose.  We're completely self-supporting.  Like all convents. Like yours. 
CHRISTY Oh, right.  At my old place, we used to... wash cars.  Groom dogs.  So... nice loom. 
MARY PATRICK Isn't it lovely?  Now I'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in. (as she deftly works the loom) You just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed.  Then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed.  Shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed.  Keep tension on the warp.  Is that clear? 
CHRISTY (pretending to be fascinated) Just about.  Show me again. 
MARY PATRICK You betcha. 
CRAFTS ROOM - AN HOUR LATER 
ANGLE on the wall hanging, which has progressed considerably. 
ANGLE on Christy, leaning against the wall, thumbing through a magazine. 
ANGLE on Mary Patrick, hard at work at the loom. 
MARY PATRICK Shuttle, beat, shed.  And watch your heddles. 
CHRISTY I love my heddles.  Show me again. 
Mother Superior appears. 
MOTHER SUPERIOR Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving progressing? 
MARY PATRICK Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend Mother - 
Page 45. 
CHRISTY Really catching on. 
MOTHER SUPERIOR Good.  Mary Patrick, I need you in the office.  Mary Clarence, carry on. 
Mother Superior gestures to the loom.  Christy sits at the loom, and waves as Mother Superior and Mary Patrick exit. 
Christy stares at the loom; a look of horror crosses her face.  She has not been paying attention to Mary Patrick's instructions.  She cracks her knuckles, as if she were about to play the piano.  She grabs two parts of the loom, at random.  She moves these parts. 
ANGLE on the loom.  As a result of Christy's movements, the loom collapses, piece by piece.  The tapestry unravels, the many skeins of wool snap, and the mechanical apparatus disintegrates, until finally the entire loom shudders and falls to the floor, as Christy watches, aghast. 
INT. CORRIDOR 
Mother Superior is striding down the hall; she is livid. Christy trails behind her, trying to keep up. 
CHRISTY I'm sorry, I'm not a weaver! 
MOTHER SUPERIOR Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!

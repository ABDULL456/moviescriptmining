BRENDAN Your folks left a car here? TUGGER Yeah. 
BRENDAN Take it and Laura's. (Brendan tosses Tug the keys) I'll go first in yours. 
TUGGER The hell- 
BRENDAN I'll take the scenic route to draw off any tailers. They'll think it's you, they might even radio back that you're alone. Get it? 
TUGGER Mr. Smarts. 
He tosses Brendan his keys. 
BRENDAN Alright. Got a cigarette? 
TUGGER No. I don't smoke. BRENDAN I've seen you smoke. 
TUGGER I don't smoke cigarettes. 
BRENDAN Give me fifteen minutes, then go. 
EXT. TUGGER'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Brendan slides into the black mustang and gutters off into the night. 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
Overlooking a twinkling valley of suburban lights. Brendan talks at a payphone beside the curbed mustang. 
THE BRAIN (on phone) Yeah. 
BRENDAN Alright, I warned you. Can you get the car? 
THE BRAIN Yeah. 
BRENDAN Go to 2014 Clancy, off Pico west of La Grange. Park outside and wait. Laura's inside. She hasn't got a car, but if she blows on foot or gets a pick, tail her. Alright? (silence) Alright? 
THE BRAIN Okay. BRENDAN I'll call you when it gets light. (silence) Thanks, Brain. 
CLICK, Brain hangs up. 
EXT. FRONT OF PIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Brendan pulls the mustang into the driveway, limps up to the front door and knocks. One of the Pin's boys lets him in. 
INT. KITCHEN - SAME 
Crowded with tense looking punks, half dressed like the Pin and half like Tugger. The Pin's mom is shuffling about, pouring them milk. 
INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - SAME 
Several more punks from both camps crowd the hall, and more lean in the darkened doorways. Brendan passes through quickly. 
INT. PIN'S DEN - SAME 
The Pin at his desk, flanked by two of his boys. Tug sits in the center of the room, two of his punks beside him. Brendan saunters between them and leans against the dresser. 
BRENDAN Talk. PIN I want full assurance that any heat from Emily and Dode is gonna be on just you. I don't even want my name pulled in the shindig. Second, you owe me six Cs, no rush, but I want your shake that it'll come home in not too much time. 
Tug's eyes burn, his scar reddens. 
BRENDAN (to Tug) That's square. You did them after all. Lay low it'll blow over. Stick on this, one of you'll dish it to bury the other and you'll both get the rap. As to the six, did you borrow it? 
TUGGER Yeah. 
BRENDAN Then you owe it. Shouldn't need a shake on that. 
Tug looks at the Pin. 
TUGGER Alright to both. 
BRENDAN Good. Let's seal it up and blow for keeps. 
PIN Third thing. The last brick. 
Brendan looks up sharply, taken off guard.

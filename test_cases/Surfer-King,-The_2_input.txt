Page 61 of 81 
The brooms come off their shoulders and are held forward. 
LEAD MARCHER (CONT'D) Company! 
MARCHERS Yes sir. 
LEAD MARCHER Order arms. 
They begin a routine practiced with brooms, in a cadence, clapped by the grounds kids behind them. 
LEAD MARCHER (CONT'D) What do you do if it's wet and not yours? 
MARCHERS (in cadence) Don't touch it! Don't touch it! 
LEAD MARCHER How do you deal with a full can of trash? 
MARCHERS We empty!     We empty! 
LEAD MARCHER Sound off! 
MARCHERS Trash Rats! 
LEAD MARCHER Again! 
MARCHERS Trash Rats! 
LEAD MARCHER Sound off, Trash Rats. 
MARCHERS Trash rats! Trash Rats! 
They stop.     Their brooms are raised over their heads. 
LEAD MARCHER Company!     Brooms Ho! 
They allow their brooms to fall to their right side and march to the trash cans. They pull out bright blue ski masks, a la BLUE MAN GROUP, and pick up the toilet plungers. The lead marcher holds his plunger high and shouts. 
LEAD MARCHER (CONT'D) Company!     Begin! 
He counts a four beat rhythm and they begin a BLUE MAN/STOMP like drum routine with the trash cans.

Two grounds kids in regular grounds uniforms approach holding steel trash can lids by the handles (with gloves). These become drums as well as two of the drummers switch from trash can to can lids using the stick side of the toilet plunger as the drumstick. 
A competition erupts from the left and right sides of the line as they each set a beat and then the other matches. 
Finally, a show of unity as both sides join back into the beat for an ending flourish. 
They pick up their brooms and turn their attention to the kids behind them. They begin to march in place and the seated grounds kids clap for the tempo. 
LEAD MARCHER (CONT'D) (to the seated GROUNDS KIDS) What do you do when the table's a mess? 
GROUNDS KIDS (together) We wipe it! We wipe it! 
LEAD MARCHER What do you do when a toilet's stopped up? 
GROUNDS KIDS We plunge it! We plunge it! 
LEAD MARCHER Sound off!

SCULLY There's some kind of cellular breakdown. It's completely edematous. 
She palpates the spongy skin on the man's face, neck. Unbuttoning the uniform now, seeing: 
SCULLY And there's been no autopsy performed. There's no Y incision here; no internal exam. 
MULDER You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris. 
SCULLY I don't know what killed this man. I'm not sure if anybody else could claim to either. 
Off Mulder's reaction to this: 
CUT TO: 
INT. MORGUE - PATHOLOGY LAB - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER 
The gurney with the fireman is pushed through a pair of swinging doors into the darkened lab. Scully flips the lights on, looking around at the giant facility. 
SCULLY (pushing him) You knew this man didn't die at the bomb site before we got here. 
MULDER I'd been told as much. 
SCULLY You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what? 
MULDER I don't know. But I have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced. 
SCULLY Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here. (beat) I'm in serious violation of medical ethics. 
MULDER We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you? 
Scully stares at Mulder, then back down at the body. How can she refuse, given the finality and the personal appeal of the request? After a moment's hesitation, she turns to the body, and to the tray table of tools nearby. Resigned, if not resolved. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT 
A LEGEND appears: WASHINGTON D.C., DUPONT CIRCLE. 4:00 AM. The street is fairly empty, save for a garbage truck picking up the stacks of green garbage bags laid out on the sidewalks. Then A TAXI turns off a main street, MOVING TOWARDS US. 
INT. WASHINGTON D.C. STREET - TAXI - NIGHT 
OVER MULDER to the street: Where the taxi is moving forward toward a spot where two ARLINGTON PD cruisers are pulled up to the curb. Mulder checks the address he has written down. 
MULDER (to the Cabbie) I think this is it up here. 
EXT. SIDE STREET - NIGHT 
The taxi pulls over and Mulder exits, starting up the steps of a walk up where the door is open. 
INT. KURTZWEIL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
There are UNIFORMED OFFICERS inside, and a DETECTIVE. Mulder steps into an office. FOUR PAIRS of eyes give him the once over. The Detective stepping over to him. 
MULDER Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence? 
DETECTIVE (suspiciously) You got some kind of business with him? 
MULDER I'm looking for him. 
DETECTIVE Looking for him for what? 
Mulder pulls out his ID, flashes it at the Detective. 
DETECTIVE (to his partners) Feds are looking for him, too. (turns to Mulder) Real nice business he's got, huh? 
MULDER What's that? 
DETECTIVE Selling naked pictures of little kids over his computer. 
Mulder nods, though this is news to him. He steps in a little further, noticing a shelf lined with books. Their spines all have the author's name written large: DR. ALVIN KURTZWEIL. 
Mulder picks up one of these books, with the title: THE FOUR HORSEMEN OF THE GLOBAL DOMINATION CONSPIRACY. 
DETECTIVE You looking for him for some other reason? 
MULDER Yeah, I had an appointment for a pelvic examination. 
They stare at Mulder like he's a sicko. He smiles and they break into RAUCOUS LAUGHTER. 
DETECTIVE You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil? 
MULDER No. Don't bother. 
Mulder puts the book back among the others on the shelf. And exits. Onto: 
RESUME EXT. KURTZWEIL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

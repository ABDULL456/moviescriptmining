HAROLD Out!  Out! 
SHUTTLE No matter what you say to me, I still think you're the greatest guy I ever knew. 
HAROLD Out! 
SHUTTLE You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out. 
HAROLD Thank God! 
He propels SHUTTLE out the door and slams it.  He faces PENELOPE and PAUL, speaks with malicious calm. 
HAROLD Well--what have we here?  A family. 
PENELOPE Almost a Christmas scene. 
HAROLD Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye. 
PENELOPE Just one favor. 
HAROLD Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get the baseball team. 
PENELOPE I want you to tell me that you loved me once. 
HAROLD is about to dismiss this request majestically, but PENELOPE cuts him off with a sharp, dangerous warning. 
PENELOPE I mean it!  I must have that, and so must Paul.  Tell him that he was conceived in love, even though you hate me now.  Tell both of us that somewhere is our lives was love. 
HAROLD experiments inwardly with responses of various kinds, obviously saying them to himself, directing himself with his hands.  Nothing quite satisfies him. 
HAROLD Testimonials of that sort are--are beyond my range.  I don't do them well. (sincerely, not liking to fail in any way) That's a failing, I know. 
PENELOPE (accepting this ruefully) I see. 
PAUL I don't care.  I don't care if there was love or not.  That's all right.  I'm going to go to my room and close the door.  I don't want to hear any more. 
PAUL exits wretchedly to his room. 
HAROLD See how you've upset him.  He was so merry and hale before you came home. 
PENELOPE How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room. 
HAROLD He'll play with his rifle, I expect. That will cheer him up. 
PENELOPE Rifle? 
HAROLD I bought him a twenty-two yesterday--on the way home from Hamburger Heaven.  And where is the good doctor?  Have you two feathered a love nest somewhere? 
PENELOPE He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt. 
HAROLD Last I heard, his mother was going alone. 
PENELOPE He's afraid of you, Harold.  He knew you'd want to fight him.  He doesn't know anything about fighting.  He hates pain. 
HAROLD And you, a supposedly healthy woman, do not detest him for his cowardice? 
PENELOPE It seems highly intelligent to me. 
HAROLD What kind of a country has this become?  The men wear beads and refuse to fight--and the woman adore them.  America's days of greatness are over.  It has drunk the blue soup. 
PENELOPE Blue soup? 
HAROLD An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  I sang "Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender. 
PENELOPE Sounds quite beautiful. 
HAROLD (angered) Beautiful, you say?  It wasn't life, it wasn't death--it wasn't anything! (anger still mounting) Beautiful?  Seven years gone-- (snapping his fingers) like that, like that!  Seven years of silliness and random dreams! Seven years of nothingness, when there could have been so much!

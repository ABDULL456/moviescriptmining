BEN A single.  Just for myself, please. 
ROOM CLERK Will you sign the register, please? 
He pushes the card and a pen toward Ben.  Ben writes his name on the card and then stares at it for a moment, crumples it up and fills out a second card. 
ROOM CLERK Is anything wrong, sir? 
BEN What?  No.  Nothing. 
ROOM CLERK (taking a key from behind the counter) Do you have any luggage, Mister -- (looks at registration card) Gladstone? 
BEN Luggage?  Yes.  Yes.  I do. 
ROOM CLERK Where is it? 
BEN What? 
ROOM CLERK Where is your luggage? 
BEN Well it's in the car.  It's out in the car. 
ROOM CLERK Very good, sir.  I'll have a porter bring it in. 
BEN Oh no. 
ROOM CLERK Sir? 
BEN I mean I'd - I'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in.  I just have a toothbrush.  I can get it my- self.  If that's all right. 
ROOM CLERK Of course. 
Ben reaches for the key. 
ROOM CLERK I'll have a porter show you the room. 
BEN Oh.  Well actually, I'd just as soon find it myself.  I just have the toothbrush to carry up and I think I can manage it myself. 
ROOM CLERK Whatever you say, sir. 
He hands Ben the key. 
BEN Thank you. 
56	INT. VERANDA ROOM - NIGHT 
Mrs. Robinson sits, patiently and calmly.  Her face betrays absolutely nothing as she stares ahead of her and sips her martini. 
WAITER No. 1 Mrs. Robinson. 
She looks up.  A waiter is standing next to the table with a telephone. 
MRS. ROBINSON Yes? 
The waiter plugs the phone into the wall socket next to the table and hands her the receiver. 
MRS. ROBINSON Thank you. 
The waiter nods and leaves. 
MRS. ROBINSON (into phone) Hello. 
BEN'S VOICE Mrs. Robinson? 
MRS. ROBINSON Yes? 
BEN'S VOICE It's Benjamin. 
MRS. ROBINSON Yes? 
BEN'S VOICE Benjamin Braddock. 
MRS. ROBINSON Benjamin -- where are you? 
BEN'S VOICE Can you look through the glass. 
Mrs. Robinson turns in her chair and looks through the glass into the lobby. 
57	INT. LOBBY - PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT - WHAT SHE SEES 
Ben is in the phone booth in the lobby no more than twenty feet away. 
BEN'S VOICE Can you see me now? 
MRS. ROBINSON Yes, I can. 
58	INT. LOBBY PHONE BOOTH 
Over Ben's shoulder, we can see his face reflected in the glass door and, through it, Mrs. Robinson sitting in the Veranda Room. 
INTERCUT PHONE CONVERSATION 
BEN I got a single room. 
MRS. ROBINSON That's fine. 
BEN But there's one thing.  The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean - I don't know what their policy is - but - 
MRS. ROBINSON Well - do you want to go up first? 
BEN Yes - I think that would be good. 
MRS. ROBINSON I'll be up in five minutes. 
BEN Well - goodbye then - 
MRS. ROBINSON Benjamin. 
BEN Yes? 
MRS. ROBINSON Isn't there something you want to tell me?

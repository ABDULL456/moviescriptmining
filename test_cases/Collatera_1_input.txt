VINCENT It's not what you owe me. Time is fleeting. Life is short. Time is luck. One day it's gone... (beat) You make it out of this alive, you should call her. That's what I think...anyway... 
It's an important speculation from Vincent, given what's going to come later. And meanwhile...

cruises east. Korean neon burns into the sodium-lit magenta sky. The streets are empty at four a.m. Reflected streetlights flow up the windshield, colors kicking off dented bodywork.

Back rooms - in Korean luxo - are for karaoke or the Korean hotties who hang by a counter, like a check-in area. Panels of glass in semi-circles in front of planting, some with sheets of water running down, separate the different zones. OR...it's cheesy disco with flat screens playing Korean music videos and stock market quotes with out-of-date Christmas decorations and black-lit outer-space murals. Visually, it's as noisy as the Korean hip-hop, which makes it impossible for anybody to hear anything.

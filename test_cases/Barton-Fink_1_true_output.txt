He fills a glass with whiskey and swaps it for the empty glass. 
CHARLIE ...In spite of what you might think from tonight, I'm pretty good at it. 
BARTON Doesn't surprise me at all. 
CHARLIE Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people  that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need  a fella could do worse. 
BARTON Thanks, I'll keep it in mind. 
CHARLIE What kind of scribbler are you  newspaperman did you say? 
BARTON No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now  
CHARLIE Pictures! Jesus! 
He guffaws. 
CHARLIE ...I'm sorry, brother, I was just sitting here thinking I was talking to some ambitious youngster, eager to make good.  Hell, you've got it made! Writing for pictures! Beating out that competition!  And me being patronizing! 
He gestures toward his face: 
CHARLIE ...Is the egg showing or what?! 
BARTON That's okay; actually I am just starting out in the movies  though I was pretty well established in New York, some renown there, 
CHARLIE Oh, it's an exciting time then. I'm not the best-read mug on the planet, so I guess it's no surprise I didn't recognize your name. Jesus, I feel like a heel. 
For the first time Barton smiles. 
BARTON That's okay, Charlie. I'm a playwright. My shows've only played New York. Last one got a hell of a write-up in the Herald. I guess that's why they wanted me here. 
CHARLIE Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality. What kind of venue, that is to say, thematically, uh... 
BARTON What do I write about? 
Charlie laughs. 
CHARLIE Caught me trying to be fancy! Yeah, that's it, Bart. 
BARTON Well, that's a good question. Strange as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I write about people like you. The average working stiff. The common man. 
CHARLIE Well ain't that a kick in the head! 
BARTON Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way, that's exactly the point. There's a few people in New York  hopefully our numbers are growing  who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience, create a theater for the masses that's based on a few simple truths  not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that doesn't hold true today, if they ever did... 
He gazes at Charlie. 
BARTON ...I don't guess this means much to you. 
CHARLIE Hell, I could tell you some stories 
BARTON And that's the point, that we all have stories. The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life  why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater?  Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater. 
CHARLIE I can see you feel pretty strongly about it. 
BARTON Well, I don't mean to get up on my high horse, but why shouldn't we look at ourselves up there?  Who cares about the Fifth Earl of Bastrop and Lady Higginbottom and  and  and who killed Nigel Grinch-Gibbons? 
CHARLIE I can feel my butt getting sore already. 
BARTON Exactly, Charlie! You understand what I'm saying  a lot more than some of these literary types. Because you're a real man! 
CHARLIE And I could tell you some stories  
BARTON Sure you could!  And yet many writers do everything in their power to insulate themselves from the common man  from where they live, from where they trade, from where they fight and love and converse and  and  and... so naturally their work suffers, and regresses into empty formalism and  well, I'm spouting off again, but to put it in your language, the theater becomes as phony as a three dollar bill. 
CHARLIE Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right there. 
BARTON Frequently played, seldom remarked. 
Charlie laughs. 
CHARLIE Whatever that means. 
Barton smiles with him. 
BARTON You're all right, Charlie. I'm glad you stopped by. I'm sorry if  well I know I sometimes run on. 
CHARLIE Hell no! Jesus, I'm the kind of guy, I'll let you know if I'm bored. I find it all pretty damned interesting. I'm the kind schmoe who's generally interested in the other guy's point of view. 
BARTON Well, we've got something in common then. 
Charlie is getting to his feet and walking to the door. 
CHARLIE Well Christ, if there's any way I can contribute, or help, or whatever 
Barton chuckles and extends his hand. 
BARTON Sure, sure Charlie, you can help by just being yourself. 
CHARLIE Well, I can tell you some stories  
He pumps Barton's hand, then turns and pauses in the doorway.

The Captain is teaching him lesson. \nGENERAL SLATER (FROWNS) What's your outfit, Sergeant? \nGALOVITCH Company G, 219th, Sir. \nThe General, still frowning slightly, nods. He signals his driver to move on. The jeep starts down the road. Galovitch gets on his bicycle. Prew starts hiking again. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - DAY \nMEDIUM SHOT Prew and Galovitch are standing in front of the Captain's desk. Prew is at attention, the heavy pack on his back; his face is drawn and tired; his clothes are plastered to him. He has regained his old expressionless look. Warden has swung his chair around and is surveying the scene. Holmes looks \nPrew up and down, half-smiles. \nHOLMES I take it you're ready to apologize to Sergeant Galovitch now. \nPREW No, sir, I'm not. \nHolmes' face sets; he jerks his head toward the window. \nHOLMES Take him back up there again, Galovitch. He hasn't had enough yet. \nGALOVITCH (nods unhappily, sick of BICYCLING) Yes, air. \nPrew about-faces and goes out. Galovitch follows. \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT FEATURING WARDEN HOLMES IN B.G. Warden watches Prew go out, then looks toward Holmes whose back is to him. Disgust is reflected on his face. \nMEDIUM SHOT WARDEN AND HOLMES Holmes slams his fist on his desk. \nHOLMES 1 know that kind of man! He's an againster. A bitter-ender. You can't be decent to a man like that. You have to tame him, like an animal! (TO WARDEN) Warden, I want you to prepare court martial papers. Insubordination and insolence to an officer. \nWARDEN Yes, sir. \nWarden swings around to his own desk. He thinks for several moments, tries to sound quite casual. \nWARDEN Too bad you got to lose a middleweight like that... \nHOLMES Why? Do you see any other way of breaking him? \nWARDEN I don't know... But even if he only gets three months, he'll still be in the Stockade when the boxing finals come up. \nHe looks over at Holmes, sees him scowling, weakening. \nWARDEN How about just giving him a good stiff Compny punishment for now? \nHolmes ponders the situation unhappily, rubs his hand over his face,. shakes his head as if the whole thing is too much for him. \nHOLMES All right, all right. But throw the book at him. \nWARDEN (pleased but impassive) Yes, sir. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. WARDEN'S ROOM OFF SQUAD ROCK - NIGHT \nCLOSE SHOT WARDEN SHOOTING INTO SMALL MIRROR He is trimming his moustache. \nWARDEN I'm sick of it! They ain't got no right to keep breakin it off in that kid! Sooner later Holmes is going to hound him right into the Stockade! \nCAMERA PULLS BACK, REVEALING Karelsen across the room, undressing tiredly, achingly. Warden is sharp and blustering, using Karelsen as an escape valve. During following he goes to his footlocker, opens it, takes out whisky bottle, drinks. \nWARDEN I'm through! I'm turnin in my stripes. I mean it, Pete. I could transfer out tomorrow. In Grade -- get that? To half a dozen Compnys in this Regmint! \nKARELSEN Oh, sure. I could be Chief of Staff, too, except I can't stand leaving all my old buddies. \nKarelsen is naked now except for a bath towel knotted around his middle. He slips his feet into Japanese-style, wooden clogs, starts slowly for the door. \nWARDEN Where you going, Little Sir Echo? \nKARELSEN To take my stinkin shower, if the First Sergeant's got no objections. Where'd you think? To the movies in this towel? \nWARDEN (GRINS) Hurry up. Let's go over to Choy's for some beer and tear up all the tables and chairs. \nKARELSEN (smiles, moves faster) Okay, Okay. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. CHOY'S - NIGHT \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT OLD CHOY An aged Chinese, at least seventy-five, OLD CHOY has a long white beard and wears a black skull cap and an embroidered robe. He is motionless, surveying the pandemonium which we hear over shot: the sounds of men laughing, talking and shouting blend with jukebox music blasting Chattanooga, Choo Choo. YOUNG CHOP, Old Choy's son, passes; he is thirty, white- aproned, bustling, Americanized. CAMERA PANS WITH him, DISCLOSING the small beer-house; it has unpainted cement walls and a cement floor; the only thing that might be called decorative is the jukebox. The place is crowded with men from Schofield, a raucous assemblage; everyone is drinking beer and the smoke hangs in thick layers. At a table near the door sit Prew, Maggio, Clark, Anderson, Treadwell and Mazzioli. At a corner table behind a forest of beer bottles and cans are Warden, Stark, Karelsen and Chief Choate. \nGROUP SHOT WARDEN'S TABLE \nSTARK ... China's the place. Your money's worth ten, twelves times as much. I'm gunna ship over soon as my time's up in this pineapple Army. \nKARELSEN (pinching beer off his NOSE) The Canal Zone for me. This girl down there. She was a planter's daughter, see. She lived a very sheltered life. A very moral young lady, Milt. I took her out to a high class dinner and then dancing. It was a great shock to her to learn about life. But she took it well. She got to like me very much after that. \nWARDEN The last time I heard it you told it different. \nKARELSEN Well, what did you expect? I was in a different mood, then. \n", "test1_true": "MAZZIOLI ... it's in regulations. You've got a right to complain. You've got a right to take your case to the Inspector General. Any soldier has, even a plain dogface. \nPREW I know it. I'm not complainin to nobody. They ain't goin to get the satisfaction of seein me squirm. \nClark begins to play the bugle softly along with the jukebox music, noodling an uninspired obligato. \nMAGGIO (pointing to pictures) ... believe it nor not, this is one soljer who's got a family -- look, fifteen of 'em. (MORE) MAGGIO(CONT'D) See that old man with the handlebars? (PROUDLY) Mr. Maggio is my father. \nMAZZIOLI Listen, Prew. I guess I ought not to tell you but --. Warden hasn't had you on KP much lately, has he? \nPREW Only my reglar turn. \nMAZZIOLI Well -- I was working in the Orderly Room this afternoon and I heard the Captain telling Warden you're to pull KP every weekend from now on. You know what that means -- you can' t even go into TOWN -- \nPREW Whadda they want? They done everything, now they look me in a box! What else they gonna try? \nClark hits a sour note an the bugle. \nPREW (SAVAGELY) When you gonna learn to play a bugle!? \nIn overwhelming, uncontrollable protest, Prew slaps the bugle away from Clark's mouth. In one motion he wipes the mouthpiece on his sleeve, raises it to his lips and blows his own wild, violent obligato to the jukebox music. \nFULL SHOT CHOY'S as Prew plays on, the bugle's pure tone pealing through the room. Everyone puts down his beer, stops talking and turns toward Prew. \nCLOSE SHOT WARDEN reacting. He frowns, moved by the cry behind the music. \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT PREW'S TABLE FEATURING MAGGIO as he watches and listens, an exultation for his friend nakedly revealed on his face. \nANOTHER ANGLE PREW'S TABLE FEATURING PREW Hitting an almost impossibly high note, he stops as suddenly as he has begun. He has played perhaps fifteen seconds in \nall. He puts the bugle down on the table, embarrassed now, the violence gone, some of the wrath unloaded. \nMEDIUM SHOT AT DOOR The room is quiet for several moments, except for the continuing jukebox music, which sounds pale and thin now. Fatso Judson strolls in, stands at the door. Some of the men see him, but no one greets him. Fatso threads his way between tables as the room slowly begins to return to normal and the men turn back to their beer. \nMEDIUM SHOT PREW'S TABLE as Fatso passes. He stops, leans over Anderson's shoulder to look at the snapshots on the table. He points to one picture, a pretty young girl of about fifteen, posing Hollywoodishly in a bathing suit, cracks his knuckles loudly. \nFATSO Who's that? Who's that dame? \nMAGGIO (IMPASSIVELY) My sister. \nFatso whistles. He picks up the photograph, stares at it, whistles again. \nFATSO Whoever! Say, she's a real good piece of whistle bait! I'd sure like to get my mitts around her. \nHe laughs complacently at his own wit, tosses the picture on the table, starts to move on, Maggio rises, picks up the heavy wooden stool he's been sitting on and smashes it down on Fatso's head with all his strength, \nANOTHER ANGLE as again the laughing and shouting in the room stops abruptly. Fatso reels a little with the terrible blow but does not go down. \nFATSO Why, holy -- I You hit met You hit me! \nMAGGIO (CALMLY) You bet your life. (RAISES STOOL) And about to do it again. \nFATSO (still blinking from the BLOW) What?! But what for? That's no way to fight! (reaches hand to head, brings away blood) Why, you dirty yellow sneaking -- Wop! You yellow little Wop! If that's the way you want to play! \nWith his last sentence, Fatso whips out a knife and snaps open the blade. The blade is at least five inches long. It glints evilly as he raises it. There is a concerted whisking intake of breath from the room. Murder is clear on Fat sots face. \nMEDIUM SHOT NEAR PREW'S TABLE (EXCLUDING WARDEN) Maggio, holding the stool high, backs up a few feet as Fatso advances toward him. Men sprawl away from them. \nSOLDIER'S VOICE Hey, it you want to fight, fight with fists. Take it outsides \nThere is a murmur of agreement from the crowd. A couple of men are about to rise. Fatso whirls toward them. \nFATSO I'm gonna cut this little Wop's heart out. Anybody steps in here, I give it to him first. \nMEDIUM SHOT OLD CHOY AND YOUNG CHOY side by side. Old Choy watches, immobile, his slit eyes almost closed. Young Choy is shaking with fright. \nMEDIUM SHOT FATSO AND MAGGIO Fatso turns toward Maggio, who circles back around the table as the other stalks him. \nMAGGIO (scared but brave; shouts) I'm gunna de-brain ya, Fatso! One step closer an I'm gunna kill ya! \nFatso has his knife poised at his shoulder, ready to strike. Warden comes into shot suddenly. He brandishes a beer bottle wildly, looks like an avenging spirit of authority. \nWARDEN Nobody's gunna do nothin! Anybody's killin anybody around here, it'll be me! \nWarden snatches another beer bottle from a table, now has one in each hand. He steps between Fatso and Maggio. \nFATSO Look outs here, Warden. This a private affair. \nWARDEN No it ain't! This man's in my Compny an I'm responsible for him. And you ain't makin two weeks extra paper work for me by killin him. Nor him you. Put that knife down! \nHe smashes the neck off one of the beer bottles, points the wagged edge at Fatso, roars: \nWARDEN Put it down! \nFatso slowly lowers the knife to his waist, but keeps it pointed towards Maggio and Warden. Warden deliberately turns his back to Fatso, spits his words at Maggio. \nWARDEN Killer! You unweaned punk& Come on, you want some killing, come on! (whirls on Fatso) Come on, barrelbelly. Ain't you comin? \nNeither Fatso nor Maggio moves. \nWARDEN (with mammoth contempt) Killers! You'll get plenty of killing, all right. More than you got the stomach for. You'll be in a war one of these days. When you feel that lead from a sniper's rifle hit you between the eyes, come and tell me how you like it. Killers! (turns to Maggio) Now put down that chair. \nMaggio puts down the stool. Warden turns to Fatso. \nWARDEN Throw that knife on the floor. \n", "test1_id": 1953, "test2_input": "DISSOLVE TO: \nINT. ALMA'S HOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nMEDIUM SHOT PREW AND ALMA Alma is reading a newspaper in b.g. Prew is disheveled and slovenly, needs a shave badly. His face is lined with pain. He is drunk from several days of steady drinking, stone drunk, as if in a trance. He wears crumpled civilian clothes. He is at a table laboriously writing out the Re-enlistment Blues. He finishes writing a stanza and sings softly. \nPREW Slep in the park that Sunday Seen all the folks gain to church Your belly feel so empty When you're left in the lurch -- \nAlma looks up from the paper. \nALMA Here it is -- they're putting it on an inside page already.

Are you listening or not? \nPrew nods blankly. He rises slowly and walks across the room toward Alma. But his eyes are fixed on a whisky bottle on a table beside her. He moves stiffly, favoring his side, his face contorted. He picks up the bottle, pours himself a drink. \nALMA (COLDLY) Are you trying to set a new world's record? \nCLOSE SHOT PREW He smiles faintly, holds the glass high. \nPREW Yeah... To the memory of Robert E. Lee Prewitt, Holder of the New World's Record... \nTWO SHOT PREW AND ALMA \nALMA I want to know what you plan to do. \nPREW Plan to do? When? \nALMA Any time. Now.

He moves back to his table, mumbling. \nPREW ... might ship out on a tramp and go to Mexico and be a cowboy... \nALMA Oh, be sensible! \nPrew sits at the table again, continues to mumble. \nPREW ... I'm goin back to the Compny... soon's my side heals... Goin back under my own power... Goin into the Ordrly Room 'n' say hello, Warden, Private Prewitt reportin... \nALMA (BREAKING) Oh, Prew! Prew! Why did you have to do it? Why did you have to kill that man? \nPrew shakes his head sadly as if he doesn't know the answer. He picks up the paper he has been writing on, sings softly, testing the last couple of lines affectionately. \nPREW Recruitin crews give me the blues Old Re-enlistment Blues... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. MESS HALL - DAY \nFULL SHOT CAMERA FEATURES clock on wall reading 7:52. About half the Company is at breakfast. There is considerable laughter and horseplay. Near the kitchen a dozen men are in the chow line. \nMEDIUM SHOT FEATURING Warden at the NCO table. He rises, carries his plate with him towards the chow line. A sudden, deep-toned, earthquake-like blast shudders through the room. The cups on the tables rattle. Warden stops, cocks his head. The men stop eating, look at each other. \nANDERSON (to the room) Must be dynamitin down to Wheeler Field. \nCHOATE Them engineers mighty ambitious Sunday mornin before eight o'clock. \nThe men resume eating. Warden moves a couple of steps toward the chow line when the second blast hits. It is much heavier and fuller. \nCLOSE SHOT WARDEN He has a hunch about this now. He reaches out to put his plate down, holding it very carefully in both hands. However, he doesn't bother to see if there is anything under it. The plate falls and crashes on the floor a fraction of a second before the third groundswell of blast shakes the room. \nEXT. COMPANY STREET - DAY \nFULL SHOT NEAR MESS HALL A man sprints toward the mess hall, yelling to right and left at the top of his lungs. As he approaches camera we see it is Mazzioli. \nMAZZIOLI The Japs're bombing Wheeler Field! It's the Japs! They're bombing Wheeler Field! The Japs! It's the Japs! I saw the red circles on the wings! \nLONG SHOT SHOOTING UP CIRCLES ON UNDERSIDE OF MOVING PLANE The roar of the plane over shot. \nMOVING SHOT SHOOTING DOWN FROM JAP PLANE PAST PILOT The figure of Mazzioli gets closer and closer as the plane \ndives toward him, machine guns spitting. \nMEDIUM SHOT MAZZIOLI as the Jap plane flashes by close above him. The stones in the pavement pop up. Mazzioli flops on the street. The plane zooms. \nFULL SHOT MESS HALL as the men rush out. In the front ranks are Warden, Karelsen, Stark and Choate, Choate carries his half-filled plate in one hand, a mug of coffee in the other. The men stretch their necks, following the plane. Then they look back up the street, CAMERA PANNING. Far in b.g, a column of black mushrooming to the sky. Warden dashes to Mazzioli. CAMERA MOVES IN to a CLOSE SHOT as Warden bends over him, hoists him to a sitting position. He is extremely gentle. Mazzioli's knee is laid open and is bleeding freely. Warden whips out a handkerchief and starts to apply a tourniquet. \nMEDIUM SHOT Some of the men continue to crane at the sky. A few pick up metal links from the Jap bullets. \nNAIR Say! This'll make me a good souvenir! A bullet from a Jap plane! \nWARDEN This ain't jawbone! This is for record. Theme real bullets that guy was usin. Get inside -- all of ya! \nWarden gets Mazzioli to his feet, turns to first man in group surrounding them.

Then he throws the plate and cup into the street and dives for cover as the terrifyingly loud noise of the Jap planes indicates they are directly overhead. \nINT. DAY ROOM - DAY \nFULL SHOT The men are pouring in from the Company street, all shouting at once. Warden pushes his way through them and jumps up on the pool table. His big voice booms. \nWARDEN All right, all right, you men! Quiet down! Quiet down! It's only a war. Ain't you ever been in a war before? \nThe men begin to quiet down, look to Warden respectfully. Through the scene the heavy earth shudders are felt and heard as bombs hit in the far distance. Also the sound of the strafing planes. \nWARDEN We're gonna organize a fire umbrella defense. I want the non- coms to get BARs and ammunition from the Supply Room and get up on the roof. Henderson, you're in charge of the loading detail. Get movin! \nThe non-coms push out the door. \nTREADWELL Hey, what about me? I been waitin all my life to git to shoot a BAR at somethin! \nWARDEN Okay. It's your life. \nTreadwell hurries after the non-coms. \nWARDEN The rest of you guys - the CQ will unlock the rifle racks. Every man get his rifle and go to his bunk and stay there. And I mean stay there! I'm making each squad leader responsible to keep his men inside. If you have to use a rifle butt to do it, that's okay, too. \nThere are shouts of protest. The men are over the first shock now and beginning to get angry, anxious for action. \nWARDEN You heard me! This ain't no maneuvers. You go runnin around outside you'll get your ears shot off. You want to be heroes, you'll get plenty chances later. You'll probly have Japs in your laps before night. \nSOLDIER What if they bomb us? \nWARDEN You hear a bomb comin, you're free to take off for the brush. But don't worry -- the Japs'll probly drop all their bombs on Pearl Harbor and Hickam. They ain't gonna waste `em on us. So let's can the chatter. We're wastin time. Squad leaders, get `em upstairs! \nSquad leaders begin to herd their men out. Warden jumps off the pool table. Stark and Karelsen come up to him. \nSTARK What you want me to do, First? I got a hangover, but I can still -- \nWARDEN You stick in the kitchen and make a big pot of coffee. No -- make a barrel of coffee. \nKARELSEN I think I could get one of them Japs with a machine gun, Milt. We'll put the tripod over a chimney. And hold her down by the legs. \nWARDEN Whatever you say, Pete. \nThey smile at each other affectionately, then push into the crowd leaving the Day Room. \nEXT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY \nMEDIUM SHOT The non-coma are arguing violently with Leva at the door to the Supply Room. Jap planes are loud overhead. \nLEVA I don't care. I can't issue any live ammunition without a signed order from an officer. \nHENDERSON But there ain't no officers yet, you jerk! Lieutenant Ross lives off the post. \nLEVA (FOLDS ARMS) I'm sorry fellows. Lieutenant Ross give me them orders himself. No signed order, no ammo. And that's all they are to it. \nWarden hurries up to the group. \nDHOM He won't let us have no ammo, Top! \nCHOATE Hats got it locked up. An the keys in his pocket. \nWARDEN Gimme them keys! \nLEVA I can't, Top. I got to obey my orders. No live ammo without a SIGNED -- \nThey flatten against the wall as a Jap plane roars building- high down the street, machine guns flaring. After it passes, they rush back to Lava, \nWARDEN What's the matter? You blind? You see them planes --?! \nLava puts his hand in his pocket protectively, shakes his head. \nLEVA I ain't gonna do it, Top. I -- \nWARDEN Okay. Chief, bust the door down. (TO LEVA) Get the hell out of the way! \nChoate, Henderson and Dhom back up for a run at the door. Leva moves in front of the door. \nWARDEN Go ahead. Bust it down. He'll get out of the way. \nLEVA Remember I warned you. I did my best. \nWARDEN Okay. I'll see you get a medal. \nWarden dashes up the porch steps as Choate, Henderson and Dhom launch themselves at the door. Leva steps aside. The door rattles ponderously, then flies open. The three battering rams careen into the Supply Room. The men standing by cheer and rush in after them. Leva shakes his head grimly. \nINT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY \nFULL SHOT The men are sitting on their bunks, unhappily, holding their rifles. Others who have slept through breakfast are dressing hastily. Warden rushes into the room. The men immediately bark ad-libbed questions at him: \nSOLDIERS (AD LIB) What's the deal, First? Why can't we go up on the roof? Where's the ammo, Top? Are we soljers -- or Boy Scouts? \nWARN (PITILESSLY) Start rollin full field packs! We may have to move out of here. Squad leaders, get `em packin! \nIn b.g. Henderson and others are going up the porch stairs to the roof. They tote BARs and loading clips. Karelsen and two helpers follow with a heavy machine gun and belt boxes. Warden starts for the porch stairs. He is attracted by something, stops, looks out of scene. \n", "test2_id": 1954, "test3_input": "MEDIUM SHOT THORNHILL FROM WARDEN'S POV lying under an empty bunk with three mattresses piled on it. He is in his underwear and a helmet, hugs his rifle. \nMEDIUM SHOT THORNHILL AND WARDEN \nWARDEN You'll catch a cold, Turp. \nTHORNHILL Don't go out there, First Sergeant! You'll be killed! They're shootin it up! You'll be dead! You'll not be alive any more. Don't go out there! \nWARDEN You better put your pants on. \nWarden hits the floor as a plane is heard so loud and low it sounds as if it's coming right into the room. A dotted line of bullets crosses the floor and moves into Warden's and Karelsen's room. Warden jumps up and rushes into the room. \nINT. WARDEN'S ROOM OFF SQUAD ROOM - DAY \nMEDIUM SHOT as Warden runs in. Broken glass lies all over the floor. Bullet holes are stitched across the top of Warden's footlocker. He throws back the lid fiercely. His linen is polka-dotted with holes. He tosses out shirts, shorts, etc., digs underneath them. He pulls out a quart bottle of whisky; it is untouched. Warden smiles with relief. He lifts the bottle to his lips, drinks long and heartily. \nEXT. ROOF OF BARRACKS - DAY \nFULL SHOT ROOF About twenty of Company GIs men, including almost all the non- cams, are on the roof, They are crouched behind the chimneys or down on their knees in the corners. The BARs are propped on the low walls or chimney tops, their muzzles pointed to the sky. \nLONG SHOT SHOOTING FROM ROOF TO SKY Three Jap planes, forming a V, are heading straight for camera. \nFULL SHOT MEN ON ROOF \nDHOM (SHOUTING) Come on, you dirty sons -- \nThe scream of the planes drowns Dhom's voice. There is a tremendous clatter as the men fire. The Jap planes pass, untouched. \nFrom this moment on there is no letup of the noise -- there is a wild cacophony of Jap planes, BARs, Karelsen's machine gun, the deep sound of bombs hitting in the far distance. And Chief Choate, singing the Regimental marching song, loudly and lustily. \nANOTHER ANGLE as Warden comes up on the roof through the skylight. He shouts incoherently at the men. They shout back in a wild cheer. They are like a pack of hungry men enjoying their first big meal in years. In b.g. the Jap V has swung about and heads back. Warden grabs a BAR from the roof. \nCLOSE SHOT FLASH JAP PILOT IN LEAD PLANE grinning as his plane dives, its guns roaring. His silk scarf ripples out behind him. \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT WARDEN firing the BAR, standing, as the Jap planes roar over. He staggers back from the recoil. \nFULL SHOT ROOF The men fire in unison. They rise after the planes pass, shake their fists. Henderson and others of the loading detail appear on the roof, bringing up more ammunition. \nCLOSE SHOT FEATURING WARDEN He lets out a hoarse yell of glee and pride. \"These are my boys. This is my Company,\" it seems to say. The men answer back with a great answering shout. \nANOTHER ANGLE Warden makes a tour of the roof, laughing, exhorting, slapping the men on their buttocks like a quarterback. They respond with tremendous spirit; they are having one hell of a time. We get only a snatch of what Warden is yelling. \nWARDEN -- Don't worry about wasting ammo! Throw your empty clips down into the yard. The loading detail will pick 'em up -- \nThe sound of a bugle blowing insistently is now heard, blending into the rest of the noise. Treadwell runs to the edge of the roof, looks over. \nLONG SHOT SHOOTING FROM ROOF TO QUADRANGLE At the Bugler's post, Friday Clark is sounding a call. \nMEDIUM SHOT ON ROOF Treadwell turns, yells at the men. \nTREADWELL Friday's gone crazy!

LIVING ROOM OF ALMA'S HOUSE - DAY \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT PREW He is lying on a couch in pajamas. He has not shaven, his hair is unkempt. A Radio Announcer is heard over shot. Prew wakens, groggy with hangover and near-delirium, wrestles with the blanket over him. CAMERA PULLS BACK to MEDIUM SHOT, DISCLOSING Alma and Gorgette. They have negligees over their nightgowns, are listening to the radio. The Announcer's voice tries hard to be calm and official but he cannot keep the tremor out of it. (NOTE: Transcripts of the actual broadcast have been requested.) \nRADIO ANNOUNCER'S VOICE ... This is a real attack, not a maneuver. The Japanese are bombing Pearl Harbor. Please keep in your homes. Do not go on the streets. I repeat, this is a real attack. Japanese planes are bombing our naval and army installations. Civilians will remain in their homes. This is a real attack - \nThe Announcer's voice goes on as above. \nPREW (MUTTERS) Oh, those dirty Germans...

Friday Clark is blowing his Cavalry Charge. In b.g. men of the loading detail are scurrying around. Lieutenant Ross runs into shot. CAMERA PANS him across the quadrangle toward the barracks. \nMEDIUM SHOT NEAR BARRACKS Lieutenant Ross is hailed by the loading detail -- about ten men. He grabs a BAR and ammunition from them and runs into the barracks. The loading detail is working feverishly, same carrying ammunition into the barracks, others picking up empty clips as they are thrown from the roof and hustling them toward the Supply Room. \nEXT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY \nMEDIUM SHOT FEATURING LEVA He is working hard, passing out ammunition to members of the loading detail. But he shakes his head dourly as if the whole thing is still very unofficial. \nEXT. ROOF OF BARRACKS - DAY \nFULL SHOT As before, pandemonium -- but controlled and efficient. The men are hoarse from shouting, red-eyed, puffing from excitement and exertion. Two Jap planes swoop past and the full-throated umbrella of fire lets loose. Lieutenant Ross clambers onto the roof, stooping under the burden of the BAR and loading clips. The men greet him with a concerted cheer. \nTWO SHOT LIEUTENANT ROSS AND WARDEN Ross looks around the roof, nods with evident approval, claps Warden on the shoulder. \nDHOM'S VOICE HERE THEY COME, MEN! \n", "test3_true": "KARELSEN (DISGUSTEDLY) Nuts! Led him too tar. \nMEDIUM SHOT as the men on the roof reload.

He yanks the tripod away from his helpers, picks up the gun, stands and swings it after the plane. The recoil staggers him half way across the roof and deposits him on his rear. \nCLOSE SHOT JAP PILOT He jumps in his seat like a man tied to a hot stove, throws up his arms helplessly. \nLONG SHOT OPEN FIELD SHOOTING FROM ROOF The Jap plane bursts into flame and crashes. \nFULL SHOT ON ROOF The men rise as one with an uproarious cheer. They rush to Karelsen, pick him up. Warden lets go with another of his rebel yells. \nWARDEN You got him, Pete! You got him! \nKARELSEN (spits over roof) Ah, nobody'll ever know which of us got that guy. \nANOTHER ANGLE as the men return to their positions. Two planes head for them, pass over as Company G lets go again with everything it has. \nWILSON (pointing after second of THE PLANES) Hey! That last one was one of ours! That was an American plane! \nWARDEN Well, he ain't got no business here. We're takin care of this sector! \nROSS HERE COMES A JAP! \nSHOT SHOOTING FROM ROOF JAP PLANE swooping across the quadrangle about ten feet from the ground. \nEXT. QUADRANGLE - DAY \nMEDIUM SHOT NEAR BUGLER'S POST Friday Clark, blowing the Cavalry Charge madly, abandons the megaphone as he sees the plane coming. He drops on his chest, hugging the bugle. The plane passes. Clark jumps up instantly, resumes blowing the Charge. \nLONG SHOT SHOOTING FROM ROOF JAP PLANE The same plane has gained altitude so that it is a few feet above the barracks as it heads straight for the roof. \nMEDIUM SHOT The men flatten, all but Warden. He stands, swings his BAR toward the plane. CAMERA IS ANGLED so that Warden is silhouetted against the sky as he fires at the Jap plane. \nLONG SHOT JAP PLANE It misses the roof by a foot or two, zooms up at a weird angle. A thick cloud of smoke pours out of the engine. The plane falls off on one wing and crashes into trees at the end of the quadrangle. \nCLOSE SHOT JAP PLANE crashing. The gas-tank explodes. A cloud of fire and black \nsmoke obscures the screen. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. LIVING ROOM OF ALMA'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nMEDIUM SHOT PREW There are improvised blackout curtains over windows and the glass doors. The radio is on, volume low, and an announcer (not the one of the morning) is droning out an account of Pearl Harbor. Prew, still on the couch in his pajamas, looks as if he has just struggled to wakefulness. He listens to the radio for a few moments in confused disbelief. He shakes his head vigorously as if to throw off his grogginess. He shakes his head again, slowly, more knowingly now, nodding as if he remembers something from the broadcast of the morning. Then as if all of it hits him suddenly and fully and terribly he wrenches himself off the couch. He looks around at the dimly lit room. \nPREW Alma! Alma! \nHe goes to the blackout curtains, peeps out. Then he turns back to listen to the radio. Abruptly, he runs into the bedroom. \nPREW'S VOICE Alma! \nThe room remains empty for a few moments as the radio announcer goes on, continuing previous remarks. \nRADIO ANNOUNCER'S VOICE -- ready to fight and die for us, our Regular Army and Navy have this day upheld the faith and confidence we have always placed in them. They have proved their right to the esteem we have always had for them... \nPrew comes back into the room. He has his shoes on, holds civilian shirt and pants in his hand. He starts to put them on hurriedly, his attention still focused on the broadcast. The front door opens and Alma and Gorgette enter. They are surprised to see Prew up. He nods at them, turns back quickly to listen to the radio as he continues dressing. \nRADIO ANNOUNCER'S VOICE ... the attack caused serious damage to many installations of which Pearl Harbor suffered the worst. (MORE) RADIO ANNOUNCER'S VOICE(cont'd) We will not forget this day -- and we will never let the Japanese forget it... \nPREW (yells at radio) You said it! Who they think they're fight in? (incoherent with rage; to GIRLS) They're pickin trouble with the best Army in -- the best riflemen -- you know we the ony country on the face of the earth that uses the shooting gunsling, not the carrying gunsling. You know that? \nThe radio continues on under the scene. Alma and Gorgette speak breathlessly, in a rush. \nALMA We've been at Queens Hospital -- giving blood -- \nGORGETTE The town's a madhouse. Trucks, busses, jeeps all over -- \nALMA A house on Kuhio Street was bombed OUT -- \nGORGETTE And the drugstore on McKully and King is smashed flat. And the man and his wife were killed -- \nPrew gestures to radio as if he's heard all about it. He sticks his shirttails into his trousers. \nPREW I gotta get back to the Post -- I'll try to get in touch with you in a couple days -- \nALMA The Post? Tonight? \nPrew nods vehemently, moves across room to a table. \nALMA But why? \nPREW Why? There's a war goin on. \nALMA But you can't! You're not fit yet -- you're weak as a kitten -- you're AWOL -- they'll throw you in the STOCKADE -- \n", "test3_id": 1955}

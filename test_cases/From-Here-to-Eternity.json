{"train": "FROM HERE TO ETERNITY \nWritten by \nDaniel Taradash \n(Second Draft - 8/29/1952) \nFADE IN: \nEXT. QUADRANGLE - DAY \nLONG SHOT The quadrangle of Army buildings is quiet and deserted. A broken-down taxi drives in at one corner and slowly makes its way around the quadrangle. SUPERIMPOSED over shot is the LEGEND: \nHAWAII, 1941 SIX MONTHS BEFORE PEARL HARBOR \nThe taxi pulls up across the street from camera. A soldier gets out, pulls two heavily loaded barracks bags after him. He pays the driver, hoists the bags to his back, moves toward camera. The taxi drives away slowly. The soldier walks toward steps leading to a low building. He is PREWITT (called \"PREW\" for short), 22 years old, well-built, good-looking. He wears an enlisted man's uniform and on the sleeves are marks where chevrons have been removed. He pauses, looks up over the door. CAMERA PANS UP to sign which reads: ORDERLY ROOM - G COMPANY, 219TH REGIMENT. \nMEDIUM SHOT A small thin soldier in an undershirt and fatigue pants backs out of the screen door and into shot. He is wielding a frayed broom. This is PRIVATE ANGELO MAGGIO. He is violent and funny and sour and friendly. He sees Prewitt's legs but not his face, speaks as he sweeps a cloud of dust off the porch. \nMAGGID Fine way to pass the time. Good for the mind. \nPREW Hello, Maggio. \nMaggio turns and stares at Prew, astonished. \nMAGGIO Prew...? \nPREW (NODS) I transferred out of Fort Shatter. \nMaggio notices the marks on the sleeves where the stripes have been removed. Prew follows his glance. \nMAGGIO You quit the Bugle Corps...? \nPrew nods. Maggio jerks his head toward the sign. \nMAGGIO To here...? \nPREW (SHRUGS) That's what the orders say. \nMAGGIO You made a bad mistake. This outfit they can give back to Custer. \nPrew smiles slightly, starts toward door. \nMAGGIO The Captain ain't in yet. \nPrew puts down his barracks bags. \nPREY I'll look around. \nMAGGIO (smiles for first time) Maybe we borrow some money from a twenty per cent man and take a real trip to town some night. \nPHEW Maybe. \nTRUCKING SHOT ALONG COMPANY STREET Prew walks slowly down the raised porch alongside the street. He takes the mouthpiece of a bugle from his pocket, jiggles it idly, a habit of his. He comes to the Dayroom, glances through the screen door, goes in. \nINT. DAYROOM - DAY \nMEDIUM SHOT The Dayroom has a pool table, ping-pong table, a radio, etc. Moth-eaten, upholstered chairs line both walls. The place is empty as Prew enters. He looks around casually, sees the pool table in an alcove. He moves over to it, puts the bugle mouthpiece in his pocket, picks a cue from the rack on the wall. He switches on the light, chalks the cue. \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT The triangle of balls is already racked on the table. Prew addresses the cue ball, shoots and breaks the rack solidly. He watches the balls hurry around the table. \nWARDEN'S VOICE (O. S.) What're you think you're doing!? Why ain't you out in the field with the Compny? What's your name? \nThe voice is brawling, brash, vigorous. Prew turns slowly. CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS to INCLUDE FIRST SERGEANT MILTON WARDEN, almost at Prew's elbow. He is thirty-four, big and powerful, has a neatly-trimmed moustache. \nPREW Prewitt. Transfer from Shafter. \nWARDEN Yeah. I heard about you. \nPREW I heard about you, too, Warden. \nWARDEN Well, put up that cue and come along. This here's a rifle outfit, Prewitt. You ain't suppose to enjoy yourself before sundown. The Man's very particlar about little things like that. \nWarden goes out of the Dayroom. Prew puts up the cue and follows him. \nEXT. COMPANY STREET \nTRUCKING SHOT as Prew and Warden walk along the porch, Warden a few paces ahead. They go into the Orderly Room. \nINT. ORDERLY ROOM - DAY \nMEDIUM SHOT as Prew and Warden enter. Maggio is sweeping the room. MAZZIOLI, a bespectacled, intellectual-looking Private First Class, is at the clerk's desk, opening it, taking out papers, etc. Prew sits on a bench as Warden goes over to Mazzioli. \nWARDEN Mazzioli! Grant went to the hospital yesterday. Did you make up his sick record? Did you make a note for the morning report?! You're the Compny Clerk. The lousy Sickbook is your job! \nMAZZIOLI Those medics didn't get the Sickbook back till late yesterday -- I'll tend to it right now -- \nWARDEN Thanks. I already done it for you. \nANOTHER ANGLE Maggio has swept his way over to Prew. He stops sweeping now, stares at the other man as if still incredulous. \nMAGGIO But you the beat bugler they got over at Shatter. You probly the best on this whole Rock. \nIn b.g., Warden has turned from Mazzioli and is looking at Prew. Prew looks back coolly, answers Maggio thoughtfully. \nPREW They don't. \nHOLMES Would you have us disband our fighting program because one man got hurt? \nPREW No, sir. I dint say -- \nHOLMES You might as well say stop war because one man got killed. Our fighting program is the best morale builder we have off here away from home. \nPREW I don't want it disbanded, sir. (DOGGEDLY) But I don't see why any man should fight unless he wants to. \nHOLMES It looks to me like you're trying to acquire a reputation as a lone wolf, Prewitt. You should know that in the Army it's not the individual that counts. If a man wants to get ahead he has certain responsibilities to fulfill that go beyond the regulations. It might look as though I were a free agent, but I'm not. Nobody is. \nHolmes waits hopefully for a moment, then realizes Prew is not going to respond further. He stands. Prew snaps to attention. \nHOLMES Maybe you'll change your mind. In the meantime just don't make any mistakes in my outfit. (TO WARDEN) I've got to go into town. Is there anything else for me today, Sergeant? \nWARDEN (holds up papers) Yea, sir! The Compny Pond Report's got to be made out. It's due TOMORROW -- \nHOLMES You make it out. Is that all? \nWARDEN (holds up more papers) No, sir! \nHOLMES Well, whatever it is, you fix it. If there's anything that has to go in this afternoon, sign my name. I won't be back. \nHe goes out, crossing Warden's desk and knocking a wire basket filled with papers on the floor. In a moment, the sound of the screen door slamming is heard. Warden picks up the papers. \nWARDEN He'd strangle on his own spit if I weren't here to swab out his throat for him. (TO PREW) Come on. I'll show you the Supply Room. \nWarden goes out to Orderly Room, Prew following. \nINT. ORDERLY ROOM - DAY \nMEDIUM SHOT as Prew and Warden enter and walk through. Maggio bobs his head approvingly at Prew. \nEXT. COMPANY STREET - DAY \nMEDIUM SHOT WARDEN AND PREW as they come out of the Orderly Room. Prew hoists his barracks bags to his shoulders, balancing them delicately. CAMERA TRUCKS with him and Warden as they walk down the porch. \nWARDEN (one of his unexpected INTENSE BURSTS) Know what you did just now? (MORE) WARDEN(CONT'D) When you turned down Dynanite Holmes' boxing squad? You put your head in a noose. Things are soft for a boxer in his Compny. Otherwise, you better know how to soljer. \nPHEW I can soljer with any man. \nWARDEN This ain't the Bugle Corps -- this is straight duty. \nPREW I'll take my chances. \nA convertible, top down, drives by and pulls up outside the Orderly Room. KAREN HOLMES, a tall, lean blonde woman, gets out. Her skirt hikes up a little as she goes up the stairs to the Orderly Room. Warden and Prew stop walking and watch her. Karen stops, glances at Warden momentarily, then goes into the Orderly Room. \nWARDEN Since when is this place gettin to be the Royal Hawaiian? \nPREW Who's she? \nWARDEN His wife. Captain Holmes'. \nThey resume walking. \nWARDEN You'll fight, Prewitt. You'll fight because Captain Holmes got a bee in his hat he needs a winnin team to make Mayor. And if you don't do it for him you'll do it for me. I only been in this outfit eight months myself but I learned one thing. My job is to keep him happy. The more he's happy the less he bothers me and the better I run his Compny. So we know where we stand, don't we, kid? \nPREW I know where I stand. I don't believe that's the only way a man can get along. (MORE) PREW(CONT'D) A man's got to make up his own mind and go his own way. It he don't, he's nothin... \nWARDEN Maybe back in the days of the pioneers a man could go his own way. But not in our time, kid. Today you got to play ball. You got to divide it all by two. \nThey have reached a Dutch door, top half open. A sign over it reads: SUPPLY ROOM. \nMEDIUM SHOT SHOOTING INTO SUPPLY ROOM SUPPLY SERGEANT LEVA is eating a candy bar with one hand and leisurely typing up a form with the other. He is a foolish- looking man, about thirty-five. \nWARDEN Lava! Can't I once walk by this Supply Room and find you workin with both hands! \nLEVA (comes up to door) I can't do no better on what you people pay me. \nWARDEN Draw some supplies for this man. (TO PREW) That's G Compny barracks over there. Get rid of your bags and come back here, and Leva'll find you a cart to lug your stuff over in. Save you makin four five trips. \nPREW (surprised, pleased) Okay. \nWARDEN I just hate to see energy wasted. Any kind. Besides, you'll be needin yours. \nPrew walks off, toting the barracks bags. The bang of the Orderly Room door is heard and Lava and Warden look in that direction. \nLONG SHOT KAREN HOLMES FROM WARDEN AND LEVA'S ANGLE as she walks along porch toward them. She is at a considerable distance. Karen is about thirty. She wears a \nsweater and skirt. She is aware the men are studying her. \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT WARDEN AND LEVA watching Karen. Leva leans over the counter. \nLEVA Her and them sweaters. \nLONG SHOT KAREN FROM WARDEN AND LEVA'S POV as she continues toward them. As much as a man can make out, she is probably not wearing a brassiere. Warden's and Lava's voices, loud at first, get softer and softer the nearer Karen gets to camera. At end of the shot, as she is only a few yards away, they are practically whispering. \nWARDEN'S VOICE Army women... They're cold, they got no more warmth than a diamond. There's no pleasure in them... \nLEVA'S VOICE Yeah, but this one knows the score... Like I been tellin you. \nWARDEN'S VOICE (SARCASTIC) Is that right? \nLEVA'S VOICE Okay, not around here. But I was back at Fort Bliss with Holmes. When they was married only a year or two. I heard plenty about the lady then. Plenty. \nHe moves over to her. \nHOLM ES How many times do I have to tell you I'm sorry, about that? How many times that I had no way of knowing - \nHe puts his hands on her shoulders. Karen shakes away, rises, faces him. \nKAREN You had a way of knowing, Dana. I want to go to bed. Please get out of my bedroom. \nHolmes looks at her sullenly, then exits to adjoining room, closing the door behind him. There is a moment of silence, then a sharp snap as Karen breaks the comb in two. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. DAYROOM - NIGHT \nMEDIUM SHOT WARDEN The room is fairly well filled with soldiers. The click of pool balls is heard over shot. Warden is reading a newspaper.. A column heading, conspicuous in shot, reads: JAPS ADVANCE IN CHINA. Warden drops the paper on his lap, looks toward pool table, squinting thoughtfully. \nFULL SHOT AT POOL TABLE Maggio, Prew and CHIEF CHOATE, a Corporal, are playing pool. Choate is a full Choctaw Indian, a man of great bulk and tolerance. He speaks in a tremendously deep bass voice. The \ntable on one side is surrounded by the prizefighters of G Company. They are IRE GALOVITCH, an ape-like, bent-kneed man weighing about two twenty, with a widow's peak almost to his eyebrows; BALDY DHOM, chunky and tough, his head as bald as an orange; TURP THORNHILL, a stringy, chinless Mississipian; HENDERSON, a tall, hard Texan; CHAMP WILSON, wiry and good- looking. They are all Sergeants except Wilson, who is a Corporal. The men have been heckling Prew and are watching with cold belligerence. Choate, bending over his cue, shoots and misses. \nCHOATE I'm coldern a Idaho winter tonight. \nPrew shoots, makes a brilliant shot. \nMAGGIO Man, what I would not give to have this character in the corner poolroom in my home town: I'd dress him up on overhalls and a straw hat and put a grass in his teeth, and I would make a whole mint of ghelt off him! \nChoate laughs deeply. Prew sizes up a new shot. \nWILSON We'd of won last year if we had a good middleweight. You box as good as you used to over at Shatter we're a cinch this year. \nPrew doesn't respond. He bends over his cue again. \nTHORNHILL You ain't forget the Division champs get ten day furloughs, did you, son? Ey? \nGALOVITCH You no talk now, Prewitt. But out in field with us you sing different song. An don't think you are tough guy. Quickest way to stockade is BEING TOUGH guy. \nHENDERSON You heard him. Better think it over. \nMAGGIO Lissen, it's his right not to fight if he don't want. Without bein kicked around. Now, we playin pool. Whyn't you take off? \nDHOM You want a busted head, Maggio? \nMAGGIO (SERIOUSLY) No. \nDHOM Then keep your big nose out altogether. (turns back to Prew) Trainin season starts next week -- \nPrew has been growing more and more agitated, as much by an inner turmoil as by the men. His control snaps suddenly. \nPREW I told you I quit fightin! I'm through! An that's all she wrote: You guys want to put the screws on, go ahead. I can take anything you hand out! \nDHOM Okay, Prewitt. No halts barred. \nThe five men move off, file out of the Dayroom. \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT WARDEN His paper still on his lap. He has been watching. He wears a faint smile of respect. \nMEDIUM SHOT PHEW, MAGGIO, CHOATE Prew chalks his cue, hands trembling, turns to Maggio. \nPREW Thanks. \nMAGGIO I just hate to see a good man get it in the gut. \nCHOATE You might as well get use to it, kid. You probly be seein it often before you die. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT \nMEDIUM SHOT PREW AND CHOATE In b.g. a few of the men are moving to and from the latrine but most of them are in their bunks. Over shot the sound of a bugle blowing Tattoo is heard. Lights are being extinguished in various parts of the room. Prew and Choate are lying on adjoining bunks, smoking. Choate's voice is almost linked to his last speech of preceding scene. \nCHO ATE ... oh, sure, we got a few bad non- coms and we got Dynamite Holmes for a Captain. But I been around twenty years in this Army. They even up. \nIn b. g. Warden and SERGEANT PETE (POP) KARELSEN come through from the latrine. The latter is a grizzled, crumbled dog- face, about fifty. \nCHOATE Take A Compny. They got the best Compny Commander I ever saw. But their Topkick -- he ain't no Warden. \nWarden stops beside Prew and Karelsen moves on, going in to a small room off the main squadroom. Warden's big, powerful body is covered only by a towel around his loins. He smiles at Prew. \nWARDEN Hello, kid. Everythin nice and comfy? \nPREW Never better. \nWARDEN 'at's the lull before the storm, kid. Set yourself. \nHe moves off, goes into the room he shares with Karelsen. \nPREW What's the deal with him, anyway? I can't figure him. \nThe lights are almost all off and activity in the room has ended. \nCHOATE The Warden? He's a wild man. He was in the 15th when they seen their action in the Settlement in Shanghai. I heard about it down in the Philippes even. He got himself a DSC and a Purple Heart out of it but you'd never know it if I dint tell you. This next war comes, Warden'll be right in there, standin up on the skyline, trio to get himself killed, but nothing will ever touch him. He'll come through maddern, wildern, craziern ever. All I know is he's the best soljer I ever saw... \nThe lights are all out now and the room is in darkness. \nFADE OUT. \nLONG SHOT FROM WARDEN'S POV as Karen drives by, turning her head slightly toward Warden. There is the vaguest trace of i smile. \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT FEATURING WARDEN as he turns to watch the departing car. \nLEVA I'm tellin you, Top, she's trouble. You better keep your mind off what you're thinkin. \nCAMERA MOVES TO CLOSE SHOT of Warden, still looking after the car, thinking. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - DAY \nMEDIUM SHOT WARDEN AND HOLMES It is a gloomy, rainy day and the lights are on in the office. Warden is at his desk, working. Holmes is buckling on his trench coat. He wears a happy smile. \nHOLMES I won't be back in time to take Retreat. (winks at Warden) Or Reveille either, probably. \nWARDEN Yes, sir. \nHOLMES (strides back and forth; JOVIALLY) All work and no play, Sergeant. All you do is sit around sweating over this paper and that. There are other things in this world beside work. \nWarden carries some official papers to Holmes' desk. \nHOLMES (bending over, tying SHOELACE) (MORE) HOLMES(CONT'D) You ought to get out more yourself, Warden. \nWarden is looking directly at the picture of Karen on Holmes' desk. \nWARDEN I've been considering it. \nHe turns aside as Holmes straightens up. \nHOLMES Well, I'm going. \nHe claps Warden on the back fraternally. \nHOLMES I'm leaving it in your care, Sergeant. \nWARDEN It'll be here when you get back. \nHolmes goes out. Warden turns back to Holmes' desk. He is still holding the papers in one hand. He looks at Karen's picture, picks it up with his other hand, squints at it, considering the chances very, very carefully. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. BACK PORCH OF HOLMES' HOUSE - DAY \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT WARDEN standing on the open porch, in the rain. He wears a GI raincoat. He is squinting at the door with the same expression he used looking at Karen's picture. He takes a deep breath as if he were going off a high diving board, then knocks briskly. A shadow moves across the room behind the curtains. Then Karen opens the door. She is in shorts and a blouse. \nKAREN Oh. If it isn't Sergeant Warden. You better step inside or you'll get wet. \nWarden opens the screen door and jumps in past the water running off the eaves. \nINT. SMALL PANTRY OFF KITCHEN - DAY \nMEDIUM SHOT as Warden jumps in. He takes off his rain hat. \nWARDEN I am wet. \nKAREN If you're looking for my husband, he isn't here. \nWARDEN (taking the long chance) And if I'm not looking for him? \nKAREN (UNSMILING) He still isn't here. If that does you any good. \nWARDEN (QUICKLY) Well, I'm looking for him. Do you know where he is? \nKAREN I haven't the slightest idea. Perhaps he's in town. I guess it was `in town' the way you put it, wasn't it? Or perhaps he's at the Club. Having a drink. \nWARDEN (fishes in his pocket, brings out papers) I got some papers it's important for him to sign. Today. \nKAREN (TURNS) I'll try phoning him at the Club for you. \nWARDEN I never like to disturb a man drinking. \nKAREN (TURNS BACK) What is it you want, Sergeant? \nWARDEN I could use a drink myself right now. Bad. Anyway, I got a faint suspicion the Captain's `in town.' Ain't you going to ask me in? \nKaren finally smiles, faintly. She goes into the kitchen, leaving the door open. Warden follows her. \nINT. KITCHEN HOLMES HOUSE - DAY \nMEDIUM SHOT The kitchen is small and undistinguished. Karen takes a whisky bottle from a cabinet, pours a straight, stiff drink, puts it on the sink. Warden puts the papers down and drinks. Karen sits on a high kitchen stool. \nKAREN You're taking an awful chance, you know. My maid is liable to be home any time. \nWARDEN No she won't. Thursday's her day off. \nHe takes off his raincoat, drops it on a chair. \nKAREN You think of everything, don't you, Sergeant? \nWARDEN I try. In my position you have to. \nKAREN (goes to sink, picks up THE PAPERS) Are these really important? \nWARDEN Yes. But not important they get signed today. Tomorrow's okay. \nCLOSE FLASH WILSON AND PREW Wilson bawling Prew out, thumbing him to one side of obstacle course. \nFLASHES PREW chinning himself on bar setup near obstacle course; he is near physical exhaustion. \nOBSTACLE COURSE PREW going through alone, on his belly in deep mud. \nCLOSEUP PREW (CULMINATION OF SUPERIMPOSED CLOSEUPS AND END OF MONTAGE) \ncoming HEAD-ON into camera as he bellies through the mud of the obstacle course. Snatch of mingled voices of non-coms yelling \"Keep it downs\", \"Get that nose in the mud!\", etc. Prew is utterly spent. His face drops into the mud, which splatters up, obscuring the screen. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. KITCHEN - DAY \nCLOSE SHOT SWIRLING DISHWATER IN SINK \nMEDIUM SHOT PREW bent over the sink, scraping, washing and rinsing cooking pans and mixing basins. He hangs the soap bucket on the hot faucet and turns it on full force. As he does, PRIVATE WILLARD, a fat, whining cook, dumps an additional huge pile of pans before him. Prew looks at them ruefully. Willard says something to him with a \"hustle up\" gesture. The faucet drowns the words. \nMEDIUM SHOT ANOTHER PART OF KITCHEN PREW AT SINK IN B.G. Men are working in the steady, helpless motion of the KP. Waiters swing in and out of the entrances leading to the mess halls, carrying large trays. \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT SERGEANT STARK The Mesa Sergeant, a tall, gaunt man, surveys the scene possessively. Maggio, Dining Room Orderly today, wearing a soiled white coat, flashes by to the mess hall, almost dropping his loaded tray in his haste. \nMEDIUM SHOT PRIVATE TREADWELL A slow, lazy, heavy man, peeling potatoes. There is a large kettle filled with dirty water in front of him in which the potatoes are floating. Treadwell stabs at one with a long fork, misses it. He stabs again, almost in slow motion, misses again. He sees Stark glowering over him. \nTREADWELL Ah+m suppose to be a automatic rifle man, not a spud-cutter. \nSTARK (DISGUSTEDLY) Rifle man, huh? All somebody'd have to do would be holler war at you and it'd be over the hill and far away. \nStark walks off. \nTREADWELL ... they just give me my chance they'll see... \nHe is surprised and pleased as he spears a potato this time. He raises it triumphantly like a caught fish. \nMEDIUM SHOT PREW AND WILLARD The faucet is still on and we cannot hear what Willard says as he dumps more pans before Prew. However, he is obviously complaining that Prew is slow. Prew, sweating and angry, barks something back at him and turns the faucet off. \nPREW No cook ever used that many panel Not even for an officers, banquet, ladies invited! Want me to grow couple more arms?! \nStark, always alert to trouble, comes into shot. Willard sees him and speaks with whining dignity, for Stark's benefit. \nWILLARD All I ask is that you keep the pans washed up so they're clean when I need them. In order that I am allowed to cook the kind of food required for men who work hard all day and who need good nourishing food to get their nourishment. \nSTARK Hole up 'at noise. This man's hot as a forty-five shootin downhill. \nWILLARD (TERRIBLY INJURED) How you think I can do my job if the Mess Sergeant takes sides with a goldbricking KP? What do you think I am? \nSTARK I think you're a fat cook who can't cook. \nAs Willard retires, Maggio pours through from the mass hall. Screaming joyously, he shoves two empty platters in front of him. \nMAGGIO Comin through! Comin through! Me and my table waiters! (MORE) MAGGIO(CONT'D) We workin our tail off. They runnin us to death. Hot stuff! Comin through hot stuff one side! \nNobody pays any attention but Prew, who smiles at him. Maggio winks back. \nMAGGIO Hello, Prew! Bettern being threwn in jail, ain't it? \nMaggio passes camera, leaving the shot and disclosing Warden, who has entered from the mess hall in his wake. He carries a dish of eggs and sausage and is leaning against a pastry table. He is grinning lovingly toward Prew. He strolls over to Prew. He eats through following. The smile never leaves his face, broadens as the scene progresses. \nWARDEN You look awful tard, kid. \nCLOSE SHOT PREW working over the sink. \nWARDEN'S VOICE How do you like straight duty?. Life in a rifle compny, eh? \nPrew stops working, turns toward Warden. \nPREW What makes you think I mind it? \nMEDIUM SHOT FEATURING KP'S, STARK, MAGGIO, WILLARD, TREADWELL as something electric transmits itself and they all stop what they are doing to look over toward Prew and Warden. \nWARDEN I didn't say you minded it, kid. I just said you looked tard. Drawn to a fine edge. \nPREW (SMILES BACK) I don't mind it, Top. It's a great life, this. I find a pearl, I'll cut you in. Fifty-fifty, If you hadn't put me here, I wouldn't have had no chance to find it. \nTWO SHOT WARDEN AND PREW \nWARDEN Well, well, there's a man for you. I'll see if I can fix you up with a lot more since you like it so much. How you like the garbage detail? \nPREW Thanks, Top, I've had it. You give it to me Tuesday. Remember? \nWARDEN (nods, as if just REMEMBERING) Well, then, how 'bout street cleaning detail? \nPREW That, too. Yesterday. \nWARDEN (NODS) You got a better memory than me. Guess the best thing to do is leave you right in the kitchen a while, huh? \nHe pretends to turn away, then stops, turns back. \nWARDEN Course if you was an ath-a-leet you wouldn't have to pull KP. Or any fatigue duty for that matter... \nPREW (not smiling now) If you think you can push me into fightin, Warden, you're wrong. Not you and Dynamite and The Treatment. I'm twice the man you are. If you dint have them stripes I'd take you out on the green and beat you to a pulp. \nWARDEN (smile growing bigger) Don't let the stripes worry you, kid. I can always take my shirt off. Take it off right now. \nPREW You'd like that. You could get me a year in the Stockade for that one, couldn't you? \nINT. NEW CONGRESS CLUB - LARGE CLUB ROOM - NIGHT \nFULL SHOT Several rooms branch off from this main one. There are about a dozen soldiers in civilian clothes -- and about a dozen hostesses. Several couples are dancing. The man at the piano is banging away, his music clashing cacophonically with a jukebox record from an adjoining room. CAMERA PANS as Mrs. Kipfer moves to and fro encouraging the men to enjoy themselves. The New Congress is a sort of primitive U.S.O., a place of well-worn merriment. It is not a house of prostitution but the girls look available for goosing... all but one we see at the end of the PAN. She sits alone on a couch. This is LORENE. There is an innocent, child-like look about her. Her hair is done demurely in a circular roll low on her neck. She is about twenty-four. She is reading a \nmagazine, untouched by the din around her. \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT SERGEANT \"FATSO\" JUDSON pounding the piano as if he is trying to knock the keys out. He has an enormous head and a hogshead chest. He resembles Porky Pig. His dead eyes look like two beads of caviar spaced far apart on a great white plate. \nMEDIUM SHOT NEAR CURTAINS TO VESTIBULE Maggio is attempting some serious dancing with SANDRA, a very tall girl. Fatso's furious tempo and tune keep drowning the langorous tango coming from the jukebox. Maggio keeps switching his style as he tries to get out of the range of the piano but cannot. He is very annoyed. He and Sandra dance out of shot, as Prew and Annette enter from the vestibule. CAMERA PANS them to a trio of girls on a couch. \nANNETTE ... Girls, here's some new poison. This is Billy and Jean and Nancy. \nThe girls smile, ad-lib hellos. Prew is looking over the girls' heads at someone in rear of room out of shot. \nMEDIUM SHOT LORENE FROM PREW'S POV As if she senses someone is staring at her, she looks up from the magazine, smiles serenely across the room. \nMEDIUM SHOT FEATURING PREW AND ANNETTE as she reacts sourly to Prew's reaction to Lorene. He seems transfixed. \nANNETTE Don't tell me the Princess is your style. \nAnnette takes his arm, moves him toward two quite good- looking girls talking to a soldier. \nANNETTE Meet Suzanne and Roxanne. \nThe girls greet him heartily but Prew is looking back over his shoulder at Lorene. Annette plucks his sleeve with haughty disdain. \nANNETTE Much as I adore your company, you must allow me to tear myself away. I see a few friends at the door. (SNAPS) Also I can see I will be of no use to you much. \nShe walks off. The other girls resume talking to the soldier. Prew continues to gaze across the room. \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT LORENE smiling back. Her head tilts up slowly as if someone is coming toward her. Prew comes into shot and stands before her, tongue-tied. She pats the couch. Her voice is low- pitched, poised. \nLORENE Would you like to sit down? \nPREW (SITTING) Oh... sure. \nLORENE I'm Lorene. \nPREW (enchanted by the name) Lorene... \nLORENE I haven't seen you in here before. \nPrew gestures with the membership card. \nPREW I dint know about this place till now. A friend of mine brought me. We're stationed at Schofield. \nLORENE Oh. Somehow I didn't think you were a soldier. \nPREW (bridles a bit) Well, I am. And I'm in for the whole ride. I'm a thirty-year man. \nLORENE I suppose it's different when a fellow is going to make a career of it. \nPREW There ain't anythin wrong with a soljer that ain't wrong with everyone else. \nLorene smiles her fatal smile at Prew's seriousness. \nLORENE I like you just the same. I liked you the minute I saw Annette bringing you in. \nPREW (MELTS) Me, too. I mean when I came in. I saw you over here -- \nThere is a commotion across the room. A group of man and girls are surrounding the piano. Fatso has stopped playing and a shouting argument is going on between him and Maggio. Prew looks over, concerned. \nFATSO'S VOICE I'll play loud as I want, ya little Wop! \nA babble of voices drowns out Maggio's reply. \nPREW Friend of mine. (RISES) You wait right here for me, will ya? \nLORENE (SMILES SWEETLY) Surely. \nMEDIUM SHOT AT PIANO where two men are holding Fatso and three girls are restraining Maggio. The others are amused by the quarrel, but Fatso and Maggio are deadly serious. \nMAGGIO Mess with me, Fatstuff, I'll pull you apart! \nFATSO You're the kind of character I eat for breakfast, ya little -- \nMaggio breaks away from the girls and rushes toward Patso but Prew, stepping through the group, grabs him. Mrs. Kipfer bustles into the melee. \nMRS. KIPFER Now, you gentlemen know I will not have any of this sort of thing. \nMAGGIO Shut up, you Wop, he says to me! \nFATSO Little Mussolini here tryin to tell me what way to play the piano. \nMAGGIO Yeah, my ear drums fit to bust already with that noise! \nMRS. KIPFER You man can simply leave if you're not going to behave yourselves. \nPREW Come on, Angelo, come on -- \nMAGGIO -- Ony my friends can call me Wop -- \nMEDIUM SHOT AT SIDE OF ROOM where Prew hauls Maggio away from the piano. \nSOLDIER (has been watching) You know who that guy is, buddy? \nWARDEN (OUTRAGE) Listen, what started all this, anyway? Why'm I shakin inside like a school kid out with teacher! Where'd I come up with a yen for of all things the Compny Commander's wife! And her actin like Lady Astor's horse all because I only got here on time! \nWarden's burst shatters the tension. Karen breaks into laughter. After a moment, Warden joins in. \nKAREN On the other hand, I've got a bathing suit under my dress. \nWARDEN Funny. I got one in a U-Drive-It parked around the corner. \nHe takes her hand. They rise and walk away, backs to camera. They merge with the other couples in the little park. \nINT. LARGE CLUB ROOM - NEW CONGRESS - NIGHT \nMEDIUM SHOT COUCH Fatso's piano music o.s. Prew is slumped on the couch. He stubs out the cigarette, which is almost burnt down. He sees someone coming toward him, slowly raises his eyes. Lorene comes into shot, looks down at him. \nPREW How's the surfboard rider? \nLORENE That was a terrible way to have acted. What you did. \nPREW I was jealous. \nLORENE (LAUGHS) You're a funny one. \nPREW What do you dames want? To take the heart out of a man and tie it up in barbed wire? \nLORENE (angry because she really LIKES PREW) Now, look here, what do you think Mrs. Kipfer pays us for? We're hired to be nice to all the boys. They're all alike. Is it so important? \nPREW (STANDS; URGENTLY) Yes, it's important. Maybe we seem all alike but none of us is ever all alike. (PAUSE) All right, I'm sorry about before. \nLORENE (touched by his outburst) That piano is about to drive me out of my mind. Let's go up to Mrs. Kipfer's suite and sit there. She lets us use it sometimes... for somebody special. \nPREW Are you mad? \nLORENE No, I'm not mad. \nPREW Because if you're still mad I'd just rather we called the whole thing off. \nLORENE (takes his arm) You certainly are a funny one. \nThey walk away from camera, merging with the others in-the room. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. OCEAN AND BEACH - NIGHT \nFULL SHOT WAVE sweeping over camera, spray flying. \nMEDIUM SHOT ON BEACH A tiny beach set among rocks. The pale sand glows in the moonlight. Warden, in a bathing suit, is lighting a fire about ten yards from the water's edge. Karen is just stepping out of her dress; her bathing suit is underneath. A couple of GI blankets near the fire. Her teeth are beginning to chatter in the chill of the night air; she raises her arms to the sky longingly, happily. \nKAREN I hope the ocean's ice cold. I hope I freeze in a solid chunk. \nWARDEN (sudden, intense laugh) Just so long's you melt afterwards. \nKAREN I love the way you laugh. \nHe stands, moves to her. She laughs, turns and runs into the water. He runs after her. \nFULL SHOT WAVE near shore, as Karen dives into it. Warden follows her. The wave washes over them. \nINT. NEW CONGRESS CLUB - MRS. KIPFER'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nMEDIUM SHOT DIVAN CAMERA ANGLED so we see only back of the divan. We hear soft chuckles from Prew and Lorene o.s., then silence for several moments. CAMERA MOVES as we hear a few more low, intimate laughs, then Prew and Lorene are disclosed on the couch, their heads close together as if they have just kissed pleasantly but not passionately. Mrs. Kipfer's living room is on the order of the vestibule; it, too, has a faded lavender feeling. A door leading to another room is half open in b.g. A door leading to a hall is closed. Prew's arm is around Lorene's shoulder; he is very relaxed, regards her with something like wonder. Lorene is mellower, too, making no effort now to be \"the Princess.\" She speaks as if resuming a conversation. \nLORENE ... I enlisted, too. I came out here on my own. To get away from my home town. In Oregon. \nPREW How come? \nLORENE I had a boy friend. I was a waitress. He was from the richest family in town. He just married the girl suitable for his position. After three years of going around with me. (PAUSE) It's a pretty story, isn't it? Maybe they could make a movie of it. \nPREW They did. Ten thousand of them. \nANOTHER ANGLE Lorene smiles. \nLORENE So I left and went to Seattle, as a waitress. And I met a girl just back from Hawaii. She said she'd made a lot of money working for Mrs. Kipfer. I caught the first boat. I've been here a year and two months. \nPREW You like it much? \nLORENE Oh, I don't like it. But I don't mind it. Anyway, I won't be here forever. \nPREW No. Sure not. I mean, why should you? \nLORENE I have it all figured out. In another year I'll be back home, with a pile of bills big enough to choke a steer. And then I will be all set for life -- \nThere is a sound at the door and they turn towards it. \nMEDIUM SHOT DOOR TO HALL as it opens slowly and a disembodied arm pokes through, its hand gripping the neck of a whisky bottle. After a moment, Maggio's head follows the arm through the door. He is grinning like an amateur conspirator. \nMAGGIO I dint hear no sounds of combat. So I figgered maybe you'd like a drink. \nTHREE SHOT as Maggio comes into the room. \nMAGGIO Or otherwise old Sandra would of drank it all by herself. She's a fine girl. But she drinks like a fish. \nThere are glasses on a cupboard near the divan. Maggio sets three of them up, starts to pour whisky into them. \nLORENE No, thanks. I never drink much. \nGENERAL SLATER At ease. Where're you men headed? \nGALOVITCH Top of pass, Sir. This man insubordinate. The Captain is teaching him lesson. \nGENERAL SLATER (FROWNS) What's your outfit, Sergeant? \nGALOVITCH Company G, 219th, Sir. \nThe General, still frowning slightly, nods. He signals his driver to move on. The jeep starts down the road. Galovitch gets on his bicycle. Prew starts hiking again. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - DAY \nMEDIUM SHOT Prew and Galovitch are standing in front of the Captain's desk. Prew is at attention, the heavy pack on his back; his face is drawn and tired; his clothes are plastered to him. He has regained his old expressionless look. Warden has swung his chair around and is surveying the scene. Holmes looks \nPrew up and down, half-smiles. \nHOLMES I take it you're ready to apologize to Sergeant Galovitch now. \nPREW No, sir, I'm not. \nHolmes' face sets; he jerks his head toward the window. \nHOLMES Take him back up there again, Galovitch. He hasn't had enough yet. \nGALOVITCH (nods unhappily, sick of BICYCLING) Yes, air. \nPrew about-faces and goes out. Galovitch follows. \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT FEATURING WARDEN HOLMES IN B.G. Warden watches Prew go out, then looks toward Holmes whose back is to him. Disgust is reflected on his face. \nMEDIUM SHOT WARDEN AND HOLMES Holmes slams his fist on his desk. \nHOLMES 1 know that kind of man! He's an againster. A bitter-ender. You can't be decent to a man like that. You have to tame him, like an animal! (TO WARDEN) Warden, I want you to prepare court martial papers. Insubordination and insolence to an officer. \nWARDEN Yes, sir. \nWarden swings around to his own desk. He thinks for several moments, tries to sound quite casual. \nWARDEN Too bad you got to lose a middleweight like that... \nHOLMES Why? Do you see any other way of breaking him? \nWARDEN I don't know... But even if he only gets three months, he'll still be in the Stockade when the boxing finals come up. \nHe looks over at Holmes, sees him scowling, weakening. \nWARDEN How about just giving him a good stiff Compny punishment for now? \nHolmes ponders the situation unhappily, rubs his hand over his face,. shakes his head as if the whole thing is too much for him. \nHOLMES All right, all right. But throw the book at him. \nWARDEN (pleased but impassive) Yes, sir. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. WARDEN'S ROOM OFF SQUAD ROCK - NIGHT \nCLOSE SHOT WARDEN SHOOTING INTO SMALL MIRROR He is trimming his moustache. \nWARDEN I'm sick of it! They ain't got no right to keep breakin it off in that kid! Sooner later Holmes is going to hound him right into the Stockade! \nCAMERA PULLS BACK, REVEALING Karelsen across the room, undressing tiredly, achingly. Warden is sharp and blustering, using Karelsen as an escape valve. During following he goes to his footlocker, opens it, takes out whisky bottle, drinks. \nWARDEN I'm through! I'm turnin in my stripes. I mean it, Pete. I could transfer out tomorrow. In Grade -- get that? To half a dozen Compnys in this Regmint! \nKARELSEN Oh, sure. I could be Chief of Staff, too, except I can't stand leaving all my old buddies. \nKarelsen is naked now except for a bath towel knotted around his middle. He slips his feet into Japanese-style, wooden clogs, starts slowly for the door. \nWARDEN Where you going, Little Sir Echo? \nKARELSEN To take my stinkin shower, if the First Sergeant's got no objections. Where'd you think? To the movies in this towel? \nWARDEN (GRINS) Hurry up. Let's go over to Choy's for some beer and tear up all the tables and chairs. \nKARELSEN (smiles, moves faster) Okay, Okay. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. CHOY'S - NIGHT \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT OLD CHOY An aged Chinese, at least seventy-five, OLD CHOY has a long white beard and wears a black skull cap and an embroidered robe. He is motionless, surveying the pandemonium which we hear over shot: the sounds of men laughing, talking and shouting blend with jukebox music blasting Chattanooga, Choo Choo. YOUNG CHOP, Old Choy's son, passes; he is thirty, white- aproned, bustling, Americanized. CAMERA PANS WITH him, DISCLOSING the small beer-house; it has unpainted cement walls and a cement floor; the only thing that might be called decorative is the jukebox. The place is crowded with men from Schofield, a raucous assemblage; everyone is drinking beer and the smoke hangs in thick layers. At a table near the door sit Prew, Maggio, Clark, Anderson, Treadwell and Mazzioli. At a corner table behind a forest of beer bottles and cans are Warden, Stark, Karelsen and Chief Choate. \nGROUP SHOT WARDEN'S TABLE \nSTARK ... China's the place. Your money's worth ten, twelves times as much. I'm gunna ship over soon as my time's up in this pineapple Army. \nKARELSEN (pinching beer off his NOSE) The Canal Zone for me. This girl down there. She was a planter's daughter, see. She lived a very sheltered life. A very moral young lady, Milt. I took her out to a high class dinner and then dancing. It was a great shock to her to learn about life. But she took it well. She got to like me very much after that. \nWARDEN The last time I heard it you told it different. \nKARELSEN Well, what did you expect? I was in a different mood, then. \nFatso drops the knife. It clatters on the floor. There is another audible whoosh of breath from the room. \nWARDEN Almost scared there wasn't anybody going to stop you for a minute, weren't you? (finally lowers his voice) Is there any other little things you punks'd like me to take care of for you? \nHe drops the beer bottles on a nearby table, strides to his own table. The room settles back, still hushed. Warden has broken the mood of certain death, but Fatso, still facing Maggio, bites off his words with sadistic, ominous venom. \nFATSO Tough monkey. Hard sister. Guys like you get to the Stockade sooner later. One day you walk in there I'll be waitin. I'll show you a coupla things. \nHe walks away, drops into a stool at the counter. \nMEDIUM SHOT WARDEN'S TABLE Warden stands beside the table, watching. He seems satisfied as Fatso moves away from Maggio. Still standing, he raises his half-filled bottle of beer, drinks. \nMEDIUM SHOT PREW'S TABLE Maggio drops onto the stool, sidles it over to the table. He half-whispers to Prew. \nMAGGIO I made a mistake I guess, but I don't see how I could of done anything else, after that big stoop said a thing like that. \nPrew leans over and picks the knife off the floor. \nPHEW I'll tell you your mistake. You didn't hit him hard enough to put him out. \nMAGGIO I hit him hard as I could. His head must be solid ivory. \nIn b.g. Warden puts down the beer bottle and stalks towards the door. Maggio and Prew turn to watch him pass. \nMAGGIO Anyway, I'm glad he stopped it. He's a good man, you know it? \nAs if on impulse, Prew rises and follows Warden out. \nEXT. CHOY'S - NIGHT \nMEDIUM SHOT as Prew carves out. Choy's is on a wide road across from the entrance to the Post. Prew looks around for Warden, sees him off to one side. CAMERA MOVES WITH Prew as he goes over to him. \nCLOSE SHOT WARDEN leaning against the building, undergoing a delayed reaction to the fierce moment in Choy's. He is white-faced, sweating heavily. He looks as if he's going to be sick. \nCLOSE SHOT PREW astonished yet appreciative that under Warden's confidence and control in Choy's there has been a human frailty. \nPREW ... That was a near thing. \nWARDEN ... Yeah. \nPrew holds out Fatso's knife. Warden is beginning to get control of himself; he manages a weak smile. \nWARDEN You keep it, kid. Keep it for a souvenir. \nPrew puts the knife in his pocket. They stare at one another a few moments, each inarticulate, each wanting to express some deep emotion of respect. \nWARDEN You ain't enjoying life much, are you, kid? \nPREW (THIN SMILE) They can kill you but they can't eat you, Top. \nWarden studies Prew thoughtfully. Prew turns to go back into Choy's. \nWARDEN Prewitt. \nPrew stops, turns back. \nWARDEN Could you stand a weekend pass? \nPrew stares at him for a second, incredulously, unable to find his voice. \nPREW I thought -- \nWARDEN You thought what, kid? \nPREW How about Dynamite? \nWARDEN Leave Dynamite to me. He signs most anything I put in front of him `thout readies it. \nThough Prew is overjoyed he is somehow unable to say \"thanks\"; Warden grins broadly at him. \nWARDEN I hear you gone dippy over some dame you met at the New Congress Club. \nHe slaps Prew on the shoulder roughly. \nWARDEN What'd you say her name was? \nFREW Lorene... \nWARDEN Pretty name. \nWarden walks off across the street. Prew stares after him. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. WAIKIKI BEACH - DAY \nCLOSE SHOT PREW AND LORENE Lorene is covering Prew with sand and has him almost completely buried. Only his face remains uncovered. He is griming up at her. She seems thoughtful. \nPREW ... Lorene... \nShe throws a towel over his face. He chuckles under it. \nLORENE My name's Alma. \nThe chuckle from under the towel dies. \nPREW (NODS) He's such a comical little guy and yet somehow he makes me always want to cry while I'm laughin at him. \nMEDIUM SHOT AT BAR FEATURING MAGGIO finishing a long gulp of beer. He puts glass down on the bar, hard. \nMAGGIO The Royal Hawaiian's jist around the corner. That's where them movie stars stay. Rita Hayworth and Joan Blondell and Maureen O'Hara... You look like a movie star, Lorene... yes, you do... How long 'fore we get in the war, Prew? \nPREW I don't know. Maybe we won't get in. \nMAGGIO Tha's what you say. \nHe jumps off the bar stool suddenly, tears off his tie. \nMAGGIO Hot in here. \nHe throws tie on the bar, The Bartender starts to protest. \nMAGGIO Swimming It's a great night for swimmin. (MORE) MAGGIO(CONT'D) (kicks off shoes) Goin swimmin with a movie star... \nHe is unbuttoning his shirt as he abruptly dashes away, People around are laughing at him again. \nMEDIUM SHOT ALMA AND PREW as Prew watches Maggio rush out. He sees something else o.s, which worries him. \nLONG SHOT FROM PREW'S POV The two MPs cross toward direction Maggio has taken. They are obviously going after him. \nMEDIUM SHOT ALMA AND PREW Alma follows Prew's troubled look. \nALMA You better go look out for him, \nPrew glances at her gratefully, then slips off his stool. He picks up Maggio's tie and shoes and hurries out after him. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. ROYAL HAWAIIAN GROUNDS - NIGHT \nMEDIUM SHOT Tall pale royal palms contrast with thick dark plants and bushes. An ornamental lamppost alongside a walking path a little distance away. Prew comes into shot cautiously, carrying Maggio's tie and shoes. He moves quickly, bends over. CAMERA PANS AND MOVES IN and we see it is Maggio's shirt and trousers which Prew has discovered on the ground. He looks at them wryly, picks them up, moves on. \nANGLE PREW IN F.G. AND LAMPPOST WITH BENCH NEAR IT IN B.G. Prew, carrying Maggio's clothes, stops as he sees what looks like a shadow lying across the bench. \nPREW (CALLS SOFTLY) Is that you, Angelo? \nThe shadow does not move. Prew approaches the bench. \nMEDIUM SHOT MAGGIO AND PREW Maggio is stretched out on the bench, seems to be sleeping blissfully. He is clothed only in his shorts. Despite himself, Prew smiles. He shakes the reclining figure. \nPREW Maggio, you nut. Get up. Wake up. \nMaggio mumbles without opening his eyes or moving. \nMAGGIO I'm sorry, sir. I won't do it again. Just don't lock me up, sir. Honest, I won't. \nPREW Here's your clothes. \nHe throws the clothes on Maggio. \nMAGGIO (opens his eyes) Well, give 'em back to the Indians. The Indians need clothes. All they wear is G strings. \nPREW Boy, are you drunk! \nMAGGIO ... maybe a movie star comes outs the hotel right now and picks us up and takes us back to the States in her private plane... and installs us in her private swimming pool -- \nPrew pulls Maggio off the bench and starts to drag him across the path away from the light. \nMAGGIO (YELLS) Take it easy, Prew. You scrapin my tail on the sandy sidewalk. \nPREW You'll get worse than that scraped - - Listen! \nThe ominous sound of leggins brushing each other is heard, not far away. Prew looks off. \nLONG SHOT THROUGH BUSHES The two MPs are on the street just outside the grounds. They are still looking for Maggio, somewhat aimlessly now. \nMEDIUM SHOT MAGGIO AND PREW Prew whispers to Maggio as he pulls him to his feet. \nPREW Come on before you're in trouble -- \nMaggio pushes him away. \nMAGGIO Stop it! \nPREW Shut up! \nMAGGIO I'm sick of its Can't a man get drunk? Can't a man do nothin? Can't a man put his lousy hands in his lousy pockets on a lousy street? A man gotta be hounded every minute of his life? I ain't gain to take its I ain't no cowards I ain't yellows I ain't no bums I ain't no scum! MPs! MPs! COME AND GET US! HERE WE IS! \nPREW (AGHAST) Now you done it. \nMEDIUM SHOT END OF PATH NEAR STREET The two MPs came running onto the path, spot Maggio and Prew about thirty yards away. \nMEDIUM SHOT PEW AND MAGGIO Maggio picks up his shoes, suddenly whips away from Prew and runs toward the MPs. \nANOTHER ANGLE NEAR MPs as they stop, surprised. Maggio is shouting, \"Can't a man do nothin?!\" as he hurls first one shoe, then the other, directly at the MPs. One MP is hit in the shoulder, staggers back. Maggio dashes between him and the second MP, but the latter reaches out and grabs him. Maggio wrenches loose but instead of running, suddenly wades in, arms swinging wildly. In a moment, he is hanging crab-like on the man's back. The first MP charges Maggio. Maggio grabs the second MP's club and hits the first MP over the head. \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT PREW Horrified, he starts toward the fracas. \nMEDIUM SHOT MAGGIO AND MPs IN F.G. PREW IN B.G. The second MP has managed to get out from under Maggio. He smashes his fist into Maggio's face as the latter continues to wield the club. Maggio sees Prew coming toward them. \nMAGGIO Get back! I'm handlin this! Take off! \nKAREN I don't know what's happened to you -- you were honest at first -- \nWARDEN At first! You were tough and solid as a rock -- and now you're a whining crybaby -- \nHe stops abruptly. \nKAREN And so they were married and lived unhappily ever after. \nThey are silent for several moments. \nWARDEN I've never been so miserable in my life as I have since I met you. \nKAREN Neither have I. \nWARDEN (CHEERLESSLY) I wouldn't trade a minute of it. \nKAREN (CHEERLESSLY) Neither would I. \nWarden rises and paces again. Suddenly he stops, turns, looks down at Karen, speaks in the same gloomy tone. \nWARDEN I'll probably make the lousiest officer they ever saw in this Army. \nA happy smile creeps over Karen's face. Despite himself, he begins to smile also. \nKAREN (FERVENTLY) You'll make a fine officer. A remarkable officer. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. PORCH OF ALMA'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nMEDIUM SHOT The porch is at the rear of the house, leading off from the living room. It is on the very edge of the cliff. Prew and Alma are dancing to the music of a portable victrola. It is playing \"Why Don't We Do This More Often?\" A table still contains the dinner plates. Prew's expression holds the wonder of a child at a magic show. He misses a step, stumbles. \nPREW I never caught on to dancing much. \nALMA You're a very good dancer. \nThe record ends and Alma goes to change it. CAMERA FOLLOWS Prew to the edge of the porch as he looks out over the view. \nLONG SHOT VIEW PROM PREW'S POV A magnificent panorama -- strings of lights in the valley and across on St. Louis Heights -- in the far distance the neon of Waikiki. \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT PREW working with his thoughts, afraid to broach them. He lights a cigarette, his fingers trembling. \nPREW I been wanting to tell you a long time now -- (DEEP BREATH) I love you. \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT ALMA looking through records for a new choice. She speaks quite conversationally, as if offered a pleasant compliment. \nALMA That's nice. Because I love you, too. \nShe puts on a record -- \"It All Comes Back To Me Now.\" It plays throughout the sequence. \nTWO SHOT as Alma comes over to Prew. \nPREW I mean it. I need you. \nALMA (AS BEFORE) I'm glad. Because I need you, too. \nPREW (RECKLESSLY) A thirty-year man is movin all over, goin all the time. Up to now I never thought a thirty-year man had any business to think of gettin married. \nShe stares at him, amazed, a touch angry. \nALMA You're a funny one, little Prew boy. \nPREW (HURT) Yeah. Must be the altitude. \nALMA A very funny one that I cannot figure out. \nPREW Why's it funny if a guy wants to marry you? \nALMA Because I'm a girl you met at the New Congress Club! And that's about two steps up from the pavement. \nPREW Okay -- I'm a private no class dogface soljer. And the way most civilians look at it, that's two steps up from no thin. \nThere is a silence. Alma is honestly distraught. \nALMA Oh, Prew, Prew, I thought we were happy: Why do you want to spoil things? \nPREW Lissen, I ain't think in of now. But I got a plan cookin in my head. You want to go back to the States in a year. Well, you could stretch it some, make it two years. And I could swing a Sergeant's stripes -- If I were a non-com the Army'd let me pick my duty when I re-enlist. (lost in the picture of IT) And there's some posts back in the States -- like Jefferson Barracks -- The married noncoms rate solid brick houses... with lawns with new- cut grass and walks with big old oak trees... \nALMA Now I know you've lost your mind! How do you expect to become a Sergeant under this Captain Holmes of yours? It's all you can do to keep out of the Stockade! \nCLOSE SHOT PREW \nPREW I could fight. \nTWO SHOT \nPREW It I go out for boxin he'd send me to non-com school. The Regimental Championship is next month. I bet I could win the middleweight even without training. I used to be pretty good I could do it. \nAlma is deeply moved. She speaks gravely, sincerely, not at all immodestly. \nALMA No. I don't think you should give in to The Treatment... even to marry me. \nPREW This'd be worth it. \nALMA (ALMOST DESPERATELY) Prew -- it's true we love each other now. But back in America, it might be different... We might not even want each other... \nShe goes out to pantry. We hear the sound of the door to rear porch opening and closing. \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT HOLMES wretched, completely at a loss. He stares into space, then looks down at his food, picks up a fork and ruefully begins to eat. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. BARRACKS - DAY \nMEDIUM SHOT LAWN \nPrew, on hands and knees, is on a weeding detail with three other men, one of them Sal Anderson. Another is PRIVATE NAIR, a tousle-headed, sentimental man we have not seen before. Sergeant Thornhill, in charge of the detail, lolls on the ground, his head propped against a tree, reading a comic book. Prew works his way over to Nair. \nPREW You just get out of the Stockade? \nNAIR (NODS) It was rugged, sam. But I kept my mouth shut and watched my step and I wasn't in no trouble. \nPREW You see Maggio? \nNair nods, tells his tale in half-humorous, half-reverent fashion. \nNAIR Fatso's workin him over with a hoe handle. Places where it won't show mostly. You know, the back and the chest. The kidneys. Once in a while in the face. Know what Maggio does when that happens? Spits in Fatso's eye. (CHUCKLES) Oh, he's a hot one. Ain't he a hot one? \nPREW He's a good boy. \nNAIR Course, he throws up a little blood now and then. And he passes out a lot. But Fatso sure ain't reportin none of that. So there's no way they goin to find out. \nPREW Why don't he go to the C.O.? \nNAIR We tried to get him to. But he won't peep. He says he got a lot more scalp to lose first. That boy is about the hardest artery in the hospital. (with great sentiment) But he's got a heart just like a great big baby. \nPrew's face has been growing in fury. He pulls up a clump of sod, throws it down with all his might. \nPREW You think he's gonna be all right? \nNAIR Your guess is worth mine, sam. Maybe he's crackin a little at that -- cause after Fatso put him in the Hole -- that's what they call solitary -- a couple times he began talkin about how he's gonna e- scape. He said to tell you he'll look you up one of these nights. \nA shadow falls across the grass in front of Prew. \nSHOT GALOVITCH FROM PREW'S POV CAMERA SHOOTING UP from near the ground, the ANGLE EXAGGERATING Galavitch's ungainly, ape-like figure. He looks down at Prew, full of venom. \nGALOVITCH Still on knees, eh, Prewitt? Well, boxing finals next month. December f if teen. You s till got time help us make champions. \nMEDIUM SHOT PREW FROM GALOVITCHE'S POV \nPrew is at the breaking point. Controlling himself, he weeds around Galovitch's shadow. It moves in front of Prew again. \nGALOVITCH'S VOICE Are proud dis Compny to be or not? Bites de hand dat feeds it der shoot dogs for. Infortunately, ony dogs day are allowed to shoot, not men. \nMEDIUM SHOT GROUP The other men have stopped weeding, are looking over at Prew and Galovitch. Thornhill, in b.g., puts down the comic book and comes over to them during following. \nPREW Get outa my way, Ike. I ain't gonna move around you again. \nGALOVITCH You need better lesson than up to now. Maybe I give to you myself. Maybe right now. \nHe steps on Prew's hand. As Prew jerks away from the heavy shoe Galovitch hauls him up by his fatigue shirt. Thornhill steps between them. \nTHORNHILL (TO GALOVITCH) Ey, leave him alone. `e's in my DETAIL -- \nPrew shoves Thornhill aside, cold decision in his eyes. He starts unbuttoning his shirt. \nPREW (TO GALOVITCH) All right. It's gonna be your way. \nGalovitch rips off his shirt, bursting some of the buttons as he does. Stripped to the waist, his whole appearance seems to change; he looks as he did in the ring, a hard-muscled prize fighter. \nTHORNHILL Ey, wait a minute, you guys -- ! \nPrew is barely able to get out of his shirt before Galovitch charges him. \nVARIOUS ANGLES PREW AND GALOVITCH AND SPECTATORS During following men run from across the quadrangle and from out of the barracks to watch the affair, form a circle around \nthe fighters. Prew is a skillful boxer, moving around Galovitch quickly and cleverly. Galovitch is more lumbering but not awkward. His heavy blows stagger Prew several times. Prew drives his attack at his opponent's body. He never throws a punch at the other's head. \nNAIR The head, Prew! Hit him in the head! \nThe other men around shout similar advice. \nCLOSE SHOT GALOVITCH puzzled by Prew's concentration on his body and by the shouts of the men. He seems to be wondering if Prew is pulling a trick. \nCLOSE SHOT PREW A fear, not born of cowardice, is reflected on Prew's face as he sets himself, stares at Galovitch. He seems haunted by the memory of Dixie Wells. \nCLOSEUP GALOVITCH'S EYES \nCLOSEUP PREW flinching without being hit. He seems mesmerized by the other's eyes. \nCLOSEUP GALOVITCH'S EYES \nMEDIUM SHOT PREW AND GALOVITCH fighting. Galovitch draws blood from a cut over Prew's eye. He is getting the better of the battle. In b.g. Thornhill breaks out of the crowd and runs across the quadrangle. \nMEDIUM SHOT BALDY DHOM AND SPECTATOR \nSPECTATOR I don't get it -- Why don't Prew go for the head? \nDHOM He blinded a guy once. Must be scairt of the same thing. \nMEDIUM SHOT PREW AND GALOVITCH as Galovitch batters Prew back against the crowd. A right to the temple sends him to his knees. He shakes his head a moment, gets up and goes into a clinch. \nThornhill steps into the circle, nods toward Anderson. \nTHORNHILL `e's right, sir. (points to Galovitch) `e begun it. Prewitt done nothin. \nFrom the crowd step Sergeants Dhom, Wilson and Henderson. They face Holmes and Galovitch implacably. \nHENDERSON No, sir, this wasn't Prewitt's fault. \nDHOM That's right, sir. Everybody knows Galovitch started it. \nWilson nods. There is a murmur of agreement from the crowd. Holmes looks at his fighters, rocked by this betrayal. They stare back at him. \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT COLONEL WILLIAMS Still near the rear of the crowd, he watches the scene with much interest. \nMEDIUM SHOT Holmes pulls himself together, turns to the crowd. \nHOLMES That's all. Break it off. Let's get back to our jobs. (to Prew and Galovitch; WEAKLY) I'm giving you two a break. I'll ignore this. \nHe walks off. He does not see Colonel Williams. Galovitch moves off toward the barracks. Wilson, Henderson and Thornhill remain grouped around Prew. \nPREW You guys figure this means I'm steppin into a ring, you're wrong. \nEMERSON It's your show, kid. Run it the way you want. \nWILSON You better put same iodine on them cuts. \nDHOM Yeah. An come over to Choy's tonight. We buy you a beer. \nThe non-coms walk off, Prew stares after them. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. CHOY'S - NIGHT \nLONG SHOT ACROSS ROAD PREW CLARK ANDERSON Sounds of gaiety from the beerhouse mingle with the mournful twang of guitars being played by Clark and Anderson. CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY toward the trio until the beerhouse noises are \nlow. The men are surrounded by many empty beer bottles. \nPREW, CLARK AND ANDERSON (SINGING SOFTLY) Woke up sick on Thursday Feelin like my head took a dare Looked down at my trousers All my pockets was bare That girl sure was bad news Re-enlistment Blues... \nThe guitars finish the stanza with a flourish as CAMERA HOLDS on MEDIUM SHOT. The men chuckle. \nCLARK Some day I'm goin back to Scranton and play it for my folks. And tell em it wan composed in the Hawaiian Islands! Clear across the Pacific Ocean! \nPREW (finishes long swig of BEER) Hey, Friday. \nCLARK Yeah? \nPREW Why you called Friday? \nCLARK Don't know. I was borned on Wednesday. (plucks guitar, sings) Went back around on Friday Asked for a free glass of beer... \nThe three laugh, sing in unison. \nPREW, CLARK AND ANDERSON My friends had disappeared Barman said, `Take off, no credit here'... \nMEDIUM SHOT NEAR ENTRANCE TO CHOY'S The music from across the road almost lost in the laughter and shouts from the beerhouse. Warden comes out, wobbles a bit. He has One On. He cups his hand over his ear, straining to hear the singing. He stumbles into Choate, coming along the sidewalk. \nCHOATE Top, you sure plastered. \nWARDEN (MUSTERING DIGNITY) I am off duty. Off duty if I want to get plastered -- \nBut Choate has gone into Choy's. CAMERA RETREATS with Warden as he wanders to the road, still trying to locate the singing. Half-way across the road he unceremoniously sits down, crosses his knees Buddha-wise. Here the singing is more audible. He listens contentedly. \nMEDIUM SHOT PREW ANDERSON CLARK \nPREW, ANDERSON AND CLARK (SINGING) Ain't no time to lose Re-enlistment Blues... \nAnderson, as usual, finishes the stanza with a brilliant display on the guitar. Prew stands up. In the glow of a streetlight his face shows the marks of his battle with Galovitch. He wobbles and we realize he, too, really Has One On. \nANDERSON Where you go in? \nPREW Back to Choy's. Get nother drink. \nThe guitars and singing continues in b.g. through following. CAMERA PANS with Prew as he weaves to the road. \nMEDIUM SHOT MIDDLE OF ROAD as Prew crosses. He can see the seated figure but the light from the street is too dim to identify it. \nWARDEN'S VOICE (BOOMS) Halt! \nPrew stops automatically. \nWARDEN'S VOICE Who goes there? \nPREW A friend. \nWARDEN'S VOICE Advance, friend, and be reconized. \nPrew moves closer, CAMERA WITH him, until he recognizes Warden. \nWARDEN (roaring, laughing) Quiet! At ease! Fall out! Right dress! `bout face! Hit the track! Garbage Detail! Latrine Detail! Dis a drill, not picnic! Hello, kid. Whatever you doin out all by yourself? \nPREW I'm goin to get a drink. \nWARDEN Siddown. I got a bottle. \nMAGGIO (spewing words out) ... done it like I said... e- scape... e-scape like I figgered...

During following Anderson and Clark come over, watch pop-eyed. \nMAGGIO Fatso... Fatso done it to me... yestiday he did it for keeps... He likes to whack me in the gut with a hoe handle an then he asks `that hurt?' and then I spit at him... Ony yestiday he done it ten times runnin an somethin bust... you know, like they was a fish swiminin aroun inside you... \nPREW (TO OTHERS) Come on, let's get him to the hospital. \nMaggio grasps him tighter. He is crying now. \nMAGGIO Prew... they gonna send you to the Stockade...? \nPREW No, Angelo -- \nTWO SHOT MAGGIO AND PREW \nMAGGIO (PLEADING) Should they do, watch out for Fatso! You gotta make like it's a game... He'll try to crack you but you ain't gonna crack... He's gonna see you but he'll never see you saw... `n' when he puts you in the Hole you just lay there `n' be still... `at's the ony way -- be still... `n' remember things... but not people. Not people! Things like nature... woods you been in... trees is awys good... \nHe goes limp in Prew's arms, slides to the road. \nGROUP SHOT Warden bends over Maggio. The others watch, scared. \nCLOSE SHOT PREW staring down at Maggio. \nGROUP SHOT Warden looks up. \nWARDEN He's dead. \nCLARK Dead? But he was here just a minute ago. \nPrew bends over, picks up Maggio, holds him in his arms gently, unbelieving. \nSTARK Fatso's lucky. They'll figure he got killed fallin out of that truck. \nPREW He ain't dead. \nCAMERA MOVES AHEAD of Prew as he carries Maggio to the jeep, the others following. He lifts Maggio into the rear of,the jeep. Warden puts his hand on Prew's arm. \nWARDEN He's dead, Prew. \nPrew stares at Maggio, lying in the jeep. Stark gets into the front of the jeep. \nSTARK I'll take him, Prew. \nHe starts the motor. Prew leans over, moves Maggio's body a little. \nPREW (TO STARK) See his head don't bump. \nThe jeep drives off. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. BARRACKS AREA - NIGHT \nLONG SHOT Framed beautifully in the moonlight, the Quadrangle and Barracks area look like a college campus. Silence. No movement. \nLONG SHOT ANOTHER ANGLE A figure can be seen far in b.g, at the Bugler's post beside the megaphone. Another figure stands near him. The silence continues, then is broken by the sound of the bugle beginning \nTaps. The first note is incredibly clear and loud and certain. It is held longer than most Buglers hold it. The second note is daringly short, abrupt. The last note of the first phrase rises, peals out, heartfelt. Two men come into the shot, smoking. They stop, turn toward the Bugler, listen attentively. One of them flips away his cigarette. The Taps continues through the following. \nINT. SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT \nFULL SHOT Most of the men turn in their beds toward the sound of the bugle. Some prop up on their elbows. \nCLOSE SHOT CHOATE as he listens. A look of mingled longing and satisfaction. \nCLOSE SHOT LEVA listening. A strange look of pride. \nCLOSE SHOT MAZZIOLI listening, his face also betraying emotions normally concealed. \nMEDIUM SHOT TREADWELL AND ANDERSON listening. Their bunks are next to each other. \nTREADWELL (a reverent whisper) I bet you it's Prewitt... \nEXT. PORCH ON BARRACKS - NIGHT \nMEDIUM SHOT Three men come out of the barracks, lean over the porch rail, listening. Their faces are thoughtful, sad. \nINT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nMEDIUM SHOT WARDEN The office lit only by a light over his desk. He is working late, a sheaf of papers spread out before him. He listens to the bugle call, moved, sorrowful. He snaps off the light, listens in the darkness. \nEXT. QUADRANGLE - NIGHT \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT PREW at the Bugler's post. He is finishing the last phrases, full and wonderful. Behind him stands Friday Clark, motionless. The final note quivers to silence. Prew swings the megaphone for the repeat. Then the repeat begins, the clear proud notes reverberating across the silent quadrangle. \nINT. WARDEN'S ROOM OFF SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT KARELSEN lying on his back in his bunk, arms clasped behind his head. He listens, his gnarled face the picture of the old soldier. He breathes heavily as if he is hearing his own requiem and epitaph. \nEXT. PORCH ON BARRACKS - NIGHT \nMEDIUM SHOT There are eight or nine men here now, listening. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. ALMA'S HOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nMEDIUM SHOT PREW AND ALMA Alma is reading a newspaper in b.g. Prew is disheveled and slovenly, needs a shave badly. His face is lined with pain. He is drunk from several days of steady drinking, stone drunk, as if in a trance. He wears crumpled civilian clothes. He is at a table laboriously writing out the Re-enlistment Blues. He finishes writing a stanza and sings softly. \nPREW Slep in the park that Sunday Seen all the folks gain to church Your belly feel so empty When you're left in the lurch -- \nAlma looks up from the paper. \nALMA Here it is -- they're putting it on an inside page already. (READS) `... still no clue in the fatal stabbing of Staff Sergeant James R. Judson...' \nPrew, who has stopped singing but not turned his head, resumes the song. \nPREW Dog soljers don't own pews Re-enlistment Blues... \nALMA (ANNOYED) Did you hear me? Are you listening or not? \nPrew nods blankly. He rises slowly and walks across the room toward Alma. But his eyes are fixed on a whisky bottle on a table beside her. He moves stiffly, favoring his side, his face contorted. He picks up the bottle, pours himself a drink. \nALMA (COLDLY) Are you trying to set a new world's record? \nCLOSE SHOT PREW He smiles faintly, holds the glass high. \nPREW Yeah... To the memory of Robert E. Lee Prewitt, Holder of the New World's Record... \nTWO SHOT PREW AND ALMA \nALMA I want to know what you plan to do. \nPREW Plan to do? When? \nALMA Any time. Now. Tomorrow. Next week. \nPREW Lessee... (counts on fingers) (MORE) PREW(CONT'D) ... One... two... three... four... Four days I'm AWOL, ain't I? (picks up paper, looks at DATE) ... this is December sixth, ain't it...? \nALMA (half-tirade, half-wail) It's December sixth and you're so drunk you're wall-eyed. And all you've done since you fell in here is drink and drink and drink and try to remember that old song of yours. And I want to know what you're going to do! \nPrew looks at her, hurt. He moves back to his table, mumbling. \nPREW ... might ship out on a tramp and go to Mexico and be a cowboy... \nALMA Oh, be sensible! \nPrew sits at the table again, continues to mumble. \nPREW ... I'm goin back to the Compny... soon's my side heals... Goin back under my own power... Goin into the Ordrly Room 'n' say hello, Warden, Private Prewitt reportin... \nALMA (BREAKING) Oh, Prew! Prew! Why did you have to do it? Why did you have to kill that man? \nPrew shakes his head sadly as if he doesn't know the answer. He picks up the paper he has been writing on, sings softly, testing the last couple of lines affectionately. \nPREW Recruitin crews give me the blues Old Re-enlistment Blues... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. MESS HALL - DAY \nFULL SHOT CAMERA FEATURES clock on wall reading 7:52. About half the Company is at breakfast. There is considerable laughter and horseplay. Near the kitchen a dozen men are in the chow line. \nMEDIUM SHOT FEATURING Warden at the NCO table. He rises, carries his plate with him towards the chow line. A sudden, deep-toned, earthquake-like blast shudders through the room. The cups on the tables rattle. Warden stops, cocks his head. The men stop eating, look at each other. \nANDERSON (to the room) Must be dynamitin down to Wheeler Field. \nCHOATE Them engineers mighty ambitious Sunday mornin before eight o'clock. \nThe men resume eating. Warden moves a couple of steps toward the chow line when the second blast hits. It is much heavier and fuller. \nCLOSE SHOT WARDEN He has a hunch about this now. He reaches out to put his plate down, holding it very carefully in both hands. However, he doesn't bother to see if there is anything under it. The plate falls and crashes on the floor a fraction of a second before the third groundswell of blast shakes the room. \nEXT. COMPANY STREET - DAY \nFULL SHOT NEAR MESS HALL A man sprints toward the mess hall, yelling to right and left at the top of his lungs. As he approaches camera we see it is Mazzioli. \nMAZZIOLI The Japs're bombing Wheeler Field! It's the Japs! They're bombing Wheeler Field! The Japs! It's the Japs! I saw the red circles on the wings! \nLONG SHOT SHOOTING UP CIRCLES ON UNDERSIDE OF MOVING PLANE The roar of the plane over shot. \nMOVING SHOT SHOOTING DOWN FROM JAP PLANE PAST PILOT The figure of Mazzioli gets closer and closer as the plane \ndives toward him, machine guns spitting. \nMEDIUM SHOT MAZZIOLI as the Jap plane flashes by close above him. The stones in the pavement pop up. Mazzioli flops on the street. The plane zooms. \nFULL SHOT MESS HALL as the men rush out. In the front ranks are Warden, Karelsen, Stark and Choate, Choate carries his half-filled plate in one hand, a mug of coffee in the other. The men stretch their necks, following the plane. Then they look back up the street, CAMERA PANNING. Far in b.g, a column of black mushrooming to the sky. Warden dashes to Mazzioli. CAMERA MOVES IN to a CLOSE SHOT as Warden bends over him, hoists him to a sitting position. He is extremely gentle. Mazzioli's knee is laid open and is bleeding freely. Warden whips out a handkerchief and starts to apply a tourniquet. \nMEDIUM SHOT Some of the men continue to crane at the sky. A few pick up metal links from the Jap bullets. \nNAIR Say! This'll make me a good souvenir! A bullet from a Jap plane! \nWARDEN This ain't jawbone! This is for record. Theme real bullets that guy was usin. Get inside -- all of ya! \nWarden gets Mazzioli to his feet, turns to first man in group surrounding them. It is Anderson. \nWARDEN Help him over to the hospital. \nMEDIUM SHOT THORNHILL FROM WARDEN'S POV lying under an empty bunk with three mattresses piled on it. He is in his underwear and a helmet, hugs his rifle. \nMEDIUM SHOT THORNHILL AND WARDEN \nWARDEN You'll catch a cold, Turp. \nTHORNHILL Don't go out there, First Sergeant! You'll be killed! They're shootin it up! You'll be dead! You'll not be alive any more. Don't go out there! \nWARDEN You better put your pants on. \nWarden hits the floor as a plane is heard so loud and low it sounds as if it's coming right into the room. A dotted line of bullets crosses the floor and moves into Warden's and Karelsen's room. Warden jumps up and rushes into the room. \nINT. WARDEN'S ROOM OFF SQUAD ROOM - DAY \nMEDIUM SHOT as Warden runs in. Broken glass lies all over the floor. Bullet holes are stitched across the top of Warden's footlocker. He throws back the lid fiercely. His linen is polka-dotted with holes. He tosses out shirts, shorts, etc., digs underneath them. He pulls out a quart bottle of whisky; it is untouched. Warden smiles with relief. He lifts the bottle to his lips, drinks long and heartily. \nEXT. ROOF OF BARRACKS - DAY \nFULL SHOT ROOF About twenty of Company GIs men, including almost all the non- cams, are on the roof, They are crouched behind the chimneys or down on their knees in the corners. The BARs are propped on the low walls or chimney tops, their muzzles pointed to the sky. \nLONG SHOT SHOOTING FROM ROOF TO SKY Three Jap planes, forming a V, are heading straight for camera. \nFULL SHOT MEN ON ROOF \nDHOM (SHOUTING) Come on, you dirty sons -- \nThe scream of the planes drowns Dhom's voice. There is a tremendous clatter as the men fire. The Jap planes pass, untouched. \nFrom this moment on there is no letup of the noise -- there is a wild cacophony of Jap planes, BARs, Karelsen's machine gun, the deep sound of bombs hitting in the far distance. And Chief Choate, singing the Regimental marching song, loudly and lustily. \nANOTHER ANGLE as Warden comes up on the roof through the skylight. He shouts incoherently at the men. They shout back in a wild cheer. They are like a pack of hungry men enjoying their first big meal in years. In b.g. the Jap V has swung about and heads back. Warden grabs a BAR from the roof. \nCLOSE SHOT FLASH JAP PILOT IN LEAD PLANE grinning as his plane dives, its guns roaring. His silk scarf ripples out behind him. \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT WARDEN firing the BAR, standing, as the Jap planes roar over. He staggers back from the recoil. \nFULL SHOT ROOF The men fire in unison. They rise after the planes pass, shake their fists. Henderson and others of the loading detail appear on the roof, bringing up more ammunition. \nCLOSE SHOT FEATURING WARDEN He lets out a hoarse yell of glee and pride. \"These are my boys. This is my Company,\" it seems to say. The men answer back with a great answering shout. \nANOTHER ANGLE Warden makes a tour of the roof, laughing, exhorting, slapping the men on their buttocks like a quarterback. They respond with tremendous spirit; they are having one hell of a time. We get only a snatch of what Warden is yelling. \nWARDEN -- Don't worry about wasting ammo! Throw your empty clips down into the yard. The loading detail will pick 'em up -- \nThe sound of a bugle blowing insistently is now heard, blending into the rest of the noise. Treadwell runs to the edge of the roof, looks over. \nLONG SHOT SHOOTING FROM ROOF TO QUADRANGLE At the Bugler's post, Friday Clark is sounding a call. \nMEDIUM SHOT ON ROOF Treadwell turns, yells at the men. \nTREADWELL Friday's gone crazy! He's blowing the Cavalry Charge! \nEXT. QUADRANGLE - DAY \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT CLARK His cheeks puffed, blowing the bugle madly. \nINT. LIVING ROOM OF ALMA'S HOUSE - DAY \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT PREW He is lying on a couch in pajamas. He has not shaven, his hair is unkempt. A Radio Announcer is heard over shot. Prew wakens, groggy with hangover and near-delirium, wrestles with the blanket over him. CAMERA PULLS BACK to MEDIUM SHOT, DISCLOSING Alma and Gorgette. They have negligees over their nightgowns, are listening to the radio. The Announcer's voice tries hard to be calm and official but he cannot keep the tremor out of it. (NOTE: Transcripts of the actual broadcast have been requested.) \nRADIO ANNOUNCER'S VOICE ... This is a real attack, not a maneuver. The Japanese are bombing Pearl Harbor. Please keep in your homes. Do not go on the streets. I repeat, this is a real attack. Japanese planes are bombing our naval and army installations. Civilians will remain in their homes. This is a real attack - \nThe Announcer's voice goes on as above. \nPREW (MUTTERS) Oh, those dirty Germans... Those dirty sneakin Germans... \nALMA What Germans?! \nPREW (points to the radio) Them... \nGORGETTE It's the Japs. The Japs! \nRADIO ANNOUNCER'S VOICE ... Attacks are now taking place at Pearl, Wheeler, Hickam and Schofield... \nPREW ... dirty Germans... \nAlma shakes Prew, hard. He falls back on the couch, passes out. \nEXT. QUADRANGLE - DAY \nFULL SHOT The Jap strafing attack is continuing. Their planes are making a figure 8 in the sky. Silhouettes of men on the roof can b e seen. Friday Clark is blowing his Cavalry Charge. In b.g. men of the loading detail are scurrying around. Lieutenant Ross runs into shot. CAMERA PANS him across the quadrangle toward the barracks. \nMEDIUM SHOT NEAR BARRACKS Lieutenant Ross is hailed by the loading detail -- about ten men. He grabs a BAR and ammunition from them and runs into the barracks. The loading detail is working feverishly, same carrying ammunition into the barracks, others picking up empty clips as they are thrown from the roof and hustling them toward the Supply Room. \nEXT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY \nMEDIUM SHOT FEATURING LEVA He is working hard, passing out ammunition to members of the loading detail. But he shakes his head dourly as if the whole thing is still very unofficial. \nEXT. ROOF OF BARRACKS - DAY \nFULL SHOT As before, pandemonium -- but controlled and efficient. The men are hoarse from shouting, red-eyed, puffing from excitement and exertion. Two Jap planes swoop past and the full-throated umbrella of fire lets loose. Lieutenant Ross clambers onto the roof, stooping under the burden of the BAR and loading clips. The men greet him with a concerted cheer. \nTWO SHOT LIEUTENANT ROSS AND WARDEN Ross looks around the roof, nods with evident approval, claps Warden on the shoulder. \nDHOM'S VOICE HERE THEY COME, MEN! \nPREP (LAUGHS WILDLY) They'll be throwin `em out of the Stockade. They need every man they can get. \nHe picks up the sheet of paper with the \"Re-enlistment Blues\" written out on it, starts to fold it. Desperation is reflected on Alma's face; she turns to Gorgette, as if pleading for aid, \nGORGETTE Your side'll open up -- \nALMA And they'll find out it was you who killed that soldier! \nPrew shakes his head, as if obsessed by only one thought. \nPREW Once I report in to the Compny I'll be all right. Once I get there. I gotta get back -- \nALMA But you'll never make it! There's MPs all over -- \nPREW I'll make it. I'll go along the back roads. They'll let me in the West gate -- they'll know I'm a SOLJER -- \nHe puts the folded piece of paper in his pocket and starts for the door. \nALMA Stay till morning! \nPrew glances at Alma incredulously. She sobs suddenly, violently. \nALMA Maybe if you stayed till morning you'd change your mind... \nShe throws her arms around him, clings to him. \nALMA Don't go, Prew! I'll do whatever you want... We'll figure out a way to get to the States together... We can even get married... If you go I won't see you any more... I know it... \nPrew holds her closely for a moment, then moves her away from him. He turns toward the door. \nALMA (tears turning to HYSTERIA) What do you want to go back to the Army for?! What did the Army ever do for you? Besides treat you like scum and give you one awful going over and get your friend killed? What do you want to go back to that for? \nPrew frowns as if he's not sure he heard correctly. \nPREW What do I want to go back for? I'm a soljer. \nALMA (LAUGHING WILDLY) A soldier! A soldier! A Regular. From the Regular Army. A thirty- year man! \nPREW Sure. A thirty-year man. (GRINS) With only twenty-six years to go. \nHe opens the door quickly and slips into the darkness. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. HIGHWAY ADJOINING GOLF COURSE - NIGHT \nMOVING SHOT JEEP WITH THREE MPs The night is inky black except for a little moonlight and the \ndimmed headlights of the jeep. CAMERA SHOOTS PAST driver onto the highway as the jeep moves slowly along. The two other MPs clutch Thompson guns, try to scan the dark countryside. \nFIRST MP They say they seen parachutists land up in the mountains. \nSECOND MP I ain't worried about them. Sabatoors is what worries me. \nDRIVER Yeah. Theys the creepy ones. Walkin around just like ordinary civilians. I betcha they operatin all over these islands. \nLONG SHOT SHOOTING FROM SIDE OF HIGHWAY The headlights pass along the road as the jeep moves on out of sight. As its sound fades we hear Prew's heavy breathing, are barely able to distinguish his figure in the darkness. He is crouched, watching the car go down the highway. We hear his thoughts. The voice is labored and agonized. \nPREW'S VOICE (O.S.) ... almost home... ony across the golf course... now... now... no... wait... gotta be care?... gotta sweat it out... \nHe groans, puts his hand to his side. In the feeble light from the moon we see blood on his shirt and hand. He looks up and down the road. \nPREW'S VOICE (O.S.) ... it's clear now... gotta get home... \nStill crouched, Prew starts across the road. \nLONG SHOT OPPOSITE SIDE OF ROAD We see nothing but the strip of road, then Prew+s figure is visible, bent low, weaving a little. As he approaches the camera, he is taught square in the twin beams of dimmed headlights which flash on from the side of the road. Now we see that a jeep is parked near camera, heading in the opposite direction from the jeep which passed before. It is also manned by three MPs. There is a startled cry from Prew. \nMP'S VOICE Halt! \nPrew starts to run back across the road. A white spotlight flashes on, its harsh brilliant light following him. Prew slips to one knee. \nCLOSE SHOT PREW looking toward the jeep, blinded by the blazing light. He has the appearance of a terrified animal. There is a wildness, a senselessness about him. The blotch of blood oozes and spreads over his shirt. He picks up a rock from the road. \nMEDIUM SHOT Prew rises, staggers away from the jeep. \nMP'S VOICE HALT! \nPrew flings the rock desperately toward the lights. There is a crash of glass and one headlight winks off. Prew runs across the road and onto the golf course. \nMEDIUM SHOT JEEP The motor starts, The jeep moves out from its hiding place and starts across the golf course. \nMOVING SHOT SHOOTING FROM JEEP Prew, in a skirmisher's zigzag, is trying to elude the spotlight. He is about twenty yards in front of the jeep. He heads for a high sandtrap. The spot is full on him as he reaches the lip of the trap. He turns, yells something back at the jeep. It is barely heard over the sound of the jeep. \nPREW -- I'm a soljer! -- \nMP That guy ain't no soljer -- he dint HALT -- \nMEDIUM SHOT PREW standing on the lip of the trap, the jeep bearing down on him. He turns, starts to dive into the trap. A blast of gunfire from the jeep hits him. He falls sideways into the trap, rolls over on his back, The jeep moves into the shot, crawls half-way over the trap, stops, its spotlight pouring down on Prew. His eyes are open, looking up to the sky. \nANOTHER ANGLE CAMERA SHOOTS DOWN to Prew from top of trap. A portion of the jeep is in shot, but we are not able to see the MPs. \nMP'S VOICE (quavering, almost TEARFUL) (MORE) MP'S VOICE(cont'd) -- maybe he was a soljer -- I dint mean to kill him -- I dint mean it, guys -- you know we got orders -- \nSECOND MP'S VOICE Shut up. \n", "test1_input": "KAREN I don't know. Maybe a lot. Or maybe you just think there's a lot. \nWARDEN Maybe I do. Maybe there's been a long line of beach parties -- \nKAREN You must be crazy -- ! \nWARDEN Am I? Listen, baby, maybe not here. But what about when you and Holmes were at Fort Bliss? \nKaren flings off the blankets, snatches her dress, stands up, raging. She speaks as she pulls the dress over her head, wriggles into it. \nKAREN I had to go and forget you were a man -- with the same rotten filthy mind the rest of them have. For a minute I had to convince myself you were different -- \nWARDEN Only it's true, ain't it? \nKAREN Yes, it's true! A part of it, some small part of whatever sewage you've been listening to. Some day perhaps you'll get all the story. \nWARDEN (YAPS UP) All what story? \nKAREN You're getting to sound so much like a typical male. So you just sweat it out like a typical male. \nShe starts toward the rocks at the end of the beach, walking fast, then almost running. Warden runs after her. \nMEDIUM SHOT BEACH NEAR PATH UP ROCKS as Warden catches up with Karen. He grasps her arm roughly, hauls her down onto the sand. He stares at her bitterly, waiting f or her to speak. \nKAREN All right. I've never told it to anyone before. But I think now is the time. I'll tell you the whole bloody messy thing. You can take it back to the barracks with you. \nShe speaks rapidly, pouring it out in bursts. For much of the story her face is in shadow, as if a cloud is passing across the moon. \nKAREN I'd been married to Captain Dana E. Holmes two years. Only he was a First Lieutenant then. Back at Fort Bliss. We lived right on a little lake where we could fish and swim and be alone, our 'dream cottage'... I'm sure you must be able to picture it. It was off on a back road, four miles from the highway. Two miles from a neighbor and a telephone.... (pauses, then rushes on) I hadn't been married long when I knew my husband was stepping out on me. But -- you get used to that. Your mother tells you that it's life, that i t happens to a lot of women. Of course, she doesn't tell you until after it happens. \nANOTHER ANGLE FEATURING WARDEN reacting with fury toward Holmes, compassion for Karen. \nKAREN Then, by that time, you're pregnant. And at least you've something else to hope for. I think I was almost happy that night the pains began. Even though they were weeks too early, a whole month too early. I remember Dana was putting on that dapper silk gabardine uniform he used to wear. He was going to an officer's 'seminar.' He was kidding me about false labor. I didn't think it was humorous. I told him to get home early, to bring the doctor with him. He smiled tenderly and told me about the psychic reactions of women to pregnancy. But never fear, he'd be back early. And maybe he would have... if the 'seminar' hadn't been with the hat-check girl in one of the night clubs. \nWARDEN Listen. \nTWO SHOT \nKAREN He was only a little drunk when he came in... at five a.m. He looked alarmed when he saw me. I guess it was because of my screams. I was lying there on the floor, you see -- No, don't say anything. I'm not finished yet. Of course, the baby was dead. It was a boy. But they worked over me at the hospital and fixed me up fine. They even took my appendix out, too. They threw that in free. It was all fine. \nWARDEN Listen. Listen. Please. \nKAREN And, of course, one more thing no more children. Do you know what that means? You're not a woman. You're not anything. You're a gutted shell... Sure, I went out with some of the men after that. A few months of it. I'd been made dirty and I wanted to be clean. You can see that, can't you?... Anyway, I got my revenge on Dana. I kept on living with him. \nWARDEN The hateful, miserable -- \nKAREN You hunt so hungrily for love... love, if you can find it, you think, might give things meaning again. \nWARDEN Listens Listen to me -- \nKAREN All right. I'm listening. \nWarden shakes his head, inarticulate with his rage and love. Karen moves closer to him. \nKAREN I know. Until I met you I didn't think it was possible, either. \nFADE OUT. \nFADE IN: \nINT. DAYROOM - NIGHT \nPAN SHOT AROUND ROOM Over shot soft strumming guitars and two voices singing a quiet blues. There are scattered groups,about fifteen men in all -- playing pool, ping-pong, reading, writing letters, talking. CAMERA REACHES PRIVATE SAL ANDERSON and Friday Clark, playing the guitars and singing. Clark plays only passably, but Anderson is highly accomplished, effortlessly sounding off chord progressions in diminished minors. Friday, the bugler, is about twenty-four, with shy, trusting eyes. Anderson is the same age, also quiet, non-aggressive. CAMERA CONTINUES PANNING, PASSES a soldier reading a newspaper who shakes his head and mutters, \"... ain't it terrible about Lou Gehrig dyin...\", then MOVES IN to HOLD on a group at a window seat, bulling. Prew is stretched out wearily, looks as if he's been through another recent dose of The Treatment. Maggio perches in the frame of the window like an aggressive robin. Treadwell slouches at the end of the seat. Pete Karelsen is in a chair nearby, reading a magazine. \nTREADWELL ... Ah'm in the Army because Ah can live better on the Inside than on the Outside. \nPREW It ain't the reason I'm in. \nMAGGIO Now he's gonna give us that snow about bein a Thirty-Year Man again. \nPREW That's right. Look at Karelsen there. Only seven years more for rockin chair money. \nKarelsen hears his name, looks over. \nMEDIUM SHOT KARELSEN CAMERA AT ANGLE so we see he's reading a full-page advertisement featuring a girl in a revealing negligee. He is feeling sorry for him;elf. \nKARELSEN The Profession wears you down, though, young man. Down thin like a knife what's been honed and honed. All that good steel just rubbed away... \nHe turns back sadly to study the figure of the girl. \nMEDIUM SHOT FEATURING ANDERSON AND CLARK OTHERS IN B.G. Anderson peels off a flourish as he and Clark end their song. \nTREADWELL Man, that's blues! Where'd you drag that one up Prom? \nANDERSON (BASHFULLY) Oh, just stumbled on it. \nHe strums aimlessly again. Prew and Treadwell come over to listen, prop themselves on chairs. During following, several others stroll over and a soldier writing at a desk nearby stops, turns to listen. \nCLOSE SHOT PREW warmed by the friendliness of the music and the moment. \nPREW They got Truckdrivers' Blues... Sharecroppers' Blues... Bricklayers' Blues... We oughta have a Soljers' Blues... \nMEDIUM SHOT GROUP as Anderson repeats a theme he has happened on. It has a haunting melody. \nCLARK Hey, look... I betcha we could make one out of what you just played. Do that again. \n", "test1_true": "ANDERSON I could bring it down to a third line major ending... Regular twelve bars blues. \nTREADWELL I bet I got two hundred blues records back home. (MORE) TREADWELL(CONT'D) But there ain't one could touch that. And that includes Saint Louis. And it could be ours... \nThe men wear pleased smiles, delighted by the idea of possessing something quite rare and truly their own. Prew flips his cigarette into a can. \nPREW I got it. We call it the `Re- enlistment Blues'! \nThere is a chorus of approval. \nPREW Lookit, w e could start it with the guy getting discharged. (reaches over to desk) Hey, fella, can I use this? \nThe soldier at the desk nods, and Prew takes his pencil and paper. He writes down the words of the song as they are composed during following. \nPREW How's this? 'Got paid out on Monday... Not a dog soljer no more... They gimme all that money....' \nHe stops, stuck. Anderson plays the melody and Prew sings the words to this point. Friday Clark chimes in suddenly. \nCLARK 'They gimme all that money... So much my pockets is sore...' \nThey laugh. Anderson sings. Prew writes furiously. \nANDERSON 'More dough than I can use. Re- enlistment Blues...' \nANGLE Anderson plays a series of chords, then repeats the last two lines as the whole group joins in. \nGROUP 'More dough than I can use. Re- enlistment Blues...' \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. GYMNASIUM - DAY \nFULL SHOT Raucous, hammering music sweeps away the melancholy blues. On the floor of the gym Dhom is punching the bag. In a corner of the raised ring Ike Galovitch is skipping rope. In the center of the ring Thornhill and Henderson are sparring. Holmes hovers beside them, issuing instructions in a strident voice. \nMEDIUM SHOT PREW He is in fatigue clothes, on his knees, scrubbing the floor. There is an expression of stubborn hate on his face. Above his head in the shot are Galovitch's feet jumping the rope. In b.g. of shot is Wilson, seated near ring. \nGALOVITCH'S VOICE Some day you get sense in your dumb head, Prewitt, you be up here instead down there! \nA fine spray of spit accompanies the words and showers over Prew but he keeps about his work. \nWILSON Still makin out you like it, huh? \nMEDIUM SHOT IN RING There are two water buckets near Galovitch. He skips near one of them, kicks it. The bucket falls on its side and dirty water spills over the ring and down onto Prew. \nGALOVITCH Clean up dis mess, Prewitt! \nPrew gets to his feet. Galovitch resumes skipping rope. \nGALOVITCH And look a life, hurry it up. You on fatigue detail, not vacation. \nPrew climbs into the ring, gets on his knees, starts to swab up the canvas. He is nearly finished when Galovitch \"accidentally\" kicks over the second bucket. \nGALOVITCH Clean up, Prewitt! \nPrew suddenly stands, no longer able to contain his rage. He throws his sponge and scrubbing brush on the ring floor. \nPREW Clean it up yourself! \nGALOVITCH How? What! \nPREW You heard me -- rub your own nose in it a while! \nGALOVITCH What! \nPrew starts out of the ring. Holmes intercepts him. \nHOLMES What's the matter with you, Prewitt? You know better than to talk back to a non-commissioned officer. \nPREW Yes, sir. But I have never liked being spit at, sir. Even by a non- commissioned officer. \nHOLMES I think you owe Sergeant Galovitch an apology. \nPREW (RECKLESSLY) I don't think I owe him no apology. In fact, I think one's owed to me. \nHOLMES (FURIOUS) Sergeant Galovitch, take this man to the barracks and have him roll a full field pack, extra shoes, helmet and all, and then take a bicycle and hike him up to Kole- Kole Pass and back. And see that he hikes all the way. And when he gets back, bring him to me. \nGALOVITCH Yes, Sirr. \nPrew climbs out of the ring, Galovitch following him. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. ROAD - DAY \nLONG SHOT \nPar below in the shot are Prew, hiking, and Galovitch, riding behind him on the bicycle. The dirt road is steep and the sun pours down, steaming hot. \nMOVING SHOT PREW AND GALOVITCH Prew is hunched under the seventy-pound pack as he plods along. He is sweat-soaked, puffing, dog-weary. Galovitch's bicycle is just behind him; he runs the wheels up on Prew's heels. \nGALOVITCH Move along. You not half way yet. Three more miles to top. \nA jeep rounds a curve a couple of hundred yards above and moves down the road. It slows its speed and pulls up when it nears Prew and Galovitch. \nMEDIUM SHOT The jeep is driven by an enlisted man. Sitting next to him is MAJOR GENERAL SLATER. Galovitch hops off the bike and he and Prew snap to attention. General Slater leans out of the vehicle. He seems puzzled and interested by the odd sight of the two men. \n", "test1_id": 1953, "test2_input": "SHOT as the Reconnaissance car drives through the chain-mesh gate. In the distance is the Stockade, a building that looks something like a country schoolhouse. Music sweeps up as the gate clangs shut. \nWIPE TO: \nEXT. STOCKADE YARD - DAY \nLONG SHOT Maggio walking across the yard flanked by the tall MPs. He looks around as if surveying the chances of escape. Music rises. \nWIPE TO: \nEXT. STOCKADE BUILDING - DAY \nMEDIUM SHOT as the MPs march Maggio up to a door and gesture him to enter alone. He goes in. \nINT. OFFICE OF SERGEANT OF THE GUARD - DAY \nMEDIUM SHOT CAMERA SHOOTS from behind a man seated at a desk. Prominent in shot is a wicked-looking chopped-off hoe handle lying on the desk. Maggio enters, recognizes the man. He walks, up to the desk, his face set in defiance. Music is rising in a fearful crescendo. CAMERA PANS just enough to REVEAL desk sign reading: \"SERGEANT OF THE GUARD.\" The man stands up and the music stops abruptly. \nANOTHER ANGLE REVEALING Fatso Judson as the man, on his face the same murderous expression as at Choy's. He cracks his fingers. \nFATSO Tough monkey. \nCLOSE SHOT MAGGIO his eyes following a movement of Fatso's hand. \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT FATSO Eyes on Maggio, his hand gropes on the desk. \nFATSO Hard sister. \nCLOSE SHOT FATSO'S HAND as it finds and tightens around the hoe handle. The music sweeps in abruptly. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. CLEARING IN VALLEY - DAY (TWILIGHT) \nCLOSE SHOT FLASH A POKER BEING DRIVEN INTO FIRE Music of preceding shot segues into an ancient, savage Hawaiian chant which continues through following. \nCLOSE SHOT FLASH LONG-PRONGED FORK BEING DRIVEN INTO BELLY OF WHOLE ROAST PIG \nCLOSE SHOT FLASH LANG-BLADED CARVING KNIFE SLICING ROAST BEEF \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT STEAM RISING FROM BETWEEN HOT STONES OF FIRE \nFULL SHOT LUAU Shot covers the continuation of all the above activity. This is a native luau - definitely not for tourists. Shot includes long ditches, heated by red-hot stones and lined with layers of banana leaves, containing pig, chicken, rock crabs, fish... Pots of native stew... Bowls of exotic fruit... Peels of raw cane... Working over the food are the natives, many of the men stripped to the waist, the women arrayed in colorful Hawaiian costumes. \nLONG SHOT THROUGH BONFIRE HULA DANCERS A group of male dancers swaying with the insistent beat of a group of old Hawaiian instruments. This is far removed from the night club Hula. This is a thing of swift, agile angularity, primitive and powerful. \nPAN SHOT SPECTATORS THROUGH BONFIRE At end of PAN, CAMERA REVEALS Warden and Karen in the group. They are the only whites in the group. \nCLOSE SHOT KAREN her face lit by the flames. She watches the dancing breathlessly. \nFLASHES TINY TOM TOM NOSE FLUTE GROUP OF MUSICIANS The native instruments playing a thin, weird melody. \nMEDIUM SHOT HULA DANCERS The men laugh and grin as they dance, taunt and tease somebody o.s. \nMEDIUM SHOT SPECTATORS They shout and laugh and squeal with delight as they watch. It is Warden the dancers are teasing. Several of the dancers break out of the group, dance over to Warden, continue to prod him, apparently urging him to join them. \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT WARDEN protesting, joining in the laughter. Suddenly he kicks off his shoes, rolls his slacks up to his knees. He snatches a gardenia from the hair of a pretty Hawaiian girl next to him, sticks it over his ear, jumps into the firelight and dances with the others. The music comes up louder and faster as the spectators and dancers roar. \nGROUP SHOT DANCERS AND WARDEN They are all laughing as they dance, but as Warden moves with them it is apparent he is as good as any of them. \nMEDIUM SHOT SPECTATORS nodding, pointing at Warden, their hilarious laughter fading to delighted smiles. \nCLOSE SHOT KAREN astonished and thrilled at Warden's ability. \nMEDIUM SHOT WARDEN His laughter now also diminished to a happy grin as he dances. In all he dances about thirty seconds. Then he breaks out of the group and runs over to Karen. \nGROUP SHOT FEATURING KAREN AND WARDEN as the spectators and dancers shout their applause. Warden comes up to Karen and puts the gardenia in her hair. Karen is glowing, tingling. \nKAREN You just love to shock people, don't you?! Where on earth did you learn to dance like that? \nWARDEN (PANTING HAPPILY) Believe it or not -- Chicago, Illinois. \nShe flings her arms around him passionately. The onlookers howl with approval and merriment. Between Karen and Warden and camera, an enormously fat Hawaiian woman pours water on the stones in one of the trench-ovens. A cloud of steam rises, hiding them. \nEXT. CLIFF ROAD - DAY (TWILIGHT) \nLANG SHOT VALLEY SHOOTING DOWN a thousand feet into Palolo Valley. Bonfires and smoke rising from the floor of the valley. \nThe thinnest carry of the ancient Hawaiian music. CAMERA PANS from precipice and INCLUDES Prew and Alma as they trudge into shot, climbing up the steep cliff road. \nTRACKING SHOT PREW AND ALMA holding hands as they walk. \nPREW -- If I dint get to see you once in a while The Treatment would've cracked me long ago. \nAlma, fairly winded from the climb, smiles but doesn't answer. \nPREW We could have taken a cab. Except I ain't got cab fare. \nALMA It's just around the bend. \nCAMERA HOLDS as they walk on around a bend in the road. \nEXT. ALMA'S HOUSE \nMEDIUM SHOT The small house is perched precariously on the very edge of the cliff. Alma and Prew come around the bend, come up to the door, Prew marvelling at the house. \n", "test2_true": "She hands Prew her key. As he is unlocking the door: \nALMA I'll get an extra one made for you. \nPrew swings open the door and they go in. \nINT. ALMA'S HOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY (TWILIGHT) \nFULL SHOT Prew stops on the threshold, stares at the room in happy amazement. It is large, smartly furnished. In the rear, glass doors lead to a porch. One of the panelled walls is filled with bookshelves, floor to ceiling. The bookshelves are filled with books. A hearty feminine voice calls \"Hi!\" from the kitchen, and as Prew and Alma come into the room, GORGETTE enters from the kitchen. She is a very tall, very gay, good-looking girl. \nALMA This is Gorgette, my roommate. Gorgette, this is Prew. I told you about him. \nGORGETTE Don't mind me. I'm going out in a little while. \nPrew grins, can't keep his eyes off the astonishing books. Gorgette follows his glance. \nGORGETTE I belong to the Book of the Month Club. I always take every book. That way I get all the dividends. \nShe giggles and goes off to the bedroom. \nPREW She'll be great for Maggio when he gets out of the Stockade. He'll be crazy about her because she's so tall. \nAlma smiles, presses him into a chair. \nALMA Now you just get comfortable and I'll make you a Martini and see what's to cook for dinner. \nShe starts oft to kitchen. \nPREW Hey. \nShe turns. \nPREW This is just like bein married, ain't it? \nALMA (over her shoulder as she exits to kitchen) It's better. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. CLEARING IN VALLEY - NIGHT \nFULL SHOT SHOOTING through smoke rising from one of the trench-ovens. As it clears we see the enormous Hawaiian woman and one or two others cleaning up and putting out the remnants of the fires. The merrymakers and dancers have gone; the luau is over. In b.g., quite alone, are Warden and Karen, sitting on \nthe trunk of a fallen palm tree. \nMEDIUM SHOT KAREN AND WARDEN The abandoned gaiety of the earlier scene gone. They survey the emptiness. The fat Hawaiian woman comes near, rakes ashes over one of the dying fires. She speaks to Warden in Hawaiian. He answers her in the native tongue. The fat woman stares, shrugs, goes off. \nKAREN What did she say? \nWARDEN She said it's over -- time to go HOME -- \nKAREN Home... A beach, a car, a park... \nWarden puts his arm around her tenderly. \nWARDEN It'll work out... \nKAREN It can't go on like this much longer, Milt. \nWARDEN I know. \nHe rises, paces a moment. \nWARDEN If there were only a way! Your lovin husband'd probly give you the divorce. But even if he didn't know what for, he'd never let me transfer. \nKAREN (bucking up courage; QUIETLY) There is a way. I've been thinking about it. \nWarden looks at her apprehensively. \nKAREN You've got to become an officer. \nWARDEN What! \nKAREN You're eligible for the extension course that came in with the draft. When you get your commission they'd ship you back to the States -- new officers aren't kept at posts where they've been enlisted men. Then -- \nWARDEN You sure made a thorough study of it. \nKAREN Then I could divorce Dana and follow you and marry you. \nWARDEN An officer! I've always hated officers. \nKAREN That's a fine, intelligent point of view. Suppose I said I've always hated Sergeants. That would make a lot of sense, wouldn't it? \nCLOSE SHOT WARDEN He sits, thinks it over unhappily. \nWARDEN Okay, suppose I did it. -- And don't think it's a cinch -- the exams are tough. Then you'd be getting your divorce here while I'm in the States. We'd be apart maybe six months! We'll probly be in the war by then -- \nTWO SHOT \nKAREN You can't be certain of that -- \nWARDEN (SNORTS) Put it down on your calendar. On October twenty-third, 1941, Milt Warden told you we'd be in the war in less than a year. \nKAREN (FLARING) Why don't you tell the truth? (MORE) KAREN(CONT'D) You just don't want the responsibility. You're probably not even in love with me -- \nWARDEN You're crazy! I wish I wasn't in love with you. Maybe could enjoy life again. \n", "test2_id": 1954, "test3_input": "ANOTHER ANGLE SHOOTING INTO THE SHADOWS The two figures feint and dart. There is the occasional silver flash of the knives as light hits them. The men go deeper into the shadows, are all but lost to view. There is a startled, pained cry. Then one of the figures falls to his knees and starts to crawl toward camera. \nCLOSE SHOT SHOOTING NEAR GROUND as the figure comes directly to camera, REVEALING the anguished face of Fatso. It slowly turns, is upside down in the frame. \nMEDIUM SHOT Fatso is on his back, his stomach gushing bloods his eyes already glazing. Prew staggers into the light now. His left side has two vicious cuts; he is bleeding badly. He stares down at Fatso, who manages a small, reproving voice. \nFATSO You've killed me. Why'd you want to kill me? \nPrew backs away from Fatso, turns, staggers down the alley away from camera. \nWIPE TO: \nEXT. CLIFF ROAD - NIGHT \nMEDIUM SHOT Prew comes toward camera, laboriously struggling up the road. His side is hemorrhaging steadily, his shirt and trousers blood-soaked. He stops close to camera. He wads his handkerchief, sticks it inside his shirt near the knife wound. He smiles wearily, crookedly. \nPREW (mumbles to himself) Gonna have an awful bad scar there... \nHe lights a cigarette, his fingers shaking. The flame from the match illuminates his left wrist. There is a deep scar on it. It seems to fascinate Prew as he stares at it, rubs his fingers across it. \nPREW ... scars... \nHe turns, moves on up the road; CAMERA MOVES CLOSE behind him, as if overhearing his thoughts which come over on sound track. \nPREW'S VOICE (O.S.) ... got that one fallin off the barn back home... gashed it on a spike...

Gorgette runs to the radio, turns it off. \nCLOSE SHOT ALMA Her face agonized as she leans over Prew. \nALMA Prew! \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT ALMA AND PREW He pushes himself up on one elbow, seems pleased by her stricken expression. He manages a smile. \nPREW (WEAKLY) Don't worry... Ain't gonna die. They savin me for better things... \nGorgette kneels into shot.

GENERAL'S OFFICE - DAY \nMEDIUM SHOT GENERAL SLATER COLONEL WILLIAMS HOLMES The American flag, the General's flag and the Division flag are the only colorful elements in a rather severe office. Colonel Williams is reading from a typed report. \nCOLONEL WILLIAMS --- In addition to inefficiency in administering his command and neglect of duty, Captain Holmes has been guilty of indefensible cruelty to the aforesaid Private Prewitt. This extended to instigating and encouraging wholly unauthorized and discreditable tactics to force the soldier to join the inter-regiment boxing team. These findings are the result of personal investigation by the Inspector General and are corroborated by numerous members of G Company. \nColonel Williams puts his report on the General's desk. Holmes' face reflects a weary resignation as if underneath he has really expected something like this for a long time. He makes no move to speak. The General is angry clear through. \nGENERAL SLATER I'm waiting for your reply to this. \nHOLMES I haven't any, sir... The charges -- are true. \nGENERAL SLATER Holmes, the first thing I ever learned in the Army was that an officer takes care of his men. It seems to be the first thing you forgot. It's monstrous to think of anybody like you in command of troops. And believe me, you won't be for long. My only regret is that we have to keep you in uniform until a court martial is concluded. (MORE) GENERAL SLATER(cont'd) In the meantime, of course, I'm relieving you of your present duties. \nHe indicates the meeting is over. Holmes rises, is about to leave, pauses. \nHOLMES If there were any way to avoid a court martial, sir. Any way... \nThe General frowns, is unresponsive. Holmes looks to Colonel Williams helplessly. \nCOLONEL WILLIAMS There is one alternative, General... if you're so disposed. A resignation for the good of the service under AR 600-275. \nGENERAL SLATER (thinks a moment) I'll give you a chance you don't deserve, Holmes. Write a letter of resignation and have it on my desk this afternoon. I'll consider accepting it. Only because as far as I'm concerned, the quicker you're out of the Army the better for everybody. Especially the Army. \n", "test3_true": "INT. KAREN'S BEDROOM - DAY \nMEDIUM SHOT KAREN AND HOLMES He confronts her, waving a sheet of stationery. His voice is strangled, almost hysterical. \nHOLMES --- that's right, it's a letter of resignations I'm through! I've already been relieved! So you can begin packing. We're sailing for the States next week! \nShe shakes her head, not wanting to believe; she takes the letter out of his hand, starts to read it. She stops after a sentence or two. Her hand falls to her side. Holmes sits on the bed heavily. The bluster bleeds out of him. He shakes his head, emotionally bewildered. For perhaps the first time in his life he is nakedly honest. \nHOLMES Where has it gone, Karen? What happened to it? The gay, cheerful life we were going to have, you and I...? What happened to me...? The proud, dashing officer was going to be. The leader of men?... I've known all along how the men felt about me. They despised me... What's happened? I don't remember losing anything... Where has it all gone? \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT KAREN reacting; she is surprised, a little afraid of her own emotion. The outcry, so lost, so despairing, moves her. She is sorry for him. \nMEDIUM SHOT HOLMES AND KAREN \nHOLMES Karen -- you're coming back with me, aren't you...? \nTrembling, Karen puts the letter on the dressing table. Abruptly, she runs out of the room. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - DAY \nCLOSE SHOT DESK FEATURING placard reading LIEUTENANT ROSS. We hear Ross' first few words over this, then CAMERA PULLS BACK to MEDIUM SHOT. Ross is forceful, clean-cut, gives the impression of toughness but fairness. As he talks he takes down the photographs of prize fighters and prize fighting from the wall. Watching and listening are Sergeants Dhom, Thornhill, Henderson, Leva, Stark and Karelsen and Corporal Wilson. Ross is such a complete switch from Holmes that the men are almost unnerved by him. But a definite respect is reflected in their expressions. Warden, beside his desk, shares this. \nROSS -- I don't intend to have a sloppy outfit. I don't intend to have a goldbrick outfit. I don't intend to have a soft soap outfit. I've called you noncoms in because you're the backbone of any Company. (MORE) ROSS(CONT'D) From now on you'll have to prove you're entitled to have those stripes here. And not in the boxing ring. \nHe bands the pictures to Leva. \nROSS Get rid of these, Sergeant. \nLEVA Yes, sir. \nROSS That's all I have to say. If you've any questions, speak up. \nNobody speaks. \nROSS Dismissed. \nThe men troop out, passing camera. As last man leaves, CAMERA IS ON Warden. He is looking at Ross with considerable approval, even admiration. He resumes a more normal expression as Ross turns toward him. \nWARDEN One non-com was missing, sir. Sergeant Galovitch. \nROSS I know. Private Galovitch is in the kitchen. \nWARDEN In the kitchen? \nROSS As of now, he's an assistant cook. I busted him. On a blanket charge of inefficiency. What are you grinning at? \nWARDEN (GRINNING) I think the Company Commander made a wise decision, sir. \nThe phone rings. Warden goes to his desk, answers. \nWARDEN (INTO PHONE) Compny G, First Sergeant Warden speaking. \nKaren's voice is heard on the phone; we cannot understand what she is saying, but a flood of words pours through. With Ross looking on, Warden is embarrassed. \nWARDEN (INTO PHONE) Yes... Yes, I know... (glances over toward Ross) Yes, the - uh - parcel has already arrived... Yes... What?... (GRIM NOW) No. No, we'll have to talk about it soon. Right away. I - I don't know... \nRoss perceives Warden's distress. He starts toward the door. Warden nods gratefully. Ross smiles, leaves the room. \nWARDEN (INTO PHONE) Lissen, I'll get away somehow, tonight. I'll meet you in Kuhio Park. At eight... Right.... \nHe puts down the receiver. He stares at the desk. Then he slowly pulls out the top drawer. The Officers Application Blank is lying on top of a pile of other papers. He takes it out, looks at it somberly. CAMERA MOVES IN to an INSERT of the Application. We see Warden's answers to sex, age, race, etc. CAMERA MOVES DOWN the page to the place for the signature of the applicant. It is unsigned. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. KUHIO PARK - NIGHT \nLONG SHOT In b.g. Warden, in uniform, and Karen are sitting on the same bench as in their first meeting in the park. We cannot hear what they are saying at first. CAMERA MOVES IN past a few pedestrians and HOLDS on a MEDIUM SHOT. There is a defeated, tired look about them, as if they have been talking for a long time to no avail. \nKAREN ... I guess I felt it that night I asked you to become an officer. When you didn't say yes right away. (MORE) KAREN(CONT'D) I guess I knew deep down you wouldn't do it. But -- (a hint of tears) It seemed such a simple plan for us... \nWARDEN I wanted to -- I tried -- but I couldn't... \nHe runs his hand through his hair. He seems to be groping inside himself for some way to explain. \nWARDEN Lissen -- there's a kid in our outfit named Prewitt... Robert E. Lee Prewitt... He came in from the States about a year ago. I thought he was a fresh punk at first... until I got to know him a little. He's AWOL right now -- probly in some kind of real trouble -- he ain't the kind to go AWOL otherwise. Anyway, I keep remembering somethin he said to me the first day he came in. He said a man has got to go his own way... if he don't, he's nothin... I'm an Enlisted Man. I'm a First Sergeant. Milt Warden. Once I cross that line and tried to be an officer, I'm somebody I don't know. A stranger. And a man has got to be what he is... \nKAREN I guess that's the trouble with Dana... He's always tried to be something he isn't. Poor Dana... I don't think he ever needed me until now. (shaken herself out of it) Well, here we are saying goodbye. And talking about two other people. \nWARDEN We're not saying good-bye -- we'll figger out a way for you to stay HERE -- \nKAREN I'm going back with him, Milt. There's something in being needed. It isn't love. But it's something. \nWARDEN (DESPERATELY) Lissen, two people who love each other just don't stop loving each other! Nothin and nobody is goin to break us up l 1111 transfer out somehow and get back to the States. Maybe it'll take a little time but I'll do it! \nKAREN (SMILES) That sounds like Milt Warden, all right. \nHe bends toward her to kiss her. She presses him back. \nKAREN No, Milt. I don't want to kiss you any more. I just want to remember you. And you to remember me. \nWARDEN Put it down. Put it down that on December 6th, 1941, Milton Anthony Warden told you he'd remember you... \nCAMERA PULLS BACK, PASSES a few pedestrians, Warden and Karen remaining in b.g. of shot. They begin to talk again, quietly, undemonstratively. We are too far away now to hear what they are saying. \n", "test3_id": 1955}

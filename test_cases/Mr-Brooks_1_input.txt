Mr. Brooks lets himself in with a key. 
INT. BUILDING Ñ NIGHT 
Exquisitely unique handmade handglazed bowls, vases, cups, plates are scattered haphazardly on shelves and tables around the room. 
This is Mr. Brooks's CERAMICS STUDIO. 
Mr. Brooks turns on the big industrial kiln and sets the temperature, then in a series of quick cuts changes out of his tuxedo into his work clothes which he selects from a dozen identical pairs of khaki shirts and pants hanging in a closet. 
Below the pants and shirts are a dozen pairs of identical leather work shoes. The windbreaker he puts on is also from a dozen identical windbreakers. 
He takes a set of car keys off a hook next to a door which opens into a garage. Under the light is an older model non- descript Toyota. 
EXT. CERAMICS STUDIO Ñ NIGHT 
The Toyota backs into an alley and with the garage door closing behind it, pulls away. 
INT. TOYOTA Ñ NIGHT 
Marshall is up front with Mr. Brooks. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MARSHALL Oh Lordy, Earl my boy, I've missed this! We are going to have so much fun! 
MR. BROOKS This is the last time, Marshall. Understand me?! The very last time! 
EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET Ñ NIGHT 
A mixture of modest houses and apartment buildings. Mr. Brooks's Toyota is parked in the semi-dark cast by a tree. 
We rise over the car, over the trees, over the houses to the other side of the block and come down to find Mr. Brooks working the lock on the side door of a small BUNGALOW. 
He has on surgical gloves. 
The pick is extracted, the handle turned. The door opens. There's a chain. 
Mr. Brooks removes a pair of bent rubber tipped forceps from a pocket, inserts it in the chain, pulls the door to, gives the tool a twist and gently pushes the door inward. 
The chain has been released. 
INT. BUNGALOW Ñ NIGHT 
Mr. Brooks quietly closes the door and holding his breath stands very still and listens. 
There's a faint indistinct sound coming from the recesses of the house. 
Mr. Brooks's feet glide out of the PANTRY. Now coming slightly behind him is another pair of legs encased in dark slacks. 
Move up; the person in the black slacks is Marshall. 
In the middle of the KITCHEN, the sound is now recognizable. It's the moans of a Couple fucking. This disturbs Mr. Brooks, he hesitates. 
Marshall leans in and hisses fiercely in his ear. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MARSHALL Don't you dare quit on me, you piece of shit. I want to see what they're doing. 
Mr. Brooks's spine stiffens and he's going forward again. 
Entering a HALLWAY, he reaches into his jacket. When his hand reappears it's inside a Ziplock bag, his fingers around the butt of a silenced pistol. 
He brings the hand and bag to his mouth and tightens the Ziplock against his wrist. 
The two Men arrive at a door that's slightly ajar. Behind it the sounds of the love-making are becoming more intense. 
Mr. Brooks nudges the door with his foot. It opens enough for he and Marshall to see the Couple inside. 
The Man and Woman from the Arthur Murray dance class are naked on the bed. 
As much as Mr. Brooks hates himself for it he loves watching. He can now hear his heart beating in his ears. 
He begins to breathe in unison with the Couple, but his expression is distant almost clinical. 
When the Couple climaxes, when they come, Mr. Brooks's face goes blank. 
On the bed the Woman rolls off her Partner and the two of them lie there basking in the afterglow. 
Behind them Mr. Brooks pushes the door fully open and slips into the ROOM. They don't know he's there until he speaks. 
MR. BROOKS Hello. 
Both the Man and Woman jump with surprise and look. The Woman screams and scrabbles at the sheet to cover herself. 
MAN What the fuck?! 
Then he sees the gun. 
MAN Hey, man, don't...

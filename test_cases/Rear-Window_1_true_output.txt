JEFF (Grunts) Uh-huh. 
She begins putting her equipment back into her black bag. Jeff's eyes lift to the salesman's apartment, and the amusement drains from his face. He leans forward a little, tensely. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT 
The salesman has his aluminum case on the table near the center of the room. He is carefully wiping out the interior with dust cloth. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP 
Jeff watching intently. Stella putting the last of her things into her bag. 
STELLA And don't sleep in the chair again. 
Jeff continues to what the salesman, his face showing a great concentration of thought. 
JEFF Uh-huh. 
Stella picks up her bag, stares at Jeff's back a moment, then starts for the door. 
STELLA Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Great conversationalist. 
Jeff swings half-way around in his chair just as Stella reaches the top of the steps. 
JEFF Stella. 
She turns around. Jeff points to a coat-stand near the door. 
JEFF (Goes on quickly) Will you take those binoculars out of the case and bring them to me. 
She puts down her bag, reaches for the binoculars, takes them out the case. She comes down the stairs, brings them to him. He immediately swings to the window, and lifts them to his eyes. Stella sniffs, then goes to the door, as she says: 
STELLA Trouble. I cam smell it. I'll be glad when they crack that cast, and I get out of here. 
As Stella goes out the door, the CAMERA MOVES IN until Jeff's head, and the binoculars, are filling the screen. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT 
The salesman has completed his cleaning of the case. He is in the act of placing it on the floor. He turns and again glances out of the window. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP 
Jeff quickly lowers the binoculars and edges back a few inches. He watches a moment, then cautiously lifts the binoculars again. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - SEMI-LONG SHOT - (DAY) 
The man is now moving out of the living room, and the binoculars PAN him though to the small kitchen which is seen through a side window. 
The man starts to busy himself in this kitchen with his back to us, but the image is very unsatisfactory. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP 
Jeff lowers the binoculars and there is an expression of exasperation on his face. He throws the binoculars down, and then looks about him. He backs his chair up quickly toward the main cabinet on his left. He leans down, opens a cupboard door and takes out a long-focus lens. Then from a shelf above he takes a small Exacta camera. He quickly takes off the existing lens and puts on the telephoto lens in its place. He wheels himself back to the window and raises the camera to his eye. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - CLOSE SHOT 
Through the view-finder of the camera, we are now brought into close proximity with the salesman in his little kitchen. His back is still to us. He half-turns and takes a used newspaper. He spreads it open, along the drainboard. From the sink he takes out a large butcher's knife, and a long, narrow saw. They disappear from sight as he lays them on the newspaper and proceeds to wrap them up. Having completed his job, he emerges from the kitchen carrying the newspaper- wrapped parcel. 
For a moment he is lost behind the wall that separates the kitchen recess from the living room. He does not reappear for a moment. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP 
Jeff lowers the camera for a moment, and watches tensely. Suddenly he puts it up to his eye again. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - CLOSE SHOT 
Half of a man's body is now seen in the living room. 
Then the salesman turns and moves to the center of the room. He is not carrying anything. He sits down on a couch, with a display of fatigue. He yawns and stretches out of sight at full length on the couch. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP 
Jeff lowers the camera. He watches the living room for a moment. Then his eye travels briefly back to the kitchen; then return to the living room. His brow knits a little as we: 
FADE OUT: 
FADE IN: 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - CLOSEUP 
The thermometer outside of Jeff's window, registering 83 degrees. The CAMERA PANS OFF to the left until it comes to rest on the song-writer's studio. He is dressed only in bathing trunks, and is vigorously cleaning his rug with a carpet sweeper. In the middle of his sweeping, he stops, hurries a step or two to the piano. He plays a couple of notes with one hand, while he stands. 
Listens, plays them again. Decides they are no good, and returns to his carpet sweeping. 
THE CAMERA PANS FARTHER LEFT to the salesman's apartment. There are no lights burning behind the drawn shade of the bedroom, but the living room and the kitchen are lighted. There is no sign of the salesman. 
THE CAMERA CONTINUES ITS PAN to the left, to include the couple who sleep on the fire escape in the hot weather. 
We now get an opportunity to examine these people more closely. The man is balding, and middle-aged. He is wearing striped pajamas. He is in the act of laying out the mattress. His wife is slightly younger, peroxided, faded show girl type. Also wearing pajamas, with a fluffy handkerchief in the left pocket, the wife is leaning over the railing holding onto the rope which leads to the dog's basket now on the floor of the courtyard. Having been a one-time siffleuse, her call to the dog is clarion and melodic. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT 
The little dog emerges reluctantly from the shadows, and steps into the basket. It begins to move upward, and THE CAMERA FOLLOWS it. When the basket reaches the fire escape, THE CAMERA PANS ON to the apartment of Miss Torso. She is in the bathroom brushing her long hair, while her thoughts seem to be far away. 
THE CAMERA DROPS DOWN to the apartment below, occupied by the elderly lady with the hearing aid. For the first time we see something of her activities inside the apartment. She wears a short smock, although her legs are still bare. She is hard at work on a piece of abstract sculpture. It takes the form of a piece of mahogany through which a simple hole has been carved. 
THE CAMERA MOVES ON much farther to the left, and eventually comes to rest on the newly-weds' apartment with the shade still drawn. 
It MOVES ON and at last passes though Jeff's window, and comes to rest on the two bid heads of Jeff and Lisa. 
Her lips are brushing lightly against his cheek as she speaks: 
LISA How far does a girl have to go -- before you notice her? 
Jeff moves his eyes slightly to something outside the window. 
JEFF If she's pretty enough, she doesn't have to go anywhere. She just has to "be". 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT 
The salesman's apartment, just as we saw it a moment ago. The shades drawn and lights out in the bedroom, the shade up and lights on in the living room and kitchen. Still no one in sight.

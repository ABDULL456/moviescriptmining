SARA Joe? 
CID Cause he can't stay awake all the time. 
SARA He isn't our business. 
CID He's keeping us safe 
SARA Baby. Let's do this now. You have 32 there, I know you know this one. 
CID I want to help him. Sara is distracted by a distant bell-like DINGING. 
SARA Cid. 32. She goes to the window, looks out, nervous. But it's just a loose LAUNDRY LINE down in the yard, whipping in the wind against its metal pole. In the distance, Joe paces the yard. Relieved, Sara returns to Cid. He sets the tile, petulant. 
SARA (CONT'D) No. Eight times three is what? 
CID Thirty two. 
SARA Eight times three is what? 
CID Thirty two. 
SARA I want you to count three eights. 
CID Eight. Sixteen. Thirty two. 
SARA Are you telling me you want alone time? 
CID No. 
SARA Okay. Why don't you put that where it belongs? Deliberately, Cid lifts the tile and sets it straight back down on the same spot. 
SARA (CONT'D) Alone time. 
Then like a knife in a fist fight: 
CID He's protecting us cause you can't do it. 
SARA Ok. I told you to stay away from 
HIM 
CID I never did anything 
SARA Do you think I'm stupid? 
CID So? 
SARA I told you already Cid is building into a temper tantrum fast. 
CID So? 
SARA You do what I tell you 
CID You can't tell me what to do you're not my mom. (a deadly beat) You're not my mom! You're a liar and you're gonna get killed and you won't stop lying! Cid lunges at her, Sara slaps him back. Not hard, but Cid scoots back, eyes furious. 
SARA 
CID BABY 
CID You're a liar! Liar! I hate you because you're lying! I hate you! Liar! You're lying to me! Sara scoots back. 
SARA 
CID 
CID You're lying!

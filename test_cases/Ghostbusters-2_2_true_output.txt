The Ectomobile is parked at the curb and a curious crowd looks on as the Ghostbusters enter the store. 
INT.  ORREFORS GLASS STORE - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
All the precious crystal is floating in the air, several feet above the glass shelves and display tables.  Stantz and Venkman are talking to the manager while Winston and Spengler set up an array of electronic devices positioned in each corner of the store. 
On a signal from Stantz, Spengler and Winston switch on the devices which throw laser-type beams around the perimeter of the store.  The manager watches in horror as all the GLASSWARE suddenly drops out of the air, SMASHES through the GLASS SHELVES and SHATTERS on the display tables. There is a long pregnant pause. 
STANTZ (to the manager) So will that be cash or a check?

INT.  MUSEUM - RESTORATION STUDIO - DAY (LATE AFTERNOON) 
Everyone else has gone home.  Dana is cleaning her brushes and putting her supplies away. 
VIGO PAINTING - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
Vigo turns his head and watches Dana as she walks past the painting. 
DANA 
She stops, vaguely aware of the movement, and looks up curiously at the painting.  As she starts to walk on, Vigo looks at her again, but Dana turns suddenly and catches the movement.  Frightened now, she hastily leaves the studio. 
INT.  FIREHOUSE - DAY 
Louis is lurking behind a pillar, peeking out at the office area.  We PAN DOWN TO the floor and see a foot pedal, then PAN ALONG the cord TO a ghost trap sitting on Louis's desk.  Hanging from strings over the desk are several pieces of Kentucky fried chicken. 
WALL 
Slimer partially emerges and furtively sniffs the air, then spots the chicken bait.  He licks his lips, materializes completely and flies to the chicken. 
LOUIS 
His eyes light up and he stomps the foot pedal. 
LOUIS (shouts) Gotcha! 
DESK 
The trap pops open and shoots out a powerful cone of energy.  Slimer dodges it and escapes as a big section of the ceiling comes crashing down on Louis's desk. 
LOUIS (seeing the damage) Uh-oh. 
He slinks off, defeated.

INT.  MANHATTAN MUSEUM OF ART - SECURITY DESK - DAY 
The Ghostbusters commercial is playing on a portable TV on the security desk.  Rudy, the Security Guard, is reading a National Enquirer with a giant front-page headline: GHOSTBUSTERS SAVE JUDGE.  Venkman enters. 
VENKMAN I'm looking for Dana Barrett. 
SECURITY GUARD Room 304 -- Restorations. (recognizing him) Hey!  Dr. Venkman -- 'World of the Psychic.' I'm a big, big fan.  That used to be one of my two favorite shows. 
VENKMAN (flattered) Thanks.  What's the other one? 
SECURITY GUARD 'Bass Masters.'  It's a fishing show.  Ever see it? 
VENKMAN Yeah, really great.  Take it easy. 
He exits. 
INT.  MUSEUM - RESTORATION STUDIO - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 
Dana is working on a valuable Flemish still-life by Ver Meer.  Janosz is at the other end of the room, still working on the painting of Vigo. Venkman enters and sneaks up behind Dana. 
VENKMAN (looking at the Ver Meer) So this is what you do, huh? 
DANA (glad to see him) Oh, hello, Peter. 
VENKMAN You're really good, you know. 
DANA I didn't paint it.  I'm just cleaning it. It's an original Ver Meer.  It's worth about ten million dollars. 
VIGO 
He turns his head and watches Venkman and Dana.

LUKICH (on phone) We don't know what happened to him, Branca. Ya, she's gonna be alright. 328B   INT. BRANCA'S SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT Branca, a bodyguard next to him, grimly puts down the phone.

330   EXT. BRANCA'S SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT Branca and a bodyguard come forward, grabbing Nico as Nico almost collapses. 
BRANCA Jesus Christ! 
NICO The motherfuckas got Jackson. BRANCA Lukich called. She's not dead. She's gonna make it. She was wearing a vest. Nico can't believe it. In spite of it all, life comes to him. A little smile... NICO That broad didn't trust me. CUT TO: 331   EXT. BRANCA'S SAFE HOUSE - POV FROM WINDOW - NIGHT

BRANCA Don't worry, they're booked on an early plane. They'll be out of the country tomorrow.

Sara rushes to Nico's side.    Nico reaches for her, but         * the pain stabs him. SARA                                     * Oh my God, Nico!                                       * Rosa starts forward, her face in agony at the sight of her wounded son. BRANCA He's fine.   The boy has ribs of steel! 
ROSA (touching Nico's brow) Enough of your humor. Sara clings to Nico's arm, tears in her eyes. Rosa               * crosses herself. Sara begins to weep. The doctor finishes.       * There's a long awkward moment. Then: 
BRANCA (to doctor and bodyguards) Leave them. Leave them alone. 
QUICK DISSOLVE TO: 338   INT. FAMILY ROOM - LATER 
Rosa sits in a chair. Nico on the couch, holding Julian. Sara faces him. Tears have stained her cheeks, but she           * is in control of her emotions now.                               *

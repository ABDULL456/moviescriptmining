BRAIN Just one thing right now.  Don't call me "Harold." 
EXT. BUILDING -- NIGHT Snake, Maggie, Cabbie and Brain all walk out. 
SNAKE So you work for this Duke, huh? 
BRAIN Yeah.  Make gas for him.  Figure out things for him. 
SNAKE Like what? 
BRAIN (showing off) Like how to get across the 69th street bridge -- it's mined, but I know where they're planted. 
MAGGIE We got a diagram from a guy that got all the way across . . . before they shot the poor bastard. 
BRAIN We got a crew up there now clearing the way across the first barricade. 
CABBIE What a sight, Snake!  The whole camp rolling right across the bridge and the President right out front!  Oh, that would have been so fine . . . 
MAGGIE (ironically) Yeah, it would have been . . . 
CABBIE Yeah, but we're going with Snake now. 
The three of them cross into the street.  Cabbie panics. 
CABBIE That's the Duke!  I know the sound of his engines.  Don't cross the Duke -- everybody knows that. 
We get one glimpse of the Duke's car.  Then we realize that Cabbie is gone and his cab is racing away. 
MAGGIE Cabbie, you slime! 
The Duke's car heads right for us. 
MAGGIE No, Brain! 
The two of them run off.  After a while, Snake follows.  The three of them hide.  The Duke's car is an old Chrysler with chandeliers suspended over the headlights.  It's in a caravan of three, leading the way.  A fourth car comes up later.  The Duke is sitting in the passenger seat of a car with Weirdo in the back.  The Duke gets out of the car, Weirdo at his side.  The Duke is wearing a cowboy hat, sunglasses, a snazzy jacket, bluejeans, and boots.  He looks TOUGH.  He sends Weirdo to knock on the door. 
MAGGIE He's looking for you, Brain. 
SNAKE What does he want?

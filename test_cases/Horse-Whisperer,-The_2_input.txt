ANNIE Yeah. 
ROBERT What did he say? 
ANNIE No. 
Robert nods. Accepting. Silence. Annie sips her wine. Then: 
ROBERT I was thinking... Maybe we should think about the three of us going someplace warm... Remember that house we rented in Bermuda... The pink one with the -- 
His arm accidentally spills the wine. 
ROBERT Shit. 
As he bends down to wipe it up with a napkin, Annie watches Robert clean the spill. Something about his movements, his posture -- a sense of weakness, of surrendering, of not having the inclination to fight, of just accepting and smoothing over the rough sports -- strikes her hard. Annie realizes the love she feels for Robert isn't fading. It's gone. 
He finishes cleaning and sits. 
ROBERT What was I saying? 
ANNIE About us going someplace warm... Someplace Grace'll have to wear shorts or bathing suits or summer dresses... 
Robert looks at her and realizes it's a bad idea. He nods, again, getting the message. Silence. In that silence, Annie looks at him... and makes a decision: 
ANNIE Robert, I want to take Pilgrim out to Mr. Booker. Drive him out to Montana... With Grace. 
Robert is confused... and a little worried. 
ROBERT I don't understand. You just said he said no. 
ANNIE He did, but... I think I can change his mind. 
ROBERT That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not. 
ANNIE Robert, Grace isn't adjusting to school. And she can't sit in this apartment all day... I think it would be good for her. 
ROBERT (at a loss) NO! What are you -- you're serious about this? 
ANNIE I've called Liz. They can set me up with a trailer for Pilgrim. I thought we'd stay at motels along the way... 
ROBERT (overlapping) You've already made arrangements!? 
ANNIE No. I was just researching. Calm down. 
ROBERT I come home and you tell me we're going to drive a psychotic horse to Montana! I can't just pick up and leave... 
ANNIE I'm not asking you to. I'll do it. 
ROBERT You want to do this by yourself? How? You can't take care of Pilgrim all the -- 
ANNIE He'll be sedated. I know horses, Robert. I'm the one who taught Grace how to ride. 
ROBERT (overlapping) What... Bo-... What about the magazine? 
ANNIE I'm in charge. I went back very soon after the accident. They didn't expect me for a couple of months. I'll just take that time now... I can still oversee things from Montana... Take my fax... My computer... 
Beat. Robert fears this is about the marriage. Yet -- 
ROBERT No. It's, uh... No, I really don't think it's a good idea 
ANNIE Why?! 
ROBERT (searching) Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability... 
ANNIE I can't say he's been all that effective with her. 
ROBERT Are you a psychiatrist? He said it takes time. 
ANNIE I don't care what he says! We have to do something, Robert! I can't sit here and trust everything's going to work out just by pretending it will. 
ROBERT I'm not pretending anything! 
Beat. Robert just stares at her. He looks concerned... almost worried. Annie gets uncomfortable. 
ANNIE What? 
It is very difficult for Robert to say; 
ROBERT I thought... well, ever since the accident, I just thought we... 
He stops. Annie knows where he headed and prays to God he doesn't continue. He doesn't. A thick silence hangs between them. 
ROBERT I really wish I could understand why you think this is so necessary. 
ANNIE (frustrated) Robert, we're losing her. We're losing her. (he listens) I don't care what the doctors say. The truth is, they don't know anymore than we do -- less, when it comes to Grace... This may not sound sensible or... logical, but nobody's suggesting anything better. I can't explain it, Robert. I just have this feeling... this annoying... bloody feeling that if... if, somehow, Pilgrim can be made all right... then so can Grace. I just know it! 
Robert can feel the strength of her will. He can find no way around it. 
ROBERT What if she doesn't want to go? 
ANNIE She will if you think she should. 
ROBERT And you think it's best if I don't come. 
ANNIE (hesitates) No, that's not what I said. I'm not a dictator. If you feel you should come, then come. Just do whatever you think is right. 
At some moment, they realize Grace is standing at the entrance to the kitchen. They are surprised. 
GRACE I'm not going! I don't care what she says! 
Annie lowers her head. Robert stares at Grace as she walks to him. 
GRACE Daddy?... I don't want to go. 
Grace stands next to Robert. He holds her hands. Annie looks at him, without sympathy. Robert looks back. In his face is the total acceptance of what must be. As well as the sadness of it's inevitability. He looks back at his daughter, whose eyes have never left him. 
EXT. JOAN DYER STABLE - DAY 
Pilgrim is being loaded into the trailer by four strong stable men, violently kicking and pulling all the way. 
Annie watches with anxiety -- an almost giddy Liz by her side. 
ANNIE Maybe we should give him another sedative.

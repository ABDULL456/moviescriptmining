MAJOR I bought that TV set so I could watch my programs, not so you and your friend could louse up my couch. 
DWAYNE You gotta learn how to share the common space. 
MAJOR The only thing common in this house is you. You remind me of your damn mother. Fat, dumb, and in my way. 
The Major grabs Dwayne and pulls him up off the couch. He gets right in his face...scary, intense. Dwayne turns to Jay. 
DWAYNE Let's get outta here. This movie sucks anyway. 
Jay gets up and files out the door. Dwayne goes to take the cold cut plate. The Major grabs his arm. 
MAJOR I paid for the damn cold cuts, too. Maybe if you had a job, or a fucking prospect, or a clue how to find any of the above, I'd let you eat 'em. 
DWAYNE (QUIETLY) You know, you can be a real sonofabitch, dad. 
MAJOR That's what it takes, boy. In the Corps, men like you wore dresses to keep us entertained. 
DWAYNE That's pretty fucking disturbing! 
Dwayne storms off. 
EXT. NICE HOUSE - DAY 
Dwayne and Jay head out, passing a brand new pickup truck in the driveway. Dwayne spits on it. 
DWAYNE Fuck The Major! 
The guys get in a shitty Ford Aerostar minivan and peel out. 
INT. DIVE STRIP CLUB - DAY 
R. Kelly's "Ignition (Remix)" pumps. 
Large, fake breasts, sparkling with cheap body glitter and pierced at the nipples, shake before us. Their owner, JUICY (27), a petite Latina, phones in a lap dance as Dwayne pours his heart out to her. 
Somewhere in the background, Jay hangs at the bar, all alone. 
DWAYNE - and he thinks he knows me. He don't know shit. I got ideas he could never dream of. I got plans bigger than his fucking house. (BEAT) He didn't even raise me. My mother did. That was a good woman. 
JUICY Oh yeah? What happened to her? 
Dwayne shifts, uncomfortably, at the sore subject. 
DWAYNE She passed on. 
JUICY I hope you're not one of those guys that comes here looking to get mothered. 
DWAYNE I wouldn't mind nursing on them titties, mamacita. 
JUICY Sure. Whatever you say. Maybe just keep quiet for a while, forget about your old man and let me do my thing. 
DWAYNE I wish I could forget about that asshole for good. I'm just waiting around for him to drop dead. Don't wanna mess with my inheritance. 
This piques Juicy's interest. 
JUICY What kinda inheritance? 
DWAYNE When my dad got outta the service, he started buying lotto tickets. He'd play his dog tag numbers. In '91, the fucker won five million bucks. INSERT PHOTO: The Major holding a giant cardboard check. DWAYNE He had some health problems a few years back, and since then he's been burning through the money like an NBA draft pick. Probably only got a million or two left. But it's mine as soon as he kicks. Behind inch-long fake eyelashes, Juicy's shrewd eyes narrow, mind working. She straddles Dwayne, tightly. JUICY You know, with a million bucks, you could have anything. Be like a king. (almost a moan) King Dwayne. DWAYNE That's right. And maybe I'll make you my queen. Let you polish my royal scepter. JUICY Practice makes perfect. Juicy pantomimes a long, slow chicken head. Dwayne is blissed out. She smiles at him, sticky sweet. JUICY Let me ask you a question...do you really hate your daddy? DWAYNE Hate him like the Steelers. JUICY Then maybe I can help you get that money now. Before he spends another penny. 
Dwayne looks confused. Juicy puts his hands on her breasts, emboldening him. 
JUICY I know a guy in Baltimore. He could help you out. Probably do it for... (sizing him up) ...100Gs. 
DWAYNE Do what? 
Juicy leans in, whispers softly in Dwayne's ear - 
JUICY Kill your mean old dad. 
On Dwayne's face as this new possibility pinballs around his mind, setting off a flood of different emotions. 
JUICY So, what do you think...you ready for your crown? 
INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT - MOVING 
Will has one pizza left in the back of his car. He pulls over outside an office building.

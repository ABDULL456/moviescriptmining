SEQUENCE "A" 
FADE IN: 
A-1 LOS ANGELES - A DOWNTOWN INTERSECTION 
It is night, about two o'clock, very light traffic. 
At the left and in the immediate foreground a semaphore traffic signal stands at GO. Approaching it at about thirty miles per hour is a Dodge 1938 coupe. It is driven erratically and weaving a little, but not out of control. 
When the car is about forty feet away, the signal changes to STOP. Car makes no attempt to stop but comes on through. 
A-2 A LIGHT NEWSPAPER TRUCK 
is crossing the intersection at right angles. It swerves and skids to avoid the Dodge, which goes on as though nothing had happened. The truck stops with a panicky screech of tires. There is a large sign on the truck: "READ THE LOS ANGELES TIMES". The truck driver's infuriated face stares after the coupe. 
A-3 THE COUPE 
continues along the street, still weaving, then slows down and pulls over towards the curb in front of a tall office building. 
A-4 THE COUPE 
stops. The headlights are turned off. For a second nothing happens, then the car door opens slowly. A man eases himself out onto the sidewalk and stands a moment leaning on the open door to support himself. He's a tall man, about thirty- five years old. From the way he moves there seems to be something wrong with his left shoulder. 
He straightens up and painfully lowers his left hand into his jacket pocket. He leans into the car. He brings out a light-weight overcoat and drapes it across his shoulders. He shuts the car door and walks toward the building. 
A-5 ENTRANCE OF THE BUILDING 
Above the closed, double-plate glass doors is lettered: "PACIFIC BUILDING". To the left of entrance there is a drugstore, closed, dark except for a faint light in the back. The man comes stiffly up to the doors. (CAMERA HAS MOVED UP WITH HIM). He tries the doors. They are locked. He knocks on the glass. Inside, over his shoulder, the lobby of the building is visible: a side entrance to the drugstore on the left, in the rear a barber shop and cigar and magazine stand closed up for the night, and to the right two elevators. One elevator is open and its dome light falls across the dark lobby. 
The man knocks again. The night watchman sticks his head out of the elevator and looks toward entrance. He comes out with a newspaper in one hand and a half-eaten sandwich in the other. He finishes the sandwich on the way to the doors, looks out and recognizes the man outside, unlocks the door and pulls it open. 
NIGHT WATCHMAN Hello there, Mr. Neff. 
Neff walks in past him without answering. 
A-6 INT. LOBBY 
Neff is walking towards elevator. Night watchman looks after him, relocks door, follows to elevator. Neff enters elevator. 
A-7 ELEVATOR 
Neff stands leaning against wall. He is pale and haggard with pain, but deadpans as night watchman joins him. 
NIGHT WATCHMAN Working pretty late aren't you, Mr. Neff? 
NEFF (Tight-lipped) Late enough. 
NIGHT WATCHMAN You look kind of all in at that. 
NEFF I'm fine. Let's ride. 
Night watchman pulls lever, doors close and elevator rises. 
NIGHT WATCHMAN How's the insurance business, Mr. Neff? 
NEFF Okay. 
NIGHT WATCHMAN They wouldn't ever sell me any. They say I've got something loose in my heart. I say it's rheumatism. 
NEFF (Scarcely listening) Uh-huh. 
Night watchman looks around at him, turns away again and the elevator stops. 
NIGHT WATCHMAN (Surly) Twelve. 
The door opens. Across a small dark reception room a pair of frosted glass doors are lettered: PACIFIC ALL-RISK INSURANCE COMPANY - FOUNDED 1906 - MAIN OFFICE. There is a little light beyond the glass doors. 
Neff straightens up and walks heavily out of the elevator, across reception room to doors. He pushes them open. The night watchman stares after him morosely, works lever, elevator doors start to close.

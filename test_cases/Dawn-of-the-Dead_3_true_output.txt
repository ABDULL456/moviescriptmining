Two of the Troopers retreat, revulsed. The sound of the gunfire and screaming can be heard from the hall. 
The big Black man walks calmly into the room. Roger watches him. He walks up to the writhing creatures one at a time, and fires carefully aimed shots into their heads with his hand gun. Tears roll down his cheeks. 
Some of the creatures are without arms and legs. Some have been eaten away about the neck and shoulder. They moan with a gurgling, gutteral sound as they try to move. 
A young Black Zombie, pulling itself along the floor with one arm, draws close to the Black Trooper. The big man aims his pistol. It clicks...empty. He quickly and efficiently reaches for more ammunition and begins to reload. The Zombie pulls closer, its mouth wide. 
Roger steps up behind the other Trooper and fires into the creatures head with his automatic rifle. 
The Black man brushes tears from his eyes and continues to load the pistol. 
Roger disposes of several other creatures. he comes to a place where several are piled together. Some lie still, others writhe about. Two on the heap, although they cannot move about, are eating at parts of other bodies. Roger shoots them. They never look up. They don't seem to notice him at all. 
A loud creaking sound breaks the mood suddenly. Roger looks up. 
65	 In the ceiling, a double set of loading doors has been opened. Several other Troopers look down into the storage area. 
Trooper:	JESUS CHRIST. 
He shines a light beam down towards Roger. 
Trooper:	YOU OK DOWN THERE? 
64	 Roger nods. 
65	 Trooper:	THIS MUST BE WHERE THEY DUMPED 'EM IN. 
64	 Roger looks down at the pile of corpses beneath the opening. 
65	 Trooper:	YOU NEED MORE MEN? 
64	 Roger shakes his head "no". 
65	 Trooper:	JESUS CHRIST. 
The trooper leaves the opening. He is replaced by two others who just stare down into the storage room through the weird, round lenses of their masks. 
66	 The distant sounds of the battle in the hall flare up again. The big Black man snaps his loaded clip into his pistol and takes a few steps forwards. He sees a corpse wrapped in a bed sheet and tied securely with clothes line. It looks like a mummy. It is writhing, trying to free itself. he shoots it through the head. 
Nearby, a small corpse, that of a very young child, is also writhing, but the end of the shroud, where the child's feet should be, has been torn open and is bloody. A stump kicks around the blood where a foot has been eaten off. The Black man fires into the thing's head. 
Roger:	THEY...ATTACK...EACH OTHER... 
Black:	JUST THE FRESH CORPSES...BEFORE THEY REVIVE... 
Roger:	WHY DID THESE PEOPLE KEEP THEM HERE? WHY DON'T THEY TURN THEM OVER...OR...OR DESTROY THEM THEMSELVES...IT'S INSANE...WHY DO THEY DO IT? 
Black:	'CAUSE THEY STILL BELIEVE THERE'S RESPECT IN DYING. 
The big man fires into the head of another squirming Zombie. 
67	 In the halls of the building, Troopers fall and are pounced on by ghouls. Other Troopers fire their automatics through the heads of attacking Zombies. The riot troops try to stay organised, but the onslaught is so mindless and random that it is turning into a riot. 
68A	The buildings of Philadelphia loom in the moonlight. What few lights remain lit reflect in the waters of the Delaware. 
68B	It is quiet except for the slight sounds of lapping water and an occasional wooden creak as the floating docks strain against one another. 
There are a few big Police launches still docked in the marina. They bob about silently. The chain, which normally restricted the area, is broken and dangling. The sign, which reads: CITY OF PHILADELPHIA - POLICE - NO ADMITTANCE clangs against the broken chain in the wind. 
Halfway down the long dock is a little guard house. Inside, sitting at a radio transmitter, is the corpse of a uniformed guard. 
Nearby is a separate floating dock on which is painted a large square pattern. It is a landing bay for Police helicopters. Alongside, afloat separately but securely chained fast, is a small fuel barge, with pumps and hoses for refueling the chopper and launches. 
The other bodies lie bleeding on the bobbing docks, another officer and a civilian. A bell buoy rings in the distance and we begin to hear the sound of an approaching helicopter. 
The blades of the J.A.S. Traffic Copter whine as they gear down for a landing. The whirlybird settles like a hummingbird on the gently bobbing heliport. 
69	 With the blades still spinning loudly, Stephen hops out of the cockpit. 
Steve:	COME ON...I NEED YOU. 
Francine unbuckles her safety belt and jumps out of her side of the machine. Steve runs, ducking under the blades, around to the woman's side of the cockpit, grabs her hand, and they make for the fuel pumps. 
Steve:	I DON'T SEE ROGER. WE'LL GIVE HIM TEN MINUTES. 
Fran:	OH MY GOD! 
70	 The woman freezes in mid stride, and her action brings Stephen's eyes around to see what she is staring at. The two bodies which lie near the fuel pumps. 
Steve:	YOU HAVEN'T BEEN OUT IN IT AT ALL. IT'S TOUGH TO GET USED TO IT.

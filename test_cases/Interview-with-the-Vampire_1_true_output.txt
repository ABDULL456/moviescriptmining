MALLOY You loved Yvette... 
LOUIS Can a vampire feel love? 
MALLOY You loved your wife, surely. 
LOUIS I was human then. Might as well ask can an angel feel love. Both are blesses or cursed with a certain... detachment. Though whether angels take as long to learn it as I, I will never know. 
He looks directly at Malloy, shocking him with his gaze. 
LOUIS Yes, I loved Yvette. As I loved Pointe Du Lac. And as with each thing I loved, I destroyed it. 
EXT. NEW ORLEANS - EVENING 
From the sea, at evening, shrouded in mist. 
LOUIS (V.O.) Lestat I did not love. And he survived. 
INT. INN - EVENING 
A lavish little supper chamber with coffered bed, fancy French furniture. Open to rooftops of colonial city. Louis sits by an open window looking out over the city. Behind, we can hear the laughter of Lestat and tow female voices. Louis turns and sees - 
Lestat, in the main chamber with two drugged or drunked whores. One runs her finger down his chest. The other seems out of it. 
WHORE #1 You're skin's icy. 
LESTAT Not always... 
He presses his thumb on her neck and holds her tight, sinking his teeth into her neck. After a time she falls to the bed, dead. he turns to the other. 
LESTAT Your friend has no head for wine. 
WHORE She's stupid. I can warm that cold skin of yours better than she can. 
LESTAT Do you think so? 
He rubs her breast. 
WHORE Why you're warm now. 
LESTAT Ah, but the price is pretty high. Your sweet friend - I exhausted her. 
He bites her in turn, drinks her blood. She does into the swoon. 
Louis looks on in disgust. He stands. 
LOUIS I'm leaving you. I can't stand this any longer. 
Lestat pulls away from the whore. 
LESTAT What, no flowery speeches? About what a monster I am? What a vulgar fiend? 
LOUIS I'm not interested in you. You disgust me. I'm interested in my own nature and know I can't trust you to tell me the truth about me. 
LESTAT What do you imagine you are Louis? 
LOUIS I don't pretend to know. 
LESTAT Don't you understand, Louis, that you alone of all creatures can see death with impunity... you alone under the rising moon can strike like the hand of God. 
The girl moans. 
LOUIS Lestat, she's alive!!! 
LESTAT Vampires are killers. Predators, who's all seeing eyes were meant to give them detachment. 
The girl moans again, open her eyes. 
LOUIS The girl, Lestat - 
LESTAT I know. Let her alone. 
He slashes her wrist with his teeth, and lets the blood drip into a glass. 
LESTAT You think you can be human. You think you can go back. But you can't. You live off the blood of rats now Louis. How human is that? 
The girls moans again. Lestat drinks that glass. 
LESTAT Lie still, love... 
The girl begins to scream. Lestat picks her up. 
LESTAT You're tired love, you want to sleep.

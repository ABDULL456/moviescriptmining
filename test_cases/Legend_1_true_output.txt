125 DELETED 
125A INTERIOR TUNNEL NIGHT 
The unicorn gallops through a desolate landscape of broken columns and grumbled masonry. 
126 EXTERIOR EDGE OF THE WORLD NIGHT 
A precipice jutting over eternity. The unicorn runs along a narrow trail bordering the edge of the abyss, highlighted by a bright backdrop of comets and stars. 
126A INTERIOR TUNNEL NIGHT 
CLOSE ON: The black hooves of Darkness as he runs relentlessly along the unicorn's track. 
PULL BACK to show Darkness TRANSFORMED into a muscular black unicorn stallion. He surges onward, an explosion of strength. FLAMES flare from his nostrils. 
126B EXTERIOR EDGE OF THE WORLD DAY 
The huge black unciron THUNDERS out of the cavern-mouth. 
The mare stand alone, trapped on a final promontory. 
The black stallion REARS and charges the mare.... 
Black and terrible, the devil stallion rises over the mare, striking out with his fearsome hooves. 
The mare staggers before this onslaught of evil, falling to the ground amid flying black feet. 
The black stallion paws the ground, preparing to ram his alicorn into the fallen mare. 
Jack runs out from the dark cavern, gripping the evil greatsword with both hands. He sees the stallion tower above the mare 
JACK (calling out): Darkness....! You rotten filth! 
The superb black unicorn turns to meet this new challenge. He SNORTS, breathing fire, and lowers his head, charging straight at Jack. 
Jack stands his ground, greatsword poised, as the huge black stallion gallops towards him, hooves striking SPARK. 
Jack swings with all his might as the demon unicorn ROARS slavering past. 
The greatsword passes straight through the black beast, as if it were striking a ghost. 
Jack is knocked off balance by the fury of the charge, but he manages to stay on his feet as the stallion wheels and attackes again. 
The black unicorn's red eyes BLAZE as he crashes into Jack. 
The Green Man is thrown awkwardly to one side. He loses the greatsword and sprawls helpless on the ground. 
Dazed, Jack rises on his elbows.. He sees the black hooves of Darkness standing before him. 
Looking up, Jack sees the Lord of Darkness TRANSFORMED back to his original form. He holds his alicorn sword pointed straight at the boy's heart. 
DARKNESS: Always a pleasure to take a brave man's life. 
Darkness thrusts down with the alicorn, but Jack rolls skillfully aside and counds to his feet. 
JACK: ....haven't killed me yet.... 
Jack draws his own sword and swings at Darkness, who parries with the alicorn. SPARKS fly. 
Jack swings again. Darkness catches the blade in his bare hand and holds Jack immobile to meet his malevolent gaze. 
DARKNESS: ....Oh, but I have... 
Jack is speechless with horror. 
DARKNESS (cont): Don't you know me, boy, don't you know from whence I come.... 
The muscle hump behind Darkness's neck bulges and cracks. It bursts open and a pair of leathery bat wings unfold. Jack's horror is complete. 
DARKNESS (cont): Time to die.... 
Darkness drives the alicorn sword into Jack's chest, running him through. 
Jack's eyes are wide with astonishment. Is this what it's like to die? 
Darkness pulls the alicorn out of Jack. There is no blood! No trace of a wound remains on his flesh. Jack blinks in wordless amazement. 
DARKNESS (cont): So...! I should have known....We're just the same! You're immortal, Jack! 
JACK (disbelieving): No....! I'm not! I'm human.... 
DARKNESS (laughing): Who was your mother? 
JACK (confused): I....don't know.... 
DARKNESS: Who was your father? 
JACK: ....I....can't remember.... 
DARKNESS: How long have you lived in the forest? 
JACK: All my life....! I...I.... know who I am.... 
DARKNESS: You pitiful fool! An immortal all this time and never knew.... (laughing) Don't you see, Jack? Don't you understand your power....! Together we could rule the universe! 
JACK (bewildered): .....together....? 
DARKNESS: There'd be nothing to stop us! No power could stand in our way! We're just the same, Jack....You and I..... eternal....! 
Jack struggles to understand the immensity of this revelation. He wavers in the face of the demon's persuasiveness. 
All at once, the mare unicorn gallops up from the shadows, white and pure.

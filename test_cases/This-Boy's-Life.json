{"test1_input": "THIS BOY'S LIFE Written by ROBERT GETCHELL \nBased on the book by TOBIAS WOLFF \nMarch 1992 Draft \nFOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY \nTHIS BOY'S LIFE FADE IN: \n1   EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY                                          1 It is 1957, and we are in the deserts of Utah. TONY BENNETT sings \"Rags to Riches\" on the SOUNDTRACK. Breath-taking scenery stretches out on either side of a highway. The CAMERA MOVES to reveal a Nash Ambassador as it labors up a hill. Twelve cars are caught behind the thirty-mile- per-hour pace. Two cars decide to ignore safety and cross the solid yellow line to pass the pokey car. \n2   INT. NASH AMBASSADOR - PARALLEL TIME                        2 Two people are in the straining car -- a woman and her son. The woman is CAROLINE WOLFF. Somewhere in her 30s, she is a pretty woman who can look beautiful if she works at it. (Just now, though, her prettiness is marred by a fading bruise on her right cheekbone.) She is bright and energetic and lively. Even more important than these qualities, though, is her humor. And most important of all is a sensual quality she exudes. Her sensuality is effortless -- as natural to her as the color of her eyes and hair. Men turn on the street to stare at her. The boy is TOBY WOLFF. A    pleasant-faced boy with won- derful eyes, he is 13 --   teetering on the brink of adolescence, so that one   moment he seems like a self- assured teenager, and the   very next like a ten-year-old kid. Just now the ten-year-old kid has the upper hand: bored and weary with the long trip, Toby has been arguing with Caroline, who is ignoring him. TOBY ... Well,  I mean it. I'm serious -- I do.   You promise and promise, and then  you change your mind, just like  that. CAROLINE (totally oblivious) ... Uh-huh. TOBY You wait 'til you ask me for something. Just wait. See if you get it. (CONTINUED) \n2   CONTINUED:                                              2 CAROLINE (as above) Toby, hush. Let me just... So concentrated on her driving she doesn't even finish her sentence, she nurses the car upward. Finally the car crests the hill and starts down. Caroline sighs with relief. She turns to Toby with a smile. CAROLINE What'd you say? TOBY I said -- for the twentieth time -- if a person promises somebody something, they can't just turn around and take it back. CAROLINE Oh, honey, Jesus. Don't start with that again. TOBY Why not? CAROLINE Because I'm the mother, and I get to tell you what to do every minute of your life 'til you're eighteen. Seriously, we've got no money. I can't buy you the moccasins. TOBY I bet if you'd promised Roy some moccasins he'd of got 'em. \nCAROLINE No talk about Roy, okay? And ditto the moccasins. We, can't, afford, them. TOBY Yeah, but you did promise... CAROLINE Sue me. Take me to court. Oh, Toby, I know you're disappointed, but... TOBY Jack.   Call me Jack.

BROKEN GUARD RAIL - DAY                                3 Other drivers have stopped to look: hundreds of feet below, the truck lies on its back among boulders. Caroline glances, then turns away. She pulls Toby away, one arm around his shoulder. \n4   EXT. NASH AMBASSADOR - MINUTES LATER                        4 Caroline fills the Nash's steaming radiator with a can of water. CAROLINE (not much heat) Goddamn thing. (CONTINUED) \n4   CONTINUED:                                          4 She glances back to where a larger crowd of people stare avidly down at the truck. She bites her lip. CAROLINE Oh, that poor man. There is a pause.   Then Toby speaks: TOBY I hope to hell this isn't some kind of omen. Caroline turns to Toby, her face worried. Then she sees the look in Toby's eyes -- he's ragging her. She grins and gives his shoulder a light, affectionate shove. \n5   INT. NASH AMBASSADOR - NIGHT                               5 Toby (feet up on the dashboard wearing a brand-new pair of Indian moccasins) and Caroline sing \"Mood Indigo\" together. Toby holds  a complicated-looking, black con- traption which looks something like an antique flashlight. TOBY How's this thing work, anyway? CAROLINE (not confident) It makes a black light that, uh, causes uranium traces to glow. TOBY And we just walk along the street and find this glowing uranium? \nCAROLINE Well, it was everywhere in Moab, they say -- just like gold in the gold-rush days. TOBY But we were too late in Moab, and that guy at the office said nobody'd found any uranium in Salt Lake City. CAROLINE Well, that means we'll have the place pretty much to ourselves, huh? Honey, this could be a big break for us. If this works out, oh, just think: we'll get us a house, get rid of this damn Nash Ambassador -- no money worries... It'll be like heaven on a June day. \n6   INT. CAR - DAWN                                           6 We hear \"MOOD INDIGO\" on the car RADIO and see that a weary Caroline has driven through the night and Toby is slumped against the passenger door. Toby stirs, then opens his eyes. CAROLINE Ask me how far we are from Salt Lake City. Toby is instantly awake, excited. Caroline points to a small highway sign and both she and Toby yell out. CAROLINE/TOBY Forty-seven miles to go! \nBoth of them are laughing with excitement. Toby claps his hands together once, very hard, and Caroline yells -- \n7   EXT. HIGHWAY - MORNING                                    7 Well, hell. The Nash Ambassador sits by the side of the road, its hood up, its radiator steaming. Caroline and Toby sit in a patch of shade by the car. CAROLINE If I could have one wish right now -- only one wish -- you know what I'd like? I'd like to burn this damn Nash Ambassador to a crisp. (as Toby laughs) I'm serious. I hate it. I hate the factory that produced it, and I hate the man who invented it. \n", "test1_id": 84, "test2_input": "56   INT. DWIGHT'S LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON                        56 Toby and Pearl are playing a card game called \"Slap- Jack.\" Toby slaps a card down hard, yelling \"I win again!\" and Pearl pouts. \nPEARL That's no fair. You make me sick. I don't know why you have to live here, anyway. Daddy says we should think of it like you were a charity kid. Toby takes out his comb, combs his hair a bit, then holds it out to Pearl, an exaggerated look of innocence on his face. TOBY Wanna comb your hair, Pearl? Pearl covers her bald spot with one hand. TOBY Probably you do, since you've got such pretty hair.  I know if I had hair as pretty as yours, Pearl, I'd comb it all the time. \nPearl is on the verge of tears. There are THREE TREMEN- DOUSLY LOUD FLAT-FOOTED KICKS against the front door. DWIGHT (O.S.) Open the hell up! I got us a treat! Pearl opens the door revealing a beaming Dwight holding two dishpans piled high with snow. We see through the doorway that the sun is shining and there isn't snow anywhere. PEARL We're gonna have snowcream! \n57   INT. DWIGHT'S KITCHEN - LATER                                 57 Dwight, Toby, Skipper, Norma, and Pearl are enjoying the snowcream. DWIGHT ... heard there was a fresh snow this morning, so I drove up to the mountains. I stopped in a field where it was all clean. I was finished packing it up high when somebody said... (prissy voice) This's private property, in case you're interested. (normal voice) I turned around and there was this woman... (he shudders) Yechh! Ugliest woman I ever saw -- ugly as a madman's ass she was. And frowning on top of it. Everybody laughs. NORMA Oh, Daddy! DWIGHT She was! TOBY (to Pearl; soft; happy) You're ugly as a madman's ass. PEARL No, you are. \nSKIPPER What'd you say to the ugly woman? DWIGHT I didn't say nothin' -- I ran. Everybody laughs again.    They eat in silence for a beat. DWIGHT I'm gonna get you a Scout uniform, Jack. TOBY (surprised, pleased) Really? (CONTINUED) \n57   CONTINUED:                                               57 PEARL Can I join the Girl Scouts? DWIGHT I'm getting one for me, too. Don't believe in doing anything halfway. If you're serious about the Scouts... (as Toby nods) ... then I want you to do it right. We'll do it right together. Dwight takes out a magazine entitled Boy's Life.    He hands it to Toby. \nDWIGHT I got you a subscription to this. I'll take the price out of your paper route money. TOBY Boy's Life? DWIGHT It's the official Scout magazine. Tells about what it means to be a Scout, what kind of boy you need to be, and, oh, about merit badges and stuff like that. Toby opens the book at random, reads from it. TOBY 'Suggested good turns a Scout can do: assist a foreign  boy with some English grammar.  Help put out a burning field.  Give water to a crippled dog.'  I could do those. DWIGHT Hell, yes, you could. You're a bright kid. I want this Scout thing done right, okay? Toby nods, enthusiastic, happy. \n58   INT. TOBY AND SKIPPER'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON              58 Toby stands in front of a full-length mirror wearing a huge Scout uniform that's been unsuccessfully cut down for him. (CONTINUED) \n58   CONTINUED:                                             58 The shirt-sleeves have been shortened but the shoulders extend two inches beyond the ends of his shoulders. The pants legs have been cut off and hemmed but the crotch of the trousers hangs down three inches too low, giving him a stumpy, dwarfish look. Toby yells to someone O.S. TOBY I'm not going. DWIGHT (O.S.) The hell you say. TOBY I'm not. Cut down Skipper's old stuff, and he's twice as big as me -- I'm gonna stay home. DWIGHT (O.S.) You're gonna shit and fall back in it -- that's all you're gonna do. Now get out here. \n", "test2_true": "TOBY I look like an idiot. DWIGHT You act like an idiot, you look fine. TOBY You said you'd get me a new uniform. DWIGHT I said I'd try to get you a new uniform. Beside, this one is new -- new to you. (CONTINUED) \n59   CONTINUED:                                           59 TOBY But look at the sleeves and how it hangs down between my legs! DWIGHT Oh piss and moan -- all you can do is piss and moan. TOBY Yeah, piss and moan -- I notice you're all jazzed up in new stuff. DWIGHT They didn't have second-hand uniforms in my size. \nTOBY Oh, yeah, pull the other leg, it's got bells on it! Toby throws himself down on the sofa. DWIGHT And what're you gonna tell Caroline this weekend? You gonna say you wouldn't join the Scouts because... him didn't wike his widdle uniform? Dwight picks up the copy of Boy's Life and thumbs through it, He reads: DWIGHT 'No boy given over to dissipation or negativity can stand the gaff. He quickly tires and gives up. He is the type who usually lacks courage at the crucial moment. He cannot take punishment and come back smiling.' Dwight looks at Toby expectantly.   Toby hesitates, then gives up. TOBY All right, but this stinks. Toby walks outside.   Dwight follows. DWIGHT Hotshot, you don't know it yet, but me and Concrete are in your blood. We're going to make a man of you yet -- and in years to come you'll thank me. You'll remember me. Me and Concrete. \n60   EXT. CAROLINE'S HOUSE - DAY                                   60 Dwight's Buick pulls up and Caroline bursts out the front door. She runs to the car and hugs Toby. CAROLINE Oh, I missed you! TOBY Me, too. CAROLINE You look good.     How are you? TOBY I'm okay.    I'm fine. \nDwight comes around the car, kisses Caroline, and the three head into the house. CAROLINE I said to hell with the budget and bought a roast. I made dumplings -- God, what's wrong with your hands? TOBY It's just juice from some chestnuts -- it'll wear off. CAROLINE I hope so.   My, your hair's short. \n61   INT. CAROLINE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY                             61 Dwight, Caroline and Marian are having a drink. Toby plays FATS DOMINO'S \"Blue Monday\" on the RADIO, the VOLUME LOW. \nMARIAN (to Dwight) Well, it's done him a world of good to be up there with you. DWIGHT Oh, we have us some pretty good times. Don't we, Jack? Have us some good times? Toby, not looking away from the radio, nods. DWIGHT We go to the Scouts together every week. He's got a good start already on merit badges... (MORE) (CONTINUED) \n61   CONTINUED:                                              61 DWIGHT (CONT'D) (to Toby) ... though he does concentrate too much on the easy ones, like the one for dental hygiene... (to Caroline) ... and we had snowcream one night, and, oh, just lots of stuff. Caroline glances at Toby, then at Dwight, then back again. \n", "test2_id": 85, "test3_input": "67   INT. DWIGHT'S LIVING ROOM - PARALLEL TIME                   67 Caroline is trying to stifle her laughter, as she stares at the wilderness of white. Dwight and Toby, Skipper, Norma, and Pearl all stand watch. (CONTINUED) \n67   CONTINUED:                                                67 CAROLINE Oh! Oh, I'm so sorry... don't know what's the matter with me... you're right... it does look clean... But she can't stop laughing.    Her laughter has just a tinge of hysteria. \n68   INT. SMALL CHURCH - MORNING                                     68 Dwight and Caroline are being married. Caroline wears a pale blue suit, and Dwight looks good in a navy single- breasted. Aside from Toby and Dwight's children, the only guests are Marian, Kathy, and three people we haven't seen before -- friends of Dwight's. \n69   INT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT                 69 The bed is a rat's nest of twisted sheets as Dwight   and Caroline make love. He takes his lips away from Caroline's breast and moves so that his head is at   the bottom of the bed. Holding her foot up, he kisses    the instep, then runs his tongue over the same spot and   then down under the arch of her foot. A sexy scene. DWIGHT M-m-m. There's not a straight line on you -- everything's curved. Caroline draws him up   to her, and they kiss. Then Dwight turns Caroline   on her side, away from him, pre- paring to enter her.    Caroline makes a small sound of protest, turning back   toward him. CAROLINE Oh, Dwight, not like that.    Not this time -- not tonight. DWIGHT It's good this way. CAROLINE But I want to see your face while we make love. DWIGHT (uncomfortable laugh) Oh, no -- I just don't... uh... like that way. (CONTINUED) \n69   CONTINUED:                                             69 Dwight continues to stroke Caroline, his hands everywhere, but now she is unresponsive. CAROLINE You mean you don't like to make love face to face? DWIGHT (same laugh) No, I don't like it. I can't handle it -- I don't like to see the face. CAROLINE You mean ever? \nDwight murmurs an assent.    Caroline is appalled. CAROLINE But that's grotesque... DWIGHT (stung; flares up) Look, you can get it doggie-style or you can get it laying on your side -- those are your only choices. This is my house, and I get to say. Wherever McGinty sits is the head of the table, you know? Disgusted, Caroline turns back away from Dwight. He shifts down on the bed a few inches, again preparing to enter her. \n70   INT. KITCHEN - NEXT MORNING                                  70 Toby is eating toast at the kitchen table. Norma has made a big breakfast, and she hurriedly pours the coffee when she hears Dwight and Caroline's bedroom DOOR OPEN. NORMA Happy Wedding Breakfast! Caroline's eyes    are red and swollen. Dwight turns ON a RADIO, sips his    coffee, and chats with Norma. Toby gives Norma's rear-end    an appreciative glance, then comes up behind Caroline,    speaking sotto voce: TOBY So how's the bride? (CONTINUED) \n70   CONTINUED:                                              70 CAROLINE Don't. TOBY The bride doesn't want to chat? CAROLINE Stop it. TOBY Well, the bride is sure snotty this morning. Smiling, Toby waits for some response to his teasing, but there is none. She turns away and sits at the table. \n71   EXT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - AFTERNOON                     71 Toby, his news bag slung over his shoulder, stands talking idly with two boys from school, OSCAR BOOKER and JIMMY VOORHEES. One of them says, \"Uh-oh,\" and jerks his head to indicate where Toby and the other boy should look. They look in the direction indicated, and see Arthur Gayle coming down the road toward them, followed by a small black dog called Pepper. As the boys watch Arthur's approach: TOBY What's his name again? OSCAR Arthur Gayle. \n", "test3_true": "71   CONTINUED:                                          71 OSCAR (to Toby) Call him a sissy. TOBY Why? OSCAR Just see what he says. JIMMY Yeah, do it. By this time Arthur is next to them. Smiling a superior smile, he stops and glances at all three of them as if they were just the oddest things he's ever seen. Then his eye falls on Toby's yellow hands. ARTHUR Oh, my, my -- look at all that yellow: Didn't your mama teach you to wash your hands after you pee? TOBY Oh, shut up. ARTHUR (rolls his eyes; heavily sarcastic) Now that's what I like -- an insult with some originality. Did you just make that up? Just now? So clever. TOBY Why don't you take a long walk off a short pier? ARTHUR (though he's not nearly close enough to smell Toby's breath) Excuse me, but has anyone ever told you your breath would gag a maggot? Both of Toby's friends laugh. TOBY Well, at least I'm not a great big sissy! Two things happen instantly: the superior smile vanishes from Arthur's face, and Toby's friends exchange a single expectant look: \"Here it comes.\" (CONTINUED) \n71   CONTINUED:   (2)                                             71 Without warning, Arthur swings a fist at Toby, catching him on the ear. Arthur's second blow hits him in the back of the head. The fight is on. Arthur throws   punches sidearm, with lots of wrist action, but there are   so many of them. Before Toby can react, Arthur has hit   him four times, including one wild haymaker that puts Toby   on his knees. While Toby's still on his knees, Arthur tries to kick him in the stomach. The kick is deadened by the papers in Toby's bag, Arthur bends over Toby, screaming as if he has lost his mind: \nARTHUR GET UP! GET UP, YOU SON OF A BITCHING MAGGOT GAGGER! I'LL STOMP YOUR GUTS OUT! I'LL KILL YOU! Toby gets up, and again Arthur sails in with those wild roundhouse swings. Then Toby gets in a solid punch to Arthur's face that rocks the bigger boy back on his heels. Arthur grabs his head and roars like a wounded buffalo. Almost immediately Arthur's eye puffs and begins to swell shut. Snot streaming from both nostrils, still roaring, Arthur flies at Toby again. Toby closes with him, to hold those flailing arms still, and the two stagger around the street like drunken dancers. They separate, exchange a few blows, then grapple with each other again. Then Arthur hooks Toby's leg, trips him, and the two roll off the shoulder of the road and down an embankment. They hit the muddy bottom of the gully still hitting, flailing, kicking -- first Toby is on top, then Arthur, then Toby, then Arthur. By now they are panting, each breath is a heave, a gasp. Then, suddenly, Arthur gives out completely -- he falls on top of Toby, pressing him deeper into the mud. With his last bit of strength Toby throws the bigger boy off him and sits up, while PEPPER BARKS FURIOUSLY at him and threatens to nip his leg. Toby staggers to his feet and starts to climb the gully. He looks relieved -- at least it's over. No, it's not. From behind him he hears three words. ARTHUR Take it back. (CONTINUED) \n71   CONTINUED:   (3)                                                71 Toby turns   to see a bloody-faced, swollen-eyed Arthur clambering   up the hill after him, like some monster that won't   die. Both boys reach the top and stand facing one   another. ARTHUR Take it back. Arthur's words are not angry anymore.    Toby's worn out too... TOBY Okay. ARTHUR Say it. TOBY Okay.   I take it back. ARTHUR No, say 'You're not a sissy.' Toby glances at Oscar and Jimmy. Their faces are gleeful but he doesn't care what the hell they think. TOBY You're not a sissy. Arthur immediately turns and walks away, but Toby ignores them and walks away in the opposite direction, delivering his hated newspapers. \n72   INT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S LIVING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON         72 \nCaroline is painting the white walls a soothing buff color.  On the sofa lie half-finished curtains she's making.  She is totally focused. She hears Toby, turns, sees his filthy clothes. Her shoulders sag. CAROLINE I won't do it, you know. I won't be a referee between the two of you. TOBY Who asked you? CAROLINE You both do. You do. Just by coming home like this you ask me to take your side when he raises hell. (MORE) (CONTINUED) \n72   CONTINUED:                                             72 CAROLINE (CONT'D) Well, the answer's 'No.' I'm going to make this marriage work. No fights. TOBY Oh, the bride is calm.   Who the hell cares? Caroline refuses to argue. She picks up a piece of material and holds it up to the window to see if her choice of color was a good one. CAROLINE (to herself) ... seems like this place is so ugly. Seems like everywhere I look there's something... ugly. \n73   INT. SKIPPER AND TOBY'S ROOM - EVENING                       73 A worried Toby sits dreading Dwight's arrival. Behind him, on the wall, Toby has pinned the covers of fifteen copies of the Scout magazine: so that, above Toby's head are the words BOY'S LIFE fifteen times. There is a MURMUR of VOICES, and FOOTSTEPS COMING toward Toby. Toby expects the worst. But, surprisingly, Dwight is beaming. DWIGHT Who won? TOBY (surprised) Uh, well, uh... he's the one can't see out of one eye. DWIGHT Hot damn! You actually gave little Lord Gayle a black eye? TOBY Well, it wasn't black yet. DWIGHT But it was all puffed up? (as Toby nods) Then it was a shiner. (CONTINUED) \n", "test3_id": 86}

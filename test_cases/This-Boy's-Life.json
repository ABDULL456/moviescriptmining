{"train": "THIS BOY'S LIFE Written by ROBERT GETCHELL \nBased on the book by TOBIAS WOLFF \nMarch 1992 Draft \nFOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY \nTHIS BOY'S LIFE FADE IN: \n1   EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY                                          1 It is 1957, and we are in the deserts of Utah. TONY BENNETT sings \"Rags to Riches\" on the SOUNDTRACK. Breath-taking scenery stretches out on either side of a highway. The CAMERA MOVES to reveal a Nash Ambassador as it labors up a hill. Twelve cars are caught behind the thirty-mile- per-hour pace. Two cars decide to ignore safety and cross the solid yellow line to pass the pokey car. \n2   INT. NASH AMBASSADOR - PARALLEL TIME                        2 Two people are in the straining car -- a woman and her son. The woman is CAROLINE WOLFF. Somewhere in her 30s, she is a pretty woman who can look beautiful if she works at it. (Just now, though, her prettiness is marred by a fading bruise on her right cheekbone.) She is bright and energetic and lively. Even more important than these qualities, though, is her humor. And most important of all is a sensual quality she exudes. Her sensuality is effortless -- as natural to her as the color of her eyes and hair. Men turn on the street to stare at her. The boy is TOBY WOLFF. A    pleasant-faced boy with won- derful eyes, he is 13 --   teetering on the brink of adolescence, so that one   moment he seems like a self- assured teenager, and the   very next like a ten-year-old kid. Just now the ten-year-old kid has the upper hand: bored and weary with the long trip, Toby has been arguing with Caroline, who is ignoring him. TOBY ... Well,  I mean it. I'm serious -- I do.   You promise and promise, and then  you change your mind, just like  that. CAROLINE (totally oblivious) ... Uh-huh. TOBY You wait 'til you ask me for something. Just wait. See if you get it. (CONTINUED) \n2   CONTINUED:                                              2 CAROLINE (as above) Toby, hush. Let me just... So concentrated on her driving she doesn't even finish her sentence, she nurses the car upward. Finally the car crests the hill and starts down. Caroline sighs with relief. She turns to Toby with a smile. CAROLINE What'd you say? TOBY I said -- for the twentieth time -- if a person promises somebody something, they can't just turn around and take it back. CAROLINE Oh, honey, Jesus. Don't start with that again. TOBY Why not? CAROLINE Because I'm the mother, and I get to tell you what to do every minute of your life 'til you're eighteen. Seriously, we've got no money. I can't buy you the moccasins. TOBY I bet if you'd promised Roy some moccasins he'd of got 'em. \nCAROLINE No talk about Roy, okay? And ditto the moccasins. We, can't, afford, them. TOBY Yeah, but you did promise... CAROLINE Sue me. Take me to court. Oh, Toby, I know you're disappointed, but... TOBY Jack.   Call me Jack. (CONTINUED) \nTOBY It almost makes me want to see Roy -- he was the only one could make the thing stop overheating. (a beat) My God, he was boring. Boring and mean: you sure got crappy taste in boyfriends. At the mention of Roy's name, Caroline lightly touches the bruise on her right cheekbone. Not enjoying the talk about Roy, she pours the water into the radiator, and speaks directly to the car. CAROLINE I'd like to burn you to the ground. (to Toby; big smile) Let's go get rich in Salt Lake City! \n8    EXT. SALT LAKE CITY (DOWNTOWN) - DAY                       8 Toby waits beside the Nash Ambassador, looking toward a three-story concrete building. He holds a portable RADIO, which PLAYS DEAN MARTIN singing \"Volare.\" \n9    INT. BUILDING - PARALLEL TIME                              9 Caroline, holding the imitation Geiger counter, stands across the counter from a MAN who is looking at her very strangely. MAN You're pulling my leg, right? CAROLINE No, I came here to look for uranium. MAN My God, lady. If you're looking for uranium, why didn't you go to Moab? CAROLINE We went there, but everybody'd beaten us there. We were too late. MAN So you came here just on the chance you'd find uranium? Listen, you mind me saying something to you might sound rude? Lady, you got more courage than you got common sense. \n10   EXT. NASH AMBASSADOR - DAY                                 10 Caroline exits the building, dumps the Geiger counter in a trash can and strides to the car. She gets in, and says two words: CAROLINE Don't ask. \n11   INT. NASH AMBASSADOR - DAY                                 11 Caroline turns the key in the ignition and gets only a maddening RER-RER-RER-RER noise from the ENGINE: wearily, she rests her forehead on the steering wheel. \n12   EXT. NASH AMBASSADOR - TWENTY MINUTES LATER             12 Caroline and Toby have the hood up and are peering into the engine. TOBY That mechanic in Colorado said it needed points. CAROLINE I know. Don't tell me what I already know. This thing's a bottomless pit. I don't know what to do. No matter how much money I pour into it... Suddenly a WOMAN in pedal-pushers and a thin, inexpensive sweater stops. She's vaguely low-class, but friendly and sympathetic. WOMAN I'd rather be whipped with a belt than have car trouble. 'Course these days I don't have to worry about that. My husband got laid off at the mill, and they repossessed the car, so wherever I wanna go, I just have to hoof it, you know? Caroline smiles, then her face changes. CAROLINE You don't have    a car? (as the    Woman shakes    her head) You want this    one? \nShocked, the Woman says -- WOMAN I... uh... I... TOBY You're gonna give our car away? CAROLINE (to the Woman) Seriously. It needs points, and it overheats constantly, but you can have it if you want it, because my hand to God, I can't look at it one more minute. WOMAN Well, sure... (CONTINUED) \n12   CONTINUED:                                              12 CAROLINE Get the bags out. Get the owner's slip out of the glove compartment. We're rid of this son-of-a-bitch pink and white albatross. You don't mind taking a car with a big dent in the passenger door? WOMAN Hell, no. (she looks) There's no dent there... Caroline draws back her leg and delivers a terrific, flat-footed kick to the door, leaving a dent the size of a dish-pan. CAROLINE Oh, yes there is! Toby hands the Woman the owner's slip, Caroline gives her the keys. WOMAN ... you really just giving me this car? CAROLINE It's done. It's yours. You got yourself a Nash Ambassador! (to Toby) Let's go! Both of them pick up two bags apiece -- all they have in the world -- and off they go, feeling good. \n13   EXT. CITY STREET - DAY (FEW MINUTES LATER)                   13 1957 is all around us: gas is 29.9 cents a gallon; bread is 19 cents a loaf; cars are curved and heavily chromed; people occasionally nod and smile at strangers; children carry hula hoops. In all, a gentler time. Caroline and Toby stride along briskly, as if they knew where they were going. CAROLINE ... find ourselves a cheap room someplace, we'll get you into school, I'll brush up on my typing and get a job, and things'll start looking up. I feel it: the good times are coming. And at least we're rid of that damn Nash Ambassador! (CONTINUED) \n17    INT. CAROLINE AND TOBY'S KITCHEN - ONE HOUR LATER           17 Caroline, Toby and ROY are eating at the tiny table. Roy is good-looking in a meaty, hairy-chested sort of way. Though he is on his very best behavior just now, there is a mean streak in him. Toby, delighted, holds a Winchester .22 rifle across his lap -- a peace-making gift from Roy. (CONTINUED) \n17   CONTINUED:                                               17 ROY ... I found me a room, but it's clear the hell and gone 'cross town. And I think I got a job lined up doin' tune-ups in a Texaco station. How you like it at Winstead's? CAROLINE How do you know where I work? ROY I been here almost a week. CAROLINE You followed me around?    For a week? Watching? Roy doesn't answer.   He just wiggles his eyebrows like Groucho Marx. CAROLINE And how did you ever find me? Again, Roy does the Groucho Marx.    He turns to Toby. ROY You like the rifle, Toby?    'Jack,' I mean. TOBY It's the best present I ever got. I just love it. (to Caroline) I'm going to pretend I'm shooting. \nCAROLINE Don't point that thing at anybody or I won't teach you to shoot. TOBY It's not loaded! CAROLINE You heard me:    anybody or any thing. TOBY It's got no bullets, for God's sake. CAROLINE Don't make me speak to you again. (CONTINUED) \n17   CONTINUED:   (2)                                             17 TOBY I'll point it at the sky, then. Caroline sighs. Toby opens a screenless window and points the gun up into the night sky, pretending to fire it over and over. Caroline starts to clear the table. Roy jumps up to help her. \n18   INT. LIVING ROOM - TWO HOURS LATER                           18 Caroline and Roy are   kissing on the sofa, and he is all over her: his hands    are on her breasts, her thighs, everywhere. Aroused    in spite of herself, Caroline pulls away, indicating the   light in the other room. \nCAROLINE Don't.   Toby's still up. Roy leans back, smiling, and eyes Caroline. ROY You are one sweet thing, baby: just the sight of you makes my dick hard. He pulls her to him, starting to kiss her. She fends him off, looking worriedly toward the room where Toby's light burns. ROY Aw, he won't hear anything. Again he pulls her toward him; again she turns her head from the kiss. \nThen it happens. A spasm of anger passes across his face and he shoves Caroline away from him. It's a hard shove, but nothing that could really hurt her. Violence has happened before between these two, and they recognize it. Caroline is immediately on guard, and Roy is apologetic. ROY Shit, baby, I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. I'm just so glad to see you. He slides toward Caroline, kisses her. This time she accepts the kiss -- feels she has no choice. \n19   INT. KITCHEN - PARALLEL TIME                                  19 Dressed for bed, Toby stands by an open window. He can hear every WORD of ROY'S, who continues to apologize between kisses. The room is illuminated by a nearby streetlamp. The frosty air from the open window causes his breath to steam. He raises two fingers to his lips, pretends to take a drag on a cigarette and blows out the steam from his breath. The VOICES in the other room grow a bit LOUDER, almost to an argument, and then SUBSIDE again. Toby takes another drag from his pretend cig- arette. He looks very young. \n20   EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - AFTERNOON                           20 Toby wanders toward the rooming house. He stops to watch TWO fiftyish WOMEN who are working in a garden. One Woman looks up. WOMAN #1 Hi. TOBY Hello. The Woman stops to take a breather, lights a cigarette, pokes her companion. WOMAN #1 My Lord, look at the eyes on him -- won't he be a heartbreaker in three, four years? WOMAN #2 Bedroom eyes. Toby smiles. \n31   EXT. ROAD - MORNING                                        31 We see Dwight driving his shiny Buick, Caroline and Toby beside him. As the CAMERA TRACKS the car with VARIOUS SHOTS, we hear: DWIGHT (V.O.) ... air like wine at my place, and I don't mind saying I wouldn't live anywhere else, and that's the God's honest truth. There's good schools, honest people, and some of the best fishing in the world. Ted Williams -- you like baseball, Toby? That is, Jack, I mean -- you like baseball? 'Cause Ted Williams, whom I believe is one of the all-time greats, is also a world-class angler. Many's the day he and I've talked over the best way to get a fish to say yes to a hook. (MORE) (CONTINUED) \n31    CONTINUED:                                                   31 DWIGHT (V.O.) (CONT'D) (a beat) Hunting, too: there's game everywhere you look. I don't think I flatter myself by saying that I'm something of a whiz with a rifle, and Concrete gives me every opportunity to prove it... \n32    EXT. SMALL BRIDGE - DAY                                      32 The three stand by the edge of the bridge, looking down into the water. \nThey see salmon fighting the last few yards of their yearly battle to spawn. Against the rapid current, they leap again and again. Long strips of flesh hang from their bodies. DWIGHT They always show you salmon fighting to get upstream, but they never show you what they look like when they get there. Her face strained, Caroline leans over for a closer look. The salmon swim in slow, stunned circles, some with an eye missing or hanging by a membrane, a hideous sight. CAROLINE It's pitiful.     Awful. DWIGHT They'll spawn, and then they'll die. They're dying now. \nAs Toby and Caroline move to the passenger side of the car, Toby speaks so Dwight can't hear: TOBY I hope to hell it's not an omen. Caroline has to fight back a smile. \nA33   EXT. CONCRETE SILO - DAY                               A33 The Buick drives into town past an enormous disused Concrete silo where \"Welcome To Concrete\" is painted in huge faded letters. (CONTINUED) \n26A. A33   CONTINUED:                                                  A33 DWIGHT So here we go. Welcome to Concrete. Dwight's home sweet home. Finest people in the whole state of Washington, you ask me. Lots of churches, too. A neighbor of mine says, \"Looking for nice churches, come to Concrete. Looking for sin, go to hell.\" I think that's funny... Caroline and Toby are severely underimpressed with their first impression of Concrete. \n33    EXT. DWIGHT'S HOUSE - DAY                                   33 Dwight's Buick pulls to a stop; Dwight, Caroline, and Toby get out. The scenery is as beautiful as Dwight said it was. DWIGHT All the houses are converted Army barracks, made into duplexes -- Three children exit the    house. SKIPPER, a pleasant boy who is average in every    way, is 17. NORMA is 18, slow- spoken and sensual, Toby    cannot take his eyes off her. The third is PEARL, two    years younger than Toby. Pearl has a bald spot the size    of a dollar, high on the side of her head. DWIGHT Well. Let's see here. Kids, this is my pretty friend, Caroline Wolff, and her boy To... (MORE) (CONTINUED) \n33   CONTINUED:                                              33 DWIGHT (CONT'D) (he catches himself) Jack Wolff. These are my kids: Skipper, Norma and my baby, Pearl. Everybody says hello, shakes hands, then they all head into the house. \n36   INT. DWIGHT'S LIVING ROOM - HOUR LATER                        36 Dwight has recovered his good mood. Dressed in a marksman's coat with a padded shoulder, Dwight is laughing as he attempts to assemble Toby's Winchester .22. (CONTINUED) \n36   CONTINUED:                                              36 DWIGHT 'Turkey shoot' is just a figure of speech. TOBY There's no real turkey? DWIGHT No, it's just regulation paper targets. It's a test of skill. (a beat) And, Jack, I just found out yesterday that they won't let kids shoot. \nTOBY But you said I could! DWIGHT I know, but they got it all screwed up somehow and told me wrong at first. Toby starts to argue, but Caroline touches his arm. CAROLINE Dwight, you did tell him. DWIGHT (an edge) I don't make the rules, Caroline. If I made the rules, I might make different ones, but I don't make the rules. \n37   EXT. OPEN FIELD - DAY                                         37 A sullen Toby stands with Pearl. Dwight is giving his name and the entry fee to a MAN. As the Man moves away, Caroline stops him and holds out some money. CAROLINE Wolff.   Caroline Wolff. MAN You mean you want to enter? I think it's against the rules. (CONTINUED) \n37   CONTINUED:                                             37 CAROLINE Well, that sign says this is an N.R.A. club, and I'm a dues-paying N.R.A. member. That gives me the right to participate in the activities of other chapters. MAN You'll be the only woman shooting. Caroline just smiles. The Man shrugs, takes her money and writes down her name. \n38   EXT. SHOOTING RANGE - DAY                                    38 \nThe shooting match has begun. The contestants have ten turns to fire ten shots apiece at a large paper bull's-eye fifty yards away. The scores and rankings are on a portable scoreboard. A contestant finishes SHOOTING. There is a pause. Everyone watches as his score is raised from behind the concrete wall on which the bull's-eye hangs. The score comes:     84. There is a smattering of applause, and it's Dwight's turn. From his stance, Dwight looks as if he is a pretty good shot. He's nervous, though, because Caroline is going to shoot, and he squeezes off his TEN SHOTS in RAPID SUCCESSION, hardly pausing to breathe. A pause, and then his score is raised: 73. Dwight smiles an inappropriate smile and hands the Winchester to Caroline. \nThere are a couple of whistles as Caroline takes her position, and someone in the crowd yells out, \"Oh, Mama, shake that thang!\" Caroline ignores it, taking her shooting stance, which is surprisingly graceful and professional-looking. She SHOOTS her TEN BULLETS, taking time to breathe once, deeply, between each shot. The pause, and her score is raised: 93. There is a moment of surprised silence, and then the crowd gives Caroline a sincere round of applause. \nSAME SCENE - LATER Dwight looks stunned, and Toby is almost equally surprised. (CONTINUED) \nToby nods. Silver     and Taylor howl with laughter. Furious, Toby says    \"Fuck you\" over and over. He pulls out a rat-tail and    scratches the words \"FUCK YOU\" onto the soft paint of    the bathroom wall. \n43   EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - AFTERNOON                           43 Toby stands at the top of a small hill with Terry Silver and Terry Taylor. They are too casual, their faces too innocent: something's up. They wait until a middle-aged man raking leaves turns and disappears around a corner. Then the three of them open the door of a car, take off the emergency brake, and start it rolling down the hill. (CONTINUED) \n43   CONTINUED:                                             43 The car rolls silently down the hill. It CRASHES into another car at the bottom, making a LOUD NOISE. The three boys run like the wind out of sight. \n44   INT. CAROLINE AND TOBY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT                     44 Caroline, Toby, Marian and Kathy sit at the table eating dinner. KATHY ... exactly what I wanted for my dress. It's a Simplicity pattern, and I'm pretty sure I can make it myself. It's got big puff sleeves... Caroline takes out a cigarette. Then everybody jumps as Toby yells and jumps up knocking his chair over backwards. TOBY Oh! Toby grabs Caroline's lighter, and begins to imitate Dwight: saying, \"Oh!\" and \"Oh, yes!\" and Oh, my!\" and \"Here, let me!\" and \"I'll do that!\" It's a mean, accurate imitation of Dwight. All three women laugh in spite of themselves. Caroline keeps saying \"Jack, that's enough,\" and Marian says, \"Dwight's not that bad.\" But they can't help laughing. Toby offers the other two women a light, then offers a broom, the back door, and the refrigerator a light. \n45   INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY                                45 The principal, MR. SHIPPY, sits behind his desk. Toby, looking scared, sits across from him. A secretary lets Caroline into the room. Mr. Shippy rises and introduces himself. Caroline doesn't respond to the introduction. CAROLINE What did he do? MR. SHIPPY He violated the school property and flouted the law. CAROLINE Can you say that in English? (CONTINUED) \n45   CONTINUED:                                                  45 MR. SHIPPY He wrote obscene words on the wall. CAROLINE (to Toby) Did you do it? (as he shakes his head \"no\") He didn't do it. MR. SHIPPY (strong) He wrote obscene words on the wall. \nCAROLINE What obscene words? MR. SHIPPY (after a beat) 'Fuck you.' CAROLINE That's one obscene word. Mr. Shippy looks stymied.   There is a pause. MR. SHIPPY Look, Mrs. Wolff, Jack's teachers, like him but they think he's fallen in with the wrong kind of friends. (peers at Toby's hand) Is that nicotine stain on your fingers? (as Toby shakes his head \"no\") I hope not. Let me tell you a story: I started smoking in college. Two packs a day. I ate 'em. (a beat) One night I went to have a cigarette and lo and behold, the pack was empty. I went downstairs and started to rummage through the garbage cans. But as I reached down -- I mean, right down into a garbage can -- I suddenly thought, 'Whoa. Hold on right there, Buster.' I went back to my room and to this day I haven't smoked another cigarette. (MORE) (CONTINUED) \n45    CONTINUED:   (2)                                               45 MR. SHIPPY (CONT'D) (a beat) After that, every day I saved the exact amount of money I would've spent on cigarettes. In three years, I put it all together, and you know what I bought? I bought myself... (a dramatic pause; big finish) ... a Nash Ambassador. Caroline gives a bark of laughter. She brings out a handkerchief and coughs, as if she has a cold. Mr. Shippy looks puzzled. \nMR. SHIPPY Well, back to the point:   I think two weeks' suspension. \n51   INT. BUICK - NIGHT                                              51 Dwight is still drinking, between swallows, he gives Toby sneering glances. Dwight is driving very fast. The road begins a series of curves. Dwight doesn't slow down, and the TIRES begin to SCREAM on the curves. The road runs along a steep gorge. Dwight increases the speed, and the car begins to fishtail. TOBY I'm a little sick to my stomach. DWIGHT Sick to your stomach?   A hotshot like you? TOBY I'm not a hotshot. (CONTINUED) \n51   CONTINUED:                                                    51 DWIGHT That's what I hear. I hear you're a real hotshot. Come and go where you please, do what you please. Isn't that right? Yeah, regular man about town. Performer, too. That right, Jack? You a performer? TOBY No, sir. DWIGHT That's a goddamned lie. Dwight keeps glancing from the road to Toby, and back again. DWIGHT If there's one thing I can't stomach, it's a liar. TOBY I'm not a liar. DWIGHT Sure you are. You or Marian. Is Marian a liar? She says you're quite the little performer. Is that a lie? You tell me that's a lie and we'll drive back to Seattle so you can call her a liar to her face. You want me to do that? TOBY No. \nDWIGHT Then you must be the one's a liar, right? (as Toby nods) And you're a performer? TOBY I guess. DWIGHT You guess? You guess? Let's see your act. Go on. Do your act. (when Toby is silent) I'm waiting. TOBY I can't. (CONTINUED) \n51   CONTINUED:   (2)                                              51 DWIGHT Sure you can. TOBY No, sir. DWIGHT Do me.     I hear you do me. Again Toby shakes his head, and then gasps as the CAR SKIDS hideously close to the cliff's edge. Dwight is oblivious to the danger. DWIGHT Yeah, I hear you're good at doing me. Here. Do me with the lighter. Go on. Take it. Dwight holds out the velvet-covered Zippo, driving with one hand, and the car is all over the road. Dwight puts the lighter back into his pocket. The car slows a bit. DWIGHT Hotshot. You pull that hotshot stuff around me and I'll break every bone in your body. You understand me? (a beat) You're in for a change, mister. You got that? Huh? You got that good? (so scary) You're in for a whole 'nother ballgame. \n52   EXT. DWIGHT'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                   52 Dwight's Buick pulls to a stop as Norma, Skipper and Pearl come out to meet them. Dwight is calmer now. DWIGHT Skipper, go get that washtub out back, and Pearl, bring the hose around and fill it up. Hotshot and me hit a beaver. We'll salt him down. Skipper and Pearl move out on the run. Dwight slits the beaver from throat to testicles, guts it, then pulls the skin off. (CONTINUED) \n52   CONTINUED:                                                     52 DWIGHT I know you think you're better than me. Caroline told me all about your rich daddy and your prep-school brother, but your fancy days are over: you're a Concrete boy now. I'm gonna give you a big injection of Concrete. That's right -- inoculate you. Oh, my, yes. You're gonna find out that in Concrete we have to be able to do more than sing Fats Domino songs, we work... Skipper and Pearl bring the tub with four blue stars painted on its side, Dwight plops the skinned beaver into the water. The hairless carcass stands in the tub, its chin on the edge. Pearl shudders and turns away. \n53   INT. DWIGHT'S KITCHEN - SAME NIGHT (LATER)                     53 Dwight, Toby, Norma, Skipper and Pearl are eating dinner at the kitchen table. Norma speaks to Toby. NORMA You'll be in Miss Graham's class? TOBY Yeah, is she nice? NORMA She's okay.   She's pretty. TOBY I hate changing schools. DWIGHT Speaking of changing, I had a talk with Jack on the way up here, and he says he wants to be a better boy. And that's good, 'cause things weren't going well for him in Seattle: the police actually came to his house to talk to Caroline about him. Uh-huh, the police. PEARL (very low; to Toby) Criminal. (CONTINUED) \n53   CONTINUED:                                                   53 DWIGHT So here's what I think: I think idle hands are the devil's workshop, and so I found our Jack a little something to do. (to Toby) I picked up two barrels of horse- chestnuts in the park. You can spend your evenings hulling 'em. And I enrolled you in the Boy Scouts, and you've got a paper route, starting Monday, every afternoon from three to six-thirty -- pays fifty-five bucks a month. What d'you say? \nToby glances around the table, he is subdued. TOBY I'll do it. (means it) I want to be... better. DWIGHT That's what I like to hear. Okay, you guys get these dishes cleaned up. Let's show Jack how we do it in Concrete. \n56   INT. DWIGHT'S LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON                        56 Toby and Pearl are playing a card game called \"Slap- Jack.\" Toby slaps a card down hard, yelling \"I win again!\" and Pearl pouts. \nPEARL That's no fair. You make me sick. I don't know why you have to live here, anyway. Daddy says we should think of it like you were a charity kid. Toby takes out his comb, combs his hair a bit, then holds it out to Pearl, an exaggerated look of innocence on his face. TOBY Wanna comb your hair, Pearl? Pearl covers her bald spot with one hand. TOBY Probably you do, since you've got such pretty hair.  I know if I had hair as pretty as yours, Pearl, I'd comb it all the time. \nPearl is on the verge of tears. There are THREE TREMEN- DOUSLY LOUD FLAT-FOOTED KICKS against the front door. DWIGHT (O.S.) Open the hell up! I got us a treat! Pearl opens the door revealing a beaming Dwight holding two dishpans piled high with snow. We see through the doorway that the sun is shining and there isn't snow anywhere. PEARL We're gonna have snowcream! \n57   INT. DWIGHT'S KITCHEN - LATER                                 57 Dwight, Toby, Skipper, Norma, and Pearl are enjoying the snowcream. DWIGHT ... heard there was a fresh snow this morning, so I drove up to the mountains. I stopped in a field where it was all clean. I was finished packing it up high when somebody said... (prissy voice) This's private property, in case you're interested. (normal voice) I turned around and there was this woman... (he shudders) Yechh! Ugliest woman I ever saw -- ugly as a madman's ass she was. And frowning on top of it. Everybody laughs. NORMA Oh, Daddy! DWIGHT She was! TOBY (to Pearl; soft; happy) You're ugly as a madman's ass. PEARL No, you are. \nSKIPPER What'd you say to the ugly woman? DWIGHT I didn't say nothin' -- I ran. Everybody laughs again.    They eat in silence for a beat. DWIGHT I'm gonna get you a Scout uniform, Jack. TOBY (surprised, pleased) Really? (CONTINUED) \n57   CONTINUED:                                               57 PEARL Can I join the Girl Scouts? DWIGHT I'm getting one for me, too. Don't believe in doing anything halfway. If you're serious about the Scouts... (as Toby nods) ... then I want you to do it right. We'll do it right together. Dwight takes out a magazine entitled Boy's Life.    He hands it to Toby. \nDWIGHT I got you a subscription to this. I'll take the price out of your paper route money. TOBY Boy's Life? DWIGHT It's the official Scout magazine. Tells about what it means to be a Scout, what kind of boy you need to be, and, oh, about merit badges and stuff like that. Toby opens the book at random, reads from it. TOBY 'Suggested good turns a Scout can do: assist a foreign  boy with some English grammar.  Help put out a burning field.  Give water to a crippled dog.'  I could do those. DWIGHT Hell, yes, you could. You're a bright kid. I want this Scout thing done right, okay? Toby nods, enthusiastic, happy. \n58   INT. TOBY AND SKIPPER'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON              58 Toby stands in front of a full-length mirror wearing a huge Scout uniform that's been unsuccessfully cut down for him. (CONTINUED) \n58   CONTINUED:                                             58 The shirt-sleeves have been shortened but the shoulders extend two inches beyond the ends of his shoulders. The pants legs have been cut off and hemmed but the crotch of the trousers hangs down three inches too low, giving him a stumpy, dwarfish look. Toby yells to someone O.S. TOBY I'm not going. DWIGHT (O.S.) The hell you say. TOBY I'm not. Cut down Skipper's old stuff, and he's twice as big as me -- I'm gonna stay home. DWIGHT (O.S.) You're gonna shit and fall back in it -- that's all you're gonna do. Now get out here. \n62   EXT. CAROLINE'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON                             62 \nToby and Caroline walk slowly, idly down the rail tracks. Toby avoids her eyes. CAROLINE How is it in Concrete? TOBY It's fine. CAROLINE School? TOBY School's school. My grades are okay. CAROLINE You haven't been in any trouble? (as he shakes his head) Good. How're you and Dwight? TOBY He made us all snowcream, like he said. CAROLINE Stop that, honey. TOBY What? CAROLINE (stops walking) Well, you've got your eyes out of focus. Look at me. Now, are things all right? (CONTINUED) \n62   CONTINUED:                                               62 TOBY I'm fine. CAROLINE You swear?   You act odd. TOBY No, I'm fine. CAROLINE Well, good. I'd feel awful if it hadn't worked out. A pause. \nCAROLINE I told Dwight I'd marry him. In two weeks. I don't know what else to do. I mean, he's been helping me with the rent since Kathy left. And you need a father. I think it's the best thing all the way around -- what d'you think? There is a pause as they look at each other. TOBY I think it's the best thing. CAROLINE I think it's the best thing, too. Caroline smiles, smooths his hair, then goes into the house. Toby continues to walk. Suddenly, he spins around and tears out toward the house. By God, he'll tell her just what's been going on. He bangs through the front door and up the stairs. \n63   INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY                                         63 Toby stops dead as he sees Dwight and Caroline locked in a busy kiss. He stops dead and shrinks back into the hallway, defeated. DISSOLVE TO: \n64   INT. SKIPPER AND TOBY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                        64 Toby is alone in the room    in his Boy Scout shirt and hat in front of a mirror. A     copy of Boy's Life magazine is open in front of him with    drawings of Indians performing sign language. Watching     himself in the mirror, Toby makes a sign. (CONTINUED) \n64    CONTINUED:                                            64 TOBY Hungry. He makes another sign. TOBY Food. He makes another sign. TOBY Want. He makes another sign. \nTOBY Great mystery. He makes another sign. TOBY Father. He stares silently at himself in the mirror. \nA65   INT. DWIGHT'S LIVING ROOM - DAY                             A65 Tarpaulins are everywhere. Toby stands surrounded by seven five-gallon cans of paint. Carrying paintbrushes, Dwight enters, dressed in old clothes singing \"In The Still Of The Night.\" DWIGHT Now that's a song. Not all this Elvis Presley shit. Elvis sings about like I do brain surgery. He imitates Elvis -- moves his hips slightly and sings a few notes: DWIGHT '... uh-huh-huh, my blue suede shoes.' Dwight gives Toby a flash of his teeth and Toby smiles back. DWIGHT Let's get this place ready for Caroline. They begin painting.   After only a few strokes, though, Toby looks doubtful. (CONTINUED) \n73   CONTINUED:                                              73 Dwight sits down next to Toby, eager for details. DWIGHT How'd it start? TOBY I called him a sissy. Dwight hoots with laughter and slaps his leg. DWIGHT Well, he sure's hell can't sue you for slander. That boy fights for the pink team. Did you make him cry? \nTOBY Well... he was just ready to. I called him a big-assed, squat- to-pee sissy. (as Dwight slaps his leg again) I'd have won bigger except he hit me when I wasn't looking. DWIGHT (suddenly serious) He dry-gulched you. Now that's your fault. You gotta keep your guard up. There's no excuse for getting dry-gulched. I'll show you a couple moves after supper that'll leave Miss Arthur Gayle wondering what month it is. \n74   INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING                                    74 Still excited, Dwight is holding forth for the whole family. (We hear THUNDER of an approaching storm) DWIGHT ... so he says, 'You and who else's army?' 'Just the three of us,' I say. 'Me, myself and I.' (a beat) Well, after school he's waiting for me and he yells something -- I tell you, with people like that, you got to hurt 'em, gotta inflict pain, or they'll never leave you alone. (MORE) (CONTINUED) \n74   CONTINUED:                                             74 DWIGHT (CONT'D) (a beat) So it was real hot out, okay? And there were these horse turds laying all over the place. I picked one up and went up to him, but not acting tough, okay? Acting more like, 'Oh gee, I'm so scared, please don't hurt me.' Sort of like this: Dwight slumps his shoulders, drops his chin, and looks up through his eyebrows, a simpering expression on his face. DWIGHT So I say, 'Excuse me, but what's the problem?' And he starts in on me again, blah, blah, blah, and I jam a horse turd right into that big mouth. Then I give him a sucker punch in the breadbasket, and he goes down like a... Dwight goes on, relishing the story. \n75   EXT. UTILITY PORCH - NIGHT                                   75 A steady downpour falls outside the porch. Dwight and Toby, both stripped to the waist, are boxing. Dwight is totally serious about this, absolutely sincere. The sweat streaming off the two, Dwight patiently corrects Toby's movements, or catches the boy's fist to suggest better form. Their feet shuffle, squeak on the floor. DWIGHT No, no. From the shoulder. Straight. (demonstrates) Like this. This. Otherwise you leave yourself wide open. (as Toby tries) Yeah, better, better... and keep those feet moving, shuffle, shuffle, that's right... now try for my face... good... \n76   INT. LIVING ROOM - PARALLEL TIME                             76 Caroline is on the telephone, her voice low. (Behind her, through a doorway, we can see Dwight and Toby boxing.) (CONTINUED) \n76   CONTINUED:                                              76 CAROLINE ... not good, to tell you the truth not good at all. (listens) No, he's not mean to me... (listens again) No, he's good about that: comes home right after work every night. (listens again) Oh, Marian, I don't know -- maybe I just got my hopes too high, although I don't think so. All I want is a little... (searches) ... a little son-of-a-bitching sweetness. That's all. (listens; laughs) You think so, huh? You always did have an eye for Dwight, didn't you? (leans back; watches Dwight and Toby) The thing is, he's out on the porch teaching Jack to box right now. I keep thinking if I can hang on, things'll settle down. If I can just hang on long enough, it'll work out and my kid'll have a father. You know? \n77   EXT. UTILITY PORCH - LATER                                    77 Both Dwight and Toby sweating heavily.    They lean against a wall, resting. \nTOBY You said you'd show me how to dry-gulch somebody. DWIGHT Okay. Now you can always  kick somebody in the balls, but I like this one better: What you  do is hit 'em in the throat with the side of your forearm. You  wait 'til -- hah! Without warning, Dwight lunges at Toby and swings the side of his arm toward Toby's throat. Toby dodges wildly, falling backward over a box of sports equipment. (CONTINUED) \n82   CONTINUED:                                              82 CAROLINE You remind me of a baby bird -- you know those frantic little things with their mouths wide open, wanting, wanting. TOBY Well, at least ask him about my gym shoes again. I can practice barefoot but for games I gotta have shoes. CAROLINE I'm not a referee. I won't do it. \nTOBY Oh, we know, we know: the bride won't argue. The bride won't raise her voice. CAROLINE Well, I'll tell you what    the bride will do: the bride will     get up and walk over there and    slap hell out of the bride's son.     Now does the bride's son want his    face slapped? TOBY Oh, I hate it here! I wish we could just get up and go. CAROLINE I don't have another 'get up and go' left in me! You understand? I'm telling you I've hit a god- damn wall. I can't run anymore. Now this whole thing isn't perfect for me, either... let me impress that on you real strong, okay? I don't wake up singing every morning. But I'm going to make this marriage work -- I won't join in any fights, you got that? I won't even raise my voice! Caroline points to the sink. CAROLINE See those two roses? He picked them for me on his way home last night. (CONTINUED) \n82   CONTINUED:   (2)                                              82 TOBY Big deal. CAROLINE I'm trying to concentrate on the good stuff. Norma appears in the kitchen door, wearing her cap and gown. She strikes a pose. NORMA What d'ya think? I think I look like a fool. (shrugs) Who cares? Six weeks to graduation, and California, here I come! Norma snaps her fingers and goes back to her bedroom. CAROLINE (lamely) Seriously: you have to concentrate on the good stuff. Caroline turns her attention back to the curtains. \n83   INT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S LIVING ROOM - SAME NIGHT           83 (LATER) \"The Lawrence Welk Show\" is ON the TELEVISION. Dwight, Caroline, Skipper, Norma and Pearl and Toby watch an Irish tenor sing a lugubrious ballad. Dwight stands in a corner of the room, his saxophone to his lips. He's playing along with the MUSIC, but silently. \nOccasionally he gets overcome and accidentally causes the saxophone to squawk. The Irish ballad ends, and Lawrence Welk's Champagne Orchestra strikes up a lively polka. Dwight takes a sip of his drink and grabs Caroline, pulls her to her feet, and begins to dance with her. A polka can be a decorous, contained dance. He dances Caroline vigorously around the living room, out into the kitchen, around the table, and then back again. Dwight is really good, and Caroline matches him every step of the way. Skipper turns the  VOLUME UP and Dwight kicks the dance into an even higher, wilder gear: The kids clap on the beat, the two whirl and stamp and spin. (CONTINUED) \n83   CONTINUED:                                              83 Faster and faster -- Caroline's heel catches an end table and sends it spinning and faster they go. Caroline's head is thrown back; she's laughing with pleasure. As the MUSIC reaches its CLIMAX, Dwight spins Caroline back to the sofa, lets her go, and WHAM! she lands back where she was seated exactly on the last note of the song. Amid the general laughter and applause, Caroline smiles at Toby. CAROLINE (breathy) Try to find the good stuff, honey. \n84   INT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON            84 Dwight and Toby face one another in the living room. Both wear their Scout uniforms. Dwight holds a box of chocolate-coated cherries in one hand. TOBY I'm telling you I didn't. DWIGHT And I know damn well you did. TOBY Well, you're wrong. DWIGHT About some things, yeah. Not about this. You're a goddam hog, and I proved it. TOBY How do you know Skipper didn't eat it? Or Norma? Or Pearl? DWIGHT I told all three of them to stay away from this candy for twenty- four hours. TOBY Well, how do you know I even ate any? DWIGHT (a triumphant smile) I counted them. You hogged down eleven chocolate covered cherries since yesterday afternoon. (CONTINUED) \n84   CONTINUED:                                             84 TOBY So what? DWIGHT So that makes you a hog. I just wanted to establish that fact, and now I have. Caroline and Skipper enter, carrying throw pillows and materials. DWIGHT (to Caroline and Skipper) Hey. Mr. Hotshot Hog and I've just been establishing some facts, and what we come up with is this: One, he's a pig who gobbles down everybody's candy; two, he lies about it; three, he lays around on his lazy ass day and night reading, reading; and four, he's not getting any ten-dollar gym shoes. That's about what we've come up with so far. SKIPPER Oh, Dad... DWIGHT (a high, mincing voice) Oh, Dad! Skipper leaves the room. Caroline sits down, begins to try various materials as coverings for the pillows. \nTOBY (to Caroline) Why don't you ever take up for me? DWIGHT (to Caroline) Why don't you ever help me straighten that boy out? Caroline doesn't even look up. She threads a needle and begins to sew. Whilst Dwight paces around the room. DWIGHT All he does is read or listen to records or sing. (MORE) (CONTINUED) \n87   EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT                               87 Toby and Arthur are eating ice cream cones and smoking cigarettes at the same time. They walk slowly, desultorily. Though still effeminate, Arthur has dropped much of the flounciness that he uses in public. ARTHUR ... Tobias? Your real name is Tobias? Toby... Tobias... I like it -- it's very elegant. (MORE) (CONTINUED) \n87   CONTINUED:                                              87 ARTHUR (CONT'D) My real parents would probably have given me an elegant name, too. I say 'real parents' because I suspect I'm a foundling. Somebody royal -- or at least very, very beautiful had me and gave me to my poor but honest mother. (a beat) Tell me more about you. TOBY (shrugs) Every day of my life feels like a mile on the Bataan Death March. \nARTHUR (laughs) I knew I'd like you. TOBY Why'd you point at me that day? ARTHUR Because you're an alien. You don't belong in Concrete any more than I do. This place would like to kill us because we're different. TOBY Oh, come on, Arthur.   That's a little dramatic. ARTHUR Think so? You know what chickens do if one chicken's born with a little difference? With a few black feathers on its head, say? They peck at the black spot 'til the chicken's dead -- they can't stand the fact that it's different. Now we're both different. Your difference is something other than... (husky-voiced actress) ... my difference... (normal tone) But we're both aliens here. TOBY I don't exactly feel like an alien. I've got friends here. (CONTINUED) \n87   CONTINUED:   (2)                                              87 ARTHUR Yes, and they're fools. And you act like a fool when you're around them. A prediction: if you stay in Concrete, you'll wind up working at the A&P -- either that or you'll go on a rampage with a hunting rifle. TOBY Yeah, and you'll wind up a recluse that everybody says likes to dress up in his mama's old clothes. ARTHUR (laughs) Maybe, maybe, but no matter how many times I have to repeat: my primary goal's to get out of Concrete. TOBY Burma-Shave! Arthur and Toby laugh.   As they walk on, though, Toby's face is thoughtful. \n88   INT. SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT                                 88 Toby and ten other boys are practicing lay-ups. All the boys, Toby included, wear basketball uniforms. All the other boys wear gym shoes. Toby is barefooted. He is however, a smooth, skillful player. \n89   EXT. EDGE OF TOWN - AFTERNOON                                 89 \nToby tosses his last newspaper into a yard, folds his sack, and stands wearily for a few beats. 90   INT. UTILITY PORCH - EARLY EVENING                            90 A large, ugly DOG next to the box of baseball bats and gloves GROWLS and snaps at Toby as he goes past. \n91   INT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S LIVING ROOM - EARLY EVENING        91 As Toby enters the room, Norma exits, wearing theatrical makeup and a gypsy costume. Behind her, drink in hand, sits Dwight, wearing a suit and tie, watching the TELEVISION NEWS with the SOUND VERY LOW. TOBY Whose dog is that on the porch? (CONTINUED) \n91   CONTINUED:                                              91 DWIGHT Yours. TOBY Mine? DWIGHT You said you wanted a dog. TOBY A collie, though. Not this one. DWIGHT Well, he's yours. You paid for him. Go get ready for Norma's play. \n95   CONTINUED:                                              95 CAROLINE (calm) Get his rifle back. DWIGHT But that dog's a champion! Caroline calmly SMASHES another PLATE on the countertop. CAROLINE Get his rifle back. DWIGHT Am I supposed to go clear to Seattle just to get... \nBefore he finishes the sentence, Caroline SMASHES a GLASS on the countertop. CAROLINE Get his rifle back. DWIGHT Jesus Christ, woman, I don't even know the guy's last name. Caroline picks up a bowl. DWIGHT All right, all right. The guy's supposed to send the A.K.C. papers. When he sends 'em, I'll know his name and address, and I'll go get the god-damn rifle back. Jesus. Caroline exits leaving Dwight, Norma, and Pearl with their mouths open. \n96   EXT. HOUSE - EVENING                                          96 Caroline walks to Toby, sits next to him on the stoop. CAROLINE Well, I did it -- and the bride didn't even raise her voice: he says he'll get the rifle back as soon as the guy who sold him the dog sends the papers. Toby nods.   Caroline looks up at the evening sky and then shrugs. (CONTINUED) \n96   CONTINUED:                                              96 CAROLINE 'Course, having seen that dog, I wouldn't suggest you hang by your thumbs 'til those papers come. I mean, that dog is ugly. Toby gives her a dirty look, but Caroline's smile makes Toby grin. CAROLINE That's nice -- I haven't seen a real smile out of you in a month. TOBY Oh, Mom, can't we leave here? I hate it so much. You don't like it either -- all you do is stick your head in a sewing machine night and day. Let's just leave and start over someplace else. CAROLINE 'Start over.' Do you know how many times I've started over, sweetheart? I don't want to do it anymore. This is as far as I want to go. This place. I have to make this work somehow. We do. You're fourteen now -- you have to help me. TOBY But if... CAROLINE But me no buts, honey. I told you: I've hit a wall. And besides, it's not so bad here, if you just try to -- TOBY If you say 'look for the good stuff,' I'm gonna get Dwight's 30/30 and shoot myself! CAROLINE Seriously, though: give the place a chance. Give him a chance. TOBY Great. Just great. What a life: I gotta live with Dwight... I got a sissy for a new best friend... (MORE) (CONTINUED) \n96   CONTINUED:   (2)                                           96 TOBY (CONT'D) I got no rifle... I got no gym shoes... CAROLINE Well, look on the bright side... You got a dog. In spite of his disappointment over the rifle, in spite of all that Caroline had said about staying with Dwight, Toby is happy to see Caroline completely back to her old self again, joking with him. He grins and, with the palm of his hand, he gives her shoulder a gentle shove. She returns the gesture. And the two of them sit on the steps, staring into the twilight. \n97   INT. ARTHUR GAYLE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY                      97 Arthur is playing the piano. He and Toby sing an old song called \"I Wandered Today To the Hill, Maggie.\" Both of them are enjoying it. As they finish the song, Arthur says a dry \"Will you be able to use your musical abilities at the A&P?\" Toby laughs and gives him a hard elbow in the ribs. \n98   INT. TOBY'S ROOM - NIGHT                            98 Toby is using a nail clipper over a wastebasket when he hears: DWIGHT (O.S.) Heh Hotshot! He looks up just in time to see a flashlight fly through the air toward him. He catches it. Dwight stands in the doorway. DWIGHT If you can tear yourself away from your pedicure, I want you to fetch me some of that paint from the attic. Dwight switches the room light off. TOBY Yeah. DWIGHT Is now too soon. TOBY God! \n99    INT. DWIGHT'S ATTIC                                           99 Dwight and Toby are looking for something. They both shine flashlights around the dark attic, illuminating old magazines, dolls, etc. Dwight says, \"I know I put 'em up here somewhere.\" Then Toby's flashlight lands on the unusual tub with the four blue stars which had held the beaver. Forgotten all this time, the beaver has transmogrified into a weird, two-foot high pile of what looks like cotton candy. And, hideously enough, the cloud-like stuff is still in the shape of the beaver. Then Dwight says, \"Shit -- the roof must've leaked on 'em.\" Toby turns to where Dwight shines his flashlight on the ten boxes of chestnuts. Also forgotten, the chestnuts are    covered with mold, too -- but a different kind: this     is wet, slick-looking stuff that rises off the chestnuts    like dough in a breadpan. A spasm of rage crosses     Toby's face, and he turns and bangs out of the attic. \n100   INT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (LATER)        100 A drink in one hand, idly fondling Champ's ears with the other, Dwight is watching the NEWS. On the TELEVISION we see a distraught Lana Turner   and her daughter, Cheryl Crane, as the teenaged girl   is led into a tall building.  While we see this, and   then a photograph of a stockily handsome Italian man,   we hear: NEWSCASTER (V.O.) ... Cheryl Crane, daughter of Lana Turner, was held for questioning today in the stabbing death of Johnny Stompanato, Miss Turner's companion. A spokesman for Miss Turner said today that the stabbing was an accident, and that Miss Turner's daughter will not spend even one night in jail for what the spokesman called a 'tragic accident.' Suddenly aware of another presence in   the room, Dwight turns and sees Toby, who is standing   in the doorway, also listening to the NEWSCAST. Toby    is not watching the television, though, he is staring   fixedly at Dwight. Dwight reacts then glances back at the set, where the Stompanato murder story continues. He turns slowly back to Toby, whose eyes are still locked onto his face. The SOUND on the TV FADES. \nThere is a brief silence. Suddenly Caroline leans across the table and speaks to Dwight in a loud, exaggerated disappointed whine: CAROLINE Oh, Rickyyy! (louder; same whine) Oh, Ricky-y-y! Please let me come down and work at the club! DWIGHT What the hell are you doing? CAROLINE Well, you treat me like Lucy, I'll act like her. I'll be working for Kennedy's campaign. \n114   INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME NIGHT (LATER)                       114 \nThe four of them are watching \"The Untouchables.\" We watch as a frightened man speaks to Al Capone, who sits behind a large desk. FRIGHTENED MAN (V.O.) (on T.V.) ... please, Mr. Capone, it'll never happen again, I swear it. It was an accident. I can promise you faithfully it won't be repeated. Finally Al Capone speaks.   He leans across his desk, bugs out his eyes, and hisses: (CONTINUED) \n114   CONTINUED:                                               114 AL CAPONE (V.O.) (on T.V.) Why don't you take a little ride with Frank? The man's eyes bulge with fear, and he cries, \"No!    No!\" as two men escort him out the door. In the next shot we see a long black car parked on a country road, and we hear a SHOT. \n115   INT. BATHROOM - SAME NIGHT (LATER)                             115 Toby is brushing his teeth when Dwight enters. \nTOBY I'll be through in a minute. Dwight looks around. DWIGHT You left the lid off the damn toothpaste again. TOBY (not looking at him) Oh, Dwight, is that the best you can come up with? Angered, but keeping his voice low.   He pushes Toby's shoulder. DWIGHT This is my bathroom, and I say about the toothpaste, got it? (pushes again) Huh? Have you? Huh? Now if you lived with your daddy Duke and his rich wife, maybe things'd be different, but he's not here now, is he? (high, flutey voice) Oh, Duke? Duke, are you here? Dukie? Oh, how sad -- Duke's not here. Oh, boo hoo! (normal voice) My bathroom. I get to say. Got that? Still Toby doesn't respond -- Dwight reaches out and pinches the skin on Toby's waist, hard. Toby still doesn't respond, when Dwight begins to twist it. Toby spins around, eyes blazing. (CONTINUED) \n115   CONTINUED:                                              115 DWIGHT Come on. Oh, come on.     Give me an excuse. Toby hesitates, then leaves the bathroom, humiliated. \n116   INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT                                          116 Toby exits the bathroom, then sees Caroline in a doorway. She's heard it all. They look intently at each other. Toby nods and walks on down the hall. \n117   INT. TOBY'S ROOM - INSTANTS LATER                             117 \n120   CONTINUED:                                                  120 ARCH Nobody in your family ever even been in a Corvette, let alone owned one. CHUCK You wait and see if I don't get one. I'm gonna move down to Seattle, get a job at Bendix and drive a 'Vette to work every day. JERRY My uncle can have any car he wants. He makes big bucks as an electrician. \nARCH Yeah?   How big? JERRY Hundred seventy-five a week, take home. PSYCHO Bullshitter! JERRY Fuck you, it's true. CHUCK Even the supervisors at Bendix don't make that. JERRY So how are you ever gonna make enough to drive a 'Vette then, fuck-face? The others all laugh at Chuck. Toby has reached the group and stands on the lip of the large wooden platform that they are on and listens while leaning on a large hook. PSYCHO I'm gonna drive a T-bird, someday. CHUCK An' I'm gonna own a Corvette if I have to hold up the Bendix payroll to get it. JERRY Fuck you. (CONTINUED) \n120   CONTINUED:   (2)                                                120 ARCH Me. I want to eat a big red-haired pussy. The others all laugh at him.     Toby regards them with a sneer. TOBY Losers.   What a bunch of losers. CHUCK Who you calling a loser, fuck-face? TOBY All of you. (to Chuck) You're gonna drive a Fairlane just like your daddy does. (to Psycho) How you ever going to drive a Thunderbird when you're a janitor like the rest of your family? (to Jerry) An' you can forget being an electrician, you can't even pass tenth grade math. JERRY Well fuck you.     Who died an' made you King Shit? PSYCHO Yeah, you're no better than us. TOBY I know that, Psycho. That's my point: Ha, ha, ha. You guys are my buddies. You guys are my pals. And my dear old dad's called Dwight. (he spreads his arms wide) Welcome to Concreeee... Toby topples over and falls down a bank of rubble. The other burst out laughing and hooting. The CAMERA MOVES off them and CRANES DOWN to a spread-eagled Toby's face. The LAUGHTER ECHOES around the building. Toby begins to laugh, but it soon turns to bitter tears. DISSOLVE TO: \n121   OMITTED                                                         121 \n122   INT. KENNEDY CAMPAIGN OFFICE - DAY                         122 Toby enters the small office where Caroline is running hundreds of flyers on a duplicating machine. Surprised she sees Toby's expression. CAROLINE What is it? TOBY I called Gregory at Princeton. (as Caroline reacts) He's sending me applications for prep schools. I need you to take me to Seattle to take some entrance exams. \nCAROLINE Would a prep school take you with, uh, your school record? TOBY I've got to get out of here, Mom. I've got to. I've got to get away. CAROLINE When are the tests? TOBY Saturday. CAROLINE You'll be there. TOBY He won't let you have the Buick. \nCAROLINE You'll be there! \n123   EXT. LAKESIDE SCHOOL IN SEATTLE - DAY                      123 Graceful buildings, green lawns, a CARILLON CHIMING. Toby walks toward a large building. \n124   INT./EXT. TESTING ROOM - DAY                               124 Twenty-three boys and Toby stand waiting restlessly for the tests to begin. Toby looks very different from the other intelligent looking, well-bred boys in his Elvis hairdo. \n131   INT. SCHOOL WORKSHOP - DAY                                   131 Toby is working with a table saw. Suddenly a two-inch- thick manilla envelope plops down beside him. He looks up to see Arthur standing beside him. Glancing around to see that he's unobserved, he checks the contents of the envelope: we see school stationery, blank transcript forms, and a stack of official envelopes. Toby closes his eyes. He's saved. (CONTINUED) \n131   CONTINUED:                                                  131 TOBY You could leave too, you know. ARTHUR No, I've grown progressively fond of Concrete. I think I'll stay here all alone and dress up in my mama's old clothes sometimes -- like you said. Arthur turns and    swishes away. Toby pats   the manilla envelope, turns    back to the saw. Suddenly   he jerks, looks down, and    sees that the ring finger  of his left hand is spurting    blood. Toby says a mild,   astonished \"Hey,\" and sinks    to his knees. \n132   INT. TYPING LAB - SAME DAY (AFTERNOON)                            132 With his hand bandaged Toby sits at a typewriter with a blank transcript. He carefully types \"TOBIAS WOLFF.\" Then, he begins to type the letter \"A\" in every slot for grades. \n133   EXT. STREET - EVENING                                             133 Toby mails five letters. \n134   INT. TOBY'S BEDROOM - DAY                                         134 Toby lies in bed reading the paper. He still holds his hand in the air (the white bandage is now dingy). \nCaroline appears in the doorway. CAROLINE Come help me stuff envelopes. TOBY I'll do some this afternoon. CAROLINE No, I need to take them with me. TOBY I'll be in in a minute.    Let me finish this article. (CONTINUED) \n134   CONTINUED:                                              134 CAROLINE Boy, you irritate me. (new tone) I think maybe you ought to... Yeah -- I think maybe you should just... (hisses) ... TAKE A LITTLE RIDE WITH DWIGHT. Toby laughs, and gets up to help her. \n135   EXT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S HOUSE - EARLY EVENING              135 \nToby starts up the sideway, Pearl exits the house with several letters in her hand. PEARL 'You got letters from those schools!' Toby grabs them as if they were the very stuff of life. Pearl stands expectantly. Toby notices her, then walks off holding the letters to his chest. \nExasperated that conversation is continuing when he's trying to listen, Dwight reaches over, presses his hand down on the arm of the record player, then SCRAPES it back and forth on the record. It's a violent action, and it makes a GROTESQUE SOUND. The NEEDLE BOUNCES around on the scarred record. As the three of them stare at him, Dwight speaks calmly: DWIGHT I was trying to listen to a record. Dwight rises, walks outside into the back yard. Then the TELEPHONE RINGS. Pearl answers it, listens, then says, PEARL \"Yeah, he's here,\" She holds the receiver out to Toby, whispering, \"Are you Tobias?\" \nTOBY Hello? All right.     Tomorrow, then. Goodbye. Toby hangs up, turns to Caroline, quietly: TOBY It's Hill School -- the last one I applied to. They haven't accepted me, but they're sending somebody up to interview me. Caroline upsets the puzzle getting up to hug Toby. \n141   INT. DRUGSTORE - AFTERNOON                                  141 Toby is sitting in a booth with MR. HOWARD, a man in his late thirties. Toby has made a real attempt to look good.    His hair is modified, and he wears a tie and a suit. TOBY ... Yeah, I enjoy my classes, especially the ones that are advanced, but I've been feeling a little restless lately. It's hard to explain. MR. HOWARD Well, you're probably bored. Not being challenged. Your application was very good, Toby, but we have many boys who want to go to Hill. Not everybody is comfortable at a prep school. TOBY I think I would be. My father and brother went to prep schools. MR. HOWARD Is that right?     Where? TOBY Deerfield and Choate. Mr. Howard is impressed. MR. HOWARD I see. Well, maybe you'd like it. Hill was difficult for me, though -- classes were hard, and the boys seemed cold -- interested in money and social position. (laughs) And I hated those snowy Pennsylvania winters! But then in my last year, something changed. The guys in my class grew close, so close that I still think of them as a second family. TOBY (honest) I want that. I do, and -- (CONTINUED) \n141   CONTINUED:                                              141 He stops    talking as we hear, O.S., \"AG-H-H-H!\" Psycho and Arch have    entered the drugstore. Toby's back is to the door, and    he slouches deeper into the booth, praying that he won't    be seen. Arch and Psycho buy cigarettes. ARCH ... so she said, 'No, I don't want you to do that,' and I said 'Oh, baby, let me get down and grovel on it.' I mean, I ate her pussy 'til my tongue was calloused, and then... \nArch moves toward the    back of the store toward the area where Toby sits. Toby     inches down a bit farther into the booth. Arch stops at     a sunglass rack five feet from Toby and tries on a couple    of pairs. ARCH ... so anyway, she went off like a Roman candle -- I mean that woman can scream. I said, 'You liked that, didn't you, baby?' I said, 'You liked the old Arch Cook special, didn't you?' Arch decides to let the sunglasses go. He and Psycho move toward the front of the store, he talks about pussy. Toby exhales. MR. HOWARD Toby, boys at Hill talk roughly sometimes too -- you'd have to be ready for that. I can see you've had sort of a sheltered life. Toby nods his head. \n142   EXT. DRUGSTORE - AFTERNOON                                    142 Mr. Howard shakes Toby's hand. MR. HOWARD You seem like a fine boy, and I'll give you a good report tomorrow. But there are lots of boys applying, and we'll just have to wait and see whether -- From O.S., we hear Dwight's voice, and Toby goes rigid. (CONTINUED) \n142   CONTINUED:                                              142 DWIGHT (O.S.) Ohh, it's the Hotshot Boy. Both Mr. Howard and Toby turn to see Dwight, wearing his coveralls, ten feet away. DWIGHT Yeah, it's the guy who thinks he knows everything. Thinks he's so smart, but fella, what you don't know would fill a book. (glances at Mr. Howard's new Chevrolet; offhand) General Motors makes shit cars. \nDwight turns and enters the drugstore. TOBY (weakly) That's, uh, that's this guy... he's a mechanic... did some bad work on our car... It's not much of an explanation, but Mr. Howard seems to buy it. He says goodbye to Toby, gets into his car, drives away. Toby stares after him. DISSOLVE TO: \n143   INT. A & P GROCERY STORE - NIGHT                              143 A few weeks have passed. Toby (his Elvis hairdo further modified) again prices and stacks food. His face is serious, his manner industrious. \n", "test1_input": "24A   EXT. TRACT HOUSE/FURTHER DOWN STREET - AFTERNOON          24A From one of the houses TERRY TAYLOR emerges, falling into step with Toby. He's Toby's age, and is almost an exact replica of him. TOBY Hey, Terry. TERRY TAYLOR Hey, Jack. What'd your mom say about skipping school today? TOBY Who listens? TERRY TAYLOR You go over to Wanda's house last night? (as Toby nods) You make out good? (as Toby nods again) How good? TOBY I fucked her 'til her nose bled. TERRY TAYLOR Sure you did!    Oh, Wolff, you're rich. \n25    INT. APARTMENT - AFTERNOON                                25 TERRY SILVER opens the door to admit Toby and Terry Taylor. Silver is a clone of both Toby and Terry Taylor. \n26   INT. LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON                                  26 As the three boys troop through the room, they pass Terry Silver's two SISTERS, who are sprawled sensually on a sofa. SISTER #1 Oh look -- it's Elvis, Elvis, and Elvis. TERRY TAYLOR Excuse me, but does your face hurt? 'Cause it's killing me. With that piece of high wit, they're out of the room. \n27   INT. TV ROOM - AFTERNOON                                27 The boys light up three cigarettes (opening a window so the smoke will disappear), then throw themselves onto the floor in front of a black-and-white TV. Superman is ON. When Lois Lane comes on, Terry Taylor starts moaning as if sexually aroused; Terry Silver jumps to his knees and licks the TV screen repeatedly, also moaning. Toby closes his eyes, also as if in sexual transport. TOBY Oh, Lois. Oh, baby, come here -- I got six hot inches just waiting for you. TERRY TAYLOR Man, look at her! Look at that body-y-y-y. \nTERRY SILVER (continues licking screen) Um-m-m-m. M-M-M. Oh, Annette, I want you. I want you so bad. TOBY Oh, babybabybabybabybaby... You make my dick hard!

Then, slowly, they shut up and lie back down. \n27A   SAME SCENE - LATER                                           27A And this is what they really wanted: absolutely silent, all three boys stare fixedly at the screen. They are totally absorbed, caught up in the sweetness and warmth of the show. Not one of these boys has ever touched a girl's breast; all three are at least two years from their first shave; all three are pre-pubescent, and their sexuality is all bravado -- now we see them for what they are: three skinny-armed 13-year-olds, fascinated by Superman. \n28    INT. TOBY AND CAROLINE'S KITCHEN - DUSK                      28 Caroline pirouettes for her two roommates, KATHY, a diffident, sweet-faced young woman, and MARIAN, a heavyset, loud, red-faced woman who eats compulsively from a package of oatmeal cookies. Both of the women ooh and aah over Caroline's dress. KATHY That belt just makes it. CAROLINE It does pick up the green, doesn't it? MARIAN And you say he's getting serious already? CAROLINE Yes, I think. He keeps talking about marriage, keeps saying he wants to meet Toby. MARIAN Well, that's it -- three dates and you got 'im good. CAROLINE I don't know if I want him -- She stops as Toby enters the kitchen. (CONTINUED) \n28   CONTINUED:                                               28 TOBY Don't want who?

I told you about Dwight. TOBY He the one drives down from the boondocks? The mechanic? Dwight. What a stupid name. (he draws the name out) Dwiiiight. Duhhhhwight. Dwight-tah-h-h-h. Dwighttahhhhh. There is a KNOCK    on the front door. Toby sticks his head around the door,    looking into the living room. A man is outlined against    the sunset, only his black silhouette is visible. It is     our first glimpse of DWIGHT. Has the man heard him?     Toby doesn't know for sure. Caroline brings Dwight into the kitchen.     He is older than her, an attractive-enough man. He     is well-built, has a full head of brown hair, and very    white teeth. Those are his good points. On the minus     side: his over- eagerness to please, his nervous smiles    and his clothes. He wears two-tone shoes, a hand-painted    tie, and a monogrammed handkerchief, folded beyond    perfection, in the pocket. Caroline introduces him to Marian and Kathy.     Then she introduces Dwight to Toby. Dwight is all smiles. CAROLINE Would you like coffee before we go? Or a Coke? DWIGHT You know, I believe I could stand a cup of java.

Dwight takes a swallow of the coffee.     His eyes widen. DWIGHT Who made this? CAROLINE I did... DWIGHT Well, well, well, all I can say is that you people are pretty lucky to live in a house where -- oh. Marian puts a cigarette into her mouth. Dwight jumps up, pulls a velvet case from his pocket and extracts a mono- grammed Zippo. He snaps open the top of the lighter against his leg, and holds the flame in front of Marian's face. She lights her cigarette. Then Dwight perform the Zippo drama in reverse. What a conversation stopper.     Finally, Kathy speaks to Toby. KATHY I hear you're invited up to Dwight's next week for Thanksgiving. DWIGHT Aw, you'll love it. Great air, great water. For scenery, all you have to do is step outside your front door and open your eyes. And there's a turkey shoot Thanksgiving Day. Your mom said you might like it, so I signed you up. Toby sits up, eager. TOBY Really? I can shoot my Winchester? Great! I bet I could be the one to get the turkey.

(notices the time) Dwight, we're going to be late. She grabs her coat (which Dwight jumps up to hold for her) and they exit. As Dwight leaves he kisses his hand, then throws the kiss toward Marian and Kathy. The instant the front door slams: TOBY                MARIAN                      KATHY What a geek.      I love a man knows      He's so appealing. how to dress. \n29   EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - AFTERNOON                            29 We hear SCREAMING. Toby and Terry Taylor race BY the CAMERA on stolen tricycles, yelling as if they're attack- ing Indians. Behind them comes Terry Silver, on foot. Atop a small hill, both boys jump off, letting the TRICYCLES SMASH into a parked car. Then they run like hell with Terry Silver bringing up the rear. \n30   INT. CAROLINE AND TOBY'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING                 30 Caroline is dressed casually. Toby has on a shirt and sweater. He is pretending that he's buck-toothed. Caroline finishes packing a small suitcase. CAROLINE I want you to be polite to Dwight this weekend. \nTOBY (buck-toothed speech) Okay. CAROLINE I mean it, now. TOBY (buck-toothed speech) I said 'Okay,' didn't I? CAROLINE Hey, c'mon, maybe the weekend'll be fun... maybe Concrete will be pretty.

TOBY (buck-toothed speech) Stop what? CAROLINE Sometimes I could kill you as free as I could eat a bite. \nTOBY (buck-toothed speech) Ditto. A car stops and through a window, we see Dwight. Caroline turns to Toby. CAROLINE Please be nice. Toby stops the buck-toothed thing and speaks normally. TOBY All right. \n", "test2_input": "67   INT. DWIGHT'S LIVING ROOM - PARALLEL TIME                   67 Caroline is trying to stifle her laughter, as she stares at the wilderness of white.

Oh, I'm so sorry... don't know what's the matter with me... you're right... it does look clean... But she can't stop laughing.    Her laughter has just a tinge of hysteria. \n68   INT. SMALL CHURCH - MORNING                                     68 Dwight and Caroline are being married. Caroline wears a pale blue suit, and Dwight looks good in a navy single- breasted. Aside from Toby and Dwight's children, the only guests are Marian, Kathy, and three people we haven't seen before -- friends of Dwight's. \n69   INT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT                 69 The bed is a rat's nest of twisted sheets as Dwight   and Caroline make love. He takes his lips away from Caroline's breast and moves so that his head is at   the bottom of the bed. Holding her foot up, he kisses    the instep, then runs his tongue over the same spot and   then down under the arch of her foot. A sexy scene. DWIGHT M-m-m. There's not a straight line on you -- everything's curved. Caroline draws him up   to her, and they kiss. Then Dwight turns Caroline   on her side, away from him, pre- paring to enter her.    Caroline makes a small sound of protest, turning back   toward him. CAROLINE Oh, Dwight, not like that.    Not this time -- not tonight. DWIGHT It's good this way. CAROLINE But I want to see your face while we make love. DWIGHT (uncomfortable laugh) Oh, no -- I just don't... uh... like that way. (CONTINUED) \n69   CONTINUED:                                             69 Dwight continues to stroke Caroline, his hands everywhere, but now she is unresponsive. CAROLINE You mean you don't like to make love face to face? DWIGHT (same laugh) No, I don't like it. I can't handle it -- I don't like to see the face. CAROLINE You mean ever? \nDwight murmurs an assent.    Caroline is appalled. CAROLINE But that's grotesque... DWIGHT (stung; flares up) Look, you can get it doggie-style or you can get it laying on your side -- those are your only choices. This is my house, and I get to say. Wherever McGinty sits is the head of the table, you know? Disgusted, Caroline turns back away from Dwight. He shifts down on the bed a few inches, again preparing to enter her. \n70   INT. KITCHEN - NEXT MORNING                                  70 Toby is eating toast at the kitchen table. Norma has made a big breakfast, and she hurriedly pours the coffee when she hears Dwight and Caroline's bedroom DOOR OPEN. NORMA Happy Wedding Breakfast! Caroline's eyes    are red and swollen. Dwight turns ON a RADIO, sips his    coffee, and chats with Norma. Toby gives Norma's rear-end    an appreciative glance, then comes up behind Caroline,    speaking sotto voce: TOBY So how's the bride? (CONTINUED) \n70   CONTINUED:                                              70 CAROLINE Don't. TOBY The bride doesn't want to chat? CAROLINE Stop it. TOBY Well, the bride is sure snotty this morning. Smiling, Toby waits for some response to his teasing, but there is none. She turns away and sits at the table. \n71   EXT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - AFTERNOON                     71 Toby, his news bag slung over his shoulder, stands talking idly with two boys from school, OSCAR BOOKER and JIMMY VOORHEES. One of them says, \"Uh-oh,\" and jerks his head to indicate where Toby and the other boy should look. They look in the direction indicated, and see Arthur Gayle coming down the road toward them, followed by a small black dog called Pepper. As the boys watch Arthur's approach: TOBY What's his name again? OSCAR Arthur Gayle. \n", "test2_true": "71   CONTINUED:                                          71 OSCAR (to Toby) Call him a sissy. TOBY Why? OSCAR Just see what he says. JIMMY Yeah, do it. By this time Arthur is next to them. Smiling a superior smile, he stops and glances at all three of them as if they were just the oddest things he's ever seen. Then his eye falls on Toby's yellow hands. ARTHUR Oh, my, my -- look at all that yellow: Didn't your mama teach you to wash your hands after you pee? TOBY Oh, shut up. ARTHUR (rolls his eyes; heavily sarcastic) Now that's what I like -- an insult with some originality. Did you just make that up? Just now? So clever. TOBY Why don't you take a long walk off a short pier? ARTHUR (though he's not nearly close enough to smell Toby's breath) Excuse me, but has anyone ever told you your breath would gag a maggot? Both of Toby's friends laugh. TOBY Well, at least I'm not a great big sissy! Two things happen instantly: the superior smile vanishes from Arthur's face, and Toby's friends exchange a single expectant look: \"Here it comes.\" (CONTINUED) \n71   CONTINUED:   (2)                                             71 Without warning, Arthur swings a fist at Toby, catching him on the ear. Arthur's second blow hits him in the back of the head. The fight is on. Arthur throws   punches sidearm, with lots of wrist action, but there are   so many of them. Before Toby can react, Arthur has hit   him four times, including one wild haymaker that puts Toby   on his knees. While Toby's still on his knees, Arthur tries to kick him in the stomach. The kick is deadened by the papers in Toby's bag, Arthur bends over Toby, screaming as if he has lost his mind: \nARTHUR GET UP! GET UP, YOU SON OF A BITCHING MAGGOT GAGGER! I'LL STOMP YOUR GUTS OUT! I'LL KILL YOU! Toby gets up, and again Arthur sails in with those wild roundhouse swings. Then Toby gets in a solid punch to Arthur's face that rocks the bigger boy back on his heels. Arthur grabs his head and roars like a wounded buffalo. Almost immediately Arthur's eye puffs and begins to swell shut. Snot streaming from both nostrils, still roaring, Arthur flies at Toby again. Toby closes with him, to hold those flailing arms still, and the two stagger around the street like drunken dancers. They separate, exchange a few blows, then grapple with each other again. Then Arthur hooks Toby's leg, trips him, and the two roll off the shoulder of the road and down an embankment. They hit the muddy bottom of the gully still hitting, flailing, kicking -- first Toby is on top, then Arthur, then Toby, then Arthur. By now they are panting, each breath is a heave, a gasp. Then, suddenly, Arthur gives out completely -- he falls on top of Toby, pressing him deeper into the mud. With his last bit of strength Toby throws the bigger boy off him and sits up, while PEPPER BARKS FURIOUSLY at him and threatens to nip his leg. Toby staggers to his feet and starts to climb the gully. He looks relieved -- at least it's over. No, it's not. From behind him he hears three words. ARTHUR Take it back. (CONTINUED) \n71   CONTINUED:   (3)                                                71 Toby turns   to see a bloody-faced, swollen-eyed Arthur clambering   up the hill after him, like some monster that won't   die. Both boys reach the top and stand facing one   another. ARTHUR Take it back. Arthur's words are not angry anymore.    Toby's worn out too... TOBY Okay. ARTHUR Say it. TOBY Okay.   I take it back. ARTHUR No, say 'You're not a sissy.' Toby glances at Oscar and Jimmy. Their faces are gleeful but he doesn't care what the hell they think. TOBY You're not a sissy. Arthur immediately turns and walks away, but Toby ignores them and walks away in the opposite direction, delivering his hated newspapers. \n72   INT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S LIVING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON         72 \nCaroline is painting the white walls a soothing buff color.  On the sofa lie half-finished curtains she's making.  She is totally focused. She hears Toby, turns, sees his filthy clothes. Her shoulders sag. CAROLINE I won't do it, you know. I won't be a referee between the two of you. TOBY Who asked you? CAROLINE You both do. You do. Just by coming home like this you ask me to take your side when he raises hell. (MORE) (CONTINUED) \n72   CONTINUED:                                             72 CAROLINE (CONT'D) Well, the answer's 'No.' I'm going to make this marriage work. No fights. TOBY Oh, the bride is calm.   Who the hell cares? Caroline refuses to argue. She picks up a piece of material and holds it up to the window to see if her choice of color was a good one. CAROLINE (to herself) ... seems like this place is so ugly. Seems like everywhere I look there's something... ugly. \n73   INT. SKIPPER AND TOBY'S ROOM - EVENING                       73 A worried Toby sits dreading Dwight's arrival. Behind him, on the wall, Toby has pinned the covers of fifteen copies of the Scout magazine: so that, above Toby's head are the words BOY'S LIFE fifteen times. There is a MURMUR of VOICES, and FOOTSTEPS COMING toward Toby. Toby expects the worst. But, surprisingly, Dwight is beaming. DWIGHT Who won? TOBY (surprised) Uh, well, uh... he's the one can't see out of one eye. DWIGHT Hot damn! You actually gave little Lord Gayle a black eye? TOBY Well, it wasn't black yet. DWIGHT But it was all puffed up? (as Toby nods) Then it was a shiner. (CONTINUED) \n", "test3_input": "107    EXT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S HOUSE - DAWN                     107 Toby silently closes the garage door, the Buick inside and heads for the house. \n107A   SKIPPER AND TOBY'S ROOM - NOON                              107A The clock shows noon. Toby is in bed reading Boy's Life, holding a sandwich and trying to stay awake. Suddenly Dwight appears. Dwight puts his hands into his pockets, leans against the doorway. (CONTINUED) \n107A   CONTINUED:                                                  107A DWIGHT Your mother said you were sick. Feeling better? TOBY Yeah, I am. DWIGHT Good, good.    Get some sleep, did you? TOBY Yeah, I slept about four hours. DWIGHT Must've needed it. A pause: DWIGHT Oh, by the way, you didn't happen to hear a funny pinging noise in the engine, did you? TOBY What engine? DWIGHT I was downtown with Champ a few minutes ago, and I met a guy who recognized him. Said he'd seen my dog this very morning. Told me an interesting story of how he and the dog happened to meet. What d'you think about that? \nTOBY I don't know what you -- Suddenly Dwight is across the floor and onto the bed. He straddles Toby and slaps him across the face with the left hand then the right, again and again. Toby holds a forearm protectively across his face. Dwight holds both Toby's hands with one of his and, slaps the boy's face again and again. Finally Toby manages to get his right hand loose.      He slams his forearm across Dwight's throat. Dwight rears back, choking and gagging. Toby throws off the covers and tries to run. Still choking, Dwight grabs the back of Toby's hair and forces the boy's face down against the mattress. (CONTINUED) \n107A   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              107A Then he doubles up his fist and slams it into the back of Toby's neck. Toby goes rigid with pain. Dwight stumbles up gasping for breath. DWIGHT Only me. On this whole earth, to straighten you out. And I will do it kill or cure. Now get your ass up -- you're going to school. \n108    EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - NOON                                        108 A BELL RINGS as Dwight's BUICK SCREECHES to a stop and Toby gets out. As he heads toward the doors. Toby then turns to stare at Dwight's car. They lock eyes, then Dwight smirks and pulls away. Toby watches the car disappear, then spins around and walks into the school. FADE OUT. FADE UP TO: 108A   SAME SCENE - AFTERNOON                                         108A The CAMERA is in the EXACT SAME SPOT. The school seems a bit seedier, and two newly-planted saplings established in the previous scene are both eight feet taller, with wide spreading branches. Students pour out    the door. Among them Toby, taller and a bit heavier, he    now wears black leather boots, and a pack of cigarettes    rolled into the sleeve of his T-shirt. His hair is still    pure Elvis. \nToby comes back out the door with four very different friends. CHUCK BOLGER, the most reasonable-looking of Toby's companions, is the son of a minister. A second boy, known as PSYCHO, is a hulking boy with a tendency toward sadism. JERRY HUFF is handsome in a pouty, heavy- lidded way. His Elvis pompadour is even higher than Toby's. ARCH COOK is an amiable simpleton who sometimes talks to himself or laughs for no reason. Toby and his four friends pile into Chuck Bolger's '53 CHEVY, and they PEEL OUT. \n109    INT. CHUCK BOLGER'S CAR - NOON                                 109 As the car barrels through downtown Concrete, we see a movie marquee reading... (CONTINUED) \n109   CONTINUED:                                              109 ... The Apartment, and a five foot poster that says, \"ELECT JOHN KENNEDY, 1960.\" In the back seat, Psycho pours vodka into a half empty can of Hawaiian punch, then takes a huge swig. PSYCHO (screams it) Ag-Hhh! Gorilla blood. JERRY Oh, Psycho, shut up. CHUCK (pointing) Oh, look -- there goes Carol Baumgarten. Ain't she sweet? She's hot for Wolff. TOBY I wish. CHUCK Won't do her any good, though -- Jack's saving himself for Rhea Clark. TOBY Knock it off. JERRY You know what he said about Rhea? Said even the inside of her arm turned him on. You slay me, Wolff. She is pretty though. \n", "test3_true": "109   CONTINUED:   (2)                                              109 There is a pause while all the boys dwell on this thought. It sounds good to them. PSYCHO Aghhh, pussy! \n110   EXT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON             110 Chuck Bolger's CAR SCREECHES to a halt, and Toby exits, followed by an empty Hawaiian Punch can which someone tosses after him. Toby gives a wave, starts toward the house, and the CAR LAYS RUBBER, while OVER that we hear Psycho SCREAMING, \"AGH-H-H!\" \n111   INT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON           111 Pearl is setting the table and singing the Everly Brothers hit, \"Bye, Bye, Love.\" The passage of two years has improved Pearl. Her bald spot has grown back in, and she has learned to fix her hair and use makeup. She smiles and nods to Toby, never stopping her singing for a moment. Toby stands next to her and sings harmony for a few notes. It is clear that their relationship has improved. Toby stops singing. TOBY Where's Mom? Still singing, Pearl points to the living room. \n112   INT. LIVING ROOM - EARLY EVENING                              112 Caroline is watching a newscast of John Kennedy and Harry Truman at a press conference outside Truman's Missouri office. She hears Toby, turns to him. We see that the last two years have marked her. She's changed. Her expression is fixed, almost as if she were wearing a mask. Even the words are cheerful, but some of the old optimism is gone. CAROLINE Oh, honey, good news -- Truman's going to campaign for him. (lowers her voice) I gave twenty-five dollars to his campaign office today. I've been thinking I'd like to work... She is interrupted by Dwight's voice O.S. (CONTINUED) \n112   CONTINUED:                                              112 DWIGHT (O.S.) Here I am, you lucky people! Toby and Caroline exchange a glance.     It speaks volumes. 113   INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT                                          113 Dwight, Caroline, Toby and Pearl sit at the table, eat- ing. Champ sits by Dwight's chair -- obviously his dog. Dwight seems unchanged by the two years. Just now, Dwight is in the middle of telling another of his \"Dwight Is The Best\" stories. From the bored faces around the table, this is another in a long series. \nDWIGHT ... So the S.O.B. had been on my back for a week at work, okay? Sayin' I stole his wrench, an' poured oil all over his tools, as if! Anyway, he went just one step too far with old Dwight, okay? Spat on the floor as I walked by. I turned around and walked back to him, acting so dainty and humble and scared, you know, all innocent -- and the minute he took his eyes off me, BLAM, I dry gulched him! I shut his water off good! Never gave me another second's grief to this very day. There is a pause.   One more story.   Nobody has much of a reaction. \nCAROLINE I heard Kennedy on the news again tonight -- I don't know: I hate the Democrats and the Republicans, but then once in a while somebody comes along who doesn't seem like... (she searches) ... a liar. DWIGHT Kennedy -- the senator from Rome. CAROLINE He gives me hope. DWIGHT I know what he gives you, and it sure as hell isn't hope. (CONTINUED) \n113   CONTINUED:                                            113 CAROLINE (laughs) It's true he is attractive! And it may just be those white teeth that I respond to. But I don't think so. (a beat) I'm going to work for his campaign. DWIGHT No. Too many Republicans   in this town. They hear my wife's   working for the Democrats, they'll  take their cars someplace else  to be fixed. Bad idea. No. \n"}

131   INT. SCHOOL WORKSHOP - DAY                                   131 Toby is working with a table saw. Suddenly a two-inch- thick manilla envelope plops down beside him. He looks up to see Arthur standing beside him. Glancing around to see that he's unobserved, he checks the contents of the envelope: we see school stationery, blank transcript forms, and a stack of official envelopes. Toby closes his eyes. He's saved. (CONTINUED) 
131   CONTINUED:                                                  131 TOBY You could leave too, you know. ARTHUR No, I've grown progressively fond of Concrete. I think I'll stay here all alone and dress up in my mama's old clothes sometimes -- like you said. Arthur turns and    swishes away. Toby pats   the manilla envelope, turns    back to the saw. Suddenly   he jerks, looks down, and    sees that the ring finger  of his left hand is spurting    blood. Toby says a mild,   astonished "Hey," and sinks    to his knees. 
132   INT. TYPING LAB - SAME DAY (AFTERNOON)                            132 With his hand bandaged Toby sits at a typewriter with a blank transcript. He carefully types "TOBIAS WOLFF." Then, he begins to type the letter "A" in every slot for grades. 
133   EXT. STREET - EVENING                                             133 Toby mails five letters. 
134   INT. TOBY'S BEDROOM - DAY                                         134 Toby lies in bed reading the paper. He still holds his hand in the air (the white bandage is now dingy). 
Caroline appears in the doorway. CAROLINE Come help me stuff envelopes. TOBY I'll do some this afternoon. CAROLINE No, I need to take them with me. TOBY I'll be in in a minute.    Let me finish this article. (CONTINUED) 
134   CONTINUED:                                              134 CAROLINE Boy, you irritate me. (new tone) I think maybe you ought to... Yeah -- I think maybe you should just... (hisses) ... TAKE A LITTLE RIDE WITH DWIGHT. Toby laughs, and gets up to help her. 
135   EXT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S HOUSE - EARLY EVENING              135 
Toby starts up the sideway, Pearl exits the house with several letters in her hand. PEARL 'You got letters from those schools!' Toby grabs them as if they were the very stuff of life. Pearl stands expectantly. Toby notices her, then walks off holding the letters to his chest.

FADE IN: 
EXT. FOREST - NIGHT 
Darkness. The sound of battle cries and the clang of metal upon metal. The forest lights up with huge sparks flying from sword and ax as armored knights hack and swing at each other. Mounted knights collide head-on at full gallop, their armor made incandescent in the clash. Sparks eddy in their wakes and float to the ground. The forest catches fire. 
MAIN TITLES on the flames. Out of the sounds of ancient battle grows music, heroic and barbaric, shot through with melancholy. 
Two crazed eyes reflect the fire. The eyes belong to a man without age, at once ancient and boyish, female and male; his eyes are pained from the burden of too much knowledge. So close is he to the flames that a lock of his wild hair sizzles alight. He slaps at the fire as if it were an annoying insect. He wears a cloak of black trimmed with silver. It is Merlin. The wizard weaves a path through the burning forest, dodging the combatants, searching. 
MERLIN Lord Uther! Lord Uther! 
The forest around him weeps softly with the sounds that follow slaughter. Patches of undergrowth are smoldering. Small flames lick bark and branches. 
Smoke floats through the trees and hovers over the bodies of the dying and the dead. 
A huge knight reins up beside Merlin on a lathered horse. His armor is blood spattered. He is weary from battle. He looks down at Merlin, his countenance fierce. The blade of his sword glows with an unnatural aura. 
MERLIN It's done. A truce. We meet at the river. 
UTHER (disgusted) Talk. Lovers murmuring to each other... 
EXT. RIVER, FOREST - DAY 
Waiting on one bank of a small river that flows through the forest is a warlord, the Duke of Cornwall. He is flanked by his armored warriors. Lot of Lowthean prominent among them. They are battle-weary and bloodied, but they look ready to fight. Behind them is an army of lesser knights. 
To the opposite bank come Uther and Merlin, a much smaller force of knights, including Uryens, Lord of Gore, surrounding them. 
DUKE OF CORNWALL I spit on your truce, Uther. If you want peace, throw down your swords. 
Uther and the Duke of Cornwall glare at each other in silence across the river. Uther strains forward, burning with anger; but Merlin restrains him. 
UTHER I should butcher all and every one of them. Merlin, what is this wagging of tongues? 
MERLIN Just show the sword. 
Uther unsheathes his mighty sword, and brandishes it in the air high over his head. The blade hums disquietingly and leaves a lingering electric hue upon the air. The marvel instills dread in all present. 
MERLIN (waxing eloquent) Behold the sword of power, Excalibur. Before Uther, it belonged to Lud, before Lud, to Beowulf, before Beowulf to Baldur the Good, before Baldur to Thor himself and that was when the world was young and there were more than seven colors in the rainbow. (and in an aside to Uther) Speak the words. 
UTHER (bellowing) One land, one king! That is my peace! 
The Duke of Cornwall looks around nervously as some of his knights fall to their knees in awe. 
DUKE OF CORNWALL Lord Uther, if I yield to the sword of power, what will you yield? 
UTHER Me, yield!? 
Merlin urges Uther hard. 
MERLIN (a whisper) He has given. Now you must. 
The two knights glare at each other, rage contending with anger. 
UTHER The land from here to the sea is yours if you will enforce the King's will. 
The enemies lock eyes and Merlin watches anxiously. 
DUKE OF CORNWALL Done!

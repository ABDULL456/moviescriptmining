His father wears a backbrace, his sister is weak and anemic. Only his sweet mother pays attention as he chatters excitedly. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBOY Turtles are of the order Testudine! \nMOTHER Really?    Testudine? \nBOY Yeah. And they're found on every continent! Except Antarptica! \nMOTHER Antarctica. Every continent, huh? \nBOY Uh-huh. The turtle shell has remained unchanged for two hundred million years! And there's all different kinds, Pelusio gabonensis, Phyrnops rufipes, Chitra indica, Dermochelys coriacea coriacea... EXT. SWAMP - LATE MORNING \nRanger, sheriff, and state police cars are parked near the van and Ford. Lots of sweating, uniformed people. The pillowcases have been emptied, the plants lie on black plastic sheets. A guy sprinkles water on them. Laroche enthusiastically helps Ranger Mike Owen catalogue the flowers. The Indians lean against their car, bored and smoking. Nirvana seeps tinnily out the car window. \nLAROCHE ... and what we have here, my friend, is ... thirteen Encyclia Cochleata... four Encyclia Tampensis -- MIKE OWEN I'm sorry, Encyclia what? \nLAROCHE (pointing to each) Coch-le-ata. Tem-pen-sis. (checks Owen's spelling) Okay, let's see, twenty-two Epidendrum Nocturnum. A very good haul. Two Catopsi Floribunda. Three Polyrrhiza Lindenii, the ghost orchid. What I really came for. These sweeties grow nowhere in the U.S. except in your swamp. \nMIKE OWEN That true? Boy, you really know your plants, Mr. Laroche. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLAROCHE Yeah. I do. I'm one of the world's foremost experts. But that'll all be revealed at the hearing. \nINT. EMPTY DINING ROOM - DAY \nKaufman sits at a card table, picking at a salad and reading an orchid book. Donald lies on the floor, chomping a hoagie and reading a copy of Story by Robert McKee. \nKAUFMAN (V.O.) The Orchidaceae is a large, ancient family of perennial plants with... \nKaufman, bored, looks over at Donald, whose cheeks are stuffed with food. \nDONALD (V.O.) The most memorable, fascinating characters tend to have not only a conscious but an unconscious desire. Although these characters are unaware of their subconscious need... \nKAUFMAN Maybe you should watch what you eat, Donald. Did you ever consider maybe you're a bit fat? Does it ever occur to you, you kind of represent me in the world? That people look at you and think, he's Charlie's twin, therefore that's what Charlie must look like? \nDONALD By the way, mom's paying for the seminar. \nKAUFMAN Did you even hear what I said? \nDONALD Yeah. Anyway. I pitched mom my screenplay -- \nKAUFMAN Jesus, don't say \"pitch.\" \nDONALD Sorry. Anyway, she loved my... telling of my story to her. She said it's like \"Silence of the Lambs\" meets \"Psycho.\" \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nKAUFMAN Hey, maybe you and mom could collaborate. I hear she's really good with structure. \nDONALD You think you're so superior, Charles. Well, I'm really gonna write this. And you'll see. And, and... you suck, okay? \nThe two glare at each other.   They go back to their books. \nKAUFMAN (V.O.) Florida is a landscape of transition... \nDONALD (V.O.) Do not proliferate characters; do not multiply locations. Rather than hopscotching through time, space, and people, discipline yourself to a reasonably contained cast and world... \nINT. RENTAL CAR - DAY \nOrlean drives on State Road 29, past prefab housing, into swampland. She talks to us. \nORLEAN Florida is a landscape of transition and mutation, a hybrid of unruliness and orderliness, nature and artifice. \nShe brushes a wisp of hair from her face and tucks it behind her small, pretty ear. We linger on the ear, which grows pink with sunlight. Orlean catches us and smiles shyly. \nINT. EMPTY BEDROOM - DAY \nKaufman traces a stubby, nail-bitten finger along State Road 29 along a Florida road map. He turns to his typewriter, and types in a clumsy hunt-and-peck style. \nKAUFMAN (V.O.) We open on State Road 29. A lonely stretch of road cutting through untamed swampland. Suddenly a beat-up white van barrels around a curve. It's driver: a skinny man with no front teeth... \nINT. COURT ROOM - DAY \nThe proceedings are in progress.   Orlean hurries in, sits in the back. \n(CONTINUED) \n", "test1_true": "Laroche, in a Miami Hurricanes cap, wrap-around Mylar sunglasses, and a Hawaiian shirt, is on the stand. Alan Lerner, the tribe's lawyer, questions him. \nLERNER Finally, Mr. Laroche, what is your experience in the area of horticulture? \nLAROCHE Okay, I've been a professional horticulturist for twelve years. I've owned a plant nursery of my own which was destroyed by the hurricane. I'm a professional plant lecturer. I've given at least sixty lectures on the cultivation of plants. I'm a published author, both in magazine and book form. I have extensive experience with orchids, and the asexual micropropagation of orchids under aseptic cultures.   This is laboratory work, not at all like your nursery work. (grins) I'm probably the smartest person I know. \nLERNER Thank you. \nLAROCHE You're very welcome. \nINT. BARNES AND NOBLE - DAY \nAs she rings up his books, Kaufman admires the cashier's flower tattoo. She catches him and smiles with red, wet, pierced lips. She unbuttons her blouse and shows him a breast with a heart tattoo. A sweet heartbeat turns to knocking. \nINT. EMPTY BEDROOM - NIGHT \nKaufman, in bed masturbating, looks up at the closed door. \nKAUFMAN What?! \nThe door opens.    Donald stands there for a moment in shadows. \nDONALD Look, you wanna hear my pitch, or what? \nKAUFMAN Go away.    God damn it. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDONALD (lost) Y'know, I'm just trying to do something. \nKaufman squints at his brother, sits up, waits. \nDONALD (CONT'D) Hey, thanks a lot, man. Cool. (flicks on light, then in pitch mode:) Okay, there's this serial killer, right -- \nKaufman groans, lies down, pulls the covers over his face. \nDONALD (CONT'D) No, wait. See, he's being hunted by a cop. And he's taunting the cop, right? Sending clues who his next victim is. He's already holding her hostage in his creepy basement. So the cop gets obsessed with figuring out her identity, and in the process he falls in love with her. Even though he's never even met her. She becomes, like, the unattainable, like the Holy Grail. \nKAUFMAN (through a blanket) It's a little obvious, don't you think? \nDONALD Okay, but there's a twist. See, we find out the killer suffers from multiple personality disorder. Okay? See, he's really also the cop and the girl. All of them. It's all him! Isn't that crazy? \nDonald waits, proud.    Kaufman pulls off the covers. \nKAUFMAN Look, the only idea more overused than serial killers, is multiple personality. On top of that you explore the notion that cop and criminal are really two aspects of the same person. See every cop movie ever made for other examples of this. \nDONALD Mom called it psychologically taut. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nKAUFMAN The other thing is, there's no way to write this. Did you consider that? I mean, how exactly would you show a character holding himself hostage? \nDONALD Trick photography? \nKAUFMAN Okay, that's not what I'm asking. What I'm asking is in the reality of this movie, if there's only one character, right?... Okay? How could you... What exactly would the scene... How... \nDonald waits blankly.   Kaufman gives up, gets out of bed, dresses. \nKAUFMAN (cont'd) I agree with mom. Very taut. Sybil meets.. I dunno, something very taut. \nKaufman exits. \nEXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY \nOrlean exits the courthouse and watches Laroche in a huddle with Lerner, Vinson, and Buster Baxley, vice-president of the tribe's business operations. They're all smoking intently. \nLAROCHE They're gonna fucking crucify me. \nBAXLEY I'll go into the Fakahatchee with a chainsaw. I swear to God. \nLERNER Buster, for crying out loud, I reminded her the Indians used to own Fakahatchee. Look, we'll deal with all this at trial. \nBuster waves a dismissive hand at Lerner, walks away. Vinson shrugs, stubs his cigarette, follows Buster. Lerner and Laroche stand there a moment. Lerner walks off. Laroche cracks his neck. A charmingly shy Orlean approaches. \nORLEAN Mr. Laroche? \nOrlean smiles, apologetic for the intrusion. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nORLEAN (CONT'D) My name's Susan Orlean, I'm a writer for the New Yorker. It's a maga -- \n", "test1_id": 1692, "test2_input": "The boy nods his head solemnly. \nINT. VAN - DAY \nLaroche drives, solemnly nodding his head. Orlean studies him for a moment, her sad eyes wet and glistening. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nORLEAN Wow, that's some story. So how many turtles did you end up collecting? \nLAROCHE (matter-of-fact) Oh, I lost interest right after that. \nORLEAN Oh. \nLAROCHE I dropped turtles when I fell in love with Ice Age fossils. Learned everything about them. Collected the shit out of 'em. Fossils were the only thing made any sense to me in this fucking world. Y'know? \nThey drive in silence.    Orlean watches a flying heron. \nLAROCHE (CONT'D) Then fossils were over when I found lapidary, which I just adored. \nORLEAN Okay, now what is lap -- \nLAROCHE Ditched lapidary for resilvering old mirrors. Did that with my mom for a while. We had the largest collection of 19th Century Dutch mirrors on the planet. Perhaps you read about us. Mirror World October '88? I have a copy somewhere... \nLaroche fishes through junk as he drives. \nORLEAN So, did you ever miss the turtles? The only thing that made you ten year old life worth living? \nLAROCHE I'll tell you a story. I once fell deeply, profoundly in love with tropical fish. I had sixty goddamn fish tanks in my house. I'd skin-dive to find just the right ones. Anisotremus virginicus, Holacanthus ciliaris, Chaetodon capistratus. You name it. Then one day I say, fuck fish. I renounce fish. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) LAROCHE (cont'd) I vow to never set foot in the ocean again, that's how much fuck fish. That was seventeen years ago and I have never since stuck so much as a toe into that ocean. And I love the ocean! \nORLEAN (beat) But why? \nLAROCHE (shrugs) Done with fish. \nINT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY \nKaufman sits in silence across from his female therapist. \nTHERAPIST So -- \nKAUFMAN I'm still obsessed with that girl. \nTHERAPIST The Burger King girl? Dimples and sparkly eyes? \nKAUFMAN California Pizza Kitchen. \nTHERAPIST Oh.    Red hair and nice?   Likes orchids? \nKAUFMAN Yeah. She's really nice. I feel pretty certain she likes me maybe. \nTHERAPIST So do you think you'll talk to this one? \nINT. CALIFORNIA PIZZA KITCHEN - DAY \nKaufman, hair combed, sits nervously in a booth, watching Alice. He tenses as she comes up to him. She smiles warmly. \nKAUFMAN Hi! \nALICE Hey!    Some key lime pie for ya today? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nKAUFMAN (thrilled she remembered) Okay, yeah! That sounds great!     Yeah! \nALICE I'll pick you out an extra large piece. Preferred customer. \nShe winks at him.   He's so in love. \nKAUFMAN Thank you.     That's really sweet of you. \nALICE Still reading about orchids, I hope. \nKAUFMAN Yes, I am, in fact!    Beautiful flowers. \nALICE A friend of mine has a pretty little pink one, grows right on a tree branch. \nKAUFMAN That's what's called an epiphyte. \nALICE (pointing at him excitedly) Right! Boy, you know your stuff, huh? \nKAUFMAN Not really. I'm just learning. Epiphytes grow on trees, but they're not parasites. They get all their nourishment from the air and rain. \n", "test2_true": "Awkward pause. \nKAUFMAN There are more than thirty thousand kinds of orchids in the world. \nALICE Wow, that's a lot, huh? Okay, then, so I'll be right back with a nice big slice of key lime pie for my orchid expert. \nHe beams.    She smiles and turns to leave.    Kaufman blurts: \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nKAUFMAN But, so, anyway, I was also wondering... \nAlice turns back, still smiling. \nKAUFMAN (cont'd) I'm going up to this orchid show on Saturday in Santa Barbara and I -- \nAlice's smile slips away.    Her warmth dissipates. \nALICE Oh, um, well -- \nKAUFMAN I'm sorry.     I apologize.   I'm sorry. \nALICE (nodding) So I'll be right back with your pie then. \nHe nods, watches Alice walk away and say something to another waitress. The other waitress looks over at him. He sweats. \nKAUFMAN (V.O.) I am fat.     I am old. I am repulsive. \nThe other waitress brings his pie.      He smiles a thank you. \nINT. NEW YORK APARTMENT - MORNING \nOrlean sits at her desk and talks to us. \nORLEAN There are more than thirty thousand known orchid species. One species looks like a German shepherd... \nEXT. SANTA BARBARA ORCHID SHOW - DAY \nKaufman walks alone among the crowd of orchid enthusiasts, past a Santa Barbara Orchid Society sign. He tries to study the flowers. They are dull. He forces himself to look. \nORLEAN (V.O.) ... one looks like an onion, one looks like an octopus. One looks... \nKaufman finds his attention drifting from orchids to women: all different shapes, colors, personalities, some in subtle clothing, some in garish clothing, all glowing. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nORLEAN (V.O.) (cont'd) ... like a school teacher, one looks like a gymnast, one looks like a Midwestern beauty queen, one looks like a New York intellectual with whom you'd do the Sunday Times crossword puzzle in bed. One looks like that girl in high school with creamy skin. One has eyes that dance. One has eyes that contain the sadness of the world. \nHe is sick with adoration for the women, who pay him no mind. \nORLEAN (V.O.) (cont'd) Nothing in science can account for the way some people feel about orchids. Those love them, love them madly. \nOne by one the women turn to the men they're with: a whisper in the ear, a shared look, an arm slipped through an arm. Kaufman is alone in this sea of people and flowers. \nEXT. SWAMP - DAY \nTeenaged Laroche and his mother tromp through the swamp. He carries a camera on a tripod. They spot a beautiful flower. Laroche is in awe. \nTEENAGED LAROCHE Encyclia tempensis. The butterfly. Laroche sets up the tripod, focuses on the flower.    His mother almost cries at the flower's beauty. \nMOTHER \"You will find something more in woods than in books. Trees and stones will teach you that which you can never learn from masters.\" Saint Bernard said that. \nTEENAGED LAROCHE That's pretty, ma. \nMOTHER Diane would've loved this flower, Johnny. \nTEENAGED LAROCHE Maybe somehow she can see it.    Y'know? \nMOTHER (beat) So... after this one how many, honey? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLaroche snaps the photo, makes a check in his notebook. \nTEENAGED LAROCHE Only one hundred and seventeen more. \nMOTHER And you have to have a photo of every single type of orchid in Florida? \nTEENAGED LAROCHE I have to, ma. You know that. \nShe smiles at him, rubs his neck. \n", "test2_id": 1693, "test3_input": "ORLEAN Isn't it curious? An orchid made me passionate about orchids. \nKAUFMAN You're throwing the truth away for a chemical confusion of your synapses -- \nORLEAN With this powder I am passionate about everything. (MORE) (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: ORLEAN (cont'd) I'm alive in a profound world now. It sizzles with beauty and horror and sex. Now writing is -- words are -- a way to remove yourself from passion. So I'm done with writing. John and I are making a fortune with this extract. It's big in the Miami club scene. We call it \"Passion.\" (giggles) Isn't that cute? \nUp ahead, Laroche turns off the road at the Fakahatchee sign. \nORLEAN (cont'd) Follow him, please. \nEXT. JANES SCENIC DRIVE - A LITTLE WHILE LATER \nLaroche parks. Kaufman parks behind him. Orlean gestures with her gun for him to get out. As Kaufman comes around the car, he sees Donald on the floor of the back seat. Laroche emerges from his van with a flashlight and a rifle slung over his shoulder. Orlean prods Kaufman to follow him. Kaufman shakes and whimpers as they all step down into the thigh-high water. They slog through silently. Laroche stops. \nLAROCHE This spot looks good. (thinking aloud) Now how do we do this? Hit him in the head with a rock first? Keeping in mind we can only hit him once and only with as much force as would be created by him slipping and falling onto the rock. \nLaroche paces. Orlean finds a place to sit on a hammock. She unwraps a small square of paper and snorts something out of it. Kaufman shivers. Orlean's drugs kick in. \nORLEAN Holy Jesus. Holy...   Hey, baby, hey... \nOrlean trails off.    Laroche talks to the spaced out Orlean. \nLAROCHE Should we drown him, then hit him on the head? Uh-uh. A body bleeds different if the heart's stopped. These new forensic guys are very smart. We really have to know our corpses to stand a chance: rigor mortis, lividity, putrefecation, ocular changes. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: LAROCHE (cont'd) Maybe you think we hit him on the head and force water into his lungs after he's dead? No, darlin'. They'll know he didn't drown. See, contrary to popular belief, the lungs do not -- do not -- fill with water in a drowning. What happens is, choking causes an irritation of the mucous membranes. This creates a shitload of mucus in the windpipe. Efforts to breathe turn the mucus into a sticky foam which may or may not mix with vomit. It's the presence of this white foam that indicates drowning. There's a lot to be aware of, Susie. Shoeprints, hair, microscopic fibers. Tire tracks. They all tell a tale to today's forensic scientists. (to Kaufman) What do you think? You're a writer. How would you do it? What's a good way to kill somebody? \nKAUFMAN I don't write this kind of bullshit. \nLAROCHE Don't get all huffy, I was simply -- \nSuddenly Laroche gets whacked in the back, flies forward into the water. Orlean looks up, spaced.    She's confused by a second Kaufman standing there with a bag of potting soil. Donald grabs Kaufman and they run back toward the road. \nLaroche pulls himself from the water. \nLAROCHE (cont'd) Fuck! \nORLEAN (receptively) Yeah, let's, baby. \nShe staggers moonily toward Laroche.      He pushes her away. \nLAROCHE Not now. We got to kill that guy. And now I guess that other guy as well. \nORLEAN (disappointed) Ohhh. \nINT. CAR - CONTINUOUS \nKaufman and Donald speed along the swamp road. \nKAUFMAN For Christ's sake, why didn't you do something while we were in the car? \nDONALD My back had seized.     I couldn't move. \nLaroche's van pulls close to them and rams them from behind. \nKAUFMAN Shit! \nIt rams them again, this time sending them down into the swamp. The van stops. Donald tries to back the car onto the road; the wheels just spin. Laroche steps out of the van. \nDONALD We've gotta ditch this thing. \nKAUFMAN (hysterical) It's a rental! It's a rental! \nDONALD Now! \nKaufman and Donald climb from the car, make their way deep into the swamp. Laroche follows them in on foot, dragging Orlean, who is admiring all the plant life. \nORLEAN That's beautiful! What's that, Johnny? What's that one called? I just so want to fuck that flower, don't you? \nLAROCHE Asclepias lanceolata. Red milkweed. Extremely fuckable. But we don't have time. \nLaroche shoots at the brothers.    Kaufman whines. \nLAROCHE (to Orlean) What's his name? \nORLEAN Um, y'know... Charlie or something. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLAROCHE Charlie! Listen, let's talk! This pie is big enough for four people! (to Orlean) Why are there two of him? \nOrlean shrugs. \nORLEAN Identical twigs? (laughs crazily) Did I say twigs? I meant twins. \n", "test3_true": "LAROCHE Cladium jamaicense, guys. Sawgrass. You want to watch out for that. That's some evil shit. Cut you up. \nKAUFMAN Fuck you, Laroche! \nLAROCHE Just tryin' to be helpful. Walk with us and I'll be sure you avoid all the pitfalls. I know these swamps forwards and backwards. There's alligators and poisonous snakes, fellas. Wild hogs. \nKaufman and Donald are stopped by a large body of water. Nowhere to go. Laroche and Orlean close in. The brothers run along the periphery of the lake. Donald stops. \nDONALD Wait.   Do you hear something? \nKaufman stops, hears a distant galloping and squealing. \nKAUFMAN Donald, that sounds bad. \nThe brothers run in the opposite direction. The galloping gets louder. It's wild pigs. Donald spots an airboat on the shore. They jump onto it, search hysterically in the dark for bow to start it.   The pigs get closer. Laroche and Orlean get closer. Donald finds a button, presses it, the engine starts. They pull away from the shore just as the pigs catch up. One pig leaps on board, squealing. Kaufman kicks at it as Donald attempts to steer the boat. A kick connects and the pig flies into the water. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nLaroche stands at the shoreline and fires his rifle. It nicks the boat. Donald looks back and the boat heads for a cypress stand. \nKAUFMAN Watch out, watch out, watch out! \nDonald gets the boat back on course. Laroche and Orlean have been left far behind. Donald slows the boat. \nDONALD I think we're okay. \nSuddenly Laroche's van comes tearing around a corner and speeds along the road at the water's edge. Orlean shoots at the boat from the van window. \nDONALD (cont'd) Hold on! \nDonald speeds up. The van keeps up, the shooting continues. Bullets whiz. Kaufman puts his head in his hands. A bullet hits the airboat's gas tank. It explodes in a ball of flame, illuminating the whole swamp. Kaufman and Donald are thrown, along with flaming pieces of debris. Donald treads water, looks all around for Kaufman. \nDONALD (cont'd) Charles?!    Charles?! Where are you? \nUnderwater. A dazed Kaufman tries to get his bearings. The murky lake bottom is lit a dim orange by the fire on the surface. An alligator appears. Kaufman panics, surfaces. \nOn the surface, Donald spots Kaufman pop out of the water, then get jerked back down. Donald dives. \nUnderwater. The alligator violently shakes Kaufman by the leg. Donald surfaces, comes back down with a broken propeller blade. He hacks the alligator's head off, grabs Kaufman, and brings him to the surface. \nDonald swims to shore with Kaufman in tow.    Another shot is fired. It skims the water near Kaufman. \nKAUFMAN Fuck!   Fuck, Donald, we're dead. \nDONALD We're okay. How's your leg? \nKAUFMAN I don't know. How's your back. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nDONALD It's fine.     My back is fine. \nLaroche and Orlean circle the lake in the van, shooting. \nMike Owen, in pajamas, leaves his house, jumps in his truck and agitatedly drives toward the noise and flames. \nDonald makes it to shore. He climbs out and is helping Kaufman, when he gets hit by a bullet and falls. \nKAUFMAN Donald! \nKaufman sloshes to shore. His right leg is bloody and mangled. He lifts his brother's head onto his lap. \nKAUFMAN You're gonna be okay. \nDONALD No.  But don't let them get you, too. (weak smile) You got a fucking awesome third act. \nKAUFMAN (crying) Donald, this is an awful, bizarre thing to say and an awful time to say it, but I'm sorry I didn't get to know you better. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. \nDONALD It's really... You've been really nice. \nKAUFMAN See, it's just I thought I knew you already. I thought you were me. And I hated me. \nDonald touches Kaufman's face. Kaufman looks at his brother. Donald's face glows radiantly in the fire light. \nDONALD Well, don't do that anymore.      Okay? \nKAUFMAN Okay. \nDonald dies. Kaufman screams heavenward. The van appears out of the bush, barreling for them. Kaufman rolls his brother out of the way, and limps off into a slough. The van follows, smashes into a tree, and comes to a halt. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (4) \n", "test3_id": 1694}

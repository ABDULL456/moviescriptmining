{"train": "ADAPTATION by \nCharlie Kaufman and Donald Kaufman \nadapted from the book \nTHE ORCHID THIEF \nby \nSusan Orlean \nSeptember 24, 1999 Second Draft \nEXT. ROCKY TERRAIN - DAY \nEndless barren landscape. No sign of life. The atmosphere is hazy, toxic-looking. Volcanoes erupt. Meteors bombard. Lightning strikes, concussing murky pools of water. Silence. \nINT. LARGE EMPTY LIVING ROOM - MORNING \nSUBTITLE: HOLLYWOOD, CA, FOUR BILLION AND FORTY YEARS LATER \nBeamed ceilings and ostentatious fireplace. A few birthday cards on the mantel, two of them identical: \"To Our Dear Son on His Fortieth Birthday.\" Charlie Kaufman, a fat, balding man in a purple sweater with tags still attached, paces the room. His incantational voice-over carpets the scene. \nKAUFMAN (V.O.) I am old. I am fat. I am bald. My toenails have turned strange. I am repulsive. How repulsive? I don't know for I suffer from a condition called Body Dysmorphic Disorder. I am fat, but am I as fat as I think? My therapist says no, but people lie. I believe others call me Fatty behind my back. Or Fatso. Or, facetiously, Slim. But I also believe this is simply my own perverted form of self-aggrandizement, that no one really talks about me at all. What possible interest is an old, bald, fat man to anyone? I am repulsive. I have never lived. I blame myself. I -- \nEXT. STATE ROAD 29 - DAWN \nA lonely two-lane highway cutting through swampland. \nBRITISH NARRATOR As natural selection works solely by and for the good of each being, all corporeal and mental endowments will tend to progress towards perfection. \nSuddenly, a beat-up white van barrels around a curve.   It's followed closely by an old green Ford. \nSUBTITLE: STATE ROAD 29, FLORIDA, FIVE YEARS EARLIER \nINT. WHITE VAN - CONTINUOUS \nJohn Laroche drives. He's a skinny man with no front teeth. The van is piled with bags of potting soil, gardening junk. A Writings of Charles Darwin audio cassette case is on the seat next to Laroche. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBRITISH NARRATOR It is interesting to contemplate an entangled bank, clothed with many plants of many kinds, with birds singing... \nLaroche tries to contemplate the plants and birds whizzing by. Almost too late, he spots the Fakahatchee Strand State Preserve sign and makes a squealing right onto the dirt road turn-off. The cassette case flies from the seat and half- buries itself in an open bag of peat. \nINT. GREEN FORD - CONTINUOUS \nNirvana blasts. Russell, Vinson, and Randy, three young Indian men, pass a joint and watch the erratic van ahead. \nRUSSELL Laroche is asleep at the wheel. \nRANDY Crazy White Man is now Drowsy White Man. \nThey share a stoned laugh. \nEXT. NEW YORK APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT \nSUBTITLE: NEW YORK, TWO YEARS LATER \nLate night street. The click-click of typing. We move slowly up the building to the only glowing window. \nORLEAN (O.S.) (wistful) John Laroche is a tall guy, skinny as a stick, pale-eyed, slouch-shouldered and sharply handsome despite the fact that he is missing all his front teeth. \nIn the window, lit by a single desk lamp, a woman types. \nINT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS \nWe glide over the desk piled with books about orchids, past a photo of Laroche tacked to an overwhelmed bulletin board, and come to rest on a woman typing. It's Susan Orlean: pale, delicate and blond. We lose ourselves in her melancholy beauty. She turns to the camera and talks to us. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nORLEAN Two years ago I went to Florida to meet Laroche after reading a small article about a white man and three Seminole men arrested with rare orchids they'd stolen out of a place called the... \nINT. RANGER'S TRUCK - MID-MORNING \nTony, a ranger, drives along a dirt road past the Fakahatchee Strand State Preserve sign and enters the swamp. He sees the white van and Ford parked ahead, spots a Seminole license plate on the Ford. He pulls over down the road, and whispers into his C.B. \nTONY We got a Seminole, or Seminoles, in the swamp. I'm on Janes Scenic Drive just east of Logging Road Twelve. I repeat, Indians in the swamp. \nTony waits for a response.   Nothing. \nTONY (cont'd) Indians in the swamp. \nNothing still.   Tony clears his throat into the radio. \nKAUFMAN I think it's great. Your photo in the trades and everything. Pretty cool. \nMARGARET Anyway.    Yeah. So what's up with you? \nKAUFMAN I'm considering jobs. Mostly crap. There's one you might like, about flowers. \nMARGARET Flowers?   Really? What is it? \nKAUFMAN They want me to do an adaptation of a book called The Orchid Thief. \nMARGARET Oh my God! You're kidding?    I read that! I loved that book! \nKaufman is thrilled; he's scored. Margaret pulls a copy of The Orchid Thief from her bookshelf. \nMARGARET (cont'd) See, see, see! I'm not lying to you! \nKAUFMAN I loved the book. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMARGARET Oh, Charlie, orchids are the most amazing flowers. So complex. \nMargaret plops onto the couch next to Kaufman. \nKAUFMAN I know.   They're really great. \nMARGARET You should take this job. Doesn't it sound exciting, to immerse yourself in a real subject and learn everything about it? Blake wrote about seeing heaven in a wild flower. And after you learn all this stuff, you can teach me! \nKAUFMAN (thrilled but controlled) That'd be fun. \nMARGARET God, they're such beautiful flowers.    And so sexy. Y'know? (whispering) Did you know that orchid means -- \nKAUFMAN Testicle.     I just read that. \nMARGARET (shrieks with delight) Testicle! Can you believe it! \nMargaret giggles happily.    Kaufman giggles weirdly. \nMARGARET (cont'd) I swear, it'd be fucking great for someone to have the testicles to make that book into a movie, man. Instead of this bullshit all the time. Something not about sex and violence and car chases and love stories, people learning profound lessons. Jesus, isn't nature enough? \nEXT. SWAMP - MORNING \nHot, dirty, miserable. Laroche leads the Indians through waist-high black water. He points out a turtle on a rock. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLAROCHE Pseudemys floridana. Did you fellas know you fellas believe the world rests on the back of a turtle? Not you fellas specifically. Although, maybe you fellas specifically. That I can't speak to. \nThe Indians ignore him. They trudge. Laroche spots something else, a dull green root wrapped around a tree. He stops, circles the tree. His eyes widen in reverent awe. \nLAROCHE (cont'd) Polyrrhiza Lindenii. A ghost. \nThe Indians come around. Laroche stares at a single beautiful, glowing white flower hanging from the tree.   He tenderly caresses the petals. Then, business-like: \nLAROCHE (cont'd) Cut it down, Russell. \nRussell pulls out a hacksaw, begins sawing through the tree. \nINT. RESTAURANT - MIDDAY \nKaufman still sweats as he talks to Valerie. \nKAUFMAN ...plus I love the idea of learning all about orchids. I really admire those guys who know everything about ants or fungus or whatever. I'd like to be more like that. See, I tend to write self- involved, self-loathing... even masturbatory stuff. VALERIE And it's wonderful, by the way. \nKAUFMAN Thanks. That's nice to hear. But I need to challenge myself as a writer. I've arrived at an age where I want to think about the world in a different way. \nVALERIE Adapting someone else's work is certainly an opportunity to think differently. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nKAUFMAN Yes. And I welcome the challenge of taking a small subject, like orchids, something that would never draw people into a theater and making that fascinating. I want to show people heaven in a wildflower. As Blake wrote. \nINT. PET STORE (1972) - DAY \nSUBTITLE: NORTH MIAMI, TWENTY-SIX YEARS EARLIER \nA serious ten year old boy walks from cage to aquarium, studying the inhabitants. He turns to his frumpy mother, who's been following at a respectful distance. \nBOY Any one at all, ma? \nShe nods sweetly. The boy returns to his search.        He stops at a small turtle in an aquarium. \nBOY (cont'd) I want this then. \nDONALD McKee is a former Fulbright scholar. Are you a former Fulbright scholar, Charles? \nINT. KITCHEN (1972) - EVENING \nThe young boy eats with his family. His father wears a backbrace, his sister is weak and anemic. Only his sweet mother pays attention as he chatters excitedly. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBOY Turtles are of the order Testudine! \nMOTHER Really?    Testudine? \nBOY Yeah. And they're found on every continent! Except Antarptica! \nMOTHER Antarctica. Every continent, huh? \nBOY Uh-huh. The turtle shell has remained unchanged for two hundred million years! And there's all different kinds, Pelusio gabonensis, Phyrnops rufipes, Chitra indica, Dermochelys coriacea coriacea... EXT. SWAMP - LATE MORNING \nRanger, sheriff, and state police cars are parked near the van and Ford. Lots of sweating, uniformed people. The pillowcases have been emptied, the plants lie on black plastic sheets. A guy sprinkles water on them. Laroche enthusiastically helps Ranger Mike Owen catalogue the flowers. The Indians lean against their car, bored and smoking. Nirvana seeps tinnily out the car window. \nLAROCHE ... and what we have here, my friend, is ... thirteen Encyclia Cochleata... four Encyclia Tampensis -- MIKE OWEN I'm sorry, Encyclia what? \nLAROCHE (pointing to each) Coch-le-ata. Tem-pen-sis. (checks Owen's spelling) Okay, let's see, twenty-two Epidendrum Nocturnum. A very good haul. Two Catopsi Floribunda. Three Polyrrhiza Lindenii, the ghost orchid. What I really came for. These sweeties grow nowhere in the U.S. except in your swamp. \nMIKE OWEN That true? Boy, you really know your plants, Mr. Laroche. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLAROCHE Yeah. I do. I'm one of the world's foremost experts. But that'll all be revealed at the hearing. \nINT. EMPTY DINING ROOM - DAY \nKaufman sits at a card table, picking at a salad and reading an orchid book. Donald lies on the floor, chomping a hoagie and reading a copy of Story by Robert McKee. \nKAUFMAN (V.O.) The Orchidaceae is a large, ancient family of perennial plants with... \nKaufman, bored, looks over at Donald, whose cheeks are stuffed with food. \nDONALD (V.O.) The most memorable, fascinating characters tend to have not only a conscious but an unconscious desire. Although these characters are unaware of their subconscious need... \nKAUFMAN Maybe you should watch what you eat, Donald. Did you ever consider maybe you're a bit fat? Does it ever occur to you, you kind of represent me in the world? That people look at you and think, he's Charlie's twin, therefore that's what Charlie must look like? \nDONALD By the way, mom's paying for the seminar. \nKAUFMAN Did you even hear what I said? \nDONALD Yeah. Anyway. I pitched mom my screenplay -- \nKAUFMAN Jesus, don't say \"pitch.\" \nDONALD Sorry. Anyway, she loved my... telling of my story to her. She said it's like \"Silence of the Lambs\" meets \"Psycho.\" \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nKAUFMAN Hey, maybe you and mom could collaborate. I hear she's really good with structure. \nDONALD You think you're so superior, Charles. Well, I'm really gonna write this. And you'll see. And, and... you suck, okay? \nThe two glare at each other.   They go back to their books. \nKAUFMAN (V.O.) Florida is a landscape of transition... \nDONALD (V.O.) Do not proliferate characters; do not multiply locations. Rather than hopscotching through time, space, and people, discipline yourself to a reasonably contained cast and world... \nINT. RENTAL CAR - DAY \nOrlean drives on State Road 29, past prefab housing, into swampland. She talks to us. \nORLEAN Florida is a landscape of transition and mutation, a hybrid of unruliness and orderliness, nature and artifice. \nShe brushes a wisp of hair from her face and tucks it behind her small, pretty ear. We linger on the ear, which grows pink with sunlight. Orlean catches us and smiles shyly. \nINT. EMPTY BEDROOM - DAY \nKaufman traces a stubby, nail-bitten finger along State Road 29 along a Florida road map. He turns to his typewriter, and types in a clumsy hunt-and-peck style. \nKAUFMAN (V.O.) We open on State Road 29. A lonely stretch of road cutting through untamed swampland. Suddenly a beat-up white van barrels around a curve. It's driver: a skinny man with no front teeth... \nINT. COURT ROOM - DAY \nThe proceedings are in progress.   Orlean hurries in, sits in the back. \n(CONTINUED) \nLAROCHE I'm familiar with the New Yorker. The New Yorker, yes, the New Yorker. Right? ORLEAN Right. So I was interested in doing a piece about your situation down here. \nLaroche scowls, smokes furiously, then, a test: \nLAROCHE Yeah? Put this in: I don't care what goes on here. I'm right, and I'll take this all the way to the Supreme Court. That judge can screw herself. \nOrlean scribbles on her pad. Laroche twists his head to see that she's writing \"Judge can screw herself.\" \nLAROCHE (cont'd) That for real would go in? \nOrlean nods.   Laroche smiles his toothless smile at Orlean. \nEXT. FIELD - MORNING \nMUSIC: lush, profound orchestral piece. \nA glorious orange, large-petalled orchid blooms in dramatic time-lapse. We slowly, lovingly circle the flower. \nSENSUOUS FEMALE NARRATOR The Orchidaceae is a large, ancient family of perennial plants with one fertile stamen and a three petalled flower. In most orchid species, one petal is enlarged into a lip and is the most conspicuous part of the flower. \nINT. CALIFORNIA PIZZA KITCHEN - DAY \nKaufman, in a booth, reads his orchid book, takes notes. \nKAUFMAN (V.O.) The Orchidaceae is a large, ancient... \nHe's bored, looks up, watches a waitress with glorious, orange hair, pouty lips, soulful eyes, and a voluptuous form turning slowly around, scanning her station. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nShe sees Kaufman, approaches, and smiles warmly down at him. Her badge reads: Alice, Arcadia, CA. Kaufman sweats. \nALICE So what looks good today? \nKAUFMAN Um. Hi. Thank you. The key lime pie, please. A small slice. I'm watching my... And a coffee, please. Skim milk. \nALICE (sees book) Orchids! I absolutely love orchids. \nHe goes blank. \nKAUFMAN Yes.   They're really great. \nHe flinches at his response.    A small awkward pause. \nALICE So, I'll be right back with your pie. \nShe smiles warmly again and leaves.    Kaufman is humiliated. \nEXT. ORCHID SHOW - DAY \nAlice the waitress and Kaufman walk hand-in-hand, inspecting sexy orchids together. She smiles warmly at him. \nALICE (I love you) I absolutely love orchids. \nINT. EMPTY ROOM - NIGHT \nKaufman finishes jerking off.   He lies lonely in the dark. \nINT. SUBURBAN BACKYARD - EVENING \nDark and muted. The seven year old girl is pushed on the swing by her father. From the air she sees her mother, tiny and lost, sitting across the yard smoking. \nEXT. HOTEL PARKING LOT - MORNING \nOrlean leans against a car and smokes. A tiny, lost figure. There's a honk. Orlean snaps out of her reverie to see Laroche screeching to a stop in his banged-up van. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nORLEAN (to camera) A few days after the hearing, Laroche took me to an orchid show in Miami. \nShe opens the passenger door. \nORLEAN (cont'd) Hi.   Thanks for picking -- \nLAROCHE I want you to know this van is a piece of shit. When I hit the jackpot, I'll buy myself an awesome car, maybe an Aurora. \nOrlean nods, climbs in, and tries to rearrage some of the junk on the front seat so she'll have a place to sit. \nLAROCHE (cont'd) Sit on top of that. You won't hurt it. \nShe situates herself on the seat.     Laroche lurches off. \nINT. VAN - DAY \nLaroche drives manically. Orlean watches the road and holds one hand against the dashboard. \nINT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY \nKaufman talks to the therapist. \nKAUFMAN I'm successful, right? I mean, I could say to a woman, I'm a screenwriter and she'd look at me differently. I could get laid. But I want someone to like me. For me. Y'know?    The way I like them. The way I'd do anything for that woman walking down the street. A million women walking down the street. I don't need to know what their jobs are. No one will ever love me like that. Like I love almost every woman I see. \nKaufman glances down at his therapist's breasts. He does it fast and unintentionally. He quickly shifts back to her face. His therapist wraps her shawl around her. \nINT. SHOW HALL - DAY \nCrowded with orchid lovers. Noisy chatter and calliope music. Elaborate displays include orchids on a ferris wheel, plastic clowns, and a booth that looks like a circus big top. \nLAROCHE Once you get the sickness, it takes over your life. I started out just photographing 'em. Now look at me. (dramatic pause) It'll happen to you. You'll see. \nORLEAN I don't think so.     I'm not prone to -- \nLaroche runs over to a flower. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLAROCHE Angraecum sesquipedale! Beauty! God! Darwin wrote about this one. Charles Darwin? Evolution guy? Hello? \nORLEAN (annoyed) I know who Darwin is. \nINT. EMPTY BEDROOM - NIGHT \nA depressed Kaufman fishes on his floor through an ever increasing pile of books: books about turtles, mirror resilvering, tropical fish, Hegel, etc. He picks up The Portable Darwin. The cover features a daguerreotype of Darwin. Kaufman paces and reads. \nINT. BOOK-LINED STUDY - NIGHT \nSUBTITLE: ENGLAND, ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE YEARS EARLIER \nSepia.   A sickly Darwin writes at his desk. \nDARWIN (V.O.) Therefore I should infer from analogy that probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from some one primordial form, into which life was first breathed. \nINT. EMPTY BEDROOM - NIGHT \nKaufman looks off into space, thinking. Silence. Suddenly, he grabs his mini-recorder and paces like a caged animal. \nKAUFMAN Okay, opening of movie. Four billion years ago. Life has not begun. Endless, barren terrain. Silence. Silence. \nEXT. SHOW HALL - DAY \nBlasting music.   Crowds.   Laroche shows the flower to Orlean. \nLAROCHE See that nectary all the way down there? Darwin hypothesized a moth with a nose twelve inches long to pollinate it. Everyone thought he was a loon. Then, sure enough, they found this moth with a twelve inch proboscis -- proboscis means nose, by the way -- and -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nORLEAN I know what proboscis means. \nLAROCHE Every one of these flowers has a specific relationship with the insect that pollinates it. There's an orchid that looks exactly like this particular insect. So the bug humps the flower and gets covered with its pollen. Thusly... \nLaroche mimes humping. \nORLEAN I get it. \nLAROCHE That's called pseudo-copulation. These flowers are smart! You gotta fall in love with them. Once you learn anything about orchids, you'll devote your life to learning everything about them. \nOrlean looks around: people sniffing flowers, feeling petals, staring deep into nectaries. People jabber passionately, people buy plants, people carry boxes of purchased plants. Orlean looks deeply into various flowers, at a dizzying array of colors and shapes, but remains detached. \nINT. APARTMENT - EARLY EVENING \nOrlean stares at photos of orchids on her bulletin board. She can't find a way in. She looks over at her husband reading. He smiles at her. She smiles back, but there's a terrible distance between them. She looks at us sadly. \nORLEAN I wanted to want something as much as people wanted these plants but it isn't part of my constitution. \nOrlean stares out the window at the empty street below.   A plastic bag dips and rises in the breeze. She inhales. \nORLEAN (cont'd) I suppose I do have one unembarrassed passion. (beat, looks back at us) I want to know how it feels to care about something passionately. \nEXT. SUBURBAN BACKYARD - NIGHT \nThe seven year old girl swings sadly by herself. From high up she sees her mother in a window at one end of the house, her father in a window at the other end. Both stare blankly in opposite directions. The swing completes it's arc and the girl descends, losing sight of her parents. \nINT. LARGE EMPTY LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nKaufman types furiously.   He's a sweaty mess. \nKAUFMAN (V.O.) ... then, after the entire history of life on the planet, in the last seconds of the montage, we see the whole of human history: tool-making, hunting, farming, war, lust, religion, self-consciousness. Yearning. Then, bam! cut to Susan Orlean writing a book about orchids. And the story begins. It's perfect! It's circular! It's everything! \nHe reads back what he's written. \nKAUFMAN (CONT'D) I'm an idiot. I'm fat. I hate my-- \nCUSTOMER #2 Johnny baby! \nLAROCHE Henry! Look at that Dracula vampira! It's gorgeous, man. \nOther customers gather around. \nCUSTOMER #2 Take me in to the Fakahatchee. Show me a ghost in bloom, and it's yours. \nLAROCHE Cool. \nCUSTOMER #3 Mr. Laroche, would you be able to -- \nLaroche picks up a ringing phone. Customer #3 continues to try and get his attention while he talks. \nLAROCHE Bromeliad Tree. Hey, Dora! Good, good. Well, sure, you gotta watch the temperature. Don't want an odontoglossum above seventy-five. Uh-huh, that should be fine. Yeah, damp it down. Oh, I'm doing well. She's fine, too. Sure... \nINT. VAN - NIGHT \nLaroche drives.    Orlean looks out at the dark night. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLAROCHE I believe some folks'd call me up to talk and just talk because they were lonely. \nOrlean looks at him.     After a long silence, Laroche muses: \nLAROCHE (cont'd) You know why I love plants? Because they're so mutable, so adaptable. Adaptation is such a profound process. (beat) Adaptation means you figure out how to survive in the world. People aren't too good at that sometimes. \nINT. AGENT'S OFFICE - DAY \nKaufman sits with his agent Jerry in a glass-walled office. \nKAUFMAN I don't know how to adapt this. I should've just stuck with my own stuff. I don't know why I thought I could -- \nJERRY See her?   I fucked her up the ass. \nJerry waves at a passing beauty. She waves back, keeps walking. Kaufman follows the girl's ass with his eyes. \nJERRY Just kidding. Hey, maybe I can help. What's the problem, buddy? \nKaufman looks at Jerry.     Will he accept help from an agent? \nKAUFMAN It's about flowers. \nJERRY It's not only about flowers. It's got that crazy plant nut guy. He's funny, right? \nKaufman pulls out a folded newspaper clipping, reads: \nKAUFMAN \"There is not nearly enough of him to fill a book,\" blah blah blah, so Orlean \"digresses in long passes\" blah blah blah \"no narrative really unites these passages.\" Blah blah blah blah blah. (looking up defiantly) (MORE) (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: KAUFMAN (cont'd) New York Times Book Review. I can't structure this. It's that sprawling New Yorker shit. \nJerry gets distracted by another sexy woman walking by. \nJERRY Oh man.   I'd fuck her up the ass. \nKAUFMAN There's no story. The book has no story. \nJERRY So make one up. The book's a jumping off point. No one in town can make up a crazy story like you. You're the king. \nKAUFMAN I didn't want to do that this time. It's someone else's material. I have a responsibility... Anyway, I wanted to grow as a writer, do something profound and simple. Show people how amazing flowers are. \nJERRY Are they amazing? \nKAUFMAN I don't know. I think they are. \nJERRY Look, what I tell a lot of guys is pick another film and use it as a model. I always thought this one could be like Apocalypse Now. The journalist spends the whole movie searching for the crazy plant nut guy -- what's his name? \nKAUFMAN John Laroche. \nJERRY She has to travel deep into the darkest swamps to find the mysterious \"Laroche.\" \nKAUFMAN I need you to get me out of this. \nJERRY Charlie, at the end of the day, I think it would be a terrible career move. \nMONTAGE \nJumble of images: Laroche talking, flowers, Indians, Orlean, the trial. The rapid fire click-click of typing. \nKAUFMAN (V.O.) Okay, okay, we open with Laroche. He's funny. Okay, he says, okay, he says, I love to mutate plants, he says, mutation is fun... Okay, we show flowers and, okay, we have to have the court case. Okay we show Laroche, okay, he says, I was mutated as baby, that's why I'm so smart...that's funny. Okay we open at the beginning of time...no, okay, we open with Laroche driving into the swamp... \nINT. EMPTY BEDROOM - NIGHT \nKaufman awakes with a start. Enthusiastic off-screen typing. Kaufman peers through the darkness at the books, papers coffee cups, and dirty plates all around. \nEXT. SWAMP - DAY \nThe phone rings. \nKAUFMAN (CONT'D) What? \nVALERIE (PHONE VOICE) Charlie?   It's Valerie. \nKAUFMAN Oh, hi.    Hi. Hey!   Hi! \nVALERIE (PHONE VOICE) Sorry to bug you. We were just talking about you, how excited we are. \nKAUFMAN Yeah, me too. \nVALERIE (PHONE VOICE) So it's coming along good? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nKAUFMAN It's good. It's complicated what I'm trying to do, but it's going very well. \nINT. ORLEAN'S APARTMENT - EVENING \nOrlean looks at a book called The Native Orchids of Florida. She comes to a photo of the ghost orchid glowing white on the page. Orlean's husband walks by with a cup of coffee, caresses her shoulder. She tenses slightly, smiles up at him apologetically. He smiles back sadly. She returns to the photo. A line of text catches her eye: \"Should one be lucky enough to see a flower all else will seem eclipsed.\" Orlean closes the book, sits there. She dials the phone. \nLAROCHE (PHONE VOICE) Yeah. \nORLEAN Hello, John? It's Susan. \nLAROCHE (PHONE VOICE) Susie-Q! \nORLEAN So I was thinking it'd be good for the article for me to go into the Fakahatchee to see a ghost. Would you take me? \nLAROCHE (PHONE VOICE) I'd love to, but, hey, I'm banned for the next six months. Goddamn crucified me. Get one of them monkey-suited rangers to take you. 'Course, they wouldn't be able to locate a ghost, if it climbed off a tree and shoved itself up their ass. Hey, put that in the article. \nINT. EMPTY BEDROOM - MORNING \nA hollow-eyed Kaufman is zipping up a suitcase. \nKAUFMAN (calling off-screen) Travelling into the Fakahatchee, Donald, is a perfect metaphor for writing. I'm stepping into the confusion of the unknown. I'm taking the big risk here. \nINT. EMPTY LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nDonald types cheerily on a lap-top computer at an ergonomic desk. Kaufman descends the stairs with his suitcase. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nKAUFMAN It's dark, dangerous, as dense as steel wool. I don't know if I'll come out alive, but if I do, I'll have something true to give the world. That's the difference between writing and aping some moron's \"principles.\" \nDonald looks up from his work.      He hasn't been listening. \nDONALD Hey, Charles, I'm thinking of putting a song in. Y'know like when characters sing pop songs in their pajamas and dance around. I thought it might be a nice way to break the tension. So, try to think of a song about split personality... \nINT. AIRPLANE - MORNING \nOrlean sits in her seat and addresses the camera. \nORLEAN You would have to want something very badly... \nINT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT \nKaufman reads The Orchid Thief. \nORLEAN (V.O.) ... to go looking for it in the Fakahatchee Strand. \nHe can't concentrate, closes the book and watches a stewardess tending to another passenger. \nINT. STUDIO APARTMENT - NIGHT \nKaufman fixes a salad in the kitchenette. The door opens and the stewardess enters dragging her luggage on a little cart. \nKAUFMAN Hey!    How was Denver? \nSTEWARDESS Oh, God, sweetie, I'm so glad to be home. \nShe kisses him, looks lovingly at him. \nSTEWARDESS (cont'd) Can I get you something to drink? \nINT. AIRPLANE BATHROOM - NIGHT \nKaufman finishes jerking off, stands, pulls up his pants, adjusts himself, and exits the bathroom. \nINT. AIRPLANE - CONTINUOUS \nKaufman steps out of the bathroom. The stewardess is there talking to another stewardess. She regards Kaufman blankly, then goes back to her conversation. He heads up the aisle. One of the stewardesses laughs. He tenses, takes his seat. \nINT. AIRPLANE - MORNING \nEXT. SWAMP - LATER \nMike Owen holds a handful of peat.   Kaufman looks at it. \nMIKE OWEN The oldest carbon dating they've done on any of the peat out here is fifty-seven hundred years. That's with carbon-14. (MORE) (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: MIKE OWEN (cont'd) That's in the right age where you can really date things accurately with carbon- 14, because it's half-life is fifty-five hundred years, so they must have found have of it gone and figured that... \nKAUFMAN Why isn't it wet? Orlean wrote about wading through black, corrosive water. She said it was the scariest experience of her life. And when I spoke to you on the phone, you said wear heavy boots, long pants and... \nMIKE OWEN There's usually water. We've been going through a bit of a drought. Say, have you seen that movie, Medicine Man? That's a good movie about protecting nature. It shows there could be something important in a rain forest we don't even know about, like a cure for cancer. \nKAUFMAN It's not even hot. I was expecting it to be awful. Sun beating down, wading through water, looking out for snakes, wild hogs. I was thinking it would be dramatic. Alligators. Something! \nMIKE OWEN The alligators are over by the lakes. The temperature's a blessing for us. This time of year can get uncomfortably hot. (pointing excitedly) Green anole. Florida's most common. \nKaufman looks down and sees a plain-looking little lizard hanging on a tree. Mike Owen jots it down in his notebook. \nMIKE OWEN (cont'd) I try to keep a log of sightings. \nINT. TRUCK - DAY \nMike Owen drives.    Kaufman stares out the window at boring trees. \nORLEAN (V.O.) It had been a hard day and I hadn't seen what I'd come to see. Maybe the ghost orchid was a ghost after all. (MORE) (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: ORLEAN (V.O.) (cont'd) There are certainly ghosts in the Fakahatchee -- ghosts of rangers who were murdered years ago by illegal plume hunters, and of loggers who were cut to pieces in fights, and for years there has been an apparition wandering the swamp, the Swamp Ape, which is said to be seven feet tall and seven hundred pounds and have the physique of a human, the posture of an ape, and the body odor of a skunk. \nEXT. RANGER SHACK - DAY \nKaufman and Owen stand by Kaufman's car. \nMIKE OWEN What Laroche did was wrong. Those flowers belong to all of us, all 250 million of us -- 250? I think it's up to 270 now -- And belonging to all of us means they belong to none of us. Nobody has a right to take them. Not me, not you, not John Laroche, not... \nKaufman is desperate for something else.    He blurts: \nKAUFMAN Listen, um, Susan Orlean wrote about a legendary creature called a Swamp Ape. Have you ever heard stories or -- \nMIKE OWEN (pissy) Tourist garbage! I don't know why people need to invent silly creatures to make nature fascinating. Isn't nature amazing enough? \nKAUFMAN (shamed) I just asked because she mentioned it. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nOrlean, still dirty from the swamp, holds a phone to her ear and talks to us. She has cute little dirt smudges on her face. \nORLEAN That night I called Laroche. \nORLEAN (into phone) I didn't see anything but bare roots. (MORE) (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: ORLEAN (cont'd) And I had this thought. Maybe the ghost orchid only blooms in the minds of people who've walked too long in the swamp. \nINT. ORLEAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nOrlean types. It's pouring and sheets of rain beat against her window. She glances at her husband, across the room reading a book. She sighs, continues typing. \nORLEAN (V.O.) What I didn't say to him is that life seemed to be filled with things that were just like the ghost orchid -- wonderful to imagine and easy to fall in love with but a little fantastic and fleeting and out of reach. \nINT. RENTAL CAR - EVENING \nKaufman drives down a Florida strip-malled highway. He passes a Barnes and Noble, a Burger King, a Starbucks. He parks in front of a California Pizza Kitchen. \nINT. CALIFORNIA PIZZA KITCHEN (FLORIDA) - EVENING \nKaufman watches the waitresses. One approaches his booth. Her name badge reads: Caryn, Tampa, FL. She smiles at Kaufman as she looks right through him. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nA morose Kaufman sits on the bed reading The Orchid Thief. \nKAUFMAN (V.O.) What I didn't say to him was that life seemed to be filled with things that were just like the ghost orchid -- wonderful to imagine and easy to fall in love with but a little fantastic and fleeting and out of reach. \nKaufman is deeply moved. He hi-lites the passage, then looks at the smiling photo of Orlean. He finds himself lost in it. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nOrlean, dirty from the swamp, is on the phone. \nLAROCHE (PHONE VOICE) (beat,clears throat) Jesus Christ, of course there are ghost orchids out there! I've stolen them! (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE) (cont'd) (beat, a cleared throat) You should have gone with me. \nCLOSE-UP OF MAGAZINE \nThe line: \"... then he cleared his throat and said: 'You should have gone with me.'\" VALERIE (O.C.) Beautifully written. A really unique piece. \nPULL BACK TO: \nCONTINUED: (2) \nLAROCHE We'll get into plant multiplication. Buy little ones, turn 'em into big ones, sell 'em at a profit. Simple plant multiplication for the masses. \nBAXLEY John, we're thinking maybe now's a good time for you to take a few weeks. \nLAROCHE I don't need a vacation, Buster. \nBAXLEY It's a good time.   Things are slow. \nLaroche stares at Buster.   Buster stares back. \nLAROCHE Y'know, the guys on my crew here, all they do is smoke weed all day. I been meaning to talk to you about that. So if it's a question of productivity -- \nINT. VAN - A FEW MINUTES LATER \nLaroche weaves through traffic.   Orlean holds on. \nLAROCHE They're gonna fire me. Goddamn politics. Crazy White Man's bad publicity. (pounds steering wheel) I can't believe I'm dealing with this! (pounds steering wheel) Like I could give a damn. If they fire me, I'll sue. I already did some legal research on this when I was doing the other shit. They can't fire me. And I ain't going to quit. \nMONTAGE \nGray skies. Kaufman drives his rental car: he looks at the Seminole Nursery, the Collier County Courthouse, Laroche's house. He drives through swampy terrain. He walks around at an orchid show, he attends a slide-show orchid lecture. It's all dull. He ends up sitting on a bench on an empty beach, staring out at the ocean. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY \nOrlean dials the phone.   It rings for a long time.    Finally: \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLAROCHE (PHONE VOICE) (groggy) Yeah? \nORLEAN John, it's Susan. (waits for response) Orlean. (waits) So, I was just wondering if you might be willing to talk some more. \nLAROCHE (PHONE VOICE) What about? \nOrlean rolls her eyes. \nORLEAN C'mon, John, I'm trying to put together a book. Don't just abandon me down here. \nLAROCHE I'm no longer interested in orchids. I'm pursuing other avenues. I apologize for any inconvenience this might cause you. \nOrlean is silent, taps her fingers on the bedside table. \nLAROCHE Thank you for your time. \nLaroche hangs up. Orlean sits there for a moment, flips through her list of orchid collector names. \nEXT. EMPTY BEACH - DAY \nKaufman sits on the bench, looking out at the ocean. An attractive, spandexed couple skate by, chatting in German. He watches the woman, hoping for a look, for something. He doesn't get it. They're gone. A tan older man sits on the bench, lights a cigarette. Kaufman continues to look at the ocean, even though he feels the guy's eyes on him. He doesn't want to engage. \nGUY ON BENCH We could use the rain, huh? \nKaufman nods, looking at the ocean.      Pause. \nGUY ON BENCH (cont'd) So you from around here? \nKaufman shakes his head \"no.\"   Pause. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGUY ON BENCH (cont'd) So where then? \nKAUFMAN California. \nGUY ON BENCH (excitedly) Yeah? I'm moving to L.A. I just wrote a screenplay. I sent it to a lot of agents. But if they turn me down, I'll go there and market it myself. I used to be in marketing in New York, so I know exactly how to sell this thing. (beat) Where's a nice place to live if you don't have a car? \nKAUFMAN You kind of need a car. I guess West Hollywood would be okay. \nGUY ON BENCH So you recommend West Hollywood then. \nKAUFMAN I'm not recommending it. \nPause. \nGUY ON BENCH I moved down here for a change, and I wrote the screenplay. Just like that. It's a great idea. \nThe old guy waits for a response.    He gets none. \nGUY ON BENCH (cont'd) It's about a mob guy, but it's not your regular mob story. There's a twist. A cop tells this mob guy's wife that the mob guy's cheating on her. But the truth is, the cop's lying because he wants her for himself. See, they used to go together in high school. (waits for response, then:) You know anything about screenplays? \nKaufman shakes his head. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: DONALD (cont'd) Oh, I made you a copy of McKee's Ten Commandments. I've posted one over both our work areas. \nINT. EMPTY BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nKaufman tears down MCKEE'S TEN COMMANDMENTS. Donald appears backlit in the doorway and seems oddly threatening. \nDONALD You shouldn't have done that. \nThey look at each other.    Donald breaks the tension, smiles. \nDONALD (cont'd) 'Cause it's extremely helpful. (lies down on floor) Hey, any sign of that Swamp Ape? \nKAUFMAN There is no Swamp Ape. It was invented for people who can't find the actual world fascinating. Y'know? \nDONALD Oh, okay. I didn't know that. Sorry. Hey, I got a song! \"Happy Together.\" I was worried about putting a song in a thriller, but Bob says, Casablanca, the greatest screenplay ever written, did exactly that. Mixed genres. \nKAUFMAN I need to go to bed, Donald.    I haven't slept in a week. \nDONALD Okay. \nDonald remains on the floor. \nMONTAGE SEQUENCE \nMishmash of images: alligators snapping, Laroche jabbering, Orlean typing, 19th century orchid poachers slogging, orchids blooming, Mike Owen lecturing. \nKAUFMAN (V.O.) ... so we open the swamp... okay, flashback to young Laroche had turtles... Okay, Susan says What Is Passion? And okay we open on a swamp and suddenly a white van comes tearing around... \nINT. EMPTY BEDROOM - NIGHT \nKaufman lies half-awake in bed, sweating, his eyes darting back and forth. He looks over at the clock. It's 3:32. \nKAUFMAN Damn it. \nDonald snores happily off-screen.   Kaufman switches on a lamp, pulls The Orchid Thief from his bag, flips through it. There are now many yellow hi-lited passages. He reads one. \nKAUFMAN (V.O.) There are too many ideas and things and people, too many directions to go. I was starting to believe the reason it matters to care passionately about something is that it whittles the world down to a more manageable size. \nKAUFMAN Such sweet, sad insights.   So true. \nKaufman flips to the glowing, smiling author photo. \nKAUFMAN And you're... I like looking at you. \nHe stares at the photo.   Its smile broadens.    It talks. \nORLEAN PHOTO I like looking at you, too.   Charlie. \nThe photo smiles warmly at him.   Kaufman begins to jerk-off. He closes his eyes. \nThen: Kaufman and Orlean are in his bed together, making love. She smiles at him throughout. They finish. \nThen: Kaufman is alone in bed, heaving. He looks at the still smiling photo. It somehow seems sleepy now. \nKAUFMAN I don't know how to do this. I'm afraid I'll disappoint you. You've written a beautiful book. I can't sleep. I'm losing my hair. I'm fat and repulsive -- \nORLEAN PHOTO Shhh. You're not. Whittle it down, focus on one thing in the story, find the thing you care passionately about and write about that. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nKaufman studies her delicate, melancholy face.      He's in love. \nORLEAN PHOTO (cont'd) (sweet, flirty smile) I figured there might be something... \nINT. KITCHEN - MORNING \nKaufman paces and talks animatedly into his mini-recorder. \nKAUFMAN We see Susan Orlean, delicate, fragile, beautiful, haunted by loneliness, typing at her desk. She looks at the camera and talks to us: \"John Laroche is a tall guy, skinny as a stick, pale-eyed, slouch- shouldered...\" \nDonald enters in his underwear, pours coffee. \nDONALD Morning. \nKAUFMAN Hey, hey. \nDONALD You seem chipper. \nKAUFMAN I'm good.     I have some new ideas. \nDONALD Cool. Me too. I'm putting in a chase sequence now. The killer flees on horseback with the girl. The cop is after them on a motorcycle. It's like a battle between motors and horses. \nKAUFMAN They're all still one person, right? \nDONALD Yeah, hey, that's the big pay-off. \nKAUFMAN (nice) Well, it sounds exciting. \nKAUFMAN Good.     I think really good now. \nVALERIE (PHONE VOICE) Great.    So I spoke to Susan yesterday. \nKAUFMAN (beat) Oh. Uh-huh, uh-huh. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nVALERIE (PHONE VOICE) I told her you were making terrific progress and she's really excited to read the script. \nSweat appears on Kaufman's brow. \nKAUFMAN Oh.   Good. \nVALERIE (PHONE VOICE) And she said she'd love to meet you. \nAll color drains from Kaufman's face. \nKAUFMAN Um, well, y'know, for me it's distracting to... or confusing to discuss what I'm exploring in the screenplay at this point... before I finish... it. So... \nVALERIE (PHONE VOICE) That's fair. I'll let her know. \nKAUFMAN Tell Susan I'd be very happy to meet her at a future date. As she sees fit. \nVALERIE (PHONE VOICE) Okay.   Good enough. \nKAUFMAN And tell her how much I love her book. Say I think she's such a great writer. \nVALERIE (cont'd) Will do.   Just keep us posted, Charlie. \nKAUFMAN Okay.   Nice talking to you.   Okay then. \nKaufman hangs up and looks at the photo of Orlean. It's still smiling, but not at him. It's not glowing. Maybe it's even smirking. Kaufman paces frantically, holding his stomach. Donald's off-screen typing grows louder. \nINT. EMPTY LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nDonald types at his desk on his computer.    Kaufman storms in. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nKAUFMAN You can sit here and pretend to be a writer, mocking the seriousness of what I do, like some kind of fucking funhouse mirror version of me! But let me tell you, you don't know what writing is! \nKaufman grabs his stomach, doubles over. \nINT. EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY \nKaufman is on a gurney and hooked up to an IV. He watches a slightly haggard woman with a bandaged head sitting in a small room across the hall. She glances over in his direction. He smiles. She looks through him. \nKAUFMAN (V.O.) She thinks I'm repulsive. \nHe lies there for a moment, then his eyes light up. \nINT. EMPTY BEDROOM - DAY \nKaufman types passionately on his computer. \nKAUFMAN (V.O.) Movie opens.: Charlie Kaufman, fat, old, bald, paces the room. His voice-over carpets the scene. \"I am old. I am fat. I am bald. My toenails have turned strange. I am repulsive. How repulsive? I don't know for I suffer from a condition called Body Dysmorphic Disorder.\" \nINT. AGENT'S OFFICE - DAY \nKaufman, looking tired and wild-eyed, sits with his agent. \nJERRY ... we need to talk about the orchid script. Valerie called yesterday. They're getting antsy. \nKAUFMAN I think I've got it on track now. \nJERRY Good.   She said you sounded weird. \nKAUFMAN No Hollywood bullshit. Just raw truth. Sometimes that takes a while to find. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJERRY Okay.    What's the time frame here? \nKAUFMAN It's goddamned honest, Jerry.   It's true. \nJERRY Oh, hey, my friend sent me this fucked- up internet thing. It's a girl taking a shit, but a trout comes out. You got e- mail yet? I'll send it to you. \nKAUFMAN This is more honest than anything anyone's ever done before in a movie, I'll tell you that. The only truth we can offer is the truth that's our own experience of the world. \"The great poet, in writing himself, writes his time.\" T.S. Eliot. \nJERRY It sounds good, buddy. But we do need to give Valerie a ballpark -- \nKAUFMAN I'm sick of their constant harassment! \nDONALD (cont'd) So would you show it to your agent? \nKaufman grabs Donald's script and throws it on his bed. \nDONALD (cont'd) Thanks. Also, I wanted to thank you for your idea. It was very helpful. I changed it a little. Now the killer cuts off body pieces and makes the victims eat them.   It's, like, I once saw this picture of a snake swallowing it's tail -- \nKaufman collapses, puts his head in his hands. \nKAUFMAN Ourobouros. \nDONALD I don't know what that means. \nKAUFMAN The snake is called Ourobouros. \nDONALD I don't think so. But it's cool for my killer to have this modus operandi. Because at the end when he forces the woman, who's really just him, to eat herself, he's also eating himself to death. \nKAUFMAN I'm insane. I'm Ourobouros. \nDONALD I don't know what that is. \nKAUFMAN I've written myself into my screenplay. It's eating itself. I'm eating myself. \nDONALD Oh.   That's kinda weird. \nKAUFMAN It's self-indulgent. It's narcissistic. It's solipsistic. It's pathetic. I'm pathetic. I'm fat and pathetic. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nDONALD I'm sure you had a good reason, Charles. You're an artist. \nKAUFMAN The reason is I'm too timid to speak to the woman who wrote the book. Because I'm pathetic. Because I have no idea how to write. Because I can't make flowers fascinating. Because I suck. \nDONALD Hey, am I in the script, too? \nKAUFMAN I'm going to New York. I'll meet her. That's it. That's what I have to do. \nDONALD Don't get mad at me for saying this, Charles, but Bob's got a seminar in New York this weekend. So if you're stuck -- \nKaufman shoots Donald a look. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER \nThe lights are off.   Orlean is in bed, sleeping fitfully. \nINT. PLANE - NIGHT \nKaufman reads Ann Landers's column in a paper dated July 4th. \nKAUFMAN (V.O.) Give yourself a reality check. Phoniness is transparent, and it is tiresome. Take pleasure in the beauty and wonders of nature. A flower is God's miracle. \nOut the window he sees colorful fireworks far down below, like small flowers blooming on the black earth. His eyes well with tears. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nKaufman sleeps fitfully. \nEXT. SWAMP - DAY \nOrlean walks through alone, panicked. All the vegetation is greener and crazier-looking than we've seen before. Things slither by in the water, brush up against her. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nShe tenses, steps into a sinkhole, flails, gets tangled in a vine, which wraps around her leg as she attempts to extricate herself. She falls face forward into the black water. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nOrlean snaps awake, bedcovers tangled around her legs. She heaves, looks at the clock. It's 3:30. She stares at the ceiling. She looks at the clock again. It's 3:30. She looks at the clock again. It's 4:10. She closes her eyes. She opens them, looks at the clock, the room is filled with murky water, the bed an island of dryness. An alligator pokes its nose out of the water, begins to climb onto the bed. Orlean jumps back, hits her head on the headboard. The room is back to normal. The clock reads 4:23. She closes her eyes. The alarm goes off. \nEXT. LAROCHE'S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING \nOrlean pulls up to the curb where Laroche stands, dressed in a short sleeve shirt, thin pants, and his Miami Hurricanes hat. He opens the door and climbs in. \nORLEAN Where are our supplies? \nLAROCHE Got everything I need right here. \nLaroche pulls a new pack of cigarettes out of his pocket. Orlean turns off the ignition and stares at the steering wheel. Laroche shrugs. \nLAROCHE (cont'd) Look, don't worry about it. We'll get crap at the Indian trading post on Alligator Alley. Hey, want me to drive? \nINT. CAR - A BIT LATER \nThe sun has come up strong. It looks hot. Laroche speeds along with one finger on the wheel, paying little attention to the road. The car veers onto the shoulder, he lazily corrects it. Orlean is tense. \nLAROCHE I remember one time when I was a kid, fifteen or so, my mother and I came to the Fakahatchee to look for a ghost to photograph. We walked for hours, through the most intense heat I'd ever felt.   We couldn't find one. I wanted to turn back. But my mom said, no. (MORE) \nLAROCHE We're not lost. \nEXT. NYC STREET - DAY \nOrlean window shops at a shoe store.   Kaufman takes notes. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nKAUFMAN (V.O.) Eyeing Stuart Weitzman pumps.    Okay. \nOrlean heads down the street. Kaufman follows. She enters the New Yorker building. Kaufman waits outside. \nEXT. SWAMP - DAY \nThe sun is hot. Laroche is twenty feet ahead of Orlean. She watches him march forward with great authority. She massages her eyebrows, leaving a residue of dirt on her face. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nKaufman reviews his notes.       He is sweaty and wild-eyed. \nKAUFMAN (V.O.) I have nothing. I am nothing.     I am fat. I am over. I am lost. \nEXT. SWAMP    - LATER \nThe sun is high. Orlean and Laroche sit on dry ground. She stares at him. Laroche won't look at her. He busies himself opening the backpack and pulling out food. Finally, Laroche speaks without looking up. \nLAROCHE We're not lost. \nLaroche takes out a cigarette, lights it. \nLAROCHE (cont'd) I'm just turned around a little. \nHe looks up at her, sees her staring at him. He pokes around on the ground for something, comes up with a straight twig. \nLAROCHE (cont'd) A sundial. I'll just set this up, wait a few minutes, and we'll be able to tell which way the sun is moving. We want to be heading southeast. \nLaroche sticks the twig into the ground, stares at it. \nLAROCHE (cont'd) This is no big deal. You should eat something. \nOrlean takes a cracker. This relaxes Laroche. He stretches his legs, knocks over the twig. Without looking at Orlean, he puts the twig back. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLAROCHE (cont'd) So do you collect anything? \nORLEAN (non-responsive) Not really. \nLAROCHE Well, y'know it's not really about collecting the thing, it's about -- \nORLEAN The sundial isn't working. \nLaroche looks down at it. \nLAROCHE It is so working. \nOrlean stares at the twig in the ground. She looks at Laroche. Laroche smiles sheepishly at Orlean. Rage and panic sweep across her face, her fists clench into balls. Her eyes become wild, some dark fantasy plays out in her brain. Laroche seems unaware. \nLAROCHE (cont'd) The thing about computers. The thing I like is that I'm immersed in it but it's not a living thing that's going to leave or die or something. I prefer having the minimum number of living things to worry about in my life. \nOrlean's anger softens.    She looks sadly at Laroche. \nORLEAN So, John... \nLAROCHE Okay, fuck the sundial. We'll just go straight and eventually we'll get there. \nThey rise. \nLAROCHE (cont'd) What I mean is we'll get somewhere. Out of here. I mean, logically, we have to get out as long as we walk straight. \nLaroche points them in a direction and they walk. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING \nKaufman is sleeping. It looks like it's been a rough night. The phone rings. He reaches for it. \nKAUFMAN Hello? \nJERRY (TELEPHONE VOICE) Hey, it's Jerry. I woke you? \nKAUFMAN No, it's okay. \nJERRY (TELEPHONE VOICE) How's it going? Has it been helpful to talk to the writer? What's her name? \nKAUFMAN Yeah.    Susan Orlean. \nMCKEE God fucking help you! It's flaccid, sloppy writing. Any idiot can write voice-over narration to explain the thoughts of a character. You must present the internal conflicts of your character in image, in symbol. Film is a medium of movement and image. \nKaufman looks around at people scribbling in notebooks. \"Any idiot...\" writes the guy on one side of him. \"Flaccid...\" writes the guy on the other side. \nMCKEE (cont'd) Okay, one hour for lunch. \nEXT. NYC STREET - A FEW MINUTES LATER \nStudents exit onto the street in small groups. Kaufman wanders by himself. His face is troubled. There is no sound. \nINT. AUDITORIUM - LATER \nMcKee lectures. Kaufman sits and listens. A copy of Aristotle's Poetics sits on his lap. The book features a bust of Aristotle on the cover. \nMCKEE You want your writing to be original. You want to have an original voice like Neil Simon or Nora Ephron. Well, let me tell you something, my friends. The key to originality is not eccentricity. \nA guy behind Kaufman gives an appreciative \"mmmm.\" \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. AUDITORIUM - LATER \nIt's late. The audience is tired, but still attentive. Now Kaufman takes serious notes. McKee, energetic as ever, wears his sweater tied around his shoulders. We stay firmly planted on his face as he talks and talks. \nMCKEE Long speechs are antithetical to the nature of cinema. The Greeks called it stykomythia -- the rapid exchange of ideas. A long speech in a script, say a page long, requires that the camera hold on the actor's face for a minute. Look at the second hand on your watch as it makes one complete rotation around the clock face and you'll get an idea of how intolerable that would be for an audience. The ontology of the screen is that it's always now and it's always action and it's always vivid. Life is rarely vivid. And that's an important point. We are not recreating life on the screen. Writers are not tape recorders. Have you ever eavesdropped on people talking in a coffee shop? Then you know how dull and tedious real conversation is. Real people are not interesting. There's not a person in this world -- and I include myself in this -- who would be interesting enough to take as is and put in a movie as a character. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. AUDITORIUM - LATER STILL \nMcKee faces the audience, holding a cup of coffee. \nMCKEE Someone asked me recently, Bob, do you think Michelle Pfeiffer is pretty. \nHe pauses theatrically, sips his coffee, then: \nMCKEE (cont'd) (deadpan) Michelle Pfeiffer is proof, my friends, that there's a fucking God. \nThe overtired audience breaks into uproarious laughter. Kaufman, with dark circles under his eyes, giggles a little. \nMCKEE (cont'd) Okay. That's it for tonight. Remember, there'll be a Q and A tomorrow morning before class starts. \nINT. HOTEL - NIGHT \nKaufman tosses and turns in bed. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. DREAM-LIKE FIELD - DAY \nThe daguerreotype Darwin, the Aristotle sculpture, the Hegel engraving, and the Orlean book jacket photo are alive and in the middle of brutal and bloody fist fight. \nINT. AUDITORIUM - MORNING \nKaufman, bleary-eyed, sits in the back.   McKee paces. \nMCKEE Anyone else? \nKaufman timidly raises his hand. \nMCKEE (cont'd) Yes? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nKAUFMAN You talked about Crisis as the ultimate decision a character makes, but what if a writer is attempting to create a story where nothing much happens, where people don't change, they don't have any epiphanies. They struggle and are frustrated and nothing is resolved. More a reflection of the real world -- \nMCKEE The real world? The real fucking world? First of all, if you write a screenplay without conflict or crisis, you'll bore your audience to tears. Secondly: Nothing happens in the real world? Are you out of your fucking mind? People are murdered every day! There's genocide and war and corruption! Every fucking day somewhere in the world somebody sacrifices his life to save someone else! Every fucking day someone somewhere makes a conscious decision to destroy someone else! People find love! People lose it, for Christ's sake! A child watches her mother beaten to death on the steps of a church! Someone goes hungry! Somebody else betrays his best friend for a woman! If you can't find that stuff in life, then you, my friend, don't know much about life! And why the fuck are you taking up my precious two hours with your movie? I don't have any use for it! I don't have any bloody use for it! \nKAUFMAN Okay, thanks. \nEXT. NYC STREET - NIGHT \nThe last of the students are filing out. Kaufman waits, leaning against the building. McKee emerges, carrying his brown leather bag. A shaky, tired Kaufman approaches him. \nKAUFMAN Mr. McKee? \nMCKEE Yes? \nKAUFMAN I'm the guy you yelled at this morning. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMCKEE (trying to recall) I need more. \nKAUFMAN I was the one who thought things didn't happen in life. \nDONALD (PHONE VOICE) I want to thank you for all your help. \nKAUFMAN I wasn't any help. \nDONALD (PHONE VOICE) C'mon, you let me stay in your place and your integrity inspired me to even try. \nKAUFMAN Well, look, I've been thinking, maybe you'd be interested in hanging out with me in New York for a few days. \nDONALD (PHONE VOICE) Oh my God, yes! I'm flattered! \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING \nDonald lies on his back on the floor intently reading the script. Kaufman paces. Donald finishes, is quiet. \nKAUFMAN So, like, what would you do? \nDONALD Script kind of makes fun of me, huh? \nKAUFMAN Sorry.   I was trying something.   I -- \nDONALD Hey, I don't mind.   It's funny. \nKAUFMAN Okay.    So, what would you do? \nDONALD You and me are so different, Charles. We're different talents. \nKAUFMAN I know. Just for fun. How would the great Donald end this script? \nDONALD (giggling) The great Donald. (serious) Well, I mean... do you need the whole court case? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nKAUFMAN Uh, it's what happened to Laroche.   It's kind of important. \nDONALD It's boring. No offense. A courtroom scene should be dramatic. Stick the ruling in a line of dialogue, maybe. \nKAUFMAN Um.   Okay. \nDONALD Too much about orchids. Get rid of it. Pare that stuff down to a minimum. Frankly, I'd focus more on the relationship between the brothers. I think that's the gold here. No one cares about orchids. \nKAUFMAN The book's about orchids. \nDONALD That's a problem. But don't let it ruin the movie. I mean, for example, use the orchids in a more dramatic way. Have some kind of bang-up, crazy action sequence in the swamp. Use the swamp better. It's a tremendous fictional world. A setting of great dramatic possibility. \nKAUFMAN That's true. But -- \nDONALD And put some twists in. Reveal some surprising thing about Laroche. God, what am I doing giving suggestions to you? I mean you're like a seasoned professional. You're an artist. \nKAUFMAN C'mon, you're the \"mill-five\" kid. \nDONALD (enjoying this) Shut up! (thinks) I love the Laroche porno web-site stuff. Is that real? Maybe make a bigger deal of that. I don't know. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nKAUFMAN I think it's real.   I haven't actually seen the site. \nDONALD It's sex, man! Incorporate it. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nThe front door opens and Kaufman enters. The lights are off, but the room is aglow with light from Donald's laptop computer. Kaufman sees a silhouetted Donald masturbating in front of the computer. Donald looks up, caught. \nDONALD Oh, hi, I was doing some research.   I found Laroche's site and... I'm embarrassed. \nKAUFMAN Jesus, Donald. \nKaufman passes Donald, glances at the grainy nude on the screen. He's stunned. It's Orlean smiling at him. \nDONALD What? She's kinda cute. You don't like her? I dunno, I think she's okay. It's not like I'm marrying her. \nKaufman shows Donald Orlean's book jacket photo. \nDONALD (cont'd) Oh, wow.   That's kind of a twist, huh? \nKAUFMAN Jesus.   Jesus! \nDONALD I think this is maybe a good thing for the script. Go ask her about this. \nKAUFMAN I'm not gonna ask her about this. \nDONALD You want me to? I don't mind. \nKAUFMAN No, I don't want you to. \nDONALD I could easily pretend I'm you. \nORLEAN (CONT'D) Johnny! Where are you going? \nKaufman makes a mad dash around the side of the house. Laroche cuts him off, grabs him, drags him into the house. \nINT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nLaroche throws Kaufman down into a chair. The chair slides across the floor, tips over. Orlean seems uninterested. She kisses Laroche's leg. \nLAROCHE Who the hell are you? \nKaufman notices Laroche has a set of beautiful, white teeth. \nKAUFMAN I just... nobody, I just -- \nLaroche shakes Orlean off his leg, kicks Kaufman in the gut. \nLAROCHE Who the fuck are you? \nKAUFMAN Um. I'm just. I was at the wrong house. I'm looking for the Johnson family. \nLAROCHE I got your Johnson family right here. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLaroche kicks Kaufman in the head.     Orlean kisses Laroche's back. Kaufman whimpers. \nORLEAN Honey, come back to bed. \nLAROCHE Who the hell sent you?      Rudy? \nKAUFMAN I'm not -- \nAgain Laroche kicks Kaufman in the head.      His scalp bleeds. \nKAUFMAN (cont'd) I'm the screenwriter. \nLAROCHE What the fuck does that mean? \nKAUFMAN I'm the guy adapting her book.      Her book about you. \nThis registers with Laroche. \nLAROCHE Jesus Fucking Christ. (then, trying to make sense) Why the fuck were you in my backyard? \nKAUFMAN I was, um, trying... I don't know. \nOrlean is unforgiving. \nORLEAN Who's the bloody fat guy? \nLAROCHE This is the fellow adapting your book for the movies, darling'. \nORLEAN (excited) Really? I wanted to meet -- (realizing) Oh. What does he know? \nKAUFMAN I don't know anything.   I swear. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nLAROCHE He knows about the greenhouse. (to Orlean) We can't have this appear on the silver screen. \nKAUFMAN It won't.    I don't even under -- \nORLEAN Johnny, I'm so tired now. \nOrlean lies down.   Laroche paces.   Donald peers, unseen, into the back window. \nLAROCHE He needs to be gotten rid of. \nKAUFMAN What?! \nDonald's eyes widen. Laroche paces. Orlean watches Laroche, fascinated by his every muscle movement. \nLAROCHE Small article in newspaper. \nOrlean snaps out of her muscle fixation, becomes fixated on his voice, his lips. \nLAROCHE (cont'd) Screenwriter doing research for movie about notorious orchid poacher was found drowned in the Fakahatchee after accidentally slipping and hitting his head on a rock. End of story. Is that credible from a journalistic standpoint? \nORLEAN Johnny, come lie on top of me. \nLAROCHE Focus, darling'. Is this credible? \nORLEAN (concentrates) Um, oh... this screenwriter was killed doing research in Jamaica a few years ago. (to Kaufman) Screenwriter, you have a car? \n(CONTINUED) \nSmoke pours from the grill and is lit by the headlights.         Out of the smoke, Laroche and Orlean appear with guns. They follow Kaufman into the swamp. \nMike Owen pulls next to the disabled van. He gets out, surveys the mess, sees bloody Donald on the ground. \nMIKE OWEN Jesus, that writer guy. \nOwen grabs his C.B., tries to radio for help. It's broken. He lifts Donald into the back of the truck and speeds off. \nKaufman limps through the dark water.       Laroche and Orlean follow the sound of his sloshing. \nORLEAN Water sounds so sparkly. Like lemon plastic jewels plopping onto a silver trampoline! Dontcha think? \nLAROCHE Darlin', please. \nORLEAN Can we fuck now, baby?    Fuck like lemons? \nOwen tears along the dirt road. Up ahead, Kaufman limps out of the swamp, into the truck's headlights. Owen is confused. He checks the back to see if Donald's body is still there and skids off the road into the swamp. Kaufman hurriedly limps over to the disabled truck. Owen climbs out. \nKAUFMAN You gotta help me.    You gotta help me. \nMIKE OWEN What the hell is going on here? \nKAUFMAN They're after me. They've got guns. They killed my brother. \nMIKE OWEN Who's got guns? What are you -- \nBefore Owen finishes, his truck is flipped over. Donald's body flies into the water. There, staring Kaufman and Owen down, is a giant man-like beast. It's repulsive, covered in algae-matted fur. \nMIKE OWEN (cont'd) Holy shit. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (5) \nThe two men turn and run. \nMIKE OWEN (cont'd) It's real!     I can't believe it, I never -- \nThe creature grabs Owen and snaps his neck like a toothpick. Kaufman screams as he runs, watches over his shoulder. He runs right into the arms of Orlean. \nORLEAN Hey, it's the screenwriter! \nKAUFMAN There's a thing back there!    You don't want to be here. \nKaufman, Orlean, and Laroche look back. Nothing there. \nLAROCHE You're right, I don't want to be here. I'm tired, let's get this over with. \nLaroche puts the gun to Kaufman's head. Kaufman tenses. Orlean studies Laroche's gun. Her nose is practically touching the barrel. \nORLEAN I love your gun, baby.    Can we trade? \nLAROCHE Stand back, sweetness. \nLaroche reaches for Orlean's arm to pull her away. Suddenly the creature grabs Laroche, pulls him into the swamp. \nLAROCHE (cont'd) Susie!   Susie! \nOrlean looks around. \nORLEAN Where'd Johnny go? \nLAROCHE (O.S.) Susie! \nOrlean, agitated and disoriented, fires repeatedly into the darkness. Something slumps forward in the water. Orlean steps cautiously over, keeping her gun on Kaufman. The creature is dead, so is Laroche. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (6) \nORLEAN (crying softly) Oh, Johnny. \nShe sits next to Laroche and pets his head.   Kaufman watches her. The sun is coming up. \nKAUFMAN I'd just stare at your picture, and you looked so sweet. I read your words and I thought you were smart and maybe lost and lonely like me. And the way you wrote about Laroche. You said he was handsome even though he had no front teeth -- \nORLEAN Oh, Johnny. Johnny's teeth.     Oh... \nKAUFMAN I figured you could look at me and see something, even with all my flaws you could look at me and find something, you could maybe someday write a description of me that would be nicer than the one I write day in and day out in my head. (hopefully) Would it be? \nKaufman takes Orlean's chin in his hand and directs her gaze to him. She stares at him for a long while, then: \nORLEAN You're really so wonderful. \nKAUFMAN Really? \nORLEAN So wonderful. I can see inside your soul. It glows with orange sadness. It's raining inside you. I want to run through your dripply dripples. It's so beautiful. I love you. I do. \nKaufman lets go of her face and sits on a rock. \n", "test1_input": "A man lies at the bottom of a cliff, clutching a flower. \nORLEAN (V.O.) Schroeder fell to his death. \nEXT.

JANES SCENIC DRIVE - MORNING \nTony steps out of his truck.   Laroche smiles warmly. \nTONY Morning. May I ask what you gentlemen have in those pillowcases? \nLAROCHE Yes, sir, you absolutely may. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLaroche goes back to directing the Indians.    Tony's confused. \nTONY Okay, I'm asking then. \nLAROCHE Oh, Okay then! Let's see... (peeking in bags) Five kinds of bromeliad, one peperomia, nine orchid varieties. About a hundred and thirty plants all told, which my colleagues have removed from the swamp. \nTONY You're aware that it's illegal to remove plants or animals from state owned land? \nLAROCHE And don't forget these plants are all endangered, sir. Every one of them. \nTONY Exactly. Well, that's exactly the issue. This is a state preserve. \nLAROCHE Yes, sir, it is. (afterthought) Oh, and my colleagues are all Seminole Indians. Did I mention that? You're familiar, I'm sure, with the State of Florida v. James E. Billie. Tony nods, even though he has no idea. \nLAROCHE (cont'd) So you know that even though Seminole Chief Billie killed a Florida panther, one of, what, forty in the entire world? \nLaroche looks to the Indians for confirmation.       They give it. \nLAROCHE (cont'd) The state couldn't successfully prosecute him. Because he's an Indian and it's his right. As repugnant as you or I as white conservationists might find his actions. \nTONY But -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nLAROCHE Not to mention the failed attempts on three separate occasions to prosecute Seminoles for poaching palm fronds, which, I believe, they use to thatch the roofs of their traditional chickee huts. \nLaroche again looks to the Indians for confirmation. \nRUSSELL He's right. That's exactly what we use them for. Chickee huts. \nTony looks at the Indians. \nRANDY Yeah. \nVINSON Yeah. \nRUSSELL Yeah. \nTONY Yeah, but I don't... I can't let you fellas go yet.

RENTAL CAR - DAY \nWe watch Orlean as she drives out of the Miami Airport parking lot, onto the freeway, past congestion and billboards. Her mournful face glows beautifully, dramatically with golden sunlight. She talks to us. \nORLEAN Nothing in Florida seems hard or permanent. The developed places are just little clearings in the jungle, but the jungle is unstoppably fertile, everything is always growing or expanding.

Kaufman watches as one whispers to the other. He thinks he hears the word \"Fatso.\" The girls giggle. \nINT. EMPTY HOUSE - A COUPLE OF MINUTES LATER \nKaufman passes a hall mirror, regards himself glumly, and climbs the stairs. \nKAUFMAN (V.O.) I am fat. I am repulsive.   I cannot bear my own reflection. \nAt the landing Kaufman comes upon Donald, his identical twin brother, on his back in pajama bottoms, opening a gift box. \nDONALD Did you open your present from mom yet? \nKAUFMAN What's with you? \nDONALD My back. \nKaufman nods vaguely, continues down the hall. Donald pulls a purple sweater from the box, calls after Kaufman. \nDONALD (cont'd) Hey, Charles, you'll be glad, I have a plan to get me out of your house pronto. \nKAUFMAN A job is a plan. Is your plan a job? \nDONALD (big build up) I'm gonna be a screenwriter!   Like you! \nKaufman doesn't respond, enters his bedroom. \nDONALD (cont'd) I know you think this is just one of my get-rich-quick schemes. But I'm doing it right this time. I'm taking a seminar! \nINT. EMPTY BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nKaufman lies face down on his mattress on the floor. \nDONALD (O.S.) It's only five hundred bucks! \nKAUFMAN (muffled by pillow) Screenwriting seminars are bullshit. \nKaufman pulls a copy of Variety, open to a photo of Margaret, from under his pillow. He gets lost in the picture. \nDONALD (O.S.) In theory I agree with you. But this one is highly regarded within the industry. \nKAUFMAN Donald, don't say \"industry.\" \nDonald, now in the sweater, appears on all fours in the doorway. Kaufman puts the paper back under his pillow. \nDONALD I'm sorry, I forgot. Charles, this guy knows screenwriting. People from all over come to study his method. I'll pay you back, man. As soon as I sell -- \nKAUFMAN Let me explain something to you. \nDONALD Yeah, okay. \nKAUFMAN Anybody who says he's got \"the answer\" is going to attract desperate people. Be it in the world of religion -- \nDONALD (indicating his back) I just need to lie down while you explain this to me. Sorry. I apologize. (lies down, stares at ceiling) Okay, go ahead. Sorry. Okay. Go. \nKAUFMAN There are no rules to follow, Donald, and anybody who says there are, is just -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDONALD Not rules, principles. McKee writes: \"A rule says, you must do it this way.   A principle says, this works... and has through all remembered time.\" \nKAUFMAN The script I'm starting, it's about flowers. No one's ever done a movie about flowers before. So, there're no guidelines, and that's good because -- \nDONALD What about Flowers for Algernon? \nKAUFMAN That's not about flowers.    And it's not a movie. \nDONALD Oh, okay, I never saw it.    Go ahead. \nKAUFMAN My point is, those teachers are dangerous if your goal is to do something new. And a writer should always have that goal. Writing is a journey into the unknown. It's not building a model airplane. \nDonald stares at the ceiling, fuming. Kaufman waits. Getting no no response, he pulls out his Hegel book and reads: \nKAUFMAN (V.O.)

So how many turtles did you end up collecting? \nLAROCHE (matter-of-fact) Oh, I lost interest right after that. \nORLEAN Oh. \nLAROCHE I dropped turtles when I fell in love with Ice Age fossils. Learned everything about them. Collected the shit out of 'em. Fossils were the only thing made any sense to me in this fucking world. Y'know? \nThey drive in silence.    Orlean watches a flying heron. \nLAROCHE (CONT'D) Then fossils were over when I found lapidary, which I just adored. \nORLEAN Okay, now what is lap -- \nLAROCHE Ditched lapidary for resilvering old mirrors. Did that with my mom for a while. We had the largest collection of 19th Century Dutch mirrors on the planet. Perhaps you read about us. Mirror World October '88? I have a copy somewhere... \nLaroche fishes through junk as he drives. \nORLEAN So, did you ever miss the turtles? The only thing that made you ten year old life worth living? \nLAROCHE I'll tell you a story. I once fell deeply, profoundly in love with tropical fish. I had sixty goddamn fish tanks in my house. I'd skin-dive to find just the right ones. Anisotremus virginicus, Holacanthus ciliaris, Chaetodon capistratus. You name it. Then one day I say, fuck fish. I renounce fish.

THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY \nKaufman sits in silence across from his female therapist. \nTHERAPIST So -- \nKAUFMAN I'm still obsessed with that girl. \nTHERAPIST The Burger King girl? Dimples and sparkly eyes? \nKAUFMAN California Pizza Kitchen. \nTHERAPIST Oh.    Red hair and nice?   Likes orchids? \nKAUFMAN Yeah. She's really nice. I feel pretty certain she likes me maybe. \nTHERAPIST So do you think you'll talk to this one? \nINT. CALIFORNIA PIZZA KITCHEN - DAY \nKaufman, hair combed, sits nervously in a booth, watching Alice.

That sounds great!     Yeah! \nALICE I'll pick you out an extra large piece. Preferred customer. \nShe winks at him.   He's so in love. \nKAUFMAN Thank you.     That's really sweet of you. \nALICE Still reading about orchids, I hope. \nKAUFMAN Yes, I am, in fact!    Beautiful flowers. \nALICE A friend of mine has a pretty little pink one, grows right on a tree branch. \nKAUFMAN That's what's called an epiphyte. \nALICE (pointing at him excitedly) Right!

Her warmth dissipates. \nALICE Oh, um, well -- \nKAUFMAN I'm sorry.     I apologize.   I'm sorry. \nALICE (nodding) So I'll be right back with your pie then. \nHe nods, watches Alice walk away and say something to another waitress. The other waitress looks over at him.

NEW YORK APARTMENT - MORNING \nOrlean sits at her desk and talks to us. \nORLEAN There are more than thirty thousand known orchid species. One species looks like a German shepherd... \nEXT. SANTA BARBARA ORCHID SHOW - DAY \nKaufman walks alone among the crowd of orchid enthusiasts, past a Santa Barbara Orchid Society sign. He tries to study the flowers. They are dull. He forces himself to look. \nORLEAN (V.O.) ... one looks like an onion, one looks like an octopus. One looks... \nKaufman finds his attention drifting from orchids to women: all different shapes, colors, personalities, some in subtle clothing, some in garish clothing, all glowing. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nORLEAN (V.O.) (cont'd) ... like a school teacher, one looks like a gymnast, one looks like a Midwestern beauty queen, one looks like a New York intellectual with whom you'd do the Sunday Times crossword puzzle in bed. One looks like that girl in high school with creamy skin. One has eyes that dance. One has eyes that contain the sadness of the world. \nHe is sick with adoration for the women, who pay him no mind. \nORLEAN (V.O.) (cont'd) Nothing in science can account for the way some people feel about orchids. Those love them, love them madly. \nOne by one the women turn to the men they're with: a whisper in the ear, a shared look, an arm slipped through an arm. Kaufman is alone in this sea of people and flowers. \nEXT. SWAMP - DAY \nTeenaged Laroche and his mother tromp through the swamp. He carries a camera on a tripod. They spot a beautiful flower. Laroche is in awe. \nTEENAGED LAROCHE Encyclia tempensis. The butterfly. Laroche sets up the tripod, focuses on the flower.    His mother almost cries at the flower's beauty. \nMOTHER \"You will find something more in woods than in books.

JANES SCENIC DRIVE - A LITTLE WHILE LATER \nLaroche parks. Kaufman parks behind him. Orlean gestures with her gun for him to get out. As Kaufman comes around the car, he sees Donald on the floor of the back seat. Laroche emerges from his van with a flashlight and a rifle slung over his shoulder. Orlean prods Kaufman to follow him. Kaufman shakes and whimpers as they all step down into the thigh-high water. They slog through silently. Laroche stops. \nLAROCHE This spot looks good. (thinking aloud) Now how do we do this? Hit him in the head with a rock first? Keeping in mind we can only hit him once and only with as much force as would be created by him slipping and falling onto the rock. \nLaroche paces. Orlean finds a place to sit on a hammock. She unwraps a small square of paper and snorts something out of it. Kaufman shivers. Orlean's drugs kick in. \nORLEAN Holy Jesus. Holy...   Hey, baby, hey... \nOrlean trails off.    Laroche talks to the spaced out Orlean. \nLAROCHE Should we drown him, then hit him on the head? Uh-uh. A body bleeds different if the heart's stopped. These new forensic guys are very smart. We really have to know our corpses to stand a chance: rigor mortis, lividity, putrefecation, ocular changes. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: LAROCHE (cont'd) Maybe you think we hit him on the head and force water into his lungs after he's dead? No, darlin'. They'll know he didn't drown. See, contrary to popular belief, the lungs do not -- do not -- fill with water in a drowning. What happens is, choking causes an irritation of the mucous membranes. This creates a shitload of mucus in the windpipe. Efforts to breathe turn the mucus into a sticky foam which may or may not mix with vomit. It's the presence of this white foam that indicates drowning. There's a lot to be aware of, Susie. Shoeprints, hair, microscopic fibers. Tire tracks. They all tell a tale to today's forensic scientists. (to Kaufman) What do you think? You're a writer. How would you do it? What's a good way to kill somebody? \nKAUFMAN I don't write this kind of bullshit. \nLAROCHE Don't get all huffy, I was simply -- \nSuddenly Laroche gets whacked in the back, flies forward into the water. Orlean looks up, spaced.    She's confused by a second Kaufman standing there with a bag of potting soil. Donald grabs Kaufman and they run back toward the road. \nLaroche pulls himself from the water. \nLAROCHE (cont'd) Fuck! \nORLEAN (receptively) Yeah, let's, baby. \nShe staggers moonily toward Laroche.      He pushes her away. \nLAROCHE Not now. We got to kill that guy. And now I guess that other guy as well. \nORLEAN (disappointed) Ohhh. \nINT. CAR - CONTINUOUS \nKaufman and Donald speed along the swamp road. \nKAUFMAN For Christ's sake, why didn't you do something while we were in the car? \nDONALD My back had seized.     I couldn't move. \nLaroche's van pulls close to them and rams them from behind. \nKAUFMAN Shit! \nIt rams them again, this time sending them down into the swamp. The van stops. Donald tries to back the car onto the road; the wheels just spin. Laroche steps out of the van. \nDONALD We've gotta ditch this thing. \nKAUFMAN (hysterical) It's a rental! It's a rental! \nDONALD Now! \nKaufman and Donald climb from the car, make their way deep into the swamp. Laroche follows them in on foot, dragging Orlean, who is admiring all the plant life. \nORLEAN That's beautiful! What's that, Johnny? What's that one called? I just so want to fuck that flower, don't you? \nLAROCHE Asclepias lanceolata. Red milkweed. Extremely fuckable. But we don't have time. \nLaroche shoots at the brothers.    Kaufman whines. \nLAROCHE (to Orlean) What's his name? \nORLEAN Um, y'know... Charlie or something. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLAROCHE Charlie! Listen, let's talk!

I meant twins. \n", "test3_true": "LAROCHE Cladium jamaicense, guys. Sawgrass. You want to watch out for that. That's some evil shit. Cut you up. \nKAUFMAN Fuck you, Laroche! \nLAROCHE Just tryin' to be helpful. Walk with us and I'll be sure you avoid all the pitfalls. I know these swamps forwards and backwards. There's alligators and poisonous snakes, fellas. Wild hogs. \nKaufman and Donald are stopped by a large body of water. Nowhere to go. Laroche and Orlean close in. The brothers run along the periphery of the lake. Donald stops. \nDONALD Wait.   Do you hear something? \nKaufman stops, hears a distant galloping and squealing. \nKAUFMAN Donald, that sounds bad. \nThe brothers run in the opposite direction. The galloping gets louder. It's wild pigs. Donald spots an airboat on the shore. They jump onto it, search hysterically in the dark for bow to start it.   The pigs get closer. Laroche and Orlean get closer. Donald finds a button, presses it, the engine starts. They pull away from the shore just as the pigs catch up. One pig leaps on board, squealing. Kaufman kicks at it as Donald attempts to steer the boat. A kick connects and the pig flies into the water. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nLaroche stands at the shoreline and fires his rifle. It nicks the boat. Donald looks back and the boat heads for a cypress stand. \nKAUFMAN Watch out, watch out, watch out! \nDonald gets the boat back on course. Laroche and Orlean have been left far behind. Donald slows the boat. \nDONALD I think we're okay. \nSuddenly Laroche's van comes tearing around a corner and speeds along the road at the water's edge. Orlean shoots at the boat from the van window. \nDONALD (cont'd) Hold on! \nDonald speeds up. The van keeps up, the shooting continues. Bullets whiz. Kaufman puts his head in his hands. A bullet hits the airboat's gas tank. It explodes in a ball of flame, illuminating the whole swamp. Kaufman and Donald are thrown, along with flaming pieces of debris. Donald treads water, looks all around for Kaufman. \nDONALD (cont'd) Charles?!    Charles?! Where are you? \nUnderwater. A dazed Kaufman tries to get his bearings. The murky lake bottom is lit a dim orange by the fire on the surface. An alligator appears. Kaufman panics, surfaces. \nOn the surface, Donald spots Kaufman pop out of the water, then get jerked back down. Donald dives. \nUnderwater. The alligator violently shakes Kaufman by the leg. Donald surfaces, comes back down with a broken propeller blade. He hacks the alligator's head off, grabs Kaufman, and brings him to the surface. \nDonald swims to shore with Kaufman in tow.    Another shot is fired. It skims the water near Kaufman. \nKAUFMAN Fuck!   Fuck, Donald, we're dead. \nDONALD We're okay. How's your leg? \nKAUFMAN I don't know. How's your back. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nDONALD It's fine.     My back is fine. \nLaroche and Orlean circle the lake in the van, shooting. \nMike Owen, in pajamas, leaves his house, jumps in his truck and agitatedly drives toward the noise and flames. \nDonald makes it to shore. He climbs out and is helping Kaufman, when he gets hit by a bullet and falls. \nKAUFMAN Donald! \nKaufman sloshes to shore. His right leg is bloody and mangled. He lifts his brother's head onto his lap. \nKAUFMAN You're gonna be okay. \nDONALD No.  But don't let them get you, too. (weak smile) You got a fucking awesome third act. \nKAUFMAN (crying) Donald, this is an awful, bizarre thing to say and an awful time to say it, but I'm sorry I didn't get to know you better. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. \nDONALD It's really... You've been really nice. \nKAUFMAN See, it's just I thought I knew you already. I thought you were me. And I hated me. \nDonald touches Kaufman's face. Kaufman looks at his brother. Donald's face glows radiantly in the fire light. \nDONALD Well, don't do that anymore.      Okay? \nKAUFMAN Okay. \nDonald dies. Kaufman screams heavenward. The van appears out of the bush, barreling for them. Kaufman rolls his brother out of the way, and limps off into a slough. The van follows, smashes into a tree, and comes to a halt. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (4) \n", "test3_id": 1694}

DRAX What are you doing? You could have killed us all crashing in here like that! 
ROCKET Uh, `Thank you, Rocket'? 
DRAX We had it under control. 
MANTIS We did not. That is only an extension of his true self. He will be back soon. 
QUILL (RE: NEBULA) What's Smurfette doing here!? 
NEBULA Back rubs, dishes, killing gods, whatever I need to do to get a damn ride home. 
ROCKET She tried to murder me! 
NEBULA I saved you, you stupid fox. 
GAMORA He's not a fox. 
GROOT I am Groot. 
ROCKET I'm not a raboon either! 
GROOT I am Groot. 
ROCKET `Raccoon,' whatever! 
Drax looks out the window. 
INT. PALACE - NIGHT 
TENTACLE-LIKE STRANDS BURST UP through the palace flooring all around the drill. 
INT. PALACE - NIGHT 
Drax turns to the others. 
DRAX How do we kill a Celestial? 
QUILL There's the center to him - his brain, his soul, whatever it is, in some sort of shell -- 
MANTIS It's in the caverns below the surface. 
Quill climbs up the ladder to see - 
QUILL YONDU? 
Nebula looks at Gamora. 
NEBULA If he's got that fin back, I am so screwed. 
I/E. PALACE - SUNRISE 
Yondu THRUSTS the ship upward for takeoff.   But TENTACLES wrap around the ship -- 
And YANK IT BACK DOWN into the floor, destroying the foundation of the palce. 
THE ENTIRE PALACE SLOPES. 
INT. LASER DRILL - SUNRISE 
Everyone FALLS forward. 
YONDU Thrusters are out! 
Quill starts rewiring the mechanics. 
QUILL I guess I should be glad I was a skinny kid. Otherwise you would have delivered me to this maniac! 
YONDU You still reckon that's the reason I kept you around, you idiot?! 
QUILL That's what you told me, you old doofus! 
YONDU Once I figured out what happened to them other kids, I wasn't gonna just hand you over. 
QUILL You said you were gonna eat me! 
YONDU That was being funny! 
QUILL Not to me!! 
ROCKET You people have issues. 
Quill sees THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD where EGO'S CREEPY SKELETAL is GROWING IN FRONT OF THEM. 
QUILL Of course I have issues that's my fricking father!!... Thrusters are back up. 
Quill thrusts the ship FORWARD instead of up. 
It CRASHES through Ego and DOWN THE SLOPING FLOOR -- 
And OUT THROUGH the giant pane of glass at the end. 
I/E. LASER DRILL/CRACK IN THE PLANET - SUNRISE 
Everyone holds on in what's essentially the worst roller coaster drop ever. 
YONDU We should be going up! 
QUILL We can't. Ego wants to eradicate the universe as we know it. We have to kill him. 
They PLUMMET toward a fissure in the earth below.   It's too small for the ship. 
QUILL (CONT'D) Rocket! 
ROCKET Got it. 
Rocket BLASTS the lasers perfectly, CHIPPING AWAY PIECES of rock, forming an opening in the crack. 
They SMASH into the opening, barely fitting, leading down into the planet. 
Quill flies perfectly, TWISTING through tunnels and around corners. 
Rocket mans the lasers, BLASTING PIECES OUT OF PLACE just in time so they can SCRAPE through. 
ROCKET (CONT'D) So, we're saving the galaxy again?

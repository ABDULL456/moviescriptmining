HEATH (CONT'D) I'm sure we are all in agreement that we must do nothing for the moment that will further inflame the current situation. 
MINISTER 1 Hear hear, Prime Minister. 
MARGARET leans forward for a better view, trying to catch his eye. HEATH wavers, mid-speech. All turn to look at MARGARET - who sits unwavering. HEATH resumes. 
HEATH - the fact of the matter is, it's absolutely crucial that we are seen by the public to be acting as conciliators and not aggressors. (Finally acknowledging Margaret) Yes, Education Secretary. 
MARGARET Yes... 
All eyes TURN on her again, hearing the reservation in her voice. 
MARGARET (CONT'D) Prime Minister, with the Miners' leader calling today for the army to mutiny in support of the strikes, this seems the wrong time for conciliation. 
SUDDENLY ALL THE LIGHTS GO OUT. 
A lot of `bloody hell' `oh for god's sake'. 
HEATH Be patient. They'll come back on in a minute. 
A beam of light cuts through, just for an instant picking out HEATH'S moon-like face surrounded by darkness. MARGARET holds the small torch. 
HEATH (CONT'D) Thank you, Margaret. 
A snigger, then the lights flicker back on. 
HEATH (CONT'D) Your thoughts are duly noted. 
MARGARET turns of the torch and clicks her handbag shut in satisfaction. Heath's words echo in her head, `compromise...compromise...compromise...' An inward look as she's caught by a memory. 
ALFRED (O.S.) We on this island are strong. We're self-reliant. Napoleon called us a nation of shopkeepers. 
INT. TOWN HALL. 1949. NIGHT. The packed town hall, ALFRED ROBERTS in full flow on stage. 
ALFRED He meant it as an insult but to me it's a compliment. That's why he couldn't beat us, and that's why Hitler can't beat us. 
The crowd of men applaud. The lone woman in their midst, YOUNG MARGARET watches her father, face aglow. 
ALFRED (CONT'D) We Conservatives believe in giving people the freedom and opportunity to fulfil their own potential, especially the young. There's no good in pretending we're all equal, we're not all the same, never have been, never will be. We should encourage our children to aspire to achieve more than we have, for our children today will be the leaders of tomorrow. 
INT. CAR. STREET. CENTRAL LONDON. 1974. DAWN ...CAROL and MARGARET seated, driving steadily along a deserted street. MARGARET thoughtful as the radio plays. 
VOICE ON THE RADIO It's 1974 and you'd think it was WWII. Blackouts, no petrol. It's a mess. Heath should resign now and make way for someone who's not afraid to tackle the unions. 
CAROL'S nervous prattle begins to break through. 
CAROL I swear, it's all gone completely out of my head. My driving instructor thinks I should pass but I feel as if I've hardly had any lessons. Ridiculous isn't it? Maybe third time lucky. MARGARET Right. The only thing you should remember is that everyone else is either reckless or inept. And often both. MARGARET eyes the road, gesturing CAROL to move forward. 
MARGARET (CONT'D) One must be brave if one is to take the wheel- 
CAROL Right-o. 
MARGARET Move over... Move to your right a little bit... 
CAROL But if I move to the right aren't I on the wrong side of the road? 
MARGARET Carol! 
CAROL Well he's in the way! 
MARGARET To the right. Move to the right! A yelp from CAROL as the car swerves a little, narrowly missing a lone CYCLIST- MARGARET (CONT'D) So sorry! Terribly sorry! MARGARET throws a wave from the wound down window. The CYCLIST swerves on recognizing her, watching as the car goes round and round the square, almost balletic.

H O F S T E T T E R T A K E S HIS CHANCE TO RUN - now scrambling against the stampede - Diggs disentangles himself and levels his weapon - the stampede parting - throwing themselves to the ground as-- 
- B O O M - DIGGS FIRES - the scattershot hits Hofstetter a s he flees up some steps - peppering his leg - sparks off metal as Diggs keeps firing - his weapon now earned the name of a "rainmaker". H O F S T E T T E R R E A C H E S A CATWALK - his leg dragging, numbing from t h e tranquilizer cores - the catwalk dead-ends - blind panic now - He ducks under the rail, reaching for the dome - finding a precarious handhold, he swings across - trying to climb -- 
D I G G S COMES UP BENEATH - looking up, grinning - the pathetic sight of Hofstetter - one leg useless - clinging to the dome like a fly trapped under glass - as Burdon goes to recover him - 
DIGGS Don't bother. He'll drop by himself. B u r d o n pulls out some handcuffs and stands waiting. Diggs returns to the booth. Pouring out two tequila shots, he grins at Scheer - 
DIGGS N o w . . . where were we? 
104   EXT . THE DESERT - MORNING 
S u n l i g h t blinks off a chain of carriages, travelling the trench of a lodeway. The overnight shuttle slits through the desert. 
105   INT . PASSENGER CAR - MORNING The sun is a muted orb behind polarized glass. Lincoln stares out of the window at the bleak new world blurring past. He's wearing Ozzie's ballcap o v e r his crosshatch, his former clothes discarded for some of the old man's ill-fitting denims. Perhaps a disguise or perhaps just to shed the memory. He glances across at Ester, dressed likewise, her hair teased to cover her crosshatch. She's dozing, head rested on the glass. A TICKET COLLECTOR comes up- 
TICKET COLLECTOR Tickets... Lincoln looks at the man in uniform, uncertain what he wants. The ticket collector shakes his head. These two look like deadbeats. 
T I C K E T COLLECTOR (CONT'D) A d u l t fare is forty five currency units. Do you have the money, sir? 
Lincoln assimilates. Money. The word is familiar. He pulls out the blue plastic card. The man in uniform looks encouraged. He gives him the card, watching him slot it into a handheld device, which briefly flashes, then the card is returned. Lincoln sees a strip at the top is now transparent, like a depleted reservoir. He assimilates. Not so different from the transactions in the world below. Then he notices Ester is awake and is looking at him. Her bright eyes, dim and troubled, somehow accusatory. 
LINCOLN I t ' s going to be okay, Ester. 
ESTER (faint) Is it? 
LINCOLN We just need to get out of state. 
Ester , disconsolate, looks out of the window. In her gaze, the forlorn air of a hatchling fallen from the nest. Lincoln watches her, knowing her troubles and knowing that he cannot relieve them. 
106   EXT . PHOENIX - DAY 
The skyline stands reprised in daylight. A glimmering citadel. 
107   EXT . SHUTTLE STOP - PHOENIX - DAY 
P a s s e n g e r s climb the steps from an underground gloom. Lincoln and Ester with them, jostled by the more certain flow. They cross the portal onto the street and stop, dazzled by the sunlight. Only to be dazzled again by the sudden, stunning prospect of the city... 
F i r s t there's the quality of light, a burning white, perhaps from depleted ozone, depicting everything in a surreal shimmer. Then there's the towers, darkly crystalline, facets of polarized glass rising to domes and spires, like monolothic f i n g e r s reaching for the sky. The traffic flashing past, the chassis identifiable as trucks, taxis, compacts, sedans, streamlined in a nautical trim, hull runners in place of wheels. The sound of claxons, more like fog horns than car horns. Then there's the street itself, a six- l a n e lodeway, lanes marked with buoys, bobbing around on cables. 
The graceful arcs of pedestrian bridges at the intersections. The citizens, strange hairstyles, fashions, all wearing sunglasses. Even to us it's a wondrous sight. The urbanism, the grandeur, as if here in the heart of southwest, Manhattan has met Venice. 
V O I C E (O.S.) He y , man, spare a little green? 
A w e interrupted, Lincoln and Ester look around. Slouched by the street exit is A HOBO with a mangy dog. He grins toothlessly- 
T H E HOBO A i n ' t eaten in two days, have we, boy? 
Lincoln and Ester step back as the dog rises to greet them. Tail wagging, it noses forward, sniffing. Then, abruptly, drops its tail and backs off, whining. Lincoln and Ester likewise back off. Both sides have just discovered a new species. The hobo pets his whining canine, watching the strangers walk off with curiosity. 
108   EXT . STREET - DAY 
The sunlight flares off passing vehicles, hypnotic. The faces of pedestrians flash past. Lincoln and Ester wander in thrall up the street. Everywhere new sights, new curiosities bombard them... 
The storefronts, mysterious recesses behind polarized glass. The glass, alive with pixellated g r a p h i c s , marquees: "Temps! Temps! New Tech Opportunities!" - "Beauty Therapy! Manicures, Dermals, Follicle Grafts!" - "Discount Legal Service! Class Actions Only!" 
H o l o f r a m e b i l l b o a r d s loom over the street, huge shimmering panels like phantom jumbotrons, commercials playing on a loop: - - A businessman in a conference room, shrinking from a fierce negotiation; the scene replayed with the same businessman, now on his feet, stabbing his finger angrily in the air; a pill bottle in CU, a text super "Combatrine! The Aggression Enhancer" - - A teenager bemused by his homework: his parents escorting him into a clinic; the teenager hooded by an electronic dome; his parents clapping; the teenager smiling as he accepts a diploma; a text super "Intellex: Data Impression For A New Generation" 
Lincoln suddenly looks round, realizing Ester is gone from his side. He scans the sea of faces. Then spots her stepping through a doorway. Over the threshold is a holoform: a pig with wings, circled by the legend "Hog Heaven! Home Of The True Hamburger". 
109   INT . HOG HEAVEN - DAY 
F a s t food outlets have evidently changed little. Promotional posters in 3D: "Ham Slam", "Porker Forkers", "Bacon Blitz". 
Service counter, seating area. Ester is looking around like Alice In Wonderland. Lincoln comes up, out of breath, edgy- 
LINCOLN I told you to stay with me. 
ESTER ( i n n o c e n t , plaintive) I'm hungry. 
LINCOLN O k a y . Okay... 
He nods, realizing he is too. He plants Ester in a seat and looks around. People stand in line transacting, receiving food trays. Not unlike nutrition plaza. Lincoln ventures to the counter. He offers the blue card hopefully. THE SERVICE CLERK looks at him- 
T H E SERVICE CLERK A r e you gonna tell me what you want? 
LINCOLN ( b e a t , no other reference) What are my options? 
T H E SERVICE CLERK K n o c k yourself out, buddy. 
He indicates a menu above. Lincoln assimilates, looking up at the menu. Understanding now, his face lifts to almost a smile. It's the first time he's been given an unrestricted choice. 
110   INT . SEATING AREA - A FEW MINUTES LATER 
Lincoln returns to Ester with a tray of food and drink. She's staring off again, distant. He puts a burger and drink cup in front of her. She seems not to notice. He tries to engage her- 
LINCOLN I asked the man how to get to the terminal. He said it's not far. 
But Ester just keeps staring, her brow now furrowing as A LITTLE GIRL skips past, maybe 11, sipping a soda. Now Lincoln sees her too and is transfixed. Now the little girl notices the strangers, staring at her. She hurries onward, uncomfortable. Lincoln and Ester's eyes follow. It's the first time they've seen a child.

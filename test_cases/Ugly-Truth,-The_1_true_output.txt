She looks at Mike in amazement, then breaks into the happy dance. He watches, horrified at her spazziness. 
MIKE What the hell is that?! 
As she continues to dork out, we CUT TO -- 
56   EXT. BALLPARK - DAY                                               56 
The ROAR of the crowd at the Lobos game. 
Colin walks with Abby, who adjusts something in her ear. Now she's wearing the earpiece from the station, and on the other end... 
MIKE'S POV THROUGH BINOCULARS -- A different angle of Abby walking down the aisle. 
MIKE Nod if you can hear me. 
BINOCULARS POV -- Abby nods.

MIKE (CONT'D) Just relax. You're gonna be fine. I'll walk you through this. 
Colin looks at Abby and smiles as they take their seats,               * popcorn in hand.                                                       * 
COLIN Do you follow baseball? 
We INTERCUT with Mike. 
MIKE There's no right answer to that question. Do something non- committal... 
Abby does something between a nod and shaking her head. Colin hooks at her, confused. 
COLIN I'm really more of a fair weather fan myself. I do like watching Mike DeLoggia pitch, though. Amazing bone structure. 
MIKE Laugh. 
Abby is baffled but proceeds to laugh awkwardly. Colin looks at her. 
COLIN What's so funny? 
ABBY Your joke. 
COLIN What joke? 
MIKE Shit, he was serious? 
Feeling a popcorn kernel in her teeth, Abby takes out her              * floss.                                                                 * 
MIKE                                            * Wait -- what the fuck are you                             * doing? Is that floss?                                     * 
Abby freezes.                                                          *

MIKE                                             * Jesus!    Put that away!                                     * 
She puts the floss back in her purse.                                  * 
MIKE (CONT'D)                                      * Good. Now toss your hair.                                    * 
She dramatically tosses her hair from one side to the other. 
MIKE (CONT'D) Okay, that was a little over the top, but nice try. 
ABBY Thank you. 
COLIN For what? 
Abby realizes she's spoken aloud. 
ABBY Thank you for... just being you. 
COLIN You're welcome... 
MIKE Okay, no more improvising. Just repeat everything I say, "You're so much fun to be with." 
ABBY You're so much fun to be with. 
COLIN Thanks. 
A FAN calls to Mike. 
FAN Hey, down in front! 
Mike gestures for the fan to leave him alone as he continues to instruct Abby. 
MIKE (to Abby) You're not like the other guys I`ve dated.

SAILOR #1 Touch that phone, kid, and you lose your left nut. Nick raises his hands. "You don't have to tell me twice." 
JERRY Please. Please don't hurt me. It's all I got, guys. I swear. Take the Lincoln! 
SAILOR #1 I don't want the Lincoln. I want my nine-hundred dollars. I'm taking the sixty-three, which means you owe me another eight hundred and thirty. 
NICK Eight hundred and thirty seven, actually. 
SAILOR #1 Exactly. Have it by tomorrow or you'll be found in the trunk of your new used piece of shit at the bottom of the Bay. And with that they release him and Jerry crumples to the floor like an abandoned marionette. 
INT. ESTELLE'S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 
The three of them watch the fleet pile into a Navy van that reads FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY. The moment they pull out, Jerry dusts himself off and puts on a pretense of being unfazed. 
JERRY Wow, those guys are even dumber than I thought. They actually think I'm stupid enough to let them muscle me into paying. 
ESTELLE Jerry, what are you talking about? We need to call the police! 
JERRY I'm not some tattle-tale like your son. Nick rolls his eyes. 
ESTELLE Then for God's sake, Jerry, just sell the Lincoln and pay them! 
JERRY Can't. It's in The Code. 
ESTELLE What code? The vehicular code? 
JERRY Code of the streets, Babe. Code of the streets. 
ESTELLE Then what are you planning to do? Jerry takes a seat at the kitchen table and adopts The Thinker pose. He strokes his chin as Nick and Estelle await his brilliant solution with breathless anticipation. 
I/E. LINCOLN - DAY 
NICK (V.O.) We are going to Ukiah for a last minute vacation. Jerry's got on a hat made from Coors beer cans. He's behind the wheel of his Lincoln convertible. 
NICK (V.O.) Jerry says we'll be staying in a cabin on Clear Lake that's owned by a friend of his. Estelle dumps in the cooking gear and closes the trunk. Her halter top looks like an advertisement for Droop City. Nick's in the back. Estelle waves at the neighbors like she's Miss Corn Dog of 1954. 
ESTELLE Goodbye, everyone! We're going on vacation! 
JERRY Let's blow! 
She hops up front with Jerry. He fires up the Lincoln and the radio roars to life with HILLBILLY MUSIC. 
NICK (V.O.) I'm not sure how this is the solution to his problem. But I've decided to go along with it, seeing as I'm not rooting for him anyway. As they pull out, Jerry tosses his beer bottle at the garbage can at the end of the drive and it once again misses and shatters on the street behind them. 
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY 
The Lincoln makes it's way upstate, and dips into the mist covered hills of Ukiah. 
EXT. RESTLESS AXLES TRAILER PARK - DAY 
They've pulled to a stop. Estelle stares in horror. 
ESTELLE Jerry...? You said it was a cabin. In the back, Nick removes his sunglasses to regard the long, green, turd of a trailer. Some concrete dwarves in the grass. A dusty canvas awning over a small cement patio. A decrepit picket fence with a sign that reads: MY GREEN HAVEN. Estelle looks as if she's about to cry. Jerry puts his arm around her. 
JERRY C'mon Estelle. It's real cute on the inside. 
INT. MY GREEN HAVEN - NIGHT 
Substitute cluttered for cute. The three of them are crammed around a dining surface as accommodating as an airplane tray table. 3-D religious art hangs on the wall above them. 
JERRY I say the kid does the dishes and we retire to the master bedroom. Jerry pushes out and disappears into the back. Nick watches him with loathing. Estelle smiles apologetically. 
NICK Mom? Do you really like Jerry? Her smile fades. 
ESTELLE Nick, how   many men do you think there are   who'd be interested in a forty-one   year old woman with two brats, no   money, and stretch marks? And with that she excuses herself, leaving Nick to ponder. 
NICK (V.O.) Mom is a realist about everything. Except her age. She's forty-three. 
INT. MY GREEN HAVEN - LATER 
Nick washes dishes in the toilet-like sink. The trailer shakes from the two adults flogging the mattress in the back. 
EXT. RESTLESS AXLES TRAILER PARK - DAY 
An old crone, MRS. SAUNDERS, makes her way up the walk. She gets to the door of My Green Haven and bangs on the screen.

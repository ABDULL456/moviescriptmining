CHARLIE Yeah. 
TONY You flew before? 
CHARLIE No. 
CUT TO: 
CHARLIE'S face - slightly upset. 
CHARLIE snapping seat belt in car. 
CUT TO: 
STOCK SHOT: airplane exploding BLACK AND WHITE (FANTASY) 
CUT BACK TO: 
CHARLIE in car - more upset. 
CHARLIE (IRRITATED) Hey, come on... 
TONY Take it easy. I only asked because maybe I could, you know, let you have a little something. 
CHARLIE Yeah, well thanks, but I got enough to hold me. My mother can send me some. I don't know. 
TONY How about Teresa? I could talk... 
CHARLIE (trying not to be impatient) Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself. I'll write. 
TONY And say what? 
CHARLIE I'll say that I'm travelling. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. AIRPORT - DAY 
The TWA terminal at Kennedy. TONY'S car pulls up to the curb, CHARLIE gets out, waves away help from an idle porter, and pulls his suitcases out of the back seat. TONY leans across the seat toward him. 
TONY Listen, try a place with some sun. Swimming pools. Palm trees. Girls in little French bathing suits. 
CHARLIE (SMILES) Thanks for the ride. 
CHARLIE breaks away from the handshake and grabs TONY affectionately behind the neck. 
CHARLIE Take care of that tiger. 
TONY (CORRECTING HIM) Panther... 
CHARLIE Panther! Same thing... 
TONY Hey...no more good times like before. Until you come back. 
CHARLIE Sure. And you're gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right. 
TONY (LAUGHS) Yeah, I'm gonna worry about you, too. 
TONY gives CHARLIE'S hand a last slap, then gets back behind the wheel. 
TONY See you. 
CHARLIE nods and watches the car pull away. Then he picks up his bag from the sidewalk and walks into the terminal. 
CUT TO: 
INT. TERMINAL - DAY

HEDRA Okay ? 
Allison puts the glass down and shakes her head «Yes». Hedra strokes the back of her head. 
HEDRA Feeling better ? ALLISON Yeah. I can go out for a while. I feel much better now. 
ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY 
Allison walks out of the bathroom, followed by Hedra. 
HEDRA I thought you said breakfast ? 
Allison has reached the front door, and she starts unlocking the door. 
ALLISON Oh, it's in the blender. I've got to go out. 
Hedra looks at Allison thin sleeveless night shirt and smiles. 
HEDRA Dressed like that? 
ALLISON I'm out. I'm just going to go upstairs and see Graham. He called while you were out. 
Hedra looks at Allison with a very strange expression on her face. She can see the tears on Allison's face. 
HEDRA Well, still, if you're not feeling well, you should wear more than that. 
ALLISON Maybe you're right. 
She walks away to her room. Hedra puts her hand on her face. HEDRA Oh... 
ALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY 
Allison enters her room coming from the hall. 
HEDRA (voice over from the hall) Leave the door open so we can talk. 
Allison grabs a pair of pants and puts them on. 
Hedra enters slowly in the room, carrying the large paper bag where she has put the gun. 
Allison takes her night shirt off. She is now naked from the waist up. But she grabs a sweater and puts it on. 
HEDRA You know why I think you're sick ? 
While talking, Hedra slowly slides her hand into the paper bag, takes a pair of black gloves out of the bag and puts the bag down on the floor. 
HEDRA You're upset about Sam. 
Slowly, Hedra puts the black gloves on her hands. 
HEDRA You know Sam's dead, don't you ? 
Allison turns around to face Hedra. 
HEDRA Yeah, we don't have much time. 
She picks up the bag and walks to a chest of drawers. She puts the bag on the floor and opens the top drawer. 
ALLISON (crying) You didn't... you didn't do it, Hedy, did you ? 
Hedra is taking white pantie and bra from the drawer 
ALLISON (crying) You couldn't have him ! 
She falls down, sitting on the floor and crying. 
ALLISON Why ?... Why ? 
HEDRA Allie, he came in my mouth. Then he tried to beat the shit out of me because I wanted to tell you. 
She slams the drawer shut, and opens another one. HEDRA You know, it was an accident. But he deserved it. 
She claps her hands. 
HEDRA Okay, come on. The police will be here soon. 
Allison doesn't move and remains seated on the floor. 
ALLISON But... but you shouldn't run. That'll only make it worse. I know you weren't yourself when you did this, Hedy. 
Hedra laughs. 
HEDRA I know. I was you. 
She points her gloved finger to Allison, and then looks at herself in the mirror. HEDRA Who is this Hedy anyway ? 
She turns around, and walks away from the mirror towards Allison. 
HEDRA No one's seen her. She's not on the lease. There's not even a fingerprint of hers here. I've been cleaning like crazy. You have to come with me, Allie, or they'd put you away. 
ALLISON Hedy, it'll never work. Besides ... people have seen you. We just can't tell. We'll go to a lawyer or a doctor and they'll explain it to the police, or something. 
Hedra, who is now very upset, knocks everything, that was on top of the chest of drawer, with a long sweeping movement, down on the floor.

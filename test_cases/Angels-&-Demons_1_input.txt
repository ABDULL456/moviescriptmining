Olivetti nods to her, come on along. They walk again, holds a hand out to Langdon. 
VITTORIA (cont'd) Vittoria Vetra. Are you really a symbologist, or was he mocking you? 
LANGDON Both.    You're a physicist? 
VITTORIA (NODS) Bio-entanglement physics. Interconnectivity of life systems. 
LANGDON Okay. 
VITTORIA What are we looking for in the archives? 
LANGDON A little book written by Galileo. 
VITTORIA Galileo was llluminati? 
LANGDON And a devout Catholic.     He thought science and religion weren't enemies, but two different languages telling the same story.     He wanted like minds to be able to find the Church of Illumination, but he couldn't exactly advertise its location, so he created a coded path.     An unknown llluminati master sculpted four statues, each a tribute to one of the four fundamental elements -- earth, air, fire, water -- and put them out in public, in churches throughout Rome.     Each statue held a clue, pointing to the next. And at the end of the trail was the Church of Illumination. 
Vicenzo, leading them, turns up Via Sentinel and starts up the hill toward the Archives. They follow, quickly. 
OLIVETTI What makes you think he's going to murder the cardinals in the churches? 
LANGDON The llluminati called those four churches by a special name -- L'Altare di scienza.    The altars of science. 
VITTORIA (making the CONNECTION) "Sacrifice them on the altars of science," he said. 
Langdon stops in his tracks. 
LANGDON Oh.   Oh, wow. 
He's staring up at the impressive facade of the Vatican Archives. He takes a deep breath, then steps forward to enter.    But Vincenzo doesn't follow.    Langdon looks at him. 
LANGDON (cont'd) We go in alone? 
OLIVETTI Vatican Police aren't allowed access to the archives, only Swiss Guard. Lt. Chartrand will meet you inside. I'll be here when you're done. 
Langdon turns back to the Archives with a look of deep contentment -- he's wanted in here for a long, long time. 
And steps through the double doors. 
CUT TO: 
INT     APOSTOLIC PALACE        DAY 
The Camerlengo walks briskly through the hallways of the Apostolic Palace, deep in thought.    He reaches the top of the Royal Staircase, and can hear the RUMBLING of activity in the Sistine Chapel below. 
Looking down the stairs, he sees the doorway open, and the gathering of cardinals inside.    As he reaches the base of the stairs, Cardinal Mortati, who has been summoned, steps outside to meet him, flanked by his aide, Father Simeon. 
Vincenzo, leading them, turns up Via Sentinel and starts up the hill toward the Archives.    They follow, quickly. 
They speak in English, their common language. 
CAMERLENGO You've been informed of the new situation? 
MORTATI (NODS) May God's mercy be upon us. 
CAMERLENGO And the other cardinals? 
MORTATI Await your word. 
The Camerlengo thinks, feels the weight of this decision on his young shoulders. 
CAMERLENGO May I ask your guidance, Padre? 
MORTATI My belief is we should proceed with the sealing of conclave. 
CAMERLENGO At this hour?        That would be highly unorthodox. 
MORTATI And yet within church law.    It's in my power, I've been chosen Great Elector. 
CAMERLENGO The cruelest honor in Christendom. 
MORTATI The only ambitions I have are for my church.    St. Peter's church, which is under attack at its most vulnerable moment.    This is not a coincidence. Is it possible our enemies hope to distract us from our sacred task? 
CAMERLENGO The church will not fall in a day. We may be wise to consider evacuation. 
MORTATI That is exactly what they want, publicity and panic.    We must not give them oxygen for the media fire. 
CAMERLENGO What of the safety of the cardinals? 
MORTATI Surely there is not an elector present who values his physical being more than the unbroken leadership of the Holy See. 
CAMERLENGO And the people in St. Peter's Square? 
MORTATI They care as deeply about their church as we do.    Their faith will sustain them. 
CAMERLENGO But if their faith does not protect them from an explosion? 
MORTATI We're all bound for heaven eventually, are we not? 
CAMERLENGO Spoken like one who has enjoyed the blessings of a long and full life. 
Mortati bristles at the thinly-veiled insult. 
MORTATI Signore, do not confuse the power of the office you temporarily hold with your true place here in the Vatican. You were a favorite of His Holiness, but His Holiness is with his Father now. 
CAMERLENGO Mea culpa. 
Satisfied, Mortati looks back over his shoulder, at the anxious faces in the Chapel.    Then turns back to the Camerlengo. 
MORTATI Seal the doors. 
With a heavy THUD, the huge doors close and bolts SLAM into place. An ancient key GRINDS in an ornate lock, two heavy chains RATTLE into place, FOUR SWISS GUARD take position in front of the doors and at that very moment --

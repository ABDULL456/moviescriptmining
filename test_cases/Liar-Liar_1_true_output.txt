FLETCHER/TERMINATOR I have been sent from the future to destroy you. . . Argghhh! (no response, a 
BEAT) You mad at me? Max nods. Fletcher's at a loss for how to begin. Then: 
FLETCHER You wanted me to stop lying. But lying isn't the problem. .. Why we lie ~ that's the problem. Sometimes we lie to make someone else feel better. But sometimes we lie because the truth gets in our way... (touches him) But being an adult means you sacrifice some things for more 
important things. Much more important things. I was so stupid, Max. (pointing to his own head) Malfunction in vector one. All this time you've been here and I could see you anytime I felt like it. And I... didn't. Please don't go to Boston. Max, I love you more than anything else in the world and you know it's true. I couldn't say it if it weren't true. Not today. A moment as Max studies his father, then: 
MAX (to Audrey) He's telling the truth, Mom. He's not allowed to lie. I made a wish and anything Dad says has to be the truth. (to Fletcher) .. Right? But Fletcher's looking at his watch... 
FLETCHER Max. .. it's 9:22. 
AUDREY What? 
FLETCHER Max, you made the wish at 9:15. I've been able to lie for the last seven minutes. Max steps away from Fletcher. 
MAX So then, you were... 
FLETCHER No! It wasn't a lie. I just wanted to be honest with you and tell you -- there was no wish to guarantee it anymore. You just have to believe me. Max looks at Audrey, who is letting Max decide for himself Max looks at Fletcher and tries to decide. 
MAX (to Audrey) Mommy... do we have to go to Boston? Audrey looks at Jerry, then back at Max. 
AUDR EY No.      We don't have to. Fletcher hugs his son -- the kind of hug that says "I'll never let you go." 
MAX (to Fletcher) Can we play catch tomorrow? Fletcher smiles. . . 
EXT. PARK - DAY 
A beautiful park with a basball diamond. Fletcher is seated on a bench, waiting. He's dressed in sweats, with a baseball glove. Soon, Jerry, Audrey, and Max pull up... 
M AX Dad! ! 
FLETCH ER Ma x i mu m ! ! Fletcher picks Max up. 
MAX Transformer!!! . Fletcher and Max do the TRANSFORMER ROUTINE again... 
FLETCHER Malfunction in vector seven. I have lost control of my affection reflex... Fletcher starts KISSING MAX on the head over and over. He sees Audrey. 
FLETCHER Procreate!          Procreate! 
AUDREY 
(PLAYFULLY) Fletcher... You're gonna lose a limb-- 
MAX Come on, dad, let's play catch!! 
FLETCHER Sr. . . 
UE (starts to toss 
MAX) Here you go, mom. (Max screams) Oh, you mean with a ball... He puts Max down. Max runs into position. Fletcher stops for a second and turns to Jerry, man to man. 
FLETCHER I take back every dirty, dishonest thing I ever said about you, wrote about you, faxed about you, E-mailed about you. 
JERRY Appreciated. Fletcher tosses the baseball up and down. 
FLETCHER So, you up for a little friendly competition? 
JERRY No, you go play with your son. 
FLETCHER I wasn't talking about basesball. A slow smile from Jerry. Fletcher winks and tosses the ball to Max. 
FLETCHER (to Max) Alright, it's time to show you the old Fletcher Reid change up. 
Fletcher winds up in an EXAGERATED SUPER FAST MOTION, then instantly shifts to SUPER SLOW MOTION. Max CRACKS UP. Audrey LAUGHS. Jerry can't help but smile, too. There may be better things in life... but at this moment, it's hard to think of a single one. Honestly.

DALE (CONT'D) (pissed off) I think the battery's dead. 
SAUL Are you fucking serious? 
He tries again. 
DALE It's dead. 
SAUL It's dead? 
Dale shoots Saul an angry look. 
SAUL (CONT'D) What the fuck happened? How did this happen? 
DALE How? We fell asleep! 
SAUL Yeah. With your stupid talk radio. No surprise, that stuffs, like, made to put people to sleep. 
Frustrated, Dale tries to gather his thoughts. 
DALE We gotta...let's just...we'll walk. We'll walk to a road and hitchhike to Red's. 
SAUL For real? 
Dale opens his door and hops out. 
DALE Yeah, "for real". We'll be late, but we'll get there. Then we can fix this insane situation. 
MONTAGE: 
- Dale and Saul walk down a seemingly unused forest road, each smoking their own joint. 
- Saul points out a giant caterpillar crawling on a leaf. Dale is grossed out. Saul pokes the caterpillar and then blows weed smoke onto it. 
DALE (CONT'D) Stop fucking around, man. Come on. Leave that thing alone. 
- They emerge at the highway and try to hitch a ride. 
- Dale notices Saul has his thumb sticking out of his zipper. 
SAUL It's like, my thumb is my cock! 
Dale doesn't laugh. 
- Bored and tired, they wait.   Saul lights a joint. Dale notices. Saul shifts his body   away from Dale. Just then, an eighteen wheeler slows for   them. Saul snubs out the freshly lit joint and puts it   in his pocket. 
EXT. RED'S HOUSE - LATER 
Dale and Saul get out of the eighteen wheeler. 
SAUL (to the driver) Thanks a fucking ton, Sharid. 
Saul shuts the door and he and Dale run towards Red's house - a small, dilapidated place in a rundown part of town. Exhausted, Dale and Saul reach Red's door. Saul knocks. 
DALE So, what's this guy like? 
SAUL I don't know. He's short...and stout. So he's like a tea pot. Hehe. 
DALE Well, do you think he'll be there? 
SAUL I don't know, I mean, we are only...eight hours late. (beat) That's actually pretty late. 
RED (O.S.) (through door) Who is it? 
SAUL Red! It's Saul. Open up. 
Red opens the door. He has a SPLIT LIP and has clearly been CRYING. He tries to act normal. Dale immediately suspects something is up. 
RED (sniffling) Who's this guy? 
DALE Dale. Nice to meet you. 
Red ushers them in and shuts the door. 
RED Dale who? 
DALE I think it's    better if you don't know my last- 
SAUL (oblivious) Dale Denton. He's with me. No worries. 
Red notices their dirty clothes.

DANTE Seven months. 
RANDAL Chick's nuts about you. How long did you date Caitlin? 
DANTE Five years. 
RANDAL Chick only made you nuts. She cheated on you how many times? 
DANTE Eight and a half. 
RANDAL (looks up from paper) Eight and a half? 
DANTE Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me. 
RANDAL That's cheating? 
DANTE In the middle of it, she calls me Brad. 
RANDAL She called you Brad? 
DANTE She called me Brad. 
RANDAL That's not cheating. People say crazy shit during sex. One time, I called this girl "Mom." 
DANTE I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson. 
RANDAL What do you mean? 
DANTE She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party. 
RANDAL Oh, my God. 
DANTE Great story, isn't it? 
RANDAL That girl was vile to you. 
DANTE Interesting postscript to that story: Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom? 
RANDAL Your mother. 
DANTE Allan Harris. 
RANDAL Chess team Allan Harris?! 
DANTE The two moved to Idaho together after graduation. They raise sheep. 
RANDAL That's frightening. 
DANTE It takes different strokes to move the world. 
RANDAL In light of this lurid tale, I don't see how you could even romanticize your relationship with Caitlin-she broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles. 
DANTE Because there was a lot of good in our relationship. 
RANDAL Oh yeah. 
DANTE I'm serious. Aside from the cheating, we were a great couple. That's what high school's all about-algebra, bad lunch, and infidelity. 
RANDAL You think things would be any different now? 
DANTE They are. When she calls me now, she's a different person-she's frightened and vulnerable. She's about to finish college and enter the real world. That's got to be scary for anyone. 
RANDAL (suddenly recalling) Oh shit, I've got to place an order. 
DANTE I'm talking to myself here. 
RANDAL No, no, I'm listening. She's leaving college, and...? 
DANTE ...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level. 
RANDAL What about Veronica? 
DANTE I think the arguments Veronica and I are having are some kind of manifestation of a subconscious desire to break away from her so that I can pursue the possibility of a more meaningful relationship with Caitlin. 
RANDAL Caitlin's on the same wave-length? 
DANTE I think it's safe to say yes. 
RANDAL Then I think all four of you had better sit down and talk it over. 
DANTE All four? 
RANDAL You, Veronica, Caitlin... (lays paper flat) ...and Caitlin's fianc√©. 
THE HEADLINE of the engagement announcement reads, BREE TO WED ASIAN DESIGN MAJOR. 
CUT TO: 
INT: VIDEO STORE. DAY 
RANDAL dials the phone. He holds a list in his hand. 
RANDAL Yes, I'd like to place an order, please...Thank you. 
A MOTHER and her SMALL CHILD approach the counter. 
MOTHER Excuse me, but do you see videotapes?

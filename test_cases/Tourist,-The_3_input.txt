An immediate hit in the data base. Alexander Pearce's page fills the screen. The caption reads: 
#6 on INTERPOL'S MOST WANTED LIST. 
In place of a photograph there is just a black outline of a man's head. 
Frank is about to scan for more information when he hears Domenico returning. He quickly steps back into the room where he was left... 
DOMENICO enters carrying a garish SWEAT SUIT.   He hands it to Frank. 
DOMENICO (CONT'D) Here.     Put these on. Time to go. 
Frank looks at the clothes. 
FRANK Um... thanks.   Where are we going? 
DOMENICO I'm taking you to the hospital, Mr. Taylor. A doctor should take a look at you. 
FRANK I'd really rather just go-- 
DOMENICO Don't worry. I put you in Padua, away from Venice. You'll be safe. (scribbles his number) Any worry, you call me. I give you my home number. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOSPITAL SCANNING ROOM, PADUA - EVENING 
Frank lies flat on his back. 
A NURSE leans over him with a kindly expression. 
NURSE Relax signore. We're just going to make sure everything is all right inside your head. 
She slides him slowly into the mouth of an MRI scanning machine head first. It hums to life. 
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR, DANIELI - EVENING 
Domenico whistles as a hotel clerk escorts him to to the Doge's suite. 
CLERK (in Italian) Unfortunately we've already re-let the room. (nervous) We'd rather the guests didn't know about the incident. 
DOMENICO Don't worry.   I'll be discreet. 
CLERK Grazie. 
The Clerk knocks.   The door is opened by Ivan Demidov. 
CLERK (CONT'D) I beg your pardon, Signore, but this is a police officer. He needs to briefly examine the room. 
DEMIDOV Of course. 
Demidov steps back, holding the door open. 
INT. DOGE'S SUITE, DANIELI - EVENING 
Demidov watches Domenico, who sniffs around. 
DEMIDOV (casually) What happened, officer? 
DOMENICO That's what I'm trying to find out, Signore. 
Domenico gets down on his hands and knees and looks around. He spots something under the sofa and fishes it out with his penknife... a spent bullet casing. 
He puts it in a plastic bag, pleased with himself. Demidov catches his eye. He smiles at him. 
DEMIDOV You are a good detective. 
DOMENICO I do my best. 
Domenico stands and takes his leave. 
DOMENICO (CONT'D) Sorry for the inconvenience. Enjoy your stay. 
As he and the clerk exit, Scarface steps out from the other room. Off Demidov's look, he leaves the suite to follow... 
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, PADUA - NIGHT 
Frank lies on the bed. There are clean bandages on his injuries. 
The television drones on the wall: an Italian reality show. A WOMAN holds her hands over her eyes. The HOST taunts her: 
THE HOST (V.O.) (in Italian) Now remember, I said you were in for a surprise... a big surprise.

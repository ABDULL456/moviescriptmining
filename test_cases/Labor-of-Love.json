{"train": "LABOR OF LOVE \nby \nM. Night Shyamalan \nFADE IN: \nEXT.  ROUTE 476 - OUTSKIRTS OF PHILADELPHIA - NIGHT \nA three lane highway relegated to one lane.  The serpentine line of cars bottlenecks as it slithers by.  An arch of ORANGE AND RED FLARES outlines the area of shattered glass and twisted metal. \nWe are at the site of a gruesome car accident.  An ambulance and four police cars are on the scene.  Two cars are involved in the crash.  The first, a SILVER CADILLAC with its front caved in a perfect semi-circle; there is no-one inside the car. \nThe second car is a different story entirely.  A DARK GREEN HONDA PRELUDE crushed against the concrete median that separates the South-bound lanes from the North-bound lanes. All the windows have imploded.  The original seventeen foot length of the car, compressed to ten.  The hood has folded back into the front seat.  This car is not empty!  Through the sliver that used to be a window, WE SEE a female hand, purple, swollen and bloody. \nSome drivers have stopped their cars on the shoulder and have walked over to the flares.  A set of cops wave them back. \nPOLICE OFFICER Get back in your cars and continue with the traffic.  There is nothing you can do. (beat) Get back in your cars... \nCUT TO: \nOFFICER PIERCE speaks to a female OFFICER DANA. \nOFFICER PIERCE What's the story? \nOFFICER DANA She's been dead about ten minutes. The jaws are on the way... Ran a license check.  Her name is Ellen Parker.  Forty-two years old. \nOFFICER PIERCE What about him? \nPierce gestures to a HISPANIC TEENAGER who is cuffed behind his back and being led to a police car. \nOFFICER DANA D.U.I. \nOFFICER PIERCE Shit... How old is he? \nOFFICER DANA Seventeen.  It's his grandfather's car.  On his way back from drinking with the 'boys'. \nPierce lets it sink in. \nOFFICER PIERCE Who do we contact for her? \nDana checks the papers in her hand. \nOFFICER DANA Her husband.  Maurice Parker.  They live in Wynnewood.  Married seventeen years. \nPierce looks back at what remains of the HONDA PRELUDE. Beat. \nOFFICER PIERCE There isn't any good left in the world, Dana.  Not one damn thing. \nCLOSE UP of the hypnotic RED AND BLUE LIGHTS that consume the highway. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.  ROAD - EARLY MORNING \n\"TWO WEEKS EARLIER\" \nJust AFTER DAWN.  A gentle mist hangs in the air.  The calm suburban streets wait to be flooded with a sea of middle class homeowners on their way to work... \nA woman's REEBOK CROSS-TRAINERS move along the sidewalk... long, brisk steps, steps people have when walking with a purpose... \nThe Cross-Trainers enter the doors of a bakery store seconds after a man turns a window-sign from \"CLOSED\" to \"OPEN\"... This happens with precision timing, not losing a step... a well practiced routine. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  ANGELO'S BAKERY - MORNING \nANGELO, a large man, black slicked hair -- has laid out three identical loaves of RAISIN BREAD on the counter. \nANGELO Very good batch today. \nWe finally see the person standing in the REEBOK CROSS TRAINERS... MRS. ELLEN PARKER, a woman in her forties with a heart-warming smile and wise glint in her eyes.  The kind of woman that somehow becomes more beautiful with age. \nShe carefully squeezes each loaf.  Her hand hovers over the middle loaf. \nELLEN That one. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  KITCHEN - MORNING \nTwenty minutes later.  The basket of the \"chosen\" raisin bread is placed on the center of a table.  Ellen covers it with a cloth napkin. \nThe eggs sizzle in a pan.  We find Ellen cooking breakfast. A stunning African Grey Parrot sits proudly on Ellen's shoulder.  CLAUDE is a breathtaking creature with grey feathers and a cherry red tail. \nThe DOOR BELL RINGS. \nCUT TO: \nFRONT DOOR \nwhere a delivery man hands over a bouquet of VIOLET ORCHIDS. Claude, still perched on Ellen like a clothing accessory, spreads his impressive wings defensively.  The delivery man scans the far wall to find a collection of bird photographs. A dazzling collection of all kinds of birds, elaborately framed and hung. \nEllen signs the release and closes the door.  She takes a deep smell of the violet orchids and looks down the hall to the open bedroom door with a glowing smile.  We CATCH A GLIMPSE of a man dressing. \nCUT TO: \nKRIS You're amazing. \nMAURICE It has to be a full character's name. \nKRIS They called her 'Lizy' in the book... (beat) Sorry I was late.  My jeep died on the way over from the paper. \nMAURICE They printed your article on, 'Dry Verses Can Dog Food'... Very enlightening. \nKRIS Pulitzer, here I come. \nKris notices as Maurice goes back to searching the isles. \nKRIS What happened? \nMAURICE Never have children.  If they're not a burden to you, they're a burden to someone else. \nELLEN (on the end of his words) Kris, go to the pharmacy.  Ask Mr. Donnavan to get you a large bottle of Geritol... Tell him, Maurice has officially become a grumpy old man. \nKRIS What'd they take this time? \nMAURICE Nietzsche!... As if they're going to read Nietzsche. \nMaurice moves back behind the counter clearly irritated. \nELLEN They pick on you because they can get a rise out of you... children can sense those things. \nKris quickly opens his black shoulder bag and pulls out a mini-tape recorder.  He talks into it -- dead serious. \nKRIS Monday -- August 24... Juvenile delinquency -- Are the victims to blame? \nCLICK.  The tape recorder returns to the bag.  Ellen stares at him curiously. \nKRIS Story ideas.  I'll forget them otherwise. \nEllen nods with realization.  Ellen and Kris turn their attention to Maurice who is mumbling to himself angrily.  He looks out the window to the street to see a familiar group of school boys waving at him tauntingly. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nDIMLY LIT.  Red and gold paper mache lanterns are sprinkled around the room.  WE FIND Ellen and Maurice polishing off a dish of General Tso's Chicken. \nMAURICE Two thousand square feet... We can add a used book section. \nEllen is not listening.  She is staring at a young couple two tables over, who can't take their eyes off each other. \nMAURICE Next door is a jewelry store with a full-time security guard... He stands outside all day.  Let's see them try and take Nietzsche then... \nMaurice finally notices Ellen is not listening. \nMAURICE Ellen? \nELLEN (snapping out of it) What? \nMAURICE The new store? \nELLEN Honey, I told you.  If it makes you happy, we should just do it. \nMAURICE It's a tremendous amount of work -- moving. \nELLEN We can do it together. \nMaurice needed the support.  His face brightens. \nCUT TO: \nLATER \nAn empty table.  The dishes have been cleared.  Maurice and Ellen are opening their fortune cookies. \nMAURICE What's your's say? \nBeat. \nELLEN ... Love is shown through actions not just words. \nMAURICE What's that?  That's not a fortune... You will be rich... That's a fortune.  What you have is a statement. \nELLEN What it is -- is the truth. \nMAURICE I don't follow. \nBeat. \nELLEN Maurice, what would you do for me? What would you do for our love? I'm not talking about saying, I'm talking about doing. \nMaurice notices the STRAIN IN HER VOICE. \nMAURICE Is this going to be similar to the flower incident? \nELLEN (very emotional) Sometimes people need to see things done for them -- because sooner or later they don't believe the words anymore. \nMAURICE (raising his voice) You don't think I love you? \nCustomers react. \nELLEN (lowering the volume) I want to be shown... (beat) Maurice would you do anything for me? \nCUT TO: \nPARK BENCH \nMaurice is seated on a park bench.  Across from him is an ELDERLY COUPLE -- in their seventies.  The OLD WOMAN is frail with tiny eyes that disappear when she smiles.  The husband is a skinny man with a baseball hat that makes him look like a little boy. \nMaurice watches them silently as they sit and hold hands... Their warm laughs and whispered conversations stinging him. He watches as the old man gets up.  The old woman tries to make him stay, but he playfully pulls away.  She shakes her head like a shy school girl as the old man walks back down the path by himself. \nThe old woman glances Maurice's way. \nOLD WOMAN Good morning. \nMAURICE Good morning. \nThe old woman glances at the empty baby carriage standing next to the bench. \nOLD WOMAN Is it a boy or a girl? \nMAURICE Oh, that's not mine. \nMaurice gestures to the woman and baby who are sitting on a blanket in the grass. \nMAURICE I don't have kids. \nOLD WOMAN You should.  Children are a blessing from God.  I have four. \nThe old woman studies him. \nOLD WOMAN Are you okay? \nBeat. \nMAURICE Is that your husband? \nShe nods, \"Yes.\" \nMAURICE You look so happy -- how long have you been married? \nOLD WOMAN Forty-seven years. \nThis hits Maurice hard. \nOLD WOMAN Are you married? \nThis hits Maurice even harder. \nMAURICE (this is painful) Yes... Seventeen years. \nThe old woman looks down the path for her husband. \nMAURICE Where did he go? \nOLD WOMAN He's getting my sweater from the car.  I said there was a breeze. (shaking her head) I told him not to go. \nBeat. \nMAURICE May I ask you a question that might sound strange? \nOLD WOMAN Yes. \nBeat. \nMAURICE How do you know he loves you? \nThe old woman looks at him oddly. \nMAURICE I mean besides... time -- how did you know ten years ago -- twenty years ago? \nShe thinks hard... tough question.  No answer for a moment then -- \nThe old woman sees something out of the corner of her eye -- her husband is walking up the path with her white lace sweater over his arm... \nShe smiles as the answer comes to her. \nOLD WOMAN Because he shows me... he's not much for words, but he shows me. \nMaurice sits back -- her answer lingers in the air like a haunting voice. \nMaurice watches as the old man comes back and drapes his wife with the sweater.  The old woman waves as they continue down the path... hand in hand. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  DOCTORS OFFICE - DAY \nAn obese woman with a hacking cough sits to the left of Maurice... To the right, a man with a patch over his eye. \nNURSE Parker... Maurice Parker. \nThe nurse sticks her head outside the glass divider till Maurice stands up. \nCUT TO: \nEXAMINATION ROOM \nDR. ROYCE checks a chart.  Maurice watches him from his perch on the examination chair. \nDR. ROYCE So what's the deal Maurice? \nKRIS I want to reach people.  Nobody listens to me.  This is my way to reach them. \nMAURICE To reach people, you have to feel something first... You write about the wrong things.  How can you feel for dog food?  The people at the Gazette don't respect it, and neither do you. \nKRIS This is a ghost town.  Nothing ever happens. \nMAURICE Write from your heart.  That's why the classics are great. \nBeat. \nKRIS Why are you telling me this Mr. Parker? \nMaurice looks out the window and picks up an envelope from the coffee table between them.  He hands it to Kris. \nMAURICE Your bus is arriving. \nKris opens the envelope and finds money. \nMAURICE It's one month's pay. \nKris gets up.  A shock of adrenaline hits him. \nKRIS Are you firing me? \nMAURICE No.  No... I won't be here for a while.  The store will be closed in the interim. \nKris grabs his coat, shifting his attention between the window and Maurice? \nKRIS You going on a trip Mr. Parker? \nMAURICE Yes. \nKRIS Where? \nMAURICE California. \nKris moves to the door. \nKRIS That's cool.  What day are you arriving? \nBeat. \nMAURICE I'm not sure -- sometime in January I think. \nKris stops cold.  The door to the street half-open. \nKRIS When are you leaving? \nMAURICE Tomorrow. \nKris is seriously confused now.  Maurice decides to end the confusion. \nMAURICE I'm walking there Kris. \nKRIS Walking where? \nMAURICE California. \nKris' jaw hits the floor as the bus pulls to a stop across the street.  Kris pulls up his sleeve and glances at his forearm. \nKRIS The hairs on my arm are standing up... Something strange is happening. \nMAURICE I always knew you had good instincts... (beat) Goodbye Kris.  I'll see you when I get back. \nKris hesitates before darting out of the store, across the street and into the bus.  Kris takes a seat in the back and digs into his bag and pulls out the tape recorder.  CLICK. \nKRIS Thursday, September 25... 'The Death Of A Spouse - Can It Drive You Insane?' \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  WYNNEWOOD PENNSYLVANIA - DAWN \nA BRILLIANT RED HUE BLANKETS THE HORIZON. \nThe suburbs come to life... Men and women leaving for work... School buses picking up their cargo of passengers... Store owners opening their businesses... \nCUT TO: \nPARKER BOOKS \nA group of eleven year old boys including the two kleptomaniacs we saw earlier, are standing before a closed door staring at a sign.  They look at each other before heading down the block. \nThe sign reads:  CLOSED - OWNER OUT OF TOWN. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  HOUSE - MORNING \nThe house is eerily silent. \nThree things lay on the dining table.  A shoulder bag filled with clothes.  A carrying bag with personals.  And a set of maps. \nMaurice checks the locks on all windows... He places all the food in the refrigerator into a trash bag... He pulls out a drawer and loosens a side panel, a wad of money flops out. Maurice pockets the bills... \nMaurice walks through the hall with a portable cage.  He stops before Claude's hanging cage... no movement, no chirping.  Maurice stares emotionally for a moment before reaching in and carefully removing CLAUDE'S LIFELESS BODY from the bottom of the cage.  Maurice looks down at the lost pet in his hands. \nMAURICE I know how you feel. \nThe neon MOTEL SIGN THROBS RED. \nSUPERIMPOSED across this image are the words: \nPHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA... MILE 26 \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  MOTEL - MORNING \nMaurice looks down the highway... eyes squinting to block out the sun.  The road winds and dissolves into the horizon... Maurice looks back the way he came -- a second of indecision... the moment passes. \nMaurice takes a deep breath before moving to the CRUSHED COKE CAN.  He moves to the exact spot where he left the road the night before and begins walking again... \nCUT TO: \nINT.  NEWSPAPER BUILDING - MORNING \nThe elevator BELL dings, letting off a cargo of newspaper personnel.  FRANK AND SETH are two of them.  They make their way to the desks... a sea of desks pressed against each other -- each desk has a computer. \nFrank and Seth come to their corner and stop before a young man, Phillies cap turned backwards, sitting behind an IBM 486 DX... fingers flying over the keyboard. \nFRANK Someone's got a hot story. \nSETH What time did you get in? \nKris Reddy keeps typing.  He spits out the answer after a few seconds. \nKRIS Five... Couldn't sleep. \nFRANK What's this one about Kris? 'Blinds or Curtains - The Eternal Question?' \nSETH No, no... 'Boxers Verses Tight Undies - The Battle Continues.' \nFrank and Seth crack up laughing.  Frank reaches for the printouts... Kris immediately covers them with his hand.  He stares up with a smile. \nKRIS Read about it on Sunday. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  STREET - DAY \nMaurice exits an athletic store in a small town.  On his feet a new pair of sneakers. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  STREET - DAY \nMaurice as he walks down a winding highway.  His new sneakers shuffling slowly. \nA SHARP PAIN SHOOTS UP MAURICE'S LEG.  His knees buckle.  The shoulder bags tumble to the ground followed by Maurice himself.  From a distance it looks like he's been shot. \nMaurice grabs the back of his thigh and tries to straighten his leg out... His face frozen in a painful expression. Maurice rubs his legs slowly -- working the cramp out.  He relaxes a bit as he finally straightens his leg.  Maurice sits there motionless -- eyes glazed... defeated. \nThe SOUNDS OF A BIRD snap him out of his trance.  He looks up to see a PAINTED BUNTING, a bird about six inches in height FLY DOWN from a tree and land on a rock next to him.  Maurice stares at the beautiful bird curiously.  Its body splashed with brilliant blues, reds and greens.  It looks out of place in these mundane surroundings.  Maurice looks around the skies to see no other birds.  The Painted Bunting chirps a few times before taking flight into the air.  It circles over Maurice before disappearing behind the trees. \nMaurice smiles.  He pulls himself to his feet with great effort. \nMaurice opens all of his bags and begins emptying the essentials -- the maps, food, a canister of water. \nMaurice reloads one bag and pulls it over his shoulder with great effort.  At his feet, are the rest of his belonging -- piled on the side of the road. \nMaurice painfully begins walking again. \nWE PULL BACK on Maurice's figure walking on the highway... the pile of disregarded things laying by the side... The highway is endless... winding it's way for miles and miles into a fixed dot in the distance. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  ADELLE'S HOUSE - MORNING \nSunrise on Pennsylvania.  Gerald picks the Philadelphia Gazette off the front porch. \nCUT TO: \nDINING ROOM \nGerald flips open the paper as he waits before an empty plate. \nGERALD Smells good, honey. \nCUT TO: \nKITCHEN \nAdelle puts the finishing touches on a stack of pancakes. She sets up two plates and brings them into the \nDINING ROOM \nGerald's eyes remain glued to the paper.  Adelle comes to the table, holding the golden pancakes over the table.  She notices the strange look on his face. \nADELLE What is it? \nGERALD Adelle... Maurice is in the paper. \nShe stares silently at the paper laid out on the table.  The headline beams at her: \nA PHILADELPHIA NATIVE'S LABOR OF LOVE \nROAD - DUSK \nIt's raining hard like gun-fire from the sky.  Maurice sits on the edge of a road rubbing his legs.  His hair matted to his head.  The rain pelts the ground in forceful waves. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nSUPPLY STORE \nAt a cash register, Maurice slaps ten more boxes of Ben-Gay down on the counter.  A teenage girl with braces looks at him like he's Charles Manson. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nMOTEL \nMaurice sleeps.  His barefeet are propped up on his bag.  His feet are swollen and red with fresh blisters.  A pack of ice is wrapped around his knee with an old shirt... The picture of Ellen clutched in his hand. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nROAD \nTwo joggers pass Maurice as he sees a flashing school sign. It is a suburban town.  The fallen red and orange leaves cover every flat surface. \nSUPERIMPOSE:  ELKHART, INDIANA... MILE 598 \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  SCHOOL - DAY \nA line of cars pulls around a semi-circle driveway.  Maurice watches as parents drop off their children.  A couple of ten year old boys walk by. \nBOY Nice sneaks. \nMaurice realizes they're talking to him. \nMAURICE They are? \nBOY 2 Sure man, High-Top Nike Cross Trainers with heel supports and air cushioned soles -- They're nasty. \nThe boys keep walking.  Maurice looks down at his sneakers with new-found pride. \nAfter a while, Maurice's attention switches back to the cars. One car in question catches Maurice's eye.  A woman consoles a small child who doesn't want to leave the car.  She wipes his tiny tears with her hand and hugs him tenderly.  The little boy's head cradled in her arms. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  FIFTEEN YEARS AGO - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) \nThe Parker house many years ago.  The house semi-furnished. Ellen carefully hangs her first bird photographs on the wall; a striking aerial photo of a GOLDEN EAGLE.  Wings spread, soaring high over a mountain range. \nMAURICE I thought we both wanted the same things. \nELLEN I've changed my mind. \nMAURICE You can't change your mind. \nBeat.  Ellen takes a seat on the only sofa. \nELLEN I want children. \nMAURICE You've just decided, is that right? \nELLEN Yes. \nYoung Maurice is visibly upset. \nMAURICE Ellen, there are two kinds of people in the world -- \nELLEN Please not, 'The two kinds of people' speech. \nMAURICE ... People that were made to be parents, and people who were not made to be parents... My parents, were people who were not made to be parents but had kids anyway.  I don't want us to be that way Ellen. \nELLEN You can change. \nMAURICE Face it Ellen, I'm not the type of person who reads bedtime stories. But you love me anyway. \nELLEN (upset) Don't be so sure. \nEllen fiddles with her dress.  She bites her bottom lip as she tries not to cry. \nELLEN (shaky voice) What if something happens to one of us?  We'll be all alone. \nMaurice loses his hard demeanor and moves next to her.  He lays his hand across her shoulder. \nMAURICE Nothing will happen to us.  It's a bleak picture, I know, but we're going to be together till were old and grey and you don't remember my name anymore. \nMaurice lifts her chin with his hand gently.  She blinks her eyes and a tear rolls down her cheek.  He takes a deep breath. \nMAURICE Let me think about it okay. \nEllen brightens up immediately. \nMAURICE I'm not saying anytime soon.  I'm just saying that maybe we can consider it down the road sometime. \nEllen gives her patented glowing smile.  She hugs him with all her strength.  She whispers in his ear. \nELLEN I love you Maurice Parker. \nCUT TO: \nMaurice is red with anger.  Denny loves it. \nDENNY Oh the preacher's getting angry again... (Denny goes ice cold) Tell me something.  Did she die instantly or did she feel every torn muscle and shattered bone? Were you there to help her?  Or were you safe at home when the windshield sliced into her face -- \nMAURICE I'll kill you! \nMaurice swings.  Denny easily avoids it.  Maurice doesn't see the first BLOW COMING, IT HITS HIM IN THE CHEST -- Maurice gasps for air as he buckles to the dirt.  Hands grab -- restrain.  A POWERFUL KICK IN THE RIBS -- ANOTHER... LAUGHTER... ANOTHER SET OF VICIOUS KICKS... The road and forest begin to spin... A PAINFUL SLASH ACROSS HIS FACE... \nMaurice prepares for the next blow... it never comes.  RED AND BLUE lights swirl... Maurice looks up, barely focusing -- a man leans over a car door... The image becomes clearer -- a POLICEMAN stands poised -- gun aimed directly at the men hovering over him. \nPOLICE OFFICER (distorted and slowed) Step away from him now! \nCUT TO: \nINT.  INDIANA POLICE STATION - EVENING \nOFFICER MERRIL GREY -- balances a phone on his shoulder as he spreads a new coat of mayonnaise on his hoagie. \nOFFICER GREY Need an I.D. check on a Maurice A. Parker... \nGrey reads Maurice's license. \nOFFICER GREY Driver's number 22 184 877... (listening) He was assaulted by a group of men just outside Elkhart, Indiana... \nCUT TO: \nINT.  PHILADELPHIA POLICE STATION - EVENING \nSergeant Dally, the officer Adelle spoke to earlier, listens on the other end of the phone his mouth agape. \nDALLY How is he?... That's good. \nGesturing to a young officer at another desk to come over. Dally, cups the phone. \nDALLY Call Adelle Matlin... tell her we found her uncle. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  PHILADELPHIA GAZETTE BUILDING - EVENING \nThe sea of desks are empty.  One empty desk is lit -- Kris Reddy's desk.  THE CRACKLE OF A SHORTWAVE/C.B. UNIT FLOATS THROUGH THE LARGE UNOCCUPIED ROOM from an adjacent room.  The VOICES OF DALLY AND OFFICER GREY ARE DISTORTED BUT AUDIBLE. \nWE MOVE TO the back room to find Kris writing furiously in front of an elaborate C.B. setup. \nHe jots down the words as fast as they're said: \n\"Maurice Parker... Elkhart... Route 80... Precinct 18...\" \nThe transmission gets cut as the phone conversation ends. Kris quickly rolls the chair across the room and grabs a map off the shelf. \nThe map gets pinned under two coffee cups and a ceramic frog as Kris traces the route from Philadelphia to Indiana... He sits up straight in astonishment as his eyes hit the KEY of the map. \nKRIS Jesus -- he's walked six hundred miles. \nKris glances at the hairs on his arm and smiles. \nCUT TO: \nLATER \nKris at his computer and in the 'zone.'  Fingers flying over the keys passionately.  On his desk is a cardboard box filled with letters all shapes and sizes on the verge of overflowing the top of the box.  One the side of the box are the words, \"Labor of Love - Fan Mail.\" \nCUT TO: \nINT.  INDIANA POLICE STATION - MORNING \nDAWN IN INDIANA -- the sun spills over the horizon. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  INDIANA POLICE STATION - MORNING \nMaurice and Officer Grey are seated on the front stairs of the precinct drinking coffee when ADELLE MATLIN DRIVES UP. \nAdelle steps out of a RENTED TOYOTA CELICA.  Her tense -- frightened eyes betray her mental state for the past ten hours.  She walks to the stairs. \nGREY Mrs. Matlin... good morning. \nMaurice slowly gets up.  Adelle is in shock as she looks at the stranger before her. \nMaurice stands in a 'COLTS' football T-shirt, faded jeans and sneakers.  His left cheek is black and blue, and his arm and side are bandaged. \nADELLE Uncle Maurice, you're wearing sneakers? \nMAURICE High-top Nike Cross-Trainers with heel support and air-cushioned soles.  They're nasty. \nAdelle wasn't sure what that meant.  She shakes it off and hugs Maurice.  She is visibly relieved to have him in her arms. \nGREY My shift ended an hour ago. \nAdelle notices the ROSE in Grey's hand.  Grey catches her glance. \nGREY It's for my wife. \nADELLE What's the occasion? \nGrey looks to Maurice -- they exchange a knowing smile. \nMaurice's dull eyes are about to shut when something catches his attention.  He sits up and stares out the window with great intensity.  Maurice watches as a large truck pulls into the parking lot, across it's side in blazing red -- \n\"Jackson Liquor Wholesalers - Since 1945\" \nMaurice scans the area... gas station ATTENDANTS... A BEARDED HOMELESS MAN laying next to a heating unit... KIDS eating fast food on old picnic tables... \nMaurice's gaze steadies on the TRUCK, as the driver fills the tank with gas. \nCUT TO: \nA PHONE BOOTH INSIDE THE CONVENIENCE STORE \nAdelle is on the phone. \nADELLE We'll figure everything out when we get there... Oh, he's going to need a lot of help with this... He wasn't even going to come with me, I had to tell him that he could do the walk later if he plans well... I know, but by that time I'll have gotten him some treatment... I just want to get back home before he changes his mind. \nCUT TO: \nCAR - LATER \nAdelle gets in the front seat of the car keeping the bag of food on the passenger seat.  She starts the car as she talks into the rearview mirror. \nADELLE You want something to eat? \nShe stares at Maurice covered in a blanket with his back to her... an unresponsive blob. \nADELLE I know you're feeling a lot of emotions right now.  It's okay to be mad.  It's okay to feel helpless.  It's part of the healing process.  I understand.  I do. \nAdelle puts the Celica into drive and pulls out onto the highway. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.  ADELLE'S HOUSE - EVENING \nEvening in Philadelphia.  The rented Toyota Celica pulls into the driveway.  The front door of the house opens.  Gerald walks out to greet them. \nA tired Adelle slips out of the car and hugs Gerald. \nADELLE He was exhausted -- slept the whole way. \nAdelle and Gerald move to the back door of the Celica.  They open it and stare at Maurice covered by the blanket.  Adelle shakes the blanket. \nADELLE Uncle Maurice we're home... Uncle Maurice. \nAdelle shakes Maurice, who stirs a little as he wakes.  His feet slide out from under the blanket -- Adelle stares curiously at the ARMY COMBAT BOOTS that dangle out. \nADELLE Uncle Maurice? \nAdelle pulls aside the covers... THE HOMELESS MAN, from the gas station, sits up.  ADELLE'S SHRILL SCREAM BLASTS THROUGH THE AIR.  Gerald and Adelle stumble back as the large, bearded man struggles out of the car and looks around the quiet neighborhood. \nHOMELESS MAN So this is the City of Brotherly Love. \nThe homeless man raises his hand.  He holds up MAURICE'S WELL POLISHED BOOK SOCIETY MEDALLION and kisses it lovingly. \nAdelle and Gerald stare back speechless. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.  ROAD - MORNING \nJACKSON WHOLESALER'S PARKING LOT.  The truck from the gas station, the only vehicle parked before the store. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  ROAD - MORNING \nMaurice back on the road.  His limp only slightly visible at this point in the day.  The bandages rubbing him with every step. \nThe highway takes him around a beautiful bend of trees.  THE AIR IS FILLED WITH THE SOUNDS OF BIRDS.  Maurice spots a YELLOW WARBLER, a striking bird about eight inches long with vivid yellow feathers.  It sits elegantly on a nearby branch. He walks towards it -- it stays in position.  Closer.  The bird chirps back at him.  Maurice is within arms reach of the bird. \nMAURICE Ellen would have loved you. \nMaurice looks closer -- and notices it's wings.  The feathers bend back -- a dark area at the center. \nMAURICE How did that happen? \nMaurice watches the bird hop around the branch -- unable to fly. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  PARKER KITCHEN - FIFTEEN YEARS EARLIER (FLASHBACK) \nThe kitchen is a different color.  The refrigerator and appliances are brand new.  Ellen walks in -- something cradled in her hand.  Maurice looks up from his paper to see Ellen move to the sink and lay a motionless bird on the counter. \nELLEN (shaky voice) It must've hit the window... I think its neck is broken. \nMAURICE Don't bring it in here -- it probably has all kinds of diseases. \nEllen finds an eye dropper from the table and fills it with water -- she lets a few drops fall into the birds mouth. \nCUT TO: \nBEDROOM \nEvening, just before bed.  Maurice is reading.  Ellen is monitoring the bird closely.  It lays on the bedside table -- wrapped gently with a hand towel.  A morsel of food is lowered into its mouth with a pair of tweezers.  The bird stares blankly at the ceiling. \nMAURICE It isn't going to make it Ellen. Let the poor thing go quietly. \nMaurice rests on an abandoned tractor by the side of the road and watches the wind change the fields.  He closes his jacket as the gusts become stronger. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nHOTEL \nThe clock clicks past 11:30 am.  Maurice is still in bed -- the curtains drawn.  He crawls out from under the sheets and downs two pills with a glass of water.  He looks bad.  His face pale, his eyes at half-mast.  He wipes unnatural sweat from his brow and melts into the bed again. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nSTREET \nJust after dusk.  A small town's main road.  Maurice quietly passes under the street lights. \nHe stares up and tightens the hood on his parka as the first SNOWFLAKE falls into the SHAFT OF THE STREET LIGHT.  Soon thousands of flakes fall into the light... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nGAZETTE BUILDING \nKris fields calls frantically as the LIGHTS BLINK ANXIOUSLY on his phone.  The front page of the Gazette is posted on his pin up board.  It reads... \"HE MARCHES ON...\"  Underneath is A PICTURE of Maurice standing outside his bookstore holding up THE BOOK SOCIETY MEDALLION proudly. \nA teenage boy gets off the elevator and maneuvers an enormous bag over his shoulder... emblazoned across his back are the words \"MAIL ROOM.\"  The boy comes to Kris and empties the bag on Kris' desk without a word.  Hundreds of letters cascade down swallowing the table top and covering Kris who stares in awe as the letters keep coming. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nMOTEL \nMaurice is COUGHING PAINFULLY.  He crouches over the edge of the bed and holds his side with every strain. \nMaurice looks worse than ever.  His hair and shirt are soaked with sweat.  The coughing attack stops.  Maurice take a couple deep breaths before laying back down. \nHis feet are visible -- sticking out from beneath the sheets. They look like someone has beaten them with a stick, swollen and bruised.  They disappear under the sheets. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nSNOW COVERED ROADS \nthat stretch into a white oblivion. \nSUPERIMPOSE:  ELM CREEK, NEBRASKA... MILE 1,564 \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  STREET - DAY \nEarly morning.  The branches of the trees are encapsulated in ice.  The snow piled ten inches on every surface.  Maurice, buried deep beneath three layers of clothes, looks around. His breath materializes with every step.  He forces a weak smile at the magical landscape before him.  White.  Pure. Peaceful. \nThe SOUNDS OF A VOLVO STATION WAGON urges Maurice to the side of the road.  As it passes a little girl waves from the passenger window.  Maurice puts on a brave face and waves back. \nAnother CAR ENTERS the picture -- A DARK BLUE FIREBIRD rises over the hill in the opposite lane moving fast, too fast. \nSLOW-MOTION as the Firebird skids over the ice and the snow -- the driver desperately trying to gain control... The mother in the Volvo hits the BRAKES as the Firebird spins into her lane... Maurice yells out. \nMAURICE No! \nThe cars IMPACT with a sickening CRUNCH -- BACK TO REAL TIME: \nThe Firebird spins into a guardrail, breaking through it and coming to a stop in a bank of snow. \nThe Volvo isn't so lucky.  It flips from the impact... sliding on its roof, driving through the snow, down the road... It comes to a rest a hundred feet away. \nSILENCE.  STILLNESS.  The entire event took only seconds. \nMaurice runs frantically after the Volvo.  The windows are SHATTERED.  Snow has packed into the over-turned car.  No one can be seen inside the vehicle. \nMaurice kneels down and punctures the wall of snow with his hand.  His arm disappears up to the shoulder.  His face grimacing with the strain.  His arm comes out slowly... \nA few MUFFLED SOBS ARE HEARD BEFORE the little girl breaks through the wall of snow and slides out of the window.  She lets out a DESPERATE GASP for air as Maurice pulls her out by the wrist. \nMaurice clears her mouth and face and watches as she coughs. \nMAURICE (panting) It's okay.  It's all over. \nMaurice lays her gently against a snow bank, before moving to the other side of the car. \nDRIVER (O.S.) Is she okay? \nMaurice looks up to see the driver of the Firebird walking towards him.  He looks dazed. \nMaurice doesn't waste another second and plunges his arm in the snow... deeper than before.  His cheek pressed against the snow, almost laying flat on the ground. \nMAURICE (frantic) Oh no... she's wearing a seat-belt. \nMaurice fishes around... his teeth clenched... He lets out a POWERFUL GRUNT as he pulls back with all his strength -- a woman's WRIST appears first, then the tangled hair and then the body spills out onto the road next to Maurice. \nThe driver appears over the Woman and Maurice and loses it when he sees them. \nDRIVER It wasn't my fault.  It wasn't my fault. \nMaurice, out of breath, clears the woman's face and mouth -- no movement.  No sound. \nMAURICE Come on... please... \nMaurice holds her nose and breaths into her mouth... \nMAURICE Please... \nThat makes Tandy think. \nHANSEN If he's clean, he'll never know about it. \nTandy looks to the men's bathroom door. \nTANDY Do it quick. \nHansen instantly reaches over and begins rummaging through the shoulder bag.  Hansen pulls out a little folder.  He opens the folder to reveal an old certificate.  Hansen shows Tandy the worn piece of paper. \nHANSEN A marriage certificate?  Who the hell carries their marriage certificate around? \nTANDY Maurice and Ellen Parker... it was issued in Philly... Mr. Maurice Parker has come a long way from home.  Why? \nHansen returns the certificate and folder to the bag and leaves the booth quickly. \nCUT TO: \nLATER \nMaurice returns to the table to find only Tandy seated. Maurice sees Hansen in the phone booth at the far end of the diner. \nTANDY Hansen's whipped.  Has to call his wife every two hours or she'll go ballistic when he gets home. \nCUT TO: \nPHONE BOOTH \nHANSEN P-A-R-K-E-R.  Right.  Get on the horn with Philly.  Call me here. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  PHILADELPHIA POLICE STATION - EVENING \nSergeant Dally packs his things to leave.  He sees the light on LINE 1 LIGHT UP on his phone.  He ignores it.  The clerk sticks her head around the corner. \nCLERK Line one Sarg. \nDALLY I'm not here. \nDally zips his coat. \nCLERK It's the Nebraska state police. \nDALLY Nebraska? \nCLERK You know somebody named -- Maurice Parker? \nDally freezes.  He shakes his head as he unzips his jacket. \nDALLY (smiles) That son of a bitch made it to Nebraska. \nDally grabs the phone. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  GAZETTE BUILDING - EVENING \nThe C.B. CRACKLES WITH THE VOICE OF SERGEANT DALLY AND THE NEBRASKA POLICE. \nMICHELLE, a very introverted intern, stares at the radio astonished. \nCUT TO: \nA SMALL SIDE OFFICE \nIt now has \"KRIS REDDY\" etched on it's door.  Kris looks up from his desk at Michelle who stands in the doorway bright red. \nKRIS What is it? \nMichelle just points down the hall. \nCUT TO: \nOFFICE \nMichelle scribbles down notes. \nC.B./NEBRASKA POLICE ... He saved a little girl, and her mother.  Pulled them right out of the car... \nKris stands, jaw hanging wide open. \nKRIS Where is he? \nMichelle checks her notes. \nMICHELLE (very soft voice) Umm, Elm Creek, Nebraska. \nKris practically falls over.  Michelle scribbles down more quotes. \nMICHELLE This story is big huh? \nKRIS Mammoth. \nMICHELLE The Gazette's small huh? \nBeat. \nMAURICE Thank you... I'm sorry you had to lie.  It must have been difficult. \nFATHER I asked the officers if you had committed some crime... If they had said 'yes', you would be speaking with them right now. \nThis is the father's own room.  Very sparse as one would expect.  He moves to his bureau and retrieves some pills. \nFATHER Take these, and if you're up to it, try to explain how it is you came to be sitting here. \nMaurice follows the father's instructions and tightens the blanket around his shoulders. \nMAURICE I'm walking for my wife. \nBeat. \nFATHER To where? \nMAURICE Pacifica, California. \nFATHER From where? \nMAURICE Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. \nFATHER I see. \nBeat.  The father nods as if this is not shocking news. \nFATHER Why? \nMAURICE Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death? \nFATHER Most certainly. \nMAURICE And that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them. \nFATHER That's a reasonable assumption. \nMAURICE I don't want my wife's soul having any doubts. \nFATHER Doubts?  About what? \nMAURICE About my love for her. \nThe father nods with understanding as if everything became very clear with that statement. \nFATHER You don't have to prove anything to her. \nMAURICE I'm not proving to her.  I'm showing her.  And I know I don't have to.  I want to.  I've realized, love is about giving. I'm alive, I can still give to her. I want to give her everything I can. \nThe father studies this stranger before him with great admiration. \nMAURICE There are some people, including those officers, that are trying to stop me.  They mean well.  But they don't understand.  I wouldn't either if I were them. \nMaurice struggles with the last words.  He slumps back -- physically drained. \nThe father gets up and takes the empty glass of water from Maurice's hands. \nFATHER I want you to stay here a few days until you're better.  You're no use to your wife in this condition. \nThe father moves for the curtain. \nMAURICE You think I'm crazy too. \nThe father turns and smiles warmly. \nFATHER I have spent my life dedicated to love.  Love of God.  Love of humanity.  And here you are living through love.  Bathing in it. Using its strength, its magic, its ability to overcome any barrier... If you are crazy, I hope my insanity is not far off. \nMaurice's eyes well up instantly. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  CHURCH - WESTERN HIGHWAY - DAY \nFather Berchman wraps one powerful hand around a tiny silver cross dangling from his neck.  The other hand waves high into the air at the shrinking figure of Maurice Parker walking through the snow. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nHIGHWAY \nThe long trek continues.  The black tar of the roads peek out in spots as the SUN BEATS down on the flatlands.  Maurice drapes his worn scarf around a melting snowman. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nRESTAURANT \nWe are looking inside a fancy Center-City Philadelphia restaurant.  Adelle and Gerald are seated by an enormous bay window.  A waiter comes to their table with their main course.  Gerald watches the food being served with great anticipation. \nGerald's eyes drift out the window to the magazine stand on the sidewalk... He squints to see better.  Realization hits hard... His eyes light up.  He looks to Adelle and back to the magazine stand. \nIn a mad race for time, Gerald begins to devour the food on his plate.  The waiter and Adelle watch him in shock.  Adelle glances out the window.  Her eyes squint... then light up. She jumps to her feet and grabs Gerald by the arm, a fork full of food drops to his plate.  Gerald looks back at his full plate longingly as Adelle pulls him out of the restaurant. \nThe waiter looks out the window to the magazine stand.  He squints. \nCUT TO: \nMAGAZINE STAND \nThe NEW YORK TIMES are hung like stockings around the border of the stand.  On the front pages, a singular headline stands out among the others: \nMaurice looks at her oddly.  MR. CALDWELL comes to the door; his face lights up. \nMRS. CALDWELL This is Maurice Parker -- the one walking for his wife. \nMr. Caldwell is completely floored.  So, for that matter is Maurice.  Mr. Caldwell puts out his hand with awe. \nMR. CALDWELL If that ain't fate?... Hi, I'm Dave Caldwell.  I do the copy for the anchor on the evening news down here. \nMAURICE Evening News? \nMR. CALDWELL We did a piece after your story ran in the New York Times. \nMaurice is truly surprised. \nMAURICE New York Times? \nMrs. Caldwell ushers Maurice in the doorway by the elbow. \nMRS. CALDWELL Someone said they spotted you in town... Mr. Parker, you're a celebrity. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CALDWELL KITCHEN - NIGHT \nThe Caldwell family dinner... all twelve of them.  Ten children talk and reach for food.  Maurice sits at the end talking, enjoying and sharing.  Isaac sits next to him proudly.  Maurice has blended in as another member of this family. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CALDWELL GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT \nAn inviting room.  The kind prepared for visiting grandmothers and grandfathers to stay in. \nMaurice checks himself out in the mirror... his borrowed pajamas fit nicely. \nHe moves to the window and stares at the moon lit landscape... enormous, endless, dwarfing. \nThe rocking chair CREAKS as Maurice melts into it.  He rubs his calves slowly, the pain evident in his face.  His head leans back after a moment... on the verge of sleep. \nThe SOUND OF TINY FOOTSTEPS stirs him.  He looks to the doorway to find Isaac standing quietly at the door in his baseball P.J.s. \nMAURICE I thought you were asleep. \nISAAC You know what... I remembered you were here and I woke up. \nIsaac walks silently to Maurice... Tip-toeing all the way. \nMAURICE Your parents would want you to be in bed. \nISAAC You tell stories? \nMAURICE Oh no... I'm not good at that. Very bad in fact... \nToo late.  Isaac climbs up into Maurice's lap with great effort.  Maurice looks down at Isaac who waits patiently for him to begin. \nMAURICE I would be exceedingly boring. \nIsaac waits. \nMAURICE I don't do these type of things. \nIsaac -- still waiting. \nMAURICE See there are two kinds of people in this world. (beat) ... Just a short one okay? \nIsaac gets in position, cradled in Maurice's arms.  Maurice searches for something to say. \nMAURICE There was a boy named Isaac who wanted to play baseball, but he was too small and no one would let him play... but he kept practicing by himself -- waiting... He went to every game and sat in the stands with his glove. \nISAAC You know what... maybe I ran onto the field and hit a home run. \nMAURICE Who's telling this story? \nIsaac points to Maurice. \nMAURICE Good, now the team had this great big player -- Big Billy.  He was the best.  He had them in the World Super-Bowl-Championship of little kids baseball.  But right before the game, the second best player on the team was suspended because he played a prank on a nice man who owned a book store... When that boy grew up he was convicted on burglary charges and spent fifteen years in prison -- where he belongs. \nIsaac didn't understand that last part. \nMAURICE Anyway, Big Billy needed another player so he yelled into the stands.  'Who can play baseball?' And there was a little voice that yelled out, 'Me, I can play.' Everyone turned to see a little boy standing with a glove. \nISAAC (beaming) That's me. \nMAURICE Right.  But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  It came to the end of the game.  It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game... \nISAAC Nine. \nMAURICE Okay nine.  Big Billy's team was losing and he was on base.  That's when Isaac came up.  He could barely hold the bat... Big Billy winked at Isaac... The ball was pitched -- Isaac hit the ball hard. It soared up and out over the stadium.  Everyone cheered.  Isaac hit a home run and won the game. After the game, Isaac asked Big Billy why he let he play.  Big Billy smiled and said, I wasn't always Big Billy, I was Little Billy first... Isaac and Big Billy went off after the game and read a classic book together.  The end. \nISAAC You know what -- that was a really good story... Tell it again. \nMaurice has to smile as Isaac looks up anxiously. \nMAURICE There was a boy named Isaac who liked to play baseball... \nWE BACK OUT as Maurice rocks back and forth in his chair. Isaac falling asleep in his arms. \nCUT TO: \nMaurice's face filled with strength.  He grins through the pain. \nMAURICE I'm fine. \nDRIVER What the hell are you doing out here?  You need a ride somewhere? \nMAURICE No thank you. \nThe driver is concerned.  He opens the driver door. \nDRIVER You by yourself? \nBeat. \nMAURICE No. \nThis pacifies the driver somewhat.  He nods and gets in the car.  Maurice watches as the car pulls away. \nHe turns back to the guardrail -- the eagle is gone.  Maurice looks up into the sky.  The Golden Eagle is flying overhead... a tiny dot against the blazing sun. \nMaurice struggles to his feet using the guardrail as support. Maurice takes his first step... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.  SUBURBAN STREET - DAY \nSuburbia.  Rows of similar houses with small lawns and custom mailboxes.  Beautiful trees line the streets creating a canopy over the roadway. \nTwo women sit on a swing on the front porch of a small suburban home.  JANIS AND AMMIE'S conversation is cut in mid sentence. \nJANIS Who is that? \nAMMIE I don't know.  What's the matter with him? \nJanis and Ammie stare to the street where a sunburnt MAURICE staggers in a daze. \nMAURICE'S POV \nMaurice is on the edge of darkness... the trees and faces swimming -- mixed with the colors of red and blue cloth waving in the wind... Images come in and out of focus... two women walking towards him... Maurice clutches his head as the trees start to swim faster -- color, lights, houses... \nDISSOLVING TO BLACK: \nMaurice collapses in the middle of this suburban street. Janis and Ammie run to his side. \nSUPERIMPOSED:  \"ROSEVILLE, CALIFORNIA... MILE 3,205\" \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT.  HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY \nMaurice lays still on a hospital bed.  His eyes slowly force themselves open. \nNURSE (O.S.) Good morning Mr. Parker. \nMaurice turns his head to the side.  A pretty woman in her late twenties, with LARGE LOCKS OF BROWN HAIR smiles back. This is STEPHANIE. \nSTEPHANIE There are a lot of people worried about you. \nMAURICE (softly) Where am I? \nSTEPHANIE In a hospital. \nMAURICE Which hospital?  Did you take me back? \nStephanie understands his worry. \nSTEPHANIE You are in St. Vincent's Hospital in Roseville California.  You've been here three days. \nMaurice closes his eyes in relief. \nMAURICE Thank God. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  HOSPITAL - AFTERNOON \nThe room is crowded.  Maurice is now propped up in a seated position.  He tries to digest a set of fish sticks on a tray. \nMAURICE I can't believe you're here.  I'm touched. \nMaurice looks across to ADELLE AND GERALD. \nMAURICE Are you two planning kids? \nADELLE Maybe later. \nMAURICE You should definitely have children.  They're really special. \nAdelle and Gerald are in shock.  Maurice forks another fish stick with a smile. \nADELLE I don't think you realize how serious this is Uncle. \nMAURICE How serious is it? \nDR. RAY, who has been standing by the window listening, steps forward. \nDR. RAY You have two broken ribs, a punctured spleen and Acute Rheumatoid Arthritis. \nMAURICE My wife is dead. \nMaurice continues his powerful gaze until Clive looks away. Clive gathers his things and leaves the chapel without another word.  Maurice drops his head into his hands and cries quietly. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT \nA change of shifts.  Stephanie gathers her things.  She lifts her coat off the counter.  Underneath is a paper.  She spins the paper to face her.  The headline reads, \"The End of a Journey - Parker Hospitalized.\" \nCUT TO: \nHOSPITAL ROOM \nStephanie peeks into the dark room. \nSTEPHANIE (whispers) Good night Mr. Parker.  I'll see you tomorrow. \nStephanie waits for a response from the motionless figure on the bed.  She leaves the room a little disappointed. \nWE MOVE CLOSER TO THE BED.  We see Maurice laying still -- the battered photo of Ellen clutches to his chest. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  HOSPITAL HALL - DAY \nStephanie is wheeling Maurice down the hall.  Maurice has a glint of happiness in his eye.  They move through the doors marked \"Visitor's Area.\" \nMaurice stretches a huge grin as KRIS REDDY gets up from a chair.  Kris bends down and hugs Maurice emotionally. \nKRIS Tom Joad? \nMAURICE ... The Grapes of Wrath. \nKRIS You're amazing. \nCUT TO: \nLATER \nMaurice and Kris seated in the corner of the room. \nMAURICE I missed you Kris. \nKRIS I missed you to Mr. Parker. \nMAURICE Adelle told me, your writing is going well.  The Crusader for social issues and all. \nKRIS You were right.  From the heart is always better. \nBeat. \nKRIS I drove by the bookstore -- it's boarded up now.  There's a sign over the wood -- \"Office space available.\" \nThe loss is evident on Maurice's eyes. \nMAURICE I haven't been too punctual with the rent. \nKRIS I was thinking you could open another store with investors.  I'm sure a lot of people would want to get involved with you now. \nMaurice forces a smile. \nMAURICE Actually, I'm not worried about my career right now... I'm more worried about how you're getting me out of here? \nBeat.  Kris glances at the hair on his forearm. \nMAURICE Are they standing? \nKRIS (running his hand over his arm) Saluting. \nBeat. \nKRIS Come on Mr. Parker. \nMAURICE What, come on? \nKRIS I can't do it.  I want you to finish, but I want you to live more. \nMaurice sits back straight.  He looks upset. \nMAURICE We do the operation after I finish. I can't risk not finishing... I thought you understood what I was doing. \nKRIS I do. \nMAURICE Why in God's name did you fly all the way here then? \nKRIS Don't do this. \nMAURICE ... To look me in the eye and say what's important to you isn't as important to me?  To tell me you know what's best?  To tell me life is more precious than what I feel for my wife? \nKris gets very emotional.  He rises from this chair. \nKRIS Mr. Parker, you can yell at me, if it'll help.  But I'm not risking your life. \nMAURICE It's mine to risk. \nMaurice turns to the window away from Kris. \nA colorful canopy of leaves... a familiar torn American flag. Stephanie's white VW Rabbit pulls to a stop. \nMAURICE This is it... This is where I fell. \nHe turns back to Stephanie who stares back at him emotionally. \nSTEPHANIE I never thanked my father.  He did so much for me... I never thanked him. \nMaurice holds her sad face in his scared hands. \nMAURICE (whispering) It's not too late. \nMaurice gets out of the car painfully slow.  He pulls his shoulder back upright with a laborious breath.  A sense of pride returns to his face.  He turns back to Stephanie and catches a horrified look.  He follows her stare... \nShe is staring at his shirt... He looks down to see a DARK CRIMSON STAIN GROWING beneath the surface.  He covers the area with his hand. \nMAURICE You're going to have a lot of work to do when I get back. \nSTEPHANIE Someone should be with you. \nBeat. \nMAURICE Someone is. \nHe gives her his best smile and begins shuffling his feet over the loose gravel of the road... one step at a time. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  HOSPITAL STAIRS - AFTERNOON \nA black man -- grey, balding hair walks hurriedly up the stairs.  This is STAN NEWTON. \nKeeping in step with Newton is a police officer.  SERGEANT EMORY, jet white hair, army cut, gives him an intimidating appearance. \nCUT TO: \nOUTSIDE DOOR \nNewton stops Emory before entering. \nNEWTON I'm afraid Mrs. Matlin is very upset. \nEmory lets the warning sink in before opening the door. Adelle's VOICE IS BOOMING. \nCUT TO: \nHOSPITAL ROOM \nAdelle YELLS at Dr. Ray, a few nurses, and the guard who was on duty. \nADELLE ... \"American Journal of Psychology\", \"Psychological Review\", and \"Science\", so I think it's safe to say my opinion is valid. \nShe catches her breath. \nADELLE How does a grown man who can barely walk, just stroll out?... This is not James Bond here, this is my uncle who owns a bookstore, and gets outwitted by grade school kids pulling pranks! \nAdelle notices the new people in the room. \nNEWTON Mrs. Matlin, this is Sergeant Emory.  He'll help us find your uncle. \nAdelle walks up to Emory. \nADELLE Let me tell you a story Sergeant. There was a patient of mine who had a Golden Retriever, Mac... She loved Mac, not like a pet, but like a family member.  One day, she had to leave Mac with 'friends', and wouldn't you know it, Mac gets away and ends up falling into a sewer. My patient comes back -- goes nuts when she hears that Mac has been in the sewer for over 48 hours. Apparently the cop who found the dog didn't want to get his pants dirty.  And neither did anyone else.  So of course, my patient decides to go in after it... she falls... breaks her hip and lands next to her dead dog, who died of toxic fumes down there... \nAdelle looks around at all the engrossed faces. \nADELLE The moral of the story is... She sued for a lot of money!  She sued the friends, the city, and the officer for negligence on duty. She has no Mac, no happiness, but she's very rich now... That was a dog.  We're talking about a human being... (beat) I hope everyone clearly understands the chain of events that will occur if something should happen to my uncle, whom I love more than you can possibly imagine... Now Sergeant I would like to know right now, if you're willing to get your pants dirty for my uncle? \nAdelle and Emory have a staring contest.  Adelle wins. Adelle stands alone in a room with four men, and she is clearly the one in charge. \nThe door flies open.  A police officer walks in pushing KRIS REDDY through the door. \nOFFICER I found him sneaking up the back stairs with this. \nThe officer holds out a long coat and hat.  Emory walks up to Kris. \nEMORY Did you help Mr. Parker leave this hospital? \nKris looks to the empty bed and smiles... a BIG SMILE. \nKRIS No... But I was going to. \nBeat.  Emory turns to the officer and ushers him to the door. \nEMORY Forget him.  It's time to get our pants dirty. \nAdelle smiles. \nEMORY I want three black and whites from here to Handley Avenue.  And no communication with the station. The press monitors the transmissions. \nKRIS (a born actor) They can do that? \nEMORY That goes for all of you.  Not a word about this disappearance to anyone.  Absolutely no press. \nKris smiles innocently. \nCUT TO: \nYOUNG MAN Go Mr. Parker! \nCars start to HONK... More and more people turn to see the commotion... The YELLING AND HONKING IS JOINED BY WHISTLES AND CHEERS -- \nMaurice can't believe it -- he tries to smile but can't hold it.  His face tightens with every step.  His shirt is soiled with blood.  He raises his hand and gives a weak wave to a woman who holds up her little boy through the sunroof of the car. \nCUT TO: \nA WCAU NEWS VAN \nparked in the traffic.  A NEWSREPORTER stares through binoculars. \nREPORTER Thank you God! \nThe crew quickly prepares their cameras and equipment.  They move like lightning.  In seconds they are shooting the crowd and their hero. \nThe air is CHARGED... THE NOISE GROWING, MORE AND MORE PEOPLE JOIN IN... LOUDER... People stand on top of their cars to get a better view... \nCUT TO: \nA POLICE CAR \nstuck in traffic.  OFFICER DAWSON looks around as the PARADE OF NOISE SURGES TOWARDS HIM.  He looks out his window and catches a GLIMPSE OF MAURICE LIMPING UP THE FREEWAY. \nDAWSON Sweet Jesus! \nCUT TO: \nINT.  POLICE STATION - DAY \nOfficer Klein busts into Emory's office just as Adelle is about to leave. \nKLEIN They found him. \nAdelle is instantly charged with life. \nKLEIN Dawson's on the C.B. -- wants to talk with you Sarg. \nCUT TO: \nRADIO ROOM \nAdelle and as many officers that will fit in the room are listening to the radio conversation. \nEMORY What's going on?  Where is he? \nEmory CLICKS TO LISTEN.  THE SPEAKERS EXPLODE WITH HONKING AND CHEERING -- IT SOUNDS LIKE A CARNIVAL.  DAWSON YELLS OVER THE COMMOTION. \nDAWSON (V.O.) He's just getting off 280.  It's amazing Sarg... everybody's out of their cars and cheering him on. \nEMORY Shit, get him in your car and take him to St. Vincents. \nBeat. \nDAWSON (V.O.) You ever see that concert footage of the Doors, Sarg? \nAdelle and the room of officers look confused. \nEMORY What the hell are you talking about? \nDAWSON (V.O.) The Doors, the musical group.  I saw a documentary where the police stopped one of their concerts, snatched Jim Morrison right off the stage... the crowd went frickin nuts -- they tore up the place -- it turned into a war. (beat) ... I'm not stopping this concert by myself.  And there's no way you're getting backup here -- it's jammed up for miles. \nEmory is thinking fast. \nDAWSON (V.O.) Why don't we just let him finish Sarg? \nBeat.  Emory looks at Adelle's expectant face.  He talks into the C.B. without taking his eyes off her. \nEMORY How does he look? \nDAWSON (V.O.) Like shit.  He's bleeding heavily. He's having breathing problems and he's as pale as stone.  If he wasn't moving, I'd swear he was dead. \nEmory thinks.  He talks to the other officers in the room. \nEMORY Bring him in.  Now!  If he dies out there, who the hell knows what that crowd will do... (to himself) Let alone the Mayor. \nThe room empties fast.  Emory talks to Adelle. \nEMORY He'll be in a hospital within a half an hour. \nSomehow, Adelle's face doesn't convey much confidence. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  PACIFICA MALL - DAY \nThe shops are empty.  The food court abandoned. \nClose to five hundred people are huddled at the center of the mall.  The HI-FI HOUSE has four large screen TV's in their bay windows and speakers on the outside of the doors to lure passing shoppers in. \nAll four sets have the same program on -- A NEWSBREAK on Maurice Parker.

People in the crowd cover their mouths in shock as they get a clear view of him... His shirt soaked on one side with blood, his entire body shaking with pain, and exhaustion, his face hollow and pale -- ghostly. \nMaurice stops in his tracks.  He looks up at a wooden sign, worn from the years of salt water air.  The sign reads: \n\"PACIFICA BEACH - 1/2 MILE\" \nMaurice's thoughts fade away from this place, this time... \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  PHILADELPHIA - FIFTEEN YEARS AGO - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) \nWE ARE IN THE PARKER BEDROOM.  The lights are off.  The MOONLIGHT FROM THE WINDOWS BLANKETS Young Maurice and Young Ellen as they lay in bed.  Ellen is cradled in Maurice's arms.  She is awake and watching the shadows dance on the ceiling.  She speaks in whispers. \nELLEN What do you think heaven is like? \nMaurice opens his eyes and stares at his beautiful wife. \nMAURICE I don't know. \nELLEN I think it's a different place for each person. \nMAURICE Did you have a dream? \nBeat. \nELLEN I know where my heaven is. \nMAURICE Where? \nELLEN Pacifica, California. \nMaurice chuckles. \nMAURICE Why there? \nELLEN When I was ten, my family lived in Pacifica for a year.

That's where my heaven will be. \nBeat. \nELLEN Maurice? \nMAURICE Yes. \nELLEN If I die, you'll know where to look for me? \nMAURICE Go to sleep Ellen. \nELLEN No really, if God takes us away from each other, you know where to look now? \nBeat. \nMAURICE (pacifying her) The beach of Pacifica, California. \nELLEN Good. \nBeat. \nMAURICE Go to sleep Ellen. \nEllen smiles as she cradles deeper into Maurice's arms.

He whispers in her ear. \nMAURICE Why do you put up with me? \nBeat. \nELLEN Love... has something to do with it. \nMaurice reaches over and turns off the stove.  He then turn Ellen around and kisses her long and hard.  Ellen pulls away gently and stares into his eyes.

A SET OF TUBE LIGHTS FLICKER TO LIFE. \nCARL STONE leads Maurice out to the main room which is presently a cob-web infested, barren space with a few discarded packing boxes left in the corners. \nMaurice runs his fingertips against the wall. \nMAURICE History and the arts will be here... \nHis hand makes a grand swirl pointing to another area.  He says the next two words with great awe as if he was saying something holy. \nMAURICE The Classics... \nCarl watches curiously as Maurice walks around in a trance. He moves to the bay window that over looks the street. \nMAURICE We'll have a hand-painted sign... (another grand swirl) ... Parker Books. \nMaurice's already bright eyes, brighten even more as he spots the security guard strolling up and down the front of the jewelry store.  The guard catches his stare and waves.

OFFICE ROOM - AFTERNOON \nWe are in Carl's cramped upstairs office... just enough room to walk amongst the file cabinets. \nMaurice holds his pen over the documents before him. \nMAURICE I wish my wife were here.

We invited some friends over -- you see, for a celebration. \nCarl smiles patiently, he's seen this before. \nMaurice gathers his strength as he puts pen to paper...

The SOUNDS OF LIGHT CONVERSATION float through the room.  About ten friends and family have gathered. \nMaurice sits on the sofa nearest the window.  He's listening to the drone of TED PRICE. \nEllen is not present. \nTED ... So she says the \"L\" word, after two dates, the \"L\" word!  She says 'Don't you believe in true love? Love that can conquer all?'  I say, 'Whoa, hold on.  Just so we're clear on things, I think love these days is shit.  It don't mean a thing and it don't stand for nothing.  Shit.'... You know what she says, 'Fine, but how do you feel about kids?' \nEveryone near the SOFA LAUGHS.  A CAR LIGHT DANCES ON THE CURTAINS... Maurice quickly pulls the curtain aside and watches as the car pulls past the house and around the corner.  Maurice turns back from the window hiding his concern and without missing a beat... \nMAURICE It's nice to see you don't have any scars from your divorce. \nThis brings on another ROUND OF LAUGHTER. \nTHE TELEPHONE RINGS. \nMaurice rises from his seat -- but is waved off by ADELLE MATLIN who picks up the phone right away.  Adelle is Maurice's niece, early thirties, very attractive and always smiling -- except at this moment. \nTed begins another one of his stories -- the words are incoherent as Maurice watches Adelle carefully... Adelle turns her back to the room as she talks and then DISAPPEARS into the kitchen stretching the phone cord around the doorway... Something is definitely wrong. \n", "test1_true": "Maurice watches Adelle move to her husband GERALD and whispers in his ear.

A dread hangs over every passing second... Gerald crumbles under the moment... Adelle begins to cry. \nGERALD There was a car accident... Drunk driver. \nSome of the crowd reacts.  A women covers her mouth.  The moment is unbearable. \nMAURICE (to himself) Please God -- don't do this. \nGerald cracks -- the tears start to flow from his eyes. \nGERALD Maurice, it was serious... I don't know how to -- \nGerald buries his face into the heels of his palms as if trying to contain an explosion in his head. \nGERALD Oh Jesus, please help me... She didn't... Ellen didn't make it... Ellen's dead Maurice. \nMaurice closes his eyes shut tightly... like a child scared of the dark. \nAdelle blacks out, knocking over the wine chiller on the way to the ground.  In less than a minute the room has transformed from a celebration to a mourning.  Everyone is frozen staring at Maurice for their cue...

Maurice stares at the collection of hanging dresses. \nHe reaches out and pulls the cloth of a floral dress towards him... He closes his eyes and smells the cloth... his face tightens in pain... both hands cling to the dress tightly... he tries desperately, can't fight it -- Maurice Parker begins to cry. \nHis hands grab frantically at the rest of the dresses -- pressing them to his face and chest. \nMAURICE Oh God... I'm sorry Ellen... I'm so sorry... \nHe hugs the dresses as if they were her.  His weeping turns to a torturous wail of grief... all the love, all the anger spilling out in this one moment. \nHe falls to the ground yanking all the dresses down with him -- they collapse atop him...

I never really showed her. \nBeat. \nKRIS I'm really lost.  What does this have to do with walking? \nMAURICE I said, 'I would do anything for her'... and she didn't believe me. I said, 'I'd walk across the country for her'... she didn't believe me. \nMaurice looks to Kris rolling along beside him.  He sees the worried expression on his face. \nMAURICE I need to show her how much I love her Kris. \nKRIS Why know? \nMAURICE Because I should have shown her before...

He's breathing heavy as he moves up a steep incline by the side of the road.  His feet slide on the loose dirt.  Maurice looks like he could collapse at any moment. \nHe makes it to the indentation in the hillside -- just enough room to lay down in the shade.  Maurice lays out slowly.  He pries off his sneakers, band-aids and blisters cover every inch of his feet.  Maurice dumps the sand out of his sneakers and painfully pulls them back on.  His eyes close as he tries to unbutton his jacket... too late he's asleep. \nMaurice's bed is a rock that juts from the side of the hill... First WE SEE nothing, then some grains of sand escape from the crack where the rock meets the hillside.  The CRACK BECOMES SLIGHTLY LARGER -- PULLING AWAY FROM THE HILL BY A FRACTION OF AN INCH.  It stabilizes there. \nMaurice unaware of his precarious situation sleeps twenty five feet above the ground. \nCUT TO: \nMID-DAY \nAnother sizzler.  Temperatures in the nineties.

Feet and hands desperately trying to cling to the hillside... He picks up speed as he tumbles down... Maurice looks down in time to see a small jut in the rock hurtling towards him... no time for panic... SLAM!  A SICKENING CRACK OF BONE as Maurice HITS the rock square in the ribs... Maurice flops down the rest of the slope like a rag doll... he comes to rest in the dirt, clutching his ribs.  The sun beats down on his stunned eyes. \nMaurice stares up at the dizzying slope.  Sand still trickling down to a stop.  He doesn't try to move for the first few seconds.  His breathing increasingly erratic. \nMaurice drags himself to sit upright.  The sharp pains causing a distorted grimace on his face.  A short rest, before working his way to his feet. \nCUT TO: \nHIGHWAY \nMaurice uses a highway guardrail as a backrest.  He takes a seat in the dirt.  Maurice's hair is damp with sweat.  His breathing relegated to slow gasps.  His left hand covering his rib cage protectively.  Blood begins to trickle through the spaces between his fingers. \nMaurice closes his eyes for a moment, before his bent leg goes into spasms... Maurice is forced to straighten the leg instantly... jarring his tender rib cafe... Maurice clings to the back of his thigh... Maurice is defeated... On the verge of tears. \nHe glances way down the road and spots a TINY CLOUD OF SMOKE miles away in the distance.  A car is moving in his direction. \nMaurice looks up into the DAZZLING WHITE SKY.  Drops of sweat falling into his eyes. \nMAURICE (whisper) It's over Ellen... I failed you again. \nMaurice looks down the road at the cloud of dust growing larger. \nMAURICE I tried Ellen, I really tried... I don't have the strength. \nThe cloud is now clearly a car... Maurice stares up into the sky again... The tears racing the sweat down his cheeks. Maurice YELLS TO THE HEAVENS. \nMAURICE You said I would never be alone!... You promised... (his yelling turns to sobs) ... You promised. \nMaurice's is interrupted by A SLIGHT RUSTLING BEHIND HIS HEAD.  Maurice turns and looks through his tears... \nThere, a few feet from him, perched quietly and majestically on the guardrail is a GOLDEN EAGLE.  It stands two and half feet tall.  It spreads it's great wings.  The feathers expand like a blanket, spanning six feet, and throwing a gentle shade on Maurice's face. \nMaurice is frozen in wonder.  The MAGIC of the moment glows in his eyes.  Maurice's face gains life... The dark feathered eagle stands like a god before Maurice.  The moment is breathtaking. \nCUT TO: \nROAD \nThe car on the road, takes the last quarter mile in seconds...

I never really showed her. \nBeat. \nKRIS I'm really lost.  What does this have to do with walking? \nMAURICE I said, 'I would do anything for her'... and she didn't believe me.

The steam from the water fills the room. \nMaurice raises his legs with great effort and submerges each leg into the steaming water.  His eyes close with great relief as his body melts into the tub.

The black tar from the road melting slightly. \nNo sign of Maurice.  WE SEE into the distance, not a soul in sight.  WE LOOK to a hillside a hundred meters from the road. There we see a figure lying still in the shade of an overhanging rock formation. \nMaurice has a towel over his eyes and his feet propped up on his shoulder bag.  He is fast asleep. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nDUSK \nThe SUN TURNS RED for one brilliant moment before hiding behind the horizon.  Like an alarm went off, Maurice wakes up and packs his things. \nCUT TO: \nROAD \nThe MOONLIGHT outlines a line figure hobbling his way step by step with a walking stick. \nThe air fills with a POWERFUL RUMBLE.  Maurice turns to see a wave of rocks and sand slide down a hillside to the road. They CAUSE A GREAT THUNDER that settles to dust.  Maurice walks down the center of the highway away from the hillside. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.  HIGHWAY - DAWN \nTHE FIERY NEVADA SUN BEGINS ITS ASCENT INTO THE SKY.  Maurice looks bad.  He's breathing heavy as he moves up a steep incline by the side of the road.  His feet slide on the loose dirt.  Maurice looks like he could collapse at any moment. \nHe makes it to the indentation in the hillside -- just enough room to lay down in the shade.  Maurice lays out slowly.  He pries off his sneakers, band-aids and blisters cover every inch of his feet.  Maurice dumps the sand out of his sneakers and painfully pulls them back on.  His eyes close as he tries to unbutton his jacket... too late he's asleep. \nMaurice's bed is a rock that juts from the side of the hill... First WE SEE nothing, then some grains of sand escape from the crack where the rock meets the hillside.  The CRACK BECOMES SLIGHTLY LARGER -- PULLING AWAY FROM THE HILL BY A FRACTION OF AN INCH.  It stabilizes there. \nMaurice unaware of his precarious situation sleeps twenty five feet above the ground. \nCUT TO: \nMID-DAY \nAnother sizzler.  Temperatures in the nineties.  The sun is directly overhead. \nMaurice stirs in his sleep, moving closer to the edge of the rock. \nA STEADY STREAM OF SAND POURS FROM THE CRACK... A SLIGHT TREMOR... THEN THE FRIGHTENING SOUND OF ROCK MOVING AGAINST ROCK... \nMaurice wakes up as he begins to slide off... Hands scraping at the dirt... He SLIDES OFF THE ROCK... Feet and hands desperately trying to cling to the hillside... He picks up speed as he tumbles down... Maurice looks down in time to see a small jut in the rock hurtling towards him... no time for panic... SLAM!  A SICKENING CRACK OF BONE as Maurice HITS the rock square in the ribs... Maurice flops down the rest of the slope like a rag doll... he comes to rest in the dirt, clutching his ribs.  The sun beats down on his stunned eyes. \nMaurice stares up at the dizzying slope.  Sand still trickling down to a stop.  He doesn't try to move for the first few seconds.  His breathing increasingly erratic. \nMaurice drags himself to sit upright.  The sharp pains causing a distorted grimace on his face.  A short rest, before working his way to his feet. \nCUT TO: \nHIGHWAY \nMaurice uses a highway guardrail as a backrest.  He takes a seat in the dirt.  Maurice's hair is damp with sweat.  His breathing relegated to slow gasps.  His left hand covering his rib cage protectively.  Blood begins to trickle through the spaces between his fingers. \nMaurice closes his eyes for a moment, before his bent leg goes into spasms... Maurice is forced to straighten the leg instantly... jarring his tender rib cafe... Maurice clings to the back of his thigh... Maurice is defeated... On the verge of tears. \nHe glances way down the road and spots a TINY CLOUD OF SMOKE miles away in the distance.  A car is moving in his direction. \nMaurice looks up into the DAZZLING WHITE SKY.  Drops of sweat falling into his eyes. \nMAURICE (whisper) It's over Ellen... I failed you again. \nMaurice looks down the road at the cloud of dust growing larger. \nMAURICE I tried Ellen, I really tried... I don't have the strength. \nThe cloud is now clearly a car... Maurice stares up into the sky again... The tears racing the sweat down his cheeks. Maurice YELLS TO THE HEAVENS. \nMAURICE You said I would never be alone!... You promised... (his yelling turns to sobs) ... You promised. \nMaurice's is interrupted by A SLIGHT RUSTLING BEHIND HIS HEAD.  Maurice turns and looks through his tears... \nThere, a few feet from him, perched quietly and majestically on the guardrail is a GOLDEN EAGLE.  It stands two and half feet tall.  It spreads it's great wings.  The feathers expand like a blanket, spanning six feet, and throwing a gentle shade on Maurice's face. \nMaurice is frozen in wonder.  The MAGIC of the moment glows in his eyes.  Maurice's face gains life... The dark feathered eagle stands like a god before Maurice.  The moment is breathtaking. \nCUT TO: \nROAD \nThe car on the road, takes the last quarter mile in seconds... SCREECHING IT'S BRAKES at the sight of Maurice on the side of the road. \nMaurice turns away from the bird as the car pulls up.  The driver gets out and calls over the hood. \nDRIVER Hey, man are you okay? \n", "test2_id": 2272, "test3_input": "MAURICE My wife is dead. \nMaurice continues his powerful gaze until Clive looks away.

Maurice has a glint of happiness in his eye.  They move through the doors marked \"Visitor's Area.\" \nMaurice stretches a huge grin as KRIS REDDY gets up from a chair.  Kris bends down and hugs Maurice emotionally. \nKRIS Tom Joad? \nMAURICE ...

There's a sign over the wood -- \"Office space available.\" \nThe loss is evident on Maurice's eyes. \nMAURICE I haven't been too punctual with the rent. \nKRIS I was thinking you could open another store with investors.  I'm sure a lot of people would want to get involved with you now. \nMaurice forces a smile. \nMAURICE Actually, I'm not worried about my career right now... I'm more worried about how you're getting me out of here? \nBeat.  Kris glances at the hair on his forearm. \nMAURICE Are they standing? \nKRIS (running his hand over his arm) Saluting. \nBeat. \nKRIS Come on Mr. Parker. \nMAURICE What, come on? \nKRIS I can't do it.

I thought you understood what I was doing. \nKRIS I do. \nMAURICE Why in God's name did you fly all the way here then? \nKRIS Don't do this. \nMAURICE ... To look me in the eye and say what's important to you isn't as important to me?  To tell me you know what's best?  To tell me life is more precious than what I feel for my wife? \nKris gets very emotional.  He rises from this chair. \nKRIS Mr. Parker, you can yell at me, if it'll help.  But I'm not risking your life. \nMAURICE It's mine to risk. \nMaurice turns to the window away from Kris. \n", "test3_true": "Kris walks to the door and stops. \nKRIS She knows you love her Mr. Parker.

His eyes scan the area quickly. He immediately finds the guard on the floor staring at him. The guard nods ever so slightly as if to say, \"I know what you're thinking.\"  Maurice turns his attention to a small boy in a hospital gown, being scolded by a head nurse. \nHEAD NURSE You cooperate with us about taking your medicine and maybe we'll talk about candy. \nThe head nurse takes a chocolate bar out of the boy's tiny hands.  The boy offers no response.  Maurice watches curiously as STEPHANIE walks over and pats the boys head. Maurice catches a small exchange -- Stephanie slips another candy bar into his pocket.  The boy breaks into a warm smile. Stephanie puts her fingers against her lips and winks. Maurice takes this exchange in with great interest. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

The female doctor looks at Maurice curiously, studying his demeanor -- she can't place him. \nThe ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN on the third floor... The SOUND OF A TV FLOODS THE ELEVATOR COMPARTMENT.  Maurice looks up in horror to see a close-up of his FACE superimposed on the TV screen seated on the receptionist's desk.  A man gets on the elevator. \nThe female doctor stares at the TV as the doors close -- she immediately turns to Maurice... her view is blocked by the new passenger... the elevator progresses down 2... 1...

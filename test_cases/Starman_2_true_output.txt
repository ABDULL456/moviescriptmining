A formation of six black Bell Cobra helicopters rush at us out of the blue. From above them we can see that they are heading for a small desert town. 'Welcome to Lathrop Wells' is spelled out on a hillside in white-washed stones. 
EXT. AIRSTRIP - DAY 
Grubby, unshaven and unwashed, Shermin, Bell, Lyman and the rest of the crew watch the seven Cobras land in sequence. Fox, immaculate in a freshly pressed black flight suit, climbs out of the first one down and he and Shermin meet in the middle of the runway. 
SHERMIN Hello George. 
FOX Shermin... 
SHERMIN What's all this for? 
FOX We have a new directive. I'm taking over. 
SHERMIN (scans the Cobras) We don't have to do it that way. We can catch him this time. 
FOX Washington thinks it's too late for that. 
SHERMIN I've never been taken off an assignment in my life. Give me twenty- four hours and I'll have him for you. 
FOX You're not hearing me. 
SHERMIN You can change a directive, George. You've done it before. Listen to me. He's going somewhere in Death Valley. Lathrop Wells was never anything but a bus stop. East is the nuclear site. There are no roads in there. She was teaching him to hitchhike. I'm telling you. We block the four roads into Death Valley and we got him. 
FOX We'll do that. But how are we going to hold him? He can change himself into a man. He can disappear. 
SHERMIN That's the chance we have to take. 
FOX No, we don't. 
SHERMIN Then you're going to have to do it without me. 
FOX You're a career intelligence officer, Shermin. You'll be in the air with us. 
SHERMIN You're talking about taking a life. The most unique life form on this planet. I think we're better than that. 
EXT. LAS VEGAS - LATE AFTERNOON 
A fire-engine-red Pontiac convertible with two COWBOYS (late fifties) in the front and Jenny and the STAR MAN in the back moves with the traffic along the main drag in the downtown area. The STAR MAN's head swivels from side to side trying to take in the neon that juts up around him. The convertible stops at a light. The cowboy on the passenger side opens the door and tips his hat to Jenny as she and the Star Man get out of the back seat. 
EXT. SIDEWALK (LAS VEGAS) - LATE AFTERNOON 
The STAR MAN is afraid of the crush of people and wants to stay close to Jenny, but is fascinated by the whir and click and jingle of the one-armed bandits that seem to be everywhere. 
STAR MAN Is this gambling? 
Jenny nods. A LADY in curlers and pedal pushers hits a twenty dollar jackpot. Hanging onto Jenny's hand the STAR MAN turns around and walks sideways to watch the quarters tumble out into the lady's shopping bag. 
STAR MAN The cowboys were right. You can make money fast gambling. 
JENNY You don't make money gambling. You lose it. 
INT. DRUG STORE - LATE AFTERNOON 
The STAR MAN hangs back to examine a one-armed bandit inside the front door while Jenny goes to the counter. An almost imperceptible blue haze seems to seep from under the STAR MAN's palms as he runs his hands up and down the sides of the machine. 
JENNY (V.O.) (to the clerk) Do you have a good map of Death Valley? 
CLERK (V.O.) We should have. Let me see. 
While the clerk searches for the map the STAR MAN comes up to Jenny. 
STAR MAN May I have twenty-five cents, please? 
JENNY What for? 
STAR MAN I want to gamble. 
Jenny sighs and rolls her eyes and fishes two quarters out of her purse and hands them to him. 
JENNY Here are two quarters. When you lose these, you're not going to get anymore. 
STAR MAN I understand. (heading back to the machine) Thank you. 
He drops a quarter into the slot and pulls the handle. While the pictures of fruit spin behind the view window, his hands stroke the sides of the machine. An orange, a pear and a cherry stop in the view window. At the counter Jenny explains to the clerk that she is hitchhiking and wants the busiest route into Death Valley without going through Lathrop Wells. The STAR MAN looks long and hard at the machine before putting in his last quarter. He pulls the handle. The blue haze flows from his palms, three cherries lock into a line and the one- armed bandit begins to spit quarters. 
INT. CASINO - LATE AFTERNOON 
Jenny is nervous about being here. She feels every face that looks at them could be a cop. The STAR MAN is pulling her through a Maginot Line of slot machines toward a 'Super Jackpot' machine that advertises a $275,000 payoff. 
JENNY This is crazy. We don't have time for this. 
STAR MAN I know how to gamble now. 
JENNY You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship. 
STAR MAN I want to get money for you and the baby. 
JENNY I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.

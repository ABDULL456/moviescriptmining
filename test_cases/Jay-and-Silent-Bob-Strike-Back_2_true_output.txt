Jay and Bob race around the building toward what looks like an open alley then smash into it, falling down. The open alley is a background painting that's being moved by some SCENICS. Jay and Bob get up, shaking off the impact. 
JAY I hate how fake Hollywood is. 
The SECURITY GUARD catches up to them now, grabbing them by their shoulders, spinning them around. 
SECURITY GUARD Where do you think you're going? 
JAY GET OFFA ME! RAAAAAPE!!! 
SECURITY GUARD This is L.A., sir. We don't rape our suspects in custody. We just beat them. (into walkie-talkie) Echo Base, I've got a ten-o-seven here: two unauthorizeds on the lot. Request back-up. 
VOICE (from walkie-talkie) I thought that was a ten-eighty-two. 
SECURITY GUARD No, sir--a ten-eight-two is the code for vanishing a dead hooker from Ben Affleck's trailer. 
VOICE (from walkie-talkie) Oh, that Affleck. Backup on the way. 
JAY Hey! I make you a deal: this guy'll suck your dick off if you let us go! 
SECURITY GUARD Contrary to what you believe, not everyone in the movie business is gay. 
JAY Well, how about this deal: he sucks my dick while you watch and jerk off. 
The Security Guard stops, looks around, then releases them, reaching into his pants. 
SECURITY GUARD Alright. But make is fast. And sexy. 
Silent Bob looks at Jay, wide-eyed and scared. 
JAY Dude, it's either this or jail. And you know what they make you do in jail. 
Silent Bob wells up with tears, slowly dropping to his knees, reaching for Jay's pants. The Security guard bends down low to watch at crotch-level. Suddenly, Jay hammers his two fists into the Security Guard's neck, knocking him out.  Silent Bob falls into a sitting position on the ground, relieved. Jay looks at him. 
JAY Well what are you waiting for, bitch? Start sucking. Bunnggg! (looking around) Alright--where they shooting this movie at? 
Silent Bob points behind Jay, at the SOUNDSTAGE they're in front of. There's a LINE OF PEOPLE waiting at the door. 
JAY Worth a shot. Like a shot in the mouth, you gay bitch. Eww, dude--you were really gonna suck my dick. 
Silent Bob shakes his head "no," wide-eyed as Jay heads off. When Jay's out of frame, Silent bob shrugs like, "Yeah--I guess I was." 
EXT. SOUNDSTAGE--DAY 
Jay and Bob approach the line, as an A.D. calls out to the crowd. 
A.D. Alright--bar extras. Follow me. 
The A.D. starts leading the crowd in. Jay and Bob blend in and follow inside. 
EXT. HIGHWAY--DAY 
An official-looking car tears down the road.

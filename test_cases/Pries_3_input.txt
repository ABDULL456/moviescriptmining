ORELAS Ecces Agnes Dei, ecces qui tollit peccata mundi. 
THERE'S A LOUD CRASH Everyone turns to see the massive chamber doors BURSTING inwards! THE BODIES OF TWO GUARDS skidding across the marble floor. 
PRIEST ENTERS THE CHAMBER A true force of nature now, coming like the Fourth Horseman. Grief and betrayal stoking his anger higher, a blaze igniting behind his eyes. 
BLACK HAT 
Steps from the shadows. Deep wounds line his face, the cross tattoo now gouged and distorted with blood -- He smiles. 
BLACK HAT I'm afraid you're too late, Priest. 
THE MONSIGNORS Shed their robes, revealing fresh BITE MARKS on their necks. Orelas' new-found fangs glint in the candlelight. 
ORELAS And why shouldn't we live forever? 
(HISSES) We're God's very voice. His vessel! 
PRIEST Stands shell shocked, the level of betrayal staggering. 
BLACK HAT ATTACKS SLAMMING.into him, the two warriors going at it in a brutal battle, the vampire raking his claws across Priest's face, drawing blood. 
PRIEST Sends him sailing through the air, Black Hat crashing into a collection of CANDLE HOLDERS, an ancient TAPESTRY catching fire, flames quickly spreading to the other fabrics -- The chamber erupting in an orange blaze! 
THE MONSIGNORS SHRIEK Bodies contorting in grotesque shapes as they BECOME. Black Hat stands triumphant, flames rising behind him. 
BLACK HAT With them I can start anew! You can't stop it -- 
(SMILES) Must be God's will. He flies across the room, BARRELING into Priest with everything he's got, DIGGING a hand into Priest's wound. 
BLACK HAT (CONT'D) "I looked and beheld a pale horse and His name that sat on him was Death" -- 
Priest coughs up blood. Black Hat smiles, wrapping a hand around Priest's. throat, LIFTING him off the floor, SQUEEZING the life from him, 
BLACK HAT (CONT'D) "And all hell followed with him." He raises his head back, ready to sink his teeth. Priest too exhausted to fight back. This is it. Prom a b= -- 
THE GIANT GOLD CROSS Breaks from the wall with a GROAN, PLUMMETING towards them. Black Hat stops, his eyes snapping upward. At the last second -- 
PRIEST WRENCHES himself from,Black Hat's grip, tumbling. across the floor. WHAPI The cross S LM onto Black Hat, pulverizing hi ! 
Chunks of glass and stone rain down around Priest, the chamber starting to COLLAPSE. Diving, he barely makes it out, the rotunda .CRASHING down behind him., The Monsignors lunge but Priest manages to jam the doors shut, locking them in. They BASH against the door, SHRIEKING horribly, the chamber now an oven. Priest presses against the door, it SPLINTERS all around him, the terrible sound RISING until finally it stops. 
PRIEST 
(WHISPERS) Forgive me. He collapses, making the sign of the cross. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CLERGY CATHEDRAL - MOMENTS LATER 
Complete chaos. 
PEOPLE stream out of the massive doorway, stampeding down the stairs, the giant structure enveloped in smoke and flame. Priest looks up to find FATHER KOEPPEN. The old man staring .at him. A lost soul. 
KOEPPEN Am I next? Priest approaches -- Koeppen closing his eyes, ready for the blow he knows is to come. But Priest only lifts the man's head, studying his neck. He's clean. And without a single word -- Priest just walks away. When Koeppen opens his eyes, he's a new man -- a man absolved. With renewed energy, he looks to the crowd around him. And for the first moment in a long time ...He believes. 
KOEPPEN (CONT'D) 
(CALLING OUT) People don't run! God is here for youl He wants you to STOPI Stop and ask yourself a question And the people DO stop, looking to him, the panic leaving their eyes...

EXT. MERCEDES' HOUSE -- MERCEDES 
Mercedes is lost in thought as she recalls. She steps into the light by the carport. Enrique and Nestor are propping Anselma's leg up on pillows in the back of Mercedes' old station wagon-- 
MERCEDES Rapidamente! Everybody in the world is going to see! 
ENRIQUE Donde vamos? [Where are we going?] 
MERCEDES A casa de Porfirio Zayas. He used to be a doctor on the other side. Gunshot wounds, fixing babies--if you can pay he can handle it. 
ENRIQUE Senora, anything it costs, I can work-- 
MERCEDES Don't worry about it. He owes me some favors. 
Enrique turns to ANSELMA still frightened in the rear of the station wagon-- 
ENRIQUE Seas tranquila, mija. (Nods to Mercedes) Estamos en las manos de Senora Cruz. [Just relax, honey. We're in the hands of Senora Cruz.] 
Mercedes starts the car-- 
MERCEDES In English, Enrique. In English-- 
INT. DEL'S HOUSE -- DINING  ROOM 
Del steps in. Chet sits at the table, drawing a cartoon in panels. Del looks over his shoulder for a moment-- 
CARTOON 
A tank rolling over barbed wire, cannon and machine gun blasting away-- 
DEL (O.S.) Homework? 
DEL AND CHET 
CHET I finished that. I'm just messing around. 
DEL Tanks, huh? 
CHET You got to be in the Army, you might as well have something slick to drive. 
DEL So you're going into the Army? 
Chet looks at him, not in a good mood, then goes back to his drawing-- 
CHET That's the general plan, isn't it? 
Del watches for a long moment, thinking-- 
DEL (Softly) That's up to you. 
Chet looks at his father again. All this is news to him-- 
DEL The Army isn't for everybody. 
Chet can't quite believe he is hearing this. Del crosses to the refrigerator-- 
DEL Not that I don't think you'd be good at it, but--you know--I wouldn't be disappointed if you decided to do something else with your life. 
CHET You wouldn't? 
DEL No. 
Chet nods, begins to play again, considering the possibilities. Del is making an effort and he doesn't have much practice-- 
DEL How's your room shaping up? 
CHET Fine. I'm pretty much moved in. 
DEL Good. 
An awkward silence-- 
CHET (Tentative) Are we going to ever see your father? 
DEL My father. 
CHET Yeah. He lives here, right? 
DEL He does. 
Del pulls some food out, watching Chet as he draws-- 
DEL Maybe we'll clean that thing out back up, have a barbecue next weekend. We could invite him and his wife over. 
CHET Cool. 
Chet flips the page of his sketchbook-- 
CHET He makes his own sauce. 
EXT. PARKING LOT, BIG O'S -- NIGHT 
The neon's off, but there are a couple cars in the lot and a light within. Sam pulls into the lot, steps out, approaches the door--

Rain beats at the roof and the jack sinks the wagon behind them. 
She's blind, Ross - that's why all the scars - hear that traffic light? That noise is to help blind people - that's why the marks on her finger- tips? - this lady reads in Braille .. 
27:  INT.  ADMINISTRATION.  POLICE STATION.  DAY. 
BERLIN sits at a desk at the end of the room. Nothing here but a legal pad and a phone. The pad is covered in names & numbers. Right now he's into a call and this is sounding promising."How old?" And he writes 26. "How long?" About 6 weeks ago. Hope in his eyes as he looks across to a woman called ANN. She's doing what he's doing on a different line "Wait a minute, I specific- ally said I was looking for a girl?" And all hope over because Lesley is a boy. But here comes ANN & this might be something? 
ANN Shasta-Trinity Institute. Line one. 
Sticks a sheet of notes on his desk and he junks the last call. 
BERLIN (New call) Hello .. Yes .. This is Sergeant Berlin .. Yes, that's right .. I believe my assistant explained? .. How long ago was that? .. Uh-huh. O.K. .. Who is who? .. Whass his name? Goodridge? O.K. I'll hold .. 
ROSS in transit grinning from ear to ear. BERLIN interested in little but his notes and ROSS in nothing but obvious good news. 
ROSS Pig Woman agreed to take a test. 
BERLIN I think I got something - twenty two years old, dark hair - study- ing mathematics - (Yes, yes, I'm holding) - Last seen 5 weeks ago .. 
28:  EXT.  LANDSCAPE/ROAD.  TRINITY FOREST.  DAY. 
Mussorgsky is back on a shock cut. Big music and a shattering landscape. Juniper woods and mountains. Sunlight on fresh fal- len snow. Somewhere a long way off a car crawls up the valley. 
Ross's car bursts into frame and as quickly the bend snatches it away. An unexpected building in the distance. Victorian at a glance but probably later. A clock tower and fifty lifeless windows. The Chevy disappears towards its somber architecture. 
29:  EXT.  THE SHASTA-TRINITY INSTITUTE.  DAY. 
Pine trees and slush and parked cars. The Chevrolet swings in and parks in front of the mansion. Breath in the air and eyes on the ugly pile as they slam doors and head for its entrance. 
30:  INT.  ENTRANCE/RECEPTION.  INSTITUTE.  DAY. 
BERLIN first with ROSS following. As soon as they hit the ent- rance they trigger a recorded voice. "YOU ARE NOW AT THE MAIN ENTRANCE. THERE ARE SIX STEPS." Midway up them with ROSS look- ing back. "RECEPTION IS THROUGH SWING DOORS AND TO YOUR RIGHT." 
31:  INT.  PRINCIPAL'S OFFICER.  INSTITUTE.  DAY. 
GOODRIDGE is mid-50's with a beard like Abraham Lincoln. Sits far side of his desk alternating eyes between ROSS and BERLIN. The latter studies a photograph of a Girl in a file. It's pos- sible they've found Jennifer Two? "How recent is the picture?" 
GOODRIDGE As recent as we have .. What ex- actly is your interest in Amber? 
BERLIN I'm afraid I can't give you an ans- wer to that, Mr Goodridge. As I ex- plained to your secretary, we're do- ing a lotta looking, but we're not even sure it's her we're lookin for .. 
GOODRIDGE Then what are you hoping I'm gon- na do? Dissuade, or persuade you? 
BERLIN I was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is? 
GOODRIDGE Then you could have saved yourself a lot of driving, Sergeant. What I said on the phone's the same as I'm saying now. I got no idea where Amb- er is, or who it was took her there. 
He doesn't like them but not as much as ROSS doesn't like him. 
ROSS A blind girl can just walk out of here, and you don't know who with? 
GOODRIDGE You find something curious in that? 
ROSS Yeah, I guess I do. 
GOODRIDGE Then let me put your mind at ease .. Firstly, Amber isn't "blind" - she has some useful vision - and second, this isn't a prison, it's a college of higher education - a severe vis- ual disability doesn't mean my stud- ents don't value their independence as much as anybody else - and Amber was a very independent young woman - She decided to leave - so she left .. 
ROSS And you got no idea with who? 
GOODRIDGE No, Sergeant, I got no idea with who. And I might add, that in another six weeks, a hundred and fifty students will be leaving here, & driving away for their Christmas holidays with pe- ople whose name I-won't-know-either .. 
ROSS could sock him in the crop but the phone rings and he ex- cuses himself to answer it. Whatever he hears he isn't liking. 
You have an appointment with Miss Robertson? 
BERLIN Yes, Sir. 
GOODRIDGE As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about? 
BERLIN Well, apparently, she saw Amber the weekend she left, & was briefly in the room with the guy she left with. 
GOODRIDGE I see .. Well, she's teaching an- other class at four .. I'd apprec- iate it if you don't detain her .. 
32:  INT.  CORRIDOR.  INSTITUTE.  DAY. 
Looking back down a deserted corridor. Someone tried to put sun- shine on the walls with yellow paint. Somewhere a long way away there is a sound like children singing. ROSS loathes this joint. Loathes its silence. Eyes back to BERLIN as he rings a doorbell. 
ROSS Where is everyone? 
BERLIN I dunno .. I guess this is staff side of the building? 
Here come footsteps and the door is opened by HELENA ROBERTSON. Early 20's and blonde and not immediately beautiful. But delic- ate features than need no make up and big dark eyes. They look away for introductions as though she's shy. ROSS & BERLIN grab glances as they follow in. Neither expected HELENA to be blind. 
33:  INT.  APARTMENT.  INSTITUTE.  DAY. 
Claustrophobia evaporates instantly. Great views down the val- ley from every window. Plus a bizarre jumble of furniture and colors. But no pictures on the walls. No friendly photographs. Nor any lights. Although the afternoon is shutting down there isn't a light in the room. ROSS elects to stay at the windows. BERLIN takes an offered chair. HELENA sits nervously opposite. 
HELENA What d'you wanna ask, Mr Ross? 
BERLIN I'm Mr Berlin.  Mr Ross is right here. And Mr Ross is maybe gonna take a few notes, if that's O.K.? (She nods) O.K. .. I'd like you to tell me in what ever way you want, what you can remember about the time you spent with Amber on the aft- ernoon she left? Take your time, and nothing's too trivial, O.K.

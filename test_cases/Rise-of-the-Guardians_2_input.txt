NORTH Out of the way! 
The sleigh heads down a luge-like track. North and Jack are enjoying the ride. 
NORTH Hyah! 
BUNNYMUND Ohhhhhh no! 
North cracks the reigns, the sleigh plummets, an almost vertical drop. Sandy grins calmly. Jack loves this. Bunnymund - not so much. 
BUNNYMUND (WALLA) Slow down, slow down! 
North pulls a lever, kicking the sleigh into overdrive. He looks back as the sleigh enters a corkscrew. 
NORTH I hope you like the loopty loops! 
BUNNYMUND (NAUSEOUS) I hope you like carrots. 
NORTH Here we go! 
WIDE SHOT as the sleigh reaches the bottom of the ramp, and shoots upwards, launching them into bright blue sky. 
JACK WOOO-HOOOOOO!!!!!! 
EXT. SLEIGH - FLYING THROUGH THE SKY - CONTINUOUS 
North, reins in hand, leans into the wind as the reindeer climb higher. 
NORTH Klasno! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 44. 
Jack, in his element, leaps up onto the rear of the sleigh to watch the North Pole fade into the distance. 
JACK (LAUGHS) Whoa! 
Bunnymund peaks off the side of the sleigh, then leans back, and holds on for dear life. 
JACK Hey, Bunny-- 
Bunny turns to see Jack standing on the back edge of the sleigh. 
JACK Check out this view-- EEEYAAAAGGHGHH! 
Jack is SWEPT OFF the sleigh and disappears! Bunny gasps in horror and looks over the side...only to see Jack lounging on the sleigh's skid. 
JACK Awww...you do care. 
BUNNYMUND Ah, rack off you bloody show pony! 
Bunny glowers as Jack makes his way back into the sleigh. 
NORTH Hold on everyone, I know a shortcut. 
BUNNYMUND Oh strewth, I knew we should have taken the tunnels. 
North holds a snow globe up to his face. 
NORTH I say, Tooth Palace. 
An image of the Tooth Palace appears inside the snowglobe. North throws the globe into the air and a giant vortex opens. 
NORTH Hyah! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 45. 
EXT. SKY - SLEIGH JETTING THROUGH THE SKY 
A surreal light surrounds the sleigh as it hits HYPERDRIVE and gets sucked through the snow-globe portal with a WHOOSH. 
CUT TO: 
SEQ. 1300 - TOOTH PALACE DESTROYED 
EXT. SKY - NEAR TOOTH'S PALACE 
The sleigh suddenly comes out of HYPERDRIVE at the outskirts of the Tooth Palace. Streaks of black rapidly approaching. 
NORTH What!? 
Suddenly our heroes find themselves in the midst of mayhem, as hundreds of Nightmares and terrified Tooth Fairies jet past. It's like a meteor storm. North yanks the reins, and the sleigh veers sharply, dodging the oncoming Nightmares. 
NORTH What are they!? 
Sandy and Bunny duck the onslaught. 
BUNNYMUND Whoa! 
Jack now sees that the Nightmares are actually GULPING DOWN the fleeing fairies and flying off with them. It's chaos. 
JACK They're taking the tooth fairies! 
Jack looks up to see a lone fairy with a Nightmare snapping at its heels. Jack leaps into the air and rescues it before the Nightmare can snatch it away. 
Jack lands back in the sleigh. He opens his hand to reveal Baby Tooth, who's shaking with fear. 
JACK Hey little Baby Tooth, you okay? 
As Baby Tooth nods, North steers the sleigh forward through the storm toward the entrance of Tooth's Palace. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 46. 
INT. TOOTH PALACE - A MOMENT LATER 
A vast chamber supported by pillars containing millions of tiny wooden deposit boxes from floor to ceiling. North spots a Nightmare up ahead and hands Jack the reigns.

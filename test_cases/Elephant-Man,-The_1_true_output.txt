TREVES I tell you what, I'll ask you a question, and you shake your head like this for "no" and nod like this for "yes", alright? Do you understand? 
The figure following Treves' movements nods very slowly, "yes". Treves sighs with relief. 
TREVES Are you in any pain? 
The figure begins to babble incoherently. Treves, alarmed, interrupts. 
TREVES Um, no. Just nod your head like this for "yes" and shake it like this for "no". Now, are you in any pain? 
Again the figure, following Treves movements, shakes his head "no". 
TREVES Are your parents still alive? 
The figure does nothing. Treves is quite nervous. 
TREVES Do you understand? Are they dead? Your father... your mother? 
The figure begins to moan. There are two sharp raps at the door. The hooded figure flinches. 
The door opens and Fox pokes his head into the room. 
FOX Freddie, what you doing for... I say do open a window in here or... 
He notices the hooded figure. 
FOX Oh, I'm dreadfully sorry, I had no idea that... I say! 
Treves quickly rises and pushes Fox out into the hallway, following him and closing the door. 
IN THE HALLWAY 
Treves and Fox are standing outside the door to Treves' office. 
FOX Good Lord, Freddie! What have you got in there? 
TREVES You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself. 
FOX Certainly, if you insist. You must have quite a find there. 
TREVES I don't know what I've got. 
FOX Nothing of any importance, eh? 
Treves turns to go back in, then stops. 
TREVES I'll tell you this much, Fox, it's beyond anything you or I have ever dealt with. Keep it to yourself, please. 
He goes back in, shutting the door. 
TREVES' OFFICE 
Treves turns the key in the door. He turns to the chair the figure had been occupying, but he is not there. 
The figure is hiding in the corner, crouched behind a black frock operating coat, so stiff with dried blood and pus it stands up by itself. 
Treves looks quickly around the room and finally sees him. He looks at the figure for a moment. 
TREVES Come sit down. 
The frightened figure just crouches there looking at him. Treves goes to him, pulls him up and over to the chair. 
TREVES Sit... down. 
The figure sits. Treves pauses uncertainly. 
TREVES I think I'll examine you now. I'll save the questions for later... Will you take off your hat now, please? 
The figure does nothing. Treves moves to him. 
TREVES Don't be frightened, I simply want to look at you. Do you understand? 
The figure leans back fearfully. From behind him we see just the top of his wide hooded head. 
Treves, standing before him, lifts the hood up and back. 
TREVES (more to himself) That's right, don't be frightened. Don't be frightened. 
SMALL ROOM - LONDON HOSPITAL 
We see two cameras set up, their OPERATORS next to them staring at something we cannot see. Treves stands beside them concentrating on the same sight. 
All three are speechless. 
Treves suddenly remembers himself. 
TREVES Are you ready? 
The Cameramen mumble, "Yes", and gratefully disappear beneath the black cloths of their cameras. 
TREVES Go ahead. 
They trigger the flash powder. In the blinding flashes we briefly see the silhouette of a tremendously bulky figure, starting at the light.

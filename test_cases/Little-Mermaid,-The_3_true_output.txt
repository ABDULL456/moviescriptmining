(Morning at castle. Ariel and Eric leave for their tour. Ariel is amazed by everything.) Flounder: (As they pass water.) Has he kissed her yet? Sebastion: Not yet. Flounder: Ohh . . . (Ariel and Eric go dancing and see the town.) Scuttle: Yo, Flounder! Any kissing? Flounder: No, not yet. Scuttle: Hmm. Well they - they better get crackin'. (They leave town and Ariel drives, almost crashing. They end up rowing on a still lagoon in the even- ing.) Flounder: Move over - move your big feathers.  I can't see a thing. Scuttle: Nothing is happening. . . .  Only one day left, and that boy ain't puckered up once.  O.K.  All right, this calls for a little vocal romantic stimulation. Stand back. (He flies over and sings very badly.) Eric: Wow. Somebody should find that poor animal and put it out of its misery. Sebastian: Jeez, man, I'm surrounded by amateurs!  You want something done, you've got to do it yourself.  First, we got to create the mood. Percussion. . . .  Strings. . . .  Winds. . . .  Words. . . . 
There you see her Sitting there across the way She don't got a lot to say But there's something about her And you don't know why But you're dying to try You wanna kiss the girl

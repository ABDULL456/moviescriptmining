LARRY He's been here.  There's stuff in the kitchen.  He must have made a hasty exit. 
The 'phone rings downstairs.  JULIA jumps. 
That'll be Kirsty. 
LARRY stands up and leaves the room, moving past JULIA in the doorway, who is left to stare down at the bed FRANK has slept in, and the suitcase of belongings. As we hear LARRY clatter downstairs it seems JULIA's face is close to tears. 
12   INT.   DOWNSTAIRS ROOM   DAY 
The 'phone continues to ring.  LARRY steps through and picks up the receiver. 
LARRY Hello ...? 
There's no answer. 
Hello ...? 
13   INT.   FRANK'S 'BEDROOM'   DAY 
JULIA goes to the open suitcase, and looks at the photographs. 
14   INT.   DOWNSTAIRS ROOM    DAY 
LARRY (on'phone) Is there anybody there? 
He puts down the 'phone.  He goes back out into the hall. 
15   INT.   FRANK'S 'BEDROOM'   DAY 
Nervous that LARRY will return and see what she's doing, JULIA is going through the photographs. 
LARRY (from below) There's nobody there - 
The sound of his foot on the stairs.  Hurriedly, she selects a photograph of Frank without the girl, and pockets it. 
16   INT.   STAIRS   DAY 
LARRY is climbing the stairs. 
LARRY I'm surprised it's even connected ... 
The 'phone rings again. 
Shit. 
17   INT.   FRANK'S BEDROOM    DAY 
Mission accomplished, JULIA leaves the bedroom, taking one last glance at the sweat-stained sheet and the indented pillar where Frank lay.  A lone wood-louse crawls over the sheet, navigating the folds.  She closes the door on the sight.  Downstairs, the 'phone stops ringing. 
18   INT.   DOWNSTAIRS ROOM   DAY 
LARRY has picked up the 'phone. 
LARRY Who's there? 
KIRSTY (barely audible) Daddy? 
CUT TO 
19   INT.   KIRSTY'S ROOM    DAY 
KIRSTY, the daughter of Larry's first marriage, and his only child, on the 'phone.  She is barely twenty, beautiful in an unpretensious way: a dream of a girl- next-door.  We can't see much of the room she's in at the moment, the shot is too tight. 
LARRY   (V.0.) Kirsty? 
KIRSTY I got through. 
LARRY   (V.O.) Where are you? 
KIRSTY I found a room. 
20   INT.   DOWNSTAIRS ROOM   DAY 
LARRY (on 'phone) What did you say? 
21   INT.   KIRSTY'S ROOM   DAY

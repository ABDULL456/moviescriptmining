MITCHELL Hello? 
No response.  MITCHELL picks up the guitar, which begins to produce a terrifying electronic feedback. 
CUT TO 
EXT. FAIRGROUND -- DAY 
SAM and NICOLE wander through the fairground.  Various rides and concession stands are being set up.  SAM has his arm around NICOLE. 
SAM That was great. 
NICOLE Really? 
SAM You're going to blow everyone away. 
NICOLE You mean it? 
SAM Of course. 
NICOLE You don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure. 
SAM I am.  Really.  It was awesome. 
NICOLE assesses SAM.  Sensing his sincerity, she throws her arms around him in a gesture of unabashed excitement. 
NICOLE I'm so happy, Daddy. 
CUT TO 
EXT. BIDE-A-WILE MOTEL -- DUSK 
MITCHELL STEPHEN'S car pulls into the parking lot of this run-down roadside motel.  In the fading light, a magnificent mountain range is seen in the background. 
CUT TO 
INT. BIDE-A-WILE MOTEL -- EVENING 
MITCHELL enters the reception area, and rings a bell on the desk.  After a few moments RISA WALKER appears.  She is an exhausted looking woman in her mid-thirties, once attractive but very run-down.  RISA stares at MITCHELL'S soaked clothes. 
MITCHELL Hello. 
RISA 
Is it raining outside? 
MITCHELL No, I...had an accident. 
Pause.  RISA stares at MITCHELL, her expression somewhere else. 
MITCHELL (CONT'D) Do you have a room? 
RISA Will you be spending more than a night? 
MITCHELL Hard to say.  I might have...some business here. 
A voice is heard from the darkness beyond the desk. 
WENDELL Are you a reporter? 
MITCHELL No. 
WENDELL WALKER, RISA'S husband, appears from the darkness. 
WENDELL You here about the accident? 
MITCHELL stares at WENDELL'S haunted eyes, then looks back at RISA.  He immediately knows their story. 
MITCHELL Yes.  I'm a lawyer.  I realize this is an awful time, but it's important that we talk.

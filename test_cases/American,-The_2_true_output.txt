CLARA This cannot be for sale. But I am not want to... come se dice? 
JACK Give it away. 
She looks at him. 
JACK studies her, searching for his own feelings. 
CLARA Stronzo! I buy you a present! 
She fishes about in her handbag... 
...and produces a SILVER BOX. 
JACK unwraps the shiny paper. Inside is a plastic case like the sort you put engagement rings in. Inside the case is a BADGE, hand-painted, depicting the symbol of the region: the eagle of L'Aquila. JACK sticks the BADGE in his lapel. 
JACK Grazie. 
An embarrassed beat. 
CLARA kisses him. 
JACK Grazie, Clara. 
CLARA Prego. Eduardo. 
A pause. 
CLARA My apartment is not far from here. 
123   INT. CLARA'S APARTMENT- MORNING                            123 
JACK opens his eyes. 
Sits up. 
He's shocked to have slept so deeply. 
CLARA must be in the shower. 
He looks around at the little room casually, like a curious lover. 
Opens the top drawer of the bedside cabinet. 
Finds a VIBRATOR. 
Opens the bottom drawer. 
Finds a RED PURSE. 
Inside the RED PURSE... 
Finds a BERETTA DOUBLE-ACTION MODEL 21A BOBCAT. 
Just at that moment CLARA comes out of the bathroom. 
JACK shuts the drawer and pretends to be asleep. 
124   EXT.PAY PHONE- DAY                                           124 
JACK has driven to the remotest phone box he can find: not far from the entrance to one of the region's four national parks: beside a lake, below a mountain range and approached by a long, straight, empty road. 
No one could possibly creep up on him here. Nevertheless, as he talks, JACK makes his habitual and continuous 360 scan of the area. 
LARRY (V.O.) We're moving the drop. 
JACK Where? 
LARRY (V.O.) We don't know yet. I'll call you ten am on the day with a venue. Give you enough time to make the noon delivery. 
JACK I don't deliver, Larry. I never deliver. It's too dangerous. She comes to me. I know the town. That's what we agreed. 
LARRY (V.O.) I told `em. I told `em if there was even the slightest chance security had been breached, you'd have dealt with it immediately. 
A beat. 
JACK Breach? What breach? 
For the first time in the movie we cut to LARRY at home: 
125   INT. LARRY'S APARTMENT, ROME- DAY                            125 
LARRY is sitting in a high back leather office chair before a large, imperial mahogany desk. In front of him are two banks of screens. 
The first bank displays 3 CCTV views: (1) the entrance to his apartment block (2) a staircase and (3) the entrance to his apartment itself. 
Another bank of screens shows 3 NEWS CHANNELS: (1) CNN, (2) BBC WORLD and (3) AL JAZEERA. 
LARRY Our pretty young Belgian client and her associates think someone on your long list of enemies might have put a tail on you. 
JACK (V.O.) Not possible. 
LARRY Course not, Jack. But if, for the sake of argument, it was possible- I'm thinking it could be Galazzo. Or Simenov. Or Italian undercover. 
JACK (V.O.) Cops? 
LARRY The crooked kind. 
JACK (V.O.) How come I'm still here? 
LARRY The Belgians think they're planning to wait for the drop and exterminate you and Mathilde in one swoop. 
With the help of his DESKTOP computer LARRY is comparing the scrolling share prices on CNN with the fluctuating value of the US DOLLAR. 
JACK (V.O.) Where the hell's this information coming from? 
LARRY I'm fucked if I know, Jack. If you want my opinion, they're just being jittery. I told `em you were the most security conscious professional I know. I told `em no one gets close to you. 
126   EXT.PAY PHONE- DAY                                         126 
JACK They don't.

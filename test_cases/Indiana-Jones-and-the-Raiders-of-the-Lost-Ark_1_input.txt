Belzig has his burned hand stuck deep in the snow. Now he withdraws it, steaming, and scurries off into the night like a wounded animal. 
INT. "THE RAVEN" - NIGHT 
Marion throws down the empty submachine gun and moves through the flames to the center of the bar where she left the box with the five grand. She finds the remains of the box and its contents: a shapeless pile of ash and charred wood. 
MARION Unbelievable! 
At the end of the bar, the Mongolian has come back to life. He shakes out his head, then reaches inside his coat and pulls out a Mauser pistol. 
Indy smashes a chair over the head of the Giant Sherpa and the huge creature goes down. 
The Mongolian points his Mauser through the smoke and flame at Indy. Suddenly, the Mongolian is shot dead. 
Marion stands beneath her stuffed raven with the Baretta. 
Indy moves quickly through the flames, his eyes scanning the floor. He picks up his bullwhip and his crumpled felt hat. He peers through the smoke till he spots Marion moving among the burning furniture. 
INDY Let's get out of here! 
MARION Not without that piece you want! 
INDY It's here? 
Marion nods, kicks aside a burning chair. Another burning beam falls from the roof. Indy pulls Marion close to him protectively. 
INDY Forget it! I want you out of here. Now! 
He begins dragging her out. 
MARION (pointing) There! 
She breaks away from him, darts back and picks the hot medallion up in the loose cloth of her blouse. 
INDY Let's go! 
MARION (looking around) You burned down my place! 
INDY (figuratively) I owe you plenty! 
MARION (literally) You owe me plenty! 
INDY (smiles) You're something! 
MARION I am something. And I'll tell you exactly what - 
She holds up the medallion possessively. 
MARION I'm your partner! 
EXT. CAIRO - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY 
First we see the sprawl, the soaring minarets, the ancient skyline. Then we're closer, in the narrow, exotic streets, teeming with life: fierce-looking men in tattered galabiyas, black-gowned women with veiled faces, ragged, barefoot children. 
INT. DINING ROOM - SALLAH'S HOUSE (OLD CAIRO) 
Indy and Marion have been welcomed like family into the crowded home of SALLAH, his wife FAYAH, and their NINE CHILDREN (ages 4 - 18). Fayah, a huge, imposing woman, appears, at first glance, to be the power in the house. Sallah, a small, cheerful, energetic fellow in his forties defers to his wife in all matters of little importance. Suddenly the general liveliness at the children's table escalates into pandemonium, attracting the attention of the adults. 
FAYAH Silence! (there is silence) Why do you forget yourselves?

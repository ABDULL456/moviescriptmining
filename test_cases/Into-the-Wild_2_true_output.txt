Chris stands beside a dramatic section of rapids.    The whitewater roars. 
As we SLOWLY ZOOM INTO Chris' face, terrified and absorbed by the torrent, a bead of sweat drops across his forehead, TILTS OUR CAMERA to his trembling hands and legs, when Peter Gabriel's I Have The Touch begins to play. 
BACK TO: 
ZOOM INTO Chris' face...a decision: Fear becomes determination We SMASH CUT ON CUE with Peter Gabriel's vocals. SLO MO, SUPER DRAMATIC - Chris blasting out of a shoot in the rapids in the kayak we saw the night before. It's outrageous. Hair-raising. Just like Peter Gabriel sings it, he has the touch. 
This kid's never kayaked before, certainly never on rapids. But it's that immortal stage of life, no care, no helmet, no life-jacket, pure adrenaline. He can hardly believe he's surviving it as he goes but there's no looking back now. And with every thump of the music, we share his rush. His pure unadulterated exhilaration. 
With the culmination of the music, Chris has successfully shot the rapid. He paddles through quiet waters. 
We move in on him as he maneuvers the kayak to face upstream. There before him, the impossible rapid he had just completed. 
CHRIS (to himself) I'm Superman. SuperTramp. 
He feels immortal. He makes his about-face and is about to head down stream when he sees at the river's edge, a group of RIVER TOURISTS and their GUIDE lunching beside a pontoon raft. The tourists look like a bunch of bewildered tubby-troopers in their misfitted orange life- vests and cereal bowl helmets. The RIVER GUIDE yells out at Chris as Chris moves PAST CAMERA and away. The guide gets on his satellite phone to alert the Rangers. We ZOOM SLOWLY away from them toward the rapid. 
CUT TO: 
84   EXT. ANOTHER QUIET SECTION OF RIVER - LATER                  84 
Phillip Glass' Cloudscape plays OVER:   Chris paddles on. 
LOW ANGLE: It is a narrow gorge of solid rock, looking up from hundreds of feet below the canyon crest. 
CUT TO: 
85   EXT. FURTHER ALONG THE RIVER - LATER                         85 
The canyon has widened to beach-like banks.   Music FADES. 
Along the banks he sees a YOUNG BLONDE COUPLE. This is MADS and SONJA, in their 20's, Danish. They play at the river's edge beside their campsite, hotdogs cooking on a Hibachi. Chris averts his eyes when Sonja rises from the water, topless. 
MADS (yelling out to Chris) Hello! 
CHRIS Hello. 
MADS You can join us! 
Chris doesn't know quite what to do. But Mads seems quite comfortable inviting a stranger into the presence of his topless girlfriend. 
MADS (CONT'D) We have hotdogs! 
Chris - can't turn that down!   He paddles to within feet of the water's edge. 
MADS (CONT'D) I am Mads. 
CHRIS Hi. Alex. 
SONJA I am Sonja. 
Chris gives Sonja a little wave. She bypasses it, wading up to the Kayak, giving him a big hug. 
SONJA (CONT'D) Hello Alex. 
This couple is extremely energetic. Can't wait to please. And a bona fide American adventurer in their midst. It's everything they could've wanted. 
MADS We are from Copenhagen.   And you are from the rapids. 
CHRIS I am. 
SONJA My Got! MADS Crazy man. You're a crazy man!    Sonja, he is a crazy man. (to Chris) I'll make you a hotdog. 
Mads grabs a hotdog from the Hibachi. 
MADS (CONT'D) Just one minute. One minute... 
Sonja has moved to the tent to put on a dry T-shirt. But as she moves back to the water's edge, those nipples keep saying Hello. 
Chris, meanwhile, simply cannot wipe the smile off his face in the presence of these warm, open people. 
MADS (CONT'D) I love this. Don't you love this? This is nature. We see it in the American movies. How come you're crazy? 
CHRIS Well... 
MADS (interrupting) Because that's crazy! You come down the rapids. What do you want on your hotdog? Mustard and relish? 
CHRIS You have ketchup? 
MADS No, I have mustard and relish. 
CHRIS Mustard and relish it is then. 
MADS Sonja, you want a hotdog? 
SONJA (in Danish) Of course I want a hotdog.   Why are you stupid? 
Mads plops two more hotdogs onto the grill. 
MADS (translating) She asked me why I'm stupid. And I say, well...like I ask you why you're crazy and you say "well." Where are you going? 
CHRIS I haven't decided. 
MADS We like it here very much. We went to Los Angeles. And then, we went to Las Vegas.

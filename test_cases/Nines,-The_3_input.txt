INT. SUSINA - DAY [LATER] 
Dahlia is gone.           INTERVIEW with Gavin. 
GAVIN I see why the network loves her. It's just, I wrote the part for Melissa. She's one of my best friends. And in my head, I only see Melissa for the role. (jump cut) Could Dahlia do it? Absolutely. It could work. I just don't know if I want it to work. 
OMIT 
INT. PC BANG - NIGHT 
A empty storefront in Koreatown, both walls lined with computers for the CUSTOMERS playing high-end videogames.                                 We see Gavin playing. 
His INTERVIEW is intercut with his intense focus on the screen as he plays "Bad Day L.A." 
GAVIN When I get stressed out, I play videogames. It's my therapy. I can't have them on my own computer, because then I'd never write. So I come down to Koreatown. (jump cut) (MORE) 
GAVIN (CONT'D) Videogames are better than real life. When you get stuck, you can always hit `reset.' Life needs a reset button. 
INT. KITCHEN - DAY 
Gavin's on the phone. 
GAVIN If we're really going to replace Melissa, I want to hear it from Roger. 
INT. SUSAN'S OFFICE - DAY 
Susan talks to the speakerphone. 
INTERCUT GAVIN 
SUSAN Roger's on a flight to London. But I talked with him before he left. He said yes on Dahlia. 
GAVIN What does that mean? 
SUSAN It means yes. 
GAVIN Yes, replace Melissa? 
SUSAN He wants your show on the air, starring Dahlia. I just got off the phone with her agents. They love it. She loves you. 
GAVIN What about Melissa? 
SUSAN You want me to call her agents? 
GAVIN God no.    I'll tell her. 
Gavin hangs up.   We stay on his side of the conversation. 
In the background, we see the door to the driveway swing open by itself. 
A beat later, it SLAMS shut. 
Gavin is understandably startled.

INT. REHEARSAL STUDIO - DAY 
Melissa, wearing a nun's habit, sings "As Long As He Needs Me." A PIANIST is rehearsing with her. 
MELISSA As long as he needs me, I know where I must be... 
INTERCUT with on-camera INTERVIEW: 
MELISSA (CONT'D) In-between the pilot and the series, I'm trying to squeeze in a one-woman show. (edit) I've always been obsessed with nuns. They're sort of like God's fag-hags. 
Melissa spots Gavin entering and sings the rest of the song to him. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. WEST HOLLYWOOD BAR - NIGHT 
Gavin and Melissa have martinis. 
GAVIN I think my house is haunted. 
MELISSA Your house is really old.

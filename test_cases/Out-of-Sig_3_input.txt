FOLEY I'm a tourist. 
BUDDY You at least bring the gun? 
FOLEY (lifts straw bag) In here with my suntan lotion and beach towel. (points) That's her place. 
As they drive past, Buddy indicates a MAN on the steps out front, obviously FBI... 
BUDDY There.  You see the guy sitting on the porch?  The old ladies and one guy? You know they'll have a couple more in a car somewhere. 
FOLEY (watching something else) Uh-huh... 
Buddy follows Foley's gaze to... 
ACROSS THE STREET 
As a car door opens and Karen Sisco gets out, rifles her purse for change.  She drops a quarter, Foley now watching as she bends down to grab it, her skirt hiking way up her thigh... 
BUDDY Oh, my. 
Foley watches, her hair in her face as she tries to reach under the car and grab it. 
BUDDY (CONT'D) Okay, you saw her.  That's all you get. 
They watch as she walks to the Normandie and shows the YOUNG AGENT her ID... 
FOLEY I guess Adele's in good hands. 
BUDDY Sure looks that way. 
FOLEY (finally) Let's go to Detroit. 
BUDDY Now you're talkin'. 
INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE ADELE'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Adele has the chain on the door, talks to Karen through the narrow opening. 
ADELE You were both in the trunk?  Together? 
KAREN From Glades to the turnpike.  Then I left with Glenn. 
Karen watches Adele's face in the opening, freshly made up, heavy on the eye shadow and lip gloss. 
KAREN The FBI didn't tell you I was with them? 
ADELE They didn't tell me anything, they asked questions. 
KAREN But you know what I'm talking about, don't you?  About Glenn, don't you, and the second car? 
ADELE I know a Glenn. 
She thinks a moment.  The door closes and opens again, all the way.  Adele stands there in a robe, hanging partly open, panties, but no bra. 
ADELE (CONT'D) I'm getting ready to go out.  You can come in if you want, sit down for a minute.  Would you like a Diet Coke? 
KAREN No, thanks. 
She comes in, checks out the place.  She turns a chair from the glasstop table and sits down as Adele comes out of the kitchenette with a Diet Coke and packet of cigarettes. 
ADELE Those are cute shoes.  The kind of jobs I get, I have to wear these killer spikes, they ruin your feet. 
She walks away, comes back with an ashtray. 
ADELE (CONT'D) When you were in the trunk with Jack... 
Karen waits, watches her light her cigarette. 
ADELE (CONT'D) He didn't hurt you or anything, did he? 
KAREN You mean, did he try to jump me?  No, but he was kind of talkative. 
ADELE He gets that way when he's nervous sometimes. 
Adele sits down at the other end of the table. 
KAREN You didn't visit him in prison. 
ADELE He didn't want me to. 
KAREN Why not? 
ADELE I don't know.  He was different after he was sentenced, looking at thirty years.  Said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer. 
KAREN But you spoke to him on the phone. 
ADELE He'd call every once in a while. 
KAREN He called the day he escaped. 
ADELE He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say about me?  In the trunk? 
KAREN (beat, lies) He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life. 
ADELE Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks.  It's all he's ever done. 
KAREN Did you know that when you married him? 
ADELE He said he was a card player.  I could live with that.  I never knew he robbed banks till he got busted with that car that caught fire -- if you can imagine something like that happening, comes out of the bank and the car's on fire. I did go see him in jail to tell him I was filing for divorce.  He said, "Okay."  Jack's so easy going. (then) He was fun, but never what you'd call a real husband. 
Adele looks out the window.  Karen waits, looks to an end table where she sees a photograph of Jack and Adele on a boat somewhere ten years back. 
ADELE (CONT'D) I'll say one thing for Jack, he was never ugly or mean, or drank too much. He was very considerate, lights on or off, if you know what I mean. 
KAREN Really. (looking at the picture) Hm. 
She realizes Adele is looking at her. 
KAREN (CONT'D) Adele, sooner or later, he's gonna get caught.  I'd like to get him before he does something else, makes it worse on himself. 
ADELE Buddy'll take care of him.  Keep him out've trouble.  He's Jack's conscience. Always has been. (chuckles) He tell you how they met? 
Karen shakes her head.

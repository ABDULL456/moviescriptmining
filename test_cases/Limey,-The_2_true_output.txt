Ed takes Wilson inside. 
ED I didn't expect anyone. 
WILSON No reason. 
ED I mean, what has it been -- six months? 
WILSON Round about, yeah. 
They've entered a cauldron of family life.  TV blaring (SHOWBIZ TONIGHT!).  A couple of younger KIDS yelling "Mama". Their MOTHER shouting back at them from the kitchen (in Spanish) that she only has two hands.  A sullen TEENAGER walking by. 
ED I didn't even know who I was writing to -- just someone with the same last name. She never talked about any family. 
WILSON It was better than a telegram. 
Ed opens a screen door to the backyard. 
EXT. ED'S BACKYARD.  NIGHT. 
They sit at an outdoor table.  Wilson with a TV dinner in front of him now too.  Sounds from inside MUTED.  Even this little house has a little pool. 
WILSON Who done it, then? 
ED Huh? 
WILSON Snuffed her. 
Ed surprised at Wilson's directness.  Ed stands nervously. 
ED Now, wait up a second, man. 
And paces back and forth. 
ED I never said nothin' about nothin' like that.  No, no, no.  That's not what I wrote to you. 
WILSON No, but between the lines, eh? Mysterious circumstances, and that. 
Ed stops pacing. 
ED Look, I sent you that newspaper clipping, all right?  I told you what I know.  It was an accident.  I didn't say anything about anybody being "snuffed." 
Beat. 
WILSON This bloke she was bunked up with.  This Terry what'sit. 
ED Terry Valentine. 
WILSON Valentine.  What's he got to say for himself? 
ED I dunno.  What's he gonna say?  They had a fight that night, she drove away, she was upset?  I don't even know the guy. Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were friends, but we didn't travel in the same social circles.  She had her life, I had mine. 
Makes a kind of scoffing gesture:  and you can see what my life is. 
ED Valentine came into the restaurant where I work with Jenny a couple times.  He's a money guy.  Jenny would say, hey, here's my friend Eddie and he would shake my hand and everything, but he wouldn't even see me, you know what I mean. 
Wilson gazes up at the sky.  Clear night.  Stars. 
WILSON How long had she been in the States? (as if to himself, somewhat wistful) Near on ten years, wasn't it?  Long enough to know her way about, I reckon. 
Ed leans down, palms on the tabletop, facing Wilson. 
ED There was an investigation, okay?  The car was totalled.  Jennifer was ... Her neck was broken.  On impact, they said. So she wouldn't have ... felt the effects of the fire. (helpless shrug) It happens up there.  Happens a lot. What more can I tell you. 
Wilson taps out a cigarette from a pack of "Silk Cut" he's produced from his pocket. 
WILSON What more is there. 
ED I'm just sayin' -- it was a steep hillside.  There was no moon that night ... 
Wilson's quiet stillness is getting to him. 
ED Coulda happened to anyone, man.  I never knew her to be reckless.  I mean, sure, she would smoke a little grass, or something, have a few drinks.  But that's it, nothing more than that. 
WILSON No, not my girl.  Self-control, she had. Point of pride. (smokes) And people don't change, do they. 
ED I dunno ... Maybe they do. 
Wilson notes the tattoos on Ed's forearms. 
WILSON Going straight, are ya. 
Ed looks at him.  Sits down again.  Keeping his forearms under the table.

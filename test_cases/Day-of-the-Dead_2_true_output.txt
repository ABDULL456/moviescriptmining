MARY I'd never seen it before. 
JULIE But you knew. 
MARY nods in the affirmative. Tears form in JULIE'S eyes. 
JULIE What else is there, doctor? What else do you people know that the rest of us don't? 
They stare at one another. Whatever bond once existed between them has been severed forever. 
84	INT. A CONDITIONING ROOM IN THE CAVE - NIGHT 
There are CARDIOGRAPHS, E.E.G. MONITORS, AND ALL SORT OF PHYSICAL CONDITIONING DEVICES. On TABLES lie SYMBOLOGY CARDS AND COLOURED BLOCKS for dexterity testing. There are LARGE CUT-OUT SHAPES on the walls, TRIANGLES, SQUARES and familiar ORANGE CIRCLES. 
MARY storms into the room flinging the door shut behind her. RHODES catches it with his BLACK LEATHER GESTAPO BOOT. 
RHODES You can't run away from the planet, Miss Science. You can't even run away from the island, heh heh. 
MARY Leave me alone, you...COCKSUCKER!!! 
RHODES laughs loudly. MARY faces him, hatred boiling away her vocabulary. She can't think of word that are adequate. 
MARY You're....you're disgusting! You're....FILTH! 
RHODES And you're the one who builds the bomb and they says, 'I hope it'll never actually be used'. 
MARY is stopped...by her own guilt. She turns and busies herself gathering books and papers, then she CLICKS OFF A LIGHT and moves toward the doorway where RHODES stands. 
MARY (calmer, with method) Julie Grant is a behaviouralist. She's not medical. She hasn't been as...exposed to...to things...as some of the rest of us. She'll be alright. I'll talk to her. She'll be alright. 
RHODES Oh, I have no doubt. 
MARY (recognising threat in his voice) If you put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson. 
RHODES Ah, yes, our noble Gasparilla does seem to favour you lately. I understand he assigned you a roommate of your choice. The rest of us have to pick names out of a hat. 
MARY (reading his jealousy) Rhodes, you and I had a roll in the hay together when I first got here. It was a wholly unsatisfying experience which I do not want to, and which I never will repeat! So give up, mister! I'm going home...to that roommate you mentioned. 
MARY pushes past RHODES into the hallway. 
85	INT. THE HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE CONDITIONING ROOM - NIGHT 
MARY starts down the hall but RHODES grabs her from behind. He leans in close, lusting, pressing his lips against the back of her neck. 
MARY Take your hands off me! Right now! 
An evil grin returns to RHODES' flushed face. He stares at the woman for a long moment, then he lets go. MARY walks away, bristling. RHODES calls after her. 
RHODES Maybe you'll change your mind when it starts getting too lonely for you. 
MARY stops dead. She turns back to see him gloating. 
RHODES I'm not entirely without influence myself, Miss Science. I had your roommate assigned...by Gasparilla... to my platoon. What's his name? Tyler? Yes. Toby Tyler. 
A bubble of fear pushes up in MARY'S throat but she is only letting her anger show. Her stare is fierce, her eyes daggers. 
RHODES I had an unfortunate little run-in with him today. In fact...you might say that Mr. Tyler is in big trouble with the...authorities. 
MARY You better not mess with me, Rhodes. I'd love to serve your balls to those Red Coats for lunch! Think about it! 
RHODES No, Miss Science. You're the one who needs to do some thinking.

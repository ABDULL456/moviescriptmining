ROPER See this. Solis has me driving the shit-mobile, and he picked this up straight out of impound for fourteen grand. Probably worth thirty. 
MCCALL Police corruption. It's everywhere. 
INT. COMMAND POST - DAY 
Roper and McCall enter. McCall joins the men who are studying the blueprint. Roper stands by Solis and listens, takes note of the poster of Tahiti. Looks inviting. 
SOLIS This will take time to setup. I'll have to get authorizations. (he listens) Okay, you relax, and I'll -- 
Solis pulls the phone away from his ear. Joe has obviously hung up. 
ROPER What do we got? 
SOLIS 32 minutes ago the silent alarm went off, then the fire alarm. A unit was a block away, and the suspect got trapped inside. 
ROPER Any verification on numbers. 
SOLIS We've only seen and talked to one suspect. He calls himself "Joe". There's two jewelers, two salespeople, the manager, a security guard, and an elderly woman. This particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair. They have anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw stones on any given day, so they sure as shit didn't just wander in. They knew what they were coming for. 
ROPER What have you promised them? 
SOLIS Just that I'd talk to my superiors. 
McCall returns from checking out the blueprints. 
ROPER Any good points of entry? 
McCall shakes his head. 
MCCALL The place is designed to be a vault. 
Roper picks up the cellular phone. It dials automatically. 
ROPER (into the phone) My name's Roper. How are you people doing in there? (he listens) Solis is off the job now, Joe. I'm the guy authorized to give you whatever you want. (listens) That's right, but first I need to come down there to talk to you. 
INT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY 
We don't see anything but the suspect on the other end of the phone. He's wearing a ski mask and gloves. Totally unrecognizable to the audience. We will find out soon that he is, in fact, Korda. He appears very cool and collected. 
KORDA You don't have to come here. 
INT. COMMAND CENTER - DAY 
ROPER Yes, I do. That way there's no misunderstandings. I need to make sure no one's hurt, then we can take care of business. 
A long pause... Then a bit sinister. 
KORDA (V.O.) Alright, Roper. You want to come... come. 
ROPER Good. I won't be armed. We gotta operate on trust here. We're going to wrap this up and have you guys out of here as soon as possible. 
Roper clicks off the phone. He already doesn't like the sound of this guy. 
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE JEWELRY STORE - DAY 
Roper, bulletproof vest, hands in the air, walks across the eerily deserted street straight toward the jewelry store. It's quiet now. The choppers have been pulled back. 
Roper reaches the sidewalk right in front of the store. Korda cracks the door open. 
KORDA (warningly) Stay there. 
Roper stops in his tracks. 
ROPER I'm going to put my hands down, okay. 
Roper slowly lowers his hands. 
INT. COMMAND CENTER 
Everybody watching through the window. 
EXT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY 
Korda takes a half step out the doorway. The gloved hand that is visible is not holding a weapon. The other half of his body is hidden inside the doorway. He wears jeans, a black shirt, and black Nike tennis shoes. He stares fiercely from behind the ski mask. There's no sign of fear in him. 
KORDA Are you in charge, Roper? 
ROPER Yep. 
KORDA I want a car. Like a four wheel drive. I want it in perfect condition. I want a uniformed cop to drive it up right here. I want him to leave the engine running and walk to the end of the street. Then we'll come out. I don't want any remote control devices in it. I know all the tricks. If it's not in perfect condition, and I mean if its even low on wiper fluid, I'm going to kill somebody and we're gonna start again. 
Korda lets that sink in. 
KORDA I want a plane waiting at the airport. I'll tell them where I want to go when I get there. 
ROPER Is that all? 
KORDA For now that's all. 
ROPER You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay. 
KORDA No. You just do shit for me right now. 
Korda's eyes glare from behind the ski mask. He's an ominous figure. 
ROPER Joe, I'm doing a lot for you. I think you could give me something to cement the deal... One hostage. 
KORDA I'll give you something. 
Korda pulls a wadded-up handkerchief out of his pocket and tosses it to Roper. Roper unwraps the handkerchief. 
DETAIL SHOT 
It's a human ear.

She moves past MONITORING EQUIPMENT which shows only subtle movement. As she begins to take Cynthia's blood pressure, CAMERA CONTINUES ON INTO THE BED and we see Cynthia, \nShe is now a fully grown young woman in her late 20's.   She is curled up in a fetal ball. \n17   THE YOUNG NURSE                                                 17 finishes her work and then gathers some bottles from the side table. She goes to the door and then REACTS to a SOUND. \nShe looks around, puzzled. Meanwhile, we SEE (and she DOESN'T) that there is INCREASED ACTIVITY on the monitors. \nCYNTHIA (faint, weak) No... no... it's wrong... someone... please help... \nYOUNG NURSE Holy shit... \nStunned, the nurse DROPS the bottles with a CRASH. Recovering her composure, she darts back to the bed, watches flabbergasted as Cynthia continues to STIR, her arms weakly battling half-realized fears. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: The young nurse hits an ALARM, grabs Cynthia's arms to prevent her from pitching out of the bed, and then DOCTORS and NURSES are scrambling all over the room, and as the DIN RISES we \nCUT TO: \n18   INT. HOSPITAL PRESS CONFERENCE - DAY                                18 FLASHBULBS pop and the HOSPITAL SPOKESMAN grins clumsily, famous for fifteen minutes. \nThere's eight or nine reporters here, all of them wishing they were on bigger stories. \nSPOKESMAN (in mid speech) Twelve years, two months...   nine days. \nFIRST REPORTER Is that like a world record for a coma or something? \nSPOKESMAN Actually, no. The longest one on record is 37 years. \nThe first reporter closes a notebook, leaves. \nSECOND REPORTER Does she remember anything about the fire at Universe House? \n19   NEW ANGLE - SHOWING THE BACK OF THE ROOM                            19 Lieutenant (n\u00e9e Inspector) Wasserman is there.    He's grayer, paunchier, but the raincoat is the same one. \nSPOKESMAN'S VOICE (correcting) Unity House. No, she appears to have no memory of the accident itself or the days leading up to it. It's not uncommon after serious trauma. \nTHIRD REPORTER What happens to her now? Have her family or friends been notified? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nSPOKESMAN We stopped looking for any family ton years ago.. Right now we\"re planning to transfer Cynthia to Dr. S.A. Berrisford's Neuropsychiatric Clinic. It's right here on our grounds, and Dr. Berrisford is familiar with both the neuromuscular problems a patient like this will encounter as well as the inevitable mental readjustment that will be required. Thank you. \nThe reporters filter out. \nWasserman is already gone. \nCUT TO: \n20   FOOT                                                                  20 as it is clumsily set down...    another FOOT slides forward. \n21   INT. THERAPY ROOM - WIDER                                             21 Cynthia is standing inside a set of parallel bars. She's pale, weak looking. A PHYSICAL THERAPIST is at her elbow, egging her on. \nTHERAPIST Good... Very good... Come on, just a few more steps... \nCynthia blinks, as if just processing the therapist's word takes some adjustment. \nCYNTHIA (weary) I... I can't... I have to rest... \nBERRISFORD'S VOICE Young lady, you've had fifteen years of rest. \nCAMERA ADJUSTS to show DR. BERRISFORD. In his 50's, avuncular, he wears half-framed glasses and a sweater vest under his medical coat. Two pieces of tissue paper mark his razor's passage on his neck. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nBERRISFORD (CONT'D) Now walk to the end of that platform, or you won't got any chocolate ice cream. \nSomething about Berrisford's mock-stern tone bores in on Cynthia, gets a reaction. She gropes for an answer. \nCYNTHIA (finally) I... I hate chocolate ice cream. \nBERRISFORD Then walk to the end of the platform, or I'll shove an entire gallon down your throat. \nCynthia's eyes crinkle with confusion. And then, ah, she gets it! A joke, the first one in over a decade. She SMILES, and it's a beautiful smile. Setting her jaw, she makes a renewed effort and reaches the and of the platform. The therapist and Berrisford both move quickly to catch her and set her down in a wheelchair. \nBERRISFORD (to the therapist) That'll be all. \nBerrisford begins wheeling Cynthia along. They leave the therapy room, go down a corridor. (Note: Passage as per location.) As they go by other patients and staff, there's a general BUZZ as people whisper about Cynthia. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) \nCYNTHIA I remember... a beautiful sunset. Harris, smiling at me... \nWASSERMAN (writing) Harris, he was the leader? \nCynthia's eyes are far away.    The memories come back...   the words are slow, but vivid. \nCYNTHIA Leader, founder... chief cook and bottlewasher... (smiling) Executive in charge of Dreaming. We were all together... all working to make a now world... That last night, there was a... (brow furrowing) Gathering... a... a sort of... baptism... And then... \nShe winces, rubs her eyes. \nCYNTHIA (CONT'D) I'm sorry, that's all I can see. \nWASSERMAN Miss Weston. This \"Unity House\"... was it a cult? \nCYNTHIA I'm sorry.     I don't understand the question. \nBERRISFORD A \"cult,\" Cynthia. A syndrome of society you have been fortunate enough to miss. They're popular with impressionable people, the penny press... (pause) ...and lazy policemen who like to blame them for crimes they can't solve. \nWasserman closes his notebook, gives Berrisford a cold stare. \nWASSERMAN I was there that night, Doctor. I watched them stack those bodies... (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (4)      WASSERMAN(CONT'D) men, women, children. They looked like 2,000 year old mummies. They broke apart like 2,000 year old mummies. \nCynthia gasps. \nWASSERMAN (CONT'D) If it was an accident... fine. If it wasn't... the person responsible could still be out there. (pause) And he's probably as interested in Miss Weston's memory as I am. \nHe turns, nods to Cynthia. \nWASSERMAN (CONT'D) Feel better. \nHe goes out.   Cynthia's breath comes in short gasps.   Finally she calms. \nCYNTHIA I don't like that man. \nBERRISFORD That makes two of us. \nHe sits beside her again. \nBERRISFORD (CONT'D) But as long as you're here... (smiling) I can keep him away. \nCAMERA TIGHTENS on Cynthia as she considers this... \nCUT TO: \n26   INT. MEETING ROOM - DAY                                           26 The room is cheery, commands a view of the city. A VIDEO CAMERA sits unobtrusively in one corner. Six people sit in chairs in various stages of interest and/or boredom. \nThey are MIRIAM, an attractive woman in her forties, who chain-smokes designer cigarettes; \nCONNIE, smiling, chipper; \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nED, overweight, friendly; \nLANA, pale, worried looking; \nand GILDA, tiny, frightened, withdrawn. She sits with feet pulled up on her chair, arms wrapped around her knees. \nCAMERA ADJUSTS to show Cynthia driving her electric wheelchair into the room and into a place in the circle. \nRALPH stands. Long-haired, with the staccato delivery of a stand-up comic, he smiles. \nRALPH Well, now that we're all here, we can begin. Cynthia, I'm Dr. Goldman, and I'd like to welcome you to our little group. I don't know how much my colleague Dr. Berrisford has told you about my methods. I have my detractors... but I have my successes, too! We're going to get you out of your depression... We're going to got you out of your neurosises... We're going to got you out of that hideous hospital robe and into a flimsy revealing negligee--one with the little holes here? I can see us now on a desert island... You, me, a portable waterbed-- \nAs Cynthia's eyes widen, DR. ALAN GOLDMAN comes into the room, sighs with weary familiarity at Ralph's antics. (Actually, Alan doesn't look much more like a doctor than Ralph.) \nALAN Ralph, sit down and cut out the shit, okay? \nRALPH Dr. Goldman, I was on the verge of a major breakthrough, and you blew it! \nALAN Ralph? (when he sits) Cynthia. I'm Doctor Goldman--at least, last time I checked... (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2)      ALAN(CONT'D) and I doubt if my welcome can equal Ralph's, but I'll try. This is the Borderline Personality Group. And you are now a card-carrying member. \nCYNTHIA What's a borderline personality? \nALAN Gilda hasn't said three words in three weeks. And now, Cynthia comes in with this love, peace and Woodstock routine and... presto. Am I missing something, or what? \nBERRISFORD She's espousing a total belief system. A kind of holistic healing matrix not unlike the dynamic energy shift model. Isn't that interesting? They're adopting it, embracing it. \nALAN Too bad we can't follow through on this. \nBERRISFORD Why not? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nALAN Dr. Berrisford, the people in this group... some of them are deeply disturbed. Cynthia doesn't belong with them-- an experiment for one session, fine, but in the long run-- \nBERRISFORD Alan. We've opened primary channels of communication. You've opened them, Alan. Let's not rush to throw away our progress. Neuroses are hardly contagious. A few weeks in the group won't hurt Cynthia. With luck, she'll overcome her memory trauma. That would mean progress... not to Mention getting Lieutenant Wasserman off my back. In the meantime... \nHe stands, puts his hand on the younger man's shoulder. \nBERRISFORD (CONT'D) She seems to like you. See if you can get her to open up, and let's press on. (pause) With a united front? \nALAN A united front.   Sure. \nSatisfied, Berrisford smiles, goes out the door.     Alan sighs, and looks at Cynthia's image on the screen. \nCUT TO: \n29   INT. PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM - DAY                                   29 Patients in different stages of fitness use the equipment, some with supervision, others on their own. HETTIE, Berrisford's chief nurse--a Selma Diamond type--comes in with a tray of medication in paper cups. She works her way over to where \n30   CYNTHIA                                                            30 is doing log lifts on a bench. She's in a leotard and leg warmers, and there's real color in her face for the first time. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nHETTIE Drop down to first gear, honey. It's Miller time. \nShe fumbles on her tray for the cup marked \"Weston,\" hands the pills to Cynthia along with a cup of juice. \nCYNTHIA What are these? Vitamins? \nHETTIE Beauty secrets from the orient. Look what they've done for me. \nCynthia laughs, takes the pills. Hettie moves over to Ralph, who's just finished doing bench presses. \nHETTIE Ralph, you in a cooperative mood, or do I have to tie you up again? \nRALPH Promises, promises. \nHe takes the pills she gives him, smiles.      She just looks at him, taps his mouth. \nHETTIE Open. \nOf course the pills are still under his tongue. Hettie gives him a shot in the solar plexus and he GULPS. Hettie hands him the juice. \nHETTIE (CONT'D) Next time I hit lower. \nShe moves on to other patients.     Ralph moves over to Cynthia. \nRALPH She's crazy about me. (watching Cynthia's workout) You're coming along. A regular Rocky. \nCYNTHIA Rocky?   The flying squirrel? \nRALPH Rocky the fighting Stallone. (on her blank look) (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2)      RALPH(CONT'D) I keep forgetting you just left the Twilight Zone. Hey, why don't you come up to my room, and I'll bring you up to date. I've got a VHS VCR, a CD, and MTV. \nCYNTHIA You're making this up...      aren't you? \nHe just grins. She slips down to the floor, does some stretching exercises. \nCYNTHIA (CONT'D) Sounds like a complicated world. How do you handle it? \nRALPH Well, whenever it gets to be too much, I just let all of the negative stuff out of my body. \nCYNTHIA You mean with meditation, yoga, what? \nRALPH Nah. I just make a little hole and let it all escape. \nHe pulls open his shirt. On his chest and arms are dozens of scars in neat little rows. \nCynthia swallows, stunned.      Nonplussed, Ralph buttons back up. \nRALPH (CONT'D) Uh-uh, here comes the assistant Ayatollah. See ya. \nMore LAUGHTER. Then Cynthia is RIVETED by the sight of something across the elevator. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nIn the LIGHT of the next strobe like FLASH, we see HARRIS! He is staring at Cynthia. \n33   ON CYNTHIA                                                            33 Staggered, disbelievingly, she moves behind Alan, looks over to the far corner again. \nAnother FLASH. Harris is gone. Suddenly the ELEVATOR JERKS TO A HALT, but the doors DON'T OPEN. Passengers GROAN, annoyed. \nPASSENGER Oh, great-- \nThe emergency BELL starts sounding. Cynthia, still confused, gets shoved against the back wall as the passengers busy themselves pushing buttons. \nCynthia bumps into the man next to her.        She looks up at him. \nFLASH.   It is Harris. \nFLASH. Harris reaches out to Cynthia. She CRIES OUT, jerks away, slamming into Alan, falling to the floor. \nPASSENGER (CONT'D) Jesus, lady, relax! We're on the ground floor-- \nCYNTHIA Let me out! Let me out--! \nFLASH. Cynthia is on the floor. She raises her head. Someone is on the floor right across from her. \nFLASH.   It's Harris.    His face is burned and skeletal.     He GRINS. \nHARRIS Unity, Cynthia...   Now and forever! \nHe has no eyelids or lips. Cynthia SCREAMS, struggles to her feet, knocking over another passenger. Now it's chaos in here. \nCYNTHIA Let me out, let me out!   Alan, help, help--! \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) \nHARRIS Cynthia, you cannot run...      You belong to us Forever--! \n34   ALAN                                                                34 Struggles across the crowded elevator, catches her in his arms. \nALAN Cynthia..? \nThe elevator doors suddenly OPEN. \n35   INT. FIRST FLOOR CORRIDOR - DAY                                     35 Cynthia literally TUMBLES out of the elevator, staggers along the wall, holding herself up. Alan runs out to aid her. The passengers get off the elevator, looking at her oddly. A CUSTODIAN runs up and turns off the alarm. \nALAN Cynthia, what happened--? \nCYNTHIA It's him!     It's him!   He's alive-- \nALAN Who's alive? \nCYNTHIA (pointing) He's alive! Right over-- \nShe stops. The elevator is open and empty. The passengers watch her, some concerned, some voyeuristic. Now they drift away. \nCYNTHIA (CONT'D) (weakly) --there... \nAlan just stares at her. \nCUT TO: \n36   INT. BERRISFORD'S OFFICE - NIGHT                                    36 Berrisford sits, listens intently to Alan. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nALAN --hallucination, flashback, I don't know what to call it- \nBERRISFORD How about psychotic episode? \nALAN No, no, she doesn't fit the pattern-- \nBERRISFORD Addictive personalities can be borderline. You know that-- \nALAN (patiently) She has no history of drug abuse-- \nBERRISFORD There's other kinds of addictions. (standing, pensive) we see it in these fringe religious groups... these instant creeds with pseudo-Messianic delusions. You've heard how she talks about Unity House? Perhaps that's her drug. Perhaps she's going through a--withdrawal of sorts. Her memory lapses about Unity House are equally symptomatic... There's some violent turmoil under that pretty little facade. \nALAN (skeptical) You put her in the Borderline Group and she became one? \n46   EXT. VICTOR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                   46 It's a tacky but cozy building, circa 1958. \"Zeke\" pulls up, rattling to a coughing halt. They get out, head up the steps. \n47   INT. VICTOR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                   47 They come in, turning on lights. It's a dingy couple of rooms, but lush with its variety of objects. Everything looks like it came from the Age of Aquarius: beanbag furniture, paper \"Tiffany\" shades on hanging lights, blacklight posters, hanging macrame planters. \nCynthia loves the room and everything in it. But she is particularly drawn to a canvas on an easel in the far corner. \n48   PAINTING - HER POV                                                48 It's of her, sitting serenely in a meadow, the Unity House perched prominently on a hill in the distance. (In the doorway, the bare-chested FIGURE of a man may--or may not--be barely visible.) Cynthia's clothes in the painting are the ones she wore in the opening scene. \nBut her face is that of today's Cynthia. \n49   BACK TO SCENE                                                     49 VICTOR I... did it by memory. I tried to imagine... what you'd... look like today. Guess I came pretty close. \nCYNTHIA It's beautiful. More beautiful than I ever was. \nVICTOR (softly) Then you need a new mirror. \nshe smiles, flattered.    Suddenly a CAT jumps up on a crate. \nVICTOR (CONT'D) That's Chairman Meow. \nCynthia picks him up.    Victor takes out a bottle of tequila and two glasses. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nCYNTHIA You still haven't told me how you lived. I really can't remember anything about the... accident. \nVICTOR It wasn't an accident. \nShe stiffens.    His eyes are far away. \nVICTOR (CONT'D) A lot of people back then, they hated Unity House. Hated Harris and his dreams... dreams of peace... of oneness. That hate fed negative energy into the cosmic vortex... Something bad was bound to happen. That hate was so strong... so envious of what we had... \nHe has SQUEEZED the shot glass in his hand so hard that it EXPLODES. Cynthia JUMPS, and that's when he notices it. \nVICTOR (CONT'D) (very normal) Oh, fuck-- \nCYNTHIA You've cut yourself-- \nShe comes over, binds his hand with a dishcloth.     He holds onto her. \nVICTOR I guess talking about the past can be a little dangerous. \nHe pours a shot into the remaining glass. \nVICTOR (CONT'D) Let's drink to the present. (pause) To us. \nHe SIPS.   Passes the glass to her. \n50   CYNTHIA                                                            50 She hesitates...    smiles.   Drinks. \nThere is a drop of blood in the glass.     She doesn't see it. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nCYNTHIA To us. \n51   BACK TO SCENE                                                      51 VICTOR (quietly) To... Unity. \nHe pulls her close. They KISS... she seems to malt in his grasp. The cat jumps down. Slowly they kiss and touch each other. They stop and stare into each other's eyes. \nHe moves his hand over her shoulders, neck, through her hair. She is completely his. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n52   INT. BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT                                    52 Half a dozen candles illuminate the room. \nCynthia and Victor are making love. Not violent, but slow, passionate, dreamlike. They are completely enjoying each other. The satisfaction seems spiritual. They stare into each other's eyes the entire time. They are lost. \nGradually Victor's rhythm builds. As his momentum increases, as the ecstasy nears, Cynthia accelerates too. Heaving, gasping, they are approaching a beautiful climax. \nBut just when it seems Victor is on the verge, the very threshold, he stops and JUMPS violently out of bed. \nVICTOR Oh Jesus! \nCYNTHIA Victor? \nVictor paces around the room, practically bouncing off the walls. \nVICTOR Oh, my God. I can't believe it. What a great idea...! Too amazing! Too amazing! \nVICTOR Yeah, oh yeah...     oh, YEAH-- \nA SHOT sounds.   She SCREAMS-- \nCUT TO: \n53   INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT                                                53 Cynthia BOLTS up out of bed. \nCYNTHIA No! \nThe candles are out.    Victor isn't in the room. \nCynthia, drenched with sweat, slowly catches her breath.      She looks around, confused. \nCYNTHIA (CONT'D) Vic? \nShe goes into the other room. \n54   INT. LIVING ROOM                                                    54 No Vic. It is dark except for a FIRE in the fireplace. The flames REFLECT oddly on the slick surface of the oil painting of Unity House. \nCYNTHIA Vic? \nShe checks in the kitchen. Nothing.       She looks back in the bedroom. The apartment is empty. \nShe's just calming when--MEEOW! The CAT LEAPS out of nowhere, startling her, and then running out of sight. \nShe swallows. Very nervous now, she sits on the couch and starts pulling on her jeans and shoes. The CAMERA MOVES AROUND her, revealing the entire apartment. We see EVERY ANGLE. It is completely quiet and still. The CAMERA SETTLES at one ANGLE on Cynthia. A shadow behind her MOVES. \nVICTOR Where are you going? \nCynthia JUMPS from fright. \nCYNTHIA Jesus, Vic. I thought you... left. \nVICTOR Me?    Leave you all alone? \nHe pulls her into his arms.      She hesitates. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nCYNTHIA Vic?   Vic, are you... happy? \nVICTOR That... (kissing her) ...has to be.. (kissing again) ...the stupidest question I ever heard... \nHe keeps kissing, caressing. \nCYNTHIA I mean... with... life.   With... being alive. \nHe looks at her oddly. \nVICTOR What are you talking about? \nCYNTHIA (relaxing) Never mind... I had this... bizarre dream... \nVICTOR Welcome to reality. \nHe touches her soft face. He runs his hands down her neck. They kiss again, she now completely without reservation. Their embrace is so all-encompassing that, when she opens her eyes, it's only then that she SEES \n55   CLOSER                                                             55 She is kissing a BURNED AND SCARRED FACE WITH ONLY CLUMPS OF PUPPY BLACK MUSCLE HANGING ON THE BONE. It is Harris' face, the face we saw in the elevator. Cynthia GASPS, fumbles backwards off of the sofa. \nVICTOR (CONT'D) What's the matter? \nShe looks back up at him.     He's Victor again, normal again. \nVICTOR (CONT'D) Cynthia? \nShe knocks over a tequila bottle. It's spilled all over the floor. She is speechless. He picks the bottle up. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nVICTOR (CONT'D) Why did you pull away? \nCYNTHIA I...    I think I'd better go. \nVICTOR Why? \nShe's over by the door.    Victor comes and presses against it so she can't get out. \nCYNTHIA Please let me out. \n68   INT. BEDROOM - DAY                                               68 Alan looks and sees the closet as she described it. \n69   INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY                                           69 CYNTHIA (as he comes back out) Well? \nALAN Cynthia, a double closet isn't exactly a positive I.D.-- \nMANAGER What are you two talking about? You wanna rent, or what? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nCynthia looks around, suddenly points to a stain on the rug, triumphant. \nCYNTHIA There! There, look--that's where I spilled the tequila... (on her knees, desperate) See? See? It's still wet! \nMANAGER (apologetic) Hon, I think that's from the ceiling... \nCAMERA TILTS UP. There is, indeed, a corresponding damp spot directly above the one on the rug. As we WATCH a DRIP plops down. \nMANAGER (CONT'D) ...damn plumber was supposed to fix it last week. (smiling) So! We in business? \nCUT TO: \n70   INT. BERRISFORD'S OFFICE - DAY                                      70 Wasserman SLAMS his hand down on the desk, furious. Cynthia JUMPS, squeezes Alan's hand. Berrisford sits quietly, leans forward and picks up the pan holder Wasserman has displaced. \nWASSERMAN Twelve hours! You wait twelve hours to tell me about this? Am I supposed to be grateful for your civic-mindedness? I told you the Unity House case was still open-- (pointing at Cynthia) --and she's the only lead. You should have called me the minute you found out-- \nBERRISFORD (calmly) Found out what? Lieutenant, if I called the police every time one of my patients experienced a fantasy or a delusion, you'd have to move in here-- \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nCYNTHIA (sharp, stepping forward) It was not a delusion! Victor Lunes was here-- \nBERRISFORD The security guard didn't see anyone-- \nCYNTHIA Then the security guard needs glasses! Alan, tell them-- \nALAN (on the spot) The apartment did match her general description-- \nWASSERMAN --a one bedroom flat with a beige rug... that's rather... generic. \nCYNTHIA --Victor isn't generic-- \nWASSERMAN Victor is dead! Dead for fifteen years-- \nCYNTHIA --you've seen his body? \nWASSERMAN --it was burned beyond recognition-- but there was I.D.-- \nCYNTHIA I knew it--I knew it- \nALAN Cynthia. Look... we've all done it... tumbled out of bed positive that we've just lived something that was only a dream-- \nCYNTHIA (firmly) Damn it, it wasn't a dream--I was out there-- \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nWASSERMAN No one's denying you flow the coop, Miss Weston... You wanna prove the rest? Lemme get a policewoman to stand by while a gynecologist checks out your plumbing. We'll see soon enough if your ghost left a calling card-- \nCynthia hauls off and gives Wasserman a tremendous SLAP. \nCYNTHIA You bastard. \nShe goes to the door, looks at the doctors. \nCYNTHIA (CONT'D) You... (searching) --experts! \nShe goes out, SLAMS the door.    Wasserman rubs his jaw, checks his mouth. \nBERRISFORD Wonderful! Wonderful! I've been waiting and waiting for her to finally show real anger--real emotion! This could be a breakthrough! (sincere) Thank you, Lieutenant. \nWasserman holds a filling in his fingertips. \nWASSERMAN Hey.   Anytime. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THERAPY ROOM - DAY \nCAMERA PANS past a row of PILLOWS. We WIDEN, see that each member of the group has a big pillow in front of them. \nSNAP.   Drip. \nHARRIS (CONT'D) ...You have no choice... \nHe takes the match and strikes it through the pile of nails. \nThe nails scatter. \nHARRIS (CONT'D) ...Come to us, Cynthia. It's time to die. Don't lot another take your place. Come to us... now. \nThe match is lit.    He throws it off. \n76    SLOW MOTION                                                     76 It FALLS through the air. Lands on the soaked carpet.   An EXPLOSION of flames. They RUSH TOWARDS CYNTHIA-- \nCYNTHIA NOOOOOOOOO--! \nIt is a blood-curdling and heart-stopping a scream as ever heard. \nThere is a FLASH of light. \nCUT TO: \n77    INT. THERAPY ROOM - DAY                                            77 Cynthia's SCREAM trails off as she THROWS herself back from the pillow. \nThe Unity House Members and Harris are all gone. \nThe group therapy people all turn to her in amazement. \n77A   MIRIAM                                                            77A Open mouthed, she DROPS the match she's holding to light a cigarette. It SIZZLES on the rug. Alan STOMPS it out, rushes over to Cynthia, who SAGS in his arms, \nCUT TO: \n77B   INT. ALAN'S OFFICE - DAY                                          77B Cynthia sits in a crumpled sprawl in Alan's office. The room is decorated in comforting tones, with Sierra Club posters and outdoors-y souvenirs. The late afternoon sun steams in through the partially closed blinds. \nAlan sits beside Cynthia on the couch, concerned.   Berrisford sucks on his pipe, makes notes. \nWasserman, rocking on the legs of his chair, jots in his own little notebook. \nCYNTHIA (softly, tense) ...They... they sang songs as they stacked up the white containers... they were... happy. Because it was going to be their break with the world... a world that didn't understand them. I don't remember if they took a vote or if Harris just... decided. But they all agreed. They were... happy... smiling... laughing... crying from happiness as he drenched them in the gasoline... \nWASSERMAN (under his breath) --Jesus-- \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nCYNTHIA Somehow, I... I knew it was wrong... I ran... When he threw the match, I was at the other end of the hallway... There was a flash... and a... like a wind, or the hand of God--picked me up, threw me... The ceiling fell in... When I opened my eyes... (she looks up) I was here. \nHettie appears in the doorway, tray in hand, raises her eyebrows inquisitively at Alan. Alan nods immediately: Hell, yes. Hettie comes in, gives Cynthia her medication. \nWasserman closes his book, looks thoughtful. \nALAN (to Wasserman) If that's what happened, why didn't you find any evidence of arson? \nWASSERMAN The plastic jerry cans would've burned up before anything else... We knew there'd been an explosion... We just didn't know how or why. \nBerrisford stands, approaches Wasserman as the police officer closes his book, moves to the doorway. \nBERRISFORD Well. You must be pleased. Closing a case after... what is it, twelve years? \nWASSERMAN Who says it's closed? \nThe medical people look at him.      Cynthia's thoughts are elsewhere. \nALAN What's that supposed to mean? \nWASSERMAN When the fairy princess here woke up, she said she didn't remember anything about 32 deaths. Now she remembers they committed suicide... (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2)      WASSERMAN(CONT'D) but she, of course, was innocent. Who knows what she'll remember tomorrow? Running for help... or pouring gasoline on the fire? \nHe goes out. \nHETTIE That man's a candidate for shock therapy... with a car battery right to the cojones. \nCYNTHIA No... he's right.     I am guilty. \nThey look at her, startled. \nCYNTHIA (CONT'D) I'm guilty of lying... to Unity House. I promised to be part of it... Forever. They expected me to keep my word. (pause) They still do. \nShe stands, goes out. Alan and Hettie look worried. Berrisford looks... unsurprised. He turns to Alan. \nCYNTHIA Yes. (to Miriam) See you later. And...     thanks. \nMIRIAM Thank you. \nMiriam then gets into the elevator.         The doors remain open, Alan turns to Cynthia. \nALAN How are you feeling? \nCYNTHIA Fine. \nALAN Good. \nHe heads off in the opposite direction. Cynthia watches him. She turns back towards Miriam. Miriam is alone in the elevator except for one other person. \nMiriam smiles and waves. \nCynthia smiles and waves. \nFrom behind Miriam, Harris, all burned and puffy, smiles and waves. \nThe elevator doors close. \nCYNTHIA No! \nAlan whirls around.       Cynthia rushes to the elevator. \nCYNTHIA (CONT'D) Miriam!    Stop! \nShe bangs on the buttons. She pounds on the doors.          Everyone in the corridor turns to look. \nALAN Cynthia? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nHe starts to approach.   She runs to a stairwell. \n93   INT. STAIRWELL                                                      93 Cynthia sprints down a flight.    She goes out onto \n94   INT. HALLWAY, ONE FLIGHT DOWN                                       94 Cynthia runs to the elevator and pounds on the button, but the elevator car has already passed. \nCYNTHIA (yelling into the door) Miriam, get out! \nShe races back to \n95   INT. STAIRWELL                                                      95 She flies down the steps.    We can hear ALAN tailing her. \nALAN'S VOICE Cynthia! \nShe swings around a turn into a flight and trips.     Suddenly she's ROLLING DOWN A \n96   EXT. HILLSIDE - NIGHT                                               96 She SLAMS into a tree.   We see the Unity House in the distance. \nVOICE Cynthia! \nANOTHER VOICE She's trying to get away! \nThere are PEOPLE pounding through the brush all around her. She gets up and runs along the path into the forest. \nVOICE Cynthia! We want you to stay with us! You mustn't be afraid! \nShe is in total panic, running blindly. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nCYNTHIA Please, no. \nBranches thrash her face. She can barely see where she is going, but she comes to a halt when she reaches a dark precipice, a cliff which seemingly has no bottom--just black as night. \nThe people are getting nearer. \nFEMALE VOICE She's over here. \nWe see someone nearing through the brush. \nHARRIS No pain, Cynthia. There's no pain. Come with us. Share with us. Take my hand. \nCynthia looks down the cliff. \nORDERLY'S VOICE Take my hand. \nREPORTERS (rapid fire) Doctor Berrisford, are you cooperating with the police? Dr. Berrisford, do your patients have a history of violence? \nBERRISFORD Ah... I have work to do.    No further questions. \nAnd--flustered for once--he leaves the room. \nCUT TO: \n107   INT. CYNTHIA'S ROOM - NIGHT                                        107 It is raining.   Cynthia sits in bed, in the dark. \nWe see the CHARRED AND BURNED HARRIS sitting across the room in a shadow. Cynthia looks over at him. \nHARRIS You're in pain, Cynthia. \nHe reaches up to his face, and peels off some skin.    It CRACKLES and oozes. He peels off more. \nHARRIS (CONT'D) Your pain is my pain. We share it all, because we have our love. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED:             HARRIS(CONT'D) Our love will never die. Don't make me take another of your friends. Keep your promise, lovechild. Join me. \nShe stands, fumbles for the switch, knocks over a glass, and turns on the light. \nHe is gone. As she stands there in shock, a HAND touches her shoulder, spins her around. She GASPS-- \nIt's Alan, who's just opened the door.        He looks at her, worried. \nALAN I didn't want you to be alone. \nShe sways, dizzy, sags in his arms. \nALAN (CONT'D) Looks like I was right. \nCUT TO: \n108   INT. CONNIE'S ROOM - NIGHT                                             108 Connie is sitting on her bad. She takes her pills from Hettie dutifully. Ed comes in. \nHETTIE What are you doing here? \nED You know me at feeding time. \nHe takes his meds from her, smiling. CHEWS THEM loudly and sloppily until she grimaces and goes out. \nThen, the minute the door closes, Ed and Connie are in each other's arms. They kiss like characters in a Harlequin Romance. \nCONNIE (coming up for air) Why didn't you tell me before that you were a Prince of Ancient Atlantis? \nED It slipped my mind ...    your Highness. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nShe kisses him passionately again.    He breaks the clinch, pulls her towards the door. \nED (CONT'D) They'll have bed check soon.   I know a better place. \n109    INT. CYNTHIA'S ROOM - NIGHT                                       109 Alan site on the counter across from Cynthia's bed.    He plays with the hinged mirror on the wall. \nALAN I don't know if you want to hear this or not, and frankly, I don't care. \nAs he toys with the mirror, we see a CANTED REFLECTION of first Cynthia and then the hallway. A nurse passes by. \n109A   ON CYNTHIA                                                        109A As she listens. \nALAN (CONT'D) You are no more responsible for those deaths twelve hours ago than you are for the ones twelve years ago. \nSomething catches her eye. \n109B   IN THE MIRROR                                                     109B Connie and Ed walk by. \nALAN (CONT'D) Thinking otherwise is putting you in a self-replicating spiral of depression. And that puts me in a bind... What do I do, write more prescriptions? You need to face reality, not get medicated out of it... \nCynthia GASPS.    HARRIS HAS APPEARED IN THE MIRROR, following Ed and Connie. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \n109C   BACK TO SCENE                                                      109C Cynthia jumps up, heads for the door.

She is underneath another larger vent with a fan spinning inside. Everyone in the hall ignores her. \nHARRIS' VOICE Cynthia, you must reach out and embrace our love for you... You must reach out to me... \nWe see Harris now, behind the fan, in brief flashes of light, burnt then normal, gazing down at Cynthia. He reaches towards her. \nCYNTHIA Where are Connie and Ed? \nHis fingers ARE SLICED OFF BY THE FAN.       He takes no notice. \nHARRIS They're with us now. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nWe hear SPLASHING. Cynthia looks over. Gallons of blood and solid matter pour out of the ceiling vents all down the hall. \nCYNTHIA Where are they? (she is frantic) Where are Connie and Ed?   Where are they? \nAlan wonders at the pouring red, then he hears Cynthia screaming. He runs down the hall to stop her. \nThe patients and nurses watch the blood pour in horror. Cynthia is getting more and more hysterical. \nCYNTHIA (CONT'D) Where are Connie and Ed? \nAlan corners her. \nALAN It's all right--it's all right-- \nSuddenly, out of nowhere, a BL00D-COVERED BODY careens into them, driving them apart! \n123A   ANGLE                                                           123A It's Edgar, covered with blood, in a total state of shock. \nEDGAR --horrible--sweet Jesus--help me-- \nAlan struggles to restrain him.

What is it? \nRALPH Nothing. I just came to tell you-- (smiling, conspiratorially) Everything's gonna be okay. \nCYNTHIA What's going to be okay? \nHe goes into the bathroom and rinses his blood-soaked hand.

He grabs a paperweight, SMASHES THE GLASS. \nRON Hey--! \nAlan pulls out the tray, scans it. He grabs Ron by the collar, shoves the files into his face. \nALAN Read it.   Pesco, Ralph-- \nRON He's dead-- \nALAN READ IT!   What's he down for? \nRON Ah, Lithium--four times a day-- \nAlan grabs the tray, holds up a pill. \nALAN Is that Lithium? \nRON Fuck, no--that's Endoral--the complete opposite--one of those, even a normal person would flip out-- \nALAN Tell me about it-- \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nAlan looks at the tray and its compartments labeled for Lana, Miriam, Ed... all the others. Alan GRABS them all. \nALAN (CONT'D) What's this? And this?      And this? \nRON This is, uh, dextroamphetamine... Christ, take one of these and you can walk on the ceiling. Holy mother. Methylphenidate! Don't mass with that fucker. Clonodine! Chlorapromazine! Preludin? Shit, I didn't know they still made that... Two of these and Mother Teresa would turn into a maniac! \nBERRISFORD Dr. Goldman. \nAlan turns around. \nBerrisford bashes him in the head, neatly slicing off some skin. Alan flies against the wall. \nThe gun is knocked away. \nAlan writhes a little, then dips into unconsciousness, \nCynthia is a basket case.     She looks at Alan. \nCYNTHIA No...   no... no... \nBerrisford comes to her and starts giving her an injection. \nShe calms herself.     She looks at him dreamily. \n191A   CYNTHIA'S POV                                                       191A She sees Harris gazing at her lovingly. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nHARRIS Only one thing matters. \nShe touches his face. \nCYNTHIA Our love.     We'll be together.   All of us. \nBerrisford taken Alan's gun. \n192   INT. CYNTHIA'S ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER                        192 Alan comes to. The ALARMS and BELLS are still ringing. Cynthia and Berrisford are gone. \nALAN Shit! \n193   INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT                                             193 The corridors are run amuck with isolation patients (the worst kind) all escaped from their rooms. Alan runs out of Cynthia's room. He is surrounded by bizarre-looking people screaming, singing, dancing, praying. \nHettie is by the stairway helping Isolation patients exit. \nHETTIE One at a time! No pushing!      Please do not use the elevator! \nAlan is frantically looking for Cynthia and Berrisford, checking everywhere, pushing open doors. \nThe security guards are at the far end of the hallway.    Alan goes to Hettie. \nALAN Where's Berrisford? \nHETTIE This is your fault! These goddamn doors won't re-lock! \nALAN (furious ) Where is he? He's going to kill Cynthia! Tell me where he is! \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nHETTIE I haven't seen him! \nThe guards see Alan.      They come after him.   He runs. \nAlan scans every room. He slams into patients. The guards aren't far behind. Alan turns a corner, passing a door marked \"NOT AN EXIT: ROOF ACCESS.\" It is ajar. He goes in without the guards seeing him. \n194   INT. STAIRWAY - NIGHT                                                 194 It is dark, but the red lights FLASH. He runs up several flights. The landings face onto the outside with a railing, open, no glass. \nHe turns a corner.      Cynthia is there. \nShe in perched on the outside of the railing, a serene expression on her face, the wind blowing her frail white gown. \nAlan freezes.      He moves towards her slowly, hands outstretched. \nALAN (soothingly) Cynthia, take my hand... Just relax... Think about what you're doing... Stay calm... I want you to take my hand... \nShe watches him blankly.      She turns to someone behind Alan. \nCYNTHIA It's so beautiful. \nAlan turns. There on the stair above is Berrisford, his face dancing in the flashing red light. \nALAN (to Berrisford) You piece of shit! \nCynthia lets go. \nAlan reaches out. \nALAN No! \nCYNTHIA S...stop it... Stop it! \nBerrisford SHOOTS. One of Alan's finger joints is BLOWN AWAY. He SCREAMS, his grip loosens, and he SLIDES down the railing. Berrisford moves several yards to stay close... begins to POUND on Alan's mutilated hand. \nALAN Cynthia, don't let him kill you! Don't let him do this! \nCYNTHIA Unity... It... it's my destiny... I've fought it too long. Right or wrong... my death has a purpose... It will close the book. End the story. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) \nALAN Your life has a purpose... to bring joy and happiness! You're part of my life now. That's an unfinished story, too... \nShe looks at Berrisford viciously pounding on Alan's hand. \nCYNTHIA Let me up.     Stop it. \nShe starts to climb up, but she can't. \nCYNTHIA (CONT'D) Let me up! \nBERRISFORD I'm afraid it's too late for that. \nAlan's grip on her slips down to two fingers. They CRACK. She yells from the pain. She swings in the breeze. \nAlan is weakening.   He is losing consciousness.   He knows he is about to die. \nGUARD Dr. Berrisford? \nSuddenly Berrisford freezes. \nHe is paralyzed at the sight of one of the guards coming up the stairs. Berrisford backs away glaring. \nAlan GROANS.   The guard rushes over. \nGUARD (CONT'D) Jesus (Yelling down the stairs) Gomez, get up here! \nThe other guard appears. \nThey start helping Alan up by Pulling his arm. As they help him up, Berrisford, in a state of shock, backs further up the wall. He leans against the wall and puts the gun to his head. He trembles. He pulls the trigger. \nCLICK. \nCLICK, CLICK, CLICK. Out of bullets. The others are too busy to be noticing what he in doing. Just as they pull Cynthia to the edge, she looks up to see: \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (4) \nBerrisford coming to the railing, and jumping, calmly. Silently. \nGUARD (CONT'D) Holy shit. \nCynthia numbly watches him fall.    Then she in pulled up and over... \nCUT TO: \n200   INT. HALLWAY - OVERHEAD - NIGHT                                 200 Cynthia is plopped over onto a gurney. Lights are passing her. She is being whisked down a hallway. She is descending into a haze of unconsciousness. \nDOCTOR'S VOICE I need a detox prep! Stat! \nCYNTHIA It was him... \n201   INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT                                            201 Alan runs alongside the gurney with doctors and nurses. He clutches bloody bandages to his hand, tries to hear Cynthia. \nALAN It's okay. It's over. It was Berrisford. He killed them. \nCYNTHIA Then all those other things... Faces... voices? They were...      in my head? \nALAN It was Berrisford. He shot you up with hallucinogens. What he didn't do, you imagined. \nThere is joy through her delirium. She is just able to clasp hands with him briefly before she disappears behind a set of double doors. \n202   EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY                                         202 A new station wagon whisks along the pretty road. \n203   INT. STATION WAGON - DAY                                             203 Alan drives, Cynthia looks at a map.       They both look relaxed. They both have bandaged hands. \nCYNTHIA Go right if that's the interstate. Yeah, it is. \n207   EXT. UNITY HOUSE - DAY                                               207 Through the greenery are the charred and overgrown remains of Unity House. A chiseled sign embedded into a tree verifies it. Alan and Cynthia pull up, park. Cynthia gets out and looks around. She goes to the front entrance. Alan follows her in. \nCynthia gives a final look around at the deteriorated structure and turns down the stairs. \nShe stands at the top of what remains of the stairs. \nWe FOLLOW HER DOWN. Just as she nears the bottom, the TICKING of a clock is audible. It gets LOUDER. Cynthia reaches the last stop and turns into \n215   INT. FOYER - NIGHT                                                215 We FOLLOW HER with a CONTINUOUS PAN. The foyer is new now, completely untouched by fire, just as it was at the beginning of the film. A candelabrum is lit. \nCynthia turns and we PAN BACK TO THE STAIRCASE. It is new, unburnt. Two KIDS come scrambling down the stairs laughing. \nThe entranceway, the archway to the front room, the staircase are all intact, just as we saw them in the opening scene. \nCYNTHIA peers into the kitchen. Two WOMEN in work aprons are kneading bread dough, chopping vegetables. They smile at Cynthia. \nWOMAN 1 Cynthia!   Are you staying for supper? \nCynthia is silent, wide-eyed, taking it all in.    She turns towards the front door. Victor is coming in. \nVICTOR Cynthia.   It's good.   Come in. \nShe in unable to resist. \n216   INT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT                                           216 They walk in. The room is filled with people. There is a fire in the hearth. Children play. Candles illuminate the space. Unity Members smile and great her casually as she passes them. \nMiriam in talking with a BEARDED MAN intently. \nMIRIAM Cynthia, I'm so glad you're here. \nEd and Connie are by the fireplace with some others.    They smile at Cynthia knowingly. \nLana is sitting contentedly on the window seat reading with some children. \nRalph is crouched with victor in a corner.    They are laughing warmly. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nGilda comes up to her. She is ebullient, happier, healthier looking than we've ever seen her. \nGILDA Cynthia, it's so wonderful here, but we miss you terribly. \nCynthia nears Harris. He smiles at her and kisses her. Everyone in the room turns to her. Harris holds up a shiny and sharp knife with ornamentation on the handle. Cynthia doesn't see it yet. \nHe puts the pointed tip against her chest. \nHARRIS It's time, Cynthia.    It's finally time, isn't it? \nEVERYONE Yes. \nCYNTHIA (fighting the vision) You don't exist. \nHARRIS I wouldn't say that. (he touches her) Go on. Take the knife. \nShe can't escape his gaze. \nHARRIS (CONT'D) Do it.   You know you want to. \nGILDA You know you do, Cynthia. \nVICTOR You'll see how beautiful it is. \nSOMEONE ELSE You will. \nCynthia clasps her hand around the knife at her chest, Harris lets go. She holds it there by herself, completely hypnotized by his words, by his eyes. \nMIRIAM Cynthia, we're only telling you this because we love you. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nHARRIS Beautiful lovechild. All will be in balance when you've joined us. All will be right when daughter is with father. \nSOMEONE You're special, Cynthia. \nSOMEONE ELSE Scared blood... daughter of the father. \nCynthia in mortified. \nCYNTHIA I'm...? \nHARRIS Now you remember. \n", "test1_input": "BAD DREAMS \nWritten by \nAndrew Fleming & Steven E. de Souza \nFADE IN: \n1   EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - SUNSET                                         1 A serene landscape, mist collecting as the red ball of a sun dips behind the mountains. \nIn the middle of a field stands a bare-chested man facing the sunset. He is HARRIS, forty-ish, greying but handsome, and very fit. His hands are outstretched as if embracing an invisible entity. He seems filled with some sort of transcendental power. Now, an air of fulfillment and resolve settles over him. He turns and walks away from us. CAMERA ADJUSTS and reveals-- \n2   EXT. UNITY HOUSE - LONG SHOT - SUNSET                             2 Once the home of Victorian Gentry, a few seasons of amateur repair work have not compensated for decades of neglect. But now as Harris walks towards it, the fading daylight and long shadows turn it into a fantasy castle. MUSIC ECHOES faintly from within; it's \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\" by Iron Butterfly. If the music didn't place the era for us, the battered VW MINIBUS parked outside the house does; it's covered with flower paintings, slogans, and the ubiquitous peace sign. \nAs Harris approaches the house, a dozen or so YOUNG PEOPLE rush to greet him and embrace him. Extending his arms out to enclose them all, he goes inside. \n3   INT. COMMON ROOM - SUNSET                                         3 This was probably a stately parlor in its day. There is a funky assembly of odd handmade furniture. There are muslin curtains on the windows, crude paintings, and quilts covering ripped chairs and couches. Despite the squalor, there is a neatness to the place. Now, the CAMERA begins to ROAM through the room and down the hallways lined with fading wallpaper. \nVOICES (various) --where did she go...? ... was here a moment ago... Cynthia, come on, honey, we need you... Cynthia, come out, come out wherever you are... the sun's going down, we're losing the moment...! (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED:             VOICES(CONT'D) Hey, mellow out, we got ten minutes, I like, checked the almanac, okay...? Ready or not, here we come... \nAll these comments are made in relaxed and good natured tones. Finally the CAMERA PANS OVER to a little storage alcove beneath the servant's stairway. A HAND reaches in and opens the door, and inside we SEE cartons, antique toys... and then CYNTHIA, a pretty 13 year old girl who wears funky clothing and a haunted, nervous expression. \nVOICES (CONT'D) ...There you are, you naughty girl! You almost made us lose the sunset... Come on, honey, time's wasting... \nShe shrinks back from the HANDS that are pulling her up and out, but they prevail, and she's up and on unsteady feet. The CAMERA stays with her as she's led back down the hallway. \nCYNTHIA (faintly) No, please... I... I really don't want to do this... Can't I just wait for you..? I--I'm not sure about this-- \nA SET OF HANDS moves in, separates Cynthia from the others. \n4   NEW ANGLE                                                        4 Revealing VICTOR, a handsome youth a few years older than Cynthia. \nVICTOR Easy, Cyn, easy. You don't want to do this, that's okay... right, Harris? \nThe VOICES stop as everyone awaits an answer. CAMERA PANS across the common room, to the end we haven't seen yet. \nIn the center of the room is a big cistern or font. As we watch, Harris has just DUNKED someone in it. The person steps out, laughing, sloshing in amber liquid. Standing around are other people, some already dripping wet, others awaiting their turns. Some are clothed and wet, others in varying degrees of undress. It all seems slightly off, slightly eerie, despite their smiles and cheer. Harris splashes himself with the amber liquid from the tub, pushes his hair back. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nHARRIS No, Victor, it's not okay. Here at Unity House, some things have to be done... (slight smile) ...in Unity. This is one of them. \nHe WADES CLOSER to the CAMERA, within reach of Cynthia, Victor and the others. Smiles again. It's the kind of a smile that inspires trust. \nHARRIS (CONT'D) Cynthia, do you trust me? \nShe nods immediately. \nHARRIS (CONT'D) And have I ever lied to you? \nShe shakes her head. He GESTURES. The people around Cynthia begin to GET INTO the tub. Some remove their clothing; others get in clothes and all. Toddlers and infants are held by their parents and playfully splashed. \nHARRIS (CONT'D) Then I say to you now... to all of you now... that this will be the Ultimate Joining... of man and woman... parent and child... humanity and Godhead. \nHe looks at Victor, who reluctantly lets Cynthia's hand go, gets in. Now only Cynthia remains. \nHARRIS (CONT'D) Cynthia. Come. There is no shame in this. No crime. No sin. Just the final break with the old world... As night falls, we start a new day... a day of Unity. (a command, but warm) Come to me... my lovechild. \n5   ON CYNTHIA                                                     5 His last words melt her remaining resistance. Moving like a sleepwalker, she steps into the tub, wades forward. Then she stops, looks down at the fluid lapping at her jeans... runs her hand through it. Her eyes widen. \n6   EXT. HOUSE - LONG SHOT                                             6 The sun almost gone now, red light reflecting on the gabled windows. Even the battered VW van looks good in this setting. It's beautiful. \nCYNTHIA'S VOICE No!   No... \nHARRIS' VOICE Cynthia, come back! We can't do it without you... We must have unity, my lovechild... Unity, now and through eternity... Cynthia, you cannot run... You belong to us forever--! \nPause. The faint SOUNDS of SPLASHING and then FOOTSTEPS skittering on tired wooden floors... and then-- \n--UNITY HOUSE EXPLODES! \n7   EXPLOSION - ANOTHER ANGLE                                          7 WINDOWS blow out. Splintered BEAMS propeller through the air. The VW camper on the lawn ROCKS with the shock wave. Then a SECOND EXPLOSION blows the Victorian cupolas and widow's walk off the roof. From somewhere in the distance we HEAR SIRENS... \nCUT TO: \n8   EXT. UNITY HOUSE - NIGHT                                           8 FIRE is CONSUMING what's left of the building. Rescue workers and firefighters are running back and forth. \n9   INSPECTOR WASSERMAN                                                9 A plainclothes detective, he NODS to some uniforms, steps around some debris to move closer to the scene. He puts his collar up against the SPRAY which leaks from firehose connections. Seeing one of his men, he SHOUTS over the din. \n", "test1_true": "POLICEMAN Twenty-four bodies, Inspector. Maybe more. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nAs he says this, both men watch as firefighters carry out a SCORCHED AND BLACKENED CORPSE that looks like a 3,000 year old mummy. \n10   CORPSE - CLOSER                                                  10 It's set down on the ground beside other blackened bodies partially covered by tarps. As the body is set down it CRUNCHES, and a piece BREAKS OFF. \n11   BACK TO SCENE                                                    11 Wasserman blanches, wipes his mouth. \nWASSERMAN Cause of fire? \nOFFICER Some kind of explosion... gas main, methane, too soon to tell. God only knows. \nWASSERMAN Let's hope He doesn't keep it to Himself. \nA VOICE We got one! We got a survivor! Get a stretcher and oxygen over here, STAT! \nWasserman and the cop run up the slope with the others. \n12   RUINS - CLOSER                                                   12 Medics run around the parked VW, which drips water and chemical foam. Rescue workers move a FALLEN BEAM and pull a soot-blackened form out of a hole. As the CAMERA PUSHES closer, we see that it is Cynthia. Her clothes are torn and singed, and she is unconscious, but as they work on her we see that she is largely unharmed. \nVOICES (busy, frantic) Make room, make room! Get that airway in! I got a pulse, whoa, it's faint... Talk about lucky, she musta fallen in the basement... First and second degree burns... Come on people, move your asses! \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nWasserman tries to keep up as they carry her on a stretcher towards an ambulance, put her inside. It ROARS AWAY, SIREN WAILING.

He said he'd take someone else, and he did... She wanted my help... my friendship... That's why... he took her... \nShe's out cold. Behind the doctors, in the doorway, the other clinic patients press close, curious. Hettie pushes them out and down the hallway. \nHETTIE Move it, people, this ain't a sideshow... Get back to your rooms... \nAlan looks down at Cynthia with genuine concern.    But Berrisford eyes her totally clinically. \nBERRISFORD (thinking aloud) Fascinating.

Unity House at its apex must have been a classic matrix of belief impression overlaid on collectivity-- (exciting himself) That would indicate she's symptomatic of a hypothetical Borderline Personality syndrome among cult followers, all externalizing their anxiety!

Lot of good it'll do Lana. \nHE SMASHES his fist on the counter, denting it.

You know what's bad? Burning. When I was in the great Fire of London, well, let me tell you-- \nHearing this, Cynthia chokes back a sob, jumps up and leaves the room.

They waited while I was in a coma... He told me that if I didn't join him, he would take someone also... and he did it, Miriam, he did it! \nMiriam gets up, her face a mixture of sympathy... sympathy and something else. She lights a cigarette. Involuntarily, Cynthia FLINCHES at the spark. \nCYNTHIA (CONT'D) You...   you don't believe me, do you? \nMIRIAM I believe that you believe it. And I also believe that shooting you up every time you get the heebie- jeebies ain't gonna do shit for your real problems. We gotta get you out of here--get you to some nice place at the beach or the mountains where you can fight your demons in your own way. Right? \nCYNTHIA But I don't know anyone.

Well, some people called it a rag, but it was home: ME! Magazine. You heard of it? \nCYNTHIA (shaking her head, diplomatic) I was in a coma. \nMIRIAM Oh, right. Well, when they took me off to the funny farm, Saul--he's the editor--he said I was always welcome back. Maybe this is the time. See, if I can go to him, tell him your story, I could get a big advance... I'd share it with you, and we'd be set! I mean, girl, your story has everything... death, hospitalization, weird rituals, maybe a little romance-- I've seen all those longing glances between you and Goldman- \nCYNTHIA What--! \nMIRIAM --and now with poor Lana we got a little mystery. Hell, you're not an article, you're a goddamned mini- series! \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) \nCYNTHIA I...   I don't know... \nMIRIAM Cynthia, let me be honest. This is a great story, and it means a second chance for me, so, okay, there's some self interest here. But I really think you need to tell people about Unity House... about the way decent ideas and dreams got twisted into something sick and poisonous. You owe it to the world. You owe it to yourself.

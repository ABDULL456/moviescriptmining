SWANN (V.O.) They'll never find out. 
Harry looks up. 
Svanrt is hovering in the air above him.  The veins in his temples bulge and throb.  This trick requires a lot of concentration. 
HARRY Look, Ma, no wires. 
SWANN You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour. 
HARRY How the fuck do you do that? 
SWANN Now I'm going to have to kill you. 
HARRY I don't think so.  You need me alive. 
SWANN Why?  So you can fuck my wife? 
Swann swoops down towards Harry, who levels his gun. 
HARRY Be careful.  Funerals make me trigger-happy. 
Swann stops, inches from the ground. 
HARRY You know, it's such a fucking waste.  You can do shit most of us can only dream about, and you go around pretending it's some trick. 
SWANN Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get burned. 
HARRY Or murdered, like Nix. 
SWANN He deserved it. 
HARRY Maybe he doesn't see it that way. Maybe he's digging his way out of the hole you put him right now.  That's what you're hiding away from, isn't it? 
SWANN I did it for Dorothea. 
HARRY Oh yeah? 
SWANN Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's off her. 
Harry grabs Swann, literally pulling him down to earth. Now they're face to face.  Eye to eye.  Swann, for all his posturing, is afraid. 
HARRY So Nix won't come looking for her? 
SWANN It's me betrayed him. 
HARRY And she shot him I  I think that'd piss me off if I were Nix. 
SWANN (despairing) I don't know what else to do. 
HARRY Help me. 
On Swann, his face a churning mass of rage and fear. 
HARRY Listen.  If he's back from the dead, then he is some kind of god. And he'll find you, wherever the fuck you are. And if he's just another phony Messiah, then you can stage the greatest come-back in history. 
ON Swann.  This doesn't sound like such a terrible idea. 
EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON 
A car comes to a halt outside the house, where six vehicles are already gathered.  The SNAKE-HANDLING Cultist gets out. SNAKES seethe out of the open car door. 
INT. NIX'S HOUSE - VARIOUS - LATE AFTERNOON 
We MOVE THROUGH the shadowy interior, catching sight of several CULTISTS as we go.  They all have looks of barely suppressed ecstasy on their faces. 
We are moving towards the Sanctum, and it's getting darker. A MATCH is struck, and an OIL-FLAME sputters into life.  We see NORMAN'S gleaming face. On the wall is a PICTURE of Nix, floating over a scene of apocalyptic destruction. 
Norman brushes away thirteen years' accrual of DIRT. Beneath, Nix's expression is as rabid and terrifying as ever.  Norman grins. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. LIQUOR STORE - LATE AFTERNOON 
A small, garishly-lit liquor store.  Harry's car pulls into the lot.  Swann gets out, his disguise back on. Heads into the store.  Harry, agitated and impatient, follows him. 
INT. LIQUOR STORE - LATE AFTERNOON 
Swann is at the cashier's desk, with a bottle of cheap brandy. 
SWANN Is this the best brandy you've got? 
CASHIER If that's what's on the shelves. 
Swann produces a thousand dollar bill out of thin air. 
SWANN Can you change a thousand for me? 
CASHIER (amazed) You're shittin' me. 
HARRY Can we go?

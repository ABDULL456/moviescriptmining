CRAWFORD (over his shoulder to Lounds) Get the hell away from here, Lounds! CUT TO: INT. DINER, BOOTH - GRAHAM + CRAWFORD - DAY Graham is staring into the black deep recesses of his coffee. Crawford is looking at him. Finally: 
GRAHAM ...snuck in the hospital while I was sedated, flipped back the sheets and shot pictures. The only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls... 
CRAWFORD I know... 
Graham looks away. Then he lights another cigarette. 
GRAHAM (back to business) Atlanta and Birmingham can run the thumb print against known sex offenders. Five will get you ten they don't come up with an identification. Jimmie may in the Finder program... if he's ever been printed and in his Index. 
CRAWFORD Say we've arrested a good suspect. You walk in and see him. What is there about him that doesn't surprise you? 
GRAHAM I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me. 
CRAWFORD You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print. .. 
GRAHAM. Don't expect too much from me, Jack, all right? (pause) We'll get him one way or the other. 
CRAWFORD What's one way? 
GRAHAM We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever... (beat) If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him. 
CRAWFORD We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It's a haystack. (beat) What's the other? 
GRAHAM He makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time. 
CRAWFORD No other possibilities? 
GRAHAM You think I'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?' That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about. (MORE) 
GRAHAM (CONT'D) (beat) The Tooth Fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. He won't stop. 
CRAWFORD Why? 
GRAHAM Because he has a genuine taste for it, Jack. 
CRAWFORD See? You do know something about him. 
GRAHAM (long stare at Crawford; then) ... I'm going to see Lecter. 
Crawford's cup of coffee stops in front of his mouth: 
CRAWFORD For Christ's sake, why? 
GRAHAM (matter-of-fact) To recover the mind set. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - GRAHAM - DAY 
In the middle of packing. Then the PHONE RINGS. 
MOLLY (V.O.) Hello, hotshot! 
GRAHAM Hey, baby! Where are you? 
MOLLY (V.O.) At the store. You doin' some good? 
GRAHAM None you'd notice. I'm lonely... 
MOLLY (V,O.) Me, too. And very erotic... 
GRAHAM Tell me about yourself. 
MOLLY (V.O.) Which part? That or the day-to-day. 
GRAHAM (laughs) Let's keep it the day-to-day stuff. (beat) How's Kevin? 
MOLLY (V.O.) Kevin's fine. He had to recover the turtle eggs you two fenced in. The dogs dug them up. Tell me what you're doing. 
GRAHAM Eating junk food. (beat) They don't have a lock on anything, Molly. There's not enough information. Or I haven't done enough with it... 
MOLLY (V.O.) Will you be in Atlanta for a while? I'm not buggin' you about coming home, I just wondered. 
GRAHAM Z don't know. I'm goin' up to Baltimore this afternoon. 
MOLLY (V.O.) To do what? 
GRAHAM I have to see somebody. 
There is a silence. Graham does not want to tell her that he is going to see Lecter. Molly stays cool, she doesn't 
pursue it. 
MOLLY (V.O.) I'm thinking about painting the kitchen. What color do you like, Will? Are you there? 
GRAHAM (coming back) Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow. 
MOLLY (V.O.) Yellow's a bad color for me. I'LL look green at breakfast. 
GRAHAM Blue, then. 
MOLLY (V.O.) Blue is cold.

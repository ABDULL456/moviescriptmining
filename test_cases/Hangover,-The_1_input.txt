ALAN (CONT'D) Oh, hey Becky! Hi! He steps away to take the call. Vick explains to Carla: 
VICK That's his girlfriend of 14 years. I'm sure this'll only take a minute... 
Vick and Stu go back to looking at the wedding photos as Alan tries to talk to his furious girlfriend. 
INTERCUT WITH: 
BECKY in her Laura Ashley bedroom, angrily packing up her suitcase. She's beautiful and preppy in pearls and a sweater set. 
BECKY Can you tell me why all the goddamn credit cards are maxed out?! 
ALAN No! I-I have no idea--! Then Vick calls over from the white plastic table, pissed: 
VICK 
HEY ALAN, HOW COME I WASN'T YOUR 
BEST MAN, DUDE! 
STU 
YEAH, WHAT THE HELL, ME EITHER! 
WHY'D YOU PICK DOUG?! Alan waves at them, shut the hell up! But Becky has heard. 
BECKY "Your best man?!" What's going on there, Alan?! 
ALAN Nothing! Baby, nothing, the GUYS 
ARE JUST BEING DICKS! 
VICK 
HEY ALAN, YOU WANT ALL YOUR WALLET- 
SIZED WEDDING PHOTOS, OR CAN I 
BOGART A FEW?! Alan furiously flips them off, shut up! 
BECKY I really don't appreciate being mocked right now, Alan, especially about wedding-related issues. You know how hard this weekend is going to be for me. 
ALAN I know, baby! I know-- 
BECKY So you'll call the credit card company and straighten this out? 
ALAN Yes. I will. I promise. 
BECKY Okay. Okay... (beat, calming) Look, sorry I'm so tense... I'll see you soon, okay? Love you. But Alan is just staring at the BRONZE SHIELD of him making out with his blonde bombshell wife... 
BECKY (CONT'D) Alan? Hello? I said I love you?! 
ALAN Yes, no, I love you too! Becky hangs up, rolling her eyes, unbelievable. STAY WITH ALAN as he closes his cellphone. Exhales. 
STU Hey, how's Becky doing, man?! 
VICK Yeah, did she ask about us?! Off of Alan's hate-filled glare, we 
CUT TO: 
STEVE AND THE GUYS SCHLEPPING ALL OF THE WEDDING CRAP through the strip mall parking lot, back to their car. Alan sullenly carries the GIANT BRONZE SHIELD. 
STU Look on the bright side, Alan. Vick found a great clue. 
VICK Turns out Doug was in all the wedding photos, which means -- if the time stamp was right -- we had him in our possession until 11 pm. 
STU That's another hour of last night that we can account for. Isn't that great?

Andrew holds out said wrapper in front of the camera. 
MATT That's like, at least twice as much blood as I usually see on a taco bell wrapper. 
STEVE Guys, guys. Look. 
The camera moves around to show the woman returning to the space where her car was parked. She stops, baffled, and looks around. We hear the guys stifle laughter. 
She notices her car parked up ahead and walks over to it, looking around. Andrew tries to get a better angle, and she notices him, and stares. 
STEVE (O.S.) (CONT'D) Ignore us! 
MATT (O.S.) We're (beat) Mormons! 
The woman stares a moment longer, and goes to her car. 
INT. MATT'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER 
Matt's driving, Steve's shotgun, Andrew filming from the back. It's raining. 
MATT -sfucking insane, we just changed her life. We did- 
ANDREW (O.S.) Her face, I can't get her face out of my head. 
STEVE That was fucking great. I mean, this just gives me so many ideas, already, stuff we could do- 
There's honking from outside. 
MATT Oh come on, what is this? 
STEVE He's like right on your bumper, too. 
Matt rolls down the window and gives the signal to pass. More honking. 
MATT Can you fucking believe this guy? 
STEVE He's just some asshole redneck, look at him. He's fucking with us. 
They are driving out over a bridge in the woods. 
MATT I don't know what to do, what should I- 
ANDREW (O.S.) (laughing) Here, take the camera, take the camera. 
He hands off the camera to Steve; now we see Andrew sitting in the back seat. Behind him, through the back window, we can see a pick-up truck, honking, way too close. 
ANDREW (CONT'D) Abracadabra. 
Andrew flicks his hand at the truck. The effect is instantaneous: THE FRONT OF THE TRUCK CAVES IN LIKE IT JUST HIT A BRICK WALL, WHAM, AND SENDING IT CRASHING OFF THE BRIDGE, OUT AND DOWN AND INTO THE WATER. STEVE (O.S.) ...I...what... 
EXT. THE BRIDGE 
The camera is being held loosely at Steve's side; everything's upside-down, and we can't see anything, but can hear the guys are clearly freaked out. 
MATT (O.S.) What the fuck did you do, man, what the fuck- 
ANDREW (O.S.) I didn't mean to, I didn't- 
MATT (O.S.) Fuck! SHIT! What's wrong with you, look at this, fuck! 
STEVE (O.S.) Is he still in there? If he's in there we have to get him out-

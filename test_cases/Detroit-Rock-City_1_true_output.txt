Amanda caresses Hawk's cheek. He turns with her hand and kisses it. He takes her arm and begins kissing his way up to her neck, her cheek, her mouth... 
DR. LOVE TO THE RESCUE 
INT. SMILEY MART - NIGHT 
It's a stand-off. Prone customers look up at Trip and the man with the long coat circling each other like sharks. The helpless cashier lets out fearful sobs. 
MAN WITH COAT Gimme your gun, boy! 
TRIP No, you gimme your gun, boy! 
MAN WITH COAT Don't tempt me, I'll shoot! 
TRIP Not if I shoot first! 
MAN WITH COAT I don't even think you have a gun! 
TRIP Neither do I! 
The man with the coat puts his shotgun against Trip's head. 
MAN WITH COAT Now, for the last time, take the piece out and lay back down or your mom's gonna need the White Tornado to get the brains outta your ski cap. 
Trip GULPS. The jig's up. He slowly pulls out Stretch Armstrong, and the man with the coat glances down and starts to laugh very loud. So loud, he throws his head back. 
When he recovers, Trip's got Stretch aimed at his head and pulled back to maximum tension. 
TRIP Smile, you sonofa... 
Trip lets go. WZZMACK! The man gets it right in the face and falls backward onto the Hostess display, toppling a whole bunch of Ho-Ho's, Ding-Dong's, Twinkies, and Suzy-O's to the ground. 
Trip runs up and grabs the shotgun away as the man with the coat lifts his head briefly, then passes out. 
Trip turns around and the cashier SLAMS into him, nearly knocking him over. She throws her arms around him letting out relieved SOBS. Behind her all the customers rise from the floor CLAPPING. Trip did it. He saved the fucking store! 
The cashier looks into Trip's masked eyes. 
CASHIER Thank you! Thank you!... Who are you? 
TRIP (with confidence) Call me... Dr. Love! 
She plants a thousand mega-watt kiss on his lips and we ZOOM IN on her mood ring changing color from gray to fire engine red. 
Trip's eyes widen just before... KABOOM... The shotgun he's holding goes off, blowing a hole in the ceiling. 
The recoil from the blast jolts Trip and the cashier apart. We now see Trip's face is smeared with bright, red lipstick. A huge chunk of ceiling falls onto his head but he doesn't move. The kiss hit him harder. 
I'M HERE FOR THE GIRL AND THE CAR 
INT. CHOP SHOP - NIGHT 
BZZZZZ! Christine and the beefy jerks watch the brown, '78 Volvo, Ohio plates: OB-GYN, ascend on a hydraulic lift. 
Behind them sits the BMW skeleton. These boys work fast. 
CHRISTINE You guys better kill me before you do what you're thinking of doing. Cause when I'm mad enough, I can bite down very hard. 
The beefy jerks laughs. 
BEEFY JERK #1 Sweet Polly Purebred's got some spunk, huh? 
BEEFY JERK #2 I'll give her some spunk alright. 
They put their blow torches down and turn to her. 
BEEFY JERK #1 We stripped that Beemer in fifteen minutes. Bet we can strip her in fifteen seconds. 
They giggle maniacally and lumber toward Christine. Their shadows growing larger and larger across her. 
CHRISTINE (mile a minute) Now wait a minute, guys! Two against one ain't fair. Lemme go back and get my friend Barbara. You'd love her. Tits the size of your head. You'll feel like a little baby sucking on 'em. I swear, I'll bring her right back. It'll be a four-way... You guys like disco? I teach disco dancing at my church. You guys look like you got rhythm in your blood. Come on, free lessons if you let me go. 
BEEFY JERK #1 I know a dance we can do. The horizontal hustle. 
They both laugh. Just as they're about to grab her... 
Suddenly, the garage door behind them SLIDES UP revealing darkness. Christine and the beefy jerks look out anxiously.

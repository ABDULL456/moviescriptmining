One cop stays with the lady, the other rushes inside. 
89   INT. CINEMA - NIGHT 
The cop enters a side door to find several bloodied corpses.  He hears something, looks over to see the Wolf hunched over a victim.  The Wolf turns, eyes blazing, mouth dripping with blood.  We see it clearly for the first time.  It is truly a hound from hell, its wolfen features a hideous sight.  Its eyes fierce, burning green.  The Wolf roars and starts for the cop. The cop rushes out and slams the door behind him. 
90   EXT. CINEMA 
As the cop bolts the door shut. 
COP #1 For God's sake, Tom, there's a monster in there! The doors shudder as the Wolf begins to batter them down.  The cops strain to keep them shut. 
COP #1 Call for assistance and tell them to bring guns. 
Pedestrians start milling around.  The door is bulging. The Wolf's roars continue. 
COP #2 Keep moving!  Will you people get out of the way! 
91   INT. DR. HIRSCH'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
Alex is asleep.  Dr. Hirsch wakes her. 
DR. HIRSCH Nurse Hobbs said there's a disturbance in Leicester Square involving some sort of mad dog. 
ALEX David? 
DR. HIRSCH I doubt it.  But it's something to do. 
92   INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT 
An officer unlocks a rack of rifles which are distributed to uniformed men. 
93   INT. CINEMA - NIGHT 
Police cars arrive, sirens blaring.  Officers are pushing the crowd back as other men help hold the door closed against the Wolf's battering. 
Another police car pulls up and out steps Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus. 
LT. VILLIERS What the hell is going on here? 
COP It's some kind of animal, sir. We.... Suddenly the doors splinter apart and there stands the Wolf, eyes blazing.  It leaps on Lt. Villiers, savaging him.  The crowd falls back in panic. 
The Wolf runs into traffic, a cab swerves to avoid hitting it and plows into fleeing pedestrians hurling one through a shop window.  Mass confusion as orders are shouted and the police pursue the Wolf. 
It runs down an alleyway into a cul de sac.  It stops in the darkness, blocked by a brick wall.  The Wolf whirls around, defiant, roaring.  The cops quickly barricade the entrance to the alley. 
94   INT. TAXI - NIGHT 
The taxi is halted by the traffic jam in Leicester Square.  Police vehicles roar past. 
ALEX David!  It's David! 
She jumps from the car before Dr. Hirsch can stop her. 
95   EXT. CUL DE SAC - NIGHT 
The police arrive with weapons and efficiently ring the alley.  Alex runs to them. 
ALEX Let me through! 
COP Stand clear, miss! 
ALEX I must get through! 
Alex dodges the cop and runs into the alley.  The officers shout after her.  Dr. Hirsch reaches the police line. 
DR. HIRSCH Alex!

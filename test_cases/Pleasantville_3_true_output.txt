DAVID (CONT) You got the admissions letter. 
JENNIFER Right here. 
DAVID And you're sure about this? 
JENNIFER I've done the slut thing, David. It's really kinda old. 
David nods. 
DAVID I'll come back and check on you in a month. 
Jennifer nods and gives him a hug. She holds on tight for a couple of seconds. 
JENNIFER You're like the coolest brother in the world. 
David smiles. Never been called cool before. They suddenly hear the SOUND of a motor and look to their left. A huge Greyhound bus lumbers up the highway, pulling to a halt at the sign. The doors open beckoning her in. Jennifer smiles at her brother, then turns toward the door ... 
EXT. MARGARETS HOUSE. DAY. 
She clutches her umbrella at her side. David holds a bag of oatmeal cookies. Each one clings on to the other one's clothing. Their faces are inches apart. 
MARGARET You're gonna forget about me. 
DAVID No I won't. I swear. 
Margaret nods. She looks at him for a moment then wraps her arms around his neck. They meet in a long, rich, wet, soft kiss. The umbrella falls to the ground ... 
MARGARET (a whisper) I like calling you David. 
DAVID I like it too. 
INT. PARKER LIVING ROOM. 
David stands in front of the television with Mr. Johnson at his side. He holds the remote control in his hand. Mr. Johnson seems pretty amazed at the whole idea. 
MR. JOHNSON Well how do you know it won't go back to the way it was? 
DAVID You're gonna keep painting aren't you? 
Mr. Johnson nods. 
DAVID (CONT) Well ... 
He nods again and thinks about it. They smile at each other one last time. 
MR. JOHNSON (remembering something) Oh. (reaching into his pocket) I've got something for you. 
He pulls out a folded piece of paper. Mr. Johnson extends it to David who unfolds it and instantly smiles. 
INSERT. PAPER. 
It is a small painted replica of their mural in the same vibrant colors. Everything is scaled perfectly, exactly like the one on the wall. 
SHOT. DAVID. 
DAVID It's beautiful. 
MR. JOHNSON Just a little--You know. 
David looks up at him and smiles. All at once he glances toward the door. 
WIDER. 
Betty is standing there holding a brown paper bag. A sweater is draped over her arm. 
BETTY (extending the bag) I made you these for the trip. They're marshmallow rice squares. 
DAVID Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ... 
BETTY (painful/ quieter) I had to say goodbye. 
She looks up at David and their eyes lock. Betty hands him the bag. 
BETTY (CONT) There's a meatloaf sandwich in there too. Don't go skipping dinner just 'cause you're not here anymore. 
DAVID I won't. 
BETTY (voice quivering) And ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold. 
DAVID (nodding) ... It's a pretty short trip. 
She nods as well. Betty puts the sweater around his shoulders anyway and fusses with the collar for a second or two. Then she throws her arms around his neck. 
BETTY I'm so proud of you, Bud. 
DAVID Thanks ... I love you. 
BETTY I love you too. 
She clings on tight for a second or two then lets go. Betty flicks away a tear and draws a deep breath. 
BETTY (CONT) Well ... 
She steps back and looks at him. David glances down at the remote. 
DAVID You better stand back a little. 
Betty and Mr. Johnson cross toward the comer of the room. David points the remote at the TV ... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MODERN HOUSING TRACT. DAY. 
All the ersatz Spanish houses stretch out toward infinity. A WESTEC security patrol cruises by them at a crawl. A second or two later, all the sprinklers turn on in uniform synchronization. 
INT. DAVID'S LIVING ROOM. 
He stands in the middle of the living room looking at his new/old surroundings. Everything is the same as it was. The black onyx coffee table. The clean burbur rug. The big screen TV in its sleek black cabinet. David looks at it and smiles. The place is inadvertantly in black and white. 
CLOSER.

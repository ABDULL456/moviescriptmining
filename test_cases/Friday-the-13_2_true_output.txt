BILL (continuing) There's the problem, Jack.  Wire worked itself loose. 
He starts to wind it round a set-screw in CU. 
JACK Just in cause this bugger goes bad.  I'm gonna pick up some lanterns from the equipment shack. 
JACKS walks away. 
CUT TO: 
63    INT. EQUIPMENT SHED - DUSK 
The door opens at us, letting in the limited light.  JACK comes in and goes to pick up a fluorescent lamp.  He flicks it on. As he bends down to pick up two Coleman lanterns, the CAMERA slowly moves toward the wall where once we saw all the hatchets and knives.  They are all missing. 
JACK takes his booty and exits. 
The light is gone and we are alone in the dark. 
CUT TO: 
64    INT. KITCHEN - DUSK 
ECU of the lightbulb over the kitchen area.  It flickers on as we hear in the BG the sound of the generator start up.  The bulb glows, goes down, glows cheerily. 
NED What hath God wrought? 
BRENDA That was the telephone. 
NED Ha!  You wily oriental!  The phone was "Mr. Watson, come in here, I need you." "What hath God wrought" was the telegraph. 
JACK comes in with his lanterns followed by BILL. 
MARCIE Last line of Gone With the Wind? 
NED Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn! 
ALICE listens as she washes the dishes.  It looks as if things will be okay. 
BRENDA Shows how much you know.  It's something about tomorrow. 
ALICE Tomorrow is another day. 
BRENDA Right!  Right! 
MARCIE is finishing up making her green California dip. 
Suddenly ALICE cries out.  Everybody whips around to see. ALICE holds up a piece of broken glass--the bottom half of a bottle.  She has cut her finger.  It is not a serious cut, but the blood is visible. 
ALICE This just plain ain't my day. 
BILL reaches into a cupboard and pulls out a BandAid. 
MARCIE                        NED You okay?                     Those things can be nasty. 
BRENDA Wash it out real good. 
BILL comes up to ALICE. 
BILL Lemme see.  Doesn't look too bad. 
That said, the OTHERS go back to what they were doing. 
BILL and ALICE are featured even though we can hear the others. BILL takes great care and puts the BandAid on ALICE's finger. 
They share this moment with soft smiles as the trivia contest continues. 
NED Who played the role of Gorgon in Star Trek?

NIX (to unseen Cultists) You see, I escaped the grave. So I have to give something to the grave in return. 
On the Cultists, listening to their lord with love in their eyes. 
A SLIT OPENS in the middle of Nix's forehead, above the bridge of his nose (this is an image we saw in the prints in the library), and from it comes a WAVE OF DARKNESS.  As Nix REVOLVES, the darkness STRIKES the GROUND around the Cultists. 
At first they don't realize what's going on.  They think this is some kind of bizarre blessing. 
Then the ground starts to LIQUIFY beneath them. 
NORMAN What's happening? 
NIX I have to give something back. So I'm giving you. 
They're starting to SCREAM now as they sink into the ground. They struggle, of course, but the earth seems to be hungry for them.  They are dragged down, THRASHING as they SINK. 
BARBARA (sobbing) Why?  Why? 
NIX You're not worthy.  None of you. Only Swann was worthy. You just waited like lambs. 
Harry appears in the doorway.  Nix, still swinging round, has his back to Harry. 
NIX Well I'm not your shepherd. 
Harry surveys the horrific scene in front of him.  The ground is now re-solidifying around the Cultists, some of whom have disappeared from view completely, some of whom still reach up out of the dirt.  The scene has a surreal beauty to it despite its horror.  SCREAMING FACES locked in the solid ground.  TWITCHING HANDS the same. Harry starts towards Nix and Dorothea, GUN levelled.  So far, he has avoided Nix's gaze. 
INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT 
Butterfield and Swann are locked in a life-or-death struggle. They tumble back against the table upon which Nix was resurrected.  It collapses under them, and for a moment Swann is stunned.  Butterfield snatches up one of the instruments and STABS at Swann, who rolls out of the way in the nick of time. 
The BLADE catches him in the arm, however. 
SWANN Aah! 
BUTTERFIELD Go on, bleed. (he slashes at Swann again) Go on!  Go on! 
Butterfield comes after him, and Swann backs off against a wall.  He SPITS out a serpentine FLAME, which races across the floor and leaps at Butterfield's face! 
BUTTERFIELD (screaming) No! 
He falls backwards, his face ON FIRE.  Swann doesn't wait to watch him die, but races out into the passageway, BLOOD running from his wound. 
INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT 
Harry is staring up at Dorothea as he very gingerly crosses the still-sticky ground.  He's a yard from the edge of the pit now. 
Nix swings round. 
NIX You're not Swann.  Who are you? (a beat) ) Oh... I know what you want. He lets Dorothea slip from his arms. 
Harry flings himself towards the hole and CATCHES HOLD of Dorothea's arm before she falls away into the abyss.  His GUN goes spinning across the ground, back towards the door leading to the passageway. 
DOROTHEA Oh God! 
HARRY Hang on! 
Nix reaches down to torment Harry.  But before he can make contact 
SWANN (V.O.) Nix! 
Nix looks up. 
NIX There you are. 
Suddenly, Nix isn't interested in Harry and Dorothea. He steps onto solid ground, and walks towards Swann, his tone suddenly conversational. 
NIX I've had a lot of time to think about you.  Where I went wrong... 
With Nix's back turned, Harry pulls Dorothea back out of the chasm. 
SWANN And? 
NIX I should have been honest with you, right from the start.  I wasn't born to show people the error of their ways.  I was born to murder the world. 
ON HARRY, as he leads Dorothea to the door.  Harry glances back into the room. 
NIX You could still help me do that. 
SWANN Why would I want to? 
NIX Because you've got nothing else to live for. 
SWANN Not true. 
NIX The woman has a new love in her life.  Your friends are dead. Nobody's left to save you, but me 
He lays his hands on Swann.  Draws him into an embrace. 
ON HARRY and Dorothea.

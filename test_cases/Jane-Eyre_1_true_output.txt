Jane is delivering Adele into the centre of the company. 
JANE May I present Miss Adele Varens? 
ADELE Bon jour, mesdames, monsieurs. 
Jane finds it hard to get a proper impression of the guests, as she cannot raise her eyes to look at them. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 64. 
Adele makes a dainty curtsey - pink frock, hair in ringlets, little lace gloves. In the midst of the crowd is Blanche. 
BLANCHE Why, what a little puppet. 
LADY INGRAM (mutton dressed as lamb) Is this your ward, Mr Rochester? 
ROCHESTER Yes. 
LOUISA ESHTON (English rose; nineteen) What a love of a child. 
Adele blissfully disappears into a moving sea of dresses. Only one guest is still looking in Jane's direction; Blanche. Her lip curls in distaste. 
Jane backs into a nearby window seat; always her place of refuge. She closes her eyes. A great Atlantic wave hits the sash window behind her, drenching it with foam and brine. 
When she opens her eyes, Rochester is in her line of vision, standing out in a crowd of unmanly men. He senses her gaze; glances at her. Jane looks down, pulling her work on to her lap; a beaded purse. She does not lift her eyes from the beads, fully feeling the humiliation of her class - and of her love. Blanche sidles up to Rochester. 
BLANCHE I thought you weren't fond of children? 
ROCHESTER You're right; I'm not. 
BLANCHE Then what induced you to take charge of that little doll? 
Rochester turns away from Jane. 
ROCHESTER She was left on my hands. 
BLANCHE Why don't you send her to school? 
ROCHESTER She has a governess. 
Jane glances up; sees Rochester's back to her, throws her eyes down, once more. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 65. 
BLANCHE You should hear mamma on the chapter of governesses. I had half a dozen in my day - all detestable, ridiculous incubi - were they not, mamma? 
LADY INGRAM Did you speak, my lily flower? 
BLANCHE I said governesses. 
The reaction is instant. 
LADY INGRAM Oh, don't mention them; the very word makes me nervous! I've suffered a martyrdom from their incompetence and caprice. I thank heaven we're now done with them. 
BLANCHE I have just one word to say of the whole tribe; nuisance. 
Jane's fingers sew. Only the briefest flash of her eyes towards the company shows her mortification. Blanche has started playing a brilliant prelude on the piano. 
BLANCHE (CONT'D) We shall have music - and new subject, if you please. Signor Eduardo, what shall it be? 
ROCHESTER Donna Bianca, I give you beauty. 
BLANCHE Beauty? Why there's nothing new to be said. I give you back male beauty. Mamma, what's your idea of male beauty? 
LADY INGRAM My son, of course. 
LORD INGRAM Hear hear. 
BLANCHE Oh, Tedo's quite typical of the young men of today. They're so absorbed in the pursuit of fashion that they've forgotten how to be men at all. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 66. 
LORD INGRAM I say - 
BLANCHE A woman who neglects herself is a blot on humanity. But a man should pay no heed to his looks. (Glancing at Rochester) A man should possess only strength and valour. He could be a gentleman or a highwayman. His beauty lies in his power. 
ROCHESTER So a Levantine pirate would do for you? 
BLANCHE (QUIETLY) As long as he resembled you. 
Rochester laughs loudly. Jane is heading for the door. 
BLANCHE (CONT'D) I am serious. To my mind, a man is nothing without a spice of the devil in him. 
Jane closes the door on Blanche. She breathes in fresh air, nauseous. Blanche's splendid prelude drifts out. 
Rochester comes into the hall from the other door. Jane instantly bends down and pretends to be tying her shoe. 
ROCHESTER Why did you leave the room? 
JANE I am tired, sir. 
ROCHESTER Why didn't you come and speak to me? I haven't seen you for weeks. It would have been normal and polite to wish me good evening. 
JANE You seemed engaged, sir. 
ROCHESTER What have you been doing while I've been gone?

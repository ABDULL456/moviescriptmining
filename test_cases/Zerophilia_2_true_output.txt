Luca watches her go, distraught, and then RUNS... 
ATOP A GRASSY HILLSIDE 
Luca collapses on the ground, overlooking Polly Wog's. 
Janine and Keenan run up, a few yards behind. They sit nearby, catching their breath, unsure what to say. 
Luca gazes up at the moon. 
LUCA (CONT'D) What's it like? To really make love? 
They all three gaze up at the moon. 
Keenan steals a glance at Janine. 
KEENAN The best part's just lyin' there after. Really close, really far away. 
JANINE Like goin' to the moon, maybe. 
KEENAN Yeah. ...They should open a pizza joint up there. 
Janine glares at him, and Keenan winces. 
LUCA What am I gonna' do? 
KEENAN Maybe being a woman'll turn out okay. Like being an elevated member of the male species. 
JANINE Elevated "member?" 
KEENAN I just mean, maybe he'll learn to like it. 
JANINE (sarcastic, to Keenan) As hard as that is to conceive! 
LUCA Shut up! Both of you! What, you want a written guarantee? You're so damn lucky! You're into him, he's into you. Super-glue! What the hell else do you need to know? 
Janine looks to Keenan with a look of remorse, hopeful... 
KEENAN I think you're the female half of me. 
JANINE I think you're the macho half of me. 
They kiss. 
LUCA And I don't know what half of who the hell I am. 
They look to Luca surprised,... 
then all three bust out LAUGHING. 
JANINE What are you gonna' do? 
LUCA I don't know. I prefer being a guy, but I'm a girl? I'm attracted to Max, but I'm in love with Michelle? It's like I'm s'posed to be both. 
Her own admission surprises her. 
LUCA (CONT'D) Not too practical. But at least now I know. 
She almost laughs, sad, but relieved. 
INT. POLLY WOG'S POOL HALL - LATE NIGHT 
The place is cleared out, save for Polly cleaning up behind the bar and Max, alone, shooting pool. 
POLLY Girl trouble? Boy trouble? 
Max shrugs. 
POLLY (CONT'D) How about we get a game in before dawn? 
Max nods, sets up a new rack.

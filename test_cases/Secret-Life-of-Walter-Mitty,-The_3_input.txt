Cheryl Mellhoff sits down beside Walter. 
WALTER (CONT'D) What is this? 
He hands her the foggy print - it's clear they have an established working friendship. 
WALTER (CONT'D) I think it's either a man with one sideburn. Or a candelabra. Or a Happy Days lunch box. 
CHERYL (can't make it out clearly EITHER) It's... is it two badminton racquets? What's it supposed to be? 
WALTER It's the Quintessence of Life. So I don't think it's two badminton racquets. Sean O'Connell took this just before he took another one we lost. 
CHERYL (like that's significant) You lost a Sean O'Connell? 
WALTER (looking at the out of FOCUS PRINT) ...I'm trying to figure out what this picture is. I think he focused, set his lens then took the missing picture. It's just a better picture of this. What is this? 
CHERYL Maybe Sean has it. 
WALTER The negative? Yeah, I tried to reach him. He's always in Bahrain. Or a shanty town or somewhere - I got one email off. 
Walter shows Cheryl an email exchange from Sean O'Connell - 
It reads - in need of info for neg 12 of neg roll three, box 
Sean's reply - Best picture I've taken. The total F'ing Quintessence of Life. I hope you're as happy with it as I am. 
Walter's reply = Cool, but can't find it. 
Sean's reply - Out of Office. This is an auto reply. Sean O'Connell will be out of the office through the month of November. 
WALTER (CONT'D) No cell phone. He's out on a freelance. I'd really like to find him. 
Walter has taken further photographs from his briefcase 
WALTER (CONT'D) These are pictures from the last roll he sent in. I'm trying to draw a bead on his location by analyzing these. 
CHERYL Have you figured anything out? 
WALTER Not yet. Because my trail is... water. 
Walter starts showing Cheryl the photographs. The first of which is water - just a picture of water, could be an ocean, lake, or pool (puddle). 
WALTER (CONT'D) A Starbucks, which I don't know which one. (flipping to the next one) And a man (or woman's) thumb. 
This is a picture of a thumb. 
WALTER (CONT'D) I've been trying to figure out the gender (of the thumb), as I sat here. How many people in the world? 
CHERYL Six billion. 
WALTER Everyone's got two, too. 
CHERYL Two, too, what? 
WALTER Thumbs. 
CHERYL Yeah. But I think there are more Starbucks, so I don't know if that's what you'd call a hot trail-- 
WALTER Look what Sean gave me. 
Walter has taken the gift wallet out - S.O. to Walter Mitty - thanks for the great work. 
WALTER (CONT'D) Because we covered, you know, so many hotspots together the last 9 years... (a little more quietly) ...boldly 
CHERYL (having some fun with WALTER) You guys covered the hotspots together boldly? 
WALTER As a team. Yeah. By Sean actually going to the hotspots, and by me staying here waiting for the pictures of hotspots to come back so I can boldly transfer them to magazine format. 
Cheryl's laughed. 
CHERYL ...What did you do this weekend? 
WALTER We're moving my mom here. I went and packed her house up. What about you? 
CHERYL My son and I went on a bike ride in Lake Valhalla. Jersey. We brought lunch. Had lunch in an actual field, of grass. We went swimming. My friend Marny lives on the lake. (getting to what's on everyone's minds around THERE) ...This is going to be the last issue. Life's going to be strictly online after this merger. No new photographs. We're just going to be an internet photo storehouse. That's what I'm hearing. They're going to let most of us go. 
Walter sits there for awhile. That's tough news. He's got a lot on his mind. Then he gets a text: From Odessa, it reads: 
- piano a-holes want 300 more dollars to take the piano back, come down. I have to go. Like right now.

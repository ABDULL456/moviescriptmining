KATE (not picking up the hint) I like drinking is the thing. I mean, I don't want to say you guys are wrong or anything... 
Kate nervously LAUGHS. 
Some of the PEOPLE in the crowd look embarrassed for Kate. 
TATTOO MAN Thank you -- we're all here to help. We do have to move on, though. 
The woman next to Kate gets her to sit back down. 
LILY                                      * Don't worry, sweetie -- there'll be plenty of time to tell your story. 
A young woman -- AMBER, 22 -- approaches the podium. 
AMBER Hey, I'm Amber, alcoholic. I can't really believe that it's been five years. I mean, my life was a mess back then. Now I'm back in school, I have an amazing man, I love my parents -- it's crazy... 
KATE (way too loud) How old is that girl?! Can she even go to bars? (to Amber) How old are you, Amber? 
SHANA                                      * Be respectful. 
Kate seems surprised at being chastised. 
AMBER (gaining intensity) Um...okay? It's because I did the work. I got down on my knees and prayed every night! I went to a meeting everyday! 
KATE Everyday? 
AMBER It wasn't easy, but I've gotta say, I owe everything to AA. Well, AA -- and God, of course! 
The whole room APPLAUDS. 
LATER 
Everyone is standing, holding hands, and saying the SERENITY PRAYER. 
EVERYONE God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change -- courage to change the things I can - - and wisdom to know the difference. 
KATE AMEN! 
Everyone turns and looks at Kate. 
KATE (CONT'D) (embarrassed) Okay...I think I'm good. 
Kate quickly leaves the meeting as clumsily as she arrived. 
22   EXT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT               22 
Kate chugs frozen Margarita straight from a PITCHER. 
KATE So much for that. 
Kate and Charlie stand in their backyard, which is criss- crossed by WHITE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS and has some old LAWN FURNITURE. 
They drunkenly play CROQUET.                                      * 
CHARLIE Was it a bunch of old biker guys? 
KATE No, it was...I don't know. Enthusiastic people. A lot of really ENTHUSIASTIC PEOPLE! 
CHARLIE Yuck -- I hate enthusiasm. I'm sorry it wasn't cool. 
Charlie thinks for a moment. 
CHARLIE (CONT'D) I can't really imagine never drinking. I guess I don't have to, though -- (beat) -- you're the one with the problem. 
Kate nods in agreement.                                           * 
CHARLIE (CONT'D) Hey -- I love you. I don't want you to have to drink. 
KATE I don't have to drink. (beat) I just really like to drink.                            * 
CHARLIE (sincere) Good -- `cause you're my favorite person to drink with in the whole damn world. 
Charlie leans in to kiss Kate. They make out for a moment, and then Kate... 
...BITES Charlie's lip. Charlie pulls back, shocked. Kate grins mischievously.

MADAME WEBER Do you know who I am? (pointing to Constanze) This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests! 
FLUNKY I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders. 
MADAME WEBER Call Herr Mozart! You call Herr Mozart immediately! This is insupportable! 
CONSTANZE Mother, please! 
MADAME WEBER Go ahead, Constanze. Just ignore this fellow. (pushing her) Go ahead, dear! 
FLUNKY (barring the way) I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass. 
MADAME WEBER Young man, I am no stranger to theatres. I'm no stranger to insolence! 
CUT BACK TO: 
INT. OPERA HOUSE STAGE -  VIENNA - NIGHT - 1780'S 
All are applauding Cavalieri. The Emperor turns to Mozart. 
JOSEPH Well, Herr Mozart! A good effort. Decidedly that. An excellent effort! You've shown us something quite new today. 
Mozart bows frantically: he is over-excited. 
MOZART It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire? 
JOSEPH Yes, indeed. 
MOZART And German? 
JOSEPH Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably! 
MOZART So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty? 
JOSEPH Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate. 
MOZART What do you mean, Sire? 
JOSEPH Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say? (he stops in difficulty; to Orsini- Rosenberg) How shall one say, Director? 
ORSINI-ROSENBERG Too many notes, Your Majesty? 
JOSEPH Exactly. Very well put. Too many notes. 
MOZART I don't understand. There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required. Neither more nor less. 
JOSEPH My dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening. I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I, Court Composer? 
SALIERI Yes! yes! er, on  the whole, yes, Majesty. 
MOZART (to Salieri) But this is absurd! 
JOSEPH My dear, young man, don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. And there are simply too many notes, that's all. Cut a few and it will be perfect. 
MOZART Which few did you have in mind, Majesty? 
Pause. General embarrassment. 
JOSEPH Well. There it is. 
Into this uncomfortable scene bursts a sudden eruption of noise and Madame Weber floods onto the stage, followed by her daughters. All turn to look at this amazing spectacle. 
MADAME WEBER Wolfi! Wolfi, my dear! 
She moves toward Mozart with arms outstretched in an absurd theatrical gesture, then sees the Emperor. She stares at him, mesmerized, her mouth open, unable even to curtsey. 
MADAME WEBER Oh! 
Mozart moves forward quickly. 
MOZART Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady. 
JOSEPH Enchanted, Madame. 
MADAME WEBER Oh, Sire! such an honour! And, and, and these are my dear daughters. This is Constanze. She is the fiancee of Herr Mozart. 
Constanze curtsies. CU, of Cavalieri, astonished at the news. CU, of Salieri, watching her receive it. 
JOSEPH Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry? 
MOZART Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent, Your Majesty. Not entirely. Not altogether. 
He giggles uncomfortably. 
JOSEPH Excuse me, but how old are you? 
MOZART Twenty-six. 
JOSEPH Well, my advice is to marry this charming young lady and stay with us in Vienna. 
MADAME WEBER You see? You see? I've told him that, Your Majesty, but he won't listen to me. 
Cavalieri is glaring at Mozart. Mozart looks hastily away from her. 
MADAME WEBER Oh, Your Majesty, you give such wonderful - such impeccable - such royal advice. I - I - May I? 
She attempts to kiss the royal hand, but faints instead. The Emperor contemplates her prone body and steps back a pace. 
JOSEPH Well. There it is. Strack. 
He nods pleasantly to all and leaves the stage, with his Chamberlain. All bow. 
Cavalieri turns with a savage look at Mozart and leaves the stage the opposite way, to her dressing room, tossing her plumed head. Salieri watches. Mozart stays for a second, indecisive whether to follow the soprano or help Madame Weber. 
CONSTANZE (to Mozart) Get some water! 
He hurries away. The daughters gather around Madame Weber. 
INT. CAVALIERI'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT - 1780'S 
Katherina sits fuming at her mirror. A dresser is taking the pins out of her wig as she stares straight ahead of her. Mozart sticks his head round the door.

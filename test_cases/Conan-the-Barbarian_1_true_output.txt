She's reached the base of the chain supporting one of the baskets when she spots the two Jailers closing in, climbing towards her from either side. 
CONAN 
Spotting Tamara overhead, Conan tries to keep beneath her, evading the swarming tentacles while balancing on the rickety planks. 
TAMARA 
She's scaling down the basket supporting chain when the first Jailer reaches out to grab her. She reacts by GASHING his eyes, and as he instinctively grabs them, he FALLS TOWARDS THE PIT. 
CONAN 
Conan barely dives out of the way as the fallen Jailer SMASHES through the plank he was on, forcing Conan to jump to another. 
Just then another COMBATANT comes swinging for the Cimmerian, forcing him to defend while still not balanced. 
TAMARA 
The next Jailer grabs her, pulling her off the cage. He struggles to pull towards a nearby exit hatch when she BITES HIS EAR OFF. 
The Jailer drops Tamara, who SCREAMS as she falls. 
CONAN 
Conan spots Tamara plunging towards him. In one swift move, he SLASHES his opponent, ducks underneath a writhing tentacle, and reaches out to GRAB TAMARA BY THE ARM AS SHE FALLS. His shoulder nearly pops out, but he manages to hold onto Tamara. 
TAMARA 
She swings above the chasm, the gnashing teeth of the monster below her. Only a single splintering plank holds her and Conan aloft. 
CONAN 
With a grunt, he swings Tamara and throws her to safety, at the edge of the pit. 
But as he gets to his feet, he spots the massive Akhun entering the arena. 
AKHUN 
The giant warrior grins as he boards the same plank as Conan. He thrusts his thunderous legs down, causing the plank to bend and warp. 
Conan struggle to balance on the undulating plank, but his training in Cimmeria serves him well. 
Akhun smiles and step closer, again thrusting down with his legs. Conan's balance is thrown, but there's no other plank close enough for him to jump to. 
AKHUN (CONT'D) You'll make a nice meal. 
Akhun steps down on the plank one last time, but this time Conan uses the momentum to SPRINGBOARD UP INTO AIR. 
Conan soars into the air, his cat-like reflexes keeping him focused as he lands right before the stunned Akhun. With one great slash of his blade, Conan eviscerates Akhun. 
Akhun's innards drop out of his belly as he falls into the abyss, only to be snapped up by the massive beast. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ARENA OF THE PIT - LATER 
Conan lowers down the last of the baskets. Tamara use a sword to smash open the lock, freeing the prisoners inside. 
Tamara shares hugs of joy with the other monks of her flock. The women look worn, but unbroken. 
TAMARA Where is Ilira? 
FEMALE MONK She was taken away by Fariq. 
TAMARA Then I'm too late. 
One of the stronger looking women, an ELDER MONK, steps forward. 
ELDER MONK No. She was just taken this morning. It's not yet midnight, and Khalar still must bring her to the cave of Acheron. 
Tamara nods and the women begin to ARM THEMSELVES. Conan shakes his head at the rag-tag group. 
CONAN You're going to fight Khalar's troops? Just you? 
The Elder Monk grabs and nearby pike and twirls it expertly about her body, clearly well versed in it use. 
TAMARA Cimmerians aren't the only women who know how to fight. And to kill.

{"train": "IT \nWritten by \nChase Palmer & Cary Fukunaga \nBased on the novel by \nStephen King \nSTUDIO DRAFT 3-18-2014 \nOPEN ON: \nRain. Lashing a windowpane. A PIANO PLAYS somewhere off screen. Beethoven's Fur Elise. \nINT. WILL'S BEDROOM - DAY \nA little boy gazes out into the storm. Nervous, eager, sweet. Meet GEORGE DENBROUGH (9). \nGEORGE You sure it's not too bad out there? \nWill (13), his older brother,   sits up in bed propped against a pile of pillows, surrounded   by tissues and sheets of newspaper. HEADLINES and TOYS   tell us this is the late 80's -- October, 1987 to be exact. He   puts finishing touches on \nA PAPER BOAT \nWILL Don't be such a wuss. I'd come if I weren't dying. Now get the paraffin. \nGEORGE In the cellar? \nWILL You want it to float or not, Georgie? Go on. Storm's not gonna last forever. \nGEORGE Okay, Willy. \nGeorge jumps up obediently and goes. \nCUT TO: \nTITLE CARD: \nOCTOBER 1987 \nINT. WILL'S HOUSE - DAY \nGeorge hurries downstairs. He catches a glimpse of their mother, SHARON DENBROUGH (30s) in the parlor playing piano, an earthy beauty transported to another world while she plays. \nINT. KITCHEN - WILL'S HOUSE - DAY \nGeorge's stomach sinks as he comes face to face with THE CELLAR DOOR -- the only thing between George and the monster in the basement of his imagination -- IT. \nINT. WILL'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nA WALKIE-TALKIE SQUAWKS next to Will. The sarcastic walkie- talkie filtered voice of RICHIE \"TRASHMOUTH\" TOZIER (12), his neighbor, filters through the plastic speaker. \nRICHIE (WALKIE-TALKIE FILTERED) Willy-boy. \nWill, annoyed, picks up the walkie-talkie.   While looking through his rain blasted window. \nWILL Trashmouth. \nThey wave at each other. Richie, bug-eyed glasses, turns the wave into a middle-finger. \nRICHIE (O.S.) Thought you were sick. \nWILL I am. \nRICHIE (O.S.) Is it mortal? \nINT. CELLAR DOORWAY - CONTINUOUS \nFlinging it open, George ventures his arm into the DARK VOID. He gropes around and finds the LIGHT SWITCH. Nothing. George snatches his arm back. \nGEORGE Oh, balls. The power. \nThe dark basement glares back at him, taunting. \nHERE WE DO SOME SORT OF CALL FROM WILL UPSTAIRS THAT IS A \"CODE\" THEY DO WITH EACH OTHER. THIS WILL COME BACK TO HAUNT US LATER. \nINT. WILL'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nGEORGIE RESPONDS WITH HIS OWN CALL FROM DOWNSTAIRS \nRICHIE (O.S.) What was that? \nWill coughs hard into a tissue. Half-impatient, half-joking: \nWILL Nothing. Georgie and I are making a paper boat. Got to go- \nRICHIE Wait-! \nWill turns off the walkie-talkie. \nINT. KITCHEN - WILL'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nGeorge rubs the gooseflesh on his arms. \nGEORGE (TO HIMSELF) I'm getting it. I'm going to get it. I'm going in. I'm... \nHe steels himself and plunges into the void. \nINT. CELLAR - WILL'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nGeorge scrambles down four steps to THE CELLAR SHELF and sifts through junk as fast as he can: SHOE-POLISH, RAGS, a dusty bag of colored BALLOONS, a broken FLASHLIGHT, two mostly empty bottles of WINDEX, and an old can of TURTLE WAX. \nGrowing accustomed to his parent's lack of communication, he sifts through a PILE OF UNOPENED MAIL on the dining table and finds his report card. Opens it. All A's. \nWILL (CONT'D) I got my report card. \nHe holds the paper limply in his hands. She doesn't acknowledge him and instead gets up and slides the doors shut to the piano room. \nINT. EDDIE KASPBRAK'S HOUSE - DAY \nEddie, Richie, Will, and Stan scramble in the front door like feral animals. An enormous 300-pound woman sits in the living room doing a puzzle on her own stomach. SONIA KASPBRAK (40s). \nEDDIE Hi Mom. \nWILL Mrs. Kaspbrak. \nRICHIE Ma'am. \nINT. EDDIE'S KITCHEN - DAY \nThey raid the kitchen, stuffing Capri Suns, Ding Dongs, whatever snacks they can find into their backpacks. Mrs. Kaspbrak calls from the room. \nMRS. KASPBRAK Eddie-bear, where are you boys off to? \nRICHIE Eddie-bear? \nWill elbows him. \nWILL Just my backyard, Mrs. K. We got a new, uh, badminton set. \nMRS. KASPBRAK Okay. Just don't go rolling around too much on that grass, sweetie. Especially if it's just been cut. You know how your allergies get. \nEDDIE Yes, ma. \nMRS. KASPBRAK Isn't he cute, boys? So cute. \nShe wiggles her fat toes at him. He's mortified. \nWILL Cutest boy we know, Mrs. Kaspbrak. \nRICHIE The Miss America of cute boys. Seriously. \nEDDIE Bye ma. \nFast as they came the boys blow out the front door. \nEXT. STREET IN FRONT OF LIBRARY - DAY \nWill, Rich, and Eddie speed past the library. \nINT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY \nAll green globes, curving iron staircases, and shadowy charm. A librarian, MRS. STARRET (50s) places a stack of books in front of Ben. \nMRS. STARRET Isn't it summer vacation? I would think you'd be ready to take a break from the books. \nBEN I like it in here. It's-- \nHe glances at a newspaper behind her: \"BODY FOUND NEAR CANAL NOT THAT OF COEN YOUTH, BORTON ANNOUNCES.\" Safe. \nBEN (CONT'D) Inspiring. \nMrs. Starret smiles sweetly at this large boy. \nMRS. STARRET Well, even with all this terrible disappearing of kids business, a boy should be with his friends, outside, having fun. \nShe starts stamping his books.      CHUCHUNP. \nBEN (EMBARRASSED) I'll try, Mrs. Starret. \nCHUCHUNP.   CHUCHUMP. \nMRS. STARRET What are all these for anyway? \nCHUCHUMP. \nBEN I'm reading about the history of this place. You know how many spooky things have-- \nONE-ARMED OLD MAN Excuse me, miss? \nA ONE-ARMED OLD MAN comes up behind them wearing a U.S.S. Indianapolis cap. \nONE-ARMED OLD MAN (CONT'D) Where's the children's section? \nCHUCHUMP.   Mrs. Starret slides Ben his stack of books. \nINT. BEVERLY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY \nBeverly opens her fridge. There's nothing in it but a plastic jug of margarine, some half-molded white bread, and suspect milk. She sniffs the milk. \nINT. BEVERLY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nBeverly sips the milk, leaving a wholesome white mustache on her upper lip. She looks up to see... \nHer Mother, MRS. MARSH (30s), a former prom queen long since faded, watching her. Studying her. \nMRS. MARSH Bev. \nBEVERLY Yeah, Mommy? \nMrs. Marsh sounds like she might be on sedatives. \nMRS. MARSH You had your monthly, yet? \nBEVERLY What Mommy? \nINT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY \nBen sits at a table of six by himself, flipping through books on DERRY'S HISTORY. \nINDIANS, COLONIZATION, DISAPPEARING SETTLEMENTS, LOGGING, MURDERS, MASSACRES, it gets more and more violent. Glancing up, he sees... \nThe one-armed old man plunk a NICKEL into a jar and take a STAMPED POST CARD from a tray by the door. A poster there READS: \nLIBRARIES ARE FOR WRITING TOO. WHY NOT WRITE A FRIEND TODAY? \nEXT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - LATER \nBen sits on the steps, POSTCARD in his lap. He clicks a pen open and, brow furled in concentration, dashes off a HAIKU. \nBEN (whispering it outloud) Your hair is winter fire, JANUARY EMBERS My heart burns there, too. \nEXT. CANAL STREET - LATER \nBen is about to the drop the postcard into a MAILBOX when has second thoughts. He holds it just over the slot. We see that it's addressed to: MISS BEVERLY MARSH, LOWER MAIN STREET, DERRY MAINE, ZONE 2. Ben closes his eyes, steels his courage \nAND LETS GO. \nTRAVIS (O.C.) Hello hot tits. \nTravis, Snatch, Hockstettler, and Victor prowl toward him. Ben bolts, ass swinging back and forth like a girl. Travis and his gang take off after him... \nEXT. KANSAS STREET - CONTINUOUS \nIt's no contest. Ben rounds the corner and just makes THE KISSING BRIDGE, a historic covered wooden bridge carved with thousands of hearts crossing right where the canal turns into the wild, untamed barrens, KENDUSKAEG STREAM rushing below. \nTRAVIS Gotcha! \nThey snag Ben and fling him against the railing. Travis flips up his sweatshirt, exposing his fat belly, and slaps it hard. Ben screams like a rabbit, whipsawing back and forth. \nSNATCH Look at that gut! \nVICTOR Sounds like a pig. Don't he sound just like a pig? \nVictor SQUEALS like a pig in Ben's face. \nBEN You better quit, I swear. \nTravis pulls a BUCK KNIFE from his jeans. Ben's eyes go wide. \nTRAVIS Or what? You'll go crying to mama? I'll give you something to cry about. \nBen looks around for help. A CAR comes slowly down the street. Travis hides the knife, pressing its steel against Ben's white belly. \nTRAVIS (CONT'D) Go ahead. Yell. You'll be picking your fucking intestines off your sneakers. \nThe OLD COUPLE behind the wheel CATCH EYES WITH BEN, see his tears, and STEP ON THE ACCELERATOR. Ben sees A CLOWN riding in the back seat, grinning -- PENNYWISE. \nTRAVIS (CONT'D) Okay, tits. It's exam time. First question: when I say `Let me copy' during finals what do you say? \nBEN Yes! I say yes! Okay! Copy all you want! \nTRAVIS That's good. Now how can we make sure that sticks? \nBEN I DON'T-- \nIn two quick motions Travis SLASHES A BRIGHT RED \"T\" in Ben's belly. \nSnatch and Victor laugh.    Hockstettler pulls out his lighter and a can of hairspray. \nHOCKSTETTLER Let me light his head on fire like Michael Jackson. \nHockstettler jettisons a fireball with his make-shift flame thrower, just past Ben's head. \nTRAVIS No! Hold him. I'm gonna carve my entire name on his cottage cheese filled ass. \nBen is too shocked to scream. He looks over his shoulder at the stream behind him, then back at Travis's bloody blade. \nTRAVIS (CONT'D) Now say it with me. What comes after T? \nBen plants his heel in Travis's chest and launches himself backward over the railing, out of the grip of Victor and Snatch. Travis is knocked back on his ass onto the pavement. \nEXT. KENDUSKAEG STREAM - CONTINUOUS \nBen tumbles down the culvert, fetching up hard against a fallen tree. He picks himself up, eye to eye with \nA HUB CAP \nTRAVIS Oh, you're dead, tits. \nTravis comes leaping over the railing with the knife, Victor and Snatch right behind. Ben grabs the hub cap and HURLS IT \nPELTING Travis IN THE FACE \nTravis trips up, taking down Victor and Snatch with him. They all splash down in the stream, where Travis LOSES THE KNIFE. \nBen darts off across the water into a thicket of woods. \nTHE BARRENS \nTravis gropes around for his lost knife, suddenly hysterical. \nTRAVIS (CONT'D) My knife, Goddamn it! I lost my daddy's knife! \nVictor and Snatch help Travis search the stream, their hands passing right by where the BLADE IS WEDGED UNDER A LOG. \nEXT. THE BARRENS - DAY \nAnother boy's hand fishes around under water and grasps upon something. ON Will as he PULLS OUT A SNEAKER. Behind him... \nRICHIE Heads up, homeschool! \nMIKE Eat me, townie! \nEXT. KISSING BRIDGE - DAY \nTravis, Snatch, Victor, and Hockstettler are still looking for the knife in the water under the bridge. \nSNATCH It probably got washed away, Travis. \nTravis grabs Victor by his collar and growls in his face. \nTRAVIS It ain't been washed away.     It's been stolen. \nVICTOR Stolen, by who? \nTravis points up the embankment at Mike, biking home over the bridge. \nTRAVIS That nigger right there. \nEXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY \nMike bikes home, sucking on the lollypop, when he notices something coming up fast behind him. \nTRAVIS and his boys in a beat up Trans Am. \nHe starts peddling faster. Sees the KITCHENER IRONWORKS sign ahead and skids right down its path towards the ghostly titanic ruin. \nEXT. FIELD - KITCHENER IRONWORKS - DAY \nMike looks around for a place to hide, a bird spooking off from the twisted carcass of the factory building. The Penobscot River flows behind. \nTravis and his boys skid to a stop in the field, machinery blocks their pursuit by car so they jump out on foot. \nMike finds a SMOKESTACK laying in shattered sections in the grass. He stares into its big black bore, picks up a loose tile, and pitches it in. It lands with a faint echo in the darkness. \nINT. KITCHENER IRONWORKS - MOMENTS LATER \nTravis, Snatch, Victor and Hockstettler search for Mike in the SKELETAL REMAINS of the old ironworks structure itself, an open wound of twisted iron beams. \nOblivious to any danger other than their own volatile potential, we get a sense that around every corner, some ominous figure is just ducking out of sight. \nMike clocks them from inside the smokestack, the dodges around the perimeter of the ironworks structure. \nHe nears the CELLAR HOLD, a yawning chasm on the edge of the ruins. Sees a Derry Historical Society PLAQUE: \nON THESE PREMISES AN EXPLOSION TOOK THE LIVES OF 102 SOULS (88 CHILDREN) EASTER SUNDAY, 1906. MAY THEY REST IN PEACE \nPENNYWISE appears across the cellar hold OVER HIS SHOULDER. When Mike looks up from reading Pennywise IS GONE. \nMike looks back across the weedy field to THE FENCE, his bike still leaned against it. It seems a million miles off. \nEXT. KITCHENER IRONWORKS \nTravis and the boys continue to explore the far side of the factory, sensing Mike may have made a run for the river. \nINT./EXT. KITCHENER IRONWORKS \nSensing an opportunity, Mike books it back to his bike. \nINT. KITCHENER IRONWORKS \nHockstettler notices something off screen.    Walks towards it. \nFollowing Hockstettler we see what he sees: a lone BALLOON, as if just leaving the grasp of a child, floating up in the air. \nHOCKSTETTLER What the fuh... \nHe looks back at Travis and the others, who are sniffing out the weeds near the river. \nEXT. KITCHENER IRONWORKS \nMike gets to his bike and starts pushing it up the hill. He looks back towards the factory. Travis and his boys still haven't come back to their car. Mike pedals home. \nINT. KITCHENER IRONWORKS \nTravis, angry they didn't find Mike huffs back across the field, throwing a piece of scrap pipe he found against a giant corrugated wall. The entire factory vibrates with the gonging sound. \nTRAVIS Let's go! That jungle monkey ain't here no more. \nTravis walks obliviously past AN EASTER EGG, smeared with bloody fingerprints, but Hockstettler sees it, picks it up. \nHOCKSTETTLER I'm staying. \nThe three of them turn towards Hockstettler like he's insane. \nTRAVIS Why? \nHOCKSTETTLER I don't know. (LAUGHING) I want to see its insides. \nHe points towards the door leading to the dark innards of the factory. \nHOCKSTETTLER (CONT'D) You guys want to come? \nTRAVIS (DISGUSTED) Why the- Hell no. You mental? This place gives me the creeps. \nEXT. KITCHENER IRONWORKS \nTravis and the others load up and peel off in their car. \nHockstettler watches them leave, a cloud of dust in their place, then turns towards the darkest parts of the factory, as if pulled deeper into the core unconsciously. \nANGLE OVER CELLAR HOLD, Hockstettler peers in.   He grabs a handhold and sways over its cavernous depth. \nWILL Oh no. Eddie! Eddie! \nBEVERLY I knew I shouldn't `a given him that granola. Mr. Keene! \nMR. KEENE You guys know the drill, don't you? \nWill fishes the EPI-PEN from the fanny pack. \nWILL I'm a pacifist. \nBEVERLY My mom doesn't like me handling needles. \nAnnoyed, Keene comes out from behind the counter. He kneels next to Eddie and takes the pen, plunging it into his thigh. Will screens Beverly as she SHOPLIFTS THE SUPPLIES and SLIPS OUT THE STORE. Eddie opens his eyes, breathing normal. \nEDDIE Thanks, Mr. Keene.   That one was a real shit kicker. \nEXT. KEENE'S PHARMACY - DAY \nWill and Eddie race out laughing. Bev is waiting on the curb to meet them. She flips Will the stolen goods. \nBEVERLY Not bad for a bunch of amateurs. \nShe flashes a pack of STOLEN CIGARETTES and struts off towards her house. THEY LOVE THIS GIRL. Will closes Eddie's mouth and they hustle round the corner into RICHARD'S ALLEY. \nWILL We got it! \nHe flips Ben his medicine. Stan runs up from behind, still looking blanched from his synogogue experience. \nEDDIE Shit Stan, what happened to you? You look like you've seen a ghost. \nSTAN Nothing. \nHe sees Ben there, looking like a train wreck. \nSTAN (CONT'D) What happened to him? \nINT. POLICE STATION - DAY \nANGLE ON A CLOSE-UP of the \"Coen shoe\" placed on a desk in front of CHIEF BORTON and OFFICER BOWERS, Travis' hillbilly father. Will is alone in the room with them while-- \nINT. POLICE STATION - MAIN BULL PEN - SAME \nBen, all bandaged up, looks on with Eddie, Richie, and Stan as Will speaks to the police officers. \nBEN Beverly was there? \nEDDIE Yeah. \nBEN And she stole this stuff for me? \nStanley wants Ben to shut up, but Ben is beyond excited. \nBEN (CONT'D) Did she know it was for me? \nRICHIE I don't think she even knows you're alive man. \nBEN                          STAN Yes she does.                   What's going on in there? \nRICHIE (CONT'D) What do you think? He's handing `em the kid's shoe. It's riveting. \nBen checks his Timex, cracked but working. \nRICHIE (CONT'D) Takes a lickin' and keeps on tickin', huh? \nBEN My mom gave it to me so I wouldn't be late for curfew. \nEDDIE I think he means you, Big Ben. \nThe boys shove him playfully.   Ben shoves back. \nBEN It's funny, `til the last week I didn't think anyone knew my name. \nRICHIE You're pretty friggin' hard to miss. \nEDDIE Guys, you think whoever kidnapped Dorsey might of, I dunno... got Georgie too? \nRICHIE                            BEN If he creeps in storm drains,    Who's Georgie? maybe. \nEDDIE (CONT'D) Will's little brother. Or was. Before your time. \nRICHIE Will won't talk about it but the kid's arm got ripped clean off in a flash flood or something. \nRichie turns towards Stan, who's been unnaturally quiet this whole time. \nRICHIE (CONT'D) Cat got your tongue? \nSTAN What? \nRICHIE                           EDDIE Why are you so quiet?            What's Chief Borton going to do with a shoe? \nSTAN                            BEN I'm not.   I'm listening.        A storm drain. Crazy. \nWill steps out. \nRICHIE Well? \nEDDIE What did he say? \nWILL Nothing. Thanked me for being a good young citizen. \nRICHIE So let's get outta here. Police stations always make me feel guilty of something. \nEXT. OLD CAPE STREET - DAY \nBEVERLY GASPS and drops the measurer. It goes clattering into the sink, the tape coiling up like a snake, blood flickering everywhere as she stumbles back, tripping into the shower. \nBLOOD GOUTS UP FROM THE SINK DRAIN \nLike a demonic ejaculation -- blood splatters the mirror, the wallpaper, bouncing off walls and covering Beverly. She SCREAMS and runs out the door... \nINT. BEVERLY'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \n...into her father, who comes charging up the hall. She screams again, recoiling away. \nMR. MARSH What the devil's gotten into you, girl? \nBEVERLY The bathroom! Daddy, in the BATHROOM-- \nHis arm shoots out and GRABS HER WRIST LIKE A VICE. \nMR. MARSH Someone peeking at you, Bevvie? Huh? \nBEVERLY No... the sink... in the sink... \nHe stalks past, dragging her behind him. They step into... \nINT. BEVERLY'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - NIGHT \nMr. Marsh looks around, eyes wide, blood splattered everywhere, but the blood doesn't register with him. \nHe shoves her against the wall. Hard. \nMR. MARSH You know I hate gettin' rough with you. I never do when you don't deserve it. \nHe points back to the gory sink. \nMR. MARSH (CONT'D) What's my tape measurer doin' outta my toolbelt? \nHe steps over and grabs the BLOOD-COATED TAPE, clipping it onto his belt, blood on his hands now too. He doesn't seem to see any of it. Only Beverly can. She realizes this. \nMR. MARSH (CONT'D) Answer me girl. \nHe raises his hand. \nBEVERLY The sink... I was... I thought I saw a spider... \nUncertain whether he'll hit her anyway, she closes her eyes and prepares for a smacking. \nMR. MARSH (SMILING) A spider? \nBEVERLY Yes, sir. I'm sorry for waking you. \nHe lowers his hand, gentle now, proprietary. \nMR. MARSH I worry about you, Bevvie. I worry a lot. \nSmoothing out her hair over her forehead. The blood on her face like finger paint. This is when he scares her the most. \nMR. MARSH (CONT'D) You know why I don't drink or smoke or chase after women like other fathers do? \nBEVERLY Because you love momma? \nMR. MARSH Not just her, Bevvie. You. You're almost a woman now, too. And I got me all I need right here at home. \nHe rests his forehead against hers, breathes in her scent, goes back down the hall to his game. \nINT. DETAIL ON CEILING - NIGHT \nANGLE ON a wet, dark spot as it grows on a white plaster ceiling, the first droplet of water forming. SLOW MOTION as it breaks away and falls through space... \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. WILL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \n...onto Will's head. He doesn't stir. But then it is followed by SEVERAL OTHERS. Finally, he awakes. Looks up. \nA leak in the ceiling. \nWill flips back his covers. \nINT. BATHROOM HALLWAY - NIGHT \nWill grabs a bucket from a utility closet and, walking back, sees Georgie's room's door open... \nINT. GEORGE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nWill enters, the room frozen in time. GEORGIE'S TOY BOX is open. Photographs and posters line the walls. \nSTAR WARS bedsheets crisp and military tight on the bed.    A Lego Turtle on the night stand. Will picks it up. \nWill sits down, Turtle in hand, and indulges in the sadness that has engulfed his home for months. The loss of his brother hitting him full force, he closes his eyes to fight back the tears, but cannot. \nHe cries for George. Photographs of George, illuminated by passing cars, seem to watch him from the walls. \nA SHADOW seems to stretch across Georgie's room from the doorway. \nWill looks up but no one is there. \nINT. CORRIDOR - WILL'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nWill steps out of George's room and finds DARK FOOTPRINTS IN THE CARPET. He leans down and touches one -- squishy and wet. They track down the dark staircase. \nWill, heart pounding, follows the wet footprints down the stairs, careful not to step in any of them. \nWILL Hello?   Dad? \nINT. DOWNSTAIRS - WILL'S HOUSE - DAY \nWill sits up and looks out at the water. It is so black it seems other worldly. Not breaking his stare from the water, he addresses the group. \nWILL Do you guys ever feel there's something wrong with Derry. Like it's, I don't know, haunted or something? \nEDDIE Haunted how? \nWILL I keep thinking about Ben's walls. \nBen, happy to have something else to focus on other than Beverly, looks at Will. \nBEN You mean how all sorts of disasters and disappearances and stuff keeps on happening here? \nWILL Yeah.   It's strange. \nStan opens his eyes and joins in. \nSTAN Like any town, right? That's been around long enough, bad stuff is bound to happen. I mean, have you read the Torah? \nRichie, turns over to work on his back. \nRICHIE Boys, you're ruining my sunbathing vibes with all this chitter chatter. \nBeverly, eyes still closed, places a cigarette in her mouth and lights up. Ben notices her hands shake as she holds the cigarette in her mouth. The smoke swirls and dissipates over them. \nBEVERLY Have you been seeing \"things\" Will? \nWill whips his neck to Beverly. He can't tell if she is making fun or if she is seriously asking him for a bridge. \nWILL I... If I tell you guys something you won't think I'm crazy. \nRICHIE We already know you're crazy, Will. No judgement here. \nWILL I saw Georgie last night.   Only. It wasn't him. \nEDDIE Like.   In your dreams? \nWILL No. In my house, he tried to get me to go into the basement with him. \nRICHIE That wasn't Georgie, that was your neighborhood sex offender making a house call. \nWILL Shut up Richie. It wasn't just him. I saw this other... I don't know. \nSTAN What did you see Will? \nBEN The clown? \nWill, Stan and Eddie look at Ben. \nWILL Yes. That's what it was, a scary looking clown. And it had these teeth... \nSTAN I saw something, too. In the basement of the synogogue. \nRICHIE I take it back. I'm judging all of you and you are all friggin' wackos. \nBeverly, still laying there, exhales a long trail of smoke. \nBEVERLY I need to show you guys something. \nEXT. LOWER MAIN STREET - DAY \nThe FIVE boys and Beverly stand outside her slummy apartment building. She looks frightened to go inside. \nBEVERLY My Daddy will kill me if he finds out I had boys in our apartment. \nBEN Isn't he at work? \nBEVERLY Sometimes he comes home for a nap. \nWILL We should leave lookouts. Ben, Stan, can you? \nBen is ready to protest. Then succumbs, crestfallen. \nSTAN What does he look like? \nBEVERLY My Daddy?    Mean. Like a drunk. \nWill, Richie and Eddie go with Bev. \nINT. BEVERLY'S APARTMENT - DAY \nBev opens the door. It creeks open. The apartment seems to be empty. Afternoon sunlight illuminating floating dust motes. She scouts around and lets them in. \nWill, Richie, and Eddie follow her to a closed door at the end of the hallway -- THE BATHROOM DOOR \nBEVERLY In there. \nRICHIE Can you give me an indicator of what I'm about to walk into? \nBEVERLY You'll see. \nRICHIE I hope it's Ed McMahon and I've just won publishers clearing house 10 million dollar sweepstakes. But if it is, you really didn't have to go through so much trouble, you could have just brought Ed to the quarry. \nShe has no intention of going in. Will pushes past Richie and opens the door. \nEDDIE Oh God. Oh God. \nTHE BLOOD \nStill there, faded into maroon clouds on the mirror and wallpaper. Richie reels back into the hallway with Beverly. \nShe looks from Richie to Will. \nBEVERLY You really see it? \nOFFICER BOWERS (blocking the way) Whoa whoa. Where do you crumb snatchers think you're going? \nWILL We know what's been taking the kids. Chief! \nBorton steps out.    His long day just got worse. \nCHIEF BORTON It's okay, Butch. Someone try to do something to you kids? \nBEN                           BEVERLY Not someone.    Something.        There's like this spirit. \nBEN A clown. \nSTAN Or sometimes it's something else. \nEDDIE Only us kids can see it. \nBorton narrows his eyes at Richie, the only one silent. \nBORTON Okay, stop. Is this you Tozier? Did you put them up to this little practical joke. \nWILL No, we all saw it. \nOFFICER BOWERS Such wild imaginations. Too bad we can't bottle their little brains. Dry them out and grind them into powder to salt our food. Maybe then we'd see, what was it again? \nBorton's exhausted.   He's having none of it. \nCHIEF BORTON You youngsters realize there's a penalty in Derry for filing a false police report. I don't want to have to call your parents, now. \nBEVERLY But we're not lying. \nCHIEF BORTON You have any evidence? \nThe kids all look at each other, stymied. \nCHIEF BORTON (CONT'D) That's what I thought. I don't want to hear another word of this, not here, not a whisper of it anywhere. Now go home, all of you. Eat dinner with your families, sleep and have sweet dreams in your pj's. And tomorrow, you're going to go play like normal kids and forget all about this fantasy about murder and monsters. This is an adult matter. You got it? \nBEN But you adults aren't doing anything! \nOFFICER BOWERS Watch your tone, boy. \nThe kids all stand there, Borton's big frame intimidating. \nCHIEF BORTON I don't see you leaving. \nEXT. POLICE STATION - DAY \nThe kids all step outside, morally deflated. \nWILL I guess we're on our own. \nCUT TO: \nTITLE CARD over the PENOBSCOT RIVER: \nJULY 4th, 1988 EXT. DERRY - AERIAL - SUNSET \nA smoky haze obscures the setting sun and rough hewed mountains. \nEXT. KANSAS STREET - DUSK \nCRRRRRACK! A mailbox explodes as a Trans-Am speeds off, the boys inside it whooping and laughing their heads off. \nThe car swings up to another and Travis Bowers leans out of the window, throwing in a SIZZLING M-80. \nHe shuts the lid, pulls back into the passenger seat, and screams to the driver, Victor. \nTRAVIS Go! Go! Go! \nVictor hits it and they roar off. Snatch and MOOSE SADLER (16) scrunched like sardines in the backseat. They all look back to see... \nCRRRRRACK! The mailbox explodes. The boys share a hip flask bottle of Southern Comfort- \nTRAVIS (CONT'D) God I love the Fourth. \nSNATCH It's my turn. Pass one back. \nTravis fishes the bag full of M-80s and bottle rockets and they blow another mailbox. \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DUSK \nMike enters, sheepish. Leroy is in bed, full of tubes to bleeping machines. He looks decimated. Mike's mom is on her way out. \nMIKE'S MOM You'll be okay? \nMike nods.    She squeezes Mike's shoulder as she goes. \nLEROY Mom tell you what's the what? \nMIKE Doctors say it's inside your bones. And spreading. \nLEROY Your Mom's going to need you to be strong, Mikey. Help keep the abatoir running. \nMike nods. \nMIKE I'll try. \nLEROY You do or you don't do. No try. \nLeroy coughs.    His lungs are filling with fluid. \nMIKE It's my fault. \nLEROY Stop that, Mike. There's no one to blame here. It's nature taking its course. \nINT. HOSPITAL, CORRIDER - NIGHT \nMike steps out into the corridor. The hospital seems eerily dark, empty and quiet. \nA LIGHT STROBES down the long hall. It draws Mike to it, like a moth to a flame. He turns the corner and sees... \nA fire alarm pulled, white greasy fingerprints on the lever. Emergency lights strobe along the walls. No sound of an alarm. No doctors or nurses anywhere. \nSuddenly, at the end of the long corridor, a SHEEP trots out from a door, staccato in the strobing light. It stops, looks at Mike, then trots into another door. \nMike starts after it, baffled. He approaches the door the sheep walked into, a stream of WATER FLOODING OUT ONTO THE FLOOR. \nHe stops, the water rushing past his feet. He looks back behind him, the normally lit hallway now far far away. \nBAAA \nHe hears the sheep just inside the open door. He enters through it without noticing the stencil on the glass of the door: \"DERRY COUNTY CORONER.\" \nINT. HOSPITAL, CORONER'S OFFICE \nMike enters a windowless bunker like room with all the metal corpse lockers, metal autopsy table and a sink in the corner, the emergency lights still strobing. \nThe sheep is nowhere to be found. \nInstead Mike finds, in the middle of the floor under the autopsy table, a DRAIN GURGLING UP WATER, the source of the flooding out into the corridor. \nSLAM! \nThe door slams behind him. Mike runs over to it, jiggles the lock, but it won't open. Behind him, in between flashes of the strobe, PENNYWISE APPEARS THEN DISAPPEARS... \nMike stops dead, sensing It's presence like he did at the old Ironworks. He slowly looks back as... \nONE OF THE CORPSE LOCKER DOORS CREAK OPEN \nMike opens his mouth to scream but nothing comes out. \nHe's pounding on the door. \nMIKE Somebody! HELP! Let me out! (BEAT) Dad! Mom! \nHe looks over his shoulder while continuing to BANG. The tray inside the open locker slowly slides out, like a tongue from a mocking black mouth. On it, under a white sheet, is a CORPSE. \nMike dares look back just as the sheet catches and the corpse is uncovered. It's none other than PATRICK HOCKSTETTLER, whose legs and arms (up to the elbow) have been bit off, smaller, CHILD SIZE bite marks cover his body. \nMike jumps to a corner where he grabs a saw to defend himself. \nWater spews up from the drain with more and more pressure, a pool now covering the floor, the edge of which seeps toward Mike. \nMike climbs up on a chair, afraid of the water, now with a full view of Patrick's mutilated body. \nJUST THEN PATRICK TURNS HIS HEAD AND LOOKS AT MIKE \nPATRICK It's killing your daddy, Mikey. Eating him away. \nMIKE Shut up. \nPATRICK A worm inside a rotten apple. We're all apples, Mikey. All of us. You know the thing about apples -- \nMIKE Stop it. \nPatrick's expression turns into a horrific, fearful murmur. \nPATRICK -- they float. \nMIKE No! \nTHE WALLS START TO SLIDE IN. As if the room were shrinking. The walls shepherding him towards Patrick's talking corpse. \nMike reaches behind him, scraping at the walls, looking for anything with purchase. His hands find the FIRE ALARM. Pulls it. \nThis time the alarm SOUNDS and the strobe lights freeze, the room now fully lit. \nMike looks back, calipers raised, and sees the locker doors closed again, no water on the floor. \nThe door opens behind him. It's the CORONER, Chief Borton, and PATRICK'S PARENTS there to identify the remains of their boy. \nMike is nearly catatonic.   He holds onto the Chief, catching his breath. \nCHIEF BORTON What are you doing here, son? \nSpeechless and terrified Mike races past them out of the hospital. \nEXT. OLD CAPE STREET - NIGHT \nMike walks home, distraught, mindless to the traffic. He is nearly hit by a car as he storms away from the hospital. \nA Trans Am turns a corner behind him.   Headlights on high- beam. It stops. \nMike turns, sees, realizes who it is, runs. \nINT. TRANS AM - SAME \nTravis climbs out of the passenger seat and over to the driver seat. \nTRAVIS Move. \nVictor gets out and runs around the car. \nSNATCH Hey, ain't that the little shit your dad gave you a whoopin' over? \nFurious, Travis slams on the gas pedal.    POV of CAR, giving chase to Mike. \nTRAVIS I'm gonna run him over. \nSTAN How? \nWILL With these. \nWill points to their arsenal of fireworks. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BEN'S NEIGHBORHOOD - MINUTES LATER \nMike runs past families and kids distracted by the fireworks display happening overhead, Bowers gang almost on him in the Trans Am. \nMike cuts between a lawn between two houses, hopping a fence. Bowers hits the gas and fishtails it around the next block to cut Mike off. \nWill and his gang see this and take a short cut of their own. Ben, boy-boobs jiggling, takes up the rear. \nEXT.   NEIBOLT STREET - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT \nMike spills out between lawns on Neibolt street; a dead end. There is a small pier that cuts into the canal with an old abandoned \"lock house\" at the end. \nThe Trans-Am roars into view at the other end of the block. Revs the engine. \nINT. TRANS AM - NIGHT \nTravis is focused on Mike, who is frozen in the street. \nTRAVIS Got the little fucker now. \nAnother boy runs out with him. Will. \nVICTOR Is that that pussy Denbrough? \nTRAVIS This night just gets better and better. \nTravis slams on the gas. \nEXT. NEIBOLT STREET - NIGHT \nTires screeching.   Travis guns it straight for Mike and Will. \nWILL Don't move. \nMIKE You nuts? \nWILL Trust us. We're here to help you take these jerks. \nMIKE We? \nLooking to the side, Will has his walkie-talkie. \nWILL (into the walkie-talkie) Not yet... not yet. Now! \nBetween the Trans-Am and Mike and Will, Ben and Richie heave their shoulders into a large steel DUMPSTER filled with construction material. They push it down a driveway that leads to the street. It creaks, starts to wobble, then move down the incline. When it hits street level, though, the gutter stops it from going out into line of the Trans Am. \nBEN Fuck. \nWill sees this. \nWILL Oh shit. Abort! Abort! \nMIKE Abort? What does that mean. \nWILL Run! \nThey're about to dodge the car when- \nBEVERLY jumps out firing off her 6-BARRELED MORTAR handheld, aimed horizontally, at the car. THUMP. The recoil throws her back while the rocketing projectile explodes in front of the Trans-Am. Travis and the boys shield their faces SCREAMING as the front windshield explodes. \nBEVERLY Woah! \nTHUMP. This one knocks her to the ground as the second mortar flies right towards the Trans Am. Travis yanks the wheel to the LEFT as the firework EXPLODES on the side of the car. He slams on the breaks as Victor, Snatch, and Moose are flung forward. Victor smashes his face on the dash board. \nMIKE Is that girl for real? \nWILL Real as it gets... Now, Stan and Eddie! \nEddie and Stan charge from behind a hedge. Lighting bottle- rockets aimed at the car. Travis and his boys have to duck for cover as ONE of the rockets ZINGS through the car. \nTRAVIS Those little motherfuckers.   Get out, get out! \nThe OLDER BOYS climb out the windows, ducking and covering their eyes from the ONSLAUGHT of bottle rockets and roman candle projectiles. \nCrouched behind the trunk, Travis lights up three M-80's WITH CLOWN FACES on them and tosses them like grenades at Beverly, Stan, and Eddie's positions. \nThe M-80's blow HUGE fist sized holes in the blacktop, bigger than can possibly be legal, exploding gravel peppering the kids, stunning them for a moment. \nSTAN Holy hell. What kinda gear do they got? \nWILL I don't wanna stay and find out. \nBen and Richie race up from behind, letting loose another barrage as they pass Bowers' gang and the Trans Am, giving cover as the FIRE FIGHT, literally, becomes a retreating manoeuver towards the pier at the end of Neibolt street. \nTravis' boys cover their eyes but they make aggressive progress towards the kids with their terrifying M-80's. \nTRAVIS I've been waiting all summer to run into you, Denbrough. \nWILL Leave us alone Bowers. I don't want anyone to get seriously hurt. \nTRAVIS Hurt? When I'm done with you, you'll wish you were in that storm drain with your brother. \nEXT. NEIBOLT STREET PIER - CONTINUOUS \nThey regroup at the mouth of the pier, water on both sides, Bowers in front. He throws another M-80, which tears into a wood plank. Splinters shoot everywhere. \nINT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, BASEMENT \nThe kids can see Travis staring straight at them through the window, the 2x4 is non-existent, as if Pennywise is preventing the boys outside from seeing in or entering. \nSTAN They can't see the window? \nEDDIE (STILL REPEATING) We shouldn't be here. \nRICHIE Don't count your chickens. \nMIKE Something wrong with your friend here? \nEDDIE We shouldn't be here! \nWILL                             RICHIE Eddie?                             He's afraid of dirt. \nWill covers Eddie's mouth as he continues to yell, \"we shouldn't be here.\" They watch anxiously as Travis and the boys feet inch uncomfortably closer to them. \nThen Eddie suddenly stops. \nEXT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE - SAME \nFrustrated, Travis and the boys leave. \nINT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, BASEMENT \nThe kids have surrounded Eddie. \nBEVERLY What is it Eddie? \nEDDIE There's something I didn't tell you guys. \nWILL What? \nEDDIE This house. I saw something here once. I thought it was just my mind playing tricks, but now I know... \nThey sense what he is about to say isn't going to be good. \nEDDIE (CONT'D) I saw \"IT.\" \nEddie nods. \nSTAN Jesus. \nRICHIE (TO STAN) Why do you keep using our teams, guy? \nSTAN Wha? \nMIKE What does he mean by \"IT?\" \nWill looks to the gang, they all nod.     He turns back to their newest member. \nWILL Something's wrong with Derry. Haunting it. Hunting and killing kids. We've all seen it. \nMike looks at them all, judging their earnestness. Feels he can trust them, an instant connection with people whose fear clings to your own. \nMIKE I know.   I've seen \"IT\" too. \nJust then, the house seems to shiver. As if its foundation had shifted. A CLANKING SOUND resonates from the pipes. Water BEGINS TO SEEP in through the cracks in the basement. \nBEVERLY What exactly did you see here, Eddie? \nBen goes to the window they came through, but instead of seeing out, it's now covered by the 2x4. \nBEN Guys, uh-- \nHe looks at their feet. They all do. Water coming in fast. Ben bangs a coal stoker against the boarded window. Rock solid. Will looks for a way out. The stairs. \nWILL Stairs. \nSuddenly they HEAR FOOTSTEPS, above. They look up as dust falls from one side of the roof, slowly making its way to directly over them. To the stairs. \nEDDIE (whispering in fright) It's here. \nWill grabs on to Beverly's hand. She holds onto his with equal vigor. Richie holds onto Eddie. \nBen holds the stoker like a sword.     Mike grabs a shovel. They lead the way up the stairs. \nUnless otherwise noted, they ONLY WHISPER now. \nRICHIE I'm not going up there. \nThe others ignore him, follow Ben and Mike up the stairs. \nRichie looks around him at the scary basement, the furnace hulking in the corner like a being with eyes. The water surrounds his shoes. He runs up after his friends. \nINT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 1ST FLOOR \nA door opens in the middle of the kind of creepy hallway you don't want to find yourself in, ever. Scummy yellow water stained wallpaper peeling like dead skin from walls. Sconces hanging from their sockets and detritus is built up on the wooden floor boards. No footprints anywhere. \nBen sticks his head out. He looks left, nothing, he looks right, nothing. Directly in front of him, through a dark parlor, is the FRONT DOOR. \nAs Ben disappears into the stairs again, the door closes, revealing PENNYWISE THE CLOWN, at the far end of the hallway. \nINT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, BASEMENT STAIRS \nBen still has his hand on the door knob. \nBEN The front door is right there. \nWill nods.    Let's go. \nINT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 1ST FLOOR \nRICHIE You gotta a better idea? \nGlass breaks and CROWS STORM OUT OF A WINDOW behind them. Startled, they all lose their footing and fall, crashing down onto a pile of rope below. \nINT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 1ST FLOOR, KITCHEN \nEddie looks to the shaking fridge. Blood oozes out of it and starts to cover the floor, inching towards him. Eddie backs away, horrified. \nEDDIE No. No no no. Will?     Help me! \nINT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 2ND FLOOR BEDROOM \nWill sees the blood, looks to Ben and Mike. \nWILL What do we do? \nBEN We can't leave him alone down there. \nMike looks at the old moldy mattress. \nINT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 1ST FLOOR, KITCHEN \nEddie hops onto a rocking chair as the whole floor is coated with BLOOD. \nEDDIE Hurry, guys! \nThe fridge door starts to YAWN OPEN. Eddie curls in a ball and closes his eyes. \nEDDIE (CONT'D) This isn't happening. This isn't happening. \nInside is Pennywise, all curled up. He unfurls himself like a coiled snake, holding a balloon on a string. It drags him, floating just above the bloody floor, across the room toward Eddie. \nPENNYWISE Open your eyes Eddie-bear. I brought you some cracker-jack. \nEDDIE Go away! \nPENNYWISE Away? But I just got here? And we're gonna have soooooo much fun, you and me. Now open those peepers. \nEDDIE No. \nPENNYWISE Kee-mon Eddie Bear. Don'cha wanna see the show? You're the main event. \nEddie does. Pennywise is over him now, his teeth like razors, his clawed hands reaching out for Eddie's neck. \nPENNYWISE (CONT'D) You all taste soooooooo much better when you're afraid. \nEddie screeeeeeeeeams! \nINT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 2ND FLOOR \nMike lifts up the mattress and sees a decomposed corpse of some child underneath it. He screams, falling backwards towards Will and Ben. \nINT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, KITCHEN \nSUDDENLY ALL THREE OF THEM \nFall onto Pennywise, smacking into the floor, blood splattering the walls, impact cushioned by Pennywise's body. They instantly fall to the side. \nWill, Mike and Ben look over to see what broke their fall- a just as startled Pennywise, writhing in anger. \nWILL Ah, fuck! \nEddie scurries away from Pennywise, who bares his fangs at Will. \nCRASH! \nJust then the board from the window rips off to Richie, Stan and Beverly. \nShe fires a bottle rocket at Pennywise's face, exploding right into his eye. The clown reels back howling. \nRichie and Ben jump in and grab Eddie. \nPennywise pulls the rocket out of his burned socket and growls at the boys, morphing into an ORANGE GAS that shoots back into the fridge. \nEddie, Ben and Richie climb to safety through the window, while Will watches from the window frame Pennywise's escape. \nEXT. EDDIE KASPBRAK'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe kids BANG on Mrs. Kaspbrak's door. She opens it, sees his broken arm and freaks. \nEXT. EDDIE KASPBRAK'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER \nMrs. Kaspbrak is placing Eddie in the front seat of their family car. He is delirious with pain. \nMRS. KASPBRAK You! You all did this! \nShe slams the door shut, hurting Eddie on the inside.   The kids are all too spooked to talk coherently. \nMRS. KASPBRAK (CONT'D) You know how delicate he is! \nRICHIE We were attacked, Mrs. K. Travis BOWERS AND-- \nMRS. KASPBRAK Stop it! Just stop it! If it weren't for you boys and that little tramp they'd have nothing against my Eddie-bear... Ohh, where are my keys? \nShe's nearly in tears searching her purse. She dumps it out on the ground, prescription bottles, used kleenex's, food, deflated balloons. Gets on her knees and picks through it. \nMRS. KASPBRAK (CONT'D) Eddie's done with you kids, you hear? \nShe gets up when she finds the car key, speaking with such vitriolic focus, she seems possessed. \nMRS. KASPBRAK (CONT'D) Don't come around here again, you don't deserve him. You're reckless, churlish little boys. (TO WILL) This is why your little brother died, William, because you are a LOSER, a reckless reckless reckless loser. God help me if I were one of your parents. \nShe gets in the car and screeches away towards the hospital. They ALL watch the car disappear down the street. \nIn back, Heroux turns to the last man cowering in the corner: Stugley Grenier. He takes a swing and Stugley ducks it, ax splintering the floor. \nStugley scrambles into the OUTHOUSE and closes the door behind. Heroux, now totally slicked with blood, stalks over and begins chopping his way in. \nHe finds the windowless room empty. A sound comes from deep in the pooping hole. He looks down just in time to see... \nStugley's boots disappear through the pool of shit and piss. \nHeroux steps out of the outhouse into the carnage of the back room. Exhausted and bloody from tip to toe, he takes a seat at the card table, props his ax next to him, and starts drinking what's left of the slaughtered men's beers. \nNo one in the saloon seems to pay much mind to this. No one except Pennywise at the piano, who takes great pleasure in the scene and the ditty he's playing, a greasy white smile on his giddy, evil face... \nINT. BEN'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - DAY \nThe Loser's Club sits in front of Ben. \nBEN And that is the story of the Silver Dollar Saloon. \nThey look horrified. \nRICHIE The point of telling us was? \nBen looks at Will. \nWILL                            BEVERLY I think it's pretty obvious.      Derry's not just haunted, it's cursed. \nMIKE Just like my pa was trying to warn me the night I met you guys. \nBEN That clown, whatever \"IT\" is, has been around Derry doing nasty things for a long long time. The Black Spot fire. The Bradley Gang massacre. All the way back to the first settlers who disappeared. \nRichie holds up a dog-eared copy of \"A History of Old Derry\". \nRICHIE                               STAN I don't know, man.   That         Lumberjack. FLAPJACK STORY-- \nRICHIE Whatevs. It sounds like bunk to me. Didn't the guy who wrote this go insane or something? \nWILL Exactly. No one listened to him like no one listens to us. And unless we do something, \"IT's\" never going to stop. \nSTAN What do you mean, us, Will?    We're just kids. \nBEVERLY We hurt it at Neibolt.   That's gotta mean something. \nMIKE Everything dies. \nRichie looks at Mike, rolls his eyes. \nWILL We can kill it. \nRICHIE Okay Schwarzenegger twins, simmer down. We can't even free Eddie from \"mom jail\" let alone take down some freaky shape-shifter with a mind- meld on all the adults of Derry. However, I do believe we could sell this story to \"Tales from the crypt.\" \nBEN                             STAN No, no. This is far too         I don't want to see \"it\" whacked for \"Tales.\"            again. Ever. \nWILL I don't think that's a choice, Stan. \"IT\" knows we know. We hurt it. It's going to want to hurt us back. \nMIKE It's only a matter of time one of us is found half eaten in the Barrens. Or worse. \nThis is too much for Stan. He grabs his backpack. \nSTAN I need to study for my bar-mitzvah. \nStan goes. All the kids look to each other. \nBEVERLY He's just scared. \nWILL We're all scared. That's what it feeds off of. I heard the clown tell Eddie as much. Our only defense is to stick together. \nRICHIE Yeah well, the only time I've been spooked is when I'm with you jokers. I'm thinking I might be safer at home. At least I know my parents won't try to kill me. \nRichie goes too, leaving just the four. \nINT. WILL'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY \nWill enters the back door and grabs Stan's invitation for his Bar-Mitzvah off the fridge: \nHAROLD AND RUTH URIS CORDIALLY INVITE YOU TO THE BAR-MITZVAH OF THEIR SON STANLEY URIS ON SATURDAY, AUGUST 13TH, 1988 \nHe hears fighting in the hallway. \nSHARON Put it back up there! Put it back now! \nZACH I just thought, someone else-- \nINT. WILL'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nHis mother stands in the way of his father who holds the chest of Georgie's toys. \nSHARON I don't care about anyone else. I care about Georgie. I care about my little boy who's gone. \nWILL Hey. \nThey both startle and look at Will standing there. \nZACH Willy, we need a minute-- \nWILL Why? To scream at each other more? \nSHARON This is between your father and me. \nWILL And Georgie right? You, dad, and Georgie. \nZACH Willy, stop. \nWILL No. You stop. I hate   it. Tip toeing around you guys like   I don't exist. Like I'm the one who   died and the only one who's still   here is Ge-- \nShe stumbles back into the bathroom and shuts the door, trying to lock herself inside. He kicks the door open before the lock catches. \nWithout thinking Bev grabs the toilet top and smashes it in her dad's face. He slumps down, unconscious. \nShe rushes out, then uses a chair propped against the knob to shut him in the bathroom. Terrified she races out the front door. \nINT. EDDIE KASPBRAK'S HOUSE - DAY \nEddie stands in front of his mom, eyes blazing. \nMRS. KASPBRAK Placebo? Who told you that? Dr. Handor? He has no right. No right to say you're making up your sickness. \nEDDIE Not me, momma... You. \nMRS. KASPBRAK What? \nEDDIE He said I was never allergic until you made me start carrying around my Epi-pen. You put those allergies in my head. \nMRS. KASPBRAK That's a lie, Eddie! A bold faced lie. You're my treasure. The only thing I want in this world is to see you safe and healthy. \nEDDIE Then why did you send my friends away? \nShe starts to feel the fluttery bird of panic. \nMRS. KASPBRAK They were bad boys. You know that. And you... You were so sick when you were little. So very sick. It hurt me so much. I never want to see you go through that again. And I've kept you healthy, haven't I? \nEDDIE You lied to me mamma. You've been giving me medicine that's not really medicine. \nMRS. KASPBRAK Eddie-bear, please-- \nEDDIE This is what's going to happen now. \nHe pulls out his Epi-pen and throws it in the trash.   Mrs. Kaspbrak gasps. \nEDDIE (CONT'D) I'm going out that door and you won't stop me. I'm going to my friend Stan's bar-mitzvah and when I come home you're never going to tell how weak or sick or delicate I am ever again. \nTHUNDER crackles outside. \nEXT. DERRY STREETS - DAY \nWill and Mike tear through the howling rain on their bikes. They almost collide into Beverly who comes dashing around a corner. \nWILL Bev. You okay? \nBEVERLY No. No I'm not. \nShe looks back over her shoulder, terrified and wet and shivering. \nMIKE What happened. Bowers? \nBEVERLY No.   My daddy. He... he... \nWILL What?   What did he do Beverly? \nShe looks at both of them, tears running down her face, her pretty dress soaked in the rain. \nBEVERLY I don't know. I don't know if it was him, or... \nMIKE What? \nBEVERLY I think \"IT\" was there, controlling him, I don't know, I can't go back, I can't go back, Will. I don't know WHAT- \nShe starts to cry on Will's shoulder. Will looks at Mike. They both look up at the convulsive yellow sky. SOMETHING BIG is about to happen and they both know it. \nINT. SYNAGOGUE - DAY \nWith torrential downpour outside, leaking water drips from the ceiling onto the crowd below, who have cheerfully employed umbrellas indoor to deal with the nuisance. \nStan is giving a nervous, but otherwise successful reading of the Torah, despite the howling wind and end of days vibe. \nRichie and Ben sit in the back in their little jackets. \nBEN This storm is crazy.   Like the sky's gonna fall. \nSLAM! Everyone looks back towards the door, blown open by the wind, and at Eddie, who sheepishly was trying to slip in. \nStan smiles at his friend, pleased he's out of \"mom jail.\" The CANTOR gives him a nudge and continues reading. \nEddie slides in meekly next to Richie and Ben, checking his clip-on bowtie. \nRICHIE (through his teeth) Way to make an entry, Eddie-bear. \nBEN How'd you escape? \nEDDIE Guess I'm not as weak as I thought. \nINT. TRAVIS BOWER'S HOUSE - DAY \nThe front door creaks open, Victor and Snatch poking their heads in, both soaked to the bone. \nSNATCH Travis? \nVICTOR Mr. Bowers? \nNothing. They see a streak of blood on the floor that leads to the KITCHEN and Butch Bowers on the linoleum floor in a red pool, stabbed dozens of times, the knife left in his eye. \nSNATCH Holy shit. \nVictor vomits.   The cat slips in and starts licking up the blood. \nSNATCH (CONT'D) Travis, dude, you okay? \nSnatch continues on into the LIVING ROOM where he finds TRAVIS sitting in Butch's favorite Lazy-boy in front of the TV, which is turned on to PENNYWISE THE CLOWN SHOW. \nEXT. OLD IRONWORKS - DAY \nThe losers -- ALL 7 OF THEM -- stand on the threshold of the Old Ironworks cellar hold, the very same one PATRICK HOCKSTETTLER died in... a yawning chasm of mud, pools of water and hulking, shattered old boilers. \nThe rain and wind howls, lightning cracking overhead. Will points to a huge SEWER PIPE that juts out of the muck. \nWILL (YELLING) This is our only way into Derry's original sewer system before it was sealed off and modernized. \nBLING! \nA bullet sparks off a iron post next to Will's head. \nTravis, Snatch and Victor stand at the crest of the road leading to the factory. Travis has his dad's gun, aimed like Dirty Harry at them. He pops off another round, BLANG-PING. \nBEN Oh, fuck! \nWill grabs Bev's hand, who grabs Ben's who grab's Eddie's and on down the line. They follow Will around the cellar hold to a giant conveyor belt toppled against the edge. They scale down it into the chasm, bullets pinging around them. \nCLICK CLICK CLICK. Travis runs out of ammo.     He throws the gun away and pulls out the bloody knife. \nVICTOR Man, this is where Patrick Hockstettler went missing. \nSNATCH No way I'm going down there. \nTravis glares at Snatch, PENNYWISE appearing near the boy in a flash of lightning. \nTravis lunges with the knife and plunges it into Snatch's tummy. Victor watches in horror. \nTRAVIS (TO VICTOR) Still have second thoughts? \nVictor shakes his head no. Snatch stumbles back and plunges into the darkness of the cellar hold... \nINT. CELLAR HOLD - SAME \nSMACK! Snatch's lifeless body slams into the muck right in front of Will and the others. \nEDDIE Oh my God oh my God! \nWILL Don't look back! \nThey dart into the blackness of the huge, rusty pipe. \nTravis turns back to Victor, a dull craze in his eyes.   He gestures to the conveyor the kids climbed down. \nTRAVIS After you. \nINT. SEWER TUNNELS - DAY \nThe losers follow Will, who uses his dad's map to lead them deeper and deeper into the sewers which roar and chime with rushing water. They turn a corner and come to... \nA DEAD END \nThe stream of water seems to disappear under the stone wall there. Everyone is terrified. \nBEVERLY Now what? \nSTAN Uh, guys? \nHe shines his light on something in the corner... \nWILL There's suppose to be a tunnel here. The last tunnel that's shown on the map. \nIt's a SHOE.    Eddie comes over it. \nEDDIE Dorsey's other shoe. \nStan sweeps his flashlight up the wall.   What he finds makes Richie spring back. \nRICHIE Uh, guys! \nScrawled in blood on the stones is a warning: \nSTOP NOW OR I'LL KILL YOU ALL! WORD TO THE WISE FROM PENNYWISE \nMIKE Pennywise? \nBEN Shit, \"IT\" has a name. \nFootsteps echo from behind them. \nWILL Keep moving! \nStan finds a loose stone. \nSTAN Here.   Will, over here. \nThey all kick at the stones, which give way to... \nINT. SEWER TUNNELS - DAY \nTravis and Victor race down the tunnels after them. They turn the corner and come to the dead end, a pile of stones kicked out from a BLACK HOLE. Travis kneels down and looks into it. He can see Will and the gang's FLASHLIGHTS... \nTRAVIS I seeeeeeeeeee yooooooouuuu losers! \nINT. BLACK HOLE - DAY \nWill and the others slosh on their hands and knees down the hole, with roots and bursting through its stone ribs. \nIt grows narrower and narrower to the point of complete and utter claustrophobia. Mike looks back past Ben and sees... \nTwo shadowy figures crawling toward them. \nMIKE Hurry! \nWILL It doesn't matter what it calls itself. What matters is it's afraid to show us what it really is. Which means we can beat it. \nWill sees Beverly over by one of the waterfalls. \nBEVERLY Guess I'm going first again? \nWILL Beverly, wait-! \nShe jumps into the waterfall and it sweeps her up up up to the ceiling. \nWill and the boys swap holy shit looks.   Ben jumps in after her, then Will, Mike, and Stan. \nRichie looks to Eddie, who has the same terrified look as at the quarry. He holds out his hand. \nRICHIE You still afraid of a little grey water? \nEDDIE You still wear diapers at night? \nEddie grabs Richie's hand and they jump into the waterfall together. They are swept up up up into... \nINT. THE REFLECTING POOL ON THE CEILING - CONTINUOUS \nPlunging into the pool with the others. For a moment they all flap and kick under water, unsure which way is up, then Bev grabs them both and pulls them to the surface. \nThey're upside down now, the oculus opening to space below them, gravity seeming to work by its own rules in here.. \nWILL We all here? \nRichie looks back where they just \"fell\" from. \nRICHIE Mind equals blown right now. \nThe camera flips around and THE WORLD RIGHTS ITSELF, the oculus now above. The pool, which seemed small before, is now enormous -- like a dark, brooding lake -- the crypt island very far from them. \nMIKE This is nothing like what it looked like from below. \nEDDIE It's in our head. All the stuff we see. It's like the allergies my mom said I had. We make it real. \nSTAN We do.   Or IT? \nWILL Guys, the island.    Let's swim. \nThey splash toward the crypt island. Ben is the first to feel something brush past his leg. A replay of the quarry. \nBEN Not funny, Richie. \nHe looks back and sees no one.   Richie is a couple of lengths to his left. \nRICHIE What? \nBen suddenly realizes.   Bev also feels something on her foot. \nBEVERLY The water. There's something in the water with us. \nSuddenly a WORMY TENTACLE extends from the water behind Mike. Will sees it and whacks it away with his baseball bat. \nWILL Hurry! \nThe kids hustle it freestyle across the pool for the island. \nWE PULL BACK WIDE TO SEE a monstrously big, faintly outlined starfish-like creature with an orange glowing eye, lurking in the depths of the reflecting pool. \nWill, then Bev, then Richie dodge a tentacle and all get to the island. Stan is not far behind, with Mike, Eddie and Ben taking the rear, swatting back more tentacles. \nFrom under Stan the ORANGE EYE APPEARS, the dark water around him suddenly aglow. He looks down into it and it becomes clear the eye is really a mouth, and the orange is coming from deep inside its bowels -- THE DEADLIGHTS. \nStan looks directly into them and is mesmerized, so much so that he stops swimming. \nWILL (CONT'D) Stan what are you doing! \nParalyzed, Stan starts to sink toward the deadlights when Mike, shielding his eyes, grabs Stan and swims him back to the surface. \nAll the kids give cover with their weapons -- shooting flares, swinging the sledgehammer, impaling with the stake, using the hubcap as a shield -- so that Mike, helped by Ben and Eddie, can drag Stan onto the island. \nEDDIE                             BEVERLY Stan? Stan, are you okay?       Stan! \nHe stares blankly ahead, as if his mind was wiped blank. \nWILL (CONT'D) Stan, it's us. You in there buddy? \nAnother tentacle squirms out of the water toward them. Ben shoots it with a crossbow. It goes slithering back in. \nBEN Guys. I don't think this is the best place to hang out right now. \nEDDIE Stanley, snap out of it. \nStan blinks conscious.   He looks at them all. \nSTAN Where am I? \nRICHIE The worst and only bar mitzvah party you will ever have. \nThey help Stan to his feet. Mike looks back over his shoulder for the monster. \nMIKE Guys, the water thing.    IT's gone. \nIndeed, the reflecting pool is placid as ice. \nWill looks back to the crypt, an obsidian stone heptagon- shaped structure the size of one of Mike's killing pens. \nWILL Maybe. Or just changing into something else. \nEDDIE What do you mean? \nMike with crow bar, Stan with chainsaw, Ben with a hub cap shield and sledgehammer, Richie with his hockey stick stake, Eddie with a nail gun. Will grabs his bat and joins them. \nPennywise tries to fend off this \"Lord of the Flies\" rebellion, becoming bigger, fiercer, more grotesque, but the kids are too much. Just when they have \"IT\" bleeding and backed into a corner for the death blow... \nPENNYWISE Wait! \nWill grabs Ben's sledgehammer. The creature that looks up at them isn't Pennywise but... GEORGIE \nPENNYWISE/GEORGIE Please, Willy. Please don't hurt me. \nWILL You're not Georgie. \nPENNYWISE/GEORGIE I am. I'm in here, Willy. We all are. This is the place we float. \nBEVERLY Will, it's a trick. \nPENNYWISE/GEORGIE It's not your fault Willy. Not you're fault I'm stuck here. But you're hurting us all. \nMIKE It's trying to get to you, Will. Kill it. Kill it now. \nWILL No!   I have to think. \nPENNYWISE/GEORGIE Mom and dad they should know. They should know it's not your fault. I'll tell `em. I'll tell `em as long as you don't hurt us anymore. \nWill is confused. This is the one thing he wanted to hear. Beverly hands him his satchel with the car flares. \nBEVERLY Finish him, Will. For all of us. For Georgie. \nWill looks to the scared little boy on the ground. \nRICHIE I'm taking this fucker out. \nWILL No. \nWill grabs his stake away. He turns to Georgie.   Kneels down. Takes his wet little head in his hands. \nWILL (CONT'D) I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't go out there with you. I'm sorry I was sick. \nGEORGIE It's okay, Willy. I know. Everything'll be okay. \nWILL DOES THE CALL BACK AND SOMETHING IN THE WAY GEORGIE RESPONDS SNAPS WILL OUT OF HIS STUPOR. GEORGIE'S GONE \nWILL Hairspray. \nBev sprays it through his lit flare.   Torching Georgie. \nGEORGIE No!   No Willy! Please! \nGEORGIE REVERTS BACK TO PENNYWISE, screaming horribly and lunging at the kids one last time. IT finally gives up, slumping to the floor dead, a black charred clownish corpse. \nRichie touches the remains and they deflates, almost as if a balloon. \nThe trapdoor above them blows away, as if it were sucked off by a cyclone, out of the oculus, and into what looks like the stars of outer space. \nEDDIE Did we kill it? \nWill isn't sure, he looks at the rest of them. \nMIKE You did it, Will. \nBev hugs him.   Ben watches, enviously. \nRICHIE It's miller ti-- \nSuddenly the GRAVITY SPELL WEARS OFF and the kids all fall to the ceiling of the stone crypt. Bev almost falls out into space, caught by Ben just in time. \nThe water from the waterfalls and from the reflecting pool all collapse back toward the floor, along with some of the stones in the crypt around them, which begins to crumble. \nAt first the losers hang on, afraid to fall, but eventually they lose grip and fall toward the oculus, which has begun to fill up with the water from the falls and reflecting pool. \nThey all plunge safely into the new pool below, Will's foot kicking out the bottom of it into outer space before being pulled back by Stan. \nWILL We've got to get out of here. \nINT. DERRY SEWERS - DAY \nThe losers hurry their way out of the sewers, storm water quickly rising around them. Will leads the way with a car flare. They come to another dead-end grate. \nRICHIE Shit! \nWILL We'll get out. C'mon. \nINT. ANOTHER PIPE - LATER \nThey continue to look for a way out, the water now up to their chests. The losers look cold, lost, and in despair. \nSTAN We're going to drown down here aren't we? \nEDDIE                           MIKE I'm so cold.                      All this water. It's still going to win. \nWILL No. I don't know-- \nBEN We're dead. So dead. \nBEVERLY Guys, stop it. Focus. \nEveryone turns to Bev. Their muse. Their light. \nSHE TAKES EDDIE'S FACE IN HER HANDS \nSHE TAKES STAN'S FACE IN HER HANDS \nSHE TAKES RICHIE'S FACE IN HER HANDS \n", "test1_input": "SEVERAL multi-acre, manure filled sheep pens stand empty.

HANLON ABATTOIR, OUTDOOR PEN - DAY \nLEROY HANLON (50s) works to move the sheep into line while his son MIKE HANLON (13) watches from behind him. \nLEROY Open the gate. \nMIKE I'm sick of this, dad. \nLEROY People need to eat.   Now open the gate. \nMike opens the gate. \nMIKE How would you feel if you were one of them? \nLeroy, haunted by this thought answers gruffly- \nLEROY Humans aren't raised to be food. \nAs if he were lying, that humans sometimes ARE raised for food. \nThe sheep flood into a thinner pathway leading to the interior of the complex. Leroy watches them as does Mike. \nMIKE Everyday, watching them stupidly walk into that killing pen. This isn't a normal kid's life. You won't even let me go to school. \nINT. HANLON ABATOIR, SLAUGHTER PEN - DAY \nLeroy takes the cattle bolt, places it on the head of the first sheep. WOOMPH. The sheep drops dead. \nLEROY Now why would you want to be in public school with the rest of those people down below, in Derry? \nHe hands it to Mike, expectantly. Mike dispassionately takes the mechanism and approaches a sheep. \nMIKE Because I want to be in boring classes with other boring kids and draw pictures in text books and play baseball and go to dances and grind. \nHe places it on the head of the next sheep, but can't bring himself to pull the trigger. \nLeroy does it for him.   WOOMPH.   The sheep drops dead. \nLEROY I know, son. I get it. But you aren't like those people. We may work with sheep, but those people are sheep. Trust me. \nThe last point Leroy believes in like gospel. \nA SCHOOL BELL RINGS \nEXT. DERRY MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY \nDoors fling open and ROWDY 6TH, 7TH, and 8TH GRADERS spill out. Books are hurled in the trash, papers strewn all over the recess yard -- summer is officially commenced. \nSwept up among this madness is... \nWILL DENBROUGH (13) \nHandsome, gangly, red-headed, the memory of his brother still fresh. He walks with his dorky friends, all talking over each other: EDDIE KASPBRAK, his EPI-PEN JR. (an adrenaline injector for kids with life-threatening allergies) holstered in his medicine-filled fannypack; STAN URIS (12), a trim and tidy Jewish kid who dresses like a mini-accountant; and RICHIE TOZIER, the neighbor with the walkie-talkie, a comic book and video game freak with bug-eye glasses. \nEDDIE So how's it work? \nSTAN                           RICHIE What work?                        So long suckas! \nRichie flips off the school. \nWILL Richie! \nEDDIE The ceremony. Your Bar Mitzvah. \nWILL It makes you officially a man right? \nSTAN                             RICHIE Kind of. I read verses. From      Then a seventh dimensional the Torah.                        door opens up and Stan here has to slay his Ronin master over a pit of death. He wins his schlong grows like six inches. \nSTAN Shit, I don't need a Bar Mitzvah for that. \nRichie howls. \nWILL Just your mom's Cosmo. \nEDDIE Marie Claire. \nRICHIE Vogue man. It's all perfumed. I put on my 3-D glasses and it's like you're there. \nRichie \"motor boats\" the air in front of him. \nANGLE on a GROUP OF fashionably dressed GIRLS NEARBY. The bigger, heavier one of the group notices someone off screen. \nGIRL #1 There's the ho-bag, now. \nPAN to see BEVERLY MARSH (13) a dazzling cloud of auburn hair and lovely green-gray eyes. Her clothes aren't as nice as the group of popular girls, but she holds her head high. \nGIRL #2 She's the one all the eighth grade boys talk about. \nGIRL #1                     GIRL #1 (CONT'D) They say she gives the best     Probably the only way she can bjs.                            afford those rags she wears. Give me your rings, Gretta. \nBeverly sees the girls as Girl #1 puts Gretta's rings on her fingers. Sensing trouble, she turns around and ducks right back into school. \nGIRL #1 Hey cock breath, come here! \nPAN back to WILL and his dorky friends.   Eddie stops dead, POINTING TO- \nEDDIE Jesus, she's still here? \nThe RABBI'S WIFE, sleepless and desperate, lurks on the edge of school property, scanning the throngs of departing kids with desperate eyes.

His glasses fall off and a pile of comics and video game magazines spill from his back pack. \nTRAVIS Sorry chode. Didn't see you. \nTravis kicks the glasses away. His thug sidekicks laugh: SNATCH HUGGINS (15), PATRICK HOCKSTETTLER (17) and VICTOR CRISS (15) -- one a lunkhead oaf, another a perpetually giggly fire-starting sociopath, and the last one a scrap and scab junk yard dog type. \nVictor grabs Stan's yarmulka and tosses it into the window of a departing bus. \nVICTOR Frisbee, fuck nut. \nSnatch burps in Eddie's face. Eddie wilts under the smell. Will scoops up the remains of Richie's glasses, smashed by the bus. \nWILL You suck, Bowers! \nTravis and his goons turn. They glare at Will menacingly. \nTRAVIS You say something? \nEveryone around them stops and watches, waiting for Will to respond. Eddie gives Will a look to shut it. He does. \nTRAVIS (CONT'D) Thought so. You got a free ride this year because of your little brother. But ride's over, Denbrough.

EMERGENCY EXIT - DERRY HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nA door opens by the dumpsters and out peaks BEN HANSCOM (13), the \"lard ass\" in question, making sure the coast is clear. He wears an oversized sweatshirt and a pair of girly high- waisted blue jeans. \nBEVERLY Soooo, you gonna let me go by or is there a secret password or something? \nHe turns to see Beverly. \nBEN Sorry. \nHe steps aside. Beverly tip-toes past, lighting a cigarette like a pro. \nBEVERLY \"Sorry\"'s not much of a password. Now \"kittyhawk,\" that's a good one. \nBEN Ballyhoo? \nBEVERLY Riproar. \nBEN Barnburner. \nBeverly smiles and offers Ben a smoke. He refuses. She shrugs and blows a smoke ring in his face. \nBEVERLY If you're worried about Bowers and his merry band of a-holes hassling you, don't. I saw them all leave out front. \nBEN Thanks. \nBEVERLY You're the new kid right? I'm-- \nBEN (BLURTING) Beverly Marsh. \nA little too quick. His ears turn red with embarrassment. \nBEN (CONT'D) I just know `cuz we were in social studies. Together, in the same class. You know, like the constitution test, and stuff. (realizing he's vomiting NONSENSE) I'm Ben. \nBev smiles, knowingly. It's clear he likes her. Ben notices a FAINT YELLOW BRUISE on her forearm. Bev notices him noticing. \nBEVERLY (off Ben's look) I slipped in the shower. What's your excuse? \nBEN I fell on three boxes of donuts. \nBeverly laughs. \nBEVERLY Well, see ya around Ben from sosh class. \"Get laid in the shade.\" \nBEN Uh, you too, Beverly. \"Stay cool.\" \nBen watches her go, totally smitten. \nBEVERLY K.I.T. \nINT. WILL DENBROUGH'S HOUSE - DAY \nDust collects on the piano in the living room. A stale quiet suffocates the house. The only sound the ticking of a clock and the distant yelling of playing children. \nINT. WILL DENBROUGH'S HOUSE - WILL'S ROOM - SAME \nWill Denbrough laces his shoes. As he leaves his room, he notices the door to George's room is open, his FATHER, ZACH DENBROUGH (30s), lost in thought notices him. \nZACH (WITHOUT EMPHASIS) Hey Champ. Going out to play? \nWILL Yeah, Dad. \nWill looks like he wants to say more, but doesn't have the words to articulate it. \nINT.

Her sheets and pillows are smeared with blood. Her face crusted with dried gore. \nGroggy, and nearly sleep walking, she sits up and walks out without taking stock. \nINT. BEVERLY'S BATHROOM - MORNING \nBev opens the door, wiping her eyes she approximates the sink, bends over to wash her face and eyes. With the first crust of blood removed from her eyelids, she looks into the mirror and let's out a choked, exhaling GASP of horror. \nSurrounded by brown and crusty wallpaper, is Beverly's realization that the blood was not a dream. \nBeverly's Mom appears in the doorway.   Beverly turns to her, speechless, in shock. \nMRS. MARSH Darling, sometimes I look at myself in the morning and think the same thing. \nBeverly tiptoes out of the horror scene. She shyly looks at her mother as she dries her hair over a blood-drenched sink, oblivious to it all. \nMRS. MARSH (CONT'D) Look at these roots. \nBeverly is speechless. \nINT. HANDLON ABATTOIR - DAY \nPuddles of BLOOD seem to lap like small waves towards us. PAN UP to reveal Mike and Leroy sweeping the blood and water out of the slaughtering pen. \nOfficer Bowers followed by SEVERAL POLICE OFFICERS enter the facility. \nOFFICER BOWERS Leroy Hanlon? \nLeroy turns and notices the officers for the first time. \nOFFICER BOWERS (CONT'D) We need to bring in your boy for questioning. \nLEROY For what? \nOFFICER BOWERS Police business. \nMike turns to his father, frightened, shaking his head. \nLEROY We need a lawyer? \nHe looks at Mike, searching for any indication what this could be about. Travis appears in the distance and Mike instantly knows. \nMIKE Dad, it's- \nOfficer Bowers roughly grabs Mike by the neck and starts to lead him out. \nOFFICER BOWERS Let's go, boy. \nLEROY Hey!   No need for that. \nHe grabs Officer Bowers by the arm. Bowers quickly and excessively puts Leroy in a wrist lock and throttles him against the killing pen fence. Leroy moans in pain. \nOFFICER BOWERS Search this place, now. It's the perfect place to hide a body if you ever needed to. \nOfficer Bowers looks around in disgust.   Travis smiles from the safety of distance and local power. \nLEROY This ain't right! You need a warrant, you can't just- \nLeroy seizes his arm, then his chest, then crumples to the ground, losing consciousness in the puddle of blood. \nMIKE Dad! \nMike tries to rush for him but he is forcefully escorted to a waiting police car.

An aimless summer morning with nothing to do. They play with his junk and are generally turning his room over. Will examines a pair of walkie-talkies not unlike his own. \nRICHIE Whoa, what's with the history project, Benny-boy? \nRichie notices that Ben's walls are covered in xerox copies and historical drawings, all relating to Derry's history. \nBEN Oh, uh, when I first moved here I didn't have anyone to play with or anything, so I just started hanging out in the Library. \n", "test2_true": "RICHIE                          EDDIE What are you, the \"Reading      He's a regular Jordy Laforge.

Been that way since the original settlers. \nWill, who was more interested in a Viewmaster, turns and looks at the walls now. Sees a copy of an old-timey document with 300 signatures. INCORPORATION OF THE TOWNSHIP OF DERRY. \nWILL You have a copy of the Town Charter. Seriously? \nBEN Derry started as a logging camp before it was officially on any maps. 300 people signed the charter that made Derry Derry. A month later they all disappeared, without a trace. \nRICHIE The entire town? \nEddie is freaked out by this revelation. \nBEN The people, the livestock, everything that was alive. \nSTAN                              EDDIE Jesus.                          Holy fuck. \nRICHIE (TO STAN) Aren't you supposed to be Jewish? \nStan thumps Richie in the stomach while still paying attention to Ben. \nBEN People in neighboring settlements thought it was Indians or something but there was no sign of an attack. The only clue was a well house that was burnt down to charcoal. \nRICHIE Shit, maybe we could get Derry on Unsolved Mysteries! \nBen points out on an old map that has a translucent modern map drawn by hand laid over it, his tracing coordinates- \nBEN It was here. Right on the corner of what's now Witcham and Jackson. \nEDDIE Hey, isn't that where Will's brother, Georgie- \nRichie slaps Eddie in the back of the head. His fierce eyes castigating Eddie for not thinking before speaking, Eddie confused, \"wha-?\" \nWILL Yeah, it's where Georgie died. \nBEN                            RICHIE I'm sorry.    I didn't-              (to Eddie) Good job numb nuts. \nWILL (CONT'D) Don't worry about it. Why do you have all this stuff anyway? I mean. What are you going to do with it? \nWill can't take his eyes off all of the information. \nBEN I don't know. It was just a way to kill time, I guess. \nRICHIE It's summer, dorkus. If you're gonna kill time, do it right. \nEXT. BASSEY PARK QUARRY, ROPE SWING - LATER \nWill, Richie, Eddie, Stan, and Ben, stripped to their tightie- whities (except Ben who still has a T-shirt), stand in a line staring at the edge of a rocky outcropping in a quarry turned pond. The black water of the pond foreboding, endless. \nWILL Who's first. \nRICHIE Eddie? \nEDDIE Screw that. \nBEN I'll go. \nEDDIE Ben, with those cuts you have on your chest, I'm not sure if getting in this water- \nRICHIE Will you stop with the grey water shit. You make it seem like any water we get in is like swimming in an out-house. \nBEN What's grey water? \nSTAN Don't get him started. \nWILL I'll go first. \nBEVERLY (O.C.) Too late. \nThe boys turn around to see Bev in a one piece summer dress. She pulls off the dress quickly, down to her underwear, sprints off the edge and jumps into the water. BOOM. Cannonball. \nThe boys, not wanting to be showed up by the girl take one last look at each other and jump in. SPLASH! SPLASH! SPLASH! SPLASH! SPLASH! \nAll except for Eddie, who crawls down the rock outcropping and stares at the screaming and laughing kids enviously. \nRICHIE What are you waiting for? Why don't you get in you pussy? \nEddie dips the toes of one of his feet in.   Flabbergasted, Richie gives up on motivating Eddie. \nRichie dives under the water and swims beneath the kicking legs of all his friends, a shark's P.O.V. He doesn't see... \nPENNYWISE floating in from the depths beneath him. \nOn the surface Ben yelps, something yanking his leg. Richie surfaces. \nBEN Very funny, Richie. \nRICHIE I thought so. \nSomething yanks Richie's leg too. Hard. He and Ben wait for whoever it was to surface from the inky water. \nBen sees Will, Bev, and Stan swimming back toward Eddie on the edge of the quarry. They scream and laugh and swim their asses back to land. \nEXT. BASSEY PARK QUARRY, SHORE - LATER \nThe SIX of them now sunbathe on the rocks at the edge of the pond. Their eyes are closed, soaking in the vitamin D, except Ben, who can't take his off of Beverly's tanning body. \n", "test2_id": 1018, "test3_input": "DR. HANDOR Mother knows best. Is that it? \nEddie shrugs. \nDr. Handor smiles, considering his next thought. He leans in, too close for comfort for Eddie. For a moment it's creepy. \nDR. HANDOR (CONT'D) Eddie, do you know what a placebo is? \nEXT. TRAVIS BOWER'S BACKYARD - DAY \nA bottle of Southern Comfort sits on a log. BLAM! \nBowers shoots at it with his dad's police issue .45. Victor and Snatch look on, giggling. \nHe finally tags it, the bottle shattering into a thousand pieces. They all whoop and holler. \nSNATCH Can I try? \nHe reaches for the gun.    Bowers pushes him back. \nTRAVIS Sure. Go put the next target out there. \nTravis points to the cat that's lounging there in the grass. \nSNATCH You're foolin' right? \nTRAVIS Do I look like I'm foolin' numb nuts? \nSnatch grabs the kitty and runs out to the stump. He wipes away the glass and sets the cat down. It starts to meow and tries to get away. \nSNATCH It's not staying. \nBower lines up a shot, sight of the barrel on the cat. \nTRAVIS Hold it there, butt cheese. \nOFFICER BOWERS (O.C.) What the hell is this? \nOfficer Bowers steps from his police cruiser in the driveway. His face as red as fire. \nTRAVIS Nothing, pa. Just cleaning your gun like you asked. \nOFFICER BOWERS Cleaning my gun, huh? \nHe stalks up and grabs the gun from Travis. Smells it. \nWHAP! He smacks Travis hard in the face, knocking the big boy to the grass. \nOFFICER BOWERS (CONT'D) Normally I use a rod and cleaner not bullets and whiskey. (MORE) \nOFFICER BOWERS (CONT'D) You two punks put your sticky little fingers on my firearm here? \nVictor and Snatch are too scared to talk. \nVICTOR N-N-No sir. \nButch turns the gun on Travis at his feet. \nOFFICER BOWERS You're not worth the salt you lick boy. I don't know how I let you squirm your way out your momma's womb. \nTRAVIS Pa, I'm--- \nBLAM! \nHe shoots the ground around     Travis feet. Travis squeals like a girl, utterly terrified.      BLAM! BLAM! A large wet stain spreads around his crotch.      Butch Bowers raises the pistol, as if he were about to whip     Travis, who falls to the ground. \nButch shakes his head. \nOFFICER BOWERS (to the boys) Look at him now boys. Nothing like a little fear to make a paper man crumble. (TO TRAVIS) Clean your drawers `fore you come inside. \nHe spits out his disgust, stalks inside. \nVictor and Snatch tip-toe over to Travis, not knowing what to say or do. Travis does everything he can not to cry. \nVICTOR You okay, Travis? \nAn odd wind stirs through the grass there, a yellow menacing gathering of clouds overhead. Travis suddenly notices... \nA BALLOON, bobbing over his mailbox, string connected to something stuffed inside. \nTravis pushes past his two cronies and goes over to the mailbox. Inside he pulls out THE KNIFE. The one he lost at the beginning. And attached to the string a note: \nTO:     MR. TRAVIS BOWERS FROM:   MR. ROBERT GRAY \nA murderous look screws onto Travis' face as he turns his attention to his house. And his pa inside. \nHe snaps the string and starts toward the front door with the knife. The balloon floats up into the darkening sky. \nINT. CORONER'S OFFICE - DAY \nA THUNDERCLAP outside. The coroner steps out the door. Will and Mike slip in behind him, Will propping open the door with his Walkie. \nMIKE Patrick was in one of the lockers. All the water bubbled up from there. \nThe drain. Will goes to it. Gazes down into the blackness. \nWILL The sewers. \nMIKE What? \nWILL \"IT.\" Whenever it shows up, there's always water around. The storm drain where Georgie died. The leak in my room. Beverly's sink. \nMIKE My dad saw it near water, too.      The canal. \n", "test3_true": "MIKE Unless you live way out in the sticks like I do. We have to tell the others. \nWill realizes something. \nWILL Shit, Stan's bar mitzvah.   I almost forgot. \nMIKE I wasn't invited. \nWill hands him his invite. \nWILL You are now. Let's go! \nA pair of YELLOW EYES glow from the drain. \nINT. BEVERLY'S APARTMENT - DAY \nBeverly, all gussied up in a pretty white dress, heads for the door. A hand snatches out from behind and seizes her arm. \nMR. MARSH Where you think you going girl? \nBEVERLY My friend's party. I told ma-- \nMR. MARSH You're all prettied up. Who you all prettied up for? \nBEVERLY No one. \nHe shoves her against the wall, eyes her little body up and down. Caresses her hair. \nMR. MARSH Don't lie to me, Bevvie. You know how I worry about you. I worry a lot. \nBEVERLY I know daddy. \nMR. MARSH People in town seen you. Got to sayin' things. Like how my little girl been sneakin' around all summer long with a pack of boys. Only girl to the pack. \nBEVERLY They're my friends, daddy. \nHe squeezes her cheeks with one hand, holding her head in place. \nMR. MARSH You sure about that, Bevvie? \nBEVERLY I-- I swear. They're just friends. \nMR. MARSH Friends? I know what's in them boys minds when they look at you, Bevvie. I know all too well. They want to do bad things. Did you let them do bad things to you? \nHe looms over her. Something in his manner is detached. Like he's there but isn't there. \nBEVERLY I'm a good girl daddy. Good, just like you raised me. \nMR. MARSH Is that so? Then what's this? \nHe pulls out Ben's Haiku Poem. \nBEVERLY WHERE'D YOU-- \nMR. MARSH You had it squirreled away in your underwear drawer. Why would you want to hide it with your underwear Bevvie? What else are you holdin' out from me. \nBEVERLY It's nothing, daddy.   Just a poem. \nMR. MARSH (RECITING) Your hair is winter fire, JANUARY EMBERS My heart burns there, too \nHe grabs her by the hair and pulls her up to him. \nMR. MARSH (CONT'D) Sounds lusty to me. Who wrote it. Which one of your boyfriends? \nBEVERLY I told you I don't have one. \nMR. MARSH Don't lie to me! \nHe drags her down the hall by the hair. \nBEVERLY Daddy stop. You're hurting me. \nMR. MARSH You're ma says you're a woman now. You bled. What other womanly things you been doing down in the deep dark woods with those boys, Bevvie. \nHe throws her into his bedroom. \nBEVERLY Nothing. Please, daddy. You don't have to worry. I promise. Please! \nMR. MARSH Let's see then. Prove to me you been good. \nShe doesn't know what he means. \nMR. MARSH (CONT'D) Take off your tights. \nBEVERLY What? \nMR. MARSH I love you Bevvie. You're special. You're such a pretty girl. But there's plenty of boys happy to roon a pretty girl. Plenty of pretty girls willing to be roont. I need to know if you're intact. \nHe unbuckles his belt, but he doesn't look at her like he wants to whip her, there's another hunger in his eyes. \nMR. MARSH (CONT'D) Your tights, girl. Take `em off. \nBEVERLY Daddy, please. \nHe slides off his belt and grabs her, smiling, a smile that feels all too reminiscent of a clown. \nMR. MARSH You'll like it, Bevvie.   Be like you're floating. \nBev kicks him in the balls. Her father lets go, crumpling down. She knees him in the face as hard as she can, his head flying back into the side of the door. \nBeverly tries to race out the door but he snatches her ankle and she trips into the hallway. By the time she is up he is lunging towards her. \n", "test3_id": 1019}

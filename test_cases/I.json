{"test1_input": "INT. HOSPITAL, CORRIDER - NIGHT \nMike steps out into the corridor. The hospital seems eerily dark, empty and quiet. \nA LIGHT STROBES down the long hall. It draws Mike to it, like a moth to a flame. He turns the corner and sees... \nA fire alarm pulled, white greasy fingerprints on the lever. Emergency lights strobe along the walls. No sound of an alarm. No doctors or nurses anywhere. \nSuddenly, at the end of the long corridor, a SHEEP trots out from a door, staccato in the strobing light. It stops, looks at Mike, then trots into another door. \nMike starts after it, baffled. He approaches the door the sheep walked into, a stream of WATER FLOODING OUT ONTO THE FLOOR. \nHe stops, the water rushing past his feet. He looks back behind him, the normally lit hallway now far far away. \nBAAA \nHe hears the sheep just inside the open door. He enters through it without noticing the stencil on the glass of the door: \"DERRY COUNTY CORONER.\" \nINT. HOSPITAL, CORONER'S OFFICE \nMike enters a windowless bunker like room with all the metal corpse lockers, metal autopsy table and a sink in the corner, the emergency lights still strobing. \nThe sheep is nowhere to be found. \nInstead Mike finds, in the middle of the floor under the autopsy table, a DRAIN GURGLING UP WATER, the source of the flooding out into the corridor. \nSLAM! \nThe door slams behind him. Mike runs over to it, jiggles the lock, but it won't open. Behind him, in between flashes of the strobe, PENNYWISE APPEARS THEN DISAPPEARS... \nMike stops dead, sensing It's presence like he did at the old Ironworks. He slowly looks back as... \nONE OF THE CORPSE LOCKER DOORS CREAK OPEN \nMike opens his mouth to scream but nothing comes out. \nHe's pounding on the door. \nMIKE Somebody! HELP! Let me out! (BEAT) Dad! Mom! \nHe looks over his shoulder while continuing to BANG. The tray inside the open locker slowly slides out, like a tongue from a mocking black mouth. On it, under a white sheet, is a CORPSE. \nMike dares look back just as the sheet catches and the corpse is uncovered. It's none other than PATRICK HOCKSTETTLER, whose legs and arms (up to the elbow) have been bit off, smaller, CHILD SIZE bite marks cover his body. \nMike jumps to a corner where he grabs a saw to defend himself. \nWater spews up from the drain with more and more pressure, a pool now covering the floor, the edge of which seeps toward Mike. \nMike climbs up on a chair, afraid of the water, now with a full view of Patrick's mutilated body. \nJUST THEN PATRICK TURNS HIS HEAD AND LOOKS AT MIKE \nPATRICK It's killing your daddy, Mikey. Eating him away. \nMIKE Shut up. \nPATRICK A worm inside a rotten apple. We're all apples, Mikey. All of us. You know the thing about apples -- \nMIKE Stop it. \nPatrick's expression turns into a horrific, fearful murmur. \nPATRICK -- they float. \nMIKE No! \nTHE WALLS START TO SLIDE IN. As if the room were shrinking. The walls shepherding him towards Patrick's talking corpse. \nMike reaches behind him, scraping at the walls, looking for anything with purchase. His hands find the FIRE ALARM. Pulls it. \nThis time the alarm SOUNDS and the strobe lights freeze, the room now fully lit. \nMike looks back, calipers raised, and sees the locker doors closed again, no water on the floor. \nThe door opens behind him. It's the CORONER, Chief Borton, and PATRICK'S PARENTS there to identify the remains of their boy. \nMike is nearly catatonic.   He holds onto the Chief, catching his breath. \nCHIEF BORTON What are you doing here, son? \nSpeechless and terrified Mike races past them out of the hospital. \nEXT. OLD CAPE STREET - NIGHT \nMike walks home, distraught, mindless to the traffic. He is nearly hit by a car as he storms away from the hospital. \nA Trans Am turns a corner behind him.   Headlights on high- beam. It stops. \nMike turns, sees, realizes who it is, runs. \nINT. TRANS AM - SAME \nTravis climbs out of the passenger seat and over to the driver seat. \nTRAVIS Move. \nVictor gets out and runs around the car. \nSNATCH Hey, ain't that the little shit your dad gave you a whoopin' over? \nFurious, Travis slams on the gas pedal.    POV of CAR, giving chase to Mike. \nTRAVIS I'm gonna run him over. \n", "test1_true": "Mike runs for his life, jumping fences, turning corners, and running through pedestrians. \nTravis' Trans-Am can't always speed, due to the amount of people on the street. \nJust when he's about to get within biting distance, BOOM. \nThe first of a long series of FIRE-WORKS, explodes over the Derry sky, illuminating the street in a series of FLASHES. \nEXT. BEN'S HOUSE, ROOFTOP - NIGHT \nWill, Richie, Stan, and Eddie have gathered on Ben's roof to watch the fireworks. \nBOOM. The boys \"oooh\" and \"aaaah\" while stuffing their faces with an unholy array of massed snacks meant to rot teeth and discolor the fingers with multi-colored MSG filled flavor powders. \nRichie, with sticky fingers, picks up a walkie-talkie. \nRICHIE Benny-boy, don't forget the ranch dressing. \nThe walkie-talkie SQWUAKS back. \nBEN Hey Richie. Eat a bag of dicks. \nBOOM. Again, the sky erupts in dazzling light and color AND CONTINUES TO with fireworks THROUGHOUT AND UNTIL THE END OF THE FOLLOWING SCENES -- IMAGINE IT AS THE MOST EPIC FIREWORKS DISPLAY YOU HAVE EVER SEEN. \nBeverly, then Ben, appear from one of the dormer windows leading to Ben's bedroom, with sparklers, bunches of bottle rockets, roman candles and small firecrackers. \nRICHIE (mimicking Paul Hogan) You call that a firecracker?    This is a firecracker. \nHe opens his palms, revealing SEVERAL M-80s.     The boys collectively `woah' with excitement. \nBEVERLY Nice stick, Richie.     How about this. \nShe opens her backpack, revealing a MORTAR with SIX turrets. \nALL THE BOYS Holy shit! \nWILL Think that could take \"IT\" down? \nSTAN                             EDDIE How? We don't even know what      That's a good name for it it is that we're looking for.     actually. \nRICHIE What? \nEDDIE \"IT.\" \nThey nod in agreement. \nBEVERLY I think it depends. \nBeverly looks up from a SPREAD OF FIREWORKS laid out on a red white and blue Captain America towel. \nEDDIE On what? \nWILL What we're scared of. It was Georgie's corpse for me cuz, cuz that's what I care about. It was a naked woman for Stan because he's so afraid of- \nRICHIE Getting laiiiid. \nSTAN                           RICHIE Only because your Mom-          You really want me to start talking about your Mom? Don't get me started cause it won't stop. \nWILL Back to point. It showered Beverly in blood cuz... \nRICHIE Cuz blood always freaks a girl out. \nBEVERLY Wow, you really don't know shit about girls do you? \nWill smiles. \nBEVERLY (CONT'D) \"IT\" showered me in blood because I just got my period... and... \nEddie recoils in disgust while Beverly's mind goes to dark places, to her father, and what being a \"woman\" might mean to him now. Ben and Will both notice this change in her demeanor. \nRICHIE I didn't need to know that. \nWILL It. It's everything and anything. All our nightmares. All evil, wrapped into one. \nBEN Into one freaky looking clown you mean. That's the only form that seems to repeat. \nRICHIE Ironic right? Something that's suppose to make kids laugh, actually being super freaky. \nHe does it Rick James style. Everyone laughs. \nEDDIE It makes sense though. If it's killing kids. A clown is the perfect cover. \nBEVERLY Adults just ignore them. But kids, like your brother, Georgie... \nWILL They want to get closer.   See their tricks. \nJust then Will sees MIKE running for his life down the street. \nWILL (CONT'D) Shit. Isn't that- \nRICHIE Home school. \nThey look where he's running from and see Bowers Gang, in the Trans-Am delayed by foot traffic. \nEDDIE They're going to cream him. \nSTAN At least it won't be our problem for a night. \nBEVERLY That's cowardly, Stan. \nBEN Beverly's right. We can't always hide from them. We need to do something. \n", "test1_id": 1017, "test2_input": "INT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, BASEMENT \nThe kids can see Travis staring straight at them through the window, the 2x4 is non-existent, as if Pennywise is preventing the boys outside from seeing in or entering. \nSTAN They can't see the window? \nEDDIE (STILL REPEATING) We shouldn't be here. \nRICHIE Don't count your chickens. \nMIKE Something wrong with your friend here? \nEDDIE We shouldn't be here! \nWILL                             RICHIE Eddie?                             He's afraid of dirt. \nWill covers Eddie's mouth as he continues to yell, \"we shouldn't be here.\" They watch anxiously as Travis and the boys feet inch uncomfortably closer to them. \nThen Eddie suddenly stops. \nEXT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE - SAME \nFrustrated, Travis and the boys leave. \nINT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, BASEMENT \nThe kids have surrounded Eddie. \nBEVERLY What is it Eddie? \nEDDIE There's something I didn't tell you guys. \nWILL What? \nEDDIE This house. I saw something here once. I thought it was just my mind playing tricks, but now I know... \nThey sense what he is about to say isn't going to be good. \nEDDIE (CONT'D) I saw \"IT.\" \nEddie nods. \nSTAN Jesus. \nRICHIE (TO STAN) Why do you keep using our teams, guy? \nSTAN Wha? \nMIKE What does he mean by \"IT?\" \nWill looks to the gang, they all nod.     He turns back to their newest member. \nWILL Something's wrong with Derry. Haunting it. Hunting and killing kids. We've all seen it. \nMike looks at them all, judging their earnestness. Feels he can trust them, an instant connection with people whose fear clings to your own. \nMIKE I know.   I've seen \"IT\" too. \nJust then, the house seems to shiver. As if its foundation had shifted. A CLANKING SOUND resonates from the pipes. Water BEGINS TO SEEP in through the cracks in the basement. \nBEVERLY What exactly did you see here, Eddie? \nBen goes to the window they came through, but instead of seeing out, it's now covered by the 2x4. \nBEN Guys, uh-- \nHe looks at their feet. They all do. Water coming in fast. Ben bangs a coal stoker against the boarded window. Rock solid. Will looks for a way out. The stairs. \nWILL Stairs. \nSuddenly they HEAR FOOTSTEPS, above. They look up as dust falls from one side of the roof, slowly making its way to directly over them. To the stairs. \nEDDIE (whispering in fright) It's here. \nWill grabs on to Beverly's hand. She holds onto his with equal vigor. Richie holds onto Eddie. \nBen holds the stoker like a sword.     Mike grabs a shovel. They lead the way up the stairs. \nUnless otherwise noted, they ONLY WHISPER now. \nRICHIE I'm not going up there. \nThe others ignore him, follow Ben and Mike up the stairs. \nRichie looks around him at the scary basement, the furnace hulking in the corner like a being with eyes. The water surrounds his shoes. He runs up after his friends. \nINT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 1ST FLOOR \nA door opens in the middle of the kind of creepy hallway you don't want to find yourself in, ever. Scummy yellow water stained wallpaper peeling like dead skin from walls. Sconces hanging from their sockets and detritus is built up on the wooden floor boards. No footprints anywhere. \nBen sticks his head out. He looks left, nothing, he looks right, nothing. Directly in front of him, through a dark parlor, is the FRONT DOOR. \nAs Ben disappears into the stairs again, the door closes, revealing PENNYWISE THE CLOWN, at the far end of the hallway. \nINT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, BASEMENT STAIRS \nBen still has his hand on the door knob. \nBEN The front door is right there. \nWill nods.    Let's go. \nINT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 1ST FLOOR \n", "test2_true": "The kids all file out, sticking close to the filthy walls. They dart into the dark parlor for the door, followed last by Richie... \nThe room seems to extend and last longer than anticipated. Finally they get to the door. Ben tries it. Nailed shut. \nEDDIE Shit. Guys, look. \nEveryone turns and sees HUNDREDS OF CROWS perched atop the railing of the main staircase and in the rafters above. \nMIKE There must be a window open. \nWill reads his mind, an upstairs window might be their only chance to freedom. \nWILL C'mon. \nWill leads the way upstairs. \nINT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 2ND FLOOR \nThe children, petrified, slide up the stairs as silently as possible, trying not to disturb the watching crows. Or alert whatever else is there. The stairs creak and snap loudly. \nThey get to a 2nd floor hallway, the wind from an open window blowing trash around. Will looks around... \nINT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 2ND FLOOR BEDROOM \nHe beckons them into a bedroom with AN OPEN WINDOW. They step over a moldy bare mattress shoved against the wall. \nBeverly is the first one out the window, then Stan, then Richie, then Ben. Ben looks back and sees Eddie standing by the doorway to the hallway. \nBEN Eddie, what are you doing? \nEddie turns towards them, realizes he must have lost consciousness for a second, doesn't understand why he was standing there. He walks towards the window when \nTHE FLOOR GIVES WAY and he tumbles down to the first floor. \nINT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 1ST FLOOR, KITCHEN \nIf the house weren't spooky enough, this room is the spookiest. A bunch of furniture is gathered in the middle of the room covered in sheets. A dusty old refrigerator stands in the corner. Dust everywhere begins to clear from Eddie's fall. He is knocked out. His arm is clearly broken. \nINT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 2ND FLOOR \nWill, Mike, and Ben rush back into the house. \nWILL Eddie! \nWill runs around the gaping hole in the floor and tries to run down the stairs when... \nTHE FLOCK OF CROWS ATTACK \nWill covers his eyes as the birds prevent him from going down. Mike and Ben shore themselves behind him. \nEXT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 2ND FLOOR BEDROOM \nThe other kids scream from the window. \nBEVERLY What's happening?! \nRICHIE Whatever it is, we don't want to go back in there. \nBEVERLY We have to do something. \nShe looks around. \nBEVERLY (CONT'D) Follow me! \nBeverly leads Richie and Stan down to the edge of the roof. \nINT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 2ND FLOOR \nWill, Mike, and Ben are being pelted by the birds still. They retreat back into the bedroom and shut the door. \nINT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 1ST FLOOR, KITCHEN \nEddie, coming back to consciousness, looks around the room. He moans in pain. \nEDDIE Guys? \nFrom the hole above, Will and Ben appear. \nWILL Eddie. \nRealizing he is alone. \nEDDIE Get me out of here. \nWILL We tried, we can't get down stairs. \nEDDIE What do you mean you can't get down stairs? \nEddie looks around the creepy room at the sheets.   Something horrible could be under any one of them. \nWILL Do you see anything you could use to climb out? \nEDDIE I- I think I broke my arm. \nHe holds it up and the lower part of his arm hangs irregularly. Behind him the old refrigerator SHAKES, SOMETHING INSIDE. \nEXT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 2ND FLOOR BEDROOM - NIGHT \nIt's 15 feet sheer drop above the dilapidated pier.    Richie is too scared to jump. \nBEVERLY I don't know, Richie. \n", "test2_id": 1018, "test3_input": "DR. HANDOR Mother knows best. Is that it? \nEddie shrugs. \nDr. Handor smiles, considering his next thought. He leans in, too close for comfort for Eddie. For a moment it's creepy. \nDR. HANDOR (CONT'D) Eddie, do you know what a placebo is? \nEXT. TRAVIS BOWER'S BACKYARD - DAY \nA bottle of Southern Comfort sits on a log. BLAM! \nBowers shoots at it with his dad's police issue .45. Victor and Snatch look on, giggling. \nHe finally tags it, the bottle shattering into a thousand pieces. They all whoop and holler. \nSNATCH Can I try? \nHe reaches for the gun.    Bowers pushes him back. \nTRAVIS Sure. Go put the next target out there. \nTravis points to the cat that's lounging there in the grass. \nSNATCH You're foolin' right? \nTRAVIS Do I look like I'm foolin' numb nuts? \nSnatch grabs the kitty and runs out to the stump. He wipes away the glass and sets the cat down. It starts to meow and tries to get away. \nSNATCH It's not staying. \nBower lines up a shot, sight of the barrel on the cat. \nTRAVIS Hold it there, butt cheese. \nOFFICER BOWERS (O.C.) What the hell is this? \nOfficer Bowers steps from his police cruiser in the driveway. His face as red as fire. \nTRAVIS Nothing, pa. Just cleaning your gun like you asked. \nOFFICER BOWERS Cleaning my gun, huh? \nHe stalks up and grabs the gun from Travis. Smells it. \nWHAP! He smacks Travis hard in the face, knocking the big boy to the grass. \nOFFICER BOWERS (CONT'D) Normally I use a rod and cleaner not bullets and whiskey. (MORE) \nOFFICER BOWERS (CONT'D) You two punks put your sticky little fingers on my firearm here? \nVictor and Snatch are too scared to talk. \nVICTOR N-N-No sir. \nButch turns the gun on Travis at his feet. \nOFFICER BOWERS You're not worth the salt you lick boy. I don't know how I let you squirm your way out your momma's womb. \nTRAVIS Pa, I'm--- \nBLAM! \nHe shoots the ground around     Travis feet. Travis squeals like a girl, utterly terrified.      BLAM! BLAM! A large wet stain spreads around his crotch.      Butch Bowers raises the pistol, as if he were about to whip     Travis, who falls to the ground. \nButch shakes his head. \nOFFICER BOWERS (to the boys) Look at him now boys. Nothing like a little fear to make a paper man crumble. (TO TRAVIS) Clean your drawers `fore you come inside. \nHe spits out his disgust, stalks inside. \nVictor and Snatch tip-toe over to Travis, not knowing what to say or do. Travis does everything he can not to cry. \nVICTOR You okay, Travis? \nAn odd wind stirs through the grass there, a yellow menacing gathering of clouds overhead. Travis suddenly notices... \nA BALLOON, bobbing over his mailbox, string connected to something stuffed inside. \nTravis pushes past his two cronies and goes over to the mailbox. Inside he pulls out THE KNIFE. The one he lost at the beginning. And attached to the string a note: \nTO:     MR. TRAVIS BOWERS FROM:   MR. ROBERT GRAY \nA murderous look screws onto Travis' face as he turns his attention to his house. And his pa inside. \nHe snaps the string and starts toward the front door with the knife. The balloon floats up into the darkening sky. \nINT. CORONER'S OFFICE - DAY \nA THUNDERCLAP outside. The coroner steps out the door. Will and Mike slip in behind him, Will propping open the door with his Walkie. \nMIKE Patrick was in one of the lockers. All the water bubbled up from there. \nThe drain. Will goes to it. Gazes down into the blackness. \nWILL The sewers. \nMIKE What? \nWILL \"IT.\" Whenever it shows up, there's always water around. The storm drain where Georgie died. The leak in my room. Beverly's sink. \nMIKE My dad saw it near water, too.      The canal. \n", "test3_true": "MIKE Unless you live way out in the sticks like I do. We have to tell the others. \nWill realizes something. \nWILL Shit, Stan's bar mitzvah.   I almost forgot. \nMIKE I wasn't invited. \nWill hands him his invite. \nWILL You are now. Let's go! \nA pair of YELLOW EYES glow from the drain. \nINT. BEVERLY'S APARTMENT - DAY \nBeverly, all gussied up in a pretty white dress, heads for the door. A hand snatches out from behind and seizes her arm. \nMR. MARSH Where you think you going girl? \nBEVERLY My friend's party. I told ma-- \nMR. MARSH You're all prettied up. Who you all prettied up for? \nBEVERLY No one. \nHe shoves her against the wall, eyes her little body up and down. Caresses her hair. \nMR. MARSH Don't lie to me, Bevvie. You know how I worry about you. I worry a lot. \nBEVERLY I know daddy. \nMR. MARSH People in town seen you. Got to sayin' things. Like how my little girl been sneakin' around all summer long with a pack of boys. Only girl to the pack. \nBEVERLY They're my friends, daddy. \nHe squeezes her cheeks with one hand, holding her head in place. \nMR. MARSH You sure about that, Bevvie? \nBEVERLY I-- I swear. They're just friends. \nMR. MARSH Friends? I know what's in them boys minds when they look at you, Bevvie. I know all too well. They want to do bad things. Did you let them do bad things to you? \nHe looms over her. Something in his manner is detached. Like he's there but isn't there. \nBEVERLY I'm a good girl daddy. Good, just like you raised me. \nMR. MARSH Is that so? Then what's this? \nHe pulls out Ben's Haiku Poem. \nBEVERLY WHERE'D YOU-- \nMR. MARSH You had it squirreled away in your underwear drawer. Why would you want to hide it with your underwear Bevvie? What else are you holdin' out from me. \nBEVERLY It's nothing, daddy.   Just a poem. \nMR. MARSH (RECITING) Your hair is winter fire, JANUARY EMBERS My heart burns there, too \nHe grabs her by the hair and pulls her up to him. \nMR. MARSH (CONT'D) Sounds lusty to me. Who wrote it. Which one of your boyfriends? \nBEVERLY I told you I don't have one. \nMR. MARSH Don't lie to me! \nHe drags her down the hall by the hair. \nBEVERLY Daddy stop. You're hurting me. \nMR. MARSH You're ma says you're a woman now. You bled. What other womanly things you been doing down in the deep dark woods with those boys, Bevvie. \nHe throws her into his bedroom. \nBEVERLY Nothing. Please, daddy. You don't have to worry. I promise. Please! \nMR. MARSH Let's see then. Prove to me you been good. \nShe doesn't know what he means. \nMR. MARSH (CONT'D) Take off your tights. \nBEVERLY What? \nMR. MARSH I love you Bevvie. You're special. You're such a pretty girl. But there's plenty of boys happy to roon a pretty girl. Plenty of pretty girls willing to be roont. I need to know if you're intact. \nHe unbuckles his belt, but he doesn't look at her like he wants to whip her, there's another hunger in his eyes. \nMR. MARSH (CONT'D) Your tights, girl. Take `em off. \nBEVERLY Daddy, please. \nHe slides off his belt and grabs her, smiling, a smile that feels all too reminiscent of a clown. \nMR. MARSH You'll like it, Bevvie.   Be like you're floating. \nBev kicks him in the balls. Her father lets go, crumpling down. She knees him in the face as hard as she can, his head flying back into the side of the door. \nBeverly tries to race out the door but he snatches her ankle and she trips into the hallway. By the time she is up he is lunging towards her. \n", "test3_id": 1019}

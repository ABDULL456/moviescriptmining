THROUGH THE LENS: the gash spreads easily, soft, bloodless. 
ICHABOD No clotting or gathering of pus.  No healing at all. 
DOCTOR LANCASTER What? 
ICHABOD When this cut was made, this person was already dead. (stands straight) This is not Lady Van Tassel. 
INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT 
Young Masbath enters.  The door swings shut. 
YOUNG MASBATH Katrina. (steps forward) Is anyone here? 
Behind him, the door SLAMS open -- Lady Van Tassel reaches to grab Young Masbath by the throat. 
EXT.  CHURCH/TOWN SQUARE -- NIGHT 
Ichabod charges up to the church doors, pounding. 
ICHABOD Open the door.  Open up, damn it! (pounds, shouting) Lady van Tassel is alive.  The Horseman is her puppet.  Please... 
The door opens and Huge Farmer points a rifle at Ichabod. Frightened people peer out from behind. 
HUGE FARMER Aren't we rid of you? 
ICHABOD Listen to me.  Lady Van Tassel has faked her death.  I need able men... 
HUGE FARMER She's dead, and you have gone mad. 
ICHABOD No... 
HUGE FARMER (steps forward) Get out!  Isn't it enough that you have ruined this town?  Go! 
Ichabod backs away from the gun, frustrated, runs... 
At the DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, Van Ripper is still on the coach. Ichabod sprints over, breathless, taking out his pistol. 
ICHABOD Van Ripper... do you have a gun? 
VAN RIPPER Yes.  Here... 
Van Ripper hold up a rifle.  Ichabod holds out his hand. 
ICHABOD May I see it? 
Van Ripper's confused, but hands the rifle over.  Ichabod immediately points his pistol at Van Ripper. 
ICHABOD Get down.  Hurry! 
Van Ripper climbs off.  Ichabod climbs up, whips the horses. 
ICHABOD Sorry. 
Van Ripper watches the coach leave, still with his hands up. 
EXT.  FOREST -- NIGHT 
In a wooded area, Katrina lies unconscious.  Gloved hands reach to her hair and cut off a clump with SCISSORS. 
A conjuring pile has been made, containing a small animal's heart with an iron nail through it.  Katrina's hair is added and the pile is lit to burn. 
Nearby, Young Masbath watches, on his belly with his hands tied behind his back. 
Lady Van Tassel whispers over the fire, her white horse tied nearby.  She looks to Katrina, who stirs. 
Lady Van Tassel takes the Horseman's skull from a bag over her shoulder, places the skull in the flames.  THUNDER is HEARD.  Lady Van Tassel looks up, smiles. 
EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- NIGHT 
The wind tosses leaves in swirls.  The twisted tree opens wide, with a RUMBLE -- shafts of light shooting out. 
EXT.  THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- NIGHT 
Ichabod drives the coach hard ahead. 
EXT.  FOREST -- NIGHT 
Katrina sits up, groggy.  Lady Van Tassel looks down at her. 
KATRINA You... you are alive. 
LADY VAN TASSEL Am I?  Or, are you and Young Masbath dead along with me? 
Katrina sees Young Masbath, and beyond him, the dying fire. 
YOUNG MASBATH She commands the Horseman. 
LADY VAN TASSEL And, quite beautifully done, wouldn't you say?  It is almost over. 
THUNDER again.  Wind starts to pick up. 
LADY VAN TASSEL (of the wind) He rides tonight. 
KATRINA Father saw you die. 
LADY VAN TASSEL He saw me thrown... saw the Horseman looming over me as I fled.  Things I wanted him to see.  But, as long as I govern the Horseman, he cannot harm me.  Baltus did not stay enough to see that.  He ran as a coward, unfettered by my fate. 
YOUNG MASBATH Then, whose body was it... ? 
LADY VAN TASSEL The precious servant girl Sarah.  I killed her and kept her body hidden, till I needed it.  And, when I return to the Hollow tomorrow, my version of the truth will come to pass. (faking meekness) I mean, there I was that fateful day, following Baltus into the woods.  I did not know what he was up to... where he was going.  I worried for his safety.

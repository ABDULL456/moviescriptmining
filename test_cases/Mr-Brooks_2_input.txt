DETECTIVE ATWOOD This is my case, what you're doing is fucked. But since I can't stop you, and she won't, here's a tip. James Baffert, you should stake him out, he knows something. 
DETECTIVE LONGNECKER We have some other ideas we are looking into. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Then what's the problem? You do that and I'll tail Baffert. 
DETECTIVE LONGNECKER Thank you for all your good work, Detective. This is our case now. 
Atwood looks from one Man to the Other. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Good luck. (to Captain Lister) Later I suppose you'll fill me in on what I'm supposed to be doing around here. I'm confused. 
She leaves. Snyder closes the door behind her. 
INT. RECEPTION AREA - BROOKS BOX FACTORY - LATE EVENING 
It's deserted with only a small spill of light coming from Mr. Brooks' Office. 
INSIDE 
Mr. Brooks is at his desk. 
The lamp at his elbow throws a yellow cone across his face. His head is in his hands, he's been crying. 
Marshall steps out of the shadows behind him. 
MARSHALL It's time to go. 
MR. BROOKS Yeah. 
He reaches into a bottom drawer and as he takes out an envelope, Marshall reads the tear-stained hand written letter resting on the blotter. 
MARSHALL Dear Emma and Jane, my loves, I have a terminal illness and instead of subjecting you to my deterioration, I have decided to disappear. Don't try to find me, I don't want to be found. Please believe that the time I spent with you brought me the greatest joy of my life. Love. Dad. 
Mr. Brooks picks up the letter and folds it. 
MARSHALL So you're going to go through with it. 
Mr. Brooks stuffs the letter in the envelope, seals it and picks up a pen. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MR. BROOKS It's all planned to work out, Marshall. 
On the envelope he writes: For EMMA and JANE. 
EXT. STREET Ñ NIGHT 
On the sidewalk Mr. Smith is walking toward the on-coming traffic. The headlights make it difficult to tell one car from the other until they pass. That doesn't keep him from looking for Mr. Brooks. 
The houses stop and he's passing a pocket park. In a dark space between the street lamps, a hand falls on Mr. Smith's shoulder. He jumps and a scream squeaks out of his throat. It's Mr. Brooks, in his Pottery-Throwing clothes. 
MR. BROOKS (smiles) Are you ready to rock and roll, Mr. Smith? 
Mr. Smith swallows hard and nods. Mr. Brooks propels him into the park. 
INT. MR. BROOKS' CAR Ñ NIGHT 
Mr. Brooks is driving. Mr. Smith is in the passenger seat. Both are lost in a wary silence. Abruptly from the back seat: 
MARSHALL I smell gun oil, a gun oil that's different than yours. 
MR. BROOKS He brought his gun. After he gets what he wants he plans to kill me. 
MARSHALL Ah... now I get it. You were counting on that, weren't you? 
MR. BROOKS It has a certain logic. 
MARSHALL But if your plan is to have him kill you, why do you have to kill someone else first? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MR. BROOKS He'll need to see that to get up the courage to kill me. 
Marshall roars with laughter. 
MARSHALL Not even you believe that, Earl. It makes it more exciting, doesn't it, to think he's going to kill you after you kill someone else. You're getting your rocks off big time, that's why you're doing it. 
MR. BROOKS Not true... and if it were, so what? (to Mr. Smith) You're goddamn great, you know. To have the balls to do this. 
MR. SMITH I'm pretty nervous but that's normal right? 
MR. BROOKS Perfectly normal. 
INT. DETECTIVE ATWOOD'S CONDOMINIUM Ñ NIGHT 
Atwood is propped up in bed reading a Magazine. Her hair is pulled back and her face glistens with Cold Cream. 
The phone rings. Should she answer it? It rings again, then again. Reluctantly she grabs the receiver. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Hello... Oh, yes, yes. (she sits up) Put him through... Hi, this is Detective Atwood speaking, thanks for calling...Yes, your roommate said you were in Tokyo... Anything, if you saw anything at all it might be helpful.

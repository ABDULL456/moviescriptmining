LEIA Why, I guess you don't know everything about women yet? 
With that she leans over and kisses Luke on the lips.  Then she turns on her heel and walks out, leaving everyone in the room slightly dumbstruck.  With some smugness, Luke puts his hands behind his head and grins. 
Suddenly, in the distance, the muffled sound of an alarm is heard. 
ANNOUNCER (over loudspeaker) Headquarters personnel, report to command center. 
The voice repeats the order and Han, Chewie, Artoo, and Threepio hurry out of the room, bidding farewell to Luke. 
HAN Take it easy. 
THREEPIO Excuse us, please. 
INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER 
Rieekan looks up grimly from a console screen.  He calls over to Leia and Han. 
RIEEKAN Princess... we have a visitor. 
The group hurries over to Rieekan. 
RIEEKAN We've picked up something outside the base in zone twelve, moving east. 
SENIOR CONTROLLER It's metal. 
LEIA Then it couldn't be one of those creatures that attacked Luke. 
HAN It could be a speeder, one of ours. 
SENIOR CONTROLLER No.  Wait - there's something very weak coming through. 
Threepio steps up to the control panel and listens intently to the strange signal. 
THREEPIO Sir, I am fluent in six million forms of communication.  This signal is not used by the Alliance.  It could be an Imperial code. 
The transmission ends in static. 
HAN It isn't friendly, whatever it is. Come on, Chewie, let's check it out. 
RIEEKAN Send Rogues Ten and Eleven to station three-eight. 
EXT. HOTH - SNOW PLAIN - DAY 
The dark probe robot moves past the smoldering ruins of station three- eight and down a ridge toward the Rebel base.  It raises a large antenna from the top of its head and begins to send out a piercing signal. 
The probe droid has spotted Chewbacca who, not thirty feet away, has popped his head over a snow bank.  Instantly, the probe robot swings around, its deadly ray ready to fire.  But before it can get a shot off, it is hit from behind by a laser bolt, and explodes in a million pieces. 
Han Solo replaces his blaster in its holster and peers intently at the smoldering remains of the Imperial probe. 
INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER 
Leia and Rieekan listen to Han on the comlink. 
HAN (over comlink) Afraid there's not much left. 
LEIA (into comlink) What was it? 
HAN (over comlink) Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit it that hard.  It must have had a self-destruct. 
LEIA (into comlink) An Imperial probe droid. 
HAN (over comlink) It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here. 
RIEEKAN We'd better start the evacuation. 
EXT. SPACE - IMPERIAL FLEET 
Darth Vader's Star Destroyer, larger and more awesome than the five Imperial Star Destroyers that surround it, sits in the vastness of space.  The six huge ships are surrounded by a convoy of smaller spacecraft.  TIE fighters dart to and fro. 
INT. DARTH VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE - MAIN CONTROL DECK 
Controllers working the vast complex of electronic controls hear ominous approaching footsteps and look up from their controls.  The squat, evil-looking Admiral Ozzel and the young, powerfully built General Veers, who have been conferring near the front, also feel the approaching presence and turn toward it.  Darth Vader, Lord of the Sith, enters like a chill wind.  As Vader moves across the wide bridge, Captain Piett hurries up to Ozzel. 
PIETT Admiral. 
OZZEL Yes, Captain 
PIETT I think we've got something, sir. The report is only a fragment from a probe droid in the Hoth system, but it's the best lead we've had. 
OZZEL (irritated) We have thousands of probe droids searching the galaxy.  I want proof, not leads! 
PIETT The visuals indicate life readings. 
OZZEL It could mean anything.  If we followed every lead... 
PIETT But, sir, the Hoth system is supposed to be devoid of human forms.

CUT TO: 
INT. THE BRIG - DAY 
A HOLDING ROOM where DAWSON and DOWNEY are being put through their paces. 
JO And what happened after Kendrick came into your room? 
DOWNEY (beat) He ordered me and Corporal Dawson to give Willy a Code Red. 
SAM (to Jo) His answers still have to come faster, Jo. The Iowa farmboy thing'll play for a while, but in the end it looks like he's searching for the truth. 
KAFFEE (to Dawson & Downey) He's right, and from now on, "Willy" is Private Santiago. You start calling him Willy and all of a sudden he's a person who's got a mother who's gonna miss him. 
CUT TO: 
INT. THE APARTMENT - NIGHT 
MOS -- The clock reads 3:37, and KAFFEE, in sweatpants and a bathrobe, is pacing around slowly with his baseball bat and 
CUT TO: 
SAM and JO art listening to a lecture for the 14th time. 
KAFFEE Poker faces. Don't flinch in front of the jury. Something doesn't go our way, don't hang your head, don't shift in your seat, don't scribble furiously. Whatever happens, you have to look like it's exactly what you knew was gonna happen. When you pass me documents -- 
JO/SAM Do it swiftly, but don't look overanxious. 
KAFFEE (beat) And don't wear that perfume in Court, it wrecks my concentration. 
JO Really! 
KAFFEE I was talking to Sam. 
SAM What time is it? 
KAFFEE Time to go home. Try to get some sleep tonight. 
JO (to SAM) I'll give you a ride. 
SAM begins to gather up his things. He stands in front of KAFFEE. 
KAFFEE (to SAM) You're a good man, Charlie Brown. 
SAM See you in court. 
Sam steps out the door. JO looks at the ground, then up at KAFFEE. 
JO Danny -- 
KAFFEE I know what you're gonna say. You don't have to. We've had our differences. I've said some things I didn't mean, you've said some things you didn't means but you're happy that I stuck with the case. And if you've gained a certain respect for me over the last three weeks that you didn't have before, well, of course I'm happy about that, but we don't have to make a whole big deal out of it. You like me. I won't make you say it. 
JO I was just gonna tell you to wear matching socks tomorrow. 
KAFFEE (beat) Oh. (beat) Okay. Good tip. 
JO We're ready. 
KAFFEE Bet your ass. 
Jo walks out the door and KAFFEE closes it and locks it behind her. 
Then he says, very softly... 
KAFFEE (continuing) We're gonna get creamed. 
CUT TO: 
INT. THE COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY 
A few M.P.Is are standing by the entrance. KAFFEE comes around the corner and heads toward the courtroom. We're immediately stricken by something: 
In his dress blue uniform he could easily be mistaken for a real live naval officer. He opens the courtroom doors and walks into 
INT. THE COURTROOM - DAY 
A few more M.P.'s are standing around. THE JURORS, nine enlisted navy and marine men and women, are in their place, Ross is at his table looking through some papers, and DAWSON and DOWNEY, in handcuffs, are seated at the defense table. The trial in a few moments from being underway and a few people are milling about. KAFFEE walks down the aisle but is stopped by a voice behind him. 
MAN (O.S.) Lieutenant Kaffee? 
KAFFEE turns around to see a MAN and WOMAN who are clearly Dawson's parents. 
MAN You're gonna save our son, aren't you? 
KAFFEE (pause) I'll do my best. 
KAFFEE continues on and stops next to JO, who's talking with a WOMAN in her mid-30's. 
JO Danny, I want you to meet Ginny Miller, Louden's aunt. 
KAFFEE You're Aunt Ginny? 
GINNY Uh-huh. 
KAFFEE I'm sorry, I was expecting someone older. 
GINNY So was I. 
Not quite the words of inspiration KAFFEE was hoping to hear before he does the hardest thing he's ever had to do. 
He walks over to ROSS. 
KAFFEE Last chance. I'll flip you for it.

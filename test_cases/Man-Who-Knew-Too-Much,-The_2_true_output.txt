Ban stands in the doorway. He instantly rushes toward Hank, the CAMERA PANNING him. Hank leaps to his feet, and the two of them come together.

Ben turns quickly to look.

For a moment the group stands there in silence.    Then Ben speaks. 
BEN I don't think you want to start any shooting, Drayton -- with all those people downstairs, and police outside. 
Drayton looks at him without saying anything, but the gun doesn't lower. 
Mrs. Drayton addresses her husband fiercely. 
MRS. DRAYTON You've got to let the boy go!

DRAYTON Precisely my own notion, my dear. 
He moves forward on   the group, gun poised. Hank clutches his father   in fright, and Ben tenses himself, prepared for battle   if necessary. Mrs. Drayton stares at her husband with   some defiance. Drayton addresses Ben amiably. 
DRAYTON I'm sure you'll ba sensible, and help me out of here? 
BEN Don't ask me for help, you miserable....

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
Drayton's intentions are unmistakable. Ben looks down at him with a hatred that is almost ready to explode, but he has sense enough to understand Drayton's meaning. Drayton straightens up, a slight smile on his face. He slips the gun into his pocket, but still holds it. 
DRAYTON We'll go down the stairs   together in a casual sort of way. Then    we'll stroll along to the nearest taxi   rank. I trust there won't be any   emotional outbursts... 
BEN (Interrupting) There won't be. Hank -- don't say or do anything. 
Hank just nods.   He's too frightened to talk. 
DRAYTON Shall we go? 
Ben starts for the door with Hank, and Drayton moves into the other side of Hank. As they go through the door, Mrs. Drayton makes an instinctive step forward, if to attack Drayton from the rear, but the sight of Hank in danger stops her.

The music coming from the ballroom ceases, as Jo finishes her second song. There is the sound of great applause. The three are about a dozen steps from the bottom, when suddenly Ben shoots out a hard and pushes Drayton forward. Taken by surprise, he stumbles, and falls down the stairs clumsily. Clutching for support with his hands, the gun goes off in his pocket, and he remains in a crumpled heap at the bottom of the stairs.

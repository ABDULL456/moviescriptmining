Laura in her office. HIGH MODERNITY. She works through her files. Opening one with Raya's photo on top. She dials. 
INTERCUT WITH: 
74   INT. RAYA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                  74 
The phone is ringing. Halyna rushes to it. Out of breath... 
HALYNA (UKRAINIAN) Hello? 
LAURA LEVIN (RUSSIAN) Mrs. Kochan, I'm calling from the Global Displacement Agency in Sarajevo to confirm you have a daughter named Rayisa? TWB 39. 
HALYNA (RUSSIAN) (Straightening) Yes. Yes! 
LAURA LEVIN We have located her... 
Halyna falls into a chair, her chest heaving relief. 
75   EXT. FLORIDA BAR - NIGHT                                       75 
Kathy pulls up to a PARKING LOT full of CARS and UN SUVs. MUSIC spills out. BACK IN BUSINESS. She gets out of the SUV, moving inside... 
76   INT. FLORIDA BAR - CONTINUOUS                                  76 
Kathy in the doorway. The place is dark but lit by lamps along the walls. MUSIC pumps. The place is hopping. A scantily-clad GIRL dances on the stage, her body writhing but her eyes dead. Along the edges, girls - the very SAME GIRLS Kathy saw released at the raid - 'socialize' with customers. 
Many of the CUSTOMERS... in IPTF UNIFORMS, others with off- duty IPTF SWEATSHIRTS, and INTERNATIONALS in civilian casuals. A few LOCALS at the bar, where... 
Tanjo commands the scene, cheery, chatting with an IPTF OFFICER at the bar. 
Kathy stands, frozen , until she catches the eye of... 
Luba, sitting on the knee of a MIDDLE-AGED IPTF Officer. Kathy is filled with... anger. 
77   INT./EXT. UN SUV - SHORT TIME LATER                            77 
Kathy SPEEDS up the mountain roads. Past many bars. One after another, after another... All filled with UN SUVs. Groups of drunk OFFICERS spill out. She stops across from one, seeing: 
Jan coming out of the bar. Kathy watches, stunned... 
Jan helps a drunk friend pile into an SUV. He looks up and sees Kathy as a car beam slides over her. She pulls away. 
78   INT. KATHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                 78 
Kathy stands on the balcony. Taking in the cold air. A KNOCK. 
JAN (O.S.) Kathy, it's Jan. 
KATHY Go home. TWB 40. 
JAN (O.S.) I don't understand. What's wrong? 
Kathy stands, quiet. 
JAN (O.S.) (CONT'D) Let me in. Please. 
Kathy waits a moment, breathing... 
79   INT. KATHY'S APARTMENT - SHORT TIME LATER                      79 
Kathy paces as Jan struggles for words. 
KATHY How can you go up there, when you know what happens to these girls? 
JAN It was a good-bye party. I was-- 
KATHY They're thirteen, fourteen, fifteen-- 
JAN I know. If you let me finish, I got a call. Some friends needed a lift home because they got drunk. But hey lady, you better wake up! EVERYWHERE is a brothel. The coffee shop down the street. The post office. My corner store. That's how it is here. I'm not interested, and I try and stay in clean places. And if you don't believe me, then fuck you. 
He looks at her, hurt - He cares what she thinks. Kathy sees this. Something she hasn't felt in so long... Needed. 
JAN (CONT'D) Are you okay? 
KATHY No... I'm not okay. These girls... What are these guys thinking? 
She looks at him, fighting the urge to trust him. Jan brushes a strand of hair from her face. She lets go. He pulls her in. 
KATHY (CONT'D) Can you tell me what you know? TWB 41. 
80   INT. KATHY'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT                            80 
Jan and Kathy in front of her computer. They're on an IPTF MESSAGE BOARD: Flashes of Various Posts: New Girl at the Berlin Bar; New Twelve Year-Old Pussy at the Old Grill. 
They scroll down dozens of posts. Kathy looks at Jan, shaken by the banal malevolence of a boys club gone wild. 
81   INT. KATHY'S APARMENT - NIGHT                                  81 
Kathy watches Jan, asleep in her bed. 
82   EXT. CENTRAL SARAJEVO - MORNING                                82 
Fog hangs low over the waking valley of Sarajevo. 
83   INT. GDA - MORNING                                             83

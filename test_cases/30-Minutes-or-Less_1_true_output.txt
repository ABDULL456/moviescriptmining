WILL Point taken. Luis, how we doing on the money? 
Chet snaps back to attention - 
CHET Oh, shit. Sorry, Cruz. 
Chet picks out the most harmless looking teller, a mousy 20- something girl, and helps her up off the ground. He checks her name tag: SANDRA. 
CHET Hey, Sandra. I know you're probably scared right now, but if you go grab us 100 grand in a bag, we'll get out of here. This will all be over and you'll be fine. You trust me? 
Sandra nods. Chet smiles, reassuringly. She hurries behind the counter, starts filling a bank bag with cash, as - 
FAT MAN My leg really hurts! 
WILL Can you please hurry up, Sandra!? 
Sandra emerges from behind the partition with the bank bag. Will grabs it. He takes a last look at the people spread across the floor. 
WILL I'm really sorry, everyone. I know we probably fucked up your day. (looks to Fat Man) I'm thinking of you in particular, sir. Actually, you know what... 
Will crosses to the Fat Man, offers the bank bag. 
WILL Quickly. Peel a few bills. On me. Anyone rats him to the cops and I'm coming for you. I remember faces. 
The Fat Man hesitantly reaches for the bag. Opens it - 
Red Dye explodes all over his face. He shrieks. Chet whirls on the teller. 
CHET What the fuck was that about, Sandra? I thought we had something going! What happened to trust? 
SANDRA I'm sorry! They make us do it! 
WILL Could you kindly fill another bag? Not a bank bag. A fucking garbage bag. And Luis, will you watch her this time? 
Sandra hurries back behind the partition with Chet. He dumps out the contents of a trash can, grabs the bag and watches closely as Sandra stuffs it with cash. 
CHET Okay. That should be enough. 
Chet grabs the bag and hustles out toward Will. They are home free, until - 
They hear the wail of approaching sirens outside. They stop cold, panicked. Will whirls on the Tellers. 
WILL Fuck! Which one of you assholes tripped the alarm!? Was it you, Sandra!? 
SANDRA No! It was Mark! He pushed the button when you guys came in! 
Another teller, MARK, looks up from the floor. 
MARK Sandra, you bitch! Now they're gonna kill us both! 
SANDRA Fuck you, Mark! You're the manager! 
Will loses his shit - 
WILL Fuck both of you! Fuck all of you! I'm a regular guy! Just like you! I'm a regular guy and you fucked me! Thank you for fucking a regular guy! 
People are freaked out. Sandra is crying, thinking she will probably get shot now. 
Chet grabs Will and pulls him toward the door. 
CHET Let's just get the fuck out of here. 
The guys slam through the doors, out into 
EXT. PARKING LOT, DONNER-WELLS NATIONAL BANK - DAY 
Just as a lone police cruiser screeches into the lot. Will and Chet make a run for it, but the cruiser cuts them off. 
OFFICER ZURMAN (21), a jittery rookie, jumps out of the cruiser and levels his gun. The guys reflexively level theirs. 
OFFICER ZURMAN Drop your weapons! 
CHET Don't shoot us! 
OFFICER ZURMAN Drop the guns or I'll have to! 
Chet looks at Will with utter desperation. In the distance, they hear the sirens of more cops approaching. Will tosses his gun, rips open his jacket and grabs a cluster of wires. 
WILL Fuck you! You just brought a gun to a bomb fight, officer! I pull these wires out and we all go! You got ten seconds to drop your gun and -

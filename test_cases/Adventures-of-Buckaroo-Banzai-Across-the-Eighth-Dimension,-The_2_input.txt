DOCTOR LIZARDO (to Bigbooté) Kill the girl! 
...Buckaroo losing sight of the swift arachtoid John Bigbooté, resorting instead to his ELECTRONIC TRACKING DEVICE while... 
INT.  FLOODED CORRIDOR - NIGHT	365 
...Reno, New Jersey and Pinky Carruthers bring Apache Team down a flooded corridor, meeting some opposition. 
INT.  DARK CORRIDOR - NIGHT	366 
Buckaroo spotting New Jersey in the confusion, the two of them tracking Penny electronically, descending concrete steps, moving down a dark corridor that we recognize... 
INT.  LAUNCH HANGER - NIGHT	367 
The Secretary of Defense meanwhile reaching the big hangar, confused, alarmed, chaos everywhere, shouting over the din: 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE Bigboote! 
...spotting John Bigbooté across the hangar floor, going after him, staring bug-eyed at the MONSTROUS-LOOKING SPACECRAFT suspended above the hangar floor... 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE What the hell...that ain't no Truncheon bomber, my friend.  I never approved that! 
INT.  CORRIDOR - NIGHT	368 
The Secretary following the speedy John Bigbooté around a bend, unable to keep up... 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE Bigboote! 
Bigbooté giving no indication of seeing him, rounding a corner ducking into his office... 
...the Secretary rounding the corner too but seeing no sign of Bigbooté...instead just an office door, a nameplate reading JOHN BIGBOOTÉ, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT...the Secretary of Defense opening the door... 
INT.  BIGBOOTÉ'S OFFICE - NIGHT	369 
...moving past a vacant receptionist's desk to John Bigbooté's cavernous, strangely furnished chamber...EMPTY. 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE Bigboote?!  You can run, but you can't hide.  I want some facts! 
...but no sign of John Bigbooté. 
INT.  CORRIDOR - NIGHT	370 
Buckaroo and New Jersey still tracking Penny, moving through another flooded, slimy corridor we remember... 
INT.  BIGBOOTÉ'S OFFICE - NIGHT	371 
...the Secretary spying a phone on the receptionist's desk amid scattered Oreo cookies, picking the phone up, clicking it a couple of times to get a dial tone...totally ignoring AN AMAZING FRAMED PICTURE OF A RED ARACHTOID MOTHER AND CHILD ON THE DESK RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM... 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE Operator...operator...how the hell does a person get an outside line around here? 
...his gaze now focusing squarely on that cheap framed photograph of the RED ARACHTOIDS...Secretary McKinley losing his bearings... 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE Oh, Lord.  Never mind...forget it... 
...his mind reeling, refusing to accept the obvious, the oddly designed furniture and chairs in the room, somehow insect-like...a sudden sound...a WOMAN'S SCREAM that seems to come from...underneath the floor? 
...the Secretary cocking his weapon and stepping around the desk as an amazing thing occurs...A TRAPDOOR IN THE OFFICE FLOOR opening, the Secretary going to investigate, able to observe... 
HIS POV of...John O'Connor coming up a ladder and, in the room below, a barely conscious Penny still in her private hell, trussed and taped, ANTS CRAWLING ON HER ARMS...the lurid specter of John Bigbooté staring at her... 
INT.  THE PIT - NIGHT	373 
PENNY'S CLEAR PLASTIC PURSE UNOPENED ON THE DESK BESIDE HER, as the Secretary of Defense suddenly knocks John O'Connor down the ladder and jumps into the room, injuring his ankle... 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE What the hell's is going on here, Bigboote? Where's my bomber? 
JOHN BIGBOOTÉ That's 'Bigbooté'. 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE I don't give a flying handshake what it is! Where's my bomber? 
JOHN BIGBOOTÉ Let's just climb upstairs to my office and discuss this like two reasonable... 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE Your private life's your own concern, pal.  Where the hell is my bomber?  Look at this place...where's your pride?  It's like a pigsty down here! 
THE TELESCOPING ARM of John Bigbooté suddenly shooting out and lifting the Secretary off the floor, banging him into the wall... 
JOHN BIGBOOTÉ It's not my goddamn planet!  Understand, monkey boy!? 
...BIZARRE LAMPS SWAYING as GUNFIRE upstairs prompts Bigbooté to release the Secretary, to urge O'Connor to head for a door off the hallway... 
JOHN O'CONNOR But John Whorfin said kill her.

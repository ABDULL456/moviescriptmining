Archer emerges into the maze of dry-docked boats. Silently checking his clip, he discards the empty gun. 
Castor moves stealthily through the narrow paths. Hearing a NOISE behind him -- 
BOOM!  Castor FIRES -- blowing apart an under-repair hull.  He advances toward the boat, gun ready, when Archer appears behind him and follows -- one step, two steps -- until -- 
Castor stops -- then whirls as Archer leaps. 
The men collapse hard.  Castor's pistol clatters across the yard toward the docked boat. 
Archer and Castor brutally strangle each other -- digging their fingers deep into their throats.  They throttle each other so hard, Archer's larynx vocal chip is dislodged. 
His VOICE CHANGES, ECHOING with garbled.  STATIC. 
ARCHER Give up, Castor.  People are going to find out. 
CASTOR Not if I kill you first. 
They scramble for the gun -- but a hand reaches out from the docked boat and picks it up.  Archer and Castor stop dead in their tracks because -- 
Jamie appears, holding the pistol. 
CASTOR Give it here, Jamie. 
ARCHER No, Jamie.  Don't do it! 
Everybody gawks -- because Archer and Castor are now... 
Both speaking in Archer's true voice.

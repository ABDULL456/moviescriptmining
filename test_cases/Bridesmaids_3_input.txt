INT. PARTY BUS. 
Loud music. Lillian tries to call Annie back. Annie tries to call Lillian back. They both get voice-mails. Annie gives up. It starts pouring rain on her inside the club. Everyone jumps up and screams with excitement. Thunder! 
CLUB D.J. Me Tarzan, you Jane. It's time for the dance spotlight. If it lands on you, you gotta shake it! The spotlight immediately lands on a soaking wet Annie. She dances very angrily. Jungle dancers dance very close to her and put vines around her neck.

DAVE Its ok. Sorry I gave you a hickey.

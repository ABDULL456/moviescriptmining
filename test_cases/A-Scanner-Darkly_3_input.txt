ERNIE LUCKMAN The kids wouldn't believe that either. 
BOB ARCTOR Kids never believe anything anymore. 
Fred's phone rings. It jerks him out of his focus on the monitor. He pauses the tape and picks up the phone. 
FRED Yeah? 
TELEPHONE VOICE Fred, we've processed your tests. We need you to come back for the full battery. Tomorrow at three. Do you remember the room number? 
FRED Um... okay. 
TELEPHONE VOICE It's 203. Are you all right, Fred? Any confusion? Difficulty identifying persons or objects? Does anything you see appear inverted or reversed? Any space-time or language disorientation? 
FRED Um, what?   I just... what exactly have you processed... that is, is this in regard to the Lion's Club speech? 
TELEPHONE VOICE We'll take all that up tomorrow, Fred. 
Dial tone. Fred hangs up and fast-forwards the tape. He watches as the tape whirs through the machine. He presses stop, the tape jerks to a halt. Fred breathes hard, although it comes through the grid sounding oddly mechanical. He pushes play. Luckman is cleaning grass on the floor. Barris is in the corner winding string. Arctor rubs his finger on the lip of a wine glass, making it hum. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
ERNIE LUCKMAN ... this guy appeared on tv, claiming to be a world-famous imposter. He said he'd posed at one time or another as a great surgeon, a theoretical submolecular high-velocity particle research physicist, a Finnish novelist, a deposed president of Argentina... 
BOB ARCTOR He got away with it? Never got caught? 
ERNIE LUCKMAN See, the guy never really posed as any of it. He only posed as a world- famous imposter. Turns out he just pushed a broom at Disneyland, until he read about this actual world-famous imposter, and he thought, I can pose as all those things, then he thought, hell, I'll just pose as an imposter. Save a lot of time, a lot easier. Made almost as much money as the real imposter with books and movie rights. 
JIM BARRIS We see imposters in our lives, now and then. But not posing as physicists. 
ERNIE LUCKMAN Narks, you mean. Yeah, I wonder what a nark looks like? 
BOB ARCTOR It's like asking what an imposter looks like. I asked a hash dealer who'd been busted once what the nark who busted him looked like -- 
JIM BARRIS Looked just like us. 
BOB ARCTOR More so. The dealer dude told me the nark had longer hair than we do. I guess the moral is, stay away from guys who look like us. 
ERNIE LUCKMAN Narks give me the creeps. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
BOB ARCTOR How could a guy do that is what I want to know, pose as a nark? 
LUCKMAN AND BARRIS What? 
BOB ARCTOR Shit, I'm spaced. Pose as a nark. 
ERNIE LUCKMAN POSE AS A NARK? POSE AS A NARK? 
BOB ARCTOR My brains are scrambled today.      I better go crash. 
Fred freezes the tape.   He scribbles in notebook. 
SHOT OF NOTEBOOK 
Fred writes in a different handwriting now: choppy, backward- slanted, crabbed. 
FRED (V.O.) Posing as a nark. What does Arctor mean? 
INT. CHARLES FRECK'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Freck sits up in bed in his now electric yellow room, sipping magenta wine. The walls are dripping. 
CHARLES FRECK I've been burned. These are not reds, but rather some freaky psychedelic, the likes of which I have never seen. 
The wall across from Freck's bed parts with a sloshing sound, and an eight foot high creature with many eyes and ultra-hip clothing appears at his bedside, holding a scroll. 
CHARLES FRECK (CONT'D) Fuck. You're going to read me my sins, aren't you? 
The creature nods solemnly and unrolls the scroll. 
CHARLES FRECK (CONT'D) And it's going to take a hundred thousand million hours, isn't it? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
CREATURE We are no longer in the mundane universe. Your sins will be read to you ceaselessly throughout eternity. 
CHARLES FRECK Know your fucking dealer, man. 
CREATURE (reading from scroll) November 14, 1962, 3:08:23 pm: you did knowingly and with malice aforethought punch your baby sister Evelyn on the left side of the head when your mother was not looking. November 14, 1962, 3:08:27 pm: you did knowingly and with malice aforethought punch your baby sister on the left arm when your mother was not looking. November 14, 1962, 3:08:32 pm: you did... 
EXT. BOB ARCTOR'S FRONT YARD - DAY 
Arctor is finishing up mowing the lawn. He is intently focused on the task, but has done an erratic job: the left side of the yard has been left almost completely unmowed. Arctor turns to enter the house. We see that the left side of his face is completely unshaved. 
INT. ROOM 203 - DAY 
Fred is in the midst of a battery of tests being administered by two uniformed medical technicians who resemble the technicians who administered the previous tests, but are not the same. Fred's head rests in a contraption that divides his face in half, so his right eye and left eye can be exposed to different projected images. 
MEDICAL TECHNICIAN #3 Okay, Fred, in rapid succession you will see a number of objects pass before first you left eye, then your right eye. At the same time, on the panel before you, outlines of these objects will appear. You are to match, by means of the punch pencil you hold in your hand, the outline with the object. These images will flash very quickly so don't hesitate too long. You will be scored for time as well as accuracy. Okay?

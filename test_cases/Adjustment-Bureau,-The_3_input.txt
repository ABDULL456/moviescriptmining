INT. BUS -- MORNING 
David's phone rings again. As he reaches for the phone he fumbles his coffee cup, the lid comes off, and a slosh of coffee crests the brim and splashes on the woman's dress. 
DAVID Oh, Jesus... 
(FIGHTING LAUGHTER) I'm sorry. 
EXT. BROADWAY AND 19TH -- MORNING 
Harry's face. 
HARRY Shit! He's looking at a leather portfolio. We catch a glimpse inside: a complicated circuit diagram. Harry shuts the book, look's up to get a bead on" the the bus, then takes off down Broadway, again, hoping to cut it off at Union Square. 
INT.'BUS -- MORNING 
DAVID I'll pay for the damage. He pulls out his wallet. There's $7 inside. She laughs. 
WOMAN Hope your new job pays better than your old one. 
DAVID Give me your number and I'll send you a check. 
WOMAN God, that is smooth. Spill coffee on me then ask for my number. She takes the coffee from his hands and casually takes a sip, then turns back to him with a devilish look in her eyes. 
WOMAN Just let me spill some on you and we'll be even. She thrusts the cup toward his tie. David parries. 
DAVID It's my first day at the office! 
WOMAN Tell your boss some crazy chick dumped coffee on you on the MI. It's New York; he'll understand. She thrusts the cup back at him- 
DAVID No! He grabs the cup with both his hands over hers. 
WOMAN 
(ACTUALLY PLEADING) Come on. Just a little. They struggle with the cup. <,;:Both suppressing laughter. 
DAVID You're crazy. Actually crazy. The phone on David's lap'RINGS again. She snatches it with her free hand. 
WOMAN 
(INTO PHONE) He's not here! She hangs up. 
DAVID Who was that? She shrugs. Sorry, pal. He lunges for his phone, but she holds it on the other side of her body. 
DAVID What is this, third grade? 
WOMAN You forgot what that was like, didn't you? How fun it was... That stops him for a moment. Until the phone RINGS again. 
WOMAN Oh my God! How do you stand it? She drops the phone into the coffee. 
WOMAN There. We're even. He stares at her. Incredulous. They lock eyes. God knows what would come next if they were in private... The fourth RING gurgles up through the coffee. A beat. 
WOMAN Sturdy little fucker, isn't it? She pulls the phone out of the cup and wipes it off with her scarf, pushing the button which sends the call to voice mail. Then she reaches out her hand, as if to shake. 
WOMAN By the way, I'm Elise. 
EXT. UNION SQUARE -- DAY 
Elise exits.. the bus. David stands at the bus door watching her. She turns back to look at him. 
DAVID The morning after .I lost I woke up thinking about you . That melts her. Instantly. All her bravado drops. 
INT. BUS -- MORNING 
Moments later. Through the window, David watches Elise walking down the sidewalk. Their eyes meet. She blows him a little kiss before she turns the corner. His heart skips a beat as the bus continues on down Union Square East. 
EXT. UNION SQUARE -- MORNING 
Harry runs through Union Square bee-lining for David's bus. 
INT. BUS -- MORNING 
David looks at Elise's number, scribbled on a piece of paper. He carefully tucks her number into his wallet. Then takes the most satisfying sip of coffee he's ever had in his life-- 
EXT. UNION SQUARE -- MORNING 
Spotting David through the bus window, Harry thrusts his Fedora back onto his head and points at the bus-- 
INT. BUS -- MORNING 
Just as David finishes his sip the-plastic lid pops off the cup. A second earlier and the coffee would have poured all over his shirt. Instead it spills: on the floor.

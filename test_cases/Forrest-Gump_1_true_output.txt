Forrest knocks on Jenny's door. 
FORREST Jenny? Jenny? 
Forrest look around the field at the left. He notices Jenny and runs toward her.

FORREST Jenny, why didn't you come to school today? 
JENNY Hsh! Daddy's takin' a nap.

JENNY Come on! 
JENNY'S DAD Jenny, where'd you run to? You'd better come back here, girl!

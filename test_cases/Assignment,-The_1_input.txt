SUPER: TRIPOLI, LIBYA - MAY 1987 
INT. LIBYA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY 
A cold, dreary, oppressive airport. Grim-looking SOLDIERS and even more menacing SECURITY MEN in dark glasses. In the line of arriving PASSENGERS, at the passport control booth, is a limping Colombian businessman. Scanning the place from behind sunglasses, his heart is POUNDING, POUNDING, POUNDING. This is it. This is real enemy territory now, and he knows it. 
RAMIREZ'S POV 
The foreboding paranoia that everyone is staring at him. Soldiers, security men, airport employees, other passengers. They all seem to know his secret. They're all just waiting for the axe to fall. Ramirez heads over to the Customs booth. He turns back as a guard pushes him aside to let pass a rich Arabic family. A young fat girl holding some toys grimaces at him as she indelicately makes her way with her family through the crowd. In the b.g. we notice a Mercedes waiting for them through the glass doors of the airport. Ramirez continues on his way towards the Customs booth. Behind a curtain, he sees a man being searched. 
OFFICIAL El Pass'port! 
The sudden harsh voice jolts us all. 
CLOSE - OFFICIAL 
Pockmarked face with exaggerated features. Ugly and mean. Ramirez hands him his Colombian passport. The POUNDING quickens. 
OFFICIAL Sheil el Nadara! 
He barks in Arabic, motioning Ramirez to remove his sunglasses. Ramirez does, fighting to remain calm under the man's granite gaze. The official looks at the passport and back at Ramirez. The following dialogue is in Arabic with English subtitles. 
Now and for every other scene in which Ramirez passes himself off as Carlos, he has brown eyes. 
OFFICIAL Ricardo Moran Vargas? 
RAMIREZ Yes. 
CLOSE - RAMIREZ'S FACE 
Tiny beads of sweat begin to form on his forehead. 
OFFICIAL Your business? 
RAMIREZ Pipes. I sell pipes. 
OFFICIAL Pipes? 
Ramirez nods, smiling apologetically, searching for the words in Arabic. Ramirez struggles to appear calm. His heart's POUNDING, however, intensifies. 
RAMIREZ For the oil... 
OFFICIAL Oil? 
RAMIREZ Pipes for oil... Petroleum... 
OFFICIAL (after a beat) Step over behind the curtain. 
NEW ANGLE 
Ramirez's luggage is being thoroughly searched by the Official. Finally the Official looks up at him. 
OFFICIAL All right. You can go. 
Finally he stamps the passport. 
EXT. LIBYA PALACE HOTEL - DAY 
We have a shot of the cab, an old Mercedes coming towards us, and then under the arch leading to the entrance of the hotel. Ramirez steps out and he's assailed by a bunch of kids begging and trying to grab his baggage. He looks around. 
ANGLE - POV RAMIREZ 
Across the street at a cafe soldiers with guns laugh. From a shop window, the silhouette of a man seems to look right at us. Across the street, kids on a balcony throw a water balloon at a horse pulling a cart and the horse bolts right in front of Ramirez. 
BACK TO SCENE 
As the street urchins continue to beg and grab at his luggage, and the taxi driver demands impatiently to be paid, suddenly out of nowhere, a bellboy appears and smacks one of the kids who falls to the ground. They all disperse as the bellboy takes the luggage and leads Ramirez who pays the cab driver and then crosses to the hotel. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - LIBYA - DAY 
The bellboy enters with Ramirez, sets down his bags and then opens the shutters of the window. Ramirez tips him silently. Once the bellboy has left, Ramirez walks to the phone and checks it out. Then he crosses to the shutters. Perhaps he sees a shadow looking in his direction from the dark apartment across the street. He closes the shutters. Just then, there's a LOUD KNOCK on the door. He jumps and automatically goes for his gun. But he has no gun... and his heart begins to POUND again. The LOUD KNOCK repeats itself. 
RAMIREZ (in Spanish) Who's there? 
An incomprehensible response in Arabic. 
RAMIREZ (in accented English) What do you want? 
VOICE Room service. 
RAMIREZ (after a pause) I not order nothing. 
VOICE Iced water.

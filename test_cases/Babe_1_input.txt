He pulls away from Ken and follows Susan toward the E.R. 
192   INT. HALLWAY, E.R., MOROCCAN HOSPITAL -- NIGHT 
Several Moroccan doctors are examining Susan.    Richard observes worriedly from a window. 
One of the doctors comes out. 
MOROCCAN DOCTOR (In good English) We're going to have to operate immediately. 
RICHARD Is she going to be ok? 
MOROCCAN DOCTOR It's probable. We're going to try to save her arm.   She's been bleeding internally, and there's been some clotting so there's a high risk of gangrene. 
RICHARD (insistently, as if he hadn't heard the doctor) But she's going to be ok? 
The Moroccan doctor puts his hand on Richard's shoulder and thinks about his answer. 
MOROCCAN DOCTOR Yes, she's going to be ok. 
The doctor leaves and Richard goes back to looking at his wife through the glass. 
The doctors are still prepping her.   Richard walks in. 
193   INT. EMERGENCY ROOM -- NIGHT 
He stands next to Susan, who is unconscious. He looks at a doctor and she moves to one side. Richard leans over and kisses her. 
He walks away and the nurses start to wheel her to the O.R. 
194   INT. HALLWAY, MOROCCAN HOSPITAL -- NIGHT 
Richard is talking on the phone from an office. 
RICHARD Amelia? 
AMELIA (O.S.) Yes sir. 
RICHARD How is everything? 
AMELIA (O.S.) Ok sir, Mrs. Rachel told me. I'm very sorry. How is Mrs. Susan? 
RICHARD They're going to operate now... Amelia... take good care of the kids, and don't tell them anything... 
AMELIA (O.S.) No sir, don't worry. 
RICHARD Put Mike on please. 
A few seconds pass and Mike answers.   This is the phone call from the beginning. 
MIKE (O.S.) Hi dad. 
RICHARD Hey sweetie, how are you? 
MIKE (O.S.) Dad, guess what? Today, at school, they brought some baby chickens. 
RICHARD Oh really? 
MIKE (O.S.) I held one in my hand. He was really little and he was all warm. 
Richard starts to cry for the first time. 
MIKE (O.S.) (CONT'D) Dad, are you ok? 
Richard tries to hold back his sobbing. 
RICHARD Yeah, I'm ok. Everything's fine. 
The boy keeps talking while Richard cries. 
MIKE (O.S.) And Mariana wanted to take one home, but the teacher didn't let her... 
195   INT. CHIEKO'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT 
Chieko, naked, sits in an armchair, again submerged in the remote world of her silence. Before her, Kenji observes her nakedness, her sadness, her pained beauty. 
For a while they remain motionless. She seems to return from the long journey to herself and turns to look at him. Their eyes meet. There are still tears in Chieko's eyes. They hold each other's gaze until Chieko gets up, gets her notebook, scribbles down some words and gives them to him. 
Kenji reads them and looks at her. 
KENJI You don't have to apologize for anything. 
She sits down beside him. They look at each other again for a few, long seconds. Chieko takes his hand, strokes it for a moment, kisses it, sucks one of his fingers and then puts it back in its place. 
She grabs her notebook and starts writing a long note. It takes her almost a minute to do so. Kenji, nervous because of her proximity, watches her write feverishly. 
Chieko finishes writing, folds the note and hands it to Kenji. Kenji starts unfolding it, but Chieko stops him. She takes it away from him, folds it again and puts it in his breast pocket. She signals for him to read it later. 
Kenji gets up to go. She stands next to him. Her nakedness contrasts with Kenji's toughness. He bows his head to say goodbye and she moves aside for him to pass. Kenji walks past her as she watches. 
Kenji reaches the door. He opens it and turns to look at Chieko again, who has been left in the middle of the hall. He bows his head again and leaves. 
Chieko watches him leave and closes her eyes painfully. 
196   INT. ELEVATOR, CHIEKO'S BUILDING -- NIGHT 
Kenji rides the elevator down, touched, barely able to contain his emotion. The elevator doors open and he walks out. 
197   INT. LOBBY, TOKYO APARTMENT BUILDING -- NIGHT 
Kenji walks past the doorman. 
KENJI Good night. 
He keeps walking. On the other end of the lobby, at the parking lot entrance, Yasujiro walks in.

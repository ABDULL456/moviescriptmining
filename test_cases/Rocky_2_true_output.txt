Mike turns and exits with Rocky... The fighters curse them loudly in Spanish. 
INT. GYM - DAY 
Rocky and Mike move past fighters going through their training routines. 
ROCKY You were ready to bite that guy's face. 
MIKE Yeah -- See the fight last night?  Apollo Creed beat that English guy bad. 
ROCKY Creed's great. 
Mike fakes a friendly punch at Rocky and hurries off to another chore... 
INT. GYM - DAY 
The Owner, MICKEY, sits on a stool near the entrance.  He wears a baggy suit... He is in his late seventies. 
Rocky approaches... Mickey is conversing with another fighter. 
MICKEY I don't care what nobody says, this bum Creed woulda never made it in the Thirties -- 
ROCKY Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey? 
MICKEY (monotoned) ... What? 
ROCKY I said, how ya feelin'? 
MICKEY (dryly) Do you see me talkin'?  Huh? 
ROCKY (low) Yeah. 
MICKEY (spitting) Then stand there an' wait till I'm done -- Creed's good, yeah, he's real fine but I gotta boy, y'know Big Dipper, who's got the stuff it takes to be a champ -- He's mean, quick, an' big -- What more d'ya need?  Okay, go to work... (to Rocky) Hey -- Yeah -- Whatta ya want? 
ROCKY I was talkin' with ya man, Mike. -- Hey, how come I been put outta my locker? 
MICKEY Dipper needed it. 
Rocky turns and looks at DIPPER sparring... Dipper is a young, muscular heavyweight with a mean expression. 
MICKEY (continuing) Dipper's a climber -- You're a tomato. 
ROCKY ... Tomato? 
MICKEY Facts is facts.  I run a business here -- I'm cleanin' house -- 
Mickey pauses to watch a young middleweight time-skip as his trainer sings "FASCINATIN' RHYTHM." 
MICKEY (continuing) How old are ya? 
ROCKY ...What? 
MICKEY How old? 
ROCKY Come July, twenty-five. 
MICKEY More like thirty. 
ROCKY Twenty-five, thirty -- What's the difference? -- It took me two months to learn the combination of that locker. 
MICKEY The legs must be goin'. 
ROCKY Yeah, they're goin', -- that's nature... That was my locker for six years. 
MICKEY ... Did ya fight last night? 
ROCKY Yeah -- 
MICKEY Did ya win? 
ROCKY Yeah, Kayo. 
MICKEY ... Who'd ya fight? 
ROCKY Spider Rice. 
MICKEY Rice is a bum.

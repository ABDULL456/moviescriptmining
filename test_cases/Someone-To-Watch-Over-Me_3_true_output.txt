CLAIRE I know. 
The conversation is deeply caring; the tone opposite to the words. 
MIKE I'd miss my life... 
CLAIRE ... Don't explain. 
She rests her head on his shoulders again; they continue to dance. 
MIKE How long you going away for? 
CLAIRE Long enough. 
MIKE "For"...? 
CLAIRE "To"... Forget about you. 
CLOSE ON HER:  awash in the nearness of him. 
CLAIRE I'll have to pack a lot of clothes. 
MIKE (choked up) Yeah... 
He holds her tight -- his eyes EMOTIONAL as they roam the room -- 
But HIS EXPRESSION CHANGES as he SPOTS SOMETHING at a far end of the room.  Near the rear doors. 
It's a PLAINCLOTHESMEN, headed purposefully toward KOONTZ, conferring with him -- both men looking to MIKE, a sense of bewilderment in their eyes. 
ANGLE ON MIKE:  Stopping -- as KOONTZ heads quickly toward. 
KOONTZ Brook's patching a call through to you.  He thought he'd find you here. It sounds urgent. 
MIKE:  Baffled. 
KOONTZ He says it's your son. 
Exchanging a quick LOOK with CLAIRE, MIKE heads for the DOORS; she pauses, heading after. 
CUT TO: 
OUTER LOBBY - SAME 
as MIKE BARRELS through doors. 
KOONTZ (pointing) The office down the hall. 
MIKE BREAKS INTO A RUN. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  OFFICE - SAME 
as MIKE RACES IN; A PLAINCLOTHESMAN hands him the phone. 
PLAINCLOTHESMAN #2 He's crying. 
MIKE (grabbing the phone) Tommy?  What...? (frightened) What?!  Hello? (listening; stunned) Who is this? (trying to be calm) Yeah.  I'm listening. (quick) No.  Nobody but me. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  MIKE'S HOUSE - NIGHT - SAME MOMENT 
CLOSE ON the RECEIVER of the PHONE:  as JOEY VENZA'S mouth SPEAKS into it -- 
The images of ELLIE and TOMMY SEEN, dimly lit, in the background, petrified; GUARDED by a SECOND MAN (SOSA) whose figure is shrouded in darkness. 
VENZA I'm glad you're where I expected you to be, Detective Keegan, 'cause you're got two minutes to get home or I take your family out. 
CUT TO: 
MIKE - SAME 
caught in a nightmare. 
MIKE (desperate) I heard you.  I'll do it.  Just don't touch them. (a beat) I... (a pause) Lemme talk to my son. (suddenly) Hello? 
It goes dead.  MIKE PARALYZED with FEAR.  CLAIRE is ENTERING, PLAINCLOTHESMAN #1 close to her heels, MIKE'S breath coming in SHUDDERS as he stares helplessly at her -- then turns to the PLAINCLOTHESMAN and KOONTZ. 
MIKE (stunned) They got my family. (to Koontz) I need you guys. 
PLAINCLOTHESMAN #1 Who...

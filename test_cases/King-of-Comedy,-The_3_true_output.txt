PUPKIN, growing more frantic, pushes 4E. 
CUT TO: 
26   INT:   YOUNG' MAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
The YOUNG MAN is all over RITA.      No buzzer sounds. 
YOUNG MAN I'm really a very sensitive person. 
RITA Come on.   Get offa me. 
YOUNG MAN Sometimes I write poetry. 
RITA pulls herself away. 
RITA No! 
YOUNG MAN So you wanna play hard to get, huh? 
The YOUNG MAN grabs her. 
CUT TO: 
27   INT:   THE ENTRANCEWAY - NIGHT 
PUPKIN, even more desperate, pushes 4F. 
OLD LADY'S VOICE Â¿ Que es, por favor? 
CUT TO: 
28   INT:   YOUNG MAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
The YOUNG MAN is strong-arming RITA who is beginning to get frightened. 
RITA Come on.   Let's talk this over. 
YOUNG MAN I admire you very much.    I respect you, Mary. 
RITA (her eyes beginning to fill with terror) You're hurting me. 
YOUNG MAN I'm only doing what you want. 
RITA (pleading, on the verge of tears) Oh, please. 
CUT TO:

PUPKIN, frantic, pushes 4G. 
CUT TO: 
30   INT:   THE YOUNG MAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
The YOUNG MAN has RITA securely pinned and is starting to undo her blouse. She is desperate. 
YOUNG MAN Afterwards, you'll thank me. 
The buzzer sounds with great force.        It is one, long, 
protracted blast that breaks the YOUNG MAN's concentration. RITA takes advantage of the distraction to grab her bag and rush out as the buzzer continues to sound. 
CUT TO: 
31   INT:   THE ENTRANCEWAY - NIGHT 
PUPKIN still has his finger on 4G as RITA rushes out the EXIT door next to the elevator and comes rushing towards him. She is numb and emotionally exhausted. 
PUPKIN Rita! 
RITA (in desperation) What do you want? 
RITA keeps walking out of the entranceway and onto the street. PUPKIN is at her side. 
PUPKIN Don't be angry with me.     I was worried about you, that's all. 
RITA Just go home and leave me alone. 
PUPKIN take off his jacket and puts if around RITA's shoulders. 
PUPKIN (quietly) Here. You'll need this.      It's getting chilly. 
RITA I'm so bad.   I'm such a dummy. 
PUPKIN Don't say that, Rita.     Everyone does crazy things. 
RITA Not all the time. 
PUPKIN I'll get us a cab. 
PUPKIN rushes into the street and hails a cab.

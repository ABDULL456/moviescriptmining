You need relationships now more than ever... \nTHE VOICE belongs to RICHARD MORRIS, 40s. He sits in a leather chair, facing Lucian Adams, who's face we cannot see. \nSeated next to Morris, is Daniel Kiersey. \nMORRIS ...We've done business successfully before, Mr. Adams. But it's a larger scope now. I'm here today because I want to represent you exclusively. You need someone lobbying at a state level, as well as in Washington. My organization can provide both. We've got contacts that you don't have and other people can't get. Now, I'm aware that you have multiple businesses... However you need one go-to guy, so that all your ventures stay coordinated and all transactions and contracts are realized. I am that person, Mr. Adams. That's what I do. \nLUCIAN'S HAND lifts the cognac out of frame, drinks. \nKIERSEY What's this going to cost us? \nMORRIS As a retainer, I want an advance of three hundred-fifty thousand, along with ten percent of whatever economic benefit I bring to this organization. \nKIERSEY Three-fifty? C'mon, Dick. That's out of line. \nMORRIS If you want a quality global economic plan, that's what you pay for-- \nLUCIAN O.S. We'll give you two, Mr. Morris...That's what it's worth. \nMorris goes suddenly silent, looks across at Lucian. \nLUCIAN O.S. The advance is a drop in the bucket. The real money is the percentage. It's in your interest to see it my way. \nMorris stares across the desk, several tense moments. Then: \nMORRIS You've got a deal. \nINT.

GERMAN RUNES, SS BOLTS, HRUNGNIR'S HEART. And around his stomach, a belt of NORSE GODS with the words, \"INVISIBLE EMPIRE.\" Prison tats, dark and aged. \nLUCIAN What'd you name him? \nJESSE I named him Ray. \nLucian, no emotion, puts on a pressed dress shirt, fastens cuff-links. \nLUCIAN (over his shoulder) Heard the cops smacked you around inside. \nJESSE 'Wasn't too bad. \nLucian checks his hair. \nLUCIAN You've been a busy man, Jesse. More ways than one. \nJESSE Looks like you done just fine without me. Business rollin' through the door. \nAnd Lucian finally turns; looks at Jesse, eyes measuring... \nLUCIAN Last I saw you, you asked for time. Time to raise a family. Time to straighten things out. (pause) I gave you that time... Then safe jobs start poppin' up. Lafayette. New Orleans. Clinton. Baton Rouge. All over. The boys, they think it's niggers, gone widespread on a hunt for pig's feet. But they all professional. Burn jobs. Hot-weld oxygen. Laid out, burned, laid back, perfect. (locked on Jesse) I knew right then and there, only a white respectable burglar could've done this. \nJesse smiles slightly. They know each other well... \n...When Lucian's smile suddenly drops. There's a flash of controlled anger across his face; and WE FEEL a curtain of tension fall heavily on the room. \nLUCIAN Jesse... With all the work you been doin': Diamonds. Emeralds. A dozen safe jobs, behind my back... (predatory) Where's the tribute to the greater cause? \nJesse he pulls from his pocket, a tiny pouch. Sets it on the desk... \n", "test2_true": "JESSE Like I said, I just needed time. \nLucian approaches the desk, opens the pouch: DIAMONDS and EMERALDS... A slow smile spreads across his face. \nLUCIAN Well, even prophets stumble once in a while. \nLucian embraces Jesse. Tight. Then, softly in his ear: \nLUCIAN It's a shame about your brother. \nAs they part, their eyes meet. Something passes between them... \nI/E.

She's crying as he pulls her close, one arm around the baby. He says something to them we cannot hear... \nThen with the baby, Lynn boards her plane. An AGENT shuts the door.

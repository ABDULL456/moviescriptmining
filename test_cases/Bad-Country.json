{"train": "SHERRY Comin' up. \nBud blows smoke, distant from the others. \nMARANDINO Bud, we all supposed to be celebratin'. 'Been workin' this case for months. And you ain't said shit. \nBUD They had a lot of weight. Too much. \nCOBB It's a ring. Organized burglary. \nBUD You saw them guys. You think that half ass crew was organized? \nMARANDINO (laughs) They shit their pants in unison. \nCOBB What are you gettin' after, Bud? \nSHEPARD You think it was someone else's score. \nSherry arrives with shots of whiskey, moves on. \nBUD I think its a part of somethin' bigger. \nBud takes his shot. \nBUD Tomorrow morning we put our friends under the lamp. If they know this \"someone else\", we'll know him too. \nEXT. EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH JAIL - ESTABLISH - NEXT DAY \nA dark, stone monolith off the 110 highway. \nINT. OBSERVATION ROOM, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH JAIL - DAY \nBud smokes, standing with Shepard in semi-darkness. They're looking through a two-way mirror into an INTERROGATION ROOM, where Cobb interviews Ray Wheeler. \nRAY I told you... I keep tellin' you... I don't know nothin'. That's it. \nCOBB That's not it. We've been here all morning. We'll stay here all night. \nBud paces to a neighboring INTERROGATION ROOM where Marandino is questioning Grace (bruised face, swollen, broken nose). \nMARANDINO The stones you were fencin' belonged to an Amsec wall safe in \"Kay's Jewelers\". The rest from a vault in Bocage. Both owners can verify their belongings, and have. (beat) Who you fencin' for? \nGRACE Man, I ain't sayin' fuckin' shit. \nMARANDINO Then your name's on a dozen other jobs, just like it. \nGRACE That's bullshit. \nMARANDINO No, that's a promise. \nBud, sipping coffee, paces back to Ray's interview... \nCOBB We got a series of burglaries in the area. All over the last six months. All still open. You don't talk, it's on you. \nRAY Well I ain't got nothin' to do with that. \nCOBB Any idea who does? \nRAY No! Okay? Fuck no. \nBud sets down his coffee, calm. \nINT. GRACE'S INTERROGATION ROOM \nMarandino sits across from Grace, clearly frustrated. \nMARANDINO ...Answer the question. \nGRACE (exploding) MAN FUCK THIS! AND FUCK YOU! Y'ALL CREW'S JUST FAGGOTS IN MATCHING JACKETS! \nThe door blasts open. Bud charges in, throws Grace against the wall, then slams his face onto the table, pushing down. \nBUD Try this. I know you're too fuckin' dumb to be any more than a courier. I know you're coverin' for someone else. NOW TELL ME WHO THAT SOMEONE IS! \nGRACE I ain't a rat! \nBUD YOU AIN'T A RAT?! \nBud twists his broken nose. Grace SCREAMS. \nMARANDINO Easy, Bud. Go easy. \nGRACE (to Marandino) STOP THIS SHIT! STOP HIM! \nMarandino puts a hand on Bud's shoulder; Bud shoves him off. \nBUD LOCK THE DOOR! \nMarandino locks it. Bud turns Grace's nose even harder, nearly rips it off his face. \nBUD I'll teach you what commitment is... I'll throw you in an eight by nine and have you fucked in the ass by every inmate in the state of Louisiana-- AND THAT'S THE REST OF YOUR LIFE! \nGrace, spitting blood now. Choking. Bud twists. Bone cracks. \nBUD GIVE ME A NAME! \nGRACE (hacking) He's from Whiskey Bay--! \nBUD --GIVE ME A NAME!! \nLYNN Help... My baby...my baby... \nBud and Cobb enter from a back door, hurry towards Lynn. Bud lowers Lynn to the floor. \nBUD (to Cobb) CALL AN AMBULANCE! NOW! \nBEDROOM - TIME CUT \nA door slams open to reveal... \nA NAZI IRON EAGLE BATTLE FLAG. Draped across the far wall. Windows taped over. Walls painted black. \nMilitary surplus on every shelf and surface. Helmets. Uniforms. Body armor. Bayonets. \nBud in the doorway. Shepard joins him. \nBUD Toss everything. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nSeveral COPS(now on scene) ransack the house. Ripping open cabinets, drawers, tossing everything to the floor... \nGARAGE \nCobb flips a switch. A lamp illuminates a workbench. \nCOBB Alright, I want everything seized! \nCabinets, lockers and tool boxes slam open. Cops stop cold, blown away by what they see: GUNS. Everywhere. \nLIVING ROOM \nCOP #1 feels behind a couch. He finds a .38, then a COLT .25 below a chair cushion. \nBATHROOM \nCOP #2 removes the toilet's basin cover. With a pen, he removes a dripping .357. \nKITCHEN \nSeveral STATE TROOPERS lead Jesse in, cuff him to a table. \nATTIC \nFloor peels back. Flashlights illuminate: AMMUNITION BOXES. ASSAULT RIFLES. GRENADES. BONDS and COUNTERFEIT PLATES. \nMARANDINO Motherfucker's got a general store. \nLIVING ROOM \nCops talk excitedly over one another. Shepard leans over a mounted A.C. He finds a string and very slowly pulls up a ziploc bag filled with DIAMONDS. \nSHEPARD God damn...there's some weight. \nKITCHEN \nBud takes a seat at the table... \nFor the first time, we get a good look at Jesse Wheeler: Cold eyes. Handlebar mustache. Covered in tats. With a boilermaker's build, he looks what he is... DANGEROUS. \nBUD I'm Detective Lieutenant Bud Carter, of the East Baton Rouge Parish Precinct. (smiles) So how you like Baton Rouge? \nJesse's stare drifts to Bud. It's deadly. \nCabinets slam open and closed. Dishes hit the floor. \nJESSE What happened to my wife? \nBUD Water broke. She's en route to the hospital. \nCOP #3 is searching the refrigerator. Jesse watches as if he's seen something we haven't... Cop #3 moves on... \nJesse sees Bud's eyes. They connect with his own... \nBud opens the fridge. He scans condiments then stops. From inside a bag of HOT DOG BUNS, several sealed VIALS. \nBUD This is new. \nBud examines a vial's label: \"CYANIDE.\" \nBUD What's the cyanide for, Jesse? \nJESSE Extracting impurities. \nBud, right with him, grins. \nBUD Impurities from what? \nJesse, calm. Deadpan. \nBUD You're in a bad situation here, pal. \nJESSE I'll make bond. \nBud looks in Jesse's eyes and believes it. \nBEDROOM \nShepard, searching the room. Drawers, cabinets. Then leans down to peer under the bed... \nINTERCUT: \nINT. OFFICE, MARION PENITENTIARY, ILLINOIS - NIGHT \nCHARLIE BOWERS, on an official phone. At Jesse's name, he's DEAD QUIET... \nBUD Charlie, you there? \nCHARLIE What's your interest in this guy, Bud? \nBUD Well, we got him on weapons and burglary. But I got a feelin' there's more. \nCHARLIE Damn straight, a lot more. Race riots. Smuggling. Extorting a guard. I had a few run-ins with him myself. \nBUD What else? \nINT. BEDROOM, BUD'S HOUSE - PRE DAWN \nBud lies in bed, wide awake. The PHONE CONVERSATION carries over... \nCHARLIE V.O. You could say this is where he peaked. \nKITCHEN - DAWN \nCoffee pours into a mug. Then a shot of Irish Whiskey. \nCHARLIE V.O. He's a white supremacist. The worst kind, if there is one. \nBud, dressed now. The table is covered with various reports and photos from Jesse's file. BUD'S EYES guide us through... \nCHARLIE V.O. Came in on armed robbery and assault... \nBud picks up a photo: Jesse's Angola mug shot, age 23. \nCHARLIE V.O. But word in the system said, he's a contract killer for the Aryan Brotherhood. \nPhotos of Jesse's tattoos: SUN-WHEEL on the shoulder; HELL HOUNDS around the biceps, THOR'S ELAPID covering his back. \nCHARLIE V.O. In here, the guy became an organizer... \nINT. BUD'S CAR, TRAVELING - MORNING \nBud's face goes in and out of light and shadow. \nCHARLIE V.O. Controlling hits and movements inside the system. Prison to prison. State to state. \nINT. LOWER FLOOR, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - MORNING \nBud is walking with MURPHY, captain of the guards... \nCHARLIE V.O. Between the Aryan Brotherhood and Neo Nazis, he unified the front... \nBud and Murphy descend steps to a grim CORRIDOR. \nCHARLIE V.O. All them prison gangs in the world... Black Panthers, Mexican Mafia, forget it. The AB is deadly as it gets. And Jesse Wheeler was their ring leader. \nThe PHONE CONVERSATION fades out... Presently: \nBUD So what the fuck happened? \nMURPHY Processing ain't open till morning. We threw him in holding last night. 'Fore we even turn around, it's like we're back in the fuckin' Alamo. \nBUD He attack the guards? \nMURPHY Guards are fine. But he took on three niggers like they stole from him. \nMurphy stops outside a solid steel door. \nMURPHY I'll tell you somethin', Bud. After it happened, our block was the quietest it'd ever been. Wish we had ten just like him. \nBUD Open the door. \nINT. ISOLATION CELL - CONTINUOUS \nBud enters. Murphy shuts the door and a series of locks BOLT. We're in a stone closet. No bed or sink. No light. \nBUD Heard you refused a public defender. \nJesse's bruised face moves through shadow. \nBUD At the gas station...When you were arrested, I put a gun to your head. You expected someone else. \nJESSE You don't look like cops. \nBUD And your house? Guns. Mass supply tells me, intent to sell. Cyanide in the fridge, explosives...tells me you're scared. \nJesse's eyes emerge from the dark. Bud, looking right at him. \nBUD I know who you are. \nJESSE If you knew that much, you wouldn't be in here alone. \nBud smiles and walks to the door. \nBUD One more thing, pal. I saw the judge this morning. (grins) There is no bond. \nHOLD on Jesse. \nBud BANGS on the door. Locks UNLATCH. The door opens and Bud steps calmly out to the hall... \nRay fastens the safety collars and Jesse leans back. \nRAY His brains were on the wall, Jesse. Like somebody painted 'em. \nJesse does another set. Weights BANG down. He slowly sits up. \nJESSE They come at you? \nRAY Not yet... But it's in the mail. I can feel it fuckin' coming. \nRay shoots a look at a group of ARYAN BROTHERS across the yard. CZAPP, their \"leader,\" and ROACH. Jesse turns. Czapp looks at him. Eyes meet. Jesse leans back. \nThe press shakes as Jesse does a last set. His red strained face as the bar lands with a CRASH. \nINT. YARD CORRIDOR, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DAY, LATER \nA long line of prisoners are filing back through the gate. Ray, behind Jesse. Says low: \nRAY Hey, Jesse... (silence) Sorry I put you back here. I never meant-- \nJESSE (turns) \"Sorry\", Raymond...? You ain't sorry. (pause) I took you into my home. I tried to clean you up. And you steal from me...? You take my fuckin' diamonds? (dead to rights) 'Cause of you, I missed the birth of my son. \nRay swallows hard. Nothing he can say. \nINT. METRO OFFICE, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRECINCT - DAY \nCLOSE ON numerous files of ARYAN GANG MEMBERS. Arrest sheets, paperwork and photos. \nBUD O.S. Alright, let's work this... (beat) In prison, Wheeler is credited for the expansion of the Brotherhood. When Federal split up members, they had to reorganize. So they tattooed their blood types and serial numbers on one another. \nCOBB O.S. Recede and multiply. \nBUD O.S. Exactly... \nREVEAL NOW Bud and Shepard with Cobb and Marandino around a table, used as a converted eating area. \nBUD Put 'em in prison, they get stronger. Everywhere you send one, they recruit in numbers. Within five years, their numbers were over ten thousand. \nMARANDINO Wheeler directed all that, huh? \nShepard is flipping through a worn, thick file. \nBUD What do you got there, Shep'? \nSHEPARD Interpol wired us files on three known Aryan leaders in the state of Louisiana: Edgar Bingham. Harold Kay. And this man... Lucian Adams. \nHe opens the file, revealing mugshots of LUCIAN ADAMS, 51. Dark eyes. Sharp, gun metal features. \nSHEPARD High priest of the Aryan National Party. His \"ministry\" of Christian Identity and Paramilitary Order has stood for over a decade. Check this out... \nShepard pulls an old, faded surveillance photo: (Long shot) Lucian talking to a young Jesse outside a compound. \nSHEPARD Wheeler was just seventeen when he met Lucian at the Patriotic Congress. \nMARANDINO No shit. \nSHEPARD Today, Lucian's one hell of an entrepreneur. Owns surplus stores. Demolition. A piping business. Got trucks runnin' all across the God damn country. \nBud's been quiet; says now: \nBUD Stay focused. Get back to Wheeler... I need an angle. \nCOBB For what? If Wheeler ever flipped, news would spread like wildfire. The AB's gonna know about it. They'd gonna know about it nationally. (re: his coffee) Pass the sugar. \nMarandino does. \nBUD That's if he was a surface informant. I don't want him to testify. I want to keep him on the street. (to the group) Look, this guy's been in it a long time. He's up to his elbows; wants to shake his hands free. I can feel it. \nMARANDINO Braddock ain't gonna go for this. \nBUD I'll handle that. \nEveryone looks to Bud. \nBUD We got one chance here. 'Cause if this falls short... Jesse Wheeler's worth more dead than alive. \nINT. CAFETERIA, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - EVENING \nA sea of tables divided by race as far as the eye can see. \nJesse and Ray, trays in hand, find an island of ARYAN PRISONERS. They quickly part to make room for Jesse to sit. \nSuddenly Czapp and Roach arrive with their trays and abruptly sit across from the Wheeler brothers. \nCZAPP How you doin', Ray? (off Ray's look) We was just over there wonderin' why you ain't got the courtesy to introduce us to your kin. \nRAY I was gonna. \nCZAPP (grins) I'm sure you was. \nCzapp locks on Jesse, who calmly eats, not looking up. \nCZAPP Jesse Wheeler. Heard of you... \nROACH Fuckin-A, heard a lot. \nCZAPP Name's Czapp... You can call me, \"Bossman.\" (beat) I kept an eye on your brother the past few days for you. Ain't that right, Ray? \nRAY (low) Yeah... \nINT. VISITOR'S GATE, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DAY \nLynn, dark pouches under her eyes, goes through security check. INFANT SON in her arms. \nVISITING AREA \nWives, girlfriends and lawyers talk to prisoners. \nTABLE \nLynn, dark pouches under her eyes, holding their son, across from Jesse... \nLYNN Life. You know how fuckin' long that is, Jesse? \nLynn's hands are shaking. \nLYNN So what am I supposed to do? Wait? Run? (upset) Your friends are comin' by the house. Askin' questions, hangin' around. Waitin' for the God damn phone to ring. \nJesse is silent. \nLYNN You said we were done with this. That they were out of our lives. \nThe baby begins to CRY. \nLYNN We have no money, Jesse. Which means we have no fucking food. ...Say something, would you? \nJESSE It's gonna be okay. \nLYNN I'm afraid. I'm afraid for my life... \nThe baby WAILING now. \nLYNN (quietly crying) ...For our baby. \nTIGHT ON JESSE, for the first time, appearing powerless. \nAs Lynn wipes tears, trembling in her seat, Jesse looks away from his son, and glances up... \nBehind a glass partition outlying the room, a MAN is watching them... \nBUD. Stark still. Fixing Jesse with a hard stare. \nINT. PROPERTY ROOM, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - LATER \nA CLERK passes Lynn her belongings through chain link. She wipes her eyes, holding the baby. \nThe back bay doors open. Bud enters. Sleepless, wrinkled clothes. \nBUD Lynn Wheeler. We haven't been properly introduced. I'm Detective Bud Carter. \nLYNN I know who you are. \nBUD You have a ride home? \nLYNN We took the bus. \nBud peels a few bills from a fold, puts it on the counter. \nBUD Take a cab. \nBud lays his card atop the bills, looks at Lynn. \nBUD 'You need anything...anything at all. Be sure to call me. \nThey look at each other. She pulls her baby close. There's an unspoken moment. And Bud walks away... \nLynn waits till Bud is out of view. Then takes the money. And the card. \nINT. CELLBLOCK, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DAY \nA Guard buzzes Jesse through. \nPRISONERS line the tier. Smoking cigarettes. Looking out. Jesse walks past, enters... \nHIS CELL \n...where Ray sleeps in shadow on the bottom bunk. \nJesse pulls a Polaroid from his pocket: His infant son. He gazes at the photo for a beat, then brings it to Ray... \nJESSE Ray... \nNo response. Jesse nudges his brother's shoulder. \nJESSE Raymond, take a look. \nJesse rolls him over. Ray is limp. A filthy SYRINGE imbedded his arm. Jaw slack. Eyes wide and vacant. \nTHE PHOTO FLUTTERS FROM JESSE'S HAND TO THE FLOOR... \nJesse lowers, pulling Ray to his arms. He shuts his eyes. Teeth clench. And as Jesse feels the bile rising, his massive frame begins to shake... Then we realize, he's crying... \nTIME CUT: \nEXT. LOADING DOCK, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DUSK \nPouring rain. Ray's corpse is loaded onto an ambulance. \nINT. JESSE'S CELL - DUSK \nBUD How about personal warranty? \nJESSE Warranty?! \nBUD Yeah, that's right! You've been a part of the problem so long, you've forgotten what the fuck that is! (boaring in) \"Finance...\" Your wife came here on a bus to see you. I sent her home in a cab. Is that your outside fuckin' finance?! \nBeat. Jesse, taken back. \nBUD Let me give you a little insight, pal. As to what I know... And what you think you know. \nBud flips open a file and shoves a series of grainy B&W SURVEILLANCE PHOTOS in front of Jesse. \nBUD This is today... \nPhoto #1: Outside Jesse's House. A distressed Lynn and the baby being led into a car by Catfish. \nBUD Is that your house? That's your wife, right? Who's this guy? \nPhoto #2: Tight-shot of Catfish. \nBUD (off Jesse's look) Know where he's takin' them? Takin' your family? I got a pretty good fuckin' idea. \nPhoto #3: An anonymous duplex. Catfish escorting Lynn and the baby inside, past several surly Aryans looking on. \nJesse finally averts his eyes... \nBUD Look at your wife, Jesse. Look at her face. And your son. They look safe to you? (a moment) I'm all you've got! I'm all your family's got! And the longer you're in here, they're up for grabs. \nON JESSE. The wheels turning. Burning. THE CAMERA MOVES IN... \nBUD So either you let that happen... Or I get the judge to allow bond. This never sees trial. And you work for me. \nAnd that's where it hangs... \nBLACK. \nJUDGE V.O. Jesse Wheeler. Please rise... \nFADE IN: \nINT. COURTROOM, BATON ROUGE - DAY \nJesse rises, wearing a suit. JUDGE PONDER, at the bench, presides over this arraignment hearing: \nJUDGE PONDER You stand accused of forty counts of burglary, twenty nine counts of felony theft, possession of illegal firearms, possession or dealing in unregistered weapons, possession of a controlled substance, manufacture and possession of incendiary devices, and seventeen counts of receiving stolen goods... How do you plead? \nCUT TO DANIEL KIERSEY, 40s, sharp, confident, expensively dressed. Jesse's attorney, rising: \nKIERSEY Not guilty, Your Honor. \nJUDGE PONDER Let's hear the arguments for bail. \nThe DISTRICT ATTORNEY rises from his seat: \nDISTRICT ATTORNEY Your honor, this man is an habitual felon as well as a flight risk. Our office has overwhelming evidence that Mr. Wheeler is not only guilty, but also a serious threat to the community. The State recommends that bail be denied. \nKIERSEY Your honor, my client deserves a reasonable bail. He has every intention of appearing and answering to all these false charges. In addition, he is the sole provider for his wife and newborn child, who would suffer undo hardship if this man were incarcerated. \nCUT TO Judge Ponder: \nJUDGE PONDER Bond is set at one million. \nTHE GAVEL BANGS DOWN. Kiersey shakes Jesse's hand. Smiles: \nKIERSEY Congratulations. \nREVEAL BUD -- seated in back, watching the proceedings. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BEDROOM, JESSE'S HOUSE - PRE DAWN \nLynn, asleep in bed... \nINT. HALLWAY \nJesse stands, holding his son, quietly comforting him. When Jesse turns, WE SEE a .45 tucked in his back. \nAND THE PHONE RINGS... \nJESSE (answers) Yeah... \nSTATIC; he listens, then: \nJESSE (into phone) Okay. \nEXT. BACKYARD, JESSE'S HOUSE - PRE DAWN \nJesse steps through his fence into deep WOODS, to find a CAR waiting idyll on a dirt road. \nINT. CAR - PRE DAWN \nA HEAVY-SET MAN at the wheel. Jesse gets in as the headlights spin on and the car pulls away... \nEXT. SHIPYARD - PRE DAWN \nDark. Eerie and desolate. The car arrives. Jesse steps out and disappears into the shadows of a towering crane. \nOn the jetty, a nondescript MAN stands alone against the calm Mississippi. His back is to us. \nJesse parks -- walks up the porch, where Catfish is relaxing, shoulder holster, revolver. And Buzz, cleaning a pistol. \nBUZZ Jesse. \nJesse nods, eyes Catfish. \nJESSE I'm here to see Lucian. \nCatfish grinds out his cigarette, gets to his feet. \nCATFISH He's busy right now; You can come in and wait. \nINT. LUCIAN ADAMS' OFFICE - DAY \nCLOSE ON: A SNIFTER \nas Louis XIII pours to the rim. From elsewhere in the room: \nMALE VOICE This operation of your's has become big business. You need relationships now more than ever... \nTHE VOICE belongs to RICHARD MORRIS, 40s. He sits in a leather chair, facing Lucian Adams, who's face we cannot see. \nSeated next to Morris, is Daniel Kiersey. \nMORRIS ...We've done business successfully before, Mr. Adams. But it's a larger scope now. I'm here today because I want to represent you exclusively. You need someone lobbying at a state level, as well as in Washington. My organization can provide both. We've got contacts that you don't have and other people can't get. Now, I'm aware that you have multiple businesses... However you need one go-to guy, so that all your ventures stay coordinated and all transactions and contracts are realized. I am that person, Mr. Adams. That's what I do. \nLUCIAN'S HAND lifts the cognac out of frame, drinks. \nKIERSEY What's this going to cost us? \nMORRIS As a retainer, I want an advance of three hundred-fifty thousand, along with ten percent of whatever economic benefit I bring to this organization. \nKIERSEY Three-fifty? C'mon, Dick. That's out of line. \nMORRIS If you want a quality global economic plan, that's what you pay for-- \nLUCIAN O.S. We'll give you two, Mr. Morris...That's what it's worth. \nMorris goes suddenly silent, looks across at Lucian. \nLUCIAN O.S. The advance is a drop in the bucket. The real money is the percentage. It's in your interest to see it my way. \nMorris stares across the desk, several tense moments. Then: \nMORRIS You've got a deal. \nINT. LIVING ROOM, LUCIAN ADAMS' HOUSE - DAY \nMorris emerges from the office. He glances at Jesse, then shrugs on his coat and leaves... \nJesse looks back at the office doorway. FOLLOW Jesse in... \nINT. LUCIAN ADAM'S OFFICE \n...past Kiersey, behind a massive desk in this impeccable room, we finally SEE LUCIAN ADAMS. \nJesse is not invited to sit. \nLUCIAN (to Kiersey) Give us a minute. \nKiersey walks out and shuts the door... \nON LUCIAN \nhe crosses slowly to a credenza, selects a clean shirt. \nLUCIAN You have a son now, right? \nJESSE Yeah... \nAs he removes the shirt he's wearing, REVEAL tattoos: BLACK SUN on his back. GERMAN RUNES, SS BOLTS, HRUNGNIR'S HEART. And around his stomach, a belt of NORSE GODS with the words, \"INVISIBLE EMPIRE.\" Prison tats, dark and aged. \nLUCIAN What'd you name him? \nJESSE I named him Ray. \nLucian, no emotion, puts on a pressed dress shirt, fastens cuff-links. \nLUCIAN (over his shoulder) Heard the cops smacked you around inside. \nJESSE 'Wasn't too bad. \nLucian checks his hair. \nLUCIAN You've been a busy man, Jesse. More ways than one. \nJESSE Looks like you done just fine without me. Business rollin' through the door. \nAnd Lucian finally turns; looks at Jesse, eyes measuring... \nLUCIAN Last I saw you, you asked for time. Time to raise a family. Time to straighten things out. (pause) I gave you that time... Then safe jobs start poppin' up. Lafayette. New Orleans. Clinton. Baton Rouge. All over. The boys, they think it's niggers, gone widespread on a hunt for pig's feet. But they all professional. Burn jobs. Hot-weld oxygen. Laid out, burned, laid back, perfect. (locked on Jesse) I knew right then and there, only a white respectable burglar could've done this. \nJesse smiles slightly. They know each other well... \n...When Lucian's smile suddenly drops. There's a flash of controlled anger across his face; and WE FEEL a curtain of tension fall heavily on the room. \nLUCIAN Jesse... With all the work you been doin': Diamonds. Emeralds. A dozen safe jobs, behind my back... (predatory) Where's the tribute to the greater cause? \nJesse he pulls from his pocket, a tiny pouch. Sets it on the desk... \nINT. METRO OFFICE - NIGHT \nAn organizational chart, as Bud pins AB mug shots, arrest sheets and surveillance photos wall to wall. \nBud steps back, observes. His case building. Getting huge. \nMONTAGE OUT/TO: \nEXT. BACK PATIO, LUCIAN'S HOUSE - DAY \nWood secluded. Lucian, Jesse and Kiersey sit around a table. \nKIERSEY There's a variety of matters to discuss today, gentlemen. Eddie Moran's trial starts next week. One of the jurors reached out. He's asking six thousand up front plus a job at four hundred a week. That guarantees a hung jury with a push for an acquittal. \nLUCIAN Three hundred. Give him a no-show at the trucking firm. \nKIERSEY (as he writes) Construction on the building Morris brought us, in south-east Florida, is complete. Every unit sold. We should see revenues of one point four million over our original projections. \nLucian lights a cigar, smoke curls from his lips. \nKIERSEY Lastly, our \"friends\" from the Middle East. They put a final offer on the table. They'll fund our operation in Louisiana if we agree to act on their behalf. Political targets mostly, on the basis of our approval... (beat) I advise we do a test case. Perhaps a sample of their resources. \nLUCIAN \"Final offer?\" Demands... (beat) Close the deal. We'll cook the cash for it. By the time they realize, we'll have our return. (laughs to Jesse) You believe they're travelin' all the way to Louisiana just to get fuckin' robbed? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LUCIAN'S BACK YARD - LATER \nJesse and Lucian walk together through green, expansive countryside. A pair of Arabian mares graze nearby. \nLUCIAN I want you runnin' point on this one... \nJESSE I'll be honest, I was hopin' for somethin' bigger. \nLUCIAN What do you got in mind? \nJESSE How 'bout a few of them heads off the list? \nLUCIAN We got guys for that now. Catfish, Buzz. What do you want to go back to that for? \nJESSE The money's worth twice this. Bring back a head it's fifteen grand; Bring a heart, it's thirty, right? \nLucian looks at Jesse, who feels Lucian's scrutiny. \nLUCIAN Tell you what. Do this other thing we got lined up... (beat) Then I'll give you that taste. \nEXT. HENDERSON INDUSTRIAL ZONE - ESTABLISH - NIGHT \nDark, factory skyline. Burnt out cars sit before a WAREHOUSE. \nINT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT \nHEADQUARTERS for the Baton Rouge operation. A beehive of government activity. TECHNICIANS listen to tapes... PHONES ring off the hook... Bud and Fitch going over the case: \nFITCH There's pressure from Washington. They send compliments for Jesse's work. But our primary concern is that list. I need names we can protect. \nBUD We know that, Fitch. He's workin' on it. \nFITCH If Jesse can just get a direct order... from Lucian to him, on a wire-- \nBUD --A wire?! He just went back to work, you want him to wear a fuckin' wire? (beat) Put a tap on that God damn lawyer's phone, that's what you should do. \nFITCH He's an attorney, Carter. Anything we get would be inadmissable. \nBUD It's information, Fitch. \nFitch, annoyed, but staying on track. \nFITCH Bud. We need Jesse to engage Lucian on the record. Otherwise it's just hearsay. He's disconnected from everything, like a ghost. \nBud, cooling his heels. As the phones RING and RING... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nA violent rainfall. \nAERIAL SHOT swooping along the HIGHWAY, then rising above the deep woods to reveal a TRUCK STOP ahead. \nEXT. TRUCK STOP - NIGHT \nClosed for construction. A VAN arrives. A blinking barricade is pulled back, allowing entrance... \nGenerators light the scene: A group of SHIITE MUSLIMS wait by a pair of idle FREIGHT TRUCKS. A crew of five AB SOLDIERS exit the van: Jesse, Catfish and Buzz among them. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LUMBER STORAGE, TRUCK STOP - NIGHT \nThe door to one Freight truck rolls to the top, revealing a converted ASSAULT WEAPONRY SHOWCASE. \nBelow covered scaffolding, both crews stand. Guns bulge through their coats. No talking. No sudden movement. \nShiites watch Jesse and Catfish examine the merchandise: SEMI AUTOMATICS, SHOTGUNS, CARBINES, SUB-MACHINE GUNS... \nEveryone looks at each other. Jesse acknowledges worth. \nCatfish pulls a large CANVAS BAG from the van, filled with cash. As he carries it toward a bench, a large Shiite (OMAR) reaches for the bag before Catfish can set it down... \n...Both men hold tight. Neither letting go. And there's a moment. \nJESSE (low, deadly) Fuck me up again, you hear me? I'll leave you where I find you. Got that? \nPAUSE. Catfish glares, then concedes. \nJESSE Unload the fuckin' truck. \nJesse starts moving crates from the Freight onto the bread truck. Catfish and Buzz watch for a moment, then join. \nINT. FBI WAREHOUSE - LATE NIGHT \nTelevisions broadcast news coverage of the shoot-out. AGENTS work, uncomfortable, as Bud and Fitch argue. Explosive... \nFITCH Keep your voice down! This was out of my control! \nBUD I'm telling you, your agents best pull their shit together! Who the hell y'all trying to protect?! \nFITCH Look, Carter. This is a joint task force with multiple agendas, that run up the chain of command through me. Intel came forth at the eleventh hour that Naseem Kazuri - an international arms dealer - would be present at this meet. ATF was tasked to observe and report. \nBUD That ain't what they did--! \nFITCH --No! Because your informant-- \nBUD My informant, that's right!-- \nFITCH --Your informant and his psychopath crew greased half our political interests -- over a bag of fake cash! You weren't informed, so what? \nBUD Well I better be informed! 'Cause this ain't fallin' short! Now, any of y'all got a collaborative agenda in the works? I want to see it. These other agencies, what time-lines they lookin' at? What deadlines and why? \nFITCH Above your pay-grade-- \nBUD (overlapping) And is there a purposeful lack of communication between competing agencies, who are right now charting future mistakes, as we fuckin' speak?! \nFITCH That's not your concern, Carter! \nBraddock suddenly arrives, steps into the room... \nBUD We're not talkin' about me!! \nBRADDOCK Bud! \nBUD (spins) What?! \nBRADDOCK You're over-involved here. \nAnd Bud's taken off stride. Braddock looks Bud right in the eyes, so there's no doubt... \nBRADDOCK I'll handle this. \nBud, red with anger, walks out. \nBraddock watches him go. Fitch comes over, relieved... \nFITCH Thanks for coming down, Mike. He's been berating my agents for the last hour. \nBraddock pours a cup of coffee. \nFITCH We're trying to band-aid a situation here, and frankly, Carter's preference for thug tactics isn't helping. It'll all be in my report... \nBRADDOCK (interrupts) \"Isn't helping?\" \nA big mistake. Now Braddock turns on Fitch, zeroing in... \nBRADDOCK \"Isn't helping?\" Let's not miss what happened here, Fitch. We work for the same cause doesn't mean we work for you. What are you gonna do now? Send Jesse back out? Earn his trust? Bud Carter delivered the biggest informant in the history of this state to your lap, and you and the people you work for are gonna let it go to shit. (beat) You can expect that will be in my report. \nCUT TO: \nINT. STEEL MILL - PRE DAWN \nSTEELWORKERS warped in heat waves swing ingots into troughs.

STEEL MILL OFFICE - PRE DAWN \nLucian shuts the door and sits before an ill at ease Morris. \nMORRIS Look. I had no previous knowledge of any business with Muslims. So if stealing me here in the middle of the night, is some kind of accusation-- \nLUCIAN I'm not accusing you, Mr. Morris. But I do find it interesting that right about the time I employ you, my operation starts having problems. \nMORRIS Yes, but-- \nLUCIAN That is interesting...isn't it? \nMorris swallows hard as Lucian stares intensely. \nLUCIAN I want to know if this was an isolated incident. If the ATF impeding on my work is the result of a deeper threat. \nMORRIS What are you suggesting? \nLUCIAN I'm suggesting you contact your friends in Washington. \nMORRIS With all due respect, Mr. Adams, that's not what I was retained for. \nLUCIAN Well now it is. \nLucian puts on his reading glasses, opens a dossier. \nLUCIAN Three months... \nLucian peruses surveillance photos: Images of AB activity goes by in a blur. Lucian's eyes absorbing, rigid, unerring. \nKIERSEY (reading) This is U.S. Attorney John Nokes, at the helm. He's been after us for years. \nLUCIAN Who they got for a mouthpiece? \nMORRIS A \"mouthpiece\"? \nLUCIAN Who's the rat in the woodpile? Who the fuck's giving 'em information? \nMORRIS I couldn't dig that deep. But it's someone close. (pause) I suggest you gentlemen disband. Immediately. \nKiersey, foraging through reports.

That's why nobody wants the job... That's why we're here talkin'. \nJESSE Who is it? \nLucian sets a photo on the table, face down with an address written on back. \nJesse flips over the photo: It's Bud, in uniform. \nLUCIAN This cop... he's got a mouthpiece... somewhere. Ain't yet figured out who. In the meantime, shut him down. \nON JESSE, a frozen moment.

The plan is-- \nBUD No, the truth is, Fitch, you ain't got balls big enough to relate to this guy. If you had listened to me, we wouldn't be in this situation. Jesse wouldn't be in this situation.

VAN - LATE NIGHT \nMarandino, fastens on a vest, loads a 12-Gauge, locks. \nSuddenly, through the side window... A LONE FIGURE, IN A QUARTER TRENCH, MOVES PAST. It happens in a flash. \nMarandino LOOKS, SEES only a quick profile as the Figure cuts between parked cars and walks across the street... \nMARANDINO (into radio) I need eyes on a single, white male crossing Esplanade. Possible intent... \nEXT. CAFE - LATE NIGHT \nCobb looks over his shoulder, SEES the Figure 75 yards away, moving briskly across Esplanade... \nWe still can't see his face. \nINT.

Dope-thin, bloodshot eyes. He looks at Bud. Bud looks at him... Ray clicks on the TV and opens a beer. \nTV IN: Evening news. The storm outside alters the reception. \nNEWSCASTER ...And today, thirty-one year old Gary Plauche pleaded innocent by reason of insanity, to charges of second-degree murder in the slaying of accused sex offender, Jeffrey Doucett. \nBud watches Ray empty a gram of coke onto the bar.

But I am interested. \nAnd the volume of the TV now becomes more apparent... \nNEWSCASTER O.S. ...As a result of numerous threats made weeks ago, tight security surrounded the courthouse. However, missing from today's hearing, was the arresting officer. \nBud has been tuning out the TV distraction... until that last statement. He sneaks a look. \nNEWSCASTER From East Baton Rouge Sheriff's office... \nA wave of static scrambles the picture. When it clears... \nNEWSCASTER O.S. ...Police Lieutenant, Bud Carter. \nBud is stunned. HIS OWN FACE APPEARS ON THE SCREEN. A younger photo of Bud, clean shaven - DRESSED IN POLICE UNIFORM. \nEXT.

Then turns the corner... \nGRACE'S POV: A SHOVEL swings from around the corner, WHAM!!! \nThe blow sends Grace sailing back. He SLAMS on the ground, with a blood-covered broken face.

Bud with a long lens camera, triggers snapshots. \nINT. DINER - DAY \nGreasy spoon, soul food joint. Trucker and labor patrons. \nBud walks in, perplexed to find Braddock sitting with MARTIN FITCH (30), Deputy Chief of Staff for US Attorney General. Pressed suit. Young face. Out of his element. \nBUD Hey, Mike. \nBRADDOCK Bud, this is Special Agent, Martin Fitch. He's down from Washington. With the Attorney General. \nFITCH Martin. Just call me Martin. \nFitch offers his hand, smiles. Bud shakes. \nBRADDOCK Martin's gonna be soliciting Jesse's case for a Federal sponsor. \nBUD How long you been with the Attorney General, Fitch? \nFITCH Just over a year. \nBud looks at Braddock. \nFITCH I want to assure you my education and experience is more than adequate to handle a case of this potential. \nBUD Is that right... \nFitch's smile drops as Bud stares him down. \nBRADDOCK Why don't we get to the particulars? \nFITCH Right. Alright. (clears throat) To get Jesse a federal sponsor, we need something substantial. A bait. In the Justice Department, we have this mission statement... We decide who the target is, what's the threat assessment, the cost value, over what time table it's gonna take place... Which target do we go after first. We don't want to miss a big target hitting a smaller target, you understand? \nBUD No. \nFITCH Well, exposing bodies has limitations. Those people are dead. We can't retrieve their lives. \nBud blinks. \nBRADDOCK He means there might not be enough to back Jesse. \nBUD Keep him on the street without protection, he winds up dead. \nFITCH What I'm saying is, we need fresh leads. He'll need to present something that separates him from those we're going to arrest. If Jesse can't offer something continuous... I'm afraid we can't be of much help. \nBud stares at Fitch. \nA WAITRESS in her 50s approaches. \nWAITRESS Ready to order? \nFITCH (cuts in) Yes. I'll take a garden salad. Roquefort on the side. \nWAITRESS You'll take what? \nFITCH (curt) It's a dressing. \nWAITRESS Well...we got ranch, thousand island and oil. Which one you want? \nBud's chair SCRAPES back as he stands, stares hard at Fitch: \nBUD Lost my appetite. \nAnd walks out. \nEXT. PARKING LOT OUTSIDE DINER - DAY \nBud stalks out to his car. Braddock follows, agitated. They say nothing till they reach the car. \nBUD I set this up. Me and Jesse. If the Feds want to help, that's fine. But not him. \nBRADDOCK What do you mean, \"me and Jesse?\" He's not your partner, Bud. This case is beyond our capacity. It requires resources we don't have. \nBud unlocks the car. They stand, talking across the roof. \nBUD They ain't takin' us serious, Mike. They send us some kid with a year under his belt?! He don't even know what state he's in... You want him in charge?! \nBRADDOCK You're God damn right I do! You're out on a limb on this already, Bud! It's my job to make sure you get back! \nBUD This is bullshit. \nBRADDOCK That may be. What it ain't, is open for discussion. \nBraddock walks away. Bud simmers a moment, gets in his car. \nINT. A ROOM - FOLLOWING MORNING \nA bare room; nothing to tell us where we are. Jesse's on a stool. He runs his fingers down his mustache, grits his teeth. \nJESSE Y'all wanna talk about crime? Well I could tell y'all things. Names. Locations. What boat is movin' what drugs, which one is guns. Who's gonna get cut up and why. ...But what I got to know is, if 'n when I do this... If I wear your dog collar... Y'all gonna do what's right by me and keep my head from gettin' shot the fuck off? 'Cause the truth is, you need me. You ain't got enough cops with enough sense or enough time, to clear them crimes that already been committed and will be. (pause) Y'all need me... I got the devil's address. \nREVERSE: We're in a HOTEL SUITE. \n", "test2_true": "Bud stands by the door with Braddock. And Fitch steps forward, laughs nervously... \nFITCH Okay, great... Thanks. Thank you, Jesse, for that. And thank you, everyone for attending... (tight) Uh, we all know why we're here. To solve a matter of custody-- \nFBI #1 We'll protect you and your family, Jesse. (to the room) It's a federal matter, gentlemen. Those bodies were transported over state lines. \nAn ATF AGENT #1 imposes: \nATF #1 Not so fast. Ammunition, grenades? This man's house was a factory, for Christ's sake. ATF is taking this. \nDEA Those murders were drug related. DEA's got to do follow ups. \nSECRET SERVICE He was printing counterfeit money. That's Secret Service. \nARGUING ENSUES, Agents' voices step over one another. Fitch tries to take control. Jesse's been silent, until... \nJESSE There's a hit list. \nFitch hears this. He turns, loudly to the room... \nFITCH Wait! Wait a minute, quiet! Everyone quiet! \nAnd EVERYTHING stops. Fitch moves to Jesse: \nFITCH A what? \nJESSE A hit list. There's much as twelve. Might be one or two less now, I ain't sure. Some could've already been gotten. \nBUD (to Braddock) Now we're talkin'. \nFBI #2 approaches Jesse... \nFBI #2 Why these twelve, Jesse? \nJESSE Different reasons. It ain't so much why or what they done that matters. Pick any one of 'em off that list, AB puts you on salary. \nEveryone is suddenly interested. Bud sees this. \nJESSE And you, sir, if I ain't mistaken... You're Mr. Nokes, right? \nAgents part, revealing JOHN NOKES(50s), black, an emminent figurehead in a plush suit. Surprised to be pointed out... \nJESSE First U.S. Attorney, John Nokes? \nNOKES That's right. \nJESSE Well, last time I seen it...you was number two on that list. \nIt's quiet. Nokes thinks. Then LAUGHS and approaches Jesse. \nNOKES Can you fill us in on the rest of those names, Jesse? \nJESSE Yes, I can. But there's something I gotta make clear 'fore that happens. \nNOKES What's that? \nJESSE I've listened to you, Mr. Nokes. And I've listened to these suits here, on who's gonna take me in... (beat) I will die, go to hell and take all y'all cocksuckers with me, if he-- (motions to Bud) --tells me to. (beat) I want y'all to know that. \nJesse is explosive under the low projection delivery and a CHILL falls over the room. \nNOKES (to Bud) How's that fly by you, Lieutenant? \nBud simply nods. \nNOKES I'll sponsor him. Jesse's welfare will come out of our budget. Anyone has pending cases or leads for Jesse, see me. I'll loan him out. \nJesse stares at Nokes. As the meeting settles back to a comfortable level... \nNOKES And, Jesse... I'm a little pissed I'm number two on that list. Who the fuck is number one? \nThe room erupts with LAUGHTER. Everyone except Bud and Jesse. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. GRAND COUTEAU - DAY \nJesse's truck moves over an old wooden bridge through sweeping fields that stretch to a vast, wooded area. \nEXT. FRONT GATES, PRIVATE PROPERTY - DAY \nJesse stops at a long drive protected by locked iron gates. \nA surveillance camera zooms in. Jesse looks up. A second camera pans on Jesse, staring... \nMOVE IN as crackling, electronic pixels FILL THE FRAME and... \nCUT TO: \nINT. GUARD STATION - SAME \nA BANK OF MONITORS showing Jesse at the gates.

Suddenly... \nIN THE REFLECTION: BUD EXPLODES DOWN THE STAIRS, AND SLAMS INTO LUCIAN WITH THE IMPACT OF A TRUCK. BOTH HIT THE FLOOR. \nLucian points his gun at Bud's head, who reaches for the trigger guard, shifts the barrel an inch -- A ROUND GOES OFF, BLOWING THROUGH BUD'S SHOULDER -- HE YELLS OUT, HOOKS HIS FINGER IN THE TRIGGER, STOPPING THE NEXT SHOT. \nBud flips Lucian over, rips the gun away. Lucian tries to break free. Bud grabs him - smashes the gun over and over against Lucian's face. \nLucian's head BOUNCES. Eyes roll, then right. \nLucian quarter rolls, then CRACKS a forearm into Bud's head. Again, and Bud is knocked back with a gash over his eye. \nLucian REARS BACK and KICKS HARD into Bud's sternum. \nLucian scrambles. Bud tackles him into a table, which goes down. A chair breaks. Bud lands a thunderous hook and Lucian's nose shatters. Another and his cheekbone caves. \nLucian drops like a rock. Tries to crawl under another table. IN A MANIACAL RAGE, Bud flips the table and stomps down on Lucian with furious blows that come one after another. \nLucian tries to cover up. BUD IS ALL OVER HIM. Grabs Lucian by the throat and presses down. \nLucian, fighting to breathe, digs his nails into Bud's face, tearing skin. \nBud's face twists with hate as he chokes the life out of him. \nLucian's eyes BULGE...His mouth stretches WIDE...clutching at Bud's fingers, trying to pull away... \nBud SNORTS, tightens his grip... bearing down... And at the last moment, the cop in him reemerges... \nBud lets go. \nLucian rolls to his side and coughs up a thick ribbon of blood and vomit. Bud slams on restraints. \nBud staggers to his feet...breathing hard...Spots Jesse on the floor...And he slows... \nJesse lies in shadow. Perfectly still. We cannot see his face. Only the dark pool of blood around him. \nLucian passes out. \nBUD (into radio) I got him... I got Lucian. \nSLOWLY PULL AWAY AND TRACK OVER THE MASSACRE... \n...as POLICE come in...over bodies and blood and guns, and up the stairs and out a broken window, to the CROWDS in the street held back by POLICE, past flashing lights and emergency vehicles... \n...to where life goes on in New Orleans. \nDIP TO BLACK. \n", "test3_id": 56}

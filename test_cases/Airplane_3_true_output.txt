STRIKER After the war, I just wanted to get as far away from things as possible. So Elaine and I joined the Peace Corps. We were assigned to an isolated tribe, the Molombos.

EXT. AFRICAN VILLAGE - DAY 
Striker and Elaine are being escorted to the chief's hut by two GUARDS. We hear Jungle Animal SOUNDS. The chief is standing in front of his hut surrounded by several TRIBESMEN who are making the jungle animal sounds. 
STRIKER (v.o.) They had never seen Americans before. 
When Striker and Elaine arrive, the CHIEF holds up his hands and the sounds stop. 
STRIKER (v.o.) At first, they didn't know what to think of us; but soon we gained their trust. 
The Chief extends his right hand for conventional handshake. Striker shows him power grip. When the Chief is pleased, Striker gives him five. The Chief pauses then decks Striker. 
STRIKER (v.o.) It really was a challenge during the year introducing them to our Western culture.

EXT. JUNGLE - ANOTHER AREA - DAY 
Elaine is having a Supperware party for native women. 
ELAINE Also, Supperware products are ideal for storing leftovers to help stretch your food dollar. This two quart "Seals-M-Rite" container with a special "Close-M-Tite" lid keeps hotdog buns fresh for days and prevents sugared cereals from sticking. 
She scoops a ladle of corn mush from a carved wooden bowl into a Supperware container. 
ELAINE Meat and dairy products are protected against unwanted refrigerator odors when sealed in this non-slip pastel colored "Freez-o-leer". 
When she burps the lid, the Supperware makes a human burp SOUND. 
EXT. JUNGLE - ANOTHER AREA - DAY 
Striker nailing crude basketball rim and net to tree. 
STRIKER (v.o.) You must understand that these people had been completely isolated from civilization. 
Striker demonstrates a two-handed set shot to natives. He misses. 
STRIKER (v.o.) No one had ever outlined a physical fitness program for them and they had no athletic equipment. 
Native examines basketball for first time. After two slow dribbles, he gracefully feints lefts, then, dribbling through his legs, sinks a two-hand, over-the-head, reverse dunk shot. 
STRIKER (v.o.) We also emphasized nutrition and taught them to watch their diets. 
Another native hits a long jump shot. 
STRIKER (v.o.) The exercise improved their physical fitness and condition. 
One shot after another swishes through the basketball rim. 
STRIKER (v.o.) My working with them seemed to reinforce our objectives of group cooperation and controlled-competitive activity. 
Striker approaches Elaine who is standing on the sideline. As they talk, the natives are passing the ball around and shooting baskets Harlem Globetrotter fashion. 
STRIKER I think they're getting the hang of it! When we re-enlist I'll teach them baseball! 
ELAINE Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war. 
STRIKER A lot of people made plans before the war. Like George Zipp. 
Elaine walks away, dejectedly. CAMERA STAYS with Striker as he pours Gator-Ade into a glass. 
STRIKER (v.o.) I guess it was at that moment that I first realized Elaine had doubts about our relationship. And that as much as anything else led to my drinking problem. 
Striker has a problem drinking. He raises his glass of Gator-Ade, then suddenly pours it on his forehead.

INT. PASSENGER CABIN - NIGHT 
STRIKER We did come back to the States. I tried a number of jobs...Well, I could go on for hours, but I'd probably start to bore you. 
The Japanese General is kneeling on the seat committing Hari Kari. 
STRIKER You know, I really couldn't blame Elaine. She wanted a career. I was offered a job at Boeing but I couldn't bring myself to take it...

THUNDER and lightning.

INT. UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN GYM - AFTERNOON 
DAVE SCHULTZ (31, bearded, intelligent, 163 lbs., strong, fierce, but calm), Head Coach of U of W wrestling, stands on the wrestling mat speaking VERY QUIETLY with 3 or 4 select WRESTLERS from the team. We can't quite hear what Dave is saying to them, but we can sense immediately the reverence and deep respect they have for Dave - one of the country's top wrestlers and great coaches. 
The scene gives off the feeling one might have watching a horse whisperer with a small group of stallions. Whatever he's saying, they are calmed by him, pay absolute attention, will do whatever he asks.

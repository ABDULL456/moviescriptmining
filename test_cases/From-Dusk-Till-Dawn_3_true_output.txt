BORDER GUARD What was that? 
JACOB Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom. 
BORDER GUARD You said it was just you and your son. 
JACOB I meant me, my son and my daughter. 
CLOSE-UP BORDER GUARD 
BORDER GUARD Open the door. I'm coming aboard. 
BACK TO BATHROOM 
CLOSE-UP KATE 
We can only see Kate's face. It's scared. We hear rustling around the bathroom, but we don't know what it is. 
Then it's quiet. Then we hear talking outside the door, but we can't make it out. Then we hear a knock. 
KATE I'm in the bathroom. 
BORDER GUARD (O.S.) It's the Border Patrol. Open up. 
KATE It's open. 
We hear the door open and see the light change on Kate's face. She's looking up. 
BORDER GUARD in the doorway looking in. 
HE SEES: Kate by herself, pants around her ankles, sitting on the toilet. 
KATE Do you mind? Shut the fucking door. 
BORDER GUARD Excuse me. 
He closes the door. Kate lets out a breath. We wait a beat, Seth pulls back the curtain in the shower, we see Richie on the floor of the shower knocked out. 
Seth and Kate meet eyes. 
He gives her the O.K. signal. 
CUT TO: 
BACK WINDOW MOTOR HOME 
We see through the back window of the motor home, the border getting smaller as we drive away from it. 
Scott knocks on the bathroom door. 
SCOTT It's clear. 
Seth BURSTS out of the bathroom. 
SETH Goddamn, that was. intense! 
Seth goes to the back window. He sees the border getting farther and farther away. No cars following. 
SETH (to himself) We did it. (pause) We're in Mexico. 
Seth throws his head back and SCREAMS for joy. 
Kate, emerging from the bathroom, reacts to Seth's scream, along with Scott. 
Seth is so happy that he does a little jig in the back of the van. 
Everybody else is still tense as shit. But Seth lets go of all his tension, and becomes a new man before our eyes. He turns to Kate. 
SETH (loud and happy) Come here, Kate! 
Kate, nervous, takes a step back.

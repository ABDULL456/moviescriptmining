GA ND ALF (c on t'd ) (quietly) Now, listen carefully. Lord Denethor is Boromir's father. To give him news of his beloved son's death would be most unwise ... And do not mention Frodo . . . Or the Ring . . . And say nothing of Aragorn either. (hesitates) In fact, it's better if you don't speak at all, Pippin Took. 
CLOSE ON: PIPPIN, suitably chastened, nods. 
INT. MINAS TIRITH TOWER HALL - DAY 
ANGLE ON: A LONG SOLEMN HALL ... with ROWS OF BLACK MARBLE PILLARS. Between the pillars stand a silent company of TALL KINGS carved in cold STONE. 
GANDALF strides down the HALL, with PIPPIN following obediently behind. 
At the FAR END, upon a DAIS OF MANY STEPS, sits a LARGE, EMPTY THRONE . . . and on the wall behind is the IMAGE of a FLOWERING WHITE TREE set in GEMS. 
At the FOOT of the DAIS, in a small STONE CHAIR, sits an OLD MAN, gazing at his lap: DENETHOR - the Lord Steward of CONDOR. 
GANDALF Hail, Denethor, Son of Ecthelion, Lord and Steward of Gondor. 
DENETHOR does not look up as GANDALF and PIPPIN approach. 
GANDALF (cont'd) I come with tidings in this dark hour - and with counsel. 
DENETHOR slowly raises COLD EYES . . . 
DENETHOR (bitter) Perhaps you come to explain this?

Final Revision - October, 2003 31. CONTINUED: 
DENETHOR holds up BOROMIR'S BROKEN HORN ... 
DEN ETH OR (c ont 'd ) Perhaps you come to tell me why my son is dead? 
CLOSE ON: PIPPIN remembering . . . 
INSERT IMAGE: BOROMIR, as URUK-HAI arrows thud into his body, he falls to his KNEES . . . 
PIPPIN starts forward unable to say nothing . . . 
.. PIPPIN Boromir died to save us . . . my kinsman and me . . . he fell, defending us from many foes. 
CLOSE ON: DENETHOR pain flickers in his eyes. 
GANDALF (hurried whisper) Pippin! 
PIPPIN drops to his knee offering DENETHOR his SWORD . . .

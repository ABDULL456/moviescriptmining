INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE ERIN'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 
Matt and Katie sit on the cheap plastic chairs outside the room.  Katie is holding Beth, who's sleeping. 
GEORGE (O.S.) They can stay at my place till you go home. 
INT. ERIN'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 
Erin's in bed, hooked up to an IV, looking exhausted.  All untouched food tray is beside her bed.  George is standing across the room from her, arms crossed tight across his chest, keeping his distance. 
ERIN They said that'd be tomorrow.  They just wanna keep an eye on me another night. 
GEORGE Fine.  I'll drop 'em off tomorrow afternoon. 
A moment of thick silence. 
ERIN Thank you. 
GEORGE (giving nothing) Mm-hm. 
As she watches him reach for his motorcycle helmet, to leave, she's hit with a wave of regret. 
ERIN George, hang on. (he pauses) Look ... I'm sorry.  I just -- 
There's a KNOCK at the door, and Ed enters.  George looks at him.  Not interested in her apologies. 
GEORGE I'll drop 'em by tomorrow. 
And Erin watches George leave the room, then turns to Ed. 
ERIN If you're here to fire me, your timing's lousy. 
ED I'm not gonna fire you. (beat) I wanted to.  But then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit. (serious) You embarrassed me, Erin. 
ERIN I know.  I'm sorry. (beat) Do I get to hear what happened anyway? 
INT. ERIN'S HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER 
Ed has taken off his coat and pulled a chair up next to Erin's bed.  He's eating the pudding off her tray. 
ERIN Between 50 and 400 million, definitely? 
ED Uh-huh. 
ERIN And if you had to guess ... 
ED With nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the lower end of that.  Still a lot of money. 
ERIN So why would PG&E offer it? 
ED Because.  They know the evidence; they know they're gonna lose a jury trial.  Maybe they wouldn't lose 400 million bucks, but once you factor in all they'd spend on this case in the next ten years, it makes a lot of -- 
ERIN Wait, what do you mean, ten years? 
ED Five years, maybe, for a trial.  Double that for the appeal. 
ERIN (confused) I'm sorry, are you saying that if this thing goes to trial, it'll be ten years before these plaintiffs see their money? 
ED Hey, that's not so bad.  Compare it to the Love Canal -- that was twenty years ago, and those people still haven't seen a dime.  So in legal terms, ten years is -- 
ERIN Fuck legal terms.  We're talking about human beings here.  Sick people.  A whole bunch of them are gonna be dead in ten years.  They need their money now! (beat) We gotta get 'em to agree to the arbitration, Ed.  We gotta get every damn one of those plaintiffs to -- 
ED I know.  We're having a meeting, it's all set up -- 
ERIN When?  Where? 
ED Tuesday at seven, at the Hinkley firehouse. 
ERIN Okay, good.  I think I should be the one to tell 'em, cause they trust me more than -- 
ED You're not gonna be there. 
ERIN The fuck I'm not.  I don't care what the doctor says -- 
ED This isn't doctor's orders.  It's mine.  I'm saying you can't come. 
ERIN Why not? 
ED Because Kurt doesn't want to work with you. He thinks you're a loose cannon. 
ERIN Fuck Kurt. 
ED Erin -- 
ERIN No, I'm serious.  You know what Kurt Potter is?  He's the kind of guy who never would have taken this case in the first place. He's the kind of guy who would have sold these plaintiffs down the river when PG&E offered 20 million.  He doesn't work like us, Ed.  There's no little voice in his head telling him to do the right thing. 
But his mind's made up.  He stands to leave. 
ED Don't come, Erin.  I mean it.  If you do, I'm gonna have to fire you. (beat) Just ... concentrate on getting well. 
EXT. HINKLEY FIREHOUSE - NIGHT 
The parking lot is empty, except for three Mercedes.  Ed, Potter, and Theresa are in the doorway, going over their notes.  A TRUCK pulls into the lot. 
INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MAIN ROOM - NIGHT 
Katie and Matt are watching TV.  Beth is playing near them. Behind them, Erin is lying on the couch, under a blanket, distractedly trying to watch TV.  She checks her watch. 
EXT. HINKLEY FIREHOUSE - NIGHT 
The lot is filling with more cars and trucks; headlights criss-cross each other as people pull in from all directions.

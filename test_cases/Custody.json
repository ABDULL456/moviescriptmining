Blue jeans, work boots, a ball cap and leather jacket complete his attire. He snacks on a bag of popcorn. The CRACK of the bat and the CROWD is on their feet. A BALL PLAYER slides safely into second with a double. JOHN SILVERSTEIN, thirty-three, business clad, talks on his cell phone. Calm and collected he appears unaffected by the cheering crowd. The sits with the crowd. \nRICK Helluva talent, that kid. \nJohn flashes a quick grin, never missing a beat in his phone call. \nRICK Probably be in the bigs in another year. \nJohn nods, smiles and turns away from Rick to continue uninterrupted. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

Not today. \nZACH I don't want to go. Melanie hastily dresses her son. \nMELANIE Zach, do you want mommy to get fired? \nZACH Yes. \nMELANIE If I get fired we won't have the money to go to Six Flags. Zach quickly dresses himself. CUT TO: \nEXT. AKRON'S CANAL PARK - DAY \nJohn still talks on his cell. \nRICK Must be something to have that kind of talent. He's just a kid, nineteen, twenty tops, and if he stays healthy and he stays focused, the world is his oyster. Guys like you and me, we squandered those opportunities long ago. \nJohn ends his call and turns back to Rick. \nJOHN You. \nRICK Huh? JOHN Guys like you... \nRICK And me... \nJOHN ... squandered opportunities. I, on the other hand, knew where I was going. I had that kind of drive, I just never had the talent. \nRICK You knew where you were going? \nJOHN Absolutely. \nRICK At nineteen? \nJOHN Without question. \nRICK The only thing I knew for certain was that I would run to the corner store every day for beer. \nCUT TO: EXT. DAIRY MART - DAY \nMelanie pulls into a parking space and turns the car off. \nMelanie and Zach stand at the counter. The CLERK rings them out. Zach grabs the bottle from the counter. \nZACH I want Sobe. \nMelanie snatches the bottle back. \nMELANIE Too bad. \nAn impatient LINE OF CUSTOMERS waits. \nZACH I don't want Coke. I want Sobe. \nMelanie puts the bottle back on the counter. \nMELANIE (To clerk.) We'll take the soda. \nZach stomps his feet. \nCLERK Two dollars and... MELANIE Hold on a minute.

I parked in the deck. \nJOHN I'm right around the... \nRICK Corner? \nJOHN Yeah. \nRICK We're always going in different directions. JOHN Mine are much more productive. \nRICK And much less adventurous. \nJOHN Well, I'm gonna... \nRICK Go? \nJOHN Yeah. \nRICK Then go. \nJOHN That's what I'm going to do. Responsibility calls. John turns and heads south. Rick takes a bite of popcorn, looks to the sky for a moment, grins, and heads off Northeast. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MELANIE'S CAR - DAY \nZach takes a long swig of Sobe. \nZACH Sobe sucks. I want Coke. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MAIN STREET - AKRON OHIO - DAY \nRick steps forward and the lights dim on the other four. Caught in the spotlight, Rick squints from the brightness. The lady in black shifts in her seat. A long beat. \nLADY IN BLACK That's him. \nDETECTIVE JOHNSON You're positive? \nLADY IN BLACK I'm positive. That's the man that needs to be in custody. \nThe detective keys his microphone once again. \nDETECTIVE JOHNSON Okay number three step back. Rick does as he's told. DETECTIVE JOHNSON Turn to your right --- all of you... \nThe group follows the detective's instruction. \nDETECTIVE JOHNSON ...and exit. \nOne by one the men filter through the door. Rick EXITS. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. THEATER - CONTINUOUS \nRick ENTERS on stage. The entire theater is cast in shades of gray. The stage is barren. There is no audience. He looks around for a moment and as he reaches center stage is once again flooded with the spotlight. Rick uses his arm to shade his eyes. SFX: A SOFT DIN OF VOICES. Looking stage left Rick realizes TWELVE JURORS have appeared in their box. A small AUDIENCE has congregated. SFX: THE DIN SWELLS TO A QUIET CHAOS. A RAPPING of a gavel and Rick's attention swings to a white haired JUDGE (70's). \nJUDGE Order in the court. \nThe noise level wanes, but not completely. Another RAP of the gavel. \nJUDGE Order in the court, I say. \nFocused on the Judge, Rick doesn't notice THE PROSECUTOR approaching from stage right. \nCarrying a folding chair in one hand, notes and manila folders in the other, he sets the chair behind Rick. \nPROSECUTOR Have a seat. \nJUDGE Do you know why you're here today, Mr. Stevens? \nRICK Why am I here? \nJUDGE Are you being rhetorical? \nRICK Are you asking me? \nJUDGE You stand here today an accused man. \nRICK Accused? Accused of what? \nJUDGE You have been placed in custody of your children. \nRICK Huh? \nPROSECUTOR Your children, Mr. Stevens. You do realize you have children, don't you? \nRICK Yes, but... \nPROSECUTOR But nothing Mr. Stevens, either you have children or you don't. \nRICK I do. \nPROSECUTOR So, you accept responsibility for bringing young life into the world? \nRICK I guess... \nPROSECUTOR There's no guessing, Mr. Stevens, either you're responsible for siring offspring or you aren't. \nRICK I am, but I'm not sure it was responsible. \nPROSECUTOR A crime of passion, Mr. Stevens? How convenient. (A beat) And you accept the consequences of said actions? RICK Why am I here? \nPROSECUTOR Why are you here, Mr. Stevens? Why are you here? I'll tell you why you're here. Are you familiar with Ms. Cynthia Stevens? \nRICK Yeah, she's my wife. \nPROSECUTOR Was your wife, Sir. Was your wife. She recently filed for divorce. Were you aware of that? \nMRS. NELSON Lots of single parents are married. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SUMMIT COUNTY JAIL - CELL \nRick sits alone, his head hung low. A JAILER, (40's) approaches leading THREE YOUNG CHILDREN to the cell. KRIS, (8), is followed by PHILLIP, (6), and NICHOLAS, (4). The door swings open. The children run to their father. \nKRIS Daddy! \nRICK Hi guys. \nPHILLIP I love you daddy. \nRICK I love you too, Phillip. \nNICHOLAS I love you more. \nRICK I love you more. \nNICHOLAS I love YOU more. \nKRIS Daddy, how come you're in jail? \nPHILLIP Is this where we live? \nKRIS When can we see mommy? \nRICK Come here guys.

KRIS Is she okay? \nRICK She's kind of mad at daddy. \nNICHOLAS Mommy mad at me too? \nRICK No, baby, not at all. Your mom needs time to work through some things. So, for awhile, it's just going to be us... \nKRIS What's she need time for? \nRICK To figure out who she is, where she's going, what she wants. \nNICHOLAS I miss mommy. \nRICK She misses you too, baby. And this isn't permanent... we're going to fight this... we're going to appeal. We'll take it to the Supreme Court if we have to. KRIS You don't want us either? \nRICK Of course I want you. I just don't think I should have to do this alone. \nThe jailer still lingers in the doorway, leaning against the bars. \nJAILER I feel for you, I really do, but I've seen your kind before. You're a lifer. Whether it's fair or not. Whether justice was served. It doesn't matter. You're here for the duration. \nThe boys cling to their father. The CLANK of the door being closed. The Jailer WHISTLES a sad spiritual as he walks away. CUT TO: \nINT. MELANIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nMelanie sits on her couch and cries.

FRANK RYAN'S OFFICE - DAY \nRick sits across the desk from FRANK RYAN, (40): An uncouth Italian man who seems content to stuff his face with a submarine sandwich and speak through his mastication. FRANK So, needless to say, I understand your situation. My old lady, she took off and left me with the kids five years ago. That bitch. But I'm not bitter or anything. I found me a good day care and moved on with my life.

HOSPITAL EMERGENCY AREA \nPhillip runs down the hall with a huge butterfly bandage on his head. He stops to chat with all the NURSES. Rick walks a few steps behind carrying his coat. The doctor hurries to catch up with Rick. \nRICK Look I'm really sorry. \nDOCTOR Can I ask you something? \nRick shifts uncomfortably. \nRICK Sure, I guess. \nDOCTOR My son's a wuss. He cries over hangnails. My wife and I have tried everything to toughen him up, but nothing works. I was wondering if our kids could play together.

How am I suppose to raise three kids? \nMOTHER It can be done. \nRICK I don't see how. \nMOTHER Find a way. Everything happens for a reason. God doesn't abandon his children, and neither will you. \nRICK God doesn't pay day-care. \nMOTHER There are other things out there... less expensive ways. \nRICK Could you watch them? \nMOTHER Oh... uh... well... I don't think your father is willing to do that. We raised our kids, Rick. \nRICK How `bout tonight, so I can catch a breath? \nMOTHER What?

He never abandons his children. \nRick's mom reaches in her purse and pulls some bills from her wallet. \nZACH How old? \nRICK Older than dirt. When I was a kid we didn't have dirt. We had rocks and we had hammers. If we wanted dirt we banged a few rocks with really big hammers, and then we had dirt. \nMELANIE Worked the chain gangs? \nZACH You're too old for my mom. \nKris and Phillip who have been sitting in the corner realize they have visitors and spring to greet them. \nRICK This is Kristian.

Melanie moves towards the boys. \nMELANIE I'm going to go talk to them for a little bit. I'll let you know. \nMelanie crouches to the boy's level. They appear to take a real shine to her.

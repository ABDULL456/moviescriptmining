Pete pulls himself up. 
PETE Who is it? 
CLAIRE He won't give his name. 
Pete walks slowly inside - stares at the phone and picks it up. 
PETE Hello. 
MR. EDDY (phone voice) Hey, Pete... How ya doin'? 
PETE Who is this? 
MR. EDDY You know who it is. 
Bill and Claire have stopped in the living room - watching Pete.  Pete is going crazy with Mr. Eddy on one end, and his parents staring at him on the other.  He waves his parents away, but they leave slowly and reluctantly. 
PETE Mr. Eddy? 
MR. EDDY Yeah... How ya doin', Pete? 
PETE Okay. 
MR. EDDY You're doin, okay?  That's good, Pete. 
PETE Look... It's late, Mr. Eddy... I ... 
MR. EDDY I'm really glad you're doin' okay, Pete. 
Pete doesn't know what to say. 
MR. EDDY You sure you're doin' okay? Everything all right? 
PETE Yeah. 
MR. EDDY That's good, Pete.  Hey... I want you to talk to a friend of mine. 
Pete can hear the phone being handed over to someone.  There is a long silence.  Pete can hear breathing. 
VOICE We've met before, haven't we? 
Pete freezes.  His mind is scrambling. 
PETE I don't think so.  Where was it that you think we've met? 
VOICE At your house.  Don't you remember? 
PETE No. No, I don't. 
VOICE We just killed a couple of people... 
PETE What? 
Pete can hear Mr. Eddy laugh in the background. 
VOICE You heard me... We thought we'd come over and tell you about it. 
Pete is getting pale with fear. 
PETE What's goin' on? 
VOICE Great question!! In the east ... the far east... when a person is sentenced to death... they're sent to a place where they can't escape... never knowing when an executioner will step up behind them and fire a bullet into the back of their head... it could be days... weeks... or even years after the death sentence has been pronounced... This uncertainty adds an exquisite element of torture to the situation, don't you think?  It's been a pleasure talking to you. 
Pete can hear the phone being passed again. 
MR. EDDY Pete... I just wanted to jump on and tell you I'm really glad you're doin' okay. 
The phone goes dead and Pete sits - fearfully pondering his fate.  He hears a NOISE and turns. 
Down at the far end of the hall he sees his parents staring at him. 
CLOSE UP ON PARENTS staring in the direction of the living room as if sensing something, but not seeing. 
PARENTS POV - The hall and living room beyond.  There is no one there. 
DISSOLVE TO:

A City Bus pulls up to the stop.  The doors open and Pete climbs on. 
CUT TO:

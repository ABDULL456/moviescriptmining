MRS. FORD Did you bring all those niggers? Two of them? You got two? 
FORD Make me something to eat, dear. The day has taken it from me. 
MRS. FORD Let me get a look at them... 
FORD Mr. Chapin-- 
MRS. FORD 
(RE: ELIZA) This one's cryin'. Why is this one cryin'?

MRS. FORD 
(TO ELIZA:) Something to eat and some rest; your children will soon enough be forgotten.

EXT. FORD'S WORK AREA - DAY 
John Tibeats, stands before the slaves. Chapin hovers to one side. 
TIBEATS My name is John Tibeats, William Ford's chief carpenter. You will refer to me as Master. Tibeats nods in Chapin's direction: 
TIBEATS (CONT'D) Mister Chapin is the overseer on this plantation. He is responsible for all of Ford's property. You too will refer to him as Master. This plantation covers many hundreds of acres, and you will traverse the Texas road between the forest site and the sawmill in double time. Any clever nigger on that path that gets a little lightfooted, I will remind him that on one side men and bloodhounds patrol the border and on the other the bayou provides a hard living, with alligators and little to eat or drink that won't kill you. No slave has escaped here with his life. You're here to work niggers, so let's commence. Tibeats begins to sing the song "Run Nigger, Run" mockingly. We cut to Solomon chopping logs and into the montage of the slaves doing manual labor and arriving back to the sawmill. Lyrics for "Run Nigger, Run"

61 EXT. WOODS - DAY 61 
-END OF MAY THROUGH EARLY JUNE, 1841- We are in a wooded area. There is A GANG OF SLAVES chopping trees into timber. It is hard, laborious work made no more easy by the sweltering heat. Solomon is among them as well as Sam. 
EXT. WOODS - LATER 
The slaves now load the timber onto a horse drawn wagon. Again, hard work done under the ever present sun. 
42B. 
63 EXT. ROAD - LATER 63 
As Sam drives the wagon, the other slaves trudge along side by foot. We should get the sense the travel is long and tedious. 
64 EXT. FORD'S WORK AREA - LATER 64 
It is a sizable work area on the edge of Indian Creek. There is much work being done, the slaves primarily employed in piling the timber and chopping it into lumber. As before, there is little doubt about the rigors of the job at hand. Working as a carpenter at the work area is JOHN TIBEATS. There are also various CUSTOMERS who move about placing orders. 
EXT. FORD PLANTATION - DAY 
-EARLY TO MID JUNE, 1841- It's Sunday morning. All of Ford's slaves are dressed with their "finest" clothes - brightly colored and as free as possible of defect. The slaves are gathered on

MARGE How about a skyhook? 
DOUG You sail your boat, I'll sail mine. 
A fin rises partially, almost invisible to most of the kids, but Mike notices it, believing it to be a porpoise. 
MIKE Hey, Fetterman -- You got company. 
DOUG Company? The place is a mess... 
Before anyone can react, the shape rises behind Doug, striking his raft a terrible blow. 
DOUG Whoops. 
CUT TO: 
THE OTHERS, WATCHING 
Not making any headway themselves, they casually watch the class clown, wondering what he's up to this time. 
DOUG'S BOAT 
a distance from the rest. It shakes, then blows up as big teeth grip it from below. Doug goes flying into the drink. 
The Shark has the inflatable in his teeth, and is shaking it from side to side. Doug's eyes bug out as he sees what's going on. He begins treading water, backing away as fast as he can, waving his arm in the air frantically -- "pick me up, quick..." 
MIKE'S BOAT 
MIKE Doug's down! 
He sails to where Doug is being carried along by the current. 
The inflatable is a mess -- shredded rubber and dead engine; the Shark didn't like it. 
ANDY Doug! This way! 
Doug carefully -- oh, so carefully -- strokes over to where Mike and Andy can pull him abroad. Some of the others sail closer to get a look. 
PATRICK What was that about? 
MARGE You okay? 
LUCY What was that? 
LARRY So much for the rubber duck. 
THE GROUP, DRIFTING TOGETHER 
This incident hasn't yet touched them -- no one actually saw what it was, except Doug, who's never been serious about anything. Until now. 
DOUG A shark ate my boat. 
BOB Come on. 
DOUG I'm telling you, a goddamn shark ate my goddamn boat! 
ANDY If he liked your boat, I got some sneakers he'll love. 
There's nervous laughter from all around as they examine the remains of Doug's inflatable. Some of those jagged rents could be made by teeth... 
KIDS (ad lib) ...Jeez -- what did that?... A porpoise, maybe...Nah, killer whale... I think he snagged it... I hate to pop his balloon... (Etc.) 
ANGLE ON MIKE'S BOAT 
Doug's inflatable is draped over the tip of one hull, forward. 
Without warning, the Shark hits. Screams, terror, confusion. 
Mike, Andy, Jackie into the water. 
CLOSE ON MIKE 
His head bangs on a metal fitting as the boat turns over. 
ON THE GROUP 
Patrick and Lucy ram into Timmy's boat, locking into it, knocking Timmy into the water as Brooke screams. 
CONFUSION 
As the following events take place: 
--  Larry's red cat rams and locks onto Mike's Tornado. 
--  Marge's boat capsizes, putting Sean and Marge into the drink. 
--  Marge scrambles up on the over-turned hull, pulling Sean up with her, just in time. 
--  Polo, under full sail, scoops Mike out of the water before the Shark can get to him. 
--  The Shark dips out of sight. 
SURFACE, WIDE OVER THE STERN OF POLO'S BOAT 
showing the results of the turmoil: 
ANGLE ON THE SURVIVORS 
As they make ineffectual, frightened moves towards grouping together, Andy is the first to gain any composure. 
ANDY Raft up! Raft 'em up! 
He reaches towards a drifting line, and pulls Timmy's Doughdish towards them, tying it off as it comes close. 
LARRY Tie off to your strongest point. 
PATRICK Anyone need an extra line? 
Polo has Mike and Timmy aboard his boat.  Timmy is looking up from examining Mike's dazed body.

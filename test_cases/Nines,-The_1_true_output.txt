MELISSA (ON TAPE) I understand. It's not your fault. You're morally incapable of doing the right thing. 
Noelle REWINDS further.    Blocky pixels RUSH PAST as we... 
CUT TO: 
EXT.   FOREST - DAY 
Sierra continues to lead the way. She seems confident where she's headed, even though there's no real path. 
During the conversation, we notice a small tattoo on her right shoulder blade: IX. 
SIERRA So you play a lot of characters at once? 
GABRIEL A couple.    Most people do. 
SIERRA You're not most people. You created the world. You know all the secret codes. 
GABRIEL What, like `God mode'? 
SIERRA That's what you call it? 
GABRIEL That's when you have all the powers, and you can't be killed. It's fine when you're designing, but it's really boring to play. A game isn't fun unless there are rules. 
SIERRA And you make the rules. 
GABRIEL Yes I do. I mean, you want to give everyone freedom, but they can't handle it. Half your players are teenage boys, and it's like they're programmed to be destructive. (MORE) 
GABRIEL (CONT'D) They deliberately crash the world servers. They'd ruin everything just to prove they could.

Sarah offers Gary her water bottle, which he gladly takes. 
Out of nowhere... 
SIERRA Do you think I'm pretty? 
She stops, turning to face him. 
GABRIEL What? 
SIERRA Do you think I'm hot?   On a purely physical level. 
GABRIEL Sure. 
He drinks. 
SIERRA That's a rave. 
GABRIEL Well, I don't know why you're asking. 
SIERRA My ex-boyfriend, the orc, he says, "What I like about you is that you're not so hot that I'm afraid of losing you." 
GABRIEL So where's the orc now? 
SIERRA He's dead. I spiked his water bottle with a massive quantity of GHB. He hallucinated, went into convulsions and died. 
He screws the cap back on the water bottle and hands it back. 
GABRIEL Remind me not to piss you off, Sarah. 
SIERRA Sierra. 
He's surprised.    He could have sworn her name was Sarah. 
GABRIEL Sorry. 
SIERRA And what makes you think you haven't pissed me off already? 
She smiles, keeps walking. 
EXT. ROAD / INT. PRIUS - DAY 
Mary sits down in the front passenger seat of the car. Noelle is still in back, watching footage on the video camera. 
MARY How are you doing, kiddo?

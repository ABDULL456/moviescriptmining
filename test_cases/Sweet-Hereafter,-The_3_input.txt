Around the practising band, various carpenters and technicians are making final preparations for that evening's big event. 
One of the people watching the band is SAM BURNELL, a man in his early forties.  He watches his daughter, NICOLE, as she sings into the microphone.  NICOLE is sixteen. 
NICOLE stares at her father as she sings. 
ANGLE ON 
SAM looking back at his daughter.  He is intensely proud of her.  SAM is a carpenter, working on at the fair site.  He gets back to his work, hammering a supporting beam into the grandstand. 
CUT TO 
INT. AIRPORT. WASHROOM -- AFTERNOON 
CLOSE UP of a three year old girl, staring up into the lens. Her face is full of sweetness and trust. 
ANGLE ON 
MITCHELL STEPHENS in a crowded airport washroom, watching a young father, PETER, trying to change the diaper on his three year old daughter. 
MITCHELL stares at the little girl, his face registering a wistful smile.  PETER is having a hard time trying to find the towel from the toddler's bag and keeping an eye on her at the same time. 
MITCHELL Need a hand? 
PETER Sure, it you could find a towel in this bag.  I know my wife packed one in there... 
MITCHELL comes forward and searches through the toddler's bag. 
MITCHELL You always think you're prepared for these things. 
PETER Tell me about it. 
MITCHELL How old is she? 
PETER Almost three. 
MITCHELL (finding a towel) Is this it? 
PETER Perfect. 
MITCHELL Here we go. 
PETER Thanks. 
PETER lays the towel across the counter, and dries the little girl.  MITCHELL watches as PETER puts a new diaper on her.  The toddler stares up at MITCHELL, her eyes are playful. 
MITCHELL stares at the girl's face. 
CUT TO 
INT. CAR WASH. -- NIGHT 
TIME CUT back to MITCHELL honking the horn of his car, trying to get someone's attention.  No response.  MITCHELL picks up his cell phone, and dials the operator. 
MITCHELL Yes, operator, I'm in a strange situation.  I'm calling from my car, and I appear to be stuck in a car wash...A car wash, yes...Is there anyway you could...Hello?...Hello?... 
The line has died. 
MITCHELL searches for an umbrella, finds one, and tries to get out of the car without getting soaked. 
ANGLE ON 
MITCHELL as he leaves the car, trying to protect himself from the onslaught of water with his umbrella.  He is immediately soaked by a large mop.  The camera watches MITCHELL as he makes his way towards light at the end of the wash. 
CUT TO 
INT. CAR WASH. -- NIGHT 
MITCHELL walks into the office of the car wash.  No one is there.  There is an ominous buzz coming from another room. 
MITCHELL moves towards the garage of the car wash/auto repair establishment.  He moves into a larger room, full of discarded auto parts.  The buzzing noise is coming from an electric guitar, which has been left on, and is on the verge of screeching feedback.

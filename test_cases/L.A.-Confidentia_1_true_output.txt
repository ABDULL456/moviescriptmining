DUDLEY Sergeant, we'll get right to it. Nine civilian witnesses have identified you as hitting Ezekiel Garcia. 
LOEW But my office has a stellar witness who will tell the grand jury that you hit back only after being hit. 
JACK What do I have to do? 
LOEW Testify against the three officers who have already earned their pensions.  Our key witness will testify roundly, but you can plead ignorance to questions directed at the other men. 
CHIEF I'll guarantee you a slap on the wrist.  A brief suspension followed by a temporary transfer from Narcotics to Ad Vice. (a beat) When you transfer out of Vice, you'll be back on the show. 
JACK The show, sir? 
CHIEF Badge of Honor, Vincennes.  We need to tone down your profile for a bit. 
The Chief just got Jack where he lives. 
DUDLEY John, I doubt you've ever drawn a stupid breath.  Don't start now. 
JACK Okay.  I'll do it. 
Smiles all around.  Loew smiles at the two-way.  A move not lost on Jack who wonders who might be on the other side. 
CHIEF Dismissed, Vincennes. 
Jack leaves.  The Chief steps to the mirror, looks through. 
CHIEF So be it.  Detective Lieutenant. 
OTHER SIDE OF GLASS 
Exley clenches his fist in victory.  The Chief continues. 
CHIEF Ace them at the grand jury tomorrow, son.  Wear the smart- looking suit and ace them.  And, Ed?  Lose the glasses. 
INT. ROOM 114 (GRAND JURY WITNESS ROOM) - DAY 
Glasses off, Exley waits, looks up as Jack enters. 
JACK You're the key witness? 
EXLEY That's right. 
JACK I should've known.  What's the Chief throwing you? 
EXLEY Throwing me? 
JACK Yeah, Exley.  What's the payoff? 
EXLEY You're the payoff expert.  I'm just doing my duty. 
JACK You're playing an angle, college boy.  You're getting something out of this so you don't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who'll hate your guts for snitching.  If they're making you a detective, watch out.  Some Bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you're gonna have to work with friends of theirs. 
EXLEY What about you? 
JACK I'm snitching three old timers who'll be fishing in Oregon next week.  Next to you I'm clean.  And smart. 
At that, a CLERK steps in from the hallway. 
CLERK Edmund J. Exley to chambers. 
As Exley's about to go... 
JACK Just remember, Bud White'll fuck you for this if it takes the rest of his life.  They already suspended him.  Just pray he cops a deal and stays on the Department because that is one civilian you do not want on your case. 
INT. TWILIGHT LOUNGE - NIGHT 
An old black guy in a frayed, threadbare tux plays piano. Bud, nursing a highball at the bar, steps over to a REDHEAD with too much make-up on too many miles. 
BUD That an old fashioned you're drinking? (as she nods) My name's Bud. 
REDHEAD Nobody was born with the name Bud. 
BUD They stick you with a name like Wendell, you look for an alias. 
REDHEAD What do you do, Bud? 
BUD I'm sorta between jobs.  Look, what do you say we, uh... 
A hand on Bud's shoulder.  He turns to see Dudley Smith. 
DUDLEY Lad, may I have a word with you? 
BUD This business, Captain? 
DUDLEY Say goodnight to your friend and join me by those back tables. 
Dudley starts off.  Bud turns back to Redhead, but she's already talking to a sailor. 
BOOTH 
Dudley sits at a table.  A newspaper is opened, a little mound underneath.  Bud joins Dudley. 
BUD Does that paper say we've been indicted?  Does it say Exley's a hero for squealing me and Stensland off? 
DUDLEY He made his play amd he got what he wanted.  They're making him a detective.

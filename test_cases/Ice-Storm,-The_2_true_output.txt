PAUL (gathering books, papers, almost talking to himself) Man, Francis, you are one drug addled elitist freak, and when the revolution comes I do not want to be lined up with you and shot, 'cause you're fucking ripe for political reeducation, you know, like in the fields. 
FRANCIS Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night? 
PAUL (spraying some chloroform mouth spray) I gotta get to English class. 
INT. ST PETERS' CLASSROOM. DAY 
An English class in progress. 
Paul Hood sits blankly, hardly listening, until he hears the teacher call out. 
TEACHER Libbets? 
LIBBETS What Dostoyevsky is saying here is that to be a Christian is to choose, because you have to choose of your own choice, but since you can't choose to be good because that would be too rational you have to choose to be bad -- it's existential. 
TEACHER Thank you Libbets, that's a very compelling summary, but -- 
Paul looks at her, smitten. Marge, Paul's friend, notices his look. 
INT. ST. PETER'S HALLWAY. DAY 
As class lets out, Paul accosts Libbets. 
PAUL Um, Libbets. Hey, Dostoyevsky, I'm also really a fan, and what you were saying, you know, have you ever read The Idiot? 
LIBBETS The Idiot? 
PAUL If you liked Notes from Underground, you'll love The Idiot. 
LIBBETS (turning to go) Great, thanks for the tip. 
PAUL (after her) The Idiot. 
INT. ST. PETER'S HALLWAY. DAY 
Paul walks with Marge. 
PAUL I'm in love with Libbets Casey. 
MARGE Yeah, well, you've been in love with like every other girl here, I was wondering when you'd get around to Libbets. 
PAUL It's beyond mere physical attraction. 
MARGE That's good, because I don't think Libbets is capable of the sex act. 
PAUL Truly? Do speak. 
MARGE My diagnosis is messed in the head. A poor little rich girl -- I mean check out the jeans and fur look. And lend your ears to this brutality. Like her mom and step dad and her step-sisters are going to Switzerland to ski over Thanksgiving break -- and like they didn't invite her! 
PAUL How do you know this shit? 
MARGE They did it last year too. It's like traditional or something. They've got this humongoid Park Ave apartment and she just holes up there with a wad of cash. (beat) Aren't the hugely wealthy sad? 
PAUL (pause) You think Francis is going to beat me to the punch here? 
MARGE Since he sleeps with every girl you ever show an interest in, why don't you just keep your Libbets thing a secret from him? 
PAUL Good thinking Marge. 
INT. SCHOOL PARTY. NIGHT 
Paul, Francis and friends enter the dark, crowded room. Various kids are awkwardly dancing to some progressive fm style undanceable rock (Jethro Tull, etc.) Francis hands Paul the tail end of a joint, but Paul waves it away. 
PAUL No more man. I'm about to drop as it is. 
FRANCIS See ya. 
PAUL Where you going? 
FRANCIS Paul, let me enlighten you about something. You and I exist on two opposite sides of a great existential divide, that being your pathetic virginity on the one hand and my astonishing number of sexual conquests on the other. I'm off to get laid. See you. 
PAUL Flame on, asshole. 
FRANCIS And remember, with your erogenous zones lubricated as such with the mighty herb, do not attempt terrestrial contact with members of the opposite sex -- because you drone on like a motherfucker when you're stoned. 
He waves his fingers toward Paul's eyes, in the classic "stoned" gesture, then wanders off. 
Paul looks on at the gathering. Marge waves to him from the dance floor.

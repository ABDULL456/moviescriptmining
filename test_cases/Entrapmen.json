{"train": "\"Entrapment\", early, by Ronald Bass \nENTRAPMENT \nRonald Bass First Draft Screenplay December 2, 1996 \nStory by: Ronald Bass and Michael Herzberg \nEXT. HANCOCK TOWER, CHICAGO - LATE NIGHT \nLake Shore Drive.  Four o'clock in the morning.  Minimal traffic, minimal life.  As MAIN TITLES BEGIN, we PAN UP the face of... \n...Hancock Tower.  Up, up, forty floors, sixty, eighty, very dark up here, street sounds fading fast, and as CREDITS CONTINUE we can just make out... \n...a dark FIGURE.  Like a spider.  Inching its way up the steel surface of the 98th floor, and we CLOSE to see... \nThe THIEF.  All in black, nearly invisible, with a sleek visored helmet that conceals the face.  Two long, oblong backpacks, climb- ing ropes and harness across back and shoulders, tools at the belt. Moving STRAIGHT UP the face of the skyscraper.  How is it possible? CLOSER still to see... \n...the piton-like BOLTS are electromagnetic, CLANKING to the steel to support weight.  A button releases the magnetic charge when the bolt is pulled up by cords to a higher position.  The Thief is remarkably strong and agile, scaling the wall with fluid precision, until... \n...our summit.  A softly-lit, glass-walled PENTHOUSE on the 100th floor.  Subtle spots which bathe paintings, sculptures, in a cavernous coldly-decorated space. \nSwiftly, deftly, the Thief rigs a suction-mounted HARNESS to the steel casing above a massive window.  Pulleys, metal caribiner clips, yellow Kevlar ropes.  So superbly practiced, the rigging is placed in seconds, huge SUCTION CUPS pressed to the surface of the glass.  The Thief reaches to a metal rectangle at the top of the rigging, touches a button, a motor WHINES, the ropes TIGHTEN and the window... \n...POPS FREE, hangs SUSPENDED by the Kevlar ropes which amazingly sustain its awesome weight.  The huge pane shudders in the wind, and the Thief slips... \n...INTO the Penthouse.  Nearby, an ALARM BOX softly BEEPS its 60-second warning to the pulsing of a green light, and the Thief attaches a small computerized DEVICE which runs a series of possible CODES at dazzling speed on its display panel, until... \n...the right one STOPS.  Illuminated in red.  The beeping, the green light, go OFF.  The device is removed. \nBack to the window, air rushing in, attach a similar suction- mounted harness from the inside, all exquisitely engineered to rig in seconds, press new suction cups to the inside of the dangling window pane.  A small remote control clicker... \n...RELEASES the outside suction cups.  The window's weight now supported by the interior rigging.  The outside equipment pulled INTO the apartment in a single tug.  The WHINE of a motor, and the pane pulls UP, the Thief expertly POPPING it into place. \nNo trace of entry. \nRapidly folding the rigging into an astonishingly compact bundle, the Thief SCANS... \n...the profusion of priceless art.  The paintings run to Otto Dix, Franz Marc, Marcel Duchamp.  One statue an obvious Rodin.  The soft lighting makes walls seem invisible, everything with an infinity perspective in mind.  An obsidian slab dining table that seems to end at the horizon. \nThe Thief has packed the rigging away, taken out a large cylin- drical TUBE bearing a label we can't read.  Knows the way, quickly through the spectacular apartment, past oils by early German expressionists, Russian futurists, a Rothko, a Kandinsky, a Francis Bacon.  The Thief has no interest in these, and as CREDITS CONTINUE, we enter... \n...a powder room.  A lime-green poured concrete sink, a copper- plated commode, and across from these... \n...a single PAINTING.  Unlike the others, clearly an Old Master. A 17th century city on the water, churches, spires, an ancient bridge.  The Thief wastes no time, unceremoniously... \n...CUTS the painting from its frame with sure, perfect strokes. Rolls it quickly in acid-free paper.  Opens the cylindrical tube, pulling out... \n...another CANVAS which we cannot see.  Deftly unrolls this, fitting it carefully into the stolen painting's now-empty frame. Re-hangs it.  Stares for a beat through the opaque helmet visor. Approves.  Slips the rolled-up stolen canvas into the empty tube. Leaves.  Before we follow, we shift angle to see the replacement canvas... \nA cheerful acrylic portrait.  Bozo the Clown. \nWITH the Thief now, moving fast, into a panelled library.  There is a CHUTE built into the wall, a brass lid with the words U.S. MAIL. The Thief pops the labeled tube DOWN the chute.  Gone.  Steps... \n...onto a bookshelf, reaches up to punch out an overhead grating, and... \nDisappears into the vent.  Reaching back to refit the grating seamlessly into place. \nINT. VENT \nHalogen flashlight leading the way, our Thief shimmies down the narrow space, arriving at... \n...an open vertical AIR SHAFT, BLASTING air straight up the 100 floor height of the skyscraper, with frightening FORCE.  Calmly, the Thief clips on a different harness, unzips a nylon cover from the backpack, and simply... \nLEAPS DOWN the air shaft, startling the shit out of us, as, for an instant... \n...the force of the updraft seems to HOLD the Thief in place, suspended above 100 stories of nothingness.  Then suddenly, the Thief... \n...DROPS SHARPLY, an exhilarating moment of absolute FREE FALL, until a cord is tugged and... \n...a nylon PARACHUTE OPENS with a pop.  We watch the Thief drifting lazily down.  A ride any kid would pay big money for... \nEXT. HANCOCK TOWER - LATE NIGHT \nOur original exterior VIEW of the skyscraper's penthouse.  REVERSE ANGLE now to see in far distance... \n...the dense forest of silhouetted OFFICE TOWERS of downtown Chicago against the night sky, and we ZOOM TOWARD them, covering miles in three seconds, to CLOSE on... \n...the highest floor of the SEARS TOWER, and THROUGH an unlit window to see... \n...a TELESCOPE.  A silhouetted FIGURE looking through it.  SNAP to... \nVIEW through the scope's lens.  An amazingly CLOSE detail of the Hancock Tower Penthouse.  The scope now PANS DOWN the length of the Tower, to... \nThe street.  The Thief climbing onto a battered old Lambretta. Calm as you please.  And as the scooter glides off... \nWe HEAR our unseen voyeur WALK AWAY from our telescope.  A door OPENS somewhere, and as CREDITS CONCLUDE, it... \nCloses.  Softly. \nINT. WEBBER ASSURANCE - DAY \nA basement corridor.  Long, bare, dimly lit.  Silent.  We're in the bowels of somewhere.  A startling CLANK, like a prison cell unlocking.  A FIGURE enters the corridor, coming this way, on the hurried side of brisk. \nHECTOR CRUZ is 42, tanned, fit, graying hair swept back in a Pat Riley do.  He wears Riley's Armani, too.  Maybe this guy coaches. Heels ECHO until he reaches a plain door with discreet lettering... \nNO ADMITTANCE FOR ANY REASON.  There is a dull silver rectangle below the words.  He holds his hand up to it... \nNothing happens.  Shit.  Dries his palm on his perfectly-creased slacks.  One more time.  CLICK.  Enters... \nINT. SITUATION ROOM - DAY \nGIN Because they couldn't do it. \nHis slow smile.  This fucking kid. \nCRUZ He's been out of the business. For ten years. \nGIN Maybe not.  No one ever proved, hell, even arrested him, for stealing anything.  But we all know he was numero ichiban for thirty years.  Why not forty? \nShe's serious. \nCRUZ Why?  Because of the Bozo switch? Guys have been copying his pack- rat signature for decades.  Maybe the thief wanted it to look like MacDougal. \nShe doesn't even answer.  Just touches her panel, and one of the data screens BLOWS UP to huge size.  It is... \nGIN A list of his private collection. Complete to three acquisitions last Thursday. \nNames SCROLLING up endlessly, next to titles, descriptions, estimated retail and black market values.  Turner, Corot, Thomas Coles, DeKooning, Klimt, Cezannes, Odilon Redon, Braques, Mary Cassatt... \nCRUZ No Vermeer.  Nothing close. \nGIN Don't be a putz.  This is his legitimate collection, which he buys.  Presentable for any search warrant surprise party. \nNames keep rolling, Degas, Paul Klee.  Amazing. \nGIN What he rips off, he fences.  And the money feeds his portfolio of investments, which are daring, savvy, and obscenely succesf... \nCRUZ Oh, I get it.  He has no interest in Vermeers, so that proves he stole one.  By that logic, he oughta be a suspect most of the time. \nShe shakes her head, sadly. \nGIN You love to embarrass yourself. \nTouches her panel.  The big screen now shows a grainy VIDEOTAPE of... \nGIN The auction.  Where our client bought the painting... \nWe see the Great Room of an English Country estate.  Perhaps a hundred attend.  Genteel to the max. \nGIN (O.S.) Ashcroft Hall, Buckinghamshire, four weeks ago. \nThe tape PANS five PAINTINGS on the block.  We recognize our VERMEER, the city of Delft, the canal, the bridge.  The view PULLS BACK to include the crowd, and... \nFREEZES.  One tiny section is circled.  And BLOWS UP twenty feet. high, so blurry as to be unrecognizable.  Then, SNAPS to amazing resolution.  The image of... \nGIN (O.S., murmur) Anyone we know? \n...ANDREW MacDOUGAL, perhaps 60, as charismatic and shamelessly virile a face as one can recall.  Etched with character and worldly experience, lit by a twinkle behind the razor-keen gaze.  Tall, wide shoulders, massive hands.  This guy would be more fun to fuck than fight.  By a lot. \nCRUZ So he was there. \nGIN Staking it out.  Why bid, when you can mark the buyer, and jack it within the month? \nShe leans WAY back in the molded chair.  Lifts her long legs up onto the console.  They end in slender bare feet.  The toes wriggle. \nGIN At this moment, he is winging on JAL flight 307 to Narita, ostensibly to attend a prestigious auction at the Hotel Akura, which will include a mixed media collage/oil by Georges Braques, on which he supposedly has his eye. \nCRUZ But you know better. \nGIN Bet your ass.  At Vegas odds. \nTouches the panel.  The big screen now holds three faces, three names. \nGIN (O.S.) Research reveals three known fences, still at large, who are believed to have brokered Vermeers to black market buyers.  Sandrine Palmer is hospitalized in Malta with ovarian cancer. \nOne face and name disappears.  Two remain.  KOICHI NARUHITO. HIROYUKI YAMAJI. \nGIN The other two.  Live in Tokyo. \nA tiny, dry, adorable, shrug.  Which says, bingo. \nCRUZ And you did all this since 4:30 this morning. \nGrinning small at each other.  She can't help that hers is hot. She never can. \nCRUZ (murmur) Plus.  You were polite to a stranger. \nOne of those moments when his attraction to her is too obvious to ignore.  Best to defuse by pretending it's a joke... \nGIN (soft and playful) Sounds like you're sorry you're already a friend. \nSaid as banter between pals.  Which doesn't make her wrong. \nINT. HOTEL OKURA, TOKYO - NIGHT \nAuction in progress in the huge traditional LOBBY, where bonsai trees, paper lanterns and elaborate painted screens counterpoint the sleek, international, big-money crowd.  Everyone milling, drinking, schmoozing, networking in a babble of languages, as up on the raised platform... \n...the AUCTIONEER has a new piece on the block, a 6th Century temple scroll, from the Asuka period.  It is exquisite, and bidding seems to be big time, from the rapidly escalating numbers on the overhead DIGITAL DISPLAY, which reveals bidding status in thirty currencies simultaneously. As we PAN the hall, we see... \n...all non-Asians either wearing headphones, or acompanied by personal translators at their elbow, to follow the rapid-fire auctioneer. \nExcept one. \nANDREW MacDOUGAL stands alone in black tie.  Tall and rugged and polished and focused, and, well, pretty gorgeous.  He is bidding on the scroll, indicated only by subtle gestures with his program and the repeated finger-stabs of the auctioneer in our direction. \nWOMAN'S VOICE (O.S., subtitled Japanese) Don't do it. \nPULL BACK slightly to reveal Gin, who has stepped to his shoulder. She is barely recognizable to us in her satiny slip of a pale golden gown that drapes her frame perfectly.  Breathtaking would be an insult. \nMacDougal doesn't turn, doesn't seem to even hear her.  Just raises his program to up the bid. \nGIN (softly, subtitled Japanese) You're already over value.  By 15 percent. \nA black chamber.  We can scarcely make out the endless rows of shelving, the air purifying equipment, the conveyor belt entering through its air lock, as machinery folds each priceless microchip in foil wrappers, stacks them on shelves.  Through the gasket... \n...Mac TUMBLES into view, swinging himself neatly DOWN to the floor, and in a single motion, he is already FLASHING a neon-green pen light along the shelves of microchips.  We see now the wrappers are different colors, with different Kanji characters, and Mac is definitely looking for something special, until... \n...he's found it.  A single row, 35 chips, nothing special from here, but Mac... \n...WHIPS out something coiled, SNAPS it to full length, revealing a strip of shiny black SATIN CLOTH.  Three feet long, little more than an inch wide.  Carefully, Mac lays the strip down directly OVER the row of microchips.  And when he lifts it UP again... \n...the chips have ADHERED to the underside of the cloth.  In one deft SNAP of his wrist, he COILS the cloth again, like a yo-yo. Turns to leave, and... \nOh, yeh. \nTosses a small SACK of something where the chips used to be.  TIM'S CASCADE BRAND POTATO CHIPS.  SEA SALT AND VINEGAR FLAVOR. \nINT. CLEAN ROOM \nMac exiting from the maintenance hatch back into the Clean Room. No one sees, no one cares.  Hooking up once again, he ambles toward a door clearly marked EXIT ONLY TO EMPLOYEE LOUNGE - RETURN ONLY THROUGH SECURITY AREA. \nBy the door is an employee notice tacked to the wall.  He pretends to scan it.  A stack of flyers.  He takes one.  Exiting into... \nINT. EMPLOYEE LOUNGE \nPast a changing area, vending machines, guys bullshitting.  Mac just strolling along, reading his flyer, as... \nA hand.  Touches his shoulder \nVOICE (subtitled Japanese) Excuse me. \nMac turns, stares through his opaque VISOR at a well-built SECURITY OFFICER.  Dead straight eyes. \nOFFICER (subtitled Japanese) The company picnic.  Saturday or Sunday? \nHis eyes cut to the flyer Mac is 'reading'.  Mac hands it to him, and without a trace of Scottish accent... \nMAC (subtitled Japanese) Better eat first. \nINT. GUEST LOBBY \nGin is up to her ears in grief.  There are no less than five COPS grilling her, taking notes, while the old couple has their second wind and are SHRIEKING in top form.  The bystander gallery has grown to maybe three dozen, and they're all getting their word in. As Gin struggles to cope... \n...she keeps looking at the clock.  Darting glances toward the corridor.  She is freaking out. \nFinally.  She can't stand it.  Hands Mac's billfold to one of the cops, pushes her way through the mob, and... \n...TAKES OFF down the corridor, a security guard in belated pursuit, we go... \n...WITH her DOWN the hallway, WHEEL around a corner, flat-out SPRINTING, SKIDS to a stop at the right doorway and BURSTS INTO... \nINT. MEN'S ROOM \nAn empty washroom.  She listens.  Nothing. \nGIN Mr. MacDougal?  Sir? \nNo sound.  Uh-oh. \nGIN Uh.  Mr. Ma... \nMAC (O.S., from the stall) Just 'Mac'.  And whatever became of a gentleman's privacy? \nThe security guard BARGES IN. \nMAC (O.S.) My God, more females? \nThe guard starts railing at Gin a mile a minute.  She calmly takes a WAD of bills from her purse.  Hands them to the guy... \nGIN (subtitled Japanese) Stand outside.  That door.  Two minutes... \nHe does.  Alone again. \nGIN I was worried, it's been twenty... \nMAC (O.S.) Eighteen, actually.  The leg is fine, but I got sort of...woozy. \nGIN Woozy. \nMAC (O.S.) Lost my stomach once or twice. \nCUT INSIDE the stall.  He is just re-taping the folded clean suit and hood to the small of his back. \nMAC I'm an old man.  You probably noticed. \nAwkward silence.  He smiles at that, much amused.  Slips on his jacket. \nMAC You should see me without my teeth. \nUNLOCKS the door.  Remembers... \nMAC Ah.  Mustn't forget to zip up. \nThat's not what he forgot.  He pulls OUT the coiled black satin cloth strip, SNAPS it free, microchips snug to the underside.  And fits it neatly... \n...DOWN his trouser leg.  The perfect tuxedo stripe. \nOUT the door.  To meet her gaze. \nMAC Odd place, this. \nHe goes to her.  Offers his arm. \nMAC What do you suppose they make here?  Video recorders? \nMAC You mean.  Not as old as I look. \nShe traces her finger along his cheek. \nGIN (a whisper) Yeh. \nAnd kisses him.  It takes awhile.  She seems to enjoy it.  With him, it's harder to tell.  When she pulls back... \n...he picks up a chocolate.  Tears it in half.  Offers her the larger piece. \nGIN Do I deserve a reward? \nNo answer.  He puts the chocolate into her mouth.  With great tenderness, he traces the line of her lower lip.  As she swallows. \nGIN It's so hard to find good casual sex, anymore.  I'm probably out of practice. \nBut he just looks at her. \nMAC What's hard to find.  Is someone you truly want to be with. \nAnd leans closer.  Just above a whisper... \nMAC Even for awhile. \nHe kisses her.  Beautiful and deep, the way he does it.  And when he pulls back, she is staring at him.  As if at a loss for something to say. \nGIN It's lucky we stopped by my room, for the wine. \nShe swallows.  Because his gaze is unrelenting. As if not forgetting that she's changed the subject. \nGIN Otherwise, we'd never have found my bag was stolen.  Until tomorrow. \nMAC Would that make it more stolen? \nShe smiles.  His face looks kind now, not formidable at all.  Maybe she's wondering if she actually likes him. \nGIN They even got my prescriptions. \nMAC Something you need? There are all-night chemists... \nHe does look concerned.  And therefore sweet.  She kisses his nose. \nGIN I take Prilosec.  For stomach acid.  And an inhaler.  For asthma. \nShe gets her old smile.  The soft, wicked tease. \nGIN But since I didn't have to work all that hard tonight... \nHe stares at her.  Cocks a finger, like a gun, right between her eyes.  Pantomimes pulling the trigger. \nGIN (softly) Ouch.  I had that coming. \nShe pivots, and snuggles her back comfortably into his chest.  He wraps strong arms around her.  Pulling her close. \nGIN Why would someone steal my luggage? Every guest in this place must have more than a wannabe art dealer. \nMAC Ah.  Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable in there. \nSomething in the tone. \nGIN Such as... \nMAC Well.  Wannabe dealers make excellent fences. \nA flicker.  In her eyes.  And she cuddles back.  As if enjoying the humor. \nGIN He thought I had a stolen painting.  In my bag. \nMAC I'm joking, of course. \nKisses the top of her head. \nMAC The Vermeer wouldn't fit. \nHer eyes widen.  Just a little. \nGIN Excuse me? \nMAC Why, did you do something wrong? \nShe turns all the way around.  Their faces are inches apart.  Each reading the other's eyes. \nGIN You said.  Vermeer. \nMAC The most famous painting stolen this week. \nHis turn.  To kiss her nose. \nMAC If you don't keep up on your craft.  You'll miss all the jokes. \nAnd lowers her gently onto her back.  Still staring in her eyes, he winds her legs around him.  Her mouth parts, but... \n...he fills it with his own. \nThis conversation.  Is over. \nINT. MAC'S SUITE - MORNING \nVIEW of the empty terrace, the rumpled, twisted coverlet.  Maybe they spent all night.  HEAR the shower running full blast in a distant bathroom.  PULL BACK to see... \nGin, hair wet, wrapped in a plush hotel robe, rapidly and expertly going through dresser, night stand, closet, sofa cushions, every goddam thing in the room.  She comes to... \nShe hesitates. \nOKATI Four million, six hundred thirteen thousand, five hundred? \nWow.  He slaps his hand on the table.  Lay it down, toots. \nGIN You first. \nHe shrugs.  Lifts straight up, from beneath the counter... \n...a brown paper-wrapped rectangle.  Not much larger than two feet square.  She can't even believe she's here, doing this.  Gestures to him.  Open it up! \nHe obliges, COUGHING grossly all the while.  Unwrapped, the painting does look like a Monet.  From here.  She stares at it. \nGIN Now bring me the real one. \nHe doesn't blink. \nOKATI This as real as it gets, lady. \nAnd from within her pocket.  The cellular RINGS.  She takes it out.  Puts it to her ear. \nMAC (O.S.) You got it? \nGIN (into phone) Is this an audition, a joke, or a rip-off?  I'm staring at an obvious forgery, here. \nMAC (O.S.) Turn it over. \nThis gives her pause.  Then, cradling the phone against her shoulder, she does as she's told.  To see... \nMAC (O.S.) Is there an envelope?  Taped to the back?  In a Ziploc bag? \nSure is. \nGIN (into phone) Uh-huh. \nMAC (O.S.) Detach the bag.  Read what's in it.  Aloud. \nShe does.  Carefully unfolding several sheets of paper, maps... \nGIN (reading into phone) Shikoku Naru, a freighter, it says, Yokohama to Jakarta...dates, statistics...specs on some kind of machine, diag... \nMAC (O.S.) Papers back in the envelope, envelope back in the Ziploc, very quickly, without seeming to hurry... \nHer eyes are flickering questions, but she does as she's told, cradling the phone with her shoulder. \nMAC (O.S.) Now take the debit card from your purse, slipping the Ziploc into the purse as you do it, shielding the move from everyone in the room but Okati. \nAnd she does.  More deftly than we could ever have imagined.  Like a pro. \nMAC (O.S., quietly) Give him the card. \nA beat. \nGIN (into phone) Mac, the painting's a forg... \nMAC (O.S., even quieter) This is a test.  Of whether you'll still be alive four minutes from now.  Do you hear me? \nHer face freezes.  In a pleasant smile. \nGIN (into phone) Yes, Mac, I do. \nMAC (0.5.) Now.  Hand him the card, and tell him in Japanese to pretend he is checking it by phone.  Tell him to take awhile, as if he's on hold. \nShe turns the sweet plastic smile to Okati.  Hands him the card... \nGIN (subtitled Japanese) Mac says, pretend you're checking this by phone, and take your ti... \nOKATI (subtitled Japanese) ...like I'm on hold, sure. \nAnd suddenly, his eyes are keen and quick, and he is no longer some schmuck in baggy pants.  He takes the card, stares at it comically, picks up the phone. \nMAC (O.S.) While he's checking, look around the room casually, as if searching for the cheesy handbags... \nShe begins to. \nMAC (O.S.) All the while laughing, as if you are chatting with someone you actually like. \nGIN (into phone) I'm not that good. \nBut she is.  And she laughs, as she strolls over to the cheesy handbags. \nMAC (O.S.) As you're looking around, do you notice any m... \nGIN (into phone) Three guys, two together, one alone.  Cheap suits, not looking at me in a cop-casual way. \nMAC (O.S.) Call out cheerily to Okati, in English, 'Where's the toilet?' \nGIN (into phone) Can I say, 'little girl's room'? \nA beat. \nMAC (O.S.) Wing it. \nGIN (calls out, cheerily) WHERE'S THE CRAPPER? \nOkati, absorbed by his make-believe phone call, points around the back. \nMAC (O.S.) Get going.  Now. \nGIN (into phone, as she saunters) Mac, the painting isn't... \nMAC You probably won't be dating any of them, so what the hell. \nGin looks around as they float through the maze of watercraft.  No one seems to be paying much attention.  What the hell.  She unzips the bag, pulling out... \nGIN (astonished) These...these are mine! \nHe never looks around. \nMAC Found 'em in your room.  Perhaps the thief wasn't your size. \nShe stares at the back of his head.  wondering.  He is stripping off his slickers.  A neatly-tailored SUIT beneath. \nMAC We have a business appointment. In four minutes. \nOkay.  She pulls her dress off OVER her head. \nGIN Business, huh? \nShe ignores some nearby WHISTLES and SHOUTS.  Begins drying herself with a fluffy towel from the bag. \nMAC (never turns) Time has come to tell you.  What business.  I'm actually in. \nUh-oh.  Paydirt. \nGIN Uh.  Am I gonna like th... \nMAC (quietly) I'm a thief. \nShe can scarcely believe he's admitting this. \nMAC And now that I've told you. I'll have to kill you. \nHe chuckles a Scottish chuckle.  Cold and warm, at once. \nMAC Or... \nShe slips the dry dress OVER her head. \nMAC ...you can spend the most interesting three weeks of your life.  Training. \nGIN Training for wha... \nMAC ...followed by the most exciting night of your life.  After which, you can walk away with 20 million untraceable dollars... \nShe blinks.  He means this. \nMAC ...which will come in handy. Things being what they are. \nHe shrugs. \nMAC From now on.  You can valet park. \nShe begins taking off her wet underwear, underneath the dress.  We suspect unseen hordes crestfallen at her modesty. \nGIN And if I refuse? \nMAC (very quietly) Don't.  Please. \nGIN I mean, you won't really kill me, I'm far too adorable. \nHe looks around at her.  As if deciding on that. \nMAC Last night, at Fujitsu, I did some business.  While you thought I was in the toilet. \nJesus. \nGIN What could you possibly steal in 18 min... \nMAC Thirty-five super-microchips. Each worth one million dollars. And change. \nStaring dead at her eyes. \nGIN You hate round num... \nMAC I stole your suitcase when I left you at the bar.  I have since sent it on to the States, with three chips, well hidden. \nAre you following? \nMAC Since you aren't there to claim it, the bag will sit at Customs. Safe.  Unless... \nNo smile.  No smile at all. \nMAC They receive.  An anonymous.  Tip. \nHoly.  Fucking.  Christ. \nGIN That's entrapment. \nMAC No, entrapment is what cops do to robbers. \nWe can feel her heart pounding from here. \nMAC Blackmail.  Is what robbers do to schmucks. \nAnd leans.  To kiss her mouth. \nMAC (softly) Even adorable ones. \nThey have glided up beside the gangway of a gigantic FREIGHTER.  It is at water level, the steps they use for their tender.  He points up to the name... \nMAC Pop quiz. \nThe man beams.  Gestures to a series of PLATFORMS, each SWAYING at different heights, in different directions. \nCARLSBY Our 'delicate treasure' platforms, suspended on gimbals.  Your cargo remains unruffled by roiling seas. Then, on arrival, is plucked... \nPointing once more... \nCARLSBY By that forklift, and gently deposited on dock through the cargo hatch... \n...a huge circular hatch cut into the hull.  Mac's eyes stare blankly at it.  A long beat.  He pronounces it all... \nMAC Adequate.  I suppose. \nAnd then turns once more. \nMAC Did we see...a bathing pool. On deck? \nCARLSBY Oh, yes, sir.  The Shikoku Maru carries sixteen luxury suite pas- senger cabins.  The finest cuisine. For valued clients who prefer to cruise in privacy. \nMac.  Thinks this over. \nMAC Mildly.  Interesting. \nINT. PASSENGER DECK - DAY \nCarlsby ushering the couple along a plushly-appointed hallway.  A secret oasis of refinement in the heart of the massive freighter. He opens a burnished door, into... \n...an elegant SUITE.  Cherrywood panels, spacious windows with views of the harbor.  The finest furnishings.  It is breathtaking. Even... \nMAC Adequate.  I suppose. \nGIN But dearest, in five months, we'll be in Cape Town. \nMac pulls from his pocket the folded sheets that had once been taped to the back of Okati's Monet.  Peruses them casually. \nMAC Anything sooner?  That goes perhaps from...say, Sri Lanka? To Jakarta. \nAnd looks up.  To a man dumbstruck.  By coincidence. \nCARLSBY Why, yes.  In three weeks. \nINT. CESSNA - DAY \nLooking DOWN on California's San Joaquin Valley from 12,000 feet, as air RUSHES past our open door. \nMAC (O.S.) You seem depressed. \nPULL BACK to see them both in jumping suits.  He's checking her gear.  She's eyeing the expansive grid of fields below. \nGIN At your insistence, I'm leaping to my death, and I don't know why! \nHe clips a tether from his harness to hers. \nMAC Because.  You're a greedy girl. \nGIN I'm not jumping until you talk about this, it's been two days! \nShe folds her arms across her chest.  Rebellious.  He smiles at her tenderly.  Nods, okay. \nGIN Why are we going in three weeks, if the wine is on a different route months lat... \nMAC There is no wine.  That just bought us a look at their security. \nShe stares at him. \nGIN I knew that. \nMAC What we want is on the boat in three weeks.  Now can we jump? \nGIN The machine in those diagrams.  on the back of the painting. \nMaybe.  He's still smiling. \nGIN What does it do, make gold? \nMAC We're nearing the targ... \nGIN Why won't you trust me? \nMAC How do I know who you are, hmmn? \nStares in her eyes. \nMAC For all I know, your name isn't Virginia Romay.  Maybe you're a cop. \nShe stares back.  Dead straight. \nGIN Why would a cop do all th... \nMAC (softly) Entrapment, remember? What cops do to robbers. \nGIN (just as softly) Oh.  That. \nHis smile is light, affectionate.  Gently, he backs her to the edge of the doorway... \nMAC One...two... \nShe THROWS her arms around his neck.  Holds him close. \nGIN Mac, I'm afraid. \nVulnerable and touchingly real.  His arms slide around her. \nDISAPPEAR in an ocean of STYROFOAM packing bubbles, which EXPLODE in all directions like popcorn in a nuclear accelerator. \nShe has totally VANISHED.  Buried alive. \nGIN (O.S.) DID I SAY SHIT? \nMac is wading into the sea of plastic bits, DIGGING her body out with his bare hands.  Once more, she comes up sputtering. \nGIN This one, I will not get! \nHe's holding her in his arms.  Leans close. \nMAC But you will, you'll get it all. You are actually... \nHe kisses her. \nMAC Quite remarkable. \nSomething in the way he looks at her.  Her return gaze is naked. It looks like love. \nMAC Take the rest of the evening off. \nAnd kisses her again.  Her eyes close. \nEXT. FRONT PORCH - MORNING \nMac sits alone at a table, sipping coffee, reading Barron's.   A short-wave radio is playing BBC World Service.  Leaning against an open laptop, is... \n...Mac's stopwatch.  He glances up at it.  What he sees makes him reach into a duffle at his feet, withdraw... \n...a rectangular gun-metal gray DEVICE.  Looks like a cross between a remote control clicker and a large cell phone.  Turns it ON.  The power display GLOWS green. \nEXT. HILLTOP - MORNING \nGin running alone.  Up the dirt path we've seen before.  Ahead, the crossroads, the sign.  The lonely phone booth. \nEXT. FRONT PORCH \nMac tuning the device, which is an advance-design SCANNER.  We HEAR overlapping CONVERSATIONS through bursts of STATIC... \nOVERLAPPING VOICES (O.S.) ...told you it's not a good time f...either, personally, I've never liked h...Giants' pitching, once ag...late, you want the Chronicle or don't y... \nINT. PHONE BOOTH \nGin at the phone.  Inserts her credit card.  Catches her breath. \nEXT. FRONT PORCH \nMac HEARS a phone RINGING over the scanner.  Punches RECORD, PLUGS the scanner INTO his laptop. \nVOICE (O.S.) Webber Assurance. \nGIN (O.S.) This is oh-four-six-one.  Hector Cruz, please, on a secure line. \nVOICE (O.S.) Please hold. \nMac's laptop screen in printing.  WEBBER ASSURANCE...HECTOR CRUZ... \nVOICE (O.S.) Go ahead, please. \nGIN (O.S.) Thank y... \nThe line goes DEAD. \nSo do Mac's eyes.  Click the scanner OFF. \nINT. PHONE BOOTH \nGin in her throaty, playful voice... \nGIN ...no way I'm telling you shit. \nCRUZ (O.S.) Baker, this is an extremely dangerous g... \nGIN ...right now, you're more dangerous than he is. \nA pause.  Her voice is smiling.  Not her eyes. \nCRUZ (O.S.) You want to explain th... \nGIN If I tell you what this is, and where this is, you'll send back-up, and those morons will blow my cover, and I'll be too dead to accept your apology. \nA longer beat. \nCRUZ (O.S.) You're fucking him, aren't you? \nGIN Right to the wall. \nHer eyes are stone cold.  We've never seen her like this.  She looks like Mac. \nCRUZ (O.S.) You're over your head, Baker. \nGIN Only romantically.  I'll write to him in prison. \nShe's pulling out a different piece of plastic.  A drug store phone card. \nCRUZ (O.S.) Okay, it's your funeral.  Next time I see you, I owe you a spanking. \nGIN Ooooo.  Is that a promise? \nHer cold eyes through his chuckle. \n...a series of metal RUNGS, which begin twelve feet above the water line, climbing the dizzying height to the freighter's deck, far above.  Mac has a Kevlar rope with a GRAPPLING HOOK, and as he reaches the rungs, he... \n...THROWS it high, one of the pronged hooks CATCHING on a rung twenty feet above them... \nMAC HOLD TIGHT! \nGIN IF YOU FUCKING INSIST! \nAnd he LETS GO of the propeller, PULLING both of them, laden with gear, OUT of the water with sheer brute strength.  PLANTING his feet against the outward curve of the hull, he CLIMBS with all his strength, hand over hand, until he finally... \n...GRASPS the bottom rung.  He PULLS them up, until she can GRAB ON.  They hold tight to their rung for a beat.  He attaches them both with metal carabiner clips. \nMAC If I were you, I'd watch the desserts. \nGIN Boy, I'll bet you were in shape before you got old. \nMAC Too long ago to remember. \nAnd pulls himself up to the second rung, so that he is standing an the first.  Offers her his hand... \nGIN I can take it from here, thanks. \nSuit yourself.  They begin to climb up the rungs, like a tilted backwards ladder, re-attaching their clips as they go. \nGIN If you'd packed my primary chute right, I wouldn't ha... \nMAC Yes, you would.  You're a girl. \nUp, up.  And stop.  They are nearly halfway to the top.  Looking across the curved hull to... \n...a large circular HATCH.  Thirty feet away.  The goal.  Mac pulls from his pack... \n...their SUCTION CUP gear.  With practiced speed, they fasten cups to the balls of their feet, take hold of the hand rods with cups attached, and Mac takes the lead as they begin to... \n...move LATERALLY across the hull's surface toward the hatch.  Mac is amazingly agile at the arduous process, scuttling sideways like a crab across the precariously tilted-back hull.  Gin is deter- mined, but falls well behind, intent on making every suction seal solid one.  Dark water RACES by beneath her.,  By the time she looks up at the hatch... \nHe is gone. \nMAC (O.S.) Anytime you're ready. \nShe looks UP sharply.  He is ABOVE the hatch, attached to the hull by the balls of his feet, hanging down like a bat.  Noting her astonishment... \nMAC Better angle. \nThat it is.  He has pulled a thick cylinder from his pack.  It's a battery-operated AIR WRENCH, and with a menacing WHIRR, only partially masked by the ship's wake, he begins to swiftly POP all the rivets around the hatch. \nGin has pulled out the slender WELDING TOOL we saw in the shower, and begins CUTTING through the metal seals around the hatch's rim. \nAt thecrucial moment... \nMAC You might want to move aside... \nWhich she BARELY does, as the hatch door PLUMMETS past her to the sea.  BIG splash.  Gone.  When she turns back, Mac is already THROUGH the opening and she follows, their yellow-green headlamps partially revealing... \n...the maximum-security HOLD.  We've seen this with Carlsby.  The fork lift.  The shadowy multitude of PLATFORMS on their gimbals, all SWAYING, in different directions with the plunging of the ship. Gin just stands, staring everywhere, like she's broken into Fort Knox.  The ROAR of the engines is louder here, and he moves close to her to speak beneath it... \nMAC May I trouble you for the torch? Or would you rather just dance. \nOh.  Slightly embarrassed at her lack of split-second efficiency, she tries to find the thing in her gear.  After watching her fumble for a bit... \nGIN I know I packed it. \n...he just reaches in and pulls it out.  A small LANTERN which he FLICKS on, brilliantly ILLUMINATING the entire hold.  Scans the platforms...polnts to a CRATE wrapped in 4-ply heavy duty plastic membrane. \nMAC Coal into diamonds.  A wealth machine. \nGIN How do you know that's it? \nMAC (as if stating the obvious) It's 12 by 9 by 7 feet.  And it's the only thing worth waterproofing, in case the ship sinks. \nGIN (softly) ...you twit. \nMAC Hmmn? \nGIN I'm just finishing your sentence. Can't you answer a question with- out making me feel stupid? \nHe's heading toward the swaying platforms... \nMAC Why would I bother? \nHe is climbing onto a lower platform, easily vaulting up to the magic crate.  She follows, but it isn't as easy as he's made it look.  She has to scramble, almost falling.  He's already pulled from his gear... \n...six rubber POUCHES.  She hands him her welding tool, and he begins attaching the pouches to the top and sides of the crate. \nThe plunging ship has the platform really rocking. \nGIN (concerned) They don't look like flotation bags... \nMAC (working fast) Shit.  Well then, let's forget the whole thing. \nShe stares at him. \nGIN Okay, it was a dumb ques... \nHis eyes come UP.  So fast that her breath stops.  He looks plenty angry. \nMAC Let's get one thing straight.  I don't work with partners much, because basically, I find most people to be idiots. \nShe swallows.  Hard. \nMAC You, in contrast, are first-rate. \n...her evening gown.  A wrinkle-free material which slips down across her legs from where it had been bunched across her hips. He is unzipping his outfit as well, revealing formal wear of his own.  He stuffs the suits into his gear pack, removing only... \n...her evening bag and shoes.  Then lifting both packs, he... \nGIN Um... \n...FLINGS them into the black ocean.  Gone. \nGIN ...I wouldn't do that. \nSo he turns.  She looks really stunned.  And scared. \nMAC Excuse me? \nGIN Well...I saw our suction things. Lying...over...there? \nShe points.  To where no suction things are lying. \nGIN (a mouse) ...so I put 'em in my pack? \nHis eyes WIDEN. \nGIN Or maybe.  I put 'em there. \nAnd points.  To where they are. \nShe tilts her head.  Gives him a great smile.  Is he enraged?  His dry grin says, not hardly. \nMAC I like a quick study. \nThen again.  You can never tell. \nEXT. FREIGHTER DECK - NIGHT \nExpansive barely-lit deck under a canopy of stars.  A silver-haired couple in immaculate evening attire stroll alone, he is humming to barely-audible dance music from a distant lounge.  She clings to his arm, it is romantic.  Until they reach the railing where he turns, and says something quietly in German... \nShe stiffens.  Pulls her arm away from his.  She sneers coldly, calls him a name in German, and he UNLOADS on her, a barrage of German-language INVECTIVE that would melt a tank.  She absorbs the abuse without flinching, turns toward the rail, HAWKS and... \n...SPITS over the side.  Strides away from him.  He watches her go. Then... \n...SPITS over the side himself.  And follows her. \nHalf a beat. \nMac's head APPEARS above the rail.  Just where they spit.  Not a mark on him. \nINT. BALLROOM - NIGHT \nOur old German couple are DANCING wonderfully in each other's arms Inspiring.  PAN a dozen really old couples dancing to the three- piece Filipino ensemble, until we come to... \nGin and Mac spinning slowly, flawlessly, their eyes telling the surrounding geezers that they are very much in love.  We CLOSE to hear their sweet murmurings... \nMAC ...no matter how many stones we make, the diamonds are just an appetizer. \nGIN (dreamily) And the meal...? \nMAC My contract.  With DeBeers. \nShe blinks.  Hit by a ton of bricks. \nGIN Oh my G... \nMAC Sensible folks, DeBeers.  A world monopoly in diamonds based on one simple principle...something's only priceless if it's scarce. \nHe WHIRLS her in a tight spin.  The geriatic Germans can only watch and envy. \nMAC These guys dig up all the diamonds on the planet, just to keep them out of circulation.  Otherwise, you could buy 'em at the Five and Dime... \nGIN Watch the old guy stuff, they don't have dimestores anym... \nMAC Imagine the chaos we could cause. \nShe is imagining. \nGIN You said 'contract'... \nMAC We're sort of bounty hunters. \nGin likes the ring of that.  Green eyes dance with delight. \nMAC Our machine is worth far more dead.  Than alive. \nVOICE (O.S.) Glad to see you're both alive. \nThey look over.  The officious STEWARD from this afternoon.  Now in black tie. \nSTEWARD When you missed cocktails.  And supper.  I thought of knocking on your door... \nMac turns Gin so that she can send the boob a lazy smile... \nGIN Oh, I wish you had.  We love having strangers join us!  Maybe later...? \nMac turns her once more, so that he faces the flummoxed steward across her bare shoulder... \nMAC Promise you an interesting time... \nTrademark smile. \nMAC Or my name's not Banquo MacDuff. \nYou twit. \nMAC One moment in time, you s... \nGIN Midnight, July 1, 1997.  Eight days from now.  The moment that Hong Kong is annexed by china. \nAnd now.  She has his interest.  She can see that. \nGIN 80-20 split. \nMAC Don't be so hard on yourself.  It's your plan, you should take at least thirty perc... \nGIN My 80, your 20.  Asshole. \nHe thinks this over. \nMAC 50-50.  Or you can swim to Taipei. \nShe is not impressed.  Or afraid.  He grins... \nMAC What are you gonna do with six billion dollars that you can't do with four? \nGIN Hold the record.  Alone. \nThis.  He likes.  So much that he leans to kiss her, with surprising tenderness. \nMAC Your share is 50%.  And one dollar. \nHer hard stare.  And then, she smiles.  Just barely.  Still in his arms... \nGIN I like what you left.  In the hold. \nMAC You didn't even see wha... \nGIN A lump of coal.  A pair of pliers. A note that said, 'Squeeze hard'. \nThis is the most taken with her that he has ever looked.  She leans up and kisses him.  Whispers... \nGIN Squeeze hard. \nEXT. STREET, SHIHLIN DISTRICT, TAIPEI - LATE NIGHT \nUgly section of an ugly town.  Unmarked warehouses, alleyways teeming with food stalls.  HEAR a motorcycle approach, and see... \n...Gin driving, Mac sits behind her.  Going real fast, maybe she's showing off, we FOLLOW them DOWN a blind alley, as she smoothly WHEELS them into... \n...an open FREIGHT ELEVATOR.  She climbs off, he doesn't.  As Gin goes to work the controls, Mac sees a cat curled in the corner, mewing softly. \nGIN That's Madame Chiang Kaishek, she's my bud.  An evil streak a mile wide. \nThe elevator JOLTS to life. \nMAC No surprise. \nThey CLANG upward.  Mac seems utterly relaxed.  Gin paces a little, hugging herself.  Her features tense. \nMAC (gently) Tired? \nShe blinks up.  He is straddling the bike.  Smiling at her. \nGIN I have a lot on my mind. \nAh.  Well... \nMAC You look beautiful doing it. \nHe seems to mean that.  And it seems to melt her a little.  She sags against the wall, closing her eyes, as... \n...they JOLT to a stop.  She PULLS the heavy LEVER, and the door SLIDES noisily open, to reveal... \n...a gigantic LOFT.  She flicks on a dim light, but we see only part of the cavernous space.  She strolls, Madame Chiang trotting along behind.  Mac follows, looking around, then down to see... \n...a pile of MAIL, cables, packages.  The unopened MAILING TUBE we saw in the Hancock Tower penthouse.  He crouches, lifts the tube in his hands... \nGIN (O.S.) You wanna buy a Vermeer? \nMAC Rather steal it. \nGIN (O.S.) Been there, done that. \nHe nods to himself.  Guess so.  He rises to see her framed against the gaping starlit opening of a huge LOADING DOOR.  The twinkling island lies below.  But here, Gin stares down at... \n...an elaborate architectural MODEL.  Fifteen feet across, it features an imposing yellow, pagoda-roofed BUILDING, built into the side of a model MOUNTAIN.  Formal gardens, fountains, tiny Kuomintang flags.  Stretching away from the building, a large portion of the CITY, with shops and alleyways elaborately detailed. As Mac joins her... \nGIN National Palace Museum, Taipei, Taiwan.  Repository of four thousand years of Chinese culture... \nHe bends to lift UP the detachable roof.  All the rooms are detailed within, down to exhibit cases. \nGIN Works of gold, bronze, jade, onyx, pots and scrolls, paintings and porcelains and lacquer work.  Every treasure the Kuomintang could loot before the Reds took over. (beat) Ever rob the place? \nMAC No.  If memory serves. \nShe takes him by the hand, and leads him toward the gaping doorway, walking straight toward it... \nGIN You need to eat something, or are you ready for sex? \nAnd just at the edge of it... \nMAC (torn) The options seem so limited. \nThey jump THROUGH the opening.  And VANISH. \nOur ANGLE closes on the doorway, to see OUT now, sitting like a jewel against the hillside... \nGIN Well, it's an eight billion dollar jump.  You miss the train...you've missed the train. \nFlicks ON her remote.  Down the track the engine REVS.  Like crazy. \nGIN We've got five days to grab the Bones, trade them for the Scan, and pull our 8 billion out of Hong Kong. Once midnight passes on July 1st... \nMAC ...we've missed the train, yeh. The Bones?  The Scan? \nGIN Oh.  Have I neglected to fill in the details? \nMAC An oversight. \nGIN Which I learned from the master. Hey.  Wish me luck... \nCLICKS the remote, the train LEAP5 forward, 36 MPH never seemed so fast!  She has a split-second to LEAP down, the train SAILS beneath her, Gin's feet GRAZE the back end of the platform at the rear of the car, she SWIPES DESPERATELY with the magnets, can't connect, and is THROWN into a ROLL along the side of the tracks. \nShe's UP on her knees, watching the train SLAM into the massive blue PADS at the end of the track.  She is bruised, shaken, but most of all, really worried and really pissed. \nMAC (quietly) Jump sooner. \nShe pulls out the remote... \nGIN Be my fucking guest. \nThe train ROCKETS backward, straight PAST where she kneels, to BRAKE at the start of the track once more.  She nods up to Mac, who is strapping on his magnets.  He crouches, nods, ready.  And the train... \n...BLASTS toward him, he counts, JUMPS, and SLAMS ONTO the ROOF of the train, which PLOWS into the heavy padding, FLINGING him twenty feet like a rag doll to land in a HEAP. \nHe lies still.  Then blinks, surprised he's alive.  HEARS a rich whiskey LAUGHTER down the track. \nMAC I'm too old for this shit! \nAnd as he pulls himself up.  She is staring at him, from her knees... \nGIN Know a dude named Wiley Coyote? \n...with what can only be described as love. \nGIN (softly) Forget it. \nEXT. NATIONAL PALACE MUSEUM, TAIPEI - DAY \nAERIAL VIEW down toward the sweeping pagoda roofs of the MUSEUM, the formal gardens, the fountains, the tree-lined driveway.  CLOSE now, as a cab pulls up, a couple emerges... \nShe is first.  Chanel suit with an extremely short skirt, revealing endless legs.  She helps him from the taxi, a white-haired geezer who seems well past 90, fumbling with his walking stick, and making quick, erratic, bird-like glances in every direction. \nShe takes his arm for support.  Murmurs in his ear... \nGIN Isn't it easier now?  Not pretending? \nGives him a full-tongue KISS in the ear, which has bystanders noticing.  Starts to help him up the stairs, still whispering close... \nGIN Five years, you won't need make-up. \nIn answer he GRABS her ass, and she YELPS with delight, attract- ing attention all around.  His turn to whisper, as he massages her backside... \nMAC We agreed.  No underwear. \nGIN Overkill.  I can do it with legs. \nHe stops.  Gives the long legs a dubious twice-over. \nMAC I'd lose the underwear. \nINT. MUSEUM - DAY \nMac leaning on her arm, as they pass case after case.  Bronzes, jades, lacquer work.  Every object exquisite, priceless. \nGIN The Oracle Bones date back to the Shang Dynasty, 3500 years ago. They are writings...carved into ox bones, tortoise shells... \nShe cuddles close to him.  They approach a tour group, the female guide speaking in four European languages.  Really loud. \nGIN The oldest Chinese writing any- where, the first proof of Chinese civilization. \nMAC What makes this one so valuable? \nHe stops, drowned out by the tour guide, rhapsodizing over an urn. Butts into her rap... \nMAC (subtitled Italian) Except it's Chien-lung, mimicking Sung Period.  The color is far too delicate. \nThe woman gets real insulted.  Apparently, he's right. \nMAC (subtitled German) It's all right, you have a nice body. \nAnd walks on.  Confides to Gin... \nMAC When you're old, you can do anything \nGRABS her bottom once more, altering her voice slightly on... \nGIN There we are. \nA separate display room.  A single steel pedestal.  Under the smart-glass security case, one single object.  It is a fragile, yellowed fragment of bone.  The shoulder blade of an ox.  Covered with tiny script. \nGIN Last year, ancient artifacts were discovered in the Gulf of Mexico. An Olmec civilization, 3200 years old. \nNo tourists in the display room.  A velvet rope is up.  Three GUARDS mill at the entrance.  This exhibit is off-limits. \nGIN Amazingly, markings on these Olmec figures were identified as Shang Dynasty writing... \nA sign explains, SORROWFUL TO INFORM ORACAL BONE CLOSE FOR TRAVEL EXIBITION UNTIL IS NOVEMBER. \nMAC Try to adjust to that for three more days.  After July 1... \nStares in her eyes. \nMAC ...you'll never have to trust again. \nAnd smiles.  One more whisper... \nMAC Something.  To look forward to. \nINT. TUNNEL LOADING DOCK \nThe museum guards are back on the landing with the official.  Our two soldiers stand facing them from the rear platform of the train car, as... \nThe train RUMBLES to life.  Ready to go. \nINT. MUSEUM \nTwo guards arrive with a hand truck to carry off the empty pedestal, which once supported the Bone's case.  One tilts the top of the pedestal back, supporting its weight, as the other stoops to lift the base, and... \n...stops.  He sees the coin.  Oddly flat against the pedestal's shaft.  He kneels, tries to lift the coin, but the magnet HOLDS it fast.  He looks up to his companion.  Then... \n...PEELS the coin free, the other guard reaches for it, the first guard YANKS it away, and it FLIES from his hand, INTO the wall, and drops.  As the guards go to look, the coin's back has come away. Revealing... \n...electronics. \nINT. TUNNEL LOADING DOCK \nAn ALARM SHRIEKS at a deafening level.  Five museum GUARDS BURST through the doorway, LEAP from the landing, pile into the Jeep, and BLAST OFF down the gravel roadway after the departed train. \nINT. BARRACKS ENTRANCE \nA much larger landing at the other end of the tunnel, facing back the opposite way.  The ALARM SCREAMS here, too, and massive steel doors CLANG open, as 25 SOLDIERS with assault rifles SWARM out onto the landing, taking up sharpshooter positions, weapons pointing back up the track. \nINT. AIR VENT #1 \nMac and Gin crouched in the vent, high above the track, gas masks dangle around their necks, magnet paddles from their wrists, various objects from their belt loops.  The alarm ECHOES, absolutely EAR-SPLITTING.  She leans to shout in his ear... \nGIN WE HAVE TO ABORT! \nAbove the siren, we can now hear the TRAIN coming... \nMAC HOW DO YOU EXPECT TO MAKE A CAREER OF THIS, IF YOU CAN'T TAKE A LITTLE INCONVENIENCE? \nThe train LOUDER, closer, the alarm BLARING... \nGIN THEY'VE GOT AN ARMY DOWN TH... \nMAC I can do this. \nQuietly.  Straight in her eyes.  The train ROARS into view, FLASHES beneath them, as he GRABS her wrist and... \n...JUMPS, HURTLING DOWN, both STRIKING the empty rear platform, Gin slipping off, but he HOLDS her fast, SWIPING with his magnet which... \n...CLANKS hard, LOCKS solid.  He PULLS her onto the platform, she looks dazed, clinging to him, he tugs her gas mask into place, slips on his own, and... \n...FITS a magnetic DEVICE from his belt loop ONTO the door lock, SPINS a dial on the device, which POPS the lack OPEN, Mac BURSTING... \n...THROUGH the door, lobbing a GAS GRENADE at the startled guards, who try to whirl and FIRE through the fog of red smoke, two wild SHOTS above the rolling Mac, and they are felled by the gas where they stand.  Gin races in, falling on her butt, as the car ROCKS along the track.  Points OUT the window... \nGIN (through mask) THERE'S THE NUMBER TWO VENT, ONLY 45 SECONDS TO THE THIRD! \nScrambling to her feet, Mac wheeling toward the Bone. \nGIN (through mask) TEST THE CASE! \nHe THROWS a handful of coins at the glass case, and purple UV BEAMS ARC from the glass to FRY the coins in midair.  Mac pulls a dull rectangle the size of a cigar box from Gin's backpack, as we SMASH CUT to... \nINT. TUNNEL \nThe Jeep BLASTING after the train at crazy speed, the four non- drivers with weapons at the ready... \nINT. BARRACKS LANDING \nTROOPS FILL the platform, and have spilled onto the tracks, enough weapons to dust Butch and Sundance. \nINT. TRAIN \nMac operating the cigar box which is actually a customized OSCILLOSCOPE, with countless KNOBS and a SCREEN which displays WAVE PATTERNS.  The machine is emitting SHRILL whistling TONES that cut through even the siren. \nGIN (through mask) TAKE IT TO 30 AND CLIMB! \nMac SPINS the dials and two overhead light bulbs BLOW.  The glass case housing a fire ax SHATTERS.  The Bone's case is untouched. \nSMASH CUT to... \nINT. TUNNEL \nWITH the Jeep, BOMBING around a curve to SEE the train at last.  WE OPEN FIRE, accelerating after the train with everything we've got, gravel FLYING like shrapnel, and up ahead... \n...the train's windows BLOW OUT, the tunnel SHOWERED with glass fragments.  SMASH CUT... \nINT. TRAIN \nMac JUICING the box, the deafening TONE competing with the sirens, the gunshots, Gin SHRIEKING as she points through a blasted-out window... \nGIN (through mask) THIRD VENT GONE! \nAnd the Bone's case EXPLODES, Gin WHIRLING away to protect her face, as we SMASH CUT to... \nINT. TUNNEL \nINT. VENT - DAY \nMac, very much alive, somewhat the worse for wear, crawling through a darkened pipe on his belly, toward... \n...a grating.  Light filters through.  Reaching the screen, he squints through it.  Can't see shit.  Listens.  Nothing that rises above an ambient wooshing of air in the duct.  He grasps the wires, pushes, and... \n...FALLS straight THROUGH, tumbling ten feet to CRASH LAND in a heap.  HEAR feminine SCREAMS before we look up to... \n...three young WOMEN trying on lingerie, being attended by an older SALESWOMAN.  The girls are half-naked and as Mac rises, one THROWS a red lace TEDDY in his face.  He peels it off, and still holding the garment, calmly tells the saleswoman... \nMAC (subtitled Mandarin) It's all right, the security cameras behind the mirrors are working again. \nAt which the customers SHRIEK, cover themselves all the more, and begin screaming at the poor saleswoman.  During which... \nMAC (subtitled Mandarin) Well.  If everything is in order... \nAll four women.  Look at him. \nEXT. LINGERIE SHOP, SHIN KONG MALL - SUNSET \nCLOSE on an entrance, just as Mac comes... \n...FLYING THROUGH, propelled by two sizeable SECURITY GUARDS, once again landing in pieces.  It's a long day.  As Mac clears his head, they stand at the doorway with folded arms.  Hoping he wants some more. \nMAC WHAT KIND OF A COUNTRY IS THIS?  IN BRITAIN, A MAN CAN TRY ON LINGERIE WITHOUT COMPROMISING HIS DIGNITY! \nThe bruisers look at each other.  No habla Espanol. \nEXT. KAOHSHING HARBOR, TAIWAN - DUSK \nA super TUGBOAT, engines RUMBLING, ready to pull out.  A woman paces the deck.  Every time we see her, she seems more tightly wrapped.  At last... \n...here he comes, stepping briskly from the taxi, striding up the gangway, pulling from inside his coat... \n...the red lace teddy.  He drapes it over her face, and she pulls it away, steps into his arms... \n...her kiss is urgent.  Real.  HOLD on the look in her eyes.  What is she thinking? \nHe strokes her hair, gently.  Then, goes to look into the Halliburton case, which stands by the rail.  As he crouches.  As he looks at the Bone... \nShe is watching him.  An intensity to her gaze.  More feeling than she is comfortable with, which... \n...disappears completely, as he turns to her.  And when he mimes FLINGING the case into the sea... \nShe laughs. \nEXT. STATUE SQUARE, HONG KONG - DAY \nCLOSE on a British Petroleum BILLBOARD with a huge DIGITAL CLOCK, counting down by seconds...JUNE 29, 1997, 11:32 A.M. - 1 DAY, 12 HOURS, 27 MINUTES, 48 SECONDS TO:  REUNION WITH CHINA! \nPAN to an AERIAL VIEW of... \nHong Kong's bustling STATUE SQUARE, the hub of countless feeder streets and alleyways, as we ROAM to a SERIES OF SHOTS... \n...billboards everywhere.  Western businesses that announce WE'LL STILL BE HERE FOR YOU.  Others, primarily British, sending farewells, gratitude for past patronage.  China-sponsored depictions of happy Hong Kong and Chinese citizens, proclaim ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS. \n...moving vans, people pushing carts of belongings, shop signs advertising blowout inventory clearance sales.  Traffic beyond gridlock.  The human ant colony. \n...incredibly long queues in front of post offices, American Express, the imposing glass and steel skyscraper called the HONG KONG AND SHANGHAI BANK BUILDING. \n...large groups of uniformed CHINESE SOLDIERS in the streets.  More orderly DEMONSTRATION by anti-China PROTESTERS, their signs say MORE DEMOCRACY and FREE HONG KONG, their numbers watched by Chinese soldiers, who in turn are watched by British soldiers. \nCLOSE on the square now.  A couple at a sidewalk vendor.  Mac is purchasing a t-shirt.  Gin dutifully lifts her arms, and Mac slips the garment over her head.  It says CHINA GOT HONG KONG, AND ALL I GOT WAS THIS LOUSY T-SHIRT. \nHe regards her thoughtfully, and she turns, modeling for him as if wearing a Givenchy original.  He approves, lifts the Halliburton case, and they move on, strolling, chatting until Mac... \n...bumps HARD into a Chinese SOLDIER, both men REELING with the impact.  The soldier carries an identical HALLIBURTON CASE, and the two men set their cases down side by side, as Mac steps forward... \nMAC (subtitled Mandarin) FUCKING HELL!  WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GOING, MAN! \nNo one notices, no one cares.  Gin tugs on Mac's arm, don't get involved, dear.  Mac reluctantly steps back.  The soldier glares at him.  Then, bends and picks up... \n...Mac's case.  A parting epithet in Mandarin, and the soldier starts off.  Watching him, Mac unobtrusively fingers a concealed... \n...PISTOL, ready for action.  But keeps watching, as within a few yards, the soldier... \n...stops.  Opens the case.  Checks out the Oracle Bone, right there in the middle of the square.  Mac and Gin watching across the distance, with hair-trigger keenness.  At last the soldier CLOSES the case... \n...walks back to us. \nSOLDIER (subtitled Mandarin) I believe I took your case. \nHanding it to Mac, he leans forward, and in low, aecented English... \nSOLDIER 21 Old Peak Road.  In 45 minutes. \nPicks up his own case.  And is gone. \nEXT. MANSION, VICTORIA PEAK - DAY \nA vintage Aston Martin pulls up to a spectacular gated MANSION. Sparkling white, it is a blend of Edwardian and Regency.  Gin is driving, speaks into the voice box, and the gate swings open.  As they pull up the crushed rock driveway... \n...a BUTLER appears, as British as the architecture.  Climbing from the car, Mac has the Halliburton case. \nBUTLER Will you please come this way? \nAnd leads them around the side of the house.  They walk slowly, a distance behind the butler, taking everything in. \nMAC I like this. \nHis voice is strong, calm.  No hint of a smile. \n...goggles.  Like one would wear in a tanning salon.  Only these are flesh-colored with one small hole in the center of each lens. Slightly larger than the size of a pupil. \nShe slips them on.  A bright smile. \nGIN How do I look, honey? \nAnd Mac smiles.  In return. \nMAC Like a woman.  Of mystery. \nINT. SUITE, PENINSULA HOTEL - LATE NIGHT \nGlass doors open WIDE to a terrace which overlooks Kowloon, the harbor, Hong Kong Island beyond.  More lights than stars in heaven. And speaking of heaven... \n...the SOUNDS of lovemaking are fierce, feral, an urgent rhythm, part comic, part wondrous, and mostly, arousing enough to make us PAN TO... \n...lovemaking in silhouette.  This is the lovemaking of tigers, mesmerizing to watch, ferocious enough to inspire envy, and somehow... \n...tender enough.  To suggest real love. \nLATER...Mac and Gin sit before the open terrace.  There is wine and food and abandoned clothing all around them.  She has her pack drawn near.  And Qiu's leather pouch.  She removes the goggles... \nThis is the moment. \nGIN In the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank Building.  Is a room with two computers.  One for you. And one for me. \nMAC Glad I have a function, here. \nGIN The room is a vault on the 14th floor.  Access codes to that room are changed daily, computer pass- words on the hour, but... \nBut.  She is electric, more alive than he's ever seen her. \nGIN Four men in the world.  Don't need codes.  Their retinas will scan to unlock everything.  One of these is China's Minister of Finance. \nShe lifts the goggles... \nMAC And his retinal plate is in there. \nYep. \nMAC Our trade for the great train robbery.  All right, let's say we're in the door.  Now what? \nFrom her pack, she pulls a slender black rectangle.  Opens it to reveal a shiny metallic DISC. \nGIN Hong Kong has a huge portion of its holdings invested in foreign banks. In hundreds of separate accounts... \nHolds up the metallic disc. \nGIN This CD ROM is programmed to send, instantaneously, thousands of instruc- tions, with all necessary confirmation codes, to transfer reasonably modest sums out of those accounts.... \nMAC Modest. \nGIN Two or three million at a crack, in odd numbers.  Total, eight billion.  And change. \nMAC And you've set up a laundry. \nGIN Every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches, Austria, Uruguay, Antigua, The Channel Islands, the Caymans... \nMAC (quietly) Seychelles? \nGIN (beat) I left that out. \nMAC You're forgiven. \nGIN Thank you.  As soon as each deposit lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere else, til the Mafia couldn't find it. \nMAC But those first instructions, transferring the 8 billion dollars. They're recorded in the main computer. \nShe waggles the disc. \nGIN Nope.  The CD instructs the computer to erase the real transactions. And replace them in its memory with an innocuous loan coded XJ6. Little homage to Limeyland, there. \nMAC Dearest.  The accounts won't reconcile. \nShe waggles the disc.  Again. \nGIN Wrong.  The CD instructs the computer to over-report all account totals forever, in the exact amounts we've lifted.  So the Chinese think the money's still there. \nOn this one.  He has to smile. \nMAC The money.  Is still.  Missing. \nGIN Sure, the foreign banks know they sent out some money.  But they think Hong Kong knows it, too.  And since we're leaving plenty in every account... \nMAC The shit doesn't splatter.  Until the first account runs dry. \nExactly. \nGIN And then.  Comes the really brilliant part of the whole thing! \nMAC I was hoping there'd be one. \nHe settles back.  Looks at her. \nGIN Admit it, so far you're blown away. \nWell... \nMAC It does sound like the beginning of a beautiful friendship. \nAnd his fingers reach out... \nShe looks in his eyes.  Her body seems to relax, just a little. She takes his arm. \nINT. 14TH FLOOR \nCLOSE on a KEYPAD.  Next to it, a mirrored PLATE with two APERTURES, set apart the distance of human eyes.  Gin's goggled face DROPS into frame, reflected in the mirrored surface.  She fits her eyes to the apertures... \nGIN (whispers) Open.  Sesame. \nA red scanning light APPEARS.  Tracks vertically.  BEEPS.  Tracks horizontally.  And from somewhere... \n...a soft CLICK.  PULL BACK now, to see... \nThey stand at what seems the door to a BANK VAULT.  Round, gigantic, heavy steel.  Bolts eyerywhere.  Mac reaches to GRASP the handle, and... \nCLANG.  The door swings OPEN.  They stare at the inner sanctum... \n...a windowless ROOM.  Dim, eerie fluorescence.  A blast of white noise from the elaborate air-cooling system.  Two large MAINFRAME COMPUTERS face each other from opposite walls, desks and work stations with PC monitors filling the space between.  As Mac closes the vault door behind them... \n...Gin goes quickly to the smaller mainframe.  Pulls the high- resolution monitor around on its adjustable arm.  The screensaver displays Guernsey cows swimming among tropical fish.  She hits a key.  The screen saver replaced by, WELCOME.  AUTHORIZATION MODE PLEASE.  Two boxes for PASSWORD and SCAN.  She hits SCAN.  A plastic shield RISES, revealing... \n...the mirrored PLATE, the tiny APERTURES.  Gin leans to fit her goggled eyes in place.  The red scanning light.  Vertical track. BEEP.  Horizontal track.  And the monitor announces...WELCOME MINISTER FEIHONG.  Gin takes off the goggles, and... \n...THROWS them across the room to Mac at the larger mainframe.  As he repeats the scanning process, Gin is loading the precious CD-ROM into her mainframe's driver.  Watches the screen... \nGIN Uploading.  And you've got... two minutes, fifty seconds. \nWITH Mac now.  Typing the words CONTROL PANEL.  The screen now shows icons for time setting, and he clicks his mouse to create a CLOCK in the center of the screen, labeled LOCAL TIME, and reading 11:57:19, changing with each second that passes... \nMAC So let's see.  Across town at the British Consulate... \nINTERCUT...frenzied activity in a large war room filled with computers, wall screens, every worker functioning at top speed... CONTINUE to hear Mac over this... \nMAC (V.O.) ...everyone is working frantically to complete transactions before they go off-line at midnight. \nCUT BACK to Mac in the vault.  He clicks his mouse to create a clock at the LEFT of the screen, labeled BRITISH TERMINAL TIME. It is, of course, showing the same time as the local clock. \nMAC ...then, deep in the high-tech bowels of the Bank of China Building, just across the square... \nINTERCUT...an even larger war room, even better staffed and equipped.  Everyone...doing...nothing.  Staring at blank monitors and wall screens. \nMAC (V.O.) ...the Chinese are sitting on their thumbs, waiting to come on-line at midnight. \nCUT BACK to Mac in the vault.  He clicks his mouse to create another clock at the RIGHT of the screen, labeled CHINA TERMINAL TIME.  Shows the same time as the other clocks.  11:58:22. \nMAC I feel for these boys.  Let's give them a breather, hmmn? \nCLICKS the mouse, and the BRITISH TERMINAL TIME begins FLASHING. \nMAC We'll let the Brits go off-line 4 seconds early. \nAs the flashing clock reaches 11:58:30, and Mac HITS the key four times, advancing the British clock to 34 seconds, four seconds later than the others. \nMAC And we'll give our new Chinese overlords 4 extra seconds of rest before they have to go on-line. \nAs the local and Chinese clocks reach 40 seconds, Mac HITS the key four times, regressing the Chinese clock back to 36 seconds. \nWe watch all three clocks, clicking down the last moments of British rule.  The British clock is 4 seconds FAST, the Chinese clock 4 seconds SLOW. \nMAC Playing God here, Ginger.  We've created 8 seconds that do not exist, anywhere but in this room. \nLOCAL TIME...11:59:00.  One minute to midnight. \nMAC 8 seconds, where no one is on-line but your little CD-Rom. \nHe turns around.  Her eyes are waiting.  Across the room. \nMAC And when, eventually, everyone discovers what transaction XJ6 was really about... \nGIN China will think it happened before midnight.  Britain will swear it happened after midnight... \nMAC They'll each be positive.  The other guy.  Did it. \nMac sighs.  This is a sad thing. \nMAC Liable to be an ugly international incident. \nShe squints across at his clock. \nGIN Britain off-line in 18 seconds. We're bulletproof. \nHis smile returns.  Bittersweet and real... \nMAC Baby girl.  Nothing.  Is bulletproof.  Ever. \nThe look holds.  He turns back to his screen.  She lingers on him for an instant.  Then, back to the mainframe, finger poised above her ENTER key... \nMAC Britain goes bye-bye in 6... \nINTERCUT...The British Consulate.  All screens go DARK.  A logo APPEARS of a POPPING Champagne BOTTLE, whose spray forms a Union Jack twined with a PRC flag, everyone SHOUTS, cheers or curses, and we SMASH CUT... \nBACK to Gin...striking ENTER, the screen flashing TRANSACTIONS XJ6 PROCESSING. \nGIN (softly) Jesus God, it's going through. \nMAC (watching his clocks) Hong Kong midnight, happy new year. Except at China Bank. \nGIN (to her screen) C'mon, c'mon... \nHer screen flashes TRANSACTIONS XJ6 COMPLETED, hear her SHRIEK of ecstasy, as we... \nINTERCUT...Bank of China where dark screens suddenly LIGHT with the same stupid PARTY LOGO.  Only nobody cheers.  They just get to work. \nGIN Not the most flattering way to put it. \nHe takes his big tourist shopping bag.  Puts it in her hand. \nMAC I've changed your travel plans. \nThey are descending now.  Into the vast underground train station. \nGIN Mine. \nMAC Instead of taking the subway to the airport, you change at Jordan Station for Kowloon Tong.  Got that? \nGot that? \nMAC Jordan is only 90 seconds up the line.  Like a wire transfer, you're gone.  Vanished. \nHe holds up a silencing finger.  Listen to me. \nMAC In this bag are passports, tickets, papers.  An amber wig, a good one.  A dress you can slip on in five seconds. \nHer eyes moving over his face.  What is this? \nMAC You're on a tight connection to the Trans-Siberian Express, be in Europe in a week. \nGIN Mac, wh... \nMAC Shhh.  You always talk too much. \nThey're at the booth.  He pays their fare.  Through the turnstiles, now. \nMAC Time has come to return the favor. One last time. \nSmiles at her.  As they enter a tunnel. \nMAC Tell you.  What business.  I'm actually in. \nAnd in an instant of blind panicked clarity.  She gets the whole thing. \nGIN (hushed) My God.  You're a cop. \nMAC (very softly) That's my girl. \nKeep walking.  People are everywhere.  But they are alone in the world. \nMAC See, my profession was cover, too.  A notorious thief has access to colleagues, their plans... \nHe sighs. \nMAC I've turned in...well, couple hundred.  over forty years. Scotland Yard, Interpol, FBI... \nLooking around the tunnel. \nMAC Thought I might retire.  After you. \nGIN And all the...microchips, the diamond machine... \nMAC Well, the chips were returned. The machine was just a box, did you actually think it was real? \nGlances at her. \nGIN I thought...everything was real. Stupid girl. \nEnd of the tunnel in sight now.  It leads to a massive, endless quai.  Trains in transit. \nGIN Those were your jobs, so I could have claimed entrapment.  You had to wait.  For mine. \nNearly there.  He says nothing.  Looks pretty grim. \nGIN The Oracle Bone... \nMAC Well, the State Department liked that one.  They have more fish to fry with Beijing than Taiwan. \nHe sighs. \nMAC So they're taking credit for letting it go through.  Tho I'm afraid your Colonel may be in for a career disappointment. \nShe stops walking.  She has to know... \nGIN And the 5 billion. \nAh.  That. \nMAC I haven't told them. \nGently, takes her arm.  Leads her onto the endless train platform. Walking slower now. \nMAC I said you hadn't revealed the job.  That it wouldn't take place until after the changeover. \nDown the platform they stroll.  As her eyes wander... \nMAC Don't look, they're there. \nHer breath catches.  Her eyes go down. \nGIN And my tickets.  In the shopping bag? \nMAC Well.  Kept my options open.  If I give you up, they don't matter, do they? \nHer heart pounding through her chest. \nGIN If. \n", "test1_input": "A held beat.  His glance lifts beyond her shoulder. \nMAC Excuse me. \nAnd walks off toward a sleek custom TOURING CAR just pulling up. She goes after him. \nGIN I didn't know Porsche made things like this. \nMAC Well, they don't... \nTipping the valet.  Sliding in... \nMAC ...as a rule. \nShutting the door.  Through the open window, she hands something from her bag.  A plastic rectangle which OPENS into a slide viewer. She presses the light ON.  He looks at the slide. \nGIN Recognize that? \nNo reaction. \nGIN My seller is in Shinjuku, we can go there tonight. \nShe leans closer. \nGIN He wants 4.6 million.  I can get it for three. \nHe hands it back.  Looks in her eyes. \nMAC No, you can't. \nAnd TAKES OFF.  Her jaw drops slightly, but in one fluid motion... \nShe's hailed a cab. \nINT. IMPERIAL HOTEL BAR - LATER \nGraceful, timeless room, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in the '20s.  Burnished.  Elegant.  Way cool.  A place to drink, to deal, to dream.  PAN down the polished surface of the bartop, til we come to... \n...a tropical DRINK.  Cute little umbrella, tilted back toward the room.  ROTATE ANGLE to see... \n...INSIDE the umbrella, something small, something mechanical.  A woman's HAND ADJUSTS the point of the umbrella ever so slightly, and we PAN UP her arm to see... \n...Gin.  Still in her gown.  She is reading, with half-glasses, and one of the bows curls around her ear, which we CLOSE on to hear... \n...static.  Gin adjusts the drink umbrella, which is a directional mike, and hears... \nMAC (O.S.) ...only it's not bloody football! \nSNAP to Mac's table, well across the room.  Drinking giant beers with a large, really fat Japanese guy in a costly; if wrinkled, suit.  The hulk listens with stone attention to Mac's rant, as if he actually gave a shit. \nMAC (O.S.) ...it's just that crap Americans call 'football', like you could call your ass a butterscotch scone and have it be one! \nThe guy nods seriously.  Maybe he's a Sumo dude. \nMAC Why you'd want to bring that foolishness to Japan, you're just pissing your investment down a bungee hole. \nSUMO GUY (major accent) You got Cubano this trip? \nThat he does.  Mac pulls out a leather cigar holder, and passes it over.  Flat against one side is an ENVELOPE, which Sumo Guy PALMS skillfully, slipping it seamlessly INTO his pocket as he withdraws a small MATCH BOX.  Takes out one long cigar, lights up... \nMAC Seriously, put the money into pharmaceuticals or prostitution, something stable. \nThe big guy pushes the cigar holder and match box back toward Mac. Opening the box, Mac sees one match and a small MICROCHIP fastened to the cardboard.  Lights up.  Slides the match box in his pocket. \nMAC Garbage, perhaps.  Or industrial plastics. \nANGLE...Gin still engrossed in her reading.  A figure leans down next to her.  She startles, slightly.  So surprised to see... \nMAC My favorite thing in life. Coincidence. \nShe gives him the great smile. \nGIN I'm staying here, what's your excuse? \nAnd now he smiles.  First time ever.  A little chilling, the way he does it. \nMAC Staying here, as well.  You are in room...? \nGIN (half a beat) One thirty-eight. \nIn one motion, he flags the bartender... \nMAC Will you send a half-bottle of Chateau d'Yquem '67 to Room 138, please?  And some berries and chocolates for the lady to enjoy it with. \nHe presses some currency into the barkeep's hand.  Turning back... \nMAC Actually, I was just across the room, dickering with a gentleman over the purchase of an interesting Spitzweg.  Until I determined the painting was apparently stolen... \nOh.   She's shocked.  He agrees... \nMAC Goes against my grain.  The DeKooning in your slide, the 4.6 million you can get for 3.  Can you get it for 2 and a half? \nShe looks in his eyes. \nGIN Sure. \nAnd as if he believed her... \nMAC My checkbook is in my safe.  You wait here. \nHis smile evaporates.  He is gone before she can say... \n", "test1_true": "INT. CAR, SHINJUKU DISTRICT - NIGHT \nMac driving in silence.  Gin stealing glances at him.  Suddenly and smoothly, he reaches down, and picks up... \nGIN That's my purse. \nHe opens it.  One eye on the road, he begins to rummage... \nMAC Just want to see if I'm with the person you say you are.  Can't be too caref... \nShe SNATCHES the bag away from him, he GRABS it back, the car SWERVES LEFT, and... \n...CRASHES VIOLENTLY into a parked pure white Bentley.  Metal BUCKLES and TEARS, both ALARMS go OFF, a cacophony of horrific NOISE. \nMAC (quietly) Oh, dear. \nPeople come RUNNING, but our focus is drawn to the refined elderly COUPLE who were just returning to their precious Bentley.  Their WAILS and ANGUISH would be suitable if all their grandchildren had been crushed beneath Mac's wheels. \nMac and Gin are OUT of the car.  As he exits, Mac has palmed a small BLADE, and in a quick unseen motion, RIPPED a jagged tear in his left trouser leg.  The old couple RUSH to Mac, SHRIEKING their rage and grief in Japanese, Gin is trying to calm them as bystanders gather, but Mac cuts through... \nMAC (subtitled Japanese) We'll go in there, and call the police. \nAnd HOBBLES off toward the nearest building, a block-square 30-story skyscraper bearing the name FUJITSU.  The couple, the crowd, all race after the limping Mac... \nGIN Are you all right? \nNo answer, he looks dark enough to rain.  INTO the public lobby of the huge industrial complex.  Two night GUARDS come hurrying from their desk, as the small mob POURS in.  Mac in the lead, a commanding presence, tells the guards in a loud, clear voice... \nMAC (subtitled Japanese) I have damaged the car of these kind people.  Please help them call the police... \nOne guard leads the hysterical couple toward a phone.  Mac pulls up his trouser leg, and Gin GASPS to see a bloody GASH.  Mac drops the trouser back over the wound.  Asks the remaining guard... \nMAC (subtitled Japanese) May I use a washroom, please. \nThe guard nods absently, disoriented by the chaos.  Mac hands his billfold to Gin... \nMAC These are my papers, passport, car registration.  If the police arri... \nGIN You're going to need stitches, let me get you to a hospital. \nSoft words, genuine concern.  And his eyes flicker.  As if somehow seeing her for the first time.  A small spark, but she feels it. Softer still... \nGIN Really, this can all wait. I'll handle it. \nThe look holds. \nMAC That's actually.  Very sweet. \nHis first real smile.  It was worth waiting for. \nMAC (to a guard, subtitled Japanese) Might you have a First Aid kit, of some kind? \nINT. TOILET STALL \nWe are inside an empty, closed, Japanese-style toilet stall. Porcelain foot rests.  A hole.  The door BURSTS OPEN, and... \n...Mac enters FAST with the First Aid kit, locking the door, hitting the STOPWATCH on his wrist, which begins counting at ZERO.  He pulls UP his trouser leg, revealing the bloody gash, and simply... \n...RIPS the entire wound OFF, the rubbery prosthetic wound DANGLES, dripping its phony blood.  Mac pulls gauze strips from the kit, SOAKS them in bogus gore, expertly WRAPS his leg, then FLUSHES the prosthetic DOWN the hole. \nHe pulls off the FUJITSU VISITOR badge clipped to his lapel, and from a Ziploc bag slides a small sheet of plastic, which he PRESSES to the face of the badge, fitting perfectly, turning the badge into... \n...an EMPLOYEE I.D., the name KAWAKUBO, M., the PHOTO of a surly Japanese male.  Quickly, Mac takes out the MATCH BOX from the hotel bar, and with a fine tweezers gently removes the MICROCHIP, placing it INSIDE the badge, activating it with a soft BEEP-BEEP.  He reaches now... \n...behind his back, up UNDER his tux jacket, and RIPS FREE a tightly-compressed PACK of what seems white paper or cloth.  He SNAPS it loose, revealing it to be... \n...a baggy CLEAN SUIT, not unlike hospital scrubs and falling to the floor... \n...a white HOOD.  With opaque tinted VISOR. \nINT. SECURITY CORRIDOR \nMac in his clean suit and opaque-visored hood at an elevator marked CLEARED PERSONNEL ONLY in English and Kanji (Japanese characters). He holds his badge to the SCANNER, the door PINGS and slides OPEN.. \nINT. PREP ROOM ENTRANCE, 29TH FLOOR \nMac emerging from his elevator at the entrance to an AIR-LOCK with sign CLEAN ROOM - CLASS 10.  Holds his badge to the SCANNER, the air-lock door lights FLASH froin red to yellow to green.  He enters... \n...the PREP ROOM.  Recorded VOICES purr safety instructions in Japanese, while Mac stands, being bombarded by air shower, chemical sprayer, blinding UV light.  The next air-lock OPENS.  He enters... \nINT. CLEAN ROOM \n...a long ASSEMBLY LINE, where ROBOT ARMS work on a stream of black SILICON WAFERS, which pass along a clear Lexan CONVEYOR BELT.  The wafers move through various airtight CHAMBERS, exposing them to multi-colored gasses, cyan, sodium yellow, magenta, etc., as part of the microchip manufacturing process. \nMore than a dozen TECHNICIANS in their hooded clean suits watch over every phase of the work, attached to the walls by grounding wires and air hoses, which create a deafening NOISE.  Mac simply hooks himself up, and saunters straight THROUGH the area, toward the place where the conveyor belt with its newly-processed MICROCHIPS... \n...DISAPPEARS through the wall.  Nearby, a HATCH is built into the same wall, and Mac calmly CLANKS it OPEN, squeezing through into... \n...a dimly-lit MAINTENANCE BAY.  Panels of switches, wires, fuses, fans, air cleaners.  Maximum claustrophobia, as Mac CLANGS the hatch SHUT behind him, looking instantly to... \n...an OVERHEAD HATCH with letters in Kanji and English, DANGER ARGON GAS.  Mac THROWS back his hood, YANKS out his mini oxygen pouch, fits the slender forked breathing tube into his nostrils, and slips on thick round infrared GOGGLES that make him look like a refugee from 12 MONKEYS.  No time to lose... \n...up THROUGH the overhead hatch, closing it behind him as he enters... \n...the conveyer TUBE, a horizontal Lexan cylinder three feet in diameter, filled with billowing red gas.  Mac stretches out on his belly, glancing up to where the clear conveyor belt, with its precious cargo of microchips, runs along just above his head in eerie red light.  He begins to... \n...shimmy, crawl, squirm along the length of the tube.  Gas too thick to see the end.  He is agile as a commando, hauling ass, when suddenly... \n...the floor beneath his tube FALLS AWAY, and he is crawling in space 29 stories above Tokyo, as his tube spans the distance between manufacturing and shipping structures.  He goes faster, HARDER... \nINT. MICROCHIP VAULT \n", "test2_input": "GIN And how does this fit into the game pl... \nMAC Oh, it doesn't.  We came for the view. \nAnd from his contoured backpack, he pulls a bottle of Cristal. Flutes, wrapped in velvet.  He POPS the cork in one motion, and it SAILS to its watery doom.  She can't help but watch. \nOne more motion to pour both glasses.  Hands one to her.  Toasts... \nMAC To Ginger Baker. \nHe clicks her glass.  She stares straight in his eye.  Shows no surprise, no fear... \nGIN I'm partial to drummers.  If they played with Clapton and Winwood. \nAnd takes a sip.  Cool as a goose.  Licks her lips. \nGIN The prescription bottle.  When you stole my suitcase. \nBut he's not drinking.  Only staring.  The wind has picked up. \nGIN Armand Baker was my husband, May 13 to October 27, 1982, he played alto sax, I was 17 years old. \nShe takes another sip.  Good wine. \nGIN He named me Ginger.  He likes drummers, too. \nMAC And you get sentimental for him. Every time you order drugs. \nGIN I have I.D. in that name.  I use it for various things I don't want traced.  When credit unions turn their computers my way. \nMAC I could listen to you lie all night. \nShe toasts him. \nGIN (softly) Same here, fella. \nSlowly, he reaches to an inside pocket, watching to see if she flinches.  Her eyes do flicker.  And follow.  He withdraws not a pistol, but a handful of... \nMAC Do you like diamonds? \nNine DIAMONDS, so large, so exquisite, she has to keep her eyes from bugging.  Wow. \nMAC You asked.  Does the machine. Make gold. \nHoly.  Christ. \nMAC Gold is shit.  It's six thousand dollars a pound.  Worth your weight in gold...? \nHis eyes travel her body... \nMAC That would put you at seven hundred thousand. \nGIN Would you pay it? \nAnd he leans.  Looks in her eyes. \nMAC When the light hits you just right.  I'd pay more. \nShe liked that.  Maybe a lot. \nGIN The machine.  That we are stealing. Makes diamonds? \nNo answer. \nGIN Real ones? \nMAC Gem quality.  First ever.  God save Japan. \nHe toasts Blessed Japan to the East.  Takes a hit. \nMAC A diamond reactor takes graphite, runs it through a combination of lasers, electron beams, and scanning- tunnel mg microscopes. \nHe means this.  She is transfixed. \nMAC This one uses krypton-fluorine laser, with a new isotope of krypton. \nShe looks down at the diamonds in his palm.  His fist CLOSES. \nMAC The atoms are rearranged.  And the molecule of graphite becoznes a molecule of... \nHe turns his fist UPSIDE-DOWN.  And LETS GO!  She GASPS as the brilliant stones FALL toward the sea.  Watching, watching, long after the moonlit glimmer has evaporated.  A hush. \nGIN I hate it.  When you make a point. \nINT. SHIKOKU MARU - DAY \nCLOSE on two open PASSPORTS.

Each stateroom has a peg, which can be moved to ABOARD or ASHORE.  Mac moves the peg for 16... \n...to the ABOARD position. \nAnd off they go. \nINT. SMALL PLANE - NIGHT \nMac in his jump suit piloting the Dehaviland DHC-53 across the endless black of the Indian Ocean.  For the moment, he seems alone. Then... \nMAC Down there.  Ten o'clock. \nHe means a tiny grouping of LIGHTS.  Way down there, against the darkness.  He switches on the AUTOPILOT.  Goes back to... \n...Gin, waiting in her jump suit, sitting on a large pack of gear just beside the window of the jump door.  Next to her, a pack that is even larger.  No fear in her eyes tonight.  Pure adrenaline. \nGIN Are you dumping fuel? \nMAC Changed my mind.  There's nothing on the instruments downrange.  The longer she flies before she ditches, the less chance they notice on the Bridge. \nAs she stands, he begins to strap the huge pack ONTO her body. Jesus.  With her chute, and the other gear attached, the load makes us uneasy.  Not her. \nMAC You should lose the oxygen tank at 8000 feet. \nGIN And how do I judge that?  Babe's intuition? \nHe points to an altimeter device on his wrist.  It says 12,000 feet.  She cuts him a look. \nGIN So I just ask you on the way down? Or were you planning to e-mail me. \nHe pulls out an identical device.  Strapping it to her wrist... \nMAC I hate a crybaby. \nHe straps the even-larger gear pack to himself.  Checks the path of the tiny lights far below.  Then, looks in her eyes... \nMAC (simply) You can do this. \nNot merely reassurance.  Affection.  Something connective between them.  You are my partner.  Her eyes send back that personal bond, and she nods.  I can do this.  Good girl. \nHe pulls on his oxygen mask, goggles.  She does the same.  He OPENS the door, air BLASTING in.  One more look down below, and he holds up ten fingers.  Counts them down, nine...eight... \nShe moves to the edge.  Watching him.  And on zero, she... ARCHES out INTO the starry VOID, and we go... \nWITH HER, the incomparable RUSH of freefall, straining to see him FOLLOW, skillfully altering his position to gain on her, coming close.  She is looking between him and her altimeter, as... \n...his oxygen tank FALLS AWAY, and she CUTS hers loose, the air RUSHING past her, she looks DOWN... \n...the lights below are beginning to take the shape of the freighter.  Back up to Mac, as he... \nPULLS his CHUTE, it is black and square, and JOLTS him to what seems like a full STOP far above her, and she YANKS her cord, but... \n...nothing.  It doesn't open.  She is ROCKETING down, looking back up to see Mac make an exaggerated CUTTING sign across his body, and she closes her eyes, PULLS her secondary chute, which... \nPOPS open, JARRING her violently, and she GASPS with the shock.  He is well above her now, she isoff course, frantically trying to manipulate her trajectory, seeing him swooping closer, the freighter LOOMS in distance, she looks down and suddenly... \n...the sea is RUSHING at her, she FIGHTS her braking mechanism, SHOUTING at herself... \nGIN FLARE, FLARE... \n...and SLAMS INTO the water, PLUNGING down, twisting, disoriented CUTTING her chute loose, struggling not to get tangled, in a panic to BREAK her light tube, which... \n...GLOWS yellow-green, illuminating the freezing depths, she FITS it around her head, fights now to pull out the small ELECTRIC FAN we've seen before, KICKING herself toward the surface, fighting against the weight of her gear pack, she... \n...flips the switch, and the fan becomes a PROPELLER which ROCKETS her upward, but she loses her hold on one handgrip, tries desperately to hang on with one hand, but it... \n...PULLS FREE, goes SHOOTING off into the blackness without her, one instant of TERROR in her eyes, and... \nMac is THERE, diving at her with his propeller, she GRASPS his legs in a death grip, and suddenly, they are... \nAT the surface, Gin GASPING for air, and he CUTS his propeller, CRADLES her body with one strong arm, murmuring in her ear... \nMAC It's over, it's over... \nHer eyes are wild. \nMAC Catch your breath, quickly. Hang on for the wake. \nShe sees the FREIGHTER now, a black mountain CUTTING the sea, a huge WAKE pluming from its bow.  She grabs his waist with all she's got. \nGIN DO IT! GO! \nAnd he KICKS the propeller to LIFE, they ZOOM off, straight AT the towering wake and burst THROUGH it, RACING to the freighter's looming hull, speeding alongside, Mac looking up to find... \n", "test3_input": "Gin is hanging onto the cable, petrified.  Mac is looking up toward the roof. \nGIN Okay, now what? \nMAC (absently) Shut up.  You're on a 'need-to- know' basis. \nGIN Mac, I'm sorry. \nHe looks at her.  Just now, she seems more miserable than afraid. \nGIN Turns out, I'm a screw-up. \nHe doesn't smile.  Passing the third canopy. \nMAC Well.  Something to be said for being self-aware. \nLooks back up.  Forty-first floor.  Six to go. \nMAC May I have the last grenade, dear. It's about to rain. \nShe blinks.  Huh?  So he reaches into her bag, pulls out the grenade, and THROWS it... \n...STRAIGHT up.  The roof above them EXPLODES in a FIREBALL, and SHIELDS her body against the wall of their shaft, as a huge SECTION of roof comes RAINING down.  We watch as it... \n...CRASHES through the upper canopy, TONS of roof and glass PLUNGING to... \n...BLAST through the middle canopy, everyone below SCRAMBLING for shelter, as the whole shebang... \n...EXPLODES through the lowest canopy.  Gin can only GAPE at the incredible display.  Mouthing a silent WOW. \nThey've passed the second canopy, thirty-sixth floor.  Still climbing.  The other two elevators maybe five floors below us. \nMAC You see, banking will be more democratic under China. \nShe looks to him. \nMAC Well.  No more glass ceiling. \nThe elevator car has STOPPED.  We are at the roof.  The soldiers are in the car beneath our feet, nowhere to get out.  Above our heads. \n...the last few feet of elevator cable.  And starry sky, where our patch of roof used to be. \nMAC How refreshing.  The night air. \nHe begins to shimmy up the few feet of cable.  At the top, he reaches out with one hand toward the lip of the remaining roof, GRABS it, LUNGES with his free hand, and... \n...DANGLING 47 floors, he pulls himself UP, swings ONTO the roof. Reaches back down.  She is only twelve feet below him.  Frozen with fear. \nGIN I can't do this. \nMAC You can.  If I say so. \nShe stares up at his eyes.  He smiles. \nMAC If you stay.  You'll have to pay for the damage... \nShe looks down at the mess below. \nAnd starts to climb the cable.  Not so easy in a ball gown, but the adrenaline is pumping.  Gets to the top.  Here's the hard part. One hand reaches out... \n...GRABS his.  She lets GO.  And she is DANGLING in space. \nMAC Now that split.  Did we say \nAnd with all his strength, hauls her up onto... \n...the roof.  Two-thirds of it remain.  At the far edge, a gigantic MAINTENANCE CRANE, itself two stories high.  But between here and the crane... \n...a HELICOPTER.  Big and beautifUl and empty.  She looks like she's seen God.  Mac starts to jog toward it, she runs to follow but sees him go... \n...straight PAST the chopper. \nGIN HEY! \nHe turns back. \nShe points to the copter.  It's over here. \nMAC Got the keys? \nOh. \nGIN I thought you could...hot-wire stuff? \nGuess not. \nMAC They fix those things so you can't steal them... \nAnd keeps walking.  Toward the monster CRANE. \nMAC These, they're not so worried. \nMoving fast, he points off to his right.  Her eyes follow a long CABLE, leading from the arm of the crane, across the roof, attaching by a huge HOOK to a massive WRECKING BALL. \nMAC Go grab that hook. \nHe reaches the crane's cab.  Turns back to see she hasn't moved. \nMAC Let me rephrase that.  Run and grab that hook.  Or die... \nGot it?  She takes off running.  He hops IN the cab.  PUSHES the start button.  It rumbles to life.  Tests some levers... \n", "test3_true": "He turns to see that he's tightened the cable, pulling her ball six feet in the AIR.  She clings to the hook with a true death grip. He lowers her ball to the roof.  Getting the hang of it. \nMAC This only works if you shut your eyes. \nWhich makes her eyes BUG OUT. \nGIN You're not gonna lower me over the side. \nMAC Of course not.  Now close baby eyes... (she won't) Suit yourself. \nHe THROWS a lever and the crane's arm begins to SWING in a circle, finally taking the ball WITH it, and as she SCREAMS, Mac... \n...POUNCES out of the cab, RACING along the edge of the roof, NOT toward the ball which is sweeping the hysterical Gin in a widening ARC, but toward the point where he thinks the ball will clear the edge, and JUST as it does, he... \n...LEAPS aboard, throwing one arm around the hook, the other around her, and they go... \n...OVER the side, WHOOSHING DOWN in a gigantic, every-increasing LOOP, as the endless steel cable UNWINDS from its huge drum like a fishing reel hooked onto a killer whale. \nGIN OH NOOOOOOOOOO.... \nThe ride no theme park could insure, SWOOPING out ACROSS the skyline, DROPPING like an anvil, as the cable UNSPOOLS hundreds of feet, nothing but NOTHING for miles below them, Gin grabbing a breath to SHRIEK her guts out, as the monstrous pendulum reaches its max, begins to slow toward that one nauseating motionless instant... \nMAC Let go NOW!! \nHe YANKS her loose, and they drop... \n...four feet.  The ball SWINGS OFF lnto space to some unknown mayhem.  Clutching Mac, Gin looks WAY down to the street, and realizes they are standing on... \n...a rooftop.  Quiet, safe.  Alone. \nMAC Planning. \nShe WHIPS around, GLARING death at his eyes. \nMAC And dumb luck. \nShe COLLAPSES in his arms, every muscle trembling in spasm, sobbing... \nGIN God, I hate you. \nHe holds her tenderly.  Kisses the top of her head. \nMAC (softly) Good.  I hate you, too. \nEXT. NATHAN ROAD - EARLY MORNING \nWITH Gin in a soft brunette wig, walking briskly, light carry-all across her shoulder.  Very early, even the busiest street in the world is less than that at this hour.  Up ahead... \n...Tsimshatsui Station, a tall man with a tourist shopping bag, leaning casually against a pole.  Talking into a cellular. \nAs she approaches, Mac doesn't seem to notice, but she can now hear his conversation... \nMAC (into phone) ...if I can't have my usual suite, I'll take my business to the Bristol, simple as that. \nHe sees her now.  Smiles small. \nMAC (into phone) ...why indeed should I be more loyal to you than you've been to me?  Think it over. \nSNAPS the phone shut. \nMAC You ran your calls. \nShe did.  She is frankly exhilarated. \nGIN All the transactions, all the transfers.  It's a miracle. \nMAC Why?  The CD erased the trans- actions, all accounts seem in order.  It looks like the thieves were stopped in time. \nShe sighs.  It is a miracle. \nGIN The Colonel says police have nothing.  A man in black-tie, a blonde in a gown.  The elevator guards saw faces, but no mug shots to ID.  I think it's over. \nMac's smile.  Bittersweet affection. \nMAC Except it never is, really. Quite.  Over. \nShe smiles.  It is easy, but dazzling.  Atypically soft. \nGIN Well, one hopes not.  The Bristol, huh?  In...Paris? \nAh. \nMAC You're not going back to Mr. Cruz, and the nine-to-five? \nGIN Not hardly.  I've arranged to be killed in a car crash.  On Taipei. Amazing how little it costs. \nMAC Well.  You want to watch those pennies. \nShe takes a breath.  Scared, in an excited way... \nGIN I could arrange for two.  In that crash. \nHis smile back. \nHe looks at his watch.  Takes her hand.  Leads her to the subway steps. \nMAC You know, for a bitch.  You can be awfully sweet. \nGIN Woman of mystery.  What do you say? I like the Bristol, just fine. mean, it's not the Ritz... \nMAC You know, all night I've been wrestling with something... \n"}

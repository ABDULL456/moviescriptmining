{"test1_input": "...a series of metal RUNGS, which begin twelve feet above the water line, climbing the dizzying height to the freighter's deck, far above.  Mac has a Kevlar rope with a GRAPPLING HOOK, and as he reaches the rungs, he... \n...THROWS it high, one of the pronged hooks CATCHING on a rung twenty feet above them... \nMAC HOLD TIGHT! \nGIN IF YOU FUCKING INSIST! \nAnd he LETS GO of the propeller, PULLING both of them, laden with gear, OUT of the water with sheer brute strength.  PLANTING his feet against the outward curve of the hull, he CLIMBS with all his strength, hand over hand, until he finally... \n...GRASPS the bottom rung.  He PULLS them up, until she can GRAB ON.  They hold tight to their rung for a beat.  He attaches them both with metal carabiner clips. \nMAC If I were you, I'd watch the desserts. \nGIN Boy, I'll bet you were in shape before you got old. \nMAC Too long ago to remember. \nAnd pulls himself up to the second rung, so that he is standing an the first.  Offers her his hand... \nGIN I can take it from here, thanks. \nSuit yourself.  They begin to climb up the rungs, like a tilted backwards ladder, re-attaching their clips as they go. \nGIN If you'd packed my primary chute right, I wouldn't ha... \nMAC Yes, you would.  You're a girl. \nUp, up.  And stop.  They are nearly halfway to the top.  Looking across the curved hull to... \n...a large circular HATCH.  Thirty feet away.  The goal.  Mac pulls from his pack... \n...their SUCTION CUP gear.  With practiced speed, they fasten cups to the balls of their feet, take hold of the hand rods with cups attached, and Mac takes the lead as they begin to... \n...move LATERALLY across the hull's surface toward the hatch.  Mac is amazingly agile at the arduous process, scuttling sideways like a crab across the precariously tilted-back hull.  Gin is deter- mined, but falls well behind, intent on making every suction seal solid one.  Dark water RACES by beneath her.,  By the time she looks up at the hatch... \nHe is gone. \nMAC (O.S.) Anytime you're ready. \nShe looks UP sharply.  He is ABOVE the hatch, attached to the hull by the balls of his feet, hanging down like a bat.  Noting her astonishment... \nMAC Better angle. \nThat it is.  He has pulled a thick cylinder from his pack.  It's a battery-operated AIR WRENCH, and with a menacing WHIRR, only partially masked by the ship's wake, he begins to swiftly POP all the rivets around the hatch. \nGin has pulled out the slender WELDING TOOL we saw in the shower, and begins CUTTING through the metal seals around the hatch's rim. \nAt thecrucial moment... \nMAC You might want to move aside... \nWhich she BARELY does, as the hatch door PLUMMETS past her to the sea.  BIG splash.  Gone.  When she turns back, Mac is already THROUGH the opening and she follows, their yellow-green headlamps partially revealing... \n...the maximum-security HOLD.  We've seen this with Carlsby.  The fork lift.  The shadowy multitude of PLATFORMS on their gimbals, all SWAYING, in different directions with the plunging of the ship. Gin just stands, staring everywhere, like she's broken into Fort Knox.  The ROAR of the engines is louder here, and he moves close to her to speak beneath it... \nMAC May I trouble you for the torch? Or would you rather just dance. \nOh.  Slightly embarrassed at her lack of split-second efficiency, she tries to find the thing in her gear.  After watching her fumble for a bit... \nGIN I know I packed it. \n...he just reaches in and pulls it out.  A small LANTERN which he FLICKS on, brilliantly ILLUMINATING the entire hold.  Scans the platforms...polnts to a CRATE wrapped in 4-ply heavy duty plastic membrane. \nMAC Coal into diamonds.  A wealth machine. \nGIN How do you know that's it? \nMAC (as if stating the obvious) It's 12 by 9 by 7 feet.  And it's the only thing worth waterproofing, in case the ship sinks. \nGIN (softly) ...you twit. \nMAC Hmmn? \nGIN I'm just finishing your sentence. Can't you answer a question with- out making me feel stupid? \nHe's heading toward the swaying platforms... \nMAC Why would I bother? \nHe is climbing onto a lower platform, easily vaulting up to the magic crate.  She follows, but it isn't as easy as he's made it look.  She has to scramble, almost falling.  He's already pulled from his gear... \n...six rubber POUCHES.  She hands him her welding tool, and he begins attaching the pouches to the top and sides of the crate. \nThe plunging ship has the platform really rocking. \nGIN (concerned) They don't look like flotation bags... \nMAC (working fast) Shit.  Well then, let's forget the whole thing. \nShe stares at him. \nGIN Okay, it was a dumb ques... \nHis eyes come UP.  So fast that her breath stops.  He looks plenty angry. \nMAC Let's get one thing straight.  I don't work with partners much, because basically, I find most people to be idiots. \nShe swallows.  Hard. \nMAC You, in contrast, are first-rate. \n", "test1_true": "MAC And if I think so.  Maybe you should start thinking the same. Now move your ass. \nAnd goes back to work.  She pauses a beat.  Then pulls out two lengths of Kevlar rope.  Begins securing their platform to the one above, to minimize the amount of sway.  As she struggles with this, she sees him finish by welding a very small gray BOX to the top of the crate. \nWhen he glances up, he sees her staring at the box. \nMAC GPS transponder.  Sends a scrambled signal by satellite... \nHe touches the device.  It BEEPS.  A light glows RED. \nMAC Precise coordinates.  You could find a golf ball in the Gobi Desert. \nHe rises.  JUMPS down to the floor. \nGIN Where you g... \nMAC (walking away) Fork lift. \nGIN That's my assignm... \nMAC (turning back) Unless you've got the keys, someone has to hot wire it. \nOh. \nMAC Finish up on the floaters. \nAnd heads off toward the fork lift.  Finish up?  She looks at the rubber pouches.  They seem finished to her.  Tugs at a couple. On pretty firmly.  Across the way, we HEAR the fork lift turn its engine OVER. \nGIN Won't they hear it? \nMAC (O.S.) Over these engines?  Through five feet of steel? \nShe hurriedly secures the last of her Kevlar lines. \nMAC (O.S.) Hell, if they do, they don't have the second key to get in. \nHe is driving up in the rickety fork lift.  Weaving around crates and equipment. \nMAC Thank God for redundant security. \nHe hops lightly from the fork lift, reaches up, and she jumps down INTO his arms.  Quickly, the switch places, Gin climbing into the idling fork lift, as Mac clambers up to UNBOLT the crate's pallet with his air wrench... \nGin moves the fork lift into position.  Mac bracing his legs against neighboring cargo, using all his strength to hold our crate steady.  He is really straining. \nGIN How many tries do I get? \nMAC (with effort) One, before I beat you senseless, dump you over the side, and donate your share to charity. \nShe brings the fork UP.  The crate sways slightly.  She lines up her prongs against the pallet's receiving holes... \nGIN You gotta work on that impatient streak. \n...and slips them straight IN.  First try. \nGIN (amazed) How professional. \nShe LIFTS the crate, but the boat LURCHES, and she nearly LOSES it off the fork. \nBut she doesn't.  SWINGS her load around now.  Heading for the open hatchway, the roiling sea racing by.  Picking up SPEED, slightly... \nGIN Uh.  Thing on the left is the brakes? \nMAC (laconic) Or the thing on the right. \nBy now she is really ROLLING toward the wide open spaces... \nGIN MAC, IT'S JAMMED! \nHe POUNCES off the platform, FLYING after the lift as it ACCELERATES THROUGH the opening... \nMAC JUMP, for God's sa... \n...TIPPING at the hatchway lip, the crate sliding OFF the prongs, our forklift TUMBLING OUT the hatch to the sea, just as Mac... \n...SNATCHES Gin by her HAIR, pulling her FREE of the falling forklift, CATCHING the rim of the hatchway with his free hand, Gin SCREAMING in fright and pain, BLINDLY grabbing his arm to be... \n...jerked BACK to safety. \nClutching Mac, she watches the sea behind them.  Where the crate and the forklift disappeared. \nMAC You did activate the floaters. \nHer head WHIPS around.  Aghast. \nGIN Activa... \nMAC I did say, 'Finish up on the floaters'.  Surely, you heard me. \nHer life.  Flashes before her eyes.  As behind the ship... \n...the crate BOBS to the surface.  We can see the tiny red light on the transponder from here. \nMAC (softly) Oh.  Guess I did it m'self. \nShe WHIPS back, and starts POUNDING at him with her fists.  He is laughing so hard, he takes a few good shots before he can GRASP her wrists.  She SPITS in his face.  He strikes back by... \n...kissing her hard.  She struggles for a beat. \nAnd then she lets him. \nWhen they finish, he reaches to UNZIP her jumping suit.  All the way.  Pulls it down gently, revealing... \n", "test1_id": 834, "test2_input": "...her evening gown.  A wrinkle-free material which slips down across her legs from where it had been bunched across her hips. He is unzipping his outfit as well, revealing formal wear of his own.  He stuffs the suits into his gear pack, removing only... \n...her evening bag and shoes.  Then lifting both packs, he... \nGIN Um... \n...FLINGS them into the black ocean.  Gone. \nGIN ...I wouldn't do that. \nSo he turns.  She looks really stunned.  And scared. \nMAC Excuse me? \nGIN Well...I saw our suction things. Lying...over...there? \nShe points.  To where no suction things are lying. \nGIN (a mouse) ...so I put 'em in my pack? \nHis eyes WIDEN. \nGIN Or maybe.  I put 'em there. \nAnd points.  To where they are. \nShe tilts her head.  Gives him a great smile.  Is he enraged?  His dry grin says, not hardly. \nMAC I like a quick study. \nThen again.  You can never tell. \nEXT. FREIGHTER DECK - NIGHT \nExpansive barely-lit deck under a canopy of stars.  A silver-haired couple in immaculate evening attire stroll alone, he is humming to barely-audible dance music from a distant lounge.  She clings to his arm, it is romantic.  Until they reach the railing where he turns, and says something quietly in German... \nShe stiffens.  Pulls her arm away from his.  She sneers coldly, calls him a name in German, and he UNLOADS on her, a barrage of German-language INVECTIVE that would melt a tank.  She absorbs the abuse without flinching, turns toward the rail, HAWKS and... \n...SPITS over the side.  Strides away from him.  He watches her go. Then... \n...SPITS over the side himself.  And follows her. \nHalf a beat. \nMac's head APPEARS above the rail.  Just where they spit.  Not a mark on him. \nINT. BALLROOM - NIGHT \nOur old German couple are DANCING wonderfully in each other's arms Inspiring.  PAN a dozen really old couples dancing to the three- piece Filipino ensemble, until we come to... \nGin and Mac spinning slowly, flawlessly, their eyes telling the surrounding geezers that they are very much in love.  We CLOSE to hear their sweet murmurings... \nMAC ...no matter how many stones we make, the diamonds are just an appetizer. \nGIN (dreamily) And the meal...? \nMAC My contract.  With DeBeers. \nShe blinks.  Hit by a ton of bricks. \nGIN Oh my G... \nMAC Sensible folks, DeBeers.  A world monopoly in diamonds based on one simple principle...something's only priceless if it's scarce. \nHe WHIRLS her in a tight spin.  The geriatic Germans can only watch and envy. \nMAC These guys dig up all the diamonds on the planet, just to keep them out of circulation.  Otherwise, you could buy 'em at the Five and Dime... \nGIN Watch the old guy stuff, they don't have dimestores anym... \nMAC Imagine the chaos we could cause. \nShe is imagining. \nGIN You said 'contract'... \nMAC We're sort of bounty hunters. \nGin likes the ring of that.  Green eyes dance with delight. \nMAC Our machine is worth far more dead.  Than alive. \nVOICE (O.S.) Glad to see you're both alive. \nThey look over.  The officious STEWARD from this afternoon.  Now in black tie. \nSTEWARD When you missed cocktails.  And supper.  I thought of knocking on your door... \nMac turns Gin so that she can send the boob a lazy smile... \nGIN Oh, I wish you had.  We love having strangers join us!  Maybe later...? \nMac turns her once more, so that he faces the flummoxed steward across her bare shoulder... \nMAC Promise you an interesting time... \nTrademark smile. \nMAC Or my name's not Banquo MacDuff. \nYou twit. \n", "test2_true": "Our couple moving down the softly-lit hallway, past the burnished doors of luxury suites.  Her arms wrapped around one of his, their bodies close together. \nMAC ...well, I would ask what you're doing with the rest of your life. But that's your own bloody affair, isn't it? \nShe sighs. \nGIN Yeh.  Anyway, before you get too choked up on the farewell.  I feel I owe you a confession. \nHe glances down.  Really?  Really. \nGIN Time has come to tell you.  What business.  I'm actually in. \nHe thinks about this.  And then... \nMAC Not here. \nEXT. DECK - NIGHT \nMac leads her along the empty moonlit deck to... \n...the BOWSPRIT, a long, narrow platform, ringed by a flimsy rail, it juts far out above a churning sea.  The whipping of the wind makes it seem all the more precarious. \nMAC It only looks dangerous... \nHolds out his hand.  She hesitates. \nMAC You couldn't fall off.  Unless someone threw you over. \nGives her the smile.  She puts her hand in his, and they hop UP to the platform.  Walk its length to the very end.  He turns now, leans casually against the fragile railing.  They are inches apart. \nMAC More intimate.  For a confession. \nGin looks down at the plume of wake leaping off the bow. \nMAC What business.  You are actually. In. \nShe looks up.  To his eyes.  Into them. \nGIN Yeh.  I'm not an art dealer. \nMAC Of course not.  You're a cop. \nAnd tilts his head.  Just to one side. \nMAC An insurance investigator for Webber Assurance, your boss is an idiot named Hector Cruz, you've been there four years and ten months, you're quite the rising star. \nGIN (evenly) Nope. \nHis head tilts.  Just a little farther. \nMAC (very softly) Nope? \nGIN I'm a thief, Mac. \nHolds the look. \nGIN For five years, I've used the database of every client Webber has to plan my jobs.  Museums, banks, jewelers, rich people, I have floor plans, alarm codes, passwords, the works. \nHis face absolutely neutral.  Unreadable. \nGIN I've made a fortune.  It's not enough. \nMAC Why n... \nGIN Why wasn't it enough for you? \nHe falls silent. \nGIN The Vermeer that was stolen from Hancock Tower?  That was my job. I scaled the building with electromagnets, and parachuted down an air vent... \nNo smile at her lips.  Strictly business. \nGIN ...after mailing the painting.  To where we're going next, actua... \nMAC (quietly) We. \nShe looks him up and down. \nGIN Yeh, we.  You passed the audition. \nNow he smiles.  First time. \nMAC (a murmur) Imagine my relief. \nGIN I need a partner.  For the biggest, smartest, job.  Ever.  The one you retire off of, because nothing else could ever compare with the rush. \nMAC Ever.  Is such a long time. \nGIN This is a job that can only be done in one place, in one split-second in human history.  If we miss that instant.  We lose. \nMAC And it's worth...? \nGIN Eight billion dollars.  That's eight thousand million. \nMAC How much in shillings? \nGIN You're not a real trusting guy. \nMAC And I tried so hard to hide that. \nGIN It's two jobs.  The first steals something priceless from the National Palace Museum in Taipei.  We don't keep that.  We trade it in for our ticket to the show. \n", "test2_id": 835, "test3_input": "MAC One moment in time, you s... \nGIN Midnight, July 1, 1997.  Eight days from now.  The moment that Hong Kong is annexed by china. \nAnd now.  She has his interest.  She can see that. \nGIN 80-20 split. \nMAC Don't be so hard on yourself.  It's your plan, you should take at least thirty perc... \nGIN My 80, your 20.  Asshole. \nHe thinks this over. \nMAC 50-50.  Or you can swim to Taipei. \nShe is not impressed.  Or afraid.  He grins... \nMAC What are you gonna do with six billion dollars that you can't do with four? \nGIN Hold the record.  Alone. \nThis.  He likes.  So much that he leans to kiss her, with surprising tenderness. \nMAC Your share is 50%.  And one dollar. \nHer hard stare.  And then, she smiles.  Just barely.  Still in his arms... \nGIN I like what you left.  In the hold. \nMAC You didn't even see wha... \nGIN A lump of coal.  A pair of pliers. A note that said, 'Squeeze hard'. \nThis is the most taken with her that he has ever looked.  She leans up and kisses him.  Whispers... \nGIN Squeeze hard. \nEXT. STREET, SHIHLIN DISTRICT, TAIPEI - LATE NIGHT \nUgly section of an ugly town.  Unmarked warehouses, alleyways teeming with food stalls.  HEAR a motorcycle approach, and see... \n...Gin driving, Mac sits behind her.  Going real fast, maybe she's showing off, we FOLLOW them DOWN a blind alley, as she smoothly WHEELS them into... \n...an open FREIGHT ELEVATOR.  She climbs off, he doesn't.  As Gin goes to work the controls, Mac sees a cat curled in the corner, mewing softly. \nGIN That's Madame Chiang Kaishek, she's my bud.  An evil streak a mile wide. \nThe elevator JOLTS to life. \nMAC No surprise. \nThey CLANG upward.  Mac seems utterly relaxed.  Gin paces a little, hugging herself.  Her features tense. \nMAC (gently) Tired? \nShe blinks up.  He is straddling the bike.  Smiling at her. \nGIN I have a lot on my mind. \nAh.  Well... \nMAC You look beautiful doing it. \nHe seems to mean that.  And it seems to melt her a little.  She sags against the wall, closing her eyes, as... \n...they JOLT to a stop.  She PULLS the heavy LEVER, and the door SLIDES noisily open, to reveal... \n...a gigantic LOFT.  She flicks on a dim light, but we see only part of the cavernous space.  She strolls, Madame Chiang trotting along behind.  Mac follows, looking around, then down to see... \n...a pile of MAIL, cables, packages.  The unopened MAILING TUBE we saw in the Hancock Tower penthouse.  He crouches, lifts the tube in his hands... \nGIN (O.S.) You wanna buy a Vermeer? \nMAC Rather steal it. \nGIN (O.S.) Been there, done that. \nHe nods to himself.  Guess so.  He rises to see her framed against the gaping starlit opening of a huge LOADING DOOR.  The twinkling island lies below.  But here, Gin stares down at... \n...an elaborate architectural MODEL.  Fifteen feet across, it features an imposing yellow, pagoda-roofed BUILDING, built into the side of a model MOUNTAIN.  Formal gardens, fountains, tiny Kuomintang flags.  Stretching away from the building, a large portion of the CITY, with shops and alleyways elaborately detailed. As Mac joins her... \nGIN National Palace Museum, Taipei, Taiwan.  Repository of four thousand years of Chinese culture... \nHe bends to lift UP the detachable roof.  All the rooms are detailed within, down to exhibit cases. \nGIN Works of gold, bronze, jade, onyx, pots and scrolls, paintings and porcelains and lacquer work.  Every treasure the Kuomintang could loot before the Reds took over. (beat) Ever rob the place? \nMAC No.  If memory serves. \nShe takes him by the hand, and leads him toward the gaping doorway, walking straight toward it... \nGIN You need to eat something, or are you ready for sex? \nAnd just at the edge of it... \nMAC (torn) The options seem so limited. \nThey jump THROUGH the opening.  And VANISH. \nOur ANGLE closes on the doorway, to see OUT now, sitting like a jewel against the hillside... \n", "test3_true": "...a loading PLATFORM, suspended above the island, only a few feet below our opening.  Like a balcony without a railing.  Mac and Gin already sinking down onto a waiting futon. \nLooks like he's made his pick.  Among limited options. \nINT. LOFT - SUNRISE \nCLOSE on the MODEL MUSEUM in early light.  Propped against it, the unrolled Vermeer.  Pinned to the painting, a note we can't read.  In the B.G., HEAR what sounds like the rattling of a SUBWAY TRAIN, which runs a short distance and STOPS.  We TILT ANGLE now, to see... \n...through the sunlit opening of the loading door.  Mac's head APPEARS, peeking up over the lip. \nMAC Ginny...? \nLOST in another brief subway rumble.  He lightly VAULTS up through the doorway.  Looks around, no Gin.  Goes to the model.  Lifts the note pinned to the Vermeer... \nMAC (reads) This lovely parting gift can be yours.  If the price is right. \nStumped.  Not in his cultural database.  He looks at the model, to see that the stretch of city between museum and mountain has been lifted away, revealing... \n...an underground RAILWAY TUNNEL between the two.  Mac examines the tiny train, the tracks, the winding route.  From the side walls, well above the tracks, huge VENTILATION PIPES open onto the tunnel. Starting at the museum end, they are labeled VENT #1, and so on. There are five.  The last one shortly before... \n...the mountain.  Where a cavernous opening is labeled BARRACKS. Tiny toy soldiers kneel on a landing, rifles in position to shoot at the oncoming train.  And as Mac studies this curiously... \n...the nearby SUBWAY RATTLES the walls once more.  Sounds like it's in the room, somehow.  Mac rises.  Saunters across the loft, and we see for the first time the enormity of this space.  Suddenly, the floor ends, and we are looking down nearly thirty feet onto... \n...a spacious HANGAR, outfitted with 150 feet of RAILWAY TRACK, at the far end of which sits a full-sited TRAIN CAR, exactly like the one in the model.  And just below us... \n...Gin crouches on a concave platform of corrugated metal, eighteen feet above the track.  She holds a remote control device, which she uses to REV the train's engine, far down the line.  She looks really tense. \nMAC Good morning. \nShe startles slightly.  Shuts OFF the train's engine.  As she looks up to him now, the silence is noticeable.  He crouches down, only a foot or so above her... \nMAC Quite a parting gift.  I would have settled for roses. \nGIN It's a joke.  You know, a joke? People who have a sense of humor make them? \nHe's clueless.  But smiling. \nGIN You're rich, go buy an American, have him fill you in on the culture. \nMAC Ah.  American culture.  Well, that is a joke. \nHe leans down.  Strokes her hair very gently. \nMAC (murmurs) Relax.  It's only eight billion dollars. \nShe looks up into his eyes.  But she can't smile. \nMAC (softly) Your Vermeer?  I like this View Of Delft better than the larger one. The sky is more emotionally rendered. \nStaring in his eyes.  And just as softly back... \nGIN Nice.  When a sky is that. \nHe holds the look.  Very strong and very gentle... \nMAC Is it easier now? Not pretending. \nIs it? \nMAC Not pretending you're an innocent. Not pretending you...like me. \nNo answer.  Effortlessly, he hops down to join her.  Never losing eye contact. \nMAC Here's a tip from an old-timer. Never forget who you are... \nSettles next to her.  Bodies touching. \nMAC It gives you someone to be.  When you stop pretending. \nOkay?  She nods, slowly.  Her eyes moving over his face.  Maybe more feelings going through her than she can sort out. \nMAC (still soft) So.  Our train runs from the museum, through an underground tunnel.  To a mountain. \nGIN Because the museum displays 10,000 relics at any given moment.  But there are 60 times that many, stored in the mountain. \nThis overwhelms.  Even Mac. \nGIN Which is why it's guarded.  By an army. \nShe is unfastening the small pack at her feet... \nGIN The train shuttles relics to and from storage.  It looks exactly like that. \nSo Mac looks down the line.  At the train car. \nGIN I've been down the air ducts four times.  The train always has two armed guards.  Always travels between 32 and 36 miles per hour.  Relics don't like to be jostled too much. \nMAC (all business now) Your model has five vents. \nGIN We go down the first.  Back up the third, if you're lucky.  If not, we have to get out by the fourth. \nMAC (simply) Then we will. \nShe pulls from the pack four thick DISCS, each about eight inches in diameter, each with a toggle switch and a wrist loop.  She starts to put two of them on... \nGIN Electromagnets, incredibly powerful. This switch is on-off. \nHe gestures at the train, the track, the hangar... \nMAC Seems like overkill.  For one simple jump. \n", "test3_id": 836}

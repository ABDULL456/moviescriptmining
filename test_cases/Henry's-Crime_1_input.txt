EDDIE Relax, old man. Henry and I go way back. We've known each other since high school, isn't that right? 
HENRY Yeah. I know you. 
EDDIE Appreciate you keeping your mouth shut, Henry. One thing I admire in a man is the quality of loyalty. 
HENRY What do you want, Eddie? 
EDDIE Nothing. Just the American dream. 
CUT TO : 
MAX AND HENRY At the window. Looking down as EDDIE gets into his car. He senses them watching him. Turns around. Gives them the thumbs up. 
INT. APARTMENT - SAME TIME 
Max and Henry watch Eddie leave. 
MAX I'm gonna kill him. With a knife. 
HENRY You can't kill him. 
JOE (slurred, on the floor) Yeah. You can't kill him, Max. He's got the vault -- 
MAX Shut up, Joe. 
He looks over at Joe on the floor. Thinks about how easy it would be to just kick him in the head. 
JOE Deb says we can't have sex till the kid's born. Says the kid'll know about it. 
MAX Go home. Please. Before it's too late. 
CUT TO : 
INT. STAGE - DAY 
Henry in period costume. He has a beard. He watches from the stalls as they run a dress rehearsal. 
TROFIMOV I'm sorry to be blunt, but, for God's sake, the man has robbed you. 
MADAME RANEVSKY (stopping her ears) No! No! No! Don't say that! 
TROFIMOV He's a scoundrel: everybody knows it but you. He's a petty scoundrel, a user... ON HENRY, feeling like the accused. From the stage Julie sees him. 
MADAME RANEVSKY You are twenty six or twenty seven, and you're still in the lower grades! 
TROFIMOV Who cares? She locks eyes with Henry now : 
MADAME RANEVSKY You ought to be grown up by now. At your age, you ought to understand about love -- 
DAREK Where are you, Djula? Where?! 
MADAME RANEVSKY (with double the fire) You ought to love someone yourself! You ought to have an affair. Yes! Yes! 
DAREK Yes. Yes. Good Djula! Scene. 
(THEN) Carlotta and the girls. 
(MORE) 
DAREK (CONT'D) 
(A CLAP) Let's run the magic scene! Julie walks off the stage. She knows Henry is waiting for her. 
HENRY What happened last night? 
JULIE I came to my senses. 
(THEN) And you should too. She walks on. He follows... 
HENRY We should talk about it. She turns. 
JULIE I don't want to, Henry. 
INT. DRESSING ROOM - LATER 
Henry arrives to find Max attaching one of the bags of dirt to a pulley. Above them, Joe begins to hoist it up through the open skylight. Henry looks up. 
MAX (tugging the pulley) Three feet of it so far today. We'll make it. Henry goes to the open doors of the Armoire. The tunnel is deeper now and all lit up... 
EXT. PARKING LOT BEHIND THE THEATRE - LATER 
Henry, Max and Joe make their way toward Joe's car. 
JOE What do you think guys? If it's a boy do I cut him or not? 
MAX Well, you know what they say, cleanliness is next to Godliness.

ON THE LEAD CAR OF THE PROCESSION - The Woman's jaw is practically on the floor. 
WOMAN You son-of-a-bitch! I want a ivorce!

EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY 
The hearse drives past a sign that says ENTERING ASPEN, COLORADO. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DOWNTOWN ASPEN - DAY 
The boys stroll down the sidewalk, looking in the windows, studying the passersby, taking in the sights and sounds of the ski town. 
LLOYD Isn't this wonderful? What more could a couple of single guys like us ask for? 
HARRY How about food and shelter? 
LLOYD You're so materialistic. (beat) Why don't we get down to business and eliver the briefcase to Mary. Who knows, maybe she'll invite us in for tea and a strumpet or two? 
HARRY Jolly good idea, chap. And where oes the lovely young lady reside? 
LLOYD Um... good question. 
Harry throws Lloyd a concerned look, but then notices a phone booth next to them. 
HARRY Well what's her last name? We'll look it up in the phone book. 
LLOYD Hmmmm... You know, I don't believe I caught that either. 
Harry's concern grows. HARRY What about the briefcase, Lloyd? There must've been a name on it, right? 
LLOYD (brightening) Come to think of it, there is. It's engraved right into the leather. 
HARRY What is it? 
LLOYD Samsonite   spelled just like it sounds. 
Harry starts flipping through the phone book. Then abruptly HE STOPS and puts the book down, a DEFEATED look on his face. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HEARSE - NIGHT 
The car is parked in a parking lot across the street from a picturesque bridge. Harry and Lloyd are shivering in the front seat as a LOUD, ICY WIND WHIPS though the hearse. They're each spooning something out of a coffee cup and sipping it. 
HARRY Any soup left? 
LLOYD A little. Shall we share it? 
HARRY Please. 
Lloyd opens a TINY KETCHUP PACKET and squirts half of it into Harry's cup and the other half into his. They pour a few drops of water in and mix it with their spoons. 
LLOYD Mmmm mmmm good... 
Lloyd smiles bravely at Harry. Harry notices something and leans toward him. 
HARRY Hey, you got something stuck in your front teeth. Lloyd picks a small speck out of his mouth and studies it. 
LLOYD Hmmm... looks like an old piece of Beef Jerky. 
HARRY STARES AT IT. THEN: 
HARRY Wanna split it? 
LLOYD You're pathetic. Get your own. 
Loyd puts the floss-meat back in his mouth and chews it. Another gust of wind swirls around them. 
HARRY I'm freezing my ass off, Lloyd. 
LLOYD Roll up your window. 
HARRY It is rolled up. 
LLOYD Then I guess the damn anti-cold system isn't working. You really should get it fixed if we're gonna live here all winter. 
HARRY What anti-cold system? 
Lloyd points to the dash.

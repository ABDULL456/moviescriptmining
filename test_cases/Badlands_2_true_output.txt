ROUGHNECK Maybe. 
KIT Well. I'm sorry. sir. but we've got to ask you for it. 
Holly walks over to inspect the rig. 
KIT (o.c.) See, we're about out... been driving all night. Actually, I don't even have time to explain it to you. 
ROUGHNECK (o.c.) Well, matter of fact, I don't have any. 
KIT Just a second now. That's your truck. isn't it? 
He points to a truck linked to the front of the trailer. Holly looks idly around. Suddenly her expression changes, for what reason it is not clear. 
KIT (o.c.) You didn't walk out here. 
ROUGHNECK (o.c.) It's mine all right. 
KIT Well, listen. I'm going to swap you my Cadillac. 
The Roughneck does not understand what Kit is up to. 
KIT Now don't worry. You're getting a fair deal. Hell. what's the blue book value on this thing, Mildred? 
He slaps the hood of the Cadillac and looks to Holly. She is still preoccupied with whatever it is she has seen, though. 
ROUGHNECK (o.c.) Who are you? 
KIT Name is Carruthers. Believe I shoot people every now and then. Not that I deserve a medal. 
Holly signals Kit with a nod at the horizon. 
HOLLY Kit! 
Kit looks up and sees a helicopter in the distance. He hesitates a moment, then draws his gun. 
KIT Okay, friend. start running. 
ROUGHNECK (o.c.) Just gimme a chance. 
KIT Git. 
Holly moves around the side of the rig and sits against a tire. Kit joins her. 
KIT Boy. I had a feeling today was going to be the day... Helicopter. 
HOLLY Yeah. 
KIT He's not coming to take us for a ride. either. Come on, let's make a run for the car.

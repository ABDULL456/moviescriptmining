Half-glancing at Drayton as he delivers his sermon. Ben talks to Jo. Their conversation is whispered. 
BEN That's Buchanan's phone number. Go on out and call him and ask him to surround the place with police. 
JO What if he asks me... 
BEN Tell him...tell him everything. This is the time. I'm sure Hank is around here some place. 
JO Ben, I don't want to leave you. 
BEN I don't know how else to do it, honey. 
Ben gives her a gentle push. With a regretful look at him, she slides out of the seat. 
INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT 
In the middle of his sermon, Drayton looks up. He almost falters and stops, as he sees Jo rise from her seat. 
The chapel as seen from Drayton's viewpoint. Jo has turned up the aisle and gone out the door at the back.

Drayton composes his face, but his eyes are serious. Without the slightest pause, he continues his sermon, shifting his ideas in mid-paragraph. 
DRAYTON Few of us pause to think how life's adversities work in our behalf, to make better men and women of us. (MORE)

DRAYTON (CONT'D) But I believe we should pause now to do a little stock-taking -- to look into our own hearts and see what we find there. Therefore instead of continuing the service, I think we should all return to our homes for private meditation, remembering how little we have to complain of and how much to be grateful for. Next week I shall discuss the fruits of our meditation. Until then, my blessing upon each and every one of you. 
INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Ben watches Drayton, with little charity in his heart. There is a stir in the congregation when Drayton tells them to go home. They look at each other, uncertainly. 
INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. SHOT 
Drayton closes the Bible, and begins to descend from the pulpit. The congregation comes to life. The members rise from their seats and begin filing out of the chapel. Occasionally they cast backward glances toward the pulpit, as if surprised at what they have heard.

When Drayton reaches the two steps of the altar, he beckons the organist to him. She comes, and he whispers something to her. He then motions his wife nearer to him, and also whispers something to her. Mrs. Drayton goes off through a side door by the altar, while the organist makes her way down the aisle through the congregation to stand by the door.

The CAMERA PANS Ben as he threads his way up through the women who are filing out. Drayton stands at the front of the chapel, waiting. Finally, after a slow and deliberate walk up the now nearly empty chapel, Ben comes face to face with Drayton. Drayton greets him with bland amiability. 
DRAYTON Well this is a pleasant surprise, Doctor. 
BEN Where's my boy, Drayton?

DRAYTON He's upstairs. As a matter of fact you've just come in time to help my wife with Hank's food. Seems Hank doesn't care much for English cooking. 
Drayton's eyes stray to the back of the church as he talks. Ben, noticing Drayton's eye movement, follows it cautiously. But before he can confirm his suspicions, there is a loud clang of a door closing that gives him his answer. He looks around quickly.

At the other end of the chapel, the woman, Edna, has just closed the door, and is in the process of locking the heavy iron lock with a large key. She extracts the key and puts it into her pocket.

Ben turns back to Drayton to find that his manner has changed somewhat. He grabs him quickly by the throat of his robes. 
BEN What do you want? I'll give you money and keep my mouth shut. All I want is my boy. 
DRAYTON And what about your wife? Did she go outside just to get some fresh air. 
BEN Tell me what you want.   I'll do anything. 
DRAYTON All right -- you'll see your boy in good time. 
With a sudden twist, he wrenches himself away from Ben. He reaches for a button on the altar, presses it. Instantly the door by the side of the altar opens and two rather strong men appear. Ben turns alertly to face them, backing of a little.

One of the men is obviously the chauffeur type, and the other one, a handyman type in his shirtsleeves. Ben takes this in, and notices the open door behind them. Ben maneuvers himself toward the pulpit, and suddenly dashes for the steps.

He surprises them with his speed, and before anyone can stop him, he is in the pulpit. He grabs the microphone previously used by Drayton in his sermon. He yells into it. 
BEN Hank! Hank McKenna!    Hank!   Where are you? Hank! Hank! 
As the sound roars through he chapel the two man dash for the pulpit, and at that mount we hear, faintly off, the voice of Hank: 
HANK Daddy!   Daddy, I'm here!   Dad - 
His voice is choked off. Ben jumps down from the pulpit in an effort to make for the open door, but the two men throw themselves on top of him.

Jo speaks into the phone with great urgency. 
JO ...And Ben is in there now, watching the both of them! 
INT. SPECIAL BRANCH OFFICE - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT 
Woburn, assistant to Buchanan, is listening intently on the phone. The office behind him is not handsomely appointed. Jo's voice is heard on filter. 
J0 He sent me out to call you -- so we could do something before they get away. 
WOBURN I see, Mrs. McKenna -- and you believe your son is somewhere in the chapel? 
JO I don't know, I don't know where he is...but at least these people will know -- the Draytons. If you'd only send somebody to get them. 
WOBURN I'm afraid it isn't quite as easy as all that.

J0 Mr. Woburn, there isn't any time! My husband is sitting in that chapel waiting for me to bring some help. Can't I talk with Mr. Buchanan? He said when we needed him, to call. 
INT. SPECIAL BRANCH OFFICE - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Woburn is concerned. 
WOBURN I'm awfully sorry, but I simply can't get hold of him just now. He's gone to a rather important diplomatic affair -- at the Albert Hall.

Jo is tired of his talk.   She wants action.

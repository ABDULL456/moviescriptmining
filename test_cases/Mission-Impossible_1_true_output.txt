MATTHIAS You wish to meet Max?  This is the price of admission. 
Reluctantly, Ethan pulls the hood over his head and the car takes off. 
INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DAY 
The black hood still on his head, ETHAN has trouble sitting upright.  He's before a desk, in an apartment somewhere in the city -- it's impossible to tell where, as the blinds are drawn.  The place is roomy and lavishly furnished -- expensive Oriental rugs, well-chosen objects of art. 
Somewhere down the block, a dog BARKS, steadily, every few seconds. In the hallway outside the apartment door, someone is VACUUMING.  MATTHIAS and the OTHER MAN are nearby. 
ETHAN I thought I was going to see Max. 
MATTHIAS You misunderstood.  No one sees Max. 
ETHAN Then what am I doing here? 
MATTHIAS Allowing Max to see you and hear what you've got to say. 
ETHAN I don't communicate very well through a shroud. 
MATTHIAS If Max doesn't like what you have to say, you'll be wearing that shroud indefinitely. 
ETHAN I'm willing to take the chance. 
MATTHIAS Very well. 
MAX'S figure into frame.  MATTHIAS removes ETHAN's hood. When it comes off ETHAN finds himself looking up at a tall woman of indeterminate age.  She's handsome to the point of severity. 
MAX Who are you and what are you doing here? 
ETHAN I need one hundred thousand dollars. 
MAX Really?  And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you? 
ETHAN Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand. 
MAX The penny drops.  You are not Job.  Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is not playful.  So you're something of a paradox. 
ETHAN That depends. 
MAX On what? 
ETHAN Whether you like a paradox.  I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars. 
MAX It's quite out of the question. 
ETHAN The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's bait, part of an internal molehunt. 
MAX And how might you know that?  Are you another Company man? 
ETHAN Like Job? 
MAX Ah, but, we're asking about you. 
ETHAN I'm NOC.  Was.  Now disavowed. 
MAX Why, may I ask? 
ETHAN That's the question I want to ask Job. 
MAX I don't know Job any more than he knows me. 
ETHAN Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction. 
MAX Why should I? 
ETHAN Because I can deliver the actual NOC list.  The one you have is not only worthless, it's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location. 
MAX It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and see if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir. 
ETHAN Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits. 
MAX (Pause.) Mm - Hmmm... 
ETHAN Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner you used in the car?

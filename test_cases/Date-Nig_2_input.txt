PHIL 0 yeah? Who else are you "in touch" h on Facebook? 
CLARA 
O PHONE) Hello? Holbrooke? Thank God you're there. It's Clara Foster... 
INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER THAT NIGHT 
HOLBROOKE PETERSON, a thoroughbred of a man in his mid- 30's, opens the door to his candlelit apartment with a smile to find Phil and Clara. 
HOLBROOKE Wow! Clara! You look exactly the same 
CLARA So do you! He gives her a big, tight hug, lifting her a little. 
HOLBROOKE You feel exactly the same too. Phil double-takes. Did he hear him right? 
R1 U 
CLARA This is my husband, Phil. 
HOLBROOKE Ah! The man who actually landed Clara. Holbrooke gives Phil the up and down with a winning smile and holds out his hand. 
HOLBROOKE (CONT'D) Philly Cheese Steak. Nice to meet you. 
PHIL Um... yeah... I don't go by... it's 1 - usL Phil. Nice to meet you, too. 
HOLBROOKE Well, c'mon in. If you don't mind, take off your shoes. 
CLA. A Oh.Sure. 
HOLBROOKE Cutsdown on the cleaning. Which cuts downon the use of all those chemicals andplastics, blab blah blah. Reduces my 
CF. 
PHIL 
CF? 
HOLBROOKE Carbon footprint. 
PHIL Oh. The environmental thing. 
HOLBROOKE 
(CHUCKLES) Yeah, the "environmental thing," Phil. As they walk into the apartment in their socks, they notice the whole place is filled with reclaimed and recycled furniture and LIT WITH CANDLES. 
CLARA How beautiful. Or, the candles... Did we 
ERRUPT SOMETHING- Oh, no. I jus-_. --'-D.> myself off the gr a few weeks ago. 
PHI The grid? 
HOLBROOKE Power grid. I actually have a negative carbon footprint now. Making up for, you know, all you "Phil"-i-stines in the suburbs. Holbrooke chuckles. Phil's about to say something when a look from Clara reminds him to bite his lip. Holbrooke gestures to some cardboard furniture. 
HOLBROOKE (CONT'D) So have a seat. Holbrooke starts to sit down himself, then makes a show of taking a LARGE GUN out of his shoulder holster and putting it on the table. 
PHIL Whoa. You carry that around at home? 
HOLBROOKE Yeah. I'm supposed to sleep with her under my pillow. 
(SHRUGS) Wish I didn't have to, but I just see it as... I carry the weight so citizens like yourselves don't have to. 
CLARA It's so funny. I always knew you'd end up doing something in public service. 
HOLBROOKE 
(SHRUGS HUMBLY) I don't know. That's lust how I Phil looks to Clara - can you get a load of this guy, but Clara's focused on Holbrooke. 
HOLBROOKE (V.0.) (CONT'D) Yeah, unfortunately, Terrence Stockton is not a man you want to get on the wrong side of.

DILLON (derisively) 
Shit, you trying to tell me Blain and Hawkins were killed by a fucking lizard?  Don't listen to her.  Its's a psych-job. Two, maybe three of them, that's                   * all.  We keep our cool, out-think                  * them 'til we're across the                         * border...                                          * 
Ignoring him, Schaefer takes her hands, drawing his COMMANDO KNIFE, looking squarely into her eyes. 
SCHAEFER What's you name? 
She looks back into his eyes.

ANNA Anna. 
SCHAEFER Anna.  He's hunting us.  You know that? 
She nods.  With a sudden movement he slices through her bonds. 
DILLON What the hell do you think you're doing? 
SCHAEFER We're going to need everyone.                      * 
DILLON What are you talking about? We'll be out of here in ten                        * minutes.                                           * 
SCHAEFER We're not going.                                   * 
DILLON That rendezvous is ten maybe                       * twelve miles, at most!  We're                      * almost home.  But the chopper                      * won't wait. 
Schaefer turns to face him. 
SCHAEFER Dillon...This thing doesn't                        * care who we are, who she is. We make a stand or there won't                     * be anyone left to make that                        * chopper. 
Dillon stares back, not wanting to hear what he already knows to be true. 
Anna touches Schaefer's arm. 
ANNA There is something else.  When the big man was killed, you must have wounded it. (pause) It's blood was on the leaves.

She touches her pant leg, the stain is faded but still there.  Schaefer turns to Dillon. 
SCHAEFER If it bleeds, we can kill it. 
115     EXT. ENCAMPMENT - MORNING (LATER)                    115 
Anna at the base of the rocks scans the jungle with binoculars watching the tree line.  Mac moves past her, uncoiling a trip wire linking up four CLAYMORE mines hidden at various points with leaves and foliage.  In a tree at the edge of the clearing, Billy tosses an uncoiling roll of wire to Ramirez who attaches it to a GRENADE, wedged it the crouch of a tree. 
Wires attached to GRENADES and CLAYMORE MINES lead off through the underbrush and trees leaving a long, unmined corridor leading from the camp and into the jungle. 
At the corridor's end, where the rocks merge with the jungle, Schaefer hauls down on a HEAVY VINE, straining with every ounce of strength, his muscles bulging, while Dillon takes up the slack of the vine

around the base of a tree.  The vine is attached to a forty foot SAPLING, arcing closer to the ground in a gigantic bow with every pull, CREAKING and GROANING with tension.  With a last mighty heave, Schaefer draws the tree almost within reach, gesturing to Dillon to        * tie it off, who does.                                       * 
DILLON (straining) I'm tellin' you, this little                       * 'boy scout' stunt is a                             * Godamned waste of time.                            * (stands)                                    * We've got to get the hell out                      * of here, now, while we've still                    * got the chance. 
Ignoring him, Schaefer rapidly drags into position a NET crudely woven of differing sizes of vines, their LEAVES still attached.  He carefully begins to cover the net with leaves and debris.  Dillon watches him in growing frustration as Schaefer moves quickly, picking up a FRAMEWORK of STICKS he has tied together, a TREADLE-SPRING TRIGGER.  He holds up the framework, hurriedly examining his work before placing it on the ground. 
SCHAEFER He'll be looking for the trip wires. If we're lucky, he won't see this.

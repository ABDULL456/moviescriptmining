They shake hands. 
LARRY You look awful. 
BEN Thanks Larry. 
LARRY You know, you should sleep at night. Come in... 
Ben follows him into the office. 
9   INT. DAY - LARRY'S' OFFICE                                    9 
Larry takes a seat and briefly looks over the messages and files that have been dropped off on his desk- 
LARRY So did you find an apartment yet? 
BEN No, not yet. 
LARRY You need a place to stay? 
BEN No, I'm staying at my sister's, in Queens. 
LARRY I didn't know you had a sister. What does she do? 
BEN She's a bartender. 
LARRY That's not too good for you! Anyway, you know you are always welcome to stay at our house. 
Larry looks up at Ben, slightly uneasy-

LARRY (CONT'D) I ran into Amy the other day. How are things going between the two of you? 
Ben remains silent. He obviously doesn't want to get into that subject. 
LARRY (CONT'D) So, why did you want to see me Ben? 
BEN You know what I want. I'm ready to come back, I'm feeling much better now. 
LARRY Listen Ben, I can't bring you back on the force. Nobody in the squad wants you around right now. I'm sorry but I have to be honest with you. You understand, right? 
BEN Larry, I'm telling you, I'm ready. 
LARRY If it was up to me, I would bring you back tomorrow, but I'm not the only one who decides. Listen, I think I've got something else for you. I know a guy at the Mayflower corporation and they need someone to watch over one of their department stores. 
BEN What?! Come on Larry, a security guard job... I'm not ready to retire yet! 
LARRY Hey! I'm just trying to help here. I know you're over qualified for that position but it's a good opportunity for you for the time being...until the situation here quiets down. Also the money is not that bad. 
Ben is having a hard time to contain his anger. 
LARRY (CONT'D) You need the money, Ben. You're in the middle of a divorce and you've got child support to cover. If you want to see your kids, you've got to get a job, any job. 
Deep inside, Ben knows Larry's right.

LARRY (CONT'D) Do you know the Mayflower on West 38th Street? 
BEN I do. The one that burned down? 
LARRY Yes, their night watchman hasn't shown up for work in several days. They need someone right away. Take it, relax, and we will talk about your situation again in a couple months. 
BEN Yeah, in a couple months... I gave everything for the NYPD. I almost died out there. Everyone seems to have forgotten that. 
LARRY I didn't.

10   INT. DAY- CORONER'S OFFICE                                     10 
We discover a whole different world- 
In the sterile environment of the NYC Chief Medical Examiner's Office, forensic scientists with tape recorders in hand, describe the corpses. 
We are a world away from the Hollywood clich√©s of neatly laid out, immaculate cadavers. Here, some of the corpses have reached a state of advanced decomposition and others are still frozen in contorted positions, expressing their ultimate agony before dying. From the homeless man fished out of the river, to the woman killed by gun shots, each corpse tells his own story... 
Amidst the group of doctors 35-year-old AMY, deeply immersed in an autopsy, is interrupted by her cell phone. 
Amy checks the display for the incoming call- BEN. She hesitates for a moment and doesn't answer the call. 
Amy goes back to the postmortem analysis on her tape recorder. 
11   EXT. DAY - NEW YORK                                            11

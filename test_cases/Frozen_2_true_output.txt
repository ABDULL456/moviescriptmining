R surfers where they get hit from behind and they don't even know what happened. (beat) You know. Cause it like came up 
A from beneath them. (beat) Like on the Jaws poster. 
LYNCH The chick on the Jaws poster was 
M hot. 
PARKER She was? 
LYNCH I don't know. She was naked. Naked chicks are hot. 
D DAN But if you actually like saw the fin coming for you in the water. That would be worse than actually 
E getting eaten. Knowing that this animal is coming for you but you can't get away. And that it's going to eat you. Like you're gonna get eaten alive? Have you guys ever seen that footage of the great white jumping out of the water to eat that seal? 
LYNCH That's why I only swim in pools. 
PARKER I think burning to death would be the worst. 
LYNCH Well yes and no. Because most people die of the smoke inhalation before any fire even hits them. 
PARKER I remember watching TV for like 3 
X days straight after 9/11. That footage that they kept showing of all of those people leaping off of the top of the Trade Center? Can you imagine how bad it was inside 
R to know that jumping was a better way out? 
LYNCH But they say that when you jump 
A from that high up your heart stops before you hit the ground and you don't even feel it. 
PARKER OK, then Lynch. What is the worst 
M way to die? 
LYNCH (defensive) What? 
PARKER No, you have an answer for 
D everything. What's your biggest fear? 
Lynch has been waiting for this. 
E LYNCH Easy.   The Sarlaac pit. 
PARKER The what? 
LYNCH The Sarlaac pit. From Return of the Jedi? Hel-lo...being slowly digested over 1,000 years? Worst. Death. Ever. 
DAN (teasing) "I don't know why I never have a girlfriend, you guys!" 
LYNCH Shut-up. 
The wind starts blowing again and Parker nestles close to Dan. 
PARKER 
X Why hasn't it started again? 
DAN Give it a minute. 
R LYNCH This is nothing man. At Stowe last year, me and Solet were stranded for like 25 minutes. This big chick fell getting off up top and 
A twisted her leg. It was like- "move her to the side and keep the line going people". But no. They had to stop and celebrate it right there and we all had to- 
M BOOM.   The lights go out. 
A21   EXT. MOUNT HOLLISTON - CONTINUOUS                           A21 Across the mountain all of the trail lights go out, one by one. 
D B21   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS                                B21 They sit in darkness. 
E At first no one can speak. 
Dan reacts first. 
DAN (yelling) WHAT THE FUCK??!    HELLO???!!!! 
LYNCH Come on now! This is messed up. 
PARKER HEY! TURN THE LIGHTS BACK ON! HELLO!!!! 
Dan tries to laugh in frustration. 
DAN Are they fucking kidding?

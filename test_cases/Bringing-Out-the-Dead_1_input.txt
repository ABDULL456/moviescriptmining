DISPATCHER Sixteen XRay, a man at the bus terminal shot three years ago says his arm hurts. 
Frank looks at a group of girls exiting an after-hours club: every one a Rose. Rose faces. 
FRANK C'mon, Tom, pick up a job. 
WALLS You want some bum in the bus terminal? We'll wait for a real call. 
FRANK Let's get in a fight, then. 
WALLS Who with? 
FRANK That's your job. Just keep driving, keep moving. No stopping. We're sharks. We stop too long, we die. 
Walls hits the accelerator: the old bus jerks forward: 
FRANK (CONT'D) Let's break something, Tom. Let's bust something, bomb something. 
WALLS What do you want to break? 
FRANK (taking a drink) I don't know--let's break some windows. 
WALLS Why? 
FRANK Destruction, distraction. I feel the need. 
WALLS You need a reason, Frank. You don't just go around breaking people's windows. That's anarchy. 
FRANK What's the reason? Give me a reason, Tom. 
WALLS Let me think. 
Tom hits the siren as he swings wildly around a stopped cab and its turban-headed driver: 
WALLS (CONT'D) Classic cabbie move. (to driver) Hey, swammy, that's called a crosswalk. You stop before it, not on it! 
Walls turns onto a cross street, spots Noel standing by a Mustang, baseball bat on his shoulder. He wears yesterday's blood-stained clothes, cut tires tied to his shoulders and elbows, chest and belly wrapped with steel wire. 
WALLS (CONT'D) I know who to work over. Him. 
Walls slows as Noel lifts the bat, swings it into the Mustang's front window, shattering it, puts the bat down, using it like a cane as he walks to the next parked car. 
WALLS (CONT'D) This guy's been terrorizing the neighborhood for weeks, ever since he got outta jail, wreaking general havoc, contributing to the bad name of the place. The term "menace to society" was made up for him. 
FRANK He's crazy. He can't help it. 
WALLS (stops ambulance) Well, why don't they put him away? Prisons don't want him. I took him to the hospital yesterday and here he is again. 
Noel reaches the next car, a Bronco, carefully hefts the bat, smashes it through the windshield. 
WALLS (CONT'D) Look at that. Tell me that's a crazy person. Every move is calculated. He knows exactly what he's doing. This is the guy. I've been after him for weeks. He's quick, runs like a rat, tough for one person, but with two of us-- 
FRANK Okay, whatta I do? 
WALLS If he sees me, he'll run, so I'll get out here. You start talking to him about baseball or something while I sneak around behind and get down and you push him. When he falls we get him. 
FRANK That's ridiculous. 
WALLS Believe me, it always works. The simpler, the better. 
FRANK You learn that in the army? 
FRANK (CONT'D) Flatbush.

The Masseuses help Uncle Billy out of the Jacuzzi. They say their goodnights and Ted closes his eyes. When he opens them, Ginger stands at the edge of the tub. 
GINGER Want some company? 
Ted can barely nod. She unzips the back of her dress and lets it fall to her feet.  The silhouette of her nude body is startlingly gorgeous in the moonlight. Ted watches as she descends, step by step, into the frothy water. 
Ted's paralyzed with desire and fear. Ginger descends deeper. A wash of foam caresses her breasts.  She continues.  Until she's completely submerged. 
Ted looks startled.  The "Jaws" theme echoes through his ears.  He starts to rise. Concerned. When suddenly, he feels something.  Whoa! His swimming trunks land next to him. 
He starts to rise out of the Jacuzzi, when suddenly he's sucked under.  He thrashes.  His hand grabs the edge of the Jacuzzi. But his fingers give out.  And he slides under. Only to rise out of the water with Ginger. Attached to his lips. Kissing him passionately. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - TED'S BEDROOM - MORNING 
Ted and Ginger in bed.  Morning rays, satin sheets, what a night.  Ted awakens.  He stares at Ginger in awe, remembering what happened. Smiles big. 
Ted slides out of bed.  Catches his reflection in the mirror. Takes a good look at himself. 
TED (posing; cool) Who's your daddy? 
INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - DAY 
Press Conference. Lights, cameras, reporters, bedlam. Uncle Billy, Helen, and Ted sit at a makeshift dais. 
UNCLE BILLY ...My brilliant, extraordinary nephew, Ted Nelson, has brought enough fresh blood to this company to make all of Transylvania happy for the next fifty or sixty years. I'll give him the mike now and you'll see what I mean. This apple didn't fall far from the tree. 
Ted prepares to speak. A little nervous from the spotlights, but hell, he's a man now. Uncle Billy gives him a reassuring look. 
UNCLE BILLY (CONT'D) (whispering) Don't forget to tell them all your qualifications. 
TED I'm Ted Nelson. I guess you already know that part. (proud of himself) For two years I've been the editor of the high school paper in Xenia, Ohio. I've won some awards, made a difference. I've always had journalism in my soul. Now I know why. 
He glances at Uncle Billy, who urges him to tell more. 
TED (CONT'D) They tell me I've got my father's taste in women and cars. (winking) The faster, the better. 
CHUCKLES from the crowd. Uncle Billy gives him a "thumb's up" sign. 
TED (CONT'D) And I'm really looking forward to the challenge of bringing "Heaven" magazine into the 21st century.

INT. NELSON FAMILY ROOM - SAME 
Ted's parents and little Jimmy stare in amazement at their old-fashioned console RCA.  A geeky high school picture of Ted appears on screen, as a REPORTER babbles... 
BABBLING REPORTER (ON TV) The big question now remains: Will success spoil Ted Nelson, the straight-A journalism student from Xenia, Ohio, whose life was transformed overnight when he found out he was rich, powerful, and certainly the most eligible bachelor in the entire nation? 
MOM (shocked) Our Teddy inherited "Heaven?" 
DAD He said he was set for book money. 
Jimmy turns to his parents. 
JIMMY Mom, Dad. Forget about roller blades for my birthday. I'd prefer a DNA test. Can you prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that I am not, for example, a Guccione? 
The door bell CHIMES. Mom and Dad look at each other. This can't be good.

FLAEMMCHEN What have you been doing all day? 
BARON Chasing around. 
FLAEMMCHEN Chasing what? 
BARON Money. 
They dance a few steps, in silence. 
FLAEMMCHEN You were very different yesterday. 
BARON Yesterday -- yes -- that was yesterday. 
They dance into the crowd. 
CUT BACK TO: 
BAR 
DOCTOR Well, Mr. Kringelein, are you getting what you're looking for? 
KRINGELEIN What, Doctor? 
DOCTOR A masculine paradise -- drink, the ladies, dancing... 
KRINGELEIN I had a very good opportunity, a young lady asked me to dance -- I ought to be able to dance, it seems to be very important. 
DOCTOR You must learn as quickly as your time allows -- Believe me Mr. Kringelein, a man who isn't with a woman is a dead man. 
KRINGELEIN Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you all alone in the world. 
DOCTOR (quietly) I'm always alone -- I have been everything. 
KRINGELEIN Everything? 
DOCTOR I was sent as a military surgeon to South Africa. Stinking climate. Taken prisoner. Home on parole not to fight. I was a surgeon in the Great War till the end. Grenade in the face. Carried diphtheria bacilli in the wound until 1920. Isolated two years. (pause) I've been everything. 
The music has stopped. 
CUT TO: 
BARON AND FLAEMMCHEN ON DANCE FLOOR 
FLAEMMCHEN That was lovely. 
BARON Will you do me a big favor? 
FLAEMMCHEN I'll do anything for you. 
BARON Would you like to make a man happy? 
FLAEMMCHEN (quietly) Yes -- I'd love to. 
BARON Then dance the next number with Kringelein. 
FLAEMMCHEN Why? 
BARON I feel sorry for him. 
FLAEMMCHEN You're not a bit like you were yesterday. 
BARON I fell in love last night -- the real thing. 
FLAEMMCHEN Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist. 
BARON I thought that, too -- but I found that it does. Come along, dance with Kringelein. 
FLAEMMCHEN Anything for you. 
They move off. As they approach the bar, happily Preysing pushes into scene, touches Flaemmchen's arm. 
PREYSING Miss Flaemm. 
FLAEMMCHEN Hello! 
PREYSING I must speak with you, Miss Flaemm. 
FLAEMMCHEN (with the Baron) Presently, Mr. Preysing. 
PREYSING It's urgent. 
BARON Pardon me, the lady has urgent business here with me. 
PREYSING (to himself) Insolent -- Berlin manners. 
At that moment Kringelein has descended from the stool and crosses to Preysing. 
KRINGELEIN I wish you a very good evening, Mr. Preysing. You are staying here, too, Mr. Preysing? 
PREYSING I don't know you. 
KRINGELEIN Oh -- you must know me -- Kringelein at the plant. Assistant bookkeeper, building C, room twenty-three -- third floor. 
FLAEMMCHEN (quickly) Come and dance with me, Mr. Kringelein. 
PREYSING I must speak to you, Miss Flaemm -- business. 
FLAEMMCHEN (lightly) Tomorrow morning.

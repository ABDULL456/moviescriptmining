ALFALFA FIELD - NIGHT                                    A1 \nA slight breeze gently sways the green and purple crop. The CHIRP of CICADA is the only sound. \nSUPERIMPOSE:   1868 - ST. TAMMANY PARISH, LOUISIANA \nBut suddenly the CHIRPING GETS LOUDER and LOUDER -- BZZZZZ! -- until we realize it's not the cicadas, but a -- \nSWOOOSH! A lethal, razor-sharp DISC BUZZES up over the horizon, swoops TOWARD the CAMERA and OUT OF FRAME! \nThe CAMERA SPINS AROUND to see the disc flying away, chasing a man, THADDEUS MORTON, wearing a strange metallic collar -- exhausted, horrified, about to die. \nNEW ANGLE - MORTON \nHe looks over his shoulder, panting -- he's been running forever. \nMORTON (mumbling) Madman... Hideous spider... Run... Run! Warn the President... \nMorton zig-zags through a grove of trees, a desperate attempt to avoid the horrible serrated disc. But the ruse is futile. The disc goes straight through the trees, slicing a path straight as the crow flies. \nNEW ANGLE - OLD WAGON \ndilapidated, broken down, weathering away in the field. Morton runs around the wagon -- but the DISC BUZZES straight through the sideboards! Wood shavings spit everywhere! There's no stopping this thing. \nNEW ANGLE - MORTON \nrunning for his life -- stops, turns. He turns, incomprehensibly mumbling, pleading for his life, cowering. \nMORTON Noooooooo!!!!! \n(CONTINUED) \nWILD WILD WEST - Rev. 4/9/99                                2. \nA1   CONTINUED:                                                       A1 \nAnd the DISC SWOOSHES TOWARD the CAMERA -- BZZZZZZZ! \nCUT TO: \nBLACK \nDISSOLVE TO: \nNIGHT SKY FULL OF STARS - LOW ANGLE \nA man leans INTO FRAME. This is GENERAL McGRATH.      And he's there to collect the silver death disc. \nMcGRATH (to the unseen, dead Morton) And they says you scientists are supposed to be smart. \n1    EXT. DUSTY ROAD - LOW ANGLE - NIGHT                              1 \nHOOVES THUNDER by. Then bouncing, skidding wagon wheels. Up on the empty buckboard is a pair of murderous ex-Rebs. As the Rebs pass a pint of whisky, lash the six-horse team on, PAN WITH the wagon to see it's headed for... \n2    EXT. WATER TOWER - NIGHT                                         2 \nSALOON GIRL (O.S.) The legendary Captain James West and I finally got him all to myself. \n3    INT. WATER TOWER - NIGHT                                         3 \nWEST is bathing with the beatiful SALOON GIRL. \nWEST That's right, sugar, and you should feel free to treat him just bad. \nShe moves in and kisses him, long and hard. West hears the CLATTER of the APPROACHING WAGONS. He stops the kiss and peeks out the knothole. \n4    EXT. WAREHOUSE - WEST'S POV THROUGH KNOTHOLE - NIGHT \nDown below, West sees the wagon with the Rebs. \nWILD WILD WEST - Rev. 4/9/99                            3. \n5   INT. WATER TOWER - NIGHT                                      5 \nWEST (to himself) General McGrath's boys. I thought y'all was never gonna show up. \nSALOON GIRL Mister West, you wouldn't be here workin' tonight, now would you? \nWEST How 'bout some pants!? \nAs she throws the rest of his clothes down in a heap... \n12   INT. FAT-CAN'S - NIGHT (SAME TIME)                            12 \nGeneral McGrath checks a pocket watch, looks up impatiently at the Indian, Hudson. His eyes drift upwards... to the balcony where... \nANGLE ON UPSTAIRS BALCONY - TWO MORE EX-REBS \nhave come up back stairs lugging a heavy steamer trunk. \nMcGRATH I'm still waiting on my guns and ammo, but I see my men have brought your merchandise. \nMcGrath subtly gestures with his eyes to the balcony for Hudson to confirm. Hudson nods. \nMcGRATH I had expected to be delivering it personally to Mr... \nHudson quickly cuts him off before he can say the name. The Indian speaks in a very precise King's English. \nHUDSON My employer, here in a brothel? (a small ironic smile) That would be quite... redundant. \n13   EXT. STREET - ON CARRIAGE - NIGHT                             13 \nMOVE IN ON an elegant brougham driven by a very large, very striking woman in livery. \nAs the carriage passes under the gas lamp, we can make out the top-hatted silhouette of McGrath's \"employer,\" DR. ARLISS LOVELESS. Clustered around him inside the cab are three more beautiful women. As he strokes the cheek of the ORIENTAL one with the back of his hand like a cat... \n14   INT. FAT-CAN'S - McGRATH AND HUDSON - NIGHT                   14 \nHUDSON You'll meet him when the time -- and place -- are appropriate. Now... (stands) ... shall we go upstairs to check the 'merchandise'? \n(CONTINUED) \n14   CONTINUED:                                                     14 \nMcGRATH Frankly, Mr. Hudson, I wasn't planning to walk those oaken stairs with you. Direct me to the poot, sir. Something young and creamy. A gamer that takes to the crop and spur. \nMcGrath looks to the singer (Rita), who beats a hasty retreat from him after her song. So, once again, McGrath lays his rheumy eyes on... \nANGLE ON SOILED DOVE \nShe's oblivious, more intrigued by the ex-Rebs on the balcony with the trunk. As she starts for the stairs... a man's hand grabs her. It's the Eye-Crossed Reb again. \nEYE-CROSSED REB You drive a hard bargain, lady. All right, fifty cents to take them big juicy lips and... \nDORA Still not interested. \nShe tries to pull away.    But the Reb won't let go. \nEYE-CROSSED REB But you gotta be interested. You're a whore. \nSuddenly the coquettishness in the eyes becomes rage. The falsetto becomes a baritone growl. \nDORA (baritone) That doesn't mean a girl can't have high standards. \nJust as the Reb registers the odd new voice... wham!    Her corsage springs out and whacks him right in the jaw.    The Reb's eyes roll back... and he slumps to the ground. \nWhooa, hoss... the Soiled Dove is a man! He's ARTEMUS GORDON and his true profession will be revealed to us shortly. But now, as he/she stashes the unconscious Reb behind the bar, straightens bosom and wig... \n15   INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT                                         15 \nWest is trying to get dressed. \n(CONTINUED) \n15   CONTINUED:                                                    15 \nAs he pulls on one leg of his pants, a guard lunges at him with a knife. West hops up on one leg, smacks the guy with a mule kick. \nNow he puts his arm through his shirt sleeve. When the hand emerges out of the cuff, it's balled in a fist -- which coldcocks the other guard. \nWEST Could I have a little privacy here? \nAs if in response, the water tower, still hovering above, now crashes to the floor -- obliterating his opponents. \nWEST Thank you. \nHe calmly looks up in time to catch the falling, naked, screaming Saloon Girl in his arms. \nWEST You'll have to excuse me, darlin'... but my evidence is getting away. \nWest gallantly puts her down, jumps up, grabs the overhead block and tackle system and slides through the warehouse. As the HORSE TEAM, which has spooked, THUNDERS past... \nCLOSEUP - WEST \nsails onto the runaway wagon. As he pulls himself into the back, he gives the shivering Saloon Girl a tip of his hat -- now on his head. \nWEST Sorry about there not being any towels. \n16   INT. FAT-CAN'S - NIGHT (SAME TIME)                            16 \nGeneral McGrath   leers down a line-up of Fat-Can's girls. Just as he gets   to the beautiful singer, who looks sick at the thought,   suddenly Gordon intrudes. He/she blocks out the singer,   poses coquettishly -- sucking a lollypop. \nMcGRATH What's your name, missy? \n(CONTINUED) \n16   CONTINUED:                                                       16 \nGORDON/DORA (demurely; back to his falsetto) Dora. Would you like to go upstairs? \nMcGRATH Oh, indeedy I would. \n34   INT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY                                           34 \nWest limps past black floor scrubbers. They stop working to marvel at this handsome black man dressed in custom cowboy duds walking in there like he owns the place. \nBut not everybody's so impressed. As West heads toward the Oval Office, four self-important house detectives block his way. \nHOUSE DETECTIVE Whoa there, 'pardner.' (as West stops) Winning the war may have got you forty acres and a mule, but you can't just traipse into the President's office. Now gimme that gun. (CONTINUED) \n34   CONTINUED:                                                      34 \nHe nods at the six gun on West's hip. West coolly flexes his hand above it, like he's about to draw... \nWEST This gun? \nThen like lightning, with his other hand, he whips out a sawed-off shotgun hidden by his jacket. He pokes the 12-gauge barrels up against Pinkerton's surprised crotch. \nWEST Or this one? \nA voice stops the situation from escalating further. \nPRESIDENT GRANT (O.S.) Gentlemen! \nThe detective's head swivels around to see... \nANGLE - OVAL OFFICE DOOR - PRESIDENT GRANT \nstands in the doorway. \nPRESIDENT GRANT Don't make Captain West any later for his appointment than he already is! \nThe detectives back away from the hair-trigger cowboy as fast as they can. West reholsters the gun and continues... \n35   INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE                                  35 \nPresident Grant goes over to his desk, lights a cigar. Backlit in the haze, the portly bearded figure lives up to the myth. \nPRESIDENT GRANT Been a lot of death threats lately ... Cabinet made me hire some damn detectives. (by way of apology) Drink, cigar? \nWEST Thank you, sir. \nWest limps across the room to the bar, pours himself a glass of whiskey, takes a cigar out of the humidor. \n(CONTINUED) \n35   CONTINUED:                                                      35 \nPRESIDENT GRANT I hear you let General McGrath get away? \nNow West's blood is up. \nWEST Sir, I had him right in my hands when some half-a-sissy wearin' a dress ruined... \nPRESIDENT GRANT (cuts him off) Artemus Gordon. \nWEST You... know him? \nPRESIDENT GRANT Of course I know him, he's the best marshal I've got! He's a genius. (off West's incredulous look) Gordon has proven himself time and again as a very cunning operator with a rapacious intellect. Nothing will stop him from completing a mission for his President... except the impulsive actions of a headstrong cowboy! \nWest just looks at him soberly. Draws his gun and places it against the President's head. Grant's eyes widen. \nWEST Who are you? \nPRESIDENT GRANT I am the President of the United States! \nWest points the GUN to the ceiling and pulls the trigger. BLAM!!! As Grant jumps a foot and plaster rains down... \nWEST Wrong answer.    Who are you? \nPRESIDENT GRANT I am the President of... (as West cocks gun) ... I'm Artemus Gordon. \n(CONTINUED) \n35   CONTINUED:    (2)                                               35 \nWest lowers his gun, nods at Gordon's class ring. \nWEST The President went to West Point ... not Harvard. \nPRESIDENT GRANT (O.S.) Will somebody tell me what the hell this stunt is all about!?! \n36   INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - SIDE DOORWAY -                 36 PRESIDENT GRANT - DAY \n(the real one) stands in the doorway, hands on hips, surrounded by his house detectives -- their guns drawn. West nudges the fake Grant in the fake belly with his gun barrel -- go ahead. Sheepishly, Gordon starts peeling off his primitive, but effective, facial prosthetics. \nGORDON Sir, in perilous times like these, I was simply illustrating how someone impersonating you could actually walk right into the very bowels of the White House... \nJust as Gordon makes his intestinal allusion, West takes a ceremonial bayonet off Grant's desk and pokes a hole in the inflated bladder that was his fake paunch. The AIR HISSES out, finishes deflating with a flatulent R-R-RIP. (Hey, the first whoopee cushion?) \nGordon scowls at him. \nPRESIDENT GRANT You're clever, Gordon. One day it'll get you killed. \nWest smirks as Grant looks up at the bullet hole in the ceiling, then fixes West with a disapproving eye. \nPRESIDENT GRANT ... And you, West -- not every situation calls for your patented approach of shoot first, shoot later, shoot again -- then when they're all dead, try to ask a question or two. (shakes his head) Working together will be good for both of you. \n(CONTINUED) \nTHE WILD WILD WEST - Rev. 6/15/98                          21. \n36   CONTINUED:                                                       36 \nWEST AND GORDON But, sir, I work... \n39   EXT. C STREET TRAIN STATION - TRAIN ENGINE - DAY            39 \nFrom in front, as it CHUGS TOWARDS us. Sitting up in the spanking new steam engine (No. 5) is a white-haired Coleman. The Wanderer is his pride and joy. Coleman pushes the throttle forward and the ENGINE ROARS PAST us... followed by a tender, and two gleaming passenger cars. \nThen comes West THUNDERING past in a desperate effort to catch up. \n(CONTINUED) \n39   CONTINUED:                                                      39 \nANGLE - WITH WEST \nriding like hell. Getting the last ounce of speed out of his well-lathered steed, he finally pulls alongside the rear passenger car. He looks up... In the window, we see Gordon engrossed in what he's doing... which appears to be sewing. \nWEST Stop this train!! You hear me!?! \nIf Gordon hears him, he pretends not to.    He just casually makes the next stitch. \nWest's horse has had it. They're losing ground to the train. At the last second, West leans over at full gallop and grabs a handle on the side of the train. He swings out of the saddle, hanging on for dear life, blowing in the breeze like laundry. \nFinally, his boot finds a small metal plate to put its weight on. Just as West stands safely on it... whoosh! He flies up in the air and drops through a sliding partition in the roof. \n40   INT. WANDERER - PARLOR CAR - DAY                                40 \nThe car is like a classy Victorian men's club. Bar stocked with crystal decanters, a pool table, decorative pistols on the wall, books, etc. Gordon, seated in a club chair, looks over as West falls from the ceiling into a seat. He's hot, dusty and very pissed off. He glowers at Gordon murderously. \nGORDON (calmly) Thanks for dropping in. \nWEST Forget the bikes, the beards, the fake boobies. Put down the needlepoint and let's settle this like men! \nHe takes off jacket, starts rolling up his sleeves. Gordon remains remarkably cool, continues sewing. \nGORDON As a matter of clarification, this isn't needlepoint. This is. \nHe shows him some real needlepoint. \n(CONTINUED) \n40   CONTINUED:                                                      40 \nGORDON Right now, I'm putting the final touches on a new invention of my creation. I call it... The Impermeable. It's a vest that, when worn under the clothing, can stop any modern bullet fired even at close range. \nWest draws his gun, aims it at Gordon's stomach and cocks the trigger. \nWEST Really? \nGordon quickly pulls the vest away from his stomach. \nGORDON But it hasn't been really tested empirically yet. \nWEST Get up! \nWest takes off his guns and puts them on the table. \nGORDON (yawn, yawn) Guns. I find them so primitive and unnecessary... if one has done one's proper planning. \nWEST Yeah?   How do you feel about a fist? \nGordon puts down The Impermeable, stands with a weary sigh. \nGORDON I must tell you, Mr. West, I've always felt that allowing a situation to degenerate into physical violence is a failure on my part. \nWEST Well then, 'Mr.' Gordon, you failed. \nWhap! West unleashes a lightning punch that drives Gordon across the train car. He dabs at his bloody lip. \n(CONTINUED) \n40   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              40 \nGORDON I'm sorry, Mr. West, you brought this on yourself. \nThen to West's utter amazement, Gordon puts his hands together as if praying while at the same time, crooking his right leg stork-like. Is this some kind of martial art? Then, he bends at the waist, and like a ballet dancer, extends his leg out to the wall and flips a switch. \nIt immediately triggers a leather hammer to swing down from the ceiling. It whacks West on the side of the head, and sends him spinning back onto the pool table. \nANGLE ON POOL TABLE - WEST \nshakes it off and is about to attack again. Gordon calmly pokes a hidden button. Suddenly the pool table revolves. West is gone. \nGORDON I love this train! \n41   EXT. UNDERNEATH WANDERER - DAY                                 41 \nWest, eyes wide, is clinging on for dear life, staring at the ties racing by, inches from his face. \n42   INT. WANDERER - PARLOR CAR - GORDON                            42 \nGordon pours a fine Bordeaux, speaks loudly toward floor. \nGORDON The President asked for my suggestions on how to make the Wanderer both comfortable and functional... \nAs he swishes the wine in his mouth... \n43   EXT. UNDER WANDERER - DAY (SAME TIME)                          43 \nWest reaches up to get a handhold in the myriad of tubes and wires on the underside of the car. As he rips one tube out of the undercarriage... \n44   INT. WANDERER - PARLOR CAR - DAY                               44 \nGordon has just settled into the club chair, puts his wine down on the table. \nGORDON And while you're down there, you may want to avail yourself of my Sub-carriage Inter-rail Egressor... \nWEST ... West.   Jim West. \nDRAGON LADY Well... West meets East. Mae Lee East. (holds out delicate hand) Are you here alone, Mr. West? \nWEST Actually I'm, uh trying to surprise an old friend -- General McGrath. Seen him around anywhere? \nMISS EAST (DRAGON LADY) I don't believe that name was on our guest list. And I would know. I'm Dr. Loveless's personal assistant. \nThe name means something to West. \n(CONTINUED) \n54   CONTINUED:                                                     54 \nWEST Dr. Arliss Loveless...? One of the great founders of the Confederacy with Jefferson Davis. Funny how most people think he's dead. \nMISS EAST Tonight's his coming-out party. \nWe FOLLOW them as she takes his arm and leads him down the stairs, into the party. \n55   INT. LOVELESS MANSION - DOWNSTAIRS - PARTY - NIGHT             55 \nWest surveys the crowd. \nMISS EAST See anybody that looks familiar? \nWest scans the room.    Stops. \nWEST Matter of fact, I do. \nWEST'S POV - WOMAN WITH BIG HAIR \nShe's got the mole, too.    Gordon has apparently encored his Soiled Dove get-up. \nMiss East sees who he's looking at. She makes a pouty face as there's a flourish from the STEREO QUARTET. \nMISS EAST I'm... jealous. (blows a little kiss at him) Meet me later... in the foyer. \nWest watches as she joins... \n56   INT. LOVELESS MANSION - DOWNSTAIRS - PARTY - REST OF           56 LOVELESS' WOMEN - NIGHT \nMiss East leads them in a sober rendition of \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\" in front of a large doorway. \nDISTAFF CORPS (singing) 'Mine eyes have seen the glory Of the coming of the Lord...' \n(CONTINUED) \n56   CONTINUED:                                                      56 \nFrom behind the doors we hear the WHIR of an ELEVATOR. It stops with a CLUNK. Suddenly... \nNEW ANGLE - DOORWAY \nbursts open and Abraham Lincoln in a mini-float appears. It's decked out like Lincoln's box at Ford's theater. On its own power, it moves past the laughing party-goers in the foyer. Now the women throw grapes on the floor. \nDISTAFF CORPS (singing) 'He has trampled down the vintage Where the grapes of wrath are stored!' \nWEST'S POV - ANGLE ON WHEELS OF WHEELCHAIR \nare what's trampling down the vintage. West takes in the whole man. Very curious. Then suddenly... KABOOM! \nANGLE ON ABE'S HEAD \nIt explodes like a pinata. Up from the hole in his neck peeps... DR. ARLISS LOVELESS. \nLOVELESS (impishly) Don't you just hate that song? \nThe Southern crowd gasps at Loveless's dramatic appearance. \nLOVELESS Why, y'all look like you've seen a ghost! It's me, dear friends, alive and kicking! Well, alive, anyway... \nAs he giggles, the distaff corps surround him and remove the Lincoln paraphernalia. Then step aside, revealing... \nNEW ANGLE - DR. LOVELESS \nis half a man. Literally. Cut off at the waist and mounted on a wheelchair platform that is powered by an engine, he is a man bereft of tuchus, kishkes and everything else in that vicinity that makes life interesting. \n(CONTINUED) \n56   CONTINUED:    (2)                                               56 \nLOVELESS (chuckles) We may've lost the war, but heaven knows... we haven't lost our sense of humor! \nDr. Loveless looks down at himself, smoothes half of his Fritz Lang Metropolis-style suit. His face turns dark as he surveys the crowd. \nLOVELESS Not even when we've lost a lung... a spleen... a bladder... two legs... thirty-five feet of small intestine and our ability to reproduce... (like a preacher) All in the name of the South... (then quietly) ... do we lose our sense of humor. \nYou can hear a pin drop.    Loveless turns to the foreign dignitaries. \nLOVELESS I owe a deep debt of gratitude to my friends across the sea for their comfort and... succor. \nHe suddenly seems distracted by the comely beauties that surround him. Then abruptly, manically... \nLOVELESS So...! Mi casa es su casa! Ma maison est a vous! Let the party begin!!! \nLoveless signals to the quartets to resume playing. Miss East leans down and whispers in his ear. Loveless looks in West's direction. \nNow Loveless wheels over to West. West isn't hiding. He's cocky in the face of rolling danger. \nLOVELESS Mr. West, how nice of you to join us tonight... and add color to these monochromatic proceedings. \nWest keeps a lid on his temper.    Two can play at this game. \nWEST (still pissed, to Gordon) Hang'm!?! \nGORDON (to Rita) Meet my trigger-happy partner, James West... who doesn't seem to realize that my carefully planned diversion gave me the opportunity to search for the missing scientists. \nNow West notices the half-dressed bombshell in the carriage. \nWEST Scientist, huh. \nGORDON This is Rita. I found her locked in a cage in Loveless's bedroom. She's an entertainer. \nRITA Um, maybe I haven't been quite honest about that... My name is Rita Escobar. I came to find Guillermo Escobar, the scientist, my... father. \nGordon's eyes pop. \nGORDON Professor Escobar?! He was the one I almost rescued that night when... (lightbulb) That's where I know you from! Fat-Can Candy's... you sang before I did. \nRITA Excuse me? \n(CONTINUED) \nTHE WILD WILD WEST - Rev. 6/15/98                         50. \n68   CONTINUED:    (2)                                               68 \nGORDON That was me. Burgundy dress with the bustle... \nGordon starts singing the song... West rolls his eyes, cuts off the chit-chat. \nWEST Look, Rita, I'm sorry you had the wrong agent working on your case. When I find your father I promise I'll send him back safely... \nAnd with that... West suddenly leaps over Rita -- lands on the back of one of the horses. He grabs a handful of mane, leans over and unclips the harness. And with a kick in the ribs, West is off at a gallop -- leaving Gordon, one remaining horse and an awed Rita behind to chew his dust. \nRITA He's impulsive, James. \n69   EXT. OFFSHORE - LOVELESS BOAT - NIGHT                           69 \nDr. Loveless and his visiting foreign dignitaries are sipping champagne. One of them is holding a little DOG in his arms, BARKING at something in the dark. General McGrath stands at the railing, uncharacteristically pensive. Loveless rolls over, hands him a glass of champagne. \nLOVELESS Well, General, it's been a long journey from New Liberty. \nMcGrath visibly winces at the sound of it. \nMcGRATH Sir, there isn't a day that passes that I don't contemplate it. \nLOVELESS Yes, and so do I. So do I.

We recognize one of the REBS from the cathouse. He opens his pocket watch. \nREB #1 They oughta be here by now. \nREB #2 Maybe we're in the wrong place. \nREB #1 (rechecks map) No, we're supposed to wait 'xactly on this here spot. \nSuddenly they hear a CLANKING and SCREECHING coming from the marsh. They ready their arms and get in defensive positions. What they can't see through the fog is... \nANGLE - MARSH - ARMORED TANK \namphibiously sludges up through the mud and reeds, passing by the dumbstruck soldiers as it heads to the center of the field. The contraption has a large cannon and Gatling guns bristling from several ports. The Rebs cheer their new weapon. \nTHE WILD WILD WEST - Rev. 7/1/98                         52. \n71   EXT.

You've betrayed us! \nLoveless turns to him, cocks his head. \nLOVELESS My dear General, after donating half my physical being creating a weapon capable of doing this... how did you and General Lee repay my loyalty? You surrendered at Appomattox! So, who betrayed whom? \nLoveless turns to Munitia holding a steno pad. \nGORDON It came up out of the lake... from the way these corpses are positioned, laid down a 360-degree pattern of cannon fire... then disappeared in moments.

Or go do something! What would you do, Jim?! \nThat gets the man of action where he lives. \nWEST Look, I got nothing against you, Rita. It's just that...

I'm an actor. Or was. I gave it up. I went by the name of Arthur Gordon. Ever hear of me? \nWEST No. How did you wind up in this line of work? \nGORDON The pinnacle of my life in the theater came in a production of Our American Cousin -- a light comedy -- at Ford's Theater in Washington. There was this one line I had... always got the biggest laugh in the show. One night, it drowned out the gunshot that killed President Lincoln. (beat) I decided to devote my talents to making sure that never happened again. \nCLOSE - TARANTULA \nwalks slowly across West's outstretched hand. \nGORDON Uh... There's a spider on your hand. Doesn't that bother you? \nWEST She doesn't want any trouble. She's just trying to get warm. \nHe puts the spider down into the sand. \nGORDON How come you know so much about the desert, anyway? \nWEST The Indians taught me. I lived out here when I was a boy. \nGordon starts to ask West something but West doesn't want him to pry further. \n(CONTINUED) \nWILD WILD WEST - Rev. 09/03/98                            81/82. \n143   EXT.

There's a big spider stompin' towards our President! \nBut Gordon won't be hurried. He has a big book out, studies it, then looks back to his Nitro-cycle. \nGORDON I was just thinking about another spider. Remember in the desert, when that little wasp killed the tarantula...? \nWest rolls his eyes impatiently. \nWEST Yeah. Well, the wasp had a small advantage. It could fly. \nGORDON Exactly! \nGordon excitedly shows the book to West. Pictured is an archaic sepia diagram of a weird aircraft. West looks at it in disbelief as Gordon prattles on manically. \nGORDON In 1540, Leonardo Da Vinci invented a flying machine called the 'Ornithopter.' Though he never actually flew it... \nWest's heard enough.    He grabs Gordon, shakes him. \nWEST Artemus! There's no time for plans or half-cocked inventions! They don't work.

Amazonia drags Grant out of his seat and sticks a pen in his manacled hands. \nPRESIDENT GRANT Never will I sign that paper, never will the United States ever surrender! \nAn immediate standing ovation. The diversion allows Coleman to unlock both Grant's and Rita's shackles.

Even his 4th of July breasts aren't a match for them. Desperate, West reaches way down in his undergarments to retrieve one of Gordon's billiard balls.

Coleman, amazed at their torpor, quickly grabs a RIFLE from the incinerated goon and OPENS FIRE. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! \nThree goons drop. Gordon and West exchange looks. Not bad for an emphysemic old engineer. \nCOLEMAN Special Marshal... President thought you needed some lookin' after. \nSpeaking of the President... he's grabbed a dead goon's RIFLE, and is LAYING DOWN a pretty good field of FIRE himself. Suddenly, he gets a tap on the shoulder from behind. It's Amazonia. Whap, she sends a right to his chin knocking him out. She throws him over her shoulder and carries him away. \n179   INT.

TARANTULA - BELOW DECK - DUSK                              202A \nWest slowly gets up. Loveless is about to roll over him. He jumps up in the air, grabs onto an overhead strut, reverses and shoves the wheelchair off the ramp jamming the wheels. \nA smile comes to West's face as he watches Loveless's frustrated attempts at going forward and backward. \nWEST When you get right down to it, Loveless, you just can't beat a good pair of legs. \nLOVELESS (thin smile) You're obviously not a poker player, Mr. West... \nLoveless presses a button, the sound of MECHANICAL GEARS ENGAGING. Suddenly four metal legs appear from underneath the wheelchair, raising his body to a height of six foot ten. \nLOVELESS Two pair always beats a pair. \nWest stares up at him slack-jawed. Loveless rolls up his sleeves, steps away from the wheelchair ready to fight. \nLOVELESS Now... Was it someone particularly close to you who perished in that military action? \nWest responds with a roundhouse kick to the chin that makes Loveless spin around on the platform of his chair. \n(CONTINUED) \nWILD WILD WEST - Rev. 4/9/99                           110. \n202A   CONTINUED:                                                    202A \nLOVELESS (stunned) Hmmm.   Well, that hit a nerve. \nLoveless imitates West by kicking with a lightning flash of an alloy leg. It's a rib cracker that sends West sprawling. \nLOVELESS A mother, perhaps? A father? \nCLOSE - WEST'S HAND \nHe's just trying to get up when a cleated metal foot stomps down with hundreds of foot pounds per square inch. As West screams in pain... \nWILD WILD WEST - Rev. 4/9/99                            114. \n209   CONTINUED:                                                     209 \nWhimpering pathetically, he uncouples his body from the useless contraption and slowly backs up to his wheelchair that's stuck against the railing. \nLOVELESS Please, West... show a little mercy to a poor defenseless cripple... \nWEST (imitating his accent) Now, now, Doctor... let's not cloud this otherwise sunny day with that poor-ol'-me-cripple-talk. Just buck up and say to yourself, 'I am indefatigably hard-pumpin' and steely!' \nLoveless gets to his wheelchair and collapses in it. \nLOVELESS After I kill ya, I swear I'm gonna boil you down to axle grease! \nWEST Now that's the ol' doctor I know! \nBut the smile fades from West's face when he sees Loveless's shotgun armrests pop out leveled at his waist. \nWest has nowhere to go but up as he leaps to grab the I-beam over his head just as Loveless pulls the triggers on both BARRELS... BOOM! BOOM! \nThe SHOTS almost blow the heels off West's boots. They PUNCTURE a PIPE behind him. Steam spews out. This is going to have an effect on something. \n210   EXT.

TARANTULA - BELOW DECK - DUSK                             212 \nThe sudden stopping jerks Loveless' wheelchair free. Despite his frantic efforts, he's rolling toward the opposite railing. When the wheelchair hits a pool of hydraulic fluid on the deck, it spins him around 180 degrees. \nWest jumps up, grabs a girder. The wheelchair spins under West's legs and then -- CLANK -- it slams into the railing and wedges there. \n213   EXT. CLIFF EDGE - DUSK                                         213 \nThe impact makes the mighty beast jerk forward, inches away from toppling over. \n214   INT.

Thinking quickly, he grabs onto the back of Loveless' wheel- chair. His arms nearly torn from their sockets. His weight causes the wheelchair to shift, now leaving it hanging on by a thread. West reaches out, grabs the wheel of the chair and hangs there. \nLOVELESS Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle. How did we arrive in this dark situation? \nWEST I don't know.    Guess I'm stumped! \nLOVELESS And I'm so cotton-pickin' afraid of heights. They just give me the spooks! \nWEST Ah, don't be afraid, Loveless. With this being the last leg of our journey and all, you should soak in the view, you're really missing something. \nLOVELESS Mister West, I'm gonna cut this conversation short... \nWEST Good one, Loveless.

He goes to the balcony. \nWEST'S POV - OVER STAIR LANDING - DOWNSTAIRS \nThe scene below is hallucinogenically surreal. A Babel of foreign languages is the first thing that strikes us. Avant garde MUSIC is coming from two 10x10 quartet boxes on either side of the room to create stereo. \nSULTRY WOMAN (O.S.) An authentic cowboy outfit... complete with six-guns! \nWest turns to see who busted him.

West manages to position her nearly-naked rear end over the graphite powder. Very carefully, he stands, pushing her buttocks onto the desk and then rolling her off. The imprint on her left cheek is perfect. But unfortunately, it's backwards! \nCLOSE - WEST \nDamn. He lets Miss East concentrate on what she's doing, which from the SOUNDS O.S., doesn't appear to be a demonstration of the correct way to butter corn. \n(CONTINUED) \n62   CONTINUED:                                                     62 \nWest spies a mirror on the other side of the room and raises her ass up into position so he can see the corrected reflection. \nANGLE ON MIRROR - MAP \nCOMES INTO VIEW.

LOVELESS MANSION - STUDY - PAINTING - NIGHT               63 \nThe painting behind him has come to life. The Loveless in the painting swings a real shotgun around and is pointing it at the back of West's head. \nCLOSE - WEST \nsuddenly contorts his upper torso just as an EXPLOSION rips the back of the chair where his head would have been. \nHe draws and SHOOTS the would-be assassin, who falls out of the painting, dead.

He lowers her head gently to the ground, regards her map-imprinted rear end. \nWEST Thanks for helpin' me get to the bottom of this case. \n64   EXT.

(dip) Thought you should know that while you were trying to decide what shoes to wear tonight... (twirl) I found that our host, Dr. Loveless... \nWest looks over to where Loveless is leading a contingent of foreigners out a side exit. \nWEST ... is meeting McGrath and his troops at Malheureux Point in an hour. (bends her back) So you enjoy the party. I'm gonna go save the Republic. \nThe Soiled Dove look-alike is speechless.    Before he goes, West leans in, smirks. \nWEST But I will say, good work on your bladders tonight... they're damn perky. \nAnd just to dig the grave deeper, West lays hands on them and gives them a little squeeze. This immediately elicits a scream and a slap in the face that shocks the bejesus out of the black cowboy. And he's not the only one. \nANGLE ON CROWD \nstaring at him. We know what they're thinking, but the Mountain Man behind West says it for everyone. \nGORDON/MOUNTAIN MAN Hang him! \nAnd with that, Gordon opens his deerskin jacket to reveal his own rope, which he throws to the mob.

Is that the lesson? Well, I learned it. Don't scratch your head with the shrimp fork. I got that one too. So whaddaya say we call this off? \n66   INT.

Beside the bed, locked in an iron disco-like cage, is Rita, still wearing her scanty outfit. Gordon squints at her, gives a charming smile. \nGORDON I feel as if we know each other from someplace...? \nRITA Try again, buster...! \nShe takes a breath as if she's going to start screaming.

Not that I'm complaining, but what are you doin' in here? \nGORDON (looking up miles of leg) Looking for some missing scientists... not that I'm complaining. \nGordon unsnaps the sole of his shoe. It becomes a pedal that operates the wheels' rotation. Now he removes a bit and handle from his vest and attaches the cable. Starts to pump his foot. It's a foot-powered drill. \nGORDON I'm a special U.S. Marshal on assignment from the President. \nRITA (almost impressed) If you're so special, how come you're lookin' up here when Loveless has 'em all workin' down in the dungeon?

The 'dungeon' is cleaned out. It was the first place I checked, right after I sampled the gumbo. Bit heavy on the okra. \nBut Rita isn't listening to the food review. Her mind's racing. Finally, the LOCK CLICKS and the cage door swings open. Gordon takes the distressed damsel in his arms, lifts her out. \nRITA (suddenly a coquettish smile) Thank you... Artemus, was it? \nGORDON One doesn't forget a smile like that. Now where in the world was it...? Have you ever played the Empire Room... the Bijou Cafe perhaps...? \n67   EXT. LOVELESS MANSION - COURTYARD - NIGHT (SAME TIME)         67 \nWest is lifted onto the back of a wagon. With the noose dangling in front of his nose, West addresses the crowd. \nWEST Can I have everyone's attention please. I think we've had a series of major misunderstandings and I'd like to take a moment to clear them up. First, the whole drumming on the boobies thing. In my native land, Africa, my ancestors used drums to communicate between villages. I'm sure y'all can see that this young girl here can communicate all the way down to Baton Rouge. Hell, on a clear day, we might even get Galveston. All I was saying was, 'How're you doing,' 'My name's Jim,' 'How's your mama?'

That redneck comment. I'm getting the sense that some of you took that negatively. You know, some of my best friends are whiskey-guzzling, pot-bellied rednecks just like y'all here. (then) That slavery thing, I don't see what the big deal was. Hell, who wouldn't want somebody to run around for them doing chores. Are you going to get your big, fat, lazy ass out of bed every morning and pick your own damn cotton. I don't think so. (then) Let's head on inside and knock back some shine. Come on, back inside. No. Okay. (to Soiled Dove) I stand before you as a man who realizes he has done something wrong and I am prepared to do the right thing. Will you marry me? \nSoiled Dove gasps. \nWEST I'll take that as a no. Darling, would it help at all if I said I thought you were a man? \nThe CAMERA FINDS the Soiled Dove.

Gordon leads her into the stateroom to lock her in, but she grabs his hand. \nRITA Please, Artemus, don't leave me alone! \nRita closes the door behind him and locks it. \n117   INT. WANDERER - PARLOR CAR - STATEROOM - DAY                   117 \nGordon and Rita on the bed. FOOTSTEPS APPROACH. Gordon gestures to be still. The door handle jiggles. Rita gets ready to arm the POOL BALL. \n(CONTINUED) \n117   CONTINUED:                                                        117 \nWEST (O.S.) (hoarsely, not sounding like him) It's me, Jim. Open up! \nRITA It's a trick, I know Loveless. \nCLICK, she pushes the number.     Gordon makes a grab for it. \nGORDON Rita, no!   It's just... \nCLUNK... she drops it to the floor. \nANGLE - WEST \nstanding in the doorway. He rubs a raw welt on his neck from the garrote, smirks when he sees Gordon on the bed with Rita. But his smirk drops when he sees the pool ball roll between his feet -- spewing a purple cloud of sleeping gas. \nWest gives Gordon a Wile E. Coyote look, croaks... \nWEST Too damn late, is what it is. \n118   EXT. CORNFIELD - DAY                                              118 \nA sea of corn tassels waving in the wind. Loveless's destroyed train is in the b.g. The CAMERA TILTS DOWN to find... \nANGLE ON WEST AND GORDON \nlying on the ground with their BACKS TO us. They stir. West props himself up, looks over at Gordon, who has just regained consciousness. \n", "test3_true": "West shakes his head disparagingly and stands. He feels the metal band around his neck and surveys the 18-inch wire fence which has been laid around them in a circle. West is about to step over it. Gordon grabs his leg. \n(CONTINUED) \n118   CONTINUED:                                                     118 \nGORDON Don't move! \n119   EXT. WANDERER - BACK PLATFORM - DAY                            119 \nLoveless is sitting in his wheelchair, fifty yards from West and Gordon. On Loveless's elbow sits Miss Lippenreider. She looks through binoculars and lip reads West and Gordon. \nLOVELESS Continue, Miss Lippenreider... \nMISS LIPPENREIDER (doing both voices in a monotone) West. Let go of my leg! Gordon. Listen to me. Loveless collared us with the same metal device we found on Morton. \nLoveless turns to Munitia, who is loading two 36-inch- diameter metal discs into what looks like a CD changer/clay-pigeon-thrower. \nLOVELESS Oh, Munitia... I hope we're not going to leave evidence behind like we did last time. \nMUNITIA Nitro this time, sire. \nAs she arms the device, and a red light comes on... \nLOVELESS (through megaphone) Good morning, gentlemen! I trust you slept well. \n120   EXT. CORNFIELD - PERIMETER - DAY                               120 \nWest and Gordon squint through the corn, see Loveless on their train. \nGORDON What have you done with Rita? \n(CONTINUED) \n120   CONTINUED:                                                      120 \nLOVELESS Rita, is it? How familiar! Rita is sleeping off the after-effects in the stateroom. (looks toward bedroom) Quite lovely, isn't she? Who knows... I might even become 'familiar' with her myself. \nGordon takes a step.    West stops him. \nWEST And that would become one more reason why I'm going to kill you. \nLOVELESS Yes, Mr. West, I'm sure a well- endowed blackamoor like yourself must find it absolutely impossible... that a freak like me could fully enjoy the pleasure of a woman. But having witnessed my use of mechinology so far... wouldn't you think I could provide myself with something for the lower half of my body that was hard-pumping and indefatigably steely? \nLoveless looks O.S. \nLOVELESS ... And speaking of 'hard pumping...' Mr. Coleman, full steam ahead! \n121   EXT. WANDERER - ENGINE ROOM - COLEMAN - DAY                     121 \nIn the engine room.    Amazonia has a gun to his head. \n122   EXT. WANDERER (STARTING TO MOVE) - DAY                          122 \nLoveless takes his last shot at them from the back. \nLOVELESS What a marvelous train! You don't mind if I borrow it, do you, gentlemen? (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n122   CONTINUED:                                                     122 \nLOVELESS (CONT'D) Other than a lack of wheelchair access, I find it a most comfortable way to pass the long miles from here to my laboratory in Spider Canyon... (louder, as they move off) I'll be seeing President Grant soon at Promontory Point. What shall I tell him for you? I'm afraid it can't be that you're alive and well... \nAnd as his maniacal giggle hangs in the air... \n123   EXT. CORNFIELD - PERIMETER - GORDON AND WEST - DAY             123 \nfrustrated, as the train pulls away from them.    West tugs at the metal collar around his neck. \nWEST Gordon, get out your little tool kit and get this damn thing off of me! \nGordon unbuttons his shirt to reveal his leather tool kit... empty except for a note. Gordon opens it and reads. \nGORDON 'Gentlemen, welcome to the Loveless Experimental Camp for Political Dissidents. There are no guards. No barbed wire. As long as you stay within the designated perimeter, you will stay alive.' \n124   EXT. CORNFIELD - WANDERER - MOVING - BACK PLATFORM - DAY       124 \nMiss Lippenreider is still eavesdropping for Loveless, through binos. \nMISS LIPPENREIDER West. How do you know it's not just bullshit? Gordon. Step over the fence and find out. Rita and I will put flowers on your grave every year. \n125   EXT. CORNFIELD - PERIMETER - WEST - DAY                        125 \nstands next to the little fence, watching Loveless escape. \nWEST I don't have time for this. \nGORDON Wait, I have an auxiliary tool kit! \nGordon peels back the top of his boot revealing it. But it's too late. West has jumped over the fence. Then he hops back inside it. He holds his hands out to Gordon. \nWEST See?     Nothing happened. \nWest grabs Gordon by the back of his vest and yanks him over the fence. Now they hear a slight BUZZING in the air and it's not a bee. \nNEW ANGLE - DISC \ncomes whipping over the corn straight for West's head. In a split second, he ducks and the disc cuts the tops of the corn off and banks around for a new attack. \nGORDON Oh, really...? \nNow both of them step over the fenced perimeter and start running like hell through the cornfield. \n", "test3_id": 1877}

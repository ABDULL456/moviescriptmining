JERRY DIFUSCO (CONT'D) Call 911. 
Lex Lethal and some of the other wrestlers climb into the ring. They huddle around Randy. 
JERRY DIFUSCO (CONT'D) Let's get him up. 
With no small effort, they lift Randy. They carry him to the ropes. They slow, unsure how best to get him through. 
LEX LETHAL Put him down. 
They lower him to the mat. Lex hops out of the ring and grabs Randy's ankles. 
Several of the other guys hop out of the ring, supporting Randy's underside as they carefully, awkwardly pull him out. 
By now, the crowd realizes this is real. They surge forward as DiFusco and the wrestlers carry Randy toward the exit. 
JERRY DIFUSCO Get back, get back, get back. 
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
Randy is carried down a LONG HALLWAY, trailed by curious and concerned fans. Lex is closest to Randy's head. 
LEX LETHAL You're okay, buddy. Hang on. 
They reach a door and enter. The wrestler holding Randy's feet shuts it behind them. 
INT. LOCKER ROOM/STAGING AREA - SHORT TIME LATER 
Randy lies on a table, his eyes rolling back in his head. Lex squeezes his hand, trying to keep him conscious. 
LEX LETHAL Stay with us, bro. Help's coming. 
EMS WORKERS come rushing in. 
FADE TO BLACK. 
INT. SUFFOLK COUNTY HOSPITAL - POST-OP RECOVERY ROOM - NIGHT 
Randy lies unconscious. There's a BREATHING TUBE in his mouth and ANOTHER TUBE going through his CHEST WALL. He's hooked up to a MECHANICAL VENTILATOR. 
FADE TO BLACK. 
INT. POST-OP RECOVERY ROOM - NEXT DAY 
Randy lies asleep. The breathing tube is out. The chest tube is still in. 
His eyes slowly open. He looks around, disoriented. Woozy. Confused by all the wires on him, he starts PULLING THINGS OFF. Monitors BEEP. Nurses rush into the room, calming him down as they try to reattach the wires. 
He faints. 
INT. RANDY'S ROOM - NEXT DAY 
Randy, transferred to a regular hospital room, is watching "All My Children" on the wall-mounted TV. The chest tube is out, in its place a large bandage. 
MAN'S VOICE (O.S.) (slight Indian accent) Mr. Ramovic. 
Randy looks up. DR. TARACHANDANI (40) enters the room. 
RANDY Call me Randy. 
The doctor, nodding, looks down Randy's folder. 
RANDY (CONT'D) So how we lookin', doc? 
DR. TARACHANDANI A lot better than before the bypass. 
RANDY Great. So I'm all good. 
From the doctor's face, it's not quite that simple. 
DR. TARACHANDANI Your heart... You're going to have to start taking much better care of it. 
RANDY Like... 
DR. TARACHANDANI For starters, you must take your medication every day. 
RANDY I could handle that. 
DR. TARACHANDANI No smoking. (Randy nods) And no cocaine. 
RANDY (defensive, offended) I don't do coke. 
DR. TARACHANDANI It's all over your blood work. 
RANDY (sheepish, busted) Maybe once in a while. 
DR. TARACHANDANI Well, it has to be never. 
Randy gives him a reluctant nod. 
DR. TARACHANDANI (CONT'D) As for exercise, it's still okay, as long as it's moderate. 
RANDY So, like, wrestling... 
DR. TARACHANDANI Not a good idea.

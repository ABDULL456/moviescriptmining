KRISTI ... and suddenly there's a guy right behind you and `wait a minute, why is he wearing a HOCKEY 
MASK!' They all laugh. 
ARON Let me guess... You're here for the paintings or the Cathedral? 
KRISTI The Cathedral? We've got a bit disorientated and the map isn't great. Where is it? 
ARON The climb's a little tricky but it's worth it. 
KRISTI / MEGAN We climb. 
They all laugh. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CAVE. APPARENTLY SMOOTH DOME. DAY 
Towards us comes Aron, upside down, like a tiny, fast spider, talking all the time, his voice echoing. 
ARON There's thousands of holds but you can't see them until you're almost upside down and then they just keep appearing... it's a bit of a act of faith so I'll go first... take off as much as you dare as there's a bit of a surprise at the other end... 
MEGAN (O.S.) You behave Aron Ralston or we'll tell your mother all about where you lure girls... 
ARON I swear I won't look but I swear you won't care when you get out here... 
We've been moving towards him as he rushes towards us, spider style. He's stripped to his underwear. He's lithe to say the least. We can't see the girls or what's underneath us but there's a feeling of the vertiginous, as much from the weird echo and the sense of reflected light as from the scale of the dome. 
ARON (CONT'D) ... and the thing is, when you get to the middle... He lets go. 
ARON (CONT'D) ... there aren't any more. We spin and watch him fall into the most exquisite emerald pool 60 feet below. 
KRISTI 
OMG! 
CUT TO: 
INT. CAVE. DAY. 
They can't see him. They can only hear the explosive crack of man on water. 
MEGAN Are you ok? ARON! 
KRISTI Of course he's ok. Listen to him. Aron fills the cathedral dome with his version of a Phish song at the top of his voice. Kristi strips to her underwear and traverses away from Megan. 
KRISTI (CONT'D) Got to be there, Meg. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CAVE. DAY. 
From the pool below with Aron we see Kristi in her underwear heading out arachnid-style to the centre. Before she gets there Megan appears too. She's left everything on except her shoes. 
They crash into the pool one after the other. They bob together in the centre, the light seems to come from beneath them and ripple over the heavenly ceiling.

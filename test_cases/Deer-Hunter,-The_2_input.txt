SAL All set, hon? 
ANGELA nods. SAL puts the car into gear and starts slowly off. Fists pound on the car. Rice and streamers shower down. Suddenly, through the front windshield, MERLE appears, stark naked, running in front of the car with colored paper streamers floating out from his upraised right hand. For a split second SAL cannot believe what he is seeing. He throws a look at ANGELA. ANGELA covers her mouth in amazement and then quickly shifts the hand to cover her eyes. 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
MERLE weaves down the street in front of the growling red Pontiac. MERLE is not just running. He is leaping and bounding, as if released from gravity and entered into a realm of pure ethereal space. 
NICK, ALBERT, VINCE and JOHN pound down the street behind the Pontiac, ALBERT carrying MERLE's clothes. 
GUYS Look at that! Fuckin' guy! Fuckin' Merle!... Unbelievable! 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
The road forks, one road going high to a parking area, the other descending to the valley below. MERLE swerves up the incline toward the parking area, while the Pontiac goes straight and disappears down the hill. 
ALBERT, VINCE and JOHN stagger to a stop, panting helplessly. NICK grabs MERLE's clothes from ALBERT and takes off up the hill. 
EXT. HILLSIDE PARKING AREA - NIGHT 
MERLE stands motionless, looking out across the valley as NICK approaches. The night is brilliantly clear and the fires from the mill light up the sky with an eerie glow. 
NICK comes to a stop a few feet away. 
NICK Merle? 
MERLE turns. His face has a strange, distant look, and he gives NICK an almost feral grin. 
MERLE You think we'll ever come back? 
NICK (startled) From Nam? 
MERLE Yeah. 
NICK moves up beside him. He doesn't know what to say. 
MERLE (CONT'D) I love this fuckin' place... That sounds crazy. I know that sounds crazy, but I love this fuckin' place... If anything happens, Nick, don't leave me there. I mean it. Don't leave me... You gotta promise, Nick. You gotta promise me that. 
NICK (half laughing) Merle -- 
MERLE Promise! You gotta promise! 
NICK You got it. 
MERLE lets out his breath. It is as if some great weight had been pressing on him. 
MERLE (with a laugh) Let's go huntin'. I mean let's do it! 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. THRUWAY - NIGHT 
NICK'S battered old shark-finned Cadillac comes screaming past. 
INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT 
NICK, MERLE, VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN, all of them still in tuxedos, are jammed in the car between knapsacks, sleeping bags, six packs of beer and deer rifles. 
GUYS (singing) Let me be free! Let me be free! If... you... will let me be free... You'll... always be happy... with me-e-e-e!!! 
ALBERT (making a trumpet sound) Wa-wa-wa!... Waaaaa!!! 
EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT 
Tale Cadillac comes blasting by... 
INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT 
NICK is hunched over the wheel, his eyes gone completely glassy. MERLE and VINCE are on the nod, while ALBERT and JOHN, both half asleep, are having a lead-voiced conversation. 
ALBERT She fucked you? 
JOHN She fucked me. 
ALBERT She fucked me too. 
JOHN She fucked you? 
ALBERT She fucked me too. 
There is a long pause. They both struggle to keep their eyes open. 
JOHN She fucked us both.

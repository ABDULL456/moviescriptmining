VOICE Yes, sir. 
The voice is young, and not too assertive. Ramirez consults his watch and looks out the window again. Everything still seems to be normal. 
VOICE Sir...? 
Ramirez carefully opens the door. In walks a young, rather innocent-looking WAITER with a jar of ice water. He wears a fez on his head. As he places it on a table, Ramirez eyes him with suspicion. Suddenly the waiter reaches underneath his jacket and... pulls out a small handgun. 
ON RAMIREZ 
He is frozen with fear. 
ON WAITER 
Putting his finger to his mouth to signal silence, he shoves the gun and silencer under a napkin. Then he takes off his fez and from within, pulls out a small grenade and extra clip of ammunition. Without any further attempt at communication, he exits the room. 
RAMIREZ Jesus. 
Ramirez walks back into the bathroom. He splashes water on his face and takes three deep breaths and then slowly looks up into the mirror... and finds Carlos. 
EXT. STREET IN LIBYA - DOWNTOWN TRIPOLI - DAY 
We SEE a beautiful dark haired woman of about thirty coming down the street. There are several other pedestrians as well. The woman is Agnieska. She carries a large bag of groceries. 
EXT. STREET - TRIPOLI, LIBYA - RESIDENTIAL AREA - DAY 
A van is parked on the street. Agnieska walks along. The van starts. A man whom we will come to know as VLADIMIR adjusts the mirror. His partner NIKOLAI readjusts it and in it we SEE Agnieska, walking. The two KGB operatives, now both see Agnieska. 
VLADIMIR [There she comes...] 
NIKOLAI [Do you see Misha?] 
VLADIMIR [Not yet.] 
Behind Agnieska about fifty feet behind her we SEE several pedestrians, one is an Arab and another a European. Agnieska goes up into an apartment building. 
VLADIMIR [There he is.] 
Around the corner comes another Arab businessman type. The first Arab stops in front of the apartment house and bends down to tie his shoe. The second Arab comes up alongside of him and the first Arab gives an almost imperceptible nod. The second Arab goes into the apartment house. 
VLADIMIR [He's passing her to Leonid. For Russians, they make good Arabs.] 
The van makes a U-turn and pulls around the corner to give them another vantage point of Agnieska's apartment. 
INT. VAN - LIBYA - DAY 
The two Russian operatives continue their stakeout of Agnieska's apartment. 
INT. APARTMENT - LIBYA - LATE AFTERNOON 
Agnieska enters the apartment. She opens the door and slowly walks in. The apartment is dark. She is about to turn on the lights when suddenly a hand grabs her from behind around her mouth and another hand holding a gun snaps right down next to her head. She drops the groceries and screams but the hand muffles it. She struggles a bit but the person who holds her hisses. 
PERSON HOLDING HER (in an Arabic accent) SHHHHHHH. One sound and you're dead. 
Outside the door we hear faintly the sound of footsteps. We still cannot make out who is holding her. He appears to be an Arab in traditional garb completely bald with mustache and glasses. He speaks in a thick Arabic accent. 
PERSON HOLDING HER Carlos... when is he coming here? 
He loosens the grasp on her mouth. 
AGNIESKA I don't know what you're talking about. 
PERSON HOLDING HER Don't play games with me. We've had you followed. We know you're going to meet him. Now, when?! 
AGNIESKA I don't know any Carlos... please I'm telling you the truth. 
The person holding her still has his gun at her head. He cocks the trigger back with a loud noise. The gun has a silencer on it. 
PERSON HOLDING HER This gun has a silencer. There won't be any noise. Now talk! 
AGNIESKA I don't know what you're talking about... I'm not from here. I just came to visit a girlfriend. This is her apartment. She'll be here tomorrow... please. 
The person who is holding her throws her to the floor. He stands over her. 
PERSON HOLDING HER You're lying... 
AGNIESKA I swear to you... I'm telling the truth... 
The bald Arab who was holding her slowly takes his belt out of its loops and puts his gun back in his pants. He holds the belt as if he is going to strangle her. 
AGNIESKA What... what are you going to do to me. 
PERSON WHO WAS HOLDING HER First... I'm going to have some fun with you... and then...

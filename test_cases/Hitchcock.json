{"train": "HITCHCOCK \nWritten by \nJohn J. McLaughlin \nBased on the book Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho by \nStephen Rebello \nFADE IN: \nEXT. MARSHLAND - DUSK \nWe move across smoldering embers and reach a small grass fire. Dirt is thrown over the flames before a BOOT finishes stamping them out. \nSUPER: PLAINFIELD, WISCONSIN, 1944 \nHENRY GEIN (O.S.) We're just lucky it didn't reach the trees... \nWe move up two dirty pairs of overalls to find HENRY and ED GEIN sweating away as they continue shovelling out the flames. Both are in their forties and wearing flannel shirts. Ed wears an Elmer Fudd hat. \nHENRY GEIN (CONT'D) There's gonna be a lot more jobs at that factory by Milwaukee come June. I could put in a word. \nED GEIN You can't leave us, Henry. She needs both OF US-- \nHENRY GEIN Can you stop being a momma's boy for one second? \nHenry looks at Ed and he shrinks back. \nHENRY GEIN (CONT'D) I'm not trying to hurt you but Jesus you got to live your own life someday. That woman can take care of her own goddamn -- \nCLANG. Henry is hit by the shovel in the back of the head and goes down. \nEd steps slowly forward and puts down the shovel. The look on his face isn't anger. It's BLANK. He pulls at the flaps of his Elmer Fudd hat... then calmly walks away. \nThe camera pans until we discover : \nALFRED HITCHCOCK \nin his trademark black Mariani suit. He's been watching the whole thing, standing in the smouldering field only a few feet away, holding a rose-patterned cup and saucer of tea... \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nHe takes a sip and turns to address the camera -- \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Good evening. \nHe places his cup daintily back on the saucer. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Brother has been slaying brother since Cain and Abel, yet even I did not see that coming. I was as blind-sided as poor Henry over there. \nHe glances back over at the murder scene. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Apparently the authorities shared my naivete and believed the young man's tale that Henry fell and hit his head on a stone and died of smoke asphyxiation. \nHe shrugs: `Who would've thought it?' \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Of course if they hadn't believed him, Ed never would have had the opportunity to commit the heinous acts for which he became famous... and we wouldn't have our little movie. Instead, we'd have more nice, safe, predictable ones like these... \nCUT TO: \nA RAPID MONTAGE OF CLIPS \nfrom various Technicolor Films of the era: Peyton Place, with Lana Turner and Betty Field. Pillow Talk with Doris Day and Rock Hudson. A Summer Place with Sandra Dee -- \nEXT. MARSHLAND - AS BEFORE \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Mere Technicolor baubles. \nHe shudders with distaste. As if on cue the sky THUNDERS LOUDLY above him. He looks up and from behind the tree stump produces an umbrella. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Ah. A bit of doom and gloom. Now, that's more like it. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nAs Hitch opens his brolly and the RAIN starts to bucket down WE -- \nCUT TO : \nEXT. MARQUEE OF UNITED ARTISTS THEATER, CHICAGO - NIGHT \nEqually torrential rain lit up by rotating KLEIG LIGHTS as they scan a MARQUEE: \"WORLD PREMIERE! NORTH BY NORTHWEST. DIRECTED BY ALFRED HITCHCOCK.\" JOSTLING CROWDS run the length of the block. \nSUPER: JULY 8, 1959. \nALMA Right between the shoulder blades. I learned it from your pictures. \nShe moves off to the mirror to apply lipstick and Hitchcock surreptitiously picks up the papers again... \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Where are you off to? \nALMA I'm seeing Whit for brunch after I drop you off at the studio. Why don't you join us? \nALFRED HITCHCOCK We've just established that I'm too corpulent to be seen in broad daylight. \nALMA You'll feel better as soon as you find a project. Hasn't Peggy unearthed any decent books yet? \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Sleeping pills with dust jackets. \nAlma steps back to inspect herself in the full-length mirror. Today's outfit is, we sense, rather more stylish than what she would ordinarily wear. \nALMA Well? \nHitch's gaze never leaves the photo gallery of his younger rivals in the `New Masters of Suspense' article... \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Very presentable. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) \nON ALMA \nAs she elegantly masks her hurt. \nALMA Hurry up, darling. You're pruning. \nShe leaves. Hitch grumbles and tosses his paper aside. He rises from the depths but suddenly loses his balance and grabs onto the SHOWER CURTAIN, wrenching it from the METAL RINGS on the rod. \nA GOD'S EYE view, looking down, as Hitchcock stares up at the metal rings SPINNING NOISILY on the metal rod. \nEXT. THE PARAMOUNT STUDIOS, BRONSON GATE - DAY \nThe FAMOUS MOUNTAIN TOP icon looms large. TWO GUARDS snap-to for the arrival of Hollywood royalty. \nFIRST GUARD Mr. Hitchcock. Mrs. Hitchcock. \nAlma waves from the wheel of a GLEAMING BLACK 1957 CADILLAC. Hitchcock sits next to her. He has his two SEALYHAM TERRIERS on his lap. He nods, awaiting more. \nFIRST GUARD (CONT'D) (to the dogs) Sirs. \nEXT. PARAMOUNT STUDIOS, PRODUCERS' BUILDING - DAY \nThe Cadillac pulls up. Alma notes Hitchcock's look of frustrated envy as CREW MEMBERS bustle in and out of STAGE 15. It's a hive of activity. \nALMA There's a story out there waiting for you somewhere, Hitch. I promise. \nHe gives her a good-bye peck and opens the door. \nALMA (CONT'D) Don't forget your lunch. \nAlma hands him a compact Fortnum & Mason basket and pats him on his girth. He opens it to discover CELERY AND CARROT STICKS wrapped in Saran. \nOMITTED INT. HITCHCOCK'S OFFICE, PARAMOUNT - DAY \nLuxurious, wood-paneled and very British. Hitch sits restlessly behind his desk, receiving his morning shave from his private barber, SILVIO. His longtime assistant, PEGGY ROBERTSON, 40s, crisp, British, fiercely protective of her boss, is going through a list of potential projects. \nPEGGY Fox is offering you The Diary of Anne Frank for the third time. \nHitch directs his response to Silvio. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK The audience would spend the entire picture waiting for Miss Frank to discover the corpse I'd hidden in the attic. Wouldn't you agree, Silvio? \nSILVIO Si. \nHitch reaches for a carrot stick and CRUNCHES it. \nPEGGY MGM wants you for the Ian Fleming book, Casino Royale, with Cary Grant. Definitely your style. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (again, turning to Silvio) Doesn't she know I just made that movie? It's called North by Northwest. And \"style\" is merely self-plagiarism. \nSilvio nods, then recommences the shave. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) I'm treading water, Peggy. I need something fresh. Something different. Without expensive stars like Cary Grant or Miss Kim Novak to pretty it up. \nSilvio unintentionally nicks Hitch's face. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) A nice, clean, nasty little piece of work. \nSilvio hurriedly dabs away a speck of BLOOD. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nHe drains it playfully. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Gin. Mother's ruin. \nBut something's caught his eye. A circled review of Anthony Boucher's column \"CRIMINAL MINDS\" in the New York Times Review of Books. He picks it up. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Boucher says this \"Psycho\" book by Robert Bloch is `fiendishly entertaining'. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nPEGGY It sounds ghastly. Everyone in town's already passed. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK And who is everyone? \nPEGGY The story department finished the coverage this morning. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Is this the one based on Ed Gein, the serial killer? \nHe takes the coverage and reads for himself. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) \"Graphic elements of brutal violence, voyeurism, transvestitism and incest.\" Certainly not your average run of the mill nutcase, is he? \nHe gives a grunt of approval. \nPEGGY You're kidding. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Peggy. This is the boy who dug up his own mother. \nINT. HITCHCOCK'S STUDY - THE NEXT NIGHT \nON HITCH \nCompletely engrossed as he sits reading \"Psycho\" in a chair by the fire of his elegant Bel Air home. He takes another gulp of wine when he hears Alma enter and slides the wine glass out of view. Alma pops her head in the door. \nALMA Hungry? \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Famished. \nShe disappears to take off her coat. \nALMA (O.S.) If you're good, maybe you can have a grapefruit later. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nShe comes back in again carrying some galleys, notices the title of Hitch's book -- some trash called \"Psycho.\" \nALMA (CONT'D) Whit gave me the galleys of his new book yesterday at lunch. I've already got some ideas on how you could adapt it. \nHitch continues reading. \nALMA (CONT'D) It's elegant, sophisticated, full of INTRIGUE -- \nALFRED HITCHCOCK The book or Mr. Whitfield Cook? \nShe taps Hitch's book dismissively with the galleys of \"Taxi to Dubrovnik.\" \nALMA This might be the one, Alfred. \nHe finally looks up. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Leave it on the night stand. \nAs she leaves she points to Hitch's `hidden' wine glass. \nALMA There are calories in that, you know. \nBut Hitch ignores her and turns to look out the window, his imagination starting to turn... \nINT. GEIN HOUSE, PLAINVIEW, 1945 - NIGHT \nEd enters the bedroom. His mother, Augusta, is in the bed, faced away from him. \nED GEIN Aren't you cold, ma? \nShe doesn't answer. We follow him to the dresser where he lingers a little too long over his mother's open underwear drawer before grabbing the blue coverlet on the side. \nHe comes over and spreads the extra blanket over her. Still wearing his jacket, he takes off his shoes, gets into bed and crawls up next to her. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nED GEIN (CONT'D) Don't be afraid, ma... I'm here... \nAs he puts his arm around her and pulls her close, we reveal his mother's ghoulishly embalmed face. \nINT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, BEDROOM - NIGHT \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (PRE-LAP) (CONT'D) ..they opened the door only to discover - voila... \nHe produces the manila envelope from behind his back and empties THE HORRIFICALLY GORY CRIME SCENE PHOTOGRAPHS inside onto the coffee table. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) ... Ten female heads with the tops sawn off, a dozen masks of human skin, and a pair of lips on a drawstring for a window shade. \nHitch looks down sweetly at the circle of quietly horrified expressions... \nHEDDA HOPPER TYPE Is this really going to be you're next picture, Mr. Hitchcock? \nHITCHCOCK That is my intention, madam. Yes. \nHitch taps the photo of ED GEIN. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK I only wish he looked more like William Holden and less like Elmer Fudd. \nThe other columnists scribble down the quote. \nHEDDA HOPPER TYPE Am I the only one who finds this offensive? \nALFRED HITCHCOCK I was hoping everyone would. I mean life is deeply offensive and disgusting, isn't it? \nHitch glides off without missing a beat, past the Servers arriving with more hors d'oeuvres from the kitchen. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Try the finger sandwiches -- they're real fingers. \nHe snags a martini and collars Peggy while he's at it. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Peggy. I'm going to need some research detailing a typical unmarried 30-year-old secretary from Phoenix, Arizona. \nHe looks over at the pantry, where Alma can be glimpsed through the swinging door, putting food onto trays. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Her monthly rent, what she wears, what she reads, which scent or perfume she prefers... \nHitch sees WHIT lean into view and innocently whisper something into Alma's ear making her laugh. \nPEGGY ... How she deals with a demanding boss when she's trying to relax on her weekends off? \nHitchcock doesn't notice the joke. He now only has eyes on the pantry ahead. \nHe forges on through the guests only to get waylaid by Lew. It is a classic Hitchcock moment, a character needing to get someplace being held up by someone who wants to chat -- \nLEW WASSERMAN (re: the faces of the GOSSIP COLUMNISTS) I told you, Hitch. This thing's strictly for the drive-in crowd. \nHitch smiles tightly and extricates himself, heading on to the kitchen through more annoying guests -- \nINT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, PANTRY - SIMULTANEOUS \nWhit leans against the stove watching Alma expertly arrange the next round of hors d'oeuvres coming in from the kitchen. \nWHITFIELD COOK Now, if this were a Hitchcock picture what would two characters like us, married to other people, be saying? \nALMA You don't have to pretend you're not upset he hasn't read it yet, you know. \nWHITFIELD COOK I'm a big boy. I can take it. \nALMA Well, I loved it. What terrific fun it must have been to research. \nWHITFIELD COOK Certainly more fun than reading those reviews. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nWHITFIELD COOK (CONT'D) (THEN) Do you think he really will read it? \nSuddenly, over Whitfield's shoulder, Alma sees Hitch looming in the doorway. Whit notes the tiny change in her eyes and turns. \nWHITFIELD COOK (CONT'D) Speak of the devil. \nHitch stares blankly at him while Alma turns and busies herself over the sink, hiding an almost imperceptible blush. \nWHITFIELD COOK (CONT'D) I have to admit, Hitch, I ran all over town looking for a copy of \"Psycho\" but couldn't find a single one. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK I wonder how that could have happened. \nHitch sips his martini, a picture of innocence. Then leans in to Whit's ear and whispers - just like Whit leaned into Alma's ear a moment earlier. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Don't stop looking on my behalf. \nPeggy appears in the pass-through, beckoning Hitch to hurry back into the living room. \nINT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nALMA You're back early. \nHe shrugs, then sits at the table to pour himself a glass of lemonade. Alma gets out and towels herself off. \nALMA (CONT'D) I'm disappointed you didn't give Whit's book a chance. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK What about him? \nALMA He knows you well enough. \nShe sits down next to him, noticing a tiny hole in her swimsuit. It's starting to look a little threadbare. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Enjoy the pool now. We might not have it for that much longer. \nHe looks off cryptically. \nALMA Why? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Paramount refuses to finance the movie. Imagine -- The studio that brought you Martin and Lewis and The Greatest Show On Earth considers Psycho distasteful. \nHe brushes some fallen leaves off his chair. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Lew can't find the money. Not quickly enough at least. \nALMA Why not wait? \nHe doesn't reply. She knows him well enough too and doesn't question him further. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK We're going to have to go it alone, old girl. (BEAT) We'll finance the movie ourselves. \nALMA Are we going to have to sell the entire house or just the pool? \nShe looks at Hitch but he's not joking. She turns to survey their beloved home and gardens. \nA long pause. \nALMA (CONT'D) Tell me and I won't ever ask again. Why this one, Hitch? It's not just because so many people are telling you 'no,' is it? \nPause. \nALMA (CONT'D) Hitch? \nWithout turning he takes her hand. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Remember the fun we had when we started out and there was so little money and time? We took risks, we experimented. We invented new ways of making pictures because we had to. \nA long moment as he gazes across the pool. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) I want to feel that kind of freedom again. \nHe turns to look into her eyes for the first time. A glimpse of the real Hitchcock. Someone even his wife doesn't see that often... \nEXT. PARAMOUNT STUDIOS - DAY \nThe famous gates and the executive building beyond it. \nLEW WASSERMAN (PRE-LAP) Barney, we're about to propose a restructured deal for \"Psycho\"... \nINT. BALABAN'S PRIVATE OFFICE, PARAMOUNT - DAY \nBalaban watches Hitchcock and Lew closely. Hitchcock again is like a waxworks Buddha, revealing nothing. \nLEW WASSERMAN We finance it. Independently. Paramount only distributes it...in exchange for 40 percent of the profits. \nBARNEY BALABAN Interesting. But tell us, what exactly is Paramount distributing? Is this still a picture about a queer killing people in his mother's dress? \nLEW WASSERMAN What this picture is about is the reputation of Alfred Hitchcock. \nBARNEY BALABAN No-one's arguing that. \nLEW WASSERMAN Barney, it's very simple. This is Mr. Hitchcock's next film. Are you in or are you out? \nA long silence. \nBARNEY BALABAN Well, obviously you have a lot of passion for this project. Let me talk it over with a few people internally and I'll get back to you. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nLEW WASSERMAN No. Now. \nBalaban takes in their inscrutable stares. Not unimpressed by their chutzpah, he leans back and puts his hands behind his head, a king in his counting room. \nHe shuts the door. Leans against the fridge door. Hitch waits but she gives nothing away...until she off-handedly places the pages on the table... \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Well? \nShe doesn't look up... \nALMA Hire him. \nINT. UNKNOWN ROOM - DAY \nClose on a blank page being fed into a Corona typewriter. FINGERS pound out \"PSYCHO\" \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nBY JOSEPH STEFANO. \nEXT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE - MORNING \nThe door opens and Hitchs step outside. The Cadillac is waiting. \nAlma follows him out and makes a final adjustment to his tie. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK The only thing worse than a visit to the dentist is one to the censor. \nALMA Whatever you do, Alfred, don't lose your temper. \nINT. PRODUCTION CODE ADMINISTRATION OFFICE - DAY \nThe intimidating plaque for the MPAA's \"PRODUCTION CODE ADMINISTRATION OFFICE\" on the wall. \nStefano's TITLE PAGE is tapped angrily by GEOFFREY SHURLOCK, 70s, the much-feared administrator for the Motion Picture Production Code. He sits at the head of a big table with TWO ASSISTANTS. Sitting opposite are Hitchcock, Peggy and several silent PARAMOUNT EXECUTIVES. \nGEOFFREY SHURLOCK The Code will absolutely not permit you to show a knife penetrating a woman's flesh. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK I assure you, Geoffrey, my murders, are always models of taste and discretion. \nGEOFFREY SHURLOCK Is there any improper suggestion of nudity in this murder scene in the shower? \nALFRED HITCHCOCK She won't be nude. She'll be wearing a shower cap. \nShurlock makes a note. A man utterly devoid of any sense of humor. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nGEOFFREY SHURLOCK We might accept a shot from outside the bathroom window with Marion in silhouette above the shoulders -- provided the glass is frosted. \nHitch greets the suggestion with barely concealed contempt. Shurlock turns the page. \nG EOFFREY SHURLOCK Then -- this scene with the toilet. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK It's completely necessary. Marion flushes evidence later found by her sister. It's a clue to the girl's disappearance. \nGEOFFREY SHURLOCK No American movie has ever found it \"necessary\" to show a toilet, let alone to flush it. \nHitch turns to Peggy and a Paramount Executive. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Perhaps we ought to shoot the film in France and use a bidet instead? \nNo response from Shurlock's end of the room. Peggy stares down at the table. \nGEOFFREY SHURLOCK Mr. Hitchcock, if this office denies you a seal, and we're certainly heading in that direction, your movie will not be released in a single theater in this country. Will you be making jokes then? \nHitchcock gives a slow but meaningful shrug. \nGEOFFREY SHURLOCK (CONT'D) Good. Now why don't we go all the way back to page two... \nON HITCH \nboiling with rage as we hear the flurry of script pages -- \nINT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE, BEVERLY HILLS - DAY \nSunlight filters through sheer curtains revealing Hitchcock trying his best to recline on an ANALYST'S COUCH. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Everyone in Hollywood resents me. I make them millions... and yet every year I sit at those dreadful award show dinners, waiting for them to say, just once, \"You're good.\" \nHe looks around the luxurious office. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) They take sadistic pleasure in denying me that one little moment. \nANALYST'S VOICE That must hurt. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Deeply. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK How so? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nHitch's calmness is strangely reassuring to the young actor... \nANTHONY PERKINS I was incredibly close to my mother. So close I remember wishing my father would drop dead. And then when I was five, he did just that...He keeled over from a heart attack. (LAUGHING NERVOUSLY) You see I've been guilty my whole life, Mr. Hitchcock. \nHitch is enthralled. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Try to remember this is all just make believe. \nPerkins wishes he could be more reassured... \nANTHONY PERKINS Not to be prudish, but how far do you plan to push Norman's relationship with his mother? \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Further than you can possibly imagine. \nOn Perkins uncertain expression -- what is he letting himself in for? \nEXT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, GARDEN - DAY \nHitchcock's RED SWEATING FACE as he grunts and heaves. He's dressed in gardening gear, laboring in the full bloom of the rose garden. Alma pushes a WHEELBARROW filled with manure. \nShe shovels the manure around the rosebushes. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK I'm getting blisters just looking at you. \nALMA Stop grumbling. A bit of fresh air and exercise is exactly what you need. \nHe holds his PRUNING SHEARS menacingly over a deep red Sydonie rose. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nALFRED HITCHCOCK If I could get Grace Kelly to play the girl, they'd let me get away with anything. \nALMA Well you can't. She's a princess now which makes her permanently unattainable. \nHitchcock beheads the ROSE, muttering to himself. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK And all the more desirable. \nHis shears are now poised over a yellow specimen. \nALMA Lew suggested Deborah Kerr. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Too... Scottish. \nHitchcock cuts it too and moves on to the stem of a perfect pink rose. \nALMA What about Janet Leigh? She's always the `good girl' but she did awfully well in Touch of Evil. Lew mentioned her name. Do you remember how you always remarked on her figure at the Wassermans' parties? \nAs the shears hover on the stem, unsure whether to cut... \nMATCH CUT TO: \nINT. CHASEN'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nTHE SLENDER WAIST AND AMPLE BOSOM OF JANET LEIGH as she elegantly enters the dining room of Chasen's. \nHitch stands to greet her, his eyes follow her across the room in some private rapture.. \nAlma watches as Janet removes her glove and shakes Hitch's hand...before he guides her to the spot to his left, across from Alma. \nINT. CHASEN'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nHitch finishes telling his story... \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Of course the real secret of Mrs. Simpson's appeal to the Duke of Windsor was that she could make a toothpick feel like a cigar. \nHe's so deadpan... it takes a moment before she laughs. \nJANET LEIGH You know, I've been so immersed in preparing to play Marion I'd almost forgotten how to laugh. \nHitch summons the waiter with a snap. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Now, you must try the banana shortcake. \nJANET LEIGH Nothing for me, thank you. I'm watching my figure. \nAlma watches all this with a fixed smile. \nALMA You're not the only one. (to the waiter) We're fine, thank you. \nINT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, KITCHEN - MORNING \nA vase of flowers, none of them pink, in the center of the table. Hitch STARES into a refrigerator filled with boring tasteless health-conscious food. \nAlma enters briskly and holds up a handwritten LIST. \nALMA I've made a list of places where we can tighten our belt. \nShe places the list on the table. \nALMA (CONT'D) It wouldn't hurt for us all to learn the art of self restraint. \nHitch goes over and picks it up, and reads. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK The gardeners only once a week and weekends off for the driver? No. Absolutely not. We'll find other places to cut. \nALMA There aren't any other places. And furthermore, they'll be no more shipments from Maxim's either. We can't afford it. \nShe snatches the list out of his hand. \nALMA (CONT'D) The foie gras at Chasen's is more than adequate. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK But those geese are from Barstow not Marseilles. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nShe turns back to him. \nALMA We all have to make our little sacrifices for the greater good, don't we, Alfred? \nShe leaves Hitch to resume contemplating the contents of the fridge...but there's nothing there to satisfy his growling hunger. He SLAMS the fridge and -- \nINT. ED GEIN'S HOUSE - DAY \nSuddenly we're moving through an empty living room, prowling, just like in a Hitchcock movie as we hear CLUNKING, then move over to catch a glimpse of Ed as he drags A WOMAN'S BODY, feet-first up the stairs. The clunking is from her head on the steps, which is wrapped in her dress. \nINT. ED GEIN'S HOUSE, BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS \nEd approaches the shower curtain, then yanks it open with a METALLIC SCREECH. He pushes the body into the tub. Pulls the dress off her head and drops it on the floor. \nED GEIN Stay here. I'm going to get the knives. \nWe pan to REVEAL HITCHCOCK standing in the corner. He looks terrified but completely enthralled -- he can't resist creeping forward for a thorough inspection. Hitch's POV as he steps closer to the tub and glimpses the woman's blood- spattered WHITE BRA and GIRDLE. \nSuddenly -- FINGERS CLUTCH the rim of the tub. \nDEAD WOMAN Help me. \nHitch recoils but she LURCHES UP and GRABS his throat. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Ed! Ed! \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, BEDROOM - NIGHT \nHitchcock bolts upright in bed, face beaded with sweat in the moonlight. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Ed... Ed...? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nIt takes a moment to get his bearings. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Am I making a mistake? \nAlma stirs in her bed. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) What if it's another Vertigo? \nALMA Oh, shut up. Just get the first take under your belt you'll be fine. \nBut Hitch isn't looking convinced. \nEXT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY \nA sign posted outside the soundstage reads, \"PRODUCTION REHEARSALS 9401. ABSOLUTELY NO VISITORS!\" It only makes passing REPORTERS AND WORKERS more curious. \nINT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - CONTINUOUS \nInside, it's a hive of quiet purposeful activity. A.D. HILTON GREEN escorts VERA MILES across the far side of the stage. She's 30, a classic blonde porcelain beauty in the Grace Kelly mold. \nPEGGY I still can't believe you cast Vera Miles as the sister. \nHitch sits in his director's chair reading a copy of the London Times. \nAs he escorts her onto the soundstage, Tony comes up to greet them. \nANTHONY PERKINS I want to thank you again for this opportunity, Mr. Hitchcock. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK It's just \"Hitch\", Tony. Hold the cock. \nJanet caught that -- she's clearly amused. Tony gives her a gracious peck on the cheek. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Look at you two. America's favorite boy and girl nextdoor... \nJanet flicks a glance back at Hitch. \nJANET LEIGH And we're about to move to a whole new neighborhood. \nAlready, Tony can't help feel a little excluded from Hitch and Janet's little clique. Hitch ushers them across the soundstage where the crew are assembling. \nVERA MILES Morning Janet. Morning Tony. \nVera Miles marches up in her frumpy tweed suit and wig. \nVERA MILES (CONT'D) \"Thanks\" for the wardrobe, Hitch. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (already moving past her) That's hand-woven imported camel hair from Rodier. Don't you approve? \nVERA MILES You're the genius. \nShe checkmates him with a ravishing smile. \nVERA MILES (CONT'D) One thing, though. My script is missing the last ten pages. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Everyone's is. Until Alma finishes the revisions. Now hurry along, Vera. You're just in time for the oath. \nVERA MILES The what? \nHe steers her towards a line of laughing CREW MEMBERS forming a circle with the rest of the cast. \nHe takes Janet by the hand, placing her right next to him and officiously raises his right hand. The cast and crew duly follow suit, all except for Vera. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK I solemnly promise... \nCREW I solemnly promise... \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (ignoring Vera's sarcasm) That I will not divulge the plot nor the many secrets of Psycho... \nCREW That I will not divulge the plot nor the many secrets of Psycho... \nWE SEE VERA'S CROSSED FINGERS BEHIND HER BACK \nThen tilt up to Janet's look of mock disapproval. Vera pokes her tongue out. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK To friends, relatives, trade reporters or columnists -- not even to outgoing President Dwight D. Eisenhower, God bless him. \nEveryone cracks up, but Hitchcock's only interested in the reaction of his new blonde, standing in pride of place, right beside him. \nINT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, KITCHEN - SAME TIME \nALMA sits at the desk typing away at the revisions for \"Psycho.\" -- we see the title page. \nA tiny solitary figure with nothing for company but a vase of wilting flowers... \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nShe pauses, takes off her glasses and pushes aside her corrections, suddenly fed up with the all the work. \nShe looks out at the swimming pool, sparkling in the sunlight... then turns to the expensive-looking SHOPPING BAG half-open on the side... \nWe hear a LOUD SPLASH -- \nEXT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, POOL - DAY \nAs Alma plunges into the water wearing her striking new swimsuit. She breaks into a front crawl. Her strokes are vigorous, surprisingly so. \nShe drives the length of the pool, her arms slashing through the water with increasing speed, her feet kicking out with rising intensity... harder and harder... faster and faster... \nINT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY \nHitch guides Janet and Tony across the sound stage to the set of Norman's parlor. \nANTHONY PERKINS Now, Hitch, explain to me why I'm watching Marion undress? \nJANET LEIGH I feel like I should take offense at that. \nShe and Tony laugh. Hitch's eyes light up at this display of mischief from her. \nINT. HITCHCOCK'S OFFICE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - CONTINUOUS \nHitchcock loosens his collar and catches a glimpse of himself in a mirror. He's unraveling and it shows. \nBARNEY BALABAN (O.S.) I demand to see some footage, Hitch. \nHitch lowers the window blinds over Balaban's face and fumbles for the phone. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Connect me to Maxim's of Paris. \nHe takes the key and opens the liquor cabinet ignoring the INSISTENT KNOCKING at the door -- \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) (ON PHONE) Yes, it's Alfred Hitchcock in Hollywood, California, Jean-Claude. I need three pounds of foie gras sent on the next flight out. (THEN) That's correct. Three. \nHe pours himself five fingers of scotch. \nEXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - DAY \nA majestic view of the coastline as Whitfield Cook's Cream MERCEDES 190CL, zooms along, top down. Alma wears white- rimmed sunglasses and a head scarf. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nWhitfield, in true Hitchcock leading man style, has the perfect amount of wind blowing through his hair. \nWHITFIELD COOK Those steaks haven't changed at all, have they? \nALMA It's so nice not to have to take care of someone, even if it's just for an hour or two. \nShe takes in the sparkling scenery whipping past. \nALMA (CONT'D) Whit, where are we going? You still haven't told me. \nWHITFIELD COOK I have a little surprise. \nALMA A surprise. How fun. \nWhit just smiles as he jams the acceleration and the car ROARS off down the highway. \nEXT. HITCHCOCK'S OFFICE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY \nHitch stands in the parking lot tapping his foot impatiently near the parked Ford Fairlaine police car used in `PSYCHO'. Janet watches him, sitting behind the wheel of her VOLKSWAGEN BEETLE. After a moment she toots her horn and drives up. \nJANET LEIGH What happened to your driver? \nALFRED HITCHCOCK I've been asking myself the same thing. \nShe smiles. \nJANET LEIGH I can give you a ride if you want. \nHitchcock raises an eyebrow at the tiny car, and then, with great effort inches his massive frame through the open door. INT. CAR - MOVING - DAY \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Did you know Adolf Hitler sketched the design for this car on Ferdinand Porsche's cocktail napkin in a Berlin beer garden? \nJANET LEIGH I didn't. \nShe turns to see Hitch wedged uncomfortably into his seat. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK It's only now that I truly appreciate just how diabolical Herr Hitler was. \nShe notices him eyeing the half-eaten bag of CANDY CORN on the dashboard (the kind Norman Bates enjoys throughout \"Psycho\".) \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) May I? \nJANET LEIGH Help yourself. (letting him in on it) I pinched them from Tony's dressing room. \nHe takes one and chews it curiously. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK So this is what they eat at the drive- ins... \nHe takes the whole bag and sets to work, popping them in one after the other. \nJANET LEIGH I thought you only ate Fauchon chocolate. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Needs must when the devil drives, my dear. \nHe's so deadpan but now there's no way to tell if he's joking or not. She puts the car into gear, sensing his despair. \nEXT. SANTA BARBARA BEACH - DAY \nTWO PAIRS OF FEET \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nnesting in the sand. Alma and Whit sit out watching the surf. The water laps over their toes. \nINT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, BEDROOM - NIGHT \nHitch lies in bed, his thoughts racing as he waits for Alma to come home. \nFinally, the sound of the car comes up the driveway. \nHe turns onto his side and pulls up the blankets, listening to the sound of the front door ... and Alma's footsteps down the hall. \nShe quietly slips into the bathroom and shuts the door before turning the light on. He watches her shadow through the strip of light at the bottom of door. \nWhen the bathroom light switches off again Hitch hurriedly closes his eyes. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nAlma emerges in her nightgown and stops at his bedside, peering down on him. She's not completely sure that he's actually awake, but she suspects. \nINT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, BEDROOM - NIGHT (LATER) \nHitch eases himself up and looms over Alma to make sure she is safely asleep. \nHe silently picks up her HANDBAG and takes it to the window. Using the moonlight he searches its contents. Car keys. Lipstick. Purse. \nAnd the first few pages of a story outline: \n\"TAXI TO DUBROVNIK\" \nThe pages vibrate in his hand as his gaze lowers to reveal the rest of the TITLE PAGE: \"STORY TREATMENT BY WHITFIELD COOK & ALMA REVILLE.\" \nINT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT (LATER) \nA GLISTENING MOUND OF FOIE GRAS spooned into Hitchcock's mouth straight from the MAXIM'S OF PARIS tin. Hitch stands in the glare of the open fridge, a beast feeding in its cave, shoving in mouthful after mouthful. It's almost pornographic in its indulgence. \nGEIN steps out of the shadows and puts a comforting hand on Hitch's shoulder. \nWe hear the civilized CLINK of cutlery against china... \nINT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, DINING ROOM - DAY \nHitch and Alma sit at the table having lunch. Alma eats a pork chop while Hitch defiantly nibbles at his healthy salad. He has a nice big glass of red wine which Alma ignores. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK So I read your finished treatment. \"Taxi to -- \" Where was it? \nALMA Dubrovnik. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK That's it. Dubrovnik. Care to hear my opinion? \nALMA Yes. Naturally. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nALFRED HITCHCOCK There's no other way of saying it. It's stillborn. Dead in the water. \nAlma blinks, unable to hide her shock. \nALMA How so? \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (with mock compassion) The plot's a muddle. Some of the jokes are awfully like things we already did better hundreds of years ago in The Lady Vanishes. And your villain is weak. But the biggest failure is the relationship between the hero and heroine. \nHe picks up a radish and bites into it. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) If you weren't so smitten with your friend Whitfield cook you'd probably see that. \nAlma is entirely stunned. Hitchcock has delivered the killer blow he intended. He gets up and goes over to the garden door. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Women never really care to face the truth when their hearts are involved, do they? \nAs he steps out into the garden -- \nALMA How would you know what really goes on between a man and a woman? \nEXT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, GARDEN - CONTINUOUS \nHitch searches his pockets for his lighter but can't find it. His annoyance only increases when he notices the SCATTERED LEAVES `contaminating` the surface of the pool. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Look at this mess. \nHe grabs the net and starts scooping them out. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Bloody belt-tightening. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nHe can't get the net into the inflow filter so he gets down on his hands and knees and starts PULLING OUT the leaves with his hands. \nALMA \nJANET LEIGH My mother always said, \"Have confidence in yourself and you can lick anything.\" \nHitchcock takes Janet's hand, and with tremendous sincerity : \nALFRED HITCHCOCK My mother used to say the same thing. (THEN) Let's go for a take. Quiet everyone. \nOver and over, Margo attacks with the knife and Janet tries deflecting the blows but both women are timid and Janet is clearly guarding her modesty and covering her body. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Cut. More intensely. Let's go again. \nMargo's KNIFE comes at Janet uncertainly and every which way. Naked and exposed, Janet defends against the knife blows as they come at her but Margo's still pulling her punches-- \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) No. More angry. You are possessed with unbridled homicidal rage. (LEAPING UP) Cut. Cut camera. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nHe charges over to Margo to demonstrate the savage stabbing gesture he demands. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Does no one understand what I'm trying to accomplish here? I'm older than anyone on this stage and I'm still standing. \nEveryone falls silent, unsure how to respond. Hitchcock HOLDS OUT HIS HAND. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Give me the knife. \nMargo places the knife in Hitchcock's palm. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Props. Bring in more blood. \nA FEMALE MAKEUP ASSISTANT squirts more CHOCOLATE SYRUP \"blood\" onto Janet from a PLASTIC BOTTLE OF BOSCO. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Roll camera. \nAs the scene is marked, we see Hitchcock's anxiety. There is NO SOUND except Hitchcock's ragged breathing. \nCREW MEMBER Ready, sir. \nHitchcock nods. The camera whirs. Hitchcock hoists the knife into the air with terrifyingly convincing power and malevolence. \nTHE SHOWER CURTAIN GETS YANKED BACK -- \nWe see in the shower from Hitchcock's POV not Janet but GEOFFREY SHURLOCK. Hitchcock SLASHES the censor a killer blow that sends him reeling. \nTHE SHOWER CURTAIN GETS YANKED BACK AGAIN -- \nShurlock is replaced by BARNEY BALABAN. Hitchcock stabs him with unleashed fury and hate. \nTHE SHOWER CURTAIN GETS YANKED BACK AGAIN -- \nWHIT turns, he's naked and smiling. Hitch plunges the knife into his back, and he drops, revealing ALMA, arms around his waist. THE SHOWER CURTAIN GETS YANKED BACK AGAIN -- \nWe're back in the real moment -- JANET LEIGH SCREAMING as she gives the `performance' of a lifetime. \nHitchcock stops stabbing. His heart pounds. He's soaked with sweat. The only sound is the drip-drip-drip of the shower... \nON HITCH \nAs he realizes EVERYONE is staring at him. He straightens his tie, attempting to regain some semblance of control. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Print. We've got it. \nHe exits quickly. \nRita escorts the shaken and exhausted Janet off set, passing Vera who's witnessed the whole thing. She's wearing a bathrobe. Janet gives her a look as if to say `Now I understand.' \nINT. HITCHCOCK'S OFFICE - UNIVERSAL REVUE - CONTINUOUS \nHitch shuts his office door and leans back against it. He closes his eyes, nauseated and dizzy. He doesn't even need to open them to know who's there, waiting for him. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Not now, Ed. It's really not a good time. \nHe staggers towards the water cooler, fumbling for a cup. \nEd steps forward and pours him some water, pats his shoulder. \nED GEIN You just can't keep this stuff bottled up. \nBut before Hitch can drink it he crashes to the floor. \nEXT. HITCHCOCK'S OFFICE - UNIVERSAL REVUE - SAME TIME \nPeggy and Perkins to react to the noise... \nHITCHCOCK'S OFFICE - UNIVERSAL REVUE - SAME TIME \nThey come through the door to see Hitch lying on the floor. He looks like he's dead. \nOn the stereo. Alma finds Hitch on the sofa swaddled in a blanket and eating ICE CREAM. \nALMA May I turn that down? \nShe silences the stereo. Hitch doesn't react. \nALMA (CONT'D) You'll be pleased to know order has been restored. \nHe still doesn't look at her, masticating loudly. \nALMA (CONT'D) A thank you would be nice. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK We're still two days behind and sixty thousand over budget. \nALMA I already cancelled the wrap party. That'll save us two thousand right there. And you won't be tempted by any champagne and cake. \nShe pulls at the bowl of ice cream. He refuses to let go. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Beware -- all men are potential murderers. \nShe yanks it from his grip. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) With good reason. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nALMA Alright, what's this about? \nHe slowly pulls the ASPIRIN BOTTLE from his robe pocket, building suspense as he unscrews the lid and pours SAND into a tiny pile on the coffee table in front of him. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Spending a lot of time at the beach? \nHe puts down the bottle, looking for a reaction. \nALMA That's where Whit and I are writing. He's rented a place. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Hardly the ideal setting to avoid distractions. \nALMA Actually, it's very conducive to creative collaboration. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK I already told you -- that treatment is a waste of time. \nALMA Didn't everyone say the same thing about \"Psycho\"? \nShe reaches for the ASPIRIN BOTTLE to throw it away but Hitch grabs it first -- \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Are you and Whit having an affair? \nALMA Don't be absurd. He's working on something new and needs a little help, that's all. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK What a coincidence. I'm working on something new and I could use a little help too. \nALMA What do you think I've been doing? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Then why are you spending all hours of the day and night with some overage, talentless mamma's boy? \nALMA Because it's fun. \nHe quivers, livid. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK I am under extraordinary pressures on this picture, the least you can do is give me your full support. \nALMA Full support? We've mortgaged our house. My house. \nAlma's eyes flash with unaccustomed hurt and fury. \nALMA (CONT'D) Might I remind you that I have weighed-in on every aspect of this film so far, as I have done on every picture you've done in the last three decades. And the first time you show the film, it will be my notes that you want. I celebrate with you if the reviews are good and I cry for you if they are not. I host your parties and put up with those fantasy romances with your leading ladies. And when you're out promoting this film around the world, I will stand beside or, rather, slightly behind you, smiling endlessly for the press even when I'm ready to drop, being gracious to people who look through me as if I were invisible because all they can see is the grand and glorious \"Alfred Hitchcock.\" \nHitchcock is stunned and silent. \nALMA (CONT'D) Now, for the first time in years, I dare to work on something that isn't \"an Alfred Hitchcock Production\" and I'm met with accusation and criticisms. This work I'm doing with Whit gives me pleasure and purpose. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) \nALMA (CONT'D) And even though that takes absolutely nothing away from you, please consider this a reminder: I am your wife, Alma Reville, not one of the contract blondes you badger and torment with your oh-so- specific direction. \nShe turns and, with great dignity, leaves Hitchcock sitting in the gathering gloom. He's not the only one who can deliver a killer blow. \nINT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY \nON HITCH \nwith that same lost expression on his face, only now dark shadow and harsh light alternate across his features. \nShe starts the car and drives off. \nWhit watches, deflated, knowing he's ruined everything, his receding figure swallowed up by flickering white light... \nINT. SCREENING ROOM, PARAMOUNT STUDIOS - DAY \nWE PLAY THIS SCENE ONLY OVER THE FACES OF A SMALL INVITED AUDIENCE -- THEIR EXPRESSIONS TELL US THAT THE FOOTAGE THEY ARE SEEING IS NOT GOING OVER WELL. NOT AT ALL. \nLew sits with Barney Balaban and two executives. Lew discreetly checks his watch out of boredom. Shurlock and his two Assistants look appalled. Composer BERNARD HERRMANN, late 40s, prickly, sits in the back row looking suicidal. He glances back at Hitchcock who stands near the screening room door looking worse, if that could be possible. \nEXT. SCREENING ROOM, PARAMOUNT STUDIOS - LATER \nShurlock exits and approaches Hitchcock who's waiting in the foyer. \nGEOFFREY SHURLOCK You're going to have to cut all that nudity. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK What nudity? It was suggested. \nGEOFFREY SHURLOCK I definitely saw that knife jabbing her. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK We did no such shot. \nGEOFFREY SHURLOCK I'd stake my reputation on it. I'm recommending you cut the shower scene entirely. \nHitchcock is livid but holds his tongue. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nALFRED HITCHCOCK I'll go over it frame by frame and set up another screening. \nBut Shurlock is already walking away... \nWasserman emerges from the screening room conversing with BALABAN. Hitch searches their expressions for some indication but Balaban strides off without saying a single word to him. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) What's the verdict? \nLEW WASSERMAN Let's just say it was a four-letter review and it wasn't `good'. \nThe harsh reality devastates Hitchcock. \nLEW WASSERMAN (CONT'D) Screw him. It's too late for Paramount to back out no matter what Balaban says. \nHitch just stands there. \nLEW WASSERMAN (CONT'D) The other route is to recut it as a two- parter for the TV series. Because of the budget and the Hitchcock name, we stand a good chance of breaking even. \nStill, Hitch doesn't say a word. \nLEW WASSERMAN (CONT'D) Look, I made Jimmy Stewart a millionaire of Winchester 73 and that was a dog. At least I could sit through your picture. \nHitch stares bleakly off. He can't help noticing the KIM NOVAK-TYPE he spied on earlier outside, hand in hand and kissing her date. \nLEW WASSERMAN (CONT'D) More importantly, what does Alma think? \nINT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY \nAlma sits with the Hitchcocks' ACCOUNTANT going over the books again, looking at the revised figures. They close the books and sit back and look at each other. \nALMA Is there anything else we can do? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nSilence. This time he can't bring himself to look her in the eye. \nACCOUNTANT We'll just have to wait and see how the movie turns out. \nAlma gets up and crosses to the window. Stares out at the pool reflecting a leaden sky... and the clumps of dead leaves floating across its surface... \nALMA Well, it is only a house. \nINT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, STUDY - NIGHT \nThe dogs, GEOFFREY and STANLEY, lap away at a water bowl in the study. A splash or two of something is added to the bowl from above. It's being poured from Hitch's brandy glass. \nHITCH \npours himself another glass, leaving the dogs lapping happily away as he goes over to the Steinway Grand. There's a bank of silver-framed PHOTOS on top. He pauses to take a proper look at them. \nHis and Alma's life together in movies. Smiling at Premieres with Cary Grant and Grace Kelly. On vacation with Jimmy and Gloria Stewart. At a black tie event with Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck. \nBut it's the PHOTOGRAPH tucked away at the back that he wants to see most. \nA BLACK AND WHITE PUBLICITY STILL taken on the set of The Mountain Eagle in 1926. He picks it up and looks at it: \nThe young Hitchcock in front of the camera, dramatically calling \"Action!\" on his first film. His eyes don't have to move far to find ALMA, standing just behind him, making notes on her clipboard, the same intense, serious look on her face. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Whit isn't worth a damn when he's not working with you. (PAUSE) And neither am I. \nAlma takes in his reflective expression, but says nothing. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) I didn't pull off the picture this time. It just sits there, refusing to come to life. (THEN) There's no other way to say it... It's stillborn. \nALMA turns away. \nHitch sits there bereft in the lonely silence. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) I let you down, my love. \nHe moves closer and takes her hand. Gives it a small squeeze. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) You deserved better. \nShe still doesn't move. After a moment Hitch gets to his feet. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) I'll go and feed Geoffrey and Stanley, shall I. \nHe exits with the dogs padding after him. She turns back to the screen and more of that stilted, mannered dialogue. \nTears well in her eyes. \nEXT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE - NIGHT \nA full moon. The ONLY LIGHT from inside the house is the one in the kitchen. \nWe glimpse the figure in the window. A corpulent man in profile, like a Hopper painting. INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, KITCHEN - LATER \nHitch sits in his nightgown, pushing some VEGETABLES around his plate -- his healthy midnight snack. \nAlma enters in her robe. Hitch watches her. She goes to the fridge, opens the PRODUCE DRAWER and from under the brussel sprouts pulls out a tiny hidden jar of BELUGA CAVIAR. \nShe gets the crackers, a plate and a spoon and sits down at the table next to him. \nALMA I don't think I can stand both of us being maudlin. \nShe fixes several crackers, each with an appropriate dollop of caviar on top, and puts the plate in the middle. \nALMA (CONT'D) There is one solution to all this, you know. \nShe offers him one of the crackers. \nALMA (CONT'D) We could both get to work -- together. \nTentatively, Hitch accepts it. \nALMA (CONT'D) That tiresome little Hitchcock imitation I've been helping Whit finish is done. \nHitch remains quiet, delicately consuming his cracker. \nALMA (CONT'D) So I suggest, for everyone's sake, we start whipping Psycho into shape tomorrow. You may not be the easiest man to live with but you know how to cut a picture better than anyone. \nHitch puts the lid back on the caviar. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Except for you. INT. EDITING ROOM - NEXT DAY \nA series of quick shots as the editing room comes to life : CANS OF FILM ARE BROUGHT IN BY ASSISTANTS, STRIPS OF CELLULOID ARE PULLED OUT, INSPECTED AND MARKED WITH CHALK WHILE OTHERS ARE SPLICED TOGETHER. \nHITCH and editor GEORGE TOMASINI wait quietly like schoolboys, while Alma reviews the footage on the Moviola. \nALMA You'll need to cut those six or seven frames where she blinks after she's supposed to be dead. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK We've seen the footage a thousand times. She doesn't blink. \nAlma gives him a look ... \nINT. EDITING ROOM - LATER \nFILM HANGS EVERYWHERE IN BINS \nFOUR ASSISTANTS are working on MOVIOLAS. Alma and Hitch work their way down the line, inspecting each new assembly. \nALMA (FIRST MOVIOLA) Take thirty frames off the head... \nALFRED HITCHCOCK No, no, the second take, the light is better on his hands. \nALMA (NEXT MOVIOLA) Only cut back to Janet once the car's already moving. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Cut it tighter. The minute I lose one person I've lost the whole audience. \nTWO PAIRS OF HANDS. Hitchcock's and Alma's. They work like a pair of twenty-year-olds at a pair of MOVIOLAS cutting the picture. \nANGLE LOOSENS -- to reveal George Tomasini has dozed off, exhausted. \nShurlock gestures his staff out. Hitch moves closer. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) I have a modest proposal to make. If you're willing to leave the shower sequence as it is, I will reshoot the opening love scene to your exact specifications. \nShurlock reacts with surprise. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) In fact, I'd welcome your personal supervision on the set. \nShurlock is more flattered than he'd care to admit. \nGEOFFREY SHURLOCK My specifications? \nALFRED HITCHCOCK If only audiences could fully appreciate how tirelessly you work to help us entertain them while protecting them from filth and indecency. \nShurlock studies Hitchcock's sphinx-like expression. INT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY \nHitchcock and Peggy confer. John Gavin and Janet Leigh, wearing robes, chat while lying on a bed. Crew members wait impatiently. Peggy checks her watch. \nPEGGY He's been harassing you since you announced this project, you invite him to the set, and he doesn't even show up? What did you tell him? \nALFRED HITCHCOCK That I respected him. Deeply. \nPeggy laughs. Now she understands. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Ladies and gentleman, that is a wrap. Thank you all. \nThe crew starts breaking things down. The actors are baffled. Janet walks over to him. \nJANET LEIGH I thought we were reshooting the scene. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK No need. The charade is over. \nHitch holds out his arm for her and walks her back to the dressing room. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) See, I wasn't that much of a monster to work with, was I? \nJANET LEIGH Not at all. \nHe offers his hand and she shakes it, determined to be professional to the end. \nJANET LEIGH (CONT'D) I just hope I was sufficiently loyal to the cause. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Worthy of a Purple Heart, my dear. \nShe leans in and gives him a peck on the cheek. A moment of unexpected heaven that leaves Hitch speechless. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nShe walks away to her dressing room. Hitch watches as she steps inside and closes the door. \nAfter a moment we hear a PIERCING SCREAM -- \nINT. JANET LEIGH'S DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nJanet recoils at the sight of A MRS. BATES PROTOTYPE \"PROP MASK\" grinning lewdly from her chair, and wearing one of Janet's brassieres. \nHitchcock peeks inside as crew members come running. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK I hope you don't mind, I told Mrs. Bates she could have your dressing room. \nON JANET \nShe can't believe she's been caught out. She closes the door on everyone... and then after a moment SCREAMS AGAIN... but this time not out of shock. \nINT. HITCHCOCK'S OFFICE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY \nHitch sweeps in. Lew is waiting for him. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK We have our seal from Shurlock's office. (DEVILISHLY) Now, we lead the lambs to the slaughter. \nHitch turns to Lew for the latest news. \nLEW WASSERMAN The front office confirmed. They're only opening the movie in two theatres, as we suspected. And no premiere. If we don't get word of mouth we're dead. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Then we'd better get started. Peggy, take a memo... \nPeggy whips out her steno pad. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) We're going to write a manual on exactly how to sell Psycho. INT. PRINTING PRESS - DAY \nBOOKLETS make the rounds on a conveyor-like contraption. As the booklets are bound by swift-moving WORKERS, we see Hitchcock's photo on a cover and his \"advice\" to theater owners. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (V.O.) My first instruction to Theater Owners: Hire Pinkerton guards to strictly enforce our unique admission policies. \nINT. NEW YORK THEATRE - FLASH FORWARD \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Ready for the gallows? \nINT. NEW YORK THEATRE, LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER \nThe atmosphere is tense as people hurry to their seats. Lew greets them. \nLEW WASSERMAN We've roped off some seats for you. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK You go on ahead. \nALMA Are you sure? \nALFRED HITCHCOCK I'll join you in a minute. \nOff Alma's look. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) I want to double check the print. \nALMA Fine, darling. I'll save you a seat. \nLew escorts Alma and Peggy into the auditorium. \nINT. NEW YORK THEATER, PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT \nThe soothing whir of the projector as Hitchcock stands next to it... but the sound of the audience below TITTERING NERVOUSLY is anything but reassuring. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (under his breath) But they're laughing too much. \nHe peers down through the tiny window but can't see a bloody thing. INT. NEW YORK THEATRE, DOWNSTAIRS LOBBY - A MINUTE LATER \nHitch inches open the door and PEERS THROUGH THE CRACK at the audience but now he can't read them. Are they gripped with suspense -- or do they just hate it? \nFrom the lobby we see \nHITCH \nas he closes the door and leans back against the wall of the empty corridor. A scared, lonely, corpulent figure. Totally powerless. \nThere's nothing for him to do but wait. \nAnd wait. \nAnd wait. \nAcross the foyer, a spotty young THEATRE EMPLOYEE sweeps up ticket stubs and empties ashtrays, quietly going about his business, entirely oblivious... \nON HITCH'S FACE \nAs he grips the railing. This is taking far too long. \nAnd then -- finally -- the sweetest sound in the world A BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM. \nSoon the WHOLE AUDIENCE SCREAMS IN TERROR... then breaks into LAUGHTER again... nervous laughter this time, the best kind. \nHITCH \nAs he gestures with his hands, a conductor leading his orchestra, raising them up again as the audience STARTS SCREAMING AGAIN right on cue \nPUSHING TIGHTER ON HITCH \nAs the dam breaks and all the pent-up emotion floods out... leaving only relief and satisfaction... and making way for a smile... the largest of his whole career. \nINT. NEW YORK THEATRE - LATER \nHitch, Alma and Peggy are led out into the foyer by the theatre manager. There are still SCREAMS in the theatre as the show continues. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nLew can be seen on the phone in the theatre manager's office in the background as Hitch, Alma and Peggy walk past the line of ticket buyers to get to the front doors. There is great excitement now as more and more people recognize the Hitchcocks... \nWOMAN WAITING ON LINE Mr. Hitchcock, how does it end? \nALFRED HITCHCOCK I promised Mother I wouldn't tell. \nHe gets a laugh. Hitchcock walks alongside the Theater Manager who's not going to miss out on having his own moment with the crowd. \nTHEATER MANAGER Mr. Hitchcock, what do I do now that my wife won't take a shower after seeing your movie? \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Have her dry-cleaned. \nLaughter as Lew appears. \nLEW WASSERMAN I just got off the phone with Balaban. I couldn't resist telling him we're sold out for the next two weeks. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK What did he say? \n", "test1_input": "JANET This is the brand I wear. \nHitch digests the information and turns to Rita. \nHITCHCOCK We're ready for a fitting. \nAs Rita starts to measure Janet's chest, Hitchcock lifts his hands and `frames' her... \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (V.O. PRE-LAP) We travel across the rooftops of downtown Phoenix and finally, through the heat, pick out a certain hotel window... \nINT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY \nClose on Hitchcock's FRAMING HANDS as they now travel up to an open window with blinds half down... \nALFRED HITCHCOCK We go under the blinds and match dissolve into the room itself... INT. SOUNDSTAGE, BEDROOM SET - LATER \nHITCHCOCK'S HANDS have now become THE CAMERA, recording the scene already underway and now watched by HITCHCOCK, his DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY and CREW from across the stage... \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (V.O.) We pan over and discover John and Janet on the bed. \n...the camera moves to Janet and John making out on the bed. It's serious stuff. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) She'll be wearing only her undergarments and a large glow of satisfaction... \nJANET smiles up at John contentedly. \nON HITCH \nwatching from his directing chair. Peggy stands next to him. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Cut. \nPEGGY Good luck getting this one past the censor. \nEXT. STUDIO GATES, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY \nAlma drives the gleaming black Cadillac through the UNIVERSAL GATES and pulls up to the production office outside the stage. \nEXT. HITCHCOCK OFFICE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY \nAlma collects the script pages off the front seat and walks into the production office just missing Whit as he strolls back towards the writers building with a couple of pretty SECRETARIES. \nWhit pauses when he spots the Hitchcocks' CADILLAC. \nWHITFIELD COOK You girls go on ahead. \nThe PRETTIEST ONE stops to make Whit light her cigarette before catching up with the others. INT. HITCHCOCK OFFICE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY \nPeggy reads the final pages while Alma inspects the production boards. \nPEGGY If you ask me, the credits should read \"Screenplay by Joseph Stefano and Alma Reville.\" \nALMA The people who matter know. That's all that counts. \nAs she makes a few more changes to the schedule. Alma turns to Peggy whose face tightens as she continues reading. Clearly it's strong stuff. \nPEGGY I'd hate to see Shurlock's face when he reads this. \nShe puts the pages down. \nPEGGY (CONT'D) Alma, you always know the answer. Is this really going to work? \nA candid moment between the two women... but Alma doesn't answer, just leaves. \nEXT. HITCHCOCK OFFICE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY \nAlma emerges into the sunshine and looks across at the soundstage, wondering whether she should go over there... \nWHITFIELD COOK Hello, stranger. \nShe turns to see Whit leaning against the Cadillac. \nALMA Whit. \nWHITFIELD COOK Where have you been hiding yourself? \nALMA I've been doing the revisions on... \nShe points to the PSYCHO HOUSE on the ridge. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nWHITFIELD COOK Psycho. (THEN) And how is the old boy? \nALMA In a state of unbridled ecstacy now that he's back on the set. \n", "test1_true": "ALMA Not bad. I've got eight hundred words to do for Reader's Digest on what it's like to be married to a man obsessed by murder. \nHe looks at her a moment. \nWHITFIELD COOK I've got a better idea. \nHe steps closer. \nWHITFIELD COOK (CONT'D) Why don't we drive out to Santa Barbara? We'll have Emilio fry up those juicy steaks we like at El Encanto. \nHe playfully tugs at her sleeve. \nWHITFIELD COOK (CONT'D) No shoptalk ... No silly magazine articles...just a wonderful meal... \nAlma's expression gives away nothing as we pan over to the WINDOW of the production office and notice the tell-tale BEND in the blinds. \nINT. HITCHCOCK OFFICE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - SAME TIME \nHitch looks out at Whit and Alma through the window, just like he did with the other couple earlier. Except this little interaction is far from dull. \nA.D. HILTON GREEN We're ready for you on the set, Mr. Hitchcock. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK I'll be right there. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nBut Hitch doesn't move. \nA.D. HILTON GREEN Mr. Hitchcock? \nINT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, FOYER - DAY \nALMA enters the silent, empty house smiling to herself. She walks through to - \nINT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY \n- and puts the grocery bags down on the counter. She listens. The house is eerily quiet, until, from behind -- \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Was there a line at the market? \nAlma looks up, but doesn't turn round, well used to Hitch's cryptic ways. \nALMA No. Actually, I'm back sooner than I expected. \nShe puts on an apron and gets to work, preparing dinner. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Would you like a cocktail? \nHe heads for the liquor cabinet. \nALMA No. (he starts to head off) And you shouldn't either. \nHitchcock stops. Pulls out a CELERY STICK from one of the bags and bites it. \nALMA (CONT'D) Those haven't been washed yet. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CHEWING) I don't care. (THEN) I was filming all day with John Gavin -- a good-looking chap but, really, plywood is more expressive. His love scene with Janet may be most horrifying thing in the picture. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nHe takes another BITE, searching her face for some tell-tale sign of guilt. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Even your friend Whitfield Cook would be better in the scene. \nALMA You should tell Whit that. He'd be flattered. \nShe gets to work preparing a salad. Hitch studies the back of her tiny, vulnerable neck, the delicate sinews and muscles as they rise and flex. \nINT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, BEDROOM - NIGHT \nHitch arranges his pillows and settles into bed while Alma finishes getting ready. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Maybe I was too dismissive about your friend Whitfield's book. Perhaps he and Elizabeth could come over this weekend and he can walk me through it. \nAlma's radar activates but Hitch continues oh-so- nonchalantly. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Lovely woman, Elizabeth... \nHe carefully folds his blanket as if wrapping a murder victim. She's not exactly sure what he's implying but she knows she doesn't like it. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) I was hoping you could come by the set tomorrow. \nALMA I'll see how my day shapes up. \nShe turns onto her side away from him. Pulls the blankets around her, her eyes still WIDE OPEN. \n", "test2_input": "ALFRED HITCHCOCK (PRE-LAP) You think you can get away with it but you can't... \nAlma's eyes become HITCHCOCK'S EYES, staring ahead intently. INT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - CAR SCENE - DAY \nALFRED HITCHCOCK ... You think they can't tell... but they can. They know. It's all closing in on you. The noose is tightening... \nAs he continues, we pull back and see: \nTHE REAR-PROJECTION SET \nJanet emotes for Hitchcock's CAMERA while \"driving\" a PARTIAL CAR, being rocked by STAGE HANDS. \nPeggy and other CREW time and mark the takes. ELECTRICIANS AND GAFFERS turn mounted lamps that rake across Janet's worried face like car headlights. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) You could return the money secretly, but what would be the point? \nHe wipes his brow, getting more intense... \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) You, Marion Crane. The prim and proper girl who's always been so tight and respectable. So perfect and untouchable. Well, they know all about your dirty little secret, don't they? Your messy, sticky lunchtime trysts. Yes, your boss Mr. Lowery could even smell the sex on YOU-- \nSUDDENLY THE REAR SCREEN film breaks and a frame burns. \nIt's a good thing because Janet is starting to look a little uncomfortable -- was that meant to be funny? As technicians yell and hustle, Hitchcock turns to Peggy -- \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Circle that. \nINT. JANET LEIGH'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY \nAs Janet gets changed, Vera hangs up her frumpy coat on a rack, looking over a little enviously at Janet's good girl/bad girl underwear hanging nearby. \nVERA MILES Have you talked to him much about your personal life? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nJANET LEIGH Not really... \nVERA MILES I'd keep it that way if I were you. (Off Janet's look) He starts by choosing your hairstyle and clothes and then he wants to choose your friends and decide how many children you should have. \nJanet finds this a little hard to believe. Vera leans in, lowering her voice. \nVERA MILES (CONT'D) That poor, tortured soul Jimmy Stewart played in Vertigo? That's Hitch, only younger, slimmer and better-looking. \nThat may well be true but it doesn't bother Janet. \nJANET LEIGH Compared to Orson Welles, he's a sweetheart. \nThey both turn, sensing something -- and see HITCHCOCK'S DISTINCTIVE SHADOW PROFILE in the hallway. The shadow lingers, then recedes like in a scary ghost story. \nVERA MILES (WHISPERS) See? He's always watching. \nThey laugh nervously. \nINT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME \nAlma comes in from her gardening, and settles on the sofa with a cup of tea, a circled copy of TV Guide next to her. \nOn television -- the 1950 Hitchcock classic Stage Fright. The credits come up: \"Screenplay by Whitfield Cook, Adaptation by Alma Reville.\" \nAlma watches, thrilled at the sight of her name and Whit's together. \nON THE TV \nThe words \"DIRECTED BY ALFRED HITCHCOCK\" overwhelm the small screen. Alms puts down her fork, no longer hungry. INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, HALLWAY - DAY \nALMA heads back to the kitchen, only to pause at the open door to Hitch's study -- there's something on the desk. \nINT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, STUDY - CONTINUOUS \nTHE HITCHCOCK BLONDES \nHitch's personal collection. Alma enters and starts to go through them. Each photo is turned over a little more roughly than the last. It's hard to tell whether she's more angry at the photos or the fact that they've been deliberately left for her to find... \nAlma takes off an earring, picks up the phone and starts to dial... \nINT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - SAME TIME \nAs the crew prepares the car set to go again, Hitch strides over to PEGGY who's dialing a phone. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK What's the hold up? \nPEGGY It's still engaged. \nHe takes the phone himself just as Vera Miles emerges from her dressing room, script in hand. \nVERA MILES Hitch, I'm stuck on Lila's first scene. I don't know how strongly I should confront Sam and the detective and I -- \n", "test2_true": "He turns his back on her and dials. The ENGAGED TONE blares in his ear. His eyes narrow at some crew members fussing with bits of LIGHT and SOUND EQUIPMENT. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Does it really require two men to carry a light stand? \nA.D. HILTON GREEN I'll take care of it right away, Mr. Hitchcock. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nHe rushes off to fix it. Off Peggy's questioning look. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK It's different when their pay is coming out of your own pocket. \nHe raps the receiver button, more intensely this time, and redials. \nINT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, STUDY - DAY \nBut Alma's still on the phone to Whit, basking in his charm. Her feet are up. There's a drink in her hand. \nWHITFIELD COOK (ON PHONE) Well, I think that sounds like a fabulous idea. We'll have a late lunch. I'll make the reservation for one thirty. \nALMA What would I do without you? \nWHITFIELD COOK Till then, bye. \nShe hangs up, toying with her earring, feeling better already when the PHONE rings again very quickly. She picks up without even thinking -- \nALMA (LAUGHING) What did you forget now? \nINT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - CONTINUOUS \nPudgy fingers clench the coiled PHONE CORD as we move up to Hitch's face. He's silent as a burglar, not even daring to breathe... \nALMA (ON PHONE) Whit? Is that you? \nThe blood drains from Hitch's face as he very slowly and carefully replaces the receiver. His mind starts to spin. He's got to get out of there... \nCROSSING THE STAGE \nHitch lurches towards the production office, starting to sweat, but his path is blocked by GRIPS laying cables. The set is suddenly a cacophony of noise and chaos. \nA PR FLACK appears -- \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nPR FLACK Mr. Hitchcock, every press outlet is driving us crazy for photos -- \nHitch brushes past him to find another route but more grips are moving a ladder. He turns, kicks a platter of healthy snacks out of the way, only for an ARCLIGHT to swivel in his face and blind him. \nPEGGY Are you okay? You've gone very pale. \nPeggy's face suddenly comes into focus. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Stop trailing me like a puppy dog and get me something long, cool and wet. \nPEGGY It's not even three. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Give me the key! \nHe snatches it and pushes past her, leaving her flat. \nEXT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY - CONTINUOUS \nHITCH exits the soundstage doors, only to find the humorless face of BARNEY BALABAN blocking his office door. \nBARNEY BALABAN Hello, Hitch. How's the picture? I'm hearing interesting things... \nALFRED HITCHCOCK It's a wonder you can hear anything over the noise coming from the Shurlock office. \nBalaban offers up his handkerchief. Hitchcock waves it away even though he's now covered in sweat. \nBARNEY BALABAN I shouldn't be in a position of just hearing things, Hitch. It's time you showed me some footage. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Why? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nBARNEY BALABAN To see if you're making a picture Paramount can actually release. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK As you well know, Barney, my contract guarantees me final cut. \nBARNEY BALABAN Your contract also says Paramount isn't required to distribute any film that could cause us embarrassment. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Unlike the last five Martin and Lewis pictures you're all so proud of. \nHe slams the door in Balaban's startled face. \n", "test3_input": "Still clutching the phone, a little nonplussed. Peggy gives him a look: \"What did I tell you.\" \nINT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, BEDROOM - SAME TIME \nAlma removes the phone from Hitch's grasp. Touches his forehead. \nALMA No more phone calls. You're burning up. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Burning up our money. We're two days behind and I'm stuck in bed. \nHitch swings his legs out of the bed. \nALMA Where do you think you're going? \nALFRED HITCHCOCK To the set. We can't afford to lose any more time. Two more days of this and the whole production goes under. \nHe shakily tries to get to his feet. \nALMA You stay in bed. I'll deal with it. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK I'd hate to take you away from your writing partner. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nShe pushes him back against the pillows. He's too weak to resist. \nALMA Under the blankets. Now. \nINT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY \nCrew members sit around eating donuts. Assistant director Hilton Green and cameraman Jack Russell are still arguing over the mechanics of the shot with more crew members joining in. It's near pandemonium. \nThen Alma steps in the door, and everything stops. Every crew member snaps to attention as Alma passes by. It's like the school principal arriving after the substitute teacher has lost control. \nALMA Don't stop work because of me. I'm only here as one of the two people paying your salaries. \nAlma takes a seat in Hitch's DIRECTOR'S chair. As her eyes dart around the set, it's clear that she IS TAKING EVERYTHING IN. Peggy flanks her. \nALMA (CONT'D) Scene? \nPEGGY One seventy three. \nALMA Storyboards? \nPeggy hands the boards to Alma. She and Hilton quickly review the boards. \nALMA (CONT'D) Start with the overhead. We'll cut before the fall. Then we'll put Martin in a chair under the camera. \nHilton looks at Russell. Perfect. He sets ANTHONY PERKINS in his dress into place. \nALMA (CONT'D) (to the cameraman) And that lens should be a thirty-five. \nPeggy mouths Alma a silent \"THANK YOU\" for restoring order. INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, BEDROOM - DAY \nHitchcock lies in bed, tossing and turning, the fever only making his thoughts darker and more obsessive. \nED GEIN (O.S.) You forgot to look in the bathroom. \nHitch notices the SHADOWY FIGURE standing at the end of his bed. \nED GEIN (CONT'D) A man like you... Missing the vital clue like that... \nHe blearily sits up and sees Gein's impassive rustic face. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK What do you mean? \nGein steps over to the bathroom and pushes open the door. \nED GEIN My mother always said if you're going to do a job, do it right. \nINT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS \nHitchcock enters the immaculate white and chrome room and inspects it... but nothing seems out of place. \nED GEIN Check the floor. \nHe looks down but again, nothing. \nED GEIN (CONT'D) Closer. \nHitch gets down on his hands and knees. He runs his fingertips across the smooth white tiles. They start to COLLECT -- \nGRAINS OF SAND \nSprinkled all over the floor. \n", "test3_true": "Hitchcock's face hardens. His lip trembles. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nED GEIN (CONT'D) So what are you going to do about it? \nHitch gets up, opens the medicine cabinet and takes out a BOTTLE OF BAYER ASPIRIN. \nHe empties the tablets into the sink and very carefully, sweeps the SAND into the aspirin bottle. He caps it, slips it into his robe pocket and turns off the light. \nOMITTED \nINT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - SAME TIME \nAlma spots the towering figure of Balaban stride onto the stage accompanied by a MAN in a cardigan. \nALMA Barney. \nHe sees her and bristles, clearly surprised to see her there. \nBARNEY BALABAN Alma. \nAlma takes in Balaban's companion, and the viewfinder round his neck. \nBARNEY You know David Kirkpatrick. He's working on Jerry Lewis' next picture. \nShe does. They nod politely -- then stand there. \nBARNEY (CONT'D) So he's free to help... (a sly smile) if you need it... \nSilence. Just the bustle of crew members in the background. \nALMA That won't be necessary. \nBARNEY But you're nearly three days behind. \nHe takes a step towards Hitch's empty chair, but Alma moves to block his path. It may be a small gesture, but it's highly charged. \nBarney stares down at her. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nBARNEY BALABAN Alma. We both know what kind of film this is. (then, closer) The smart thing to do would be to help Hitch finish it. \nALMA Thank you for your concern, Barney. \nShe moves closer to him, holding his gaze, not bending one bit... \nALMA (CONT'D) But on a Hitchcock picture, there is only one director. \nThe anger flashes on his face as she faces him down, the entire crew behind her now, holding firm... \nEXT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY \nBalaban, incensed, leaves the stage with Kirkpatrick. Alma steps out into the sunlight not far behind them. As she watches them leave, she lets out a breath. \nA voice calls out to her -- \nWOMAN'S VOICE Mrs. Hitchcock? \nShe turns to see Janet walking over in Capri pants and a sleeveless top. She's carrying an elegantly wrapped package. \nJANET I hope you don't mind. I heard Hitch was sick so I got him a little something. \nShe hands Alma the gift. A bag of candy corn tied with a ribbon. \nALMA That's kind of you. \nJANET Well, he's been very considerate with me. (A BEAT) I haven't always had that from my directors. \nALMA Janet, you've been very... professional. It hasn't gone unappreciated. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nAlma takes in Janet's unaffected natural beauty -- and her sincerity. \nShe can't help but notice the second glances Janet is provoking from passers-by now... \nShe's an impossible rival for any woman. \nBEETHOVEN'S 3RD SYMPHONY, `EROICA' \nBlares deafeningly... \nINT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, BEDROOM - DAY \n"}

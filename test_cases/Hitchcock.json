{"test1_input": "HITCHCOCK \nWritten by \nJohn J. McLaughlin \nBased on the book Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho by \nStephen Rebello \nFADE IN: \nEXT. MARSHLAND - DUSK \nWe move across smoldering embers and reach a small grass fire. Dirt is thrown over the flames before a BOOT finishes stamping them out. \nSUPER: PLAINFIELD, WISCONSIN, 1944 \nHENRY GEIN (O.S.) We're just lucky it didn't reach the trees... \nWe move up two dirty pairs of overalls to find HENRY and ED GEIN sweating away as they continue shovelling out the flames. Both are in their forties and wearing flannel shirts. Ed wears an Elmer Fudd hat. \nHENRY GEIN (CONT'D) There's gonna be a lot more jobs at that factory by Milwaukee come June. I could put in a word. \nED GEIN You can't leave us, Henry. She needs both OF US-- \nHENRY GEIN Can you stop being a momma's boy for one second? \nHenry looks at Ed and he shrinks back. \nHENRY GEIN (CONT'D) I'm not trying to hurt you but Jesus you got to live your own life someday. That woman can take care of her own goddamn -- \nCLANG. Henry is hit by the shovel in the back of the head and goes down. \nEd steps slowly forward and puts down the shovel. The look on his face isn't anger. It's BLANK. He pulls at the flaps of his Elmer Fudd hat... then calmly walks away. \nThe camera pans until we discover : \nALFRED HITCHCOCK \nin his trademark black Mariani suit. He's been watching the whole thing, standing in the smouldering field only a few feet away, holding a rose-patterned cup and saucer of tea... \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nHe takes a sip and turns to address the camera -- \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Good evening. \nHe places his cup daintily back on the saucer. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Brother has been slaying brother since Cain and Abel, yet even I did not see that coming. I was as blind-sided as poor Henry over there. \nHe glances back over at the murder scene. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Apparently the authorities shared my naivete and believed the young man's tale that Henry fell and hit his head on a stone and died of smoke asphyxiation. \nHe shrugs: `Who would've thought it?' \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Of course if they hadn't believed him, Ed never would have had the opportunity to commit the heinous acts for which he became famous... and we wouldn't have our little movie. Instead, we'd have more nice, safe, predictable ones like these... \nCUT TO: \nA RAPID MONTAGE OF CLIPS \nfrom various Technicolor Films of the era: Peyton Place, with Lana Turner and Betty Field. Pillow Talk with Doris Day and Rock Hudson. A Summer Place with Sandra Dee -- \nEXT. MARSHLAND - AS BEFORE \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Mere Technicolor baubles. \nHe shudders with distaste. As if on cue the sky THUNDERS LOUDLY above him. He looks up and from behind the tree stump produces an umbrella. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Ah. A bit of doom and gloom. Now, that's more like it. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nAs Hitch opens his brolly and the RAIN starts to bucket down WE -- \nCUT TO : \nEXT. MARQUEE OF UNITED ARTISTS THEATER, CHICAGO - NIGHT \nEqually torrential rain lit up by rotating KLEIG LIGHTS as they scan a MARQUEE: \"WORLD PREMIERE! NORTH BY NORTHWEST. DIRECTED BY ALFRED HITCHCOCK.\" JOSTLING CROWDS run the length of the block. \nSUPER: JULY 8, 1959. \n", "test1_true": "ALFRED AND ALMA HITCHCOCK \nStep out into a sea of FLASHBULBS. Hitch basks in the limelight while Alma, his razor-sharp, charming wife of over 30 years stands in the background, uncomfortable with all the attention. \nHitchcock's agent LEW WASSERMAN, 45, dynamic, charismatic, comes into view. \nLEW WASSERMAN This thing is going to be gigantic. I wish I had twenty percent of the take. \nLew hustles them through the throng of REPORTERS and PHOTOGRAPHERS under their BLACK UMBRELLAS. \nREPORTER ONE Does tonight's incredible reaction surprise you, Mr. Hitchcock? \nALFRED HITCHCOCK No, when I was planning North by Northwest I could already hear the screams and laughter. (then, to a BEAUTIFUL BLONDE FAN) Any questions, my dear? \nThe blonde fan, holding out her autograph book, shakes her head `no' and giggles. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) A pity. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nThe reporters crack up. Alma manages a polite smile as Lew helps her into the limo, leaving Hitchcock alone for a moment to sign his autograph for the blond fan... \nREPORTER TWO Mr. Hitchcock, you've directed forty-six motion pictures. You host a hit TV show seen around the world. You're the most famous director in the history of the medium... but you're sixty years old. Shouldn't you just quit while you're ahead? \nHOLDING ON HITCHCOCK \nmotionless and quietly devastated as FLASHBULBS CRACKLE over his face. The whiteness transforms into... \nINT. THE HITCHCOCKS' BEL AIR HOME - BATHROOM - MORNING \nTHE GLEAMING WHITE TILES of a bathroom. We move past chrome fixtures that evoke those in Spellbound and Psycho and arrive at that same pudgy hand pouring CHATEAU CHEVAL BLANC '53 into a cut crystal glass. \nHITCHCOCK \nsoaks in the tub. The champagne glass beside him, his corpulent frame is covered only by the London Times he's reading. Even in this deeply vulnerable state, he maintains the air of a haughty mischievous emperor. \nAt the sound of a bedroom bureau being opened, Hitch's eyes shift to the FULL-LENGTH MIRROR on the bathroom door. \nIN THE MIRROR \nWe catch fleeting glimpses of Alma in a white half-slip and matching bra. She takes out some NYLONS and holds them up to the light. \nHitchcock watches enthralled. He puts down his glass and shifts a little in the tub, causing the water to lap against the sides. \nBEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nAlma pauses when she hears the small splashes. Neither upset nor amused she continues about her business, taking a skirt from the drawer. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nALMA Muhammad had the eyes of peeping Toms gouged out with arrows. \nHitchcock clears his throat, rattling his paper as if he'd been reading the whole time. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Talking of arrows, did you read Mr. Weiler's review in the New York Times? Apparently, he found \"the climax\" to be -- and I quote -- \"overdrawn.\" \nALMA I doubt whether Mr. Weiler has had a climax in years. \nAlma steps into her skirt as Hitch opens the London Times. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK And how about this little grenade? (READING) North by Northwest reminds us of Hitchcock's earlier, more youthfully inventive spy thrillers.\" (BEAT) And just to drive the nail into the coffin, there's a handy accompanying guide to the new masters of suspense. \nHitchcock zeroes in on the photographs. They're all young. Thinner. And with hair. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Why do they keep looking for new masters of suspense when they still have the original? \nALMA Don't be maudlin, you know how much it aggravates me. \nHe catches his reflection in the mirror again and sinks further down into the water to hide his protruding belly. \nAlma comes in, takes the newspapers from him and puts them on the side. \nALMA (CONT'D) Stop reading them. You've been reading them for a week now. \nShe puts down the TOILET SEAT and sits on it. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Tell me, dear. Am I really too old? \nALMA Yes. A true relic. And lest we forget, a notably corpulent one. \nShe comes over and kisses the top of his head. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK You always know precisely where to plunge the dagger, don't you? \n", "test1_id": 3156, "test2_input": "INT. HITCHCOCK'S OFFICE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - CONTINUOUS \nHitchcock loosens his collar and catches a glimpse of himself in a mirror. He's unraveling and it shows. \nBARNEY BALABAN (O.S.) I demand to see some footage, Hitch. \nHitch lowers the window blinds over Balaban's face and fumbles for the phone. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Connect me to Maxim's of Paris. \nHe takes the key and opens the liquor cabinet ignoring the INSISTENT KNOCKING at the door -- \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) (ON PHONE) Yes, it's Alfred Hitchcock in Hollywood, California, Jean-Claude. I need three pounds of foie gras sent on the next flight out. (THEN) That's correct. Three. \nHe pours himself five fingers of scotch. \nEXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - DAY \nA majestic view of the coastline as Whitfield Cook's Cream MERCEDES 190CL, zooms along, top down. Alma wears white- rimmed sunglasses and a head scarf. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nWhitfield, in true Hitchcock leading man style, has the perfect amount of wind blowing through his hair. \nWHITFIELD COOK Those steaks haven't changed at all, have they? \nALMA It's so nice not to have to take care of someone, even if it's just for an hour or two. \nShe takes in the sparkling scenery whipping past. \nALMA (CONT'D) Whit, where are we going? You still haven't told me. \nWHITFIELD COOK I have a little surprise. \nALMA A surprise. How fun. \nWhit just smiles as he jams the acceleration and the car ROARS off down the highway. \nEXT. HITCHCOCK'S OFFICE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY \nHitch stands in the parking lot tapping his foot impatiently near the parked Ford Fairlaine police car used in `PSYCHO'. Janet watches him, sitting behind the wheel of her VOLKSWAGEN BEETLE. After a moment she toots her horn and drives up. \nJANET LEIGH What happened to your driver? \nALFRED HITCHCOCK I've been asking myself the same thing. \nShe smiles. \nJANET LEIGH I can give you a ride if you want. \nHitchcock raises an eyebrow at the tiny car, and then, with great effort inches his massive frame through the open door. INT. CAR - MOVING - DAY \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Did you know Adolf Hitler sketched the design for this car on Ferdinand Porsche's cocktail napkin in a Berlin beer garden? \nJANET LEIGH I didn't. \nShe turns to see Hitch wedged uncomfortably into his seat. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK It's only now that I truly appreciate just how diabolical Herr Hitler was. \nShe notices him eyeing the half-eaten bag of CANDY CORN on the dashboard (the kind Norman Bates enjoys throughout \"Psycho\".) \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) May I? \nJANET LEIGH Help yourself. (letting him in on it) I pinched them from Tony's dressing room. \nHe takes one and chews it curiously. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK So this is what they eat at the drive- ins... \nHe takes the whole bag and sets to work, popping them in one after the other. \nJANET LEIGH I thought you only ate Fauchon chocolate. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Needs must when the devil drives, my dear. \nHe's so deadpan but now there's no way to tell if he's joking or not. She puts the car into gear, sensing his despair. \nEXT. SANTA BARBARA BEACH - DAY \nTWO PAIRS OF FEET \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nnesting in the sand. Alma and Whit sit out watching the surf. The water laps over their toes. \n", "test2_true": "WHITFIELD COOK He's like any great artist. Impossible to live with but worth the effort. (he throws a rock into the SEA) Van Gogh wasn't exactly a walk in the park either. \nALMA Did you know when we started out I was his boss? He didn't even dare ask me out until he'd worked his way up to assistant director. \nWhit watches as she picks up some sand, lets it run through her fingers... \nWHITFIELD COOK What do you think of that place over there? \nHe nods to a SMALL BEACH HOUSE up the way. \nALMA Looks nice. Terrific location. Why? \nWHITFIELD COOK It's mine. \nShe looks at him askance. Is he joking? \nALMA I just saw Elizabeth. Why on earth didn't she tell me? \nWHITFIELD COOK She doesn't know about it. \nEXT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE - DAY \nThe sun is setting on the Hitchcocks' driveway. The VW pulls to a stop in front of the front door. \nINSIDE THE CAR \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nJanet looks over -- decides to risk it. \nJANET LEIGH So what did happen between you and Vera? \nALFRED HITCHCOCK I was going to make her star. But she chose the life of a housewife. \nHe stops chewing. We push in as his features turn reflective. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) I cast her as the lead in Vertigo. Then two weeks before filming she told me was pregnant. \nHe screws up the empty bag of candy and looks over at Janet. Then, almost like a child -- \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Why do they do it? Why do they always betray me? \nON JANET \nAs she looks across and sees the lonely abandoned little boy just sitting there... \nEXT. SANTA BARBARA BEACH - SUNSET \nAlma enters the beach house cautiously and looks around. It is old and falling apart with only a few functional furnishings. \nWHITFIELD COOK I'm just leasing it for the offseason. A place to get away from the wife and kid and write. \nALMA Very Bohemian. \nWHITFIELD COOK You might find that room interesting. \nAlma looks. The door is partially open -- she sees the one conspicuously new item of furniture. A double bed. \nALMA Whit. I hope you haven't got the wrong idea. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nHe gives her a rakish grin, then pushes the door open further to reveal the deck beyond. \nTWO MAUVE CORONA TYPEWRITERS \nSit on a table facing each other. \nWHITFIELD COOK If you were serious about helping me adapt my book, I thought it would be the perfect hideaway. \nShe lets this sink in, entranced by the incredible view and the crashing surf. \nThen, she steps out onto the deck and up to one of the typewriters. Gives the key an approving TAP. \nINT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, FOYER - DAY \nHitch enters the empty house at dusk. The dogs greet him. He listens a moment... then walks through to the study. \nINT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, STUDY - CONTINUOUS \nHitch pours himself a brandy and downs it in one. He goes to pour himself a second, when he notices something on the desk. \nIt's his collection of PHOTOS by the TELEPHONE. They're all neatly stacked. \nWith a SINGLE GOLD EARRING on top. \n", "test2_id": 3157, "test3_input": "INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, BEDROOM - NIGHT \nHitch lies in bed, his thoughts racing as he waits for Alma to come home. \nFinally, the sound of the car comes up the driveway. \nHe turns onto his side and pulls up the blankets, listening to the sound of the front door ... and Alma's footsteps down the hall. \nShe quietly slips into the bathroom and shuts the door before turning the light on. He watches her shadow through the strip of light at the bottom of door. \nWhen the bathroom light switches off again Hitch hurriedly closes his eyes. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nAlma emerges in her nightgown and stops at his bedside, peering down on him. She's not completely sure that he's actually awake, but she suspects. \nINT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, BEDROOM - NIGHT (LATER) \nHitch eases himself up and looms over Alma to make sure she is safely asleep. \nHe silently picks up her HANDBAG and takes it to the window. Using the moonlight he searches its contents. Car keys. Lipstick. Purse. \nAnd the first few pages of a story outline: \n\"TAXI TO DUBROVNIK\" \nThe pages vibrate in his hand as his gaze lowers to reveal the rest of the TITLE PAGE: \"STORY TREATMENT BY WHITFIELD COOK & ALMA REVILLE.\" \nINT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT (LATER) \nA GLISTENING MOUND OF FOIE GRAS spooned into Hitchcock's mouth straight from the MAXIM'S OF PARIS tin. Hitch stands in the glare of the open fridge, a beast feeding in its cave, shoving in mouthful after mouthful. It's almost pornographic in its indulgence. \nGEIN steps out of the shadows and puts a comforting hand on Hitch's shoulder. \nWe hear the civilized CLINK of cutlery against china... \nINT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, DINING ROOM - DAY \nHitch and Alma sit at the table having lunch. Alma eats a pork chop while Hitch defiantly nibbles at his healthy salad. He has a nice big glass of red wine which Alma ignores. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK So I read your finished treatment. \"Taxi to -- \" Where was it? \nALMA Dubrovnik. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK That's it. Dubrovnik. Care to hear my opinion? \nALMA Yes. Naturally. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nALFRED HITCHCOCK There's no other way of saying it. It's stillborn. Dead in the water. \nAlma blinks, unable to hide her shock. \nALMA How so? \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (with mock compassion) The plot's a muddle. Some of the jokes are awfully like things we already did better hundreds of years ago in The Lady Vanishes. And your villain is weak. But the biggest failure is the relationship between the hero and heroine. \nHe picks up a radish and bites into it. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) If you weren't so smitten with your friend Whitfield cook you'd probably see that. \nAlma is entirely stunned. Hitchcock has delivered the killer blow he intended. He gets up and goes over to the garden door. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Women never really care to face the truth when their hearts are involved, do they? \nAs he steps out into the garden -- \nALMA How would you know what really goes on between a man and a woman? \nEXT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, GARDEN - CONTINUOUS \nHitch searches his pockets for his lighter but can't find it. His annoyance only increases when he notices the SCATTERED LEAVES `contaminating` the surface of the pool. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Look at this mess. \nHe grabs the net and starts scooping them out. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Bloody belt-tightening. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nHe can't get the net into the inflow filter so he gets down on his hands and knees and starts PULLING OUT the leaves with his hands. \nALMA \n", "test3_true": "HITCH \nPulls out handful after handful of wet leaves, clawing away at them like a madman... \nA TEMPERATURE DIAL INCHES INTO THE RED \nINT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - SET \nStage hands and engineers test a row of HOT WATER TANKS installed on the set. \nWE FOLLOW the sound of rushing water through a PIPE as it snakes across the set floor and passes through a fake wall to \nA SHOWER HEAD \nUnleashing a stream of STEAMING HOT WATER. The SET HAND gives the thumbs up. \nSET HAND Tell the boss we're ready. \nINT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY \nPeggy and A.D. Hilton Green exchange a glance as Hitchcock paces up and down in the corridor, eager to get to work. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK What's the hold-up? Call time was two hours ago. \nPeggy nervously knocks on Janet's door and peers inside -- \nINT. JANET LEIGH'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY \nRita Riggs is hard at work molding MOLESKIN PATCHES to Janet's nipples. \nJANET LEIGH And you're sure this moleskin will stay put? \nRITA RIGGS Mr. Hitchcock promised. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nNeither woman looks convinced but they proceed with blind faith. \nJANET LEIGH It better. I'm going to be taking a shower all week. \nAs Janet slips on her robe, a MOLESKIN TRIANGLE PLOPS onto the floor. Rita and Janet share a worried look. \nEXT. BEACH HOUSE, SANTA BARBARA - DAY \nAlma sits at her typewriter while Whit stares off, looking a little uncertain. \nALMA Forget what Hitch said. He's just feeling his age. He'll come around. \nWHITFIELD COOK But he's right. It does need more feeling. \nAlma ponders the problem. Finally -- \nALMA So why don't we put some in? \nShe gets to her feet and starts to pace... \nALMA (CONT'D) All we need is a better catalyst. Some innocuous little trigger to release all that underlying desire. \nThe soothing sound of the ocean gives way to the relentless HISS of SHOWER WATER -- \nINT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - MOTEL SHOWER SET - DAY \nJanet nervously removes her bathrobe and heads toward the MOCK SHOWER STALL. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Good morning. \nHe takes her hand and guides her into position. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) As I explained earlier, this scene will be made up of many shots from Mr. Bass's boards. A series of looks - actions... (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Well, you're the professional. You'll know how to do it. \nAround them, the crew frantically finalize the CAMERA and LIGHT SETUPS. MALE CREW MEMBERS look uncomfortable and excited by the unprecedented sight of a virtually nude movie star. \nSaul Bass comes over with his boards and Hitch and he discuss the planned shot a moment. \nFIRST A.D. HILTON GREEN Tony's stunt double is ready. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK Ah. There's our murderess. \nInto frame steps Anthony Perkins' FEMALE STUNT DOUBLE, MARGO, wearing a gingham dress, silver wig and BLACK MAKEUP TO MASK HER FACE. She wields a large PROP KNIFE and almost blocks our view of Janet in the white-tiled stall. \nALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) (TO JANET) Are you ready for our little bloodbath? \n", "test3_id": 3158}

ALI But did you enjoy it or not? 
STEPHANIE I did. A beat. 
ALI When you're up for it and you can't find anyone, ask me. If I'm oper, we'll do it. 
STEPHANIE What's "oper"? 
ALI Operational... If I'm available. If I can, I mean! 
STEPHANIE If you're "oper" we... 
ALI Yeah. She sketches a vague gesture. 
ALI What? Her throat is constricted, she is unable to answer. 
STEPHANIE Nothing. Great. 
87. EXT. MARINELAND - STAFFROOM. DAY 
Stephanie uses one of her canes to push open the door to the staff room. The room is apparently empty. 
STEPHANIE Louise? Louise, are you here? Is anyone here? No answer. She looks over the office she once knew so well and that hasn't seen again since her accident: the photos on the wall, the diagrams, the case histories, the animals' names, etc... 
88. EXT. MARINELAND - BLEACHERS. DAY 
Up in the bleachers, Stephanie looks over all the pools, the big one as well as the others... suddenly, in nÂ° 3, a huge but limp black dorsal fin appears. 
89. EXT. POOL N3. DAY 
Weighed down by her prostheses, Stephanie has to lie down on the rim of pool nÂ° 3 to reach the water. She reaches out and slaps the water with the palm of her hand. Nothing 
really happens, a black mass just keeps circling at the bottom of the pool... She slaps again and the black mass swims faster and faster... a wave is formed around the sides of the pool, a wave that swells higher and higher... Stephanie's hand again slaps the water and, suddenly, Niska emerges. 
CUT TO: 
90. EXT. POOL N3 - DAY 
Niska washes up. Stephanie caresses her and weeps softly, like someone caught unawares. 
LOUISE (OFF) (gently) Stephanie? Stephanie looks back to discover Louise and three other ex- colleagues. They have been there a moment, surprised, unsettled and ill at ease. 
STEPHANIE I stopped by the office but there wasn't anyone. Stephanie stands up with the help of her canes. The guys rush over to help her. They hug and kiss. All four remain like that for a moment. 
91. EXT. MARINELAND - CAFETERIA. DAY 
Sun and music. The public is beginning to invade the lanes and paths. Stephanie, Louise and the other keepers are on the terrace of the employees' cafeteria. They are thrilled and reassured to see her again. At times a hand touches her arm or shoulder. Sometimes an acquaintance comes over and kisses her. Under the table, Stephanie types âoper?' into her cell phone, then looks up and returns to her surroundings. We can imagine the "How are you?" "And you?" "Great". The "Let me get a look at you... You look wonderful!"...all a 
bit strained, but friendly. Louise, who is sitting next to her, leans over to her: 
LOUISE (softly) See? It wasn't hard! They smile at each other and return to the conversation in progress. Stephanie's cell phone vibrates on the table. She discreetly checks the answer, and when she looks up, exchanges a glance with Louise. From that glance, we cut to: 
92. INT. SUPERMARKET. DAY 
Stephanie and Louise are out shopping. Stephanie holds herself up thanks to the shopping cart she is pushing. We join their conversation already in progress. 
STEPHANIE When I feel like it, I send him a text message and ask if he's oper. If he is, we hook up. Louise reacts. 
LOUISE What's oper?

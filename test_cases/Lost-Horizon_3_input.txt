. . . And that's the whole story, George. He died as peacefully as the passing of a cloud's shadow. His last words to me were, "I place in your hands, my son, the future and destiny of Shangri-La." Now you know why I can't leave. 
George listens to him intently, his face a mask of apprehension. He stares at his brother for some time and finally rises and walks around for a few moments. 
GEORGE 
(running his hand through his hair) 
Well, I - I really don't know what to say. Except that you must be completely mad. 
CONWAY 
So you think I'm mad? 
GEORGE 
What else can I think after a tale like that? Good heavens, Bob, things like that don't happen today. We're living in the twentieth century. 
CONWAY 
So you think it's all nonsense, huh? 
290. MED. SHOT - THE TWO 
GEORGE 
I think you've been hypnotized by a lot of loose-brained fanatics. Why, I wouldn't believe it if I heard it in an English monastery. Why should I swallow it here in Tibet? How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof? 
CONWAY 
I don't need any proof. 
GEORGE 
(contemptuously) 
I knew there was a reason I hated this place. I'd give half my life to fly over it with a load of bombs just for what they've done to you. How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof? All this talk about the Lamas being hundreds of years old. How do you know? Did you see their birth certificates? 
(some more pacing) 
I can't believe it, Bob. A bunch of decrepit old men sit around and dream about reforming the world. And you, Bob Conway - two-feet-on-the-ground Conway - want to join them. It's horrible. 
CONWAY 
Is that all my story meant to you? 
GEORGE 
What else could it mean to me? It's obviously a lot of bunk. 
CONWAY 
Then you'd better go, George. This is no place for you. 
GEORGE 
It's no place for you, Bob. Think of what's waiting for you. Do you want to stay here until you're half dead? Until your mind starts corroding like the rest of them? 
CONWAY 
Please, George. I don't want to talk about it anymore. 
GEORGE 
You've got to talk about it. What about me? You said they stole that plane to bring you here. I didn't want to come. You owe me some responsibility. 
CONWAY 
I'm tired of owing you things. You're free to go. Go ahead. 
GEORGE 
(suddenly) 
It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turnedÂ— 
CONWAY 
Enough! Never mind the girl! 
(a tense moment of silence) 
Well, why don't you go? 
Conway has sunk into a chair. George kneels before him, pleading. 
GEORGE 
Look here, Bob, Ever since I can remember, you've looked after me. Now I think you're the one that needs looking after. I'm your brother, Bob. If there's something wrong with you, let me help you. 
CONWAY 
(a murmur) 
Oh, George . . . 
GEORGE 
Besides, I - I don't feel like making that trip alone, Bob. 
CONWAY 
George, you couldn't possibly stay here, could you? 
GEORGE 
I'd go mad! 
CONWAY 
(after a moment's hesitation) 
George, I may be wrong, I may be a maniac. But I believe in this, and I'm not going to lose it. 
(warmly) 
You know how much I want to help you, but this is bigger, stronger if you like than brotherly love. I'm sorry, George. I'm staying. 
GEORGE 
(after a long pause) 
Well, I can't think of anything more to say. Goodbye, Bob. 
They shake hands warmly. George turns to leave. 
CONWAY 
(just as George reaches the door) 
George, are you sure of the porters? About their taking care of you, I mean? 
GEORGE 
(turning back) 
Oh yes. It's all set. Maria made the arrangements. 
CONWAY 
(glances up - surprised) 
Maria? 
GEORGE 
Yes, the little Russian girl. 
CONWAY 
What's she got to do with it? 
GEORGE 
She's going with me. 
Conway looks his extreme amazement. 
CONWAY 
(suddenly - wild) 
George, you're crazy! 
As he says this he jumps to his feet. George is startled by his tone and manner.

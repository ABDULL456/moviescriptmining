INT. MASRY & VITITOE, OUTSIDE ED'S OFFICE - DAY 
As Erin heads for the door, pleased glances fly from secretary to secretary.  Erin reaches the door, but can't open it with the box in her arms.  She turns to the room. 
ERIN I don't suppose any one of you cunts could open the fucking door for me. 
EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - DAY 
Erin's Hyundai rumbles to a stop in front of the house.  Erin shoves open the creaky, reluctant door, lifts her box of stuff off the seat, and gets out. 
As she walks around the car and toward the house, she runs into the MAILMAN.  He hands her a packet of mail. 
MAILMAN Here ya go, Miz Brockovich. 
Erin looks at the top of the stack.  It's the electric bill. 
INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MAIN ROOM - DAY 
Erin enters, puts down the box and stares at the mail. Bills, bills, and more bills.  As she throws them on the table, she sees George coming out of the kitchen. 
ERIN What are you doing here? 
GEORGE Fixing a leak under your sink. 
She heads into the kitchen, weary and irritated. 
ERIN I didn't ask you to do that.  Damn it, George, I don't ask you to do things like that. 
INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY 
Erin enters, sees all the cleaning stuff from under the sink is spread around the kitchen floor.  A tool box lies open. 
ERIN Great. 
GEORGE I'm gonna clean it up. 
Erin gets down on her knees and starts putting things away. 
GEORGE Relax, Erin, I'll do it -- I'm not -- 
Before he can finish, a huge WATER BUG runs onto Erin's hand. 
ERIN Ugh -- Jesus -- 
She jumps and brushes it off. 
GEORGE Yeah -- you had a whole family of those things hanging out back there. 
She takes off her shoe and smacks at the bug, missing it. 
ERIN Damn it -- 
The bug skitters away from her, along the floorboard.  Erin chases it, smacking at it repeatedly, missing it every time. 
GEORGE Don't worry about it, I'll get it later. 
But Erin keeps after it, corralling all her frustrations into killing that one bug. 
ERIN Come here, you little motherfucker -- 
The bug crawls up onto the table, zipping behind the salt, the pepper, the napkin holder.  Erin keeps after it, BANGING the table harder and harder with each SMACK of her shoe. 
GEORGE Hey, whoa -- relax -- 
The salt and pepper skid off the table.  The napkins fly from their holder.  Just as Erin's about to nail the bug, it slips into a crack in the wall and disappears.  Erin hurls her shoe at the crack.  It SMASHES into the wall. 
ERIN GOD DAMN IT! 
As Erin stands there staring at the wall, her breath starts to come heavily -- those deep breaths that precede tears. She slowly slides down into a chair, defeat overcoming her. 
ERIN (almost a whisper) ... God damn it. 
She looks around at her for-shit kitchen and starts to cry. 
ERIN What kind of person lives like this?  Huh? What kind of person lets her kids run around in a house crawling with bugs the size of housecats? 
GEORGE It's a simple thing.  Everybody gets them. All we gotta do is call an exterminator. 
ERIN I can't call an exterminator.  I can't afford one.  God, I can't even afford my phone. (beat) I got fired. 
GEORGE What?  But you been working so hard -- 
ERIN Doesn't matter.  Doesn't make one bit of difference. (then, fragile) Oh God, George, how'd this happen to me? How'd I end up so ... so nothing? 
George picks a napkin up off the floor, hands it to her. 
GEORGE You're not nothing, Erin. 
ERIN Well, I'm sure as hell not what I thought I was gonna be.  I was supposed to have one of those great lives, with everything all laid- out and perfect.  I mean, hell -- I was Miss Wichita, for God's sakes.  Did I tell you that?  You live next door to a real live beauty queen. (wipes her nose) I still got the tiara.  I kept it cause I thought it meant something.  I thought it meant I was gonna do something great with my life.  I thought it proved I was gonna grow up to be someone. 
GEORGE You are someone. 
ERIN No I'm not.  Look at me.  I'm not. 
GEORGE You're someone to me. (beat) You're someone real special to me. 
He takes a step toward her and kneels in front of her, very close.  He takes her shoe from her hand and puts it back on her foot.  Then he takes her hands in his and kisses them. 
ERIN I'm no good, George.  I make people miserable. 
But he kisses her anyway.  And for the first time in so long, she feels like something other than a failure.  He pulls her into him, and she lets herself be pulled.

CLOSEUP - ACCELERATOR PEDAL To reveal Vanessa's rigged a soda can to the pedal. An extension for her short legs. As her foot tromps down on the can... 
ANGLE - CAMPER takes off. The windows are blacked out and Vanessa can't see where she's going. But she's going. 
INT. HANGAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION The camper careens around the large space.   Charles scrambles after. 
INT. CAMPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION Vanessa keeps driving blind, pedal to the metal. 
INT. HANGAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION The CAMPER veers toward the rear wall.   And... ... CRASHES into a support post. As Charles yanks Vanessa from the wrecked van, unhurt... 
INT. KOREAN CLUB - DAY A hostess bar, but very high-end. Beautiful women. Elegant decor. Pumping MUSIC. No strip-club cheese. For extra money, private rooms for private pleasures. It's day, but the place is wall-to-wall with Korean men. Chambers' African-Americans maintain low visibility:   at the door, behind the scenes, counting the register, etc. ODION, a dangerous-looking Chambers main man, moves through the crowd to Daria, waiting near the front door. ODION Delicious Daria. DARIA 'Sup, Odion? ODION Long time no see. Then, checking her out -- ODION Like cognac. Just getting better. (then) So what brings you around? DARIA ... Sometimes you need an old friend, y'know? ODION Got trouble? DARIA ... With a capital 'T.' ODION Tony Fait? Thought you and him were tight. Bonnie and Clyde. DARIA Used to be that way. Not treating me right these days. The kid's all he cares about. ODION ... What do you want me to do? DARIA ... Man, I don't know. Probably nothing you can do. I just 
thought... (then) Hey, y'know, this is crazy. I don't know what I was thinking. I shouldn't even be here like this. Sorry, Odion. 
Daria starts to go.   Odion stops her. ODION Nah, hey, hold up. It's okay. DARIA Back in the day... Just always seemed like you and I had something special between us. 
ODION Didn't know you thought so. DARIA I always cared for you, Odion. That's why I'm here. ODION ... You looking for a job? DARIA I need something. ODION ... So maybe you could work here. DARIA Here?... Oh, man, I don't know. ODION You were the best. Not many girls pulling in two g's a night. DARIA Yeah, but it's been a while for that... Might not remember how. ODION Just like a bicycle, baby.     You don't forget that stuff. Daria considers it a moment. DARIA Don't know how Jump'd feel about it. Having me back. ODION Hey, you let me worry about Jump, 
okay? (then) Meantime, why don't you come on in, and you and me can, y'know, talk some more about it.

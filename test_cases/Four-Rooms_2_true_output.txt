TED Right! I knew that! 
He is backing away, into the circle, as she comes for him, soft and sweet. Her eyes are again putting the magic hex on him, as he tries to resist her gaze. 
TED What's a nice girl like you doing in a coven, anyway? 
EVA Well, see, what I really want to do is be a midwife. I've attended four births already! I can prevent vaginal tears and everything. 
TED (trying to dodge her hexing eyes) Well, that's a good thing! A guy doesn't like surprises down there. 
All the while she is stepping toward him into the circle. 
EVA I joined the coven to attain greater understanding of my feminine power so I could become a truly great midwife! 
TED (the hex working now) Oh, well, I see you've been gaining a lot of insight into your... girl powers... 
Eva sweetly takes his hand and places it on her breast. 
EVA Do you really think so? 
TED (buckling under the temptation) Well, yeah, I'd say that seems to be the case... (she licks his neck; his eyes roll back heavenly) Ohhh, God! Betty's gonna kill me! 
EVA Who's Betty -- your girlfriend? 
TED No. My boss. 
EVA Oh good! 
TED Oh no! 
They fall into a kiss, as she begins to remove his cap. She moves him toward the Jacuzzi, closer and closer. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. HALLWAY--NIGHT 
Ted pushes his room-service cart. He is flushed. Puffed up. Lights a cigarette, takes a great big, satisfied drag. Eva runs to the door dreamily, her naked body wrapped in her shawl. She passes him a card. 
EVA My phone number in Topanga. Call me? 
TED (cocky) Sure, baby. Yeah, I'll give ya a call. 
She smiles and shuts the door. The other witches are arriving with supplies from the garden. Kiva, now having raised her blood sugar, sucks on a lollipop, a sunny girl. She talks to Raven, who carries a birch limb. 
KIVA What's that used for? 
RAVEN It's a birch branch, symbolizing eternal life. You can also use the bark for a tea which assists in astral travel. 
KIVA Hey -- I wanna be a witch! 
The other girls roll their eyes as Elspeth smiles proudly. Ted blows smoke at them and pushes his cart off down the hall. The witches run inside the room. 
IN THE SUITE 
Eva sits, blissed-out, in the center of the circle, smiles. 
EVA I'm a woman now! 
ATHENA But where is his "stuff"? 
EVA (pointing to the Jacuzzi) We did it right there, in the big cauldron! 
JEZEBEL Ooohhh honey, you're gonna be sore tomorra! Didn't your mama teach you that water strips a girl's lubrication? 
RAVEN Sex in water is great in the movies, not in real life... but you will learn. As we all did. 
JEZEBEL Yeah, when she can't walk... (to Elspeth) I guess you wouldn't have those kinds of problems -- without penetration. 
ELSPETH No. And virtually no cervical cancer, either. 
ATHENA Okay, girls, enough Sex Education 101, let's get going with our ritual, goddammit. 
Athena regally leads the ritual as they all bare their breasts again. Kiva throws off her shirt to join in. As she does, we see black bondage tape on her nipples. Elspeth darts a quick look at the tape, looks at the other witches -- not sure she likes this -- but she goes with it. The witches sway in a circle, eyes closed, as Eva makes her offering. 
EVA Goddess Diana, I offer you The jism of one I wooed for you That you may live and know such bliss Of getting laid by a guy like this. 
The witches all incant. 
ALL OF THE WITCHES So must it be. Three times three times three. 
They march half-naked as they moan and revel in eerie cries. The Jacuzzi begins to bubble and boil. Their cries heighten; the potion bubbles over.

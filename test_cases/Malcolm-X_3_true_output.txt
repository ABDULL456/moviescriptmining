MALCOLM Your turn, Rudy. You want me to flip for you? 
RUDY Jesus Christ, no. Okay, okay. You got it, you got it! You're the boss. 
A beat. 
MALCOLM Don't never try to cross someone who ain't afraid to die. 
SHORTY You the man! 
Nodding accord from Rudy and Shorty. Sophia can hardly stand. 
MALCOLM All right. We'll start with Old Talcum Powder. You draw the house, where everything is. You and Peg go out and buy them tools like I told you. We hit tonight on account of in the daytime some of us got that high visibility. Ya dig? 
Rudy is at a table drawing a diagram; the girls have left. Shorty and Malcolm alone at a window. 
SHORTY What did you do, Homey, palm it? 
MALCOLM Yeah. 
He breaks open the gun -- the bullet is in the next slot to be fired. 
MALCOLM (contd) Palmed it right in the goddam chamber. 
SHORTY Jesus Christ, Homey, you are nuts. 
Malcolm starts laughing: a silent, hysterical laugh.

96F	--The sleeping OLD MAN, OLD TALCUM POWDER, as Malcolm takes a watch, a wallet from within inches of his pillow. Then, more boldly, picks up the man's hand and removes a ring from one of his fingers. Shorty watching with bated breath, he's about to have a heart attack. 
97	INT. MANSION - DAY 
A Boston matron, MRS. CRAWFORD, is showing the girls her collection of U.S. silver. In a fine New England home.

101	INT. A COURTROOM - DAY 
The prisoners face the bench: Peg, Sophia, Shorty, Rudy and Malcolm. 
VOICE OF MALCOLM X The average first offender gets two years for burglary. We were all first offenders. That's what Sophia and Peg drew-- 
JUDGE Two years in the Women's Reformatory at Framingham. 
VOICE OF MALCOLM X But our crime wasn't burglary. It was balling white girls. They gave us the book. 
JUDGE Burglary, count one -- 8 to 10 years; count two, 8 to 10 years; count three, 8 to 10 years... 
He continues giving them 8 to 10 years, behind Malcolm's comment: 
VOICE OF MALCOLM X Fourteen counts of 8 to 10 years. 
JUDGE The sentences to run concurrently. 
VOICE OF MALCOLM X Shorty thought he hit us with 114 years till I explained what concurrently meant. It meant a minimum sentence of 10 years hard labor at the Charlestown State Prison. The date was February 1946. I wasn't quite 21. I had not yet begun to shave. 
CAMERA HAS GONE IN for a TIGHT CLOSE SHOT of Malcolm's face: a hardened hustler, pimp, dope peddler and now jailbird at the ripe old age of 20. FREEZE FRAME. 
CUT TO BLACK. 
FADE IN: 
102	INT. THE CELL CORRIDOR - DAY 
It is the afternoon lockup: about 3:30 P.M. The line of PRISONERS stands in front of their cells, as two guards, WILKINS and BARNES, one white, one black, slowly walk past the P.M. check. 
The procedure is routine, done without emotion, as it is done three times a day: the black guard calls out the prisoner's name, the prisoner answers with his number, then steps into his cell. Whereupon the white guard slams the door shut and locks it. 
GUARD WILKINS Jackson. 
PRISONER A 231549. 
Door is slammed and gate locked. 
CLOSE - MALCOLM

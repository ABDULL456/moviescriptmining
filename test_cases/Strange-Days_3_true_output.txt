Zander nods: OK.  Lenny gives him the grip.  Zander's hand outmaneuvers his, and the boy smiles in triumph. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE 
POV: squid tape of Iris' death.  Quick barrages of the savage imagery interspersed with bursts of static... 
... until Tick slips off the trodes.  He's been totaled by what he's seen. 
TICK Whoa.  That is one unbelievable piece of eyefuck. 
LENNY Skip the art criticism, Tick, what can you tell me about the wearer. 
TICK Well... the guy's fucked up. 
MACE We know that, Tick. 
TICK No, I mean the killer's got some kind of distortion in his visual cortex.  The color and gray-scale values are all messed up, like color blindness. 
He gives the tape a fast run through his processing equipment. 
TICK Lookit, you see the peak period ratios there?  Could be some kind of tumor or brain lesion or something. Some kind of trauma (shaking his head) This is not good.  I don't like this at all... 
LENNY What? 
TICK Well, it's cutting awful close to me.  I mean she was just here. 
LENNY Who was just here? 
TICK Iris, man.  Pay attention. 
LENNY Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?! 
TICK Yeah, she came by last night. Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip. 
LENNY What clip?  What was it? 
TICK I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to see it.  She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin' 
LENNY She never gave me a tape. 
MACE (to Lenny) Think back about what she said. Exactly what she said. 
LENNY (revved up) She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car... 
MACE Something in your car... 
Lenny and Mace swap a look: oh shit. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  SAN PEDRO IMPOUND YARD - DUSK 
6:05  P.M. 
The last night of this millennium is falling.  Mace's limo pulls to the curb.  The yard is located in the vast no- man's land of storage lots, cranes and warehouses near harbor piers.  The impound office is locked.  Closed for New Years Eve. 
CUT TO Lenny and Mace cutting the chain off the gate with the long-handled bolt-cutters.  They enter the yard.  Mace is carrying a blunt object that looks like a ray-gun.  A TAZER. 
Right on cue a huge Rottweiller bounds out of the shadows at them, growling, its head low on an attack run.  Mace fires and the tazer lights up the with 120,000 volts (low amperage, not lethal).  It whines and flips over twice, then runs off behind some parked cars. 
LENNY That's a handy little attitude adjuster. (sees his car) Damn.  I'm boxed in. 
Lenny and Mace approach his BMW, blocked in by ten other cars, so he's not getting it back this trip.  He unlocks the door and looks inside with a tiny Mag-Lite while Mace covers them with the tazer.  A puppy-like whine comes occasionally from behind some cars nearby.  We catch a glimpse of the puzzled, snuffling Rottweiller eyeing them warily. 
Lenny finds the tape on the floormat, passenger side, still wrapped in the note.  He reads the note: "HELP ME. IRIS." 
MACE What's it say? 
He crumples the note. 
LENNY Nothing.  Let's go play this back. 
CUT TO LENNY AND MACE returning to the limo.  As they reach the car they are hit by two flashlight beams.  It is the two cops, SPREG AND ENGELMAN, out of uniform, but looking very serious with their pistols aimed at Lenny and Mace.  They have been following Lenny, knowing sooner or later he would lead them to the tape. 
SPREG Give me the tape.  Right now. 
LENNY What tape?  I'm just trying to get my car back but the place is closed-- 
SPREG Shut the fuck up Nero. 
Engelman grabs a fist-full of hair at the top of Mace's head and jams his 9mm into the back of her skull. 
MACE (cool and even) Lenny, give them the tape. 
LENNY It's in my case.  Okay?  I'm going to open my case...

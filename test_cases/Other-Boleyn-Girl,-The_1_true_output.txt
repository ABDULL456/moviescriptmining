SIR THOMAS BOLEYN gets to his feet.. 
SIR THOMAS It's my elder daughter, Anne, your Majesty. She has returned to court. 
HENRY What? That awful girl, Thomas? The one that almost killed me? (a beat) You allowed her back? 
SIR THOMAS The time abroad has done her good, your Majesty. I'm certain you'd find her much improved. 
HENRY Really..? 
HENRY looks down the table.. 
HENRY Well, come on. Where are you, other Boleyn girl? Show your face. 
ANNE slowly gets to her feet. HENRY looks up. When he sees ANNE's face, his face falls.. 
ANNE is a woman transformed. Gone are the simple clothes, puppy fat and lack of confidence. 
ANNE has become a glorious, head-turning siren; dressed in daring French clothes. 
er hood is half-crescent, and reveals the hair. Her neckline plunges sexily. Her sleeves are long and loose, offering daring flashes of arm and elbow.. 
Like every other red-blooded MAN in the room, HENRY is utterly mesmerised. Speechless.. 
HENRY So? What is so amusing, Anne? Perhaps we might hear and judge for ourselves? 
ANNE dark, intelligent eyes stare back at HENRY. Suddenly, all sound fades, and the world shrinks around them: it's as though they are the only two people in the room.. 
ANNE I was just giving my thoughts on the new French King. 
HENRY Which are..?

ANNE That for someone with such great wealth, and power..he has surprisingly little authority as a man. 
HENRY Hah! 
ANNE And is SO consumed by one particular rivalry he can barely think. 
HENRY eally? And who is this rival? 
ANNE A neighbouring King, who's name one is forbidden to mention at court. Whose reputation haunts him in his thoughts and dreams. 
ipples of laughter, as people guess.. 
ANNE Whose armies and navy thwart his every endeavour. Whose physical and intellectual endowments are known far and wide. 
ENRY laughs too. Enjoying this.. 
ANNE In order to restore his confidence, this French King spends a fortune on anything that glitters, on building of castles with large towers.. 
ANNE artfully gestures the phallic implications.. 
ANNE But these symbols of wealth and virility fail to convince. Talk among the ladies at court in France suggests.. A ANNE stops herself... 
HENRY What? 
ANNE That in this department too, the King has his shortcomings. 
ANNE's gesture, (discreetly wiggling her small finger). HENRY stares for a moment. A deathly silence. Has she gone too far?

Then HENRY smiles. Delighted. DOGS bark in bewilderment. Soon everyone in the room laughs too. 
xcept for the SEYMOURS, (SIR JOHN and his sons, EDWARD and THOMAS), who glower, mute, at the end of the table beside their sister JANE.. 
INT. MARY'S BEDROOM - DAY SIR THOMAS beams with excitement and satisfaction... 
SIR THOMAS You should have seen the Seymours! Their faces! 
MARY lies in bed. Sitting by her side is her father.. 
SIR THOMAS They must have thought that with you out of the way, they had a real opportunity with that pale-faced thing of theirs, Jane... 
SIR THOMAS smiles as he remembers.. 
SIR THOMAS (cont'd) But Anne put pay to that. Last night, the King only had eyes for us Boleyns. 
MARY shoots a private, knowing look..

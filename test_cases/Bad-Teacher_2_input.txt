ELIZABETH 
(TO HERSELF) You can bet on it. 
INT. DR. VOGEL'S OFFICE - RECEPTION AREA - DAY 
Danni, the receptionist, uncrumples a BALL OF CRUMPLED CASH and counts it. Elizabeth taps her fingers impatiently. 
DANNI Almost done. We don't normally deal with cash here. At the doctor's office. Elizabeth slides the bonus check across the desk. 
ELIZABETH And this is endorsed. And the rest you can put on these. Elizabeth slides four credit cards across the desk. The MIDDLE-AGED DOCTOR from earlier walks by. 
DANNI 
(TO ELIZABETH) And when would you like to come in? 
ELIZABETH 
(TO DOCTOR) 
MIDDLE-AGED DOCTOR Hi. He goes into his office. Elizabeth turns back to Danni. 
DANNI And when would you like to come in? 
ELIZABETH Today. Tomorrow. As soon as possible. Danni checks her calendar. 
DANNI A week from tomorrow, then? 
ELIZABETH Book it. Danni slides Elizabeth a packet of literature. 
DANNI We have a 48 hour cancellation policy. Anything after that, you'll be charged 50% the cost of the surgery -- unless there are extenuating circumstances. 
ELIZABETH I wouldn't miss it for the world. Elizabeth pulls her shirt away from her body and looks down at her breasts. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) So long, suckers. 
EXT. J.A.M.S. - TEACHER PARKING LOT - DAWN 
The lot is empty except for Elizabeth's car. 
INT. AMY'S CLASSROOM - DAY 
Elizabeth enters and pulls latex gloves from her bag. She snaps them on. She takes a seat at Amy's desk and pulls an apple from her bag. Then she pulls out POISON IVY. She rubs the apple with the poison ivy leaves and then carefully places it in the center of the desk. Elizabeth smiles. 
INT. AMY'S CLASSROOM - LATER 
Amy's class is seated. Amy enters and heads for her desk. She notices the apple and smiles at her class, touched. Thank you. The class stares back at her blankly. 
AMY (CONT'D) Who did this? No response from the class. 
AMY (CONT'D) Oh come on. Nobody wants an extra sticker on their all-star board? Amy presses the apple to her ear. 
AMY (CONT'D) (muppet voice, to apple) Who brought you to me? Amy places the apple up to her ear. 
AMY (CONT'D) 
(MUPPET VOICE) What's that, Mr. Apple? You want me to take a bite? Alrighty-roo. Amy takes a bite of the apple and then addresses the class. 
AMY (CONT'D) Enough horsin' around, let's get started. 
JUMP CUT TO:

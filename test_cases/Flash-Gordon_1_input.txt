INT. DUNGEON (FLASH'S VOICE) 
ZARKOV, BARIN and TIGER MAN lie in chains, heads cocked at SOUNDS of the facas outside. THUD of a body falling, brief silence, then sound of a KEY IN THE LOCK. 
The door opens itself. 
FLASH'S VOICE It's me! 
INT. NARROW VERTICAL SHAFT (BARIN, FLASH'S VOICE, ZARKOV) 
The Same one AURA and FLASH fell down originally. Now BARIN, ZARKOV, TIGER MAN and FLASH are inching their way UP it like mountain climbers doing a rock chimney; in. back-to-back pairs, feet pressed out against the shaft walls. What makes it look even stranger, half of the FLASH-BARIN twosome is INVISIBLE. Low conversation as they pant and struggle up the SHAFT: 
ZARKOV How do we get down to the plasma level? 
FLASH'S VOICE Anti-gravity shaft -- I got a guard to show me -- 
BARIN This won't be easy, Flash -- 
FLASH'S VOICE Nothing's easy on Mongo -- 
INT. PLASMA CAVERN (CONTROLLER, GUARD CAPTAIN) 
LIZARD MEN SLAVES work like mad, shoveling radioactive fuel into the seething mass. 
ON THE MEZZANINE 
CONTROLLERS are at consoles. Many GUARDS stand around. Everyone watches a big hanging dial. Its needle quivers with each flare-up from the inferno below, inches toward a RED SECTOR. 
GUARD CAPTAIN Faster! -- More fueld! 
CONTROLLER What's the hurry? 
CONTROLLER What's the hurry? 
GUARD CAPTAIN He wants to give Dale Arden the final destruction of Earth as a wedding present. 
CONTROLLERS twist the shock-knobs. 
Tortured SLAVES howl in agony. Some drop and are thrown into the fiery mass, others redouble their efforts. 
ON THE MEZZANINE 
The needle quivers upwards. MOVE OFF it to a slot-like window in back wall. There are EYES behind the glass. 
INT. CRAWLSPACE BEHIND THE MEZZANINE (BARIN, FLASH'S VOICE, TIGER MAN, ZARKOV) 
ZARKOV,BARIN and TIGER MAN crouch amidst WHIRRING ventilators, watching through the window. 
BARIN How's it look to yoU? 
ZARKOV Bad. Plasma's contracting into a critical mass. When that needle hits the red, Earth is finished. 
TIGER MAN Grrao! I'll charge down at them: 
ZARKOV and BARIN just look at him. TIGER MAN slumps out of his fighting stance. 
Low door at the back opens itself and INVISIBLE FLASH comes in. 
FLASH'S VOICE Cavern is sealed tight -- every door locked from the inside -- 
CU ZARKOV 
Hope drains from his expression. 
ZARKOV Let's face it, my friends -- without a miracle, we've lost.

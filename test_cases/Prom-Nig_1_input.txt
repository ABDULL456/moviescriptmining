HATIOND (after a pause) I've learned to live them.. Vivian seems worse this time. 
FAIRCHILD 
(NODS) The persistence of Vivian's trauma. I wonder if there isn't something more serious at work here? 
HAMOND Something more serious than her daughter's death? 
19 INT. OFFICE - DAY 19 
Vivian fidgets in her chair. She seems very small and vulnerable in the large, somber office. 
20 INT. CAR (MOVING) DAY 20 
Alex is seated opposite his father in the front seat. Kim is in back. Easy listening MUSIC PLAYS softly on the car RADIO. Alex fiddles with the tuning dial, searching for music more to his tastes. Lost in thought, Hammond does not see the young girl skipping through the pedestrian crossing. 
KIM 
(SCREAMS) Daddy! Hammond slams on the brakes, throwing Alex against the dashboard. 
21 EXT. STREET - DAY 21 
The CAR SCREECHES to a halt inches away from the terri- fied child who stands frozen in the middle of the crossing. After a moment, realizing she is safe, the girl giggles nervously and skips away. 
22 INT. CAR - DAY 22 
Hammond lets out a sigh and turns to his children. 
HAMMOND You all right? They both nod. Alex massages his wrist. Hammond slips the car into gear and cautiously continues driving. 
KIM You're worried about Mom? 
HALMOND I was... He is interrupted by DISCO MUSIC ON the RADIO. Play- ing with the tuning dial, Alex quickly tries to pass over the music. 
KIM Hey, keep that! Alex groans but does as she asks. 
ALEX Disco sucks! 
HAMZMOND 
(REPROVINGLY) Alex! 
(CONTINUED) 
22 CONTINUED: 22 
ALEX Sorry, Dad... (turns back to 
KIM) Disco bites it! 
HAMMOND 
(DRYLY) That's much better. The car pulls into the Winston High School parking lot. They pile out. 
23 EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY 23 
Hammond, Kim and Alex walk through the empty lot towards the school. Suddenly, we HEAR a loud GRATING SOUND coming from nearby. The sudden noise startles Kim and she huddles against her father. A seedy little middle-aged man with a stubble of gray beard appears from behind a row of bushes, brandishing a pair of electric hedge clippers.

JASON Did you want to tell me something, Adam? 
ADAM This is the girl! 
At that moment Ray, having overheard, comes to Jason's side. He smiles at Adam. 
RAY Excellent choice, Adam. 
Adam is sick with himself. 
Across the room Betty panics when she looks at her watch. 
BETTY Oh ... oh...I have to be somewhere. I promised a friend. 
She quickly shakes Sarah's and Nicki's hands saying, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry" and runs off like Cinderella. 
Adam turns and sees her running off out of his world. 
Chris Isaak's song "Except The New Girl" segues in over Connie Stevens and plays as Adam, Sarah and Nicki watch Betty disappear out the sound stage door. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  1612 HAVENHURST - STREET - DAY 
Chris Isaak song "Except The New Girl" continues. 
An idling cab sits waiting with back door open. 
CUT TO: 
COURTYARD - 1612 HAVENHURST DAY 
Chris Isaak song segues to the sounds of a blues saxophone. 
Betty and Rita come out of Aunt Ruth's apartment. Betty is laughing, pulling on Rita. 
BETTY C'mom. There's nothing to be afraid of. 
Across the courtyard CORNELL DUMONT, a strikingly handsome young black musician, is on his balcony playing the saxophone. He stops playing when he sees the girls. He stands and looks as if recognizing someone. 
CORNELL DUMONT Hey! 
Betty and Rita stop and look up, shielding their eyes from the sun. 
CORNELL DUMONT (cont'd) Hey, how's Sol? 
BETTY Sol? 
CORNELL DUMONT No ... not you... (to Rita) I'm sorry... I forget your name. 
RITA (almost inaudible) Rita. 
CORNELL DUMONT Yeah. Well, I haven't seen Sol lately. Tell him to come by the club. 
Rita nods ... biting her lip. Cornell smiles and picks up his sax. 
BETTY And what's your name? 
CORNELL DUMONT (big smile) Cornell Dumont. 
He begins to blow some sweet jazz that flows smooth as syrup.

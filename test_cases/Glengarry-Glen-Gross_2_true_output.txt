ROMA Yes. 
LINGK Mmmm... 
ROMA I don't know.  For me, I'm saying, what is is, it's probably not the orgasm.  Some broads, forearms on your neck, something her eyes did. There was a sound she made...or, me, lying, in the, I'll tell you: me lying in bed; the next day she brought me caf√© au lait.  She gives me a cigarette, my balls feel like concrete.  Eh?  What I'm saying, what is our life? (pause) It's looking forward or it's looking back.  And that's our life. That's it.  Where is the moment? (pause) And what is it that we're afraid of? Loss.  What else? (pause) The bank closes.  We get sick, my wife died on a plane, the stock market collapsed...the house burnt down...what of these happen...? None on 'em.  We worry anyway. What does this mean?  I'm not secure.  How can I be secure? (pause) Through amassing wealth beyond all measure?  No.  And what's beyond all measure?  That's a sickness. That's a trap.  There is no measure. Only greed.  How can we act? (MORE) 
ROMA (CONT'D) The right way, we would say, to deal with this: "There is a one-in- a-million chance that so and so will happen...Fuck it, it won't happen to me..." No.  We know that's not the right way I think. (pause) We say the correct way to deal with this is "There is a one-in-so-and- so chance this will happen...God protect me.  I am powerless, let it not happen to me..." But no to that. I say.  There's something else. What is it? "If it happens, AS IT MAY for that is not within our powers, I will deal with it, just as I do today with what draws my concern today." I say this is how we must act.  I do those things which seem correct to me today.  I trust myself.  And if security concerns me, I do that which today I think will make me secure.  And every day I do that, when that day arrives that I need a reserve, [a] odds are that I have it, and [b] the true reserve that I have is the strength that I have of acting each day without fear. (pause) According to the dictates of my mind. (pause) Stocks, bonds, objects of art, real estate.  Now: what are they? (pause) An opportunity.  To what?  To make money?  Perhaps.  To lose money? Perhaps.  To "indulge" and to "learn" about ourselves?  Perhaps. So fucking what?  What isn't? They're an opportunity.  That's all. They're an event.  A guy comes up to you, you make a call, you send in a brochure, it doesn't matter, "There're these properties I'd like for you to see." What does it mean? What you want it to mean. (MORE) 
ROMA (CONT'D) (pause) Money? (pause) If that's what it signifies to you. Security? (pause) Comfort? (pause) All it is is THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO YOU. (pause) That's all it is.  How are they different? (pause) Some poor newly married guy gets run down by a cab.  Some busboy wins the lottery. (pause) All it is, it's a carnival.  What's special...what draws us? (pause) We're all different. (pause) We're not the same. (pause) We are not the same. (pause) Hmmm. (pause, sighs) It's been a long day. (pause) What are you drinking? 
LINGK Gimlet. 
ROMA Well, let's have a couple more.  My name is Richard Roma, what's yours? 
LINGK Lingk.  James Lingk. 
ROMA James.  I'm glad to meet you. (they shake hands) I'm glad to meet you, James. (pause) I want to show you something. (pause) It might mean nothing to you...and it might not. (MORE) 
ROMA (CONT'D) I don't know.  I don't know anymore. (pause.  He takes out a small map and spreads it on a table) What is that?  Florida.  Glengarry Highlands.  Florida. "Florida. Bullshit." And maybe that's true; and that's what I said: but look here: what is this?  This is a piece of land.  Listen to what I'm going to tell you now: 
The real estate office.  Ransacked.  A broken plateglass window boarded up, glass all over the floor.  Aaronow and Williamson standing around, smoking. 
Pause. 
AARONOW People used to say that there are numbers of such magnitude that multiplying them by two made no difference. 
Pause. 
WILLIAMSON Who used to say that? 
AARONOW In school. 
Pause.  Baylen, a detective, comes out of the inner office. 
BAYLEN Alright...? 
Roma enters from the street. 
ROMA Williamson...Williamson, they stole the contracts...? 
BAYLEN Excuse me, sir... 
ROMA Did they get my contracts? 
WILLIAMSON They got... 
BAYLEN Excuse me, fella. 
ROMA ...did they... 
BAYLEN Would you excuse us, please...? 
ROMA Don't fuck with me, fella.  I'm talking about a fuckin' Cadillac car that you owe me...

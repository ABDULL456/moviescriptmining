HARRY 
Okay. 
ERICA 
I mean, if you had an opinion, I'd be curious but...' 
HARRY 
will you tell me first why you only miss being married at night? 
ERICA 
(cracking eggs) Oh, 'cause the phone doesn't ring as much at night and the "alone" thing happens at night and sleeping by myself took some getting used to. But I got the hang of it. You gotta sleep in the middle of the bed. It's absolutely not healthy to have a side when no one has the other side. She starts mixing the batter. 
HARRY 
Okay, now I'm convinced what I think of you is right. (Erica waits. . . ) You are a tower of strength. 
ERICA 
(shoulders sagging) Ughhhhhhhhhh... . 
HARRY 
Try not to rate my answer. 
ERICA 
I'm sorry. It's just...I'm sorry. 
HARRY 
You're like a thoroughbred in a world of mutts. No, you know what you are, you're like a great portrait over a fireplace. Words have been invented to describe women like you. 
ERICA 
( fearful) Such as? 
HARRY 
Flinty   and...Impervious. 
ERICA 
So you think I'm inhuman. 
HARRY 
No. I think you're formidable. 
ERICA 
But cold and distant. Like I'm frozen in some painting... 
HARRY 
Not at all. I think you're strength defines you. (sees how sensitive she is) But it's thrilling when your defenses are down arid you're not isolated. That, I believe, is your winning combo. A killer combo actually. 
ERICA 
... So I can't decide if you hate me or if maybe you're the only person who ever got me. 
HARRY 
I don't hate you. The moment is broken when they HEAR the FRONT DOOR OPEN and 
HIGH HEELS APPROACHING. 
ERICA 
Hello? Marin ARRIVES IN THE DOORWAY in a knockout of a dress holding a bag from Zabars. She looks fresh, vibrant, sexy. 
MARIN 
Room service! 
ERICA 
What are you doing here at this hour? 
Erica and Harry have the air of kids caught making out by one of their parents. Harry straightens out his pajamas, smooths down his hair. Erica catches all this. 
MARIN 
(enters, kisses Erica) 
I 
had this big photography auction tonight, then I went out with a bunch of people, I checked my messages and got this so sad message from Harry so bored out here. I thought I should come out and at least see how he was doing. (kisses Harry on the cheek) Thank you for the gorgeous flowers by the way. They were so huge... Erica nods to herself. Oh, God, he sends them all flowers. Harry notes Erica's reaction. 
MARIN 
So how are you guys? (sets down the Zabar's bag) Oh, this is too sweet. You're making pancakes? Awwww. And you're both in your pj's. Now I feel I'm interrupting. 
ERICA 
Don't be silly. You know I never sleep and this one doesn't sleep either. It's... .What's in the bag? 
MARIN 
(reaches into the bag) A quart of matzoh ball soup for Harry. I know it's not the remedy for heart problems but it is low cholesterol. 
ERICA 
(hating to correct her) But high sodium. 
MARIN 
Oh, sorry. Stupid. For Mom, your favorite raisin-bread. And for me... (reaches into the bag) My favorite Vodka. Marin's cell phone RINGS. 
MARIN 
(into phone) Hello? No I'm here, babe. Made record time. Everyone's still there? Erica feeling suddenly frumpy, fixes her hair. Harry watches her. She catches him and shrugs. Marin flips her phone shut and tosses it in her purse. 
ERICA 
So, Mar, now that you're here, why don't you finish the pancakes and I'll get back to work... 
MARIN 
Mom! I just got here, hold on. She pours a healthy Vodka into a glass, grabs some ice. 
MARIN 
So your ex-husband stood me up today. We were supposed to have lunch at Barneys . He never showed up. Was he always like this? 
ERICA 
Honey, I don't know... 
MARIN 
This is what happens after a couple gets divorced, the kid inherits all the problems. Not that I'm a kid. (then to Harry, the flirt in her coming back) So how are you, how do you feel? When can you go home? Just as harry is about to answer, Marin's cell RINGS. She picks it up, looks at her caller ID, throws it back in her bag. 
ERICA

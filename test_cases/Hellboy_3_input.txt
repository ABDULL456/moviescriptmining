LIZ What -- ? 
MYERS That you feel that way about me. 
LIZ You want to know -- Now -- ? Here? Red, white, whatever -- Guys are all the same. 
INT. TUNNEL "C" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - STEEP SLOPE - DAY 
Hellboy labors up a steep slope, using rocks and roots for handholds. He reaches a dead end and collapses, out of breath. 
Light filters through a crack in the ground; he can faintly hear Liz and Myers. 
INT. TUNNEL "B" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - CAVERN AREA - DAY 
Liz and Myers reach a wider section of Tunnel "B". They find themselves calf-deep in brown water. 
Myers lights Liz's path as she steps onto a large stone. 
MYERS Watch out. It's slippery... 
His light shorts out. She shines her light past him. 
LIZ Oh, my God... 
Myers turns. His flashlight comes back on, revealing a complex natural cavern. An entire WALL IS COVERED with translucent eggs. 
SAMMAEL is there, gnawing on a dry arm bone, with the hand still attached. When the light hits his face, his milky pupils constrict. A snarl... 
A SECOND SAMMAEL emerges from the water. It shakes itself off. A THIRD ONE raise its head. 
Myers and Liz try to back away, but a metal wall rises right behind them KLANKKKKK!!! They are trapped!! 
Myers goes to grab a set of explosive belts. Tries to set up the timer. Zipp! -- one Sammael snatches them away. Myers falls to the ground, clothes torn, injured. 
LIZ (into the radio) Marco, Marco, Marco... Get your Big Red butt over here! 
Something stomps on the ceiling directly above them. Again and again. 
INT. TUNNEL "C" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL FLOOR - DAY 
Hellboy pounds the floor with his rock hand. Furiously. 
HELLBOY Hang on kid, I'm coming for you!! 
The rocks below him start to crumble. 
EXT. ANTHILL VIEW OF UNDERGROUND TUNNELS AND PITS - DAY 
In an "ANT FARM" view of the complex, we see Hellboy above, pummeling and -- in the cavern below -- Liz and Myers. 
INT. TUNNEL "B" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL CAVERN AREA - DAY 
Dust and rocks fall from above. The four identical creatures move in on Liz and Myers. Myers shoots one in the head three times. The creature shakes off the hits as if pelted with pebbles. 
One of them springs. As it flies through the air, Hellboy crashes through the ceiling. He lands on top of it along with a ton or two of stone. The creature is crushed. 
Two eggs glow, metamorphosing. Presto -- two new Sammaels are born. The first two Sammaels growl, joined by the two new ones. Liz sprints to safety. 
HELLBOY Sorry. Just couldn't leave you two alone. 
Hellboy scoops up Myers and deposits him next to Liz. 
Lit by Myers' flashlight, two of the creatures jump. One clamps onto Hellboy's back, the other onto his leg. Hellboy howls. The third one joins in, like lions dragging down a zebra. This time, though, the zebra fights back. 
Hellboy pulls out his gun and fires a round into the chest of a Sammael. Two eggs glow -- two new Sammaels are born. They're FIVE. 
Hellboy's torso is covered in blood. He falls to the ground. A fourth and a fifth creature spring onto him, biting. Hellboy is in trouble. 
Liz watches and shivers. A ripple of heat shimmers over her body. 
LIZ (at Myers) Hit me. 
MYERS What? 
Liz is desperate, crying. 
LIZ Hit me -- (beat) All of my life I've run away from it... Now I want it to happen! Do it. 
Hellboy screams. Water explodes under the fighting bodies. Two of the Sammaels turn their attention to Liz and Myers. 
MYERS I can't, I -- 
Liz slaps him. 
LIZ I know now: I love him. I've always loved him. 
A beat of silence, then Myers slaps her across the face, once. Hard. The heat ripple builds. The air vibrates around her. Her pupils kick back light, like an animal's. 
LIZ Go now.

{"train": "MILK \nWritten by \nDustin Lance Black \nFADE IN: \n1 INT. HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT - 1978 \nClose on a finger pressing the \"record\" button of a circa 1970's tape recorder. \nHARVEY MILK (V.O.) This is Harvey Milk speaking on Friday November 18th. This is to be played only in the event of my death by assassination... REVEAL: HARVEY MILK, 48, sitting at his kitchen table in a cluttered San Francisco apartment. \nHARVEY MILK (CONT'D) During one of the early campaigns, I started opening my speeches with the same line and it sort of became my signature... \n2 EXT. CITY HALL - NIGHT \nIn street clothes, trying to corral an angry mob on City Hall's steps, Harvey lifts a bullhorn. \nHARVEY MILK Hello, I'm Harvey Milk, and I'm here to recruit you. \n3 INT. HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT \nHarvey at his kitchen table making his recording... \nHARVEY MILK If I was speaking to a slightly hostile or mostly straight audience, I'd try to break the tension with a joke... \n4 INT. UNION HALL - NIGHT \nHarvey is in a plain, ill fitting brown suit making a CAMPAIGN SPEECH to a crowd of stone faced UNION BOYS. \nHARVEY MILK I know, I know, I'm not what you were expecting, but I left my high heels at home. Harvey gets a LAUGH from the AUDIENCE. \n5 INT. HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT \nRETURN TO: Harvey speaking into his tape recorder. \nHARVEY MILK I fully realize that a person who stands for what I stand for - an activist, a gay activist - becomes the target or potential target for a person who is insecure, terrified, afraid or very disturbed themselves... \n6 INT. CITY HALL OFFICES - MONTAGE - DAY \nPOLICE OFFICERS AND PRESS RACE THROUGH THE HALLS of City Hall, their walkie-talkies squawking. Something terrible has happened. It's chaos. A STRETCHER IS WHEELED OUT OF AN OFFICE. On it, a FILLED BODY BAG with a WHITE SHEET draped over it. The press rush to get a shot. The police officers quickly load the body onto the elevator and disappear from sight. \n9 EXT. S.F. CITY HALL / FRONT STEPS - DAY \nA shell shocked DIANNE FEINSTEIN, 45, wades into a throng of REPORTERS. Those surrounding her try to quiet the crowd. \nDIANNE FEINSTEIN As President of the Board of Supervisors, it's my duty to make this announcement. Both Mayor Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk have been shot... and killed. GASPS from the REPORTERS. Dianne struggles to be heard. \nDIANNE FEINSTEIN (CONT'D) Police are looking for a suspect... Supervisor Dan White. \n10 INT. ST. MARY'S CATHEDRAL - DAY \nThe very picture of loveliness, MARY-ANN WHITE, 28, finds her husband DAN WHITE, 31, sitting in the pews praying. He's a handsome, devout, all-American man in a three-piece suit. She sits by him. A weight hangs. He can't make eye contact. \nDAN WHITE Something has happened. \nShe puts her arm around him, feels a gun at his side. She holds him, firmly gripping the revolver in his holster, to conceal, to keep him from using it, potentially on himself. \nSCOTT SMITH Are you on uppers or what? \nHARVEY MILK No. This is just... plain old me. \nSCOTT SMITH You're afraid of the cops? \nHARVEY MILK I'm just discreet. I know a lot of people here. If they found out, I could lose my job. \nSCOTT SMITH (meaning a closet case) Oh. You're one of \"those.\" (examines Harvey's eyes) I think you need a change of scenery. New friends. \nHARVEY MILK I need a change. \nSCOTT SMITH (looks at the clock) You're forty now. \nHARVEY MILK (just the truth) Forty years old and I haven't done a thing I'm proud of. \nSCOTT SMITH (re: the desert tray) You keep eating like this and you'll be a fat ass by fifty. \nHARVEY MILK (laughs it off) No. Don't you worry. I won't make it to fifty. Scott distracts him, playful, like a newlywed at a wedding, he rubs a slice of pie in Harvey's face. Harvey reacts. Wipes the pie from his eye, and tackles his young, frisky new lover. They kiss. The mess getting everywhere. Harvey brushes it out of Scott's hair. \nHARVEY MILK (CONT'D) (an idea, half-jokingly, \nHALF-SERIOUSLY) Why don't we run away together? \nSCOTT SMITH Where to? \n16 INT. FLASH FORWARD - HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT \nRETURN TO: Harvey speaks to the tape recorder. (Throughout the film, these scenes should feel intimate, as if Harvey is telling us things no one else knows.) \nHARVEY MILK In those days, San Francisco was the place where everyone wanted to go... To drop out... To fall in love... \n16A INT. DODGE CHARGER - MONTAGE - (1972) \n8MM HOME MOVIE MONTAGE of Harvey and Scott DRESSED FULL-OUT LIKE HIPPIES, long hair, beard, beads, sunglasses, driving \nthrough the redwoods, over the Golden Gate Bridge, and into San Francisco. \nHARVEY MILK (V.O.) But by 1972, The Haight was boarded up. Crime-filled. Drug-filled. The new place for us refugees was this run down Irish Catholic neighborhood in Eureka Valley. Six blocks square... The Castro. \n17 EXT. CASTRO STREET - DAY \nHarvey lifts a Nikon camera and starts SNAPPING PHOTOS of Castro Street. \nWE SEE WHAT HARVEY SEES THROUGH THE LENS: A HARDWARE STORE, a LIQUOR STORE, empty buildings, boarded windows... Harvey points the camera toward The MARQUEE of the Castro Theater, big letters spelling out... \"C A S T R O...\" Harvey points his camera across the street at the gray- haired, OWNER of a liquor store. Harvey snaps PHOTOS of his face, an expression of distrust. Harvey SNAPS a SIGN in the liquor shop window that reads: \n\"EUREKA VALLEY MERCHANTS SOCIETY.\" Harvey's CAMERA focuses on TWO CUTE, YOUNG, HIPPIE BOYS WALKING PAST, one puts his arm over the other. To Harvey's eyes it's a very new site. It's overt. Thrilling. Harvey snaps a photo of an empty storefront with a FOR RENT SIGN hanging out front. \n19 INT. HARVEY'S AND SCOTT'S EMPTY APARTMENT - DAY \nThe place is FILLED with OPERA MUSIC from a record player. Harvey is loading a roll of film into his camera. Scott is getting high, lying in the sun that pours through the large, empty windows. \nSCOTT SMITH I cashed my last unemployment check yesterday... \nHARVEY MILK Well, I hope you did something useful with it. \nSCOTT SMITH I bought an ounce of pot. I was just wondering if you had any \n(MORE) \nHARVEY MILK We should have at least one block in one city right? Start there and take over the neighborhood. (a smile) Okay, you can come in now! Scott heads toward the kitchen. The table is LAID OUT with a home-cooked meal, CANDLES and a huge bouquet of FLOWERS. \nSCOTT SMITH Wow. This is-- \nHarvey SMASHES A CREAM PIE into Scott's face. Payback. \nHARVEY MILK Happy birthday! Scott chases Harvey around the apartment, trying to smear some of the CREAM PIE onto him. \n22 EXT. THE CASTRO - DAY \nThe street is shut down for the first ever Castro Street Fair. The crowd is mostly gay, the majority congregate outside Toad Hall bar. ANGLE ON: SOME OF THE OLD-SCHOOL, IRISH LOCALS milling about, eyeing the scene skeptically. Harvey MOVES THROUGH THE CROWD with Scott, shaking hands. \nMAN ON THE STREET Thanks for the party, Mr. Milk! \nHARVEY MILK Thanks for joining the Castro Village Association! Harvey arrives at A LONG LINE OF GAY MEN winding out of the Irish liquor store (from earlier). He squeezes past them, into the store, leaving Scott outside. \nHARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Excuse me gentleman... ladies. (finding the shop owner) Hello! Mr. McConnelly! McConnelly, at the register, is overwhelmed with all the new business. \nHARVEY MILK (CONT'D) I just wanted to stop in and see how business was doing. \nMCCONNELLY Fine. \nHARVEY MILK So you don't mind all these homosexuals in here, do you? McConnelly grins, uncomfortable. The line of gay men is curious about the hubbub. Point made, Harvey does a 180. \nHARVEY MILK (CONT'D) No. No. Just a joke. Mr. McConnelly here loves our kind. Spend away! (to McConnelly) Tell your wife Hello for me. Harvey spots Scott in the crowd and PULLS HIM TOWARD HIM, KISSING HIM ON THE MOUTH. It's quite the show. They step back out onto the street where an Irish band is now playing. Gay men watch. Some clap. Harvey grabs Scott and spins him through a sharp waltz. OFF the pair at home in their new neighborhood. \n23 INT. FLASH FORWARD - HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT \nHARVEY MILK And people started hanging around our store. Not customers. Activists, kids, folks who needed a home away from home... \n26 EXT. CASTRO CAMERA - INTERCUT \nA NEW sign goes in the window: \"We are VERY open.\" \n27 INT. CASTRO CAMERA SHOP - DAY \nA FEW YOUNG MEN are hanging out in the shop, the beginnings of Harvey's entourage. Harvey moves among them, sharing a clipped Sunday cartoon, lecturing them on politics or the arts, and checking out the cute ones. \nHARVEY MILK (V.O.) There was Danny Niccoletta, a cute art student who I'd picked up at Toad Hall. Turns out he was also good at running the Camera Shop... something Scott and I found we had surprising little interest in... ON DANNY NICCOLETTA, young, waif-like, somewhat helpless. \nDANNY NICCOLETTA Opera is passe, Harvey. It's about street theater, now. \nHARVEY MILK What you're not getting is the spectacle of it, the bigger than life emotions... Danny jumps up and IMITATES the LARGER THAN LIFE GESTURES of an opera diva, making Harvey laugh. \nHARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) Jim Rivaldo. A great mind. A great wit. A Harvard graduate, which nobody cared about, in those days, in the Castro... including himself. JIM RIVALDO flops down into the vintage dental chair that sits in front of Harvey's desk. He seems to be looking for something to occupy his keen mind. A sharply dressed young man, 20s, DICK PABICH, walks up to peek over his shoulder. \nHARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) And somewhere along the line Jim picked up a protege, a cute political kid from Wisconsin... Dick Pabich... And of course there was Dennis Peron, who ran a very popular business with the new kids... DENNIS PERON hands Scott a FREE JOINT. \nHARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) And on occasion we actually had a real customer. But only occasionally. ACROSS THE ROOM, Scott is waiting on a CUSTOMER, he's out of place: straight, gruff, a union man, ALLAN BAIRD, 40s. \nSCOTT SMITH Harvey... This guy wants to talk to you. \nHARVEY MILK (approaches Allan) Welcome. What can we do for you? \nALLAN BAIRD Hi, I'm Allan Baird. Teamsters representative, and Director of the Coors beer boycott in California. \nHARVEY MILK Everyone, this is Allan Baird. He's a very big deal, so behave yourselves. \nALLAN BAIRD I was told you were like the Mayor of the Castro, said you organized the CVA, you might know some people in the bars. \nSCOTT SMITH I'm beat, Harvey. I passed out flyers for seven hours straight. \nHARVEY MILK In the bathhouse? \nSCOTT SMITH (giving it right back) People in bathhouses vote. I'm tired. I'm taking a nap. Scott heads up the stairs to their apartment. A CUSTOMER comes in. Danny quickly gathers the REVEALING PHOTOS and puts them back in the envelope. \nHARVEY MILK Just checking the exposure. That a new boyfriend? He's very cute. \nCUSTOMER (taking the photos, embarrassed) Um... Thanks, Harvey. \nHARVEY MILK (to Jim) So who are these so-called \"gay leaders?\" And who appointed them? And what are you suggesting, Jim, that I'm supposed to go and solicit their endorsement? PAST HARVEY WE SEE A GRANDMOTHERLY VOLUNTEER, THELMA, opening the mail, casually reading a letter, then rising and approaching Harvey. \nTHELMA \nHARVEY-- \nHARVEY MILK We're down here, on the streets, trying to help people, so where they hell are they? \nDICK PABICH David Goodstein is the publisher of The Advocate and he has a house-- \nJIM RIVALDO A mansion-- \nDICK PABICH --in Atherton. \nTHELMA (clearly shaken) Harvey, you should read this. CLOSE ON THE LETTER as it goes from Thelma to Harvey. \n37 INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT / KITCHEN - LATER \nScott reads the LETTER. Harvey sits VERY STILL. \nSCOTT SMITH \"Harvey Milk will have a dream journey and nightmare to hell, a night of horror. You will be stabbed and have your genitals, cock, balls, prick cut off.\" \n(MORE) \nSCOTT SMITH (CONT'D) \n(BEAT) I'm calling the police. \nHARVEY MILK They probably wrote it. (off Scott's anxiety) Hey, If somebody tries to kill me, I'll get the sympathy vote, right? Could be just the push we need. \nSCOTT SMITH You think this is funny? Look at it. Reluctantly, Harvey takes the letter from Scott. \nHARVEY MILK It's a complete joke. No rhythm. No humor. It's insulting. CLOSE ON THE LETTER: Someone has drawn a STICK FIGURE of Harvey being tortured - bullets, knives, fire, etc. Harvey makes a DECISION: He sticks the DRAWING to the refrigerator, the first thing he'll see in the morning. \nSCOTT SMITH Don't do that. \nHARVEY MILK If you put it away, hide it in a drawer, it'll just get bigger and scarier. Now it's there. We'll see it every day. It can't get us. \nSCOTT SMITH All this energy... to make yourself a target. And what for? Something we have no chance to win. Harvey wraps his arms around him. \nHARVEY MILK I keep telling you, it's not just about winning. \n38 EXT. DAVID GOODSTEIN'S MANSION - DAY \nHarvey, in his work boots and jeans, watches as a LARGE GATE SLIDES OPEN allowing his entry. Scott, even scruffier looking than Harvey, stands next to him. \nHARVEY MILK (V.O.) The \"top gays\" in San Francisco were David Goodstein and his lawyer sidekick Rick Stokes. David was a \n(MORE) \nSCOTT SMITH No. Not cute. The shoes are hideous and I hate your hair. You're not fooling anybody. \nHARVEY MILK I'm not gonna let the Pacific Heights biddies write me off again because of a ponytail. I like it. Scott is horrified. Harvey pulls a pair of movie ticket stubs from its inner pocket. \nHARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Cabaret? For two? Lily, is this from one of my kind? \nLILY No, no. You won't run into the owner. He died in that suit. \nSCOTT SMITH This isn't sexy, Harvey. Harvey grabs Scott, kisses him. Then playful: \nHARVEY MILK Too bad. No more pot, no more bath houses for me and little poo. \n44 INT/EXT. CASTRO CAMERA - DAY \nMONTAGE: More ACTIVITY inside and outside the shop. More VOLUNTEERS. The printing press burns through flyers. \nHARVEY MILK (V.O.) We ran and we lost the Supervisors race a second time in '75, but with \n(MORE) \nHARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) more votes than ever. So in 1976, against everyone's advice, I really pissed off the Democratic political power houses, because I ran against \"their boy\"-- \nA SIGN GOES IN THE SHOP WINDOW \"HARVEY MILK VS. THE MACHINE.\" \nHARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) --Art Agnos, a part of their \"Political Machine.\" And this time we weren't running for City Supervisor. This time it was bigger, California State Assembly. \n50 INT. HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW / CANDIDATE DEBATE - NIGHT \nIt's a firestorm of words as Harvey debates Art Agnos. \nHARVEY MILK It's a racket. It's 1976 and you still have to be straight, white, Catholic and male to get into the San Francisco police force. It's Racist. Homophobic. \nART AGNOS How many people do you consider enemies, Harvey? I've counted five already. Art smiles. Chuckles flutter through the audience. \nHARVEY MILK You're right, Art. And many are your closest friends. You see, I don't think State Assembly seats should be awarded on the basis of service to the Democrat Machine. Machines operate on oil and grease. They're dirty, dehumanizing, and too often unresponsive to any needs but those of the operator. \nART AGNOS Mr. Milk, I've worked for years as a social worker in this city. I know Sacramento. I know how to get done what we all need done there. \nHARVEY MILK Tell me Mr. Agnos... right here in the Castro, Robert Hillsbourough was murdered for walking home with his long time partner. Stabbed, \n(MORE) \nHARVEY MILK (CONT'D) fifteen times. The last words he heard were \"Faggot, Faggot, Faggot...\" And you say you're outraged, but why won't your liberal establishment return our calls? Why won't they bring these murderers to justice? \n51 EXT. HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW - LATER \nArt Agnos puts his arm around Harvey as they walk out. \nART AGNOS You know Harv', your whole rap's a real downer. \nHARVEY MILK My God, you're handsome up close. I can't tell you how much I'm looking forward to licking you... in the polls. \nART AGNOS \n(LAUGHS) You talk a lot about what you're against. What are you for? In this town, you gotta give em' a reason for optimism or you're cooked. Art gets into his car and goes. Harvey has no car. He stops and PONDERS ART'S WORDS... They stick with him. \n51A INT. HARVEY'S AND SCOTT'S APARTMENT - EVENING \nScott tries to make a simple meal of pasta, struggling to operate in the kitchen that is filled with Harvey's POLITICAL ENTOURAGE and VOLUNTEERS. He finds Harvey, Jim, and Dick having an impromptu strategy meeting in the adjoining bedroom. \nHARVEY MILK Maybe a little. Or not. \nCLEVE JONES I went to Spain last month... long story. In Barcelona, there was this memorial march for gay people who died under Franco. The police tried to break it up. It started a riot. A bullet ripped through a drag queens scalp, his wig flew off, but he kept fighting. There was blood literally running in the gutter. \nHARVEY MILK We could have a revolution here too. But you can't just use the Castro to cruise. You gotta fight. \nCLEVE JONES You think you'll win? \nHARVEY MILK Winning isn't my strong suit. \nCLEVE JONES \n(BRAVADO) Well, I don't \"do\" losing. Ever. Maybe I should run for office, and you can work for me. (off Harvey's laugh) If you can do it, I can do it. \nHARVEY MILK Can you assemble a thousand people in an hour? \nCLEVE JONES Yeah, sure. \nHARVEY MILK All right, if I run again, you're my man. \nCLEVE JONES If...? \nHARVEY MILK Polls open in 3 hours. Lets hit the bus stops. \n54 EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - DAY \nHarvey is on the back of a motorcycle. The driver heads up Market Street. Folks stand in voting lines, flags outside of polling places. City Hall's tall dome grows nearer. \nHARVEY MILK (V.O.) And we lost that Assembly Race too, which made me a bona fide three- time, political loser. \n55 INT. CASTRO CAMERA - NIGHT \nCLOSE ON THE TV SET PLAYING A 1970's ORANGE JUICE COMMERCIAL featuring runner up to Miss America, ANITA BRYANT. \nANITA BRYANT (SINGING ON TV) \"Come to the Florida sunshine tree, great tasting orange juice naturally, orange juice with lots of vitamin c, from the Florida sunshine tree.\" Harvey is alone in the shop, surrounded by remnants of a celebration party that never happened. Jim Rivaldo lets himself into the store. Jim has his maps rolled up under his arm. \nJIM RIVALDO (trying to cheer up Harvey) We lost, but we lost by less! More votes than ever... (Harvey fake grins) I remember when that used to work. I want to show you something. This is remarkable. Jim starts laying out his trusty MAPS, color coded with precinct results from that night. \nJIM RIVALDO (CONT'D) The red is where you did best tonight. If we can get the initiative on district elections to pass, and we can -- we can -- our new Supervisor's District will go right up Market. Right around the Castro. \nThe district Jim outlines is ALL BRIGHT RED. \nJIM RIVALDO (CONT'D) If you run for Supervisor with this new district, it's a potential landslide. You'll be the first up- front gay man elected to major office in the U.S. \nHARVEY MILK I don't know if I have another one in me. Or Scott. But Harvey's gaze deceives his words. HOLD ON HARVEY - contemplating a FOURTH run for office. \n56 INT. CASTRO CAMERA - EVENING \nThe GROUP gathers around the TV WHICH SHOWS NATIONWIDE NEWS CLIPS OF ANITA BRYANT celebrating her election victory in Florida (overturning a pro-gay statute). A CHYRON READS: \"Landslide defeat for Florida Gay Rights Law.\" \nANITA BRYANT (ON TV) Tonight the laws of God and the cultural values of man have been vindicated. The people of Dade county, the normal majority, have said enough, enough, enough. \n57 INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - THE SAME NIGHT \nON THE TV: A REPORT ABOUT ANITA BRYANT'S VICTORY IN FLORIDA. \nTV REPORTER Gays in Florida can now be removed from their jobs and prosecuted if their \"deviant\" lifestyles are uncovered. HARVEY'S POV OUT A WINDOW: FURIOUS GAYS pour out of the bars BLOWING WHISTLES, raising TRASH CANS... It might turn into a \nRIOT. \nHARVEY MILK Give me permission to march them. \nPOLICEMAN Where? \nHARVEY MILK Anywhere. \n60 EXT. CASTRO AND MARKET STREET - MOMENTS LATER \nSurrounded by the massive crowd, HARVEY CLIMBS THE LARGE BOX that covers the subway construction at Market and Castro. It's a stage of sorts. Harvey lifts his bullhorn to his lips. \nHARVEY MILK I know you are angry. I am angry. Follow me through the streets of San Francisco to share our anger! Harvey jumps down and begins walking, not sure if the mob will follow. Finally, they do. Cleve catches up. \nHARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Are they following in back? \nCLEVE JONES Yes. Where are we going? \nHARVEY MILK I don't know. (off Cleve's concern) We have to keep them moving. Exhaust them. March them till they drop. We can't have a riot tonight. Harvey LIFTS THE BULLHORN. He starts a marching chant. The crowd starts following along. JUMP TO: Gays glare at cops. Cops beat their nightsticks against their chests and power poles. Anger burns as Harvey marches the mob toward City Hall. Dick and Jim catch up. \nDICK PABICH They're still too hot in back. They'll burn the joint down. \nHARVEY MILK Help me turn them up Van Ness. We'll go all the way to Broadway. \nDick heads back to try and wrangle the crowd. Harvey continues marching. \n61 EXT. CITY HALL - LATER THAT NIGHT \nHarvey arrives, the crowd still hot. Cops beat their nightsticks against their shields. Some jab protesters, trying to incite a fight. Anger burns. Harvey climbs the steps, his stage. He lifts his bullhorn. \nHARVEY MILK My name is Harvey Milk... And I want to recruit you. The CROWD ROARS APPROVAL. \nHARVEY MILK (CONT'D) I am here tonight to say, we will no longer sit quietly in our closets. We must fight. Not just in the Castro, or San Francisco, but everywhere the Anitas go. Anita Bryant did not win tonight. Anita Bryant has brought us together... She is going to create a national gay force! (The crowd ROARS) And the young people in Richmond, Minnesota, or Jackson, Mississippi, or Woodmere, New York... Who are coming out and hearing Anita Bryant on television telling them that they're wrong, they're sick, that there is no place for them in this great country, in this world... They're looking to us for something tonight... (his big moment, realizing his true mission) And I say, we have to give them hope! The CROWD goes WILD. HARVEY'S SPEECH CROSSES THE CUT TO... \n63 INT. COMMUNITY CENTER - NIGHT \nHarvey speaks to the \"PARENT-TEACHERS UNITED FOR BETTER SCHOOLS\" group. \nHARVEY MILK (V.O.) --Hope for a better world... Hope for a better tomorrow... Hope for a \n(MORE) \nHARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) better place to come to if the pressures at home are too great... \n64 INT. UNION HALL - NIGHT \nHarvey speaks to a hall filled with TEAMSTERS. \nHARVEY MILK Hope for the worker who awakens from the American dream to find that all the jobs have left the country... We gotta give em' HOPE! PAN FACES OF TEAMSTERS - Several MINORITY FACES. CLOSE ON \nALLAN BAIRD (UNION LEADER OF THE COORS BEER BOYCOTT). HE \nSTARTS TO APPLAUD. OTHERS JOIN IN. \nHARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) (pre-lap, an intimate tone) When San Francisco changed the voting rules-- \n65 INT. FLASH FORWARD - HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT \nHarvey is still speaking into the tape recorder... \nHARVEY MILK --they allowed people to elect Supervisors directly from their own neighborhoods. A black neighborhood could elect an African- American. Chinatown could elect a Chinese Supervisor... And the Castro could choose me or Rick Stokes. But decent art begs for balance, right? So little district 8, two miles south of The Castro-- \nDICK PABICH You replaced Scott with a lesbian? \nHARVEY MILK Anne worked on a recycling campaign up North. She's very organized. \nJIM RIVALDO How do you know she's not a plant from Rick Stokes' campaign? \nANNE KRONENBERG Are you guys always this paranoid? \nMICHAEL WONG Yes. They take after Harvey. \nHARVEY MILK Shouldn't you be doing someone's laundry? \nMICHAEL WONG Right after you redecorate my house. \nANNE KRONENBERG (pointed at Jim Rivaldo) Sir, my girlfriends say you guys don't like women. Just asking, is there a place for us in all this, or are you scared of girls? \nHARVEY MILK Gentleman, we already have a tinker bell, a lotus-blossom, Jim and Dick in your three-piece suits. We need someone to manage things. A woman this time. She's the right price, and she has bigger balls than any of you. \nANNE KRONENBERG Just give me whatever's left over in the register at the end of the day. So should I call the Chronicle about getting US an endorsement? No? OFF the group of misfits, considering the addition. \n69B INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE A LECTURE HALL - NIGHT \nPAN OFF: a large \"RICK STOKES, SUPERVISOR DISTRICT 5\" poster to reveal Anne Kronenberg outside the hall handing \"MILK\" signs to a long line of gathering women and lesbians who are filing in. Flanked by a PEEVED AID, Rick Stokes rushes out of the lecture hall and confronts Anne. \nRICK STOKES Young lady, you must be confused. This is my night, not Mr. Milk's. \nANNE KRONENBERG (as pleasant as can be) No, sir. I'm Harvey's new campaign manager. Anne Kronenberg. \nRICK STOKES Then you should know this race is for District 5, the Castro, not for all of your lesbian... compadres-- A tough lesbian kisses Anne and stares Rick down as she heads in. Rick looks uncomfortable around all these women. \nANNE KRONENBERG I'm sorry. Are we distracting you, Mr. Stokes? I'd hate to screw you up on your big night. Dick runs up looking for more fliers. Taking Rick even more off his game, Dick is flirtatious. \nDICK PABICH Hi Rick, handsome suit. Annie, do you have any more hand cards? \nRICK STOKES These people are not from this area. They need to leave. Now. \nDICK PABICH Not true. Guess where we found them all, Rick? A slew of them. Way up on Valencia Street. Living right there in our district. And you see, as it turns out, Annie here is very, very popular with the ladies. Dick puts his arm around Anne. Rick is stupefied. \n70 EXT. SF STREET - DAY \nDozens of supporters hold \"MILK for Supervisor\" signs in a long line along Market St. waving to commuters. Anne walks the long line, handing out new signs to arriving volunteers. Harvey is handing out FLYERS. He is exhausted, his throat is RAW. The campaign is nearly over. A WEIRD MOMENT: A BOY walks up to Harvey and hands him a flier. ALL SOUND GOES DEAD ON THE SOUNDTRACK as HARVEY'S EYES lock into the BOY'S EYES. Harvey reads the FLIER: \u00e2\u0080\u009cUnite and Fight for Dan White.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Harvey looks back to pat the BOY'S head, but he's gone. He looks to the sidewalk for the kid... a parent... nothing... \n71 INT. CASTRO CAMERA - NIGHT \nHarvey is still looking at the flier. Anne is leaving with a stack of SF Chronicles. Cleve comes in, pulls one off her stack, and looks for \"the article.\" \nHARVEY MILK They've accused me of many things, but never as blatant a lie as this. \nANNE KRONENBERG First ever newspaper endorsement. \nCLEVE JONES (reading the article) They endorsed you for being a good businessman? Has Scott read this? He'll piss himself. \nHARVEY MILK Yeah? Go show him. (Cleve starts to go) \n(MORE) \nHARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Cleve, maybe you should go find a boy to celebrate with. Just in case. \nCLEVE JONES I'm going to The Stud. Meet me out. Cleve goes. His energy is boundless. Harvey sits alone watching the bargoers return home through his front window. A bitter-sweetness lingers. A couple waves, one shouts out: \nJIM RIVALDO \n(YES) We'll deal with him tomorrow. Harvey is DOUSED with champagne. \nJUMP TO: Harvey is interviewed by a TV REPORTER. Jack squeezes his way under Harvey's arm and into the picture. \nCHANNEL 5 REPORTER Does this mean, as many straights are concerned, maybe the gays are taking over San Francisco? Are you going to be a Supervisor for all the people? \nHARVEY MILK I have to be. That's what I was elected for. I have to be there to open up the dialogue for the sensitivities of all people, all their problems, the problems that effect this city effect all of us. (toasts the camera) Thank you San Francisco! Thank you! \n77 EXT. MARKET STREET MONTAGE - DAY - JAN 1978 \nSET TO MUSIC: In his old brown suit, Harvey walks to City Hall with a crowd of supporters. The familiar faces now include Jack Lira. \n78 EXT. CITY HALL - DAY \nOn City Hall's steps, Mayor Moscone swears in HARVEY. \nHARVEY MILK I, Harvey Milk, do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of California against all enemies, foreign and domestic; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties upon which I am about to enter and during such time as I hold the office of Supervisor, City and County of San Francisco. Bulbs FLASH. A light rain begins to fall. Umbrellas go up. \nHARVEY MILK(CONT'D) Anita Bryant said gay people brought the drought to California. Looks to me like it's finally started raining! Cheers. Harvey is emboldened. \n79 INT. SCOTT'S APARTMENT / TV SET - MORNING \nOff a TV in Scott's NEW APARTMENT, we see a S.F. Morning show featuring new Supervisors, Harvey Milk and Dan White. \nHOST (ON TV) This will be the first time in many years that we've seen so many new faces on the Board of Supervisors. Do you think such diversity will cripple the Board? \nHARVEY MILK (ON TV) The name of the game on the Board is six votes to get anything passed. So, like it or not, Dan and I are now in bed together... politically speaking. THE CAMERA REVEALS SCOTT watching the program. He's been up all night. \nDAN WHITE (ON TV) I've assured Harvey here that my brochure's comments about \"social deviants\" referred more to junkies than to his people. See, I'm about to have my first child. I have to make sure this city remains a decent place to raise him. \n80 INT. TELEVISION STATION - MOMENTS LATER \nThe segment over, sound assistants help Harvey and Dan remove their microphones. Harvey tries to draw Dan in: \nHARVEY MILK How long were you a fireman, Dan? \nDAN WHITE A couple of years. \nHARVEY MILK And before that... You were a police officer? Dan studies Harvey suspiciously... What's his point? \nDAN WHITE You have something against cops? \nHARVEY MILK No. They tend to have something against me. \n(MORE) \nHARVEY MILK (CONT'D) (seeing Dan react uncomfortably) But firefighters. Now those are true heroes... They supported me in the last campaign. I support them fully. \nDAN WHITE I appreciate it. \nHARVEY MILK I meant what I said. I'd like to work together. Dan hesitantly accepts Harvey's handshake. It's a step. \nDAN WHITE (cracking a smile) I'll see you at the office, Mr. Milk. \n81 INT. CITY HALL - DAY \nHarvey goes through the metal detectors at the entrance and finds Cleve in a NEW SUIT waiting for the elevator. \nHARVEY MILK Privacy's our enemy. You want real political power? Let's tell the truth for a change. Starting here. If there's anybody in this room, right now, who hasn't told their families, their friends, their employers... Do it. Now. \nANNE KRONENBERG My folks know already. A beat. The room is silent. Dick looks ill. \nDICK PABICH I haven't told my father yet... \nHARVEY MILK (a beat, then) People vote two to one for us if they know just one of us. \n(BEAT) Cleve, show Dick where you keep your phone. \nCLEVE JONES It's in the bedroom. After a moment, Dick RISES and follows Cleve out of the room. People are stunned by Harvey's outrageous demand. Harvey sees Scott GLARING at him. \n93 EXT. CLEVE'S APARTMENT / STAIRCASE - LATER \nThe meeting is breaking up, and Scott lets his NEW BOYFRIEND go ahead. Harvey ducks away from Jack and intercepts Scott. \nHARVEY MILK I thought you were done with politics. \nSCOTT SMITH Politics. Not the movement. What the hell was that in there? \nHARVEY MILK The movement needs people to be up- front. Why were you fighting me? \nSCOTT SMITH You were the biggest closet case alive in New York. You told me and all your boyfriends to keep our \n(MORE) \nSCOTT SMITH (CONT'D) traps shut. You were the hypocrite in there. \nHARVEY MILK My parents are gone. My brother knows. I'm sure they knew. \nSCOTT SMITH I had to listen to your phone calls home to Mom. Hear you deny that I existed. You want to be \"normal\" as bad as any of us. More than any of us... Those are kids in there. You're asking them to lose their families. \nHARVEY MILK If their families won't love them for who they are, who they really are, then they should lose them. \nSCOTT SMITH That's fucking insane. \nHARVEY MILK (re: Scott's new Boyfriend) Who's he? Do you live together? \nSCOTT SMITH Someone I'm seeing. He's good for me. He makes me stay home at nights, out of the bars... \nHARVEY MILK (quietly, so Jack doesn't hear) I miss you. \nSCOTT SMITH Oh, Harvey, don't... (eyeing Jack down the street) What's that about? \nJACK LIRA (calling out) Har-veyyyyy! \nHARVEY MILK He needs me. Scott nods. THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN HARVEY'S ACHILLES HEAL. He walks away from Harvey, leaving him alone. \n94 INT. CITY HALL / SUPERVISORS' CHAMBERS - DAY \nDianne bangs her gavel like a mad woman. Harvey's adamant. \nHARVEY MILK DIANNE FEINSTEIN I have told no lies here Supervisor Milk, you will today or to Supervisor White come to order. in the past-- \nHARVEY MILK --I want it noted that I never promised to back moving any Mental Health Centers. I greatly respect Supervisor White, but I would like his remarks stricken. \nDIANNE FEINSTEIN Duly noted. We will take a recess before recording the vote. Fellow Supervisor, CAROL RUTH SILVER, leans over to Harvey. \nCAROL RUTH SILVER Thank you, Harvey. Harvey is preoccupied with Dan approaching. He leans back. \nHARVEY MILK You're an activist. Take it. March them. (off Cleve, unsure) March those people up to the front doors of City Hall. When it looks really bad, the city's first gay Supervisor will come out and play peacemaker. We save the city from a riot. We can turn this night into more political power for the cause. \nCLEVE JONES I can't do it like you do it. \nHARVEY MILK I won't always be here. Somebody else will have to take over. (looking him in the eye) I need you to be the scary one now. \n100 EXT. CASTRO AND MARKET STREET - NIGHT \nA massive, angry crowd has gathered. Baby-faced Cleve takes a makeshift stage. He lifts the bullhorn and with nerves, reads a speech. Its pages blow about. CLEVE'S POV: Harvey watches from afar. Encouraging him. \nCLEVE JONES Forty years ago tonight, the gay citizens of Germany found out they no longer had civil rights. Tomorrow morning, the gay citizens of Wichita will also awaken to find that they too have lost their civil rights. You have whistles. You use them when we have been attacked. Tonight we have been attacked. Initially Cleve is successful, but then the crowd turns, marching toward City Hall without him. \nCLEVE JONES(CONT'D) Fuck. Shit. Harvey! Cleve runs as fast as he can to cut through the crowd, to get to the front. He gets on his walkie-talkie. \nCLEVE JONES (CONT'D) Get the press to the overpass! ON HARVEY: Ducking through EMPTY STREETS, trying to get AHEAD OF THE CROWD and beat them to City Hall. \nCleve gets to the head of the crowd. \nCLEVE JONES (CONT'D) Move... Left... Move... Left... \nJIM RIVALDO (charging up) What are you doing? Where's Harvey? \nCLEVE JONES We're shutting down traffic, both directions. Cleve looks up at the press that's arrived on the overpass above, and turns to two HIPPIE KIDS near the front. \nCLEVE JONES(CONT'D) Disconnect the power arms! The boys climb up a trolley and knock down the power arms. Sparks fly. Brakes squeal. The press snaps photos. \n100B INT. CASTRO STREET BAR - NIGHT \nThe angry protesters march past the large glass windows of TWIN PEAKS bar. Unlike the Dade County march, the bar is empty. The patrons are already in the streets. \n101 INT. CITY HALL - LATER \nHarvey RACES to his office. He stops at a mirror to straighten his tie and collect himself. OUTSIDE: The SOUND of the ANGRY MOB on City Hall's front steps. \"Civil Rights or Civil War!\" Someone THROWS A ROCK at the City Hall doors. Harvey rushes out the front doors, pushing past the police to greet THE MOB on City Hall's front steps. Through the glass doors we see Cleve rush up and hand Harvey his bullhorn: \nHARVEY MILK Hello. My name is Harvey Milk, and I want to recruit you. (AN ENORMOUS CHEER rises) I want to recruit you for the fight to preserve our democracy against the Anita Bryants and John Briggs who are trying to legalize bigotry! We have a choice to make. The fight is at our doors. We must either go back in the closet and shut it tight, or fight... History shows \n(MORE) \nHARVEY MILK (CONT'D) that if we continue to fight, we... will... win. \n101B INT. CITY HALL / HARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY \nJim, Dick, Anne, Michael, Frank and Cleve are all in the office. The FRONT PAGE of the Examiner features a PICTURE OF CLEVE AND HARVEY ARM IN ARM on City Hall's steps. Cleve is jazzed. Harvey stews. \nCLEVE JONES They're calling it a \"successful mediation.\" You're a God damn hero. Fuck. It came this close to a riot. \nHARVEY Lose the note cards next time. Your job is just to say into that bullhorn what they're all feeling. \nCLEVE JONES You're just jealous it wasn't you out there. \nHARVEY MILK We're losing Prop Six by 60% and you're over there celebrating a riot. I need more visibility... (the real problem:) If we're going to beat this thing, we have to get Briggs to acknowledge us. Harvey steps away, hot, pensive. Anne gets quiet. \nANNE KRONENBERG Every paper's calling Prop Six the main event now. We lose this, we'll have anti-gay laws in all fifty states, and Briggs won't return our calls for a public debate. \nDICK PABICH He's ignoring us to death. \nHARVEY MILK (steaming back in) We need something populist. What's the number one complaint about city life? \nCLEVE JONES The piss smell in the Tenderloin. \nHARVEY MILK Listen, I know you're disappointed about the Psychiatric Center... What else do you have coming up? \nDAN WHITE Now you need something from me. You want my me to join in with the Queers on this Prop Six business? \nHARVEY MILK We prefer the word \"gay,\" Dan. Just as I'm sure you prefer the word, \"Irish-American\" to \"Mick.\" \nDAN WHITE Harvey, our society can't exist without the family, without the church. \nHARVEY MILK We're not against those things. \nDAN WHITE You're not? Can two men reproduce? \nHARVEY MILK (a smile) No. But, we keep trying! \n(SERIOUSLY) \n(MORE) \nHARVEY MILK (CONT'D) C'mon, Dan. You're channeling Anita and Briggs... we can work together. On something... \nDAN WHITE Okay. You introduce an initiative for Supervisor pay raises. \nHARVEY MILK (anything but that) It's a bad time politically. I have an election next year. \nDAN WHITE You asked for something. Introduce pay raises. I can't take care of my family on our salaries. You don't have that problem, do you? Dan's AIDE steps into the doorway. She seems surprised to see Harvey in Dan's office. \nDAN WHITE (CONT'D) Mr. Milk, You'll excuse me, I have a development meeting. Dan goes. \n108 INT. A SAN FRANCISCO HALL - NIGHT \nA crowd sings \u00e2\u0080\u009cHappy Birthday.\u00e2\u0080\u009d One after another, Harvey's guests throw CREAM PIES in his face. RICK AND DAVID GOODSTEIN INCLUDED. A PEACE OFFERING. Harvey wipes pie from his eyes. In the B.G. the black drag queen sensation, SYLVESTER, breaks into his top 10 anthem, \"You Make Me Feel.\" It's a who's who of San Francisco's political elite. Jack scoots up to Harvey. \nHARVEY MILK What's wrong, Taco Bell? \nJACK LIRA Anne and Cleve tried to cut me out of your table. You should fire them. \nHARVEY MILK I'll take it under consideration. Why don't you get us a drink? A kiss and Jack heads to the bar. Scott approaches. \nSCOTT SMITH Don't let Cezar Chavez hear you calling him Taco Bell. \nHARVEY MILK He's getting better. He's enrolling in classes on Monday. Scott wipes PIE CREAM from Harvey's jacket. \nSCOTT SMITH I remember when your birthdays were a bit less... lavish. More intimate. \nHARVEY MILK Who invited you? Anne? \nSCOTT SMITH My boyfriend got an invitation. I was his \"plus one.\" \nHARVEY MILK Congratulations. It was a tough ticket to get. \nSCOTT SMITH Congratulations to you. Looks like you're part of the Machine now. (Harvey looks away, toward Jack) You can do better. \nHARVEY MILK When I come home to Jack, I don't have to talk politics or talk intelligently. Or even talk. \n(SELF-DEPRECATING) And where's an old man like me going to get such a good looking young man, right? \nSCOTT SMITH You're not so old. You look handsome... Happy 48th. Looks like you're gonna make it to fifty after- all, Mr. Milk. Scott gives Harvey a BIRTHDAY KISS. \n109 INT. A SAN FRANCISCO HALL - LATER THAT NIGHT \nHARVEY MILK It could happen any day, any night, any time... (off the ROARING CROWD that's waiting for him) The nation's eye is on us. I have to do this. JUMP TO: POV shots of cops and loners amongst the massive audience hint at Harvey's paranoia. Like diving off a cliff, Harvey launches up to the microphone. The deafening cheers surely would have drowned \nout gunfire, but when it fades, He's standing. He delivers his impassioned call to action: \nHARVEY MILK (CONT'D) My name is Harvey Milk, and I want to recruit you. I want to recruit you for the fight to preserve your democracy. Brothers and sisters, you must come out. Come out to your parents. I know that it is hard and will hurt them but think about how they will hurt you in the voting booth! Come out to your friends, if they indeed are your friends. Come out to your neighbors, to your fellow workers. Once and for all, break down the myths, destroy the lies and distortions. For your sake. For their sake. For the sake of the youngsters who are becoming scared by the votes from Dade to Eugene. On the Statue of Liberty it says \"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to be free.\" In the Declaration of Independence it is written \"All men are created equal and are endowed with certain inalienable rights.\" For Mr. Briggs and Mrs. Bryant and all the bigots out there, no matter how hard you try, you cannot erase those words from the Declaration of Independence. No matter how hard you try, you cannot chip those words from off the base of the Statue of Liberty. That is what America is. Love it or leave it. Wild applause. He scans the crowd as he steps off stage. A bit surprised to still be alive. Cleve grabs him. \nCLEVE JONES The Mayor says Briggs is on his way here. He could intercept him for us. We could get him face to face. He couldn't ignore us anymore. \nHARVEY MILK Get the press. \n113 INT. LIMOUSINE / 5 BLOCKS FROM THE FREEDOM DAY PARADE - SAME \nJohn Briggs rides in a limo watching the \u00e2\u0080\u009cfreaks\" outside. As he nears the Parade Stages his POLICE ESCORTS take an unplanned turn. He leans forward. \nJOHN BRIGGS The parade is the other direction. \nDRIVER They're taking us another way, Sir. \n114 INT. WAREHOUSE ON THE PIER - MOMENTS LATER \nThe limo pulls in. Briggs cautiously steps out. Greeting him are Moscone, the POLICE CHIEF, 25 SFPD officers, a gaggle of press, and Harvey Milk. It's a showdown... HIGH NOON. \nJOHN BRIGGS I have a right to be here, Mr. Mayor. \nMAYOR MOSCONE I'm afraid it's not in the interest of your safety, or my public's safety to let you into that parade grounds. Finally face to face, Harvey extends his hand. Its a show for the FLASHING CAMERAS. Briggs is clearly uncomfortable. \nHARVEY MILK Hi, I'm Harvey Milk. It's quite an honor to meet you, Mr. Briggs. \nJOHN BRIGGS I'm aware. Sad you're too afraid to fight this out in public, Mr. Milk. \nHARVEY MILK No sir. I would love to have a public debate. I'm very interested in the details of your argument. \nJOHN BRIGGS You know the details. As do the people. Look at the votes across this nation. The \"public\" is with me. \nHARVEY MILK Yes sir, today they are. But with my City's Mayor and the San Francisco press as my witnesses, I'm challenging you to a public debate. John nods, stiff. He can no longer avoid Harvey Milk. He gets back in his limo. \nINT. SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT - (ON TV) 115 \nHarvey sits with John Briggs at a table facing forward. We hear the cheers and jeers of the packed audience. \nHARVEY MILK Senator, as a Christian it's interesting that you don't seem to understand what Christ was about. He was about accepting people and giving love, not carrying a Bible in one hand and hatred in the other... (cheers from the audience) ...Now all the gay myths have been shattered, all the fears, all the-- \nJOHN BRIGGS Not in my mind they haven't-- \nHARVEY MILK That's it. In your mind they haven't, and I'm wondering why-- \nJOHN BRIGGS Mr. Milk, we don't allow people who believe in practicing bestiality to teach our children, and the reason we don't is because it is illegal. But it's not illegal to be a homosexual in California. \nHARVEY MILK And your law goes even further. Any school employee who even supports a gay person will be fired-- \nJOHN BRIGGS True. But, gay people don't have children of their own. If they don't recruit our children, they'd all die away. That's why they want to be teachers, to encourage our children to join them. \nHARVEY MILK (ON TV) How do you teach homosexuality? Like French? I was born of heterosexual parents, I was taught by heterosexual teachers in a fiercely heterosexual society. So then why am I homosexual? And no offense meant, but if it were true that children mimicked their \n(MORE) \nHARVEY MILK (ON TV) (CONT'D) teachers, you'd sure have a helluva lot more nuns running around. The audience eats it up. It feel like \"The Harvey Milk Show.\" \n116 EXT. CITY HALL - DAY \nJOHN BRIGGS (getting more lost) No, no, I'm not saying that at all-- \nHARVEY MILK That's what you just said. \nJOHN BRIGGS No. I'm saying that we cannot prevent child molestation so let's cut our odds down and take out the homosexual group and keep in the heterosexual group-- Harvey laughs in disbelief at the asinine argument. Briggs looks down to his notes, lost. Harvey takes the opportunity to rip into the State Senator: \nHARVEY MILK (directly to Briggs) --Sir, in your own drive for personal power, how many careers are you willing to see destroyed? How many lives will you destroy in your lust for power, and when will you stop? The crowd boos, rails. This isn't San Francisco, it's Orange County. In the audience, Dick Pabich sweats, taken aback by the level of hatred. Harvey tries to maintain his composure. \n120 EXT. CASTRO STREET - NIGHT \nHarvey heads home from work. He starts into his store. He sees JACK LIRA'S SHADOW through the curtains upstairs, and turns instead to the cafe next door. \n121 INT. CASTRO CAFE - NIGHT \nHarvey sits down at the bar. The WAITER pours a coffee for him. Harvey looks up to the TV. HARVEY'S POV: DAN WHITE ON TV talking to a news reporter. It feels as if Dan is talking directly to Harvey. \nDAN WHITE All I'm really saying is, if we don't protect ourselves with this kind of legislation, a transvestite can show up at a public school with all the qualifications for teaching and they can't refuse to hire him. \n122 INT. CITY HALL / HARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY \nHarvey rushes from a packed session in the Supervisors' Chambers to his office. Anne is behind him. He picks up the phone. It seems urgent. \nHARVEY MILK Hey Jack, what's wrong? \n123 INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - INTERCUT \nJACK LIRA Nothing. I just want to know when you'll be home. \nHARVEY MILK You just had them pull me out of my big vote on the dog shit ordinance. Did you do this on purpose, Jack? \nJACK LIRA It's poop, Harvey. Aren't I more important than poop? \nHARVEY MILK Yes, but... I don't know when I'll be home. Maybe 6. 6:15. \nJACK LIRA Fine. 6:15. Harvey hangs up. His patience is slipping. He looks up in time to see Dan heading down the hall with his briefcase. \n124 INT. CITY HALL / SUPERVISORS' CHAMBERS HALLWAY - DAY \nHarvey catches up to Dan who is on his way out. \nHARVEY MILK Dan? How's the baby? \nDAN WHITE You didn't bring up Supervisor pay raises. In fact, I heard you plan to publicly oppose them. \nHARVEY MILK I heard you planned to vote against them too, Dan. Were you trying to set me up? \nDAN WHITE (parrotting Harvey \nEARLIER) \n(MORE) \nDAN WHITE (CONT'D) It's not a good time for me to bring it up. Politically. \nHARVEY MILK Dan, there's a vote to approve the police desegregation settlement, give me that and I'll consider backing pay raises. \nDAN WHITE (suddenly very dark) I don't trade votes... unlike you, the way I was raised, we believe in right and wrong. Moral and immoral. \nHARVEY MILK Black skin and White in your police department? (Dan steams) Dan, even Ronald Reagan's come out against Proposition Six. You're looking more and more out of touch. \nGIRL No. What the heck are you? \nHARVEY MILK Oh, me? I'm an elected official. I run this city. \nHe makes a show of it. She smiles. He hands her the flower he's been holding onto all afternoon. \n130 INT. \"NO ON SIX\" CENTER / MARKET STREET - NIGHT \nTHIS IS THE MOMENT. Harvey watches aides on the phones comb districts for voting results. Jim fills up a map on the wall. \nDICK PABICH San Bernadino is coming in. Not good. \nHARVEY MILK Of course not. How not good? \nMICHAEL WONG 60% for Briggs. Same in Fresno. \nHARVEY MILK Dear God, little Lotus Blossom. Harvey is stunned. Other districts follow with similar results. They go up in red on the map. \nJIM RIVALDO Imperial is 69% \"for\" so far. \nHARVEY MILK Put it up on the board. Harvey tries to stomach this major defeat, loss after loss. He starts reflexively tying his tie in a knot. Cleve comes up to Harvey, concerned. \nHARVEY MILK (CONT'D) The whole world is watching this. This is San Francisco we're about to lose. Are you ready? \nCLEVE JONES I can have 15,000 people in an hour. But there's gonna be riots if this thing passes. \nHARVEY MILK (darkens, pointed) There goddamn better be. \nCLEVE JONES (stops, a beat, then:) What are you telling me? \nHARVEY MILK I can't say it because I'm a public official, but for God's sake, if this thing passes, fight back. Cleve is stunned, holding the weight of Harvey's words. Harvey's focus is interrupted when Anne brings him the phone. \nANNE KRONENBERG Don Amador down in LA. \nHARVEY (reluctantly answers) Kind of a bad time, Don. \nYOUNG TEEN (V.O.) No sir, this is Paul. Don just gave me the phone. \nHARVEY MILK Paul who? \nYOUNG TEEN (V.O.) You talked to me on the phone a year or so ago. I'm from Minnesota... I'm in a wheelchair. REVEAL: The boy in his wheelchair on the other end. \nHARVEY MILK (a beat to take it in, then:) I thought you were a goner, Paul. \nYOUNG TEEN I'm sorry. I should have called. When I read in the paper that you won the Supervisor seat, I got a friend to put me on a bus to LA. \nHARVEY MILK Who did you know in Los Angeles? \nYOUNG TEEN Nobody. That's the uh... I just didn't want to die anymore, sir. (Harvey's at a loss for words) I met your friend Don down here. I turned 18. I voted today against Prop Six... Thank you, Mr. Milk. \nHARVEY MILK No. You did this all by yourself. \nYOUNG TEEN I don't think I'd be alive right now without you, sir. You were right about LA. It's like gay Disney World. \nHARVEY MILK Then you have to see San Francisco! \nYOUNG TEEN Okay. I will. Don wanted me to um... congratulate you on what he says looks like a big win for us tonight. Congratulations Mr. Milk. Harvey turns back to the map. Jim Rivaldo is now coloring in LA county with green. On the other end of the phone, Harvey's friend in LA, Don Amador, is back on the line. \nDON AMADOR (V.O.) It looks like we've taken LA County, Harvey. By 65%. It's huge. \n136 INT. TV NEWS REPORT - DAY \nACTUAL FOOTAGE: Channel 5 reporting from Dan White's street: \nDAVID FOWLER (ON TV) Most people were surprised when Dan White quit last Friday citing financial difficulties. Now we've heard that White is asking for his Supervisor job back. But many say-- \n137 INT. CITY HALL / HARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY \nHarvey, watching on the small TV set in his office. \nDAVID FOWLER (ON TV) --White gave up all of his political chits when he resigned without making any arrangements. The news story transitions in the B.G. as Harvey gets up. \nNEWS ANCHOR (ON TV/BG) The city of San Francisco is in disbelief. Four-hundred bodies have been found thus far in Jonestown, Guyana. Leader of the People's Temple, Jim Jones... \n138 INT. CITY HALL / DAN WHITE'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER \nHarvey heads to Dan's office. He toys with the nameplate. Something bittersweet lingers. He walks in. HARVEY'S POV: On City Hall's lawn, Dan is with the press. He looks up, seeing Harvey in his office window. They make eye contact. It bears all the awkwardness of a relationship lost. \n139 EXT. CITY HALL - MOMENTS LATER \nSomething's snapped. With adolescent frustration in evidence, Dan is with his wife, the press and a few supporters. \nDAN WHITE It was a major decision on Friday that I had to come... to arrive at. But since that time, people unknown to me, plus my family and friends, have come to me and stated that they want me to stay in office, that they support me... So I'm asking the Mayor to let me stay in office to serve the people... \n140 INT. CITY HALL / MAYOR MOSCONE'S OFFICE - DAY \nHarvey is firm, his hands planted on the Mayor's desk. \nHARVEY MILK He gets dragged into a closed door meeting with the Police Officers Association, and comes out demanding his job back? What do you think they promised him? Or worse, how did they threaten him? \nMAYOR MOSCONE A man has the right to change his mind. Give me some peace. \nHARVEY MILK How many of our propositions has Dan shut down? We could finally settle this police desegregation nonsense. Cement rent control. It's his vote on this Board that stands in our way. \nMAYOR MOSCONE I get it, Harvey. I've been lobbied all week. Enough. \nHARVEY MILK Let me just remind you that you're up for re-election. If you re- appoint Dan, you lose the gay vote. They listen to me. You won't get elected dog catcher. \nMAYOR MOSCONE (stern, silent, a beat, then:) I'll make my decision on Monday. (as Harvey's on his way out, with a wry grin) You know what you sounded like just now? Boss Tweed or Mayor Daly. \nHARVEY MILK (returns the smile) A \"homosexual\" with a bit of power... rather scary isn't it, Mr. Mayor? OFF Harvey. He's come a long way. \nOPERA MUSIC CROSSES THE CUT TO: \n141 INT. SAN FRANCISCO OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT \nHarvey sits in a balcony seat of the filled, darkened opera house next to Brazilian opera star BIDU SAYAO, 76. He's enraptured by a production of TOSCA. ON STAGE IT'S \"O Scarpia, we shall meet before God!\" Refusing to be taken prisoner, Tosca jumps from the walls of the castle set to her death. \n142 INT. DAN WHITE'S HOME / LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nMary Ann offers the phone to Dan. Dan takes it. \nDAN WHITE (into the phone) Yes. This is Dan White. \nKCBS REPORTER (V.O.) I'm Barbra Taylor from KCBS. I'm interested in your reaction. I've received information from the Mayor's office that you won't be getting your job back. \nDAN WHITE I'm sorry. I don't know anything about that. Dan hangs up on her. \n143 INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT \nHARVEY MILK (grins ear to ear) Heaven forbid, Dianne. \n148 INT. CITY HALL / MAYOR MOSCONE'S WAITING ROOM - SAME \nThe MAYOR'S SECRETARY sits at her desk. Shouting can be heard from inside his office. \n149 INT. CITY HALL / MAYOR MOSCONE'S OFFICE - SAME \nMoscone leads Dan White to the bar beside his office. Dan is enraged. Moscone lights a cigarette. \nDAN WHITE You can't take this away from me! Moscone has his back turned, pouring them cocktails. \nMAYOR MOSCONE The issue is what's fair, for the people of your district. Take some time off. Spend it with your family. \nMoscone finishes pouring two cocktails, and turns to see Dan White brandishing his revolver. \n150 INT. CITY HALL / MAYOR MOSCONE'S WAITING ROOM - SAME \nMoscone's Secretary, and a WAITING MAN note the THREE DULL THUDS, not so different than a backfire. The secretary looks out the window, concerned. The waiting man checks his watch. \n151 INT. CITY HALL / MAYOR MOSCONE'S OFFICE - SAME \nStill gripped in his hand, Moscone's cigarette burns a hole in his tie. \n152 INT. CITY HALL / SUPERVISORS' OFFICES - MOMENTS LATER \nDan walks past Dick Pabich, past Dianne's office. Harvey's voice can be heard down the hall. He sounds up-beat, \nOPTIMISTIC: \nHARVEY MILK (V.O.) This time next year we're marching on Washington D.C. It'll look like Market and Castro, but with a million people. Write that down. Tell President Carter we're coming after him next. I'm going to deposit this. I'll be back in 20 minutes. Dan arrives at Harvey's office door. Harvey is with a FRIEND, preparing to leave, surprised to see Dan in his doorway. \nDAN WHITE Say, Harve, can I see you for a minute? \nHARVEY MILK Sure. Dan walks Harvey down the hall to his old office. \n153 INT. CITY HALL / DAN WHITE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nHarvey walks in first. Dan stays between Harvey and the door. Dan closes it. Harvey smiles, sensing something is off. Dan draws his revolver. Harvey raises his hand. Dan Fires. The bullet rips through Harvey's hand and down his arm. \nHARVEY MILK Oh no... N-- Dan Fires again, silencing Harvey's cry for help. \nHarvey turns away. Another bullet rips into his chest, and he falls to his knees, now facing the window. He staggers toward it. The moment is extended as we see Harvey's POV of the Opera House outside the window, and the Castro beyond it. HOLD ON HARVEY, gazing out at his beloved city. Dan puts his revolver to the back of Harvey's head. HE FIRES. And just like that, Harvey falls. \nHARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) Last week I got a phone call-- \n156 INT. FLASH BACK - HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL \nHarvey is still speaking into the tape recorder... \nHARVEY --from Altoona, Pennsylvania, and the voice was quite young, and the person said... \"Thanks.\" You've got to elect gay people so that that young child and the thousands upon thousand like him know there's hope... hope for a better world... \n157 INT. MEMORIAL SERVICE / SAN FRANCISCO - EARLY EVENING \nScott and Anne enter a sparsely attended memorial service. Most of the seats are empty. The speaker is unfamiliar, some appointed CITY OFFICIAL. \nSCOTT SMITH (finally crumbling, tears roll) Where is everybody? Didn't anyone give a damn? \n158 INT. FLASH BACK - HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL \n", "test1_input": "HARVEY MILK ...if we had someone in the government who saw things the way we see them, the way the black community has black leaders who look out for their interests-- \nSCOTT SMITH You're gonna run for Supervisor, is that the idea? \nHARVEY MILK \n(HALF-JOKING) I could go right for mayor, but I think I should work my way up to it... You'll be my campaign manager. \nSCOTT SMITH \n(SARCASTIC) Because I have so much experience in politics. \nHARVEY MILK Politics is theater. It doesn't matter if you win. You make a statement. You say, \"I'm here, pay attention to me.\" \nSCOTT SMITH Harvey, you do that every time you cross the street. \nHARVEY MILK Coors looks like it might cave. The union boys will owe me. Imagine if we get their vote... It'll be fun! \nSCOTT SMITH Fun? Harvey starts kissing him all over. \nHARVEY MILK We'll make it a spectacle. \n31 EXT. CASTRO STREET - DAY \nHarvey walks down to Market St. with a box. He waves, shakes, flirts with everyone. His warmest hello is from a gruff UNION MAN. Behind Harvey, Scott pushes a loaded shopping cart. Harvey sets his box down right beside a SFPD OFFICER. It reads, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSoap Box.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Harvey steps onto it. A crowd forms. \nHARVEY MILK A week ago, Police officers came into our area with covered up badges and sent fourteen of our people to the hospitals, and to jail. The charges, \"Blocking a Sidewalk.\" Like a round girl at a boxing match, Scott parades around a blown up PHOTO from his shopping cart: TWO SF COPS DRAGGING \nGAY MEN INTO A PADDY WAGON. \nHARVEY MILK (CONT'D) --Let us have our tax money go for our protection and not our persecution. Worry about gun control and not marijuana control. \n(MORE) \nHARVEY MILK (CONT'D) School supplies, seniors, not what books I read-- Scott displays an old \"Muscle Boys\" magazine. Harvey does a well timed take. A few hoots from the eclectic crowd. \nHARVEY MILK (CONT'D) My fellow degenerates, I would like to announce my candidacy for San Francisco City Supervisor! Scott unfurls three hand made \"MILK FOR CITY SUPERVISOR\" banners that lap over the sides of the shopping cart. \n32 EXT. VARIOUS STREETS IN SF - HANDING OUT FLYERS MONTAGE \nWE SEE SCOTT, DANNY, JIM handing out FLYERS to a variety of SF CITIZENS: gay boys, older people, Chinese people, scared straight people, heckling high school boys. Harvey EAGERLY APPROACHES anyone and everyone, shaking hands if they'll let him, reaching out to old people, straight people, gay people, even buttoned down BUSINESSMEN who cross the street to try to get away from him. \n33 EXT. THE CASTRO/18TH AND CASTRO - DAY \nHarvey hands out campaign literature to a PASSERSBY. \nHARVEY MILK Public dental care for retired people... Legalize pot, vote Milk. Harvey is distracted. A young, long haired CLEVE JONES passes. At 18, he looks 15. Harvey tries for his attention: \nHARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Hey, I like the way your pants fit... Where are you from, kid? \nCLEVE JONES \n(LAUGHS) Sorry old man, not interested. \nHARVEY MILK Where's home? \nCLEVE JONES Phoenix. \nHARVEY MILK I'm Harvey Milk. I'm running for Supervisor. What's your name? \n", "test1_true": "HARVEY MILK Well Mr. Jones, we should walk up to my camera shop and register you. \nCLEVE JONES Fuck that. Elections of any kind are a bourgeois affectation. \nHARVEY MILK Is that right? Do you trick up on Polk Street? \nCLEVE JONES (only half-joking) If I need the cash... But I'm selective about my clients. \nHARVEY MILK Tell me one thing before you get back to work then. What was it like to be a little queer in Phoenix? \nCLEVE JONES I faked a lung disease to get out of PE. So what? What are you, some kind of street shrink? \nHARVEY MILK Sometimes. But what I'm saying is, Phoenix can change. But we have to start with our street: rent control, police abuse, pot, parks, seniors. \nCLEVE JONES (turns to go) Well, good luck with all that. \nHARVEY MILK You know what I think, Cleve Jones? \nCLEVE JONES That you're gonna get somewhere if you keep talking? \nHARVEY MILK No. That you need to do what you're good at. Be a prick. Fight City Hall. Fight the cops. Fight the people who made you come here to do what you do. \nCLEVE JONES Sorry old man, I'm leaving for Spain tomorrow. Europe. Got all the cash I need in my back pocket. A GROUP OF CLEVE'S FRIENDS shout at him to join them. Harvey watches him dart across the street to his friends. \nHARVEY MILK (V.O.) I didn't come out until very late in life. There was nobody to-- \n34 INT. FLASH FORWARD - HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL \nHARVEY MILK --look up to, no hope for a better life. Those that did were outcast... arrested.. suicide. And the young ones, who did escape home... and who arrive in San Francisco, and then what... \n35 EXT. CHURCH STREET - EVENING \nANGLE ON: PARAMEDICS placing a BLOODY VICTIM into a BODY BAG. \nCOP The \u00e2\u0080\u009cfruit\u00e2\u0080\u009d was walking home with his \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrick\u00e2\u0080\u009d when they were jumped. REVEAL: Harvey picks a blood stained whistle up off the street, the man's last attempt to call for help. \nCOP (CONT'D) (from the victim's wallet) Name's Robert Hillsborough. Did you know him? \nHARVEY MILK He used to come into my shop. Are there any witnesses? \nCOP Just the \"trick.\" Jerry Taylor. \nHARVEY MILK Jerry wasn't a trick. They were lovers. \nCOP Call it what you will. He's our only witness and he says he can't identify the attackers. \nHARVEY MILK There'd be a dozen witnesses if they thought you boys had any real interest in keeping them safe. \nCOP You're the Mayor of Castro Street now, right Harvey? You really wanna help? Get your people to show some discretion on the streets, huh? HARVEY'S POV: The PARAMEDICS pull up the zipper on the body bag. We follow the zipper past the victim's bloody hands, his torso, his face. \n36 INT. CASTRO CAMERA - DAY \nCLOSE ON: A CUSTOMER'S SET OF PHOTOS BEING PASSED FROM HAND TO HAND DURING THE FOLLOWING POLITICAL MEETING. (We catch a glimpse of the PHOTOS and see naked skin). \nJIM RIVALDO Well, it looks like the big guns and the rich gays in San Francisco are going to back Dianne Feinstein and other straight candidates they consider \"gay-friendly.\" \nSCOTT SMITH Who cares about those old queens? Scott is laying down on THE BIG RED COUCH. \nHARVEY MILK Why isn't my campaign manager leading the meeting? \n", "test2_input": "HARVEY Jack? \nJACK LIRA Welcome home, Harvey! I hope you're hungry. I only know how to cook one thing, but I make it good. \nHARVEY Did you... break in? \nJACK LIRA I asked the boy downstairs to let me in... \nHARVEY Danny? \nJACK LIRA He wouldn't let me in. So I came in this way. Your friends aren't very nice to me. \nHARVEY (avoiding the fight) I have a Town Hall meeting tonight, Jack. \nJACK LIRA You work too hard. I'm sorry about your window. I'll fix it tomorrow. (turning on the charm) Are you surprised?! \nHARVEY MILK Jack, I have to go. I have an invitation to a party tomorrow. Lots of rich people, politicians. We could get all dressed up... Jack turns up the music, takes Harvey's hands and guides him through a simple dance. \nJACK LIRA So I could be the first lady? \nHARVEY MILK Uh-huh. \nJACK LIRA I watched TV here today. All day. I saw All My Children. They killed Margo. I knew it was going to happen. They try and trick you but it never works. \nHARVEY MILK (enjoying this) You always see it coming? \nJACK LIRA What? Killing the blonde? Every time. I'm good with that. (gets slow, sensual) I think now the old lady is going to have an affair. Then she'll get killed or married. Always one or the other. Dead or married. Jack starts dancing with Harvey again. It's sweet, intimate. \nHARVEY MILK If I make you a key, you won't break my windows again, right? \nJACK LIRA That's right. The dance lesson is a lovely distraction. Harvey won't be going back to work tonight. \n86 INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - DAY \nHarvey watches water pour over an INFANT BOY. He tries hard to feel comfortable, but he's the only Jew, and likely the only gay man at Dan's child's baptism. Dan looks to Harvey, the proud father. Harvey waves. \n87 INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - LATER \nHarvey and Dan have pulled themselves away. \nHARVEY MILK I'm proposing a citywide ordinance. It ensures that a person who already has a job can't be fired for their orientation. \nDAN WHITE I'm not sure my constituents would favor that. Dan looks over to his WIFE and NEWBORN SON. \nHARVEY MILK Is anyone else here from the Board? \nDAN WHITE You're the only one who showed up I think. \nHARVEY MILK Were you christened here? \nDAN WHITE Yes. Right here. Same Parish. My grandma immigrated here when this was an Irish Catholic city. The City of St. Francis... A lot's changed here since then. \nHARVEY MILK You're more like one of us now... an outsider. \nDAN WHITE You're not like most homosexuals, are you, Harvey? \nHARVEY MILK Do you know a lot of \"homosexuals?\" \nDAN WHITE (smiles, then) Say, where do you stand on the Psychiatric Center the City's been pushing into my district? \n", "test2_true": "DAN WHITE Getting it out of my district was a key piece of my platform. It only attracts arsonist, rapists, all that, you know. \nHARVEY MILK Sure, sure. A campaign promise. \nDAN WHITE A big one. \n(QUIET) What do you say we watch out for each other's interests? I'd like that. \nHARVEY MILK I'd like that, too, Dan. Mary Ann White approaches with their child. It's awkward, as if she's walked in on something intimate. \nDAN WHITE I'm sorry. Slipped into some shop talk. \nHARVEY MILK The Gay Rights Ordinance. My fault. \nMARY ANN WHITE Seems an inappropriate subject in here don't you think? \nHARVEY MILK Hey, don't knock it till you've tried it. His attempt to break the tension goes down in flames. She cracks a polite smile. They're from very different worlds. \n88 INT. HARVEY'S CITY HALL OFFICE - DAY \nHarvey is under pressure from his own advisors (Michael, Dick, Cleve) to vote against Dan's bill. \nDICK PABICH Supervisors Silver and Lau are asking you to vote to keep this Psychiatric Center in Dan's district. It'll go down 6 to 5 if you vote to get rid of it. \nMICHAEL WONG It's a Youth Campus, Harvey. These are kids that would be displaced from their families if it's moved. \nHARVEY MILK I can't just dump Dan. The guy's got nothing going for him. No friends... \nCLEVE JONES Here we go, Harvey to the rescue. Isn't it enough we have to put up with Jack? \nHARVEY MILK Lay off. He registered 120 voters last week. \nCLEVE JONES So do any of your volunteers, but you don't make them all first lady. \nMICHAEL WONG What does Dan White do for you? Really? Politically? \nHARVEY MILK He intrigues me... I think he may be one of us. Everyone groans. Cleve camps it up: \nCLEVE JONES Dear God, say it ain't so! \nHARVEY MILK It's just a theory... \nDICK PABICH You just think he's cute. \nHARVEY MILK No... I know what it's like to live that life. That lie. You can see it in Dan's eyes... The fear, the pressure... Anne Kronenberg walks in. She's got that look in her eyes. Something's up. \nHARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Good or Bad? \nANNE KRONENBERG Not great. State Senator John Briggs is Anita Bryant's go-to guy in California for sure. He's filed his petition for a statewide referendum to fire all gay teachers and anyone who supports them. A pall falls over the room. This is worse than expected. \nHARVEY MILK How many signatures will he need to qualify for the ballot? \nCLEVE JONES Whatever. He can get them in two Sundays at church in Orange County. \nHARVEY MILK (instead of fear, excitement bubbles up) This means the fight's coming here, where we can do something about it! Wichita's one thing, Kansas City. But Anita's heading for San Francisco! She's not going to know what hit her. Smile, children! This is the fight we've been waiting for. \n89 EXT. S.F. CITY HALL STEPS - DAY \nCA State Senator, JOHN BRIGGS, 47, delivers his message to the PRESS, THE TV CREWS, AND A MASS OF PROTESTERS. HARVEY AND HIS GROUP are amongst the crowd. \n", "test3_input": "JOHN BRIGGS My proposition promises to protect our children from these gay perverts and pedophiles who recruit our children to their deviant lifestyles, including the ones who \n(MORE) \nJOHN BRIGGS (CONT'D) do it in our public schools. It's time to root them out. In the crowd is teacher TOM AMMIANO, 36, colorful, worked up: \nTOM AMMIANO And how are you going to determine who's a homosexual? \nJOHN BRIGGS Sir, my bill outlines procedures for identifying homosexuals. \nANOTHER PROTESTER How? Will you be sucking them off? \nJOHN BRIGGS Sir, you can argue with me, but you cannot argue with God. It's getting ugly fast. Briggs is whisked away by TWO OFFICERS. He trips off the curb and is quickly scooped up. \n90 INT. DAN WHITE'S HOME - DAY \nDan's house is filled with RELATIVES for a birthday celebration. Dan is glued to the NEWS, watching BRIGGS. Dan's RELATIVES gather around the TV. Mary Ann puts their BABY into Dan's arms and returns to wrangling kids. \nTHE COVERAGE CUTS TO HARVEY BEING INTERVIEWED: \nHARVEY MILK (ON TV) Look what happened in Germany. Now Anita Bryant already says that Jews and Muslims are going to hell, you know she's got a shopping list. We are not going to let John Briggs or Anita Bryant legislate bigotry in this city... Hold on Dan watching Harvey on TV. \n90B INT. UPSCALE SF HOUSE - NIGHT \nCleve and Anne sit in the entry way, Cleve in his tight jeans and shirt. He's very out of place amongst all the suits. Harvey walks in. Cleve and Anne rush to his side. David Goodstein and Rick Stokes turn to greet Milk. \nDAVID GOODSTEIN Hello, Harvey. Running late? (Harvey doesn't stop) \n(MORE) \nDAVID GOODSTEIN (CONT'D) Oh Harvey... your boyfriend is in the closet. \nHARVEY MILK Excuse me, David? \nRICK STOKES \n(QUIETLY) The Latino, he's locked himself in the coat room... Mr. Milk, Phil Burton is here. He's likely the next Speaker of the House and a much needed ally against Prop Six. We don't need a scene. \n90C INT. UPSCALE S.F. HOUSE / COAT ROOM DOOR - MOMENTS LATER \nHarvey is at the door. Jack is locked inside the room. \nHARVEY MILK You're right, I know, I was late by twenty minutes. I'm sorry, Jack. \nJACK LIRA (O.S.) Who were you with? Scott? Some boy? \nHARVEY MILK I was at work. Come out, sugar pea. \nJACK LIRA (O.S.) No. You embarrassed me. I didn't know anyone. These are not good people. I don't want to be here. \nHARVEY MILK Then go home, Jack. \nJACK LIRA (O.S.) No. I'll wait for you. Go away. A tight smile from Harvey as he looks up to Cleve. \n91 INT. UPSCALE S.F. HOUSE / STUDY - LATER \nHarvey, Cleve and a dozen others are scattered about the room for a meeting with the DEMOCRATIC PARTY ESTABLISHMENT. U.S. Congressman PHIL BURTON, 51, leans on a desk, listening. \nDAVID GOODSTEIN The Briggs initiative is polling at 75 percent for approval statewide. \n", "test3_true": "DAVID GOODSTEIN (condescending to Cleve) So it's important we not deceive people into thinking we can beat this, or we'll have riots and only increase this backlash. \nHARVEY JONES Good point, David. Let's just roll right over. Make it easier for Briggs to fuck us up the ass. Rick and David are horrified. Phil Burton rises above it, passing out copies of his new Anti-Briggs Initiative flier. \nPHIL BURTON We're taking this very seriously in my office. We want to send one of these to every home in California. We'll need money to do that. \nHARVEY MILK (reading the flier) \"Proposition Six is an affront to Human Rights. An invasion of the State into the private lives of California citizens.\" (points to the pictures) Does it even say the word gay on this thing? Anywhere? \nDAVID GOODSTEIN No Harvey, purposefully not. \nPHIL BURTON With the heat bearing down on your movement right now, we think it's best to dodge the \"gay\" bullet. Go for the human rights angle. \nHARVEY MILK People need to know who's affected. This flier needs at least one old queen on it. (a dig, to Goodstein) Why don't you volunteer for that, David? \nRICK STOKES (an olive branch) Corey Wares is an out gay-- \nDAVID GOODSTEIN (cutting Rick him off) \nRICK-- \nHARVEY MILK This is shit. Shit and masturbation. It's a coward's response to a dangerous threat. \nDAVID GOODSTEIN (a beat, then) I think you should leave. In the face of Phil Burton, most the others seem to agree. HARVEY PUTS PHIL BURTON'S FLYER IN THE FIREPLACE on his way out of the room. \n91B INT. UPSCALE SF HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER \nHarvey knocks on the coat check door. \nHARVEY MILK Jack, it's time to go. (to Cleve) Get everyone together. I want young people, women, fresh heads. Fighters and organizers, not politicians. \nCLEVE JONES (as if Jack can't spell) What about, S-C-O-T-T? OFF HARVEY, knowing Scott would be an asset. Jack opens the door and grabs Harvey's hand. They go. \n92 INT. CLEVE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nHarvey's clan is assembled (Jim, Dick, Mike, Cleve, Anne, Jack, Denis) along with fiery teacher Tom Amiano and MANY \nOTHER YOUNG ACTIVISTS. A HANDSOME PIZZA DELIVERY GUY is setting down boxes of pizzas. They're in for the night. The atmosphere is 180 degrees different from the previous stuffy meeting. \nCLEVE JONES We're not interested in working with those old Democratic Party shits. THE DOOR OPENS and someone new enters. He's HOLDING THE HAND OF... SCOTT SMITH. They are obviously a new couple. \nScott and his BOYFRIEND find a place on the floor. Harvey's and Scott's EYES MEET across the room. \nJIM RIVALDO But we can't afford infighting anymore, Cleve. We have to bring together every group. Even the old school Democrats. \nHARVEY MILK (taking over) Is anybody gonna pay the pizza guy, or are we just gonna stare? People start chipping in for the HANDSOME PIZZA GUY. \nHARVEY MILK (CONT'D) If we're gonna convince the 90% to give a shit about us 10%... We have to let 'em know who we are. (his big new idea) Everybody's coming out. The entire state. No matter where they live. \nDICK PABICH \"Come out, come out, wherever you are!\" \nHARVEY MILK I'm serious. (beat, the room gets quiet) We're going to tell everyone in the state to come out. Every gay doctor, lawyer, teacher, dog catcher... We have to leave the ghetto, let all those people out there know that they do know one of us. And if people won't step out of the closet, we open the door for them. \nANNE KRONENBERG Jesus. \nSCOTT SMITH The whole state is not San Francisco. \nHARVEY MILK Clearly, Scott. \nJIM RIVALDO It could be dangerous. There is such a thing as a right to privacy. \n"}

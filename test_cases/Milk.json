{"test1_input": "HARVEY MILK Maybe a little. Or not. \nCLEVE JONES I went to Spain last month... long story. In Barcelona, there was this memorial march for gay people who died under Franco. The police tried to break it up. It started a riot. A bullet ripped through a drag queens scalp, his wig flew off, but he kept fighting. There was blood literally running in the gutter. \nHARVEY MILK We could have a revolution here too. But you can't just use the Castro to cruise. You gotta fight. \nCLEVE JONES You think you'll win? \nHARVEY MILK Winning isn't my strong suit. \nCLEVE JONES \n(BRAVADO) Well, I don't \"do\" losing. Ever. Maybe I should run for office, and you can work for me. (off Harvey's laugh) If you can do it, I can do it. \nHARVEY MILK Can you assemble a thousand people in an hour? \nCLEVE JONES Yeah, sure. \nHARVEY MILK All right, if I run again, you're my man. \nCLEVE JONES If...? \nHARVEY MILK Polls open in 3 hours. Lets hit the bus stops. \n54 EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - DAY \nHarvey is on the back of a motorcycle. The driver heads up Market Street. Folks stand in voting lines, flags outside of polling places. City Hall's tall dome grows nearer. \nHARVEY MILK (V.O.) And we lost that Assembly Race too, which made me a bona fide three- time, political loser. \n55 INT. CASTRO CAMERA - NIGHT \nCLOSE ON THE TV SET PLAYING A 1970's ORANGE JUICE COMMERCIAL featuring runner up to Miss America, ANITA BRYANT. \nANITA BRYANT (SINGING ON TV) \"Come to the Florida sunshine tree, great tasting orange juice naturally, orange juice with lots of vitamin c, from the Florida sunshine tree.\" Harvey is alone in the shop, surrounded by remnants of a celebration party that never happened. Jim Rivaldo lets himself into the store. Jim has his maps rolled up under his arm. \nJIM RIVALDO (trying to cheer up Harvey) We lost, but we lost by less! More votes than ever... (Harvey fake grins) I remember when that used to work. I want to show you something. This is remarkable. Jim starts laying out his trusty MAPS, color coded with precinct results from that night. \nJIM RIVALDO (CONT'D) The red is where you did best tonight. If we can get the initiative on district elections to pass, and we can -- we can -- our new Supervisor's District will go right up Market. Right around the Castro. \nThe district Jim outlines is ALL BRIGHT RED. \nJIM RIVALDO (CONT'D) If you run for Supervisor with this new district, it's a potential landslide. You'll be the first up- front gay man elected to major office in the U.S. \nHARVEY MILK I don't know if I have another one in me. Or Scott. But Harvey's gaze deceives his words. HOLD ON HARVEY - contemplating a FOURTH run for office. \n56 INT. CASTRO CAMERA - EVENING \nThe GROUP gathers around the TV WHICH SHOWS NATIONWIDE NEWS CLIPS OF ANITA BRYANT celebrating her election victory in Florida (overturning a pro-gay statute). A CHYRON READS: \"Landslide defeat for Florida Gay Rights Law.\" \nANITA BRYANT (ON TV) Tonight the laws of God and the cultural values of man have been vindicated. The people of Dade county, the normal majority, have said enough, enough, enough. \n57 INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - THE SAME NIGHT \nON THE TV: A REPORT ABOUT ANITA BRYANT'S VICTORY IN FLORIDA. \nTV REPORTER Gays in Florida can now be removed from their jobs and prosecuted if their \"deviant\" lifestyles are uncovered.

I can't talk right-- \nBOY'S VOICE Sir, I think I want to kill myself. \nHARVEY MILK No. You don't want to do that. \n(BEAT) Where do you live? \nBOY'S VOICE In Minnesota. \nHARVEY MILK You saw me in a paper in Minnesota? How'd I look? \nBOY'S VOICE My folks are taking me to this place tomorrow. A hospital. To fix me. \nHARVEY MILK There's nothing wrong with you. Listen to me. You don't have to hurt yourself, okay? Are you there? (only breathing from the other end) Here's what you have to do. Are you listening? \nBOY'S VOICE Yes. \nHARVEY MILK Get on a bus. Go to the next biggest city. New York, San Francisco, LA, or even Minneapolis. It doesn't matter. Just leave. (off the boy's tears) You won't be alone. There are people out here just like you who will welcome you and love you. \n(MORE) \nHARVEY MILK (CONT'D) You're not sick. You're not wrong. God does not hate you. Just leave. \nBOY'S VOICE I can't. \nHARVEY MILK Yes. You can. Just get on a bus. \nBOY'S VOICE I can't... I can't walk, sir. I'm in a wheelchair... Sir. Are you there? Harvey FORCES HIMSELF TO SOUND CALM... \nHARVEY MILK That's okay. It's going to be okay. Over the phone, Harvey hears the SOUND OF AN ADULT VOICE, someone finding the BOY on the phone, then... The LINE goes DEAD. It's all too much for Harvey. There's nothing a speech or a pep talk can do to fix this. Harvey is overwhelmed. Dick comes upstairs. \nDICK PABICH Harvey, you better come down. There's gonna be a riot. Moving in a daze, stunned by the call, Harvey digs out A BULLHORN and heads out. \n58 INT. CASTRO CAMERA - SAME \nFrom inside, SCOTT WATCHES HIS LOVER JUMPING BACK IN THE FREY. A weight hangs. He doesn't follow... \n58B INT. CASTRO STREET BAR - NIGHT \nCleve RUSHES into the bar (ON FIRE WITH RIGHTEOUS FURY) and BLOWS A POLICE WHISTLE to get everyone's attention. \nCLEVE JONES Out of the bar and into the streets! Anita Bryant is coming after you! \n59 EXT. CASTRO AND MARKET STREET - NIGHT \nAngry young men mill around the streets, their rage building. Someone TOSSES a trash can and it ROLLS. A POLICEMAN in riot gear comes up to Harvey. \nPOLICEMAN If you can't control em', we will. \n", "test1_id": 534, "test2_input": "JOHN BRIGGS My proposition promises to protect our children from these gay perverts and pedophiles who recruit our children to their deviant lifestyles, including the ones who \n(MORE) \nJOHN BRIGGS (CONT'D) do it in our public schools.

In the crowd is teacher TOM AMMIANO, 36, colorful, worked up: \nTOM AMMIANO And how are you going to determine who's a homosexual? \nJOHN BRIGGS Sir, my bill outlines procedures for identifying homosexuals. \nANOTHER PROTESTER How? Will you be sucking them off? \nJOHN BRIGGS Sir, you can argue with me, but you cannot argue with God. It's getting ugly fast. Briggs is whisked away by TWO OFFICERS. He trips off the curb and is quickly scooped up. \n90 INT. DAN WHITE'S HOME - DAY \nDan's house is filled with RELATIVES for a birthday celebration. Dan is glued to the NEWS, watching BRIGGS. Dan's RELATIVES gather around the TV. Mary Ann puts their BABY into Dan's arms and returns to wrangling kids. \nTHE COVERAGE CUTS TO HARVEY BEING INTERVIEWED: \nHARVEY MILK (ON TV) Look what happened in Germany. Now Anita Bryant already says that Jews and Muslims are going to hell, you know she's got a shopping list. We are not going to let John Briggs or Anita Bryant legislate bigotry in this city... Hold on Dan watching Harvey on TV. \n90B INT. UPSCALE SF HOUSE - NIGHT \nCleve and Anne sit in the entry way, Cleve in his tight jeans and shirt. He's very out of place amongst all the suits. Harvey walks in. Cleve and Anne rush to his side. David Goodstein and Rick Stokes turn to greet Milk. \nDAVID GOODSTEIN Hello, Harvey. Running late? (Harvey doesn't stop) \n(MORE) \nDAVID GOODSTEIN (CONT'D) Oh Harvey... your boyfriend is in the closet. \nHARVEY MILK Excuse me, David? \nRICK STOKES \n(QUIETLY) The Latino, he's locked himself in the coat room... Mr. Milk, Phil Burton is here. He's likely the next Speaker of the House and a much needed ally against Prop Six. We don't need a scene. \n90C INT. UPSCALE S.F. HOUSE / COAT ROOM DOOR - MOMENTS LATER \nHarvey is at the door. Jack is locked inside the room. \nHARVEY MILK You're right, I know, I was late by twenty minutes. I'm sorry, Jack. \nJACK LIRA (O.S.) Who were you with? Scott? Some boy? \nHARVEY MILK I was at work. Come out, sugar pea. \nJACK LIRA (O.S.) No. You embarrassed me. I didn't know anyone. These are not good people. I don't want to be here. \nHARVEY MILK Then go home, Jack. \nJACK LIRA (O.S.) No. I'll wait for you. Go away. A tight smile from Harvey as he looks up to Cleve. \n91 INT. UPSCALE S.F. HOUSE / STUDY - LATER \nHarvey, Cleve and a dozen others are scattered about the room for a meeting with the DEMOCRATIC PARTY ESTABLISHMENT. U.S. Congressman PHIL BURTON, 51, leans on a desk, listening. \nDAVID GOODSTEIN The Briggs initiative is polling at 75 percent for approval statewide. \n", "test2_true": "DAVID GOODSTEIN (condescending to Cleve) So it's important we not deceive people into thinking we can beat this, or we'll have riots and only increase this backlash. \nHARVEY JONES Good point, David. Let's just roll right over. Make it easier for Briggs to fuck us up the ass. Rick and David are horrified. Phil Burton rises above it, passing out copies of his new Anti-Briggs Initiative flier. \nPHIL BURTON We're taking this very seriously in my office. We want to send one of these to every home in California. We'll need money to do that. \nHARVEY MILK (reading the flier) \"Proposition Six is an affront to Human Rights. An invasion of the State into the private lives of California citizens.\" (points to the pictures) Does it even say the word gay on this thing? Anywhere? \nDAVID GOODSTEIN No Harvey, purposefully not. \nPHIL BURTON With the heat bearing down on your movement right now, we think it's best to dodge the \"gay\" bullet. Go for the human rights angle. \nHARVEY MILK People need to know who's affected. This flier needs at least one old queen on it. (a dig, to Goodstein) Why don't you volunteer for that, David? \nRICK STOKES (an olive branch) Corey Wares is an out gay-- \nDAVID GOODSTEIN (cutting Rick him off) \nRICK-- \nHARVEY MILK This is shit. Shit and masturbation. It's a coward's response to a dangerous threat. \nDAVID GOODSTEIN (a beat, then) I think you should leave. In the face of Phil Burton, most the others seem to agree. HARVEY PUTS PHIL BURTON'S FLYER IN THE FIREPLACE on his way out of the room. \n91B INT. UPSCALE SF HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER \nHarvey knocks on the coat check door. \nHARVEY MILK Jack, it's time to go. (to Cleve) Get everyone together. I want young people, women, fresh heads. Fighters and organizers, not politicians. \nCLEVE JONES (as if Jack can't spell) What about, S-C-O-T-T? OFF HARVEY, knowing Scott would be an asset. Jack opens the door and grabs Harvey's hand. They go. \n92 INT. CLEVE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nHarvey's clan is assembled (Jim, Dick, Mike, Cleve, Anne, Jack, Denis) along with fiery teacher Tom Amiano and MANY \nOTHER YOUNG ACTIVISTS. A HANDSOME PIZZA DELIVERY GUY is setting down boxes of pizzas. They're in for the night. The atmosphere is 180 degrees different from the previous stuffy meeting. \nCLEVE JONES We're not interested in working with those old Democratic Party shits. THE DOOR OPENS and someone new enters. He's HOLDING THE HAND OF... SCOTT SMITH. They are obviously a new couple. \nScott and his BOYFRIEND find a place on the floor. Harvey's and Scott's EYES MEET across the room. \nJIM RIVALDO But we can't afford infighting anymore, Cleve. We have to bring together every group. Even the old school Democrats. \nHARVEY MILK (taking over) Is anybody gonna pay the pizza guy, or are we just gonna stare? People start chipping in for the HANDSOME PIZZA GUY. \nHARVEY MILK (CONT'D) If we're gonna convince the 90% to give a shit about us 10%... We have to let 'em know who we are. (his big new idea) Everybody's coming out. The entire state. No matter where they live. \nDICK PABICH \"Come out, come out, wherever you are!\" \nHARVEY MILK I'm serious. (beat, the room gets quiet) We're going to tell everyone in the state to come out. Every gay doctor, lawyer, teacher, dog catcher... We have to leave the ghetto, let all those people out there know that they do know one of us. And if people won't step out of the closet, we open the door for them. \nANNE KRONENBERG Jesus. \nSCOTT SMITH The whole state is not San Francisco. \nHARVEY MILK Clearly, Scott. \nJIM RIVALDO It could be dangerous. There is such a thing as a right to privacy. \n", "test2_id": 535, "test3_input": "HARVEY MILK It could happen any day, any night, any time... (off the ROARING CROWD that's waiting for him) The nation's eye is on us. I have to do this. JUMP TO: POV shots of cops and loners amongst the massive audience hint at Harvey's paranoia. Like diving off a cliff, Harvey launches up to the microphone. The deafening cheers surely would have drowned \nout gunfire, but when it fades, He's standing. He delivers his impassioned call to action: \nHARVEY MILK (CONT'D) My name is Harvey Milk, and I want to recruit you. I want to recruit you for the fight to preserve your democracy. Brothers and sisters, you must come out. Come out to your parents. I know that it is hard and will hurt them but think about how they will hurt you in the voting booth! Come out to your friends, if they indeed are your friends. Come out to your neighbors, to your fellow workers. Once and for all, break down the myths, destroy the lies and distortions. For your sake. For their sake. For the sake of the youngsters who are becoming scared by the votes from Dade to Eugene. On the Statue of Liberty it says \"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to be free.\" In the Declaration of Independence it is written \"All men are created equal and are endowed with certain inalienable rights.\" For Mr. Briggs and Mrs. Bryant and all the bigots out there, no matter how hard you try, you cannot erase those words from the Declaration of Independence. No matter how hard you try, you cannot chip those words from off the base of the Statue of Liberty. That is what America is. Love it or leave it. Wild applause. He scans the crowd as he steps off stage. A bit surprised to still be alive. Cleve grabs him. \nCLEVE JONES The Mayor says Briggs is on his way here. He could intercept him for us. We could get him face to face. He couldn't ignore us anymore. \nHARVEY MILK Get the press. \n113 INT. LIMOUSINE / 5 BLOCKS FROM THE FREEDOM DAY PARADE - SAME \nJohn Briggs rides in a limo watching the \u00e2\u0080\u009cfreaks\" outside. As he nears the Parade Stages his POLICE ESCORTS take an unplanned turn. He leans forward. \nJOHN BRIGGS The parade is the other direction. \nDRIVER They're taking us another way, Sir. \n114 INT. WAREHOUSE ON THE PIER - MOMENTS LATER \nThe limo pulls in. Briggs cautiously steps out. Greeting him are Moscone, the POLICE CHIEF, 25 SFPD officers, a gaggle of press, and Harvey Milk. It's a showdown... HIGH NOON. \nJOHN BRIGGS I have a right to be here, Mr. Mayor. \nMAYOR MOSCONE I'm afraid it's not in the interest of your safety, or my public's safety to let you into that parade grounds. Finally face to face, Harvey extends his hand. Its a show for the FLASHING CAMERAS. Briggs is clearly uncomfortable. \nHARVEY MILK Hi, I'm Harvey Milk. It's quite an honor to meet you, Mr. Briggs. \nJOHN BRIGGS I'm aware. Sad you're too afraid to fight this out in public, Mr. Milk. \nHARVEY MILK No sir. I would love to have a public debate. I'm very interested in the details of your argument. \nJOHN BRIGGS You know the details. As do the people. Look at the votes across this nation. The \"public\" is with me. \nHARVEY MILK Yes sir, today they are. But with my City's Mayor and the San Francisco press as my witnesses, I'm challenging you to a public debate. John nods, stiff. He can no longer avoid Harvey Milk. He gets back in his limo. \nINT. SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT - (ON TV) 115 \nHarvey sits with John Briggs at a table facing forward. We hear the cheers and jeers of the packed audience. \nHARVEY MILK Senator, as a Christian it's interesting that you don't seem to understand what Christ was about. He was about accepting people and giving love, not carrying a Bible in one hand and hatred in the other... (cheers from the audience) ...Now all the gay myths have been shattered, all the fears, all the-- \nJOHN BRIGGS Not in my mind they haven't-- \nHARVEY MILK That's it. In your mind they haven't, and I'm wondering why-- \nJOHN BRIGGS Mr. Milk, we don't allow people who believe in practicing bestiality to teach our children, and the reason we don't is because it is illegal. But it's not illegal to be a homosexual in California. \nHARVEY MILK And your law goes even further. Any school employee who even supports a gay person will be fired-- \nJOHN BRIGGS True. But, gay people don't have children of their own. If they don't recruit our children, they'd all die away. That's why they want to be teachers, to encourage our children to join them. \nHARVEY MILK (ON TV) How do you teach homosexuality? Like French? I was born of heterosexual parents, I was taught by heterosexual teachers in a fiercely heterosexual society. So then why am I homosexual? And no offense meant, but if it were true that children mimicked their \n(MORE) \nHARVEY MILK (ON TV) (CONT'D) teachers, you'd sure have a helluva lot more nuns running around. The audience eats it up. It feel like \"The Harvey Milk Show.\" \n116 EXT. CITY HALL - DAY \n", "test3_true": "JOHN BRIGGS If they're going to lead such an open life of homosexuality that they want a 21-gun salute every time somebody goes by them, those people are going to be in danger of being removed their job. \n116B INT. FLASH FORWARD - HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT \nContinuing on with his recorded will... \nHARVEY MILK We were really genuinely frightened by Proposition Six, and with the backlash gaining strength, we were very pessimistic. We didn't think there was any chance we could beat it. What we hoped to do was to organize to the point that when we did lose, there would be a revolt... That all hell would break lose. \n117 INT. CITY HALL / HARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY \nHarvey, pacing, decisive. \nDICK PABICH People are coming out, though. We met with groups in Bakersfield, Redding, a dozen people showed up in a library basement in Fresno asking for our support if they came out. Last Sunday, the Reverend of St. Mary's came out to his entire congregation... \nHARVEY MILK We're still losing, 60 to 30. We have to take the show on the road. Call Briggs's office. Do a press release. Tell them he can pick the town, the audience, and I'll ask our supporters not to attend. \nDICK PABICH Their audiences are insanely devout. We'll get killed. \nHARVEY MILK Get me Orange County. \n118 INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nJack is FLIPPING OUT, storming around the place. \nJACK LIRA You just have to go down to LA and guess the right things on TV and they'll pay us... You have to use your fame now while you have it. We could have nice things. \nHARVEY MILK I don't have time to do game shows right now... This stops Jack cold. \nJACK LIRA You are horrible! I have worked on this surprise for you for weeks! \nHARVEY MILK Are you drunk right now? \nJACK LIRA You are an ungrateful asshole! \nHARVEY MILK Jack, I'll have more time soon. \nJACK LIRA You're ashamed of me! \nHARVEY MILK That's not true. I think you're smart. You're capable. No matter what your family or your father said. I believe in you... We should figure out something for you to do. I could get you a job. \nJACK LIRA I'll never be good enough for you! Jack THROWS A PIECE OF POTTERY AT HARVEY. It misses, CRASHING THROUGH THE WINDOW onto the street below. \nHARVEY MILK I'll get a broom. Harvey goes. Jack collapses into a chair. \n119 INT. AUDITORIUM IN ORANGE COUNTY - NIGHT \nTV CAMERAS ROLL. They've gotten their ORANGE COUNTY DEBATE! BRIGGS'S SUPPORTERS jeer Harvey as he rips into their State Senator. Their vehemence frightens Dick in the audience. Harvey lifts a Briggs flier. \nHARVEY MILK If in your statements here you say that child molestation is not an issue, why do you put out literature that hammers it home, why do you play on that myth and fear? \nJOHN BRIGGS Same thing with VD Harvey, we put out publications about VD so you can avoid it. \nHARVEY MILK (with a grin) But you've even admitted that there's more molestation in the heterosexual group! So why not get rid of the heterosexual teachers? Boos from the conservative audience. \nJOHN BRIGGS We are not talking about homos... child molestation, the fact is, at least 95 percent of the people are heterosexual. If we took heterosexuals out AND homosexuals out, you know what-- \nJOHN BRIGGS (CONT'D) HARVEY MILK --we'd have no teachers We'd have no teachers-- \nHARVEY MILK --No child molestation... So you're saying the percentage of population is equal to the percentage of child molestation? \n", "test3_id": 536}

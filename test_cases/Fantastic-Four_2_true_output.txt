Reed recognizes the voice.  So do we.  Doom turns to see... 
BEN GRIMM, AKA THE THING.  Back in rocky, fighting form. 
BEN IT'S CLOBBERING TIME! 
Doom turns, just as -- 
BAM!  Ben HITS Doom harder than any living thing has ever been hit.  The force sends Doom back through the air, toward the far wall, where he SMASHES into the massive "V" sculpture.  It SNAPS, crashing onto him.  A few sparks.  Then nothing. 
Nothing at all.  No more movement.  Doom is dead. 
Ben turns to Reed. 
BEN (CONT'D) Damn, I've been wanting to do that. 
Reed manages the thinnest smile as Ben starts disconnecting the tubes from Reed. 
BEN (CONT'D) (Reed's words) Victor's "not that bad," huh?  Just "a little larger than life"?  Maybe you'll listen to me next time before -- 
WHMM!  The WRECKAGE shifts.  They turn to see...Doom EMERGES. He stands, power coursing.  And he CHARGES at Ben!  Ben charges back.  And these two behemoths... 
SLAM INTO EACH OTHER, CRASHING THROUGH GLASS, INTO THIN AIR!! 
EXT. VON DOOM BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 
Doom and Ben PLUMMET, wrestling in mid-air.  On the ground, PEOPLE scream and duck for cover.  Doom and Ben SMASH through the large GLASS roof of a lower building across the street. 
INT. HOTEL - INDOOR POOL - CONTINUOUS 
BOOOOM!  Doom and Ben, locked in combat, drop through the glass, landing in a large HOTEL POOL.  People scream, run. 
INT. HOTEL - INDOOR POOL - NIGHT 
UNDERWATER: Doom and Ben LAND HARD.  Their combined weight CRACKS the floor of the pool.  A YOUNG BOY watches underwater through his MASK.  Doom and Ben square off, but... 
The CRACKS OPEN WIDER!  And they're PULLED toward the HOLE! WHOOSH!  The water is all sucked out of the hole.  The boy holds tight to a ladder, as Ben and Doom crash down to -- 
INT. HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT 
A HOTEL GUEST sees water FLOOD into the hall.  Roaring rapids head straight for him.  He jams his key into the lock, turning desperately, just barely leaping out of the way as the wave carrying BEN and DOOM SMASHES through a window to -- 
EXT. HOTEL - CONTINUOUS 
SMASH!  Ben and Doom fly out the window, thrashing in the TEN THOUSAND-GALLON WATERFALL TO -- 
EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - CONTINUOUS 
CRASH!  Water floods the street.  Doom and Ben land in a large GARBAGE TRUCK.  The truck rocks back and forth, DENTING from the inside.  Grunts, growls. 
CRASH!  The truck suddenly STOPS.  COP CARS SPEED CLOSER, sirens screaming.  And -- 
BOOM, A HUGE SHAPE explodes from the truck.  SMASH!  Ben lands on a CAR filled with two OLD LADIES -- his head cracks the WINDSHIELD.  Doom steps out of the garbage truck, water flooding the street around him.  COP CARS converge on Doom. 
Doom turns his attention to the cops.  His limbs SPARK with electricity, ready to fire at the cars. 
EXT./INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS 
Ben sees the cops and Doom.  He knows the cops are dead meat. He turns to the OLD LADY in the driver's seat. 
BEN Excuse me, Maam.  Can I borrow your car? 
She nods and quickly gets out, shaking. 
OLD LADY The clutch sticks a little. 
BEN Not gonna be a problem. 
Ben LIFTS the car and THROWS it at Doom.  WHMM!  It FLIES through the air, and WHAM!  Hits hard, knocking Doom back twenty feet!  As Doom FLIES back, a BUS enters frame, and -- 
EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - NIGHT 
BOOM!  Doom SMASHES into the OUT OF SERVICE BUS!  CRASH! Windows shatter.  The bus SLAMS into an ELECTRICITY POLE, snapping the pole.  Doom steps out, unharmed. 
Ben CHARGES toward him.  Doom grabs the broken ELECTRICITY POLE, FLIPS it into his hand, and wields the pole like a giant STUN-GUN!  Electric sparks FLY through the air into -- 
BEN!  The BLAST of VOLTS launches him off his feet!  He goes FLYING backward, ELECTROCUTED in mid-flight, and -- 
WHOOMPF!  Ben LANDS HARD, face down, CRATERING the street! Water rushes into the crater.  Ben lays there, incapacitated. 
EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - SAME TIME 
On the street, cars SCREAM to stops, people GASP.  Doom strides up to Ben, and raises the ELECTRICITY POLE for the death-blow.  Currents surge.  Right before he swings down -- 
VOICE (O.S.) I can't let you do that. 
Simple, strong.  Doom turns to see...REED.  Alone.  Bruised and battered.  Slowly stepping toward him.  Doom smiles. 
DOOM And you can't stop me. 
He turns back to Ben, raises the pole, but...he CAN'T SWING DOWN!  Something is HOLDING the pole in mid-air. 
Something invisible.

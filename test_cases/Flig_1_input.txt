CHARLIE puts the glass of water to WHIP's mouth. WHIP drinks. 
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) (snaps his fingers) Coco puff... 
HUGH hands HARLING the cigarette with a slightly hollowed out tip. HARLING leans over the coke with the cigarette in his mouth and hoovers up a small pile, sucking the coke through the cigarette. 
HARLING sits up, careful to keep the cocaine in the end of the cigarette. He tips it up and lights it. 
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) Little coco puff buddy. C'mon banana man. Who's the banana man? 
WHIP's head levels a look to Harling with a smile that leads us to believe that he is actually making a rally. 
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) Good man, focus up big dog. Here's the train comin' to you. 
HARLING takes a puff and holds it as he extends the cocaine cigarette to WHIP. WHIP is more nimble now as he cocks his head in acceptance of the cigarette. WHIP takes a drag and holds it. 
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) (still holding the smoke) Keep it down big dog, banana boat's comin' tell me the banana boat's comin'... 
WHIP finally exhales the smoke, HARLING does too. WHIP smiles. 
WHIP The banana boat is here. 
HARLING MAYS Nothing can keep you down dog. Nothing keeps the big dog down. 
CHARLIE Okay, we gotta go. 
HARLING has crafted 4 big lines now, he snorts one himself in record time. Looks to HUGH and CHARLIE. 
HARLING MAYS You guys are up. 
HUGH No, I'm good. Charlie? 
CHARLIE Are you fucking crazy? 
WHIP jumps in and sniffs 2 huge lines. He looks to HARLING. 
WHIP Thanks brother, I'm back. 
HARLING gathers his things, stands and hugs WHIP. 
HARLING MAYS I love you man. 
WHIP I love you too. 
HUGH and CHARLIE are quiet as they watch the strange but sincere drug-fueled emotion pass between two old friends. HARLING eyes CHARLIE before handing him a baggie. 
HARLING MAYS There's a gram in here, you paid for it and he might need it. My work here is done. See you all on the dark side of the moon. 
HARLING leaves and our TRIO exchange looks, "Did that just happen?" 
EXT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL -- GUEST HALLWAY -- DAY 
133 The opening bars of Joe Cocker's "Feelin' Alright" crackle 133 just before we see WHIP step out of the hotel room and begin a relatively steady strut down the hallway. Deja Vu. Sunglasses on, WHIP is backed by HUGH and CHARLIE who flank him from a few steps behind. Further back we can see that OFFICER EDWARDS also exits the room wearing latex gloves, carrying a large plastic garbage bag that obviously holds any evidence of the debauched night or the morning's resurrection. 
INT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL -- ELEVATOR -- DAY 
WHIP, HUGH and CHARLIE ride the elevator. WHIP is buttoning his shirt and fixing his tie. It is miraculous how the coke has revived him. A MOM and her 8 year old DAUGHTER get on the elevator. 
CHARLIE Morning. 
We watch as a small trickle of blood escapes from WHIP's left nostril. HUGH pulls a handkerchief from his pocket, hands it to WHIP. 
HUGH Your nose... 
WHIP accepts the handkerchief and wipes his nose. WHIP sees blood on the cloth and tilts his head back. 
We now see that there is a mirrored ceiling to the elevator. WHIP tries to study his reflection in the ceiling as he holds the hankie to his nose. WHIP begins to wobble and CHARLIE helps him regain his balance. 
INT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL-ELEVATOR LOBBY-MOMENTS LATER 
Our TRIO walk as tall as they can towards the hearing room. 
HUGH I'm gonna head in and tell Ellen Block that we're here. 
HUGH hustles off as CHARLIE pulls close to WHIP. 
CHARLIE You're gonna make it. Remember, if they ask about your drinking, it's totally acceptable to say, "I don't recall." 
WHIP wheels on CHARLIE and unloads with focused anger... 
WHIP Do not tell me how to lie about my drinking. I've been lying about my drinking my whole life. 
As we disappear in to WHIP's weary eyes we hear the distinctive sound of a jetliner screaming through the air. 
INT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL - BALL ROOM - NTSB HEARING-DAY 
On TWO LARGE SCREENS we watch the grainy cell phone footage shot by a witness of SOUTHJET FLIGHT 227's final moments in the sky. ACCOMPANYING the Video is the REAL AUDIO of the cockpit voice recording... 
The room has a dais where the NTSB board members sit. A large blue curtain is the backing for the round NTSB shield that hangs above the proceedings. A large drop down screen will show images, graph and text as needed by the NTSB. 
A confident woman, ELLEN BLOCK, approaches carrying a file which she lays on the podium. 
ELLEN BLOCK Those are difficult images to watch. For the record, I'm Ellen Block, Hearing Officer for this hearing. Captain Whitaker, good morning. 
We see WHIP who looks rough but stable in his witness chair. 
WHIP Morning. 
ELLEN BLOCK What was captured on that video is that the aircraft was in a relatively stable glide just prior to the moment of impact. However, according to the data we retrieved from the cockpit data recorders, at exactly 9:34, after flying 27 minutes without incident, the transponder recorded a loss in altitude in excess of 4800 feet per minute in what is considered a "full pitch nose down" attitude. Then at 9:42, according to the data recorders, a decision was made to invert the aircraft. The NTSB has created animated simulation that I would like to play at this point. 
ELLEN points to the screen...

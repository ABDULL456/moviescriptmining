{"test1_input": "Featuring the police. The sergeant wheels by the car with the civilian; his police turn their horses, lining up across the road again. \nTheir point of view. Gandhi and the miners coming on once more, chanting forcefully. \"One King! One Law! One King! One Law!\" \nSERGEANT What the hell are we supposed to do now? \nCIVILIAN (watching the procession narrowly) Let them march... In our own sweet time, in our own sweet way -- we'll get them. \nSMALL CHURCH - SOUTH AFRICA - INTERIOR - DAY \nWe are close on Charlie Andrews. \nCHARLIE Some of you may be rejoicing that Mr. Gandhi has at last been put into prison. \nThe congregation is listening to him stiffly, unsympathetically, and there is more than one murmur of assent at his words. The clergyman who has given Charlie the use of his pulpit sits beneath it, embarrassed, but sticking resolutely to his decision to give Charlie a hearing. \nCHARLIE But I would ask you -- assembled here in this house of God -- to recognize that we are witnessing something new, something so unexpected, so unusual that it is not surprising the Government is at a loss. What Mr. Gandhi has forced us to do is ask questions about ourselves. \nA few men in the congregation rise and pointedly escort their families from the church. Charlie struggles on. \nCHARLIE As Christians, those are difficult questions to answer. How do we treat men who defy an unjust law -- men who will not fight, but will not comply? \nMore of the congregation rise and march from the church... though a few pointedly do not. \nPRISON YARD - EXTERIOR - DAY \nSmall, packed. Gandhi is threading his way in a line for soup. But it is a line that winds through masses of prisoners, some with bowls, eating, some not yet in the line. \nAs Gandhi near the two stone blocks that hold the large barrels of soup, he sees that Khan is serving from one of them. He too wears a prison uniform and there is a bandage on his head. When he turns and reacts to the sight of Gandhi -- \nGANDHI They're sparing no one, I see. \nKHAN No. You were the surprise. It's been all over the prison. We thought they'd be too afraid of the English press. \nGANDHI So did I. \nHe takes his soup from Khan. \nKHAN (acidly) Don't worry about the meat -- it's Hindu (referring to the soup) -- there's not a trace. \nGandhi smiles, but they turn as the gate opens and a paddy wagon is backed into the press of prisoners. Khan shakes his head. \nKHAN I don't know who they've left out there to do the work. There can't be one mine left open. Have they touched the women? \nGANDHI My wife publicly defied the law. They've arrested her and four others. \nKHAN (angrily) The fools! (He spills some soup.) Sorry... \nGANDHI It's split the Government. \nKHAN Well, that's one victory. \nGandhi looks around the crowded yard at the soiled bandages, the defiant, determined faces. \nGANDHI If we hold firm, it won't be the last. \nKHAN Don't worry -- I've never seen men so determined. You've given them a way to fight... And I don't think -- \nHe is distracted by a phalanx of guards (an officer and four men) pushing their way through the prisoners. \nPRISON OFFICER Gandhi! I want Gandhi! Which sammy is it? \nThe prisoners are moving back from them resentfully but their glances reveal who Gandhi is. The prison officer's eyes fall on him. \nCITY STREET - JOHANNESBURG - EXTERIOR - DAY \nA side street, but active. Gandhi -- now manacled -- is being marched down the pavement before two guards. The prison officer strides in front of them. People in the street stop and turn, staring. That part of Gandhi that is still the dandy is discomfited, but there is a growing part of him that defies appearances. \nFeaturing a doorway. It is the side door of a large imposing building. The prison officer leads his little procession toward it. He knocks and the door opens. The tall civil servant has been waiting for them. The prison officer reaches forward and undoes Gandhi's manacles. \nGOVERNMENT BUILDING - INTERIOR - DAY \nThe tall civil servant, moving with aloof distaste for his assignment, walks ahead of Gandhi, who in turn is followed by one of the prison guards, toward a grand staircase that is at right angles to them (i.e. facing the front of the building). People working in offices pause to stare at Gandhi as he moves along, more uncomfortably aware of his prison garb than ever. \nThe grand staircase. The tall civil servant turns and starts up the staircase. Gandhi is even more exposed to everyone's surveillance on the wide, white expanse of the stairway. He hesitates, looking around in discomfort, then follows the tall civil servant on toward the large, white doors at the top of the staircase. \nSMUTS'S ANTEROOM - INTERIOR - DAY \nThe tall white doors open, the tall civil servant indicates that Gandhi enter. Gandhi passes two male secretaries, and the tall civil servant scoots decorously around him to knock once on the inner doors. Then he pushes them open and gestures Gandhi in. \nSMUTS'S OFFICE - INTERIOR - DAY \nWe have seen it before when Walker spoke to Smuts, but now we see its full breadth -- and the imposing figure Smuts makes as he stands behind the grand desk. \nSMUTS Ah, Mr. Gandhi. I thought we might have a little talk. \nHe nods to the tall civil servant, who bows and closes the door. Smuts crosses the room toward a small cabinet. \nSMUTS Will you have a glass of sherry? \nGANDHI Thank you. No. \nSmuts looks at Gandhi, a little surprised at the frigid tone of that refusal. \nSMUTS Perhaps some tea? \nGANDHI (a shake of the head) I dined at the prison. \nSMUTS Ahh. \nHe appraises Gandhi, measuring the irony of his words, his determination. Then with a little sigh at the lost opportunity he replaces the stopper on the sherry, turns and gestures Gandhi on into the room. \nSMUTS Please -- please do come and sit down. It's prison I wanted to talk to you about. \nHe has indicated a chair near his desk, but as Gandhi goes forward he pauses by a spread of papers from England on a long table near the middle of the room. We see one headline in close shot: \"Thousands Imprisoned in South Africa/Mines Close. Crops Unharvested,\" a subhead, \"Gandhi Leads Non- Violent Campaign.\" He looks at Smuts. Smuts smiles, a passing nod at the papers. \nSMUTS Mr. Gandhi, I've more or less decided to ask the House to repeal the Act that you have taken such \"exception\" to. \nGANDHI (a beat) Well, if you ask, General Smuts, I'm sure it will be done. \nSmuts smiles. \nSMUTS Hm. Of course it is not quite that simple. \nGANDHI Somehow I expected not. \nA wry smile, and he sits on the edge of the chair Smuts has directed him to. Smuts measures him again, not absolutely certain how to deal with him. A pause, and he affects to take Gandhi's irony at face value. \n", "test1_true": "GANDHI Very well. \nAnd Gandhi does understand it -- as a guiding principle. Never humiliate your enemy. And his tone conveys it. \nSMUTS (a bit surprised) Good. Good. (The bland politician: the compromise.) I have thought of calling for a Royal Commission to \"investigate\" the new legislation. (He gestures, implying they'll do what they're told.) I think I could guarantee they would recommend the Act be repealed. \nGANDHI (waiting for the catch) I congratulate them. \nSmuts does a slight double take, a smile, then the \"tough\" politician. \nSMUTS But they might also recommend that future Indian immigration be severely restricted -- even stopped. \nHe measures Gandhi challengingly, obviously expecting some contest. Gandhi mulls it, then \nGANDHI Immigration was not an issue on which we fought. It would be wrong of us to make it one now that we -- we are in a position of advantage. \nSmuts stares at him... a moment, then \nSMUTS You're an extraordinary man. \nGANDHI (his grin; he brushes at his prison garb) I assure you I feel a very ordinary man at this moment. \nAnd now Smuts smiles with him. He bends suddenly and signs a group of documents. \nSMUTS I'm ordering the release of all prisoners within the next twenty- four hours. You yourself are free from this moment. \nGandhi stands, a little uncertain about the sudden change in his status. Smuts signs the last document, then sees Gandhi's doubt -- and misreads it. \nSMUTS Assuming we are in agreement? \nGANDHI Yes -- yes. It's just that... in these clothes I'd -- I'd prefer to go by taxi. \nSMUTS (confused by his hesitation) All right. Fine. \nGANDHI I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money. \nSMUTS Oh! (He quickly feels in his waistcoat pockets -- and realizes he has no money!) Neither have I. (He reaches forth and touches a buzzer.) I'm awfully sorry. \nThe tall civil servant (Daniels) enters. \nSMUTS Daniels, would you lend Mr. Gandhi a shilling for a taxi? \nDaniel stares. \nDANIELS I beg your pardon, sir? \nSMUTS (a second thought) How far will you be going, Mr. Gandhi? \nGANDHI (a mischievous smile) Well -- now that this is settled -- I had thought seriously of going back to India (he faces the startled Daniel) but a shilling will do splendidly for the moment. \nStill a little confused, Daniels reaches in his pocket and produces a shilling. He hands it to Gandhi. \nGANDHI Thank you. (To Smuts) Thank you both for a very enlightening experience. \nHe bows slightly and starts out the door. Daniels immediately starts to accompany him, but Gandhi stops. A beat. \nGANDHI (ice) I'm obliged, Mr. Daniels, but I will find my own way out. \nAnd his own steel shows in the oblique reference to the ignominy of his way in. Daniel bows, and he and Smuts just stare as the uniformed \"prisoner\" goes out through the grand doors, past the stunned men in the office to the outer doors and on to the grand staircase. The prison guard appears in the doorway, looking off in confusion at Gandhi, then back at the office for guidance. Daniels simply shakes his head \"Let him be.\" \nFinally, when Gandhi has disappeared down the stairs, Daniels turns to Smuts. \nSMUTS (a shake of the head) He's either a great man or a colossal fraud... Either way, I shall be glad to see the last of him. \nTHE PIER AT BOMBAY - EXTERIOR - DAY \nShip's siren, military band... a jubilant crowd on the pier, passengers waving to the receiving crowd. A group of First Class passengers, ninety percent English, look down from the upper deck. \nFrom their point of view. We see the main section of the pier, a crowd of mostly European civilians on one side. A mass of military on the other: European officers, topees and swagger sticks, Indian cavalry, Gurkha infantry, Sikh lanoers -- turbans, rifles, bugles, an Indian military band -- a showy awe-inspiring display. \nFeaturing two Englishmen. First Class passengers, white suits, Oxbridge accents; one quite young, the other a bit older, both civil servants coming to \"administer\" India. \nYOUNG ENGLISHMAN By God, he loves it... \nTheir point of view. A British general is coming down the gangplank accompanied by his ADC. The officer commanding and the Guard of Honor await him. \nSECOND ENGLISHMAN I'm sure he hates it. \nThe young Englishman glances at him quizzically. The General has taken the salute and moves to inspect the troops to the accompaniment of the military band. \nSECOND ENGLISHMAN Generals' reputations are being made in France today, fighting on the Western Front. Not as Military Governors in India. \nHe is suddenly aware of a well-dressed Indian half-listening to their conversation. He glances at him and the well-dressed Indian simply nods slightly and moves off a little. The second Englishman grimaces at the young Englishman and looks down again. \nSECOND ENGLISHMAN What the devil's going on back there? \nHe is looking aft. His point of view. \nAnother far less elaborate gangplank extends from the aft section of the ship. Third Class passengers are disembarking here, and on shore, separated by a wire fence from the rest of the pier. A large crowd of Indians is reacting excitedly to someone coming down the gangplank but we can't yet see that person. \nThe young Englishman glances back at the well-dressed Indian to make sure of his distance, then speaks quietly. \nYOUNG ENGLISHMAN It must be that Indian that made all that fuss back in Africa. My cabin boy told me he was on board. \nSECOND ENGLISHMAN Why haven't we seen him? (Finding the name) Gandhi? \nYOUNG ENGLISHMAN Yes. That's it. He was traveling Third Class. There he is. \nTheir point of view. \nThere has been a little hiatus in those disembarking but now Gandhi has appeared, coming down the gangplank with Ba and the children (grown-up sons now), and three or four people behind them, including the tall figure of Charlie Andrews. But Gandhi is wearing an Indian tunic and sandals and he has shaved his hair except for a central section on the top. \nSECOND ENGLISHMAN'S VOICE-OVER God -- he's dressed like a coolie! I thought he was a lawyer. \nThe young Englishman glances back cautiously toward the well- dressed Indian again, then \nYOUNG ENGLISHMAN After he came out of jail he refused to wear European clothes. \nTHE PIER - THIRD CLASS AREA - EXTERIOR - DAY \nGandhi is smiling, trying to move on, but answering the questions of an Indian journalist. \nGANDHI No, no, I haven't \"refused\"... I -- I simply wanted to dress the way my comrades in prison dressed. \nHe speaks with an uncertainty and tentativeness that he had lost in South Africa, patently overwhelmed by the reception. An English journalist catches him as he turns. \n", "test1_id": 2031, "test2_input": "Gandhi and Charlie step back. And as the troop goes past we see from their point of view a group of Indian bearers, trotting in the middle of the horsemen, carrying two litters -- covered, each hanging by straps from a long pole -- and each bearing a badly wounded British soldier; one appears to be dead. \nOUTSKIRTS OF VILLAGE - EXTERIOR - DAY \nThe shadow of a train moves slowly along the ground, a sense of tension and foreboding. We hear the engine chugging slowly. The camera lifts. Gandhi and Charlie stand at a window, staring out grimly. Other passengers are looking off too. Ba is seated, staring straight ahead, her face taut, deliberately not seeing what the others are seeing. \nGALLOWS - EXTERIOR - DAY \nTheir point of view: On a hill across from the railroad track part of a prison wall is visible. In front of it a thick pole is straddled across two others. From this crude gallows two Indian men hang by the neck. One is in turban and dhoti, the other in a tunic. The sound of the train stopping. \nVILLAGE - EXTERIOR - DAY \nClose shot. Incense rising in shot. The camera pulls back and back. The incense is burning in a bowl sitting before Gandhi on a make-shift platform set in the little valley between the train line and the little hill where the Indian men have been hanged. A small crowd sits in a crescent before him, Ba and Charlie are bent in prayer on the platform behind him. When the camera comes to rest, the edge of the gallows and a portion of one of the hanged men is in the frame. We know we are looking from someone's point of view near the prison wall. \nFinally, Gandhi lifts his head. \nGANDHI (at first distant, as from the hill) I ask you to pray for those who died. (Closer) For the English soldiers... (a murmur) who were doing what they thought was right. (Closer) And for the brave terrorists whose patriotism led them to do what was wrong. \nThe murmur of resistance from the crowd is louder at this. Gandhi shakes his head at the dissent. \nGANDHI It is not my law, it is the law of creation. We reap what we sow. Out there in the fields -- and in our hearts. Violence sows hatred, and the will to revenge. In them. And in us. \nHe looks up. \nHILLSIDE - HIS POINT OF VIEW \nThe troop leader, on horseback, is on the hill beside the gallows. The first view of Gandhi on the platform was his. Some of his troops are lined up beside him. He stares down at Gandhi coldly. \nPATEL'S SWIMMING POOL - EXTERIOR - DAY \nPatel lounges in the water on his back, supported by a large air pillow. Nehru sits at the side of the pool in a swimming suit, his feet dangling in the water. Jinnah sits under an umbrella in an elegant white suit, being served tea by one of three or four servants around. Patel spews a fountain of water. \nPATEL I agree with Jinnah. Now that the Americans are in, the war will end soon. The Germans are worn out as it is... (he rolls over, facing Nehru) and our first act should be to convene a Congress Party convention and demand independence. \nNehru takes an iced drunk from a servant. \nJINNAH And we must speak with one voice -- united. \nThe others assent. Nehru shakes his head wistfully. \nPATEL (it reminds him) Ah -- we should invite Gandhi. What the devil has happened to him anyway? \nNEHRU He's \"discovering\" India. \nJINNAH (cynically) Which is a lot better than causing trouble where it matters. Invite him -- let him say his piece about South Africa -- and then let him slip into oblivion. \nCUT TO: \nTRAIN - EXTERIOR - DAY \nA fireman heaps coal into an engine's boiler. \nThe train passes camera to the Third Class section, which seems besieged by humanity. People cling to the outside of each door and many more are seated on the central wooden planks on the roofs of the two coaches. \nTHIRD CLASS COACH - EXTERIOR - DAY \nGandhi and Charlie are riding on the outside of the coach, hanging on through the door, and both enjoying it immensely. Ba, inside the jammed coach, finds it very unfunny. She has a grip on one of Gandhi's arms. \nBA (quietly, private) Please! You're being foolish! \nGANDHI There's no room! And the air is lovely. \nShe grimaces severely and tugs at him. \nCHARLIE No violence, please. \nGANDHI Let me hang on with two hands or I will fall. \nFeaturing the roof. And Indian squats right on the edge of the roof above Charlie. He is looking down, offering a hand. \nINDIAN (over the sound of the engine) Englishman Sahib! \nCharlie, who has been grinning, suddenly looks baffled, not to say appalled. \nINDIAN Come! Come! There is room! \nHis hand still dangles in offering to the tall Charlie. \nAnother angle. Two other Indians on the roof move to where they can grip the first Indian's other arm, as counterforce to the weight of Charlie. \nFIRST INDIAN (to Charlie) Place the foot on the window. \nFeaturing Charlie. Hesitatingly, he grips the inside of the window higher, and starts to swing one foot onto the window ledge. \nGANDHI (amused, but disconcerted) What are you doing? \nCHARLIE (grimly) Going nearer to God! \nGandhi, baffled a second, sees the outstretched hand above them, and in puckish complicity, helps boost Charlie up. \nLong shot. As Charlie reaches up, his hand is grasped and he starts to scramble and be pulled up to the roof. \nFeaturing Gandhi and Ba. As Charlie's leg, assisted by Gandhi, starts to leave its lodging on the window ledge Ba suddenly turns, sees it, and grabs for it in alarm. \nBA Charlie! Be careful!! \nClose shot. Charlie. His face flat on the roof of the train as his arm is still gripped by the Indian, but his leg is being pulled from behind. \nCHARLIE (desperately) Mohan -- !! \nResume Gandhi and Ba. Gandhi quickly moves to free Ba's hand from Charlie's leg and almost loses his own grip. \nHe grabs the window again. \nGANDHI Let go! You'll kill him! \nBa is confused. \nGANDHI Let go! Let go! \nWith one hand he pries at her grip. In the chaos of instructions others in the coach are helping Gandhi, and Ba senses she is doing something wrong, but is still not sure what. She lets go. \nClose shot. Charlie. A desperate sigh of relief. \nLong shot. Charlie is pulled on up to the top of the coach. \nFeaturing Charlie as he sits, puffing and recovering from the fright. \n", "test2_true": "Charlie nods grimly. \nFeaturing Gandhi and Ba. Gandhi, smiling, goes on the tips of his toes to get a better view. Ba grabs him desperately. \nBA Please, God, no! \nFeaturing Charlie. He looks around at the rest of the passengers on the roof, their bundles and baskets clutched beside them. Their poverty is appalling, but they are all smiling at him, a sense of gaiety made in part by his Englishman's participation in their experience. They must shout over the train. \nSECOND INDIAN (grinning) Are you Christian, Sahib? \nCHARLIE (nods) Yes, yes, I'm a Christian. \nSECOND INDIAN (proudly) I know a Christian. (Charlie acknowledges it politely.) She drinks blood. \nCharlie stares at him in surprise. \nSECOND INDIAN (explaining -- obvious) The blood of Christ -- every Sunday! \nHe is nodding, smiling, expecting Charlie's understanding. And Charlie gives it -- somewhat bleakly. Suddenly \nGANDHI'S VOICE (alarmed) Charlie!! \nThe Indians turn. Charlie turns. \nTRAIN AND TUNNEL - EXTERIOR - DAY \nResume Charlie and the Indians. \nFIRST INDIAN It's all right, Sahib! Very safe -- bend -- bend! \nAll the Indians are crouching. Charlie closes his eyes ruefully -- he's had better ideas than this -- and he gets as flat as he can. \nTRAIN AND TUNNEL - EXTERIOR - DAY \nThe train, with passengers clinging to the sides and riding on the top, steams into the tunnel, its whistle sounding. \nTHE TUNNEL \nBlack. A glimmer of light, through steam, the whistle echoing. \nINDIAN'S VOICE Pray to God, Sahib! Now is when it is best to be Hindu! \nClose shot. Charlie. In a flash of steamy light, staring wide-eyed at the Indian. \nBlack, and sudden silence. \nAND WE DISSOLVE THROUGH TO: \nCONVENTION TENT - INTERIOR - DAY \nHigh. Coming into focus is a lighted platform, and as the scene becomes clearer we see figures on the platform and the banner which reads INDIAN NATIONAL CONGRESS, and we hear the emotional voice of Jinnah at the microphone. \nJINNAH (gradually fading in) We were asked for toleration. We were asked for patience. Some gave it and some did not. Well, their war is over! And those of us who supported it, and those of us who refused must forget our differences! \nThe camera has been moving in; now it jumps to Jinnah in close shot and intercuts with the impact of his fervid delivery on the audience. \nJINNAH And there can be no excuses from the British now! India wants Home Rule! India demands Home Rule!! \nAnd the audience cheers him. Newspaper cameramen crowded around the platform photograph him. Patel comes forward from the back of the platform, clapping. He is chairing the Congress. Jinnah bows, taking his notes, gesturing to the auditorium. A man made for the spotlight, a man loving the spotlight. \nAt last he moves back to his place on the platform. Nehru clasps his hand in congratulation. Others crowd around him. And fleetingly, just in the edge of picture, we see Gandhi -- again, the only one in an Indian tunic -- sitting at the end of the second row on the platform. He is just watching the flood of enthusiasm for Jinnah. \nFeaturing Patel approaching the microphone, stilling the house with upraised hands. \nPATEL And let no one question that Mr. Jinnah speaks not just for the Muslims -- but for all India! \nAnd again the audience cheers and applauds his little coda. He raises his hands, stilling them again. \nPATEL And now I'm going to introduce to you a man whose writings we are all becoming familiar with... a man who stood high in the esteem of our beloved Professor Gokhale... a man whose accomplishment in South Africa will always be remembered. Mr. Mohandas Gandhi. \nGandhi has already started to come toward the podium. He is greeted with mild applause, but already the convention is performing like a convention now that the spell of Jinnah's major speech has dissipated. As Gandhi reaches the podium, Patel gestures him to it. \nPATEL (politely) Your journal has made a great impact. \nGandhi nods to him and acknowledges the residue of applause. \nGANDHI I am flattered by Mr. Patel (His grin.) I would be even more flattered if what he said were true. \nHe means about the journal. \nPatel has wandered back toward the others, his mind already on them. But he has half heard Gandhi's comment and turns -- a smile, a politician's flexibility -- \nPATEL (loudly; he is away from the mike) But it's true! I -- I read it... often. \nAgain Gandhi grins -- and takes glasses from his sleeve. This is the first time we have seen them. He has one slip of paper with notes on it which he has put on the podium. He puts his glasses on and faces the convention. \nGANDHI Since I returned from South Africa, I have traveled over much of India. And I know I could travel many more years and still only see a small part of it. \nOn the platform, the whispered politics go on. On the floor of the convention, some listen, some talk of other things. \nGANDHI ...and yet already I know what we say here means nothing to the masses of our country. \nNehru has turned, having caught that last remark. He touches Patel on the shoulder \"Listen.\" \nGANDHI Here we make speeches for each other -- and those English liberal magazines that may grant us a few lines. \nAnd now they are beginning to pay attention on the floor of the hall too. \nGANDHI But the people of India are untouched. Their politics are confined to bread and salt. \nJinnah too is listening now -- aloofly, challengingly. \nGANDHI Illiterate they may be, but they are not blind. They see no reason to give their loyalty to rich and powerful men who simply want to take over the role of the British in the name of freedom. \nThere is dissent on the floor and on the platform -- but it is muttered and English \"polite.\" Gandhi goes on. \nGANDHI This Congress tells the world it represents India. My brothers, India is seven hundred thousand \"villages\" not a few hundred lawyers in Delhi and Bombay. Until we stand in the fields with the millions who toil each day under the hot sun, we will not represent India -- nor will we ever be able to challenge the British as one nation. \nHe takes off his glasses and folds them and in silence starts back toward his place on the platform. A cameraman flashes a picture, and someone begins to applaud; it is taken up here and there, tepidly. On the platform, the leaders join in perfunctorily. We see one peasant face (Shukla) -- which we will come to know -- watching from the crowd of outsiders who stand in the doorways. \nNehru, who has been looking at Gandhi with interest and some surprise turns to Patel. \nNEHRU Have you read his magazine? \nPATEL No -- but I think I'm going to. \n", "test2_id": 2032, "test3_input": "He has looked up. A car is pulling hurriedly in near the clubhouse, an officer in it, and people are streaming toward it. \nThe car. A major is standing on the back seat. An Indian corporal drives. \nMAJOR ...I've got no idea. All I know is there's a riot or something at Motihari in Champaran, and the whole company is ordered out. \nA VOICE It's two days' march! \nMAJOR That's why the match is off. It's mostly Muslim territory and the old man's taking no chances. \nFeaturing the batsman and some of the players as they walk across the field toward the car. They know something's up. \nBATSMAN (disgusted) God, and it's the best innings I've had since Oxford. \nWICKET KEEPER (dryly) India's full of grief, old man. \nThe batsman \"takes\" on him facetiously, and we cut to: \nTHE COURTHOUSE AND JAIL - MOTIHARI - EXTERIOR - DAY \nA small building on a little Anglicized square. It is surrounded by a milling angry throng of peasants. \nFeaturing the front entrance. The English captain who was at the station when Gandhi arrived is on the top step, looking harried and tense. A small detachment of Indian troops lines the step below him. Charlie Andrews is pushing through the crowd toward the captain. As he approaches, the Indian sergeant holds up his hand. \nCHARLIE (firmly) I wish to see the prisoner, please. \nThe captain looks at his clerical collar, his English face, his determination. \nCAPTAIN (reluctantly) All right, Sergeant. \nCharlie moves through the Indian soldiers and up toward the entrance. The captain stares out worriedly over the unruly crowd. \nCOURTHOUSE JAIL - INTERIOR - DAY \nA basement chamber -- dark, thick-walled and poorly lit. The camera has panned off a close shot of Gandhi as he turns in his cell at the sound of a door opening and approaching footsteps. We have seen only his head and shoulders, which are covered in a shawl. \nA police guard leads Charlie across the rough, unfinished floor. As he comes to Gandhi's cell we get a fleeting glimpse of Gandhi sitting on a low pallet bed. \nClose shot. Gandhi as he recognizes his visitor. \nGANDHI Charlie-- \nReverse on Charlie. He looks down at Gandhi and shakes his head. \nCHARLIE (a somber grin) ...Shades of South Africa. \nClose shot. Gandhi. Head and shoulders. He returns the grin, but anger and determination still dominate his mood. \nGANDHI Not quite. They're only \"holding me\" until the Magistrate's hearing. Then it will be prison. \nCHARLIE (sympathetically) Did they take your clothes? \nAnd now we see Gandhi in full shot for the first time. He is wearing only a white loincloth, the shawl over his shoulders and sandals -- the costume he will wear for the rest of his life. \nGANDHI These are my clothes now. \nCharlie studies him a moment, and being Charlie, he understands. \nCHARLIE (affectionately) You always had a puritanical streak, Mohan. \nHe grins, and it elicits a little grin from Gandhi. \nGANDHI (in a tone of defensiveness) If I want to be one with them, I have to live like them. \nCHARLIE I think you do. (A smile.) But I thank God we all don't. \nAnd Gandhi laughs. \nGANDHI I'm sure your legs are quite as handsome as mine. \nCHARLIE Ah, but my puritanism runs the another way. I'm far too modest for such a display. \nAnd again Gandhi laughs. Charlie turns to the guard. \nCHARLIE Couldn't I be let in with the prisoner? I am a clergyman. \nThe police guard hesitates, and then unlocks the cell. \nCharlie enters and sits on a little wooden stool opposite Gandhi, his long legs awkwardly filling most of the space between them. Gandhi has remained seated, pensive. Charlie studies him a moment. \nCHARLIE (a bit puzzled) They're calling you \"Bapu.\" I thought it meant father. \nGANDHI (wistfully) It does. We must be getting old, Charlie. \nA little grin, but his mood remains pensive -- and remote. \nCHARLIE What do you want me to do? \nGandhi looks up -- his anger, his determination there, but then broken by a hopeless sigh. \nGANDHI I think, Charlie, that you can help us most by taking that assignment you've been offered in Fiji. \nCharlie is stunned, and obviously hurt. Gandhi proceeds more gently. \nGANDHI I have to be sure -- they have to be sure -- that what we do can be done by Indians... alone. \nAnd now Charlie understands. Gandhi smiles; warmth, and sadness. Then he speaks with a determined purposefulness, a friend's trust. \nGANDHI But you know the strategy. The world is full of people who will despise what's happening here. It is their strength we need. Before you go, you could start us in the right direction. \nHe has taken some scratched notes from under the bedding and handed them to Charlie. Charlie nods. He sighs, and rises slowly. \nCHARLIE I must leave from Calcutta, and soon. You'll have to say goodbye to Ba for me. \nGandhi rises, glancing wryly at the prison walls. He nods. \nGANDHI When I get the chance. \nAnd now he faces Charlie; this is the moment of farewell. \nCHARLIE Well, I -- \nHe doesn't know what to say, how to say it. Gandhi meets his eyes -- a smile that shelters Charlie's vulnerability, returns his love. \nGANDHI There are no goodbyes for us, Charlie. Wherever you are, you will always be in my heart... \nThe very English, very steadfast Charlie fights to contain his emotions. \n", "test3_true": "It is packed to overflowing; restless. Gandhi sits in the dock. One or two sergeants-at-arms are trying to keep order, but it the uneven and menacing chanting of \"Gandhi... Gandhi\" coming from the mobs outside the courtroom that fills the atmosphere with threat. \nThe magistrate (English) is surveying the courtroom; he signals his clerk (English) to him. \nMAGISTRATE (whispered conference) I am going to clear the courtroom. \nCLERK (politely) I'm not sure we'd be able to. And it is a first hearing, it's supposed to be public. And he's a lawyer. \nThe magistrate frowns. \nMAGISTRATE (worried, angry) I don't know where they found the nerve for all this. \nCLERK I'm sure I don't either, but the troops won't be here until tomorrow. \nMAGISTRATE How the press get here before the military? \nWe see the front row from his point of view. Two or three Indian journalists and one European. \nCLERK That English clergyman sent a number of telegrams yesterday afternoon. I understand one of them even went to the Viceroy. \nThe magistrate receives that news with some alarm. He indicates that the clerk take his place. \nGandhi stands. The courtroom is silent, but we can still hear the sound of the chanting outside. \nMAGISTRATE You have been ordered out of the province on the grounds of disturbing the peace. \nGANDHI (defiantly) With respect, I refuse to go. \nThe magistrate stares. The journalists write. The clerk swallows. \nThe magistrate looks around the courtroom and is only too aware of the mob outside. \nMAGISTRATE (sternly) Do you want to go to jail? \nGANDHI (not giving him an inch) As you wish. \nThe clerk lowers his eyes to his pad. The magistrate searches the distant wall, the top of his desk, his twitching hands for an answer. Finally \nMAGISTRATE (as much sternness as he can muster) All right. I will release you on bail of one hundred rupees until I reach a sentence. \nGANDHI I refuse to pay one hundred rupees. \nAgain the magistrate stares. And so do the journalists. The magistrate wets his lips -- \nMAGISTRATE Then I -- I will grant release without bail -- until I reach a decision. \nAnd now the court explodes. In the chaos of cheering and delight, the magistrate rises, looks around the room and heads for his chambers. \nThe journalists are scribbling furiously. \nGandhi turns and starts out of the courtroom. We hear cries of \"Gandhi! -- Gandhi! -- Bapu!\" \nTHE COURTHOUSE BALCONY \nGandhi steps down from the courtroom to the balcony. A huge cheer comes up from the massed peasants below. As he smiles down at them, he is turned by \nA VOICE Gandhiji! -- Gandhiji! Mr. Gandhi! \nFour young Indians -- elegantly dressed in English clothes -- are following him, having plunged through the crowd in the courtroom. A beat -- and the first young man addresses him over the chaos. \nFIRST YOUNG MAN (his accent is as refined as his clothes) Gandhiji -- we are from Bihar. We received a cable this morning from an old friend who was at Cambridge with us. (A smile.) His name is Nehru and I believe you know him. \nGandhi reacts -- with surprise and caution. \nGANDHI Indeed. \nFIRST YOUNG MAN He tells us you need help. And we have come to give it. \nAgain Gandhi is surprised -- but even more cautious. Behind him, the crowd begins to chant \"Gandhi -- Gandhi.\" \nGANDHI I want to document, coldly, rationally, what is being done here. It may take months -- many, many months. \nFIRST YOUNG MAN (they're eager, impressed) We have no pressing engagements. \nIt sounds casually ironic, but they look determined, even angry. \nGANDHI You will have to live with the peasants. (They nod.) I have nothing to pay you. (They only smile.) Hmm. \nHe is looking at them with a soup\u00e7on of skepticism but he is beginning to smell victory. His name echoes around him and is taken up even louder as the news spreads to the street. \nGOVERNOR'S OFFICE - CHAMPARAN - INTERIOR - DAY \nAlmost total silence. The room is long, large and imposing -- hardwood floors, overhead fans, an aura of wealth and permanence. Footsteps pace its acres of space... and Sir George Hodge comes into frame. He is rich, middle-aged, Tory -- and at the moment feeling impotent and harried. \nSIR GEORGE I don't know what this country is coming to! \nThe Governor, Sir Edward Gait -- the portrait of the King prominent behind him -- is feeling as cornered as Sir George but for different reasons. His desk is arrayed with several tall stacks of folders -- all with exactly the same covers -- and on one corner of the desk, some folded newspapers. We can just read \"Gandhi\" in a headline. He taps one of the folders irritably with his hand. \nSIR EDWARD But good God, man, you yourself raised the rent simply to finance a hunting expedition! \nSir George looks at him -- half defensive, half defiant. They are old friends -- the same school, the same social class, long together in India -- and their argument is an argument between friend who accept the same premises. But even so the Governor feels the game has not quite been played fairly. \nSIR EDWARD And some of these others -- (he gestures to the folders again) beatings, illegal seizures, demanding services without pay, even refusing them water! In India!... \nSir George is staring out of the window, vexed, bristling but defensive. \nSIR GEORGE Nobody knows what it is to try to get these people to work! \nSIR EDWARD Well, you've make this half-naked whatever-he-is into an international hero. \nHe picks up one of the papers irritatedly, the London Daily Chronicle. \nSIR EDWARD \"One lone man marching dusty roads armed only with honesty and a bamboo shaft doing battle with the British Empire.\" (He lowers the paper dismally; then the ultimate bitterness) At home children are writing \"essays\" about him. \nSir George looks at him and sighs heavily. Sir Edward stares back, then drops the paper back on his desk. \nSIR EDWARD I couldn't take another two years of him to save my life. \nSir George turns, and paces back toward him. For the first time we see Sir Edward's personal secretary (a male civil servant) sitting at a small desk and listening with highly developed unobtrusiveness. \nSIR GEORGE What do they want? \nIt is the first sign of concession. Sir Edward lifts his eyes to his personal secretary. \nPERSONAL SECRETARY (reading precisely from a document) A rebate on rents paid. (Sir George huffs.) They are to be free to grow crops of their own choice. A commission -- part Indian -- to hear grievances. \n", "test3_id": 2033}

DR. CARTER Ed Kelly.    I thought we might get a bite -- 
LANDON Not hungry. 
Landon moves toward his Camaro. 
DR. CARTER Landon! Please. Don't walk away from me. 
LANDON Like you walked away from us? 
Landon opens his car door and gets in.         Not forgiving. 
INT. BEAUFORT HIGH - CORRIDOR - NEXT MORNING 
Landon waits by Jamie's locker.       The BELL RINGS.   No Jamie. 
INT. CAFETERIA - NOON 
Landon walks along the lunch line, looking.        No Jamie. 
INT. LIBRARY - LATER 
Many many books. Landon cruises the stacks. No Jamie. Belinda, sitting at a table with a girlfriend, sees Landon and turns away. He doesn't pursue it. 
EXT. CARTER DRIVEWAY - DUSK 
Eric and Clay watch Landon hammer out dents in the Camaro. They're smoking, sharing some beers. Josh, the neighbor kid, stands across the street, wanting to be invited over. 
ERIC (contemptuous) She's like some Puritan. 
LANDON She's not.    She's got her own ideas. 
CLAY Mutant ideas. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LANDON Maybe to you. 
Eric and Clay exchange a look -- is Landon defending her? 
ERIC Belinda's telling everyone that kiss was real. 
LANDON It was. 
Eric and Clay smirk in disbelief. 
ERIC And that you're scamming on Jamie Sullivan. 
LANDON (not denying it) Scamming's a strong word. 
INT. BEAUFORT HIGH - CORRIDOR - NEXT MORNING 
Landon's waiting when Jamie approaches her locker. Her hair pulled back. She looks good in a simple, fresh way. 
LANDON You weren't in school yesterday. 
JAMIE I went to the doctor with my father. 
LANDON He okay? 
JAMIE Healthy as can be. 
Pause. She doesn't help him.          She opens her locker, gets what she needs. 
LANDON You were great the other night. 
JAMIE Thank you.   So were you. 
Pause.   He tries to touch her hair.       She ducks. 
LANDON I haven't been nice to you. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JAMIE You're hardly nice to anyone. 
LANDON (sincere) I'm sorry. 
JAMIE (walking away) I wish I could believe you. 
INT. CAFETERIA - LATER 
Jamie sits alone, reading, wearing her old brown sweater. Landon walks by Clay and Eric at a table. 
ERIC Landon! 
LANDON Later. 
Puts his tray down on Jamie's table and sits.      Making a public statement. 
JAMIE People can see. 
LANDON And that would ruin your reputation how? 
She goes back to her book.    Ignoring him. 
LANDON (re: her book) What's that? 
She doesn't look up.    Shows him the spine:     The Scarlet Letter. 
JAMIE I'm reading all the novels on Mr. Rothberg's best American authors list.

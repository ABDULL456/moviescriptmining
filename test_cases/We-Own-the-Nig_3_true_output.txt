Bobby lifts his shotgun and approaches. The weeds separate, REVEALING NEZHINSKI, with a look on his face that registers a kind of shock, a shock that he's been hit. Nezhinski sees Bobby standing over him. With all the energy he has in the world: 
VADIM NEZHINSKI Don't...don't let me die in here... 
Bobby stands over him for a BEAT. Then Bobby turns his back on Vadim, walks through the fires around him. As Vadim calls after him ("BOBBY! (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PLEASE, DON'T LEAVE ME HERE!"), the flames begin to engulf the area where Nezhinski lies... 
EXT. FIELD 
BOBBY EMERGES FROM THE FIRE...     HE WALKS TOWARD THE POLICE CARS. THE POLICE ARE ASSEMBLED     around: MARAT BUZHAYEV. BOBBY WATCHES HIM FOR A MOMENT,    HIS FACE filled with CONTROLLED RAGE. BEAT. EACH MAN    STARES AT EACH OTHER. THEN: 
MARAT BUZHAYEV Bobby--I, I didn't know it would be your family-- 
BOBBY TAKES A THREATENING STEP FORWARD. Bobby's expression seems unmatched in its ferocity; Marat sees in Bobby's eyes a horrible determination, begins to cry... Bobby's emotions are a CAULDRON: 
BOBBY GREEN Get down!   On the ground! 
Marat gets on his knees. WHIMPERING. Bobby puts Marat's hands on his head, starts PATTING HIM DOWN. CLEAN. 
BOBBY PUTS THE SHOTGUN AT MARAT'S TEMPLE.    We HEAR the DOGS, the FIRE, the WIND, the SIRENS... 
The police see the unforgiving expression on Bobby's face and the reality of the old man in front of them. Bobby turns to the others, particularly JACK. He looks at him, dark-eyed. Then he turns away and starts walking, making eye contact with none of them. He utters a command, to all of them and none of them in particular: 
BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D) Put him in the fuckin' van... Don't touch him... 
Bobby walks past the small building, which CONTINUES TO BURN SILENTLY--with that eerie BLUE FLAME... Other cops watch him with awe and respect. They back away from him. He proceeds on toward the cars. 
HE SEES: Joseph inside one of them, still. Staring at him. WE DOLLY WITH HIM as he moves to his brother. CROUCHES DOWN, stays by JOSEPH... 
CLOSE SHOT OF AN ANNOUNCEMENT BOARD, SURROUNDED BY FLOWERS: 
"ONE P.M.: N.Y.P.D. EVENT - ACADEMY GRADUATION." 
INT. ONE POLICE PLAZA - FOYER - OUTSIDE THE AUDITORIUM 
HUNDREDS OF POLICE OFFICERS, all dressed up to the nines, are HERE. White gloves and all. Milling about in a white plaster walled room. Upbeat chatter. Then: Bobby emerges through the DOORS in his DRESS BLUES. Upon seeing him, the others smile, CHEER. People touch him, shake his hand. Eye him with respect. AD-LIB GREETINGS. 
RANDOM OFFICERS Bobby! Hey! Lookit you--six months in the Academy and already you look like a chief! 
BOBBY GREEN Hey everybody... 
Bobby moves toward the AUDITORIUM DOORS.   Now Michael approaches. In Bobby's ear: 
MICHAEL SOLO I just saw the commissioner. A lotta people're gonna wanna talk to you--important people. About maybe settin' you up with your own unit. 
BOBBY GREEN All right.   We'll talk about that after. 
Bobby sees: JOSEPH, STANDING nearby with his hand on his child's shoulder, the rest of his FAMILY SURROUNDING HIM. The brothers embrace. Then: 
BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D) They're getting started--we should probably go in now. 
INT. AUDITORIUM 
The ceremony is getting underway. As Bobby and Joseph move past the seated crowd toward their chairs in front: 
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY You know, I think Pop would be real happy to see you like this. 
BOBBY GREEN (slight ironic laugh) I don't think he'd believe it... But I guess things don't always go the way you think they will. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY Ah, the Force'll treat you good. I'm sure you do very well. 
BOBBY GREEN You definitely gonna leave? Ain't no way you change your mind? 
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (shakes head; then:) It's the right thing. It's over for me--I'm out. 
BOBBY GREEN Listen, we'll spend some more time together from now on. Okay? I'll come over next week. 
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY Arright, yeah.    Sounds good. 
Bobby approaches the POLICE CHAPLAIN, hands him a note. 
BOBBY GREEN Chaplain? I'd like you to introduce me this way. If you don't mind. 
The CHAPLAIN looks at the paper, nods. He then walks to the podium. Bobby sits as the Chaplain begins: 
POLICE CHAPLAIN Ladies and gentlemen: we shall begin today's ceremony with the traditional invocation, moving then to the valedictorian address to be given by...Robert Grusinsky. Son of the late Deputy Chief Albert Grusinsky, brother of Captain Joseph Grusinsky. 
ANGLE ON BOBBY as his REAL NAME is SPOKEN: 
POLICE CHAPLAIN (CONT'D) You know, as I look at this fine young man seated here, I can't help but think about all the young members of our department. I get filled with such pride. (BEAT) Men like him are the great future of our Force... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
As the man speaks, Bobby SCANS the room. HE SEES ROSARIO, standing in the crowd behind the seated audience. Her face is partially obscured. BOBBY CANNOT BELIEVE THE FLOOD OF EMOTION that overwhelms him, the happiness he feels upon catching a glimpse of her. 
But just as quickly as this thrill grabs him, it disappears when she becomes completely visible; for he realizes that IT IS NOT HER but rather a young woman who bears merely a faint resemblance... Joseph interrupts this, leans over: 
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY I love you, Bobby.

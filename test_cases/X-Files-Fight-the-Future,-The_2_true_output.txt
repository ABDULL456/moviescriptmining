STRUGHOLD The geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us. About our place in their Colonization. 
WELL-MANICURED MAN This isn't Colonization, it's spontaneous repopulation. All our work... if it's true, then they've been using us all along. We've been laboring under a lie! 
2ND ELDER It could be an isolated case. 
WELL-MANICURED MAN How can we know?! 
STRUGHOLD We're going to tell them what we've found. What we've learned. Turn over a body infected with the gestating organism. 
WELL-MANICURED MAN In hope of what? Learning that it's true?! That we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms?! 
STRUGHOLD Let me remind you who is the new race. And who is the old. (beat) What could be gained by withholding anything from them; By pretending to ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. To start Colonization early. 
WELL-MANICURED MAN And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all. 
STRUGHOLD Cooperation is our only chance of saving ourselves. 
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN They still need us to carry out their preparations. 
STRUGHOLD We'll continue to use them as they do us. If only to play for more time, to continue work on our vaccine. 
WELL-MANICURED MAN Our vaccine may have no effect! 
STRUGHOLD Well, without a cure for the virus, we're nothing more than digestives anyway. 
All eyes go to the Well-Manicured Man. He is respected, if not the odd man out in this room. But he is all restrained anger now. 
WELL-MANICURED MAN My lateness may have well been absence. A course has already been taken. 
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN There are complications. 
He turns back to the TV monitor where Mulder and Scully remain frozen on the screen. 
WELL-MANICURED MAN Do they know? 
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN Mulder was in Dallas when we were trying to dispose of evidence. He's gone back there again. Someone has tipped him. 
WELL-MANICURED MAN Who? 
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN Kurtzweil, we think. 
STRUGHOLD We've allowed this man his freedom. His books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial. Has he outlived his usefulness to us? 
WELL-MANICURED MAN No one believes Kurtzweil or his books. He's a toiler. A crank. 
STRUGHOLD And Mulder? 
ELDER Our new situation makes us vulnerable. If he learns information as we do, he could jeopardize the Project's secrecy. 
2ND ELDER Control of information means control of Mulder. 
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN I can control Mulder. I've always controlled Mulder. 
STRUGHOLD This may take another approach. 
He says this, casting his look toward the Well-Manicured Man. A look of cold malevolence. The W.M.M.'s reaction is disdain. 
WELL-MANICURED MAN You can't kill Mulder. He's got too much light on him. 
STRUGHOLD You need not kill a man to destroy him. 
WELL-MANICURED MAN (personalizing the inference) No, you need only take away what is most precious to him. 
HARD CUT TO: 
EXT. SMALL PUBLIC PARK - CENTRAL TEXAS - DAY 
AGENT SCULLY 
She stands against a backdrop of Texas flatland, squinting into the sun. Shaking her head. 
SCULLY I don't know, Mulder... 
We are: 
WIDE ANGLE REVERSE, TO INCLUDE MULDER, standing in the middle of a park, replete with jungle gyms, playground equipment. All brand spanking new. They are standing right where there had once been a hard scrabble, parched and barren little field. Where the earthen hole had been dug by the young boys. And what had later been the site of so much activity by the group of scientists. But where there's now a park, thick green grass covering the parch of ground, including the spot where the hole had been. 
SCULLY He didn't mention a park. 
MULDER This is where he marked on the map, Scully. Where he says those fossils were unearthed. 
SCULLY I don't see any evidence of an archeological or any other kind of digsite. Not even a sewer or a storm drain. 
Mulder scans the area, confounded. Shaking his head as they walk.

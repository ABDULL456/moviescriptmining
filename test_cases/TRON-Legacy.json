{"train": "TRON LEGACY \nWritten by \nRichard Jefferies \n1   INT.   CYBERSPACE \nElectric-neon netherworld.     Pulsing chromatics over jet black. \nCONSTRUCTION CREW toils to complete a vast SWITCHING NEXUS. CYPER-TECH CREWMEN and MACHINERY branded \"X-NET\". \n3D lattice of routers, refractors, reassemblers... New, unused data OPTIK HIGHWAY routes radiate from all sides, crossing cyberspace. \nX-Net Tactical Corps troops (herein X-Takks) patrol every inch. \n2   INT.   X-NET NEXUS - UNDER CONSTRUCTION \nDATA \"TRAIN\" enters. Sliver of RED DATA ENERGY shunt off, shooting into RANDOM MEMORY BUFFER - geometrically perfect lattice of PLASMA BEAMS and WHITE HOT intersection points. \nX-Takks notice, moving to investigate. \nDEEP IN THE LATTICE: \nRed data \"uploads\" into solid form. A RED FIGURE. We see from the back - infrared strobing DISK, etched metallic detail, lethal EDGES - \nThen slowly he - IT - turns.     Hardly a face, only data-hungry eyes, riveted to a TASK - \nTRON 2.0. \nSeriously upgraded, over-clocked, armed for trouble. The friendly hero we once knew has been re-programmed into a ruthless cyber-ninja. \nX-Takks search ten story gantries. \nTRON springs into the lattice, dodging PLASMA BEAMS, avoiding detection. Slips into: \n3   INT.   NEXUS MAIN SHAFT \nX-Takks on high alert. \nTRON slips down main shaft, freezes, confirms data.       Darts behind MAIN POWER SUPPLY. \nPulls his DISK.     DISK opens, extends oscillating DATA KEY. \n(CONTINUED) \n3   CONTINUED: \nTRON inserts key in and ENCRYPTION PANEL.     Circuits energize. Shockwave quakes system. \nPOWER SUPPLY OVERLOADS, SHORTING OUT. \nX-Takks spot TRON. \nX-TAKKS Intruder!   Fix coordinates! \nPOLICE POUNCE, FIRING. \nTron pulls hyper-disk off his back and HURLS IT - \nDISK strikes cop, fries his circuits. Disk ricochets, brutally accurate, takes out three more Police - \nTRON flips into the air - His DISK boomerangs straight for him. Certain death. But his timing is inhumanly accurate. DISK docks on his back midair, lands and bolts. \nALARMS WAIL - \nPOWER SUPPLY VERGES on MELTDOWN, CIRCUITS FRY, PLASMA SPEWS. X-NET CRISIS TEAM rushes in, inserts MASTER KEY. POWER SUPPLY STABILIZES. Catastrophe averted. \nTRON flips away, chased by firing X-Takks - \nArriving on the scene - split-second response: \nElite team of X-NET SECURITY AGENTS, lead by: \nRX23 SECURITY LEADER (Cyber-twin of our real-world hero RUSH). \nTRON jumps down MAIN SHAFT - a thousand stories. Riding his DISK as a heat shield dodges X-Net fire, swerves into a DATA CHANNEL - \nRX23 and a pair of his AGENTS hop on PULSE RIDER vehicles, hotly pursuing TRON. \nTRON PLUNGES onto a DATA HIGHWAY - speed out of NEXUS, hurls across cyberspace. \nAGENT 1 This is the first time an Intruder has broken into X-Net! \nRX23 LEADER And it's the last. Follow him! Shut him down! \nThey speed onto the OPTIK HIGHWAY. \n4   INT.   X-NET OPTIK HIGHWAY \nBroadband, light-speed OPTIK HIGHWAY.     Empty, except for: \nTRON - accelerating, escaping. \nRx23 and AGENTS catch up fast on Pulse Rider Vehicles. \nTRON throws his disk. Blings off Agents - triggers CRASH. PLASMA BLAST rips open highway wall. \nRx23 emerges unscathed, pursuing. \n5   EXT.   CYBERSPACE - ANCIENT SYSTEM ZONE \nTRON leaps out blast hole, recovers his disk, vanishes into ANCIENT SYSTEM ZONE. \nSINCLAIR We don't have 20 hours. This problem needs to be gone before tomorrow 9AM. Come on people, this company's future is at stake! It's time to think without a box! \nMinds ponder grimly. Finally, a lone VP rises.      It's RUDY, the company Archivist. \nRUDY At a time like this, let's seek inspiration in the past. We should ask ourselves: What solution would spring from the inspired mind of our departed leader, Flynn. \n(CONTINUED) \n23   CONTINUED:    (3) \nHe's got an obituary photo of FLYNN, Encom's legendary previous - and deceased - CEO. \nGroans around the table. Execs rolls their eyes, disses Rudy's idea. Flynn has become a stale company joke. \nRudy sheepishly sits. \nBut Sinclair stops behind Rudy, eyes fixed on the photo of Flynn. An idea takes hold. He looks to Meg. \nSINCLAIR Is the QF-401 is operational? \nMEG Um...   Midway into phase one testing. \nConfusion among execs.     Nobody knows what a \"QF-401\" is. Not even Rush. \nSINCLAIR If we can't fight this intruder from the outside, then maybe we need to fight him from the inside. \nMeg's mind races. \nMEG I'm ready to do my part. \nSINCLAIR This company needs a hero. Who among you is the smartest, most resourceful and courageous? \nLooks trade around the table.     Meg slowly rises, indicating her choice. \nMEG Who else could it be? \nShe's singled out Rush. \n24   INT.   ENCOM CORP CORRIDOR - SECURE ELEVATOR - DAY \nMeg leads Sinclair and Rush to a SECURE ELEVATOR.     Her retinal scan ID opens the door. They step in. \n25   INT.   ENCOM SECURE ELEVATOR - GOING DOWN - MOMENTS LATER \nRUSH Somebody going to tell me what I've been volunteered for? \n(CONTINUED) \n25   CONTINUED: \nSINCLAIR Rush, you're the only one I can trust to eliminate the intruder. But you won't be doing it the way you thought. Meg's been working on something down here that's, well... Beyond Top Secret. \nRush drills a look at Meg, but she keeps it all business. \n26   INT.   ENCOM ADVANCED RESEARCH LAB - MOMENTS LATER \nOut the elevator, Meg leads them into a maze of ultra-tech gear. \nMEG This is where Flynn worked.   And where he died. \nAmid sleek new equipment, there's a glass cabinet housing a CHARRED REMNANT of strange machinery. \nSINCLAIR Meg has reconstructed Flynn's last project. This time it works. \nMega signals lab assistant DEWEY. He pokes buttons:       A MASSIVE TECHNICAL DEVICE unfolds and boots up. \nRUSH You didn't pick this up at Circuit City. What is it? \nMEG A Quantum Digitizer. Prototype, only one of its kind. Flynn designed it to break down physical objects into high resolution data. Luckily, we salvaged his key components and back-engineered the system. \nShe opens a cage, places her LAB RAT (Jo-Jo) on a target stage. Dewey boots controls, presses commands. Beam array scans the rat into the computer, forming a 3D rat-image on screens, dematerializing the physical rat. Device revs down. \nRush runs his hand over the empty target stage. \nRUSH That's...   Not possible. \nLab rat has vanished from the physical world.     Its digitized image rotates on monitors. \n(CONTINUED) \n26   CONTINUED: \nMEG Flynn was trying to take it one step further. He wanted to transport a human being into cyberspace. \nRUSH You mean the urban legends? A computer sucked Flynn into cyberspace a long time ago. \nSINCLAIR We think it happened. \nMeg agrees.    Rush gets a chill. \nSINCLAIR It was a fluke. But Flynn worked for years, down here, trying to make it happen again. One day a test went bad. A plasma reaction destroyed this lab. Flynn was reduced to ash. \nRush views the charred remains in the glass case. Photos of the destroyed lab. Spooky evidence of a hellish death scene. \nRUSH I was never told how he died. It was all just weird, you know, because Flynn's the guy who hired me. But he was strange, kept to himself, I didn't know what job I was supposed to be doing. (to Sinclair) Then you came onboard, the company woke up, we had a direction. It was kind of pathetic, because by the time Flynn died, everybody was too busy to care. \nSINCLAIR He was brilliant in his way, but genius without discipline leads to nothing. His reckless habits nearly ruined this company... And for sure got him killed. \nA last look at the charred remains of Flynn's machine. \nMEG That kind of accident can't happen again. We've upgraded the system in ways Flynn never could. The chips didn't exist until now. \n(CONTINUED) \nRush's electrified body hurtles across the void, eyes filled with TERROR and AWE. \nTRANSFORMS TO: \n28   EXT.   CYBERSPACE - X-NET CENTRAL SERVER \nShimmering bits morph into an awesome cyberscape. \nRush enters this bizarre world - CRASH/FLASH - stranger in a strange land. Data energy ZAPS off his body, interacting with the landscape circuitry around him. He fights it, tries to control it. \n28   CONTINUED: \nRush stands, beholds the place. Looks at his hands and arms, clad in circuitry. He finds he had landed outside: \nFortress-like X-NET CENTRAL SERVER.       ALARMS SOUNDING inside. \nHe turns, looks up a FIREWALL. Hundreds of X-Takk Troops hurry to look down. FIRING WEAPONS. \nA FIGURE comes at him, down the wall, STREAKING RED. \nBLAMMO! \nTRON lands on a plateau above Rush, gazing down. \nThey face each other, equally perplexed. \nRush is no longer human, but not quite a program either. Energy zaps off his body, infusing the surrounding circuitry. \nTron stares, unblinking - Cyber-Ninja. \nRUSH It's YOU!    The intruder! \nRush's body circuits PULSE with anger - data surges out his feet, across floor circuitry, up to the plateau. Energy interacts with Tron's body circuits, siphoning off bits of code. \nCode races across Rush's eyes.        Identification data. \nRUSH You are...    TRON?!? \nX-Takks hustle onto the scene. \nTron leaps off the plateau, cutting the data connection.      He whips his disk off his back and THROWS. \nDisk SLAMS Rush in the gut, knocks him flat. \nRUSH ARRRGHH! \nX-Takks pursue Tron - \nTron recovers his disk - vanishes in an OUTBOUND DATA STREAM, losing his pursuers. \nX-Takks pull Rush to his feet, shocked. \nX-TAKK 1 RX23?! \n28   CONTINUED:    (2) \nX-TAKK 2 But...    You crashed irrecoverably! \nRUSH Uh, well, I'm not exactly - \nX-TAKK 3 RX23 has been rebooted! \nVOICE RX23 reboot was not authorized! \nPushing through Police: A sleek, smart cyber-babe MEGA. (She's Meg's cyber-twin: Twice the edge, half the patience, all the curves.) \nRush is awed by the sight of her. \nRUSH Yow.     I know who programmed you. \nMEGA I am Mega, X-Net Intelligence. \nRUSH Mega.     Cool.     I am - \nMEGA A spy? Posing as RX23? Under which register were you rebooted? \nRUSH I'm a User. \nMega and X-Takks look at him like he's crazy. \nMEGA Detain this impostor. \nX-Takks move to seize Rush. \nRUSH No wait, look. We're on the same side here. I got an ID on the intruder! \nMega touches Rush, exciting his energy flow.        She reads data streaming in his eyes - TRON'S ID info. \nMEGA \"Tron\"? \nX-TAKK 2 How did he get that?? \n(CONTINUED) \n28   CONTINUED:    (3) \nMEGA Plexor must know of this! \n29   EXT.   CENTRAL CONTROL SERVER \nMega and X-Takks escort Rush across bridges, in security portals. Firewalls cool and part, allowing them to pass. \nDown a grand corridor, past towering energy columns and throbbing green memory banks. They cross a bridge. View includes: Vast square concentric security rings surround a massive cubic POWER SUPPLY CORE. \nMEGA Of course not. But I am programmed to predict all possible errors. You contain an infinite quantity. \nRUSH Meg for sure programmed you. \nMEGA I have no data on \"Meg\". \nRUSH Never mind.    I'm being random. \nMega speeds along empty X-Net OPTIK HIGHWAY. Wide, secure, newly constructed. High above the tangle of chaotic, clogged OLD DATA ARTERIES. \nRUSH X-Net is amazing. It's going to change everything. Unless one rogue program called Tron brings it down. Do you believe he could? \nMEGA I calculated the probability. (soberly) He could crash it all. \nRUSH So we're working together on this? \n(CONTINUED) \n32   CONTINUED: \nMEGA As instructed, I will interface. \nMega pulls STRAITHE into: \n33   INT.   X-NET SWITCHING NEXUS/HUB CITY \nConstruction nearly complete.       High security. \nMega leads Rush to secured encryption gates.         Her eyes light with data, the gate opens. \nMEGA The program \"KROD\" is over there. \nAcross a bridge: An old-network HUB CITY. Like Hong Kong in wilder days. Jammed with Programs, colorful data, loud data transfer screams. \nRUSH What a dump. \nHe heads across, but Mega hesitates. \nRUSH Hey.    Interface. \nMega grudgingly follows.       Portal closes. \n34   EXT.   HUB CITY \nElectro-pop overload. Rush and Mega squeeze through crowds, past screaming data pipes and sizzling circuitry. \nCity is dominated by mugshots of TRON:          \"ENEMY OF THE FUTURE\" \nMega locates a gleaming X-NET KIOSK. A PROMOTER (KROD) extoles the virtues of the X-Net system: \nKROD Three more hub cities have been attacked by viruses! (crowd gets scared) But X-Net opens soon! You will travel in total security! \nCrowd buzzes.       They can't wait. \nMEGA This is the one you seek? \nRush approaches Krod. Looks like Miles Rabbish.           There's a bizarre moment of recognition between them. \n34   CONTINUED: \nRUSH It's gotta be - \nKROD Krod! \nRUSH Krod! \nKROD Yeah, yeah -     Heeey! \nRUSH The best pattern recognition program ever. (to Mega) This guy can filter a river of junk data and pull out the good stuff. \nKROD You know it, dude! \nKrod smiles big at Mega, refers to Rush: \nKROD Who is this guy? \nRush pulls Krod aside. \nRUSH Miles - I mean Krod, you flew the search engine. You ran a trace on a hotshot lightcycle rider. The red guy. Remember? \nKROD Well. Eh. I'd like to help you, but truth is, I just got rebooted from a big crash. There's nothing left in my memory from before. \nHe taps his head. \nMEGA This will yield zero. \nRUSH Hang on. \nRush thinks, touches a surface. Concentrates. Circuitry zaps from data coming off his hands. Connections illuminate, data races around walls and floors. \nPrograms stop what they're doing, amazed by the feat. \n(CONTINUED) \n34   CONTINUED:    (2) \nMega is astonished - and privately worried. \nRush's data flow illuminates surfaces with images from HIS memory - the opening light cycle race. \nRUSH Remember, Krod? You were watching this lightcycle duel, a red guy and a green guy, head-to-head. \nKrod gawks at the image, but he's stumped. \n38   CONTINUED: \nSINCLAIR Tron? Wasn't Tron one of our programs? \nSinclair and Meg trade baffled looks. \n39   INT.   CYBERSPACE - X-NET NEXUS \nPlexor oversees construction.     X-Takk Commander points to something in the distance. \nBeyond the horizon, the RUBY RED BEAM reaches to the heavens. \nPlexor sees it, alarmed. \n40   EXT.   CYBERSPACE - ANCIENT I/O PORT - MORNING \nText forms in magenta circuitry - GOOD WORK PARTNER. \nRUSH I have a plan to crash Tron. \nMega turns with alarm. \nMEGA ABORT! \nWalls THUNDER and CRASH IN - \nRush leaps clear with his disk - \nMASSIVE ROMBALL (data reformatting orb) hurtles around the I/O Port, ZAPPING all it touches, de-rezzing data structures into neutral gray \"blank matter\". \nROMBALL loops skyward. \nGIANT D-REZZ PROGRAM crashes down from above, retrieves ROMBALL - He's ENORMOUS, TOUGH, SINGLE-MINDED. \n41   INT.   ENCOM CORPORATION - SINCLAIR'S OFFICE - DAY \nSinclair and Meg hang on the broken transmission: \nMEG Rush? \nWords appear:    END OF LINE. \nSINCLAIR He'd better not fail. \n42   EXT.   ANCIENT COMPUTER SYSTEM I/O PORT \nD-Rezz screams like a modem, hurls ROMBALL - \nMega and Krod dive clear - \nROMBALL misses them, but BLAZES DOWN two more I/O Ports.        D- rezz retrieves ROMBALL, bears down on Mega and Krod. \nRUSH Hey! Double points if you nail me! Bring it on! \nD-Rezz turns his ugly sights on Rush, baited away from Mega and Krod. \nD-rezz flexes and ROARS, revealing an X-NET LOGO on his chest. \nRUSH Stop!    End your routine! \nD-rezz corners Rush, hurls his ROMBALL - Ball fires every circuit in its path, bleaching away data energy. \nRush dodges - \nRUSH Cease!    Desist! We're on the same team! \nMega throws her disk, plings D-rezz on the skull.      D-rezz turns on her - \nRush runs, LEAPS on D-Rezz's back.      Like riding a gorilla - \nD-Rezz flips Rush to the ground, pins him with one mighty hand, raises his ROMBALL for the kill. \nRUSH I'm X-Net too! \nData flows from Rush's body, up D-Rezz's clamping arm. Radiant energy between predator and prey. \nDigits race in D-rezz's eyes. A code unlocks. He looks down, finally registering the X-Net markings on Rush's outfit. \nD-Rezz lets go of Rush, slumps back on his haunches.       Lowers his head in shame. \nRUSH No, hey, hey big guy, don't take it so hard. We all have bad days. \n(CONTINUED) \n42   CONTINUED: \nRUSH rolls the BIG ROMBALL over:     A peace offering. \nMega and Krod cautiously approach. \nMEGA He was carrying out his programming. All I/O Ports are scheduled for de- rezz. \nD-rezz hears this, happy to be understood.       (He never talks.) \nKROD Easy, big guy. No harm, no foul. \nRUSH D-Rezz, we can use a guy with your raw power. You ready to be a hero for X-Net? \nD-Rezz stands, clutches his ROMBALL.       Reporting for duty. \nKROD Cool. Now I've got somebody I can boss around. \nD-rezz modem-growls at Krod. \nRUSH WHY DID YOU DO THAT?! \nMEGA I-    I GOT SCARED! \nKrod shoots gap.      D-rezz is ready to smash him with his Romball. \nI-BEEM No!   It's Krod! Tron is OVER THERE! \nD-rezz makes mental switch, hurls Romball. \nRomball bounces down solid rock, onto game grid, rolls with ferocious speed, DIAGONALLY across the grid. \nRomball curves to track Tron - like a great bowling shot. \nRomball clips rear wheel of Tron's lightcycle.       Lightcycle vaporizes. Tron skids and tumbles. \nI-beem zaps beside Rush and Mega.       Krod and D-rezz join them. \n(CONTINUED) \n49   CONTINUED:    (2) \nKROD There he goes! \nTron climbs over rocks, escaping through a TUNNEL. \nRUSH We've got him now.    Let's go! \nWHOOSH! Electro-fire Romball careens across grid, bearing down on them. \nGroup DIVES CLEAR. \nD-rezz swings in a foot, stopping the Romball - inches short of mowing down Krod. \nKROD I could have done that. \nHe strobes, freezes, hits the deck. \n50   INT.   ANCIENT COMPUTER SYSTEM TUNNEL \nStalking their prey:       Rush, Krod, I-beem and D-rezz. \nMEGA We can't go any further. \nAhead, vast old circuitry has been \"eaten through\" by dull throbbing greenish MEMORY LEAKAGE. Paths of unaffected material are narrow and maze-like. \nRUSH What is it? \nKROD Don't ask, dude. \nMEGA It's a memory leak, once it starts, it infects everything. \nI-BEEM Touch it and you crash forever.     We cannot risk it. \nMEGA I agree. \nD-rezz grunts. \nKROD Then it's settled. \n50   CONTINUED: \nKrod turns to head home. \nRUSH Stop. Listen to me. You might not believe there's a world outside of this one, but let's just say a guy named Sinclair is depending on me. If Tron got through here, then I can too. Who's with me? \nD-rezz steps forward, then I-Beem.      Shamed, Krod joins them. Finally, Mega makes it unanimous. \nRUSH Good. I-beem, take D-rezz, see what's up ahead. We'll guard this portal until you come back. \nI-beem and D-rezz buddy up and depart on a recon mission. \nKrod pulls off his disk, nervously practices boomerang throws. \nRUSH Better show me how to use mine. \nKROD No problem. It's all in the velocity- vector ratio. \nRush pulls the disk off his own back.      He throws - disk flies wild - he runs to retrieve it. \nMega retreats to a side area, partially eroded by memory leakage. She finds the remnants of COM CIRCUITRY and stares data beams into its transducer. \nINTERCUT WITH: \n51   EXT.   X-NET NEXUS UNDER CONSTRUCTION - PLEXOR'S VEHICLE \nPlexor's vehicle circuitry forms image of Mega. \nPLEXOR Report. \nMEGA We interfaced with Tron.   He escaped into a dark zone. \n52   INT.   ANCIENT COMPUTER SYSTEM TUNNEL \nAround a corner, Rush comes to retrieve his disk.       He pauses to eavesdrop on Mega's communication: \n(CONTINUED) \n52   CONTINUED: \nPLEXOR The Random One has proven effective? \nMEGA He is all glitches and bad data. He virtually got us de-rezzed. I recommend we terminate this mission. \nRUSH Ouch! \n(CONTINUED) \n53   CONTINUED: \nHis ankle.    He straightens, standing in front of D-rezz. \nLays eyes on Tron. \nRUSH Hey!   Pick on somebody your own size! \nD-rezz is twice as big as either of them. \nTron's eyes are cold, lifeless, calculating.       Scanning his new opponent without success. \nRUSH You've got no data on me. \nRush pulls his disk off his back, poised for a duel. \nTron moves with calculation, grips his hyper-etched disk. Circling his prey. \nThrows again - \nBRRANGG - \nRush DUCKS - \nTron's disk slams D-rezz.     D-rezz tries to catch the disk, but he's just too slow. \nRush throws his disk. Beginner's luck - it banks off a wall and nearly smacks Tron. Rush snags it on the way back, before it tumbles into memory leakage. \nTron jumps up two levels.     Retrieves his disk. \nRUSH D-rezz, pull me up! \nD-rezz hoists Rush up.     Fingers grab upper deck. \nTron jockeys for position.     Throws disk - \nDisk strikes D-rezz in the ribs.     Blast damage. \nD-rezz loses footing. \nRush grabs upper level. \nD-rezz slips toward memory leakage. \nRush grabs D-rezz's hand - he weighs a ton. \nMega, Krod and I-beem can't get here to help - \n53   CONTINUED:    (2) \nRUSH Hang on, man! HANG ON! \nBut D-rezz's big hand slips out of Rush's. \nD-rezz PLUMMETS into memory leakage, zapping away in a blaze of glory - \nRUSH NOOOO! \nHe comes to his feet, facing Tron.       Determined. \nRUSH I know who you are. Encom security program Tr856 - TRON! \nTron pauses.    Processes. \nRUSH Who is your User?? \nTron glitches at the question. \nRUSH Who programmed you?? I know your encryption code. Tell me your User or I shut you down. \nTron throws his disk. \nRush dodges. He sends waves of data energy through floor circuits, reaching into Tron's body. \nRUSH I can shut you down with a nine digit code. WHO IS YOUR USER?? 392 - \nTron's body animates painfully, as the first three code digits click into place. \nTron FLIPS away, breaking contact with floor.        Data transfer stops. Tron steals away through a tunnel. \nRush pursues. \nKrod, Mega and I-beem clamber for a way to follow. \n54   INT.   OBSOLETE COMPUTER GAME ARENA \nCircular, riddled with memory leaks. \nRush hurries to the center.       No sign of Tron. \n(CONTINUED) \n54   CONTINUED: \nRUSH Tell me, Tron! Who programmed you? Here's your encryption code! 3-6-2- \nRush sends data coursing into floor circuits. It radiates up walls, across bridges... And finds TRON in hiding. \nData races into Tron's body. Six code numbers engage; he glitches. He LEAPS to breaks the contact, flinging his disk - \nRUSH Yeah, I'm a User. A superior being. The first to enter this realm. And you are - ? \nFigure's circuitry lights.         Finally, we see the face... \nIt is FLYNN. \nFLYNN The first. \nRUSH Flynn.   How can you be here? \n54   CONTINUED:    (4) \nKROD You know this dude? \nRUSH Yeah, he's a lunatic! \nI-beem panics, zaps away in an energy beam. He reforms further along for a \"breath\", then zaps further away. Three FINITY FIGHTERS chase him. \nRush is amazed to find him self in the presence of Encom's former leader. \nFlynn comes closer, recognizing Rush. \nFLYNN Rush Nortebi. I remember hiring you. \nThey are equally dumbfounded. \nKROD Somebody tipped these guys off about us. \nMEGA Not soon enough. \nFighters step aside, Mega enters, furious at Rush. \nMEGA You weren't supposed to beat Tron. I thought for sure he'd finish you. \nRUSH Thanks. \nMEGA You destroyed our last hope! \nKROD I detect a pattern in her behavior. \nRUSH She's a spy. \nMega and Rush ooze mutual contempt.    Rush turns on Flynn. \nRUSH No wonder I couldn't figure it out. I assumed Tron User was on the outside! If I'd known this, I would blown past him and come straight for you. \n(CONTINUED) \n54   CONTINUED:    (5) \nFlynn yanks Tron's disk from Rush, peers over the precipice. Below, the last of Tron is consumed by memory leakage. \nFlynn ponders Tron's lifeless disk. He falters on his bad leg. Mega throws an arm around to help him stand. Melancholy energy courses between them. \nMEGA I failed our cause. \nFLYNN You did everything you could. \nThey know each other well. \nRush registers jealousy, but larger concerns prevail: \nRUSH Flynn never died... (dawning) Because your Quantum Digitizer worked. That's how you got here... I know - that's how I got here too. \nFlynn studies Rush, anger rising. \nFLYNN The day after I hired you, you start sucking up to Sinclair. You thought I didn't know. Bet he offered your a partnership for this, right? You have no idea the damage you've done. \nRUSH I'm only getting started. Man, you were the company joke. Now I see why. You melted down your lab to take this little joyride. You got stuck here so all you can do is wreck other people's hard work. \nFLYNN Open your eyes, geek. My lab was rigged. My \"death\" was no accident. I pushed the button just in time to escape... Almost in time. \nHe indicates his deformed leg.     Mega, Krod and the others listen with awed bewilderment.     These two guys speak of a world unknown to them. \nRUSH You're paranoid. Who would want you dead? \n(CONTINUED) \n54   CONTINUED:    (6) \nFLYNN The same guy I programmed Tron to shut down. Same one you've been sucking up to. Sinclair. And his cyber-henchman, Plexor. \nMalicious grumbles from Fighters. \nRUSH Too many of your brain cells have gotten zapped in here, old man. \nFLYNN Rush, you lamer! You've been working for the bad guy. \nThree Fighters return from the I-beem pursuit.      Empty-handed. \nFIGHTER ONE He got away. \nFlynn scowls at Rush. Sin number two.       Flynn slips Tron's dead disk in a special case. \nFLYNN Let's move. X-Net goons will soon be all over this place. \n55   EXT.   GAME GRID \nEnergy zaps across grid, forming into I-beem. He's on the run, de-rezzing, zapping, reforming, bolting for: \n56   EXT.   ANCIENT COMPUTER SYSTEM -      DEMOLISHED I/O PORTS \nI-beem de-rezzes, reforms, zaps himself toward the nearest X- Net OPTIK HIGHWAY. \nFlynn hastens their journey. \nMEGA Rush was trying to expose us! \nFLYNN They didn't see us.   Keep moving! \nMega, Boole and Quantz move along, shoving Krod and Rush. \nRUSH We've got to tell people on the outside - \nFLYNN Plexor shut down all the I/O ports. Only HE communicates with the outside. Sinclair holds all the cards. \nFlynn turns on Rush - one of Sinclair's cards. \nFLYNN How did you get here?! \nRUSH Megan Randall sent me. (points out Mega) Her User. She fixed your lab and sent me here to take out Tron. \nFLYNN Megan Randall? I remember her. Smart, wise beyond her years. I can't believe she'd fall for Sinclair's lies. \nHe glances at Mega, then shoves Rush along. \n67   INT.   FIGHTER HIDE-OUT \nFlynn, Mega, Fighters bring Rush and Krod into the clandestine Fighter base. Like a wartime casualty center, with corrupted Fighter Programs lining corridors. \nRUSH What happened to them? \nMEGA Try to attack Plexor head-on, this is what happens. Because of you, there will be millions more. \n(CONTINUED) \n67   CONTINUED: \nThey arrive at a laser-barred JAIL BLOCK, where a dozen BIG X-Takk Troops are held prisoner. \nFLYNN Lock up these two. We'll hold them for ransom. Or use them for target practice. \nFlynn and Mega turn to go.      Boole and Quantz use PROD LANCES to herd Rush and Krod. \nRUSH Flynn. You think I'm Sinclair's flunky, but I'm not. \nFlynn pauses.    Rush speaks low, so X-Net Captives can't hear. \nRUSH I'm sorry about Tron. \nKROD Yeah, we're - Sorry? \nRUSH We were just doing a job, we had no way of knowing the truth. \nKROD No way at all. \nRUSH Flynn, I was wrong about you. You've been doing the right thing in here. Plexor has to be shut down. Sinclair has to be exposed. \nKROD Like he said. \nRUSH Krod and I are ready to help. \nKROD We are? \nFlynn puzzles over Rush. \nFLYNN Mega, what do you read in him? \nMega circles Rush, scanning his circuits. \nMEGA Independent operating instructions. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n67   CONTINUED:    (2) \nMEGA (CONT'D) He will act as necessary to increase probability of his own survival. \nRUSH You don't know me. \nMEGA He cannot to be trusted. \nRUSH Trust?! You're the one who's been lying to me the whole time! \nRush points a finger at Mega - BOLT of ATTRACTION ENERGY shoots off his finger, ZAPS her on the nose. \nMega's circuits OVERLOAD, she flies back - \nRush, startled, looks at his finger. \nFighters muscle Rush and Krod away. \nFlynn holds Mega, anger re-ignited. \nFLYNN Mega's been risking her existence for our cause, lamer. That's more than you'll ever do. (to Fighters) Lock them away! \nFighters toss Rush and Krod in the JAIL BLOCK with the BIG X- TAKK soldiers. Does finger-signs, body circuit language. \nKROD Yo, s'up?     Eh... X-Net rules, man. \nRUSH Hey Krod...     Shut down. \nRush peers out of his cage, watching Mega go.        She turns for a final scowl, then exits. \n68   EXT.   X-NET CENTRAL SERVER - EVENING \nX-Takk Troops sound alert. \nSINCLAIR That's impossible. \nPLEXOR Flynn commanded the intruder Tron. \nSINCLAIR You've got to be wrong about this. \nPLEXOR I was programmed error-free.      By you. \nSinclair ponders the unimaginable. \nSINCLAIR Flynn...     escaped?! \nPLEXOR He leads a group who seek to prevent the opening of X-Net. The one called Rush has joined them. \n72   CONTINUED: \nSINCLAIR Rush? My guy? What lies has Flynn filled him with? \nPLEXOR Or what truths? \nSinclair peers at the screen text, agitation growing. A news article pops up, recounting the lab accident and Flynn's \"death\". X-Net launch countdown ticks. \nSINCLAIR This world can never know all I have done. You have a plan to contain Flynn? \nPLEXOR Of course. \nSINCLAIR Don't just contain him.    Destroy him. \nPLEXOR Instructions received.    And the one called Rush? \nSinclair mulls for two seconds, then: \nSINCLAIR He knows too much. Get rid of him. \nPLEXOR Instructions received. \n73   INT.   JAIL BLOCK \nRush and Krod get chummy with cell-mate X-Takks.     They mock- fight together, getting insider tips. \nX-TAKK 1 And whatever you do, don't let them hit you here... \nIndicates a CIRCUIT NEXUS on his lower SPINE. \nX-TAKK 1 All X-Net Programs have a weak spot there. \nRUSH Hear that, Krod? Never let them get to your weak spot. \n(CONTINUED) \n73   CONTINUED: \nKrod twists around, playing with his spinal nexus. \nKROD Gurfle!   I never knew that. \nPull back to see: \nFlynn secretly observes Rush.     Pondering.    Boole arrives behind him. \nBOOLE We're ready for you now. \nThey head upstairs. \n74   INT.   FIGHTER HIDE-OUT \nFlynn reviews Fighter training. Troops throw disks, battle in pairs, repair weapons, tweak armor circuitry. \nFlynn carries Tron's dark disk, contemplating it.       He moves past a line-up of his finest Fighters. \nFLYNN If X-Net is allowed to open it's the beginning of the end of a free and open cyberspace. We can't let Plexor get away with this. Our game plan has not changed. Tron was specially programmed to break into X-Net and shut down power supplies. We would then exploit these weak points and cripple the system. Tron's role was essential One of you must take his place. \nHe holds up Tron's disk. \nFLYNN Who among you can power Tron's disk and carry out his mission? \nAll Fighters take a step forward. \nFLYNN It's the most dangerous job. If you're not up for it, nobody's going to blame you. \nAll stand firm. \nFlynn lays Tron's disk in the first Fighter's hands. Fighter summons his will, causing the disk to glow faintly. But it soon goes dark again. \n74   CONTINUED: \nNext Fighter holds the disk, bearing down, animating the circuits... But he buckles and the disk falls dims. \nMega worries: One-by-one, Fighters fail to power Tron's disk. Flynn reaches the end of the line. \nMega puts her hands out to receive the disk. \nFlynn hesitates, then hands her Tron's disk. \nMega clenches it, concentrating deeply. Her energy infuses the disk, animating its circuits stronger than anyone. \nBur soon, her eyes strobe, her body circuits overload. \nShe lets go.    Tron's disk thunks the floor, goes dark. \nMega hardens her resolve. \nMEGA There are other ways to crash Plexor. I will return to him, he still trusts me. I will get close and crash him with direct contact - \n(CONTINUED) \n82   CONTINUED: \nKROD She's with Flynn!       I mean, totally WITH Flynn -! \nRUSH (cuts off Krod, covers) Flynn was smart enough to interrogate her first. \nKROD Right. \nPLEXOR (duped) She contains sensitive data. Flynn cannot be allowed to hack her. \nRush and Krod notice: Behind Plexor and his Soldiers, BOOLE, QUANTZ and FINITY FIGHTERS move into position. They signal Rush and Krod not to blow their cover. Rush makes Krod comply. An ambush is ready to spring. \nRUSH Yeah, only -     We kicked Flynn's butt, too. \nKROD You should have seen it.       Flynn won't be a problem. \nX-Takk Prisoners are confused. \nPLEXOR Then...   Why were you imprisoned? \nX-TAKK Ambush! \nFighters POUNCE, throwing disks - \nRush grabs a PROD LANCE, nails two X-Takks on their spinal nexus. They go down hard. \nPLEXOR Delete them all! \nPlexor hurls an ENERGY BALL - Rush DUCKS, grazed by its FRACTAL comet trail. \nFighters beat back Plexor.         His concerns shift.    He ducks into an ascension shaft - \nRush and Krod are left fighting back-to-back, out-manned three-to-one. \n83   INT.   FIGHTER HIDE-OUT ASCENSION SHAFT \nPlexor races upward, but is blocked by a unit of Fighters. \nPlexor pulls off his special TRIANGULAR DEATH DISK - FLINGS it. Disk ricochets off three Fighters, knocking them out. Another lethal fling and the remains Fighters fall. \nPlexor retrieves his death-disk with heart-stopping accuracy, darts into: \n84   INT.   FIGHTER HIDE-OUT MAIN ARENA \nPLEXOR It's a TRAP! \nX-Takk Troops react, bolting for their Cruisers. \nFloor circuits ACTIVATE -     X-Takks ZAP and FREEZE. \nFighters appear from all directions. \nDisks fly - \nX-Takks wield stout MAZER weapons - \nEven the corrupted Fighter Programs pitch in, working in clever teams, chipping away at Plexor's forces. \nBut X-Takks have tougher armor and more awesome weapons. \nX-Takk Mazer cuts down Fighters by the dozen, leaving them corrupted or shut down. \nUPPER LEVEL: \nFlynn struggles to help wounded Fighters - He captures a Mazer and uses it against X-Takks... But Flynn can't move well on his bad leg. He watches his troops getting trounced. \nFLYNN Retreat! Over that way!     Move around their flank! \nZAP!   A Mazer blast strikes Flynn's bad leg. \nFLYNN Arrrgghhh! \nMega appears, throws her disk with deadly accuracy. The offending X-Takk Soldier crashes. Millions of bits spray over main arena - fractal fireworks. \n(CONTINUED) \n84   CONTINUED: \nMega grabs Flynn from falling.       They make for a bridge. \nFlynn slaps a wall panel.       Trigger circuit activates, surging down into... \n85   INT.   FIGHTER HIDE-OUT MAIN ARENA \n...Circuit energizes a sector of floor circuits, which overload and BLAZE - frying twenty X-Takks. \n86   INT.   JAIL BLOCK AREA \nRush and Krod use puny PROD LANCES against fearsome X-Takks... \nRush charges an X-Takk dude, Krod gets cornered by another. Rush dodges his death blow, spine-zapping his foe... Krod prepares to die, as X-Takk Bully pins him with a Mazer and squeezes the trigger. \nX-Takk Bully seizes, freezes, crashes. Mazer barrel falls away from Krod - he's lucky to be alive. Rush stows Zap Wand, grabs Mazer and yanks Krod to his feet. \nKROD Thanks. \nRUSH I'll never let you forget it. \nKROD Rush, we're screwed!    Now everybody's after us! \nRUSH Nah, we're cool. We're with them! \nNEGABYTE BEAMS slice walls, erasing all data in their path. Rush, Flynn and Mega dive into a tunnel, escaping by inches. \n90   EXT.   FIGHTER HIDE-OUT / DATA PIPE \nRush, Mega and Flynn, pursued, rendezvous with Krod, Boole and Quantz. \nBOOLE This way!   Down the pipe! \nRush helps Krod, Quantz and Boole into a data pipe.       One by one, they WHIRL away in the flow of chromatic data. \nFlynn and Mega have a breathless moment to consider Rush. \nMEGA He's better than I thought. \nFLYNN He's been sent for a reason. \nMEGA What reason? \nFLYNN Don't know yet. Sometimes we have to trust the bigger plan. \nMega struggles to compute. \nRush turns to help Flynn down the pipe. Mega assists. Flynn's wounded leg gives out, he slips. Rush holds him, but loses his balance, slides down. \nRUSH Mega!   Quick! Jump! \nBut she hesitates - \nVELCRONIC BEAMS snag her from behind - pulling her back onto the ledge. \nRush tumbles down the flume, glancing back to see: \nMega, hauled away by X-Takk Troops. \nRUSH MEGA!!! \n(CONTINUED) \n90   CONTINUED: \nFighters, Krod, Rush and Flynn surf down the data WHIRL, accelerating away from the hot zone. \nX-Takks jump in after them, but are all swallowed by the flow - gone. \n91   INT.   FIGHTER HIDE-OUT / MAIN HALL \nBashed and ruined, littered with fallen Fighters. \nPlexor nurses his injured arm, commanding the mop-up. \nX-Takks bring Mega to their leader. \nX-TAKK 1 We got her! \nMega stands defiant. \nPlexor regards her sternly. Extends his hand to her shoulder, cupping the back of her neck. \nPLEXOR You committed a fatal error. \nDATA ENERGY SURGES from his eyes, flushing her body circuits. She fights intensifying input, but soon weakens. She glitches and shuts down, falling into the arms of X-Takks. \nPLEXOR Their strategies and tactics lie encrypted in her memory. Bring her! I will hack from her what I need. \n92   INT.   DATA PIPE NETWORK \nFlynn leads the way, surfing the chromatic hyper-speed flow with Quantz and Boole. \nRush and Krod struggle to master the technique, rolling, slipping, recovering, grabbing each other. \nRUSH I got it, I got it, I got it. \nBoole surfs around them, heading into a squirrely curve. \nKROD AWWWWWWW! \nKrod swings high, out of control.     Dumps in front of Rush, who flips him upright. \n(CONTINUED) \n92   CONTINUED: \nRUSH Shove it!    Go! \nRush and Krod swerve and gathers speed, shooting past Quantz, Boole and Flynn - pivoting to surf BACKWARDS! \nKROD I remember now! Nothing to it! \nRUSH Check it out! \nRush flips up and surfs on his hands.       Krod attempts to match the move. \nBOOLE Look out! \nRUSH What? \nFLYNN TURN AROUND! \nRush and Krod crane around to see: \nDATA PIPE spills into a massive DATA FLUME. \nRUSH & KROD AHHHHHHHH! \n102   EXT.   X-NET ARTERIES - VARIOUS \nPlexor's Cruiser speeds through a new, as-yet unused X-Net switching station. It's heavily secured. X-Takk troops defer to their supreme leader. \nPlexor veers onto a proprietary side-route, bound for: \n103   EXT.   X-NET CENTRAL SERVER \nFirewall apertures cool, anticipating Plexor's arrival. \nEncryption portal opens. \nPlexor's Cruiser glides in. \nPortal closes. \nFirewalls reactivate, blazing red-hot, sealing the fortress. \n104   INT.   X-NET CENTRAL SERVER \nTowering corridors. Powerful armored X-Takk Guards stand in pairs at every portal, corner and column. \nPlexor strides past, steps into a special GATE. Data beams react with his circuitry. Encryption key resolves. \nGate opens. \n105   INT.   PROGRAMMING CHAMBER \nPlexor strides across the spare, sleek space. \nOn a slab lies Mega, radiated from above by READER BEAMS. \n105   CONTINUED: \nPlexor considers her glowing body circuits.          Studies emerging data patterns. \nSatisfied, he halts the process.        Beams go dark. \nPLEXOR Boot up. \nMega awakens, sits up.      She sees the device, then Plexor. \nMEGA You treat me like I've been corrupted. \nPLEXOR I cannot predict the random effects Flynn might have caused in you. \nMEGA You programmed me to gather intelligence. That's all I've ever done. \nPLEXOR How long have you known Flynn? \nMEGA Enough time to gain his trust. \nPLEXOR Your behavior was highly authentic. \nMEGA To him.    It had to be. \nPLEXOR Have you allowed Flynn to complete a full interface with you? \nMEGA I am programmed to allow such access only to you, Plexor. \nHer eyes lock on him.      He is satisfied. \nPLEXOR Flynn claims to be a User.     As did the one called Rush. \nMEGA Users do not exist. \nPLEXOR You have seen nothing to make you doubt this? \n105   CONTINUED:    (2) \nMEGA Nothing. \nPLEXOR They possess no powers beyond those of routine Programs? \nMEGA I have no knowledge of such powers. \nShe steps down.     They walk out of the chamber. \nPLEXOR Still, there is something about them I cannot compute. Flynn plans to attack me, doesn't he? \nMEGA Yes. And Rush will fight by his side. \nPLEXOR Where will they strike? \nMEGA Flynn does not decide until the hour of his attack. But he trusts me completely. When he knows the place, I will know it as well. \nPLEXOR Perfect. They will be met with a final thrashing. Yes, let them come. \nThey pass through the gate, arrive in the corridor. \nMEGA Have you further instructions for me? \nPLEXOR None for now. But stay close. \nThey lock gazes.     Barcode data surges between them. \nPLEXOR You came to me full of glitches and random routines. Look at you now. What an extraordinary piece of programming I have made of you. I created X-Net to the same standard of flawless beauty. Soon, its perfection will become all that is, and all that ever will be. \n(CONTINUED) \n105   CONTINUED:    (3) \nMEGA All events remain under your control. \nBingo. \nSquare spins into a circle, latches and LIGHTS the entire Hologon lattice. Intricate 3D code patterns ANIMATES. \nFLYNN Not bad. \nKROD Good thing you didn't terminate us. \nRUSH How do we use this thing to shut down Plexor? \nFLYNN (picks up hologon) It's a copy of Plexor's master key. We can break into any X-Net facility and fry the power supply. \nRUSH But once Plexor knows we have it, he'll change the code. \nFLYNN Yep.   We've got one shot. \nRUSH Then we should take out the power supply to Plexor's main server. \nGROUP Yes! Take out Plexor's central server! \nFLYNN Hang on, guys, that's not as easy as it sounds - \nRUSH I was inside the main server, I saw how it's laid out. \nKROD I used to work there!   I'll recognize where everything is! \nCODE MONK N1J We can take it! \nCODE MONK J2R Hit Plexor where he lives! \n(CONTINUED) \n108   CONTINUED:    (3) \nFLYNN Even with this key, it won't - \nQUANTZ We can pull it off, can't we Flynn? One final assault on Plexor's central server? \nBOOLE Shut him down forever? \nAll eyes on Flynn.    Rush's naivete has ignited false hope in the Fighters. \nRUSH Of course we can. \nFlynn forces a smile. \nFLYNN Hey, the future depends on us.    How could we fail? \n109   INT.   ENCOM ADVANCED RESEARCH LAB - MOMENTS LATER \nSinclair comes off the secured elevator, finds Meg and Dewey at work on Quantum Digitizer. \nMEG It's almost fixed. I'll be able to bring back Rush soon - \nSINCLAIR Excellent work. Unfortunately, I'm shutting down this project. \nMEG What? \nSINCLAIR Something came up. The company is at stake. I can't go into details. \nMEG But Rush would have no way to return! \nSINCLAIR Meg. I will never hold you responsible. This is a tough call, but it's mine. Dismantle and destroy all of this equipment and software. Immediately. \n109   CONTINUED: \nMEG Well - \nSINCLAIR Meg...   I'm not asking. \nMEG I understand. \nHe shoots a look and exits. \n110   EXT.   CYBERSPACE - X-NET OPTIK HIGHWAY OVER DARK ZONE \nCompiler Crews work at megahertz speed. OPTIK HIGHWAYS extend and converge. Switching stations assemble. Crews shift to new assignments. \nPull wide to see dismal ground below.    Dark zone, emitting woeful blips of random energy. \nPillars descend from X-Net crews above and SMASH into the old silicon, planting themselves deep and impervious. \nRush stands on a vista point, aghast as X-Net construction dominates the landscape. \nFLYNN It's a bummer being on the losing team, huh Rush? \nFlynn sits nearby, trying to patch his corrupted leg. \nRUSH We'll trash X-Net. Then we'll go back to the our world and expose what Sinclair's done. \nHe looks at Krod, Boole, Quantz and Code Monkeys in the distance, preparing for battle. \nRUSH Do they have any idea our world exists? Do they understand what a User is? \nFLYNN Programs once connected freely with their Users. But Plexor shut down the I/O ports, severing all links. He controls all contact with the world we once knew. Programs operate on his instructions or none at all. \n(CONTINUED) \n110   CONTINUED: \nRUSH Or yours. \nFLYNN It's nothing to brag about.    We're getting our butts kicked. \nRush looks at his arms, astounded. His circuitry strobes in hues of brilliant red. Disk animates and unfolds, revealing infinite surface variations. \nRush feels new power surging inside his body. His eyes harden, keen like Tron's. Rush LEAPS BACKWARD, goes airborne, lands on a ledge high above. Amazing balance. \nKROD & FIGHTERS YES!   Excellent move, dude! \nRUSH It feels...    Awesome. \nRush's voice is a little deeper, with a digital edge.       It surprises him. \nHe cocks his disk and THROWS. \nDisk rockets across the landscape, a mile away and STRIKES an X-NET SURVEY POST, blasting it to bits. Disk arcs high, shoots back toward Rush. \nRush looks worried for a second, ready to duck - \nFLYNN Don't flinch, Rush!   It's your disk now. \nDisk snaps back into Rush's hand, painlessly.       Throbbing with energy. \nRUSH Oh man, this is good. \nRush pulls a new LIGHT WAND from a thigh bracket. It extends into a hundred-foot vaulting pole. Rush VAULTS across the canyon, lands with precision. Light pole retracts into the wand in a nanosecond. \nKROD Awwwww!   Where can I get one of those? \nAnother two vaults and a leap - Rush tosses his disk into a spiral, steps off it mid-air (like stairs), and lands perfectly - rejoining the group. \nCheers from Krod, Quantz, Boole and Code Monkeys.       Flynn shakes Rush's hand - energy surges between them. \n110   CONTINUED:    (5) \nBOOLE It's for real, Quantz. \nQUANTZ We've got a chance to take down Plexor. \n111   INT.

Any three of you could crash an army of Flynn's best. But I've prepare for his random acts by designing massive redundancy. \nWiden to reveal: \nBATTALION of X-Takks, lined in precise rows, filling the vast hall. Since Adolf Hitler, no one has displayed such an awesome military machine. \n112   INT.   PLEXOR'S INNER SANCTUM \nMega sneaks in, alone. She pulls her disk off her back and raises it above her head. Data energizes around her. She clenches hard, trying to make the connection. \nA RUBY BEAM converges off her disk, reaching skyward. \n113   INT.   REAL WORLD - ENCOM ADVANCED RESEARCH LAB - NIGHT \nMeg and Dewey work to dismantle the lab. \nMeg walks past, stops. Comes back.

CYBERSPACE - X-NET CENTRAL SERVER - MAIN HALL \nPLEXOR Cybavor programming complete? \nX-NET SPECIALIST Yes. \n(CONTINUED) \n114   CONTINUED: \nPLEXOR Demonstrate. \nX-Net Specialists drops the sides on a cubic cage. \nA frozen dog-like CYBAVOR CREATURE stands like a statue. \nPlexor nods.    X-Net Specialist activates. \nCybavor comes alive.     Circuits RAGING.    Eyes pulsing. \nPlexor summons an X-Net Worker Drone. \nPLEXOR Install yourself over there. \nWorker Drone does as he's told.       He freezes in place. \nPLEXOR Attack! \nCybavor leaps like a hyena, bounds the length of the hall. DIVES at the Worker Drone... \nAnd DEVOURS HIM mercilessly. \nEnergy sparks fly, circuits zap, as the Cybavor digest the energy, GROWS LARGER, then SPLITS DOWN THE MIDDLE (like DNA), then regrows the missing halves. \nNow the Cybavor is a PAIR of nasty, snarling Cybavors. \nPLEXOR End routine. \nCybavors sit. \nPLEXOR Elegant. \nSurveying his perfect defenses, he notices one thing missing. \nRush hurries away with Mega and Flynn. \nKrod, Quantz, Boole and Code Monkeys are besieged by a hundred X-Takks. \nKROD Whoa! Retreat! That way!     Keep firing! RUN! AHHH! \nPlexor enters the battle arena with his four CYBAVORS.     He scans keenly, then heads off another direction. \n127   INT.   X-NET GANTRY / MAIN POWER SUPPLY \nFlynn hobbles, helped by Mega.     Rush leads them around a corner, in sight of: \nMAIN POWER SUPPLY.     Massive reactive CORE CONTAINMENT CUBE. \nRush comes to the edge of a deep, narrow moat. Bottom is      a channel of ROILING, MOLTEN CHROMATIC DATA. No bridges. \nRUSH We have to get across. \nRAAAA!!! \nSix X-Takks are upon them, disks flying, NegaByte eraser beams swinging. \nFlynn Takes a hit in the chest. \nFLYNN ARRGGHH! \nRush and Mega dodge, fling their disks with lethal accuracy - \nX-Takks crash and fall, tumbling into the moat abyss, flashing as they hit the molten bottom. \n128   INT.

I know that dude! \nQuantz stuns an X-Takk Soldier - Code Monkeys hack his X-Net Armor. Armor powers down, revealing: \nKROD I-beem! \nI-beem shakes off his brainwashing. \n(CONTINUED) \n128   CONTINUED: \nI-BEEM Krod my friend! Who are these guys?! \nKROD We're taking out Plexor.    You with us or them? \nX-Takks attack the group, including I-beem. \nI-beem zaps away, reappearing next to an X-Takk. He steals the X-Takk's NEGABYTE BLASTER and mows down three X-Takks, saving trapped Boole. \nI-BEEM With you! \nI-beem joins Fighters as they press deeper, engaging the next X-Takk onslaught. \n129   INT.   X-NET POWER SUPPLY OUTER GANTRY - CONTINUOUS \nRush and Mega haul Flynn along a narrow ledge. \nFLYNN There.   You can make it across! \nHe points to a thin ledge on the other side, far below. \nRush extends his Light Pole to the ledge, moves to gather Flynn for a vault-crossing. \nFLYNN No, take Mega! I'll stay here and run interference. \nRUSH You haven't got a chance by yourself. \nFLYNN Ah, these guys are wimps. \nIt's bravado: They know his odds are dismal. Flynn slumps into an alcove, which is only big enough for him. He pulls a supply of SPIKED MINI-DISKS, ready to defend himself. \nMEGA We're not leaving you. \nFLYNN My body is weak, but my will is strong. I promise, no matter what they do to me, I'll survive this. Trust the bigger plan. \n(CONTINUED) \n129   CONTINUED: \nHe's fading fast. \nMEGA But Flynn - \nX-Takks attack along the ledge. \nFLYNN GO!   NOW! \nRush throws his arm around Mega and VAULTS across the moat, landing on the far side - gaining a slim foot-hold below a core ENTRY POINT. \nFlynn chooses his moment, leans out and throws. His mini disks take out X-Takks on the ledge. Their bodies tumble into the moat, flashing as they hit. \nRUSH Your software has the biggest flaw there is, Plexor. You can't see you own mistakes. \nPlexor snatches his Death-disk, corners Rush for the kill. \nMega's disk crashes silicon, comes at Plexor - But his defense field repels it. He slams it aside and it's raked away by downward flowing energy rings. \nRush DIVES at PLEXOR. He's like a statue. But this time RUSH holds him and infuses tron-energy, breaking down Plexor's defense field, eating into his body circuits. It's fractal zapping fireworks - evenly matched foes battling face-to- face. \nRUSH Do it Mega! \nMega scoops HOLOGON off floor, makes for CONTROL CELL - \nPlexor's hand shoots out, GRABS HER, stops her like iron. \nPlexor exerts his power, holds Rush and Mega by the throats with his two hands, backing them toward a surface ripping with HOT ENERGY RINGS. \nRush and Mega struggle, an inch from death - \nZAAAAAA - \nPlexor stops, annoyed.      Turns and sees: \nKrod, Fighters and I-beem have arrived, firing blasters at Plexor's SPINAL NEXUS. It hardly makes a dent, but it creates a fleeting opportunity for Rush - \nRush ducks forward, SHOOTS his disk off his back, smacking Plexor in the throat. Mega falls clear - \nRush hurls Plexor against energy rings - Energy rakes down his body, but he fights the effects an DOES NOT MELT DOWN.

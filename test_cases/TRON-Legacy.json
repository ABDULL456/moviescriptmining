Pulsing chromatics over jet black. \nCONSTRUCTION CREW toils to complete a vast SWITCHING NEXUS. CYPER-TECH CREWMEN and MACHINERY branded \"X-NET\". \n3D lattice of routers, refractors, reassemblers... New, unused data OPTIK HIGHWAY routes radiate from all sides, crossing cyberspace. \nX-Net Tactical Corps troops (herein X-Takks) patrol every inch. \n2   INT.   X-NET NEXUS - UNDER CONSTRUCTION \nDATA \"TRAIN\" enters. Sliver of RED DATA ENERGY shunt off, shooting into RANDOM MEMORY BUFFER - geometrically perfect lattice of PLASMA BEAMS and WHITE HOT intersection points. \nX-Takks notice, moving to investigate. \nDEEP IN THE LATTICE: \nRed data \"uploads\" into solid form. A RED FIGURE. We see from the back - infrared strobing DISK, etched metallic detail, lethal EDGES - \nThen slowly he - IT - turns.     Hardly a face, only data-hungry eyes, riveted to a TASK - \nTRON 2.0. \nSeriously upgraded, over-clocked, armed for trouble. The friendly hero we once knew has been re-programmed into a ruthless cyber-ninja. \nX-Takks search ten story gantries. \nTRON springs into the lattice, dodging PLASMA BEAMS, avoiding detection. Slips into: \n3   INT.   NEXUS MAIN SHAFT \nX-Takks on high alert. \nTRON slips down main shaft, freezes, confirms data.       Darts behind MAIN POWER SUPPLY. \nPulls his DISK.     DISK opens, extends oscillating DATA KEY. \n(CONTINUED) \n3   CONTINUED: \nTRON inserts key in and ENCRYPTION PANEL.     Circuits energize. Shockwave quakes system. \nPOWER SUPPLY OVERLOADS, SHORTING OUT. \nX-Takks spot TRON. \nX-TAKKS Intruder!   Fix coordinates! \nPOLICE POUNCE, FIRING. \nTron pulls hyper-disk off his back and HURLS IT - \nDISK strikes cop, fries his circuits. Disk ricochets, brutally accurate, takes out three more Police - \nTRON flips into the air - His DISK boomerangs straight for him. Certain death. But his timing is inhumanly accurate. DISK docks on his back midair, lands and bolts. \nALARMS WAIL - \nPOWER SUPPLY VERGES on MELTDOWN, CIRCUITS FRY, PLASMA SPEWS. X-NET CRISIS TEAM rushes in, inserts MASTER KEY. POWER SUPPLY STABILIZES. Catastrophe averted. \nTRON flips away, chased by firing X-Takks - \nArriving on the scene - split-second response: \nElite team of X-NET SECURITY AGENTS, lead by: \nRX23 SECURITY LEADER (Cyber-twin of our real-world hero RUSH). \nTRON jumps down MAIN SHAFT - a thousand stories. Riding his DISK as a heat shield dodges X-Net fire, swerves into a DATA CHANNEL - \nRX23 and a pair of his AGENTS hop on PULSE RIDER vehicles, hotly pursuing TRON. \nTRON PLUNGES onto a DATA HIGHWAY - speed out of NEXUS, hurls across cyberspace. \nAGENT 1 This is the first time an Intruder has broken into X-Net! \nRX23 LEADER And it's the last. Follow him! Shut him down! \nThey speed onto the OPTIK HIGHWAY. \n4   INT.   X-NET OPTIK HIGHWAY \nBroadband, light-speed OPTIK HIGHWAY.     Empty, except for: \nTRON - accelerating, escaping. \nRx23 and AGENTS catch up fast on Pulse Rider Vehicles. \nTRON throws his disk. Blings off Agents - triggers CRASH. PLASMA BLAST rips open highway wall. \nRx23 emerges unscathed, pursuing. \n5   EXT.   CYBERSPACE - ANCIENT SYSTEM ZONE \nTRON leaps out blast hole, recovers his disk, vanishes into ANCIENT SYSTEM ZONE. \nBut Tron suddenly brakes, quitting the chase. \nRX23 is puzzled.    Looks forward.       Eyes spring wide. \n12   INT.   REAL WORLD - ENCOM CORPORATION BETA TEST LAB - DAY \nRush's screen:   His Pulse Rider speeds straight for the rocks. \nRUSH Yikes! \n13   CYBERSPACE - GAME GRID \nPulse Rider smashes into rocks, RX23 pulverizes to neon bits. Electro SHOCKWAVE sears across game grid. Search Engine freezes overhead, glitches and CRASHES like a blimp. \nAll goes white - snow crash. \n14   INT.   REAL WORLD - ENCOM BETA TEST LAB - DAY \nRUSH He crashed me! \nNERDS FUBAR!    Bad Thing!   Flame War! \nRUSH Miles.    Did you get a trace on him?! \nMiles stares at his blank screen.     Blinking.    Every screen in the lab is blank. \nPHLEGMAN We are so screwed. \nKELTER Who tells the boss? \nAll eyes land on Rush. \nRUSH Get the system back up!     Now!    Move! \n15   EXT.   LAWN OF ENCOM CORPORATE CAMPUS - DAY \nPRESS CREWS camp a block away. \nX-Net PR TEAM preps a media extravaganza. Shirt logo: \"X- NET = TOTAL DATA SECURITY\" Banners, video projections, music. \nX-NET PUBLIC RELATIONS VP leads entourage on a preview. \n15   CONTINUED: \nPR VP Weather is holding. Dress rehearsal on for 6PM. In the morning, we let the press in for a 7AM tech set-up, then you go live worldwide 9 AM sharp. \nStaff defers to: GORDON SINCLAIR (45), boyish, ruthless, brilliant CEO of Encom Corporation. \nSINCLAIR Delay the press until 8:30. I'll taking the stage at 8:50. Force a network break-in. Then it's news. \nHe catches something on a video screen, snaps his fingers. \nSINCLAIR Play that again. \nCrew murmurs on headsets.    Promo video replays: \nVIDEO PLAYBACK X-Net deploys radical software design, constructs proprietary white-hot firewalls, unleashes virus killer apps. Creating the most secure data network in history. Your data can never again be hacked, corrupted, stolen or destroyed. X-Net is the final solution, totally guaranteed 99.999% secure data transmission - \nSINCLAIR Who changed that? Who put \"99.999\"? \nX-Net executives chill. \nPR VP Um, that would be...    Legal. \nEyes land on withering LEGAL VP. \nSINCLAIR Change it back to the way I wrote it. With the launch of X-Net, this company guarantees one hundred percent secure data transmission. If we can't deliver on that promise, we deserve to be out of business. \nRush appears from a building.       Signals Sinclair aside. \nSINCLAIR What can't wait, Rush? \n(CONTINUED) \n15   CONTINUED:    (2) \nRUSH Um. X-Net was just breached by a hacker. \nSINCLAIR goes pale. \nRUSH System's back up, no permanent damage, but... But whoever's behind this, they're good, and they're still out there. \n16   INT.   SINCLAIR'S OFFICE - DAY \nSprawling, big bucks, basketball hoop. \nSinclair enters, alone. Closes door. Uses a retinal scan ID to access his computer. Secure connection opens. As he speaks, text instantly appears: \nSINCLAIR Identify the intruder. \n17   EXT.   CYBERSPACE \nFlashing circuitry, machine code bit-storm.     We follow Sinclair's text message data stream \nMin-blowing cyberspace fly-over. \nDATA BEAM penetrates a towering shaft, reaching deep inside the MASSIVELY FORTIFIED X-NET CENTRAL SERVER. \n18   INT.   CYBERSPACE - X-NET CENTRAL SERVER / INNER SANCTUM \nLONE FIGURE stands clothed in flashy cyber-armor:     Fluid photons, oozing high-rez circuitry. \nIt's PLEXOR, cyber-twin of real-world Sinclair. \nSINCLAIR We don't have 20 hours. This problem needs to be gone before tomorrow 9AM. Come on people, this company's future is at stake! It's time to think without a box! \nMinds ponder grimly. Finally, a lone VP rises.      It's RUDY, the company Archivist. \nRUDY At a time like this, let's seek inspiration in the past. We should ask ourselves: What solution would spring from the inspired mind of our departed leader, Flynn. \n(CONTINUED) \n23   CONTINUED:    (3) \nHe's got an obituary photo of FLYNN, Encom's legendary previous - and deceased - CEO. \nGroans around the table. Execs rolls their eyes, disses Rudy's idea. Flynn has become a stale company joke. \nRudy sheepishly sits. \nBut Sinclair stops behind Rudy, eyes fixed on the photo of Flynn. An idea takes hold. He looks to Meg. \nSINCLAIR Is the QF-401 is operational? \nMEG Um...   Midway into phase one testing. \nConfusion among execs.     Nobody knows what a \"QF-401\" is. Not even Rush. \nSINCLAIR If we can't fight this intruder from the outside, then maybe we need to fight him from the inside. \nMeg's mind races. \nMEG I'm ready to do my part. \nSINCLAIR This company needs a hero. Who among you is the smartest, most resourceful and courageous? \nLooks trade around the table.     Meg slowly rises, indicating her choice. \nMEG Who else could it be? \nShe's singled out Rush. \n24   INT.   ENCOM CORP CORRIDOR - SECURE ELEVATOR - DAY \nMeg leads Sinclair and Rush to a SECURE ELEVATOR.     Her retinal scan ID opens the door. They step in. \n25   INT.   ENCOM SECURE ELEVATOR - GOING DOWN - MOMENTS LATER \nRUSH Somebody going to tell me what I've been volunteered for? \n(CONTINUED) \n25   CONTINUED: \nSINCLAIR Rush, you're the only one I can trust to eliminate the intruder. But you won't be doing it the way you thought. Meg's been working on something down here that's, well... Beyond Top Secret. \nRush drills a look at Meg, but she keeps it all business. \n26   INT.   ENCOM ADVANCED RESEARCH LAB - MOMENTS LATER \nOut the elevator, Meg leads them into a maze of ultra-tech gear. \nMEG This is where Flynn worked.   And where he died. \nAmid sleek new equipment, there's a glass cabinet housing a CHARRED REMNANT of strange machinery. \nSINCLAIR Meg has reconstructed Flynn's last project. This time it works. \nMega signals lab assistant DEWEY. He pokes buttons:       A MASSIVE TECHNICAL DEVICE unfolds and boots up. \nRUSH You didn't pick this up at Circuit City. What is it? \nMEG A Quantum Digitizer. Prototype, only one of its kind. Flynn designed it to break down physical objects into high resolution data. Luckily, we salvaged his key components and back-engineered the system. \nShe opens a cage, places her LAB RAT (Jo-Jo) on a target stage. Dewey boots controls, presses commands. Beam array scans the rat into the computer, forming a 3D rat-image on screens, dematerializing the physical rat. Device revs down. \nRush runs his hand over the empty target stage. \nRUSH That's...   Not possible. \nLab rat has vanished from the physical world.     Its digitized image rotates on monitors. \n(CONTINUED) \n26   CONTINUED: \nMEG Flynn was trying to take it one step further. He wanted to transport a human being into cyberspace. \nRUSH You mean the urban legends? A computer sucked Flynn into cyberspace a long time ago. \nSINCLAIR We think it happened. \nMeg agrees.    Rush gets a chill. \nSINCLAIR It was a fluke. But Flynn worked for years, down here, trying to make it happen again. One day a test went bad. A plasma reaction destroyed this lab. Flynn was reduced to ash. \nRush views the charred remains in the glass case. Photos of the destroyed lab. Spooky evidence of a hellish death scene. \nRUSH I was never told how he died. It was all just weird, you know, because Flynn's the guy who hired me. But he was strange, kept to himself, I didn't know what job I was supposed to be doing. (to Sinclair) Then you came onboard, the company woke up, we had a direction. It was kind of pathetic, because by the time Flynn died, everybody was too busy to care. \nSINCLAIR He was brilliant in his way, but genius without discipline leads to nothing. His reckless habits nearly ruined this company... And for sure got him killed. \nA last look at the charred remains of Flynn's machine. \nMEG That kind of accident can't happen again. We've upgraded the system in ways Flynn never could. The chips didn't exist until now. \n(CONTINUED) \n38   CONTINUED: \nSINCLAIR Tron? Wasn't Tron one of our programs? \nSinclair and Meg trade baffled looks. \n39   INT.   CYBERSPACE - X-NET NEXUS \nPlexor oversees construction.     X-Takk Commander points to something in the distance. \nBeyond the horizon, the RUBY RED BEAM reaches to the heavens. \nPlexor sees it, alarmed. \n40   EXT.   CYBERSPACE - ANCIENT I/O PORT - MORNING \nText forms in magenta circuitry - GOOD WORK PARTNER. \nRUSH I have a plan to crash Tron. \nMega turns with alarm. \nMEGA ABORT! \nWalls THUNDER and CRASH IN - \nRush leaps clear with his disk - \nMASSIVE ROMBALL (data reformatting orb) hurtles around the I/O Port, ZAPPING all it touches, de-rezzing data structures into neutral gray \"blank matter\". \nROMBALL loops skyward. \nGIANT D-REZZ PROGRAM crashes down from above, retrieves ROMBALL - He's ENORMOUS, TOUGH, SINGLE-MINDED. \n41   INT.   ENCOM CORPORATION - SINCLAIR'S OFFICE - DAY \nSinclair and Meg hang on the broken transmission: \nMEG Rush? \nWords appear:    END OF LINE. \nSINCLAIR He'd better not fail. \n42   EXT.   ANCIENT COMPUTER SYSTEM I/O PORT \nD-Rezz screams like a modem, hurls ROMBALL - \nMega and Krod dive clear - \nROMBALL misses them, but BLAZES DOWN two more I/O Ports.        D- rezz retrieves ROMBALL, bears down on Mega and Krod. \nRUSH Hey! Double points if you nail me! Bring it on! \nD-Rezz turns his ugly sights on Rush, baited away from Mega and Krod. \nD-rezz flexes and ROARS, revealing an X-NET LOGO on his chest. \nRUSH Stop!    End your routine! \nD-rezz corners Rush, hurls his ROMBALL - Ball fires every circuit in its path, bleaching away data energy. \nRush dodges - \nRUSH Cease!    Desist! We're on the same team! \nMega throws her disk, plings D-rezz on the skull.      D-rezz turns on her - \nRush runs, LEAPS on D-Rezz's back.      Like riding a gorilla - \nD-Rezz flips Rush to the ground, pins him with one mighty hand, raises his ROMBALL for the kill. \nRUSH I'm X-Net too! \nData flows from Rush's body, up D-Rezz's clamping arm. Radiant energy between predator and prey. \nDigits race in D-rezz's eyes. A code unlocks. He looks down, finally registering the X-Net markings on Rush's outfit. \nD-Rezz lets go of Rush, slumps back on his haunches.       Lowers his head in shame. \nRUSH No, hey, hey big guy, don't take it so hard. We all have bad days. \n(CONTINUED) \n42   CONTINUED: \nRUSH rolls the BIG ROMBALL over:     A peace offering. \nMega and Krod cautiously approach. \nMEGA He was carrying out his programming. All I/O Ports are scheduled for de- rezz. \nD-rezz hears this, happy to be understood.       (He never talks.) \nKROD Easy, big guy. No harm, no foul. \nRUSH D-Rezz, we can use a guy with your raw power. You ready to be a hero for X-Net? \nD-Rezz stands, clutches his ROMBALL.       Reporting for duty. \nKROD Cool. Now I've got somebody I can boss around. \nD-rezz modem-growls at Krod. \nI-Beem stiffens, reflexively vigilant. He scans the four of them again, finally softening. He zaps to a wall near his giant barrier, then proudly pushes aside a thin panel. Beyond a corridor of game gear, view expanses to reveal: \n44   EXT.   OLD GAME GRID \nRush steps across the vast vector-graphic grid surface. \nEerie.   Quiet.     Pure. \nMega, I-Beem, Krod and D-rezz follow. \nMEGA This region is obsolete. \nRush kneels, touches grid lines.    Circuits energize, as his energy surges in all directions.    He draws in data. \nRUSH There's bits of Tron's code all over. Krod, give D-Rezz and I-beem the escape coordinate Tron used on me. \nKrod's eyes flash data to I-Beem and D-rezz.      \"Tr165444.018\". \n(CONTINUED) \n44   CONTINUED: \nI-BEEM Coordinate captured. \nD-Rezz nods, palming his Romball. \nRUSH That's where Tron will bail out. We'll make sure he needs to. Go set up the trap. (to D-rezz) You only get one shot at this, big guy. Stop him but don't destroy him, right? He's got data I need. \nD-rezz grips Romball, grunts affirmation.    He and I-beem head for the perimeter of the grid. \nMEGA If this is Tron's territory, he'll know we're here. He'll hide. \nRUSH He can't resist a grudge match. He'll take risks trying to beat me. That's how we trip him up. (to Krod) Whip it out. \nRush unsheathes his LIGHT WAND. \nKrod pulls out his own LIGHT WAND. \nThey both look at Mega. \nShe's got no light wand. \nKROD You didn't bring one? \nMEGA I don't have one. \nKROD Hey, not a problem - \nKrod holds his light wand forward, activates it.    LIGHT CYCLE up-rezzes under him. He revs it, ready to go. \nKROD (to Mega) - Hop on! \nRUSH Hang on, Krod. \n(CONTINUED) \n44   CONTINUED:    (2) \nRush activates his light wand. LIGHT CYCLE up-rezzes under him, with a special two tier seat for a second rider. \nRUSH I upgraded my unit. \nKROD You are awesome, man.    I hate you. \nMega considers. There's more on her mind she's not talking about. She smiles at Rush, climbs on back of his light cycle. \nMEGA Mmmm...   Hack me. \nA nod between Rush and Rush - they TAKE OFF. \nLIGHT CYCLES shoot across grid surface. \nMega screams and clutches Rush, throwing her body against his, clamping her arms around him. \nKrod and Rush turn 90 degrees, rallying, passing each other, getting warmed up. It's familiar territory. \nLight cycles race toward each other on the same line. \nMega holds Rush tight, eyes filling with terror. \nMEGA Resource conflict!    Fatal crash imminent! \nBut Krod and Rush slow their light cycles with expert skill, rolling safely to a halt, nose-to-nose. Directly over: \nA BIG RED DOT.      The only dot on the grid. \nGrid Center. \nMega, Rush and Krod raise up to scan the horizon.        It's all clear flat grid to the horizon. \nRUSH Any sign of him? \nKROD Everything looks the same to me. Everything looks the same. The same. The same. \nRUSH Krod, snap out of it. \n44   CONTINUED:    (3) \nMEGA Tron will never expose himself. \nThey watch, wait, pivot. \nKROD The same... \nRUSH WHY DID YOU DO THAT?! \nMEGA I-    I GOT SCARED! \nKrod shoots gap.      D-rezz is ready to smash him with his Romball. \nI-BEEM No!   It's Krod! Tron is OVER THERE! \nD-rezz makes mental switch, hurls Romball. \nRomball bounces down solid rock, onto game grid, rolls with ferocious speed, DIAGONALLY across the grid. \nRomball curves to track Tron - like a great bowling shot. \nRomball clips rear wheel of Tron's lightcycle.       Lightcycle vaporizes. Tron skids and tumbles. \nI-beem zaps beside Rush and Mega.       Krod and D-rezz join them. \n(CONTINUED) \n49   CONTINUED:    (2) \nKROD There he goes! \nTron climbs over rocks, escaping through a TUNNEL. \nRUSH We've got him now.    Let's go! \nWHOOSH! Electro-fire Romball careens across grid, bearing down on them. \nGroup DIVES CLEAR. \nD-rezz swings in a foot, stopping the Romball - inches short of mowing down Krod. \nKROD I could have done that. \nHe strobes, freezes, hits the deck. \n50   INT.   ANCIENT COMPUTER SYSTEM TUNNEL \nStalking their prey:       Rush, Krod, I-beem and D-rezz. \nMEGA We can't go any further. \nAhead, vast old circuitry has been \"eaten through\" by dull throbbing greenish MEMORY LEAKAGE. Paths of unaffected material are narrow and maze-like. \nRUSH What is it? \nKROD Don't ask, dude. \nMEGA It's a memory leak, once it starts, it infects everything. \nI-BEEM Touch it and you crash forever.     We cannot risk it. \nMEGA I agree. \nD-rezz grunts. \nKROD Then it's settled. \n50   CONTINUED: \nKrod turns to head home. \nRUSH Stop. Listen to me. You might not believe there's a world outside of this one, but let's just say a guy named Sinclair is depending on me. If Tron got through here, then I can too. Who's with me? \nD-rezz steps forward, then I-Beem.      Shamed, Krod joins them. Finally, Mega makes it unanimous. \nRUSH Good. I-beem, take D-rezz, see what's up ahead. We'll guard this portal until you come back. \nI-beem and D-rezz buddy up and depart on a recon mission. \nKrod pulls off his disk, nervously practices boomerang throws. \nRUSH Better show me how to use mine. \nKROD No problem. It's all in the velocity- vector ratio. \nRush pulls the disk off his own back.      He throws - disk flies wild - he runs to retrieve it. \nMega retreats to a side area, partially eroded by memory leakage. She finds the remnants of COM CIRCUITRY and stares data beams into its transducer. \nINTERCUT WITH: \n51   EXT.   X-NET NEXUS UNDER CONSTRUCTION - PLEXOR'S VEHICLE \nPlexor's vehicle circuitry forms image of Mega. \nPLEXOR Report. \nMEGA We interfaced with Tron.   He escaped into a dark zone. \n52   INT.   ANCIENT COMPUTER SYSTEM TUNNEL \nAround a corner, Rush comes to retrieve his disk.       He pauses to eavesdrop on Mega's communication: \n(CONTINUED) \n52   CONTINUED: \nPLEXOR The Random One has proven effective? \nMEGA He is all glitches and bad data. He virtually got us de-rezzed. I recommend we terminate this mission. \nRUSH Ouch! \n(CONTINUED) \n53   CONTINUED: \nHis ankle.    He straightens, standing in front of D-rezz. \nLays eyes on Tron. \nRUSH Hey!   Pick on somebody your own size! \nD-rezz is twice as big as either of them. \nTron's eyes are cold, lifeless, calculating.       Scanning his new opponent without success. \nRUSH You've got no data on me. \nRush pulls his disk off his back, poised for a duel. \nTron moves with calculation, grips his hyper-etched disk. Circling his prey. \nThrows again - \nBRRANGG - \nRush DUCKS - \nTron's disk slams D-rezz.     D-rezz tries to catch the disk, but he's just too slow. \nRush throws his disk. Beginner's luck - it banks off a wall and nearly smacks Tron. Rush snags it on the way back, before it tumbles into memory leakage. \nTron jumps up two levels.     Retrieves his disk. \nRUSH D-rezz, pull me up! \nD-rezz hoists Rush up.     Fingers grab upper deck. \nTron jockeys for position.     Throws disk - \nDisk strikes D-rezz in the ribs.     Blast damage. \nD-rezz loses footing. \nRush grabs upper level. \nD-rezz slips toward memory leakage. \nRush grabs D-rezz's hand - he weighs a ton. \nMega, Krod and I-beem can't get here to help - \n53   CONTINUED:    (2) \nRUSH Hang on, man! HANG ON! \nBut D-rezz's big hand slips out of Rush's. \nD-rezz PLUMMETS into memory leakage, zapping away in a blaze of glory - \nRUSH NOOOO! \nHe comes to his feet, facing Tron.       Determined. \nRUSH I know who you are. Encom security program Tr856 - TRON! \nTron pauses.    Processes. \nRUSH Who is your User?? \nTron glitches at the question. \nRUSH Who programmed you?? I know your encryption code. Tell me your User or I shut you down. \nTron throws his disk. \nRush dodges. He sends waves of data energy through floor circuits, reaching into Tron's body. \nRUSH I can shut you down with a nine digit code. WHO IS YOUR USER?? 392 - \nTron's body animates painfully, as the first three code digits click into place. \nTron FLIPS away, breaking contact with floor.        Data transfer stops. Tron steals away through a tunnel. \nRush pursues. \nKrod, Mega and I-beem clamber for a way to follow. \n54   INT.   OBSOLETE COMPUTER GAME ARENA \nCircular, riddled with memory leaks. \nRush hurries to the center.       No sign of Tron. \n(CONTINUED) \n54   CONTINUED: \nRUSH Tell me, Tron! Who programmed you? Here's your encryption code! 3-6-2- \nRush sends data coursing into floor circuits. It radiates up walls, across bridges... And finds TRON in hiding. \nData races into Tron's body. Six code numbers engage; he glitches. He LEAPS to breaks the contact, flinging his disk - \nRUSH Yeah, I'm a User. A superior being. The first to enter this realm. And you are - ? \nFigure's circuitry lights.         Finally, we see the face... \nIt is FLYNN. \nFLYNN The first. \nRUSH Flynn.   How can you be here? \n54   CONTINUED:    (4) \nKROD You know this dude? \nRUSH Yeah, he's a lunatic! \nI-beem panics, zaps away in an energy beam. He reforms further along for a \"breath\", then zaps further away. Three FINITY FIGHTERS chase him. \nRush is amazed to find him self in the presence of Encom's former leader. \nFlynn comes closer, recognizing Rush. \nFLYNN Rush Nortebi. I remember hiring you. \nThey are equally dumbfounded. \nKROD Somebody tipped these guys off about us. \nMEGA Not soon enough. \nFighters step aside, Mega enters, furious at Rush. \nMEGA You weren't supposed to beat Tron. I thought for sure he'd finish you. \nRUSH Thanks. \nMEGA You destroyed our last hope! \nKROD I detect a pattern in her behavior. \nRUSH She's a spy. \nMega and Rush ooze mutual contempt.    Rush turns on Flynn. \nRUSH No wonder I couldn't figure it out. I assumed Tron User was on the outside! If I'd known this, I would blown past him and come straight for you. \n(CONTINUED) \n54   CONTINUED:    (5) \nFlynn yanks Tron's disk from Rush, peers over the precipice. Below, the last of Tron is consumed by memory leakage. \nFlynn ponders Tron's lifeless disk. He falters on his bad leg. Mega throws an arm around to help him stand. Melancholy energy courses between them. \nMEGA I failed our cause. \nFLYNN You did everything you could. \nThey know each other well. \nRush registers jealousy, but larger concerns prevail: \nRUSH Flynn never died... (dawning) Because your Quantum Digitizer worked. That's how you got here... I know - that's how I got here too. \nFlynn studies Rush, anger rising. \nFLYNN The day after I hired you, you start sucking up to Sinclair. You thought I didn't know. Bet he offered your a partnership for this, right? You have no idea the damage you've done. \nRUSH I'm only getting started. Man, you were the company joke. Now I see why. You melted down your lab to take this little joyride. You got stuck here so all you can do is wreck other people's hard work. \nFLYNN Open your eyes, geek. My lab was rigged. My \"death\" was no accident. I pushed the button just in time to escape... Almost in time. \nHe indicates his deformed leg.     Mega, Krod and the others listen with awed bewilderment.     These two guys speak of a world unknown to them. \nRUSH You're paranoid. Who would want you dead? \n(CONTINUED) \n54   CONTINUED:    (6) \nFLYNN The same guy I programmed Tron to shut down. Same one you've been sucking up to. Sinclair. And his cyber-henchman, Plexor. \nMalicious grumbles from Fighters. \nRUSH Too many of your brain cells have gotten zapped in here, old man. \nFLYNN Rush, you lamer! You've been working for the bad guy. \nThree Fighters return from the I-beem pursuit.      Empty-handed. \nFIGHTER ONE He got away. \nFlynn scowls at Rush. Sin number two.       Flynn slips Tron's dead disk in a special case. \nFLYNN Let's move. X-Net goons will soon be all over this place. \n55   EXT.   GAME GRID \nEnergy zaps across grid, forming into I-beem.

ANCIENT COMPUTER SYSTEM -      DEMOLISHED I/O PORTS \nI-beem de-rezzes, reforms, zaps himself toward the nearest X- Net OPTIK HIGHWAY. \nFlynn hastens their journey. \nMEGA Rush was trying to expose us! \nFLYNN They didn't see us.   Keep moving! \nMega, Boole and Quantz move along, shoving Krod and Rush. \nRUSH We've got to tell people on the outside - \nFLYNN Plexor shut down all the I/O ports. Only HE communicates with the outside. Sinclair holds all the cards. \nFlynn turns on Rush - one of Sinclair's cards. \nFLYNN How did you get here?! \nRUSH Megan Randall sent me. (points out Mega) Her User. She fixed your lab and sent me here to take out Tron. \nFLYNN Megan Randall? I remember her. Smart, wise beyond her years. I can't believe she'd fall for Sinclair's lies. \nHe glances at Mega, then shoves Rush along. \n67   INT.   FIGHTER HIDE-OUT \nFlynn, Mega, Fighters bring Rush and Krod into the clandestine Fighter base. Like a wartime casualty center, with corrupted Fighter Programs lining corridors. \nRUSH What happened to them? \nMEGA Try to attack Plexor head-on, this is what happens. Because of you, there will be millions more. \n(CONTINUED) \n67   CONTINUED: \nThey arrive at a laser-barred JAIL BLOCK, where a dozen BIG X-Takk Troops are held prisoner. \nFLYNN Lock up these two. We'll hold them for ransom. Or use them for target practice. \nFlynn and Mega turn to go.      Boole and Quantz use PROD LANCES to herd Rush and Krod. \nRUSH Flynn. You think I'm Sinclair's flunky, but I'm not. \nFlynn pauses.    Rush speaks low, so X-Net Captives can't hear. \nRUSH I'm sorry about Tron. \nKROD Yeah, we're - Sorry? \nRUSH We were just doing a job, we had no way of knowing the truth. \nKROD No way at all. \nRUSH Flynn, I was wrong about you. You've been doing the right thing in here. Plexor has to be shut down. Sinclair has to be exposed. \nKROD Like he said. \nRUSH Krod and I are ready to help. \nKROD We are? \nFlynn puzzles over Rush. \nFLYNN Mega, what do you read in him? \nMega circles Rush, scanning his circuits. \nMEGA Independent operating instructions. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n67   CONTINUED:    (2) \nMEGA (CONT'D) He will act as necessary to increase probability of his own survival. \nRUSH You don't know me. \nMEGA He cannot to be trusted. \nRUSH Trust?! You're the one who's been lying to me the whole time! \nRush points a finger at Mega - BOLT of ATTRACTION ENERGY shoots off his finger, ZAPS her on the nose. \nMega's circuits OVERLOAD, she flies back - \nRush, startled, looks at his finger. \nFighters muscle Rush and Krod away. \nFlynn holds Mega, anger re-ignited. \nFLYNN Mega's been risking her existence for our cause, lamer. That's more than you'll ever do. (to Fighters) Lock them away! \nFighters toss Rush and Krod in the JAIL BLOCK with the BIG X- TAKK soldiers. Does finger-signs, body circuit language. \nKROD Yo, s'up?     Eh... X-Net rules, man. \nRUSH Hey Krod...     Shut down. \nRush peers out of his cage, watching Mega go.        She turns for a final scowl, then exits. \n68   EXT.   X-NET CENTRAL SERVER - EVENING \nX-Takk Troops sound alert. \nSINCLAIR That's impossible. \nPLEXOR Flynn commanded the intruder Tron. \nSINCLAIR You've got to be wrong about this. \nPLEXOR I was programmed error-free.      By you. \nSinclair ponders the unimaginable. \nSINCLAIR Flynn...     escaped?! \nPLEXOR He leads a group who seek to prevent the opening of X-Net. The one called Rush has joined them. \n72   CONTINUED: \nSINCLAIR Rush? My guy? What lies has Flynn filled him with? \nPLEXOR Or what truths? \nSinclair peers at the screen text, agitation growing. A news article pops up, recounting the lab accident and Flynn's \"death\". X-Net launch countdown ticks. \nSINCLAIR This world can never know all I have done. You have a plan to contain Flynn? \nPLEXOR Of course. \nSINCLAIR Don't just contain him.    Destroy him. \nPLEXOR Instructions received.    And the one called Rush? \nSinclair mulls for two seconds, then: \nSINCLAIR He knows too much. Get rid of him. \nPLEXOR Instructions received. \n73   INT.   JAIL BLOCK \nRush and Krod get chummy with cell-mate X-Takks.

Never let them get to your weak spot. \n(CONTINUED) \n73   CONTINUED: \nKrod twists around, playing with his spinal nexus. \nKROD Gurfle!   I never knew that. \nPull back to see: \nFlynn secretly observes Rush.     Pondering.    Boole arrives behind him. \nBOOLE We're ready for you now. \nThey head upstairs. \n74   INT.   FIGHTER HIDE-OUT \nFlynn reviews Fighter training. Troops throw disks, battle in pairs, repair weapons, tweak armor circuitry. \nFlynn carries Tron's dark disk, contemplating it.       He moves past a line-up of his finest Fighters. \nFLYNN If X-Net is allowed to open it's the beginning of the end of a free and open cyberspace. We can't let Plexor get away with this. Our game plan has not changed. Tron was specially programmed to break into X-Net and shut down power supplies. We would then exploit these weak points and cripple the system. Tron's role was essential One of you must take his place. \nHe holds up Tron's disk. \nFLYNN Who among you can power Tron's disk and carry out his mission? \nAll Fighters take a step forward. \nFLYNN It's the most dangerous job. If you're not up for it, nobody's going to blame you. \nAll stand firm. \nFlynn lays Tron's disk in the first Fighter's hands. Fighter summons his will, causing the disk to glow faintly. But it soon goes dark again. \n74   CONTINUED: \nNext Fighter holds the disk, bearing down, animating the circuits... But he buckles and the disk falls dims. \nMega worries: One-by-one, Fighters fail to power Tron's disk. Flynn reaches the end of the line. \nMega puts her hands out to receive the disk. \nFlynn hesitates, then hands her Tron's disk. \nMega clenches it, concentrating deeply. Her energy infuses the disk, animating its circuits stronger than anyone. \nBur soon, her eyes strobe, her body circuits overload. \nShe lets go.    Tron's disk thunks the floor, goes dark. \nMega hardens her resolve. \nMEGA There are other ways to crash Plexor. I will return to him, he still trusts me. I will get close and crash him with direct contact - \n(CONTINUED) \n82   CONTINUED: \nKROD She's with Flynn!       I mean, totally WITH Flynn -! \nRUSH (cuts off Krod, covers) Flynn was smart enough to interrogate her first. \nKROD Right. \nPLEXOR (duped) She contains sensitive data. Flynn cannot be allowed to hack her. \nRush and Krod notice: Behind Plexor and his Soldiers, BOOLE, QUANTZ and FINITY FIGHTERS move into position. They signal Rush and Krod not to blow their cover. Rush makes Krod comply. An ambush is ready to spring. \nRUSH Yeah, only -     We kicked Flynn's butt, too. \nKROD You should have seen it.       Flynn won't be a problem. \nX-Takk Prisoners are confused. \nPLEXOR Then...   Why were you imprisoned? \nX-TAKK Ambush! \nFighters POUNCE, throwing disks - \nRush grabs a PROD LANCE, nails two X-Takks on their spinal nexus. They go down hard. \nPLEXOR Delete them all! \nPlexor hurls an ENERGY BALL - Rush DUCKS, grazed by its FRACTAL comet trail. \nFighters beat back Plexor.         His concerns shift.    He ducks into an ascension shaft - \nRush and Krod are left fighting back-to-back, out-manned three-to-one. \n83   INT.   FIGHTER HIDE-OUT ASCENSION SHAFT \nPlexor races upward, but is blocked by a unit of Fighters. \nPlexor pulls off his special TRIANGULAR DEATH DISK - FLINGS it. Disk ricochets off three Fighters, knocking them out. Another lethal fling and the remains Fighters fall. \nPlexor retrieves his death-disk with heart-stopping accuracy, darts into: \n84   INT.   FIGHTER HIDE-OUT MAIN ARENA \nPLEXOR It's a TRAP! \nX-Takk Troops react, bolting for their Cruisers. \nFloor circuits ACTIVATE -     X-Takks ZAP and FREEZE. \nFighters appear from all directions. \nDisks fly - \nX-Takks wield stout MAZER weapons - \nEven the corrupted Fighter Programs pitch in, working in clever teams, chipping away at Plexor's forces. \nBut X-Takks have tougher armor and more awesome weapons. \nX-Takk Mazer cuts down Fighters by the dozen, leaving them corrupted or shut down. \nUPPER LEVEL: \nFlynn struggles to help wounded Fighters - He captures a Mazer and uses it against X-Takks... But Flynn can't move well on his bad leg. He watches his troops getting trounced. \nFLYNN Retreat! Over that way!     Move around their flank! \nZAP!   A Mazer blast strikes Flynn's bad leg. \nFLYNN Arrrgghhh! \nMega appears, throws her disk with deadly accuracy. The offending X-Takk Soldier crashes. Millions of bits spray over main arena - fractal fireworks. \n(CONTINUED) \n84   CONTINUED: \nMega grabs Flynn from falling.       They make for a bridge. \nFlynn slaps a wall panel.       Trigger circuit activates, surging down into... \n85   INT.   FIGHTER HIDE-OUT MAIN ARENA \n...Circuit energizes a sector of floor circuits, which overload and BLAZE - frying twenty X-Takks. \n86   INT.   JAIL BLOCK AREA \nRush and Krod use puny PROD LANCES against fearsome X-Takks... \nRush charges an X-Takk dude, Krod gets cornered by another. Rush dodges his death blow, spine-zapping his foe... Krod prepares to die, as X-Takk Bully pins him with a Mazer and squeezes the trigger. \nX-Takk Bully seizes, freezes, crashes. Mazer barrel falls away from Krod - he's lucky to be alive. Rush stows Zap Wand, grabs Mazer and yanks Krod to his feet. \nKROD Thanks. \nRUSH I'll never let you forget it. \nKROD Rush, we're screwed!    Now everybody's after us! \nRUSH Nah, we're cool. We're with them! \nNEGABYTE BEAMS slice walls, erasing all data in their path. Rush, Flynn and Mega dive into a tunnel, escaping by inches. \n90   EXT.   FIGHTER HIDE-OUT / DATA PIPE \nRush, Mega and Flynn, pursued, rendezvous with Krod, Boole and Quantz. \nBOOLE This way!   Down the pipe! \nRush helps Krod, Quantz and Boole into a data pipe.       One by one, they WHIRL away in the flow of chromatic data. \nFlynn and Mega have a breathless moment to consider Rush. \nMEGA He's better than I thought. \nFLYNN He's been sent for a reason. \nMEGA What reason? \nFLYNN Don't know yet. Sometimes we have to trust the bigger plan. \nMega struggles to compute. \nRush turns to help Flynn down the pipe. Mega assists. Flynn's wounded leg gives out, he slips. Rush holds him, but loses his balance, slides down. \nRUSH Mega!   Quick! Jump! \nBut she hesitates - \nVELCRONIC BEAMS snag her from behind - pulling her back onto the ledge. \nRush tumbles down the flume, glancing back to see: \nMega, hauled away by X-Takk Troops. \nRUSH MEGA!!! \n(CONTINUED) \n90   CONTINUED: \nFighters, Krod, Rush and Flynn surf down the data WHIRL, accelerating away from the hot zone. \nX-Takks jump in after them, but are all swallowed by the flow - gone. \n91   INT.   FIGHTER HIDE-OUT / MAIN HALL \nBashed and ruined, littered with fallen Fighters. \nPlexor nurses his injured arm, commanding the mop-up. \nX-Takks bring Mega to their leader. \nX-TAKK 1 We got her! \nMega stands defiant. \nPlexor regards her sternly. Extends his hand to her shoulder, cupping the back of her neck. \nPLEXOR You committed a fatal error. \nDATA ENERGY SURGES from his eyes, flushing her body circuits. She fights intensifying input, but soon weakens. She glitches and shuts down, falling into the arms of X-Takks. \nPLEXOR Their strategies and tactics lie encrypted in her memory. Bring her! I will hack from her what I need. \n92   INT.   DATA PIPE NETWORK \nFlynn leads the way, surfing the chromatic hyper-speed flow with Quantz and Boole. \nRush and Krod struggle to master the technique, rolling, slipping, recovering, grabbing each other. \nRUSH I got it, I got it, I got it. \nBoole surfs around them, heading into a squirrely curve. \nKROD AWWWWWWW! \nKrod swings high, out of control.     Dumps in front of Rush, who flips him upright. \n(CONTINUED) \n92   CONTINUED: \nRUSH Shove it!    Go! \nRush and Krod swerve and gathers speed, shooting past Quantz, Boole and Flynn - pivoting to surf BACKWARDS! \nKROD I remember now! Nothing to it! \nRUSH Check it out! \nRush flips up and surfs on his hands.       Krod attempts to match the move. \nBOOLE Look out! \nRUSH What? \nFLYNN TURN AROUND! \nRush and Krod crane around to see: \nDATA PIPE spills into a massive DATA FLUME. \nRUSH & KROD AHHHHHHHH! \n102   EXT.   X-NET ARTERIES - VARIOUS \nPlexor's Cruiser speeds through a new, as-yet unused X-Net switching station. It's heavily secured. X-Takk troops defer to their supreme leader. \nPlexor veers onto a proprietary side-route, bound for: \n103   EXT.

Data beams react with his circuitry. Encryption key resolves. \nGate opens. \n105   INT.   PROGRAMMING CHAMBER \nPlexor strides across the spare, sleek space. \nOn a slab lies Mega, radiated from above by READER BEAMS. \n105   CONTINUED: \nPlexor considers her glowing body circuits.          Studies emerging data patterns. \nSatisfied, he halts the process.        Beams go dark. \nPLEXOR Boot up. \nMega awakens, sits up.      She sees the device, then Plexor. \nMEGA You treat me like I've been corrupted. \nPLEXOR I cannot predict the random effects Flynn might have caused in you. \nMEGA You programmed me to gather intelligence. That's all I've ever done. \nPLEXOR How long have you known Flynn? \nMEGA Enough time to gain his trust. \nPLEXOR Your behavior was highly authentic. \nMEGA To him.    It had to be. \nPLEXOR Have you allowed Flynn to complete a full interface with you? \nMEGA I am programmed to allow such access only to you, Plexor. \nHer eyes lock on him.      He is satisfied. \nPLEXOR Flynn claims to be a User.     As did the one called Rush. \nMEGA Users do not exist. \nPLEXOR You have seen nothing to make you doubt this? \n105   CONTINUED:    (2) \nMEGA Nothing. \nPLEXOR They possess no powers beyond those of routine Programs? \nMEGA I have no knowledge of such powers. \nShe steps down.     They walk out of the chamber. \nPLEXOR Still, there is something about them I cannot compute. Flynn plans to attack me, doesn't he? \nMEGA Yes. And Rush will fight by his side. \nPLEXOR Where will they strike? \nMEGA Flynn does not decide until the hour of his attack. But he trusts me completely. When he knows the place, I will know it as well. \nPLEXOR Perfect. They will be met with a final thrashing. Yes, let them come. \nThey pass through the gate, arrive in the corridor. \nMEGA Have you further instructions for me? \nPLEXOR None for now. But stay close. \nThey lock gazes.     Barcode data surges between them. \nPLEXOR You came to me full of glitches and random routines. Look at you now. What an extraordinary piece of programming I have made of you. I created X-Net to the same standard of flawless beauty. Soon, its perfection will become all that is, and all that ever will be. \n(CONTINUED) \n105   CONTINUED:    (3) \nMEGA All events remain under your control. \nBingo. \nSquare spins into a circle, latches and LIGHTS the entire Hologon lattice. Intricate 3D code patterns ANIMATES. \nFLYNN Not bad. \nKROD Good thing you didn't terminate us. \nRUSH How do we use this thing to shut down Plexor? \nFLYNN (picks up hologon) It's a copy of Plexor's master key. We can break into any X-Net facility and fry the power supply. \nRUSH But once Plexor knows we have it, he'll change the code. \nFLYNN Yep.   We've got one shot. \nRUSH Then we should take out the power supply to Plexor's main server. \nGROUP Yes! Take out Plexor's central server! \nFLYNN Hang on, guys, that's not as easy as it sounds - \nRUSH I was inside the main server, I saw how it's laid out. \nKROD I used to work there!   I'll recognize where everything is! \nCODE MONK N1J We can take it! \nCODE MONK J2R Hit Plexor where he lives! \n(CONTINUED) \n108   CONTINUED:    (3) \nFLYNN Even with this key, it won't - \nQUANTZ We can pull it off, can't we Flynn? One final assault on Plexor's central server? \nBOOLE Shut him down forever? \nAll eyes on Flynn.    Rush's naivete has ignited false hope in the Fighters. \nRUSH Of course we can. \nFlynn forces a smile. \nFLYNN Hey, the future depends on us.    How could we fail? \n109   INT.   ENCOM ADVANCED RESEARCH LAB - MOMENTS LATER \nSinclair comes off the secured elevator, finds Meg and Dewey at work on Quantum Digitizer. \nMEG It's almost fixed.

I can't go into details. \nMEG But Rush would have no way to return! \nSINCLAIR Meg. I will never hold you responsible. This is a tough call, but it's mine. Dismantle and destroy all of this equipment and software. Immediately. \n109   CONTINUED: \nMEG Well - \nSINCLAIR Meg...

Dark zone, emitting woeful blips of random energy. \nPillars descend from X-Net crews above and SMASH into the old silicon, planting themselves deep and impervious. \nRush stands on a vista point, aghast as X-Net construction dominates the landscape. \nFLYNN It's a bummer being on the losing team, huh Rush? \nFlynn sits nearby, trying to patch his corrupted leg. \nRUSH We'll trash X-Net. Then we'll go back to the our world and expose what Sinclair's done. \nHe looks at Krod, Boole, Quantz and Code Monkeys in the distance, preparing for battle. \nRUSH Do they have any idea our world exists? Do they understand what a User is? \nFLYNN Programs once connected freely with their Users. But Plexor shut down the I/O ports, severing all links. He controls all contact with the world we once knew. Programs operate on his instructions or none at all. \n(CONTINUED) \n110   CONTINUED: \nRUSH Or yours. \nFLYNN It's nothing to brag about.    We're getting our butts kicked. \nRush looks at his arms, astounded. His circuitry strobes in hues of brilliant red. Disk animates and unfolds, revealing infinite surface variations. \nRush feels new power surging inside his body. His eyes harden, keen like Tron's. Rush LEAPS BACKWARD, goes airborne, lands on a ledge high above. Amazing balance. \nKROD & FIGHTERS YES!   Excellent move, dude! \nRUSH It feels...    Awesome. \nRush's voice is a little deeper, with a digital edge.       It surprises him. \nHe cocks his disk and THROWS. \nDisk rockets across the landscape, a mile away and STRIKES an X-NET SURVEY POST, blasting it to bits. Disk arcs high, shoots back toward Rush. \nRush looks worried for a second, ready to duck - \nFLYNN Don't flinch, Rush!   It's your disk now. \nDisk snaps back into Rush's hand, painlessly.       Throbbing with energy. \nRUSH Oh man, this is good. \nRush pulls a new LIGHT WAND from a thigh bracket. It extends into a hundred-foot vaulting pole. Rush VAULTS across the canyon, lands with precision. Light pole retracts into the wand in a nanosecond. \nKROD Awwwww!   Where can I get one of those? \nAnother two vaults and a leap - Rush tosses his disk into a spiral, steps off it mid-air (like stairs), and lands perfectly - rejoining the group. \nCheers from Krod, Quantz, Boole and Code Monkeys.

He freezes in place. \nPLEXOR Attack! \nCybavor leaps like a hyena, bounds the length of the hall. DIVES at the Worker Drone... \nAnd DEVOURS HIM mercilessly. \nEnergy sparks fly, circuits zap, as the Cybavor digest the energy, GROWS LARGER, then SPLITS DOWN THE MIDDLE (like DNA), then regrows the missing halves. \nNow the Cybavor is a PAIR of nasty, snarling Cybavors. \nPLEXOR End routine. \nCybavors sit. \nPLEXOR Elegant. \nSurveying his perfect defenses, he notices one thing missing. \nPatrols of X-Takks pass. \nRush leaps to a vantage point them. Scouts a route, signals Flynn, Krod, Boole, Quantz and the Code Monkeys. \nFighter team scales a narrow ledge near the BLAZING FIREWALL. It's like a sheet of molten lead, pouring endlessly before them. A lethal barrier. \nFLYNN This is all yours, Rush. \nRush pulls his disk, holds it over his head and steps under the molten data flow. He struggles against raw power, disk HEATS UP WHITE, splashing aside the molten data. \nFLYNN Go!

I'll stay here and run interference. \nRUSH You haven't got a chance by yourself. \nFLYNN Ah, these guys are wimps. \nIt's bravado: They know his odds are dismal. Flynn slumps into an alcove, which is only big enough for him. He pulls a supply of SPIKED MINI-DISKS, ready to defend himself. \nMEGA We're not leaving you. \nFLYNN My body is weak, but my will is strong.

Energy zaps off his body, infusing the surrounding circuitry. \nTron stares, unblinking - Cyber-Ninja. \nRUSH It's YOU!    The intruder! \nRush's body circuits PULSE with anger - data surges out his feet, across floor circuitry, up to the plateau. Energy interacts with Tron's body circuits, siphoning off bits of code. \nCode races across Rush's eyes.        Identification data. \nRUSH You are...    TRON?!? \nX-Takks hustle onto the scene. \nTron leaps off the plateau, cutting the data connection.

We're on the same side here. I got an ID on the intruder! \nMega touches Rush, exciting his energy flow.

Accesses archive files of the original low-rez Tron: So harmless, so many years ago. Bears little resemblance to the upgraded Tron. \nPLEXOR You are in error. Zero match. \nRUSH Exactly. That's how he's getting past you. You don't see him for what he is. He's one of your own, gone bad. Tron was a crude security program from Encom's old days. Strictly low-rez, right? Archived and forgotten. But his source code contains all the architecture of every Encom system, including X-net.

But I can find Tron for you. \nPlexor processes.     His eyes stream barcode data to X-Takks: \nPLEXOR Release him. \nX-Takk Troops read Plexor's barcode command with their eyes. \nThey let go of Rush. \nPlexor turns to Mega.       Issues more barcode. \nPLEXOR Interface with this one. Exploit his ability. Locate the program \"Tron\" and destroy him on sight. \nMEGA Instructions received, Plexor. \nMega exits with Rush.

You ran a trace on a hotshot lightcycle rider. The red guy. Remember? \nKROD Well. Eh. I'd like to help you, but truth is, I just got rebooted from a big crash. There's nothing left in my memory from before. \nHe taps his head. \nMEGA This will yield zero. \nRUSH Hang on. \nRush thinks, touches a surface. Concentrates.

You're coming with us to the old game grid. We're going to find Tron and shut him down. \nKROD Beats working. \nThey head out.      Krod falls in beside Mega, impressed by her. \nKROD Hey babe.

These ports were for simulation only. \nRUSH Right... But how did those poor misguided fools boot up the link? \nMEGA They stood in the center.

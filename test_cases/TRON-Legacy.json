It's time to think without a box! \nMinds ponder grimly. Finally, a lone VP rises.      It's RUDY, the company Archivist. \nRUDY At a time like this, let's seek inspiration in the past. We should ask ourselves: What solution would spring from the inspired mind of our departed leader, Flynn. \n(CONTINUED) \n23   CONTINUED:    (3) \nHe's got an obituary photo of FLYNN, Encom's legendary previous - and deceased - CEO. \nGroans around the table. Execs rolls their eyes, disses Rudy's idea. Flynn has become a stale company joke. \nRudy sheepishly sits. \nBut Sinclair stops behind Rudy, eyes fixed on the photo of Flynn. An idea takes hold. He looks to Meg. \nSINCLAIR Is the QF-401 is operational? \nMEG Um...   Midway into phase one testing. \nConfusion among execs.     Nobody knows what a \"QF-401\" is. Not even Rush. \nSINCLAIR If we can't fight this intruder from the outside, then maybe we need to fight him from the inside. \nMeg's mind races. \nMEG I'm ready to do my part. \nSINCLAIR This company needs a hero. Who among you is the smartest, most resourceful and courageous? \nLooks trade around the table.     Meg slowly rises, indicating her choice. \nMEG Who else could it be? \nShe's singled out Rush. \n24   INT.   ENCOM CORP CORRIDOR - SECURE ELEVATOR - DAY \nMeg leads Sinclair and Rush to a SECURE ELEVATOR.     Her retinal scan ID opens the door. They step in. \n25   INT.   ENCOM SECURE ELEVATOR - GOING DOWN - MOMENTS LATER \nRUSH Somebody going to tell me what I've been volunteered for? \n(CONTINUED) \n25   CONTINUED: \nSINCLAIR Rush, you're the only one I can trust to eliminate the intruder. But you won't be doing it the way you thought. Meg's been working on something down here that's, well... Beyond Top Secret. \nRush drills a look at Meg, but she keeps it all business. \n26   INT.   ENCOM ADVANCED RESEARCH LAB - MOMENTS LATER \nOut the elevator, Meg leads them into a maze of ultra-tech gear. \nMEG This is where Flynn worked.   And where he died. \nAmid sleek new equipment, there's a glass cabinet housing a CHARRED REMNANT of strange machinery. \nSINCLAIR Meg has reconstructed Flynn's last project. This time it works. \nMega signals lab assistant DEWEY. He pokes buttons:       A MASSIVE TECHNICAL DEVICE unfolds and boots up. \nRUSH You didn't pick this up at Circuit City. What is it? \nMEG A Quantum Digitizer. Prototype, only one of its kind. Flynn designed it to break down physical objects into high resolution data. Luckily, we salvaged his key components and back-engineered the system. \nShe opens a cage, places her LAB RAT (Jo-Jo) on a target stage. Dewey boots controls, presses commands. Beam array scans the rat into the computer, forming a 3D rat-image on screens, dematerializing the physical rat. Device revs down. \nRush runs his hand over the empty target stage. \nRUSH That's...   Not possible. \nLab rat has vanished from the physical world.     Its digitized image rotates on monitors. \n(CONTINUED) \n26   CONTINUED: \nMEG Flynn was trying to take it one step further. He wanted to transport a human being into cyberspace. \nRUSH You mean the urban legends? A computer sucked Flynn into cyberspace a long time ago. \nSINCLAIR We think it happened. \nMeg agrees.    Rush gets a chill. \nSINCLAIR It was a fluke. But Flynn worked for years, down here, trying to make it happen again. One day a test went bad. A plasma reaction destroyed this lab. Flynn was reduced to ash. \nRush views the charred remains in the glass case. Photos of the destroyed lab. Spooky evidence of a hellish death scene. \nRUSH I was never told how he died. It was all just weird, you know, because Flynn's the guy who hired me. But he was strange, kept to himself, I didn't know what job I was supposed to be doing. (to Sinclair) Then you came onboard, the company woke up, we had a direction. It was kind of pathetic, because by the time Flynn died, everybody was too busy to care. \nSINCLAIR He was brilliant in his way, but genius without discipline leads to nothing. His reckless habits nearly ruined this company... And for sure got him killed. \nA last look at the charred remains of Flynn's machine. \nMEG That kind of accident can't happen again. We've upgraded the system in ways Flynn never could. The chips didn't exist until now. \n(CONTINUED) \n", "test1_true": "She presses commands. Beams re-materialize the lab rat on the target stage. Jo-jo is as good as new. \nMEG Hey, Jo-Jo.    Have good trip? \nShe puts the rat in on her shoulder, feeds it a tidbit. Then she scrutinizes Rush. \nRush considers Meg, then turns to Sinclair. \nRUSH You want her to send me into cyberspace to catch that jerk who hacked us? \nSINCLAIR The future of this company depends on it. \nRush looks to Meg.    She offers a reassuring nod. \nRUSH You can bring me back okay? \nMEG Ask Jo-Jo. \nLab rat is perched happily on her shoulder. \nSINCLAIR Destroy the intruder by 9AM tomorrow, Rush. I know if anyone can, it's you. I've had my eye on you for a long time. Score this hit and I'll make you my full partner in this company. \nRush is awe-struck. Ready, willing, able.        He shakes Sinclair's hand, sealing the deal. \nRUSH I won't let you down.   Let's do it. \nMeg removes target stage, swings a custom TARGET CHAIR in place. Rush lowers in place. Meg buckles him in. Last chance for a private word: \nMEG I promise I'll get you back safely by 9AM tomorrow. But you have to promise me something too - \n(CONTINUED) \n26   CONTINUED:    (3) \nRUSH You're a piece of work. You dumped me because you said I was too much about the company's needs and not enough about yours. Well here we are, the company needs their best guy, and you just can't admit how much to hurts to nominate me. \nMEG This bigger than us, Rush. Listen to me. I don't know what you're going to find in there, but whatever it is, promise you'll follow your heart and do the right thing. \nRush stares at here, in shock. \nRUSH Oh.    So you think I have a heart? \nMeg breaks away, retreating to the controls with Sinclair. Rush's trails her with his eyes - he can't stop looking. \nRUSH (under his breath) I promise. \nMeg initiates Quantum Digitizer sequence. \nRush watches PULSING CHROMATIC LIGHT build down the unit's column, coming toward him. \nPlasma strobes CYAN/MAGENTA. Unit HUMS... Then GROANS WILDLY. Flashes randomize. Something's off balance - \nMeg worries.       Moves for the \"abort\" button. \nDEWEY It's overloading! \nUnit sparks.       Ceramic components STRESS and CRACK. \nRush clenches his seat, terrified. \nRUSH What's happening?! \nMEG System is losing stability! \nSinclair sees: Monitor sounds company-wide alert:         \"X-NET BREECH! INTRUDER DETECTED!\" \n(CONTINUED) \n26   CONTINUED:    (4) \nSINCLAIR There's been another breech! \nRUSH It's the Intruder again! \nMEG We have to abort! \nSINCLAIR We might not get another chance! \nRUSH DO IT! \nSinclair pulls Meg's hand from the \"abort\" button and slams his hand on \"DIGITIZE\". \nBEAM ARRAY scans Rush's body, reducing it to bits - \nMeg worries - \nSinclair dives for cover - \nPLASMA BALL engulfs Quantum Digitizer. \nFINAL BITS of Rush scan away. \nPlasma ball FRIES the unit.

Wide, secure, newly constructed. High above the tangle of chaotic, clogged OLD DATA ARTERIES. \nRUSH X-Net is amazing. It's going to change everything.

X-NET SWITCHING NEXUS/HUB CITY \nConstruction nearly complete.       High security. \nMega leads Rush to secured encryption gates.         Her eyes light with data, the gate opens. \nMEGA The program \"KROD\" is over there. \nAcross a bridge: An old-network HUB CITY. Like Hong Kong in wilder days. Jammed with Programs, colorful data, loud data transfer screams. \nRUSH What a dump. \nHe heads across, but Mega hesitates. \nRUSH Hey.    Interface. \nMega grudgingly follows.

You will travel in total security! \nCrowd buzzes.       They can't wait. \nMEGA This is the one you seek? \nRush approaches Krod. Looks like Miles Rabbish.           There's a bizarre moment of recognition between them. \n34   CONTINUED: \nRUSH It's gotta be - \nKROD Krod! \nRUSH Krod! \nKROD Yeah, yeah -     Heeey! \nRUSH The best pattern recognition program ever. (to Mega) This guy can filter a river of junk data and pull out the good stuff. \nKROD You know it, dude! \nKrod smiles big at Mega, refers to Rush: \nKROD Who is this guy? \nRush pulls Krod aside. \nRUSH Miles - I mean Krod, you flew the search engine. You ran a trace on a hotshot lightcycle rider. The red guy. Remember? \nKROD Well. Eh. I'd like to help you, but truth is, I just got rebooted from a big crash. There's nothing left in my memory from before. \nHe taps his head. \nMEGA This will yield zero. \nRUSH Hang on. \nRush thinks, touches a surface. Concentrates. Circuitry zaps from data coming off his hands. Connections illuminate, data races around walls and floors. \nPrograms stop what they're doing, amazed by the feat. \n(CONTINUED) \n34   CONTINUED:    (2) \nMega is astonished - and privately worried. \nRush's data flow illuminates surfaces with images from HIS memory - the opening light cycle race. \nRUSH Remember, Krod?

And the green guy splattered big time! It was awesome! How could I forget that?! \nSplat happens in Rush's memory image.        All goes white. \nRUSH Where did the red guy go after that? You didn't crash right away. \nKROD He escaped out this hidden exit - \nKrod's points to another screen.        \"Wanted\" image of Tron. \nKROD THAT GUY!   The RED GUY! \nRUSH Did you jack his coordinate? \nKROD Tr165444.018! \nThey slap high fives.     Krod double-takes on Rush. \nKROD And the green guy was YOU! You got rebooted?!

You're coming with us to the old game grid. We're going to find Tron and shut him down. \nKROD Beats working. \nThey head out.      Krod falls in beside Mega, impressed by her. \nKROD Hey babe.

ANCIENT COMPUTER SYSTEM I/O PORT \nRush, Krod and Mega head deep into an obsolete, abandoned region of low-rez circuitry. \nKROD The old game grid is this way - \nHe spins. Rush and Mega aren't behind him. They've climbed inside a defunct I/O Port: Like a retro-tech temple. \nRUSH How do I uplink to the real world? \nMEGA The real world doesn't exist. Nobody can uplink. These ports were for simulation only. \nRUSH Right... But how did those poor misguided fools boot up the link? \nMEGA They stood in the center.

That's all I've ever done. \nPLEXOR How long have you known Flynn? \nMEGA Enough time to gain his trust. \nPLEXOR Your behavior was highly authentic. \nMEGA To him.    It had to be. \nPLEXOR Have you allowed Flynn to complete a full interface with you? \nMEGA I am programmed to allow such access only to you, Plexor. \nHer eyes lock on him.

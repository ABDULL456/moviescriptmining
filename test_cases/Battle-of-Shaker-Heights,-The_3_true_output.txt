TABBY Yeah. 
KELLY Honestly? I didn't think you two were right for each other. 
TABBY You did, huh? 
Kelly walks over to her painting. 
KELLY Like this painting. Stare at it too long and you can't see it anymore. But if someone else sees it for the first time, they can tell exactly what it is. 
TABBY I don't need any more bullshit right now. 
Kelly stops, taken aback. He walks away from the painting. 
KELLY He could never understand you. 
TABBY I'm not as complicated as you think. 
Kelly walks to the window and looks out. 
KELLY I never said you were complicated. 
Tabby laughs/cries at this. 
TABBY Oh. 
KELLY He just wasn't the right one. 
Tabby nods. She's starting to calm down a little. 
TABBY There's more to it than that. 
Tabby looks at her shredded tissue. Kelly sits down on the couch next to her. 
KELLY I'm really sorry. I really am. 
TABBY Thanks. 
Kelly pats her knee awkwardly. 
KELLY Don't cry. 
Tabby turns her face to Kelly's. 
TABBY You like me, don't you? 
KELLY Of course. 
Tabby closes her eyes. 
TABBY No, I mean -- you like me. 
Kelly looks scared. He wants to retreat. But he calms himself down. 
KELLY Yeah. I think you're amazing. 
TABBY Well, do something. 
Long pause. Then -- Kelly kisses her. She kisses back and they fall against the couch together. 
EXT. BOWLAND HOUSE - NIGHT 
BART (O.S.) All right, all right. I'm going. 
Bart comes out in his pajamas to turn off the sprinkler. He looks up and freezes. 
Kelly comes out of Tabby's studio. He shuts the door carefully and walks around the pool. 
Kelly doesn't see Bart. 
Bart doesn't say anything. He just watches Kelly go. 
INT. ERNSWILER HOUSE - DAY 
Kelly throws parts of his soldier's kit onto his bed from corners of the room. The canteen underhand. The Jeep cap as a free throw. This is the best day of his life. 
Until he finds his uniform crumpled up behind the door, still crusted with mud. 
KELLY Damn it. Damn it. 
He flops on his bed. But he can't help it. Soon he's smiling again. He gets up, gathers up the uniform, and tears out of the room. 
INT. KITCHEN 
Kelly comes down the stairs two at a time, singing. 
Eve and Abe watch surprised from the table. Abe looks pale. 
KELLY What?

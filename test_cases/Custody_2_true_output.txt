Kids and toys are strewn across the floor. Rick wears a heavy shade of facial growth. He reads The Genealogy of Morals. The Jailer stands at the cell door. 
JAILER Get yourself cleaned up. 
RICK Huh? 
JAILER You have visitors... in the courtyard. 
EXT. SUMMIT COUNTY JAIL - COURTYARD - DAY Shaved and wearing sunglasses, Rick approaches his parents. He reaches his FATHER, (60's), first. 
FATHER Quite the pickle you've got yourself in. 
RICK So it seems. 
Rick's MOTHER gives him a big hug. 
MOTHER She was no good for you. I knew it from the start. 
RICK Mom, don't... okay? 
MOTHER Just saying... 
RICK I know, but what's done is done. 
The children notice their grandparents and run to greet them. They tackle their grandfather's legs. FATHER There's my boys. 
BOYS IN UNISON 
Grandpa. Rick and his mother sit at a picnic table while the boys play with their grandfather. 
MOTHER You're dad and I are here for you. 
RICK I know mom. 
MOTHER Are you eating? 
RICK Yeah, I guess. 
MOTHER Do you need anything? Food? Money? RICK Watch the kids one night? I could use some time to myself. 
MOTHER Um... Yeah... okay... I suppose that would be all right... we'd have to ask your father, but I don't see why that would be a problem. (a beat) Other than that everything's okay? 
RICK We're okay... 
MOTHER Because it doesn't have to be like this. Mary Ryan, a friend of mine, her son had the same thing happen to him. Wife just up and left with no warning at all. He didn't waste a day. No sir, he was up and at `em almost instantly. You can leave here, you know? Mary Ryan's son did. 
RICK I like it here, mom. MOTHER What's to like? It's dingy and filthy. It's no place to raise children. 
RICK It's home and it's stable. The one thing the boys need right now is stability. 
MOTHER You can't keep hiding forever. 
RICK It's been five days, mom. I'm not hiding. I just need time to adjust. 
MOTHER Mary Ryan's son thinks you're hiding. RICK Do I know this guy? 
Rick's mother slides a business card across the picnic table. 
MOTHER No, but I think you should. I hate that woman. How can a mother abandon her kids? How could she do this to my babies? 
Rick looks to a blue sky. 
DISSOLVE TO:

CINDY Scott? Scott? 
SCOTT (Catching up) Yeah baby?

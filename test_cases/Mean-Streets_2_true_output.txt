CHARLIE You threaten me with my uncle? After what I'm doing for you? 
JOHNNY BOY What you're doing for me isn't worth it...believe me! 
CHARLIE slaps JOHNNY BOY and pushes him against the door again. 
CHARLIE Then don't show up tonight and see what happens. 
CHARLIE stops. He digs his hands into JOHNNY'S pockets but he can't find anything. 
CHARLIE How much have you got for Michael tonight? 
JOHNNY BOY I only got eight bucks on me. 
CHARLIE stares at JOHNNY BOY for a moment then puts his hand into his own pocket and pulls out three ten dollar bills and three ones. 
CHARLIE Here, take twenty bucks. With your eight that makes twenty-eight bucks you give Michael. I keep the thirteen for the weekend. Maybe we'll eat some Chinese food later. 
JOHNNY BOY doesn't take it. CHARLIE forces it into his hand. 
CHARLIE Take it. I'm doing it for you, stupid! 
JOHNNY BOY No you're not... 
CHARLIE, calmer now, is feeling ashamed. 
CHARLIE Oh, cut it out, will ya? 
JOHNNY BOY Charlie, twenty-eight bucks is nothing. The only way to do it is through your uncle...think about it will you? 
CHARLIE NO!!! What do you think I am, crazy??? 
JOHNNY BOY No, I just want to help myself, that's all. 
CHARLIE Come on. 
He tugs JOHNNY BOY along. 
CUT TO: 
INT. TONY'S PLACE - BAR 
TONY You're over an hour late. Michael said he'll be back later, though... 
CHARLIE takes a drink. JOHNNY BOY sits at the bar. The place is beginning to empty and the show is over. CHARLIE takes TONY aside. 
CHARLIE Watch this kid for me. I have to go someplace but I'll be back soon to get Michael and him together. Don't even let him go to the bathroom. 
He turns to JOHNNY BOY. 
CHARLIE Don't you move!!! 
JOHNNY BOY (SULKING) I'll be here. Don't worry. 
JOHNNY orders a drink. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CAB - NIGHT - BLACK AND WHITE 
CHARLIE gets into the cab. 
CHARLIE 6th Avenue and Waverly Place, fast please. 
The cab takes off. They soon arrive at their destination. 
CAB DRIVER Where do you want me to stop?

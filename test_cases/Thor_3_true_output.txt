5 INT. SUV 5 
Jane grins, thrilled, pumped with adrenaline. 
JANE Isn't this great?! A thought strikes her. 
JANE (CONT'D) You're seeing it too, right? I'm not crazy? 
SELVIG That's debateable. Put your seat belt on! 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 3A. The SUV lurches. 
6 EXT. DESERT 6 
Winds HOWL around the SUV now. Up ahead, spiraling down from out of the clouds comes -- 
AN ENORMOUS TORNADO Suffuse with the strange rainbow light, ROARING like a thousand freight trains as it touches down. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 4. 
7 INT. SUV 7 
Selvig looks up through the still-open sunroof at the enormous glowing funnel cloud with wonder. Jane clambers into the front seat, beside Darcy. She leans way out the window, TAPING the storm. 
JANE You've gotta get us closer so I can take a magnetic reading. Darcy laughs. 
DARCY Yeah, right! Good one! (then, realizing) Oh God, you're serious... 
JANE You want those college credits or not? 
8 EXT. SUV 8 
The SUV tears across a field towards the tornado, Jane leaning out the window, taping the event. The SUV disturbs two RAVENS perched on a cactus as they race past. The birds take flight, when -- KRAKABOOM! A huge BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes down through the center of the funnel cloud before them with a terrifying intensity. 
9 INT. SUV 9 
The SUV rocks from the blast. Darcy's had enough. She turns the wheel, starts to head away. 
DARCY Keep the credits. I'll intern at Burger King. 
JANE What are you doing?! 
DARCY Saving our lives! Jane grabs the wheel, jerks it hard the other way. They struggle for control, when the headlights fall on -- 
A MAN 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 5. Directly in their path, stumbling through the winds. Darcy slams on the brakes, Jane turns the wheel hard to avoid him. The SUV swerves -- but too late. 
10 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) 10 
The side of the SUV slams into the man with a THUD, sending him flying. The car SKIDS to a stop. 
11 INT. SUV 11 
Jane, Darcy, and Selvig trade shocked looks, breathing hard. They peer through the dust clouds, unable to see through. A paralyzed moment, then they all leap out of the car. 
12 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) 12 
The three race from the SUV with flashlights. Jane spots the man lying on the ground. He's dressed in tattered clothing, charred and blackened. 
DARCY I think that was legally your fault. 
JANE Get the first aid kit. Darcy heads back inside the SUV as Jane, concerned, kneels next to the man. Selvig hovers, protectively. She gently turns his head to the light, and we see him clearly for the first time. He is magnificently handsome, long blonde hair flowing around his classically sculpted features. She cups her hands around his face, as if willing the life back into him. 
JANE (CONT'D) Come on, big guy. Do me a favor and don't be dead, okay? Open your eyes and look at me. Suddenly, he GROANS, and she's startled, then relieved, as his eyes flutter open. She looks deep into his confused, azure eyes, which at last focus on her own. Locking onto them. For a moment, they each forget to breathe. The connection is broken as Darcy returns with the kit. She freezes when she sees how gorgeous the man is. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 5A. 
DARCY Wow. Does he need CPR? Because I know CPR. A flustered Jane smooths her hair and sits back on her heels. She looks up at Selvig. Back to being a scientist. 
JANE 
HIS EYES-- 
DARCY 
(DREAMILY) --are beautiful. 
JANE --are dilating. That's a good sign. 
SELVIG We still have to get him to a hospital. 
JANE 
(HOPEFULLY) After we get a reading on the storm?

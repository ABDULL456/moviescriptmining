{"test1_input": "The large, raw-boned FERRYMAN holds open the wooden stile for the one and only passenger from the island \u00ad Clara -- to disembark. Clara passes them , giving first Skip and then the others a look, shaking her head in sad appraisal. FERRYMAN (cont.) (GROWLS) Ok, let's go. \nIt's not the friendliest greeting in the world. The ferryman keeps the stile open for them to board singly. There is also a younger assistant on board -- BUCK, a pleasant, openfaced townie in his 20s. \nFERRYMAN (cont.) To the rear. Outa the operator's way. \nNikki clutches at Skip's arm. \nNIKKI (IN MOCK-TERROR) This is it? No going back? Trapped for days on an island where men are men, and women oughta know better? \nARCH (BEHIND HER) Try to control yourself, Sister O'Toole. \nNIKKI (SUGGESTIVE ) You could tie me in chains... \nChaz boards, passing Buck, the assistant. \nCHAZ (a low whisper) Your fly's open, and your Hostess Twinkie's hanging out... \nThe assistant gapes, falling for it, groping his fly. Which is closed, of course. He looks up, grinning. Chaz kisses him on the cheek, winks and moves on. \nBUCK Sh -i-i-t... \nKit is hanging back on the dock. \nFERRYMAN Come on if you're coming. \nKIT (URGENTLY) Excuse me. But we're still waiting for somebody -- \nFERRYMAN (GRUFFLY) It's Friday. My last run of the week. I don't get paid overtime. KIT But you've got to wait. They said it's the only way over. If he misses this... \nArch WHISTLES loudly, seeing and alerting them. \nPARKING LOT - THEIR POV A late model Detroit sedan (the one we saw earlier turning off the highway) pulls to a fast stop in the lot. Rob hurries out; a CHEER comes up from the group on the ferry. Kit closes her eyes in relief. Rob comes hurrying up the ramp. \nANGLE \u00ad LANDING ...followed closely by HARVEY 'HAL' EDISON, JR. \nHARVEY Wait up! \nHarvey is the driver of the sedan, and after he carefully locks up, he comes running with his bag, too. He is a rangy, straight-arrow Ivy League farmboy from the Border South, and he's the last of Muffy's invited guests. He also, somewhat incongruously, sports a Bruce Springsteen badge. \nROB (to Kit, kissing her) Sorry... Nik, Chaz... (to Skip and Nan whom he doesn't know) Rob Ferris... \nThey return greetings. \nHARVEY (RIGHT BEHIND ) Hi! Harvey 'Hal' Edison, Jr., but please call me Hal. Only my folks call me Harve... and I can't stand it. Boy, this sure is a pretty spot. \nStylistically, he's a Martian. Chaz stares at him. \nCHAZ You're friends with... Muffy St. John? \nHARVEY (PROUDLY) Sure am. We sit together in Econ 345. I let her copy my marginal utility curves. \nNIKKI I get it. That's a joke. Preppy Skip adds his greeting. \nSKIP (an ironical nod) Harve. \nHARVEY (correcting him, blithely) Hal... (noticing interest his badge) Springsteen, he's still the Boss! \nFERRYMAN (IMPATIENTLY) Ok, c'mon, I don't have all day. \nHe slams the stile down after Harvey, the last to board, and gets busy with the stubborn motor. His assistant helps. Chaz tapes. \nHARVEY (enthusiastically, putting down his fear) YOU all buddies? \nNIKKI Except for Skip and Nan. Them we just met. \nKIT (AMIABLY) But we will be. \nCHAZ (MEANING SKIP) Watch what you say around him, though. He's Muffy's cousin. \nHARVEY (tickled, to Skip) No kiddin'? \nSKIP Distant. Over the horizon. Otherwise, I wouldn't be invited... (frowns, tellingly) Old money never mixes family with friends. \nNIKKI This is true. For as long as I've known her. \nKIT (JOKING) To protect her family, I guess. SKIP (UNSMILING) To keep her friends. \nHe turns to Arch, holds up his hand, and CLICK, a switchblade opens into the lens. \n", "test1_true": "ARCH (nervously, a laugh) Hey, what's this...? \nSKIP You up for a game of stretch? \nCHAZ (still taping, to Skip) Your fly's open. \nSKIP Eat it. \nCHAZ (undaunted, to Rob) Your fly's open. (SHRUGS) Ok, so don't believe me. \nHe keeps the tape rolling. Rob discreetly looks down. His fly is open. Kit looks at him dubiously. Rob zips. Chaz beams, getting it all for posterity. The engine finally engages. The ferry lurches. \nROB (smiles weakly to Kit) We're off! \nThey are indeed. \nEXT. THE SOUND - DISTANT POV - DAY \nThe ferry pulls away from the mainland. \nEXT. THE FERRY - DAY \nA CLOSER ANGLE. The sturdy, barge like ship craft makes progress. The Ferryman and Buck remain at the stern. \nECU - THE DECK \nAs Skip's knife flies INTO FRAME, it bites into the boards and holds. SKIP AND ARCH \nat their game. Arch stretches, can't reach the knife, and topples over. \nSkip hoots triumphantly. \nSKIP First round, the champ! \nNIKKI AND HARVEY \nNikki, much to her chagrin, finds herself the object of Harvey's attentions. \nHARVEY Y'know what I find amazin'? Muffy's her real name. I mean, I'm Harvey, but they call me Hal, so I thought, 'Muffy', it must stand for something... Muffin? \nNIKKI Muffers, Moffo, Muff-child , Muffin' stuff, the Muffster... \nHARVEY (GRINS) I bet you're her oldest friend. \nNIKKI (BORED) Actually, she's three months older than I am. \nHARVEY You know what I mean. \nNIKKI Harvey... are you planning a career in politics when you grow up? \nHARVEY I've given it some thought. Why? \nNIKKI Oh, just a hunch. \nHARVEY First, though, I'm hopin' to interview with her daddy's company, Southern Regional Sales, next year before graduation... Y'know, he's worth more'n 50 mill over the counter! \nShe just stares at him. CLOSE UP - THE KNIFE \ndigging into the deck again. \nARCH (O.S.) Jesus... \nARCH and SKIP \nThe knife is at an impossible distance. \nSKIP (LAUGHING) Go for it, big fella. \nArch swallows his pride and makes a hopeless attempt. \nCHAZ fastens onto Nan, immersed in one of her books. He carries his own. \nCHAZ (sitting beside her) Whatcha readin'? \nNAN Milton. Paradise Lost. For Professor Russo's course on the English epic... It's a shame. It's a dying form. Not too many people read it nowadays, even in college. What's yours? \nCHAZ (SHOWS HER) Suck and fuck. \n", "test1_id": 2091, "test2_input": "Rob steps forward and lifts the painting off the wall. Behind it is an inset bookcase. Sitting on one of the shelves, at the proper height to have lined up with the holes in the portrait, is a child's Felix-the- cat nursery clock. The eyes of the plastic cat move back and forth, like a pendulum marking seconds. \nINT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT \nRob sets the painting on the floor outside their bedroom door, leaning it up against the wall. \nCAMERA DOLLIES IN for a CLOSE UP of the portrait. It looks much creepier with the now vacant eye sockets. \nINT. ROB AND KIT'S ROOM - NIGHT \nThey are undressing on opposite sides of the bed. The silence between them is thick enough to be cut with a knife. Kit sits down slowly on the edge of the bed and quietly slips under the covers. Rob gets in on his side. \nThey sit in silence for a moment, making no move to join each other in the middle of the bed. \nKIT Rob? \nNo answer. \nKIT You still angry with me? About dinner? \nROB No. I'm sorry. I'm not angry with you. I'm just angry. \nHe leans over, turns off the bedside lamp... and the light in the bathroom comes on. Beat. \nHe gets out of bed and crosses to the bathroom, reaches in and turns off the light... ...and the overhead light comes on. Kit starts to laugh and quickly covers her mouth. Rob walks to the door, turns off the overhead light... \n...and the bedside lamp comes on again. Kit laughs harder, but still tries to stifle it. \nRob shoots her a look, then goes and sits on the edge of the bed. He reaches to turn off the bedside lamp again, then thinks better of it and starts to unscrew the bulb instead. \nROB (burning his fingers) Ouch! Jesus! \nKit can't stop herself any longer. She laughs out loud. Rob perseveres, finally unscrewing the bulb enough to plunge the room into darkness. \nSilence. \nROB Very funny. \nKit breaks up laughing again. To her it is funny. And soon Rob is laughing too. He swings his legs up under the covers beside her. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nMuffy turns off the last of the lights downstairs, leaving the porch light on for Skip. \nINT. UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT \nMuffy moves through the quiet to her room. Arch grabs her. She jumps. \nMUFFY (COLLECTS HERSELF) Arch do you know what time it is? \nARCH Um-hmm. \nMUFFY (turning down his collar) Goodnight, Arch. \nGently but firmly, she extricates herself, closing the bedroom door behind her. ARCH \nUndaunted, he scuttles down the hall to Rob and Kit's closed door to listen in. He frowns, the slides farther down to Nikki's room, knocks once softly, and enters. \nHIS POV \nNikki is already occupied, however, with Chaz. She catches Arch's stare, signalling him to get the hell out. \nREVERSE \nArch valorously steps back, closing the door and returning to try Nan. \nThe light underneath her door flicks off, however. The door is also locked. \nArch curses, returning to his large but empty room. He slams the door for everybody's benefit. \nINT. MUFFY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nMuffy, undressing, hears, and smiles. \nINT. ARCH'S ROOM - NIGHT Arch is pacing the bedroom, horny and alone. He gets an idea, goes and rummages through Chaz' stuff and comes up with a video cassette of a porno movie. \nCarrying -the cassette he crosses to the door and turns the handle. The doorknob comes off in his hand. \nHe throws it down in disgust, goes and sits in a chair and broods. The chair collapses beneath him. \n", "test2_true": "Skip makes his way boldly, carelessly, drunkenly along. Overgrown weeds and tall spring grass choke the path, shadowing his way. He takes one last drink, killing the bottle, and hurls it out into the night. \nAfter a long pause there is the distant sound O.S. of the bottle landing in water with a splash. \nEXT. OLD , BOATHOUSE - NIGHT \nSkip emerges from the overgrowth. The abandoned old structure and its dock squat ahead at water's edge. Beneath the boathouse, floating in the water, is a grungy old skiff covered by a tarp. Skip turns away from the dock, and flicks his lighter among the weeds, finding marijuana growing there. He CACKLES with triumph. \nSomething MOVES nearby. He doesn't pay attention, taking out his knife to cull the dried leaves. He cups them in his hand against the wind, douses his lighter, and hurries out onto the dock to the boathouse entrance to prepare his joint. \nINT. BOATHOUSE - NIGHT \nas Skip enters. It is pitch black in here, and aside from the gentle lapping sounds of water against the pilings down below O.S., all is still. \nSkip flips a lightswitch in the darkness and nothing happens. He edges slowly along a wall away from the door. Then he becomes aware of another living presence in the boathouse. It is a slow breathing sound--completely inhuman. \nSKIP Hello? \nThere is no answer, but the breathing continues. Then a sharp rapping sound very near, like a foot striking the wood flooring. \nSKIP Who's there? \nPause. No answer. We hear in the darkness the sound of his switchblade clicking open. And then he waits, straining his ears to hear. \nFinally, Skip reaches into his pocket, puils out his lighter and flicks it on. \nSomething snags him from behind. \nSkip gasps, helpless, as a thick rope controlled by powerful, shadowed hands tightens around his neck. \nHis knife, dried leaves and lighter cascade to the floor. \nEXT. ST. JOHN HOUSE - NIGHT - LATER \nOnly the porch light remains glowing. The house is dark. \nINT. ROB AND KIT'S ROOM - NIGHT \nRob wakes, hearing the CRY from Muff's room. Kit, naked against him, wakes too. They hear the muffled cry again. It is not from lovemaking. Rob throws off the covers. INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT \nRob wraps himself with a towel, stepping quickly out to Muffy's door. Everything else is dark and quiet. \nROB (hushed, at door) Muffy? \nNo answer. He tries her door, but it's locked tight. \nA beat. Then: \nROB (cont.) (CONCERNED) Muffy? \nMUFFY'S VOICE (UNCERTAINLY) Yes? \nROB You OK? \nMUFFY'S VOICE (DISTANTLY) Yes... Thank you... \nHe pulls back from the door. \nROB (reluctantly, puzzled) OK... well, goodnight... \nNo response. He turns back for his room, catching sight of Chaz, who has come out of Nikki's room, to investigate, too. \nEXT. HOUSE - MORNING \nHarvey is out on the second floor balcony exercising vigorously. No one else is in evidence until a bedroom window flies open and Nikki, naked from the waist up and believing herself unwatched, leans out and stretches, breathing in the sweet morning air. \nThen she sees Harvey grinning at her. She quickly covers herself and pulls back inside. INT. KITCHEN \u00ad DAY \nRob and Kit are the first ones down. They enter from the dining room, surprising Muffy at the stove. \nKIT (BRISKLY) Good morning! \nMuffy turns abruptly, startled. Rob and Kit stop abruptly, too. \nANGLE \nMuffy is barefooted, dressed in an old, worn chenille robe. Her hair, normally carefully groomed, is unkempt, wild and stringy about her pale face. Talk about unguarded moments. Her present appearance, is the last way one would ever expect to find Muffy St. John. \n", "test2_id": 2092, "test3_input": "ROB (PLEADING ) Constable?... (LISTENS) Here. She's all right. (LISTENS) With Muffy? What do you mean? \nHe looks up at the others who have gathered around him expectantly. ROB (FINALLY) Yes, all right... Please... Please hurry. \nHe hangs up. Pause. \nROB (anything, but jubilant) He's on his way. We're supposed to wait here... to stay together... \nCHAZ What about the ferryman? \nROB It isn't him. They've been together all day. \nCHAZ What? \nKIT I don't understand. \nThey look at each other ominously. \nROB (STANDING) I don't either. (BEAT) He's going to send up a flare as he's nearing the dock. Then we're to go down as a group to meet him there. (MOVING AWAY) In the meantime... we just wait. \nHe goes out of the living room. \nINT. FRONT ENTRY - NIGHT \nRob bolts and double-locks the front door. He also fastens the chain just for good measure. \nINT. LIVING & DINING ROOMS - NIGHT \nChaz and Nikki secure all the doors and windows to the outside. \nINT. STUDY - NIGHT \nKit enters, checks and locks the windows. She turns on the lamp. On the desk -- prominently displayed and catching her eye -- a FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH. CLOSE - THE PHOTOGRAPH \nIt is a black-and-white picture, probably Muffy as a child. But what's confusing is there's another little girl next to her in the picture, who looks just like Muffy, too... \nKIT \n...doesn't understand. She glances at the walls for more pictures. \nMuffy enters suddenly, interrupting her. Kit startles, turning. They face each other. \nMUFFY (UNNATURALLY COMPOSED) It's my father's study. \nKIT (NERVOUSLY) I just came in to make sure everything was secure to lock the windows. \nMUFFY Good idea. Sometimes... with the tides... it can take someone all night to get here from the mainland... and even then, sometimes they don't make it... \nINT. HARVEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nHarvey is unlocking his suitcase which is back up on the bed. He reaches in and pulls out a small revolver. He drops the cylinder, checking to see that it's loaded, then snaps it back in place. He tucks the weapon into the waistband at the small of his back, then slips on his navy blazer. \nINT. BASEMENT - .NIGHT \nNo one is around and no one has been down here since earlier in the day when Muffy apparently brought down the painting with the vacant eye-holes from outsid~ Rob and Kit's bedroom. \nCAMERA PANS off the painting, now hung on a blank wall, to the transcan window which is still propped open to the outside. \nINT. LIVING ROOH \u00ad NIGHT \nChaz, Nikki, Kit and Harvey are here, trying to wait it out. \nHARVEY (peering out the window) What's taking him so long? KIT (quietly; without conviction) It could be the tides. \nCHAZ Wait a minute. Aren't we supposed to be staying together? Where're Muffy and Rob? \nKIT Rob's checking the back of the house. \nCHAZ And Muffy? \nNIKKI She's been acting less than normal anyway. \nKIT (picking up on it) What do you mean? \nNIKKI You mean all day and you haven't noticed? \nHARVEY Well, who isn't? \nNIKKI ...and those nurse's shoes. \n", "test3_true": "NIKKI The clodhoppers she's been wearing today... crepe soles... \nIt's as though some common nerve of suspicion has been touched. They all stir. \nHARVEY She was arguing with Nan in the hall, before you and Rob... before you came back alone. \nThey turn full attention on him. \nHARVEY About something Nan found in her room. \nCHAZ What? HARVEY (EMBARRASSED) Something about an abortion. \nThey all pause. \nNIKKI I found somethin\"g in my room, too \nShe reaches into her bag and pulls out the black rubber bondage hood. \nNIKKI ...only I don't think it was intended for me . \nCHAZ (SARCASTIC ) Oh, really? \nHARVEY (to Chaz; defending Nikki) And What did you find? \nCHAZ I didn't find anything. \nHARVEY We're supposed to believe that? \nCHAZ That's right. (TRUMPING HIM) I spent the night with Nikki. (BEAT) What about you? \nHARVEY What about me? \nCHAZ What's your little secret? \nHARVEY (EVASIVELY) I don't know What you're talking about. \nCHAZ Oh, come on, sport. I walked in on you last night , and you were acting like your ass was on fire... \nHARVEY It wasn't anything... Just some clippings... of some car accidents. CHAZ (INSINUATING) Nothing personal in that, I suppose? \nHARVEY No! Who hasn't been in a car accident? It's a common thing. \nCHAZ I haven't. \nThere is a slight pause. Rob comes into the living room, holding a flashlight and stands just inside the doorway. \nThe others shift uncomfortably. \nNIKKI (QUIETLY) What I'd like to know is, how did Muffy find out about these things and why -- ? \nKIT Stop it! Just stop it all of you! (BEAT) What is wrong with us? Nhat happened to all our talk about friendship, and undying loyalty? (looking from one to the other) Do you know what we're saying? That we're actually sitting here discussing the possibility that Muffy, a generous friend, has invited us all here to -- \nShe stops suddenly, freezing in mid-sentence, and they all turn, following the direction of her look, to see Muffy standing in the entryway behind Rob. \nMUFFY I'm going upstairs. \nROB Muffy? We should all stay together. \nMUFFY This is my house. (BEAT) I'll be in my room. \nShe turns and heads up the stairs. \nPause. NIKKI (FINALLY) She's got a point. (STANDING) We're starting to get on each other's nerves. \nHARVEY As long as we all stay within shouting distance of each other... \nNIKKI (TO CHAZ) You coming? \nHe joins her, and they quietly head for the stairs. \nROB I'm goinq to find the way up to the attic. \nKIT Why? \nROB I'm sure we can watch for the Constable better from up there. \nKit hesitates. \n", "test3_id": 2093}

{"train": "APRIL FOOL'S DAY \nWritten by \nDanilo Bach \nrev 1st draft July 30, 1986 \nFADE IN \nEXT. FERRY LANDING - NEW ENGLAND SHORE - DAY The sparkling waters. The chirping spring day. We are on an isolated stretch of country shore , and a quiet, sheltered island is visible distantly across the Sound. There is asense of anticipation, excitement. VOICES can be heard. THE CAMERA is the POV of a VIDEO CAMERA, and a group of college kids wait just o.s. On-screen, however, for the moment, a proper, sweet-faced young COED faces the camera and -- reluctantly, under the urging of her friend behind the video lens - - sets the scene. \nSWEET COED (SHYLY) Hi... My name is Mary O'Reilly O'Toole O'Shea and...over there is the island my friend Muffy owns... It's spring break... and she's invited us over for the weekend, and we're waiting for the ferry now to take us there... (blushing, mortified to cameraman) I don't know what else to say! \nCAMERAMAN (CHAZ'S VOICE) Tell us something about yourself. \nSWEET COED Something about myself? Oh, Gee... (composing herself, earnestly) Well, I want to work with handicapped children... My parents are my best Friends... Next semester I start convent school, and I... fuck on the first date. \nO.S. her friends explode with LAUGHTER. Brassy former deb NIKKI BRASHEARS gives us a big, wet wink, dropping the act. \nSWEET COED/NIKKI April Fool... \nCHAZ'S VOICE Whoo! Outrageous woman! Nikki, you are my kind o' gal! \nHe PANS THE CAMERA over to KIT-- a pretty, unaffected, natural beauty, bright and very much aware. \nCHAZ'S VOICE C'mon, Kit, how about you? \nKit waves him off, laughing in spite of herself. She's got nothing to say. KIT Pass. \nCHAZ'S VOICE C'mon , Arch? Skip? \nHe PANS over to the other two college boys on the dock here - ARCH, a big, good-natured, easygoing WASP jock (rugby and crew); and SKIP, Mr. Preppy, the perfect image of the lazy spoiled, indulged, and reckless upper-crust kid. Skip also happens to be Muffy's cousin. \nARCH (ponders it with due consideration) Yeah, sure... I fuck on the first date... \nSkip cracks up. Arch's laughter follows. \nNIKKI (O.S.) Where's Rob? \nChaz QUICK-PANS the camera back to Kit, following the action. \nCHAZ'S VOICE (teasing, with innuendo) Yeah, Kit, where is he? \nARCH (O.S.) (MORE TEASING) Oh, Kit... \nConcerned, Kit keeps her humor anyway, waving the lens away again. \nKIT Oh, c'mon, Chaz, give me some room, will you? \nHe does, finally shutting down the videopak. The image reverts to FILM again. \nNIKKI (looks at her, persisting) Well? INT. VOLVO WAGON IN MOTION - MAIN HIGHWAY - DAY \nCUT TO: \nThe driver -- a still great-looking, turned-out Fairfield County-type SUBURBAN LADY -- and the passenger, ROB FERRIS a cleancut, goodlooking, 20 year old public school grad \u00adsit in uncomfortable silence on opposite ends of the front seat. \nROB (gestures, awkwardly) Here'll be fine, thanks... \nEXT. HIGHWAY INTERSECTION - DAY \nThe Volvo wagon pulls over. Rob drags out his daypack, too. \nROB (ABASHED) Thanks... for the lift, I mean... \nSUBURBAN LADY (smiles, no reason for disappointment) It was a real lift for me, too, hon. \nA late model Detroit sedan slows at the intersection, turning off the highway to take the junction in the direction Rob is going. A road sign indicates: \"BAR HARBOR MOUNT DESERT\" in another direction. \nRob hefts his gear, hurrying to flag the sedan. \nThe Volvo wagon continues on, braking for the next undergraduate male hitchhiking down the road. \nINT. KITCHEN - ST. JOHN HOUSE- DAY CLOSE ON a wall calendar. A HAND reaches INTO FRAME, tearing off \"MARCH\" to begin \"APRIL\". \nWIDEN TO REVEAL CLARA, the middle-aged housekeeper and offseason caretaker for the house. With her overcoat and purse on one arm, she drops the \"MARCH\" calendar page in a wastebasket, then crosses to the pantry where a door and wooden steps lead down to the basement. \nCLARA (CALLING) The rooms are all in order, double- and triple-checked, and I'm on my way... \nThe large, raw-boned FERRYMAN holds open the wooden stile for the one and only passenger from the island \u00ad Clara -- to disembark. Clara passes them , giving first Skip and then the others a look, shaking her head in sad appraisal. FERRYMAN (cont.) (GROWLS) Ok, let's go. \nIt's not the friendliest greeting in the world. The ferryman keeps the stile open for them to board singly. There is also a younger assistant on board -- BUCK, a pleasant, openfaced townie in his 20s. \nFERRYMAN (cont.) To the rear. Outa the operator's way. \nNikki clutches at Skip's arm. \nNIKKI (IN MOCK-TERROR) This is it? No going back? Trapped for days on an island where men are men, and women oughta know better? \nARCH (BEHIND HER) Try to control yourself, Sister O'Toole. \nNIKKI (SUGGESTIVE ) You could tie me in chains... \nChaz boards, passing Buck, the assistant. \nCHAZ (a low whisper) Your fly's open, and your Hostess Twinkie's hanging out... \nThe assistant gapes, falling for it, groping his fly. Which is closed, of course. He looks up, grinning. Chaz kisses him on the cheek, winks and moves on. \nBUCK Sh -i-i-t... \nKit is hanging back on the dock. \nFERRYMAN Come on if you're coming. \nKIT (URGENTLY) Excuse me. But we're still waiting for somebody -- \nFERRYMAN (GRUFFLY) It's Friday. My last run of the week. I don't get paid overtime. KIT But you've got to wait. They said it's the only way over. If he misses this... \nArch WHISTLES loudly, seeing and alerting them. \nPARKING LOT - THEIR POV A late model Detroit sedan (the one we saw earlier turning off the highway) pulls to a fast stop in the lot. Rob hurries out; a CHEER comes up from the group on the ferry. Kit closes her eyes in relief. Rob comes hurrying up the ramp. \nANGLE \u00ad LANDING ...followed closely by HARVEY 'HAL' EDISON, JR. \nHARVEY Wait up! \nHarvey is the driver of the sedan, and after he carefully locks up, he comes running with his bag, too. He is a rangy, straight-arrow Ivy League farmboy from the Border South, and he's the last of Muffy's invited guests. He also, somewhat incongruously, sports a Bruce Springsteen badge. \nROB (to Kit, kissing her) Sorry... Nik, Chaz... (to Skip and Nan whom he doesn't know) Rob Ferris... \nThey return greetings. \nHARVEY (RIGHT BEHIND ) Hi! Harvey 'Hal' Edison, Jr., but please call me Hal. Only my folks call me Harve... and I can't stand it. Boy, this sure is a pretty spot. \nStylistically, he's a Martian. Chaz stares at him. \nCHAZ You're friends with... Muffy St. John? \nHARVEY (PROUDLY) Sure am. We sit together in Econ 345. I let her copy my marginal utility curves. \nNIKKI I get it. That's a joke. Preppy Skip adds his greeting. \nSKIP (an ironical nod) Harve. \nHARVEY (correcting him, blithely) Hal... (noticing interest his badge) Springsteen, he's still the Boss! \nFERRYMAN (IMPATIENTLY) Ok, c'mon, I don't have all day. \nHe slams the stile down after Harvey, the last to board, and gets busy with the stubborn motor. His assistant helps. Chaz tapes. \nHARVEY (enthusiastically, putting down his fear) YOU all buddies? \nNIKKI Except for Skip and Nan. Them we just met. \nKIT (AMIABLY) But we will be. \nCHAZ (MEANING SKIP) Watch what you say around him, though. He's Muffy's cousin. \nHARVEY (tickled, to Skip) No kiddin'? \nSKIP Distant. Over the horizon. Otherwise, I wouldn't be invited... (frowns, tellingly) Old money never mixes family with friends. \nNIKKI This is true. For as long as I've known her. \nKIT (JOKING) To protect her family, I guess. SKIP (UNSMILING) To keep her friends. \nHe turns to Arch, holds up his hand, and CLICK, a switchblade opens into the lens. \nNaked bodies writhing in heat. Women with their tongues sticking out in desparate desire... Nan tries to control her reaction to his stack of graphic pornographic video catalogues and magazines. \nCHAZ (CONT) The origins of American pornographic film. I'm taking an independent study this term. (the passion and commitment show) My advisor's really behind me on it. We're not gonna be sheltered college kids all our lives. Someday I'm gonna have kids -- you're gonna have kids \u00ad and someday that kid's gonna come up to me and say, 'God, Dad, porn's really a major part of our lives. You were there, how'd it get started?' I wanna be able to answer their questions. (SMILES) Besides, it's research I can do by myself. \nROB AND KIT They keep their voices low. KIT (STILL MIFFED) That's not my point -- \nROB You don't want me to hitch, you want me to buy a car. OK, but I'm a state university boy, I don't have the perks like some of you private college kids do. \nKIT Oh, c'mon, don't pull that. \nRob just drops his arms in frustration. \nKIT (cont.) I mean, it may show something about your attitude toward me, always being late. \nROB Kit... \nArch's voice interrupts. \nARCH'S VOICE (annoyed, loudly, overriding the other conversations) Hey, I'm really not interested anymore -- \nSKIP C'mon, just one more \nThe others look up at the interruption. \nANGLE \nArch pushes the knife back into Skip's hand, tired of playing knife- toss. \nARCH I said, enough's enough-- \nSKIP One more try, double or nothing. \nHe flips the knife to Arch, handle first. \nARCH (PISSED OFF) C'mon, give it a fuckin' rest! \nHe flips it back hard. Something happens. Skip looks up stunned. Arch's voice catches in his throat in horror. ANOTHER ANGLE \nSkip stares back, disbelieving, looking down and pulling his hand away from his chest, where the blood begins to seep and the jackknife sticks out, buried hilt-deep between his ribs. \nSKIP (PALE) Oh, fuck. \nSKIP Nan screams. Skip stumbles, teetering there at the edge of the ferry. Rob and Chaz leap to their feet. The ferrymen both look up in disbelief. Arch steps forward to help. But Skip, weaving, topples and splashes overboard. He goes under. \nARCH (panicked, hurrying to the side) I'll get him, I'll get him! \nBut he stops just at the edge of the ferry, immobilized by fear. \nRob rushes forward, with Chaz in reserve, pulling Arch out of \u00b7the way. But Buck, the assistant ferryman, pre-empts them all, diving in. \nArch, frozen, watches from the deck with the others. \nBuck resurfaces, but without any sign of Skip. Rob doesn't wait any longer. He pulls off his shoes and dives in. Chaz gets ready to follow suit. The panic mounts. Suddenly: \nSKIP'S VOICE Hi, this what you're looking for? \nTHEY TURN; \nANGLE CHANGE \nSkip pulls himself up, dripping, on the other side of the ferry. He holds up the knife -- and the padded sash beneath his shirt he used to imbed the knife -- and grins from ear to ear. The others stare, totally freaked. \nArch lets go, jumping in the air. Rob and Buck surface, to see as well. \nARCH We got 'em! Whoo-ee, did we nail 'em! CHAZ (as it dawns, to Skip) April Fools... you crazy jerks. You crazy motherfuckin' jerks... somebody could've gotten hurt out there! \nRelief descends. Rob isn't laughing. But nobody's more impressed than assistant Buck, still treading water. \nBUCK (GRINNING) SH-I-I-I-T \nNIKKI You maniacs... you almost gave us a heart attack! \nKit glowers at them and gives Rob a hand to get out. \nARCH (TO CHAZ) Well, at least we don't go in for this your-shoelace\u00adis-untied crap! \nROB (dripping, to Arch and Skip) I owe you one. \nSKIP (smiles, to Buck in the water) How's it goin' out there? \nNIKKI Come sit on daddy's knee, little girl... \nNikki falls to the floor in hysterics. \nKIT My goodness, daddy, what big (BREAKING UP) ...what big... teeth you have. \nALL The better to eat you with, my dear. \nINT. STUDY - LATE AFTERNOON \nA richly paneled room with a fireplace, desk, leather-upholstered chairs and lots of books. \nA door opens and Harvey steps through, looks back over his shoulder and enters. He is just snooping around. He surveys the books, the framed diplomas on the walls along with autographed photos of U.S. presidents and other heads of state. \nHe steps over to the desk, opens a cigar box sitting there, takes out a cigar and slips it into his pocket. EXT. BACK LAWN - SUNSET \nArch and Chaz are in the back lawn overlooking the sound. They are fooling around with Chaz's camera, maybe clowning a bit. \nEXT. VERANDA - THE SAME \nA'broad veranda which runs along the entire length of the back of the house. Skip and Nan are sitting on the railing, gazing over the sounds. Skip has a drink. \nSKIP (quietly, with deliberation) The poor boy can say, \"Fuck you, Dad. I'm my own person.\" What is his father going to do? Kick him out of the house? Disinherit him? His life won't have changed that much. He's got nothing to lose. \nPAUSE. \nNAN His father's love. \nSKIP That's already been lost. Died a long, long time ago. \nNAN (SOFTLY) Skip, you're giving up. You're giving up before you've even gotten started. (BEAT) Look at how young we all are. How young and foolish and innocent and stupid... \nSkip raises his glass and gulps down the rest of his drink. \nEXT. OVERLOOK - DUSK \nA secluded area halfway down between the house and the shore. Rob sits alone on a wooden bench and thinks. O.S. the dinner bell sounds. \nEXT. VERANDA - DUSK \nWith bell in hand, Muffy turns and heads back into the house. Chaz and Arch come up onto the porch and follow her in. \nINT. DINING ROOM ~ DUSK \nRob is just coming in from outside as Muffy enters from the kitchen with the hot dogs and beans. Everyone else is standing around the table. CHAZ Boy, Muff, you sure know how to make a guy look forward to dessert. \nARCH Please, God, let it be ding dongs. \nNIKKI St. John hospitality taken to the extreme. \nHARVEY I think it's real friendly. Makes me feel right at home. \nEveryone starts to sit down at his designated place. \nKIT How friendly will we feel once we've finished with those beans? \nON NAN \nAs soon as her ass hits the seat, she lets slip an outrageous fart. She springs to her feet, her face turning beet red. \nTHE GROUP \nAll conversation stops, each person looking for the guilty party. Nan discreetly sits back down: but again, as soon as her tail meets the chair, another blast escapes her... \nAll eyes are on her as she reaches beneath her and pulls out a whoopee cushion. \nNAN You guys! \nEverybody laughs. \nKIT So it's going to be one of those dinners, huh? \nArch is laughing the loudest when suddenly his chair collapses beneath him and he drops sprawling onto the floor. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nSkip is searching through the darkened living room for something, while in the adjoining room dinner is proceeding quietly. INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nCLOSE ON- CHAZ' HAND \nNAN (TENTATIVELY) Can I make a toast? \nThey turn attention toward her, and she stands, emboldened by their acceptance. NAN (CONT.) Well... Someone once said to me to cherish the friends you make in COLLEGE-- \nARCH I cherish all the friends I make. \nNAN (CONTINUING) Because... they'll be the friends you cherish most the rest of your life. So, well, here's to us... here's to my life... because I'm very glad to be here, and to be a part of all of you... \nKIT Muffy, anything you want to add to that? \nMUFFY Why me? \nNIKKI Because you're the hostess. \nMuffy thinks for a moment, then adds... \nMUFFY In his \"Life of Johnson\" James Boswell said, \"We cannot tell the precise moment when friendship is formed. As in filling a vessel drop by drop, there is at last a drop which makes it run over; so in a series of kindnesses, there is at last one which makes the heart run over.\" \nArch has started to make snoring sounds. \nMUFFY (cont.) So with this toast may our hearts run over and our friendships be formed. \nThey stand unanimously, raise their glasses in agreement, start to drink and spill it all down the front of their shirts. \nDribble glasses. \nEverybody groans. \nMUFFY (GRINNING MISCHIEVOUSLY) April Fool. INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY \u00ad NIGHT \nMuffy shows Nikki, the last of them, to her room. Nan says goodnight from her door. \nNAN Goodnight. \nMUFFY Goodnight. \nMuffy leads Nikki to a narrow, sparse single, popping open the door. \nNIKKI Oh, great. Quarantine. \nMUFFY (IMPISHLY) Just holler if you need anything. \nNIKKI Another room. (TURNS) Muffy... \nMuffy turns back to her. \nNIKKI (cont.) (beat, seriously) I know you and Arch had something going before I met him... \nMUFFY (SMILES) Arch is sweet, but he's only got two expressions. Collar up and collar down. \nNIKKI I found that out-- (BEAT) I guess what I'm trying to say is... you always seem to get there first... but this time Chaz is mine, OK? \nMUFFY (AMUSED) What about Hal? \nNIKKI ' Harvey? Mr. Junior Achievement? Oh please... \nMuffy returns her smile,continuing down the corridor. INT. ARCH'S POOM - UPSTAIRS - NIGHT \nArch throws his duffle bag on a bed, delighted. It's a private suite with two beds. \nARCH Hey, all right... ladies, we are qonna have privacy... \nHe turns his collar up on his polo shirt, then eagerly pushes the two beds together. \nThe other door (to the connecting bathroom) swings open. Arch's face drops as Chaz walks in, lugging his gear. \nARCH (CONT.) You gotta be kiddin'... \nCHAZ (unloading his gear). Unless Muffy knows something about us we don't. \nHe blows Arch a kiss, pulling the two beds apart again. \nINT. HARVEY'S ROOM - NIGHT \nCLOSE UP a match flaring to life. \nWIDEN TO FEVEAL Harvey lighting the cigar he took earlier out of the study. He puffs on it contentedly, imagining himself a man of power. Then he steps over to the bed and opens his suitcase to begin unpacking. \nHARVEY (to himself; rehearsing) Don't tell me you've never thought of me in that way, Muffy. I felt a spark between us the very first moment we laid eyes on each other... in Econ 345. Why, just think of it, Muffy... with my talent and your... money. \nCHAZ Me too! \nEXT. DOCK - DAY \nAs Rob, Arch and Chaz come running down to the water. They stop and look around, seeing nothing. \nNo answer. \nARCH (aloud: for Skip) Hey, asshole! \nCHAZ Wait a minute! Look at this! \nHe has found on the little pebbled beach beside the dock, Skip's switchblade. It is in pieces. There's blood on the broken blade. \nCHAZ This was Skip's. ARCH What do you think? That guy on the ferry? \nROB I don't know. I don't know what to think. \nARCH I say we go looking for him, him or Skip. One of them's bound to still be around... somewhere. \nCHAZ You mean split up? \nROB Let's not take any chances. He was... He was pretty big. \nARCH No sucker's taken me yet. \nHe rips a loose board off the dock for a club. \nEXT. UTILITY ROOM - HOUSE \u00ad DAY \nIn the gathering twilight, Muffy puts the basket of mushrooms away on a shelf. Someone grabs her wrist. She gasps. It's Nan. Nan steps from the shadows. \nNAN I know why you're avoiding me... (DISTRAUGHT) I guess it's your idea of a joke... that's why you invited me. How'd you find out? From one of his preppy 'friends'? Who else have you told?... Who else knows, except the father! \nMUFFY (ASTONISHED) I... don't know what you're talking about. \nNAN Oh? The tape just got there? You know very well... my abortion! \nShe comes apart, in tears. Muffy stares, uncomprehending. \nNAN (cont.) I thought you wanted to be friends... you think you can play with people's feelings just because you're rich and can do what you want. Well, you can't...! \nShe rushes out the rear door. Muffy tries to recover, confused. \nShe continues on to the back entrance to the kitchen. INT. KITCHEN - DAY \nSwinging open the door, she almost runs into Harvey. \nHARVEY (SHEEPISHLY) Sorry... I was just checkin' to make sure everybody was all right. \nHe beats a hasty retreat the other way, passing Nikki on her way in Nikki raises an eyebrow at Muffy, misinterpreting the tension in the air. \nNIKKI Harvey? No kidding'? \nMaybe that explains your clothes. \nMUFFY (NERVOUSLY) What d'you, mean? \nNIKKI Oh, c'mon. \nMuffy exits hurriedly, upset. \nEXT. WOODS - DAY \nThe path is narrow and tortuous . Arch uses his club to clear the way, trying to follow its twists and turns. He also tries to make vocal contact. \nARCH Hey, shithead! chickendick!... yeah, you! Skip! \nHe moves deeper and deeper into the forest. \nLOW ANGLE \nUp ahead on the pathway a thick, black viper slithers out of the undergrowth, stops, sensing Arch's presence, and coils itself against his approach. \nWIDER \nas Arch stalks forward, not looking at the ground. \nLOW ANGLE ARCH (THUNDERING ) Skip! \nKIT Rob? No, we haven 't been able to get through to the mainland yet. \nMuffy eases. Kit turns the tap to fill the kettle. The pipes begin to BANG. The tap sputters and coughs out a spurt of brown water before running dry. \nL1UFFY Oh... \u00b7the main... it's probably broken. \nKIT (STUNNED) No water? \nNikki and Harvey enter, having heard the pipes banging. \nNIKKI What's happening. \nKIT No water. NIKKI What! \nMUFFY It happens sometime... But there's still the well all the island homes have some kind of pump... or well... for emergencies. \nNikki reaches for a large flashlight beam. \nNIKKI Jesus. I'll go. Just point me in the right direction. \nHARVEY (GALLANTLY) Not without me. \nHarvey accompanies Nikki out the back door, leaving Kit and Muffy alone again. \nMUFFY (bearing up under Kit's stare) I'm not worried. I'm sure those two... Skip and Art... they're just up to some kind of stupid trick . . . \nKit moves out of the kitchen uneasily. \nEXT. WELL - DUSK Nikki milkes ghost sound8, following Harvey out through the dark. It makes him nervous. \nHARVEY (UNCOMFORTABLY) I don't think you should really do that. \nNIKKI (SEEING) Is that it? \nThe well is the old-fashioned kind. \nNIKKI (cont.) Boy, when she said `well,' she really meant 'well'. who dug this thing? Pocahontas? \nShe reaches for the wooden bucket attached by metal nook to the thick rope. Harvey pre-empts. \nHARVEY Here, let me do it. I've probably had more experience than you. \nNIKKI You mean, back home on the farm? HARVEY I know you think I'm a hick, but I'd like to change your mind about that, if you'd only give me the chance. \nNIKKI Why? \nHARVEY Because, I'd really like to plow your field. \nNIKKI (SMILES\" IMPRESSED) Draw me some water. \nHe's glad to oblige, opening the hinged wood well cover and lowering the bucket slowly. The dark hole seems to go on forever. Suddenly, there's a muffled CLATTER deep within the well. \nHARVEY Aw, crap... \nNIKKI What happened? \nHARVEY I lost the bucket. \nNIKKI Harve. \nHARVEY Hal. The rope was rotten, any fool coulda seen that. \nNIKKI You didn't. \nHARVEY Here, shine your light down so I can get a fix on it. \nShe rises on her toes, flashing the powerful beam down the dank hole. Harvey bends over to look. A rotted piece of the well cover breaks off in his hand. He lurches forward. \nHARVEY Oh... oh, Jesus! \nHe slams back in ashen horror. \nNIKKI (STARTLED} ...what... HARVEY Stay back! Don't look! \nNIKKI I'm a big girl now. I think I \u00b7can handle a few spiders and FROGS --- \nShe shines the beam down again, bending in for a look. \nHARVEY NIKKI -- \nROB (PLEADING ) Constable?... (LISTENS) Here. She's all right. (LISTENS) With Muffy? What do you mean? \nHe looks up at the others who have gathered around him expectantly. ROB (FINALLY) Yes, all right... Please... Please hurry. \nHe hangs up. Pause. \nROB (anything, but jubilant) He's on his way. We're supposed to wait here... to stay together... \nCHAZ What about the ferryman? \nROB It isn't him. They've been together all day. \nCHAZ What? \nKIT I don't understand. \nThey look at each other ominously. \nROB (STANDING) I don't either. (BEAT) He's going to send up a flare as he's nearing the dock. Then we're to go down as a group to meet him there. (MOVING AWAY) In the meantime... we just wait. \nHe goes out of the living room. \nINT. FRONT ENTRY - NIGHT \nRob bolts and double-locks the front door. He also fastens the chain just for good measure. \nINT. LIVING & DINING ROOMS - NIGHT \nChaz and Nikki secure all the doors and windows to the outside. \nINT. STUDY - NIGHT \nKit enters, checks and locks the windows. She turns on the lamp. On the desk -- prominently displayed and catching her eye -- a FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH. CLOSE - THE PHOTOGRAPH \nIt is a black-and-white picture, probably Muffy as a child. But what's confusing is there's another little girl next to her in the picture, who looks just like Muffy, too... \nKIT \n...doesn't understand. She glances at the walls for more pictures. \nMuffy enters suddenly, interrupting her. Kit startles, turning. They face each other. \nMUFFY (UNNATURALLY COMPOSED) It's my father's study. \nKIT (NERVOUSLY) I just came in to make sure everything was secure to lock the windows. \nMUFFY Good idea. Sometimes... with the tides... it can take someone all night to get here from the mainland... and even then, sometimes they don't make it... \nINT. HARVEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nHarvey is unlocking his suitcase which is back up on the bed. He reaches in and pulls out a small revolver. He drops the cylinder, checking to see that it's loaded, then snaps it back in place. He tucks the weapon into the waistband at the small of his back, then slips on his navy blazer. \nINT. BASEMENT - .NIGHT \nNo one is around and no one has been down here since earlier in the day when Muffy apparently brought down the painting with the vacant eye-holes from outsid~ Rob and Kit's bedroom. \nCAMERA PANS off the painting, now hung on a blank wall, to the transcan window which is still propped open to the outside. \nINT. LIVING ROOH \u00ad NIGHT \nChaz, Nikki, Kit and Harvey are here, trying to wait it out. \nHARVEY (peering out the window) What's taking him so long? KIT (quietly; without conviction) It could be the tides. \nCHAZ Wait a minute. Aren't we supposed to be staying together? Where're Muffy and Rob? \nKIT Rob's checking the back of the house. \nCHAZ And Muffy? \nNIKKI She's been acting less than normal anyway. \nKIT (picking up on it) What do you mean? \nNIKKI You mean all day and you haven't noticed? \nHARVEY Well, who isn't? \nNIKKI ...and those nurse's shoes. \nHARVEY It's all right. I can keep watch on the stairs. \nRob ho1ds out his hand to her. She takes it and they walk together toward the stairs. \nINT. MUFFY' S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nMuffy enters, closes the door quietly and locks it behind her. She crosses to her bed, slowly sits down and loses herself in troubled thought about everything that is going on. \nINT. MAIN STAIRWAY \u00ad NIGHT \nHarvey steps up to the halfway landing and sits down. He looks above, looks below, then opens a magazine and begins thumbing through it. \nINT. NIKKI'S ROOM - NIGHT \nNikki's suitcase is open on the bed, and she is moving nervously about the room, gathering her things and cramming them into it. \nCHAZ Nikki, come on... NIKKI What do you mean, Nikki, come on? Don't give me any of this Nikki, come on. \nCHAZ What are you doing? \nNIKKI Look, stay if you like. Lock your door. Dig a trench. Hang out. But once I leave this place, I'm never coming back. \nShe walks out the door, and Chaz follows her to... \nINT. UPSTAIRS HALL - SAME \nThey cross the hall. \nCHAZ (catching up to her) We're all supposed to stay together here. \nNIKKI Yeah, that's been real effective... \nShe goes into... \nINT. BATHROOM - SAME \n...and starts to collect all her stuff from in here. Chaz comes in behind her. \nCHAZ So what are you going to do? Just waltz on down to the pier. By yourself. Check your bag with the porter. Then wait for an ocean liner to happen by and pick you up. Is that it? \nNIKKI, (pushing past him) I can't stay here any longer. \nShe goes back out into the hallway. Chaz follows. \nINT. UPSTAIRS HALL - SAME \nas they cross back to Nikki's bedroom. \nCHAZ What if the Constable never even comes? \nNIKKI Then I'll swim all the way back to the mainland... I can be strong if I have to. INT. NIKKI'S ROOM - NIGHT \nas they re-enter. \nCHAZ Look, just relax-- \nNIKKI Three people are dead and you're telling me to relax? CHAZ Nikki, now just hold on a minute, and look at me. Look at me. \nShe stops and looks at him. \nCHAZ (CONT.) Now, am I nervous? Yes. Maybe even a little bit scared? Yes. Am I running around like a chicken with its head cut off? \nNIKKI Nice image. \nCHAZ No. (BEAT) I mean, come on, babe. Lighten up a little, huh? \nHe quickly slips the S&M mask over his head, clowning around. \nCHAZ (CONT.) (MUFFLED) Look at this. What, me worry? \nNIKKI Very funny, Chaz. \nCHAZ (MUFFLED) You've got to look on the bright side of things. Everything'll be all right... Huh? Huh? \nNIKKI Don't be a jerk. \nCHAZ (MUFFLED) Oh. Now I'm turning you on. Right? \nNIKKI, Take that thing off. CHAZ (MUFFLED) Why? I kind of like it in here. (moving blindly toward her) Kiss me, you savage she-devil. \nKIT She's been up here. \nROB So? She moves toward them while Rob stays by the windows looking out. As she gets closer to the dolls, however, Kit realizes that they have not just been stuck there haphazardly. \nKIT (ALARMED) Rob? \nRob comes over to join her as we CUT TO: \nHER POV \nof the dolls as the flashlight moves across them, slowly revealing them one by one. The last to be seen are a Barbie and the heads of two Kens stuck in a bowl of water. \nROB AND KlT \nstaring at them, frightened and astonished. \nROB Jesus... \nKIT (LOSING IT) Rob? . . . \nROB It's Arch and Skip and Nan. \nKIT Rob??... \nROB Wait... \nHe takes the flashlight from her and reveals two more: a Barbie and a Ken lying next to each other with no clothes on, both of them splattered with bright red nail polish. \nROB What are these other two? \nSuddenly the room is flooded with light. Rob turns sharply and sees outside the window the Constable's flare hanging in the night sky. \nROB He's here! \nO.S. there is a PISTOL SHOT from downstairs. Kit screams. ROB Come on! \nHe jumps to his feet, grabs hold of her hand and pulls her with him out of the attic. \nINT. UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT \nas they come racing down from the attic. Rob heads for the main staircase... \nROB Hal! \n...while Kit runs down the hall to Nikki's room and flings open the door. \nKIT Nikki? \nShe isn't there. \nKit backs into the hallway. Downstairs O.S. she can hear Rob moving about, calling for Harvey, but up here all is quiet and threatening. \nShe hurries silently down to Chaz' room, opens the door and steps inside. \nINT. CHAZ' ROOM - NIGHT \nIt is dark again in here, but the video camera is still operating. Kit closes the door behind her and leans forward, barely whispering... \nKIT Chaz?... Nikki?... \nShe turns on the light and sees the bed, both beds: they are drenched in blood. \nKit reaches for the doorknob. It comes off in her hand. \nKIT Rob!!! \nShe's frantically pounding on the door and trying to jam the doorknob back in, to get it to work. \nThere's a NOISE outside the window. She turns aghast. Suddenly the door flies open. ROB (ENTERING) I can't find Hal-- \nHe stops in mid-sentence as he sees the beds. Kit is already through the door. Rob follows her out. \nINT. UPSTAIRS HALL . - NIGHT \nRob is running with her toward the stairs. \nKIT Rob, what about Muffy? \nROB Forget her! \nROB The house. Didn't Muffy say there was another key back in the kitchen? \nKIT (IN DREAD) Oh, no... \nROB We've got no choice. \nKIT I know. \nROB Shit. \nPAUSE \nKIT Rob? \nROB Huh? \nKIT Rob, I really don't want to go back there. \nROB I know. \nKIT Shit. \nAnother pause. Neither one is making the move to go. \nROB I'd have you stay here, but-- \nKIT No. \nROB (BEAT) Listen, Kit, we'll get out of here, I promise you. We've been through so much together... \nShe has started to cry softly. ROB (cont.) ...it isn't going to end here. \nKIT (BEING BRAVE) Okay. \nHe kisses her. Pause. \nROB Well... \nKIT Yeah... \nROB Let's go. \nKIT Let's go. \nROB Let's go. \nBrief pause, then he turns to go. \nROB Shit... \nThey move slowly off the dock. \nEXT. GROUNDS OF HOUSE - NIGHT \nRob and Kit move up to the shrubbery skirting the back lawn and gaze across at the house. It is completely dark within and remains wrapped in silence as before. \nKIT Rob, look! The doors. They've been closed. \nSure enough, the doors they come out by minutes ago, the ones they didn't stop to close, are now shut tight. \nROB Come on. \nThey move stealthily through the bushes around to the side of the house. They stop. \nROB There. He is pointing toward the open basement window across a thirty foot space of clear lawn. \nROB That's how we're going in. \nKit swallows hard. \nShe nods. \nROB Are you with me? \nThey break from their cover and run, keeping low, to the side of the house. Rob peers through the window into the darkness inside , pushes the transom all the way open, and then drags himself through on his belly. \nINT. BASEMENT - NIGHT \nHe drops to the floor, turning to give Kit a hand. She enters the same, dusting herself off next to him. Rob turns on the flashlight, using it cautiously. \nINT. PANTRY \u00ad NIGHT \nKit scrambles up behind him. They can hear Buffy outside in the yard APPROACHING the kitchen door. \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nRob and Kit hurry in. Rob searches frantically for the key board. \nROB The boat key... it's gotta be here... \nHis flashlight sweeps the walls of shelves. Suddenly, Buffy is at the kitchen door. Though the door in locked, there's no bolt or chain to fully secure it. The knob RATTLES furiously under Buffy's grip, the door SHUDDERS. \nRob spots a walk-in cupboard. He hurries to it. Kit gropes along the shelves, searching the objects hanging along the distant wall. \nKITCHEN DOOR \nA long, ugly-looking knife blade slips in through the crack in the door. Buffy is using it to try to pry open the door. \nCUPBOARD \nRob opens the door. Success. His beam falls on the key board on the inner wall. \nROB Kit... I \nHe steps in, following his beam into the darkness. The cupboard door SLAMS shut behind him. He turns, trapped. \nCLOSE ANGLE - KITCHEN DOOR \nThe door springs open. \nKITCHEN \nKit spins, crying out as she sees: \nHER POV \nThe shadowed figure of BUFFY, barefooted, disheveled, in a smock, dagger in hand. She advances, breathing heavily. KIT \nstumbles back desperately. \nKIT No... \nINT. CUPBOARD Rob is desperately trying to break out, but the door won't open. \nROB Kit! Let me out! Let me out of here! Kit!! \nHe is kicking the door, hurling himself at the door, but all to no effect. He barely has room to maneuver. \nKIT (O.S.) Rob!!! \nINT. KITCHEN Kit turns to Rob's voice, takes a step toward the cupboard, but suddenly Buffy is there, cutting her off. \nKit backes away, into the dining room. \nINT. CUPBOARD \nROB (POUNDING FUTILELY) Kit! Run, Kit, run! \nINT. DINING ROOM \nKit reels back under Buffy's steady advance. Kit can't see her clearly in the dim light, but she can make out, beneath Buffy's wild, stringy, dangling hair, the madness, the likeness of Muffy -- the familiar face somehow twisted by hate and madness into a stiff, hideous, unnatural deformation. \nBuffy closes in, readying the long, greedy knife. \nINT. CUPBOARD \nRob, still struggling, knows Kit is about to die. \nROB Kit! I love you! \nINT . DINING R.OOM \nCornered, helpless, Kit stumbles back toward the closed double doors that lead to the living room. KIT Buffy?... please, we didn't mean any harm... we're leaving... we just want to go home... please... please... \nBuffy raises the dagger in hand. \nINT. CUPBOARD \nNo longer trying to escape. It's hopeless. \nROB (TO OTHERS) And you guys played along? \nARCH Don't look at me! \nNIKKI We all got sucked in just as bad as you! MUFFY Once they were killed off, yes. Everybody had to cooperate. Otherwise, none of it would have worked! \nROB So I guess there's no crazy twin sister Buffy? \nMUFFY Oh, there's a crazy twin all right, but his name isn't Buffy. \nNIKKI His name? \nMuffy smiles, directing attention toward \"cousin\" Skip. \nCHAZ Skip?! \nKIT He's your brother?! \nARCH You bastard, you were in on the whole deal, too. \nSKIP (PROTESTING) Only the set-up. Muffy told me to say I was her cousin and to pull that prank on the ferry. I had no idea what was going to happen with Buck. \nMUFFY (INTRODUCING) Buck Williams. make-up artist par excellence, from Hollywood. \nBuck reaches down and tosses Arch's decapitated head to him. \nBUCK Here, catch. \nArch bobbles the head nervously. The others laugh. \nBUCK Just some old props I redressed with the help of photographs Muffy sent me. \nNIKKI It sure fooled me. \nARCH (TO SKIP) So what castle are you going to inherit? CONSTABLE POTTER (CRITICALLY) Well, first he's got to prove he can manage his own allowance. \nKIT (to the Constable) Which means, I guess, that you're no constable either. \nMUFFY Kit Graham, meet my Uncle Frank St. John of St. John et Freres, Wall Street. \nUncle Frank smiles and waves at Kit, but Harvey steps right over to him and starts pumping his hand. \nHARVEY Hi! Harvey \"Hal\" Edison, Jr. Pleased to meet you, sir. \nMUFFY Usually we don't even see Uncle Frank in the summer, he's so busy. But this time he made an exception. UNCLE FRANK I haven't had this much fun since my Hasty pudding Show sophomore year at Harvard. God, lowe you kids! \nFERRYMAN CAL (EAGERLY) How'd I do? I never did no acting before. Boy, was I shaking! \nMUFFY Cal's our regular ferryman between the mainland and the islands around here... but I thought he was up to the dramatic challenge. (BEAT: SMILING) Well, that's it. Now you know it all. \nNIKKI We have been had. \nROB You're lucky you didn't get yourself killed. \nMUFFY (LAUGHING) I almost did with Harvey. And who could know there would be a snake out in the woods with Arch? But with the paying guests, they'll know what they're in for: and the scenario won't be nearly so extreme. \nUNCLE FRANK Otherwise, even Lloyd's of London won't cover you. MUFFY ...And I regret that, well, some of those fake clues I planted in the bedrooms I guess were taken too seriously. I'm sorry about that. \nShe avoids looking at Nan so as not to draw attention to her. \nMUFFY (cont.) But we had fun, didn't we? I mean, come on. \nShe starts passing .out chilled champagne bottles to the men to open, and setting up glasses on a sideboard. \nMUFFY (cont.) I know I'll never forget this weekend for as long as I live. \nARCH You're telling me. Man, when I was swinging around out there in the woods, I nearly crapped my pants. \nCAL What do you mean, nearly? I was there, remember? \nSilence. Arch turns red. \nCHAZ (QUIETLY) Arch? You browned your trousers? \nARCH (BEAT; STAMMERING) Well... I... \nUNCLE FRANK (GOOD-NATUREDLY) It's all right, Arch. They'll be out of the dryer soon. \nSuddenly everyone roars with laughter. Champagne corks start popping, and before you know it, the scene is resembling the locker room of the winning team of a championship series. \nRob and Kit come out the door and stop beside Muffy. \nMore honking. \nKIT Well, I hate to say it -- I still ought to kill you -- but thanks. (THEY HUG) See you back there. \nUNCLE FRANK Come on. If time is money, we're losing a fortune. \nNikki now runs out followed closely by Harvey. They say their quick farewells and move along to the waiting vehicles. \nHarvey discreetly opts to ride in the pickup, while Nikki climbs aboard the van, passing Chaz who just glares at her. He knows. Finally Nan comes out of the house. With a curt nod to Muffy, she heads on toward the van when... \nMUFFY Nan! \nShe hurries to catch up with her. \nMUFFY Let me say again how sorry I am. It wasn't intended. NAN And now all is forgiven. I played along, didn't I? What's done is done. (BEAT) I've learned a lot, Muffy, I really have. I suppose I should say thank you, but I don't think I would be able to without it sounding false. So I'll just say goodbye. (beat; an afterthought) Thanks for showing me your house. \nShe turns and crosses to the van and climbs aboard. The others callout their last goodbyes. Muffy waves, and then they are gone and Muffy turns and walks forlornly back into her house. \nEXT. FERRY LANDING - MORNING \nCal and Uncle Frank are the first ones onto the ferry. \nUNCLE FRANK Cal, I want to thank you personally. You've been a real sport about this. \nCAL Aw, it was fun. \nUNCLE FRANK I know you've had your eye on that p1ace ever since we were kids. And I'm sure we could make a deal with you. I know you haven't been spending your money on anything else all these years... But... this time it just isn't in the cards. \nCAL It's still in the family. \nUNCLE FRANK Yes, that's the way. \nHe moves on. Others are passing them now. Chaz stops and wags his finger at Cal. \nCHAZ This time, no funny business. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING \nMuffy stand, overlooking the mess. Not knowing exactly where to begin, she starts emptying ashtrays into each other, then just stops. \nShe walks out of the living room and through the entry hall and slowly climbs the stairs. EXT. SOUND \u00ad DAY \nFrom far away the ferry can be seen chugging away, slowly returning to the mainland. \nEXT. FERRY - DAY \ncloser now we can see what's happening on board... Rob and Skip lean against the rail and talk quietly. Kit and Arch and Buck sit together and chat... Chaz sits alone, and Nikki sits apart from him, also alone. \nNan is up front, gazing out over the bow, while Harvey stands beside her trying to make conversation. Finally, he gives up and strolls to the back of the craft, pointedly passing Nikki. \nHe alights next to Uncle Frank, who has his briefcase open on his lap. \nNow Nikki stands and goes and sits down next to Chaz. \nCHAZ (BEAT) Feeling better? \nNIKKI (QUIETLY) I'm okay now, thanks. \nPause. \nNIKKI Chaz, I'm sorry. \nCHAZ Why? What do we mean to each other anyway? \nNIKKI More than this a couple of days ago. \nCHAZ (SMILES SADLY) A couple of days ago... A couple of days ago I was a great, young, budding filmmaker who was going to turn pornography into high art. Today I'm just a stupid college kid with a toy camera and about as much idea as where he's going as... as... \nHe gives up. \nNIKKI (TENDERLY) Don't be down. CHAZ Sure. \nPause. \nNIKKI I'll tell you what I've learned from all this. I'm tired of having one fling after another. I don't want any more of that. I want a boyfriend. (BEAT) Chaz? Will you be my boyfriend? \nHe looks at her, slowly softening. Yes, he will. \nThe phone on the bedstand RINGS. Muffy answers it on the second ring. \nMUFFY (SLEEPILY) H'lo? \nINTERCUT WITH: \nEXT. LANDING - DAY \nSkip is talking on a pay phone. \nSKIP (CHEERILY) Hi, it's me. Surprise. \nMUFFY (grumpily, stirring) What'd you forget now? \nSKIP Nothing. Just calling to tell you the party's not over. \nShe moans. \nMUFFY I know. The clean-up's going to take Clara and me at least a week. \nSKIP No, I mean, some of the gang's planning on coming back to give you some of your own medicine. \nCU MUFFY \nComing awake. \nMUFFY You're kidding. SKIP Does a bear shit in the woods? \nMUFFY Those bastards... \nSKIP Hey, they're your friends. \nMUFFY Which ones? \nSKIP That wouldn't be very sporting if I told you, would it? \nMUFFY (INSISTENT) Skip... \nSKIP Rob and Kit and Nikki and Chaz. \nMUFFY Figures... Thanks. \nSKIP Well, Uncle Frank told me about his recommendations. So, I didn't want you to think there were any hard feelings. \nMUFFY (AFFECTIONATELY) Oh, Skip, you dope. You know Daddy'll come around just as soon as you decide to buckle down. \nSKIP Yeah... (BEAT) Anyway, don't let the bastards eat you up. \nMUFFY I'll try not to act too surprised when they arrive. \nSKIP I love you, Sis. \nMUFFY You too, goofball. \nSkip hangs up. \nARCH (O.S.) Asshole. SKIP I beg your pardon? \nANGLE WIDENS to include Arch, who has been standing beside Skip the entire time. \nARCH It was even your idea. \nSKIP A petty consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds. \nARCH Bullshit. St. John blood is thicker than water, that's what you mean. \nSKIP (ARCHLY SARCASTIC) Don't you know? Old money sticks together. \nArch goes to his car and drives away. \nAt some distance, Harvey is \u00b7chasing down Uncle Frank as the latter closes in on his Mercedes sedan. \nHARVEY Well, can I look you up in a couple of months? Maybe you could arrange a job interview for me. \nUNCLE FRANK Sure, sure . (reaches into his pocket) Here's my card. \nHARVEY (TAKING IT) Thank you, sir. Thanks a lot. I sure appreciate it, and it's been a real pleasure meeting you. \nBut Uncle Frank is already in the car and starting it up. Harvey looks down at the card. \nMUFFY Nikki, what on earth are you doing here? Is something wrong? \nNIKKI No, no, nothing's wrong. Chaz and I just figured there was nothing we had to get back to that couldn't wait and you could probably use a hand with the clean-up. It's our way of saying thank you. \nMUFFY Oh, great. Where is Chaz? \nNikki is already moving into the living room. \nNIKKI Putting the boat up in the old boathouse. He'll be up in a minute. \nEXT. DOCK AND BOAT HOUSE \u00ad NIGHT \nNobody around and no sign of a boat... \nEXT. FRONT OF THE HOUSE - NIGHT \n...still and waiting \nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nMuffy and Nikki are seated across from each other. \nNIKKI I wonder what's keeping Chaz? He should have been up here by now. \nMUFFY Maybe he stopped to shit in the woods. You know Chaz. \nNIKKI Still... I'm beginning to not like this. \nMUFFY By the way, where did you get the boat to come back here? \nNIKKI The boat? Oh, Cal gave us one. \nMUFFY I see. \nPAUSE. NIKKI Listen, I need a drink of water. (RISING) You just stay here. I can get it myself. \nShe walks out of the living room. Muffy looks after her and smiles to herself. \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nas Nikki enters. She doesn't turn on any lights, but simply crosses to one of the kitchen windows and opens it. \nShe gazes out into the night for a moment, then backs out of the kitchen... \nINT. DINING ROM - NIGHT \n...pulling the swinging door closed behind her. She turns, takes two steps toward the living room and stops; remembering her water. \nShe goes back to the kitchen door, but suddenly it will not open for her. Frustrated, she heads back through the dining room, but stops dead halfway across and turns slowly and looks back at the kitchen door. She goes out of the dining room... \nINT . DOWNSTAIRS HALL - SAME \n...and walks up to the other door into the kitchen. It too it's closed and will not yield. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nas Nikki returns. \nMUFFY What about your water? \nNIKKL Oh', uh, I drank 'it in there. (BEAT) Listen. Muffy , I'm really getting worried about Chaz. I think we should go out and see what's happened. \nMUFFY That's okay. You go. I'll wait here. \nNIKKI No, really. I don't want to go alone. I'm still scared from last night. Please come with me. MUFFY I'm sure Chaz is fine. I'll stay here by the phone just in case. It's safer this way. (BEAT) Do you want a flashlight? \nNIKKI (IRRITATED) No, that's okay. I'll be fine. \nShe strides out of the living room. \nEXT. HOUSE - SAME as Nikki comes out the front door and heads off into the woods. \nNIKKI (MUTTERING) Shit. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nMuffy sits quietly a moment, thinking. Then she gets up and goes toward the kitchen. \nINT. DOWNSTAIRS HALL - \nNIKKI Chaz, get up! \u00b7Hurry, Chaz!... come on! \nHe doesn't move. NIKKI Chaz, stop playing around! Get up!! \nShe starts kicking him in the side. \nNIKKI Chaz! \nChaz doesn't stir, but he does speak now without moving his lips. \nCHAZ (hissing, pretending to be dead) Will you quit kicking me? It hurts. \nNIKKI It's supposed to hurt! The game's over! Get up! \nCHAZ (still not moving) No. I'm dead. You're blowing the whole thing. Where's Muffy? \nNIKKI (SHRIEKING) Muffy IS dead!!! In the house!!! (WHIMPERING) Oh, God... \nCHAZ (sitting up suddenly) What? \nNIKKI (turning to the woods) Kit! Kit, come out! \nThere is rustling O.S., then Kit starts to emerge. \nKIT What's going on? \nINT. STUDY - SAME \nMuffy is still lying face down as we saw her last. She hears footsteps going upstairs. \nINT. ATTIC - SAME \nRob is creeping up the attic stairs when he hears footsteps o.s. too. He pauses, his face draining of color. EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT \nas Chaz, Nikki and Kit come racing up to the door and run inside. \nINT. STUDY - SAME \nas they come charging in... \nNIKKI She's gone! \nNothing left, but the pool of blood and a thin trail of smeared drying blood to indicate that she's been dragged away. \nKIT What?... \nCHAZ Look, she's been dragged away. \nNIKKI (PANICKING) Chaz! somebody's still in this house! \nCHAZ We could follow the trail. \nKIT (DREAD) Oh, no... what about Rob? (HALF BEAT) Rob!! \nShe races out of the study. \nINT. ATTIC - NIGHT \nThe three of them come clambering up the stairs, Kit in the lead. They turn a corner. Then they see him... dead on the floor. \nKIT Rob...? \nThey run over to him. \nKIT (dropping to her knees) Rob? Rob?? (shaking him: wailing) Rob!!! (dissolving into tears) It was only a game! CHAZ (SCARED SHITLESS) What the fuck is going on here?! \nNIKKI (POINTING) Chaz, look! \nClutched in Rob's lifeless hand is a leather bookmark we may have noticed before. Chaz slips it out from beneath his fingers. \nCHAZ (DAZED) This was Nan's... \nNIKKI (TREMBLING) Nan... \nSuddenly there is a loud KNOCK beneath them O.S. They all look up. Someone is coming slowly up the stairs, the loud footsteps O.S.that could only be made by a heavy boot, thundering closer... and closer... \nKit and Nikki and Chaz huddle around Rob's body and await their approaching doom. \nSuddenly a dark figure fills the doorframe at the top of the stairs. A hand with a knife is raised. \u00b7Nikki screams. Chaz spies a lamp on the floor. He turns it on... \n", "test1_input": "MUFFY What's going on? Sam... what's wrong? \nCONSTABLE POTTER (IN DISGUST) Tricks. Pranks. Better ask your friends... Buck's been hurt. 'Cal just took him on over to the mainland. Just lucky I was here... \nShe returns his stare in dread silence. He boards the ferry. \nCONSTABLE POTTER (CONT.) I came over to check on a report of some unauthorized activity in the area... Your dad around? \nShe startles, the question 50 unanticipated. \nMUFFY No, he's in Sutton Place. Why? \nCONSTABLE POTTER No word from him, or anybody else? \nMUFFY (STILL PUZZLED) No... \nHe tries the engine. Nothing. \nCONSTABLE POTTER Just like I thought. . Burned out. Worthless... \nHe steps back onto the shore. \nCONSTABLE POTTER (CONT.) I'll have to borrow your outboard to get back to shore. \nMUFFY We keep all the keys on the board in the kitchen, but I think there's an extra one underneath the cushion there. She points to the boat seat. Potter is much obliged. \nEXT. ROAD - DAY \nCONSTABLE POTTER (to the others, sternly) I'm glad you're stuck here, all o' you. If there's anvthin' else, or anything happens to Buck... I want to know where to find you. \nThe van moves slowly along a narrow road through the forest. From what we can see of its occupants, the mood is pretty grim. Behind it, the old island pick-up truck follows. \nINT. PICK-UP \nRob drives with Kit and Skip beside him in the cab. Nobody says anything . Skip is off somewhere in his own private hell. Finally he reaches over to roll down his window, but the handle rotates uselessly in his grip. \nSKIP These goddamn windows! \nHe starts banging violently on the door, on the window. \nSKIP They've never been fixed... \nKIT Look, Skip, it wasn't your fault. It was an accident. You didn't know. \nSKIP (BITTER) Sure. \nHe leaves off his banging. Pause. \nROB (SIGHS) What a way to start a weekend, huh. \nSKIP Muffy. Nothing bad ever happens to her. \nEXT. ST. JOHN HOUSE. DAY. \nIt is a truly grand affair, two stories at least, rambling and picture-perfect with extensive tended grounds, garage, and outbuildings. Muffy gets out first, hopping around to the back to open the rear van gate for the bags. Nan beholds the house for the first time. NAN (OVERWHELMED) Oh; Muffy... \nRob pulls the pick-up right behind them. \nINT. ENTRY HALL - DAY \nAs they come in with their bags. \nMUFFY Well, there's an awful lot to be done with this place. \nARCH You sound as if you own it. \nShe helps with bags, shepherding them on ahead. \nMUFFY I will, if all goes well. Next month when I turn 21. It's my first- stage inheritance. \nHARVEY (AMAZED) First stage? What's your second? \nNIKKI (DRYLY) Texas. You might be talking to your future boss, Harve. \nCHAZ Mom, I am home! \nThey all look to see him standing in the entrance to the living room. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \n", "test1_true": "ARCH Yeah, I could get real used to this. \nMUFFY We used to spend our summers here before my mother died. (BEAT) This is a very special place to me. \nNAN It's like a dream. NIKKI On a clear day you can see the Kennedys. \nCHAZ'S VOICE (from the dining room) Wow, look at this...! \nINT. DINING ROOM \nThe others enter to see what Chaz's shout is all about. \nChaz stands before a large, beautifully polished dining table that is set for each of them -- each place carefully marked with a name card and a Ken or Barbie doll with the person's name on it. The settings themselves are idiomatic and economical -- plastic spoon-and-fork combination sets and paper cups, plates, napkins, etc., \nCHAZ (in mock awe) Look! Our very own place settings... with our very own place cards -- with Ken or Barbie! Outasight! \nNAN (GIGGLES) Just like in Agatha Cristie. \nARCH (in the spirit) And sporks... \nHARVEY (QUIETLY) Sporks? \nARCH And napkins with little Hallmark bunnies! Gee, Muff, you really spared no expense. \nMUFFY (ENTERING JAUNTILY) Why not? How do you think father made all his money? \nNIKKI (ENTERING) The old-fashioned way. He inherited it. \nNAN (meaningfully, with her Barbie) I used to have all her outfits. \nCHAZ Don't anybody move! Chaz jumps back from the table, whipping out his videocam to record the moment, and panning them all at \u00b7 .their respective places. \nCHAZ (CONT) One of us in this room... (bellowing a mystery laugh) ...pulls his wang. \nHe ends the pan on Arch, who gives him the finger. \nINT. KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON \nCLOSE UP - A HOT DOG \ndropping onto a hot skillet . \nWIDEN TO REVEAL \nMuffy, Nikki and Kit cooking a dinner of hot dogs... baked. \nNIKKI ...if only the choices weren't so limited. God, I'm so ready for a change. Any kind of change. \nMUFFY Well, you know, everything they say about older men? It's true. \nKit and Nikki stare at her, open-mouthed. \nKIT Muffy! \nNIKKI Like how much older are we talking about? Twenty-six? \nMUFFY Add about thirty years. \nNIKKI I don't believe \u00b7you, St. John! \nKIT (TURNING AWAY) I don't want to hear about this. \nNIKKI Come on! \u00b7 MUFFY It was only a weekend. It's over now. (beat, shrugs) I was curious. \nKIT He wasn't married? \nMUFFY (BLITHELY) How should I know? \nKit and Nikki just drop everything and continue to stare at her . \nMUFFY It was quite a weekend. \nNikki starts to laugh. \nNIKKI Come to daddy. \nThey all start to laugh now, wickedly, conspiratorially. \n", "test2_input": "Rob steps forward and lifts the painting off the wall. Behind it is an inset bookcase. Sitting on one of the shelves, at the proper height to have lined up with the holes in the portrait, is a child's Felix-the- cat nursery clock.

UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT \nRob sets the painting on the floor outside their bedroom door, leaning it up against the wall. \nCAMERA DOLLIES IN for a CLOSE UP of the portrait. It looks much creepier with the now vacant eye sockets. \nINT. ROB AND KIT'S ROOM - NIGHT \nThey are undressing on opposite sides of the bed. The silence between them is thick enough to be cut with a knife. Kit sits down slowly on the edge of the bed and quietly slips under the covers. Rob gets in on his side. \nThey sit in silence for a moment, making no move to join each other in the middle of the bed. \nKIT Rob? \nNo answer. \nKIT You still angry with me? About dinner? \nROB No. I'm sorry. I'm not angry with you. I'm just angry. \nHe leans over, turns off the bedside lamp... and the light in the bathroom comes on. Beat. \nHe gets out of bed and crosses to the bathroom, reaches in and turns off the light... ...and the overhead light comes on. Kit starts to laugh and quickly covers her mouth. Rob walks to the door, turns off the overhead light... \n...and the bedside lamp comes on again. Kit laughs harder, but still tries to stifle it. \nRob shoots her a look, then goes and sits on the edge of the bed. He reaches to turn off the bedside lamp again, then thinks better of it and starts to unscrew the bulb instead. \nROB (burning his fingers) Ouch! Jesus! \nKit can't stop herself any longer. She laughs out loud. Rob perseveres, finally unscrewing the bulb enough to plunge the room into darkness. \nSilence. \nROB Very funny. \nKit breaks up laughing again. To her it is funny. And soon Rob is laughing too. He swings his legs up under the covers beside her. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nMuffy turns off the last of the lights downstairs, leaving the porch light on for Skip. \nINT. UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT \nMuffy moves through the quiet to her room. Arch grabs her. She jumps. \nMUFFY (COLLECTS HERSELF) Arch do you know what time it is? \nARCH Um-hmm. \nMUFFY (turning down his collar) Goodnight, Arch. \nGently but firmly, she extricates herself, closing the bedroom door behind her. ARCH \nUndaunted, he scuttles down the hall to Rob and Kit's closed door to listen in. He frowns, the slides farther down to Nikki's room, knocks once softly, and enters. \nHIS POV \nNikki is already occupied, however, with Chaz. She catches Arch's stare, signalling him to get the hell out. \nREVERSE \nArch valorously steps back, closing the door and returning to try Nan. \nThe light underneath her door flicks off, however. The door is also locked. \nArch curses, returning to his large but empty room. He slams the door for everybody's benefit. \nINT. MUFFY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nMuffy, undressing, hears, and smiles. \nINT. ARCH'S ROOM - NIGHT Arch is pacing the bedroom, horny and alone. He gets an idea, goes and rummages through Chaz' stuff and comes up with a video cassette of a porno movie. \nCarrying -the cassette he crosses to the door and turns the handle. The doorknob comes off in his hand. \nHe throws it down in disgust, goes and sits in a chair and broods. The chair collapses beneath him. \n", "test2_true": "Skip makes his way boldly, carelessly, drunkenly along. Overgrown weeds and tall spring grass choke the path, shadowing his way. He takes one last drink, killing the bottle, and hurls it out into the night. \nAfter a long pause there is the distant sound O.S. of the bottle landing in water with a splash. \nEXT. OLD , BOATHOUSE - NIGHT \nSkip emerges from the overgrowth. The abandoned old structure and its dock squat ahead at water's edge. Beneath the boathouse, floating in the water, is a grungy old skiff covered by a tarp. Skip turns away from the dock, and flicks his lighter among the weeds, finding marijuana growing there. He CACKLES with triumph. \nSomething MOVES nearby. He doesn't pay attention, taking out his knife to cull the dried leaves. He cups them in his hand against the wind, douses his lighter, and hurries out onto the dock to the boathouse entrance to prepare his joint. \nINT. BOATHOUSE - NIGHT \nas Skip enters. It is pitch black in here, and aside from the gentle lapping sounds of water against the pilings down below O.S., all is still. \nSkip flips a lightswitch in the darkness and nothing happens. He edges slowly along a wall away from the door. Then he becomes aware of another living presence in the boathouse. It is a slow breathing sound--completely inhuman. \nSKIP Hello? \nThere is no answer, but the breathing continues. Then a sharp rapping sound very near, like a foot striking the wood flooring. \nSKIP Who's there? \nPause. No answer. We hear in the darkness the sound of his switchblade clicking open. And then he waits, straining his ears to hear. \nFinally, Skip reaches into his pocket, puils out his lighter and flicks it on. \nSomething snags him from behind. \nSkip gasps, helpless, as a thick rope controlled by powerful, shadowed hands tightens around his neck. \nHis knife, dried leaves and lighter cascade to the floor. \nEXT. ST. JOHN HOUSE - NIGHT - LATER \nOnly the porch light remains glowing. The house is dark. \nINT. ROB AND KIT'S ROOM - NIGHT \nRob wakes, hearing the CRY from Muff's room. Kit, naked against him, wakes too. They hear the muffled cry again. It is not from lovemaking. Rob throws off the covers. INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT \nRob wraps himself with a towel, stepping quickly out to Muffy's door. Everything else is dark and quiet. \nROB (hushed, at door) Muffy? \nNo answer. He tries her door, but it's locked tight. \nA beat. Then: \nROB (cont.) (CONCERNED) Muffy? \nMUFFY'S VOICE (UNCERTAINLY) Yes? \nROB You OK? \nMUFFY'S VOICE (DISTANTLY) Yes... Thank you... \nHe pulls back from the door. \nROB (reluctantly, puzzled) OK... well, goodnight... \nNo response. He turns back for his room, catching sight of Chaz, who has come out of Nikki's room, to investigate, too. \nEXT. HOUSE - MORNING \nHarvey is out on the second floor balcony exercising vigorously. No one else is in evidence until a bedroom window flies open and Nikki, naked from the waist up and believing herself unwatched, leans out and stretches, breathing in the sweet morning air. \nThen she sees Harvey grinning at her. She quickly covers herself and pulls back inside. INT. KITCHEN \u00ad DAY \nRob and Kit are the first ones down. They enter from the dining room, surprising Muffy at the stove. \nKIT (BRISKLY) Good morning! \nMuffy turns abruptly, startled. Rob and Kit stop abruptly, too. \nANGLE \nMuffy is barefooted, dressed in an old, worn chenille robe. Her hair, normally carefully groomed, is unkempt, wild and stringy about her pale face. Talk about unguarded moments. Her present appearance, is the last way one would ever expect to find Muffy St. John. \n", "test3_input": "RETURN ANGLE \nShe shrinks back from them with a frightened, apologetic smile. Scrambled eggs bubble in the skillet on the burner. \nMUFFY I... I was hungry... \nShe bumps against the stove, backing away. She self-consciously runs a hand through her hair. \nMUFFY (cont.) I... I must look a mess... \nShe scuttles out the door to the utility room and the back stairs beyond, leaving the eggs to burn. \nINT. BACK STAIRS \u00ad DAY \nArch encounters her, too, as he comes bounding down in his workout shorts. \nARCH Morning! She backs away from him, scurrying up the stairs. \nMUFFY I... forgot to get dressed... \nINT. KITCHEN - DAY \nArch enters, joining his wonderment to Rob and Kit's. ARCH Who made her night? \nEXT. BACK PORCH - DAY - LATER \nCUT TO: \nArch, Chaz, Harvey and Nikki burst out the door in old clothes, sweats, shorts, whatever -- an unlikely foursome for some informal soccer scrimmaging. \nARCH (always in search of more players) Where's Skip? \nCHAZ That depends on what he's on. \nRob and Kit cross their path, heading down to the water in their swimsuits and overshirts. \nNIKKI You gotta be kidding... \nARCH (teasingly, an invitation) Nan? What about it? \nNan watches from the porch, book in hand. \nNAN Oh, no, thanks. (FALSELY) Besides, I thought I'd wait and see what Muffy wanted to do... \nArch shrugs and the soccer free-for-all begins in earnest, with special attention given to the interplay between Harvey and Nikki. \nUp on the porch, Nan finally sees Muffy emerging from the distant tool shed. Muffy is dressed plainly, oddly conventional, with a perceptible sense of disorder about her. She keeps to herself, turning toward the woods beyond, with cutting blade and mushroom basket in hand. \nNan puts down her book, hurrying off the porch. But by the timeshe looks up again, Muffy is gone... EXT. DOCK - DAY \nRob and Kit are standing together on the dock. He is dripping wet and covered with goose flesh. She has not been in yet. And while he is vigorously toweling off his arms and chest, trying to get the blood circulating again, she stands behind him with another towel and gently, lovingly dries his back. She finishes and he steps away from her and gazes out across the sound. \nKIT Rob? What's wrong? \nPause. \nROB I swear it wasn't this cold yesterday . \nThis isn't what she meant, and he knows it. \nKIT Are you giving up? \nROB (turning to her; gently) What about you? What about your future? You're the one with the four point. (DEJECTED) ...maybe it's crazy--you investing so much energy in me. \nKIT (QUIETLY) I don't know. I'm scared. I don't know if I want what Mom and everybody else expects of me. I don't want to go to law school. \nROB (PROTESTING) You've got a great mind \nKIT ...only it's not made up. \nSmiling sadly, he crosses to her, puts his arms around her. \nROB Great... Do you realize how perfectly unmatched we are? \nKIT It's made up about one thing though. \nROB Yeah? What's that? She looks up and kisses him softly. \nROB Will you feel the same about me a year from now? Two years, five years from now? \n", "test3_true": "INT. BOATHOUSE - DAY As they come inside. Kit closes the door, and immediately they are in each other's arms. \nThe surging waves swirl beneath them, visible through the shrunken floorboards. Rob and Kit stretch out. All the passion, all the tenderness, all the intensity makes them oblivious to the fact that something is moving on the water below... \nAnd when Kit finally opens her eyes to it, Skip's face bulges gruesomely up at her through the slatted floor! \nKit screams and scrambles to her feet--Rob completely uncomprehending until he sees it too: Skip's body, pale and bloodied, draped within the grungy skiff passing beneath them on the waves. \nEXT. DOCK - DAY \nBy the time he pulls on his swimsuit and comes rushing out with Kit, however, Rob's shock has turned to rage. \nROB Skip! You sonofabitch! \nBut there's no response, Skip's body unmoving on the self-powered skiff which continues bobbing out to sea. \nROB \nstarts to wonder whether it really is a joke. He hurries forward, plunging 'into the water to reach the boat. \nROB Skip... Skip! \nBut it's too far and getting farther, and the waves are too strong. \nEXT. ST. JOHN HOUSE - DAY \nRob and Kit come struggling up the path. Chaz trains his videopak on them from the porch . He, Arch, Harvey and Nikki unwind with beer and sandwiches after their sweaty workout. CHAZ (commentary while he tapes) Respectable young Quaker couple returning after quiet afternoon of nonviolent sex. \nARCH (CALLING ) Well, how was it? \nROB Where's Skip? Anybody seen him? \nNIKKI Who wants to know? \nROB Goddammit, can't you give me a straight answer! \nThey sit up with the force. Nan comes out on the porch, hearing . \nKIT (FRANTICALLY) We saw him... on a boat... drifting by the pier. He wasn't movinq. He looked dead... unless he was joking...! \nCHAZ Well, if it was Skip... \nKIT I saw his face! \nROB (DEMANDINGLY) Has anybody seen him since last night? \nThey all realize they haven't. \nROB (cont .) Jesus Christ... \nRob turns, rushing into the house. \nINT. ENTRY HALL - DAY \nRob stops as he notices, near the foot of the stairs where he'd parked it upon first entering the house yesterday afternoon, Skip's overnight bag. \nHe turns and bounds up the stairs. INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY \nRob runs down to Skip's door and flings it open. A cheap rubber hobgoblin drops suddenly in front of him, suspended from the ceiling on frail, metal springs. \nRob jumps back with a startled cry, then angrily tears the thing out of his way and throws it down. \nThis is the last of Muffy's little April Fool's gags, and as with the overnight bag, it signifies that Skip has been nowhere near this room. \nBut Rob steps inside and looks around just to make sure. \nThe room is untouched, the bed unslept in. \nEXT . PORCH - DAY \nRob hurries out, as Muffy finally appears, emerging from the wooded grounds, basketful of mushrooms in hand. She approaches. \nMUFFY (noticing their distress ) Something wrong? \nRob rushes by her. \nARCH Wait! I'll go with you! \n"}

DRUMMOND To insure one full hour of uninterrupted privacy. 
BOCK Oh yes. 
DRUMMOND I got up, wheeled Miss Campanella off to the operating rooms, replaced her bed with Mrs. Mangafranni's, exchanged charts and identity bracelets. She died officially of anesthesia shock. But, in point of fact, she died because she was wearing another woman's identity. 
BARBARA (to Bock) God, what do we do now? Let me take him back to Mexico. It's a simple world there. If you turn him in, they'll just cage him in the Rockland State Hospital for the Criminally Insane. Let me take him back, Herb. 
BOCK Are you kidding? We'll both take him. I'm going with you! Get him dressed. We're getting out of here before the police put us all in Rockland State. 
DRUMMOND I haven't finished my work here. I have this Welbeck to dispose of. I am the angel of the bottomless pit and the wrath of the lamb. 
BARBARA Oh dear, he's having another revelation. 
Bock holds Drummond's coat and hat and crosses to take his arm. He finds the entranced Drummond as rigid as a statue. 
BOCK Look, that ambulance must be here by now. You go down and get them. I'll give him a shot of something to knock him out. We'll take him to the airport in the ambulance. 
They both hurry out of the room. Drummond remains enmarbled in his trance. CAMERA SUDDENLY MOVES DOWN to William Mead, whose eyes now open; he has heard it all. In background, Drummond, suddenly released from his catatonic trance, heads for the armoire and extracts the white trousers of Dr. Schaefer's uniform. He puts them on, tucking in the tails of his hospital shift. He notices William Mead staring at him. 
DRUMMOND You're hallucinating again. 
William Mead just stares at Drummond. 
EIGHTH FLOOR, NURSES' STATION AND LOBBY AREA 
Bock and Barbara come hurrying around the corner from the west corridor. Barbara heads for the elevators. Bock heads for the Nurses' Station. The Eighth Floor is going about its normal 1:15 P.M. activity. Mrs. Donovan is at her desk on the phone. 
MRS. DONOVAN ...Edwards never showed up. I'm short- staffed as hell. It's just me and Felicia. It's like Sunday. Nobody's here. 
DR. BIEGELMAN I'll be at lunch... 
A nurse's aid, a bathrobed patient and two of his visitors stroll by. It's the end of the lunch hour, when the kitchen workers bring used trays back. 
MRS. DONOVAN Yeah, you gotta send me somebody... Oh yeah? 
Bock moves past Mrs. Donovan and into the pharmacy where we see him scouring the shelves for thorazine and a syringe. An elevator arrives, disgorging Milton Mead and his resident assistant, Thomas Hitchcock and, of all people, Dr. Richard Welbeck himself. Barbara and Dr. Biegelman go into the elevator. The doors close. Milton Mead and Hitchcock head for the west corridor. Welbeck, in his natty double-breasted suit and carrying his cashmere coat, heads straight for the Nurses' Station. 
MEAD We'll be in Eight-O-Six. 
MRS. DONOVAN (chuckles into phone) ...then what did she say? 
WELBECK (to Mrs. Donovan) I'm Dr. Welbeck. I have a patient on this floor named Drummond, and I'd like to see his chart. 
MRS. DONOVAN I'll call you back. 
Bock immediately emerges from the pharmacy holding a bottle of thorazine and a wrapped hypodermic syringe. He scowls at Welbeck, who scowls back. 
WELBECK Oh, Dr. Bock. Can I have a few minutes of your time, sir? 
BOCK No. 
He starts to pass Mrs. Donovan and would continue, but Welbeck lays a restraining hand on his arm. 
WELBECK Dr. Gilley tells me you're the one who initiated these proceedings against me. 
BOCK I'm busy, Welbeck. 
WELBECK I'd like to know what you have against me. 
BOCK You turned up half-stoned for a simple nephrectomy eight days ago, botched it, put the patient into failure and damn near killed him. Then, pausing only to send in your bill, you flew off on the wings of man to an island of sun in Montego Bay. This is the third time in two years we've had to patch up your patients; the other two died. You're greedy, unfeeling, inept, indifferent, self-inflating and unconscionably profitable. Aside from that, I have nothing against you. I'm sure you play a hell of a game of golf. What else do you want to know? 
Welbeck's pocket-beeper BEEPS.

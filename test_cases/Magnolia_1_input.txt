ARTHUR BARRINGER Why would I load the gun? 
CUT TO: 
INT. APARTMENT/HALLWAY - THAT MOMENT 
CAMERA moves through as OFFICERS are talking to and getting statements from VARIOUS NEIGHBORS...CAMERA closes in on an EIGHT YEAR OLD BOY, speaking with a DETECTIVE. 
NARRATOR A young boy who lived in the building, sometimes a vistor and friend to Sydney Barringer said that he had seen, six days prior the loading of the shotgun -- 
The DETECTIVE turns his head and calls to another -- 
DETECTIVE C'mere a minute -- 
CUT TO: 
INT. APARTMENT - DAY - FLASHBACK. 
CAMERA moves into a bedroom area where we see a FIGURE from the back sitting on the bed -- 
NARRATOR It seems that the arguing and the fighting and all of the violence was far too much for Sydney Barringer and knowing his mother and father's tendency to fight, he decided to do something -- 
CAMERA reveals that it is Sydney Barringer who is loading the shotgun. The YOUNG BOY is sitting nearby, watching Sydney mumble to himself as he loads shells into the shotgun. 
CUT TO: 
INT. APARTMENT/HALLWAY - PRESENT 
CAMERA moves in on the YOUNG BOY, who looks INTO CAMERA.

CUT TO: 
EXT. BUILDING/ROOFTOP - DAY - FLASHBACK 
This is a WIDE ANGLE REPLAY of the whole event.  We see the whole bui1ding...Sydney starts to jump and the film suddenly slows down... 
A diagram is made to reflect the narration...this is done like NFL coverage where the x's and o's and arrows and lines are drawn to indicate placement and moves, etc.) 
An x appears on the top of the building over Sydney. 
NARRATOR Sydney Barringer jumps from the ninth floor rooftop -- His parents argue three stories below -- 
An o is marked to indicate their position. Image goes into MOTION with Sydney jumping...an ARROW is drawn that displays the PATH of his fall -- 
NARRATOR Her accidental shotgun blast hits Sydney in the stomach as he passes the arguing sixth floor window -- 
Freeze Frame shows Sydney, hanging mid-air -- the glass shattering and starting to fall to the ground -- an X marks the spot where he is hit. 
NARRATOR He is killed instantly but continues to fall -- only to find, three stories below -- a safety net installed three days prior for a set of window washers that would have broken his fall and saved his life if not for the hole in his stomach. 
A squiggly line with an arrow is drawn from Sydney to the net to indicate the path -- UNFREEZE frame and watch Sydney fall into the net 
CUT TO: 
INT. APARTMENT - DAY 
CAMERA moves in on the PARENTS then over to some DETECTIVES and OFFICERS who are making sense of this, they nod to each other as if to say, "well we know what we have to do..." 
NARRATOR So Fay Barringer was charged with the murder of her son and Sydney Barringer noted as an accomplice in his own death... 
CAMERA moves towards the little EIGHT YEAR OLD BOY as he watches the older couple CRY and SCREAM as detectives begin to cuff them -- 
NARRATOR ...and it is in the humble opinion of this narrator that this is not just "Something That Happened."  This cannot be "One of those things..." This, please, cannot be that. And for what I would like to say, I can't. This Was Not Just A Matter Of Chance. 
CAMERA pushes in towards the MOTHER as she screams and screams and the officer's fight to regain control of her -- in the scuffle, the apartment door is shut directly in the face of the CAMERA. 
CUT TO BLACK. 
NARRATOR Ohhhh. These strange things happen all the time.

THE CURATOR And a magician is just an actor playing the part of a magician.   My compliments. 
Bloom takes Penelope gently by the elbow and guides her up and away. 
74   EXT. BOW - NIGHT                                             74 
They stroll out onto the moonlit bow of the ship. 
PENELOPE Who is that man? You avoided him earlier on the deck. 
BLOOM I don't know, but he's carrying a knife up his sleeve and wearing a cape. Do me a favor and steer clear of him. 
A waltz drifts through the air from a band unseen. 
BLOOM (CONT'D) (cont'd) I don't suppose in all your hobby acquiring you ever learned how to dance? 
PENELOPE I went through a phase when I was mildly obsessed with the Bolero. 
BLOOM Give me a minute. 
He leaves her alone. Clouds obscure the moon, shadows deepen. She shivers. 
A match strikes.   She jumps. 
The moon re-emerges, and she is no longer alone on the deck. The Curator lights a dapper briar pipe, shakes out the match. 
THE CURATOR Mademoiselle. 
PENELOPE Monsieur. 
THE CURATOR (in French, subtitled) I didn't mean to startle you. 
PENELOPE (in French, subtitled) Yes you did. 
74   CONTINUED:                                                 74 
THE CURATOR (in French, subtitled) Apologies, but the deck was dark, and I had to approach. (English) It's been such a time since I've encountered the Brothers Bloom. 
PENELOPE You're in antiques? 
THE CURATOR (Cheshire grin) Antiques. I wonder, my dear, if you know the true nature of the men you travel with? 
The band strikes up a Bolero. The Curator flicks his wrist, and a long thin blade falls into his hand. 
THE CURATOR (cont'd) A little fear might suit you, I think. 
He raises the blade... it is in fact a fine mustache brush, which he delicately employs. 
THE CURATOR (cont'd) Bon soir, ma cherie. 
With that the Curator backs into the shadows, and is gone. Moments later Bloom trots up to her, oblivious. 
BLOOM It isn't a Spanish band, but they'll do their best. 
He hands her a single blood red rose. She puts it in her teeth, and they dance. If there is a tinge of tension in the air, the Bolero suits it. 
The moon ducks behind a cloud once more, and they dance on in the dark. 
75   INT. STATE ROOM - MORNING                                    75 
Bloom wakes with a start. Morning light pours in through his porthole. He opens it, looks out to sea. 
75   CONTINUED:                                                75 
His dinner jacket draped over a chair. The rose in its lapel. He fishes it out. Runs his fingers over the teeth marks on the stem. 
Then raises an eyebrow at a lump in the breast pocket, and pulls out the stack of bills in the green rubber band. 
76   EXT. DECK - MORNING                                          76 
The Chink and Penelope lie on their stomachs on the deck, a beer can pinhole camera between them. 
Penelope gives a lesson on how it works. 
The Chink appreciates her. 
77   EXT. BREAKFAST DECK - LATER                                  77 
Bloom escorts Penelope to breakfast. 
PENELOPE How'd you find her? 
BLOOM The Chi-nese, uh, Yeungling?   She found us. 
78   INT. KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING (FLASHBACK)                     78 
Bloom cooks breakfast in his bathrobe. 
BLOOM (O.S.) A few years back, when we hit the top of our art dealing game, she just appeared. 
A door opens and slams. Bloom turns. The Chink sits at his place at the table, suitcase beside her, smoking a cigarette. 
BLOOM (O.S.) (cont'd) She's stuck with us. We figure when she gets bored she'll vanish with the same lack of noise. 
Like feeding a strange animal, Bloom pours her coffee.   She drinks it without looking at him. 
79   EXT. BREAKFAST DECK                                          79

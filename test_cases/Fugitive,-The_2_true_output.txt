RENFRO 
Separated from Gerard. He hears a NOISE behind him - a bag comes down the track at break-neck speed, Renfro spins, dodges it, gets his bearings and continues. 
KIMBLE 
Listening. He watches the movement of bags as he did with Nichols. 
GERARD 
Moving through the forest of massive bags. 
GERARD ... That's why there was no forced entry at your house. He'd used your keys. 
KIMBLE 
Realizing what Gerard knows. Considering his next move. 
NICHOLS 
Also listening. He realizes Gerard now knows he's the killer. He moves behind the water softener tanks and chemicals - and spots Renfro - and something else -the hanging control for the I-beam. 
GERARD 
Moves carefully. Another bag comes down the track. He dodges it and steps into an open track. From here he can see straight back toward the washers. 
GERARD Kimble... Come meet me out here. 
ON RENFRO 
He steps out and then back as a bag shoots by. He ducks under the bag - into the next track and suddenly hears a WHIRRING sound behind him. Renfro turns as an I-beam comes rushing down the open track and knocks him to the floor, opening a gash across the side of his head. He lays still. 
NICHOLS 
Steps out of the shadows, turns him over exposing his empty shoulder harness and takes the gun from Renfro's hand. Nichols moves toward Gerard with the gun. 
GERARD 
Oblivious to this action, moves on, passes the conveyor belts. He makes one last appeal. 
GERARD It's time to quit running... if you don't, you know I'll stop you. He listens, there is no answer. 
KIMBLE 
Starts to move out to meet Gerard, sees Renfro down. His shoulder harness is empty. He knows Nichols is armed. 
GERARD 
Moves into the alley between the two giant washers. He pauses, looks back, then continues, when he turns his back on us... 
NICHOLS 
Steps INTO FRAME behind him and slowly takes aim. Just before he fires however he hears... 
KIMBLE (O.S.) Hey, Chuckles... 
Nichols turns toward the voice as Kimble swings the stick and clocks him - sending the gun skittering on the floor behind Gerard. 
GERARD 
Turns on the sound and finds his gun trained on Kimble with Nichols at his feet, unconscious. He realizes instantly that Kimble saved his life and lowers his gun. 
Kimble, exhausted, leans against the washer. 
They hold a look as deputies and police flood into the room surrounding Kimble and handcuffing him. 
INT. / EXT. HILTON HOTEL - NIGHT (LATER) 
Chicago Police hold back crowds of onlookers on Michigan Avenue. Police cars and vans, television news trucks vie for space in front of the Hilton Towers. 
Dr. Charles Nichols, on a stretcher, loaded into an ambulance. The doors close. 
REPORTERS and television cameramen line the sidewalk giving reports and interviewing doctors from the ballroom. We PICK UP pieces of their reports as we MOVE PAST them TOWARD the entrance. 
T.V. NEWS REPORTER ... As we reported a few minutes ago, the saga of once-prominent Chicago surgeon, Dr. Richard Kimble, who escaped from an Illinois Corrections bus, took a strange twist this evening when Dr. Kimble was captured at the Chicago Hilton... 
ANOTHER REPORTER continues:

The doors to the police van close amid a flurry of photographs. 
A third reporter interviews a STUNNED DOCTOR from the ballroom:

CUT TO: 
INT. HOTEL - NIGHT 
Kimble, in handcuffs, is escorted by Biggs, Newman, Poole and Gerard, out of the hotel into the waiting chaos. Renfro, his head bandaged, is helped by paramedics. 
EXT. HOTEL / INT. CAR - NIGHT 
As soon as the group exits the hotel. Television lights flood the scene. Kimble lowers his head. Reporters crowd forward, yelling questions. 
REPORTER Dr. Kimble, is it true you can prove your innocence! 
Gerard wants the crowd controlled. 
GERARD (to police) Get them back. 
The marshals ant cops clear a line for Kimble to get into a waiting car away from the media. Biggs opens the back door and helps Kimble inside. 
BIGGS Watch your head, Dr. Kimble. 
Newman climbs in behind the wheel. Gerard in the back next to Kimble. He leans out the window and motions to Poole. 
GERARD (to Poole) Poole, you got that thing? (to Kimble) Give me your hands. 
Kimble pauses, then holds up his wrists and Gerard unlocks Kimble's handcuffs.

DRIVER (indicated Billy) He's a tourist, what do you want, he says he's looking for friends at the campground. 
FIRST POLICEMAN glances BILLY 
POLICEMAN Campground? (shrugs) Never heard of one. 
DRIVER Seen any Swedish foreigners in a camper-bus? 
SECOND POLICEMAN meanwhile eases his arm down on the OPEN WINDOW bringing BILLY into foreground. The COP'S mouth is open and exhaling a wave of beer breath over-BILLY. 
BILLY P.O.V. - BEER FACE FOCUS PAST him to SOLDIER at tank reading "Hurriyet" - the picture of BILLY on page one, spread for all to see. 
BEER FACE Noldu? 
DRIVER turning around to address him. 
DRIVER Seen any foreigners in a camper bus? 
SOLDIER circles the cab from the other side. 
BILLY motions to the DRIVER. 
BILLY Okay, they haven't seen him, let's go back to town, it's getting late. 
THE DRIVER ignores it. Calls out again, louder to BEER FACE. 
DRIVER Foreigners!  KAMPER.  VOLKSWAGEN 
BILLY rigid. This asshole of a driver! 
BEER FACE glances at BILLY, pulls his head out the window. 
Looks down the road. Takes a sip of beer. 
SOLDIER, disinterested, moves back towards the tank. 
BEER FACE looks in the other direction down the road, burps.Very conscious of his authority, shakes his head without looking at the driver.  Moves away. 
BILLY nudges the DRIVER. 
BILLY Okay, let's go. 
THE DRIVER impatiently turns and looks straight at BILLY, aware of his anxiety. 
DRIVER Is no Volkswagen, man! Something wrong with you? 
BILLY hardening. 
DRIVER calling out. 
BEER FACE turns. 
DRIVER leans out the window. 
DRIVER This guy's fishy...I think he might be trying to get to Greece. 
BILLY looks around fast. 
BEER FACE starts back lazily, half drunk, with the OTHER POLICEMAN 
BEER FACE Huh? 
DRIVER 
DRIVER I don't know, there's 
His eyes grow big suddenly As he sees the barrel of Hamidou's REVOLVER right in His cheek. 
BILLY all business, very quiet. 
BILLY Get out -- right now, move! 
BEER-FACE advancing looks puzzled, thinks he sees something, then crouches as: 
DRIVER gets out the door crouching, yells. 
DRIVER He's got a gun! 
BILLY firing SHOTS off to distract them has climbed over the front seat, jams the cab into gear. It stalls! Again he tries, and now shoots off. 
THE CAB Roars past the roadblock. 
THE COPS AND SOLDIER, scattered by the shots, now scream at each other. They run.  SHOTS are fired. 
BILLY guns the cab down the road, flying. 
CLOUDS OF DUST trail the cab.

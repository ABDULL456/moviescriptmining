{"test1_input": "JIM (to Ray, innocently) Jesus Ray, every girl out there wanted to fuck me, I could feel it for the first time! \nRAY Right on stud. But you better watch out for the guys. \nJIM (to the band) Guys, I'm serious about the desert, we still gotta deepen man, we gotta take some peyote -- all of us together, we got one more stage to go... \nROBBIE I don't know man, fucks up my playing. I been playing music for 10 years man and this is the first time in my whole damned life I ever played it. \nJIM Are you satisfied? \nJOHN Will you get off my case! I'm never doing acid again. Too many bad trips man. \nJIM It's not acid John, it's peyote. It's a bonding ceremony. It's got to be more... more... more... \nJOHN I'm into TM man. I promised my guru... \nPAM I want to! I want to! I'm ready. Let's go to the desert... do the peyote, the good peyote. \nJIM (to girl in line) Who's on now? \nGIRL 1 (withering look, very hip) \"Love\". \nJIM Yeah, Arthur Lee's cool. \nGIRL 1 They're the best... better'n the Beatles. \nJIM You mean the Marx Brothers of music, we could blow 'em away. \nThe GIRLS looking at each other like who is this jerk. \nGIRL 2 And who are you? \nJIM The Doors... We're up the street at the Fog. \nLaughter from the GIRLS. \nGIRL 1 (contempt) The Doors. I heard of you. That's the dumbest name. I wouldn't go to the Fog if you paid me. \nJIM Oh yeah what would you do for money? \nPAM Let's go Jim, come on. \nMeanwhile DENSMORE is hitting up on GIRL 2. \nJOHN So you don't have a phone number? What do you mean you don't have a phone number? \nGIRL 2 I don't have a phone number. So give me your number then. \nJOHN I don't have a phone. \nRobbie is doing his imitation of a shrimp for ANOTHER GIRL who's laughing. \nGIRL 1 (intrigued, to Jim) Well, would you leave my name at the door? \nJIM Well I don't know. What's your name? \nGIRL 1 Caprice. \nJIM Caprice? That's the dumbest name I ever heard. \nA look between Jim and Caprice. Pamela pulling Jim away, gives the girl a look. \nJIM Hey! I am the Lizard king. I can do Anything! Raise your hands if you understand! Alive, any of you alive -- let's take a poll -- how many of you know you're really alive!! \nThe crowd giggles. Jim climbs a pole, yells. \nJIM No one? Raise your hands c'mon man... let's go. \nOn the crowd. A few raise their hands, smile. \nWe IRIS in on the Doors suddenly -- a strange sound -- REVERSE IRIS on Jim -- feeling it now. The peyote. \nJIM's POV -- Pam irising out. This strange sound in his ears -- a rattle of an Indian gourd, similar to what we heard in the car in Arizona when Jim was a boy. Now a distant Indian drum beating. The beginning strains of THE END dribble in. \nEXT. DESERT - DAY \nA dented RED CHEVROLET fishtails on a dry mudflat, whipping up dustdevils. \nThey're all LAUGHING (strange noise) -- in a circle somewhere on the edge of a precipice in deep arroyos and magnificent rocks and cacti... \nA football huddle of faces - RAY, JOHN, ROBBIE, JIM -- the four DOORS... laughing with the first mad impulse of the peyote. \nPAM is vomiting her brains out as DOROTHY tries to comfort her on the edge of a cliff... Jim panthers up the dune. \nJIM Everybody having a good time? \nThey hug. She throws up again. \nJIM ...awright, pretty good, it gets better. \nJim holds his head. Feels the ride. \nJIM WOA!! It's fast. \nJUMP CUTS: Jim and Pam are touching each other. Face. Shadows. Sand falls from Pam's hand. Jim turns to hawk at a bird. \"Hawk! Hawk!\" Then Pam is dancing alone on the dune. \nAbruptly Jim is back in the circle with the Doors in a sense torn between them and Pam. EXTREME CLOSEUPS of their faces, their eyes, the tensions of the trip tearing apart their teeth as they go from the laughing to the dangerous part. \nJIM When the serpent appears, his head is ten feet long and five feet wide. He has one red eye and one green eye. He's deadly and he's seven miles long. As he moves -- on his scales is written all the history of the world, all people, all actions, all of us our little pictures on the scales, God it's big! -- and it's eating as it moves all the time, devouring, digesting consciousness, power, a monster of energy! \n", "test1_true": "JIM We must kiss the snake on the tongue, if it senses our fear, it will eat us instantly. But if we kiss it without fear, the snake will take us through the garden and out the gate. To our freedom -we must ride this snake. To the end of time. \nPause. He has instilled a flux of fear in the group. \nJOHN I think I'm fucked up. I'm not thinking right. \nJIM You're fucked up John. Go with it, confusion is the sound of creation. \nJOHN You should see your eyes right now, you're death. Look at your eyes -- you're crazy man, you look crazy. You scare me. \nJIM No no no John John. God is crazy too. God is part insane as well as sane. Not in control all the time. Dionysus was the God of the wine. He made ecstasy but he also made madness. Madness is all right. That's what you want, isn't it, isn't it? Where's that joint? \nROBBIE (crying) I get scared thinking of all the choices inside. I could go. I could stay. I can live anywhere. I could die now if I wanted. It's limitless choice... and no one cares. \nJIM Die Robbie. \nJOHN What the fuck! \nPAM (wandering in) I don't know what I am. I'm on the cusp of Sagittarius and Capricorn. Sagittarius is wild and Capricorn domestic and safe, so I don't know which one to be. \nJim looking at her, smiles. \nJIM I love you. \nDOROTHY (into the same lens) Oh my God, the light, it's so beautiful Ray. Can you see it... it's all one... honey? \nRay has his head buried in his hands. \nRAY I'm in pain man. I want something from the peyote. I feel the universe functioning perfectly but I'm still perfectly locked inside myself. Instead of Oneness, I feel total Isolation. Aloneness. Fear... Pain... Jim, all I feel is pain. \nJIM Pain makes me feel more alive Ray. Pain is meant to wake us up. People try to hide their pain but they're wrong. \nJOHN I feel Lust. I want to fuck everything I can, and I know it will never be enough. \nJIM (whispers) Pam wants you. (normal) You're a good Catholic John, you want it so you can feel guilty about it... Fuck death away John. \nROBBIE I feel Fear... so bad I just numb out all my feelings. I'm afraid of my father, I'm afraid of Yahweh... I wish I could play my guitar. \nJIM Maybe you should kill your father Robbie. He tried to kill you. Kill him! \nROBBIE I'm so fucking scared. \nJIM But you're Alive! It's beautiful! Fear, pain, lust, we've got to know all our feelings before we can come out the other side free men. Don't feel ashamed of yourselves, don't let society destroy your reality. Our freedom's the only thing worth dying for, it's the only thing worth living for! \nHe takes Ray and Robbie's hands, his voice calming them, reform the circle. John hesitant. Not all will enter the gates at evening. \nJOHN (cold sweats) I'm not gonna make it man. I'm scared Jim, I'm still scared. Blindness is coming on. \nJIM Then use us John, use our strength, it's us four now, a tribe of warriors, everything we have comes from the same source, the great Creator of Being. Trust him, trust us. Ride the snake. . . I promise you I will be with you till the end of time. \nPulling John into the circle, bonding, their four heads sunk to the desert floor, Jim making wild Indian sounds, deep- throated \"shoooh... shoooh\"... now humming a song from the desert. \nJIM My wild love went riding... mmmmmm. She rode all the day. She ride to the devil. And ask for him to pay... shooo shoooo \nThe OTHERS join in his chant, the four rising and falling like a collective breath. \nJIM (ad lib) ...she went to the desert she went to the sea Joseph we did see... \nSuddenly Jim breaks and rises out of the circle. Ray, Robbie, John, all looking at him. The same need. Pamela, the desperation of her eyes. \nJIM (to himself) ...I'm lying to you. I am scared. \nHe goes, his boots in the sand. \nJOHN Jim, where are you going. \nJIM (looking back) I'll be back. I gotta go alone. \nPamela calling from another dune, far away. \nPAM Jim! Jim... come here, dance... don't go away. \nHis POV -- of her, receding. She screams for him. He's in pain. Cannot help her. \nA BIRD of prey in the sky. \nJim moving across a lunar landscape. SPECIAL EFFECT: The sun is black like night or else white in a black sky. Voices in the distance. \"Jim, where are you going?\" A mother's voice, a father's voice. \nDOORS SONG Can you picture what will be So limitless and free Desperately in need of some stranger's hand in a desperate land Lost in a Roman wilderness of pain and all the children are insane: waiting for the summer rain \nFLASHBACKS \nINT. CAR - MOVING - DESERT \nJIM, 4, in the back of a car in the desert -- looking back... \nAt the overturned truck, the bodies in the road... at the older Indian looking at him... finally at the dying Indian... his eyes. \nINT. MORRISON HOME - DAY \nSomewhere. The child alone. On the living room floor. Drawing his sketches in a book. MOM's feet moving past -- then DAD'S feet. We may sense a subtle shift in mood when the parents come in -- from the boy's eyes which never leave the sketch he is drawing. \nEXT.

CHATEAU MARMONT HOTEL - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT \nJIM dangles out on the narrow ledge that circumscribes the 20th floor rooftop -- wind blowing thru his wild hair, the card zooming by like racer lights on Sunset below.

She is closer. But shaky. \nRAY (white) They're both gonna die... ARE YOU HAPPY YOU COCKSUCKERS!! \nRay goes after Tom Baker and the Film Crew. A scuffle. Yelling, shouting, but down below in the intimacy of the ledge, blowing out on the edge, the wind and the world and death. Two crazy children linked on this gothic balcony of the Chateau reach their hands out for each other. \nJIM Come on baby, come on \nPAM (quoting him) \"...but one, the most beautiful one of all -- dances in a ring of fire -- \nJIM (raw singing) \"I see your hair is burning.

You cut your hair! \nDOROTHY We're trying to have another baby. \nJIM (moving past her) What -- was your hair getting in the way? (she smacks him lightly) Where are the kids? \nEXT. RAY YARD - DAY \nHe spots them, crossing to the YARD where a CHILDREN'S BIRTHDAY is in progress -- TWO DOZEN KIDS, a CLOWN acting out for them. A few parents and friends -- ROBBIE and LYNNE, their kid, JOHN and his RECENT LADY, their kid... \nWhen the KIDS spot JIM they light up. \nJIM Hey -- am I late or is this the cool remnant of a dream? \nKIDS (rushing to him) Eee! Jim! It's Uncle Jim... Come on... what did you bring me Jim... \nJIM (picks up Robin) How's my girl! And how's my boy! \nThey stick a ludicrous printed birthday hat on his head. A bearded Santa Claus now engulfed with kids, though puffy, body gone, a literal physical wreck, yet a gentle pathos about him and still a charisma that the children react to without thinking. He gives out the presents all over. \nJIM (ad libs) For you... Pancho gets this one... Melanie -- yours... Hey Dorothy don't grab now... open that one, that's yours... keep your paws off that now... \nAs RAY and ROBBIE and JOHN and the others circle him. \nJIM (to Robin, a 5 year old) ...and to you, princess, from your Royal servant, James Douglas Morrison (bows) \nAs ROBIN, the cutest of them all, a bow in her hair, takes the package, opens it. \nRAY You wanna hear the new mixes on \"LA WOMAN?\"... \nJIM No, I gotta plane to catch. \nJOHN Won't take long man, it's the best one since \"Days\". \nROBBIE We added rain to \"Riders\", come on. \nJim cocks his head, listening to it playing from an inner room, his eyes on ROBIN opening the gift -- a beautiful, ANTIQUE DOLL of an 19th century poet -- rock star, stuffed, velour jacket, white fluffy lace collar, it could be Byron or it could be Jim Morrison -- in fact the hair is perfectly weaved to resemble Jim in his young lion phase -- an ironic gift, meant from the heart.

Jim drinks from a cognac bottle straight, foot tapping, enjoying it, knows it's good -- but other things are calling. This is history. \nJIM I gotta admit -- that ain't bad for four guys who weren't even talking that day. \nSlapping shoulders, shaking hands. \nJOHN You really gonna live in Paris man? \nJIM Yeah John, be anonymous, write a book: \"Observations of an American While on Trial in Miami\". \nROBBIE I still think we got a couple of great blues albums in us man. \nJIM I'm pinned man.

I'm gonna miss the feeling of playing music with you. \nJIM You can always whip the horses' eyes. You, John, miss me? \nJOHN More than you think asshole. (turn away, repressing -- the emotions) \nROBBIE (walking him to the garden) Well far as I'm concerned, Jim, I made music with Dionysus man.

We're gonna play again some day. \nROBBIE Jim -- \"do not go gently into that good night. Rage rage against the dying of the light\".

GARDEN - LATER DAY \nJIM, a bearded Santa Claus with the birthday hat on his head, surrounded by the GIRLS and BOYS and DOROTHY shooting a home movie. They're eating birthday cake but UNCLE JIM is drinking straight from the cognac bottle -- a strange sight. \nJIM (to Robin) So what are you gonna be when you grow up? \nROBIN I wanna be your wife \nHe laughs, looks at Dorothy who's shooting him with the Super \nJIM I don't know, can I afford you? Pam kinda wiped me out with her dress store y'know... \nROBIN I'll make my own dresses and you'll see, I'll be the best wife. \nDOROTHY (nodding) You'll never be alone Jim. \nJIM (to Dorothy) You know I've never been happier. Not as much of a rush as I used to be in y'know... this is the strangest life I've ever known. \nHis eyes on a LITTLE BOY who's walking into the party, sitting down with the others, ignored, isolated, a birthday cap on his head. Clothes belong to the 1940's and the face seems familiar. Jim is not sure, woozy from the cognac. As he fades. We saw the Boy many years ago in the backseat of the car in the Arizona desert. \nJim's head falling gently into his folded arms on the table, the cognac bottle at his elbow, merlin hat on, beard, the kids laughing, pulling his ears and nose -- he doesn't wake up. \nTIME CUT TO: \nAs Ray comes over now, rouses him gently. \nRAY Gotta plane to catch man? \nJim coming awake in that instant alert way of his, but obviously hung over. \nJIM O?... splittling headache from which the future is made. \nPuzzling remark, He gets up, shaky, exits, kids tearing at him. Goodbyes. \nEXT. RAY'S HOUSE - VENICE - TWILIGHT \nThe beach is behind them, the last of the frisbee players and dogs, the skaters go by, as we continue to hear RIDERS from within. \nRAY Is Pam really there in Paris waiting? \nJIM (ironic, head hurts) Sure. The Count's there so where else would she be? Gotta try to start over, without all the hassles, y'know. I think we can. \nRAY I never knew what you saw in that nightmare chick man. \nJIM Well she is kinda flakey -- like me. I mean she's just so vulnerable about everything. It makes me sad man. (pause) But she's always kinda believed in something about me y'know -- her little picture of me as the unsung poet -- and it's a fantasy I kinda dig y'know, 'stead of the one I live. \nRAY I don't know man, I don't wanna sound like your old man but you're only 27, you're living like you gotta get it all in, you gotta slow down man, you did it, you broke thru to the other side. \nJIM We didn't break thru Ray, we just pushed things a little. When you really break thru, there's nothing left. No music, no Doors, no God, nothing -- only a will to power. \nRAY I don't believe that. You were an American prince, man -- with overbred genes -- (Jim scoffs, laughs) No! What could've been Jim? You could've been President. (Jim cracks up) No man! What could've been Jim? We stood here on this beach on the edge of the Pacific that crazy summer day in '65 -- and we knew, you and I, we knew we were at the edge of the mind. we were there, man. One planet, one globe, one mind. Consciousness, we raised it, we were there. \nJim, not the sentimental type, climbs in his car, amused. \n", "test3_true": "RAY Now?

And he's gone. An ominous ROAR of an AIRPLANE above RAY. -- flying away. \nEXT. LOS ANGELES - TWILIGHT \nThe PLANE flies off into the setting ball of red sun. \nINT. RECORDING SESSION (LAST SESSION) - L.A. - DEC. \nThe bearded POET hunches in his chair, exhausted, clutching the paper, finished. Pause. He downs a final shot, grunts to the Indian Ghostman sitting there on a stool watching him in the corner of the studio. The Ghostman laughs (but nothing comes out of his mouth). His wrinkled eyes are happy, feathered ponytail, he nods... pleased. \nMORRISON Well, didja get all that? \nGHOSTMAN You done good, Jim, go now -- rest \nThe ENGINEER, exhausted, doesn't feel anything funny. \nENGINEER Yeah, I got it Jim. \nThe poets face brightens. A small but ever-so-sweet smile of triumph hikes up the corners of his mouth. \nJIM Aw right. Let's get some tacos! \nHe stands, sways, than moves out of view. The empty bottle of whiskey, its sands run out, is left behind. \nAs we FADE OUT, a hardy, mischievous Morrison laugh and a ripple of sensuous MUSIC carry us into the lilting, lamenting strains of AN AMERICAN PRAYER -- THE END without lyrics for now as we cut to: \nINT. PARIS BEDROOM - NEAR DAWN (NIGHT) (1971) \nPAMELA is agitated in her sleep -- waking as she feels him watching. Is that him? At the door? A SHADOW -- leaves. Footsteps moving down the narrow Parisian corridor with the creaky floor. \nPAM Jim... that you? \nLooks at the time. Somewhere near dawn. The sounds of a bath being drawn. Nightmare or sleep? She tries to fade back to sleep but the MUSIC and the WHISPERING prod her, pull her awake... \nDISSOLVE: SAME FACE -- AN HOUR LATER. \nPutting her robe on, the slippers, the light... moving. She is much more ravaged looking than before. \nINT. BATHROOM - DAWN \nShe finds him now... His face floating upwards, angelic eyes, the beard is now gone, a little smile on his face. He must be playing another joke. Although she really knows as she says the words: \nPAM Jim! It was you. I always know when it's you. (moving closer) Come on baby get out of the tub... mama'll dry you off... (pause) Jim Morrison, now you stop joking you hear me, cut it out! \nHis face. At peace, as she sobs, the MUSIC cresting to Jim's lyrics. \nPAM ...was it all right Jim, did you enjoy it when it came my baby? Just like you said it'd be? \nJIM (OVER) They are waiting to take us into the severed garden do you know how pale and wanton thrillful comes death at a strange hour? Unannounced unplanned for like a scaring overfriendly guest you've brought to bed? Death makes angels of us all? And gives us wings where we had shoulders smooth as raven's claws... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. PERE LACHAISE CEMETERY - PARIS - DAY \nHis face etching into a perfect Alexandrine bust of physical beauty. The camera moving to reveal, a wintry day, leaves blowing, the wild cats everywhere in the empty cemetery, the crumbling tombs, the flowers fresh and dead around Jim's tomb, the graffiti, wine bottles, Wilde, Bizet, Piaf, Chopin, Morrison... \nJIM (OVER) No more money, no more fancy dress this other kingdom seems by far the best until its other jaw reveals incest and loose obedience to a vegetable law. I will not go I prefer a feast of friends to the giant family... \nThe MUSIC rolling up on: \nINT. CORRIDOR & STAGE - LIMBO \nSmoke. Some lights. The distant cheers of a CROWD. In slightly SLOW MOTION, a FIGURE moves down a corridor into a blinding light of stage and smoke. THREE OTHER SHADOWS are there waiting -- as the GHOST moves to the microphone in altered motion. \nThe AUDIENCE is out there somewhere in the dark -- we sense they too have become ghosts, as all of us will one day. The MUSIC continuing up to roll from AMERICAN PRAYER -- THE END -- snatches we annotate. \nGHOST ANNOUNCER Ladies and Gentlemen, from Los Angeles California -- The Doors! (ghostly applause) \nJIM & THE DOORS (snatches) ...have you seen the warm progress under the stars? Have you forgotten the keys to the kingdom? Have you been born yet and are you alive? Where is the feast we were promised? Let's reinvent the gods, the myths of the ages! We need great golden copulations \nCamera closing past the DOORS to JIM alone, circling the mike with his dance -- the INDIAN GHOSTMAN jigging, shaman- like, off to the side -- now levitating above the stage, all crazy, gawky dancing. \nJIM Well, I'll tell you a story of whiskey, mystics and men And about the believers and how the whole thing began First there were women and children obeying the moon Then daylight brought wisdom and sickness too soon... the moon is a dry blood beast We have assembled inside this ancient and insane theatre to propagate our lust for life and flee the swarming wisdom of the streets we live we die and death not ends it (screams in agony) FATHER HAVE MERCY!!! \nEnding with a solitary sing-song croak. \nJIM Bird of prey, bird of prey Flying high, flying high in the summer sky Bird of prey, bird of prey flying high, flying high gently pass by Bird of prey, bird of prey flying high, flying high Take me on your flight (pause then) I will come again down from the wild mountains \nTHE SUBTITLE READS \"JIM IS SAID TO HAVE DIED OF 'HEART FAILURE'.

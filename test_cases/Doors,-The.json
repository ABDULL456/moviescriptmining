{"train": "\"THE DOORS\" \nScreenplay by \nRandall Jahnson and Oliver Stone \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nINT. BLACK SCREEN \nMORRISON'S VOICE The movie will begin in five moments The mindless voice announced All those unseated will await the next show We filed slowly, languidly into the hall The auditorium was fast and silent As we seated and were darkened The voice continued \"The program for this evening is not new You've seen this entertainment Through and through You've seen your birth, your life and death You might recall all the rest Did you have a good world when you died? Enough to base a movie on?\" \nFADE IN: \nINT. RECORDING STUDIO (LAST SESSION) - LA DEC 1970 - NIGHT \nA dark silence hovers along the deserted, bunker-like studio. MIKE stands and booms shadow a grand piano... \nThe ENGINEER waits in the booth, lit, alert man, bored, fiddling... \nENGINEER Hey Jim, It's your birthday man, whaddaya say we try this another night... \nCamera moving tentatively along the shadows, discovering the sidelight on a Navy surplus pea jacket thrown on a chair; moving to a candle's orange flutter on pages written with verse... a hand breaking the seal of the bottle of Irish Bushmill's whiskey. \nVOICE (off) Kill the lights a little more, will ya John? \nThey might drop a bit more... Camera crawling past the FINGERS weaving a new cigarette out of the Marlboro pack. An ashtray full of butts... and an asthmatic horrid cough, filled with phlegm... crawling up the slight paunch in the bright jersey with #66 on it... stitched on the sleeve is the team mascot -- an American Indian in full headdress. \nENGINEER (off) Hey man, how come the Doors aren't in on this? \nCamera revealing JAMES DOUGLAS MORRISON, -- 27, poet, buried in the shadows, curls of cigarette smoke about his haunted sensuous eyes, meditative lips scragged with beard and long greasy hair, not a pretty sight, yet a man full and bold and struggling for survival through his words... beneath the Bushmill moon, he takes the tambourine and shakes it violently in our face \nJIM No music, No Doors. Let's roll... Is everybody in?... Is Everybody in?... Is everybody in? The ceremony is about to begin... \nHe shakes a TAMBOURINE at the mike and one of his sudden giant Indian YELLS rock through the studio. \nJIM WAKE UP!!!! HAS THIS DREAM STOPPED!!!! \nMusic riffs from \"American Prayer\". AUDIENCE SOUNDS ghostly on the track. The ENGINEER reeling backwards from the sudden shift in sound, cursing silent. \nJIM VOICE Let me tell you about the heartache and the loss of God Wandering wandering in hopeless night Indian's scattered on dawn's highway bleeding ghosts crowd the young childs fragile eggshell mind... (wind sounds) \nThe GRIN on Jim's face magnesium flares out to: \nEXT. ARIZONA DESERT - DAY (1940'S) \nThe blinding YELLOWNESS of the desert, so barren, so hot it stings to look at. An OLD CHEVROLET winds through the yellow- orange landscape beneath a brooding blue SKY crackling with ELECTRICITY -- the storm coming in in the distance as the MUSIC writhes out at us like a reptile from under a rock -- the beat of RIDERS ON THE STORM. \nDOORS SONG Riders on the storm (2) Into this house we're born Into this world we're thrown Like a dog without a bone An actor out on loan Riders on the storm \nCREDITS ROLL, OVER THIS DREAMSCAPE \nJIM VOICE (continues over imagery) ...me and my mother and father and grandmother and grandfather were driving through the desert at dawn and a truckload of Indian workers had either hit another car or just -- I don't know what happened... Indians were scattered all over the highway bleeding to death. \nINT. CAR - DAY \nMOM, DAD, the youngest BABY in the front seat -- pointing at the storm. \nGRANDMA & GRANDAD in the back with JIM, about 4 and his SISTER, 3 asleep. \nMom's a beauty and Dad's an austere handsome military man in civilian clothes, mouthing words -- look, wake them up, a desert storm... but we barely hear \nA LIGHTNING BOLT shreds the blue sky with a thunderous sound, frightening dawn of creation... \nGrandma nudging Jim awake. His eyes open -- \nJust as the car turns the bend -- revealing \nAn overturned TRUCK lying in the road -- dead and wounded INDIANS everywhere... A cop car, ambulance. A terrible accident... \nThe first thing Jim sees... \nAn old INDIAN FACE staring at him... \nThe car pulling alongside, Dad rolling his window down... asking if he can help (SOUNDLESS) A line of wailing INDIAN WOMEN, CHILDREN \nMom's scared face... \nJIM VOICE ...but it was the first time I tasted fear. I musta been about four, like a child is just like a flower, his head is floating in the breeze. \nGrandma trying to hide Jim's face but he looks back... \nTHE COP WAVING THEM THROUGH \nThe kid looking back through the rear window, terrified -- his first view of death. The bodies, the sense of doom overlaying the land -- a child's worst nightmare. \nMOM It's just a dream, Jimmy, just a dream \nSONG (continues) There's a killer on the road His brain is squirming like a toad Take a long holiday Let your children play If you give this man a ride Sweet family will die There's a killer on the road \nThe boy's eyes going back to the Indian MAN looking at him... then to the dying opened body bleeding out its guts on the asphalt... the dying man's face, twisted, moaning, amazing eyes at the point of death -- they settle on Jim \nMOM It's just a dream Jimmy, just a dream \nA strange SOUND occurs -- the rattle of an ancient gourd, \"shi-chi-chi, shi-chi-chi\". Something flying through the air. A bull-roarer, a whirling leather thong, announcing the appearance of a shaman. \nINTO JIM -- his eyes staring out the back His receding point of view -- the Indians, the overturned truck... \nJIM VOICE ...The reaction I get now looking back is the soul of the ghosts of those dead Indians -- maybe one or two of them were just running around freaking out and just leaped into my soul -- and they're still there. (wind, music) \nJIM ...cause... you're the one... \nHe moves. Kisses her swiftly, softly, right on the lips. \nGIRL (mesmerized, awkward) Wow... neat... (looks back) ...maybe you should meet my old man? \nJIM Later. You got a name? \nHe looks into her face. Classic American face, freckles, big round eyes soft as rain, long sunset red hair. She feels his intense, starving eyes. He kisses her a second time. \nThe YOUNG MAN coming back with the rolling paper -- sees him. \nAs he hops back on the railing -- swings out into the tree -- looks back once. \nJIM Mine's Jim. \nA moment. She must decide. The YOUNG MAN within earshot. \nGIRL Pam... \nThe ice broken in that instant. Jim smiles. \nJIM Jim and Pam, Pam and Jim... \nHe vanishes. The Man abreast of Pamela, as if he's seen a vision. \nYOUNG MAN Who the hell was that? \nPAMELA (everything's cool) That's Jim. My new friend. \nINT. UCLA SCREENING ROOM - DAY (1965) \nOn the screen a 16mm black and white student film of a stunning BLOND in black bra, panties, garters dancing in black heels on top of a TV set. panning down to images of goose-stepping Nazis and a Nuremberg rally on the set. Sounds of lovemaking and an Indian peyote ceremony from the track, an Indian holy man incanting... Jim's VOICE comes on the track as well. \nJIM'S VOICE Nietzche said \"all great things must first wear monstrous and terrifying masks in order to inscribe themselves on the hearts of humanity\". Listen children -- to the sound of the Nuremberg night. \nSTUDENTS in the audience groan at the pretention of it. Moving to JIM's eyes hidden in his parka hood, peeking through at the screen. \nA CLOSEUP now of JIM on screen looking straight into the lens as he takes a hit on a hash pipe, and winks. \nJIM VOICE (on screen) Have you ever seen God? -- a mandala. A symmetrical angel. Felt? Yes. Fucking the Sun. Heard? The music. Voices. Touched? An animal. Your hand Tasted? Rare meat, corn, water and wine \nSTUDENTS (ad lib) SSSSssss... ego trip man, c'mon! \nRAY MANZAREK, a tall student with powerful voice and manner, thick glasses, long hair sweeping down over his eyes, leans over to Jim. \nRAY Hey man it's great, don't listen to em, it's non-linear man, it's poetry man, everything Godard stands for. \nThe lights coming on as the last absurdist images flicker off. Hissing and a big Bronx cheer summarize the feelings of the 100 odd STUDENTS crammed into a bunker-like theater. \nA youngish INSTRUCTOR stirs to the front row from a row of upset FACULTY. Hands shooting up to criticize. \nINSTRUCTOR This is pretty shocking stuff Mr. Morrison. And I might say indulgent. Naziism and masturbation, when used for shock value, are not art. But to be constructive, let's start with your intention. What was it? \nSTUDENT 1 It was a bore!! That's what! (laughter) \nTRICK, BONES and JACK, three friends sitting next to Jim, shoot their hands up. \nTRICK Hey it was better'n a Warhol picture. \nGIRL 1 No it wasn't. It was worse! \nTRICK A guy sleeping for seven hours... \nSTUDENT 2 ...is less pretentious! There was no political consciousness. Naziism is... \nJACK Hey hold on man! You guys are the facists! \nBONES It takes genitalism to absurdity man, just cause the squares here can't dig it cause the film school's still so square... \nVOICES Oh c'mon man, give it a break. Boo! Beatniks go home! Take another mushroom... \nA cacophony of voices, critics, emotions blend out over Jim's quiet eyes. \nINSTRUCTOR HOLD IT DOWN!!... Mr. Morrison -- what are your feelings? \nJIM I quit. (walks out) \nEXT. TURKEY JOINT WEST - NIGHT \nJIM, BONES, TRICK, JACK approaching the bar. MUSIC of \"GLORIA\" blasting from the door, CHICKS popping in and out, definitely college crowd circa '65. \nTRICK (to Jim) Hey man whatdya expect, an Oscar? \nBONES You can't quit, you gotta voice. People can't dig cause they don't understand yet. \nJACK If you're an individual, if you're too good, they wanna cut your dick off. Look what happened to Orson Wells. \nTRICK You quit now, they'll yank your deferment in no time and they'll get you for Vietnam man. Three more months you graduate. \nBONES Be cool, you never learned fuckin patience Morrison, you want everything at once. \nNICK They didn't get it. So make your films and fuck what they think. \nJIM You know what I think? \nHe slows, a dramatic young lion pose, surveying the girls. \nBONES Yeah whadday you think? \nThe two of them race down by its side, slowing to a walk. His [...] loved orphan voice. \nJIM Can I stay with you tonight? We could talk 'till dawn. I just don't want to be alone. \nPAM (hesitant) Okay... just talk though. No funny stuff. \nJIM Okay. I promise. \nPAM I've been real upset. I lost my car on the freeway yesterday. I left it somewhere and I can't remember where and when I went back it was gone. My sister... \nJIM I bet you never expected life could be this hard. (strokes her hair affectionately) And you're still so young. \nShe breaks into sobs, seeking his arms. He hugs her. \nJIM I wonder where we'll be ten years from now? \nPAM I really don't want to know \nJIM Come on. \nJIM (SONG) Choose now, they croon Beneath the moon Beside an ancient lake Enter again the sweet forest Enter the hot dream Come with us Everything is broken up and dances \nEXT. VENICE BUILDING - NIGHT \nTheir silhouettes mount the fire escape of a jagged old structure overlooking the boardwalk. \nEXT. VENICE ROOFTOP - NIGHT \nPAM glancing through Jim's notebooks as they sit on his sleeping bag with a lantern and bunsen burner, overlooking moon, ocean, scudding clouds and a vast forest of television antennas. Fires burn from the beach. \nIn the notebooks, at intervals during the conversation, we see powerful sketches colored in visionary hallucinogenic William Blake mode with writing between. Books are everywhere -- panning Kerouac, Ginsberg, Nietzsche, Rimbaud, Mailer, Artaud, mythological works, shamanistic books, a library of stolen ideas. \nPAM (reading, looking) These are like beautiful! I never read much poetry in school. I hated it. What's a \"shaman\"? (mispronounces) \nJIM He's the medicine man who starts in a peyote trance. And he gets everyone in the tribe going and they share in his vision and it heals them. It's the same in all cultures -- Greeks, Jesus. Some Indians say the first shaman invented sex. He's the one who makes you crazy. \nPAM Are you a \"shaman\"? \nJIM Uh (pause) no. I just write about it. What turns you on? \nPAM I don't know. Experience. Freedom. Love... Now. Peyote's like love. When it's given it's blessed. When it's sold it's damned. I like peyote. I like acid, it's easier to get. I like the spiritual voyage. The first time I did acid I saw God. I did. I had a friend who was Christ. And he was Judas too. I suddenly knew the secret of everything -- that we're all one, the universe is one. And that everything is beautiful. \nJIM Is it? I don't know. I think you're alive by confronting death -- by experiencing pain. \nPAM I think you're alive by recognizing beauty -- seeing truth because when you discover truth you discover what love is... we're all saying the same thing. It's \"love me and I'll love you.\" \nJIM (looks at her, ironic) It's only thru death that you know life. Jesus, medicine men heal people by sacrificing their own life. \nPAM Do you love Death? \nJIM I think life hurts a lot more than death. When you die the pain is over. \nPam shivers, a strange thought. \nPAM Why do I look at you... and see my death? (pause, shrugs) No, that's ridiculous. \nJIM I bet your dad's a school teacher. \nPAM How did you know! \nJIM I don't know. \nPAM What was your father? \nJIM Military \nPAM I bet you moved around a lot. \nJIM Yeah, about 8 times. \nPAM How many sisters and brothers? \nJIM Two. \nPAM One... she's the pretty one... I love your neck. (she gets in his lap) \nHe runs his fingers thru her hair, kissing her gently. \nJIM \"...but one, the most beautiful one of all dances in a ring of fire and throws off the challenge with a shrug\" \nPAM That's beautiful. Who did you write it for? \nJIM I wrote it for you. \nThe panties coming off. Rousseau dangling from the Venice moon. He moves a little over excited, nervous, more awkward than we might expect. \nPAM ...take your time, Jim... there's no hurry, I'm all you have to do tonight... \nDOORS SONG Well the clock says it's time to close now I guess I'd better go now... As we depart the rooftop. Your fingers weak with minarets Speaking secret alphabets I light another cigarette Learn to forget, learn to forget, learn to forget \nDISSOLVE TO: \nPossibly we hear the soft backbeat of MOONLIGHT DRIVE without lyrics. \nRAY MANZAREK is meditating in yoga posture, longer hair as well, in his post-graduate phase, sandals, colorful hippie shirt. But the meditation is not going well. He's shaking his head at himself, frowning. \nRAY Om om... No bliss! No bliss! \nJim has approached closer, amused, looking down. \nJIM Let's try it again, come on. I'm just getting into it. \nPAM (on floor) I think it's hot!! \nROBBIE (strumming) I still think the lyrics are weird man. \nJOHN (frustrated) I still think it sounds like the bottom of a fishbowl man. \nJIM (to Robbie, aggravated) Then you write one man! We need more songs anyway. We all gotta go back and write. \nThey're drained, tired, in a large rehersal/living room 30 feet high, fronted by large glass windows looking out at the beach at Marina. The room is filled with golden, gorgeous setting sunlight. \nPAMELA goes to the kitchen with DOROTHY, Ray's Japanese fiancee. \nROBBIE I been working on something goes like this... A minor. (chords his guitar) \"You know that it would be untrue You know that I would be a liar If I was to say to you Girl, we couldn't get much higher\" F sharp... chorus \"Come on baby, light my fire Try to set the night on fire...\" \nRobbie's voice is tinny but something immediate's in the air, all the radar out. \nRAY Okay man there's some good changes in there. \nJIM Got any more lyrics? \nROBBIE (gives Jim a page of lyrics) Some. I call it \"Light My Fire\". I figger if I'm gonna compete with your stuff it's gotta be about earth, fire or snakes. \nJIM Don't underestimate Death. \nJOHN Yeah but it sounds like the Byrds man, we're not folk rock man. How 'bout trying it with a Latin beat. \nROBBIE I thought we could do the usual verse chorus verse chorus and \nJOHN We don't need a bridge. \nROBBIE Yeah, we could maybe improvise a couple piano and guitar solos over it (kicks in second verse) \"The time to hesitate is through\" (doesn't have the second line) Du du duh dud dada . . . \nJIM (spontaneous) \"No time to wallow in the mire Try now we can only lose And our love become a funeral pyre Come on baby light my fire\" \nJohn drumming it, different, more Latin. \nJIM Pretty good! Pretty neat!! \nRAY (to John) Nice groove, John. Chaka chaka chaka, then bula burump bula (to Robbie) ...you're right, it could take a coupla long solos, that's wild man, like Butterfield did on \"East-West\" -- really hip. \nROBBIE Y'ever heard Coltrane's \"Favorite Things\"? \nJOHN (hitting the drums) Yeah -- maybe stretch it out and put it in 4/4 on bass, 3/4 on guitar and snare. \nRAY (clicking, excited) Why not! A minor to B minor. Jazz! That then is jazz! But it needs a hook. Something. Give me some space. I need some space. Leave the room guys. Come on! Go! \nThe three excluded Doors head out to the beach like obedient schoolboys while Ray fools with his organ. \nEXT. VENICE BEACH - DAY \nAs they go out, JIM hugging ROBBIE's head to his shoulder as they feel the excitement of a new song. \nJOHN (irritated at Ray) Guy's obnoxious, man always bossin' people around! I thought we were equals! \nJIM Aren't we? (to Robbie) That was great Robbie. Whaddaya thinking about when you play? \nROBBIE Don't know. Mostly the fish in my fish tank. \nJIM (laughs) Hey whadya say we take some of that Tijuana acid and see what kinda trouble we can get into tonight? \nROBBIE The chicks always go for you man. I get the dogs. \nJIM Then we'll start a religion or plan a murder or go to Tijuana. \nJOHN Whatsamatter with you man, what about Pam, you got the morals of a coyote. \nJIM Why you wanna sleep with her John, just to bug me? \nJOHN Hell NO! \nJIM ...means \"hell yes\". She likes you man, she really does and y'all should. What's a rock and roll band for man, if you can't party all night and do bad things? \nRAY (yelling from the house) I GOT IT I GOT IT... GET IN HERE. HURRY. \nJOHN Sieg Heil! \nAs they head back. \nINT. RAY'S HOUSE - DAY \nTIGHT on RAY like a schoolmaster cueing them. \nRAY Okay here it is. Bach and Rock. Count it off John \nJOHN (clicking) (crack) \nIt goes. The famous organ intro to LIGHT MY FIRE blends over the room like magic, carrying JIM, ROBBIE, JOHN, DOROTHY, PAMELA along over: \nEXT. SUNSET STRIP (TRAVELLING) - NIGHT (1966) \nA row of NIGHTCLUBS glisten off the hoods of passing traffic. Marquees announce: THE BYRDS, RED ROOSTER, LOVE, THE HERD, TURTLES, CAPTAIN BEEFHEART. The CLUBS are PANDORA'S BOX, THE TRIP, CIRO'S, BIDO LITO'S, GAZZARRI'S, THE EXPERIENCE... . Headlights and neon intercut with: \nDOCUMENTARY TYPE SHOTS of TEENAGERS, HIPPIES, LONGHAIRS, running summer rampant, banging tambourines. COPS busting kids against cars on the street as PARENTS go by rolling up their windows. The action was on the street. LIGHT MY FIRE carries over the montage. \nDOORS SONG You know that it would be untrue etc. \nJIM VOICE (last session) The music was new black polished chrome and came over the summer like liquid night. \nHe is in an isolated cathedral of rocks. The CRONE, muttering, leaving through another crevice. Suddenly a MOUNTAIN LION is visible, stretched hugely across a rock. It growls ferociously, upset, and suddenly shoots out the back of the cave. Silence. \nJim, thunderstruck, gaping. A gallery of ancient INDIAN PETROGLYPHS surround him on all sides. Curious, oblong figures, buffalo, sacred deer and bear, creatures of the hunt; hunters and their weapons, rain clouds, masked deities proclaiming the answers to the Mysteries, the story of Creation. \nCamera weaving up to see one of the faces of the deities -- staring at him from the wall -- an eagle's face... \nDOORS SONG There's danger on the edge of town Ride the King's highway Weird scenes inside the gold mine Ride the King's highway west, baby \nThe sound of a rattle -- \"shichishichi\" -- he realizes he's being watched. By what? He whips his eyes everywhere. A large LIZARD perches on a boulder assesses him calmly, tatters of a former skin clinging to its throat, spits a forked tongue and drills its black pearly eyes into his skull... Now the sound of the Bull-Roarer, whipping the air, announcing the appearance of the shaman. \nJim's struck with an overwhelming sense of... awe... ancient mysteries. He turns. The lizard is looking at him. \nThe GHOST of the DEAD INDIAN is also looking at him. We are looking at JIM from its point of view -- a blur of light, some headdress, a sense of skins... music drops back, no lyrics... the voice is old, familiar, possible Spanish descent dialect or huararchi. \nINDIAN GHOST VOICE ...you are a prince among white men, yet you are a warrior among us. You are ready now. Go out \"walk with the pain of the world, travel to the end of the wind\" -- and change it for all men as you were born to do. \nThe voice, the pretense, -- the glow too quickly fades -- leaving Jim so alone, not sure what he has heard, yet he knows he has heard, and he knows he has seen -- and once you have seen, it will never be the same again. His eyes. \nEXT. CAVE - DAY \nJIM exits the cave. \nMATCH CUT TO: \nINT. WHISKY A GO GO - NIGHT \nEXTREME CLOSE on JIM'S EYES as he continues with THE END. \nDOORS SONG Ride the snake Ride the snake, to the lake The ancient lake The snake is long, seven miles Ride the snake He's old, and his skin is cold \nCamera pulling out from his eyes. There's something different tonight. Something in the air. His eyes are open, he's facing outward, gripping the mike for his life, hair falling in his face, dripping sweat, we sense all his soul concentrated in what he has to say. \nCliques of GROUPIES have staked claims at the foot of the stage, eyes fucking him as he writhes, spreading his legs. Every twitch, every moment he sucks out the tension on the musical interludes generates a whip of a reaction in his audience. \nNobody is moving in the club. The DANCERS are still, the GO GO GIRLS in their white plastic boots and dresses hang motionless in their gilded cages. Even the WAITRESSES have stopped, frozen with their trays, denying something is going to happen. \nPAMELA, DOROTHY... JERRY from the Fog, also the manager of this place, watches from the balcony, shaking his head, doesn't understand. Panning to two RECORD TYPES with him -- JAC HOLZMAN, distinguished six footer, suit, and PAUL ROTHCHILD, funky, pigtailed, ex-con, early 30s. \nJIM & DOORS The west is best (2) Get here and we'll do the rest The blue bus is calling us (2) Driver where you taking us? \nThe band has come together fully now. ROBBIE'S fingers sliding across the trembling strings, staring at the ceiling, wandering around the darkened portions of stage left, he feels Jim -- echoes him back with his flamenco-blues guitar. \nJOHN on drums, reading Jim's moods, throws in the spontaneous and violent riffs that keep it savage. He literally tortures Jim's ears with his drums. \nAnd RAY, concentrated with his nodding head like a big flamingo over his keyboard, mixing it up, throwing curves, yet also -- and more delicately -- torturing Jim with the messianic organ sounds that shriek in his ears. There is something of Merlin in Ray -- the alchemist knowing how to play Jim. \nAnd JIM -- \"that sneaky silent lithe flowing flexing animal\" -- ready at last to share both his body and his soul with the world, to live out the words of the Indian prophet... to lead. \nJIM The killer awoke before dawn He put his boots on He took a face from the ancient gallery And he walked on down the hall \nRay looks over up from his board, catches Robby with a 'what's this?' look... They go with it, improvising... \nJim clutching the mike tighter, seeking solace in its arms; it all hangs in the air as if he doesn't have any idea what he's going to say next. \nJIM He went to the room where his sister lived And he paid a visit to his brother And then he went on down the hall... \nPamela sensing something is coming... the AUDIENCE... Jerry... the go-go dancers... \nJIM And he came to a door, And he looked inside \"Father?\" \"Yes, son?\" \"I want to kill you\". \nFLASH -- A FATHER'S FACE, any face, older, any man... \nJIM Mother... I want to... \nFLASH -- A MOTHER'S FACE, any face, older, a woman \nJIM AAAAAAAGGGGGGGHHHHHHH YOOOOOUUUUUUUUUU!!!!! FUCK YOU ALL NIGHT! \nThe SCREAMS primal, pure Jim -- Indian savagery ripped from the depths of his soul, of his pain -- bouncing off the walls... \nAs the AUDIENCE gasps, shocked, stunned... \nAs the guitar hits a high, horrid reverb, JIM in slightly SLOW MOTION suddenly tightens his backbone as if electrocuted and shoots violently backwards, hitting the floor like a puppet cut from his string -- we sense Jim himself has crossed a barrier now, gone into yet another stage of his performance, a stage from which he can never return. Like the gunfighter who has killed his first man. \nRAY sees it instantly where it's going, hits the organ! Robbie and John follow. the instruments EXPLODE all at once trying to bury Jim in his primal unmistakeable scream. \nThe CLUB in shock. Tribal taboo broken in one instant. Jerry exploding off the balcony toward the stage... \nPamela, extremely moved and impressed, and Dorothy... the go- go girls, as jaded as they come, are stunned tension... the groupies love it. \nJim has jumped up now, dancing an Indian war dance around the mike. \nJIM Come on baby take a chance with us (X3) And meet me in the back of the blue bus Doona blue rog onna blue bus Doona blue yeah! Come on yeah! \nINT. BACKSTAGE WHISKY HALLWAY - THAT NIGHT \nJIM is being muscled out the door by JERRY, livid. \nJERRY NOBODY'S GONNA FUCK THEIR MOTHER ON MY STAGE! YOU'RE OUTTA HERE. You don't ever come back to play, you don't ever come back to drink -- You're DEAD ON THE STRIP! \nJIM (ranting back at him) Kill the father, fuck the mother, kill the father, fuck the mother -- that's what I'm into! That's what I'm into! \nJerry pinning Jim to the wall, \nJERRY You -- MORRISON! You're fucking filthy twisted perverse punk, get back to your fucking sewer!! \nJIM (calmly smiling) You have the face of a pig man. \nLost in the melee, RAY and JOHN springing Jim back from likely death \nEXT. AIRPORT TARMAC - DAY \nScreaming FANS chase the DOORS to a commercial airplane, scribbling autographs. One of the GIRLS smacking JIM on the lips as he laughs, her cameras clicking. PAMELA shooting a home movie of it, pushed aside by the crowd, rescued by ROBBIE and the new young manager, BILL SIDDONS... \nDOORS SONG Oh show me the way to the next whisky bar Oh don't ask why Oh don't ask why \nEXT. NEW YORK CITY SKYLINE (SEEN FROM PLANE) - DAY \nThe City as seen by: \nINT. AIRPLANE - DAY \nJIM'S face pressed to the window, PAMELA next to him hugging each other. \nJIM (real close, hugging her) I don't mind dying in a plane crash, a smile on my face. \nPAMELA (cutting his food) As compared to what? \nJIM I just don't want to go out slow -- brain tumor, botulism. I want to feel what it's like, cause death is only going to happen to you once. \nPAMELA I don't want to die ever, what a weird thing to say. \nDOORS SONG For if we don't find the next whisky bar I tell you we must die I tell you I tell you I tell you we must die \nEXT. CBS - NEW YORK - NIGHT (SUMMER, 1967) \nA LIMOUSINE pulling up in front of the Ed Sullivan Marquee. The sidewalk is mobbed with FANS, mostly YOUNG GIRLS. \nDOORS SONG Oh moon of Alabama We now must say goodbye We've lost our good ol mama We must have whiskey oh you know why \nINT. LIMO - NIGHT \nJIM looking out at the MOB with the other DOORS and PAMELA. The look on his face is ironic. \nHis POV -- the YOUNG GIRLS' FACES, arms grasping at the windows like tentacles of a poisonous hydra, their faces deformed by SILENT SCREAMS (we hear faint strangled shrieks below the song)... POLICE and SECURITY pressing them back, linking arms to clear a path for the Doors. \nDOORS SONG Show me the way to the next little girl Oh don't ask why Oh don't ask why \nThe GIRLS crying hysterically as Jim lazily, leopardly, moves across the CROWD, almost like Oswald waiting for the Ruby bullet but with that sweet, pleasant smile on his face, dark glasses concealing... \nGIRLS (faint) Oh Jimmmmm, pleeeaaase look, I looove youuuuu, Jimmmmmm, pleeeeeaase, Jimmmmm, here, sign miiiine... take a picture Jim?... Jim, Jim, oh please look at me Jim!! \nTheir voices distorting. A GIRLCHILD squeezing thru the cordon with the fatal bullet. In slightly SLOW MOTION, Jim seeing her come... as she glues herself hip to hip, lip to lip with Jim, her hands clawing at his leather pants. It takes TWO COPS to peel her off. Pamela furious. Jim is gracious with everyone, signs patiently, talks, kisses, shakes hands with the boys, lets them touch his hair, his body, poses for a picture, seems to like it. \nDOORS SONG For if we don't find the next little girl I tell you we must die I tell you I tell you I tell you we must die \nINT. CBS BACKSTAGE - THAT EVENING \nThe nervous PRODUCER, HERB, leading \"MR. SULLIVAN\" thru the corridor to the Doors' DRESSING ROOM past several \"ACTS\" getting ready to go on... animals, tumblers, a soprano wailing... \nPRODUCER Right this way Mr. Sullivan. They're called \"the Doors\". They got the number one single in the country -- \"Light Your Fire\". \nSULLIVAN \"Light Your Fire\"? Is that sooo? \nPRODUCER They look pretty grungy but we're... \nINT. DOORS DRESSING ROOM - EVENING \nBedlam. MAKE-UP ARTISTS pancaking the faces of the DOORS -- the nightmare coming true. RAY in a white suit with too many pinstripes. ROBBIE a spearmint turtleneck, beads, long sideburns, JOHN in red velveteen head to foot with a tie-dye splotch on the front of it. Their hair's being violated enough by a nervous gay black HAIR DESIGNER to make them totally self-conscious and nervous about their first live TV appearance -- all except JIM who remains in his signature black leather with the silver navajo belt and shiny spangles -- watching a portable TV... A GIRL leaving his side, crossing Pamela. Eye contact between them speaks of Pamela's jealousy. \nJOHN (indignant) You're gonna cut it! \nHAIRDRESSER (doing John) No, I'm going to worship it. What kind of shampoo are you using? \nJOHN The kind you get in hotels. \nHAIRDRESSER Pamper yourself sweetheart, you don't want split ends, you're a celebrity now. (moving to Ray) You have very serious-serious hair, it needs to rebel. I'll give it a tinge of something freaky. \nRAY I'd rather stay the same color. \nHAIRDRESSER Scaredy cat. \nROBBIE What about me? \nHAIRDRESSER (a look) Honey, we don't have enough time. \nTELEVISION INSERT -- images of DETROIT burning, summer of \nTV NEWSMAN ...here in Detroit, 42 people dead, more than 2000 injured... 1400 buildings burned, 5000 people have just lost their homes as Detroit joins more than 100 cities torn by riots this hot summer! \nOn JIM, as they pancake him, reflective. \nJIM No wonder \"Light My Fire's\" number one. \nHAIRDRESSER (to JIM) What about you handsome? \nJIM (friendly) The biggest mistakes in my life have been haircuts. \nPAM Don't wash it. Don't set it. He likes it the way it is... \nHAIRDRESSER (backing off) All right, be mean... \nCommotion from the doorway as the PRODUCER leads the lock- jawed MR. SULLIVAN in with everyone bowing and scraping to the Pope. \nPRODUCER Boys -- meet Mr. Sullivan \nMr. Sullivan waves from the doorway. \nSULLIVAN Hi boys, heard your song \"Light That Fire\" (Herb corrects) ...think you're great... good luck out there. \nJIM Maybe you're the cause! \nPAM Right. \nJIM I mean I don't have this problem with anybody else. \nPAM (getting the bottle) Give it to me!!! \nJIM (getting it back) No!!!!! Mommy!!! \nPAM (gives up, tries to exit) Fuck you man I'm outta here. \nHe grabs her. They lurch, smashing the lamp. WILD CHILD song kicking in. \nJIM (excited now) Get mad! Yeahhh! Love my girl! Yeah, go fuck the other guys. How many white guys have you fucked Pam? 10, 20? Black guys what? You like Chinese dicks? Mongolian penis? 30? \nPAM (fighting) ...how many dogs have you fucked! You don't say No to anybody! Drugs, dogs, uglies, you'd fuck a doorknob with butter on it! \nJIM How could I do that \nPAM (shouting top of her lungs) You're the first one who couldn't make it with me anyway! You're the only limp dick in the lot!!! \nCamera running at them from the end of the room. JIM laughs manically as they roll off the bed into a wall. Kicking, hitting hard. \nDOORS SONG Wild Child full of grace Savior of the human race Your cool face Natural child, terrible child Not your mother or your father's child Your own child, screaming wild \nJIM HA HA HA!! WILL YOU DIE FOR ME! \nPAM NO! WILL YOU DIE FOR ME!! \nJIM I'D DIE FOR ANYBODY. \nPAM WHAT ABOUT ME! WHAT ABOUT ME! \nJIM CUNT CUNT CUNT. \nPAM LIAR LIAR LIAR. YOU PROMISED. YOU PROMISED. \nJIM I'M SORRY I'M SORRY I'M SORRY. \nA VOICE across the wall joining in, banging. \nVOICE SHADDUP WILLYA. I'M TRYING TO SLEEP!!!! \nJIM THEN MOVE TO MIAMI YOU SLAVE!!! \nMore nagging. By this time the fight has expired of its own volition. \nJIM (quietly) You were saying? \nThey giggle, start to laugh. Then they cuddle on the floor, in the corner, in this semi-lit New York hotel room. \nJIM (low) ...will you die for me, Pam, a clown, a despicable clown?... a mere despicable clown? \nPAM Yes yes yes. \nJIM ...I need a home. A place to hide. \nPAM ...with me. Yes... yes... \nJIM (mumbling) ...how could we make a home?... where there's sanctuary? \nPAM ...yes, yes, yes. \nHe's hard now. She's guiding him inside her. \nJIM ...we're in Africa, we're just animals... I wanna stay inside you all night baby... let's fuck death away, now fuck death away... \nPAM ...yes... \nINT. PRESS CONFERENCE - HOTEL SUITE NEW YORK - DAY \nCamera moving in past the buffet, champagne, flowers in the hotel suite overlooking CENTRAL PARK... to the DOORS in armchairs surrounded by an informal group of a DOZEN JOURNALISTS and PRESS PHOTOGRAPHERS... JIM behind dark shades drinking long Hawaiian fruit punches, decked out in snakeskin. \nJOURNALIST 1 (stiff, Times type) What are your songs about Mr. Morrison? \nTIME DISSOLVES over the questions and answers. A vaguely dreamy quality. \nJIM Uh love death travel... revolt. We all write the songs, we're interested in anything about disorder, chaos, especially activity which seems to have no meaning... I think when you make peace with authority, you become authority. \nJOURNALIST 1 Can you define that a little more? \nJIM Yeah you can call us erotic politicians I guess. \nDISSOLVING OVER: \nJOURNALIST 2 Do you really consider yourself a shaman Mr. Morrison? \nDISSOLVING OVER: \nJIM ...a scapegoat maybe -- I take on the audiences' fantasies, obeying their impulses. When the impulses are destructive, I'm destructive. It's kinda like sucking the puss out of a rattlesnake, something like that. \nJOURNALIST 1 (smiling) ...like a medicine man or witch doctor? \nRAY (cuts in) Jim said to me once, the history of rock and roll's like Greek drama or caveman stories. The audience comes to see ancient rituals in ancient caves. Their souls in jeopardy. They're not watching any longer, they're participating -- and everything's in play, your life, your death... \nJOURNALIST 1 (glib) Is that why they scream so much? \nGentle laughter. The JOURNALISTS don't get it... panning their looks. The backbeat of CRYSTAL SHIP, dreamy hazy, Warhol- like interview floating over the room like a giant mushroom cloud. \nJIM Great! A new thing. \nAs she goes to a bowl of cocaine, laid alongside a bottle of champagne and a basketful of items all catered by Jim. He's at her bookcase, thumbing through an ancient manuscript. \nJIM Wow how old is this? \nINSERT -- the DRAWINGS in the book pertain to Witchcraft. \nPATRICIA (snorting) 14th Century. I practice the Craft. \nJIM The Craft? \nPATRICIA I'm a witch (smiles) A white one. \nJIM (impressed) Wow! You Patricia? Who would've guessed? \nIronic of course when you look at her long dark locks and demeanor. She looks back at him, challenging. \nPATRICIA The Kennealy's were Celtic cheiftains and pre-Christian shamans when your Druid ancestors the Morrisons were a minor Scottish clan founded by a bastard son of the king of Norway. \nJIM reappraising her. Her eye contact is very direct. \nPATRICIA It's a religion, witchcraft. Witches are the protectors of the seasons, the harvests, goddesses of the grain. And when crossed, destroyers. \nJim waits. Something in the feeling of the room has shifted. The sound of her razor chopping coke. He snorts -- the first time. \nPATRICIA You ever try drinking blood? \nJIM What? \nPATRICIA It works you know. You drink blood the right time of the moon... they used to dance in the forests naked. I think that's what offended the Puritans and led to the Burnings. They were a sexual threat to their male order like the Bacchae -- five days a year for Dionysus, they used to wander the hills in ancient Greece, the first witches, clans of wild women fucking, looting, eating animals raw, the wine in their blood running hot -- looking for Dionysus... to tear him to pieces -- isn't that wild? \nJim is down on his knees crawling around her. She is crawling back. \nJIM (hooked) Where do you get the blood? \nPatricia laughs. \nSUPERIMPOSITION TO: \nPATRICIA drawing blood from her arm -- wipes it on his mouth. Some of it spills out, tamping the white powder with red stains. Jim watching enthralled, coked out. She hands him the jewelled Moroccan dagger. \nPATRICIA Blood is the rose of mysterious union, symbol of potency... now you. \nJIM No... I don't like... cutting myself. \nPATRICIA (stern) Don't be such a child! If I do it, you have to do it. \nHe extends his arm. The look between them. He closes his eyes like a little boy. She makes the cut. \nDOORS SONG Before you slip into unconsciousness I'd like to have another kiss Another flashing chance at bliss Another kiss, another kiss \nSUPERIMPOSITIONS: \nCandles, incense burn. As Jim and Patricia dance in the loft naked to music, drinking champagne. \nJUMP CUT: He is chasing her with one of her goat horns between his legs. They wrestle, yell, lusty bacchanale. \nSUPERIMPOSITIONS TO: \nThey're fucking madly on the wooden floor of the loft, bathed in blood and white powder all over the place, rain pelting the windows, thunder, Orff's \"Carmina Burana\" cutting in over the Doors' song. \nPATRICIA (sexy) Come on rock god, fuck me, fuck me good. \nIn slightly ape-like SLOW MOTION, he's wildly thrusting at her like a stallion, then reaches down, yanks out her diaphragm -- holds it to her eyes briefly and throws it across the room into the fireplace. \nJIM (lips out of sync) I'm gonna burn you down. \nPATRICIA Come on... \nIncants him to climax with CELTIC WORDS. \nJim is wild, reaching for the Moroccan dagger, holding it to her face as he continues to pump. \nPATRICIA Cut me! Cut me go on! \nJIM (knife to her cheek) Nobody'd ever look at you again -- 'cept me. I'd scar you forever. \nPATRICIA Yeah YEAH! \nJIM AWRIGHT! AWRIGHT! \nPATRICIA FUCK ME! FUCK ME!! GO ON FUCK ME!!! \nDOORS SONG The crystal ship is being filled A thousand girls, a thousand thrills A million ways to spend your time When we get back I'll drop a line \nThe camera shooting up to the ceiling in a tilting dutch angle as the world comes unglued. Jim yelling with release. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. PHOTOGRAPHIC STUDIO - NEW YORK - ANOTHER DAY \nGLORIA STAVERS, beautiful 30ish ex-Vogue model shooting Jim for her layout. It's not going well. He's resisting, the attitude negative to be photographed, compounded by the acid it seems he's on. \nGLORIA Take off your shirt. \nJIM (cow noise) Mooooooo!!! \nGLORIA (taking his shirt off) You remind me of a Russian peasant. I see you standing in a wheat field. The pride, the arrogance. You love to look at yourself don't you. You love yourself. (he's moving, getting into it) ...good... big cat stalking... \nJim shakes his head, weary. Suddenly he's scared inside. \nJIM You're wrong. What they want I can't give... my death -- ripped to pieces -- do you feel their power? (the noise pounding) \nPATRICIA You have no choice, Jim. I see you up there like Icarus. I see you flying closer and closer to the sun. And your wings are melting... \nJIM I want to live, Patricia. I don't wanna die. \nJim's ironic eyes, to the ceiling. Laden with a power to which he has married himself yet brave, resisting as she pulls his zipper down and goes to her knees in front of him. Shaking his head. \nJIM Patricia... Patricia... \nA beefy COP stands there looking at them, \nCOP Whatcha doing there? \nJIM Uh... nuthin' \nCOP (approaching, suspicious) Okay, outta there both of you. No one's allowed backstage. Let's go. \nPATRICIA You idiot, don't you know who... \nJIM Hey, I'm with the band man. It's cool. Take it easy. \nTHE COP has no patience, grabs JIM by the arm and pulls. JIM shoves him off. THE COP pushes back. A shoving match. \nCOP Let's go. NOW! You're both under arrest. \nJIM (pointing to his crotch, angry) Hey, eat it man! \nThe cop whips out a black can from his belt, sprays Jim. \nJIM Mace! Shit! (in pain) \nPatricia screaming at the COP grabs JIM, propelling him violently out the stall of the bathroom. \nINT. BACKSTAGE CORRIDOR - SAME NIGHT \nPATRICIA Help! They got Jim!!! \nJIM Why'd you blind me man? You blinded me! \nSIDDONS and RAY running up with ROADIES and OTHERS. \nSIDDONS What the hell happened! (to Jim) Don't touch Jim. Get some water. Don't touch your eyes. \nJIM (in pain) I BEEN BLINDED MAN. I BEEN MACED. \nCOP (realizing) Hey all he said was... \nSIDDONS He was WHAT! He's Jim Morrison for chrissake. Jim, Jim -- you okay -- let's get you under the water here. Don't touch, you'll be okay. \nCOP 2 comes up. \nCOP 1 I'm going to have to issue a warrant for his arrest. \nSIDDONS Are you NUTS! (blocking them) \nJIM guided back into the shower stall by his entourage, eyes blind as Oedipus, starts to laugh. A black Irish laugh. \nRay looking on PATRICIA in the hallway. A beat, senses what happened. \nRAY Why don't you leave him alone lady, he doesn't need more shit in his life. \nPATRICIA What do you know what Jim needs? \nA precise military Drum Beat hits as we launch into \"The Unknown Soldier\". \nDOORS SONG ...Hup two -- three -- four... COMPANY HALT! \nINT. NEW HAVEN STAGE - THAT NIGHT \nTHE DOORS on stage, JIM - eyes masked, facing death at a mock execution, in full black leather armor. \nDOORS SONG Present arms!... \nThe famous drum roll, tension building. Sudden sound of guitar. Jim crumples to the ground. Blood shooting from his mouth. \nJIM & DOORS Make a grave for the unknown soldier Nestled in your hollow shoulder The unknown soldier Practice as the news is read Television children dead Bullet strikes the helmet's head It's all over The war is over! \nThe audience is enrapt. Jim suddenly jumps up, looses the blood curdling scream of an aroused demon and the band bangs into Willie Dixon's BACK DOOR MAN. \nJIM & DOORS OH YEEEEAAAAHHHHHHHHHH! AYYYYYYAAAAAMMMMAAA BACK DOOR MAN. \nThe FANS go wild, to the farthest reaches of the arena, as he grabs his crotch and shakes it at them. INSTAMATICS flashing rapidly as the KIDS press forward at Jim fondling the mike stand, sliding up and down its smooth shaft. \nJIM & DOORS Well the men don't know But the little girls unnerstan'... \nJoints sail onto the stage at his feet, ready to be smoked. A TEENAGE BOY & GIRL make a break thru the cordon of COPS at the front of the stage, heading for Jim. The Cops chase them down mid-stage, and wrestle them back to the edge -- throwing them back into the audience. \nJIM & DOORS When all the good people are trying to sleep I'm out there making my midnight creep Yeah, cause I'm a backdoor man The men don't know But the little girls unnerstan'... \nDanger fills the air, electric. Jim strutting, Indian like, up to one of the Cops, whipping off his hat and flipping it to the Crowd, which roars with approval. A couple Cops looking at Jim, sensing they're being challenged but not sure how. They shuffle and look offstage for direction. Their apparent impotence brings redoubled jeering from the Kids. \nRAY, next to his stick of incense on the organ, shares a look with JOHN as they head into the instrumental break in the song. There's something different about Jim -- more demonic, more driven -- a spirit has taken him over. \nRAY'S POV -- JIM catching his look, but no recognition in those eyes. They're dark pools, like Warhol's eyes. He turns away, taking the mike and off the cuff rapping improvisationally with the backbeat, keeping poetic meter. \nJIM I wanna tell you 'bout something that happened just a few minutes ago right here in New Haven. This is New Haven isn't it? New Haven, Connecticut, United States of America? \nRAY (aside to Robbie) He could go all the way man! In five years he could be in the White House. Another JFK. \nRobbie's look tells us he thinks Ray is as much caught up in his dreams as Jim. \nCUT TO: \nFLASHBULBS hits us full frame as: \nINT. MUG SHOT - LIMBO \nA reminder of the reality as the thud of a clanking gate shuts. MORRISON's profile, disheveled hair -- he glares angrily. \nFLASH! \nFRONTAL SHOT, slated Police Dept -- New Haven Conn -- 23750 -- 12-10-67. A sullen handsome portrait. \nINT. RECORDING STUDIO - (LAST SESSION) - LOS ANGELES NIGHT \nJIM drinks... an ugly cough. Silence. In this puffy wrack and ruin there is still the ironic tones and sweet delight of the boy amazed and amused by it all. We hear the ghostly CROWD still cheering. \nJIM I drink so I can talk to assholes. This includes me. Let's just say I was testing the bounds of reality -- that's-all -- I was curious... I kinda always preferred to be hated. Like Erich Von Stroheim in the movies... the man you loved to hate... it's meant to be ironic, courage wants to laugh. Y'know it's essentially a stupid situation. I go out on a stage and I howl for people. In me they see what they want to see -- some say the Lizard King, whatever that means, or some black-clad leather demon whatever that means... but really I think of myself as a sensitive, intelligent human being but with the soul of a clown which always forces me to blow it at the most crucial moment... (pause) a fake hero... a joke the gods played on me... it's okay, I accept the joke... and smile. Death old friend, death and my cock, I can forgive my injuries in the name of wisdom, luxury, romance. Words got me the wound and will get me well. All join now in lament of my cock, a tongue of knowledge in the feathered night. Boys get crazy in the head and suffer. I sacrifice my cock on the alter of silence. \nThe ENGINEER looking at him puzzled. Has Jim lost it? MIKE, his friend, is there in the Engineer's booth, with the Door's SECRETARY, Leticia, and an elegant MYSTERY WOMAN. They're smoking dope, partying. \nMIKE Hey Jim, how 'bout hitting a strip- joint? It's getting late and we can... \nJIM Nah, later... \nThe violent backbeat of THE WASP now picking up. \nJIM Now listen to this I'll tell you about Texas Radio and the big beat soft driven slow and mad like some new language reaching your head with the cold sudden fury of a divine messenger let me tell you about heartache and the loss of God wandering, wandering in hopeless night out here on the perimeter there are no stars out here we is stoned, immaculate... but I tell you this: No eternal reward will forgive us now for wasting the dawn. \nEXT. LOS ANGELES - DAWN (1968) \nJIM walks the dawn streets. Classic image -- jeans, boots, jacket, the sun starting to rise on the smog and translucent pink light along Santa Monica Boulevard outside the cheap Alta Cienega Motel where he lives... PEACE FROG shoots us through. \nDOORS SONG Blood in the streets in the town of New Haven Blood stains the roofs and palm trees of Venice Blood in my love in the terrible summer The bloody red sun of phantastic L.A. \nOver the SONG, a MONTAGE of the 60's passing to its darker side. \nDOCUMENTARY IMAGES \nMARTIN LUTHER KING assassinated, BOBBY KENNEDY gunned down, PEGGY FLEMMING ice skating at the Olympics; A QUAKER burns himself to death protesting the war in Vietnam; B-52 bombs dropped on CAMBODIA; KENT STATE erupts; CHARLES MANSON is arrested. \nINT. BARNEY'S BEANERY - LOS ANGELES - MONDAY \nJIM -- drinking in Barney's Bar. \nHEADLINE READS: \n\"KANSAS COPS SLAM DOORS; CONCERT CANCELLED,\" 2nd HEADLINE: \"DOORS 3RD ALBUM OUT, SALES UP, MAGIC DOWN.\" \nDissolve to CRITIC'S FACE. Back to Jim's face. Superimpositions over it of: \nNEWS FLASHES \nLYNDON JOHNSON's dog face on TV withdrawing: NIXON waving as he wins '68; Rowen and Martin's LAUGH IN; COLUMBIA STUDENTS taking over; 3rd HEADLINE: \"MORRISON BUSTED IN VEGAS\". MARTIN LUTHER KING going down again; NIXON winning; massive ANTI- WAR PROTESTS in Washington; floating space ships in \"2001\"; B-52s sailing over Vietnam 4th HEADLINE: \"DOORS PROVOKE CHICAGO RIOTS\" -- again and again, faster, faster. \nDOORS SONG Blood is the rose of mysterious union! There's blood in the streets & it's up to my knees She came Blood in the streets of Chicago She came Blood on the rise and it's following me Just about the break of day (etc) The river runs red down the legs of the city She came The women are crying red rivers of weeping \nThe MONTAGE collides into an ECU on JIM -- drinking as if to silence the images, the sounds we hear and see on his face. Spirits crying for release. In alcoholic solace. He passes out, head hitting the bar. \nJim's English friend, MIKE, walks in, throwing a harsh shaft of LA morning light across the dark bar and JIM's face, bleary eyed, passed out on the counter. He has a drinking paunch. With him are TOM BAKER, \"TOM\", the actor from the Warhol scene in New York and a huge biker type drinker named DOG, one of Jim's roadmen, a beard fanning his chest, tattoos everywhere. In the front of these three monoliths are about twenty beer bottles, numerous Jack Daniels bottles emptied and a lesbian BARTENDRESS pouring up a breakfast shot of bloody Marys... Mike hands Dog a breakfast in a brown paper bag. \nMIKE Morning. Pour me breakfast Delores... \nDelores pouring the bloody mary. As Mike scoffs at Jim passed out. \nMIKE Whatsa matter with Jimbo? Can't handle it huh (studying the beer bottles for leftovers) \nTOM Pussy whipped, man... \nDOG reaching in, dragging Jim's face up by the hair. Sticks Mike's greasy eggs and bacon in front of Jim. \nDOG Hey Jim, come on babe, eat this. . . one last place to go. Ray's getting it on. \nJim is suddenly alert -- an instant and surprising transformation, without hangover, eager eyed. \nJIM (sparkling) Alive she cried! Right Dog, another cubic centimeter of chance (slaps Dog, notices the eggs, queasy) Ugh, I can't eat this stuff, it'll really make me sick. Gimme a Dos Equis will ya Delores? And a Ramos gin fizz with it. \nTOM Fuck man did you fade or what, we were on a \"death run\" up to the 9000 building after the gig, you bet me a grand you'd walk the ledge. \nJIM (instantly) Let's go... Right now! \nTOM Then mumbling about \"gotta go home, sanctuary,\" pussy whipped. We were gonna film it! A thousand bucks! (to Delores) Give him a double. \nJIM A triple, Tom, shem and shaun... \nTOM ...imagine me and Morrison in a fuckin movie together, can you imagine two powerful two-fisted Irish fucking drinking guys in a movie, in a documentary movie!! \nMIKE I'll direct the shit out of it, man. Dennis Hopper can do it, I can do it. \nJIM (drinking the fizz down) ...all of us direct it! In black and white. Call it \"Zero.\" A real road movie! Two of these (points to drink) you feel a lot better. \nAs he pisses on the floor next to the bar stool. \nDOG Whatcha doing! Oh fuck. \nDELORES Fuck you Morrison. You're outta here you fuckhead, get out! \nPAM And you're gonna change those stinky leathers you been wearing for three weeks. \nJIM I don't know 'bout that. \nPAM What the hell are you on? \nJIM Uh -- just some low grade acid. It's not heavy. (whispers) Pam, read my mind. \nPAM Jesus Jim! Goddamit! You PROMISED. I made the duck! People are coming! Ray and Dorothy think we're flaky enough and I... you said you'd wait till after, you're going to peak before me. \nJIM Hey it's okay, it's okay... come on, we'll trip and then eat our feast. \nPAM Yeah sure. \nPutting down the bags at their porch, pausing. He moves to her, kisses her, conciliatory and gentle. \nJIM Come on baby, y'know it's a good thing for Ray and Dorothy I think women are such noble creatures -- they carry on your name with dignity after you die. (spawning like minnows) \nPAM What are you saying? You wanna marry me Jim? \nJIM (elusively) I think women basically have a comic approach to life -- I mean how can they not when they look up in the dark and see a dangling penis, seeking entry. It looks like a face y'know -- little beard \"Hi mom\" (Pam giggling now) I wanna get inside you. Look around. (humming) \"Do the funky chicken, do dah, dah, funky chicken do da da \"love my girl\" -- \nShe's cracking up now. As he takes the acid out, holds it in front of her like a sacrament. \nJIM Let's go wild child, let's get out there Romeo and Juliet, Marilyn Monroe and Vincent Van Gogh, Jim and Pam, rock and roll (a poem) ...all the poetry has wolves in it, but one Pam -- the most beautiful one of all -- dances in a ring of fire and throws off the challenge with a shrug \nAs she takes the tablet on her tongue, swallows. \nPAM (romantic) I like it when you sing to me \nJIM 'cause I'm the poet and you're my muse \nStrains of YOU'RE LOST, LITTLE GIRL drift in, setting a more ominous tone. \nINT. JIM AND PAM'S HOUSE - LAUREL CANYON - THAT DAY \nThe FOOD is laid out, the DUCK cooking... but no one is there as we move across this tastefully decorated house to PAMELA in the living room, rattled, obsessively going through Jim's papers. PEOPLE are knocking at the door. Guests looking through the windows, tapping. A giant poster of Marilyn Monroe frames Pamela. \nPAM What am I going to do about these papers! Jim, Jim -- you really need someone to organize this stuff. Your handwriting's just like a little kid. \nJim is somewhere else -- pulling out the DUCK which is totally charred black. He laughs. \nPAM My God look at this. I wonder if William Blake was ever this disorganized. \nRAY and DOROTHY walking in. ROBBIE and JOHN general commotion. Dorothy immediately seeing the duck, runs to it... \nDOROTHY Oh the duck! \nJIM (coming over) Get some drinks, man. Over there (getting Pam's attention) Pam! \nPAM I'm gonna be your editor now, seriously I'm going to organize all your stuff. I'm gonna take out all the fuck words. \nDOORS SONG You're lost little girl You're lost little girl You're lost, tell me Who are you? \nPEOPLE are introducing themselves, coming in from all over, like in a shoebox. Hippies. Doors people... now TOM BAKER with MIKE and DOG... Now an aggressive Chuck Berry type BLACK SINGER with John's GIRLFRIEND. Then a TIMOTHY LEARY look- alike appears. CHATTER blending everywhere as we build to a vast confusion at Jim and Pam's party. \nJIM Let's go wild child, let's get out there Romeo and Juliet, Marilyn Monroe and Vincent Van Gogh, Jim and Pam, rock and roll (a poem) \"Clothed in sunlight Restless in wanting Dying of fever Changed shapes of an empire Vast promissory notes of joy How it has changed you How slowly estranged you Solely arranged you Beg you for mercy\" \nAs she takes the tablet on her tongue, swallows. \nJIM (cupping her chin) Pam... Honey, you're trying too hard. \nPAM I'm not -- I'm not. \nJIM (soft, reassuring) Yes you are. \nPAM There's some great poetry here Jim, some wonderful ideas. \nJIM Yeah but nobody wants to read poetry anymore, nobody cares, it's not like important y'know. Just put it away. Not right now. \nPAM (lost) But what am I supposed to do? How do I fit in? Who am I supposed to be around all these people? \nThe FRENCH COUNT coming in now, from the Warhol party in New York. They're looking at her, embarrassing as everyone overhears. \nCOUNT Darling Pamela, I brought you a little something. \nJIM (ignoring it) You're my girl, that's who... \nPAMELA (laughs insanely) I'm not your girl, don't give me that shit. I know you fuck everything that touches you. \nOnly in life would ANNE O'RIORDAN walk in at this precise moment, a smile on her face. Ray's eyes roll. \nANNE Hi Jim... (waiting for the introduction to Pam) \nJIM (to Pamela) All right so I do. I live my life the way I want. I don't want anyone expecting anything from me -- including you! You don't like it then get the fuck out! (to Anne) Oh hi Anne. You know Pam? She's a little pissed off right now but... \nRAY Okay Jim let's eat that duck. \nDOROTHY (calming Pamela) Come on Pam, let's put out the plates... \nPAMELA (stunned, pushing thru to Anne) Anne O'Riordan. Are you Anne O'Riordan? \nANNE You must be Pamela \nPAMELA (eyeing her up and down through her tears) You actually put your dick in this woman Jim? \nJIM Well I... sometimes yeah \nPAMELA (condescending to Anne) I understand... I really do but don't ever think that Jim's gonna love you or take care of you. You're one of a hundred you know \nExiting with the other Doors... Dog picking the duck up from the floor. \nDOG Hey, fuck him, let's eat this thing. \nPamela is sobbing, in a quiet bewildered voice, repeating to herself. \nPAM What the hell's happened to us Jim? What the hell is happening to us. There's some great poetry... \nOn Jim... saddened. \nDOORS SONG You're lost little girl (2) You're lost, tell me Who are you? \nINT. TUNNEL - OUTDOOR THEATRE - NIGHT \nThe backbeat of NOT TO TOUCH THE EARTH as a DOCUMENTARY FILM CREW, moves past us directed by MIKE and DOG and TOM shoot past us, sun guns, nagras (\"Rolling! Speed!\") then... \nA mad rush of HANDS and SCREAMS as SHAPES whip by under swinging light-bulbs -- big BLACK BODYGUARDS, six or seven of them, bulling their way thru the grasping faces, as MORRISON appears... camera swinging wildly with him to reveal: \nEXT. ARENA - (ANY CITY) - NIGHT \nTHOUSANDS OF FANS roaring \"DOORS! DOORS! DOORS!\" \nVOICE (loudspeaker) Ladies and Gentlemen, from Los Angeles California -- The DOORS! \nSIDDONS (in crush) Jim! Your Mom's here with your brother. What do you want me to do with 'em? \nJIM (shakes his head) HIDE ME!!! \nHARD CUT TO: \nMadness. COPS lining the edge of the stage, looking worried. As Jim throws his leather jacket into the cheering crowd and does the ghost dance around the microphone, Indian style, one foot, resurrecting the dead, the power of the circle. The stage is bottom lit, Dantean in look. The Doors casting giant shadows of heroic proportions. DEA AGENTS in suits and short hair take photos from the front of the stage, clipboards in hand. Blocked by a row of cops, it is impossible for Jim to communicate with his audience. \nJIM & DOORS There's been a slaughter here Don't stop to speak or look around Your gloves and fan are on the ground We're getting out of town we're going on the run And you're the one I want to come Not to touch the earth Not to see the sun Nothing left to do But run, run, run Let's run, let's run... \nSIDDONS yelling at MIKE, the roadie. \nSIDDONS Vice Squad says one more \"fuck or shit\" they're gonna close us down man. \nMIKE Stick my dick in their ear! \nJim ignoring all this, one hand cupped to his ear listening for the sound of the earth, gone into a shaman-like state, weird spiralling chords carrying over the following MONTAGE of hallucinatory insanity. \nJIM & DOORS House upon the hill Moon is lying still... \nEXT. JIM & PAM'S HOUSE - LAUREL CANYON - NIGHT \nA POV up at the house -- into which JIM enters. The lights are on. Sage at the door sniffing. \nINT. JIM & PAM'S HOUSE - LAUREL CANYON - NIGHT \nJIM & DOORS Shadows of the trees witnessing the wild breeze Come on baby run with me Run with me, let's run... \nJIM'S POV entering the bedroom -- PAMELA naked in bed with the COUNT, is snorting heroin. Shadows of the trees and leaves blowing against the walls. Their voices, dim, distant. \nJIM (ironic) Oh hi... I didn't realize you were entertaining. \nPAM (stoned) Hi. \nShe sits up on the bed, wobbly. The COUNT, more sophisticated in these things, lights a cigarette from the bedside table, revealing heroin paraphernalia. \nCOUNT Scusi Jimmy, I hope you're cool about this... \nJIM (very cool) Don't forget your smack on the way out. \nEXT. ARENA - CONCERT \nJim's struggling to break through the barrier of cops. \nJIM (yelling) The mansion is warm at the top of the hill Rich are the rooms and the comforts there Red are the arms of luxuriant chairs You won't know a thing till you get inside \nBACK TO: \nINT. JIM & PAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe COUNT is gone. JIM, icy cold, grabs PAM by the wrist. \nJIM I told you about that shit. Or are we talking about death choices here? \nPAM I'm just doing my thing, just like you said, it's my thing, why can't I have a thing. Ow! You're hurting me! \nJIM (rising anger) Get up. Hurt? You want to know HURT? Let me introduce you to my good friend hurt. \nHe is on her, throws her from the bed. She runs and hides in the closet, slamming the door behind her. \nPAM (screaming) NO FUCK YOU! THIS IS MY... \nJIM (crazed) Ah sanctuary!... a soft place to hide. \nPAM (inside) ...from you, you pig! \nAs he picks up a can of lighter fluid and douses the closet door and the floor. \nJIM I'll give you a place to hide forever! \nWe INTERCUT with PAM inside the closet yelling for mercy inside. \nPAM JIM! \nHe puts a candle to the drenched door/floor. \nEXT. ALTA CIENEGA MOTEL ROOM - SAME DAY \nPAM's mascara is running from her eyes, begging to get in. The BLACK MAID cleaning the adjacent room overheard, unsurprised. \nPAM Jim, I gotta talk! Let me in please. I gotta talk. \nJIM Now Pam sweetheart, I'm busy. \nPamela listening at the door. She's on the second story of a cheap motel overlooking a boring parking lot on the edge of La Cienega. \nPAM Jim, I know there's someone in there, I can't believe you're doing this again. You're disgusting. \nINTERCUTS TO: \nINT. MOTEL ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS \nJIM Well you see Pam there's this crazy girl in here, she's just lying on the bed with her legs open and I don't know what to do. \nPAM FUCK YOU!!! I want to see her. \nJIM (off) It's your cousin Lizzie, you don't want to see her. Go home. \nPAM We're all sisters, let me see her. Jim,... I got this wonderful leg of lamb in the oven for supper... and the house is immaculate. Sage is waiting. He wants you to play with him... are you coming... \nJIM Almost. \nPAM Jim goddamit answer me!! (no answer, she yells) JIM! I FUCKED HIM TO HURT YOU! HE DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING TO ME!! \nPEOPLE in the parking lot looking up. A silence is her only response. She waits, turns away from the closed door as TOUCH ME BABE cuts in: \nDOORS SONG C'mon, c'mon, c'mon c'mon now Touch me babe Can't you see that I am not afraid \nINT. RECORDING STUDIO - THAT NIGHT \nIn the VOCAL BOOTH, JIM is chugging on a brown paper bag with whiskey in it, crooning with heart but the voice is warped, weak. \nJIM What was that promise you made Why don't you tell me what she said What was that promise that she made I'm gonna love you Till the heaven stops the rain I'm gonna love you Till the stars fall from the sky For you and I... \nVARIOUS PEOPLE are hanging around the studio listening -- a couple of HIPPIE CHICKS, A BURN VICTIM w/ bandages, a CHARLES MANSON TYPE, a Siberian HUSKY, the TIM LEARY type. Paper bags, burgers, bottles, California rose, apple juice, hard- boiled eggs. \nIn the ENGINEERING BOOTH. ROTHCHILD, the producer, is displeased. \nPAUL (to Botnick the engineer) ...fuckin' neanderthal primadonna is too drunk to see. (cuts the music, to Jim) Cut it... that was beautiful sweetheat, we had a technical problem, we'll take it again from the top babe whenever you're ready. \nOn the floor, the DOORS are depressed. DENSMORE looking at MORRISON, aimlessly, nervously. KRIEGER looking tired and beaten, takes a discreet hit on a joint. Ray scans an art book, patient. \nDENSMORE What's his fucking problem? \nJIM (equally false) Paul babe. \nPAUL Right here baby. \nJIM Why don't you suck a fart out of my asshole you slave driving facist motherfucker! \nAs he stalks out of the booth. Raging, near-incomprehensible. \nA small portable TV set is playing the \"Dean Martin Show\" low on one end of the recording console. Around the room the detritus of the time -- Mailer's \"Armies of the Night\", The Stone's \"Beggar's Banquet\", Janis' \"Cheap Thrills\", Traffic, The Band. \nPAUL (exasperated) I hear the booze, I hear the smokes Jim, I don't hear the voice and babe I didn't hear the song! \nJIM So what are we going to tonight Paul! 67 takes! It's stale! \nRAY (coming in with JOHN) Alright, let's try something else. \nJIM I wanna sing blues. This stuffs getting too self-conscious. \nROBBIE (offended) Cause it's my song man? \nJIM (simultaneous, incomprehensible) Let's sing \"Rock is Dead\"! You're all a buncha slaves... \"Oh come all ye faithful.\" \nPAUL (hot) Shut up Jim! I don't understand! I don't. What are ya doing! I love you like a brother, I do, but why are you fucking this up. It's a perfect radio song for chrissake! No one wants to hear the blues anymore! Think like a singer, you're the only baritone crooner we got left... Sinatra, Elvis, Crosby, you're as good as they are, but WHY ARE YOU FUCKING THIS UP! WHY! \nPause. Jim's face darkening. Something he sees on the television. He stops, frozen, sickly. Several BIMBETTES are dancing around a shiny new automobile as strains of LIGHT MY FIRE pop out. \nJIM Catchy, you sold it to a commercial? \nRay, Siddons, Robbie, John, shuffling for a moment. \nJIM For that? How much did you get for it? \nRAY Now, Jim... \nJIM HOW MUCH? \nSIDDONS It was $50,000. You weren't talking to us that week and we figgered you... \nJIM You figured? What the fuck is this Ray? \nRAY It's not like a big deal Jim, the song's already been commercialized, the money was great. Robbie wrote the lyrics and he didn't mind, neither did I, neither did John... we gotta get to TV. \nJIM What?... are you saying? Are we the Doors? One for all and all for one? Do you know what you're saying to those millions of kids! \"Just kidding, not real\". That's what you're saying. \nJOHN Oh come on man, you think just cause you're the lead man in the band you can run the whole show. \nJIM (building intensity) You think I was kidding Ray? (turning to John) Hey John, those are interesting shoes, you like those shoes? \nPAMELA, looking drawn and pathetic finds this moment to walk into the studio. \nJOHN (aggressive) Yeah I do. \nINT. MIAMI AUDITORIUM - NIGHT (1969) \nCrammed into every available space of an old SEAPLANE HANGAR with no seats -- standing room only -- a MASS of KIDS swelter in the heat, grumbling, fanning themselves with programs as a warm-up BAND plays. \nIn the wings of the stage, a RADIO DJ/CRITIC is recording on tape. It's the same kid we saw long ago at the Whiskey backstage, pronouncing the arrival of the Doors on the scene. Now he's got a beard, glasses, a more cynical face. \nRADIO DJ/CRITIC (into microphone) A hot night in Miami January '69 -- every space in the auditorium is consumed... unfortunately the Doors have long since sold out. They've become an act. Morrison \"falls\" off the stage at least every other performance. \"The Soft Parade\" album only confirms the plasticity of their approach. Songs like \"Touch Me\" and \"Follow Me Down\" are not the Doors we once knew. So the question is: Why am I here? Are funerals entertainment? \nDENSMORE looks on from the stage wings, withdraws -- to RAY nearby. \nDENSMORE He ain't gonna show! I know it man. We should fuckin' go on without him. \nRAY Bill's with him. They're an hour away, he'll get him here. \nINT. NEW ORLEANS AIRPORT BAR - SAME NIGHT \nSIDDONS, the manager tugs on MORRISON who's getting soused with DOG, TOM, MIKE, and ROTHCHILD the producer. The P.A. SYSTEM announcing the departure of the Miami flight! \nSIDDONS Goddamit Jim! We missed one already, we gotta get this one man! \nJim slams has shot glass on the bar. He's got a beard for the first time, looking like a tribal elder. \nJIM More! \nMIKE Four more all around and up and down! \nAs the WAITRESS takes the order \nSIDDONS (urgent) NO! CUT EM OFF! CUT EM OFF! \nJIM Don't be so melodramatic Bill, it's not fun anymore. \nDOG I can't fly sober. \nSIDDONS Jim, you don't show for this one, we're dead, the whole group -- no more bookings. \nJIM I care. \nPAUL Come on Jim, we'll get fuckin' laid in Miami. \nSIDDONS We need the work Jim! They're making us post a $10,000 bond just to show up -- we're the only group in rock-n- roll with a fuck clause! (aside to Dog) Get him on the fuckin' plane. That's what I pay you for. \nDOG (to Bill) You're an awful little guy to be talking like that. \nJIM (muttering) Chump change, we're working for chump change. \nSIDDONS Look at you, you're a pathetic fuckin' slob and so are all your friends! \nJIM I got an idea Bill, you're fired. \nINTERCUT TO: \nINT. MIAMI AUDITORIUM - THAT NIGHT \nThe warm-up BAND is applauded and booed. The CROWD resembles a pit of snakes, wriggling on top of each other. Impatient CATCALLS. \nINT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT \nJOHN Listen to 'em! They're not coming for the music anymore. They're coming to see a fuckin' freak show! \nRAY You think it's easy for him. He moves left he's got vice squad, on the right narcs -- and the audience just waiting for him to get busted. \nJOHN He wanted it! Not us. I just don't fuckin' get the point anymore. I never did I guess. Y'ask me he's just become a drunken fuckin' asshole that's what. And he's gonna take us down with him. \nRAY Compassion was never your forte man. \nJOHN Don't lecture me Mr. Philosopher, you never felt a fuckin thing in your life. I loved that man. I loved what he was. \nRobbie strums his guitar, breaks the tension in the room. A lick of \"Five to One\". \nROBBIE It ain't the old Jim that's for sure. I think he's living for everybody else man and somewhere along the way he's lost his own self. \nRAY (almost to himself) The wine man, the ancient wine. The ancient wine. \nROBBIE What? \nRAY Something he once told us. About Dionysos. When the madness took over... \nINTERCUT TO: \nOMIT \nSequence omitted from original script. \nINT. AIRPLANE - THAT NIGHT \nThe STEWARDESS, uptight, tries a smile at JIM, TOM, MIKE all belted in one row. \nSTEWARDESS My name is Rita Hager and if... \nJIM If your name is Rita, then yor ol man must be ol man Rita!! (guffaws) \nTOM, MIKE & DOG (chorusing) That ol man Riva, he just keep rolling along! \nSTEWARDESS Excuse me sir, my father is not my old man. \nA BABY, with her MOTHER, stares at Jim fascinated. He lifts his dark glasses, winks back at her. \nTIMECUT TO: \nHe looks like he's really gonna tear it all off now. A flash of boxer shorts. RAY moving. SIDDONS moving. DOG getting to him first, wrapping him in a bearhug from behind, lifting him holding his pants up. \nVINCE THE ROADIE DON'T DO IT MAN. DON'T DO IT! \nRAY HEY JIM. \nJIM C'MON! C'MON! NO LIMITS, NO LAWS! NO LIMITS, NO LAWS! NO LIMITS, NO LAWS! \nThe place is in PANDEMONIUM now. GIRLS jumping on stage and dancing with Jim still in Vince the Roadie's bearhug. Another RIOT... COPS fighting the TEENAGERS off the stage, now wobbling under the weight. \nPROMOTER (pissed, head bandaged) GET OFF THE FUCKING STAGE! GET OFF THE FUCKING STAGE!! (stiffarms Jim off the stage) \nRAY starts playing BREAK ON THROUGH trying to keep things normal. \nJIM now out there in the arena in a CONGA LINE, doing his rain dance, hands on hips, the TEENAGERS forming a long snake behind him. \nThe huge speaker columns teeter and fall. A corner of the STAGE now COLLAPSES from the weight, PEOPLE spilling on the floor, screams. The power console tips over next to DENSMORE. He bails. Manzarek and Krieger follow. \nThe PROMOTER is yelling at SIDDONS about his insurance contract as the COPS and FBI AGENTS close in, looking for Jim. \nCOPS Where's the guy with the penis! \nWho is out there leading his naked drunken FLOCK, hundreds of them in a phallic Pied Piper dance thru the darkened seaplane hanger. From BREAK ON THROUGH PART TWO: \nJIM ET AL & DOORS You know the day destroys the night Night divides the day Try to run, try to hide BREAK ON THROUGH TO THE OTHER SIDE BREAK ON THROUGH TO THE OTHER SIDE BREAK ON THROUGH TO THE OTHER SIDE Dead cats! Dead rats! Did you see what they were at Dead cat in a top hat! Sucking on a young man's blood Fat cat in a top hat Thinks he's an aristocrat Thinks he can kill and slaughter Thinks he can shoot my daughter Dead cats! Dead rats! Think you're an aristocrat Crap, that's crap \nRay watching from the corner of the stage, littered with bras, bottles, shirts, shoes, socks, panties, hats, broken equipment, debris -- the end of the dream. The Doors as a live band are dead. \nDISSOLVING TO: \nINT. MIAMI COURTROOM - DAY (1970) \nThe \"Charges\" are being read by the JUDGE, distant, not of this world. The court is lit in southern gothic daylight, ghostly chiaroscuro, all colors bled. Camera moving along the sweaty white faces of the six older JURORS, all of them straight \"silent majority\"... past the PROSECUTOR, his shadow cutting the jury box... onto JIM bearded, smoking 2 packs a day, a deep racking cough, sitting with his elder ATTORNEY... RAY, ROBBIE, JOHN, PAMELA, OTHERS in support are there in background. The trial is going down like a morphine dream, Jim featured in diopter close-up. \nJUDGE VOICE ...you are charged under four counts with lewd behavior, simulated masturbation, public drunkenness, profanity, and public exposure. \nA blues riff goes by -- brief, ghostly from RUNNING BLUE. \nJIM SONG Poor Otis dead and gone Left me here to sing his song Pretty little girl with the red dress on Poor Otis dead and gone \nJIM (V.O.) I can't believe this is happening I can't believe all these people are sniffing each other & backing away, teeth grinning, hair raised, growling, here in the slaughtered wind This is it No more fun the death of all joy has come \nThe PRESS SECTION is full as Jim's older LAWYER argues in front of the JURY, a distant voice. \nLAWYER Your Honor, I would like to bring to the Court's attention the contemporary Broadway musical \"Hair\" in which cast members disrobe and appear naked on the stage. \nJUDGE (pounds his gavel) Inadmissable evidence. \nJIM VOICE OVER I had a vision of America Seen from the air 28,000 ft. & going fast A one-armed man in a Texas parking labyrinth A burnt tree like a giant primeval bird in an empty lot in Fresno \nSUPERIMPOSITION: \nLAWYER Your Honor... any difference from the Miami nightclubs where comedians frequently incorporate profanity into their acts \nJUDGE (gavel) Inadmissable evidence. \nJIM VOICE OVER Miles & miles of hotel corridors & elevators, filled with citizens Motel Money Murder, Madness Change the mood from glad to sadness Play the ghost song baby \nThe backbeat of WHEN THE MUSIC'S OVER starts, into its spiralling descent. \nSUPERIMPOSITION: \nLAWYER (distant) ...there has not been one shred of evidence: 300 photographs and not one shows a thing; not reliable testimony, nothing but hysterical heresay \nThe PRESS is bored, their numbers reduced. The spectators have changed from kids to OLDER PEOPLE intent on preserving their way of life. A TAPE is playing of Jim's devil voice at the concert, cursing: \"Come on up here. No limits! No laws\", etc... (screams, obscenity) \nJIM & DOORS (SONG) When the music's over (3) Turn out the lights (3) For the music is your special friend Dance on fire as it intends Music is your only friend Until the end (2) \nSUPERIMPOSITION TO: \nLAWYER ...this is a major First Amendment violation by the Police and Politicians of Miami. Every witness they've brought has admitted under oath to not actually seeing the client's genitals -- except one who... \nThe PRESS section is now down to about THREE bored FACES, one of them PATRICIA KENNEALY who looks pregnant. \nJIM smiles at her. \nJIM & DOORS Cancel my subscription to the Resurrection Send my credentials to the house of detention I got some friends inside \nEXT. ORANGE BOWL - MIAMI - DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE (DAY) \nANITA BRYANT & JACKIE GLEASON at the NATIONAL DECENCY RALLY. A large CROWD in the vicinity of 100,000. NIXON addressing them. \nJIM & DOORS SONG (OVER) The face in the mirror won't stop The girl in the window won't stop A feast of friends alive she cried Waiting for me Outside! \nMONTAGE -- NEWSPAPER HEADLINES SPIN OUT: \nJIMMI HENDRIX OVERDOSES IN LONDON. \nJANIS JOPLIN OVERDOSES IN LOS ANGELES. \nA ROLLING STONE WANTED POSTER ON JIM -- \"In the County of Dade/Dead -- Did He Or Didn't He?\". \nJIM & DOORS SONG (OVER) Before I sink into the big sleep I want to hear The scream of the butterfly Come back baby Back into my arms \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - MIAMI BEACH - DAY \nThe MUSIC continuing into a long backbeat without lyrics -- emphasizing the downward spiralling theme... \nJIM ...Well, you gonna get rid of it? Fucked up people y'know, crazies, unwanted Indians just throw it in the river. \nTELEVISION Chicago Seven in it's tenth day... Bobby Seale gagged and chained... (click) L.A. shootout with Black Panthers... (click) Charles Manson indicted for murder of actress Sharon Tate... (click) U. S. ground troops in Laos and Cambodia... (click) Indians still occupying Alcatraz Island... (click) For the My Lai massacre testified 120 villagers shot by American soldiers in a trench... \nThe SONG climaxes into an inner scream of madness. \nJIM & DOORS (CONCLUDE) For the music is your special friend Dance on fire as it intends Music is your only friend Until the end (3) (SCREAM!) \nSilence on Jim. \nJIM (mildly) I think I'm having a nervous breakdown. \nThe sound of wind, the backbeat of LA WOMAN flooding in. \nEXT. CHATEAU MARMONT HOTEL - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT \nJIM dangles out on the narrow ledge that circumscribes the 20th floor rooftop -- wind blowing thru his wild hair, the card zooming by like racer lights on Sunset below. The song LA WOMAN continues born from this renewed feeling of danger. \nJIM & DOORS Well I just got into town 'bout an hour ago Took a look around, see which way the wind blow Where the little girls in their Hollywood bungalows \nPAM screaming for him to come back from the edge as TOM BAKER and MIKE and DOG and a CAMERAMAN film in 16mm. \nPAM JIM! PLEASE GODDAMIT!! COME BACK IN PLEASE!! \nJIM yelling back, as he drinks from a pint of whiskey, enjoying himself enormously. \nJIM Whatcha worried about? I like it out here. \nHe feigns a fall. \nPAM NOOOOOO!! \nRAY and SIDDONS arrive, terrified, looking for him. \nJIM (laughing at Pam) Life on the edge baby. Come get me if you love me baby. \nPAM PLEASE GODDAMIT JIM MORRISON I'M NOT GONNA KILL MYSELF FOR YOU. GET IN HERE. \nJim cracking up with laughter. BAKER, drunk and the FILM CREW love it, swishpanning with a cheap sungun. \nMIKE (dancing) We got it man! Keep going. Great get a two shot. \nBAKER GO ON GET OUT THERE PAM. \nPam is sufficiently cracked on her own set of drugs to start climbing out onto the ledge, skirts blowing in the wind. \nPAM JIM MORRISON GODDAMIT I LOVE YOU I WANT YOU I NEED YOU. \nJim moving further along the ledge. \nJIM (raw) YOUR WHOLE LIFE'S BULLSHIT! YOU LOVE ME THEN COME AND GET ME. \nJIM & DOORS (OVER) LA Woman (X2) LA Woman Sunday afternoon (X3) Drive thru your suburbs Into your blues (X2) Into your blue-blue Blues Into your blues \nSiddons and Ray terrified. Is this the night it's finally going to end in a suicide plunge? Ray trying to stop Pam, too late. \nRAY Pam!! Oh shit... get the ambulances man... \nPam's moving shakily along the ledge, cracked on downers. \nJim watching her come, amazed at her risk. \nRAY (yelling down) JIM! HELP HER. She's gonna fall. \nTOM Jump! \nHe watches, does nothing. \nJIM Come on baby, come on. \nRAY (trying another tack) Jim we gotta finish \"LA Woman\". \nJIM Don't have an ending Ray. \nReaches his hand out. She is closer. But shaky. \nRAY (white) They're both gonna die... ARE YOU HAPPY YOU COCKSUCKERS!! \nRay goes after Tom Baker and the Film Crew. A scuffle. Yelling, shouting, but down below in the intimacy of the ledge, blowing out on the edge, the wind and the world and death. Two crazy children linked on this gothic balcony of the Chateau reach their hands out for each other. \nJIM Come on baby, come on \nPAM (quoting him) \"...but one, the most beautiful one of all -- dances in a ring of fire -- \nJIM (raw singing) \"I see your hair is burning. If they say I never loved you, you know they are a liar!\" \nPAM \"...and throws off the challenge with a shrug\" \nJIM All the poetry has wolves in it Pam!!! \nShe has never been so concentrated, inching closer to him. Her heels overhanging oblivion. \nPAM I don't wanna die with you Jim Morrison, I don't wanna die! \nJIM & DOORS Never saw a woman So alone (X2) So alone -- lone lone \nJIM C'mon Pam, this is it! We'll do it right here! Right now! You and me! \nRay, Tom, Siddons, Mike, Dog, they all watch in horror, sensing it will happen. They have even stopped filming. Inches... inches. \nHe dodges her touch, confused... to the last possible second. Then SHE'S THERE -- in his arms. Her arms latch around him and she hugs him with all her wiry soul. \nROBIN (to Jim) It's you. \nJIM Forever young... \nShe kisses him. \nROBIN Oh it's beautiful... Thank you Uncle Jim. \nINT. RAY'S WORK SPACE - DAY \nOff the patio windows of the birthday party, sounds and sunshine pouring in. The Clown running around, laughter. The music plays -- BRUCE at the mixing board. \nJIM & DOORS Riders on the Storm (x2) Into this house we're born Into this world we're thrown Like a dog without a bone An actor out on loan Riders on the storm \nWhere we and Jim came in, I guess. Jim drinks from a cognac bottle straight, foot tapping, enjoying it, knows it's good -- but other things are calling. This is history. \nJIM I gotta admit -- that ain't bad for four guys who weren't even talking that day. \nSlapping shoulders, shaking hands. \nJOHN You really gonna live in Paris man? \nJIM Yeah John, be anonymous, write a book: \"Observations of an American While on Trial in Miami\". \nROBBIE I still think we got a couple of great blues albums in us man. \nJIM I'm pinned man. Everything I do they got a category for it, y'know. Freedom's gone. \nJOHN Hey, I'm gonna miss you Jim. I'm gonna miss the feeling of playing music with you. \nJIM You can always whip the horses' eyes. You, John, miss me? \nJOHN More than you think asshole. (turn away, repressing -- the emotions) \nROBBIE (walking him to the garden) Well far as I'm concerned, Jim, I made music with Dionysus man. We had some moments on stage like no one will ever fucking know. \nJIM (making light) Yeah, yeah -- and you lay off those drugs Rob. We're gonna play again some day. \nROBBIE Jim -- \"do not go gently into that good night. Rage rage against the dying of the light\". (he winks goodbye) \nThe kids running up to grab JIM, pulls him back to the party. \nGIRLS Come 'ere Uncle Jim, we're playing blind man's bluff... \nTIME CUT TO: \nEXT. GARDEN - LATER DAY \nJIM, a bearded Santa Claus with the birthday hat on his head, surrounded by the GIRLS and BOYS and DOROTHY shooting a home movie. They're eating birthday cake but UNCLE JIM is drinking straight from the cognac bottle -- a strange sight. \nJIM (to Robin) So what are you gonna be when you grow up? \nROBIN I wanna be your wife \nHe laughs, looks at Dorothy who's shooting him with the Super \nJIM I don't know, can I afford you? Pam kinda wiped me out with her dress store y'know... \nROBIN I'll make my own dresses and you'll see, I'll be the best wife. \nDOROTHY (nodding) You'll never be alone Jim. \nJIM (to Dorothy) You know I've never been happier. Not as much of a rush as I used to be in y'know... this is the strangest life I've ever known. \nHis eyes on a LITTLE BOY who's walking into the party, sitting down with the others, ignored, isolated, a birthday cap on his head. Clothes belong to the 1940's and the face seems familiar. Jim is not sure, woozy from the cognac. As he fades. We saw the Boy many years ago in the backseat of the car in the Arizona desert. \nJim's head falling gently into his folded arms on the table, the cognac bottle at his elbow, merlin hat on, beard, the kids laughing, pulling his ears and nose -- he doesn't wake up. \nTIME CUT TO: \nAs Ray comes over now, rouses him gently. \nRAY Gotta plane to catch man? \nJim coming awake in that instant alert way of his, but obviously hung over. \nJIM O?... splittling headache from which the future is made. \nPuzzling remark, He gets up, shaky, exits, kids tearing at him. Goodbyes. \nEXT. RAY'S HOUSE - VENICE - TWILIGHT \nThe beach is behind them, the last of the frisbee players and dogs, the skaters go by, as we continue to hear RIDERS from within. \nRAY Is Pam really there in Paris waiting? \nJIM (ironic, head hurts) Sure. The Count's there so where else would she be? Gotta try to start over, without all the hassles, y'know. I think we can. \nRAY I never knew what you saw in that nightmare chick man. \nJIM Well she is kinda flakey -- like me. I mean she's just so vulnerable about everything. It makes me sad man. (pause) But she's always kinda believed in something about me y'know -- her little picture of me as the unsung poet -- and it's a fantasy I kinda dig y'know, 'stead of the one I live. \nRAY I don't know man, I don't wanna sound like your old man but you're only 27, you're living like you gotta get it all in, you gotta slow down man, you did it, you broke thru to the other side. \nJIM We didn't break thru Ray, we just pushed things a little. When you really break thru, there's nothing left. No music, no Doors, no God, nothing -- only a will to power. \nRAY I don't believe that. You were an American prince, man -- with overbred genes -- (Jim scoffs, laughs) No! What could've been Jim? You could've been President. (Jim cracks up) No man! What could've been Jim? We stood here on this beach on the edge of the Pacific that crazy summer day in '65 -- and we knew, you and I, we knew we were at the edge of the mind. we were there, man. One planet, one globe, one mind. Consciousness, we raised it, we were there. \nJim, not the sentimental type, climbs in his car, amused. \n", "test1_input": "JIM (to Ray, innocently) Jesus Ray, every girl out there wanted to fuck me, I could feel it for the first time! \nRAY Right on stud. But you better watch out for the guys. \nJIM (to the band) Guys, I'm serious about the desert, we still gotta deepen man, we gotta take some peyote -- all of us together, we got one more stage to go... \nROBBIE I don't know man, fucks up my playing. I been playing music for 10 years man and this is the first time in my whole damned life I ever played it. \nJIM Are you satisfied? \nJOHN Will you get off my case! I'm never doing acid again. Too many bad trips man. \nJIM It's not acid John, it's peyote. It's a bonding ceremony. It's got to be more... more... more... \nJOHN I'm into TM man. I promised my guru... \nPAM I want to! I want to! I'm ready. Let's go to the desert... do the peyote, the good peyote. \nJIM (to girl in line) Who's on now? \nGIRL 1 (withering look, very hip) \"Love\". \nJIM Yeah, Arthur Lee's cool. \nGIRL 1 They're the best... better'n the Beatles. \nJIM You mean the Marx Brothers of music, we could blow 'em away. \nThe GIRLS looking at each other like who is this jerk. \nGIRL 2 And who are you? \nJIM The Doors... We're up the street at the Fog. \nLaughter from the GIRLS. \nGIRL 1 (contempt) The Doors. I heard of you. That's the dumbest name. I wouldn't go to the Fog if you paid me. \nJIM Oh yeah what would you do for money? \nPAM Let's go Jim, come on. \nMeanwhile DENSMORE is hitting up on GIRL 2. \nJOHN So you don't have a phone number? What do you mean you don't have a phone number? \nGIRL 2 I don't have a phone number. So give me your number then. \nJOHN I don't have a phone. \nRobbie is doing his imitation of a shrimp for ANOTHER GIRL who's laughing. \nGIRL 1 (intrigued, to Jim) Well, would you leave my name at the door? \nJIM Well I don't know. What's your name? \nGIRL 1 Caprice. \nJIM Caprice? That's the dumbest name I ever heard. \nA look between Jim and Caprice. Pamela pulling Jim away, gives the girl a look. \nJIM Hey! I am the Lizard king. I can do Anything! Raise your hands if you understand! Alive, any of you alive -- let's take a poll -- how many of you know you're really alive!! \nThe crowd giggles. Jim climbs a pole, yells. \nJIM No one? Raise your hands c'mon man... let's go. \nOn the crowd. A few raise their hands, smile. \nWe IRIS in on the Doors suddenly -- a strange sound -- REVERSE IRIS on Jim -- feeling it now. The peyote. \nJIM's POV -- Pam irising out. This strange sound in his ears -- a rattle of an Indian gourd, similar to what we heard in the car in Arizona when Jim was a boy. Now a distant Indian drum beating. The beginning strains of THE END dribble in. \nEXT. DESERT - DAY \nA dented RED CHEVROLET fishtails on a dry mudflat, whipping up dustdevils. \nThey're all LAUGHING (strange noise) -- in a circle somewhere on the edge of a precipice in deep arroyos and magnificent rocks and cacti... \nA football huddle of faces - RAY, JOHN, ROBBIE, JIM -- the four DOORS... laughing with the first mad impulse of the peyote. \nPAM is vomiting her brains out as DOROTHY tries to comfort her on the edge of a cliff... Jim panthers up the dune. \nJIM Everybody having a good time? \nThey hug. She throws up again. \nJIM ...awright, pretty good, it gets better. \nJim holds his head. Feels the ride. \nJIM WOA!! It's fast. \nJUMP CUTS: Jim and Pam are touching each other. Face. Shadows. Sand falls from Pam's hand. Jim turns to hawk at a bird. \"Hawk! Hawk!\" Then Pam is dancing alone on the dune. \nAbruptly Jim is back in the circle with the Doors in a sense torn between them and Pam. EXTREME CLOSEUPS of their faces, their eyes, the tensions of the trip tearing apart their teeth as they go from the laughing to the dangerous part. \nJIM When the serpent appears, his head is ten feet long and five feet wide. He has one red eye and one green eye. He's deadly and he's seven miles long. As he moves -- on his scales is written all the history of the world, all people, all actions, all of us our little pictures on the scales, God it's big! -- and it's eating as it moves all the time, devouring, digesting consciousness, power, a monster of energy! \n", "test1_true": "JIM We must kiss the snake on the tongue, if it senses our fear, it will eat us instantly. But if we kiss it without fear, the snake will take us through the garden and out the gate. To our freedom -we must ride this snake. To the end of time. \nPause. He has instilled a flux of fear in the group. \nJOHN I think I'm fucked up. I'm not thinking right. \nJIM You're fucked up John. Go with it, confusion is the sound of creation. \nJOHN You should see your eyes right now, you're death. Look at your eyes -- you're crazy man, you look crazy. You scare me. \nJIM No no no John John. God is crazy too. God is part insane as well as sane. Not in control all the time. Dionysus was the God of the wine. He made ecstasy but he also made madness. Madness is all right. That's what you want, isn't it, isn't it? Where's that joint? \nROBBIE (crying) I get scared thinking of all the choices inside. I could go. I could stay. I can live anywhere. I could die now if I wanted. It's limitless choice... and no one cares. \nJIM Die Robbie. \nJOHN What the fuck! \nPAM (wandering in) I don't know what I am. I'm on the cusp of Sagittarius and Capricorn. Sagittarius is wild and Capricorn domestic and safe, so I don't know which one to be. \nJim looking at her, smiles. \nJIM I love you. \nDOROTHY (into the same lens) Oh my God, the light, it's so beautiful Ray. Can you see it... it's all one... honey? \nRay has his head buried in his hands. \nRAY I'm in pain man. I want something from the peyote. I feel the universe functioning perfectly but I'm still perfectly locked inside myself. Instead of Oneness, I feel total Isolation. Aloneness. Fear... Pain... Jim, all I feel is pain. \nJIM Pain makes me feel more alive Ray. Pain is meant to wake us up. People try to hide their pain but they're wrong. \nJOHN I feel Lust. I want to fuck everything I can, and I know it will never be enough. \nJIM (whispers) Pam wants you. (normal) You're a good Catholic John, you want it so you can feel guilty about it... Fuck death away John. \nROBBIE I feel Fear... so bad I just numb out all my feelings. I'm afraid of my father, I'm afraid of Yahweh... I wish I could play my guitar. \nJIM Maybe you should kill your father Robbie. He tried to kill you. Kill him! \nROBBIE I'm so fucking scared. \nJIM But you're Alive! It's beautiful! Fear, pain, lust, we've got to know all our feelings before we can come out the other side free men. Don't feel ashamed of yourselves, don't let society destroy your reality. Our freedom's the only thing worth dying for, it's the only thing worth living for! \nHe takes Ray and Robbie's hands, his voice calming them, reform the circle. John hesitant. Not all will enter the gates at evening. \nJOHN (cold sweats) I'm not gonna make it man. I'm scared Jim, I'm still scared. Blindness is coming on. \nJIM Then use us John, use our strength, it's us four now, a tribe of warriors, everything we have comes from the same source, the great Creator of Being. Trust him, trust us. Ride the snake. . . I promise you I will be with you till the end of time. \nPulling John into the circle, bonding, their four heads sunk to the desert floor, Jim making wild Indian sounds, deep- throated \"shoooh... shoooh\"... now humming a song from the desert. \nJIM My wild love went riding... mmmmmm. She rode all the day. She ride to the devil. And ask for him to pay... shooo shoooo \nThe OTHERS join in his chant, the four rising and falling like a collective breath. \nJIM (ad lib) ...she went to the desert she went to the sea Joseph we did see... \nSuddenly Jim breaks and rises out of the circle. Ray, Robbie, John, all looking at him. The same need. Pamela, the desperation of her eyes. \nJIM (to himself) ...I'm lying to you. I am scared. \nHe goes, his boots in the sand. \nJOHN Jim, where are you going. \nJIM (looking back) I'll be back. I gotta go alone. \nPamela calling from another dune, far away. \nPAM Jim! Jim... come here, dance... don't go away. \nHis POV -- of her, receding. She screams for him. He's in pain. Cannot help her. \nA BIRD of prey in the sky. \nJim moving across a lunar landscape. SPECIAL EFFECT: The sun is black like night or else white in a black sky. Voices in the distance. \"Jim, where are you going?\" A mother's voice, a father's voice. \nDOORS SONG Can you picture what will be So limitless and free Desperately in need of some stranger's hand in a desperate land Lost in a Roman wilderness of pain and all the children are insane: waiting for the summer rain \nFLASHBACKS \nINT. CAR - MOVING - DESERT \nJIM, 4, in the back of a car in the desert -- looking back... \nAt the overturned truck, the bodies in the road... at the older Indian looking at him... finally at the dying Indian... his eyes. \nINT. MORRISON HOME - DAY \nSomewhere. The child alone. On the living room floor. Drawing his sketches in a book. MOM's feet moving past -- then DAD'S feet. We may sense a subtle shift in mood when the parents come in -- from the boy's eyes which never leave the sketch he is drawing. \nEXT.

(a roach goes back) There's this chick sings with the Velvet Underground, Andy's band. She says she can drink you under the table. \nThey stare at each other like two cats. Eye level stares that go on and on. She finally hisses in a German accent. \nNICO I'm Nico. It's boring tonight. Some of us are going downtown to a new club. You want to come? \nA voice to kill, looks to undress, fully as tall as Jim. \nTOM (distantly heard) ...elevate your taste in trolls man. \nJIM (to Nico who reaches for her vodka) Vodka? Race you. \nNICO Your death... \nJIM (to Ray and Robbie) Wanna go?... Come on let's go. \nROBBIE She looks too freaky to me. \nNICO Wait just a minute. \nAs she floats away. \nJIM Come on there's pussy Robbie. \nROBBIE (excited) Hey I met this chick Lynne, she wants to be alone. \nLynne is there, pretty, nods to Jim. \nRAY Come on Jim, let's go. \nJIM (childlike) Don't you guys wanna meet Andy Warhol? \nJOHN Tell you the truth, I can live without him. He's a freak. Let's get outta here. We got a show tomorrow. \nJIM Come on man! I thought we were gonna be a band, the four of us -- and party all night, rock and roll! \nRAY (laughs) I could never keep up with you Jim. I couldn't make the music. \nJim's eyes briefly on -- Pamela giggling with the French Count, putting her hand on his arm as she laughs. Innocent, nothing meant but a moment... \nJIM (desperate mockery, grabs Ray) Don't go. Don't leave! You can't leave. I don't know what will happen. It might be Death. \nRAY Come on Jim, this isn't our scene, these people are vampires. We gotta stick together man, the four of us. Let's make the myths man. \nA moment, strange. Slightly SLOW MOTION. Ray tapping Jim's shoulder goodbye... Robbie and John's faces passing on. As if they're parting -- in a symbolic way. Jim blinking in the same SLOW MOTION, looking. Nico is gone -- but Tom is there, across the room, waving. \nThe INDIAN SHAMAN looks like he's standing there in a corner. Jim, ripped, heads for him, but the PR WOMAN cuts him off. Jim forgets he saw the Indian. \nPR MAN Right here Jim, right here. Andy's waiting. You know what you have in common is uniqueness. \nPast more faces. The Music has subtly shifted to STRANGE DAYS somewhere along the way. \nDOORS SONG Strange days have found us Strange days have tracked us down They're going to destroy Our casual joys We shall go on playing or find a new town \nPast a cache of QUEENS in white leather ogling Jim, one of them coming over boldly, chatting him up (AD LIB dimly heard), them grabbing his crotch and kissing him. Jim rearing back, laughing but wary. Past the RICH LADIES dripping with jewels and faces peeled from Brazilian sleep tanks and Swiss knives. \nPast a YOUNG MAN dressed in Jim Morrison leather pants with his hair and eye make-up, a warped image of Jim, smiling back at him. \nJIM (looking for Nico) Nico! \nINT. BEDROOM - SAME NIGHT \nA quieter room, drugged out, the PR GUY cheerily leading JIM, stepping over SLEEPING BODIES, over fur coats strewn across the floor... to a MAN with white hair like a circus clown, his back to us, talking with some black-tied EUROPEAN ARISTOCRATS looking so cool. \nWARHOL Well, it was such a big opening, we just had to go to Philadelphia, y'know, you were supposed to, mmm... \nPR GUY (butting in) Andy! Andy! \nANDY turning at the interruption. He looks like a chic voodoo doll. Holding an incongruous gold telephone in his arms like a teddy bear. \nSlightly SLOW MO as Warhol's black empty eyes confront Jim -- a pit of nothingness in them, amnesia, death. In Jim's SLOW MOTION reaction we read what he sees. Andy going on with his story, to the group that includes TOM BAKER. \nANDY ...but so many people showed up, the paintings were getting crushed, so they took them all down... um, it really looked great y'know... maybe uhhh... (long pause) \nPR MAN (cutting in) ...the walls. The blank walls. Andy was the art. Should do a show. Just walls. Today it's really about people, not what they do. It's the astronaut that matters, not the voyage, the actor, not the movie -- how do I say, it's the trip, not arriving. \nAndy is looking at Jim. Jim at Andy. \nPR MAN (babbling on) ...you know what Andy says, some day everybody's gonna be famous for 15 seconds, but it won't mean anything. \nBAKER That's too short. I need a coupla hours. \nThey laugh. Andy's eyes hidden, face as white as styrofoam. \nANDY We'd just love to have you in our movies Jim, you're so beautiful, you'd be so good, you mmmm, here... this is for you Jim. \nAndy shows his eyes, gives Jim the gold telephone he's carrying. \nANDY Edie gave this to me and said mmmmm, I could talk to God with this. But I don't really have anything to say. So... mmmm now you can talk to God. Oh hi! \nVanishes, waving to somebody else.

ELEVATOR \nNICO stripping... a superb body... riding the floors... \nJim taking an amyl nitrate with her... laughing... Nico with that crazed German laugh... PAMELA pushing the elevator buttons wildly... \nThe elevator opening on her. From Pamela's POV -- Nico down on her knees, her blonde head buried in Jim's leather pants... Jim pinned against the back wall, smiling dopically, eyes barely registering Pam... who screams loud and long, hiding his eyes... not wanting to know... The images faster and more fragmented: Pam beating at Jim wildly. He's laughing. Nico's laughing. The Aristocrats in the hallway are laughing.

DOORS! DOORS! DOORS! to a stage without the Doors. TECHIES are moving amplifiers, running sound checks, stalling time, the MANAGER SIDDONS gauging the crowd, nervous. RICH GIRLS and LOCAL HONCHOS have backstage passes. COPS crawling over the stage, the PROMOTER of the concert trying to get the crowds attention. \nTECHIE (at mike) Testing one-two-three. Testing. \nPROMOTER (on mike) Look, the Fire Marshall's not gonna let the show go on. Either you go back to your seats, you go to the aisle, you don't do that -- no show! \nCROWD (pushing towards stage, no aisles) DOORS! DOORS! DOORS! (turning to) MORRISON! MORRISON! MORRISON! \nINT. BACKSTAGE CORRIDOR - SAME NIGHT \nThe SOUNDS of the CROWD pound thru the hallway. CAMERA following JIM reading a magazine article, accompanied by PATRICIA KENNEALY -- past the TECHIES, turning to look -- they go into empty SHOWER ROOM. \nINT. SHOWER ROOM - SAME NIGHT \nThe Crowd NOISE still carries, echoing. JIM leads PATRICIA to a quiet, isolated stall where they can be alone. Tapping the magazine, sincerely moved by what he reads. \nJIM \"Lord Byron\"? Really. You think? You like the poems? \nPATRICIA Like? I loved them! \"Mad bad and dangerous to know.\" That's what they said about him. Your poems should be taken as seriously. \nJIM These are the kindest words I've ever heard in my life. No one has ever understood. Thank you. (then) Maybe I should always fuck my critics. \nPATRICIA Y'know I don't even like rockers. They're sleazy. I made up my fuck list the other night -- out of 30 guys there were maybe three of them, y'know. I'm not a groupie. \nJIM (hotter, grabs her) Let's do it, here, now... with the sound of the crowd. Like Nuremberg, wild German fucking. \nPATRICIA You like that hunh? Beg! \nJIM I'm begging! I'm begging you! \nPATRICIA You wanna fuck me, Morrison, don't ever lie to me again. Ever! \nJIM About what! \nPATRICIA Your father. Why do you tell me bullshit like your father's dead? \nJIM (pissed) What's your problem with fathers! They're dead, both of them, I told you. \nPATRICIA If he's so dead, then who answered the phone when I called the house? \nJim -- a look, struck. \nPATRICIA (knowing look) You didn't really think you'd get away with that, Morrison. An Admiral in the United States Navy. Who's at the Gulf of Tonkin when Vietnam starts. Your Dad's a Deputy Chief of Operations. \nJIM What'd he say? That was really stupid. Why didn't you just ask me. \nPATRICIA Well naturally he wasn't too happy when I called. Your Mom wanted to talk but he shut her off. \nJIM You're a fuckin' cunt. You could ruin his career if... \nPATRICIA What, I'm a \"fuckin' cunt\" because I called the house? Like it's hard to trace your school records. University of Florida, Albuquerque, New Mexico, Arlington, Virginia, Washington, D.C. Brother, sister, it's seven miles long baby -- it's all in the \"The End\", it's so easy. \nFingering his pants, her hand slips inside. Teasing, dominating him. Her dark side radiant. \nPATRICIA Don't ever try to hide anything from me again. Okay? Go on... tell me. Did he make you cut your hair? Did he hit you, was he a bully? Did he love you? How much? \nJim describes a small space between thumb and forefinger. \nPATRICIA And your mother? \nJim makes a little larger space. \nJIM (pause) I don't want to talk about it. Hate is a very underestimated emotion. \nHis look is right at her. Silence. Patricia knows he won't talk. Through the pause we hear the crowd chanting, bigger and bigger -- \"MORRISON MORRISON MORRISON!\" She's excited, wanting to make love here, now. He's cooled out, however. \nPATRICIA It doesn't matter anymore does it. Listen to them. It's you they want now. Not the Doors, not your mother or your father's child...

Everybody thinks we're drug addicts cause of you Morrison. \nJIM We the Beatles yet? \nJOHN (held by Ray) We took drugs to EXPAND MINDS ASSHOLE, not ESCAPE.

He is a god now as he bends regally, picks one up. \nCOPS everywhere looking as... \nHe lights it. The CROWD going nuts as the DOORS go into the ominous introductory strains of FIVE TO ONE trying to get the onus off Jim and the show on the road. The Audience knows the song, go into a primal FOOT STOMP with it. Bras are thrown on stage. Kids writhe madly in the primal Doors dance. \nPeople with SPARKLERS running through the hangar. CAMERA FLASHBULBS popping throughout the show... get Jim on film while you can. \nJim, drunk, high, smoking the jay, won't go into the lyrics right off, forcing the Doors to circle the beat again.

An INSANE TEENAGER stands on the railing of a balcony above the auditorium, poised to swan dive some 18 feet into the crowd.

Jim starts to whirl the mike cord like a slingshot or bolo, in an ever-widening arc... \n...it flies off and smashes into the head of the PROMOTER at the edge of the stage arguing with SIDDONS. The man is staggered, weaving, Siddons helping him to a FIRST AID TEAM. \nJIM YAAAAAAOOOOOOWWWWWWW!!! \nThe crazy VEGETERIAN HIPPIE runs out on stage to give Jim the white lamb to make this political point. Jim holds the lamb in his arms. It's purring, gentle. DOG chases the HIPPIE off as he gives the microphone back to Jim and takes the lamb from him... he staggers over to ROBBIE and goes down to his knees, pretending to give him head on his frantic stoned guitar solo. \nJIM & DOORS Your ballroom days are over baby Night is drawing near Shadows of the evening Crawl across the years You walk across the floor With a flower in your hand Tryin to tell me no one understands \nPHOTOGRAPHERS flashing cameras. BAKER urging him on from the wings as he passes out. A GIRL runs onto the stage, dumps a bottle of champagne on Jim's head. Jim takes his shirt off, soaking wet. The CROWD is also stripping in the heat, shirts, blouses, screaming so much now they are obviously way past listening to any song. It has become a view of the future -- the NAKED GIRL and BOY dancing stark naked drugged out in the middle of it all, the FAT GIRL prowling naked on the edge of the stage before she's arrested, the FIGHTS in the Crowd, fists, blood, a black man chased and beaten, the sense of Altamont here, the hippie flower trip gone to shit -- it's all come down here tonight, the end of an era. \nJIM & DOORS Trade in your hours for a handful of dimes Gonna make it baby -- in our prime Get together one more time Get together \nHe stops singing suddenly, squinting out into the madness. The arena echoes with the uncomprehending chant of the Mob... \nMOB ...one more time Get together one more time Get together one more time \nSPECIAL EFFECT -- the INDIAN GHOST is leaving Jim's body -- spectrally moving off him, hovering there in the air, its eyes -- the face of a dying Indian on an Arizona highway -- then gone. A moment, only three, four beats. An optical illusion? Maybe. Or is it saying, 'now you are just a white man'... maybe not. As it drifts off in a cloud, into the vast audience's EYEBALL. \nJIM YOU'RE ALL A BUNCHA FUCKIN SLAVES!!! \nThe instruments continue to vamp but there's a hush to the CROWD. \nJIM Lettin people tell you what you're gonna do!

WHAT ARE YA GONNA DO ABOUT IT! \nThe Band has petered out by this point but out of nowhere, ROBBIE, zonked on his version of LSD, starts up with \"TOUCH ME BABE.\" \nJIM & DOORS (going with it) Come on, come on, come on and FUCK me babe! Can't you see that I am not afraid (cuts the music) HEY WAIT A MINUTE... (music cuts off raggedly) Miami Beach Florida hunh? I was BORN and RAISED not far from here... went to Florida State... (cheers) Then I GOT SMART. I went to California where you can let your hair grow long and walk down the street without people calling you a FREAK... They're trying to CHANGE THE WORLD out there in California. \nVOICES Yeah, STOP THE WAR MAN, PEACEEE... WE LOVE YA JIM. \nJIM NO I'm not talkin' 'bout NO REVOLUTION. I'm not talkin 'bout no DEMONSTRATION. I'm talking 'bout HAVING SOME FUN. I'm talkin' 'bout DANCIN. I'm talkin 'bout LOVE. I'm talkin' 'bout some LOVE. LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE... LOVE!!!! Grab your friend -- and LOVE him. Come oooooaaaannnnn. Yeah! \nJim pulling his shirt off -- barechested -- waving it like a toreador in front of his leather crotch. \nVOICES (cheers, giggles) \"Light My Fire\"! Come on Jim -- play \"Light My Fire\"! \nThe audience seems to be paying no attention to what he is doing or saying, which drives him to deeper rage. \nJIM Ain't nobody gonna love my ass? Come on... I need ya. There's so many of ya out there and nobody's gonna love me! C'mon -- what'cha come here for anyway? You didn't come here for music. You didn't come here to see a good band. You came here for THIS didn't ya... \nHe saunters to the edge of the stage. Hisses at them. He clasps his crotch, leering at a cute LITTLE GIRL in the front row, shaking it at her. Her BOYFRIEND, pissed at Jim, runs for the stage. Jim unzips his leathers. \nJIM I'm lonely out here -- Ya wanna SEE IT... COME ON SWEETHEART... I need it, I NEED IT, need ya, need ya, NEED YA, COME OOOOOAAAANNNNNNN... \nChaos, confusion now erupt in the crowd! The BOYFRIEND is running at JIM as the BODYGUARDS throw him back into the crowd. Jim flicking his shirt over his crotch, back and forth like a drunken matador. The Doors look at each other, don't know what's going to happen. \nJIM Didja see it! You wanna see it AGAIN??? \nThe crowd roars its approval. Confusion reigns. Drunken CATCALLS. Things, bras, cans thrown at the stage. \nVOICES (ad lib) Take it off! Take it all off! \nJIM What if I pull it out fer ya!! And SHAKE IT AROUND!!! Will that do it for you! Would ya, would ya, would ya!! Now watch -- I'm gonna show it to ya! \nHe feigns opening his belt and exposing himself, flipping his shirt back and forth over the crotch in a mock striptease. \nJIM There it was! Ya see it? Ya see it?... Ya wanna see it again? \nA flock of TEENAGE GIRLS are sure they've seen it, hysterical. \nTEENAGE GIRL I saw it!... Yes, yes! Jim! Jim! \nTEENAGE GIRL 2 Where?

HANNAH Let's go. 
She leads him out of the bar. We STAY WITH the WOMEN Jacob had just been introducing himself to. 
WOMAN #1 Slut. 
66 INT. JACOB'S APARTMENT - LATER 66 
We haven't been here yet. It's exactly what you'd expect though: an elegant bachelor-pad. Modern furniture. Sleek. Everything just right. Jacob puts an album on his record player. 
(CONTINUED) 66 CONTINUED: 66 HANNAH This place looks like something out of a men's magazine. 
JACOB Is that a compliment? 
HANNAH I'm not sure. 
Music starts playing: "As Tears Go By" by the Stones. 
HANNAH I like this song. 
JACOB I thought you would. (THEN) Drink? 
HANNAH Yes, please. 
Jacob pours two nice glasses of SCOTCH, neat. Brings them (and the bottle) over towards the couch. 
He pats the couch. Hannah nods, walks over, sits down. 
JACOB Cheers. 
HANNAH Cheers. 
They CLINK. Jacob takes a sip. Hannah downs hers. She holds out her glass for a refill. 
Jacob raises a brow, pours her another. This time she HOLDS HER NOSE as she downs it. As soon as she finishes choking... 
HANNAH So is this how it normally works? 
JACOB What? 
HANNAH How you woo a woman? You take them back to your granite- countered bachelor pad, put on the perfect song, and make them a drink? 
(CONTINUED) 66 CONTINUED: (2) 66 JACOB Yes. That's how it normally works. 
Hannah NODS, grabs the bottle, takes a swig. 
HANNAH And then you sleep with them? 
JACOB Yes. 
HANNAH So that's what happens next? We sleep together? 
JACOB At some point, yes, I was under the impression that was your plan. 
She takes a deep breath, admits: 
HANNAH I'm very nervous. 
JACOB I'm getting that. 
HANNAH I know at the bar I seemed confident, but I was more just soaking wet and cold and trying to be dramatic. 
Jacob LAUGHS. He actually LAUGHS. 
JACOB You're adorable. 
Hannah SNAPS, already tipsy. 
HANNAH No! Not adorable! Sexy! R-rated sexy! Because I know what happens next in the PG-13 version of tonight: I get really drunk, and I pass out, and you cover me with a blanket, and kiss my forehead, and nothing happens... but that's not why I'm here! (THEN) I'm here to bang the hot guy from the bar who hit on me. 
(CONTINUED) 66 CONTINUED: (3) 66 JACOB I don't think people say `bang' anymore. 
HANNAH I do. We're going to bang. I'm finally going to do something exciting and dangerous and Liz can blow me! 
Hannah shakes her hands out, pumping herself up. 
HANNAH Okay, okay, this is happening. (THEN) Take off your shirt. 
JACOB What? 
HANNAH I need to stop thinking. Take off your shirt. 
Jacob SHRUGS, stands, unbuttons his shirt and takes it off. He's ripped. 
HANNAH Holy crap. 
She pokes a finger at his abs. 
HANNAH It's like you're photo-shopped.

Elyse (73), his wife, scolds him. 
ELYSE And why would you stay? 
RICHARD Please wait.     Let me try to deal with this. 
TOM We're not going to risk our lives, so hurry. 
Douglas looks defiantly at Tom. 
DOUGLAS You do what you have to do, we'll wait. 
70   EXT. HAMLET -- DAY 
Richard and Anwar walk down the streets of the small hamlet before the people's inquisitive gaze. They arrive at a general store with all sorts of roots and grains displayed outside. Anwar walks over to the owner. 
ANWAR (in Arabic) We need your phone.     I'll pay for the call. 
71   INT. ROOM, ANWAR'S HOUSE -- DAY 
Susan is lying on the floor, desolate. It seems as if the pain is diminishing. The grandmother leans over her and softly caresses her with her dirty, wrinkled hands. This startles Susan. 
ANWAR'S GRANDMOTHER (In Arabic) How do you feel? 
Susan is a little bit uncomfortable with her this close. 
SUSAN Can I have some water? 
The old woman doesn't seem to understand. She grabs a basket of dates and offers them to her. Susan shakes her head. 
SUSAN (CONT'D) No, water... 
With her hand, Susan mimes drinking a glass of water. The old woman seems to understand. She pours some water from a jar, leans over her and helps her drink in small sips. 
SUSAN (CONT'D) Thanks. 
The grandmother bows her head as if to say "your welcome." 
SUSAN (CONT'D) Where's my husband? 
The old woman just smiles. Susan makes a gesture of desperation. The grandmother leans over her, unfurls her index finger and points at her heart. 
ANWAR'S GRANDMOTHER (In Arabic) Trust in god. 
Susan keeps looking at her as she slowly gets up and goes to sit in a chair. 
72   INT. GENERAL STORE -- DAY 
Richard is in a small cubicle dialing on an old cream-colored rotary phone while Anwar waits discretely in a corner. Dozens of people watch from outside. Richard turns to look at them while the call connects. 
RICHARD Yes... Rachel? It's Richard... 
RACHEL (O.S.) Â¿Are you still in Moroccco? 
RICHARD Yes, we're still in Morocco...Rachel, there was an accident, your sister was shot... 
RACHEL (O.S.) (Surprised) What? Who shot her? 
RICHARD I don't know... We were shot at from some hills. 
RACHEL Is she ok? 
RICHARD She was hit in her neck and shoulder. Rachel, she's not doing well... I need you to tell the embassy as soon as possible... wait... and call Mark... 
RACHEL (O.S.) Where are you? 
He turns to Anwar. 
RICHARD Anwar, where are we? 
ANWAR In Tazarine, three hours southwest of Erfoud. 
RICHARD Were in Tazarine, T-a-z-a-r-I-n-e Three hours southwest of Erfoud... in the desert... it's a town... there's no hospital... There's nothing here at all... 
RACHEL (O.S.) Where are you calling me from? 
RICHARD From a shop. Rachel, this is urgent... urgent... call the embassy... They have to help us... call James too... 
RACHEL (O.S.) Why did they shoot her? 
RICHARD I don't know... Rachel, you're sister's badly hurt... do you understand? Call for help... now... 
He hangs up. As soon as he does, he turns to Anwar. 
RICHARD (CONT'D) Call an ambulance... 
ANWAR I'll call Erfoud so they send one over. 
Anwar, clumsy and stressed at Richard's desperation, takes the phone and starts dialing. 
RICHARD And find a doctor... 
As he finishes dialing, Anwar turns to Richard. 
ANWAR They've already gone to look for him. 
73   INT. ROOM, ANWAR'S HOUSE -- DAY 
Richard returns to the room. Susan, weak, lies with her eyes open. The grandmother is tending to the wound, which won't stop bleeding. She gets up and goes to Anwar. 
ANWAR'S GRANDMOTHER (in Arabic) Anwar, bring me some water. 
74   EXT. PATIO, ANWAR'S HOUSE -- DAY 
Anwar goes out to the patio and fetches a metal basin full of soil. He goes to a well, scoops out some water with a gourd and washes out the basin.

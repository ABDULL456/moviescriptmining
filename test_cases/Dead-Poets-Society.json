WELTON ACADEMY HALLWAY - DAY \nA young boy, dressed in a school uniform and cap, fidgets as his mother adjusts his tie. \nMOTHER Now remember, keep your shoulders back. \nA student opens up a case and removes a set of bagpipes. The young boy and his brother line up for a photograph \nPHOTOGRAPHER Okay, put your arm around your brother. That's it. And breathe in. \nThe young boy blinks as the flash goes off. \nPHOTOGRAPHR Okay, one more. \nAn old man lights a single candle. A teacher goes over the old man's duties. \nTEACHER Now just to review, you're going to follow along the procession until you get to the headmaster. At that point he will indicate to you to light the candles of the boys. \nMAN All right boys, let's settle down. \nThe various boys, including NEIL, KNOX, and CAMERON, line up holding banners. Ahead of them is the old man, followed by the boy with the bagpipes with the two youngest boys at the front. \nMAN Banners up. \nThe boys hoist the banners and the bagpipes begin to play loudly. The small group marches out of the room and down a set of stairs into a church. The pews are filled with students and parents while the teachers, all dressed in robes, are seated at the front of the church behind the headmaster. \nThe boys break off to either side at the front of the church. The bagpipes cease and the headmaster, MR. NOLAN, walks over to the old man carrying the candle. \nMR NOLAN Ladies and gentlemen, boys, the light of knowledge. \nAn organ begins to play as the old man goes forward with shaking hands to the young boys in the front pew. Each boy is holding a candle and he bends over to light the first one. Each boy in turn lights the candle of the boy next to him. \nMR NOLAN One hundred years ago, in 1859, 41 boys sat in this room and were asked the same question that greets you at the start of each semester. Gentlemen, what are the four pillars? \nAll throughout the pews, uniformed boys rise to their feet. TODD, who is not wearing a uniform, is urged by his father to stand with them. \nBOYS Tradition, honor, discipline, excellence. \nThe boys quickly return to their seats. \nMR NOLAN In her first year, Welton Academy graduated five students. Last year we graduated fifty-one. And more than seventy-five percent of those went on to the Ivy League. This, this kind of accomplishment is the result of fervent dedication to the principles taught here. This is why you parents have been sending us your sons. This is why we are the best preparatory school in the United States. \nMr. Nolan soaks up the applause from the audience. \nMR NOLAN As you know, our beloved Mr. Portius of the English department retired last term. You will have the opportunity later to meet his replacement, Mr. John Keating, himself a graduate of this school. And who, for the past several years, has been teaching at the highly regarded Chester School in London. \nThe crowd applauds once again. \nEXT.

Hey, I hear you got the new kid. Looks like a stiff! \nHe begins laughing when he notices Todd coming into the room. \nCAMERON Oops! \nCameron quickly leaves. Neil tries to keep from laughing as Todd enters the room and sets his luggage down on his bed. \nNEIL Listen, don't mind Cameron. He was born with his foot in his mouth. You know what I mean? \nHe pulls some papers from his blazer pocket and playfully whacks Todd across the back with it. \nCHARLIE comes to the door with a smug expression on his face.

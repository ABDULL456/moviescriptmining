{"train": "Dead Poets Society: Final Script \nINT. WELTON ACADEMY HALLWAY - DAY \nA young boy, dressed in a school uniform and cap, fidgets as his mother adjusts his tie. \nMOTHER Now remember, keep your shoulders back. \nA student opens up a case and removes a set of bagpipes. The young boy and his brother line up for a photograph \nPHOTOGRAPHER Okay, put your arm around your brother. That's it. And breathe in. \nThe young boy blinks as the flash goes off. \nPHOTOGRAPHR Okay, one more. \nAn old man lights a single candle. A teacher goes over the old man's duties. \nTEACHER Now just to review, you're going to follow along the procession until you get to the headmaster. At that point he will indicate to you to light the candles of the boys. \nMAN All right boys, let's settle down. \nThe various boys, including NEIL, KNOX, and CAMERON, line up holding banners. Ahead of them is the old man, followed by the boy with the bagpipes with the two youngest boys at the front. \nMAN Banners up. \nThe boys hoist the banners and the bagpipes begin to play loudly. The small group marches out of the room and down a set of stairs into a church. The pews are filled with students and parents while the teachers, all dressed in robes, are seated at the front of the church behind the headmaster. \nThe boys break off to either side at the front of the church. The bagpipes cease and the headmaster, MR. NOLAN, walks over to the old man carrying the candle. \nMR NOLAN Ladies and gentlemen, boys, the light of knowledge. \nAn organ begins to play as the old man goes forward with shaking hands to the young boys in the front pew. Each boy is holding a candle and he bends over to light the first one. Each boy in turn lights the candle of the boy next to him. \nMR NOLAN One hundred years ago, in 1859, 41 boys sat in this room and were asked the same question that greets you at the start of each semester. Gentlemen, what are the four pillars? \nAll throughout the pews, uniformed boys rise to their feet. TODD, who is not wearing a uniform, is urged by his father to stand with them. \nBOYS Tradition, honor, discipline, excellence. \nThe boys quickly return to their seats. \nMR NOLAN In her first year, Welton Academy graduated five students. Last year we graduated fifty-one. And more than seventy-five percent of those went on to the Ivy League. This, this kind of accomplishment is the result of fervent dedication to the principles taught here. This is why you parents have been sending us your sons. This is why we are the best preparatory school in the United States. \nMr. Nolan soaks up the applause from the audience. \nMR NOLAN As you know, our beloved Mr. Portius of the English department retired last term. You will have the opportunity later to meet his replacement, Mr. John Keating, himself a graduate of this school. And who, for the past several years, has been teaching at the highly regarded Chester School in London. \nThe crowd applauds once again. \nEXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS - DAY \nThe school lawn is a filled with luggage, students, and parents mulling about in every direction. \nINT CHURCH ENTRANCE - DAY \nMr Nolan stands by the entrance, speaking with each family as they leave. \nMR NOLAN Glad you could come by. \nMR ANDERSON Thrilling ceremony as usual Dr. Nolan. \nMR NOLAN You've been away too long. \nMRS ANDERSON Hello Dr. Nolan. \nMR NOLAN Good to have you back. \nMRS ANDERSON This is our youngest, Todd. \nMR NOLAN Mr. Anderson.You have some big shoes to fill, young man. Your brother was one of our finest. \nTODD Thank you. \nTodd and his parents leave while others file past Mr. Nolan. \nWOMAN Lovely ceremony. \nMR NOLAN Thank you. So glad you liked it. \nCAMERON Neil, study group tonight? \nNEIL Yeah, sure. \nCAMERON Business as usual, huh? Hey, I hear you got the new kid. Looks like a stiff! \nHe begins laughing when he notices Todd coming into the room. \nCAMERON Oops! \nCameron quickly leaves. Neil tries to keep from laughing as Todd enters the room and sets his luggage down on his bed. \nNEIL Listen, don't mind Cameron. He was born with his foot in his mouth. You know what I mean? \nHe pulls some papers from his blazer pocket and playfully whacks Todd across the back with it. \nCHARLIE comes to the door with a smug expression on his face. Knox and MEEKS are close behind him. He points at Neil \nCHARLIE Rumor has it, you did summer school. \nNEIL Yep. Chemistry. My father thought I should get ahead. How was your summer Slick? \nCHARLIE Keen. \nThe boys enter the room. Charlie turns around and looks at Meeks who is just entering. \nCHARLIE Meeks. Door. Closed. \nMEEKS Yes sir. \nNEIL Gentlemen, what are the four pillars? \nBOYS Travesty. Horror. Decadence. Excrement. \nCharlie makes himself comfortable on Neil's bed and lights up a cigarette. Meanwhile, Todd is by his bed unpacking his luggage. \nCHARLIE Okay, study group. Meeks aced Latin. I didn't quite flunk English. So, if you want, we've got our study group. \nNEIL Sure. Cameron asked me too. Anyone mind including him? \nCHARLIE Hmm, what's his specialty, boot-licking? \nNEIL Come on, he's your roommate. \nCHARLIE That's not my fault. \nMeeks seems to notice Todd for the first time. \nMEEKS Oh, I'm sorry, my name is Steven Meeks. \nNeil quickly gets up from his spot by the window. \nNEIL Oh, this is Todd Anderson. \nTodd turns around and shakes hands with Meeks. \nMEEKS Nice to meet you. \nTODD Nice to meet you. \nCHARLIE Charlie Dalton. \nCharlie continues to lay on the bed, looking smug. Knox extends a hand. \nKNOX Knox Overstreet. \nNEIL Todd's brother was Jeffrey Anderson. \nCHARLIE Oh yeah, sure. Valedictorian. National merit scholar. \nMEEKS Oh well, welcome to Hell-ton. \nCHARLIE It's every bit as tough as they say, unless you're a genius like Meeks. \nMEEKS He flatters me. That's why I help him with Latin. \nCHARLIE And English, and Trig. \nCharlie begins coughing. There is a knock at the door. Charlie quickly stamps out his cigarette on the floor and Neil tries to wave the smoke from the air. \nMR. MCALLISTER tries to make it upstairs against the steady stream. \nMCALLISTER Slow down boys, slow down you horrible phalanx of pubescense. \nINT CHEMISTRY LAB - DAY \nA teacher walks up and down the aisles, handing out books. \nTEACHER Pick three laboratory experiments from the project list and report on them every five weeks. The first twenty questions at the end of chapter one are due tomorrow. \nThe students let out a collective groan. \nINT. LATIN CLASSROOM - DAY \nMr. McAllister paces back and forth in front of the blackboard and gets the students to repeat everything he says. \nMCALLISTER (students repeat after each word.) Agricolam. Agricola. Agricolae. Agricolarum. Agricolis. Agricolas. Agrilcolis. \nAgain, please. Agricola. \nINT. MATH CLASSROOM - DAY \nDr. Hager walks up the classroom aisles with his arms behind his back. \nHAGER Your study of trigonometry requires absolute precision. Anyone failing to turn in any homework assignment will be penalized one point off their final grade. Let me urge you now not to test me on this point. \nINT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY \nStudents enter Keating's classroom, talking and acting up. Keating glances out from his room off to one side. \nKNOX Hey Spaz, Spaz. \nSpaz turns around in time to be hit by a ball of crumpled up paper while Cameron smacks him on the shoulder. \nCAMERON Brain damage. \nThe students quickly quiet down as Keating emerges from the other room, whistling the 1812 Overture. He walks up the length of the classroom and out the door without a word. The students look around at one another, uncertain of what to do. Keating pokes his head back in the doorway. \nKEATING Well come on. \nHe gestures them to follow and the students, after some hesitation, grab their books and follow Keating out into the main entranceway. \nINT. ENTRANCEWAY - DAY \nKeating stands before the school's trophy cabinets and waits until all the boys arrive. \nKEATING \"Oh Captain, My Captain\" who knows where that comes from? \nTodd looks up as if he knows the answer, but says nothing. Spaz blows his nose a little too close to Meeks for his liking. \nKEATING Not a clue? It's from a poem by Walt Whitman about Mr. Abraham Lincoln. Now in this class you can call me Mr. Keating. Or, if you're slightly more daring, Oh Captain, My Captain. \nThe students laugh slightly. \nKEATING Now let me dispel a few rumors so they don't fester into facts. Yes, I too attended Hell-ton and survived. And no, at that time I was not the mental giant you see before you. I was the intellectual equivalent of a ninety-eight pound weakling. I would go to the beach and people would kick copies of Byron in my face. \nThe boys laugh once again, while Cameron, obviously trying to write all this down, looks around confusedly. Keating looks down at papers in his hand. \nKEATING Now, Mr\u0085 Pitts. That's a rather unfortunate name. Mr. Pitts, where are you? \nPitts raises his hand while everyone around him snickers. \nKEATING Mr. Pitts, would you open your hymnal to page 542 and read the first stanza of the poem you find there? \nPITTS \"To the virgins, to make much of time\"? \nKEATING Yes, that's the one. Somewhat appropriate, isn't it. \nPITTS \"Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, old time is still a flying, and this same flower that smiles today, tomorrow will be dying.\" \nKEATING Thank you Mr. Pitts. \"Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.\" The Latin term for that sentiment is Carpe Diem. Now who knows what that means? \nMeeks immediately puts his hand up. \nMEEKS Carpe Diem. That's \"seize the day.\" \nKEATING Very good, Mr.- \nMEEKS Meeks. \nNEIL Suit yourself. \nINT. TODD'S ROOM - EVENING \nTodd is seated at his desk. He scrawls \"CARPE DIEM\" across a blank page of his notebook. He looks at it for a few moments before crumpling it up and opening up his Chemistry book. \nINT. ENTRANCEWAY - NIGHT \nHager comes down the stairs. Knox is looking at one of the old class photos on the walls. \nHAGER Ready Overstreet? \nKnox reluctantly follows after Dr. Hager. \nKNOX Ready to go sir. \nEXT. ROAD - NIGHT \nThe car leaves Welton and drives towards the Danburry's house. \nINT / EXT DANBURRY'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe doorbell rings. \nMRS DANBURRY (O.S.) Chet, can you get that? \nCHET (O.S.) I can't, Mom. \nCHRIS (O.S.) I'll get it. \nThe door opens and Knox is awe-struck by the beautiful girl (CHRIS) who has answered the door. \nCHRIS Can I help you? \nKnox manages to break out of his daze. \nKNOX Hi. Knox Overstreet. Uh, Dr. Hager. \nCHRIS Hi. \nKNOX This is the Danburry's, right? \nCHRIS Are you here to see Chet? \nKNOX Mrs. Danburry? \nChris begins to laugh as Mrs. Danburry arrives behind her. \nCHRIS No. \nMRS DANBURRY Sorry. Thank you Chris. I'm Mrs. Danburry. You must be Knox. \nKNOX Yes. \nMRS DANBURRY (to Dr. Hager) Back by nine. (to Knox) Please come in. \nCHET (O.S.) Chris, come on, what are you doing? \nCHRIS Chet, I'm coming. \nKnox enters the house, his mind still hung up on Chris as MR DANBURRY comes out of the living room to meet him. \nMR DANBURRY Knox. How are you? Joe Danburry. \nKNOX Nice to meet you sir. \nMR DANBURRY Well he's the spitting image of his father, isn't he. How is he? Come on in. \nCHET (O.S.) Chris! \nKNOX He's great. He just did a big case for GM. \nCHRIS (O.S.) I'm coming. \nMR DANBURRY I know where you're headed, like father like son, huh? \nINT. STUDENT LOUNGE - NIGHT \nSeveral students are throwing darts at a small rubber skeleton hanging from the bulletin board. Various students are studying and playing games. Meeks and Pitts are sitting at one table working on their \"hi-fi system\". Meeks is waving an antenna around with no luck. Pitts points out to him that he forgot to plug it in. Neil, Cameron, and Charlie are working on their trig homework. \nKEATING I mean, how can you describe poetry like American Bandstand? I like Byron, I give him a 42, but I can't dance to it. \nCharlie suddenly appear to become interested in the class. \nKEATING Now I want you to rip out that page. \nThe students look at Keating as if he has just gone mad. \nKEATING Go on, rip out the entire page. You heard me, rip it out. Rip it out! \nCharlie looks around at the others. He then looks down at his own notes, which consists of drawing breasts. \nKEATING Go on, rip it out. \nCharlie rips the page out and holds it up. \nKEATING Thank you Mr. Dalton. Gentlemen, tell you what, don't just tear out that page, tear out the entire introduction. I want it gone, history. Leave nothing of it. Rip it out. Rip! Begone J. Evans Pritchard, Ph.D. Rip, shred, tear. Rip it out. I want to hear nothing but ripping of Mr. Pritchard. \nMeeks looks around reluctantly and then finally begins tearing out pages. \nKEATING We'll perforate it, put it on a roll. \nKeating sees Cameron still hesitating. \nKEATING It's not the bible, you're not going to go to hell for this. Go on, make a clean tear, I want nothing left of it. \nKeating goes over to his room. Cameron turns around to Neil. \nCAMERON We shouldn't be doing this. \nNEIL Rip, rip, rip! \nNeil makes Cameron turn back around. \nKEATING (O.S.) Rip it out, rip! \nFrom outside the classroom, Mr. McAllister hears all the noise and sees all the students ripping out the pages. He bursts into the room. \nMCALLISTER What the hell is going on here? \nThe boys all turn around in shock. Charlie stuffs a crumpled page into his mouth. Keating emerges from his room with a waste paper basket. \nKEATING I don't hear enough rips. \nMCALLISTER Mr. Keating. \nKEATING Mr. McAllister. \nMCALLISTER I'm sorry, I- I didn't know you were here. \nKEATING I am. \nMCALLISTER Ahh, so you are. Excuse me. \nMr. McAllister slowly backs out of the classroom. \nKEATING Keep ripping gentlemen. This is a battle, a war. And the casualties could be your hearts and souls. \nKeating holds out the basket to Charlie who spits out a wad of paper. \nKEATING Thank you Mr. Dalton. Armies of academics going forward, measuring poetry. No, we will not have that here. No more of Mr. J. Evans Pritchard. Now in my class you will learn to think for yourselves again. You will learn to savor words and language. No matter what anybody tells you, words and ideas can change the world. I see that look in Mr. Pitt's eye, like nineteenth century literature has nothing to do with going to business school or medical school. Right? Maybe. Mr. Hopkins, you may agree with him, thinking \"Yes, we should simply study our Mr. Pritchard and learn our rhyme and meter and go quietly about the business of achieving other ambitions.\" I have a little secret for ya. Huddle up. Huddle up! \nThe boys get up from their seats and gather around Keating in the center of the class. \nKEATING We don't read and write poetry because it's cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. Medicine, law, business, engineering, these are all noble pursuits, and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for. To quote from Whitman: \"O me, o life of the questions of these recurring, of the endless trains of the faithless, of cities filled with the foolish. What good amid these, o me, o life? Answer: that you are here. That life exists, and identity. That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse. That the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse. \nKeating looks up at Todd. \nKeating What will your verse be? \nINT. HEAD OF CAFETERIA - DAY \nThe cafeteria is filled with students and teachers standing before the tables saying grace. \nALL For what we are about to receive, may the Lord make us truly grateful. Amen. \nMr. Keating and Mr. McAllister are seated next to one another at the table. \nMCALLISTER Quite an interesting class you gave today, Mr. Keating. \nThe other boys crouch down around Keating. \nKEATING The Dead Poets were dedicated to sucking the marrow out of life. That's a phrase from Thoreau that we'd invoke at the beginning of each meeting. You see we'd gather at the old Indian cave and take turns reading from Thoreau, Whitman, Shelley; the biggies. Even some of our own verse. And in the enchantment of the moment we'd let poetry work its magic. \nKNOX You mean it was a bunch of guys sitting around reading poetry? \nKEATING No Mr. Overstreet, it wasn't just \"guys\", we weren't a Greek organization, we were romantics. We didn't just read poetry, we let it drip from our tongues like honey. Spirits soared, women swooned, and gods were created, gentlemen, not a bad way to spend an evening eh? Thank you Mr. Perry for this trip down amnesia lane. Burn that, especially my picture. \nKeating hands the annual back and walks away, whistling once again. Neil remains crouched. \nNEIL Dead Poets Society. \nCAMERON What? \nThe school bells begin ringing and everyone heads back towards the school. Neil stands up. \nNEIL I say we go tonight. \nCHARLIE Tonight? \nCAMERON Wait a minute. \nPITTS Where's this cave he's talking about? \nNEIL It's beyond the stream. I know where it is. \nPITTS That's miles. \nCAMERON Sounds boring to me. \nCHARLIE Don't go. \nCAMERON You know how many de-merits we're talking Dalton \nCHARLIE So don't come, please. \nCAMERON Look, all I'm saying is that we have to be careful, we can't get caught. \nCHARLIE No shit, Sherlock. \nHAGER (yelling) You boys there, hurry up. \nNeil turns around and faces the other boys. \nNEIL All right, who's in? \nCAMERON Come on Neil, Hager's right- \nNEIL Forget Hager, no. Who's in? \nCHARLIE I'm in. \nHAGER (O.S.) I'm warning you, move. \nCAMERON Me too. \nPITTS I don't know Neil \nNEIL What? Pitts- \nCHARLIE Pitsie, come on. \nMEEKS His grades are hurting Charlie. \nNEIL You can help him Meeks. \nPITTS What is this, a midnight study group? \nNEIL Forget it Pitts, you're coming. Meeks, are your grades hurting too? \nMEEKS I'll try anything once. \nCHARLIE Except sex. \nMEEKS Ha ha ha. \nCAMERON I mean as long as we're careful. \nThe boys run into the building. \nHager walks past the bathroom and into his room. \nHAGER Cut out that racket in there. \nThe kazoo player lets out a rude squeek before finally stopping. Hager glares at them for a moment. \nINT NEIL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nNeil stands in his doorway. He looks across the hall to the other room where Cameron and Charlie are standing. Cameron gives a thumbs up. Neil closes his room door and takes out his cloak and a flashlight. Setting the flashlight down on the desk, he notices a worn book, \"Five Centuries of Verse\", sitting there. Opening it up, he sees John Keating's name at the top followed by \"Dead Poets\". Below the title of the book, is written: \"To Be Read At The Opening of D.P.S. Meetings.\" Along with several lines from Thoreau, beginning with \"I went to the woods because I wanted to live deliberately\u0085\" \nINT STAIRWAY - NIGHT \nThe shadows of hooded figures can be seen moving throughout the darkened halls. \nINT HAGER'S ROOM - NIGHT \nHager hears a dog barking. \nINT HALLWAY - NIGHT \nSomeone drops a number of dog biscuits by the dog's feet. He stops barking and immediately begins gobbling them down. Hager looks out into the hallway with his flashlight but sees nothing. \nEXT SCHOOL GROUNDS - NIGHT \nThe boys quietly leave the building and set off running across the fields towards the woods. \nEXT WOODS - NIGHT \nThe boys search about the trees trying to find the cave. Meeks is searching around when Charlie leaps up behind Meeks in the dark shining the flashlight up at his own face and grabs Meeks by the shoulder. \nCHARLIE Arrr, I'm a dead poet. \nMEEKS Aww, Charlie. \nCHARLIE (laughing) Guys, over here. \nMEEKS You're funny. You're real funny. \nINT CAVE - NIGHT \nThe boys are trying to start a fire. The cave is quickly filling up with smoke. \nMEEKS It's too wet. \nCHARLIE God, are you trying to smoke us out of here? \nMEEKS No, no, the smoke's going right up this opening. \nPitts tries to stand up and slams his head into the low rock ceiling. He lets out a yell while the others laugh. \nNEIL You okay? \nPITTS Oh God. Clowns. \nNEIL All right, all right, forget the fire. Let's go gentlemen. \nNeil stands before the others with the book in hand, and takes a drag on a cigarette. \nNEIL I hereby reconvene the Dead Poets Society. \nThe boys cheer. \nNEIL Welton chapter. The meetings will be conducted by myself and the other new initiates now present. Todd Anderson, because he prefers not to read, will keep minutes of the meetings. I'll now read the traditional opening message by society member Henry David Thoreau. \"I went to the woods because I wanted to live deliberately. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life.\" \nCHARLIE I'll second that. \nNEIL \"To put to rout all that was not life, and not, when I had come to die, discover that I had not lived. \nSeveral boys whistle softly in reaction to the poem. \nNEIL And Keating's marked a bunch of other pages. \nNeil begins flipping through the book. \nCHARLIE All right, intermission. Dig deep right here. Right here, lay it down \nCAMERON On the mud? We're gonna put our food on the mud? \nCHARLIE Meeks, put your coat down. Picnic blanket. \nNEIL So, I'm gonna act. Yes, yes! I'm gonna be an actor! Ever since I can remember, I've wanted to try this. I even tried to go to summer stock auditions last year, but, of course, my father wouldn't let me. For the first time in my whole life I know what I wanna do. \nNeil grabs a handful of papers off Todd's bed and tosses them into the air. \nNEIL and for the first time I'm gonna do it whether my father wants me to or not! Carpe diem! \nTODD Neil, Neil, hold on a minute. How are you gonna be in a play if your father won't let you? \nNEIL First I gotta get the part, then I can worry about that. \nTODD Yeah, but won't he kill you if he finds out you went to an audition and didn't even tell him? \nNEIL No, no, no, no. As far as I'm concerned, he won't have to know about any of this. \nTODD Well, that's impossible. \nNEIL Bullshit! Nothing's impossible. \nTODD Well, why don't you just call him and ask him? And m-maybe he'll say yes. \nNEIL That's a laugh! \nNeil tosses the blanket back onto his bed. \nNEIL If I don't ask him, at least I won't be disobeying him. \nTODD Yeah, but if he said-- \nNEIL (shouting angrily) Jesus, Todd! Whose side are you on? \nTodd says nothing. Neil looks at him for a moment and then takes the flyer back from Todd. He walks over to the window, his excitement gone. \nNEIL I mean, I haven't even gotten the part yet. Can't I even enjoy the idea for a little while? \nOnce again, Todd says nothing. After a moment, Neil sits on the heater and Todd returns to his poem. \nNEIL You're coming to the meeting this afternoon? \nTODD I don't know. Maybe. \nNEIL Nothing Mr. Keating has to say means shit to you, does it, Todd? \nTODD W-What is that supposed to mean? \nNEIL You're in the club! Being in the club means being stirred up by things. You look about as stirred up as a cesspool. \nNeil gets up from the window and stands over Todd. \nTODD So- You want me out? \nNEIL No! I want you in, but being in means you gotta do something. Not just say you're in. \nTODD Well, listen, Neil. I-I appreciate this concern, but I-I'm not like you. All right? You, you, you say thing and people listen. I'm, I'm not like that. \nNEIL Don't you think you could be? \nTODD No! I--I, I don't know, but that's not the point. The, the, the point is that there's nothing you can do about it, so you can just butt out. I can take care of myself just fine. All right? \nNEIL No. \nTODD What do you mean, \"no\"? \nA smile comes to Neil's face. \nNEIL No. \nNeil grabs Todd's notebook of poetry and runs across the room with it. Todd leaps up after him. \nTODD Give me-- Neil. Neil, give that back. \nThe two begin racing in circles around the room, jumping from bed to bed as Todd tries to grab his poem back. \nNEIL \"We are dreaming of a--\" Poetry! I'm being chased by Walt Whitman! Okay, okay. \nNeil drops the notebook. Cameron walks into the room. \nCAMERON What are you guys doing? I'm sure-- You see this chemistry- \nCameron tries to hold up his book and Neil snatches it from his hands and suddenly all three of them are racing around the room. \nKEATING That's it. Wonderful. Wonderful. \nKeating removes his hands from Todd but Todd keeps his eyes closed. \nTODD And, and all the time he's mumbling. \nKEATING What's he mumbling? \nTODD M-Mumbling, \"Truth. Truth is like, like a blanket that always leaves your feet cold.\" \nThe students begin to laugh and Todd opens his eyes. Keating quickly gestures for him to close them again. \nKEATING Forget them, forget them. Stay with the blanket. Tell me about that blanket. \nTODD Y-Y-Y-You push it, stretch it, it'll never be enough. You kick at it, beat it, it'll never cover any of us. From the moment we enter crying to the moment we leave dying, it will just cover your face as you wail and cry and scream. \nTodd opens his eyes. The class is silent. Then they begin to clap and cheer. \nKEATING (whispering to Todd) Don't you forget this. \nEXT. SOCCER FIELD - DAY \nKeating's students are playing a soccer game. After they score the winning goal they hoist Keating onto their shoulders and carry him away. \nINT. CAVE - DAY \nThe boys are all sitting around the cave lighting their pipes. CHARLIE Attaboy, Pittsie, inhale deeply. \nMEEKS My dad collects a lot of pipes. \nCHARLIE Really? Mine's got thirty. \nPITTS Your parents collect pipes? Oh, that's really interesting. \nCHARLIE Come on, Knox. Join in. \nMEEKS Yeah, Knox, we're from the government. We're here to help, man. \nCHARLIE What's wrong? \nPITTS It's Chris. Here's a picture of Chris for you. \nPitts holds up a centerfold. \nMEEKS Smoke that. Put that in your pipe and smoke it. \nKNOX That's not funny. \nCHARLIE Knock it off. Smoke your pipes. \nMEEKS Neil! \nNeil enters the cave carrying a beat up light stand. \nNEIL Friend, scholar, Welton men. \nMEEKS What is that, Neil? \nPITTS Duh. It's a lamp, Meeks. \nNeil removes the shade from the lamp, revealing the shape of a man as the base of the lamp. \nNEIL No. This is the god of the cave. \nMEEKS The god of the cave. \nCharlie begins making loud noises with his saxophone. \nPITTS Charlie, what are you doing? \nCHARLIE What do you say we start this meeting? \nBOY 1 Y-Yeah, just-- I need a light. I just gotta- \nBOY 2 Got my earplugs? \nCharlie stands up and clears his throat. \nCHARLIE Gentlemen, \"Poetrusic\" by Charles Dalton. \nCHRIS (O.S.) Okay. Bye. \nKNOX Thank you. I'll see you. Bye. \nKNOX Yawp! Can you believe it? She was gonna call me. She invited me to a party with her. \nCHARLIE At Chet Danburry's house. \nKNOX Yeah. \nCHARLIE Well? \nKNOX So? \nCHARLIE So, you don't really think she means you're going with her? \nKNOX Well, of course not, Charlie. But that's not the point. That's not the point at all. \nCHARLIE What is the point? \nKNOX The point, Charlie, is, uh-- \nCHARLIE Yeah? \nKNOX that she was thinking about me. I've only met her once, and already she's thinking about me. Damn it. It's gonna happen, guys. I feel it. She is going to be mine. Carpe. Carpe! \nKnox flips his scarf dramatically around his neck as he walks away and climbs the stairs. \nEXT. COURTYARD - DAY \nThe students are standing in a line while Cameron, Pitts, and Knox are walking in a circle. Keating watches as they go around. \nKEATING No grades at stake, gentlemen. Just take a stroll. \nAfter a few moments, the three boys begin to march to the same beat. \nKEATING There it is. \nThe other boys start clapping to the rhythm of their steps. \nKEATING I don't know, but I've been told-- \nBOYS I don't know, but I've been told-- \nKEATING Doing poetry is old-- \nBOYS Doing poetry is old-- \nMr. Nolan looks out at them from his office as Keating joins the boys and begins marching with them. \nKEATING Left, left, left-right-left. Left, left, left-right-left. Left, halt! \nThe boys come to a halt. \nKEATING Thank you, gentlemen. If you noticed, everyone started off with their own stride, their own pace. \nKeating begins walking very slowly. \nKEATING Mr. Pitts, taking his time. He knew he'll get there one day. Mr. Cameron, you could see him thinking, \"Is this right? It might be right. It might be right. I know that. Maybe not. I don't know.\" \nKeating begins walking with his groin pushed forward. \nKEATING Mr. Overstreet, driven by deeper force. Yes. We know that. All right. Now, I didn't bring them up here to ridicule them. I brought them up here to illustrate the point of conformity: the difficulty in maintaining your own beliefs in the face of others. Now, those of you -- I see the look in your eyes like, \"I would've walked differently.\" Well, ask yourselves why you were clapping. Now, we all have a great need for acceptance. But you must trust that your beliefs are unique, your own, even though others may think them odd or unpopular, even though the herd may go, \"That's baaaaad.\" Robert Frost said, \"Two roads diverged in a wood and I, I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.\" Now, I want you to find your own walk right now. Your own way of striding, pacing. Any direction. Anything you want. Whether it's proud, whether it's silly, anything. Gentlemen, the courtyard is yours. \nThe students begin walking about, some walking casually, others making up silly walks. Keating notices that Charlie is still leaning up against one of the pillars. \nKEATING You don't have to perform. Just make it for yourself. Mr. Dalton? You be joining us? \nCHARLIE Exercising the right not to walk. \nKEATING Thank you, Mr. Dalton. You just illustrated the point.

Excuse- Excuse me. \nCHARLIE Guys, I have an announcement to make. In keeping with the spirit of passionate experimentation of the Dead Poets, I'm giving up the name Charlie Dalton. From now on, call me Nuwanda. \nPITTS (laughing) Nuwanda? \nNEIL Nuwanda? \nTina takes out a tube of red lipstick. Charlie takes it from her and puts red marks on each of his cheeks. \nINT. CHET'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nKnox enters the house and looks anxiously about. \nKNOX Hello? Hello, Chris? \nKnox stops and combs his hair in the hallway mirror. Chris comes running out from one of the rooms. \nCHRIS Knox! \nKNOX Hi. \nCHRIS You made it. Great! Bring anybody? \nKNOX No. \nChris grabs Knox by his jackets and pulls him forward as she walks toward the stairs. \nCHRIS No. Ginny Danburry's here. Wait. I have to go find Chet. Why don't you go downstairs where everybody is? \nChris runs up the stairs as Knox stares after her. \nCHRIS Make yourself at home. \nKNOX But I-- \nINT.

Sorry, guys. \nBUBBA (obviously drunk) Where's your manners Steve? Mutt Sanders' brother, we don't even offer him a drink. Here. Go have some whiskey, pal. \nBubba hands Knox a glass and fills it up. \nSTEVE Yeah. \nKNOX Whoa, I, uh, I don't really drink-- \nBUBBA To Mutt. \nSTEVE To Mutt. \nThe two guys raise their glasses in a toast and Knox reluctantly joins them. \nKNOX To Mutt. \nThey each take a big drink. Knox rolls his eyes and gasps, loosening his tie to try and breathe. \nKNOX Now, Chet, I know this looks bad, but you've gotta- \nChet throws himself at Knox, hurling them both to the floor. He then straddles Knox and begins to punch at him as Knox simply tries to protect himself. \nCHRIS Chet, no! You'll hurt him! No! No! Stop it! Leave him alone! \nCHET Goddamn! \nCHRIS Chet, stop it! \nChris manages to haul Chet away from Knox. \nCHET Bastard! \nKnox takes his hands away from his face and feels at his bloody nose. Chris tries to help him up. \nCHRIS Knox, are you all right? \nCHET Chris, get the hell away from him! \nCHRIS Chet, you hurt him! \nCHET Good! \nKNOX I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. \nCHRIS It's okay. It-It's okay. \nChet hauls Chris away from Knox and then points at him. \nCHET Next time I see you, you die. \nINT. CAVE - NIGHT \nTina passes a bottle of alcohol to Neil. \nTINA Go ahead, pass it around. \nCameron motions for Neil not to take it but Neil takes a swig anyway. There is a moment of awkward silence. \nMEEKS Me and Pitts are working on a hi-fi system. It shouldn't be that hard to, uh, to put together. \nPITTS Yeah. Uh, I might be going to Yale. Uh, uh, but, I, I might not. \nGLORIA Don't you guys miss having girls around here? \nMEEKS AND PITTS (smiling) Yeah. \nCHARLIE That's part of what this club is about. In fact, I'd like to announce I published an article in the school paper, in the name of the Dead Poets. \nCAMERON What? \nCHARLIE Demanding girls be admitted to Welton. \nPITTS You didn't. \nCHARLIE (whispering to Meeks) So we can all stop beating off. \nNEIL How did you do that? \nCHARLIE I'm one of the proofers. I slipped the article in. \nMEEKS Look, uh, it's, it's over now. \nCHARLIE Why? Nobody knows who we are. \nCAMERON Well, don't you think they're gonna figure out who wrote it? They're gonna come to you and ask to know what the Dead Poets Society is. Charlie, you had no right to do something like that. \nCHARLIE It's Nuwanda, Cameron. \nGLORIA That's right. It's Nuwanda. \nCHARLIE Are we just playing around out here, or do we mean what we say? For all we do is come together and reach a bunch of poems to each other. What the hell are we doing? \nNEIL All right, but you still shouldn't have done it, Charlie. This could mean trouble. You don't speak for the club. \nCHARLIE Hey, would you not worry about your precious little neck? If they catch me, I'll tell them I made it up. \nINT. ASSEMBLY HALL - DAY \nMR.

Many of the boys get up from their seats. \nKEATING It's all right, gentlemen. \nCHARLIE Mr. Keating. \nKEATING Mr. Dalton. That was a pretty lame stunt you pulled today. \nCHARLIE You're siding with Mr. Nolan? What about Carpe diem and sucking all the marrow out of life and all that? \nKEATING Sucking the marrow out of life doesn't mean choking on the bone. Sure there's a time for daring and there's a time for caution, and a wise man understands which is called for. \nCHARLIE But I thought you'd like that. \nKEATING No. You being expelled from school is not daring to me. It's stupid, 'cause you'll miss some golden opportunities. \nCHARLIE Yeah. Like what? \nKEATING Like, if nothing else, the opportunity to attend my classes. Got it, Ace? \nCHARLIE Aye, aye, Captain. \nKEATING Keep your head about you. That goes for the lot of you. \nBOYS Yes, Captain. \nKEATING Phone call from God.

Before you say anything, please let me ex- \nMr. Perry rises from the desk. \nMR. PERRY Don't you dare talk back to me! It's bad enough that you've wasted your time with this, this absurd acting business. But you deliberately deceived me! How, how, how did you expect to get away with this? Answer me. Who put you up to it? Was it this new man? This, uh, Mr. Keating? \nNEIL No. Nobody-- I thought I'd surprise you. I've gotten all A's in every class. \nKEATING Well, you have to talk to him before tomorrow night. \nNEIL Isn't there an easier way? \nKEATING No. \nNEIL I'm trapped. \nKEATING No, you're not. \nEXT.

Do you know where she is? \nGIRL Um, I think she's in room 111. \nThe girl points down the hallway and Knox sets off in that direction. \nKNOX Thanks. \nChris is at her locker talking to a friend. She just closes her locker as she notices Knox coming towards her. She turns away. \nKNOX Excuse me. Chris. \nCHRIS Knox, what are you doing here? \nKNOX I came to apologize for the other night. I brought you these and a poem I wrote for you. \nChris pulls him aside, out of the main hallway. \nCHRIS Knox, don't you know that, if Chet finds you here he'll kill you? \nKNOX I can't care. I love you, Chris. \nCHRIS Knox, you're crazy. \nKNOX Look, I acted like a jerk and I know it. Please, accept these. Please. \nCHRIS No. No-- I, I can't. Forget it. \nChris walks away. The school bell rings and she enters her classroom, closing the door behind her. Undaunted, Knox follows, opening the door and standing before her desk. \nCHRIS Knox, I don't believe this. \nKNOX All I'm asking you to do is listen. \nAs Knox begins to read his poem, the classroom grows quiet as everyone stops to listen. \nKNOX The heavens made a girl named Chris With hair and skin of gold.

Did you read it to her? \nKNOX Yeah. \nThe boys begin to get all excited but Charlie shushes them. \nCharlie hustles the boys away. Meeks remains staring at her. Charlie returns to drag him away. \nKNOX Chris, you can't be in here. I-If they catch you, we're both gonna be in big trouble. \nCHRIS Oh, but it's fine-- \nKnox shushes her and leads her out the door. \nEXT. CAMPUS - NIGHT \nSnow is lightly falling as Chris and Knox walk outside. \nCHRIS It's fine for you to come barging into my school and make a complete fool out of me? \nKNOX I didn't mean to make a fool out of you. \nCHRIS Well, you did. Chet found out. And it took everything I could do to keep him from coming here and killing you. Knox, you have got to stop this stuff. \nKNOX I can't, Chris. I love you. \nCHRIS Knox, you say that over and over. You don't, you don't even know me. \nKeating calls out from a nearby car. \nKEATING Will you be joining us, Mr. Overstreet? \nKNOX Go ahead, Captain. I'll walk. \nCHRIS Knox, Knox, it just so happens that I could care less about you? \nKNOX Then you wouldn't be here warning me about Chet. \nCHRIS I have to go. I'm gonna be late for the play. \nKNOX Are you going with him? \nCHRIS (laughs) Chet? To a play? Are you kidding? \nKNOX Then come with me. \nCHRIS Knox, you are so infuriating. \nKNOX Come on, Chris. Just give me one chance. If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever. \nCHRIS Uh-huh. \nKNOX I promise. Dead Poets Honor. You come with me tonight. And then, if you don't want to see me again, I swear I'll bow out. CHRIS You know what would happen if Chet found out? \nKNOX He won't know anything. We'll sit in the back and sneak away as soon as it's over. \nCHRIS And I suppose you would promise that this would be the end of it. \nKNOX Dead Poets Honor. \nCHRIS What is that? \nKNOX My word. \nChris walks away from him and then turns to face him. \nCHRIS You are so infuriating. \nChris gestures for Knox to follow her. Charlie does a little twirl as he joins her and puts his arm around her. They walk away. \nINT. THEATER - NIGHT \nThe audience is packed. The stage is set up to resemble a forest and lights dance about it. From behind a bush, Neil emerges, wearing a crown of twigs and berries and twigs on his hands. In the audience, Charlie emerges from his seat, all excited. \nCHARLIE Hey, there he is! Hey, hey. \nCameron shoves him back into his seat. \nKEATING Shh, boys. \nOn stage, Neil hides behind a tree as a girl emerges, similarly clad, but with flowers in her hair. Neil sneaks over to the girl. \nFAIRY \nEither I mistake your shape and making quite, Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite Call'd Robin Goodfellow: \nNeil nods in agreement. \nACTOR What did you think? \nWOMAN Really I thought you were all just wonderful! \nNeil emerges from the curtains, carrying his costume.

Mrs. Perry watches through the window as her husband and son arrive and then takes a nervous puff on her cigarette before sitting down. Mr. Perry walks in with Neil close behind him. Neil sits down beside the desk while Mr. Perry remains standing. \nMR. PERRY We're trying very hard to understand why it is that you insist on defying us. Whatever the reason, we're not gonna let you ruin your life. Tomorrow I'm withdrawing you from Welton and enrolling you in Braden Military School. You're going to Harvard and you're gonna be a doctor. \nNEIL But that's ten more years. Father, that's a lifetime! \nMR. PERRY Oh, stop it. Don't be so dramatic. You make it sound like a prison term. You don't understand, Neil. You have opportunities that I never even dreamt of and I am not going to let you waste them. \nNeil rises to his feet. \nNEIL I've got to tell you what I feel. \nMrs. Perry stands up. \nMRS.

He stops and stares out at the snow-covered surroundings. \nTODD It's so beautiful. \nTodd begins to gag and then goes down on his knees, vomiting into the snow. The other boys huddle around him, hugging him. \nCHARLIE Todd. It's okay, Todd. \nPITTS Calm down. \nCHARLIE It's all right, Todd. \nPITTS Todd, it's okay. It's okay, Todd. \nCHARLIE It's all right.

NOLAN The death of Neil Perry is a tragedy. He was a fine student. One of Welton's best. And he will be missed. We've contacted each of your parents to explain the situation.

He's in Nolan's office right now, finking. \n", "test1_input": "CHARLIE \nTeach me to love? Go teach thyself more wit. I, chief professor, am of it. \nNeil gets up and looks over Charlie's shoulder to see what he is reading. \nCHARLIE The god of love, if such a thing there be, may learn to love from me. \nCharlie winks at the guys and they clap and cheer. \nNEIL Wow! Did you write that? \nCharlie turns over the centerfold to show where he had written down the poem. \nCHARLIE Abraham Cowley. Okay, who's next? \nNeil sits reading from the book by flashlight. \nNEIL Alfred Lord Tennyson. Come my friends, 'Tis not too late to seek a newer world for my purpose holds to sail beyond the sunset. And though we are not now that strength which in old days Moved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are;-- One equal temper of heroic hearts, Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will. To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield. \nMeeks takes center stage and begins reading a poem like he is performing a chant. \nMEEKS Then I had religion, then I had a vision. I could not turn from their revel in derision. Then I saw the Congo creeping through the black, cutting through the forest with a golden track. Then I saw the Congo creeping through the black- \nCHARLIE Meeks, Meeks. \nMEEKS \n...cutting through the forest with a golden track.

And don't use very sad, use- \nHe points to the back of the classroom. \nKEATING Come on, Mr. Overstreet, you twerp, KNOX Morose? \nKEATING Exactly! Morose. Now, language was developed for one endeavor, and that is? Mr. Anderson? Come on! Are you a man or an amoeba? \nKeating stands before Todd's desk. Todd looks up nervously but says nothing. Keating paused for a moment before looking away. \nKEATING Mr. Perry? \nNEIL Uh, to communicate. \nKEATING No! To woo women. Today we're going to be talking about William Shakespeare. \nThe class lets out a collective sigh. BOY Oh, God! \nKEATING I know. A lot of you looked forward to this about as much as you look forward to root canal work. We're gonna talk about Shakespeare as someone who writes something very interesting. Now, many of you have seen Shakespeare done very much like this: \nKeating holds out his right arm dramtically and begins to speak in an exaggerated British accent. \n\"O Titus, bring your friend hither.\" But if any of you have seen Mr. Marlon Brando, you know, Shakespeare can be different. \"Friend, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears.\" You can also imagine, maybe, John Wayne as Macbeth going, \"Well, is this a dagger I see before me?\" \nINT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY \nThe students are all seated together near the front of the room as Keating reads from a book. \nKEATING \"Dogs, sir? Oh, not just now. I do enjoy a good dog once in a while, sir. You can have yourself a three-course meal from one dog.

I stand upon my desk to remind yourself that we must constantly look at things in a different way. \nKeating glances around the classroom from atop the desk. \nKEATING You see, the world looks very different from up here. You don't believe me? Come see for yourself. Come on. Come on! \nCharlie and Neil quickly rise from their seats to go to the front of the classroom. The rest of the class follows them. While Keating continues speaking, Neil and Charlie join him on the desk and then Keating jumps down. \nKEATING Just when you think you know something, you have to look at it in another way. Even though it may seem silly or wrong, you must try! Now, when you read, don't just consider what the author thinks. Consider what you think. \nKEATING Boys, you must strive to find your own voice. Because the longer you wait to begin, the less likely you are to find it at all. Thoreau said, \"Most men lead lives of quiet desperation.\" Don't be resigned to that. Break out! \nKeating notices Spaz and another boy leaving the desk immediately. \nKEATING Don't just walk off the edge like lemmings. Look around you. \nThe school bell rings as the boys continue to climb onto the desk. Keating begins to gather up his stuff. The clock begins to toll as Keating walks to the back of the class. \nKEATING There! There you go, Mr. Priske. Thank you! Yes! Dare to strike out and find new ground. Now, in addition to your essays, I would like you to compose a poem of your own, an original work. \nThe students begin to groan. Keating begins flickering the lights off and on while chanting ominously. \nKEATING That's right! You have to deliver it aloud in front of the class on Monday. Bonne chance, gentlemen. \nKeating steps out into the hall before quickly peeking back in once again. Todd is the last one to stand on the desk and is about to jump off. \nKEATING Mr. Anderson? Don't think that I don't know that this assignment scares the hell out of you, you mole. \nKeating flicks the light off, leaving Todd to jump down in the darkness as the students laugh. \nEXT.

I'm gonna play Puck! \nHe pounds on Charlie's door. \nMEEKS What did he say? \nPITTS Puck? \nNEIL That's the main part. \nKNOX Great, Neil. \nNEIL Charlie, I got it! \nCHARLIE Congratulations. Good for you, Neil. Good for you. \nNeil enters his room with Todd and sits down at his typewriter. \nNEIL Okay, okay, okay, okay. \nTODD Neil, how are you gonna do this? \nNEIL They need a letter of permission from my father and Mr. Nolan. \nTODD You're not gonna write it. \nNEIL Oh yes, I am. \nTODD Oh, Neil.

Blight light shines from her eyes. But life is complete; contentment is mine, Just knowing that... \nSeveral students begin to snicker. \nKNOX just knowing that she's alive. \nKnox crumples his poem and walks back to his desk. \nKNOX Sorry, Captain. It's stupid. \n", "test2_true": "Hopkins slowly walks to the front of the class and unfolds his piece of paper. \nHOPKINS \"The cat sat on the mat.\" \nKEATING Congratulations, Mr. Hopkins. Yours is the first poem to ever have a negative score on the Pritchard scale. We're not laughing at you, we're laughing near you. I don't mind that your poem had a simple theme. Sometimes the most beautiful poetry can be about simple things, like a cat, or a flower or rain. You see, poetry can come from anything with the stuff of revelation in it. Just don't let your poems be ordinary. Now, who's next? \nKeating approaches Todd's desk. \nKEATING Mr. Anderson, I see you sitting there in agony. Come on, Todd, step up. Let's put you out of your misery. \nTODD I, I didn't do it. I didn't write a poem. \nKEATING Mr. Anderson thinks that everything inside of him is worthless and embarrassing. Isn't that right, Todd? Isn't that your worst fear? Well, I think you're wrong. I think you have something inside of you that is worth a great deal. \nKeating walks up to the blackboard and begins to write. \nKEATING \"I sound my barbaric yawp over the rooftops of the world.\" W. W. Uncle Walt again. Now, for those of you who don't know, a yawp is a loud cry or yell. Now, Todd, I would like you to give us a demonstration of a barbaric \"yawp.\" Come on. You can't yawp sitting down. Let's go. Come on. Up. \nTodd reluctantly stands and follows Keating to the front. \nKEATING You gotta get in \"yawping\" stance. \nTODD A yawp? \nKEATING No, not just a yawp. A barbaric yawp. \nTODD (quietly) Yawp. \nKEATING Come on, louder. \nTODD (quietly) Yawp. \nKEATING No, that's a mouse. Come on. Louder. \nTODD Yawp. \nKEATING Oh, good God, boy. Yell like a man! \nTODD (shouting) Yawp! \nKEATING There it is. You see, you have a barbarian in you, after all. \nTodd goes to return to his seat but Keating stops him. \nKEATING Now, you don't get away that easy. \nKeating turns Todd around and points out a picture on the wall. \nKEATING The picture of Uncle Walt up there. What does he remind you of? Don't think. Answer. Go on. \nKeating begins to circle around Todd. \nTODD A m-m-madman. \nKEATING What kind of madman? Don't think about it. Just answer again. \nTODD A c-crazy madman. \nKEATING No, you can do better than that. Free up your mind. Use your imagination. Say the first thing that pops into your head, even if it's total gibberish. Go on, go on. \nTODD Uh, uh, a sweaty-toothed madman. \nKEATING Good God, boy, there's a poet in you, after all. There, close your eyes. Close your eyes. Close 'em. Now, describe what you see. \nKeating puts his hands over Todd's eyes and they begin to slowly spin around. \nTODD Uh, I-I close my eyes. \nKEATING Yes? \nTODD Uh, and this image floats beside me. \nKEATING A sweaty-toothed madman? \nTODD A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain. \nKEATING Oh, that's excellent. Now, give him action. Make him do something. \nTODD H-His hands reach out and choke me. \n", "test2_id": 1309, "test3_input": "INT. HALLWAY - DAY \nTodd is lead up the steps to Mr. Nolan's office by Hager. \nINT. NOLAN'S OFFICE - DAY \nTodd enters the room to see his mother and father seated opposite Mr. Nolan's desk. \nMR. ANDERSON Hello, son. \nMRS. ANDERSON Hello, darling. \nTODD Mom. \nTHe door closes behind Todd. He remains standing, not knowing what to do. \nMR. NOLAN Have a seat, Mr. Anderson. \nTodd sits down next to his parents. \nMR. NOLAN Mr. Anderson, I think we've pretty well put together what's happened here. You do admit to being a part of this Dead Poets Society? \nTodd says nothing. \nMR. ANDERSON Answer him, Todd. \nTODD Yes, sir. \nMr. Nolan puts his glasses on and glances at a paper before him before removing his glasses once more. \nMR. NOLAN I have here a detailed description of what occurred at your meetings. It describes how your teacher, Mr. Keating, encouraged you boys to organize this club and to use it as a source of inspiration for reckless and self- indulgent behavior. It describes how Mr. Keating, both in and out of the classroom, encouraged Neil Perry to follow his obsession with acting when he knew all along it was against the explicit order of Neil's parents. It was Mr. Keating's blatant abuse of his position as teacher that led directly to Neil Perry's death. \nMr. Nolan motions to Todd's father, who passes along a sheet of paper to Todd. \nMR. NOLAN Read that document carefully, Todd. Very carefully. \nTodd looks at the paper, which already contains the signatures of the other four boys. \nMR. NOLAN If you've nothing to add or amend, sign it. \nTODD What's gonna happen to Mr. Keating? \nMR. ANDERSON I've had enough. Sign the paper, Todd. \nMr. Nolan holds out a pen for Todd to take. \nEXT. CAMPUS - DAY \nMr. McAllister leads his students, textbooks in hand, through the snow outside the classrooms. \nMcALLISTER Grass is gramen or herba. Lapis is stone. The entire building is aedificium. \nKeating looks out from his office window. McAllister pauses and looks up at Keating, giving him a brief wave. Keating waves back. \nINT. KEATING'S OFFICE - DAY \nKeating laughs slightly as he watches McAllister from the window. Inside, all his belongings have been packed up. \nINT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY \nThe students are all seated at their desks in silence. Everyone looks as the door opens. They quickly stand as Mr. Nolan enters the room. \nMR. NOLAN Sit. \nThe students sit once again as Mr. Nolan walks to the front of the room. \nMR. NOLAN I'll be teaching this class through exams. We'll find a permanent English teacher during the break. Who will tell me where you are in the Pritchard textbook? \nMR. NOLAN Mr. Anderson? \nTODD Uh, in the, in the Pr- \nMR. NOLAN I can't hear you, Mr. Anderson. \nTODD In the, in the, in the Pritchard? \nMR. NOLAN Kindly inform me, Mr. Cameron. \nCAMERON We skipped around a lot, sir. We covered the Romantics and some of the chapters on Post Civil War literature. \n", "test3_true": "CAMERON I believe we skipped most of that, sir. \nMR. NOLAN All right, then, we'll start over. What is poetry? \nThere is a knock at the classroom door. \nMR. NOLAN Come. \nThe students look back as the door opens. They quickly turn away when hey see it is Keating. \nKEATING Excuse me. I came for my personals. Should I come back after class? \nMR. NOLAN Get them now, Mr. Keating. \nMR. NOLAN Gentlemen, turn to page 21 of the introduction. Mr. Cameron, read aloud the excellent essay by Dr. Pritchard on \"Understanding Poetry.\" \nTodd slowly closes his book. Keating opens the door to the tiny room off the classroom. \nCAMERON That page has been ripped out, sir. \nMR. NOLAN Well, borrow somebody else's book. \nCAMERON They're all ripped out, sir. \nMR. NOLAN What do you mean, they're all ripped out? \nCAMERON Sir, we, uh- \nMR. NOLAN Never mind. \nMr. Nolan takes his own book over to Cameron's desk and then slaps the open page. \nMR. NOLAN Read! \nAs Cameron begins to read, Keating looks out at Todd as he puts his scarf on. Todd looks at him for a moment and then glances away. \nCAMERON \"Understanding Poetry by Dr. J Evans Pritchard, Ph.D. To fully understand poetry, we must first be fluent with its meter, rhyme and figures of speech, then ask two questions: 1) How artfully has the objective of the poem been rendered and 2)...\" \nThe door squeaks as Keating shuts it behind him. Cameron pauses. \nCAMERON \"... How important is that objective? Question 1 rates the poem's perfection; question 2 rates its importance. And once these questions have been answered, determining the poem's greatness becomes a relatively simple matter. If the poem's score for perfection is plotted on the horizontal of a graph--\" \nKeating passes by Todd and the others and gets to the back of the classroom before Todd leaps up from his seat and turns to face him. \nTODD Mr. Keating! They made everybody sign it. \nMr. Nolan gets up from his desk and approaches Todd. \nMR. NOLAN Quiet, Mr. Anderson. \nTODD You gotta believe me. It's true. \nKEATING I do believe you, Todd. \nMR. NOLAN Leave, Mr. Keating. \nTODD But it wasn't his fault! \nMR. NOLAN Sit down, Mr. Anderson! \nTodd reluctantly returns to his seat. \nMR. NOLAN One more outburst from you or anyone else, and you're out of this school! Leave, Mr. Keating. \nKeating hesitates at the back of the classroom. \nMR. NOLAN I said leave, Mr. Keating. \nKeating slowly turns and heads to the door. As he opens it, Todd, stands upon his desk and turns to Keating. \nTODD O Captain! My Captain! \nMR. NOLAN Sit down, Mr. Anderson! \nKeating pauses at the door and looks back at Todd on his desk. \nMR. NOLAN Do you hear me? Sit down! Sit down! This is your final warning, Anderson. How dare you? Do you hear me? \nAfter a moment of indecision, Knox climbs up onto his desk. \n", "test3_id": 1310}

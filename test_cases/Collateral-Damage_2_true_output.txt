Matt's coffin is taken from Gordy.    As it is lowered... 
A third bagpiper, farther away still, begins playing the song with the other two. One by one the first and second bagpipers finish their rounds, until there is just the third -- a haunting, mournful wail off into the distance. And then... 
There's only silence. 
58   INT. GORDY'S APARTMENT - MATT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                 58 
Gordy stands at an open closet door. He leans in, buries his face in Matt's clothes and smells them. Smells his son. 
59   INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                        59 
The TV is ON LOW, tuned to the NEWS.    Gordy is alone, slumped in a chair. 
60   NEWS ANCHOR                                                     60 
NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.) ... The bombing that left a mother and son dead and New York City numb took on a new dimension today when a notorious Latin American terrorist took credit for the attack. 
61   GORDY                                                         61

NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.) In an e-mail to the New York Times, a Marxist extremist known only as 'The Wolf,' states that the bombing was, quote, 'not an act of terror but an act of war, aimed at stopping your C.I.A. murderers and their fascist puppets from committing further acts of repression against the people of Colombia,' unquote... Two Colombian officials and an American military officer died in last Thursday's blast. Also killed were Anne Pitt, wife of a New York City firefighter, and their only child, four-year-old Matt... The President has vowed that the United States will avenge what he called 'this monstrous act of barbarism and cowardice'... Intelligence sources say the identity and whereabouts of The Wolf remain a mystery. They believe he has worked closely with radical elements in Latin America for more than twenty years and have linked him to numerous terrorist bombings, including the 1983 downing of a Peruvian airliner, which killed forty-two people, eleven of them Americans... The head of the Latin America Indigenous People's Committee, a group known to be sympathetic to the radicals in Colombia, talked to News Six in Queens. 
63   GORDY                                                         63 
watches as Ephraim Ortiz-Dominguez a Latin man in his forties, comes on the screen. 
64   ORTIZ-DOMINGUEZ                                               64 
ORTIZ-DOMINGUEZ (V.O.) I cannot speak for The Wolf or his actions. I would only repeat that the leftist guerrillas in Colombia are not terrorists but freedom fighters in a war being waged against them by the U.S. and Colombian governments. Governments who wish only to protect a system that lines the pockets of corrupt politicians and multi-national profiteers. (jump cut) The deaths of the woman and little boy are regrettable, but your government inflicts them all the time. Yugoslavia, Iraq... You call it 'collateral damage'... 
65   INT. VACANT SECOND-FLOOR OFFICE (QUEENS) - NIGHT              65 
An FBI SURVEILLANCE TEAM has taken over the office. Three agents work video and audio recording devices. 
A camera points out the window to a line of storefronts across the street. The lights are on in one building with a sign reading "IPC" (Indigenous People's Committee). 
The FBI agents listen to live audio from the IPC office. 
ORTIZ-DOMINGUEZ (V.O.) Rosetta, I said mustard on the side. You'll have to go back. 
FBI SURVEILLANCE AGENT Know what cracks me up about commies? They're all 'equality this, equality that,' and they're all chauvinists. Listen to that fucking guy. 
What they hear, however, is ROSETTA SCREAM as a DOOR CRASHES open. 
ORTIZ-DOMINGUEZ (V.O.) What do you want? 
GLASS SHATTERS. THINGS are BROKEN. 
66   VIDEO MONITORS                                                66 
The video monitors show Gordy wrecking the IPC office with a baseball bat. 
67   INT. IPC OFFICE - NIGHT                                         67 
Gordy smashes office equipment left and right. ORTIZ- DOMINGUEZ and ROSETTA cower as Gordy vents his pent-up, end-of-the-world rage using the bat the way we saw him use a fire axe. 
Gordy approaches Ortiz-Dominguez with the bat.      Backs him up against a desk. 
ORTIZ-DOMINGUEZ Please... 
The FBI agents crash in. 
FBI SURVEILLANCE AGENT Mr. Pitt! 
Gordy just stares down at Ortiz-Dominguez. 
FBI SURVEILLANCE AGENT This isn't the way to do things. 
Gordy still doesn't move. 
FBI SURVEILLANCE AGENT These guys're only mouthpieces. 
Beat.   Then Gordy swings the bat.   Hard.   And... 
Destroys the computer monitor next to Ortiz-Dominguez. 
Gordy tosses the bat aside.    To the shaking Latin -- 
GORDY How's that for collateral damage? 
68   INT. FBI (NEW YORK) - PHIPPS' OFFICE - NIGHT                    68 
Gordy sits across from Phipps.    Dray is present. 
PHIPPS Mr. Ortiz-Dominguez has agreed not to press charges if you make full restitution. 
GORDY I've already paid. With my family. 
Beat.   Phipps sees it's pointless to insist.   To Dray -- 
PHIPPS Take care of it. 
(CONTINUED) 
68   CONTINUED:                                                    68 
Dray heads out, passing Mike Brandt, who enters. 
PHIPPS Gordy, this is Mike Brandt. 
BRANDT Mr. Pitt. 
Gordy just looks at him. 
BRANDT I'm very sorry for your loss... I lost people, too.

HOLLAND Sonofabitch. 
But he has a plan. His plan is to try to make it out of the house in one piece. What was once careful stalking has turned into panicked blundering. 
CONTINUE TRACKING Holland as he bumps into things, knocking them over, retreating wildly. He passes a raging fireplace and suddenly out of the shadows comes a voice: 
STORM (O.S.) How does it feel to know you're about to die? 
Holland FIRES in the direction of the voice, and Storm comes out of the shadows standing in plain view -- his .45 pointed at Holland. 
STORM I'll give you more time than you and Trent gave my wife.

Holland changes the point of his aim and FIRES again.    As he fires, Storm EMPTIES his GUN straight at Holland. 
WALL BEHIND HOLLAND 
A Louis XIII portrait -- where a silver dollar-sized group of holes has just appeared, two inches above Holland's head. They are both out of ammo. 
STORM'S POV 
Holland picks up a fireplace poker. He's swinging like maniac and we hear the sound of the poker SLASHING the AIR. 
But he gets too close to Storm, who snatches the poker away from him. 
They are like two vicious cats whirling. We see Holland gasping in agony and hear the sound of BONES BREAKING. 
Storm then begins the search for Trent. He casually strolls through the house calling as if he's playing hide and seek with a childhood friend. 
STORM Vernon, oh, Verrrrrnon, where are you? 
Storm opens closets, looks in drawers, under the toilet seat, and then proceeds into -- 
INT. MASTER BEDROOM 
STORM (loud enough for Trent to hear) Let's see ... where could that bad boy be? 
From the tragic violent rage to what almost seems like a kiddie game, we are not sure if: Storm has gone mad or what. He approaches the master closet as he continues the taunting melody. 
MASTER CLOSET 
Storm enters and begins pushing the clothes of the racks aside -- looking for something that's probably not there. Trent is too smart for this shit ... he's probably on a jet to the Bahamas by now.

One more rack of clothes in the farthest-back section. Storm reaches to shove it aside when, with shocking and deafening suddenness: a SHOTGUN BLAST erupts point-blank ... shredding $10,000 worth of suit jackets and barely missing Storm's head. Instantly a figure leaps out. Storm gently disarms him, and the two men are for a moment frozen eye to eye. 
STORM AND TRENT 
Storm seems to drift off somewhere far away, and then violently slams Trent up against the wall, pinning his chest with the left hand. Storm takes the sawed-off shotgun by the handle and punches the barrel straight into Trent's mouth. The barrel simply goes through the teeth and in his mouth. It appears Storm has made up his mind about what to do. Trent's eyes bug out of his head. 
Storm now takes Trent by the hair and leads him through the house, shotgun still in his mouth. 
STORM You know, Trent, I want to kill you so bad I can barely contain myself. But I keep thinking that death is far too merciful a fate for you, and that a nice petite white-bread boy like you in a federal penitentiary ... (pause) -- let me put it this way -- I doubt whether you could remain anal retentive for very long. Yeah... I think that's best for you -- 
Trent is now so fucking scared he looks like he is about to go out of his mind. About this time in their journey through the house, Storm has stopped before Holland's mangled and lifeless body. If you think Trent was scared before, you should see him now. 
Storm curiously turns his back on Trent for a moment, to pick up handcuffs off the floor. Trent sees his last chance. 
Trent seizes the poker and does his most mighty Babe Ruth impression. Just as Storm stands up, the poker comes flying. It looks like Storm is dead but somehow he steps inside the arc and does shihonage, which disarms Trent and flips him backwards head-first into the fire. 
Trent's neck is impaled by one of the decorative iron arrows of the fireplace. He is stuck -- struggling to free himself from the arrow as his head catches fire ... a fate somewhat worse than prison.

Storm turns away -- 
FADE OUT. 
FADE IN: 
EXT. CEMETERY - LONG SHOT - DAY 
We are not sure where we are yet. In   the distance, we see a procession of marching men, all  wearing kilts, and all the accoutrements of traditional  Scottish garb. In the front, several paces ahead of the  neatly marching lines of men, is a single BAGPIPER.   Behind all of them is a hearse, being nobly escorted by  mounted police. 
FULL SHOT 
Now we see them fully: the colors, the feeling, the emotion of caring men marching in the funeral parade of a fallen comrade. 
CAMERA PAN'S OVER to reveal a section of mourners -- mostly police but with some civilians. The CAMERA MOVES CLOSER and PANS TO the front row, where we see Storm in full police regalia, a medal of valor around his neck. Andy and Sonny are standing near at sober attention.

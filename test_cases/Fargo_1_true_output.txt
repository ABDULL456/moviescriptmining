SCOTT Dad, I really think we should call the cops. 
JERRY No!  We can't let anyone know about this thing!  We gotta play ball with these guys - you ask Stan Grossman, he'll tell ya the same thing! 
SCOTT Yeah, but - 
JERRY We're gonna get Mom back for ya, but we gotta play ball.  Ya know, that's the deal.  Now if Lorraine calls, or Sylvia, you just say that Mom is in Florida with Pearl and Marty... 
Scotty starts to weep again.  Jerry stares down at his lap. 
JERRY ...  That's the best we can do here. 
EXT. CABIN 
It is a lakeside cabin surrounded by white.  A brown Ciera with dealer plates is pulling into the drive. 
Grimsrud climbs out of the passenger seat as Carl climbs out of the driver's.  Grimsrud opens the back door and, with an arm on her elbow, helps Jean out.  She has her hands tied behind her and a black hood over her head. 
With a cry, she swings her elbow out of Grimsrud's grasp and lurches away across the front lawn.  Grimsrud moves to retrieve her but Carl, grinning, lays a hand on his shoulder. 
CARL Hold it. 
They both look out at the front lawn, Grimsrud expressionless, Carl smiling. 
With muffled cries, the hooded woman lurches across the unbroken snow, staggering this way and that, stumbling on the uneven terrain. 
She stops, stands still, her hooded head swaying. 
She lurches out in an arbitrary direction.  Going downhill, she reels, staggers, and falls face-first into the snow, weeping. 
CARL Ha ha ha ha ha ha!  Jesus! 
Grimsrud, still expressionless, breaks away from Carl's restraining hand to retrieve her. 
BRAINERD POLICE HEADQUARTERS 
We track behind Marge as she makes her way across the floor, greeting various officers.  She holds a small half-full paper sack. 
Beyond her we see a small glassed-in cublcle.  Norm sits at the desk inside with a box lunch spread out in front of him. There is lettering on the cubicle's glass door:  BRAINERD PD. CHIEF GUNDERSON. 
Marge enters and sits behind the desk, detaching her walkie- talkie from her utility belt to accomodate the seat. 
MARGE Hiya, hon. 
She slides the paper sack toward him. 
NORM Brought ya some lunch, Margie. What're those, night crawlers? 
He looks inside. 
The bottom of the sack is full of fat, crawling earthworms. 
MARGE Yah. 
NORM Thanks, hon. 
MARGE You bet.  Thanks for lunch.  What do we got here, Arbie's? 
NORM Uh-huh. 
She starts eating. 
MARGE ...  How's the paintin' goin'? 
NORM Pretty good.  Found out the Hautmans are entering a painting this year. 
MARGE Aw, hon, you're better'n them. 
NORM They're real good. 
MARGE They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them. 
NORM Yah, ya think? 
He leans over and kisses her. 
MARGE Ah, ya got Arbie's all o'er me.

{"train": "Tatiana puts the key around Anastasia's neck and they embrace. Then, suddenly . . . \nON THE GRAND CHANDELIER \nthe lights begin to fade in and out. \nGROUP SHOT \nas PEOPLE in the ballroom look around bewildered. Then, a WHIRLWIND kicks up, sending everyone off the dance floor, as the whirlwind becomes a TORNADO. \nSuddenly, an ALBINO BAT (BARTOK) with huge eyes, springs out of the funnel, screeching and swooping over the crowd, causing everyone to duck and cover their heads in fear. \nThe tornada reaches it's peak and EXPLODES in smoke - leaving RASPUTIN standing alone in the middle of the floor. He is of indeterminate age, towering over other men in the room, his most striking feature are his eyes - which at this moment are burning a fiery red. He is dressed in a flowing black monk's robe with a satin rope tied around his waist. Connected to the rope is a glowing RELIQUARY, a mystical lantern. \nVARIOUS SHOTS \nof Nicholas, Alexandra, Sophie and Vladimir, Dmitri peeking out ofthe wallpanel, Tatiana and Anastasia, all of whom are frightened. \nNICHOLAS \nas he gathers his son and wife to his side \nNICHOLAS Rasputin!  You're alive . . . \nRASPUTIN (advancing) Despite being shot, poisoned and thrown into an icy river . . . YES! \nNICHOLAS (honestly) I had nothing to do with it! \nRASPUTIN You gave the orders! \nNICHOLAS I did no such thing! \nRASPUTIN After all I've done for your family - YOU TRIED TO KILL MEEEEEE ! ! ! \nRasputin swings the reliquary, wrapping himself in smoke which seems to grow larger. Eerie moaning noises come from the reliquary. PEOPLE back awayin terror. \nRASPUTIN (CONT.) The Romanov dynasty ends here! You, your wife and children will all die within the fortnight! \nANASTASIA NO! \nAnastasia leaves Tatiana and rushes to stand in front of her father. Still holding her Music Box, Anastasia's shaking hands are the only thing that gives away her fear. Rasputin spins toward the voice. \nANASTASIA We're not afraid of you! \nRASPUTIN (furious) You . . .  my little babushka . . . you'll be so much fun to kill that I'll save you for last! \nTwirling the reliquary again, the MOANS grow louder as Bartok circles around his head. The smoke that emerges seems to have almosy a human shape to it. \nRASPUTIN THIS IS THE END OF THE ROMANOV LINE - FOREVER !!!! \nThe tornada of smoke begins again, whipping into a frenzy and then EXPLODING. \nDMITRI No - this way! \nDmitri runs to a wall panel and thows his weight against it. It opens, revealing a passage way. \nDMITRI (CONT.) Go!  Run!!  Out the servant's quarters! \nTatiana, enormously grateful, looks at Dmitri as he flips his hair out of his face unconsciously. \nDMITRI Go! \nTatiana goes in as Dmitri shoves Anastasia toward the passageway, knocking the music box out of her hand.  She reaches for it, but hearing the mob voices growing closer, he pushes her through the panel without it. \nDMITRI (CONT.) Go! \nTatiana quickly follows Anastasia into the passageway and Dmitri closes the panel JUST AS the mob bursts in. \nDMITRI (CONT.) (lying to the mob) No one's here! Let's try the next room! \nThe MOB, accepts the word of a peasant boy and rushes out. Dmitri picks up the music box and looks sadly toward the panel. \nEXT. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT \nWhich is under siege by ROYALISTS trying to board the overcrowded train and the REVOLUTIONARIES who are trying to stop them. \nA TOURING CAR pulls up RIGHT ON THE TRACKS behind the caboose as the train starts to pull away. \nTatiana and Anastasia climb out of the car and race for the train, fighting their way through the frenzied and frightened crowd. WE HEAR shouts of \"The Empress - let her through!\" which helps clear the way. \nAnastasia reaches the train first, then turns to see Tatiana. trying to catch up. \nANASTASIA Hurry, Grandmama! \nTATIANA Get on! Anastasia, get on! \nAnastasia refuses to board the train. \nUP AHEAD \nA MOB OF REVOLUTIONARIES block the tracks with a TRUCK \nON ANASTASIA \nwho pushes Tatiana up the stairs of the caboose. This puts Anastasia a few steps behind as the train speeds up. Tatiana is gripped by other passengers as she reaches out to Anastasia. \nTATIANA Grab my hand! \nAnastasia reaches up and takes Tatiana's hand. \nANASTASIA Don't let go! \nCLOSE ON \nAnya smiles lovingly at the children. \n\"A SOMEPLACE AND A SOMEONE\" \n(Anya's \"I want\" song).  Anya SINGS SOFTLY to the children about how all she has is the key around her neck to the \"someone and thesomeplace\" she was \"lost from long ago\".  She tells the children that she must go find them again. \nUNDERSCORE continues. \nANYA I have to go now, before it gets light. \nGREGOR (worried) But what if we can't ever find where we came from?! \nANYA Then you'll have to make your own home. Lots of people do. \nAnya embraces the children and walks to the window. \nGREGOR (nervous, sad) Anya! What if we can't find anyone who loves us?! \nANYA Then come find me. \nGregor is relieved and cuddles into his bed as Anya smiles lovingly and crawls out the window. \nEXT.  ORPHANAGE - NIGHT \nAnya begins to climb down the street, testing the knots. The knotshold tight, but the old sheet RIPS in half, sending her PLUMMETING into a snow drift.  From the depths of the snow we HEAR her voice. \nANYA (O.C.) I hope there's no snow in Paris. . . \nEXT.  HILLSIDE - DAWN \nA glorious bright (and cold) dawn creeps over the horizon. Anya stands at  edge of the hill, looking down on the city of ST.PETERSBURG. The old gray orphanage looms behind her. Anya \"borrows\" an old, beat-up bicycle from the orphanage and rides down the hill. \nMusic picks up in energy and excitement as Anya zooms on her way bumping and bouncing downhill as the sunrises and St. Petersburg looms nearer. \n\"A SOMEONE AND A SOMEPLACE\" (CONT.) \nMusic becomes UPTEMPO, HOPEFUL, ACTIVE, ACTIVE. Anya SINGS - - full of hope, energy and excitement as she peddls her rickety bike toward the city. \"Her heart is on its way\" and nothing is going to stop her. \nAnya passes though the countryside toward the city. A peasant family waves to her as she goes by. A Gypsy Troupe performs tricks by the side of the road. A very fancy car zooms by. \n\"A SOMEONE AND A SOMEPLACE\" (CONT.) \nAnya SINGS, imagining who she might be -- anyone from a peasant to a princess! But it doesn't matter as long as she finds her real family. \nPeople stare at her as she rides into the edge of the city. She is captivated by all the activity:  cars, busses, stores, long lines of people, etc. \n\"A SOMEONE AND A SOMEPLACE\"  (CONT.) \nAnya SINGS -- in this sea faces, there must be someone who has a clue to her identity.  She'll stop at nothing to find the someone who once loved her.  SOARING MUSICAL AND VOCAL CONCLUSION. END MUSICAL NUMBER \nAnya does not see a cute little PUPPY (MEETOO) with a HUGE BONE in his mouth, being chased along the sidewalk by a pack of much larger, vicious DOGS until he bolts across Anya's path forcing her to skid to a stop. She watched him as he scoots into an alley, followed by the angry pack. \nANYA To Paris. I have to get to Paris \nPEASANT 5, in front of her, turns around. \nPEASANT 5 Paris?!  What do they have in Paris that they don't have here? \nPEASANT 6 Shorter lines?! \nPeasant 6 is immediately carted off by TWO ARMED GUARDS for his blasphamy against the state. \nPEASANT 7 (quietly) Nobody leaves Soviet Russia. \nThe OTHER PEASANTS join in with variations of \"Nobody leaves Russia\" as Anya reaches the window and speaks to the clerk. \nANYA Is this where I get traveling papers? \nCLERK It would be if we let you travel which we  don't so it isn't. (loudly, for all to hear) Russia is the people's paradise! \nAnd to further make his point, he slams shut his window, which immediately opens a crack as he whispers to Anya. \nCLERK (CONT.) See Dmitri. He can help. \nHe shuts the window, only to open it again immediately. \nCLERK (CONT.) But you didn't hear it from me. \nHe shuts the window. \nANYA (doesn't get it) I didn't \nHe opens it again. \nCLERK No. \nThe clerk sticks out a sign:  \"Samovar Break - back in ten minutes\" and slams the window shut. \nEXT.  BUREAU OF BUREAUCRACY \nAnya steps out of the building, still not seeing Meetoo and looks around at the hoards of people waiting in lines for everything:  bread, gas, clothes, etc. \nANYA (to herself) Dmitri? There must be a million Dmitris. . . \nFOLLOW ANYA \nas she wades into the crowded street. Meetoo getting tangled in the legs of waiting Soviets. \nAnya stops suddenly. She sniffs the air.  Her eyes widen as she recognizes the stench that is floating through the air.  She spins around and sees Serebreakov DIRECTLY ACROSS THE STREET. \nSerebreakov is on a mission to find Anya.  He turns in her direction just as a bus passes.  Anya is gone. \nWe now see Anya clinging to the side of the bus as it drives down the street. Meetoo looks, his face dropping - he knows he'll never catch up to her now.  Then he sees the bus hit a huge pothole and Anya is knocked off into the mud.  Happily, Meetoo trots off in her direction. \nINT.  ST. PETERSBURG ART THEATRE \nThe waiting room is filled with YOUNG WOMEN, of various shapes and sizes, holding reading aloud from a piece of paper. WE HEAR many variations of \"Oh, Grandmama! It's me, Anastasia. I've waited so long to see you\". \nINT.  STAGE \nAn ACTRESS stands in front of what looks to be an OLD WOMAN in a shawl who's back is to the \"audience\". \nACTRESS 1 (over the top) Oh, Grandmama! It's me, Anastasia! I've waited so long to see you! \nThe Actress then LUMBERS over to the OLD WOMAN, with a gait like John Wayne. \nREVERSE ANGLE \nto see the \"Old Woman\" is Vladimir, with a shawl over his head.  He looks older, of course, but with the same dapper mustache. He rolls his eyes. \nVLADIMIR (out to audience) Dmitri!  I can not work with her! (MORE) \nVLADIMIR (CONT.) (to Actress) May I remind you that you are supposed to be Princess - not a lazy lumbering lout! \nIN THE SEATS \nis Dmitri. Now 20 and darkly handsome. His hair still falling in his eyes as he flips it off his forehead. \nDMITRI Vladimir, calm down! \nVladimir walks off the stage and toward Dmitri. \nVLADIMIR This, my friend, as an exercise in futility! We shall never find a girl to play the Princess Anastasia out of this motley crew of commoners! \nVladimir dramatically throws one end of his shawl over his shoulder. \nDMITRI For a ten million rubles reward we can look a little longer. This is the big one. . .  and all I need is the right girl. \n\"A SOMEONE AND A SOMEPLACE\"  (REPRISE \n(Dmitri's \"I want\") Dmitri SINGS a reprise of Anya's song, a COMIC VERSION, in which he expresses the hope that he can find the right girl for his scam. Anyone from a peasant to a princess will do, as long as she can fool Tatiana. (NOTE:   We don't want to give Dmitri a whole new song here or we'll be too song-heavy in Act I. By giving him a short reprise of Anya's song, we can effectively align these two characters emotionally.) \nQUICK CUTS: \nof various aspirants: \nACTRESS 2 (heavy hasal) Oh, Grandmama! It's me, Anastasia. I've waited so long to see you. \nDMITRI (O.C.) Next! \nACTRESS 3 (stupid) Oh. . .  Grandmama it's me. Anastasia, I have waited so long, too. (as a good-bye) See you! \nDMITRI (O.C.) Next! \nACTRESS 4 looks like a hooker and sounds like Mae West. \nThey walk out the door. \nEXT.  ST. PETERSBURG ART THEATRE - CONTINUOUS \nDMITRI She could be right under our nose \nAnya is running up the stairs as Dmitri walks out and they COLLIDE:  her forehead banging Dmitri literally under his nose.  Dmitri grabs his upper lip in pain. \nDMITRI (over reacting) Ouch!  That really hurt! \nANYA I'm sorry. . .  I'm. . . \nDMITRI That's quite a hard head you've got there, boy. \nIn her old hand-me-down boys clothes andhat pulled low, she could easily be mistaken for a boy. \nANYA (breathless) I'm looking for Dmitri.  I need traveling papers - to Paris. I heard Dmitri could help me. \nVladimir and Dmitri exchange a look. . .  wary. . .  Dmitri looks around and motions to Vladimir to handle it while he walks ahead nonchalantly. \nVLADIMIR Who did you hear it from? \nANYA I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them!   Do you know Dmitri? \nDmitri keeps walking ahead followed by Vladimir. Anya is determined not to give up and keeps up with Vladimir even though she keeps getting bumped and pulled off track by people walking in the opposite direction. \nVLADIMIR (loudly, acting) Providing travel papers is illeagal! (then, quietly) I know Dmitri well - perhaps I can help you.  Providded you have enough money to pay for this service. . . \nANYA Well, I don't have any money . . . \nVLADIMIR Good day! \nVladimir pats her on the head and walks away. \nANYA I have a bike!  Perhaps I could sell it and. . . \nVladimir keeps walking, catching up to Dmitri. \nAnya runs back around to the front of the building where she left her bike.  She stops suddenly when she realizes that there is no bicycle there anymore - just Meetoo. \nANYA (CONT.) What are you doing here?  And where's my bike? \nA POLICEMAN strolls by. \nANYA (CONT.) Officer!  My bike has been stolen! \nPOLICEMAN Nonsense.  There is no crime in the Soviet Socialist Republic. \nAnd he keeps walking. Anya realizes that there is no hope in pursuing the policeman so she heads off to find Vladimir - who has vanished down the street.  Meetoo starts to follow her. \nANYA Sorry, boy, I have to go. \nDMITRI (off noise) What was that? \nVLADIMIR That was your dinner!  I do hope there is no cabbage in Paris! \nINT.  BALLROOM \nBARTOK Whatta' ya say we go somewhere - maybe get a bug to eat.  Get it?  A \"bug\" to eat, 'cause we're. . . \nFEMALE BAT rolls her eyes in disgust and flaps away. \nBARTOK (CONT.) (one last try) I'm a Gemini. . . \nHe hears the SOUND of boards being torn off the window. \nBARTOK'S HIGH ANGLE POV \nAnya climbs into the ballroom. \nINT.  SMALL ROOM \nMeetoo manages to wiggle in after her and follows Anya as she wanders around, spell bound by the faded glory of the palace. \nINT. DINING ROOM \nAnya wanders into the partially destroyed room and bends down to inspect half of a broken plate that's lying on the floor. The instant she touches it, she pulls her hand away as if SHOCKED.  Recovering, she picks it up. \nCLOSE ON PLATE \npainted with decorative dancing Russian bears. \nAnya wanders out of the room and to the top of a HUGE STAIRCASE which leads down to the once grand BALLROOM. She stops at a large landing half way down the steps. Meetoo sees a large curtain hanging precariously on the side wall.  Being a puppy he can't resist leaping and grabbing at it with his teeth.  Anya notices and runs her hand along a the carved butterflies in the worn banister. \nON ANYA \nwho jumps, startled, as Meetoo pulls the curtain and it hits  the floor. \nINT.  PALACE BEDROOM \nDmitri and Vladimir look up from their burnt cabbage. They heard it too. \nINT.  STAIRCASE (BALLROOM) \nAnya is relieved to see it is only Meetoo, who wags his tail happily with the curtain still in his mouth. \nANYA What are you do. . . \nAnya STOPS mid sentence, taken by what she sees. \nANYA'S POV \nBehind the curtain was the FRIEZE of the ROMANOV FAMILY. The moonlight hits the portrait with a ghostly glow. \nDMITRI Look! \nVladimir looks at Anya again and get it. \nANYA Are you Dmitri?  I didn't  mean to trespass - I don't want to do anything dishonest, but if you could just help help me. . . \nVladimir and Dmitri walk down the stairs and up her stairs and begin to circle around her. \nVLADIMIR Perhaps you heard of our brilliant plan to find a girl and. . . \nDmitri pokes him hard in the ribs and shakes his head. \nDMITRI (quietly to Vlad) She doesn't want to do anything \"dishonest\". . . \nVLADIMIR (gets it, whispers) Ew. . .  the honest type. \nDmitri gives Vlad a \"let me handle this\" gestures. \nDMITRI (off frieze) You look like her.  Like the Princess Anastasia.  Has anyone ever told you that before? \nAnya is coming back to her senses, doesn't like these men circling her. \nANYA (sarcastic) Oh, yeah - in the orphanage they constantly told me I looked like a princess! Stop that! \nDmitri stops circling and then begins to use everything that Anya says - the perfect and charming con man that he is - to get what he wants. \nDMITRI People say Anastasia was the only member of the Royal Family to escape alive.  That makes her an orphan too (MORE) \nDMITRI (CONT.) (beat) What happened to your parents? \nANYA I don't know - I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . . \nDMITRI You know, it's strange - Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution.  Why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother? \nANYA I don't know.  I don't see what this has to do with me. \nDMITRI Perhaps it's because she has amnesia too - can't remember. . . \nVLADIMIR How much do you weigh? \nDmitri pokes him again. \nVLADIMIR (CONT.) (to Dmitri) I was just wondering since we already have the dress. . . \nANYA Look, I came here to get papers to travel to Paris and. . . \nDMITRI Why do you want to go to Paris? \nANYA (defiant) I have my reasons. \nDMITRI Anastasia's grandmother is in Paris.  We're going to bring Anastasia to her - in Paris. (MORE) \nSCARY NUMBER in whIch he SINGS of his obsession with killing the Romanovs once and for all. Bartok will interject comically throughouut. as Rasputin will conjure up tLis minions from the iquary and sing about Romanovs FINALE, he sends them off after Anya. \nSONG TO INCORPORATE THE FOLLOWING SENTIMENTS: \nRASPUTIN The Romanovs tried to kill me and I swore to destroy all of them! If she lives, if she should have a child someday, the Romanov Family continues! And I won't lot that happen! THIS IS THE END OF THE LINE! \nHe crushes the Anastasia doll in his massive hand. \nBARTOK You know, this is really obsessive behavior. There is this doctor this doctor in Austria, Sigmund something and he feels. . . \nBartok land on the table while be's talking and his wing accidently knocks the RELIQUARY on its side and it begins to roll. \nRASPUTIN YOU IDIOT \nRasputin makes a sad leap, grabbing it seconds before it shatters on the floor.\tRasputin holds it up. The smokey SPIRITS inside swirl around, moaning. \nRASPUTIN (CONT.) (to Reliquary) Yesses - you'd all like to get out, wouldn' t you? Sorry just one at a time and only when I call. \nRasputin spins an Bartok, who Us been slinki away, and slams a goblet over his. \nBARTOK'S POV \nFrom under the glass, Rasputin looks distorted and even more horrifying. \nRASPUTIN (to Bartok) Do you have any idea what would happen if that broke?! \nBARTOK (voice under glass) You'd lose your security deposit? \nRASPUTIN (waving reliquary) Evil, powerful beings - I have their power only if I contain them, control them. If they should all be released at once... well ... \nRasputin smiles with his horrible yellow, decayed teeth, and lifts the glass an if to whisper in Bartok, a ear. \nRASPUTIN (CONT.) YOU DON'T WANT TO BE AROUND IF THAT HAPPENS! \nThe volume of Rasputin's voice rattles Bartok around the inside of the glass. Rasputin focuses on the RELIQUARY. \nRASPUTIN (CON'T.) (to reliquary) Where is she? Where is Princess Anastasia... \nInside the reliquary the awoke begins to mow Suddenly, the smoke EXPLODES in a burst and forms into the smoke from a train engine. As the reliquary picture broadens, we see a train and Anya, Dmitri and Vladimir all hurrying to catch it. \nRASPUTIN(CONT.) She has friends. No matter... \nBartok looks desperate under glass. He trios to topple the glass prism by jumping up but just cooks his head. \nBARTOK Ohhh, that was dumb... \nBARTOK (CONT.) (calling to Rasputin) Hello, I've get really terrible claustrophobia. That's why I could never live in a cave ... \nRasputin gives his attention only to the reliquary. \nRASPUTIN Finish my prophecy... \nDMITRI Hurry up with those papers. \nVLADIMIR Would you have leaned over Rembrant's shoulder and told him to paint faster? \nVladimir looks at Dmitri's anxious face. \nVLADIMIR (CONT.) You probably would. (hands his the papers) They're still wet. \nA TRAIN WHISTLE SLOWS and Vlad Moves to Anya. \nVLADIMIR (CONT.) Wake up, young lady, that's our train. \nDMITRI (correcting) \"Wake up, your highness\" - we should start getting used to saying it. \nVLADIMIR What a world - a man who was in my position in society is calling a peasant 'Your Highness\". \nDmitri leans over and tugs Anya's hair lightly. \nDMITRI (to Anya) Wake up! \nAnya's  eyes flash open and - totally on reflex - she belts Dmitri in the nose. Ditri reels back,  lands on his butt - Vladimir observes ruefully. \nVLADIMER We have a lot of work to do... \nEXT. TRAIN PLATFORM - SECONDS LATER \nVladimir, using his ample belly, bumps people out of the way as they head for the train. Vlad climbs on just as it starts up, followed\tby Dmitri. Dmitri turns back and reaches out his hand to help Anya up. But she freezes... just STANDS THERE, not running. \nANYA'S POV \nDMITRI Come on! \nDmitri on the train, his band extended - just like Tatiana's was. Although Anya can't quite remember, something about this terrifies bar. She snaps out of it when Meetoo nips her ankle. \nAnya looks down and sees the puppy, picks his up and runs for the train. \nDMITRI Take my hand! \nAnya puts Meetoo into his hands and Jumps on without touching his. \nINT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT \nThe compartment is JAMMED with travelers. Suitcases and packages balanced precariously. Dmitri sits down and carefully touches his painful noso. \nDMITRI Do you always punch people first thing in the morning? \nANYA Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging. \nDMITRI I wasn't bothering you. I was trying to wake you up! \nOVER ANYA'S SHOULDER, out of the window. we see the THREE MINIONS on horseback charging down a snow covered hill toward the train. \nAs the Guard heads out of the compartment, Vlad turns to Dmitri and they exchange an \"oh, no\" look. \nINT. CORRIDOR, ANOTHER CAR \nThe MINIONS, hoods pulled low, push their way through the PASSENGERS in search of Anastasia. \nINT. CORRIDOR \nDmitri spots the GUARD conferring with the GUARDS over the papers. Anya pokes bar head out. \nANYA I'm going to stretch my legs \nDMITRI That's a good idea - a great idea - stretch your legs (pointing the opposite direction of the guards) ... stretch then that way. \nAnya looks at him like he's crazy and walks away. \nANYA (to herself) I must have hit him harder than I thought... \nDmitri runs back in and grabs his SMALL BACKPACK. He pulls Vlad, carrying Meetoo, out off the compartment Anya has a load on them as they follow. \nINT TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY \nThe GUARDS burst in, ready for an arrest. In the background, the hooded Minions pass. The Guards, seeing empty seats, head back out. \nINT. TRAIN CORRIDOR - ANOTHER CAR \nAnya looks out the window as the country side flies by and smiles. \nINT. CORRIDOR \nThe Guards spot three figures at the far end of the car. \nGUARD That's them! Come on! \nThey run after who they think are the fugitives. The Guard grabs a minion and spins him around. \nIt's MINION THREE, who comes face-to-beak with him and lets out a HORRENDOUS SCREECH, causing the other Minion to turn around. The Guards scream and reel backward, pushing and shoving each other to got out of the way \nThe Minions proceed up the corridor, MINION TWO, spot Anya looking out the window. He grabs her. palling her viciously to the other Minions. She spins around - it isn't Anya - it's a SERIOUSLY UGLY WOMAN. The Minions now scream and reel back in horror. \nINT. CORRIDOR - SIMULTANEOUS \nDmitri and Vladimir catch up to Anya and grab her in each arm, loading bar down the hall WE HEAR the MINIONS SCREAM from the next car. \nEXT. BETWEEN CARS \nAnya. Dmitri and Vlad step out on a platform and see there is no place left to run. Only the engine is ahead of them. \nDMITRI Wait here! \nHe leaps up gracefully, grabbing the edge of the roof, and pull& himself up. \nON THE MINIONS \nnow on the roof, seeing their prey in short distance. \nON ANYA AND THE OTHERS \nrunning, without looking back. jumping from car to car, passing Meetoo like a football. Vladiair makes a huge running leap into the air... \nINT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT \nAs all PASSENGERS react to Vladimir's bulk hitting and denting the coiling. \nEXT. ROOF OF TRAIN \nThe TRAIN WHISTLE erupts and Anya glances back to see her pursuers just as they are enveloped in the thick black smoke of the engine. Behind them, Anya can another tunnel. \nTUNNEL \nThey drop down, this time Vlad in on his stomach. Anya and Dmitri realize his butt won't clear the tunnel. They push it down. \nON THE MINIONS \nAn the smoke disappears, the Minions' eyes go wide when they realize it's too late for them. The train roars the tunnel as the MINIONS SMASH &\"'not the sift of \nthe mountain in a COLORFUL BURST OF SMOKE from which they were created. \nINT. RASPUTIN'S WAGON - PARALLEL TIME \nDISSOLVE TO \nEXT.\tROOF OF TRAIN - DAY \nRasputin stares at the scene in his reliquary, watching his well laid plan *go up in smoke\", and lots out a simmering growl. \nAnya is standing with her hands an her hips arguing with Dmitri and Vladiair. \nANYA Forged papers! Now, what?! \nDMITRI Now just get off the train. \nANYA HUH?! \nDmitri motions that they are going to Jump. Anya shakes her head slowly. \nANYA Noooo.... \nVLADIMIR She's quite right, Dmitri, a man of my stature should not have to \nDmitri shoves him off the top of the train with Meetoo in his arm. Dmitri then puts out his hand to Anya. \nDMITRI Come on, we'll jump together... Take my hand. \nRasputin, on his obsessed mission, leaps on top of the wagon as Bartok, still dizzy, tries to catch up. \nRASPUTIN We'll catch her and finish her! (he grabs the, reigns) We ride this night! \nRasputin then looks down and sees that there are no horses harnessed he gave then to the begins a slow growl. \nBARTOK Well,\twe wait this night! \nEXT.\tCOUNTRY - BREAK OF DAWN \nAnya is walking ahead with Vladiair as Dmitri follows he's still muddy, wet and unhappy. \nVLADIMIR No have a lot of work to do, Anya! Come along, Meetoo! \nMeetoo is trying to catch fire flies in his mouth. \nVLADIMIR (CONT.) We have to prepare you for an audience with Sophie. \nANYA Who's Sophie? \nVLADIMIR (lost in warm memories) Ah ... the Lady Sophie... The ravishing first cousin, once removed, from the Empress. We must convince Sophie that you are the Princess before we'll be granted a meeting with the Empress ... your grandmother, I mean. \nAnya stops dead in her tracks, this is the first she's heard of this. \nANYA What?! \nDmitri, not paying attention, slams into the back of Anya. Anya, not hurt, turns to Dmitri - who is rubbing his now sore shoulder. \nANYA (CONT.) You never said anything to me about having to prove I'm a Princess! \nDMITRI You are the Princess. \nVLADIMIR We're just going to refresh your memory... \nANYA I don't have a memory and I'm not a Princess! (looks down at herself) Even if I were - no one's ever going to believe it. I'm not exactly... \nAnya searches for the -word as she sits down next to a frozen pond. \nANYA (CONT.) (sadly to herself) ... good enough... (to others) I can't go through with this! \nDmitri sits next to Anya and looks at her reflection in the ice. \nDMITRI What do you see? \nANYA'S POV \nher smudged face and boy's clothes. Dmitri's hands come into frame, wipe off her face with snow and them pull her hair off her face. Anya does, truly, look pretty. \nDMITRI(CONT.) See? The Princess is under there ... \nVLADIMIR Ah! Let us begin! \nMeetoo spots TWO UGLY PUG DOGS and a distinguished ELDERLY DOWAGER. He runs happily to play with them. She pulls her DOGS away from Meetoo. \nELDERLY DOWAGER No, no, boys! You don't know where he's been! \nThey give him a disgusted look and walk away. Meetoo looks a little hurt. \nINT. HALLWAY OF THE SHIP - NIGHT \nDmitri and Vladimir are standing by a closed door. Anya is on the other side. \nANYA (0. C.) No! I look ridiculous! \nVLADIMIR Come out! I can do alterations. \nANYA (O.C.) You'll laugh. \nVLADIMIR I shant! \nANYA (O.C.) Not you. Him. \nDMITRI I won't laugh - I swear... \nThe door opens and Anya comes out in the blue dress Dmitri stole which at least ten sizes too big for her. She is still wearing her hair up and despite the size which actually gives her a \"Kate Moss\" waifish look with her men's boots and baggy dress - the blue brings out her eyes. Dmitri sees her and BUSTS OUT LAUGHING. \nANYA You said you wouldn't laugh! \nDMITRI It's not you - it's the dress! \nAnya storms back into the cabin and slam the door behind her. \nINT.\tCABIN - SIMULTANEOUS ACTION \nWhen Anya storms into the cabin, she catches a glimpse of herself in the mirror. \nANYA (to herself) I'm never going to be.. \nJust then, the slamming door catches the back of her dress, pulling more than half of it into the door frame. She sees in the mirror that the now fitted dress shows a lovely woman's figure. Pleased, she looks at herself. \nANYA (CONT.) Well! Maybe I am... \nEXT.\tCABIN DOOR - NIGHT \nVladimir and Dmitri wait outside the door. The door opens and Anya appears, having tied the veil around the waist of the dress, making it look fitted and beautiful. Dmitri and Vladimir are surprised as Anya walks past them with confidence and throws them a look over her shoulder. \n\"REPRISE OF VLADIMIR'S SONG (OVER MONTAGE) \nThe tone of the song would now change - - the older, wiser person watching as two younger people are unwittingly falling in love. The tone can still be light, as are the visuals here, but there would be an undercurrent of irony and romance. The song would end as Anya and Dmitri have their first, momentary embrace. \nMONTAGE: (MOS) \nON DECK: Anya, still in her boots, walks gracefully down the deck in spite of the ship's rocking motion. Dmitri and Vlad can't even stand due to the motion. Anya looks back and flashes them a smile. \nEXT.\tSEA CLIFF - NIGHT \nThe wagon sits on the edge of a high cliff. Rasputin stands on the top of his wagon, staring at the sea demonically. The jagged bolts of lightening and the icy silver rain make him look all the more menacing. \nRASPUTIN (low, slow) She's out there ... \nThe wind parts his beard and we see Bartok hanging upside down in it, trying to stay out of the storm. \nBARTOK I'm getting a chest cold.. \nRASPUTIN Bartok... a question. \nBARTOK I'm getting pneumonia. I have a fever. Feel my forehead... \nRASPUTIN What do you think is the most humiliating way to die? \nRasputin's eyes light up as if he just thought of the answer to his own question. Bartok is thrown out of his beard when he makes a sudden turn and leaps off the wagon. Bartok follows. \nBARTOK My cousin Mischa, nice fellow had some dental problems - you didn't want to watch him eat, let's put it that way... \nRasputin steps in \nINT.\tWAGON - NIGHT \nAs Bartok continues, Rasputin moves to the reliquary's cabinet. \nBARTOK ... anyway, a bunch of other bats were hanging in the belfry - I know, cliche, but there you have it, and Mischa, not the brightest bat in the world, decides to hang in the bell. Which was fine for awhile until it started ringing ... (shivers) Ewwww, what a mess ... \nRASPUTTN (to reliquary) Show her to me ... \nBARTOK And it didn't help the tonal quality of the bell, either. \nIMAGES, horrifying and frightening, begin to spin into a small tornado. Rasputin throws open the door and the TORNADO bursts out streaking across the water. \nEXT.\tSEA CLIFF - NIGHT \nRasputin follows tornado to the cliff and watches as it disappears into the horizon of the water. Lightning and thunder crash as he laughs maniacally. \nINT.\tCABIN - NIGHT \nwhich is swaying with the storm. PAN past Vladimir, snoring, his now limp mustache flopping wildly and past Dmitri, sleeping restlessly. Move to Anya, who seems quite content. \nFrom under the door SMOKY IMAGES silently slither. They float across the cabin and swirl around Anya. \nCLOSE ON: \nAnya's CLOSED EYES as the SMOKY IMAGES seem to enter her head. She smiles in her sleep and we are in ANYA'S DREAM. . . \nEXT.\tFOREST - DAY \nAnya, in a beautiful white dress, is walking peacefully through a sunny part of a lovely forest on a spring day. She reaches down to pick some pretty flowers, then looks up as it seems to get dark... OMINOUS LOOKING CLOUDS cover the sun. Anya reaches down for another flower when she HEARS A GROWL. \nDMITRI If you have to go - wake her.. \nDmitri looks over to Anya's bed - she isn't sits up and throws his legs over the side \nEXT. DECK \nAnya is standing right on the edge of death... \nIN HER DREAM \nShe isn't there. He of his bed. \nthe FAMILY is waving to her. NICHOLAS waves for her to jump into the clear pond and join them. Anya nods and moves to jump in... \nEXT. DECK \nAnya gets ready to jump into the violent and icy black waves. She takes one step out when... DMITRI GRABS HER SHOULDERS. \nAnya JOLTS awake from her dream. Confused at first, then terrified to see what almost happened to her. isn't lifts her to the other side of the railing and looks at her. \nDMITRI What were you doing?! \nAnya puts her hands to her mouth in shock, shaking and almost crying with fear, she throws her arms around Dmitri and holds him tightly. \nDmitri is surprised at first, but tightens his arms around her. \nDMITRI (CONT.) It's okay now - I've got you. You're safe... \nThey stand steady on the deck in a tight embrace, their feelings for each other are stronger than the storm. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nTHE SAME, as seen through the reliquary \nRasputin watches ... seething quietly, as Bartok peeks meekly over his shoulder. \nBARTOK Boy, don't you hate it when that happens? \nRASPUTIN (controlling) She leads a charmed life, that little one ... Someone is always there to save her. In the palace as a child, on the train and now ... it's him. \nRasputin studies Dmitri in the reliquary - Dmitri and Anya still in a warm embrace. \nBARTOK Nice looking fellow. I mean, don't get me wrong - I'm not attracted to him in the physical sense, I just ... \nBut Rasputin's not interested, he stares into the reliquary and speaks directly to it. \nRASPUTIN You are toying with me, aren't you? You let me get so close... \nThe reliquary, as if in answer, seem to be chuckling. Rasputin smiles and joins in with it. \nRASPUTIN (CONT.) Bartok ... have you ever been to Paris? \nMINUTES LATER \nDmitri hands Vlad a pile of FRANCS as Anya approaches. \nANYA That was really very kind of you. \nShe gives him a kiss on the cheek and walks away with Meetoo, who turns back and gives Dmitri a look. A little guilty, Dmitri turns to Vlad. \nVLADIMIR I won't say a word... \nEXT.\tGRAND OPEN CAR - DAY \nTraveling is style! Vladimir is driving - badly - with Meetoo in the front seat. Meetoo covers his eyes. Dmitri and Anya are in the open back seat, enjoying the beautiful French countryside. \nDmitri looks over at Anya. \nDMITRI Nervous? \nANYA Yes - If I can't convince Sophie, I'll never be able to see Tatiana.... \nDMITRI You'll convince her. You have the qualities of a princess you're poised and strong... and beautiful ... even if you forget a couple dates of family names - she'll know. \nAnya smiles at Dmitri, knowing that all the confidence she has is because of him. She takes his hand but looks away. \nEXT. TATIANA'S PARIS HOUSE - DAY \nThey pull up in front of the beautiful white house. Anya is nervous as Vladimir walks up to the front door ahead of Dmitri and Anya. Vladimir knocks. Sophie answers the door. \nShe moves with grace and regal poise. \nVLADIMIR May I present her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia! \nSOPHIE Oh good! We haven't seen an Anastasia in several days! \nAnya looks to Dmitri, a little confused by that last comment. Dmitri makes a little \"she's slightly crazy\" signal. \nThey all leap to avoid her butt as she bustles into the house. \nINT. DRAWING ROOM - DAY \nSophie, flanked by her sisters, sits at a table. Anya, looking nervous but poised, sits across while Dmitri and Vladimir hover nervously at the far end of the room. \nSophie's PAT CAT, TILLIE, attempts to cuddle up next to Meetoo, who wants nothing to do with her. \nSOPHIE I'd just like to ask you a few questions, dear... \nSophie opens a huge book that SLAMS open. Vlad and Dmitri jump. \nANYA Of course. \nSOPHIE Where were you born? \n", "test1_input": "ANASTASIA \nFADE IN: \non a well-worn PHOTOGRAPH ALBUM. An ELDERLY WOMAN'S HAND touched the album, caressing it lovingly for a moment, as WE HEAR her voice. \nTATIANA (O.C.)

PETERSBERG on a brilliant summer day. \nTATIANA (CONT) A world of Tsars and Princesses and elegant palaces. . . \nCAMERA MOVES CLOSER TO the picture. . . \nTATIANA (CONT) and grand parties. . . \nThe PHOTO dissolves into REALITY in brilliant color as the day turns into night and the summer cools into winter. We see the palace at night, blanketed in a beautiful, almost glowing, snow as hourse drawn carriages pull up to the front door. \nTATIANA (CONT) A beautiful, magical time. . . \nMOVE INTO THE PALACE \nTATIANA (CONT) That would soon be gone forever. . . \nINT.  PALACE AT ST. PETERSBERG - NIGHT \nElegant ROYALISTS mingle around the MAIN HALL as an ORCHESTRA plays. \nAll eyes turn to the GLASS DOORS OF TWO ELEVADORS which descend grandly on either side of a beautiful staircase. Through the glass doors we see TATIANA, the Dowager Empress, 60, imperious and bedecked with jewels, she is seemingly unapproachable. TSAR NICHOLAS and his SON are with her. In the other elevador, ALEXANDRA and her daughters - well,  all her daughters except. . . \nANASTASIA, eight years old and apparently late for the party, rushes down the upstairs hallway followed by a SERVENT (SONYA) 16,  who is trying to catch up with Anastasia to tie a large ribbon in her long, dark hair. \nSONYA (whispering) Princess Anastasia - you're late and it's all my  fault! \nANASTASIA Don't worry, Sonya, no one'll notice. . . \nJust then, Sonya lassoes the ribbon around her hair, stopping Anastasia with a \nANASTASIA (loudly) . . .  owwwwwwwww! \nAll eyes turn to Anastasia, who once she realizes that she's the center of attention, flashes a mischievous smile and descends the staircase in grand style. As the ribbon falls out of her hair and down her back, Anastasia kicks it to Sonya without breaking stride. \nTatiana sees her and can't help but smile. \nThe music suddenly becomes  a FLOURISH OF TRUMPETS. SERVENTS open the elevador doors as the ROYAL FAMILY steps out and begins a proccession through their subjects. Tatiana holds out her arm to Anastasia as she makes it to Tatiana's side just in time. Anastasia has a beautiful but slightly impish face, dominated by large, blue, mischievous eyes. She an abundance of energy and confidence for a girl her age. \n\"THE RULARS OF RUSSIA\"  (OPENING NUMBER) \nThe elegant guests sing their admiration as the beautiful and happy Romanov family makes it's entrance into the ball, they're \"the  pride of all Russia\". Vladimir invites Sophie to dance and the entire glittering assembly assembly swings into a GLORIOUS SWEEPING WALTZ. Singing their certainty that the Romanovs will rule forever. \nDuring the above, the ball is in full swing. Beautiful COUPLES swirls across the dance floor, including Anastasia dancing gracefully with her father. \n", "test1_true": "Suddenly, A HAND grabs Dmitri and pulls him out from under the table. It's IVAR, the HEAD SERVENT, who pulls Dmitri into an open wall panel. \nIVAR (angrily) You're a servent! Never forget your place! \nDMITIRI (defiant) Someday my place will be out there! \nIVAR Never! You're a peasant, Dmitri! Back in the kitchen \nRULARS OF RUSSIA (CONT.) \nUNDERSCORE CONTINUES as Dmitri is dragged from his hiding place under the table and back to the kitchen. It's like the Moscow circus back there, COMIC MUSICAL CONFUSION. The servants sing about their demanding employers and mockingly imitate their behavior:  they imply that they have their own \"party\",  that change is coming. \nWhile back in the ballroom, the Royalists are oblivious to the servants discontent and sing their satisfaction with their own lives. \nDRAMATIC UNDERSCORE CONTINUES though the following scenes. \nON TATIANA \nin a large throne-like chair. Tatiana is very serious and very regal. She slides over to make room for Anastasia who sits next to her. \nTATIANA Why were you so late tonight \nANASTASIA I was showing Sonya something . . . \nTATIANA What were you showing her? \nANASTASIA (sheepishly) How to read. \nTATIANA I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore. \nANASTASIA I know, but I had to because . . . \nAnastasia looks up at Tatiana and sees her smile with pride.  Anastasia knows she doesn't have to explain. \nANASTASIA (cuddling) Oh, Grandmama, why do you have to go back to Paris? \nTATIANA It's where I've made my home but I do have something for you . . . \nTatiana reaches from behind the chair and brings out a beautiful MUSIC BOX.  Tatiana takes the key, a small silver and enamel flower, on a silver neck chain and winds it up. MUSIC BEGINS, she hands Anastasia the key. \nCLOSE UP \nthe key bearing the inscription \"Together in Paris\". \nANASTASIA \"Together in Paris\"! Oh, when can we be \"together in Paris?! \nTATIANA When you're older . . . \nAnastasia makes a disgruntled face.

Anya takes the scrub brush and SHOVES it across the floor, right under Phlegmenkof's unsuspecting foot.  Phlegmenkof's feet fly out from under her and she SMASHES to the floor.

There'll be no supper for any of you!  Back to work! \nAnya, behind Phlegmenkof, mimics her outraged face and angry gestures perfectly - as the CHILDREN laugh harder. \nPhlegmenkof spins and almost catches Anya.  She advances on Anya as Gregor hides behind her legs. \nANYA Don't touch him. \nPHLEGMENKOF (to Anya) You ragged, skinny, little nothing!  I have had just about enough of you . . . \nPhlegmenkof raises her hand to slap Anya, who hold her ground.  Suddenly, Phlegmenkof SNIFFS the air. \nON THE KIDS \nas the horrible smell reaches them too.  They all make faces and hold their noses. \nON PHLEGMENKOF \nwho first sniffs under her raised arm, then realized the cause of the stench . . . \nPHLEGMENKOF (CONT.) Comrade Serebreakov! \nShe tries to straighten herself out nervously - this must be someone very important. \nCOMRADE SEREBREAKOV stands in the doorway, lecherously eyeing the girls.  He is a huge, fleshly man with facial features which are reminiscent of a fish. \nPHLEGMENKOF  (CONT.) (flirting) Comrade Serebreakov!  What a lovely surprise! What brings you here? \nSEREBREAKOV I need. . . a worker. \nHis eye catches Anya. He looks her up and down, his beady eyes showing a touch of lust for her. \nSEREBREAKOV (CONT.)

Anya does one more imitation of her, making the CHILDREN laugh. But as Anya turns away from her audience, we see her facade fade and realize her terror of the future. \nINT.  ORPHANAGE - NIGHT \nThe CHILDREN huddle in their cots under tattered, thin blankets. Anya is fully dressed, illuminated by the \nlight of a FULL MOON, she ties a dull gray sheets together and anchors the \"rope\" to an ice cold radiator and throws the other end out of the window.  She is about to climb out when she looks at the sleeping children and smiles sadly. She walks over to Gregor's bed and puts one hand lovingly on his head and then reaches over and takes the hand of a sleeping LITTLE GIRL, who opens her eyes and smiles. \nGREGOR (loudly) Anya? \nThe other childern wake up as Anya gently \"shushes\" him. \nGREGOR (CONT.)

So, I'm cruisin' the rafters and... what can I say, I struck out. I thought chicks would like the fact that I can talk, you know but, I mean, the way things are going I couldn't get invited to a plague.

He moves toward the CABINET, knocking over furniture. Rasputin flings open the cabinet and we see the RELIQUARY, glowing gently as if it were sleeping. Bartok covers his eyes in fear. Even Rasputin seem a bit nervous in front of it. \nRASPUTIN (with reverence) Source of my power. Owner of my soul. I need your help. \nRasputin takes the RELIQUARY out of the cabinet and sets it on the table. \nBARTOK Hey, she's just a kid.

But now, hurry to the theatre -- I want full rehearsal -- properties -- full ballet and some musicians. Hurry -- Quickly. I will be there -- \nDuring this scene Grusinskaya has not looked at him, she is busy in the glass. Nice photography on hair and face. \nSide scene between Suzette and Pimenov, as Suzette shows him the cigarette case on the table. \nAs he goes through the door Grusinskaya crosses and almost sweeps Suzette to the door with him. \nPIMENOV Gru -- you are positively radiant. \nGRUSINSKAYA Yes, Pimenov.

Baron von Gaigern -- yes... \nWhile she waits, she moves with a sense of dance. \nGRUSINSKAYA (again into telephone) Will you get me Baron von Gaigern, please...

HOTEL - SIGN \nMusic effect over sign \"Grand Hotel.\" Precisely the same angle as before. The sign lights. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nLOBBY - BY SENF'S DESK \nThe music comes up on the DISSOLVE into the original key shot of the lobby. \nSenf is busy. \nThe Baron's chauffeur is standing impatiently by his desk. Business ad lib of Senf. He turns to the chauffeur who is barring the way of an important looking alien. \nSENF Step back please. \nChauffeur makes no effort to move. Against the normal busy, happy traffic of the evening he is a sinister figure. He does not move but glares at Senf. \nSENF I've told you three times -- Baron von Gaigern is out. \nCHAUFFEUR Did he leave any message for me? \nSENF No, he did not -- there is no message. \nThis whole scene is played in a very low key, almost in a whisper, it is interrupted by the entrance of the Doctor. \nDOCTOR (to Senf) Any letters? \nSENF No, doctor. \nDuring this short scene the chauffeur saunters off. \nKringelein comes to the doctor. \nKRINGELEIN Oh, Doctor, such a day -- such a day! \nThey move away from the scene. \nKringelein's voice diminishes as the CAMERA MOVES following the chauffeur. \nThe chauffeur saunters unthoughtfully past the florist shop and out of the door. As we pass the florist shop we see the back of the Baron in the shot. \nCAMERA PANS chauffeur out to door. He has not seen the Baron in the florist shop. THE CAMERA PANS back to florist shop waits for the Baron who emerges carrying his usual box of orchids. CAMERA FOLLOWS BARON back to Senf's desk. Key shot. \nBARON (to Senf) Madam Grusinskaya. \nSENF (taking the flowers and handing them to clerk) For Madam Grusinskaya. \nCLERK (to page boy) Madam Grusinskaya -- at once -- \nSENF (to Baron) Your chauffeur's been waiting, Baron. \nBARON (Quickly -- shortly) All right. (he glances around apprehensively) \nKringelein is speaking to the doctor. \nThe Baron approaches them. \nKRINGELEIN Baron, we must have gone a hundred miles an hour, at least... \nBARON Yes, quite. \nKRINGELEIN (to doctor) We've been together all day... and in an aeroplane. \n", "test1_true": "KRINGELEIN Yes, thanks to the Baron. The best shops, the very best. Look, Doctor, silk -- feels so nice on the skin... a London hat, see -- made in England, that's silk, too -- fifty marks... Look, the price is on it. That was half my salary before. The Baron is a very fine gentleman -- no one in my life has been so nice to me as the Baron. \nThe Baron smiles. He slaps his gauntlets on his dusty coat. \nBARON I'm going to change and we'll meet for a drink in the Yellow Room. \nKRINGELEIN In the Yellow Room, where the music's playing and the ladies are? \nBARON (amused) Where the music's playing and the ladies are... \nThe Baron leaves. \nDOCTOR No pain, Mr. Kringelein? \nKRINGELEIN Pain? Oh, no, Doctor. I think if I had pain I'd be too happy to notice it... \nNOTE: Find cut here. \nWhile Kringelein is talking, they move away from the CAMERA. \nCUT TO: \nFLASH OF BARON'S ROOM \nThe Baron enters, throws his gloves down on the bed, turns up the light, picks up a piece of paper that's been pushed under the door, glances at it. \nFLASH INSERT OF THE PAPER \nIn scrawl: \"I HAVE BEEN WAITING ALL DAY. WILL BE OUTSIDE OR AT THE GARAGE.\" \"S\" \nCUT BACK TO: \nBARON \nWe again see the apprehension on the Baron's face. He crosses, closes the window. As he does so we hear the noise from the conference room. \nBring up noise from the conference room. \nCUT TO: \nCONFERENCE ROOM \nWe must have the feeling that these men have been arguing all day. Cognac bottles, cigar ends, selzer water, remains of some sandwiches. In other words it is a business battlefield. Preysing is drawn and tired. Zinnowitz is on his feet. Flaemmchen is fast asleep in her chair, making a pretty picture. \nZINNOWITZ ...and let me say again for the tenth time... (he is hoarse and tired) ...you people were quite ready for the merger. You declared yourselves... fully agreed on all the terms -- Why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up? \nGERSTENKORN I've admitted that at one time we had reason for desiring ther merger -- What reason have we now? The Preysing Company has fallon upon evil days, very evil days. \nPreysing jumps to his feet. \nPREYSING Evil days -- I've shown you here -- (he bangs the paper) -- my company exports to the Balkans alone, sixty-five thousand marks worth of mop rags a year. \nGERSTENKORN Mop rags -- mop rags -- we're interested in something quite different! \nPREYSING What? \nSCHWEIMANN (to Gerstenkorn -- with a sigh) Shall I tell them again? \nGERSTENKORN (glancing at his watch) Why waste time -- it's getting late. \nSCHWEIMANN You see -- what we are interested in -- \nGERSTENKORN (interrupting) Ah, come on -- we're going home. \nDue to the long tedious session the men's collars are wilted. \nZINNOWITZ (rising) Mr. Preysing has too scrupulous a regard for certainties... \nGERSTENKORN You've talked enough today, you're hoarse now. \nIMPORTANT CLOSEUP OF PREYSING \nHis hand goes to his pocket. Slowly he takes out the telegram and glances at it. The following scene is played over this closeup. \nGERSTENKORN Sorry, Preysing. (he gets his hat) \nPREYSING (nervously) You've decided against the merger? \nGERSTENKORN Yes -- \nPREYSING Then, it's all over? \nGERSTENKORN Yes -- \nWAITZ (to Zinnowitz) Well -- well -- You could call my office. \nThere is a general movement to go. \nFLASH OF TELEGRAM \nTrembling in Preysing's hand. \"DEAL WITH MANCHESTER DEFINITELY OFF.\" \nGENERAL SHOT OF ROOM \nGerstenkorn crosses to Preysing. \nGERSTENKORN Goodbye, Preysing, I hope you pull through. This is a very bad time to be in such a crisis. We've... \nPREYSING (interrupting) Why talk -- it's over -- it's over -- it's finished. You've broken off negotiations. You did it. You're calling them off. You had nothing on your mind all day, but Manchester, -- Manchester -- Manchester. (he develops almost a passion) You don't suppose for one moment that I'm such a fool as not to have something that I could say definitely about Manchester. (he is generating almost a passion) \n", "test1_id": 408, "test2_input": "The Baron steps between the two looking straight into Preysing's face. \nDOCTOR Come, Mr. Kringelein. (he pulls him out of the scene towards the bar) \nPREYSING (his fists clenched, between his teeth) The man's insane -- he acts as if he is glad he is going to die...

He leaves the chauffeur and crosses to Senf. \nHOUSE DETECTIVE Better let him stay -- I've sent for the Baron... How's your wife coming along? \nSENF I was at the hospital all night walking up and down the corridor. They wouldn't let me in to see her. She has the pains, but the child doesn't come and I have to stay here chained to this desk. \nHOUSE DETECTIVE It will be all right. \nSENF I hope so. \nAt that moment Preysing enters. \nPREYSING Did you send that page? \nSENF The young lady's there, sir. \nPreysing glances off to see Flaemmchen standing looking around. \nPreysing crosses to Flaemmchen. \nFLAEMMCHEN Oh, yes, Mr. Preysing? \nPREYSING Sit here. (calls to a boy) Cognac -- for you? \nFLAEMMCHEN Nothing. \nAt that moment the Baron and Kringelein pass. \nPreysing glances up at Kringelein as he passes. \nPREYSING I'm going to keep an eye on that Kringelein fellow. I'll find out where he gets the money to hang around the Grand Hotel. \nFLAEMMCHEN Well -- you want me? \nPREYSING (looks straight at her) Yes. \nFLAEMMCHEN Well? \nPREYSING I must go to England -- at once. \nFLAEMMCHEN Well? \nPREYSING You see, I'd like to take a secretary with me for my correspondence and -- humm -- humm -- for company on the trip -- I'm nervous -- I need somebody -- I don't know if you quite understand me. You said you have travelled with gentlemen -- and I mean -- \nFLAEMMCHEN I understand perfectly. \nPREYSING What do you think your salary would be -- for such a trip? \nFLAEMMCHEN Wait -- I must figure it up. (she smokes and thinks) First, I'll need -- clothes -- shoes -- it's cold in England in March, I'll need a suit... You'd want me to look nice? \nPREYSING Of course -- of course. (he is fidgeting) \nFLAEMMCHEN A thousand marks -- (she waits anxiously thinking it might be too much) \nPREYSING It's agreed -- I will get a room here for you. \nShe is looking away. \nPREYSING I can get a room here in the Grand Hotel for you. \nShe still looks away. \nPREYSING Can you pay some attention to me? \nFLAEMMCHEN Oh, yes. \nPREYSING (looking off) Insolent young cub! \nFLAEMMCHEN You mean Baron von Gaigern? \nPREYSING Baron! \nFLAEMMCHEN Well, he's a gentleman! \nTHE BARON \nWho is leaning against a chair by a pillar with Kringelein. \nTHE CAMERA APPROACHES THEM. \nThey are not speaking.

The thought is in his mind of offering the Baron money. Charming scene. \nCUT TO: \nBARON AND CHAUFFEUR \nMoving into position. They are talking. \nBARON (quietly) I've quit. \nCHAUFFEUR You can't. \nBARON I'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you. \nCHAUFFEUR What about the money? \nBARON I'll pay you back. \nCHAUFFEUR How? \nBARON I have an idea working in my head... (he glances at Kringelein) \nCHAUFFEUR You might find a bullet through that head... \nBARON If you did that, you'd get nothing except the police after you.

(Chauffeur exits with bad grace.) \nBaron looks off... \nFULL SHOT -- FROM HIS ANGLE \nLike a pageant Grusinskaya sweeps forward -- pretty shot. Music comes up. \nGrusinskaya is followed by Suzette, Pimenov and Meierheim. People turn to look at her. She sweeps forward. \nAs she gets to the door she faces the Baron. She steps quickly aside to him. Pimenov and Meierheim pause. \nGRUSINSKAYA (to them) Go on please -- go on, Suzette. \nShe and the Baron are alone. \nBARON (quietly) Bless you... \nGRUSINSKAYA Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- I shall dance tonight -- How I shall dance -- I want to feel that you are in the theatre. \nBARON I can't. \nGRUSINSKAYA No? \nBARON No! I can't explain now. Oh, look -- the pearls.

Morning light over her hair, she is dressed. \nKRINGELEIN What's the matter? \nFLAEMMCHEN Oh -- I was thinking -- Poor Baron -- Lying there, his eyes so open. \nKRINGELEIN You loved the Baron, didn't you? \nFLAEMMCHEN Yes -- \nKRINGELEIN So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was. \nFLAEMMCHEN Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that. \nKRINGELEIN He was in desperate straits. He'd been trying to raise money all day. He laughed -- Poor devil! And then a man like Preysing kills him. \nFLAEMMCHEN (naively) I didn't like Preysing right off. \nKRINGELEIN Then why did you have anything to do with him? \nFLAEMMCHEN (simply) Money! \nKRINGELEIN Yes, of course, -- money! \nFLAEMMCHEN You don't understand that do you? \nKRINGELEIN Of course I do -- I never knew what money really meant till I started spending it.

Will -- will you let me? \nFLAEMMCHEN What? \nKRINGELEIN You'll have a good time with me. Want to? I've got enough money. Ten thousand two hundred in my pocketbook.

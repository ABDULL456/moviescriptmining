{"train": "GRAND HOTEL \nWritten by \nBela Balazs \nBased on the play \"Menschen im Hotel\" \nBy Vicki Baum \nAmerican version \nBy William A. Drake \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nPROLOGUE \nBerlin. \nSeason is March. \nAction of the picture takes place in approximately 36 hours. \nPicture commences at approximately 12:35 in the day. \nTime: The Present. \nEXTERIOR REVOLVING DOOR \nShow general natural action of people going in and people coming out but in it is the definite inference of people arriving and people leaving the big hotel. \nMOVE INSIDE THROUGH THE REVOLVING DOOR -- very quickly. CAMERA PAUSES ON THE THRESHOLD like a human being, seeing and hearing. \nDISSOLVE OUT. \nDISSOLVE INTO: Clock. It is twenty minutes to one -- and then moves slowly into the crowd of busy mid-day business jumble. \nCAMERA pushes through crowd and passes by the foot of the steps that lead up to the restaurant. In its journey, it passes Kringelein looking up. He is not pointed. \nTHE CAMERA then saunters -- getting a slow profile movement across -- near Senf's desk. Senf is very busy. THE CAMERA now passes -- profile -- the desk of Senf. General action. Senf stands before his background of slots and keys. WE PROCEED until we are facing the elevator. \nAt that moment the elevator is opening. Among the people who emerge is Suzette, who moves too quickly for us to distinguish who she is. \nTHE CAMERA PANS quickly with her and in the distance we hear her saying to Senf: \nSUZETTE Madam Grusinskaya will not want her car. \nThis line is only just above the general clatter of action but it is picked-up sharply first by Senf then by Bell-Captain -- and as the CAMERA SLOWLY TURNS AROUND, we see the boy going towards the door and we hear the voice in the distance, saying: \nVOICE Cancel Madam Grusinskaya's car. \nThe CAMERA now backs away from the scene into the BAR. (a section.) It backs to the back of the bar and proceeds -- in profile -- behind the backs of the barmen. A mixed crowd of people drinking before their lunch. \nWe pick up the Doctor, leaning his head upon his hands, looking into space. The woman next to him, a noisy blonde, is laughing. The doctor glances up at her -- she glances at the doctor. She and the audience see the scarred side of his face -- the laugh dies on her lips and she turns suddenly to her companion, who is the Baron. We do not get much of a chance to see him because at that instant he is glancing at his watch, his shoulders are turning away from THE CAMERA and he moves out towards the lobby. \nBACK UP a few feet and LAP DISSOLVE as you move into the main aisle of busy room in restaurant. Great activity of waiters. The bustle and activity of fashionable lunchtime. A string orchestra is playing. \nAmong other things, we pick up the smiling face of the pompous Maitre d'hotel, he has apparently just shown someone important to a table. \nTHE CAMERA watches his face and follows him. His face just as CAMERA reaches service table. The pompous Maitre d'hotel now becomes a thing of drama as he demands of a waiter: \nMAITRE D'HOTEL Where is that gentleman's soup? \nThe waiter, frightened and perspiring, doesn't bother to argue -- he tears off quickly (CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM) to another service table. The waiter seizes buss-boy's arm: \nWAITER Where's that soup? \nBoy goes off at great rate of speed, CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM, into service room of kitchen. Boy stops at soup chef's counter. He is not the only waiter wanting soup at that moment. He pushes his way to the front and puts his ticket forward. \nBOY Quick -- come on -- come on... \nThe soup chef, used to impatient waiters, makes no exception of the young man. He looks at him as much as to say: \"I'll slap you on the mouth.\" At the same time he is pulling over a cauldron of soup. \nCUT TO: \nCAULDRON OF SOUP being pulled over -- it dislodges a small cauldron that is near the edge. We see the soup fall and hear the scream of a woman before showing her agonized face -- She has been scalded. General steamy confusion. The chef has filled the plate. WE PROCEED the buss-boy out. Half way down the aisle, the waiter takes it from him. \nTHE CAMERA follows the waiter who places the soup before Mr. Preysing. Preysing has been waiting, with his serviette carefully tucked in his collar. His spoon is in his hand. A horrible man, ready for action. The soup is in front of him, he tastes it, pushes it away, frowns, we feel he is going to tear the place down. \nWAITER (anxious voice) Yes. \nPREYSING (grimly) Cold. \nVOICE (near Preysing's elbow) Mr. Preysing... \nPREYSING (in same voice) Yes... \nBELLBOY Telephone -- from Fredersdorf -- \nPreysing rises, struts from restaurant. CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM -- He walks out through the door... \nDISSOLVE OUT AND INTO: \nBetween two operators heads. Odd effect at board. CAMERA TILTS UP as Preysing's head looks right down at girl. \nBellboy is with Preysing. \nBELLBOY Mr. Preysing from Fredersdorf -- his call. \nAs the CAMERA IS BACKING OUT OF THE ROOM which is in reality the restaurant converted -- the tall figure of the Baron -- he proceeds through the door of the restaurant -- \nNote: Question here as to whether Yellow Room will be the restaurant converted, or not. In which case it will be necessary to add scene of Baron walking through corridor upstairs -- giving sense of distance. \nThe Baron is whistling the tune of the orchestra, he proceeds through the lobby as if on a mission. He glances at a pretty woman who passes and nods good evening to the Doctor, who is seated in his chair, not far from the desk. He enters. \nCUT TO: \nFLORIST SHOP \nPretty girl is there, she has seen him coming. She turns from the door and hands him a box of orchids, already tied in ribbon. \nBARON Good little girl -- nice ones? \nGIRL Yes, Baron. \nThe Baron would stay and flirt but he has a mission; he leaves. \nCUT TO: \nLOBBY \nIn the lobby we pick up the Baron leaving the florists with small box of flowers -- he crosses quickly to Senf's desk. \nSHOT OVER SENF'S HEAD as the Baron puts the flowers down. Senf is busy. \nThe Baron is whistling gaily -- tapping his fingers on the flower box -- he is good-natured and patient. \nSENF (to Clerk -- as telephone bell rings) Is that for me? \nCLERK No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought. (he replaces the receiver) \nSENF (to one of the bellboys) Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought. \nBoy leaves. We hear his voice out of scene at the door. \nBELLBOY'S VOICE Madam Grusinskaya's car... to be brought. \nSENF Good evening, Baron. \nBARON (amiably) Good evening. Will you send these up to Madam Grusinskaya? \nSENF Yes, Baron. (he hands the box of flowers to the clerk) Madam Grusinskaya. \nClerk hands box to bellboy. \nCLERK Room one-seventy -- Madam Grusinskaya. \nBARON (to Senf) Have you my tickets for the theatre? \nSENF Oh yes, Baron -- (to Clerk) Baron von Gaigern's seats for Madam Grusinskaya. \nTelephone rings again. Clerk picks it up. \nSENF (to Clerk) For me? \nCLERK (at telephone -- shakes his head) No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought. \nSENF (to boy) Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought. \nThe Clerk hands Senf the tickets which Senf hands to the Baron. \nBARON Charge them... \nAs the Baron is picking up his tickets he looks around quickly as he hears the voice of Pimenov, who has arrived apparently from his afternoon walk from the rehearsal at the theatre. \nPIMENOV (to Senf) Good evening -- my key -- one sixty- eight. \nBARON Good evening, Mr. Pimenov. \nPIMENOV Oh -- good evening, Baron. \nBARON How's the beautiful lady? \nPIMENOV Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the truth, Baron -- tonight we are a little bit nervous. Were you at the theatre last night? \nBARON Certainly -- always when Grusinskaya dances. \nPIMENOV Well -- last night was not so good. \nBARON I thought she was splendid! \nPIMENOV Yes -- but the audience. \nAt that moment they are interrupted by a vehement little Japanese with his wife. They are arguing with the Clerk. The Japanese speaks in Japanese to his wife. \nCLERK (to Japanese) The parquot loges are behind the parquet chairs. \nJAPANESE Then they've put me back and I want to be up in front. How is that, chairs in front of loges? \nSenf is speaking to a lady at the same time. \nSENF The train leaves at seven-thirty, Madam. That is the only through train -- the dining car goes along. \nThe Baron and Pimenov exchange glances as the little Japanese speaks volubly to his wife. \nBARON (sarcastically) It's always so quiet here. \nPIMENOV If you occupied the room next to Madam Grusinskaya, you would appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby. \nFLAEMMCHEN You're a fool! \nBARON Yes, I am rather. \nHe glances down the passage again, his hands in his pockets. \nShe glances impatiently at her watch. \nBARON He must be very nice. \nFLAEMMCHEN Who? \nBARON (gallantly) Whoever is keeping you waiting. \nFLAEMMCHEN (indicating Preysing's door) Have you seen it? \nBARON Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That? (indicating Preysing's door) \nFLAEMMCHEN That. \nBARON (with meaning) You? \nFLAEMMCHEN (quickly) Oh -- work!! \nBARON (with meaning) Oh! \nFLAEMMCHEN Dictation. (she twittles her fingers) You know... \nBARON Oh... poor child. If you were free, I'd ask you to come and have some tea -- but -- \nFLAEMMCHEN Tea would spoil my dinner. (lightly) One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil it. \nBARON Reducing? \nFLAEMMCHEN (she turns invitingly) No -- why? -- should I? \nBARON Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day? \nFLAEMMCHEN (laughing in his face) Money -- Ever heard of it? \nBARON Yes -- yes indeed -- but you are a... (moves fingers) ...a stenographer. Don't little stenographers earn little pennies? \nFLAEMMCHEN Very little. \nBARON Too bad. \nFLAEMMCHEN Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? -- One that she'd bought herself? \nBARON Poor child -- (enthusiastically) I wish I were free tonight -- we could -- \nFLAEMMCHEN (with invitation) Aren't you? \nBARON (quickly) What? \nFLAEMMCHEN Free -- \nBARON (glancing up passage) Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow though. \nFLAEMMCHEN Tomorrow? What time tomorrow? \nBARON Shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs? \nFLAEMMCHEN Where downstairs? \nBARON Yellow Room where they dance -- (business) \nFLAEMMCHEN You're very funny -- \nBARON (with great meaning) Yes? -- Tomorrow? \nFLAEMMCHEN Of course. \nBARON Really? \nFlaemmchen laughs at him. \nBARON We'll dance. \nFLAEMMCHEN (slowly) All right. We'll dance. \nAt that moment we hear Kringelein's voice calling from his doorway at the end of the passage. \nKRINGELEIN'S VOICE Baron -- Oh, Baron! \nThe Baron turns and looks off at --- \nKRINGELEIN \nKringelein is in his door in the distance -- radiant. He waves. \nKRINGELEIN If I could trouble the Baron to come and see this beautiful room. I have ordered champagne. Perhaps the Baroness could join us. \nCUT BACK TO: \nFLAEMMCHEN, BARON AND KRINGELEIN \nKRINGELEIN Waiter, oh waiter! Wait a minute! (to Baron and Flaemmchen) We are having caviar -- it's expensive but that makes no difference -- I see the Baroness is laughing. \nFLAEMMCHEN Have caviar if you like, but it tastes like herring to me. \nPimenov (at heart a clown) makes a grand comedy bow. He will deliberately try to tease Madam out of her mood. \nShe glances at him, without smiling, crosses to the dressing- table and sits. \nPIMENOV It is time for the performance. \nGRUSINSKAYA (under her breath) The performance -- the performance -- the performance. (during this scene the orchids fall to the floor) \nIt is a hysterical out-burst. It is not a woman who is just temperamental, it is something deeper than that. She is very near a nervous breakdown. We, the audience, must feel with her a revulsion against the word performance. \nPIMENOV (tenderly -- as he touches her shoulder gently) Poor little Lisevata -- she still has her stage frights -- it will pass. \nPimenov kneels by Grusinskaya -- he is chafing her hands, he attempts to soothe her. \nNow Grusinskaya draws her hands suddenly away. \nGRUSINSKAYA It is not stage fright -- it's something more -- \nPIMENOV (tenderly) What -- what is it? Last night... \nGRUSINSKAYA Last night?... There was no applause. \nPIMENOV (quickly) There was -- there was. \nGRUSINSKAYA That theatre -- half empty -- dancing for those few -- I was frantic -- I finished -- the last beat and... (she reclines her head as the swan finishing the dance) ...I waited -- I listened -- but the applause didn't come -- nothing. A man in the box -- and just the claques behind -- it is passed, Pimenov. We are dead -- it's finished. \nThere is a sudden knocking at the door. \nPIMENOV Meierheim -- \nThe door opens suddenly. Meierheim bursts into the room. \nMEIERHEIM What is this that you have cancelled your car? Who am I that I should wait like a fool at the door? And here on a whim, you cancel your car. Have you forgotten there is a performance? Do you know the time? Or, are we all mad? Am I your manager?... Have we a contract? Have we obligations? Am I blind? (glances at his watch) ...Or is that the time? \nGRUSINSKAYA I'm cancelling the engagement. \nMEIERHEIM Oh! \nBusiness of Pimenov signaling to him. \nMEIERHEIM Oh! Madam is cancelling the engagement. Madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke. Ha, ha, ha -- hurry, come on. Tonight -- there's a line in front of the theatre since six o'clock. The house is jammed to the roof. \nGRUSINSKAYA The house is not full -- Is it really full? \nMEIERHEIM Packed to the ceiling. Hurry -- get dressed. And what an audience -- the French Ambassador -- American Millionaires -- Princess Ratzville -- er -- er -- \nGRUSINSKAYA (to Suzette) Oh -- but it can't be. \nSUZETTE Oh, come, Madam -- please come. (she holds up her frock) \nGRUSINSKAYA (changed mood) All right, Suzette -- quickly -- hurry. \nPIMENOV We will wait. \nMEIERHEIM You are late. Hurry. \nMeierheim goes over to telephone, he picks up receiver and says: \nMEIERHEIM Tell Madam Grusinskaya's chauffeur to bring the car. \nShow few feet of Grusinskaya getting dressed. \nCUT TO: \nBY ELEVATOR \nPimenov and Meierheim. \nMeierheim is pushing the bell. \nPIMENOV How is the house? \nMEIERHEIM Terrible. After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz -- (snaps his fingers) Just jazz. \nPIMENOV If the house is empty again, I don't know -- \nMEIERHEIM When she gets her paint on and hears the music -- she'll be all right. I know these people. \nThey are walking towards Kringelein's room. They are pacing rather like men who walk the deck on a liner. They turn almost together, but when they turn back past the CAMERA the CAMERA PROCEEDS on into Kringelein's room. The CAMERA ENTERS THE ROOM to a burst of laughter. Champagne bottles open, caviar, smoke, etc. \nIn the room are the Doctor, Kringelein, the Baron, Flaemmchen, and a very fat waiter -- comedian. \nKRINGELEIN You may laugh. Caviar and champagne may mean nothing to you, but to me -- they mean a great deal. You see, I'm ill and all of a sudden I got a fear of missing life. I don't want to miss life -- do you understand? \nFLAEMMCHEN You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch. \nKRINGELEIN Yes -- and for me, it's going to leave at any minute. Let's drink. \nThe Baron offers Flaemmchen a glass of champagne. She shakes her head. \nKRINGELEIN I'm sure this beautiful room must appeal to your taste -- distinctive, don't you think? Velvet upholstery -- 'A-number one'. I'm in the textile trade and I know. (he has a slight case of hiccups from the champagne. He touches the drapes) And these are real silk drapes. \nFLAEMMCHEN (amusedly) Silk -- think of that -- silk -- they are, too. \nKRINGELEIN (who hasn't stopped talking) Have you seen the bathroom? -- Hot and cold running water -- You see, I can get a bath whenever I like. \nAt that moment Preysing's voice is heard calling to the Floor Clerk. \nPREYSING The stenographer! \nMusic swells up from the Yellow Room. A great deal of noise, confusion and activity as the elevator stops to emit Grusinskaya, followed by Pimenov, Meierheim and some other people who are rather excited to be in the elevator with the great Grusinskaya. \nMEIERHEIM (off scene) The car for Madam Grusinskaya. \nThe bellboy hears it and passes the word around. It seems to be echoed through the lobby. \nPeople turn, as Grusinskaya's spirit seems to rise with the attention she is getting. \nTHE CAMERA precedes her through the revolving door, as she sweeps outside of the hotel. \nThe Baron's chauffeur, Schweinke, is seen to watch her go. He looks furtively around and enters the hotel. \nCUT BACK TO: \nUPPER CORRIDOR - CLOSEUP OF BARON \nAs he watches Suzette returning from Grusinskaya's room. She is about to push lift button - then decides to run downstairs. \nIMPORTANT CLOSEUP OF BARON \nFADE OUT: \nEND OF SEQUENCE \"#1\" \nPREYSING'S ROOM \nZinnowitz and Preysing are standing by door. \nPREYSING No news from Manchester yet -- Do you think we ought to postpone the conference? \nZINNOWITZ Good heavens no. That'd create the very worst impression. You must be optimistic. You must convince them. You know as well as I do that the merger must go through. \nPREYSING Yes -- the merger must go through -- But I am used to making my deals on a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am an honest business man -- a good husband and father -- I have a sense of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. I couldn't live happily otherwise. \nZINNOWITZ Well, don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through. \nPREYSING I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like to have things down before me in black and white. \nZINNOWITZ I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight. \nPREYSING Good night. \nZinnowitz leaves. \nSEQUENCE \"#2\" \nFADE IN ON BLACKNESS OF PREYSING'S ROOM \nWe hear the distant voice of Preysing and the keys of the typewriter rattling. The reason for the blackness is that Preysing's back is flat into the camera. His hands are behind his back and his fat fingers are moving restlessly. It is an odd effect. We don't know quite what it is. \nPREYSING'S VOICE Both parties have fully agreed that this merger can result only in mutual advantages. \nPreysing moves forward showing that we are in Preysing's room. \nThe change of light shows us plainly the time lapse. \nFlaemmchen is seated at a small table typing. Preying strides forward As he strides he says: \nPREYSING Moreover -- \nFLAEMMCHEN (repeating) Moreover -- \nPreysing paces the room. \nPREYSING (repeating) Moreover -- (he pauses, thinking. Picks up telephone quickly -- into telephone) Is there a telegram for me yet?... Oh -- when it does, send it up. \nDuring this, Flaemmchen, who is tired sits back and rubs her fingers that have been over-worked. She glances at her wrist- watch. \nPreysing comes and stands behind Flaemmchen. \nPREYSING Now, where was I? (he looks over the sheet in her typewriter -- accidentally his arm touches her neck) Oh -- sorry. (he puts his cigar in his mouth and walks away. As he walks away) Where was I? \nAs he turns, he catches a down shot on her from behind as she stretches back showing her busts. Seeing his face looking down on her she pulls herself together and seats herself at attention. \nFLAEMMCHEN Moreover... \nPREYSING Moreover... \nIt seems a silly kind of lull. \nPREYSING Do you work in Justice Zinnowitz' office? \nFLAEMMCHEN No -- only occasional jobs. (she yawns suddenly) \nPREYSING Tired? \nFLAEMMCHEN You pay me. \nPREYSING You're a very unusual stenographer -- \nFLAEMMCHEN Moreover... \nPREYSING Moreover... (as he paces the room, it is obvious that he is trying to collect his thoughts) \nShe looks at him, waits a moment and then begins characteristically to, change the sheet of paper. \nFLAEMMCHEN I don't see why it's unusual for a stenographer to be pretty -- if she does her work well, -- seems so silly. I don't know why they don't like girls like me in offices. Personally, I hate offices -- I'd much rather be in the movies. \nPREYSING Movies? \nBARON And...? \nGRUSINSKAYA He disappeared. Later he was found dead. \nBARON I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone. (he embraces her) \nGRUSINSKAYA Go away. Who are you --? \nBARON A man who could love -- that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you. \nGRUSINSKAYA You could love me. It is so long since I have heard that word. Nobody has loved me for a long time. It is so icy-cold to be famous. One is so cruelly alone. How is it that you -- Let me look at you. Your hands. Your eyes. Why could you love me? \nBARON I saw you just now -- then I saw you cry -- and now I see you in the mirror -- Grusinskaya... \nGRUSINSKAYA Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand. \nBARON Yes -- I do understand. \nGRUSINSKAYA I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor. \nBARON I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here? \nGRUSINSKAYA I want to be alone. \nBARON That is not so -- you don't want to be alone. (he looks back at the bed as if remembering the suicide.) \nGRUSINSKAYA I want to be alone -- \nBARON No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me. \nGRUSINSKAYA (whispering) Just for a minute then. \nOutside the distant noise of Kringelein is heard -- \nBARON What? Say it again -- I didn't hear. \nShe whispers. \nGRUSINSKAYA You -- man... \nThe way she says it, the word goes home. It hurts him. She has looked into his eyes for a moment with a strangely melting and almost happy expression. She gets up suddenly. \n(NOTE: The other side of the bed -- not where the glass is) \nShe reaches with her feet for her slippers. She puts one on. She can't find the other. \nBusiness as he gets other slipper for her. \nHe kisses her ankle and looks up at her. She smiles down. \nGRUSINSKAYA Thank you -- you are gallant. (she turns, her mood has changed) What a sentimental scene. Grusinskaya weeping is a sight worth seeing. It is many years since she did such a thing... You frightened me -- badly. You're responsible for this -- painful scene. \nHe watches her. \nThe sound of her own voice reassures her. She is generating warmth. Her cry has done her good, she speaks quickly, volubly. \nGRUSINSKAYA The stage frays one's nerves... the discipline -- it's so exacting. Discipline means doing what you don't want to do and take no pleasure in doing. Do you know what I mean? Have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline? \nBARON I? -- Oh, no. I do only what I take pleasure in doing. \nGrusinskaya turns, she is graceful again. \nGRUSINSKAYA I see -- you do only what you take pleasure in doing. You take pleasure in coming into a woman's bedroom and you come. You take pleasure in a dangerous climb onto a balcony, so you do it... And what is your pleasure now? \nBARON (naive as he says frankly) I should like to smoke. \nShe rises. She had expected something else. His reply strikes her as chivalrous and considerate. She crosses to the writing table brings back her little cigarette box which she holds out to him. He takes a cigarette and lights it. She watches him curiously. She smiles, as she watches him greedily inhale the smoke. She crosses and sits before her looking glass. She brushes her hair back and powders her face. She looks into the mirror, we feel that she has regained a desire to live. He crosses and looks at her in the mirror, he smiles. \nGRUSINSKAYA Why do you smile? \nBARON Because I can see something in the mirror that you cannot. My dear -- (he pauses suddenly) \nGRUSINSKAYA What can you see? \nBARON You are beautiful! \nGRUSINSKAYA No. \nBARON Beautiful but so sad. I did not know it was so dangerous to look into a woman's bedroom. \nSuddenly he stoops, takes her shoulder in his hands and kisses it. A long tender and sincere embrace. \nHer eyes close. A tremor passes through her. Suddenly his whole being is aware of her. She turns, rises and disengages herself. \nGRUSINSKAYA I think you had better go now. The key is on the floor. \nHe glances back. He speaks suddenly with an air of command. \nBARON I'm not going... You know that I'm not going... Do you think I could leave you alone here? After that --? \nGRUSINSKAYA What? \nBARON The veronal -- you. I'm going to stay here with you. \nGRUSINSKAYA I want to be alone. \nBARON That is not the truth. (he catches her wrists) You do not want to be alone -- you're afraid of being alone -- I know you're afraid. I know you. You were desperate, just now, if I go away you'll be more desperate than ever. Say I am to stay with you... say it. (he almost shakes her) \nHer head falls slowly on his breast. \nEND OF SEQUENCE \"#2\" \nSEQUENCE \"#3\" \nFADE IN: \nTELEPHONE ROOM \nIt is the first time we have seen it. There are about eight girls very busy. Morning confusion. (parts to be written) \nWe pick up essential lines as we PAN DOWN SHOOTING AT THE GIRL'S FACES, assuming the CAMERA to be the board. \nGIRL ONE Grand Hotel -- good morning -- no, Baron von Gaigern's room does not answer... Yes,... all right... Baron von Gaigern's chauffeur calling. \nCAMERA PANS TO: \nGIRL THREE Good morning, nine-thirty Doctor Otternschlag... No, Doctor, no messages... No, Doctor. \nCAMERA PANS TO: \nGIRL FIVE Grand Hotel -- good morning... who is calling Madam Grusinskaya?... Oh, Mr. Pimenov. Madam Grusinskaya is not to be disturbed, sir... no, sir... yes, sir -- \nThe word passes down repeated. \nVOICE Mr. Preysing's calls to one sixty two for today. \nCAMERA PANS TO: \nGIRL EIGHT -- good morning... Mr. Preysing -- (she plugs through) \nCUT TO: \nCONFERENCE ROOM \nTelephone bell ringing. \nGeneral shot. \nGerstenkorn, an old business man and Doctor Waitz, counsel for the Saxonia organization are sitting at a gree table, smoking and waiting. \nGERSTENKORN (glances at watch) Nine-thirty, Mr. Preysing keeps us waiting. \nSCHWEIMANN (who has returned) He likes to play the great man. \nWAITZ (glancing at market report from table) The Preysing stock is holding its own today on the market. \nSCHWEIMANN Ask Preysing what it's costing him to keep it up. \nGERSTENKORN And ask me what it's costing us to hammer it down. \nWAITZ Exactly. \nGERSTENKORN If the Preysing people get the Manchester contract, we shall certainly merge with the Preysing company -- but if they haven't they're ruined -- Preysing will have to declare himself. \nWAITZ Shhh -- here he is now. \nThe door opens and Flaemmchen enters. She is agreeably surprised to see the room full of men. She likes men. \nFLAEMMCHEN (beams) Good morning, gentlemen -- Mr. Preysing will be here in a minute. \nBusiness of Schweimann and Flaemmchen. \nGerstenkorn, making notes, glances at his watch again. \nDoor opens suddenly. \nPREYSING (enters) Good morning, gentlemen. \nMEN Good morning. \nPREYSING Sorry I'm late, I've been waiting for Justice Zinnowitz, my legal advisor. \nWAITZ Oh -- ho -- you want legal aid against us? -- The whole thing seems to me to be very simple. \nGERSTENKORN Very simple -- I've always liked the way you dressed, Preysing -- English, isn't it? \nPREYSING (disturbed) What? \nGERSTENKORN (quickly) They turn out marvelous material in Manchester. \nPREYSING Manchester -- yes. Yes, yes, they do. Yes -- Now gentlemen shall we begin at the beginning? -- Have we cigars -- water and everything? \nFlaemmchen, who has been busy preparing her little table for work is seen in several CLOSEUPS: \nSCHWEIMANN (with a wink to Gerstenkorn) Manchester is a very interesting city, don't you think so, Preysing? \nPREYSING (stalling) Manchester -- yes -- yes. A man in the textile industry naturally has to know Manchester. \nGERSTENKORN There's a lot of business to be done with the Manchester Cotton Company. They've the whole English market right in their hands. Have you any connections with -- Manchester? \nPREYSING (quickly) We have a good many connections in England, naturally. \nGERSTENKORN I mean with the Manchester people? \nPREYSING (looking at Gerstenkorn impudently) We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the beginning. \nGERSTENKORN (winking at Schweimann) All right. \nPREYSING (far-away commencing to read his report) Since, on the eleventh of June, this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger between our respective firms was entered into -- both parties have fully agreed that this merger can result only in mutual advantages. \nBARON When I was a little boy I was taught to ride and be a gentleman -- at school, it was a monastery, I learned to pray and lie -- and --- \nGRUSINSKAYA And? \nBARON And then, in the war, to kill and hide. That's all. \nGRUSINSKAYA And what do you do -- now? \nBARON I'm a gambler -- I'm running at large like a happy pig, devouring anything of life that pleases me, I really belong in jail \nGRUSINSKAYA Oh! What a picture -- and what else? \nBARON (seriously) I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief. (he turns away) \nGRUSINSKAYA That's a silly joke. \nBARON (turns -- takes both her hands) Please look at me. You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you -- that I have never known what love is -- until last night. (he releases her hands and turns away again.) \nGRUSINSKAYA What is the matter? \nHe does not answer. \nGRUSINSKAYA Flix! \nThe Baron takes the pearls out of his pocket and lays them before her. \nBARON There. \nGRUSINSKAYA (with a little cry of pain) Oh -- (in the silence Grusinskaya puts her head in her hands and thinks) \nThe Baron makes a gesture as if to stroke her hair and then holds back. \nGRUSINSKAYA (softly) Did you come here just -- just for that? Oh -- it's horrible. \nPause. \nShe is suddenly cold. \nGRUSINSKAYA You may keep the pearls -- I don't want them any more -- I'll make you a present of them. \nBARON (passionately) I don't want them now. \nGRUSINSKAYA (broken) I'll not denounce you. \nBARON I know. \nGRUSINSKAYA So -- \nBARON Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, -- \nGRUSINSKAYA But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go --- \nBARON I wanted money desperately -- Can you understand? -- That's why I wanted the pearls. I was threatened -- I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money. I've been following you -- I've admired you. But I have forced myself not to think about you -- Last night, at last, I managed to came into your room and -- and now. \nGRUSINSKAYA (softly) And now? \nBARON I couldn't go through with it. (his head goes down into her lap -- he sighs:) Remarkable. \nHis hand touches her hair -- tenderly. \nBARON Do you understand? \nGRUSINSKAYA Yes -- yes -- yes. \nThere is a sudden knock at the door. \nGRUSINSKAYA Quickly -- here. \nWith a quick gesture Grusinskaya beckons the Baron to the bathroom. He disappears into the bathroom. She opens the door, after finding the key and radiantly addresses Suzette. \nGRUSINSKAYA Good morning, Suzette. \nSUZETTE (delighted to see her in a good mood) Good morning, Madam. \nShe puts the coffee down on the table. \nCharming piece of business as Suzette, in putting the coffee down on the table must necessarily push back the heavily crested cigarette case of the Baron. \nSUZETTE Madam has slept well? \nGRUSINSKAYA (enthusiastically) Oh, yes, Suzette. \nSUZETTE Madam will dress now, it is late. \nGRUSINSKAYA Five minutes, Suzette, come back in five minutes. I'll ring. \nSUZETTE Yes, madam Suzette knows all about it. \nShe is a French woman. She is pleased. \nSUZETTE Madam is beautiful this morning. \nAs Grusinskaya hurries Suzette to the door she says: \nGRUSINSKAYA Yes, Suzette. \nSuzette goes out. Quickly Grusinskaya crosses and flings open the bathroom door. The Baron comes out. \nGRUSINSKAYA You must go now. \nGRUSINSKAYA Good morning, Pimenov. \nPIMENOV (a little puzzled at change in her) Good morning, Gru -- your -- \nBefore he can start speaking of last night she quickly speaks: \nGRUSINSKAYA Pimenov, I have an idea -- a new ballet -- it must have mad music -- I'll explain it to you later. But now, hurry to the theatre -- I want full rehearsal -- properties -- full ballet and some musicians. Hurry -- Quickly. I will be there -- \nDuring this scene Grusinskaya has not looked at him, she is busy in the glass. Nice photography on hair and face. \nSide scene between Suzette and Pimenov, as Suzette shows him the cigarette case on the table. \nAs he goes through the door Grusinskaya crosses and almost sweeps Suzette to the door with him. \nPIMENOV Gru -- you are positively radiant. \nGRUSINSKAYA Yes, Pimenov. (quickly to Suzette) One minute, Suzette, I will call you. \nThey leave. \nGrusinskaya shuts the door. She sweeps happily to the telephone. \nGRUSINSKAYA (very very softly - her voice is like music to operator) Hello -- will you -- will you get me Baron von Gaigern, please... yes... Baron von Gaigern -- yes... \nWhile she waits, she moves with a sense of dance. \nGRUSINSKAYA (again into telephone) Will you get me Baron von Gaigern, please... (she speaks quietly) Cherie... yes... it is you... nothing... good morning, good morning, cherie... nothing... no... just to tell you I'm happy. \nFADE OUT SLOWLY: \nBring music up. \nEND OF SEQUENCE \"#3\" \nSEQUENCE \"#4\" \nEXT. HOTEL - SIGN \nMusic effect over sign \"Grand Hotel.\" Precisely the same angle as before. The sign lights. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nLOBBY - BY SENF'S DESK \nThe music comes up on the DISSOLVE into the original key shot of the lobby. \nSenf is busy. \nThe Baron's chauffeur is standing impatiently by his desk. Business ad lib of Senf. He turns to the chauffeur who is barring the way of an important looking alien. \nSENF Step back please. \nChauffeur makes no effort to move. Against the normal busy, happy traffic of the evening he is a sinister figure. He does not move but glares at Senf. \nSENF I've told you three times -- Baron von Gaigern is out. \nCHAUFFEUR Did he leave any message for me? \nSENF No, he did not -- there is no message. \nThis whole scene is played in a very low key, almost in a whisper, it is interrupted by the entrance of the Doctor. \nDOCTOR (to Senf) Any letters? \nSENF No, doctor. \nDuring this short scene the chauffeur saunters off. \nKringelein comes to the doctor. \nKRINGELEIN Oh, Doctor, such a day -- such a day! \nThey move away from the scene. \nKringelein's voice diminishes as the CAMERA MOVES following the chauffeur. \nThe chauffeur saunters unthoughtfully past the florist shop and out of the door. As we pass the florist shop we see the back of the Baron in the shot. \nCAMERA PANS chauffeur out to door. He has not seen the Baron in the florist shop. THE CAMERA PANS back to florist shop waits for the Baron who emerges carrying his usual box of orchids. CAMERA FOLLOWS BARON back to Senf's desk. Key shot. \nBARON (to Senf) Madam Grusinskaya. \nSENF (taking the flowers and handing them to clerk) For Madam Grusinskaya. \nCLERK (to page boy) Madam Grusinskaya -- at once -- \nSENF (to Baron) Your chauffeur's been waiting, Baron. \nBARON (Quickly -- shortly) All right. (he glances around apprehensively) \nKringelein is speaking to the doctor. \nThe Baron approaches them. \nKRINGELEIN Baron, we must have gone a hundred miles an hour, at least... \nBARON Yes, quite. \nKRINGELEIN (to doctor) We've been together all day... and in an aeroplane. \nGERSTENKORN What? \nPREYSING Oh no -- no -- the session is over. Let's go, it's off. Thank you, gentlemen. (he starts packing up his papers.) \nGERSTENKORN If you actually have news from Manchester then... \nPREYSING Gentlemen, I am now free to announce... (he is perspiring, his hands are trembling) ...that the deal between my firm and the Manchester Cotton Company has been successfully negotiated. \nGERSTENKORN Preysing, you're joking with us. \nSCHWEIMANN You're a deep one. \nQUICK CLOSEUP OF ZINNOWITZ \nGENERAL SHOT OF ROOM \nGERSTENKORN In that case give us the articles. We'll sign at once. We know all the details... \nPREYSING (smiling, slowly folds up the telegram and puts it back in his pocket) I thought we'd suspended negotiations, gentlemen. \nGERSTENKORN Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter. \nPREYSING Under these circumstances we might refuse to sign. \nBy this time, Waitz and Zinnowitz have the articles out upon the table. \nPreysing is perspiring. \nGerstenkorn puts his arms around Preysing's shoulders. \nGERSTENKORN Come on -- business is business -- Come on -- \nPreysing stands, looking ahead of him. \nGerstenkorn picks up the papers glances at them, looks at Waitz. \nFlaemmchen is awakening. \nGERSTENKORN Here's my signature -- here Preysing, sign here. \nZINNOWITZ What a session this has been. \nWhile Preysing is signing. \nSCHWEIMANN It's twenty-five to six. \nWAITZ We should celebrate this with a bottle of wine. \nGERSTENKORN (with his hat and coat) See you soon, Preysing. Next week we'll meet and discuss further details. \nPREYSING Next week. \nHasty hand-shaking, business of exits. \nWaitz, Gerstenkorn and Schweimann out. \nPreysing has not moved. \nZinnowitz takes the agreement and waves it in the air to dry the signature. \nPREYSING (to himself) Next week. \nZINNOWITZ You let me talk till I'm hoarse and you had Manchester sewed-up all the time. Why? \nPreysing does not answer. \nZinnowitz amiably shrugs his shoulders. \nZINNOWITZ Well -- the deal has been put through. \nPreysing commences to laugh suddenly with increasing violence. \nPREYSING Yes, it has been put through -- it has been put through. \nDuring this scene, Flaemmchen has risen, piled up her papers, glanced at her watch. During this action Flaemmchen motions to Zinnowitz that she is going down to dance, etc., Preysing is unaware of this action. Flaemmchen leaves the room trying not to attract attention. \nZINNOWITZ (to Preysing) What's the matter with you? \nPREYSING (hysterically) Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff. \nZINNOWITZ What's bluff? \nPREYSING (throwing the telegram on the table) That. \nZINNOWITZ (reading at out loud) 'Deal with Manchester definitely off! \"Preysing, oh -- I'd never have thought it of you. \nPREYSING No one would have thought it of me. I've been getting rusty in Fredersdorf. Well, if bluff is what the world wants I guess I can put up as big a bluff as anyone. From now on... (he turns away) \nZINNOWITZ You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through. \nPREYSING Yes -- I must go to England -- I was desperate -- Now I don't care -- This sort of thing goes to a man's head. \nZINNOWITZ What you need is some relaxation. \nPREYSING Yes -- that's what I want -- I'd like to tear loose -- I'd like a drink. I'd like to go down to that dancing place. I'd like to start something. \nZINNOWITZ I can understand that -- after your -- uh -- \nPREYSING Say it -- say it -- my lie -- it's the first time in thirty years that I've ever... Where's that stenographer? Miss Flaemm... \nFLAEMMCHEN What have you been doing all day? \nBARON Chasing around. \nFLAEMMCHEN Chasing what? \nBARON Money. \nThey dance a few steps, in silence. \nFLAEMMCHEN You were very different yesterday. \nBARON Yesterday -- yes -- that was yesterday. \nThey dance into the crowd. \nCUT BACK TO: \nBAR \nDOCTOR Well, Mr. Kringelein, are you getting what you're looking for? \nKRINGELEIN What, Doctor? \nDOCTOR A masculine paradise -- drink, the ladies, dancing... \nKRINGELEIN I had a very good opportunity, a young lady asked me to dance -- I ought to be able to dance, it seems to be very important. \nDOCTOR You must learn as quickly as your time allows -- Believe me Mr. Kringelein, a man who isn't with a woman is a dead man. \nKRINGELEIN Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you all alone in the world. \nDOCTOR (quietly) I'm always alone -- I have been everything. \nKRINGELEIN Everything? \nDOCTOR I was sent as a military surgeon to South Africa. Stinking climate. Taken prisoner. Home on parole not to fight. I was a surgeon in the Great War till the end. Grenade in the face. Carried diphtheria bacilli in the wound until 1920. Isolated two years. (pause) I've been everything. \nThe music has stopped. \nCUT TO: \nBARON AND FLAEMMCHEN ON DANCE FLOOR \nFLAEMMCHEN That was lovely. \nBARON Will you do me a big favor? \nFLAEMMCHEN I'll do anything for you. \nBARON Would you like to make a man happy? \nFLAEMMCHEN (quietly) Yes -- I'd love to. \nBARON Then dance the next number with Kringelein. \nFLAEMMCHEN Why? \nBARON I feel sorry for him. \nFLAEMMCHEN You're not a bit like you were yesterday. \nBARON I fell in love last night -- the real thing. \nFLAEMMCHEN Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist. \nBARON I thought that, too -- but I found that it does. Come along, dance with Kringelein. \nFLAEMMCHEN Anything for you. \nThey move off. As they approach the bar, happily Preysing pushes into scene, touches Flaemmchen's arm. \nPREYSING Miss Flaemm. \nFLAEMMCHEN Hello! \nPREYSING I must speak with you, Miss Flaemm. \nFLAEMMCHEN (with the Baron) Presently, Mr. Preysing. \nPREYSING It's urgent. \nBARON Pardon me, the lady has urgent business here with me. \nPREYSING (to himself) Insolent -- Berlin manners. \nAt that moment Kringelein has descended from the stool and crosses to Preysing. \nKRINGELEIN I wish you a very good evening, Mr. Preysing. You are staying here, too, Mr. Preysing? \nPREYSING I don't know you. \nKRINGELEIN Oh -- you must know me -- Kringelein at the plant. Assistant bookkeeper, building C, room twenty-three -- third floor. \nFLAEMMCHEN (quickly) Come and dance with me, Mr. Kringelein. \nPREYSING I must speak to you, Miss Flaemm -- business. \nFLAEMMCHEN (lightly) Tomorrow morning. \nThe Baron steps between the two looking straight into Preysing's face. \nDOCTOR Come, Mr. Kringelein. (he pulls him out of the scene towards the bar) \nPREYSING (his fists clenched, between his teeth) The man's insane -- he acts as if he is glad he is going to die... (hesitates -- to Flaemmchen) I shall see you in the lobby in half an hour. \nEND SEQUENCE \"#4\" \nSEQUENCE \"#5\" \nFADE IN: \nKEY SHOT OF LOBBY OVER SENF'S HEAD \nGeneral activity. \nThe house detective, later identified, is talking to the chauffeur. He leaves the chauffeur and crosses to Senf. \nHOUSE DETECTIVE Better let him stay -- I've sent for the Baron... How's your wife coming along? \nSENF I was at the hospital all night walking up and down the corridor. They wouldn't let me in to see her. She has the pains, but the child doesn't come and I have to stay here chained to this desk. \nHOUSE DETECTIVE It will be all right. \nSENF I hope so. \nAt that moment Preysing enters. \nPREYSING Did you send that page? \nSENF The young lady's there, sir. \nPreysing glances off to see Flaemmchen standing looking around. \nPreysing crosses to Flaemmchen. \nFLAEMMCHEN Oh, yes, Mr. Preysing? \nPREYSING Sit here. (calls to a boy) Cognac -- for you? \nFLAEMMCHEN Nothing. \nAt that moment the Baron and Kringelein pass. \nPreysing glances up at Kringelein as he passes. \nPREYSING I'm going to keep an eye on that Kringelein fellow. I'll find out where he gets the money to hang around the Grand Hotel. \nFLAEMMCHEN Well -- you want me? \nPREYSING (looks straight at her) Yes. \nFLAEMMCHEN Well? \nPREYSING I must go to England -- at once. \nFLAEMMCHEN Well? \nPREYSING You see, I'd like to take a secretary with me for my correspondence and -- humm -- humm -- for company on the trip -- I'm nervous -- I need somebody -- I don't know if you quite understand me. You said you have travelled with gentlemen -- and I mean -- \nFLAEMMCHEN I understand perfectly. \nPREYSING What do you think your salary would be -- for such a trip? \nFLAEMMCHEN Wait -- I must figure it up. (she smokes and thinks) First, I'll need -- clothes -- shoes -- it's cold in England in March, I'll need a suit... You'd want me to look nice? \nPREYSING Of course -- of course. (he is fidgeting) \nFLAEMMCHEN A thousand marks -- (she waits anxiously thinking it might be too much) \nPREYSING It's agreed -- I will get a room here for you. \nShe is looking away. \nPREYSING I can get a room here in the Grand Hotel for you. \nShe still looks away. \nPREYSING Can you pay some attention to me? \nFLAEMMCHEN Oh, yes. \nPREYSING (looking off) Insolent young cub! \nFLAEMMCHEN You mean Baron von Gaigern? \nPREYSING Baron! \nFLAEMMCHEN Well, he's a gentleman! \nTHE BARON \nWho is leaning against a chair by a pillar with Kringelein. \nTHE CAMERA APPROACHES THEM. \nThey are not speaking. The Baron is looking off at: \nFLASH A SHOT FROM HIS ANGLE OF CHAUFFEUR \nHe takes her hand, kisses it quietly. \nGRUSINSKAYA I'm worried about you. \nBARON Don't. \nGRUSINSKAYA On the train? \nBARON Yes -- I will be on the train. \nGRUSINSKAYA Till then. \nBARON Bless you -- \nDuring this scene Kringelein has been hovering nearby. As Grusinskaya turns away and exits, Kringelein approaches the Baron, who is standing perfectly still, looking off, -- his mind miles away. \nKRINGELEIN Was the Baron joking, or is it really true that the Baron is -- in financial straits. \nBARON (lightly) Absolutely true, Kringelein and I have to raise some money immediately. \nKRINGELEIN If the Baron -- if you would permit me -- \nThe Baron looks at him suddenly. \nBARON What? \nKRINGELEIN I would be awfully glad to oblige, you've been so decent to me. Three hundred? \nBARON If I could get into a game I might win some. \nKRINGELEIN Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me. \nBARON If we could scare up some men to play. \nKRINGELEIN We could come to my room. \nBARON (with enthusiasm) Good! \nAt that moment Flaemmchen passes. \nBARON Going? \nFLAEMMCHEN Yes -- \nFlaemmchen hesitates as though she wanted to say something that is on her mind. \nA curious little scene. \nShe doesn't speak, she just turns suddenly through the door. The Baron glances after her a little puzzled, turns back to Kringelein. \nBARON Ready, Kringelein? \nKRINGELEIN Ready, Baron. \nThey move off and are last in the crowd. \nFADE OUT: \nEND OF SEQUENCE \"#5\" \nSEQUENCE \"#6\" \nNo scenes 88-93 inclusive \nSequence omitted from original script. \nDISSOLVE INTO: \nKRINGELEIN'S ROOM \nPossibly ten men are gathered about a green table. They are playing cards. There are champagne bottles, glasses, etc., on the table -- a great deal of smoke. Good atmosphere. The game is [...] fer. There is a dead silence except for the monotonous words of the players. \nWhite faced, the Baron has the bank. \nOtternschlag is seen to close the door quietly and approach the table. \nKringelein's back is to us. \nThey are smart people, not professional gamblers. \nThere is a tension in the room. The men are gathered around tightly. We do not see the cards. \nThe following voices are heard: \nBARON'S VOICE All right, gentlemen. \nVOICES I play -- I play -- Here -- Up -- Playing -- \nKRINGELEIN'S VOICE Yes -- me. \nSeveral men glance at Kringelein and the size of his stake. \nKRINGELEIN Is that too much, Baron? \nBARON (glances down at his own money) No -- not at all. \nKRINGELEIN All right then. \nBARON All right then. \nBy this time the men are pausing by the door. \nKRINGELEIN I oughtn't to presume, but I -- (he is a little drunk) I'm so grateful to you -- it's been so marvelous. The first time in my life I have gambled -- I've danced! Oh, you can laugh, gentlemen, but it's the first time in my life I've ever tasted life! \nA MAN (slapping him on back) Splendid! \nThere is a general feeling in the room that although this man is drunk he is terribly sincere, and that there is no wish to embarrass themselves or him. In fact, there is a nervous impatient movement among the men. But Kringelein has reached an emotional pitch. \nKRINGELEIN Life, gentlemen, is wonderful, but very dangerous. You must have courage for it, then it's wonderful. You gentlemen don't know that because you are all healthy and happy, but I -- believe me -- a man must know death and not until then does a man know anything about life. \nA MAN (sings) Rejoice in life while yet the small lamp burns. \nGeneral noise among men, some are ribald, others are serious. Two men come and shake hands with Kringelein, bidding him goodnight. \nThe Baron puts his hand restrainingly on Kringelein's shoulder. \nKringelein almost staggers towards the sideboard. The men are nearing the door. \nA MAN (starts singing) It's a short life and a gay one... \nKRINGELEIN (seizing a glass of champagne) Every glass high to life -- the splendid, dangerous, mighty, brief -- brief life -- and the courage to live it. (turns to Baron) Baron, you know -- I've only lived since last night -- but that little while seems longer than all the time before -- all the -- (he collapses suddenly onto the floor) \nBusiness ad lib. \nThe doctor is there quickly. The Baron next. \nMAN Drunk. \nANOTHER MAN Poor fellow. \nGeneral normal business ad lib between the men. Perhaps three of them help him up, including the Baron. They carry Kringelein to the bed. \nVOICES (of players mingling) Drunk? No, he's ill. Looks ill. (well paused over:) He's a doctor -- The doctor's here -- He's just drunk! \nDOCTOR Gentlemen, this man is ill -- very ill -- if you will leave. \nVOICES Certainly, Doctor. Goodnight! Goodnight, Baron! Bad luck! \nDRUNKEN MAN He's not used to champagne -- why does he drink it? \nLittle comedy on exit. Ad lib. \nINTERCUT FOR RELIEF -- Kringelein's face -- white, drawn, tragic. \nOne man, perhaps, remains. \nMAN Can I help, doctor? \nDOCTOR No, the Baron will stay. \nBARON Certainly. \nMan leaves. During this scene the Baron has been carefully making Kringelein comfortable on the bed, bolstering pillows behind his head. Kringelein's eyes are shut tightly, his hands are limp. \nBy the business of the Baron, although we do not of course know it, this is the time that he takes the wallet from Kringelein and puts it in his own pocket. \nWe might perhaps remember a sudden turn away in which we see his back and his right hand raised as though reaching in his inside pocket -- \nHe stands looking down at Kringelein. \nDOCTOR (drops Kringelein's hand) It will be over in a minute. \nKringelein's eyes flutter. His voice sounds hoarsely: \nKRINGELEIN Over -- over so soon -- it has just begun. (he closes his eyes suddenly) Oh, the pain. \nDOCTOR Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be afraid. \nKRINGELEIN (mutteringly) I'd like to live a little longer but -- I'm not afraid to die -- I'm not... \nBARON (touching his shoulder gently) You'll be all right, Kringelein. (he moves from the bed -- takes out a cigarette, moves to the table. He seizes his drink) \nKRINGELEIN'S VOICE (out of scene) My pocketbook... my money in it... \nDOCTOR'S VOICE What do you say -- what? \nWe watch Baron's face, he looks back over his shoulder. \nDOCTOR'S VOICE You what -- Oh, isn't it there? \nKRINGELEIN'S VOICE No -- But no I -- Baron, I've lost my pocketbook. \nBaron turns in this scene. He walks forward toward them. \nThe Doctor's hands are on Kringelein's coat. \nDOCTOR There is no pocketbook here... On the floor probably. (He glances down) \nKRINGELEIN (starting up suddenly) More than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook. \nDOCTOR (looking at Baron) Fourteen thousand marks... One can travel -- one's happiness might depend on fourteen thousand marks -- don't you think so, Baron? \nBARON (with a shrug) Quite possibly. \nAt that moment, Kringelein, who has been staring up at the ceiling, his hands clenching and reclenching, starts up. \nKRINGELEIN Oh, I've got to find it. \nDOCTOR Stay where you are. \nCAMERA FOLLOWS HER as she tiptoes to her room. She closes the door noiselessly and listens. She throws off her hat and takes off her coat. Opens her bag and takes out night dress, lingerie, etc. The lid of her bag falls suddenly. She starts at the noise. \"Has it awakened him.\" She looks off. \nSHOT AT BATHROOM DOOR \nThe thin stream of light is filled suddenly, the door of the adjoining room opens and back-lighted from the other room the huge form of Preysing appears. In this odd lighting he is a little more than Preysing. He comes forward. He speaks hoarsely, quietly. \nPREYSING Flaemmchen! (he seizes her to him) \nShe goes to his arms passively. He rubs his face in her hair. She is passive -- cold. \nPREYSING (breathlessly) You are late. I've been waiting for you -- waiting. \nFLAEMMCHEN I had to arrange about the trip. \nPREYSING You're sweet. \nFLAEMMCHEN You think so? \nHe holds her again, trying to kiss her. She deliberately avoids his kiss. \nPREYSING (awkwardly) Come here. (he sits heavily on the bed, sitting on her night dress.) \nFLAEMMCHEN Here, hold up! \nPreysing rises while she pulls her night dress from under him. \nHe draws her to him. \nFLAEMMCHEN Oh -- careful, Mr. Preysing. \nPREYSING Call me -- do you know -- would you -- would you like to call me by my first name? \nFLAEMMCHEN (pulling away, glad of an excuse for conversation) Oh, no. \nPREYSING Why not? \nFLAEMMCHEN I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me. \nPREYSING You're a funny little creature, Flaemmchen. I can't make you out. \nFLAEMMCHEN It's not funny at all. One can't get intimate just off hand. I could go to England with you and everything like that -- supposing I met you next year and I said: 'How do you do, Mr. Preysing! And you said: (she imitates him) 'That was the young lady who was my secretary in Manchester'. \nPreysing laughs. She laughs. \nFLAEMMCHEN That's all quite proper. (she is happy again. She would rather talk than be squeezed) But supposing I met you when you were with your wife and I called out: \"Hello you big baby -- remember Manchester?' And you with your wife, how would you like that? \nThere is a pause for a moment. \nPREYSING Please, Flaemmchen -- we'll leave my wife out of this. \nFlaemmchen yawns straight in his face. \nFLAEMMCHEN All right. I'll get undressed -- get out. \nHe moves towards the windows which are open. She pushes his fat body out, almost playfully, through the doors and onto the balcony. \nPreysing stands out on the balcony. He looks down in the street below, then off. He starts suddenly because he sees a shadow over the railing of his own balcony. He is puzzled. Shadow crosses again. \"Who can be in his room?\" He moves forward and peeps through the window. One side of the French window is closed. From his angle we see the Baron furtively searching the room. He is now wearing an overcoat, the collar is turned up. Business ad lib. He finds Preysing's wallet. He stuffs this in his overcoat pocket. Preysing's face watching him. As Baron turns to exit, Preysing surges forward, pulling the window after him. The two men face each other. \nPREYSING Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want here? \nBARON I must have made a mistake. \nPREYSING Made a mistake -- remarkable. We shall soon see if you made a mistake. (the Baron starts to leave.) (bellowing) Stay here... Give me that money. \nThe Baron hands him the pocketbook without a word. \nPREYSING So that's how we stand, Baron. \nBARON Look here, sir -- I'm completely at your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's a matter of life or death -- I had to get some money -- tonight. \nPREYSING Indeed you must, Baron -- you must. Humm -- humm, but you must go to jail, Baron, you're a thief. \nBARON Be quiet. \nPREYSING I'm going to call the police. I'm going to watch you play the great Baron with the police. Aristocrat! Aristocrat! (he picks up the telephone) \nThe Baron makes for the door on the other side of the room, pulls at the knob. \nPREYSING The door is locked, Baron. \nThe Baron makes one dive across the room. Preysing grasps at his coat and tears it. With one hand holding the telephone, (the receiver dropping on its cord towards the ground) and one hand holding the Baron. \nPREYSING (into telephone) Hello! Hello! -- \nBARON Don't do that. (he tries to snatch the telephone from Preysing.) \nPreysing wrenches the telephone suddenly away from the Baron. The action excites him. \nPREYSING Strike me, would you? Attack me would you? Attack me -- \nWith a terrific lunge, Preysing brings the telephone down upon the Baron's head. The Baron sways, stunned. (as in book). In his mad rage, Preysing, hits again with the telephone. \nPREYSING I'll strike you -- I'll strike you -- I'll strike you -- Strike me! \nBy this time the Baron is a heap on the floor. We see Preysing come out of his blind trance. He even repeats again. \nPREYSING I strike you -- (with telephone foolishly in his hand, he looks down at what he has done.) \nCUT TO: \nPREYSING No -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money. \nKRINGELEIN Oh, no -- no -- not the Baron. \nPREYSING (suddenly) Where is that girl -- she was working with him -- she enticed me into her room. \nKRINGELEIN Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing. \nPREYSING (frantically) I can answer for this, it was self- defense -- I can answer for this -- but that girl -- the scandal -- my wife -- my daughters, you know them? \nKRINGELEIN Yes, I know them -- \nPREYSING The scandal -- we are men -- you -- you could take that affair of the young lady upon yourself -- take her and hold your tongue. Then you can travel -- I'll give you anything -- anything -- she was with you. \nKRINGELEIN We must call the police, your excellency. \nPreysing takes him by the shoulders. \nPREYSING How much -- how much do you want -- you need money -- you have nothing. \nKRINGELEIN Don't worry about me, Mr. General Director Pryesing -- worry about yourself. (he picks up receiver) There has been a murder -- this is room one sixty-four. \nCUT TO: \nTELEPHONE ROOM \nTelephone girl plugs in. \nGIRL Hello -- hurry up... hurry up... someone in one sixty-four says there has been a murder. \nCUT TO: \nHALL PORTER \nThe scene gradually grows intense. Porter calls night man. \nPORTER Here - quick - here -- go to one sixty-four immediately. (calls back on telephone) Give me Mr. Rohna -- Rohna the manager. \nCUT TO: \nROHNA'S ROOM \nDarkened room. Bell ringing. Rohna sits up in bed, turns on light, picks up telephone; on his face we see him hear the news. \nROHNA Where?... murder?... who?... all right, I'm coming. Wait a minute. (speaks in a monotone) Instruct everyone to use the utmost tact -- we must have no scandal in the Grand Hotel. Answer no questions, I'm coming now -- inform the police. \n(he replaces the telephone commences dressing quickly) \nCUT TO: \nGRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM \nTrunks standing around everywhere. Suzette is finishing packing. Grusinskaya is sitting in front of the mirror in a loose night wrap -- she is doing her hair. \nSUZETTE Madam should sleep. \nGRUSINSKAYA I've done my hair differently -- do you like that? \nSUZETTE When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently. \nGRUSINSKAYA (rising) In the middle of the night -- those flowers make me think of a funeral. Laurels and tube-roses. (she pushes the window closed, shivers, it is chilly. She crosses the room turning out one of the lights) Oh, think, Suzette -- the Villa and the sun at Tremezzo -- quiet -- simple -- happy -- we'll have a guest, Suzette. \nSUZETTE (quietly) Yes, Madam. And now Madam will sleep. It is not long 'till the train. \nGRUSINSKAYA Goodnight, Suzette. \nSuzette leaves -- turning out a light. \nAlone, Grusinskaya goes to the telephone. She raises the receiver. \nGRUSINSKAYA Hello -- can you tell me if Baron von Gaigern is in his room -- ring him. (talking to herself) Cherie, I must wake you or you'll miss the train. (into phone) ...yes... are you ringing, he may be asleep. (to herself) Cherie, you must get up and fetch me from my room -- I'm longing for you, Cherie -- I have not been to sleep -- I kept thinking you would come to me. (into phone) ...Oh, but he must answer. Ring -- ring -- ring. \nCUT IN HERE at discretion the: \nBARON'S EMPTY ROOM \nTelephone is ringing. \nCUT BACK TO: \nGRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM \nGRUSINSKAYA (to herself) Cherie, hurry -- hurry -- hurry. Answer the phone -- what is the matter. (into phone) Ring him -- ring him. (to herself) Where are you -- where are you, Cherie? Why don't you answer? (into phone) Well, ring him -- please -- please. \nFADE OUT SLOWLY: \nEND OF SEQUENCE \"#6\" \nSEQUENCE \"#7\" \nMusic up as we -- \nFADE IN ON: \nDISSOLVE INTO - EXTERIOR SERVICE ENTRANCE OF HOTEL \nThe trees and the milk cart effect and other curious signs of dawn, which we remember after the climax of the first sequence. \nMusic cold and eerie. \nAs Kringelein emerges from the elevator, Suzette speaking to the Floor Clerk. \nSUZETTE And they've taken him away. \nFLOOR CLERK Yes -- it's terrible. \nSUZETTE Madam must not know -- you understand -- Madam must not know. \nFLOOR CLERK I will tell the maids. I cannot answer for downstairs -- \nSuzette hurries down corridor. By this time Kringelein has arrived at his door, he opens it. \nCUT TO: \nKRINGELEIN'S ROOM \nKringelein opens the door and enters. Flaemmchen is looking into space. A lovely picture. Morning light over her hair, she is dressed. \nKRINGELEIN What's the matter? \nFLAEMMCHEN Oh -- I was thinking -- Poor Baron -- Lying there, his eyes so open. \nKRINGELEIN You loved the Baron, didn't you? \nFLAEMMCHEN Yes -- \nKRINGELEIN So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was. \nFLAEMMCHEN Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that. \nKRINGELEIN He was in desperate straits. He'd been trying to raise money all day. He laughed -- Poor devil! And then a man like Preysing kills him. \nFLAEMMCHEN (naively) I didn't like Preysing right off. \nKRINGELEIN Then why did you have anything to do with him? \nFLAEMMCHEN (simply) Money! \nKRINGELEIN Yes, of course, -- money! \nFLAEMMCHEN You don't understand that do you? \nKRINGELEIN Of course I do -- I never knew what money really meant till I started spending it. Do you know -- (he is silent a moment) I can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing -- I'll take care of you. Will -- will you let me? \nFLAEMMCHEN What? \nKRINGELEIN You'll have a good time with me. Want to? I've got enough money. Ten thousand two hundred in my pocketbook. Three thousand four hundred that I won. It will last a long time. I can win more -- we'll travel. \nFLAEMMCHEN Yes -- to Paris? I wanted to go there always. \nKRINGELEIN Wherever you like. Here I'll give you the money I won, three thousand four hundred. Later you can have more. \nFLAEMMCHEN Later? \nKRINGELEIN When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It will not be long -- I'll not last long. Will you stay with me until... \nFLAEMMCHEN Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor, he'll cure you. They can cure anything these days. \nKRINGELEIN Do you believe that you will have a better time with me than you would with Preysing? \nFLAEMMCHEN Oh yes, of course. \nKRINGELEIN (takes her hands) Do you like me better? \nFLAEMMCHEN You're a good man, Mr. Kringelein -- a very good man. \nKringelein straightens, happy, inspired, a smile on his face. He assumes in his gestures. Takes the telephone. \nKRINGELEIN (into telephone) When is the next train leaving for Paris? -- Yes... Get two tickets for me... and my bill please... and the lady's -- Miss Flaemm's. (puts down telephone) (to Flaemmchen) We have to hurry let's pack -- we'll have breakfast on the train. \nCUT TO: \nCORRIDOR \nThe figure of Grusinskaya is standing at her door, there is no one with her. Suzette steps out. \nSUZETTE Madam, it is Mr. Meierheim -- he is waiting downstairs. \nGRUSINSKAYA Where is Pimenov? Where is Pimenov? (she looks off.) \nFLASH OF PIMENOV \ncoming out of the elevator. \nGrusinskaya hurries down to Pimenov -- they meet. \nPIMENOV (breathlessly) He will be on the train. \nGRUSINSKAYA But when did he go? How do you know? \nShe crosses and looks in the Baron's room. A maid is there changing the bedding. The room is unoccupied otherwise. \nGRUSINSKAYA Baron von Gaigern has left? \nThe maid nods. \nGRUSINSKAYA When? How long ago? \nMaid shrugs her shoulders. \n", "test1_input": "KRINGELEIN I came here because I wanted to live here, two weeks, maybe three -- God only knows -- I've told you I'll pay -- I'll pay anything you ask. I'm tired -- I'm ill -- I can't wait. \nAs he finishes the Doctor draws into the scene -- he is watching. \nAssistant Manager enters. \nASSISTANT MANAGER Has the gentleman a complaint? \nRohna and Kringelein speak together. \nROHNA The gentleman is dissatisfied with room number five fifty-nine. \nKRINGELEIN I certainly have a complaint -- and a fair one. \nHe senses an audience and warms up. The Baron and Pimenov enter the scene. The lady and gentleman have turned. The bellboy stands watching curiously and even Senf pauses and looks up. \nKRINGELEIN (continuing) I came here from a long distance to stay at the Grand Hotel. I want a room -- a big room -- like you would give General Director Preysing -- I'm as good as Mr. Preysing -- I can pay like Mr. Preysing -- would you give him a little room, way up in the corner with the hot water pipes going -- bang -- bang -- bang... (he bangs at the desk with his fist) \nDOCTOR This gentleman can have my room. \nKRINGELEIN (turning) Oh! \nDOCTOR Send his bags up to my room. \nKRINGELEIN Oh -- but -- I -- \nDOCTOR You're tired. I can see that. \nKRINGELEIN Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have been ill... \nDOCTOR You are ill. \nDuring this scene the manager has been talking with Rohna quietly. The manager how turns. \nMANAGER Mr. Kringelein will take room number one-seventy-six, one of our most expensive rooms. It is large and on the front with bath. \nKRINGELEIN (subdued -- exhausted --) Does that mean that the bath is my own? --- Private? \nMANAGER Certainly, sir. \nKRINGELEIN Well, now, that's very kind -- thanks. That's what I want -- a large room on the front with a private bath -- Yes, that's what I want. I can pay now if you like. \nHe takes out his wallet and nervously commences to extract money. \nDOCTOR That will not be necessary. \nThe manager is instructing the bellboy to take Kringelein to the new room. \nKringelein accidentally drops a bill -- the Baron, who has noticed the money, stoops to pick it up. \nIn bending himself, Kringelein drops his hat. \nBaron picks up the hat and considerately brushes it with his sleeve. \nKRINGELEIN Thank you, sir. \nBARON (amused) Not at all, sir. (he beams) \nKRINGELEIN (finding a friendly face) Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf. \nBARON I'm Baron von Gaigern. \nKRINGELEIN Oh, a Baron! (he is impressed) \nBaron catches the mood of making this gentleman suddenly popular. \nBARON And this is Doctor Otternschlag. \nKRINGELEIN (turning to Doctor) Oh -- Doctor -- you are a Doctor -- I am -- \nDOCTOR I know -- I know -- when a man's collar is an inch too big for him -- I know he is ill. \nKRINGELEIN Yes -- Oh -- oh -- yes, -- (his finger goes nervously to his collar) \nZinnowitz passes through scene quickly on his way out. \nAt that moment, Pimenov returns from the news-stand, where he has bought the evening papers. \nPIMENOV Well, Baron -- I must go and dress. \nKRINGELEIN (to doctor) Is this gentleman a Baron, too? \nPIMENOV (laughing) Unfortunately no. \nThe Manager comes into scene. \nMANAGER Will Mr. Kringelein kindly register. \nKRINGELEIN Again? \nMANAGER Please. \nKringelein turns to the desk. The Doctor turns up with him. \nAt that moment the Baron's chauffeur touches his arm. \nCHAUFFEUR Have you a minute now? \nBARON No -- I told you not to come in this lobby. \n", "test1_true": "BARON I've told you a hundred times not to speak to me with a cigarette in your mouth. \nChauffeur takes the cigarette out of his mouth -- but still holds it in his hand. \nCHAUFFEUR I want to speak -- \nBARON Not now. \nCHAUFFEUR Yes, sir. \nThe Baron leaves. \nGeneral moving off, towards elevator, of Baron, Pimenov, Kringelein and the Doctor. \nSENF'S DESK \nOn another shot, shooting profile onto Senf's desk, bring in Flaemmchen. Flaemmchen enters. Her back to CAMERA. \nFLAEMMCHEN (we hear her ask) Mr. Preysing. \nSENF Will you wait please. \nCLERK The stenographer is to go up -- Mr. Preysing telephoned. \nSENF Mr. Preysing -- one sixty-four. \nFLAEMMCHEN Thanks -- (calling off to elevator) Heigh! -- Wait! \nShe crosses to elevator. \nTHE CAMERA RUSHES UP BEHIND HER, ALMOST PUSHING INTO ELEVATOR WITH HER. \nAs she enters the elevator and the gate shuts, she turns around, back pressed against the Baron -- who is looking down at her. The look on her face is the look we often see on Flaemmchen's in elevators when they are pressed. \nNOTE: Good introduction, for Flaemmchen. \nThe lift ascends. \nUPPER CORRIDOR \nFlaemmchen steps out of the lift. She is looking around for the numbers. She moves out of scene. \nThe Doctor, Kringelein and the bellboy with the bag, move straight down the hall. \nPimenov is chatting volubly. \nPIMENOV (to Baron) Poor Grusinskaya -- how can she receive anyone. She can't -- theatre, trains, hotels -- hotels, trains theatre. \nWe see Flaemmchen being directed by the floor clerk to Mr. Preysing's room. \nPIMENOV (continuing) I must go and dress -- she'll be waking up and calling for me. \nHe proceeds up the passage, pompously, humming the air of his ballet. \nAt that moment, Flaemmchen, who has been directed to Preysing's door, by floor clerk, passes the Baron and there is an amusing exchange of glances between them. \nFlaemmchen knocking at Preysing's door hears a voice. \nPREYSING'S VOICE Come in. \nShe opens the door. \nCUT TO: \nPREYSING'S ROOM \nPreysing has had a bath and is actually steaming from it. He stands before a long mirror, rubbing himself with a towel. \nHe sees her through the mirror, wraps the towel around him very cutely, for a big man, and turns upon her. \nPREYSING What...! -- \nFLAEMMCHEN I'm the stenographer. \nPREYSING Then you will please wait outside. \nHe is very much affronted. \nFlaemmchen, who has seen many large gentlemen in the altogether -- \nFLAEMMCHEN (lightly) Don't hurry -- take your time. \nShe goes out of the room and shuts the door. \nCUT TO: \nUPPER CORRIDOR \nFlaemmchen emerges from Preysing's room. \nBaron loitering in the hall. (Whistling as outlined). Baron approaches, he is also whistling -- the same tune that Flaemmchen is whistling. She glances at him, as he continues whistling with an amusing dance step, as much as to say: \"Are you mad?\" \nBARON Like dancing? \nFLAEMMCHEN Not with strangers. \nBaron glances back up the passage; it is apparent that he is going to make conversation here with this girl, in order to keep legitimately in the passage until Grusinskaya comes out. \nBARON (turning to Flaemmchen) Never? \n", "test1_id": 408, "test2_input": "Preysing paces the room with the telegram. \nFlaemmchen rises, stretches. Quite naturally she glances at the pictures on Preysing's dressing-table. \nFLAEMMCHEN How nice -- your daughters? \nPREYSING My daughters -- yes, my daughters. (he is talking more to himself) \nFLAEMMCHEN Is that Mrs. Preysing. \nPREYSING (to himself) Definitely off. \nFLAEMMCHEN Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel? (she is looking at picture of Mrs. Preysing) \nPREYSING (turns, speaks quickly -- definitely) That'll be all -- be here tomorrow at nine o'clock. (he turns, goes out onto balcony with telegram) \nFlaemmchen, delighted and with alacrity, crosses, piles up her papers and is prepared to leave. \nCUT TO: \nFLASH OF CORRIDOR \nTrim Flaemmchen out of Preysing's room. Take her down to elevator. \nAt the same time, CAMERA PANS OVER and shows the Baron's chauffeur knocking at the Baron's door. \nBARON'S VOICE (calling) Come in! \nTrim the chauffeur into the Baron's room. \nBARON'S ROOM \nBaron is busy changing his clothes. Chauffeur steps in, he closes the door behind him and stands there with an inquisitive look. \nCHAUFFEUR You are late -- the dancer's gone to the theatre. \nBARON (very nonchalantly) Well? \nCHAUFFEUR She's gone to the theatre -- don't you know? \nBARON (very nonchalantly) Yes. \nCHAUFFEUR (ready to explode) And what are you going to do? \nBARON The pearls are in her room. \nCHAUFFEUR (threateningly) Now listen to me. The others are getting suspicious of you. I was on the telephone to Amsterdam today, they think you're scared. \nBARON I've been careful, I've been waiting my chance. \nCHAUFFEUR You've been waiting your chance. You're too much of a gentleman -- that's the trouble with you. \nBARON I told you I'll get the pearls tonight. \nCHAUFFEUR Need any help? \nBARON No. \nCHAUFFEUR Have you got that skeleton key? \nHe takes the skeleton key out of his pocket and produces it to the Baron. \nBARON No -- \nCHAUFFEUR Why? \nBARON The floor clerk is out there in the corridor -- she sees everything --- \nCHAUFFEUR (contemptuously) I could take care of her. \nBARON How? \nCHAUFFEUR Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you... \nBARON No -- no -- no -- no... \nCHAUFFEUR Why? \nBARON Poor girl -- chloroform would give her a rotten headache... I know -- I had it in the war. Besides, she's very pretty -- not young but -- \nCHAUFFEUR You're no good for this business. It's just a joke to you... \nBARON (swings suddenly on him) I don't like your tone. \nCHAUFFEUR (comes up to him -- face to face) No -- \nBaron is suddenly seized with uncontrollable temper -- twists his wrists -- backs him to door, speaks quietly. \nBARON Get out and leave it to me... be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam... \nCHAUFFEUR With the pearls? \nBARON With the pearls -- \nThe Chauffeur leaves. \nThe moment he is gone -- Baron looks the door -- business ad lib. \nCrosses to window. \n", "test2_true": "The Baron peeps out onto balcony -- it seems to be clear. He proceeds along and peeps into Preysing's room. Preysing is apparently in the bathroom. Baron skips nimbly past the room. \nWorking at thrill of pass through to Grusinskaya's room. \nGRUSINSKAYA'S BALCONY \nBaron is pretty shaken by jump. \nCUT TO: \nGRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM \nDarkness -- light from transom and building opposite. \nBusiness of finding key and getting pearls. INTERCUT Preysing coming out onto his balcony, bringing out with him, loud speaker of radio -- which announces noisily as follows: \nLOUD SPEAKER 'You are listening to the music of the Eastman Jazz Band, in the famous Yellow Room of the Grand Hotel.' \nCUT TO: \nGRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM \nBaron starts suddenly -- when he hears voice and with pearls in his hand, looks cautiously out of window -- only to see: \nCUT TO: \nSHOT FROM HIS ANGLE ONTO PREYSING'S BALCONY: \nPreysing seating himself upon his balcony -- Radio loud speaker seen. Possibly Preysing commences dinner scene bullying waiter. \nGRUSINSKAYA'S BALCONY \nThe Baron knows he is trapped, if he jumps onto Preysing's balcony, Preysing is the man that will cause the alarm. \nQuickly he moves across the room -- tries the door -- it is locked securely. He looks for skeleton key and then remembers refusing it from the chauffeur. He is trapped in an absurd way. \nAs he moves back from the door, he knocks the telephone off of the table. He watches it for a moment, realizing that the operator must now know that there is someone in Grusinskaya's room. \nHe picks up the telephone, replaces the receiver, wipes finger prints off with his handkerchief. \nHe is moving back to window when telephone starts to ring suddenly. The thought crosses his mind they they will want to know who is in the room. He lets the telephone ring. Crosses to the door again. \nAbove the din of the telephone we hear the chambermaid's voice singing an absurd song. \nHe listens. She is coming in. \nThe key turns in the door. \nQuickly he hides behind the curtains. \nSlowly and amusingly the chambermaid, tired and dragging, enters the room. \nHe is looking for an opportunity to dash through the door. After all, this maid should be an easy person to get around. We have a feeling he wishes to dash through the door. \nThe chambermaid might be singing the same tune that we hear from Preysing's radio. \nThe telephone commences ringing. Chambermaid does not answer it but continues her duties. \nAt last, because of the noise of the telephone, she picks it up and speaks. \nCHAMBERMAID No -- no -- there is no one here. (she replaces the receiver) \nAt that moment, the Inspectress, a large stout woman, appears at the open door. \nINSPECTRESS (to Chambermaid) You're late... What have you been doing? \nCHAMBERMAID (grumbling) Everyone -- all the time says, 'Come back - come back.' They won't get out of their rooms. \nThe Inspectress, in a very businesslike way, proceeds around the room, coming nearer and nearer the Baron. She is looking at ashtrays and running her fingers over the woodwork looking for dust. She tries the door to the next room, to see if it is locked. \nTelephone bell rings again. \nInspectress picks it up quickly. \nINSPECTRESS No, Madame Grusinskaya is not here... The Western Theater?... No... \nSuddenly, out of scene, we hear the voice of Suzette. \nSuzette is calling out to the night clerk in the passage. \nSUZETTE'S VOICE Have you seen Madame? \nCLERK'S VOICE (replying) Isn't she at the theatre? \nSuzette comes in and hurries to telephone. \nSUZETTE Hello, hello, Mr. Pimenov? Yes... Mr. Pimenov, have they found her?... No, she is not here... Yes, I'm at the hotel. \nINTERCUT \nWith the Baron watching. \nGRUSINSKAYA'S BALCONY \nDuring this action the Inspectress has waven the chambermaid out of the room. Business ad lib. \nMeierheim enters, he has heard the word 'Pimenov' on the telephone -- he takes the receiver from Suzette. \nMEIERHEIM (into telephone) Pimenov?... What's happening?... No, I haven't found her. Is Desprez dancing?... How is it?... Oh, all right. Keep the show going. (bangs down receiver) Wait till I see her, she'll pay for this -- this little trick is going to cost Grusinskaya a suit for breach of contract. \n", "test2_id": 409, "test3_input": "SUZETTE Madame is ill -- her nerves... \nMEIERHEIM Her nerves... What about my nerves?... Who is she anyway? Where does she think she is -- Russia? Those days have passed. \nHe turns and sees Grusinskaya standing at the door. She is in costume, very pale, very beautiful. Her coat, over one shoulder, is ragging, she lets it drop and moves slowly into the center of the room. Her hair, dressed for the dance, make-up is on her face -- she is breathless. \nSUZETTE Madame -- \nMEIERHEIM Well? \nGRUSINSKAYA I want to be alone. \nThe other women in the room draw out, leaving Suzette to pick up the robe that has fallen to the floor. \nMEIERHEIM Where have you been? \nSUZETTE Should I -- Does madame wish... \nGRUSINSKAYA Suzette, please go, I want to be alone. \nSuzette obediently crosses to door and pauses on threshold, waiting for Meierheim. \nMeierheim approaches Grusinskaya. \nMEIERHEIM I suppose I can cancel the Vienna engagement. \nGRUSINSKAYA I wish to be alone. \nMEIERHEIM You'll be very much alone, my dear madame. This is the end. (he stamps out) \nSuzette, with a frightened look through the door, closes it on Meierheim's exit. \nDURING THIS SCENE, INTERCUT SHOTS OF BARON. \nIt is some time before Grusinskaya moves. She crosses to door -- turns the key -- takes the key out of the lock and throws it away from her -- out upon the floor. She crosses slowly to the mirror, regards herself, silently. We hear the strains from Preysing's radio playing a light Viennese waltz. \nGrusinskaya begins suddenly to sob. \nFLASH OF BARON \nWatching her. \nGRUSINSKAYA \nQuite suddenly -- as if with resolution she begins to undress. Then she becomes weary again. \nWith a garment in her hand, she moves slowly toward the curtain -- where the Baron is standing. \nBARON \nWe see him tense himself. \nGRUSINSKAYA \nShe drops the garment listlessly to the floor -- moves out of scene. \nCLOSEUP OF BARON \nHe peeps around the curtains. \nCUT TO: \nGRUSINSKAYA \nShe is in a thin robe. She sits before mirror -- looks steadily at her face. Her head goes down suddenly in her hands and we hear her say: \nGRUSINSKAYA The end -- over -- finished -- \nSuddenly she moves quickly across the room. Goes to bathroom. \nBaron half starts out toward door. He watches -- darts across the room as if towards the door. He hears her coming and darts quickly into the half open door of the closet. \nShe re-enters -- carrying a glass of water. She crosses, places the glass down beside the bed -- her movements are quick and furtive -- then she crosses, picks up the telephone -- asks for the theatre. \nGRUSINSKAYA The Western Theatre -- \nShe leaves receiver down -- crosses quickly to mirror -- stands there and brushes back her hair -- crosses back to telephone speaks: \nGRUSINSKAYA Western Theatre? \nShe glances up at the clock. \nGRUSINSKAYA The stage -- Mr. Pimonov -- the ballet master... Grusinskaya -- hurry -- hurry. \nAgain she puts the receiver down -- picking up a pencil she commences hastily to scribble a note. She writes frantically. Her other hand goes up and picks up the receiver. \nGRUSINSKAYA Yes -- yes, I'm waiting. \nShe finishes the note -- commences suddenly to speak into the telephone -- \nGRUSINSKAYA Hello, Pimenov? -- I'm at the hotel. I couldn't go on -- I couldn't... No, no don't -- (long pause) ...Just alone... Good night, good night, my dear -- goodbye... Pimenov, how is it going, badly?... Uh?... Who's dancing?... Desprez?... Oh -- and how is it?... Oh, -- oh, I see -- they didn't miss me?... They didn't miss me. (she lets her hand drop with the receiver and goes on talking into the air) They didn't miss me -- good night, Pimenov... \nShe is about to replace the receiver. She sits with it in her hand, unreplaced. \nThe music has stopped. The room is strangely silent. Behind her the Baron peers from the closet. \nHer head sinks down upon her hands. \nA funny, singing noise comes from the telephone. She lifts the receiver to her ear. In a very strange voice, the voice of Opehlia, she speaks: \n", "test3_true": "The foregoing scene is much better played than described. It is in fact, ballet. \nQuite calmly, Grusinskaya finishes the notes on the table. She folds it up and places it in a prominent place on the table, or hangs it over the telephone. \nShe crosses to the window pulls back the curtains -- the Baron has been hiding behind a few minutes before. \nWe see the Baron watching. He glances at the door quickly. \"No, there is not time.\" She is returning calmly. She crosses to the dressing table and takes the veronal out of a drawer. She looks at it thoughtfully, her lips are trembling a little. She moves to the radiator as if to seek warmth. \nShe sinks into a chair and her head droops over her folded hands which contain the veronal, she seems to pray. \nThe Baron comes from the closet -- now is his chance, he looks at the door but can't make it. Looks on the floor for the key which Grusinskaya has previously thrown there, his eyes fall upon the note on the telephone -- he reads it. \nIt is a death farewell note to Suzette -- do not insert it. \nAt this moment she has finished, the Baron returns to his hiding place. She makes the sign of a cross and goes to her bed. \nShe looks around nervously, apprehensively -- like a deer who has heard something, then reassured. She places the veronal on the night table beside the glass of water. She is quiet and deliberate. She arranges the pillows under her head and lies down. She reaches for the bottle of veronal and empties it generously in her hand. She has to lean away upon one elbow, from the Baron's position, in order to balance herself. \nThe Baron steps like a cat from his hiding place. He goes to the bedside noiselessly and stands there. \nShe reaches for the glass-her hand stretches out for the glass. The Baron takes her wrist suddenly. \nShe turns quickly looking at him. The glass falls to the floor with a crash and breaks. As she moves, the veronal falls out of her hands upon the bed. She struggles up to a sitting position. \nBARON Please, do not be alarmed, Madam. \nShe glances up at him. She is bewildered. She seems to be coming out of a trance. Again she wants to jump from the bed. \nBARON Careful -- there's broken glass on the floor. \nNow she becomes conscious of almost nakedness. She draws her kimono tightly around her, glances across the wide expanse of bed. We see her consider passing over that way, but she is now a woman again -- a woman of the earth -- it would be a silly movement. \nBARON There. (takes a pillow from the bed throws it upon the floor over the glass, steps back) \nShe gets up quickly and crosses, putting on her robe which was lying across the back of a chair. \nHer first movement is not one of alarm but of -- shame. She draws her robe more closely around her and looks at the Baron puzzled. She thinks, dreamily, \"What is this?\" She glances back at the veronal and the bed showing us plainly that this man must have watched her preparation for bed. We get a sense of relief with her. She is trembling. \nThe Baron has controlled his nerves perfectly. He senses his danger. He is caught red-handed with five hundred thousand marks worth of pearls in his pocket. He is wondering if she will ring the bell. For an instant he thinks of escape. He could dash for the balcony. He could strike her dead or silence her with threats. There is in the room an intoxicating sense of romance and danger. (It should be in the scene.) \nBARON Please do not be frightened, Madam. \nGRUSINSKAYA (after a silence) What do you want here? \nBARON Nothing -- only to be here. \nGRUSINSKAYA Why do you hide in my room? \nBARON But surely you must know -- because I love you. \nGRUSINSKAYA Because you love me -- you love me? \nShe looks at him for a few moments and then suddenly she throws herself upon the bed and begins to weep more and more passionately. \nBARON (going over to her) Poor little Grusinskaya! Does it do you good to cry? Are you afraid? Shall I go? \nGRUSINSKAYA I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that. (sitting up) No. I am not afraid. It is strange. \nBARON Don't cry -- it tears my heart to see you sob like that. \nGRUSINSKAYA (regaining control) Nerves -- just nerves. You must forgive me. I have had a bad evening. I am very tired. Do you know what it is to be tired -- tired of a routine existence? \nBARON I'm afraid not -- I usually do just what I feel like doing at the moment. \nA look in his eyes reminds her of the strangeness of the situation. She rises with returning dignity and pulls her robe around her -- she is becoming the Grusinskaya of Imperial Russia; she is the woman Grand Dukes have fought for. She sweeps across the room. \nGRUSINSKAYA So you feel like coming into a lady's room -- and you come... What now? \nBARON (following her) I'd like to smoke a cigarette. \nGRUSINSKAYA Certainly. \nShe gets her cigarette box from the writing table and holds it out to him. He takes a cigarette and lights it. She watches him curiously. She smiles, as she watches him greedily inhale the smoke. She crosses and sits before her looking glass. She brushes her hair back and powders her face. She looks into the mirror, we feel that she has regained a desire to live. He crosses and looks at her in the mirror. He smiles. \nGRUSINSKAYA Why do you look at me like that? \nBARON I did not know you were so beautiful... and -- \nGRUSINSKAYA (bitterly) And then --? \nBARON No irony. You're so appealing -- so soft -- so tired. I feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you -- ever. \nGRUSINSKAYA (involuntarily closing her eyes) And -- and -- \nBARON How tired you are! \nGRUSINSKAYA Yes -- tired... \nBARON So alone. \nGRUSINSKAYA Alone. All alone. (whispers in Russian) Oh, you strange -- strange creature. \nBARON You mustn't talk Russian to me. \nGRUSINSKAYA Strange man... \nBARON Am I quite strange to you? \nGRUSINSKAYA Not quite strange now.

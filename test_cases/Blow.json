GUARJIRA, COLOMBIA - 1989 - DAY \nA majestic panorama of the lush green slopes that are the Columbian highlands.  A faint chopping sound IS HEARD and then another.  WHOOSH.  WHOOSH.  The view changes and tiny dots appear on the hillside vegetation.  WHOOSH. \nCLOSER \nWe realize the dots are people.  Workers swinging long steel machetes in slow methodical rhythm.  WHOOSH.  WHOOSH.  WE SEE the South American Indian MEN clearly now.  Their tar stained teeth.  Their gaunt faces riddled with crow's feet.  Their jaws chewing away on huge wads of coca leaves as they collect the harvest. \nEXT. DIRT ROAD - COLOMBIA - DAY \nOld rickety trucks carrying the huge green tractor-sized bales speed along the narrow road. \nEXT. CLEARING - COLOMBIA - DAY \nThe bundles are undone and Columbian women separate out the leaves.  Tribes of underweight workers carry armload after armload of the harvest and ritualistically dump them into a gigantic cannibal pot which sits on top of a raging bonfire. The leaves are being boiled down and a huge plume of smoke streaks the sky.  Wizened Indios brave the heat and shovel ashes into the pot to cool the solution. \nINT. JUNGLE - COLOMBIA - DAY \nA primitive but enormous makeshift lab contains all the equipment.  The machinery.  The solutions.  The over-sized vats.  Dark-skinned bandoleros smoke cigarettes and sport automatic weapons at all the points of entry.  The coca is now a \"basuco\" paste and is being sent in for a wash. \nINT.

COLLEGE ADMISSIONS OFFICE - WEYMOUTH - 1966 - DAY \nGeorge stands in line to register for college, wearing his Brooks Brothers suit, bowtie, and freshly Bryllcreamed hair. The room is crowded and the line is long.  Bob Dylan's \"Subterranean Homesick Blues\" blares out of one of the kid's transistor radios.  George looks around the room.  He is uncomfortable.  He catches his reflection in the shiny glass partition and stops.  He doesn't like what he sees. Something is not right.  He looks like everyone else.  Same cookie-cutter hair, same cookie-cutter clothes, same cookie cutter faces.  He's a carbon copy. \nREGISTRATION WOMAN Next. \nIt's George's turn but he doesn't hear it.  \"Twenty years of schooling and they put you on a day shift.\"  The words hit him like a tone of bricks as he continues to stare at his own reflection. \nGEORGE (V.O.) I was standing there, and it was like the outside of me and the inside of me didn't match, you know?  And then I looked around the room and it hit me.  I saw my whole life.  Where I was gonna live, what type of car I'd drive, who my neighbors would be.  I saw it all and I didn't want it.  Not that life. \nEXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - WEYMOUTH - 1966 - DAY \nGeorge sits with Fred.  It's breaktime and Fred eats from a lunch box. \nGEORGE There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it. \nFRED That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family. \nGEORGE I know. \nFRED Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word. \nGEORGE No, Dad.  I don't want to...I mean, I just don't want... \nIt's obvious to Fred that his son doesn't want to be like him. \nFRED What are you going to do? \nGEORGE I'm going to California. \nEXT.

As George and Tuna struggle with the bags, two California beauties appear on the balcony next door: BARBARA BUCKLEY, 20, and MARIA GONZALES, 21. \nGIRLS You guys need some help? \nGEORGE It's oregano.  You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this? \nTUNA We sell it.  I got it all figured out. We make three finger lids and sell them on the beach.  We move all of it.  We've made ourselves a hundred bucks.  Or a lot of weed for our head.  What do you think?  Not bad, huh?  I got the baggies and everything. \nBARBARA You can't sell this to your friends. \nTUNA Man.

THE WHIPPING POST - MANHATTAN BEACH - 1968 - DAY \nGeorge, Barbara and Tuna stop outside the front door. \nGEORGE Are you sure this guy is cool? \nBARBARA You'll see for yourself. \nTUNA A beauty parlor for men?  Sounds pretty queer. \nThey walk in. \nINT. THE WHIPPING POST - MANHATTAN BEACH - 1968 - CONTINUOUS \nGeorge, Tuna and Barbara enter.  The Whipping Post is California's first male hair salon.  George looks around at the customer's being pampered.  Haircuts, pedicures, manicures. \nGEORGE Nothing like this back home. \nBARBARA Derek! \nDEREK FOREAL is a curious man.  Daringly effeminate, especially for the sixties, he is always surrounded by beautiful women.  As he sees Barbara, he stops his haircut and runs to embrace her. \nDEREK Barbie! \nDerek's female entourage rush over as well.  Kisses all around. \nDEREK (CONT'D) So, this is the new man, huh?  He's cute! \nGeorge and Tuna stick out there hands. \nGEORGE George. \nTUNA Tuna. \nDEREK Tuna, oh my.  Enchante, George.  Barbie, he's yummy.  He looks like a Ken doll. Oooh, Ken and Barbie.  It's perfect. Alright, girls, give me five minutes. \nDerek makes dismissing gestures and the girls scatter. \nDEREK (CONT'D) Everyone, shoo!  You, too, Barbie.  I want to talk to the boys alone. \nAfter the girls leave, Derek closes the partition and his playful demeanor changes.  He's all business now. \nDEREK (CONT'D) What can I do for you guys? \nGEORGE We want some grass. \nDEREK I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops? \nGEORGE No. \nDEREK Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment. \nGEORGE We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop? \nDEREK I guess not.  Okay.  You know, you're very lucky you're friends of Barbie's. If you weren't, I'd never talk to you. \nDerek pulls a television-sized brick of quality marijuana out from under a sink and sets it down in front of George. \nGEORGE What the fuck is that? \nDEREK It's your grass. \nTUNA Wow.  That's more than we had in mind. \nDEREK I don't nickel and dime.  You want it or not? \nGeorge and Tuna look at each other. \nGEORGE We'll take it. \nEXT.

The V.W. bug pulls up to an old ranch. They get out of the bug and are greeted by SANTIAGO and his THREE SONS. \nSANTIAGO Ramon tells me you are looking for some mota. \nGEORGE Yes, I am. \nSantiago moves to a tarp and pulls it back to reveal many bales of green, seedless sinsemilla. \nSANTIAGO For instance, something like this? \nGEORGE Very nice.  I'll take it. \nSANTIAGO Ha ha ha.  You are funny.   Really, how much will you be needing? \nGEORGE All of it.  As much as you've got.  A couples thousand pounds.  I'll be back in a week with a plane. \nSANTIAGO Listen, Americano, it is very nice to meet you, but maybe we are going too fast.  You take a little and then come back. \nGEORGE I don't need a little.  I need a lot. \nSANTIAGO Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I believe in yours, as well.  We must be careful. \nGEORGE What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars?  Would that eliminate some of your concerns? \nSANTIAGO Amigo, you bring me fifty-thousand dollars, and I have no more concerns. \nEXT. SANTA MONICA AIRPORT - 1968 - DAY \nA pair of boltcutters snaps the chain off a single-engine Cessna. \nTUNA I can't believe we're stealing a plane. \nKEVIN Don't be such a pussy. \nGEORGE It's fine.  We're not stealing it. We're borrowing it.  And try to look natural.  We've got company. \nA MECHANIC working on the adjacent plane is giving them the hairy eyeball. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) Be cool. \nThe three boys nod their heads in acknowledgement and give a small wave.  The mechanic smiles and waves back. \nINT. CESSNA - 1968 - DAY \nThe engine is on and the propeller is spinning.  Kevin is at the controls.  Tuna is not making the trip.  He pokes his head in before shutting the cockpit. \nTUNA You guys are fucking insane. \nGeorge reads from a flight manual. \nGEORGE Alright, pull back the throttle... \nThe engine screams. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) Not that far, only halfway.  You sure you know what you're doing? \nKEVIN Relax.  I've flown with my old man a million times.  And he always told me, the taking off part is easy, it's the landing you've got to worry about. \nEXT. SANTIAGO FARM - MEXICO - 1968 - DAY \nThe plane tries to land.  It's a clumsy one.  The Cessna is tipping and touching, first one wheel, then another, almost sideways before straightening out and stopping.  George and Kevin hop out of the plane.  They are greeted by Santiago and the Mexican contingency. \nAMIGOS Hola, George!  Bienvenido! \nGeorge hands out presents to everyone.  He's like Santa Claus, giving gifts to every man, woman and child.  They love him.  Santiago pumps George's hand. \nSANTIAGO Good to see you, Jorge.  You are a man of your word. \nGEORGE Actually, I've got some news.  That fifty thousand I promised you, I couldn't get it. \nFRED Killjoy? \nGeorge looks to Barbara, whose nose is bleeding. \nGEORGE Honey, your nose! \nBARBARA Oh my G-d, I'm so sorry. \nERMINE Barbara, here, take my napkin. \nBARBARA Thanks.

Sure.  You're right. You fly home and get some rest. \nBARBARA Nice first impression.  A nose bleed in front of your parents. \nGEORGE Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself. \nBARBARA Oh, they weren't that bad.  I mean, they were kind of cute. \nGEORGE Promise me that we'll never be like them.

Something about trying to sell a truckload of dope to an undercover officer.  So I applied the three rules of the game under if and when arrested. \nINT. COOK COUNTY COURTHOUSE - CHICAGO - 1972 - DAY \nGeorge and his COURT APPOINTED ATTORNEY stand before the JUDGE at the arraignment. \nGEORGE (V.O.) Rule one: don't fight.  A trial will cost you a fortune in lawyer's fees and the jury will chop off your balls and hand them to you on a platter. \nJUDGE George Jung, you have been accused of possession of six-hundred and sixty pounds of marijuana with intent to distribute.  How do you plead? \nGEORGE (V.O.) Rule two: plead not guilty and get bailed out of jail. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) Your honor, I'd like to say a few words to the court. \nThe court appointed attorney puts his head in his hands. \nJUDGE By all means. \nGEORGE In all honesty, I don't feel like what I've done is a crime and I think it's illogical and irresponsible for you to sentence me to prison.  None of the real criminals of the world ever end up behind bars.  I mean, when you think about it, what did I really do?  Cross an imaginary line with a bunch of plants?  You say that I'm an outlaw, you say that I'm a thief, but where's the Christmas dinner for the people on relief? \nGeorge stops when his attorney stamps on his foot.  The court officers roll their eyes and the judge smiles. \nJUDGE Those are very interesting concepts you have, Mr. Jung. Unfortunately for you, the imaginary line you crossed is real, the plants you brought with you are illegal, and what you did constitutes a crime. \nThe judge slams his gavel. \nJUDGE (CONT'D) Bail is set at twenty-thousand dollars. \nEXT. COOK COUNTY COURTHOUSE - CHICAGO - 1972 - NIGHT \nGeorge walks out, free on bond, to find Barbara waiting for him.  She doesn't look so good. \nBARBARA Surprise. \nINT.

You really loved her. \nGEORGE Yeah, Dad.  I really did.  What am I gonna do? \nFRED Tough spot. \nThe glasses are refilled. \nGEORGE You mad at me? \nFRED Not mad. \nGEORGE Yeah, you are.  I can tell by the way you look at me. \nFRED I just don't know what you're thinking. I don't understand your choices.  You know, the police are looking for you. \nGEORGE I know.  I'm great at what I do, Dad.  I mean, I'm really great. \nFRED Let me tell you something, son.  You would have been great at anything. \nSomething outside catches George's eye.  A light.  A reflection.  A movement.  George is up and on the move. \nFRED (CONT'D) Where are you going? \nEXT. JUNG HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe front door opens and FEDERAL AGENTS pour into the house. \nINT. JUNG HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nGeorge is up the stairs in a flash. \nERMINE George! \nINT. GEORGE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nGeorge slams the door behind him, moves over to the window, and opens it.  Cops everywhere.  He's trapped.  Out of options, he folds.  He moves to the corner and sits down, turns on the train set.  A KNOCK on the door is heard.  FBI Agent, JAMES T. TROUT. \nTROUT George Jung, you are under arrest. \nFRED Open the door, son. \nEXT. JUNG HOUSE - LATER \nThey lead George outside in handcuffs.  Ermine and Fred watch. \nERMINE I had no choice. \nGeorge stops and looks at his mother, for the first time realizing her betrayal. \nERMINE (CONT'D) Don't look at me like that.  What was I supposed to do?  You're in our house. What, was I supposed to be an accomplice? \nAs George is led to the police car, Ermine follows. \nERMINE (CONT'D) You don't think people know you're a drug dealer?  Everyone knows.  It's no secret.  How do you think that reflects on me?  Every time I go out, I'm humiliated.  I see the stares.  I hear the whispers.  How do you think that makes me feel?  Did you ever once stop and think of me? \nGeorge's head is pushed down as he is put in the squad car. He looks up at his mother. \nERMINE (CONT'D) So you go to jail.  It's for your own good.  You need to straighten your life out. \nINT. DANBURY F.C.I. - 1974 - DAY \nSUPERIMPOSE: \nGeorge is being led through a series of gated corridors. \nGUARD Prisoner in. \nAs he walks, he takes in the faces of the other inmates.  He arrives at his cell and notices he has a ROOMMATE. \nGUARD (CONT'D) Prisoner in. \nINMATE #1 Shit, I'm in for life. \nINMATE #2 I'm a criminal.  I ain't getting no motherfucking job. \nGEORGE We can learn some criminal shit, too. Alright, I'll make you a deal.  What if half the time, we learn about George Washington, and the other half, I'll teach you how to smuggle drugs? \nINMATE #2 Man, you don't know dick about smuggling no drugs. \nGEORGE I was arrested in Chicago with six hundred and sixty pounds of grass.  I think that qualifies me. \nDiego looks up from his desk, suddenly very interested. \nINMATE #1 How did you get a hold of six-hundred and sixty pounds of dope? \nGEORGE Flew it in from Mexico on a single engine Cessna.  Now, do we have a deal or not? \nThey react.  They're in. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) Alright, the first thing you need to know about smuggling drugs is that it's easy.  The DEA are a bunch of losers. They couldn't find their dicks in a whorehouse.  They don't know what the fuck they're doing... \nDiego watches George winning over the room.  He listens intently to George's every word.  His wheels are turning. \nINT. DANBURY F.C.I. - GEORGE'S CELL - NIGHT \nLights out.  Diego and George lay in their cots.  George is tired.  Diego is not. \nDIEGO George?  Hey, George?  I listen to what you say to the class today about the smuggling.  You are a magico, ah? \nGeorge doesn't respond. \nDIEGO (CONT'D) I never believed you were a murderer.  I knew.  I knew you are a magico.  I have seen it in you.  It's in your spirit. \nGEORGE I'm tired, Diego.  Go to bed. \nDIEGO You like to make the boundaries disappear.  It's not only the money, is it, George?  The adventure is part of the victory.  It's the thrill, ah? \nGEORGE Good night. \nDIEGO In my country, I am a magico.  A man with a dream.  A man on the rise.  To take nothing and make it something, okay?  I have failed my dream, but I will accomplish.  That is why I am in your country.  Yes, I lose my freedom. But they do not take my dream.  Do you have a dream, George? \nGEORGE I would if I could get some sleep. \nDIEGO Yes, you have a dream.  And maybe you accomplish your dream.  But yet you failed.  Why? \nGEORGE Because I got caught. \nDIEGO No, my brother. \nGEORGE Because they caught me? \nDIEGO You failed because you had the wrong dream. \nDiego climbs off his bunk and looks George square in the eye. \nDIEGO (CONT'D) George?  What do you know about cocaine? \nINT. DANBURY F.C.I. - MESS HALL - DAY \nGEORGE I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good thing going already.  Everybody smokes pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich man's drug.  It's too expensive. \nDIEGO No, no.  That is where you are wrong. For us, it is cheap.  In Medellin, we buy for six-thousand dollars a kilo.  IN Miami, we sell for sixty. \nGeorge's interest is piqued. \nGEORGE That's over fifty-thousand dollars profit per kilo. \nDIEGO And that's wholesale.  Cut it a few times and retail, you're looking at two, three-hundred thousand. \nGEORGE Oh my G-d. \nDIEGO Yes.  And a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana. Everything is the same, George, except instead of thousands, you are making millions. \nGEORGE Jesus Christ.  Jesus fucking Christ. \nDIEGO Now do you see what I am saying? \nGEORGE Getting it here is no problem.  Trust me.  I'll fly it in myself if I have to. What about supply?  How much can we get? \nDIEGO Don't worry.  We will talk of everything.  We have the time.  You arrive here with a Bachelor of Marijuana, but you will leave with a Doctorate of Cocaine. \nINT. DANBURY F.C.I. - GEORGE'S CELL - NIGHT \nDIEGO (CONT'D) This is only part of the business, George.  A very small part.  Don't worry, there is so much more to do. Which reminds me, I need a favor from you.  I must go to Colombia. \nGEORGE What is it, George?  Because I have to get home.  I've got a parole officer waiting for me. \nDIEGO I need you to go to Miami. \nEXT. VENETIAN KING APTS. - MIAMI - 1977 - DAY \nGeorge gets out of a taxi to find SEVERAL COLOMBIAN MEN hanging around outside an apartment.  He checks the address and moves over to the men. \nGEORGE I'm George.  Friend of Diego's? \nThe Colombian men are not impressed.  They grab George and pull him inside. \nINT. VENETIAN KING APTS. - CONTINUOUS \nGeorge is pinned against the wall and the Colombian men all start screaming at him in Spanish.  There seems to be a problem.  A man, ALESSANDRO, steps forward.  He is the one who speaks English. \nALESSANDRO QUIET!  Callate!  Where's Diego? \nGEORGE I don't know.  He sent me.  I'm George. \nALESSANDRO Oh, I see.  George.  Well, that explains everything.  Open your mouth, George. \nGeorge's puzzled look is replaced by a gun barrel in his face.  Alessandro presses it against George's front teeth. \nALESSANDRO (CONT'D) Now, you listen to me.  Are you hearing me? \nGeorge nods. \nALESSANDRO (CONT'D) You see this? \nHe indicates two duffel bags stuffed with fifty kilos of cocaine. \nALESSANDRO (CONT'D) I've been holding this shit for him for three weeks.  You tell Diego I don't appreciate it.  You tell him I want my money by Friday.  Can you do that? \nGEORGE Um-hmm. \nINT. JUNG HOUSE - GEORGE'S ROOM - DAY \nGeorge sits on his bed, reading.  Two duffel bags are tucked away in the closet.  Ermine pokes her head in. \nERMINE You have a phone call. \nGeorge picks up the phone. \nDIEGO (O.S.) George. \nGEORGE Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you? It's been eleven days and these guys want their fucking money. \nDIEGO (O.S.) Bad news, George.  I'm in Colombia. \nGEORGE Well, you better get here fast.  I'm sitting on... \nGeorge notices Ermine is loitering in the hallway, eavesdropping. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) Hi, Mom. \nGeorge acknowledges her before shutting the door in her face. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) I'm sitting on fifty fucking keys.  Get your ass up here. \nINT. CARCEL DE VARONES - MEDELLIN, COLOMBIA - CONTINUOUS \nIt's a South American prison.  Diego is on the pay phone. \nDIEGO It's a little hard to get away right now.  I'm afraid you're on your own. \nINT. FOREAL'S HOUSE - MANHATTAN BEACH - 1977 - NIGHT \nGeorge and Derek sit in the living room with MR. T, a hippie ish looking professor.  On the table sits various paraphernalia.  Scales, beakers, test tubes, and a hot box. George and Derek watch as Mr. T scoops some of George's cocaine and sets it onto the two-inch metal plate. \nMR. T What we're doing is measuring the purity.  Pure coke melts out a hundred and eighty-five, a hundred and ninety degrees.  Cutting agents melt much lower.  About a hundred degrees. Quality product starts melting at a hundred and forty degrees.  That's what I'm hoping for. \nMr. T turns the dial.  120.  130.  140. \nMR. T (CONT'D) Good. \nMR. T (CONT'D) Jesus Christ. \nMR. T (CONT'D) Holy fucking Mary!  Jesus, fuck me running!  Where did you get this shit! \nLARGE COLOMBIAN MAN No mistake.  Mr. Escobar will see Mr. Jung alone.  You are to wait here. \nGeorge hesitates. \nDIEGO It's alright, George.  You go. \nLARGE COLOMBIAN MAN This way, please. \nThe large Colombian man escorts George towards the area where the maleton was just shot.  George looks back at Diego as he is led away. \nESCOBAR So, this is the man who takes fifty kilos and makes them disappear in one day? \nGEORGE Actually, it was three. \nESCOBAR The man who gives us the airplanes.  The man from America.  The mafia.  Chicago. Boom boom.  Hollywood.  You are going to open for us the gates of Hollywood, George? \nGEORGE It would be my pleasure. \nESCOBAR Good.  Very good.  Welcome, my friend. Welcome to my country. \nEscobar moves over to embrace George.  George returns it, and their hands come together.  George can't help it.  He reflexively looks at his hands.  Escobar understands. \nESCOBAR (CONT'D) The man in the garden.  He was full of courage. \nGEORGE Un sapo? \nESCOBAR Un rata - no good.  But he could have run, fled the country.  Gone to the policia.  But then his wife, his children, his parents, his friends, many people would die. \nGEORGE Yes. \nESCOBAR But, never mind.  I am thinking we can do much together.  This problem with Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very silly business.  To release him from the carcel, it causes me much inconvenience. The fifty kilos could have been a big problem.  And I don't like problems. \nGEORGE With all respect, Padrino.  Diego is my partner.  I do not do business without him. \nEscobar looks at him with a cold stare.  But George doesn't flinch.  His face reveals nothing.  Finally, a smile breaks across Pablo's lips. \nESCOBAR I like you, George.  You are loyal. That is good.  That is rare.  Maybe crazy.  Yes.  I can tell already.  You are like me.  I look at you and I see myself.  It's in the eyes, no, George? \nGEORGE Yes, it is. \nESCOBAR So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country, George? \nGEORGE Yes, sir.  As much as you can give me. \nESCOBAR As much as I can give you?  Ha ha.  Very good.  I like that.  Come, George.  Let us drive.  We have much to talk about. \nDiego watches the two men walk outside.  Escobar throws an arm around George's shoulder.  Pablo hops into a Jeep and motions for George.  The bodyguards come running.  But Pablo waves them away. \nEXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - COLOMBIA - DAY \nEscobar pulls the Jeep off the road and parks it.  Before them is a stunning panorama. \nESCOBAR I like to come up here.  To make the decisions.  To be one with nature. \nGEORGE It's beautiful. \nESCOBAR People tell me that I am crazy.  That my business will never work in your country.  What do you think, George? \nEscobar looks out over the vista, allowing George the time to respond in full. \nGEORGE What do I think?  I don't want my answer to be influenced by what I want, so I'm going to have to say I don't know. \nESCOBAR Yes.  I do not know, either.  What do you want, George? \nGEORGE I want money. \nESCOBAR Yes.  Money.  Which is what, George? \nGEORGE Freedom. \nESCOBAR Power? \nGEORGE Yeah, maybe. \nESCOBAR Family. \nGEORGE Sure. \nESCOBAR Beautiful girls? \nGEORGE Keep them coming. \nGEORGE We've got to do something about this. \nINT.

It's either here or someplace else.  We've got to put it somewhere. Unless you want to launder it. \nGEORGE And keep only forty-percent?  No thanks. \nDIEGO Then relax.  It's a federal bank. Guaranteed by the government.  And Senor Noriega has very lenient banking principles.  No questions.  No problems. All the pesados keep their money here. Even El Padrino.  What do you worry? Everyone knows we are with Escobar.  Who is going to fuck with us? \nINT. BANCO DE FEDERALE - PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - DAY \nGeorge and Diego sign papers.

All the pomp and circumstance Colombian money can buy.  Politicians.  Policemen.  And every smuggler north of Colombia.  George sits with Diego and Inez at the table of honor.  Inez is opening presents.  Diego's tipsiness is a little out of character, but hey, it's his wedding day and a little champagne never hurt anyone.  He drunkenly throws his arm around George's shoulder. \nDIEGO I'm married, George.  Me.  I can't believe it.  Can you believe I'm married, George? \nGEORGE You're a lucky man, Diego. \nDIEGO I love you, my brother, do you know that? \nGEORGE I love you too, man. \nGeorge notices MIRTHA showing teeth across the room. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) I'll be right back, Diego. \nINEZ Look, honey, a power boat. \nDIEGO Great, baby, great! \nThey kiss.  George walks across the dance floor directly towards Mirtha. \nGEORGE Hello. \nMIRTHA Hello. \nGEORGE Do I know you? \nMIRTHA I don't think so. \nGEORGE Why are you smiling? \nMIRTHA Why are you smiling? \nGEORGE I don't know.  My name is George. \nMIRTHA I know who you are, El Americano.

I quit smoking, didn't I? \nGEORGE Put that shit away, they're here. \nINT. EASTHAM HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS - LATER \nMirtha and George lead Fred and Ermine from room to room, showing off the house.  The decor is, well, eclectic.  It doesn't match the architecture. \nERMINE It's all so beautiful. \nMIRTHA What do you think, Dad? \nFRED Yeah.  Nice. \nERMINE Look at this credenza.  If you don't mind me asking, how much is something like that?  It's got to cost a fortune. \nGEORGE (quickly) It's a family heirloom. \nERMINE I've seen those in magazines.  They're not cheap. \nGEORGE Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family. \nERMINE Oh, I see. \nMIRTHA Come on.  I'll show you the rest of the house. \nGeorge and his father move outside. \nEXT. GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS \nGeorge and his father walk. \nGEORGE So, business is going good.  I've got this import/export thing going on in Miami that's been very profitable.  With my investments... \nFRED Don't bullshit me, George.  I don't see you very much, I don't want to waste the time. \nThey move along the rear of the house.  Classic cars line the driveway. \nFRED (CONT'D) You come from my body, remember?  You're my baby boy.  The same kid who would jump off a mountain if someone told him he couldn't do it.  You haven't changed much.  I know the things you do.  Not everything.  But I get the picture and I don't care.  I don't like it.  It's not what I would have chosen for you, but it's your life.  It doesn't have anything to do with me. \nHe turns and looks at his boy. \nFRED (CONT'D) You're like your mother.  You love money. \nGEORGE Dad. \nFRED No, it's good.  You have a family.  It's good if it makes you happy.  It's nice to have nice things.  Are you happy, son? \nGEORGE Yeah, Dad.  I'm happy right now. \nINT. HOLIDAY MOTEL - LITTLE HAVANA - 1978 - DAY \nDiego puts a straw in his nose and snorts a big gakker.  His eyes are wide, his pupils dilated, and a weapon sticks out of the back of his pants.  He knocks the dust off his nose before moving outside.  George is on the porch, smoking a cigarette. \nDIEGO Three years.  How long have we been in business?  Three years.  Does she get to meet your connection?  Was she good enough? \nGEORGE Shut up, Diego.  They're going to be here any minute.  I'm trying to concentrate. \nDIEGO I'm very angry with you, George.  Very angry.  You don't take me to California, but you take your bitch wife?  A woman? I understand you love her, but it was you and me who started this.  You and me. \nGEORGE What do you need my connection for, Diego?  What are you going to do with it? \nDIEGO What do I do with it?  Nothing.  It's for peace of mind.  It's for the principle. \nGeorge doesn't have time for this.  He checks the cylinders on his weapon and runs over possible scenarios in his mind. But Diego won't get off the soap box. \nGEORGE Jesus fucking Christ, Diego.  I ain't telling you.  It's just business.  Now, shut up.  You're driving me crazy. \nDIEGO I'm driving you crazy?  No.  You're driving me crazy.  We had a dream.  What happened to our dream? \nA black sedan pulls up and FIVE PUERTO RICAN MEN approach the room.  George and Diego greet them and lead them inside. It's game time.  The atmosphere is charged with danger and everyone is acutely aware of everything.  The guys sit down, their guns bulging through the inside of their suits.  The suitcases are opened.  The rules are the same.  No English. No raising voices.  No sudden movements.  George offers their leader, TONY, beers for his men, and is politely declined. The count starts.  George and Diego riff through ten thousand dollar bundles.  Diego is still acting pissy.  He's mumbling to himself, making faces, slamming the money all around.  The guys keep a close eye on him.  Diego finishes a stack, throws one of the bags on the ground.  The conversation is in Spanish unless otherwise indicated. \nTONY Algun problema? \nGEORGE No no no... no problema, amigo.  El dinero esta todo aqui. Lleves las \"llaves\" y mas tarde lo contaremos.  Okay?  No problem. \nTONY Que problema?  Nosotros esperamos. \nThe pressure is getting to one of the hoods.  His name is BENNY.  He's got a crazy eye and he seems ready to snap. George resumes the count, but Diego won't get off it. \nDIEGO (English) You embarrassed me, George.  You make me look very bad. \nAugusto lets out a big laugh. \nAUGUSTO Norman Cay is not a person.  He is an island, George.  In the Bahamas.  From what they say, it is free and it's Diego's new home. \nGEORGE What? \nAugusto throws an arm around George's shoulder. \nAUGUSTO Let us walk.  From what I understand, Diego has bought a hundred and sixty acres, a marina, a hotel, and an airstrip. \nGEORGE Motherfucker works fast. \nAUGUSTO The word is that soon he is to be king of the middle empire.  He is doing multiple runs right now and using the island as a jump-off point. \nGEORGE He what? \nAUGUSTO Yes.  Jack Stevens is already a very busy man.  Along with many others.  You shouldn't stay away so long. \nGEORGE That's impossible.  We can't be up and running.  Who's distributing? \nAugusto says nothing.  But the ball is dropping in Times Square.  10, 9, 8, 7... \nGEORGE (CONT'D) Oh, no. \nHappy New Year.  Streamers, confetti, and champagne.  George marches through the kissing guests and over to a phone.  He's steaming.  The music is up, so he has to scream. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) Hello, Derek?  This is George.  Am I wearing lipstick? I said, am I wearing lipstick?  Because when I'm getting fucked, I want to make sure my face is pretty.  You're buying directly from Diego, aren't you, you son of a bitch? \nINTERCUT \nDerek Foreal in full New Year's regalia, complete with party hat. \nDEREK I don't want to get caught in the middle of this.  That's between you and Diego. \nGeorge's face scrinches in pain. \nDEREK (CONT'D) It's nothing personal, George.  Just business. \nGEORGE Yeah.  I understand.  Just business. Right.  Fuck you. \nThe song ends, and George is left standing there screaming. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) I bring you in, and this is how you repay me?  You little homo!  Hey, Derek? Derek? \nINT.

A el solo le importa la plata. \nBlanca reaches into her purse, pulls out an ice pick folded in a piece of linen cloth, and puts it down in front of George. \nBLANCA (CONT'D) Vos lo tenes que matar, ahorita mismo. De lo contrario vas a quedar como un marica sin horror. \nFAMILY MEMBER #3 Mejor dicho vos sos un aculillado. \nFAMILY MEMBER #1 Maricon. \nBLANCA Sabes que, vos no tenes pantalones. Nadie te va a respetar.  Usa esto.  Deja solo un huequito tan pequeno, que ni sangre le va a salir a ese malparido del Diego. \nAUGUSTO Blanca, por favor. \nESCOBAR Life will take care of everybody. Diego, me, you.  It is the teacher. \nGEORGE I get it.   I'm really pissed, Pablo. You know the DEA knows about Norman's Cay.  For Chrissakes, Diego worships Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's fucked up! \nESCOBAR I'm sorry, George. \nGEORGE Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good? \nESCOBAR Of course, George.  We are beautiful. We are brothers.  Real brothers.  Not like Diego.

But something is wrong with George.  The color drains from his face.  He grabs his chest and falls over onto the floor.  The MEDICAL STAFF attends to him. \nGEORGE (V.O.) Watching my baby girl born did something to me. They talk about religious experiences, I didn't believe in religion.  But when Kristina Sunshine Jung came into this world, something in me changed.  I looked at her and I knew right then that I could never love anything but my daughter ever again.  It sounds sappy, but it was like, click, I knew what I was put on this planet for.  It was the greatest feeling I ever had followed by the worst feeling I ever had. \nNURSE He fainted. \nMIRTHA George! \nThe doctor grabs George's wrist. \nDR. BAY He's in tachycardia.

BAY I've reviewed your toxicology report three times, George.  I've never seen anything like it.  Eighteen grams. The lethal dose is a gram and a half. You should be in the Guiness Book. \nGeorge cracks a faint smile. \nDR. BAY (CONT'D) It's not funny, George.  You should be dead right now.  Absolutely.  I cannot come up with one logical explanation for why you're still breathing.  I'm not here to give you lectures, I've got no moral interest in what you do.  But, take it easy, George.  Stay with us a while.  You've got a daughter now. \nINT. EASTHAM HOUSE - DAY \nKristina is crying.  Daddy George to the rescue.  He picks her up, cuddles her.

Now.  No fucking around.  My wife and my kid on a plane tonight.  I sign when they call me safe and sound. \nDETECTIVE #1 No fucking way. \nGEORGE Fuck you, then.  I sign nothing. \nThe detectives ponder. \nDETECTIVE #2 Do it. \nDetective #1 walks to the door. \nDETECTIVE #1 George?  You better get yourself a good lawyer this time.

I don't have a son anymore. \nShe disappears into the house.  The sound of a door slamming. \nFRED She's angry.  It's all over the news. \nGEORGE There's a fucking cop behind us, Mirtha. Be cool, will ya. \nMIRTHA Fuck you, George, just fucking drive. \nGEORGE Hey, why don't you just put a \"I'm doing cocaine\" sign on the car.  What is your fucking problem? \nMIRTHA My problem?  We're broke, that's my fucking problem.  And you're a fucking spy. \nGEORGE What? \nMIRTHA That's right.  Always spying, always judging.  Everyone's laughing at you, you fucking pussy.  You let Diego fuck you in the ass.  Maybe you are a fucking faggot.  You must be fucking Diego because you're not fucking me. \nMirtha grabs nuts. \nGEORGE Those are my nuts! \nGeorge tries to fend her off.  The car swerves all over the road.  It's turned into a full scale fist fight.  The red lights of Florida's finest come up behind them and George is pulled over. \nEXT. I-95 - CONTINUOUS \nMirtha leaps out of the car, teary eyed, crazed and bloodied. The policemen step from their car. \nMIRTHA He's a fugitive and a fucking cocaine dealer!  There's a kilo in his trunk right now!  Take this sorry motherfucker to jail! \nGeorge sits behind the wheel.  He knows it's over. \nINT. M.C.I.

There's someone else.  I'm sorry. \nGeorge just looks at her.  His face is stone.  But he is moved. \nMIRTHA (CONT'D) You should have taken better care of me, you know?  You've been away a long time. Four years.  Say something. \nGEORGE What do you want me to say?  I'm in prison.  You should know.  You put me here. \nMIRTHA Fuck you, George.  I knew you'd say something like that.  Always thinking about yourself. \nShe moves away and drags nine-year old Kristina into the room. Kristina yanks her arm away and they get into a heated argument.  Through the glass, George can't hear the words but it's clear that Kristina doesn't want to be here. \nGEORGE My baby.  She's so big. \nMirtha forces Kristina over to the glass and keeps showing her, prompting her to talk.  Kristina stares at George through the glass.  Cool.  Defiant.  Angry.  She picks up the phone and speaks, every word an accusation. \nKRISTINA I thought you couldn't live without your heart. \nShe drops the phone, walks away, and doesn't look back. \nINT.

OTISVILLE F.C.I. - NEW YORK - 1999 - DAY \nA vision of Fred Jung sits on the ground before his fifty-two year old son. \nGEORGE I guess I kind of lost sight of things. \"May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face, and the winds of destiny carry you aloft to dance with the stars.\"  Love, George. \nFRED That was a beautiful message. \nGEORGE I meant every word of it. \nFRED Did you know I died two weeks after you sent me that tape? \nGEORGE Yes, I do. \nPROSECUTOR Do you see him here in the courtroom? \nGEORGE Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table. \nPROSECUTOR Let the record state the witness has identified, Diego Delgado. \nThe following sound bytes are dissolved together in montage style... \nPROSECUTOR (CONT'D) Mr. Jung, can you describe the circumstances of how you began talking about cocaine with Mr. Delgado? \nGEORGE Shortly after I arrived at Danbury Federal Correctional Institute I related to Diego that the crime I was in for was smuggling marijuana. Diego told me he had high level connections in Colombia and they needed to find someone to help them transport cocaine into America... \nGEORGE (CONT'D) The first run was fifteen kilos, which we smuggled into Logan Airport in hard shelled suitcases. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) We wrapped the cocaine in kitchen cabinet paper, and duct tape, that way if there were any dogs in customs... \nGEORGE (CONT'D) I introduced Diego to a pilot named Jack Stevens, who helped us fly 300 kilos of cocaine per week into the United States via twin-engine Cessnas.  Jack would fly into North Carolina, we'd meet him there and drive it down to different distribution points... \nGEORGE (CONT'D) I never met Pablo Escobar.  Diego Delgado was my only connection to cocaine from Colombia... \nGEORGE (CONT'D) Diego convinced me to keep most of my money in a Panamanian bank.  Diego had a close relationship with Manuel Noriega. In exchange for allowing us to keep our money there, we paid him a percentage. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) There was an 85% chance that if you snorted cocaine between 1977-1984, it was ours. Initially with my LA connections, we invented the marketplace.  In 1977, there was no other real competition. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) The first year we made about 100 million dollars between us.  It was an expensive operation.  Eventually we built up to three different pilots doing multiple runs per week, connections on both coasts, everything was running smooth. We were like a corporation... \nGEORGE (CONT'D) he was very anti-government.  He talked about revolution, forming his own country or island, he was looking for power as well as money.

He hoped that by flooding the country with cocaine, it would disrupt the political system and tear down the morality of the country. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) Well, yes, Derek Foreal was my connection, I met him back in 1968 when I first moved to Manhattan Beach.  It was Foreal's marijuana connections that kicked off our cocaine market. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) Yes, it was my idea to bring the kilos to Los Angeles.

Are you getting paid, Mr. Jung? \nGEORGE Excuse me? \nCALIBANOS Mr. Jung, don't you have an agreement or understanding with the United States Government in connection with your testimony in this case? \nGEORGE I'm doing sixty years at Otisville, no chance of parole.  Even if they cut my sentence in half I'll be seventy-three years old.  That's some fucking deal.  I don't know if the parole board, the judge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself can get me out of here.  I have a really bad record, I'm not sure what's going to happen. \nCALIBANOS So you do have an agreement with the United States Government, Mr. Jung, correct? \nGeorge can't respond.  Looks to Diego.  Looks from the jury, the judge, George is on the spotlight and it's uncomfortable. He feels suddenly sleazy. \nCALIBANOS (CONT'D) I thought so.  No more questions. \nSilence.

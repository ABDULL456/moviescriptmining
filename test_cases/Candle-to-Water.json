{"train": "CANDLE TO WATER \nWritten by \nNick Green \nShooting draft (05/04/12) \nBLACK \nSUPER \n`Veracity' \nThen: \nBROOKE VO (phone filter) There's never been anyone like you, since you. I love you Vaughn. I love you like no-one else ever has, or could. I'm not going to try to persuade you. Just follow your heart. OK? \nFADE IN ON \n1.01 INT. SALOON CAR \u00ad EVENING \nThe car is stuck in rush-hour traffic, which surrounds VAUGHN (40), as he wrestles with the hardest decision of his life. \nHe speaks into the car mobile phone kit microphone. \nVAUGHN I don't know. I mean I want you, I want to be with you. You know that. It's just . . . \nHe glances at his mobile phone in its car kit dash cradle. The display says `OFFICE'. The lights of cars outside illuminate the falling snow, which is beginning to settle on the road. \nHe waits. No response. No need for one. \nVAUGHN Can you . . . just give me twenty four hours \u00ad OK? \nBeat. The dashboard lights seem swirl around him. Stress. \nBROOKE OS (phone filter) Are you lost? You sound lost. \nVAUGHN Thought I'd try a new way home. Beat the traffic, you know. \nHe looks at the sea of cars around him sardonically. \nBROOKE OS (phone filter) A little girl fell in love with a little boy. Still falling over here! \nHer laughter sounds loud on the car phone speakers. \nVAUGHN OK \u00ad I'll call you, babe. OK? \nBeat. The dashboard lights. Snow. Rush hour. Stress. \nHis satnav sounds bizarrely loud, suddenly: \nSATNAV VOICE In point two of a mile, keep right . . . \nBROOKE (laughter, phone filter) See \u00ad even she's on my side! (beat) I love you Vaughn. Once upon a time. \nVaughn takes a deep breath, loathes the traffic outside. \nHis phone display indicates another incoming call: `Mia'. \nVAUGHN I love you too. I gotta. . . I'll call you \u00ad OK. Bye baby. \nBROOKE OS (phone filter) Another call. Is it her? \nVAUGHN (hesitant) Yes. \nBROOKE OS (phone filter) I guess you better take it. \n2|Page Vaughn looks at the incoming call display message. His finger hovers between the `accept' or `reject call' buttons. \nVAUGHN I have to go. I'll call you. . . \nBROOKE OS (phone filter) I know. I figured. \nVAUGHN What does that mean? Look you know how it is. I'll see you very soon. Always \u00ad OK? Ciao baby. \nVaughn holds a can of soup - all that's left of his dignity. \nMia puts the shopping away in the cupboards and the fridge. \nThe tension is palpable. Silence strangles them both. \nMia finishes putting things away without looking at him. \nThe last item goes in the last cupboard. Bags are stored. \nA beat. Vaughn's body is wracked by guilty tension. \nMIA (still no eye contact) You out later then darling? \nSUPER \nDon't do this to me - please? \nVaughn hides his torment and indecision as best he can. \nVAUGHN Yeah. Probably. I don't know. \nSUPER \nI don't love you anymore. \nBROOK VO Just follow your heart. OK? \nMia takes the can of soup from him and puts it away. \n5|Page MIA (eventually) Fine. \nSUPER \nDo I disgust you that much? \nMia leaves the kitchen without looking at him. \nCUT TO \n1.05 INT. SUBURBAN SEMI \u00ad DAY \nVaughn, Mia and Pip sit at the table eating lunch. \nPIP But why not? Daddy said we could. Daddy? \nVaughn reacts half-heartedly but lovingly to Pip. Mia pretends everything is fine: the stiffness of her body and the smile. \nVAUGHN I'm not sure sweetheart. \nBROOK VO (seductive whisper) You promised. \nVaughn looks at Pip's hands. Innocence. The stony road ahead. \nMIA Daddy's not feeling too well, darling. I'm sure a swim will do us all good. \nThe lack of eye contact with Vaughn speaks volumes. \nPIP Daddy? Please? Mia said you'd. . . \nMia chastises Pip. \nMIA Mummy. It's mummy! Who's Mia!? \nPIP Mamma Mia! \nVaughn manages to smile. He wants to throw up. \n6|Page VAUGHN Sure thing, nitwit. Let's give it half an hour to let our lunch go down. I'm fine. \nSUPER \nDaddy you are a lying piece of shit. \n1.06 INT. SUBURBAN SEMI \u00ad DAY \nBROOKE My lord. \nShe smiles her love. He accepts it. He wants it \u00ad all of it. \nShe puts the kettle on. A beat of silence. \nBROOKE What you did . . . I mean I appreciate what you've done for me \u00ad for us. All I can tell you is that it will be worth it. We're meant to be together, V. You've always said that. \nHis mobile phone bleeps a text message. He ignores it. \nVAUGHN Come on. You don't owe me anything. I made a choice. \nHe grabs her, kisses her. He looks like a man trying to convince himself that if he ignores it, reality will go away. \nEmotion overwhelms her, so she gets busy with the tea. Vaughn looks around again, and out of the window. A cheap view, too. \nBROOKE I've been waiting to show you. \nShe smiles again. Taking her cue, he looks at the portrait photography on the walls in the living room. It's brilliant. \nVAUGHN My God, Brooke. It's . . . \nHe is lost for words. \n9|Page BROOKE You want to grab a shower. We should go out and celebrate. \nShe does another little dance of joy. \nVAUGHN You're telling me I stink. Mea culpa! \nBROOKE No! \nShe screams a little, laughs a lot. She buries her nose in his armpits \u00ad or tries to. They play-fight and kiss. The kiss develops into more. She wants him. They are lost in each other until Vaughn slows them down, pulls back slightly, gently. \nVAUGHN I'll take a shower. \nBROOKE I'll show you. Might even watch you. A man in my shower. The little boy a little girl fell in love with. Once upon a time. \nVAUGHN (the boy inside) He's still in there somewhere. \nBROOKE And now . . . \nThe kettle boils. It doesn't turn itself off. They hold each other's eyes. The kettle over boils. The thing between them builds and builds until she suddenly laughs and turns the kettle off. He indicates upstairs, and then exits upstairs. \nShe watches him go. Her excitement is obvious. If she senses that something is wrong, there is no outward sign of it. \n1.13 INSERT \nIMAGES: Brooke being attacked by a knife wielding lover; Brooke curled in a bloody ball, weeping; Brooke the 5 year old child playing with a 7 year old boy in long lost sunshine. \nCUT TO \n10 | P a g e 1.14 INT. CHEAP FLAT \u00ad HALLWAY - NIGHT \nDusting snow off them, Vaughn and Brooke come through the front door, which Brooke closes behind them. They're drunk, laughing, and sexual. Snow falling is visible outside. \n1.15 LATER INT. CHEAP FLAT \u00ad BEDROOM - NIGHT \nVaughn and Brooke fall onto her bed. They undress each other. The momentum builds until knife scars on Brooke's body are revealed. He sees them. She turns the light off, tries to hide them. She tries to make light of it but she's ashamed of them. \nThe momentum of their desire founders, and stops. \nBROOKE (eventually) I'm so sorry. \nSUPER \nAccept me - I beg you. \nVAUGHN (hushing her) Don't be daft. I'm sorry. It's. . . \nSUPER \nYou're damaged. How can I want you? \nBROOKE You don't need to be. Take your time. \nSUPER \nI don't care anymore. \nBROOKE Start on Monday. It'll be good for us \u00ad we can be DINKYs. \nSUPER \nI beg you with all my life. \nVAUGHN It's great \u00ad really. \nSUPER \nForgive me \u00ad I want only that. \nBROOKE You're hungry. Thirsty? Let me get you a drink. Drink for my king. Then maybe . . . \nShe twirls a seductive finger around his tie. They kiss. \n17 | P a g e 1.29 INT. CHEAP FLAT \u00ad BEDROOM - EVENING, LATER \nVaughn and Brooke begin to make love in bed. It's better this time: their passion builds; it's going to be OK. But then \nHe begins to falter and she begins to cry. Her cry becomes a \nSCREAM \nVaughn pulls back from her, looks at her. Her terror. \nVAUGHN Tell me! For God sake . . . \nShe suddenly seems alone, naked on the bed. She tries one last time: she goes to him, touches him; but he can't respond. \nHe realises. And now her dream is over. \nVAUGHN Who did this to you? \nBROOKE Does it matter? He was jealous. He's everything you're not. Vaughn? You love me. Baby? You don't need to fear him. They're just scars. Oh God, no. Vaughn? They're just scars for God sake. This is my body! \nVaughn searches for words, but he finds only his reality. \nReaching critical emotional mass, she gets up quickly, puts the overhead light on. It seems stark and horribly bright. \nShe weeps, reveals her damaged knife SCARRED body to him. \nBROOKE Can you see properly? Can you? (of her scars) Do you like them? \n1.30 INSERT \nIMAGE: Brooke being shanked by her jealous ex-lover. \nBACK WITH \n1.31 INT. CHEAP FLAT \u00ad BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nVaughn suddenly feels as vulnerable as she looks. \n18 | P a g e VAUGHN (incredulous) Why didn't you tell me? \nBROOKE Smart question Vaughn, smart. \nHe looks at her. He sees suicide in her eyes. \nShe suddenly lunges for him, starts to punch him. To Vaughn this now has the quality of a nightmare. This is impossible. \nBROOKE Love me. \nThey struggle. She's no match for him, but he is half hearted. \nBROOKE Love me! \nHe takes it. She smashes at him. His nose and mouth bleed. \nBROOKE Love me, bastard! COWARD! \nThere is an unusually long delay before Mo responds. \nMo approaches, and stops when he reaches DOLORES. \nMO No sweat Doll. \nDOLORES Dolores! How many more times? \nBut she's smiling. There's familiarity between them. When Mo smiles, however, the smile seems out of place on his face. \nMO No worries Doll. \n21 | P a g e Mo laughs. A strange laugh. She throws him an angry face. \nDOLORES Sorry mister Caudwell. Mo here will see you out. I have to . . . \nShe heads off, pulling one last face at Mo as she goes. \nCY OK (indifferent) thanks. \nCy's voice is barely audible as he rummages in boxes. \nMo looks in at him. He gets a text, checks it, and responds. \nWith a `ha!', Cy pulls something out of a box. Mo waits. As he does so, he shifts his weight from his right foot to his left. \nCy emerges from the storage area looking flushed with effort. \nCY Thanks. \nMO No sweat. \nMo goes to lock storage area 110. Cy looks at the object he has retrieved: an old VHS video cassette. Mo sees it. \nMO Wow \u00ad that's an old VHS isn't it? \nCY It is indeed. Are we done? \nCy speaks to him grudgingly. He wants to get the hell out. \nThe door locked, Mo starts to walk away from 110 with Cy. \nMO Ain't seen one of those for years. Never used one. \nCY Really. \nCy walks way ahead of Mo. The hell out of here. \nMO Wait \u00ad I gotta sign you out man. Paperwork. You got the forms? \n22 | P a g e CY Man? What the hell happened to `sir'? \nHis disgust is obvious in the way he avoids looking at Mo. \nMO Sir? You're a knight? The queen dub you or something? If I don't call you sir that doesn't mean I don't respect. It just means I don't call you sir. \nCY Fine. It doesn't really matter. Sorry. \nCy walks faster but Mo knows he doesn't know where he's going. \nMo looks more closely at him. \nMO Wait \u00ad you're that director. \nCY Can we please just finish up and go. I'm late. \nMO Seriously \u00ad I know you. I'm an actor. We met once. Maybe . . . \nCy keeps walking but doesn't know where he's going. \nCY You've got the wrong man. \nMO No seriously. We met at an audition. You auditioned me. \nCy just speeds up. \nMo lets go of Cy's hand. Cy is relieved. They walk on. \nCY (looking around for exit) How hard can this be? \nMO (as Cy speaks, above) Pros or ho's \u00ad know what I'm saying. \nMo laughs. It's a strange sound. \nMO What's on the video? None of my biz, I know; but I'm curious. \n26 | P a g e CY If you must know, it's a show- reel. An old one. \nMO Yup. Got the old bit. (looks at the VHS. Old) Wow. (laughs) Ain't you got one online? Mine's online. \nThey round a corner. Cy twigs they're back where they started. \nCY Right. Get us the fuck out of here or I'm going to . . . \nCy reaches for his mobile phone. He goes to dial, but Mo \nSMASHES \nit out of his hand. It hits the floor and breaks. \n2.35 EXT. STORAGE DEPOT \u00ad DAY, SAME TIME \nPeople coming and going and cars and lorries and the city skyline. Nothing out of the ordinary. The way things are. \n2.36 INT. STORAGE DEPOT \u00ad DAY, SAME TIME \nCy stares at his smashed phone, at Mo. Mo's face is a mask. \nThe mask eventually moves. Confusion hits Mo's face. It's as if another part of him did that, a part he can't control. \nMO Look sorry about that dude, but you need to let me know. That's my simple question: what happened. \nPanic starts to show itself in Cy's face. Deep down. \nCY What happened? \nMO The audition. I didn't get the job. \nMo shifts his weight from his right foot to his left. \nCy glances around, at his smashed phone on the floor. \n27 | P a g e He looks up, sees CCTV cameras. He stoops down to pick up the parts of his broken phone. He finds the SIM card, pockets it. \nThere's something pathetic about the way he stoops. \nMO (eventually) Seriously. The Silver thing. \nCy stands, meets Mo's gaze full on for the first time, really. \nCY Look I don't know. Actors \u00ad we would have seen dozens. I mean it was a long time ago. I don't know what you mean `what happened'. \nMo just looks at him. Unsettling. \nCY If you didn't get it, you didn't get it. It's the - (nervous laugh) - it's the way of the world, no? \nMo just looks at him. A door opens and closes somewhere. \nCY This is ridiculous. \nCy sets off on his own walking again. He's had enough. \nMO I know how good you are. \nCy stops, turns. What? \nMO I know your true potential. I know your talent doesn't belong packed up in here. Your greatness. And you've failed. \nCy swallows air. \nCY What are you doing? \nIt's dark, and to Cy feels like a cage. \nCY You think you can actually DO THIS?! What the fuck. . . \nCy screams `Help'. No response. \nMo looks around. He pulls up a box on one side, and sets an old chair opposite it on the other side of the caged area. \n31 | P a g e Cy throws himself at the door, heaves at it. \nCY What the fuck, sunshine. Equity subscriptions lapsing are they? \nMO Cy, seriously, man who directed nothing: let's just get this right. Then we can get on with things. You can go back your self-loathing and I can continue my rounds. \nCY What!? Screw you. (loud, to anyone again for help) FUCK YOU! \nMo smashes his fist into Cy's face. \nCY What the fuck is the matter with you? Jesus Christ! \nMO Jesus not in here, bro. Christ a nipple sucked by mugs. One born every minute, tick tock. \nMo flicks his keys around in circles. Shock grips Cy's throat. \nMO OK. So what's the brief? \nCY What? \nMO What's the scenario? Set the scene for me. Point me in the right direction. Even Brando needed goalposts. \nCy looks around for escape. A phone rings, somewhere OS. \nCY Help. HELP! \nThe phone stops ringing. A silent vastness of industrial dark. \n32 | P a g e MO No sweat, Doll. Just relax. This place is damn big. And you're talking to the big expert here. (shows Cy his shoes) Gotta do a circuit every hour. (beat) We gonna just do this thing, then it's home free. OK? Relax. \nCy tries to slow his breathing down, get a grip. \nMO That's it old fella. Get sorted out. In and out. Let it all be cool. \nCy's breathing in the dark. Mo's keys. No way out. \nCY You'll be missed. \nHe jerks his head. He means the office \u00ad colleagues. \nMO Well not really Mister De Mille. It's just me and Doll today. Cutbacks. Don't ya love them? \nCy tries the door again, but it's half-hearted. \nMO Set me straight, mister director! \nMo stands, suddenly, and comes over to Cy quickly. He grabs him by the hair and forces him to sit down on the old chair. \nMO The director's chair. \nCY What the fuck do you want? \nMO You know what I want. Just like you: another chance. Audition me again, you fucking VHS crumb. Give me my brief. Motivation, reality \u00ad the whole bit. Go. \nMo sits down opposite Cy on the box. He waits. \n33 | P a g e Cy stares at him. This is insane. But he has no choice. \nCY Do what you want, wanker. \nMo immediately gets up, starts beating him to pulp. \n2.39 INT. THE WAREHOUSE - DAY \nRow after row of caged storage areas. Industrial vastness. \nNo hint of violence. No sign of anything wrong. \nIt's agony, but eventually Cy manages to speak. \nCY You did it. You got the job. \nMo stands, smiles, basking in his moment of glory. \nThis is his prize. This is his moment. But his face darkens. \nMO LIAR! \nMo starts to beat Cy gain, but this time he kicks him too. He goes berserk, throwing Cy around like a rag doll, pulping him. \n2.46 INT. THE BOX - DAY \nDolores enters. \nDOLORES Cuppa, Mo? Mo? \nThe room is empty. She approaches Mo's desk. She doesn't even glance at the bottle of prescription pills, on which the word `suppression' is just visible. She glances at the CCTV screens. Nothing. She presses a button, bringing up the display from another CCTV. She sees the grainy, monochrome image of Cy's pulped face being smashed against the bars of 222. As she gasps in horrified reaction and grabs the phone \n37 | P a g e CUT TO \n2.47 EXT. STORAGE DEPOT \u00ad DAY, SAME TIME \nPeople coming and going and cars and lorries and the city skyline. Nothing out of the ordinary. The way things are. \nVery slowly, gradually, we \nFADE TO BLACK \n38 | P a g e Story #3 \nBLACK \nSUPER `Crackerjack' \n3.48 EXT. LONDON E3 - EVENING \nFootsteps and breathing: the SOUNDS of a young man running for his life. The staccato pounding of his feet becomes a mantra that builds until it develops a life of its own, and a surreal edge. It becomes a ghostly, dreamlike sound \u00ad evil perhaps. \nThe running footsteps suddenly stop. The breathing continues. \nJADEN VO (between breaths) Aight \u00ad am done runnin'. Do what ya gotta do. \nBeat, then \nFADE IN ON \n3.49 INT. COUNCIL HOUSE \u00ad EVENING \nAUSTEN (12) plays Skyrim on a brand new Mac PowerBook. The hi- tech, futuristic sheen of the Apple is utterly at odds with the room Austen is in: money seems to be in short supply here. \nAusten is a cut and paste hoodie: a white boy going nowhere. \nJADEN (18, white) enters. Lean and strong, Jaden is savvy \u00ad but drugs have left their mark on his face and in his eyes. \nJADEN What the fuck, my fam . . . \nHe grabs the Mac from Austen. They push and pull for it. \nAUSTEN No way! Fuck off now, brah! \nJaden whacks Austen around the head \u00ad light, but hard enough to break his grip. Jaden puts the computer to one side; the way he handles it suggests that replacing it would be a synch. \nAusten attacks him, but Jaden restrains him. \n39 | P a g e JADEN You got homework. Do the work. \nAUSTEN Fuck that. Gimme . . ! \nAusten makes for the Mac again, but Jaden restrains him. \nThey fight a moment, but it's futile: Austen pulls back, humiliated and outraged. He kisses his teeth and birds. \nJADEN Don't be doin' that fam. It's all wrong. You ain't black yet. \nON Austen's snarl, FREEZE FRAME and \n3.52 INT. E3 COUNCIL HOUSE \u00ad EVENING \nIn the kitchen-diner: Jaden, Austen and their dad: PAUL (50s). \nPaul says a prayer before they eat their corner shop meal. \nJaden's hands are together in respect for Paul. Austen deliberately pays no attention to the ritual at all. \nPAUL . . . for this gift of daily bread we thank thee oh Lord. . . \nJaden throws Austen a look. Mean and fierce. And now suddenly we see what he's capable of. Fear overcomes Austen's arrogance. He puts his hands together and closes his eyes. \nPAUL . . . and for the gift of these fine sons I thank thee oh Lord. . . \nThe crucifix on the wall. Christ's tormented face in the cheap shadows of this dull, crappy kitchen. It's all Paul has. \nPAUL . . . beseech thee to look down on them and protect them with thy everlasting mercy . . . \nSeeing Jaden's eyes now closed in prayer for Pauls' sake \nAusten can't resist feeling the wad of new cash in his pocket. \n42 | P a g e PAUL Thanks be to God. Amen. \nThe boys join him in `Amen' \u00ad Jaden properly; Austen barely. \nThey begin to eat their corner shop meal. \nAusten sees a shadow cross Jaden's face as Jaden remembers \n3.53 INT. E3 HOUSE \u00ad NIGHT \nIn washed-out, high grain: \nJaden necks and smooches with a black girl called LYCIA. \nAround them the party pops: drugs and big bass and wannabe cool young kids getting into each other or off on each other. \nLycia smiles and laughs and love the attention, but \nA young black guy \u00ad J.C. \u00ad looks death at her, his girl, then at Jaden, who meets the challenge of the alpha competition. \nJaden feels the bulge in his belt at the base of his spine. \n3.54 INT. E3 COUNCIL HOUSE \u00ad EVENING, LATER \nThe meal over, Jaden does the dishes. Paul sits at the table. \nAusten playing Skyrim in the next room is audible. \nPaul breaks down in a fit of coughing. \nChrist watches on. \nJADEN Fuck. \nJaden suddenly leaves the sink and goes into the \n3.55 INT. LIVING ROOM - EVENING \nJaden grabs the Mac off Austen again. This time Austen cowers. \n3.56 INT. KITCHEN - EVENING \nPaul lights a cigarette. A moment's pleasure. He slips into what might be a reverie, or just exhaustion. ON PAUL, hearing this as Paul might - given his dislocated state of mind: \n43 | P a g e JADEN OS (angry) Get with the fuckin' homework, swear . . . Told ya before get on with it . . . (calmer) One life, one chance, my fam . . . I help ya, no sweat . . . (angry again) Just get with it, ya little . . . \nThe sound of a punch, perhaps. \nPaul flinches. He looks to Christ. Christ is tormented. \n3.57 INT. E3 COUNCIL HOUSE \u00ad EVENING, LATER \n49 | P a g e 3.72 EXT. E3 \u00ad NIGHT \nJaden walks the streets. Hoods look at and greet him in a different way. Respect, but this is a dead man walking. \n3.73 INT. / EXT. GOLF GTI/E3 \u00ad DAY \nJaden drives Austen, who is in his school uniform. His hands up on the wheel, the dragon tat on Jaden's arm is visible. \nTo Austen, Jaden looks a little pale, a little ill. \nThey see a cop car. Another passes them coming the other way. \nAUSTEN Five oh everywhere. Wot's poppin? \nJADEN Police. They're called police. \nAUSTEN Bacon fryin' for breakfast. \nJaden throws him a look. \nTheir shared secret dominates their every breath. \nAUSTEN Wot's poppin with the pussy, fam? \nJADEN Jesus fucking Christ. You mean how's the young lady in your life, my blood? Since when the fuck you become some kind of born again reggin? \nAUSTEN I wonder if you should mind you language in front of your baby brah, blood. \nJADEN I say blood, you say blood. I say brah, you say brah. I say. . . \nAUSTEN Potato, potarto, tomato, tomarto. \nThey drive a while. Then Jaden sees that Austen's hair 100% exactly matches his own in terms of its length and styling. \n50 | P a g e JADEN You get your hair cut? \nAUSTEN And? \nThey approach the school. \nAusten glances at Jaden's torso and then gets out of the car. \nJADEN Brah? You turn into me and I'll kill you - hear? \nAusten looks at him. Tears well up in his eyes. He nods. \nEmotionless, Jaden closes the car door and drives off. \nOn the pavement, Austen watches him go. \n3.74 INT. E3 COUNCIL HOUSE \u00ad NIGHT \nBy torchlight under his duvet, Austen draws a `tat' on his forearm with a biro that matches Jaden's real tat perfectly. \n3.75 INT. JADEN'S ROOM - NIGHT \nSmoking a bong and drinking, his headphones on and the music cranked high, Jaden fights an inner battle he can never win. \nHe looks at his gun on his bedside table. A thing of new evil. \nSeptic, the wound in his torso is draining him of life. \n3.76 INT. CHURCH \u00ad DAY \nJaden and Austen kneel beside Paul in prayer. Except that Jaden only kneels on one knee and Austen on neither; and neither of them are really praying. Beside them Paul prays with worshipers in the congregation of a dozen or so. \nJaden's hoodie hood is down out of respect. Austen has his hoodie hood up. Jaden pulls it down. Austen throws him a look, kisses his tongue. Jaden's eyes darken. Austen relents. \nJaden looks over, sees a man who seems wrong in here. He twigs: plain clothes COP. Cops don't pray and this one is. \n51 | P a g e 3.77 EXT. E3 \u00ad NIGHT \nJaden sprints flat out through the people, cars, and lights. At this speed his footsteps are barely a fluttering staccato. \nHe won't make it. \nHe makes a gun of his hand and shoots himself in the mirror. \nCool. \n3.87 EXT. LYLE PARK, CANNING TOWN, LONDON \u00ad EVENING \nFugitive Jaden stands looking into the flowing river. He is pale and gaunt and dirty. Austen stands behind him. He looks exactly how Jaden used to look. And his torso is bandaged. \nJaden squints at him. \nJADEN Why you fuckin' grass me up. Though you was my brah. \nAusten thinks about it for a while. \nAUSTEN I didn't tell the pigs. Just (falters, then) . . . just Hugo up school. \nTraffic SOUNDS ebb and die. History flows down to the sea. \nAUSTEN Told because I was proud of ya brah. Massive proud. \nJaden looks at him. Proud of him? Fuck. \nAUSTEN Couldn't help it. \nJaden has to hold on to the railings now. \nAUSTEN What the pigs gonna do with ya? \n54 | P a g e Jaden looks around him. Darkness is falling. \nAusten produces a gun from the base of his spine. His gun. \nJADEN Where the fuck . . ? \nHe stares at Austen's gun. Tears blur the evening. \nHe says it with his tears. This isn't going to happen to you. \nAUSTEN Only way you're gonna stop me turning into you is by killing me, brah. Long one short. \nAusten holds his arms out as if to say `this is what I am'. \nJaden reaches for the base of his spine. \nAusten stands there waiting for Jaden's bullet. \nJaden takes his hand away from his gun. \nJaden mumbles something inaudible. \nAUSTEN Say what brah? Too much . . . \nHe indicates his ears, that wanking makes you deaf, laughs. \nJADEN (a mumble) Said go home. Fix dad's tea. I'll be there soon as. OK? \n3.88 EXT. ROYAL VICTORIA DOCK \u00ad NIGHT, LATER \nJaden stands there alone. It's getting cold. \nAUSTEN VO (Jaden's memory) Only way you're gonna stop me turning into you is by killing me, brah. \nJADEN Got a better idea, baby blood. \nJaden pulls out his gun and shoots himself in the head. Dead. \n55 | P a g e 3.89 INT. E3 COUNCIL HOUSE \u00ad EVENING \nIn the kitchen-diner: Austen and Paul at the table. \nPaul says a prayer before they eat their corner shop meal. \nAusten's hands are together in respect for Paul. \nBut Paul can't speak. Austen sees his tears, which escape from behind the barrier of his cracked hands like eager jewels. \nThug#2 works Nicholas expertly, and with professional care. \nURI Alright, alright \u00ad thank you Mister Karaczun. This is . . . \nThis is getting them nowhere. Uri looks at Nicholas' pulped face \u00ad at the new damage that Thug#2 has done. Pointless. \nThug#2 stands back, waits. \n58 | P a g e Uri stands, goes to a cabinet and pulls out a set of surgical implements. He puts a pair of rubber sanitary gloves on. He lays out the implements on a metal table beside Nicholas. \nHe goes to work. \n4.93 INT. ARTIST STUDIO \u00ad DAY \nELLE (30's) draws a female nude in white pastel on black paper. The drawing is as exquisite as she is, if that's possible. Elle is the kind of woman that men will do anything for - the kind of unforgettable beauty you see very rarely. \nElle takes extreme care with the drawing. Her attention to it and involvement with it is absolute. She is alone in the studio, which contains other drawings and simple furnature. \nThe SOUNDS of Uri torturing Nicholas OVER are in extreme, hideous contrast to the beauty of Elle and her drawings. The contours of Elle's face and the fine lines and moments of shade in her drawing. The sounds of unimaginable suffering. \nFive minutes of drawing. Five minutes of Nicholas' screams. \nThen the SOUND of Uri dropping an implement and cursing. \nThe Thugs mumbling. \nCUT TO BLACK \nA heart PULSE falters, and then stops. \nAn electrocardiograph flat line SOUND. \nA beat, then \nUP ON \n4.94 INT. RESEARCH ROOM, FACILITY \u00ad DAY \nUri stands back. There is blood all over his rubber gloves and some on his apron. He looks at Nicholas, feels his pulse. \nNicholas is dead. \n4.95 INT. BOARD ROOM, FACILITY - DAY \nUri sits at a huge, polished oak business meeting table. He is now dressed in a business shirt, tie and three-piece suit. But a louche handkerchief in his breast pocket adds a touch of flare to his sombre ensemble. Uri is somewhat frustrated. \n59 | P a g e Three other suits are at the table: BOOTHY (50s), the boss, SILK (40s), #2, and PARKER (30s), #3. All but Parker are middle class and business-like. In here, PC efficiency is all. \nBOOTHY Has the next of kin been informed? \nSilk clears his throat. \nSILK Not yet sir. \nBOOTHY (inform her) There's never a good time. \nSILK Yes sir. \nSilk makes a note on his iPad. \nBoothy looks at Uri as if waiting for an explanation. \nURI Our intelligence . . . \nThe irony of that comment creates a response that emanates from Boothy and travels round the table hierarchically. \nBOOTHY As the board understood it, the prisoner was verified as the jihadi. There was DNA. . . \nURI We now believe the evidenced might have been contaminated. \nBOOTHY (not impressed) Was there any form of extraction? \nURI The suspect revealed nothing of the activities of which he was suspected by the board, sir. \nPARKER Fruit was not born. \nURI Mrs Pentane very good of you to see me like this. \nELLE Come in Mister Tallow. \nShe wants anything but this dull little man in her apartment. \nUri enters. He wipes his feet excessively, over and over. \nShe closes the door behind him. He looks around. \n68 | P a g e URI Lovely, just lovely. This is yours? Goodness. \nHe goes to a piece of art hanging on the wall. A nude. \nURI It's amazing. Such talent. Me . . . \nHe shrugs as if worthless. Elle tries to hold it together. \nELLE Can I get you anything? \nURI No \u00ad really I'm fine. Thank you. \nHe has trouble meeting her eyes. That unsettles her even more. \nURI Such platitudes! Here we are trapped inside a Terrence Rattigan three act . . . \nHe laughs. It sounds unnatural. \nWary of him in the extreme, he gestures to a seat reluctantly. \nShe sits down opposite him. Her body language is pure defence. \nURI Mrs Pentane. A delicate subject of course. Your husband. \nShe blinks. He can see the unimaginable depth of her grief. \nUri gets some correspondence out of his briefcase. \nURI Good, old fashioned paper. Nothing like it. \nHe waves the sheets of paper around. She can't even react. \nURI Firstly I'm so very sorry for your loss. I know the ministry has informed you that your husband \u00ad Mr Nicholas . . . \nShe puts her hand across her slightly swollen belly. \n69 | P a g e She's pregnant. My God. Uri frowns slightly, struggles. \nURI Misses Pentane the fact is that . . . \nShe looks at him with exhausted, beautiful eyes. \nURI The truth is Misses Pentane that . . . I'm here to tell you that . . . Well this may not be what you want to hear but . . . \nHe looks at her, looks away. He can't meet her gaze. \nELLE (get the fuck out) If you'd kindly hurry. Please. \nHer phone bleeps a message alert. An isolated sound. \nURI Misses Pentane I . . . \nHe can't speak. Why did he come here? This is impossible. \nURI Misses Pentane . . . \nELLE Oh for God sake! \nShe gets up, stands, walks away from him. He stands. \nURI The fact is that your husband did not die in the manner in which you have been told he died. As I alluded in my letter, my email. . . \nShe opens the door for him to leave. He wants to die. \nELLE I can't do this now. I'm sorry. \nHer world has become a nightmare. Nothing is real. \nURI I know this is a lot to take in, Misses Pentane. \nThe words don't seem like hers: \nELLE What are you? \nUri almost smiles. Little old me. \nAs if in a dream she looks around, searching for something. \nELLE I'm calling the police. \nURI That won't help much today. \nBut she dials. He grabs the phone from her with polite force. \nHe puts then phone down like a 5 star hotel receptionist. \n73 | P a g e ELLE What the fuck do you think. . . Get out \u00ad now! \nShe grabs the phone again and redials. He grabs the phone from her, this time with slightly more force. She is pushed away. \nELLE Fucker! GET THE FUCK OUT! \nBut he just stands near her, breathing. \nELLE What do you want from me? \nHe opens his arms slightly, looks at her. The eyes of a child. \nURI I want. I want. . . \nHe can't say it. Can't say forgiveness, can't say death. \nShe SUDDENLY grabs an ornament from the dresser near her. \nURI Wait. Wait please. \nHe drops to his knees. Gets ready. \nURI OK. \nBut she has swung and CONNECTED before he has spoken. \nHe reels from the impact, but she is weak with shock. \nELLE Piece of shit-mould. Get out. . . \nShe swings again \u00ad stronger this time. The blow hurts him. \nELLE This is what you fucking want? Fuck. . .(sobbing) Oh Jesus. . . \nShe changes. Adrenaline kicks in. She starts to pound him with the ornament, which breaks. Then she grabs a stone stature and \nHITS \nHim with it. That sends him flying. He grovels on the carpet. \n74 | P a g e ELLE Motherfucker . . . \nShe lays into him. He accepts it all. Blow after bloody blow. \nURI Yes (blow) Yes (blow) Yes (blow). \nAfter a while she slows, exhausted. \nELLE Piece of dogshit . . . \nShe grabs her belly, grimaces. Uri's face is now pulped. \nURI Misses Pentane . . . the exertion. Please . . . \nHe means her belly, her unborn child. \n77 | P a g e (cont'd) an incident that killed a close colleague of hers and resulted in Shona being pensioned, invalided out of the army. In your opinion Chris, this - the PTSD - should have been crucial to the decision not to prosecute Shona for murder, a charge you now feel should have been reduced to what: manslaughter? She didn't seem like much of an invalid in the way she dealt with Rounds did she? So for you - was this a travesty of justice? Really? \nMARLOW VO My sense of it is, Christie, as I've said, and the reason I feel I failed, really, is that the state must find a way to take responsibility. \nThe hoodie climbs over the back fence of a house. He then proceeds up the garden \u00ad again hugging the shadows for cover. \nFEMALE DJ VO But now you're considering retiring? With a future as QC certain. A Law Lord perhaps. You're regarded by many as a (laughs) legal wunderkind! \nMARLOW VO Well I don't know about that. But yes, I'm looking to move out of the legal profession now. \nFEMALE DJ VO Because of this case, specifically? As Queens Council you could help people like Shona. Lots of Shonas. \nMARLOW I know. But look. For me it's this: we send her out to Afghanistan. We tell her to kill people who resisted our invasion. (as the DJ starts to speak) But (more) \n78 | P a g e (cont'd) anyway \u00ad look: we make her an expert. A killing machine. And then war breaks our machine. So then our machine needs Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder drugs in order to function in normal life. To make a cup of tea, for God sake. (silence a beat, then) She's a broken child, Chrissie. We broke her. So then when she kills a known psychotic child molester and murderer in her home in the middle of the night \u00ad in her home - in self-defence \u00ad we, the state, we call that murder, and we throw her to the dogs. We screw her up in the name of a cause in some country some people - and lets' face it, in a part of the world not many British people know or give a damn about - and then we finish the job. We prosecute her for murder and lock her up. \nThe hoodie chooses a ground floor window. He jemmies it open. \nFEMALE DJ VO But ultimately the only alternative is that we don't have a professional, a standing army. We rely on . . . \nMARLOW VO I understand. I understand that when you sign up, you take your chances. You become an organ of the state, and if that state tells you to kill people in its name, it chooses not to call that murder. It chooses then to call you a hero \u00ad especially if you die. \nFEMALE DJ VO So these young people, the soldiers who give their lives in the defence of our liberty (more) \n79 | P a g e (cont'd) don't deserve the label hero. Is that what you're saying? \nThe hoodie climbs through the window he has jemmied open. \nMARLOW VO Nation states have always protected themselves from their own imperial absurdities. What would be left if there was no chance of glory? Why would anyone sign up? Look: in war, anywhere, people do what they can to survive. All I can say is that personally, I mean as Shona's brief, I failed to make the court see sense. For me, you know, it's like you can murder in the so called defence of the state but if you kill in the defence of yourself . . .You know it's like, I mean as Shakespeare said `if his cause be wrong, our obedience to the king wipes the crime of it out of us.' \nHis voice dissolves and fades away as we \nCUT TO \n5.114 INT. SHONA'S HOME, BEDROOM \u00ad NIGHT \nSHONA (20s, black) is awoken by a sound \u00ad the dull clunk of something giving under strain. She lifts her head up, listens. \nAnother clunk, but this followed by other sounds downstairs. \nShona is quickly out of bed, standing. She moves in a way that suggests combat training: with controlled power and assurance. \nShe is not afraid. \n5.115 INT. SHONA'S HOME, KITCHEN - NIGHT \nCALEB (20s, white) breaks in through the kitchen window. He's young and hooded. His thin face is haunted by addiction. \nCaleb climbs through the window he has just jemmied open. He stands in the kitchen a moment, listening. He hears nothing. \n80 | P a g e He starts to move quietly through the kitchen towards the \n5.116 INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nCaleb enters. He looks around, sees the usual living room stuff: a settee, some ornaments, a TV and iPod and iPod dock; a shelf bearing a few ornaments \u00ad OK, but Caleb wants more. \nWhat Caleb doesn't seem to see are the mantelpiece photos of Corporal Shona smiling with her Para mates in Afghanistan. \nCaleb turns and heads towards the door. He goes out into the \n5.117 INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT \nCaleb emerges from the living room. \nCRACK \nA fist connects with his jaw, sending him staggering. \nCRACK, CRACK \nAnother two blows \u00ad a fist and a kick. Caleb sprawls, and then manages to stand as Shona attacks him. She moves fast and with focus \u00ad a shape in the darkness moving very fast. Caleb lashes out with his right fist. He misses. She lands another two punches to his neck and face. He yells and lashes out again. This time he connects with the side of her head. She goes sprawling. He dives towards her and pounds her with his fists. \nCALEB What the fuck \u00ad easy-peasy, ho! \nShe fights him: the focussed power of a trained soldier; but he's too strong and doesn't seem to feel blows that should be causing him a lot of pain. He PUNCHES her in the head twice. \nHe looks at her, waits. She grimaces in controlled agony. \nCALEB Don't make me spell it out. You know why we in `ere `aving this. \nLosing it, he suddenly goes to her, grabs her and drags her to the settee. He throws her on it. The pain makes her wince. She muffles her scream with pride. She now knows he is psychotic. \nCALEB DON'T PLAY ME, BITCH. Where's your fuckin' gear. Everybody got gear round this green and pleasant land. \nHe points his gun at her head. She shakes her head no. \nCALEB What the fuck. You the only bitch I picked in this whole postie with no gear? Fuck. Trust Caleb to pick a soldier. \nHe glances at the photographs again, grins. \nCALEB You got that uniform still? I like a woman in uniform. \nShe just looks at him through the fog of bloody agony. \nCALEB How come you so hot, babes? You leave the central heating on all night to keep you snuggles? Nothing like a man for that. \n84 | P a g e He removes his jacket, and then the hoodie he wears beneath it. She can see his prison tats and scars on his neck. She can see the injection marks on his dirty, skinny forearms. \nCALEB Hey \u00ad what you lookin' at? Look at me. At me eyes, ho. \nShe won't meet his eyes. ON her eyes in ECU: \nThe SOUNDS of war until \nCALEB I said look at me you fuckin' . . . \nHe jabs the gun into her crotch, leans close to her. \nShe looks him in the eyes. She sees everything that's wrong. \nCALEB You know what I am \u00ad huh? You know what I am, really? (leans close, looks deep into her eyes) I'm hungry. Starved. (stands up, moves towards the door) Wot you gonna give Caleb tweet \u00ad apart from laters? \nHe grins, looks at her crotch and licks his lips. \nHer eyes are glass. She closes them to make it all go away. \nCALEB Hey \u00ad   no: none of that. You stay front   and fucking centre. On the ball.   Keep your soldier eyes on me   no matter what. Hear me? \nShe opens her eyes. The SOUNDS of war. Her war. Her hell. \nCALEB That's better, soldier soldier. Now don't be going for no walkies \u00ad `kay? \nBacking towards the door he looks and points his gun at her. \nCALEB Not a muscle, ho. You stay like a good doggie \u00ad period. \n85 | P a g e He doesn't trust her, but he's going to take a chance. \nHe heads out of the room quickly and goes into the \n5.118 INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nCaleb goes through cupboards - fast. \nCALEB Not a move, babes. I'm watching. (searches cupboards) Where you keep the cake, ho? Me and Victoria sponge, we're tight as a schoolgirl's twat. \nGoing from cupboard to cupboard, he sees the usual food and crockery etc. In one cupboard he sees bottle of prescription pills: benzodiazepine, diazepam, and methylphenidate. \nCALEB (a low whistle) And I thought I was fucked up. What they do to you out there, babes? Turn you into a raghead? \nHe grabs a bottle of benzodiazepine and goes back into the \n5.119 INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nReading the bottle label he doesn't notice that she has gone for a brief moment. But when he does, he throws the bottle aside and starts moving. He runs out of the room and heads \n5.120 INT. UPSTAIRS - NIGHT \nCaleb runs up the stairs onto the landing, his gun up. \nCALEB Hey \u00ad fuck, bitch. Hey! \nHe aims the gun at her head again, sure and steady. \nCALEB Your choice, bitch. \nShe stops smiling. \nSHONA Wrong. \nShe drops her guard, stands very still, waiting. The bleeding gunshot wound in her shoulder is draining the life from her. \nThey look at each other a moment, breathing hard. \nShe looks away from him, disgusted. \n88 | P a g e CALEB That's what I thought. (beat) OK. So now what we gonna do is you gonna make me a sarnie. Go. (she doesn't move) Go! \nShe holds his eyes defiantly, and then she moves. \n5.124 INT. KITCHEN \u00ad LATER, NIGHT \nCaleb eats a cheese sandwich. His gun is on the kitchen table near his right hand. Shona sits opposite him; she's in bad shape: he shoulder wound is pulling her down fast. She holds a kitchen towel against it, which is SOAKED in dark red blood. \nCaleb watches her. \nCALEB Solider girl needs a hospital. \nHe eats a while. She won't even look at him. \nCALEB So what's with all the shit? (indicates the cupboard with the drugs in it) They fuck you up in ragland or something? Wonder why you can't lead a normal fuckin' life? Wankers. You do what they tell ya an' you're all cool, babes. Do what you wanna do an' you're . . . (pulls his finger across his throat) You decorated and all that? I should be scared. (laughs) If you just knew what Caleb has done. Bad things, babes, worse than bad. Then you'd be scared, trust. \nHe eats, watches her, and waits. \nSHONA What do you want? \nCALEB What you think I fuckin' want? A teensy weensy respect would be nice. Failing that, this sarnie is really rather nice, ta. \n89 | P a g e He eats, watches her, and waits. She's bleeding to death. \nShe closes her eyes. \nON Shona: SOUNDS of an explosion, shouting, and Shona screaming `Sandy!' followed by automatic weapons firing. \nThis BUILDS until Shona's eyes suddenly OPEN. \nSHONA (strangely calm) I need a doctor. \nHe breaks down in a fit of laughter. \nCALEB She needs a doctor. Well you might yet, babes. We not done partying yet. Then maybe you need a doctor. First. . . \nHe finishes the sandwich, wipes his hands on the chair. \nHe looks at her body. \nCALEB First I'm going to see what's what (indicates the house, her possession). Then we gonna see what's what (looks at her body suggestively). Ain't never done black, but there's always a first time \u00ad no? Say there's no goin' back. That right? \nHe laughs again, and then suddenly goes very serious. \nCALEB You wan' it first, or you wanna sit tight while I go foray, then we get acquainted? \nShe fights for control. She's losing the battle. \nCaleb suddenly stands, pushing the chair back. The sudden SOUND of the chair scraping on the floor makes her start. \nCALEB Oh for fuck's sake. \nHe goes to the medicine cupboard, gets her drugs out. \n90 | P a g e CALEB What do ya need? \nHe grabs various drugs and dumps them on the table in front of her. Then fills a glass with tap water and gives her that. \nCALEB Get fixed up, babes, I ain't got all night. \nShe doesn't move. \n", "test1_input": "I will do anything. \nShe steps back, does a `ta-dah!' and gestures towards the \n1.21 INT. CHEAP FLAT - KITCHEN \nBrooke leads him in by the hand. A new suit, some new shirts, new business and casual shoes, and some men's accessories lie on the kitchen table.

She misses her man! \nELLE Hello. (then, disappointed) Yes. (then, with dread) Yes. \nBOOTHY VO We actually tried Corfu this year. Not bad \u00ad though it could have been warmer. \nElle listens to the caring sharing voice on the phone. \n64 | P a g e She listens, then puts her hand to her mouth. Her beautiful eyes cloud with tears. She starts to buckle and sway. Then she collapses. There's a certain grace to the way she does it. \nSILK VO I can actually recommend Crete at this time of year. A bit populous, but there are places where one can escape the hordes. \nElle drops the phone. \n4.99 INT. BOARD ROOM, FACILITY - CONTINUOUS \nBoothy and Parker laugh at/with Silk. Uri's face is stone. \nBOOTHY Oh Lord, Michael; if we left it to you we'll all be holidaying on the Norfolk Broads! \nSilk pulls a `well actually' face. There is some laughter until Boothy stops laughing and re-focusses on their agenda. Boothy reads from his laptop again, then removes his glasses. \nBOOTHY What we're left with is something of a mess. I'm sure you agree. \nHe looks at Uri and waits. The others do the same. \nURI Sorry sir I don't suppose we could get some . . . I'm . . . \nUri makes a thirsty gesture. Mildly irritated, Boothy presses a button on an intercom. It buzzes the other end, then \nBOOTHY (into the intercom) Sharon could we get some more coffee please. (to the others) Biscuits? (the others nod except Uri) And some biscuits. The usual. Actually if there are any chocolate digestives. \nSHARON OS (on the intercom) Certainly sir. \n65 | P a g e BOOTHY (into the intercom) Thanks Sharon. \nBoothy scratches his head, refocuses. Uri waits. \n4.100 INT. COUNTRY HOME \u00ad DAY \nDressed like an accountant, Uri writes on his desktop. \nURI My desire to meet with you arises from a strong urge to inform you of the circumstances under which your husband actually passed away. The fact is, Mrs Pentane, that you have certainly been misinformed. \nUri looks up, out of the window. He looks at his hands. They seem so ordinary, so dull, and so average. He drinks more JD. \n4.101 INT. BOARD ROOM, FACILITY - DAY \nUri accepts the coffee Sharon pours for them all. She puts a plate of digestives down on the table and leaves the room. \nBOOTHY Thanks Sharon. \nSharon smiles a response. She closes the door behind her. \n", "test3_true": "PARKER (mouth full) Never can resist the bloody things. \nBOOTHY (to Parker) Make yourself at home, minister. \nBoothy and Silk grab a biscuit. \nUri sips his coffee. He REACTS. \nThe coffee is scalding. He has SCALDED his tongue. \nURI Bloody hell! \n66 | P a g e SMASH CUT TO \n4.102 INT. FACILITY \u00ad DAY (FLASHBACK) \nIn the last moments of his life, Nicholas screams and writhes under the onslaught of agony delivered by Uri with his surgical instruments. Nicholas is a pulped mess of blood. \n4.103 INT. ELLE'S APARTMENT \u00ad NIGHT \nElle's face is contorted by grief. She is curled in the foetal position on the floor. She weeps desperately. She staggers to her feet. She goes to a built-in wardrobe. She opens his side of it. His suits and shirts hang in quiet rows. She presses into them, embraces them, sobbing and screaming her agony. \n4.104 INT. COUNTRY HOME \u00ad DAY \nUri thinks a moment and then click `Send' with his mouse. \nHe takes a deep breath. \n4.105 EXT. ELLE'S APARTMENT \u00ad DAY \nUri gets out of the taxi and pays the driver. \nHe then turns to face the address. He tries to move naturally, but his body is stiff with misgiving. He takes a breath to try to calm himself. He manages to walk to the front of the apartment block. He starts to walk up the steps to the front door; but then he retreats. He steps backwards, then begins to walk away. He can't do it. His hands are shaking. He makes fists to stop them. He takes another breath, looks up at the apartment block. He is sick with stress. He forces his limbs to obey him. He manages to walk back to the steps. He manages to walk up the steps. Eventually he manages to press the \nBUZZER \n4.106 INT. ELLE'S APARTMENT \u00ad DAY, SAME TIME \nElle hears the door buzzer. She is pale and underweight. \nShe gets up, walks to the apartment door. She presses the intercom button with trepidation. Her mouth is dry. \nELLE Yes? \nThe crackle of electric silence. Nothing. \n67 | P a g e Exasperated, she takes her finger off the button, turns away. \nThe buzzer sounds again. \nElle curses and turns back to it. \nShe hesitates, and then presses the answer button. \nELLE Hello? \nURI Mrs Pentane? It's Uri Tallow from the ministry. We spoke earlier? \nIt's hard to do this. It takes everything that's left of her. \nELLE Ah \u00ad yes. Come in. \nShe presses the buzzer door release. The front door opening sound, OS. Elle turns away from the door. She gathers herself. \nShe looks at her apartment door. She steps backwards from it, as if dreading what might be approaching it. Eventually she is in the middle of the large, open plan room staring at the door. A shadow is visible under the door. A shape. A man. The \nKNOCK \nOn her door makes her jump. She gathers herself. \nShe goes to the door. Eventually she opens it. \nUri stands there. He smiles thinly, extends a hand. As she takes it he looks at his hand. This hand killed her love. \n"}

{"train": "MATER Don't sweat it. These things happen to everybody, Otis. \nOTIS But you never leak oil. \nMATER Yeah, but I ain't perfect. Don't tell nobody, but I think my rust is starting to show through. \nMater and Otis drive past THE RADIATOR SPRINGS WELCOME SIGN. It has been amended to say: \"Home of Lightning McQueen.\" \nOTIS Hey, is Lightning McQueen back yet? \nMATER Not yet. \nOTIS He must be crazy-excited about winning his fourth Piston Cup. Four! Wow! \nMATER Yeah, we're so dadgum proud of him. But I sure wish he'd hurry up and get back `cause we got a whole summer's worth of best friend fun to make up for. Just me and -- \nAhead of them, a half-mile off, a RED RACE CAR is visible. \nMATER --- McQueen! \nMater FLOORS IT, dragging poor Otis behind him. \nOTIS Uh, Mater? I'm in no hurry. You don't need to go so fast! \nBoom! They hit a bump. Otis catches air. \nEXT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - DAY \nLightning McQueen is surrounded by his hometown friends. \nLUIGI Oh, Lightning. Welcome home. \nFLO Good to have you back, honey. \nFILLMORE Congratulations, man. \nSARGE Welcome home, soldier. \nSHERIFF The place wasn't the same without you, son. \nLIZZIE What? Did he go somewhere? \nMCQUEEN It's good to be home, everybody. \nMATER (O.S.) McQueen! \nThey all turn around, see Mater speeding into town, with Otis swerving behind him. \nMCQUEEN Mater! \nMATER McQueen! \nMater skids into main street and in one swift motion, slingshots Otis forward --- \nOTIS Woaahhhhh! \n--- right through Ramone's front door --- \nINT. RAMONE'S - CONTINUOUS \n--- where he lands perfectly on the hydraulic lift. Ramone lifts him up, routine. \nRAMONE Hey. How far'd you make it this time, Otis? \nOTIS Halfway to the county line. \nRAMONE Not bad, man. \nOTIS I know, I can't believe it either! \nEXT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - CONTINUOUS \nMATER McQueen, welcome back! \nMCQUEEN Mater, it's so good to see you. \nMATER You too, buddy. \nMater and McQueen do an ELABORATE TIRE BUMP (fist bump style). \nMATER Oh, man. You ain't gonna believe the things I got planned for us. \nEveryone watches as the tire bump continues. \nMACK (to Lizzie, an aside) These best friend greetings get longer every year. \nMATER (TO MCQUEEN) You ready to have some serious fun? \nMCQUEEN Well, actually I've got something to show you first. \nINT. RADIATOR SPRINGS MUSEUM - DAY \nCLOSE ON THE PISTON CUP. It has now changed, been adorned with a small likeness of Doc. It says \"Hudson Hornet Piston Cup.\" \nMATER Wow. I can't believe they renamed the Piston Cup after our very own Doc Hudson. \nMcQueen and Mater are alone, the museum closed to the public. McQueen approaches a \"Hudson Hornet\" wall with Doc's three Piston cups, framed articles, other racing ephemera. \nMCQUEEN I know Doc said these things were just old cups, but to have someone else win it just didn't feel right, you know? \nMATER Well, Doc would've been real proud of you. That's for sure. \nMcQueen takes this in. \nMATER Now, can I start you two lovebirds off with a couple drinks? \nMCQUEEN Yes. I'll have my usual. \nSALLY You know what? I'm going to have that too. \nMater blinks. \nMATER Uh, right. Your usual. CUT TO: \nINSIDE AT THE BAR - Fillmore and Sarge watch as Guido mixes drinks, ala \"Cocktail.\" Mater arrives. \nMATER Guido! What's McQueen's usual? \nGUIDO (in Italian, subtitled) How should I know? \nMATER Perfect! Give me two of `em. \nSARGE Quiet! My program's on. \nMEL DORADO (O.S.) Tonight on \"The Mel Dorado Show\"! \nON THE BAR TV - \"THE MEL DORADO SHOW,\" a cable talk show, begins with file footage of MILES AXLEROD, a sleek SUV. \nMEL DORADO (ON TV) His story gripped the world! Oil billionaire Miles Axlerod, in an attempt to become the first car to circumnavigate the globe without GPS, ironically ran out of gas and found himself trapped in the wild! \nWe see images of newspaper headlines, search crews. \nMEL DORADO (ON TV) Feared dead, he emerged 36 days later, running on a fuel he'd distilled himself from the natural elements! Since then he's sold his oil fortune, converted himself from a gas-guzzler into an electric car, and has devoted his life to finding a renewable, clean-burning fuel! \nImages of oil derricks torn down; Miles Axlerod getting converted to electric; lab scientists testing chemicals. \nMEL DORADO (ON TV) Now he claims to have done it with his Allinol. \nImages of fields, rivers, vegetables, and mountains all combining to form the Allinol logo. \nMEL DORADO (ON TV) And to show the world what his new superfuel can do, he's created a racing competition like no other, inviting the greatest champions from around the globe to battle in the first ever World Grand Prix. Welcome Sir Miles Axlerod. \nSIR MILES AXLEROD arrives, parks across from Mel's desk. \nMILES AXLEROD (ON TV) Thank you, Mel. It is very good to be here. Now listen to me: Big Oil. It costs a fortune. Pollution is getting worse. I mean, come on. It's a fossil fuel. Fossil. As in dead dinosaurs. And we all know what happened to them. Alternative energy is the future. Trust me, Mel, after seeing Allinol in action at the World Grand Prix, nobody will ever go back to gasoline again. \nMATER (TO FILLMORE) What happened to the dinosaurs, now? \nMEL DORADO (ON TV) And on satellite, a World Grand Prix competitor and one of the fastest cars in the world, Francesco Bernoulli. \nAcross the screen: LIVE FROM ROME, ITALY. We meet Formula race car FRANCESCO BERNOULLI. \nFRANCESCO (ON TV) It is an honor, Signore Dorado. For you. \nMEL DORADO (ON TV) Miles, why not invite Lightning McQueen? \nMater, collecting his drinks, looks up, half-intrigued. \nMILES AXLEROD (ON TV) Of course we invited him. But apparently after a very long racing season he is taking some time off to rest. \nFRANCESCO (ON TV) Lightning McQueen would not have a chance against Francesco! \nMater doesn't like this. \nFRANCESCO (ON TV) I can go over 300 kilometers an hour! In miles that is like, uh... way faster than McQueen. \nMEL DORADO (ON TV) Let's go to the phones. Baltimore, Maryland, you're on the air. \nCALLER (ON TV) Am I on? Hello? \nMEL DORADO (ON TV) You're on. Go ahead. \nCALLER (ON TV) Hello? \nMEL DORADO (ON TV) Go ahead, caller. \nDial tone. \nMEL DORADO (ON TV) Let's go to Radiator Springs. You're on, caller. \nMATER'S VOICE (ON TV) Yeah, that Italian feller you got on there can't talk that way about Lightning McQueen. He's the bestest race car in the whole wide world. \nFillmore and Sarge look around. Mater is visible in the back of the bar on an office phone. \nSARGE Uh-oh... \nFRANCESCO (ON TV) If he is, how you say \"the bestest race car,\" then why must he rest, eh? \nMATER'S VOICE (ON TV) Cause he knows what's important. Every now and then he prefers just to slow down, enjoy life. \nFRANCESCO (ON TV) Ah, you heard it! Lightning McQueen prefers to be slow! Of course, this is not news to Francesco. When I want to go to sleep I watch one of his races. After two laps I am out cold. \nAudible RXNS from the bar. A crowd has been forming ever since Mater started talking. \nMATER'S VOICE (ON TV) That ain't what I meant. CUT TO: \nMCQUEEN AND SALLY - They hear the commotion inside. \nMCQUEEN Hey, what's going on over there? CUT BACK TO: \nTHE BAR - Sally and McQueen push through the crowd, see that they're watching Francesco on the television. \nMCQUEEN (TO SALLY) Oh, it's that Italian Formula car. His name is --- \nSALLY Francesco Bernoulli. No wonder there's a crowd. \nWhen Sally says his name, she enunciates each part, as if Italian were her mother's tongue. \nTeam McQueen enters via a second floor landing which overlooks a massive indoor party in a converted museum. As they roll down a ramp to the party, they are awed. \nLUIGI Guido, look! Ferraris and tires! Let's go! \nMCQUEEN (IMPRESSED) Hey, look at this. Okay now Mater, remember: best behavior. \nMATER You got it, buddy. Hey, what's that? \nHe sees something, peels away. \nMCQUEEN Mater! \nLEWIS HAMILTON Hey, McQueen, over here! \nIt's fellow racers JEFF GORVETTE and LEWIS HAMILTON. McQueen now has no choice but to let Mater go. \nMCQUEEN Hey, Jeff. Lewis! CUT TO: \nMATER as he approaches a GLASS-ENCLOSED ROCK GARDEN where a pitty RAKES rocks with precision. He knocks on the glass with his hook. \nMATER Hey! You done good! You got all the leaves! \nPeople turn at the noise he's making. CUT BACK TO: \nMCQUEEN, JEFF and LEWIS. \nJEFF GORVETTE Check out that tow truck. \nLEWIS HAMILTON I wonder who that guy's with? \nMCQUEEN Will you guys excuse me just for one little second? \nHe zips over to Mater's side, quickly pulls him out of sight. \nMCQUEEN Mater, listen. This isn't Radiator Springs. \nMATER You're just realizing that? Boy, that jet-lag really done a number on you. \nMCQUEEN Mater, look -- things are different over here. Which means maybe you should, you know, act a little different too. \nMATER Different than what? \nMCQUEEN Well, just... help me out here, buddy. I --- \nMATER You need help? Shoot, why didn't you just say so? That's what a tow truck does. Hey, looky there, it's Mr. San Francisco! \nFRANCESCO is visible across the room, holding court. \nMATER I'll introduce you. \nMCQUEEN Mater, no. \nMATER (already on his way) Look at me -- I'm helping you already! \nOn FRANCESCO - MOMENTS LATER. Mater approaches, giddy. \nMATER Hey Mr. San Francisco, I'd like you to meet --- \nFRANCESCO Lightning McQueen! Buona sera. \nMCQUEEN Nice to meet you, Francesco. \nFRANCESCO Yeah, nice to meet you too. You are very good-looking. Not as good as I thought, but you're good. \nMATER (TO FRANCESCO) Excuse me. Can I get a picture with you? \nFRANCESCO Anything for McQueen's friend. \nAs Mater poses for a photo with Francesco: \nMATER Miss Sally is gonna flip when she sees this. She's Lightning McQueen's girlfriend. \nFRANCESCO Oooh. \nMATER She's a big fan of yours. \nFRANCESCO Hey, she has good taste. \nMCQUEEN Mater's prone to exaggeration. I wouldn't say she's a \"big\" fan. \nMATER You're right. She's a huge fan. She goes on and on about your open wheels here. \nMCQUEEN Mentioning it once doesn't qualify as going \"on and on.\" \nFRANCESCO Francesco is familiar with this reaction to Francesco. Women respect a car that has nothing to hide. \nMCQUEEN Yeah, uh... \nFRANCESCO Let us have a toast. \nMcQueen doesn't like where this is going, covers. \nMCQUEEN Let's. \nFRANCESCO (raising a drink) I dedicate my win tomorrow... to Miss Sally. \nMCQUEEN Oh, sorry. I already dedicated MY win tomorrow to her. So if we both do it, it's really not so special. Besides, I don't have a drink. \nMATER I'll go get you one. You mind if I borrow a few bucks for one of them drinks? \nMCQUEEN (could kill him) They're free, Mater. \nMATER Free? Well, shoot, what am I doing here? \nMATER Oh, same ol', same ol'. What's up with you? That looks delicious. \nThe chef starts to carve a small scoop aside for Mater. \nMATER Uh, a little more, please. It is free, right? (the chef adds more) Keep it coming. A little more. Come on, let's go, it's free! You're getting there... Scoop scoop! \nThe chef gives in. Scoops a baseball-sized ball out. \nMATER There you go. Now THAT's a scoop of ice cream. \nSUSHI CHEF (in Japanese, subtitles) My condolences. CUT BACK TO: \nMILES AXLEROD - He's now nearly done with his intros. \nMILES AXLEROD ... and now, our last competitor --- Number 95, Lightning McQueen! \nMCQUEEN approaches the microphone, flashes his headlights. \nMCQUEEN Thank you so much for having us, Sir Axlerod. I really look forward to racing. This is a great opportunity. \nMILES AXLEROD Oh, the pleasure is all ours, Lightning. You and your team bring excellence and professionalism to this competition. \nAs if on cue, Mater arrives with a piercing scream of pain. Everyone turns as he charges head first toward the stage, making a bee-line for that FOUNTAIN. \nMATER Somebody get me water! \nHe laps up water from the fountain like a diabetic cat. \nMATER (LAPPING WATER) Sweet relief... \nMiles Axlerod is shocked. The crowd can't believe it. Francesco cackles. Mater, now sated, approaches the mic. \nMATER (to the crowd) Whatever you do, do not eat the free pistachio ice cream. It has turned! \nMCQUEEN Sir Axlerod, I can explain. This is Mater. \nMILES AXLEROD I know him. This is the bloke that called into the television show. (TO MATER) You're the one I have to thank. \nMATER No, thank you. This trip's been amazing. \nMILES AXLEROD (TO MCQUEEN) He's a little excited, isn't he? \nTILT DOWN to reveal a pool of oil beneath Mater. \nMCQUEEN Mater! \nMATER But wait, I... oh, shoot. \nMcQueen quickly pulls Mater aside, out of earshot of Miles Axlerod and the others. McQueen is beside himself. \nMCQUEEN Mater, you have to get a hold of yourself. You're making a scene. \nMATER But I never leak oil. Never. \nMCQUEEN Go take care of yourself right now. \nMater drives off. \nON MATER - MOMENTS LATER \nHe drives through the party, frantic. \nMATER Coming through! Excuse me, leakin' oil. Where's the bathroom? Thank you. I gotta go! \nSomeone points Mater down a hallway. He whips around the CORNER --- \n--- and STOPS. Finds himself in front of TWO BATHROOM DOORS, neither of which clearly indicate MALE or FEMALE. \nMATER (CONFUSED) What the... \nMater chooses one, drives inside. A SHRIEK is heard and Mater zips out. \nMATER Sorry ladies! \nHe heads into the other door --- CUT TO: \nINT. MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT \nMater rolls in, still `holding it in' like a kid. \nMATER I never leak I never leak I never leak... \nHe sees someone leaving a stall. He heads in. \nIN THE STALL - Mater enters, looks up. \nMATER Wowee... \nThe stall is a complicated apparatus with buttons and lights. High-tech Japanese. It suddenly GRABS MATER, hoists him up as if he's going to get an oil change. \nMATER What in the--- \nA Japanese style cartoon CARICATURE appears on a TV MONITOR, followed by images of waterfalls and rivers. \nMATER (GIGGLING) Hey, that tickles. \nThe caricature starts talking in Japanese. Suddenly WATER FIRES UP underneath Mater's undercarriage, goosing him. He freaks out. \nOUTSIDE THE STALL - With Mater's yells audible we see a GREMLIN enter, furtive. Suddenly, inexplicably, his frame BREAKS APART like an egg, revealing an AMERICAN MUSCLE CAR underneath. The pieces of the Gremlin disappear under him, clearly his disguise. This is ROD REDLINE - American Agent. \nROD REDLINE Okay, McMissile. I'm here. It's time for the drop. \nINT. PARTY - SAME \nHOLLEY (INTO RADIO) Extremely. \nFINN (OVER RADIO) Then it's him. \nIt's settled. Holley takes one more nervous breath, quickly closes the distance between her and Mater, cuts him off. He is forced to STOP. \nHOLLEY Hello. \nMATER Well, hello. \nHOLLEY A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia has no radiator. \nMATER Well of course it doesn't. That's `cause it's air-cooled! \nHOLLEY (RELIEVED) Perfect. I'm from the Tokyo Station OF THE--- \nMATER Course, Karmann Ghia's weren't the only ones. Besides the Beetles you had your Type-3 Squarebacks, with the pancake motors... \nHOLLEY Yeah. Okay, I get it--- \nMATER ... And before both of them, there's the Type-2 buses - my buddy Fillmore's one of them. \nHOLLEY Listen! We should find somewhere more private. \nMATER Uh, gee. Don't you think that's a little, uh --- \nHOLLEY (NERVOUS ENERGY) You're right. Impossible to know which areas here are compromised. So, when can I see you again? \nMATER Well, let's see. Tomorrow I'll be out there at the races. \nHOLLEY Got it. We'll rendezvous then. \nINT. PARTY - MOMENTS LATER \nMater returns to his team, lost in thought. \nMCQUEEN There you are. Where have you been? \nMATER What's a rendezvous? \nLUIGI It's like a date. \nMATER A date?! \nMCQUEEN Mater, what's going on? \nMATER Well, what's going on is I've got me a date tomorrow. \nGuido makes a crack in Italian. \nLUIGI Guido don't believe you. \nMATER Well, believe it. My new girlfriend just said so. Hey, there she is. \nMater points out Holley, who's within earshot. \nMATER (YELLING) Hey! Hey lady! \nHolley, caught in plain view, DRIVES OFF. \nMATER See ya tomorrow! \nGuido makes another crack in Italian. \nLUIGI Guido still don't believe you. \nEXT. SHIPYARD - THE DOCKS - TOKYO NIGHT \nAn industrial dock, outside of the city proper. \nINT. SHIPYARD - NIGHT \nRod Redline dangles from a car magnet. He's been beaten up, clings to consciousness. \nGREM (O.S.) I gotta admit --- \nGrem, Acer, and a bunch of nasty looking troublemakers look up at Rod amidst crates and shipping containers. \nGREM --- you tricked us real good. \nACER And we don't like being tricked. \nRod Redline laughs to himself. \nACER Hey, what's so funny? \nROD REDLINE Well, you know, I was just wearing a disguise. You guys are stuck looking like that. \nThis doesn't help him. They DROP HIM onto a TREADMILL, lock him down. A container is wheeled forward and Rod is plied with Allinol brand gasoline. \nROD REDLINE Allinol? Thanks, fellas. I hear this stuff is good for you. \nPROFESSOR ZUNDAPP (O.S.) So you think. \nThe Professor emerges from the darkness, behind Rod. \nPROFESSOR ZUNDAPP Allinol by itself is good for you. \nZundapp hits a button and the TREADMILL starts Rod's wheels spinning at a high rate of speed. \nPROFESSOR ZUNDAPP But after microscopic examination, I have found that it has one small weakness. When hit with an electromagnetic pulse, it becomes extremely dangerous. \nGREM SMILE --- \nON MATER - Slowing at the flower shop. \nHOLLEY (OVER RADIO) No! Don't go 'in' anywhere. Just keep moving. \nMATER Stay outside. Gotcha. \nON THE TRACK \nMCQUEEN Outside? \nMcQueen drifts outside allowing Francesco to slip past! \nFRANCESCO Grazie and arrivaderci! \nDARRELL CARTRIP (V.O.) I cannot believe what I just saw, Brent. That was a bonehead move. You don't open up the inside like that! \nIN THE BACK ALLEYS - As Mater moves on he's followed by Pacers and Gremlins. Suddenly --- \n--- CABLES whip in front of them, pulling over flower vending machines and sending the shop's owners into a frenzy. They direct their attention to the AMCs, who try and explain. \nON FINN, admiring his handiwork as he appears. Just as he turns to leave he's BROADSIDED and pushed INTO A DARK ALLEY. \nIN THE ALLEY - Finn finds himself boxed by two Pacers and pushed toward --- \n--- ACER, who now holds a FLAME THROWER. \nACER This time I'm gonna make sure you stay dead. \nHe hits the flame. WHOOOSSSH!! \nON ANOTHER STREET - Mater clicks along, still looking for Holley. Just as he passes the alley entrance where Finn stares down death: \nHOLLEY (OVER RADIO) You're doing brilliantly. Now just stay focused. \nMATER What's that? You want me to head toward that ruckus? \nMater turns INTO the alley. \nHOLLEY (OVER RADIO) No! Don't go down that street! \nIN THE ALLEY - Finn, now nearly pushed completely into the flame thrower, leaps into the air. He FIGHTS BACK, using his wheels, axle, indeed his entire car frame as if he were human, kicking and tossing and shooting his enemies. \nMater witnesses the whole thing. \nMATER Wow! A live karate demonstration! \nON THE TRACK - McQueen, now playing catch-up again, scowls. \nMCQUEEN Stop it, Mater. Just sign off. \nIN THE BACK ALLEY - Finn polishes off the AMCs by firing a bullet into a gas main line, causing an EXPLOSION that tosses Acer through the air where he lands in a NOODLE SHOP'S SIGN. \nON THE TRACK - The end of the race is nigh --- \nBRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.) They're bumper to bumper as they approach the finish line! \nThe Formula car gets there first. \nBRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.) Francesco's the winner, McQueen's number two! \nIN THE ALLEY - Finn heaves breaths, surveys his damage. \nMATER That was cool! Hey, can I get your autograph? \nMater approaches when a MASS OF RACE FANS burst out a door, momentarily blocking Mater's view of Finn. Once the fans have past, Finn has disappeared. \nMATER Hey, where'd he go? \nHOLLEY (OVER RADIO) Our rendezvous has been jeopardized. Keep the device safe. We'll be in touch. \nMATER Dadgum, did I miss our date? \nEXT. PRESS STAGE - LATER \nPost race press conference. Francesco is center stage. \nDARRELL CARTRIP Francesco, over here! Hey, what was your strategy today? \nFRANCESCO Strategia? Francesco needs no strategy, it's very simple. You start the race, wait for Lightning McQueen to choke, pass him, then win. Francesco always wins. It's boring. \nMcQueen, waiting in the wings, rolls his eyes. He suddenly notices something O.S. \nMcQueen's P.O.V. - It's MATER, appearing from a side street, moving toward the pits, oblivious of the press conference. \nDARRELL CARTRIP (TO FRANCESCO) I gotta tell you, dude. You were in trouble for awhile. That dirt track section had you crawling! \nAs McQueen SNEAKS AWAY --- \nFRANCESCO To truly crush one's dream, you must first raise their hopes very high. \nIN MCQUEEN'S PIT GARAGE - Mater looks around for everyone as McQueen approaches. \nMCQUEEN Mater. \nMATER Hey McQueen! What happened? Is the race over? You won, right? \nMCQUEEN Mater, why were you yelling things at me while I was racing? \nMATER Yelling? Oh, you thought... that's funny right there. Nah, see that's `cause I seen these two fellers doing some sort of karate street performance. It was nutso. One of them even had a flamethrower --- \nMCQUEEN A flamethrower? What are you talking about? I don't understand. Where were you? \nMATER Going to meet my date. \nA MONTAGE OF PARIS: Mater attempts to merge into roundabout traffic; mimes annoy tourists at the Eiffel Tower; a painter works his magic on an unattractive couple; a couple kisses on the most romantic spot in the world; we might even catch GASTOW'S RESTAURANT. \nThe charming, low-key introduction ends with a SWEEPING VISTA of Paris's center from far away as we CRANE DOWN INTO --- \nEXT. STREET - DAY \n--- a dirty street in the 1st Arrondissement. Finn and Holley drive along together as Mater, playing \"spy,\" darts back and forth behind them from doorway to dumpster, \"hiding out.\" He's having a ball. \nFINN (TO HOLLEY) Once we're inside, stay close. Don't bother checking VIN numbers for criminal records, they're all dodgy here. \nHOLLEY No VIN scans. Got it. \nFINN Don't talk to anyone. Don't look at anyone. And absolutely, positively no idling. Are we clear? \nHOLLEY Yes, right. No idling. Yes, sir. \nFINN Mater? \nMATER Yeah, Finn? \nFINN We're not here to go shopping. \nAs Finn and Holley and Mater turn the corner... \nMATER Shopping? What do you mean? Why would I --- \nMater turns the corner and enters a massive Les Halles- inspired Parisian market filled with car parts. A tow truck's dream. \nMATER Dadgum. \nMERCHANTS - Parts for sale, Monsieur! - Monsieur! Parts for sale! \nIN THE MARKET - MOMENTS LATER \nMater rolls along, impressed by the goods for sale. \nMATER You gotta be kidding me - they've got everything here. Look at them hoods! I could use a hood. \nMater continues on though, heeding Finn's advice. \nMATER Sorry fellers, I gotta go. \nINT. ENCLOSED MARKETPLACE - DAY \nMater, now out of sight of Finn and Holley, passes a darkened stall. He STOPS, peers in. There's someone in there. \nMATER Excuse me. What are you selling? \nIt suddenly OPENS its headlights revealing... EYES!! In French, the mutant car pitches his wares to Mater. Mater FREAKS OUT, speeds off, TERRIFIED. \nAROUND THE CORNER - FINN AND HOLLEY \nA few car lengths ahead of Mater. They roll along, looking for... Aha! Finn and Holley recede into the shadows. \nIn FINN'S SIDE MIRROR: TOMBER, a three-wheeled parts dealer, argues with a French customer. \nFINN There you are. \nMater suddenly turns the corner, sees Finn and Holley. \nMATER Man, there are some great --- \nFINN Mater, get back! \nToo late. Tomber sees Mater, then notices FINN, reflected in a hubcap. He BOLTS. Finn and Holley give chase. \nMATER Hey, wait for me! \nTomber, skidding away, kicks a tent in Finn's way. Holley quickly pivots RIGHT and disappears. Where did she go? \nFinn, hot in pursuit, leaps another obstacle and loses ground TO --- \n--- Tomber who turns a corner and finds himself grill to grill with HOLLEY. He whips to the left but TURNS OVER, rolling sideways and CRASHING to a stop. \nHolley ZAPS him with ELECTROSHOCKERS. Finn suddenly arrives, stops her. \nFINN (TO HOLLEY) Have you lost your mind?! \nHOLLEY But I thought --- \nFINN Mater! This chap needs a tow. Hook him up. \nMATER Sure thing. CUT TO: \nMOMENTS LATER - Mater tows Tomber, following Finn and Holley. \nTOMBER You rusty piece of junk, get your dirty hook off me! \nINT. A SMALL GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER \nFinn throws open a door. Cars scatter like cockroaches. \nFINN (to the cars) Allez! Maintenant - vite! \nMater unhooks an angry Tomber who spits in French. Finn pulls the door down. As it LATCHES TIGHT --- \nTOMBER (TO FINN) Electroshock! Are you kidding me?? \nFINN Easy, Tomber. This is her first field assignment - she didn't know you were my informant. \nHOLLEY Informant? \nTOMBER A rookie, eh? I never liked new car- smell. \nHolley SNAPS Mater's picture, temporarily blinding him. \nMATER Ahh! \nHolley turns back to her monitor. Mater's face appears on screen. She quickly GRAFTS it over the Hugo's tow truck's. \nFINN Good job, Miss Shiftwell. \nHolley isn't sure what surprises her more: the compliment or how pleased it makes her. \nHOLLEY Thank you, Finn. \nMATER Boy, I sure wish my friends could see me now. \nEXT. SMALL TOWN - ITALY - OUTSIDE PORTO CORSA - DAY \nA quaint Italian piazza. A pristine MASERATI FOUNTAIN, complete with ancient trident, looms in our view. \nLuigi and Guido roll into view. \nLUIGI Guido, your eyes do not deceive you. We are in Italy. We are home! \nSarge, Fillmore and McQueen exit a WGP transport truck. \nFILLMORE Hey, Luigi. Which way to the hotel, man? \nLUIGI What? No friends of mine will stay in a hotel in my village. You will stay with my --- Uncle Topolino! \nUNCLE TOPOLINO, a distinguished 1937 Fiat Topolino, rolls forward. He greets them warmly with affectionate Italian salutations as word of Guido and Luigi's arrival spreads. The square FILLS with family and friends. \nEXT. PIAZZA - DUSK \nA festive homecoming party. Lights strung across the square. Music and dancing. Fillmore and Sarge are at a dining table. \nSARGE How do they do it? These are the same ingredients as back home, but it tastes so good. \nFILLMORE It's organic, man. \nSARGE Tree hugger. \nLIGHTNING MCQUEEN rolls along the periphery of the square, seems lost in thought. \nUNCLE TOPOLINO (O.S.) Race car. \nUncle Topolino beckons McQueen over. \nUNCLE TOPOLINO You look so down, so low. Is like you have flat tires. \nMAMA TOPOLINO, a hefty Italian grandmother pipes up, a mile a minute then drives off, now a car on a mission. \nUNCLE TOPOLINO She said you look like you're starving. That she's going to make you a big meal, and fatten you up. \nMCQUEEN No, Mama Topolino, please. You don't need to make a fuss! \nToo late. She's disappeared inside her kitchen. \nUNCLE TOPOLINO Capisco. I understand. Is a problem, yes? Between you and a friend? \nMCQUEEN How'd you know that? \nUNCLE TOPOLINO A wise car hears one word and understands two. \nMcQueen takes this in, impressed. \nUNCLE TOPOLINO That, and Luigi told me. While Mama cooks, come and take a stroll with me. \nThey amble forward, Uncle Topolino setting the pace. \nMCQUEEN I brought my friend Mater along on the trip. And I told him he needed to act different, that we weren't in Radiator Springs. \nUNCLE TOPOLINO This Mater. He's a close friend? \nMCQUEEN He's my best friend. \nUNCLE TOPOLINO Then why would you ask him to be someone else? \nMcQueen considers this - a realization. \nMCQUEEN What did I do? I said some things during our fight... \nUNCLE TOPOLINO You know, back when Guido and Luigi used to work for me, they would fight over everything. \nIN THE SQUARE - Guido dances with a girl. Luigi suddenly CUTS IN. They begin to ARGUE. \nUNCLE TOPOLINO They fight over what Ferrari was the best Ferrari; which one of them look more like a Ferrari... There were even some non-Ferrari fights. \nGuido now LIFTS Luigi, cuts BACK in. \nUNCLE TOPOLINO So I tell them, va bene. It's okay to fight. Everybody fights now and then, especially best friends. \nMcQueen takes this in. Seems to take some small comfort. \nUNCLE TOPOLINO But you gotta make up fast. \nMcQueen's comfort quickly evaporates. \nUNCLE TOPOLINO No fight more important than friendship. \nGuido and Luigi now dance together with the girl and her friend who has just arrived. All having a great time. They dance past us, crossing in front of MCQUEEN AND UNCLE TOPOLINO. We STAY WITH them. \nUNCLE TOPOLINO Chi trova un'amico, trova un tesoro. \nMCQUEEN What does that mean? \nFINN You look a little light on weapons. \nOff Mater's RXN --- \nEXT. ALPS - DAWN \n--- STEPHENSON EMERGES LOUDLY from a tunnel. He powers forward, starts his descent into Italy --- \nBRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.) You are looking live at beautiful Porto Corsa, Italy, on the Italian Riviera. What a magnificent setting for the second race of the World Grand Prix. \nEXT. PORTO CORSA, ITALY - DAY \nOver sweeping helicopter BEAUTY SHOTS: \nDAVID HOBBSCAP (V.O.) Well Brent, they call this place \"The Gem of the Riviera,\" and it's easy to see why. \nA local fishing boat chugs through an idyllic waterway, beneath bridges that connect hillside villas. \nDAVID HOBBSCAP (V.O.) With its secluded beaches and opulent casinos, Porto Corsa truly is a playground for the wealthy. \nA long line of RICH-LOOKING YACHTS in the harbor. \nDAVID HOBBSCAP (V.O.) And everyone who's anyone is here today. \nRich SPORTS CARS drive past pricey shops. \nDAVID HOBBSCAP (V.O.) From the ultra-rich and super- famous, to world leaders and important dignitaries. \nTHE POPEMOBILE, visible in a crowd, drives through town. \nDARRELL CARTRIP (V.O.) You aren't kidding, David. You can't do a three-point turn around here without bumping into some celebrity! \nHELICOPTER SHOT of the Casino. \nBRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.) Welcome everyone to the second race of the World Grand Prix! CUT TO: \nMUSTANGBURGER, HOBBSCAP and CARTRIP in the control booth. \nBRENT MUSTANGBURGER The big news continues to be Allinol. Sir Miles Axlerod spoke to the press earlier today to answer questions about its safety. \nFOOTAGE OF THE PRESS CONFERENCE - Miles Axlerod, at a podium, addresses the press throng. He looks a bit exasperated. \nMILES AXLEROD An independent panel of scientists has determined that Allinol is completely safe. Okay? Safe! There it is. \nBRENT MUSTANGBURGER So the race will go on, folks. \nRACE GRAPHICS show Francesco with 10 points at the top of the race standings. \nDARRELL CARTRIP But the question everyone is asking: Will the real Lightning McQueen show up today? \nON THE TRACK - As the racers begin to get into position on the grid. \nBRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.) Well, he better. Talk about a home- track advantage. Francesco Bernoulli grew up racing on this course. \nITALIAN TRACK ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Signore e signori, in the pole position, numero uno... \nThe crowd is cheering already, knows who this is. \nITALIAN TRACK ANNOUNCER (V.O.) ... Francescoooooo! \nThe Italian crowd roars and chants for their hometown hero. \nFRANCESCO (to the crowd) Bellissima! Thank you for your support. (TO MCQUEEN) And your big mistake, McQueen! \nMcQueen missed this comment. He approaches his grid position, lost in thought. \nITALIAN TRACK ANNOUNCER (V.O.) In the secondo position. Numero novantacinque. Lightning McQueen! \nCheers (not so thunderous, obviously) from the crowd. McQueen doesn't seem to notice. \nIN MCQUEEN'S PIT - His team exchanges looks, worried. \nLUIGI McQueen? Is everything okay? \nFILLMORE If you're worried about your fuel, man, don't. It's perfectly safe. \nBACK ON THE STARTING GRID \nMCQUEEN No, guys, I just really wish Mater were here. \nFRANCESCO (O.S.) Francesco understands, McQueen. \nFrancesco parks next to him, grinning. \nMCQUEEN Oh, great. Here it comes. What've you got, Francesco? \nFRANCESCO For famous race cars like Francesco and well... you, to be far away from home is not easy. \nMCQUEEN I think you forgot the insulting part of that insult. \nFRANCESCO Is no insult. When Francesco is away from home, he misses his mama just like you miss your tow truck amico. \nMCQUEEN Gee, I maybe misjudged you, because that's exactly how I --- \nFRANCESCO Of course, I am at home. And my mama is right here. \nFrancesco refers to his MAMA who sits in a special box in the crowd, cheering him on, blowing him kisses. \nFRANCESCO (YELLS) Mama! Don't worry, Mama! (MORE) \nFRANCESCO (CONT'D) McQueen is very sad! I will beat his cry-baby bottom today! \nMCQUEEN And there's the insult we were missing. Grazie! \nThe Hugos on either side of Mater exchange a look. \nHOLLEY (OVER RADIO) That's because it is, Mater. Now, be careful what you say. \nMATER Why is that? What do you mean don't talk to you? (more talking from Holley which we cannot hear) So you want me to stop talking to you. Right now? \nALEXANDER HUGO You are acting strange today, Ivan. \nMATER I have no idea what you're talking about... \nMATER'S P.O.V. - A digital readout isolates the Hugo and starts to scroll reams of information alongside. \nMATER ...Alexander Hugo, aka \"Chop Shop Alex.\" \nIN A WIDER SHOT we realize this display is invisible to all but Mater. Some of Alex's other alias' include \"Alexander Hu- Don't Go\" and \"Alexander the Not-So Great.\" \nMATER Hey, you got a lot of aka's, Alex. But I guess that makes sense seeings how you's wanted in France, Germany, the Czech Republic... \nHOLLEY (cutting in to his DISPLAY) Mater! Stop it! \nAlexander Hugo, unaware of Holley's interruption, whispers to Mater as they turn a corner. \nALEXANDER HUGO Okay, okay. Keep your voice down. You're gonna make me arrested. (to the other Hugos) Don't mess with Ivan today. He's in a bad mood. \nEXT. CASINO - DAY \nHolley, hearing this, can't believe it. \nFINN He's so good. \nINT. CASINO - DAY \nMater tows Victor inside a private room, where inside are the WORLD'S WORST CARS including VLADMIR TRUNKOV, TUBBS PACER and J. CURBY GREMLIN. \nVLADIMIR TRUNKOV Victor! \nTUBBS PACER Hey, Victor! \nJ. CURBY GREMLIN There you are. \nVLADIMIR TRUNKOV Come in, come in. \nJ. CURBY GREMLIN Victor Hugo. I'm J. Curby Gremlin, from Detroit. It's good to see you. Now we can start. \nVICTOR HUGO Is the big boss here yet? \nVLADIMIR TRUNKOV No, not yet. \nTUBBS PACER He's supposed to be here any minute. \nWHAM! A DOOR is thrown open O.S. Everyone turns, now silent. \nON THE DOOR - It sits open. No one enters. \nThe room of Lemons watch, nervous. \nON MATER - Nervously watching too. \nEXT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS \nFINN Here we go. \nINT. PRIVATE ROOM - CASINO - CONTINUOUS \nA car finally appears. It's Zundapp. \nPROFESSOR ZUNDAPP Guten Tag! \nEveryone looks disappointed. \nTUBBS PACER It's just the Professor. \nVICTOR HUGO Zundapp, when is he coming? \nPROFESSOR ZUNDAPP He's already here. \nMONITORS descend from the ceiling. On them, an image of AN ENGINE - the same bloody engine from the photo. But this is a LIVE image. The car is being worked on. \nVOICE Welcome, everyone. \nThe VOICE is garbled, scrambled. No way to determine who. \nENGINE VOICE I wish I could be with you on this very special day but... my clutch assembly broke. You know how it is. \nThe Lemons all nod in understanding. \nTUBBS PACER Been there. \nJ. CURBY GREMLIN Forget about it. \nVLADIMIR TRUNKOV We know how you feel. \nEXT. CASINO \nFINN Descramble that voice! \nHOLLEY (already on it) I'm trying... It's too sophisticated! \nINT. PRIVATE ROOM - CASINO - CONTINUOUS \nENGINE VOICE We are here to celebrate. Today all your hard work pays off. The world turned their backs on cars like us. They stopped manufacturing us, stopped making our parts. The only thing they haven't stopped doing is laughing at us. They've called us terrible names... \nOn VICTOR HUGO. \nENGINE VOICE They will come to us and they will have no choice, `cause they will need us. \nON FINN - He SPEEDS up a road, Grem and Acer visible ahead of him. He LEAPS over the crevasse toward the AMC cousins --- \nSuddenly, FINN FREEZES. He's immobilized in mid-air! \nHe looks up. A CHOPPER with a LARGE MAGNET hovers over him. \nACER (TO FINN) We figured you might stop by. \nENGINE VOICE (V.O.) And they will finally respect us. So hold your hoods high. After today you will never again be ashamed of who you are! \nGrem and Acer turn back to the camera. They line up Shu Todoroki, who's a bit further along now. \nFINN No! \nINT. PRIVATE ROOM - CASINO - CONTINUOUS \nENGINE VOICE Long live Lemons! \nEXT. RACE COURSE \nGrem ZAPS THE RACER. \nFlames burst from Todoroki. He loses control. \nBRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.) Number seven is loose! Shu Todoroki! \nShu takes down three more cars with him and others follow suit. It's a nightmare pileup. \nEXT. CASINO - SAME \nHolley sees Finn being flown away by the chopper. \nHOLLEY Finn. \nEXT. FINISH LINE - PORTO CORSA - CONTINUOUS \nBRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.) Bumper to bumper as they approach the finish line. \nMcQueen NOSES out Francesco for a win, both oblivious to what's just happened. \nBRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.) McQueen's the winner, Francesco's second. And they have no idea what happened behind them. \nMCQUEEN Yeah! \nFRANCESCO Dah! This is impossible! \nMCQUEEN That's what I'm talking about. Kachow! Hey, where are all the other cars? \nFRANCESCO What is going on? \nThey see the pile-up from an overhead monitor. Sirens blare as a MEDIC CHOPPER flies to the scene of the pile-up. \nMCQUEEN (REALIZES) Oh no. CUT TO: \nMILES AXLEROD - LATER. He's near the casino. He's completely surrounded, 360 degrees, by press. He's drowned out by a blizzard of questions. \nBRENT MUSTANGBURGER Sir Axlerod! Is the final race in London still going to take place? \nPULL BACK to reveal we are watching this on monitors in the PRIVATE CASINO ROOM with the Lemonheads, Zundapp and Mater. \nMILES AXLEROD (ON TV) I suppose that... Look, \"the show must go on\" as they say. But now is not the time to talk about... \nJ. CURBY GREMLIN I can't believe this is really happening. \nVLADIMIR TRUNKOV Shh, quiet! \nBRENT MUSTANGBURGER (ON TV) And Allinol? Will you require all the racers to still run on Allinol? \nVLADIMIR TRUNKOV Here it comes. \nOn Miles Axlerod: He's devastated. \nMILES AXLEROD (ON TV) I cannot in good conscience continue to risk the lives of any more race cars. The final race will not be run on Allinol. \nWILD WHOOPING CHEERS fill the room. Lemonade corks are popped. \nBRENT MUSTANGBURGER (ON TV) There you have it. A clearly devastated Sir Miles Axlerod announcing that he will not require the cars to use Allinol for the final race. \nPROFESSOR ZUNDAPP A toast! To the death of Allinol and alternative fuel forever! \nEXT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS \nHolley is already on the run. Speeding away. \nHOLLEY Mater. Abort the mission. They've got Finn. Get out of there. Get out of there right now! \nShe turns a corner and STOPS. \nHer escape is now blocked by the same HUGO THUGS she tricked before. Another vehicle appears BEHIND HER, LOOMS. \nIVAN THE TOW TRUCK How is your grandfather? \nINT. PRIVATE ROOM - CASINO - CONTINUOUS \nThe Lemonheads celebrate, chant \"Long live lemons!\" Mater, scared, turns to leave. He's stopped by ALEXANDER HUGO. \nALEXANDER HUGO Isn't this a great party, Ivan? \nMATER Oh yeah, it's unbelievable. \nALEXANDER HUGO You are not leaving, are you? \nJUST OFF THE PRESS STAGE - McQueen is led toward the exit. \nPRESS LIAISON Right this way, signore. \nMATER (O.S.) (DISTANT) McQueen! \nMCQUEEN Mater? \nMcQueen looks up but can only see A SEA OF VEHICLES, flashbulbs, cameras, TV trucks with those tall satellite antennae things that spindle toward the sky... \nBACK AT THE SECURITY BARRICADE - Mater, like a nimble running back, dances around to avoid capture by security. \nMATER McQueen! \nITALIAN SECURITY #1 Back up, sir. Stop moving! Stop! \nMater head fakes them and pushes through, into the crowd --- \nITALIAN SECURITY #1 Oy! Stop! Ferma li! \nIN THE CROWD - Mater shoves his way through. He's still far in the back. \nMATER McQueen! \nON MCQUEEN \nMCQUEEN That really sounded like Mater. Mater? \nPRESS LIAISON (TO MCQUEEN) Signore... \nON MATER, getting CLOSER... \nMATER McQueen, they're gonna kill you!! \nON MCQUEEN - Okay, he's positive that was his friend, but where is he? \nMCQUEEN Mater?! \nMcQueen spots a TOW HOOK, moving through the crowd toward him, \"Jaws\"-like. \nMCQUEEN Excuse me. \nMcQueen disappears into the press crowd. \nPRESS LIAISON No, no, where are you going? Please, Mr. McQueen! \nMcQueen pushes through the press. \nMCQUEEN Scusi. Mater! Scusi... \nMcQueen tracks the tow hook, gets closer. He pushes through the last few vehicles --- \nMCQUEEN Mater, I'm so glad to see you. I'm so sorr --- \nIt's NOT MATER. It's IVAN, the Hugo Thug's tow truck. \nIVAN THE TOW TRUCK Lightning McQueen! I am a huge fan. \nMCQUEEN (CONFUSED) Oh, I'm sorry. I thought I heard--- \nIVAN THE TOW TRUCK Yes, but that was me. I said, \"You killed out there today.\" You're the best. \nMCQUEEN What? Oh. I mean, thanks. \nPRESS LIAISON Right this way, signore --- \nNow the Press Liaison and his assistants are pushing McQueen back in the other direction --- \nMCQUEEN (as he's pulled away) I really thought I heard my friend. \nAs he's pulled away, press and onlookers start to come between him and Ivan, who hasn't moved. \nIVAN THE TOW TRUCK (TO MCQUEEN) In England you'll be finished. At the finish line. \nIvan is now obscured again. \nMCQUEEN Wait, what? \nThe ITALIAN PRESS being to swarm. \nPRESS LIAISON Please, the world press is waiting. You come with me, please. \nMcQueen is pulled back --- \nEXT. STREET - PORTO CORSA - MOMENTS LATER \n--- just as Mater, now BOUND and with HIS MOUTH TAPED, is pulled away and thrown into the back of a transport vehicle. He lands hard on his side, spits out his TAPE. \nMATER Let me go! \nPROFESSOR ZUNDAPP You actually care about that race car. A pity you didn't warn him in time. \nAs the doors close on Mater --- PHHHHHSSSSSSTTTTTTT! A thick, noxious gas starts to fill the truck. \nOn MATER as the knockout gas works its magic. HIS EYES CLOSE. CUT TO: \nBLACK SCREEN. \nMATER (V.O.) Idiot? Is that how you see me? \nFINN (V.O.) That's how everyone sees you. I tell you, that's the genius of it. \nFADE IN on Mater, back at the Casino, eyeing his reflection in the glass window. It's the same moment from before except now we are watching it from a DETACHED, FLOATING PERSPECTIVE. \nFinn and Holley take this in. \nHOLLEY Finn, he's not joking. \nFINN I know. \nMATER You were right, Finn. I'm a fool. And what's happened to McQueen is `cause I'm such a big one. This is all my fault. \nGREM and ACER arrive on a lift, roll into view on a catwalk. \nGREM Good, you're up! \nACER And just in time! \nGREM Professor Z wanted you to have a front row seat for the death of Lightning McQueen. \nMATER (HOPEFUL) He's still alive? \nAcer whips a sheet away, revealing the WGP CAMERA, turns it toward the clock face. \nACER Not for much longer. \nHe pushes the camera through an open small window, turns it toward the course. Mater DROPS down again --- \nFINN and HOLLEY CLICK FORWARD. \nEXT. LONDON - DAY \nBig Bentley's big hand CLICKS ahead another minute. But we're a bit farther away from it than before. \nSALLY (O.S.) We came as soon as you called. \nINT. MCQUEEN'S PIT - LONDON \nSally, flanked by Red, Flo and Ramone, are in front of ---- \n--- McQueen and the rest of the team. \nMCQUEEN I called to talk to Mater.

Someone's entering the pit. Everyone parts, revealing MILES AXLEROD. \nMCQUEEN Sir Axlerod. \nMILES AXLEROD I'm sorry to interrupt. \nMCQUEEN No, no, it's all right. \nMILES AXLEROD I just wanted to come down here and personally thank you. Because after Italy, I was finished. And then you gave me one last shot. \nMCQUEEN Listen, I --- \nMILES AXLEROD And I probably shouldn't be saying this at all but... I hope you win today. Show the world that they've been wrong about Allinol. \nMcQueen takes this in. He looks at Sally. \nSALLY Mater would want you to race. \nMCQUEEN All right. For Mater. \nEXT.

BIG BENTLEY - LONDON \nZundapp suddenly SQUAWKS over the radio. \nPROFESSOR ZUNDAPP (OVER RADIO) What happened!? \nGREM I don't know, Professor. \nACER What did you do? \nHOLLEY Trying to turn back time. If I can just reverse the polarity... \nShe FIRES them again. Direct hit! \nHolley JUICES the gearbox with HIGH VOLTAGE. The CLOCK STOPS. It reverses itself. \nFinn and Holley's wheel now rotates AWAY from danger. \nFINN Good job! Quick thinking, Holley! \nEXT. LONDON - CONTINUOUS \nBIG BENTLEY, visible from street level, now moves BACKWARDS. Fast. CRANE DOWN TO --- \n--- Mater, speeding toward the track, unaware. \nMATER What's everybody on the wrong side of the road for?! \nINT. BIG BENTLEY - CONTINUOUS \nFinn and Holley are now moving in the opposite direction, toward ANOTHER GEAR! And it's going MUCH FASTER. They're seconds from a crushing death... \nHOLLEY Oh no! \nFINN Drive! \nThey both DRIVE, fast as they can with FULL FORCE --- \nFINN Burn rubber!! \nThey drive HARDER, separating bumpers with just enough room for the descending gear to SNAP THEIR ROPES! \nTheir tires spinning, they both LAUNCH off in opposite directions, LAND HARD on opposing platforms. As Finn squeals around to Holley's side of the clock: \nFINN We've got to get to the course. Calculate the fastest way to --- \nHolley pops WINGS out of her side. \nHOLLEY Done. \nFINN (IMPRESSED) Miss Shiftwell. \nHOLLEY They're standard issue now. \nFINN You kids get all the good hardware. \nThey turn to leave when they STOP, see SOMETHING. It's an AIR FILTER on the ground. \nHOLLEY Oh no. That's Mater's. \nFINN I knew his escape was too easy. \nEXT. BIG BENTLEY - LONDON \nFinn BURSTS out the front doors of Big Bentley, speeds off as HOLLEY SMASHES through the clock face, careens into view flying over the traffic --- \nINT. PIT ROW - TRACK SIDE - DAY \nMater bursts through the security gate with aplomb, tears through the pits and stops at MCQUEEN'S. \nLUIGI Mater! \nMATER Everybody get out! Get out now!

LONDON STREETS - CONTINUOUS \nFINN Mater, listen to me. The bomb is on you. \nON HIS REARVIEW DISPLAY: We can see that a BOMB has been detected, anchored to Mater's air filter. \nFINN They knew you'd try to help McQueen. When we were knocked out they planted it in your air filter. \nINT. MCQUEEN'S PIT - CONTINUOUS \nMater SNORTS, blowing his air filter cover off. Cross-eyed, Mater sees the explosive device attached to him. He looks up: \nAn ALLINOL CONTAINER hangs ominously over his head. \nMATER Uh-oh. \nMCQUEEN Mater! There you are! \nMater turns. McQueen enters Pit Row, 100 yards away and closing in FAST. \nMATER Stop right there! \nMCQUEEN Oh man, I've been so worried about you! CUT TO: \nZundapp is still furiously hitting the button as Holley drops into view just beyond the glass. \nFreaked, Zundapp does a 180 and SMASHES out a plate glass window, lands on a ridiculously large balloon tethered to the ground, and speeds off --- \nINT. ADJACENT LUXURY BOX - CONTINUOUS \nThe LEMONHEADS watch, baffled, as Zundapp drives away. \nJ.

Suddenly --- WHAP! \nHe's been TETHERED by Finn with tensile cables now attached to his rear end. Zundapp SCREAMS like a little girl. \nFINN Do you really think I'm going to let you float away, Professor? \nFinn reels him in. Zundapp spins his wheels, caught. \nSuddenly Zundapp miraculously, inconceivably, GAINS TRACTION! Now it's FINN'S WHEELS that are spinning. \nON THE COMBAT SHIP - the ELECTROMAGNET has been turned outward and switched on. He's PULLING ZUNDAPP AND FINN IN with the magnetic force.

Zundapp, the \"rope\" in this tug-of-war, buckles under the tension. \nPROFESSOR ZUNDAPP Give it up, McMissile! \nFinn releases a mess of bullets, grenades, and other weaponry into the air --- \nTHE MAGNET SUCKS it in quickly like a black hole --- \nTHUNK! It all sticks to the magnet, right next to Finn's bullets. They're BOMBS, GRENADES, ROCKETS and one little detonator with a flashing, beeping light. \nOff the boat's RXN --- CUT TO: \nANOTHER PART OF LONDON, AT STREET LEVEL \nKA-BOOOOOOM! A distant explosion (miles away) festoons into the air, visible over the rooftops. Holley suddenly WINGS into view. She sees --- \nMater and McQueen, speeding up the street. \nHOLLEY Mater, stop! \nMATER No way! You could get hurt! \nThen she looks over, catches a glimpse of GREM AND ACER, bearing down on them from a side street. They're going to broadside Mater and McQueen. \nHOLLEY Oh no. \nON MATER AND MCQUEEN - They're not aware of the impending impact. \nHolley DROPS FROM THE SKY, hits the pavement, SKIDS into the path of the AMCs and DEFLECTS THEM. They FLIP OVER Holley, Finn and McQueen and sail --- \n--- INTO A PUB --- \n--- where they skid across the room and SLAM into the bar, knocking a ROW OF BEER MUGS to the ground. \nIN THE PUB - MOMENTS LATER \nMater KARATE CHOPS lemons, three and four at a time. \nRamone SPRAY PAINTS a lemon's windshield. \nTUBBS PACER Retreat! \nA few Lemons turn back the way they came. BLOCKING THEIR PATH are a line of BRITISH MILITARY VEHICLES clad in digital camo, led by SARGE. \nSARGE Thanks for the help, Corporal. \nBRITISH CORPORAL Anything for one of pop's mates. \nAnd in the middle of all of this craziness we CUT TO --- \n--- MATER. WRENCH BITS are strewn all around him as Guido tries wrench after wrench to take the bolts off. No dice. Guido gestures wildly, spits Italian a mile a minute. \nMCQUEEN What's he saying?! What's wrong!? \nLUIGI None of his wrenches fit the bolts! \nThis is a light bulb moment for Mater. He eyes the bolts. \nMATER I get it. I get it! I know what needs to be done. \nMCQUEEN Then do it! \nMATER What? No, I can't do it. Look, nobody takes me seriously. I know that now. This ain't Radiator Springs. \nMCQUEEN Yes it is. \nMater looks at McQueen. It is? \nMCQUEEN You're yourself in Radiator Springs. Be yourself here. And if people aren't taking you seriously, then they need to change. Not you. I know that, because I was wrong before. Now you can do this. You're the bomb. \nMATER Thanks, buddy. \nMCQUEEN No no no, you're the actual bomb. Now let's go! \nMATER Oh, right! Hang on! \nMater HOOKS McQueen and they're off. \nThey SHOOT PAST FINN, who's in the middle of battling lemons. \nFINN Where's he going? \nON MATER AND MCQUEEN - Flying down a side street. \nMATER Computer! \nMATER'S COMPUTER Yes, Agent Mater. \nMATER I need that thing you done before to get me away from McQueen! \nMATER'S COMPUTER Request acknowledged. \nThe ROCKET THRUSTERS kick in. They head right for a WALL. \nMCQUEEN Mater... \nMATER Now I need you to do the chute, the second kind not the first! \nMATER'S COMPUTER Deploying chute. \nMater's chute POPS OPEN, catching air and sending Mater and McQueen SAILING INTO THE AIR. \nMater starts to steer them the direction he wants. He and McQueen are FLYING OVER LONDON. \nEXT. BALCONY - BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY \nThe QUEEN, her attendants, assorted dignitaries are here. \nQUEEN Who's winning the race? \nMater and McQueen drop from the sky.

Somebody's been sabotaging the racers and hurting the cars and I know who. Oh wait... Your Majesty. \nMater BOWS to the Queen. In doing so, the TICKING TIME BOMB angles into view. The clock's at T-minus 1:53. \nQUEEN'S GUARDS - Bomb! - It's a bomb! - Everybody down! - Look out! \nFINN (O.S.) Hold your fire! He can't disarm it! \nFinn dives onto the platform and rolls between the Queen and Mater. \nFINN Mater, I don't know what you're doing but stand down now! \nMATER (aside, to McQueen) This ain't nothing at all like Radiator Springs. \nMCQUEEN Mater, just cut to the chase! \nMATER Okay. \nHe turns to Miles Axlerod. \nLORD STEWARD Your Majesty. May I present for the investiture of honorary Knighthood of the British Realm. Tow Mater of Radiator Springs. \nMCQUEEN Go get `em, buddy. \nMcQueen joins his friends from Radiator Springs. Mater rolls forward. He bows, as if he's practiced it all day. \nQUEEN I hereby dub thee \"Sir Tow Mater.\" \nApplause from all around. \nMATER (LOOKS UP) \"Sir?\" Shoot, you can just call me Mater, Your Majesty. I don't wanna hear none of this \"Sir\" business. By the way, have y'all met each other? Queen? McQueen. McQueen, Queen. McQueen? McMissile. (MORE) \nMATER (CONT'D) McMissile, McQueen. Queen?

VAN and MINNY are front and center. \nMATER So there I was: rocket jets going full blast, McQueen hanging on for dear life when suddenly them two nasty lemons come out of nowhere, guns drawed. We was goners. But then out of nowhere, this beautiful spy car swoops in from the sky to save us! \nMINNY That's a very entertaining story, young man. \nVAN Oh, Minny, please. Come on, none of this happened. Rocket jets? Flying spy cars? \nHOLLEY No, you're quite right. It does sound a bit far-fetched. \nThe crowd turns, sees HOLLEY, wings out, swooping in. FINN is right below her, driving up the street. \nMATER Holley! Finn! \nHOLLEY Hello, Mater. It's so nice to see you again. \nMATER What're you doing here? \nFINN Our satellites picked up an urgent communique. \nLUIGI So you got my e-mail. \nMATER Oh, man. Y'all is gonna have a great time. Everybody! This here's Finn McMissile. He's a secret agent. (WHISPERS) Don't tell nobody. And this is Holley Shiftwell. She's --- \nHOLLEY I'm Mater's girlfriend. It's so nice to meet you all. \nEveryone is shocked. Including Mater. Guido's jaw drops. \nLUIGI (TO MATER) Guido believe you now. \nFLO (TO HOLLEY) Whoa, honey. You got a nasty dent there. \nIndeed, Holley still wears the dent from when she saved Mater from Grem and Acer. \nVAN (already crushing on her) Was that from when you swooped in and saved them in London? \nMINNY Van! \nVAN What? I'm just asking. \nFLO (TO HOLLEY) Don't you worry, sweet pea. My baby Ramone can get that fixed up for you in no time. \nRAMONE Yeah, sure thing. No problemo. Just let me go get my tools. \nHOLLEY Oh no no. I'm keeping that dent. It's way too valuable. \nMater takes this in. \nLIZZIE A \"valuable\" dent? Oh, she's as crazy as Mater. \nMACK Those two are perfect for each other. \nMCQUEEN You know, there's one thing I still don't get. The bad guys hit me with the beam from the camera, right? So why didn't I, you know... \nMATER Explode in a fiery inferno? \nMCQUEEN Yeah. \nFINN We couldn't figure that one out either. \nHOLLEY Our investigation proved that Allinol was actually gasoline. And Miles Axlerod engineered it so that when it got hit by the beam it would explode. \nMCQUEEN Wait a second. Fillmore, you said my fuel was safe. \nMcQueen turns to Fillmore. Everyone does. \nFILLMORE If you're implying that I switched out that rotgut excuse for alternative fuel with my all- natural, sustainable, organic biofuel just because I never trusted Axlerod, you're dead wrong, man. (RE: SARGE) It was him. \nSARGE Once Big Oil, always Big Oil. Man. \nFILLMORE Tree hugger. \nEXT. MAIN STREET - LATER \nA banner says \"Radiator Springs Grand Prix.\" \nSHERIFF rolls up the street. \nSHERIFF The Radiator Springs Grand Prix is about to begin! All spectators clear the starting line! \nMCQUEEN heads up Main Street, other racers following. \n", "test1_input": "CARS 2 \nWRITTEN BY \nBEN QUEEN \nA sleek British sports car talks directly to us in a pixilated, garbled video. He's OUT OF BREATH. Crates are visible behind him. We're in the shadowy bowels of a steel room. \nLELAND TURBO This is Agent Leland Turbo. I have a flash transmission for Agent Finn McMissile. \nSUPERIMPOSE OVER BLACK: WALT DISNEY PICTURES PRESENTS \nLELAND TURBO Finn. My cover's been compromised. Everything's gone pear-shaped. \nSUPERIMPOSE OVER BLACK: A PIXAR ANIMATION STUDIOS FILM \nLELAND TURBO You won't believe what I've found out here. \nHe angles our camera view, reveals a PORTHOLE through which we can see flames rising in the distance. \nLELAND TURBO This is bigger than anything we've ever seen. And no one even knows it exists. Finn, I need backup. But don't call the cavalry - it could blow the operation. And be careful. It's not safe out here! \nANGRY VOICES O.S.

SOMEWHERE IN THE NORTH PACIFIC - NIGHT \nA TINY CRAB BOAT (CRABBY) crests over massive swells. \nCRABBY Alright buddy, we're here. Right where you paid me to bring you. Question is, why? \nA metallic blue sports car, circa the `60s, emerges from the \nshadows. Cagey, smooth, he'd turn heads driving through any intersection in the world. Meet FINN MCMISSILE. \nFINN I'm looking for a car. \nCRABBY A car? Hey pal, you can't get any further away from land than out here. \nFINN Exactly where I want to be. \nCRABBY Well I got news for you, buddy. There's nobody out here but us. \nSuddenly, a HORN -- a COMBAT SHIP, the size of most cruise ships. FINN quickly backs into the shadows, out of sight. \nCOMBAT SHIP What are you doing out here? \nCRABBY What does it look like, genius? I'm crabbing! \nCOMBAT SHIP Well turn around and go back where you came from. \nCRABBY Yeah? And who's gonna make me? \nA laser sight hits Crabby between the eyes. \nCRABBY Alright, alright! Don't get your prop in a twist. (as he turns to leave) What a jerk. Sorry, buddy. Looks like it's the end of the line. Buddy? \nON CRABBY'S DECK: Finn is gone. CUT TO: \nFINN - He HANGS off the side of COMBAT SHIP, clandestine. \nWe're with Finn as the ship continues on, cuts through the darkness with purpose. Suddenly small flames appear, perhaps a knot or so away. Then WHOOSH!!! A flame rises above Finn, the ship. It illuminates an OIL DERRICK. \nTHWAP! Finn fires a GRAPPLING HOOK to the derrick and SWINGS toward it. He's going to SLAM into the side with brute force WHEN --- \n--- HIS TIRES sprout a magnetic exoskeleton. He STICKS to the derrick and now DRIVES VERTICALLY UP UP UP... \nFrom this vantage point, hundreds of derricks appear. \nEXT. PLATFORM - OIL DERRICK - MOMENTS LATER \nFinn approaches a loading bay from above, hides. He watches as GREMLINS, PACERS and assorted other cars scurry about. \nFINN (INTO RADIO) Leland Turbo, this is Finn McMissile. I'm at the rally point. Over. \nNo response. \nFINN (INTO RADIO) Leland, it's Finn. Please respond. Over. \nAN ACCESS DOOR OPENS LOUDLY below. A boxy, monacle-wearing German car enters. This is PROFESSOR OTTO ZUNDAPP. \nPROFESSOR ZUNDAPP (in German and English) Too many cars here. Out of my way! \nFINN Professor Zundapp? \nPACER (O.S.) Here it is, Professor. \nZundapp approaches a NOSY PACER who idles next to a CRATE. \nNOSY PACER You wanted to see this before we load it? \nPROFESSOR ZUNDAPP Ah, yes. Very carefully... \nA forklift opens the crate -- inside is a TV CAMERA, packed carefully in foam. Finn SNAPS PHOTOS FURIOUSLY. \nNOSY PACER Oh. A TV camera. What does it actually do? \nPROFESSOR ZUNDAPP This camera is extremely dangerous. \n", "test1_true": "Finn, angling for a better view, FIRES SUSPENSION WIRES --- \n--- which sail clear to the other side of the derrick --- \n--- THOK! They hook tightly onto a steel girder. \nFinn slides out ONTO THE WIRE like an acrobat, then expels another cross-wire for support. \nPROFESSOR ZUNDAPP This is valuable equipment. Make sure it is properly secured for the voyage. \nNOSY PACER You got it. \nFinn LOWERS HIMSELF. He snaps more pictures. \nGREM (O.S.) Hey, Professor Z! \nZundapp turns as a CRANE LOWERS A CAR-SIZED CRATE. GREM and ACER, an orange Gremlin and a green Pacer, flank it. \nGREM This is one of those British spies we told you about. \nACER Yeah. This one we caught sticking his bumper where it didn't belong. \nFinn PRODUCES SEMI-AUTOMATIC GUNS from his side, readies himself for a tag-team spy fight with his buddy Leland. \nPROFESSOR ZUNDAPP Agent Leland Turbo. \nThe crate is lifted, revealing a CRUSHED, CUBED Leland Turbo. \nFinn's eyes go wide. Suddenly --- WHOOOSHHH! Another derrick flame rises behind him, casts a Finn-shaped SHADOW over the Professor. He looks up. \nPROFESSOR ZUNDAPP It's Finn McMissile! He's seen the camera! Kill him!! \nFinn UNLOADS with bullets as he starts to retreat --- He STOPS: \nBAD GUY CARS are waiting for him on the catwalk where he just came from - BLOWTORCHES ready. \nFinn, stuck in midair, notices an angry CRANE. Finn GRINS, having just found his escape. \nTHWAPTHWAPTHWAP!!! Finn releases three of his four cables, swinging, Indiana Jones-style on the last one TOWARD THE CRANE --- \n--- where he lands on its BOOM, drives UP and LAUNCHES OFF IT where he LANDS - MOVING - onto another deck! \nFinn now DRIVES, spraying oil and screeching around corners. A GREMLIN in pursuit hits the oil patch, loses control --- \n--- and PLUMMETS OFF the side of the rig! \nThe Gremlin FALLS... it's like an eternity... \nHe smashes into the water and breaks into a million pieces. \nON FINN - Now set upon by 20 or 30 MORE pursuing cars. He has nowhere to go but UP UP UP a ramp toward the helipad. He spies some GASOLINE BARRELS, fires a SINGLE BULLET which cuts through its leather straps, sending barrels DOWN the ramp, PAST FINN --- \n--- PAST the pursuing CARS --- \n--- to the bottom where they EXPLODE in a CHAIN REACTION back UP THE RAMP, taking out at least 15 CARS! \nON THE HELIPAD - Finn blasts into view, pulls to a stop. No more road. Nowhere else to go. \nThe 20 BAD GUY CARS that are still in pursuit surround him, fire up their blowtorches. About to pounce. \nFinn GRINS. The second time we've seen this grin. It means he's got something cooking. \nFinn's REVERSE LIGHTS appear. He DRIVES BACKWARD off the edge of the helipad to the SHOCK of the other cars. \nFinn falls. He turns himself so he's grill first, cleanly cutting into the water. \nHe EMERGES, now sprouting HYDROFOIL and speeds away. \nGREM (NONPLUSSED) Get to the boats. \nTHE BOATS - an army of combat ships quickly DROP into the sea and CHURN WATER with unprecedented fury as they quickly make up the distance between them and Finn, FIRING BULLETS as they do so. \nACER He's getting away! \nCOMBAT SHIP Not for long. \nThe LEAD COMBAT SHIP quietly drops a TORPEDO into the water. It skips along, connecting with Finn in his rear and EXPLODING with such force that water skyrockets into the night clouds. \nUNDERWATER - McMissile SINKS. Then, he blinks. He GRINS. We're starting to like this grin and what follows it. He now CONVERTS into a submarine. From his trunk he releases four DECOY tires which float to the surface like body parts. \nON THE DERRICK - Professor Zundapp watches it all from far away. \nGREM (OVER RADIO) He's dead, Professor. \nPROFESSOR ZUNDAPP Wunderbar. With Finn McMissile gone, who can stop us now? \nEXT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - DAY \nTOW MATER, a rusty tow truck, putters into view. \nMATER Mater. Tow Mater, that's who... is here to help you! \nHe approaches a broken-down sedan on the side of the road. He drives around to the front, catching OTIS' face for the first time. \nMATER Hey, Otis! \nOTIS Hey, Mater. Gosh, I'm so sorry. I thought I could make it this time, but... (he tries to start his engine, stalls) Smooth like pudding, huh? Ah, who am I kidding? I'll always be a lemon. \nMater hooks his friend and starts towing him. \nMATER Well dadgum, you're leaking oil again. Must be your gaskets. Hey, look on the bright side: This is your tenth tow this month, so that means it's on the house. \nOTIS You're the only one that's nice to lemons like me, Mater. \n", "test2_input": "BRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.) It's time to find out. The racers are locking into the grid --- \nEngines rev as everyone gets ready to go. Everyone's bright eyed and alert except for McQueen who we find in the back of the grid. He CLOSES his eyes. \nMCQUEEN (TO HIMSELF) Speed. I am speed. \nA LAUGH O.S. McQueen opens his eyes. Francesco is next to him on the grid. \nFRANCESCO Really? You are \"speed\"? Then Francesco is triple speed. (closes his eyes) Francesco. Is. Triple speed. Francesco likes this, McQueen. It's really getting him into the zone! \nMCQUEEN He is so getting beat today. \nThe starting lights click down from RED to YELLOW to GREEN. The race begins. Francesco quickly grabs the lead. He's pulling away within seconds. \nON PIT ROW - We TRACK PAST as the various Crew Chiefs on their crash carts bark orders to their racers. We end on Team McQueen. No Crew Chief, just a solid looking team. \nSARGE His suspension stats look good. \nLUIGI Tire pressure is excellent. \nFILLMORE He's got plenty of fuel. \nMATER And he's awesome! CUT TO: \nThe same view of Mater but now THROUGH A TELESCOPIC DISPLAY. Reveal Finn and Holley watching from high above in a downtown office building, behind reflective glass. \nHOLLEY Why is he in the pits? He's so exposed. \nFINN It's his cover. One of the best I've seen, too. Look at the detail on that rust. It must have cost him a fortune. \nHOLLEY But why hasn't he contacted us yet? \nFINN There's probably heat on him. Be patient. \nHOLLEY Right, of course. He'll signal us when he can. \nFINN And then we find out who's behind all this. \nON THE TRACK - VARIOUS SHOTS OF THE RACE through Tokyo as Francesco extends his lead and McQueen attempts to make up ground. \nIN MCQUEEN'S PIT - Mater watches the monitors, sees them approaching the dirt section. \nMATER McQueen! It's time to make your move. Get on the outside and show 'em what Doc done taught you. \nMCQUEEN (OVER RADIO) Ten four, Mater. \nON THE TRACK - Francesco hits the dirt section and loses all control. He SLAMS to a halt, his tires getting no traction. \nDAVID HOBBSCAP (V.O.) Francesco is brought to a screeching halt! \nMCQUEEN skids into view, turning right to go left, passing Francesco, followed by other cars --- \nBRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.) Lightning McQueen is the first to take advantage. And just like that, folks, Francesco's lead is left in the dust. \nMCQUEEN Nice call, Mater. Keep it up! \nMcQueen now leads the pack, zooming out of the dirt now starting to relax. \nDARRELL CARTRIP (V.O.) Who-hoo! Man, McQueen looks happier than a rollbar at a demolition derby! \nON PAVED ROAD AGAIN - MOMENTS LATER \nThe field of cars thunders into a tunnel. \nBRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.) Everyone's jostling for position as we hit the asphalt again. \nFrancesco crests the hill, in last place. He bites down, determined, then CHASES. \nBRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.) Francesco lost a lot of momentum in the dirt. He's got some serious work ahead of him if he wants to get back in this race. \nVARIOUS SHOTS OF TOKYO as the racers move through the Rainbow Bridge. Bit by bit, Francesco ekes his way toward the front, toward Lightning McQueen as we CUT TO --- \n--- A ROOFTOP, and a VIEW THROUGH THE WGP CAMERA LENS. Grem and Acer are manning this one. They focus it on the racers as they approach. \nPROFESSOR ZUNDAPP (OVER RADIO) It is time. \nGREM Roger that. \nON THE TRACK - A racer (Miguel Camino) suddenly PLUMES WITH SMOKE and skids out. \nDARRELL CARTRIP (V.O.) Oh! Miguel Camino has blown an engine! \nBRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.) Very unusual, Darrell. He's been so consistent all year. \nCamino quickly pits, passing McQueen's pit where Mater is visible. \nON GREM AND ACER, watching from above. \nGREM You gotta be kidding me. \nACER What is it? \nGREM It's that tow truck from the bathroom. \nACER The one from the bathroom? \nGREM Yeah, the one the American Agent passed the device to. \nACER What about him? \nGREM What about him? He's in the pits! \nACER Not for long. \n", "test2_true": "ON FINN AND HOLLEY, still in their office hideaway. Holley's onboard computer flashes an ALERT. \nHOLLEY Hold on. I think I've got something. \nFINN What is it? \nHOLLEY The Pacer from the party last night. \nShe's spotted Acer, moving swiftly forward. \nHOLLEY Cross-referencing with the photos from the oil derricks... Yep. His VIN numbers match. \nFINN Anyone with him? He won't be alone. \nHOLLEY Conducting analysis on the target. \nThe computer finds more and more bad guy Pacers and Gremlins are in the crowd. \nHOLLEY He's not the only one here. Three... five... they're everywhere. And they're all closing in on... oh no. \nWe PAN OVER to see it's MATER. \nHOLLEY Finn? Finn, where are you? \nShe turns. He's GONE, leaving only an open window. \nFINN (OVER RADIO) Get him out of the pits now! \nIN MCQUEEN'S PIT. A car WHIPS BY O.S. \nMATER Wow! Some of them fellers is really loud. \nHOLLEY (OVER MATER'S RADIO) Can you hear me? Over. \nMATER Uh, what? \nHOLLEY (OVER MATER'S RADIO) Get out of the pit now. Do you hear me? \nMater realizes this girl has somehow broken into his radio. \nMATER (INTO RADIO) Hey, I know you. You're that girl from the party last night. You wanna do our date right now? \nON THE TRACK - McQueen boxes out Francesco, holds his slim lead, but barely. \nMCQUEEN Guys, a little too much chatter. Let's keep this line clear. \nBOOM! A racer behind McQueen suddenly expels black smoke, skids out of control. \nON GREM - laughing. That was clearly his handiwork. \nIN MCQUEEN'S PIT - SAME \nHOLLEY (ON MATER'S RADIO) There's no time for messing about. You've got to get out of the pits. \nMATER Is there gonna be cable where you is so I can watch the rest of the race? \nON HOLLEY - Watching from the downtown building. \nHOLLEY (INTO RADIO) You're running out of time! \nFINN (OVER RADIO) They're coming, Shiftwell. \nHOLLEY (INTO RADIO) Yes, I know. \nFINN (OVER RADIO) Get him out of there. \nHOLLEY (TO FINN) I'm trying. (TO MATER) Get out now! \nWe CUT BACK TO --- \n--- MATER. He gives in, exits the pit. \nMATER Well, all right but I usually like to have a proper detailing done before I meet a lady friend. \nHe moves toward the back PIT DOOR, is about to open it. \nOUTSIDE THE PITS - ACER and another Pacer approach McQueen's pit door on the other side. Ready to pounce. The doors OPEN, REVEALING --- \n--- Finn, holding a fire extinguisher. \nACER Finn McMissile? But you're dead! \nFINN Then this shouldn't hurt at all. \nHe empties the extinguisher in their eyes, speeds past. They try and follow, but have been blinded. One of them crashes right into a COP. \nON FINN - Already on the move, along a side street. \nFINN Miss Shiftwell? \nON HOLLEY - Tracking everything on a grid map. Mater looks like Pac Man, weaving through the streets as bad guys close in all around him. \nHOLLEY I've got him in the back alleys east of the garages. Multiple assailants are closing in quickly. \nFINN (OVER RADIO) Keep him moving. I'm on my way. \nON MATER - He turns a corner, sees a flower shop. \nMATER Hey, new lady friend? You like flowers? \nON THE TRACK - McQueen, hearing this, is taken aback. \nMCQUEEN What? \n", "test3_input": "Finn HOOKS Mater from behind. He YANKS HIM forward --- \nFINN I've taken care of that. Hang on. \n--- and LEAPS OUT THE WINDOW! \nEXT. TARMAC - AIRPORT - JAPAN \nFinn pulls Mater down HARD onto the tarmac, towing him away from the terminal. \nMATER This is First Class service. You don't even have to go through the terminal. \nACER and GREM appear, chasing them. Mater, who is facing backward as he is being pulled along, faces them. They're about a hundred yards back. \nMATER (TO FINN) Your karate partners are back here. They kinda look like they're trying to catch up! \nFINN Drive forward. Whatever you do, don't stop. \nFinn SKIDS around, whipping Mater in a 180 so that Mater is now towing Finn. \nGrem produces a ROCKET, lines up Finn as his target. \nFinn, without hesitation, fires a MINI ROLLING-JACK. The jack DRIVES ITSELF toward Grem, anchors itself under his frame and flips him like a turtle but not before Grem gets the rocket OFF --- \nTHE ROCKET - it flies toward Mater and Finn. \nFINN aims and launches a MISSILE back. \nTHE ROCKET AND MISSILE COLLIDE IN MID-AIR, EXPLODE. \nMATER (only hearing this) Is everything okay back there? \nSIDDELEY (O.S.) Finn, it's Sid. I'm on approach. \nA GULFSTREAM JET wings into view overhead. This is SIDDELEY. \nFINN Roger that. \nMater looks up: ACER screeches into view up ahead, dragging a long row of luggage carts in Mater's path, attempting to create an accident. \nMATER (TO FINN) You remember that whole thing about me not stopping no matter what? \nJust as it looks dire --- RATATATATATATAT!!! SIDDELEY descends, hawklike, fires bullets and blows the luggage carts sky-high. Mater and Finn burst through them, luggage now raining down from above. \nMATER I knew I should've done carry-on! \nFINN (TO SIDDELEY) Thanks, old boy! \nSiddeley LANDS HARD on the tarmac ahead of them. No time to stop, he DROPS his back open, revealing HOLLEY. \nMATER Hey, doggone it. It's my imaginary girlfriend! \nHOLLEY Come on! Get in here! \nMater SPEEDS UP toward Siddeley's ramp, Holley. \nMATER (TO HOLLEY) Boy I tell you what, you really do want this first date, don't ya? That's a no-quit attitude right there. \nJust as Mater's wheels touch the ramp, BULLETS PING around him in a spray. Siddeley is HIT, a tire BLOWN. He yells in pain. \nFINN Hold on, Sid! \nSiddeley peels off the runway onto the grass. \nA gunfight ensues between Finn and Acer. Finn SHOOTS ACER'S TIRE, blowing it and throwing him off-course. \nAcer CAREENS out of control, drives up and THROUGH A JET --- \n--- OUT THE OTHER SIDE where he lands in an oil tanker. \nON SIDDELEY - He's headed toward the edge of the tarmac, where the grass and runway meet WATER. He HITS THE GAS, his only hope. \nSIDDELEY Finn, it's now or never! \nFinn BRAKES, 180s and grabs the ramp just as Siddeley gets air. \nSIDDELEY Hold on! \nMater, the only thing not in the jet, dangles and recedes from our view as Siddeley climbs toward the clouds.

LOBBY - HOTEL - TOKYO - DAY \nCLOSE ON a handwritten (er, tire-written?) NOTE in childish scrawl. We don't see all of it, only a bit. Mater's voice O.S. begins the note with the first sentence, but we DISSOLVE into McQueen's voice. \nMCQUEEN \"I'm so sorry for what I did. I don't want to be the cause of you losing any more races. I want you to go prove to the world what I already know - that you are the greatest race car in the whole wide world.

Please tell the hotel I didn't mean to order that movie. I thought it was just a preview and I didn't realize I was paying for it. P.P.S...

That was --- \nWith a ROBOTIC ARM, Holley grabs the THE DEVICE that Rod Redline hid under Mater. She yanks it out with a GOOSE. \nMATER (JUMPS) Yow! \nHOLLEY Still in one piece, great. \nHolley drops the device into a mainframe computer. It starts \"ANALYZING.\" \nMATER I gotta go to a doctor. I keep getting these sharp pains in my undercarriage. \nHOLLEY Downloading the photo now. \nMATER Hey, lemme introduce you two. (TO HOLLEY) This here is Finn McSomething-or- other. He's a First Class VIP airport whatchamacallit. And Finn, this here's my date. (TO HOLLEY) I never did get your name. \nHOLLEY Oh yes, sorry. It's Shiftwell. Holley Shiftwell. \nMATER (TO FINN) It's Shiftwell. Holley --- \nDING! The computer is done analyzing. The cabin lights dim. \nFINN Finally. Time to see who's behind all this. \nAN IMAGE is blasted between the three of them. It's of a photograph, a complicated melange of metallic parts stuck together. \nHOLLEY (to Mater, expectantly) What is this? \nMATER Well, that's one of the worst engines ever made. It's an old aluminum V8 with a Lucas electrical system and Whitworth bolts. Shoot, them Whitworth bolts is a pain, tell you what. Them ain't metric, they ain't inches... \nHOLLEY Yes, OK, right. But who's engine is this, Mater? \nMATER Well, it's kinda hard to tell from this picture, ain't it? \nHOLLEY But you're the one who took it. \nFINN Holley. \nHOLLEY Oh, right. Yes, of course. \"A good agent gets what he can, then gets out before he's killed.\" Sorry. \nMATER Agent? You mean like insurance agent, like, (SINGS) `Like a good neighbor, Mater is there'? Wait, you mean secret agents. You guys is spies! \nFINN Holley, in how many makes and models did this type of engine appear? \nHolley has these stats in seconds. Kid's play. \nHOLLEY It was standard in seven models over a 12-year period. At least 35,000 cars were made with this engine. \nMater MOVES HIS SEAT FORWARD, through one part of the hologram so he's face-to-face with Holley. \nMATER You're pretty. \nHOLLEY (ANNOYED) Yes, alright. Thank you. \nMATER And so nice. \nHOLLEY Just pay attention. \nShe moves the engine photo so it's now blocking Mater again. \nFINN This seems like a dead end. If there were something in the photo that could narrow this down a bit I'd be a lot happier. \nMATER You might not be happy, but I bet this feller is. See how he's had most of his parts replaced? And see all them boxes over there? Them's all original parts. They ain't easy to come by. \nHOLLEY Rare parts. \nFINN That's something we can track. \nHOLLEY Exactly! \nHolley drops her screen down. \nFINN Well done, Mater! I would never have seen that. (TO HOLLEY) I know of a black-market parts dealer in Paris, a treacherous lowlife. But, he's the only car in the world who can tell us whose engine this is. Mater, what would you say to setting up an informal task force on this one? \nMATER Wait, what? \nFINN You obviously have plenty of experience in the field. \nMATER Well yeah I live right next to one. (thinks about it) I don't know, Finn. I ain't exactly been much help to anybody recently. \nFINN You're helping me. Please, Mater. \nMATER Well, okay. But you know I'm just a tow truck, right? \nFINN Right. And I'm just in the import/export business. Siddeley? \nSIDDELEY Yes, Finn? \nFINN Paris. Tout de suite. \nMATER Yeah, two of them sweets for me too, Sid! (TO HOLLEY) You know, I always wanted to be a spy. \nHOLLEY (SMILING SWEETLY) Really?

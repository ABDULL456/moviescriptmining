{"test1_input": "CARS 2 \nWRITTEN BY \nBEN QUEEN \nA sleek British sports car talks directly to us in a pixilated, garbled video. He's OUT OF BREATH. Crates are visible behind him. We're in the shadowy bowels of a steel room. \nLELAND TURBO This is Agent Leland Turbo. I have a flash transmission for Agent Finn McMissile. \nSUPERIMPOSE OVER BLACK: WALT DISNEY PICTURES PRESENTS \nLELAND TURBO Finn. My cover's been compromised. Everything's gone pear-shaped. \nSUPERIMPOSE OVER BLACK: A PIXAR ANIMATION STUDIOS FILM \nLELAND TURBO You won't believe what I've found out here. \nHe angles our camera view, reveals a PORTHOLE through which we can see flames rising in the distance. \nLELAND TURBO This is bigger than anything we've ever seen. And no one even knows it exists. Finn, I need backup. But don't call the cavalry - it could blow the operation. And be careful. It's not safe out here! \nANGRY VOICES O.S. Time for Turbo to go. \nLELAND TURBO Transmitting my grids now. Good luck! \nCoordinates appear: 40 6.80' N - 172 23.84' W \nTITLE CARD: CARS 2 \nEXT. SOMEWHERE IN THE NORTH PACIFIC - NIGHT \nA TINY CRAB BOAT (CRABBY) crests over massive swells. \nCRABBY Alright buddy, we're here. Right where you paid me to bring you. Question is, why? \nA metallic blue sports car, circa the `60s, emerges from the \nshadows. Cagey, smooth, he'd turn heads driving through any intersection in the world. Meet FINN MCMISSILE. \nFINN I'm looking for a car. \nCRABBY A car? Hey pal, you can't get any further away from land than out here. \nFINN Exactly where I want to be. \nCRABBY Well I got news for you, buddy. There's nobody out here but us. \nSuddenly, a HORN -- a COMBAT SHIP, the size of most cruise ships. FINN quickly backs into the shadows, out of sight. \nCOMBAT SHIP What are you doing out here? \nCRABBY What does it look like, genius? I'm crabbing! \nCOMBAT SHIP Well turn around and go back where you came from. \nCRABBY Yeah? And who's gonna make me? \nA laser sight hits Crabby between the eyes. \nCRABBY Alright, alright! Don't get your prop in a twist. (as he turns to leave) What a jerk. Sorry, buddy. Looks like it's the end of the line. Buddy? \nON CRABBY'S DECK: Finn is gone. CUT TO: \nFINN - He HANGS off the side of COMBAT SHIP, clandestine. \nWe're with Finn as the ship continues on, cuts through the darkness with purpose. Suddenly small flames appear, perhaps a knot or so away. Then WHOOSH!!! A flame rises above Finn, the ship. It illuminates an OIL DERRICK. \nTHWAP! Finn fires a GRAPPLING HOOK to the derrick and SWINGS toward it. He's going to SLAM into the side with brute force WHEN --- \n--- HIS TIRES sprout a magnetic exoskeleton. He STICKS to the derrick and now DRIVES VERTICALLY UP UP UP... \nFrom this vantage point, hundreds of derricks appear. \nEXT. PLATFORM - OIL DERRICK - MOMENTS LATER \nFinn approaches a loading bay from above, hides. He watches as GREMLINS, PACERS and assorted other cars scurry about. \nFINN (INTO RADIO) Leland Turbo, this is Finn McMissile. I'm at the rally point. Over. \nNo response. \nFINN (INTO RADIO) Leland, it's Finn. Please respond. Over. \nAN ACCESS DOOR OPENS LOUDLY below. A boxy, monacle-wearing German car enters. This is PROFESSOR OTTO ZUNDAPP. \nPROFESSOR ZUNDAPP (in German and English) Too many cars here. Out of my way! \nFINN Professor Zundapp? \nPACER (O.S.) Here it is, Professor. \nZundapp approaches a NOSY PACER who idles next to a CRATE. \nNOSY PACER You wanted to see this before we load it? \nPROFESSOR ZUNDAPP Ah, yes. Very carefully... \nA forklift opens the crate -- inside is a TV CAMERA, packed carefully in foam. Finn SNAPS PHOTOS FURIOUSLY. \nNOSY PACER Oh. A TV camera. What does it actually do? \nPROFESSOR ZUNDAPP This camera is extremely dangerous. \n", "test1_true": "Finn, angling for a better view, FIRES SUSPENSION WIRES --- \n--- which sail clear to the other side of the derrick --- \n--- THOK! They hook tightly onto a steel girder. \nFinn slides out ONTO THE WIRE like an acrobat, then expels another cross-wire for support. \nPROFESSOR ZUNDAPP This is valuable equipment. Make sure it is properly secured for the voyage. \nNOSY PACER You got it. \nFinn LOWERS HIMSELF. He snaps more pictures. \nGREM (O.S.) Hey, Professor Z! \nZundapp turns as a CRANE LOWERS A CAR-SIZED CRATE. GREM and ACER, an orange Gremlin and a green Pacer, flank it. \nGREM This is one of those British spies we told you about. \nACER Yeah. This one we caught sticking his bumper where it didn't belong. \nFinn PRODUCES SEMI-AUTOMATIC GUNS from his side, readies himself for a tag-team spy fight with his buddy Leland. \nPROFESSOR ZUNDAPP Agent Leland Turbo. \nThe crate is lifted, revealing a CRUSHED, CUBED Leland Turbo. \nFinn's eyes go wide. Suddenly --- WHOOOSHHH! Another derrick flame rises behind him, casts a Finn-shaped SHADOW over the Professor. He looks up. \nPROFESSOR ZUNDAPP It's Finn McMissile! He's seen the camera! Kill him!! \nFinn UNLOADS with bullets as he starts to retreat --- He STOPS: \nBAD GUY CARS are waiting for him on the catwalk where he just came from - BLOWTORCHES ready. \nFinn, stuck in midair, notices an angry CRANE. Finn GRINS, having just found his escape. \nTHWAPTHWAPTHWAP!!! Finn releases three of his four cables, swinging, Indiana Jones-style on the last one TOWARD THE CRANE --- \n--- where he lands on its BOOM, drives UP and LAUNCHES OFF IT where he LANDS - MOVING - onto another deck! \nFinn now DRIVES, spraying oil and screeching around corners. A GREMLIN in pursuit hits the oil patch, loses control --- \n--- and PLUMMETS OFF the side of the rig! \nThe Gremlin FALLS... it's like an eternity... \nHe smashes into the water and breaks into a million pieces. \nON FINN - Now set upon by 20 or 30 MORE pursuing cars. He has nowhere to go but UP UP UP a ramp toward the helipad. He spies some GASOLINE BARRELS, fires a SINGLE BULLET which cuts through its leather straps, sending barrels DOWN the ramp, PAST FINN --- \n--- PAST the pursuing CARS --- \n--- to the bottom where they EXPLODE in a CHAIN REACTION back UP THE RAMP, taking out at least 15 CARS! \nON THE HELIPAD - Finn blasts into view, pulls to a stop. No more road. Nowhere else to go. \nThe 20 BAD GUY CARS that are still in pursuit surround him, fire up their blowtorches. About to pounce. \nFinn GRINS. The second time we've seen this grin. It means he's got something cooking. \nFinn's REVERSE LIGHTS appear. He DRIVES BACKWARD off the edge of the helipad to the SHOCK of the other cars. \nFinn falls. He turns himself so he's grill first, cleanly cutting into the water. \nHe EMERGES, now sprouting HYDROFOIL and speeds away. \nGREM (NONPLUSSED) Get to the boats. \nTHE BOATS - an army of combat ships quickly DROP into the sea and CHURN WATER with unprecedented fury as they quickly make up the distance between them and Finn, FIRING BULLETS as they do so. \nACER He's getting away! \nCOMBAT SHIP Not for long. \nThe LEAD COMBAT SHIP quietly drops a TORPEDO into the water. It skips along, connecting with Finn in his rear and EXPLODING with such force that water skyrockets into the night clouds. \nUNDERWATER - McMissile SINKS. Then, he blinks. He GRINS. We're starting to like this grin and what follows it. He now CONVERTS into a submarine. From his trunk he releases four DECOY tires which float to the surface like body parts. \nON THE DERRICK - Professor Zundapp watches it all from far away. \nGREM (OVER RADIO) He's dead, Professor. \nPROFESSOR ZUNDAPP Wunderbar. With Finn McMissile gone, who can stop us now? \nEXT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - DAY \nTOW MATER, a rusty tow truck, putters into view. \nMATER Mater. Tow Mater, that's who... is here to help you! \nHe approaches a broken-down sedan on the side of the road. He drives around to the front, catching OTIS' face for the first time. \nMATER Hey, Otis! \nOTIS Hey, Mater. Gosh, I'm so sorry. I thought I could make it this time, but... (he tries to start his engine, stalls) Smooth like pudding, huh? Ah, who am I kidding? I'll always be a lemon. \nMater hooks his friend and starts towing him. \nMATER Well dadgum, you're leaking oil again. Must be your gaskets. Hey, look on the bright side: This is your tenth tow this month, so that means it's on the house. \nOTIS You're the only one that's nice to lemons like me, Mater. \n", "test1_id": 1182, "test2_input": "MATER Oh, same ol', same ol'. What's up with you? That looks delicious. \nThe chef starts to carve a small scoop aside for Mater. \nMATER Uh, a little more, please. It is free, right? (the chef adds more) Keep it coming. A little more. Come on, let's go, it's free! You're getting there... Scoop scoop! \nThe chef gives in. Scoops a baseball-sized ball out. \nMATER There you go. Now THAT's a scoop of ice cream. \nSUSHI CHEF (in Japanese, subtitles) My condolences. CUT BACK TO: \nMILES AXLEROD - He's now nearly done with his intros. \nMILES AXLEROD ... and now, our last competitor --- Number 95, Lightning McQueen! \nMCQUEEN approaches the microphone, flashes his headlights. \nMCQUEEN Thank you so much for having us, Sir Axlerod. I really look forward to racing. This is a great opportunity. \nMILES AXLEROD Oh, the pleasure is all ours, Lightning. You and your team bring excellence and professionalism to this competition. \nAs if on cue, Mater arrives with a piercing scream of pain. Everyone turns as he charges head first toward the stage, making a bee-line for that FOUNTAIN. \nMATER Somebody get me water! \nHe laps up water from the fountain like a diabetic cat. \nMATER (LAPPING WATER) Sweet relief... \nMiles Axlerod is shocked. The crowd can't believe it. Francesco cackles. Mater, now sated, approaches the mic. \nMATER (to the crowd) Whatever you do, do not eat the free pistachio ice cream. It has turned! \nMCQUEEN Sir Axlerod, I can explain. This is Mater. \nMILES AXLEROD I know him. This is the bloke that called into the television show. (TO MATER) You're the one I have to thank. \nMATER No, thank you. This trip's been amazing. \nMILES AXLEROD (TO MCQUEEN) He's a little excited, isn't he? \nTILT DOWN to reveal a pool of oil beneath Mater. \nMCQUEEN Mater! \nMATER But wait, I... oh, shoot. \nMcQueen quickly pulls Mater aside, out of earshot of Miles Axlerod and the others. McQueen is beside himself. \nMCQUEEN Mater, you have to get a hold of yourself. You're making a scene. \nMATER But I never leak oil. Never. \nMCQUEEN Go take care of yourself right now. \nMater drives off. \nON MATER - MOMENTS LATER \nHe drives through the party, frantic. \nMATER Coming through! Excuse me, leakin' oil. Where's the bathroom? Thank you. I gotta go! \nSomeone points Mater down a hallway. He whips around the CORNER --- \n--- and STOPS. Finds himself in front of TWO BATHROOM DOORS, neither of which clearly indicate MALE or FEMALE. \nMATER (CONFUSED) What the... \nMater chooses one, drives inside. A SHRIEK is heard and Mater zips out. \nMATER Sorry ladies! \nHe heads into the other door --- CUT TO: \nINT. MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT \nMater rolls in, still `holding it in' like a kid. \nMATER I never leak I never leak I never leak... \nHe sees someone leaving a stall. He heads in. \nIN THE STALL - Mater enters, looks up. \nMATER Wowee... \nThe stall is a complicated apparatus with buttons and lights. High-tech Japanese. It suddenly GRABS MATER, hoists him up as if he's going to get an oil change. \nMATER What in the--- \nA Japanese style cartoon CARICATURE appears on a TV MONITOR, followed by images of waterfalls and rivers. \nMATER (GIGGLING) Hey, that tickles. \nThe caricature starts talking in Japanese. Suddenly WATER FIRES UP underneath Mater's undercarriage, goosing him. He freaks out. \nOUTSIDE THE STALL - With Mater's yells audible we see a GREMLIN enter, furtive. Suddenly, inexplicably, his frame BREAKS APART like an egg, revealing an AMERICAN MUSCLE CAR underneath. The pieces of the Gremlin disappear under him, clearly his disguise. This is ROD REDLINE - American Agent. \nROD REDLINE Okay, McMissile. I'm here. It's time for the drop. \nINT. PARTY - SAME \n", "test2_true": "HOLLEY (INTO RADIO) The American has activated his tracking beacon. \nFINN (OVER RADIO) Roger that. Move in. \nINT. BATHROOM - SAME \nRod Redline, waiting at a sink, feels a presence behind him. \nGREM and ACER have entered, hesitate briefly when they see Rod Redline. \nRod Redline, careful, slides a gun out of his tire. He is suddenly CHARGED by the AMCs --- Rod SPINS AROUND and gets a shot off but is SLAMMED HEAD FIRST. A TIGHT, CLOSE-QUARTERS FIGHT begins --- \nIN THE STALL - Mater, still TRAPPED, is now being SCRUBBED as if in a car wash. He is helpless. \nOUTSIDE THE STALL - Rod is being pulverized. Just when he scrambles away from one car, the other one takes over. \nIN THE STALL - Mater is mercifully released, but when he backs out --- \n--- Rod Redline is THROWN INTO MATER'S STALL DOOR, crunching it and sending Mater --- \n--- BACK INTO THE CLUTCHES of the insane toilet. \nINT. PARTY - SAME \nHolley isolates the tracking beacon's location in the party. \nHOLLEY Oh, you've got to be joking. \nFINN What's the problem, Shiftwell? \nHOLLEY He's in the loo. \nFINN So go in! \nHOLLEY I can't just go into the men's loo. \nFINN Time is of the essence, Shiftwell. \nINT. BATHROOM - OUTSIDE THE STALL \nRod Redline is in bad shape. He backs away, betrays a look of concern. He's in trouble here. \nACER burns rubber, ready to finish him off. Just as he shifts into DRIVE --- \n--- MATER'S STALL DOOR KICKS OPEN, knocking ACER out. Mater jumps out, face-to-face GREM. \nMATER (out of breath) Whatever you do, I would not go in there. \nThe door SWINGS shut, revealing the pulverized Acer. \nMATER A Gremlin and a Pacer! \nRod Redline, now behind Mater and sensing an opportunity here, quickly produces A SMALL DEVICE. \nMATER (to Grem and Acer) No offense to your makes and models, but you guys break down harder than my cousin Betsy after she got left at the --- \nRod Redline, surreptitiously attaches the device to Mater's undercarriage. \nMATER (as he's goosed) --- altar! \nHe spins around, sees Rod Redline for the first time. \nMATER Are you okay? \nROD REDLINE I'm fine. \nGREM Hey. Tow truck. \nMater turns back to Grem and Acer. \nGREM We'd like to get to our private business here, if you don't mind. \nMATER Oh, yeah. Don't let me get in the way of your \"private business.\" Oh! A little advice: When you hear her giggle and see that waterfall, you best press that green button. \nGREM Thank you. \nMATER It's to adjust the temperature. \nACER Got it. \nMATER Remember it's in Celsius, not Fahrenheit. \nGREM AND ACER Get outta here! \nMATER Alright then. \nMater exits, leaving Rod Redline to a now even angrier Grem and Acer. \nEXT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nHolley arrives at the door. She takes a breath, is about to enter when Mater EXITS. \nMATER Excuse me, ma'am. \nHe passes her, expelling some exhaust in the process. Holley's rearview tracking confirms that the device is on him. \nMATER (TO HIMSELF) Dadgum pistachio ice cream. \nHOLLEY (INTO RADIO) This cannot be him. \nFINN (OVER RADIO) Is he American? \nMATER (driving off, to himself) Look out, ladies. Mater's fittin' to get funky! \n", "test2_id": 1183, "test3_input": "Finn HOOKS Mater from behind. He YANKS HIM forward --- \nFINN I've taken care of that. Hang on. \n--- and LEAPS OUT THE WINDOW! \nEXT. TARMAC - AIRPORT - JAPAN \nFinn pulls Mater down HARD onto the tarmac, towing him away from the terminal. \nMATER This is First Class service. You don't even have to go through the terminal. \nACER and GREM appear, chasing them. Mater, who is facing backward as he is being pulled along, faces them. They're about a hundred yards back. \nMATER (TO FINN) Your karate partners are back here. They kinda look like they're trying to catch up! \nFINN Drive forward. Whatever you do, don't stop. \nFinn SKIDS around, whipping Mater in a 180 so that Mater is now towing Finn. \nGrem produces a ROCKET, lines up Finn as his target. \nFinn, without hesitation, fires a MINI ROLLING-JACK. The jack DRIVES ITSELF toward Grem, anchors itself under his frame and flips him like a turtle but not before Grem gets the rocket OFF --- \nTHE ROCKET - it flies toward Mater and Finn. \nFINN aims and launches a MISSILE back. \nTHE ROCKET AND MISSILE COLLIDE IN MID-AIR, EXPLODE. \nMATER (only hearing this) Is everything okay back there? \nSIDDELEY (O.S.) Finn, it's Sid. I'm on approach. \nA GULFSTREAM JET wings into view overhead. This is SIDDELEY. \nFINN Roger that. \nMater looks up: ACER screeches into view up ahead, dragging a long row of luggage carts in Mater's path, attempting to create an accident. \nMATER (TO FINN) You remember that whole thing about me not stopping no matter what? \nJust as it looks dire --- RATATATATATATAT!!! SIDDELEY descends, hawklike, fires bullets and blows the luggage carts sky-high. Mater and Finn burst through them, luggage now raining down from above. \nMATER I knew I should've done carry-on! \nFINN (TO SIDDELEY) Thanks, old boy! \nSiddeley LANDS HARD on the tarmac ahead of them. No time to stop, he DROPS his back open, revealing HOLLEY. \nMATER Hey, doggone it. It's my imaginary girlfriend! \nHOLLEY Come on! Get in here! \nMater SPEEDS UP toward Siddeley's ramp, Holley. \nMATER (TO HOLLEY) Boy I tell you what, you really do want this first date, don't ya? That's a no-quit attitude right there. \nJust as Mater's wheels touch the ramp, BULLETS PING around him in a spray. Siddeley is HIT, a tire BLOWN. He yells in pain. \nFINN Hold on, Sid! \nSiddeley peels off the runway onto the grass. \nA gunfight ensues between Finn and Acer. Finn SHOOTS ACER'S TIRE, blowing it and throwing him off-course. \nAcer CAREENS out of control, drives up and THROUGH A JET --- \n--- OUT THE OTHER SIDE where he lands in an oil tanker. \nON SIDDELEY - He's headed toward the edge of the tarmac, where the grass and runway meet WATER. He HITS THE GAS, his only hope. \nSIDDELEY Finn, it's now or never! \nFinn BRAKES, 180s and grabs the ramp just as Siddeley gets air. \nSIDDELEY Hold on! \nMater, the only thing not in the jet, dangles and recedes from our view as Siddeley climbs toward the clouds. As he's PULLED in through the back hatch: \nMATER (V.O.) By the time you read this, I will be safely on an airplane, flying home. \nINT. LOBBY - HOTEL - TOKYO - DAY \nCLOSE ON a handwritten (er, tire-written?) NOTE in childish scrawl. We don't see all of it, only a bit. Mater's voice O.S. begins the note with the first sentence, but we DISSOLVE into McQueen's voice. \nMCQUEEN \"I'm so sorry for what I did. I don't want to be the cause of you losing any more races. I want you to go prove to the world what I already know - that you are the greatest race car in the whole wide world. Your best friend, Mater.\" \nMcQueen takes this in. \nMCQUEEN I didn't really want him to leave. \nLUIGI Wait, there's more here. (READS) \"P.S. Please tell the hotel I didn't mean to order that movie. I thought it was just a preview and I didn't realize I was paying for it. P.P.S... That's funny right there -- PP.\" (to the others) There's a few more pages of P.S.'s here. \nMCQUEEN (TURNING BACK) Well, at least I know if he's at home he'll be safe. \nEXT. SKY - DAY \nSIDDELEY breaks through some cloud cover, flies with purpose. \nINT. JET - DAY \nA well-appointed spy jet. Various computers line the walls. \n", "test3_true": "HOLLEY (SCANNING MATER) I hope that device didn't fall off. \nMATER That's the closest I ever been to missing my flight! That was --- \nWith a ROBOTIC ARM, Holley grabs the THE DEVICE that Rod Redline hid under Mater. She yanks it out with a GOOSE. \nMATER (JUMPS) Yow! \nHOLLEY Still in one piece, great. \nHolley drops the device into a mainframe computer. It starts \"ANALYZING.\" \nMATER I gotta go to a doctor. I keep getting these sharp pains in my undercarriage. \nHOLLEY Downloading the photo now. \nMATER Hey, lemme introduce you two. (TO HOLLEY) This here is Finn McSomething-or- other. He's a First Class VIP airport whatchamacallit. And Finn, this here's my date. (TO HOLLEY) I never did get your name. \nHOLLEY Oh yes, sorry. It's Shiftwell. Holley Shiftwell. \nMATER (TO FINN) It's Shiftwell. Holley --- \nDING! The computer is done analyzing. The cabin lights dim. \nFINN Finally. Time to see who's behind all this. \nAN IMAGE is blasted between the three of them. It's of a photograph, a complicated melange of metallic parts stuck together. \nHOLLEY (to Mater, expectantly) What is this? \nMATER Well, that's one of the worst engines ever made. It's an old aluminum V8 with a Lucas electrical system and Whitworth bolts. Shoot, them Whitworth bolts is a pain, tell you what. Them ain't metric, they ain't inches... \nHOLLEY Yes, OK, right. But who's engine is this, Mater? \nMATER Well, it's kinda hard to tell from this picture, ain't it? \nHOLLEY But you're the one who took it. \nFINN Holley. \nHOLLEY Oh, right. Yes, of course. \"A good agent gets what he can, then gets out before he's killed.\" Sorry. \nMATER Agent? You mean like insurance agent, like, (SINGS) `Like a good neighbor, Mater is there'? Wait, you mean secret agents. You guys is spies! \nFINN Holley, in how many makes and models did this type of engine appear? \nHolley has these stats in seconds. Kid's play. \nHOLLEY It was standard in seven models over a 12-year period. At least 35,000 cars were made with this engine. \nMater MOVES HIS SEAT FORWARD, through one part of the hologram so he's face-to-face with Holley. \nMATER You're pretty. \nHOLLEY (ANNOYED) Yes, alright. Thank you. \nMATER And so nice. \nHOLLEY Just pay attention. \nShe moves the engine photo so it's now blocking Mater again. \nFINN This seems like a dead end. If there were something in the photo that could narrow this down a bit I'd be a lot happier. \nMATER You might not be happy, but I bet this feller is. See how he's had most of his parts replaced? And see all them boxes over there? Them's all original parts. They ain't easy to come by. \nHOLLEY Rare parts. \nFINN That's something we can track. \nHOLLEY Exactly! \nHolley drops her screen down. \nFINN Well done, Mater! I would never have seen that. (TO HOLLEY) I know of a black-market parts dealer in Paris, a treacherous lowlife. But, he's the only car in the world who can tell us whose engine this is. Mater, what would you say to setting up an informal task force on this one? \nMATER Wait, what? \nFINN You obviously have plenty of experience in the field. \nMATER Well yeah I live right next to one. (thinks about it) I don't know, Finn. I ain't exactly been much help to anybody recently. \nFINN You're helping me. Please, Mater. \nMATER Well, okay. But you know I'm just a tow truck, right? \nFINN Right. And I'm just in the import/export business. Siddeley? \nSIDDELEY Yes, Finn? \nFINN Paris. Tout de suite. \nMATER Yeah, two of them sweets for me too, Sid! (TO HOLLEY) You know, I always wanted to be a spy. \nHOLLEY (SMILING SWEETLY) Really? Me too. \nSIDDELEY Afterburners, sir? \nFINN Is there any other way? \nEXT. JET - MOVING \nSiddeley HITS THE JUICE, they kick forward like a mule as we CUT TO --- \n", "test3_id": 1184}

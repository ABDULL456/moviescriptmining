There is a feeling of empowerment and release in Herry. His grin splits his round face. His eyes say that his heart is dancing. 
PULL SLOWLY BACK...through the window, past the porch, across the front yard. To a figure. By the fence. He stands motionless. Except his foot is tapping, very slightly, to the time of the music. 
We can't tell how much Quoyle sees.    But his eyes say that his heart is drowning. 
EXT. NUTBEEM'S TRAILER - MORNING 
As Quoyle shuffles up, we see Nutbeem's trailer has been turned completely OVER onto its side. Walls are crushed and splintered. It's a train wreck. 
Sitting on the cinder blocks that once supported it, Nutbeem, and Dennis swig beers. 
NUTBEEM (cheery) You're looking dishy, Q. 
QUOYLE Feeling that and more.    What's the situation? 
Nutbeem hands him a beer. 
NUTBEEM One. You're moving in with Dennis, no matter how fond you are of his wife. 
Quoyle looks sadly at the trailer.    Realizing it was his place that got trashed. 
NUTBEEM (laughs) And the boat! Omigod! 
BILLY I'm some disgusted.    With the human race. 
NUTBEEM I'da never made it, anyway. Storms would have blown me to bits. You boys saved my life. Yes, you did. 
The boys look at each other.    Humiliated by his generosity. 
NUTBEEM 
I've gathered my savings, and am flying to Brazil. Where water is swimming pool green. And I grill yellowtail steaks with lime and garlic, watercress and Tobasco. Touch of curry. What? 
Quoyle is looking at him somewhat strangely. 
QUOYLE (light) I collect friends who cook.     Just can't keep 'em. 
Maybe too light not to be obvious.     Billy looks from Quoyle to the trailer. And back. 
BILLY It's too bad. 
Which seems to cover everything. 
EXT. JACK BUGGIT'S SKIFF - DAY 
Quoyle alone with Jack in open water. Pulling on a slicker, gloves, picking up a knife. Jack is pronging cod onto the deck. 
JACK Hands might as well be movin' while we chat. Always hated th' sight a grown men around a table workin' nuthin' but their jaws. 
And so, together, they begin to clean a small mountain of cod. 
QUOYLE Editorial meetin', y'say.     'Bout what? 
JACK Well, Tert Card's gone, fer one thing. 
Doesn't look up. 
JACK Yar, I know, he never said g'bye. Well, don't get all weepy-eyed about it, old son. Try t'be a man. 
Quoyle will. 
JACK They called him from St. John's, he tells me. Wants him to help put out th' newsletter fer them oil rig suppliers. 
Yup.     Believe it. 
JACK He was sassy an' he was smug. Oh, there's a waitin' list, he assures me. They only skims th' cream. 
QUOYLE Well, don't get all weepy-eyed abou... 
JACK Truth t'tell. I was a wee help. B'hind the scenes, doncha know. 
Keeps working. 
JACK (quietly) Sometimes.     Enough is enough. 
No arguments arise. 
QUOYLE Well, Billy'll do a helluva job... 
JACK (nods) ...right where he is. Too old a fish t'swim faster'n be wants. Gotta find someone a little dumber t'take on a shit job like this! 
Uh-oh.     You don't mean... 
JACK Spot I'm in, Christmas and all. Might have to offer th'mess. To you. 
Quoyle swallows.       Arguably the proudest moment of his life. 
QUOYLE Course.     I'd need a raise. 
Jack looks at him for the first time.        A real twinkle behind... 
JACK Y'know. Yer do have the sense God gave a doughnut. 
QUOYLE (genuinely touched) I'II try to live up to that. 
Said with such sincerity, Jack can only nod.          Good. 
JACK Any other outrageous demands? Seein' as yer got me over a barrel. Here's your one chance. 
And before he can stop his mouth... 
QUOYLE Well, your son... 
The mirth dies in his host's eyes. Like a 60-watt bulb in a brownout. Quoyle swallows the rest.

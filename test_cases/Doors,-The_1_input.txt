JIM ...cause... you're the one... 
He moves. Kisses her swiftly, softly, right on the lips. 
GIRL (mesmerized, awkward) Wow... neat... (looks back) ...maybe you should meet my old man? 
JIM Later. You got a name? 
He looks into her face. Classic American face, freckles, big round eyes soft as rain, long sunset red hair. She feels his intense, starving eyes. He kisses her a second time. 
The YOUNG MAN coming back with the rolling paper -- sees him. 
As he hops back on the railing -- swings out into the tree -- looks back once. 
JIM Mine's Jim. 
A moment. She must decide. The YOUNG MAN within earshot. 
GIRL Pam... 
The ice broken in that instant. Jim smiles. 
JIM Jim and Pam, Pam and Jim... 
He vanishes. The Man abreast of Pamela, as if he's seen a vision. 
YOUNG MAN Who the hell was that? 
PAMELA (everything's cool) That's Jim. My new friend. 
INT. UCLA SCREENING ROOM - DAY (1965) 
On the screen a 16mm black and white student film of a stunning BLOND in black bra, panties, garters dancing in black heels on top of a TV set. panning down to images of goose-stepping Nazis and a Nuremberg rally on the set. Sounds of lovemaking and an Indian peyote ceremony from the track, an Indian holy man incanting... Jim's VOICE comes on the track as well. 
JIM'S VOICE Nietzche said "all great things must first wear monstrous and terrifying masks in order to inscribe themselves on the hearts of humanity". Listen children -- to the sound of the Nuremberg night. 
STUDENTS in the audience groan at the pretention of it. Moving to JIM's eyes hidden in his parka hood, peeking through at the screen. 
A CLOSEUP now of JIM on screen looking straight into the lens as he takes a hit on a hash pipe, and winks. 
JIM VOICE (on screen) Have you ever seen God? -- a mandala. A symmetrical angel. Felt? Yes. Fucking the Sun. Heard? The music. Voices. Touched? An animal. Your hand Tasted? Rare meat, corn, water and wine 
STUDENTS (ad lib) SSSSssss... ego trip man, c'mon! 
RAY MANZAREK, a tall student with powerful voice and manner, thick glasses, long hair sweeping down over his eyes, leans over to Jim. 
RAY Hey man it's great, don't listen to em, it's non-linear man, it's poetry man, everything Godard stands for. 
The lights coming on as the last absurdist images flicker off. Hissing and a big Bronx cheer summarize the feelings of the 100 odd STUDENTS crammed into a bunker-like theater. 
A youngish INSTRUCTOR stirs to the front row from a row of upset FACULTY. Hands shooting up to criticize. 
INSTRUCTOR This is pretty shocking stuff Mr. Morrison. And I might say indulgent. Naziism and masturbation, when used for shock value, are not art. But to be constructive, let's start with your intention. What was it? 
STUDENT 1 It was a bore!! That's what! (laughter) 
TRICK, BONES and JACK, three friends sitting next to Jim, shoot their hands up. 
TRICK Hey it was better'n a Warhol picture. 
GIRL 1 No it wasn't. It was worse! 
TRICK A guy sleeping for seven hours... 
STUDENT 2 ...is less pretentious! There was no political consciousness. Naziism is... 
JACK Hey hold on man! You guys are the facists! 
BONES It takes genitalism to absurdity man, just cause the squares here can't dig it cause the film school's still so square... 
VOICES Oh c'mon man, give it a break. Boo! Beatniks go home! Take another mushroom... 
A cacophony of voices, critics, emotions blend out over Jim's quiet eyes. 
INSTRUCTOR HOLD IT DOWN!!... Mr. Morrison -- what are your feelings? 
JIM I quit. (walks out) 
EXT. TURKEY JOINT WEST - NIGHT 
JIM, BONES, TRICK, JACK approaching the bar. MUSIC of "GLORIA" blasting from the door, CHICKS popping in and out, definitely college crowd circa '65. 
TRICK (to Jim) Hey man whatdya expect, an Oscar? 
BONES You can't quit, you gotta voice. People can't dig cause they don't understand yet. 
JACK If you're an individual, if you're too good, they wanna cut your dick off. Look what happened to Orson Wells. 
TRICK You quit now, they'll yank your deferment in no time and they'll get you for Vietnam man. Three more months you graduate. 
BONES Be cool, you never learned fuckin patience Morrison, you want everything at once. 
NICK They didn't get it. So make your films and fuck what they think. 
JIM You know what I think? 
He slows, a dramatic young lion pose, surveying the girls. 
BONES Yeah whadday you think?

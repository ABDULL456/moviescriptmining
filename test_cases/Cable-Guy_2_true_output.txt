Suddenly they all stop simultaneously, and then the only sound is a miniacle laugh echoing through the garage. 
Steven runs to his car, and gets in. He drives up the ramp in a panic. From out of nowhere the Cable Guy steps into the beam of his headlights. He cannot stop in time. The Cable Guy is thrown into the air, then lands on the back of the roof of the car. Before he falls off he grabs on to the bar of the luggage rack. 
Steven looks through his rear view window and sees the Cable Guy staring at him. 
As Steven continues to drive the Cable Guy climbs on to the roof of the car, then jumps on the hood, and stares at Steven through the windshield. Steven swerves around, almost losing control of the car. 
STEVEN Leave me alone! I have no job, no girlfriend, no family anymore! It's over! You won! 
(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue) 
CABLE GUY (menacingly) Oh no. It's not over. It's just gettin' started. 
He turns a corner very sharply throwing the Cable Guy off his car. The Cable Guy falls to the ground, rolling many times, then leaps to his feet using the momentum of the roll, and runs off, scampering like a supernatural bug.

ON THE TV - The local news. 
MARK THOMPSON The jury has notified the judge that they are very close to reaching a verdict, and would like to keep deliberating into the evening hours. 
Rick is sitting at his desk. A FEMALE RESEARCHER walks over, and sits down. 
RESEARCHER There are five people named Ernie Douglas in this county. Two are African American. One is eighty-five years old. One is eleven years old, and the last one is in a wheelchair. 
RICK So we're nowhere. Ernie Douglas? Ernie Douglas? 
She begins tapping her foot nervously. 
RICK Could you stop that? 
RESEARCHER Don't snap at me. I'm doing this as a favor. 
He continues staring at her two-tone wing tipped style shoe. 
RICK (has an epiphany) Wait, could you start that again? Start tapping your foot again. 
She begins tapping. Rick begins humming the theme to "My Three Sons." She joins him. They sing louder and louder. They've broken the code.

Rick sits at his desk. The researcher is at his side. 
RICK I've got a list of every cable installer fired in the last four years. Every one of these guys has the same physical description as our friend. (reads from the list) Murray Slaughter, Brendan Walsh, Sam Malone, Alex Reiger. There was even a guy who liked to be called 'the big Ragu.'

Steven walks in and looks for the Cable Guy's hidden camera as he speaks on the phone. 
STEVEN Carmine from "Laverne and Shirley." 
RICK That's so sad that you know that. Anyway, the cable company in town fired a guy six months ago named Darren Stevens. He stole the truck and disappeared. That's our guy. 
Steven finds a small camera in one of the television speakers. He rips it out. 
STEVEN So he doesn't even work for the Cable Company?

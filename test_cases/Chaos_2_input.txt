Dekker lowers his head.    Disappointed. 
CONNERS You sure that's what you want? 
GINA Yeah. 
CONNERS Fine. Then it's two phone calls I'll make. The first will be to the public defender's office. The second to children's services. 
GINA What? 
Suddenly Gina's bravado disappears.    Suddenly a scared and lonely girl. 
CONNERS It's simple... if you insist on a lawyer, I take your kids. 
GINA No. 
CONNERS Not like you cared about them anyway. You were ready to fly the coop with "Shit-for-brains."

GINA No.   You can't do that. 
CONNERS I can and I will. 
GINA Don't. 
CONNERS Tell me what I want to know! 
Dekker stares incredulously at Conners. 
GINA (broken) I don't know anything.     Please don't take my kids. Please. 
Conners stares into Gina's eyes. She's telling the truth. Conners wraps his coat around Gina's shoulders. 
CONNERS Get her some coffee...     Something hot. 
84   INT.   BULLPEN - SEATTLE POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY             84 
Dekker and Conners... 
DEKKER You believe her? 
CONNERS I think for the first time in that girl's life she's telling the truth. 
DEKKER You had to know, once she asked for a lawyer anything she told us would have been inadmissable. 
CONNERS Who would've known? It would've been my word against hers. Who do you think the jury would've believed? 
DEKKER Justice by any means.    Even if you cross the line. 
CONNERS The only line around here is the `blue line', you cross that one, then you got (MORE)

CONNERS (cont'd) problems. Ask Callo, he knows what I'm talking about. 
Teddy enters, hands Conners a sheet of paper with: "EVIDENCE: ITEM #4958378" scribbled on it. 
TEDDY Those serial numbers Marnie faxed me... According to our computers, that money should be downstairs. 
85   INT.   EVIDENCE ROOM - SEATTLE POLICE DEPARTMENT                85 
Occupies almost the entire basement of the police station.      A STEEL CAGE protects the contents. 
AT THE FRONT COUNTER-- 
Conners and Dekker wait. No one's working at present. Dekker peers inside, anxiously looking for someone. 
Dekker RINGS the service bell. 
Finally... HARRY HUME, 50's, the cop on watch, limps to the desk. Crotchety, with an overgrown belly, Frank's seen better days. There's no love loss between Harry and Conners. 
CONNERS (cold) Buzz us in. 
HARRY (colder) You gotta sign first. 
Conners and Dekker scribble their signatures down. 
HARRY I heard you were back. Kinda liked not having you around, Conners. 
Harry takes the clipboard, examines it until satisfied.   Then reluctantly BUZZES them in. 
CONNERS Have another donut, Frankie. 
Dekker and Conners proceed inside. They walk ALONG THE VAST ROWS OF EVIDENCE, scan the shelves, checking the number. 
CONNERS That fat fuck is the sole guardian of the city's biggest source of contraband. Drugs. Weapons. Cash. (MORE)

{"test1_input": "Bock looks up, and they suddenly find their eyes locked. The dark, dense air in the room fairly steams with incipient sexuality. \nBOCK (looks down again) You're wasting your time. I've been impotent for years. \nBARBARA Rubbish. \nWith a crash of his fist on the desktop, Bock stands; he is in a drunken rage. \nBOCK (lurches about) What the hell's wrong with being impotent? My God, you kids are more hung up on sex than the Victorians! I've got a son, twenty-three. I threw him out of the house last year. Pietistic little humbug. He preached universal love and despised everyone. He had a blanket contempt for the middle class, even its decencies. He detested my mother because she had petit bourgeois pride in her son the doctor. I cannot tell you how brutishly he ignored that rather good old lady. When she died, he didn't even come to the funeral. He thought the chapel service an hypocrisy. His generation didn't live with lies, he told me. \"Everybody lives with lies,\" I said. I grabbed him by his poncho, dragged him the full length of our seven-room despicably affluent middle-class apartment and flung him out. I haven't seen him since. But do you know what he said to me as he stood there on that landing on the verge of tears. He shrieked at me: \"You old fink! You can't even get it up anymore!\" That was it, you see. That was his real revolution. It wasn't racism and the oppressed poor and the war in Vietnam. The ultimate American societal sickness was a limp dingus. Hah! (he lurches about, laughing rustily) My God, if there is a despised and misunderstood minority in this country, it's us poor impotent bastards. Well, I'm impotent and proud of it! Impotence is beautiful, baby! (he raises a militant fist) Power to the Impotent! Right on, baby! \nBARBARA (smiling) Right on. \nBOCK (stares drunkenly at her) When I say impotent, I don't mean merely limp. Disagreeable as it may be for a woman, a man may sometimes lust for other things, something less transient than an erection, some sense of permanent worth. That's what medicine was for me, my reason for being. When I was thirty-four, Miss Drummond, I presented a paper before the annual convention of the Society of Clinical Investigation that pioneered the whole goddam field of immunology. A breakthrough! I'm in all the textbooks. I happen to be an eminent man, Miss Drummond. And you want to know something, Miss Drummond? I don't give a goddam. When I say I'm impotent, I mean I've lost even my desire for work, which is a hell of a lot more primal a passion than sex. I've lost my raison d'etre, my purpose, the only thing I ever truly loved. It's all rubbish anyway. Transplants, antibodies, we manufacture genes, we can produce birth ectogenetically, we can practically clone people like carrots, and half the kids in this ghetto haven't even been inoculated for polio! We have assembled the most enormous medical establishment ever conceived, and people are sicker than ever! We cure nothing! We heal nothing! The whole goddam wretched world is strangulating in front of our eyes! That's what I mean when I say impotent! You don't know what the hell I'm talking about, do you? \nBARBARA Of course, I do. \nBOCK I'm tired, I'm terribly tired, Miss Drummond. And I hurt, and I've got nothing going for me anymore. Can you understand that? \nBARBARA Yes, of course. \nBOCK Then can you understand that the only admissable matter left is death? \nHe suspects he is going to cry and turns quickly away. He sits heavily and fights his tears. \nBARBARA Sounds to me like a familiar case of morbid menopause. \nBOCK Oh Christ. \nBARBARA Well, it's hard for me to take your despair very seriously, Doctor. You obviously enjoy it so much. \nBOCK Oh, bugger off. That's all I need now, clinical insights. Some cockamamie twenty-five-year-old... \nBARBARA Twenty-seven. \nBOCK ...acidhead's going to reassure me about menopause now. Look, I'd like to be alone, so why don't you beat it? Close the door and turn off the lights on your way out. \nThey are both suddenly conscious of a third presence in the room. They look to the door where Mr. Blacktree, fully clothed again and carrying his coat, is standing in the doorway. Barbara uncrosses her long legs and stands. \nBARBARA (crossing to the door) Mr. Blacktree disapproves of my miniskirt, but it was the only thing I had to come to the city with. Back at the tribe, I wear ankle-length buckskin. \nBOCK Swell. Just close the door and turn off the lights. \nBarbara regards his hunched form and, murmuring in Apache, she exits, closing the door. In the subsequent hush, thunder RUMBLES and CRASHES. Wind sweeps the rain against the window panes. \nThe sounds go unheeded by Bock, still as marble. Slowly, he raises his head and sighs and then fishes about in his jacket pockets to bring out the bottle of potassium and syringe. He takes off his jacket, rolling up his shirtsleeve, poking about for the vein. He removes his trouser belt, which he ties tightly about his upper arm for a tourniquet. Now, he tears the wrapping of the syringe and fits the needle to it. Fiddling about in the pockets of his jacket, he finally finds a crumpled pack of cigarettes. He lights one and returns to the business of killing himself, puffing expressionlessly as he does. Thunder RUMBLES and rain SLASHES. He carefully draws just the right amount of potassium from the bottle to the syringe, peering at the procedure against the light of his desk lamp. He sets the cigarette on the ashtray, switches the hypodermic to his right hand, holds his left arm rigidly out under the light of the lamp... \nBARBARA'S VOICE (off-screen) What're you shooting, Doc? \nHe turns slowly to the doorway, his bare left arm still rigidly extended, the belt dangling, the hypodermic clenched in his other hand. Barbara is perfectly framed in the doorway. He stares at her, slowly suffusing with the numb, blind, total rage of the aborted suicide. The thunder CRASHES. \nBOCK (barely gets the words out) Leave me alone... \nShe approaches the desk affably, turns the potassium around to read the label. \nBARBARA Potassium. You take enough of this stuff, it'll kill you, Doc. (moves toward the couch) It occurred to me that I might have read you wrong, that you really were suicidal. So I came back. \nBock's rage erupts. He crashes the hypodermic syringe down, shattering it. The potassium puddles on the wood. \nBOCK (hysterical rage) Who the hell asked you! \nHe moves around the desk, a shambling bear of a man, a leather belt dangling dementedly from his arm, tears coursing down his cheeks. He advances on her in a stuperous shuffle. \nBOCK Who the hell asked you! \n", "test1_true": "BOCK Leave me alone! Why the hell don't you leave me alone! \nHe is on her, crushing her down into the shadows of the couch, ravenous at her neck and shoulders in a brutish assault, sobbing. \nBOCK Why didn't you let me do it? Who the hell asked you! \nThroughout the scene, CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN through the flesh and fury to an INTENSE TWO-SHOT of this terrified act of love. Then slowly over Bock's plunging shoulder to the woman's face. She gasps at the moment of penetration, then her lovely face slowly shapes into smiling serenity. Bock sobs; even in the shadows we can see the path of the tears on his cheek. \nABRUPT SILENCE. \nOUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL, NIGHT. 4:00 A.M. \nThe quiet, black streets glisten wetly in the puddles of lamplight. \nTHE STEINMETZ PAVILION, TENTH FLOOR \nThe night shift is finishing up. THERESA CAMPANELLA, R.N., a high-strung girl in her early twenties, stands at a water tap holding a glass and popping some pills in her mouth. To the room: \nCAMPANELLA Well, I'll see you. \nTENTH FLOOR CORRIDOR. NIGHT \nCampanella comes out of the Dialysis room, puts on her coat and walks to... \nHOLLY PAVILION LOBBY. NIGHT \nCampanella moves down the empty corridor. All the doors are closed now; only the overhead light in the background of the corridor glows weakly. Campanella puts a cigarette in her mouth, pauses to look for matches; she hasn't any. Scowling with annoyance, she continues to the lobby and stops by a partially visible white-jacketed figure reading a newspaper. \nCAMPANELLA Do you have a match, Doctor? \nShe takes the matches, lights her cigarette, inhaling deeply, when he suddenly sandbags her from behind. She goes down. \nBOCK'S OFFICE. DAYBREAK, WEDNESDAY \nCovered by Bock's overcoat, Barbara tosses and turns on the couch in a small nightmare. Through the windows comes the first gray wash of dawn. FULL SHOT of Barbara, awake and up on one elbow on the verge of a scream. She looks around the room. It is dark, empty, silent. \nACROSS Barbara looking through the door to the secretarial office. It is likewise dark, but suddenly the lights go on and, a moment later, Bock enters. He holds a container of coffee in each hand and has something white draped over his forearm. From under Bock's bulky coat, Barbara watches him lumber to his desk, where he sets the containers of coffee down. He drops the whitish garment over the back of a chair and then sits. He hoists a bulging folder of correspondence from his filing tray and hunches to work, reading. After a moment, he regards the silent figure on the couch across the room. \nBOCK You wouldn't be awake. \nBARBARA What time is it? \nHe rises, picks up the second container and white dress from the chair. She reaches out an arm for the coffee. Bock holds up -- a nurse's uniform. \nBOCK I swiped this for you out of the nurses' locker room. I'll make good on your dress. I'm afraid it's torn beyond repair. Buy yourself a new one or, if you like, give me your size and I'll send it on to you. But I want to talk to you about that. \nBARBARA Talk to me about what? \nBOCK About your father. You really shouldn't move him in his condition. I just had a look at his chart. There's no reason to presume brain damage. You know as well as I you can't predict anything in these instances. He could pull out of that coma at any time. I think you should let him stay here. I'll personally look after him. \nHe has perched on the edge of the couch, and she rests her cheek against the long, bent curve of his back, smiling. \nBARBARA Is this your way of saying you'd like me to stay in town a few more days? \nHe turns to look at her, smiles back. \nBOCK Well, that would be nice, too. \nShe sips her coffee. \nBOCK What do you say, Miss Drummond? \n", "test1_id": 2058, "test2_input": "Mrs. Kimball, Mrs. Christie, Hitchcock and Sloan push through the glass doors to the crossroads of the operating rooms. Through each window, we see operating crews hacking away. \nMRS. CHRISTIE Is she dead? \nMRS. KIMBALL Well, they had to open her up, and that's not good. \nThey gather in anticipation outside O.R. Three and peer over each other's shoulders into the room where the operating crew is hunched over the open-heart massage. The masked circulating nurse looks up, notices the audience at the door, and gives a hopeless shrug. \nHITCHCOCK I better get Mr. Mead. \nHOLLY PAVILION, THE STAFF ROOM \nMilton Mead is sitting in a back seat of the Staff Room -- a lounge with couches, easy chairs and magazine racks -- gives half an ear to the several opinions being simultaneously expressed by: \nLADY FROM WOMEN'S LIB ...abortion? The clinic should be under the supervision and entirely staffed by women and administered by a member of the Women's Committee for Medical Liberation! \nand by \nYOUNG WHITE ACTIVIST ...let's get to the core of the matter which is the criminal and gangster collusion between the American medical establishment and the drug, insurance and tobacco companies who, through their combined racketeering efforts, have produced a dual system of health care. Everything for the rich and nothing for the poor! \nand by \nBLACK PANTHER ...abortion clinic! That's genocide, baby! You're just killing off blacks! We consider proliferation elemental to the class struggle! \nand by \nSUNDSTROM (who has lost his cool altogether and is screaming right along with everyone else) ...for God's sake! We've got eleven people in these buildings, and we've got to get them out of there! We can rectify the injustices of the world tomorrow, but right now, for God's sake, can we get those people out of those buildings? Will you people please listen to me? Will you people please shut up and listen to me? Will you people please call a halt to this participatory democracy and address ourselves to the immediate problem?! \nDuring this maelstrom, the phone at Mead's elbow RINGS. Mead answers it, listens, nods, returns the receiver, stand and slips out of the room into the delicious silence of the... \nHOLLY PAVILION, EXECUTIVE CORRIDOR \n...where Hitchcock emerges from the Administration offices. The two men move down the hall toward each other. \nMILTON MEAD How long ago did this happen? \nHITCHCOCK About half an hour. \nMILTON MEAD Have you called the Medical Examiner? \nHITCHCOCK Not yet. \nMILTON MEAD Well, you'd better do that now. And you better call the precinct station house as well. \nOPERATING ROOM THREE \nDr. Mallory is wrenching off his blood-drenched rubber gloves and flinging them to the floor in a rage. The door to the room opens, and Mrs. Kimball, Mrs. Christie and Mr. Sloan enter. Dr. Mallory is stupefied with anger. Dr. Chu, blessed with Eastern containment, blandly gathers his equipment together, nods to Mrs. Christie. \nDR. CHU Good morning. \nMRS. CHRISTIE Good morning, Doctor. \nDR. CHU This is really something, isn't it? I thought she looked a little different when they brought her in. I even said to one of the nurses, \"She looks a little younger without her dentures.\" I'd only talked to her half an hour before. \nMRS. CHRISTIE Does anybody know who she is? \nDr. Mallory can only stare at her numbly. He turns and stares numbly at Mr. Sloan. \nMRS. CHRISTIE (to Mrs. Kimball, examining the chart dangling from the operating table) What's her chart say? \nCIRCULATING RESIDENT Her chart says Mangafranni. Her bracelet says Mangafranni. The only thing that isn't Mangafranni is the woman. \nDr. Mallory finally explodes. \n", "test2_true": "DR. CHU I had just been talking to her in the Holding Room. She was perfectly fine. A little drowsy. I thought it was funny that when they brought her in, she was out cold. \nDR. MALLORY (shuffling around in aimless circles) Jesus H. Kee-rist! \nMrs. Christie stares down at the face of the dead patient on the table, who has had her chest spread wide open so that the organs are exposed. \nMRS. CHRISTIE Well, we'll just all have to stay here until Mr. Mead or someone from the O.O.D. comes back. \nDR. MALLORY Well, I'm not taking the rap for this! I've already got one malpractice suit pending, and I'm not taking the rap for this one! \nHOLLY PAVILION, ROOM \nWilliam Mead's bed is empty. The Reverend Drummond's suit, still on its hanger, is lying on it. Drummond himself lies comatose and rigged out with I.V.s and catheters. Barbara Drummond is packing her father's things into an open one- suiter valise. The door opens. She looks up. It's Bock. They look at each other -- two people in love. \nBOCK Look, you're not going. I love you, and I'm not going to let you go. \nHe picks up the suit lying on the bed. \nBOCK Come on, let's start putting your father's things back. He's staying here. (hangs the suit in the closet) I'll find an apartment somewhere. I'm staying in a filthy little hotel room. We can't use that. \nHis eyes are caught by a white doctor's uniform hanging in the armoire along with the suits and overcoats of the two patients in the room. He bends over to peer at the nameplate over the breast pocket. \nBARBARA I can't make it here, Herb. I'll crack up. I cracked up once already. One week here, and I'd be running naked through the streets screaming again. I can retain my sanity only in a simple society. \nBOCK For God's sake, Barbara, you can't seriously see me living in a grass shack hunting jackrabbits for dinner? Be sensible for God's sake. \nBARBARA I am being sensible. What is it you're so afraid of leaving here? Your plastic home? Your conditioned air? Your synthetic clothes? Your instant food? I'm offering you green silence and solitude, the natural order of things. Mostly, I'm offering me. I think we're beautiful, Herb. \nBOCK (utterly in love) You make it sound almost plausible. \nBARBARA I don't know why you even hesitate. What's holding you here? Is it your wife? \nBOCK No, that's all over. I suppose if I'm married to anything, it's this hospital. It's been my whole life. I just can't walk out on it as if it never mattered. I'm middle-class. Among us middle-class, love doesn't triumph over all. Responsibility does. \nBARBARA Herb, don't ask me to stay here with you, because I love you, and I will. And we'll both be destroyed. \nHe turns to her again. They both look away. \nBARBARA I've got the bill here to pay yet. \nBOCK I'll come with you. \nShe gathers her raincoat and goes. Bock follows her out into the... \nHOLLY PAVILION, EIGHTH FLOOR, CORRIDOR \n...where Dr. Joseph Lagerman, Head of Nephrology, perhaps remembered from an earlier scene, has been waiting for Bock. He joins them en route to the elevators. \nLAGERMAN Herb, you asked me to find that dialysis nurse. \nBOCK What dialysis nurse? \nBarbara has continued walking. Bock starts to follow her. \nBARBARA I'll go pay the bill. \nLAGERMAN The one who goofed on your patient, Drummond. \nBock turns back to Lagerman. \nLAGERMAN Well, her name is Theresa Campanella, but you are not going to believe this, Herb.

Have you talked to Dr. Hogan about this? \nBOCK And, on top of everything else, the other patient in your father's room overheard his whole confession and just told the Chief Administrator of the hospital. They're sending for the cops. \nREVERSE ACROSS Welbeck on phone at Nurses' Station. In the background, Bock and Barbara stare at him. \nWELBECK (almost apoplectic on phone) Oh, my God, Arthur. Well, who held title? Do the underwriters know about this yet?... Oh my God! Arthur, what're you waiting for? Arrest the son of a bitch! Turn him in!... Oh my God! When?... Of course, Arthur, call me right back. I'm at the Holly Pavilion, Eighth Floor. Please! Right away! \nHe hangs up. \nBOCK Are you all right, Welbeck? \nWELBECK All right?! That son of a bitch is trying to wipe me out! My partner, the eminent orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Noel Hogan, is a miserable thief. And he's trying to wipe me out! \nMRS.

(Hitchcock is on the phone.) \nWELBECK Well, Drummond, you don't seem that much the worse for the wear. \nWilliam Mead stares dully at Welbeck. Then he looks dully at Bock. \nWELBECK (to Hitchcock) Would you mind using some other phone? I'm expecting an important call. \nWILLIAM MEAD What is this? Who... who is this guy? \nHITCHCOCK (on phone) Yes, well, I'll be at the Nurses' Desk, Sergeant. It would be futile for me to try to explain this to you over the phone. \nWELBECK (leafing through Drummond's chart) You've got a bit of fever, Drummond, but you're coming along very well. \nWILLIAM MEAD I'm not Drummond, you monkey! Drummond's the other bed! \nThe phone now BUZZES. Welbeck and Hitchcock both head for it. \nWELBECK That's mine. (on phone) It's Welbeck here... Yes, Arthur, go ahead... \nWilliam Mead is painfully trying to get off his bed. \nWILLIAM MEAD I'm getting out of this nuthouse! \nBOCK (pushing him gently back) All right, take it easy, Mr. Mead. \nHitchcock, satisfied the call is not for him, exits. \nWILLIAM MEAD I came in here just to get a lousy polyp cut out. \n", "test3_true": "WILLIAM MEAD (appealing to the gods) I'm a sick man!

William Mead promptly hides his head under his sheet. \nBock moves quickly to the prostrate Welbeck, feels his throat for the carotid pulse, pulls out his stethoscope, rips Welbeck's shirt open, and listens for heartsounds. He picks up the dangling telephone receiver, gets a dial tone. \nBOCK (on phone) Cardiac arrest, Holly Eight. \nBarbara strips off her coat. She is still in nurse's uniform. She leans into the hall and calls a passing nurse. \nBARBARA We have an emergency here. \nBOCK (rips off Welbeck's natty jacket) Breathe him. \nBarbara helps Bock get Welbeck's dead weight onto the floor. On his knees, Bock straddles Welbeck's prone form, balls his fist and belts Welbeck on his chest. He begins intensive heart massage. Barbara gets down on her knees, opens Welbeck's mouth and commences mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. In the background, the P.A. system blandly echoes: \nP.A. SYSTEM (off-screen) C.A.C. Holly Eight. Please clear all corridors. \nMrs. Donovan and aides move C.A.C. into the room, immediately followed by Intern Chandler rushing past them. \nMRS.

He peers out from under his covers in wide-eyed disbelief and ducks under again. Bock massages Welbeck's heart. Barbara continues mouth-to-mouth. Nurse Felicia Chile hurries in, pushing the emergency cart before her. \nBARBARA (to Nurse Chile as others begin moving William Mead's bed out of the room) Give him an ambu bag and an airway. \nVOICE (off-screen) What's been happening? \nNurse Chile has shunted the emergency cart aside to let the bed out and is extracting an ambu bag and tube from the cart's lower shelf. \nCHANDLER (to Seventh Floor Nursing Supervisor just outside door) Watch it... \nP.A.

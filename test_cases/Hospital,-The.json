{"train": "THE HOSPITAL \nWritten by \nPaddy Chayefsky \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nTHE HOSPITAL. DAY. MAY, \nPANORAMIC VIEW of The Hospital -- a vast medical complex, a sprawling pastiche of architecture extending ten blocks north and south on First Avenue and east to the river. \nThe Hospital was founded in the late 19th century, and there are still a few begrimed Victorian Bedlams and Bastilles among the buildings. Mostly though, it is Medical Modern 1971, white and chrome and lots of glass and concrete shafts and rotundas. A spanking new Community Mental Health Clinic towers among the tenements at the northern end of the complex. On the far side of First Avenue, a twenty-story apartment house with recessed balconies and picture windows to house the resident staff has just recently been completed, and next to it, eight ghetto buildings are being demolished to make way -- according to the construction company's sign -- for a new Drug Rehabilitation Center, to be completed in 1973, we should all live so long. This is where the shattering SOUNDS OF CONSTRUCTION are coming from. A block length of generators and cement and demolition machines are POUNDING, CRASHING, SCREAMING. Traffic HONKS and BRAYS up First Avenue. \nIt is a cold spring morning -- 10:00 A.M. \nA 1966 station wagon pulls up to the Holly Pavilion. \nA tiny, fragile, white-bearded OLD MAN, almost lost in his overcoat, is helped from the rear of a station wagon and slowly led to the entrance doors by a middle-aged nurse. \nNARRATOR On Monday morning, a patient named Guernsey, male, middle-seventies was admitted to the hospital complaining of chest pains. \nHOLLY PAVILION. EIGHTH FLOOR CORRIDOR \nThe old man is now in a wheelchair pushed by a hospital orderly down the corridor. \nNARRATOR He had been referred by a nursing home where the doctor had diagnosed his condition as angina pectoris. Now it is axiomatic that nursing home doctors are always wrong. \nROOM 806 \nThe old man, shirtless, is propped on the edge of the bed, wheezing. DR. SCHAEFER, a young intern in white-uniform, perches beside him with the old man's chart in his lap, taking down his history. The other patient in the two-bedded room, a MIDDLE-AGED MAN, is comatose and all rigged up with I.V.'s and catheters. \nNARRATOR The intern who admitted Mr. Guernsey, however, accepted the diagnosis and prescribed morphine, a drug suitable for angina but not at all suitable for emphysema, which is, unfortunately, what the old man actually had. Within an hour... \nEIGHTH FLOOR CORRIDOR \nTwo orderlies rush the old man's bed with, of course, the old man in it, past the Nurses' Station and into a waiting elevator. \nNARRATOR ...the patient became unresponsive and diaphoretic and was raced up to Intensive Care with an irregular pulse of 150, blood pressure 90 over 60, respiration rapid and shallow. \nINTENSIVE CARE \nAn oxygen mask is applied to the old man's face by the resident. \nNARRATOR The resident on duty now compounded the blunder by treating the old man for pulmonary edema. He gave him digitalis, diuretics and oxygen. This restored the old man's color... \nEIGHTH FLOOR CORRIDOR \nThe elevator door opens. Two orderlies wheel the sleeping man on his bed back around the Nurses' Station and down the corridor to his room. \nNARRATOR ...and he was sent back to his room in the Holly Pavilion, ruddy complected and peacefully asleep. \nROOM 806. EVENING \nThe old man is back in his room sleeping serenely, his tiny body making barely a ripple in the white sheet that covers him. The room is in hushed shadows. A yellowish light diffuses into the room from the half-opened bathroom door. The other patient in the room remains as before, comatose and silent. \nNARRATOR In point of fact, the patient was in CO2 narcosis... \nROOM 806 \nAll the lights are on now. NURSE PENNY CANDUSO and an orderly are wrapping the old man in a post-mortem shroud. BRUBAKER, the senior resident, is giving hell to Schaefer, the intern. \nNARRATOR ...and died at seven-thirty that evening. \nNURSE PEREZ (trying again, with little hope) Doctor Schaefer? \nShe sighs, turns and leaves the room. \nEIGHTH FLOOR CORRIDOR \nNurse Perez, frowning and pursing her lips, moves slowly back to... \nEIGHTH FLOOR, NURSES' STATION \nHead Nurse Reardon is still bent over her paperwork. \nNURSE PEREZ Listen, did you know Doctor Schaefer was in Eight-O-Six, because he's dead? \nMRS. REARDON (late forties, continues her painstaking paperwork, grunts) What? \nNURSE PEREZ I'm just telling you, Dr. Schaefer is dead. \nMRS. REARDON (works on; after a moment, looks up) What do you want, Perez? \nNURSE PEREZ Look, I don't know what the hell this is all about, but Dr. Schaefer is in Room 806 with an I.V. running and he's dead. I didn't even know he was sick. \nMRS. REARDON (regards Perez a moment) Perez, what the hell are you talking about? (appeals to Nurse Rivers coming out of the floor pharmacy) Do you know what the hell she's talking about? \nNURSE PEREZ Well, maybe I'm going crazy. I don't know. Isn't Room 806 the patient Guernsey? I mean, did something happen I don't know about? \nMRS. REARDON Perez, I don't know what you're talking about. \nNURSE PEREZ This is the nuttiest thing I ever saw. Dr. Schaefer's in Room 806 dead. \nMRS. REARDON What Dr. Schaefer? Our Dr. Schaefer? \nNURSE PEREZ Our Dr. Schaefer. The one who's always grabbing everybody's ass. \nMRS. REARDON (to Nurse Rivers) Do you know what she's talking about? I don't know what she's talking about. (to Perez) What do you mean Doctor Schaefer's in Room 806 dead? \nNURSE PEREZ I mean, he's lying on the far bed, stone dead, and with an I.V. tube sticking out of him. And if you don't believe me, maybe you just ought to get up and look for yourself. \nWith a short, irritable sigh, Mrs. Reardon abandons her paperwork and heads down the west corridor, followed by Nurses Perez and Rivers. CAMERA TRACKS as Mrs. Reardon turns to Nurse Rivers. \nMRS. REARDON All right, maybe you'd better call Mrs. Christie. \nPhone RINGS. \nBOCK'S HOTEL ROOM \nDark. Venetian blinds drawn. TV set on, a gray coarse-grained square. PHONE RINGS. \nDR. HERBERT BOCK, 53 years old, a large man, bulky, disheveled, apparently fell asleep in a chair while watching television the night before. The bed still has its spread on but is rumpled. Bock is in trousers and shirt, collar opened, barefooted. PHONE RINGS. The reading lamp is the only light in the room except for the sheen of gray hissing from the television. Newspapers litter the floor. Books, two-day-old plates of food, yesterday's mugs of coffee, cigar-stuffed ashtrays, a shirt, a pair of pants, a winter overcoat, a battered gray fedora have been slung about. PHONE on the bedtable RINGS again, begins to penetrate the sotted sleep of the man. Two bottles of booze, one empty, and a clump of glasses are on the coffee table in front of Bock. He grunts, opens an eye. PHONE RINGS. Bock suddenly exsufflates in a snorting grunt. He stands, shuffles to the bed, a big, sodden fellow, picks up the receiver, interrupting its next RING. He sinks, sitting on the bed. \nBOCK This is Dr. Bock... Yes, Mrs. Christie, what is it? It's all right, I'd be getting up in a few minutes anyway... I'm sorry I missed that. Would you say it again? Yes, I know him, Schaefer, the stud with the glasses, who fancies the nurses... I'm afraid I don't understand that, what do you mean? Was he sick? I mean, was he... uh, what was the cause of death? Was he being treated? I don't understand. What was he doing in the bed? You did say he... Look, Mrs. Christie, did you call the office? Good, well, I'll... No, no, it's all right. I'll be getting my wake-up call any minute anyway. \nHe returns the receiver to its cradle, sits disoriented, unbuttoning his shirt. \nHOSPITAL. MORNING. 8:00 A.M. \nLONG SHOT of the hospital, now alive and jumping. Taxis pull up and out of the large U-shaped drive. A noisy picket line of about twenty chanting protesters parade with signs in an uneven ellipse. \nGRUMBLING PROTESTERS (chanting) Two-four! Help the poor! \nMost of the placards are slogan-y: \"PEOPLE YES! DOCTORS NO!\" -- \"CURE POVERTY! HEAL THE POOR!\" Two protesters move toward the street, waving and yelling at an approaching car. One, a young white fellow wears a sandwich board that goes into the matter at some length: \"WE PROTEST THE EVICTION OF 386 BLACK FAMILIES AND THE DESTRUCTION OF THEIR HOMES TO SERVE THE EXPANSIONIST POLICIES OF THIS IMPERIALIST HOSPITAL.\" \nIn the back seat of the car sits JOHN SUNDSTROM, handsomely graying, tanned, early fifties, the Director of the Hospital. He looks up. That young demonstrator, DR. IVES, a sandy-haired bespectacled man of 30 in a white doctor's coat, sidles to the car's open rear window angrily shouting. \nMRS. CUSHING Would you wait a moment, please. I'm on the phone, can't you see I'm on the phone? (rummaging through a stack of charts, large paper forms in quadruplicate) ...Of course not, do they ever? (hangs up, takes two charts from the desk, pushes through the waiting line) Would you mind, please. I have to get through, do you mind? \nShe makes her way to the door and goes out into... \nEMERGENCY AREA, ENTRANCE LOBBY \n...which is congested. Mrs. Cushing enters... \nEMERGENCY, ADMITTING AND TREATMENT ROOMS \nNURSE (on phone) Give me that one again... thirty- two? \nFacing the desk are six curtained treatment rooms, mostly open to view. Behind the desk are a supply room and another treatment room. Both are occupied, the former by a PARANOID LADY wringing her hands in a paranoid rush and listened to by a very patient young intern. \nPARANOID LADY They follow me everywhere. Three big black men. Naked, completely exposed. Right in the street. Hanging down to their knees. Disgusting. They're waiting out there for me now... \n...and in the other room, a man in his thirties is being treated for some sort of head lacerations. In one treatment room, the Chief of Emergency Service, DR. SPEZIO, a man in his late thirties, along with an intern, an anesthesiologist and a nurse, is bent over a naked and comatose young black woman of eighteen, covered somewhat with a sheet. She's a junkie, being intubated, i.e. a small endotracheal tube has been inserted into her mouth. This is the most melodramatic of the varied activity here. \nA middle-aged man complaining of chest pains is lying clothed in another treatment room; a nurse attends him. \nAn asthmatic middle-aged woman sits in still another room being administered her 500 mg. of amenophylene subcutaneously. \nThe curtains on another room are drawn for privacy. On chairs in the corner sit a teenage boy with a badly sprained ankle and an elderly man bathing his hand in an enamel basin held in his lap. \nA young mother with a five-year-old daughter with a badly cut arm is being attended to by the back wall. The Emergency Room Nursing Supervisor, MISS ARONOVICI, a pretty woman in her mid-twenties, is sterilizing the little girl's wound. \nMrs. Cushing makes her way to Miss Aronovici. They detest each other. \nMRS. CUSHING Did you call upstairs and tell them to admit a patient named Mitgang? \nMRS. ARONOVICI (continuing to treat the little girl) The concussion? \nMRS. CUSHING I don't know. They just called me. They said you didn't fill out the chart. And where do you come off sending anyone up to Admitting without my okay? \nMiss Aronovici turns to Mrs. Cushing, regarding her sweetly. \nMRS. ARONOVICI Sally, would you get the fuck out of here. The patient's in the Holding Room. You want his Blue Cross number, you go in and you get his Blue Cross number. \nMrs. Cushing elbows back through the line of patients waiting at the Admitting desk. \nMRS. CUSHING Do you mind, please... \nThere are now three nurses behind the desk, all of them on phones. One nurse calls to Dr. Spezio. \nNURSE O.P.D. wants to know how that asthmatic they sent down is. \nDR. SPEZIO (just leaving the group around the junkie) She's fine. We'd like to keep her here a little while. \nSpezio heads for the door where he is intercepted by Mrs. Cushing. \nMRS. CUSHING May I see you a moment, Doctor, if you don't mind. \nDR. SPEZIO (sighs, calls back to the triage nurse) I'll be right back. \nHe goes out, followed by Mrs. Cushing, into... \nEMERGENCY AREA, LOBBY \nSpezio and Mrs. Cushing move between laundry and supply carts. \nMRS. CUSHING (thrusting some papers at the doctor) If you don't mind, Doctor, is this your handwriting? \nSpezio stops, sighs, examines the paper. \nDR. SPEZIO How the hell long has this man been lying here? Isn't this that doctor who came in around nine o'clock? \nMILTON MEAD'S OFFICE. 2:00 P.M. \nMILTON MEAD, late thirties, lean, efficient but under constant strain, is having his daily staff luncheon conference, which consists of a CHIEF ENGINEER, the ASSISTANT ADMINISTRATOR OF PERSONNEL, three residents in administration, including Hitchcock, sandwiches and coffee. \nCHIEF ENGINEER I mean, they gave me a hard time, Con Ed. \"For Pete's Sake,\" I said, \"this is a hospital. One of our feedlines just blew...\" \nMead's phone RINGS and he picks it up. \nMILTON MEAD Yeah? (it's another annoyance; he sighs with irritation) \nCHIEF ENGINEER I mean, it's lucky we traced it in time. \nMILTON MEAD (on phone) No, I'll be right up. (hangs up, stands) Have we covered about everything? \nADMINISTRATIVE RESIDENT Dr. Kish has been driving me nuts with the O.R. schedule. \nMILTON MEAD He's supposed to see me about that. \nHe moves across his office into... \nMEAD'S SECRETARY'S OFFICE \nActually a communal office with desks for three secretaries. \nMEAD'S SECRETARY (looks up to Mead from talking on the phone) This is the Emergency Room. One of the doctors just died of a heart attack. \nMILTON MEAD (pauses) One of our staff? \nMEAD'S SECRETARY I think so. \nMead frowns, leans back into his own office. \nMILTON MEAD (to Hitchcock) Tom, you want to go down to the Emergency Room? One of our doctors just died. \nHITCHCOCK What? Another one? \nMILTON MEAD Yeah, see what that's about. (en passant to secretary) I'll be on Holly Eight. I'll be right back. \nHOLLY PAVILION, EIGHTH FLOOR \nThe staff elevator door opens, and Milton Mead comes out. He has apparently been buttonholed in the elevator by a woman in a doctor's coat, DR. IMMELMAN, Pathology, who follows him out... \nDR. IMMELMEN It's no longer pilferage, Milton. It's reached the point of piracy. That's the third microscope this month. \nMILTON MEAD Why don't we get together on this sometime this afternoon, Fran? \nDR. IMMELMAN One o'clock? \nMILTON MEAD One o'clock will be fine. \nHe turns left and heads for... \nHOLLY PAVILION, EIGHTH FLOOR, NURSES' STATION \n...where Head Nurse Donovan is bent over her paperwork. In the background, we see normal morning hospital activity. Nurse's Aid, SHARLENE STONE, takes towels into a room. R.N. Felicia Chile comes out of another, bearing her enamel tray of instruments. \nAlso in the background, the curious quartet from before -- the beautiful woman, the elderly Indian, the minister, Dr. Sutcliffe. Mead hardly notices them as he makes for the desk. \nMRS. DONOVAN (without pausing or looking up) Your brother's in the room, Mr. Mead. \nMILTON MEAD What room is it? \nMiss Lebow and Miss McGuire clatter away at typewriters. Sitting on a chair in the crowded office is a senior staff doctor, a man in his late forties, wearing a coat similar to Bock's. He is DR. LAGERMAN. He looks up from the magazine he's been leafing through as Bock storms in. \nDR. LAGERMAN Hi, Herb... \nBock acknowledges him with a brusque nod, storms over to Miss Lebow. \nBOCK Get me Dr. Gilley. Put him on page if you have to. I want to talk to him right now. I don't care if he's operating. (wheels around to Miss McGuire) And you get me some monkey named Ives. Ives. I-V-E-S, first name Elroy. He's in the Farkis Pavilion. \nDR. LAGERMAN Herb... \nBOCK I want to talk to you, Joe. Would you mind coming into my office? \nHe strides, followed by Dr. Lagerman, into... \nBOCK'S PRIVATE OFFICE \n...and slams the door shut behind him. \nBOCK Have you got some punk named Ives rotating in your department? \nDR. LAGERMAN Listen, Herb... \nBOCK (sits at his desk) I also want to know what the hell kind of a dialysis room you're running. I just came from... \nThe phone RINGS. Bock seizes it. \nBOCK Yeah... Gilley? Put him on. Bock. Didn't you tell me a couple of months ago you were going to cut off all privileges for that assassin, Welbeck? Yeah. Wellbeck. He just butchered another one of my patients... Oh, come on, Harry! The man's a buccaneer! I want him brought before the Medical Executive Committee... He's in your department, Harry, not mine. He's putatively a surgeon!... I'll be here! (slams receiver down, stares at Lagerman) Listen, Joe, I think you should know that you've got a research guy in your department named Ives who's been doing some very dubious biopsies. We're having enough trouble squeezing grants out of the Nixon administration... \nDR. LAGERMAN Ives is dead, Herb. That's why I'm here. \nThis gives Bock pause. He blinks at Lagerman. \nBOCK What do you mean, Ives is dead? \nDR. LAGERMAN I mean he's dead. He had a heart attack in the Emergency Room. \nBOCK He had a heart attack in the Emergency Room? \nDR. LAGERMAN Yeah. \nBOCK (blinking) What the hell is this? Some kind of plague? (stands) Where is he now? \nDR. LAGERMAN They were just taking him down to Pathology. \nHOLLY PAVILION, FIRST FLOOR, PATHOLOGY DEPT \nBock, Lagerman and Hitchcock have gathered across the shrouded figure of Dr. Ives on a stretcher. We are in the lab section of Pathology; in the background, through the glass part of the door separating the lab from the surgery room, we can see the autopsy on Dr. Schaefer being performed. \nSchaefer's naked white cadaver is stretched out on an operating table. He has been opened up and all his vital organs are being excised. It's bloody. The autopsy is being performed by DR. BREWSTER, the Resident in Pathology, dressed in surgical scrub. \nHITCHCOCK ...and the next thing anybody knew, about three hours later, Mrs. Cushing from Accounting came in and said there was a dead man in the Holding Room. \nBOCK You don't find anything grotesque about all this? \nHITCHCOCK What do you mean? \nBOCK I mean, at half past eight this morning, we meet over a doctor who's been killed intravenously, and here we are again, four hours later, with another doctor who had a heart attack in the Emergency Room. \nHITCHCOCK Well, what're you suggesting Doctor? Do you think we have a mad killer stalking the halls of the hospital? Presumably, Dr. Ives died of a heart attack and Schaefer in a diabetic coma. People do die of these things. It's all perhaps coincidental, but I don't think I'd call it grotesque. \nBOCK How long are they going to be on Schaefer's post? \nHe knocks on the glass window of the door separating the laboratory from the operating room. Dr. Brewster turns from his gory chore. Bock makes a gesture saying, \"How much longer?\" Brewster raises ten blood-drenched rubber-gloved fingers. Bock turns and shuffles across the lab for the door out. \nPHARMACY \n...where he quickly runs his finger along the second shelf until he comes to the bottle of potassium which he filches off the shelf and slips into his pocket. He rummages through the drawers for a hypodermic syringe. Through the open doorway, we see Nurse Devine making her way swiftly up to Mrs. Dunne at the desk. \nNURSE DEVINE Well, honey, we got a witch-doctor in Eight-O-Six, and you better go in there. You know that Indian that was sitting in Eight-O-Six all night? He's still there, and the girl's there, and they're doing some voodoo in there, and I ain't kidding. \nBehind Mrs. Dunne, Bock appears in the doorway to the pharmacy where he stands listening. \nMRS. DUNNE (looking up) What are you talking about? \nNURSE DEVINE I mean that Indian's in there, half- naked and going pis-pis-pis with a little bag. You just better get in there, Mrs. Dunne. \nMrs. Dunne, annoyed, gets up and heads for the west corridor, followed by Nurse Devine and by an intrigued Dr. Bock at a few paces behind. \nNURSE DEVINE (to NURSE WEITZENBAUM, coming out of another room) You want to see somethin', baby? You jus' come here. \nAs the small procession bears down, Barbara Drummond slips out of that room to intercept them. \nBARBARA (keeping her voice low) Look, it's a perfectly harmless ceremony, nothing to get excited about. It'll be over in a few minutes anyway. Mr. Blacktree is a shaman who gets his power from the thunder, and it's imperative he conclude his rituals while the storm is still going on. \nNURSE DUNNE Visiting hours were over at nine o'clock, Miss. \nBock reaches for the door to the room. \nBARBARA All that's going on in there, Doctor, is a simple Apache prayer for my father's recovery. \nBock makes a vague noise, neither contradicting her nor assenting, and continues around her into... \nROOM 806 \nAs Bock slides in, a bit of the corridor light comes in with him. The curtains have been left sufficiently open to reveal Mr. Blacktree. He is still stripped to the waist and marked with crosses of pollen. He extends two twigs to the four directions after which he places the twigs carefully on the white sheet covering Drummond in a pattern around the amulet already there. Behind Bock, Mrs. Dunne can be seen peeking in. The Indian is oblivious to both of them. Bock watches it all with interest for a moment and then backs out into... \nEIGHTH FLOOR CORRIDOR \n...closing the door after him. \nBARBARA The markings he's made on my father's arms are from the pollen of the tule plant. The twigs have no significance other than they've been struck by lightning and are consequently appeals to the spirit of lightning. It's all entirely harmless, a religious ceremony, not a medical one. \nBOCK You don't seriously believe all that mumbo-jumbo will cure him? \nBARBARA On the other hand, it won't kill him, Doctor. \nThey regard each other levelly. \nBOCK (grunts) Okay. Go ahead. \nHe wheels and clumps off for the stairway exit. \nBARBARA Thank you. \nNurse Weitzenbaum opens the door of the room and peeks in. At the stairway exit, Bock pauses to look back at all the women in front of Room 806. \nBOCK Miss Drummond, are you still taking your father out? \nBARBARA Yes. I still have to arrange an ambulance service. Is there a phone around I could use? \nBOCK Use my office. \nBARBARA Thank you. \nBock exits. Barbara edges past Weitzenbaum, who is still peeking into the room. \nROOM 806 \nBock looks up, and they suddenly find their eyes locked. The dark, dense air in the room fairly steams with incipient sexuality. \nBOCK (looks down again) You're wasting your time. I've been impotent for years. \nBARBARA Rubbish. \nWith a crash of his fist on the desktop, Bock stands; he is in a drunken rage. \nBOCK (lurches about) What the hell's wrong with being impotent? My God, you kids are more hung up on sex than the Victorians! I've got a son, twenty-three. I threw him out of the house last year. Pietistic little humbug. He preached universal love and despised everyone. He had a blanket contempt for the middle class, even its decencies. He detested my mother because she had petit bourgeois pride in her son the doctor. I cannot tell you how brutishly he ignored that rather good old lady. When she died, he didn't even come to the funeral. He thought the chapel service an hypocrisy. His generation didn't live with lies, he told me. \"Everybody lives with lies,\" I said. I grabbed him by his poncho, dragged him the full length of our seven-room despicably affluent middle-class apartment and flung him out. I haven't seen him since. But do you know what he said to me as he stood there on that landing on the verge of tears. He shrieked at me: \"You old fink! You can't even get it up anymore!\" That was it, you see. That was his real revolution. It wasn't racism and the oppressed poor and the war in Vietnam. The ultimate American societal sickness was a limp dingus. Hah! (he lurches about, laughing rustily) My God, if there is a despised and misunderstood minority in this country, it's us poor impotent bastards. Well, I'm impotent and proud of it! Impotence is beautiful, baby! (he raises a militant fist) Power to the Impotent! Right on, baby! \nBARBARA (smiling) Right on. \nBOCK (stares drunkenly at her) When I say impotent, I don't mean merely limp. Disagreeable as it may be for a woman, a man may sometimes lust for other things, something less transient than an erection, some sense of permanent worth. That's what medicine was for me, my reason for being. When I was thirty-four, Miss Drummond, I presented a paper before the annual convention of the Society of Clinical Investigation that pioneered the whole goddam field of immunology. A breakthrough! I'm in all the textbooks. I happen to be an eminent man, Miss Drummond. And you want to know something, Miss Drummond? I don't give a goddam. When I say I'm impotent, I mean I've lost even my desire for work, which is a hell of a lot more primal a passion than sex. I've lost my raison d'etre, my purpose, the only thing I ever truly loved. It's all rubbish anyway. Transplants, antibodies, we manufacture genes, we can produce birth ectogenetically, we can practically clone people like carrots, and half the kids in this ghetto haven't even been inoculated for polio! We have assembled the most enormous medical establishment ever conceived, and people are sicker than ever! We cure nothing! We heal nothing! The whole goddam wretched world is strangulating in front of our eyes! That's what I mean when I say impotent! You don't know what the hell I'm talking about, do you? \nBARBARA Of course, I do. \nBOCK I'm tired, I'm terribly tired, Miss Drummond. And I hurt, and I've got nothing going for me anymore. Can you understand that? \nBARBARA Yes, of course. \nBOCK Then can you understand that the only admissable matter left is death? \nHe suspects he is going to cry and turns quickly away. He sits heavily and fights his tears. \nBARBARA Sounds to me like a familiar case of morbid menopause. \nBOCK Oh Christ. \nBARBARA Well, it's hard for me to take your despair very seriously, Doctor. You obviously enjoy it so much. \nBOCK Oh, bugger off. That's all I need now, clinical insights. Some cockamamie twenty-five-year-old... \nBARBARA Twenty-seven. \nBOCK ...acidhead's going to reassure me about menopause now. Look, I'd like to be alone, so why don't you beat it? Close the door and turn off the lights on your way out. \nThey are both suddenly conscious of a third presence in the room. They look to the door where Mr. Blacktree, fully clothed again and carrying his coat, is standing in the doorway. Barbara uncrosses her long legs and stands. \nBARBARA (crossing to the door) Mr. Blacktree disapproves of my miniskirt, but it was the only thing I had to come to the city with. Back at the tribe, I wear ankle-length buckskin. \nBOCK Swell. Just close the door and turn off the lights. \nBarbara regards his hunched form and, murmuring in Apache, she exits, closing the door. In the subsequent hush, thunder RUMBLES and CRASHES. Wind sweeps the rain against the window panes. \nThe sounds go unheeded by Bock, still as marble. Slowly, he raises his head and sighs and then fishes about in his jacket pockets to bring out the bottle of potassium and syringe. He takes off his jacket, rolling up his shirtsleeve, poking about for the vein. He removes his trouser belt, which he ties tightly about his upper arm for a tourniquet. Now, he tears the wrapping of the syringe and fits the needle to it. Fiddling about in the pockets of his jacket, he finally finds a crumpled pack of cigarettes. He lights one and returns to the business of killing himself, puffing expressionlessly as he does. Thunder RUMBLES and rain SLASHES. He carefully draws just the right amount of potassium from the bottle to the syringe, peering at the procedure against the light of his desk lamp. He sets the cigarette on the ashtray, switches the hypodermic to his right hand, holds his left arm rigidly out under the light of the lamp... \nBARBARA'S VOICE (off-screen) What're you shooting, Doc? \nHe turns slowly to the doorway, his bare left arm still rigidly extended, the belt dangling, the hypodermic clenched in his other hand. Barbara is perfectly framed in the doorway. He stares at her, slowly suffusing with the numb, blind, total rage of the aborted suicide. The thunder CRASHES. \nBOCK (barely gets the words out) Leave me alone... \nShe approaches the desk affably, turns the potassium around to read the label. \nBARBARA Potassium. You take enough of this stuff, it'll kill you, Doc. (moves toward the couch) It occurred to me that I might have read you wrong, that you really were suicidal. So I came back. \nBock's rage erupts. He crashes the hypodermic syringe down, shattering it. The potassium puddles on the wood. \nBOCK (hysterical rage) Who the hell asked you! \nHe moves around the desk, a shambling bear of a man, a leather belt dangling dementedly from his arm, tears coursing down his cheeks. He advances on her in a stuperous shuffle. \nBOCK Who the hell asked you! \nBARBARA I expect you can call me Barbara, considering you ravished me three times last night. \nBOCK Three times? \nBARBARA Oh, look at him, pretending he didn't count. You were as puffed up as a toad about it. Punched a couple of holes in your crusade for universal impotence, didn't it? I think we're on a first name basis by now. I'll call you Herb. \nBOCK Let's give your father a week, Barbara, what do you say? \nBARBARA (a frown darkens her face) No, I don't want my father in this hospital. I had a dream about this hospital. (some of the terror shows on her face) I dreamt this enormous starched white tile building suddenly erupted like a volcano, and all the patients, doctors, nurses, attendants, orderlies, the whole line staff, the food service people, the aged, the lame -- and you right in the middle -- were stampeding in one hideous screaming suicidal mass into the sea. (she stares at him wide-eyed, reliving the dream) I'm taking my father out of here -- and as quickly as I can. \nThey stare at each other, she in terror, he with affection. \nBOCK You're a real fruitcake, you know? \nShe sets her coffee down on the couch and decides to wear Bock's overcoat rather than use it as a cover. She searches for the sleeves. Bock assists her. \nBARBARA Well, let me put it this way. I love you. I fancied you from the first moment you came lumbering down that hallway upstairs. I said to Mr. Blacktree, \"Who's that hulking bear of a man?\" The Apaches are reverential about bears. They won't eat bear meat; they never skin bears. Bear is thought of as both benign and evil, but very strong power. Men with bear power are highly respected and are frequently said to be great healers. \nBy now she's standing, the overcoat reaching her toes. She looks down at Bock perched on the couch. \nBARBARA I said to Mr. Blacktree, \"That man gets his power from the bear.\" \nBOCK Swell. Now, look, do you have a hotel, some sort of accommodations where you can stay for a week or so? \nBarbara reaches for her coffee, sips, moves around in her tent of a coat. \nBARBARA All right, let me put it this way, Herb. My father and I accept the implacability of death. If he dies, he dies, but I'm taking him out of here and back to Mexico about one o'clock this afternoon. I want you to come with us, because I love you and want children. \nBOCK I'm afraid Mexico sounds a little too remote for me. \nBARBARA We could use you down there, you know. There's a curiously high incidence of T.B. And you'd be a doctor again, Herb. You'd be necessary again. If you love me, I don't see what other choice you have. \nBOCK What do you mean, if I love you? I raped you in a suicidal rage. How did we get to love and children all of a sudden? \nBARBARA Oh, for heaven's sake, Herb, I ought to know if a man loves me or not. You must have told me half a hundred times last night you loved me. You murmured it, shouted it; one time, you opened the window and bellowed it out into the street. \nBOCK I think those were more expressions of gratitude than love. \nBARBARA Gratitude for what? \nBOCK Well, my God, for resurrecting feelings of life in me I thought dead. \nBARBARA Well, my God, what do you think love is? \nBOCK Okay, I love you, and you love me. I'm not about to argue with so relentless a romantic. Well, then, since we have this great passion going for us, I don't see why you won't stay on here in New York for a week or ten days... \nBARBARA It's up to ten days now. \nBOCK As long as it takes for your father's condition to improve. \nBARBARA No. I've had these prophetic dreams for seven nights. Seven is a sinister number. The meaning of these dreams is very clear, seven times as clear. I am to get my father and you out of this hospital before we are all destroyed. \nBOCK (throws up his hands) You're certifiable! My God, half the time you're a perfectly intelligent young woman, and then suddenly you turn into a goddam cabalist who believes in dreams, witchcraft and bear power! And I don't like the way you dismiss my whole life as unnecessary. I do a lot of healing right here in Manhattan. I don't have to go to Mexico for it. I also teach. I send out eighty doctors a year into the world, sometimes inspirited, at least competent. I've built up one of the best damned departments of medicine in the world. We've got a hell of a heart unit here and a hell of a kidney group. A lot of people come into this hospital in big trouble, Miss Drummond, and go out better for the experience. So don't tell me how unnecessary I am. \nBARBARA (who's been slipping into the nurse's uniform) Yeah? \nBOCK Yeah. \nBARBARA So how come, eight hours ago, you were trying to kill yourself with an overdose of potassium? \nBOCK Where are you going now? \nThis last in reference to Barbara crossing to the secretaries' office, zippering her uniform. \nSUNDSTROM Welbeck, I'm terribly sorry, but I do have this meeting. (crosses to the door) In any event, there's nothing I can do about it. If Gilley wants to cut your privileges, he's Chief of Surgery, it's within his province. You'll have to have the hearing... \nHe exits, followed by Welbeck into the... \nDIRECTOR'S SUITE, SECRETARIES' OFFICES \nBuzzing now. Typewriters clicking. Phones ringing. \nWELBECK I have a laparotomy laid on for this morning. I assume I'll be allowed to go through with that. \nSUNDSTROM Of course. \nWELBECK (huffing a little) I've been associated with this hospital for six years... \nSUNDSTROM Now, now, Welbeck. It seems to me I've had your name down here before for something... (to his secretary en passant) I'll be in the staff room. \nHe and Welbeck pass out into the... \nEXECUTIVE CORRIDOR \nFlowing with a normal stream of traffic, Sundstrom and Welbeck turn right and head down to the last room of the corridor. Something comes to him, and Sundstrom pauses. \nSUNDSTROM Wait a minute. You're the fellow with the Medicaid collecting business who incorporated and went public, right? I mean, something like that? Milton Mead was telling me about you just the other day. You're a whole medical conglomerate. You've got a Factoring service, a computerized billing company, and a few proprietary hospitals, a few nursing homes. Good heavens, Welbeck, you shouldn't be brought up before a committee of mere doctors. You should be investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. You'll have to go through with the hearing, Welbeck. I don't interfere in these things. \nHe opens the door of the staff room and strides in. Even before he enters, we get a blast of angry voices, both male and female. For the moment the door is ajar, we see a harried Milton Mead being assailed by angry blacks and Puerto Ricans and young white activist doctors. \nHOSPITAL LIBRARY \nVOICES (all overlapping) ...no goddam halfway house, no way, baby! We ain't gonna wait 'til 1973 to deal with this problem! We want to kill the drug thing right now!... imperializing the Blackaporican community, and we reject the bourgie- ass middle-class black traitors and flunkies who are selling out the Blackaporican proletariat masses to the expansionist, racist policies of this shit hospital!... \nWOMAN Let's get back to the abortion issue! \nVOICE Sit down, Woman! \nWOMAN What the hell does the male establishment know about abortions? \nThere's an agitated reaction in the crowd. \nBLACK WOMAN Who the hell raised the issue of birth control? The issue at hand is the control of drug addiction in this community and in the ghetto generally. \nA black man jumps up and points off right. \nBLACK MAN We don't want no goddam abortion... \nA white doctor jumps in from the left. \nWHITE DOCTOR Let's... let's get down to the core of this matter. \nMore murmuring. A Che Guevara -- styled revolutionary moves toward Mead and Sundstrom at the table. \nMAN The point is that this hospital is the landlord for those buildings and they should've turned them down. \nAngrily, he leans over the table facing Sundstrom. \nMAN Those buildings are imperialistic extensions of the medical establishment. This hospital ought to be rebuilding those tenements, give those people decent housing. \nSundstrom raises his hands for quiet and starts to rise. The hostile din has gotten to him. \nSUNDSTROM Please, please, please! \nHOLLY PAVILION, ROOM \nWilliam Mead is transferred from his bed to a rolling stretcher by an orderly in shirt and trousers and by Nurse Felicia Chile. Nurse Chile tucks Mead in. He opens his eyes to look at her drowsily. \nJust like on TV -- well, almost. The surgeon, DR. MALLORY, a bad-tempered man in his fifties, sits on a stool with his gloved hands wrapped in a towel, waiting for the two surgical RESIDENTS to finish painting the operable area, which happens to be the abdomen. It's a hysterectomy. The patient is sheeted except for the small square of abdominal area. \nDR. MALLORY Mangafranni, right? \nSCRUB NURSE Right. \nDR. MALLORY (grumbles to one of the residents) What do you say, huh? We're not going to hang it in the Louvre, you know. \nThe anesthesiologist, DR. CHU, injects pentathol in the I.V. tube. \nDR. CHU Bring a mask over. \nThe RESIDENT ANESTHESIOLOGIST trundles over the oxygen tank, takes the hypodermic syringe from Dr. Chu, who now applies the oxygen mask to the enmarbled profile of the patient. He studies the gauges and equipment around him at the head of the operating table. \nRESIDENT ANESTHESIOLOGIST There's no pulse, Doctor. \nDR. CHU What's the pressure? \nRESIDENT ANESTHESIOLOGIST There's no blood pressure, Doctor. \nDR. CHU No pulse. Get the tube and E.K.G. \nDR. MALLORY What's the matter? \nRESIDENT I can't feel a thing, sir. \nThe room galvanizes into the swift, silent activity of a chest massage. Dr. Mallory, standing and stretching in the back of the room, turns and moves toward the off-screen patient. He begins a vigorous rhythmic massage of the patient's rib cage over the heart. \nDR. MALLORY What the hell happened? \nDr. Mallory thumps the patient's chest hard with his fist, and the others, likewise, go to work. \nDR. CHU I don't know. She must have thrown an embolus. She was doing fine up to now. (to Resident Anesthesiologist) Did you check the gasses? \nRESIDENT ANESTHESIOLOGIST I did, sir. \nDR. CHU The only time I ever saw anybody conk out like this, some jerk switched the nitrous oxide and the gas lines. \nThe scrub nurse is applying electrode paste to the defibrillators. Dr. Mallory yanks the sheets and hospital shirt off the patient and begins very rigorous massage of the exposed ribs; we can hear one rib crack. \nDR. MALLORY Get the damn leads on. For Chrissakes, what the hell is this?! \nRESIDENT She's just a young woman, sir. Do you think we should open the chest? \nDR. MALLORY (defibrillating) She's fifty-three, you buttonhead! \nRESIDENT (off-screen) Bicarb? \nDr. Chu, who has been inserting some suprel and bicarbonate into the tube of the patient's I.V., is frowning at her rigid, white-capped face. He leans over to check the E.K.G. readings. \nDR. CHU She's fibrillating, Doctor. \nMallory straddles the patient. He's doing heavy heart massage. \nDR. MALLORY Jesus H. Christ! \nDR. CHU Okay, stop for a minute... Doctor... \nDr. Chu pushes back, the operating cap on the patient's head, revealing jet-black hair. Mallory starts to massage again. \nDR. MALLORY (barking at the scrub nurse) You got those paddles ready? \nDr. Chu stares blankly at the patient's face, then looks up at the sweating surgeon, perched on the operating table, rhythmically crushing away at the patient's rib cage. \nMrs. Kimball, Mrs. Christie, Hitchcock and Sloan push through the glass doors to the crossroads of the operating rooms. Through each window, we see operating crews hacking away. \nMRS. CHRISTIE Is she dead? \nMRS. KIMBALL Well, they had to open her up, and that's not good. \nThey gather in anticipation outside O.R. Three and peer over each other's shoulders into the room where the operating crew is hunched over the open-heart massage. The masked circulating nurse looks up, notices the audience at the door, and gives a hopeless shrug. \nHITCHCOCK I better get Mr. Mead. \nHOLLY PAVILION, THE STAFF ROOM \nMilton Mead is sitting in a back seat of the Staff Room -- a lounge with couches, easy chairs and magazine racks -- gives half an ear to the several opinions being simultaneously expressed by: \nLADY FROM WOMEN'S LIB ...abortion? The clinic should be under the supervision and entirely staffed by women and administered by a member of the Women's Committee for Medical Liberation! \nand by \nYOUNG WHITE ACTIVIST ...let's get to the core of the matter which is the criminal and gangster collusion between the American medical establishment and the drug, insurance and tobacco companies who, through their combined racketeering efforts, have produced a dual system of health care. Everything for the rich and nothing for the poor! \nand by \nBLACK PANTHER ...abortion clinic! That's genocide, baby! You're just killing off blacks! We consider proliferation elemental to the class struggle! \nand by \nSUNDSTROM (who has lost his cool altogether and is screaming right along with everyone else) ...for God's sake! We've got eleven people in these buildings, and we've got to get them out of there! We can rectify the injustices of the world tomorrow, but right now, for God's sake, can we get those people out of those buildings? Will you people please listen to me? Will you people please shut up and listen to me? Will you people please call a halt to this participatory democracy and address ourselves to the immediate problem?! \nDuring this maelstrom, the phone at Mead's elbow RINGS. Mead answers it, listens, nods, returns the receiver, stand and slips out of the room into the delicious silence of the... \nHOLLY PAVILION, EXECUTIVE CORRIDOR \n...where Hitchcock emerges from the Administration offices. The two men move down the hall toward each other. \nMILTON MEAD How long ago did this happen? \nHITCHCOCK About half an hour. \nMILTON MEAD Have you called the Medical Examiner? \nHITCHCOCK Not yet. \nMILTON MEAD Well, you'd better do that now. And you better call the precinct station house as well. \nOPERATING ROOM THREE \nDr. Mallory is wrenching off his blood-drenched rubber gloves and flinging them to the floor in a rage. The door to the room opens, and Mrs. Kimball, Mrs. Christie and Mr. Sloan enter. Dr. Mallory is stupefied with anger. Dr. Chu, blessed with Eastern containment, blandly gathers his equipment together, nods to Mrs. Christie. \nDR. CHU Good morning. \nMRS. CHRISTIE Good morning, Doctor. \nDR. CHU This is really something, isn't it? I thought she looked a little different when they brought her in. I even said to one of the nurses, \"She looks a little younger without her dentures.\" I'd only talked to her half an hour before. \nMRS. CHRISTIE Does anybody know who she is? \nDr. Mallory can only stare at her numbly. He turns and stares numbly at Mr. Sloan. \nMRS. CHRISTIE (to Mrs. Kimball, examining the chart dangling from the operating table) What's her chart say? \nCIRCULATING RESIDENT Her chart says Mangafranni. Her bracelet says Mangafranni. The only thing that isn't Mangafranni is the woman. \nDr. Mallory finally explodes. \nBarbara is disappearing into an elevator. Bock starts after her, then turns back to Lagerman. \nBOCK What do you mean, she died on the operating table in O.R. Three? \nThey hurry down the corridor to the elevators. \nBOCK You mean she was the one? \nLAGERMAN That's the one. I just identified her. \nBOCK What the hell's going on around here? Every time I try to find somebody in this hospital, they either died of a heart attack in Emergency or of anesthesia shock in an operating room. \nElevator doors open. A nurse and visitor get out. Bock and Lagerman go into... \nTHE ELEVATOR \nTwo or three people besides the elevator operator are there, as well as a patient on a stretcher and an orderly. \nLAGERMAN Listen, I just came from the O.R. They're trying to find a Dr. Schaefer. Don't you have a kid named Schaefer in your service? \nBOCK (scowls, mutters) I had a Schaefer. He died yesterday of an overdose of insulin. What do they want Schaefer for? \nLAGERMAN The Holding Room nurse says there was a Dr. Schaefer hanging around the Holding Room. It wouldn't have been your Schaefer anyway. The nurse says it was senior staff, a middle- aged man. \nBOCK There's no senior staff named Schaefer in this hospital. \nLAGERMAN I told them that. I said, I don't know any senior staff around here named Schaefer. They've got detectives down there, everything. It's a whole big investigation. \nThe elevator stops at the seventh floor. The doors open and Bock and Lagerman stroll into... \nHOLLY PAVILION, SEVENTH FLOOR, CORRIDOR \nBock lumbers down the west corridor, turns into... \nROOM 806 \nWilliam Mead, sedated and apparently zonked out cold, is being transferred from a stretcher back into bed by an O.R. orderly and nurse's aid. Bock rolls back the curtains around Drummond's bed revealing the comatose patient, his face sculptured against the white pillow, an I.V. tube in his right arm, a catheter projecting from under the sheet. Bock lowers the protective railing, leans in, takes the man's pulse on his neck, raises one closed eyelid, then the other. The pupils stare vacuously back at him; the eyelids drop closed as soon as they are released. \nIn the background, the orderly and aid finish tucking in William Mead and exit, wheeling their creaking stretcher out. The room is shockingly silent. Bock goes to the window and frowns in thought. \nHOLD ACROSS the patient Drummond, on Bock in the background at the window with his back to us. Suddenly, Drummond's eyes open. He lies rigid, his eyes staring dementedly into the air above him. \nSlowly, his left hand reaches out and carefully withdraws the catheter from his bladder, lays it on the white sheet beside him, and silently reaches over to withdraw the I.V. needle from his right arm. He lets the needle dangle, dripping onto the bed. Carefully, he twists out from under his sheet, swings his legs over the side of the bed and sits up. \nREVERSE ACROSS Bock at the window, pondering. With a swift lash of movement, the double tubes of a stethoscope are whipped over his head and tightened around his throat. \nDRUMMOND (mad as a hatter) I am the Fool for Christ and the Paraclete of Caborca. \nCLOSE TWO SHOT of Bock being strangled, Drummond's face frozen in bland dementia behind him. \nBARBARA'S VOICE (off-screen) For heaven's sake, Dad! What the hell's going on? \nDrummond pauses in his strangling and, releasing the poor man altogether, turns to his daughter in the doorway. \nCAMERA DOLLIES to include all three -- Bock recuperating; Drummond staring madly; and Barbara infuriated with her father. \nBARBARA (annoyed) We all thought you were at Death's Door! What're you doing out of bed? \nDrummond, abashed, stands there, a scolded schoolboy, a rawboned figure in a hospital shift, a stethoscope dangling from his right hand. \nBARBARA (to Bock) What happened? Did he say anything to you? \nBOCK (sufficiently recovered) As a matter of fact, he said, \"I am the Fool for Christ and the Paraclete of Caborca.\" And you'd better close the door, because if he's going to tell everyone who walks in here he's the Fool for Christ and the Paraclete of Caborca, they'll put us all away. He's already killed two doctors and one nurse. \nSCHAEFER (on phone) Hey Sheila, this is Howard, Sheila. Hey listen, I got us a bed for tonight. A real, honest-to-god bed. \nROOM 806. NIGHT \nREPRISE the scene originally played UNDER CREDITS where Dr. Schaefer and his girlfriend Sheila sneak into the room and undress. Giggles and shushings, gooses and fondles. \nSHEILA Boy, I sure hope nobody walks in. \nDuring the replay, however, an additional segment is added. At one point, the girl, hanging her dress in the armoire, turns and holds something up. \nSHEILA What's this in your pocket? \nSCHAEFER That's my insulin. Put it back. \nSHEILA What do you take insulin for? Diabetes? I didn't know you were a diabetic. \nSCHAEFER It ain't contagious, don't worry about it. \nThey head for the unoccupied bed. CLOSE-UP on Drummond's profile. \nROOM 806 \nDark, hushed. Schaefer's girl is leaving; she tiptoes to the door, peeks out. Apparently, the coast is clear. She quickly slips out. \nROOM 806. DAY \nDrummond on his chair. Barbara perched on one side of her father's bed, Bock on the other. William Mead sleeps on. \nBOCK And you put Schaefer's insulin into the I.V. jar. \nDRUMMOND Yes. And then a second nurse came and plugged the I.V. jar into Schaefer. God clearly intended a measure of irony here. The hospital was to do all the killing for me. All I need do was arrange for the doctors to become patients in their own hospital. Accordingly, the next morning, I set out for Dr. Ives. I put on Dr. Schaefer's uniform, pinched some digoxine from the pharmacy and a sandbag from a utility cart, and found my way to Dr. Ives' laboratory. I coshed him with the sandbag, gave him a massive shot of the digoxine. This, you see, brought on an instant condition of cardiac arrhythmia. When he came to, I brought him down to the Emergency Room. \nEMERGENCY ROOM AREA, LOBBY. DAY \nThe usual E.R. crush and motion goes on in the background. Drummond escorts an obviously ill Dr. Ives to the Admitting Room. Drummond's voice under the narration explains matters to Miss Aronovici at the desk. \nDRUMMOND This is Dr. Ives. He's in the Nephrology Lab. I was in there a little while ago, and he was suddenly taken ill, and I thought I'd better get him over here right away. \nDRUMMOND (off-screen) He had at that time perhaps an hour to live. Prompt treatment would have saved his life. \nThey go into the... \nEMERGENCY ADMITTING AND TREATMENT ROOMS \nIves, seated on a table in evident distress, breathes heavily. \nDRUMMOND (voice-off) As a staff doctor, he was seen without preliminaries... \nAn attendant takes his pulse, pressure and respiration. Ives collapses. \nDRUMMOND (voice-off) His vital signs were taken, an electrocardiogram... \nPAN SLOWLY across the Emergency Room to catch its state of contained febrility. Every curtained treatment room is occupied, including the storage room in the back. The triage nurse and a second nurse behind the desk are busy on the phones. The triage nurse takes the history of the first in a line of five people seeking admission even as she answers her phone. \nWe watch Miss Aronovici and the other nurse and Dr. Spezio and his two interns, the two attendants -- all busy with one patient or another. \nDRUMMOND (voice-off) ...which revealed occasional ventricular premature contractions. An intern took his history... \nACROSS Drummond, white-uniformed, standing in the back against the filing cabinets and linens, watching the the new patients trickle and crowd in. \nDRUMMOND (voice-off) ...and then he was promptly... \nAt the Admitting Desk, a MAN in his forties is being signed in by a uniformed cop. \nDRUMMOND To insure one full hour of uninterrupted privacy. \nBOCK Oh yes. \nDRUMMOND I got up, wheeled Miss Campanella off to the operating rooms, replaced her bed with Mrs. Mangafranni's, exchanged charts and identity bracelets. She died officially of anesthesia shock. But, in point of fact, she died because she was wearing another woman's identity. \nBARBARA (to Bock) God, what do we do now? Let me take him back to Mexico. It's a simple world there. If you turn him in, they'll just cage him in the Rockland State Hospital for the Criminally Insane. Let me take him back, Herb. \nBOCK Are you kidding? We'll both take him. I'm going with you! Get him dressed. We're getting out of here before the police put us all in Rockland State. \nDRUMMOND I haven't finished my work here. I have this Welbeck to dispose of. I am the angel of the bottomless pit and the wrath of the lamb. \nBARBARA Oh dear, he's having another revelation. \nBock holds Drummond's coat and hat and crosses to take his arm. He finds the entranced Drummond as rigid as a statue. \nBOCK Look, that ambulance must be here by now. You go down and get them. I'll give him a shot of something to knock him out. We'll take him to the airport in the ambulance. \nThey both hurry out of the room. Drummond remains enmarbled in his trance. CAMERA SUDDENLY MOVES DOWN to William Mead, whose eyes now open; he has heard it all. In background, Drummond, suddenly released from his catatonic trance, heads for the armoire and extracts the white trousers of Dr. Schaefer's uniform. He puts them on, tucking in the tails of his hospital shift. He notices William Mead staring at him. \nDRUMMOND You're hallucinating again. \nWilliam Mead just stares at Drummond. \nEIGHTH FLOOR, NURSES' STATION AND LOBBY AREA \nBock and Barbara come hurrying around the corner from the west corridor. Barbara heads for the elevators. Bock heads for the Nurses' Station. The Eighth Floor is going about its normal 1:15 P.M. activity. Mrs. Donovan is at her desk on the phone. \nMRS. DONOVAN ...Edwards never showed up. I'm short- staffed as hell. It's just me and Felicia. It's like Sunday. Nobody's here. \nDR. BIEGELMAN I'll be at lunch... \nA nurse's aid, a bathrobed patient and two of his visitors stroll by. It's the end of the lunch hour, when the kitchen workers bring used trays back. \nMRS. DONOVAN Yeah, you gotta send me somebody... Oh yeah? \nBock moves past Mrs. Donovan and into the pharmacy where we see him scouring the shelves for thorazine and a syringe. An elevator arrives, disgorging Milton Mead and his resident assistant, Thomas Hitchcock and, of all people, Dr. Richard Welbeck himself. Barbara and Dr. Biegelman go into the elevator. The doors close. Milton Mead and Hitchcock head for the west corridor. Welbeck, in his natty double-breasted suit and carrying his cashmere coat, heads straight for the Nurses' Station. \nMEAD We'll be in Eight-O-Six. \nMRS. DONOVAN (chuckles into phone) ...then what did she say? \nWELBECK (to Mrs. Donovan) I'm Dr. Welbeck. I have a patient on this floor named Drummond, and I'd like to see his chart. \nMRS. DONOVAN I'll call you back. \nBock immediately emerges from the pharmacy holding a bottle of thorazine and a wrapped hypodermic syringe. He scowls at Welbeck, who scowls back. \nWELBECK Oh, Dr. Bock. Can I have a few minutes of your time, sir? \nBOCK No. \nHe starts to pass Mrs. Donovan and would continue, but Welbeck lays a restraining hand on his arm. \nWELBECK Dr. Gilley tells me you're the one who initiated these proceedings against me. \nBOCK I'm busy, Welbeck. \nWELBECK I'd like to know what you have against me. \nBOCK You turned up half-stoned for a simple nephrectomy eight days ago, botched it, put the patient into failure and damn near killed him. Then, pausing only to send in your bill, you flew off on the wings of man to an island of sun in Montego Bay. This is the third time in two years we've had to patch up your patients; the other two died. You're greedy, unfeeling, inept, indifferent, self-inflating and unconscionably profitable. Aside from that, I have nothing against you. I'm sure you play a hell of a game of golf. What else do you want to know? \nWelbeck's pocket-beeper BEEPS. \nWELBECK (in background on phone) Oh my God, Arthur! What are you talking about? Have you talked to Dr. Hogan about this? \nBOCK And, on top of everything else, the other patient in your father's room overheard his whole confession and just told the Chief Administrator of the hospital. They're sending for the cops. \nREVERSE ACROSS Welbeck on phone at Nurses' Station. In the background, Bock and Barbara stare at him. \nWELBECK (almost apoplectic on phone) Oh, my God, Arthur. Well, who held title? Do the underwriters know about this yet?... Oh my God! Arthur, what're you waiting for? Arrest the son of a bitch! Turn him in!... Oh my God! When?... Of course, Arthur, call me right back. I'm at the Holly Pavilion, Eighth Floor. Please! Right away! \nHe hangs up. \nBOCK Are you all right, Welbeck? \nWELBECK All right?! That son of a bitch is trying to wipe me out! My partner, the eminent orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Noel Hogan, is a miserable thief. And he's trying to wipe me out! \nMRS. DONOVAN (extending a chart) Mr. Drummond's chart, Doctor. \nWELBECK (angrily seizes the chart) What room is it? \nMRS. DONOVAN Eight-O-Six. \nWELBECK I'm expecting a phone call. Put it straight through to me in that room. \nHe strides off angrily, followed by an anxious Bock and Barbara, for the... \nEIGHTH FLOOR, WEST CORRIDOR \nBock and Barbara hurry along in Welbeck's wake. \nWELBECK The son of a bitch has been draining the company with phony purchase orders on another company, of which, it now turns out, his wife is the principal stockholder! Transparent fraud! I'll send him up for twenty years! \nHe wrenches open the door of 806, marches in, followed by Bock and Barbara. \nEIGHTH FLOOR, ROOM \nWelbeck advances on William Mead's bed, since he is the only patient in the room. (Hitchcock is on the phone.) \nWELBECK Well, Drummond, you don't seem that much the worse for the wear. \nWilliam Mead stares dully at Welbeck. Then he looks dully at Bock. \nWELBECK (to Hitchcock) Would you mind using some other phone? I'm expecting an important call. \nWILLIAM MEAD What is this? Who... who is this guy? \nHITCHCOCK (on phone) Yes, well, I'll be at the Nurses' Desk, Sergeant. It would be futile for me to try to explain this to you over the phone. \nWELBECK (leafing through Drummond's chart) You've got a bit of fever, Drummond, but you're coming along very well. \nWILLIAM MEAD I'm not Drummond, you monkey! Drummond's the other bed! \nThe phone now BUZZES. Welbeck and Hitchcock both head for it. \nWELBECK That's mine. (on phone) It's Welbeck here... Yes, Arthur, go ahead... \nWilliam Mead is painfully trying to get off his bed. \nWILLIAM MEAD I'm getting out of this nuthouse! \nBOCK (pushing him gently back) All right, take it easy, Mr. Mead. \nHitchcock, satisfied the call is not for him, exits. \nWILLIAM MEAD I came in here just to get a lousy polyp cut out. \nHitchcock looks down at the sheeted figure hunched on the bed parked in the hallway and slowly pulls the sheet off his head. William Mead stares up at him like a hunted animal. Hitchcock covers Mead's head again. \nROOM 806 \nBock still massages, sweating bullets by now. Barbara works the ambu bag. Dr. Morse is feeling Welbeck's groin for his femoral pulse. \nDR. MORSE What do you have, Dr. Bock? \nBOCK Total cardiac arrest. \nP.A. SYSTEM (off-screen) Dr. Rigby. Dr. Rigby. Dr. Lilac. \nDR. MORSE How long has he been like this? \nBOCK About a minute. No pulse, no heartbeat, no respiration... \nIf we can see anything of Welbeck through other bodies, we notice almost all his clothes have been ripped off his body. Dr. Loomis replaces Barbara. \nDR. LOOMIS All right, I'll take over. \nThe two nursing supervisors have been getting the max cart ready, snapping up the gateleg-footrest and attaching the I.V. tube to the oxygen jar, and that to the ambu bag. \nBOCK Endotrachial tube. \nDONOVAN (rushing in background with others) I'm sorry, Doctor, but we have another emergency in 823. \nCHANDLER Endotrachial tube. \nDR. LOOMIS Shall we get him up on the cart? \nDR. MORSE Yeah. \nDrs. Loomis, Bock and Morse struggle to lift the the nearly naked dead weight of Dr. Welbeck up from the floor and onto the max cart. Dr. Morse has picked up Drummond's chart from the bed where Welbeck had left it. \nDR. MORSE All right, who is this patient? What's the story on this patient? \nCLOSE-UP of Bock trying to hoist Welbeck and looking up slowly. \nDR. MORSE Is this his chart, Dr. Bock? \nBock cocks his head to him. \nDR. MORSE What's his name? Drummond? \nBock looks across to Barbara, now helping out at the max cart. She looks back at Bock. She shrugs. He shrugs. They exchange a smile. \nBOCK Yes, his name's Drummond. That's his chart. \nStraining under the effort, the three doctors get Welbeck off the floor. \nDR. MORSE (studying the chart) Oh Christ, the poor son of a bitch just had a nephrectomy a week ago. \nMrs. Donovan exits into... \nEIGHTH FLOOR, WEST CORRIDOR \n...as Mrs. Donovan comes out, Hitchcock turns to her. \nHITCHCOCK Was it Drummond? \nMRS. DONOVAN Who else would it be? \nHitchcock silently thanks God. \nDRUMMOND (barely audible above the traffic rumbling heedlessly around him) Let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, for the age is closed, the season of the seventh seal is at hand! \nROOM 806 \nBock and Barbara slip through doctors and nurses, heading for the door. \nDR. MORSE Hang isopril, two in five hundred. Let's take one more crack with the paddles. Everybody back off the cart. \nBock, carrying two overcoats, and Barbara, wearing hers and carrying her father's valise, exit into... \nEIGHTH FLOOR, WEST CORRIDOR \n...as Bock and Barbara come out, the activity is normal, with the exception of William Mead's bed along the wall. Hitchcock and two overcoated men are in the hallway, and Hitchcock hurries to Bock. \nHITCHCOCK Is he dead? \nBOCK They can't get him out of fib. I don't think he'll make it. \nHITCHCOCK Thank God. (sighs, turns to the two detectives) This should close the case, Sergeant. \nBock and Barbara hurry toward the elevators. \nTHE HOSPITAL, HOLLY PAVILION, LOBBY \nThe small army of militants and activists has broken through the security into the lobby. Their entrance is greeted by one small scream from a woman in the lobby. A LEADER of the invading troop calls out. \nLEADER Everybody take it easy! Nobody's going to be hurt! We just want the Director! \nOthers in the troop shout reassurances, but it doesn't really reassure anybody. The lady in the gift shop closes her door and locks up. People crowd in a solid block in the doorway to the coffee shop to see what's going on. \nFrom the long tunnels of corridors, nurses, doctors, administrative personnel pause in their chores and errands and missions to watch the tide of events in the lobby. \nHOLLY PAVILION, EXECUTIVE CORRIDOR \nThe exit door is wrenched open, and Bock comes hurtling into the carpeted executive corridor toward the lobby, and at that moment the troop of militants come rumbling in from the other end. Every door of the corridor fills with secretaries and administrators unsure of what's happening. Then, Sundstrom elbows his way through the clutch of secretaries in his doorway and comes into the corridor. He regards the militants moving down the corridor toward him. \nSHOUTING CROWD We want Sundstrom! We want Sundstrom! Community control! Community control! Hip-hip-Hippocrates! Up with service! Down with fees! \nSUNDSTROM You people want to see me? \nFIRST MILITANT Yeah, baby, we want to see you... \nSECOND MILITANT We're taking over this hospital, man... \nSUNDSTROM I've had it up to here. I'm not dealing with this kind of cheap blackmail! \nLEADER Now look, man. Now wait a minute there! \nFIRST MILITANT We're looking for a hostage! \nLEADER Fourteen people just got arrested for doing... \nIn the background, one of their fellow revolutionaries speaks up... \nMAN Lookit, man, where's the TV camera? \n...but he's shut up by the Leader. \nLEADER Would you be cool, man? (now yelling) Fourteen people got arrested for doing nothing but living in their homes, which you people threw them out of. \nCROWD Right on! \nLEADER So now we're going to arrest you. We're going to hold you hostage and we ain't letting you go un... \n", "test1_input": "MRS. DONOVAN I think I'll just let Mrs. Christie tell you about it. \nBock lumbers off for the west corridor through a press of activity. Kitchen workers trundle creaking portable carts, nurse's aids and attendants pop in and out of doorways bearing trays and used dishes. A robed patient or two ambulates along the hall. Morning rounds have just started, which means a clump of white-jacketed, white-trousered young doctors are gathered in a gaggle at the far end. The group includes senior resident MONROE BRUBAKER, junior resident HARVEY BIEGELMAN, interns SAM CHANDLER and IRVING AMBLER and another medical student, all lounging outside a door discussing the condition of the patient within. \nChandler is presenting the case from a handful of notecards in his hand. The others lean against the walls, listening. They wear shirts and ties with the exception of Ambler, who is new to the floor and still in the canonical white tunic under his jacket. They are all in their twenties and have swinger sideburns and occasional mustaches. When he spots Dr. Bock, senior resident Brubaker turns the rounds over to Biegelman and joins Bock just outside 806. \nBRUBAKER (as he approaches, rolls his eyes) Oh boy. \nBOCK What happened? \nBRUBAKER I've seen some pretty good snafus, but this one... I mean, there's a certain splendor to this one. One of the night nurses, a float, thought Schaefer was a patient and plugged an I.V. into him. He was a diabetic, you know. \nBOCK What do you mean, a nurse plugged an I.V. into him? \nBRUBAKER Oh, it's really a screwed-up story, Doctor. You see, what happened was we had an old man in that bed who died last night, so the bed was available. And you know Schaefer. He's Sammy Stud. \nBOCK And he talked a nurse into zapping him on that bed. \nBRUBAKER I think it was a girl from hematology he's been running with. \nBOCK My God, it's a Roman farce. \nThe door to Room 806 opens, and an Assistant Administrator named HITCHCOCK pokes his head out. \nHITCHCOCK I thought I heard you out here, Doctor. (he too rolls his eyes heavenward in an expression of incredulity) \nBock makes a noise and goes into... \nROOM 806 \nAside from Hitchcock, the room includes MRS. CHRISTIE, the Director of Nurses, a fusty forty-six, in streetclothes; Head Night Nurse, Mrs. Reardon, in uniform; Head Evening Nurse, MRS. DUNNE, mid-fifties, who had apparently been called in from home because she's in mufti and wearing a winter coat; and, of course, the comatose patient and the dead Dr. Schaefer. Mrs. Christie is instructing the two nurses. \nMRS. CHRISTIE I'll need one from both of you, three copies, and I suggest you do that right now. The forms are in my office... \nMrs. Dunne, on the verge of tears, head bobbing, looks up to Bock. \nMRS. DUNNE I'm really so terribly sorry about this, Dr. Bock. I... \nBOCK (regarding Schaefer's rigid death mask) As I understand it, one of the nurses inadvertently administered an I.V. to Schaefer here. How the hell could that happen? \nHITCHCOCK Listen, I think we ought to straighten this out somewhere else. \nMRS. CHRISTIE Yes, very good idea. Oh God, what a mess. \nThey all file out now, Bock in the rear into... \nHALLWAY, NURSES' STATION AND LOBBY AREA \nThey all go along to the Nurses' Station where Mrs. Reardon and Mrs. Dunne disappear into the rooms behind. Mrs. Christie leads Hitchcock and the trailing Bock to the TV-solarium; but Dr. Brubaker is now holding his rounds there. He stands, quietly expounding on the uses of heparin, a decoagulant. One of the patients last night had hemorrhaged consequent to injudicious use of that drug. Listening, the other young doctors make notes. Mrs. Christie leans against the wall. Apparently, the conference is to take place in the corridor. Background activity continues normally. \nMRS. CHRISTIE (with a sigh) Well, these things happen, of course. \nHITCHCOCK I suppose I'd better call the Medical Examiner. \nBOCK I still don't know what happened. \nMRS. CHRISTIE Well, it took an hour to get it sorted out. It seems a patient named Guernsey died last night in Eight-O-Six, but that information wasn't given to the night nurses. These things happen. \nBock has begun to get the drift. A curious state of apathy settles over him. \nMRS. CHRISTIE (rattling on) At any rate, according to the cardex, the patient Guernsey was down for twenty-five milligrams of Sparine Q- 6-H, so Mrs. Reardon sent Nurse Perez to give him his twelve o'clock shot. Meanwhile, it seems Dr. Schaefer had usurped that particular bed for his own purposes. Dr. Brubaker suggests it was for a love tryst, and some weight is given that hypothesis by the fact that Dr. Schaefer was naked. \nBOCK (trying to give his attention to this) I get the drift, Mrs. Christie. In other words, Nurse Perez went in and sedated Dr. Schaefer thinking it was the patient Guernsey. My God! What I don't understand... \n", "test1_true": "BOCK So she plugged an I.V. into him. \nMRS. CHRISTIE Yes. \nBOCK How much? \nMRS. CHRISTIE A liter. \nBOCK (The doctor in him intrudes into his lassitude) A five percent glucose solution won't kill anybody. Did he have any other ancillary conditions? He wasn't dehydrated, was he? Didn't anybody bother to go in to check him during the night, even under the impression he was merely a patient? Was he hyperasthmolic? Did he have a bad heart? He must have had some kind of thrombosis. I want the post done here, Mr. Hitchcock. And you and I better have a little chat, Mrs. Christie, about your excessive use of float nurses. \nMRS. CHRISTIE I've got nearly a thousand nurses in this hospital. \nBOCK (gathering rage) And every time one of them has her period, she disappears for three days. My doctors complain regularly they can't find the same nurse on the same floor two days in a row. What the hell am I supposed to tell that boy Schaefer's parents? That a substitute nurse assassinated him, because she couldn't tell the doctors from the patients on the floor? My God, the incompetence here is absolutely radiant! I mean, two separate nurses walk into a room, stick needles into a man -- and one of those was a number eighteen jelco! -- tourniquet the poor sonofabitch, anchor the poor sonofabitch's arm with adhesive tape, and it's the wrong poor sonofabitch! I mean, my God! Where do you train your nurses, Mrs. Christie? Dachau!? (he is aware his voice has risen and is attracting attention. He lowers his voice) All right, wrap him up and get him down to Pathology. I'm especially interested in his blood sugar. A liter of glucose never killed anybody. Your ladies must've done something else to him. \nMRS. CHRISTIE Will there be anything else, Doctor? \nBOCK No. \nHITCHCOCK Before you call the family, Doctor, I wish you'd talk to Mr. Mead about this. We'd like, naturally, to avoid litigation. \nBock heads abruptly down the corridor to the elevators. \nHOLLY PAVILION, SEVENTH FLOOR, CORRIDOR \nA corridor of offices. This is the Department of Medicine, where Bock and all the senior staff members of the department have their offices. It's quiet, since most of the staff are away at their various specialties about the hospital. \nBock comes up the corridor still wearing the overcoat he arrived in some hours ago. He has only managed to unbutton it in all the time it has taken him to reach the corner office. Gilt lettering on the door reads: DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE and below that DR. HERBERT E. BOCK. \nBOCK'S OFFICE, OUTER OFFICE \nSmall office with two desks. As Department Chief, Bock gets two secretaries. Both are at their desks, one on the phone, MISS GLORIA LEBOW, and the other rattling away on the IBM, MISS STEPHANIE McGUIRE. \nMISS LEBOW (mouthing) Coffee? \nIt would seem not. Bock waves a listless hand, exits into... \nBOCK'S PRIVATE OFFICE \nThe modestly imposing office is lined with medical tomes. Bock slips out of his coat and jacket and hangs them in the closet. In shirtsleeves with his tie a bit askew -- fastidiousness in dress is not Bock's strong point -- he crosses to his desk and sits, breathing more heavily than his small exertions would seem to warrant. He seems exhausted. There is a KNOCK on the door. Miss Lebow enters, holding a filing envelope stuffed with papers. \nMISS LEBOW A few things have been piling up. Would you like to go into them? \nA guttural noise indicates yes. Miss Lebow pulls up a chair, opens her folder. \nMISS LEBOW A quickie. Dr. Esterhazy wants to start hiring temporary people to cover the summer vacations. He says last year some of the replacement people didn't receive their checks until they waited six months. He wonders if you could do something about getting these people paid more promptly. \nShe places a sheet of paper on the desk in front of Bock. He tries to give his attention to it. \nMISS LEBOW (drones on) Miss Aronovici complains the lab reports are coming in slow into the E.R. I called Dr. Immelman about that, and she said three microscopes have been stolen out of her lab in the last two months. Charley Waters also complains about pilferage. I've clumped all those together for you... (she lays a sheaf of memos in front of Bock, who stares at them blankly) Now, as you know, Doctor, we've agreed to take over the local ambulance cases as part of the hospital's commitment to the community, and it's created a serious overload in the E.R. I don't know why this was dumped in our lap, but... \nBock obviously isn't up to all this. He waves a limp hand to stop Miss Lebow's morning report. \nBOCK (staring at his desktop) Find out if Dr. Einhorn is in his office yet. \nMISS LEBOW Which Dr. Einhorn? Ophthalmology or Psychiatry? \nBOCK Psychiatry. (suddenly stands) Never mind. I'll look in myself. \nHe lumbers across the room and out into... \nBOCK'S OUTER OFFICE \n", "test1_id": 2058, "test2_input": "...and down past Miss McGuire, rattling away on her IBM, and out into... \nHOLLY PAVILION, SEVENTH FLOOR, CORRIDOR \n...down past several closed doors, stopping at a door marked DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHIATRY, DR. JOSEPH EINHORN. He enters. \nDR. EINHORN'S OFFICE, SECRETARY'S OFFICE \nA secretary at her desk, sips coffee and reads a paperback novel. \nBOCK Is he in? \nThe doctor is obviously in. He can be seen through the open door sitting at his desk writing in a notebook. Bock leans in. \nBOCK Can you give me a few minutes, Joe? \nEINHORN (short, chunky, bespectacled, late fifties) Of course. \nBock goes in, closes the door behind himself. \nDR. EINHORN'S OFFICE \nBock looks only at the floor. \nBOCK (ill at ease) I've been having periods of acute depression recently. Apparently, it's becoming noticeable. A number of people have remarked on it. Anyway, John Sundstrom thought it might be a good idea if I spoke to you about it. \nEINHORN Do you want to sit down, Herb? \nBOCK No. I'm not good at confessional. (he ambles around) Well, what can I tell you? The last year, two, three... it goes way back, I suppose. I can remember entertaining suicidal thoughts as a college student. At any rate, I've always found life demanding. I'm an only child of lower-middle-class people. I was the glory of my parents. My son the doctor. Well, you know. I was always top of my class. Scholarship to Harvard. The boy genius, the brilliant eccentric. Terrified of women, clumsy at sports. God, Joe, how the hell do I go about this? \nEINHORN I understand you just separated from your wife. \nBOCK I left her a dozen times. She left me a dozen times. We stayed together through a process of attrition. Obviously sado-masochistic dependency. My home is hell. We've got a twenty- three-year-old boy I threw out of the house last year. A shaggy-haired Maoist. I don't know where he is, presumably building bombs in basements as an expression of his universal brotherhood. I've got a seventeen- year-old daughter who's had two abortions in two years and got arrested last week at a rock festival for pushing drugs. They let her off. The typical affluent American family. I don't mean to be facile about this. \nIndeed, he does not. He is horrified by the fact his eyes are wet and he is verging on tears. He turns away quickly. \nBOCK I blame myself for those two useless young people. I never exercised parental authority. I'm no good at that. Oh, God, I'm no good at this either. Joe, let's just forget the whole thing. I'm sorry I bothered you. \nHe starts for the door. \nEINHORN How serious are your suicidal speculations, Herb? \nBOCK (at the door) I amuse myself with different ways of killing myself that don't look like suicide. I wouldn't want to do my family out of the insurance. \nEINHORN Digitalis will give you an arrhythmia. \nBOCK A good toxologist would find traces. Potassium's much better. Sixty milli equivalent. Instantaneous. Of course, then you're stuck with how to get rid of the hypodermic. Forty milli equivalent. Gives you plenty of time to dispose of the evidence. \nEINHORN You seem to have given considerable thought to the matter. \nBOCK You ought to know a man who talks about it all the time never does it. \nEINHORN I don't know. I see a man who's exhausted, emotionally drained, riddled with guilt, and has been systematically stripping himself of his wife, children, friends, isolating himself from the world. Are you impotent? \nBOCK Intermittently. \nEINHORN What does that mean? \nBOCK It means I haven't tried in so long, I don't know. Let's just drop the whole thing, Joe. I feel humiliated and stupid. All I have to do is pull myself together and get back into my work. I'm sorry I troubled you. Take care of yourself. I'll see you. \nBefore Einhorn can say a word, he slips away and disappears into his own office. \nHOLLY PAVILION. 8:30 A.M. \n", "test2_true": "HOLLY PAVILION, LOBBY \nIves cuts through the congestion of people and moves swiftly up the long corridor leading to the Farkis Building, unbuttoning his overcoat as he goes into... \nTHE FARKIS BUILDING, FIFTH FLOOR \n...and comes out, as the elevator opens. This is a laboratory floor, and the corridors are empty except for a white- uniformed orderly leaning against a wall and for one young woman in a white smock in the background, who waves to the young man before disappearing into one of the rooms. Ives fishes out a ring of keys and unlocks the door to his own lab. He enters into... \nFARKIS BUILDING, NEPHROLOGY LAB \nDingy and cheerless place, as labs go. Ives hangs his coat in the cupboard, loosens his tie, unbuttons his suit jacket, squats on a stool, reaches over for a loose file on the work table, opens the file and begins to read the papers inside. \nA door CLICKS open behind him, and without looking up, he waves briefly to whoever has entered. CAMERA DOLLIES to FULL SHOT of Ives frowning over his notes. We are suddenly conscious of a white-uniformed presence behind him. We know it's medical personnel, but we can't see the face. Ives starts to turn to the presence behind him, when suddenly a small hospital sandbag is whipped down on his head, and he slumps forward, his forehead thumping against the black surface of the lab table. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nHOSPITAL. NOON \nHIGH ANGLE SHOT establishing the passing of hours. Sun high overhead, traffic on First Avenue an impenetrable river of HONKS and HOOTS. At a crosswalk, a loose procession of fifty or so shouting demonstrators, bearing placards, flows toward the main gates. Their posters read: \"FIGHT DOPE -- NOT DOPES!\" \"DRUGS YES! TRANSPLANTS NO!\" and \"SAVE OUR KIDS FROM THE SKIDS!\" which is what they now chant: \"Save our kids! From the Skids!\" The demonstration moves through a handful of city cops where our original group of twenty still ramble around, chanting: \"Two -- Four! Help the Poor!\" \nHOLLY PAVILION, EIGHTH FLOOR \nThe staff elevator doors open and Bock comes out, wearing his long white doctor's coat unbuttoned. Hanging about the Nurses' Station are Dr. Brubaker and a few young men in white. They come quickly to respectful attention at Bock's entrance. CLATTERING TRAYS dominate the lunchtime atmosphere. \nBOCK All set? \nBRUBAKER Yes, sir. \nThe doctors move off toward the solarium on the east corridor overlooking the river. They pass a curious quartet of people consisting of a very handsome YOUNG WOMAN in her late twenties in an out-of-fashion miniskirt (She has great legs, long and tanned.); an ELDERLY MAN, uncomfortable in city clothes and unmistakably an INDIAN; a tall overcoated man in his forties wearing a MINISTER's white collar; and a DISTINGUISHED MAN dressed in fashionable gray who is trying to persuade the young woman of something. The young woman and the Indian stand absolutely still, silent, impassive. The minister is more fidgety. \nBOCK (to Brubaker en passant) Who's that exotic group? \nBRUBAKER (murmurs) You got me. They've been here about an hour. \nONE YOUNG DOCTOR I think they're with the old man in Eight-O-Six. \nBock and Brubaker, trailed by young doctors, move into the TV room. \nBOCK Dr. Perry said he picked the tuberculosis and the liver nodes for today, right? \nBRUBAKER Yes, sir. \nBOCK Good. Because that's the one I studied up. A hell of a case. \nEIGHTH FLOOR, TV ROOM \nSome twenty-five or thirty young doctors, two or three of them black, three or four of them women, fill the room. At Bock's entrance, they find places around the walls, sofas, soft chairs and benches. The TV set has been pushed into a corner, and a large portable blackboard has been set up. This is the Chief of Service Round, attended by every available intern and resident. Somebody closes the door, just as two young doctors come hurrying in. \nBOCK All right, who's presenting? \nEMERGENCY AREA, WAITING ROOM \nPeople of all ages sit around on aluminum chairs arranged around the walls of the room. All are in streetclothes. Some speak to each other. A line of people, extending into the hallway and holding their charts, waits for a lady from the accounting department taking Blue Cross numbers. This lady from accounting is MRS. CUSHING, late forties, bespectacled and testy. She calls out at large. \nMRS. CUSHING Is there anybody seated who hasn't been to see me first? Is there anyone here who hasn't given me their health insurance number? \nHer phone RINGS. She picks it up. \nMRS. CUSHING Emergency Room... Well, I don't know, Sybil. What's his name? \nTo a man on line at her desk, thrusting his chart out to her. \n", "test2_id": 2059, "test3_input": "AMBLER (nervous) Some sort of embolic phenomena, sir. \nBOCK Good. \nSUTCLIFFE (flagging Brubaker) Dr. Brubaker, I wonder if I could see you for a moment? \nBrubaker detaches himself from his group to join Sutcliffe. CAMERA STAYS with Bock and his entourage, following them down the east corridor, Bock still happily conducting class. Bock strides into... \nROOM 819 \nPast two beds, they group around the foot of a third bed on the right side of the room. Bock checks the patient lying in the bed. \nBOCK Still a little icteric. Who's got an opthalmoscope? \nOne of the young men hands his to Bock, who leans over the patient to look through it. \nBOCK Did anyone note Roth spots? \nThe doctors exchange a look as Bock rises, moves toward them, laughing. \nBOCK Well, don't worry about it. There aren't any. Ambler, you're our big man on S.B.E. What was the latex- fixation? \nBIEGELMAN It wasn't done, sir. \nBOCK Don't you think that's an important test to differentiate S.B.E. from miliary T.B.? \nBIEGELMAN (off-screen) No, s... \nBOCK Not you, Biegelman. Ambler. \nAMBLER Well, there's about a seventy percent incidence of false-positive latex in S.B.E. \nBock hands the opthalmoscope to Ambler. \nBOCK You have been reading up. If the diagnosis were S.B.E., would a positive latex indicate anything in the therapy? \nAMBLER We'd expect the latex to become negative. \nBOCK If...? \nAMBLER If the antibiotic therapy were successful. \nBOCK Are you applying for your internship here? \nAMBLER I'm not sure. \nBOCK Come and see me. (to the patient, helping her up) Would you sit up for a minute? \nBock turns to the off-screen patient, helping her sit up and forward, percussing her back as the students look on. \nEIGHTH FLOOR, EAST CORRIDOR \nBrubaker and Sutcliffe are now both involved in discussion with the woman, the Indian and the minister, as Bock drifts through the background, followed by the band of young doctors now dispersing. Bock crosses past the foreground group to the staff elevator. He pushes the button. Brubaker approaches Bock. They confer quietly in the hallway. \nBRUBAKER We've got a little thing over here, Doctor. The girl over there is the daughter of the patient in Eight-O- Six. He is at the moment comatose and requires intravenous feeding and meds. \nThe elevator comes and goes, disgorging some, taking on others. Bock, who greeted Brubaker with a rare, benign smile, has begun to look a bit sodden. Poor Brubaker, aware of the gathering storm in Bock's demeanor, sighs and continues regardless. \nBRUBAKER The thing is, the daughter wants to take the father out of the hospital and back to Mexico where they live. The patient's name is Drummond. He's apparently a Methodist missionary, and he and his daughter run some kind of religious mission among the Apache Indians. The daughter claims to be a licensed nurse, so she can give the necessary I.V. treatment. I certainly don't think he should be let out of this hospital. The Attending -- he's the guy in gray over there -- concurs. \nBock squints at Brubaker. \nBOCK All right, wait a minute. Let me have all that again. \n", "test3_true": "BOCK Never mind the professional ethics, what happened? \nBRUBAKER (sighs) I don't know why I'm covering for that sonofabitch in Farkis Pavilion anyway. (sighs and begins) The patient, a man of fifty-six, was admitted to the hospital ten days ago for a check-up, in good health, no visible distress. We did the mandatory work-up on him. Blood cultures, stool, L.E. preps, chest, E.K.G., all negative. But there was apparently some evidence of protein in his urine. I don't know how that sonofabitch in Farkis Pavilion ever found out about it. Maybe he had some kind of deal with one of the girls in the lab. Anyway, he turned up the next day, conned the patient into signing an authorization for a biopsy... \nBOCK What sonofabitch in Farkis Pavilion? \nBRUBAKER Some post-grad fellow named Ives. Elroy Ives. I never met him. He's on one of the immunology research programs. \nBOCK Are you trying to tell me some post- grad fellow came up here and did a biopsy on the patient? \nBRUBAKER Yes, sir. He conned Biegelman with that old story about... \nBOCK ...protein in the urine? \nBRUBAKER Yes, sir. \nBOCK And he biopsied the man? \nBRUBAKER And he nicked a vessel, and at two o'clock in the morning, they woke up Biegelman because the nurse found the patient in shock. Biegelman called the kidney people for a consult right away. What was there to see? The man was sour and bleeding. We spoke to this fellow Sutcliffe, and he referred us to a surgeon named Welbeck... \nBOCK Welbeck?! That barber! \nBRUBAKER You ain't heard nothing yet. So we finally got Welbeck around four in the morning. He said, go ahead. So they laid on the surgery for eight. Welbeck turns up, half-stoned, orders an I.V.P., clears him for allergies... \nBOCK ...without actually testing. \nBRUBAKER Right. \nBOCK And the patient went into shock... \nBRUBAKER ...and tubular necrosis. They lopped out the bleeding kidney, ran him back to the room, and we sat around waiting for three days to see how obstructed he was. Fever began spiking like hell, euremia, vomiting, so we arranged hemodialysis. He's putting out good water now. But some nurse goofed on his last treatment. A leak in the tube, something. His blood pressure plunged. They ran him right up to I.C.U., checked out vital signs, all normal except he's comatose. That was two days ago. \nBOCK In short, a man came into this hospital in perfectly good health, and, in the space of one week, we chopped out one kidney, damaged the other, reduced him to coma and damn near killed him. \nBRUBAKER Yes, sir. \nA great sad serenity has settled over Bock. \nBOCK You know, Brubaker, last night I sat in my hotel room, reviewing the shambles of my life and contemplating suicide. Then I said \"No, Bock, don't do it. You're a doctor, a healer. You're the Chief of Medicine at one of the great hospitals of the world. You're a necessary person. Your life is meaningful.\" Then I came in this morning and find out one of my doctors was killed by a couple of nurses who mistook him for a patient because he screwed a technician from the nephrology lab... \nBRUBAKER Hematology, sir. \nBOCK And now you come to me with this gothic horror story in which the entire machinery of modern medicine has apparently conspired to destroy one lousy patient. How am I to sustain my feeling of meaningfulness in the face of this? You know, Brubaker, if there was an oven around, I'd stick my head in it. What was the name of that sonofabitch from Farkis Pavilion again? \nBRUBAKER Ives, sir. Elroy Ives. Somebody ought to ream his ass. \nThe gathering storm erupts. Rage suffuses Bock's face. Out of respect for the hospital corridor and the people working around him and Brubaker, he keeps it glacial. But there is no mistaking the volcanic fury he feels. \nBOCK (barely containing himself) I'm going to ream his ass. And I'm going to break that barber Welbeck's back.

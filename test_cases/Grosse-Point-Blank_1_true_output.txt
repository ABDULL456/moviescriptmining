CUT TO: 
CLOSE-UP - A FULL, FEMALE MOUTH 
lit only by dime slivers of sunlight, in front of a microphone. Stray, gossamer strands of hair hanging in her face move in front of her mouth as she speaks.... 
FEMALE DEEJAY --and I'm ready for some good tunes and angry talk. Or angry tunes and good talk-- 
CUT TO: 
MARTIN 
looking somewhere far away, beyond what is before him in the windshield... 
FEMALE DEEJAY (V.O.) --Or maybe we'll just play the Cocteau Twins and get over the goo-angry- talking music. As you know-- 
CUT TO: 
THE DEEJAY'S HANDS 
as they distractedly toy with the wire at the base of the mic. 
FEMALE DEEJAY (V.O.) --for some moments in life there are no words, and a little nonsense now and then is relished by the wisest man-- 
CUT TO: 
MARTIN 
still rapt, makes a sharp turn into a shopping district. 
CUT TO: 
HER MOUTH 
FEMALE DEEJAY --The Cocteau Twins, though also a band of the nineties, will be aired due to the fact that they created their own language to sing by-- 
CUT TO: 
MARTIN 
slows on a quaint street of cute shops. He creeps up to a storefront on hid right and stops, staring through the passenger window.... 
CUT TO: 
DEBI NEWBERRY 
the female deejay. She sits slumped in a well-worn executive chair, her back to the studio console and the picture window behind it that opens to the street.... 
DEBI --Now that's freedom-- 
she swivels in the chair to face the street.... 
DEBI'S P.O.V. 
of Martin's Town Car outside, Martin silhouetted in shadow. 
DEBI 
Her brow furrowed as she peers at the car, something summoned by the dark figure. Her words falter almost imperceptibly. 
DEBI --The best I can do is a rhyme: Where are all the good men dead? In the heart or in the head? Back later.... 
MARTIN 
Shaken from his trance by her stare, pulls back into the street and disappears.... 
INT. MARTIN'S CAR - MORNING 
Martin drives, listening to the radio. He turns the corner with an expectant look on his face. Suddenly his face drops as he slows and pulls over.... 
MARTIN'S P.O.V. - 7-11 STORE

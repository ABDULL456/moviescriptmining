{"train": "SUPER 8 \nWritten by \nJ.J. Abrams \nFINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT December 16, 2010 \nOVER BLACK WE HEAR THE DULL SOUNDS OF INDUSTRY; A MUFFLED MASS OF MACHINES, GEARS, STEAM. FADE IN ON: \nA SIGN. Twelve feet across. Painted decades earlier, grim- covered black, white and red. It reads in large 40's era, hand-painted type, \"SAFETY IS OUR PRIMARY CONCERN!\" Then: \"DAYS SINCE LAST ACCIDENT\" and below that, NUMBERS, painted on hanging metal cards. Four possible digits can hang here, but there are currently three: \"784.\" \nSLOWLY PUSH IN on this sign as a MAN APPEARS, rising on a forklift, in a greasy, monochromatic work jumpsuit. Removes the \"4\" from its hooks. Then removes the \"8.\" Then the \"7.\" \nFinally, he hangs up a number. \"1.\" \nThe man LOWERS out of frame as we creep even closer to the hanging single digit, wondering about the accident... and how bad it was and the FACTORY SOUNDS GROW DEAFENING -- AND AS IT BUILDS TO A CRESCENDO, WE CUT TO SILENT BLACKNESS. \nEXT. JOE'S HOUSE - PORCH - DAY \nShiny black loafers. Black pants, three inches too long. We BOOM UP, stopping at a boy's hand reaching into the black suit jacket pocket. Pulls out a WOMAN'S GOLD NECKLACE with a LOCKET. He holds the locket. Rubs it gently with his thumb. CONTINUE TO BOOM UP. We now SEE THE BOY'S FACE. \nThis is JOE LAMB, 14. On the precarious edge of adulthood. He looks out at the horizon with stricken eyes. \nHe moves forward and we PAN, so we're BEHIND HIM NOW. In the frosty distance, past countless leafless trees and modest homes, is a STEEL MILL. Smokestacks and structures. The lifeblood of this late 70's town. \nINT. LAMB LIVING ROOM - DAY \nClose on CHARLES' MOTHER AND FATHER, funeral attire. She looks out of the window sadly; heartsick and concerned. Behind her, he picks at his plate of food. \nCHARLES' MOTHER I'm so worried for that boy. \nCHARLES' FATHER Joe's gonna be okay. \nCHARLES' MOTHER ...she was everything to him. \nCHARLES' FATHER Jack's gonna step up. He's a good man. \nCHARLES' MOTHER But he was never really a father...I don't think he ever...understood Joe. \nCHARLES' FATHER (maybe a little concerned HIMSELF) Joe's gonna be okay. \nBut his wife isn't so sure. \nThen, BOYS' HUSHED VOICES: \nINT. LAMB DINING ROOM - DAY \nCHARLES (we'll see him in a moment) LEANS FORWARD, reaching for food on a buffet table. Charles' leaning has revealed CARY, a blonde kid in a dark blue sport jacket and tie, and PRESTON, pale and smart, in a DARK SWEATER: \nCARY What do you think was in the coffin? \nMARTIN Jesus, shut up. \nCARY I mean cause of how she died. \nCARY (CONT'D) ... you weren't wondering that? \nPRESTON No, I'm eating macaroni salad. \nWe now see CHARLES, big and in an ill-fitting BLACK SUIT, and MARTIN, good looking, in a shirt and tie, at the buffet: \nCHARLES I was thinking that, about the coffin. \nMARTIN I don't know how you guys can eat. \nCHARLES Try a Goddamn turkey roll and you'll discover how. They're delicious. \nCUT WIDE TO REVEAL that we are in a modest Ohio house in the year 1979. At a wake. Forty-odd friends and neighbors, darkly dressed. Quiet discussions. Some crying. \nCARY Either nothing was in there, or like whatever they scraped up-- \nMARTIN Jesus -- guys-- \nCHARLES MARTIN I heard it crushed her completely. At least keep your voices DOWN-- \nPRESTON CHARLES A steel beam-- those things weigh a ton. Literally. If it had been open casket, I would not be eating right now. Despite the turkey rolls. \nJACK (O.S.) Hey-- Lucy. \nThey look up -- in the other room, a dog (mutt, Lucy) has jumped on a guest, for food. JACKSON LAMB, Joe's father, 42, black suit, moves to the dog, walks her out of shot. \nINT. 7-ELEVEN - DAY - CONTINUOUS \nJoe, Charles and Cary scan the candy aisle. \nJOE -- driving where? \nCHARLES JOE To the train depot -- did you not read the scene I just gave you? Does Alice have a license? Is she old enough? Whose car are we taking? Are you making this up? \nCHARLES Jesus, Freak Show, she offered to drive and I accepted-- \nCARY (takes scene pages) Can I see --? \nJOE -- was she nice? Why is she doing this? I don't understand, we don't even know her-- \nCHARLES Maybe she just wants to be in a good movie, y'ever think of that? \nJOE I don't think that's what it is-- \nCHARLES I've been working on this movie for months. I'm just trying to make it good. \nCARY (reading, disapproving) Hathaway's married now? Really? \nCharles swipes the pages from critic Cary. \nJOE What was she reading? \nCHARLES ... what? \nJOE In the silent reading section, what was Alice reading? \nCHARLES Who gives a rat's ass what she was reading-- the festival deadline's in one week -- my movie's gotta be great! \nCHARLES' SUPER 8 MOVIE BEING PROJECTED ON A MOVIE SCREEN. SLOWLY PUSH IN ON THE SCREEN: kids earnestly playing adults: \nINT. BUILDING 47 - DAY (SUPER 8) \nDARKNESS. Then a DOOR OPENS. It's DETECTIVE HATHAWAY (played by MARTIN), in silhouette. He enters. It's an old WAREHOUSE, dirty, cobwebbed, crowded with CRATES, old MACHINERY, CHEMICAL BARRELS and JUNK. The Detective turns on his FLASHLIGHT -- aims it -- sweeps it across the space -- the light HITTING THE LENS for a moment. \nThe Detective walks through the spooky, dark space. A low, growling industrial DRONE makes the whole place oddly creepy. Then: A SOUND -- quick but strange -- slithering -- and the Detective aims his flashlight -- tense. He watches. Waits. We see where he's aiming the light, which cuts through THICK DUST in the air. It's an old office door, ajar. \nHathaway is still. Nervous. Watching the door -- waiting for it to open... and then -- from the darkness BEHIND HIM -- a terrifying open-mouthed ZOMBIE APPEARS -- ATTACKS -- and the Detective TURNS -- his flashlight KNOCKED TO THE GROUND -- and Hathaway falls too -- the wild-eyed gaping-mouthed Zombie DROOLING as it tries to bite Hathaway's flesh -- we recognize that the Zombie is CARY. Actually, not a bad performance. The Detective pulls out his GUN -- but the Zombie grabs his wrist -- they wrestle with the gun -- the Zombie wanting to rip into Hathaway's neck -- but Hathaway sees three SHARP-TIPPED NAILS sticking out of an old piece of WOODEN CRATE -- and after a significant struggle, Hathaway PUSHES THE ZOMBIE BACK so his head is IMPALED BY THE NAILS -- which we see ENTER HIS SKULL!!! The Zombie (stuck to the crate via the nails) SCREAMS AND DIES and just at Hathaway catches his breath THE IMAGE DIMS AND FREEZES; the projector has just been STOPPED. We are in: \nINT. CHARLES' ROOM - DAY \nBoard games, books, records, a stereo, toys, and magic. Super 8 film equipment and paraphernalia. Movie ONE SHEETS hang: CARRIE, HALLOWEEN, EARTHQUAKE and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. No sports memorabilia. Charles turns on the lights, looks anxiously at Joe: \nJACK That was a good zombie murder. \nCHARLES Yeah, but it's not a st-- thank you for that-- it's not a story yet. (MORE) CHARLES (CONT'D) Older kids enter this film festival -- I'm competing with fifteen- and sixteen-year-olds, who have better stories and cars and production value, I've got nothing! \nCHARLES' MOTHER (O.S.) Charles! Dinner! \nAs he tosses Joe a SUPER 8 FILMMAKER MAGAZINE: \nCHARLES I'm coming! (TO JOE) There's a whole article in there about stories, you should read it, it explains everything. \nJOE (looks at magazine) I don't understand how the wife makes it a story-- \nCHARLES CHARLES' MOTHER (O.S.) Jesus, that's what I've been explaining: in the scene we're filming tonight, the wife telling the detecting she's scared for him, that she loves him-- Charles! -- I'M COMING!!! -- so when he investigates the zombie stuff you'll be scares -- you'll feel something -- because you don't want him to die because they love each other! Does that make sense? \nJOE (CONT'D) I just can't believe you talked to Alice Dainard. \nCHARLES You're impossible. \nCHARLES' MOTHER (O.S.) CHARLES! \nCHARLES GOD, MOM! I'M COMING! (opens the door, whispers) Midnight. Okay? Don't forget. \nJOE I won't forget. \nCHARLES Read this. \nJoe just nods and looks at the magazine. \nINT. CHARLES' KITCHEN - DUSK \nA hectic FAMILY: Charles' mother cooks. JEN, his smoking hot 17-year-old sister, ANGRILY sets the table where his father pays bills. Pale 15-year-old sister PEG does a PUZZLE. Twin 9- YEAR-OLD BOYS bicker over an action figure. TV in the living room plays a MATCH GAME. Joe and Charles enter. \nJEN Mom, it's not fair that I can't go to Wendy's. Every single person is going except me! \nCHARLES' MOTHER Then every single person can tell you how it was -- \nCHARLES Martin, I have a new line for you. \nHe gets up to reveal Joe putting make-up on Alice. He walks over to Martin, Cary and Preston. Charles and Martin AD LIB. \nTIGHT ON JOE'S TACKLE BOX, which opens. Inside is an assortment of MAKE-UPS, sponges, cotton balls, brushes, derma wax, spirit gum, and a large jar of FAKE BLOOD. Joe is preparing to make up Alice, who sits in front of him, watching carefully as Joe prepares BASE MAKE-UP on a sponge. He looks to her. A beat. \nJOE You mind? \nAlice shakes her head: nope. Joe starts stippling the make-up onto her face. He is now, via sponge, touching the face of a girl he's admired for some time. After a beat: \nALICE My dad works at the mill. \nAnd she looks at him. Almost as if she were looking for something. Joe stops stippling. The tension is almost too much for him to bear. \nJOE Close you eyes. Please. \nHe indicates the sponge: it's for the make-up. She does. Joe starts applying the make-up to her eyelids. There's something provocative for Joe, being so close to Alice, with her eyes closed. Then, PRE-LAP: \nCHARLES (O.S.) So this is very emotional. \nEXT. TRAIN DEPOT - PLATFORM - NIGHT \nThe lights (plugged into the car cigarette lighter) and camera (a EUMIG) are set. Alice has been made up, wears a coat with purse. Martin, in his tie, faces her. They both look over their script pages as Charles adjusts the camera. \nJoe, observing, holds the boom mike (a condenser mike taped to a broom handle), Preston wears an overcoat. \nCHARLES Alice: Mrs. Hathaway really doesn't want her husband to keep investiga-- \nALICE I know, we read it, we get it. \nCHARLES Okay, I'm just directing. Martin get on your mark. Martin, you're going to have to reassure her. Do you know what \"reassure her\" means? \nMARTIN Yeah, I think so. \nCHARLES Okay-- we're starting on Alice's side first-- Preston: a couple seconds after \"action\" walk to the pay phone, make it look like this place is busy-- \nPRESTON I know what that looks like. \nPOP! Everyone JUMPS -- Charles turns -- Cary, laughing, has just exploded a firecracker: \nCHARLES Asshole, could you stop blowing shit up for two seconds and deal with the camera? \nCARY Sorry man. \nCHARLES Let's rehearse this -- save your real performances for when we're filming, though. \nMartin and Alice put away their pages -- Cary gets behind the camera. Charles stands near the camera, kneeling to camera- height. Joe wears headphones and holds the boom over the actors' heads. Preston holds a suitcase, ready to walk. \nCHARLES (CONT'D) Ready? Here we go... action! \nMartin and Alice now perform as their characters, DETECTIVE JOHN HATHAWAY and MRS. REBECCA HATHAWAY: \nDETECTIVE HATHAWAY I'm going to stay here and investigate. I think it would be safer if you leave town. \nMRS. HATHAWAY John. I don't like it. This case. These murders. \nDETECTIVE HATHAWAY What am I supposed to do, go to Michigan with you? \nPreston walks past them, acting in the background. \nMRS. HATHAWAY Mackinac Island's beautiful this time of year. \nWe're TIGHT ON JOE NOW, watching Alice. Slowly amazed at the unexpected depth and truth she brings to this role -- \nDETECTIVE HATHAWAY Sweetheart. This is my job. \nMRS. HATHAWAY The dead, coming back to life...? I think you're in danger-- \nDETECTIVE HATHAWAY I have no choice-- \nMRS. HATHAWAY You do have a choice. We all do... \nAnd holy shit, Alice actually starts to cry as she performs her lines. Not overdone, not hammy. Just fucking real. \nMRS. HATHAWAY (CONT'D) John, I've never asked you to stop. I've never asked you to give up or walk away. \nCharles watches -- in awe -- he's suddenly, giddily transported. But it's JOE who, as he stares, becomes galvanized; any vague interest in Alice has just set: \nMRS. HATHAWAY (CONT'D) But I'm asking you now-- please. For me. Don't go back. Don't leave me. (MORE) MRS. HATHAWAY (CONT'D) I need to know this isn't the last time I'll see you. (BEAT) I just love you so much. \nMartin is thrown by the passion and heart of her performance. \nIn the DUST, JOE lies frightened on the ground, eyes tightly shut. His mind races, his heart pounds -- and then: A LOUD METAL BANG! Joe stands up fast, faces a MOUNTAIN of twisted STEEL -- UPSIDE-DOWN TRAIN CARS PILED FRIGHTENINGLY around him. Just another few feet and he would've been crushed. But what was that sound? Something metal? Then again: SLAM! Joe BACKS UP, afraid -- it was almost a LABORED GROAN -- MECHANICAL or ANIMAL?! A crazy SCREECH, another BANG, then AGAIN and AGAIN!!! \nWe see Joe TIGHTLY GRIPPING HIS NECKLACE LOCKET IN HIS HAND -- THEN: CRASH! -- AWFUL-LOUD -- and a TWISTED TEN-FOOT SQUARE SHEET OF METAL EXPLODES FROM BEHIND THE OVERTURNED TRAIN CARS -- Joe covers his head as the metal STABS THE GROUND, twenty feet away: a TRAIN SLIDING DOOR. Joe turns to see it -- stunned -- then back to the direction of the NOISE -- but it is GONE. Nothing. \nTIGHT ON CHARLES' CAMERA -- on its side, FINISHING UP A CARTRIDGE OF FILM. \nJOE (O.S.) Guys?! \nJoe finds MARTIN, on his knees, THROWING UP -- Martin keeps throwing up, but pumps a THUMBS UP. \nJOE (CONT'D) Martin, are you okay?! Preston, is that you? \nPRESTON I'm okay! Though I think I'm having a heart attack! And I have a scrape! \nJoe MOVES FORWARD -- up to camera -- behind him, Cary appears, smiling. This kid enjoyed the crash: \nCARY Guys, did you see those explosions? That was awesome. \nJOE Has anyone seen Alice?! \nCHARLES (O.S.) I'm alive! Is anyone dead? \nThrough the debris, steel and dust. Joe moves forward -- Charles, shaken, eyes wide, appears through the thick dust -- \nJoe moves forward, looking at, under a train WHEEL ASSEMBLY... BLOOD. A PUDDLE OF BLOOD and Joe's heart sinks as he moves toward it -- another woman he loves, crushed?! Charles and Preston and Cary see the blood -- \nCHARLES (CONT'D) PRESTON -- oh God-- -- no -- nonono... \nMartin, still sick, calls out: \nMARTIN CARY -- what? Guys, what is it? ... shit... \nJoe moves closer to the blood -- heartsick -- on the verge of DEEP, REAL TEARS -- everything stops -- but then: \nALICE (O.S.) -- what's all that blood? \nJoe WHIPS AROUND -- standing in the dusty mess is ALICE -- shaken, but absolutely alive. Joe just BEAMS. \nALICE (CONT'D) What's the blood? -- did someone get hurt--? \nBut JOE SUDDENLY KNOWS -- he moves to the blood -- reaches below the wheels -- the others watch, freaked out -- \nKIDS (AD LIB) Joe, wait -- maybe you shouldn't touch -- what are you-- careful! \nJoe pulls out his CRUSHED MAKE-UP KIT. He brightens: \nJOE It's my fake blood. It's fake! \nCHARLES What is this stuff? \nALICE NOTICES THAT HE'S HOLDING THE NECKLACE. Joe notices this and POCKETS IT self-consciously. PRESTON calls out: \nPRESTON Guys, what are these things? \nJoe looks -- they all move to Preston (except Cary, who heads off): CRATES have spilled from a nearby split car; many shattered, revealing THOUSANDS OF SMALL WHITE-METAL CUBES which now litter the ground. Joe kneels, picks one up: \nMARTIN Hey, don't touch it, what are you doing? \nCHARLES They look like white Rubik's cubes or something. They're heavy like metal or something. There's like a billion of them. \nIt's just a few inches per side, an UNUSUAL DESIGN. Behind them, having walked up the ANGLED SIDES of overturned train cars, Cary calls out: \nCARY Guys, get up here. You can see everything from up here. \nThey move up the mass of metal, revealing a VAST VIEW OF THE WRECK. It seems to stretch on forever. It is SOBERING. \nCHARLES CARY Oh my God. ... Look at that... \nPRESTON According to my Uncle Seth, an accident like this is exceptionally rare. \nJOE It wasn't an accident. (turns away, eyes on the FIELD) There was a truck. On the tracks. \nCHARLES What? Driving on the tracks? \nJoe's seen it. He points. Chilled. \nJOE There. \nThrown fifty yards from the main wreckage is THE PICK-UP TRUCK. SHEARED IN HALF UPON IMPACT and lying in the overgrown grass. \nMARTIN How can a pick-up truck derail a train? That's impossible. \nAlice hurries past, hunting for her keys in that big purse -- she eyes the FLASHLIGHT MEN getting closer: \nALICE MOVE YOUR ASS, WE GOTTA GO!!! \nJoe grabs his make-up kit -- another duffel -- runs for the car, past a whining Charles. \nJOE GET IN THE CAR!!! \nAs the FLASHLIGHT MEN APPROACH, Joe runs and gets in the front seat, the other boys in back -- Alice SLAMS the car into REVERSE, SCREECH-BACKS UP, narrowly avoids debris, then RIDES OFF -- the FLASHLIGHT MEN arrive -- SOLDIERS -- their adrenaline pumping. One man who WALKS UP TO THE CAMERA, eyeing the vanishing car with intense suspicion: COLONEL NELEC. He then looks to the ground in front of him. \nCLOSE ON A FRESH, EMPTY YELLOW SUPER 8 FILM BOX. Nelec steps to it, picks it up. Looks at it. Then back up at the disappearing car. We PUSH IN ON HIS BURNING EYES AND -- \nEXT. OHIO ROAD - NIGHT \nRRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOAAAAAARRRRRRRR! The Buick speeds past. \nINT. BUICK - NIGHT \nOverlapping mayhem, but Charles obsesses over his camera: \nCHARLES PRESTON Holy shit, that was insane! He had a gun! An actual physical gun! \nCARY CHARLES I can't believe all that just happened here! Nothing ever My whole camera lends is like happens here!!! shattered now! \nPRESTON My heart is pounding! That train could of killed us. \nJOE (TO ALICE) Are you okay? \nAs Alice nervously drives, she shakes her head: no. \nCHARLES Oh shit, all the glass just fell out! \nMARTIN I HAVE NEVER HAD A TEACHER AIM A GUN AT ME! \nALICE It's hard enough to drive without everyone yelling! \nJOE Guys, keep it down! \nCARY JOE Joe: what was Woodward talking about? I don't know, I don't know-- \nMARTIN I'm never taking a train again. \nPRESTON \"You'll die, your parents will die,\" guys, that is not good information. \nCHARLES Great, the focus ring just fell off! \nCARY No one cares about your CAMERA! \nMARTIN Am I the only one shaking?! I'm also crying -- \nALICE We can't tell anyone we were there - - we can't say a thing about it -- my dad cannot find out I took his car, do you guys hear me?! \nJOE It's okay-- no one's saying anything. None of us. (to his friends) Guys -- we're not gonna say anything -- are we?! \nThe boys all muster, \"no's.\" Joe turns sweetly to Alice. \nJOE (CONT'D) See? No one's gonna know. \nAlice nods; if not quite relieved, at least grateful for Joe. But they all stare off for a long beat... haunted. \nEXT. ROAD - NIGHT \nThe Buick SPEEDS AWAY... \nEXT. JOE'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nCRANE DOWN as the Buick pulls up. The dusty boys pile out. They all kind of look at each other. What a night. Charles, who looks at Joe for a beat, holds up his defunct camera on the tripod. Joe nods. \nAlice finds something on the passenger seat and holds it out. \nALICE Joe, this is yours. \nJoe goes to the window. Alice holds it out: THE CUBE. He takes it with: \nJOE -- oh, thanks, \nALICE I should never have done this. \nShe just drives away. Left there are Joe, Charles, Preston, Cary and Martin. They all kind of look at Alice go. \nINT. JOE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT \nALICE ... what do you think happened...? \nJoe stops reloading the gun, looks out, gets lost as well. \nJOE You mean why he crashed the train? \nALICE I just got a horrible feeling. \nMartin has arrives there too. Preston too: \nMARTIN Anyone else still shaking from the crash? \nPRESTON I got in my parents' bed last night. Haven't done that since I was eleven. \nJoe suddenly WALKS AWAY FROM THEM, back toward the camera. \nPRESTON (CONT'D) ... did I just insult him? \nJoe grabs the camera, near Charles: \nCHARLES -- dude, what are you doing? \nJoe moves the camera back to Alice -- he looks through the lens -- uses the ZOOM -- and WE SEE JOE'S POV -- the CRASH, ZOOMED IN -- he PANS from ONE CAR TO ANOTHER. \nAlice watches Joe, who peers into the camera for a long beat, finally standing up, looking out at the crash: \nJOE That whole thing's an Air Force train. \nALICE -- what? \nINT. DINER - DAY \nThe kids sit at a table at the window. The CAR LOT is across the street. They're talking excitedly but quietly: \nJOE I make models-- plastic ones-- you know, glue `em, paint `em-- \nPRESTON And he's not embarrassed by that. \nCARY Looks who's talking, Math Camp. \nA WAITRESS is there, delivering more FOOD -- \nCHARLES Thanks, could I have a coffee, please? Cream on the side? \nWAITRESS (really?) Sure. \nShe heads off. Cary smiles at Alice. \nCARY He is so sophisticated. \nCHARLES CARY Shut up, I like coffee. No one likes coffee. \nALICE Keep going. \nJOE Air Force trains -- even models -- have these hooks... \nPRESTON Ooo! Ooo ooo ooo! They do -- for when their train cars are put on transport ships. \nJOE Every car in that crash had hooks, every one... \nCHARLES Joe: stop talking about it. \nMARTIN Am I the only one who doesn't understand what this all means? \nCARY Probably, Smartin. \nMARTIN Shut up, I don't like that-- \nJOE PRESTON Dr. Woodward had that map. He drove onto the tracks. Maybe there was something-- -- he wanted to destroy, he wanted to destroy? yeah. \nCHARLES Please shut up, all of you. \nCARY I say he was just sick of being old and wanted to kill himself. \nJOE He had a gun, why not use that? \nPRESTON There are infinitely more effective ways to commit suicide: pills, HANGING-- \nCARY CHARLES Pussy, stop pulling the fries away. I ordered these for a reason. -- he gets all possessive with his fries, it's so annoying. \nPRESTON (CONT'D) You could jump from a building. \nBreen doesn't respond. The sheriff throws a candy bar at him. \nSHERIFF PRUITT (CONT'D) Breen. \nBreen pulls off the headphones. \nBREEN Hey, Sheriff. \nSHERIFF PRUITT What's that? \nBREEN Walkman. It's like a stereo, play your own cassette tapes. (OFFERS HEADPHONES) You wanna try it? \nSHERIFF PRUITT (pays for the candy bars) I don't think so. Kids walking around with their own stereos. Just what we need. It's a slippery slope. \nHe exits the store. \nBREEN ... yessir. \nPruitt heads out; Breen puts the headphones on again. \nEXT. KELVIN GAS STATION - NIGHT \nWe see we're at the lonely gas station the kids drove past earlier. Pruitt's SQUAD CAR filling up, the only car here. High overhead, a yellow KELVIN sign TURNS atop a tall pole near the road. Pruitt crosses to his car. Peels the candy bar. Hearing something, he turns -- a PACK OF DOGS RUN BY. A DISTANT SHOT AS THE LIGHTS ALL MOMENTARILY DIM AND FLICKER. CLOSE UP of the PUMP'S SPINNING white NUMBER on black; the gallons and dollar amount blurring higher -- then A BIZARRE REFLECTION -- Pruitt sees it, turns -- and what he sees is TALL AND TERRIFYING -- he DROPS THE CANDY -- GOES FOR HIS GUN, BUT -- \nINT. KELVIN GAS STATION - NIGHT \nBreen, eyes closed, blasts his Walkman (we only hear TINNY MUSIC) as, through the window behind him, the rear of the squad car SUDDENLY SPRINGS UPWARD VIOLENTLY as if the FRONT SECTION WAS SUDDENLY CRUSHED! PRUITT SCREAMS, MUFFLED, as the CAR SLAMS back to the pavement -- LIGHTS FLICKER -- \nEXT. KELVIN GAS STATION - NIGHT \nGas PUMPING onto the asphalt, SCREAMS OF PRUITT, horrible, CONFOUNDING -- \nINT. KELVIN GAS STATION - NIGHT \nPRUITT'S SCREAMS END as Breen OPENS HIS EYES AND RIPS off the headphones: the hell was that? He looks outside -- sees the car -- shattered windows. Confused, he heads out -- \nEXT. KELVIN GAS STATION - NIGHT \nBreen moves tentatively toward the CRUSHED CAR -- quickly glances for Pruitt, who's missing. He gets close to the car, confounded by what he sees -- hands shaking, he rights the pump and replaces it. His heart pounds as he starts for the building -- but SLIPS ON THE GAS -- falls hard -- looks up -- sees whatever's coming for him -- SCREAMS as he gets to his feet and RUNS LIKE A MOTHERFUCKER -- \nINT. KELVIN GAS STATION - NIGHT \nBreen RUSHES INSIDE -- we're WITH HIM as behind him: KKKRASH!!!! An EXPLOSION OF GLASS AND JUNK FOOD and -- \nEXT. KELVIN GAS STATION - NIGHT \nWE LOOK DOWN UPON THE STATION FROM UP HIGH -- where the turning, lit KELVIN SIGN BLOCKS OUR VIEW FOR THE MOMENT -- we can only HEAR THE HORROR happening inside the station until FINALLY the sign REVEALS THE STATION -- everything inside looks like it's in a BLENDER -- THERE'S A SUPER-HUMAN UPHEAVAL HAPPENING IN THERE -- and Breen's SCREAMS CONTINUE as the turning Kelvin sign BLOCKS OUR VIEW AGAIN -- as the SOUND GETS UNBEARABLE, A SUDDEN CUT TO: \nA FACE. A MAKE-UP BRUSH APPLYING MAKE-UP. It's ALICE, and she's becoming a ZOMBIE. We are: \nINT. CHARLES' KITCHEN - DAY \nJoe makes her up -- a not half-bad, simple ZOMBIE MAKE-UP. Pale skin, sunken eyes and cheekbones. In the background, the other kids prepare to film. \nHe hands her a mirror, she gazes into it, sort of amazed. \nALICE Where'd you learn how to do this? \nJOE Mostly the Dick Smith Monster Make- up Handbook. \nShe nods. Whatever. Charles is suddenly there, with Cary: \nCHARLES Hey! So I'm gonna need more shots of the train crash, obviously-- you know that train model you made? Can we blow it up and film it? \nJoe doesn't want to do this at all. AT ALL. But... \nJOE ... sure. \nCHARLES CARY Mint. Gnarly! \nCharles and Cary head off, planning the explosions. Alice looks at him knowingly. \nJOE (CONT'D) I don't care, they can blow it up. I can show you the train, it's nothing, it's stupid. (BEAT) (MORE) JOE (CONT'D) You wanna see it? Later? The... train? My train model? The train I made? \nThe LIGHTS IN THE HOUSE DIM -- BROWN OUT -- then back on. \nCHARLES MARTIN That's like the third time Dude. Bitchen. that's happened. \nALICE So how am I supposed to be a zombie? \nJOE Oh. Just be a lifeless ghoul. Someone with no soul, dead eyes. Scary. D'you ever have Mrs. Mullin? \nThen we see the REVERSE -- SLOWLY PULLING BACK -- REVEALING THAT THERE ARE DOZENS AND DOZENS OF BRAND NEW \"DOG MISSING\" SIGNS POSTED ON THE BOARD. It's COVERED in them. Joe is so stunned, he doesn't notice the MILITARY TRUCKS that pass in the background behind him. \nINT. JOE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT \nKA-BAM: back door opens, Joe enters. EMPTY PIZZA BOX on the table. Jack and four POLICE OFFICERS in the living room, smoking, reviewing POLICE REPORTS, marking MAPS, taking notes -- WORKING ON THE PROBLEMS THEY'RE HAVING -- \nOFFICER MIKE We need more help around here. \nOFFICER GORDON We've got four men on the Pruitt case alone. We've called into Dayton, they'll be out in the MORNING---- \nJACK That's not enough. People don't feel safe here -- and you know why? `Cause they're not-- \nThe officers agree. Joe moves into the doorway where his dad and other convene. \nJACK (CONT'D) -- the Air Force isn't answering a damn question: they've got trucks at Woodward's house, looking for SOMETHING -- \nOFFICER They've got trucks all over town. \nOFFICER JAY I saw a guy riding shotgun in one of those trucks -- had some kind of scanner in his hand -- \nDEPUTY TALLY --like a Geiger counter or SOMETHING-- \nJACK I know. They're saying it's just clean-up at the train crash, but they're taking molds of tire tracks. Which means they're looking for someone-- now what's that about? \nJoe has heard this and DROPPED HIS FLASHLIGHT -- the men all turn, silent. Joe, on the spot: \nJOE -- have you... seen Lucy? \nJACK I'm sure she's around. I put a couple of slices in the fridge for you there. \nDEPUTY TALLY -- oh-- I ate those. Sorry, Kid-- \nJOE That's... okay, I'll find a-- \nThen the POWER GOES OUT -- the men react -- it FLICKERS ON AND OFF -- Jack grabs his radio a the POWER RETURNS: \nJACK Vicky, you got power at the station? \nDISPATCH (V.O.) On and off. Brook County's in the dark. \nJACK Get water and power out there now. \nINT. JOE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nJoe paints his model on the floor of his living room, watching In Search Of and talking to Charles on his walkie talkie. \nJOE So the Air Force is looking for a car -- Alice's dad's car -- they're taking tire prints from the crash site. Over. \nCHARLES I don't wanna hear about it. They could be monitoring us right now! Jesus, shut up. Over! \nJOE (VERY CONCERNED) And the military's at Woodward's house. Looking for his research. Whatever that means? \nCHARLES Joe -- YOU CAN NOT FLAKE OUT ON ME AND BE A DICK! Are you gonna come help me tomorrow or not? I need you to make Alice a zombie again. \nAnd Joe tries to snap himself out of it. But is disturbed. \nJOE Okay... I'll do the make-up. Over. \nEXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT \nWIDE SHOT: middle of nowhere wooded area as an OHIO POWER CHERRY PICKER TRUCK drives up, parks beside a UTILITY POLE. \nINT. DWP CHERRY PICKER - NIGHT \nROONEY, 49. Cigarette in his mouth, makes notes on a weathered clipboard. Glances at the power line. Doesn't understand what he sees -- PUSH IN ON HIM. He radios in: \nROONEY This is Rooney at Mary-10, was there re-routing on this line? \nVOICE (V.O.) Negative, but the grid through Liberty is dark. \nROONEY ... yeah, `cause there's no overhead lines on these poles. \nVOICE (V.O.) -- come again? \nROONEY No power, no comm cables. Stand by. \nHe DRIVES AGAIN -- we see a WIDE SHOT OF THE LANDSCAPE -- HALF A DOZEN UTILITY POLES -- ALL BARE -- NOT ONE WIRE. \nEXT. SALVAGE YARD ROAD - NIGHT \nThe truck comes to a stop, roadside. Tall trees and a SALVAGE YARD behind them. PUSH IN ON ROONEY who calls in: \nROSKO No. What? \nJACK Hey Danny, you have a radio scanner with a descrambler don't you? \nDANNY Voice inverter, yeah. \nJACK Whatever, get it down and set it up for me. \nROSKO What is this? \nJACK I think the Air Force is using UNASSIGNED CHANNELS-- \nHe heads for his office, seeing LOUIS, who is being escorted out by an Officer across the room. \nLOUIS Hey -- he was at my house yesterday morning, are you aware of that? \nOFFICER ROSKO (quiet to Jack) We brought him in about the car lot and other things -- he's clean. \nLOUIS I'd appreciate it if you would inform your son that my house if off-limits. And so it my daughter. \nLouis heads out -- HOLD ON JACK AS he turns, ENTERS HIS OFFICE, and as that door opens, we CUT TO: \nINT. JOE'S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON \nThe door opens of his messy, motherless room. Joe and Alice enter. He could not be more self-conscious. He moves stacks of comic, tosses some dirty clothes behind the bed -- pair of underwear and socks. He closes the closet and hangs a bath towel on his desk chair. She looks around sa she enters. The light dim, intimate. \nJOE Oh gawd, I didn't clean up. \nJoe quickly moves a pile of papers and books from the desk to the floor; NOTEBOOKS AND SCHOOL WORK spill out and we get a GLIMPSE of some \"B-MINUSES\" and other \"C-PLUSES\" in RED. \nJoe, embarrassed, hides them, then moves to his MODELS: \nALICE -- you made all these? \nJOE Yeah, that's the Hunchback of Notre Dame. I watched that one on TV. HERE--- \nAlice sits on the bed. Joe takes the FIVE-CAR TRAIN MODEL. She moves close: \nJOE (CONT'D) This is the train they wanna destroy. \nAlice hold it. Joe watches her. She really looks at it. \nALICE ... it looks real. (beat, studies) It looks so old... \nJOE That's dry brush technique. (off her look) After you've painted the base color, you take something like... (grabs up Testors bottle) Euro Gray. \nHer face is so close to his. Her hair touches his ear. \nALICE Euro Gray... \nJOE There are so many different grays, it's crazy. And you pour a little onto like a paper plate. Then you take a dry brush and you just dip it in, then you brush on the paper, so the paint's barely on the brush. Then you make small brush strokes on the model. Little ones, like where the wear and tear would be. Around the wheels. Or where the doors would slide. Then you do it again, like with Camouflage Gray-- or here, I used Insignia Red to make it look like there was another coat of paint on there before. Like they painted over it, but you could see it scratched off. \nLost in thought, he looks at her. Suddenly self-conscious. \nALICE What was that necklace? (off his awkward stare) The one you were holding at the train crash. Was it your mom's? \nIt takes him a beat. Finally: \nJOE My dad gave it to her the day I was born. She wears it all the time. Used to. (BEAT) It was bad, how she-- died and stuff, but they got the necklace back. So. \nTheir tension INTERRUPTED BY an out of breath Charles: \nCHARLES Guys, what the hell?! No one knew where you were. \nJOE We're sitting right here. \nCHARLES You gotta be the soldier. \nJOE I thought you were calling Evan. \nCHARLES Evan blew us off, he's a pussy. (TO ALICE) Excuse me. \nALICE It's okay. \nCHARLES You gotta do it. You're the only one. \nINT. POLICE STATION - JACK'S OFFICE - DAY \nJack with OFFICER TALLY (24): \nJACK The hell do you mean you \"found my dog in Brookville?\" That's a DIFFERENT COUNTY-- \nOVERMYER Sixty boxes in the basement, maybe more. \nNELEC What, more tax returns? \nOVERMYER It's here somewhere. If we can't find it, Woodward'll tell us where it is. \nBut Nelec has seen something outside: THE KIDS. \nNELEC ... the hell's that? \nOVERMYER ... looks like kids making a movie... \nBehind them, a WINDOW, showing the street, where Jack insists Joe get into the car. Nelec looks out -- sees Jack take Joe by the arm, grab the tripod and head to his squad car. \nEXT. WOORWARD'S HOUSE - DAY \nAs Jack gets out, he sees the kids and isn't happy. He moves toward Joe and his friends: \nCHARLES Joe. (TO JACK) Hey, Mr. Lamb! \nJoe spins around as Jack arrives, grabs his camera from Charles and saying firmly, to Joe: \nJACK Get in the car. \nJoe is stunned -- instantly humiliated in front of Alice -- he's taken back to the squad car -- \nCHARLES Uh-- Mr. Lamb? That's your camera, but technically, that's my film-- \nJack OPENS the car's back door -- Joe gets in -- Jack SLAMS it shut, then throws the camera and tripod into the passenger seat and SLAMS that door, heading to the house, leaving Joe in the back. Nelec heads outside -- Jack moves to him: \nNELEC I would like to help you out deputy. I really would. But we operate on a need to know basis. \nJACK Why are your trucks sweeping the town? \nNELEC We'll be out of your way shortly. \nJACK Then I'm sure you wouldn't mind me contacting DC. Talk to some friends about \"Walking Distance.\" \nThis lands on Nelec. \nJACK (CONT'D) All right. We'll do it that way. \nJack heads off. \nNELEC Deputy. (JACK TURNS) Let's talk. Just not here. \nJack stops, turns to uncomfortable Nelec. \nINT. SQUAD CAR - DAY \nJoe, his breathing heavying, sits in the car, heart pounding, watching his father move over to talk to Nelec, close again. Then he looks over at his friends -- Charles giving him a \"WHAT THE FUCK?!\" Look. Alice watches him sympathetically. She mouths to him a guilty, \"...is it me...?\" And Joe shakes his head: \"No.\" But we -- and she -- know better. \nEXT. JOE'S HOUSE - DAY \nThe squad car pulls up. Jack gets out, Joe follows -- THE CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL THAT WE ARE: \nINT. JOE'S HOUSE - DAY \nDoor opens. Jack enters, then lets Joe pass him. Joe closes the door hard and says, angrily, but restrained: \nJACK This is new. All this. For the both of us. Dealing with-- all this, just us. So I'm going to make this as clear and simple as I can: You're not friends with Alice Dainard. When I say no, I don't mean maybe. I don't mean yes. I mean no. I've known Louis Dainard for alotta years-- he's been nothing but trouble. Your mother used to say he's not a bad guy, he just needs a chance, he's just sad - - well I tried to be good to him, but I can't. Not anymore. I will not allow him or his daughter in this house. I will not allow you spending time with her, doing projects or whatever it is that you're doing. THAT'S IT. I hope we're clear. \nJack turns to leave -- but Joe, enraged, says: \nJOE We're not clear. \nJack stops -- stunned -- Joe's heart pounds -- \nJACK What'd you say? \nJOE We're not clear. You and I aren't clear about anything. We couldn't be less clear. \nJACK Joseph Francis Lamb-- \nJOE (ERUPTING) Just `cause mom died doesn't mean you know anything about me!!! You don't. You don't know about Alice either -- she's kind! \nJACK I'm not having this discussion with you--! \nJOE She's NICE to me! \nJACK I don't care what she is! Her father is a selfish, irresponsible son-of-a-bitch! \nJOE -- no, I totally do, I'm just... sort of in shock at this whole CONVERSATION-- \nAnd the POWER RETURNS -- Joe's CLOCK LIGHT goes on behind him -- but more chilling, the PROJECTOR comes back on; the SILENT HOME MOVIE OF HIS MOTHER PLAYS. Joe crawls to the projector to stop it -- but: \nALICE -- no, keep it-- please -- \nAlice moves closer to the screen. Joe sits behind her. She watches the film. Can't take her eyes away. \nALICE (CONT'D) ... is that her? \nJOE ... yeah... \nAnd as Alice watches, we GENTLY PUSH IN... as tears start to fill her eyes. Behind her, at a near WHISPER: \nJOE (CONT'D) ... it's so weird watching her like this, like she's still here... (beat, lost in it) ... she used to look at me, this way... like really look. And I just... knew I was there. That I existed. \nA tear drops down Alice's face, though Joe can't see that. Finally, quietly: \nALICE He drank that morning. My dad. (BEAT) He missed his shift. (beat, hard) Your mom took it for him. The day of the accident. \nWatching his mother, Joe is quietly stunned. Finally, eyes wet, Alice turns to Joe. \nALICE (CONT'D) ... I know he wishes it was him. Instead of her. (HARD BEAT) ... and sometimes I wish it was, too. \nJoe just stares at her... heartsick and speechless. Finally: \nJOE Don't say that. (BEAT) He's your dad. \nJust then, the SUPER 8 movie ENDS: the film FLIPFLIPFLIPS. Joe turns off the projector -- but a SOUND REMAINS. A sort of SHUDDER-HUM. Joe unplugs the projector, but the sound remains. Then they look: THE SHUDDERING IS COMING FROM THE CUBE HE TOOK FROM THE CRASH SITE, sitting on his desk. \nJoe and Alice move to it. He turns on his desk lamp. The cube VIBRATES, almost imperceptibly. \nALICE JOE -- has this--? -- no. \nJoe opens a drawer, grabs a paintbrush -- he touches the cube -- the thing SHUDDERS ON ITS OWN. \nThey are amazed. They get LOW -- eyes at desk level -- the SHUDDERING INCREASES IN PITCH AND VOLUME -- he reaches out to touch it with his finger, but suddenly the cube BULLETS AWAY - - ACROSS THE ROOM -- AND BLASTS THROUGH THE WALL, LEAVING A FIVE-INCH HOLE IN THE WALL! She screams -- they both fall to the floor, STUNNED -- PUSH IN ON Joe, his heart pounding. He moves to the wall -- looks through the hole: in the distance, trees and the TOWN WATER TOWER. \nINT. ALICE'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nAlice enters the dark house quietly. She steps carefully toward her room, when -- \nLOUIS (O.S.) Morning. \nHis voice makes her JUMP. She turns: sitting in the dark, in an armchair, is her father. He's awake. And drunk. \nLOUIS (CONT'D) You wanna tell me where you were? Or you want me to tell you. \nA tense beat, her mind races. Breathe, Alice, just breathe. \nLOUIS (CONT'D) Sit down. \nALICE I should go to bed. \nLOUIS I wanna talk to you. I said sit down. \nALICE I don't want to sit down. \nLOUIS Then go. Be just like your mother and leave. \nThis kills her -- but she does: she leaves the house. \nLOUIS (CONT'D) GO AHEAD, GO! \nEXT. ALICE'S HOUSE - PRE-DAWN \nAlice, crying, gets on her bike and rides off -- a DISTANT FIERY GLOW past the factory and over the hills. The front door opens -- Louis comes out and yells, miserable: \nLOUIS ALICE!!! WAIT!!! \nBut she's far gone -- Louis' mind races -- he runs to his BUICK -- starts it up -- PULLS OUT FAST and goes after her -- \nEXT. LILLIAN STREET - PRE-DAWN \nAlice PEDALS HARD, she wants to escape everywhere. No cars on the street, no people. A block behind her, SCREECH: a CAR turns onto the road. Her father's car -- she makes a turn -- \nINT. BUICK - PRE-DAWN \nWe're with Louis as he drive -- clearly drunk -- \nEXT. SHARP TURN ROAD - PRE-DAWN \nJOE Why? \nCHARLES There's nothing wrong-- \nAs we CONTINUE BOOMING UP, we arrive at the top of the WATER TOWER, where THE CUBE HAS AFFIXED ITSELF TO THE SIDE -- unseen from the street. In the distance, THE THREATENING FIRE SMOKE LOOMS -- \nEXT. CHARLES' HOUSE - DAY \nAs Joe and Charles ride their bikes up to his house: \nJOE I'll get the camera back, I know where my dad put it -- We can still make the festival. \nCHARLES It's not about the movie. \nJOE Then what is it about? \nCHARLES Jesus, you don't even get it do you? It's obvious. \nJOE What's obvious? \nCHARLES Gawd, you're a dumb ass. \nFrustrated beyond belief, Charles goes inside. Joe follows. \nINT. CHARLES' ROOM - DAY \nCharles threads the film into the projector. \nCHARLES That night of the crash, you started getting all weird. \nJOE -- what? \nCHARLES Like Mr. Attitude all of a sudden. \nJOE Your movie was over! That's what you said! You were upset. I gave you a camera! I helped you! \nCHARLES Don't pretend like you did it for me! You didn't do it for me and you know it! \nJOE What's your problem? \nCharles ROLLS THE FILM, DIMS THE LIGHTS -- \nCHARLES It was never about me! It was always about Alice! \nAnd suddenly on the poster board pinned to the closet, there she is: ALICE, from the night of the train crash. The scene plays as they filmed it: \nMRS. HATHAWAY John. I don't like it. This case. These murders. \nDETECTIVE HATHAWAY What am I supposed to do, go to Michigan with you? \nTHE FILMED SCENE CONTINUES as Joe and Charles argue: \nJOE Well, you're the one who wanted the wife in the movie! \nCHARLES Not so you could fall in love with her! \nJoe's mind spins -- how does he respond to this?! \nJOE What do you even care what I think about Alice?! \nCHARLES Because I like her! That's why! That's why I asked her in the first place! So I could get to know her, not YOU! \nJOE -- wait, you like Alice Dainard? \nCHARLES You're such an idiot. \nJOE (from Charles' movie) Guys, look out! \nThey watch for a moment as the TRAIN CRASH HAPPENS -- but it's SO SUDDEN, SO FAST, the camera picks up almost nothing. Within a moment, the camera is on its side, filming the SETTLING DEBRIS. Charles moves forward, so the film is now partially BEING PROJECTED ON HIM. \nCHARLES SHIT! Look at all that smoke! We can't use any of this. And you won't even let me blow up your train. Everything's bogus. \nJOE We can make another train and blow that one up. \nJoe moves forward. Part of the film PROJECTED ON HIM, too. \nJOE (CONT'D) I do like her. Sorry about that. \nCJAR Shut up. It's okay. (BEAT) That's not even what bothers me. (beat, finally, sad) It's that she likes you too. That really bothers me. I dunno... \nBut Joe has seen something -- on the screen -- SOTTO: \nLOUIS It took her. I saw it. It was... something... so... big, like nothing -- it was-- and no one... no one believes me... (CRYING) ... no one believes me-- they just keep giving me pills. It took her... Joe, it took Alice... no one believes me. \nJoe's mind is on fire as he absorbs this -- HE WHISPERS: \nJOE ... I believe you. \nAnd Louis looks at him with hope -- \nJOE (V.O.) (CONT'D) It took Alice. \nCUT TO JOE WITH HIS FRIENDS, assembled around a set of cots. \nCHARLES CARY That thing took her--?! -- are you shitting me? \nJOE (CONT'D) Guys, WE HAVE TO GO BACK. \nThey look at him like he's from Uranus. \nCHARLES PRESTON Back where? To do what? \nJOE (CONT'D) Back to town -- to find Alice -- we have to find her-- \nMARTIN JOE She's dead, if it took her, she-- -- don't say that! \nPRESTON Wait a minute -- first of all, I want to live. Okay? \nJOE I'm going whether you come or not-- which I really hope you do. \nCARY (pats his backpack) I've got six tons of explosives in here, let's find that thing and blow it to shit. \nINT. GREENVILLE AIR FORCE BASE HANGAR - DAY \nJen, Charles' hot sister, lies on her cot making her Columbia House Records choices. Charles is in her face. \nJEN As if I'm gonna help you. \nCHARLES Do this for me and I'll babysit the twins next week so you can go to Wendy's stupid party. \nJen suddenly closes her magazine, stares at him suspiciously. \nCHARLES (CONT'D) I am not shitting you. You can't ask me any questions though. You can't tell anyone. I'm serious. No one. \nJEN ... does it have to be him? \nCHARLES Yes or no, you ugly freak. I'm about to rescind the offer. \nINT. GREENVILLE AIR FORCE BASE HANGAR - DAY \nJen looks RIGHT AS US, vulnerable, but seductive: \nJEN This whole evacuation thing's freaking me out. Making me rethink my priorities. Saw you over here and thought maybe we could kick back. \nNow we see Donny, looking RIGHT AT US. Utterly stunned. \nDONNY -- we totally could. \nJEN I asked Charles about you, and he said you're a great guy-- \nDONNY I totally am. \nJEN Will you hate me if I start our relationship by asking a favor? \nEXT. GREENVILLE AIR FORCE BASE HANGAR - DAY \nMOVING PAST as Donny moves through PARKED CARS, Joe, Charles, Cary and Martin keeping up: \nDONNY So there are rules to being in my car, okay? \nCARY Where the hell are we going anyway? \nJOE We're going to the school to open the trailer Woodward had in the parking lot. I bet that's where he keeps his research. \nThe boys duck as SOLDIERS pass by. \nCARY What research? \nJOE We're gonna learn everything we can about that thing so we can find it. And that's how we're gonna save Alice. \nDONNY Dorks: no shoes on the upholstery and no one touches the CB, gottit? \nCHARLES You think Woodward's got information about that thing in the dungeon? \nANGLE ON THE DRIVER as a RADIO CALL come in: \nVOICE (V.O.) (FILTERED) Base Fortress requests ETA. \nNelec arrives, grabs the radio mike: \nNEWS REPORTER Chief Master Sergeant, Dustoff-03 is twenty minutes out. \nVOICE (V.O.) Roger. \nPAN as Nelec moves back -- we PUSH IN on OVERMYER, who sits near the front, putting on his DARK GLOVES. Nelec sits, which takes us to a shot towards the back of the bus -- another Airman, HERNANDEZ, 40, sits too. PUSH PAST THEM toward our four BOYS, sitting cuffed and seat-belted behind the dirty, wired SAFETY GLASS, all looking toward us, terrified. \nCHARLES ... what... what's gonna happen? \nCARY I think we're gonna die. \nMARTIN No. They'd never do that. \nJOE -- guys-- I forced you to come with me... I'm... I'm so sorry. (looks to Charles) I'm so sorry... \nCARY I think they're gonna kill us. \nCHARLES (UNCONVINCING) Joe. They're not gonna kill us. You know why? \nJoe is suddenly hopeful: \nJOE ... why--? \nBut just as he's spoken, a SHAPE FROM THE DARKNESS BEHIND HIM SLAMS HARD INTO THE BUS, SPIDER-WEBBING THE BULLETPROOF GLASS! The ENTIRE BUS IS ROCKED, Charles SCREAMS, hurt -- \nAt the front of the bus, NELEC FALLS -- HITS A BENCH, THEN CRASHES INTO THE SIDE WINDOW -- \nEXT. ROAD - NIGHT \nThe bus was hit SO HARD it rides for a moment ONLY ON ITS RIGHT TIRES -- \nINT. TRANSPORT BUS - NIGHT \nThe MILITARY DRIVER struggles with the wheel -- \nDRIVER -- HOLD ON. HOLD ON--!!! \nCHARLES Was that the thing from the train?! \nEXT. ROAD - NIGHT \nThe bus SLAMS BACK onto the road, LOUD -- A TIRE BLOWS! We MOVE AROUND THE BUS -- JUST MISSING SEEING THE CREATURE -- \nINT. TRANSPORT BUS - NIGHT \nThe kids panic as the HOBBLED BUS STILL DRIVES -- \nCHARLES Was that it?! Oh my God!!! \nMARTIN I can't see anything -- do you see anything? \nJIE -- not yet --! \nDRIVER -- Sir, I gotta pull over! \nEXT. ROAD - NIGHT \nHIGH OVERHEAD: the bus comes to a sudden SCREECHING stop. \nINT. TRANSPORT BUS - NIGHT \nCharles looks forward -- \nCHARLES Oh my God, guys -- \nJoe turns to see NELEC LOADING A RIFLE, straining to see out a driver's side window. Mayhem: \nCHARLES (CONT'D) What's that gun --? \nCary, behind him, actually answers him: \nCARY CHARLES Sako Bolt Action, 30-06 (pronounced: thirty-aut-six) -- okay okay okay, I get it -- Leathwood Art Scope-- \nHernandez makes a radio call, Overmyer straining to see out the windows as Nelec locks and loads the unique ammo and moves to a driver's side window, tries to see -- \nHERNANDEZ OVERMYER -- repeat, contact with precious cargo, thirty clicks -- sir, I do not have visual - from center of town, - Driver, can you see currently headed for Base anything? FORTRESS -- \nNELEC This is Nelec -- use the big guns. Whatever happens to me, you take it down, you kill him -- \n-- and he drops the walkie and FIRES AGAIN -- the LOUD GUNFIRE BARELY AUDIBLE behind the glass with the boys as Joe hits the glass again -- BAM -- a CRINKLING of glass -- \nCHARLES You can do it! \nJoe hits again -- so does the creature -- as Nelec RUNS OUT OF AMMO. That was never really hope anyway. Joe hits again and CRASH! The window SHATTERS! Glass chunks RAIN DOWN on the boys -- all covering their face -- Cary seeing the CREATURE STARTING TO ENTER THE BUS -- \nCARY Go! Joe, move!!! \nWith all the boys helping, Joe pulls himself up -- outside the bus, Joe peeks out -- the fucking creature -- its back to Joe -- just fifteen feet away, focused on the door -- and Joe strains to climb out here, onto the top-side of the bus. \nAnd as the boys climb out, the creature climbs in -- first Joe, then Charles (AD LIB DIALOGUE WITH CARY AND MARTIN: \"You gotta lose some weight --\" \"I know!!!\"), Then Cary, and Martin last -- they all jump down to the dirt -- they hear SCREAMS and turn back for a moment -- \nInside the bus, Nelec watches as the creature ENTERS THE TIGHT-FITTING BUS, SMASHING BENCHES, MAKING ITS WAY TERRIFYINGLY DOWN THE AISLE TOWARD HIM. And as the creature descends upon him, in the silence before the final lunge -- Nelec says, eerily quietly, terrified: \nNELEC -- it was my turn once... to find you. Now... it's your t-- \nBefore he can finish, the creature fucking ATTACKS -- and it would be horrible and brutal, if the BLOOD DIDN'T SPRAY UPON THE BULLETPROOF GLASS -- WHICH OUR CAMERA IS SAFELY BEHIND -- OBSCURING THE NIGHTMARISH VIEW. \nIn the field, a distance away, the boys watch the bus SHUDDER and SHAKE. Then... silence. They see the creature burst out of the bus -- then RUN OFF -- fast and stealthy, away from them in the overgrown grass, like a native hunter. Which, of course, is partly what it is. They're sort of stunned. \nCHARLES I just sharteezed a little. \nINT. GREENVILLE AIR FORCE BASE HANGAR - NIGHT \nLouis stares off, lost. Two AIR FORCE SOLDIERS arrive: \nSOLDIER You need to come with us, we have some questions for you -- \nLOUIS -- what, is she... Is she dead--? \nSOLDIER TWO Just come with us. \nStanding is hard for heartsick Louis, his legs so hurt -- suddenly JACK IS THERE, acting the role of Air Force: \nJACK Hey fellas, I've got orders from Colonel Nelec to personally transport this man to base. \nSOLDIER He's all yours, Staff Sergeant. \nAs the two Soldiers head off, Jack wraps Louis' arm over his shoulders, heads off in the other direction, as Louis looks him over, confused: \nLOUIS Where're we going--? \nJACK -- to find our kids. \nOn LOUIS' FACE -- a surprised glimmer of HOPE -- \nEXT. TRANSPORT BUS - NIGHT \nMoments later, TIGHT on a POCKET -- Joe pulls out his MOTHER'S NECKLACE. WIDEN to see that he's taken the necklace from Overmyer's dead body. Cary holds up his backpack. \nCARY Got my fireworks back! \nCHARLES (who gives a shit) Congratulations! \nThey turn: a car comes, fast -- PUSH IN ON JOE who studies the oncoming car, as behind him: \nMARTIN They're coming, man! I think we should go! \nJOE No--!!! No, look! \nThe car ARRIVES: It's DONNY. He gets out of his car, wild- and red-eyed, incredibly happy to see them: \nDONNY Ho ho!!! You dorks are alive! I didn't know...! (finally sees the bus) ... what the FUCK?! \nJOE We need to get back to town! \nDONNY Hop in, man! But you should know: I am massively stoned right now. \nJOE You want me to drive? \nDonny looks at Joe, like it hurts to think. \nEXT. LILLIAN SUBURB STREET - NIGHT \nThe Catalina cruises fast through the deserted neighborhood -- \nINT. DONNY'S CAR - NIGHT \nJoe drives, Donny is ASLEEP. Other boys in the back. \nCHARLES ... you gonna be okay without me? \nJOE (a meaningful beat) ... yeah. \nCharles nods -- Joe looks to Cary: \nCARY I'm not staying with the girls! \nCHARLES God, Cary. Shut up! \nCARY Calm down. \nMARTIN Oh, my leg hurts! \nJOE Come on, Cary, we gotta go. \nJoe nods, determined, and he and Cary head off -- \nCHARLES This is going to hurt. \nMartin screams. \nCHARLES (CONT'D) I haven't even done it yet. \nJoe and Cary run through the semi-demolished neighborhood, many houses shattered, some cars obliterated. The only lone figures in town. \nEXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT \nJoe and Cary stop, out of breath, at the graves. \nCARY So what are we doing here? \nJOE Just follow me. \nCARY I've been following you for the last five blocks. What are we doing here? \nJoe and Cary run through the graveyard and over to the CARETAKER'S SHED. \nEXT./INT. CEMETERY CARETAKER'S SHED - NIGHT \nThey're out of breath -- they try ONE garage door, windows CAKED WITH DIRT. Stuck. The SECOND door. Dirt-caked windows. Stuck. The third is a barn door -- they try it: locked. \nJOE Help me! \nCARY Help you with what? \nJOE We need to get inside. \nCARY For what? What's in these windows? \nJOE Cary, help me. \nCARY It's dirt. Why is there dirt in these windows? \nJOE Help me, on three. \nJOE/CARY One, two, three.... One, two, three.... One, two threee. \nThe two begin KICKING the door together -- on three -- one -- two -- CRASH! Again and again, until finally the door KICKS OPEN -- and they almost FALL INSIDE -- and thank goodness they didn't -- because -- and now we're looking STRAIGHT DOWN FROM INSIDE THE SHED -- the entire floor of the shed has been DUG OUT -- DROPPING FORTY FEET STRAIGHT DOWN, dirt PILED, caked along the sides of the structure. The boys catch their breath. \nCARY Whoa. This is scary. \nJOE You got any sparklers in there? \nCARY Are you kidding me? \nCary opens his backpack, whips out a Fourth of July SPARKLER. LIGHTS it with a lighter and DROPS IT IN. The thing falls far enough to tell them it's too far to jump. \nBut burning on the dirt floor of the nearly-dug hole, it lights up a TUNNEL at the bottom. \nJOE -- Alice is down there. \nEXT. ROAD - NIGHT \nA JEEP roars past. \nINT. JEEP - NIGHT \nJack drives fast. Louis sits beside him. It's awkward. But not angry. Finally, vulnerable, scared and sad: \nLOUIS I came to your house that day. To tell you that I never meant to hurt anyone. Swear to God. (beat, respectful tears) I'm sorry, Jack. About what happened to your wife. \nCary's done laying out the charges -- he pulls out his lighter -- FFFT! FFFT! The damn thing won't light -- \nCARY -- come on-- damnit! \nFFT! FFT! No go -- he keeps trying. \nINT. TUNNEL #4 - NIGHT \nJoe watches as the creature FINISHES WITH ITS MEAL AND HEADS FOR THE OTHER HANGING BODIES -- PUSH IN ON JOE, DESPERATE -- \nJOE -- Cary, come on, come on-- \nINT. TUNNEL #2 - NIGHT \nCary frantically trying the lighter -- FFT! FFT! FFT! \nCARY -- damnit!!! \nHe looks up -- watches the creature GRAB AND PULL ALICE'S LIFELESS BODY DOWN FROM HER HANGING POSITION -- it moves with her to where he was eating the teacher -- Cary SHAKES THE LIGHTER, STARTING TO CRY AND HE FLICKS IT AND FFFFFTH!!! IT LIGHTS! HE TOUCHES IT ON THE GUN POWDER AND RUNS OFF -- \nINT. MECHANICAL CONTRAPTION SPACE - NIGHT \nThe creature PULLS AWAY the fibrous covering over Alice -- its TENTACLES SLITHER OUT. \nINT. TUNNEL #4 - NIGHT \nWatching this is horror, Joe's about to run in just as BABABABABABABABAM!!! The creature JERKS UP from its almost- meal of Alice, looks toward the EXPLOSIVE SOUNDS, then LEAVES HER, quickly moving for the tunnel -- \nINT. TUNNEL #2 - NIGHT \nThe creature arrives in the SMOKE-FILLED TUNNEL, as the FIREWORKS FILL the tunnel with BRIGHT, MULTI-COLORED LIGHTS -- \nINT. MECHANICAL CONTRAPTION SPACE - NIGHT \nJoe SPRINTS in, gets to Alice -- lightly slaps her face -- \nJOE -- Alice, please -- please -- (nothing -- SLAP) Alice, wake up! \nNothing -- so he fucking SLAPS HER FACE HARD and she suddenly INHALES SHARPLY, he eyes WIDE, terrified -- \nJOE (CONT'D) Alice! You're alive! Can you hear me? Are you okay?! \nShe's CATCHING HER BREATH, nodding, looking at him, amazed -- \nALICE What is this? What are you doing here?! \nJOE I'm just-- doing the best I can to save you. \nShe GRABS HIM AND HUGS HIM TIGHT, teary and grateful -- during which -- quietly: \nALICE How did you know? \nJOE Your dad. He told me. He was worried. And flipping out. \nALICE Really? \nJOE -- we need to move-- \nBut she breaks out of the hug and grabs his shirt, intense: \nTINA (O.S.) Excuse me? \nTINA, a 24-year-old , disoriented woman with curlers in her hair, wakes up. \nTINA (CONT'D) Where are we? \nINT. MECHANICAL CONTRAPTION SPACE - NIGHT \nJoe and Alice have helped down one FAMILIAR FACE: SHERIFF PRUITT. They're out of breath, but their survival instinct has kicked in: \nTINA I left my bag in my car. Then I went to my car to get my bag-- \nALICE It's been experimented on for years. It's terrified and exhausted and hungry, it just wants to go home. When it touched me, I knew -- \nJOE Alice, help me get the sheriff down. \nTIME CUT: \nSHERIFF PRUITT Follow me. I can get us out of here. \nJOE Sheriff, we came that way. \n", "test1_input": "JOE I won't. Over. \nJoe turns off the walkie -- and he grabs a small plastic FISHERMAN'S TACKLE BOX as we HEAR: \nCHARLES (V.O.) Wanna hear something gross? \nCARY (V.O.) I do. \nMARTIN (V.O.) No please, if you're really asking. \nEXT. JOE'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nMidnight. Sitting on the curb with their GEAR and talking quietly, are Joe, Charles, Martin, Preston and Cary. Martin dressed in his detecting SUIT. Joe eats from a bag of Twizzlers. \nCHARLES I sneezed so hard yesterday I shit my pants. (THEY MOAN) I debated telling you. \nJOE Thanks. \nPRESTON That's called a \"sharteeze\" by the way. \nCHARLES CARY Well then I totally sharteezed in my pants. That's exactly what I'm talking about: the world is crazy, there's a name for everything... \nCHARLES Twizzler me. \nJoe passes him a Twizzler. \nMARTIN So... people are turning into zombies because of the chemical factory, right? \nCHARLES Martin? I don't see how the guy playing Detective Hathaway can ask where the zombies are coming from. \nCARY Another classic from Smartin. \nMARTIN I told you, I don't like it when you call me that. \nCARY I'm sorry, Smartin. \nMARTIN Shut up. \nJOE GUYS-- \nAll the boys look. Their faces BRIGHTEN. Headlights. The boys stand as the car STOPS beside them -- IT'S THE YELLOW BUICK WITH THE BLACK RACING STRIPE THAT PULLED UP TO JOE'S HOUSE DURING THE WAKE. But now, sitting in the driver's seat is 14- year-old ALICE DAINARD. She sees Joe. \nALICE Joe Lamb?! \nJOE -- yeah? \nALICE What the hell's he doing here? \nCHARLES Make-up, sound and special effects. \nALICE He's the deputy's kid! \nCHARLES JOE -- what? (touch flattered) -- you knew that? \nALICE (CONT'D) Charles, I don't have a license. I can't drive with him! \nCHARLES You want Joe to-- stay back? I--? \nALICE It's too late! He's seeing me in this car right now. \nJOE You can trust me. My dad'll never know. I won't tell him anything. \nLooking away, she's pissed. All the boys in silent wait. She considers, annoyed. Shakes her head. Finally: \nALICE Get in. \nThe boys EXCITEDLY SCRAMBLE into the car. \nEXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT \nThe Buick crosses the nighttime horizon, leaving the small town, driving through a rural landscape. \nPRESTON (V.O.) (TERRIFIED) You're driving very well. I'm impressed. \nINT. BUICK - NIGHT \nAlice drives. The boys shoved in the back with the gear -- in front Charles struggles with his backpack and camera bags as he pulls out PAGES, arranging them. With her driving, there's an unusual, electric energy in the air. Joe eats his Twizzlers in the back, trying not to stare at Alice. \nCHARLES So I wrote a couple new lines, can I show you? \nALICE What? \n", "test1_true": "CHARLES Shut up. There aren't a lot-- \nALICE I'm sorta trying to drive-- \nCHARLES What would be great is: could you cry during the scene? Can you do that? \nALICE ... no...?! \nCary messes with the radio. Alice moves his hand away. \nALICE (CONT'D) Stop. \nCARY You know the first place I'm gonna drive when I get my license? \nJOE (offering to Alice) Want one? \nAlice looks at him in the rear view. Their eyes hold a beat. \nCARY New Castle, Pennsylvania. Fireworks capital of America. \nShe takes the Twizzler he offers and looks back to the road. \nMARTIN So I don't have any new lines, right? Because I just learned these. \nCHARLES Shut up. \nPRESTON I have never been a passenger in a vehicle without an adult driving. I'm unresolved as to how I feel about it. \nEXT. RURAL OHIO - NIGHT \nThe Buick WOOSHES PAST a solitary KELVIN GAS STATION. The car dips into the darkness, beneath a blanket of stars. \nEXT. TRAIN DEPOT - NIGHT \nThe Buick pulls up to this small, EMPTY TRAIN STATION in the middle of, essentially, nowhere. A series of HANGING LIGHTS illuminates the TRAIN PLATFORM. There's a small office, currently closed. No one around. \nThe kids get out of the car. \nCHARLES Guys, there's an electrical socket up here. \nMARTIN Hey, Charles, Charles, do I have more lines? \nCHARLES No. But you can pick up some stuff. \nThe boys carry many bags and the tripod. \nPLATFORM - Charles looks at the scene through the \"lens\" he creates with both hands. \nCHARLES (CONT'D) Guys, this is going to be great. Get the lights and camera on that end, we'll shoot this direction first, like we talked about! Joe, get the mike plugged in-- make sure the new batteries are in the camera before you do the make-up! \nJOE Okay. \nJoe walks past Alive, who watches him. It strikes her that Joe is Charles' lackey. \nEXT. TRAIN DEPOT - PLATFORM - NIGHT \nMartin sits alone with his copy of the pages, quietly reading and memorizing his lines. \nMARTIN \"-- Sweetheart, this is my job, I have no choice.\" \"That's nothing you need to worry about...\" \"What am I suppose to go to Michigan with you...\" \nCary grabs his paper and throws it to the wind, sending Martin running after it. \nMARTIN (CONT'D) No, no, no. Cary. \nINT. PLATFORM \nPreston sets up the lights as Cary arrives to show him his backpack full of FIRECRACKERS: \nCARY I took apart two packs of cherry bombs and made my own M-80. \nPRESTON Your obsession with fireworks -- and I'm saying this as a friend -- concerns me. And my mother. \nCARY Well you're a pussy. And your mom has one. \nCary takes off. Martin returns with his paper. \nMARTIN Bogus, Cary. \nEXT. TRAIN DEPOT - PLATFORM - EDGE OF PLATFORM - NIGHT \nCharles writes in his notebook. He starts to get up... \n", "test2_input": "CHARLES JOE (turns to him) --okay-- Holy shit, that's mint. You're a total brain--! We gotta get the camera fixed and the film developed from last night-- I gotta go steal some more money from my mom! \nEXT. LILLIAN, OHIO - BRIDGE - MORNING \nJoe and Charles ride their bikes into town, across a BRIDGE, the massive STEEL MILL in the background -- \nCHARLES If any of the footage from last night is usable, that means we need Alice to play the wife again. \nJOE Yeah, I thought she was good. \nCHARLES She was mint, but she's never gonna do it. \nJOE I think she will. \nCHARLES There's no way. You heard what she said. \nJOE But that was before the new pages, right? \nCHARLES You honestly think she cares about the scenes? \nEXT. LILLIAN, OHIO - MAIN STREET - DAY \nTILT DOWN from the town's WATER TOWER -- Joe and Charles ride their bikes underneath it, crossing Main Street -- two large MILITARY TRUCKS drive past, we may note the Airman in the passenger seat SCANS THE AREA with a handheld device. \nCHARLES Man, did you hear what she said last night? \"I never should have done this!\" Dude, she was totally wigged! \nJOE Yes, she was, we all were. \nCHARLES Did you see her face? \nJOE Yeah, I saw her face. \nCHARLES Man, what's wrong with you? \nJOE Nothing. I think she's going to do it. \nThey park their bikes outside OLSEN CAMERA AND HI-FI. \nINSERT - WHITE PAGES \nThe book opens -- Joe's finger goes down -- finds \"LOUIS DAINARD\" and the phone number. We're in: \nINT. OLSEN CAMERA AND HI-FI - MORNING \nJoe at the counter, DIALING THE ROTARY PHONE, Charles behind him with DONNY, the 19-year-old, dark-haired, bearded salesman with a big collared button-down shirt. \nCHARLES Lens is cracked. Focus ring broke. (BEAT) Ya think it's fixable? \nJoe HEARS Alice's phone number RINGING. \nDONNY I think it's cheaper to buy a new one. \nCHARLES (TO JOE) We're screwed, man, it's over! \nJOE ALICE (V.O.) We can use my dad's camera -- it's got sound and-- Hello? \nJOE Alice-- hi, it's Joe. Lamb. \nAs Charles opens the camera, pulls out the film: \nALICE (V.O.) Hi... \nJOE So we have some new scenes. For the movie. We were hoping you'd be in `em. \nALICE (V.O.) Oh-- no. No, I'm done with that. \nJoe twirls a hanging Kodak \"RELIVE THE MEMORIES\" SUPER 8 film PROMOTIONAL SIGN, speaking in a soft voice: \nJOE Really? `Cause these are really good scenes. \nCharles hands the film cartridge to Donny. \nCHARLES We need this developed as soon as possible -- can you do overnight? \nDONNY Asshole, no one can do overnight. You wanna buy some pot? \nCharles reacts; he's never smoked anything. \nCHARLES ... no, thank you. \nDONNY You guys are weak. \n", "test2_true": "JOE Yeah, I know, I saw it. (CONCERNED) Are you okay? \nCHARLES Well, what's the fastest you can do? \nDONNY I can make it a rush, you get the film back in three days-- what's your sister up to? The hot one, not the other one. \nCHARLES I don't know. \nALICE (V.O.) I should go. \nJOE ALICE (V.O.) -- wait, hold on -- lemme come over and show you the pages, okay? I'll be right there. No, d-- \nEXT. ALICE'S HOUSE - DAY \nLower-lower-middle class house, set against woods. Joe with Alice at her front door. She seems unnerved: \nALICE I don't care what Charles wants-- I said no on the phone. \nJOE You totally did, that's true, I know, but-- \nALICE And now you're at my house. \nJOE I am, which-- under normal conditions I would nev-- \nALICE It's too weird after last night-- I don't understand how you guys can keep working on your stupid movie, I really don't. \nJOE We have to-- while the crash is still there. (waits, anxious, then, VERY SOFTLY:) ... please...? \nALICE (she considers, then:) No. \nBut Alice's eyes have flicked to the Buick, pulling up. \nALICE (CONT'D) You should go. \nJoe watches Louis get out of the car -- the man who got arrested at his mother's wake -- carrying a small grocery bag. He sees Joe and darkens as he approaches: \nLOUIS What's this? \nALICE He was just inviting me to a party. \nJoe steps back as Louis arrives; Louis seems to hate Joe, but at the same time, can barely look at him: \nLOUIS She's not going to your party. \nJOE Yessir. \nLouis throws Alice a dark, resentful glare. \nLOUIS You know better than this. \nShe nods, uncomfortable. Louis turns to Joe: \nLOUIS (CONT'D) You get outta her. You go home and don't come back, I don't wanna see you. \nLouis goes back inside. Alice follows, turns to Joe. As awkward moment between them. Then, quietly, conflicted: \nALIE I'll do it. \nJOE -- what? \nShe closes the door. Alone, despite it all, Joe is happy. Off his smile, we HEAR LOUD POPS: BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! \nEXT. HILLTOP - DAY \nMartin -- as Detective Hathaway -- FIRES A GUN -- shooting CARY, dressed in a dirty suit, as a man TURNING INTO A ZOMBIE -- his eyes WIDE AND GLOSSY WHITE -- and as he is HIT BY THE BULLETS, he SLAMS HIS HAND ONTO HIS CHEST -- BLOOD BURSTS ALL OVER HIM and he FALLS PAINFULLY TO THE GROUND. We then find CHARLES, behind his camera, yelling out: \nCHARLES CUT! That was mint! So good! And it looked huge with the train! Wow! Joe: go reload the cap gun! \nJOE OKAY -- \nWIDE SHOT, rising PAST SIX BICYCLES, thrown to the ground in a typical kid jumble. Charles, Joe and Preston, with Joe's dad's KODAK CAMERA on tripod, have been filming, their gear scattered. KEEP MOVING OVER THEM, to Martin and Alice, who were on camera. Beyond them, in the valley, the TRAIN CRASH seems to go forever. MILITARY TRUCKS, TENTS and SOLDIERS. HELICOPTERS buzz in the distant sky. Joe moves over to Alice, who looks out at the crash. During all this: \nCHARLES We'll get the other direction next - - Alice, that was mint-- Martin, go a little faster next time. \nMARTIN I'll try, but I'm still crying about last night, I feel like I'm crazy. \nCary sits, pulls off the CUT-OUT PING PONG BALLS that were covering his closed eyes. \nCARY Did it really look good? My death? \nCLOSE ON JOE as he arrives beside Alice, who looks out at the train, haunted. Quiet: \n", "test3_input": "A SHOT of the boys CLIMBING A FENCE. \nThey move fast across the alley, to a TRAILER locked with A PADLOCK -- the DUNGEON. \nJoe tries PRYING the locks off with the tire iron -- it doesn't budge. \nCHARLES Joe, let me try -- let me try. \nJoe hands the tire iron to Charles -- he tries -- nothing. \nAs Martin grabs the tire iron: \nCHARLES (CONT'D) Joe, this is impossible, man. \nMartin breaks off the LATCH -- BAM! \nCHARLES (CONT'D) --I loosened it for you. \nNow we CUT TO DARKNESS -- we're INSIDE THE DUNGEON as it opens -- the boys look DIRECTLY AT US -- their faces say it all: THE MOTHER LODE. \nJOE GUYS-- \nMARTIN CHARLES Look at all this junk. He's got movies in here. \nINT. MIDDLE SCHOOL HALL - DUSK \nThe boys -- with FLASHLIGHTS -- turn a corner -- hurry down the hall -- \nCHARLES I cannot believe we're breaking into school, who does that? No one does that-- idiots do that-- \nThe boys BREAK A CLASSROOM DOOR WINDOW and enter. \nINT. CLASSROOM - NIGHT - LATER \nWe're looking down at the boys, SURROUNDED by hundreds of documents, boxes, photographs, 16MM film cannisters and cassette tapes. Charles threads the film. \nJOE Dr. Woodward was dishonorably discharged from Nellis Air Base in 1963 because of \"subversive conduct,\" whatever that is. \nJoe holds up a 20-year-old PHOTO of MEN IN A LAB. Among them is 50-year-old WOODWARD: \nMARIN Dude, check it out. Old Man Woodward. \nCHARLES Back when he was like Middle-Aged Man Woodward. \nMARTIN -- He's been tracking this thing since like 1958. \nJOE (to the movie) What is this? \nCHARLES I don't know. It says April 8th, 1963 incident. I dunno. \nJOE Cary, we got to find this thing. \nCARY Sorry. \nCary puts a CASSETTE into a tape deck, hits PLAY: \nDR. WOODWARD (V.O.) JOE -- I told them this creature is more sophisticated than any of us. That his species -- that's him -- IS PREDOMINANTLY subterranean. He's being -- subterranean -- treated without compassion or respect.... \nVARIOUS SHOTS of PHOTOGRAPHS AND DOCUMENTS: \"UFO CRASH,\" \"MAJOR NELEC IN CHARGE OF OPERATIONS,\" \"TWO ALIEN BODIES, ONE LIVING,\" \"RESTRAINTS USED,\" \"EXPERIMENTS CONDUCTED\" -- as Charles threads a FILM: \nThe FILM: an AIR FORCE LOGO pops on and off. We see inside a HANGAR, where dozens of SCIENTISTS examine LARGE, BUS-SIZED pieces of jagged and unearthly material. All the while: \nDR. WOODWARD (V.O.) -- I explained that all he wants is to rebuild his ship. (MORE) DR. WOODWARD (V.O.) (CONT'D) A craft made up of those cubes of a complex, shape-shifting element-- remarkable material that we'll never fully understand. He has been desperate to reconstitute his ship since it crashed here in `58, but instead of giving him the help he needs, we've held him as a prisoner. He's been restrained and experimented upon -- Through pain and lack of compassion, we have taught him to hate us all. We've turned him into an enemy. \nScientist explaining something to a group of SENIOR OFFICERS. Among them, a 32-year-old NELEC. \nFilm JUMP CUTS to a HUGE REINFORCED LAB CAGE. Inside, sitting almost in a ball, IS THE MASSIVE CREATURE. Hard to see here. Another JUMP CUT as a SOLDIER offers a bucket of FOOD to the alien -- IT'S WOODWARD. \nCARY Guys, it's Dr. Woodward. Look. \nWoodward offers what looks like RAW MEAT to the motionless, sitting CREATURE. All the boys watch quietly -- then, suddenly, in milliseconds, the creature is UP, GRABBING WOODWARD THROUGH THE BARS -- the boys JUMP -- \nCHARLES MARTIN Arh! I can't watch that! \nDR. WOODWARD (V.O.) I told them I knew these things because he made contact with me. That he makes a psychic connection by touch. The moment we made contact, I understood him and he, me. What I know is that if we don't change this and start helping him, we will all pay the price. But Nelec won't listen-- \nThe boys are SCARED as they watch the creature HOLD WOODWARD TIGHT -- LIFT HIM -- and its TENTACLES suddenly THRUST into his NOSE, EARS and MOUTH -- \nJoe stands and looks intently at the screen. \nJOE Woodward wasn't trying to kill it. \n", "test3_true": "Just then a MUFFLED SHATTER-CRASH -- \nMARTIN Did you hear that? \nSuddenly BOOM! The doors BURST OPEN and ARMED COMMANDOS, NIGHT VISION GOGGLES OBSCURING THEIR FACES, AIMING SEMI-AUTO WEAPONS AT THE BOYS WHO SCREAM -- \nCHARLES COMMANDO DON'T KILL US! PLEASE DON'T (calls on radio) KILL US!!! PLEASE DON'T KILL -- we've got civilians -- US!!! minors-- four of `em. \nINT. DONNY'S CAR - NIGHT \nDonny gets stoned in his car. Doesn't notice the MOVEMENT in the distance behind him. The MILITARY coming in. \nINT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - NIGHT \nThe locker hallway: the Boys are HANDCUFFED AND SCARED, being led out by ARMED SOLDIERS. Nelec moves to them. QUIETLY: \nCHARLES -- oh shit! \nNELEC Search them. \nOvermyer CHECKS THEIR POCKETS as Nelec TAKES CARY'S BACKPACK, opens it -- pulls out some FIREWORKS. Proudly: \nCARY I rolled those M-80's myself, that's right. \nNELEC (eyes flick to Joe) You're the Deputy's boy. \nJoe's terrified as Overmyer pulls from Joe's pocket a couple COINS, half a pack of Bubble Yum and HIS MOTHER'S NECKLACE. Drops everything but the necklace. Joe reacts, panicked -- \nJOE -- hey, no-- \nNELEC (TO OVERMYER) Move out. \nJoe's on the verge of tears as Overmyer POCKETS the necklace. Off the TERRIFIED BOYS as they're ushered away -- \nEXT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - NIGHT \nThe BOYS are put onto the bus -- BOOM DOWN to DONNY'S CAR IN THE FOREGROUND, where we realize that WE HAVEN'T BEEN THE ONLY AUDIENCE TO THIS: Donny, sunk deep in his seat, hiding, watches wide-eyed as the bus DRIVES AWAY. \nDONNY ... oh shit... \nHis stoned mind races. Staying hidden from the remaining military, Donny scrambles for his CB, turns to CHANNEL 9, grabs the mike, speaks quietly, frantic: \nDONNY (CONT'D) Breaker breaker, requesting police backup, over?! Breaker breaker, is this the police channel? \nINT.

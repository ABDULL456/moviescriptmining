It'll be a very fast clean-up. \nJACK Colonel, there isn't anything I should know, is there? \nNELEC Not that I can think of, Deputy. I understand you have concerns about our cargo. \nJACK I'd like to see that manifest, yes. \nNELEC That's not going to be possible. \nJACK Colonel, I've got a lot of people in my town that are gonna want to know what's taking place. \nNELEC -- what town is that? \nJACK ...

Airplane parts sorta make sense. \nJACK Sheriff, I'm telling you, there's something else going on -- they're taking molds of tire tracks -- now why would they be doing that? Who are they looking for?

Somehow Nelec takes this moment to look into Joe's face -- to silently -- in a look -- repent. Instantly, Joe knows he's about to watch this man's life end. \nSMASH! Nelec turns -- the creature is BUSTING the bus door -- SMASHING AT IT -- to make it BIGGER. So it can get inside.

Pieces of metal and glass BURST like ice chips as the creature violently WIDENS the bus door opening-- \nOn Charles' shoulders, Joe can reach the shattered-but-thick window -- which he must HIT -- BREAK OPEN to get out -- essentially exactly what the creature is doing, in reverse. \nUsing both fists, Joe POUNDS the window. No give. \nMARTIN CARY Harder! Come on, you PUSSY!!! \nWith all his might, Joe hits the window again -- the SLIGHTEST sound of glass adjusting -- meanwhile, SLAM!!!

Joe, move!!! \nWith all the boys helping, Joe pulls himself up -- outside the bus, Joe peeks out -- the fucking creature -- its back to Joe -- just fifteen feet away, focused on the door -- and Joe strains to climb out here, onto the top-side of the bus. \nAnd as the boys climb out, the creature climbs in -- first Joe, then Charles (AD LIB DIALOGUE WITH CARY AND MARTIN: \"You gotta lose some weight --\" \"I know!!!\"), Then Cary, and Martin last -- they all jump down to the dirt -- they hear SCREAMS and turn back for a moment -- \nInside the bus, Nelec watches as the creature ENTERS THE TIGHT-FITTING BUS, SMASHING BENCHES, MAKING ITS WAY TERRIFYINGLY DOWN THE AISLE TOWARD HIM. And as the creature descends upon him, in the silence before the final lunge -- Nelec says, eerily quietly, terrified: \nNELEC -- it was my turn once... to find you. Now... it's your t-- \nBefore he can finish, the creature fucking ATTACKS -- and it would be horrible and brutal, if the BLOOD DIDN'T SPRAY UPON THE BULLETPROOF GLASS -- WHICH OUR CAMERA IS SAFELY BEHIND -- OBSCURING THE NIGHTMARISH VIEW. \nIn the field, a distance away, the boys watch the bus SHUDDER and SHAKE. Then... silence. They see the creature burst out of the bus -- then RUN OFF -- fast and stealthy, away from them in the overgrown grass, like a native hunter. Which, of course, is partly what it is. They're sort of stunned. \nCHARLES I just sharteezed a little. \nINT. GREENVILLE AIR FORCE BASE HANGAR - NIGHT \nLouis stares off, lost.

NEIGHBORHOOD HOUSE - NIGHT \n-- they run in for cover -- they're silhouetted in this dark space by the EXPLOSION LIGHT emanating from the windows. They're all out of breath in a strange KITCHEN -- \nCARY You guys see those explosions? They were huge. \nMARTIN -- whose house is this? \nCARY (he hands him a picture) Kathy's.

They all go down -- but Martin is in agony all of a sudden -- his leg RIPPED by concrete. If there's good news here, the creature has left this area -- the explosions getting further away. But there's blood and Martin is in real pain. \nMARTIN What happened to my leg? It hurts. \nCHARLES Oh shit, Martin, you gotta bone sticking out of your leg! \nCARY There's a hole in the house! \nCHARLES Joe, gimme that thing on the curtains! \nCharles wants the tie around the curtains, still hanging on the wall that now has a HOLE in it; MILITARY VEHICLES can be seen driving past outside.

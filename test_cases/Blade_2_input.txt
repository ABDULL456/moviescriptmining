Meanwhile, Blade traps Mercury's other hand, disarming her, flipping her over his shoulder. He hefts his Casull, BLASTING her into eternity -- 
A bloodbath ensues. Blade moves like speed-personified, FIRING off one, two, THREE HEADSHOTS with brain-numbing accuracy, cutting down the vampires where they stand. 
It's an orgy of gunpowder smoke and showering bodily fluids and -CLICK-CA-CHING-CLICK!- Blade and Karen have spent their bullets and -- 
FROST (O.S.) Enough!!! 
Blade turns to face -- 
FROST, 
who's advancing, clutching Blade's own sword in his hand. He thrusts the sword forward -- 
Blade presses the grip-trigger on his punching dagger -CHING!- the two side blades spread out. We hear the RASP and CLANG of metal on metal as Blade manages to trap the sword-point between two of the dagger blades -- 
For a moment, both men are eye to eye, their weapons locked together, then, Frost forces Blade backwards -- 
What happens next is the most blindingly-fast sword fight ever exposed to celluloid. Both men, fueled by super-human speed, lunge and spin across the cavern floor in a blurred ballet of lethal moves. 
Frost lands a powerful blow on Blade's shoulder, the sword-edge biting deep into the flesh. Blade SCREAMS. Frost withdraws the sword for another strike -- 
-- until Blade sees an opening and takes it, slicing Frost's left arm off at the shoulder -- 
The severed arm releases Blade's sword, but the arm doesn't fall! To Frost and Blade's mutual surprise the arm floats in mid-air, bleeding red, quivering like zero-G liquid, then SLURPING back to Frost's arm- stump to re-attach itself! 
Undaunted, Blade slices the punching dagger into Frost's mid-section, meeting only liquid-like resistance. The moment Blade withdraws his dagger, Frost's flesh seals itself up again. 
Blade hesitates now, uncertain -- and Frost laughs, understanding what has happened. 
FROST You're too late, Blade. I'm already changing. Don't you see? The Sleeper has awakened. I'm not just Frost anymore. I'm becoming a god now, blood incarnate. 
Even as Frost utters the words, his body begins to ripple and morph, bleeding red, taking on the characteristics of liquid. He doesn't walk so much now as flow. He's become a three-dimensional creature of animated blood! A blood demon. 
ON KAREN, 
as she watches Frost's transformation, wide-eyed. She SEES Blade's discarded sword, reaches for it -- suddenly, a SHADOW moves on the periphery of her vision -- 
VANESSA 
rushes at Karen in a near-blur. The SNARLING hellion is upon Karen in an eye-blink, SLAMMING her down against the temple floor, pinning her. 
VANESSA Did you think I'd forgotten you, you little whore? 
BACK TO FROST, 
who towers above Blade, swaying back and forth in his new, liquid- like form. 
FROST You can't hurt me anymore. 
WHOOSH! Frost rises upwards on a spiraling column of blood, HOWLING WITH LAUGHTER, then just as suddenly -- 
-- splashes back to earth, spreading out in a widening pool. In the blink of an eye, he streams through Blade's feet, re-solidifying behind Blade. Blade spins, swings his dagger -- 
Once again, Frost morphs into blood-form. He races around Blade in a series of spouting arcs, turning from blood-form to solid and back again in a series of split-second transformations. 
Blade whirls, striking with his dagger and missing every time -- 
WHOOSH! Frost suddenly dissipates, SPLASHING away into a million zero-G blood bubbles, vanishing. Blade spins, unnerved, trying to pin-point his foe's next manifestation. 
BLADE Where are you?! 
Frost's voice answers from all directions. 
FROST Everywhere. 
A DROPLET OF BLOOD 
spatters the floor at Blade's feet. Blade looks up -- 
A SHOWER OF BLOOD 
rains from above, coalescing into Frost as he sweeps down on Blade like a giant bird of prey, crushing him against the temple floor. 
FROST You want my blood so much?! Take it! 
Frost's arms elongate and liquefy, flowing into two snake-like spouts of blood -- the rest of Frost remains solid. The blood-spouts twist around Blade's neck, melding together, completely encasing Blade's head in a bubble of blood. 
Blade claws at the blood-bubble as if it were a solid object that he could dislodge, but his fingers just pass through it!

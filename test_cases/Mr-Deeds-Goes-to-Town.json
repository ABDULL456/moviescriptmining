{"train": "MR DEEDS GOES TO TOWN \nWritten by Robert previous hit Riskin \nbased on a story by Clarence Budington Kelland \nFADE IN \nEXTERIOR - MONTAGE \n1. Quick shots of a car speeding around curves in a mountainous region. The car jumps a bridge, hurtles into space, crashes in a fireball. Followed by newsboys hawking special editions, people on streetcorners buying and reading newspapers with a succession of banner headlines: \n\"MARTIN W. SEMPLE, FINANCIER, DIES IN ITALY,\" \n\"CIVIC LEADER KILLED IN AUTO ACCIDENT,\" \n\"DISCLOSURE OF BANKER'S WILL AWAITED\" and finally \"SEMPLE HEIR AS YET UNKNOWN\" \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINTERIOR - EDITOR'S OFFICE, DAILY MAIL \n2. CLOSE SHOT \nof Mac, the editor, at his desk, barking into the telephone. \nMAC \nSay listen, Corny, who do you think you're talking to? If the Semple attorneys don't know who the heir is, who does? \n(listens) \nAw, come on Corny, I've done you a lot of favors. What do you say - who's getting the Semple dough? \nCUT TO: \nINTERIOR - CEDAR'S PRIVATE OFFICE \n3. CLOSE SHOT \nOf Cornelius Cobb - a hardened ex-newspaperman, customarily impatient, grouchy and nervous - victim of the New York tempo. His friends call him \"Corny.\" \nCOBB \n(on the phone) \nYou're asking the wrong guy, Mac. I'm only a press agent. \nTHE CAMERA PULLS BACK GRADUALLY TO REVEAL a plush law office, leather chairs and shelves of books. Arthur Cedar, attorney, briskly enters scene and seats himself at his desk. Cedar is in the neighborhood of fifty - grey-templed - dignified - sharp. Cobb is using the phone on his desk. Cedar glances at him. \nCEDAR \nNewspaperman? \nCOBB \n(covering mouthpiece - confidentially) \nWants to know who the heir is. \nCEDAR \n(firmly) \nHang up. \nCOBB \n(returning to the phone) \nSorry, Mac, I can't. Yeah, Mac. Sure, but I ain't the attorney\u0097 \nCEDAR \n(more firmly) \nHang up. \nTHE CAMERA PULLS BACK FURTHER TO REVEAL another attorney at one end of the desk, reviewing a pile of papers. \nCOBB \n(continuing) \nMr. Cedar is, and I haven't seen him in two days. \n(hangs up the phone) \nListen, Cedar, we've got to do something about the newspapers. \nCEDAR \n(barely glancing up) \nI'm not interested in the newspapers. \nCOBB \nBut it's a great story. Somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks. \nCEDAR \nYes, I know. My first concern is to locate the lucky man. When I do, it's your job to keep the newspapers away from him. \nCOBB \n(resignedly) \nIt's okay with me as long as my weekly stipend keeps coming in. \nTHE CAMERA PULLS BACK TO A FULL SHOT as two men rush in with a flurry of excitement. One of them is Anderson, an obsequious employee of Cedar's. With him is another lawyer, one of the Cedar brothers. \nANDERSON \nWe located him, Mr. Cedar! We found out where he is. \nCEDAR \nGood! \nFIRST BROTHER \nYes, John, we got him. \nANDERSON \nHere's the report: Longfellow Deeds, single, 28, lives in Mandrake Falls, Vermont. \nCEDAR \n(glancing at the report) \nThank heaven. \nFIRST BROTHER \nBetter wire him right away, John. \nCEDAR \nI'll do no such thing. I'm going there myself. You're going with me too, Anderson - and you too, Cobb. \nHe pushes a button on the intercom. \nVOICE \nYes? \nCEDAR \nMake three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont. \nVOICE \n(skeptically) \nWhere? \nCEDAR \nMandrake Falls. \n(begins to spell as scene fades) \nM-A-N\u0097 \nCUT TO: \nEXT. A STATION \n4. MEDIUM SHOT \nIt is a pleasantly rural scene - with just a handful of local characters scattered about. At one end of the platform - some mail - newspapers - and a few pieces of freight are being loaded. Cedar, Cobb and Anderson stand in front of a welcome sign. The three obviously are out of their element here - obviously \"City folks.\" \nOver their shoulders. We hear Cobb's voice as he reads: \nCOBB'S VOICE \nWelcome to Mandrake Falls - \nWhere the scenery enthralls - \nWhere no hardship e'er befalls - \nWelcome to Mandrake Falls. \n5. MEDIUM SHOT \nCobb and Cedar exchange glances. \nCOBB \nThat's pretty. \nCEDAR \nAre you sure this is the town he lives in? \nANDERSON \nYes sir, Mr. Cedar. This is the town all right. \nCEDAR \nWell, I dropped everything at the office - I hope it's not a wild goose chase. \nANDERSON \nNo, sir. We checked it thoroughly. He lives here all right. \nCOBB \nAh! I spy a native. Let's ask him. \nCAMERA MOVES WITH THEM as they cross to a small, one-story old brick building, covered with ivy. This is the ticket and freight office combined. In front of it is a very old man, a stoop- \nshouldered rail agent with a face of a million wrinkles - puttering around some packages. \nCEDAR \n(as they approach) \nGood morning. \nAGENT \n(glances up) \nIsn't it a lovely sentiment? \nCOBB \n(flatly) \nYeah. \nA dog enters, racing toward the door, scratching at it and whining. \nMRS. MEREDITH \n(as she heads toward the door) \nHere he is now. \nShe opens the door and goes out, with the dog racing ahead. \nCOBB \n(to Cedar - sotto voce) \nI suggest you break it to him gently. He's liable to keel over from the shock. \nMrs. Meredith re-appears. We hear her voice as she comes through the doorway. \nMRS. MEREDITH \nThey've been waiting a long while. \nLongfellow Deeds trails behind her. \nLONGFELLOW \nWho are they? \nMRS. MEREDITH \nI don't know. \nCEDAR \n(standing - formally) \nMr. Longfellow Deeds? \nLONGFELLOW \nYes. \nCEDAR \nHow do you do. \nLONGFELLOW \n(shaking hands) \nHow do you do. \nCEDAR \n(extending card) \nI'm John Cedar - of the New York firm of Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington. \n13. CLOSE SHOT - GROUP \nFeaturing Cobb. He watches Longfellow who is glancing at the card. \nLONGFELLOW \n(reads to himself) \nCedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington. \n(looks up; smiles) \nBudington must feel like an awful stranger, hmm? \nCobb's eyes pop at the nifty.[1] \nCEDAR \nMr. Cornelius Cobb and Mr. Anderson. \nThey exchange greetings. Longfellow gestures to chairs. \nLONGFELLOW \nYou gentlemen make yourselves comfortable. \nCOBB AND ANDERSON \nThanks. \n14. MEDIUM SHOT \nLongfellow crosses to his tuba near a chair. He takes a mouthpiece out of his pocket. \nLONGFELLOW \nNew mouthpiece. Been waiting two weeks for this. Kids keep swiping them all the time. They use 'em for bean shooters. \n(he blows a note) \nWhat can I do for you gentlemen? \nMRS. MEREDITH \nYou gentlemen going to stay for lunch? \nCEDAR \n(right to the point; ignoring her) \nI'd like to ask you a few questions. \nLONGFELLOW \nAll right. \nLongfellow looks at them strangely and sits down beside his tuba. \nCEDAR \nMr. Deeds, are you the son of Dr. Joseph and Mary Deeds? \nLONGFELLOW \nYes. \nCEDAR \nAre your parents living? \nLONGFELLOW \nWhy, no. \nCEDAR \nMr. Deeds, does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you? \nLONGFELLOW \nNot much. He's an uncle of mine, I think. I never saw him, but my mother's name was Semple, you know. \nCEDAR \nWell, he passed on. He was killed in a motor accident in Italy. \nLONGFELLOW \nHe was? Gee, that's too bad. If there's anything I can do to\u0097 \nWhile he speaks, he has been adjusting the tuba between his legs and now sucks on the mouthpiece, preparatory to playing. \nCEDAR \nI have good news for you, sir. Mr. Semple left a large fortune when he died. He left it all to you, Mr. Deeds. Deducting the taxes, it amounts to something in the neighborhood of $20,000,000. \n15. CLOSEUP - LONGFELLOW \nHis lips are over the mouthpiece of the tuba. His only reaction to the startling news is to lift his eyes in Cedar's direction. \n16. GROUP SHOT \nMRS. MEREDITH \nHow about lunch? Are the gentlemen going to stay - or not? \nLONGFELLOW \nOf course they're going to stay. \n(to the gentlemen) \nShe's got some fresh orange layer cake. You know, with the thick stuff on the top? \n(to Mrs. Meredith) \nSure, they don't want to go to the hotel. \nMrs. Meredith leaves. Cobb and Cedar have watched this by-play, open-mouthed, and are now even more astounded to see Longfellow blow into his tuba. \n17. CLOSER SHOT - THE THREE \nCEDAR \n(over the noise of the tuba) \nPerhaps you didn't hear what I said, Mr. Deeds! The whole Semple fortune goes to you! $20,000,000! \nLONGFELLOW \nOh, yes, I heard you all right. $20,000,000. That's quite a lot, isn't it? \nCOBB \nOh, it'll do in a pinch. \nLONGFELLOW \n(impressed) \nYes, indeed. I wonder why he left me all that money? I don't need it. \nHe resumes his 'Oom-pahs.' \n18. CLOSE SHOT - CEDAR AND COBB \nStaring, unbelievingly. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. AN ALCOVE \n19. FULL SHOT \nThe three men sit around a table, having lunch. By Longfellow's side is, as expected, the tuba. \nCEDAR \nMr. Cobb here is an ex-newspaperman associated with your uncle for many years - as a sort of buffer. \nLONGFELLOW \nOf train approaching. \n27. CLOSE SHOT - CEDAR AND COBB \nThe band has already begun and is now in the midst of \"For He's A Jolly Good Fellow.\" \nAt this moment, as he looks off, a startled expression comes into Cobb's eyes. He grabs Cedar by the arm - who glances in the direction he points. \nCOBB \nLook! \nCEDAR \nWhat? \nCOBB \nThat tuba player! \n28. MEDIUM SHOT - THE BAND \nWith Longfellow, in his customary position, blowing on his tuba. \nCONTINUATION SCENE 27 \nCedar and Cobb stare, wide-eyed, as the song is finished. \nCOBB \nWell, now I've seen everything. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. STATION \n29. LONG SHOT \nIn the b.g. is the train with Longfellow standing on the observation platform, clutching his tuba. On either side of him is Cedar and Cobb. In the f.g. the crowd yells its farewell. Several of them stuff baskets of fruit into his hands. The band plays \"Auld Lang Syne.\" \n30. CLOSE SHOT \nOver Longfellow and Cobb's shoulders. As the train begins pulling out. Longfellow smiles wanly and waves. \nLONGFELLOW \nGoodbye, Mrs. Meredith! Goodbye, Jim! Bye, Buddy! Goodbye, everybody! \n(a pause) \nGosh, I've got a lot of friends. \nCobb looks up into Longfellow's face - affected by the scene. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. TRAIN DRAWING ROOM \n31. FULL SHOT \nLongfellow is slumped in his seat, his legs sprawled out, his eyes ceilingward - in deep thought. Cobb sits across from him. Cedar enters, hangs up his coat, hat and cane. \nCOBB \n(opening a snifter - generously) \nHave a drink? \nLONGFELLOW \n(distractedly) \nNo, thanks. \nCobb and Cedar exchange a look. \nCEDAR \nWill you have a cigar? \nLONGFELLOW \nNo, thank you. \nCedar sits down. \nCEDAR \n(breaking the silence) \nI wouldn't worry if I were you. Of course, a large fortune like this entails a great responsibility - but you'll have a good deal of help. So don't worry. Leave everything to me. \nLONGFELLOW \nOh, I wasn't worried about that. \nCEDAR \nNo? \nLONGFELLOW \nI was wondering where they're going to get another tuba player for the band. \nCobb has just finished taking a drink and can't help but nearly spit it out. \nFADE OUT: \nFADE IN \n32. LONG SHOT (STOCK) \nThe 20th Century crossing the Harlem River. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n33. ANOTHER STOCK SHOT \nOf the 20th Century going under the street level on Park Avenue. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n34. CLOSE SHOT OF OFFICE DOOR \nUpon which we read: \"CEDAR, CEDAR & BUDINGTON - ENTRANCE.\" CAMERA PULLS BACK to take in Cedar, who opens the door and walks through. \nINT. GENERAL OFFICE \n35. CLOSE TRUCKING SHOT \nWith Cedar as he strides across the room - in business-like fashion. He comes to a door marked \"PRIVATE OFFICES.\" He pushes this door opens and disappears. \nMAN'S VOICE \n(as Cedar passes by) \nHello, John. Where have you been? \nCEDAR \n(as he walks briskly) \nI've been fishing. \nIn the background is typical office hub-bub. \nCEDAR \n(to a secretary as he passes) \nGood morning, Celia. \nSECRETARY \nGood morning, Mr. Cedar. \nA chorus of \"Good Morning, Mr. Cedar!\" issues from the clerks. A secretary looks up. \nINT. PRIVATE OFFICES \n36. CLOSE TRUCKING SHOT \nWith Cedar - as he passes through the room - arriving at a door marked \"JOHN CEDAR, PRIVATE.\" He goes through the door. \nINT. CEDAR'S PRIVATE OFFICES - ANTEROOM \n37. FULL SHOT \nCedar breezes in and speaks to a secretary. \nCEDAR \nGood morning. Where are they? \nSECRETARY \nWaiting for you in the other office. \nHe strides across the room to still another door marked \"PRIVATE\" and he disappears. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. CEDAR'S PRIVATE OFFICE \n38. FULL SHOT \nA group of associates sit around in large leather chairs, as Cedar barges in. \nCEDAR \n(beaming) \nGood morning. Hello, boys. \nThe men come to life. Some rise - others lean forward. Two of them are brothers of Cedar - tall and athletic. The third is a small, frightened-looking man. He is Budington. \nMEN \n(ad lib) \nHello, John. \nWhat happened? \nWell, what's he like? \nCEDAR \nWe've got nothing to worry about. He's as naive as a child. \nBUDINGTON \nJohn\u0097 \nCEDAR \nClose that door. \n(into dictograph) \nWill you get Mrs. Cedar on the phone, please? \nFIRST BROTHER \nCome on, John. What happened? \nCEDAR \nMAC \nUh-huh. \nBABE \n(casually, as she starts away) \nLeave four columns open on the front page tomorrow. \n47. MEDIUM SHOT \nAs Babe crosses to door. \nMAC \nNow you're talking, Babe. I'll keep the whole front page open. What are you going to do? \nBABE \n(at door) \nHave lunch. \nShe exits. Mac's face lights up happily. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. RESIDENCE \n48. LONG SHOT \nOf a large, imposing-looking residence. \nINT. LONGFELLOW'S BEDROOM \n49. MEDIUM SHOT \nLongfellow stands awkwardly between two tailors - who chalk and pin a suit on him. After a few seconds of silence: \nLONGFELLOW \nIt's the first time I ever had a suit made on purpose. \nThe tailors smile accommodatingly as CAMERA PULLS BACK and we discover that both Cedar and Cobb are present. Cobb is slumped in a chair, and Cedar is carefully putting some papers away in a portfolio. \nCEDAR \nIt's merely a suggestion. I don't wish to press the point, Mr. Deeds, but if you'll give me your Power of Attorney we'll take care of everything. It'll save you a lot of petty annoyances. Every shark in town will be trying to sell you something. \nLONGFELLOW \nOh, yes, there've been a lot of them around here already. Strangest kind of people. Salesmen - politicians - moochers - all want something. I haven't had a minute to myself. Haven't seen Grant's Tomb yet. \nCEDAR \nWell, you see, your uncle didn't bother with that sort of thing. He left everything to us. He traveled most of the time, and enjoyed himself. You should do the same thing, Mr. Deeds. \nLONGFELLOW \nBesides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too? \nCEDAR \nYes. That is to say\u0097 \nLONGFELLOW \nWell, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost? \nCEDAR \n(too quickly) \nOh - nothing. No extra charge. \nLONGFELLOW \nThat involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it? \nCEDAR \n(generously) \nYes, but that's an added service a firm like Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington usually donates. \nLONGFELLOW \nBudington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington yet. \n50. WIDER ANGLE \nAs a butler stands in the doorway. \nBUTLER \nThe gentlemen from the opera are still waiting in the board room, sir. They're getting a trifle impatient, sir. \nLONGFELLOW \nThey are? I forgot all about them. \n(to Cobb) \nWhat do you think they want? \nCEDAR \nWell, your uncle was Chairman of the Board of Directors. They probably expect you to carry on. \nCOBB \n(rising) \nI'll tell those mugs to keep their shirts on, that you'll be right down. \nLONGFELLOW \nThanks \n(suddenly) \nOh, did you send that telegram to Jim Mason? \nCOBB \nJim Mason? Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I didn't send it. I've got it written out, though. Here it is. \n(reaches into his pocket and reads) \n\"Arthur's been with the Tallow Works too long. STOP. Don't think we should fire him. Longfellow.\" \nLONGFELLOW \nFine. Send it right away. I don't want him to fire Arthur. \nCOBB \nOh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur. \nLONGFELLOW \nHe was the last baby my father delivered, Arthur was. \nCEDAR \nI think you ought to give this matter some thought, Mr. Deeds. \nLONGFELLOW \nHuh? \nCEDAR \nI mean, about the Power of Attorney. \nLONGFELLOW \nOh, yes. Yes, I will. \nCobb has stalled long enough to hear Longfellow's decision before he goes out of the room. \nLONGFELLOW \nI'll give it a lot of thought. There was a fellow named Winslow here a little while ago, wanted to handle my affairs for nothing too. It puzzles me why these people all want to work for nothing. It isn't natural. So I guess I'd better think about it some more. \n51. MEDIUM SHOT \nLongfellow, Cedar and the two tailors. \nTAILOR \nThat's that. \nLONGFELLOW \nYou go to an awful lot of work to keep a fellow warm, don't you? \nTAILOR \nYes, sir. \nA butler enters again. \nBUTLER \nA Mr. Hallor to see you sir. \nCEDAR \n(quickly) \nDid you say Hallor? \nBUTLER \nYes, sir. \nCEDAR \nWell, don't let him in. \nLONGFELLOW \nWhy not? Who is he? \nCEDAR \nA lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate. \n(to butler) \nTell him to see me at my office. \nLONGFELLOW \nWell, if he has a claim, we'd better see him. \n(to butler) \nSend him in. \nThe butler disappears. \nCEDAR \nHe's capable of causing you a lot of trouble, Mr. Deeds. \n(to Cobb) \nI'm Chairman. \nCOBB \n(dryly) \nHappy voyage. \nDOUGLAS \nRight here, Mr. Deeds. \n57. WIDER ANGLE \nAs Longfellow is led to the president's chair. Douglas sits next to him. \nDOUGLAS \nNow, the next order of business is the reading of the Secretary's minutes . \nA VOICE \nMove we dispense with it. \nANOTHER VOICE \nSecond. \nDOUGLAS \nAll in favor? \nCHORUS OF VOICES \nAye! \nLongfellow looks his surprise. \nDOUGLAS \nI think they can be dispensed with. We're ready now for the reading of the Treasurer's report. \nA VOICE \nMove we dispense with it. \nANOTHER VOICE \nSecond. \nDOUGLAS \nAll in favor? \nCHORUS OF VOICES \nAye! \nDOUGLAS \nQuite right! Now, gentlemen, the next business will be\u0097 \n58. MED. CLOSE SHOT \nFeaturing Longfellow, as he interrupts: \nLONGFELLOW \nWait a minute. What does the Chairman do? \nDOUGLAS \nWhy, the Chairman presides at the meetings. \nLONGFELLOW \nThat's what I thought. If you don't mind, I'm rather interested in the Treasurer's report. I'd like to hear it. \nThere is an uncomfortable shuffle. For a few minutes, no one speaks. From the rear, a tall man rises. \n59. CLOSE SHOT \nFeaturing treasurer. \nTREASURER \nThe treasurer reports a deficit of $180,000 for the current year. \n60. CLOSE SHOT - LONGFELLOW \nHe is stunned. \nLONGFELLOW \nA deficit! You mean we've lost that much? \n61. WIDER ANGLE \nTo include all at table. \nDOUGLAS \nYou see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted for profit. \nLONGFELLOW \nIt isn't? What is it conducted for? \nDOUGLAS \nWhy, it's an artistic institution\u0097 \nLONGFELLOW \nWe own an opera house, don't we? \nA VOICE \nWe do. \nLONGFELLOW \nAnd we give shows? \nDOUGLAS \nWe provide opera. \nLONGFELLOW \nBut you charge. I mean, you sell tickets? \nVOICE \nOf course. \nLONGFELLOW \nAnd it doesn't pay? \nDOUGLAS \nThat's impossible. The opera has never paid. \nLONGFELLOW \n(conclusively) \nWell, then, we must give the wrong kind of shows. \nCobb smiles. The directors are stumped. \n62. MED. CLOSE SHOT \nFeaturing Douglas and Longfellow. \nDOUGLAS \nThe wrong kind! There isn't any wrong or right kind. Opera is opera! \nLONGFELLOW \nI guess it is. But I personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. That wouldn't be common sense. Incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from? \nDOUGLAS \nWell, we were rather expecting it to come from you. \nLONGFELLOW \nMe?! \nDOUGLAS \nNaturally. \nLONGFELLOW \nExcuse me, gentlemen, there's nothing natural about that . \nHe is suddenly startled. His ears prick up. \n63. SHOT OF DIRECTORS \nThey all stare at Longfellow. Over scene comes the low wailing cry of a siren, which increases in volume as it gets closer to the building. \n64. MEDIUM SHOT \nLongfellow jumps up. \nLONGFELLOW \nHey, a fire engine! \nHe rushes to the window and peers out. The others stare unbelievably. The shriek of the siren finally dies down. Longfellow turns back. \nLONGFELLOW \n(admiringly) \nGee, that was a pip![4] \n(as he goes back to his seat) \nWe expect we're going to have one like that in Mandrake Falls pretty soon \u0096 with a siren, too. \nThere is a pause while he gets seated. \nLONGFELLOW \nNow, where were we? \n65. MED. CLOSE SHOT AT TABLE \nDOUGLAS \nYou see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business. \nLONGFELLOW \nWhy not? \nDOUGLAS \nBecause it just isn't a business, that's all! \nBeautiful. \nLONGFELLOW \nOnly common sense. \n71. MED. SHOT \nCedar has been most uncomfortable through the scene, but now suavely assumes an admiring attitude. \nCEDAR \n(a forced smile) \nI can't hold out any longer either, Mr. Deeds. \n(holds out his hand) \nBeing an attorney for you will be a very simple affair. \nLONGFELLOW \nYou're not my attorney yet, Mr. Cedar. Not till I find out what's on your mind. Suppose you get the books straightened out quick so I can have a look at them. \nCEDAR \nYes, of course, if you wish. But you must be prepared. This sort of thing will be daily routine. \n(picks up his hat) \nIf it becomes annoying, you let me know. Goodbye, Mr. Deeds. Goodbye, sir. \nLongfellow shakes his hand. Cedar exits. Longfellow stares after him disgustedly, wiping his hands with his handkerchief. \nLONGFELLOW \nEven his hands are oily. \nWalter has entered and holds up a coat for Longfellow. \nCOBB \nWell, how about tonight? What would you like in the way of entertainment? \nLONGFELLOW \nEntertainment? \n72. CLOSE TWO SHOT \nCOBB \nYour uncle had a weakness for dark ones, tall and stately. How would you like yours? Dark or fair, tall or short, fat or thin, tough or tender? \nLONGFELLOW \nWhat're you talking about? \nCOBB \nWomen! Ever heard of 'em? \nLONGFELLOW \nOh. \nCOBB \nName your poison and I'll supply it. \nLONGFELLOW \nSome other time, Cobb. Some other time. \nCOBB \nOkay, you're the boss. \n(as he goes) \nWhen your blood begins to boil, yell out. I'll be seeing you! \n73. MED. SHOT \nAs Cobb exits. Longfellow turns to Walter, the valet. \nLONGFELLOW \nHe talks about women as if they were cattle. \nWALTER \nEvery man to his taste, sir. \nLONGFELLOW \nTell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true? \nWALTER \nWell, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time. \nLONGFELLOW \nTwenty! What did he do with them? \nWALTER \nThat was something I was never able to find out, sir. \nWIPE OFF TO: \nEXT. CORRIDOR \n74. MED. SHOT \nLongfellow, exiting his bedroom, wearing a coat and hat. He comes to the top of a grand staircase, looks around slyly and sees that no one is watching. He slides down the bannister and touches the statue at the bottom for good luck. \nHe starts for the door. When he gets there he finds his way barred by two husky-looking mugs. He looks up surprised. \nFIRST BODYGUARD \nHey, you going out? \nLONGFELLOW \nWhy yes. Isn't that all right? \n2ND BODYGUARD \nNo. Don't ever want to go out without telling us. \nLONGFELLOW \nWho are you? \nBODYGUARDS \nWe're your bodyguards. \nLONGFELLOW \nOh, yeah. \n2ND BODYGUARD \nYeah, Mr. Cobb said stick to your tail no matter what. \nLONGFELLOW \nThat's very nice of Mr. Cobb - but I don't want anybody sticking to my tail no matter what. \nFIRST BODYGUARD \nSorry, mister. Orders is orders. \nLONGFELLOW \nIs that so? \n2ND BODYGUARD \nYes, sir. We gotta get you up in the morning - and we gotta put you to bed at night. \nFIRST BODYGUARD \nOnly it's all right. No matter what we see - we don't see nuttin', see? \nLONGFELLOW \n(smiling) \nThat's going to be fun. \n2ND BODYGUARD \nSome people like it. \nLongfellow glances around the room thoughtfully, then continues: \nLONGFELLOW \nUh, will you do something for me before we go out? \nFIRST BODYGUARD \nSure! \nThe first bodyguard eagerly takes out a pistol. The second bodyguard slaps it away. \n2ND BODYGUARD \n(to first bodyguard) \nPut that away, slug! \n(to Longfellow) \nAt your service! \nLONGFELLOW \nI got a trunk in that room. Will you get it out for me? \n2ND BODYGUARD \nCertainly. \nFIRST BODYGUARD \nWith pleasure. \nThe two bodyguards accommodatingly enter a closet. The moment they are gone, Longfellow closes the door calmly and turns the key. \nBODYGUARDS \n(ad-lib) \nHey, hey! We're your bodyguards. You can't do this! \nLongfellow whistles as he exits. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. FRONT OF HOUSE \n75. MED. CLOSE SHOT \nWAITER \nUh-huh. \nHe exits. \n86. CLOSE TWO SHOT - BABE AND LONGFELLOW \nBABE \nYou've been having quite an exciting time here, haven't you? All those meetings and business deals and society people - haven't you been having fun? \nLONGFELLOW \nNo. That is, I didn't\u0097 \n(pause - while he looks at her) \nUntil I met you. I like talking to you, though\u0097 \n(moodily) \nImagine my finding you right on my doorstep. \n87. WIDER ANGLE \nThe waiter enters again. \nWAITER \nBrookfield just came in. \nLONGFELLOW \nOh, the poet? Where? \nWAITER \nOver at that big round table. The one that looks like a poodle. \nLongfellow stares off scene - his eyes full of worship. \nLONGFELLOW \n(to Babe) \nLook - there's Brookfield, the poet. \nBABE \n(looks also) \nReally? \n88. MED. SHOT \nFrom their angle, to show people at a table, engaged in conversation. \n89. MED. CLOSE SHOT \nAt Longfellow's table. He stares off at them, awed. Babe watches his face. \n90. MED. SHOT - AUTHOR'S TABLE \nA group of five men, drinking - as the waiter enters. \nWAITER \n(confidentially - indicating Longfellow) \nPardon. Longfellow Deeds, who just inherited the Semple fortune, wants to meet you. \nBROOKFIELD \nOh, yes. I read about him. He writes poetry on postcards. \nHENABERRY \nLet's invite him over. Might get a couple of laughs. Getting rather dull around here. \nMORROW \nIt's always dull here. \nBROOKFIELD \n(rising) \nI'll get him. \nHENABERRY \nGood. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n91. MED.

How do you go about writing your poems? We craftsmen are very interested in one another's methods. \nHENABERRY \nYes. Do you have to wait for an inspiration, or do you just dash it off? \nLONGFELLOW \n(self-consciously) \nWell, I don't know. I\u0097 \nHENABERRY \nMr. Morrow, over there, for instance, just dashes them off. \nMORROW \nYes. That's what my publishers have been complaining about. \nThey all laugh superficially. \n93. CLOSE SHOT GROUP - BABE AND LONGFELLOW \nBabe glances up at Longfellow, to see if he's aware that he is being laughed at. But he apparently isn't. \nLONGFELLOW \n(laughing feebly) \nYour readers don't complain, Mr. Morrow. \nMORROW'S VOICE \nOh, thanks. Thanks. \nBROOKFIELD \nHow about you, Mr. Deeds? \nLONGFELLOW \nWell, I write mine on order. The people I work for just tell me what they want and then I go to work and write it. \nBROOKFIELD \nAmazing! Why, that's true genius! \nHENABERRY \nYes. Have you any peculiar characteristics when you are creating? \nLONGFELLOW \nWell, I play the tuba. \nThey all laugh. \nMORROW \nI've been playing the harmonica for forty years - didn't do me a bit of good. \n94. CLOSE SHOT - GROUP \nBROOKFIELD \nYou wouldn't have one in your pocket, would you, Mr. Deeds? \nLONGFELLOW \n(smiling) \nWhat? A tuba? \nThey all laugh. \nBROOKFIELD \nFeaturing Longfellow. \nLONGFELLOW \n(vaguely) \nThat ought to be fun. \nMORROW \nFun? Say, listen, I'll take you on a bender that will live in your memory as a thing of beauty and joy forever. \n(to someone off) \nBoy! Boy! My headpiece! \nHe exits from the scene. CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM. \nMORROW \n(to the world in general) \nOh, Tempora! Oh, Moeraes!

CLOSEUP - BABE AND LONGFELLOW \nLONGFELLOW \n(to Babe) \nI guess if we go with him, we'll see things, huh? \nShe looks up at his face, amazed at his innocence. \nBABE \nYes, I guess we will. \nFADE OUT: \nINT. MAC'S OFFICE \n106. MED. SHOT \nMac is reading the story, eyes sparkling. Babe is sprawled in a chair, doing tricks with a coin. \nMAC \n(reads) \n\"'I play the tuba to help me think.' This is one of the many startling statements made by Longfellow Deeds - New York's new Cinderella Man - who went out last night to prove that his uncle, the late M.W. Semple - from whom he inherited $20,000,000 - was a rank amateur in the art of 'standing the town on its cauliflower ear' . . . \"[9] \nHe looks up. \nMAC \nCinderella Man! That's sensational, Babe! Sensational! \nBABE \nIt took some high-powered acting, believe me. \nMAC \nDid it? \nBABE \nI was the world's sweetest ingenue. \nMAC \nIs he really that big a sap? \n107. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO \nFavoring Babe. \nBABE \nHe's the original. There are no carbon copies of that one. \nMAC \nCinderella Man! Babe, you stuck a tag on that hick that'll stick to him the rest of his life. Can you imagine Cobb's face when he reads this? \nBABE \nIf we could sell tickets, we'd make a fortune. \nShe covers the coin with palm of other hand, and the coin disappears. But Mac is too excited to pay any attention. \nMAC \nHow'd you get the picture? \nBABE \nHad the boys follow us. \nMAC \nMarvelous! \n(reads again) \n\"At two o'clock this morning, Mr. Deeds tied up traffic while he fed a bagful of doughnuts to a horse. When asked why he was doing it, he replied: 'I just wanted to see how many doughnuts this horse would eat before he'd ask for a cup of coffee.'\" \n(laughs) \nBeautiful! What happened after that? \nBABE \nI don't know. I had to duck to get the story out. He was so far along he never even missed me. \nMAC \nWhen're you going to see him again? \nBABE \nTonight, maybe. \n(looks at her watch) \nI'll phone him at noon. \n(explaining) \nOh, my lunch hour. I'm a stenographer, you know. Mary Dawson. \n108. MED.

Good! Stay there. Don't show your face down here. I'll tell everybody you're on your vacation. They'll never know where the stories are coming from. Stick close to him, Babe - you can get an exclusive story out of him every day for a month. We'll have the other papers crazy. \n(starts for her) \nBabe, I could kiss you! \n109. WIDER ANGLE \nBABE \n(sidestepping) \nOh, no. No. Our deal was for a month's vacation - with pay. \nMAC \nSure. \nBABE \nWith pay! \nShe is out the door. \nMAC \n(yelling after her) \nYou'll get it, Babe. You'll get it. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT.

It's late! \nLONGFELLOW \n(without budging - without opening his eyes) \nYou're Walter, aren't you? \nWALTER \nYes, sir. \nLONGFELLOW \nI just wanted to make sure. \n111. CLOSE SHOT - WALTER \nHe smiles. \nWALTER \nIf you'll permit me to say so, sir, you were out on quite a bender last night, sir. \n112. CLOSE SHOT - LONGFELLOW \nAre those stories true? \n118. CLOSE SHOT - LONGFELLOW AND COBB \nLongfellow has his eyes glued on the paper. \nLONGFELLOW \nI don't remember. \"Cinderella Man!\" What do they mean by that? \nCOBB \nThey'd call you anything if you gave them half a chance. They've got you down as a sap. \nLONGFELLOW \n(calmly) \nI think I'll go down and punch this editor on the nose. \nCOBB \n(quickly) \nNo, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything. \n119. TWO SHOT \nLONGFELLOW \nSometimes it's the only solution. \nCOBB \nNot editors. Take my word for it. Not editors! \nLONGFELLOW \nIf they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going to\u0097 \nCOBB \n(bends over, earnestly) \nListen. Listen, Longfellow. You've got brains, kid. You'll get along swell if you'll only curb your homicidal instincts - and keep your trap shut. Don't talk to anybody! These newshounds are out gunning for you. \nLONGFELLOW \n(referring to paper) \nBut what about this \"Cinderella Man\"? \nCOBB \nThat's my job. I'll take care of that. I'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me. But I can't do anything if you go around talking to people. Will you promise me to be careful from now on? \nLONGFELLOW \nYes, I guess I'll have to. \nCOBB \n(mopping his brow) \nThank you. \n(as he goes) \nIf you feel the building rock, it'll be me blasting into this editor. \n120. MED. SHOT \nHe exits. During the scene Walter has entered with a tray, which he has adjusted on Longfellow's knee. \nLONGFELLOW \nCobb's right. I mustn't talk to anybody. \nBUTLER \n(entering) \nMiss Dawson on the phone, sir. \nLONGFELLOW \n(alertly) \nWho? Miss Dawson? \nBUTLER \nYes, sir. \nLONGFELLOW \nFine. I'll talk to her.

CLOSE SHOT - BABE AND LONGFELLOW \nLongfellow looks around, absorbed. Babe watches him. \nLONGFELLOW \nIt's awfully nice of you to show me around like this. \nBABE \nI enjoy it. \nLONGFELLOW \nThe Aquarium was swell. If I lived in New York, I'd go there every day. I'll bet you do. \nBABE \nWell, I'd like to - but I have a job to think of. \nEXT. STREET \n122. MED. CLOSE SHOT - A TAXI \nDirectly behind the bus. A man's head is stuck out of taxi window.

What's happening about the opera? \nLONGFELLOW \nOh, that - well, we had another meeting. I told them I'd go on being Chairman if\u0097 \n(explaining) \nI'm Chairman, you know. \nBABE \nYes, I know. \nLONGFELLOW \nI told 'em I'd play along with them if they lowered their prices - and cut down expenses - and broadcast. \nBABE \nWhat did they say? \nLONGFELLOW \nGosh, you look pretty tonight. \nBABE \nWhat did they say? \nLONGFELLOW \nHuh? Oh. They said I was crazy. Said I wanted to run it like a grocery store. \nBABE \nWhat are they going to do? \nLONGFELLOW \n(leans over close to her) \nDo you always wear your hair like that? \n125. WIDER SHOT \nAt this point, two girls pass by, chattering. One girl has a paper open. \nFIRST GIRL \nIsn't it a scream - \"Cinderella Man!\" The dope! \n2ND GIRL \n136.

SHOT GROUP \nFIRST BROTHER \nThose people have been in to see me every day this week. \n2ND BROTHER \nWho are they ? \nCEDAR \n(dismissing it) \nRelatives of old man Semple. \nFIRST BROTHER \nThey keep insisting they should have some nuisance value. \nCEDAR \nNuisance value? \nFIRST BROTHER \nThey say if it hadn't been for Deeds, they'd have gotten all the money. \nCEDAR \n(suddenly) \nNuisance value. \n(thinks a minutes - crosses to door) \nMaybe they have! Maybe they have! Maybe they have! \n(opens door) \nMr. and Mrs. Semple, please. How do you do? \nThe others all stand around - as the Semples enter. \nMRS. SEMPLE \nWe've been trying to\u0097 \n138.

The wind blows it back on him. She laughs, takes out a handkerchief and wipes it off his coat. \nBABE \n(as she wipes) \nOh! It's breezy up here. \nHe doesn't say anything right away. \nBABE \nYou're worried about those articles they're writing about you, aren't you? \nLONGFELLOW \nI'm not worrying any more. I suppose they'll go on writing them till they get tired. You don't believe all that stuff, do you? \nA guilty look spreads over Babe's face. \nBABE \nOh, they just do it to sell the newspapers, you know. \nLONGFELLOW \nYeah, I guess so. What puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other. Why don't they try liking each other once in a while? \nAn awkward pause. \nBABE \nShall we go? \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT \n140. MED.

She dabs at it and turning, pauses a moment to watch Babe, who at the moment rests her forehead on the typewriter carriage. \nMABEL \n(softly) \nWhat's the matter, hon? \nBABE \n(quickly) \nNothing. \nBabe is too much absorbed to hear this. Getting no response, Mabel turns and studies her for a few seconds. \nMABEL \nWhat's up, Babe? Something's eating you. \nBABE \nNo. It's nothing. \nMABEL \nMy unfailing instinct tells me something's gone wrong with the stew. \nBABE \n(murmuring) \nDon't be ridiculous. \nShe again resumes her typing. Mabel crosses to her and looks over her shoulder. \nMABEL \nYou haven't gotten very far, have you? That's where you were an hour ago. Come on, let's knock off and go down to Joe's. The gang's waiting for us. \nBABE \n(jumping up) \nI can't write it, Mabel! I don't know what's the matter with me. \nBabe lights a cigarette. Mabel studies her. \nMABEL \n(quietly) \nUh-huh.

Her eyes have a distant look. Mabel watches her, concerned. There is a long pause before either of them speaks. \nMABEL \n(breaking the silence) \nYou're a fool, Babe. \nBABE \nI just couldn't stand seeing him again. \nMABEL \nRunning away is no solution. \n169.

I got a job in China - some place. \nMABEL \nYou're acting like a school girl. \nBABE \n(suddenly - tensely) \nWhat else can I do? Keeping this up is no good. He's bound to find out sometime. \n(softly) \nAt least I can save him that . \nThey are suddenly startled by the boisterous entrance of Bob and Frank, whose voices are heard as they barge in. \n170.

Her sister. Yes, I've been her sister for a long time. \nLONGFELLOW \nIs she home? \nThere is a long pause. Both lost in their own thoughts. \nLONGFELLOW \nDo you mind if I talk to you, Mary? You don't have to pay any attention to me. \nBABE \nNo, I don't mind. \nLONGFELLOW \nAll my life, I've wanted somebody to talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always used to talk to a girl. \nBABE \nA girl? \nLONGFELLOW \nOh, an imaginary one. I used to hike a lot through the woods and I'd always take this girl \nwith me so I could talk to her. I'd show her my pet trees and things. Sounds kind of silly but we had a lot of fun doing it. \n(smiling) \nShe was beautiful. \n(then moodily) \nI haven't married 'cause I've been kinda waiting. You know, my mother and father were a great couple. I thought I might have the same kind of luck. I've always hoped that some day that imaginary girl would turn out to be real. \nThey have arrived back at the front steps of Babe's home. \nLONGFELLOW \nWell, here we are again. \nBABE \nYes, here we are again. \n(after a pause) \nGood night. \nLONGFELLOW \n(then, quickly - his voice faltering) \nMary - I - excuse me\u0097 \n190.

It's to you. \nBABE \n(scarcely audible) \nYes, of course. \nHe now takes the poem out. The paper is folded. He hands it to her and she slowly unfolds it. Just as she is about to read Longfellow lays a hand on her arm. \nLONGFELLOW \n(a little frightened) \nYou don't have to say anything, Mary. You can tell me tomorrow what you think. \nShe looks into his eyes, but does not respond. Then she holds the paper up and begins reading. Longfellow watches her anxiously. \n193. CLOSEUP - BABE \nReading softly: \nBABE \n\"I tramped the earth with hopeless beat - Searching in vain for a glimpse of you.

She does not look up until she refolds the paper. He stands close to her, waiting expectantly. Finally, she glances up. Her cheeks are moist, and her face clouded. Impulsively, she throws her arms around his neck, kissing him. \nBABE \nOh, darling! \nLongfellow's arms encircle her and for a few moments they remain in an emotional embrace. \nLONGFELLOW \n(huskily) \nYou don't have to say anything now. I'll wait till tomorrow - till I hear from you. \n195. CLOSEUP - BABE \nHer eyes are beset with fears. She loves him - but knows how hopeless it all is.

Mac crosses over to her side. \nMAC \nWhat's bothering you, huh? \nBABE \n(after a pause) \nLast night he proposed to me. \nMAC \nProposed to you! You mean he asked you to marry him? \nBABE \nYes. \nMAC \n(alert) \nWhy, Babe - that's terrific! \n(sees it in print) \n\"Cinderella Man Woos Mystery Girl! Who is the Mysterious Girl That\u0097\" \nBABE \nPrint one line of that, and I'll blow your place up! \n198. MED. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO \nMAC \nSorry, Babe. Sorry. It would have made a swell story. I just got carried away. That's too bad. So he proposed to you, huh? \n(intrigued) \nWhat a twist! You set out to nail him - and he\u0097 \nBABE \n(bitterly) \nYeah. Funny twist, isn't it? \nMAC \n(suddenly) \nSay, you haven't gone and fallen for that mug, have you? \nBabe's silence is eloquent. \nMAC \nWell, I'll be\u0097 \nSay something more! \n239. CLOSE SHOT - LONGFELLOW \nHe smiles self-consciously. \n240. MED. CLOSE SHOT OF MEN \nThe spokesman apparently has not finished yet. Directly behind the line, three officious-looking men have made their appearance and wait for him to conclude. \nMAN \nGive me a chance, fellas. We're all down and out - but when a fellow like you comes along, kinda gives us a little hope - and they just wanted me to say\u0097 \nIt's as far as he gets - as the three strangers break their way through the line and approach Longfellow's desk. \nONE OF THE SHERIFFS \n(ad-lib) \nBreak it up. \n241. MED. SHOT AT DESK \nFIRST DEPUTY SHERIFF \n(pointing to Longfellow) \nThat's him. \n2ND DEPUTY SHERIFF \nAre you Longfellow Deeds? \nLONGFELLOW \n(looks up) \nYes? \nFIRST DEPUTY SHERIFF \nSheriff's office. \n(shows paper) \nWe've got a warrant to take you into custody. \nLONGFELLOW \n(without moving) \nA what? \nFIRST DEPUTY SHERIFF \nA warrant for your arrest. You'll have to come along with us. \nCobb enters. \nCOBB \nWhat's up? What do you mugs want? \nFIRST DEPUTY SHERIFF \nI don't know nothing, buddy. All I know is the Sheriff gives me an insanity warrant to execute. \nCOBB \nInsanity! Who's says he's insane? \nThey all turn to Charlie, who comes forward. \nCHARLIE \nThe complainant is a relative of the late Martin Semple. The charges are that Mr. Deeds is insane and incapable of handling the Estate. \nCOBB \nOh, somebody got panic-stricken about his giving his dough away, eh? \n(to sheriff) \nWhere do you think you're going to take him? \nFIRST DEPUTY SHERIFF \nTo the County Hospital. \nCHARLIE \nOf course, that's only temporary. A hearing will follow immediately. \n242. CLOSEUP - LONGFELLOW \nAs he speaks quietly. \nLONGFELLOW \nThat's fine. Just because I want to give this money to people who need it, they think I'm crazy. \n(cynically) \nThat's marvelous. That makes everything complete. \n243. WIDER ANGLE \nTo include group. \nFIRST DEPUTY SHERIFF \nLet's get going! \nCOBB \nWait a minute! Not so fast. We're going to get a lawyer. I'll call Cedar. \nLONGFELLOW \n(thoroughly disillusioned) \nNo, don't bother. \nCHARLIE \nAs a matter of fact, I'm from Mr. Cedar's office. He represents the complainant. \nCOBB \nOh. \nLongfellow glances up at him and smiles bitterly. \nFIRST DEPUTY SHERIFF \nWell, let's go. We're wasting a lot of time. \nHe goes to one side of Longfellow, and his partner to the other. They take Longfellow by the arms. He glances down casually and, suddenly, violently pushes the deputies away from him. They are thrown backward; their eyes widen in surprise. \nLONGFELLOW \n(calmly rising) \nAll right, I'll go. But get your hands off me! \n244. MEDIUM SHOT \nLongfellow starts to walk forward, accompanied by Cobb - and the two deputies and Charlie fall in behind them. \nTHE SHERIFFS \n(ad-lib) \nMake way! Make way! \n245. CLOSE SHOTS OF CLERKS \nTo be intercut with above scene. They stare, petrified, and mumble to each other. \n246. MEDIUM SHOT \nOf the farmers and other applicants. The line has fallen out and they stand in a bunch, staring pathetically and hopelessly at the departing group. \n247. CLOSEUP OF THE FARMER \nWho stands in f.g. of bunch. What is taking place has slowly penetrated his befuddled brain. The disappointment he feared is here. His body imperceptibly sags, his eyes dim - all hope having gone out of them. \nFADE OUT: \nFADE IN \nINSERT: SIGN reading: \"COUNTY HOSPITAL\" \nDISSOLVE THRU TO: \nINT. CORRIDOR OF HOSPITAL \n248. MEDIUM SHOT \nA guard sits at a desk near a door, talking on the telephone. \nGUARD \n(on phone) \nYes, most everybody in town has been here to see him. Yes, sir. I won't. Goodbye\u0097 \nBabe rounds the corner quickly, heading for the door. The guard hurriedly hangs up and stands to block her. \nGUARD \nSorry, lady\u0097 \n(recognizes her) \nOh, it's you again. \nBABE \nOh, please! I've got to see him. \nGUARD \nNow listen, sister, for the fourteenth and last time he don't want to see nobody. \nBABE \n(pleading) \nWill you just give him my name? \nGUARD \n(confidentially) \nListen, toots, just between us, there ain't a thing in the world the matter with that guy till I mention your name, then he goes haywire! \nBabe winces under the blow. \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM \n249. MEDIUM SHOT \nLongfellow is seated by the far wall, peering moodily out the window. Cobb paces about. Suddenly, he wheels on Longfellow. \nCOBB \n269. PANNING SHOT OF SPECTATORS \nCEDAR'S VOICE \nI have before me a series of articles written by a newspaper woman who was an eye-witness to his conduct ever since he came to New York. \nCAMERA STOPS on Babe and Mac. Cedar's voice goes on: \nCEDAR \nShe tells how, in the midst of a normal conversation, he would suddenly begin playing his tuba. She tells of his attacks upon several of our eminent writers - for no apparent reason. In fact, there are many instances not recorded in these articles in which Mr. Deeds satisfied an unnatural desire to smash people up without provocation. \n270. MED. SHOT - FRONT OF COURTROOM \nCEDAR \nI, myself, unable to keep pace with his mental quirks, and constantly fearful of assault, turned down an opportunity to represent him as his attorney. This newspaper woman, whom we have subpoenaed to testify, tells how he tied up traffic for an hour feeding doughnuts to a poor horse. And by his own statement, waiting for that horse to ask for a cup of coffee. \nThere is laughter in the courtroom - which quickly subsides when the Judge pounds his gavel. \nCEDAR \nWe have photographs to substantiate this little episode, and other photographs showing Mr. Deeds jumping upon a fire engine. This scarcely sounds like the action of a man in whom the disposition of twenty million dollars may safely be entrusted. This writer of these articles - a woman whose intelligence and integrity in the newspaper world is unquestioned - held him in such contempt that she quite aptly named him \"The Cinderella Man.\" \n271. CLOSEUP - LONGFELLOW \nCEDAR'S VOICE \nWe have witnesses here from Mandrake Falls, his own home town, who will tell of his conduct throughout his lifetime, proving that his derangement is neither recent nor a temporary one. \nLongfellow's interest is only slightly aroused. He lifts his eyes in a casual glance around him. \n272. MED. CLOSE SHOT \nFeaturing Cedar. \nCEDAR \nWe have others who will tell of his unusual behavior when he invited the great leaders of the musical world to his home, and then proceeded to forcibly eject them. Only recently when he was in the County Hospital for observation, he not only refused to be examined by these gentlemen, the state psychiatrists, but he actually made a violent attack upon them. \n273. CLOSE SHOT - THE JUDGE \nAs Cedar continues talking, CAMERA PULLS BACK to WIDER SHOT. \nCEDAR \nIn these times, with the country incapacitated by economic ailments, and endangered with an undercurrent of social unrest, the promulgation of such a weird, fantastic and impractical plan as contemplated by the defendant, is capable of fomenting a disturbance from which the country may not soon recover. It is our duty to stop it! Our government is fully aware of its difficulties and can pull itself out of its economic rut without the assistance of Mr. Deeds, or any other crackpot. \n274. MED. PANNING SHOT \nOf farmers, the Swede and others. \nCEDAR'S VOICE \nHis attempted action must therefore be attributed to a diseased mind afflicted with hallucinations of grandeur, and obsessed with an insane desire to become a public benefactor. \n275. CLOSE SHOT AT FRONT OF COURTROOM \nFeaturing Cedar. \nCEDAR \n(suddenly) \nYour Honor, at this time, we would like to call our first witness: Miss Louise - Babe - Bennett. \n276. FULL SHOT \nThere is a mild stir, and all wait expectantly for Babe to appear. \nCLERK \nMiss Bennett, please. \nBabe, eyes on Longfellow, slowly walks to the stand. \n277. CLOSEUP - LONGFELLOW \nHe has his face averted and doesn't look at her. \n278. MEDIUM SHOT \nBabe continues to rivet her eyes on Longfellow, as she is sworn in. \nCLERK \nRaise your right hand, please. \nShe does so. \nCLERK \nDo you solemnly swear the testimony you may give before this court to be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? \nBABE \nI do. \nCLERK \nState your right name, please. \nBABE \nLouise Bennett. \nCLERK \nTake the stand. \n279. MED. CLOSE SHOT AT WITNESS STAND \nAs Cedar steps up to question Babe. Judge in f.g. \nCEDAR \nMiss Bennett, are you employed by the Morning Mail? \nThere is no answer. Babe continues to stare off at Longfellow, hoping he will look up. Cedar speaks to her again: \nCEDAR \nI must ask you to direct your attention to me. \nBut Babe's attention remains focused on Longfellow. \nBABE \n(appealing to Judge) \nYour Honor, this is ridiculous! \nJUDGE \nPlease answer the questions. \nBABE \n(wildly) \nThe whole hearing's ridiculous! That man's no more insane than you are. \nThe suddenness of her outbreak is startling. The Judge pounds his gavel. \n280. WIDER ANGLE - FRONT OF COURTROOM \nThe Judge pounding his gavel. \nJUDGE \nMiss Bennett please! \nCEDAR \nThis is outrageous! \nBABE \n(rising to stand) \nIt's obviously a frameup! They're trying to railroad this man for the money they can get out of him! \nCEDAR \nYour Honor! \nThe Judge pounds his gavel throughout her speech. \nJUDGE \n(highly) \nYoung lady, another outburst like that and I shall hold you in contempt! We're not interested in your opinion of the merits of this case. You're here to testify. Sit down and answer the questions. Proceed. \nCedar beams victoriously. \nCEDAR \nThank you, Your Honor. Are you employed by the Morning Mail? \nBABE \n(sharply) \nNo! \nCedar's eyes widen in surprise. There is a light stir. \nCEDAR \n(threateningly) \nYou are under oath, Miss Bennett. I ask you again - are you employed by the Morning Mail? \nBABE \n(irritably) \nNo! I resigned last week! \n281. CLOSE SHOT - LONGFELLOW \nAs Cedar proceeds without interruption. \nCEDAR'S VOICE \nWell, prior to that time - were you employed by the Morning Mail? \nBABE'S VOICE \n(laconically) \nYes. \n282. CLOSE SHOT AT WITNESS STAND - BABE AND CEDAR \nCEDAR \nWere you given an assignment to follow the activities of Longfellow Deeds? \nBABE \nYes. \nCEDAR \nDid you subsequently write a series of articles about him? \nSince he was born. \nAMY \nYes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife. \nJANE \nHe was a seven-months baby. \nCEDAR \nThank you, that's fine. Do you see him very often? \nThe two old ladies have their whispered conference again. \nJANE \nMost every day. \nAMY \nSometimes twice. \nJUDGE \n(irascibly) \nMust we have the echo? \nCEDAR \nSuppose you just answer, Miss Jane. Now, will you tell the Court what everybody at home thinks of Longfellow Deeds? \nThe two old ladies consult each other once more. \nJANE \nThey think he's pixilated. \nAMY \nOh yes, pixilated. \nJUDGE \n(leaning forward) \nHe's what? \nCEDAR \n(concerned) \nWhat was that you said he was? \nJANE \nPixilated. \nAMY \nUh-huh. \nCEDAR \n(patiently) \nNow, that's a rather strange word to use, Miss Jane. Can you tell the court exactly what it means? \nWhile the two ladies go into a huddle: \n293. CLOSE SHOT - PSYCHIATRISTS \nAs one of them speaks up. \nPSYCHIATRIST \nPerhaps I can explain, Your Honor. The word pixilated is an early American expression - derived from the word 'pixies,' meaning elves. They would say, 'The pixies had got him,' as we nowadays would say a man is 'balmy.' \n294. MEDIUM SHOT \nThe Judge nods his understanding. The Falkner sisters nod in pleasant agreement. Cedar sighs victoriously. \nCEDAR \nIs that correct? \nJANE \nUh-huh. \nAMY \nUh-huh. \nJUDGE \nNow tell me, why does everyone think he's - uh - pixilated? Does he do peculiar things? \n295. MED. SHOT TOWARD WITNESS STAND \nJANE \n(after conferring with Amy) \nHe walks in the rain, without his hat, and talks to himself. \nAMY \nSometimes he whistles. \nJANE \nAnd sings. \nCEDAR \nAnything else? \nJANE \nRecently he gave Chuck Dillon a thumping. \nAMY \nBlacked his eye. \nCEDAR \nAnd why? \nJANE \nFor no reason, I guess. He always does it. We always run into the house when we see him coming. \nAMY \nNever can tell what he's going to do. \nJANE \nHe sure is pixilated. \nAMY \nOh, yes - he's pixilated all right. \nCEDAR \nThank you, ladies. That's all. \nCedar beams. The old ladies leave to resume their seats. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n296. CLOSE SHOT IN WITNESS STAND \nA policeman in uniform. \nPOLICEMAN \nThey kept hollering: \"Back to Nature! Back to Nature!\" I thought they looked harmless enough so I took them home. I never thought he was cracked. \nWIPE OFF TO: \n297. CLOSE SHOT IN WITNESS STAND \nThe waiter at \"Tullio's.\" \nWAITER \nI'm a waiter. He kept pressing me to point out the celebrities, and so help me Hannah I'm coming out of the kitchen a coupla minutes later and there he is moppin' up the floors with them. I never figured he was a guy looking for trouble. \nWIPE OFF TO: \n298. CLOSE SHOT IN WITNESS STAND \nMme. Pomponi. \nMME. POMPONI \n(expostulating) \nHe threw us out bodily! But bodily! \nWIPE OFF TO: \n299. MED. CLOSE SHOT IN WITNESS STAND \nOf one of the bodyguards on witness stand. \nBODYGUARD \nWe was hired as his bodyguard, see? Well, the first crack out of the box, he throws us in a room and locks the door, see? Now, if a thing like that gets around in our profession, we'd get the bird - see? So I says to my partner, \"Let's quit this guy, he's nuts!\" \nWIPE OFF TO: \n300. CLOSE SHOT IN WITNESS STAND \nA Cockney cabman. \nCABMAN \nI'm very fond of Clara, sir. She's a nice 'orse. And when this bloke 'ere started feedin' 'er doughnuts, I yelled down to him, \"Mind what you're doin' down there! Mind what you're doing'!\" Of course I wouldn't mind, sir, but Clara won't eat nothin' but doughnuts, now. \nWIPE OFF TO: \n301. WIDE SHOT[13] \nOf one of the photographers (Bob) and enlarged photographs of Longfellow's antics. \nBAILIFF'S VOICE \nCome to order. \nCEDAR \nYour Honor, I wish to call your attention to these exhibits. Mr. Davis, do you recognize these reproductions? \nBOB \nSure, they're good enlargements. Where'd you have them made? \nCEDAR \nDid you make the originals of them? \nYou both concur? \nEXPERTS \n(ad-lib) \nOh, positively. \nThe Judge emerges from his consultation with his experts and addresses Longfellow. \nJUDGE \nMr. Deeds, in view of the extensive testimony and your continued silence and upon recommendation of the doctors, the Court considers it advisable for your own safety that you be committed to an institution as prescribed by law. You need medical attention, Mr. Deeds. \n(shrugs) \nPerhaps in a little while\u0097 \nSuddenly the air is rent with the shrill voice of Babe. \nBABE \nNo! No! No! Wait a minute! \nAll are startled and look up. Babe runs right to the Judge. \nBABE \nYou can't do it! You've got to make him talk. \nCEDAR'S VOICE \nYour Honor, I object! \nShe turns directly to Longfellow - leaning over close to him. \n315. CLOSE SHOT - BABE AND LONGFELLOW \nBABE \n(pleading softly) \nOh, darling, please. I know everything I've done. I know how horrible I've been. No matter what happens, if you never see me again, do this for me. \nJUDGE'S VOICE \nMiss Bennett, please! \nBABE \n(frantically) \nYou said I could speak! You said I could have my say if I were rational. I'm rational. Please, let me take the witness chair. \n316. WIDER ANGLE \nBABE \nHe must be made to defend himself before you arrive at a decision. \nJUDGE \nVery well. Take the stand. \nBabe goes up to the witness stand and sits down. \nBABE \nOh, thank you! \nCEDAR \n(shouting) \nYour Honor, what she is saying has no bearing on the case. I object. \nJUDGE \nLet her speak. \nBABE \nI know why he won't defend himself! That has a bearing on the case, hasn't it? He's been hurt! He's been hurt by everybody's he met since he came here, principally by me. He's been the victim of every conniving crook in town. The newspapers pounced on him - made him a target for their feeble humor. \n317. CLOSE SHOT - BABE \nBABE \nI was smarter than the rest of them! I got closer to him so I could laugh louder. Why shouldn't he keep quiet? Every time he said anything it was twisted around to sound imbecilic. \n318. CLOSEUP - BABE \nAs she continues. \nBABE \nHe can thank me for it! I handed the gang a grand laugh. This is a fitting climax to my sense of humor. \n319. WIDER ANGLE \nAs Cedar protests. \nCEDAR \nBut Your Honor - this is preposterous! \nThe Judge waves him down with a dismissing gesture of his hand. \nBABE \nCertainly I wrote those articles. I was going to get a raise - and a month's vacation! But I stopped writing them when I found out what he was all about! When I realized how real he was. \n320. CLOSE SHOT - LONGFELLOW \nAs Babe's voice continues: \nBABE'S VOICE \nHe could never fit in with our distorted viewpoint because he's honest and sincere - and good. If that man is crazy, Your Honor, the rest of us belong in straight-jackets. \n321. MED. SHOT \nCedar jumps up. \nCEDAR \nYour Honor, this is absurd. The woman's obviously in love with him. \nBABE \nWhat's that got to do with it? \nCEDAR \n(shouting) \nWell, you are in love with him, aren't you? \nBABE \n(shouting back) \nWhat's that got to do with it? \nCEDAR \n(louder) \nYou are , aren't you? \nBABE \n(just as loud) \nYes!!! \n322. CLOSEUP - LONGFELLOW \nTo be intercut during her speech. At first he merely glances up at her speculatively. Finally, he begins to show some interest. \n323. MED. SHOT FRONT OF COURTROOM \nCedar turns to the Judge. \nCEDAR \nYour Honor, her testimony is of no value. Why shouldn't she defend him? It's a tribute to American womanhood - the instinct to protect the weak. I'm not saying that nobody likes the boy. I cherish a fond affection for him myself. But that doesn't mean to say\u0097 \nIn the middle of his speech, Mac - the editor - appears at his elbow. \nMAC \nWhen the windbag here gets through, Your Honor, I'd like to verify what Miss Bennett said. I'm her editor. When she quit her job, she told me what a swell fellow this man was. And anything Babe Bennett says is okay with me. \nJUDGE \nIf you have anything to say, you will take the stand. \nMAC \nI've already said it, Your Honor. I just thought I'd like to get my two cents in. \nAs he starts to go, CAMERA PANNING WITH HIM, he passes Longfellow. He nudges him. \nMAC \nDon't be a sucker, pal. Stand up and speak your piece. \nHe disappears to his seat. \nCOBB \nYour Honor, I've got a couple of cents I'd like to put in\u0097 \nJUDGE \nSit down! \nCOBB \nI've been with this man ever since he came to New York\u0097 \n324. MED. SHOT \nShooting toward the Judge. He pounds his gavel, interrupting Cobb. \nJUDGE \nSit down! There will be no further interruptions. \nAlmost simultaneously with the Judge's speech, the farmer, somewhere in the audience, rises to his feet. \nFARMER \nHow about us, Mr. Deeds! \n325. MED. SHOT \nShooting toward audience. As the farmer finishes, a dozen others are on their feet. \nCROWD \n(ad-lib) \nYes! What about us, Mr. Deeds! \nYou're not going to leave us out in the cold! \n", "test1_input": "202. FULL SHOT \nLongfellow enters. \nLONGFELLOW \n(yelling) \nWalter! Walter! Walter, where are you? \nWalter enters, panic-stricken. \nWALTER \nYes, sir. What is it, sir? Anything happened3 \n203. MED. CLOSE SHOT \nLONGFELLOW \nAnything happened? I've got to get dressed! I can't meet her like this! \nWALTER \nBut she isn't due for an hour, sir. \nLONGFELLOW \nAn hour? What's an hour! You know how time flies, Walter. My tie? Get it. \nWALTER \nYes, sir. Very good, sir. Here it is right here, sir. There, sir. \nWhile putting it on, he sings \"Humoresque\" loudly and gaily. \n204. MEDIUM SHOT \nAt this moment, Cobb bursts in - his face grim: \nCOBB \nJust as I suspected, wise guy! I don't mind you making a sap out of yourself - but you made one out of me, too. \nLONGFELLOW \n(to Walter - merrily) \nWill you tell the gentleman I'm not in? \nCOBB \nMary Dawson, huh? Mary Dawson, my eye. That dame took you for a sleigh ride that New York will laugh about for years. She's the slickest, two-timing, double-crossing\u0097 \nAt the mention of the name, Longfellow turns for the first time. \n205. CLOSEUP - LONGFELLOW \nHis face goes livid, as Cobb's voice continues: \nLONGFELLOW \n(between clenched teeth) \nWhat are you talking about? \n206. MEDIUM SHOT \nLongfellow has started out toward him. In two long strides, Longfellow has grabbed Cobb by the shirt-front, ready to strangle him. \nCOBB \nAll right. Go ahead. Sock away, and then try to laugh this off. \nWith his free hand, he reaches into his coat pocket. He unrolls a newspaper. Longfellow shifts his glance over to the photograph in the newspaper Cobb holds up, and slowly his grip on Cobb relaxes. He takes the newspaper. \n207. CLOSEUP - LONGFELLOW \nAs he looks at the picture. \nINSERT: PICTURE OF BABE BENNETT \nUnder which is the following: \n\"Louise (Babe) Bennett - wins Pulitzer Prize for reportorial job on Macklyn love triange.\" \nBACK TO SCENE \nLongfellow stares long and unbelievingly at the picture. \n208. MED. CLOSE SHOT - COBB AND LONGFELLOW \nCOBB \n(adjusting his clothes) \nShe's the star reporter on The Mail. Every time you opened your kisser, you gave her another story. She's the dame who slapped that monicker on you - \"Cinderella Man.\" You've been making love to a double dose of cyanide! \nLONGFELLOW \n(an outcry) \nShut up! \nLongfellow, stunned, crosses to the bed - CAMERA PANNING WITH HIM. He slumps down and continues staring at picture. \n209. MEDIUM SHOT \nCobb crosses to phone and picks up receiver. \nCUT TO: \nINT. NEWSPAPER OUTER OFFICE \n210. MED. CLOSE SHOT \nBabe is at her desk. She has just finished rummaging through her desk. Many articles are on top. Mac is by her side. Babe flicks the pages of a small loose-leaf book, and hands it to Mac. \nBABE \nThis is for you , Mac. The names of all the headwaiters in town. You can always buy a bit of choice scandal from them at reasonable prices. \nMAC \nAw, listen Babe, I can't let you quit now. You're not going through with this thing, are you? \nBabe shakes her head with finality, as the phone bell rings. \nMAC \n(picking up receiver) \nI've seen 'em get in a rut like you before - but they always come back. \n(into phone) \nHello . . . Yes. Just a minute. \nHe holds the receiver out to her. \nMAC \nIt's for you. In a couple weeks you'll get the itch so bad, you'll be working for nothing. \nBABE \n(into phone) \nHello . . . \nINT. LONGFELLOW'S BEDROOM \n211. MEDIUM SHOT \nCobb is at the phone. \nCOBB \nBabe Bennett? Just a minute. \nHe listens and hands phone to Longfellow. \nLONGFELLOW \n(into phone) \nHello, Mary? \nINT.

His face is a dead mask, every illusion shattered. Slowly, a wry smile appears on his face and, rising, he wanders around the room in deep abstraction. Cobb and Walter watch him sympathetically. \nLongfellow is silent a long time. \n216. MEDIUM SHOT \nAs a butler enters. \nBUTLER \nI beg pardon, sir. Shall I serve the wine with the squab, sir? \n", "test1_true": "BUTLER \n(tries again) \nI beg pardon, sir. \n217. CLOSEUP - COBB \nHis face softens. \nCOBB \nIf I knew you were going to take it so hard, I woulda kept my mouth shut. Sorry. \n218. MEDIUM SHOT \nAs finally Longfellow speaks, without turning. \nLONGFELLOW \n(quietly) \nPack my things, Walter. I'm going home. \nWALTER \nYes, sir. \nHe immediately busies himself. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. CORRIDOR \n219. WIDE SHOT \nLongfellow emerges from his bedroom, walking briskly toward the staircase, immediately followed by Cobb and Walter. Walter is loaded down with suitcases. Longfellow is wearing coat and hat. \nCOBB \n(trying to keep up with Longfellow) \nYou shouldn't be running away like this. What's going to happen to the Estate? \nLONGFELLOW \nThey can have the Estate. \nAs they approach the staircase, a commotion is heard from stairs. Cobb hurries ahead to see what is going on. \nINT. GRAND FOYER \n220. MEDIUM SHOT \nTwo butlers are struggling with a wild-eyed man of middle age. They shout in unison. \nBUTLERS \n(simultaneously) \nFARMER \nYou can't come up here! \nLet me go!

Get a kick out of it, huh? Got a big laugh? \n(sarcastically) \nDid you ever think of feeding doughnuts to human beings! No! \nLongfellow stares at him. \nWALTER \n(quietly) \nShall I call the police, sir? \nLONGFELLOW \nNo! \n(to man) \nWhat do you want!! \nFARMER \nYeah - that's all that's worrying you.

I wouldn't believe you or anybody else on a stack of bibles! You're a moocher like all the rest of them around here, so get out of here! \nFARMER \nSure - everybody's a moocher to you.

You're about to get on the front page again! See how you're going to like it this time! \n(voice rises) \nSee what good your money's going to do when you're six feet under ground.

Longfellow never moves. \nFARMER \n(dead voice - staring into space) \nI'm glad I didn't hurt nobody.

Never mind, Cobb. \nHe takes it, and he and the Swede silently eat. Longfellow looks up. \nLONGFELLOW \nGood. \nThe Swede smiles. Longfellow nibbles his sandwich, then glances around the room.

Several women giggle. The Judge sternly pounds his gavel. \n343. CLOSE SHOT - LONGFELLOW \nLONGFELLOW \nIt's likely to happen to anybody. Just the other morning I read in the paper about Mr. Cedar's own son - about how he got drunk and insisted on driving a taxi-cab, while the driver sat inside. Isn't that so, Mr. Cedar? Isn't that so , Mr. Cedar? \n344. MED. SHOT OF COURTROOM \nAll eyes have turned to Cedar. \n345. CLOSE SHOT - CEDAR \nHis eyes are beginning to blaze angrily. \nCEDAR \nYour Honor, I object. \nJUDGE \nProceed. \n346. MEDIUM SHOT \nLONGFELLOW \nNow about the Falkner sisters. That's kind of funny. I mean about Mr. Cedar going all the way to Mandrake Falls to bring them here. Do you mind if I talk to them? \nJUDGE \nNot at all. \nLongfellow turns. Everybody stretches to get a better look at them. \nLONGFELLOW \nJane, who owns the house you live in? \n347. CLOSE SHOT - THE SISTERS \nThe girls consult with each other. \nJANE \nWhy, you own it, Longfellow. \nAMY \nYes, you own it. \nLONGFELLOW'S VOICE \nDo you pay any rent? \nJANE \n(after conferring with Amy) \nNo, we don't pay any rent. \nAMY \nGood heavens, no!

Do you still think so? \nJANE \n(after the usual conference) \nWhy, you've always been pixilated, Longfellow. \nAMY \nAlways. \nLONGFELLOW \n(smiling) \nThat's fine. I guess maybe I am. \n(seriously) \nNow tell me something, Jane. Who else in Mandrake Falls is pixilated? \nJane turns to her sister and this time they go into a prolonged huddle.

SHOT - FRONT OF COURTROOM \nJUDGE \nMr. Deeds, you haven't yet touched upon a most important thing. This rather fantastic idea of yours to want to give away your entire fortune. It is, to say the least, most uncommon. \nLONGFELLOW \nOh yes, I was getting to that, Your Honor. \nCAMERA MOVES TO CLOSER SHOT, featuring Longfellow and Judge, as former continues: \nLONGFELLOW \nSuppose you were living in a small town and getting along fine, and suddenly somebody dropped $20,000,000 in your lap. Supposing you discovered that all that money was messing up your life, was bringing a lot of vultures around your neck, and making you lose faith in everybody. You'd be a little worried, wouldn't you? You'd feel that you had a hot potato in your hand, and you'd want to drop it. I guess Dr. Von Holler would say you were riding on\u0097 \n(points to chart) \n\u0097those bottom waves, 'cause you wanted to drop something that was burning your fingers. \n354. MEDIUM SHOT \nCedar springs to his feet. \nCEDAR \n(shouting) \nIf this man is permitted to carry out his plan, repercussions will be felt that will rock the foundations of our entire governmental system! \nThe Judge has pounded him into silence. \nJUDGE \nPlease, Mr. Cedar! \n(to Longfellow) \nProceed. \n355. MED. CLOSE SHOT AT WITNESS STAND \nLONGFELLOW \nPersonally, I don't know what Mr. Cedar's raving about. From what I can see, no matter what system of government we have, there will always be leaders and always be followers. \n356. MED. CLOSE SHOT \nFarmers in audience, as Longfellow's voice continues: \nLONGFELLOW'S VOICE \nIt's like the road out in front of my house. It's on a steep hill. Every day I watch the cars climbing up. Some go lickety-split up that hill on high\u0097 \n357. FULL SHOT \nLONGFELLOW \n\u0097some have to shift into second - and some sputter and shake and slip back to the bottom again. Same cars - same gasoline - yet some make it and some don't. And I say the fellows who can make the hill on high should stop once in a while and help those who can't. \n358. MEDIUM SHOT \nLONGFELLOW \n(making his point) \nThat's all I'm trying to do with this money. Help the fellows who can't make the hill on high. \n359.

They're the ones I'm trying to help. They need it! \n(pointing) \nMr. Cedar and that Mr. Semple don't need anything. They've got plenty! It's like I'm out in a big boat and I see one fellow in a rowboat who's tired of rowing and wants a free ride - and another fellow who's drowning. Who would you expect me to rescue? Mr. Cedar, who just got tired of rowing and wants a free ride? Or those men out there who are drowning? Any ten-year-old child will give you the answer to that. \n(to farmers etc. in courtroom) \nAll right, fellows. Thank you. Sit down. \n362. MEDIUM SHOT - FRONT OF COURTROOM \nLONGFELLOW \nNow, my plan is very simple. I was going to give each family ten acres - a horse, a cow and some seed. And if they work the farm for three years, it's theirs. Now, if that's crazy, maybe I ought to be sent to an institution. But I don't think it is. And what's more, Mr. Cedar doesn't either. \n(vehemently) \nJust before the hearing started, he offered to call the whole thing off if I made a settlement with him. So you see, he wouldn't think I was crazy if he got paid off. \n363. CLOSE SHOT - CEDAR \nHe jumps to his feet, highly incensed. \nCEDAR \nIt's a lie! \nJUDGE \nMr. Cedar! \nCEDAR \nMr. Deeds is drawing on his warped imagination! \n364. CLOSE SHOT - LONGFELLOW \nAs he listens to Cedar, watching him antagonistically. \nCEDAR'S VOICE \nI've never heard anything so colossally stupid in my life! \nLongfellow's eyes narrow resentfully. \n365. WIDER ANGLE \nTo include Longfellow, Cedar and Judge. \nCEDAR \nIt's an insult to our intelligence to sit here and listen to his childish ravings. \nThroughout his speech the Judge has been pounding his gavel. Longfellow has his eyes levelled off on Cedar. \nJUDGE \n(when quiet reigns) \nYou will please permit Mr. Deeds to finish. \nCEDAR \nBut Your Honor\u0097 \nJUDGE \nMr. Cedar! \nCedar, grumblingly, remains standing. Judge asks Longfellow: \nJUDGE \nAnything else, Mr. Deeds? \nLONGFELLOW \n(eyes still on Cedar) \nNo. \n(changes his mind; turns to Judge) \nYes. There's just one more thing I'd like to get off my chest before I finish. \nJUDGE \nProceed. \nLONGFELLOW \nThank you, Your Honor. \nHe rises to his feet, takes one step forward, and clouts Cedar flush on the jaw. As Cedar falls into the arms of an associate, pandemonium breaks loose. \nBAILIFF'S VOICE \nOrder! Order! Order in the court! \n366. FULL SHOT OF COURTROOM \nThe Judge pounds his gavel.

FULL SHOT - COURTROOM \nAll eyes are upon the Judge, who clears his throat. \nJUDGE \n(serious mien) \nMr. Deeds, there has been a great deal of damaging testimony against you. Your behavior, to say the least, has been most strange. \nAn audible gasp is heard from audience. Judge goes on: \nJUDGE \nBut in the opinion of the Court, you are not only sane, but you are the sanest man that ever walked into this courtroom. Case dismissed! \nThe shout that greets this is tumultuous. The Judge smiles warmly, and clasps Longfellow's hand. Immediately, Longfellow is surrounded by a crowd of people who come running down the aisles. \n377. CLOSE SHOT - CEDAR AND GROUP \nThey sit, stunned, disappointed. Mrs. Semple turns to her husband and slaps him. \nMRS. SEMPLE \nYou nose-twitcher! \nBudington rises to confront Cedar. \nBUDINGTON \nOh, I knew it! I knew it!

Back home we never get a chance to meet famous people. \nBILL \n(calling waiter) \nWaiter! A little service here. \nTHE GROUP \n(ad-lib) \nYes! \nMr. Deeds is a distinguished poet. \nA drink for Mr. Deeds! \nHENABERRY \nHe's a poet. Have a drink. \nLONGFELLOW \nNo - I don't want it, thank you. \nHENABERRY \nWhy, you must drink! All poets drink! \n92. MED. CLOSE SHOT - THE GROUP \nBILL \nTell us, Mr. Deeds. How do you go about writing your poems? We craftsmen are very interested in one another's methods. \nHENABERRY \nYes. Do you have to wait for an inspiration, or do you just dash it off? \nLONGFELLOW \n(self-consciously) \nWell, I don't know. I\u0097 \nHENABERRY \nMr. Morrow, over there, for instance, just dashes them off. \nMORROW \nYes. That's what my publishers have been complaining about. \nThey all laugh superficially. \n93.

Thanks. \nBROOKFIELD \nHow about you, Mr. Deeds? \nLONGFELLOW \nWell, I write mine on order. The people I work for just tell me what they want and then I go to work and write it. \nBROOKFIELD \nAmazing! Why, that's true genius! \nHENABERRY \nYes. Have you any peculiar characteristics when you are creating? \nLONGFELLOW \nWell, I play the tuba. \nThey all laugh. \nMORROW \nI've been playing the harmonica for forty years - didn't do me a bit of good. \n94.

Longfellow has his eyes levelled on each speaker in turn, obviously cognizant of their ill-concealed jibes. \nHENABERRY \nWait a minute, boys. Perhaps Mr. Deeds would recite one for us. \nTHE OTHER'S VOICES \n(ad-lib) \nYes! \nBROOKFIELD \nThat's a very good idea. Nothing like a poet reciting his own stuff. \nONE OF THE OTHERS \nHow about a Mother's Day poem, Mr. Deeds? \nHENABERRY \nExactly! Give us one that wrings the great American heart. \nTHE GROUP \n(ad-lib) \nYes. \nBabe has been watching Longfellow, interested.

What about it? \nHenaberry's face sobers. \nLONGFELLOW \n(simply) \nIt's easy to make fun of somebody if you don't care how much you hurt 'em. \n(to Brookfield) \nI think your poems are swell, Mr. Brookfield, but I'm disappointed in you. I know I must look funny to you, but maybe if you went to Mandrake Falls you'd look just as funny to us . Only nobody would laugh at you and make you feel ridiculous - 'cause that wouldn't be good manners. \n97. CLOSE SHOT - LONGFELLOW \nAs he rises, continuing: \nLONGFELLOW \nI guess maybe it is comical to write poems for postcards, but a lot of people think they're good. Anyway, it's the best I can do. So if you'll excuse me, we'll be leaving. I guess I found out that all famous people - aren't big people . . . \n98. MED.

Longfellow and Babe turn. \nMORROW \n(obviously groggy with drink) \nSay fellow, you neglected me - and I feel very put out. \n(points to his chin) \nLook, sock it right there, will you? Lay one right on the button,[6] but sock it hard. \n102. CLOSE SHOT - THE THREE \nLONGFELLOW \nThat's all right. I got it off my chest. \nMORROW \nThe difference between them and me is I know when I've been a skunk. You take me to the nearest news-stand and I'll eat a pack of your postcards raw. Raw! \nLongfellow and Babe smile. As Morrow continues to speak, he sways drunkenly and would fall over backwards a couple of times in midsentence if the alert Longfellow didn't have a clutch on his collar. \nMORROW \nOh, what a magnificent deflation of smugness. Pal, you've added ten years to my life! A poet with a straight left and a right hook - delicious! Delicious! You're my guest from now on - forever and a day - even unto eternity! \nLONGFELLOW \nThanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights. \nMORROW \nFine, fine.

Pal, how would you like to go on a real, old-fashioned binge? \nLONGFELLOW \n(puzzled) \nBinge? \nMORROW \nYes. I mean the real McCoy. Listen, you play saloon with me, and I'll introduce you to every wit, every nit-wit, and every half-wit in New York.

{"train": "CASE 39 \nWritten by \nRay Wright \nINSPIRED BY REAL EVENTS \nPitch black. We hear FOOTSTEPS sneaking up an old wooden staircase. Two people moving as one. \nTopping the stairs, they creep down the hall to the closed door that protects us. We can hear them behind it, whispering, bickering insanely, one shushing the other. \nThe squeak of a door knob slowly turning. The faint click of the latch. And the door inches open, throwing a razor-thin shaft of light into the darkness where it illuminates a \nFRIGHTENED EYE \nAs a ten-year-old GIRL sits up in bed. Dead tired. Staring at the two dark faces peering in at her. \nGIRL I can see you... \nAnd the door closes, leaving us once more in total darkness. We can hear them bickering again as they shuffle away, their footsteps descending the stairs, fading into the uneasy silence of this old house... \nINT. FIFTH GRADE CLASSROOM, LOS ANGELES - DAY \nA young teacher (DARLA) chalks a lesson on a blackboard in a sun-drenched Los Angeles classroom. \nDARLA -- and we know from yesterday that the base of a triangle times half the height equals the area. \nA girl in the back row raises her hand. \nDARLA Yes, Mia? \nGIRL Lucy's asleep again. \nDarla puts down the chalk and comes up the aisle to where a slight, fair-skinned girl in a thrift shop dress sleeps head down on her desk. The girl from the opening scene. LUCY SHERIDAN. Darla stands over her with obvious concern. Puts a finger to her lips to quiet the giggles. \nDARLA Let her sleep. \nShe draws the shade. It drops a shadowbox on the sleeping girl. \nINT. COUNSELING ROOM, DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SERVICES, LOS ANGELES - DAY \nA former gang member sitting with his wife and troubled eight- year-old son. The MARTINEZ FAMILY. A family in crisis. Sitting opposite is an LA County social worker. Twenties. Attractive but overworked. EMILY. \nGANG MEMBER He would just go off, you know, start tearin' the place down. You didn't even know why he was doin' it half the time, you just got out of his way... \nEMILY And what you learned from your father now Diego's learning from you...? \nIt's painful for him to hear that. He loves his son, quit the streets for him. Overcome by emotion, he nods yes. \nEMILY That really upsets you, doesn't it? \nHe wipes his eyes on his tattooed arm. \nGANG MEMBER Yeah. Cuz I mean I don't want him to be like me. \nThe boy looks at his father, has never seen him cry before. \nINT. CORRIDOR - DAY \nOutside the conference room, Emily musses the boy's hair. \nEMILY A whole week without skipping school? Is that true? \nHe smiles, nods. A glimpse of the boy he might have been. \nEMILY That's the last time I make a bet with you. (to his parents) See you guys next week. \nThe Martinez family heads down the hall, Diego lagging behind. Emily watches with guarded optimism, knowing their chances. Then turns to the NEXT FAMILY, welcoming the BELEAGUERED MOTHER: \nEMILY You cut your hair. It looks great. \nINT. EMILY'S CUBICLE - DAY \nThe hurried opening and closing of files reveals PHOTOS of abused children. Bruises. Cuts. Broken bones. Emily trying to locate a single case amid the stacks and clutter on her desk. An angry mother SCREAMING at her on the phone: \nEMILY No one is trying to steal your child, they found bruises and cigarette burns -- Mrs Lynch, I read the medical report -- well, if you feel you need legal representation that's perfectly within your rights... \nA flurry of obscenities followed by a dial tone. Emily puts the phone down. Sighs wearily. \nWAYNE (O.S.) One less Christmas card for Emily. \nHer supervisor WAYNE, forties, gay, leaning in the doorway. \nWAYNE How many active cases you have? \nEMILY Thirty-eight. \nEmily nods yeah, leans in closer, the friendly banter giving way to a moment of real sincerity. \nEMILY If it were anyone, it'd be you. \nThey exchange a look then Doug clinks his glass against hers. And as they drink together after a long day, more than friends, less than lovers... \nINT. EMILY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nEmily in glasses, reading the Sheridan file on her bed. The preliminary report concerns her: \"Socially withdrawn. Lack of appetite. Sleeping at school...\" \nHer gaze returns to Lucy's photo. Sadly, under her breath: \nEMILY What are they doing to you? \nEXT. SHERIDAN HOUSE - DAY \nA dark, rundown family home on a once-prosperous cul de sac. Emily pulls up. Gets out. Checks that she has the right address. Halfway up the walk something stops her dead in her TRACKS - \nA WOMAN'S FACE \nstaring at her through one of the lacy white curtains upstairs. Ghostly pale. Gone as soon as she sees it. Emily stands frozen for a moment. Walks on. \nShe reaches to knock on the door and it opens abruptly, the security chain snapping taut. A woman's voice growls at her from the darkness inside: \nWOMAN'S VOICE What? \nEMILY Emily Jennings. Child Services? We spoke on the phone...? \nPeering through the crack is the pallid, bony face from the upstairs window. Lucy's mother. MARGARET SHERIDAN. \nMARGARET You said the seventeenth. \nEMILY Today is the seventeenth. \nMARGARET Is not. \nEMILY I'm sorry, but it is. \nMARGARET Friday was the thirteenth. \nEmily, rather amazed at the conversation she's having, takes a newspaper from her bag. Indicates the date. \nEMILY Friday was the fourteenth, that makes today the seventeenth. Monday the seventeenth. The date of our appointment. \nThe door closes in Emily's face. What the hell? Then we hear the chain unlock. It opens again. \nAnd we get our first good look at Lucy's mother. Gaunt. Pale. Dark rings under her eyes. She steps aside, not welcoming Emily in, merely allowing her to enter. \nINT. SHERIDAN HOUSE - DAY \nIt's dark, the curtains drawn. Margaret twitches one open in begrudging courtesy. The house is tidy but sad, steeped in a kind of puritanical gloom. Lucy peers down through the upstairs banister, anxious, unsure what's going on. Emily sees her, smiles. \nEMILY Come down, I'd like to meet you. \nLucy hesitates, sensing her mother's disapproval. Comes slowly down the stairs. Emily shakes her hand. \nEMILY My name's Emily. What's yours? \nLUCY Lucy. \nEMILY Pretty name. Pretty girl. \nLucy turns shyly away. \nEMILY (TO MARGARET) Is there somewhere we can talk? \nMargaret sighs and heads down the hall. \nINT. LIVING ROOM, SHERIDAN HOUSE - DAY \nEmily, file in hand, trying to project professionalism in an arm chair that tilts to one side. Margaret and Lucy sitting opposite on the sofa. \nEMILY When do you expect your husband back? \nMargaret shrugs. \nEMILY Because we've found it's more beneficial if the whole family participates. \nMARGARET Well he's not home so... \nShrugs again. \nEMILY Do you have any way of contacting him? \nMARGARET Not if I don't know where he is. \nJust then we hear a POWER TOOL go on in the basement. Emily, sensing the lie, indicates the floor. \nINT. PRIVATE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nGazing fondly at Lucy, Edward directs his comments at Wayne, who sits opposite the family with Emily. \nEDWARD They really are God's miracles. Day she was born was the happiest day of our lives. We're not perfect parents, we know that, but we figure if you let `em know how much you love `em a lot of the other stuff takes care of itself. \nWayne nods his agreement. Edward puts his arm around Lucy for effect. Her eyes go to Emily. A silent plea for help. \nEMILY (HOSTILE) Tell me, Mr Sheridan, since you've suddenly acquired the power of speech, doesn't it concern you a little that Lucy's grades have gone from A's to D's in three months? \nEDWARD Course it does, she's our daughter. \nWith a glance Wayne cautions Emily about her tone of voice. \nEMILY So you have no idea why she's falling asleep at school every day? Why she's not able to sleep at home? \nEdward looks at Margaret, then Emily, affects bewilderment. \nEDWARD Bad dreams? \nINT. BREAK ROOM - DAY \nEmily and Wayne in private conversation. She's pissed off. The Sheridan family in the other room, preparing to leave. \nEMILY He's gonna be having bad dreams when he gets hit with child endangerment. (off Wayne's reluctance) Don't tell me you're buying this daddy's little girl routine? \nWAYNE So they're overcompensating a little. \nEMILY A little? Let me talk to her. Alone. She wants to talk. \nWAYNE EM -- \nEMILY Five minutes. Talk to them about how much they love kids. \nShe goes out the door. \nINT. CORRIDOR - DAY \nEmily walks with Lucy, looking for a way in. \nEMILY I knew someone at school named Lucy, she was a writer. Do you ever write? I do sometimes, it helps me sort out how I'm feeling. \nLucy doesn't take the bait. She stops for a drink at a water fountain. Emily bends for a sip after. Misfires. As she wipes her face, embarrassed: \nEMILY Okay, I just shot like a gallon of water up my nose. So much for establishing trust. \nLucy smiles, for the first time. It's the opening Emily was looking for. Maintaining that precious eye contact, DEEPENING IT: \nEMILY What's happening to you? I can help. Let me help. \nLucy looks away, eyes brimming with tears. \nEMILY What is it, sweetheart? \nLUCY They hate me. \nShe lowers her head in shame, tears rolling down. \nEMILY I'm sure they don't hate you. \nLUCY They do. I hear them. They go in the cellar and talk. \nEMILY What do they talk about? \nLUCY Sending me to hell. \nEmily's mouth falls open. \nEMILY You've heard them say that? \nLucy nods. As Emily registers this in quiet horror... \nINT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nA tape recorder is running. Emily and Wayne alone with Lucy. She's hesitant to speak, naturally distrustful. \nEMILY It's okay. You can tell him. He's on our side. \nWAYNE Did you hear your parents say they were going to hurt you? \nNobody sees what Lucy sees at this moment. Edward glaring in at her through the window. Lucy looks at Wayne, shakes her head. Wayne looks at Emily, case closed. \nINT. CORRIDOR - DAY \nEmily watches in agony as the Sheridan family steps into the elevator. Parent on each side, Lucy gives her one last pleading look then the elevator doors close and she's gone. \nINT. WAYNE'S OFFICE - DAY \nLUCY If I do? \nEmily holds her gaze, seeing the fear. Backing away, Lucy indicates the bus. \nLUCY I have to go. They get mad when I miss the bus. \nLucy turns to go. Emily watches. Helpless. \nEMILY Lucy, wait... \nTakes her cell phone from her bag. Puts her number on speed dial. \nEMILY If anything happens, call me, okay? Just press this. Don't let your parents know you have it. \nTucks the cell phone in Lucy's coat pocket. \nEMILY I'm gonna get you out of there, I promise. \nLucy boards the bus. Waves to Emily from a back window as it drives away. Emily waves back, heart in her throat. Might be the last time she sees her alive. \nINT. EMILY'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nA sleepless night finds Emily slouched on her sofa, leaving a MESSAGE: \nANSWERING MACHINE Hey, this is Doug, here it comes - \nBEEP. \nEMILY It's me, thought you might be up, um, anyway, call if you get this. \nHangs up. Clicks on the tv remote. Channel-surfs. World news. Cooking show. Home shopping network. \nHip-hop music video. Watches it for a moment. Gangster with a mic. Scantily-clad girls shaking their asses. \nThe phone RINGS. Emily mutes the tv, picks up. \nEMILY Too late, I met someone else... \nA child's whisper. \nLUCY (V.O.) Emily...? \nEMILY (concerned but calm) Lucy? Are you okay? \nLUCY (V.O.) I'm scared... \nEMILY Why? Why are you scared, honey? \nLUCY (V.O.) They're waiting to get me, I can hear them... I'm sorry... \nEMILY Why are you sorry? \nLUCY (V.O.) I'm falling asleep... \nEMILY Okay, listen, I want you to go over and open the window. Can you do that? Lucy...? \nLUCY (V.O.) (softly; drifting off) I'm sooorry... \nEMILY Lucy, no, wake up! \nINT. LUCY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThe cell phone lying on the bed at Lucy's fingertips. \nEMILY (FROM PHONE) Lucy...?! \nThe illuminated screen casts an eerie glow on her SLEEPING FACE. \nINT. EMILY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nEmily drops the phone. Moment of panic. Then a decision. Throws a coat on over her bed clothes. Grabs the phone again, dials a number in desperation. \nEMILY Mike, it's Emily, listen, that girl I told you about, I think she's in trouble - - yeah, I know what you said, but -- Mike, you're not listening -- (LOSES IT) HELP ME! \nEXT. EMILY'S CAR - NIGHT \nEmily fumbles with her keys. Gets the right one in the door. Opens it. Jumps in. Starts the engine. Peels off down the road. \nINT. LUCY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThe cell phone turns itself off, plunging the room into total darkness. \nIn BLACK, we hear FOOTSTEPS coming up the stairs. Down the hall. Stopping at the door. The knob turning. The click of the latch. The door opening. A shaft of light. Edward and Margaret peering in with frenzied anticipation: \nLucy is asleep. The time has come. \nINT. EMILY'S CAR - NIGHT \nEmily shoves Margaret aside and throws open the oven. Pulls Lucy out onto the kitchen floor, swatting out her burning pajamas with a dish towel. \nMargaret grabs a steak knife and rushes at Emily, but Barron has her covered. Backhands Margaret so hard it spins her around fully before dropping her to the floor. \nBARRON The hell's the matter with you people?! \nPajamas scorched, wild with terror, Lucy cries in great heaving sobs in Emily's arms. Reduced to tears herself, Emily keeps saying the same thing over and over. \nEMILY I gotcha... I gotcha... I gotcha... \nShielding her from the sight of her parents: Margaret sprawled on the linoleum weeping. Edward slouched against the fridge, blood pouring down his shirt, his broken jaw hanging open like a man thinking wow. \nINT. COUNTY COURTROOM - DAY \nEdward and Margaret holding hands at the defendant's table, remorseless and defiant in their Sunday best. Among the many spectators we find Emily and Mike Barron. The STATE PROSECUTOR and PUBLIC DEFENDER addressing the JUDGE. \nSTATE PROSECUTOR Prosecution asks that you disallow an insanity defense. This was an act committed with premeditation, malice AFORETHOUGHT - \nPUBLIC DEFENDER Your honor, the egregiousness of the crime makes the competency question all the more relevant. \nJUDGE Yes. I hereby order the defendants undergo psychiatric evaluation to determine their mental fitness for trial. \nEmily rolls her eyes at Barron, some justice system. \nEXT. COURTHOUSE PARKING LOT - DAY \nBarron walks Emily to her car. She's outraged. \nEMILY Steal a pizza, San Quentin, try killing your kid, Freudian dream analysis. \nBARRON Well, you're gonna hate me for saying this, but my money's on crazy. \nEMILY Did they or did they not know what they were doing? That's the legal standard. They knew, they knew damn well! \nBARRON It's not that simple sometimes. \nEMILY (stops on a dime) Meaning what exactly? \nBarron hesitates. He's crossing the line by telling her this. \nBARRON When we brought them in that night they told Captain Lister... They think she's evil, some kind of demon spirit, minion of the devil or something. \nEMILY (LAUGHS) Oh, that's great - what is this, late- night cable? \nBARRON No, but that might be the world they're living in. \nINT. CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL - DAY \nLucy in a hospital bed, dressings on her hand. Emily's friend Doug sitting bedside. Child psychologist. \nDOUG -- and what's the most important thing we talked about that you have to remember? \nLUCY It's not my fault what happened. \nDOUG That's right and you know what? It's not. \nLucy nods, not entirely convinced. Doug gives her a pat, crosses to the exit. At the door he runs into Emily. Shakes his head, awed at what she did. \nDOUG That is some seriously proactive social work happenin' there. You all right? \nEMILY Yeah, I'm okay. How's she doing? \nDOUG Typical reaction, blames herself. We'll get there. I'm gonna put her in a group setting, see if I can get her to open up. \nEMILY Group therapy for kids, what's that say about the world? \nHe nods - no kidding, heads off. Emily comes over and sits on Lucy's bed. Strokes her hair. \nEMILY Good news. You get to leave here tomorrow. \nLUCY Doug said I might have to go to a state home. \nEMILY Only for a few days, till we find a better place. \nLUCY Why can't I live with you? \nEMILY Oh, sweetheart. That would never be allowed. \nLUCY Why? \nEMILY It's complicated, there's a whole process, I'm not even a foster parent... \nLucy gives a sad nod. Emily touches her arm. \nEMILY I'm sorry. \nEXT. STATE CHILDREN'S HOME - DAY \nEMILY An eight-year-old did this? There's no way. \nBARRON I was there when they brought him in. Took three guys my size to subdue him. Kid was climbing the walls. \nBarron turns to the window and - WHAM! - AN ATTACK DOG HITS THE GLASS RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIS FACE. Barron recoils with a yelp. Then, embarrassed, eyes the TRIO OF BATTLE-SCARRED PIT BULLS prowling the chainlink-fenced backyard. \nBARRON Just your average American family. \nEXT. MARTINEZ HOUSE - DAY \nEmily and Barron come down the steps. \nEMILY Where is he now? \nBARRON Juvie lockup. And, no, I'm not taking you to see him. \nEMILY You want to know what happened? \nBARRON I know what happened. \nEMILY I don't. I need to talk to him. Mike, please, I care about this kid. \nINT. JUVENILE DETENTION CENTER - DAY \nDiego Martinez sitting alone in a holding cell. Confused. Scared. He sees Emily approaching and immediately breaks down. \nEMILY Diego... \nEmily tells the cop at the cell door: \nEMILY Let me in. He won't hurt me. \nThe cop looks at Mike Barron who nods it's okay. The cop opens the cell. Emily enters. Diego looks up at her, shuddering with emotion: \nDIEGO Are they dead? \nEmily, gutted, nods yes. Diego buries his face in Emily's stomach and sobs. \nEMILY What happened? Tell me what happened. \nDIEGO (SOBBING) I killed my mum and dad... \nEmily, devastated, trades looks with Barron through the bars. \nEXT. VENICE PIER - DAY \nDoug tenderly consoles Emily. Has his arms around her. They're leaning against the railing, wind on their faces. \nDOUG Every family you sit down with every day of every week is a family in crisis. Those are your odds. That's the job you do. Trying to beat them. \nWipes away her tears. The hair from her face. \nDOUG You're one person, Em. You can't save the world. (THEN) I know somebody you did save. \nLucy on the beach below, walking barefoot at water's edge, hem of her dress in her hands. Emily watches her and, finding solace in it, leans into Doug's embrace and closes her eyes. \nEXT. BEACH - DAY \nThe plaintive cries of seagulls overhead as Emily and Lucy walk along the surf at sundown, Emily barefoot now as well. \nLUCY You okay? \nEmily nods, putting on a brave face to spare Lucy. \nEMILY It's just work. Don't worry. \nLucy nods okay. They walk on in silence for a moment. \nLUCY Why do you do it if it makes you sad? \nEMILY My job? I don't know, I guess... I guess maybe I want to believe families can work, so I can have my own someday, I don't know - does that make sense? \nLucy nods, takes her hand. They walk off up the beach together. \nINT. EMILY'S HOUSE - DAY \nEmily, days later, dressed for work, halves an omelet with a spatula and slides the halves onto two plates. \nEMILY (calls to other room) Breakfast. \nThere's no answer. Emily goes to get her. \nINT. LUCY'S ROOM - DAY \nStops in the doorway. \nEMILY Honey, breakfa-- \nEMILY Did you not hear me? I'm telling you, Mike, as a friend, I did not call that family. \nBARRON Then who did? Go find the guy who broke in and just happened to dial the number of a kid whose case you handle. \nEmily starts to say something, but stops as a confounding realization comes to her. And then to Barron. \nINT. EMILY'S HOUSE - DAY \nLucy sits on the sofa studying a photo of Diego. Emily sits beside her, her advocate. Barron opposite. \nLUCY He's in my group... (puts down photo) ...why, did something happen? \nEmily nods yes. Barron, gently, mindful of Lucy's age: \nBARRON We're trying to figure out why. He got a call Thursday night from this number. I'm just wondering if he might have said anything... \nLUCY It wasn't me. \nBARRON You didn't call him? \nLucy shakes her head. Barron nods okay, then, speaking to her as a father might his own daughter: \nBARRON Lucy, it's hard sometimes to tell the truth, but I know you will because you're a good little girl. \nLUCY I am telling the truth. \nEMILY My backup files are in your room. Diego's is in there. Maybe you got curious and went through some, dialed a number? \nLUCY It wasn't me, I swear. \nComplete innocence. Emily nods okay, wanting to believe, but remembering the stolen photograph. \nBARRON The call was at 2 am, are you ever up that late? \nLUCY I didn't call him. \nBARRON Are you ever up that late? \nEMILY Mike, she said no. Maybe someone made a mistake. \nBarron reads Emily's posture and disengages, stands to go. \nBARRON Yeah, maybe so. Night, Lucy. \nINT. FRONT DOOR, EMILY'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nExiting, Barron tells Emily as gently as possible: \nBARRON She's lying. \nAnd goes down the steps. Emily closes the door. Turns around and there's Lucy. Uncomfortably close. \nLUCY Do you believe me? \nEMILY I believe you. \nLucy hugs her and Emily hugs her back, but she's still thinking about what Barron said. \nINT. EMILY'S CUBICLE - DAY \nA PHOTO of Emily and Diego tacked to the corkboard panel beside her desk. Emily sits contemplating it. Her gaze goes from the photo to the BARE SHELF above her desk. Her caseload is still missing. This is bullshit. \nINT. WAYNE'S OFFICE - DAY \nEmily walks in, power pose. \nEMILY Give me back my cases or fire me. Right now. \nWayne, caught unprepared, eating a doughnut. \nINT. EMILY'S OFFICE - DAY \nCaseload restored, Emily is multi-tasking, opening mail, sorting backlogged paperwork, talking on the phone: \nEMILY I don't care if it's a hairline fracture, he broke her arm, I don't want him back in that house. He what? He found Christ? When? That recently? Uh huh. Well he should have found Him sooner. \nHangs up. Doug leans in the doorway, drops a manila envelope in her in-box. And a computer printout. \nEMILY What's up? \nDOUG Copy of the Sheridans' psych evals for the file. And the cognitive profile Lucy did for me the other day. \nEMILY (re: Lucy's profile) How's it look? \nDOUG WINTERS Normal. \nBut his tone suggests otherwise. \nINT. LUCY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nEMILY SILHOUETTED in the doorway, keeping her distance as she SAYS GOODNIGHT: \nEMILY Get some rest. \nShe starts to close the door. \nLUCY You forgot to kiss me goodnight. \nA tense pause then Emily walks over and kisses her on the forehead. \nEMILY Goodnight. \nLucy clutches her wrist as she turns to go. \nLUCY I love you. \nEmily, trapped, forces a tender smile. \nEMILY I love you, too. \nLucy's EYES GLEAM in the darkness. She turns onto her side for sleep, but those eyes don't shut even after Emily has walked out and closed the door behind her. \nINT. DOUG'S CONDO - NIGHT \nFootball highlights on a liquid plasma tv. Doug flipping through a DSM IV diagnostic manual. The phone RINGS. He picks up, distracted, scanning the DSM index. \nDOUG Hello? \nA strange INTERMITTENT STATIC BUZZ on the line. \nDOUG Hello...? \nBZZZZT. BZZZZT. BZZZZT. A telecommunications glitch. \nDOUG Try again, sorry. \nHe hangs up. Finds the chapter he's looking for. ANTI- SOCIAL PERSONALITY TYPE. But he hears it again now - \nBZZZZZZZZT BZZZZZZZZZT - louder, deeper - and realizes, in quiet terror, that it's coming from INSIDE HIS EAR. \nINT. DOUG'S BATHROOM - NIGHT \nDoug opens the medicine cabinet and grabs a Q-tip. Wiggles it around in his ear and when he takes it out there's a \nHORNET \nsitting on the cottony tip, scissoring its wings. \nDoug stares in disbelief. Mouth gaping. \nHe throws the Q-tip in the toilet. Hits the flush lever. Watches the hornet spiral away. Gone. \nStares at the empty bowl. Did I just imagine that? \nShaken, he turns to the sink. Wedges his head under the tap and runs water into his ear. \nStraightens and looks at himself in the mirror, toweling his face, trying to impose rational thought on the situation. But as the water spills from his ear, down his neck, onto his shirt, it brings with it - \nTWO MORE LIVE HORNETS, half drowned. \nWith a yelp Doug swipes them from his shirt. Crushes them underfoot. Terrified, but clinging to rational thought a moment longer, he turns his head sideways to the mirror, parts his hair, and sees - \nANOTHER HORNET crawl from the ear canal, followed by SIX OR SEVEN MORE! \nDOUG FUCK! \nRationality goes out the window. He flails at them with the towel. Swats them dead. Picks them up and drops them in the toilet. Studies the last one for a moment. Its little legs twitching. Drops it in. Flushes. \nA false respite. And a brief one. Because as the FLUSHING NOISE FADES he can hear an ominous DEEP BUZZING SOUND RISING. \nIt's coming from behind him. He turns to have a look. Nothing there. Bare wall. \nBut it's strange: the BUZZING IS STILL BEHIND HIM. \nWith dawning horror Doug turns and checks his back in the mirror, sees \nHIS ENTIRE SHIRT BACK IS CRAWLING WITH HORNETS! \nWhimpering like a child, he undoes the buttons of his shirt, taking it off as delicately as possible. Slipping his arms gently from the sleeves. \nHolding it by the collar, he takes two quick steps and tosses it in the shower. Slams the glass door, seals the crack with towels. And watches the hornets fly around in the glass enclosure, BUZZING FURIOUSLY, bouncing off the glass. \nBut as he backpedals he realizes the FURIOUS BUZZING is too close, too loud and too deep, to be coming from the shower over there. A sharp pain in his head confirms it. He GROANS and brings a hand to his ear as something awful happens inside. \nThe BUZZING in his right ear spreads to his left - LOUDER, ANGRIER, its sources multiplying. Disoriented, he stumbles backwards with an AGONIZING SCREAM. Catches sight of himself in the mirror, the terror of the moment on his face. This can't be happening. \nEMILY You're saying he did that to himself? \nCORONER It appears all his injuries were self- inflicted, yes. \nEMILY Oh come on. He looked like he'd been beaten to death! Don't tell me he was some - some suicidal... (BREAKING DOWN) ...I knew him! He was my best friend! \nShe turns away crying. \nCORONER Miss, I would never presume to know your friend better than you. But the injuries suggest he was trying to hurt himself. Unfortunately, he succeeded. I am sorry. \nEmily, composing herself, gives a quiet nod. She has no quarrel with this man. \nEMILY Have you ever seen this before, somebody dying like this? \nThe coroner files the report, world weary. \nCORONER Truly, I am shocked every day by the violence people do to themselves. \nINT. CEMETERY - DAY \nDOUGLAS J. WINTERS etched in granite. A final prayer read by a PRIEST as he is laid to rest. \nA breeze ruffles the clothes of the MOURNERS. Blows hair across Emily's haunted face. \nLucy, at her side, sees her grief and reaches for her hand. Instinctively, Emily retracts it. Lucy registers the slight, the wider implications. \nEmily watches the coffin descend. She weeps openly. \nINT. EMILY'S CAR - DAY \nEmily, red-eyed, driving home, sees something in her peripheral vision that sends a chill through her. \nLucy, gazing quietly out the passenger-side window, is SWINGING HER LEGS in that contented way children do. A small but telling detail. Immediately HER LEGS STOP SWINGING, sensing Emily's stare. And with her head still turned away: \nLUCY You think it's my fault, don't you? \nShe turns to face Emily, who measures her words. \nEMILY It was an accident. It was nobody's fault. \nLucy holds her gaze. Then, as if to test her, reaches again for Emily's hand. Trapped in the lie, Emily has to let her. And as she drives on in that private hell, holding hands with Lucy... \nINT. MIKE BARRON'S OFFICE - DAY \nEmily, an emotional wreck, confides in Barron. \nEMILY He was scared. He came out of that room with her, Mike, and he was scared. He said she threatened him. \nBARRON Listen. You're still in shock. Let's NOT -- \nEMILY Diego said it was a man on the phone. You know who made that call. There was no one else in the house. (off his look) You think I don't know how crazy this sounds?! \nBARRON Look, I don't know, all I'm saying is a kid in his state of mind maybe isn't the most reliable witness. \nEMILY Why is he in that state of mind? Why was Doug? Pull my phone records. See if she called him. \nBARRON Emily. I already did. There were no calls from your house. \nEmily's argument collapses. She sits there for a moment, vexed, her intellect telling her one thing, her gut another. She gets up to go. Pauses at the door. \nEMILY Her mother and father, their bedroom door has these deadbolts on it, big ones, two of `em... Something came through that door and they didn't want it ever coming through there again. \nINT. EMILY'S CUBICLE - DAY \nEmily digs through her in-box, spilling things on the floor. Finds the manila envelope Doug gave her. Rips it open. Dumps the contents into her hand. \nA VIDEO TAPE \nTyped on the label: Sheridan, Marg. & Ed., Prelim. Psych Interviews. \nCUT TO: \nON A TELEVISION - Margaret Sheridan sits facing the camera, responding to the questions of an unseen interviewer. Her haunted face and frank tone make the interview chilling. \nINTERVIEWER And by forcing your daughter into the oven, can you tell me, what did you think the outcome would be? \nMARGARET You mean what were we doing it for? \nINTERVIEWER Yes. \nMARGARET To kill her. \nINTERVIEWER Why? \nMARGARET God's will. \nINT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nEDWARD IT'S NOT CHILD KILLING IF SHE'S NOT A CHILD! \nAnd that's the interview. Emily stares at the BLANK BLUE SCREEN, transfixed, lowers her gaze to the table. \nThere's a PHOTO tucked inside the psychiatric file. Edward and Margaret in happier times - YOUNG BIBLE CAMP COUNSELORS in T-shirts and hiking boots on a path through sunlit forest. Sweet. Innocent. Emily's age. The year they met perhaps. \nShe holds it up to the newspaper mugshots for a before-and- after comparison. The transformation of their faces is shocking. Emily sits frozen by the realization: Edward and Margaret Sheridan. Not criminals. Victims. \nINT. STATE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY \nAn old brick orphanage turned psychiatric hospital. Emily's Volvo goes up the winding tree-lined drive. \nCHIEF PSYCHIATRIST (V.O.) Unfortunately Mrs Sheridan suffered a rather severe psychotic episode last night... \nINT. STATE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY \nEmily and the CHIEF PSYCHIATRIST walk down a dark, institutional corridor. \nCHIEF PSYCHIATRIST ...Woke up screaming, absolutely convinced she was on fire. She wasn't, of course, they managed to sedate her. But it's curious, she displays all the symptoms of a burn patient. Except the burns themselves... \nMargaret's door. Emily peers through a little square of reinforced glass. A padded cell. Margaret strapped to a bed. Writhing in pain. Laboring to breathe. Eyes swimming. \nCHIEF PSYCHIATRIST In no condition for visitors as you can see. If you'd like, I could let you see Mr Sheridan? \nEmily hesitates, afraid of him. \nEMILY Okay. \nShe casts a departing glance through the window and shudders to see that Margaret's roaming eyes have locked on her in a hollow stare. \nINT. VISITATION ROOM, PSYCH HOSPITAL - DAY \nRestrained in a straitjacket, Edward is brought in by two orderlies who seat him at a table opposite Emily and then exit. Jaw wired, everything he says is spoken through clenched teeth. \nEMILY I know I'm probably the last person you want to see right now, but you're... \nHis stare unnerves her. She stops and collects herself. \nEMILY You're the only one I can talk to. Lucy's been staying with me - \nEDWARD Who died? \nEmily falls silent. Her voice cracks with emotion. \nEMILY A friend. \nEdward nods yup. Regards her in silence. Emily speaks, or tries to, just to fill that awful void. \nEMILY I, ummm... \nEDWARD You're scared. \nEmily, skewered again, nods yes. \nEDWARD You oughta be. \nDead silence. She meets his gaze. And there is eye contact, true understanding. \nEDWARD You judged us before you ever walked in that house. Sat there in our living room tellin' us about our problems, how to be better parents - certain of everything and dead wrong about all of it. (THEN) Ask what you came to ask. \nAfter a moment: \nEMILY What is she? \nIt's a question Edward has asked himself once or twice. He leans back in his chair and folds his arms with an almost casual air. \nEDWARD Can tell you what she's not. She not a daughter of mine. She's not a ten-year- old having trouble in school. She's not some innocent victim whose door you busted down and life you saved. And she's not going no place, lady, till she's good and done with you. \nEMILY Done with me how? \nEDWARD However she wants. You think it's an accident her ending up with you? She saw you coming a mile away. \nEMILY Why me? I don't have anything. \nEDWARD You have that you're good. Kindness. Decency. That's what she feeds on. Bleeds ya dry, moves onto the next. We were a big family, she went through us like a wrecking ball. And you know, every time something happened, every time, we had an excuse for why it wasn't her fault. Cuz it's easier to lie to yourself than think bad things about your baby girl. But finally we got to a point where me and Maggy looked at each other - (remembers so clearly) - where we looked at each other and we was out of lies, both of us. Most terrifying moment of our lives. And that's where you are now. \nEmily silently registering this truth. \nEDWARD I'll tell you this. She sees everything. And what she doesn't see she just sort of senses it, like when you call a friend and they pick up before it rings? (MORE) \nEDWARD(CONT'D) Only time you got the upper hand is when she's sleepin' but she almost never does. We checked on her every night for three months. Every twenty minutes, up and down those stairs. First time she slept was the night you kicked in my front door. \nAfter a moment: \nEMILY What does she want? \nEDWARD To know... what your idea of hell is... and make you live there. \ngets off and comes up the sidewalk toward the house. Sensing Emily's stare, she stops and meets it. Waves, testing the waters. Emily waves back but it's a hollow gesture. Lucy's smile fades, knowing this as she continues toward the house. \nIn a sudden panic Emily goes into the kitchen, grabs one of the knives. Eyes the blade, forced to contemplate the unthinkable - its use as a weapon, self-defense. \nShe comes into the living room, holding it. Catches sight of herself in the mirror. A jarring image: \nSweet Emily Jennings with a butcher's knife in her hand. \nThe sound of LUCY'S FOOTSTEPS on the front steps breaks the spell. \nEmily hides the knife behind the fish tank. No good, you can see it through the glass. \nWe hear LUCY'S KEY IN THE LOCK. \nEmily grabs the knife. It's in her hand as the door CLICKS open, until the last second when she tosses it under a sofa pillow. \nLucy enters. Shy. Innocent. A ten-year-old home from school. \nLUCY Hi. \nEmily returns a plastic smile. \nEMILY Hi. \nLUCY You weren't there so I took the bus. \nEMILY Sorry, work - lost track of time. \nLUCY It's okay, I know how busy you are. \nEmily watches unnerved as Lucy crosses to the sofa, to the very pillow where she hid the butcher's knife, and sits down to untie her shoes. The point of the knife is almost touching her leg. If she moves at all, it will cut the skin. \nLUCY Doesn't matter anyway, the bus stops right at the end of the street. So I can always get home, whether you're there or not. \nEMILY Lucky. \nLucy nods then pauses and looks at the pillow, or appears to, but she is actually looking at the end table. \nLUCY Where's the phone? \nEMILY Oh, it wasn't working... \nLucy nods oh. Finishes untying her shoes then gets up and walks into the kitchen, checks the wall, turns to Emily. \nLUCY Wow. That one, too. \nEmily, caught in a lie, says nothing. \nLUCY Can I have a shower? We had gym today... \nEmily nods. Lucy heads into the bathroom. Pauses at the door, back turned. \nLUCY Are they being nice to her? \nEMILY Who? \nLUCY My mother. \nShe turns for Emily's reaction. \nEMILY How - how would I know that? \nLUCY I thought you said you were going to see her. \nEMILY I never said that. \nLucy frowns. A bewilderment that seems genuine. \nLUCY Hm. I must have dreamt it. \nGoes into the bathroom. Closes the door. \nINT. EMILY'S HOUSE - DAY \nEar pressed to the bathroom door, Emily listens to the RUNNING WATER: Lucy taking a shower. \nShe goes to the closet, unlocks it. Grabs one of the phones. \nINT. EMILY'S KITCHEN - DAY \nIt sounds like EMILY'S VOICE is coming from the fridge until we sweep past it to see her crouching by a phone jack in the corner. Whispering. \nEMILY I don't care, Robin, anywhere. Just find somewhere that will take her. Tonight. I don't want this girl in my house. \nEmily unplugs the phone. And just then hears a SOFT BREATH behind her. Oh shit. Slowly turns. \nLUCY IN A BATH ROBE BEHIND HER. \n- and to the shock of the other PARENTS waiting outside. Nancy comes after her in a fury. Runs her down. Erupts. \nNANCY Who do you think you are barging in there like that?! \nEMILY I don't want her in group anymore, I don't want her around the other kids. \nNANCY Well that's not your decision, is it?! \nEmily opens her mouth to reply, but Lucy beats her to the punch. \nLUCY It's okay, Nancy, Emily's been under a lot of stress lately, but she's really nice to me and I hope I can stay with her a really long time. \nNancy, disarmed by the glowing praise, turns back to Emily. \nNANCY We'll talk about this later. \nStorms off. \nLUCY See you next week, Nancy. \nNancy doesn't hear, busily reassuring parents, damage control. Emily and Lucy arrive at the elevator. Emily hits the button. \nEMILY You're never going back there. \nLUCY Why, Emily? \nEmily says nothing. Lucy keeps asking the same question, in the exact same intonation, as Emily ignores her: \nLUCY Why, Emily? Why, Emily? Why, Emily? \nDING. The doors open. \nINT. ELEVATOR - DAY \nEmily and Lucy step in. The door closes. Lucy continuing her verbal assault as they start to descend: \nLUCY Why, Emily? Why, Emily? \nSuddenly the ELEVATOR LURCHES TO A VIOLENT STOP. It buckles Emily's knees. She is terrified, practically hyperventilating. \nEMILY W-w-what's happening - ?! \nLucy has gotten her attention. \nLUCY Can I go back to group next week? \nEMILY You're never going back there! \nLucy looks at her as one regards a small dumb animal. Then looks up at the ceiling. \nLUCY Are you sure? \nHorror as Emily realizes what she's thinking. We hear the first CABLE SNAP above them. In the CREAKING HUSH that FOLLOWS: \nEMILY No... \nThe second CABLE SNAPS. The elevator goes into a HELLISH FREE FALL. \nThe acceleration is dizzying. \nEmily clutches the rail with both hands, SCREAMING as the elevator goes cannonballing down the shaft. Lucy indifferent as they plummet toward certain death. \nThe floor indicator light races toward L, the car shuddering violently, the noise deafening. It's a horrible way to die. \nEmily closes her eyes in anticipation of impact. And in the sudden BLACKNESS there's no noise at all. Just a soft, DISTINCT \nDING. \nA breathless pause then Emily opens her eyes. And sees the elevator is no longer falling. Never was. The doors glide open to the first floor lobby. \nLucy gives her a quiet look and strolls out. A businessman steps into the elevator, watching bewildered as Emily releases her white-knuckled grip on the railing and staggers out, so badly shaken she can barely stand... \nINT. EMILY'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nFish swim languidly in the tank. It's after midnight. We're looking down the darkened hall at Emily's closed bedroom door. \nINT. EMILY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nEmily, in a coat and shoes, packing a suitcase. Snaps it quietly shut. Looks over at the barricaded door. Draws a tense breath. \nINT. HALLWAY - NIGHT \nFrom down the hall we hear the DEADBOLTS SLIDE QUIETLY OPEN. \nThe door opens a crack. \nEMILY'S TERRIFIED FACE peers out. Making sure the hall is empty. \nSILENCE. \nEmily listening, barely breathing. Is that it? Is she gone? \nAnd then suddenly - WHAM! - WHAM! - WHAM! - the pounding turns VIOLENT, practically shaking the door off its hinges. Far too violent for a little girl. \nEmily wedges herself into the corner, absolutely petrified. There is something very strong and very angry on the other side of that door, SHRIEKING in the voice of a child - \nLUCY (O.S.) LET ME IN! \nWHAM - WHAM - WHAM - WHAM - WHAM - WHAM! \nLUCY (O.S.) LET ME IN! \nWHAM - WHAM - WHAM - WHAM - WHAM - WHAM! The door getting absolutely pummeled, looking like it might splinter from the force. And it's so intense that it's almost surreal what Emily is seeing. Lucy's voice eerily monotone, the words coming inhumanly fast like some auctioneer from hell - \nLUCY (O.S.) Let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in... \nRelentless. Tormenting Emily. Until she can't take it anymore. And she SCREAMS as loud as she can, half cursing, half begging, the veins standing out in her neck - \nEMILY LEAVE ME ALONE!!! \nAnd the POUNDING STOPS DEAD. All we hear is the rain drumming on the roof. And Emily's QUICK TERRIFIED BREATHS as she stares at the door wondering what's next. \nBut there's nothing. Just the shadows dancing on the walls. It appears the nightmare is over for now. \nBut not quite. \nA sudden CLUNK in the closet makes her jump. Her head snaps around - what was that? She just stares, unable to breathe because whatever she just heard is INSIDE HER ROOM! \nWhite-knuckled grip on that screwdriver, Emily stands up and comes slowly over to the CLOSET DOOR. \nRaises the screwdriver. Ready to stab. \nTakes hold of the door handle. \nSlowly turns it. \nOpens the door. \nPITCH BLACK inside. \nA tense pause as she stares into that blackness, then reaches a hand into the closet, feeling around for the pull-string. Finds it. Gives it a tug. And there, right in front of her, is a vision of unspeakable horror: \nMARGARET SHERIDAN \nTwitching spasmodically in a hospital gown. HIDEOUSLY BURNED. \nShe comes at Emily arms flailing, clumsy with rage and dementia. Emily leaps aside and Margaret goes careening into the furniture, howling and spinning like some crazed Whirling Dervish. \nEmily scrambles over the bed. Reaches the door. Fumbles at the deadbolt. Here comes Margaret. At the last second Emily gets the door open. Runs out. \nINT. HALLWAY - NIGHT \nTears a path down the dark hallway. Margaret right behind her, hideous, reeling, hitting the walls with her flailing arms. \nEmily throws open the front door. \nEXT. EMILY'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nDashes from the house into the abandoned street. Running in the rain. Margaret comes crashing out of the house, chasing her down the middle of the street. \nEmily sees a city bus parked up ahead. Makes a run for it. \nEXT. METRO BUS - NIGHT \nA metro transit bus idling along the curb. The DRIVER with his feet up between shifts, reading a porno mag. Emily comes running up to the door. Pounds frantically on the glass. \nEMILY Help me! Please! \nThe driver meets eyes with her through the door. Keeps reading. Unimpressed. More pounding from Emily. \nEMILY Let me on! \nThe driver points to the sign above the door: OUT OF SERVICE. Keeps reading. Emily near hysterics at this point. Margaret closing in fast. \nEMILY She's coming! Please! \nThe driver sighs, weighing his obligations. Emily spins, back to the door. Margaret nearly upon her, ten feet away, five, four... \nINT. METRO BUS - NIGHT \nThe driver opens the door. Emily dives backwards onto the bus, the door snapping closed in front of her just as Margaret lunges for her throat. \nEMILY Drive! \nBUS DRIVER There's nobody out there. \nSuccessive pages show the same two hands, but leaning forward into the inky blackness between them is a FACE, its features resolving into murky focus as it approaches the glass. The last page is a horrific image. A man screaming in such terror that his face appears almost deformed. \nIt's DOUG. The night of his death. Like a snapshot from his bathroom mirror. \nEmily shudders, the stack of pages tumbling to the floor. Runs out. And we see the photocopies, lying on the floor, are totally BLANK... \nINT. CORRIDOR, CHILD SERVICES BUILDING - NIGHT \nEmily, leaving, rushes down a corridor toward the lobby. Tense. Head on a swivel. Hears MORE SQUEAKING behind her. Spins. \nA NIGHT JANITOR WHEELING A MOP BUCKET \nShe walks on. Turns the corner and RUNS INTO SOMEONE UNEXPECTED. Jumps back with a SHRIEK before she realizes who it is. \nEMILY Robin... \nA ponytailed woman in her mid-forties, the child placement specialist Emily called from home. \nROBIN What are you doing here so late? I tried calling you. I found someone to take Lucy. \nEMILY (STUNNED RELIEF) You did? \nROBIN Anaheim couple. They've helped us out before. \nShe shows Emily a custody form with an attached photo: \nA KIND HUSBAND AND WIFE WITH TWO YOUNG CHILDREN. \nEmily's face darkens. \nEMILY (under her breath) Oh God... \nROBIN What's the matter? \nEmily stares at the unsuspecting family. Lucy's next victims. She fends off a wave of emotion as the full horror of her predicament hits her. Then, matter-of-factly, facing that fear head-on: \nEMILY I can't. I'm keeping her. \nAs Emily walks off, ripping the custody form to shreds, Robin utterly confused... \nINT. STATE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY \nEmily sits opposite Edward Sheridan in the visiting room, an odd sense of camaraderie between them. \nEMILY If I get rid of her, if I put her into the system... \nEDWARD (NODS YUP) She starts all over again somewhere else. Can't let her stay, can't let her go. That leaves you with one option. \nEye contact. Emily looks away, shakes her head. \nEMILY I can't, Edward, I -- \nEDWARD You have to. You have to find the strength. Don't you understand? That's why she's doing this. To test you. Test your faith. \nEMILY I don't have any faith. \nEDWARD How `bout anger. Got some of that? \nEmily lowers her gaze to the table. \nEMILY How... how do I...? \nEDWARD Kill her? In her sleep, assuming you can... (THEN; THINKING) Tell you what I'd do different. Count myself dead at the outset. Accept that going in and use it to my advantage. That's the one thing I don't think she'd see coming, someone giving up their own life to take hers. \nAs Emily registers this... \nINT. EMILY'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nMiddle of the night, the living room is lit by the eerie glow of the fish tank. The filter humming. The fish swimming languidly. Suddenly they DISPERSE, spooked by something outside the tank. \nINT. EMILY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThe bureau has been pushed in front of the deadbolted door to form a barricade. Emily lies in a fetal position on her bed, exhausted but unable to sleep. \nShe tenses at the sound of a MUFFLED MALE VOICE in the other room. Comes over to the door, trying to listen. Thinks she recognizes it. \nEMILY (calls through door) Mike...? \nNo reply. \nA moment of indecision then Emily tightens her grip on the screwdriver and quietly slides open the deadbolts. \nINT. HALLWAY - NIGHT \nShe comes slowly down the hall, following the VOICE to its source, stops in the living room doorway, haunted... \nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nIt's a different Mike Barron than last we saw. Gone is the quiet assurance. Whatever happened rocked him to the core. He closes the door for privacy. \nBARRON There's something I want you to hear. Came in at two o'clock last night. You might wanna sit. \nEmily sits. Barron cues a voicemail message on his phone, plays it over the speaker. After a BEEP we hear it. A SINISTER MALE VOICE, guttural, taunting, the voice of a DEMON: \nSINISTER MALE VOICE (mocking his earlier line) `It's hard sometimes to tell the truth, but I know you will `cause you're a good little girl...' (THEN; INTIMATE) Twenty years in the trenches, can't make Lieutenant? Hurts, doesn't it? Shakes your faith sometimes. You know why they keep passing you over? Do you, Michael? `Cause you're soft. Soft, soft, soft... \nDELIRIOUS LAUGHTER followed by a CLICK and a DIAL TONE. Emily's mouth gapes. After a moment: \nBARRON You're right. She called Doug. Took me an extra couple of days to get your cell phone records. That's what she's been using. \nGrim pause. Emily digs through her bag. Reaches the bottom. No cell phone. Staring into the bag, voice wavering with EMOTION: \nEMILY She's taking me apart, Mike. \nShe loses it for a second. Barron sits in front of her on the edge of the desk. \nBARRON I'm gonna help you get to the bottom of this. \nEMILY (re: Edward's photo) He told me I have to kill her. \nBarron registers that in silence. Stuns her, and himself, by what he says next. \nBARRON I'll help you. \nEmily looks at him. Disbelief. \nBARRON Whatever it takes. \nShe hugs him. A godsend. \nBARRON I'm gonna put Beth and Tim in a hotel. Keep her at the house. \nINT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY \nEmily buttoning her shirt after an exam. \nDOCTOR Physically you're fine. How's the stress? \nEMILY I'm not sleeping, I was hoping you could give me something. \nThe doctor writes on her prescription pad. \nDOCTOR Take one of these, you'll sleep. \nEmily watches the pen scribble. \nINT. EMILY'S CAR - DAY \nA prescription pill bottle on the passenger seat. Emily, driving home, glances at it with apprehension. \nEXT. HOTEL - NIGHT \nA high-rise hotel in downtown Los Angeles. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nBarron, saying goodbye to his WIFE and SON, sets down the overnight bags they've packed. \nBARRON'S WIFE Why won't you tell me what's going on? \nBARRON Because I can't. \nKisses her. Turns to his son. \nBARRON Take care of your mom. \nMusses the boy's hair and leaves. \nINT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nBarron strides down the corridor, his face reflecting the grim task ahead. \nINT. HOTEL PARKING STRUCTURE - NIGHT \nHis footsteps echo in the parking structure as he walks along a row of parked cars. \nA faint JANGLING SOUND stops him dead in his tracks. He turns and scans the garage behind him. It's quiet, eerily still. \nHe continues onward, but hears the faint JANGLING SOUND again a moment later. Spins, trying to place it. There it is again. Closer this time. Something moving, hiding, behind the rows of cars over there. \nHe bends, trying to get a look under the cars. Can't see anything. Unnerved, he moves on, clicks the button on his keychain remote. The lights flash on his car fifty yards away. \nBut as he continues toward it they reveal themselves, trodding into view from between the cars, CHOKE-CHAIN COLLARS JANGLING around their necks... \nTHREE PIT BULLS \nEmily straightens, turns. It's coming from the \nBED \nAs she approaches it the BUZZING INTENSIFIES, louder, more agitated. \nPauses as she gets there, terrified of what she might find, the bed BUZZING FURIOUSLY FROM WITHIN. Something is trapped under those blankets, waiting for release. \nEmily extends a trembling hand, takes hold of the blankets and, slowly, rigid with fear, peels them back to reveal \nBARE MATTRESS \nImpossible, because the BUZZING IS LOUDER THAN EVER. \nWith a tense swallow Emily realizes it's coming from lower, deeper within the bed, between the mattress and the box spring. \nShe slips her fingers into the crack. \nAnd slowly lifts the mattress, the BUZZING GROWING FRIGHTENINGLY LOUD as its source is exposed, something hellish waiting for her as she cranes her neck and look to see what lies below - \nHER CELL PHONE \nVibrating. BZZZZZZZZZT. BZZZZZZZZZZT. On the viewscreen: \"INCOMING CALL...\" \nShe picks it up. Stares at it vibrating in her hand. Presses the TALK button. Brings it to her ear. \nThe LOW STATIC of an open line. Then, a RASPY MALE VOICE: \nMALE VOICE ON PHONE Emily... \nEmily flinches. \nEMILY Who is this...? \nMALE VOICE ON PHONE It's Wayne, Emily, I just got a call, Mike's dead... \nEmily, stunned, barely able to speak. \nEMILY No... he's... \nWAYNE (V.O.) They don't know if he fell or what happened... \nEmily's phone hand drops to her side in shock. From down there, we hear Wayne's voice: \nWAYNE (V.O.) Emily? Emily, are you okay...? \nAfter a moment, she lifts it. \nEMILY I have to go. \nHangs up. On the brink of emotional collapse. Her only confidante dead. \nJust then she hears BREATHING from behind the open door. Someone or something hiding in that dark corner over there. She crosses to it. Pulls back the door and there sits \nLUCY \nquiet, innocent, chin on her knees. \nEMILY What did you do to him? \nLucy says nothing. Emily grabs her by the arm. Yanks her to her feet. \nEMILY WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM?! \nAfter a moment: \nLUCY He did it to himself. \nWHACK! Emily slaps her. Hard across the face. Knocks her to the floor. Lucy sits up, lip split. Tastes the blood with her tongue. Hint of a smile. The taste of victory. \nLUCY Europa. Ganymede. Io. Callisto. The moons of Jupiter. We got back our astronomy tests today. \nIt's there on the floor. A++ Well done, Lucy! \nThere's a LOUD BEEP in the other room. Lucy gets up and walks out. Emily watches as Lucy goes into the kitchen. Takes a bag of popcorn from the microwave. Empties it into a bowl. Sits down on the living room sofa and clicks on the tv remote, watching it like nothing ever happened. Emily walks over and pitches the tv onto the floor. The SCREEN SHATTERS. \nEMILY Get out of my house. \nLucy, unimpressed, expressionless, takes another handful of popcorn. Chews it. CRUNCH. CRUNCH. CRUNCH. Emily swats the bowl from her hands. \nEMILY GET OUT! \nFlicking bits of popcorn off herself, Lucy stands up from the sofa. Her face catches the light from the hallway. Emily shudders at the sight. \nLucy's features look altered somehow, sharpened. It's subtle, but the overall effect is chilling. THE FACE OF A LITTLE GIRL LAID OVER THE MUSCULATURE OF SOMETHING MORE DEVIOUS AND WICKED. \nLUCY Don't yell at me. My mom and dad used to yell at me. \nstanding on the sidewalk in her pajamas. Unscathed. \nFIRE MARSHALL Anyone else inside?! Yes or no?! \nEmily, in shock, shakes her head no. The Fire Marshall rushes off, walkie-talkie squawking. Emily stands frozen as Lucy comes through the crowd to her. More dismayed than angry. \nLUCY That was mean. \nShe takes Emily's hand. Together they watch the house burn. Firelight playing on their faces. The fish bouncing off the glass in the tank at Emily's feet. \nINT. EMILY'S CAR - NIGHT \nThe blue halflight before dawn. Emily and Lucy sit in the Volvo, eyeing the scorched remains of the house. The firecrew stowing equipment. Emily puts the car in drive. \nINT. EMILY'S CAR - DAWN \nThe FISH FLOATING DEAD at the top of the tank in the back seat as Emily drives down the freeway at daybreak. Lucy gazing out dreamily at the sunrise. \nLUCY Maybe we can find a hotel with a swimming pool. \nEmily says nothing. Lucy turns and looks at her, thoughtful, almost empathetic. She draws up her knees and rests her chin on top, levels an appraising stare at Emily like the one she leveled at Doug. \nLUCY It's sad, isn't it? How it gets passed on. How people do to their own kids what their parents did to them. That's why you got the job... \nEmily turns on the radio, full volume, trying to drown out Lucy's voice. Lucy reaches over and turns it off. CLICK. \nLUCY ...To prove to yourself you're not like her, that you're not like your mother. Because that scares you. Scares you more than anything. \nLucy, in mock sentiment, puts her hand on Emily's. \nLUCY I love you... even if you don't love me. \nEmily looks at her, gutted. But defiant. Turning her gaze forward, she tightens her grip on the wheel and calmly, resolutely, JAMS THE GAS PEDAL TO THE FLOOR. The acceleration pitches Lucy backwards into her seat. She sits up, eyes wide, didn't see this coming. A suicide run. \nLUCY What are you doing? Slow down. \nA tense smile from Lucy. The tables have turned. \nLUCY Did you hear me? \nEmily stares dead ahead, red-lining the tachometer. Lucy flits her eyes skyward. IMMEDIATELY IT DARKENS AND STARTS TO RAIN. Emily turns on the wipers, speeds on, unfazed. \nLUCY I said slow down! \nEmily ignores her, going eighty now, weaving through SLOWER TRAFFIC THAT FLIES TOWARD THEM OUT OF THE GRAY HAZE. Lucy, panicking, changes channels like a tv. Innocent child all of a sudden. \nLUCY Please, stop, Emily, I'll be good. \nEmily ignores her, beyond apology. And Lucy's face sharpens. She points down the road. \nLUCY Look out! \nThrough the heavy rain we see - \nA TRACTOR-TRAILER RIG CRASH THROUGH THE DIVIDING MEDIAN AND JACKKNIFE, BARRELING AT THEM HEAD-ON! \nEmily goes for the brake, but reconsiders, seeing the truck for what it is: a test of faith. She welcomes it. Tightens her grip on the wheel and goes full throttle again, right at the truck. Lucy shrieks in terror. \nLUCY What are you doing?! \nEMILY It's not real. \nLUCY Yes, it is! \nEMILY Are you scared?! \nPedal to the floor. Inviting the head-on collision. You can see the BIG RIG DRIVER in the cab, wrestling frantically with the steering wheel. Lucy bracing herself, screams - \nLUCY STOP! \nEmily clenches her teeth in anticipation of impact, of death. \nTHE CHROME GRILLWORK OF THE TRUCK RUSHES TOWARD THEM IN THAT FINAL MOMENT, THE AIR HORN DEAFENINGLY LOUD! \nBut the impact never comes. In the blink of an eye the truck is gone. Open road in front of them. It's not raining. Never was. The wipers SQUEAKING on a dry windshield. \nLucy sits in silence, her bag of tricks empty. Emily, triumphant, turns to her with a vindictive smile, the speedometer hitting a hundred. \nEMILY ARE YOU SCARED?! \nShe clutches Lucy's wrist. \nEMILY I'M NOT!! \nEmily jerks the car off the road, crashing through the guardrail. Trees snapping in half across the hood as they go careening through roadside woods and down a steep embankment TOWARD - \nEXT. LOS ANGELES RESERVOIR - DAY \n", "test1_input": "Nice moment for Emily. A rare triumph. She tucks Lucy in. Turns off the bedside light. \nEMILY I'm right down the hall if you need me. \nLucy settles. Emily pauses at the door, looks back at the lost child she's taken in, then closes the door halfway. \nEXT. SHERIDAN HOUSE - DAY \nDark, abandoned. Emily's Volvo pulls up. \nINT. EMILY'S CAR - DAY \nShe eyes the house. It haunts her, the memory of what happened. \nA SUDDEN KNOCK on the window makes her jump out of her seat. The guy there gestures a friendly sorry, didn't mean to scare you. White shirt and tie. A COURT CLERK. \nEXT. SHERIDAN HOUSE - DAY \nEmily signs a form as he unlocks the door, letting her in. \nEMILY I have to grab some of her things, might take me a minute. \nCOURT CLERK I trust ya, Em, make sure you lock it on the way out. \nINT. SHERIDAN HOUSE - DAY \nEmily closes the door, glances around the dark interior. Through a window she sees the Court Clerk drive off. She's alone. It's quiet, eerily still. \nShe goes up the stairway. Slows, noticing something on the WALL - \nA FAINT SQUARE where a picture once was hung, the wallpaper a half tone darker underneath. More SQUARES farther up. A few nails still sticking out. \nINT. LUCY'S BEDROOM, SHERIDAN HOUSE - DAY \nTattered lace curtains sway in a draft beside a bed with a moth-eaten coverlet. Emily packs Lucy's spare clothes into a dufflebag. Zips it and walks out. \nINT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY \nExiting Lucy's room, she notes the door to Edward and Margaret's bedroom, at the far end of the hall, is slightly AJAR. Succumbs to a natural curiosity. \nINT. EDWARD AND MARGARET'S BEDROOM - DAY \nThe door pushes open, Emily peering in. A sad little master bedroom with old floral printed wallpaper and water stains on the ceiling. \nShe explores the room, inspecting various personal items - aftershave, glasses, hair brush - looking for clues to their madness. \nAn ALARM CLOCK with a cracked crystal face. She picks it up and it GOES OFF in her hand. Gives her a scare. She puts it down. Sees something out the bedroom window. Steps closer. Parts the curtains. \nIn the backyard, by the garden shed, a long rectangular hole has been dug. A SHALLOW GRAVE filling with leaves. Edward's handiwork. Emily's seen enough, heads for the door. \nBut slows, noticing something odd as she comes back around the bed - \nA LONG DEEP SCRATCH \nin the wooden floor, hidden under a long runner rug. Emily peels back the rug and finds - \nHUNDREDS OF LONG DEEP SCRATCHES \nin the floorboards leading toward the door. Something - the old oak bureau perhaps? - has been dragged repeatedly across the room. \nEmily comes over and looks behind the door and sees, on the back of it, something even more bizarre - \nTWO MASSIVE DEADBOLTS \nscrewed hastily, crookedly, into the wood. She closes the door. Slides-to the big heavy bolts - \nCLUNK. \nCLUNK. \nPauses. Looks again at the bureau. Slides it in front of the door, a wheelless caster bracket leaving another long scratch in the hardwood. And it's clear at this point what the deadbolts and bureau add up to - \nA BARRICADE \nEmily stares at it. Looks over at Edward and Margaret's bed, imagining them here behind this door. Slides the bureau aside. Opens the deadbolts. And as the door swings open she is looking straight down the hall at \nLUCY'S BEDROOM \nEmily stares, bewildered. \nINT. GROUP THERAPY ROOM - DAY \nABUSED CHILDREN aged eight to thirteen sit in a circle of folding chairs. Lucy among them. Diego. Doug facilitating. \nDOUG Sometimes when our parents aren't getting along it's better if they don't see each other for a while, that's what a `restraining order' does... \nINT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GROUP THERAPY - DAY \n", "test1_true": "TIME CUT TO: \nEmily and Doug walk together after session. Lucy talking to other kids her age by the elevator. \nDOUG She's starting to come out of her shell. It's good, I just wish I thought it was me making the difference. \nEmily accepts the compliment. \nEMILY I went by the house. I think her mom and dad were barricading themselves in their room at night. How sick is that? \nDOUG Hatred and fear are part of the same pathology - oh, but I forgot, you don't think they're crazy. \nEMILY I'm coming around. \nAs they part ways... \nINT. EMILY'S CAR - DAY \nEmily pulls up in front of Lucy's school. Big moment for Lucy. New clothes. New haircut. New life. \nEMILY Okay? \nLucy nods, apprehensive, but she's ready to face it. Emily hugs her. \nEMILY This is your new beginning. \nLucy gets out. Pauses on the sidewalk. \nLUCY I love you, Emily. \nEmily, touched, smiles. \nEMILY I love you, too. \nLucy goes up the walk. Emily watches her safely into the building. \nINT. CHILD SERVICES DEPARTMENT - DAY \nEmily draws grim looks as she crosses the common area. A pall hanging over the entire department. The first person she walks past says: \nCOWORKER Wayne's looking for you. \nThe second person: \nCOWORKER #2 Wayne wants to -- \nEMILY Got it. \nShe comes past Wayne's office. Empty. A coworker points over toward Emily's cubicle - he's there. She goes over. Wayne's inside, grave-faced, looking for a file. He finds it on the shelf. A photo of eight-year-old DIEGO clipped inside the cover. The boy we met earlier. \nEMILY What's up with Diego? \nWayne hesitates, wanting to spare her the bad news. \nWAYNE Why don't we talk in my office. \nEMILY Tell me what's going on. \nWAYNE We don't know why yet, but... he killed his mother and father last night. \nEmily stands there, jaw on the floor. \nEXT. MARTINEZ HOUSE - DAY \nA police perimeter around a small house in a tough low-income neighborhood. Cops and crime scene investigators on the scene. Local news media broadcasting live. A couple of news choppers hovering overhead. \nEmily pulls up, jumps out of her car. Mike Barron waves off the uniformed officer who moves to intercept her as she comes up the walkway to the house. \nEMILY What happened? \nBARRON Sure you want to see this? \nWith an uncertain nod she follows him inside. \nINT. MARTINEZ HOUSE - DAY \nEmily and Mike Barron come along the uncarpeted hallway. \nBARRON Gets a tire iron from the garage, comes back inside, locks all the doors and windows, kills them in their sleep... \nThe master bedroom. A bloodbath. \nBARRON Had to use dental records to identify the bodies. \nEmily looks around, aghast. \n", "test1_id": 1179, "test2_input": "After hours, the office is empty, half lit and eerily still. Emily is photocopying at a work station, haunted by what Diego said, the harsh upward light accentuating her tense features. \nThe CYCLICAL SQUEAKING NOISE we hear is Lucy, in Emily's cubicle in the b.g., turning herself in circles on the office chair. Something very creepy about the disappearance and reappearance of that pale watchful face. \nFinished, Emily walks back to her cubicle, thrown by the sight of Lucy spinning in the chair, walking head-on into that eerie intermittent gaze. \nLUCY Do... (TURNS) you... (TURNS) like... (TURNS) working... (TURNS) here? \nEmily, unnerved, enters the cubicle. \nEMILY Well, photocopying isn't much fun. \nLucy stops turning, stares at her, sensing something. \nEMILY What...? \nLucy just stares. Doug appears in the doorway. \nDOUG Knock, knock. Sorry I'm late, guys. (TO LUCY) Ready, kiddo? \nLucy nods and gets up from the chair. \nDOUG Go ahead down, I'll be right there. \nLucy heads down the hall to the conference room. \nDOUG (TO EMILY) You all right? \nEMILY This is weird. Diego said it was Lucy that called, but he called her a he, he said it was a man. \nHis face - what? Emily nods yes. Doug's brow arches then furrows. He turns and heads down the hall. \nINT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT \nDoug sits opposite Lucy at the table, keeps it easygoing despite what he's just been told. \nDOUG So how's school? \nLUCY Fine. \nDOUG Any of your classmates giving you a hard time? \nLUCY No, they've been nice. \nDOUG Sleeping okay? \nLUCY That's not really what you want to talk about, is it, Doug? \nAwkward pause. Awkward smile. \nDOUG You got me. \nOpens his file. Takes out her cognitive assessment profile. Lays it flat on the table. \nDOUG Question 16a, are you afraid of the dark? You answered `no'. Question 16b, are you afraid of being alone? `No'. 16c, are afraid of your parents? `No'. You answered `no' to everything in that section. I think some of those should have been yesses. Everybody is afraid of something. Working through our fears, conquering them, is how we get better. So I want you to tell me... What scares you? \nLucy steeples her fingers and rests her chin on top, regards Doug with a look of frank appraisal. It is the face of a child, but behind those eyes there is a keen intelligence. \nLUCY I'll tell you what scares me if you tell me what scares you. \nDoug did not see this coming. \nDOUG Fair enough. When I was twelve I was climbing a tree and I accidentally put my hand through a giant hornets' nest. They didn't like it. I got stung over a hundred times. They had to rush me to the hospital. I've been afraid of hornets ever since. Don't climb many trees either. (SMILES) Everybody has fears. Now, what scares you? \nLUCY Me. \nPause. \nDOUG You scare yourself? \nLUCY Sometimes. \nDOUG Why, what about yourself scares you? \nLUCY I have bad thoughts. \nDOUG About what? \nLUCY People. \nDOUG People in general or certain people? \nLUCY Certain people. \nDOUG Like who? \nLUCY You. \n", "test2_true": "DOUG You have bad thoughts about me? (SHE NODS) Why? \nLUCY (SHRUGS) I just do. \nDOUG Was there something I said or did that upset you? \nLUCY (shakes her head) It's just the way you are... \nDOUG How am I? \nLUCY Facile. \nDOUG Facile? (she nods yes) Do you even know what that means? \nLUCY Easily comprehended. Often lacking sincerity or depth. You're smug, too. Want me to tell you what that means? \nDead silence. Doug skewered by a ten-year-old. A boyish shyness emerges, a relic from his own youth. \nDOUG Well, if, um, if I seemed `smug' or `facile' I want to - \nLUCY (GIRLISH LAUGH) Don't apologize. \nDOUG Why? \nLUCY You're a grown up, it's embarrassing. (THEN; DEADPAN) (MORE) \nLUCY(CONT'D) Should we talk about school now? My grades are getting a lot better. \nDoug just stares at her. \nINT. HALLWAY, CHILD SERVICES DEPARTMENT - NIGHT \nWaiting until Lucy is out of earshot down the hall, Doug confers with Emily by the water cooler. He's sweating, shaken by the encounter. \nDOUG Talked to a lot of ten-year-olds, I don't think I've ever felt like that before... \nEMILY Like what? \nDOUG Threatened. (THEN; BAFFLED) I know a specialist, I'll call him in the morning. \nEMILY What do I do with her in the meantime? \nDoug pauses, no idea, smiles an eerie smile. \nDOUG Don't let her get in your head. \nExits. His paranoia feeding Emily's. In the hush she hears that faint CYCLICAL SQUEAKING. Looks across the darkened office to her cubicle where Lucy is turning circles in her chair again. \nThat face. That face. That face. \nINT. EMILY'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nTense dinner. Emily barely touching hers. Lucy, absently, but with an almost surgical precision, is CUTTING PEAS IN HALF ON HER PLATE AND EATING THEM ONE BY ONE OFF THE TIP OF THE KNIFE. Weird. She stops, self-conscious, looks at Emily across the table. \nLUCY Are you mad at me? \nEMILY No. Just tired. \nLUCY Want me to brush your hair? \nEMILY That's okay. \nLUCY Are you sure? \nEMILY Some other time. \nLUCY (STANDS UP) It will make you feel better. I'll get the brush. \nEMILY I said no, thank you. \nLucy stares at Emily for a moment then sits again. And it's strange, her posture seems subtly different, stiffer, bonier, as if all her muscles have drawn taut under her clothes. In a voice at once innocent and menacing: \nLUCY Doug said something, didn't he? \nEMILY No. Doug? He says you're doing great. \nTense silence. \nLUCY What did he tell you? \nEMILY Nothing. \nLucy stares at her, seeing through the facade. Then, oddly bright, taking a bite of food: \nLUCY You're funny. \n", "test2_id": 1180, "test3_input": "SINISTER MALE VOICE ...until it's too late. \nA HAND reaches down and picks it up, a girl's hand, but the fingers as they wrap tightly around the handle look strong and sinewy. \nThe feet stand motionless for a moment then turn and come toward the bed, stopping right in front of EMILY'S HORRIFIED FACE. \nA pause and then, still from Emily's POV, we see Lucy lower herself onto her knees. \nWHAM!! - with shocking force that hand IMPALES THE SCREWDRIVER IN THE WOODEN FLOOR! \nAnother pause then both hands come into view, palms flat on the hardwood, as she leans her head down. \nEmily recoiling in anticipation as the face comes into view - \nLUCY'S INNOCENT FACE \nA little girl. With a little girl voice to match. \nLUCY (PLAYING MOMMY) What are you doing, you silly pumpkinhead? \nEmily, hyperventilating, stares in shock. Lucy reaches her hand in. Emily backs away, wedges herself in the corner. \nLUCY (PLAYING MOMMY) You don't want me to come under there and get you, do you? \nEmily, crying now, shakes her head. Lucy, almost sympathetic, frowns. \nLUCY (PLAYING MOMMY) I'm going to count to three. One... \nEMILY No... \nLUCY (PLAYING MOMMY) Two... Two and a half... \nEMILY Please... \nLUCY (PLAYING MOMMY) Two and three quarters... Three... \nLucy starts crawling under the bed. \nLUCY Here I come. \nEmily tries to go backwards, but there's nowhere for her to go. \nLUCY'S FACE SLIDING CLOSER LIKE THE HEAD OF A SNAKE. \nTrapped, Emily screams. \nEMILY WHAT DO YOU WANT?!! \nLucy stops crawling. Folds her arms, sets her chin on them. Comfortable here under the bed. Delighting in the question. \nLUCY What you wanted from your mother. I want you to love me. \nEMILY Okay... okay, I will, I will, I promise. \nLucy weighs Emily's surrender for a moment. Then, oddly BRIGHT: \nLUCY Come tuck me in. \nEMILY Okay... I'll be right there. \nLUCY You better come. \nLucy slithers out and we see her feet scamper from the room. Emily puts her head down on the floor and cries, covering her mouth with her hands so she won't make a sound. \nINT. EMILY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT \nA WHISTLING KETTLE on the stove. \nEmily, still in tears, takes it from the burner. Dumps SIX SLEEPING PILLS from the prescription bottle. Crushes them with the blunt edge of a knife. Stirs them into a cup of Chamomile tea. \nShe freezes at a NOISE behind her. Looks tensely over her shoulder. \nThe fridge. \nShe adds sugar, continues stirring. \nINT. HALLWAY - NIGHT \nWe follow the TEA CUP, in Emily's hand, as she comes nervously down the hall to Lucy's room. We can see Lucy in there, waiting for her in bed. Emily, playing the part, dries her eyes and enters. \nINT. LUCY'S ROOM - NIGHT \nSits down on the bed, hands Lucy the tea. \nLUCY Chamomile. \nEmily nods. The face of a loving mother. Lucy brings the cup to her lips, pauses. \n", "test3_true": "EMILY I'll have one later. \nLucy considers this, nods okay, takes a sip of tea. Emily picks up a brush and brushes Lucy's hair. \nEMILY Tomorrow's our new beginning. \nLUCY I'll be good. \nEMILY I know. \nLucy takes a few more sips and sets the tea cup on the bedside table. Emily, tucking her in, gives the cup a nervous glance. Did she drink enough? \nEMILY Get some rest. \nLUCY Say it. \nEMILY I love you. \nLUCY Forever and ever? \nEMILY Forever and ever. \nEmily kisses her on the forehead. Lucy looks up at her and for a moment she's the little girl Emily met. Innocent, angelic, closing her eyes for sleep. They flutter open one last time. \nLUCY Where are you if I need you? \nEMILY Right down the hall. \nLucy's eyes shut. Emily, brushing her hair, staring at the HALF-FULL TEA CUP. \nINT. HALLWAY - NIGHT \nLucy asleep in bed. Emily watches from the door, wary, expecting Lucy's eyes to snap open any second. \nEMILY Sweetheart...? \nShe doesn't move, dead to the world. Or is it a game? Emily closes the door. Leans against the wall, shaking, contemplating her next move. \nWedges a chair under the door handle. Time of the essence. \nINT. EMILY'S GARAGE - NIGHT \nJunk-filled. The door lifts to reveal Emily, silhouetted, looking in. Amid the clutter is a lawnmower. Beside it, a big can of GASOLINE. \nINT. EMILY'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nEmily stifling sobs as she douses the walls of the house. The hallway, the bathroom, the kitchen, all of it. \nTIP OF A MATCH strikes flint, ignites. \nEmily stares at it for a long moment. \nLets it fall. \nFLAMES SCURRY in a shimmering blue-gold sheet across the floor. Climb the walls, the entire house ablaze in a matter of seconds. \nEmily sits and watches as the door to Lucy's bedroom is engulfed. It's an image straight from hell: A YOUNG WOMAN SITTING ON A SOFA IN A HOUSE OF FIRE. \nThe fish, frantic in their tank, catch Emily's eye. She goes over and grabs the tank. \nEXT. EMILY'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nSmoke swirling past her, she exits the house, locking the front door behind her. She backs away and watches it burn, holding her fish tank, the only thing she saved. \nTIME CUT TO: \nBillowing black smoke. The house fully engulfed as fire engines arriving on the scene, sirens wailing. Emily watching with neighbors on the sidewalk as the FIREFIGHTERS uncoil their hoses. \nThe window to Lucy's bedroom is a bright red square, an inferno. And as Emily stares at it, disbelieving what she's done, the figure of a CHILD appears. \nLUCY \nHer whole body ablaze. Horrific. She just stands there, arms at her sides, burning. \nJust now the FIRE MARSHALL crosses to the onlookers. Hollers over the noise and commotion: \nFIRE MARSHALL Everybody get out okay?! \nEmily wavers, not sure what to say. The Fire Marshall sees her indecision. \nFIRE MARSHALL This your house?! (she nods yes) Anybody else inside?! (off her hesitation) Ma'am...?! \nEmily opens her mouth to reply, but sees something behind her that closes her throat. \nLUCY \n", "test3_id": 1181}

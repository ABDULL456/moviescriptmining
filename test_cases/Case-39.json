{"test1_input": "EMILY An eight-year-old did this? There's no way. \nBARRON I was there when they brought him in. Took three guys my size to subdue him. Kid was climbing the walls. \nBarron turns to the window and - WHAM! - AN ATTACK DOG HITS THE GLASS RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIS FACE. Barron recoils with a yelp. Then, embarrassed, eyes the TRIO OF BATTLE-SCARRED PIT BULLS prowling the chainlink-fenced backyard. \nBARRON Just your average American family. \nEXT. MARTINEZ HOUSE - DAY \nEmily and Barron come down the steps. \nEMILY Where is he now? \nBARRON Juvie lockup. And, no, I'm not taking you to see him. \nEMILY You want to know what happened? \nBARRON I know what happened. \nEMILY I don't. I need to talk to him. Mike, please, I care about this kid. \nINT. JUVENILE DETENTION CENTER - DAY \nDiego Martinez sitting alone in a holding cell. Confused. Scared. He sees Emily approaching and immediately breaks down. \nEMILY Diego... \nEmily tells the cop at the cell door: \nEMILY Let me in. He won't hurt me. \nThe cop looks at Mike Barron who nods it's okay. The cop opens the cell. Emily enters. Diego looks up at her, shuddering with emotion: \nDIEGO Are they dead? \nEmily, gutted, nods yes. Diego buries his face in Emily's stomach and sobs. \nEMILY What happened? Tell me what happened. \nDIEGO (SOBBING) I killed my mum and dad... \nEmily, devastated, trades looks with Barron through the bars. \nEXT. VENICE PIER - DAY \nDoug tenderly consoles Emily. Has his arms around her. They're leaning against the railing, wind on their faces. \nDOUG Every family you sit down with every day of every week is a family in crisis. Those are your odds. That's the job you do. Trying to beat them. \nWipes away her tears. The hair from her face. \nDOUG You're one person, Em. You can't save the world. (THEN) I know somebody you did save. \nLucy on the beach below, walking barefoot at water's edge, hem of her dress in her hands. Emily watches her and, finding solace in it, leans into Doug's embrace and closes her eyes. \nEXT. BEACH - DAY \nThe plaintive cries of seagulls overhead as Emily and Lucy walk along the surf at sundown, Emily barefoot now as well. \nLUCY You okay? \nEmily nods, putting on a brave face to spare Lucy. \nEMILY It's just work. Don't worry. \nLucy nods okay. They walk on in silence for a moment. \nLUCY Why do you do it if it makes you sad? \nEMILY My job? I don't know, I guess... I guess maybe I want to believe families can work, so I can have my own someday, I don't know - does that make sense? \nLucy nods, takes her hand. They walk off up the beach together. \nINT. EMILY'S HOUSE - DAY \nEmily, days later, dressed for work, halves an omelet with a spatula and slides the halves onto two plates. \nEMILY (calls to other room) Breakfast. \nThere's no answer. Emily goes to get her. \nINT. LUCY'S ROOM - DAY \nStops in the doorway. \nEMILY Honey, breakfa-- \n", "test1_true": "EMILY Come on, let me see... \nLucy guiltily eyes the floor. Emily lifts the pillow. Underneath it is a photograph. \nEMILY, AS A YOUNG GIRL, WITH HER MOTHER. \nShe looks at Lucy, then at the filing cabinet from which it was taken. More surprised than upset. \nEMILY You went through my things? \nLUCY I'm sorry... I wanted to know what happened to you. \nDisarming sincerity. Emily's gaze falls to the photo. Quiet moment. She sits down on the bed with it. \nLUCY Is that your mom? \nEmily nods, lost in the image. It's a photo that captures her entire childhood. Emily and her mother sitting on the steps of a house, together but apart, like a lost child that sat down next to a pretty stranger who hasn't yet noticed her. Emily's ten-year-old face shows the quiet sadness of the disconnect. Reminds you of a child from her caseload. \nEMILY She used to just leave, she'd just... (GESTURES `ADIOS') ...and I never knew when she was coming back, or if she was... I used to think it was my fault and I would try so hard when she got home to be good, do everything I could think of, so she'd think I was `special' and stay next time or take me with her, but... it didn't matter, she'd always go away again, that's how it was. \nEmily fights her emotions and, practiced at the task, wins. Lucy sits beside her on the bed. Understands her deeply. Linked by their pasts. \nLUCY Where was your dad? \nEMILY Gone, he left before I was born. First time I met him I was like thirteen. \nLUCY What'd you say to him? \nEMILY Oh, I had all these things I was gonna say. Angry things I'd thought of and kind of memorized. And um.... And then I met him and I wasn't angry, I was just sad and I told him... (pauses, raw emotion) I said, I love you, even if you don't love me. \nEmily smiles a pained smile and then buries the memory. Lucy, a portrait of contrition: \nLUCY Are you mad at me? \nEMILY No... No, I'm not mad at you. (puts her arm around her) But I need you not to do that again, okay? Go through my private things without asking? \nLucy nods okay. Emily moves on, with a loving touch: \nEMILY Omelet's getting cold. Better hurry. \nLucy exits. Emily eyes the photo a moment longer then stands and puts it away in the filing cabinet. She pauses, feeling exposed, and turns the little key to lock the drawers. \nINT. EMILY'S CUBICLE - DAY \nEmily stops at her cubicle, registering a surprise. Wayne handing her case files to three COWORKERS. Awkward moment for everyone. \nWAYNE (SYMPATHETIC) I need another set of eyes to go over them, make sure we haven't missed anything else. \nEMILY You mean, to make sure I haven't missed anything else? \nWAYNE It's just a legal thing. You'll have them back tomorrow. \nThey exit. She goes in and stares at the BARE SHELF above her desk. Her caseload gone. More than an insult. Everything she cares about. \nA pink phone message on her keyboard. She picks it up: Mike Barron called. Important. \nINT. COFFEE HOUSE - DAY \nNewspaper headline: \"INSANITY DEFENSE FOR GLENDALE COUPLE\". MUGSHOTS of Edward and Margaret below. The morning edition folded on a table between Barron and Emily. They're drinking coffee. \nBARRON You watch, six months, their lawyer will hire some expert to say they're rehabbed and they'll sue for custody when they get out. \nEMILY She's not going back there, I'll take her out of state before I let them near her again. \nBARRON I didn't hear you say that. \nEmily knows she's misspoken, but lets it stand. \nEMILY You wanted to talk about something? \nBarron nods, sips his coffee, a bit uncomfortable. \nBARRON We pulled the Martinezes' phone records. They got a call that night before the murders. \nEMILY From who? \nBARRON (SOBER PAUSE) Emily, the call came from your house. \nEMILY What...? \nBARRON Look, I'm not accusing you of anything, I just need to know what was said. \nEMILY That's impossible. I might have called the week before...? \nBARRON I'm talking to you as a friend here, you know that, right? \n", "test1_id": 1179, "test2_input": "- and to the shock of the other PARENTS waiting outside. Nancy comes after her in a fury. Runs her down. Erupts. \nNANCY Who do you think you are barging in there like that?! \nEMILY I don't want her in group anymore, I don't want her around the other kids. \nNANCY Well that's not your decision, is it?! \nEmily opens her mouth to reply, but Lucy beats her to the punch. \nLUCY It's okay, Nancy, Emily's been under a lot of stress lately, but she's really nice to me and I hope I can stay with her a really long time. \nNancy, disarmed by the glowing praise, turns back to Emily. \nNANCY We'll talk about this later. \nStorms off. \nLUCY See you next week, Nancy. \nNancy doesn't hear, busily reassuring parents, damage control. Emily and Lucy arrive at the elevator. Emily hits the button. \nEMILY You're never going back there. \nLUCY Why, Emily? \nEmily says nothing. Lucy keeps asking the same question, in the exact same intonation, as Emily ignores her: \nLUCY Why, Emily? Why, Emily? Why, Emily? \nDING. The doors open. \nINT. ELEVATOR - DAY \nEmily and Lucy step in. The door closes. Lucy continuing her verbal assault as they start to descend: \nLUCY Why, Emily? Why, Emily? \nSuddenly the ELEVATOR LURCHES TO A VIOLENT STOP. It buckles Emily's knees. She is terrified, practically hyperventilating. \nEMILY W-w-what's happening - ?! \nLucy has gotten her attention. \nLUCY Can I go back to group next week? \nEMILY You're never going back there! \nLucy looks at her as one regards a small dumb animal. Then looks up at the ceiling. \nLUCY Are you sure? \nHorror as Emily realizes what she's thinking. We hear the first CABLE SNAP above them. In the CREAKING HUSH that FOLLOWS: \nEMILY No... \nThe second CABLE SNAPS. The elevator goes into a HELLISH FREE FALL. \nThe acceleration is dizzying. \nEmily clutches the rail with both hands, SCREAMING as the elevator goes cannonballing down the shaft. Lucy indifferent as they plummet toward certain death. \nThe floor indicator light races toward L, the car shuddering violently, the noise deafening. It's a horrible way to die. \nEmily closes her eyes in anticipation of impact. And in the sudden BLACKNESS there's no noise at all. Just a soft, DISTINCT \nDING. \nA breathless pause then Emily opens her eyes. And sees the elevator is no longer falling. Never was. The doors glide open to the first floor lobby. \nLucy gives her a quiet look and strolls out. A businessman steps into the elevator, watching bewildered as Emily releases her white-knuckled grip on the railing and staggers out, so badly shaken she can barely stand... \nINT. EMILY'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nFish swim languidly in the tank. It's after midnight. We're looking down the darkened hall at Emily's closed bedroom door. \nINT. EMILY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nEmily, in a coat and shoes, packing a suitcase. Snaps it quietly shut. Looks over at the barricaded door. Draws a tense breath. \nINT. HALLWAY - NIGHT \nFrom down the hall we hear the DEADBOLTS SLIDE QUIETLY OPEN. \nThe door opens a crack. \nEMILY'S TERRIFIED FACE peers out. Making sure the hall is empty. \n", "test2_true": "Tiptoes down the hall. Quietly as possible as she comes past Lucy's door. It's open a crack. The room pitch black inside. Emily steps closer, breath held. Peers in through the little crack. Sees - \nLUCY ASLEEP IN BED. \nBut suddenly her EYES SNAP OPEN. Her face horizontal on the pillow. \nLUCY I can see you. \nEmily backs away. Goes quickly to the front door. \nINT. EMILY'S CAR - NIGHT \nEmily throws the suitcase in the trunk. Slams it shut. Comes around to the driver's side door. Jumps in. Closes the door. And gets the scare of her life. \nLUCY IS SITTING IN THE PASSENGER SEAT! \nEmily recoils with a SCREAM, throwing her body against the window behind her. Lucy sits there, silent, betrayed. \nIt's too much for Emily. She breaks down. Buries her face in her hands and sobs. \nLucy, after a moment, takes a brush from Emily's bag and starts lovingly brushing her hair. \nEmily slowly lifts her head, resigning herself to this latest horror. She sits zombie-like behind the wheel, tears streaming as Lucy tugs gently at the snarls, playing mommy. \nLUCY Don't be sad. This is your new beginning. \nINT. EMILY'S CUBICLE - DAY \nUnopened mail and new case files piling up. Emily looks terrible, phone to ear, getting SCREAMED at, sworn at, interrupted every time she tries to speak. \nEMILY Mrs Lynch, I told you - will you let - that's not what I said - no, I did not - you never sent me the - Mrs Lynch - will you let me respond? - will you let me - Mrs Lynch - will you let - \nEmily can't take it anymore. She unloads. \nEMILY SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU MISERABLE MISERABLE WOMAN BEFORE I GET IN MY CAR AND COME OVER THERE AND BEAT YOUR ASS LIKE YOU BEAT YOUR SON! I HAVE YOUR ADDRESS! THINK ABOUT THAT NEXT TIME YOU CALL AND SWEAR AT ME! I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE! \nSlams the phone down. Sits there looking rather dazed. Wayne arrives, dazed in a different way, having overheard. \nWAYNE Um, so, I notice you haven't taken any personal days. Come on, you look like crap, go home. \nEmily levels a withering stare. \nEMILY I don't want to go home. \nEXT. LOS ANGELES APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY \nEmily knocking on a door in an outside hallway. It opens. It's the girl from the bar. BECCA. The friend. Not expecting her. \nBECCA Emily... \nINT. BECCA'S APARTMENT - DAY \nEmily, disheveled, five days without sleep, doing her best to appear rational. \nEMILY I know I haven't been a great friend lately, but... do you think maybe I could crash here for a couple of nights? \nBECCA Sure, when? \nEMILY Tonight and tomorrow. \nBecca draws air through her teeth, pained by her predicament. \nBECCA Em, any other weekend you know I'd say yes, but I just met this guy and he's coming over tonight like for the night and it might be, you know, kinda weird. \nEmily nods. And there's nothing more to be said. \nINT. EMILY'S ROOM - NIGHT \nStormy night. Heavy rain. High winds. The trees, thrashing outside the window, backlit by a streetlight, cast OMINOUS SHADOWS on the walls of the bedroom. \nEmily huddles in the corner, wrapped in a blanket, clutching the screwdriver. \nThere is a KNOCK on the bedroom door. Emily's EYES JERK WIDE OPEN. She looks at the door, but doesn't answer. \nAfter a moment, Lucy's voice, innocent, afraid - \nLUCY (O.S.) Emily...? Can I come in? I'm scared... \nEmily says nothing. Heart racing. There's another KNOCK. A little louder. \nLUCY (O.S.) Emily? Please? I know you're in there, please...? \nEmily says nothing. Lucy starts pounding on the door. \nLUCY (O.S.) Please, Emily... \n", "test2_id": 1180, "test3_input": "Emily straightens, turns. It's coming from the \nBED \nAs she approaches it the BUZZING INTENSIFIES, louder, more agitated. \nPauses as she gets there, terrified of what she might find, the bed BUZZING FURIOUSLY FROM WITHIN. Something is trapped under those blankets, waiting for release. \nEmily extends a trembling hand, takes hold of the blankets and, slowly, rigid with fear, peels them back to reveal \nBARE MATTRESS \nImpossible, because the BUZZING IS LOUDER THAN EVER. \nWith a tense swallow Emily realizes it's coming from lower, deeper within the bed, between the mattress and the box spring. \nShe slips her fingers into the crack. \nAnd slowly lifts the mattress, the BUZZING GROWING FRIGHTENINGLY LOUD as its source is exposed, something hellish waiting for her as she cranes her neck and look to see what lies below - \nHER CELL PHONE \nVibrating. BZZZZZZZZZT. BZZZZZZZZZZT. On the viewscreen: \"INCOMING CALL...\" \nShe picks it up. Stares at it vibrating in her hand. Presses the TALK button. Brings it to her ear. \nThe LOW STATIC of an open line. Then, a RASPY MALE VOICE: \nMALE VOICE ON PHONE Emily... \nEmily flinches. \nEMILY Who is this...? \nMALE VOICE ON PHONE It's Wayne, Emily, I just got a call, Mike's dead... \nEmily, stunned, barely able to speak. \nEMILY No... he's... \nWAYNE (V.O.) They don't know if he fell or what happened... \nEmily's phone hand drops to her side in shock. From down there, we hear Wayne's voice: \nWAYNE (V.O.) Emily? Emily, are you okay...? \nAfter a moment, she lifts it. \nEMILY I have to go. \nHangs up. On the brink of emotional collapse. Her only confidante dead. \nJust then she hears BREATHING from behind the open door. Someone or something hiding in that dark corner over there. She crosses to it. Pulls back the door and there sits \nLUCY \nquiet, innocent, chin on her knees. \nEMILY What did you do to him? \nLucy says nothing. Emily grabs her by the arm. Yanks her to her feet. \nEMILY WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM?! \nAfter a moment: \nLUCY He did it to himself. \nWHACK! Emily slaps her. Hard across the face. Knocks her to the floor. Lucy sits up, lip split. Tastes the blood with her tongue. Hint of a smile. The taste of victory. \nLUCY Europa. Ganymede. Io. Callisto. The moons of Jupiter. We got back our astronomy tests today. \nIt's there on the floor. A++ Well done, Lucy! \nThere's a LOUD BEEP in the other room. Lucy gets up and walks out. Emily watches as Lucy goes into the kitchen. Takes a bag of popcorn from the microwave. Empties it into a bowl. Sits down on the living room sofa and clicks on the tv remote, watching it like nothing ever happened. Emily walks over and pitches the tv onto the floor. The SCREEN SHATTERS. \nEMILY Get out of my house. \nLucy, unimpressed, expressionless, takes another handful of popcorn. Chews it. CRUNCH. CRUNCH. CRUNCH. Emily swats the bowl from her hands. \nEMILY GET OUT! \nFlicking bits of popcorn off herself, Lucy stands up from the sofa. Her face catches the light from the hallway. Emily shudders at the sight. \nLucy's features look altered somehow, sharpened. It's subtle, but the overall effect is chilling. THE FACE OF A LITTLE GIRL LAID OVER THE MUSCULATURE OF SOMETHING MORE DEVIOUS AND WICKED. \nLUCY Don't yell at me. My mom and dad used to yell at me. \n", "test3_true": "INT. EMILY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nRushes in. Slams the door. Bolts the deadbolts. CLUNK. CLUNK. CLUNK. Moment of panic. Will they hold? \nSlides her bureau in front of the door. Shoves her bed in front of the bureau just to be sure. \nIn the silence we hear LUCY'S FOOTSTEPS coming down the hall toward the door. \nCloser, closer... \nThere's nothing else to block the door with. Emily backs away, trembling as \nLUCY'S FOOTSTEPS arrive at the door. A tense silence. Then: \nLUCY (O.S.) Emily... I'm sorry... I didn't mean to... \nEmily grabs the screwdriver, clutches it in both hands. \nLUCY (O.S.) Can I come in so we can talk and work it out? \nThere's a GENTLE KNOCK on the door. Emily flinches, remembering last time. \nLUCY (O.S.) Emily...? \nEMILY Stay away from me! \nLUCY (O.S.) Don't be mad. I said I was sorry. I'll brush your hair for you. \nEMILY STAY AWAY FROM ME!! \nSilence. \nTHEN: \nWHAM! The door shudders from a MAMMOTH IMPACT. Last time, it shook the door, this time it shakes the entire wall. Emily recoils, dropping the screwdriver. \nWHAM! CRACKS APPEAR in the door as it bows from the tremendous force. \nWHAM!! CRACKS FAN OUT into the plaster around the doorframe. \nWHAM!! Half the SCREWS HOLDING THE HINGES fly from the wall. \nWHAM!! The DEADBOLTS BENDING from the ungodly pummeling. \nWHAM!! The DEADBOLT SCREWS getting yanked from the wood. \nEmily frozen in terror, watching. Whatever's out there is coming in. \nWHAM!! One of the DOOR HINGES rips clean from the wall. \nWHAM!! The FIRST DEADBOLT comes flying off. \nWHAM!! The SECOND DOOR HINGE gone. \nWHAM!! ANOTHER DEADBOLT flies off. \nWHAM!! The DOOR SPLITS down the center. \nWHAM!! The THIRD DEADBOLT lands on the floor at Emily's feet with a METAL THUD. \nA breathless silence. \nThen the DOOR RATTLES and drops loose from the frame with a DEAD WOODEN CLUNK. \nNothing holding it in place now except the bureau and the bed. And now they both start to SLIDE BACKWARDS as whatever is on the other side starts pushing its way in. \nEmily topples a high bookcase against the door and pushes back with every ounce of strength she can muster, but it's no use. The bureau overturns, CRASHES to the floor. Emily's bare feet slide backwards along with the bed. \nAnd then they stop. The barricade sufficiently breached. \nEmily, in her panic, makes a hasty decision. She hides under the bed. \nWe HOLD LOW on the open door as LUCY'S FEET step into the room, the feet of a child, but the BREATHING we hear sounds emphysemic and the VOICE is unquestionably male - harsh, guttural, taunting Emily as it comes for her: \nSINISTER MALE VOICE Emily... \nWide-eyed with terror under the bed, she watches those feet pick their way over the shattered remnants of the barricade. \nSINISTER MALE VOICE Emily... We need to learn healthier ways of resolving conflict, Emily. \nThe feet step gingerly past the overturned bureau. \nSINISTER MALE VOICE ...Most families don't even know they have a problem... \nThe feet stop at the SCREWDRIVER. \n", "test3_id": 1181}

Somebody help Holly. \nOther VOICES mumble agreement. Holly moves off into the dark room, hands reaching out to help her. \nVOICE You two. Just go straight ahead. Follow the corridors with the pipes overhead to the end. Then use the key. \nAs the voice speaks the spotlight finally goes off and by a dim glow around the perimeter, we see we're in some kind of large underground chamber--some part of the vast undercellars of the city. The light is enough to reveal that there are perhaps twenty people in the room, reds and greens both--but all are silhouetted, no face seen. There's a kind of aisle open down the room's center and it's obviously the way they are to go. Logan and Jessica move off. Logan pauses. \nLOGAN I don't know who you are. I'd like to thank someone. \nVOICE It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end. \nLOGAN I Will there be someone to tell us where to go from there...? \nA murmur of discussion then: \nVOICE Someone will follow. When you come to the lock, he will tell you how Co go on the other side. Jessica may go with you as far as the lock. \nLOGAN (a deep breath) No. Jessica goes back now. Take her back. (suddenly his tone is urgent as he speaks to her) Now! Go on back. Back outside, Jessica. \nShe is bewildered by the change. \nJESSICA Why?- No...no...I'm going with you. \nVOICE1 Only to the lock. After that there's no way back. \nJESSICA (small voice) I don't care. I'm going to Sanctuary. With you. \nA BABBLE of VOICES. \"Impossible\"...She ignores, watches Logan. JESSICA (cont'd) Will you take me with you? \nLOGAN Why, Jessica? You're still a green. JESSICA shakes her head. She doesn't know why. \nLogan puts his arm around her, marveling, trying to understand, moved. But suddenly he remembers the urgency of the moment. He wheels, pulling her with him. LOGAN Come on then--they'll be here any minute! \nUncomprehending, she starts to run with him. Too late. An EXPLOSION shakes the chamber--the wall bellies inward and a group of Sandmen, led by Francis, burst into the room, firing as they come. Panic. Turmoil. PEOPLE running, SCREAMING--the ALARM BELL RINGING, RINGING as Sandmen methodically slaughter the people in the wreckage of the room. \n209 \t\tOUT \n209X1\tLOGAN AND JESSICA \nAs the brief, one-sided battle rages, echoing SHOTS and SCREAMS in the dust filled room, Logan pulls her down out of the way. They watch, helplessly. Suddenly the figure of a Sandman looms before them. He stares at Logan, unsure. Logan reacts, draws, fires. The Sandman is smashed away, burning. \n209X2\tLOGAN \nSuddenly aware that he has killed a Sandman. Jessica pulls him down again into the shadow. Neither realizes chat the soft pulsing of his crystal can be seen from the room. \n210\t\tANOTHER ANGLE \nFrancis, quartering the room like a hound, searching, searching, stopping as he sees \n211\t\tFRANCIS P.O.V. The crystal blinking red, eerie in the darkness. \nFRANCIS (believing the blinking crystal is Jessica's) Logan. I know you're in here. What've you done...gone crazy over a Runner? (whispering) Nobody knows except me. You know I won't say anything. I should have turned you in but I couldn't. Leave her. Come on out with me. It'll look like you're part of the group that hit this nest. (pleading) Logan...you're a Sandman! (slightest beat) Logan...now...now...Logan... \nAfter the slightest beat, Logan FIRES and Francis falls, a great chunk of the cave roof falling between him and Logan -- all vision obscured while EXPLOSIONS and SCREAMS continue. \n212\t\tLOGAN AND JESSICA \nAs he pulls her shakily to her feet. She nods, she's okay. He leads her off down the tunnel. \n213\t\tWITH LOGAN AND JESSICA - TUNNEL \nfollowing the tracks. The way leads down, curves, recurves, but always down. \n214\t\tANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING LOCK As Logan and Jessica rush toward it. The corridor has widened into a kind of chamber which ends in a great metal door like an immense submarine hatch. \nThe tracks run straight to it and beneath it. The base of the door tands in a couple of inches of water. With great urgency, Logan and Jessica examine the huge door. Logan gives the wheel a tug...nothing. \nSOUND: A WHIRRING like clockwork...A METALLIC BELL SOUND and then a RECORDED VOICE. \nVOICE Runner, this is the last gate. Use your key now. When the Bell sounds again...use your key. Good luck, Runner. May you find Sanctuary. \nSILENCE. Then the BELL CHIME SOUND and a light illumines the center of the wheel where there's a kind of keyhole. The WHIRRING continues for about ten seconds. Then it stops\tand the light goes out. \n214X1\tLOGAN AND JESSICA \nHearing a SOUND they turn and see: 214X2\tANOTHER ANGLE - P.O.V. \nFar behind them, in the wet glisten of the tunnel, a bobbing light and shadow -- the SOUND of RUNNING \n", "test1_true": "As Jessica takes the ankh from her neck - fumbling with the chain. \nJESSICA (breathlessly) Every key only works once...and only a Lastday key must open this door.... They said it would fit - but.... \nShe tries to fit the ankh into the glowing one, but her hand shakes. Logan tries to steady her - and in helping, she drops it into the dark pool of water. They fall to their knees, searching desperately. Then Logan remembers. \nLOGAN Wait - I have the one I took from the Runner. \nSOUND: The same as before as Logan searches his pockets for the Runner's ankh. \nLogan finds it just as the WHIRRING SOUND has STOPPED again...and the light has gone out again in the center of the wheel. \nAs Logan and Jessica wait for the sound, etcetera to repeat again another TREMENDOUS EXPLOSION is heard rocking everything.  In the distance, Jessica can see the shadow of a FIGURE approaching. \nAs the SOUND, etcetera, repeat-s once more...Logan pushes the ankh into the lighted center of the wheel. The ankh fuses and the lighted center becomes brighter as the door opens. \nThere is a hesitation...in which Logan turning his head back... realizes what he has done and is shaken. \nAs the shadowed FIGURE looms LARGER: \nJESSICA There's no turning back, is there? \nLogan turns and pushes Jessica through the door... following her... as the door closes and they are: \n217\t\tON THE OTHER SIDE \nnow, they can still hear the SOUND, etcetera for the last time. \nBeyond the lock is the ruins of a vast undersea complex in which food was raised and harvested. What we see is an endless shadowy labyrinth of breeding pens which stretch off into the green darkness -- a kind of mammoth aquarium with catwalks and ramps intersecting the huge tanks. The levels are multiple and everything is slimed, rusted, rotted and wet. \nIn the tanks themselves are shoals of fish, gardens of seaweed, etc. The machinery for harvesting and winnowing has long since gone to rust -- and visible in the great tanks are the wrecks of vessels and gear -- the kind of stuff Cousteau and Co. are using now. \nFooting is dangerous -- a slip from any catwalk means a plunge into water and some of the walkways are well under water anyhow. From an invisible ceiling comes a steady dripping and everything is crusted and smells of salt and decay and life in the darkness. \n217X1\tWITH FRANCIS \nAs he arrives at the door, the ankh glowing as before. \nBut Francis has a light. He examines the door with it, and as it lights the pool of water on the ground, it picks out Jessica's ankh. FRANCIS stoops, gets it and looks from it to the one glowing 128\t\tLOGAN AND JESSICA \nBewildered -- uncertain, as their eyes adjust to the dim light. Finally, Logan gestures ''this way\" and sets out. \n(NOTE: The action of the sequence is the action of people groping through a labyrinth. They go along, gripping a rail where possible, sometimes sinking deep into water, sometimes rising above it. They run into blind endings and retrace to the last junction -- always trying for what looks driest and seems to stretch farthest along the great wall...) \n219-224\tWITH LOGAN AND JESSICA - SERIES OF CUTS \nA. Making their way along the walkway side by side. \nB. Stopping as the walkway disappears under water. Logan wading in while she waits -- until he re-emerges. She follows. \nC. Choosing between diverging ramps. Having to return. \nJESSICA How do we know this is the right way? \nLOGAN It's the only way. D. POV an alley way full of machinery. Logan gives a wheel a half turn -- great rusty net-combs start to winnow the water. \nE. Helping Jessica, Logan slips...falls into darkness. Jessica's fear until he emerges, hand over slimy hand. The water is cold. \nF. POV ancient signs - PROTOPLANK...DEPOT NO #11 DO NOT DECANT... HABITAT MARITIME...ETC. \nThey speculate. \nJESSICA What do you suppose this was...? \nLOGAN Some kind of breeding pens...I suppose...They say people used to breed animal s, fish, anything (at her disbelieving look) To eat, of course. JESSICA Ycch. (shudders) To kill things and then eat them. It must have been a savage world. Logan shrugs, but the idea makes him queasy, too. G. They stop, tired. Peer through at the wreckage of a small inspection vessel and suddenly hear: \nSOUND: FOOTSTEPS, coming, halting, WATER sloshing. Steps again. \n225\t\tPOV - THROUGH THE MAZE OF TANKS - A LIGHT \nmoving, hunting. \nLOGAN (alert) Stay here, while I see what it is. \nJessica nods, frightened. Logan slips off into the darkness. In a moment he's back. His face - is grim. \nJESSICA It's Francis, isn't it? \nHe nods. \n226\t\tLOGAN AND JESSICA \nTrying to move faster now, Logan makes a wrong turning and they must go back. But as they do so, Francis is ever closer -- a gigantic distorted SHAPE now visible through the eerie glass -then suddenly seeming small and distant. \n", "test1_id": 1908, "test2_input": "By this time, Logan and Jessica are no longer listening to Box...their arms are enveloping one another...with strong feelings. \nBOX'S VOICE Superb! \n242\t\tANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING BOX \nAs his metal hand begins to BUZZ...he brings it to the base of the huge column supporting the cavern. \nAs he works furiously...at Incredible speed: \n243\t\tLOGAN AND JESSICA \n...oblivious to Box...their feelings intensifying as they continue to hold one another. \n244-245\tOUT \n246\t\tCLOSE - ON BOX \nBOX (stepping back) Done...behold...! \n247\t\tREVERSE ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA \nBefore they turn to view the sculpture they kiss long and passionately. \nTheir mood is broken by: \nBOX'S VOICE Done...Done...Done... \nLogan and Jessica break.

{"train": "Logan's Run by David Zelag Goodman (April 30, 1975 revised draft) \nLOGANS RUN \nScreenplay By David Zelag Goodman \nProducer: Saul David \nDirector: Michael Anderson \nProduction Design: Dale Hennesy \nRevised : April 30, 1975 \nPLEASE NOTE THE CRYSTAL WILL BE USED IN THE LEFT HAND OF ALL CHARACTERS. \nFADE IN: BEFORE AND DURING  TITLES \n1\t\tEXT. - SKY NIGHT \nThe moon and stars are visible, but as CAMERA looks down, the SCREEN fills with dark, billowing clouds. CAMERA moves into the clouds and just  as they blank out the SCREEN, a distant shimmer of light becomes visible.  Moving toward it, the shimmer becomes \n2\t\tEXT. - DOME OF GLASS - NIGHT \nA glowing but not transparent structure stretching off into the clouds  that press it. CAMERA continues to move in until the detailed structural  webbing of the dome fills the SCREEN and then CAMERA MOVES THROUGH IT and  we see \n3\t\tEXT. - THE CITY - DAY \nShining below the dome (which we now see as a series of dome-like structures standing off without end) -a marvelous crystalline city of  great openness, building clusters, green plazas, fountains... multi-leveled  but human scale, crisscrossed by the flickering clear tubes of the MAZE- CARS. \n4\t\tCLOSER ANGLE - ROOFTOPS \nAs a MAZE-CAR slides softly to a stop. \n5\t\tROOFTOP - THE RUNNER \nThe hatch opens and a MAN in a hurry leaves the maze-car and runs swiftly  along the rooftop and disappears into an open elevator which instantly  starts to descend. \n6\t\tINT - RESIDENCE PLAZA - THE ELEVATOR \nFrom a busy courtyard below we watch the elevator slide down from a great  height.  As it reaches the courtyard the RUNNER darts out, pushes into  the crowd. \n7 \t\tOUT \n8\t\tWITH THE RUNNER \nAs he reappears around a corner, skirts a brimming pool and makes for a  kind of broad corridor which seems to lead out of the courtyard. He is  moving even faster now, glancing back as if he fears pursuit. \n9\t\tANOTHER ANGLE - CORRIDOR \nAbove, at the railing of an oval light well, dressed in black and silver,   a figure holding an odd looking weapon lazily in one hand -- and watching.  It is FRANCIS. \n10\t\tWITH THE RUNNER \nMoving rapidly down the corridor, he suddenly stops as if feeling the  presence above. He looks up, sees the SANDMAN and his face breaks in  terror. He wheels, frantic, screaming, runs back into the hall. \n11\t\tTHE SANDMAN (FRANCIS) \nVaulting the rail, dropping lightly to ground level, weapon poised. \n12\t\tP.O.V. \nThe crowd melting, parting to reveal the Runner backed against the pool.  People are YELLING, shaking their fists, terribly excited and fearful. \n13\t\tTHE SANDMAN \nEmotionless. Aims. Fires. \n14\t\tTHE RUNNER - CLOSE \nSeeming to burst aflame in the LENS, then slipping BELOW FRAME to reveal  Francis sauntering forward, holstering his weapon. The crowd closing in  behind him, applauding, congratulating him. \n15\t\tTHE SANDMAN \nArriving at the pool where the body lies, half immersed. He leans over,  lifts the right hand from the water, revealing a palm with a black  flowercrystal shape in it. He lets the hand fall back now as the crowd   CHEERS and APPLAUDS him. \n16\t\tEXTREME CLOSE UP - HAND - IN THE WATER - (INSERT) \nClosing in until the crystal fills the SCREEN. \nMATCH DISSOLVE TO: \n(TITLES END) \n17\t\tCLOSE UP - CRYSTAL - (INSERT) \n21\t\tINT. - MAZE-CAR - LOGAN AND FRANCIS \nThe door slides shut. They sink into seat forms which yield to them. They   move off. \n22\t\tEXT. - MAZE- CAR \nMoving through the city at terrific speed. Giving us glimpses of the city  as it goes. slowing finally as we see: \n23\t\tTHE CITY - FEATURING ARCADE \nBrightly lit, garish. We get only a glimpse as the maze-car disappears  into a tunnel. \n24\t\tMAZE-CAR STATION - ARCADE \nAs the maze-car stops, opens and Logan and Francis exit into   a gathering  CROWD. \n25\t\tFULL SHOT - ARCADE \nGlittering, crowded. Throngs of people moving on many levels, some walking, some on moving platforms. It's The Great White Way, Luna Park --  you name it. Gaudy booths and entrances, featuring every delight -- too  much to take in at a glance. \n26\t\tWITH LOGAN AND FRANCIS \nAs they thread their way through a crowd which admires them when it notices them, across halls and up moving platforms, the good-natured argument continuing... \nLOGAN but you don't know, you Just say what everyone says.  One for one. One for one.\" \nFRANCIS Well, why no!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -You have a better idea? \nLOGAN (laughs) No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that \"one for one\" song of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher With a stuck tape. \nFRANCIS Well the minute you get a better idea you can stop wondering. (beat) You know, Logan -- you wonder a lot. Too much for a Sandman \nThey are passing the facade of a Relive Shop The signs urging people to:  RELIVE YOUR MOST PRECIOUS MEMORIES. DO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN! REFRESH AND  RENEW ANYTIME!! \nAs they cross the entrance, two men come out, grinning broadly, falling  into step just ahead of Logan and Francis. Then one of the men stops  abruptly, almost colliding with them. He mumbles an apology and starts  back to RELIVE. \nAs he disappears into the RELIVE SHOP, his friend shrugs cheerfully to  Logan and Francis and moves on. \n27\t\tARCADE - ANOTHER ANGLE - NEW YOU \nThey are moving past a shop called NEW YOU #483 when a man comes cannonading out, thrilled and excited. He rushes over to a pretty young  woman who has been eying Logan and Francis, plants himself in front of  her with his hands framing his face. \nMAN Well? How do you like it? \nWOMAN (critically) I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little - \nMAN Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think? \nWOMAN Too little. \nMAN Too little? (gestures) Too little. Okay, wait for me. \nAnd he darts back into NEW YOU #483. The woman shrugs, glances around,  smiles and goes off with a passer-by. \n28\t\tARCADE - ANOTHER ANGLE - LOVE SHOP \nSigns promising LOVE, FULFILLMENT, RARE DELIGHTS. People streaming in and  out. A woman comes out looking glazed, breathing \"yes...yes...\" As she  passes CAMERA Logan and Francis emerge from the crowd and CAMERA moves  with them. \nLOGAN Did you ever see Francis-8? \nFRANCIS (shaking his head) I never even visited Nursery before tonight. (beat) When you wonder, it slows you up -- you know? \nThey are now passing the facade of HALLUCIMILL where the signs promise:  LIFT OFF, CRAZY LIFT, SUPER LIFT...here the people going in are simply  excited but the ones coming out are clearly stoned out of their minds... \nFRANCIS I don't know what makes you so curious. You have any idea who his seed-mother was? \nLOGAN (quickly) Of course not! I m curious, not sick. (laughs) \nThe crowd is growing denser, funneling into a kind of passageway. Logan  and Francis are swallowed up in the group. \n29\t\tFULL SHOT - ARCADE GREAT HALL \nAn immense room into which the streams of people coming from the entertainment area are mingling. There is a general air of anticipation  stirring the crowd as CAMERA singles out Logan and Francis entering,  waving to friends. CAMERA closes in on them just as they reach a  beautiful woman who is obviously pleased to see Francis. They embrace,  and as they break: \nFRANCIS and that's my friend, Logan. (as she acknowledges the introduction) We're celebrating his next in line. Carousel - Arcade - who knows? Want to come along? \nWOMAN (smiles, shakes her head) Only if I make it to the top of Carousel. (she holds up her hand) Thirty -- and the big spin. \nIn her palm the crystal blinks, red, black. Francis nods, gives her a  half-squeeze. \nFRANCIS You're thirty -- already? I always thought I was older than you - (beat) Well, give it a good try. \nWOMAN (pleasantly) You know I always have. \nAnother beautiful WOMAN joins them. \nTense, beginning nervous APPLAUSE here and there. \n42\t\tCAROUSEL \nAs the last one enters, beginning to glow and, as it does, the bowl slowly puts out leaves like some great plant, enfolding and hiding the people within a series of translucent petals. As the Last one enfolds them the Light intensifies, the exterior surfaces seeming to shift as if a kind of motion was beginning inside it... \n43\t\tCROWD \nVisible in the growing Light from Carousel -gripped with passion and excitement, APPLAUDING, gesturing as they see \n44\t\tCAROUSEL \nMoving, bands of light seeming to spiral upward Like a contained aurora as the Carousel picks up speed. \n45\t\tLOGAN \nCaught up in it Like the rest. \n46\t\tCAROUSEL \nBeginning to blur with its own speed. Through the shifting, spiraling curtain of light we see bodies moving in a kind of weightlessness, always struggling to move higher. \nFollow a shadowy form as it moves, twists through other writhing shadows -- upward, upward. Suddenly the form is spread-eagled, and in a moment it is sharply outlined against the swirling canopy and then -- a searing flash. And it is gone. SOUND: Crowd in a frenzy -- SCREAMING. \n47\t\tFULL ANGLE - THE BLEACHER CROWD - FAVORING LOGAN \nStanding. SCREAMING their cheers as: \n48\t\tFULL SHOT - UP AT CAROUSEL \nHigh, reaching downward out of the shadows beneath the dome, fringing, intersecting rainbow bands appear, looping the swirling upper Carousel like Saturn's rings. Now we see figures reaching outward toward them...reaching and missing and falling -downward against the curtain and the flash of extinction. \n49\t\tMEDIUM ANGLE - A MAN \nAt the highest level...straining for the rainbow... \n50\t\tSWEEPING PAN SHOT - THE BLEACHER CROWD \nHysterical...starting to chant... \nCROWD Renew! \nThe man continues to strain: \nCROWD Renew! \n51\t\tCLOSE ANGLE - THE MAN \nAlmost a blur...but still straining: CROWD'S CHANT Renew! \n52\t\tCLOSE ON - LOGAN AND FRANCIS \nLOGAN AND FRANCIS (chanting with the rest) Renew! \n53\t\tCLOSE ANGLE - THE MAN \nThe blur...but still there...straining with all his might for the rainbow... \nCROWD'S CHANT Re... \nSuddenly, the man...topples into the whirling blackness below...where he is instantly incinerated. \n54\t\tWIDE ANGLE - THE CAROUSEL \nWhirling - whirling - the rainbows shining. \n55\t\tWIDE ANGLE - THE BLEACHERS \nOrgiastic pleasure -- a Spanish crowd at a perfect killing -- SCREAMING, fulfilled. \n56 \t\tOUT \n57\t\tFULL ANGLE - THE CAROUSEL Other figures move to the topmost level...straining for the rainbow bands. \n58\t\tCLOSE ON - LOGAN AND FRANCIS \nAs the SCREAMING goes on in the b.g. of the SHUT... we hear a BUZZING noise. Logan reaches into a pocket and takes out a small, dark plastic box. \nLogan looks at the box. On it we see: \nMAN: RELIVE STORE 14 LOGAN (to Francis) Looks like I'm working. Francis stands. LOGAN Who invited you? \nFRANCIS I'm in my party mood. Logan smiles . . . and the CAMERA PANS them rushing out of the bleachers. \nThey make their way into the hall. \n65-68\tOUT \n69\t\tINT. - SANDMAN H.Q. - DEBRIEFING AREA \nBlack door opens revealing Logan and Francis who now enter a mammoth room. As they walk. . . they pass FOUR GIANT LIFECLOCKS...WHITE, YELLOW GREEN AND RED. Each LIFECLOCK pulses out the moments of every person alive in the city, governing everyone's crystal changes automatically shifting to the next LIFECLOCK when the time comes. \nThere are no humans. \nFrancis walks over to a circular table at the end of the room.... above which is a circular overhang. There is a groove...the shape of a palm crystal on one part of the circular table. \nFrancis takes out the plastic bag which contains the contents of the dead Runner's pockets and starts putting the contents on the table. (These contents are the ones from the Runner Francis has killed at the beginning of the film.) \nThe moment the first item touches the table...it activates a scanner on the overhang above. Francis stands alongside the table...his attitude is very matter-of fact. He has been through this procedure many, many times. He touches his head...(the hangover)...and Logan smiles. Moments later...the scanner stops...the word: IDENTIFY \nappears on a SCREEN. Francis places his palm into the groove. . . and the words: CLEAR FRANCIS-7 \nappear on the SCREEN. \nFRANCIS See you in the hydrotoner! Logan nods. \nFrancis exits as Logan places the contents of a plastic bag with the items he has taken off the Runner who jumped to his death. Among them is the odd-shaped piece of jewelry. \nLogan is standing nonchalantly...as the scanner moves over the items...waiting to be quickly identified and cleared as Francis was earlier. \nThe scanner continues scanning. \nLogan starts becoming impatient...but the scanning goes on and on and on. \nNow...Logan is clearly puzzled...it has never...ever taken anything remotely resembling this length of time. \nSuddenly, directly before him...on the SCREEN... the word: \nPROBABILITY \nblinks on and off...on and off...catching Logan's attention. As Logan turns toward the SCREEN...the scanner stops moving. The word PROBABILITY blinks off and is replaced by the word: APPROACH \nWe can tell from Logan's expression as he walks to the corner. . . that he has never seen this before. Logan sits in a chair in the area facing the SCREEN. There is a stellar groove (that we have seen on the Table) the shape of a palm crystal....glowing on an arm of the chair. \nThe word on the SCREEN is now: \nIDENTIFY \nLogan places his right palm with the flower crystal into the groove. We hear a HUMMING NOISE....then: The piece of jade Jewelry appears on the SCREEN and below the piece of jewelry the following words appear on the SCREEN: \nOBJECT OCCURS IN NONRANDOM PATTERN AND FREQUENCY. LINKED WITH OBSOLETE WORD: SANCTUARY. PROBABLE EXISTENCE ESTABLISHED. QUESTION: IDENTIFY OBJECT? \nLOGAN Negative. Question: What is it? Words on SCREEN now read: \nPREMILLENNIAL SYMBOL. NAME: ANKH. QUESTION: IDENTIFY CONCEPT SANCTUARY? \nLOGAN Negative. \nWords on SCREEN now read: \nSANCTUARY: CODE WORD PREMILL- ENNIAL RELIGIONS DENOTING PLACE OF IMMUNITY. \nLOGAN I don't understand? \nWords on SCREEN now read: \nSANCTUARY NOW MATHEMATICALLY RELATED TO UNACCOUNTED CITIZENS NUMBERING 1056. LOGAN Question: \nWord on SCREEN now reads: \nHOLD It disappears and words on SCREEN now read: \nOBJECT ANKH ASSOCIATED WITH UNACCOUNTED CITIZENS 1056. CONCLUSION SANCTUARY EXISTENT.... RUNNER GOAL. \nLOGAN 1056 unaccounted for?! \nWord on SCREEN reads: \nCORRECT \nLOGAN Impossible! (Rising tone) Question: Maybe they weren't all Runners. Maybe most of them reached Life Renewal on Carousel. \nWords on SCREEN read: \nNEGATIVE...UNACCOUNTED CITIZENS 1056... \nLOGAN Question: None of them reached renewal? \nWord on SCREEN reads: \nZERO \nLogan nods, exits. The CAMERA REMAINS on a slightly puzzled FRANCIS for a moment then FOLLOW Logan out to: \n70\t\tEXT. - SANDMAN BUILDING \nLogan is on the steps, irresolute. He looks at his blinking crystal...moves as if to reenter, changes his mind. Now takes out the black box, dials. \nLOGAN (into box) Location...female Green Six... name Jessica...living in Quad K. \n71-73 \tOUT \n73X1\t\tINT. - LOGAN'S APARTMENT \nLogan opens the door to see Jessica. Behind her a young SANDMAN who has obviously escorted her there. \nYOUNG SANDMAN (smiling) She says she's been here before... \nLOGAN She has. \nJessica half turns and shrugs a 'see?'. The young Sandman's smile widens, he waves to Logan and shoves off. \nJESSICA You could have called me yourself. \nLOGAN But I wasn't sure you'd come. \nJESSICA (the game has started) Here I am. (beat) Shall I come in? \nLogan gestures, leading her inside to the living area. \nLOGAN I couldn't get you out of my mind. \nJESSICA I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose? \nLOGAN Maybe...sure.... \nJESSICA Thanks...but I have the choice. LOGAN Of course. JESSICA Then it's still no. \nLogan laughs. \nJESSICA You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want? \nLOGAN You know \nJESSICA I don't believe you. There has to be more. \nLOGAN All right. \nLogan extends his right hand. He turns his right palm so that. Jessica can see it blinking red. \nJessica gasps for a moment...then: \nJESSICA Why show me? \nLOGAN I'm going to run. \nJESSICA (after reacting) Why tell me? \nLOGAN You know something. JESSICA About running, dying what? \nLOGAN Both...running's what I'm interested in. \nJESSICA I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has. \nLOGAN It's different now. Help me. \nJESSICA How can I? \nLogan takes out the ankh. \nJESSICA Where did you get that? \nLOGAN A Runner gave it to me. \nJESSICA And then you killed him, right? \nLOGAN I let him go...believe me. \nJESSICA I don't.. \nLOGAN (a beat) Speak to your friends for me, Jessica... please... \nJESSICA Please? What friends? \nLOGAN (clutching the ankh, looking at Jessica's; then:) I don't have much time. \nJESSICA I never heard of a Sandman running . . . ever. . . \nMaking her way through the strolling crowd, her face thoughtful. \n94X2\t\tANOTHER ANGLE \nThe man from the restaurant, following. \n94X3\t\tGALLERY, SANDMAN RESIDENCE -- JESSICA \nWalking slowly up to a door, she hesitates, KNOCKS. \nLogan opens the door, reacts. \nLOGAN Are you here to help me? JESSICA What do you need? \nA moment, then Logan moves toward her hungrily, pulling her in to him as the door closes. \n94X4 \tOUT \nDISSOLVE TO: 94X5\t\tWITH LOGAN AND JESSICA \nWalking along a handsomely landscaped stream. Laughing together, stopping to admire the beautiful fish (koi). \nJESSICA What're you going to do? \nLOGAN That's tomorrow. \nJESSICA (turning away slightly) I wish I could help you. \nLOGAN (turning her gently back) Maybe you'll chink of something... \nJESSICA (hating herself) I wish I knew what you think I know. \nLogan smiles at her, both knowing what's false, but drawn to each other anyhow. They commence walking again. 94X6\t\tANOTHER ANGLE \nThe followers, ahead now, watching, trying to make up their minds as to whether Jessica is bringing Logan to the ambush. As they argue, Logan and Jessica approach. \n94X7\t\tWITH LOGAN AND JESSICA \nLOGAN If you did know, you'd tell me. JESSICA Of course-- \nLOGAN (overriding) If you trusted me, you'd know. JESSICA (evading it) We're coming to Arcade. (beat)\t- Shall we Relive together? 94X8\t\tCLOSE ANGLE \nAs they pass, Jessica looks full in the face of one of the followers, looks away. Logan does not notice. The followers are partly reassured. One of the men is now holding a garrote made from his necklace. The man who first followed gestures and the others go off purposefully. He continues after Logan and Jessica as they exit round a corner. \n94X9 \tOUT \n94AX9\tREADY ROOM \nAs 1st Sandman returns, still cheerfully chewing. Francis is reluctant to give up his place and when he does, he remains standing there, watching. He loves the work--they all do. \n94X10\tARCADE - LOWER LEVEL \nLogan and Jessica entering. Logan is aware of Jessica's increasing tension. He pretends unconcern, but he is wary. \n94X11\tANOTHER ANGLE \nBehind them, visible through the crowd--two of the men we saw before. The Follower and the man with the garrote. They are moving so as to intersect with Logan and Jessica where the crowd is thickest, streams coming together to move to a higher level. \n94X12\tFEATURING JESSICA \nAs they move, fearful--torn between her promise and her feeling for Logan. Catching a glimpse of the followers, she makes a small sound, hesitates, pretends to have stumbled. \n94X13\tTHE AMBUSHERS \nCloser now, closing in -- the wire garrote gleaming between the man's hands. 94X14\tLOGAN AND JESSICA \nSuddenly she stops. He comes round facing as people eddy by them. Logan looks at her searchingly. \nLOGAN Tell me, Jessica. \nBehind him the two men move in. The man with the garrote raises his hands. One more step... Logan senses something, half-turns just as we hear a familiar urgent SOUND--the sound of his transceiver. Behind him the man hesitates, drops his hands. Logan takes the transceiver from his belt and moves out of the crowd to the side, Jessica with him. Now he bends to read the message and Jessica cranes her head to see too. 94X15\tREADY ROOM - FRANCIS AND SANDMEN \nAs the Runner alarm pulses and the readout flashes its message: \nRUNNER FEMALE: CATHEDRAL Q-2 ...LOGAN-5 \nThe Sandman at the console turns and says: \n1ST SANDMAN Hey, Logan's got a mean one tonight-- why don't you-- \nBut Francis is already at the door. A wave and he's gone. The others ad lib interest-- \"watch out in there--they can cut you before you see them\" etc. \n95-105 \tOUT \n105X1\tARCADE STATION - THE AMBUSH \nStunned and uncertain, Francis aims his gun toward Logan and Jessica...but he wavers...watching them disappear into the rubble... \n134\t\tANOTHER ANGLE - FRANCIS \nshivering like a wet dog. He turns toward open window. FRANCIS (in a firm, cold tone) Runner! The woman turns, staring insanely. Her mouth opens like a fish as: Francis FIRES his gun. A moment later, as the burning body topples to the floor; \n134X1\t\tMAZE-CAR PLATFORM - THE MEN \nhearing the unmistakable SCREAMING sound of the kill, they exchange a look. \n135\t\tLOGAN AND JESSICA \nAt the flash of FIRE from Francis' gun, they turn. Logan and Francis' eyes meet. A beat, then Logan grabs Jessica and pulls her away. \n136\t\tFRANCIS \nAfter a long, long hesitation, takes out his small plastic box and starts to speak into it: \nFRANCIS (quietly) Runner terminated at G.16 Ready for cleanup at Cathedral Quadrant 39. 137\t\tANOTHER ANGLE - OVERLOOKING CATHEDRAL ENTRANCE \nThe Second and Third Men...very close to the maze-car platform... peering into the darkness and seeing Logan and Jessica emerge onto the maze-car platform. We can tell from the way the two men look at one another that they believe Logan has fired the shot they have heard. \nThey hide from the approaching Logan and Jessica. \nSECOND MAN I almost believed her. \nThey move off soundlessly. Behind them, a maze-car has arrived. \n138\t\tMED. - ANGLE - FRANCIS \nGun in hand...running through Cathedral toward the maze-car platform. \n139\t\tINT. - MAZE-CAR - LOGAN AND JESSICA - MOVING SHOT \nJESSICA I'm ashamed. I was bringing you to be killed. \nLOGAN Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there? \nJESSICA Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you. \nLOGAN (a beat) All right. But why? I didn't kill the Runner. \nJESSICA (interrupting) Yes, but they won't know that...or care. They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, now... \nLOGAN (wry laugh) That's nothing...there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them. \nJESSICA (torn) I - I can't. \nLOGAN Then - why don't you leave me - go to them - explain \nJESSICA No. Not that either. \nLogan considers her. A long BEAT. Thinking, then: \nLOGAN All right. New You 483. I'll find out myself. \n139X1\t\tINT. - SANDMAN READY ROOM - FRANCIS \nDistracted...ignoring the greetings of Sandmen who are monitoring the city. \n139X2\t\tANOTHER ANGLE - FRANCIS \nWalking past the GIANT LIFECLOCKS into the debriefing area. \nThe scanners begin moving. \nMoments later the scanner stops...the word: \nIDENTIFY \nappears on a SCREEN Francis pauses a moment and places his palm into the groove. \nNow he takes out the items of the dead woman Runner and places them on the scanning table. \nAn ALARM SOUNDS and the word: \nREJECT \nflashes on and off on the SCREEN. \nSandmen come running into the Area. \nSANDMAN What happened?! \nFrancis hesitates....then....quickly, as if changing his mind, taking the items off the table: FRANCIS Can you beat it....I've got the damn wrong bag. \nDOC Holly works here because she gets a lift out of watching the Table... (smiles) and other things. I'll be back in a minute. \nHOLLY He's going to sterilize himself. \nLOGAN Do I have to undress? \nHOLLY Not for your face. \nLogan follows Holly to the Table. (Jessica remains behind with Doc who speaks to her with soft urgency). \nDOC You shouldn't have brought him here. \nJESSICA; I didn't bring him -- what's the difference. He's blinking. He wants to run. DOC Run!? He's a Sandman. \nJESSICA I tell you he's running. I know. DOC Maybe...Maybe. But I wish he'd gone somewhere else. (a beat, a shrug) All right. He gets a face. 144X1\t\tTHE SURGICAL TABLE - LOGAN AND HOLLY \nLogan lies down. \nThe Table ripples...accepting his weight prisoning and positioning him. \nHOLLY (leaning - close to Logan) I like dark hair. Have him give you dark hair. \nDOC'S VOICE All set? HOLLY Um huh. Would you take a picture of him, Doc? I'd like you to give his face to somebody else. \nDOC Why not? \nDoc pushes a button...there is a tiny FLASH. \nDOC Do you have anything special in mind? \nLOGAN I don't care...Just get it over with. \nDOC (smiling) Hurry...hurry...hurry. \nHOLLY (whispering) Dark hair. \nLOGAN Holly'd like dark hair. DOC Holly'd like a lot of things. (studying Logan's face) We can start by narrowing the cheekbones. Doc presses buttons on the control board. Jessica, who is standing next to Doc, is slightly startled as the Table begins to HUM...as a pair of laser beams separate themselves from the overhead cluster and extend toward Logan, forming inner cones as they approach. \nCryoJector needles start to close in on them, nearing their faces and shoulders slowly...the visible cold streaming off the points. \nA vibrobeam begins to KEEN. \nSOUND: An insistent chiming. \nDoc hears the sound and turns with the martyred air of a man who's been called to the phone too many times. He turns to a phone-like apparatus nearby, shifting the table into neutral as he turns. The table and the laser heads stop moving. DOC (as if speaking on a phone) Hello (listening) Yes (listening) Yes, they are. (listening; his expression changing) Done. \nDoc turns back to the console, pausing to stare intently at Logan, then up at the brightly smiling Holly. Something in his look registers, and Holly's smile fades. Now Doc engages the machine again... \nDOC Pay attention, Sandman. I'm proud of this machine. \nAs he speaks he presses and an arm sweeps downward and into position near Logan's face. It pauses as \nDOC With this one there's no waiting for scar burnishing. It's all in one...watch now... \nThe laser arm sweeps across Logan's forehead and cheeks, leaving a bright trail of blood as \nDOC But here's the improvement. Instant healing---before you feel a thing. Watch now... \nDoc pushes a special button and the arm sweeps back along the track, spraying healing fluid. Magically the blood vanishes and the skin is moist and whole. \n144X2\t\tTHE SURGICAL TABLE - LOGAN \nHis face tense--he knows something's wrong. Over him Holly's bright face with its rapt look. She's not sure, but she enjoys whatever's happening. \n144X3\t\tBACK TO DOC \nwho is playing the console as he speaks. \nDOC Perfect depth adjustment on this one, Sandman. The beam will cut through that uniform and just exactly through the skin beneath-- absolute precision. Watch now And the machine does its stuff, slashing through Logan's tunic--a seam of blood following the rip. \nDOC Of course, it doesn't mend uniforms, Sandman, but otherwise it does everything, doesn't it? Just imagine what would happen to you if the healing stopped functioning. And the arm moves back again, spraying the healing fluid into Logan's new wound. Again the blood disappears. Suddenly Doc's look is ferocious. He turns off the healing switch and punches buttons fiercely. The laser arms begin to move wildly and the SOUNDS become shrill. Holly looks alarmed. \nHOLLY No! You're scrambling the table. He'll be cut to pieces, Doc. DOC Damn right! It was a trap. They know! LOGAN No - I'm Running! \nMachine begins to WHINE LOUDLY. \nJessica tries to turn the machine off...Doc starts to wrestle with her as: \n145-145X4\t\tINTERCUT: CLOSE ANGLES - THE CLUSTER ABOVE LOGAN \nMoving. \nHOLLY \nWatching two stun beams lower. \nLogan and Jessica running through Arcade. 167X1\tLOGAN AND JESSICA \nSuddenly she pulls him in another direction. \nJESSICA Follow me, Logan. Stay close. \nAs they run into Hallucimill...Francis...never too far behind... spots them and follows. \n173 \t\tOUT \n174\t\tEXT. - HALLUCIMILL - TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA \nExiting from the other side...and running through the crowd toward and into a Love Shop...followed by Francis coming out of the Hallucimill, too... and running toward the Love Shop. \n175\t\tINT. - LOVE SHOP - LOGAN AND JESSICA As they enter the hot darkness. The Love Shop is throbbing with sexuality. In it, the darkness breaks at Irregular intervals -- when booths and cubicles flare into brilliance, each time revealing an orgiastic tableau. The Love Shop is multi-leveled and the random flashes may appear from any direction at any time, blinding and stunning the viewer. Logan and Jessica pause to get their bearings and as they do, a beautiful WANTON grabs Logan, pulling and laughing: \nWANTON I have an empty one, Sandman \nLogan tries to pull away, looks around for Jessica just in time to see a man almost carrying her off.  Then the light is gone again and Jessica with it. \n176\t\tLOGAN AND THE WANTON \nAs she tears at his clothing, wrapping herself around him, trying to pull him down. Then, as the light flares again she suddenly lets go and grabs another man...Logan is, freed, starts looking for Jessica. \n179\t\tSERIES OF SHOTS \nLogan hunting through the Love Shop, fighting them off. \nINTERCUT SHOTS of the suddenly-illuminated tableaus. Sex, manifold and multiform -- everybody doing it. \n180\t\tANOTHER ANGLE - FRANCIS \nEntering, starting to look around -- grabbed by one of the laughing Wantons. \n181-182\tLOGAN, JESSICA \nBrief glimpses of them looking for each other. \n183\t\tFRANCIS \nHunting both. \n184\t\tWITH LOGAN \nAs he suddenly collides with a woman -- shoves her away and sees it's Jessica. Now together they make for an archway where multiple mirrors enclose them. \nSuddenly they are in darkness. Then a heavy door slides open and Jessica leads Logan through the opening. Behind them the door slides shut again. 185\t\tFRANCIS \nDesperately trying to get rid of a woman, sees a flash of Logan and Jessica far across the room -sees them leave. Then he's pulled down again as the orgy continues. \n186X1 \tOUT \n186X2\tINT. - AN IMMENSE METAL STAIRWAY \nAfter a moment, Jessica takes Logan's hand and they start down in the darkness. The SOUNDS of Love Shop still heard from behind the wall. \nLOGAN Are you taking me to them? \nJESSICA Yes. (beat) I don't know what else to do -- with him following us. (she hesitates) Why do you keep running from your-- \nLOGAN Because he's my friend - (a beat) and I don't want to be killed by him - or anyone. \nJESSICA He's good, isn't he? \nLOGAN Will he find us and kill us? Yes...or one of the others. (a beat) You know there's only one place to go now... \nJESSICA (hopelessly) They won't believe us. \nLOGAN (beat) I'd rather take my chances with them...than with Francis. \nJESSICA They won\u00b9t listen. LOGAN (interrupting) You think Sandmen will? (before she can answer) There's no other way for me, \nJESSICA We'll convince them. \nThey pause. He puts his hand over hers. Jessica is silent. Then she turns his hand over. The crystal blinks red -- on, off. \nJESSICA Yes, Logan. (turning to him blindly) I'm glad they didn't change your face. Logan embraces her, but his look is strange and remote. They continue down into the darkness. Behind them the SOUNDS of Love Shop die away and only their footsteps are heard. \n187 \t\tOUT 187X1\tFRANCIS At the mirrored archway, looking around carefully, testing. He knows they went through somehow. Hands claw at him - he brushes them away as he searches. \n188-200 \tOUT \n200X1\tWITH LOGAN AND JESSICA \nThey have come to the foot of the stair. Here the flooring shines wetly in the darkness. \nThe spear points are withdrawn. Logan and Jessica relieved but shaken, wary. \nLOGAN May we move? \nA long beat. Then-- \nVOICE I saw we pass them through. Somebody help Holly. \nOther VOICES mumble agreement. Holly moves off into the dark room, hands reaching out to help her. \nVOICE You two. Just go straight ahead. Follow the corridors with the pipes overhead to the end. Then use the key. \nAs the voice speaks the spotlight finally goes off and by a dim glow around the perimeter, we see we're in some kind of large underground chamber--some part of the vast undercellars of the city. The light is enough to reveal that there are perhaps twenty people in the room, reds and greens both--but all are silhouetted, no face seen. There's a kind of aisle open down the room's center and it's obviously the way they are to go. Logan and Jessica move off. Logan pauses. \nLOGAN I don't know who you are. I'd like to thank someone. \nVOICE It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end. \nLOGAN I Will there be someone to tell us where to go from there...? \nA murmur of discussion then: \nVOICE Someone will follow. When you come to the lock, he will tell you how Co go on the other side. Jessica may go with you as far as the lock. \nLOGAN (a deep breath) No. Jessica goes back now. Take her back. (suddenly his tone is urgent as he speaks to her) Now! Go on back. Back outside, Jessica. \nShe is bewildered by the change. \nJESSICA Why?- No...no...I'm going with you. \nVOICE1 Only to the lock. After that there's no way back. \nJESSICA (small voice) I don't care. I'm going to Sanctuary. With you. \nA BABBLE of VOICES. \"Impossible\"...She ignores, watches Logan. JESSICA (cont'd) Will you take me with you? \nLOGAN Why, Jessica? You're still a green. JESSICA shakes her head. She doesn't know why. \nLogan puts his arm around her, marveling, trying to understand, moved. But suddenly he remembers the urgency of the moment. He wheels, pulling her with him. LOGAN Come on then--they'll be here any minute! \nUncomprehending, she starts to run with him. Too late. An EXPLOSION shakes the chamber--the wall bellies inward and a group of Sandmen, led by Francis, burst into the room, firing as they come. Panic. Turmoil. PEOPLE running, SCREAMING--the ALARM BELL RINGING, RINGING as Sandmen methodically slaughter the people in the wreckage of the room. \n209 \t\tOUT \n209X1\tLOGAN AND JESSICA \nAs the brief, one-sided battle rages, echoing SHOTS and SCREAMS in the dust filled room, Logan pulls her down out of the way. They watch, helplessly. Suddenly the figure of a Sandman looms before them. He stares at Logan, unsure. Logan reacts, draws, fires. The Sandman is smashed away, burning. \n209X2\tLOGAN \nSuddenly aware that he has killed a Sandman. Jessica pulls him down again into the shadow. Neither realizes chat the soft pulsing of his crystal can be seen from the room. \n210\t\tANOTHER ANGLE \nFrancis, quartering the room like a hound, searching, searching, stopping as he sees \n211\t\tFRANCIS P.O.V. The crystal blinking red, eerie in the darkness. \nFRANCIS (believing the blinking crystal is Jessica's) Logan. I know you're in here. What've you done...gone crazy over a Runner? (whispering) Nobody knows except me. You know I won't say anything. I should have turned you in but I couldn't. Leave her. Come on out with me. It'll look like you're part of the group that hit this nest. (pleading) Logan...you're a Sandman! (slightest beat) Logan...now...now...Logan... \nAfter the slightest beat, Logan FIRES and Francis falls, a great chunk of the cave roof falling between him and Logan -- all vision obscured while EXPLOSIONS and SCREAMS continue. \n212\t\tLOGAN AND JESSICA \nAs he pulls her shakily to her feet. She nods, she's okay. He leads her off down the tunnel. \n213\t\tWITH LOGAN AND JESSICA - TUNNEL \nfollowing the tracks. The way leads down, curves, recurves, but always down. \n214\t\tANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING LOCK As Logan and Jessica rush toward it. The corridor has widened into a kind of chamber which ends in a great metal door like an immense submarine hatch. \nThe tracks run straight to it and beneath it. The base of the door tands in a couple of inches of water. With great urgency, Logan and Jessica examine the huge door. Logan gives the wheel a tug...nothing. \nSOUND: A WHIRRING like clockwork...A METALLIC BELL SOUND and then a RECORDED VOICE. \nVOICE Runner, this is the last gate. Use your key now. When the Bell sounds again...use your key. Good luck, Runner. May you find Sanctuary. \nSILENCE. Then the BELL CHIME SOUND and a light illumines the center of the wheel where there's a kind of keyhole. The WHIRRING continues for about ten seconds. Then it stops\tand the light goes out. \n214X1\tLOGAN AND JESSICA \nHearing a SOUND they turn and see: 214X2\tANOTHER ANGLE - P.O.V. \nFar behind them, in the wet glisten of the tunnel, a bobbing light and shadow -- the SOUND of RUNNING \nAs they emerge from the blind alley once again close to the wall, suddenly: \n227\t\tFRANCIS \nlooming huge, gun drawn, apparently only a few feet away. \n228\t\tLOGAN AND JESSICA \nLogan desperately claws at machinery, succeeds in starting motion, somewhere what sounds like a GENERATOR begins laboring, ancient machinery GROANS. They turn and run as they HEAR: FRANCIS (distorted; echo; etcetera) LOGAN N N N. 229\t\tPOV - FRANCIS' LIGHT \nis splashing the walls ahead and in it they suddenly see: \nTHE DOOR -- a waterlock with a wheel. As the light passes, Logan heaves desperately on it. It starts to give as the light comes back and they are revealed. \n230\t\tCLOSE - ON FRANCIS \naiming at Logan...then slowly moving his hand until Jessica is in his sights. \n231\t\tLOGAN - JESSICA - FRANCIS \nFrancis FIRES -- tremendous SOUND, ECHOING and RESOUNDING. One of the great tanks buckles and a cascade of water erupts over everything. Through it, Logan manages to get the door open and pushes a half-drowning Jessica through. \n232\t\tINT. - THE SHAFT \nA sort of ancient freight elevator which commences to move groaning when the waterlock door closes. Logan slumps to the floor. \n233\t\tINT. - SHAFT - TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA \nMoving at an extremely high speed...We can see the outside - flickering - dark, light, - dark, light... and finally to a white color. They lie slumped, motionless. Finally it stops. The door opens into a kind of glistening darkness, suffused by a bluish glow. It is now very cold. \nIn the silence Logan stirs. Groping, he touches Jessica, who moves close to him. Logan puts his arm around her and they rise. Slowly, tentatively, he leads her out into the dark chamber where they stand for a moment trying to find themselves. What little light there is seems to come from the left. Arm around Jessica, Logan starts to move. \nJESSICA (whispering) I'm afraid. \nLOGAN It's brighter there...besides, we can't go back. \nHe starts to move again but Jessica hangs back. \nJESSICA Wait. \nHe halts. \nJESSICA (cont'd) I don't know what's going to happen to us Logan but -- (a beat) Are you glad you didn't kill him? \nLOGAN It doesn't make any difference anymore. \nJESSICA You're really one of us now, aren't you? \nLOGAN You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you? (Jessica nods) Why did you stay with me? \nJESSICA (feelingly) I wanted to... (Logan puts his arms around her) ...And you...what made you kill Sandmen? \nLOGAN I had to. I did kill...for the first time in my life I killed. \nJESSICA Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you. \nLOGAN I guess so...I know I felt something I never felt before...and I didn't like it...not a bit. (after another long beat) I'll tell you one thing...Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now. \nJESSICA For us. \nLogan mouths \"Us\"...a strange word...and why not... in the last minutes he has done strange things. \n234-236 \tOUT 236x1\tINT. - ICE CAVERN \nSuddenly they are blinded by a brilliant light coming from the side and revealing for the first time where they are. \n236x2\tANGLE \nBefore them a vase, dim, ice-shrouded storage area, row upon endless row of frozen lockers trailing away into darkness, their legends and contents unreadable in the thick covering of ice and frost. To the side, a bright light. 236x3\tLOGAN AND JESSICA \nWalk toward the light. \n236x4\tWITH LOGAN AND JESSICA \nWe see a huge, high-domed cavern ringed and ornamented with extraordinary ice sculptures-They are everywhere: Otters, fish, a tusked walrus---overhead a flight of birds. \n236x5\tANOTHER ANGLE \nAs they look in wonder: \nVOICE Overwhelming, isn't it? \nLogan and Jessica turn and see: \n237-238\tOUT \nCareening around wildly in the growing ruin, as the lights dim and flicker out. \n270X7\tANGLE \nThe ceiling full of birds loosening, crashing down upon Box. Again and again like great spears and wedges \n270X8\tBOX Buried in his work, still feebly moving, then still as the roaring ice crashes down, in the terrible darkness. 270X9\tLOGAN AND JESSICA \nCowering in the crashing maelstrom of ice blocks--saved only by Being in an angle of the cave. \n270X10\tFULL SHOT The SCREEN blotted out by the cave-in, going out of focus. Silence. Then: \nSOUND: Ice melting, water running. \n270X11\tLOGAN AND JESSICA \nStir in the dimness, amazed to be alive. \nSOUND: A heavy crash and splash as another huge ice block falls into the water. \nAs it falls, the cave is suddenly illuminated again. They look and see the light is coming from a great fissure in the wall--opened by the last ice fall. Water rains across the opening. \nLogan and Jessica make their way to it, step out. \n271-272\tOUT \n273\t\tEXT. - HIGH LEDGE \nWater is pouring down in a waterfall from the icemelt. \nThey are blinded by: \n274\t\tSUNSHINE: A HUGE RISING SUN \nAs Logan and Jessica shield their eyes...then realizing that the dazzling light will not go away: \nStanding together...in fear of the sunrise. \nJESSICA Is there something on fire!! \nLogan shakes his head...he doesn't know. \nAs Logan looks up at the sun. LOGAN It seems to be moving away. Come on... \n274X1\tANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA \nclambering cautiously down from the barren ledge. \n274X2\tLOWER - AN AREA OF BOULDERS \nSuddenly, a FAIRLY STRONG WIND starts blowing. \nJESSICA (frightened) What's that? \nLOGAN It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving. \nJESSICA (smiling) And yours. \nThey reach the level below and pause, look around. \nLOGAN Jessica -- we must be outside! \nShe looks at him, uncertainly, he puts an arm around her and they set out again. \n275-276\tOUT \n276X1\tINT. - CAVE - CLOSE ON FRANCIS \nPicking his way through the ruined cave, puzzled. \n277-287X1 OUT \n288\t\tEXT . - FOREST AREA \nAs Logan and Jessica reach it. \nThey are startled by the SOUND of BIRDS SINGING for a moment...then continue through some high grass and thorned bushes being scratched, etcetera. \nA swarm of insects attack...Logan and Jessica fight them off: \nJESSICA (starting to panic) I hate outside! I hate it! \nLOGAN (holding her; comforting tone) We'll be all right... (a beat) We will... \nThe sun is starting to go down...as they see a rabbit dart away in the grass...startling them for a moment. 288XA1\tFRANCIS Coming out through the fissure in the rock, squinting at the unexpected light from the sky, then setting out as Logan and Jessica did. 288XB1\tWITH LOGAN AND JESSICA - A BUSHY AREA \nJESSICA Logan!!!Look!! (Logan turns around) No...your palm...look!!! \nLogan looks at his palm...the blinking crystal is clear. \nHe grabs Jessica's hand and looks at her palm... the same. \nJESSICA (quietly) What does it mean? LOGAN (trying to assimilate its meaning himself) The Lifeclocks have no power outside. \nJessica takes Logan's palm and kisses it. \nJESSICA (with laughter) You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want? \nLOGAN (straight) You know, Jessica. \nJESSICA.

I'll give you one of my favorite cats...a Jellicle cat. (reciting) \"Jellicle cats have cheerful faces, Jellicle cats have bright black eyes; They like to practice their airs and graces And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise.\" \nLOGAN I'm sorry but I don't have anything to give you.

Logan writhes in the chair. F. Again the word NEGATIVE appears on the SCREEN. \nG. \t\t\t\t\t\tA THIRD IDENTICAL HEAD (Logan's Voice) No...There is no Sanctuary. \nH. The SCREEN seems to shimmer. It blinks. \nI. A third time the word negative appears on the SCREEN. \nJ. \t\t\t\t\t\tA FOURTH HEAD (Logan's voice) There is no Sanctuary \nK. The SCREEN'S glow increases...to an almost blinding light... starting to frighten the Sandmen present. \nL. At the same time, we see JESSICA coming out of her tranquilized daze...fearful...still in the Sandmen's custody. \nM.\t\t\t\t\t\tA FIFTH HEAD (Logan's voice) An old man without a crystal...But there is no Sanctuary. \nN. Now the SCREEN is starting to spark. Behind it we SEE the intermittent glow of overheated electronic components. \nO. And we see the word negative...once more on the SCREEN -- but broken now. \nP. \t\t\t\t\t\tA SIXTH HEAD (Logan's voice) There is no Sanctuary. \nQ. Now the noise and the light from the SCREEN are peaking...and we can see the increasing fear of the Sandmen. \nR.

There is no Sanctuary. \nThe sign PROBABILITY bursts...the SIX HEADS of Logan go out. \nThe noise and the light coming out of the screen Increase, as it begins to burst into showers of sparks and flame. \n380-410 \tOUT \n410X1\tANOTHER ANGLE - LOGAN \nStraining twisting, as the light above him bursts, goes out in a puff of smoke -- releasing him. Logan staggers to his feet in time to meet: \n410X2\tSANDMEN \nRushing in from the Ready Room to join the others who have closed in on Logan One holding Jessica. \n410X3\tLOGAN AND SANDMEN Manages to get one of the Sandmen's guns, instantly blasting him with it. In the noise and confusion, the fight becomes general. A Sandman fires back at Logan, misses -- the shot hits one of the Lifeclocks which flares electrically, ribboning out a great arc. Instantly Logan gets off a couple of shots at the other Lifeclocks which similarly flare and burst into violent electrical fire and discharges. \n410X4\tTHE BATTLE \nThe electrical discharges, smoke and noise making great confusion. Sandmen hampered by their own numbers and by trying to miss the machinery. Logan firing methodically at the Lifeclocks, moving. Stumbles over Jessica, prone in the smoke. Helps her to her feet. Crouched, they make for the exit. \n", "test1_input": "As the Stickmen move up and out, we see the exhilarated crowd beginning to pour out of Carousel. \n63X14\t\tLOGAN AND FRANCIS - ARCADE \nDescending from the top level -- not much of a crowd.

Gee the whole burn--try the new psycho-lift-they tell me it turns you inside out... \nHe shoves Logan in that direction and continues on down. \nFRANCIS (calling after him) I'll look for you here when I'm off-- \nAnd he is gone. 63X15\t\tLOGAN \nwaves, smiling, then turns to the Hallucimill. \n63X16\t\tPOV - HALLUCIMILL EXT. \nCrazy, man. \n63X17\t\tBACK TO LOGAN \nHesitates, as a COUPLE push past him gleefully on their way.

He turns and starts making his way downwards towards the exit. \n63X20\t\tLOGAN'S APARTMENT \nAs he enters. Idle, restless. He crosses to a sideboard--makes himself a drink, sips, doesn't like it. Gets rid of it, makes another. He fiddles with things, a game--sits, gets up. Now he is beginning to feel the drink. Takes another belt, smiles. Now he goes over to a tall wall recess flanked by a console with many dials. \n63X21\t\tAT THE WALL RECESS \nAs Logan dials, blurred and smoky images appear in the recess--a slow protoplasmic eddying in many colors. He tunes it in and the figure of a smiling young man appears--bejeweled, lustrous, willing. \n63X22\t\tLOGAN AT THE CONSOLE \nBored as Mastroianni turns the dial again and the young man dissolves. He dials again and now a beautiful young woman takes shape. It is Jessica. 63X23\t\tJESSICA AND LOGAN \nStill in the recess, she makes no gesture of interest, no smile. Around her neck, from a collar, a dangling ankh. It catches Logan's eye. He smiles, clicks another dial and she becomes real. He reaches out a hand and leads her out into the room. \n64\t\tLOGAN AND JESSICA \nAs Jessica turns to him, Logan moves in strongly and embraces her- but, to his surprise, she resists. Logan, still holding her loosely, is amused and surprised. \nLOGAN What's wrong, Available? \nJESSICA (breaking away gently) Please . . .No. \nShe backs away, almost apologetically. Logan follows, smiling. \nLOGAN Please . . . no ? (noting that she looks trapped, he understands) You mean \"not here\"--that's it? You're a private Available but particular, (he is moving in on her as he speaks, she retreating, which amuses him) Don't worry. There's no one here but me. And you. \nJESSICA No. (that stops him) Just no. \nLOGAN You prefer women? \nJESSICA No. \nLOGAN Well then...? \nJESSICA Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake. \nLOGAN Sad? What made you sad? JESSICA A friend of mine went on Carousel tonight. Now he's gone. LOGAN (after a beat) Yes...probably he was renewed? \nJESSICA (flatly) He was killed \nLOGAN Killed? Why do you use that word? \nJESSICA Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill. \nLOGAN I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate  Runners (a beat) Who brought you? \nJESSICA Nobody. I felt sad. .. I put myself on the circuit. \nLOGAN You felt sad. What's your name? \nJESSICA Jessica. \nLOGAN (matter-of-fact) You're beautiful. Let's have sex. JESSICA No. LOGAN Later. \nJESSICA No. \nLOGAN But you put yourself on the circuit! \n", "test1_true": "JESSICA I changed my mind \nLOGAN And now? JESSICA Curious. \nLOGAN About what? JESSICA How a Sandman lives. \nLogan smiles, takes off gunbelt, etc. \nLOGAN Let's have sex. (as Jessica shakes her head) I thought you were curious. JESSICA Not about that. \nLOGAN (after a beat) I'm listening. \nJESSICA I'm afraid to tell you. \nLOGAN (smiling) I'm not armed. (a beat) Well? \nJESSICA Why is it wrong to run? \nLOGAN You shouldn't even think such things... (smiles) And you picked a strange person to say them to - JESSICA I suppose. But what if you want to live? \nLOGAN So? Do what everyone does. Try like hell for renewal. \nLogan stretches out his right hand. We see a red flower crystal embedded and centered in his right palm. It is exactly the same shape that we have seen in black in the palm of the dead runner. \nLOGAN When this turns black...that's it. (laughs) If for any reason you want to be 31... you have the same chance as everyone else...Carrousel. \nLogan takes his gun and points it at her. \nLOGAN \t\t(playfully) But if you're one of the misfits... that's where I come in. \nJESSICA (somewhat frightened) I didn't say that I would run... I Just... \nLOGAN (interrupting; turning over her palm) Are you a 5 or a 6? (we see a green crystal) \nJESSICA Six. I go red next year. \nLOGAN You're years away . . . I don't know why you're thinking of these things, much less talking about them. (offering Jessica the gun) Want to try? \nJessica shakes her head. Logan looks at Jessica carefully...in an admiring sexual way...from her toes to her head...briefly noticing (in the process) chat she is wearing an identical piece of jewelry that he has taken off the dead runner...around her neck. \nLOGAN What Quad do you live in? \nJESSICA K. \nLOGAN (softly) You're sure you don't want to try? \nJessica nods. \nLOGAN It's nice to know you can nod. \nJessica smiles. \nLOGAN It's nice co know you can do that, too. Suddenly Francis and two dishevel led young WOMEN burst in and come laughing toward Logan and Jessica Stoned, hilarious, they crowd around Logan one of them embracing him. In the wild hilarity, Jessica slips away and Logan, seeing her go, makes a vain effort after her. Francis notices, laughs. Amid the noise he shouts to Logan: FRANCIS These are for me -- you've got your own. (looking after Jessica) She must have been something--? At Logan's expression he roars with laughter Francis picks up an atomizer and hurls it at the ceiling where it shatters and a great pink cloud settles over them all. \n64X1\t\tEXT. - SAND MAN H.Q. \nA frowning structure of dark stone and mirrored copper, fronted by broad steps. Logan and Francis are climbing the steps as a SANDMAN is coming out... His uniform is in tatters. They greet one another...then: \nLOGAN What happened to you? \nSANDMAN (embarrassed) I lost a Runner in Cathedral. \nLOGAN How come? \nSANDMAN Ran into some Cubs I couldn't manage. (as they stare) One of them cut me bad... (extends his arm and moves a finger from his shoulder to his wrist) all the way down. FRANCIS (with anger) CUBS! SANDMAN (shrug) On my way to the New You for repairs. \nLOGAN Get yourself a new face while you're at it They know you now. \nThey wave.

You're already beautiful. \nLOGAN No -- it's that last Runner -- someone in 483 was trying to help him. \n64X2\t\tINT. - SANDMAN H.Q. - READY ROOM \nAs Logan and Francis cross the room, Logan nods to other Sandmen, who are monitoring areas of the Megalopolis on video consoles. One of these Sand-men speaks to Francis who hasn't greeted them \nSANDMAN (Monitor) What's with you, Francis?

You're a nice old lady. \nAs soon as she finishes her last sentence, Mary grabs at Jessica's clothing...tearing a pin (piece of Jewelry) off...and running away swiftly. \nAs Jessica instinctively starts after her...Logan... holds her back. \nLOGAN (shaking his head) Not here. Might be a decoy. \nCautiously, Logan and Jessica exit from the wall, stepping out into- \n125\t\tEXT. - CATHEDRAL ITSELF \nAn area of rubble and dilapidated buildings. \nLogan crouches, holding the transceiver and fanning the area, listening... \nSOUND: a soft beeping which abruptly grows louder and holds steady. \nLogan gestures to Jessica to follow him, and moves carefully in the direction of the BEEPING, quartering occasionally like a hunting dog. Coming up to an angle of wall, he stops, flicks the sound off, puts the machine back onto his belt. He gestures to Jessica to stand still then he straightens, steps out, calls: \nLOGAN Runner! \nSilence. Jessica involuntarily moves to him and as she does, the Runner moves from behind an upright and stands.- The figure is shadowed, the arms out, palms facing in a kind of gesture of surrender. In the Runner's left hand, the tiny red crystal pulses on and off. The Runner is a woman! \nThere is an instant of frozen confrontation and then suddenly Jessica gasps, grasping at him. As Logan whirls: 125X1\t\tANOTHER ANGLE \nSuddenly, from everywhere out of the shadows, a pack of snarling Cubs materializes--moving with blinding speed. At their appearance the Runner whirls and races off into the dark shadows. Logan makes a futile gesture after her, then turns to face the Cubs. \nA strutting, feral-faced fourteen or fifteen year old heads the pack, dressed in fierce-looking tatters and hung with rip-off trophies. He gestures to one of his followers to stand still. \nBILLY (speaking of the Runner) Don't worry about her. We'll have that one later. Right now I think we've got a Runner and his pairup. And what a Runner! \nThe CAMERA PANS the other Cubs...mean, filthy. \nA VOICE We're going to have ourselves a time, we are. Right, Billy?! \nThere is a chilling laughter of agreement from the rest. \nLOGAN I'm a Sandman! \nBILLY I cut up a Sandman yesterday.  They said I'd never get him...but I cut him up good, I did. \nLOGAN (firm tone) I feel sorry for you, boy! \nSome murmuring as the pack watches their leader. \nBILLY For me? Better feel sorry for your- self, Sandman! \nLOGAN No, for you! How old are you, Billy? \nBilly is silent. \nLOGAN Fourteen? Fifteen? Your days are running out. How long can you last? A year. Six months? (he points to the yellow flower in Billy's palm) What happens when you're sixteen and you go green? \nBILLY (lashing out) Nothing will happen! I make the rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say! Always have! Always will! I got Cathedral and I'll never let go! \nLOGAN No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever heard of a cub with a green flower? You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here. (slightest beat) If you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart! \nBILLY Shut up! Shut up your damn mouth! \nLogan falls back into a fighting crouch...but before he can strike a blow..he is grabbed and slammed against the wall of an abandoned building. \nANOTHER VOICE Let him suck Muscle! That'll shut his mouth! Let's watch him shake himself to death!! We see the Cubs take out drugpads. They squeeze the pads and inhale the \"Muscle.\" At once their movements become blurringly rapid. They take menacing positions - some leaping overhead. A VOICE Give him some Muscle!! Like lightning they change positions and flash around Logan and Jessica 126\t\tCLOSE ON - JESSICA \nWatching..terrified. \n127\t\tCLOSE ON - LOGAN Being held against the wall by Cubs as: ANOTHER VOICE Shake him to death!! \n", "test2_true": "128\t\tANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING BILLY moving a drugpad against Logan's face. \nLogan is holding his breath...desperately trying not to breathe the \"Muscle\" directly from the pad into his system. \nBILLY (chilling laugh) He's trying to hold his breath... \nAs Billy presses the pad tighter against Logan's face: \nWith all his might, Logan wrenches his arms loose... drops to the ground and pulls out his gun. \nHe fires and fire girdles a pillar...and they start to back away. \nBILLY We can rush him...we can take can take him\tagain, we can!! \nThe pack hesitates...stops backing away. \nLOGAN (moving the gun slowly back and forth) All right! How many of you want this to be Lastday?! \nThe pack moves back again...and  disperses, leaving Billy facing Logan alone. \nLOGAN Come on, Billy...come on...you cut a Sandman, didn't you?! \nLogan tucks the gun back into his waist. \nLOGAN Come on, Billy...cut me...Come on \nAfter a beat, Billy turns and runs away. \nLogan comforts the shivering Jessica for a moment then takes out the small box from his pocket and turns it...until it starts BEEPING. \nThe CAMERA PANS Logan and Jessica...following the SOUND. \nThey move over the rubble...and cautiously around abandoned buildings. \nWe HEAR A SCREAM...and HEAR the Cubs who've only obviously found and attacked someone. The SOUND is coming from a different direction than where the beeping is coming from. \nLOGAN (shaking his head) They've got someone else! Why would anybody come here? \nJessica shudders as the scream dies abruptly. \nThe BEEPING is now very loud. \nLogan homes in on an abandoned building, enters, crosses swiftly to a door inside and kicks it down. \nWe SEE the Runner.

WOMAN I'll kill you!! I'll kill you!! \nAfter Logan pushes her away...and she falls down: \nLOGAN (breathing hard) I'm not going to hurt you. \nSlowly, she rises. \nLogan takes out the ankh. \nLOGAN Sanctuary? Anything? \nLogan reaches into his pocket and takes out a small round object...the size of a large marble. \nLOGAN If they find you throw this hard enough to break it. Then hold your breath till you get away...It's blind gas. \nHer reaction is blank, then, with desperate ferocity she attacks Logan again. \nDuring the course of the struggle, Logan subdues her again. \nJessica enters, bends over the near-crazed Runner as Logan holds her.

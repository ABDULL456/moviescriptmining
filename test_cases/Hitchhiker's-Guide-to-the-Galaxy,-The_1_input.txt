FORD (CONT'D) We've got to get off this ship before the Vogons find us. Vogons hate hitchhikers. Which is why they make ships with walls that won't allow the Sub-Etna signal to pass through. So we've got to send the signal up and out if we wanna catch a ride. Pull. 
They both pull. A section of pipe snaps off. Steam shoots out. Ford holds the black Thumb under the pipe. 
ARTHUR What's a Vogon? 
FORD Ask the guide.    Say "Vogons." 
Ford continues turning dials.        Arthur lifts the Guide. 
ARTHUR "Vogons." 
The word "VOGONS" floats up into his field of vision. 
GUIDE VOICE Vogons.

CHARACTER, HISTORY, HOW TO HAVE FUN WITH, HOW TO ANNOY, WHAT TO AVOID. Arthur touches CHARACTER. 
GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D) Vogons are one of the most unpleasant races in the Galaxy - not evil, but bad- tempered, bureaucratic, officious and callous. They wouldn't even lift a finger to save their own grandmothers from the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal without orders signed in triplicate, sent in, sent back, queried, lost, found, subjected to public inquiry, lost again, and finally buried in soft peat for three months and recycled as fire-lighters. 
Arthur touches 'HOW TO HAVE FUN WITH.' 
GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D) The best way to get a drink out of a Vogon is to stick your finger down his throat. 
Arthur touches 'WHAT TO AVOID'. 
GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D) On no account should you allow a Vogon to read poetry to you. 
FORD They can't think, they can't imagine, most of them can't even spell. They just run things. (turns dial opposite direction) And if we don't get a ride soon, you won't b need the guide to illustrate just how unpleasant the Vogons can be. They've destroyed a planet today, that always makes them a little feisty. 
ARTHUR It can't be gone. It can't be! (grabbing the Guide, shouting} Earth! 
FORD Shhh! 
ARTHUR EARTH!! 
GUIDE VOICE Earth. 
An image of the Earth appears on the Guide's screen. 
GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D) Harmless. 
Arthur waits...and waits.    The Earth image fades away.

ARTHUR That's it? That's all this idiotic book has to say about my home? "Harmless?" 
FORD Hey, there are a hundred billion stars in the Galaxy and only a limited amount of space in the book's microprocessors. No one knew much about Earth. That's why I was there. To expand the entry. I fired off a new one to the editor before I got stranded. 
ARTHUR What does it say now? 
FORD Mostly harmless. 
Before Arthur can react, a speaker HUMS to life with screeching HOWLS and GARGLES. Arthur cups his ears. 
ARTHUR Ahhh, what the hell is that?! 
FORD Here.   Put this in your ear. 
Ford removes a small yellow fish from his pouch. He moves to put it in Arthur's ear. Arthur struggles. 
ARTHUR WHAT?...STOP!..DON'T COME NEAR ME WITH... 
The LOUD GARGLING NOISE continues. Ford has to wrestle to get the fish in Arthur's ear. 
JELTZ (ON SPEAKER) 
ARTHUR Argh!   What's happening...? 
As he succeeds, the noise mutates to the Vogon Captain's voice. Arthur looks incredulous. 
JELTZ (ON SPEAKER) This is your captain speaking, so stop whatever you're doing and pay attention! 
FORD The fish. It's translating for you. 
JELTZ (ON SPEAKER) According to our instruments we have unwittingly picked up a couple of hitchhikers who must be apprehended and...

Arthur doesn't want to hear any of this...pulls the fish back out of his ear.

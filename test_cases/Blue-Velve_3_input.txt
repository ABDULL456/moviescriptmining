JEFFREY Nobody. 
DOROTHY Shit. You better tell me something. 
JEFFREY I was. an experiment. Just to see if I could do it. 
DOROTHY An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before. 
JEFFREY I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you. 
DOROTHY Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME. 
JEFFREY (scared, nervous) . I saw you come in, talk on the phone. get undressed.

JEFFREY (trying to remember) You said hello. to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone?. Don?. and little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. and something about a Meadow Lane. something in an hour. I don't remember any more. 
Dorothy stares at Jeffrey studying him for some time thinking. 
DOROTHY That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what? 
JEFFREY Well. 
DOROTHY THEN WHAT? 
JEFFREY Then you got undressed. 
DOROTHY How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress? 
JEFFREY (quietly; feeling guilty) Never before this. 
DOROTHY How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you. (gets an idea) Get undressed. I want to see you. 
JEFFREY No. Come on. 
DOROTHY NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you. 
JEFFREY Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave. 
DOROTHY No way. 
Dorothy moves to the kitchen counter and gets a knife.  She goes to Jeffrey.  Now she has a knife and a gun.  He's scared. 
DOROTHY Get undressed. I want to see you. 
Jeffrey begins to undress. First he takes off his shoes and socks, Then his shirt.  He undoes his belt and unzips his pants and takes them off.  Now he is only in his underwear. 
DOROTHY STAND UP. 
He does. 
DOROTHY (continuing) Come closer. 
Dorothy has a strange look on her face.  She reaches out and pulls Jeffrey's underpants down to his knees.  She looks at him. 
DOROTHY (whispering) What do you want from me? 
JEFFREY (quietly, getting very hot) I . I don't know. 
DOROTHY (whispering) What do you want? 
Dorothy is getting very DREAMY and begins to talk in a childlike voice. She opens her robe and pulls Jeffrey to her breasts. 
DOROTHY Don't move. don't look at me. 
Jeffrey's eyes close with nervous ecstasy as Dorothy begins touching him. 
DOROTHY Do you like that? 
JEFFREY Yes. 
He tries to touch her. 
DOROTHY Don't move or I'll kill you. 
She looks at him. 
DOROTHY (continuing) Do you like talk like that? 
JEFFREY No. 
DOROTHY Lie down on the bed. 
He lies down.  He looks frightened.

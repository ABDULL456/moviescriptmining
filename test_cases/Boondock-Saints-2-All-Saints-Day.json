Connor dips in a finger and tastes. \nCONNOR (CONT'D) It's heroin. \nMURPHY How the fuck would you know? \nCONNOR Fuck you.    I know shit. \nINT. WAREHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER \nRomeo's winging it, jerky moves, grinding gears as the forklift staggers across the mammoth warehouse toward the gangsters at the opposing end. The crate blocks Romeo from view. He's driving blind as the rickety crate jiggles on the forks. \nINSIDE CRATE:   Connor and Murphy are sardined, back to back. \nMURPHY Jesus!    What the fuck's he doin'?! \nCONNOR He can't see where he's goin'! \nMurphy peaks through a crack. \nMURPHY Shit!    Tell him to go left, now! \nConnor puts his mouth to a knot hole. \nCONNOR Go left!    Go left! \nROMEO What?! \nConnor sticks his finger out the hole and points. Romeo wrenches the wheel and they narrowly avoid machinery. The crate rocks... \nMURPHY I can't fuckin' believe I let you talk me into this! This is a stupid plan! \nCONNOR I didn't notice you throwin' out any ideas, ya creative asshole! \nMURPHY Fuck you! \nThe boys start elbowing each other in a close quarters scrap while hurling obscenities. \nROMEO Hey!   What's goin' on in there?! \nINSIDE CRATE: Murphy suddenly stops, eyes wide as he looks through the crack. They are headed for a \"Mechanic's Well.\"   A long, rectangular cement hole in the floor six feet deep. \nMURPHY Jesus Christ! Tell him to stop! \nConnor slams his mouth to the knot hole. \nCONNOR \nBRAKES!   BRAKES! BRAKES! \nA few of the Chinese turn as Romeo slams on the brakes, screeching to a halt just before the well. The crate slides right off and falls in, disappears from sight. CRASH! \nA large cloud of coffee dust plumes.   A wide eyed Romeo is exposed. The Asian gangsters stare in shock. \nHard techno music! Suddenly, Romeo whips it in reverse, cranks the wheel guns it and navigates the well. Speeds toward the gangsters. \nMECHANIC'S WELL: (SLO-MO) The brothers burst from the debris, covered in coffee grounds and white powder. They draw their weapons and walk toward the ramp at the well's opposing end. \nThe Chinese pull and start firing. Romeo dives off and rolls behind some machines. The lift continues on target. \nThe brothers emerge and tear right in, firing at the gangsters. Romeo fires his useless 22. In the ensuing fire fight the brothers kill all but Chinese Gangster #3. \nThe forklift crashes through the table with the stacked heroin. \nSLO-MO: The brothers slam the final Gangster to his knees and level to the back of his head and recite the following in synchronicity... \nBROTHERS And shepherds we shall be, for Thee, my Lord, for Thee. Power hath descended forth from Thy hand, that our feet may swiftly carry out Thy command. So, we shall flow a river forth to Thee and teeming with souls shall it ever be. \n(MORE) \nBROTHERS (CONT'D) In Nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti. \nPOP!   POP!    They kill him.   DIP TO BLACK... \nINT. WAREHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER \nHaunting music. Black and White film as Connor and Murphy take great care in ritualizing the bodies. They place pennies in eyes and cross hands over chests. WHIP PAN... \nEXT. BACK TO PRESENT, WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT \nBodies are wheeled out in the b.g. as Dolly and Greenly talk privately with Eunice. \nDOLLY Just got a call from my best snitch. Never steered me wrong. He says its this guy. (hands Eunice mug) \"Gorgeous\" George Tuffano. He's trusted bruglione to Yakavetta but not blood. He's been left control of the streets. He's running all of it. \n", "test1_true": "GREENLY They call him \"Gorgeous\" cuz he likes his silk suits and jewelry. He's even got the 'out of season' fake bake going on, a real peacock, this guy. \nEUNICE Yeah, I heard of this rodeo clown. Duffy approaches, hands Eunice a tiny bullet in a baggy. \nDUFFY Ballistics just dug it out. \nThey all look perplexed. \nEUNICE A twenty two? You gotta be kidding me. That's like bringing a knife to a gunfight. \nGREENLY Yeah, or like bringing a really small gun...to a gunfight. \nThey all blank stare Greenly for a moment.        Moving on. \nDUFFY I don't know. Ballistics is reading three shooters. This is one of them. \nEUNICE Well, I'm having a hard time believing that one of the three most lethal individuals on the planet just switched over to bird shot. \nDOLLY Maybe we're reading it wrong. The priest was a frame job, right? \nDUFFY Yeah, maybe somebody's trying to eliminate some competition here. \nEunice considers this.   The Detectives seem hopeful. \nEUNICE No, sir. It's them. But we just might have ourselves a change in the line up, here. \nThe detectives all look at one another nervously. \nGREENLY Fine, they're back.   What's the plan? \nEUNICE Hell, we've just been called up to the big show. We are tracking multiple perpetrators, gentlemen. The plan? We keep our ear to the ground and try to figure out where Yakavetta's hiding. Napoleon. We find him and flip him. And as for the Saints...I'm gonna have me a face to face with these boys one way or the other. \nShe walks off.   The cops look terrified. \nDOLLY Holy...fucking...shit. \nINT. GREENHOUSE -- NIGHT \nWe see the hands of an OLD MAN (70) as he mists flowers in this lush environment. He ambles to a shop table, wearing a metal leg brace, circa 1950's and a corrective shoe, Polio. We do not see his face. \nCLOSE ON: small black and white TV on table.     Breaking news.    Live from the crime scene... \nREPORTER #3 Law enforcement has confirmed the Saints are back! \nThis gives way to... \nINT. / EXT. NEWS FOOTAGE \nThe Saints pencil composites are shown.     From the studio... \nREPORTER #1 V.O. It's confirmed. The five drug traffickers all involved in the heroin trade were victims of the Saints. \nSTATIC!   CHANEL CHANGES!    Bodies are wheeled out... \nREPORTER #2 V.O. ...several having close ties to the Yakavetta Crime Family, confirming the long suspected merger of the Chinese Triad and the Mafia. \nEXT. ALLEY -- LATER \nCLOSE ON:   A metal door opens revealing DOC (60's). \nDOC \nBOYS! \nThe brothers and Doc hug and greet as he ushers them in with Romeo in tow. The bar is closed, empty. \nDOC (CONT'D) Jesus, Mary and Joseph! I saw da nuh, nuh, news channel. Are ya boys all right?! \nCONNOR Sound as an Irish pound, Doc. \nMURPHY Is it too late for a shot? \nDOC Oh, the Lord told me you'd be comin! He said, \"Doc, they're comin\" and I was ta get everting ready. So I did. Everting's ruh, ruh, ruh, it's all set. \nROMEO Uh, hem! \nMURPHY Oh, this is our Mexican. \nDOC (shaking hands) How are ya, lad? They call me...FUCK!...ASS! \nROMEO Nice to meet you, Fuck Ass, I'm Romeo. \nINT. UPSTAIRS STORE ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER \n", "test1_id": 1449, "test2_input": "Eunice denotes the bodies. \nEUNICE This...simply won't do. We made a deal. The big fish step in if your body count gets too high and... (re: carnage) ...you have been very naughty boys. \nRockin' music overtakes as we DISSOLVE TO... \nINT. EL CAVA -- LATER \nWith Eunice directing them, the boys and Romeo restage the crime scene. With a squeegee they move pools of blood across the linoleum floor and re-position bodies. \nThe boys wrap Jo Jo's body in a tarp and put it in the Green Machine. Romeo creates blood splatter with a turkey baster. \nRomeo and the brothers place the guns they used in the hands of dead gangsters as Eunice drops bullet casings in carefully chosen spots. \nRomeo and the brothers leave with the utensils used to rig the scene. The music fades, leaving Eunice in the center of... \nINT. EL CAVA -- LATER \nSilence. She removes her ear plugs and the sound returns. We are on a very different looking scene. CSI, forensics, even Dolly and Duffy wait with baited breath. Greenly is not present. \nEUNICE O'kay.   Here's how it all went down. \nDolly and Duffy open their notepads. \nINT. FLASHBACK, EL CAVA -- NEVER \nNorthside stands facing off with the Southside. All brugliones are frozen in place. Eunice saunters down the middle. Cool music... \nEUNICE A secret gathering of the Brugliones. The topic of discussion? Weak leadership and betrayal. \nN.S. BRUGLIONE #1 Yakavetta's hiding from these Jesus Freaks and making us look like pussies. \nS.S. BRUGLIONE #1 And he's hanging all of us out to dry to boot. \nA pause as they size each other up. \nN.S. BRUGLIONE #2 All right.   I'll be the first to say it. \nEUNICE The enemy of my enemy is my friend. So, even with all their old vendettas... \nN.S. BRUGLIONE #2 ...I say fuck the Yakavettas. \nEUNICE And there it is. Guess what comes next. \nEunice points to men as he moves down the line. \nEUNICE (CONT'D) Red Rover.   Red Rover. \nS.S. BRUGLIONE #2 We're taking over. \nEUNICE Ah. Easier uttered than accomplished. The North End and the South End may as well be the Hetfields and the McCoys. These fellas...they just don't get on. \nAll the Brugliones yell over one another. \nN.S. BRUGLIONE #3 Fuck you! The North End built that racket from the ground up! \nS.S. BRUGLIONE #3 South End's been carrying your fucking asses for years! \nN.S. BRUGLIONE #3 15 percent?! In your dreams, asshole! \nS.S. BRUGLIONE #3 Whoa! Just went up to twenty, fuck stick! \nS.S. Brulione #1 flashes a gun in his waist band. \nS.S. BRUGLIONE #1 You want some of this, you mutt?! \nN.S. Bruglione #1 pulls his weapon. \nN.S. BRUGLIONE #1 Let's see what you got! \nThey all pull and level at one another. They freeze in place and all yelling ceases as Eunice walks down the middle. \nEUNICE Oh, the cliche. A Mexican stand off in a Mexican restaurant. \nEunice looks deeply at all the men as she turns a slow circle. \nEUNICE (CONT'D) They cut each other to pieces...and nobody walked away. Who knows who fired first. Could have been any one of them. But somebody let it loose. (pointing to men) And duck, duck, duck... \nEunice stands before S.S. Brulione #2. \nEUNICE (CONT'D) Goose. \nBOOM! They all start shooting as Eunice stands in the crossfire unaffected. Men fall dead and we see the relevance of each thing Eunice did to doctor the scene. WHIP PAN... \nINT. BACK TO PRESENT, EL CAVA -- LATER \n", "test2_true": "(MORE) \nEUNICE (CONT'D) They're fighting over his throne.      This was not the work of the Saints. \nHeads nod agreement.   Greenly enters and flashes a file to Eunice. \nEXT. EL CAVA -- MOMENTS LATER \nPress clamors for the story in the b.g. Eunice and the detectives are in a private spot. Greenly excitedly hands her the file. \nGREENLY INTERpol came through. \nEunice opens the file.   Picture of Crew Cut.    Dolly and Duffy read over her shoulder. \nGREENLY (CONT'D) You were right. Five foot five.       Gotta be the shooter. \nEunice smiles and speaks to Crew Cut's photo... \nEUNICE Are you ready for your fifteen minutes, Sweetheart? \nGREENLY That ain't all. Short stuff's work visa was signed by a sponsor that doesn't exist and look at the date. Two months after Nine Eleven. \nEUNICE Someone maneuvered it through the system using false information during the highest alert in U.S. history. \nDOLLY Yakavetta's just a gangster. He ain't got the juice to pull that off. \nEUNICE You're darn tootin' he don't. \nGREENLY INS red flagged it like a motherfucker. It's a shit storm. \nEUNICE Something stanks like manure. \nThe cops nod.   Eunice turns and starts to move away... \nEUNICE (CONT'D) We got someplace to be! Let's go! \nINT. MERCEDES -- MOMENTS LATER \nEunice drives.    The Detectives look nervous. \nDOLLY What is this? Where are we going? \nEUNICE It's time to revisit the scene of the crime. \nEXT. MCGINTY'S PUB -- LATER \nEunice pulls to a stop. At the sight of the place, the cops turn white as a ghost. All exit the vehicle and walk toward. \nGREENLY It's after hours. I mean, if you wanted a drink then... \nEUNICE 37 bodies later and we're finally back where it all began. Y'ever heard of the southern expression, \"We have an elephant in the living room?\" \nShe knocks on the door.   The cops are mortified. \nEUNICE (CONT'D) Hope you fellas brought some peanuts. \nDoc opens it and lets them all into... \nINT. MCGINTY'S -- CONTINUOUS \nConnor and Murphy are seated at the bar. They turn.   The cops are dumbfounded. Duffy turns to Eunice, mystified. \nDUFFY You knew all along. \nCONNOR What?    Ya don't call.   Ya don't write. \nDolly actually drops to his knees in abject relief. Greenly laughs and plants a kiss on Eunice's cheek. Doc pours shots. Eunice smiles as all her guys hug and make merry. DISSOLVE TO... \nINT. MCGINTY'S -- LATER \nDoc smiles from the bar as the group raises for a toast. \nMURPHY I'm glad we got the band back together... (re: Romeo) ...even though our new bass player's kind of a retard. \nThey all laugh, cheers and drink. Conversations buzz all around. Eunice chats with the boys as she sips a cosmo. \nCONNOR So, where'd you learn ta shoot like that? \nEUNICE My Daddy was an old six gun shooter.      A real cowboy. \nMURPHY Guess that makes you a cowgirl, eh? Thanks. Saved our asses. \nEUNICE Don't mention it. Now, we have a little business to go over before you celebrate in earnest. \n", "test2_id": 1450, "test3_input": "The boys look to each other.   Eyes wide. \nMURPHY Maybe we should. \nCONNOR You're sure, Roc? You know this? \nRocco smiles. \nROCCO No...I   just have faith. And for a second   there, you almost did too. Y'see,   it's contagious. And if enough people   catch it...look out, baby. \nA roaring cheer arises, shaking the very foundations of the arena. The boys turn in awe. The stands are still empty. \nINT. LIVING ROOM -- LATER \nThey jolt awake and look to each other. \nCONNOR While the wicked stand confounded... \nMURPHY ...call me with Thy Saints surrounded. \nEXT. BOSTON COMMONS, JOGGING TUNNEL -- MORNING \nPoppa M stands before Eunice.   She hands him an envelope. \nEUNICE He lives in York Maine. About 30 minutes from here. Better go quick. I logged on to an FBI database to get the info. Homeland Security does internal monitoring now. Only a matter of time before they flag it. \nPOPPA M Will they know it's you? (she nods) Will you be all right, dear? \nEUNICE I hear Costa Rica's nice. \nShe looks at him as her eyes well up with tears. \nEUNICE (CONT'D) I never thought I'd ask this of another human being but please...kill this man. \nShe is overcome and weeps.   Poppa M holds her. \nPOPPA M It ends taday. \nINT. FBI HEAD QUARTERS, BOSTON BRANCH, KITCHENETTE -- LATER \nKuntsler pours a coffee. G-man #2 comes in holding a piece of paper. \nKUNTSLER Anybody word from Bloom, yet? \nG-MAN #2 Nothing. \nKUNTSLER I want that little Bayou Bitch in here. Something stinks about this whole thing. \nG-MAN #2 I'm having D.H.S. dump her IP and check for flags. See if she's been poking around. \nINT. TRINITY CHURCH -- LATER \nPoppa M, the brothers and Romeo walk kneel at the altar before a memorial to McKinney: Candles, pictures, cards, flowers etc. \nAs they pray, a dozen or so church patrons who are in the pews begin to realize who they are. Our foursome stands and walks back down the aisle. They make eye contact with a few people. \nWhen the Saints are gone, the churchgoers gather in the aisle and stare at the front door in disbelief. Excited whisperings. One guy opens his cell phone. Then he thinks...and closes it. \nINT. FBI HEAD QUARTERS -- MOMENTS LATER \nG-man #2 excitedly gives Kuntsler a file.   His eyes widen. \nINT. INTERROGATION ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER \nKuntsler slaps the file down in front of Jimmy who is cuffed to a metal table. He looks at a picture of the Roman. Fear. \nINT. SUV -- MOMENTS LATER \nKuntsler and his men speed along sirens blaring.    Into walkie... \nKUNTSLER This is S.A.I.C., Jonathan Buford Kuntsler! Security code A4153B! I need an immediate R2 law enforcement override clearance! \nFEDERAL OPERATOR V.O. What is your specific request, Agent? \nKUNTSLER Everyone in the tri-state area with a gun! \nINT. DEAD END STREET -- SAME TIME \nThe Roman's common, two story home looms in the b.g. at the end of a cul-de-sac. Walking down the middle of the street, is Poppa M: black trench, hat, dark shades. He opens the door and enters the... \nINT. COMMON HOME -- CONTINUOUS \nPoppa M listens, far off scratchy music. He moves quietly through the house, stopping at the foot of the stairs...listens. He removes his rosary, hangs it on the banister and moves on, pulling a weapon. \nINT. GREENHOUSE -- SAME TIME \n", "test3_true": "The Roman sits in front of a sunken fire pit at a low flame. Across the pit, an empty chair. Extended before him is a stunning garden, standing in stark contrast to the common house: vines, flowers, cobblestone walks, fountains. The center piece is a Turkish pool with pure white Lillys afloat. Poppa M slowly approaches the Roman from behind. He holsters his weapon and sits. The Roman halts the phonograph. \nPOPPA M Hello, Louie. \nROMAN Noah. \nLong pause. \nPOPPA M We haven't much time. \nThe Roman smiles and gestures the surroundings. \nROMAN My garden. She is beautiful, yes?     Ah, but you. You are blind to beauty.     You are a destroyer, Noah. \nPOPPA M You know my reasons.   You know why I did what I did. \nROMAN But do you? You think it was for your father? No. You were born a killer. Death...is in the very blood that runs through your veins. \nPOPPA M No. \nROMAN Then explain this. \nThe Roman flicks a photo over. It lands in Poppa M's lap.    It is the picture we saw earlier. A woman holding two babies. \nROMAN (CONT'D) You were not there to raise them. Not a single day. Yet, how closely they follow in the footsteps of their father. They have inherited your blood, Noah...your anger. \nPoppa M looks at the photo deeply. \nEXT. BEHIND GREENHOUSE -- SAME TIME \nOutside, back wall of greenhouse.    THUGs 1-5 from Patronazzi, hunker down here. They are all armed. \nTHUG #1 (whispered into walkie) Remember, not a scratch on the Old Man. \nINT. PARLOR, UPSTAIRS -- SAME TIME \nWe look out the bay windows. It is a straight shot down the slanted roof to the roof of the greenhouse. THUGS 6-8 stand quietly inside. \nTHUG #6 Got it.   Wait for the signal. \nINT. HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER \nA gloved hand grabs up Poppa M's rosary.    Connor pockets it as he and Murphy silently climb the stairs. \nINT. / EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS -- SAME TIME \nS.W.A.T. teams load into vans.   Squad cars speed through traffic. \nINT. GREENHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER \nPoppa M tosses the picture into the fire. \nPOPPA M And you?   What are you? \nThe Roman denotes his garden. \nROMAN I am a creator. You see? Our very natures stood in opposition as old as the story of the scorpion and the frog. \nPOPPA M Why...did you sell me out, Louie? \nROMAN You can never understand. \nPOPPA M 25 years....try me. \nROMAN I wanted to join with them. They were building an empire. Creating something and I was helping them! I used you, Noah, to eliminate their problems, to destroy their competition, to cut out their cancers. I earned my place among them. \nPoppa M looks around. \nPOPPA M Is this your place among them? Because all I see is a an old man, sitting in a garden. \nROMAN Alas, the scorpion and the frog both lost everything, yes? I should have paid more attention to the story. \n(MORE) \nROMAN (CONT'D) Without you...I was no longer useful to them. They cast me out! \nINT. SUV -- MOMENTS LATER \nKuntsler barks into a walkie... \nKUNTSLER The location is to be surrounded and secured upon arrival! Nobody goes in! \nHe suddenly looks out his window to the sky.    In the distance, two other copters fly in the same direction. \n", "test3_id": 1451}

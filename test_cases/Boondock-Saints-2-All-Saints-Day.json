{"train": "ALL SAINTS DAY \nWritten by \nTroy Duffy \nSeptember 1, 2007 \nEXT. BOYLESTON STREET, BOSTON -- MORNING \nThe boulevard is empty, eerie silence. No cars, no people. A man walks down the middle of the street, long trench, dark shades. Though he does not speak, we hear... \nMAN V.O. There's two kinds of people in this world when you boil it all down. You got your talkers and you got your doers. \nWe recognize this man as ROCCO. He crosses Copley Square toward the looming dome of the Trinity Church. \nROCCO V.O. Most people are just talkers. All they got is talk. But when all's said and done, it is the doers who change the world. And when they do that, they change us. That's why we never forget them...So, which one are you? Do you just talk about it? Or do you stand up and do something about it? Because believe you me all the rest of it is just coffee house bullshit. \nFADE TO BLACK... \nEXT. DEEP COUNTRYSIDE -- DAY \nSUBTEXT:   \"Ireland\" \nFrom behind we see two men perched atop a boulder. A flock of sheep encircles them. Their army sacks and shotguns are nearby. They roll their own cigarettes with effortless synchronicity and light up. CONNOR and MURPHY MacMANUS (30's) now have long hair with heavy facial growth. Rugged. Piercing eyes. Looking to the horizon... \nMURPHY Looks like a storm's comin'. \nCONNOR Aye. \nEXT. FIELDS -- LATER \nMOODY MUSIC: The brothers drive the flock across jewel green hills. Murphy cuts a sheep from a thicket and sets it off. \nPOPPA M V.O. Peace, they say, is the enemy of memory. So it had been for my boys. \nConnor shares some jerky with a sheep dog as the flock surges. \nPOPPA M V.O. (CONT'D) For some time now, their past had felt like a dream to them...faded and worn. \nMurphy touches the faded Celtic Cross tattoo on his forearm. Connor sees. The music takes us to a secluded, pioneer-esque ranch. \nCLOSE ON: POPPA M's (58yrs) face as he coughs and watches his sons approach from his rocking chair on the porch. \nPOPPA M V.O. (CONT'D) And then suddenly, as if not a day had passed...it was back. I could see it in their eyes. \nINT. FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT \nPoppa M and his sons eat a rustic dinner.   It storms outside. \nPOPPA M V.O. I could feel it, heavy in their presence. Something calling them back. \nPoppa M looks to his boys who just keep eating. DIP TO BLACK... \nINT. FARMHOUSE, FRONT PORCH -- NEXT MORNING \nVery early dawn, shadowy morning light. Connor and Murphy sip coffees and look out into the rain. Lightening lights up the flock. \nThrough the open door behind them, Poppa M stokes a warm fire. \nConnor touch the Celtic Cross tattoo on his forearm. The boys look at each other as the rain suddenly stops and all the \"little sounds\" of morning cease. Something's amiss. Thunder. Ominous music as... \nEXT. BOSTON, TRINITY CHURCH -- NIGHT \nFrom behind, we see a man with a CREW CUT, staring at the dome of the Trinity. \nSLO-MO, CLOSE ON: Crew Cut's boots as he paces toward.    The threatening music bleeds over to... \nEXT. FARM -- MOMENTS LATER \nJust inside the trees, a pack of wolves stalk the sheep flock... \nSLO-MO, CLOSE ON:   A wolf's paws as it paces toward... \nWe intercut between BOSTON and IRELAND as chaos erupts... \nBOSTON:    Crew Cut quickly enters the church. \nIRELAND:    The wolves burst from the tree line. \nBOSTON: A frantic priest in his 50's weeps and begs as Crew Cut slams him to his knees with a .9 mm to his head. \nIRELAND:   The wolves savagely attack the screaming sheep. \nBOSTON:    Muzzle flash, blood splatters on the altar. \nEXT. RAPID FLASHBACK SEQUENCE, \"ACCESSORY TO MURDER\" \nGreenly, disguised as a correctional officer, lets Connor, Murphy and Poppa M out of a paddywagon. FLASH! \nThe Saints enter the Suffolk Courthouse, undetected.   FLASH! \nDolly, dressed as a civilian, pulls the fire alarm.    FLASH! \nThe Saints execute Poppa Joe Yakavetta before many terrified witnesses, the alarm blaring in the b.g. FLASH! \nINT. BACK TO PRESENT, VESTIBULE -- MOMENTS LATER \nGREENLY ...and not just fucked, like elephant dick, pounded in the ass, no reach around, jungle fucked! \nDUFFY Now's not the time to panic, Green beans! \nGREENLY Oh, I disagree. Now's the perfect time to panic. We're all Accessories to... \nDOLLY Don't you fucking say it! \nThey all argue over one another. OFFICER #1 peaks his head in the front door. The detectives grind to a halt. \nOFFICER #1 Her E.T.A. is ten minutes. \nEXT. GRAVEYARD -- MORNING \nCLOSE ON:   a gravestone.   \"Paul M. Smecker,    1956 - 2003\" \nWe reveal a pair of sexy female legs, expensive \"Jimmy Choo\" heels. From behind we see the woman rest a rose at Smecker's Grave. \"Legs\" turns and walks toward a waiting squad car in b.g. \nEXT. CHURCH -- MOMENTS LATER \nDolly, Duffy and Greenly stand outside in the entry way of the church. Though still on edge, they have calmed. \nDOLLY I didn't even know he had a protege. What is this bullshit? \nDuffy whips out his trusty note pad. \nDUFFY Special Agent Eunice Bloom, 32 years old. Smecker plucked her right out of class at Quantico. \nGREENLY Smecker hand picked her? Aw, man. This brawd's gonna be a nightmare. \nDUFFY She was assigned to OCD two years back. She can shoot a gun, set three course records during her training. \nGREENLY Great. A bull dike, Annie Oakley wanna- be. We gotta get rid of her. \nDUFFY She is also an authority on the Saints case. Which means Smecker must have walked her through it. \nThe cops suddenly flush with fear. \nDOLLY And the hits just keep on comin'. \nINT. FARMHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER \nSibeal waits as Poppa M thinks, then shakes his head. \nPOPPA M Naw...I'm in no condition.   I'd just slow 'em down. \nSIBEAL Well, are ya at least gonna try ta talk them out of this? \nPoppa M shakes his head. \nSIBEAL (CONT'D) We don't even know what this is yet! Somebody could just be tryin' ta get away with murder here! \nPOPPA M Aye. Only there's about a thousand easier ways ta do that. Trust me. Someone's callin' them out, Sibeal. Ya kill a priest in a church and make it look like they did it. Bring 'em back with a vengeance. Don't know who. Don't know why. But someone thinks he's real fuckin' clever. Only one problem with his little plan. \nSIBEAL What's dat? \nPOPPA M It worked. \nFear and frustration burst from Sibeal. \nSIBEAL Jesus Christ! D'er's too much we don't know and if you're won't at least try ta talk some sense into them, I will! \nThe door opens and in comes Connor and Murphy. Sibeal notes the change in appearance. The boys stand at the kitchen table's opposing end, hands in their pockets. Their resolve fills the room. \nThe brothers face off with Poppa M and Sibeal: a bizarre board meeting. Poppa M cocks a brow at Sibeal who clears his throat. \nSIBEAL (CONT'D) Exactly what do you intend to do? \nSilence. Nobody moves. Connor withdraws a hand from his pocket and looks down. He flips a penny on the table. It clatters to a stop. \nMURPHY Every last motherfucker that had anything to do with it. \nEXT. CHURCH -- LATER \nEUNICE Let's go with the venue first. Our perpetrators are devout. They would never commit such an act on sacred ground. And as for the victim? \nDOLLY All their vics were criminals. Clearly not the case here. So, it wasn't them which means this is a local matter and it falls under our jurisdiction. No need for Federal involvement so with all due respect...we'll see you later, Special Agent Bloom. \nEunice stands right in front of Dolly. \nEUNICE Man, I hate it when people say that. \"With all due respect.\" Because it is inevitably followed by a disrespectful remark. I'll give you an example. With all due respect, Detective, this matter falls under whatever jurisdiction I fuckin' say it does. \nDolly fumes.   Duffy and Greenly share an \"oh shit\" look. \nDUFFY Uh, so...let's just...what can you tell us about the shooters? \nEUNICE Shoo-ter. Singular. And I can tell you that he is left handed and how shall I put this delicately...? He's a short bastard. \nDOLLY \n(FACETIOUS) One guy, lefty, short.   Got it. \nEunice furrows her brow. \nEUNICE I'll show you what I'm talking about. \nINT. CHURCH, ALTAR -- MOMENTS LATER \nClose up on Greenly's enraptured face. We pull back and see he is on his knees before Eunice and staring longingly between her legs. \nEUNICE Detective Greenly, you're the victim. \nGREENLY David.   You can call me David. \nEUNICE Very well, David. \nDuffy and Dolly stand behind Greenly, chest to chest, each mimicking guns to the back of the kneeling cop's head. \nEUNICE (CONT'D) The Saints' signature stance. Copley Plaza Hotel four years ago. Two men of identical height put Yuri Petrova on his knees and each dropped iron to the back of his head. \nThis is torture for Greenly and he turns his head from Eunice's crotch. She immediately adjusts him back into place. \nEUNICE (CONT'D) Eyes front, David. The position of the victim and the angles produced by the killers' stance created a unique scenario. The bullets criss crossed in the skull and exited the eye sockets. Here, this did not occur. The rounds moved on a straight trajectory through the back of the victim's head and out the front. Which happens when... \nEunice circles around, positioning herself between Dolly and Duffy. She aims both hands to the back of Greenly's head. \nDUFFY ...one guy's holding two guns to the back of your head. \nEUNICE One guy. \nINT. FLASHBACK, CHURCH -- NIGHT BEFORE \nCrew Cut holds two guns to the back of the pleading priest's head. He fires and McKinney falls. Crew Cut steps forward and we see his face in the light. Piercing, ice blue, sociopathic eyes. WHIP PAN! \nINT. BACK TO PRESENT, CHURCH -- MOMENTS LATER \nEUNICE Now, the victim falls forward.   If you please, David. \nGreenly lays flat on his stomach. \nEUNICE (CONT'D) The killer approached the body from the left side... (Eunice approaches) ...and flipped him to the right. \nDUFFY Left handed. \nEUNICE Yep, southpaw. \nINT. FLASHBACK, CHURCH -- NIGHT BEFORE \nCrew Cut flips the body, showing little respect. He pulls out two pennies and looks at them. He chuckles. WHIP PAN... \nINT. BACK TO PRESENT, CHURCH -- MOMENTS LATER \nDOLLY But you said he was wicked short. \nEUNICE The Saints were later determined to be five foot eleven inches tall. It's just dumb luck that the Russian and McKinney are the exact same height. \nEunice kneels, putting her pointer fingers just below Greenlys eyes. \nEUNICE (CONT'D) The rounds exited Petrova's eye balls. Here they came out the lower cheek. \nShe slides her fingers to Greenly's lower cheeks.    He's putty. \nEUNICE (CONT'D) Three, four inches below the eyes. \nDOLLY That puts him at five, seven-ish. That's not uncommonly short. \nEunice stands and points the a broken down confessional booth door. \nEUNICE The killer posed as a late night confessor. Once the victim entered the booth the killer had him isolated. No escape. Short stuff exits his confessional and kicks in the door of the priest's chamber... \nROMEO Oh...I'd be more inclined to go with something like, \"THAT DOESN'T GO THERE, \nMAN!\" \nThey laugh as they move to the semi-conscious Frenchman. \nLOW ANGLE:    looking up at our trio, Romeo is in the middle. \nROMEO (CONT'D) We saved your entire fucking country in World War Two! Gee...thanks for the statue! \nRomeo's foot smashes to camera, blacking us out. \nINT. VESSEL, BERTH -- NIGHT \nThe boys slumber, side by side in hammocks.     We pull close on them. Silence. They whisper in unison... \nBOTH Quis praesumis profanus apud Dominus? \n(SUBTITLES) Who dares trespass in the house of God? \nTheir eyes pop open. \nINT. BERTH -- LATER \nMurphy rigs a needle to an ink pen. Connor clicks on a hot plate. The boys listen intently to a tiny hand radio nearby. \nRADIO ANNOUNCER V.O. People are still in shock as Father McKinney was a beloved local cleric. \n(MORE) \nRADIO ANNOUNCER V.O. (CONT'D) His selfless contributions to the community too numerous to list. In related news, second generation crime boss, Concezio Yakavetta has not commented on whether he fears for his own safety. \nThe boys flash with recognition. \nBOTH Yakavetta? \nINT. HIGH CLASS HOME, DINING ROOM -- NIGHT \nRich, Italian decor, long table, laden with food. CAPOS 1-6 sit in utter shock, looking to their boss, CONCEZIO YAKAVETTA (37yrs) who heads the table. \nCONCEZIO So, there it is. I want everyone to feel free to share their thoughts. \nHe returns to eating. A moment of silence then the Capos burst into anger. Capo #1 slams a fist down and stands, silencing the lot. \nCAPO #1 I can't believe none of us were consulted on this! The disrespect! We'd have never okay'd such a thing!   A priest! It's an infamita! \nCAPO #2 Yeah! Are we not Catholics, for Christ fucking sakes?! \nCAPO #3 And just for simple revenge?! There's no business in it! You've put us all at risk here! The cops could be all over us! \nCAPO #4 Forget the cops! What about these Saints fuckers?! These guys were long gone! And now you're trying to bring the devil right back to our doorstep?! \nConcezio wipes his mouth, stands and adjusts his cuffs.   He slowly circles the table as he speaks. \nCONCEZIO Six years ago, with the backing of an adoring public, these vigilante fucks put my father on his knees and executed him...in public. Mi Patrigno, a blood relative and benefactor to all of you. Poppa Joe made you rich and his murder remains un-revenged... \nA few roll their eyes at this verbal blunder. \nCONCEZIO (CONT'D) This too, is infamita. These homicidal maniacs nearly wiped this family out. It's taken a lot of time to build ourselves up again, brick by brick. And now that we've re-acquiesced our original power, can we really afford to have these guys pop out of the woodwork someday and try to finish the job when we least expect it? Now, for those of you who have forgotten, let's recap. These fuckers walk into rooms full of gangsters... (denotes surroundings) Outnumbered, outgunned. They kill everyone...and leave. \nSome look as if they are starting to get his point. \nCONCEZIO (CONT'D) You think I don't know that each one of you's been waking up in night sweats over this the last couple years? These sons of bitches prison fucked us with no lube, wiped their dicks on our drapes and walked away! And we been living in silent fear ever since. Oh, we don't talk about it. Rape victims often don't. But it's there. Knowing they're still out there, somewhere. Thinking...what if? \nFear and realization. \nCAPO #4 Concezio is right. Pretending you don't got a problem don't solve nothing. \nHeads nod in shameful agreement. \nCONCEZIO Thank you, Doctor Phil. So, let's take a moment to look at the serendiplious, diperous, serendip... \n(FRUSTRATION) ...type situation we find ourselves in here. There's a good chance they'll show. No catching us with our pants down this time. We can deal with them proactivitously. The cops were embarrassed by these guys too. With a second bite at the apple, they got every reason in the world to crank up the heat. And as for their doting public. I'd imagine they're gonna lose a few fans. \nHeads nod all around.   Sold. \nINT. BERTH -- LATER \nMurphy sits, bare chested on a crate. With the rigged pen, he tattoos his brother's back. Connor cooks something, in a pot, on the hot plate. The resin of anger is evident. \nTATTOOS: Murphy's back has the crucified feet of Christ and Connor's shows Christ's downcast head on the cross. \nCONNOR The prodigal son, huh?   He wants us, he's fuckin' got us. \nMURPHY But why would he do something so public? \nThe boys laugh, snatch the bottle.   Romeo is in shock. \nROMEO That shit was NOT funny, man! \nThe brothers laugh harder. Romeo rolls on his side and slides a hand down the back of his pants. He seems relieved. \nROMEO (CONT'D) Oh, thank you, Jesus. Thought I greased my drawers. \nINT. BERTH -- LATER \nThe boys and Romeo smoke and pass the bottle around. \nCONNOR No. \nROMEO But I got conex all over Bean Town. Romeo'll hook you up like a tow truck! \nMURPHY No. \nROMEO Why not?! \nMURPHY We don't hafta give you reasons. Forget it. \nROMEO It's because I'm Mexican, isn't it! \nCONNOR How dare you, sir, insinuate such a thing? The fact that you're a greasy spic's got nothin' ta do with it. \nThe boys laugh. \nROMEO I'm gonna let you have that one. Look. I can do this. It's not rocket science. You two find bad guys doing bad shit and you kill them, right? \nCONNOR It's not that simple. \nMURPHY Yes it is. \nCONNOR S'pose you're right. I'd sorta hoped we were a little more artistic than that. \nROMEO Well, you ain't. Can't you guys see it? This shit's fate, man. Like preordained type shit. Mea fucking Culpa! Why do you think you just happened to be in that hatchway today? \nMURPHY Oh, don't start gettin' all super fuckin' natural on us. We saw those guys goin' in there! \nROMEO Ah, ha! That's what you say. I say it's because Jeeeeesus wanted it that way! \nCONNOR Oh, no. \nROMEO Fine. Then what exactly do you intend to do when you hit U.S. soil? \nCONNOR We'll go after all Yakavetta's people and operations till we get to the man himself. \nMURPHY Yeah, work our way up the food chain. \nThe brothers seem pleased with themselves. \nROMEO So, what's your first gig?    What's the first thing you gonna do? \nThe boys look to one another.   They're stumped. \nCONNOR Well, I don't suppose we have a succinct plan, y'know, per se. \nMURPHY Yeah. It's not fully developed yet, y'know, as it were. \nA slow smile splits Romeo's face. \nROMEO You two need to chill in the green room, sip on some Pellegrinos and let your manager handle the details. And you better get my Cub Scout badge ready. Cuz if you want to kick Yakavetta in the nuts, let him know you're in town...Romeo's got an ace in the hole for you. \nINT. / EXT. NEWS FOOTAGE, MAN ON THE STREET INTERVIEWS \nHOT DOG VENDOR These guys have gone \"mad dog\" here. They need to be put down. \nCAB DRIVER I think it's disgusting.   I wish they'd have stayed gone. \nPEDESTRIAN I don't believe it for a second!   No bleep-in way the Saints did it! \nINT. BOSTON P.D., WAR ROOM -- MORNING \nThe CHIEF (50's) sits, arms folded. The detectives are present. Eunice stands before a wall adorned with crime scene photos, reports, Concezio and his Capos. \nEUNICE And that's all she wrote. Everything points in the same direction. \nShe taps Yakavetta's picture on the wall. \nCHIEF Why would Yakavetta want them back here? Him of all people. \nDUFFY To have them executed. Revenge. Oldest motive in the book. \nGREENLY The Saints killed his daddy six years ago, right? He was inside when that happened doing a nickel for extortion. \nROMEO Hey! I hail from a colorful people. Besides, you wouldn't know style if it pitched a tent in your ass! (looks into rear view) What do you think of the ride, Conman? \nCONNOR The only way I could be more embarrassed right now is if I was ridin' a moped. \nMURPHY Yeah...while fuckin' a fat girl. \nCONNOR Yeah...rollin' through the gym at my high school reunion. \nROMEO All right!   I get the fucking point! \nINT. WAREHOUSE -- LATER \nCHINESE GANGSTERS #1-#5, shovel mounds of coffee grounds out of crates and pull kilos of white powder. Machinery noise in b.g. \nEXT. WAREHOUSE -- SAME TIME \nCLOSE ON:   Three sets of eyes peaking over oil drums. \nOur trio watches as a DOCK WORKER (22yrs) drives a forklift, unloading the crates from the flatbed and driving them through the huge open bay doors. The boys and Romeo huddle up. \nCONNOR O'kay, here's the plan. \nEXT. \"THE PLAN,\" WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT \nThe \"Queen\" classic, Another One Bites the Dust, presides over this fantasy sequence. The boys, looking more \"quaffed,\" do a pointless slow motion walk toward the forklift, throwing up their collars. \nRomeo, also looking polished, executes a \"Dan Tana\" pistol whipping on the Dock Worker who perfectly out of frame. \nINSIDE WAREHOUSE: The lift pulls to a stop before the gangsters, crate on the forks. Romeo is behind the wheel. \nSLO-MO: Connor and Murphy pop from the crate and fire on their Asian foe, hitting each squarely in the chest. \nSLO-MO: The boys leap down and light cigs as Romeo does the \"one arm action star hang\" off the side of the lift in b.g. WHIP PAN... \nEXT. WAREHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER \nCONNOR We skin out, go ta Doc's for a shot of Irish. We're home in time for tacos. \nMurphy looks unsure.     Connor turns to his brother. \nCONNOR (CONT'D) What? \nMURPHY Well, it's...uh...you know, it's... \nROMEO It's genius. I can even drive an F- lift, man. Got my class \"D\" license and everything. \nCONNOR Now, dat's the spirit. \nROMEO I need a gun. \nCONNOR AND MURPHY Forget it. \nROMEO What the fuck? I'm in on this shit, man! I'm working here! \nThe boys look to each other. Murphy shrugs. Relenting, Connor pulls a metallic object and shoves it in Romeo's hand. \nCONNOR You can consider yourself a fuckin' pledge until we say different. \nRomeo holds up the gun in displeasure, a tiny .22 caliber lady's purse pistol. Murphy snickers. \nROMEO Can I consider myself your girlfriend, too? \nCONNOR That's what you get.   Is there a problem? \nROMEO (beat, fuming) It's fine. \nConnor scopes the warehouse.   Murphy claps Romeo on the shoulder. \nMURPHY Don't worry, Rome.   Shit like this builds character. \nROMEO Yeah, the character of a little bitch. \nMURPHY Now, dat's just unprofessional. \nHe turns and joins his brother as Romeo continues sulking. \nMURPHY (CONT'D) What do we think? \nCONNOR I think Yakavetta murdered a good man just to send us a message. \nMURPHY Well...let's send him one back. \nAs they spirit themselves off.   DISSOLVE TO... \nINT. WAREHOUSE -- LATER \nDoc turns on the lights and they all enter. There is a far more ornate and ancient bar up here: gothic pool table, dusty boxes, cots set up, blankets, towels, hot-plate etc. \nTHE BROTHERS Holy shit. \nDOC The place used ta be an old speak easy in the forties. I only use it for storage, now. \nMurphy is already opening a bottle of Irish. \nROMEO This is so fucking cool. \nDOC Nobody even knows it's up here. You'll be safe. \n(POINTS) You can get in and out the fu-fu-fire escape. \nROMEO You know what this is? This is our hide out, man! We got a hide out! \nCONNOR What are you, fucking five years old? \nMURPHY Hey, Rome, we got sheets and broomsticks. You could build yourself a fort. \nROMEO Fuck the both of you! \nINT. \"HIDE OUT PARTY MONTAGE\" -- NIGHT \nFestive music. A brisket boils on the hot-plate. Romeo and the boys drink and relate the evening's antics to Doc. Dissolve to... \nLater, they all enjoy an impromptu dinner on the pool table. The eating does not slow their banter and laughter. Dissolve to... \nLater, music fades. Silence as Connor and Doc stare each other down across the pool table. Neither flinches. Murphy and Romeo watch with intrigue as Doc stiffles his urge to pop off. \nDOC \n(CONCENTRATION) Not this time, ya little shit. \nCONNOR We'll see, old man. \nA moment passes and Doc is literally shaking. \nCONNOR (CONT'D) Would somebody please come over here and... \nDOC \nFUCK! \nCONNOR ...me up the... \nDOC \nASS! The boys and Romeo burst into hysterics.   Doc rages. \nEXT. / INT. \"BELLA SANTE SALON\" -- MORNING \nEunice enters the swanky salon and moves across the lobby. \nINT. MASSAGE ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER \n\"Gorgeous\" GEORGE (47yrs) is face down as a female masseuse works his back, incense, mood music. Eunice silently slides in flashing her badge, a finger to her pursed lips. \nUneasy, the woman continues her work as Eunice lotions her hands. She covertly replaces the masseuse and motions her out of the room. Eunice digs in as the fatted mobster moans with pleasure. \nGEORGE Oh, yeah.     Someone's been eating their Wheaties.     Yeah, get after it, girl. \nEunice grabs a large massage paddle with rubber fingers. She whips George's towel off, winds up and smacks him on his bare ass, HARD!! \nGEORGE (CONT'D) \nAAAAAH! \nGeorge involuntarily jerks and rolls off the table. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) \nWHAT THE FUCK!? \nHe bolts to his feet. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) You fucking bitch! \nHe rounds the massage table, arms outstretched. Eunice draws her side arm and sticks it in his face, halting him dead. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) Whoa, whoa, whoa. \nEUNICE What did you just call me? \nGEORGE Who are you? \nBack in the Green Machine - an excruciating amount of time passes. Murphy tries to break the ice. \nMURPHY Hey, uh, maybe we should... \nCONNOR Shut up.   Romeo's crying. \nA moment of silence....then all three burst into laughter. \nROMEO You fucking assholes! \nINT. PRUDENTIAL BUILDING, LUXURY APARTMENT -- DAY \nA sprawling high rise apartment, overlooking Boston: buffet table, plasma screen, etc. The Capos are taking advantage of the amenities. Concezio's not here. Capo #5 - #6 fill their plates... \nCAPO #5 That shipment of \"H\" was gonna square our books for six months. Shit. \nCAPO #6 We always bounce back. Besides, look at the bright side. Better the chinks than us, right. \nCAPO #5 I guess.  Like the boss said... (Concezio impression) \"This is war. There's gonna be casuwalities.\" \nThey laugh. Suddenly, George enters with an overnight bag.      The Capos are confused. Feigning a capitol mood... \nGEORGE Oh! Like the Roman Empire in here! Where's all the concubines and shit? \nGeorge laughs. Nobody else does. He looks at the food table.      We pull close on shrimp cocktail and cannoli. A look of dread. \nCAPO #3 George.    What gives, here? \nGEORGE I need to see the Boss, right away. \nCAPO #4 Jimmy the Gofer! \nIn hustles JIMMY THE GOFER (20's), skinny, weak looking. \nCAPO #2 (to Jimmy) Il cortina. \nJimmy draws back a large curtain, exposing a steel panic room. Next to the vault door, is a video screen which displays the unamused face of Concezio. His voice booms over loudspeakers. \nCONCEZIO Get over here! \nGEORGE Whoa! \nGeorge hustles over.   He stands before the screen, confused. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) Uh.   Hey, Boss! I just came by to...! \nCONCEZIO Push the talk button, numb nuts. \nGEORGE Oh. (he does) Can you here me? Over. \nCONCEZIO I can hear you fine, Smokey and the Bandit. Now, what the fuck are you doing here? \nGEORGE Everything's in motion. All our guys are gunning for these Jesus Freaks. I figure, no need for me to be on the streets no more. So, which room do I take, eh? \nCONCEZIO You stupid motherfucker! I told you, you're on the streets till this is over! Now get the fuck outta here! \nA terrified George hustles for the door. \nCONCEZIO (CONT'D) And don't come back here till I tell you to, you fat fucking waste of space! \nGeorge trips over his luggage.   The Capos giggle. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM -- EVENING \nCheap, depressing room. Crew Cut, in his underwear, repairs a broken rosary chain with string and puts it on.He pulls a shoe box from a shopping bag. The brand is \"Hushes.\" Slogan: \"Measure up to your dreams.\" \nHe puts on one shoe. Crew Cut stands before the mirror going up and down on the one shoed foot, noting the height that has been added. The shoe has been cleverly constructed to disguise the higher heel. \nEXT. AUTO BODY -- EVENING \nWe are out back, among scrap cars. George talks with JO JO RHAMA (38yrs). Jo Jo is built like a fire plug and clearly a hoodlum. \nJO JO A priest.   The sick fuck. \nGEORGE And he leaves all of us on the streets holding the bag while him and his are living it up at the Taj fuckin' Majal, not a care in the world. \nJO JO So, until the Saints get popped, we're all lambs to slaughter? \nGEORGE Yeah! And he don't care how many of us they wipe out in the meantime! \nJO JO What do you need me to do, Skipper? \nGEORGE Spread the word to all the brugliones. No bullshit. From your mouth to their ears. \nJO JO Everyone? North and South?   That could get a little dicey. \nMURPHY Look at that. \nWe see Murphy's finger denote a bad \"airbrush\" job. \nMURPHY (CONT'D) That's an arm. \nConnor looks close. \nCONNOR Oh...that's fuckin' harsh. \nThe boys look at one another, then bust out laughing. \nMURPHY Y'er one of a kind, Roc. \nROMEO So, am I as good as this guy, or what? \nCONNOR You, sir, are no David Della Rocco. \nA sound. Instantly, the boys turn and level weapons. There stands ROY (32yrs) thick glasses, geeky. He drops his flowers. \nROY Whoa!  Whoa! Whoa! Holy shit! (beat, recognition) HOLY SHIT! You're the Saints! I'm Roy, it's an honor. Huge fan! \nThe boys reholster and look to one another.    Disapproval. \nCONNOR We're developin' quite the cult following in the old neighborhood. \nThe boys continue to chat with Roy as Romeo answers his cell. \nROMEO Que pasa. \nIt's Cesar. \nCESAR I got that info you wanted, mijo. \nINT. TANNING SALON -- NIGHT \nThe Salon Manager approaches the back door with keys in hand. \nCESAR V.O. The place is Tropical Tan on Bunker Hill. It's where the fat fucking juedo gets his fake bake at. He's got a secret appointment. Once a week, never misses. Eight o'clock, tonight. \nThe Manager lets George slip in. He steels into a tanning room.A Mexican towel boy has spied George. He picks up a phone... \nINT. MAUSOLEUM -- MOMENTS LATER \nRomeo snaps his phone shut and turns to the boys. \nROMEO We got him. \nROY (re: Romeo) Who's this, your new sidekick? (extends hand) Pleased to meet you. I'm Roy. \nROMEO How would you like me to sidekick you in the ass, Roy? \nCONNOR \n(GIGGLING) Let's go. \nThe three walk for the door, leaving Roy behind. \nROY I, I didn't mean to... \nROMEO I'm sick of this shit! I've been breaking my balls, here and I get second banana billing! I... \nMURPHY I, I, I. There is no \"I\" in team, ya selfish prick. \nROMEO Yeah?!   Well, there's an \"I\" in \"Fuck you! \nEXT. GRAVEYARD -- MOMENTS LATER \nMoody music as our trio walks through the gravestones. \nINT. \"TROPICAL TAN,\" TANNING ROOM -- NIGHT \nThe brothers and Romeo sneak up to the tanning bed. George sings a Sinatra tune as his fat stomach props the cover up like a half open clamshell. Suddenly, Murphy leaps up and sits on the cover. George is being crushed beneath his weight. Connor kneels. \nCONNOR Lovely voice. We'd like ya ta sing for us. What do ya say? George struggles and nods. Murphy hops off. George spills out, hot pink Speedos. On all fours and breathing heavy... \nGEORGE It's getting hard to be a fucking gentleman of leisure, here! \nThe boys pull weapons and throw him against the wall in a Jesus Christ pose, pinning his hands with their guns. \nMURPHY We want the shooter you motherfuckers used on that priest. \nGEORGE I don't know who it is. \nThe boys cock back the hammers on their weapons. \nEveryone calms. S.S. Bruglione #3 gives a respectful nod to the Northside guys but sits with his own. \nINT. EL CAVA, KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER \nWe do not see George just below frame as the boys are \"working on him\" in some way, putting on finishing touches. Romeo barrels in. \nROMEO These dagos are getting antsy and I'm getting Spicaroo'd and Pepe'd. The kid's about to go Poncho fucking Villa out there! \nCONNOR Stick it out. Waitin' on one more. \nEXT. PARKING LOT -- MOMENTS LATER \nJo Jo exits his Cadillac and walks toward El Cava.   There is a \"closed for private function\" sign on the door. \nINT. JACKED UP SUV, NEARBY -- SAME TIME \nCrew Cut watches Jo Jo.   He dials his cell. \nINT. GREENHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER \nFrom behind we see the Old Man gardening.    He answers a ringing phone, nearby. We do not see his face. \nINT. SUV -- MOMENTS LATER \nThe following conversation is in Italian. \nCREW CUT He is not with them. \nOLD MAN Are you certain? \nCREW CUT Yes. It is only the sons. They have a Spaniard with them. They will slaughter everyone. \nOLD MAN Let them. If you kill the sons...the father will come. \nCrew Cut develops a sinister smile. \nINT. EL CAVA, KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER \nConnor watches Jo Jo greet the others.    He turns to Romeo who is angrily cooking up a storm. \nCONNOR The gang's all here. \nWithout missing a beat, Romeo slams the hot pans into a dish sink. He stands fuming with his hands on his hips. \nROMEO Gimme my fucking bee bee gun. \nMURPHY Naw.   You've earned your stripes, Rome. \nMurphy throws him a .9 mm.   Romeo smiles. \nINT. BAR -- MOMENTS LATER \nJO JO So....where's Gorgeous? \nSuddenly, George comes rolling out of the kitchen, unconscious and tied, face down, to a bus cart. There is writing on his back. Everyone pulls their weapons and moves toward. \nN.S. BRUGLIONE #2 What the fuck is going on, here? \nS.S. BRUGLIONE #2 Where's that spic barkeep? Yo, Pepe! Where you at?! \nAs the gangsters achieve the cart, the brothers creep over the bar in the b.g. Brugliones look down on George, painted on his back... \nS.S. BRUGLIONE #3 \"Erin go brah?\" What the hell does that mean? Connor and Murphy are standing 25 feet behind them. \nMURPHY It's Irish for \"You're fucked.\" \nHard core music as the Brugliones turn in horror. Everyone begins firing and we have slow motion gunplay to pulsating music. \nSeveral are chewed up as chests explode and they are blown into George on the cart, knocking it over. George comes to. \nRomeo appears and tears in, sending several more crashing into the salad bar. \nMurphy, while firing, dives back over the bar as bottles explode. Connor rapid fires as he dives into a booth. \nThe boys rise and lay out a second barrage, blasting the rest into buffet tables and a soda fountain. The music cuts. \nROMEO Viva La Mejico, bitches! \nGeorge bolts up.    The bus cart is still tied to his fat belly. \nGEORGE Uh, I've seen the light! You guys have really turned me around on this! I'm like born again and shit! I swear! \nMURPHY (to Connor) What do ya think? Let him go? \nConnor slips one bullet in a revolver, spins the barrel and snaps it shut. He points it to George's forehead. George weeps in earnest. \nEunice denotes the bodies. \nEUNICE This...simply won't do. We made a deal. The big fish step in if your body count gets too high and... (re: carnage) ...you have been very naughty boys. \nRockin' music overtakes as we DISSOLVE TO... \nINT. EL CAVA -- LATER \nWith Eunice directing them, the boys and Romeo restage the crime scene. With a squeegee they move pools of blood across the linoleum floor and re-position bodies. \nThe boys wrap Jo Jo's body in a tarp and put it in the Green Machine. Romeo creates blood splatter with a turkey baster. \nRomeo and the brothers place the guns they used in the hands of dead gangsters as Eunice drops bullet casings in carefully chosen spots. \nRomeo and the brothers leave with the utensils used to rig the scene. The music fades, leaving Eunice in the center of... \nINT. EL CAVA -- LATER \nSilence. She removes her ear plugs and the sound returns. We are on a very different looking scene. CSI, forensics, even Dolly and Duffy wait with baited breath. Greenly is not present. \nEUNICE O'kay.   Here's how it all went down. \nDolly and Duffy open their notepads. \nINT. FLASHBACK, EL CAVA -- NEVER \nNorthside stands facing off with the Southside. All brugliones are frozen in place. Eunice saunters down the middle. Cool music... \nEUNICE A secret gathering of the Brugliones. The topic of discussion? Weak leadership and betrayal. \nN.S. BRUGLIONE #1 Yakavetta's hiding from these Jesus Freaks and making us look like pussies. \nS.S. BRUGLIONE #1 And he's hanging all of us out to dry to boot. \nA pause as they size each other up. \nN.S. BRUGLIONE #2 All right.   I'll be the first to say it. \nEUNICE The enemy of my enemy is my friend. So, even with all their old vendettas... \nN.S. BRUGLIONE #2 ...I say fuck the Yakavettas. \nEUNICE And there it is. Guess what comes next. \nEunice points to men as he moves down the line. \nEUNICE (CONT'D) Red Rover.   Red Rover. \nS.S. BRUGLIONE #2 We're taking over. \nEUNICE Ah. Easier uttered than accomplished. The North End and the South End may as well be the Hetfields and the McCoys. These fellas...they just don't get on. \nAll the Brugliones yell over one another. \nN.S. BRUGLIONE #3 Fuck you! The North End built that racket from the ground up! \nS.S. BRUGLIONE #3 South End's been carrying your fucking asses for years! \nN.S. BRUGLIONE #3 15 percent?! In your dreams, asshole! \nS.S. BRUGLIONE #3 Whoa! Just went up to twenty, fuck stick! \nS.S. Brulione #1 flashes a gun in his waist band. \nS.S. BRUGLIONE #1 You want some of this, you mutt?! \nN.S. Bruglione #1 pulls his weapon. \nN.S. BRUGLIONE #1 Let's see what you got! \nThey all pull and level at one another. They freeze in place and all yelling ceases as Eunice walks down the middle. \nEUNICE Oh, the cliche. A Mexican stand off in a Mexican restaurant. \nEunice looks deeply at all the men as she turns a slow circle. \nEUNICE (CONT'D) They cut each other to pieces...and nobody walked away. Who knows who fired first. Could have been any one of them. But somebody let it loose. (pointing to men) And duck, duck, duck... \nEunice stands before S.S. Brulione #2. \nEUNICE (CONT'D) Goose. \nBOOM! They all start shooting as Eunice stands in the crossfire unaffected. Men fall dead and we see the relevance of each thing Eunice did to doctor the scene. WHIP PAN... \nINT. BACK TO PRESENT, EL CAVA -- LATER \nShe hands the INTERpol file to the brothers. \nCONNOR This is the guy? \nEUNICE That's the guy. He's a Sicilian immigrant, name of Ottilio Panza. \nMURPHY Five, five?    He's short bastard isn't he? \nEUNICE Yes...and well put. He'll be front page news in the morning but we have to assume Yakavetta already knows we've ID'd his guy. We can't give him time to 'Plan B' us. \nMURPHY We're hittin' him tomorrow night.   Dat soon enough? \nEveryone else cuts their conversation and listens. \nEUNICE Should be.   Where's it gonna happen? \nCONNOR The Pru. \nDOLLY The Prudential Building?   What are you, cracked? \nGREENLY Why don't you just do it on center ice at a fucking Bruin's game?! \nCONNOR Dat's where the man is so dat's where we're goin'. No guts no glory, Green Beans. \nMURPHY In fact, we could use a few extra hands...that is if you fellas can still get yer Irish on. \nGREENLY Hey, I got balls for days, pally.   I'm a fucking sack-o-matic. \nThey all chuckle. \nDOLLY AND DUFFY We're in. \nEUNICE (to all) Well, you boys have fun. Connor, Murphy? Escort a lady to the door? \nThey each offer an arm and move her toward the door. \nCONNOR Y'sure you don't wanna hear the plan? I'm not tryin' ta brag or nothin' but this one's a real Picasso. \nMURPHY Aw, Jesus. \nCONNOR Hey. \nEUNICE School night. Got some homework to do. Besides, I'd like to critique your masterpiece with a fresh eye. \nShe stops at the door and turns.    Her face shows concern. \nMURPHY What is it? \nEUNICE Something ain't right with this whole thing. Panza knew you were in there tonight and he just let it happen. Didn't lift a finger. I mean, if he's working for Yakavetta, why would he stand by and just watch all his guys get taken out? \nMURPHY That is...interestin'. \nCONNOR You think maybe we got another fox in the hen house here? \nEUNICE Starting ta look that way. Somebody pushed that visa through. Could have ourselves a gen-u-ine 'Ghost in the Darkness,' here. \nINT. GREENHOUSE -- LATER \nCrew Cut lies on the shop table. He's lost a lot of blood and is in shock. Using gardening utensils, the Old Man removes the bullet. We see his face for the first time. Unremarkable. In Italian... \nCREW CUT They still live...What if he does not come? What if... \nOLD MAN Shhhhh.   He will come. \nINT. BASEMENT -- NIGHT \nThe Irish GUN DEALER (30's) from the first film leads the brothers and Romeo through a basement to a large, steel vault door. \nGUN DEALER Expanded my operation, since I saw ya last. Word got out who may or may not have outfitted ya. Turns out ya got quite the underground followin'. \nHe swings the vault open. Romeo and the boys stand in angelic light at the gates of Heaven. Cheesy music as they enter... \nINT. VAULT -- CONTINUOUS \nExpanded indeed. Gleaming weapons everywhere. Sheer awe. Something catches Romeo's eye and he moves off. To boys... \nGUN DEALER Please, gentlemen. Preferred customers select from my private reserve. \nHe withdraws two Mahogany boxes. \nGUN DEALER (CONT'D) If I may make a suggestion. \nHe lifts the lids. In each box is a pair of Desert Eagle .50 cal \"Black Outs\". The triangular barrels have been fitted with matching triangular silencers. The boys are mystified. \nMURPHY I feel like that kid who found the gold ticket in the candy bar in \"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.\" \nEXT. THE PRUDENTIAL BUILDING -- NIGHT \nDolly drives a laundry truck into the Pru's loading dock area. \nINT. LAUNDRY TRUCK -- NIGHT \nDolly backs it up to the dock and pulls to a stop.   He turns. \nDOLLY God speed. Romeo, in a laundry uniform, emerges from the back pushing a loaded laundry cart. He enters a... \nINT. UTILITY HALL -- MOMENTS LATER \nAt the hall's opposing end, two maintenance workers move toward. Romeo sees and quickly puts his head down. Soon, Romeo and the maintenance men converge. They turn, entering opposing elevators. \nINT. ROMEO'S ELEVATOR -- CONTINUOUS \nAs the doors close, Romeo looks into the opposing elevator. The maintenance men are Duffy and Greenly, ball caps, duffel bags. \nAs the elevator ascends, Romeo swipes off the laundry, pulls the false top. The brothers pop out in their usual garb. Weapons emerge and they gear up. Romeo looks unsure... \nMURPHY What. \nROMEO Nothing. \nCONNOR Out with it! What the hell's the matter with ya? \nROMEO Nothing! It's just...this is some heavy shit. \nCONNOR Ya did fine at your uncle's place. \nROMEO Yeah, but we're going off a new script here. I'm just having a...period of adjustment. \nMURPHY You're about to have a period of gettin' yer ass beat! \nROMEO Hey! You two ain't the only ones rollin' with no health insurance! Just let me do my thing. I'm absorbing this. \nCONNOR This is not the time for you to be absorbin' shit! Now, if ya freeze up when you get in there just point yer gay guns at 'em and fer Christ sakes, at least try ta look cool! \nMURPHY I thought you were all hot fer dis! \nROMEO Oh, I'm hot! I'm fucking red hot! The kid's flamin' like Matt Damon in the Grande Camens! \nDing!   Romeo has a look of dread. \nCONNOR This is you. Be on time. \nRomeo firms himself up as the door opens. \nROMEO I'll be there. \nRomeo exits with the cart. The boys remain.    The doors close. Connor and Murphy look at each other. \nCONNOR You ready fer dis shit, my dear brother? \nMURPHY (cocking .50 cal) Let's do some gratuitous violence. \nFLASH TO WHITE... \nINT. LUXURY APARTMENT -- NIGHT \nA demolished environment. The towering windows are blown out, providing a threatening view of the city below. Here, Eunice stands, looking out over the panorama. \nEUNICE (to herself) On a sultry Saturday in September the Saints saved seventeen souls...try saying that five times fast. \nShe turns and walks the marble floor which is like a runway, lined with pulverized statues. A long table of ravaged food extends. Crime scene personnel toil. Ritualized bodies everywhere.   Greenly is by the panic room. He pushes the \"talk\" button. \nGREENLY Come on. There's nothing to be afraid of. It's all over. \n(TURNS) He won't come out. \nHe joins Dolly and Duffy who stand on the periphery. Eunice is dead center, absorbing the scene when suddenly, FBI Agent JOHN KUNTSLER barrels in with his G-MEN #1 - #3. \nKUNTSLER Special Agent Bloom! You are hereby relieved of all obligation to this investigation. \nHe holds up his I.D.   A collective groan from crime scene personnel. \nKUNTSLER (CONT'D) That's right, kids. This crime scene is now under the full jurisdiction of your beloved federal government. As of now, you will all report to me, Special Agent John Kuntsler. \nThe detectives look to Kuntsler's G-men as if squaring off. \nKUNTSLER (CONT'D) Don't let us interrupt you. Just don't forget to turn over everything you find. We have people standing by ready to take credit for all your hard work. \nHe chuckles as all return to work.   Kuntsler turns to Eunice. \nKUNTSLER (CONT'D) So, how ya doin', Bloomy? \nDuffy, Greenly and the boys descend the tower. Greenly works the controls as Duffy helps the boys tie on harnesses. \nMURPHY It's ridiculous! Probably based on some stupid shit ya saw in a movie! And here I am AGAIN all tyin' myself up with rope! What is the deal with you and rope?! Honestly! \nCONNOR It happens ta be a useful thing! \nThe boys start yelling over each other.   Duffy turns to Connor. \nDUFFY You didn't get this from a movie...did you? \nMurphy regards his brother, \"well?\"   Pause. \nCONNOR The \"Eiger Sanction,\" Clint Eastwood! And it worked like a fucking charm for him! \nINT. JANITOR CLOSET -- SAME TIME \nRomeo peeks out a cracked door at a Mafioso guard. LLOYD (33yrs), a janitor, gagged and duct taped to a hand truck. He has a shiner. Romeo looks through his wallet. \nROMEO O'kay Lloyd Cranston of 135 Liberty Lane, apartment 3C. (shows him wallet pic) Lovely wife and kids. How old are they? Nevermind. Here's the situation, Lloyd. Me and a couple of friends of mine are fittin' to do some killin' here tonight. I'm talking bullets and blood, custom-wholesale slaughter. You following me, Lloyd-O? (Lloyd nods) Good. Now, I've run into a little snag. I need to figure out a tag line. You know, something cool to say when it's all over like...\"I'll be back,\" but mine, y'know? I need to own this one. I think this'll help me get through the quote, unquote event. I'm going to take your gag off and you and me are going to riff a little, o'kay? Let's have fun with this. \nLloyd nods and Romeo rips off his gag. \nLLOYD I can't believe you! I'm a fucking janitor. What do I know about bullets and slaughter and shit? \nROMEO Not riffing, Lloyd! Now, I need an \"Hasta La Vista\" line, toute fucking suite and you're gonna help me think of one! \nEXT. SCAFFOLD -- LATER \nEunice stands alone on the end of the scaffold. \nEUNICE And you can count on it like the U.S. mail. Through rain, sleet, hail or snow...something always seems to go wrong for these poor sons o' guns. \nThe scaffold suddenly stops. \nCONNOR What the fuck? \nGREENLY (hitting controls) I don't know! It just stopped! \nMURPHY Well, get it fuckin' goin' again! \nGREENLY It won't turn back on!     It just died! \nBROTHERS \nOH, SHIT! \nThe boys look over the edge.     Long way down. \nCONNOR How much time?! \nDUFFY (looks at watch) Sixty Seconds! \nMURPHY We gotta go now! \nDUFFY What are you talking about!? \nCONNOR If we're even a few seconds late, Romeo's dead! We gotta go! (looking up) We're down thirteen stories! \nMURPHY Eleven more to go!     Ball park it! \nThey start counting out lengths of rope by feeding them through their hands and extending their arms out to the sides. \nBROTHERS One floor, two, three... \nMURPHY \n(MIFFED) The fuckin' Eiger Sanction. \nINT. JANITOR CLOSET -- SAME TIME \nLloyd struggles to think. \nLLOYD Uh...\"Take that, suckers!\" \nROMEO Not cool enough. \nLLOYD Uh, \"Merry Christmas, mother fuckers!\" \nROMEO Too sacrilegious. \nLLOYD Oh God, uh, how about \"Eat it!\" \nROMEO What are we at, a buffet, now? \nLLOYD Good God, man! I'm a... \nSLO-MO: Gangsters are torn up as they are blown over furniture, into walls. Romeo blasts. Slow motion gun battle. \nSLO-MO: Yakavetta runs toward his panic room. At the last second, Jimmy the Gofer hip-checks him and dives in. The door slides shut. \nFor a few moments the gun battle rages around Eunice who stands in the center rapid firing at the gangsters. \nEUNICE \nYEEEEEEE HAAAAAAAW!!! \nSoon it is over. The brothers slam Concezio to his knees and level to the back of his head. As he begs for his life... \nBOTH And shepherds we shall be, for Thee, my Lord, for Thee. Power hath descended forth from Thy hand, that our feet may swiftly carry out Thy command. \n(MORE) \nBOTH (CONT'D) So, we shall flow a river forth to Thee and teeming with souls shall it ever be. \nRomeo watches in awe. \nBOTH (CONT'D) In Nomine Patris, e Filii, e Spiritus Sancti. \nBoom.   Concezio drops.   Romeo's been waiting, guns up and... \nROMEO \"Who ordered the whup ass fajita!?\" \nMURPHY What? \nCONNOR Whup ass fajita? \nThe brothers turn to each other. \nCONNOR AND MURPHY That's fuckin' stupid. \nEunice whistles in sympathy as she lifts her brim with a Colt. \nEUNICE Hold up, now. \nEverything freezes in place.     Eunice shuffles over to Romeo. \nEUNICE (CONT'D) Was that the best you could do? \nROMEO It's just...I couldn't think...I \nEUNICE Shhhhhh. (whispers in ear) Ya broke down the door, didn'tcha? \nRomeo snaps his head toward the entry with inspiration in his eyes. QUICK CUT: He breaks down the door. QUICK CUT: The brothers shoot Yakavetta. QUICK CUT: Romeo, guns up and once more with feeling... \nROMEO Ding dong, motherfucker, diiiing dong! \nThe brothers look at Romeo, then to each other. \nMURPHY Exactly. \nCONNOR You said it. \nWHIP PAN... \nINT. BACK TO PRESENT, LUXURY APARTMENT -- LATER \nEunice stands before the panic room door.   She is totally disheveled. She swipes her hair back. \nEUNICE And that, gentlemen...is the sound of the fat lady singin'. \nEveryone stands in shock, Kuntsler, his G-men, the detectives even crime scene workers. Greenly whispers to Duffy... \nGREENLY Should we...clap or something? \nDUFFY Shut up. \nSuddenly, the panic room door slides open and Jimmy yanks Eunice inside. The door shuts. Everyone rushes toward. \nKUNTSLER Hey! \nDuffy bangs on the door. \nDUFFY Eunice!    Oh, shit!    Eunice! Greenly slams the talk button. \nGREENLY If you hurt her, you piece of shit, I will kill you! Do you fucking hear, me? I'll kill you! \nGreenly wheels around, facing Kuntsler. \nGREENLY (CONT'D) Get a hostage negotiator down here and put some stank on it! He could be in there all...touching her and shit! \nINT. PANIC ROOM -- CONTINUOUS \nCONNOR One in the hole. \nThey see a shotgun behind the bar. Murphy grabs it.   Just as they are about to stand, they hear Doc cry out. \nDOC Boys! \nThey stand and level. Crew Cut has Doc from behind, .9mm to his temple. Thick accent... \nCREW CUT Put dem down! Throw dem over! \nThe boys do not flinch. Crew Cut pushes his gun into Doc's temple hard. He cries out in pain. \nCREW CUT (CONT'D) Throw dem over! \nThe boys toss their guns over the bar. Crew Cut levels toward them, holding Doc in place. He whispers in Doc's ear. \nCREW CUT (CONT'D) Brothers, eh? Which one first?      This one? (re: Murphy) Dee other, eh? \nHe cocks back his hammer. A silence POP! rings out from the shadows. Crew Cut's hand is hit. He drops, crying out in pain. \nSLO-MO: Poppa M emerges from the shadows and moves to Crew Cut with a smoking, silenced Walther pistol in hand. \nThe brothers have just a moment of shock before Greenly chokes up some blood. They jump the bar and rush to him. \nMURPHY Jesus Christ! \nCONNOR Doc!   Call da fuckin' ambulance! As they hold Greenly and beg him to hold on, we move to Poppa M standing over Crew Cut. Crew Cut looks up at him in awe. \nCREW CUT You. \nPOPPA M Where is the Old Man? \nCREW CUT Never. \nPoppa M pulls two .38 revolvers. He snaps the rotary chambers out, puts one bullet in each gun, spins the chambers and snaps them shut. He holds them out to Crew Cut. The boys weep, oblivious to this. \nMURPHY Just hold on. \nCONNOR Hang in there, brother.     They're comin'. \nGreenly struggles to speak. \nGREENLY Naw, boys...it's over. Don't worry...proudest day of my life. \nHe seizes violently and dies. The brothers are in anguish. Crew Cut picks a .38 and stands. He and Poppa M level to each other's foreheads. Crew Cut is excited. Poppa M is calm, tranquil. The brothers bolt up in shock. \nBROTHERS Da! \nPOPPA M Easy, boys. \nThe boys watch in horror, trying to figure it out. Poppa M motions for his opponent to go first. Crew Cut cocks his hammer back with a \"click.\" The brother's eyes go wide. \nMURPHY What the fuck's he doin'? \nCrew Cut pulls the trigger, \"click!\" \nBROTHERS \nJESUS CHRIST! Connor rushes over and grabs up the shotgun. \nCONNOR I'm gonna blow this mother fucker's brains out, right now! \nHe cocks it and levels to Crew Cut's head. \nPOPPA M \nCONNOR! \nConnor stops.   Poppa M holds out his free hand.   Halt. \nPOPPA M (CONT'D) Son...Daddy's workin'. \nConnor lowers the gun.    Poppa M pulls back the hammer, \"click.\" \nPOPPA M (CONT'D) Where is he? \nCrew Cut is unsure of himself. He thinks. Shakes his head.       The brothers focus on Poppa M's gun as he tenses on the trigger. \nCONNOR AND MURPHY \n(WHISPER) Come on. \nCrew Cut clenches up, bracing for impact. Poppa M pulls, \"click.\" The brothers drop to their knees and pray hard. Crew Cut recovers. He smiles, pulls back the hammer. In Italian... \nCREW CUT Make me famous. \nMAFIOSO #1 What's da matter with you, eh? \nWe see Louie peeking through the curtains. \nLOUIE \n(WHISPERING) Easy, Noah...easy friend. \nMAFIOSO #2 What are you, stupid or something? \nHe smacks Noah across the face. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. WOODS -- NIGHT \nNoah and Louie bury the bodies of Mafioso #1 and #2.      Louie stops and rests. He watches Noah and thinks. \nINT. COBBLER SHOP -- DAY \n\"CLOSED\" sign in the door.   Noah and Louie eat sandwiches. \nPOPPA M Then one day... \nLOUIE Why should we not help others who suffer these Mafia thugs? \nNoah puts down his sandwich. Louie talks to Noah with passion, m.o.s. and he listens while nodding his head. \nPOPPA M V.O. Then it began. \nOver dialogue and music we see the following images... \nNoah cuts out a chalk sketch on a large sheet of shoe leather. \nLouie helps Noah make a \"serious looking\" leather vest. \nLouie hobbles in with a sack.   He dumps a bevy of handguns on a table. All different makes. \nPOPPA M V.O. (CONT'D) Louie would pick the marks and plan everything in detail. \nLouie draws a map on a note pad and speaks m.o.s. \nHolsters and bullet belts are sewn into the vest. \nNoah loads the vest with guns as Louie tightens the buckles, stands back and looks Noah over. Ominous. \nPOPPA M V.O. (CONT'D) And I would go in and do the jobs. \nA mob boss and two body guards wait for an elevator. The doors open. Insides is Noah, dark jacket, English Mac (hat). He opens his coat, revealing the vest. He draws two weapons, executes them all and calmly hits a button. The doors close. \nPOPPA M V.O. (CONT'D) I would execute, over and over again, those who had taken my father from me. \nWe do a montage of Noah killing Mafiosi in many different ways. \nPOPPA M V.O. (CONT'D) So it went for years. \nEXT. BACK TO PRESENT, KITCHEN -- LATER \nWe pan to the gaping mouthed brothers. \nMURPHY Jesus. \nCONNOR So...how'd ya end up inside, Da? \nPOPPA M Back in '75, I did a hit, came out and the police were waitin' for me.

Connor looks up. \n", "test1_input": "CONNOR Go fuck y'rself. \nThey pull wrapped white kilos.    Connor dips in a finger and tastes. \nCONNOR (CONT'D) It's heroin. \nMURPHY How the fuck would you know? \nCONNOR Fuck you.    I know shit. \nINT. WAREHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER \nRomeo's winging it, jerky moves, grinding gears as the forklift staggers across the mammoth warehouse toward the gangsters at the opposing end. The crate blocks Romeo from view. He's driving blind as the rickety crate jiggles on the forks. \nINSIDE CRATE:   Connor and Murphy are sardined, back to back. \nMURPHY Jesus!    What the fuck's he doin'?! \nCONNOR He can't see where he's goin'! \nMurphy peaks through a crack. \nMURPHY Shit!    Tell him to go left, now! \nConnor puts his mouth to a knot hole. \nCONNOR Go left!    Go left! \nROMEO What?! \nConnor sticks his finger out the hole and points. Romeo wrenches the wheel and they narrowly avoid machinery. The crate rocks... \nMURPHY I can't fuckin' believe I let you talk me into this! This is a stupid plan! \nCONNOR I didn't notice you throwin' out any ideas, ya creative asshole! \nMURPHY Fuck you! \nThe boys start elbowing each other in a close quarters scrap while hurling obscenities. \nROMEO Hey!   What's goin' on in there?! \nINSIDE CRATE: Murphy suddenly stops, eyes wide as he looks through the crack. They are headed for a \"Mechanic's Well.\"   A long, rectangular cement hole in the floor six feet deep. \nMURPHY Jesus Christ! Tell him to stop! \nConnor slams his mouth to the knot hole. \nCONNOR \nBRAKES!   BRAKES! BRAKES! \nA few of the Chinese turn as Romeo slams on the brakes, screeching to a halt just before the well. The crate slides right off and falls in, disappears from sight. CRASH! \nA large cloud of coffee dust plumes.   A wide eyed Romeo is exposed. The Asian gangsters stare in shock. \nHard techno music! Suddenly, Romeo whips it in reverse, cranks the wheel guns it and navigates the well. Speeds toward the gangsters. \nMECHANIC'S WELL: (SLO-MO) The brothers burst from the debris, covered in coffee grounds and white powder. They draw their weapons and walk toward the ramp at the well's opposing end. \nThe Chinese pull and start firing. Romeo dives off and rolls behind some machines. The lift continues on target. \nThe brothers emerge and tear right in, firing at the gangsters. Romeo fires his useless 22. In the ensuing fire fight the brothers kill all but Chinese Gangster #3. \nThe forklift crashes through the table with the stacked heroin. \nSLO-MO: The brothers slam the final Gangster to his knees and level to the back of his head and recite the following in synchronicity... \nBROTHERS And shepherds we shall be, for Thee, my Lord, for Thee. Power hath descended forth from Thy hand, that our feet may swiftly carry out Thy command. So, we shall flow a river forth to Thee and teeming with souls shall it ever be. \n(MORE) \nBROTHERS (CONT'D) In Nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti. \nPOP!   POP!    They kill him.   DIP TO BLACK... \nINT. WAREHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER \nHaunting music. Black and White film as Connor and Murphy take great care in ritualizing the bodies. They place pennies in eyes and cross hands over chests. WHIP PAN... \nEXT. BACK TO PRESENT, WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT \nBodies are wheeled out in the b.g. as Dolly and Greenly talk privately with Eunice. \nDOLLY Just got a call from my best snitch. Never steered me wrong. He says its this guy. (hands Eunice mug) \"Gorgeous\" George Tuffano. He's trusted bruglione to Yakavetta but not blood. He's been left control of the streets. He's running all of it. \n", "test1_true": "GREENLY They call him \"Gorgeous\" cuz he likes his silk suits and jewelry. He's even got the 'out of season' fake bake going on, a real peacock, this guy. \nEUNICE Yeah, I heard of this rodeo clown. Duffy approaches, hands Eunice a tiny bullet in a baggy. \nDUFFY Ballistics just dug it out. \nThey all look perplexed. \nEUNICE A twenty two? You gotta be kidding me. That's like bringing a knife to a gunfight. \nGREENLY Yeah, or like bringing a really small gun...to a gunfight. \nThey all blank stare Greenly for a moment.        Moving on. \nDUFFY I don't know. Ballistics is reading three shooters. This is one of them. \nEUNICE Well, I'm having a hard time believing that one of the three most lethal individuals on the planet just switched over to bird shot. \nDOLLY Maybe we're reading it wrong. The priest was a frame job, right? \nDUFFY Yeah, maybe somebody's trying to eliminate some competition here. \nEunice considers this.   The Detectives seem hopeful. \nEUNICE No, sir. It's them. But we just might have ourselves a change in the line up, here. \nThe detectives all look at one another nervously. \nGREENLY Fine, they're back.   What's the plan? \nEUNICE Hell, we've just been called up to the big show. We are tracking multiple perpetrators, gentlemen. The plan? We keep our ear to the ground and try to figure out where Yakavetta's hiding. Napoleon. We find him and flip him. And as for the Saints...I'm gonna have me a face to face with these boys one way or the other. \nShe walks off.   The cops look terrified. \nDOLLY Holy...fucking...shit. \nINT. GREENHOUSE -- NIGHT \nWe see the hands of an OLD MAN (70) as he mists flowers in this lush environment. He ambles to a shop table, wearing a metal leg brace, circa 1950's and a corrective shoe, Polio. We do not see his face. \nCLOSE ON: small black and white TV on table.     Breaking news.    Live from the crime scene... \nREPORTER #3 Law enforcement has confirmed the Saints are back! \nThis gives way to... \nINT. / EXT. NEWS FOOTAGE \nThe Saints pencil composites are shown.

ALLEY -- LATER \nCLOSE ON:   A metal door opens revealing DOC (60's). \nDOC \nBOYS! \nThe brothers and Doc hug and greet as he ushers them in with Romeo in tow. The bar is closed, empty. \nDOC (CONT'D) Jesus, Mary and Joseph! I saw da nuh, nuh, news channel. Are ya boys all right?! \nCONNOR Sound as an Irish pound, Doc. \nMURPHY Is it too late for a shot? \nDOC Oh, the Lord told me you'd be comin! He said, \"Doc, they're comin\" and I was ta get everting ready. So I did. Everting's ruh, ruh, ruh, it's all set. \nROMEO Uh, hem! \nMURPHY Oh, this is our Mexican. \nDOC (shaking hands) How are ya, lad?

Eyes wide. \nMURPHY Maybe we should. \nCONNOR You're sure, Roc? You know this? \nRocco smiles. \nROCCO No...I   just have faith. And for a second   there, you almost did too. Y'see,   it's contagious. And if enough people   catch it...look out, baby. \nA roaring cheer arises, shaking the very foundations of the arena. The boys turn in awe. The stands are still empty. \nINT. LIVING ROOM -- LATER \nThey jolt awake and look to each other. \nCONNOR While the wicked stand confounded... \nMURPHY ...call me with Thy Saints surrounded. \nEXT. BOSTON COMMONS, JOGGING TUNNEL -- MORNING \nPoppa M stands before Eunice.   She hands him an envelope. \nEUNICE He lives in York Maine. About 30 minutes from here. Better go quick. I logged on to an FBI database to get the info. Homeland Security does internal monitoring now. Only a matter of time before they flag it. \nPOPPA M Will they know it's you? (she nods) Will you be all right, dear? \nEUNICE I hear Costa Rica's nice. \nShe looks at him as her eyes well up with tears. \nEUNICE (CONT'D) I never thought I'd ask this of another human being but please...kill this man. \nShe is overcome and weeps.   Poppa M holds her. \nPOPPA M It ends taday. \nINT. FBI HEAD QUARTERS, BOSTON BRANCH, KITCHENETTE -- LATER \nKuntsler pours a coffee. G-man #2 comes in holding a piece of paper. \nKUNTSLER Anybody word from Bloom, yet? \nG-MAN #2 Nothing. \nKUNTSLER I want that little Bayou Bitch in here. Something stinks about this whole thing. \nG-MAN #2 I'm having D.H.S. dump her IP and check for flags. See if she's been poking around. \nINT. TRINITY CHURCH -- LATER \nPoppa M, the brothers and Romeo walk kneel at the altar before a memorial to McKinney: Candles, pictures, cards, flowers etc. \nAs they pray, a dozen or so church patrons who are in the pews begin to realize who they are. Our foursome stands and walks back down the aisle. They make eye contact with a few people. \nWhen the Saints are gone, the churchgoers gather in the aisle and stare at the front door in disbelief. Excited whisperings. One guy opens his cell phone. Then he thinks...and closes it. \nINT. FBI HEAD QUARTERS -- MOMENTS LATER \nG-man #2 excitedly gives Kuntsler a file.   His eyes widen. \nINT. INTERROGATION ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER \nKuntsler slaps the file down in front of Jimmy who is cuffed to a metal table. He looks at a picture of the Roman. Fear. \nINT. SUV -- MOMENTS LATER \nKuntsler and his men speed along sirens blaring.    Into walkie... \nKUNTSLER This is S.A.I.C., Jonathan Buford Kuntsler! Security code A4153B!

DEAD END STREET -- SAME TIME \nThe Roman's common, two story home looms in the b.g. at the end of a cul-de-sac. Walking down the middle of the street, is Poppa M: black trench, hat, dark shades. He opens the door and enters the... \nINT. COMMON HOME -- CONTINUOUS \nPoppa M listens, far off scratchy music. He moves quietly through the house, stopping at the foot of the stairs...listens. He removes his rosary, hangs it on the banister and moves on, pulling a weapon. \nINT. GREENHOUSE -- SAME TIME \n", "test2_true": "The Roman sits in front of a sunken fire pit at a low flame. Across the pit, an empty chair. Extended before him is a stunning garden, standing in stark contrast to the common house: vines, flowers, cobblestone walks, fountains. The center piece is a Turkish pool with pure white Lillys afloat. Poppa M slowly approaches the Roman from behind. He holsters his weapon and sits. The Roman halts the phonograph. \nPOPPA M Hello, Louie. \nROMAN Noah. \nLong pause. \nPOPPA M We haven't much time. \nThe Roman smiles and gestures the surroundings. \nROMAN My garden. She is beautiful, yes?     Ah, but you. You are blind to beauty.     You are a destroyer, Noah. \nPOPPA M You know my reasons.   You know why I did what I did. \nROMAN But do you? You think it was for your father? No. You were born a killer. Death...is in the very blood that runs through your veins. \nPOPPA M No. \nROMAN Then explain this. \nThe Roman flicks a photo over. It lands in Poppa M's lap.    It is the picture we saw earlier. A woman holding two babies. \nROMAN (CONT'D) You were not there to raise them. Not a single day. Yet, how closely they follow in the footsteps of their father. They have inherited your blood, Noah...your anger. \nPoppa M looks at the photo deeply. \nEXT. BEHIND GREENHOUSE -- SAME TIME \nOutside, back wall of greenhouse.    THUGs 1-5 from Patronazzi, hunker down here. They are all armed. \nTHUG #1 (whispered into walkie) Remember, not a scratch on the Old Man. \nINT. PARLOR, UPSTAIRS -- SAME TIME \nWe look out the bay windows. It is a straight shot down the slanted roof to the roof of the greenhouse. THUGS 6-8 stand quietly inside. \nTHUG #6 Got it.   Wait for the signal. \nINT. HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER \nA gloved hand grabs up Poppa M's rosary.    Connor pockets it as he and Murphy silently climb the stairs. \nINT. / EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS -- SAME TIME \nS.W.A.T. teams load into vans.   Squad cars speed through traffic. \nINT. GREENHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER \nPoppa M tosses the picture into the fire. \nPOPPA M And you?   What are you? \nThe Roman denotes his garden. \nROMAN I am a creator. You see? Our very natures stood in opposition as old as the story of the scorpion and the frog. \nPOPPA M Why...did you sell me out, Louie? \nROMAN You can never understand. \nPOPPA M 25 years....try me. \nROMAN I wanted to join with them. They were building an empire. Creating something and I was helping them! I used you, Noah, to eliminate their problems, to destroy their competition, to cut out their cancers. I earned my place among them. \nPoppa M looks around. \nPOPPA M Is this your place among them? Because all I see is a an old man, sitting in a garden. \nROMAN Alas, the scorpion and the frog both lost everything, yes? I should have paid more attention to the story. \n(MORE) \nROMAN (CONT'D) Without you...I was no longer useful to them. They cast me out! \nINT. SUV -- MOMENTS LATER \nKuntsler barks into a walkie... \nKUNTSLER The location is to be surrounded and secured upon arrival! Nobody goes in! \nHe suddenly looks out his window to the sky.    In the distance, two other copters fly in the same direction. \n", "test2_id": 1450, "test3_input": "KUNTSLER (CONT'D) Are those fucking news choppers?! \nINT. GREENHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER \nPOPPA M Why the priest, Louie?     Why all this? Why, now? \nROMAN Because I knew it would bring you and your sons. You would destroy the Yakavettas and clear my way. This time, I will take what is rightfully mine. Just a little piece, for my old age. After all, I have never been a greedy man. \nThe Roman puts the needle back on the record.    Jazz plays. \nINT. PARLOR, UPSTAIRS -- SAME TIME \nTHUG #6 That's it!   Move! \nAnother Thug opens the bay windows.    Thundering music! \nINT. NEIGHBORING ROOM -- SAME TIME \nBIRD'S EYE VIEW: Looking down on Connor and Murphy.    They rapid fire their huge .50 cals through the wall. \nINT. PARLOR -- SAME TIME \nSLO-MO: The heavy rounds blast through the wall and massacre the three Thugs as they are about to exit. \nINT. BACK OF GREENHOUSE -- SAME TIME \nAll following visuals in slo-mo with slamming music... \nPoppa \"M\" stands, throwing open his trench and revealing his leather vest, a six gun rig in the front. The Roman in awe. \nThe double doors crash in and men barrel through as Poppa M turns, pulls two weapons and fires upon them, hitting one. \nThe boys crash through the glass ceiling of the greenhouse on either side of Poppa M. They fire as they fall, hit the ground and roll. \nRomeo bursts into the fray from inside the house, blasting away with his gold .45's, a shotgun hanging on his back. \nThe garden is being torn apart as the brothers, Poppa M and Romeo hit their marks and the hit squad returns fire. The boys dive behind fountains which are then pulverized. \nThe gun battle rages around the Roman who remains seated in the very mouth of madness. His heart breaks as his sanctuary is shredded. \nRomeo fires as a large rack of wine behind him is torn apart. \nMurphy fires over a statue and bodies crash into the pool. \nConnor stands, firing in a Jesus Christ pose. \nPoppa M drops his empty weapons and pulls two more, laying down a second barrage. \nRomeo is simultaneously hit in the leg and shoulder. He falls, dropping his .45s. He struggles to fire the shotgun. \nPoppa M takes one in the chest. \nConnor is wounded in the shoulder but continues firing. \nMurphy is hit in the leg but continues firing. The boys and Romeo manage to take out the last of the Thugs, who are blasted into the Turkish pool. It is over. The music fades... \nEXT. FRONT OF HOME -- MOMENTS LATER \nSquad cars screech to a halt as the chopper lands behind them. Kuntsler exits, shouting orders. Many officers level over their hoods as S.W.A.T. piles out and moves toward. \nINT. GREENHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER \nThe Roman looks around, tears in his eyes.   The boys hobble to their failing father who is on his knees. \nCONNOR AND MURPHY Da? \nPOPPA M Boys.    Help me up. \nThey get him to his feet. Poppa M turns to the Roman. He levels a revolver toward the seated man. With his last bit of strength... \nPOPPA M (CONT'D) I'll see you in a minute, Louie. \nPoppa M fires one right between the Roman's eyes.    Poppa M crumbles. His sons lay him down. \nCONNOR Oh, no, no, no. \nPoppa M smiles as he looks up at the sun through the blown out glass ceiling. A plume of butterflies escape. \nPOPPA M It's a beautiful day. \nMURPHY Aye.    It is...it is, Da. \nHe dies. The brothers weep. Nearby, Romeo is slumped and bleeding, on the edge of consciousness. A strange calm comes over the brothers as they stand and look to one another. \nS.W.A.T. can be heard surrounding the perimeter. The boys look to Romeo. He smiles at them and nods. The brothers turn and walk into the house. The echoed voice of Poppa M. \n", "test3_true": "EXT. STREET -- MOMENTS LATER \nCops level over their squads.

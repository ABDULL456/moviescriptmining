SAM Anything who can think of? Can't fuck with.what guys? McClane punches buttons. But it's on override. 
MCCLANE Shit! 
SAM Big drug dealer on the way to prison. Gunfight in airport. Every controller in the coffee shop getting beeped and hauling ass, and you rocking the boat. A connection? Come on, McClane -Just a few words -?

97 CONTINUED - 97 
MCCLANE (opening the control 
PANEL) How about "fuck" and "you"? 
SAM I already got that from Colonel Stuart, thanks -! McClane STOPS as if zapped by a Taser. 
MCCLANE 
(REALIZING) Stuart! The guy who got canned by Congress - that's who he was- 
SAM Huh? Who he who? But McClane has already jumped up and grabbed the light fixture, and now in a gymnast's move KICKS out the ceiling hatch and disappears through the roof! (X) 
98 NEW ANGLE 98 The door opens. The GUARDS there REACT to the open ceiling. (X) Sam shrugs. 
SAM Claustrophobic, I guess. 
CUT TO: 
99 INT. CAB - NIGHT 99 
TILT UP from a big map of the airport. Lots of AD-LIB BRAINSTORMING, some of it breaking through - some how one reedy hesitant voice cuts through with nothing but confidence 
BARNES --guys, guys, all we have to do is find a way to transmit - (X) 
1ST ENGINEER 
(SARCASTIC) Yeah, right. Somebody run down to Radio Shack and get a transmitter- 
BARNES We have one. 
(POINTING OUTSIDE) The new terminal wing they're building? Twenty airlines when it's done?

BARNES (CONT'D) All with their reservation computers, all tied into a nice big antenna array so they can talk to their home offices- it's just sitting there waiting to go on line - 
I 2ND ENGINEER That's VHF - it'll scatter - 
BARNES 
I Doesn't matter; The planes we want to reach are right overhead. I could rig our frequency in - 30 minutes... wire in a crossover and we're hot. The planes wouldn't even know the difference. 
TRUDEAU Get what you need. Borrow, steal, kill. 
LORENZO (heading for the elevator) I want my Swat team to go with him as cover. (firm, tough) Whatever we can think of - they can think of, too. He says it like he thought of it himself. Then - 
STUART'S VOICE Attention, Tower. You have two more minutes to stack the planes in your inbound pattern over your outside radio marker. After that you will be able.to receive only. Any attempt to restore your systems will be met by severe penalties. At the elevator, Lorenzo pauses - stage WHISPERS - 
LORENZO He's bluffing - Lorenzo leaves. Trudeau ain't so sure. 
TRUDEAU 
(TO STUART) Damn it, you can't do this -! 
STUART I am doing this.

99 CONTINUED - (2) 99 
TRUDEAU (pause; to Barnes) Put me on all bands... Trudeau waits as switches are thrown, and then takes the jack from the ear/phone he wears and jacks it into a panel. 
TRUDEAU This is Dulles approach to all aircraft holding.at Potomic Vortac. We are experiencing... 
(PAUSE) Severe technical problems here.

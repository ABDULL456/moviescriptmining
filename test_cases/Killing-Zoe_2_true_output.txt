Eric slams the phone down and then in a fit of rage tears the phone from the wall.

The sub lobby guard #2 braces himself for gunfire. 
Eric fires into him.  He is dead instantly. 
Everybody screams. 
Eric fires into his dead corpse until his gun runs out of bullets. 
ERIC [That's what you get!] 
Claude puts his hand on Eric's shoulder. 
CLAUDE Eric. 
Eric looks at him.

CLAUDE [And what if we gave up?] 
Eric can't believe this.

ERIC [My only mistake was not to make an example of a woman to begin with.]

McQueen and Mater exit the Doc Hudson Museum. 
MCQUEEN Alright, pal. I've been waiting all summer for this. What've you got planned? 
MATER You sure you can handle it? 
MCQUEEN Come on, you know who you're talking to? This is Lightning McQueen. I can handle anything. 
EXT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - DAY 
Mater and McQueen roll on an old train track, their tires off. They're on their rims. 
MCQUEEN Uh.... Mater?! 
MATER Just remember, your brakes ain't gonna work on these! 
As they head INTO A DARK TUNNEL --- 
MCQUEEN (O.S.) Mater! 
MATER (O.S.) Relax, these train tracks ain't been used in years! 
From inside the tunnel a loud TRAIN HORN. The two friends emerge, going as fast as they can on train tracks, uphill, with no tires. 
MCQUEEN Come on, come on! Faster, faster! 
Moments later a harmless GALLOPING GOOSE appears, oversized horn visible, cackling and laughing at his prank. 
EXT. FIELD - OUTSIDE RADIATOR SPRINGS - LATER 
An ENORMOUS EARTH MOVER sleeps. McQueen and Mater sneak up. 
MATER This is gonna be good! 
They blow their horns and he TIPS OVER, tractor-tipping style. They LAUGH at the gag, but soon realize the earth mover's GIANT EXHAUST PIPE is directly above them. 
MATER Uh-oh. This ain't gonna be good. 
The exhaust pipe BELCHES. McQueen and Mater are BLASTED out of view. 
INT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - DUSK 
The sun sets. McQueen and Mater roll into town. McQueen looks exhausted. Mater is still full of energy. 
MATER Boy, this was the best day ever! And my favorite souvenir? 
Mater proudly shows off a dent. 
MATER This new dent! 
MCQUEEN Boy, Mater. Today was, uh... 
MATER Shoot, that was nothing. Wait til you see what I got planned for tonight. 
MCQUEEN Mater, Mater. Whoa. I was kind of thinking of just a quiet dinner. 
MATER That's exactly what I was thinking. 
MCQUEEN No, I... I meant with Sally, Mater. 
MATER Even better! You, me and Miss Sally going out for supper. 
McQueen pulls around in front of Mater, stops. 
MCQUEEN Mater, I meant it would be just me and Sally. 
MATER Oh. 
MCQUEEN It's just for tonight. We'll do whatever you want tomorrow. 
MATER (DISAPPOINTED) Okay. 
MCQUEEN Thanks for understanding. 
MATER Yeah, sure. Y'all go on and have fun now. 
MCQUEEN Alright, then. See ya soon, amigo! 
McQueen drives off. Mater watches him go. 
EXT. THE WHEEL WELL - NIGHT 
It's been converted into a white-tablecloth restaurant, with cars dining al fresco and a hopping gastropub inside. 
MCQUEEN AND SALLY have a prime table with a view of Radiator Springs and the starry night sky. 
SALLY This is so nice. 
MCQUEEN I can't tell you how good it is to be here alone. Just the two of us. Finally, you and me --- 
MATER (O.S.) Good evening. 
Mater is at their table, dressed as a waiter. 
MATER My name is Mater and I'll be your waiter. (TO HIMSELF) Mater the waiter. That's funny right there. 
MCQUEEN Mater, you work here? 
MATER Well yeah I work here. What'd you think, I just snuck in here when nobody was looking and pretended to be your waiter, just so I could hang out with you? 
McQueen and Sally exchange a look. 
MCQUEEN Oh, yeah. How ridiculous would that be?

BURT GRUSINSKY No--it's better this way. I don't want him sitting around with nothing to do, feeling useless-- 
Bobby is about to leave.     Burt stops him: 
BURT GRUSINSKY (CONT'D) Hey, c'mere. (Bobby returns) A lotta people been talking. About how good you did. (BEAT) And I think maybe...considering the alternatives... (BEAT) ...maybe you might wanna think about joining the Department. 
BOBBY GREEN POP-- 
BURT GRUSINSKY I could pull some strings, get you through the academy with an early LEAVE-- 
BOBBY GREEN No, come on! I don't want that! (BEAT) What I did, I did for you guys, this once. I got my own plans. 
Bobby motions to his bodyguard. Burt senses he's said the wrong thing. Gently tries to stop him: 
BURT GRUSINSKY Wait--Don't go yet-- 
BOBBY GREEN (to the Guard) Take me back to the motel. 
With that, Bobby leaves with his bodyguard. Burt stands there for a moment, frustrated. TEDDY, his grandson, runs past him. Naked. Sandra follows the boy. Burt turns to see the naked youngster, then to Sandra: 
BURT GRUSINSKY Can't you put some clothes on him? 
EXT. METS MOTEL - EARLY EVENING 
It's a cheesy hotel on Queens Boulevard. TWO UNMARKED CARS pull up. Armed Guards exit the autos first, casing the area. They're followed by Bobby. 
INT. MOTEL - HALLWAY 
Bobby approaches his room. A Guard, we'll call him VITT, is outside the room holding his shotgun. Nods a "hello". Bobby moves past him, opens the door. The ROOM is EMPTY. 
BOBBY GREEN Rosario?    Rosario! 
A beat.   Then Bobby spins around, furious: 
BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D) WHERE THE FUCK IS SHE?!? 
INT. EL CARIBE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT 
A number of PEOPLE are HERE. It's PACKED. We are on the DANCE FLOOR. MUSIC: GRANDMASTER FLASH'S "WHITE LINES". ROSARIO DIAZ is in the center of the crowded floor, dancing up a storm. She is having a GREAT TIME, surrounded by many would-be male suitors and Louis. She is laughing and stoned, and her gyrations are wonderfully erotic and free. As she moves, she pushes the men away with a smile. All, of course, except for Louis. Louis dances a CAN CAN with two amused girls. Though fat, he's surprisingly graceful. 
ALL OF A SUDDEN: COMING THROUGH THE CROWD: BOBBY. When Louis sees his friend, he lights up. Bobby's furious inside, but strangely calm outside: 
LOUIS FALSETTI Bobkes!!! 
Bobby GLARES at Rosario. He takes her arm, starts to walk her out. She tries to pull Bobby toward the dancing: 
ROSARIO DIAZ C'mon, honey--let's dance! 
BOBBY GREEN The cops're right outside--let's go. (beat; louder) I said, let's go! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ROSARIO DIAZ You don't gotta yell at me, Bobby. (starts to move to DOOR) ...[I] was just trying to have a little fun for once, that's all... 
BOBBY GREEN Lou--no more of this for her.   It's too fuckin' dangerous now. 
LOUIS FALSETTI (SINCERE) Sure, Bobkes. I mean, she come here. 
Bobby grabs Rosario by the elbow.     She yanks it away: 
ROSARIO DIAZ Wait!   Lemme get my coat at least! 
Rosario moves toward the coat check, and Bobby follows.      As he does, Louis walks with him: 
LOUIS FALSETTI You know Bob, everyone's been askin' `bout you. We was all real surprised to hear about your family- -I mean, your father's like J. Edgar Hoover-- 
BOBBY GREEN Yeah--we'll talk later, buddy--I'll call you. But right now I need to get her outta here. 
Louis nods, understanding. 
EXT. OUTSIDE THE EL CARIBE 
Rosario leads Bobby back toward the ESCORT CAR.      He leans forward, grabs her arm. Sotto but intense: 
BOBBY GREEN You gotta put everything in jeopardy? Huh? 
ROSARIO DIAZ No! I was just dancing! I didn't say nothing! 
BOBBY GREEN You know, I don't think you realize how serious this is? (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D) (BEAT) We gotta ride this out, `til this fuckin' thing is over. `Til I can get things back on track. 
Looking down at the ground, she exhales. Hits the side of a nearby car gently with the palm of her hand, frustrated. 
ROSARIO DIAZ Bobby, what do you want from me? I can't go out, I can't do nothing-- it's like I'm in a jail-- 
BOBBY GREEN I know. But I'm workin' on it, I am. (looks around; then) Soon as the trial's over and I get my money back outta impound-- everything'll get better, you'll see. 
She gets emotional.    Shrugs: 
ROSARIO DIAZ It's just, I feel...I feel like it's just you and all those cops all the time. And they look at me like I'm a piece of shit. 
Bobby tries to comfort her, reaches out to her arm.      As tears come out of her eyes: 
BOBBY GREEN Rosario--once this's done, we'll go down to Miami... [It'll] be a new thing for us--a lotta opportunities... (BEAT) I'll talk to Mr. Buzhayev about working for his brother down there. We'll get your mother to come too-- I'll even talk to Jumbo about it.

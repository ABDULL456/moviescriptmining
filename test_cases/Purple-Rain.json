Electric word life, It means forever and that's a mighty long time. But I'm here to tell you that there's something else -- The afterworld. \nThen huge CU of EYES opening, gazing into mirror, HAND applying makeup, sudden BLACKNESS, then-- \nPRINCE (con't) That's right...a world of never-ending happiness, You can always see the sun -- Day or night. \nBURN IN MAIN TITLE:    PURPLE RAIN \nPRINCE (con't) So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills, You know the one -- Doctor Everything'll Be Alright-- Instead of asking him how much of your mind is left, Ask him how much of your time, `Cause in this life, Things are much harder than in the afterworld, In this life, You're on your own. \nNow,  pulsating COLOR -- FLASHES of hot, white LIGHT... \nPRINCE (con't) And if de-elevator tries to bring you down, Go crazy, punch a higher floor. \nand the BEAT provocative now, relentless, BUILDING with fierce intent to-- \n(2)  INT. CLUB (1ST AVE.  ST.  BAR) -- NIGHT \nThe MECCA!  The last stop for a band before national fame. \nThe HUGE cavernous HALL is PACKED! PEOPLE are DANCING like MAD! VIDEO SCREENS with WILD GRAPHICS hang suspended from the ceilings. Beautiful WAITRESSES criss-cross the floor in a frenzy. \nPRINCE is CENTER-STAGE -- LIPS caressing the mike, black, lustrous hair shining, eyes dancing -- SINGING \"Let's Get Crazy\" as the CROWD pulsates beneath the LASER  LIGHTS. \nThe MUSIC  continues as we ... \nCUT TO: \n(3) EXT.  STREETS #1 -- NIGHT \nA TAXI pulls UP with a SCREECH.  VANITY slouches in the backseat.  Black  boots, black skin-tight pants, and a mane of thick, black hair presents a beautiful and imposing  figure. Her eyes are large and dark -- her look open and ripe.  She knows what she's got, and doesn't make any excuses for it -- but the fact is she's scared as hell, possessing a  vulnerability that surprises her by its suddenness.  An expensive gold chain is fastened on one boot. \nShe scrounges through her bag -- pulls out her remaining cash. It's drastically short of what she owes and she knows it. She tosses it onto the front seat, JUMPS from the cab, streaks across the street.  The CABBIE lets out a YELL and JUMPS out after her. \n\"Let's Get  Crazy\" continues as we ... \nCUT TO: \n(4) INT.  SHOWER, MORRIS' APT. -- NIGHT \nMORRIS DAY stands in the shower, steam whirling about his face.  He's 22 years old, matinee-idol sexy with large, dark, bedroom eyes.  He headlines a slick techno-funk group called THE TIME which sports gangster suits and wide-brimmed hats. He's gifted with a wealth of self- laudatory humor which he uses like a knife, moving through life with a calm, but ruthless grace. \nMake no mistake, Morris is nobody's fool.   His seeming out-raceousness, his charm -- every move he makes is for a calculated effect.  He knows exactly what the ladies need, and doesn't mind reminding them should they forget ... \nHe breaks into a wide grin.  Hair standing up like Don King, he wipes off a hand mirror, regards himself unabashedly as he brushes his teeth. \n\"Let's Get Crazy\" continues as we... \nCUT TO: \n(5) INT.  BASEMENT,  PRINCE'S HOME -- NIGHT \nPrince sits in front of the mirror, finishes applying his makeup.  Black hair flowing, eyes wide and fantastic, he regards himself a moment before jumging up.  He puts on a high-collared overcoat, grabs his guitar  moves quickly to the basement window.  He hoists himself through it, disappears into the night. \n\"Let's Get Crazy\" continues as we ... \nCUT TO: \n... KIDS are crowded in front of the CLUB.  A YELLOW CADDY SCREECHES up in front.   TRAFFIC is jammed all around. The night is electric -- the scene beckons ... \n(14) INT.  VANITY'S HALLWAY -- NIGHT \nShe runs from the room, cuts down the hallway, slanming the door behind her \n\"Let's Get Crazy\" continues as we... \nCUT TO: \n(15) EXT.  CLUB (1st AVE.  ST.  BAR) -- NIGHT \nJerome opens the door of the CADDY, helps Morris out.  The CROWD recognizes them immediately, rushes in for a closer look.   Morris loves the attention, plays to their enthusiasm with a relish. Jerome snaps a comb into his hand, holds up a pocket mirror ... \nMorris combs his hair dramatically, the Crowd encouraging him on.  Jerome gives him the OK sign, ushers him into the club. \n\"Let's Get Crazy\" continues as we... \nCUT TO: \n(16) INT.  CLUB (1st  AVE.  ST.  BAR) -- NIGHT \nPrince onstage performing \"Let's Get Crazy.\"   He's locked into a guitar solo, moving provocatively with Wendy. The CROWD is packed onto the DANCE FLOOR, thick against the stage. \nJerome makes his way through the crowd, blazing a path for Morris who is surrounded by a dozen BABES. Occasionally Morris glances at Prince -- discloses by his look that he doesn't care much for his act -- or his music... \nHe breaks off from the Girls, follows Jerome to the backstage entrance where they're joined by other MEMBERS of The Time -- JESSE and JELLYBEAN among them. Morris casts another glance toward Prince, breaks into a self-satisfied grin-- \nMORRIS We're going to slay him... (screams) Whawhak! \n\"Let's Get Crazy\" continues as we... \nCUT TO: \n(17) EXT.  CLUB -- NIGHT \nCOMMOTION! The CROWD has become unwieldly -- TRAFFIC is snarled all around.  HORNS are BLARING.   COPS try desperately to ward off the inevitable grid lock. \nVanity runs against the light, moves to the head of the queue to the accompaniment of JEERS and CATCALLS. She doesn't budge an inch, KNOCKS rapidly on the glass door, catching the attention of CHICK, a burly, 6'5\", 285 pound bouncer with a white beard and long flowing hair.  An ex-Marine, Chick's function is obvious.  He cracks the door-- \nCHICK What? \nVANITY I have an appointment with the manager. \nCHICK No you don't -- he doesn't see anybody. \nSuddenly a FIGHT breaks out at the INSIDE MONEY WINDOW.  Chick spins instantly, SLAMS the door -- but Vanity jams her boot into the narrow space. The door crashes against her instep, she winces in pain --but Chick doesn't notice.  He's already upon the OFFENDERS,  heaving them against the wall. \nVanity streaks inside, blazes up the stairway, ducks behind a GROUP of GIRLS... \nCHICK turns instantly -- the door is closed -- VANITY, gone.  His eyes dart up the stairway -- nothing.  He shrugs, drags the Two Guys off. \n(18) INT.  CLUB -- UPPER BAR AREA -- NIGHT \nVANITY watches as he moves away.   She jumps up, lunges onto the dance floor, CRASHES into a waitress, JILL, whose tray SMASHES to the floor-- \nJILL What are you retarded or something?! Why don't you look where you're going? \nShe's 18 years old, blonde and pretty in a cute, innocent way.   A Daisy Mae-type whose emotions form so quickly, she has trouble sorting them out.  Right now she's mad as hell -- she thinks-- \nVANITY Sorry ... where's the office? \nJill squats, picks up the broken glasses- \nJILL Do you think you can just come in here and take over? \nVANITY I said I'm sorry -- what do you want me to do?  Where's the office? \nJill points -- Vanity hurries away  -- \nJILL (triumphantly) No one's in! \nVANITY Hey  wait! \nBut Prince is too far away, the traffic too coneested for him to hear.  He whips down the street, disappears around the corner. \nVanity continues running, then slows, dejection overcoming her in waves.  She looks around -- KIDS are staring at her, passing  jokes.  Embarrassed, She moves to the front door but Chick is there, his eyes upon her cold, impassionate. \nExhausted and slighlty tearlul, she cuts across the street, heads back to her apartment. \n(20) EXT. PRINCE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT \nPrince WHIPS down the street, cuts his motor, coasts up the drive. He comes to a stop against a wooden gate.  His house is a nondescript, one-family structure with a wide front porch.  He lives in a neat and tidy, homogeneous, lower middle- class neighborhood whose occupants are hard-working type fiercely protective of their privacy. \nHe climbs the steps to the porch, opens the front door... \n...his mothers SCREAM is like ice in his veins.  Fear trickles into the hollows of his body like cold water,  His pain commands him to move, but the impulse short circuits somewhere at the waist, leaving his legs twitching uncontrollably.  Then another SCREAM from his mother, and his father's voice now, LOUD and FURIOUS-- \nFATHER (O.S.) Listen to me!  You come home when I say come home!  You've got no business in the streets! \nWHACK!  His mother SCREAMS -- Prince BURSTS into the room. \n(21) INT. Prince's LIVING ROOM --  NIGHT \nPrince's MOTHER is at the far side of the living room CRYING uncontrollable. She's in her early 40's, a dark-haired, faded beauty, with large, wild, anxious eyes.  There's a detectable scent of liquor in the air, and her slurred speech pins her as the source. \nHis FATHER is in his late 40's, a squat, but solidly built black man, with a cherubic face, and graceful expressive hands. \nHe's upon her now, WHACKING! at her horribly, trying to get to her face-- \nFATHER You do what I say, do you hear me?!  You've got to keep this place clean!  You here, no place else! \nMOTHER You're crazy! \nWHACK! \nMOTHER Asshole! \nWHACK! \nMOTHER Motherfucker!!! \nThe Father lunges, WHACKS! her across the face.  She topples to the floor, a lamp CRASHES to the ground.  Prince cuts through the room, lunges desperately in front of him-- \nPRINCE (pleading) Please, Dad...she's heard you. She's had enough! \nHis Mother drags herself up along the wall-- \nMOTHER (hysterical) He's  trying to kill me!  He's crazy!  Look what he's doing to me! \nPRINCE (tearfully) Dad,  please ... she's-- \nWHACK!   Prince's head snaps back, his feet lift from the floor, his body CRASHES in a heap by the door... \nStunned SILENCE.  Prince, flat on his back, fights vertigo with everything he's got.  His Mother lets out a YELP, rushes into the bedroom, SLAMS the door. His Father stands motionless, sullen-- \nFATHER Get up...you ain't hurt. \nPrince opens his Mouth, BLOOD gushes from a gash in his tongue.  He hoists himself up slowly, using the wall for support.  He moves into the kitchen, disappears down the basement steps. \n(22) BASEMENT -- HALLWAYS AND BEDROOM -- NIGHT \nA naked LIGHT BULB snaps ON.  It dangles like a pendulum, casting strange shadows.  The basement is partitioned off into a series of rooms, interconnected by a labyrinthine coimbination of passages.  An old washer and dryer stand in the corner. \nPrince descends the steps slowly.  He comes through a door, closes it behind him.  He moves down a narrow passageway, enters a small cramped BEDROOM. \nHe closes the door and locks it behind him.  MOONLIGHT filters in throuch the cacement windows.  The total effect is like entering a womb, a deep dark chamber of security and safety. \nLying heavily onto his bed, he sighs long and deep, his eyes piercing the darkness... \nFADE OUT: \nFADE IN: \n(25) EXT.  STREETS AND ALLEY -- DOWNTOWN -- DAY \nMorris and Jerome move briskIy down the sidewalk-- \nMORRIS This just ain't happening. The bitches are okay, but we need something more exciting- \nJEROME You're right.  We could be doing much better.  Any ideas? \nMORRIS That powder fine babe we saw last night. \nJEROME Oooh, yeee! -- Why don't we find out who she is? \nMorris snaps an address in front of his face-- \nMORRIS I already know that.  Jill gave me everything last night. Whawhak! \nJEROME Then what are we waiting for? Let's go! \nMORRIS No, no -- that ain't classy enough.  I want the bitch to come to me -- I'm the only star in this town. \nSuddenly  a BEAUTIFUL BABE lunges into the sidewalk from the alley-- \nBABE (yelling) Morris Day, who do you think you are?!  I waited up all night for you.  I'm so tired of you doing that  to me. You think you're so hot?  You're nothing special.  This is the third time you pulled that shit.  Who the fuck do you think I am?! \nMORRIS Jerome! \nJerome puts the girl in a headlock, DRAGS her into the alley-- \nBABE (screaming) Leave me alone you ape! -- What are you doing to me?! Morris!! \nHe flings her into the dumpster, SLAMS the lid with a CRASH.  Morris pats his brow-- \nMORRIS Lo-rd..!  Such nastiness. (a beat) Hee, hee -- Let's break. \nThey streak across the street, double- time it to the CADDY.  A COP sweeps by, gives them a curious look.  Morris puts on a dignified air, then stops, stupified-- \nMORRIS Jerome, this car -- it's...it's lacking something. What do you think? \nJEROME Hmm... I don't know... \nMORRIS I got it!  The hubcaps.  We need something sweeter. \nJEROME I think I know what it needs. \nMorris is pondering his Stacy Adams-- \nMORRIS Yeah ... I know what these need. \n(26) INT.  SHOESHINE STAND -- DOWNTOWN -- DAY \nMorris sits in the chair, his Stacy Adams worked on by an old, grizzled SHOESHINE BOY in his mid-sixties, with large jowls and silver close-cropped hair.  Jerome stands nearby, watches intently-- \nMORRIS (musing) The girl has expensive tastes. I wonder if she can sing. \nJEROME As fine as she is...she doesn't have to know how to sing. \nMORRIS (grace) I know that's right. (to Shoeshine) Hey -- watch it now. \nThe Shoeshine Boy looks up balefully -- Morris smiles, then grits his teeth-- \nMORRIS I want you to stay out of the set tonight.  I want you to work the floor. \nJEROME What for? \nMORRIS I want to know when that sweet thing shows up.  You stay by the door, you see her, you come get me, cool? \nJEROME Cool.  I come get you -- let you know the girl's there. \nMORRIS Well, not if I'm with my other babes.  That wouldn't be cool. I don't want to break their hearts, and you know how I feel abouy that.  So we ought to have like, a signal. \nJEROME A password. \nas she stops suddenly and stares transfixed.  A YOUNG WOMAN, startingly similiar to her in looks and coloring, tries on a beautiful bridal gown as a SEAMSTRESS adjusts the hem.  The entire scene is warm and endearing.  Vanity is struck by lt's beauty and seems to sigh. The Young Woman looks up suddenly, catches Vanity's gaze, and gives her an affectionate smile.  Vanity smiles back avidly, then-- \nPRINCE (0.  S .) Give me that. \nShe looks up startled-- \nPRINCE There ... on your boot. \nShe looks  down -- it's the expensive gold chain.  She hesitates, then hands it to him.  He drops it into his pocket, walks away-- \nVANITY Hey, wait! \nShe runs after him-- \nVANITY Give it back to mel \nHe continues to walk briskly -- she starts pulling on his coat-- \nPRINCE You can have it back later. \nVANITY I want it back now, okay? \nPRINCE Who gave it to you? \nVANITY A person \nPRINCE Female or male? \nVANITY Huh ... \nPRINCE You're lying.  I can tell just by your reaction that you're lying. \nHe moves away briskly -- Vanity stands her ground, amused-- \nPRINCE So you gave it to me -- it's not yours anymore. \nHe stops short -- something has caught his eye.  She's curious, comes up behind him, then-- \nVANITY You see something you like? \nHe puts on his sunglasses.  A GUITAR stands prominently in the window. \nPRINCE Let's go for a ride. \nHe flips her the gold chain' -- turns hastily.  She weighs it in her hand, studies the guitar-- \nVANITY It's pretty. \n(28) EXT.  HIGHWAY -- DUSK \nPrince and Vanity on his MOTORCYCLE blazing down the HIGHWAY, twisting through TRAFFIC.  The CITY is behind them, receding into the distance. \n(29) Ext. COUNTRYSIDE -- DUSK \nThey pull off an access road, drop down a small embankment, ride down a narrow, dirt road. \nLAKESIDE \nThe pull to a stop.  A LAKE stretches before them.  Vanity gets off the bike, walks around exploring, casting curious glances at Prince.  He stands by the water, idly tossing stones-- \nVANITY My psychic told rne I was going to be famous. \nPRINCE How much did that cost you? \nVANITY Fifty bucks.  It was a good investment. \nHe doesn't respond -- she suddenly feels shy-- \nVANITY No seriously -- My psychic did tell me.  I was in a play once. \nPRINCE Oh, yeah -- what did you play? \nMUSIC.  The CLUB is PACKED!  THE MODERN AIRES is onstage, a hi-techno funk group, performing their trademark, a frenzied song entitled \"Modern Aire\" The floor is dense with KIDS, all performing the same syncopated dance. \nPRINCE moves through the club slowly, seems to be searching someone out.  His face is drawn and haggard, his spirits strained.  He cuts past the BAR, barely acknowledges Jill, or the other WAITRESSES by her side, KIM and KATY. Jill looks concerned-- \nKIM Honey, you still chasing after that fool? \nKim is 21 years and gorgeous, with dark eyes, a smooth sculpted face, and taut shapely legs.  She is street-educated and doesn't need encouraging to speak her mind.  Katy is also in her-early 20's, a tall, alluring Oriental, with an attractive, intelligent face-- \nJILL I'm doing what I'm doing. It's my business. \nKATY He doesn't even look at you. That's the last thing you want from a man. \nJILL You just don't know him like I do. \nKIM Honey... Look, Listen, and then Feel.  If you do them in any other order, you're headed for trouble. \nMatt and Bobby (members of Prince's group) stroll up-- \nBOBBY Hey, Jill -- where's our drinks? \nJILL They're coming -- just wait. \nMatt stares hungrily at her breasts-- \nJILL What you want isn't on the menu. \nBOBBY Jill, in ten years they'll be on the table. \nShe swats him with her order pad -- Bobby ducks, taunts her-- \nBOBBY C'mon, c'mon ... \nShe goes to swing, Matt moves in, squeezes her breasts-- \nMATT (horn sound) BooPoo!! \nKIM Get out of here, you jerks! \nMATT Sweetheart ... do you have a real hot place where I could stick my nose? \nKIM Sure -- try a microwave. \nThe Guys bust up, head for their tables- \nKATY Those guys are deep. \nKIM Yeah -- deeply retarded. \n(31) INT./EXT. CLUB -- MONEY WINDOW -- NIGHT \nVanity stands in line waiting to get in. She wears a short, black dress and red heels, carries a black and red clutchbag.  Her hair is swept back and wind-blown, her eyes dark and dancing. She looks wickedly wonderful and knows it. \nCHICK stands by the window, arms folded, as massive as a Sequoia.  He regards her suspiciously-- \nVANITY (sweetly) I'm paying ... see? (to cashier, gruff) Keep the change. \nChick advances on her -- her eyes widen with fear-- \nCHICK The manager wants to see you. \nVANITY Really..?  Oh, great...like to see him too. \nShe breaths a sigh of relief. \nJEROME watches as Chick escorts Vanity to the upper level.  He stays short distance behind. \n(32) INT. CLUB UPPER LEVEL -- NIGHT \nas Vanity and Chick come to a  halt in the middle of the f Ioor-- \nCHICK He'll be right with you. \nJEROME (smiles) Ye-es. \n(33) INT.  DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT \nPrince and his band (Mark, Bobby, Matt, Lisa) sit backstage, waiting to go on. An air of tension permeates the room. Lisa sits in the corner and fidgets, casts sidelong looks to Prince.  He sits apart from the group, deathly silent, locked in thouqht. \nWendy walks in and shares a look with Lisa.  She goes up to Prince, her voice filled with nervousness-- \nWENDY Hi  ya, Prince.  I heard through the grapevine you had a new tune written by two great girls.  By chance did you hear it? \nHe stares at her -- if looks could kill Wendy would be dead-- \nLISA I knew it -- he didn't listen to it.  He probably dropped it under his bike and rolled over it. \nPrince grunts, turns away -- Wendy is amazed-- \nWENDY Wow! Okay...you think about this.  I'm going to be real honest with you.  You're really being full of shit. \nLISA Forget about it, Wendy.  Let's get out of here-- \nBut Wendy, agitated, silences her with a fierce gesture-- \nWENDY (to Prince) Every time we give you a song, you say you're going to use it, but you never do.  You always think that we're doing something behind your back. You're just being paranoid as usual. \nLISA Wendy... \nWENDY (upset) Shut up, Lisa, please! (to Prince) You should know by now that we wouldn't hurt vou.  We're not out to put a dark cloud over your head.  It's just to make you feel good, Prince -- that's what it's all about. You've been this way with us before, remember? \nPRINCE (maliciously) The nominees for the best actress are-- \nLISA -- Fuck it, Wendy -- let's break! \nWendy is shaking, tears spring to her eyes-- \nWENDY Do you know you can really, really hurt people?  Doesn't that mean anything to you? Doesn't that make you feel like shit? \nLISA C'mon ... \nWENDY I'm tired of this ... I'm really tired... \nThey leave the room, Wendy SLAMS the door behind her.  Prince casts a look to Bobby, Mark, Matt-- \nPRINCE You tired, too? \nMATT God got Wendy's periods reversed.  About every 28 days, she starts acting nice. Lasts about a weekend. \nThud.  The joke hangs suspended like a ball and chain.  Bobby gets up, the others follow him to the door-- \nBOBBY What difference does it make, Prince.  We're still a group, right? \nThey cut out the door. \n(34) INT.  HALLWAY -- NIGHT \nBobby, Matt and Mark move briskly to the stage-- \nMARK Headcase.  Telling you...'effed up headcase. \nBOBBY People with talent usually are. \nMatt dons his surgeon's mask -- Mark rolls his eyes-- \nMARK Of course, there are a number of headcases without great talent too. \n(35) INT/BACKSTAGE ENTRANCE/CLUB -- NIGHT \nMorris stands by the door surrounded by several delicious BABES.  One of them, wearing a tight, red dress, looks especially enticing.  Morris leans in closer -- her tasty breasts strain against the spandex material-- \nMORRIS Honey -- don't you ever try and breastfeed no baby now. \nGIRL Why not? \nHe whispers to Jerome-- \nMORRIS Get my change, will ya? \nJerome leaves, Morris purses his lips-- \nMORRIS Oh, Lord...either somebody put something in my drink, or you are the finest (motherfucker) I've seen in ages. \nVANITY Excuse me, what did you say? \nMORRIS Huh...you look nice tonight. \nHe leans in, speaks with a sexy voice-- \nMORRIS It's rare that I out my cards on the table when it comes to meeting younq ladies, but ... I'm going to make you love me. \nVANITY Is that a  fact? \nHe folds his legs dramatically, his Stacy Adams reflecting the light-- \nMORRIS Just as sure as my Stacy Adams are shiny. \nJust then-- \nM.C. (O.S.) Ladies and Gentlemen -- please welcome Prince! \nThe CLUB erupts in CRIES!  Prince hits the stage, launches into \"G-spot,\" a fast, high-spirited funk tune that gets the crowd hopping.  Vanity watches as Prince whips the crowd into a frenzy. Morris listens with a complacent grin on his face, his eyes searching out various members of The Time who are scattered through-out the club.  When he connects with one of them he makes a series of absurd faces which sends them into hysterics.  For Prince is playing music that The Time is noted for, and, as far as Morris is concerned, performs better. Not everyone in the club is dancing, or paying attention, and this does not escape his notice. \nSuddenly \"G-Spot\" comes to a rousing end.  The CROWD cheers wildly.  Prince moves quickly to the piano and launches into \"Electric Intercourse,\" a love ballad which, as it progresses, becomes a personal statement for Vanity and Prince himself. \nShe listens intently, her eyes fastened on him.  The words have a profound effect on her -- and the audience. Without being consciously aware of it, they're moving closer to the stage, searching for their personal fix. Prince surrenders himself to the music totally, releasing from himself all that is hurtful -- releasing the sincerity and truthfulness that escapes him in his daily life.  We are entering  realm where life and music are inextricably bound, and the impact on the performer and listener is profound. \nHe's directing his music toward her, and she receives it gratefully, almost anxiously.  It fills a void in her, hewn by a life of meaningless promises.  He searches her face with his magnificent eyes, and ends the song with a heartrending cry which connects with the souls of all present.  Everyone is paying attention now. \nThe stage is plunged into darkness.  The CROWD goes CRAZY!  Vanity applauds vigorously, wipes the tears from her eyes.  Morris, who was more affected by the performance than he'd care to admit, doesn't like what he sees and searches for a winning line-- \nMORRIS He doesn't like girls. \nShe's equal to the challenge-- \nVANITY I know -- he likes women. \nBut Morris can barely suppress a smile, and settles himself comfortably into his chair -- for he knows what Vanity has lost...at least this round-- \nMORRIS Well ... he don't do too good with them either. \nShe flashes him a quizzical look -- he simply smiles. \n(39) INT.  BACKSTAGE HALLIIAY -- NIGHT \nJubilation time!  Prince and his Band move through the hallway briskly, past the outstretched arms of admiring fans. There's a lot of back-slapping going on as the Musicians bask in the glow of well-wishers.  Prince moves past Billy Sparks, who has an angry look on his face-- \nBILLY What's this intercourse, shit? \nPRINCE Hey; man -- don't worry about it. \nBILLY I'm warning you... \nBut Prince ignores him, cuts into the dressing room-- \n(40) INT.  DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT \n--then stops suddenly, surprised.  He's muzzle to muzzle with a cuddly DOG, held up lovingly by Jill-- \nJILL Surprise! \nOOHS! and AAHS!  by  the entire group. Jill hesitates, then kisses Prince's cheek compulsively.  He's surprised, touched-- \nPRINCE Hey -- wait till we're married, now. \nShe fidgets, her face blushes red. Wendy is studying the dog-- \n(43) PRINCE'S POV -- INT.  LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT \nHis Mother and Father in the living room.  His Mother is sprawled out on the sofa, obviously drunk, her dress hiked along her thighs.  Her head rests in his Father's lap. \n(44) EXT.  BACKYARD -- NIGHT \nPrince hops from the pipe, leans coolly against the house. Intrigued. Vanity looks in-- \n(45) VANITY'S POV -- INT.  LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT \nThe mother and father kissing tentatively, then violently, finally pulling away.  The Mother seems to be taunting the Father, coaxing him into a trap.  He kisses her mouth lustily -- she pulls back snarling--. \n(46) EXT.  BACKYARD -- NIGHT \nVanity's scared -- tries to be cool-- \nVANITY So -- friends of yours? \nPRINCE Yeah -- the freak show. \nHe walks off.  She jumps off the pipe, follows. \nSIDE OF HOUSE \nas they emerge around the corner. Prince squats by a basement window, adjusts an old coal chute, then slides down it-- \nVANITY Hey... \nPRINCE (O.S.) C'mon. \nShe hesitates a moment, then slides down too. \n(47) INT.  BASEMENT, PRINCE'S HOME -- NIGHT \nHe turns on a LIGHT, disappears into an ADJOINING ROOM.  Vanity looks around amazed.  She stands in a small ANTE- CHAMBER whose walls are covered with thicks pads and foam. \nColorful MOBILES hang suspended from the ceilings -- various INSTRUMENTS lie about: a drumset, an electric guitar, and a small upright piano.  A stereo and cassette player. are perched on a shelf, and  two speakers are recessed into the walls.  The entire room looks hand- built, the wood carefully painted, or stained. \nShe peers through the doorway into the adjoining room.  BLUE MOONLIGHT filters in through the casement windows. Various MURALS are painted on the walls, MOBILES are suspended from the ceiling. A bed sits in the middle of the floor, a vanity table and mirror nearby. \nShe stands idly a mement, then moves around the antechamber.  Various KNICKNACKS catch her attention. Small wind-up TOYS lie about:  a soldier, a bear banging on a drum, a tractor and car.  A small MUSIC BOX sits on a shelf. She turns the handle, a little TUNE fills the room... \nA cassette sits in the player.  She snaps it shut, hits the play button.  A DRUM BEAT fills the room, followed by a WOMAN'S VOICE, seemingly speaking in a foreign tongue.  The combination is hypnotic and sensual -- she finds herself drawn in ... \nSuddenly Prince grabs her by the waist, lets out a SHRIEK.  She draws a out breath, jumps-- \nVANITY If you think you scared me, you didn't. \nPRINCE Oh, yeah ... \nHe puts his index finger directly in front of her nose, moves it back and forth hypnotically.  She follows it earnestly with her eyes.  Suddenly, he pulls his hand away, stretches it to the ceiling like an escaping bird.  They both smile, lock eyes.  Passion rings in their veins... \nThe Woman's VOICE begins to moan deeply, pleasurably-- \nVANITY Who's the lucky girl?  Sounds like she was having a good time. \nPRINCE She's crying -- it's backwards.  It makes me sad when I hear it.  It sorta sounds like she's laughing, doesn't it? \nVANITY So what did you do to her? Do you always treat your women like that? \nPRINCE I don't have anybody right now. \nHeat floods into her womb like soft fire- \nVANITY You look pretty... \nShe touches his chest delicately, fluffs up his hair-- \nVANITY King Kong? \nPRINCE Stop. \nMorris MOANS dismally-- \nMORRIS Jerome...you think these can be fixed? \nHis shoes are badly scuffed, the leather torn across the top-- \nJEROME I think they're dead, man. \nVANITY God, I'm sorry. \nMORRIS Shit -- it's so rough out here. \nJust then a PATROL CAR cruises by.  The COP regards them suspiciously.  Morris and Jerome snap to attention-- \nMORRIS You lock the door, baby? Let's go! \nThey pile into the Caddy, pull out. \n(51)  EXT. HIGHWAY -- NIGHT \nThe CADDY blazes by in the night.  The CITY LIGHTS glimmer spectacularly in the distance. \n(52)  INT./EXT. CADDY -- NIGHT \nJerome drives.  Morris and Vanity sit in the backseat. He gazes at her ardently-- \nMORRIS Jerome! \nJerome snaps a look in the rear-view -- Morris gives him a deft nod. Jerome opens the glove compartment, searches through the cassette tapes. He finds the one he wants, snaps it into the player. RESTAURANT AMBIANCE fills the car... \nNote:  The restaurant ambiance will grow in volume, and will be followed by exaggerated dinner music, punctuated with strings and delicate cymbals.  The MUSIC plays throughout this scene -- and Morris times his words to the ebb and flow of the piece to insure the proper dramatic effect. \n...dinner MUSIC begins-- \nJEROME Cocktails before dinner? \nMORRIS Yes -- two pi\u00f1a coladas. \nVANITY Uh...make mine a virgin. \nJEROME Okay... \nJerome braces his knees against the wheel, pours two premixed coladas into plastic glasses-- \nJEROME (to Morris) Will you be having a virgin as well? \nMORRIS Ye-es!  For dessert!! Whawhak! \nJerome stifles a laugh, pours a rum miniature into Morris' glass.  He hands them back-- \nMORRIS Thank you.  Here you are, dear. \nThey savor their drinks -- Morris' fervor grows by leaps and bounds-- \nMORRIS Jerome, uh, get your pad and pencil, I think it's gonna be kinda right.  If my judge of character is correct, it's going to be about loving tonight. (a beat) Stop me when I get to seventeen. \nJerome places a pad by his side, pencil at the ready. He settles the Caddy to a cruising 55 -- Morris looks deeply into Vanity's eyes-- \nMORRIS Excuse me, baby...I bet you didn't know I had a piece of this restaurant, did you? (a beat) May I taste that? \nHe takes Vanity's drink, slurps a little, burps-- \nMORRIS Huh, excuse me, that's kind of weak...here, try mine. \nShe does, and begins coughing violently- \nVANITY Good God! \nMORRIS Y'know...they say that saliva is an aphrodisiac. (a beat) You look so lovely tonight. \nVANITY (couching) Why...thank you. \nMORRIS Here...? \nVANITY Yes. \nMORRIS Uh, what one is it? \nVANITY That one, right there, see? On the 14th floor. \nMORRIS It's nice, huh? \nVANITY Oh, it's great.  Real pretty. Big open rooms, balconies, fireplace -- the works. \nHe smiles lovingly-- \nMORRIS Jerome! \nJerome puts the Caddy into gear, pulls off into the night- \nVANITY Hey, wait!  C'mon! (a beat) Okay -- where are you taking me? \nMORRIS Home. (smiling) You and me are a lot alike.- I like that.  So, I'd like to help you out.  I think I have something you may be interested,  in. \nVANITY Oh yeah -- what? \nJerome hands Morris a cassette -- Morris waves it in front of her nose-- \nMORRIS A little song and dance.  That is, if you can sing and dance. \nVANITY (defensively) Prince is goinq to help me. \nJerome and Moris suppress their laughter- \nJEROME Motherfucker needs a haircut. \nMORRIS Hee, hee, uh, excuse me.  No he won't.  He's never done anything in his whole life for anybody but himself. \nVANITY Guys better than you have promised me things before. \nMORRIS I know that's right, but-- \nJerome hands him a card with an address on it.  Morris hands the card to her-- \nMORRIS (con't) -- not Morris Day. (he smiles) \nJerome pulls up in front of her motel. Vanity reads the card-- \nMORRIS Come by any time. \n(53)  EXT. MOTEL/INT. CADDY -- TWILIGHT \nShe gets out of the car, stands on the sidewalk.  Morris pushes the window button -- nothing happens-- \nMORRIS Jerome! \nJerome leans over, taps the glass -- the window glides down-- \nMORRIS (to Vanity) One more thing ... \nJerome snaps the glove compartment, hands Morris a neatly folded camisole. Morris presents it to her-- \nMORRIS Here's a little something for you.  If you get cold when you wear it, call me. \nHe snaps his fingers -- Jerome pulls the Caddy away with a screech. \n(54) EXT. VANITY'S MOTEL -- TWILIGHT \nVanity stands on the sidewalk a moment, slightly bewildered and very amused. She watches the Cadillac screech around the bend.  She turns, goes into the motel. \nPRINCE stands in the alleyway across the street, his motorcycle parked nearby. He watches as Vanity cuts inside. \n(55)  INT. HALLWAY/VANITY'S MOTEL -- DAWN \nVANITY There's a lot of things you don't know about me.  You'd be surprised how many things I could do. \nHe disappears around some trees-- \nVANITY Take me home immediately!  I want to go home.  I can't stand this!  I can't take this anymore!  Prince! \nPRINCE moves through the trees smiling, studying nature-- \nVANITY(O.S.) I don't need this!  I was doing alright before I met you.  Motherfucker, you need a haircut! \nHe comes to a tree, leans against it contentedly, studies the foliage. \nVANITY paces back and forth frantically along the stream-- \nVANITY (to herself) I don't get this. (yells) Prince! Who do you think you are?!  You don't care.  You don't care about anything!  I never wanted you to help me anyway! \nPRINCE rests by the tree, observes TWO HIKERS walking down the path toward him- \nVANITY (0.S.) You think you're a good musician?!  You're nothing! Morris is better.  I never wanted to make it with you anyway. \nThe Hikers pass him startled-- \nPRINCE Good morning. \nVANITY PRINCE, I HATE YOU! \nHIKERS Good morning, sir. \nAnd they walk down the path, disappear around the bend. Just then-- \nVANITY is standing by his side, a wildflower in her hands-- \nVANITY (softly) I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have said those things.  Will you forgive me? \nPRINCE (softly) Yes. \nHe takes the flower, slips it into his jacket, kisses her forehead. \n(60) EXT. GLADE AND BARN -- DAWN \nas they ride down a leaf-strewn path and pull to a stop near an old, weathered, dilapidated BARN.  It stands laarge and silent like a painting.  A low THUNDER rolls across the land... \n(61) INT. BARN -- DAWN \nDAWN LIGHT burns through the wooden slats.. STEAM rises from the wet hay scattered throughout.  The air is thick and damp.  It begins to RAIN. \nVanity stands in the middle of the barn, gazing at the storm.  Beads of perspiration glisten on her forehead. She turns slowly, watches as Prince retrieves old blankets from a nearby stall.  Their eyes search one another out, their breathing becomes short, expectant.  She hesitates a moment, then pulls off her blouse, discards it to the moist, dusty floor. \n(62)  INT. BARN -- DAY \nANOTHER ANGLE RAIN patters srtongly against the barn. A deep THUNDER rolls.  She's on top of him, moving deliciously, her body glowing in the purple, dawn light. Moist, purple water shadows streak and course her skin as she moves slowly, then deliberately against him.  He watches her avidly,  his hands firmly on her thighs, and thrusts into her again and again...and again. \n(62A)  EXT. BARN -- DAY \nLeaves scatter as the bike whips thru the wet path. \n(63) EXT. STREETS, VANITY'S MOTEL -- MORNING \nThe STREETS glisten with the rain. Prince and Vanity pull up in front of her motel.  She hugs him fiercely, steps off the bike, her face alive and fresh as a flower.  His eyes sparkle-- \nPRINCE See you later? \nVANITY When? \nPRINCE Why? \nVANITY 'Cause I have to do something first. \nPRINCE What? \nVANITY (coyly) A secret... \nMORRIS Oh, Lord... \n(68) INT. CLUB (1ST AVE. ST. BAR.) -- DAY \nCU--Clock.  We SEE 11:25 \nPrince cuts through the back entrance, walks onto the floor.  Lisa and Wendy are onstage PLAYING a SONG we immediately recognize as the one they had given Prince to listen to.  The DRUM RIFF is provided by the Linn Machine (a synthesized drum unit).  Wendy plays guitar, her back to Prince.  Lisa, at the keyboards, spots him and stops-- \nWENDY What's wrong? \nLisa points to Prince.  Wendy immediately rips into the guitar solo of \"G-Spot.\"  She stops suddenly-- \nWENDY Is that better? Do you like that? \nHe ignores her-- \nPRINCE Where is everybody? \nLISA You're late -- they left. \nPRINCE So what are you doing here? \nLisa immediately launches into the opening bars of \"Let's Get Crazy\"-- \nLISA (imitating Prince) But I'm here to tell you that there's something else -- our music--. \nThe Girls bust up -- he glares at them-- \nPRINCE Can't you guys get off it? Can't you just leave it alone? \nWendy meets his glare with one of her own... \nWENDY Yeah -- we'll get off it. \nShe turns, snaps off the Linn Machine angrily, plunging the club into silence. \n(69) INT. REHEARSAL HALL --DAY \nThe Time is JAMMING like MAD, deep in the heart of \"Sex Shooter.\"  Brenda and Susan move furiously to the beat, trying their best to get it right.  They are watched by ... \n...Morris, Vanity  and Jerome standing off to the side.  Morris has a contented look on his face, even though his girls are screwing up.  Vanity's eyes are wide with excitement \nMORRIS As you can see, we need someone with your special qualities. \n(70) INT. PRINCE'S ANTECHAMBER AND BEDROOM -- NIGHT \nCU--Clock.  We See: 8:15. \nPrince sits, on his bed, staring at the clock, seemingly lost in thoucht.  He gets up, rummages through his coat pockets, pulls out Lisa's and Wendy's tape.  He snaps it into the player, settles back. \nMUSIC fills the room.  He listens intently a moment, his face placid.  He closes his eyes, tries to relax ... \nSuddenly a DOOR SLAMS in the far reaches of the house.  Harsh FOOTSTEPS echo through the upstairs hallway.  Prince remains still, his eyes closed... \nThen another deathly DOOR SLAM!  GLASS dissolves in its frame and trickles to the floor like icicles.  Resentment surges in him like a tornado.  He rises purposefully, turns the MUSIC up... \n...And then his door SMASHES open and his Mother LUNGES into the room in a PANIC.  She flings herself onto his bed as his Father streaks in and WHACKS! WHACKS!  WHACKS!  at her with a strap, SCREAMING at her with an ominous growl of rage-- \nFATHER You ain't got no business leaving here!  All your sneaking around -- you're just a sinner!  You're nothing but a low life sinner! \nThe Mother throws herself at him drunkenly, starts slapping, scratching at his face-- \nMOTHER Shut up!  You don't care about me!  Leave me alone! \nPrince claws desperately at his Father's back-- \nFATHER Don't I keep the heat on? Isn't there food in the refrigerator? \nMOTHER (crying) I don't like it here.  You never talk to me! I'm always alone! \nPrince drags his Father away-- \nShe outlines the mole on his cheek with a makeup pencil, then draws one on herself.  She takes her earring off, and puts it on his ear.  They are face to face -- identical-- \nMOTHER So pretty... \nShe looks at him drunkenly.  He tries to hold it in, but can't.  A tear, hot and hard as a bullet flows down his cheek. She puts her index finger in front of his face, moves it back and forth hypnotically.   Suddenly she pulls her hand away, stretches it to the ceiling like an escaping bird.  He swallows, tries to smile -- she leans close -- \nMOTHER (secretly) I have to go now, see some friends.  Don't tell your father, okay? \nShe gets up, leaves the room-- \nMOTHER Bye, skipper...bye. \n(71) EXT. PRINCE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT (LATER) \nVanity climbs over a fence, moves through some bushes, emerges along side Prince's house.  She has an excited, ravenous look on her face.  She hurries to the casement window, climbs into the basement. \n(72) INT. PRINCE'S BEDROObt -- NIGHT \nShe drops down into the basement, turns excitedly, leaps into Prince's arms-- \nVANITY I missed you!  Missed you! Missed you! \nShe hugs him tight, showers him with kisses, topples them both to the bed. Laughing, hugging, kissing -- fast and furious.  Suddenly she jumps up like a panther, fluffs her hair wildly in the mirror, fixes him with a wanton look. His eyes devour her-- \nPRINCE Come here.  Where were you? \nShe moistens her lips, walks lasciviously toward the bed, sits facing him.  She laughs suddenly, pushes him back...and they're at each other again - - faces two inches apart;  touching, whispering, kissing, hands searching -- shutting out the rocm, shutting out the world... \nShe jumps up suddenly.  She can't be contained!  She practically levitates-- \nVANITY I have a big surprise for you. \nShe rushes to the coal chute, climbs halfway through.  Prince, puzzled, cracks up watching her ass and legs dangling.  She drops back into the room, holding a large PACKAGE.  His eyes widen.  She struts to the bed, lays it down majestically before him-- \nVANITY (sings) Da...da..! \nPRINCE What is it? \nVANITY Open it. \nHe starts peeling the tape off, careful not to rip the paper.  Vanity's bursting with excitement though, and demolishes it in a flash!  He laughs, opens the lid -- stares in shock-- \nPRINCE Oh, no... (happy) Oh, no! \nHe pulls out a gleaming new GUITAR, and we immediately recognize it as the one they saw in the window. He's deliriously happy, and speechless-- \nPRINCE How'd you do it? \nShe shouts with delight, attacks him again, pushing the guitar aside.  Fast, furious kisses and he responds in kind. They're twisted in a heap on the bed. After a moment they come up for air, stare at each other playfully. Something flashes across his mind-- \nPRINCE Here... \nHer eyes widen.  He takes off his Mother's earring, fastens it to her ear. Eyes dancing, she jumps up, studies it closely, in the mirror-- \nVANITY I love it! \nShe twists around, kneels beside him, showers him with bites and kisses. Suddenly she stops-- \nVANITY I'm going to join Morris' group. \nHis face  drops, shocked-- \nPRINCE What? \nShe backs away from  him, stands, strikes a defensive stance-- \nVANITY I'm going to join Morris' group. \nHe LUNGES savagely before he knows it! His hand lashes out, SMASHES her in the face.  She falls back, CRASHES into the mirror.  She slips dully to the floor, tries desperately to brace herself on a chair-- \nHe's horrified-- \nSuddenly a HORN BLARES off screen. Billy looks up -- a BEAUTIFUL BABE in a black BMW waves-- \nBILLY Go around the block! \nThe Babe pulls into the flow of traffic- \nBILLY It won't be The Time -- they're playing backup to Vanity.  So it's either you or the Modern Aires. (a beat) What would You do in my position? \nPrince has a sinking feeling in his gut- \nBILLY (musing) I like the Modern Aires.  They have a good following -- they show up for practice -- and the kids like all their music. \nThe BMW sweeps up to the curb.  Billy opens the door, slides in-- \nBILLY 'Nough said.  Get smart. Straighten up your shit. \n(76) INT. REHEARSAL HALL -- DAY \nThe PLACE is JUMPING!  Once again The Time is deep in the guts of \"Sex Shooter,\" but now there's a difference. The MUSIC is fiercer and crisper -- the BEAT tailored, more defined. \nMorris and Jerome stand off to the side sporting huge grins.  They're avidly watching... \n...Vanity, Susan, and Brenda dancing up a fierce storm.  Vanity fronts the two Girls and moves panther-like in front of the mirrors... \nShe's a dynamo, her face drawn tightly, her movements crisp and precise.  She urges the Girls on, suggests and cajoles, strengthening their resolve. Sweat lathers their bodies and forms rings on their Danskins.  The act is still very rough, but the potential for success can be felt. \nPRINCE suddenly enters the hall.  Morris spots him immediately and halts the MUSIC.  The Girls dance on a moment, then stop perplexed.  Vanity catches Prince's look, shakes her head in disbelief-- \nPRINCE I want to talk to you. \nShe's out of breath, waves him off-- \nVANITY Not now,  I'm busy. \nPRINCE Now. \nA TITTER goes through the Band Members - - Vanity wipes her face, fixes him with a glare-- \nVANITY I said I'm busy -- we'll talk later. \nPRINCE Uh, uh... \nHe grabs her suddenly, pulls her to the door-- \nVANITY Leave me alone!  I've got a show to do! \nShe pulls away savagely-- \nVANITY YOU can't just come in here and take me away!  We'll talk later! \nMorris is enraged-- \nMORRIS Man -- why don't you just do the walk? \nPrince glares at him, cups his genitals- \nPRINCE Why don't you kiss the one- eyed snake? \nThe Band lets out a condescending GROAN -- the tension rises \nMORRIS Jellybean! \nJellybean, 6'4\", 210 pounds, steps from behind the drums, moves up behind Prince- \nJELLYBEAN Let's go, Jack. \nPRINCE Fuck you! \nHe lunges, grabs Vanity again -- she SHRIEKS-- \nVANITY Leave me alone, dammit!  Get out of here! \nSomething catches his eye -- he stops suddenly.  His Mother stands against the wall, idly watching the goings on.  He jumps off his bike hurriedly, walks up behind her, taps her on the shoulder-- \nPRINCE Ma...? \nShe turns, he gasps out loud.  Her left eye is swollen shut-- \nMOTHER (drunkenly) Hi, ya, baby... \nHer drunken breath washes over him -- his head spins-- \nPRINCE Ma...what happened? \nShe rubs up against him-- \nMOTHER Can you give me some money? C'mon, just some money... \nShe gropes for him drunkenly -- he suddenly realizes she doesn't know who he is-- \nMOTHER Here...here... \nShe tugs at her wedding ring-- \nMOTHER Give me something for this...just a little.  It'll be okay... \nPRINCE C'mon...I'll take you home. \nJust then a COP moves through the Crowd- \nCOP Okay, c'mon now -- break it up.  Let's go.. \nThe Crowd moves out.  Police RADIOS cackle.  Three WOMEN stagger over, one of them grabbing his Mother-- \nWOMAN C'mon, honey -- we're goin' in... \nShe fixes Prince with a glare-- \nWOMAN You're a little young aren't you?  Get out of here.  Leave her alone. \n(79) EXT. PRINCES HOME -- NIGHT \nPrince BLASTS down the STREET, sweeps into his drive, and jumps off his bike, practically smashing it into the gate. His eyes are burning with anger.  He flies up the steps three at a time, cuts across the porch, bursts throuch the front door and-- \n(80) INT. PRINCE'S POME -- NIGHT \n-- stalks through the living room, eyes blazing-- \nPRINCE Where the fuck are you? \nHe spins like a top, streaks down the hallway, throws open several doors violently-- \nPRINCE Where are you? \nHe cuts into the kitchen raging-- \nPRINCE Answer me you fucker!! \nHe twists around frustrated; exhaustion, anger, and pain competing for the same space.  Suddenly he stops, listens intently a moment.  We HEAR it now -- a PIANO.  Someone's PLAYING A PIANO. Prince throws a look at the basement door -- it's ajar. \n(81) INT. BASEMENT, PRINCE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT \nA naked LIGHT BULB snaps ON.  Prince hesitates a moment, descends the steps, pauses at the door.  The MUSIC wafts delicately in the night breeze.  He moves down the halllway uncertainly, but steadily, the MUSIC growing, drawing him in. \nHe stops, peers into the antechamber. His Father is at the piano, his back to him.  He's perched on the broken stool, playing with all he's got. \nPrince moves slowly into the room, his knees weakening, his anger flowing from him with every step he takes.  Seeing his Father this way, he doesn't know if he should laugh or cry.  He sits down silently behind him, listens as his Father plays. \nThe SONG ends.  His Father sits a moment, stretching his hands idly along the keys.  Feeling a presence in the room, he spins around and jumps slightly at seeing his son.  He fixes him with a threatening look, then shrugs, hunches over the keys-- \nPRINCE Is that yours? \nFATHER 'Course it's mine.  Who else's is it goin' to be?  Got all kinds of them.  They're different too. \nJerome busts up-- \nJEROME Oh no... that's cold... \nBut Billy agrees-- \nBILLY The Duke of Dick is in rare form tonight. \nThey all look toward the stage-- \nPRINCE is fastened on Vanity and it's apparent to all.  He launches into the next verse- \nPRINCE She took me to her castle And I could not believe my eyes. She had so many devices Everything that money could buy. She said, Sign your name on the dotted line, The lights went out, And Nicky started to grind. \nVANITY flushes with embarrassment.  Billy and Morris notice this and glare at Prince. \nPRINCE looks dead-center at them, and then to Vanily-- \nPRINCE I woke up the next morning. Nicky wasn't there. I looked all ov'r all I found Was a phone number on the stairs. It said thank you for a funky time, Call me up when ev'r you want to grind. \nVANITY stands suddenly, fighting back tears. She backs from the table quickly, knocks the chair over.  Morris tries to help her, but she sweeps past him, hurrying for the exit. \n(85) INT. STAIRWAY/EXT. STREET -- NIGHT \nas she comes down the stairs stumbling slightly, tears streaming down her face. Chick sees her, reached out to help-- \nCHICK Hey ... \nBut she pulls away, runs out the door, cuts across the street. \n(86) INT. CLUB -- NIGHT \nPRINCE brings the SONG to a blistering end. The stage is plunged into darkness.  He strips off his guitar, cuts from the stage, ignoring the grave looks from his Band Members. \n(87) INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT \nas Prince twists aggressively past a handful of FANS, rudely disregarding their attention.  He Cuts into the dressing room. \n(88) INT. DRESSING ROON -- NIGHT \nHe's agitated, paces back and forth in a frenzy.  Suddenly the DOOR flies open. Billy Sparks enters angrily-- \nBILLY What the fuck's wrong with you, Prince?! \nPRINCE I don't have time for your bullshit, Billy.  What do you want? \nBILLY My stage is no place for your personal shit! \nPRINCE That's life, man. \nBILLY Life my ass, motherfucker! This is a business, and you're not too far gone to see that. (a beat) I've told you this before. You're not pulling them in like you used to.  The only person who gives a fuck about your music is yourself. \nPRINCE Fuck off! \nBut Billy can't help laughing-- \nBILLY Just like your old man... \nPrince shoots him a threatening look-- \nBILLY Yeah -- you got it.  Tell me I'm wrong. (a beat) You're not blind.  Look around you.  No one's digging you. \nPrince turns away-- \nBILLY Look at your band.  Are they in here right now?  They're out there 'cause they can't stand being in the same room with you. (a beat) What a fucking waste...like father, like son-- \nPRINCE Lay off that! \nBilly turns to go-- \nBILLY Take your head out of your ass, Prince, check it out -- unless you like the view up there.  Your music doesn't make sense to anyone but yourself. \n", "test1_input": "PRINCE watches the Girls bowing to thunderous APPLAUSE.  Suddenly Vanity looks at him and touches the earring she's wearing -- it's his Mother's.  His knees weaken instantly, and he locks eyes with her. The heat between them is unmistakable. She smiles vividly, gives him an endearing wave and steps back as the curtain closes. \nHe's MOVING through the Crowd before he knows it, trying to get to the backstage door.  The Crowd is thick, his path momentarily blocked.  He spots Billy Sparks cutting across the floor and congratulating Morris and Jerome. Prince turns from them, tries once again to make his way through the Crowd. \n(94) INT. DRESSING ROOM, AND HALLWAY -- THE TASTE -- NIGHT \nVANITY and the Girls rush into the dressing room and jump up and down with excitement.  They are beside themselves with happiness, kissing and hugging one another avidly.  Suddenly Vanity pulls away, indicates she will be back and cuts out the room. \nHALLWAY as she runs down the hallway to the backstage area, peers from behind the curtain, scanning the club earnestly. \n(95) IN'T. -- THE TASTE -- NEAR CURTAIN -- NIGHT \nas Prince waits impatiently in the long line.  Billy Sparks comes by, spots him and stops-- \nBILLY Morris is squeezing you, kiddo.  You better kick ass tomorrow night or else. \nHe cuts outside, disappears into the Crowd.  Prince stands there steaming, the wind knocked out of him, his joy a memory.  He turns back to the line, but it has grown, the Crowd now jammed up against the door.  Frustrated, he cuts outside. \nBACKSTAGE as Vanity watches Prince leave.  A profound sadness sweeps her face. Suddenly Susan is by her Side, hugging and kissing her happily.  Brenda runs up, pouring champagne.  Morris, Jerome and The Time are at the end of the hallway and beckon her excitedly into the room.  Vanity forces a smile, goes down the hallway, casting another look at the exit door. \n(96) EXT. BACK ALLEY, THE TASTE -- NIGHT \nMorris and Vanity stagger down the ALLEY obviously very drunk.  Morris pulls from a FLASK.  Vanity is still in her lingerie, wears an open coat over it. Her speech is slurred-- \nVANITY Did you hear these people applauding?  They loved us -- they wanted to rip us apart, and this is just our first night.  I can see it now, we're all going to be big stars.  I can feel it. \nMORRIS (singing) Ain't nobody bad like me. \nShe kisses him spontaneously on the cheek-- \nVANITY Morris, you're a genius. \nMORRIS Ye-es... \nHe fixes her with a sexy look, takes a healthy look from his flask, then gives it too her.  Vanity throws her head back, drinks fully, the liquor coursing over her cheeks.  He devours her with his eyes, opens the door to the Caddy-- \nMORRIS Let's go, Bebe. \nShe stops as if remembering something-- \nVANITY Huh, where's Jerome? \nMORRIS In his skin...hee, hee... \nHe's trying to nudge her into the Caddy- \nVANITY Is he coming? \nMORRIS I gave him the night off. \nVANITY Why? \nHe staggers back from the car, undulates his hips wantonly-- \nMORRIS Whawhak! \nShe busts up.  Just then a MOTORCYCLE can be heard off screen.  They look around drunkenly, trying to discern its direction.  Suddenly Prince BLASTS around the corner FULL OUT!  He streaks by Morris and KICKS him flat on his ass into the garbage-- \nMORRIS (wails) Oh, no -- Oh, God...No! \nPrince skids to a slick stop.  Vanity is transfixed.  The entire episode  took less than five seconds.  He twists the throttle, BLASTS down upon her... \nShe breaks in a panic!  She runs clumsily down another alley, her coat flying.  He WHIPS after her like a madman.  She flies around the corner -- a dead end!  He fishtails to a slick stop-- \nPRINCE Get on! \nThere's no way out!  Suddenly she lets out an excited YELP, jumps on.  He guns the bike, BURSTS up the alley.  Morris jumps into his path drunkenly, his arms extended-- \nMORRIS Stop! Stop! \nBut Prince BLAZES down upon him, sending him slipping and sliding to safety.  He BLASTS around the bend-- \n", "test1_true": "(97) EXT. HIGHWAY  TO EMBANKMENT -- NIGHT \nPrince and Vanity WHIPPING down the highway. \n(98) EXT. EMBANKMENT -- NIGHT \nThey streak down the road, slow, then move down a small embankment.  He stops the bike and gets off.  She's in a foul mood, staggers around dully, her head pounding, her speech slurred-- \nVANITY So here we are again.  So this is it, huh?  What do you want this time? \nHe looks at her painfully, upset about her drunken state-- \nVANITY What's your problem now? What's your main problem? \nPRINCE No problem.  I just wanted to talk, alright? I just want us to be okay, to really get along.  No big deal. \nShe cackles, falls flat on her ass, hoists herself up-- \nVANITY No big deal, huh... \nShe pulls Morris' FLASK from her jacket -- his eyes blacken-- \nPRINCE Give me that. \nVANITY No, definitely not.  Who are you?  You can't tell me what to do. \nShe puts it to her lips-- \nPRINCE Please don't drink that.  Give it to me. \nShe holds the flask to her lips defiantly, then goes to drink. \nHe lashes out suddenly, SMASHES it from her grip.  She SCREAMS wildly, SLAPS him hard across the face.  He stands shocked a moment, his rage surging within him, smashing through every safety valve he's acquired in his life.  He BACKHANDS her savagely across the jaw. \nShe hits the ground like a rag doll.  He looks at her curiously, bends over her - - she sucker-punches him with everything she's got!  He SCREAMS in rage and grabs her hands as they flail about his face. He squeezes her fingers back while the tears stream down her cheeks and her mouth forms a silent \"ow\"!  She bares her teeth angrily and he sucks at her mouth, biting and kissing her in a fever pitch. \nShe kicks at him violently, hot tears streaming down her cheeks.  He jams his leg between hers, rubs it firmly against her bottom.  She struggles helplessly against him as he covers her breasts, her stomach, her thighs with his lips. Quick breaths escape from her -- her breathing begins to race... \nHe snaps her panties in two, pulls them from between her legs.  She spreads herself as he releases his pants.  She squeezes his buttocks, pulls him toward her -- but Prince resists her coldly, regards her with contempt.  Suddenly he flips her onto her stomach, forces her to stand painfully on her knees.  He rubs his hand between her buttocks, then thrusts into her painfully, driving himself to the very depths of her... \n...but she stifles a cry, arches her back, and meets his thrusts fiercely, moving quicker and quicker, banging her buttocks against his thighs again and again.  She's drawing from him now, turning the humiliation around, obtaining all that she needs and desires.  He's powerless -- her thrusts set the pace.  She rises, Prince still inside her and tugs on him rapidly, causing him to ejaculate suddenly, drawing from him a sharp and sudden cry... \nShe moves away, draws her coat tightly about her, fixes him with a contemptuous look-- \nVANITY \nYou're nothing, Prince, absolutely nothing.  You think you're so special --  but deep down you're just like all the rest. (a beat) Your whole life you've been hiding, hiding behind your music.  But now you don't even have that, because last night...last night you used it to hurt someone, someone who really cares. \nShe runs up the embankment, wipes away her tears, faces him-- \nVANITY If you put your hands on me like that ever again, I'll be the last person you touch. \nShe pulls off his Mother's earring, throws it at him.  Tears flowing, she streaks into the HIGHWAY blindly, directly into the path of a SPEEDING CAR- \nTHE DRIVER spots her in his HEADLIGHTS, SLAMS on his brakes!  He SKIDS wildly across the road, comes to a SCREECHING, BURNING stop inches from her thigh! \nVANITY shoots a look at Prince, her lips trembling, her love for him, written plainly on her face.  But his eyes flash defiantly.  She bites her lip sadly, then snaps a hot look at the Driver-- \nVANITY I  need a  ride. \nShe cuts around the car, hops in.  The Driver skids off into the night.  Prince stands there trembling, watches as it disappears into the distance. \nDISSOLVE   TO: \n(99) EXT. PRINCE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT \nPrince pulls up to the wooden gate, cuts the motor, gets off.  He walk wearily across the porch, moves to the front door -- it's wide open.  He thinks nothing of it, cuts into the house, closes it behind him. \n(100) INT. PRINCE'S HOUSE -- GROUND  FLOOR -- NIGHT \nHe stands by the door motionless, a curious look on his face.  The STEREO is on, the NEEDLE skipping monotonously along the record.  His mouth opens into a spasm-- \n", "test2_input": "PRINCE Dad...? \nSilence.  A sudden dread courses through him, leaving a hollow in his stomach. His feet are like lead.  He moves heavily into the room-- \nPRINCE Mom...? \nNothing.  Panic sets in.  He STREAKS down the hallway, twists open the bedroom door -- it's empty.  Blue NIGHT LIGHT glows through the windows. CURTAINS play delicately in the breeze. He's thoughtful, walks back into the living room... \n...the COFFEE TABLE is SMASHED.  He looks at it curiously, wondering stupidly if it had always been like that.  Then sudden bolt of fear makes his head swim.  A lamp, a porcelain dish, some knickknacks on the mantle -- all smashed.  He rushes into the kitchen, looks around crazily-- \nPRINCE Daddd...! \nNothing but the decay of his scream. The BASEMENT door is ajar.  He cuts to it quickly, pulls it open, peers frantically into the darkness below.  He snaps ON the light... \n(101) OMIT \n(102) EXT. PRINCE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT \nSIRENS!  The SCENE is a riot of COLOR and FRENZY.  A POLICE CAR, LIGHTS FLASHING, skids into the drive. NEIGHBORS jam the STREETS.  POLICE CARS are parked all around. \n(103) INT. BASEMENT, PRINCE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT \nCHAOS!  The BASEMENT is PACKED with COPS.  Prince's father is strapped into a gurney, staring dully at the ceiling. PHOTOGRAPHERS snap pictures as PARAMEDICS work feverishly over him. I.V. UNITS are pushed into his veins. An OXYGEN MASK is placed over his nose and mouth.  Huge white bandages are bunched up along the back of his head. His Mother is kneeling by the gurney, crying hysterically, grasping his hands in a white panic.  TWO COPS support her. Someone is SHOUTING instructions. RADIOS crackle incessantly.  A MEDIC cries-- \nMEDIC Lift! \nAnd the gurney is hoisted up the stairs quickly, the bulk of the crowd following, his Mother supported as she ascends the stairs. \nPrince sits on a tattered sofa in the corner, his head bowed.  Cops standing and kneeling beside him.  Somebody finished taking notes, closes his pad. One Cop rests a hand on his shoulder, talks to him in soft tones.  Prince shakes his head slightly.  The Cop gives the group a signal and everyone disperses, moves up the stairs.  The Cop looks at him sympathetically, then closes the door behind him. \n(104) INT. BASEMENT -- NIGHT \nPRINCE sits motionless a long time.  Moonlight floods the basement with a foreboding light.  A dog BARKS somewhere in the distance.  He looks up suddenly, his face agitated, his eyes red from tears. \nPRINCE'S POV-- CHALK MARKS on the floor outlining the body of his Father.  There's a GUN in his Father's hand clearly marked. \nA train WHISTLE in the distance.  He's staring at the gun.  He shakes his head, rubs a hand over his face vigorously and looks up again... \n...the GUN in his Father's hand.  He can't get it out of his mind!  The WHISTLE is CLOSER. \nHe lurches to his feet, paces back and forth crazily.  His Father's head, the gun...the gun...the... \nThe WHISTLE is LOUDER. \nHe throws himself into the chair, buries his face deeply into his hands and cries.  Huge racking sobs spasm through his body.  His Father, his Mother, his entire life, his music, his guitar... \nHe looks up suddenly -- the gun in his Father's hand. \n..and he stares at it. \nThe WHISTLE is LOUDER! \nHis heart is pounding in his ears.  He squeezes them shut, looks up... \nThe gun. \nHe bolts to his feet, paces back and forth in a panic!  The train is HOWLING! A rope in the corner of the room, his face, the gun... \nHe sits dully, gazes at the rope as if in a trance.  The TRAIN is ROARING past the house, it's HORN BLASTING.  The rope, the gun, and his body dangling from the rafters in the night breeze-- \nPRINCE (screaming) Noooooo!! \nHe lurches to his feet, cuts through the basement like a madman.  He grabs a stick and starts SLASHING things crazily, moving through the room swinging his stick wildly again and again. \nHe's lost to himself now, deep in the pit of an unknown terror, expurgating a horror that has been festering in him for years.  He flings his stick at the wall, unends shelves and bureaus, trampling old memories that have lain dormant for years. \nDrawer after drawer is flung against the wall, their contents smashing and scattering about.  He opens a large, oaken chest and flips over.  Thick three inch piles of yellowed paper fall out. He snaps through the rubber bands holding them together and flings the paper at the wall again and again... \n...he stops suddenly, shocked.  He SEES musical notes written down on the paper. his heart pounding in his chest, he searches frantically through the rubble scattered about him.  More and more musical notes, sketched ideas, simple melodies, entire songs and scores -- all meticulously recorded on lined yellowed paper, dated for the last 20 years, and signed...by his Father.  He's shocked to a standstill.  Then the full significance of what's before him hits him like a sledgehammer.  He collapses in agony against the chest, tears flowing down his cheeks. \n(105) INT. BASEMENT -- A SERIES OF SHOTS (NIGHT INTO DAY) \n", "test2_true": "ANOTHER ANGLE Cool, gray dawn.  He's in a dead sleep on the floor, his arms outstretched, his legs twisted beneath him.  His Father's outline seemingly rests by his side... \nJust then the basement window begins to glow with SUNLIGHT.  It inches slowly across the floor, then sweeps him majestically, bathing him in its warmth. He wakes slowly, stretches his limbs like an opening flower.  After a moment he sits up, shades his eyes... \nThe basement is littered with debris. The destruction is complete, but in the midst of it lies his Father's music. The yellow parchment is scattered about glowing in the sunlight... \nSomething seems to flash across his mind.  he stands, moves quickly down the hallway to the antechamber... \nSuddenly we HEAR a TAPE REWINDING. After a moment...MUSIC and we immediately recognize it as Lisa's and Wendy's SONG.  It plays a moment, then snaps off abruptly.  He stands locked in thought, then sits behind the piano, hunts for the first few notes of Lisa's and Wendy's song... \nDISSOLVE TO: \n(105A) INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- NIGHT \nPrince's Father is lying on the bed, sleeping peacefully.  A large bandage is wrapped along the back of his head.  His Mother sits by his side, her forehead resting on the covers, her hands holding his.  She's in deep sleep, and it's obvious at once that she's been by his side the entire time... \nPrince steps from the shadows of the room and gazes at them fighting back the emotion that wells within him.  He leans close and kisses them both gentlythen-- \nMC (over) (excited) Let's bring them back!  Ladies and gentlemen, The Time! \n(106)  INT. CLUB  (1ST AVE. ST. BAR) -- NIGHT \nThe CROWD goes WILD!  Morris, Jerome and the Time return to the stage to a frenzied throng.  The PLACE is PACKED, the CROWD applauding like MAD!  LASER LIGHTS strobe the house in a frenzy. It's a glorious night, and Morris struts back and forth imperialistically criss- crossing the stage like a lion, urging the audience on.  He grabs a mike-- \nMORRIS You love us right?!  You want us right?!  I can't hear you! \nThe CROWD is SCREAMING -- Morris flashes a wide, exaggerated grin-- \nMORRIS What time is it?! (a beat) Whawhak!! \nAnd MUSIC.  The Time launches into \"The Bird\" and Morris, laughing heartily, does 'The Bird\" (dance) with Jerome as the audience ROARS their approval. \n(107)  INT. DRESSING ROOM/BACKSTAGE -- NIGHT \nas Prince and his Band sit in grave silence, the exuberant SOUNDS of the CLUB filtering through the open door. Jill is also in the room, sitting on a table, holding the dog silently in her lap.  She casts sidelong looks to Prince, tears welling in her eyes. \nThe Band Members fidget nervously, knowing full well that their jobs are on the line, and feeling awful about the personal tragedy that has befallen Prince.  The entire situation is very tense, and it's made worse every time the crowd lets out a delighted ROAR of approval.  But Prince sits placidly, his face an enigma, his feelings a mystery. \n(108) INT. CLUB -- NIGHT \nAnd it couldn't be more of a contrast! The place is a riot of color and raucous carryings on.  \"The Bird\" is a smashing success with everyone on the dance floor trying gamely to get the steps right. Morris and Jerome are flushed with pride, surprising even themselves with their impromptu adjustments to the act. The MUSIC crescendos, then comes to a rousing blistering end! \nThe stage is plunge into darkness.  the CROWD goes BERSERK.  Billy Sparks shakes his head happily-- \nBILLY Jesus! \n(109)  INT. BACKSTAGE -- NIGHT \nMorris, Jerome and The Time cut briskly past admiring FANS, laughing and shouting crazily-- \nBAND MEMBERS (ad lib) It's all over now.  He better watch out.  He doesn't even need to go on.  He might as well go home. \n(110) INT. DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT \nAs Prince, Jill and the Band sit in dead silence listening to The Time's bluster off screen.  Suddenly The Time crosses the doorway -- Morris does a double- take, sticks his head into the room-- \nMORRIS How's the family!  Whawhak! \nThe Time busts up, drags Morris from the room.  Prince's group is shocked, casts furtive glances to him -- but he remains serene, then-- \nMC (over) Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Prince! \nApplause offscreen.  Prince stands abruptly, straps on his guitar.  His Band Members look at him closely, trying to discern his feelings.  He gives them a cursory glance, cuts out the door. \n(111) INT. CLUB -- NIGHT \nPrince hits the stage and the APPLAUSE grows, but it' s nothing like the exuberance that greeted Morris.  He moves center-stage and plants himself there, his eyes staring into the audience. \nBILLY SPARKS leans against the bar, a smug look on his face. \nVANITY walks slowly up the stairs, gazes at Prince. \n", "test3_input": "PRINCE does not move.  The APPLAUSE trickles away.  He continues to stare in the audience making no attempt to direct his Band, or start a tune.  A nervous TWITTER ripples though the crowd.  Those who know about the tragedy feel a profound embarrassment for him -- but no one turns away.  Then his voice comes clear and mellifluous-- \nPRINCE I would like to do a song that two of my friends wrote. \nA MURMUR, cuts through the Crowd like a riptide.  Prince snaps a look to Lisa and Wendy and confirms that it is indeed their song.  They can't believe it! Tears spring to Wendy's eyes before she knows it ... \nPrince smiles at her, then gazes at his entire Band.  Their eyes fasten on him in an instant.  He counts softly and... \nMUSIC.  The opening bars of \"Purple Rain.\"  He turns to to the audience and SINGS.... \nIt's a ballad, a poem really, a plea for understanding, love, and survival.  It's a testament, a pact if you will, between himself and others... \nThe AUDIENCE is mesmerized, all EYES are upon him -- but Prince doesn't notice. Lips pressed against the mike, dark eyes streaming, he's lost to himself now, loosening all that's within him, cleansing himself of his rage, hatred and pain... \nVANITY is crying.  Every moment she has shared with him is expressed in this song, and the effect on her is unnerving.  Her heart leaps to him in a way she never thought possible.  But she lets it go willingly, as the words draw her in, seducing her somehow, making her free...as if the music, his words, all that he has experienced and  understood, is purging what is confused and ugly within herself, leaving her with an understanding and joy that burns in her womb like soft fire.  A smile springs to her lips as tears continue to flow, and she finds herself moving closer... \n...as the Audience moves closer, drawn somehow to the stage, to the person who SINGS so truly, to the person who gives of himself unselfishly to all that he feels... \nPrince begins a long sustained CRY that cuts though the hearts of all present. The MUSIC builds awsomely, and he continues to sing out, emptying himself of all the remaining pain lying within. The MUSIC crescendos and comes to a quiet end... \nStunned SILENCE.  A silence so profound you could hear a pin drop.  Prince sighs, assumes the worse, then cuts across the stage purposefully.  Now some CLAPPING.  And a WHISTLE from the back and the SHOUTING.  And more WHISTLES and some even SCREAMING.  And the WHISTLES and the SHOUTS and the CLAPPING growing and growing as.... \n(112)  INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT \nPrince cuts from the stage in a frenzy, rushes toward the rear exit.  The APPLAUSE is building and building until it's a THUNDER, an onrushing ROAR, an avalanche of HYSTERIA that rocks the club mightily... \nPRINCE is still running though, his face streaming with tears, past the surprised look of Jill, past the FANS, past everyone -- stripping of his clothes fiercely, flinging off his jacket, his shirt, his scarf-- \n(113) EXT. BACK ENTRANCE, INT. HALLWAY -- CLUB -- NIGHT \nHe SMASHES open the door, BURSTS outside.  He sucks in the night air as if he was drowning.  He wipes away his tears, rushes to his bike, starts to undo the chain... \n...they're SHOUTING his NAME... \nNot randomly, not haphazardly, but...in unison.  And relentless, very demanding, downright urgent, and...it's beautiful. \nA wry smile crosses his lips.  He heads back to the door.  Jill is there, scared, her face a map of tears.  He flashes her a smile-- \nPRINCE Hi. \nShe's thunderstruck, can barely squeak it out-- \nJILL Hi. \nAnd he whips into the hallway.  Her face dissolves into a smile of pure joy. \n(114) INT. CLUB -- NIGHT \nMOVING now, FAST and FURIOUS.  The HALLWAY is LINED with PEOPLE.  They reach for him as he passes, touching him, showering him with their love. Someone hands him his shirt, another his scarf -- it's so intense! \nHe's moving quickly now, his jacket up ahead, closer...he stops suddenly, stunned... \n...Vanity is holding his jacket.  He's struck speechless -- she hands it to him smiling, tears streaming down her face-- \nVANITY I love you. \nHis knees go weak, she kisses him spontaneously, pushes him lovingly to the stage. \nTHE CROWD IS ROARING! \n(115)  INT. HALLWAY AND STAGE REAR -- NIGHT \nHe's half-running now like crazy -- his Band is on-stage, peering anxiously into the hallway.  They spot him and relief sweeps their faces like a tidal wave. He whips his jacket on, rushes up the stairs... \n(116)  INT. CLUB -- NIGHT \nSTAGE THUNDER!  Prince walks center- stage...and bows.  The AUDIENCE goes BERSERK!  He acknowledges Wendy and Lisa, and then the entire Band.  The CROWD is jumping out of their skin!  He straps on his guitar, gives a deft signal and-- \nMUSIC.  The Band launches into \"I Would Die For You.\"  Vanity squeezes her way through the crowd and stands watching Prince from the wings.  He presses his lips to the mike and SINGS. \nThe MUSIC continues as we... \n", "test3_true": "(117)  INT. LIVING ROOM, PRINCE'S HOME -- NIGHT \nPrince walks through the LIVING ROOM slowly, gazes at the smashed table, the broken lamp and dishes. Every item in the room suddenly takes on a profound significance.  His father's slippers under the sofa, his mother's knickknacks on the table, her pen and ink drawings on the wall.  After a moment, he picks up his father's slippers, studies them a long time. \n(118)  INT. BEDROOM -- NIGHT \nThe DOOR opens -- a LIGHT snaps ON.  He walks into the room, places his father's slippers in the CLOSET.  His Mother's dress is lying in a heap on the floor. He picks it up, and puts it away. \n(119) INT. BASEMENT -- NIGHT \nas he descends the steps hesitantly. The FLOOR is covered with rubble.

CLUB -- NIGHT \nPrince on-stage SINGING \"I Would Die For You.\"  The AUDIENCE is captivated, locked into his grip again.  His eyes seem to be focused on something far away.

BASEMENT, PRINCE'S HOME -- TWILIGHT \nHe's in the final stages of cleaning the basement floor.  The debris has been swept up, shelves righted, smashed items thrown away... \nHe stacks his Father's music neatly, tears welling in his eyes.  He places it in new boxes, stands wearily, a fulfilled look on his face.  Suddenly he stops -- stares at the awful chalk marks on the floor:  his Father lying down, the gun gripped in his hand... \n\"I Would Die For You\" continues as we... \nCUT TO: \n(122)  INT. CLUB -- NIGHT \nPrince on-stage SINGING  \"I Would Die For You.\"  He's lost to himself now, locked into a personal horror he alone can see.  The CROWD is pressed against the stage, mesmerized by his performance.  Billy Sparks is also drawn in, amazed at the power being generated from the stage.  Prince sweeps the audience with his eyes, then fastens on Vanity earnestly, SINGS directly to her. \nThe MUSIC continues as we... \nCUT TO: \n(123)  INT. BASEMENT, PRINCE'S HOME -- DAWN \nHe pulls a HOSE from behind the washer, draws it on to the floor.  He hesitates a moment, gazes one last time at his Father's outline, tears welling in his eyes.  He turns the water on, watches as the dusty yellow chalk gives way reluctantly, mixing with the water, swirling down the drain.  Calmness sweeps his face like a passing cloud. \nJust then SUNLIGHT blazes in through the casement windows.  Water droplets glisten brilliantly in the morning light.  He turns the water off, goes to put the hose back -- stops suddenly, surprised... \n...his Mother's earring lies on the floor. \nHe's entranced, picks it up, stares at it a moment.  Everything he's been through comes rushing at him like a loco motive.  The confusion, the shouting and violence, the darkness that eclipsed his parents' life -- it's all there, lying just below the surface, settled into his heart.  But now there's a difference -- he knows it's there and has discovered what could happen when it takes control of your life. \nSo as he stands in the basement, on the clean cellar floor, he realizes that...he'll just take one thing at a time, and do it right.  Better than anybody else.  He smiles, realizes that in the last few weeks, he's never felt better than he feels right now.  He turns quickly, flips the earring to the stairwell... \n...Vanity plucks it from the air.  Their eyes lock and they share smiles of pure joy.  He picks up his father's music, and they both head up the stairs. \n\"I Would Die For You\" continues as we-- \nCUT TO: \n(124)  INT. CLUB -- NIGHT \nCELEBRATION!  Everyone is JUMPING up and down.  Prince is radiant, strutting across the stage, his hands upraised. The CROWD goes WILD!  He flashes a wide grin to Vanity, then twists, eyeballs the CROWD wickedly, wonderfully.  It's too much! \nEveryone is joining in now.  Even Morris and Jerome, standing in the wings, start DANCING like crazy.  Then suddenly they catch themselves, stop, act dignified. But Vanity sees them and busts up.  They catch her look, laugh heartily and join in again. \nThe MUSIC segues into a fierce BEAT. The CROWD lets out a ROAR!  Prince strips off his guitar, streaks center- stage.  The Band launches into \"Baby, I'm A Star.\" \n...And the CROWD laughing, dancing, shouting and loving.

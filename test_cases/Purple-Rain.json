{"test1_input": "JEROME (smiles) Ye-es. \n(33) INT.  DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT \nPrince and his band (Mark, Bobby, Matt, Lisa) sit backstage, waiting to go on. An air of tension permeates the room. Lisa sits in the corner and fidgets, casts sidelong looks to Prince.  He sits apart from the group, deathly silent, locked in thouqht. \nWendy walks in and shares a look with Lisa.  She goes up to Prince, her voice filled with nervousness-- \nWENDY Hi  ya, Prince.  I heard through the grapevine you had a new tune written by two great girls.  By chance did you hear it? \nHe stares at her -- if looks could kill Wendy would be dead-- \nLISA I knew it -- he didn't listen to it.  He probably dropped it under his bike and rolled over it. \nPrince grunts, turns away -- Wendy is amazed-- \nWENDY Wow! Okay...you think about this.  I'm going to be real honest with you.  You're really being full of shit. \nLISA Forget about it, Wendy.  Let's get out of here-- \nBut Wendy, agitated, silences her with a fierce gesture-- \nWENDY (to Prince) Every time we give you a song, you say you're going to use it, but you never do.  You always think that we're doing something behind your back. You're just being paranoid as usual. \nLISA Wendy... \nWENDY (upset) Shut up, Lisa, please! (to Prince) You should know by now that we wouldn't hurt vou.  We're not out to put a dark cloud over your head.  It's just to make you feel good, Prince -- that's what it's all about. You've been this way with us before, remember? \nPRINCE (maliciously) The nominees for the best actress are-- \nLISA -- Fuck it, Wendy -- let's break! \nWendy is shaking, tears spring to her eyes-- \nWENDY Do you know you can really, really hurt people?  Doesn't that mean anything to you? Doesn't that make you feel like shit? \nLISA C'mon ... \nWENDY I'm tired of this ... I'm really tired... \nThey leave the room, Wendy SLAMS the door behind her.  Prince casts a look to Bobby, Mark, Matt-- \nPRINCE You tired, too? \nMATT God got Wendy's periods reversed.  About every 28 days, she starts acting nice. Lasts about a weekend. \nThud.  The joke hangs suspended like a ball and chain.  Bobby gets up, the others follow him to the door-- \nBOBBY What difference does it make, Prince.  We're still a group, right? \nThey cut out the door. \n(34) INT.  HALLWAY -- NIGHT \nBobby, Matt and Mark move briskly to the stage-- \nMARK Headcase.  Telling you...'effed up headcase. \nBOBBY People with talent usually are. \nMatt dons his surgeon's mask -- Mark rolls his eyes-- \nMARK Of course, there are a number of headcases without great talent too. \n(35) INT/BACKSTAGE ENTRANCE/CLUB -- NIGHT \nMorris stands by the door surrounded by several delicious BABES.  One of them, wearing a tight, red dress, looks especially enticing.  Morris leans in closer -- her tasty breasts strain against the spandex material-- \nMORRIS Honey -- don't you ever try and breastfeed no baby now. \nGIRL Why not? \n", "test1_true": "Jerome appears-- \nJEROME What. \nMORRIS What? \nJEROME Right.  What. \nMORRIS What?? \nJEROME You got it. \nBe snaps his head to the side -- Morris looks, sees Vanity sitting at a table. His eyes dance mischievously-- \nMORRIS Ye-es (to Girl) What time is it? \nGIRL (coyly) Tea time. \nMORRIS So, right. \n(36) INT. DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT \nas Prince sits by himself in front of the mirror, staring at a cassette on the counter.  We recognize it immediately as the tape Jill gave him earlier, containing Lisa's and Wendy's music.  He picks it up, snaps it into a ghetto blaster.  MUSIC, without lyrics, fills the room.  He adjusts the dials, sits back and listens a moment.  Suddenly the door opens-- \nSTAGEHAND Prince, five minutes. \nBe snaps off the music, drops the cassette into his pocket, cuts out the room. \n(37) INT.  BACKSTAGE -- NIGHT \nHe comes to the stage-area.  His Band.Members are standing about anxiously, watching the final moments of The Modern Aires' performance.  He cuts behind the curtain, peers at the crowd... \n...his eyes fall on Vanity -- his face brightens instantly.  Just then Jerome and Morris approach her.  Prince shakes his head knowingly, offers a wry smile, then joins his band. \n(38) INT.  VAN1TY'S TABLE AND CLUB -- NIGHT \nShe sits demurely.  Morris' eyes are wide and shining -- her beauty up close astonishes him-- \nJEROME Vanity, I'd like you to meet Morris E. Day. \nMORRIS Hold it now -- just leave the 'E' alone. \nJEROME (clears throat) Vanity...this is Morris Day \nMORRIS The pleasure's all mine. \nshe offers her hand -- he takes it decorously-- \nJEROME If you'd excuse me. \nMorris signals him -- whispers into his ear-- \nMORRIS Too sexy ... (a beat) Have  a waitress bring.a bottle of their best champacne. \nHe seats himself, fastens her with a sexy, half-lidded look-- \nMORRIS Your lips would make a lollipop too happy. \nVANITY You think so, huh? \nMORRIS Ye-es. \nKim appears with a bottle of champacne in ice-- \nKIM Who's paying for this Morris? \nMORRIS I think you know that. (a beat) Jerome! \nJerome appears, opens the bottle with a flair, performs a classy taste test. Morris pulls out some cash, pays him, who snatches the money, leaves-- \nMORRIS Huh, keep the change-- \n", "test1_id": 1257, "test2_input": "He whispers to Jerome-- \nMORRIS Get my change, will ya? \nJerome leaves, Morris purses his lips-- \nMORRIS Oh, Lord...either somebody put something in my drink, or you are the finest (motherfucker) I've seen in ages. \nVANITY Excuse me, what did you say? \nMORRIS Huh...you look nice tonight. \nHe leans in, speaks with a sexy voice-- \nMORRIS It's rare that I out my cards on the table when it comes to meeting younq ladies, but ... I'm going to make you love me. \nVANITY Is that a  fact? \nHe folds his legs dramatically, his Stacy Adams reflecting the light-- \nMORRIS Just as sure as my Stacy Adams are shiny. \nJust then-- \nM.C. (O.S.) Ladies and Gentlemen -- please welcome Prince! \nThe CLUB erupts in CRIES!  Prince hits the stage, launches into \"G-spot,\" a fast, high-spirited funk tune that gets the crowd hopping.  Vanity watches as Prince whips the crowd into a frenzy. Morris listens with a complacent grin on his face, his eyes searching out various members of The Time who are scattered through-out the club.  When he connects with one of them he makes a series of absurd faces which sends them into hysterics.  For Prince is playing music that The Time is noted for, and, as far as Morris is concerned, performs better. Not everyone in the club is dancing, or paying attention, and this does not escape his notice. \nSuddenly \"G-Spot\" comes to a rousing end.  The CROWD cheers wildly.  Prince moves quickly to the piano and launches into \"Electric Intercourse,\" a love ballad which, as it progresses, becomes a personal statement for Vanity and Prince himself. \nShe listens intently, her eyes fastened on him.  The words have a profound effect on her -- and the audience. Without being consciously aware of it, they're moving closer to the stage, searching for their personal fix. Prince surrenders himself to the music totally, releasing from himself all that is hurtful -- releasing the sincerity and truthfulness that escapes him in his daily life.  We are entering  realm where life and music are inextricably bound, and the impact on the performer and listener is profound. \nHe's directing his music toward her, and she receives it gratefully, almost anxiously.  It fills a void in her, hewn by a life of meaningless promises.  He searches her face with his magnificent eyes, and ends the song with a heartrending cry which connects with the souls of all present.  Everyone is paying attention now. \nThe stage is plunged into darkness.  The CROWD goes CRAZY!  Vanity applauds vigorously, wipes the tears from her eyes.  Morris, who was more affected by the performance than he'd care to admit, doesn't like what he sees and searches for a winning line-- \nMORRIS He doesn't like girls. \nShe's equal to the challenge-- \nVANITY I know -- he likes women. \nBut Morris can barely suppress a smile, and settles himself comfortably into his chair -- for he knows what Vanity has lost...at least this round-- \nMORRIS Well ... he don't do too good with them either. \nShe flashes him a quizzical look -- he simply smiles. \n(39) INT.  BACKSTAGE HALLIIAY -- NIGHT \nJubilation time!  Prince and his Band move through the hallway briskly, past the outstretched arms of admiring fans. There's a lot of back-slapping going on as the Musicians bask in the glow of well-wishers.  Prince moves past Billy Sparks, who has an angry look on his face-- \nBILLY What's this intercourse, shit? \nPRINCE Hey; man -- don't worry about it. \nBILLY I'm warning you... \nBut Prince ignores him, cuts into the dressing room-- \n(40) INT.  DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT \n--then stops suddenly, surprised.  He's muzzle to muzzle with a cuddly DOG, held up lovingly by Jill-- \nJILL Surprise! \nOOHS! and AAHS!  by  the entire group. Jill hesitates, then kisses Prince's cheek compulsively.  He's surprised, touched-- \nPRINCE Hey -- wait till we're married, now. \nShe fidgets, her face blushes red. Wendy is studying the dog-- \n", "test2_true": "Everyone looks -- Jill grins like the Cheshire Cat-- \nJILL Notice anything? \nPRINCE What? \nWENDY It looks like you! \nShe thrusts the dog into his arms -- the Band laughs uproariously.  Jill is beaming-- \nJILL His hair ... \nPrince gazes into the mirror -- and sure enough the dog's hair has been groomed to match his.  He can't help smiling-- \nPRINCE Shit ... \nJILL (softly) I wanted to cheer you up. \nPRINCE Thanks. \nMATT I'm hungry -- where's the food?! \nHe grabs the dog, 'a la The Werewolf, starts chomping on it's neck.  The Group busts up, starts fooling around. \nPrince glances into the mirror -- Vanity is there.  He whirls around to the door -- nothing.  A huge smile sweeps his face instead.  The Band continues fooling around, and Prince joins in with a relish. \n(41) EXT.  ALLEYWAY #2, REAR CLUB -- NIGHT \nVanity leans against a brick wall, hiding in the shadows.  Suddenly FOOTSTEPS approach.  Prince appears, gets on his Motorcycle-- \nVANITY Hey... \nHe doesn't look up-- \nPRINCE We have to go to your place. \nVANITY What for? \nPRINCE I want to show you something. \nShe's embarrassed by her apartment-- \nVANITY No...no, we can't. \nPRINCE Why -- is there someone there? \nVANITY Why do you always think there's somebody else? \nHe averts his eyes -- kick STARTS his bike-- \nPRINCE Let's go. \nVANITY (Getting on) Yeah -- but we're not going to my place. \nHe remains silent, snaps the bike into gear, blasts down the ally into the street. \n(42) PRINCE'S HOUSE AND STREET -- NIGHT \nPrince and Vanity whip down a residential street.  As he approaches his house he slows, moves past it quietly. \nHe makes a deft U-turn, crosses his house again -- seems to be listening intently... \nAfter a moment, he cuts down a narrow path, turns up a back alley.  He rides to a wooden gate, detaches a hidden lever.  The wood slats rotate like a garage door -- Prince coaxes his bike through. \nBACKYARD \nVanity's mesmerized.  They ride down a narrow sidewalk, cut through a garden, and emerge from the back of a garage. He leans his bike against it-- \nVANITY That was a grand entrance. Where am I? \nHe silences her with a look, moves quickly across the grass, comes to a window.  He stands on a pipe, looks in-- \n", "test2_id": 1258, "test3_input": "MORRIS Here...? \nVANITY Yes. \nMORRIS Uh, what one is it? \nVANITY That one, right there, see? On the 14th floor. \nMORRIS It's nice, huh? \nVANITY Oh, it's great.  Real pretty. Big open rooms, balconies, fireplace -- the works. \nHe smiles lovingly-- \nMORRIS Jerome! \nJerome puts the Caddy into gear, pulls off into the night- \nVANITY Hey, wait!  C'mon! (a beat) Okay -- where are you taking me? \nMORRIS Home. (smiling) You and me are a lot alike.- I like that.  So, I'd like to help you out.  I think I have something you may be interested,  in. \nVANITY Oh yeah -- what? \nJerome hands Morris a cassette -- Morris waves it in front of her nose-- \nMORRIS A little song and dance.  That is, if you can sing and dance. \nVANITY (defensively) Prince is goinq to help me. \nJerome and Moris suppress their laughter- \nJEROME Motherfucker needs a haircut. \nMORRIS Hee, hee, uh, excuse me.  No he won't.  He's never done anything in his whole life for anybody but himself. \nVANITY Guys better than you have promised me things before. \nMORRIS I know that's right, but-- \nJerome hands him a card with an address on it.  Morris hands the card to her-- \nMORRIS (con't) -- not Morris Day. (he smiles) \nJerome pulls up in front of her motel. Vanity reads the card-- \nMORRIS Come by any time. \n(53)  EXT. MOTEL/INT. CADDY -- TWILIGHT \nShe gets out of the car, stands on the sidewalk.  Morris pushes the window button -- nothing happens-- \nMORRIS Jerome! \nJerome leans over, taps the glass -- the window glides down-- \nMORRIS (to Vanity) One more thing ... \nJerome snaps the glove compartment, hands Morris a neatly folded camisole. Morris presents it to her-- \nMORRIS Here's a little something for you.  If you get cold when you wear it, call me. \nHe snaps his fingers -- Jerome pulls the Caddy away with a screech. \n(54) EXT. VANITY'S MOTEL -- TWILIGHT \nVanity stands on the sidewalk a moment, slightly bewildered and very amused. She watches the Cadillac screech around the bend.  She turns, goes into the motel. \nPRINCE stands in the alleyway across the street, his motorcycle parked nearby. He watches as Vanity cuts inside. \n(55)  INT. HALLWAY/VANITY'S MOTEL -- DAWN \n", "test3_true": "(55A)  INT. VANITY'S ROOM -- DAWN \nShe goes inside, drops the tape and card in her bureau. unfolding the camisole, she holds it against her, gazes into the mirror.  It looks beautiful.  Suddenly a KNOCK at the door-- \nVANITY Morris...? \nAnother two KNOCKS, something like a confirmation.  She smiles, cuts to the door, flings it open -- but Prince is there. She's shocked, but recovers instantly-- \nVANITY I had a feeling it was you -- I knew it!  It's amazing -- I could tell it was you. \nHis face remains placid as he puts on his sunglasses-- \nPRINCE How'd you get home? \nVANITY Took a cab. \nPRINCE Oh yeah?  Where'd you get that? \nShe stares at the camisole in her hands- \nVANITY I adore camisoles. \nHe nods dispassionately, walks into the room, gives the place the once over, then-- \nPRINCE Let's ride. \n(56)  EXT. HIGHWAY -- DAWN \nAERIAL SHOT Prince and Vanity on his motorcycle whipping down the highway.  The DAWN LIGHT breaks over the horizon. \n(57) EXT. ANOTHER HIGHWAY -- DAWN \nA SERIES OF SHOTS Streaking down a two-lane blacktop obviously exhilarated by the velocity of their ride.  The landscape becomes lush, the trees a riot of autumn splendor. \n(58) EXT. COUNTRY ROAD -- DAWN \nANOTHER ANGLE as Prince and Vanity whip up to the top of a small hill, skid to a stop.  He scans the area quickly, gets his bearings.  He pops the clutch, skids off to the valley below. \n(59) EXT. WOODS AND STREAM -- DAWN \nPRINCE AND VANITY ride cautiously through a series of hiking paths, then twist down a small embankment.  A STREAM flows before them.  They climb off the bike, look around quietly-- \nVANITY God, this is beautiful.  It reminds me of where I grew up. My father used to ... \nHe waits for an answer, it's not forthcoming-- \nPRINCE Your father used to what...? \nVANITY Nothing...it's just... (changes subject) You must like places like this. \nHe goes to the stream, balances on several rocks, moves to the other side. The stream flows between them-- \nVANITY So, have you reconsidered my proposal? \nPRINCE What...? \nVANITY What we talked about last time. \nPRINCE You can't be serious. \nShe starts a little dance step, climaxes it with spins and twirls-- \nVANITY Oh, come on -- you know you really want to.  You've been waiting for this opportunity ...all...your...life... \nHe can't help laughing -- she freezes, looks at him coldly-- \nPRINCE I'm sorry -- excuse me. \nVANITY God -- so why do you come around?  You don't want to help me, not that you have to. You don't want to sleep with me, not that you have to do that either.  So why am I here? \nHe smiles, walks off-- \n", "test3_id": 1259}

JOEL Yeah... I'm beginning to think I might be the same way... I'm a little worried about what I'd do with too much time on my hands. 
STEP I just lay around and watch TV all day. 
JOEL Yeah,... I think I do a lot worse. 
STEP The problem is, if I bankrupt the company, there won't be a job to go back to. 
JOEL You don't have to bankrupt the company. 
STEP Yeah, but then if I drop the lawsuit, you'll sell the company, and the new company might not hire me. 
JOEL Well, maybe I don't have to sell the company... You know I've been thinking; all these years I've been building this company, dreaming about the day I could sell it and retire, but what would I really do if I retired? It's like that old saying -- it's not about the destination, it's about the journey? Step just stares at him blankly, he lost him. 
JOEL I guess what I'm saying is, too much free time might not be such a good thing -- like that old saying, idle hands are the Devil's playground? Step's never heard that one either. 
STEP I'm sorry, I don't do much book readin'. 
JOEL What I'm saying is, I'm thinking maybe I won't sell the company... 
STEP Really? 
JOEL that is, if you dropped the lawsuit. -- and remember, you'll still get that insurance money -- probably a couple hundred thousand. What do you think? 
STEP Hmm. That sounds fair... But under one condition... 
JOEL What's that? 
STEP You make me floor manager. 
JOEL Deal. They shake hands. 
INT. REYNOLDS EXTRACT - MANUFACTURING AREA 
Joel walks in with Step at his side. Addresses the employees. 
JOEL Hold the line! Mary shuts off the conveyer belt. 
JOEL Okay, listen up everybody. (Waits for them to settle) I've decided not to sell the company... Gasps and murmurs among the employees. 
JOEL And I'm making Step the new Floor Manager. More gasps and murmurs. 
JOEL And if anyone doesn't like it, I hear they're hiring over at Gemco... But just remember, at Gemco, the owner doesn't know your names; you never even meet him, he's at an office up in Chicago somewhere and you get an auto- response if you try to email him to complain about anything. Here, you can come up to my office any time you have a problem. Thanks. Joel walks off. Brian catches up with him. 
BRIAN Huh? You're not selling? 
JOEL It's about the journey Brian. The journey. ANGLE on Mary. She and Gabrielle start right back up. 
MARY You know, if Joel's going to put him in charge, we should go on strike. You know, at Gemco, the union handles the strikes and you don't even have to-- PULL OUT as Step cuts her off. 
STEP Quit yapping and get back to work or you're fired. Step walks off -- maybe pops a testosterone pill. Mary and Gabrielle keep muttering and shaking their heads. LONG PULL OUT as things get back to normal at the factory. 
INT. CHAPEL - DAY 
We are CLOSE ON NATHAN, in a coffin, embalmed. We PULL OUT to see mourners lined up, taking a last look at the body. Joel is among them. He looks down at Nathan for a moment and then continues to his seat. A few rows back, we see SUZIE, sitting by herself, dressed in black. 
EXT. CEMETERY - DAY 
Quick shot of Nathan's casket being lowered into the ground as the priest says the last few words.

Wilkins talks to Rhodes over the radio. 
WILKINS Watch your needles! 
EXT. GHOST CRASH SITE 
Rhodes walks up to his men who are in the process of opening the bomb bay doors manually. The doors are open a foot. Rhodes signals his men to stop. Rhodes steps up, shines a light into the bomb bays. 
INSIDE BOMB BAYS Rhodes' light plays over the bomb racks -- empty. 
RHODES (into headset mike) Colonel? (takes breath) We've got ourselves a Broken Arrow. 
INT.PENTAGON - SITUATION ROOM 
Stunned silence. They've just gotten the news. Baird doesn't know what it means. 
BAIRD Broken Arrow? 
CHAIRMAN That's what we call it when we lose a nuclear weapon. 
BAIRD Oh, Jesus. (thinks, shakes head) I don't know what's scarier -- losing nuclear weapons or the fact that it happens so often that you people have a term for it. 
INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER 
Wilkins is on the radio with Rhodes. 
WILKINS Find the nukes, Sam. But be careful. I know they say those eggs can't be cracked, but if your geigers pick up more rads than you'd get off a toaster, I want you out of there. Wilkins to the CORPORAL. 
WILKINS Get the teams in. I want Colonel Rhodes and his men backed up. 
INT. PENTAGON SITUATION ROOM 
CU COMPUTER SCREEN Various views of a B-83 nuclear weapon. Creeley is briefing Baird on the nukes. 
BAIRD They dropped from a plane but they didn't go off...? 
CREELEY They have to be armed to detonate. 
BAIRD Then they're destroyed? 
CREELEY (shakes head) They're designed to survive crashes intact. They can lie in a pool of burning jet fuel for five hours without any problem. 
BAIRD How did this happen? 
CREELEY In his last transmission, Colonel Deakins said Major Hale lost control. He probably hit weapons release by accident. Believe me, when a plane's auguring in, you start pushing every button you can. Baird stands, looks at a picture of a Ghost shakes his head. 
BAIRD Hell, we should take the cost of the plane out of major Hale's salary. Although I guess at two billion dollars a pop, that could take a while. 
EXT. CANYONLANDS - DAWN 
Hale is still unconscious, lying beside his parachute. There's the crunch of footsteps and a FIGURE looms over Hale. The figure reaches down to touch Hale's shoulder and... 
HALE Spins, grabs the shirt of the figure and cocks his arm about to punch. He hesitates when he sees it's... 
TERRY She seizes Hale's hesitation and punches him hard. 
HALE AND TERRY Hale is stunned. Terry starts to get up, reaching for her gun. Hale strikes out with a leg, getting Terry in the gut, sending her back. She hits the ground, still struggling for her gun. Hale gets up, runs, sprinting off over the rocky terrain. 
HIS POV Jarring, racing over rock and then... 
HALE Pulls up fast, almost not fast enough. 
HALE'S POV He's stopped right at the edge of a fifty foot drop. 
TERRY (O.S.) That would be the wrong way. 
TERRY Is walking slowly, calmy, up behind Hale, pistol out.

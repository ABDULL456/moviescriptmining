Kyle, Percy, Sandra and Audrey frantically carry Howard, his neck bandaged, to the back of the Escalade. 
INT. ESCALADE - CONTINUOUS 
Howard lies in the back seat. Sandra by his head, clasping his hands in hers. Audrey by his feet. Percy rides shotgun. Kyle struggles to get the key in the ignition. The engine ROARS to life. 
EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS 
The Escalade fishtails onto the highway. 
INT. ESCALADE - CONTINUOUS 
Kyle grips the wheel.   Picking up speed. 
KYLE How far to the hospital? 
PERCY Seventy, maybe eighty miles. Kyle shoots him a look. Eighty miles?! Pedal to the floor time. Audrey leans forward from the back seat. 
AUDREY What's that on the road? Up ahead, the DARK CLOUDS Jeep saw earlier have finally closed in, descending onto the highway like a WALL. 
KYLE They're fuckin' clouds!   What the fuck do they look like? 
AUDREY Not clouds. Clouds don't buzz. She's right.    They're black... Undulating... BUZZING! 
PING!   PING!   PING! Suddenly HUNDREDS OF TINY BUGS begin to HIT the windshield -- 
SPLAT! And that's when they realize it... Those aren't clouds. 
THEY'RE FLIES! The Escalade enters the SWARM. The car is PUMMELED by insects, the windshield instantly covered in BLACK AND RED bug guts. Driving blind! The sound of FLIES SPLATTERING and BUZZING is deafening! Everyone SCREAMS as hell surrounds them... 
INT. DINER BATHROOM - SAME 
Bob is hunched over the steaming sink, pounding a can of light beer. Jeep is leaning against the wall, looking like he's about to puke or faint. 
BOB I don't understand how she was still standin' after Percy hit `er with that goddamn fryin' pan. Broke her fuckin' neck. I saw it. I swear I did. 
(BEAT) And did you see that kid's gun? The hell's he doin' with a gun like that? Bob looks over at Jeep, sees him trembling. 
BOB It's okay, Jeep.   It's okay. But for Jeep it's not okay.   He's hurting real bad inside. 
JEEP I couldn't pull the trigger. I froze. I saw what I needed to do, but I was afraid... (breaks down) She could've killed you! 
(MORE) 
JEEP (cont'd) Or Charlie...She would've killed me if it wasn't for... He can't get the words out.   Bob rests a hand on his boy's shoulder. 
BOB There's nothin' to be ashamed of, Jeep. 
(BEAT) Not everybody can play the hero. Before Jeep can respond, they hear the sound of the front 
DOOR JINGLE.

CALVIN CANDIE 
(TO SCHULTZ) Rhubarb pie? Schultz looks at the pie and the man. Dr.SCHULTZ No. 
CALVIN CANDIE Are you brooding 'bout me getting the best of ya? Dr.SCHULTZ Actually, I was thinking of that poor devil you fed to the dogs today, D'Artagnan. And I was wondering what Dumas would make of all this. Calvin hands the doctor the two pieces of paper he needs. Broomhilda's bill of sale, and her freedom papers. As he says the following he examines he papers. 
CALVIN CANDIE Dumas...? Dr.SCHULTZ Alexander Dumas. He wrote "The Three Musketeers." I figured you must be an admirer. You named your slave after that novel's lead character. If Alexander Dumas had been there today, I wonder what he would of made of it? 
CALVIN CANDIE You doubt he'd approve? Dr.SCHULTZ Yes his approval would be a dubious proposition at best. 
CALVIN CANDIE Soft hearted Frenchy? Dr.SCHULTZ Alexander Dumas is black. 
Schultz rises, puts the papers in his back pocket, .looks to his two companions, Django and Broomhilda, and says; Dr.SCHULTZ We got it, let's go. 
(TO CANDIE) Normally Monsieur Candie, I would say, auf wiedersehen. But since what auf wiedersehen actually means is, till I see you again, and since I never wish to see you again, to you sir, I say, goodbye. Schultz begins to cross the room towards the exit. When Calvin says to the German's back; 
CALVIN CANDIE One more moment, Doc! Dr.SCHULTZ What? 
CALVIN CANDIE It's a custom here in the South, once a business deal is concluded, for the two parties to shake hands. It implies good faith. Dr.SCHULTZ I'm not from the South. He turns to leave. 
CALVIN CANDIE You're in my house, doctor, I'm afraid I must insist. This turns Schultz around. Dr.SCHULTZ Insist what...? That I shake your hand before I leave? Then I'm afraid I must insist in the opposite direction. Calvin walks closer to the German doctor. 
CALVIN CANDIE You know what I think you are? Dr.SCHULTZ What you think I am? No I don't. 
CALVIN CANDLE I think you are a bad loser. Dr.SCHULTZ And I think you're an abysmal winner. 
CALVIN CANDLE Never the less, here in Chickasaw County a deal ain't done till the two parties have shook hands. Even after all this paper signin', don't mean shit you don't shake my hand. Dr.SCHULTZ If I don't shake your hand, you're gonna throw away twelve thousand dollars...? I don't think so. Schultz looks to Django and Broomhilda. Dr.SCHULTZ Let's go. 
CALVIN CANDIE Bartholomew, if she tries to leave here before this German shakes my hand. Cut 'er down. Schultz looks to Django... . then to Candle.. .and then with a smile on his face, and a twinkle in his eye, asks 
CANDLE; Dr.SCHULTZ. You really want me to shake your hand? Django gets it. 
CALVIN CANDIE I insist. 
DR -Schultz smiles. Dr.SCHULTZ Well, if you insist. Django goes to stop him... 
The German crosses toward Candie, offering him his hand... Candie offers his hand to Schultz... The small DERRINGER POPS into Schultz's outstretched hand... 
POP! He SHOOTS CALVIN CANDIE in the heart. Candie has a look of shock as blood explodes from his heart, and he falls to the floor. Everybody is stunned. Schultz looks to Django. Django looks back. Dr.SCHULTZ 
(TO DJANGO) I'm sorry. I couldn't resist. Dr.SCHULTZ is BLOWN APART by Bartholomew's SAWED OFF SHOTGUN. The room comes to its senses and attacks Django and Broomhilda. 
FADE TO BLACK 
We FADE UP FROM BLACK to see: The soles of Django's bare feet. A rope is tied around the ankles, and it's obvious he's been strung up, upside down. The CAMERA moves down his naked body, down his legs (we see his wrists are'bound with ropes to his thigh), down his bare buttocks, down his whip scarred back, to the back of his head which hovers just about three inches from the barn yard wooden floor. 
INT - BARN - AFTERNOON Eight year old stable boy, Timmy, wipes the unconscious Django's face with a wet rag. They are all alone in the barn. Django begins to come to ... 
TIMMY 
(SHHH'S HIM) Act like you still sleepin'. 
DJANGO Where's Broomhilda? 
TIMMY Who? 
DJANGO Hildi, the slave girl that ran away a couple of days ago. They had her in The Hot Box. 
TIMMY I don't know 'bout no girl. 
DJANGO How 'bout that German white man I came here with? 
TIMMY Oh he's dead. His body's over there. Django twists upside down on the rope, and sees the corpse of his friend King Schultz dead on the filthy barn yard floor. The sight of the lifeless carcass of the doctor fills Django with pain and anger. Just then head overseer Ace Woody walks in the barn. Upon seeing Ace, Timmy hightails it out of there, Ace throws an empty bucket at the fleeing boy. 
ACE WOODY Git on outta here, boy! 
Django, slightly..swaying to and fro from the rope, looks upside down at Ace Woody, all dressed up in a black suit with a string tie, which makes him look a bit like Wyatt Earp. 
ACE WOODY So y'all bounty hunters,.huh? Django thinks, "How does he know?" 
ACE WOODY I knew there was something fishy 'bout, y'all. We found your wanted posters and book of figures in your saddle bags. I gotta say, ain't never heard of no black bounty hunter before. A black boy paid to kill white men? How did ya like that line of work? Django retorts, upside down.

He leans over, kisses her gently.  But Susan seems hardly reassured.

INT. MANNY'S APARTMENT - PREDAWN 
The blue hours before dawn. Laconic movement outside.  New York dragging itself out of bed. 
We FIND Manny fixing some melted cheese sandwiches on a hot plate. He addresses Chuy's tented bed behind him. 
MANNY My father saw me stay in bed, he'd go get a pitcher. Cold water, whoosh, I tell you that's some alarm clock, brrrrr! 
Manny cuts the bread in four equal sections and arranges them in a star-shaped pattern. A breakfast ritual of some kind. 
MANNY Ah! There you go! The way you like 'em, Chu-chu... (He pours a glass of milk.) We're low on milk, you remind Grampa to pick some up tonight, okay? 
He walks over to Chuy's tent bed. He pulls the sheets aside. 
His grandson is gone.

EXT. SEWAGE FILTRATION PLANT - PREDAWN 
Sewage water BUBBLES in huge tanks. 
A WORKMAN walks down catwalks above the tank, disengaging the larger pieces of debris from the filter areas with grappling hooks.  Shoes, tires, rags... 
A GRINDING SOUND is heard.  The Workman YELLS out to a CONTROL BOOTH above. 
WORKMAN Hold up!  We gotta block on filter D. 
SOUND of the pump coming to a halt. 
The Workman walks to the filter area.  He sinks his grappling hook into the polluted waters. 
UNDERWATER SHOT 
Spooky, silent. The grappling hook moves like a scythe to the filter... 
...past long, soft filaments of RAGGED TISSUE... 
...and connects with a LARGER FORM. 
ABOVE WATER 
The Workman feels the grappling hook connecting.  He gives a YANK, hooking whatever it is. 
He begins pulling it up. 
A PALE FORM bubbles to the surface. 
The Workman's face goes pale. 
WORKMAN Oh, God... 
A grating VOICE from the control booth is heard over the P.A. 
CONTROL BOOTH VOICE What's the problem? 
It take the Workman a moment to speak. 
WORKMAN I think it's a baby! 
The Workman pulls the form (as if that will do any good) toward the edge of the tank. 
He bends down, and now gets his first good look at it. 
The Workman SCREAMS. 
His grappling hook falls from his hand, into the sewage.

INT. HOSPITAL - ICU WARD 
Susan watches Siri from behind a pane of glass.  Siri is connected to a respirator, her vital signs monitored by several machines. 
Raymond approaches Susan, two cups of coffee in his hands. 
RAYMOND How you feeling? 
SUSAN You tell me. 
He smiles, gives her one of the cups. 
RAYMOND Your blood tests were all negative. You checked out. 
Susan visibly relaxes.  She looks back at the ICU ward. 
SUSAN What about Siri? 
RAYMOND She's stable.  I don't think there's any immediate danger, but we'll have to keep her under observation... 
SUSAN You think it's some form of Strickler's, don't you? 
Beat.  Raymond shrugs. 
RAYMOND Pathology's still working on the tissue samples.  If it is...it must be an errant strain.  Shorter incubation period. (Beat.) I'm sorry, Sue.  We just don't know yet. 
INT. HOSPITAL - BATHROOM 
At the sink, Susan runs water over her hands, her face, trying to collect herself.  She looks up in the mirror. We see that her eyes are swollen, tear-stained. 
INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY

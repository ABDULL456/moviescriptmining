LISA Bad time? 
DEREK (WARY) No...

DEREK Tell him he'll have it end of the day. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED:

DEREK You're working Joe's desk? 
LISA Just for today. light laugh) He's a real screamer, isn't he? 
DEREK Don't let him fool you.   His bark really is as bad as his bite. 
Lisa smiles and exits.    Derek is thinking Great, maybe she doesn't remember.

EXT. DEREK'S OFFICE - LATER

PATRICK Okay if I take off? 
DEREK Yeah, go home. 
PATRICK See you tomorrow. 
Patrick leaves. Through the open door, Derek can see other workers leaving, getting on the elevator. Lisa is one of them. She doesn't even look his way. 
Derek relaxes, goes back to his work. 
CUT TO: 
INT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT 
Derek walks to his Yukon SUV, the only car remaining.        He BEEPS it and the doors unlock. 
As Derek opens the driver's door and slides inside, the passenger door opens and Lisa slips in, wearing her overcoat and an intimate smile. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DEREK (STARTLED) What are you -- 
LISA I owe you an apology for the Christmas party. I think I sort of took you by surprise. 
DEREK (UNEASY) We both had a few drinks.   Just forget it.       L ISA What if I can't? 
DEREK Lisa... nothing happened. 
LISA All right, have it your way.   Nothing happened. 
Lisa lets the front of her overcoat fall open.        She's naked underneath. 
DEREK (jolt of panic) You really need to get out of my car. 
LISA Why? 
DEREK This is so not right. 
LISA Relax. Nobody's around to see us now. God, I almost went insane today, didn't you? Having to go pretend like I was concentrating on work when all I could think about -- 
DEREK (FLARING) Lisa, get out of my car! 
LISA (startled; confused) Derek, what's wrong? What did I do?

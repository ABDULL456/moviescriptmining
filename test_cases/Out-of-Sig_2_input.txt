INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME 
As Foley finally shoves Maurice down the stairs.  Maurice rolls down a few steps, right over White Boy Bob, as... 
Foley gets up, runs back to the bedroom. 
INT. RIPLEY'S BEDROOM - SAME 
As Foley enters, goes straight to Kenneth's body, begins searching for the shotgun (lifting the covers, turning over the body, etc) with no success... 
FOLEY Shit... 
INT. STAIRWELL - SAME 
As Maurice attempts to prise the gun out from under the dead bulk of White Boy Bob. 
INT. RIPLEY'S BEDROOM - SAME 
As Foley, exasperated, stands back up... 
MIDGE (O.S.) This what you want? 
Foley looks to where Midge stands -- now back in her bathrobe, but more importantly, clutching the shotgun.  Foley crosses and takes it from her, begins to stride out of the room, when -- 
MIDGE (CONT'D) It's empty. 
Foley just looks at her. 
INT. STAIRWELL - SAME 
As Maurice finally rolls White Boy Bob over, grabs the gun... 
INT. RIPLEY'S BEDROOM - SAME 
As Foley sticks his hand in Kenneth's coveralls, comes out with a shell, loads the gun, snaps it shut... 
INT. STAIRWELL - SAME 
As Maurice cocks the pistol, takes a step up the stairs... 
KAREN (OS) Maurice-- 
Maurice spins around, points his gun down at Karen, now standing in the foyer, her own gun pointing up at him... 
EXT. HOUSE - SAME TIME 
As Raymond Cruz and several green-and-whites arrive... 
INT. RIPLEY'S BEDROOM - SAME 
As Jack, about to exit, stops cold as he HEARS TWO GUNSHOTS, then a BODY FALL. 
He stands still.  Not sure who was just shot.  After a long moment, we then hear: 
KAREN (OS) Jack? 
He sees Midge looking at him, closes his eyes, sags against the wall. 
KAREN (OS) (CONT'D) I know you're up there. 
INT. FOYER - SAME 
As Foley steps into the hallway, his ski mask now pulled down over his face.  He holds Kenneth's shotgun in one hand and his pistol in another. 
KAREN Come on, Jack -- don't. 
FOLEY Pretend I'm somebody else. 
KAREN You think I'd shoot you? 
Foley brings up the pistol and the shotgun.  AND NOW WE HEAR THE SIRENS... 
FOLEY If you don't, one of those guys will. 
KAREN What're you now, a desperado?  Put the guns down. 
FOLEY I told you, I'm not going back. 
He raises the guns hip-high and we hear sounds behind Karen, but she's quick to raise her hand, though she doesn't turn or look around. 
KAREN Don't do this.  Please. 
They stand there staring at each other. 
FOLEY No more time outs. 
He raises the guns.  She sadly shakes her head. 
KAREN You win, Jack. 
She fires and he falls to the staircase, dropping the guns, grabbing hold of his right thigh.  And now Cruz and several other cops enter... Karen motions them to stop... 
CRUZ Karen, I told you not to-- 
KAREN Wait, I know him --okay? 
She goes up the staircase to where Foley is lying and gently lifts the ski mask and looks at his sad eyes. 
KAREN (CONT'D) I'm sorry, Jack, but I can't shoot you. 
FOLEY You just did, for Christ sake. 
KAREN You know what I mean. 
She glances about, makes sure no one can hear, then leans closer to him. 
KAREN (CONT'D) I wish things were different.  I'm sorry, Jack. 
Foley looks like he's in pain.  He watches as she walks back down the stairs.  As a couple of uniform cops rush past her and pick up Foley, a shaky Ripley staggers into the foyer. 
MIDGE Richard! 
She comes running down the stairs into his arms.  They embrace. He looks at Foley over her shoulder...

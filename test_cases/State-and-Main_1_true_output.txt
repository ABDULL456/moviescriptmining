They stop in front of a rack of fifty "factory seconds." 
Black and red hunting jackets, in front of the sporting goods store.  The sign reads "FACTORY SECONDS, FIVE DOLLARS." 
BILL A jacket for five dollars... I can buy this town for fifty bucks. 
WALT You told me that about the last town. 
BILL Yeah, but they never made a movie here. 
WALT I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm bleeding... 
BILL ...why am I here? 
WALT What, what, what, what do they got that can pass for the Old Mill? 
Bill shows Walt a brochure from Waterford, which shows a picture of the Old Mill.  Walt reads. 
WALT (CONT'D) "The Waterford Mill, built in 1825, and long a tourist attraction..." Wake up Uberto 
ANGLE: 
INT. THE AIRPORT VAN - CONTINUOUS 
UBERTO is asleep.  Bill wakes him up. 
UBERTO Where are we? 
WALT Givvem a cigarette... 
Uberto comes out of the car and squints around. 
UBERTO ...they ship our Old Mill from New Hampshire? 
BILL They're holding our Old Mill for ransom. 
UBERTO We build it? 
BILL We don't have to build it. 
He shows Uberto the brochure. 
UBERTO We build the fire hut? 
Walt shows Uberto the Firehouse.  Uberto looks through the viewfinder. 
UBERTO (CONT'D) We have to lose the window. 
WALT ...we can't lose the wind... 
UBERTO (pulling out storyboards) Then I can't do this shot... you wants me to push in -- I can't push in through the window... we go back to New Hampshire? 
BILL NO, we can't ever go back to New Hampshire. 
A pick-up truck with two calves in it stops, the driver seen from the back is a farmer smoking a pipe. 
WALT NO, we're gonna stay here.  This is what my people died for.  The right to make a movie in this town. 
INT. TAVERN INN LOBBY - DAY 
A desk clerk, SCOTT, looks up.  Behind the desk a display of several souvenir plates, "Souvenir of Waterford, VT", with a picture of the Old Mill on them.  Walt picks one up and hands it to Bill. 
SCOTT May I help you? 
WALT (followed Bill) I want to talk to the manager. 
Walt talks into his cell phone as he talks to Scott. 
SCOTT Would you like a room? 
BILL Na, we wanna rent the whole hotel. 
WALT (into phone) Hello, Tracy, we gotta new town. We're...where are we? 
BEAT.  Bill looks around, sees a sign on a desk.  Consults his tourist folder.  As they talk they walk into deserted ballroom and play shuffleboard and archery. 
BILL (carrying Waterford plate) Waterford, Vermont. 
WALT ...you got to get me that street for nothing... 
BILL I will. 
WALT (into phone) Waterford, Vermont.  Where is it? That's where it is... 
Walt carries the shuffleboard stick over his shoulder. 
INT. WALT'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
Walt is talking on a cellphone.  A male P.A. is bringing in bags of equipment.  Bill is still sitting perched on a desk, typing into his computer.  Uberto is sitting on a couch, smoking. 
We see the shuffleboard stick on the desk, and the Old Mill plate on the wall. 
WALT (to phone) Because, because...we don't have to build an Old Mill.  They have an Old Mill.  Yeah.  It's on a stream -- that's where you put a mill. 
BILL ...they run on water. 
WALT (to phone) Now: I'm looking at the...

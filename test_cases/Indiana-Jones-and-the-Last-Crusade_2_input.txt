SINISTER MAN Welcome to Iskenderun. The Director of the Museum of Antiquities has sent a car for you. 
BRODY takes off his hat. 
BRODY Oh, what?... your servant, sir. 
SALLAH And I am his. 
SINISTER MAN Follow me, please. 
The man turns and joins a SECOND MAN. BRODY and SALLAH follow them. 
BRODY My reputation precedes me. 
SALLAH There is no museum in Iskenderun. 
The SECOND MAN overhears SALLAH. He and his companion turn quickly. 
SECOND MAN Papers please. 
SALLAH Papers? (laughs) Of course. 
CONTINUED: (2) 
SALLAH puts Brody's luggage down and glances at BRODY. 
SALLAH Run. 
BRODY does not run. SALLAH pats his clothing, searching for his papers. 
BRODY Yes. 
SALLAH Papers, sir. Got it here. 
SALLAH laughs and pulls out a newspaper. 
SALLAH Just finished reading it myself. (laughs; then, to Brody) Run! 
BRODY looks confused. SALLAH shows the newspaper to the SECOND MAN. 
BRODY Yes. 
SALLAH Egyptian Mail. Morning edition. (to Brody) Run! 
BRODY Did you say...? Uh, uh... 
SALLAH puts the newspaper in front of the SECOND MAN's face, then punches him through the newspaper. 
SALLAH Run! 
The SECOND MAN falls, knocking over a vendor's stand. SALLAH and BRODY begin to run. SALLAH knocks the FIRST MAN into another vendor's stand. The STAND COLLAPSES on impact. 
SALLAH grabs BRODY and pulls him through the crowded streets. 
SALLAH (to Brody; pointing) Okay, okay, quick, quick, quickl Hide in that doorl Hide in that door! 
SALLAH points to a DARKENED DOORWAY, hung with a curtain, at the top of a ramp. BRODY runs up the ramp, throws back the curtain and disappears into the darkness. 
CONTINUED: (3) 
ThenMETAL DOORS ARE SLAMMED behind Brody and we realize that he has actually run into the back of a Nazi TROOP TRUCK. 
SALLAH runs after the Truck until he reaches a wall, then leans against the wall dejectedly as the Truck drives away with BRODY inside. 
INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY 
The room is dark. Ancient, floor-length drapes cover the windows. A HUGE FIREPLACE that's nearly large enough for a man to stand upright in dominates one wall. 
The NAZI GUARDS have tied INDY and HENRY back-to-back in a pair of chairs. ELSA and DONOVAN stand over them. VOGEL enters. 
HENRY Intolerable. 
VOGEL Doctor Schneider. Message from Berlin. You must return immediately: a rally at the Institute of Aryan Culture. 
ELSA So? 
VOGEL Your presence on the platform is requested... at the highest level. 
ELSA Thank you, Herr Oberst. (to DONOVAN) I will meet you at Iskenderun. 
DONOVAN Take this Diary to the Reich Museum in Berlin. It will show them our progress, ahead of schedule. Without a map, I'm afraid it's no better than a souvenir. 
He hands her the Grail Diary. 
VOGEL (to DONOVAN, meaning Indy and Henry) Let me kill them now. 
CONTINUED: 
ELSA No. If we fail to recover the pages from Brody, we'll need them alive. 
DONOVAN (to VOGEL, with a helpless shrug) Always do what the doctor orders. 
DONOVAN leads VOGEL out. The NAZI GUARDS follow. Once they are gone, ELSA turns to INDY. 
ELSA Don't look at me like thatwe both wanted the Grail, I would have done anything to get it. You would have done the same. 
INDY shakes his head "no."

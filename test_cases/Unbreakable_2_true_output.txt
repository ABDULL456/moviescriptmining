Elijah thinks it over. He nods, "Yes." 
ELIJAH'S MOTHER Well, go get it then. 
ELIJAH Where is it? 
ELIJAH'S MOTHER On a bench, across the street. 
Elijah looks at his mother with disbelief. 
ELIJAH'S MOTHER You calling me a liar? 
She points to the window. Beat. Elijah gets up and moves to the only window in the room. 
The view from his room looks out over a narrow street. On the other side of the street is a public playground. A handful of children are playing on it. 
There are three benches to one side of the swings. On one of them is a THIN PACKAGE wrapped in brown paper with a bow on it. 
Elijah looks to his mom who has joined him at the window. 
ELIJAH Someone's gonna take it. 
Beat. 
ELIJAH'S MOTHER Then you better get out there soon. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. PLAYGROUND - AFTERNOON 
Elijah walks across the playground. He's very wary of the other children running about him. 
He walks towards the bench with the present on it. Takes a seat. Puts the package on his lap. It's flat. The edges of the bend down over his thin legs. 
He undoes the white bow. He peels off the clear tape holding the brown paper together. He unfolds the paper. Beat. 
Elijah stares down at the single comic book in his lap. 
He feels the shadow of his mother. She takes a seat next to him. 
ELIJAH'S MOTHER I bought a whole bunch. They'll be one of these waiting for you, every time you want to come out here. 
Beat. 
ELIJAH'S MOTHER They said this one has a surprise ending. 
Elijah looks to his mother. His intelligent piercing eyes take her in for a moment. 
He looks back down at his lap. He opens the first page... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. STORE - DAY 
The same intelligent piercing eyes, twenty-five years older. Elijah has grown into a handsome, regal looking man. He leans on a walking stick. 
He's looking at an impressively framed charcoal sketch on a wall. Two figures are depicted on the top of a building locked in fierce battle. One figure is extremely muscular with a mask. The other is half human, half animal. 
MAN This is from Fritz Champion's own library. This is before the first issue of the comic book hit the stands in 1968. 
Elijah glances at the BUSINESS MAN standing next to him and then back to the sketch. 
ELIJAH It's a classic depiction of good versus evil. Notice the square jaw of Slayer - common in most comic book heroes. And the slightly disproportionate size of Jaguaro's body to his head. This again is common, but only in villains... The thing to notice about this piece... The thing that makes it very, very special... is its realistic depiction of its figures. When the characters eventually made it into the magazine they were exaggerated... as always happens. (beat) This is vintage. 
The business man rubs his face. Gazes at the sketch. Beat. 
BUSINESS MAN Wrap it up. 
ELIJAH You've made a considerably wise decision. 
Elijah starts to the back of the store which we now see is some type of art gallery where all the framed pictures are images and sketches from comic books. 
BUSINESS MAN My kid's gonna go berserk. 
Elijah jams his walking stick into the extra thick carpet and stops. He turns. 
ELIJAH Once again please? 
BUSINESS MAN My son Jeb. It's a gift for him. 
ELIJAH How old is Jeb? 
BUSINESS MAN Four. 
ELIJAH No.

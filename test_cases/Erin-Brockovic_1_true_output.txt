ED Erin -- hi.  Sorry you had to wait.  Here, sit down, sit down. 
He clears a stack of papers off a chair. 
ERIN Thanks a lot. (as she sits) I tell you, I never thought just standing would take it out of me, but ever since that shithead hit me, it feels like my whole body's put together wrong. 
Ed gives her a look of pro-forma sympathy. 
ED Jesus, you poor thing. (he sits) Well, listen, you came to the right place. Whoever did this to you made one hell of a mistake, and you and me, we're gonna make him pay for it. 
He takes out a pad and paper, gets ready to write. 
ED Why don't you tell me what happened? 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COURTROOM - DAY 
Erin is on the stand, wearing the most conservative thing she owns: a red, form-fitting mini dress, telling her story to Ed, who's questioning her. 
ERIN I was pulling out real slow, and out of nowhere, his Jaguar comes racing around the corner like a bat outta hell ... 
She glances at the defendant's table, where a DOCTOR sits nobly in surgical scrubs.  His WIFE and two beautiful KIDS are behind him.  A frigging Norman Rockwell painting. 
LATER IN HER TESTIMONY: 
ERIN They took some bone from my hip and put it in my neck.  I didn't have insurance, so I'm about seventeen thousand in debt right now. 
STILL LATER: 
ERIN ... couldn't take painkillers cause they made me too groggy to take care of my kids. 
STILL LATER: 
ERIN ... Matthew's six, Katie's four, and Beth's just nine months. 
STILL LATER: 
ERIN ... just wanna be a good mom, a nice person, a decent citizen.  Just wanna take good care of my kids.  You know? 
ED (oh so moved) Yeah.  I know. 
INT. COURTROOM - LATER 
Erin is still on the stand.  But now the doctor's lawyer is questioning her. 
DEFENDING LAWYER Seventeen thousand in debt.  Whew.  Is your ex-husband helping out? 
ERIN Which one? 
DEFENDING LAWYER (feigning shock) There's more than one? 
ERIN Yeah.  There's two.  Why? 
Erin looks over at the jury.  The personification of conservative family values.  Oh, shit. 
LATER IN HER TESTIMONY: 
ERIN (getting defensive) ... not like a career, cause I had my babies. But I woulda worked, for sure, if I didn't have this neck thing. 
Erin sees a juror staring judgmentally at her short hem. Erin gives it a tug, pulling it down a stitch. 
DEFENDING LAWYER (sarcastic) Right.  No doubt. 
Erin sees a few jurors share dubious glances.  Great. 
STILL LATER: 
The defendant's lawyers is on the offensive.  Erin's starting to feel the case slipping away. 
DEFENDING LAWYER So.  You must've been feeling pretty desperate that afternoon. 
ERIN (pointed) What's your point? 
Ed shakes his head slightly to her -- don't get mad. 
DEFENDING LAWYER Broke, three kids, no job.  A doctor in a Jaguar must've looked like a pretty good meal ticket. 
Erin sees jurors nodding almost imperceptibly in agreement. She's on a sinking ship. 
ERIN What?  Hey -- he hit me. 
DEFENDING LAWYER So you say. 
ERIN He came tearing around the corner, out of control -- 
DEFENDING LAWYER An ER doctor who spends his days saving lives was the one out of control -- 
ERIN (erupting) That asshole smashed in my fucking neck! 
INT. COURTHOUSE HALLWAY - DAY 
The door to the courtroom flies open and Erin comes out, furious.  Ed follows her as she heads for the elevator. 
ERIN Open and shut?  Open and fucking shut? 
ED If you hadn't used profanity -- 
ERIN Oh, please, it was long over by then.  God damn, he made me look like some cheap -- 
ED I told you the questions might get a little personal --

coming out of the stadium, his bats and gloves over his shoulder. He has on his spikes and a pair of boxer shorts. 
INT. BEAT-UP MEXICAN BUS - DAY 
Taylor sits in the back seat. He has six Coke bottles filled with sand strapped to his ankles. He lifts his legs up and down to strengthen his muscles. 
OMIT 
Sequence omitted from original script. 
EXT. INDIANS' TRAINING CAMP PRACTICE FIELD - DAY 
Donovan, Brown and two of his coaches, PEPPER LEACH (pitching) and DUKE TEMPLE (hitting) are on the field, witnessing the arrival of their "troops." First to arrive is: 
TAYLOR 
He gets out of a taxi and goes to the trunk to get his bats and luggage. 
DONOVAN This looks like Jake Taylor. 
Brown turns around from a conversation with Temple. 
BROWN He was an Allstar in Boston, wasn't he? 
DONOVAN Yeh. 
PEPPER Wish we had him two years ago. 
DONOVAN We did. 
PEPPER Four years ago then. 
INT. PLAYER'S BARRACKS - DAY 
Like an Army barracks. Rows of bunk beds seperated by lockers. Taylor walks in with Temple, the hitting instructor. 
TAYLOR What happened to the private rooms? 
TEMPLE We're on an austerity program. This is what happens when you finish 24 games out. 
BROWN, PEPPER, TEMPLE AND DONOVAN 
back at the field, supervising the arrival of more players. 
The first is a tall, muscular Latin, PEDRO CERRANO, dressed in black from head to toe. He arrives on foot, carrying a black suitcase and pulling a black bat case on wheels. He looks like a gunfighter coming into Dodge. 
BROWN Who's that? 
DONOVAN I think it's Cerrano. Defected from Cuba. Wanted religious freedom. 
BROWN What's his religion? 
DONOVAN Voodoo. 
BLACK AND TAN ROLLS-ROYCE 
pulling into the parking lot. Out steps RODGER DORN, high- priced third baseman. Brown eyes him with vague disapproval. 
BROWN Thought you didn't have any high- priced talent. 
DONOVAN (sheepish) I forgot about Dorn, 'cause he's only high-priced. Got him as a free agent three years ago. 
BROWN Still hits the ball pretty well, doesn't he? 
DONOVAN Yeh, he just can't field it. 
Dorn pulls his golf clubs out of the car. 
BROWN We'll shape him up. 
WILLIE HAYES 
a 22-year-old black, pulling up in a '72 VW Beetle which he's got a Cadillac grille on. He steps out in his shades and sharkskin suit. 
DONOVAN Don't recognize this guy. 
Hayes strolls up and introduces himself. 
HAYES Say hey, Willie Mays Hayes here. I play like Mays and run like Hayes. 
BROWN Lou Brown. Nice to meet ya, Hayes. 
HAYES Thanks. Well, I gotta get my stuff... 
Hayes hustles off toward his car.

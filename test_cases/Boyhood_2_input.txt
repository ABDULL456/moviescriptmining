SAMANTHA Well, what's gonna happen to them? What happens when their legal guardian is dangerous and abusive? 
MOM You know, I don't know honey. I called their mom. I called the Child Protective Services. You know, I have you and your brother. We were in a dangerous situation. You're my responsibility. 
SAMANTHA Are we ever gonna see them again? 
MOM I don't know. And I hope so. 
SAMANTHA How much longer are we gonna be here? 
Mom fights back tears. 
MOM Not long. We're... (starts crying) Oh, I don't -- I don't know. I don't have the answer to everything. 
CAROL Hey, listen. We are happy to have you here as long as you want. As long as you need. This is fun for us, isn't it? 
ABBY Mm-hmm. 
CAROL Yeah, it's like having a big sister? Like having a brother. 
MOM We're gonna help out, right? You're not even gonna know we're here. 
CAROL Okay. 
EXT.   SCHOOL - DAY 
Mom pulls up to drop Samantha off at the front doors of her new Junior High School. 
SAMANTHA Mom, this is awful. You're dumping me in some parking lot of this school where I don't even know anyone! I'm leaving all my friends and I didn't even get to say goodbye! I don't know where to go! 
MOM Okay, Samantha. You go right through that door. The office is right there. They're expecting you, they're gonna give you your schedule. Here's your lunch money. I will pick you up right here at 3:30. 
SAMANTHA I'm wearing dirty clothes! Because you wouldn't even let us get our stuff! We don't even have a place to live! This sucks! 
Samantha gets out of the car, slamming the door behind her. Mom screams out of the window as she walks away. 
MOM Samantha... I'm doing the best I can! And you're right, it sucks! But it doesn't suck half as much as having a drunk fool slam your head against a wall! So cut your horseshit attitude. 
Mom turns to Mason in the back as he climbs toward the front seat. 
MOM (CONT'D) Put your seat belt on! 
INT.   SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY 
Mom is walking Mason to his class. 
MOM You know if you need anything I'm in room 112, right? 
Mason nods. 
MOM (CONT'D) Okay. This is Mrs. Darby's room. Oh, honey, it's gonna be okay. Okay? 
Mom leans in to kiss him. 
MASON Mom... 
Mason walks away, embarrassed at her public affection. 
INT.   SCHOOL CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS 
The students all make small talk as they wait for class to begin. Mason enters and looks to MRS. DARBY for instruction. 
MRS. DARBY Hi!   Are you Mason? 
MASON Yeah. 
MRS. DARBY Hi. I'm Mrs. Darby. I'm glad to meet you. Why don't you sit here? (to Kenny) Kenny! Off! 
Kenny climbs down from on top of his desk and takes his seat. 
KENNY Yes ma'am. 
MRS. DARBY Kenny. This is Mason and I want you to show him around today, okay? 
KENNY Got it. 
MRS. DARBY Okay. 
KENNY Hey dude.    Welcome to the suck. 
The boys trade a casual low five and exchange a smile. 
MRS. DARBY (O.S.) Everybody, listen up. We have a new student joining us today. His name is Mason, he's sitting in the back row. (MORE) 
MRS. DARBY (O.S.) (CONT'D) Kenny's gonna be his buddy, but I want each one of you to take the time today, to introduce yourselves, and welcome him to school. Okay? Alright? Let's get started. 
EXT.   NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAY 
Mason pushes an Obama/Biden campaign sign into the ground, before he and Samantha walk across the street. Samantha waits in the street with more signs, while Mason knocks on the RESIDENT's front door. 
RESIDENT   (O.S.) What? 
The white-haired Resident is standing to Mason's right, beneath his carport. 
MASON Oh, hi. Can I put an Obama sign in your yard? 
RESIDENT Do I look like a Barack Hussein Obama supporter? 
Mason shrugs. 
RESIDENT (CONT'D) No. 
Mason turns to leave. 
RESIDENT (CONT'D) This is private property. Get off. I could shoot you! 
He rejoins Samantha at the street. 
MASON What a dick. 
SAMANTHA He had a Confederate flag on his house. 
EXT.   NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - MOMENTS LATER 
Samantha is now talking to a young, BLONDE HOUSEWIFE. 
BLONDE HOUSEWIFE I love it! (MORE) 
BLONDE HOUSEWIFE (CONT'D) Young Obama supporters out on the trail. This is great! Are you doing this through your school? 
SAMANTHA Um.   Our dad's a big supporter. 
BLONDE HOUSEWIFE Oh, that's great. I mean, we've just got to pull together to get this win, right? 
SAMANTHA Yeah. 
BLONDE HOUSEWIFE Oh, I just love him so much. I mean I have these dreams where I'm just kissing him because I just love him so much! He's so cute, isn't he? 
SAMANTHA (laughs) Yeah. 
BLONDE HOUSEWIFE Do you know, I made these t-shirts for my kids. "My Momma's for Obama!" Do you like it? It's good, right? Yeah. 
Samantha turns to walk towards the street.

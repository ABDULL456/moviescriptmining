FORD Wow... 
MARVIN I know.    Dreadful, isn't it? 
ARTHUR Sorry about the landing.    Where are we? 
ZAPHOD Magrathea! 
FORD Wrong. This is the Vogon planet.     This is Vogsphere. 
ZAPHOD No.   It's Magrathea!   I know it! 
Ford reaches in his satchel, pulls out a sort of ELECTRONIC BERET, pulls it snugly onto Zaphod's head. 
FORD Little something I learned about on an Altairian star cruiser. Captains use them when they really need to concentrate. 
ARTHUR What is it? 
FORD A Thinking Cap. 
Zaphod squints hard to think as he looks around. 
70       EXT. VOGCITY                                                      70 
THEIR P.O.V. -- there are rows and rows of dull, gray, rectangular buildings as far as the eye can see. 
(69 cont) The three men step out of the ship.                          (69 cont) 
MARVIN This will all end in tears, I just know it. 
Marvin moves out, a few paces behind. 
FORD I checked the guide for ways to rescue a prisoner from Vogsphere. It said "Don't." I'm assuming your plan is better.

ARTHUR Well, I sort of had this idea we could... 
A TELESCOPIC ROD WITH A PADDLE AT THE TOP shoots out of the ground, SMACKS Arthur on the face, then retracts. 
Arthur is stunned. None of the others have noticed. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) Did anyone see that? 
ZAPHOD See what? 
They look at Arthur. It suddenly seems ridiculous. 
ARTHUR Nothing. 
They all walk along - Arthur at the back, perplexed. 
FORD What was it? 
ARTHUR Nothing. Just my imagination. 
Another paddle springs up, double smack in the face. Arthur leaps back. Looks down. Nothing. Nothing at all. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) Alright, stop. Everyone stop and watch me. Something's happening. 
They watch.    Arthur walks. And walks. 
FORD Okay.     I think we... 
A paddle springs up and smacks Ford's face. 
FORD (CONT'D) AH! 
He leaps back, clutching his cheeks.      Arthur spins around. 
ARTHUR You, too? 
FORD Yes.    What was that? 
Arthur lifts his feet very carefully. 
FORD (CONT'D) I th... 
He stops himself and looks round.

FORD (CONT'D) What do you think, Zaphod? 
Zaphod pulls his thinking cap down, thinks hard. 
ZAPHOD I think we should keep going.

BOBBY GREEN (to Rosario) Baby--why don't you go keep Jumbo company, make sure he leaves a tip. 
ROSARIO DIAZ `Kay... 
Rosario leaves the table.    Two GIRLS walk by: 
GIRL Hi, Bobby! 
Bobby nods to them.    Vadim watches them walk away.   Then: 
VADIM NEZHINSKI You know-- (moves closer; WHISPERED:) I still got my shit coming in. Some of us think you could help get it out there. 
BOBBY GREEN It's a little dangerous right now, don't you think? 
VADIM NEZHINSKI We got a lot of muscle behind us. Lotta muscle. 
The brazenness of the comment shocks Bobby. He looks up, begins to focus. Incredulous. Softly, as the camera ZOOMS INTO a CLOSE ANGLE on BOBBY: 
BOBBY GREEN Muscle--? 
VADIM NEZHINSKI That's right. 
BOBBY GREEN A cop got hit today. They ain't never gonna sit still for that. 
Another member of the gang speaks up: Pavel: 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
PAVEL LUBYARSKY Police are a fuckin' joke, dude-- the Mickey Mouse ain't gonna do nothing. 
Pavel LAUGHS, and Bobby looks at him with real resentment. Vadim pushes Pavel aside, motions for him to sit down elsewhere. Vadim pulls up a chair. Sits down. Intimate: 
VADIM NEZHINSKI Bobby, those cops--they, they ain't no problem. 
Vadim turns over his hand.   A SPIDER WEB TATTOO graces the palm of his right hand: 
VADIM NEZHINSKI (CONT'D) You see this? I got this on the inside, at Tchita. You earn these. (QUIET) So don't worry--we'll get `em all. Cut off the head, the body'll fall, right? You keep on doin' it `til they get the message. (even quieter) We got all their names. On a list. 
Vadim leans back in his chair. Bobby's eyes widen. Vadim makes a "POP" sound. Bobby tries to hide his shock. Vadim grabs Bobby's arm, squeezes it. 
VADIM NEZHINSKI CONT'D) Just think about it. You change your mind, you call Pavel. 
BOBBY GREEN (nods; then) I'll see you around... 
And the men move to another table. Bobby looks at Rosario and Louis, who're standing by the register. They turn back to Bobby and SMILE, totally unaware of the conversation that's just taken place. CLOSE SHOT ON BOBBY as we GO TO: 
EXT. POLICE SERVICE AREA NUMBER TWO 
It's a huge municipal structure.   Bobby bolts inside. 
INT. POLICE SERVICE AREA TWO - ENTRANCE 
The place is hopping, with police everywhere. Almost like a fraternity house. BOBBY CHARGES IN, looks around. Pushes his way through the crowd toward the main desk. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SERGEANT PROVENZANO, forties, rings a SILVER BELL, which is engraved with the words, "Homicide Bell." The room quiets down. Provenzano holds up his hands. Grinning: 
SERGEANT PROVENZANO Everybody! Our little "A" House got another coupla stiffs today, so it's time for another poem! (catcalls; reads from a pad) "The people of Brooklyn have been volleyed and thundered; at last the number slaughtered has reached one hundred!" 
APPLAUSE. Provenzano bows.        BOBBY shoves his way through the crowd. Urgently: 
BOBBY GREEN I need to find Deputy Chief Grusinsky. 
SERGEANT PROVENZANO Oh, uh, he's on the second floor, I think. In the muster room. 
EXT. POLICE SERVICE AREA NUMBER TWO - HALLWAY 
Bobby looks down the hall.       He SEES his father, talking to a CROWD of UNIFORMED COPS.       Burt sees him, keeps talking. Bobby touches his arm. 
BOBBY GREEN Pop, I gotta talk to you. 
BURT GRUSINSKY I'm working. 
BOBBY GREEN It's important--I got information. 
Bobby pulls his father aside, looks around to be sure the two of them are out of earshot of others. Forcefully: 
BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D) It's about you. 
Burt is surprised.       His attention sharpens: 
BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D) It's bad. 
Burt realizes the severity.       Then we HEAR: 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MICHAEL SOLO (O.S.) Jesus Christ, you gotta be kidding me! 
INT. POLICE SERVICE AREA NUMBER TWO - MUSTER ROOM

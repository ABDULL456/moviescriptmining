... then down to KAYLO'S crumpled body. He sees the stocking feet, the pumps ... his HEART starts to jitter - THUDUB ... LUB ... THUDUB ... his vision doubles ... he starts to swoon 
HOOD #1 (rationalizing) I mean we all gotta die sometime, right? 
HOOD #1 snickers.     The others share a tense laugh. 
CHEV That's true ... we all gotta die ...

CHEV stumbles, props himself up with one hand. 
CHEV (CONT'D) Right ... so ... let's all die ... 
HOOD #1 Eh? 
CHEV brings up his gun in the blink of an eye, draws a bead on HOOD #1 and is about to set off a SHOOTING GALLERY, when the ELEVATOR BELL CHIMES and the door SLIDES OPEN. 
EVE WALKS IN... looks around, and FREEZES. 
They all turn to look. 
HOOD #1 (CONT'D) What the...? 
CHEV affords himself about a second and a half of BUG-EYED SHOCK before snapping out of it and DROPPING HOOD #1 INSTANTLY WITH A SHOT TO THE HEAD. 
HAOS BREAKS OUT as the others dive for cover and start blasting. CHEV yanks KAYLO'S chair up and shoves it toward the HOODS - then makes a break for the elevator shaft, grabbing EVE as he goes. 
AYLO'S body screens CHEV and EVE as they run, taking hits, finally toppling over again. CHEV takes out another HOOD on the run, nailing him right between the eyes. 
HEV turns his back on the hoods, covering EVE, as they make a dive into the open elevator shaft and takes a BULLET IN THE ASS. 
CHEV OW! 
He spins and empties his clip at the HOODS, who hit the deck. 
EVE holds his ass as CHEV looks down the open elevator shaft. The elevator is half a floor down, moving slow. He grabs EVE, then the cable... they jump for it. INT DON KIM'S SHIRT FACTORY, 4TH FLOOR, SECONDS LATER CHEV and EVE hit the floor of the moving elevator with a CRASH and roll out onto the 4th floor. The workers are all in a panic, standing by their sewing machines - they've obviously heard the shots. The SUPERVISOR is walking around, shoving them back into their seats, screaming at everyone in Korean to keep working.

The SUPERVISOR, all of five feet, walks right up to CHEV and EVE, and starts screaming at them in broken English. 
SUPERVISOR You!    Assholes! What you want! 
EVE completely FLIPS OUT and starts SHOUTING DOWN the little man. 
EVE DON'T TALK TO ME LIKE THAT!! MY BOYFRIEND KILLS PEOPLE!!! 
CHEV Nice. 
The door on the far end of the room BUSTS OPEN and HOODS pour in from the stairwell. They spot him. 
CHEV and EVE duck low and start hoofing it down the rows of machines toward the windows. The HOODS fan out. They play cat and mouse in the maze of sewing machines and Koreans while the SUPERVISOR, oblivious, continues screaming and forcing the workers back into their chairs. 
CHEV puts a finger to EVE'S lips, calming her momentarily... 
... then comes up behind a youngish HOOD and shoves the HOOD'S gun hand under a vicious looking sewing machine at least fifty years old, operated by a Korean woman even older. THE RUSTY THING PUNCTURES HIS HAND OVER AND OVER AS HE SCREAMS, JUMPING UP AND DOWN, UNABLE TO GET FREE. 
HEV grabs the gun. They make for the fire escape. 
EXT FIRE ESCAPE, SECONDS LATER They reach the bottom of the ladder and are PINNED DOWN by gunfire from above. 
CHEV gives her a LOOK that says it all. 
EVE I had to see if you were telling the truth... oh, and you have my purse. 
CHEV notices the purse still over his shoulder, takes it off and hands it to her. With a quick upward glance he breaks cover and squeezes off 4 SHOTS, nailing two HOODS on the fire escape. 
CHEV Come on! Wait -

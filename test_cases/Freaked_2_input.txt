STUEY (V.0.) Rick! Over here! 
Stuey's waving cup is blocking the view of a big, annoyed BIKER sitting behind him. Elijah quiets the crowd and holds up a beaker of ointment. 
ELIJAH With this remarkable ointment of my own design, I will now turn this half-finished ghoul into the ultimate super freak, dedicated to evil! 
Elijah puts on some rubber gloves and prepares to glop Rick, who squints under the spotlight, still searching for Stuey. He calls out telepathically. 
RICK (V.0.) Stuey! Where are you?! 
Stuey stands up on his seat and waves the cup, totally blocking the biker's view. He telepathically replies. 
STUEY (V.0.) Here I am, Rick! 
BIKER (TO STUEY) Goddammit, kid! Would you sit down!? 
The biker grabs the cup and dumps it over Stuey's head. The "good ointment" runs down all over Stuey's body. 
STUEY AAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! 
All eyes turn to Stuey, who falls down and disappears onto the floor screaming. 
RICK Oh no! 
BIKER What the hell!? 
Suddenly an EIGHT FOOT TALL MONSTER VERSION OF STUEY leaps to its feet and snarls down at the biker. The biker pulls a switchblade and jams it into Stuey monster's leg--the blade crumples on his armor-like hide. Stuey grins and SLAM! He drives the biker into the ground like a railroad spike. He leaps onto the stage and stalks Elijah. 
STUEY MONSTER YOUR ASS IS MINE, SKUGGS! 
Rick and the freaks in the cage cheer stuey Monster on. 
ELIJAH Uh-oh, that kid looks pissed. EYE AND EYE! KILL HIM! 
Eye and Eye rush the stage, Uzis firing. 
EYE AND EYE RASTAFARI! 
The bullets bounce off Stuey's hide. He doinks them with his big monster fingers and sends them flying through... 
THE TENT ROOF 
across the compound, and THWOPP! Into the Giant Head's eye sockets, where they spin around and come to a stop, cockeyed. CRASH! The head's foundation crumbles and it keels over backwards. 
INT. CARNIVAL TENT 
Elijah calls out to Toad. 
ELIJAH TOAD! 
Stuey Monster roars at Toad. Toad smiles weakly. 
THE TENT ROOF 
Toad catapults through it, follows the path of Eye and Eye across the compound and CRASH! Lands head first into the neck of the Giant Head. He gets up with the Giant Head stuck on his own head, making him look like one of those big headed caricatures. He runs blindly across the yard and into... 
THE ELECTRIC FENCE 
ZZZAAAAPPP! BOINNGG! Eye and Eye zing out of the sockets, and Toad's tongue sticks ten feet out of the Giant Head's mouth. It's the biggest Tex Avery cartoon take ever! 
ELIJAH 
looks worried. He scoops up some "evil ointment". 
ELIJAH Looks like it's time to roll out the big gun. (TO RICK) Sayonara, kiddo. Any last words? 
Rick considers it. He can't think of anything. 
RICK Nahh. 
ELIJAH Suit yourself. 
He raises the ointment over Rick. Rick has an idea for a last word.

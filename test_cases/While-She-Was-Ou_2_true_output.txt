She guns the engine and ducks sideways as her car PLOWS into the barrier. 
There's a sickening crack as shattered windshield sprays around her. 
EXT. EDGE OF WOODS - EVENING 
The Explorer SLAMS through and VEERS towards a clump of trees. 
INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING 
Della tries to sit upright but the auto's spinning too fast. 
EXT. EDGE OF WOODS - EVENING 
The car swings, then CRASHES right into a Pine tree. 
INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING 
The Car stalls out. SILENCE. A prolonged moment. 
Then Della crawls out from under the dashboard, sweeping pine needles and glass from her hair. She reaches up and hits the light switch. 
Pine branches protrude through the broken windshield. 
Using the sleeve of her coat she sweeps broken glass from the driver's seat and sits down. 
She slides the gear into park, turns the key. The engine groans like a dying animal, then gives up. 
She takes a deep breath. 
She tries again. The engine groans again, another death rattle. It just won't catch. 
She switches off the interior light and pushes the driver door open. She steps out of the car.

EXT. EDGE OF WOODS - EVENING 
She closes the door behind her so's not to trigger the light switch. Finds her legs are giddy. Holds onto the door frame for a moment to steady herself. 
It looks like she's crashed at the very end of the housing development - where it cuts like a knife edge into an old forest. 
The dirt road stretches ahead beyond the barrier, into the midst of the forest. Behind her, shrouded in darkness, houses in different stages of development dot the deforested landscape. Land moving trucks sit on recently flattened land, waiting to tear into the next layer of forest. 
Patches of leftover snow and puddles of rain catch the light from the moon which hides in an overcast sky. 
Jesus! She's driven all the way from the Mall only to find herself in the middle of nowhere with a bunch of psychopaths on her tail. 
This must be some sick joke. 
Speaking of which, where are these little bastards? Her eyes scan the darkness for a sign. Nothing. That doesn't mean they're not close by. 
She checks out the damage to the car by feel. The driver's side is scratched and dented. The front is wedged into the tree. 
The only way out is for her to back up the car. 
She climbs back in for another try. 
INT.   FORD EXPLORER   - EVENING 
Della turns the key. It barely even groans this time. Just a faint gurgle. Then gone. 
She rifles in the glove compartment and pulls out the flare, sticks it in her pocket. 
She leans under the dash and manually pops the trunk. 
EXT.   EDGE OF WOODS - EVENING 
Della runs outside to the back of the car and feels about in the trunk. 
Scene 75Page 40 
She throws carrier bags full of wrapping paper to the side as she searches. Pulls out a lug wrench from underneath and then a small tool box. 
She hears the screech of a car's wheels spinning in mud. 
EXT. ROUGH ROAD - EVENING 
Della turns to see headlights in the distance on the road behind, pointing upwards. 
DELLA Huh!

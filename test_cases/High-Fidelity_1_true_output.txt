ROB What it was like. 
LAURA It was like sex.  What else could it be like? 
ROB Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex? 
LAURA What's the difference? 
ROB You know the difference. 
LAURA Look, we're okay now.  We just had a nice time.  Let's leave it at that. 
ROB Okay, that's cool, okay.  But the nice time we just had... was it nicer, as nice, or less nice than the nice times you were having a couple of weeks ago? 
Laura is silent. 
ROB Oh, c'mon, Laura.  Just say something. Lie, if you want.  It'd stop me asking you questions and it'd make me feel better. 
LAURA Well I was gonna lie and now I can't, because you'd know I was lying. 
ROB Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway? 
LAURA To make you feel better. 
ROB Oh, great... 
Rob begins to get out of bed.  She grabs his hand and pulls him back down. 
LAURA Look, Rob.  If great sex was as important as you think it is, and if I was having great sex with him, then we wouldn't be lying here now. And that is my last word on the subject, okay? 
ROB Okay. 
She pulls him close and they lie there, the matter seemingly settled. 
LAURA I wish your penis was as big as his, though. 
He turns slowly to her.  A giggle from her turns into a laugh, then a howl, a roar -- 
EXT. LAKEFRONT - TWILIGHT 
Rob and Laura walk the cement breakfront. 
LAURA ... Like Mexico.  Or Jamaica.  Or New York, even. 
ROB Hey, great idea.  What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way. 
LAURA I'll pay for you.  Even though you owe me money.  We have to do something with the money I earn.  I need to. I deserve it.  You can just think of it as winning the lottery. 
ROB Fantastic.  The Girlfriend Lottery. 
LAURA Money does not matter.  I do not care how much you earn.  I'd just like you to be a little happier in your work, but beyond that you can do what you like. 
ROB But it wasn't supposed to be like this.  When I met you we were the same people and now we're not, and... 
LAURA How?  How were we the same people? 
ROB Well, you were the kind of person who came to the Artful Dodger and I was the kind of person who deejayed at the Artful Dodger.  You wore jeans and T-shirts, and so did I.  And I still do, and you don't. 
LAURA Because I'm not allowed to.  I still do, after work.  So, what?  Should we just break up?  Is that what you're saying?  Because if you are, I'm going to run out of patience. 
ROB No, but... 
LAURA But what? 
ROB But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be? 
LAURA You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you.  If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs. 
ROB And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and... 
LAURA I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so. 
ROB You're tougher. 
LAURA More confident, maybe. 
ROB Harder. 
LAURA Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life? 
ROB I'm alright. 
LAURA Yeah, you're alright.  But you're certainly not happy.  So what happens if you get happy?  And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable?  What happens if you, I don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? Time for a new girlfriend?

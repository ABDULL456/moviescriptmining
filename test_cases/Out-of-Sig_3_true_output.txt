KAREN Till they got busted. 
ADELE That wasn't Jack's fault.  No, that was on account of Buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to a job before they'd done it instead of after.  She called the FBI and they both went down, ended up at Lompoc. (then) I think Buddy felt kinda bad about that. 
KAREN Any idea where I could find Buddy?  Or Glenn? 
Adele looks at Karen, then jumps at the sound of three quick raps on the door. 
CHINO'S VOICE Adele?  You in there? 
ADELE Yes. 
CHINO I want to speak with you, please. 
ADELE Who is it? 
CHINO'S VOICE I talk to the guy you work for, Emil. He tole me your number and where you live.  See, I'm looking for an assistant and would like to speak to you. 
ADELE Oh.  Uh-huh. 
CHINO'S VOICE You did work for Emil, right? 
ADELE Yeah, I was Emil's box-jumper for almost four years. 
CHINO'S VOICE You were his what, his box? 
ADELE His assistant. 
Karen looks at the door.  Something's wrong... through the glass bricks that line one side of the door, we see blurred movement on the other side, someone doing something... 
ADELE (CONT'D) You say you perform in the Miami area? 
CHINO'S VOICE Yes, around here.  I was a mayishan in Cuba before I come here.  Manuel the Mayishan was my name. 
And now Karen and Adele look at each other. 
CHINO'S VOICE (CONT'D) Can you open the door? 
Karen shakes her head "no." 
ADELE I'm not dressed. 
CHINO'S VOICE Listen to me. (lowers his voice) I'm a good friend of Jack Foley. 
Boom.  Karen gets to her feet, brings her bag to the edge of the table, sees Adele staring at her. 
KAREN Ask him his name. 
ADELE Who are you? 
CHINO'S VOICE (beat) Jose Chirino. 
Karen brings her Beretta out of the bag. 
CHINO'S VOICE (CONT'D) Or maybe you hear Jack Foley call me Chino.  I'm the same person. 
Karen moves along the table to Adele... 
KAREN (soft) Tell him to wait in the hall, you have to get dressed.  Say it loud. 
As Adele speaks, Karen racks the slide on her 9mm. 
ADELE Wait in the hall!  I have to get dressed! 
CHINO'S VOICE Tell me where is Jack Foley, I don't bother you no more. 
Karen motions for Adele to keep talking as she takes a position beside the door, where we now see Chino's silhouette in one of the three glass panels in the centre of the door. 
ADELE I don't know where he is. 
CHINO'S VOICE Listen, I'm the one help Jack escape from prison.  He tole me, I can't find him to see you.  So why don't you open this fucking door.  Okay?  So we can speak. 
ADELE (staring at Karen) Go away, or I'll call the police. 
CHINO'S VOICE Why you want to do that, to a frien'? 
Adele says nothing.  Then... 
CHINO'S VOICE (CONT'D) Okay, you don't want to help me, I'm leaving. (then) I'm going now.  I see you maybe some time, okay?  Bye bye. 
KAREN (low) Go in the bedroom and -- 
Suddenly, Chino's fist -- wrapped in his shirt -- explodes through one of the glass panels.  Adele and Karen both jump as Chino pushes his arm through, reaches for the door knob... 
...but Karen grabs the knob first and, using all of her weight as leverage, pivots and flings the door open with Chino's arm still sticking through the glass... 
...the force of which slingshots the man into the room where he bangs against a wall and falls to the floor.  Dazed, Chino reaches for his .22 as he now tries to get to his feet. 
Karen brings up her Beretta in two hands, cocks it and puts the front sight on his chest. 
KAREN (CONT'D) Leave it where it is. 
CHINO (frowning) Wait.  You not Adele? 
KAREN I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest.  Put the gun on the table.  I mean, now. 
CHINO Oh.  Then this must be Adele... 
He now aims the gun point-blank at Adele. 
KAREN Put it down or I'll shoot. 
CHINO You wouldn't shoot me, would you? 
KAREN What do you want to bet? 
CHINO (beat) I could walk out of here. 
KAREN If you move, if you look at her again, you're dead. 
Chino doesn't move.  Keeps his gun on Adele.  Karen starts walking towards him...

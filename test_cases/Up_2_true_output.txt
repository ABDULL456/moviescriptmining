Carl steps out from behind a shrub.   The SQUEALING is in fact his HEARING AID. 
CARL Darn thing. (calling back) C'mon, Russell, would you hurry it up? 
Russell plods forward, dragging his feet. 
RUSSELL I'm tiiiired. And my knee hurts. 
CARL Which knee? 
RUSSELL My elbow hurts and I have to go to the bathroom. 
CARL I asked you about that five minutes ago! 
RUSSELL Well, I didn't have to go then! Russell goes limp and lies face down in the dirt. 
RUSSELL I don't want to walk anymore.     Can we stop? 
CARL Russell! If you don't hurry up, the tigers will eat you. 
RUSSELL There's no tigers in South America. Russell rolls over to show Carl a badge. 
RUSSELL Zoology. 
CARL Oh, for the love of Pete. Go on into the bushes and do your business. 
RUSSELL Okay!   Here, hold my stuff. 
Somehow energized, Russell jams his pack into Carl's hands, secures his rope to a tree and tromps off into the shrubs. 
He goes into the woods carrying a small shovel in one hand and a pile of leaves in another. 
RUSSELL I've always wanted to try this! 
Carl waits, standing by the tree his house is tied to. 
RUSSELL (O.S.) Mr. Fredricksen? Am I supposed to dig the hole before or after? 
CARL Eugh!   None of my concern! Beat. 
RUSSELL (O.S.) Oh.    It's before! 
Carl covers his ears. 
EXT. MOUNTAIN, THICK JUNGLE - CONTINUOUS 
Russell pats down a mound and SIGHS in satisfaction. 
He is about to return to Carl when he spots some TRACKS. 
RUSSELL Huh?  Tracks?! 
(REALIZING) Snipe! Russell follows the tracks into the dark jungle, clapping. 
RUSSELL Here, snipe... Come on out, snipe. Snipe! The footprints continue for a time, then stop. 
RUSSELL Huh. Russell munches on a chocolate bar. 
Something RUSTLES in the bushes behind him.   He turns to look. Behind him, A BEAK takes a nibble of the chocolate and zips out. 
Russell turns.    Nothing there. 
Another nibble!   Zip! 
RUSSELL Ha! Gotcha! 
Russell peers into the shrub. 
RUSSELL Don't be afraid, little snipe. I am a Wilderness Explorer so I am a friend to all of nature. Want some more? 
Russell holds out the chocolate.   The beak pokes out and nibbles. 
RUSSELL Hi boy.    Don't eat it all.   Come on out. 
The beak zips back into the bushes.

A WINDSTORM starts, the source being Krueger's own lungs. The gale force begins to yank at the shroud surrounding Springwood.  Fingers of darkness pull up from the town and towards Freddy's mouth -- and houses begin to DISSOLVE. Freddy continues to inhale like he's never going to stop. 
Krueger is sucking the black gloom into his body - and the entire town of Springwood is going with it.  Trees, buildings, cars, picket fences.  It's all crumbling and fusing, becoming a part of t cloud that itself is caught in the nightmarish wind tunnel, all piling into Freddy's mouth. 
The vortex swirls into Krueger.  Then it's gone.  Nothing but a vacant lot the size of a town remains.  Freddy turns to Jacob and BURPS, it sounds like a THUNDERCLAP. 
JACOB No! 
FREDDY Don't worry, I have a strong stomach. 
Freddy reaches down and yanks up his red and green sweater. He pulls apart his putrid abdomen to reveal his guts - and a transparent stomach. 
Inside the stomach: a black swirling mass.  Flashes of houses, people, homes, couples, all trapped in horrible anguish.  Freddy drops down his sweater. 
FREDDY (cont'd) Springwood is mine, boy! 
JACOB I dreamed you away before I was born! Mom said you couldn't come back! 
FREDDY Is that true?  Then she told you all about me, huh? Let's see what else she has to say. 
Freddy reaches his left hand into the bubbling tar at his feet, digs around a bit, then pulls out: 
ALICE.  Jacob's mother.  Tar dripping down her body.  Krueger has her by the neck, waves his blades in front of her.  Jacob gets up and runs toward him. 
Freddy pulls a foot up from the asphalt pit and KICKS Jacob back a good fifteen feet. 
ALICE Run, Jacob! 
The boy rolls painful on the hard road.  He sits up and screams: 
JACOB Leave her alone! 
FREDDY You're such a momma's boy! 
Freddy swings his knives out, pauses for a terrifying beat, then swoops the daggers towards Alice. 
CLOSE ON JACOB 
as OFF SCREEN we hear a horrible multiple GLITCH!  Jacob shrieks in gut-wrenching anguish. 
WIDE ON SCENE 
We're far enough away so that we don't barf at the sight but close enough to see that Freddy has impaled Alice's body on his blades.  He lifts her up effortlessly and raises her limp figure RIGHT OVER HIS HEAD. 
Krueger swings his arm out, shaking off Alice, sending her flying over Jacob's head.  The body lands behind him. 
ON JACOB 
as he runs to his mother.  She VANISHES just as he reaches out to touch her bloody body.  He turns to Krueger and raises his fists.  A look of sheer rage is growing in him, blind, insane anger.  He bellows: 
JACOB You fucker! 
FREDDY Springwood is only the beginning.  All I need from you is a ride! 
Suddenly, between Jacob and Freddy, three SHAFTS OF LIGHT burst up from the road.  Three FIGURES appear as the light dissipates. 
They're dressed in metallic black, heavy boots, helmets with dark visors covering their faces.  One is large and muscular. The one in the center has an obviously feminine figure under her skin-tight outfit.  The third is a little smaller than the other two with a slightly different face  that allows us to see his mouth. 
They're the DREAM POLICE.  Jacob doesn't know this yet, but Freddy seems to.  The bastard son of a hundred maniacs frowns at the sight of these new apparitions. 
Then he looks past them and smiles at Jacob. 
FREDDY (cont'd) See ya later! 
Freddy violently DROPS down into the bubbling asphalt pit. Two of the black figures start after him.  The third one turns to Jacob as his partners leap into the hole after Freddy.  The sound from his exposed mouth is DEAFENING! 
SOUND COP WAKE UP! 
Jacob grabs his ears in pain as we suddenly: 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY 
Jacob's eyes snap open so fast his sockets suffer whiplash. He's lying smack in the middle of the road tucked in a fetal position.  Jacob slowly uncurls his body and sits up.  He shivers and wipes his sweaty forehead - and that's when he notices something in his hand. 
INSERT: JACOB'S HAND 
it's a bracelet, a simple band of gold with a larger plate in the middle, like an ID band.  Jacob's fingers turn the plate over. Printed on the other side is the name of the bracelet's former owner: ALICE.  Jacob has a souvenir.

INT. FIELD HOSPITAL. NIGHT 
Inman sits on the ground beside Oakley's cot. Around them, the wounded are certainly dying, makeshift care, oil lights, groans. 
OAKLEY I'd like to hear some music while I go. 
EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. NIGHT 
Inman walks around the campfires. He hears some fiddle music. It's Stobrod. 
Stobrod sees Inman. Inman stares, his expression an instruction, the turns and walks away. 
INT. FIELD HOSPITAL. NIGHT 
Stobrod stands over Oakley. Consults with Inman. 
STOBROD What about Bonaparte's Retreat? That's one I play. 
OAKLEY Play me something sweet. Like a girl's waiting for me. 
Stobrod looks at Inman, confused. 
OAKLEY Play me something like there's nothing to fear from a merciful Lord. 
INMAN (to Stobrod) You heard him. 
STOBROD (nervous) I only know a couple of tunes. 
OAKLEY Like when you're thirsty up at Bishop's Creek and the water is so cool. 
Inman glares at Stobrod. And Stobrod starts to play. 
Hesitant, then with gathering confidence, improvising, increasingly expansive, as if he's as surprised as everyone else. Oakley's lips move. A whisper. Inman leans in. 
OAKLEY I'm reaching Cold Mountain before you. 
Stobrod plays. It's wrenching. Oakley stills. Inman abruptly puts his hand on the neck of the fiddle, stopping Stobrod. The boy is dead. Inman gets to his feet and walks away. 
INT. CONFEDERATE TENT. NIGHT 
A dozen men in the tent. Inman has a BOOK, its cover gone, rolled up and tied with a leather strap. His bookmark is A FADED TINTYPE PHOTOGRAPH of a solemn young woman. He unwraps the book carefully and reads a page by the sickly light next to his bedroll. An OFFICER comes into the tent, approaches Inman, who makes a stand. 
OFFICER Don't get up, soldier. You are mentioned tonight in my report. You are a credit to the Highlands, to North Carolina and to the Cause. 
INMAN (tight) Do you have news, sir, on my application for transfer? 
OFFICER I know. A bloody day. It's what our General said: Good thing war is so terrible else a man might end up liking it too much. 
INMAN Sir. It was my understanding the medical corps was desperate for volunteers. 
OFFICER Right now, soldier, it's me who is in need of volunteers. There's a dozen Yankees in that stand of trees between us. Stuck there from the retreat. Come daylight they can shoot us down for sport. 
EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. NIGHT 
A beautiful night. Lots of stars. Inman and three others, including Butcher, slide over the top of the trench, far to one side of the stand of trees. The plan is to cast a wide arc that will bring them around back of the trees, closer to the enemy side than their own. The four men slither over the ground. They pause. Inman has arrived at a tangle of corpses. 
He slithers over them. 
They work their way towards the trees. THERE ARE A HALF DOZEN FEDERALS CROUCHING IN THE COVER OF THE TREES. They are dozing. Only one of them sits with a rifle surveying the Confederate lines, the others have their backs to the enemy, sitting against the trunks, grabbing a few minute's sleep. 
As the four rebels approach, still crawling, one of the Federals opens his eyes, sees the attack, shifts for his rifle. INMAN IMMEDIATELY STANDS UP, FIRING INSTANTLY, killing him and two others, while Butcher throws himself at another. 
The exchanges are brief and savage and one of Inman's party and all of the Federals lay dead. Then the rebels break from the trees. 
A FLARE goes up, then another, both from the Confederate trenches. INMAN AND HIS ACCOMPLICES ARE PICKED OUT IN A BRILLIANT GREEN LIGHT. Shots follow, from both sides, aimed at the three returning men as they zigzag towards their own lines. As they get close, voices cry out, rippling down the trench, joining their own admonitions: Don't shoot, Hold your fire, they're our boys, Hold your fire!!! They're almost home. Butcher is laughing, whooping. Then just as suddenly he falls, wounded. Inman stops, turns back, runs to him. 
Inman collects Butcher, drags him, carries him. They're fifty yards from their lines. A BULLET CATCHES INMAN IN THE NECK. 
He goes down like a tree, blood pouring from his neck. Lying on the ground, he watches the phosphorescent lights slowly fade to black, all sound fading with them. 
EXT. CHAPEL, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. 3 YEARS EARLIER. DAY 
A WOODEN JOIST swings across the view of the Blue Ridge. Men are swarming over the roof of an unfinished CHAPEL, below which appears the small town of COLD MOUNTAIN. Among the workers, armed with nails and hammer, knees clutching a rafter, is Inman, fresh and a whole lifetime younger. Rourke and Butcher are also there hammering, building, kidding around and Oakley, barely a teenager. 
Below them, women are setting up a lunch for the workers, ADA amongst them. She has the circumspect air of the blue stocking, uncomfortably aware of the dirt beneath her hem, the men's radar for her every move. Inman watches her as Sally Swanger approaches. 
SALLY (to Ada, as Monroe moves off) Ada, how are you settling in? Are you liking the farm? 
ADA Very much. It's beautiful country. 
SALLY So listen -- if you would say hello to one of these fools, I'll get a field cleared this weekend. 
ADA Anyone? Like a forfeit? 
SALLY (pointing at Inman who immediately looks away) No. Him in particular, up in the rafters. Been pressing me all morning. 
UP ON THE ROOFBEAMS OF THE CHAPEL, the men are preoccupied with talk of secession from the Union.

DR. PARNASSUS (smiling) Yes? 
MR NICK stubs out his cigarette. 
MR NICK I tell you what... You're probably not a betting man but... 
MR NICK whispers into the DR. PARNASSUS's ear. 
DR. PARNASSUS (V.O.) And so I made a wager with the devil. 
21   EXT   ON THE ROAD (MIDDLE AGES)    DAY/NIGHT               21 
DR. PARNASSUS and PERCY are travelling the world with a little theatre. Giving performances. Inviting AUDIENCE MEMBERS onto the stage to participate. 
DR. PARNASSUS (V.O.) Whichever of us won ten converts first, would win the bet... My argument was the importance of the story, the power of the imagination... His, the power of material things, the supremacy of stuff... Naturally... I won. 
CUT TO another performance. Now the 16TH CENTURY. 
DR. PARNASSUS (V.O. (CONT'D) My prize... (a voice filled with horror) ... was ever-lasting life. 
Another show...now the 18TH CENTURY 
(CONTINUED) 
21   CONTINUED:                                                   21 
DR. PARNASSUS (V.O.) (CONT'D) Everlasting torment... Everlasting... Everlasting... Times changed. No one wanted our tales any longer. 
22   EXT.   MODERN CITY STREET     DAY                             22 
DR. PARNASSUS and PERCY are performing on a street corner in modern clothes. As are all the PASSERSBY who pay them no attention. 
They look exhausted, like beggars...and very old. 
DR. PARNASSUS (V.O.) It seemed as though the Devil, after all... had triumphed... And then... one day.... 
A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN (played by the same actress as Valentina, but older with different coloured hair) comes into view. 
DR. PARNASSUS (V.O.) (CONT'D) From the very first moment I saw her, I was head-over-heels in love. She was beautiful, enchanting, delightful, young... But I... I was several thousand years old! How could I woo her? What could I do? 
23   EXT.   CLIFF TOP    EVENING                                   23 
CUT TO a desolate cliff top where PERCY is struggling with DR PARNASSUS, trying to prevent him from throwing himself off the cliff. 
PERCY Don't be a fool! You can't die! You're immortal! You'll just end up broken, in the eternity ward, and I'll be stuck looking after you! Forever! 
DR. PARNASSUS breaks free, stumbles backwards, and pitches out into space. PERCY screams. 
DR. PARNASSUS V.O. At times like these... the devil is never far away. 
(CONTINUED) 
23   CONTINUED:                                               23 
DR. PARNASSUS is hanging by his coat, snagged on a branch angled out from the cliff face and held, like a fishing rod, by MR NICK who has a great grin on his face. 
24   EXT.   RIVER      DAY                                     24 
CUT TO a much younger DR. PARNASSUS and the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN in a row boat, picnicking, as they float down a river. They are in love, very happy to be together. 
PERCY, wearing a blazer, flannels and straw boater is rowing or punting. 
DR. PARNASSUS (V.O.) The devil granted me mortality again...and youth and great powers. I won my bride. I was in love. But at what price... 
The boat bumps into a submerged log. DR. PARNASSUS tries to push free. Several cigarette butts float past. Looking up, DR. PARNASSUS sees a man sitting on the riverbank, fishing, smoking a cigarette. It's MR NICK . 
There is a loud and ominous clap of thunder. 
25   INT.   PARNASSUS' DEN        NIGHT                        25 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS ...at what price.... 
DR. PARNASSUS looks haggard. He closes his eyes. He sways and drops the paper-weight. 
VALENTINA Father!... 
At that moment the wagon lurches to a stop and we hear frantic banging on the roof. 
DR PARNASSUS is glad of the excuse not to go on. 
DR. PARNASSUS We've stopped. 
VALENTINA What do you mean `at what price'? 
(CONTINUED) 
25   CONTINUED:                                                    25 
DR. PARNASSUS (turning back to his Tarot cards) It'll wait, it'll wait. Another time. Something's happened. You'd better go and see. 
VALENTINA Typical! You insist I listen to a story and then you don't finish it! 
More banging from above. 
DR. PARNASSUS Go and see!

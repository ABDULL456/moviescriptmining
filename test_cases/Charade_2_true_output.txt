MARINE You might try the Treasury Department, ma'am -- Room 216, second floor, Mr. Cruikshank. 
REGGIE Cruikshank, 216. Thank you, Marine. 
INT. EMBASSY CORRIDOR -- DAY 
Featuring a door marked "216." REGGIE and ADAM appear. 
ADAM Do you mind if I wait out here? The sight of all that money being given away might make me break out. 
INT. EMBASSY TREASURY OFFICE -- DAY 
A SECRETARY sits behind a desk. She looks up as REGGIE enters. 
REGGIE Mr. Cruikshank, please -- my name is Lampert. 
The SECRETARY picks up her phone and presses a button. 
SECRETARY Mr. Cruikshank, a Miss -- 
REGGIE Mrs. 
SECRETARY -- a Mrs. Lampert to see you -- yes sir. (to REGGIE) Go right in. 
REGGIE goes to the door leading to the private office. 
INT. CRUIKSHANK'S OFFICE -- DAY 
Featuring the door as REGGIE enters. She stops suddenly. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Featuring the desk. Behind it sits ADAM (now CRUIKSHANK). 
REGGIE stares at him, unbelievingly, then looks around, confused. By way of explanation he indicates the door to the hall. 
REGGIE (blowing up) Well, of all the mean, rotten, contemptible, crooked -- 
CRUIKSHANK Crooked? I should think you'd be glad to find out I wasn't crooked. 
REGGIE You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something? 
CRUIKSHANK We're not allowed to tell. May I have the stamps, please? 
REGGIE (reaching into her bag) Here -- (hesitating) Wait a minute -- how did Carson Dyle get an office in here, anyway? 
CRUIKSHANK When did you see him -- what time, I mean? 
REGGIE Around one. 
CRUIKSHANK The lunch hour. He probably worked it out in advance. He found an office that was usually left open and just moved in for the time you were here. 
REGGIE Then how do I know this is your office? 
CRUIKSHANK (picking up the phone) Mrs. Foster -- send a memo to Bartholomew at Security recommending that -- 
REGGIE Bartholomew? 
CRUIKSHANK -- recommending that all Embassy offices be locked during the lunch hour. 
REGGIE Starting with his own. 
CRUIKSHANK (hanging up) Okay, now -- hand over those stamps. 
REGGIE What's your first name today? 
CRUIKSHANK Brian. 
REGGIE Brian Cruikshank -- it would serve me right if I got stuck with that one. 
CRUIKSHANK Who asked you to get stuck with any of them? 
REGGIE Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank? 
CRUIKSHANK Yes. 
REGGIE But you're -- divorced? 
CRUIKSHANK No. 
REGGIE (crestfallen) Oh. 
CRUIKSHANK My mother -- she lives in Detroit. Come on now -- give me those stamps. 
REGGIE Only if you can prove to me that you're really Brian Cruikshank. 
CRUIKSHANK How about if next week some time I put it on a marriage license -- that ought to -- 
REGGIE Quit stalling -- I want to see some identification -- now! 
CRUIKSHANK I wouldn't lie on a thing like that -- I could go to jail. 
REGGIE You'd lie about anything. 
CRUIKSHANK Well, maybe we'd better forget about it, then. 
REGGIE You can't prove it, can you? You're still trying to -- (the coin drops into the slot) marriage license! Did you say -- ? 
CRUIKSHANK I didn't say anything. Will you give me those stamps? 
REGGIE You did too say it -- I heard you. Oh, I love you Adam -- I mean Alex -- er, Peter -- Brian. I hope we have lots of boys -- we can name them all after you. 
CRUIKSHANK Before we start on that, do you mind handing over the stamps? 
FADE OUT: 
THE END 
BONUS ITEM -- Lyrics to the theme song of the film: 
CHARADE 
Music by Henry Mancini, Words by Johnny Mercer 
When we played our Charade we were like children posing, Playing at games, acting out names, guessing the parts we played. 
Oh, what a hit we made. We came on next to closing Best on the bill, lovers until love left the masquerade. 
Fate seemed to pull the strings, I turned and you were gone.

PINHEAD No more deals, Kirsty. It's your flesh we want to experience, not your skill at bargaining. 
KIRSTY No deals! Just information. Information. Free of charge. No strings. Just information. 
PINHEAD Go on. But trick us again, child, and your suffering will be legendary even in Hell. 
Carefully, making no fast movements, KIRSTY reaches into her pocket where she placed the photograph from MALAHIDE's OBSESSION ROOM. She brings out the picture that she realized earlier was of PINHEAD and hands it to him. 
He takes hold of it and looks, his face registering nothing. 
PINHEAD What is this? Someone else you think escaped us, like Frank? 
KIRSTY No, No, this one didn't escape. You told me you'd always been in Hell. You were wrong. Look at it. LOOK. IT'S YOU. 
PINHEAD Nonsense, I... 
KIRSTY It's you! You HAVEN'T always been as you are. You were HUMAN. Remember. Remember all your confusions. Think! 
The FEMALE CENOBITE strides across the room. 
FEMALE CENOBITE Enough! 
She raises her hand towards KIRSTY. PINHEAD's arm flies out and stops her. 
PINHEAD Wait! 
He is staring at the photograph, that great immobile brow finally puckering, as if something is stirring. 
PINHEAD I...remember. 
KIRSTY You were ALL human! 
The other three CENOBITES stop moving and stare at KIRSTY. Any advances they were making on KIRSTY or TIFFANY stop as the same dim, distant, recollection begins to stir within them. 
Suddenly, the door bursts open. MALAHIDE is there, still floating, his voice still a mixture of hideous threat and insane joy. 
MALAHIDE Tiffany. Come. 
He turns his palms downwards, mirroring his gesture in the hall of mirrors. 
TIFFANY lets out a moan of terror and shakes her head. 
One of the snake-like limbs from MALAHIDE's palms flies towards TIFFANY's face. Before anybody can react, its scalpel tip has sliced an inch or so off several strands of her hair. 
MALAHIDE Tiffany. Come. 
KIRSTY throws her arms around the cowering TIFFANY and snarls at her tormentor. 
KIRSTY Leave her alone, you asshole! 
MALAHIDE makes no reply, but suddenly several more limbs fly towards the GIRLS and begin to weave in front of KIRSTY's face like snakes awaiting their moment. 
At this stage, the camera CUTS TO the watching PINHEAD. He lets the photograph of his past life flutter to the floor. 
MALAHIDE looks up at the tiny noise this makes and his eyes meet PINHEAD'S. He turns more fully to face PINHEAD and the other CENOBITES who are now standing with their leader, and a strange smile crosses his face 
MALAHIDE Oh,good. A fight. 
Suddenly, the air is full of flying chains. MALAHIDE is hooked everywhere. It is like a high-speed version of FRANK's final re- capture in HELLRAISER. The chains start tugging almost instantly. 
Is MALAHIDE about to be ripped apart? 
With contemptuous, dismissive speed, the limbs that ooze from MALAHIDE's palms have sliced the chains to pieces and, almost before we have time to realise that, three of them have lengthened, thickened, and hardened and have skewered the FEMALE CENOBITE, CHATTERER II, and BUTTERBALL to the walls. 
The three limbs detatch themselves from MALAHIDE. The three CENOBITES are all well above the floor, pinned and twitching like the rats in FRANK's attic. 
As they die, they suddenly revert; there are three human corpses on the walls of the room. A woman, a fat man, and a little boy. 
MALAHIDE smiles. Be looks at PINHEAD again and advances. Suddenly a heavy torture pillar smashes into him, knocking him slightly off-balance. 
PINHEAD is backing across the room, weaving pillars in front of him as he moves. MALAHIDE moves forward, knocking them out of the way. As each pillar is knocked aside, PINHEAD's face is more and more human. Finally, when the face we see is nearly that of the ENGLISH OFFICER from the opening, he turns his head slightly away from the advancing MALAHIDE and finds KIRSTY's eyes. A look passes between them. Understanding? Gratitude? Friendship?

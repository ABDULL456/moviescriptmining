DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - PENTAGON BLDG. - DAY 
Seated at a conference table are high-ranking officers of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps. There is the uneasy tension of people dealing with unknown forces. An Army Major General, who's Chairman of the meeting, is speaking. 
GENERAL --as far as we can tell, all power's been cut off everywhere -- with a few exceptions: hospitals, planes in flight -- that sort of thing. I wish I could be more specific but, as you now, all communications are out telephone, radio, cable -- everything. (gravely) I can tell you that the President is prepared to declare a state of national emergency. (pausing to let this sink in) Before we start discussing plans, I want a report from Colonel Ryder. What about the robot, Colonel? 
Ryder is a Colonel of engineers, a man about forty-five. 
COLONEL RYDER When it was discovered last night that the robot had moved, I was directed by the Joint Chiefs to find a means of immobilizing him. We accomplished that this morning by encasing him in a block of KL 93. (he hands a small block of plastic to the General) It's a new plastic material -- stronger than steel. 
GENERAL Is it possible that he's broken out of this stuff? 
COLONEL No, sir. I've Just checked on that. He's locked up tight as a drum. 
GENERAL All right -- that means we concentrate on the man. (to the group with force and authority) Up till now we've agreed on the desirability of capturing this man alive. We can no longer afford to be so particular. We'll get him alive, if possible -- but we must get him! (eyes the group sternly) Is that clear? 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. JEWELRY SHOP - MED. CLOSE SHOT - TOM AND JEWELER 
The shop and its glittering display cases, which were brilliantly lighted in the previous scene, are now gloomy and dim. All artificial light is off. The Jeweler is a bright- eyed old man of seventy with a middle European accent. He is completely fascinated as he examines the diamond Tom has given him, and is annoyed by the lack of light. He speaks impatiently to one of the girls in the shop who happens to pass by. 
JEWELER Eleanor, did you call the electrician? 
GIRL (she's not too bright) I tried, Mr. Bleeker. But the phone doesn't work, either. 
JEWELER (absently, as he studies the stone) Well, call the phone company. 
GIRL (plaintively) But the phone doesn't work. 
The Jeweler gives her a preoccupied glance of annoyance and turns back to the stone. 
TOM Is it worth anything? 
JEWELER I have never seen such a stone. Will you please tell me where it came from? 
TOM That's what I wanted you to tell me. 
JEWELER (overwhelmed and absorbed by the stone, he shakes his head, bewildered) There are no diamonds like this -- any place in the world. 
Impressed by the import of what the man is saying, Tom's mind is racing wildly. 
TOM You sure about that? 
JEWELER (eagerly, shrewdly) Would you like to sell it? 
TOM (picking up the stone) No -- no, thanks. 
JEWELER I'd give you a very good price. 
Preoccupied with his own excited thoughts, Tom has already started for the door. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. ELEVATOR - TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND HELEN 
In the dim light of the stalled elevator, Klaatu is finishing explaining to Helen the story of his mission. Overwhelmed by the staggering import of what he has told her, Helen is listening with great interest and concern. 
KLAATU (speaking gravely) --I've already told you more than I told Professor Barnhardt, because my life, in a sense, is in your hands. I thought if you knew the facts you'd appreciate the importance of my not being -- apprehended, -- before the meeting tonight. 
Helen is staring at him in awe, but also in complete admiration and sympathy. 
HELEN Yes, of course. Of course I do. 
Klaatu smiles at her warmly and she manages to return the smile. Their relationship is further cemented by the sharing of this vital secret. 
HELEN (studying his face anxiously) You hold great hope for this meeting. 
KLAATU I can see no other hope for your planet. If the meeting should fail, then I'm afraid there is no hope. 
Suddenly and without warning, the elevator starts moving and the lights go on. Startled, Helen looks at him. 
KLAATU (calmly) It must be twelve-thirty.

The Winged Beast starts to charge them when suddenly-- 
7 DROPS DOWN from a high parapet and leaps onto the Winged Beast's neck. 
and 8 stare in surprise.   9 stares in delight and relief. 
(stunned and surprised) 
mmediately, the beast throws her off towards the others. She'd dropped her spear; she goes to pick it up and 
PFFFFFFT> immediately, her leg is IMPALED by the Winged Beast, which has fired its harpoon. She is impaled next to the guys. 
(LIGHTLY) I thought you might need some help. 
But as she speaks, the Beast begins to reel her in.       She fights viciously. 
jumps and grabs on to 7 as she's being pulled away. 
7 (CONT'D) (YELLING) My spear! 
grabs her forked spear and hands it to her. She grabs her forked spear and stabs it into the plane.   The harpoon's cable is pulled taut 9 between her leg and the Winged Beast. 
(yelling to the others) The cable! Cut it! 
8 runs to recover the blade that slipped from his grasp as he slid down the roof, then runs over and SLICES with all his brute force through the cable. The cable flies up in the air and WRAPS itself around the propeller on the end of the wing. 
The Winged Beast jerks back, towards the propeller, causing the whole wing of the plane to tilt, and the ragdolls to slide. 5 and 6 tumble into the plane's engine room. 
A 
7 clutches her staff. 9 slides by her and grabs on to the harpoon, still lodged in her leg. 
9's staff slides by, and 9 catches it just before it falls off the wing. As 8 climbs up onto the same buttress fragment that 7's spear is lodged in, 1 slides down the wing, past 9. 9 (CONT'D) (to 1; holding out his STAFF) Grab on! 
1 grabs 9's staff. Dangling, he sees that the Winged Beast is close behind, snapping at him with its beak. 
9 sees 5 and 6 in the engine room. 
9 (CONT'D) (shouting to 5) The propeller! Start the propeller! 
6 nods. 5 points to the wires. 5 and 6 gather wires and set to work. They ZAP the propeller to life and it GROANS... then whines into motion as it starts taking up the power it had generated. It goes faster... faster... 
Even as the Beast is slowly drawn towards the propeller, it struggles forward and grabs 1's cape in its beak. 
As the Winged Beast pulls 1 closer, 9 strains to hang on to 1, and 7 strains with the added weight on the harpoon sticking out of her wounded leg. 
My... my cape! 
Let it go! 
1 glares furiously, hesitates, then undoes the clasp. The Winged Beast falls backwards down the wing, DIRECTLY INTO THE DEADLY BLADES. 
It is instantly shredded. 
Claws, feathers, and strange mechanical debris shower down. 
, 9, and 7 look in relief as the Beast is finally destroyed. 
fter the clasp is released, 1 has meanwhile recoiled into 9's arms. There is a brief moment of awkwardness as 1 and 9 realize how close they are physically to each other.

ROGER PENROSE (CONT'D) The star, in fact, gets denser as atoms--even subatomic particles-- get literally crushed, smashed into smaller and smaller space. And at its end point what are we left with? 
He draws a point. 
ROGER PENROSE (CONT'D) A point. A spacetime singularity... 
STEPHEN is captivated. 
ROGER PENROSE (CONT'D) With extraordinary properties! Infinite density. Space and time come to a stop. All of the known laws of science--they just stop working. (MORE)

CONTINUED: (2) ROGER PENROSE (CONT'D) What I've just shown is that this happens in every black hole. Its really happening, out there. To real stars--and its happening right now! 
STEPHEN smiles - seeing his future revealed. 
INT. MOVING TRAIN COMPARTMENT - NIGHT 
SCIAMA and his students, returning home. 
As his friends talk excitedly, STEPHEN is silently staring down at the CIRCULATING COFFEE in front of him, into which he pours CREAM... 
SLOWLY, CLOCKWISE - the cream is spread outward by the circulating coffee until it looks like a SPIRAL GALAXY. 
As he stares, deep in thought, the SPIRAL of CREAM pulses with LIGHT - he is having an epiphany here - a major insight... 
...and then TIME GOES INTO REVERSE. As it does so, the CREAM CHANGES DIRECTION, goes ANTI-CLOCKWISE now, the SPIRAL once more returning to its original central dollop, and then vanishing. The coffee creamless. STEPHEN looks up... 
STEPHEN (TO SCIAMA) I wonder what would happen--if--I wonder what would happen-- 
Sensing his protege is on to something, perhaps even a small smile. 
SCIAMA Go on. If? 
STEPHEN If you applied Penrose's theory about black holes to--the entire universe? 
SCIAMA stares at him. 
EXT. RIVERBANK, CAMBRIDGE - SUNSET 
STEPHEN excitedly expands on his new idea to a DELIGHTED, SMILING JANE as they WALK side by side. 
(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   25 
CONTINUED: 
STEPHEN If--if--so--If--Einstein is right, if--general relativity is correct, then the universe is expanding, yes? - 
JANE - Alright - 
STEPHEN - which means - that--if you reverse time, the universe would get smaller and smaller. So what if--if I reverse the process all the way to see what happened at the beginning of Time itself? The universe, smaller and smaller, denser and denser, hotter and hotter as we approach its birth. Wind back the clock... 
JANE grabs his hands and begins to SWIRL him around. 
STEPHEN (CONT'D) What are you doing? 
JANE Winding back the clock! 
STEPHEN (LAUGHING) Is that what you're doing? 
JANE That's what I'm doing. 
STEPHEN Well keep winding! You've got quite a way to go. Keep winding, Jane! Keep winding...back to the beginning of Time...Keep winding... 
They SPIN faster and faster until they almost trip and only save themselves by clasping each other closely... 
STEPHEN (CONT'D) (SUDDENLY SERIOUS) ...until you get - 
INT. SCIAMA'S OFFICE/DAMTP, CAMBRIDGE - DAY 
STEPHEN at the blackboard makes a DOT on the blackboard. 
SCIAMA A singularity. 
(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   26 
CONTINUED: 
STEPHEN A spacetime singularity. At the beginning of time.

Viko and Zlata wait... then breathe relief. They won. Viko turns TO THE BACK OF THE COURTROOM: Kathy smiles, at last feeling they can really accomplish something. 
43   INT. JAN'S OFFICE - ILIDZA STATION - DAY                      43 
Kathy comes inside, interrupting Jan and FRANZ, Dutch IPTF. TWB 21. 
KATHY Sorry, you wanted to see me? 
Franz excuses himself, eyeing a tense Kathy. Jan closes the door behind Franz, turning to Kathy. All business. 
JAN Madeleine Rees wants to see you. Head of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. 
KATHY What? Why? 
JAN I'm sure it's fine. You followed protocol, right? 
Kathy rushes out, worried. Jan smiles, in on a secret. 
44   INT. MADELEINE REES' OFFICE - SARAJEVO - MORNING               44 
Kathy sits alone in the office. Degrees, plaques, and awards cover the walls. Pictures of Madeleine Rees with Kofi Annan, Bill Clinton, Nelson Mandela... Kathy is intimidated. 
MADELEINE REES, 50s, tall, commanding, short blonde hair, British. She sashays in with a DOBERMAN on a leash. 
MADELEINE REES Don't mind Helen, she's a total sap. 
Kathy eyes the malevolent hound. 
KATHY Ms. Rees, I-- 
MADELEINE REES Madeleine. You've been stirring things up. 
KATHY Is this about Zlata Sehik? If I've overstepped protocol-- 
MADELEINE REES You have done in two months, what we've been trying to do for years. 
Madeleine sits. Kathy straightens. TWB 22. 
MADELEINE REES (CONT'D) All due respect to Viko Mezovic, but you just facilitated the first conviction for domestic abuse in Bosnian history. I'm bloody impressed. So is the Dutch Duty Officer who recommended you. 
Kathy takes it in. Madeleine looks out the window at TWO GLASS TOWERS that punctuate Sarajevo's skyline. 
MADELEINE REES (CONT'D) The IPTF has a Gender Affairs Office at Mission Headquarters. Dervla Hughes, the current head, is leaving and I think you're the right person to take over. 
Kathy is taken aback. 
MADELEINE REES (CONT'D) You'd be overseeing 12 regional offices. Any gender reports come through you. This involves anything from equality training to domestic and child abuse cases, fallout from war crimes against women, prostitution. Women in Bosnia are treated like second class citizens. You could have a real impact on their lives. What do you think? Are you interested? 
This is everything Kathy came to do... 
KATHY Absolutely. 
45   INT. BEDROOM - IPTF DORM - NIGHT                            45 
Kathy paces, phone to her ear. Her suitcase open, she's packing at the same time. Carmen helps. 
KATHY (INTO PHONE) I know hon, it's very exciting. If this works out. It's a real opportunity for the future, but it means I have to, I have to extend my contract for another six months... Hello?.. 
Kathy stops pacing. 
KATHY (CONT'D) ...Erin? 
Kathy pulls the phone close, listening. Carmen eyes her. TWB 23. 
KATHY (CONT'D) No I didn't. I'll look right now. 
Kathy goes over to a computer, clicking open an EMAIL. ON THE SCREEN: A PICTURE OF ERIN in a PROM DRESS. Kathy sits back, flushed with emotion. Her enthusiasm complicated by the realization of what she's missing back home. Softly... 
KATHY (CONT'D) You look beautiful... 
46   EXT. AMERICAN APARTMENT COMPLEX - NIGHT                        46 
Carmen helps Kathy load boxes and suitcases into an SUV. 
CARMEN I can't believe they're moving you into the city. I'm so jealous. So where's your office? 
KATHY Mission Headquarters... UNMHQ. 
CARMEN But Madeleine is UNHCHR, right? 
KATHY (smiling) I know. I don't even know if I'm still IPTF. 
CARMEN Well I don't give an F.U.C.K. All I know is I'm gonna miss you. Stay in touch with the little people! 
They hug. Kathy smiles, and hops into the car. 
47   EXT. SARAJEVO ROAD - NIGHT                                     47 
Kathy drives into the CITY CENTRE. 
48   INT. KATHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                 48 
Kathy puts the last box down. She steps out onto the balcony. Looks out at Sarajevo, city of survivors, her new home. 
49   EXT. UN MISSION HEADQUARTERS (UNMHQ) - SARAJEVO - MORNING      49

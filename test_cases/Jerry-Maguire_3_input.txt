Jerry stands in pre-season locker-room.   Off-stage we hear a shower.  In the b.g., one of those locker-room psych-up signs like: Injuries happen first in the mind. 
JERRY I started talking with Dennis Wilburn about your renegotation. 
Rod emerges naked, dripping wet, pissed. 
TIDWELL Did you tell him about the "ten million for four years?" 
JERRY Uh, not today, but -- 
TIDWELL John Taylor.  J.J. Stokes.  Andre Rison.  I SMOKE all these fools, and yet they're making the big sweet dollars. They're making the money, and I got an agent that ain't even put the number on the table. 
JERRY I understand your anxiety. 
TIDWELL Maybe you don't.  Because it's not just the money I deserve.  It's not just the "coin."  It's the... 
He says this next word royally, as if it's fine silk. 
TIDWELL (continuing) --  the kwan. 
JERRY That's your word? 
TIDWELL Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. The package.  The kwan. 
JERRY (impressed) But how did you get "kwan?" 
TIDWELL (irritated) I got there from "coin," dude. Coin, coin... kwaaaan. 
JERRY Great word.  Towel? 
TIDWELL No, I air-dry. 
JERRY Rod, I say this with great respect, but those players you mentioned are marquee players and -- 
A portable phone beeps. 
TIDWELL Is that your porty or mine? 
JERRY You. 
Tidwell rummages in his bag.  Finds one of two porties and answers the one with a Polaroid of Marcee taped to it. 
TIDWELL Hi baby. Yeah, I'm just breakin' in the new agent.  He says I'm not marquee.  I know... I know... 
Tidwell holds up the phone so Jerry can hear the sound of Marcee going off. 
TIDWELL (continuing) My wife is upset with you. 
INT. LOCKER ROOM MIRROR -- DAY 
The conversation continues as Tidwell fixes hair in the mirror. Jerry  speaks  to  the  reflection,  taking  him  on, gesturing passionately.  Tidwell, still naked, may or may not be listening. 
JERRY Here's what I'm saying.  This is a renegotiation.  We want more from them, so let's show them more from us. Let's show them your pure joy of the game, let's bury the Attitude a little, let's show them -- 
TIDWELL (irritated) You're telling me to dance. 
JERRY No, I'm saying to be -- 
He mimes a dainty little showboat-touchdown dance. 
TIDWELL (little voice) "Love me love me love me... put me on t.v." (pissed) That's the iconography of rascism, man! 
JERRY Rod, I'm not a rascist.  I'm telling you to be the best version of you, to get back to the guy who first started playing this game. Way back when you were a kid.  It wasn't just about the money, was it? 
Tidwell gives him a look.  Money was always a factor. 
TIDWELL Do your job, man, don't tell me to dance. 
JERRY Fine. 
He begins gathering his things. 
TIDWELL I'm an athlete, not an entertainer. These are the ABC's of ME.  Get it? I don't dance. 
Jerry rubs face. 
TIDWELL (continuing) What's wrong. 
JERRY Forget it.  Forget it. 
TIDWELL No tell me. 
JERRY I'm out here for you!  You don't know what it's like to be me out here for you. It is an up-at-dawn pride-swallowing seige that I will never fully tell you about! Okay?! Help me help you help me help you. 
TIDWELL You're hanging by a very thin thread, dude.  And I dig that about you. 
Jerry has had enough for one day. 
JERRY (loopy, punch-drunk, arms flailing) Hey.  I'm happy to entertain you! I'll see you in L.A.!

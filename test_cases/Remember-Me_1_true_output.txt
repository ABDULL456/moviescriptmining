Tyler smiles as he takes his journal and exits. 
106   EXT. HOFFMAN FAMILY HOME -- PORCH -- MORNING             106 
Charles waiting on the doorstep, his Town Car waiting on the curb. Diane answers the door expecting to find Caroline's driver, she's confused to find... 
DIANE Charles? 
CHARLES Good morning Diane. 
DIANE What are you doing here? 
CHARLES Tyler's coming by the office, but I thought I'd ride to school with Caroline first. 
Diane is speechless. This is a first. 
DIANE Um...OK...sure...yeah...great. She's not ready though, she's going to need at least twenty minutes. 
Charles hates waiting. 
CHARLES (adjusting his tie) All right. 
107   EXT. SIDEWALK -- LATER                                      107 
Tyler chaining up his bike. His cellphone rings. He checks it. Knows what it's regarding before he answers. 
TYLER Are you canceling all together or are you just running late? 
108   INT. CHARLES' TOWN CAR-- MORNING                            108 
Charles and Caroline in the back seat. She's on one side, with her pink back pack, he's on the other. 
CHARLES (on the phone) Are you already on your way? 
INTERCUT: 
109   EXT. OPEN PLAZA.                                            109 
Tyler rounding a corner. 
TYLER I'm already here. 
CHARLES I'm taking Caroline to school. 
He looks at his daughter. She looks back at him, then looks out the window. 
Tyler considers. 
TYLER Take your time. I'll just wait in your office. 
CHARLES It may be a while. 
TYLER That's okay. 
Tyler hangs up and joins the herds of suits heading down the street. 
110   INT. ELEVATOR -- LATER                                      110 
Tyler riding in a handsome marble and oak elevator with a half-dozen EXECUTIVE types. Tyler steps on and presses the number 92. The doors close. 
111   INT. EXECUTIVE FLOOR -- RECEPTION -- LATER                  111 
Tyler walks, approaches the Receptionist from the ashtray incident. He smiles pleasantly. She doesn't. 
TYLER Janine in? 
THE RECEPTIONIST (cold) She went for coffee. 
TYLER She getting me any? Just kidding. 
Tyler heads down the hall. The Receptionist rolls her eyes. 
112   INT. CHARLES ROTH'S OFFICE -- LATER                         112 
Tyler steps into his father's empty office. It's dark, quiet. He opens the blinds. Sunlight fills the room. 
Tyler walks around the office. Picking things up, putting them back. 
Tyler sits at his father's desk in his executive chair. He leans back. Puts his feet up and his hands behind his head. 
Tyler notices the COMPUTER. He turns on the monitor and puts his hand on the mouse - but doesn't move it. His hand just stops and stays perfectly still. Tyler stares at the monitor where his dad's SCREEN SAVER is scrolling through PHOTOS... 
These photos are all of his FAMILY... "Michael's first Christmas, Tyler's eighth birthday, Diane in the hospital with Caroline in a pink blanket, Charles and his kids build a sand castle at the shore"... they just keep going. 
Tyler finds himself watching a slide show of his life.

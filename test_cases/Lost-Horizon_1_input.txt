CONWAY 
Oh, you speak English, do you? 
MEN 
Yes, sir. 
ONE OF THE MEN 
Would you like to take a ride, Mr. Conway? 
CONWAY 
No, thanks. Not just now. 
Suddenly, Conway is startled by the sound of hoof-beats and, looking up, is in time to see 'the girl' of the previous sequence (Sondra) fly by him on a horse - screaming delightedly. As she passes him, she waves. 
CONWAY 
(instantly changing his mind) 
Well, I think I will take that ride! 
181. MED. SHOT - CONWAY 
As he rides off in pursuit of her. 
182. SEVERAL SHOTS OF THE CHASE 
Showing Sondra successfully eluding him - as he closes in on her. 
183. MED. LONG SHOT - BOTTOM OF A HILL 
Sondra whizzes by. As we stay on the shot - Conway rides through in exciting pursuit. 
184. ANOTHER ANGLE 
Showing Sondra disappearing behind a mountain waterfall. Conway dashes up, but she is lost from sight. He wheels around several times - and unable to find her, looks puzzled. Finally, giving up, he starts slowly back. After a few moments he is startled by her laughter, and glances around. 
185. LONG SHOT 
From his view - shooting upward. High up - near the summit of the hill - we see Sondra - waving and laughing. Then she swings her horse around and disappears. 
186. CLOSEUP - CONWAY 
As he smiles - amused and interested. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
187. LONG SHOT - SONDRA 
As she swims in a mountain stream, apparently in the buff. From a distance, we see her climb onto a rock to dry off. 
188. CLOSEUP - SONDRA 
As she shakes her shimmering hair. 
189. MEDIUM SHOT - CONWAY 
He has caught up to her tethered horse and is skulking around trying to find out where she is. 
190. CLOSE SHOT - A SQUIRREL 
A squirrel, near to Sondra, chatters excitedly. 
191. CLOSE SHOT - SONDRA 
She can apparently understand the squirrel's warning. She hurries to dive back into the water and swim to the other side. She comes up, spots Conway and watches him from hiding, behind some bushes. 
192. MEDIUM SHOT - CONWAY 
Conway has discovered her clothing and is constructing a kind of scarecrow on a bush out of them. As a crowning touch, he adds a flower to the effigy, his eyes twinkling at his little joke. With one final glance over his shoulder, he turns to leave. 
193. CLOSE SHOT - SONDRA 
She stifles her laughter as he vanishes from view. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT 
194. FULL SHOT 
Lovett and Barnard are at the table waiting for the others. Several servants are in the b.g. George paces nervously in front of the door. 
195. MED. SHOT AT TABLE 
Lovett and Barnard. Barnard nibbles at something. 
BARNARD 
Bah! Fossils! Why? What for? Running around digging up a lot of old bones! You didn't dig yourself out of one of those holes by any chance, did you? 
Lovett is about to reply, when he realizes he is being made fun of, and gives a tentative chuckle. 
INT. CORRIDOR 
196. MEDIUM SHOT 
Conway is coming down the corridor. George comes out of door to dining room and starts forward. Conway walks along in a cheerful mood, singing as he goes, a Cockney song. 
GEORGE 
(forces a smile) 
You seem gay. Did you find out anything? 
197. CLOSE TRUCKING SHOT WITH THEM 
As they walk back toward dining room door. 
CONWAY 
Well - I heard that if you want a man's wife, she's yours, if he's got any manners. 
GEORGE 
Nothing about the porters yet? 
CONWAY 
Porters? 
GEORGE 
Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing. 
CONWAY 
Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we? 
GEORGE 
I'm afraid the porters are just a myth. 
(tensely) 
I guess we never will know why we're here, or how long we're going to be held prisoners. 
CONWAY 
Shhh! 
They have reached the door and start into dining room. 
INT. DINING ROOM 
198. MEDIUM SHOT 
As Conway and George enter, Barnard calls to them: 
BARNARD 
Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm starved! 
CONWAY 
(imitating Chang as he takes his chair) 
Please! Please! Do not wait for me! I eat so very little. 
Barnard laughs heartily. George, surily silent, enters and drops in his seat. At the same moment, Gloria comes into the room.

{"train": "ARSENIC AND OLD LACE \nWritten by \nJulius J. & Philip G. Epstein \nAdapted from the play by \nJoseph Kesselring \nCREDITS \nCredits roll, in white letters, on several funny cartoons, all of them about witches and witchcraft (a caldron over a fire, with two witches on either side of it - A close-up of one of the witches - A witches falling down from the sky on her broomstick, and loosing her hat in the fall - A furious black cat spitting at an owl seated on a branch - A carafe with two glasses, actually a direct reference to the film - An Halloween pumpkin pressing her two forefingers in its ears, with music notes around it - Black bats flying over a village). \nBROOKLYN - GENERAL OVERVIEW - EXTERIOR DAY \nA general overview of Brooklyn, near New York, seen from the roof of a very high building. Written in white letters on this overview, the following words : \nThis is a Hallowe'en tale of Brooklyn, where anything can happen-- and it usually does. \nThen : At 3 P.M. on this particular day, this was happening- \nSeveral white circles move on the screen, then the whole screen is covered by a huge base ball, with \u00abBrooklyn\u00bb written on it in black letters. \nBASEBALL GAME - SPECTATORS - EXTERIOR DAY \nClose-up of the face of man, screaming : \nBASEBALL FAN I'll knock your block off, you big stiff ! You're a bum ! \nThe camera moves away, so we can see the other baseball spectators behind the first one. \nBASEBALL FIELD - EXTERIOR DAY \nGeneral view of a baseball field, where a game is being played. Follow several very quick sequences (one or two seconds each) : A general view of the spectators. Then a player throwing a ball. Then a very excited brass band playing. Then a few very excited spectators. Then another player throwing a ball. \nFinally we see a batter missing his ball. We hear the Umpire, standing behind the catcher and heavily covered with a protection suit, yelling : \nTHE UMPIRE Strike ! You're out ! \nThe batter, who missed the ball, drops his bat on the ground and comes back to the Umpire. He tears the Umpire helmet and mask away, and gives him a good punch in the nose. The Umpire falls on the ground. The catcher then hits the batter. The Umpire rises slowly from the ground. \nSeveral very quick sequences : The ball-thrower drops his glove and runs to the fight. Then several excited spectators stand up to join the fight. Several player, who were waiting for their turn to go on the field, also run to the fight. Then a view of the fight, where all the players are hitting each other. Then the popcorn seller, dropping his basket to join the fight. Then spectators jumping over the balustrades to join the fight. Then another view of the players fighting. Then a final view of the Umpire, laying on the field and leaning on one elbow, and quietly munching some food. \nNEW YORK - A BRIDGE - EXTERIOR DAY \nWe see a large view of a bridge with a white boat passing underneath. Written in large white letters on the screen, the words : \nWhile at the same time across the river in the UNITED STATE PROPER there was a romance in the air. \nMARRIAGE LICENSE BUREAU - INTERIOR DAY \nClose-up on the sign \u00abMARRIAGE LICENSE BUREAU\u00bb, with people passing underneath. \nAN EXCITED GIRL VOICE Elmer, here it is. \nA MORE QUIET MALE VOICE I knew you'd find it. \nANOTHER MALE VOICE Boy, I could sure use a drink. \nThe camera gets down from the sign to floor level. Two journalists are approaching, one equipped with a camera. \nTHE PHOTOGRAPHER I wonder if any big shots are getting married today ? They stop at the door of the room. \nLarger view of the room, where several people are, either standing in a queue, either sitting at a table and filling forms, either chatting in groups of two or three \nBack to the two journalists still standing a the door. \nTHE OTHER JOURNALIST Looks like the same suckers get married every day. \nHe looks around for a few second, then starts to move away. \nTHE OTHER JOURNALIST Come on. \nThe photographer makes him come back. He points to someone in the room. \nTHE PHOTOGRAPHER Hey, the guy with the cheaters. \nIn a line of people queueing in front of a counter, we see Mortimer Brewster, with a hat and a pair of large dark glasses. He turns around and notices the two journalists looking at him. He raises the collar of his black coat to try to hide his face. The girl in front of him turns around to look at him. She has blonde curly hair and wears a hat with a strange white feather. She is Elaine Harper. With both his hands, Mortimer turns her face back toward the counter. \nBack to the two journalists at the door of the room. \nTHE OTHER JOURNALIST Now what's he hiding from ? \nHe starts moving to get a better look at Mortimer. Mortimer moves in front of Elaine, who smiles. \nThe two journalists are now in the room, and they look at Mortimer. \nTHE OTHER JOURNALIST Hey, isn't that Mortimer Brewster? \nTHE PHOTOGRAPHER Mortimer Brewster, the dramatic critic ? \nMortimer looks very embarrassed. \nBack to the two journalists. \nTHE OTHER JOURNALIST No, it's not him. But what a scoop it would be ! The guy who wrote The Bachelor's Bible finally getting hooked himself. Nope. It's too good to be true. Come on, let's snap the mayor in his new fire helmet and go home. THE PHOTOGRAPHER Hey, let's stick around, and see who the guy is. \nBack to the line of people waiting in front of the counter. The marriage clerk is standing behind a set of metal bars. A couple of people leaves the counter. It's now Mortimer and Elaine's turn. The marriage clerk sings : \nTHE CLERK \"Two by two they come and go. Hip hip hig hay !\" \nHe smiles to Mortimer and Elaine. \nTHE CLERK Good morning, children. Your name, please ? \nELAINE Elaine Harper. \nShe spoke in a very soft voice. The clerk put his hand around his ear. THE CLERK Speak a little louder. \nShe speaks louder. \nELAINE Elaine Harper. \nTHE CLERK Thank you. Yours ? \nMortimer comes very close to the bars above the counter and whispers. \nMORTIMER Mortimer Brewster. The clerk puts his hand back around his ear. \nThe two journalists are straining their own ears to be able to understand Mortimer's name \nO'HARA Well... So long, Colonel. \nTeddy looks at him and then looks at Brophy, who doesn't salute him. O'Hara elbows his Sargent with the arm which is saluting. \nO'HARA Hey, Sarge. \nBROPHY Hey ? \nBrophy looks at Teddy and understands the situation. He also salutes Teddy. \nBROPHY Oh, yes. \nTeddy salutes them. \nTEDDY Dismissed ! \nBrophy and O'Hara bring their arms down. \nBROPHY Well, goodbye and thank you. ABBY Good bye. \nAbby opens the front door. The two cops start going out, Brophy first. \nABBY Careful of the step here now with the toys. \nBROPHY Good night. \nO'Hara goes out, and then comes one step back and shows his face behind the door. He winks to Teddy. Teddy raises his eyebrows. \nTEDDY Young man, let that be a lesson to you. \nO'Hara chuckles, then makes a strange face, and goes out. \nABBY Goodbye. She closes the door, and goes back to her sister and Reverend Harper. \nABBY Well... \nREVEREND HARPER Well, I must be going. \nTeddy, still carrying his model warship, starts mounting the stairs, stops after a few steps, takes his imaginary sword out, points it forward and runs upstairs, yelling : \nTEDDY Charge ! \nHe reaches the balcony, turns toward the balustrade and yells. \nTEDDY Charge the blockhouse ! \nHe goes into his room and slams the door behind him. We hear the grandfather's clock chiming once. \nReverend Harper looks up at the balcony, then turns to the Brewster sisters with puzzled eyes. \nREVEREND HARPER Blockhouse ? \nMARTHA Oh, the stairs are always San Juan Hill. \nREVEREND HARPER Oh, I... \nBut Reverend Harper doesn't finish his sentence and sneezes very loudly. He takes his handkerchief out of his pocket to put it under his nose. \nABBY Bless you ! \nREVEREND HARPER Have you ever tried to persuade him he wasn't Teddy Roosevelt ? \nABBY Oh, no ! \nShe goes to the grandfather's clock. \nMARTHA Oh, he's so happy being Teddy Roosevelt. \nAbby moves the minute hand of the clock back in place. \nABBY Oh, do you remember, Martha ? She comes back to her sister and Reverend Harper. \nABBY Once, a long time ago, we thought if he'd be George Washington, it might be a change for him, and we suggested it. \nMARTHA And do you know what happened ? He just stayed under his bed for days and wouldn't be anybody. \nReverend Harper laughs. \nREVEREND HARPER Well, if he's happy, and what's more important, you're happy... \nHe starts walking toward the front door, followed by the Brewster sisters. He reaches the door and opens it. \nMARTHA Oh, our only worry for Teddy is after we are gone. \nThey all go out. \nBREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR DAY \nThe three of them are coming out of the house. \nREVEREND HARPER Yes, indeed. That is quite a problem. \nABBY But Mortimer's made all the arrangements for Teddy to go to Happy Dale Sanitarium after we pass on. \nREVEREND HARPER Splendid idea ! A very pleasant place. \nMARTHA Yes... \nReverend Harper put his hat back on his head, and starts walking toward his own house. \nABBY Dear, sweet Reverend Harper. \nThe two sisters look at him. We see him cross the churchyard and enter his house. \nABBY You know, Martha, I really do believe he's beginning to see the light. \nThey start walking back to the door of their house. \nMARTHA I'm sure we needn't worry about him. He won't interfere with our plans for Mortimer and Elaine. \nBREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nThe two sisters enter their house. Martha closes the door. \nMARTHA Oh, did you just have tea ? \nABBY Yes. And dinner's going to be late, too. \nMARTHA Ohh ! Why ? \nThey both turn their heads toward the stairs, because they just heard Teddy's door slamming. \nBack to the tree. The couple is hidden by the tree. They separate and move a little away from each other, each one of them appearing on either side the tree. \nElaine drags Mortimer by the hand from behind the tree. ELAINE But, Mortimer, you're going to love me for my mind, too ? \nMORTIMER One thing at a time. \nShe starts running away from him. \nELAINE Oh ! There's that look again ! \nMortimer comes slowly from behind the tree, clowning. \nMORTIMER \u00abThere's that look again, Mortimer !\u00bb You better get used to it. \nHe becomes more serious and come closer to her. \nMORTIMER Look like you're going to see it often. It goes just before this. He kisses her very passionately. \nMORTIMER You know what we're doing, darling ? We're wasting time. Look, I'll go tell my aunts and you tell your old... No, you'd better not tell your father just yet. You'll run that cold of his into a pneumonia. \nELAINE Oh, I can handle Father. He's a dear. \nMORTIMER Look, why don't we wire him from Niagara Falls ? \nELAINE Niagara Falls ? \nMortimer nods. \nELAINE Then that's why you stopped at your office. \nMORTIMER Yes, certainly ! We're going to go the whole hog. Niagara Falls ! Everybody ought to go to Niagara Falls. You should've seen my secretary's face when I made the reservation. We've got a drawing-room on the train, the bridal suite in the hotel, and tomorrow morning we go over the falls in a barrel. \nElaine kisses Mortimer very passionately. \nMORTIMER Go on, darling, hurry and pack. \nELAINE I don't have to. I started packing the day after I met you. She starts moving away. He holds her back. \nMORTIMER There, you see ! You see ? That's what I mean. That's what I hate about women. \nMortimer kisses her. \nBack to the cab driver who is pacing in front of his car. He rubs his chin. \nCAB DRIVER I wonder what Mary's doing now ? \nMortimer and Elaine are still kissing. Mortimer lets go of Elaine. He puts her hat on her head. \nMORTIMER Go on, darling, the train leaves in an hour, and hurry. \nELAINE It'll be a few minutes before I'm ready. Father may want to pray over me a little. \nShe moves away. \nMORTIMER Whistle when you're ready. Oh, Elaine... \nShe turns around. \nELAINE Yeah. \nMORTIMER When you whistle, open the front door fast. If you see a tall, dark streak of light, it's me. \nHe starts running toward his aunts' house. Elaine runs to her father's house. \nShe stops at the door of her house and starts whistling. \nMortimer, who had also reached his door, stops and turns around. \nMORTIMER What ? Now ? \nHe starts running toward her, but she stops him. \nELAINE No, not now ! \nShe opens her door. \nBREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nThe two sisters are eagerly waiting for Mortimer. Martha whispers. MARTHA Look surprised when he tells us. \nAbby laughs. They hear a door slamming in the next room. \nMORTIMER (voice over) Aunt Abby, Aunt Martha ! \nMortimer rushes into the room and throws his hat on a chair. \nMORTIMER Hold on to your bustles. We're married. Elaine and I are married. \nThe two sisters hug and kiss Mortimer. \nABBY Oh, darling, how wonderful ! Oh, Martha, isn't it wonderful ? They're married! \nMORTIMER Yeah ! Don't pretend to be so surprised either, you two old frauds. Can I use the telephone, darling ? \nABBY Yes, of course. \nMortimer goes to the telephone, followed by his two aunts. \nABBY Isn't it too, too wonderful ? \nMortimer sits at the small desk on which the telephone is, and whistles while dialing. \nMARTHA And to think that it happened right here in this room ! \nShe dabs her nose with her handkerchief. \nMORTIMER Oh, now, here, here, now ! Hello ?... Hello ? Benson's Florists ? This is Mortimer Brewster. Did you send those roses to Missis Brewster's apartment ?... You did ? Good. Now, send four dozen more to drawing room A, Canadian Limited, Grand Central Station. Yes... And hurry then. And throw in a flock of orange blossoms. \nHe puts the telephone receiver back on his hook, and he turns on his chair to face his aunts, his arms resting on the back of the chair. \nABBY But before you go, we can have our celebration. I'll open a bottle of wine and we'll sing. And we'll invite a few of the neighbors in. \nMARTHA And, of course, a wedding cake. MORTIMER Oh, darling, you won't have time to bake a cake. We're going to Niagara Falls. I've got a taxi waiting. \nABBY Oh, it's all ready. It's been ready since.. \nMORTIMER Yeah, I bet it's been ready since the first day I met her, huh ? \nHe stands up. \nMORTIMER What is it ? Did everybody in Brooklyn know I was getting married, except me ? \nMortimer shows a forced smile. \nThe two sisters puts things on the table, then they come to Mortimer, who is still seated on the window-seat. Abby is carrying a big bowl of rice, and the two girls start throwing rice on him. \nABBY Happy bridegroom ! \nMARTHA Congratulations, darling ! \nMORTIMER Never mind that now. I know. \nMortimer takes the bowl from Abby's hands and put it on a small table. He remains seated while his aunts are standing in front of him. \nMORTIMER Now, listen, darlings. Aunt Abby, Aunt Martha, you know how we've always planned to send Teddy to that Sanitarium, Happy Dale ? \nABBY Oh, yes, dear. That's after we're gone. \nThey move away to start setting the table. \nABBY Yes, we talked with Reverend Harper about it. \nMORTIMER No, no. Teddy's got to go to Happy Dale now. At once ! Now, he's down in the cellar. Get him up here right away. \nMARTHA But, there's no such hurry as yet, you know. \nABBY No... When Teddy's working on the canal, you can't get his mind on anything else. \nMortimer stands up and comes to the table where his aunts are working. \nMORTIMER Well, look, darlings. Look, I'm frightfully sorry, but I've got an awful shock for you. \nHe takes Abby's hands in his. \nMORTIMER Teddy's killed a man, darlings ! \nMartha laughs. \nMARTHA Nonsense ! \nMORTIMER (he yells) But there's a body in the window-seat ! \nABBY Yes, dear. We know. \nMortimer looks even more shocked than before. His two aunts keep on setting the table as if nothing had happened. \nMORTIMER You know ? \nMARTHA Of course. \nABBY Yes, but it has nothing to do with Teddy. \nMortimer wants to speak, but Abby stops him. \nABBY Now, Mortimer. You just forget about it. Forget you ever saw the gentleman. MORTIMER Forget ? \nABBY We never dreamed you'd peek. \nMORTIMER What the... Who is he ? \nABBY He's a Mister Hoskins. Adam Hoskins. That's really all I know about him, except that he's a Methodist. \nMARTHA Oh ! He's a Methodist ? Isn't that nice. \nMORTIMER That's all you know ? But what's he doing here ? What happened to him ? \nMortimer is more and more shocked and his aunts, very calmly, keep on putting plates and silverware on the table. MARTHA He died. \nMORTIMER Look, Aunt Martha, men just don't get into window-seats and die. \nABBY No, dear. He died first. \nMortimer takes his aunts' hands to stop them from setting the table. \nMORTIMER Oh, well, now wait ! Stop all this. \nHe takes Abby's hands in his. \nMORTIMER Now look, darlings, how did he die ? \nABBY Oh, Mortimer, don't be so inquisitive. The gentleman died because he drank some wine with poison in it. \nMORTIMER But, how did the poison get in the wine ? \nMARTHA Well we put it in wine because it's less noticeable. When it's in tea, it has a distinct odor. \nMORTIMER You mean you... (yelling) You put it in the wine ? ABBY Yes. And I put Mister Hoskins in the window-seat, because Reverend Harper was coming. \nMortimer seems ready to faint. \nMORTIMER Ohh ! Look at me, darling. \nHe takes again Abby's hands in his. \nMORTIMER You mean, you mean you knew what you'd done and you didn't want the Reverend Harper to see the body ? \nABBY Well, not at tea. That wouldn't have been very nice. \nAbby goes back table-setting and Mortimer holds himself on the edge of the table. \nMORTIMER Ohh ! It's first-degree. \nABBY Now, Mortimer, you know all about it and just forget about it. I do think that Martha and I have the right to our own little secrets. \nMartha walks to the kitchen door, but she stops and turns around. \nMARTHA Oh, Abby, while I was out I dropped in on Missis Schultz. She's much better. But she wants us to take Junior to the movies again. \nABBY Well, we must do that, tomorrow or next day. \nMARTHA Yes, but this time we'll go where we want to go. Junior's not going to drag me into another one of those scary pictures. \nThe two sisters enter the kitchen. \nABBY No, they ought not to be allowed to make those pictures just to frighten people. \nMortimer remains alone in the room. He has the face of someone who thinks he is having a nightmare and hopes to wake up soon. \nHe goes to the telephone desk, picks up the phone and dials \u00ab0\u00bb. \nMORTIMER Operator ?... Can you hear my voice ?... You can ?... Are you sure ?... \nHe puts the phone down. MORTIMER Then I must be here. \nHe realizes there is no one on the phone, and puts it back down. MORTIMER Now, let's see. Where were we ? Twelve. (he yells) Twelve ! \nHe jumps from his chair and rushes toward the kitchen. But, when he sees his two aunts setting the table, he stops and goes to them. \nMARTHA Yes, dear. Abby thinks we should count the first one. \nMORTIMER Never mind about that. Just sit down. \nMartha sits down. \nMORTIMER Now, tell me, who was the first one ? \nABBY Mister Midgely. He was a Baptist. \nMARTHA He was such a lonely, old gentleman, Mister Midgely was. \nABBY All his kith and kin were dead. \nMARTHA We felt so sorry for him. \nABBY And then, when his heart attack came, and he sat there dead in that chair, looking so peaceful. Remember, Martha ? We made up our minds, then and there, that if we could help other lonely, old men to find that same peace, we would. MORTIMER Why, you poor... You mean, he dropped dead right in this chair ? \nMortimer realizes it's the chair he's sitting on, and stands up very quickly. \nABBY And then, you see, Teddy came up from digging in Panama, and he thought Mister Midgely was a yellow-fever victim. And that meant he had to be buried immediately. \nMORTIMER So ? \nMARTHA So, we all took him down to Panama, and put him in the lock and gave him a decent Christian burial. There, now you see ? (she stands up) That's why we told you not to bother about it, because we know exactly what's to be done. Mortimer is sitting on the table, and seems not to know what he must do next. But he suddenly stands up. \nMORTIMER Wait a minute ! \nHe rushes to his aunts. \nMORTIMER Come here, darlings. What about the others ? All twelve of them didn't walk in here and drop dead. \nABBY Oh, no, dear. Of course not ! \nMORTIMER Well, so, so... \nAbby whispers something in Martha's ear. Martha looks at Mortimer, smiles, and whispers back in her sister's ear. \nMARTHA Mortimer. \nMORTIMER Wh... what? \nMARTHA Do you remember those jars of poison that were on the shelves in Grandfather's laboratory all these years ? \nABBY You know your Aunt Martha's knack for mixing things. You've eaten enough of her piccalilli. \nMARTHA Well, dear, for a gallon of elderberry wine, I take one teaspoonful of arsenic, then add half a teaspoonful of strychnine. And then, just a pinch of cyanide. \nMORTIMER Mmmm ! Should have quite a kick. \nABBY Yes, as a matter of fact, one of our gentlemen found time to say : \u00abHow delicious !\u00bb \nMORTIMER He did ? Well, wasn't that nice of him ? \nMARTHA Abby, we mustn't be standing here gossiping all night. Well, we must get that cake frosted. \nShe moves toward the kitchen, followed by Abby. \nMORTIMER Oh no, darling, don't worry about the cake. I couldn't eat a thing. ABBY Oh, you newlyweds! A sip of wine will give you an appetite. \nMORTIMER That'd be nice, darling, a sip of... A sip of wine ! \nHe stands up. \nMORTIMER Wine ! \nHe wants to move away, but his foot get entangled in the back of a chair, and he almost falls down. \nBREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR DAY \nElaine appears at the window of her room. She is arranging the artificial flower on the lapel of her jacket. She moves away from the window. \nThe cab driver is still pacing on the sidewalk near his car. \nBREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nMortimer closes the drapes between the sitting-room and the next room. He then goes to the cellar door and opens the door ajar. A cat meows and comes out through the opening. We hear Teddy singing down in the cellar. \nMORTIMER I'm beginning to think the cat's in on this. \nHe listens to the singing coming from the cellar. \nMORTIMER He's wonderful. Happy as a lark. Singing away, digging locks. He closes the cellar door. \nMORTIMER Got him working on a yellow-fever victim. Oh, I can see the headlines now : \u00abMurder Incorporator Rides Again\u00bb right across the front page. Let me see... Teddy ! Of course. Everybody knows he's crazy. Let me see. Who can I call up ? Dewey, La Guardia, Winchell ? No, Winchell's no good. Old Judge Cullman ! \nHe starts moving across the room, putting his hand in the inside breast pocket of his jacket. \nMORTIMER I wonder if I got his number. \nHe gets a couple of tickets out of his pocket. He sits at the small telephone desk. \nMORTIMER What am I doing with tickets ? He throws the tickets on the desk. He picks up the phone, and starts dialing. \nMORTIMER Information... Hello ? Information ?... Get me the number of Judge Cullman on North Shore Road, Brooklyn. Yeah, would you call me back ? \nBREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nThe night has come. Elaine is walking very rapidly on the sidewalk. She passes near the taxi. The driver opens the door for her, but she keeps on walking. \nBREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nMortimer is standing by the window-seat. All the drapes are closed. He bends down. \nMORTIMER How it would be marvelous if he wasn't there. \nHe slowly opens the lid of the seat. When the lid is a few inches open, he peeks inside. \nELAINE (voice over) Hey, you ! \nWhen he hears Elaine's voice, Mortimer slams the lid down and sit on the seat. \nELAINE Thought you were tall, dark streak of light. \nShe is standing by the half-open door, and she makes the gestures Mortimer made when he had told her the same sentence, earlier in the churchyard. \nMORTIMER What are you doing here? \nGibbs shows his newspaper to Elaine \nGIBBS I read an ad here about a room to rent. ELAINE Oh ! Shut up ! \nShe walks away, leaving Gibbs at the door. She walks quickly by the taxi. The driver opens the door for her, but she walks on with quick steps. \nBREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nMortimer is still on the phone. \nMORTIMER Well, I thought that if you sign the papers, I can get Teddy to commit himself, and get him in Happy Dale... Yes, it's a wonderful place, Judge... You will ?... Fine ! I'll be over right as soon as I've made another call. \nThe front door bell rings. \nBREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nGibbs is standing by the door, ringing the bell. \nBREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nAbby comes in the room from the kitchen. Mortimer is still on the phone. \nABBY Doorbell's ringing, dear. \nShe crosses the room to the front door. She opens the door, revealing Gibbs. \nABBY Oh, how do you do ? Come in. The kitchen door has remained open, and we see Martha still working on her cooking. \nGIBBS (voice over) I understand you've got a room to rent. \nHearing that, Martha drops her cooking and comes into the room. \nABBY Yes... Do step in. \nAbby opens the door wide for him to get in. \nGIBBS Well, are you the lady of the house ? \nABBY Yes, I'm Miss Brewster. \nMORTIMER (voice over) Yeah, operator ? Give me long distance, please. \nMartha has joined her sister. \nABBY And this is my sister. Another Miss Brewster. \nGibbs takes off his hat. \nGIBBS My name's Gibbs. \nQuick shot on Mortimer, still on the phone. He gives a quick look toward his aunts, but doesn't seem interested. \nABBY Well, do sit down. I'm sorry, but we're just setting the table for dinner. \nShe moves an armchair on the other side of the table. \nABBY Now, this would be a nice comfortable chair. \nBack to Mortimer. \nMORTIMER Oh. Hello, long distance ? I want the Happy Dale Sanitarium, Happy Dale, New York. \nBack to Gibbs and the sisters. \nABBY Is Brooklyn your home ? \nGIBBS I haven't got a home. I live in a hotel. Don't like it. MARTHA A... are your family Brooklyn people ? \nMORTIMER (voice over) Hello ? Hap... \nGIBBS Haven't got any family. \nMORTIMER (voice over) Well, operator... \nABBY All alone in the world ? \nGIBBS Yeah. \nMORTIMER (voice over) No, no... \nAbby looks at her sister with a knowing smile. \nABBY Well, Martha.... \nMORTIMER (voice over) No, Happy Dale... Yes. \nABBY Well, you've come to just the right house. You sit down. \nShe helps him sit down in the armchair, while Martha is bringing a carafe of wine and a glass. \nMORTIMER (voice over) Dale. \u00abD\u00bb like in \u00abdig\u00bb, you know, when you dig a lock. That's right. \u00abA\u00bb like in \u00abarsenic\u00bb. Got that ? \nShort close-up on the carafe of wine, now on the table. \nGIBBS Is there always this much noise ? \nMARTHA Oh ! He doesn't live with us. \nMortimer is standing, with the telephone set in one hand, and the receiver on his ear in the other hand. He whispers. \nMORTIMER I can see the headlines now. Oh, please. (back to normal voice) Hello ? Back to the table. \nGIBBS I'd really like to see the room. Well, I don't think I'll like it. \nHe stands up and takes his hat, which he had put on the table. \nABBY The room's upstairs. \nAbby is seated at the table, with Martha standing behind her. She takes the carafe. \nABBY Won't you try a glass of our wine before we start up ? \nGIBBS Never touch it. \nMARTHA Well, we make this ourselves. It's elderberry wine. GIBBS Elderberry ? \nHe puts his hat back on the table and sits down. \nGIBBS I haven't tasted elderberry wine since I was a boy. \nMORTIMER (voice over) Oh... \nMORTIMER Don't do anything. I mean, don't do anything ! Don't let anyone in the house and leave Mr. Whosit right where he is. Oh ! Get off that thing. I can't talk to you... I can't concentrate. \nHe makes them stand up from the window-seat. \nMORTIMER Now, look, darlings, I wouldn't want anything in the world to happen to either of you. \nABBY But, what on earth could happen to us? \nMORTIMER Well, darling... Anyway, you'll do that little thing for me, won't you ? All right. Abby nods. \nMORTIMER Where's my hat ? There it is. \nHe leaves them to pick up his hat. \nMARTHA But, Mortimer. \nMORTIMER (voice over) What, darling, what ? \nMARTHA We were planning to hold services before dinner. \nMORTIMER Look, couldn't that wait until I get back ? \nABBY Oh, and you could join us in the hymns ! \nMORTIMER Yes, darling, I could join you in the hymns. I'll sing with you, I'll dance with you, I'll do anything. But... remember, don't let anybody in the house until I get back. You promise ? \nAbby and Martha nod. \nMORTIMER Good. \nHe puts the hat on his head. The hat is ostensibly to large for him. He opens the front door \nABBY (voice over) Mortimer ! \nHe was almost out, but he turns around. \nMORTIMER What ? \nAbby points to the hat, but can't talk. \nABBY Uh-uh-uh-uh !... \nMORTIMER Stop that \u00abuh-uh-uh\u00bb. What is it ? \nABBY Mr. Hoskins' hat ! \nMortimer raises his eyes, and tears the had off his head \nMORTIMER Ohhhh !... \nHe throws the hat away, leaves and closes the door. \nBREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nThe cab driver is pacing back and forth on the sidewalk near his taxi. \nMortimer comes running out of the house. The driver goes toward him. \nCAB DRIVER Do you still want me to wait here ? \nMORTIMER Yes ! Call me a cab ! \nCAB DRIVER Yeah. Okay, okay ! \nThey run together and stop in front of the parked taxi. The driver waves his arm. \nCAB DRIVER Hey, cab !... Here you are. \nAnother taxi stops near the first one. The driver wants to open the back door for Mortimer. \nMORTIMER Don't open it. I'll sit with you ! \nCAB DRIVER Yeah, that's right. I can go faster that way. Sure. \nMortimer climbs in the front of the taxi, next to the driver. The taxi drives away, and the first driver remains on the street, touching his cap. \nCAB DRIVER Wait a minute ! What am I doing ? Hey ! \nHe pats his own taxi, points his finger to it and waves for the other taxi to come back. \nCAB DRIVER Come here ! \nBREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nAbby picks up Mr. Hoskins' hat. She brushes it with her hand and gives it to Martha. \nABBY Fancy getting nice Mr. Hoskins' hat all mussed up. \nMARTHA Shame ! Such a nice hat. She crosses the room and, takes a brush on a cupboard near the window-seat, and starts brushing the hat. \nMARTHA You know, Abby, Mortimer didn't seem to be quite himself today. \nAbby brings two candlesticks on the table \nABBY No. Oh, well. \nMartha opens the cupboard, which is full of man's hats. She puts Hoskins' hat with the others, and then closes the cupboard \nMARTHA Well, what were you saying about Mortimer ? \nAbby has lit the candles. \nABBY Oh, I think I understand why he seemed so upset. \nMARTHA Why ? \nABBY He's just been married. I believe that always makes a man a little nervous. \nMARTHA Oh, yes. The poor dears. \nShe crosses the room to the door to switch off the lights \nMARTHA I'm so happy for Elaine. Oh, Abby ! If Mortimer's coming back for the services for Mr. Hoskins, we're going to need another hymnal. There's one up in my room. \nKnocks at the front door. Through the frosted window-panels of the door, we see the shadows of two men. \nABBY Oh, I'll go, dear. \nMARTHA Abby, we promised Mortimer we wouldn't let anyone come in. \nMore knocks at the door. Martha peeks through the drapes of a convenient window, a few steps above floor-level on the staircase. \nJONATHAN We come to him for help and he tries to shake us down. Besides, he said I looked like Boris Karloff. That's your work, doctor. You did that to me. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN No, please, Johnny, take it easy. We'll find some place and I'll fix you up right away. \nJONATHAN Tonight. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN Yes, tonight, but I have to eat first. \nThe two sisters are peeking in the room through a small rectangular hole in the door of the kitchen. JONATHAN This time, I want the face of an absolute nonentity. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN Yes, Johnny. I know exactly what I'm going to do. \nHe comes close to Jonathan and shows him on his face what he is going to do to it. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN You see, I'm going to take this piece here and lift it up... \nJONATHAN Be careful about the stitches this time. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN You leave that up to me. I'll give you nice little ears and... \nJONATHAN You were careless last time. DOCTOR EINSTEIN And new stitches. And on the eyes I'll do a Schmidt. That's my specialty. You see, I take it together like this... \nJONATHAN Leave the eyes alone. Leave the nose alone. \nThe scene dissolves to : \nJUDGE CULLMAN'S OFFICE - INTERIOR DAY. \nThe judge is sitting, studying some papers. Mortimer is standing at his side. \nJUDGE CULLMAN Poor Teddy. I imagine it's for the best. \nHe drops the papers on the desk and starts declaiming. \nJUDGE CULLMAN Well... \u00abOurs not to reason why, ours but to do...\u00bb \nMortimer is very irritated by the Judge's erratic attitude. He puts a pen in his hand. \nMORTIMER Sign right here, please, Judge. Excuse me. Right there. \nJUDGE CULLMAN Sometimes I think, with the world in its present chaotic state... \nMortimer takes the pen from the Judge's hand and starts signing the papers. \nMORTIMER Yes, I know, we'd all be better off at Happy Dale. I sign here as next of kin, don't I ? \nJUDGE CULLMAN Only last week I created a mild sensation at the Bar Association, when I said... \nMortimer dries the document, and shakes the Judge's hand. \nMORTIMER Yes. Goodbye. Good luck, Judge. Thank you. \nHe walks to the door of the office. \nJUDGE CULLMAN Tell Martha and Abby I'll be over this week. I've been feeling rather lonely. \nMortimer comes back on his steps. \nMORTIMER No ! No ! Oh no ! Never tell them you've been lonely. Never ! JUDGE CULLMAN Why, I... I... I... \nMortimer comes back to the Judge's desk. \nMORTIMER Judge ! Tell me, are you a drinking man ? \nJUDGE CULLMAN Why, no. I never indulge. \nMORTIMER Good ! Then you'll live longer. \nHe goes back to the door. \nJUDGE CULLMAN Of course a little wine now... \nMORTIMER No ! No ! For heaven's sake, no wine ! No wine ! \nHe goes out, slamming the door behind him. The Judge looks pensively at the door Mortimer just closed. \nJUDGE CULLMAN I may be committing the wrong Brewster. \nThe scene dissolves to : \nBREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nThe Brewster sister are sitting at the table with Doctor Einstein and Jonathan. The dinner is finished, and both men are smoking. \nABBY Well, I'm sure you both want to get to wherever you're going. \nThe two sisters stands up from the table. \nJONATHAN My dear, sweet aunties, I'm so full of your delicious dinner I'm unable to move a muscle. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN Yes, it's nice here. \nTeddy comes out of his room on the balcony. He is still wearing his colonial costume. He has a book in his hand and a spare pith helmet under his arm. He rushes down the stairs. \nTEDDY I found it ! I found it ! \nHe stops suddenly in the staircase. \nTEDDY Gentlemen, be seated. Jonathan and Einstein pretend they are standing up, but they immediately sit back in their chairs. \nTeddy comes down the last steps and goes toward the table. \nTEDDY Here it is, gentlemen. The story of my life, my biography. \nHe puts the book on the table, in front of Einstein. It's open on a page with a picture. \nTEDDY Here's the picture I was telling you about, General. Here we are, both of us. President Roosevelt and General Goethals at Culebra Cut. That's me, General, and that's you. \nEinstein looks at the picture. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN My, how I've changed ! \nTEDDY Well, you see, that picture hasn't been taken yet. We haven't even started work on Culebra Cut. We're still digging locks. And now, General, we will both go to Panama and inspect the new lock. \nHe gives the spare helmet to Einstein. \nABBY No, Teddy. Not to Panama. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN Oh, maybe some other time, Mister President. Panama is a long ways off. TEDDY Nonsense ! It's just down in the cellar. \nJonathan, who hadn't seemed to be much interested by Teddy's conversation, suddenly looks up. \nABBY No, Teddy, we must keep it a secret. \nMARTHA Yeah ! \nTEDDY A state secret ? \nABBY Yes, a state secret. \nMARTHA Promised ? \nTEDDY You have the word of the President of the United States. Cross my heart and hope to die. \nHe crosses his chest and spits on the floor. Then, he takes his aunts in his arms. \nTEDDY Now, let's see. How are we going to keep it a secret ? \nABBY Well, Teddy, I think you'd better get back down into the cellar. And then, when I turn out the lights, when everything's dark here, you come up and take the poor man down to the canal. Now get along, Teddy. \nTeddy crosses the room to the cellar door. \nABBY And we'll come down later and hold services. \nTeddy opens the door, and turns around. \nTEDDY Where is the poor devil ? \nABBY (voice over) In the window-seat. \nTEDDY It seems to be spreading. We've never had yellow fever there before. \nMARTHA Abby. I've never even seen Mister Hoskins ! \nABBY Oh, my goodness! That's right, you were out. Well, you just come right along and see him now. You know, he's really very nice looking, considering that he's a Methodist. \nBoth sisters go to the window-seat and are ready to lift the lid, when the drapes above the seat suddenly open wide, revealing a very menacing Jonathan. The two sisters back off, frightened. \nJonathan slowly climbs in through the window, and stands up on the window-seat. \nJONATHAN We're bringing the luggage through here. \nHe gets down from the window-seat. Then Einstein appears behind the window, carrying a suitcase. Jonathan helps him to bring the suitcase in the room. \nABBY Jonathan, your room is waiting for you. You can go right up. \nEinstein, still outside the window, gives Jonathan another suitcase. \nJONATHAN I'm afraid we don't keep Brooklyn hours. You two run along to bed. \nABBY Oh, but you must be very tired. Both of you. And we don't go to bed this early. \nJONATHAN It's time I came home to take care of you. Behind Jonathan, Einstein has come into the room and is closing the window, and then the drapes. \nJONATHAN (to Einstein) Take the bags upstairs. \nEinstein takes the two suitcases and starts moving away. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN For the instruments, I'll come back later. \nABBY Good night. \nEinstein slightly bows to Abby. \nJONATHAN Now, we'll all go to bed. \nABBY I'll wait until you're up and then turn out the lights. \nEinstein has already almost reached the balcony. Martha starts climbing, with Jonathan behind her. \nJONATHAN Run along, Aunt Martha. Just off the laboratory, Doctor. \nEverybody reaches the balcony. Einstein disappears at the end of the balcony, and Martha enters her room. Jonathan turns around and looks down at Abby. \nJONATHAN All right, Aunt Abby. \nABBY I'll be right up. \nJONATHAN Now, Aunt Abby ! Turn out the lights. \nAbby goes to the switch near the front door, and switches the lights off. The room is completely dark. \nAbby climbs the stairs, reaches the balcony, and walks slowly pass Jonathan, who is still standing at the same place. Then, she quickly enters the room she shares with her sister, who is holding the door open for her. \nJonathan moves along the balcony and starts climbing the stairs to the upper floor. He stops after a few steps, and sees the door of his aunts' room opening slowly. Abby comes out. \nJONATHAN Aunt Abby. \nAbby quickly goes back into the room and closes the door. Jonathan resumes his climbing. The camera moves down into total black darkness, and then into the room, where we see some light underneath the cellar door. We hear steps, and the door opens to reveal Teddy, still in his colonial costume, but without the helmet. He stops a few seconds, then starts crossing the room, only lit by light coming from underneath the kitchen door. We hear the lid of the window-seat creaking, and we guess Teddy has just opened it. Shuffling noises. Then we see the shadow of Teddy carrying something apparently heavy. We hear the cat screaming, and we guess Teddy must have stepped on its tail. When Teddy comes into the light from the open door of the cellar, we discover he is carrying a human body, which could only be Mr. Hoskins' one taken from the window-seat. Teddy turns around and starts going backward down the steps to the cellar. He stops a few seconds to close the door. Then we hear noises of something falling, and we guess that Teddy must have missed a step and fallen all the way down to the cellar. \nBlack screen during one second. \nEinstein is going down the staircase, lit only by a match he is holding in his hand. DOCTOR EINSTEIN He's all right, Johnny. \nWhen he gets on floor level, he meets Jonathan. \nJONATHAN I'll open the window. You go round and hand him through. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN But he's too heavy for me. \nHe burns his finger and blows the match. The scene becomes completely dark. We see only shadows. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN You go outside, Johnny, and push, and I'll stay here and pull. And then together we take him down to Panama. Huh ? \nJONATHAN All right. We must be quick. I'll take a look around outside the house. When I tap on the glass, you open the window. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN Yeah. \nJonathan moves to the front door, opens it, stops to look around, and then closes the door. \nEinstein walks slowly in the room. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN It's dark in here. \nHe bumps into something. We hear the lid of the window-seat creaking several times. Einstein light another match, and we discover he has fallen into the open window-seat, where he is now lying \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN Where am I ? Oh, here I am. \nHe slowly gets out of the seat. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN Who left this open ? \nJonathan taps on the window. Einstein blows the match and opens the window. \nWITHERSPOON'S OFFICE - INTERIOR NIGHT \nWITHERSPOON By the way, you've had the papers signed by your brother and the doctor, of course ? \nBREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nMortimer seems surprised by the question. \nMORTIMER Oh, the doctor ? Oh, holy mackerel ! I forgot the doctor ! Mortimer takes a piece of paper from the inside pockets of his jacket and puts it on the desk. Elaine is still whining at his side. ELAINE Mortimer ! \nMORTIMER (yelling to Elaine) Please, be quiet ! Can't you see I've got to get a doctor ? (to Witherspoon on the phone) Hello ? What kind of a doctor ? A family doctor ? \nELAINE You can take your honeymoon, your wedding ring, your taxi, your window-seat, and put them in a barrel, and push them all over Niagara Falls ! \nShe walks away \nMORTIMER (to the departing Elaine) Thank you, darling. Thank you. (to Witherspoon on the phone) Oh, look, why don't you come down here anyway ? While you're getting here, I'll get Teddy's and the doctor's signatures both. \nThe front door slams violently. Mortimer turns around. \nMORTIMER Yeah. Elaine ! Elaine ! (to Witherspoon) Yeah, I'll get both signatures. Yeah, well, come right away. \nHe puts the phone down. \nMORTIMER Elaine ? What's the matter with her ? \nHe stands up and runs across the room to the window-seat. \nMORTIMER Oh, dear ! \nHe kneels on the window-seat and looks through the open window. \nMORTIMER Elaine ! Elaine ! \nBREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nLarge shot of Reverend Harper's residence. Elaine enters the front door, and slams the door behind her. \nBREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nMortimer is still looking through the open window. \nMORTIMER Elaine ! \nHe enters back into the room, and sits on the window-seat. \nMORTIMER (whispering to himself) Oh, let me sit down. Let me think about this thing. Doctor, Teddy, signature... \nHe looks at the seat. \nMORTIMER Hoskins ! \nHe remains seated a few seconds in deep thought, then he gives a quick look outside the window, stands up and starts lifting the lid. The lid creaks. Mortimer seems very surprised by what he sees inside the seat. He opens the lid completely and let it rest on the bottom of the window. \nMORTIMER Ye gods ! There's another one ! He closes the lid and walks across the room toward the kitchen door. \nMORTIMER Aunt Abby ! Aunt Martha ! Come in here ! \nABBY (voice over from the kitchen) We're busy. \nMORTIMER No, you come in here now ! \nAbby, still in funeral clothes, enters the room through the kitchen door. \nABBY Yes, dear, what is it ? Where's Elaine ? \nMORTIMER Wait a minute. Didn't you promise me not to let anyone in the house while I was gone ? \nABBY Jonathan just walked in. \nMORTIMER I don't mean Jonathan ! \nABBY And Doctor... \nMORTIMER And I don't mean Doctor Einstein ! Who is that in the window-seat ? \nABBY We told you. Mister Hoskins. \nMORTIMER He is not Mister Hoskins ! \nHe opens the window-seat wide and let the lid rest on the bottom of the window. \nMORTIMER There ! \nAbby walks to the window-seat and looks inside, surprised. \nABBY Who can that be ? \nMORTIMER You're trying to tell me you've never seen that man before ? \nABBY I certainly am. Well, this is a fine how-do-you-do ! It's getting so anyone thinks he can walk in this house ! \nMORTIMER Now, you look here, Aunt Abby. Don't you try to get out of this ! That's another one of your gentlemen, and you know it ! \nABBY Mortimer, how can you say such a thing ? That man's an impostor. And if he came here to be buried in our cellar, he's mistaken. \nMORTIMER You admitted to me you put Mister Hoskins in the window- seat. \nABBY Yes, I did. \nMORTIMER Well, this man couldn't have got the idea from Mister Hoskins ! \nABBY Oh, no. \nMORTIMER By the way, where is Mister Hoskins ? \nMortimer starts looking around the room. \nABBY He must have gone to Panama. \nMORTIMER What ? You buried him ? \nABBY No, no, not yet. He's just down there waiting for the services, poor dear. We haven't had a minute, what with Jonathan in the house. \nMortimer suddenly realizes the corpse could be a \u00abfriend\u00bb of Jonathan. He quickly closes the lid. \nABBY Oh, dear. We've always wanted to hold a double funeral. But I will not read services over a total stranger ! \nShe walks back to the kitchen. Mortimer catches her. \nMORTIMER A total stranger. Aunt Abby, how can I believe you ? There are twelve men down there, some you admit you poisoned them ! \nHe crosses the room toward Jonathan \nMORTIMER Now, listen, Jonathan, this is your last chance. I'll keep O'Hara busy in the kitchen and give you a chance to get out. All three of you : you, Doctor Einstein and Spenalzo. JONATHAN Mortimer... \nMORTIMER Now if you don't leave here in five minutes, I'll bring in Officer O'Hara, and introduce him to Mr. Spenalzo. \nHe opens the lid of the window-seat. But O'Hara comes into the room and Mortimer quickly closes the lid. \nO'HARA Mister Brewster, my play takes place in... \nMortimer moves him back to the kitchen. \nMORTIMER I'll be right with you, O'Hara. Right with you. Right with you. Just give me one moment. \nMortimer closes the door behind O'Hara and turns toward Jonathan. \nMORTIMER Now get going ! All three of you. \nHe enters the kitchen, and closes the door behind him. Einstein arrives silently behind Jonathan and taps on this shoulder. Jonathan turns quickly around. He then goes to the kitchen door and comes back to Einstein. \nJONATHAN Doctor, this affair between my brother and myself has got to be settled. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN But, Johnny, we've got trouble enough as it is. Come, let's go. \nJONATHAN We're not going. We're going to sleep right here in this house. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN What ? With a cop in the kitchen and Spenalzo in the window-seat ? \nJONATHAN That's all he's got on us. We'll take Spenalzo and dump him in the bay. After that, we're coming back here. Then if he tries to interfere... \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN No, no, Johnny. No, please. \nJONATHAN Doctor, we've got a wonderful setup here. We can make a fortune. Two old ladies as a front. Only Mortimer stands in our way. I never did like Mortimer. \nHe goes toward the kitchen door. Einstein catches up with him. DOCTOR EINSTEIN No, Johnny, please, take it easy. Please ! \nJONATHAN Doctor, you know when I make up my mind... \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN Yeah, I know, when you make up your mind, you lose your head. Look, Johnny, Brooklyn ain't a good setup for you. \nJonathan takes Einstein's hand, twists it and brings Einstein down on the floor. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN Okay, Johnny. Okay ! \nJonathan releases Einstein's hand, who stands up to massage his hand. \nJONATHAN Take the instruments and hide them in the cellar. Move fast. Einstein takes the suitcase and walks to the cellar. Jonathan opens the lid of the window-seat. \nBREWSTER RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - INTERIOR NIGHT \nIn the kitchen, the Brewster sisters are moving around the room, preparing food on the table. Both men are standing up near the table. O'Hara, without his cap on his head, has a sandwich in his hand. \nO'HARA Mister Brewster, you don't know what goes on in Brooklyn. \nMORTIMER Oh, I don't know. \nO'Hara picks up a cup on the table. \nO'HARA No. My mother was an actress. \nMORTIMER Oh ? Legitimate ? \nO'HARA Of course she was. She was my mother. \nMORTIMER Oh, excuse me. \nO'HARA Peaches La Tour was her name. \nBREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nThe door to the cellar is open. Einstein rushes up from the cellar. He looks a bit frightened. DOCTOR EINSTEIN Hey, Johnny, Johnny, come quick ! \nJonathan, who was looking down into the open window-seat, stands up. \nJONATHAN What's the matter ? \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN You know that hole in the cellar ? \nJONATHAN Yes. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN Well, we got an ace in the hole. \nJonathan closes the window-seat, and walks toward the cellar. \nBREWSTER RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - INTERIOR NIGHT O'Hara is explaining something to Mortimer. \nO'HARA It's no fly-by-night idea. I've been working on this thing for twelve years. \nMortimer, who had just heard the creaking of the lid of the window-seat, turns back toward the policeman. \nMORTIMER Well, you have ? \nO'HARA Yeah. \nMORTIMER Well, rehash it in your mind. I'll be back in a minute. \nO'HARA Oh, swell. \nMORTIMER I like the first act. \nO'HARA But I didn't tell you the first act, Mister Brew... I... \nBefore he can finish his sentence, Mortimer is already out of the room. \nBREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nMortimer enters the empty sitting-room. He goes to the window- seat, opens it and talks to the corpse. \nMORTIMER No, I thought I told you... He closes the lid, kneels on the seat and looks through the open window. \nMORTIMER Jonathan ! Jonathan ! Jonathan ! \nJonathan enters from the cellar, followed by Einstein. \nJONATHAN Yes, Mortimer. \nMortimer turns around and looks, surprised, at his brother. Then he comes into the room \nMORTIMER What are you two doing still here ? I thought I told you to beat it. \nJONATHAN We're not going. MORTIMER You're not going ? \nThey stop when they see Jonathan and Einstein. \nABBY Oh ! We thought we heard you leave. \nJONATHAN Perish the thought, dear aunties. That was just Mortimer. And speaking of services, Aunt Martha, will you make us some coffee while we take Mister Spenalzo down to the cellar ? \nMARTHA Oh, no. No, Jonathan. You've got to take him with you ! \nJonathan opens the lid of the window-seat. \nJONATHAN There's a friend of Mortimer's downstairs waiting for him. \nABBY A friend of Mortimer's ? \nJONATHAN Take his feet, Doctor. Mister Spenalzo and he will get along fine together. They're both dead. \nThe two men bend down to take the corpse out of the window-seat. \nMARTHA Oh ! He must mean Mister Hoskins. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN Mister Hoskins ? \nThe two men stand up and look at the sisters. Jonathan comes closer to them. \nJONATHAN You know about what's down there ? ABBY Of course we do. And he's no friend of Mortimer's. He's one of our gentlemen. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN Your gentlemen ? \nMARTHA Yes. And we won't have any strangers buried in our cellar. \nJONATHAN But Mister Hoskins ? \nMARTHA Mister Hoskins is no stranger. \nABBY Besides, there's no room for Mister Spenalzo. The cellar's crowded already. \nJONATHAN Crowded ? With what ? \nABBY There are twelve graves down there now. \nThe two men look at each other. Jonathan seems the most surprised. \nJONATHAN Twelve graves. \nABBY That leaves very little room and we're going to need it. \nJONATHAN You mean that you and Aunt Martha have murdered twelve... ABBY Murdered ? Certainly not. It's one of our charities. \nMARTHA Why, what we've been doing is a mercy. \nABBY So you just take your Mister Spenalzo out of here. \nThey turn to Einstein, who has seated himself and is laughing his head off. \nJONATHAN You've done all that right here in this house and buried them in the cellar ? \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN That's wonderful, Johnny ! \nHe stands up. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN We've been chased all over the world, and they stay right here in Brooklyn, and they do just as good as you do. \nJONATHAN What ? \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN Yeah. You got twelve, they got twelve. \nJonathan grabs Einstein by his shirt. \nJONATHAN I've got thirteen. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN No, Johnny, twelve. Don't brag. \nJONATHAN Thirteen. \nThey both starts counting on their fingers. \nJONATHAN There's Mister Spenalzo. Then the first one in London. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN Yeah. \nJONATHAN Two in Johannesburg, one in Sydney, one in Melbourne, two in San Francisco, one in Phoenix, Arizona. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN Phoenix ? \nJONATHAN The filling station. DOCTOR EINSTEIN Filling st... Oh, yes. \nHe mimes the gesture of one having his throat cut. \nJONATHAN Three in Chicago and one in South Bend. That makes thirteen. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN You cannot count the one in South Bend. He died of pneumonia. \nJONATHAN He wouldn't have died of pneumonia if I hadn't shot him. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN No, no, Johnny, you cannot count him. You got twelve, they got twelve. The old ladies is just as good as you are. \nBoth sisters seem very happy by Einstein's statement. They smile. DOCTOR EINSTEIN They are, are they ? That's easily taken care of. All I need is one more. That's all. Just one more. And I've a pretty good idea who it is. \nHe looks menacingly at his two aunts, who do not smile anymore. \nBREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nMortimer is walking along the gate of the churchyard, dragging Dr. Gilchrist with him. Gilchrist is trying to tie his necktie while walking. Apparently, Mortimer didn't let him dress completely when he took him out of his home. \nMORTIMER I'm a very lucky man to have caught you at home, Doctor Gilchrist. \nDOCTOR GILCHRIST This is most irregular, most irregular. \nMORTIMER I'm sorry to have dragged you out of bed, but, you see, you're the only one who can help me. \nDOCTOR GILCHRIST I know Teddy blows bugles, but I can't commit a man to an institution just on that. \nMORTIMER Oh, well, if only you had a little talk with him, I assure you you'd be convinced by him. Here's the house I... \nThey stop walking when they hear hymns sung by the Brewster sisters. \nMORTIMER There goes Hoskins. DOCTOR GILCHRIST Who ? \nMortimer looks embarrassed : he doesn't want to explain to the doctor who Hoskins is. \nMORTIMER What ? What ? Did I say... Oh, I... \nElaine bends out of her window to hug Mortimer. \nELAINE Darling, that's ancient history. \nMedium shot on the doctor and Teddy walking arm in arm among the tombstones. \nTEDDY Yes, Doctor, I'll run for a third term, but I won't be elected. And that'll mean the last of the Roosevelts in the White House. \nDOCTOR GILCHRIST That's what you think. \nTEDDY Of course, if the country insists... \nBack to Elaine's room window. The young couple is still talking on either side of the window. \nELAINE Oh, darling, all this doesn't prove a thing. Look at your aunts. They're Brewsters, aren't they ? They're the sweetest, sanest people I've ever known. \nMORTIMER Yeah. \nHe turns around to listen to his aunts singing their hymns. \nMORTIMER Well, even they have their peculiarities. \nELAINE What of it ? So your family's crazy. So you're crazy. That's the way I want you, the way I love you. I'm crazy too, but kiss me. \nMORTIMER No, no. I... Ohhh ! \nMortimer hesitates a little and then gives a passionate kiss to Elaine. \nBack to Teddy and the doctor. Teddy is vigorously shaking the doctor's hand. \nDOCTOR GILCHRIST Goodbye, Ambassador. I've enjoyed this little talk very much. Anytime you're in Washington, drop in to see me at the White House. \nHe walks away, leaving the doctor very shaken by the experience. The doctor runs to Mortimer, still outside Elaine's window and kissing her passionately. The doctor clears loudly his throat to attract Mortimer's attention. \nDOCTOR GILCHRIST Those papers. Those papers. \nMORTIMER Go away. \nMortimer suddenly realizes what the doctor is talking about. \nMORTIMER Oh, papers ! Papers ! Yes. \nHe pulls the papers from his jacket pocket, and gives them to the doctor. \nDOCTOR GILCHRIST I'll enjoy committing him to any place. \nMORTIMER You will ? \nDOCTOR GILCHRIST I've just been appointed Ambassador to Bolivia ! \nMORTIMER Ah, you see ? Didn't I tell you ? \nElaine suddenly slams her window down... on Mortimer's fingers ! Mortimer yells because of the pain. The doctor looks up from the papers. Elaine also shut the inside shade down, shutting the room completely from the outside world. \nMORTIMER No. Don't worry about that. Just go on signing the papers. Oh dear. Thank you. \nMortimer blows on his hurt fingers, then grabs the papers from the doctor and runs away. \nMORTIMER Okay, thank you. \nBREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nClose-up on the empty window-seat, where just remains Mr. Spenalzo's hat. \nFrom the open cellar door, Martha is coming out, followed by Abby. They are still dressed in their funeral clothes. \nABBY All right ! All right ! We'll find out whose house this is ! I'm warning you, you better stop it. There's no use doing what you're doing, because it'll just have to be undone. \nJONATHAN (voice over from the cellar) Aunt Abby, go to bed ! \nABBY It's a terrible thing to do to bury a good Methodist with a foreigner. \nMortimer comes rushing into the room with the papers in his hand. \nMORTIMER Hello. \nHe blows on the papers to dry the ink of the signature. \nABBY Mortimer, where have you been ? \nMortimer starts running upstairs. \nMORTIMER Uh-uh ? Oh, I was getting some papers signed. Is Teddy in his room ? \nMARTHA Oh, Mortimer, what is the matter with you ? Running around getting papers signed at a time like this. \nABBY Martha and I are going for the police. \nMORTIMER Police ! He quickly get back downstairs \nMORTIMER Oh-oh-oh ! Wait-wait-wait ! You can't go for the police. \nMARTHA Oh, no ? You know what Jonathan's doing ? \nABBY He's putting Mister Hoskins and Mister Spenalzo in together. \nMORTIMER Oh, darling, let him. \nBREWSTER RESIDENCE - CELLAR - INTERIOR NIGHT \nEinstein just finished working, and he is cleaning the bottom of his pants. We notice he is wearing Mr. Spenalzo's shoes. A shovel is resting on the wall near him. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN This is all fixed up nice now. Nice and smooth like a lake. The President will be very proud of his Panama Canal. \nHe stretches himself \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN Oh, Johnny, bed feels good already. You know, we didn't get any sleep for forty-eight hours. \nJonathan walks behind him, carrying a shovel. He puts the shovel down against the wall and start mounting the stairs \nJONATHAN You're forgetting, Doctor. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN What ? \nBREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nMortimer is trying to calm his aunts down \nABBY Now, look. If Jonathan and Mister Spenalzo aren't out this house before morning, we're going for the police. \nMORTIMER Yeah, but I'll get them out, I promise you that ! \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN You get out of here ! Look, look, when Johnny's in that mood, he's a madman. He's a maniac ! And then things happen. Horrible things. \nHe mimes the cutting of his own throat, and takes Mortimer's hand to throw him out. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN You get out of here ! \nMORTIMER Will you stop it ? Now look, stop telling me about Jonathan, I'll take care of Jonathan, and you take care of yourself. Now, get going, little fellow. \nHe opens the door to throw him out. He pats him on the behind to move him, and discover the shape of the bottle under his hand. \nMORTIMER What's that ? What's that ? Wait a minute. \nHe takes the bottle out of Einstein's pocket \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN Oh no ! My schnapps ! \nMORTIMER I could use that. I could use that. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN That's mine. \nHe tries to get his bottle back, but Mortimer holds on it. \nMORTIMER Please. Only for dramatic critics. Now look, you beat it before things start popping around here. \nHe moves away to the table, with the bottle in his hand. Einstein joins his hand in a praying gesture. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN But, look, Mr. Brewster, please. You've just been married. You have a nice little wife waiting for you. Please go now. Please. \nMortimer pours some of the schnapps in a glass. \nEinstein slams the front door with a very nervous punch, and walks toward Mortimer. He mumbles incomprehensible words, probably in German. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN Tell me, don't those plays you see all the time teach you anything ? \nMortimer is drinking. He lowers his glass. \nMORTIMER Oh, stop it, don't get me on the subject of plays ! I've got a lot on my mind now. I've got to wait here for Mister Witherspoon. \nHe looks at his watch. DOCTOR EINSTEIN At least people in plays act like they got sense. \nMORTIMER Oh, you think so ? Did you ever see anybody in a play ever act like they got intelligence ? \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN How can somebody be so stupid ? \nMORTIMER You ought to have my job a few nights. Listen to me, brother. When you get out of prison, you have yourself wheeled over to the Garrick Theater. Oh ! Oh ! There's a play there that's been running so bad that it'll still be running when you get out. Now, in this, there's a man... Now listen to this... \nBehind Mortimer, the cellar door opens silently and Jonathan enters slowly into the room, without Mortimer noticing him. \nMORTIMER Now, he knows he's in the house with murderers. So he ought to know he's in danger. He's even been warned to get out of the house. And does he go ? \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN Yes. \nMORTIMER No, he doesn't. He stays ! This fellow doesn't even have sense to be scared or to be on his guard. No, no. The murderer even invites him to sit down. What do you think he does ? \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN Well, I don't know. MORTIMER He sits down ! I remember what he did. He deliberately pulls up a chair like that and he sits down in it. \nMortimer goes to a wooden armchair and sits down in it. He puts his glass on the table. \nMORTIMER Isn't that great ? So there he is, all waiting to be trussed up and gagged. What do you think they used to truss him up with ? \nHe keeps on laughing while talking. \nClose-up of Jonathan's face, smiling. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN (voice over) Oh, what ? \nMORTIMER (voice over) The curtain cord. \nJonathan looks in the direction of the window... and the curtain cord. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN Curtain cord ? But didn't he see him get it ? \nBehind the seated Mortimer, Jonathan is silently walking to the window. \nMORTIMER Seen him get it. No. The silly chump sits down with his back toward the murderer. \nMortimer turns slightly on his chair, but without taking his eyes off Einstein, and, of course, without looking at his brother behind him, quietly cutting the curtain cords with a jack-knife. \nMORTIMER All he has to do is look around, but does he ? No ! \nMedium shot on Jonathan cutting the curtain cords. \nMORTIMER (voice over) No... Look, you see, brother Heidelberg, in a play or even in a movie, for that matter, ...a fellow never sees or hears anything. No. That's right. \nJonathan folds the jack-knife and puts it in his pocket. He prepares the cords he has just cut. Einstein takes a napkin on the table. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN But what does he do ? \nMORTIMER Oh, what does he do ? Well, the big chump sits there. This fellow's supposed to be bright. He sits there. \nJonathan is now just behind Mortimer's chair, with the cord ready in his hands. \nMORTIMER Now get a load of this. Look, look at the attitude. Large as life ! He sits there waiting to be tied up and gagged. The big dope ! \nHe bursts out laughing... But only for two seconds, because Jonathan ties up his arm to the armchair from behind, and Einstein shoves the napkin in his open mouth. Einstein then helps Jonathan to tie Mortimer's legs to the legs of the armchair. Then, with the help of a knife, he puts all the napkin in Mortimer's mouth. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN You were right about that fellow. He wasn't very bright. \nFade out, and then fade in on the same scene a few moments later. The lights have been dimmed. Mortimer is completely tied on the chair, and the gag is tied around his head. \nJONATHAN Yes, Mortimer. I've been away for twenty years. But never, my dear brother, were you out of my mind. \nJonathan is lighting candles on the table. \nJONATHAN In Melbourne one night, I dreamt of you. \nHe opens his instruments case. We see the surgery instruments shining in the candles light. \nClose-up on Mortimer's very frightened face. \nEinstein sits down near the table. He seems depressed at the sight of his surgery instruments. \nJonathan takes a small phial from the inside pocket of his jacket, opens it, smells it and closes it, and puts it back in his pocket. \nJONATHAN The more you struggle, Mortimer, the more you strangle yourself. Later on, you may consider that a blessing. \nHe takes a curved forceps from the case and plays with it. \nClose-up on Mortimer's frightened face. \nEinstein wipes his face with a napkin. \nO'HARA All I said was he looked like Boris Karloff. \nLIEUTENANT ROONEY Boris ?... Turn him over. \nSaunders turns Jonathan over and both the lieutenant and Brophy bends on the face of Jonathan. \nBROPHY Kind of think he's wanted somewhere. Rooney stands up and looks at Brophy with an ironical smile. \nLIEUTENANT ROONEY Oh ! You \u00abkind of think he's wanted somewhere\u00bb ? If you guys can't look at the circulars we put up in the station, you can at least read short detective stories. Certainly, he's wanted somewhere. In Indiana ! He escaped from the prison for criminally insane. He's a lifer. \nStill seated on his step, Mortimer smiles. \nMORTIMER That's my brother ! \nLIEUTENANT ROONEY For Pete's sake, that's the way they described him. \u00abHe looked like Karloff\u00bb. Why'd you have to knock him off ? \nBROPHY He tried to get us to go down to the cellar. He says there are thirteen bodies buried down there. \nLIEUTENANT ROONEY Thirteen bodies buried in the cellar, and that don't tip you off the guy's come from a nuthouse ? \nMORTIMER Thanks, pal. \nO'HARA Say, lieutenant, about my not ringing in, I want to explain... \nLIEUTENANT ROONEY Where have you been all night ? Don't bother to tell me. \nO'HARA Oh, I was right here writing a play with Mortimer Brewster. \nLIEUTENANT ROONEY Yeah ? \nO'HARA Yeah. \nLIEUTENANT ROONEY Well, you're going to have a long time on that play. \nO'HARA Yeah ? \nLIEUTENANT ROONEY You're suspended. Now go on. Report in. \nTeddy comes out of his room, with his bugle under his arm, and walks downstairs \nLIEUTENANT ROONEY (voice over) Take this guy out in the kitchen and bring a pillow. I want to find out where his accomplice is. \nTEDDY (to Mortimer) What is the meaning of this commotion ? \nLIEUTENANT ROONEY The guy who helped him escape. He's wanted, too. \nTeddy gives his bugle to Mortimer. \nTEDDY Here. \nHe joins the group of policemen. \nLIEUTENANT ROONEY Forty-eight hours I've been after these guys. Nothing to eat. No sleep. No wonder Brooklyn's in the shape it's in. With flatheads like you on the force. Falling for a story like that ! Thirteen bodies buried down in the cellar. \nTEDDY But there are thirteen bodies in the cellar ! \nLIEUTENANT ROONEY Who are you ? \nTEDDY I'm President Roosevelt. \nLIEUTENANT ROONEY (whispering to Brophy) What the blazes is this ? \nBROPHY He's the guy that blows the bugle. SAUNDERS Howdy, Colonel. \nSaunders and Brophy both salutes Teddy. Teddy salutes them back. Rooney raises his hand to salute, but rapidly puts it down with a disgusted expression on his face. \nLIEUTENANT ROONEY Well, Colonel, you've blown your last bugle. (pointing to Jonathan's body) Come on, get this guy out of here. \nTEDDY Dear me ! Another yellow-fever victim ? \nLIEUTENANT ROONEY What ? \nTEDDY All the bodies in the cellar are yellow-fever victims. BROPHY No-no-no, Colonel. This is a spy. We caught him at the White House. \nLIEUTENANT ROONEY Take him out and bring him to. I want to question him. \nBrophy and Saunders lift Jonathan and carry him to the kitchen. \nTEDDY If there is any questioning of spies, that's my department. \nHe follows the two cops. But Rooney stops him. \nLIEUTENANT ROONEY Hey, you, keep out of that. \nTEDDY You're forgetting that as President, I am also head of the Secret Service. \nHe follows the two cops in the kitchen. Rooney goes to the table, takes the carafe and smells it. Mortimer watches him, still seated on his step. \nMORTIMER Huh-huh-huh ! \nRooney puts the carafe back on the table, and looks at Mortimer. \nLIEUTENANT ROONEY Who are you ? What's your name ? \nMORTIMER Usually, I'm Mortimer Brewster. But I'm not quite myself today. \nLIEUTENANT ROONEY Oh, you're his brother. Now, look, Mister Brewster, no argument. He's got to be put away. \nMortimer stands up and goes down the steps toward the lieutenant. \nMORTIMER No, no, no arguments, Captain. No arguments. Just a minute, take it easy. Read this. \nHe takes the papers from his pocket and show them to Rooney. \nMORTIMER Teddy's going to go to Happy Dale tonight. I'm just waiting here for Mr. Witherspoon. \nRooney looks at the documents. \nLIEUTENANT ROONEY Well, as long as he's going someplace. He's scaring the neighbors, what with that bugle and all. And that cockeyed story about thirteen bodies being buried... Rooney stops, looks around with a suspicious eye and takes his hat off. \nLIEUTENANT ROONEY You know, I've been without sleep for forty-eight hours. I'm liable to think anything. \nMORTIMER I know just how you feel. \nLIEUTENANT ROONEY There's people dumb enough to believe a story like that. Last year there was a crazy guy, started a murder rumor. I had to dig up a half acre plot before I could prove... Ohh ! What's this ? \nRooney puts the papers down. \nMORTIMER What's the matter ? \nLIEUTENANT ROONEY These papers are no good. \nRooney comes toward them with the documents in his hand. \nMORTIMER Captain, this is Mister Witherspoon. Witherspoon looks at Rooney with a smile. \nWITHERSPOON Oh, yes, yes, he'll be very happy at Happy Dale. Come, my boy. \nWitherspoon takes Rooney's arm. Rooney pushes him away. \nLIEUTENANT ROONEY What is this? \nMORTIMER No, no, no-no, Mister Witherspoon, you got it wrong. This is... this is Captain Rooney. \nWITHERSPOON The police ?... Oh ! \nThe two men shake hands, and Rooney gives the papers to Witherspoon. \nLIEUTENANT ROONEY I'm sure! Here are the papers, all signed. Now you can take him away, Super. \nTeddy joins them. \nTEDDY I'll be in my office vetoing some bills. \nMORTIMER Mister President, I have good news for you. Your term of office is over. \nTEDDY Is this March the four ? MORTIMER Practically. \nTEDDY Let's see... Oh ! Now I go on my hunting trip to Africa ! Well, I must get started immediately. \nTeddy starts walking away, but he stops suddenly and gives Witherspoon a suspicious look. \nTEDDY Is he trying to move into the White House before I've moved out ? \nMORTIMER Who, Mister President ? \nTeddy looks at Witherspoon with a disgusted face. \nTEDDY Taft ! MORTIMER No, no, Teddy this isn't Mister Taft. It's Mister Witherspoon, he's going to be your guide to Africa. \nTeddy shakes hands with Witherspoon. \nTEDDY Bully ! Bully ! Wait right here. I'll bring down my equipment. \nWitherspoon looks at Teddy walking away with a sweet smile. \nWITHERSPOON Happy man. \nTeddy starts going upstairs and he meets Abby and Martha coming down. They're dressed back in their usual clothes. Teddy shakes hands with them. \nTEDDY Goodbye, Aunt Abby, goodbye Aunt Martha. I'm on my way to Africa. Isn't it wonderful ? \nFor the last time, Teddy takes out his imaginary sword, points it forward and rushes upstairs. \nTEDDY Charge ! \nHe gets into his room and slams the door behind him. Witherspoon looks a bit surprised, and Mortimer holds the hands of the grandfather clock. Abby joins him \nMORTIMER It's all right, Aunt Abby, I've got it. \nWitherspoon looks at the scene with slightly anxious eyes. WITHERSPOON Oh, dear. And Happy Dale is full of staircases. \nBREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nElaine walks across the churchyard toward the Brewster's house. She is wearing a coat over her nightdress. \nBREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nAbby and Martha are talking with Witherspoon. \nMARTHA You've come to meet Teddy, haven't you ? \nLIEUTENANT ROONEY (voice over) No, he's come to take him. Teddy's been blowing his bugle again. \nBoth sisters turn toward Rooney. ABBY Oh, no-no, no, he can't go now ! We won't permit it. \nMARTHA We promise to take his bugle away from him. We won't be separated from Teddy. \nLIEUTENANT ROONEY I'm sorry. \nABBY Mortimer, how can you allow this ? You promised. \nLIEUTENANT ROONEY Mister Brewster's got nothing to do with this, see. The law is the law ! Teddy's committed himself and he's got to go. \nABBY Well, if he's going, we're going, too ! \nMARTHA Yes, you'll have to take us with him. \nMortimer smiles broadly. \nMORTIMER Why-why... why not ? Why not, indeed ? \nWITHERSPOON Oh well now, indeed, it's sweet of them to want to go, but it's quite impossible. We never take sane people at Happy Dale. \nMortimer comes very close to Witherspoon, and tries, by mime only, to induce Witherspoon to take his aunts. \nWITHERSPOON Oh, no-no-no-no... MORTIMER (whispering) Now, these two little sane people, mixed up with all the others, will get lost in the shuffle. You could arrange that. \nWITHERSPOON Oh, no-no-no-no... \nMORTIMER Just put them in and they'll get all mixed up. \nWITHERSPOON Oh, no ! No, no ! No ! Too dangerous. Dissension, jealousy. \nBREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nElaine has now reached the Brewster house and opens a window. We hear Lieutenant Rooney's voice. \nLIEUTENANT ROONEY (voice over) Now, let's be sensible, ladies... \nBREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nRooney is talking to the Brewster sisters. \nLIEUTENANT ROONEY ...Here I am wasting my time when I could be doing some serious work. You know, ladies, there are still murders to be solved in Brooklyn. It ain't only his bugle blowing, and neighbors being afraid of him. But things are going to get worse. We're liable to have to dig up your cellar. \nABBY Our cellar ? \nLIEUTENANT ROONEY Yeah. \nMortimer seems a bit worried. \nMORTIMER Oh-oh ! \nABBY (voice over) Right here ? \nWITHERSPOON (voice over) Yes, please. It's on the right-hand side right there. \nMartha and Abby are seated at the table, signing the papers. Witherspoon and Mortimer, standing besides them, are helping them. \nABBY I'm really looking forward to going. The neighborhood here has changed so. \nMARTHA Yes. Especially since they won that old pennant thing. \nWITHERSPOON Oh... oh, dear, I'm so sorry. We've overlooked something. It's absolutely compulsory that we have the signature of a physician. \nEinstein has reached the bottom of the stairs and he is sneaking out through the front door. \nMORTIMER A doctor... Oh ! Doctor Einstein ! Come here and sign some papers, please. \nEinstein turns around. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN Good night. \nMORTIMER Come here, Doctor Einstein. \nWITHERSPOON A doctor ? \nMORTIMER Oh, yes, yes. Doctor Einstein almost operated on me earlier this evening. Come on, Doctor. \nEinstein drops his suitcase by the front door, and comes to the table. \nMORTIMER Here. Just sign right here, please, Doctor. Einstein signs the paper Mortimer gives him. Meanwhile, Rooney and Saunders are coming out of the kitchen and crossing the room. \nABBY Were you leaving, Doctor ? \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN Yes, please. \nMARTHA Oh ! Aren't you going to wait for Jonathan ? \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN I don't think we go to the same place. \nLIEUTENANT ROONEY (speaking on the telephone) Hello, Mac. We picked up that guy that's wanted in Indiana. His accomplice's description is one on the circular, on the desk. Read it to me, will you ? \nEinstein leaves the table, and almost bumps into Saunders, who is brushing his uniform. He listen to the description of himself that Rooney is repeating from his colleague at the police station. \nLIEUTENANT ROONEY (still on the phone) Yeah... About forty... Five-foot-three... One hundred and forty pounds... Pop eyes... Talks with a German accent... Poses as a doctor... Okay, Mac. Thanks. \nHe puts the phone back on its hook. \nWitherspoon slaps Einstein on the back, and Einstein starts raising his arms. \nWITHERSPOON It's all right, Lieutenant Rooney. The doctor here has completed the signatures. \nLIEUTENANT ROONEY Oh, that's great ! Thanks, Doc. You've done Brooklyn a great service. \nHe shakes Einstein's hand and slaps his back. Einstein cannot believe his luck. He smiles and rushes to the door. \nABBY But Dr. Einstein ! \nEinstein picks up his suitcase, and rushes out of the door, and closes it behind him. \nWITHERSPOON (to Mortimer) Now, Mister Witherspoon... \nMORTIMER No, no, you're Mister Witherspoon, I'm Mister Brewster. WITHERSPOON (laughing) It's contagious, yes. It's your turn. \nMORTIMER Now, don't play games... \nWITHERSPOON You sign. You sign as next of kin. \nMORTIMER Oh, next of kin. Why didn't you say so ? I'm all confused. Don't mind me. \nTeddy appears on the balcony, all dressed up in his colonial costume, but without the helmet. \nTEDDY Mr. Witherport. \nWITHERSPOON Spoon. Mortimer picks up a spoon on the table and gives it to Witherspoon. \nMORTIMER Oh, here it is. \nTEDDY Come up and pack my duffel. \nWITHERSPOON Duffel ? \nMORTIMER Yes, duffel. Pack his duffel. He's President, you know ? \nWITHERSPOON Oh ! \nTEDDY And bring along my bugle. \nWitherspoon looks on the table, where the bugle is, and then at Mortimer. Mortimer makes a little agreement sign. \nMORTIMER President. \nWitherspoon picks up the bugle, and starts walking upstairs. He stops after a few steps, as if he were hesitating. \nMORTIMER Don't charge ! \nMortimer and Witherspoon are exchanging faces. Martha and Abby are whispering into each other's ear. \nABBY Mortimer. Mortimer, we're really very worried about something. \nMORTIMER Oh, now, darling, don't be worried. \nHe kisses Abby. \nMARTHA Me too, Mortimer. \nMORTIMER Well, of course, darling. \nHe kisses Martha. \nMORTIMER You'll both are going to be very happy at Happy Dale, will you. \nMARTHA Oh yes, dear, we're very happy about the whole thing, but that's just it. We don't want anything to go wrong. \nMORTIMER Well, what would go wrong ? \nABBY Mortimer, will they investigate those signatures ? \nMORTIMER Oh, no, they won't look up Dr. Einstein... \nMARTHA But it's not his signature, dear. It's yours. \nMORTIMER Mine ? \n", "test1_input": "BROPHY They don't rent rooms. But you can bet if anybody came looking for a room, they wouldn't go away without a good meal and probably a couple of bucks in their pockets. That's just their way of digging up people to do good to. \nWe get a closer view of the front of the house. A large rectangular stone, with \u00abBrewster\u00bb engraved on it. A group of children runs in front of the house. \nBREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nIn the forefront of the room, Teddy Brewster is playing Mozart's Turkish March on the harpsichord. He looks a bit like late President Theodore Roosevelt. And he is dressed like the President was dressed on the official pictures we've got of him... And, like the President, he is wearing a pince-nez. \nIn another corner of the room, Abby Brewster is having tea with Reverend Harper, Elaine's father. She looks like an old English lady, a bit like Agatha Christie's Miss Marple. \nABBY Reverend Harper, I do hope you don't disapprove of Mortimer just because he's a dramatic critic and takes your daughter to the theater every night. \nREVEREND HARPER It's not so much that I disapprove of his being a critic, but no man, no man with this published attitude on marriage... \nClose-up on the book Reverend Harper just took on the table : \u00abMarriage, a Fraud and a Failure, by Mortimer Brewster\u00bb. REVEREND HARPER ...should take any man's daughter anyplace... \nHe sneezes. \nREVEREND HARPER ...at any time. \nHe sneezes again, louder this time. Teddy stops playing and there is a puzzled look in his eyes. \nTEDDY I must be catching cold. \nABBY (to Teddy) No, dear. It was Reverend Harper who sneezed. (to Reverend Harper) Bless you. \nTeddy puts back in his pocket the handkerchief he had taken out and starts playing again. \nABBY We mustn't be angry with Mortimer. He's so very much in love with her. And Sister Martha and I are so happy about it. He used to come to see us only occasionally, and now, now he's in Brooklyn six nights a week. \nBREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR DAY \nThe two cops, Brophy and O'Hara, are mounting the steps to the Brewster sisters house. \nBROPHY Remember now, watch your language. \nO'HARA Besides, you know I'm not a swearing man. \nBROPHY You'd be surprised what they'd consider swearing. \nHe rings the doorbell. \nBREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nAt the sound of the doorbell, Teddy stops playing. \nABBY Oh, will you excuse me ? \nShe gets up from her armchair. \nABBY No, no, Teddy, dear. Thank you. I'll go. \nShe goes to the door and opens it. \nABBY Oh, come right in, Mr. Brophy. \nThe two cops get in. \nBROPHY Miss Abby, we came for the toys. \nABBY Oh yes. \nO'Hara closes the door. \nBROPHY This is Officer O'Hara. He's taking over my beat. \nO'HARA How are you doing ? \nABBY May I welcome you to our neighborhood, Mister O'Hara. \nTeddy, with his teacup in hand, joins the group. He speaks with a very serious expression on his face. \nTEDDY Gentlemen, what news have you brought me ? \nBrophy salutes him and stands at attention. \nBROPHY Colonel, we have nothing to report. \nTeddy gives an intrigued look to O'Hara, who doesn't seem to understand. Brophy elbows him with the arm which is still saluting. \nO'HARA Huh ? He eventually understands what his Sargent is trying to tell him. \nO'HARA Oh no, absolutely nothing to report. \nHe salutes but with a less official attitude than his Sargent. Teddy smiles. \nTEDDY Splendid ! Thank you, gentlemen. (very serious again) At ease. \nBrophy puts his arm down. O'Hara looks at his Sargent with a perplexed expression, and takes longer to put his arm down \nABBY You know the Reverend Doctor Harper from the church next door ? \nBROPHY Hello, Reverend. This is Officer O'Hara, the new man on the beat. \nTeddy looks at O'Hara with a puzzled expression. \nO'HARA How do you do, sir ? It's nice to meet you. \nO'Hara looks ill at ease under Teddy's stare. \nABBY The toys are on the chair up here, by the library door. \nO'Hara moves toward the pile of toys. Teddy's eyes are following him with the same puzzled expression. O'Hara feels less and less at ease. \nABBY Oh, Teddy, will you run upstairs and bring down your Army and Navy from Aunt Martha's room. They're all packed. \nREVEREND HARPER That's splendid work you men do, fixing up discarded toys for the kids at camp. \nTeddy, who has started to mount the stairs to the upper level, stops in his stride, pretends he is taking a sword out of a sheath at his side, points this imaginary sword in front of him and starts running up the stairs, yelling : \nTEDDY Charge ! \nWhen he arrives on the balcony, on which open the bedroom doors, he rushes into his room and slams the door. \nWhile Bophy and Reverend Harper remain unmoved, O'Hara, who is standing by the grandfather's clock, jumps and looks at the clock, which chimes once. The minute hand of the clock falls down to the half-hour position. O'Hara is very disturbed and points his stick to his Sargent, who seems to be totally unmoved by the event and laughs with Reverend Harper and Abby. \nBROPHY It gives us something to do as we are sitting around the station. You get tired of playing cards. \nAbby moves away from them to the grandfather's clock. She puts the minute hand back into its original position. Brophy and Reverend Harper joins her by the clock. \nBROPHY So these are the toys ? \n", "test1_true": "ABBY How's Missis Brophy ? \nBROPHY Oh, she's better, thank you. But a little weak, still. \nABBY Well, I'll better get some beef broth for you to take to her. \nBROPHY Oh, Miss Abby, please don't bother. You've done so much already. \nABBY Oh, Stuff and nonsense ! I won't be a minute. \nShe moves away and exits into the kitchen. \nREVEREND HARPER Gentlemen, if I know what pure kindness and absolute generosity are, it's because I've known the Brewster sisters. \nOn the balcony, Teddy gets out of his room with a bugle, and starts playing it very loudly. O'Hara jumps and drops the box with the toys on the floor. Reverend Harper and Brophy seem to be less moved by the event. \nBrophy stands back and points his finger up to Teddy. \nBROPHY Oh, Teddy, you promised me you wouldn't do that anymore. \nTeddy, still standing on the balcony, answers him leaning on the balustrade. \nTEDDY But I have to call a Cabinet meeting to get the release of those supplies. \nBROPHY Now don't do that again. Do you hear me ? \nTeddy goes back into his room, slamming the door behind him. The grandfather's clock chimes once, and the minute hand falls back to the half-hour position. O'Hara jumps and looks at the clock. \nBROPHY He used to do that in the middle of the night, and neighbors raised Cain with me. They're a little afraid of him anyway. \nO'HARA Look, Sarge, I promised you I wouldn't swear, but what the heck... \nHe stops in the middle of his sentence, gives a quick look to Reverend Harper, and corrects himself. \nO'HARA ...What's going on here anyway ? \nREVEREND HARPER Oh, he's quite harmless. \nBROPHY He thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt. So what, there's a lot of worse guys he could think he was. \nO'HARA Huh ? \nO'Hara gives a quick look toward the upper landing, and then nods. \nO'HARA That's right. I'll make a note of it. He's a very interesting character. \nBROPHY Isn't it a shame, Father, isn't it a shame, Reverend, that a nice family like this should be hatching a cuckoo ? \nThe front door opens and Martha Brewster comes in. Like her sister, she looks like an old English lady. She is wearing a short cape and a hat, and she carries a cylindrical can with a handle. \nShe closes the door. \nMARTHA Oh, well, now, isn't this nice ! \nShe goes to Brophy and the Reverend. \nBROPHY Good afternoon, Miss Brewster. \nMARTHA How do you do, Mr Brophy ? \nREVEREND HARPER Good afternoon, Miss Brewster. O'Hara has picked up the toys and he joins the group. \nMARTHA Reverend Harper, how do you do ? \nBROPHY Oh, Miss Martha, this is Officer O'Hara. He's taking over my duties. \nO'HARA How do you do, ma'am ? \nMARTHA I'm very glad to know you. \nAbby comes out of the kitchen, carrying a cylindrical can, similar to the one her sister is carrying \nO'HARA Thank you. Abby joins the group. \nABBY Oh, Martha, you're back. \nShe gives the can to Brophy. Meanwhile, Martha has taken her cape off. \nABBY Here's the broth for Missis Brophy. Be sure it's good and hot. \nBROPHY You bet I will, and thank you very much. \nTeddy is getting down the stairs, carrying a box full of toys under his arm. He stops a few steps from floor level \nTEDDY The Army and Navy are ready for action. \nHe resumes his walking down the stairs. \nBROPHY Oh, Colonel, this is grand. It'll make a lot of kids happy. \nBrophy takes the box from Teddy. Teddy looks into the box O'Hara is carrying, and takes a model warship out of the box. \nTEDDY What's this ? The Oregon ? \nMARTHA Oh, Teddy, dear, put it back. \nShe has taken her hat off. \nTEDDY But the Oregon goes to Australia. \nABBY Now, Teddy... \nTeddy tucks the model ship under his arm. O'Hara looks at him with puzzled eyes. \nTEDDY No, it goes to Australia. \nBROPHY These are lovely. Thank you very much. \nABBY Not at all. \nBrophy moves toward the front door. O'Hara follows him, still looking at Teddy. Teddy doesn't seem to like the way he looks at him, and moves the toy ship away from him. \nBROPHY The children will go crazy. \nHe has reached the front door. Abby has moved near the door, ready to open it for him. \nABBY Oh, now, don't mention it. \nO'Hara salutes Teddy. \n", "test1_id": 2235, "test2_input": "Teddy stops a few steps from floor level. \nTEDDY Oh, that's my daughter, Alice. \nELAINE Oh, no, Teddy ! Teddy ! \nTEDDY Now, Alice, don't be a tomboy. Don't play rough with the gentlemen. He pulls out his imaginary sword and rushes up the stairs. \nTEDDY Charge ! \nHe rushes into his room and slams the door. \nELAINE Teddy ! \nElaine starts screaming. Jonathan holds a handkerchief over her mouth. Einstein runs to the front door and switches the lights off. \nJONATHAN Doctor, the cellar. \nELAINE Let go of me ! Let go of me ! \nThe cellar door is opened, and we see the shadows of the two men dragging Elaine down to the cellar. MARTHA What's the matter ? What's happening down there ? \nThe lights are switched back on, and we see Abby and Martha on the balcony, just coming out of their room. They are both dressed in black funeral clothes. \nABBY What's the matter ? What are you doing there ? \nJonathan is coming alone out of the cellar. \nJONATHAN We caught a burglar, a sneak thief. Go back to your room. \nABBY We'll call the police. \nShe starts going down the stairs, followed by Martha. \nJONATHAN I'll handle this. Go back to your room. \nAbby stops at the top of the stairs. \nJONATHAN Do you hear me ? \nKnocking on the door, followed by the doorbell. The two sisters starts going down the stairs. \nJONATHAN Don't answer that. \nAnother doorbell. The two sisters are running downstairs. \nJONATHAN Don't answer that ! \nElaine rushes through the cellar door, screaming. She runs into Martha's arms, followed by Einstein. \nELAINE Let go of me ! \nMore knocking and ringing at the door. Abby goes and opens the door. Mortimer enters the house.. \nMORTIMER Where's Teddy ? Is he upstairs ? \nElaine rushes to Mortimer and holds him by the neck. He gets rid of her. \nMORTIMER Never mind that now, darling, please. \nHe starts climbing the stairs and looks, surprised, at Martha. MORTIMER What are you doing with your best clothes on ? \nHe suddenly notices Jonathan's presence and stops mounting the stairs. \nMORTIMER Holy... What's that ? What's that thing there that looks like a cigar-store dummy ? \nABBY It's your brother Jonathan, and this is Doctor Einstein. \nMORTIMER Aunt Abby, didn't I tell you not to let anybody in the house ? Who did you say it was ? \nABBY It's your brother, Jonathan ! \nElaine grabs Mortimer's coat, and starts talking to him. So do Abby and Martha on either side of him. Since the three of them are talking together, it is impossible to understand what they say. \nJONATHAN I've come back home, Mortimer. \nAt the voice of Jonathan, the three women stop talking \nMORTIMER What ? \nJONATHAN I've come back home, Mortimer. \nMORTIMER \u00abI've come back home, Mortimer.\u00bb Listen, it talks ! JONATHAN Yes, I talk. Mortimer, have you forgotten the things I used to do to you when you were tied to the bedpost ? The needles under your fingernails. \nElaine grabs Mortimer's coat. \nELAINE Mortimer, he... \nMORTIMER Wait a minute. \nMortimer walks closer to Jonathan. \nMORTIMER Holy mackerel ! It is Jonathan ! \nJONATHAN I'm glad you remember, Mortimer. \nMORTIMER Yeah, I remember. How could I forget you ? Where'd you get that face ? Hollywood ? \nJonathan is ready to fight with his brother. Einstein grabs his arm to stop him and Abby comes between them. \nABBY Oh, don't you two boys start quarreling again the minute you've seen each other. \nMARTHA We invited Jonathan and Doctor Einstein to stay. \nMORTIMER What ? \nMARTHA Just for tonight. \nMORTIMER Oh no, you don't, I'm staying here tonight. In fact, I'm staying here from now on. \nElaine taps on Mortimer's arm. \nELAINE Mortimer, what about me ? \nMORTIMER There's no room for anybody else in the house. (to Elaine) Please, darling, just a moment. (to Jonathan) So take that little squirt and beat it ! (to Martha) Now where's Teddy ? I've got to see him right away. Is he upstairs ? He starts climbing the stairs. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN Mister Brewster ! We don't take up much room. Johnny can sleep on the sofa, and I'll sleep on the window-seat. \nMORTIMER Nothing to... \nHe stops going upstairs \n", "test2_true": "He comes back downstairs. \nMORTIMER Certainly not on the window-seat. I'm going to sleep on the window-seat. \nHe crosses the room to sit on the window-seat. MORTIMER I'm going to sleep on the windows-eat from now on. \nELAINE Mortimer ! \nMortimer stands up and goes to Jonathan \nMORTIMER Now look. Now look, Jonathan. Now, be a good fellow. Here's ten dollars. Go out and haunt yourself a hotel. \nJonathan throws Mortimer's money on the floor. Mortimer tries to step on it, but instead, he steps on Jonathan's foot. \nJONATHAN Mortimer, you know what I do to people who order me around. \nEinstein pulls Jonathan's sleeve. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN Hey, Johnny. Mister Spenalzo. \nMortimer bends down to look at Jonathan foot, then he touches his legs. \nJONATHAN What ? \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN What's going to happen to Mister Spenalzo ? \nMortimer takes a fork on the table and stabs Jonathan's leg with it. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN We can't leave him here in the window-seat. Johnny ? JONATHAN Doctor, you know, Doctor, I've completely lost track of Mister Spenalzo. \nMORTIMER Wait ! Who's this Mister Spenalzo ? \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN A friend of ours Johnny was looking for. \nMORTIMER Don't you bring anyone else in here. Now, come on, beat it, both of you ! \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN It's all right, Johnny. While we are packing, I'll tell you about him. \nJonathan walks to the staircase, and starts going upstairs, followed by Einstein. He stops a few steps before he reaches the balcony. JONATHAN I'll take care of you, Mortimer, in just a little while. \nHe resumes his walking upstairs. \nMORTIMER How do you like that ? The guy stays away for twenty years and picks tonight of all nights to come back. Oh, Elaine, what are you doing here ? \nShe falls in his arms. \nELAINE Mortimer ! \nMORTIMER What's the matter, darling ? \nELAINE I almost got killed. \nMORTIMER Killed ? Aunt Abby, Aunt Martha ! \nABBY Oh, no ! \nMARTHA Oh, no ! It was Jonathan ! \nABBY He mistook her for a sneak thief. \nMORTIMER Oh, that. \nMartha just found the shoe on the table and seems very intrigued by it. ELAINE (voice over) It was worse than that. He's some kind of a maniac. \nAbby looks at the shoe, and seems also very intrigued. Martha whispers something to her. \nMORTIMER (voice over) I know, darling, I know. \nELAINE (voice over) Oh, Mortimer, I'm afraid of him. \nMORTIMER (voice over) Oh, darling, don't worry about it. I'm here now. Now forget it. \nAbby whispers back to Martha, who puts the shoe back on the table. The two sisters move away. \nELAINE We were married today, we were going over Niagara Falls in a barrel, your brother tries to strangle me, a taxi's waiting, and now you want to sleep on a window-seat ! \nMortimer hardly listens to her, but catches the last word. \nMORTIMER Window seat... Witherspoon. Darling, you'd better run along home. \nELAINE What ? \nMORTIMER Yes, yes. Go home like a good girl. I got things to do. \nHe sits at the desk and starts dialing on the telephone. \nELAINE Mortimer ? But... but... \nMORTIMER No, no, please. (in the phone) Hello ? Operator ? Get me Happy Dale 2-7-0, please. \nELAINE But, Mortimer, didn't you hear what I was just saying ? \nMORTIMER Yes, 2-7-0. \nELAINE Your own brother Jonathan, he was trying to strangle me ! MORTIMER Please ! This is important ! \nELAINE That ? \nMORTIMER Hello ? Oh, hello, Mr. Witherspoon ? This is Mortimer Brewster. \nWITHERSPOON'S OFFICE - INTERIOR NIGHT \nWitherspoon is sitting behind his desk, the telephone receiver to his ear. \nWITHERSPOON Yes, Mr. Brewster, yes. \nHe puts an effervescent pill in a glass of water. \nWITHERSPOON Well, I don't understand you. BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nElaine is crying, standing near the desk, where Mortimer is still on the telephone. \nMORTIMER (in the phone) Look, look, I... \nHe raises his head to look at Elaine \nELAINE He was going to kill me ! \nMORTIMER (to Elaine) Wait a minute, I can't hear the man. (to Witherspoon on the phone) What ? I've got the papers all drawn up. I know it's late, but I want you to come down here and get my brother immediately ! I's got to be done. (to Elaine) Please, darling, please. \n", "test2_id": 2236, "test3_input": "O'HARA All of a sudden, a fire breaks out. What an effect ! The firemen rush in and who do you think is leading them ? Mayor Fiorello La Guardia ! \nO'Hara turns around and sees Jonathan lying on the last steps of the stairs. \nO'HARA What's the matter with him ? \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN Yeah, probably your play put him to sleep. \nO'HARA What ? \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN I personally, I like it very much. \nO'HARA It's probably over his head, huh ? \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN Yeah. O'Hara looks at Jonathan's face. \nO'HARA Where have I seen that face before ? \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN No, please. \nHe kneels beside Jonathan's body, and O'Hara returns to Mortimer. \nO'HARA Well, the scene changes. It's an evolving stage. I'm walking along my beat, well, like that, casual-like, when a guy that I'm following, it turns out he's really following me ! \nKnocks at the door. O'Hara turns to Einstein. \nO'HARA (to Einstein) Don't let nobody in. (to Mortimer) I figure I'll outsmart him. There's a vacant house on the corner. \nEinstein peeks through the drapes to have a look at the outside of the front door. He rushes to Jonathan. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN Hey, Johnny, the cops ! \nEinstein tries to wake up Jonathan, but doesn't succeed. He picks up his shoe and rushes upstairs. \nO'HARA So, I ducks in there. I sees the door handle turn, so I pulls out my gun, braces myself against the wall and I says : \u00abCome in !\u00bb \nHe takes out his gun and points it at the door. Brophy and another cop, officer Saunders, come in. When they see O'Hara's gun pointing at them, they raise their arms. O'Hara puts his gun back in his holster and welcomes his colleagues. \nO'HARA Oh, hello, boys. \nBROPHY What the Sam Hill's going on here ? \nO'HARA Hello Sarge, what do you think, this is Mortimer Brewster. He's going to help me write my play. \nSAUNDERS Do you have to tie him up to make him listen ? \nHe starts to untie Mortimer. BROPHY O'Hara, you better report in the station. Why didn't you ring in ? You got the whole force out looking for you. \nO'HARA Right in the middle of the second act. Did they send you guys here looking for me ? \nBrophy goes to the telephone and starts dialing. \nBROPHY No, we came to warn the old ladies. There is a difficulty. The colonel blew that bugle again. \nO'HARA Yeah, I heard him. \nBROPHY The neighbors are all phoning in. The Lieutenant's on the warpath. He says we've got to put him away someplace. \nHe sees Jonathan lying on the steps. BROPHY Now, who the heck is this ? \nO'HARA Oh, that's Mister Brewster's brother. My play put him to sleep. \nBROPHY Oh ! That's the one that ran away. So he came back. (in the phone) Brophy. Get me Mac. (to O'Hara) Haven't you got yourself in a mess ! You're two hours overdue at the station. I better let them know that I found you. \nO'Hara bends on Jonathan and shakes him \nO'HARA Hey ! It wasn't that bad, was it ? \nBROPHY (in the phone) Mac ? Tell the Lieutenant he can call off the big manhunt. We found him... At the Brewster house... Shall we bring him in ?... All right, we'll hold him right here. \nHe puts the phone down and turns to O'Hara, who has succeeded in waking up Jonathan and getting him on his feet. Jonathan stares at Brophy. He thinks Brophy is talking about him. \nMortimer looks at his left hand, which has just been freed by Saunders. \nBROPHY The Lieutenant is on his way over. JONATHAN So I've been turned in, hey ? All right, you've got me. I suppose you and my stool-pigeon brother will split the reward. \nBrophy and O'Hara each take one arm of Jonathan. \nBROPHY & O'HARA Reward ? \nJONATHAN Yes, reward ! Now I'll do some turning in ! \nMortimer, who had his hand and legs untied by Saunders but is still gagged and has his chest still tied on the armchair, moans and moves excitedly on his seat. \nO'HARA (to Jonathan) Oh, wait a minute, Mr. Brewster. \nJONATHAN You think my aunts are sweet, charming old ladies, don't you ? Well, there's thirteen bodies buried in the cellar ! Yes, thirteen. \nMortimer jumps on his chair and try to scream through his gag. Since he cannot succeed to get off the chair, he stands up, still gagged and tied to the back of the chair and rushes to Brophy, carrying the armchair with him. \nBROPHY Be careful what you say about your aunts, they happen to be friends of ours. \nJONATHAN I'll show them to you. \nBROPHY Don't you make any trouble for them, do you hear me ! \nMortimer walks between Brophy and Jonathan, and tries to say something to Brophy through his gag. Saunders, behind Mortimer, keeps on untying him. \nBROPHY (to Mortimer) Never mind, Mr. Brewster. Leave him to me, I'll take care of him. \nJONATHAN (to O'Hara) You come down to the cellar. \nO'HARA (to Jonathan) Now, wait a minute. \nMortimer is still trying to talk through his gag to O'Hara and Brophy, and moves excitedly around the two cops. He moves so much that Saunders has stopped trying to untie him. \nJONATHAN Thirteen bodies. I'll show you where they're buried. \nO'HARA Oh, yeah ! \nBROPHY Go down to the cellar with him, O'Hara. \nJONATHAN Yes, come to the cellar. \nHe grabs O'Hara's hand and drags him to the cellar door. \nO'HARA Well, look, do I have to ? \nMortimer, still gagged, and still carrying his armchair like a backpack, tries to follow them, but Saunders moves him away. Mortimer runs round the table to try again to join the party going down to the cellar, with Saunders running behind him. \nO'HARA Sorry, maybe I don't want to go down to the cellar with him. \n", "test3_true": "BROPHY O'Hara, go on down the cellar with him ! \nMortimer then goes to O'Hara, but O'Hara doesn't realize Mortimer is coming to him to prevent him going down to the cellar. \nO'HARA Now, please, Mister Brewster. I'll tell you the rest of my play later. \nHe pushes Mortimer away from him. \nBROPHY Go on down to the cellar with him. \nO'HARA Gee, do I have to, Sarge ? Look at that puss. He looks like Boris Karloff. \nHearing that, Jonathan screams, jumps on O'Hara and puts his hand around his throat. \nO'HARA (to Jonathan) Don't ! (to Brophy) Sarge ! \nThe three cops and Jonathan starts fighting. A fist comes out of the battle and hits Mortimer on the chin. He staggers back to the center of the room, and falls on the floor. \nWe see Einstein cautiously appearing on the landing of the upper floor of the house. He slowly comes down the stairs. \nDown in the sitting-room, the fight goes on. Saunders falls on his back and Jonathan jumps on him. O'Hara, in his turn, jumps on Jonathan. Behind them, Mortimer is slowly getting up and getting rid of his ropes. Apparently, his fall has completely untied him. \nEinstein, watching this heated fight, moves back to the upper floor. \nMortimer gets rid of his gag, and slowly moves away from the battle. \nBROPHY (voice over) Look out, Pat !... Look out, Pat ! \nSAUNDERS (voice over) He's got a gun... \nBROPHY (voice over) I got him, Pat. Look out ! \nMORTIMER Fight. Go on and fight. \nMortimer climbs up a few steps on the staircase and sits down on a step. \nMORTIMER That's enough, that's enough. Everybody off. \nBROPHY (voice over) Pat ! Pat, look out! \nMortimer, still seated on the step, quietly gets his cigarette case from his pocket, takes a cigarette, puts the case back in his pocket, while we hears the noise of the battle still going on down below. \nMORTIMER Amazing... Such a fine day, too. All I did was cross the bridge and I was in Brooklyn. Amazing. Amazing, amazing. \nHe takes a matchbox from another pocket and lights his cigarette. Behind Mortimer, on the wall, we see the shadows of the men fighting. Then we see various objects falling around Mortimer. \nMORTIMER Don't... Don't bother me now. \nO'Hara is projected on the wall below the staircase, near the place where Mortimer is still quietly seated. MORTIMER Buddy, you could use this in the third act. \nO'HARA Oh yes, I got something better than this. Let me tell you... \nJonathan breaks a chair on his back. O'Hara staggers slightly. \nO'HARA I'll see you later. \nHe goes back in the battle. Jonathan gives him a heavy punch and O'Hara falls in the window-seat, closing the lid over himself in his fall. \nBack to Mortimer, still quietly smoking his cigarette, seated on the same step. He takes papers out of his pocket. \nMORTIMER I got the papers signed. There, they're all signed. What do I care ? Go ahead, go ahead, fight, fight, fight-fight- fight ! \nO'Hara cautiously lifts the lid of the window-seat, but seeing a chair flying in his direction, he slams it back shut. The chair hits the window-seat and breaks off in small pieces. \nBack to Mortimer on his steps. He puts the papers back in his pocket. \nMORTIMER I'd better call up and see if Witherspoon has left. \nHe puts his hand through the banister of the staircase to take the telephone on the desk, but he cannot reach it. \nMORTIMER Telephone. Hey ! \nAt this moment, Jonathan comes smashing on the wall below the staircase. He grabs the telephone and lifts it to throw it on the cops, bringing it within easy reach of Mortimer's hand. \nJONATHAN I'll get every one of you ! I hate cops. I'll brain the first one that comes near me ! \nMortimer picks up the telephone handset, and starts dialing. \nMORTIMER Yeah. A little higher, please, brother. \nJonathan is watching the cops around him, and he is not looking at all at his brother behind him. Without thinking about it, he lifts the telephone a little higher. \nMORTIMER Thank you very much. Yeah, that's fine. Jonathan suddenly realizes what Mortimer is doing and turns his head toward him. Brophy immediately comes behind him and hits him with his stick. Jonathan starts falling, and Mortimer has to pick up the telephone not to loose it. \nMORTIMER Oh ! Don't do that, please. \nBROPHY Get him, Pat. \nSaunders comes on the other side of Jonathan and hits him with his stick. \nMORTIMER (in the phone) Come on, doc... (to the cops) That won't have any effect. I've tried it before... \nJonathan falls heavily on the floor. MORTIMER Oh, it did. Dear me ! Isn't that amazing ? \nO'Hara slowly lifts the lid of the window-seat. \nSaunders bends on the motionless body of Jonathan \nMORTIMER Oh, dear. Wish I could relax like that. \nThe doorbell rings, and we see the shadow of a hatted man through the frosted glass. Mortimer looks at the door. \nMORTIMER Witherspoon ! \nBROPHY Come in. \nThe visitor enters. It's Lieutenant Rooney, a plain-cloth policeman. He closes the door behind him. Both Brophy and Saunders stand at attention. Mortimer puts the phone receiver back on its hook. O'Hara comes out of the window-seat, and, seeing his superior, stands at attention. Rooney walks to the body of Jonathan. \nLIEUTENANT ROONEY What has occurred ? \nBROPHY & SAUNDERS (speaking together) Well, we... \nLIEUTENANT ROONEY Never mind ! Didn't I tell you I'd handle this myself ? \nO'Hara comes out of the window-seat to join his colleagues. O'HARA Well, Lieutenant ! We were just acting in self-defense. \nLIEUTENANT ROONEY (pointing to the body of Jonathan) What happened ? He put up a fight ? \nBROPHY This isn't the one who blows the bugle. This is his brother. He tried to kill O'Hara. \n", "test3_id": 2237}

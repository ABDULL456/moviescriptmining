Cross my heart and hope to die. \nHe crosses his chest and spits on the floor. Then, he takes his aunts in his arms. \nTEDDY Now, let's see. How are we going to keep it a secret ? \nABBY Well, Teddy, I think you'd better get back down into the cellar. And then, when I turn out the lights, when everything's dark here, you come up and take the poor man down to the canal. Now get along, Teddy. \nTeddy crosses the room to the cellar door. \nABBY And we'll come down later and hold services. \nTeddy opens the door, and turns around. \nTEDDY Where is the poor devil ? \nABBY (voice over) In the window-seat. \nTEDDY It seems to be spreading. We've never had yellow fever there before. \nMARTHA Abby. I've never even seen Mister Hoskins ! \nABBY Oh, my goodness! That's right, you were out. Well, you just come right along and see him now. You know, he's really very nice looking, considering that he's a Methodist. \nBoth sisters go to the window-seat and are ready to lift the lid, when the drapes above the seat suddenly open wide, revealing a very menacing Jonathan. The two sisters back off, frightened. \nJonathan slowly climbs in through the window, and stands up on the window-seat. \nJONATHAN We're bringing the luggage through here. \nHe gets down from the window-seat. Then Einstein appears behind the window, carrying a suitcase. Jonathan helps him to bring the suitcase in the room. \nABBY Jonathan, your room is waiting for you. You can go right up. \nEinstein, still outside the window, gives Jonathan another suitcase. \nJONATHAN I'm afraid we don't keep Brooklyn hours. You two run along to bed. \nABBY Oh, but you must be very tired. Both of you. And we don't go to bed this early. \nJONATHAN It's time I came home to take care of you. Behind Jonathan, Einstein has come into the room and is closing the window, and then the drapes. \nJONATHAN (to Einstein) Take the bags upstairs. \nEinstein takes the two suitcases and starts moving away. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN For the instruments, I'll come back later. \nABBY Good night. \nEinstein slightly bows to Abby. \nJONATHAN Now, we'll all go to bed. \nABBY I'll wait until you're up and then turn out the lights. \nEinstein has already almost reached the balcony. Martha starts climbing, with Jonathan behind her. \nJONATHAN Run along, Aunt Martha. Just off the laboratory, Doctor. \nEverybody reaches the balcony. Einstein disappears at the end of the balcony, and Martha enters her room. Jonathan turns around and looks down at Abby. \nJONATHAN All right, Aunt Abby. \nABBY I'll be right up. \nJONATHAN Now, Aunt Abby ! Turn out the lights. \nAbby goes to the switch near the front door, and switches the lights off. The room is completely dark. \nAbby climbs the stairs, reaches the balcony, and walks slowly pass Jonathan, who is still standing at the same place. Then, she quickly enters the room she shares with her sister, who is holding the door open for her. \nJonathan moves along the balcony and starts climbing the stairs to the upper floor. He stops after a few steps, and sees the door of his aunts' room opening slowly. Abby comes out. \nJONATHAN Aunt Abby. \nAbby quickly goes back into the room and closes the door. Jonathan resumes his climbing. The camera moves down into total black darkness, and then into the room, where we see some light underneath the cellar door. We hear steps, and the door opens to reveal Teddy, still in his colonial costume, but without the helmet. He stops a few seconds, then starts crossing the room, only lit by light coming from underneath the kitchen door. We hear the lid of the window-seat creaking, and we guess Teddy has just opened it. Shuffling noises. Then we see the shadow of Teddy carrying something apparently heavy. We hear the cat screaming, and we guess Teddy must have stepped on its tail. When Teddy comes into the light from the open door of the cellar, we discover he is carrying a human body, which could only be Mr. Hoskins' one taken from the window-seat. Teddy turns around and starts going backward down the steps to the cellar. He stops a few seconds to close the door. Then we hear noises of something falling, and we guess that Teddy must have missed a step and fallen all the way down to the cellar. \nBlack screen during one second. \nEinstein is going down the staircase, lit only by a match he is holding in his hand. DOCTOR EINSTEIN He's all right, Johnny. \nWhen he gets on floor level, he meets Jonathan. \nJONATHAN I'll open the window. You go round and hand him through. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN But he's too heavy for me. \nHe burns his finger and blows the match. The scene becomes completely dark. We see only shadows. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN You go outside, Johnny, and push, and I'll stay here and pull. And then together we take him down to Panama. Huh ? \nJONATHAN All right. We must be quick. I'll take a look around outside the house. When I tap on the glass, you open the window. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN Yeah. \nJonathan moves to the front door, opens it, stops to look around, and then closes the door. \nEinstein walks slowly in the room. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN It's dark in here. \nHe bumps into something. We hear the lid of the window-seat creaking several times. Einstein light another match, and we discover he has fallen into the open window-seat, where he is now lying \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN Where am I ? Oh, here I am. \nHe slowly gets out of the seat. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN Who left this open ? \nJonathan taps on the window. Einstein blows the match and opens the window. \n", "test1_true": "We see only shadows in the dark, but we guess Jonathan is handing Mr. Spenalzo's corpse to Einstein, who will then put it in the window-seat. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN Okay, Johnny, wait a minute. Hand him over. Now I have him. \u00abAllez !\u00bb Up ! Now, wait a minute, Johnny. You lost a leg somewhere. Hey, help me. He's so heavy. Now I have him. Now I got him. \nJONATHAN Be careful. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN Oh, but his shoe came off. Help me, Johnny. He's so heavy. Now I've got him ! \nKnocking at the door. \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN Hey, Johnny, somebody's at the door. Go open, quick. I'll manage Spenalzo. Go, quick ! \nSome more knocking. We hear the creaking of the lid of the window- seat, and we guess Einstein is closing it. \nThe front door opens slowly, and Elaine enters the house. \nELAINE Mortimer ! Aunt Abby ! \nWe see the frightened face of Einstein. \nELAINE (voice over) Aunt Martha ! \nJonathan enters through the front door left open by Elaine, closes it and locks it. \nELAINE (looking frightened) Who is it ? Is that you, Teddy ? JONATHAN Who are you ? \nELAINE I'm Elaine Harper. I live next door. \nJONATHAN What are you doing here ? \nELAINE I came here to see my husband, Mortimer. \nJONATHAN Why did you say your name was Harper ? \nELAINE Well, it is Harper. I mean, it's Brewster. I'm not very used to it. I'm a brand-new Brewster. \nEinstein goes to the front door and switches the lights on. JONATHAN Doctor ! \nDOCTOR EINSTEIN It's all right, Johnny. It's okay. \nEinstein has his little bottle in one hand, and, with the finger of the other hand, he tries to explain to Jonathan that the corpse is safely in the window-seat. \nJonathan looks at Einstein, and then goes across the room to look around. He even moves the drapes of a window to look outside. \nELAINE (voice over) Maybe you'd better explain what you're doing here. \nJonathan keeps on checking around. He goes to the window above the window-seat, and looks outside. \nJONATHAN We happen to live here. \nHe spots an orphan shoe on the floor and picks it up. \nELAINE (voice over) You don't live here. I've been in this house every day, and I've never seen you before. Where are Miss Martha and Miss Abby ? What have you done to them ? \nEinstein tries to explain to Jonathan, without using words, that the shoe belongs to the corpse in the window-seat. \nJONATHAN Perhaps we'd better introduce ourselves. May I present Doctor Einstein ? He puts the shoe on the table, then lifts the tablecloth to look underneath it. \nELAINE Doctor Einstein ? \nJONATHAN A surgeon of great distinction. And something of a magician. \nELAINE Now I suppose you're gonna tell me that you're Boris... \nJONATHAN (cutting her very harshly) I am Jonathan Brewster. \nELAINE Oh ! You're Jonathan. \nJonathan comes close to her and looks at her in such a strange way that she starts walking backward. JONATHAN You've heard of me ? \nELAINE Yes, they talk about you. \nJONATHAN What do they say about me ? \nElaine stops walking backward. \nELAINE Oh, just that there's another brother named Jonathan, that's all they say. Oh, that explains everything. Now that I know who you are, I'll just be running along, if you'll kindly unlock the door. \nThey move to the front door, beside which Einstein is standing, smiling. Jonathan unlocks the door. He opens it a few inches, but stands in the way of Elaine, ready to got out. \nJONATHAN \u00abThat explains everything.\u00bb Just what do you mean by that ? Why do you come here at this time of night ? \nELAINE Well, I just thought I saw Mortimer drive up. I suppose it was you. \nJonathan slams the door and locks it. \nJONATHAN You thought you saw someone drive up ? \nHe walks menacingly toward her, and she starts walking backward across the room. ELAINE Yes. Weren't you just outside ? Isn't that your car ? \nJONATHAN You saw someone at the car ? \nELAINE Yes. \nEinstein starts walking behind Jonathan. \nJONATHAN What else did you see ? \nELAINE Oh, just that, that's all ! \nJONATHAN I see. Is that why you came over here ? \nELAINE Oh no, I came to see Mortimer. But if he's not home, I'll run... \nShe tries to run away, but Jonathan grabs her arms and holds it very firmly. \nJONATHAN You've given two names. \nELAINE You're hurting me ! \nJONATHAN I think she's dangerous. \nTeddy comes in through the cellar door. He has his helmet back on his head and wears heavy working gloves. \nTEDDY No visitors. It's going to be a private funeral. \nHe crosses the room and starts climbing the stairs. Both Jonathan and Einstein are now holding Elaine. \nELAINE Teddy !

Oh, holy mackerel ! I forgot the doctor ! Mortimer takes a piece of paper from the inside pockets of his jacket and puts it on the desk. Elaine is still whining at his side. ELAINE Mortimer ! \nMORTIMER (yelling to Elaine) Please, be quiet ! Can't you see I've got to get a doctor ? (to Witherspoon on the phone) Hello ? What kind of a doctor ? A family doctor ? \nELAINE You can take your honeymoon, your wedding ring, your taxi, your window-seat, and put them in a barrel, and push them all over Niagara Falls ! \nShe walks away \nMORTIMER (to the departing Elaine) Thank you, darling. Thank you. (to Witherspoon on the phone) Oh, look, why don't you come down here anyway ? While you're getting here, I'll get Teddy's and the doctor's signatures both. \nThe front door slams violently. Mortimer turns around. \nMORTIMER Yeah. Elaine ! Elaine ! (to Witherspoon) Yeah, I'll get both signatures. Yeah, well, come right away. \nHe puts the phone down. \nMORTIMER Elaine ? What's the matter with her ? \nHe stands up and runs across the room to the window-seat. \nMORTIMER Oh, dear ! \nHe kneels on the window-seat and looks through the open window. \nMORTIMER Elaine ! Elaine ! \nBREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nLarge shot of Reverend Harper's residence. Elaine enters the front door, and slams the door behind her. \nBREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nMortimer is still looking through the open window. \nMORTIMER Elaine ! \nHe enters back into the room, and sits on the window-seat. \nMORTIMER (whispering to himself) Oh, let me sit down. Let me think about this thing. Doctor, Teddy, signature... \nHe looks at the seat. \nMORTIMER Hoskins ! \nHe remains seated a few seconds in deep thought, then he gives a quick look outside the window, stands up and starts lifting the lid. The lid creaks. Mortimer seems very surprised by what he sees inside the seat. He opens the lid completely and let it rest on the bottom of the window. \nMORTIMER Ye gods ! There's another one ! He closes the lid and walks across the room toward the kitchen door. \nMORTIMER Aunt Abby ! Aunt Martha ! Come in here ! \nABBY (voice over from the kitchen) We're busy. \nMORTIMER No, you come in here now ! \nAbby, still in funeral clothes, enters the room through the kitchen door. \nABBY Yes, dear, what is it ? Where's Elaine ? \nMORTIMER Wait a minute. Didn't you promise me not to let anyone in the house while I was gone ? \nABBY Jonathan just walked in. \nMORTIMER I don't mean Jonathan ! \nABBY And Doctor... \nMORTIMER And I don't mean Doctor Einstein ! Who is that in the window-seat ? \nABBY We told you. Mister Hoskins. \nMORTIMER He is not Mister Hoskins ! \nHe opens the window-seat wide and let the lid rest on the bottom of the window. \nMORTIMER There ! \nAbby walks to the window-seat and looks inside, surprised. \nABBY Who can that be ? \nMORTIMER You're trying to tell me you've never seen that man before ? \nABBY I certainly am. Well, this is a fine how-do-you-do ! It's getting so anyone thinks he can walk in this house ! \nMORTIMER Now, you look here, Aunt Abby. Don't you try to get out of this ! That's another one of your gentlemen, and you know it ! \nABBY Mortimer, how can you say such a thing ? That man's an impostor. And if he came here to be buried in our cellar, he's mistaken. \nMORTIMER You admitted to me you put Mister Hoskins in the window- seat. \nABBY Yes, I did. \nMORTIMER Well, this man couldn't have got the idea from Mister Hoskins ! \nABBY Oh, no. \nMORTIMER By the way, where is Mister Hoskins ? \nMortimer starts looking around the room. \nABBY He must have gone to Panama. \nMORTIMER What ? You buried him ? \nABBY No, no, not yet. He's just down there waiting for the services, poor dear. We haven't had a minute, what with Jonathan in the house. \nMortimer suddenly realizes the corpse could be a \u00abfriend\u00bb of Jonathan. He quickly closes the lid. \nABBY Oh, dear. We've always wanted to hold a double funeral. But I will not read services over a total stranger ! \nShe walks back to the kitchen. Mortimer catches her. \nMORTIMER A total stranger.

And I've also decided that you're leaving, and I mean now. \nMORTIMER Listen, handsome. I'm in no mood to debate the question. Are you getting out, or am I throwing you out on your ear? \nJONATHAN I've led a strange life, Mortimer. \nAbby comes in through the kitchen door, followed by Martha. \nABBY Martha, you come straight along here. You just look and see what's in that window-seat. \nJonathan and Mortimer both rushes across the room and sit on the window-seat \nMORTIMER No. No, no, Aunt Abby, don't... \nHe stops when he realizes that Jonathan is sitting with him. He suddenly understands the situation, and shows a broad smile to his brother. He then stands up \nMORTIMER Jonathan, let Aunt Martha see what's in the window-seat. \nJonathan's face shows that he is no more so sure of himself. \nMORTIMER Aunt Abby, darling, I owe you an apology. \nHe kisses her on the forehead. \nMORTIMER I've got some very good news for you. Jonathan is leaving. And he's taking Doctor Einstein and that cold companion with him. (to Jonathan) Listen, Jonathan. You're my brother, you're a Brewster. So, I'm giving you a chance to get away and take the evidence with you. You can't ask for more than that. Well ? \nJonathan doesn't move from the window-seat. \nMORTIMER All right, in that case, I'll have to call the police. \nHe goes to the desk. \nJONATHAN Don't reach for the telephone. Remember, what happened to Mister Spenalzo can happen to you, too. \nMortimer picks up the phone. \nMARTHA Spenalzo ? \nABBY I knew he was a foreigner. \nJONATHAN Put down that telephone, Mortimer. \nJonathan puts his hand to his pocket, to take his gun. The doorbell rings and we see a policeman's shadow through the frosted glass. Jonathan stands up and Abby rushes to the door. \nABBY Oh... \nShe opens the door on O'Hara. He is smiling and he's got his stick in his hand. \nO'HARA Hello ! ABBY Oh, Officer O'Hara ! \nO'HARA I saw the lights and thought you might have sickness in the house... \nABBY No... \nHe looks around. \nO'HARA Oh, you got company ? Oh, I'm sorry I disturbed you. \nHe starts to walk back out, but Mortimer stops him. \nMORTIMER No ! Come in. \nABBY Yes, do come in. She closes the door behind him. \nMARTHA Come right in, Officer O'Hara. This is our nephew, Mortimer. \nThey shake hands, both smiling. \nO'HARA Oh, pleased to meet you. \nMORTIMER And glad to see you, fellow. \nABBY And this is another nephew, Jonathan. \nO'HARA Pleased to make your acquaintance.

Come on, come on, let's go into the kitchen. \nO'HARA All right. \nMORTIMER You can tell me all about it.

Another yellow-fever victim ? \nLIEUTENANT ROONEY What ? \nTEDDY All the bodies in the cellar are yellow-fever victims. BROPHY No-no-no, Colonel. This is a spy.

You will take good care of Teddy at Happy Dale ? \nWITHERSPOON Best of care of him, Mister Brewster. \nMORTIMER Oh, that's fine. And no wagon when he leaves. \nWITHERSPOON Why ? To take him away ? Oh, never, never. Taxicabs. We always... I have one waiting now. \nMORTIMER Yes, look, it means a great deal to me. You will personally see that Teddy's happy at Happy Dale ? \nWITHERSPOON He'll be very happy at Happy Dale.

Because I've never been to Happy Dale. \nWITHERSPOON You never can tell. \nMortimer looks surprised by Witherspoon's answer. Then he looks also a bit horrified. \nWITHERSPOON Oh, this is a particularly happy moment for me tonight, Mister... Mister Brewster. Yes, I've never met a dramatic critic and I had been so anxious to. \nMORTIMER Oh, the woods are full of them. \nWITHERSPOON I have here something that will explain what we're trying to do out there at Happy Dale. \nHe gets a booklet out of his pocket. \nMORTIMER Oh ! A pamphlet about Happy Dale ? \nWITHERSPOON Oh, no-no, it's a play. Something I've been working on for some time now. When Mortimer sees Witherspoon flipping the pages of his booklet, a slightly frightened look comes to his face. \nWITHERSPOON It's a dramatization of many of the little incidents that have happened here at Happy Dale. \nMORTIMER Captain !

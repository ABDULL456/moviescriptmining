COLEMAN I'm out, Johnny. 
HOOKER If that's the way you want it. 
COLEMAN That's the way I want it. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. A DIMLY LIT STREET - NIGHT 
It's late at night now.  Hooker and Eirie wander along the street together, not really ready to go home, but with no other ideas either.  Hooker, obviously preoccupied, idly strikes a match on a street lamp as he passes and lets it burn out.  He does this several times. 
HOOKER How do you like that Coleman, huh? After three years. 
EIRIE KID Aw come on, it was the only thing to do.  He knew he was holdin' ya back. 
HOOKER We were partners.  If it weren't for Luther I'd still be hustlin' pinball down at Gianelli's.  I don't need anything more than I got. 
HOOKER You ain't gonna have nothin' if you don't lay off them games of chance. There's a depression on ya know. 
HOOKER There's always a depression on. 
EIRIE KID If you saved a little, you wouldn't have to grift so much. 
HOOKER I like griftin'. 
EIRIE KID You could buy yourself some things. Clothes, or a nice car... 
HOOKER I don't look any good in clothes and I don't know how to drive. What else ya got to sell, Eirie? 
EIRIE KID Forget it. 
They walk on a few more feet, when suddenly a police car pulls up alongside them and two men jump out.  The first, a uniformed policeman, grabs Eirie around the neck. 
Hooker makes a break for it, but the second Figure, a burly detective named Snyder, tackles him in the middle of the street, drags him back into the alley and plasters him up against a brick wall.  The two have met before. 
HOOKER Hi there, Snyder.  Things a little slow down at the Bunco Department tonight, eh?  Somebody lose the dominoes? 
SNYDER You scored blood money today, Hooker.  You need a friend. 
HOOKER (knocking Snyder's hand away) Aw, find yourself a shoplifter to roll. 
Snyder gives Hooker a swift knee in the thigh and follows it with an elbow across the head.  Hooker flies into a row of boxes and garbage cans. 
HOOKER (getting up slowly) You got the wrong guy, pal.  I been home with the flu all day. (rising to a fuller height) You can stake out my toilet if you want. 
Bang.  Snyder, infuriated by Hooker's irreverence, slams him to the ground again.  The policeman is no longer holding Eirie but is almost daring him to make a move.  Eirie wants to go to Hooker's aid, but he knows the policeman will beat him to a pulp. 
SNYDER (pulling Hooker out of the heap and smashing him against the wall again) I'll tell ya what you did, smart boy.  You tied into a loaded mark on 47th across from Maxies.  You and Coleman played the switch for him and blew him off to a cab on 49th.  If he hadn't been a numbers runner for Doyle Lonnegan, it woulda been perfect. 
HOOKER (startled by the information) You're crazy.  I'm not stupid enough to play for rackets money. 
SNYDER Not intentionally maybe, but that don't make no difference to Lonnegan. He'll swat you like any fly. 
HOOKER I'll square it with the fixer. 
SNYDER Nobody can buy you a prayer, if I put the finger on ya. 
Snyder lets go.  Hooker sinks back against the wall.  He says nothing; he's waiting for the price. 
SNYDER I figure your end of the score was at least 3 gees.  I want 2 no matter what it was. 
HOOKER (lying) My end was only one. 
SNYDER (not taking the fake) Then you'll have to come up with another grand somewhere. 
Hooker is beat and he knows it. 
HOOKER All right. 
He reaches into his coat, pulls out a stack of bills and counts out $2000 to Snyder.  Eirie looks on in amazement; he didn't think Hooker had it. 
SNYDER (pocketing the money and motioning his partner to put his gun away) You're a smart egg, Hooker.  No use dyin' for 2 grand. 
Snyder and his policeman friend get in their car and start down the street.  Hooker and Eirie walk nonchalantly in the other direction.

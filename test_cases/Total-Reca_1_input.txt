MELINA What are we doing, Charles? For God's sake, tell us. 
QUAIL The Sphinx... it's not some useless artifact, it's a machine built by some alien race eighteen millions years ago.  The same race that built the on one Earth... for the same purpose. 
He stops in front of a large, odd-shaped vehicle with a large scoop or propeller on the front. 
QUAIL (continuing) This is what we need. 
He begins to climb in;  the others follow. 
BENNIE (referring to the Sphinx) It's a hunk of old stone, man. 
MELINA (ditto) Purpose?  What purpose? 
Bennie starts the engine. 
QUAIL Come on, Bennie, move it. (then, to Melina) Have you heard the word, "terriform"? 
Melina shakes her head.  The vehicle moves off. 
115A    EXT. AIR LOCK - MORNING 
GUARDS are carefully checking every vehicle leaving the city, though this has to be done fairly rapidly because of the inhabitants leaving for the Space Ports. 
The vehicle with Bennie, Quail and Melina arrives. 
115B    INT. VEHICLE - AIR LOCK - MORNING 
Bennie is nervous.  Melina and Quail are in the back, but cannot be seen.  Guards are checking all vehicles exiting, looking for Quail and Melina. 
BENNIE (calling to Guards) Just deliverin' some old junk to the mine out at Apidalia Planitia.  Got them people you're lookin' for in the back as well. 
The Guards laugh and signal him on. 
Once through the second door of the air lock (i.e. to the area outside the city), Quail and Melina emerge and sit up on the rear seats. 
QUAIL The machine in the Sphinx is tapped straight down to the molten core of this planet. There are tunnels and ducts everywhere, all powered by fusion generators... 
BENNIE You sure the little man didn't fry your brain, Quail? 
MELINA (overlapping) For what?  To do what? 
QUAIL To combine elements in the Martian core and release them as oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen. 
BENNIE That's air! 
116B    EXT. DESERT - MORNING 
In a wide shot, the vehicle is traversing the desert.  The domed city is some distance in the background.  Voices are heard in false perspective.  Emphasis is on the dry and hostile natural landscape of Mars. 
QUAIL That's right.  Air and water. Terriforming will create a permanent livable environment for Mars.  No more pressurized cities, no more containers in the desert.  There'll be rivers, vegetation - life - the same as Earth. 
MELINA (baffled) So why is Cohaagen shipping everyone out? 
QUAIL Don't you see?!  From being a pile of red dirt with minerals, Mars is going to change into  a chunk of priceless real estate. 
MELINA And Cohaagen's going to own it all! 
QUAIL Right!  He can start selling it off to well-heeled investors from Earth.  Beach condos, ski resorts, you name it. 
MELINA No wonder he wanted you to... penetrate... out group.

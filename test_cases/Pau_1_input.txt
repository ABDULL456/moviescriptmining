PAUL burst out of the BEHE RESIDENCE, pursued by MOSES who is loading a shotgun. 
PAUL 
GO! GO! GO! The RV start to move forward. The door swings open and GRAHAM appears, beckoning to PAUL. PAUL reaches the door, just as MOSES levels the gun at his target. PAUL leaps into GRAHAM's arms, disappearing inside the RV, as MOSES fires off a booming shot. The BEHE mailbox explodes into pieces, as the RV careens off out of the trailer park. 
INT. RV - DAY 
Blackness. RUTH wakes up. Panic in her eyes. CLIVE drives, GRAHAM sits on the sofa, biting his nails. 
GRAHAM Hi. 
RUTH Where am I? PAUL leans round from the Chewie seat and smile. 
PAUL Hey, look who's up. 
RUTH 
DEMON! 
GRAHAM Would you like a cup of tea? RUTH starts to pray furiously. 
GRAHAM I'm so sorry it had to be this way Ruth. We're definitely not going to hurt you and we'll let you go as son as we can. We were just a little concerned that you might call the police. 
RUTH You have been deceived. Deceived by an agent of Satan himself. 
PAUL (O.S.) You know I'm sitting right here? 
GRAHAM He's not a demon Ruth, he's from another world and we're helping him get home. He's not evil. He's just very rude. 
RUTH How can he be from another world? There is only one world. Our world, created by God the Father. PAUL sits down next to GRAHAM. RUTH whimpers. 
PAUL Look, if it makes you feel any better, my existence only disproves the notion of the Abrahamic, Judeo- Christian God, as well as all single earth theologies. Science still hasn't categorically rule out the notion of divinity, even though evolutionary biology suggest the non-existence of a creator by probability alone. 
RUTH How could that possibly make me feel any better? 
PAUL Jesus Christ, I was just trying to be nice! 
GRAHAM I think what Paul's trying to say is, just because there are other inhabited planets, it's not the end of the world. 
RUTH This isn't happening! You're a hallucination. You're not real. You're a test. A test from God. 
PAUL You can't win can you? RUTH starts to pray furiously, speaking in tongues, making an awful noise. 
CLIVE I can't drive like this. We'll have to drop her off and take our chances. 
GRAHAM No! 
PAUL Oh, for God's sake. PAUL walks over to RUTH and places his and across her forehead. He appear to go into a trance. RUTH's eyes roll up into her head. We see a lightening montage of images. The cosmos, the surface of a planet, others like PAUL, PAUL's ship crashing into the ground. The images speed up as PAUL telepathically send his knowledge into RUTH's mind. They collapse in a heap on the floor. PAUL sparks up a cigarette. 
GRAHAM What did you do to her?! 
PAUL I broadened her horizons. 
GRAHAM Can you broaden mine? 
PAUL No, it's tiring. GRAHAM goes over to where PAUL is lying. 
GRAHAM Oh please. 
PAUL Come here then. PAUL puts his hand on GRAHAM's head. GRAHAM's eyes go all fluttery. We don't see the images this time. GRAHAM falls. 
CLIVE Oh great! Everyone knows the secrets of the universe apart from me. He always knew what was going on in Buffy before me because his mum had cable. 
PAUL Can't I just tell you? 
CLIVE No spoilers! PAUL sighs, then with enormous effort, reaches up and zaps CLIVE who falls to the floor. Everyone lays inert. 
GRAHAM 
(WEAKLY) Maybe I should make that tea? 
EXT. RV PARK - DAY 
THREE BLACK SEDANS are parked in the BEHE RV park. 
MOSES BEHE (O.S.) I didn't call the government. I called the po-lice. 
INT. BEHE RESIDENCE - DAY 
ZOIL Given your description of the intruder, the police felt your call was perhaps better directed to us. 
MOSES BEHE And who are you?

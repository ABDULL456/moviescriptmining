KAREN Oh ! Wait. Wait. Ah ! She says... Well, there were more bags in there before. 
The first policeman seems a bit fed up with Billy. 
ARKADI No, she's right. I will show you. 
CINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR NIGHT 
They are all coming out of the basement on a ramp that reaches the yard and the parking lot around the building. Arkadi is leading them. ARKADI From lift shaft we take the rubbish here. Fast. Easy. 
The janitor says something in Russian. They have reached the large plastic trash containers where all the trashes from the studio are dropped off, waiting for the garbage collectors to take them away. The second policeman raises the lid of a container, while the first policeman looks inside. Arkadi takes a bag out of another container and drops it on the ground. The second policeman looks inside the bag with his flashlight. There seems to be a head inside the bag. The policeman pours the content of the bag on the ground. Actually the head was just a mask ! 
ANDY Hey, we need that. 
He picks up the mask from the rubbish. He wipes it with his hand. The first policeman gives his card to both Billy and Karen. 
FIRST POLICEMAN Sorry, I can do nothing for you now. But I will call you after I see the film. Okay ? Sorry. He walks away. The second policeman shakes hands with Arkadi and Lyosha and goes away with his chief. 
Billy rests her head on Karen's shoulder. 
Lyosha looks at her, shrugs and smiles. 
ANDY'S CAR - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Close up shot on Billy's face, seated in the back of the car. She looks very sad and disappointed. 
Andy is driving, with Karen seated next to him. 
ANDY Well, I've never been more embarrassed in my entire life. 
KAREN I don't get it. I mean, Billy's a pro. She'd know the difference between a real murder and a gag. 
ANDY Please, has she even seen a real murder ? 
KAREN That's my point. If what she saw tonight was real, then she has seen the difference, right ? 
ANDY Oh, come on, honey. We all bought the guy cutting me up tonight. Even I believed it. 
KAREN Because you're a wuss. 
She laughs. ANDY I'm gonna let that slide. 
Karen looks at Billy. 
ANDY No offense, Billy, but I'd like to re-shoot the stuff today using that guy's knife. 
KAREN It was her knife. God ! 
A very short flash-back sequence of the murder of the actress. 
ANDY Whatever. It looked good. 
Another very short flash-back. We understand those short flash- backs come from Billy's mind reliving what she saw a couple of hours before. 
Karen, looking at Billy, seems to understand what's going on inside her sister's head, because she says to Andy : 
KAREN Shut up. 
More short flash-backs of the murder, and a close-up shot on Billy's face. She seems very disturbed. 
CINEMA STUDIO - BASEMENT - INTERIOR NIGHT 
The janitor is patrolling the basement with his dog. He is carrying an electric torch. 
He checks a heavy metal door, which is closed. 
While he is checking the door, the dog runs away. 
The janitor looks around him. 
JANITOR Buka ! 
He is apparently calling his dog, but he gets no answer. He starts looking around.

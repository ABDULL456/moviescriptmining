WILL We have to hunt them down -- and save her! 
Swann's worry has made him short-tempered. 
SWANN Where do you propose we start? If you have any information that concerns my daughter, then share it! If anyone does, tell me! (Will is silent) Leave, Mr. Turner. 
Murtogg has remembered something. He ventures it warily: 
MURTOGG That Jack Sparrow... he talked about the Black Pearl. 
MULLROY Mentioned it, is more what he did. 
MURTOGG Still -- 
WILL We can ask him where it is -- maybe he can lead us to it! 
SWANN 
That pirate tried to kill my daughter. We could never trust a word he said! 
WILL We could strike a bargain - 
NORRINGTON No. The pirates who invaded   this fort left Sparrow locked in   his cell. Ergo, he is not their   ally, and therefore of no value. (through with Will) We will determine their most likely course, and launch a   search mission that sails with the   tide. 
Will slams the boarding axe into the desk, through the map. 
WILL That's not good enough. This is Elizabeth's life! 
Norrington is quick to react; he throws a strong arm across Will's back, and guides him roughly to the door. 
NORRINGTON Mr. Turner, this is not the time for rash actions. (low) Do not make the mistake of thinking you are the only man here who loves Elizabeth. (firm) Now, go home. 
He opens the door, and then turns away. Will watches him walk back to the desk. Will's face sets in resolve, and he leaves. 
INT. FORT CHARLES - JAIL CELLS - MORNING 
Jack strains, trying to budge one of the bars. Even with the damage from the cannon ball, it won't move. He hears the sound of the door latch - 
The door opens, and Will slips in. Looks around. Jack lounges on the floor of his cell, apparently relaxed and unconcerned. Will marches straight up to the bars. 
WILL Are you familiar with that ship? The Black Pearl? 
JACK Somewhat. 
WILL Where does it make berth? 
JACK Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is. 
WILL The ship's real enough. So its anchorage must be a real place. Where is it? 
JACK Why ask me? 
WILL Because you're a pirate. 
JACK And you want to turn pirate yourself? 
WILL Never. (beat) They took Miss Swann. 
JACK (he was right) So it is that you found a girl. Well, if you're intending to brave all and hasten to her rescue and so win fair lady's heart, you'll have to do it alone. I see no profit in it for me. 
Will slams his fist against the bars in frustration. Jack is surprised at the outburst. Will thinks ... makes a decision. 
WILL I can get you out of here. 
JACK How? The key's run off. 
WILL (examines the cell) I helped build these cells. Those are hook-and-ring hinges. The proper application of strength, the door'll lift free. Just calls for the right lever and fulcrum. . . 
Jack watches Will as he speaks, and it dawns on him -- Will is the spitting image of someone he's known in the past. 
JACK Your name is Turner. 
Will gives him a puzzled look. 
WILL Yes. Will Turner. 
Jack grins. 
JACK Will Turner... (he stands) I'll tell you what, Mr. Turner. I've changed my mind. You spring me from this cell, and on pain of death, I'll you to the Black Pearl. (sticks out his hand) Do we have an accord? 
Will gives him a suspicious look. The deal seems too good. Jack keeps his hand out, still smiling. Will shakes it. 
WILL Agreed. 
JACK Agreed! 
Will looks around, figures out   what he needs. He makes a chair his fulcrum, and levers   the long bench under the door. Pushes down -- it's hard   work -- but the cell door rises, and then falls forward,   CRASHING down on the bench and chair. 
Jack is impressed. He steps out of the cell. 
WILL Someone will have heard that. Hurry.

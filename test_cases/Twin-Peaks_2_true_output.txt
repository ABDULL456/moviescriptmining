HAROLD But you're strong Laura...  so much stronger than I...  How can I help you?  I can't.  I can't even go outside. 
Laura reaches up and tenderly touches his cheek. 
HAROLD (continued) What about James?  Can't James help you?  You two are so in love. 
LAURA (flat) He's in love with a girl who's dead. (handing him the diary) It _is_ dangerous for you to have it.  I'm sorry. 
HAROLD (thinking only of her) I'm so sorry, Laura. 
She pulls him to her and kisses him passionately. 
LAURA I don't know when I can come back. Maybe never. 
Laura slowly goes out the door.  Harold can only watch. 
76.     EXT.  HAROLD SMITH'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Laura goes out to the car. 
77.     INT./EXT.  BUICK ROADMASTER - DAY 
Laura starts the car and takes a snort of cocaine. 
Laura pulls out onto the highway.  We stay with her watching her face - struggling with the prospects of the terrifying future. 
78.     INT.  PALMER DINING ROOM - NIGHT 
Laura rushes in to find her mom setting the table.  Sarah stops and stares at Laura. 
SARAH You lied to me about those school books. I found them upstairs on your bed. 
LAURA (suspicion and paranoia) What were you doing in my room? 
SARAH I was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which I found balled up in the bottom of your closet.  Now why did you lie to me?  Where did you go? 
LAURA I had to see Bobby.  I know you really don't like Bobby, but there was a problem and I didn't think you would understand. 
SARAH Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever.  You can tell me anything.  I'll understand. 
LAURA I'm sorry, Mom. 
SARAH Now hurry, dinner's almost ready.  Your father says he's starving.

79.     INT.  PALMER DINING ROOM - NIGHT 
Laura is already at the table.  Sarah puts the rest of the dinner on the table and sits down just as LELAND PALMER enters from the kitchen. He is pretending he is a giant.  Using a voice like a giant. 
LELAND (big giant voice) Hello, Laura.  Hello Sarah.  Where's my axe? (singing) "I'm hungry". 
SARAH Oh, Leland. 
LAURA (embarrassed) Dad. 
LELAND (suddenly speaking Norwegian) Hyggelig a mote dem.  Jeg Heter Leland Palmer. 
Translation is:  How are you?  My name is Leland Palmer. 
Laura and Sarah stare at him. 
LELAND The Norwegians are coming next week and I want you to learn to say what I just learned in Norwegian.  So you can talk to them.  I want you to learn to say, "Hello, my name is Leland Palmer". 
LAURA But my name isn't Leland Palmer. 
SARAH Neither is mine.  And can't we talk about something serious for a change. 
LELAND This is serious.  Mr. Benjamin Horne's got a delegation of Norwegians coming in next week and I want both of you to learn to introduce yourself.  Sarah, you first. 
Leland repeats his phrase for Sarah's benefit. 
LELAND Hyggelig a mote dem.  Jeg Heter Leland Palmer. 
Sarah stumbles through it. 
SARAH Hyggelig a mote dem.  Jeg Heter Sarah Palmer. 
Leland repeats his phrase back to her.  Extends his hand in a friendly handshake. 
LELAND Good.  We'll practice some more.  Laura, now you try it. 
79.     CONTINUED: (2) 
Laughingly, Laura does the same thing. 
LAURA Hyggelig a mote dem.  Jeg Heter Laura Palmer. 
After Laura is done. 
LELAND All together now... 
Leland extends a hand to each of them.  An air of insanity seems to come over the Palmer dining room as they all begin to laugh hysterically and talk in broken Norwegian. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
80.     INT.  LAURA'S ROOM - LATE NIGHT 
The clock reads:  11:30.  Laura's hands open the window and release the screen.  Laura silently sneaks out the window and down the side of her house. 
81.     EXT.  SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY - LATER 
A big semi comes to a stop at a wide spot in the road.  Laura climbs into the truck.

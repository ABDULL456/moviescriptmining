EXT. RAM'S HUNT NIGHT - UPSTAIRS Children leaning down as smoke wafts up. We FOLLOW the smoke DOWN TO Max's cigar. Aloka and Amrita laying the food out. Shambu rubbing his father's aching legs as Hasari and Manooj plant the seeds in Hasari's little tea caddy full of earth from home. Max is watching this "family" huddled around the father. 
RAM Another few months, I'll be able to pay off the moneylender in my village and go home and open a grocery shop. All around me sacks overflowing with all kinds of dal and rice, aromatic spices, piles of vegetables... and at night, I'll lie on my back beneath the trees sniffing fresh aubergines. This beautiful picture burrows into Hasari's mind.   For a moment, he goes there -- home, to the village... RAM If my wife will let me come within a hundred miles of the place where she herself resides. Ram laughs, Hasari smiles... 
HASARI Amrita, I saw a beautiful wedding sari today. Amrita is terribly embarrassed. RAM It was six hundred rupees only. He laughs at the impossibility of the price. MAX That's only 40 dollars, isn't it? HASARI If you have it. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: MAX I'll send it to you from America when I get home tomorrow. HASARI That's very generous but no, thank you. MAX Repayment for punching you in the nose. HASARI You have repaid me by sharing our supper. 
Joan indicates that Max should let it go.    Hasari ever so carefully waters the tea box. RAM Doctor Big Brother, I myself would be willing to accept a gift. Could you give me five rupees in a note -- ten, perhaps. My ankle is badly swelled; the higher the number the more the swelling sinks. Max has to laugh. MAX I don't have a cent on me.   I'll owe you. RAM How much? 
Now everyone's attentions is taken by a CRY from Shambu, who expels his breath, his terrified eyes directing our attention to... 
ANOTHER ANGLE It's an amazing sight. Two lepers: ANOUAR, bearded with a sharp intelligent, unmarked face, makes his way along on a small wheeled board, at an amazingly fast pace, ahead of SAID, a huge, mute leper. They stop some feet away. Lepers aren't often welcome. Out from behind Said steps Poomina. POOMINA Joan Di, my sister! (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: She sees Max, gasps, throws herself behind Said. Joan looks at Max -- he starts to speak, she points a finger that silences him... JOAN It was Poomina who brought you to us. She has herself and her sister to support. It's all right, Poomina. Anouar, what is it? She moves to them.   They're all three badly out of breath. 
WITH JOAN AND LEPERS 
ANOUAR It's Meeta! It's her time. But something is wrong. The midwives don't know what to do! Dr. Sunil, could he help, perhaps? JOAN Dr. Sunil isn't here. POOMINA Meeta will die. 
ANOTHER ANGLE Joan turns to Max, who hasn't heard the exchange. JOAN Max, I wouldn't ask, but it's an emergency. A pregnancy gone awry. It's a leper. Could you have a look? Max is clearly thrown by the sight of the lepers. MAX I don't have any experience with leprosy. JOAN Good Christ, son, because she's a leper doesn't mean she's not built like a woman! HASARI I can run and get Dr. Sunil. JOAN It's too far. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Suddenly, impulsively... ALOKA I could help.    I've had three babies. RAM You can't do that. They're outcasts, they're unclean. There are murmurs of assent from the others. JOAN Oh nonsense!    It's not contagious!

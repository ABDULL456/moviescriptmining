COMMODUS The surgeons say it was his breath that gave out. 
Maximus glances to Lucilla, she avoids his eyes. 
COMMODUS Take my hand, Maximus.  I only offer it once. 
A beat. 
Maximus turns back to Marcus. 
MAXIMUS How will the world speak your name now, old man? 
Without a glance to Commodus, he stalks out. 
A silent beat.  Then Commodus nods to Quintus.  Quintus goes. 
Lucilla looks at Commodus for a long moment, her face an enigmatic tornado of complex emotions. 
Then: 
LUCILLA Hail, Caesar. 
INT.  MAXIMUS' TENT - NIGHT 
Maximus is kneeling before his ancestors, head down, his fists clenched, praying. 
Quintus and four Praetorian ASSASSINS suddenly burst in -- the assassins move immediately to bind Maximus -- swords at his throat -- 
MAXIMUS What -- ?! 
QUINTUS (ashamed) Please don't fight, Maximus -- 
MAXIMUS Quintus -- 
Quintus goes to Maximus' armor, which hangs nearby, and slowly removes his seal of office. 
QUINTUS I'm sorry, General, Caesar has spoken. 
They pull Maximus out -- 
EXT.  MAXIMUS' TENT - TENT CITY - NIGHT 
Five horses are waiting. 
MAXIMUS Quintus, what -- ? 
QUINTUS (anguish) I have no choice -- 
They are almost run over by a stern cohort of twenty Praetorians who gallop past.  Maximus knows immediately what this means. 
MAXIMUS (suddenly) My family?! 
A beat. 
MAXIMUS What about my family, Quintus? 
QUINTUS (quietly) They will greet you in the afterlife. 
Maximus lunges at him -- the Praetorians subdue him -- slamming him with a sword hilt -- knocking him unconscious. 
QUINTUS (quietly, to assassins) Take him as far as the sunrise and then kill him. 
EXT.  FOREST ROAD - DAWN 
The four Praetorian assassins lead Maximus along a road. He sits slumped in his saddle, drained. 
ASSASSIN #1 All right, this is far enough. 
The three other assassins climb from their horses. Assassin #2 pushes Maximus from his horse.  He falls to the ground hard. 
ASSASSIN #1 You two take him down there where no one will find him. 
ASSASSIN #3 Come on, General... 
Assassin #3 and Assassin #4 drag Maximus down a densely forested hill along the road.  Maximus' hands are still bound in front of him.  He seems totally lacking in any resistance. 
EXT.  FOREST - BELOW THE ROAD - DAWN 
Maximus eyes the two assassins as they troop down the hill away from the road, he notes their sparkling armor. The armor of men who have never seen real battle. 
MAXIMUS Have you ever done this before? 
ASSASSIN #3 What? 
MAXIMUS Killed a man with a sword?

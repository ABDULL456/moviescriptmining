A beat as she holds there, when Murphy's hand grabs it. 
MURPHY I'll take that. 
A beat as she looks to Murphy. 
EPPS It was you. 
He only looks back at her as she stands there. 
EPPS You killed them. 
MURPHY It was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody. (a beat) You saw it coming as well as I did. Dodge had his plans, starting with scuttling the boat. And Greer too, except he went nuts. Couldn't take it, I guess. Could've happened in the middle of downtown Anchorage. But did it make him any less dangerous? I don't think so. 
EPPS So you killed them? 
MURPHY The way I figure it, it was them or me. I thought putting Dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a little time. Made it look like whoever killed those Greeks was still around. But it's just us on this ship. Us and your... spirit friends. 
EPPS And now you're gonna kill me, is that it? 
MURPHY I didn't want it to turn out this way. 
EPPS Murphy, don't you see what's happening? 
MURPHY I think I see it pretty well. 
EPPS It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way. 
MURPHY I know a little bit about human nature and what I've seen only confirms that. 
EPPS It's a trap. There was no way we were gonna get away with that gold. Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. This ship sucks people in and it never lets them out. 
MURPHY I think maybe you been on this boat a little too long, with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo. There's nothing supernatural about greed. And that's what it comes down to, pure and simple. 
EPPS I don't give a damn about the gold. 
MURPHY I wish I could believe that. Either way, you know what I've done. I've got no choice. 
He raises the shotgun. 
MURPHY I'm sorry. 
He prepares to fire, when a CONCUSSION ROCKS THE SHIP. Epps ducks and Murphy fires, a spatter of buckshot shredding the vent behind her. A SCREECHING OF METAL DEEP IN THE SHIP SOUNDS as she gets up, diving for cover as Murphy shuttles the gun again. 
WITH EPPS 
Epps scrambles behind a deck vent. 
EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
The ship has bounced off yet another small island, the jagged rocks loudly scrapping the hull with a deafening shriek. 
EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
Murphy crosses toward the deck vent. 
MURPHY There's no reason to make this any more difficult than it has to be. 
WITH EPPS 
As Epps holds there she sees the vent opening. She pulls herself up and climbs inside. 
INT. CHIMERA - AIR SHAFT - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
Epps climbs down the air shaft where a giant fan spans its width. She squeezes through the fan blades and drops down where several vent ducts lead in different directions below it. 
EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
Murphy comes to the vent duct where Epps went down. 
INT. CHIMERA - AIR DUCT - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
Epps crawls through. She comes to a vent that leads out to a passageway. 
INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
Murphy runs quickly down the stairway, shotgun at the ready. 
INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
The vent is shoved out and falls to the metal catwalk. 
INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
The CLANG FROM THE VENT SOUNDS HERE and Murphy stops. 
INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
Epps extends her feet and climbs down into the passage.

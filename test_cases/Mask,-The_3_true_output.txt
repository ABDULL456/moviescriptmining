DORIAN Where's Chun Woo? 
FREEZE Takin' a dirt nap. It was bad, man. Real bad. (swallows hard) I need a smoke. 
DORIAN Yeah... sure. 
Dorian taps out a cigarette, places it between Dr. Freeze's lips and lights it... but the flame doesn't draw. 
Beat. 
The cigarette tumbles from Freeze's mouth. 
Dorian glances back up and sees that Dr. Freeze's eyes are glazed over in death. 
Dorian leaps to his feat and hurls his chair across the room in anger. It SMASHES the mirror over his bar. 
DORIAN (CONT.) Son of a bitch! Who did this Eddy? Who? 
Eddy is staring at Dorian's T.V. monitor. On it the Mask can still be seen in the midst of his wild dance with Tina. 
EDDY That's him... That's the guy! 
Dorian grabs a .45 from his desk, checks the barrel and jams it in his coat. 
DORIAN Come on! 
CUT TO: 
INT. DANCE FLOOR 
The Mask spins Tina all around him like a top and then SHOOTS her straight up into the air. 
Amazingly, she continues somersaulting at the apex of her ascent, suspended in mid-air by her magical momentum. 
THE MASK 
stands there nonchalantly filing his nails, whistling to himself. 
Tina continues to SPIN in place high above him. 
THE MASK 
casually checks his watch. Without looking up he holds out one hand for the catch. 
TINA 
perfect timing... A final somesault and she drops right back down into his arms. They go straight back into a rockin' hitterbug without missing a beat. 
THE WINDING STAIRCASE 
Dorian and Eddy race down the steps, guns drawn. Dorian calls to Bobby by the hostess' stand. 
DORIAN Clear the club. Now! 
DANCE FLOOR 
The dance's grand finale. The Mask spins Tina around and around his body like a baton in one of those awful Hawaiian fire dances. 
As the band bangs out the final bars of the tune, the Mask SCREECHES Tina to a halt, bends her over backwards and nails her with a Valentino kiss that literally blows her shoes off; SSSMACK! KAPOW! 
She hangs onto the Mask's tie for support when BANG the tie is shot in half. Tina falls on her cute behind. 
C.U. - TIE 
The shot-away piece of the Mask's tie flutters to the floor and MORPHS back into a piece of Stanley's pajamas. 
DORIAN 
stands at the edge of the dance floor, his smoking gun trained on the Mask. 
THE MASK (gasps in mock horror) Gee willickers! Does this mean we won't make the Star Search finals? 
DORIAN This means you won't make it out of this club alive if you don't tell me where my money is. 
THE MASK Okay... 
The Mask immediately whips out an old fashioned pull handle calculator, snaps on a green visor and starts tabulating. KA- CHING. 
THE MASK (CONT.) (fast talking) You got a 27.5% in T-Bills amortized over the fiscal yeah 16-3/4% in stocks and bonds/ (KA-CHING, KA-CHING) Carry the nine and divide by the Gross National Product... 
DORIAN Now cut that out! (turns to Eddy) Ventilate this goon! 
Eddy pulls out his .38 and starts blasting BLAM. BLAM. 
The Mask dodges the bullets by contorting his cartoon-flexible body. 
BLAM. The Mask SPINS once and freezes in a pirouette, now dressed in a tutu. 
BLAM. The Mask SPINS again and stops dressed as a matador, the bullet whizzes under his cape. 
BLAM BLAM BLAM

FADE IN 
1   EXT. EASTERN SEABOARD - AERIALS - DAY                           1 
High in the air----so high we an see the curvature of the earth. The eastern seaboard stretches away, flecked with clouds. 
As we dissolve in closer the picture bleaches of color.   We are looking down at the city of Washington, D.C. 
Dissolve closer still: a black-and-white aerial photograph of a neighborhood in suburban D.C. dominated by a sprawling building. Computer type quickly bleeps on: 
C.I.A. Headquarters Langley, Virginia 
2   INT. CIA - HALLWAY - DAY                                        2 
We track at floor level, following the well shined shoes of someone walking down the well polished hallway. 
3   INT. PALMER'S OFFICE - DAY                                      3 
We hear a door opening and a silver-haired man rises behind his desk. A nameplate on the desk identifies him as Palmer DeBakey Smith. 
PALMER Ozzie.    Sit down. 
Osbourne Cox, entering, is a middle-aged man in a striped shirt and bow tie. 
OSBOURNE Palmer.   What's up. 
PALMER You know Peck, and Olson. 
The two men, sitting on chairs facing the desk, nod at Osbourne, who is surprised to see them. 
OSBOURNE Peck, yes, hiya. Olson, by reputation. Hi, Osbourne Cox. 
OLSON Yeah, hiyah. 
OSBOURNE Aren't you with...aren't you, uh... 
Palmer jumps in: 
PALMER Yeah, that's right. Oz, look. There's no easy way to say this. We're taking you off the Balkans desk. 
OSBOURNE You're----what? Why? 
PALMER In fact we're moving you out of Sigint entirely. 
OSBOURNE ...What?    No discussion, just----you're out? 
PALMER Well, we're having the discussion now Oz. This doesn't have to be unpleasant. 
OSBOURNE Palmer, with all due respect----what the fuck are you talking about? 
A beat. 
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) ... And why is Olson here? 
Another uncomfortable beat. 
PALMER ... Look, Ozzie---- 
OSBOURNE What the fuck is this?!     Is it my----I know it's not my work. 
PALMER Ozzie---- 
OSBOURNE I'm a great fucking analyst!     Is it---- 
PALMER Oz, things are not going well.      As you know. 
PECK You have a drinking problem. 
Stunned silence.         Ozzie turns to look at Peck. 
At length: 
OSBOURNE I have a drinking problem. 
PALMER This doesn't have to be unpleasant. We found you something in State. It's a, uh... 
He gropes, uncomfortable. 
PALMER (CONT'D) ... It's a lower clearance level. Yes. But we're not, this isn't, we're not terminating you. 
OSBOURNE (quietly) This is an assault. 
PECK Come on, Ozzie. 
OSBOURNE This is an assault. I have a drinking problem? Fuck you, Peck, you're a Mormon! 
PECK Ozzie---- 
OSBOURNE Next to you we all have a drinking problem! Fuck you guys! Whose ass didn't I kiss? Let's be honest! 
Palmer nods at Olson.

FLASHBACK to the motorcycle... 
BACK TO 1967.  Jim and Lou walk with Dodd and Holland near the picket fence.  We feel the emptiness of the area now and see the normal amount of traffic driving by. 
HOLLAND ...we came around here to look for tracks.  It rained that morning and we found a bunch of cigarette butts. Someone'd been standing about here... 
The camera shows the "spot" and Lou sighting. 
LOU This is a good spot, chief, for the head shot. 
Jim looks, reliving the moment. 
Later Jim and Lou stand on the south side of Elm Street in Dealey Plaza talking to Jean Hill, an attractive, 30-ish teacher.  Her demeanor has a rock-solid Texas back-country conviction to it; she's a woman not easily frightened. 
JEAN HILL I was standing here next to my friend Mary Mooman, who took the photograph when he was killed... 
We see a flash of the Moorman photograph - a blurry Polaroid with the President in the foreground and the picket fence in background.  We will return to this photograph in more detail later. 
JEAN HILL I jumped out in the street and yelled, "Hey Mr. President, look over here, we wanna take your picture."  He looked up and then shots rang out. Mary fell to the ground right away, shouting, "Get down, they're shooting, get down, they're shooting." I knew it but I was moving to get closer to him.  The driver had stopped - I don't know what was wrong with that driver.  And then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw this flash of light, in the bushes and that last shot... just ripped his head off, I mean, blood, brains, just blew everything... 
FLASHBACK TO the day of the shooting.  We hear the sound of shots and see the Grassy Knoll from Jean's point of view. 
JEAN HILL I looked up and saw smoke from the Knoll.  And everything was frozen - seemed like people wasn't even breathing, like you're looking at a picture - except this one guy.  I saw this one guy running from the Book Depository towards the railroad tracks.  And that was the same man I saw on TV two days later shooting Oswald.  That was Jack Ruby.  No question about it. 
Blurry image - we're not at all sure what or who or if... but a seed is planted.  We see smoke - the same smoke Bowers saw... then Jack Ruby in a brown coat running from the Book Depository toward the railroad tracks.  Then we see Jean's view as she runs toward the Knoll along with others.  there are yells, shouts, and general confusion. 
JEAN HILL It was him I was chasing up the Grassy Knoll, thinking our guys had shot back and maybe we got one of them. I don't know what I would have done if I had caught him, but I knew something terrible had happened and somebody had to do something. 
At the picket fence, we see blurry images of police officers, railroad workers, cigarette butts, buddy footprints, confusion... 
*JEAN HILL I never did catch him.  All I saw in that parking area were railroad workers and Dallas' finest. 
Two Secret Service types approach her suddenly, and one of them puts an arm on her shoulder. 
FIRST AGENT Secret Service, ma'am.  You're coming with us. 
JEAN HILL Oh no, I'm not.  I don't know you. We gotta catch this shooter - don't you realize? 
SECOND AGENT (grabbing her other shoulder) I said you're coming with us.  I want the pictures in your pocket. 
JEAN HILL (V.O.) ...he put a hurt on me but good. 
JEAN HILL I don't have any pictures!  I have to go back and find my friend Mary. Lemme alone! 
The two agents hustle her away. 
FIRST AGENT Hush!  Just smile and keep walking. 
Hill, 32 years old that day, is shown into a third floor office of the County Courts Building - which has a view of the assassination area.  Other Secret Service agents are there.  Some 18 people are detained there. 
TIME CUT TO two men interrogating Hill. 
JEAN HILL (V.O.) These new people never identified themselves.  They musta been watching the whole thing 'cause they knew everything Mary and me had been doing that day.  I guess I wasn't too hard to find - wearing that red raincoat. 
MAN How many shots you say you heard? 
JEAN HILL Four to six. 
MAN That's impossible.  You heard echoes ...echoes.  We have three bullets and three shots which came from the Book Depository and that's all we're willing to say. 
JEAN HILL (V.O.) ...which is strange 'cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination. 
JEAN HILL No, I saw a guy shooting from over there.  He was behind that fence. What are you going to do about it? 
MAN We have that taken care of.  You only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this. No one, you hear? 
JEAN HILL (V.O.) I was scared.  It was all kinda queer, but it sure felt like two and two was coming up three... and then they took Mary's five snapshots from me, sent them to Washington, and when they returned them weeks later, two of them had the backgrounds mutilated... The only one we saved was in Mary's camera.  I didn't want to go to Washington when the Warren Commission subpoenaed me... so the lawyer come down here and interviewed me at Parkland Hospital. 
In a Parkland Hospital office in 1964, a lawyer interviews Jean Hill.  A female stenographer takes notes. 
JEAN HILL He asked me why I thought I was in danger and I said: 
JEAN HILL Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me. 
LAWYER That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill. We have the man that killed the President. 
JEAN HILL No, you don't! 
JEAN HILL He kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots.  He was getting hot under the collar, and telling the woman not to write when he wanted. 
JEAN HILL Look, do you want the truth, or just what you want me to say? 
LAWYER I want the truth. 
JEAN HILL The truth is that I heard between four and six shots.  I'm not going to lie for you. 
LAWYER ...you heard echoes. 
JEAN HILL No.  I had guns all my life.  I used to go turtle shooting. 
LAWYER I realize you're under a great deal of stress .. it's clouded your judgement. 
JEAN HILL (V.O.) So off the record, he starts talking about my family, and even mentioned my marriage was in trouble like I didn't know it or something.  He got angrier and angrier and then: 
LAWYER Look, we can put you in a mental institution.  We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is. 
JEAN HILL (V.O.) I knew something was crooked as a dog's hind leg, 'cause no one who is just taking a deposition gets that involved and angry... sure enough, when I finally read my testimony as published by the Warren Commission, it was a fabrication from start to finish.

Official White                                                                                     62. 
ZED No! I told you, that's not where we're going. 
ISAAC Fine. Then we'll just stand here. 
ZED Fine. They stand there for less than a beat. ZED                                                             (cont'd) Okay, you win. Take us to Sodom. Isaac takes a couple of steps to the top of a rise and points off in the distance. 
THEIR POV Shining in the moonlight, the magnificent city of Sodom set atop a broad hill surrounded by high walls. 
ZED I knew it was right around here. 
ISAAC Me and my friends sneak in on the weekends. We hang around, pick up on the babes, drink some wine, get wasted on killer hash-- 
ZED You shouldn't be smoking either. 
ISAAC Thanks, Grandpa, but I've been smoking for four harvests, so I think I'm okay. They start down toward the city.

Zed, Oh and Isaac gape at the high masonry walls as they approach the massive solid wooden gates. 
Official White                                                             63. 
OH Gee, they're not open. We should probably come back later. 
ISAAC You just have to knock. They always let me in. (to Oh) Go ahead. 
OH Me? Why do I have to knock? What if we're waking somebody up? Let's just get out of here. 
ZED Where? Back to the penis-cutter? Besides, Eema and Maya might be in there. You want to get them out before the city's destroyed, don't you? Isaac impatiently grabs a big rock and starts banging on the door. 
ISAAC 
(SHOUTING) Hey! Anybody there? Hello? Suddenly Zed and Oh are yanked off their feet from behind and slammed into the wall by helmeted sentries. Isaac quickly runs away. 
SENTRY (shouts at him) Halt! Isaac stops a safe distance away and turns back to taunt the guards. 
ISAAC You gonna make me? (dancing and dodging like a boxer) You and what army? 
ZED (shouts to Isaac) Get help! Tell your father! 
ISAAC (shouts back) Yeah!

Official White                           64. ISAAC                                                           (cont'd) Like I'm really gonna tell my father I came with you to Sodom. So long, suckers! He takes off running. 
ZED (to Oh) I kinda get why his dad wanted to kill him. The sentries drag them through a small door cut into a corner of the city gates. 
CUT TO:

The sentries shove them into a small guard post and throw them up against the wall. THREE OTHER GUARDS look up at the new arrivals. 
FIRST GUARD What's this now? 
SENTRY They were banging on the gate. Hebrews, from the look of them. 
ZED We're not really Hebrews-- The guard smacks him in the mouth. ZED                                                             (cont'd) Okay. Lesson learned. No talking. 
SENTRY Should we wake the Sergeant? 
FIRST GUARD You don't want to do that. He gets pretty mean when you wake him. 
OH Meaner than this? The sentry grabs Oh's nipple and twists. Oh SCREAMS loudly. The guards freeze at the sound of his scream and look nervously to a closed door at one end of the room.

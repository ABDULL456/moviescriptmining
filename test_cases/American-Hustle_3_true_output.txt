Irving gets up to walk out as Richie and Edith stand in the doorway. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) Crazy thing about people -- the more you say no, the more they want in on somethin. It is so stupid. 
Irving looks over at Richie and Edith. 
IRVING ROSENFELD I'll tell them, don't worry. Hey you know what Carl just told me? He said he could do this whole thing with four guys within a week. 
CARL ELWAY Or we could do somethin' much bigger! 
Richie jumps into the conversation. 
RICHIE DIMASO Something bigger? My guy deals with hundreds of millions of dollars. How much bigger? 
He walks over to Carl. 
CARL ELWAY Hundreds of million -- I knew you were holdin' out on me Irving! Hundreds of millions of dollars? Like much bigger. Like I'm talking about we say never the fuck mind the CD's and we could have some complete access to something huge. 
RICHIE DIMASO Huge? Like what? (introducing himself) Robert Spencer, advisor to the Sheik. 
CARL ELWAY Carl Elway. 
Irv stares at Richie with contempt, then turns to Edith, DRESSED TO THE NINES. 
CARL ELWAY (CONT'D) I want you to think of the most undervalued asset in the state of New Jersey today. The rebuilding of Atlantic City. 
Richie looks over at Irving and Sydney and mouths the word "WOW". 
CARL ELWAY (CONT'D) Look, maybe they, maybe they legalized gambling a year ago but nothing's happening. 
Irving interjects. 
IRVING ROSENFELD Hey, quit while you're ahead Carl. 
CARL ELWAY I know the guy. I know the right people who are going to help you out. 
RICHIE DIMASO Whose the guy? 
CARL ELWAY The guy is Carmine Polito. 
RICHIE DIMASO Whose Carmine Polito? 
75   INT. FBI OFFICE, FEDERAL OFFICE BUILDING, NY                   75 
PUSH IN: STODDARD THORSEN, Richie's FBI supervisor. 
STODDARD THORSEN (shakes his finger `no') Carmine Polito? Carmine Polito, no. 
We freeze frame on Stoddard as we HEAR Richie'S VO: 
AS Richie TALKS WE SEE A SHORT FILM ABOUT Carmine Polito: 
- PUSH IN: Mayor Polito walks a Camden street waves, shakes hands of WELL-WISHERS 
RICHIE DIMASO (V.O.) My boss Stoddard proceeded to tell me that Carmine Polito was the most quietly powerful person in the state of New Jersey. A lifetime native of the very racially mixed Camden, which had become a ghetto, and where he had been Mayor for ten years. A very beloved guy. A guy who never gave up on his people. His father had emigrated from Italy and had stoked coal. 
- Frank Sinatras COFFEE SONG, 1940s version, as we see Carmine talk to and dance joyfully with his kids and wife at breakfast. 
RICHIE DIMASO (V.O.) A big family guy with five kids. They even adopted some other kid. A black kid from the Boys and Girls Club who'd lost his family. I mean, his household was a joyous place. And his wife Dolly, she was the apple of his eye and the center of the household. I mean everyone loved this guy. 
- PULL OUT Mayor Polito walks up steps of City Hall as he greets a women and her baby; into his office greeted by a couple of AIDES who show him papers to sign. 
RICHIE DIMASO (V.O.) And he had a huge heart. 
78   INT. CAMDEN CITY HALL - W.P.A. MURAL ROOM - DAY                78 
CARMINE POLITO (giving speech) The W.P.A. employed craftsmen to paint this during the Depression. Why can't we employ people today to do work like this in rebuilding Atlantic City? 
RICHIE DIMASO (V.O.) He worked with all the unions. He was the leader of the State Assembly. And he had just gotten gambling legalized in New Jersey to create jobs. 
80   -- FLOOR OF STATE ASSEMBLY -- Carmine huddles with other       80 STATE LEGISLATORS, horsetrading and then poses for a picture with other members of the State Assembly. 
RICHIE DIMASO (V.O.) But he couldn't get the funds to rebuild Atlantic City and that was his problem. So with our help, he was about to have his hand in the wrong pocket at the wrong time. And to me that meant corrupt 
81                                                     BACK TO:     81 
STODDARD THORSEN You said grifters and con artists. We're not going after some politician. This is a bad idea, Richard. 
RICHIE DIMASO Shhhh. Look, it's really simple. All you need is to put two million in a Chase account -- 
STODDARD THORSEN What?! 
RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D) -- under the Sheik's name -- 
STODDARD THORSEN Whose two million?! 
RICHIE DIMASO Shh, just listen. Two million dollars under the Sheik's name, in a Chase account that we control. Carmine calls up on the telephone -- calls the bank -- and he sees that the Sheik is real and he has a real account. Five days. 
STODDARD THORSEN I'm not taking two million dollars of the taxpayers' money and putting it anywhere for five days, I don't care if we control it the whole time. 
Richie as he stares at Stoddard in frustration. 
RICHIE DIMASO Stoddard, let us do what we need to do to rule out corruption and to get rid of the payoff guys that are ruining this country. That's my dream. Don't smother it, please. 
STODDARD THORSEN You know Richard, I understand your eagerness. I really do. You know I'm from Michigan, right? Let me tell you a story about me, and my dad, and my brother. We used to go ice fishing every November. Ice Fishing. That's what we lived for. 
RICHIE DIMASO Holy shit -- 
STODDARD THORSEN Just listen to me. It's beautiful. You have a little stove. You huddle around, you keep each other warm. You drop a line and you just wait. One year my brother says, "let's go in October." He wants to go ice fishing in October. My dad says, "No, the ice is too thin." My brother says -- I love my brother he says --

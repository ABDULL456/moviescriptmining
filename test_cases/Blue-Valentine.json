I want another child. \nCindy bites her lip. He slides his hand between her legs. \nCINDY No... Dean... Wait a second. \nShe removes his hand and places it on her hip. Dean continues to kiss her neck. He slides his hand up to her breasts. Cindy turns her head in the other direction. She pushes his hand away. He brings it back aggressive. Again. Cindy squirms underneath him. He grabs her wrists and holds her arms over her head. His tongue licks Cindy from her breasts to her face. She worms her arms away and grabs onto his hair. She arches her back, looks at him through slit eyes. His pelvis pulses and he moans. He looks up at her over his brow into her desperate eyes. He springs up. Sweat beads on his forehead. \nDEAN What!? I can't have sex with my wife!? \nCindy covers her face with her hand. \nDEAN (CONT'D) Do I repulse you that much? I'm good to you. I'm good to Frankie.

Would that make it easier on you so you can treat me like this? \nCindy raises her hips and slips off her panties. She lifts the shirt up over her head, positions her feet on the door jam.

He lowers onto her. Cindy adjusts her legs higher. He rotates his hips, looks away in concentration. Cindy's arms move around him, grabbing the small of his arching back. His pelvis humps in a feeble performance. A small moan. Cindy's eyes press closed harder. The erratic motion slows... stops. Dean's raspy breathing. His weight covers Cindy. She opens her eyes to the ceiling. \nDEAN (CONT'D) I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry... \nShe looks at him. His head faces away. She rolls out from underneath and stands. She wraps her dress around her and slips into the bedroom. \nINT. ROMANTASUITES - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS \nBack against the closed door, Cindy turns the lock. Her eyes shift from despair to relief. Her gaze grows more wild. The doorknob jiggles. A secret, crazy laugh builds in Cindy that she suppresses. Dean presses his face into the bedroom door. He talks to her. \nOn the other side of the door, Cindy listens. Dean's voice cracks. A wave of confusion backs Cindy away from the door. She searches the room for an escape. There are no windows, the only way out is through the locked door. Trembling, she wraps her arms around herself. She tries to make herself as small as possible. The spaceship bed is the only place where she can disappear. She crawls underneath the covers, curls into a tight ball. Sadness lets loose. Cindy's body pulses with faint, painful tears. The black walls of the room twinkle with stars suspended in space. The cries get lost. \nEXT. CITY. NIGHT. 6 YEARS EARLIER. \nDrunk, Dean and Cindy make out on the street corner. It is cold enough to see their breath. Their hands caress each other, feel what is underneath the layers of clothes. Cindy makes a move.

They crawl under with clothes on. \nCINDY (WHISPERS) Is your roommate awake? \nDEAN (WHISPERS) I don't know. Let me go check. \nDean tiptoes over to Jake's room. Peeks in his door. Returns to the couch where Cindy is taking off her jacket. He crawls back under the sheet. \nDEAN What do you want to do? \nCINDY I don't know. \nDEAN (after a pause) We'll keep it. We'll take care of it. \nCindy nods. Silence. \nCINDY It's not the right time. \nDean looks down, pauses and looks back to Cindy. \nDEAN Do you want to take care of it? \nINT.

This is going to be a little cold. \nThe Doctor inserts a speculum into Cindy's vagina. \nDOCTOR (CONT'D) There, take a deep breath... What do you do? \nCINDY I'm a student... \nDOCTOR What are you studying? \nThe Doctor dips a long swab into a solution, inserts it into her vagina. \nCINDY I'm studying to be a DOCTOR... \nDOCTOR That's what I studied. \n(CONTINUED) Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 62. 102 CONTINUED: (2) 102 \nShe laughs.

You're going to feel a pinch and then it's going to feel like electricity. \nCindy looks back up at the ceiling. She steady's her breath. \nDOCTOR (CONT'D) Can you cough for me. \nCindy coughs. \nDOCTOR (CONT'D) Good... Why do you want to be a Doctor? \nWheels move across the linoleum floor.

Cindy's bags sit next to a made bed. He calls out for her again. - He walks into the bathroom and urinates, finds only a damp towel hanging over the shower door. He touches the bristles of Cindy's toothbrush, flicking up a spray of water. - He walks to the kitchen and lights a cigarette. He coughs a little as he pours himself a cup of coffee. Zaps it in the microwave. \nEXT. ROMANTASUITES - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS - PRESENT DAY 108 \nA plane cuts through the sky. Dean stands in front of an empty parking space.

Pacing, he lets out a few angry weeps and reaches in his front shirt pocket for a cigarette. He's out. In the ashtray, he grabs a snuffed out butt. He searches for a lighter. He lights his cigarette on the stove. He hears the kids in the hallway. \nHe opens the door and Randy, a hungover high school kid, and AMANDA, large-chested, short, walk down the hallway, arm and arm. They slow when see a frighteningly dishevelled Dean, vodka in hand, cigarette in mouth, framed in the door jam. \nINT.

All the furniture, pictures, gone - just an empty bed. Dean is at a loss for what to do. He hears the TV coming from across the hall. He knocks, waits, then opens Cindy's Gramma's door. She is lying in bed. Tries to recognize Dean. He pulls up a chair next to her. \nDEAN Hi. I was looking for your neighbor... the man who moved in last month. Across the hall. Do you know what happened to him? \n(CONTINUED) Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 41. 86 CONTINUED: 86 \nGRAMMA He went out for groceries. \nDEAN What about the girl that was with you? \nGRAMMA Who? \nThe conversation moves in circles.

Finds the locket. He puts it on. The bus comes to a stop. A few passengers get on. One of them is Cindy. Dean watches her pay her fare and move to the back of the bus without noticing him. \nShe finds a seat, pulls her hoodie low, anonymous. She underlines passages from a textbook using a highlighter. Dean is frozen. He gathers the courage to walk toward her. The moving bus throws his balance. He stands over her for a moment. Cindy senses somebody in her space. She looks up. Recognizes him, but can't place it. \nDEAN Hi. \nCINDY Hi. \nDEAN I just had a long talk with your gramma... is that, is that your gramma? \nCindy remembers him now - he's just dressed nicer - he doesn't look like a mover \nDEAN (CONT'D) I was looking for that old guy who moved across the hall, you know?

I hate these things. \nCINDY Push me. \nDean is tentative, but goes along with her. He starts slow, but she eggs him to go faster. He runs in circles picking up speed until he is in a breathless, circular sprint. He can't keep up with the centrifugal force. \nCINDY (CONT'D) Get on! \nDean does as he's told. They both hold on for dear life. The world spins in a frenzy. The dread on Dean's face builds to insane laughter. It is super fun. Cindy screams. Her hair snaps in her face. Then, a look of sickness steals her smile away. She wants it to stop, which, slowly, it does. She gets off first, tries to walk, but is too dizzy. She just keeps falling to the ground. Dean crawls off the merry-go round on all fours, laughing. \n(CONTINUED) Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 47. 91 CONTINUED: (2) 91 \nDEAN What happened, tough guy? \nCINDY Make it stop. \nDEAN You gotta puke... it's the only way. \nShe refuses. \nDEAN (CONT'D) It's the only way. It will make you feel better. Don't be embarrassed. I'll do it. \nHe sticks his finger down his throat and forces himself to vomit. The sound of it is too much for her. She gags. Side by side, they puke into the gravel. They finish their business and end up on their backs and out of breath, side by side, looking up at the stars. They are both covered in sweat. We see their breath. \nCINDY I'm still spinning. \nDEAN Me too. \nCINDY Maybe it's just the Earth that's spinning. \nDEAN Yeah. We're flying. \nThey laugh. Birds begin to awaken and fly. \nDEAN (CONT'D) You should come visit me in the city sometime. \nThe morning air chills their bodies. Dean takes off his jacket and uses it as a blanket. They get close together to get warm and watch the stars spin above them. \nINT. ROMANTASUITES - MOON ROOM - NIGHT - PRESENT DAY \nThe dining room table is set for two.

Cindy stares through Dean. \nCINDY Why don't you do something... \nDEAN Like what? \nCINDY I don't know... isn't there anything you want to do? \nDean thinks about it. Shakes his head. \nDEAN What am I supposed to want to do? \nCINDY I don't know... You have so many things you could do. You're good at everything. You could do anything you wanted. \nDEAN I just wanna be with you. \nSilence. Cindy tries not to look disappointed. \nDEAN (CONT'D) You look like an animal right now. Your eyes look like an animal.

We don't have to get in each other's way. \nDEAN And that's the way you like it, don't you? You don't like me to bother you. \nCINDY I didn't say that.

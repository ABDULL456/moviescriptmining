WHIP (KEYS MIC) 260...we'll do our best. (TO EVANS) It's getting away from me! I can't hold...dump the flaps! 
EVANS We're still fast. 
The yoke is ripping away from Whip's hands. 
WHIP DO IT! 30 percent! 
Evans dumps in the flaps. The JR-88 slows dramatically and balloons up. 
WHIP (CONT'D) That bought us a little time. We need to revert to manual control. Your side first, pul... 
Whip is interrupted by the radio. 
ATC (ON RADIO) SouthJet 227, Atlanta. Fuel dump is approved. 
WHIP (KEYS MIC) Thank you. 
Evans is confused and panicked, he throws his hands up. 
WHIP (CONT'D) Evans, look at me! Manual Reversion. Red lever, on the floor, far side of the console. 
Evans sees it. 
EVANS I got it. 
WHIP Pull it up, turn it clockwise, push it back down. 
Evans does exactly that, then pulls back on his yoke -- nothing! 
EVANS Nothing! No control! 
WHIP Goddamn it!! 
Once again, the plane pitches into a dive. Whip strains to hold on. 
WHIP (CONT'D) I can't let go! Can you reach mine? 
Evans strains to reach Whip's Reversion Pull-Handle -- but can't. 
EVANS I can't reach it. 
Evans moves to release his harness, but Whip stops him. 
WHIP No! Don't! Stay strapped in! (calls over his shoulder) Margaret! Margaret! 
Margaret tumbles into the cockpit, catching herself on Whip's chair. She's crying. 
MARGARET Oh God, Whip. What's happening?! 
WHIP Get strapped into the jump-seat. I need your help. 
Margaret opens the jump-seat and starts to pull on her harness. Throughout the scene she is struggling with her harness. 
WHIP (CONT'D) Margaret, see that red lever on the floor next to my chair? The one that says, Manual Control? 
MARGARET Yes. 
WHIP On the count of three you pull it up, turn it clockwise, then push it back down. OK? You ready? 
With tears streaming down her cheeks, she gives Whip a brave nod. 
WHIP (CONT'D) Here we go. One, two... 
Whip releases back pressure from his yoke, pushing it forward -- the plane noses downward 20 degrees! 
WHIP (CONT'D) ...three! 
MORE TERRIFIED SHRIEKS come from the back. Margaret quickly disengages then re-engages the large red handle. 
Whip pulls back on his yoke. The plane pitches up. 
WHIP (CONT'D) Ok. OK. We got something. It's still stiff as hell. Evans, put in some power! 
Evans pushes up the throttles. Whip gingerly applies pressure to his stick. His face fills with worry. 
WHIP (CONT'D) I don't know. It feels like the son of a bitch wants to nose over. 
Then suddenly... WHAP! Whip's yoke flies out of his hands and SLAMS forward! 
The plane banks right and drops! Margaret SCREAMS! 
WHIP (CONT'D) SHIT! POWER BACK! (he pulls back the power) I CAN'T FUCKING BELIEVE THIS! 
EVANS OH NO! 
Now, ATC comes on the radio... 
ATC SouthJet 227, Hartsfield-Jackson is eleven o'clock and niner miles. I see you below 10,000. How are you doing? 
WHIP (keys his mic) Not good. You got anything closer? We're in a rapid dive here... 
ATC Roger, SouthJet 227. Uh...Clayton County is 2 miles at your 4 o'clock. 
WHIP Negative. We're too high...we can't pitch for glide. We have no stabilizer control. 
ATC Copy, SouthJet 227. 
The plane continues to drop, increasing its nose-down attitude and speed. 
WHIP pushes both of his feet forward, stretching his body to get leverage as we can see him pulling on the yoke, trying to get the plane out of the dive it's in.

FEZZIK Guess not very long. 
Inigo and FEZZIK react. Westley is the only one not amazed. 
WESTLEY Why won't my arms move? 
He sits there, immobile, like a ventriloquist's dummy. 
FEZZIK You've been mostly dead all day. 
INIGO We had Miracle Max make a pill to bring you back. 
WESTLEY Who are you? -- Are we enemies? Why am I on this wall? -- Where's Buttercup? -- 
INIGO Let me explain -- (pauses very briefly) -- No, there is too much. Let me sum up. (MORE) 
INIGO (CONT'D) Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after I kill Count Rugen. 
WESTLEY That doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying. 
He is watching his fingers, one of which twitches now. 
FEZZIK You've just wiggled your finger. That's wonderful. 
WESTLEY I've always been a quick healer. (to Inigo) What are our liabilities? 
INIGO There is but one working castle gate. 
Fezzik helps Inigo raise Westley just high enough so he can see for himself. 
INIGO And it is guarded by sixty men. 
WESTLEY And our assets? 
INIGO Your brains, Fezzik's strength, my steel. 
CUT TO: 
WESTLEY 
absolutely stunned. 
WESTLEY That's it? Impossible. If I had a month to plan, maybe I could come up with something. But this... 
He shakes his head from side to side. 
CUT TO: 
INIGO AND FEZZIK 
FEZZIK (trying to be cheery) You just shook your head -- that doesn't make you happy? 
WESTLEY My brains, his steel, and your strength against sixty men, and you think a little head jiggle is supposed to make me happy? I mean, if we only had a wheelbarrow, that would be something. 
INIGO Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had? 
FEZZIK Over the Albino, I think. 
WESTLEY Well, why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place? What I wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak. 
INIGO There we cannot help you. 
FEZZIK (pulling one out) Will this do? 
INIGO (to Fezzik-- surprised) Where did you get that? 
FEZZIK At Miracle Max's. It fit so nice, he said I could keep it. 
WESTLEY All right, all right. Come on, help me up. 
Inigo and Fezzik do. 
WESTLEY Now, I'll need a sword eventually. 
INIGO Why? You can't even lift one. 
WESTLEY True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it? (And his bead tilts limply back. Fezzik sets it up right for him) Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside. 
INIGO I'll say -- how do I find the Count? -- Once I do, how do I find you again? -- Once I find you again, how do we escape? -- 
FEZZIK (sharply) Don't pester him, he's had a hard day. 
INIGO (nods) Right, right, sorry. 
CUT TO: 
A SHOT OF THE THREE OF THEM IN PROFILE 
They move along the wall in silence for a time. Then these words come to us on the wind -- 
FEZZIK Inigo. 
INIGO What? 
FEZZIK I hope we win...

Geoff doesn't know what to say. Eva has composed herself somewhat and blows her nose. 
EVA I can't believe that these days there's no way of handling this efficiently. 
GEORGES (CURTLY) No one's stopping you from finding out. 
Eva gets up, furious, and goes to the window. Georges follows her with his eyes. 
GEORGES (CONT'D) (PEACEABLY) Believe me, I love your mother as much as you do. So please, don't treat me as if I was a total idiot incapable of doing the obvious. 
EVA I didn't say that. I'm simply questioning whether what I see going on here is the answer to everything! 
GEOFF (TO GEORGES) Don't you want to get a second opinion? 
GEORGES Now you two had better stop, OK? Another doctor did come. He said Bertier was right. From Monday, a nurse will come three times a week. Now can we talk about something else? 
EVA Like what? 
SCENE 38 - INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Georges washes the tea cups that he used for Eva and Geoff. On the radio, the EVENING NEWS. 
SCENE 39 - INT. BEDROOM - DAY 
With expert gestures, a nurse shows Georges how to lie Anne down and put an incontinence pad on her. She's now almost incapable of moving, and has to be turned over like an object, as tears flow silently down her face. 
SCENE 40 - INT. LIVING ROOM -DAY 
Anne is at the piano and plays the piece from the Scene 3. We watch her and listen to her for a while. 
Georges is seated in his armchair and looks at the piano. Finally he leans over toward the CD player and stops it. The MUSIC suddenly stops. Georges remains silently seated. 
SCENE 41 - INT. KITCHEN - HALLWAY - BEDROOM - DAY 
He prepares a bowl of muesli, fills a sipping cup with water and brings both into the bedroom. Sits down on the bed close to Anne to feed her her food. 
GEORGES There, my love, I hope you like it. 
ANNE OK... 
He begins to feed her. 
GEORGES I added a little orange juice. I find it tastes quite good. 
She can only swallow slowly, and so something keeps running back out of her mouth. He wipes it with a tea towel, continues to feed her. Finally, after a few mouthfuls, she keeps her mouth shut.

MAN (OS. Still taunting, sounds as though on a power trip) Dont look at me. I cant help you. 
The shot transitions from the video view of Adam back into regular view in the bathroom. Adam stands in a threatening pose to the camera, speaks angrily, loudly to it, his voice dripping with sarcasm. 
ADAM Can you hear me in there? Huh? Im having a blast. (he bends down and picks up another piece of debris from the floor) This is the most fun Ive had without lubricant. (Hums the piece of debris at the window. It makes a thwacking sound, but doesnt break. Not even a crack.) Make sure youre getting everything. (Bends down, throws picks up and throws another piece of debris. It hits, but no breakage. Leans down for another piece.) 
LAWRENCE (Scoffing tone as he watches Adam trying to break the glass) Thats not going to do anything. 
ADAM (pauses, looks to Lawrence) You just want to leave it running on us? (the shot switches to surveillance view) 
LAWRENCE (very matter-of-fact) Well, you wont stop it. (shot switches to regular view) Thats why we cant cut through these chains. Its why you wont break that glass. (he gestures to the pipe then the glass) Every possible angle has been pre-thought out by him. (He appears deep in thought, starting to understand the set-up more so, figuring out the way this guy thinks. Almost admiring him. The situation may be bad, but its a brilliant design.) 
ADAM You sound like you admire this prick. 
LAWRENCE (explaining) To overcome something, you have to understand what a perfect engine it is. Thats how you fight disease. (He looks up at the ceiling, at the walls, around the room) Now the tape told us to find an X. That X has to be somewhere in this room. (determined) Help me find it. 
Adam does not help him look. He simply cannot believe Lawrences calm demeanor in this situation anymore. It seems that he is almost becoming as sick of Lawrences attitude as Lawrence is of his. He speaks a with a bit of a hyper tone again, accusingly. 
ADAM How can you be the calm Doctor Guy when your wife and kid are out there. (Shot of Lawrence looking around the room) Hes got them, too. (Shot of the clock; its now 12:05.) He could be doing anything to them right now. Are you thinking about that? 
LAWRENCE (Suddenly looks right at him, snaps angrily) I AM thinking about that. (Adam backs off a bit. Lawrence pauses a moment, his voice changes to calm but sad.) Ive been the last thing I said to my daughter. 
Lawrence turns away from Adam, placing his hand on the pipe behind him, and the shot moves up into blackness, then up at the foot of a little girls bed in a darkened bedroom. The little girl is Diana. Shes about 5 or 6 years old, with long, wavy light brown hair. She lays tucked in with her eyes closed, her favourite teddy bear wrapped in her left arm. The camera moves up and over her a bit, moving in closer to her. Chimes can be heard tinkling very faintly against a soft breeze. As the shot pauses just above her, her eyes suddenly open, blinking away sleepiness. She sits up, pulling away the covers, still holding her teddy bear. She remains sitting in her bed, staring over into the dark corner to her right. The chimes jingle away. We move in closer to her face; something has her spooked. A clock ticking is suddenly heard as the image fades from Diana getting out of bed into a strange, mechanical-looking clock on the living room wall of the Gordon Household. 
The shot lowers and we see the nicely furnished living room of the Gordon home. The walls are a dark, crimson red, the furniture in tones of red and brown. It definitely is the living room of a well-off family. Not too cold, but not as warm and homey as it could be. Diana slowly makes her way across the living room towards her parents bedroom, moving almost dream-like, her teddy bear hanging limply from her right hand. She moves to the frosted glass double doors of her parents room, opening them both into the bedroom, where we see her mother, Alison, laying on her side, fast asleep. Alison is in her early to mid thirties with long blond hair going just past her shoulders and very pretty despite her sleepiness and messy hair in this scene. Diana moves into the room, standing next to the bed, saying nothing, just watching her mother sleeping. Alisons eyes slowly open; the feeling of being watched plus the instincts of a mother have awoken her. She reaches over and turns on the light, looking upon her daughter with concern. 
ALISON Diana, Honey, are you okay? (she pushes back the covers and gets up, crouching down in front of her daughter. Looking up at her, she places her hands on her daughters arms.) Diana, Honey, can you hear me? 
DIANA (very softly, but showing almost no fear) Mommy? 
Alison reaches up and touches Dianas hair, bringing her hand down in a soft caress on Dianas cheek. 
ALISON Oh, what is it, sweet pea? 
DIANA (very calmly) Theres a man in my room. 
ALISON (sighing, but not rudely. This is not the first time this has happened) Oh Honey, are you sure hes not just hiding in your imagination?

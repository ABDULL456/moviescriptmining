RAVENNA Mirror, mirror, on the wall, Who is the fairest of them all? The bronze ripples. The Mirror Man pours out and reforms. 
MIRROR MAN My Queen, you have defied nature and robbed it of its fairest fruit. But on this day there is one more beautiful than you. 
RAVENNA More beautiful, but --

MIRROR MAN Snow White. Ravenna is shocked by this, staggers a bit. 
RAVENNA Snow White? 
(CALLS OUT) Finn'.'. (back to mirror) I should have killed her as a child. She is my undoing? 
MIRROR MAN She is also your treasure, Queen. It was wise to have kept her close for the innocence and purity that can destroy can also heal. Hold her heart in your hands and you shall never again need to consume youth. You shall never again weaken or age. Immortality without cost! Ravenna laughs, overjoyed. Finn appears out of the shadows. All he sees is his sister laughing, giddily into her mirror, no sign of the mirror man, as if it exists only in her head. 
FINN Yes, Queen?...

38 INT. PRISON TOWER/ SNOW WHITE'S CELL - DAY. 38 
Snow White paces in her cell, frantic. Two magpies appear in the window. She looks at them and watches as they flap their wings. Like they're trying to tell her something. She moves toward them. They jump back and up to the edge of the roof that is beside the cell window, hovering there. She is confused but notices -- A roofing nail, right where the Magpies hover. Snow White reaches a hand out the window and touches the loose nail. Her fingers move it back and forth as it, bit by bit, breaks free. She yanks hard.at the nail, almost has it when -- The Magpies flutter again and blast away, as if afraid --

38 CONTINUED: 38 Snow White hears FOOTSTEPS down the hall. She steadies herself, yanks once, twice and the nail comes loose. she jumps down, lies in her bed again just as -- Finn unlocks her door, leaving the key in the lock, and walks into the cell. He stands there until she turns her head slightly to him. She doesn't move, grips the nail in her closed hand as she tries to lure him closer with her eyes. 
FINN Did I wake you? Snow White shakes her head gently. 
FINN Are you always awake when I watch you? 
SNOW WHITE 
(HOARSELY) Yes. She looks away. 
SNOW WHITE You've never come in before. 
FINN My Queen won't allow it. She wants you all to herself. 
SNOW WHITE I'm afraid of her. 
FINN Not of me. 
SNOW WHITE No. He can't help himself, reaches out and touches her arm. 
FINN It's alright, princess. You will never again be locked in a cell. 
SNOW WHITE What does she want from me? His finger move from her hair to her cheek, stroking it gently, and then to her chest. With his free hand he reaches back for his dagger.

The motorcycle is parked. Peggy and Michael lie on the grass, staring down at the town lights below. Michael inhales the joint, then passes it to Peggy. 
MICHAEL This is great reefer. 
PEGGY Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old... (inhales) Travels well though. (beat) You know, the world looks a lot better from up here. 
MICHAEL The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy. 
PEGGY What are you shooting for? 
MICHAEL Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm gonna write. I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more JellO for me, Mom.' 
PEGGY Don't you get along with your parents? 
MICHAEL The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club. 
PEGGY They care about you. They're just a different generation. 
MICHAEL Hey what's with you? I thought you were cool. You rode my bike. You blew some pot. (beat) What's your scene Miss Majorette? You gonna marry Mr. Blue Impala and graze around with all the other sheep for the rest of your life? 
PEGGY I already did that. I want to be a dancer, I want to dance. 
Peggy takes off her sweater, kicks off her shoes and begins to dance. Her eyes are closed, her body silhouetted by the moon. Michael is transfixed. After a few beats, he walks over to her. He stretches out his arms and places them around her neck. They sway together for several beats, their bodies touching. Peggy opens her eyes and sees Michael gazing at her tenderly. 
MICHAEL You know, I had you pegged all wrong. 
Michael kisses Peggy. She responds passionately. 
MICHAEL A ray of oneness piercing the solitude. Falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh. You'll be a chapter in my memoirs of desire. 
PEGGY Is that one of your poems? 
MICHAEL No, I just made that up. Do you want to hear one? 
PEGGY I'd love to. 
MICHAEL (eyes ablaze) Okay. Here's a new one. It's called Tenderness. (beat) I couldn't sleep so I thought I'd scream Betrayed by a kiss, sucking pods of bitterness. In the madhouse of Dr. Dread Razor shreds of rat puke fall On my bare arms (sees Peggy grimace; he calms down) I'm sorry. I guess I was trying to impress you. (kisses her) 
Peggy is falling for it. He fumbles with her bra straps. 
PEGGY Michael... you're as good as you looked. 
His other hand reaches to undo her skirt. 
MICHAEL I'll respect you for eternity. (reciting tenderly) 'When you are old and gray, and full of sleep, And nodding by the fire, Take down this book, and slowly read, And dream of the soft look your eyes had once." (beat) I didn't write that. That's Yeats. 
Peggy is moved by the beauty of the poem. She sits up, leans over Michael, runs her hand through his hair, almost motherly. 
PEGGY I envy you. You have your whole life ahead of you and you know exactly what you want to do. (beat) But forget the rat puke; write something beautiful. 
Peggy lies back down on the ground. Michael takes her hand and kisses it. 
PEGGY You know, this isn't really happening. 
CAMERA PULLS BACK to include the entire, perfect tableau: the starry night, the motorcycle, the clouds racing across the moon and the two lovers on the mountaintop. 
EXT. STREET  DAWN 
Michael stops at the corner of Peggy's street. She gets off the bike and kisses Michael goodbye. He takes off. 
EXT. KELCHER HOUSE 
Peggy walks up the path as the MILKMAN approaches. 
MILKMAN Your parents are waiting up. You know, I see a lot of this in the spring. Good luck. 
PEGGY Thanks, Ralph. 
INT. KELCHER HOUSE 
Peggy enters, trying to be quiet. Mr. Kelcher stands in	the kitchen doorway in his bathrobe waiting for her, steaming. 
CAMERA TRACKS Peggy into kitchen. She grabs a cup of	coffee before sitting down. 
MRS. KELCHER Where have you been? 
PEGGY I went for a drive. Up in the hills. 
MR. KELCHER Damn that Charlie I 
PEGGY It's not Charlie. It's me. 
MR. KELCHER (nervously) Peggy, let me ask you something. (beat) You're not... expecting are you?

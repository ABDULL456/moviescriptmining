PATRICK First we got to get there. 
LARRY How're we going to do that floating on this garbage...? 
BOB Anyone got another set of sails? 
The Kids scramble to rig whatever canvas is available. 
SEAN Is that big thing still out there? 
MARGE Shhhh. 
CUT TO: 
HELICOPTER (AERIAL) FLY-BY 
A panorama of open ocean; a quick fly-by to orient us: First, Cable Junction, then, a mile or so ahead, the raft. 
THE RAFT 
More sail, some improvised rigging, Patrick and Lucy trimming what there is, trying to steer the clumsy contraption. From afar, the distant sound of an approaching chopper. 
LARRY Hey! 
BOB (waving) Over here! 
The Kids react with enthusiasm to the arrival of the rescue chopper. 
ANDY Don't everyone jump around! 
But they ignore him. The copter is descending. 
INT. COPTER - DAY 
A one-man light spotter; the space next to the pilot cluttered with tools and floats, lashed in place. Below, seen through the plastic bubble, the raft growing larger as the chopper sets down. 
PILOT Air One to Base. I have a positive location on that sailing party. Disabled and adrift... (he checks chart on his knee board) ...about 3/4 miles west of Cable Junction, wind and current carrying them just about due east. I count ten juveniles. 
THE RAFT 
The helicopter is creating a lot of turbulence as it sets down, a huge circular pattern of prop-wash on the surface as the rotors slow to a halt. The Kids are waving and jubilant. 
ANGLE ON THE COPTER 
As the Pilot unbuckles, opens the door, and steps out on one pontoon; he speaks through a bullhorn. 
PILOT Everyone okay? Any injuries? 
The Kids ad-lib in the affirmative. 
ANDY Can you put us on Cable Junction? 
PILOT I got no room for passengers. 
ANDY How about a tow? Can you rig that? 
The Pilot nods. Larry heaves a line to him, the Pilot catches it and makes it fast to a convenient tie-off on the undercarriage. 
LARRY As soon as you get us on the island, you got to call in. My dad's the mayor... 
ANDY (interrupting) There's a shark... 
The other Kids all chime in, adding their ad-lib shouts describing what happened, calling for help, etc. It's all a noisy jumble, the Pilot ignores it, trying to do his job. 
ANGLE ON THE RAFT 
The Kids all shouting at once; Jackie is screaming. 
JACKIE You have to take us off! You have to! Why don't you take us! 
DOUG (calming her) It's an observation spotter, he doesn't have the room... 
ANGLE ON THE PILOT 
He finishes tying off, and yells through his bullhorn at the Kids. 
PILOT Listen. I'm going to give you an assist to get you on Cable Junction. Then I'll call in, and get the Coast Guard to send a cutter. Hang on to something. 
He climbs into his bubble, shuts the door, gives the Kids a "thumbs up," and starts the engine. 
QUICK CUTS - RAFT AND CHOPPER 
Engine turning over. 
A line tied off to one of the ringbolts on an overturned hull; it pulls taut out of the water. 
INT. CHOPPER, THE PILOT INTENT ON HIS JOB. 
The raft, Kids watching in fascination and anticipation. 
The whole operation, getting under way. 
UNDERWATER 
looking up at pontoons, wreckage, wind turbulence on the surface, the heavy "thud-thud-thud" of chopper blades. 
WIDE ON THE RAFT AND CHOPPER 
In the f.g., the fin rises, and starts for the scene. 
Follow it. 
CLOSE ON THE CHOPPER 
as it starts to lift, inexplicably. The Pilot reacts as; 
THE SHARK 
attacks one of the pontoons, biting down on it, clamping great scarred jaws onto the bulbous floats.

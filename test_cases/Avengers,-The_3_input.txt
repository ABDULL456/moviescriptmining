STEED Manners, Mrs. Peel. 
Emma takes out a .38 GUN, points at his heart, FIRES -- 
BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  FOUR SHOTS -- 
80      EMMA'S POV 
-- The bullets strike his chest.  Round his heart.  Steed slumps back on the sands.  Eyes close ... 
81      EMMA 
moves over him. Drops a small toy snowshaker into his curled fingers. Blows a good bye kiss. 
82      STEED'S POV	82 
The sun.  Clouds roll by.  The camel peers down at him. 
FADE TO BLACK. 
Sound of CLACKING ... 
FADE IN: 
83      INT.  SECRET SERVICE HOSPITAL - DAY 
A hospital ward.  Empty apart from one bed.  A nurse (Brenda in her red leather), her spiked heels clacking on the floor, brings over a cup of tea to 
Steed in a hospital bed.  Who wakes, surprised to see Emma.  Peering over him.  Very nonchalant.  Eating his grapes. 
STEED Ah, Brenda ... (as she leaves) Mrs. Peel? 
EMMA You should be dead.  How do you feel? 
STEED (eyes her) Strange. 
EMMA You were very lucky.  Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank. 
STEED I wasn't about to. 
EMMA I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought you were just overdressed. 
STEED I might say the same. 
84      FROM GALLERY 
Mother with Dr. Darling taking notes.  Emma looks up at them.  Drops to a whisper. But they both are wearing headphones. 
EMMA Mother and Dr. Darling have me under observation. They think I tried to kill you. 
STEED Why should they think that? 
EMMA You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for dead. 
STEED Frankly that's how I remember it. 
EMMA But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style. 
STEED Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel. 
EMMA (conceding) That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised. 
STEED Did he say who? 
EMMA No. But he must know. Incidentally, my double left you with this. 
Emma shows Steed the toy snow scene.  A winter wonderland snow scene.  He looks puzzlingly at it.  On its underneath. "The Wonderland Corporation," followed by -- 
STEED An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...? 
EMMA Did you say formal? I must dress. 
85      EXT.  LONDON STREET - NIGHT 
The sporty Jag pulls up outside a tall, swanky building.  Steed gets out, opens her door. Irritated, Emma steps out of the car, clad in her leather suit -- 
86      CLOSEUP OF HER HEEL 
hitting the street.   PAN UP TO Steed, admiring -- 
STEED I must say, you look more your old self -- 
EMMA You mean my other self ... 
STEED Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion? 
EMMA I should have thought that was obvious ... (off his smirk) I'm in mourning. 
She moves off.  Stay on his poker face. 
STEED I can't wait to see afternoon. 
He joins her; they survey the building. 
EMMA Where's the picnic? 
They look up to -- 
87      INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT 
A boardroom suite, overlooking London.  Lights twinkling -- 
Around a conference table.  Twelve TEDDY BEARS.  Each six feet tall.  Ridiculous and sinister.  In pink, turquoise, brown, black, white, green.  Furry, giant paws and ears, swivel eyes.  One teddy sports a familiar tartan ...

ABSOLUTION - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS \nTheir leader is PERCY DOLARHYDE, a cocky, hot-tempered bastard -- he ignites another Molotov, hurls it at the CLAIMS OFFICE -- \nPERCY \nTHIS IS A MESSAGE FROM MY FATHER!

The gang rides down Main Street, HOOTING -- Percy cocks another Molotov, aiming for the SALOON -- But one of his men, half-Apache NAT COLORADO, shouts: \nNAT COLORADO Percy! N2t the saloon! \nPERCY Why the goddamn hell not?! \nNAT COLORADO Cause your dady said so. Something LOADED in the way he emphasizes \"daddy.\" Percy GLARES -- strange RESENTMENT between them. With a growl, Percy GALLOPS OFF, chucks the flaming bottle onto the CHURCH STEPS: \nINT. MEACHAN'S CHURCH - CONTINUOUS \nMeacham finishes putting out the fire, grabbing a couple blankets as he moves past The Man -- \nMEACHAM You wanna help or are you just gonna stand there and burn?! \nEXT. CHURCH - PORCH - CONTINUOUS \nFRIGHTENED TOWNSPEOPLE run for the sanctuary of the church, Meacham SWATS OUT the fire on the steps -- \nMEACHAM All right, folks -- don't panic! Get inside and you'll be fine... C'mon... Meacham tosses The Man one of the blankets, nods across the street to the GENERAL STORE which is just STARTING to burn -- \nMEACHAM (CONT'D) Put it out before it gets goin'! ON THE MAN, not sure how he suddenly became the damn fire brigade, but HUSTLING across the street to -- \nTHE GENERAL STORE \nWHIPS open the blanket, beats at the flames advancing toward the roof -- PUTS THE FIRE OUT as the door FLIES OPEN and out steps: A KID. 11. Rough n' tumble. And right now, mouth full of LICORICE. Two FULL JARS of CANDY in his hands. OOPS: \nKID Just tryin' to save the candy. (SWALLOWS, worried now) You one of my Pa's hired guns? Before he can answer, HOOFBEATS behind them -- and here's PERCY. He yanks the reins, pulls his REVOLVER on our Man -- \nPERCY Who the hell're yam? Whatever the opposite of Love At First Sight is, THIS is it: \nTHE MAN Nobody. \nPERCY Nobody is right. You think you can just collect your fifty dollars and ride off? You signed up for the wrong side, boy. The kid's scared. The Man ISN'T, despite the gun in his face: \nPERCY (CONT'D) Tell you what. You get down on your knees and kiss my boot.

PULL BACK... he's ALL THAT'S LEFT in the open range. \nINT. GOLD LEAF SALOON - NIGHT \nTHE BATWING DOORS SWING OPEN: The Man In Black enters with the dog, tips his hat to a couple WHORES. They GRIN, liking what they see. RANCH HANDS drink their pay. Behind the bar, a MAN and WOMAN argue. DOC and MARIA; she's a buxom Mexican beauty; he's 300 roly-poly pounds of ANXIOUS CASTILIAN JEALOUSY: \nDOC -- I know you are, don't lie to me! \nMARIA How many times do we have to do this, Arturo? J. love you. \nDOC Really? Do you?!? (holds up a POCKETWATCH) I found this in our bed! And I don't k3 Vg. a watch, Maria. I can't AfjQrd a watch because y insisted we buy this saloon! She looks at him SQUARELY -- yes, some SECRET withheld. As The Man In Black reaches the bar, he's Maria's EXCUSE to end this: \nMARIA We have customers. And MOVES off. Doc stomps toward the exit -- sees EMMETT at the back of the bar stealing sips of BEER from left-behind glasses: \nDOC \nAFUERA! ADULTS ONLY!!! Emmett RUNS OUT. The Man sits beside an old cuss named ATTICUS. The dog heels at The Man's feet, eyes a STEAK on Atticus' plate: \nATTICUS That mutt makes a move for my steak, I'll drill him down. \nMARIA Shut up, Atticus. This is the man who took out Percy Dolarhyde. Atticus grumbles and goes back to eating, but not before sweeping his duster aside to show the GUN in his holster. Maria rolls her eyes, sets a GLASS in front of The Man, who nods: \nTHE MAN IN BLACK I'm looking for a woman. She gestures to the WHORES -- \nMARIA What kind? \nTHE MAN IN BLACK This kind. He removes the PHOTO from inside his hat. The one of the WOMAN. \nMARIA Never seen her before. But she is beautiful. (pours him whiskey; then one for herself) Here's to you finding her, Senor. ON THE MAN. Not exactly sure he WANTS to. But they CLINK glasses, knock 'em back. Maria pours him another: \nMARIA (CONT'D) You have any idea what kind of mess you just stepped into? \nTHE MAN IN BLACK No. But I figured I'd be safe in here seein' as how that boy I tossed off his horse didn't wanna burn your saloon. Maria's eyes go down. Somehow GUILTY. But then: \nMARIA It's not the boy you should worry about. \n(OMINOUS) It's his papa. \nEXT. RANCH - NIGHT \nPOV: UPSIDE DOWN, A MAN, surrounded by his RANCH HANDS -- his FACE just out of the light, hat brim lowered under an oil lamp: \nDOLARHYDE Name's Woodrow Dolarhyde. I'm what you might call, the Tall Hog at the trough. \nHis face comes INTO light: 50's, tailored finery, patent leather Wellington boots that bespeak wealth. HARD. Exudes POWER: \nDOLARHYDE (CONT'D) You're Roy, right? Clanton, is it? Been working for me two weeks now, and I haven't had the pleasure. Our POV belongs to ROY CLANTON, the ranch hand from the cow abductions. TERRIFIED -- his arms and legs TIED TO THE SADDLES OF TWO HORSES, kicking dirt in front of Dolarhyde's RANCH HOUSE: \nCLANTON Mr. Dolarhyde, I... I swear I didn't \nSTEAL YOUR-- -- a VIOLENT \"SSST\" from Dolarhyde JOSTLES the horses -- STRETCHING Roy tight enough to SNAP -- he SCREAMS -- \nDOLARHYDE Best not to interrupt me, Roy, makes the horses skittish. \n(THEN) You partial to history? Here's a primer, \nLISTEN CLOSE: He pulls out a WHIP, gripping it by its STERLING SILVER HANDLE. Starts CIRCLING the horses as he lets the whip UNFURL: \nDOLARHYDE (CONT'D) Following the War Of Northern Aggression -- what some ironically refer to as the \"Civil\" War -- came a prodigious nation- wide market for beef. Cowtowns sprang up all along these prairies, Roy; populated by enterprising young drovers -- among 'em, my daddy, Jeremiah Dolarhyde. Sold six of his gold teeth and a sword gifted to him by Robert E. Lee for twenty of the scrawniest Longhorns you ever saw -- then turned 'em into the fattest herd West of the Chisholm Trail. (stops: the WHIP) Watched him work this lash, driving those steer til his fingers bled... but what good's a whip without a herd, Roy? And slowly, torturously, SWEEPS the whip tip in the dirt... \nROY CLANTON Mr. Dolarhyde, Sir, you gotta believe me -- I went to take a piss and and -- saw a light in the sky -- blue -- and when I ran back the cows and fellas were gone! \nELLA His name's 'Happy.' HappyBARES HIS TEETH. INCHES from Atticus' face \nATTICUS I'm sorry... 'Happy.' \nELLA Alright then. (lowers her rifle) You're right. That was fun. \n-- Atticus scrambles back to his feet and OUT the door, as Ella looks at the Man In Black: \nELLA (CONT'D) What're you doing with my dog? \nTHE MAN IN BLACK I was hoping you could tell me. \nELLA The hell're you talking ab--? WRIST BRACELET. Surprise and REVELATION: \nELLA (CONT'D) Where... did you get that? Before he can answer, SHERIFF TAGGART enters, along with DEPUTY WADE (carrying a SHOTGUN), and 5 other deputies. They move cautiously to THE MAN, like he's a powder keg about to go off... \nSHERIFF TAGGART Hey there, \"Luke.\" Mind following me down to the office so we can have us a chat...? \nTHE MAN IN BLACK \n(CONFUSED; ALERT) What for? \nSHERIFF TAGGART All due respect, I'm the law, mister. That's what for. The men LOCK EYES: \nTHE MAN IN BLACK Tell you what, Sheriff. How about you keep the fifty dollars you owe me and I just walk outta here like we. never met? \nSHERIFF TAGGART Because we did meet. ON ELLA. For reasons we're not sure of, the idea of The Man leaving ALARMS her. All the Gunslingers' hands are POISED by holsters. The Man stays preternaturally COOL: \nTHE MAN IN BLACK L can't be accountable for what happens if they draw on me. \nSHERIFF TAGGART And what's gonna happen? \nTHE MAN IN BLACK Best you don't find out. \nSHERIFF TAGGART Now why'd you have to go and say that? Taggart gives a nod and the men start to CONVERGE -- \nTHE MAN IN BLACK (low; genuine plea) Don't. But Charlie makes a MOVE and The Man SLAMS his head into a pole -- the NEXT GUNMAN reaches for his pistol -- The Man PUNCHES his THROAT -- SLAMS the third into a bench -- The FOURTH straight down on the Faro table -- TAGGART levels his REPEATER -- but The Man just GRABS the barrel as Taggart FIRES a ROUND into the ceiling -- now the rifle's in THE MAN'S HANDS and just before he PULLS THE TRIGGER on Taggart: HE SEES EMMETT AT THE WINDOW. About to watch his father's MURDER... and The Man LOWERS the gun: \nTHE MAN IN BLACK (CONT'D) I told you, I don't wanna hurt anyb-- CRACK! The butt of a PISTOL WHIPS the side of his SKULL! The Man DROPS as we REVEAL who just knocked his ass OUT: ELLA! Taggart draws a gun and pins The Man, whipping out that piece of paper he pulled from his office... \nSHERIFF TAGGART Yup -- looks just like him. \nNOW WE IT'S A WANTED POSTER WITH THE MAN'S FACE ON IT: \nSHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D) \"Jake Lonergan. Scourge a' The Territories. Wanted Dead or Alive.\" And The Man... now forever known as JAKE... stares WOOZILY into his OVERTURNED HAT... the photo tucked inside of the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN... her image goes BLURRY... then mil{: \nAND WHAM: \nMEMORY FLASHCUTS1 STROBELIXE IMAGES -- 1.) A tilted, handmade trail sign: \"SAGUARO PASS.\" 2.) We're in a CABIN somewhere. BLINDING ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT EXPLODES INTO THE CABIN, against which a DEMONIC SILHOUETTE appears -- it looks like an INDIAN IN FULL-FEATHER HEADDRESS -- \n3.) A WOMAN'S FACE -- THE WOMAN FROM JAKE'S PHOTOGRAPH -- she looks at us and SCREAMS -- 4.) Now we're someplace VERY DARK -- a cave? As some kind of TERRIFYING OCULAR PROBE lowers right in front of our eyes -- 5.) Now we're RUNNING through the cave -- ESCAPE -- BREATHING HARD -- a LIGHT at the end of the tunnel -- BLINDING SUN hits us as we emerge -- our eyes ADJUST to see: 6.) A STRANGE ROCK FORMATION on the rim of a canyon -- like a STONE TOWER pointing to heaven as the SUN WHITEWASHES US TO: \nINT. JAIL CELL - PRE-DAWN \nJAKE'S EYES OPEN and he GASPS AIR! His POV: a FACE comes into FOCUS -- PERCY DOLARHYDE. GRINNING at him from the next cell: \nPERCY You're a dead. Jake sits up. Woozy. Blinking back to reality. \nPERCY (CONT'D) My daddy's comin' for me, Boy. You're gonna end up another dead shitheel under his spurs. I am gonna watch you suffer for a long, long -- Jake moves LIGHTNING QUICK -- reaching through the bars, GRABBING PERCY'S COLLAR, YANKING FORWARDS -- SLAMMING Percy's head into the bars, KNOCKING hIM OUT COLD AGAIN. Percy DROPS. \nJAKE Shut up. Jake sits back on his cot, rubbing his still-throbbing head. \nEXT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - JAIL - CONTINUOUS \nA PRISON WAGON pulls up in front of the Sheriff's office, along with Taggart's GUNMEN on horseback. ELLA takes frame as the men dismount and head into the office -- she pursues DEPUTY WADE with a real sense of PURPOSE: \nCHARLIE Best way to make a man stay put: chain him to his enemy. \n(A GRIN) You lovebirds have a nice trip now. SLAM: the door CLOSES and LOCKS. Jake SIGHS and tries to sit back, but it's hard tethered to Percy's slumped form. Shit. Then QWW -- something starts to STING and he looks down: HIS BRACELET. Has started PULSING RED. And it's getting WARM. Jake stares -- ON EDGE -- what the hell's happening? As -- OUTSIDE, Taggart mounts the buckboard. EMMETT feeds the horses: \nEMMETT You sure he's a bad guy, Pa? He did give Percy a lickin'. \nSHERIFF TAGGART He's bad enough. \nEMMETT (not so sure, but --) . can I come with you? \nSHERIFF TAGGART Too dangerous. \nEMMETT Dangerous to drive a damn coach? Why can't Charlie just take him? \nSHERIFF TAGGART Because it's my job, Emmett. That's what these people pay me to do. And your mother would kill me if I brought you. Emmett looks off, half sad, half angry -- \nEMMETT Good thing she's already dead then. And turns without a goodbye. Taggart watches him leave, wishing he could connect. Takes the reins and looks up -- REACTS: THAT MASSIVE. FRIGHTENING CLOUD IN THE SKY -- roiling faster toward town. The scary BLUE FLASHES within grow more INTENSE. IN THE COACH -- WITH JAKE, looking at the BRACELET, the pulsing growing MORE FREQUENT -- and then, a VOICE: \nELLA (0.S. ) \nHEY! Jake turns to see ELLA, pushed up against the coach window: \nELLA (CONT'D) Tell me where you got that bracelet... \nJAKE Maybe you should'a asked before you knocked me out.. \nELLA Please... I need to know. Just tell me where you got it. \nJAKE Y dOli' .xBmbgX - - I don' t remember my name or where I've been or any of the things they said I done, so leave me the hell alone. And sits back as the coach starts to MOVE, leaving Ella in the dust. Some of the gunmen ride atop it; others on horseback cover the coach in a protective ring. Wade sees something incoming from the NORTH: \nDEPUTY WADE \nKYLE!!! Taggart looks up: Dolarhyde's gang racing down the mountain -- \nSHERIFF TAGGART \nDAMNIT -- He unslings his SHOTGUN as his men ready their weapons -- ON DOLARHYDE'S GANG, riding hard, guns ready too -- This is about to get UGLY. BUT... from the OTHER end of town, the WIND picks up -- As the massive storm cloud seems shockingly to have STORED AT A H -- its EYE churning, ROARING and... TWO BOLTS OF BLUE LIGHTNING CRACK DOWN FROM IT! Happy starts BARKING MADLY. Ella sees the lightning and starts to BACK AWAY in fear: \nELLA NonoNO -- GET TO YOUR CELLARS! EVERYONE \nUNDERGROUND NAT! But her cries are LOST as -- RRRRRRRR!!!!! \nA LONG, NARROW FUNNEL SHOOTS FROM THE CHURNING CLOUD: A TORNADO! \nBREAKING THE MOMENTUM OF THE SHOWDOWN -- The stagecoach UPENDS, FLIPPING SIDEWAYS as the animals try to break free -- Taggart and his men are THROWN -- Inside, Jake and Percy TUMBLE end-over-end -- SLAMMING into walls, LOCKED TOGETHER -- JARRING Percy back to consciousness -- Dolarhyde's men are THROWN from their horses too as the animals STAMPEDE OFF in different directions -- THE 1Q8k=O ENGULFS THE TOWN! THE CONCUSSIVE BLAST BUCKLES \nBUILDINGS, PULLING WHOLE SECTIONS OF THEM INTO THE SKY! \nTHE TELEGRAPH OFFICE. SHERIFF'S STATION. BROTHEL. WOOD \nSTRIPPED RIGHT OFF THEIR FALSE FRONTS LIKE PIANO KEYS! Okay, wait. Just wait. Take a breath. 'Cause it's about ... . to get... . MORE insane... \nTEN MANTA RAY-SHAPED HOVER-SPEEDERS BURST FROM THE CYCLONE! ROARING into the town, FLYING just above ground -- \nTOWNSPEOPLE'S FACES -- GOING DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE -- 19TH \nCENTURY BRAINS TRYING TO PROCESS THE IMPOSSIBLE -- \nMEACHAM Jesus God!! STRANGE STEEL RINGS fire from the speeders and mushroom out -- KA-CHING! -- SNAP OPEN and CLAMP around necks, arms, legs -- and from these steel collars, CABLES LASH OUT, whip-snapping back to the speeders and TETHERING MAGNETICALLY to them -- \nYeah-these are HIGH-TECH LASSOS: \nHELPLESS VICTIMS ARE YANKED OFF THE GROUND AND PULLED BEHIND THE SPEEDERS LIKE ROPED STEER! Two of TAGGART'S GUNMEN. Now some of DOLARYHYDE' S. Screaming, just gone. THIS IS A...Qlp lam. EMMETT -- stunned -- as SHERIFF TAGGART runs for him -- \nSHERIFF TAGGART \nMeacham ushers people into the church as WALLS SHAKE, PEWS JUMP: \nINT. BLACKSMITH'S SHOP - CONTINUOUS \nDOC AND MARIA burst in, huddle under a window. Across the room, a YOUNG MAN clamps a hand over his TERRIFIED WIFE's mouth -- \nCRAAASFI! MORE RINGS SMASH THROUGH THE WALL, YANKING THE YOUNG \nCOUPLE THROUGH IT! ANOTHER RING CLAMPS AROUND MARIA'S NECK! \nMARIA \nAYUDAMEEEEEEE! Doc LEAPS after her but her collar's LASSO CABLE whips out, TETHERING to a passing Speeder and she's RIPPED OUT THE DOOR -- \nDOC \nMARIA!!! \nEXT. BIRDCAGE THEATER - CELLAR - CONTINUOUS \nELLA -- hurrying Emmett toward the theater's CELLAR DOOR, but a SPEEDER circles around and ROARS toward them -- ON JAKE. He SEES this -- and suddenly, to HIS surprise as much as OURS... HIS BRACELET ACTIVATES! METAL COMING TO LIFE, coiling up around his arm -- WHAT? HOW? -- as it becomes... \nA SMART GUN BLASTER WE PON! A HOLOGRAPHIC SCOPE MATERIALIZES, tracking that speeder as it DESCENDS on Ella and the mother and: \nBALLLLAMMMI THE BLASTER FIRES A PULSE, VAPORIZING THE SPEEDER \nMID-AIR! THE RECOIL HURTLES JAKE BACK 15 FEET, INTO A WALL. Ella reaches the CELLAR DOOR with Emmett. LOCKED. Sees a HATCHET in a stump -- rips it out and HAMMERS the lock to bits: \nELLA Everyone inside! GO GO GO!! Ushering Emmett and TOWNSFOLK underground, PULLS the door SHUT -- \nEXT. ABSOLUTION - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS \nJAKE stumbles up... as a speeder FIRES A RING AT HIM. But reflexively, his WRIST WEAPON FIRES ANOTHER BLAST, vaporizing it! He looks down at the blaster: \"Hell y .\" Another speeder circles around -- KABOOM! The blaster's incredible firepower SPIRALS THE SPEEDER OUT OF CONTROL, it \nCRASHES INTO: \nINT. MEACHAM'S CHURCH - CONTINUOUS \nThe speeder PLOWS through, parishioners flee -- the CHURCH BELL breaks from the BELL TOWER -- CRASHES DOWN ON THE SPEEDER -- \nEXT. TOWN STREETS - CONTINUOUS \nAs Jake keeps FIRING, the last speeders turn tail and RETREAT -- disappearing back INTO THE TORNADO as the cloud overhead OPENS UP and INHALES the swirling mass, which spirals to the heavens. ... GONE. The massive cloud seems to VAPORIZE and the DESERT SUN returns... debris flutters... smoke clears... And all... is... STILL. As our CAMERA RISES to reveal... HALF THE BUILDINGS HAVE BEEN \nSUCKED INTO THE SKY. \nFrom the rubble, SURVIVORS EMERGE: EMMETT and ELLA from the cellar with inhabitants. DOLARHYDE. DOC. Al in SHOCK: \nDOC Maria -- oh God-- they t-took her-- What just...? MOANS, WAILS... desperate cries as people search for loved ones. JAKE'S BLASTER -- RETRACTS, folding in on itself -- shrinks down to size, reverting back into a BRACELET. He's stunned. So are the remaining townsfolk. DOLARHYDE is first to speak: \nDOLARHYDE Who the hell're ? \nNAT COLORADO He's the one who caged Percy. Dolarhyde starts MOVING toward Jake -- wild killer eyes -- \nDOLARHYDE Whatwere__tho_se__thinae? \nJAKE -- why're you asking m&?! Dolarhyde GRIPS Jake's arm -- THE BRACELET: \nDOLARHYDE This! Where'd you get this?! It was shooting the same light beams they were -- \nJAKE Let go of my wrist. \nDOLARHYDE -- I'm not lettin' go of nothin' til you tell me what the he-- KA-LLLANG!! Suddenly that CHURCH BELL comes HURTLING out of the church wreckage, PLOWS through debris. People scatter. And out of the church stumbles... AN ALIEN. 8 FT. TALL. Standing upright, limbs inverted -- limbs that DRAG, wounded, as people SCREAM and RUN and Jake and Dolarhyde can only stare, jaws dropped, and the monster LUNGES: WHUPWHUP -- something SPINNING through the air -- A HATCHET --- \nSCHLUCK!!!! -- EMBEDDING IN THE ALIEN'S HEAD! WHIP TO -- ELLA, hang iust hurled it. The alien lets out a DEATH RATTLE then FALLS FORWARD, the hatchet embedding deeper as it HITS THE DIRT. Holy SHIT. \nEMMETT Sorry, Father. Doc covers his face with his handkerchief as he explores... \nDOC Chet wall's partially collapsed... no familiar organs of any kind... \nDOLARHYDE 'course they're not familiar. Just look at this th-- \nSUDDENLY THE ALIEN'S ARM LASHES OUT -- claws SNAP OPEN and PIN Dolarhyde against the wall! Everyone tries to PRY the claws from his neck -- but the second Doc withdraws his hands from the alien's chest, its arm goes LIMP. Dolarhyde drops, GASPING... \nDOC Spinal reflex. And GRINS at Dolar's pain. But Meacham NOTICES something around Dolar's neck where the alien pinned him, like a ring of DUST: \nMEACHAM Something on your neck. Hold still. Meacham sweeps a little off Dolar's neck, rubs it between thumb and forefinger. The dust GLINTS under the kerosene lamp: \nMEACHAM (CONT'D) I'll be damned... gold. They check the creature's hand talons: GOLD FLAKES underneath 'em, and Lots of it. Colorado checks its taloned feet: \nNAT COLORADO Down here too. (looks to Dolar) This much ore... could only have come from a digging in a mine. That LANDS on everyone. but most especially ELLA. Who looks up to see Jake READING her in this moment. \nEMMETT In the ALIEN'S EYE is a SMALL FLASHING LIGHT. On/Off/On/Off in time with that BEEP BEEP BEEP. \nDOC Gimme my scalpel. In MACRO CU, DOC CUTS INTO THE EYE, WET SQUISHY SOUNDS as he pulls it from its socket, attached to a STRINGY OPTIC NERVE dripping with juice. Clamped to the nerve is a METALLIC ORB: -- he takes hold of the blinking orb. It FLARES to life, the light coalescing into a 3-D ARROW-LIKE HOLOGRAM. Confusion. Doc REMOVES it from the optic nerve and the hologram DISAPPEARS: \nDOLARHYDE Where'd it go? The hell'd you do? \nDOC Nothing, just pulled it off -- He reconnects it to the optic nerve, the hologram REAPPEARS: \nDOC (CONT'D) Only works when it's touching the creature. Colorado moves closer... rainbow light flickering across his face... \nNAT COLORADO I think... it's a compass. Look: (fiddles with tweezers) No matter how you move it, it points in the same direction. \nEMMETT Compasses point north. That's west. \nMEACHAM (realizing; to Jake) West's where 141 came from. ON JAKE. Another puzzle piece falling into place. \nEMMETT If you're right, what's it pointing to? \nELLA The rest of 'em. \n(THEN) Be my guess. \nDOLARHYDE Then that's where I'm goin'. He SNAPS his PISTOL open, loading bullets: \nDOLARHYDE (CONT'D) One of my ranchers said my herd disappeared into the sky. 'Til about ten minutes ago, I figured him for a liar. (SNAPS barrel closed) Nobody takes my cattle. \nMEACHAM Your b was taken too. A FLASH of something from Dolarhyde -- could that be EMOTION? But just as fast, it's GONE. Almost a THROWAWAY: \nDOLARHYDE I noticed. \nNAT COLORADO What if they're already dead? \nEMMETT They're not dead. \nELLA Kid's right. If all they wanted was to kill us, they would've. \nDOLARHYDE Looked to me like... they were ropin' people. \n(THEN) Means they need 'em for something. Whatever it is, we can either stand here guessin'... or go find out. His eyes flash to Nat: \"C'mon.\" And they EXIT. Everyone looks at each other, working up the courage to face what they know they must. Doc grabs his SHOTGUN, starts gathering shells: \nDOC If she's alive -- if there's even a \nCHANCE -- \nMEACHAM Lord hates a coward... but our bullets were useless against those things. Other than his wrist gizmo, we're outgunned and outnumbered. As one by one, they turn... to JAKE. Who until this point has been mostly SILENT. Observing. But now -- he's gone from enemy to potential savior in a heartbeat. \nJAKE Whoa, I got nothing to do with this -- \nELLA You got everything to do with it. If you can remember where you got that thing -- \nEMMETT I can protect myself -- shoot, I'm the only master bowman in my archery club. Won the county tournament by shootin' a flipped nickel at 50 paces. \nMEACHAM Somethin' tells me these things don't carry nickels, son. Answers's no. \nEMMETT You want me to ride off with the chickenshits, then double back, be happy to. But let's just skip that part and get to it, Padre. And that's the truth. Meacham sighs, no choice... finally: \nMEACHAM Go fill your canteen, dammit. He SLAPS the reins and the wagon rides off. Emmett GRINS and mounts the pony, then sees... JAKE riding past. ANGRY EYES from Ella as she heels her horse and TROTS OFF angrily: \nELLA C'mon, Happy. But HAPPY remains, torn between them, tail wagging and looking up at Jake as if to say: PLEASE COME? \nJAKE Oh shut up. Suppressing GUILT, he rides on toward the hills -- as Dolarhyde VEERS his horse in front of Jake, cutting him off: \nDOLARHYDE I was ridin' into town to kill you for what you done to my son. You owe me your life, Boy. \n(BEAT) Ride with us, we'll call it square. His hand rests on his nickel-plated .38. Eyes gleaming cruelly. \nJAKE You that fast? \nDOLARHYDE \nFAST ENOU-- -- WHOOSH: Jake's hand is already UP with his own PISTOL, having drawn before Dolarhyde can finish his sentence: \nJAKE Now you owe me y.Q= life. We're square. In a DAZZLING TWIRL, Jake slaps it back in his holster. Point made, he RIDES ON. Dolarhyde, burning mad at having been out- drawn, turns to CULOBAI)U -- speaks LOW: \nDOLARHYDE Follow him. Soon as he's got his back turned... kill him. \nShit. Colorado hesitates. Dolar GLARES: \"Do it.\" Finally Colorado NODS acquiescence, moves off... JAKE -- on the OUTSKIRTS of town now -- riding past Meacham and Doc on the WAGON: \nMEACHAM Figure out which way you're headed yet? \nJAKE West. Saguaro Pass. \nMEACHAM That's not what I meant. The inference LANDS on Jake. But he's in no mood. GALLOPS off. Meacham watches Jake go... MUSIC RISES AS WE DISSOLVE THROUGH: \nEXT. DESERT PLAINS \nJAKE -- RIDING HARD THROUGH THE DESERT: A man running from his demons, or maybe toward them... through plains and pasturage... until he sees the tilted ROAD SIGN: \"SAGUARO PASS.\" Up ahead, he sees DEBRIS... Part of a ROOF, lying broken on the ground. Pieces of a STONE CHIMNEY. Jake comes over a rise... to REVEAL: \nEXT. ABANDONED CABIN - DAY \nA DESTROYED LOG CABIN. Walls partially TORN AWAY. Something in Jake is DEEPLY STIRRED. Dismounts, tentatively... walks up to the PORCH. Boots CRUNCH over broken window glass as they ENTER: \nINT. ABANDONED CABIN - CONTINUOUS \nLIGHT BEAMS stream in. Eerie quiet. Jake takes it in, HAUNTED. Something CRUNCHES under his boot -- DRIED FLOWERS. Sticking out from an OVERTURNED CRACKED VASE. Jake BLINKS, affected -- Bends over, TOUCHES the VASE AS: MEMORY FLASECUT! FRESH FLOWERS in a woman's hand... THE W B& FROM JAKE'S PICTURE. She smiles at him -- \nTHE WOMAN You shouldn't have. She turns, drops the flowers into the vase as we see she's talking to JAKE. \nJAKE Got you somethin' else. \nCLINK -- He drops a LEATHER POUCH on the table next to the vase. A FEW GOLD COINS clink out. The woman turns to him, WORRIED: \nTHE WOMAN Where'd you get this? \nJAKE Where do you think? The woman looks to the pouch -- Picks up one of the coins. TORN. Jake moves behind her. Close. An INTIMACY here. \nTHE WOMAN Your boys '11 come after you. ON JAKE. Dark. But DETERMINED: \nJAKE Let 'em come. She turns to him, their eyes HOLD... and they KISS. Soft. Tender. Soulful. But then -- a THUNDERCRACK turns their attention to the window: A STORM CLOUD on the horizon. Same kind that consumed the town. The cabin starts to VIBRATE like a tuning fork. The pouch slides off the table... THE GOLD COINS SPILL OUT and -- \nBACK TO PRESENT - JAKE REELING. What is this memory? Who the hell is the woman? Something GLINTS in the far wall where the chimney used to be: \nONE OF THE GOLD COINS EMBEDDED in the wood. Jake pulls it out of the wall, a thousand questions in his eyes. Sunlight SHIMMERS off it and -- MEMORY FLASHCUT! The spilled coins start SLIDING across the floor all by themselves, as if magnetically drawn to THE CHIMNEY -- WHOOSH! -- SUCKED right up into it by some VACUUM FORCE! \nTHE WOMAN What's happening?!!! \nMEACHAM That can't be good. The plummeting object HITS a distant dune, kicking up a SAND \nPLUME -- ROLLING TOWARD THEM -- \nDOLARHYDE Scatter. \n-- everyone runs their horses aside as the object BOUNCES over rocks -- then SLOWS... to a STOP. They STARE. Finally Dolarhyde kicks his horse forward slowly... DISMOUNTS, draws his GUN. What he sees is SHOCKING: It's an OVAL CAPSULE OF BLUE GOO, the outer layer some kind of TRANSLUCENT COCOON. Suspended within the murky Jell-o is a GE, DEC SHAPE. Motionless. UH-OH. The others draw guns too, converging around it in equal SHOCK and FEAR. But the thing doesn't MOVE. \nDOC Should we... open it? \nDOLARHYDE Should we open it? Hell NO we shouldn-- \nEMMETT -- oops -- -- and now we find Emmett's already POKING it with a stick, a Small TEAR in the cocoon's outer embryonic layer -- GOO leaks -- then it RUPTURES, EXPLODING as the horses REAR away, WHINNYING the goo spreads across the desert floor, thinning out. BEAT. Everyone wipes blue shit off their clothes as they come FACE-TO-FACE with the object inside, lying there on the ground: \nA COW. YES, A COW. Motionless. DEAD, in fact. A METAL TUBE jammed in its mouth, connected to a VALVE in the now-flaccid bubble's outer shell. Greavey notices a BRANDING on the cow's rump -- the letter \"D\": \nGREAVEY Boss... it's one'a yours. Dolarhyde's eyes NARROW. Emmett looks at Doc, SCARED: \nEMMETT Is-- is this what happened to my Pa? Doc dismounts. Moves to the cow's mouth and PULLS OUT THAT TUBE with a wet SQUISHING sound. Thinking it through: \nDOC This was stuck down its throat... to help it breathe. That means they wanted to keep it alive, Emmett. (forces a small smile) I'm sure your father is fine. But Doc's eyes aren't sure. Meacham looks back to the sky: \nMEACHAM Why'd they dump it? \nELLA Whatever they needed from it, they must've got. \n(THEN) Gonna get dark soon, need to keep moving. She does. The others FOLLOW in a chilled daze. The last is DOLARHYDE, glancing back at his dead cow with angry eyes... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. RIDGE ABOVE VALLEY - DUSK \nNow our people APPEAR riding up a ridge... Dolarhyde shoots up a HAND, bringing the caravan to a STOP. Once again, SHOCK: \nEMMETT Ho-ly shit. BOOM UP to reveal a SURREAL SIGHT in the valley below: AGAMBLING RIVERBOAT. Nose buried in the sand, paddlewheels facing the sky, as if it'd been dropped from the clouds into the desert. Just like that cow. Off their LOOKS -- \nEXT. DESERT - THE PADDLEBOAT - MINUTES LATER \nTRACKING alongside of the TILTED PADDLEBOAT, our team rides around it. Trying to make SENSE. STENCILED on the stern is... \nDOC \"Colorado Queen.\" \n(THEN) The river's two hundred miles from here. But Ella doesn't seem as impressed as the rest of them. In fact, her attention is drawn BEHIND them, to something coming up over the DUNES... the barest flicker of a smile -- \nELLA Son of a bitch. IT'S JAKE ON HORSEBACK. Followed by another horse, with COLORADO in the saddle. Wrists tied but ALIVE. As Jake rides to a stop, he PUSHES Colorado off the horse -- the indian HITS the ground with a THUD as Jake levels Dolarhyde with HARD EYES: \nJAKE Your man got it in his head that he was s'posed to kill me. I'm holding onto his ear 'til he says sorry. \nAs Colorado stumbles to his feet angrily, humiliated, Dolar notices his BLOODY EAR. The LOBE has been SHOT OFF. He looks up at Jake, half-angry, half-EMBARRASSED -- \nDOLARHYDE Why'd you let him live? Jake's hard-as-nails. DRIVEN now -- \nJAKE Gonna need him. He rides past Dolar to Ella. Stops. Says, simply: \nJAKE (CONT'D) Nice boat. (then... SNIFFS) What's that smell? \nELLA That'd be me. He realizes her shirt's caked in the BLUE GOO from the cow. \nJAKE Why're you blue? \nELLA \n(DRYLY) Cause I missed ya. Their look HOLDS. A MOMENT. Something REAL between them. \nDOLARHYDE We better keep movin'. A THUNDERCRACK. On the horizon, sheets of RAIN. \nELLA Why didn't you say anything? \nJAKE Givin' you privacy. She throws her shirt on, but her skin's wet and the shirt glues to her, celebrating her shape in a way that can't be ignored. Jake tosses her his jacket. As she slips it on, she notices a bottle of WHISKEY on the table... and the PHOTOGRAPH OF ALICE. \nELLA . she's pretty. (Jake says NOTHING) Who was she? Jake's quiet. DARK. Intense emotion, intensely suppressed: \nJAKE only thing I know's her name was Alice... \n(THEN; DISTANT) And she's dead. Ella looks up at him. INTO him -- \nELLA Maybe you loved her. Jake shakes his head, sort of mumble/chuckles in RESISTANCE: \nJAKE All you women are the same -- Always wanna make it about Goddamn \"love.\" \nELLA \n(A BEAT) Trust me, Lonergan. I'm not the same. There is a force -- a strength about this woman -- that he connects with. But remains, true to character, ALOOF: \nJAKE Don't matter. She takes a step closer. Soft. Intimate. \nELLA So what dj= matter? Jake just looks at her. Then, lifts the cheroot to his lips, the FLARE of its tip casting him in a demonic light... \nJAKE What matters is I find the thing that killed her. (dark as hell) And make it pay. And now, he leans forward with a focused LOOK... holds up his \nBRACELET: \nJAKE (CONT'D) Where'd you see this before? A beat. Ella -- somehow CONTAINED -- opens her mouth to lie. But he cuts her off -- \nJAKE (CONT'D) -- and don't lie to me. You wouldn't've asked me if you didn't recognize it. Ella tightens. PAIN in her eyes. And Jake REALIZES: \nJAKE (CONT'D) Those things... they the ones who put those marks on your back? She swallows: a mixture of SHAME that he's found her out... and ANGER at what was done to her. \nELLA They took my people. Destroyed where I'm from. \nJAKE Where's that? \nELLA North of here. Been trackin' 'em ever since, town to town. Best I figure, they're hidin' in a mine. Jake CONSIDERS all this. Softens a little: \nJAKE Maybe if you'd told me the truth instead of throwin' rocks at me -- \nELLA -- what, you would've stuck around? Bullshit. I couldn't've turned you away from what you had to do, any more than I could've stopped these people from going after their kin. \n(BEAT) Truth ain't worth a damn, Jake... and we're gonna need all the guns we can get. Their look HOLDS... until Jake SMIRKS. Likes her style: \nJAKE So that's the only reason you wanted me to come with you? Cause of my gun? There's a pause... then Ella SMIRKS back: \nELLA No, not your gun. \n(BEAT) What you do with it. Among the many things these two ate feeling -- both separately and together -- the one that pops right now is ATTRACTION. Confusing as it is for him. The pregnant moment LINGERS... Until Happy suddenly starts to GROWWWWL, sensing something outside. ANOTHER CRACK OF THUNDER as: \nINT. STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS \nThe horses STAMP NERVOUSLY out the window as Greavey and the rest of Dolarhyde's men (COBBETT and 4 others) HUDDLE in secret conference -- whispers that sound a lot like MUTINY -- \nGREAVEY What the hell're we doin' here? We should be ridin' in the opposite direction of those things -- \nCOBBETT We do that, the old man's likely to shoot us himself. Only way outta this is -- And suddenly. Greavey SNIFFS the air, FROWNS: \nGREAVEY . what's that smell? -- as they TURN to the deck where the creature lays... ALL THEY \nFIND IS AN EMPTY TARP FLAPPING AIMLESSLY: \nCOBBETT \nAW SH-- LIGHTNING FLASHES, illuminating the ship -- and als4THE ALIEN behind them. a coiled mass clinging spiderlike to the ceiling!!! Its arm WHIPS out, noosing around Cobbett -- LIFTS HIM off his feet -- SLAMS HIM into the ceiling -- TOSSES HIM like a ragdoll: The men SHOUT -- a PAIR OF RAZOR SHARP CANINES extrude from the alien then it SPRINGS -- SLICING THROUGH TWO MEN AT ONCE -- GREAVEY and 2 others manage to SCRAMBLE AWAY: \nJAKE -- WE GOTTA GO M! But Jake can't let go -- FURY -- HEARTBREAK -- Doc PULLS HIM away -- Jake SNAGS THE CRUCIFIX off Meacham's neck as he's forced OUT, leaving Meacham's body to be CONSUMED BY FLAMES -- \nEXT. UPENDED RIVERBOAT - DESERT - NIGHT \nThe boat is a BALL OF FIRE in the pouring rain, as what remains of our heroes stumble out, COUGHING, devastated... Jake, Doc, Dolarhyde, Colorado, Greavey, 2 GUNMEN... and Ella and Happy atop a DUNE, following a TRAIL OF FLUORESCENT ORANGE BLOOD streaking into the desert. Happy BARKING MADLY. Ella drops to a knee, touches the orange blood as it WASHES AWAY in the rain: \nELLA \nRAIN'S GONNA COVER ITS TRACKS! \nNAT COLORADO That thing... was dead... it was d-ead... DOLARHYDE, RAIN pouring down his face... VULNERABLE and GUILTY: \nDOLARHYDE I couldn't stop it -- It just... grabbed the kid. ON JAKE. Rage-filled against the flames... Meacham's CRUCIFIX in his hared, as his FIST closes around it. Looks up, HARDCORE: \nJAKE Then we'd better get him back. \nSMASH TO: \nINT. STALACTITE CAVERN - NIGHT \nSTALACTITES loom from the ceiling -- BAM! EMMETT is DROPPED on the floor of a sinister cave -- scrambles back from THE ALIEN: \nEMMETT Damn. You are one ugly bastar-- PSST! The alien spits a RESIN GOB on Emmett's mouth -- PSST PSST! More gobs PIN his limbs to the wall. Emmett can't move -- can't speak -- eyes WIDE and TERRIFIED -- The creature looks down at an ARMOR PLATE on its bicep. Touches a series of keys and the armor spits out what looks like... .. a small RUBIK'S CUBE made of some alien alloy. The creature casually TOSSES IT in the air where it FLOATS and starts to SPIN -- as it does, its sides FLIP AND TURN (like a Rubik's Cube) -- emitting HIGH-PITCHED SONAR BEEPS: This thing's some kind of HOMING BEACON. Off Emmett's WIDE, GAPING EYES... \nEXT. DESERT PLAINS - SUNRISE \nOur people RIDE FAST against the rising sun, on the hunt for Emmett. Colorado REARS his horse, kneels by a trace of ORANGE BLOOD on some rocks. \nNAT COLORADO (looks off --) West. Greavey and the others share a LOOK. E o Turn to Dolar -- \nGREAVEY Boss, only took one of them things to kill four of us. We got no chance here. Dolarhyde BURNS -- knowing he's being ABANDONED -- \nDOLARHYDE You're a goddamn coward. (to the others) You work for me, dammit. You're my m e 1 1 Qyees. And Greavey, finally FREE to speak his mind, says SPITEFULLY: \nGREAVEY Fine line between a coward and a fool. The men turn tail and RIDE AWAY. Dolarhyde SHOUTS after them -- \nDOLARHYDE You're all FIRED! Doc takes the opportunity to TWIST the knife: \nDOC Looks like they finally found something to be more scared of than you. Dolarhyde feels his world CRUMBLING away man by man... Ella trots alongside Jake, who's staring at that DARK CLOUD MASS overhead with a bad feeling: \nJAKE Clouds've been moving east since sun- up... 'cept that one. ON ELLA. We SENSE she knows something, something more she isn't saying. SNAPS her reins and they RIDE OFF: \nINT. BOX CANYON - CONTINUOUS \nAs the group gallops into a BOX CANYON, Happy starts BARKING MADLY -- the horses SLOW -- \nELLA \nSOMETHING'S WRON-- BLAMBLAN1111 GUNSHOTS from above suddenly PEPPER the ground -- the horses REAR and KICK UP, startled -- A DOZEN FIGURES ON THE CLIFFS ALL AROUND THEM. Badass OUTLAWS with RIFLES aimed at our heroes. One of them CALLS DOWN: \nOUTLAW GUNMAN \nEVERYBODY DRAW YOUR GUNS SLOW AND TOSS \n'EM ON THE GODDAMNED GROUNDI \nSHIT. SLOWLY, Jake draws his gun... tosses it. Now the rest of them. As they SEE -- TWO RIDERS -- incoming -- from the other end of the canyon. Rifles aimed and ready. Happy GROWLS... One of the outlaws knocks back the hammer on his rifle -- \nOUTLAW I say we just shoot 'em and take their-- But the words catch in his throat as his EYES WIDEN: \nOUTLAW (CONT'D) . Boss? Sure enough, they're looking right at (BRONC -JAKE. Both outlaws and HUNT) lower their guns, hostility replaced by SURPRISE: \nHUNT What the hell you doin' back here, Lonergan? Oh, Christ. This is JAKE'S gang. ON DOLARHYDE. ELLA. COLORADO. All registering it. And JAKE, of course, doesn't REMEMBER these men as Bronc dismounts, NERVOUS: \nBRONC Jesus, Boss... Creek's gonna shit when he sees you. (then; re: the others) And who the hell're they? ON JAKE. Now does he handle this? Ht:nt rides up next to him, SUSPICIOUS, and for reasons yet to be known, UNFRIENDLY -- \nSOP. DON'T DO THIS. SURPRISED looks from just about everyone in the camp (besides Colorado) as we realize Dolarhyde just spoke APA ON GREY WOLF -- INTRIGUED as he approaches Dolarhyde: \nGREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) How is it that you speak our language? \nUOLARHYUE (SUBTITLE) Because I'm a damn genius. Grey Wolf's fascinated this man has the audacity to be a WISEASS given his circumstances. Turns to the Brave with the tomahawk -- \nGREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) Forget about quick. Make him feel it. The Brave NODS, RAISES the Tomahawk again, but Dolar interrupts: \nDOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE) Two hundred head of cattle! Grey Wolf holds up his hand, halting the Brave's death blow -- \nDOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE) (CONT'D) I'll have two hundred head of cattle u_a here in a day's time if you let me go. ON GREY WOLF. Considering this. \nGREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) And how do I know you'll come back? Dolarhyde nods to Colorado -- \nDOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE) You can keep my associate here. if I don ' t come back, you can kill him. Colorado REACTS. He's the only one here who knows what the hell these two are saying to each other as Grey Wolf approaches Dolar, looks right INTO HIM -- \nGREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) Why should I believe that you even care about this man? Dolarhyde's eyes flash EMOTION. Quickly bottled. Then: \nDOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE) Because he's my son. Wow. Didn't see that one coming. Grey Wolf levels Colorado with those unyielding eyes -- \nGREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) Is this true? And Colorado answers in ENGLISH, for the benefit of the others: \nCOLORADO Yeah... he's my father. REACTIONS. JAKE. EMMETT. DOC. Stunned silence. And so: \nGREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) Three hundred head. Dolar looks to Colorado, who won't meet his eyes. His FATHER's eyes. Turns back to Grey Wolf, HARD -- \nDOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE) Two fifty. HOLD ON GREY WOLF for a beat. Then -- \nGREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) Cut him loose. The Brave does exactly that. Dolar's FREE to go... \nEMMETT Hey! What about =?!? ON DOLAR. A FLASH of regret. But it's gone fast. \nDOLARHYDE What about you, kid? And he just walks out of the camp, leaving his son behind... GONE. And now, it's back to business -- \nGREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) Kill all of them except the half-breed. Our people are GRABBED. Jake's yanked forward, PINNED DOWN -- a Brave raises a HATCHET to kill Jake, who glares back with lunatic eyes. Ready to die. Almost wanting it: \nJAKE What're you waiting for, asshole? DO IT. And as Jake's about to MEET HIS DEATH: \nFWOOM! THE PYRE SUDDENLY BILLOWS, TURNING FROM ORANGE TO GREEN \nTO WHITE -- EVERYONE BACKS AWAY AS -- \nELLA EMERGES FROM THE PYRE. WRAPPED IN A CAUL OF FIRE AND LIGHTI Except she isn't exactly Ella. She's a HUMANOID, incredibly close to us in physical appearance, her features acutely feminine, yet... ALJM. PANDEMONIUM. The Apache kneel in prostration, DROPPING weapons as flames DISSIPATE off Ella's backlit form. Her skin RETURNS to human flesh-tone. Hair too. When she finally STOPS, she looks like the ELLA we've come to know and love. STANDS there: \nELLA . what... happened? ON JAKE. Holy. SHIT. Everyone else equally STUNNED. \nEMMETT You... died. \nElla looks around. Fifty dumbstruck faces staring at her. \nELLA \n(QUIETLY; CAUGHT) . oh. OFF ELLA, who's got a helluva lot to explain -- \nINT. TEEPEE - NIGHT \nA deerskin shirt slips down over Ella's naked body.' A dark breechcloth is tied. She TURNS to us.: beautiful as ever. \nEXT. TEEPEE - NIGHT \nElla emerges to find... JAKE. Standing outside.the teepee. HARD. And for a long moment, nothing is said. Until she takes a step TOWARD him: \nELLA If I'd told you on the boat, you never would'a trusted me -- -- but he takes a step BACK. If he's relieved she's alive, he isn't showing it: \nJAKE Did you hear what I said? \n(STEPS CLOSER) Even with your memory wiped, your instincts kicked in -- \n(HIS BRACELET:) That's how it works, Jake, the bracelet reads your impulse -- you wanna fight, it reacts. Somehow you took it off one of 'em... don't you remember any of it? ON JAKE. Deeply STIRRED. As he looks down at the BRACELET and: MEMORY FLASBCUTSI REPLAY POV as we're HELD DOWN in that CAVE the TERRIFYING OCULAR PROBE lowers right in front of our eyes One of the ALIENS starts to activate the probe -- it begins to FLASH STEADILY -- HYPNOTICALLY -- PUvTNG OUR MIND -- But our arm manages to BREAK FREE -- a BLADE hidden in our sleeve -- WE SLASH OFF THE. ALIEN'S HAND -- GRAB THE BRACELET off its severed limb -- it COILS around our wrist and ACTIVATES: BLAM SLAM! We BLAST the creature to oblivion -- we're FREE! JAKE IN PRESENT -- Eyes ALIVE with MEMORY: \nJAKE I-- I blasted my way out... MEMORY FLASHCUTI REPLAY POV as we RUN through the cavern -- ESCAPE -- a LIGHT at the end of the tunnel -- BLINDING SUN hits us as we emerge -- our eyes ADJUST to see: \nThat STRANGE ROCK FORMATION HIGH ABOVE on the edge of a CANYON -- the STONE TOWER pointing to heaven -- JAKE IN PRESENT: The sequencing is COMPLETE for him now: \nJAKE (CONT'D) I remember seeing a tower... made of stone... on the rim of a canyon... Upon hearing that, Grey Wolf suddenly speaks in animated gestures, pointing North. Colorado REACTS: \nELLA What? What's he sayin'?!? Colorado turns to Jake, a flicker of HOPE: \nCOLORADO That rock you're talkin' about... he- knows where it is. \nINT. UNDERGROUND TUNNELS - NIGHT \nThe Slaver ENTERS the gloom of an UNDERGROUND CAVERN. Two ALIENS melt from the dark to greet him with frightening HISSES. SENTRIES. We HOLD on the walls as something GLITTERS: GOLD. \nINT. UNDERGROUND CAVERN - SOMEWHERE \nCLOSE ON SHERIFF TAGGART'S REFLECTION IN MURKY WATER. As we TILT UP to reveal him hanging UPSIDE DOWN. Eyes flutter open. He's seen better days. Dazed. Turns his head slightly... \nSHERIFF TAGGART You... all right...? DRIFTING over to see MARIA. Gravity PULLING her hair downward. Groggy. Mostly SCARED: \nMARIA \n(BRAVE FACE) . Fantastic. You? \nCAMERA SLOWLY TURNS, ROTATING 180 DEGREES, TO REVEAL THEY'RE STUCK TO THE CEILING OVER A WATER GROTTO. The whole town of Absolution is here... a hundred others from the now-cratered town of Winfield's Landing, feet embedded in the ORANGE RESIN. Suddenly, PERCY DOLARHYDE sees a TERRIFYING SHADOW spread across the wall -- what looks like a HUGE, COILING SNAKE: \nPERCY DOLARHYDE \nH-- HEY!!! THE HELL'S THA--?! -- but what comes around the corner is a LONG METAL TENTACLE: \nA SCANNING MECHANISM on its tip shoots out a blue triangular beam -- itemizing specimens -- SELECTING ONE: SHERIFF TAGGART. Mechanized TALONS open up -- Taggart SCREAMS as he's PLUCKED from the ceiling like an apple from a TREE: \nDEPUTY CHARLIE WADE \nKYLE!!!! ANOTHER METAL TENTACLE slithers in and GRABS WADE -- swinging our men across the cavern where we reveal... . the tentacles are attached to a TERRIFYING ALIEN MACHINE. Taggart and Wade are PINNED DOWN on what looks like an operating table. As they thrash, RESTRAINING CLAMPS enfold their skulls. An OCULAR PROBE looms _Q.Xpr. them, This is the image _ e.'_A_beM1_ seeing! This is what haRpened to him before he escaRe ! WORKER-BEE ALIENS adjusts the device over their eyes -- INSTANT X-RAYS read their retinas -- HYPNOTIC -- as the men grow DOCILE and LIMP despite their fight and -- FLASHFLASHTLASHI The probe has ERASED THEIR MINDS. Catatonic stares. Now the machine arms slip the men into separate TRANSLUCENT CAPSULES. METAL BREATHING TUBES are implanted down their throats as the capsules begin to fill with a THICK, BLUE LIQUID. This is the same blue goo -- a protective gel -- that housed the COW in that jettisoned cocoon in the desert. More Worker Bees load the cocoons into TRANSPORT SHUTTLECRAFTS. We see containment holds filled with BLEATING COWS and REARING HORSES... all going through a similar cocooning process. All of this is overseen by THE SLAVER, who stalks up a ramp behind the cocoons. The craft HUMS to life, undergear retracting as it ROARS OFF down the tunnel... \nEXT. CANYON RIM - DANN \nOur people ride up a rocky slope with a few Apaches. Grey Wolf looks around and SPEAKS, Colorado translates: \nNAT COLORADO This is Kiowa land, their sister tribe. As they near the bluff, Jake sees the STONE TOWER. Dismounts: \nJAKE That's it. As they near the bluff, they hear the growing sound of that MACHINERY. Everyone dips low, peering over to see... \nWhat looks a whole lot like a CAVALRY FORT in the canyon below, amid a network of trenches and underground tunnels. Except this fortress is made of some kind of ALIEN ALLOY, glowing impossibly bright as its steel surface reflects the rising sun. DRILLING MACHINES are chewing deep into the earth, mining for \nGOLD -- THESE ARE THE SAME DRILLS THAT LANDED IN OUR OPENING. Massive receptacles are FILLED with HUGE CHUNKS. ALIENS move in and out, working, as if from an ant hive. \nDOC Holy Jesus. Like a damn fort. Grey Wolf looks to his men, GRAVE, CRESTFALLEN as he realizes: \nGREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) The Kiowa... they were taken too. Suddenly, the ROOF of the steel structure blossoms open like a CHROME LOTUS... and WHOOSH! The SHUTTLE TRANSPORT flies out of the canyon, RISING into the dawn sky... \nELLA Transports. Way they get people and gold back and forth to the ship. \nDOC Place is crawling with those things. We'll never even get close. Grey Wolf SPEAKS -- \nNAT COLORADO He says there's a back way in... The Twin Rivers run underneath this whole canyon. Limestone tunnels up by the falls, couple miles East. Lead right down there. Jake looks to the SKY. DARK. DETERMINED. \nJAKE The Slaver... he's up in that big cloud? Ella nods, HARD. Off their SHARED DETERMINATION, our SCORE rises. A DRUM CADENCE that suggests a MISSION starting to form: \nEXT. APACHE CAMP - DAY \nELLA That's a nice thing... what you said to the boy. I didn't know better, I'd say you got yourself a sweet side. She smiles. But Jake turns to her -- deadly serious: \nJAKE There's nothin' sweet about me. I told that kid what he needed to hear so he wouldn't get in my damn way. All I care about is killin' that thing. And Ella reacts to the DARKNESS in his voice. Shakes her head: \nELLA I don't believe that. \nJAKE Well believe it. I was playing a part. (straight at her) Just like you were. He CRACKS the reins, riding ahead. HOLD ON ELLA... who finally follows as they all ride out and MUSIC SOARS: \nEXT. DESERT PLAINS - CONTINUOUS \nJAKE, ELLA, COLORADO, DOC AND THE APACHE WARRIORS RIDE LIKE HELL \nTOWARD THEIR FATE, SLAMMING RIGHT INTO LENS -- AND WE MATCH TO: \nEXT. DOLARHYDE'S RANCH - DAY \nTHUNDERING HOOVES -- but it's DOLARHYDE on his horse. REARS near the SERVANTS QUARTERS -- moving FAST toward a small hut: A HATCHET is embedded in a wood pile. Dolarhyde YANKS it out. \nINT. SERVANTS' QUARTERS - DAY \nThe APACHE WOMAN we saw in the drawn-and-quartered scene earlier is washing clothes on a basin board. She turns as -- Dolarhyde ENTERS. A menacing figure with a blade in the doorway. She stands, ALERT -- in SUBTITLED APACHE: \nTHE WOMAN (SUBTITLE) What are you doing? Without response, he levels the axe and SLAMS it down on the FLOORBOARDS. Wood chips SPRAY until a GASH is opened. Dolar REACHES in... pulling out a CANVAS BAG. A few COINS spill out... COLD. He picks them up -- looks at the woman: \nDOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE) Need it to save Nat. \nAnd now her worry becomes FEAR; English now: \nTHE WOMAN Is he okay? \nDOLARHYDE He's gonna be. A storm of mixed emotions in his eyes. That stoic Dolarhyde veneer starts to CRACK... just a hint... as the woman MOVES to him... and TOUCHES his face. And he lets her. WHOA. We realize: this woman is COLORADO'S MOTHER. Dolarhyde, for all his wicked bluster, LOVES AN APACHE. \nDOLARHYDE (CONT'D) I won't let anything happen to him, Jenny. \nTHE WOMAN \n(SOFTLY) Come back to me. With that, he's GONE with the gold. Leaving her full of DREAD. \nEXT. TWIN RIVER FALLS - CAVERN ENTRANCE - DAY \nA CASCADING WATERFALL flows over rock face into the TWIN RIVERS. The water curtain covers a CAVERN ENTRANCE. The back way in. Jake, Ella, Doc, Colorado and the Apaches cross slippery rocks and push through the water... \nINT. LIMESTONE CAVERN - CONTINUOUS \nBehind the curtain, they shake off the wet and remove TORCHES from waterproof buffalo-hide pouches. FIRELIGHT as our team creeps along in a column. TENSE. Jake glances at Colorado: \nJAKE You and Percy're brothers, huh? \nNAT COLORADO ... half. \nJAKE So... your momma and Dolarhyde--- \nNAT COLORADO We friends now? Last I checked, you shot my ear off. \nJAKE (a beat; then) Want it back? \nColorado GRUMBLES, pushes ahead of Jake... \nEXT. FORT HUACHUCA - MORNING \nA BUZZARD picks at the EAR of a DEAD GANG MEMBER. More birds scavenge the dismembered remains of JAKE'S CREW as the rest of its LIVING MEMBERS -- roughly 30 -- tend wounds and get ready to move on. One of them looks up... .. and sees an INCOMING RIDER on the horizon: \nOUTLAW \nBRONC! BRONC and HUNT look up. Draws their GUNS. So does the rest of the gang... until they see the rider's waving a WHITE FLAG. As he comes closer -- they realize it's DOLARHYDE: \nShe cranks back and the ship PITCHES upward -- \nINT. TRANSPORT SHUTTLE - OVER THE CANYON - CONTINUOUS \nThe shuttle BURSTS OUT into the canyon and skates the rim. Jake fights the G-FORCES and teeth-rattling TURBULENCE as -- The craft keeps spiralling UP UP toward... THE OMINOUS CLOUD. As we come closer, an IMPOSSIBLY BLUE GLOW blinds us: \nEXT. UPPER CLOUD LAYER - CONTINUOUS \nThe shuttle BLASTS through the upper cloud layer, to reveal... \nTHE ALIEN SCOUT -SHIP. ENORMOUS AND THREATENING, like a BLACK METAL CLAW. Cloud banks encircle the ship as if it were the eye of a hurricane. ON ELLA. Like ice down her spine... as we drift back to JAKE. Trying to find a word to DESCRIBE this thing. Finally: \nJAKE Sheee-it. \nINT. UNDERGROUND TUNNELS - CONTINUOUS \nThe rest of our heroes GALLOP FAST out the criss-crossing tunnels -- KA-CHINNNG! Apaches are CLAMPED WITH STEEL COLLARS and YANKED off their horses as the SPEEDERS roar in from behind! Colorado VEERS toward a LIGHT as Doc ignites a molotov and they: \nINT. ALIEN FORT - CANYON - CONTINUOUS \nGALLOP Out into daylight, rigb-t_through the CENTER of the fort -- Doc THROWS his molotov and BOOM!!! Aliens go FLYING, on fire! Doc throws another MOLOTOV, clearing a path for Colorado to RIDE HARD for the fort's 30 FT. STEEL ENTRY GATES... which start SWINGING CLOSED to trap them! But at the LAST SECOND, the horse SLIPS THROUGH the narrow opening as it THUNDERS CLOSED. Now the aliens are pissed off: \nEXT. ALIEN FORT - CONTINUOUS \nThey start spilling over the fort walls in pursuit. A few mount SPEEDERS and launch as our guys ride DOWN THE CANYON TRENCH: \n,INT. CANYON TRENCH - CONTINUOUS \nColorado and Doc ZIG-ZAG around CURVES -- like mice navigatinga maze, so the speeders can't get a clear shot: \nDOC They're gaining on us! \nNAT COLORADO That's the point! And just when it looks like Doc and Colorado are GONERS... BOOM! An EXPLOSION rocks the canyon as something HURTLES DOWN from above -- WHISKEY MOLOTOVS fired from the handmade CATAPULTS. BOOM! BOOM! Aliens are VAPORIZED, SHRIEKING! A cloudburst of FLAMING ARROWS brightens the sky as 20 APACHES RISE UP along the canyon rims: A AMBUSH! An ASSEMBLY LINE OF SQUAWS works like a drill team, soaking WHISKEY RAGS and wrapping arrows. Among them, EMMETT and HAPPY! The kid pocks an arrow like a damn EXPERT -- IGNITES it -- lets it FLY -- WHOOSH! It SKEWERS a speeder pilot who BURSTS INTO FLAMES, the speeder CORKSCREWS into another one, both EXPLODING: \nEMMETT \nYEAHHHHH!!! \nTHE ALIENS Caught OFF-GUARD with NO WM TO TURN AROUND as from the OPPOSITE END of the canyon, a BELLOWING WAR WHOOP: \nGREY WOLF AND HIS 40 APACHES CHARGE IN. A MOVING HUMAN WALL CRASH! The Apaches HURTLE into the flank of aliens. LASERS are met with the CRACK of RIFLES and hatchets -- \nGREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) \nTAKE THE FORT! ! ! The Apache leader spurs his horse onward, leading men toward the alien bunker. An EXPLOSION CONSUMES FRAME, becoming the: \nEXT. ALIEN SCOUT SHIP - ABOVE THE CLOUDS - CONTINUOUS \n-- PLASMA FIRE of the shuttle's burners as it ROARS toward the ALIEN SHIP... a SPECK against the BEHEMOTH: \nINT. ALIEN SCOUT SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS \nThe shuttle sweeps past the command center's polarized window, where... THE SLAVER watches with EVIL EYES. He's on the UPPER LEVEL of a TWO-TIER COMMAND CENTER. A DOZEN ALIENS operate holo-consoles. Readying the ship to leave. \nINT. TRANSPORT SHUTTLE - SAME \nElla settles down on a GLOWING DOCKING COLLAR. With the two ships CONNECTED, the DISPLAY flashes a DEPARTURE ALERT: \nELLA JAKE -- Dammit --- -- what--? \n-- WHAT'S WRQNG? -- she's CLIMBING back up the ladder, he FOLLOWS: \nINT. SHUTTLE - LADDER TUBE - CONTINUOUS \nThey quickly CLIMB up the LADDER TUBE -- \nJAKE \n(QUIETLY; HARD) Okay. And starts walking to the elevator... as a SCREAM takes us to: \nINT. CANYON - DAY \nHandmade LADDERS are SWUNG FORWARD onto the fort as Apaches try to SCALE the wall, but are BLOWN BACK by ALIEN PARAPET SENTRIES. ON DOC -- running TRIAGE on wounded warriors: \nDOC I need more bandages now!/ You: lint and splint that leg! \nGREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) We're losing ranks ! ! ! And then, out of nowhere... the BANG BANG BANG of 30 pistols fills the air as -- DOLARHYDE RIDES IN WITH JAKE'S GANG! A renewed SURGE of energy as cowboys join Indians to fortify their ranks: \nNAT COLORADO You came back! \nDOLARHYDE Told you: I take care of my kin. Colorado knows that's as close to \"I love you\" as he'll ever get. But the UPSWING is short-lived as: A speeder WHIZZES past, dropping a METALLIC BUNDLE. It splits open right in front of the fort's STEEL GATES -- pieces hydraulically ASSEMBLING THEMSELVES in seconds, becoming: THE MOTHERFUCKING SUPERGUN_OF DEATH. TWO LETHAL BARRELS spin to life, firing STRANGE STEEL BALL BEARINGS in every direction. CLAW HOOKS snap out of the balls, EMBEDDING in soldiers! One LODGES in a GANG MEMBER beside DOC -- he FLAILS: \nGANG MEMBER \nHELP ME!!! GET IT OFF! A RED SPRING-LOADED PIN depresses in the ball's center: KA-BOOM! \nSEARING WHITE LIGHT TURNS THE OFFICER TOAASH -- AN ALIEN GRENADE! Doc goes FLYING from the kickback, landing near: GREY WOLF -- FWWWWTWHCK!!! Another claw-ball CLAMPS into the Apache's SHOULDER -- he SHOUTS, struggles to pull it out -- \nDOC \nDON'T. STOP, DAMMIT!!!! The RED PIN starts to depress -- pOC LUNGES, JAMS HIS FINGER RETJff&H_THE PIN AND BLASTING CAP. Now he's stopped it from exploding, but if he pulls his finger out... HE DIES TOO. DOC and GREY WOLF lock eyes. Their fates suddenly ENTWINED as -- \nINT. SCOUT SHIP - TURBOLIFT - MOVING - CONTINUOUS \nBars of light move rhythmically across Jake's face -- BURNING with determination -- as he travels up in the turbolift. It slows to a STOP. The door cycles open and -- \n-- the STRANGEST THING happens. DESERT SAND billows in a gust of ventilated air. SAND?! Jake emerges, blocking his eyes: \nINT. SCOUT SHIP - JUNKPILE CARGO HANGAR - CONTINUOUS \n-- the sand swirls and eddies. Visibility reduced to ZERO. As Jake pushes through, the air clears a little... His eyes WIDEN. Trying to make SENSE of what he sees: Remember all those BUILDINGS that were pulled up into the tornado when Absolution was attacked? And that CRATER they found that used to be \"Winfield's Landing\"? It-'-s all-HE in a junkwle hangar. Building pieces. False front facades. Debris piled on top of each other, TILTED AND TWISTED AT FUNHOUSE ANGLES. And the desert sand that was sucked up along with it all. A GLOWING REACTOR casts hellish light on the dormant wreckage. Weapon ready, Jake moves past part of A BROTHEL. Jutting fragments of a HORSE CORRAL. A CREAKING SALOON SIGN swings like a pendulum, CLANKS EERILY. A STEAM PIPE EXPLODES STEAM. Jake WHIRLS -- and like demons... 5 ALIENS emerge. Slowly. Fanning out, taking positions as... THE SLAVER steps out of the smoke, squarely facing Jake. aAd_h@-- is holding ELLA hostage. WRIST BLASTER pressed to her throat. Jake and Ella LOCK EYES. She's terrified, but staying STRONG. His hand LINGERS at his hip, blaster ready. \nJAKE Drop the woman. We both know this ain't about her. But The Slaver only presses his blaster HARDER into Ella's neck. Almost GRINNING. And Jake MEETS the look -- \nJAKE (CONT'D) She says you're as bad as they come. Jake curls back the fingers on both hands, CRACKING knuckles: \nJAKE (CONT'D) Well, you ugly sonofabitch... they say the same about me. A pipe SPEWS STEAM -- UNNERVINGLY LOUD. Then STOPS. \nJAKE (CONT'D) Could'a had your boys kill me five times over, instead you rolled out the red carpet... so let's get it over with. \nThe Slaver HISSES ANGRILY at the challenge. PUSHES Ella roughly off to one of his GANG, who keeps a blaster pressed to her side. Vow ' O right the a ter of the \"town\" junkpile. THE SLAVER -- his hand at his side, twitching. JAKE -- his hand is still. \nA PIPE SPRAYS STEAM AGAIN, SCREAMINGLY LOUD AND -- Everyone DRAWS! But Jake's INSANELY FAST as he drops to a knee and FIRES gunsmoke-style -- BLAM SLAM! The Slaver's HIT and -- ELLA -- WRENCHES her captor's arm backward and he fires USELESS ROUNDS into the air -- she takes a HIT in the leg as Jake SHOOTS the captor with a SHOT to the temple -- Jake GRABS and PULLS Ella to safety behind a SHREDDED STORE FRONT, taking cover -- lasers PUNCHING through the building walls -- Ella spots an ALIEN lunging around a corner: \nELLA \nBEHIND YOU!!! Jake WHIRLS, SLAM!!! The creature FLIES off its feet. \nJAKE Stay down. Ella does, and here come the rest of the aliens as Jake GUNS \nTHEM ALL DOWN WITH PERFECT AIM. The REACTOR is hit in the crossfire and the ship RESPONDS with a turbine HOWL. Corpses litter the floor... all except for The Slaver. A trail of FLUORESCENT BLOOD leads around the corner... Jake WHIRLS to Ella -- her leg wounded -- \nJAKE (CONT'D) -- you alright? In PAIN, she snatches one of those SMART DISCS off a dead alien: \nELLA Reactor's hit. if I don't get this ship on the ground soon, we're all dead... (tries to STAND, WINCES) Get me over to that turbolift. He slings an arm around her shoulder and LIFTS her, helping her to the elevator -- \nELLA (CONT'D) Put me inside. He does. She sees his eyes go back to The Slaver's BLOOD TRAIL: \nELLA (CONT'D) I can manage the rest without you. (tough... but with \nCOMPASSION) Go do what you came up here to do. He looks at her. At the blood. At the unstable REACTOR. And Jake Lonergan makes a CHOICE: \nWILL YOU GET ON WITH IT?111 \nDOC AND DOLARHYDE One... two... three! And Doc RIPS the grenade from Grey Wolf's shoulder -- he HOWLS, CLAMPS tearing out of his flesh. But they did it! As more EXPLOSIONS decimate men, Dolarhyde PULLS the grenade out of Doc's hands, still holding his finger under the FIRING PIN -- \nDOC \nWHAT'RE YOU-- Dolarhyde looks at Colorado: \nDOLARHYDE Tell your mother I love her. With that, he CHARGES into the swirling chaos \nNAT COLORADO \nWAIT! -- but BOOM! Colorado's FORCED BACK by an explosion -- through the debris, he sees his father running toward... \nTHE SUPERCANNON \nDolarhyde HURLS the grenade -- BOOM!!! IT DETONATES IN A \nMILLION PIECES! DOLARHYDE DISAPPEARS IN THE BLAST! \nCOLORADO \nNO!!!!! But his sacrifice 7M S THE TIDE! THE EXPLOSION BLOWS THE \nFORT'S FRONT GATES OFF! THEY TOPPLE ON A WHOLE BUNCH OF ALIENS! A CRY OF VICTORY as the humans STORM THROUGH! Aliens hurtle back in DISORDER -- \nINT. SCOUT SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS \nThe small ALIEN BRIDGE CREW scrambles to control the damaged ship. The WHIR of the lift arriving, doors OPEN and -- WHOOSH! The SMART WEAPON blurs out of the elevator, SLICING HALF A DOZEN ALIENS IN HALF -- circles back around to ELLA, who skillfully catches it as she RUN/LIMPS from the lift with JAKE -- LASER FIRE IGNITES THE BRIDGE as he makes QUICK WORK of the rest and Ella mans a console, getting to work -- \nELLA We're going down fast. She calls up telemetry on a HOLO-WINDOW: EARTH TERRAIN -- The BATTLEFIELD. Sets coordinates, vectoring the ship that way: A WHIR as a SECOND TURBOLIFT arrives... AND THE SLAVER STEPS QQT. Wounded, and very PISSED OFF. Jake says to Ella: \nJAKE No matter what. Jake and The Slaver HURTLE into each other, TUMBLE off a catwalk, CRASHING into conduits and GUNKY WATER below. Jake staggers up but The Slaver is HUGE -- SLAMS Jake back into the water. PINS A FOOT on his blaster arm -- CRUSHING IT. Jake HOWLS as The Slaver presses a series of those HIEROGLYPH MARKINGS on Jake's BRACELET -- the symbols LIGHT UP in an UNLOCK CODE -- and KA-CHING! The bracelet POPS OF.E. The Slaver TOSSES IT into the gunky water. Draws his LASER WHIP -- WHUP-SNAP! The white-hot tip LASHES JAKE'S BACK, ripping his shirt and BURN-SCARRING HIS BACK! Jake SCREAMS in agony as The Slaver WHIPS HIM MERCILESSLY -- \nEXT. SKIES ABOVE DESERT - CONTINUOUS \nThe Scout Ship SCREAMS down out of the cloud, toward the CANYON: \nEXT. CANYON BATTLEFIELD - CONTINUOUS \nOutlaws and Apaches finish off the wounded, TOMAHAWKS RIPPING AWAY TENTACLED SCALPS! Carnage and joy -- but then: A MONSTROUS SHADOW spreads over the battlefield. Everyone looks up to see the SCOUT SHIP PLUMMETING DOWN -- \nGREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) Fall back!!! NOW!! NOW!! \nINT. SCOUT SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - LOWER LEVEL - CONTINUOUS \nAnother LASER WHIP SNAP and Jake seems DONE. Now The Slaver LIFTS Jake from the water, CRUSHING his wind-pipe. Jake FLAILS, REACHING for something BELOW FRAME... finally GRABS and STABS it into The Slaver's side. The Alien ROARS in pain and looks down to see -- \nONE OF HIS OWN \"ICE TACKS\" FROM HIS BANDOLIER EMBEDDED IN HIS \nSIDE. IT STARTS TO GLOW BLUE WITH A HIGH-PITCH WHINE: \nJAKE Go to hell. \nTHE SLAVER'S ROAR OF DEFEAT IS CUT SHORT AS THE MOTHERFUCKER \nFREEZES TO GREY STONE. EXPLODING IN A MILLION PIECES!!! Jake DROPS, GASPING. Revenge fulfilled. Painfully starts CLIMBING a ladder back to the upper deck -- \nEXT. CANYON - BATTLEFIELD - CONTINUOUS \nAs the humans FLEE from the fort, the remaining aliens RETREAT to the last shuttles for ESCAPE... start to LIFT OFF... But find themselves SMASHING into the ENORMOUS HULL of the ship as_it crashe _down! \nINT. SCOUT SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS \nJake FALLS into the seat beside Ella, straps in. Fighting the controls, she SEES THE WHIP MARKS on his back. It TEARS her heart open. And because this might be the end... she ADMITS: \nELLA We didn't get all of 'em. Some ran oft. That LANDS on Jake, as he too looks toward the endless horizon. HOLD on them, together, a VICTORIOUS but UNRESOLVED note... We RISE UP over the sea of bodies and the CRASHED SHIP, until Jake and Ella are just two small figures in the crowd... \nFADE TO: \nEXT. TOWN OF ABSOLUTION - DAY \nA glorious sight: Absolution in REBIRTH -- FLUSH from all that GOLD. Storefronts brightly painted, the streets ALIVE. We PICK UP EMMETT running through the hustle and bustle with two APACHE KIDS. Suddenly, DOLARHYDE, COLORADO and their gang ride in. SHERIFF TAGGART emerges from his office with DEPUTY WADE: \nSHERIFF TAGGART \nEMMETT! GET OVER HERE!!! \nEMMETT -- what? What'd I dQ? \nSHERIFF TAGGART EMMETT Get outta the road before you're run down! If your (overlapping) momma saw y-- -- \"saw me playin' in the street she'd roll over in her grave and shoot lightnin' bolts outta her eyes,\" I know, I know! He runs off. Taggart SMIRKS: \nSHERIFF TAGGART Kid's got a mouth on him. \nDEPUTY WADE Well, Kyle, considering he saved your life, guess you'll just have to grin'n bear it. Dolar moves up to Taggart, tough as ever. The men HOLD looks: \nSHERIFF TAGGART Woodrow. \nDOLARHYDE Kyle. Percy STEWS about something. Dolar WHACKS him upside the head: \nDOLARHYDE (CONT'D) Go_ _on. Grudgingly, Percy hands Taggart a SHEAF OF PAPER -- \nSHERIFF TAGGART What's this? \nDOLARHYDE Claims to the land 50 miles west of here. I've signed it over to the township of Absolution. (off Taggart's LOOK) Considering I'm a businessman, I figure expansion's in both our interests. Needs the Sheriff's signature to be official. \nSHERIFF TAGGART Fifty miles west of here is where the goldmine is, Woodrow. \nDOLARHYDE \n(A BEAT) That so. With surprise, Taggart studies the paper. SMILES: \nSHERIFF TAGGART What's this about twenty percent going to the Apaches? Dolarhyde glances at Colorado. A moment. But the hardened rancher maintains his rock-solid facade: \nDOLARHYDE Figure the only way not to piss 'em off is to buy 'em. \nSHERIFF TAGGART Since when'd you worry about pissin' anyone off? \nDOLARHYDE Just sign it, Goddamnit. With a grin, Taggart gestures for Deputy Wade to turn around and flattens the paper on his BACK, using it as a surface to SIGN: \nSHERIFF TAGGART I'd say you were being generous, Woodrow, but I know you'd just be insulted. \nDOLARHYDE Damn right. Dolar gives his hat a TIP, then mounts up to go -- and we RISE UP to the UPPER FLOOR of the GOLD LEAF SALOON, in the process of being rebuilt in grand style -- and MOVE IN on a WINDOW where: \nINT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nDOC AND MARIA burst through a door, tearing passionately at each other's CLOTHES -- Maria MOANS as Doc kisses her neck: \nDOC MARIA SHH! The workers will hear us!!! Let them hear! As they TUMBLE back onto the bed, Doc LURCHES. Reaches under his back to find... a GOLD POCKETWATCH. \nDOC What is this? \nMARIA Look at the inscription. He flips it open to find an ENGRAVING: \"MI CORAZON... POR SIEMPRE.\" Doc looks up at her, MOVED. Then -- PLAYFULLY: \nDOC This looks like Aldo Mayberry's watch... \nMARIA Shut up and kiss me. She pulls him down, OUT OF FRAME -- \nEXT. EDGE OF TOWN - DAY \nA hand unties a HORSE from its tether bar -- it's JAKE. Saddle bags packed. A BARK turns him around... HAPPY. Yipping for Jake to FOLLOW. He GRINS.

Thunder blends with DRUMS as we reach a BOX CANYON... \nA BONFIRE -- SILHOUETTED BODIES -- APACHE WARRIORS Whirling around the fire -- war paint -- masks and headdresses -- a RELIGIOUS RITE or CELEBRATION. On the periphery, we FIND... A BEAUTIFUL APACHE WOMAN. Softly singing to the even more beautiful BABY in her arms as we FOLLOW THEM INTO -- A TEEPEE. The simple melody of the woman's song as she lays the baby on a blanket, gently swaddling it, LOVE in her eyes. But. The wind starts to HOWL. QRAJ. And then... a BURST OF LIGHT through the opening of the teepee -- intense ULTRAVIOLET: FWHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSHHss!!! \nTHE E IRE TENT IS RIPPED UP INTO THE SKY, LEAVING THE WOMAN AND HER BABY-EXPOSED!!!! She SCREAMS -- grabs her child and starts to RUN -- CHAOS EVERYWHERE as the tribe scatters in TERROR -- Suddenly -- Apaches are getting YANKED INTO THE AIR by some superior force -- PLUCKED savagely into the light, GONE -- as we WHIP AROUND the horror show of SCREAMING, DISAPPEARING INDIANS -- And now -- A DEAFENING SHRIEK AS STRANGE DOMED OBJECTS HURTLE \nDOWN, CRASHING LIKE COMETS TO THE CANYON FLOOR AND CRUSHING \nFLEEING PEOPLE.

ARIZONA DESERT - DAY \nburning sun FLARES LENS, beating down on... A MAN. Lying in the barren DESERT. Out cold. Handsome... but HARD. We'll call him THE MAN IN BLACK, the color of his dirty clothes. \nA PINK TONGUE LICKS HIM. The man STARTS AWAKE -- to find a MONGREL DOG over him. Mangy. But sweet. COUGHING, the man stumbles up. How'd he get here? And where the hell i.: here? And -- OWWW. A GASH in his side... .. part of the wound oddly SEARED. He winces. Trying to solve this painful puzzle. Something GLINTS on his wrist: A STEEL BRACELET. No clasp to pull it off. He touches the surface -- TSSS -- SHIT -- It's HOT! And there's a BLACK STETSON on the ground. The Man grabs it to shield his eyes... but STOFS: A WORN PHOTOGRAPH in the inner brim. A WOMAN. Young, beautiful. SMILING. The Man stares: does he KNOW this woman? is this even HIS hat? The dog BARKS ALERT. The man turns -- QUICK -- his hand reaches toward his hip on INSTINCT but there's no holster. NO GUNS. \nTHREE RIDERS ON HORSEBACK ARE COMING OVER THE RISE: THE CLAIBORNE BROTHERS -- WES, MOSE and LUKE. Dusty and tough. Wes gallops right up to our Man, gives him the once over -- \nWES CLAIBORNE Howdy. \n(NO RESPONSE) We're riding towards Absolution. You know how far west we are? The Man's got NO IDEA what he's talking about. \nLUKE CLAIBORNE Maybe he's a dummy. Wes hops off his horse, right in The Man's face now -- \nWES CLAIBORNE There a reason you don't wanna answer my question, friend? And now, Mose nods to the BRACELET on The Man's wrist -- \nMOSE CLAIBORNE Wes, he's got iron on his wrist... and he's been shot. \nLUKE CLAIBORNE Bet he's a chain jumper. Luke spurs his horse behind him -- The Man's SURROUNDED. \nLUKE If he escaped, there'll be a bounty. Let's bring him with us. Wes nods as he slides a SAWED-OFF DOUBLE-BARREL from his back scabbard. COCKS both barrels. The dog GROWLS -- \nWES CLAIBORNE Not your lucky day, Stranger -- turn round and start walking. But The Man doesn't move. The Claibornes share glances. Wes steps forward -- RAISING HIS RIFLE -- \nWES CLAIBORNE (CONT'D) Dead or alive, no difference. I said \nWALK OR-- THE MAN MOVES, A MECHANISM OF BRUTAL VIOLENCE -- YANKS the rifle forward as BLAMI -- shot goes WILD -- suddenly the gun's in THE MAN'S HANDS -- BLAXI Wes is BLOWN backwards, HOLE IN HIS CHEST! As Hose draws his Enfield, The Man FLIPS the rifle again -- SLAM! MOSE FLIES OFF HIS SADDLE as The Man rolls -- UNDER Luke's horse -- GRABBING Luke's ankle -- suddenly Luke's FLAT on his back -- BREATHLESS, staring UP at the double-barrel: \nLUKE CLAIBORNE -- P-please, God -- d-don't -- -- The Man PULLS the trigger but CLICK! The rifle's EMPTY. Luke's RELIEF is short as The Man SLAMS the gun-butt down, knocking him out cold. And ALL of this took about ten seconds. This man is a cold-blooded KILLER. But somehow... he didn't seem to KNOW that. CONFUSION. Drops the rifle, looks down at his hands... covered in BLOOD. And the BODIES in his wake. The WIND loosens a piece of PAPER from Wes's jacket. It DANCES on the breeze -- flattens against The Stranger's foot. He picks it up, BLOODY FINGERPRINTS on what we now see is a TELEGRAM -- \n\"TO FORT STANTON -- STOP -- ABSOLUTION TOWNSHIP BESIEGED BY \nOUTLAWS -- STOP -- FIFTY DOLLARS FOR ANY MAN WITH A GUN -- STOP \n-- ABSOLUTION AWAITS -- STOP\" \nTHE MAN IN BLACK (a hoarse whisper) Absolution... \nSLAM TO MOMENTS LATER: With a HYA! The Man sends two horses GALLOPING, mounts the third, wincing at that gash in his side. Starts to trot off... sees the dog following... \nTHE MAN IN BLACK (CONT'D) Get outta here. Leave me alone. But the dog keeps following. Like they're FRIENDS now. The man turns away dismissively as we BOOM UP to reveal the WIDE OPEN VALLEY below... and a SPECK within it that is: \nEXT. TOWN - MAIN STREET - DAY \nA CROOKED SIGN: \"ABSOLUTION.\" The town is dismal and forgotten. Crumbling buildings blistered by sun. The Man rides in -- dehydrated, the wound DRAINING him.

The dog sits by the door as The Man enters -- EMPTY -- he's moving -- into a small kitchen area -- bottle of whiskey -- uncorks it with his teeth -- drinks -- pours some on the wound -- then A PISTOL COCKS behind him -- Meet MEACHAM, town preacher, a tough, wash-foot Baptist: \nMEACHAM Palms to heaven, Friend. The Man freezes. Turns up his hands. \nTHE MAN IN BLACK Been shot. \nMEACHAM Only two kinds of men get shot -- criminals and victims. (steps forward; hard) Which one're you? \nTHE MAN IN BLACK don't know. Meacham hears the HONESTY in his voice. Knows a lost soul when he sees one. Lowers his gun, softening... \nMEACHAM Got a name, son? \nTHE MAN IN BLACK Don't know that either. \nMEACHAM What do you know? \nTHE MAN IN BLACK (a beat; then) ... English. Off Meacham, INTRIGUED -- we CUT TO: \nINT. CHURCH RECTORY - LATER \nA CANDLE FLAME -- a NEEDLE passing through it -- it's LATER and Meacham's studying The Man's wound: \nMEACHAM Odd wound. Looks... cauterized. (off The Man's look) Means somethin' burned it half closed. The Man just stares. News to him. And now, as Meacham leans over the wound, the METAL CROSS around his neck begins to twitch... lifting ever so SLIGHTLX off his chest -- towards the strange BRACELET on the Man's wrist. Meacham reacts -- \nMEACHAM (CONT'D) Nice trick. That some kinds... magnet? The Man looks at him -- \"What the hell is a 'magnet'?!?\" Meacham shrugs it off, readies the needle -- \nMEACHAM (CONT'D) Try'n hold still. He pokes the hot needle through the wound -- The Man winces slightly, but bears the pain. \nMEACHAM (CONT'D) Where'd you ride in from? \nTHE MAN IN BLACK West. Woke up in the desert. Looking up at the sun like I'd been dropped outta the sky. \nMEACHAM Seems I remember a story about that happening once... fella by the name of Lucifer. \n(GRINS) How 'bout I just call you \"Luke,\" for short. But TheMan's distracted by his REFLECTION in a cracked mirror: his own face unfamiliar. Meacham nods towards The Man's HANDS -- \nMEACHAM (CONT'D) That blood yours or somebody else's? \nTHE MAN IN BLACK Three men rode up. Drew on me. \n(STILL CONFUSED) My hands... moved on their own. \nMEACHAM \n(A BEAT) Anything else you wanna confess to while you got my attention? And The Man senses somehow that, ygg, there is... but: \nTHE MAN IN BLACK Everything that happened before I woke up... (shakes his head) It's gone. \nMEACHAM Well. Too bad. Can't absolve you for your sins if you don't recall 'em. That bein' said... Meacham looks up, eyes twinkling. This is not a fire n' brimstone preacher. This is a guy who GETS IT -- \nMEACHAM (CONT'D) I seen bad men do good things and good men do bad things. Whether you end up in heaven or hell... it's not God's plan... it's yours. \n(BEAT) You just got to remember what it was. The Man considers. Darkly -- \nTHE MAN IN BLACK What if I don't want to remember? \nMEACHAM \n(BEAT; GRINS) Then you're probl'y goin' to hell. On cue -- SMASH!!! The stained glass window EXPLODES as a MOLOTOV COCKTAIL hurtles into the church. FIRE spreads around the pews -- MEACHAM ACTIVATES -- tears curtains off the confessional and uses them to STAMP OUT the fire -- \nMEACHAM (CONT'D) Dammit -- it's Dolarhyde's men!

Hunt reluctantly scrambles over to Jake, oh-so-carefully pulls the PISTOL from Jake's holster: \nHUNT Sorry, Boss... nothin' personal.

Creek's next PUNCH takes us to another: TORY FLASECUTI REPLAY -- Jake and Alice in the cabin -- he drops the SADDLEBAG -- it CLINKS to the floor. She's worried: \nALICE Your boys'ii come after you. \nJAKE (dark, determined) Let 'em come. BACK TO PRESENT -- as now Jake UNDERSTANDS the context of this moment -- what they were saying to each other -- He looks up at Creek, BEATEN AND BUSTED UP: \nJAKE (CONT'D) Okay... okay, I remember now... (\"fuck you\" grin) Demons stole your gold, Creek. But when you get to hell, you can ask for it back. \nCREEK JOHNSON \n(TSK'S) Okay then. That's the way you wanna do this... \n(TURNS) Kill the whore. ON THE GANG. As they all cock their guns -- Aimed at Ella -- This is IT -- JAKE -- slowly lifts his head, suddenly RAGE-FILLED as -- \nHIS WRIST BRACELET ACTIVATES! BLAMMMM11! A SEARING PULSE BLAST \nFIRES, VAPORIZING CREEK JUST BEFORE HE PULLS THE TRIGGER! EVERYONE'S FACES. Holy shit. Jake spits on the around between the SMOKING BOOTS that formerly belonged to Creek: \nJAKE Told you not to call her that. ON JAKE. Pure KILLER. As he turns his weapon on the rest of the (awestruck) gang -- through BLOODY TEETH: \nJAKE (CONT'D) You're all riding with me. Any one of you decides otherwise? So help me God, I'll kill you where you stand. \n(AND THEN) I'm j2acj& and I'M in goddamne.d The gang quickly flips: \"Absolutely, Jake/ Whatever you say, Boss...\" Jake turns to the speechless Bull McCade and KICKS HIM IN THE BALLS as hard as he can, doubling him over. Now he meets eyes with ELLA. She can't help SMIRKING, grateful. DOC. Is the only one NOT looking at Jake. His attention drawn toward a SOUND coming from the distant DUNES -- \n", "test2_true": "A SPEEDER IS ROARING TOWARD THEM BOUNCING OVER DESERT: \nDOLARHYDE (squints, realizing...) Jesus... it's the kid. As Emmett ROARS IN, the shocked outlaws SCATTER: \nEMMETT \nTHEY'RE COMING!!!! THEY'RE COMING!!! The kid TUMBLES off the speeder as it PLOWS RIGHT THROUGH CAMP, kicking up DIRT and UPENDING SUPPLIES. As Emmett scrambles up -- \nVROOOM! FOUR MORE SPEEDERS ROAR OVER THE CREST IN PURSUIT OF \nEMMETT! THE ALIENS FROM THE CAVE! \nJAKE \nEVERYBODY MOOOOVE!!! \nSTEEL COLLARS START FLYING, ATTACHED TO ROPING CABLES -- BEFORE \nTHE GANG KNOWS WHAT'S HAPPENING, THEY'RE BEING GRABBED AND \nDRAGGED AWAY! Those who have their wits about them FIRE BACK, trying to hit the flying machines. CROSSFIRE. CONFUSION. \nTHE SLAVER His speeder GROWLS to a halt. Dismounting like a killer biker. ON JAKE. As he SEES that horrible alien face across the crowd: QUICK BIT: Alice dying in his arms. And this same damn THING is the one responsible for it. And we're: BACK TO PRESENT. Jake's eyes LOCKED on the SLAVER as he says: \nJAKE (CONT'D) You. \nBUT THE ACTION COMES ROARING BACK AS: Outlaws start FIRING at the Slaver, who REACTS in mere annoyance. Flicks open a POUCH on his bandolier for what look like THUMB TACKS -- throws them and they tan out, PIERCING THE NECKS of the outlaws, activating \"Blue\": !NTLY E ZE. TUR an The Slaver draws a ROL) that TELESCOPES into a SIX FOOT LANCE -- KA-TCHING! BARBED ENDS snap out and the alien runs on two limbs, then FOUR -- LEOPARD-LIKE for speed -- rises back up and SMASH! SHATTERS each man into a million Pieces. Now he uses the bladed-ends to SKEWER five more outlaws and turns -- \nMEETING JAKE'S EYES IN MUTUAL RECOGNITION -- SCREECHES: \nJAKE (CONT'D) \n(TO DOLARHYDE) Find cover!!! Jake FIRES his pulse blaster, providing cover as DOLAR, DOC, EMMETT, and ELLA rush to hide behind the WAGON. The Aliens FIRE BACK as LASER CROSSFIRE shreds the camp -- EXPLOSIONS and CHAOS: THREE OUTLAWS scramble to form a GATLING CREW. It SPINS to life, MOWING DOWN tents as they try to hit the aliens -- \nANOTHER ALIEN Hurls a boomerang-like \"SMART WEAPON.\" It circles past the GATLING COWBOYS, BACK into the alien's hand as: \nTHE TOP HALVES OFTHE_COWBOYS SLIDE OFF, SEVERED AT THE WAIST,'. An EXPLOSION blows one of whiskey crates open on the wagon: \nEMMETT \nUSE THE WHISKEY! IT BURNS EM! \nELLA \n-- WHAT?! \nEMMETT \nLIKE ACID ON THEIR SKIN!!! Ella REACTS -- WHAT? As an alien SKITTERS toward her, she grabs a bottle and HURLS IT -- it EXPLODES all over the creature! A HORRIBLE SCREECH as its skin smokes, thrashing epileptically -- \nELLA \n(REVELATION) Oh my GOD -- \nDOLARHYDE \nLET'S GO!!! Our people ESCAPE for the horses. Doc climbs up on the WAGON buckboard and pulls EMMETT in the seat beside him -- As ELLA leaps on a horse -- \nTHE SLAVER Climbs back on his speeder and GUNS FOR HER, firing a STEEL COLLAR -- Jake turns -- SEES THIS. Starts RUNNING MADLY: \nJAKE \nELLA!! \n", "test3_input": "Too late: KA-CHANK! The collar CLAMPS her neck, RIPPING ELLA OFF HER HORSE! The CABLE snaps back and attaches to the hovercraft as it ZIPS by, DRAGGING ELLA BACKWARD LIKE A WATER \nSKIER BEHIND A SPEEDBOAT! ON JAKE -- FURY -- HIS BRACELET ACTIVATES! And there's a LOGIC here we'll come to realize, as he KICKS his horse into a gallop: \nJAKE (CONT'D) \nHYAA! \nEXT. DESERT - CONTINUOUS \nELLA'S DRAGGED BEHIND THE SPEEDER. Hands GRASPING at the magnetic collar as it HALF-CHOKES HER, yet keeps her upper body SUSPENDED just oft the ground while her heels BOUNCE HARSHLY -- \nJAKE ON THE HORSE Riding hard -- aims his BLASTER, trying to get a TARGET on the CABLE linking Ella's collar to the speeder -- fires -- MISSES! The Slaver TILTS VERTICAL to fly through a narrow CANYON ENTRANCE as Ella's fingers reach wildly for THE BOWIE KNIFE on her belt. She starts CUTTING THE CABLE, trying to FREE HERSELF: WHOOSH! The speeder BLASTS out the other side of the canyon, Jake still in pursuit but suddenly... \nTHE UNION PACIFIC LOCOMOTIVE IS CURVING AROUND A CORNER, RACING RIGHT FOR THEM! This is the train Jake's gang was gonna rob! \nINT. UNION PACIFIC EXPRESS CAR - CONTINUOUS \nTwo PINKERTONS sit by a SAFE. LOOK UP at an unidentified ROAR -- \nPINKERTON #1 You hear.that? \nPINKERTON #2 How many times I gotta tell you, Leonard. No one'd be stupid enough to rob this tr-- \nSWWWWWM. IN THE WINDOW BEHIND THEM... THE SPEEDER BLASTS BY. \nGOING AGAINST THE TRAIN, ELLA BOUNCING BEHIND IT. When the Pinkertons SNAP around, Ella's GONE... but now they SEE JAKE -- ON HORSEBACK -- FLASHING PAST in pursuit! \nPINKERTON #2 (CONT'D) 1 stand corrected. They DRAW GUNS, running to see what's happening and -- \nEXT. UNION PACIFIC TRAIN - KID AIR AT 80 MPH - CONTINUOUS \nAs the speeder SKIMS alongside the train, ELLA keeps struggling painfully to CUT HER COLLAR CABLE. Jake FIRES again, MISSES the cable but DETONATES THE SIDE OF A TRAIN CAR: \nINT. UNION PACIFIC - TRAIN CAR - CONTINUOUS \nThe wall EXPLODES INWARD on the Pinkertons -- hurt, but ALIVE -- \nEXT. UNION PACIFIC TRAIN - CONTINUOUS \nThe speeder's SHAKEN. The Slaver GROWLS as he fights for balance. Reaches the TRAIN'S END, skims past the caboose and -- \nDAMNIT. THE SLAVER ARCS BACK AROUND IN A WIDE U-TURN, SLOTTING \nIN FOR COVER BEHIND THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TMIN\u00e2\u0080\u00a2,=_`T1.2AVF.LLING,.J \nTHE SAME DIRECTION NOW! \nELLA'S FLUNG WILDLY BY THE HAIRPIN TURN! SHE DROPS THE KNIFE, \nIT CLATTERS AWAY! HER ONLY MEANS OF ESCAPE GONE! \nJAKE'S POV: Through a slot between boxcars, the speeder BLURS in the opposite direction. Up ahead comes the CABOOSE. No more TRAIN: Thinking FAST, Jake LEAPS off his horse -- CATCHES A LADDER RUNG ON THE CABOOSE'. Teeth gritted, starts to CLIMB up onto: \nEXT. TOP OF UNION PACIFIC TRAIN CAR - CONTINUOUS \nJake JUMPS from car to car -- over LOGS in a TENDER CAR -- BLAM BLAM!!! The PINKERTONS are climbing to the roof, WEAPONS FIRING -- Jake loses footing, ROLLING off the side -- \nEXT. SIDE OF TRAIN - CONTINUOUS \n-- but CATCHES another ladder rung and he DANGLES, looks DOWN: \nELLA IS RIGHT UNDER HIM, DRAGGING BEHIND THE SPEEDER! HE \nREACHES OUT -- \n", "test3_true": "TAKE MY HAND! She GRUNTS WITH EXERTION as their fingers GRAZE each other and The Slaver SNAPS AROUND. Hurls a SMART DISC at Jake -- no choice, he LETS GO of the LADDER -- HITS the ground PAINFULLY \nTHE PINKERTONS RUSH TO THE ROOF EDGE -- SXLSKLISH! The disc VIVISECTS THEM THEN CIRCLES BACK AROUND, cutting the IRON STRAPS that secure the logs in the tender car -- \nTHE LOGS START ROLLING OFF THE TOP. CRASHING DOWN ON THE SPEEDER. It SPIRALS end-over-end, CRASHING into the desert! ON JAKE. He picks himself up, WINCING. Sees the SMOKING WRECK in the distance. Starts to limp, then RUN -- \nEXT. CRASHED SPEEDER - CONTINUOUS \nJake APPEARS through the smoke. No sign of The Slaver. Then -- FALLING ROCKS turns his look upward. Though WOUNDED, the alien is SCALING a rock-face. Turns... a look that says \"Next time.\" Then in a BLUR, it's GONE. Jake's blaster REVERTS into a bracelet. When the smoke clears: ELLA is revealed on the ground, thrown from the speeder. Jake REACTS -- EQ -- takes her in his arms. She desperately tries to SAY SOMETHING... but goes LIMP. \nJAKE Ella...? Her head just falls back. Yeah. Hard to swallow, but it's true. ELLA'S DEAD. And if this moment ECHOES Jake holding his dead wife, well that's just fine. He stares beseechingly as... HOOFBEATS. The rest of our people gallop in: Colorado, Dolarhyde, Doc and Emmett in the wagon: \nEMMETT Aw no... is she --? Jake looks up -- unhinged -- \nNAT COLORADO We need to get out of here NOT. \nJAKE NAT COLORADO Not gonna leave her here -- L4Re.Xam -- -- I'M NOT LEAVIN' HER! -- This is Apache territory! They catch us, they'll kill u-- THHHHHHHUNKI The air SCREAMS as an ARROW pierces the ground inches from Jake's hand! Suddenly THIRTY MORE -- ALL AROUND THEM -- forming an instant circle perimeter as -- APACHE WARRIORS FLASH DOWNHILL. Dolar dismounts, swings Emmett to the ground -- \nNAT COLORADO (CONT'D) Nobody move. Jake and Emmett freeze. The Apaches are ALL AROUND THEM. Fierce. BOWS and TOMAHAWKS drawn -- OFF THIS: \nEXT. ARIZONA MOUNTAINS - TWILIGHT \nThe sun DIPS behind the mountains... NIGHT FALLS... \nINT. TEEPEE - NIGHT \nCLOSE ON ELLA'S DEAD FACE. Still. Beautiful. FIND JAKE, on his knees beside her, hands bound in front of him. An INDIAN WOMAN finishes wrapping the body in a shroud and LEAVES. Jake is alone. Overwhelmed. Raw. Something rising in him. Something he COULDN'T FACE... until this moment:. \nJAKE I remember now. \n(THEN; SOFTLY) I-- I did love her. And just saying it, saying those words, brings a swell of EMOTION to the surface... but he FIGHTS it. A losing battle, as his eyes WELL: \nJAKE (CONT'D) She was like you. Seemed to think I was a good man. (finally, voice almost \nCRACKS) But I couldn't save either of you. A beat... his bound hands gently touch her face... \nJAKE (CONT' D ) Where's the good in that? His eyes CLOSE. Too much. \nJAKE (CONT'D) I'm sorry, Ella. And that sits... then suddenly -- JARRINGLY -- THREE MORE BRAVES roughly enter, pull Jake up, FORCE HIM out: \nEXT. APACHE ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT \nBAN! Our people are THROWN TO THEIR KNEES in a large CIRCLE OF APACHES. GUARDED by warriors with tomahawks and -- WHOOSH! A PYRE is ignited and if we ever had any doubt about Ella being dead, the BRAVES carry her roughly past -- \nJAKE \nHEY! GODDAMMIT DON'T YOU TOUCH-- -- he's YANKED BACK and held in place as... ELLAIg BODY IS THROWN RIGHT INTO THE FLAMES. Jake helplessly watches her BURN. \nEMMETT Wasn't your fault, Mr. Lonergan. Those things... were lookin' for her. Had a picture and everything. That breaks the spell. Jake looks over -- \nJAKE What d'you mean... 'a picture'? \nEMMETT Floatin', like that arrow thing we found in its eye. Before Jake can makes sense of this, a teepee smoke flap OPENS and out steps the tribe's SACHEM. This is GREY WOLF -- dark, wrinkled face enhanced by TATTOOS. He takes one look at his prisoners and SPEAKS A FEW WORDS OF APACHE. \nDOC What'd he say? \nCOLORADO \"Kill them. And make it quick.\" Doc is amply freaked. Turns to Jake as FIVE OF THE BRAVES move for them, MENACING -- \nDOC Now'd be a good time to use your gun bracelet, my friend. But Jake is VACANT. BROKEN. All the fight seems GONE from him. His bracelet DOESN'T MOVE. Dolarhyde's grabbed first... PULLED FORWARD by one of the braves, raising his TOMAHAWK -- they're really gonna KILL HIM -- \nDOLARRYDE \n(SUBTITLED) \n"}

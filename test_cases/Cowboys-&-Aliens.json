Then -- \nTHE MAN IN BLACK . Luke. \nSHERIFF TAGGART Well I'm in your debt, Luke. Tune of fifty dollars, actually. (off The Man's look) Our advert? The telegram? The Man NODS -- Oh, RIGHT. \nSHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D) Could use a man like you in case any of 'em come back... \nTHE MAN IN BLACK -- I'm just passing through. \nSHERIFF TAGGART Fair enough. You don't mind spending the night, bank opens in the morning... I'll get you your money then. (nods down the street) Saloon's got rooms. You just tell Maria I sent you. The Man tips his hat, nods to Emmett (still STARSTRUCK), turns to go. Taggart furrows his brow as the DOG scampers after him. \nSHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D) You here with the prospector woman? The Man stops. Intrigued. Turns back -- \nTHE MAN IN BLACK woman? \nSHERIFF TAGGART Yup. Real looker. Came into town yesterday with that there dog. She a friend of yours? \nON THE MAN.

One's drinking liberally from a BOTTLE; call him ROY CLANTON. The other two trade glances, nervous: \nRANCH HAND #1 Should take it easy there, Pal -- \nRANCH HAND #2 Mr. Dolarhyde don't like it when we drink on the job. \nROY CLANTON I don't give a damn what he don't like -- gotta sit here and babysit a damn herd of cattle. Dolarhyde ain't gonna do squat. (rises; grabs his \nCROTCH) Gotta see a man about a buffalo... He lets out a big BURP and stumbles off behind a ridge. More THUNDER. Something doesn't feel right. A sudden WHOOSH and -- \nA COW'S PULLED INTO THE AIR BEHIND THEM BY SOME INVISIBLE FORCE, JUST LIKE THE APACHES IN OUR OPENING! Flies STRAIGHT UP, out of FRAME. Its PLAINTIVE MOO blending into all the others: \nRANCH HAND #1 You hear that? \nRANCH HAND #2 Hear what? \nANOTHER COW zips up from the herd behind them. And ANOTHER. MANY OF THE SWSSHS.

PULL BACK... he's ALL THAT'S LEFT in the open range. \nINT. GOLD LEAF SALOON - NIGHT \nTHE BATWING DOORS SWING OPEN: The Man In Black enters with the dog, tips his hat to a couple WHORES. They GRIN, liking what they see. RANCH HANDS drink their pay. Behind the bar, a MAN and WOMAN argue. DOC and MARIA; she's a buxom Mexican beauty; he's 300 roly-poly pounds of ANXIOUS CASTILIAN JEALOUSY: \nDOC -- I know you are, don't lie to me! \nMARIA How many times do we have to do this, Arturo? J. love you. \nDOC Really? Do you?!? (holds up a POCKETWATCH) I found this in our bed! And I don't k3 Vg. a watch, Maria. I can't AfjQrd a watch because y insisted we buy this saloon! She looks at him SQUARELY -- yes, some SECRET withheld. As The Man In Black reaches the bar, he's Maria's EXCUSE to end this: \nMARIA We have customers. And MOVES off. Doc stomps toward the exit -- sees EMMETT at the back of the bar stealing sips of BEER from left-behind glasses: \nDOC \nAFUERA! ADULTS ONLY!!! Emmett RUNS OUT. The Man sits beside an old cuss named ATTICUS. The dog heels at The Man's feet, eyes a STEAK on Atticus' plate: \nATTICUS That mutt makes a move for my steak, I'll drill him down. \nMARIA Shut up, Atticus. This is the man who took out Percy Dolarhyde. Atticus grumbles and goes back to eating, but not before sweeping his duster aside to show the GUN in his holster. Maria rolls her eyes, sets a GLASS in front of The Man, who nods: \nTHE MAN IN BLACK I'm looking for a woman. She gestures to the WHORES -- \nMARIA What kind? \nTHE MAN IN BLACK This kind. He removes the PHOTO from inside his hat. The one of the WOMAN. \nMARIA Never seen her before. But she is beautiful. (pours him whiskey; then one for herself) Here's to you finding her, Senor. ON THE MAN. Not exactly sure he WANTS to. But they CLINK glasses, knock 'em back. Maria pours him another: \nMARIA (CONT'D) You have any idea what kind of mess you just stepped into? \nTHE MAN IN BLACK No. But I figured I'd be safe in here seein' as how that boy I tossed off his horse didn't wanna burn your saloon. Maria's eyes go down. Somehow GUILTY. But then: \nMARIA It's not the boy you should worry about. \n(OMINOUS) It's his papa. \nEXT. RANCH - NIGHT \nPOV: UPSIDE DOWN, A MAN, surrounded by his RANCH HANDS -- his FACE just out of the light, hat brim lowered under an oil lamp: \nDOLARHYDE Name's Woodrow Dolarhyde. I'm what you might call, the Tall Hog at the trough. \nHis face comes INTO light: 50's, tailored finery, patent leather Wellington boots that bespeak wealth. HARD. Exudes POWER: \nDOLARHYDE (CONT'D) You're Roy, right? Clanton, is it? Been working for me two weeks now, and I haven't had the pleasure. Our POV belongs to ROY CLANTON, the ranch hand from the cow abductions. TERRIFIED -- his arms and legs TIED TO THE SADDLES OF TWO HORSES, kicking dirt in front of Dolarhyde's RANCH HOUSE: \nCLANTON Mr. Dolarhyde, I... I swear I didn't \nSTEAL YOUR-- -- a VIOLENT \"SSST\" from Dolarhyde JOSTLES the horses -- STRETCHING Roy tight enough to SNAP -- he SCREAMS -- \nDOLARHYDE Best not to interrupt me, Roy, makes the horses skittish. \n(THEN) You partial to history? Here's a primer, \nLISTEN CLOSE: He pulls out a WHIP, gripping it by its STERLING SILVER HANDLE. Starts CIRCLING the horses as he lets the whip UNFURL: \nDOLARHYDE (CONT'D) Following the War Of Northern Aggression -- what some ironically refer to as the \"Civil\" War -- came a prodigious nation- wide market for beef. Cowtowns sprang up all along these prairies, Roy; populated by enterprising young drovers -- among 'em, my daddy, Jeremiah Dolarhyde. Sold six of his gold teeth and a sword gifted to him by Robert E. Lee for twenty of the scrawniest Longhorns you ever saw -- then turned 'em into the fattest herd West of the Chisholm Trail. (stops: the WHIP) Watched him work this lash, driving those steer til his fingers bled... but what good's a whip without a herd, Roy? And slowly, torturously, SWEEPS the whip tip in the dirt... \nROY CLANTON Mr. Dolarhyde, Sir, you gotta believe me -- I went to take a piss and and -- saw a light in the sky -- blue -- and when I ran back the cows and fellas were gone! \n", "test2_true": "DOLARHYDE (CONT'D) Where's Percy? \nNAT COLORADO Jail. Sheriff locked him up. Dolar darkens. Unsheathes a KNIFE. Looks down at Roy: \nDOLARHYDE When're these people gonna lgarn? He STABS the knife down... SLICING the rope tethered to Roy's FEET. His lower body SLUMPS to the ground, he breathes a SIGH: \nROY CLANTON \nTHANK Y-- Dolar SLAPS the horse's rump, to which Roy's UPPER TORSO is tied; it GALLOPS off, dragging a SCREAMING ROY into the night. \nDOLARHYDE Everyone saddle up. Got us a sheriff to kill. As he MOVES OFF, Dolarhyde's eyes go to the Apache Woman. Something passes between them. She seems CONCERNED. \nNAT COLORADO Wasn't the sheriff, got him caught. It was a stranger. That STOPS Dolarhyde. He turns back, face dark: \nDOLARHYDE ... What stranger? \nNAT COLORADO Usually a man gives off a scent. Where he's been. What he's done. \n(STILL SPOOKED) He didn't have one. \nOFF DOLARHYDE, EYES BURNING -- \nINT. SHERIFF TAGGART'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nA BULLET, in close up, twirling between the thumb and forefinger of SHERIFF TAGGART. Boots up on his desk, TROUBLED. Deputy Wade pours himself a cup from a TIN POT OF COFFEE: \nDEPUTY CHARLIE WADE Percy wouldn't've come in shooting without his daddy's say-so, Kyle. You best get ready for a war 'cause that's what's comin'. \nSHERIFF TAGGART Tomorrow we ride the little shit up Phoenix way, turn him over. Dolarhyde's got a beef, he can take it up with the 6th cavalry. Taggart's on his feet, grabs his JACKET off the door -- \nSHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D) Goddamn tired of this... fatass rancher scaring good people off their lan-- He STOPS. Something catches his eye on the posting board. YANKS a piece of paper off, a mixture of CONFUSION and CONCERN \nSHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D) Sonofabitch. WHAT DOES HE SEE? Before we get a chance to KNOW -- \nEXT. SALOON - NIGHT \nEMMETT'S FACE rises into frame, peering into the saloon from below a windowsill. Sees THE MAN IN BLACK at the bar as --- \nINT. SALOON - NIGHT \n-- he SLUGS back a shot, the dog at his feet, still eyeing that steak on Atticus' plate. The Man points to his GLASS: \nTHE MAN IN BLACK Another. \nMARIA You drink like a man who wants to forget. \nTHE MAN IN BLACK (haunted; the irony) Other way round. The dog WHINES AGAIN for the steak. Atticus SLAMS down his silverware. Draws his GUN -- \nATTICUS You got three seconds to get your dog outta here or I blow his balls off. \nTHE MAN IN BLACK (without a blink) Not my dog. \nATTICUS Q=... two... -- and just before \"three\"... CA-CLICK. Atticus FREEZES, because there's a RIFLE BARREL at the back of h,iS head now: \nVOICE (O.S.) Give you odds you don't get to 'three.' RACK TO FIND the person holding the rifle is A WOMAN. Beautiful. EXOTIC. Dressed in leather. Meet ELLA SWENSON. ON THE MAN IN BLACK. Can't help himself. immediate and undeniable CHEMISTRY. But she pays him no mind -- makes a PSST sound and the dog snaps to her side. Atticus uncocks his gun, slowly slides it back in the holster -- \nATTICUS I was just havin' some fun, Miss -- \nELLA Give- him, the steak. Atticus HESITATES, angry at the humiliation. Ella PRESSES THE GUN HARDER against his neck, lowering him -- and his plate -- to the floor. Right in front of the dog, who GROWLS -- \nELLA (CONT'D) Now say you're sorry. \nATTICUS (biting his tongue) I'm-- sorry. \n", "test2_id": 697, "test3_input": "EMMETT I can protect myself -- shoot, I'm the only master bowman in my archery club. Won the county tournament by shootin' a flipped nickel at 50 paces. \nMEACHAM Somethin' tells me these things don't carry nickels, son. Answers's no. \nEMMETT You want me to ride off with the chickenshits, then double back, be happy to. But let's just skip that part and get to it, Padre. And that's the truth. Meacham sighs, no choice... finally: \nMEACHAM Go fill your canteen, dammit. He SLAPS the reins and the wagon rides off. Emmett GRINS and mounts the pony, then sees... JAKE riding past. ANGRY EYES from Ella as she heels her horse and TROTS OFF angrily: \nELLA C'mon, Happy. But HAPPY remains, torn between them, tail wagging and looking up at Jake as if to say: PLEASE COME? \nJAKE Oh shut up. Suppressing GUILT, he rides on toward the hills -- as Dolarhyde VEERS his horse in front of Jake, cutting him off: \nDOLARHYDE I was ridin' into town to kill you for what you done to my son. You owe me your life, Boy. \n(BEAT) Ride with us, we'll call it square. His hand rests on his nickel-plated .38. Eyes gleaming cruelly. \nJAKE You that fast? \nDOLARHYDE \nFAST ENOU-- -- WHOOSH: Jake's hand is already UP with his own PISTOL, having drawn before Dolarhyde can finish his sentence: \nJAKE Now you owe me y.Q= life. We're square. In a DAZZLING TWIRL, Jake slaps it back in his holster. Point made, he RIDES ON. Dolarhyde, burning mad at having been out- drawn, turns to CULOBAI)U -- speaks LOW: \nDOLARHYDE Follow him. Soon as he's got his back turned... kill him. \nShit. Colorado hesitates. Dolar GLARES: \"Do it.\" Finally Colorado NODS acquiescence, moves off... JAKE -- on the OUTSKIRTS of town now -- riding past Meacham and Doc on the WAGON: \nMEACHAM Figure out which way you're headed yet? \nJAKE West. Saguaro Pass. \nMEACHAM That's not what I meant. The inference LANDS on Jake. But he's in no mood. GALLOPS off. Meacham watches Jake go... MUSIC RISES AS WE DISSOLVE THROUGH: \nEXT. DESERT PLAINS \nJAKE -- RIDING HARD THROUGH THE DESERT: A man running from his demons, or maybe toward them... through plains and pasturage... until he sees the tilted ROAD SIGN: \"SAGUARO PASS.\" Up ahead, he sees DEBRIS... Part of a ROOF, lying broken on the ground. Pieces of a STONE CHIMNEY. Jake comes over a rise... to REVEAL: \nEXT. ABANDONED CABIN - DAY \nA DESTROYED LOG CABIN. Walls partially TORN AWAY. Something in Jake is DEEPLY STIRRED. Dismounts, tentatively... walks up to the PORCH. Boots CRUNCH over broken window glass as they ENTER: \nINT. ABANDONED CABIN - CONTINUOUS \nLIGHT BEAMS stream in. Eerie quiet. Jake takes it in, HAUNTED. Something CRUNCHES under his boot -- DRIED FLOWERS. Sticking out from an OVERTURNED CRACKED VASE. Jake BLINKS, affected -- Bends over, TOUCHES the VASE AS: MEMORY FLASECUT! FRESH FLOWERS in a woman's hand... THE W B& FROM JAKE'S PICTURE. She smiles at him -- \nTHE WOMAN You shouldn't have. She turns, drops the flowers into the vase as we see she's talking to JAKE. \nJAKE Got you somethin' else. \nCLINK -- He drops a LEATHER POUCH on the table next to the vase. A FEW GOLD COINS clink out. The woman turns to him, WORRIED: \nTHE WOMAN Where'd you get this? \nJAKE Where do you think? The woman looks to the pouch -- Picks up one of the coins. TORN. Jake moves behind her. Close. An INTIMACY here. \nTHE WOMAN Your boys '11 come after you. ON JAKE. Dark. But DETERMINED: \nJAKE Let 'em come. She turns to him, their eyes HOLD... and they KISS. Soft. Tender. Soulful. But then -- a THUNDERCRACK turns their attention to the window: A STORM CLOUD on the horizon. Same kind that consumed the town. The cabin starts to VIBRATE like a tuning fork. The pouch slides off the table... THE GOLD COINS SPILL OUT and -- \nBACK TO PRESENT - JAKE REELING. What is this memory? Who the hell is the woman? Something GLINTS in the far wall where the chimney used to be: \nONE OF THE GOLD COINS EMBEDDED in the wood. Jake pulls it out of the wall, a thousand questions in his eyes. Sunlight SHIMMERS off it and -- MEMORY FLASHCUT! The spilled coins start SLIDING across the floor all by themselves, as if magnetically drawn to THE CHIMNEY -- WHOOSH! -- SUCKED right up into it by some VACUUM FORCE! \nTHE WOMAN What's happening?!!! \n", "test3_true": "KA-CHINNNG!

Doc, sipping from his canteen, does a SPIT TAKE. Ella's eyes DRILL Greavey. Cut down a peg, he tips his hat, red-faced: \nGREAVEY Ma'am.

Something FLASHES in Dolarhyde. But he's contained: \nDOLARHYDE Yeah. \nEMMETT Then maybe you should use that thousand dollars to buy yourself a new wife. Emmett HOLDS his look against Dolarhyde's. Brave and UNFLINCHING. Doc can't help but grin at the kid's moxie... but it's short-lived as his face suddenly falls: \nDOC Madre Dios... And we PAN AROUND, dropping over his shoulder to see what he's reacting to -- AN ENORMOUS CRATER. ACRES WIDE... TWENTY FEET DEEP. Even Dolarhyde looks nervous now: \nDOLARYHYDE What the... hell is it? \nMEACHAM It was Winfield's Landing. They turn to see Meacham, brushing the DUST off a WOODEN SIGN: Holds it UP. \" Winfield's Landing... Population 133.\" ON GREAVEY AND THE MEN. Shit.

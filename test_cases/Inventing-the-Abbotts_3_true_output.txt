Alice turns and steps into another shop -- leaving Doug behind on the sidewalk.

PERRY COMO SINGS "The Little Drummer Boy" ON the TELEVISION. Doug rises from the sofa.

Helen is peeling apples to make a pie.   Doug enters and studies her for a beat. 
DOUG Are you okay? 
HELEN I'm fine. 
DOUG You look... tired. 
HELEN Just a cold. 
DOUG You sure? (CONTINUED)

HELEN I do wish Jacey had come home for Christmas. Maybe that's what's wrong with me. 
DOUG I guess that free-lance drafting job was too good for him to turn down. 
HELEN I don't think that's why he didn't come home. I wrote him a letter, you know. About Lloyd and me. Has he mentioned it to you? 
DOUG No. 
Doug wants to avoid the topic of Jacey.    He opens the refrigerator. 
DOUG When did you start drinking beer? 
HELEN Oh... I bought those for you. I had them in the basement; I kept forgetting to bring them up. 
He does a bemused take on her. 
HELEN Good heavens, I know you drink beer. 
Doug takes out two bottles of beer and opens them. 
DOUG Here.   Have one with me. 
HELEN I bought those for you, honey. 
DOUG It's not good to drink alone, Mom. 
HELEN Don't be silly. 
DOUG Come on.   Sit down.   Have a beer.

He pulls out a chair for her. She reluctantly comes over and sits down. Doug sits and proposes a toast. 
DOUG Merry Christmas. 
HELEN Merry Christmas. (takes a sip) It's beer. 
DOUG Let's drink 'em all. 
Helen laughs girlishly. 
HELEN Charlie was always trying to get me to drink beer. 
DOUG Why do you always call him Charlie? 
HELEN That was his name. 
DOUG Why don't you ever say 'your father'? 
HELEN Sometimes I do, don't I? I don't know. When I think of him, I think of 'Charlie.' 
DOUG Did you ever... meet anybody else? 
HELEN You mean another man? 
DOUG Yeah. 
HELEN Well, everyone always thinks things are more possible than they are. I mean, single men don't stay in Haley if they have any starch. The only eligible man around was Drew Carter, but he smells like his dog.

LEE I need your help, Master.  I'm seeking a man who used to train with you.  He's become a killer - the worst kind of animal. 
MASTER FU Animals kill only from hunger or fear. The man you seek is lower than a serpent. (faces Lee) ...he kills for money. 
In the b.g., we see the kids leaping acrobatically over Carter from all sides.  Carter, frustrated, tries to grab the kids out of the air as they fly by, but they elude him.  They disappear O.S. 
Lee and Master Fu walk another moment, Master Fu lost in thought. 
MASTER FU (CONT'D) He was the best I ever trained, you know. 
LEE Ricky Tan? 
MASTER FU No.  Your father. (Lee reacts) Your father and Ricky Tan were my favorite students... and for such awful things to happen as they did -- 
Lee cuts off Master Fu's reminisces -- he's obviously uncomfortable. 
LEE How do I find Ricky Tan? 
AGAIN IN THE B.G., Carter and the flying kids go zipping by in the other direction, disappear O.S. 
Master Fu pats the SOIL around a struggling plant. 
MASTER FU A seeding spends its entire life reaching towards Heaven. 
LEE I know, Master, but... 
MASTER FU The answers you seek can be found in Heaven on Earth. 
LEE Heaven on Earth?  Master, I don't understand. (working it) A temple, where Heaven is on Earth?  A mountain, where Earth reaches for the -- 
MASTER FU It's a massage parlor downtown.  "Heaven on Earth."  You will find your answers there. 
Lee bows to Master Fu, slowly turns to walk back down the pathway. 
MASTER FU (CONT'D) Wait!  Put a c-note in the jar. 
Lee puts a few bills in the jar, heads down a pathway. Master Fu walks over and takes the cash. 
MASTER FU (CONT'D) Cheap bastard... 
EXT. MONASTERY SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS 
Lee emerges from the path, stops when he sees Carter -- two students headlocked under each arm, another two scissor locked between his legs, holding another two down with his hands, and sitting on the last one. 
CARTER And that's how you use the LAPD choke hold.  Now start practicing and don't make me come back here! 
LEE Carter...you ready to have some fun!? 
EXT. HEAVEN ON EARTH MASSAGE PARLOR - DAY 
A neon light hangs above the upscale massage parlor. 
LEE Just follow my lead and act like a tourist. 
CARTER I am a tourist. 
INT. HEAVEN ON EARTH MASSAGE PARLOR - CONTINUOUS 
Lee and Carter walk into an upscale MASSAGE PARLOR and stand in a lobby.  SOFT MUSIC is playing. 
HOSTESS Good afternoon, gentlemen. 
Lee bows, followed by Carter. 
LEE (in Chinese) Hello.

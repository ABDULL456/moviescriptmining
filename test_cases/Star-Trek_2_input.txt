BONES ... Same ship, different day. 
As Kirk rejoins his crew for hugs and congratulations, we go to the BACK of the hangar... SPOCK PRIME. Watching. Moved beyond words. He turns and leaves them to it... as he goes... 
KIRK/SHATNER (V.O.) I know what you'd say -- `It's their turn now, Jim...' And of course you're right... but it got me thinking: 
INT. STARFLEET HOSPITAL - EARTH - DAY 
Our montage comes full circle as we END on Kirk's transmission: 
KIRK/SHATNER Who's to say we can't go one more round? By the last tally, only twenty five percent of the galaxy's been chartered... I'd call that negligent. Criminal even -- an invitation. (MORE) 
CONTINUED: KIRK/SHATNER (CONT'D) You once said being a starship captain was my first, best destiny... if that's true, then yours is to be by my side. If there's any true logic to the universe... we'll end up on that bridge again someday. 
Stops, grins.   Because this is the part he needs to say most... 
KIRK Admit it, Spock. For people like us, the journey itself... is home. 
Young Spock's face.   Lost in feelings that flood through him.

SKILL DOMES: Questions to be spoken or represented graphically and answers to be dispersed to Vulcan children at directors discretion. 
Q: What is the arc length of a curve from x equals a to x equals b? 
A: The integral, from a to b, of the square root of one plus the squared derivative of y with respect to x, d x. 
Q: Calculate the dimensionality of a fractal whose initiator divides into three equal parts, each of which is replaced by four parts. 
A: 1.26 
Q: What is the dimensionality of a fractal whose initiator divides into r equal parts , each being replaced by N equal parts? 
A: Dimensionality equals the logarithm of N divided by the logarithm of r. 
Q: A cone is sliced by a plane that does not intersect the base, nor is the plane parallel to the base. What shape is formed by the intersection? 
A: An ellipse. 
Q: What is the formula for the volume of a sphere? 
A: Four-thirds pi times the radius cubed. 
Q: What is the electrical charge of an up-type quark? 
A: Positive two thirds. 
Q: A discount function with exponential discounting for all periods, and an additional scalar discount for the present, is called what? 
A: Quasi-hyperbolic. 
CONTINUED: (3) 
Q: An excessively impatient person, who discounts future values solely because they are not in the present, is called what? 
A: A hyperbolic or quasi-hyperbolic discounter. 
Q: In an infinitely repeated classic prisoners' dilemma, how many subgame perfect equilibria exist? 
A: Infinitely many. 
Q: How many equilibria exist in a classic Hawk-Dove strategic interaction game? 
A: Two in pure strategies and one in mixed strategies.    (The mixed strategy equilibria is unstable.) 
Q: What are the two key features of a pure public good? 
A; Non-excludability and non-rivalry in consumption. 
Q: What is the only known intelligent life form to have achieved faster-than-light travel without political unification? 
A: Humans. Assuming, of course, you regard humans as intelligent.

A: LEAVE UNANSWERED 
Q: What are the four key dimensions of Vulcan aesthetics?

The gang reels it in. Suddenly, the whole apparatus JOLTS. 
EXT. THE BADLANDS - NIGHT 
A great beef-paw yanks the end pipe under the tree. 
STEEL TEETH 
pinch the metal tube shut. 
INT./EXT. TREE HOUSE - NIGHT 
The vacuums build pressure fast. WHINE crazily. 
THE GANG 
leaps from tree house. 
SQUINTS 
lingers in the trap doorway a second too long: 
EXT. TREEHOUSE - NIGHT 
The gang (minus Squints) is face down in the dirt - arms over heads. The vacuums explode. Foggy clouds of dust pour out of the treehouse. Squints appears. He's battleship grey. Takes his glasses off. Only his eyes show white. 
SQUINTS We've been going about this all wrong. I blame myself. We need total surprise. (MORE) 
SQUINTS (CONT'D) Therefore, we tunnel. The Beast will never expect it. 
EXT. TIMMONS' BACKYARD - DAY 
The guys all wield a shovel, and have flashlights taped to their baseball caps like coal miners. 
INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - DAY (DARK) 
Flashlight beam at the fore, Scotty crawls with a safety rope 'round his waist. He pokes the cardboard periscope up through the dirt. 
THROUGH THE PERISCOPE 
the Badlands from ULTRA LOW ground level. WE SCAN 360 degrees. Suddenly, the scan stops. The name B A B E R U T H, FILLS the periscope's lens. 
EXT. THE BADLANDS - DAY 
Scotty's hand feels for the Babe Ruth. He grabs it. It's slimey. 
SCOTTY (O.S.) (SUBTERRANEAN) I got it! I got it! 
The ball SQUIRTS out of his fingers. 
THE BALL ROLLS 
beneath the lean-to. It hits 
THE BEAST 
in the nose. With a SEISMIC ROAR The Beast leaps out. WE DON'T SEE MUCH. He's too big. We're too close. 
EXT. TREE HOUSE - DAY 
Yeah-Yeah SHOUTS to Ham at the tunnel entrance. 
YEAH-YEAH It's huge - oh, my God! It's huge - pull him out! It's huge! PULL HIM OUT! 
EXT. BADLANDS - DAY 
THE BEAST'S JAWS dive toward Scotty's hand. They get within an inch of Scotty's hand, and his fingers vanish - THWOOOP! 
EXT. TIMMONS' BACKYARD - DAY 
The gang pulls Scotty out of the hole. Yeah-Yeah is unconscious on the grass. The guys turn a hose on him. He comes 'round SCREAMING: 
YEAH-YEAH It's huge - pull him out! Oh God, it's like a dinosaur! Wh - Wh - Where am I?! 
SQUINTS Yeah-Yeah! Get hold of yourself! What'd you see?! 
YEAH-YEAH (accelerating to lunacy) Oh-oh, it was like hugeness and darkness and like the world was ending and the devil came up through the ground and the - and the - and the - 
HAM - somebody slap him quick! We're losin' him! 
WHAP-WHAP! Squints administers. Yeah-Yeah snaps out of it. 
YEAH-YEAH Thanks. I needed that. 
EXT. TIMMONS' BACKYARD - DAY 
Construction completes. A kid crane. A tricycle, block 'n tackle, fishing-pole n' body harness. In a line, the guys step on and off a scale. Everybody stares at Yeah-Yeah. 
YEAH-YEAH Yeah-yeah, I know - I'm lightest. But I ain't goin' over there! NO WAY! 
All eyes to the ground. 
BENNY Sorry, Smalls. It was a good idea anyway. 
DENUNEZ Yeah, tough luck, Smalls. 
HAM It won't be that bad, Smalls. Your dad'll probably only shoot you or something.

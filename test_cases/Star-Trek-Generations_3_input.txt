55   INT. READY ROOM                                             55 
Riker is standing next to Picard, who has his back turned and is staring out the window. Picard seems distracted during the scene, his mind clearly elsewhere as Riker finishes his report. 
RIKER We found two dead Romulans aboard the station. We're analyzing their equipment to see if we can determine what ship they came from. 
Picard nods absently. 
PICARD There's still no indication of why they attacked the station? 
RIKER We think they were looking for something -- they practically tore the place apart. 
PICARD Hmm... (beat) Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector. 
RIKER You want me to contact Starfleet? 
PICARD Is there a problem? 
RIKER No, sir. 
PICARD Thank you, Number One. 
Picard keeps his back turned, looking out the window. Riker hesitates, awkward. 
RIKER There is something else, Captain. One of the scientists. a Doctor Soran... has insisted on speaking with you. (beat) I told him you were busy, sir, but he said it was absolutely imperative that he speak with you right away. 
PICARD Understood. That will be all. 
RIKER Sir... is there anything wrong? 
PICARD No. Thank you. 
A beat, then Riker turns and EXITS. Off Picard's unreadable face... 
CUT TO: 
56   INT. TEN FORWARD                                            56 
The room is bustling with patrons and activity. Data ENTERS with an odd look on his face...his body language subtly altered. He is looking at the world through new eyes. Geordi is following him closely, watching his every move. They move to the bar. Guinan comes over -- she has not aged at all since the Enterprise-B. She sets down an exotic-looking container full of dark liquid. 
GUINAN You two just volunteered to be my first victims. (re: liquid) This is a new concoction I picked up on Forcas Three. Trust me, you're going to love it. 
She pours two glasses of the liquid. Data takes one and sniffs it, then takes a drink. Geordi watches him closely. Data frowns. 
GEORDI Well...? 
DATA I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response. 
GEORDI Really? What do you feel? 
DATA I am uncertain. I have had little experience with emotions... I am unable to articulate the sensation. 
GUINAN Emotions? 
GEORDI I'll explain later... 
Data finishes the drink... concentrates, tries to make sense of the rush of feelings. His expression is one of disgust. 
GUINAN (to Geordi) I don't think he likes it. 
DATA (excited) Yes. That is it. I hate it. 
GEORDI Data, I think the chip is working... 
Data looks at Geordi with a big smile on his face. 
DATA Yes. I hate this! It is revolting! 
Beat. 
GUINAN Another round? 
DATA Please. 
In the b.g., we see Picard ENTER Ten Forward. 
57   FOLLOW PICARD                                               57 
as he walks through Ten Forward and heads toward a table by the windows. Soran is sitting at the table, staring out at the stars, lost in thought. His observatory uniform is distinctive, and sets him apart from everyone else in the room. Picard walks up to the table. 
PICARD Doctor Soran...? 
SORAN Yes, yes, Captain -- thank you for coming.

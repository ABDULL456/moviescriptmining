INT. ROGER'S VAN - CONTINUOUS ACTION Roger looks at the phone. It wasn't supposed to go like that. He looks at The Emperor. ROGER Well, Mr. Fancy Pants. You can wipe that stupid smile off your face. I don't think they love you as much as you think they do. He glances at his watch.      He believes Mrs. Lo Biancho and is PANICKING. 
INT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS ACTION Parker and Warren are scanning the sidewalk ahead for Drew. PARKER Where'd she go? WARREN I think she took a right up there. PARKER (to Driver) Follow my sister. TAXI DRIVER I thought we were the ones being followed. (CONTINUED)

INT. ROGER'S VAN He hits redial.       Mrs. Lo Biancho answers. MRS. LO BIANCHO (V.O.) Yesss? ROGER Okay.    Here's how we make the -- MRS. LO BIANCHO (V.O.) (interrupting again) -- First of all, you forgot to disguise your voice. ROGER (to himself) Damn it! MRS. LO BIANCHO (V.O.) Secondly, my husband will meet you in ten minutes on the corner of 43rd and Broadway. He'll have the money. Bring the dog. ROGER But that's ridiculous!     You'll just bring the police!     No way! Consider him Kung Pau! MRS. LO BIANCHO Fine. ROGER Don't hang up! MRS. LO BIANCHO The police, it appears, have other priorities, like humans or something. And I assure you, the Hotel Security... people... will not interfere. In any case, little man, we just want the dog back before showtime, do you understand? (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: ROGER (beat) Okay. MRS. LO BIANCHO Ciao. She hangs up.        Roger does, too. ROGER (to The Emperor) No wonder you look so happy. As far as you're concerned, you've escaped from the Wicked Witch of the West.

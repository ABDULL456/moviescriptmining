Sigfried cuts a "Something wrong with that?" look at Ted. 
SIGFRIED Yah, Sigfried. 
TED Nice to meet you, Sigfried. 
Ted cautiously takes Sigfried's hand. 
SIGFRIED Very impressive, Ted. "Theo the Thumper?"... Ouch. It's a deal, kid. Ted it will be. 
TED Thanks. 
Sigfried holds onto Ted's hand. The soft sound of distant fireworks pops in the background. Car horns and a muffled countdown signal that it's New Year's. 
Sigfried moves uncomfortably close to Ted and from out of nowhere bolts forward, planting a wet kiss right on Ted's mouth. Something snaps in Sigfried. He is either really getting off on this or he is caught in the grips of a seizure. He doubles back on the floors. Ted and Angela watch as he flops around like a flounder with the cocked gun waving all over the place. Ted wipes his mouth with his jacket sleeve while trying to dodge the barrel of the gun. 
TED You okay, mister? I'll get help! 
Sigfried manages to steady the gun and point it directly at Ted. He signals for Ted to go to the bathroom. 
TED (continuing) That's the wrong door, sir. 
Sigfried grabs Ted by the leg and shove the barrel of the gun into his crotch. 
Sigfried pulls Ted's face closer to his. 
SIGFRIED Get me the nitro... it's in the bathroom cabinet. Now! 
Ted rushes into the bathroom, leaving Sigfried a babbling mess behind. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BATHROOM--SAME TIME 
Ted enters the bathroom, which appears shaken by an earthquake. Towels and wet clothes are all over the place. An evening gown is flushed halfway down the toilet and pills are everywhere. Sigfried is shouting from the other room to hurry. Ted checks the cabinet, searching for a bottle marked "Nitro." No luck. 
Ted spots a small window set above the toilet. 
He figures this is the best chance he's got to make a break. 
Ted goes for it. He manages to get his head and one arm through the window before he gets stuck. His legs dangle in the bathroom. Struggle as he may, he can only hit the toilet- bowl lever, which sends a loud FLUSH SOUND out through the apartment. 
SIGFRIED (O.S.) (shouting in the distance) It's no time to take a leak, Teddy, I'm fucking dying here! 
EXT. BATHROOM WINDOW--NIGHT 
Outside the window, Ted's in another world. He's almost safe. It's a strange feeling, kind of like bathing in warm water in paradise, knowing a huge shark is ready to rip his ass off. He can see the flickering red glowing light from the witches' room from the floor below. 
EXT. BATHROOM WINDOW AND BELOW--NIGHT 
Ted sees Eva bopping naked past the window. He shouts her name out, to no avail. 
The MUSIC drowns out his voice and they ignore his calls for help. The blood rushes to his head. He lets himself hang there for a moment. He wonders how many other people have found themselves in situations like this before him. Probably everyone. Right next to his face, Ted recognizes a bloody hand print. It's not his blood. 
EXT. BATHROOM WINDOW AND ABOVE--NIGHT 
Ted hears a sound from above and twists himself around, spotting a young man (previously seen as the Yuppie Scumbag on the phone) leaning out of the window directly above him. After a quick moment of sizing him up, Ted gathers himself. 
TED Hi... 
No answer. Something's wrong with the guy, all the blood is drained from his face and he is mumbling something. 
TED Listen, I'm stuck here in a situation that I can't even begin to explain, but would you be so kind as to get help? Could you call the police, please? 
Silence. 
TED (continuing) You okay? 
The young man manages to belt out the word "ice" just before hurling a mouthful of vomit toward Ted. It takes all Ted's strength to dodge the puke and pull himself back into the bathroom. He falls back on the floor. 
He props himself up and checks for damage. He notices something odd... the room is silent. No Sigfried. He walks into the bedroom. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOTEL BEDROOM--MOMENTS LATER 
Ted looks around the still room. No one's there. 
TED Sigfried? 
He heads toward the door and, from out of the corner of his eye, he spots Sigfried's hairy leg. Sigfried has passed out on the floor. Angela's chair has been knocked on its side. Ted races over to help lift her back up. He pulls the gag from her mouth. Angela jumps all over him.

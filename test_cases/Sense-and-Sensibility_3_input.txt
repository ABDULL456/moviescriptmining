MRS JENNINGS Give us a clue, Miss Dashwood--is he in uniform? 
ELINOR starts to change the subject, but MARGARET interrupts her. 
MARGARET He has no profession! 
SIR JOHN and MRS JENNINGS turn on her with screams of delight. ELINOR, MARIANNE and MRS DASHWOOD look at each other helplessly. 
SIR JOHN No profession! A gentleman, then! 
MARIANNE (with daggers) Margaret, you know perfectly well there is no such person. 
MARGARET There is! There is! And his name begins with an F! 
ELINOR looks hard at her plate. 
MRS DASHWOOD Margaret! 
MRS DASHWOOD is appalled at her youngest's relish for such a vulgar game. SIR JOHN and MRS JENNINGS are cock-a-hoop. 
SIR JOHN F indeed! A very promising letter. Let me--F, F, Fo, Fa... Upon my word, but I cannot think of a single name beginning with F-- 
MRS JENNINGS Forrest? Foster? Frost? Foggarty? 
MARIANNE suddenly stands up. SIR JOHN and MRS JENNINGS are so surprised they stop talking. Everyone stares at MARIANNE. 
MARIANNE (controlled fury) Sir John, might I play your pianoforte? 
SIR JOHN Of course, yes--my goodness. We do not stand on ceremony here, my dear. 
For once, ELINOR is grateful for her sister's rudeness as everyone rises and follows MARIANNE out. 
EXT. BARTON PARK - FRONT STEPS - EVE 
A soldierly MAN of about forty (COLONEL BRANDON) is dismounting from his horse. From within we hear MARIANNE's song begin. His head snaps up to the windows. An expression of pained surprise comes into his melancholy, brooding eyes. 
INT. BARTON PARK - MUSIC ROOM - EVE 
Everyone watches MARIANNE as she plays and sings. Behind them we see BRANDON entering. But he stays in the shadow of the door and no one notices him. CLOSE on his face. He gazes at MARIANNE with an unfathomable look of grief and longing. He breathes in deeply. Suddenly, ELINOR feels his presence and looks around at him. After a few moments, she turns back, slightly puzzled. The song finishes. Everyone claps. The MAN ventures out into the light and SIR JOHN springs from his seat. 
SIR JOHN Brandon! Where have you been? Come, come and meet our beautiful new neighbours! 
MRS JENNINGS What a pity you are late, Colonel! You have missed the most delightful singing! 
BRANDON bows to the company and smiles slightly. 
COLONEL BRANDON A great pity, indeed. 
ELINOR looks at him, even more puzzled. 
SIR JOHN Mrs Dashwood, may I present my dear friend Colonel Brandon? We served together in the East Indies and I assure you there is no better fellow on earth-- 
MARGARET Have you really been to the East Indies, Colonel? 
COLONEL BRANDON I have. 
MARGARET What is it like? 
MARGARET is quivering with fascination. 
SIR JOHN Like? Hot. 
But COLONEL BRANDON knows what MARGARET wants to hear. 
COLONEL BRANDON (mysteriously) The air is full of spices. 
MARGARET smiles with satisfaction. 
SIR JOHN Come, Miss Dashwood--it is your turn to entertain us! 
ELINOR Oh no, Sir John, I do not-- 
SIR JOHN --and I think we can all guess what key you will sing in! 
SIR JOHN and MRS JENNINGS are bursting with their new joke. 
SIR JOHN/MRS JENNINGS F major! 
They fall about. 
INT. SIR JOHN'S CARRIAGE - NIGHT 
The DASHWOODS are returning home. A row is in progress. 
MARIANNE (to Margaret) As for you, you have no right, no right at all, to parade your ignorant assumptions-- 
MARGARET They are not assumptions. You told me. 
ELINOR stares at MARIANNE. MARIANNE colours and attacks MARGARET again. 
MARIANNE I told you nothing-- 
MARGARET They'll meet him when he comes, anyway. 
MARIANNE That is not the point. You do not speak of such things before strangers--

She doesn't answer. He turns to look back and we see his face, for the first time, in the headlights of the car behind. 
HIS POV 
The car behind them waiting, patiently. Rain drifts down past its headlights. 
Finally it pulls out and passes them slowly, their headlights showing it to be a battered green Volkswagon. First the car itself, then its red taillights, disappear into the rain. 
BACK TO THE MAN 
Cutting between him and the woman, each from behind. 
MAN ...You know that car? 
WOMAN No. 
MAN What's the matter? 
WOMAN I don't know... I just think maybe I'm making a mistake... 
She looks at the man. 
WOMAN ...What was that back there? 
MAN Back where? 
WOMAN Sign. 
MAN I don't know. Motel... Abby-- 
WOMAN Ray. Did you mean that, what you said before, or were you just being a gentleman? 
MAN Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now. 
WOMAN Yeah. 
MAN I mean, I ain't a marriage counselor-- 
WOMAN Yeah. 
The man is uncomfortable. 
MAN ...What do you want to do? 
The woman is uncomfortable. After a long pause: 
WOMAN ...What do you want to do? 
MOTEL ROOM 
Pulling back from RAY and ABBY in bed, making love. 
The only light is from cars passing along the highway outside. Each sweeping light-by ends in black. 
The pullback ends in a wide shot of the motel room. The black following the last car lingers. 
A telephone rings. 
SAME WIDE SHOT  MORNING 
Ray and Abby are asleep. On a nightstand next to the bed, the telephone is ringing. 
Ray stirs, reaches for the phone. 
RAY ...Hello. 
VOICE Having a good time? 
RAY ...What? Who is this? 
VOICE I don't know, who's this? 
A silence at both ends. 
VOICE ...You still there? 
RAY Yeah, I'm still here. 
Ray listens to another silence. It ends with a disconnect. 
Abby is stirring as Ray gets out of bed. 
ABBY ...Ray?

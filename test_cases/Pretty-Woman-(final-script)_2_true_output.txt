PHILIP Edward, how... how do you know that this girl... hasn't attached herself to you because she's bringing information back to Morse ? This happens ! Industrial espionage... 
EDWARD Phil, Phil, Phil ! Phil, listen to me. 
PHILIP What ? 
EDWARD She's not a spy. She is a hooker. 
PHILIP Oh ! 
EDWARD She is a hooker. I picked her up on Hollywood Boulevard. In your car. 
Philip laughs. 
PHILIP Oh, you are... 
EDWARD Yes, yes. 
PHILIP Oh, man ! 
He keeps on laughing louder. He snorts. 
PHILIP You know, you're the only millionaire I ever heard of... who goes looking for a bargain basement streetwalker, you know ? 
SENATOR ADAMS (voice over) Edward ! 
EDWARD I'm sorry I told you. 
Edward walks toward Senator Adams, who is calling him. Philip keeps on laughing. 
EDWARD Senator. Senator Adams, I'm pleased you could make it. 
Medium shot on the Senator. Edward walks to him and shakes his hand. 
SENATOR ADAMS Thank you. I hope the information I gave you was helpful. 
Back on Philip, who walks away with a laughing face. 
EDWARD (voice over) Oh, absolutely, yes, and thank you for it. 
Back on Edward with the senator. 
EDWARD There's no change, is there ? 
SENATOR ADAMS No, it's still bogged down. 
Medium shot on Vivian, standing near a tree, with her hat in her hand. She is smiling. 
Philip walks behind her. Vivian stops smiling. 
PHILIP Having a nice time, Vivian ? 
She smiles again. 
VIVIAN Yeah, I'm having a great time. 
PHILIP Must be quite a change from Hollywood Boulevard, hmm ? She stops smiling and shows a very sad and worried face. 
VIVIAN What ? 
PHILIP Yeah, Edward told me. But don't worry : you're secret is safe with me. Listen, maybe, uh, you and I could get together sometime... 
He touches her bare arm with his sunglasses. 
PHILIP ...after Edward leaves. 
VIVIAN Yeah, sure. Why not ? 
We sense that Vivian feels like crying, but she masters her emotions and looks at Philip. 
PHILIP We'll just have to do that, hmm ? 
He puts the tip of his fingers on her bare shoulder. 
ELIZABETH (voice over) Philip ! 
Philip turns around to look at his wife. Then he walks away. Vivian remains on the same spot, with a very sad face. 
GWEN (voice over from the P.A.) Hi, tailgaters. I'd like to mention a couple of our silver sponsors... 
Close shot on Edward looking at Vivian. He smiles. 
GWEN (voice over from the P.A.) ...Jacobs Distributors, Norrell Saddlery, and we'd like to give a great big thanks to our platinum sponsor... 
Back to Vivian. She doesn't look at Edward and keeps the same sullen sad face. 
GWEN (voice over from the P.A.) Edward Lewis Enterprises. 
Applause and air horn blowing. 
Vivian crosses her arms, but doesn't look at Edward. 
ANNOUNCER (voice over from the P.A.) The ball is in for chukker number four. 
PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR EVENING 
Medium shot on the main door. It opens and Edward comes in, followed by Vivian. Vivian closes the door, and Edward looks at his mail lying on a small table. Vivian throws her hat and gloves on another table with a nervous movement. Edward turns around to look at her. 
EDWARD You all right ? 
VIVIAN I'm fine. 
She walks away. 
EDWARD Fine. That's good. Seven «fines» since we left the match. 
Edward picks up his mail and newspaper, and walks behind her. 
EDWARD Could I have another word, please ? 
The camera follows Edward in the room. In the background, across the open door of the bedroom, we see Vivian entering the bathroom. 
VIVIAN Asshole ! There's a word. 
She slams the bathroom door. 
EDWARD I think I liked «fine» better. 
Edward drops his mail and newspapers on the desk. 
Vivian opens the bathroom door, and stands near the open door. 
VIVIAN You know what ? Just tell me one thing : Why did you make me get all dressed up ? 
Edward walks toward her. The camera follows him. 
EDWARD Well, for one thing, the clothing was appropriate. 
PENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR EVENING 
Edward takes his jacket off. 
VIVIAN No, what I mean is, if you were gonna tell everybody I'm a hooker, - why didn't you just let me wear my own clothes, okay ? 
Edward sits down on the bed. 
EDWARD I did not... I did not... 
VIVIAN I mean, in my own clothes, when someone like that guy Stuckey comes up to me, I can handle it, I'm prepared. 
Edward starts unlacing his shoes. Vivian walks away toward the living room. The camera follows her. 
PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR EVENING 
Vivian is trying unsuccessfully to open a bottle of Coca-Cola. In the background, Edward is still sitting on the bed, taking his shoes off. 
EDWARD I'm very sorry. I'm not happy with Stuckey at all for saying or doing that. But he is my attorney. I've known him for ten years. 
Edward stands up and walks toward Vivian. 
EDWARD He thought you were some kind of an industrial spy. The guy's paranoid. 
VIVIAN What are you, my pimp now ? 
She puts the unopened bottle back on the table. 
VIVIAN You know, you think you can pass me around to your friends ? I'm not some little toy ! 
She walks away toward the bedroom. 
EDWARD Look, you're not my toy, I know you're not my toy.

WHITE WOMAN It was co-ed. 
FORREST 'Cause Jenny went to a college I couldn't go to. It was a college just for girls. 
EXT, GIRLS' COLLEGE/JENNY'S DORM - NIGHT (1963) 
Forrest sits outside Jenny's dorm in the rain. 
FORREST (V.O.) But, I'd go and visit her every chance I got. 
A car pulls up. A song is heard from the radio. Forrest, holding a box of chocolates, looks at the car. The two people inside the car begins to kiss and embrace each other. Jenny is inside the car with a boy. She leans back against the passenger side door as they struggle to get comfortable. 
JENNY Ouch! That hurts. 
Forrest gets up and runs toward the car. He tries to look in the window as he steps over to the driver's side door. He opens the door and begins to punch the boy inside. Jenny jump out of the car and runs over to Forrest. 
JENNY Forrest! Forrest! Forrest, stop it! Stop it! 
BILLY Jesus! 
JENNY What are you doing? 
FORREST He was hurtin' you. 
Jenny's date, named BILLY, gets out of the car angrily. 
BILLY What the hell is going on here? 
JENNY No, he's not! 
BILLY Who is that? Who is that? 
JENNY Get over there! 
Jenny turns and looks at Billy. He shoves Jenny's hands away from him. 
JENNY Billy, I'm sorry. 
BILLY What in the hell, git, would you git away from me! 
JENNY Don't... Wait a second! 
BILLY Git, just git away from me! 
JENNY Don't go! Billy, wait a second! 
Billy gets back into the car. 
JENNY He doesn't know any better! 
Billy pulls away as Jenny steps toward Forrest. 
JENNY Forrest, why'd you do that? 
Forrest holds out the box of chocolates. 
FORREST I brought you some chocolates. I'm sorry. I'll go back to my college now. 
JENNY Forrest, look at you! Come on. Come on. 
Jenny grabs Forrest hand and leads him toward the dorm. 
INT. JENNY'S DORM/HALLWAY 
Jenny and Forrest sneak to Jenny's door. 
FORREST Is this your room? 
JENNY Shh! 
Jenny unlocks the door and they step inside. 
INT. JENNY'S DORM ROOM 
Jenny pulls a robe off of her sleeping roommate's bed. Jenny hands the robe to Forrest, sitting on Jenny's bed. 
JENNY Do you ever dream, Forrest, about who you're gonna be? 
FORREST Who I'm gonna be? 
JENNY Yeah. 
FORREST Aren't I going to be me? 
JENNY Well, you'll always be you, just another kind of you. You know? I want to be famous. 
Jenny picks up a towel, then walks back toward Forrest. Jenny dries the water from her hair. 
JENNY I want to be a singer like Joan Baez. I just want to be an empty stage with my guitar, my voice... just me. 
Jenny takes off her slip and sits on the bed next to him. 
She is only wearing her bra and panties. Forrest looks at Jenny like he's never seen a woman in her underwear before. 
JENNY And I want to reach people on a personal level. I want to be able to say things, just one-to-one.

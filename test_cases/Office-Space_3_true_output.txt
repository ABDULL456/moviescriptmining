PETER Tom! Hi! This is someone I'd like you to meet. This is Joanna. 
JOANNA Hi. 
TOM Hi. Forgive me for not getting up. (He starts laughing and everyone joins in nervously) Ooh...Ooh... Uh, Peter, Peter, come here a minute. I want to show you something. 
They go into the kitchen. There's a Jump to Conclusions mat. It says ??? ; Jump Again ; Strike Out ; Could be ; Loose one Turn ; Yes! ; No! ; Accept it ; Go wild ; One step back ; Think Again ; Moot! On the bottom are footprints, under the word Start 
TOM Well, what do you think? It's a prototype. 
PETER Well, that's exactly as you described it. Uh, listen, I, I heard about your settlement. Congratulations. 
TOM Well, thanks, Peter. y'know, I'm glad you're here because I wanted to talk to you. I know how you get depressed about your job and all, and I just wanted you to know that's how you feel. I used to be the same way. 
PETER Really? 
TOM Sure. Oh maybe I didn't whine as much, but I hated my job as much as you and I've been doing good for over thirty years! 
PETER Wow. 
TOM Just remember 
If you hang in there long enough, good things can happen. I mean, look at me. 
He laughs. 
PETER Thanks Tom. 
TOM Aw, sure. 
[Scene The backyard. Samir and Michael are talking to Rob.] 
ROB Conjugal visits? Not that I know of. Now, a minimum security prison is no picnic. I have a client in there right now. You see, the trick is, kick someone's ass the first day or become someone's bitch. Then everything will be all right. Why do you ask, anyway? 
MICHAEL Oh, no, we were just seeing - 
His cup flies out of his hand and ice cubes go everywhere. 
Cut to Peter and Drew. 
DREW Hey Peter. 
PETER Drew.

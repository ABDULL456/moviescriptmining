FATS Please, I need my hands to work -- Christ, don't bust my thumbs. 
At wits' end the man picks up a large metal hook used by stevedores.  Rocky remains cool. 
ROCKY Goin' fishin'? 
The man drops the hook. 
ROCKY What's ya name again? 
FATS Bob. 
ROCKY Look, Bob, if ya wanna dance, ya gotta pay the band -- If ya borrow, ya gotta pay the man... Me, I ain't emotionally involved. 
Rocky's determined expression strikes home.  The fat man quickly fumbles through his pockets and hands over a small wad of bills. 
ROCKY (continuing; counting) A hundred an' thirty. 
FATS That's it, I'm broke. 
ROCKY That's it? -- Completely? 
FATS That's it. 
ROCKY What about for food an' stuff? 
FATS You have my food in ya hand. 
Rocky looks almost sympathetically into the fat man's flushed expression. 
ROCKY ... The juice is climbin' every week. 
FATS I know the juice is climbin' -- I been workin' six months just to pay the damn interest. 
ROCKY Ya still light seventy. 
FATS Waits! -- Be smart.  Ya don't have to break nothin' -- Here, take my coat, it's worth fifty-sixty dollars.  It's yours. 
The man quickly removes his coat and extends it... 
FATS (continuing) See, ya a smart guy, Gazzo's don't have to know nuthin'. I'll go tape up the hand like ya broke my thumb.  Gazzo won't be wise to nothin' -- Be a smart guy, keep the coat, we'll fake like ya broke the hand. 
The man extends his coat again... Rocky suddenly grabs the man's thumb and bends him to his knees. 
FATS (almost a whisper) No - no - no - Please - Please - Please don't... 
Rocky releases the man who remains almost in shock.  The thumb is fine. 
ROCKY ...That's what coulda happened. (walks off.) 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
Later that morning Rocky passes "Animal Town Pet Shop" in South Philly... The shop is not very prosperous looking.  In the window hangs a sign reading "Today's special -- Mixed Kittens -- $1.50"... Rocky stops at this shop every morning. He stares at a litter of Lhasa Apsa puppies.  He taps the window and whistles.  He SEES a girl behind the counter and presses his face against the window and does his impression of the Hunchback of Notre Dame.  The girl nervously looks away. 
The girl behind the counter is ADRIAN KLEIN.  She is not very attractive, but pleasant-looking.  Thirty years old. Brown hair pulled back.  Light skinned.  She wears glasses. 
Rocky really stops by to flirt with Adrian, but she is so painfully shy nothing ever gets started... Rocky enters. 
INT. PET SHOP - DAY 
ADRIAN ... Could you take the puppy out -- 
CUSTOMER It can breathe. 
ADRIAN Please - 
CUSTOMER Please, nothin' - I paid for this dog and can do whatever I want with it - I can throw it through the window if I want - Now give me my two dollars back before I do throw it through the window. 
Rocky walks over to her, stares hard in her face and snatches the bag out of her hand.  He removes the puppy and hands it to Adrian. 
CUSTOMER Get away from me - Give me that! 
Rocky takes a couple dollars out of his pocket and hands it to the lady... She nervously exits. 
ROCKY ... How's the turtle food this week? 
ADRIAN ... Fine. 
ROCKY Me, I'm kinda aggravated.

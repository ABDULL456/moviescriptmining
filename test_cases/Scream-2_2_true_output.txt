VOICE Hello? 
GIRL Who is this? 
VOICE You tell me. 
IN THE THEATRE 
Maureen is not having a good time. She's already spooked. 
MAUREEN I hate this shit. 
ON SCREEN The phone rings again. 
VOICE Why did you hang up on me? 
GIRL Who is this? 
IN THE THEATRE 
Maureen shifts in her seat. 
MAUREEN Why doesn't she just hang up and call the police? Stupid.. 
PHIL Shush. 
MAUREEN I'm gonna pee. You want anything? 
He nods. Maureen stands and moves up the aisle. 
INT. LOBBY - SECONDS LATER 
Maureen emerges from the theatre and into the small lobby. It is dark and shadowed. She moves down a long hallway to a staircase. A "BATHROOM" sign with an arrow points downstairs. 
Maureen hits the stairs to... 
INT. BASEMENT LOUNGE - SAME 
A small lounge leads to two bathroom doors. Very low lighting. Maureen descends the stairs, heading for the... 
INT. GIRL'S RESTROOM - SAME 
A large bathroom. Five stalls line one wall. The door CREAKS open. Maureen enters and shoots for a stall. 
INSIDE THE STALL - MOMENTS LATER 
Maureen finishes up, fastening her pants. Suddenly, the bathroom door CREAKS open. Maureen listens. FOOTSTEPS are heard. Loud and heavy. 
Maureen eyes the crack in the stall door. Not much is visible. Suddenly, a SHADOW sweeps by. The footsteps stop. 
Maureen finishes up quickly. She flushes, throws the stall door open and rushes out to find... 
THE BATHROOM EMPTY. 
The stall doors are all closed. Maureen shoots for the door. She rips the door open as a FIGURE rushes her... 
A YOUNG GIRL followed by her FRIEND, both perky and loud. They hurl past Maureen, LAUGHING and carrying on. 
GIRL #l I got so scared my bladder rolled. 
GIRL #2 You chicken shit. It's just a movie. 
GIRL # l No, it really happened. It's a true story. 
Maureen is out the door. Now thoroughly spooked. 
INT. BASEMENT LOBBY - SAME 
Alone, Maureen moves for the stairs when a FIGURE emerges from the shadows. A GHOST MASKED SHAPE appearing behind her... 
LUNGING FOR HER, grabbing her, spinning her around. She SCREAMS MADLY as the Ghost starts LAUGHING. The mask comes off. It's Phil. 
MAUREEN You ass. 
PHIL I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to. It was too easy. 
MAUREEN You are so not funny. 
Phil takes her in his arms. 
PHIL Come on, baby. Lighten up a little, will ya? 
MAUREEN I get scared really easy, okay.

SPOCK I have no comment on the matter. 
Kirk still stunned as Scotty moves to transporter control. 
SCOTTY If there's any common sense to their ship design, I'll be puttin' ya in a cargo bay, shouldn't be a soul in sight. 
KIRK AND SPOCK STAND ON THE TRANSPORTER PAD, SIDE-BY-SIDE AND FACING THE SAME DIRECTION FOR THE FIRST TIME -- AN ICONIC IMAGE - - The moment of truth. 
KIRK Energize. 
Scotty hits the transport and Kirk and Spock DISAPPEAR -- 
199   INT. NARADA - CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS                               199 
Kirk and Spock MATERIALIZE in the cargo bay... to find themselves suddenly smack-dab in the middle of SIX ROMULAN GUARDS working at cargo consoles!! 
199   CONTINUED:                                                        199 
For a split second they're as shocked as Kirk and Spock, until they ATTACK -- Kirk immediately engages the closest Romulan, struggles -- but Spock's a machine: his palm snaps up CRACKING a nose -- SLAMS a head against the wall -- as battle-ready as the Romulans are, it's like trying to catch a GHOST, Kirk finally knocks his one opponent unconscious, and turns to see it's ALL OVER -- 
KIRK (a touch insecure) Mine had a gun. 
SPOCK I am trained in the Vulcan martial art of Suus Mahna. 
Kirk and Spock move to a still conscious Romulan as he struggles to get up. Spock reaches for the fallen Romulan's temples. 
SPOCK (CONT'D) I am unable to meld with these Romulans -- there are subtle differences in their physiology I did not anticipate -- 
KIRK                                SPOCK -- punch him in the face -- make him talk! Suus Mahna his       -- Suss Mahna is only intended ass!                                for self-defense, he's no longer a threat -- -- then pretend it's a threat - - I'm your captain, that's an order! 
Spock PUNCHES the Romulan HARD -- and via Uhura's comlink translator, speaks in SUBTITLED ROMULAN: 
SPOCK (SUBTITLE) (CONT'D) What is your computer access code? 
The guard SPITS green blood at Spock, who PUNCHES him again -- 
SPOCK (SUBTITLE) (CONT'D) TELL! (PUNCH)    ME! (PUNCH) THE! (PUNCH) CODE!

As Uhura returns to the bridge, everyone's stations go DARK -- STATIC on screens -- 
CHEKOV They've activated the drill -- 
UHURA Communications and transporter inoperative --

204   INT. NARADA - CONTINUOUS                                           204 
A ROTATING SHIP SCHEMATIC -- Spock typing at a console, searching -- accesses two inter-cam windows: on one, SPOCK PRIME'S SHIP, THE JELLYFISH -- in a lower containment hold -- on the other: PIKE, unclear if he's dead or alive. 
SPOCK What you refer to as the "Red Matter Device" is in the main hangar -- and I've located Captain Pike. 
KIRK Is he alive? 
SPOCK Unknown. 
KIRK Let's move. 
They cover each other with phasers as they move down the hall -- 
205   INT. NARADA - MAIN HANGAR                                       205 
Captain Pike's shuttle and the Jellyfish sit parked among the equipment. Kirk and Spock stealthily board the Jellyfish -- 
206   INT. JELLYFISH - COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS                           206 
Kirk hits a console, a familiar voice comes to life: 
COMPUTER VOICE Voice print and face recognition analysis enabled. 
KIRK Spock, you'll be piloting the ship alone. 
SPOCK Which may be problematic, as I am unfamiliar with this ship's design. 
THE LASER GRID RESPONDS TO SPOCK'S VOICE, scans his features for ID -- THE HOLOGRAPHIC DISPLAY MATERIALIZES: 
COMPUTER VOICE Welcome back, Ambassador Spock. 
KIRK (awkwardly) Wow.   That's weird. 
He looks to Kirk in surprise -- Spock's eyes fix with sudden understanding. Ambassador Spock... of course... suddenly all the pieces start coming together... 
SPOCK Computer: what is your manufacturing origin? 
COMPUTER VOICE Stardate 2397, commissioned by the Vulcan Science Academy. 
Spock looks at Kirk, a touch upset: 
SPOCK It appears you've been keeping rather important information from me.

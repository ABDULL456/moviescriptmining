The greedy motherfucker! He's cutting the dope. BURNETT Yeah, but Julie told me his ship comes in on Friday? You wanna tell me who can cut a hundred mil worth a dope in five days? You'd need whole lotta time cards to make that kinda date. 
LOWREY Or one really smart sonofabitch. HOWARD We're    in the shit, boys. And there    ain't gonna be any more time cards    for this unit unless somebody pulls    a miracle out of their ass.

TIRE EMPORIUM - OFFICE - DAY                          B208 Two old codgers are trading stories in front of JOJO, a white boy with rasta dreadlocks. BURNETT Hey, Jojo. Through the office window, Jojo sees Burnett and sud- denly bolts out the rear door and runs smack dab into Lowrey, who body checks him back up against the office door. LOWREY Good runnin' into you, Jojo. 
208    INT. TIRE EMPORIUM - BATHROOM - DAY                        208 Now Burnett has pushed Jojo up onto the sink.   Lowrey hangs back, vibrating with anticipation. BURNETT Hey, calm down. A little rap, that's all. We're lookin' for someone who can step on a shitload of heroin. And do it real fast, and real well. We're lookin' for a pro. JOJO I'm in the rubber business now. BURNETT We're not playin' around with you, Jojo. You know what we want. 
JOJO I'm tellin' you straight up, like a straight fuckin' arrow, okay? I'm straight as a board. I'm so straight it's fuckin' sick. BURNETT Now there's a lotta dope, Jojo. Who can cut it quick? JOJO You mean, cut it... cut it up, yeah. I don't know anything about anything. Lowrey's had it.   He pulls his gun and pushes in. (CONTINUED)

You're a cop. I turn you    into 'Hard Copy,' man. Put you on    the T.V. set. BURNETT What are you doin', man? As Burnett tries to intercede, they talk over each other. 
LOWREY                           BURNETT We don't got time for            Mike. Chill with that. this. Jojo, I'm gonna            No. Don't do it! This kill you, man. I've got          is illegal!

(reaches behind his back) Wait. Wait. Burnett pushes in one last time and tries to talk Lowrey back. Lowrey acts like he lost it. He pulls another gun and points it at Burnett. LOWREY                           BURNETT Back up. I'm gonna bust          Right on. Jojo, you're your fuckin' ass too.            on your own. (then, back to                   (as he walks away) Jojo)                        I'm sorry for you, Jojo. Talk to me. Tell me what         I was on your side. I'll I want to know. I'll do          just be over here. I you man, say it. Come on.        don't want no skull fragments or brain shit on me. When that shit flies, it don't wash off. 
CLOSE ON JOJO scared shitless.   He's gonna die.   These are some crazy motherfuckers. BURNETT (chimes in again) Remember, partner. He's no good to us if you splatter his ass. (CONTINUED) 
BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/23/94 (PM)                91. 208   CONTINUED:   (2)                                  208 JOJO Okay, okay. I definitely don't know for sure. But I know a little for sure. Three guys... well, two guys and one of them's dead. Crazy rocket-scientist, Einstein fuckin' guy. Got some rich mommy and daddy. Tell you where he's at. LOWREY (holsters guns) Man, it's a good thing you got your memory workin'. Cuz that dead man paperwork is a bitch. 
BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM                             91A. 209   EXT. UPPER CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD (CORAL GABLES) - NIGHT         209 Staked out around the corner are Burnett and Lowrey. Each is clearly tired of the other. The silence is deadly until Julie breaks the silence. JULIE So where's the coffee and donuts? BURNETT What? JULIE I thought that was the usual menu when cops were on stakeout. A little caffeine for the heart. Some sugar-coated dough fried in day old grease. LOWREY Man. Will you get off this? You're making me sick. JULIE Oh, I'm sorry, Marcus. All     these hours on the case, you must    miss Theresa's home cooking. (near Lowrey's ear) Bet last night she fixed you    up something yummy and left it    in the microwave for you. Burnett starts to steam. LOWREY Yeah.   Somethin' yummy. JULIE I imagine there was something yummy waiting for you when you finally made it to bed -- BURNETT (wheels) Listen, lady -- But Burnett's face    ignites with headlights at their rear. Doors open.      Lowrey checks the rear-view mirror. He sees two private    security cops named DE SOUZA and TOWNE. They split     and approach either side of the unmarked sedan. LOWREY Oh, man.     It's the fuckin' pretend police. (CONTINUED) 
BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM                             92. 209   CONTINUED:                                                   209 BURNETT Be nice. After tomorrow we might need 'em for a job reference. Lowrey rolls down his driver's window in time to hear... TOWNE Well, what do we have back here? Looks like we got us two pimps and a hooker. DE SOUZA Hey, fellahs. Maybe if she does us both we'll let you leave with your pride intact. 
LOWREY Excuse me. One moment. (rolls up the window) Let's fuck with these bozos. Burnett nods his approval.   Lowrey lowers the window. LOWREY Now, where were we? TOWNE Outta the car. Hands where we can see 'em. Feet spread. Both hobby cops open the doors for Lowrey and Burnett respectively. Looks pass between them as they step out and assume the positions. And Towne starts by frisking Burnett's shoulders. BURNETT Oh, that's not how you frisk a potential lawbreaker. You gotta start at the waistband. See if he's carrying a piece. Towne stalls a beat, then self-consciously goes to Burnett's waistband where he feels a -- TOWNE Gun! Both hobby cops instantly withdraw, their own pieces drawn and leveled on Burnett and Lowrey.

{"train": "STAR TREK: NEMESIS \nSTAR TREK: NEMESIS \nby \nJohn Logan \nFADE IN: \nINT.  MEDICAL MONTAGE - DAY \nLife.  Glorious in its many forms.  The biological pulse finding its way heroically through the cold manipulation of science. \nCREDITS as we see a beautiful montage of futuristic medical technology.  Through a microscope we see cells multiplying and gene strands exponentially increasing with the vibrancy of exploding flowers.  We see laser splicing and biological manipulation on the molecular level. \nCREDITS continue as we fade to... \nINT.  ROMULAN SENATE CHAMBER - NIGHT \nPolitics... In a cavernous, shadowy chamber.  Dark figures lean together and talk seriously.  Their hushed, urgent tones denote the gravity of their discussion. \nWe can't make out the words but there is no doubt what they are talking about. \nThe three year old HUMAN BOY who stands before them.  The boy is alone and frightened, lost in the sweeping grandeur of the massive chamber. \nCREDITS continue as we fade to... \nEXT.  REMAN HOMEWORLD - NIGHT \nLabor... \nOn a stark, desert planet with monolithic mountains and harsh crags shooting upward.  The only light in this dark netherworld comes from the flames that accompany the hellish mining operations everywhere around us. \nThe human boy gazes over this desolate vista and then he looks up for a moment... at the stars. \nThen a tall figure leads him firmly into one of the mines. The boy seems to disappear into this flaming crucible. CREDITS end as we go to... \nEXT.  ROMULUS - SUNSET \nThe sun is setting on the capital city of the great Romulan Star Empire, The imperial monoliths and martial towers of this bustling city glow red as the sun dips below the horizon. \nWe slowly move down toward the most imposing building of the city.  The Romulan Senate chamber. \nINT.  ROMULAN SENATE CHAMBER - SUNSET \nSENATOR TAL'AURA watches the proceedings with a studied look of bored indifference.  She glances to the familiar Romulan crest that dominates one wall of the chamber: a ferocious bird-of-prey holding two planets, one in either claw. \nAnd then her eyes carefully cross the chamber to... \nPRAETOR HIREN -- the head of the Romulan government -- presiding over the Senate from a throne-like chair.  He is a capable politician in his 50s. \nSENATOR 1 ... but if we hesitate we'll lose this important source of dilithium. A trade agreement is in the best interests of the Empire. \nSENATOR 2 Praetor, I recommend we dispatch a diplomatic mission to Celes II to open negotiations. \nSenator Tal'Aura grunts slightly at the word \"negotiations.\" Praetor Hiren glances to her. \nPRAETOR Senator Tal'Aura, you disagree with the motion. \nTAL'AURA No, sir.  I would say \"negotiation\" is to be advised.  I support all \"diplomatic\" overtures.  But if you will excuse me, Praetor, I have an appointment with the Tholian ambassador. \nThe Praetor nods.  Tal'Aura stands and leaves the chamber... but she had left something behind on her desk.  A small, silver box with unusual etchings on the surface. \nThe discussion continues as we focus on the silver box... \nPRAETOR Then I will call for a vote on the motion to open trade negotiations with Celes II... \nThe Senator at the desk next to Tal'Aura's glances over.  The silver box is moving. \nThe Senator watches, amazed, as the box begins to slowly fold open.  Then \"legs\" appear.  The box unfolds like a spider, standing on its legs.  Then it is still for a moment.  The Senator looks at it, puzzled. \nSuddenly -- a bright beam of green light shoots up from the spider -- the Senators are stunned -- the beam shoots to the high domed ceiling of the chamber and then cascades around the interior of the room, enveloping everything in a glowing shroud of green energy.  In a way, it is bizarrely beautiful. \nAnd then just as suddenly the light disappears. \nA moment of silence.  The Praetor and Senators are baffled. \nPRAETOR Would someone please tell me what that was? (he turns to a guard) Alert security -- \nA plant behind the Praetor begins to shrivel... \nPRAETOR -- and have them run a -- \nPICARD The hell you will.  You know too much about me as it is... Now you promised there are no speeches during the ceremony on Betazed. \nRIKER No, no speeches.  No clothes either. (winks, mischievously) \nPicard looks at him.  Deanna laughs. \nThen the band stops playing.  All turn. \nDATA stands with the band. \nDATA Ladies and Gentlemen and invited Tran gendered species... In my study of Terran and Betazoid conjugal rites I have discovered it is traditional to present the \"happy couple\" with a gift.  Given Commander Riker's affection for archaic musical forms I have elected to present the following as my gift in honor of their conjugation. \nRiker shoots an amused glance to Deanna.  Conjugation? \nData turns to the band leader. \nDATA If you please, Mister Band Leader, a-one and a-two and... \nThe band launches into a jaunty, swing version of the Irving Berlin standard \"Blue Skies.\" \nDATA (sings) \"Blue skies, smiling at me, Nothing but blue skies do I see.  Blue birds, singing a song, Nothing but blue birds all day long.  Never saw the sun shining so bright, Never saw things going so right...\" \nThe crowd is appreciative.  Loves the song.  Except Worf, he momentarily raises his head from the table. \nWORF (groans) Ugghhh... Irving Berlin. \nHis heads thumps down again, is about ready to BARF! Meanwhile, Riker is anxious as a kid to join the band: \nDEANNA (smiles) All right, go ahead. \nRiker eagerly joins the band.  Grabs the trombone and starts jamming with the orchestra.  The song really swings. \nPICARD (to Deanna) May I have this dance? \nDEANNA With pleasure, Captain. \nMeanwhile, Geordi leads Leah to the dance floor as well. Beverly goes to Worf. \nBEVERLY Commander Worf... Do Klingons swing? \nWORF I am not a swinger.  I am unwell. \nBEVERLY Don't worry, I'm a doctor. \nShe pulls him to the dance floor as: \nBEVERLY I'm so glad you made it back to the Enterprise before I left. \nWORF I was not suited for the life of a... diplomat. \nBEVERLY (wry) Who'd have guessed? \nThey dance.  Picard and Deanna sweep past them. \nAnd we pull up and away as Data continues to sing and the crew dances.  It is a joyous celebration of these people. \nThis family.  A family we love. \nEXT.  ENTERPRISE - SPACE \nThe Enterprise streaks through space. \nINT.  ENTERPRISE - CREW LOUNGE - NIGHT \nData sits in the empty Crew Lounge. \nAs always, the android's placid, neutral expression still somehow manages to convey his wonder, curiosity and idiosyncratic zest for life. \nPicard arrives with a very old bottle of wine. \nPICARD I've been saving this.  Chateau Picard 2267.  Batten down the hatches... \nHe carefully uncorks the treasured bottle as: \nPICARD They say a vintner's history is in every glass.  The soil he came from.  His past as well as his hopes for the future. \nHe pours two glasses of the wine, then raises his glass, a toast. \nPICARD So... To happy endings. \nDATA To happy endings. \nPicard carefully takes a tiny sip, savors the flavor, finally swallows.  Enjoys it.  Ahhh. \nSHINZON Join us, Commanders.  Now what's the disposition of the fleet? \nSURAN They're holding position. \nSHINZON And? \nSURAN (bows his head) They will obey, Praetor. \nSHINZON It's imperative we retain their allegiance or our great mission will be strangled before it can truly draw breath. \nDONATRA They support your intentions, sir. But they require evidence of your... sincerity. \nShinzon looks at her.  A quick beat.  Shinzon decides to respond with benevolence.  He smiles. \nSHINZON And they'll have it. (he begins to pace over the star chart) Tell the fleet that the days of negotiation and diplomacy are over. The Almighty Federation will fall before us.  As I promised you. \nHe stands on the area of the map that denotes the Neutral Zone between the Romulan Empire and the Federation. \nSHINZON The time we have dreamed of is at hand.  The time... of conquest. (sinister laugh) \nHe carefully steps into the area of the map marked with the Federation symbol.  He looks down at the star chart. \nSHINZON Cut off the dragon's head and it cannot strike back. \nA beat.  Donatra watches him carefully.  Something in his quiet words disturbs her. \nSURAN How many Warbirds will you need? \nSHINZON None. \nThey look at him, stunned. \nSURAN Praetor.  You have the whole fleet at your disposal.  They supported the coup, they'll follow you. \nSHINZON The Scimitar will serve my needs. \nSURAN But surely -- \nSHINZON I came this far alone... (he looks at his Reman warriors) We came this far alone.  We require no assistance from the fleet.  Now leave me to my thoughts. \nThe Commanders and Senator Tal'Aura rise and leave.  Shinzon looks to his Viceroy. \nSHINZON Are we prepared? \nVICEROY Yes, Praetor. \nA beat. \nSHINZON So many years for this moment. (he looks up at his Viceroy, smiles) Bring him to me. \nINT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - DAY \nThe bridge crew are at their stations.  Picard is not on the bridge. \nWORF (grumbles) I won't do it. \nDEANNA It's tradition,Worf.  You of all people should appreciate that! (whispers) Besides, I've already seen it. \nWORF A warrior does not appear without his clothing.  It leaves him... vulnerable. \nRIKER I don't think we're going to see much combat on Betazed. \nDEANNA Don't be too sure.  Mother will be there. \nWorf groans.  Picard emerges from his Ready Room as: \nWORF I won't do it. \nPICARD Won't do what, Mister Worf? \nWORF Captain.  I think it is inappropriate for a Starfleet officer to appear... (hates the word) ... naked. \nPICARD Come now, a big, strapping fellow like you?  What are you afraid of? \nDeanna laughs.  Then a readout on Worf's console attracts his attention: \nWORF I'm picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the Kolarin system. \nPICARD What sort of signature? \nWorf looks up.  Glances at Data. \nWORF Positronic. \nThe shuttlebay doors slide open and the transport vehicle Argo emerges. \nThe Argo is larger than a regular shuttle with a particularly large cargo area at the back. \nEXT.  KOLARUS III - DAY \nThe Argo lands on the planet.  It is primarily a desert environment with some canyons and mountains.  Like Death Valley, blazing heat waves shimmer in the distance.  The shuttle sits silently for a moment.  We wonder at the delay, then... \nThe rear cargo doors slide open and Picard, Data and Worf roar out on a 24th Century equivalent of a military jeep! \nPicard drives, Data beside him.  Worf stands in the back at a mounted phaser canon.  It is a muscular, exciting vehicle; a Starfleet version of the jeep from old television series \"The Rat Patrol.\" \nPicard screeches to a stop.  Data and Worf lurch.  A cloud of dust momentarily obscures them.  Data quickly monitors the positronic signatures with a tricorder: \nDATA The closest signature is two kilometers to the west... that direction, sir. \nPICARD Thank you, Data. (he smiles) Let's see what she can do. \nHe roars off in a cloud of dust! \nPicard clearly enjoys driving.  He roars over the desert terrain at breakneck speed, having a hell of a good time. His comrades don't exactly appreciate his free-spirited driving panache. \nWorf clings on to the mounted phaser canon for dear life. Data steadies himself by grasping onto the rollbar \nDATA I will always be baffled by the human predilection for piloting vehicles at unsafe velocities. \nPicard smiles and drives a little faster. \nDATA (monitoring with tricorder) Over that rise, sir... half a kilometer. \nThey continue on.  Before long they can see something on the level desert floor before them.  They approach and stop to discover... \nAn android arm.  The fingers patiently drumming the ground. \nDATA It appears to be... (he scans with his tricorder) ... an arm. \nWORF (suspicious) Why is it moving? \nDATA Like me, it has been designed with modular power sources. \nPICARD Mister Worf, if you please. \nWorf climbs from the jeep and carefully approaches the arm. Gingerly picks it up.  The arm responds to being picked up, the hand starts feeling around in the air like something from a horror movie.  Worf shudders. \nHe returns to the jeep.  Quickly sets the arm down in the rear cargo area. \nDATA The next signature is one kilometer to the south. \nPicard starts the jeep in motion. \nTime passes as they continue on... coming across another arm... a leg... a torso... another leg... various disassembled components of a Data-like android! \nEXT.  JEEP - KOLARUS III - CANYON - DAY \nWorf stands uneasily amidst the moving body parts.  There is only one component missing: the head.  Picard steers the jeep into a canyon.  Stops.  Data scans with his tricorder, pointing it up into the gently sloping hills that form the sides of the canyon. \nDATA The final signature is approximately 300 meters up that incline. \nPICARD Mister Worf, accompany Data please. \nWORF (uneasy) To find the head, sir? \nPICARD (amused) If you don't mind. \nWorf and Data climb up into the hills in pursuit of the final piece as Picard opens the jeep's hood and checks the engine. \nEXT.  KOLARUS III - HILLS - DAY \nWorf and Data climb as Data scans and indicates the direction: \nDATA Ten meters... \nWorf pulls his phaser, ready. \nDATA I think it unlikely you will need your phaser to recover the cranial unit.  Of course, it could bite you. \nThen they see it. \nData's head.  Or the spitting image anyway.  Lying inert in the dust before them. \nWORF It's you. \nDATA The resemblance is... striking. \nA quiet beat. \nPICARD I'm going to miss you. \nDEANNA And I you. \nThey are interrupted by a comm signal: \nRIKER (V.O.) (ON COMM) Captain, you have an Alpha Priority communication from Starfleet Command. \nPICARD Acknowledged... (Deanna stands) ... I'll talk to Data \nDEANNA Thank you, sir. \nShe goes.  Picard activates his desktop viewscreen. \nADMIRAL KATHRYN JANEWAY appears on Picard's monitor.  Janeway is the former captain of Voyager.  Her new rank fits her well, she has lost none of her dry humor and down-to-earth charm which made her a household name and beloved cult figure. \nPICARD Admiral Janeway.  Good to see you. \nJANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN) Jean Luc... How'd you like a trip to Romulus?  All expenses paid? \nPICARD (smiles) With or without the rest of the fleet? \nJANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN) A diplomatic mission.  We've been invited, believe it or not.  Seems there's been some kind of internal political shakeup.  The new Praetor, someone called Shinzon, has requested a Federation envoy. \nPICARD New Praetor? \nJANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN) There's more... as always.  He's Reman. (Picard is surprised) Believe me, we don't understand it either.  You're the closest ship so I want you to high tail it over there and hear what he has to say. Get the lay of the land, If the Empire becomes unstable, it could mean trouble for the entire quadrant. \nPICARD Understood. \nJANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEEN) We're sending you all the intelligence we have, but it's not much.  I don't need to tell you to watch your back, Jean Luc. \nPICARD Not with the Romulans. \nJANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN) (smiles wryly) The Son'a, the Borg, the Romulans, the evil Soran and that pesky Nexus.  You seem to get all the easy assignments! \nPICARD Just lucky, Admiral. \nJANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN) Let's hope that luck holds. Janeway out. \nThe transmission ends. \nPicard sits for a moment, intrigued.  Then he goes to the bridge \nINT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING \nPicard goes to his command chair: \nPICARD (to Helm) Lay in a new course... Take us to Romulus.  Warp eight. \nThe crew is shocked. \nHELM OFFICER Aye aye, sir.  Course plotted and laid in... \nRIKER Romulus? \nPICARD I'm afraid the Opal Sea will have to wait, Number One... Engage. \nEXT.  ENTERPRISE - SPACE \nAnd the Enterprise jumps to high warp -- disappearing in a flash of dazzling light.  Yes! \nINT.  ENTERPRISE - OBSERVATION LOUNGE - DAY \nData conducts a briefing for the senior officers.  Monitors currently show an image of Romulus and Remus in orbit around their sun. \nDATA As you can see the habitable half of Remus is always in darkness because, like Mercury, one side always faces the sun.  Due to the extreme temperatures on that half of their world, the Remans live on the dark side of the planet. \nVarious grainy and unclear new images appear to illustrate Data's words: \nDATA Almost nothing is known about the Reman homeworld, although intelligence scans have proven the existence of dilithium mining and heavy weapons construction. \nVery obscure images of Remans appear, the crew can barely make out the monstrous figures: \nDATA The Remans themselves are considered an undesirable caste in the hierarchy of the Empire. \nRIKER But they also have the reputation of being formidable warriors.  In the Dominion War, Reman forces were used as assault troops in the most violent encounters. \nPICARD (grim) Cannon fodder. \nGEORDI Then how did a Reman get to be Praetor?  I don't get it. \nDATA But I believe he will prove incapable of performing higher functions. \nGEORDI Don't give up hope, Data.  I know, I know, you're not capable of hope. \nDATA (looking at B-9) I am not. \nData stands.  The B-9 stands to follow. \nDATA No, remain with Commander La Forge. He is going to try to make you well. \nThe B-9 sits.  Data goes.  Geordi watches him go. \nEXT.  ENTERPRISE - OVER ROMULUS - SPACE \nThe Enterprise is in orbit around Romulus.  Remus can be seen in the distance. \nPICARD (V.O.) Captain's Log.  Stardate 47844.9. The Enterprise has arrived at Romulus and is waiting at the designated coordinates.  All our hails have gone unanswered.  We've been waiting for seventeen hours. \nINT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING \nThe crew is tense.  Silence. \nWorf, at tactical, slowly stretches his neck.  Trying to release the tension.  It cracks.  Deanna jumps a bit. \nRIKER Why don't they answer our hails? \nPICARD It's an old psychological strategy, Number One.  To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy. \nRIKER It's working. \nPICARD (to Deanna) Counselor? \nDEANNA They're out there, sir. \nPicard stands and walks to the viewscreen.  He gazes at Romulus below and the black infinity of space beyond. They're out there, Waiting. \nWORF Sir,  I recommend we raise shields. \nPICARD Not yet, Mister Worf. \nRIKER Captain, with all due respect to diplomatic protocols -- the Federation Council's not sitting out here, we are. \nPICARD Patience.  Diplomacy is a very exacting occupation.  We can wait. \nDATA Captain... \nAnd on the viewscreen. \nShinzon's magnificent Reman Warbird, the SCIMITAR, decloaks directly before the Enterprise. \nEXT.  OVER ROMULUS - SPACE \nOur first sight of this incredible ship is absolutely breathtaking. \nShinzon's vessel combines the clean lines of the traditional Romulan Warbird with unique weaponry and styling.  It is huge, easily twice as large as the Enterprise.  And it is aggressive.  Awesome in its power. \nINT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING \nThe crew gapes at the huge ship on the viewscreen. \nRIKER (slowly rising from his chair) My God... \nWORF (tense) Should I raise shields? \nPICARD No! \nWORF Captain -- ! \nPICARD (firm) Tactical analysis, Mister Worf. \nWORF (quickly analyzing tactical display) Fifty-two disruptor banks, twenty- seven photon torpedo bays, primary and secondary phased shields. \nRIKER She's not out for a pleasure cruise. \nPICARD (grim) She's a predator. \nWORF We're being hailed. \nPICARD On screen. \nAnd the image on the viewscreen transforms to: \nShinzon's Viceroy. \nSHINZON (turning back to Picard) Yes, I'm sorry, Captain. (he smiles) There's so much we have to talk about. \nPICARD I would be interested to know what we are talking about. \nSHINZON Unity, Captain!  Tearing down the walls between us to recognize we are one people.  Federation and Romulan.  Human and Vulcan and Klingon and Reman.  I'm speaking of the thing that makes us the same. We want peace. \nPicard and the others are stunned. \nSHINZON I want to end the centuries of mistrust.  I want to be your ally, not your enemy.  As a first step I propose we eliminate the Neutral Zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas. \nPICARD And the Senate supports you? \nSHINZON (dry) I have dissolved the Senate. \nA beat. \nSHINZON Right now, you're thinking this all sounds too good to be true? \nPICARD Yes. \nSHINZON And you're wondering why the Scimitar is so well armed.  Is this the ship of a peacemaker?  Or a predator? (Picard is startled at Shinzon's choice of words) ... But you're also thinking the chance for peace is too promising to ignore.  Above all, you're trying to decide if you can trust me. \nPICARD Yes. \nSHINZON Then perhaps the time has come to add some illumination to our discussion.  Computer, raise lighting four levels. \nLights shoot up around the room. \nFor the first time the crew can see Shinzon clearly.  Picard actually gasps when he sees Shinzon's face.  The rest of the crew doesn't understand his reaction. \nSHINZON Allow me to tell you a story that I hope will clarify my position. When I was very young I was stricken with an odd disease.  I developed a hyper-sensitivity to sound.  The slightest whisper caused me agony... \nPicard watches him carefully.  Wary and strangely intense. \nSHINZON No one knew what to do.  Finally I was taken to a doctor who had some experience with Terran illnesses and I was finally diagnosed with Shalaft's syndrome.  Do you know of it, Captain? \nPICARD You know I do. \nThe crew is dumbfounded at Picard's unusual reaction. \nSHINZON Then you know it's a very rare syndrome.  Genetic.  All the male members of my family had it. Eventually I was treated.  Now I can hear as well as you can, Captain. \nHe steps toward Picard who holds his ground. \nSHINZON I can see as well as you can.  I can feel everything you feel. (He stops right before Picard) In fact, I feel exactly what you feel.  Don't I, Jean Luc? \nPicard stares at him with a mixture of realization and curiosity.  It is as if Picard is looking into a strange, remembered mirror: Shinzon's face is nearly identical to his at that age. \nSHINZON Do you trust me now? \nA beat. \nPICARD We need to talk, just you and I. \nSHINZON Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow. Just the two of us.  Or just the one of us. \nPICARD You know I need to verify this. \nSHINZON I know. \nThe crew is utterly confused.  Their confusion turns to outright shock when Shinzon calmly pulls out a Reman knife and cuts his arm, drawing a little blood.  He hands the knife to Data. \nSHINZON Tomorrow then, Captain.  We have so much to discuss. \nPicard touches his communicator pin: \nPICARD Picard to Enterprise.  Five to beam out. \nThey dematerialize, the shimmering glow illuminating Shinzon's features.  Picard's eyes never leave Shinzon as the transporter effect ripples around him. \nINT.  ENTERPRISE - SICKBAY - DAY \nBeverly stands with Picard, Riker and Deanna.  The Reman knife is under a protonmicroscope and other medical readouts and analysis are visible. \nBEVERLY There's no doubt, Captain.  Right down to your regressive strain of Shalaft's Syndrome.  He's a clone. \nA beat as the confirmation sinks in. \nPICARD When was he... created? \nBEVERLY About twenty-five years ago.  They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell. \nPICARD (touching head) I think a skin cell's the more likely of the two. \nPICARD Who was it? \nGEORDI It's going to take some time to find out -- the data stream was rerouted through substations all over the ship. \nPICARD What programs were accessed? \nGEORDI That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations.  It's not even restricted material. \nPICARD (to Worf) Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again, we want to be ready. \nGEORDI (grim) There's something else.  I was reviewing the sensor logs... (he refers to some readouts on his console) When the Scimitar decloaked there was a momentary spike in the tertiary EM band -- there -- You're not going to believe this but it's Thalaron. \nPicard is shocked. \nINT.  SICKBAY - NIGHT \nPicard stands, concerned, with Beverly, Geordi and Data. Monitors showing Thalaron research are visible. \nPICARD ... I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical. \nGEORDI Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up.  But he's got it, Captain. \nPICARD As I remember, Thalaron research was banned in the Federation because of its bioqenic properties. \nBEVERLY It has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level.  I can't overestimate the danger of Thalaron radiation, Jean Luc.  A microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds. \nPICARD Understood.  Keep on it.  I need to know what he has and how to neutralize any threat.  Give me options. \nPicard goes.  Data thinks for a moment. \nDATA Doctor, will you excuse us for a moment?  Geordi, please come with me. \nHe and Geordi head out.  Beverly returns to some medical displays showing Thalaron research, her expression deeply concerned. \nINT.  ENTERPRISE - PICARD'S CABIN - NIGHT \nPicard is sitting at his desk, flipping through an old photo album.  He stops and stares at one of the pictures deeply troubled.  We finally see the photo: Young Jean Luc Picard. A serious, unsmiling cadet at Starfleet Academy.  The face before him bears a disturbing resemblance to Shinzon. \nThe door comm chirps. \nPICARD Come... (Beverly enters) ... Beverly, come in. \nBEVERLY You're working late. \nShe sits, notes the picture of Young Jean Luc. \nPICARD Remember him? \nBEVERLY He was a bit proud as I recall. \nPICARD He was a damn fool.  Selfish and ambitious.  Very much in need of seasoning. \nBEVERLY He turned out all right. \nHe rises, goes to a window, gazes at the Scimitar in the distance.  A beat. \nPICARD I so wanted to believe Shinzon. But the Thalaron radiation can't be explained away.  Whatever he's after, it's not peace. \nBEVERLY Is he very much like you were? \nPICARD Yes. \nData interrupts on comm: \nDATA (V.O.) (ON COMM) Data to Captain Picard.  Geordi and I have identified the source of the unauthorized computer access.  And, I believe, we have also discovered an opportunity to gain a tactical advantage. \nPICARD (to comm) On my way... \nBEVERLY (stands) Jean Luc -- whatever you were -- right now you're the man you've made yourself.  He's someone else. \nPICARD I wish I could believe that, Doctor. \nHe goes. \nINT.  ENTERPRISE - TURBOLIFT - MORNING \nDeanna is alone on the turbolift.  Then a voice makes her spin: \nSHINZON (V.O.) Imzadi... \nShinzon stands across from her. \nDEANNA You're not here. \nPICARD (gently) Can you describe it, Deanna? \nShe looks at Picard, tears in her eyes. \nDEANNA It was... a violation. \nRiker takes her hand. \nDEANNA (with difficulty) Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts. I've become a liability... I request to be relieved of my duties. \nPICARD Permission denied.  If you can possibly endure any more of these assaults.  I need you at my side. Now more than ever I... \nBut before the words are out of his mouth... he begins to dematerialize! \nRIKER (to comm) Worf!  Raise Shields ! \nBut Picard is gone. \nEXT.  OVER ROMULUS - SPACE \nThe Scimitar cloaks. \nINT.  SCIMITAR - BRIG - NIGHT \nPicard stands in the Reman brig.  His communicator pin has been removed. \nBeyond the security force field a ghoulish medical apparatus is being prepared.  A metal chair with laser scalpels, IV tubes and hyposprays connected to it.  Reman doctors work over the mysterious chair. \nShinzon enters with the B-9 following.  Shinzon stands on the other side of the force field. \nPicard notices something immediately.  Tiny veins are now visible on Shinzon's face; the faintest sign of an intricate spider-web pattern of pale blue veins. \nSHINZON Hello, Jean Luc. \nPICARD Why am I here? \nSHINZON I was lonely... (he realizes Picard is staring at the veins on his face) Perhaps I'm not aging as well as you did. \nHe nods to a guard.  The guard deactivates the force field. A Reman doctor enters and raises a hypospray toward Picard. \nPICARD (resists) What are you doing? \nSHINZON I need a sample of your blood. What do your Borg friends say? Resistance is futile. (maniacal laugh) \nThe Doctor takes a quick sample of Picard's blood as Picard glances to the B-9. \nSHINZON Yes.  The bait you couldn't refuse. I learned there might be an existing prototype from a Cardassian historian, then went to a great deal of trouble to find it and scatter it about on Kolarus III.  I knew it would pique your curiosity and conveniently make the Enterprise the closest ship to Romulus when I contacted Starfleet. \nThe Reman doctor leaves the cell.  The force field is reactivated.  The doctor goes to the mysterious medical apparatus and analyzes Picard's blood.  As: \nPICARD All of this so you could capture me? \nSHINZON Don't be so vain.  After we found it, we made a few modifications. An extra memory port, a hidden transponder.  Perhaps your eyes will be a bit less confident when you learn I've gained access to Starfleet's communications protocols.  I now know the location of your entire fleet... (to B-9) ... You may go. \nB-9 Where? \nSHINZON Out of my sight. \nThe B-9 obediently leaves the room as: \nSHINZON Maybe I'll train it to do little tricks for me like your robot does. Or maybe I'll snap its ugly head off. \nPICARD What's this all about? \nSHINZON It's about destiny, Picard.  About a Reman outcast who -- \nPICARD You're not Reman. \nSHINZON And I'm not quite human.  So what am I?  What do you see? (he peers at Picard deeply) Do you see a life you might have led?  Lost youth never to be recaptured? \nPICARD I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is. \nSHINZON I see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be. \nPICARD I won't defend my life to you. \nSHINZON My life is meaningless as long as you're alive.  What am I while you exist?  A shadow?  An enigma? \nPICARD (stern) If your issues are with me... This has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the Federation. \nSHINZON Oh, but it does.  We will no longer bow like slaves before anyone.  Not the Romulans and not your mighty Federation.  We're a race bred for war.  For conquest. \nPICARD Think about what you're doing, Shinzon.  Are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons? \nThe Viceroy continues away down the corridor.  The B-9 leads Picard along. \nPICARD (whispers) Be careful of over-playing your part, Commander! \nAnd the audience now realizes it is Data pretending to be the B-9 and rejoices. \nDATA Sorry, sir.  I thought it added a touch of reality to the performance. \nThey are silent as they pass a few Reman guards.  Then: \nDATA My mission was a success, sir.  I have discovered the source of the Thalaron radiation. \nPICARD Good work.  The download? \nDATA He believes he has our communications protocols.  But they will give him inaccurate locations for all Starfleet vessels. \nData assumes the B-9's posture again as they pass some some Reman Warriors. \nDATA Move, puny human animal. \nThey pass the Warriors. \nPICARD A bit less florid, Data. \nDATA Aye, sir... This way. \nHe leads Picard down the corridor. \nINT.  SCIMITAR - GENERATION CHAMBER - NIGHT \nData leads Picard into a massive chamber that soars up like a cathedral.  It is the size of a small town. \nThe whole, cavernous chamber pulses with glowing green light. \nDATA This entire ship is, essentially, a flying Thalaron generator. (he points up) All its power relays lead to that device. \nHigh above them, at the very top of the chamber, is a gigantic version of the spider-weapon we saw kill all the Romulan Senators before.  It is breathtaking. \nPICARD A weapon. \nDATA It would appear so. \nData rotates his left hand and then slides it forward, exposing a hidden compartment in his wrist.  He removes a small, silver disc.  This is a cool new piece of Federation technology called an ETU.  (Emergency Transport Unit.) \nDATA Geordi equipped me with the prototype for the Emergency Transport Unit.  I recommend you use it to return to the Enterprise. \nPICARD It'll only work for one of us. \nDATA Yes, sir. \nPICARD We'll find a way off together. Recommendations? \nDATA There is a shuttlebay 948 meters from our current location. \nData inserts the ETU back into his wrist and they leave the chamber. \nINT.  SCIMITAR BRIDGE - NIGHT \nThe Viceroy arrives on the bridge, stops. \nVICEROY Where's Picard? \nShinzon looks at him, confused. \nINT.  SCIMITAR - CORRIDORS - NIGHT \nSecurity alert klaxons suddenly begin to howl and harsh Reman commands are broadcast through the corridors. \nDATA This way, sir! \nThey sprint down the twisting, dark corridors -- Reman warriors suddenly appear before them! -- Data fires the disruptor as Picard launches himself into them -- \nA fight -- Picard uses a dazzlinq series of Starfleet hand- to-hand maneuvers -- he dramatically subdues the Remans. \nMore Reman warriors appear down the corridor.  Picard grabs a disruptor. \nAnd instantly spins to fire a blazing disruptor.  A battle breaks out in the corridor -- the energy beams and explosions illuminating the violent fire fight in strobe-like bursts. \nThey run to another corridor and finally arrive at the shuttlebay door -- it does not open. \nDATA (looking at door security panel) It seems to have an encrypted security system. \nReman warriors are closing in on them. \nEXT.  OVER ROMULUS - SPACE \nThe Scorpion seems to appear from nowhere -- slicing through the cloak of invisibility around the Scimitar -- \nINT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING \nThe crew sees the Scorpion appear on the viewscreen. \nRIKER Worf!  Lock on transporters! \nINT.  SCIMITAR BRIDGE - FOLLOWING \nShinzon sees the Scorpion as well. \nSHINZON Tractor beam!  Now! \nEXT.  OVER ROMULUS - SPACE \nBut they are too late -- the Scorpion dematerializes -- \nINT.  ENTERPRISE - CARGO BAY - FOLLOWING \nAnd materializes in one of the Enterprise's cargo bays. Picard and Data climb out -- \nPICARD (to comm) Number One, emergency warp! \nEXT.  OVER ROMULUS - FOLLOWING \nThe Enterprise dramatically powers forward and up -- rolling over in a great arc going into warp while still upside down. It disappears in a blaze of light.  Fade to... \nINT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - NIGHT \nShinzon sits in his command chair as the ship streaks through space.  He speaks on viewscreen with his Romulan collaborators.  His face is even more finely veined now. \nSHINZON The Enterprise is immaterial!  They won't make it back to Federation space. \nSURAN (ON VIEWSCREEN) (angry) This has gone far enough! \nSHINZON I thought we discussed patience, Commander. \nSURAN (ON VIEWSCREEN) And mine is wearing thin, young man!  We supported you because you promised action.  And yet you delay and you waste your time playing games with Picard while -- \nShinzon stands and briskly pulls down his uniform tunic exactly as we've seen Picard do a thousand times. \nSHINZON Commander Suran, the games are over.  In two days the Federation will be crippled beyond repair. Does that satisfy you? \nSURAN (ON VIEWSCREEN) (grim) For the moment. \nSHINZON (brutal) And when I return... you and I shall have a little talk about showing proper respect! \nINT.  ROMULAN SENATE - CHAMBER - FOLLOWING \nThe viewscreen picture of Shinzon snaps out.  The Romulan sit for a silent beat. \nDONATRA Does anyone in this room harbor any illusions about what he means by \"showing proper respect\"? \nTAL'AURA What's happening to his face? \nSURAN I want opinions.  He is clearly out of his mind. \nSURAN But can he complete his mission? \nDONATRA Should he? \nThey look at her. \nDONATRA Are you prepared to have your hands drenched in blood?  He'll show them no mercy.  And his sins will mark us all for generations.  Is that what you truly want, Romulans? \nA beat. \nDONATRA I think you should consider that question now -- or else you may have a lifetime to think about it in the dilithium mines. \nShe turns and stalks out. \nINT.  ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM - NIGHT \nBeverly sits with Picard and Riker. \nBEVERLY The more I studied his DNA the more confusing it got.  Finally I could only come to one conclusion... Shinzon was created with temporal RNA sequencing.  He was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly, so he could replace you. \nPICARD But the Romulans abandoned the plan... \nBEVERLY As a result the temporal sequencing was never activated.  Remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age.  He was engineered to skip thirty years of life.  But since the RNA sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down.  He's dying. \nPICARD And the Romulans invade. \nDEANNA How can you be certain? \nPICARD I know how he thinks. \nA beat. \nRIKER (to Geordi) And there's no way to penetrate his cloak? \nGEORDI No, sir. \nRIKER (frustrated) He could pass within 10 meters of every ship in Starfleet and they'd never know. \nBEVERLY But we do have one advantage. (to Picard) He needs your blood to live.  He might come after you first. \nPICARD I'm counting on it... We've been ordered to head to sector 3274. Starfleet is diverting the fleet to meet us there. \nRIKER Strength in numbers? \nPICARD We can only hope so. \nA beat as he looks at them gravely. \nPICARD He can't be allowed to use that weapon.  All other concerns are secondary.  Do you understand me? \nRiker knows exactly what Picard is saying: the Enterprise is expendable. \nRIKER Yes, sir. \nPicard stands.  Presses a comm button. \nPICARD All hands.  Battle stations. \nINT.  ENTERPRISE - VARIOUS ANGLES \nWe see a montage of the Enterprise preparing for battle. \nCrew members assume battle stations.  Weapons locker ring open and Security Officers hand out sidearms and phaser rifles. \nGeordi and his Engineers establish emergency force field around the warp core. \nRiker and Worf brief officers on tactical plans... \nData works at the bridge Science Station, analyzing data on Shinzon's ship. \nPicard walks through the corridors, he stops to talk with apprehensive young ensign. \nAs we hear: \nPICARD (V.O.) Captain's Personal Log. Supplemental.  We're heading toward Federation space at maximum warp. The crew has responded with the dedication I've come to expect of them.  And like a thousand other commanders on a thousand other battlefields throughout history, I wait for the dawn. \nThe montage ends as... \nINT.  ENTERPRISE - SICKBAY - NIGHT \nPicard enters sickbay. \nDr. Crusher and her medical staff are hard at work.  They position anti-grav gurneys and ready medical supplies. Security officers are handing out phasers. \nPicard watches the grim preparations.  Beverly goes to him, bolstering her phaser. \nPICARD (quietly) To seek out new life and new civilizations.  Zephyr Cochran's own words.  When Charles Darwin set out on the H.M.S. Beagle, on his journey into the unknown... he sailed without a single musket. \nBEVERLY (gently) That was another time. \nPICARD How far we've come.  Let me know if you need anything. \nHe starts to go -- \nBEVERLY Jean Luc... (he stops) ... He is not you. \nA beat. \nPICARD What makes us who we are, Doctor? Can you tell me that? \nShe watches him go. \nINT.  SCIMITAR BRIDGE - NIGHT \nShinzon sits in his command chair, lined with veins now. His Viceroy again has his hand pressed to Shinzon's chest. \nSHINZON How long? \nThe Bassen Rift is a strange area of electromagnetic distortion.  Energy patterns crackle through space. \nINT.  SCIMITAR BRIDGE - FOLLOWING \nShinzon sits in his command chair.  The viewscreen shows the Enterprise before him. \nSHINZON Target weapons systems and shields. I don't want the Enterprise destroyed. \nOn the viewscreen, we see disruptor blasts streaking from the Scimitar -- slicing into the Enterprise. \nSHINZON Can you learn to see in the dark, Captain? \nINT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING \nPicard and Data emerge from the turbolift as the ship ROCKS -- \nPICARD Report. \nRIKER He's firing through his cloak.  We can't get a lock. \nGEORDI (at engineering station) He disabled our warp drive with his first shot.  We've only got impulse. \nWORF Long range communication is impossible as long as we're in the rift -- \nThe ship SHUDDERS again -- \nPICARD Worf, prepare a full phaser spread, zero elevation.  All banks on my mark.  Scan for shield impacts and stand by photon torpedoes. \nWORF Aye, sir \nThe ship ROCKS again. \nPICARD Fire! \nEXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE \nThe Enterprise fires her phasers simultaneously -- the energy beams shoot into space -- \nAnd the Scimitar's shape is momentarily illuminated as one of its shields is hit. \nPhoton torpedoes immediately shoot from the Enterprise -- but pass harmlessly through the area where the Scimitar's shields were momentarily illuminated. \nINT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING \nSHINZON You're too slow, old man. (entering commands in his chair console) Attack pattern Shinzon Theta. \nEXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE \nThe invisible Warbird makes a dramatic run straight over the Enterprise -- firing steadily down as it sweeps past it; is a brutal, close range assault -- \nINT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING \nThe bridge SHAKES violently under the ruthless attack-- \nDATA We are losing dorsal shields -- \nPICARD Full axis rotation to port!  Fire all ventral phasers! \nEXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE \nThe Enterprise instantly complies -- Rolling completely over to the left, firing phasers up as Shinzon's invisible ship streaks above it -- \nA few lucky phaser shots from the bottom of the Enterprise -- now shooting upward -- manage to momentarily illuminate the bottom shields of the Scimitar as it sweeps past above. \nINT.  ENTERPRISE BRIDGE - FOLLOWING \nWORF Minimal damage to the Scimitar. \nRIKER (to Helm) Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon. Geordi, get those shields online. \nPICARD (to comm) Counselor Troi, report to the bridge. \nRIKER Unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark. \nPlCARD Agreed. \nWORF Sir, we're being hailed. \nPICARD On screen. \nShinzon appears on the viewscreen.  He is on the bridge of the Scimitar. \nSHINZON (ON VIEWSCREEN) Captain Picard, will you join me in your Ready Room? \nSHINZON I'll show you my true nature.  Your nature.  And as Earth dies -- remember that I'm forever Shinzon of Remus!  And my voice will echo through time long after yours has faded to a dim memory. \nShinzon ends the transmission and his holographic image flickers and fades away. \nPicard stands alone, drained. \nINT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING \nShinzon strides quickly to his command chair, barking to his Viceroy: \nSHINZON Disable their weapons! \nBut before the Viceroy can move the Scimitar suddenly ROCKS -- attacked from somewhere!  Shinzon is stunned. \nSHINZON Report! \nREMAN OFFICER Two ships decloaking, sir! Romulan! \nINT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING \nPicard strides to his command chair as two Romulan Warbirds appear on the viewscreen.  Deanna is now on the bridge. \nRIKER Believe it or not, I think the cavalry has arrived. \nWORF We're being hailed. \nPICARD On screen. \nOn the viewscreen: Commander Donatra shimmers into view. \nDONATRA (ON VIEWSCREEN) Captain Picard, Commander Donatra of the Warbird Valdore.  Might we be of assistance? \nPICARD Your timing is impeccable, Commander. \nDONATRA (ON VIEWSCREEN) The Empire considers this a matter of internal security.  We regret you've become involved. \nPICARD When this is over, I owe you a drink. \nOn the viewscreen, the Valdore ROCKS from a disruptor blast. \nDONATRA (ON VIEWSCREEN) Romulan ale, Captain.  Let's get to work.  Valdore out. \nThe transmission ends. \nPICARD (to Worf) You heard the lady.  Get to work. Move your ass! \n(The Romulan Warbirds must remain decloaked to fire weapons and are visible throughout the battle.) \nAlthough Shinzon's ship is still cloaked, the steady barrage of triangulated phaser and disruptor fire from the Enterprise and the two Romulan vessels illuminate its shields with impacts. \nINT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING \nPICARD (to Worf) Coordinate our attack with the Valdore's tactical officer. Triangulate fire on any shield impacts. \nWORF Aye, sir. \nThe Enterprise ROCKS from a photon torpedo impact -- \nDATA Aft shields are down to forty percent. \nRIKER (to Helm) Keep our bow to the Scimitar. Auxiliary power to forward shields. \nINT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING \nShinzon sits quite calmly in his command chair. \nSHINZON Target the flanking Warbird.  All forward disruptor banks on my mark. \nEXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE \nIt is a chaos of starships as the Enterprise and the two Warbirds fire steadily -- illuminating the Scimitar's shields. \nThe ships sweep around one another, maneuvering for position, firing constantly.  The battlefield seems impossibly crowded as the four vessels evade and attack; as phaser and disruptor beams criss-cross space. \nThen the Scimitar unleashes a devastating volley... all her forward disruptor banks fire at once -- \nThey literally cut one of the Romulan ships in half -- a huge EXPLOSION -- debris SHOOTS across space and SLAMS VIOLENTLY off the Enterprise's forward shields -- ! \nINT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING \nThe ship ROCKS dangerously! \nDATA Forward shields are down to ten percent. \nShe quickly goes to Worf at tactical. \nINT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - NIGHT \nShinzon is entering tactical commands in his chair console. \nSHINZON Prepare a lateral run -- all starboard disruptors. \nThen the viceroy suddenly stiffens, alarm in his eyes -- \nVICEROY No! \nINT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING \nDeanna concentrates furiously, eyes closed.  She stands with Worf, her hand slowly moving his over the photon torpedo targeting display. \nIt is a wrenching experience as she probes with her thoughts. \nDEANNA He's resisting me. \nShe is in pain. \nINT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING \nThe Viceroy concentrates, trying to block her probing thoughts. \nSHINZON What is it?!  Focus on your job!!! \nVICEROY She is here. \nINT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING \nDeanna continues to move Worf's hand over the targeting display.  She is sweating, panting for breath, concentrating fiercely. \nINT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING \nThe Viceroy resists her -- their psyches lock in battle. Deanna appears in the Viceroy's mind, she glares at him. \nDEANNA Remember me? \nINT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING \nHer eyes snap open -- \nDEANNA NOW! \nWorf instantly fires a full volley of photon torpedoes. \nEXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE \nA full spread of photon torpedoes shoot through space. \nAnd connect!  A series of devastating impacts -- and the Scimitar's cloak fails! \nINT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING \nPicard stands quickly. \nPICARD Savage them! \nEXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE \nAnd the Enterprise attacks! \nIt fires all weapons simultaneously -- phasers and photon torpedoes slam into the Scimitar!  Shinzon's ship responds quickly -- maneuvering for position and returning fire! \nINT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING \nThe bridge has been damaged, sparks sputter through the darkness and debris litters the deck. \nShinzon eyes reflect a growing sense of desperation. \nSHINZON (spinning to his Viceroy) Prepare a boarding party -- BRING ME PICARD! \nThe viceroy strides out as Shinzon spins to another officer. \nSHINZON Get the cloak back!  And target shield coordinates beta three.  All disruptors.  Fire! \nOn the viewscreen, we see disruptor beams focusing on a tiny part of the Enterprise's lower shields, slamming into them. \nINT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - NIGHT \nDATA Captain, we have lost ventral shielding on deck twenty nine. \nShinzon, supremely confident, leans back in his command chair. \nSHINZON Open a channel. \nINT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING \nPicard is still entering commands in his chair console. \nDATA We are being hailed. \nPICARD Deanna, stand by. (to Data) Open a channel. \nSHINZON (V.O.) I hope you're still alive, Jean Luc. \nPICARD I am. \nSHINZON (V.O.) Don't you think it's time to surrender?  I'll have my cloak back in a matter of minutes and your poor ship is shot to pieces.  Why should the rest of your crew have to die? \nPicard continues to enter command codes -- transmits them to Deanna at helm -- she receives the commands, nods.  All of this as Picard buys some time: \nPICARD I never told you about my first Academy evaluation, did I?  I received very high marks for my studies.  But I was found lacking in certain other areas. Personality traits, you might say. In particular I was thought to be extremely... (he glares up at the prow of the Scimitar) ... over-confident. \nPicard indicates for Data to end the communication.  Then: \nPICARD (quickly) Geordi, put 211 power to the engines.  Take it from life support if you have to -- everything you can give me. \nGEORDI Aye, sir. \nPICARD Deanna, on my mark. \nGEORDI Ready, sir! \nPicard leans forward in his chair: \nPICARD (on comm) All hands, brace for impact! (to Deanna) ENGAGE. \nEXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE \nThe Enterprise powers forward in a final thrust -- ! \nINT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING \nShinzon sees it coming -- utterly shocked -- bolts up -- \nSHINZON HARD TO PORT ! \nToo late. \nEXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE \nA massive COLLISION as the Enterprise SLAMS into the Scimitar -- as it SMASHES and GRINDS into Shinzon's ship -- \nThe Scimitar REELS -- \nINT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING \nEveryone goes FLYING! \nEXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE \nThe two great ships are now locked together, slowly rotating in space. \nThe forward part of the Enterprise's saucer is enmeshed in Shinzon's ship; two scorpions with their claws locked. \nINT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING \nShinzon stands in the ruins of his bridge.  Many of his bridge crew are now dead. \nSHINZON Divert all power to engines.  Full reverse! \nEXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE \nEvery part of the Enterprise ROCKS -- a great lurch as the Scimitar begins to tear itself free -- backing away -- a deafening shriek of metal -- both ships are being torn to pieces in the process -- but it is working -- the Scimitar is ripping free, wrenching itself loose. \nINT.  ENTERPRISE - JEFFERIES TUBES - FOLLOWING \nThe Jefferies tube SHUDDERS as the Scimitar continues to tear itself free -- Riker and the Viceroy careen through the tube. The Viceroy recovers quickly and coils for a final attack. Riker sees that an access plate has been loosened in the collision -- he desperately rips it away -- knowing the relays behind will provide him with the advantage he needs -- \nBright light strobes from the relays and the Viceroy is momentarily blinded -- Riker uses this opportunity to attack! He dives forward -- slamming into the Viceroy -- they both tumble into a long, vertical access tunnel -- they fall! \nRiker shoots out a hand and grabs a ladder -- the Viceroy, grabs onto Riker, his talons digging into his uniform -- a long drop below them! \nRiker forces the Viceroy's head back -- away from him -- a brutal struggle -- \nDEANNA Let him go. \nPicard powers up the phaser rifle as: \nPICARD (to Data) You have the bridge, Commander. Use all available power to move away from the Scimitar. (to Geordi) Now, Mister La Forge. \nGEORDI Aye, sir. \nGeordi nervously works some controls on his console and Picard dematerializes.  Then the transporter panel explodes in a shower of sparks. \nGEORDI That's it.  Transporters are down. \nData thinks for a moment.  Then: \nDATA Counsellor Troi, please assume command.  Geordi, if you will come with me. \nHe heads toward the turbolift, Geordi following. \nINT.  SCIMITAR - CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nSeveral Remen warriors in the corridor turn and fire.  Riker returns fire, a series of lightning fast pulses from his phaser rifle. \nINT.  ENTERPRISE - FORWARD CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nData and Geordi stand in a long corridor.  The far end of the corridor opens to space.  An emergency force field is in place at the end of the corridor. \nGeordi operates a tricorder and another force field flickers on around him. \nData looks toward the end of the corridor, readying himself. \nDATA What is our approximate distance? \nGEORDI (scans with tricorder) 400 meters. \nDATA Thank you. \nData backs up a little more   He looks at Geordi again. Deeply. \nDATA Thank you, Geordi.  Deactivate the field. \nGeordi operates his tricorder and the force field at the end of the corridor snaps off -- \nThe void of space fills the corridor and Data takes a running start -- he races down the long corridor and leaps -- \nEXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE \n-- into space. \nHe floats toward the Scimitar, his momentum carrying him. Carrying him too far! \nHe is going to miss the Scimitar -- almost past it now!  He thrusts out a hand -- \nAnd just misses a piece of dangling wreckage!  Data is floating helplessly through space.  Doomed.  Then he SLAMS into an invisible piece of the partially cloaked on the ship! \nHe grabs onto the invisible part of the ship and pulls himself up to the hull.  He rips open an access panel with his superior strength and climbs inside. \nINT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - NIGHT \nShinzon stands, his eyes glued to the Enterprise on the viewscreen. \nWe see a monitor showing that the Cascading Pulse weapon is locked on the Enterprise. \nMost of the light on the shattered bridge now comes from the three steadily pulsing warp core relays which soar up through the floor. \nCOMPUTER (V.O) Forty-seven.  Forty six... \nSuddenly -- a MASSIVE BLAST as the doors to the bridge explode in.  Shinzon spins to see -- \nPicard framed in the doorway, phaser rifle ready. \nPicard instantly fires for the Cascading Pulse control -- but Shinzon dives to cover it -- the phaser blast hits Shinzon in the chest -- he recoils, slamming to the deck, stunned. \nThe few remaining Remans on the bridge spin to Picard, firing disruptors -- Picard dives for cover and battles them with his phaser rifle -- \nHe succeeds in stunning the Remans but a final disruptor blast knocks Picard to the deck -- the phaser rifle spins away -- \nCOMPUTER (V.O.) Twenty nine... Twenty eight... \nShinzon pulls himself up and races to snatch up a disruptor from a fallen comrade -- \nAs Picard leaps up, grabbing a piece of wreckage, a long metal rod -- Picard thrusts it forward like a spear -- \nImpaling Shinzon. \n", "test1_input": "DATA Because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle. \nHEAD Why? \nPICARD Data! \nDATA Sorry, sir. \nThey continue to speed over the landscape -- bouncing and flying over natural rises in the terrain -- trying to evade their pursuers -- \nPicard puts the pedal to the metal and races through the alien vehicles -- weaving in and out, avoiding their fire -- Worf blasts away with the phaser cannon -- an exhilarating adventure -- \nFinally they are within sight of the Argo -- but they see it is surrounded by more of the aliens! \nPICARD Mister Data.  Let's make like the wind. \nData punches some buttons on a dashboard console -- and the Argo LIFTS OFF by remote control -- \nData uses the console to swing the Argo around and lower the rear cargo doors -- it hovers over the surface -- \nPicard floors the jeep -- using a natural rise in the terrain as a ramp -- the jeep FLIES THROUGH THE AIR -- over the aliens -- and into the cargo bay -- \nINT.  ARGO - CARGO BAY - FOLLOWING \nPicard slams on the brakes -- the jeep screeches to a stop as the doors shut and the Argo shoots into the air. \nPicard climbs from the jeep.  He nonchalantly rubs a bit of dirt from the hood and then disappears into the main cabin. \nData and Worf remain in the jeep for a beat, stunned. \nWORF (smiles) He must have Klingon blood. \nINT.  ENTERPRISE - ENGINEERING LAB - DAY \nBeverly gazes at the android head.  It gazes back at her. \nBEVERLY I think you have nicer eyes. \nWe pull back to reveal she is speaking to Data.  Data stands with Picard, Riker and Geordi. \nDATA Our eyes are identical, Doctor. \nThe android is in a framework rig that holds the various body parts in place.  The parts are not yet assembled \nRIKER Geordi? \nGEORDI (at work analyzing the torso section) Well, he seems to have the same internal mechanics as Data but not as much positronic development. The neural pathways aren't nearly as sophisticated.  I'd say he's a prototype.  Something Dr. Soong created before Data. \nDATA (to head) Do you have a name, sir? \nHEAD I am the B-9. \nPICARD Be-nign.  Dr. Soong's penchant for whimsical names seems to have no end. \nHEAD (to Riker) You have a fuzzy face. \nPICARD (trying to ignore the head) Keep me informed, Number One, and, please, put him back together. \nHe goes.  Geordi and Data begin to reassemble the B-9 piece by piece like the Tin Man as: \nDATA Can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you? \nB-9 (blandly) I was taken from my homeworld by people called the \"PakJeds.\" They are fat.  They traded me to a ship belonging to the \"Bolians.\" The \"Bolians\" are blue.  They put me in a seat and asked me questions. Then they were attacked by another ship... \nTime passes... \nAnd still the B-9 is yammering blandly away.  He is more fully assembled   By this time Beverly is thoroughly bored. \nB-9 Then people called the Delviciansans picked me up.  They have long teeth.  They asked if I do anything to help them.  I told them I could do whatever they wanted.  They asked me to clean out the matrix manifolds.  I told them I did not know what an Matrix manifold looks like. \nBEVERLY Excuse me.  I have some diagnostics to run on some medical scanner things. \nShe quickly exits. \nB-9 And after they showed me the \"engine manifolds.\" Then they showed me something called a \"plasma mop\" \nTime passes... \nAnd still the B-9 is yammering away.  He is almost completely assembled by now.  Riker is bored out of his mind. \nB-9 ... then the \"Cardassians\" put me into something called a \"garbage chute\" and I went out into space again -- \nWORF (V.O.) (ON COMM) Worf to Commander Riker.  I have the tactical manifests ready, sir. \n", "test1_true": "He escapes. \nB-9 Fuzzy face is gone. \nDATA Yes, please continue. \nB-9 I was in space for a long time. Then a ship belonging to the \"Talosians\" picked me up.  They asked me where I came from.  I told them people called the \"Pakleds\" took me from my homeworld.  They are fat... \nGeordi groans. \nTime passes... \nAnd still the B-9 is yammering away.  By this time Geordi is slumped in a chair and only Data is listening.  The B-9 is fully assembled. \nB-9 Then I opened my eyes and saw you. \nA beat.  The B-9 is finally done with his tale... \nDATA Do you know who I am? \nB-9 You are me. \nDATA No.  My name is Data... I am your brother. \nINT.  ENTERPRISE - CREW LOUNGE - NIGHT \nRiker and Deanna are having dinner with Worf. \nDEANNA (to Worf) ... and after the ceremony on Betazed, three entire weeks for our honeymoon. \nRIKER We're going sailing on the Opal Sea.  We've booked an old-fashioned solar catamaran.  Just us and the sun and the waves. \nWORF It seems a very... soft honeymoon. \nDEANNA (amused) It's meant to be relaxing. \nWORF A Klingon honeymoon begins with the Kholamar desert march where the couple bonds in endurance trials. If they survive the challenge they move on to the Fire Caves of Fek'lhr to face the demons of Gre'thor. \nRIKER Well, that sounds relaxing too. \nWORF It is... invigorating. \nThey see Data enter the lounge, carefully leading the B-9. \nRIKER So they've got him up and running. \nWORF He's a very unusual android \nRIKER (smiles) Runs in the family. \nThey watch as Data leads the B-9 to a table.  Data instructs him to sit.  The B-9 sits and stares forward placidly.  Data shows him how use a napkin. \nA note of concern passes over Deanna's face as she watches Data and the B-9. \nThere is something strangely poignant in the twin androids. One a bundle of curiosity and intelligence; the other somewhat like a slow, simple child. \nINT.  ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM - NIGHT \nPicard is at his replicator unit. \nPICARD Earl Grey, hot. \nA cup of tea appears.  He takes it as the door chime sounds. \nPICARD Come. (Deanna enters) Counselor. \nDEANNA Do you have a moment, sir? \nPICARD Of course, sit down. \nHe sits at his desk  She sits across from him. \nDEANNA It's about Data  I've watched him with the B-9 and I'm troubled. Data's desire for a \"family\" is very strong.  I'm afraid he may be investing too much in the B-9. \nPICARD You're speaking of emotional investment? \nDEANNA The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian.  I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences.  He'll be disappointed when the B-9 cannot meet those expectations. \nPICARD As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment. \nDEANNA I don't believe that, sir.  We've shared many disappointing journeys. \n", "test1_id": 2631, "test2_input": "Heavy drapes are drawn against any hint of the sun.  Shinzon is in conference with the Romulan Commanders and Senator Tal'Aura.  Commander Donatra watches him closely. \nCommander Suran is angry, pacing.  Shinzon stands.  His Viceroy lurks in a corner. \nSURAN ... then I don't understand the reason for the delay! \nSHINZON You don't have to understand. \nSURAN And bringing the Enterprise here?! What possible purpose could that serve?! \nSHINZON I have a purpose. \nSURAN Then perhaps you will enlighten us? \nSHINZON (snaps) Silence, Romulan! \nA tense beat.  Shinzon regains his composure. \nSHINZON You must learn patience, Commander. Do you know where I learned it?  In the dilithium mines of Remus. Spend eighteen hours every day under the lash of a Romulan guard's whip and you'll soon understand patience. \nSURAN (carefully bows his head) Praetor. \nSHINZON Now go.  I have some personal business. \nSuran and the others go. \nDonatra turns just as she is leaving the chamber, she sees the Viceroy going to Shinzon.  And then do something odd. The Viceroy puts his hand on Shinzon's chest, leans very close and talks to him quietly.  This is an ancient form of Reman telepathic medical diagnosis. \nThis strange sight perplexes Donatra.  The doors close, blocking her view... \nINT.  SENATE - CORRIDOR - FOLLOWING \nWe go with Donatra and the other Romulans.  Donatra speaks quietly to Suran: \nDONATRA How long before he has us in the dilithium mines? \nINT.  ENTERPRISE - DATA'S CABIN - DAY \nThe B-9 sits placidly in a chair, staring forward. \nThen, as if a switch was thrown, he moves.  He quickly rises and goes to a computer console.  He efficiently starts punching in commands at an amazing velocity. \nINT.  ROMULAN SENATE CHAMBER - NIGHT \nPicard and Shinzon sit alone in a corner of the sweeping Senate chamber.  The remains of dinner before them. \nSHINZON And when I was ready they were going to replace you with me, an exact biological duplicate.  Put a Romulan agent at the heart of Starfleet to influence your command structure.  It was a bold plan. \nPICARD What happened? \nSHINZON As happens so frequently here on Romulus, a new government came to power.  They decided to abandon the plan -- frankly, I think they were afraid I'd be discovered and it would lead to war.  They weren't ready for that. \nPicard pours a glass of Romulan ale. \nSHINZON Romulan ale -- I'm surprised.  I can't stand it. \nPICARD (smiles) You'll acquire a taste for it. \nA beat.  They look at each other. \nSHINZON It's not quite the face you remember. \nPICARD Not quite.  I envy the hairline. \nSHINZON A lifetime of violence will do that.  My nose was broken four times.  And my jaw... But so much is the same.  The eyes, you recognize the eyes. \nPICARD Yes.  The eyes have it. \nSHINZON Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they?  Yours are so confident. \nPICARD How did you end up on Remus? \nSHINZON They sent me there to die.  How could a mere human survive the dilithium mines?  It was... (he can't find the words) ... I was a slave.  And a monster. The only thing the Romulan guards hated more than the Remans was me. But one man took pity on me: the man who became my Viceroy.  He taught me how to survive.  And in that dark place, where there was nothing of myself, I found my Reman brothers.  They showed me the only kindness I ever knew. \nA beat.  He glances to the Romulan crest on the wall. \nSHINZON For thousands of years the Romulan Senate has met in this chamber and dictated the fate of its sister- planet... But the time has come for us to live as equals. \nPICARD You're doing this to liberate the Remans? \nSHINZON No race should be a slave to another. \nPicard is impressed with Shinzon's quiet words. \n", "test2_true": "PICARD I have no reason to. \nSHINZON Of course you do.  If you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people... you'd be sitting where I am now.  At least I hope you would. \nPICARD And if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great responsibility in representing the Federation.  I can't let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions. \nSHINZON All I have is my personal feelings. I wasn't raised with the ideals of the Federation.  But I'm trying to understand them now.  To live up to them   To live up to you. \nA beat. \nSHINZON I want to know where I come from. The Remans gave me a future.  You can tell me about my past. \nPICARD There's so much, and so much of it is dull... \nSHINZON Were we always explorers? \nPlCARD No.  I was the first Picard to leave Earth.  It caused quite a stir, In fact.  But I had spent my whole life... \nSHINZON (finishing the sentence) Looking up at the stars. \nPICARD Yes. \nSHINZON And you dreamed about what was up there.  About... \nPICARD (finishing the sentence) New worlds. \nA beat. \nThey both reach for a carafe of water at the exact same instant.  Stop. \nPICARD After you, Praetor. \nSHINZON (smiles) Age before rank, Jean Luc. \nPicard smiles, pours a glass. \nPICARD So I'm not as tall as you expected? \nSHINZON I always hoped I would hit two meters. \nPICARD With a full head of hair. \nSHINZON (smiles) There is that. \nA quiet beat. \nPICARD Shinzon... I'm trying to believe you. \nSHINZON I know. \nPICARD If there's one ideal the Federation holds most dear it's that all men, all races, can be united.  From the first time the Vulcans came to Earth we've sought a future of peace.  Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friendship.  In time.  When trust has been earned. \nSHINZON I'm honored to think I might someday speak with such eloquence. \nA beat. \nSHINZON In time, Jean Luc. \nPICARD In time. \nINT.  SENATE CHAMBER - LATER \nPicard is gone.  Shinzon sits, thinking.  His Viceroy enters. \nVICEROY This is a mistake. \nSHINZON He's gentler than I thought.  And he has a sense of humor. \nVICEROY (stern) Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act.  Now.  Time is running out. \nSHINZON (snaps) My time.  I'll spend it how I choose. \nA tense beat. \nSHINZON We'll return to the Scimitar. Prepare yourself for the bonding. \nINT.  ENTERPRISE  BRIDGE - NIGHT \nPicard emerges from the turbolift.  Data, Worf and Geordi wait at the bridge engineering station. \nWORF Sir, we've had an unauthorized access into the main computer. \n", "test2_id": 2632, "test3_input": "At first we, don't quite see what they are doing.  Then we realize they are affixing black bars to the collars of their uniforms. \nMourning bands. \nPicard pours six glasses of his precious Chateau Picard. Each takes a glass. \nPicard raises his glass. \nPICARD To absent friends... o family. \nThey toast Data.  Slow fade to... \nINT.  ENTERPRISE - PICARD'S CABIN - NIGHT \nPicard sits at his desk, speaking quietly to someone we do not see. \nPICARD I don't know if all this has made sense to you, but I wanted you to know what kind of man he was.  In his quest to be more like us, he helped show us what it means to be human. \nWe see it is the now re-activated B-9 sitting across from him. \nB-9 My brother was not a human. \nPICARD No, he wasn't... But his wonder and his curiosity about every facet of human life helped all of us see the best parts of ourselves.  He embraced change... because he always wanted to be more than he was. \nB-9 I do not understand. \nPICARD Well, I hope someday you will. \nWorf interrupts on comm: \nWORF (V.O.) (ON COMM) Captain, the Hemingway has arrived to tow us to spacedock. \nPICARD On my way.  Please notify Commander Riker... (he stands, prepares to go) ... We'll talk later? \nThe B-9 does not respond.  He is looking rather blankly at the padd on Picard's desk. \nPicard begins to leave when a sound stops him... humming.  He turns back to the B-9. \nThe B-9 is still looking blankly at the padd... but he's humming lightly to himself... then he begins to sing, very softly... \nB-9 \"Blue skies, smiling at me, Nothing but blue skies do I see.\" \nThen the B-9 is silent. \nPicard watches him for a moment; great emotion playing over his features, and then goes. \nINT.  ENTERPRISE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nPicard and Riker head toward a turbolift... making their way past the debris littering the corridor. \nPICARD I'm sorry you won't be here for the re-fit, but I know the Titan needs you immediately. \nRiker does not respond. \nPicard stops, looks at Riker deeply. \nPICARD The Titan's a fine ship, Will.  And she's getting a captain worthy of her. \nRIKER She's the most beautiful ship I've ever seen. (he touches a wall of the corridor) ... But she's not the Enterprise. \nPICARD I promise you in time, she'll become your home... If I could offer you one piece of advice? \nRIKER Anything. \nPICARD When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him -- \nRIKER (smiles) I intend to. \nA moment. \nRIKER (with difficulty) Serving with you has been an honor. \nPICARD The honor was mine.  Captain Riker. \nEXT.  ENTERPRISE - SPACEDOCK - OVER EARTH \nA few weeks later.  The Enterprise is enclosed in the great womb of a spacedock.  The ship is being rebuilt. \nINT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - NIGHT \nA fresh-faced young officer, COMMANDER MARTIN MADDEN, paces nervously outside Picard's Ready Room.  Bracing himself before entering. \nBehind him we can see technicians working everywhere around the bridge, trying to rebuild it.  Worf is talking to a young officer at tactical and Geordi is working at the engineering station.  We also see new command chairs being installed. \n", "test3_true": "A young Andorian woman, the new OPS OFFICER, smiles at Madden's nervousness.  Her antennae twitch slightly in amusement.  He sees her. \nMADDEN So... what's the old man like? \nOPS OFFICER Why don't you go in and find out? \nCommander Madden prepares himself. \nINT.  ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM - FOLLOWING \nPicard is talking to Beverly on viewscreen.  She is in her new office at Starfleet Medical. \nBEVERLY (ON VIEWSCREEN) You can't imagine them, Jean Luc. They're kids!  All with advance degrees in xenobiology and out to conquer every disease in the quadrant. \nPICARD (smiles) Reminds me of a young doctor I used to know... \nBEVERLY (ON VIEWSCREEN) They're running me ragged.  Nothing but questions day and night... I love it!  Come to dinner and I'll tell you all about it.  There's a Bajoran band at the officer's mess. \nPICARD Not tonight, I have work here. \nBEVERLY (ON VIEWSCREEN) Soon then.  I'll save the last dance for you. \nCommander Madden enters quickly -- he did not use the door chime so Picard is surprised. \nMADDEN Commander Martin Madden reporting for duty, sir. \nPicard stands, they shake hands as: \nPICARD Welcome aboard, Commander.  I hope, your transfer didn't come as too much of a surprise. \nMADDEN I was... honored, sir. \nPICARD I needed you immediately to help oversee the re-fit... (gathering up some padds from his desk) ... Your service record on the Talos is exemplary, but there are a few things I would like to discuss with you regarding my requirements for a First Officer.  Shall we say dinner in my quarters at 1900 hours? \nMADDEN Very good, sir. \nPicard heads toward the door, carrying a few padds. \nPICARD Commander, I don't know how they did it on the Talos, but we have door chimes on the Enterprise.  We use them. \nMADDEN Yes, sir.  Sorry, sir. \nPicard goes to the bridge, Madden following... \nINT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING \nThey emerge to the bridge as Worf is arguing with the cocky young ENSIGN busy installing Picard's new high-tech command chair. \nWORF You don't understand the Captain -- there should be no changes until we have discussed the modifications with him. \nPicard goes to them: \nPICARD What's this? \nWORF (grumbles) Your new chair, sir. \nENSIGN It's the Mark Seven, Captain. State-of-the-art ergonomics... command interfaces with -- \nWORF I told him you're comfortable with your old chair. \nPICARD Let's give it a try. \nHe settles into his new command chair.  Looks around for a beat at his new bridge crew.  Fresh-faced kids.  A new generation to teach and nurture.  He smiles. \nPICARD Feels good. \nWorf and Geordi exchange a look, surprised. \nENSIGN (points) Try that button, sir. \nPicard presses a button on the chair and -- zip -- metal restraints fly into position around his waist and shoulders. Seatbelts!  Picard is surprised. \nA beat. \nThen Picard smiles. \nPICARD It's about time. \nHe presses the button again and the restraints zip back into the body of the chair.  He is delighted.  He turns to Madden: \nPICARD Commander, please sit down... \n", "test3_id": 2633}

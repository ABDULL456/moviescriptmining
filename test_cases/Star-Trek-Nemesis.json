{"test1_input": "Heavy drapes are drawn against any hint of the sun.  Shinzon is in conference with the Romulan Commanders and Senator Tal'Aura.  Commander Donatra watches him closely. \nCommander Suran is angry, pacing.  Shinzon stands.  His Viceroy lurks in a corner. \nSURAN ... then I don't understand the reason for the delay! \nSHINZON You don't have to understand. \nSURAN And bringing the Enterprise here?! What possible purpose could that serve?! \nSHINZON I have a purpose. \nSURAN Then perhaps you will enlighten us? \nSHINZON (snaps) Silence, Romulan! \nA tense beat.  Shinzon regains his composure. \nSHINZON You must learn patience, Commander. Do you know where I learned it?  In the dilithium mines of Remus. Spend eighteen hours every day under the lash of a Romulan guard's whip and you'll soon understand patience. \nSURAN (carefully bows his head) Praetor. \nSHINZON Now go.  I have some personal business. \nSuran and the others go. \nDonatra turns just as she is leaving the chamber, she sees the Viceroy going to Shinzon.  And then do something odd. The Viceroy puts his hand on Shinzon's chest, leans very close and talks to him quietly.  This is an ancient form of Reman telepathic medical diagnosis. \nThis strange sight perplexes Donatra.  The doors close, blocking her view... \nINT.  SENATE - CORRIDOR - FOLLOWING \nWe go with Donatra and the other Romulans.  Donatra speaks quietly to Suran: \nDONATRA How long before he has us in the dilithium mines? \nINT.  ENTERPRISE - DATA'S CABIN - DAY \nThe B-9 sits placidly in a chair, staring forward. \nThen, as if a switch was thrown, he moves.  He quickly rises and goes to a computer console.  He efficiently starts punching in commands at an amazing velocity. \nINT.  ROMULAN SENATE CHAMBER - NIGHT \nPicard and Shinzon sit alone in a corner of the sweeping Senate chamber.  The remains of dinner before them. \nSHINZON And when I was ready they were going to replace you with me, an exact biological duplicate.  Put a Romulan agent at the heart of Starfleet to influence your command structure.  It was a bold plan. \nPICARD What happened? \nSHINZON As happens so frequently here on Romulus, a new government came to power.  They decided to abandon the plan -- frankly, I think they were afraid I'd be discovered and it would lead to war.  They weren't ready for that. \nPicard pours a glass of Romulan ale. \nSHINZON Romulan ale -- I'm surprised.  I can't stand it. \nPICARD (smiles) You'll acquire a taste for it. \nA beat.  They look at each other. \nSHINZON It's not quite the face you remember. \nPICARD Not quite.  I envy the hairline. \nSHINZON A lifetime of violence will do that.  My nose was broken four times.  And my jaw... But so much is the same.  The eyes, you recognize the eyes. \nPICARD Yes.  The eyes have it. \nSHINZON Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they?  Yours are so confident. \nPICARD How did you end up on Remus? \nSHINZON They sent me there to die.  How could a mere human survive the dilithium mines?  It was... (he can't find the words) ... I was a slave.  And a monster. The only thing the Romulan guards hated more than the Remans was me. But one man took pity on me: the man who became my Viceroy.  He taught me how to survive.  And in that dark place, where there was nothing of myself, I found my Reman brothers.  They showed me the only kindness I ever knew. \nA beat.  He glances to the Romulan crest on the wall. \nSHINZON For thousands of years the Romulan Senate has met in this chamber and dictated the fate of its sister- planet... But the time has come for us to live as equals. \nPICARD You're doing this to liberate the Remans? \nSHINZON No race should be a slave to another. \nPicard is impressed with Shinzon's quiet words. \n", "test1_true": "PICARD I have no reason to. \nSHINZON Of course you do.  If you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people... you'd be sitting where I am now.  At least I hope you would. \nPICARD And if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great responsibility in representing the Federation.  I can't let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions. \nSHINZON All I have is my personal feelings. I wasn't raised with the ideals of the Federation.  But I'm trying to understand them now.  To live up to them   To live up to you. \nA beat. \nSHINZON I want to know where I come from. The Remans gave me a future.  You can tell me about my past. \nPICARD There's so much, and so much of it is dull... \nSHINZON Were we always explorers? \nPlCARD No.  I was the first Picard to leave Earth.  It caused quite a stir, In fact.  But I had spent my whole life... \nSHINZON (finishing the sentence) Looking up at the stars. \nPICARD Yes. \nSHINZON And you dreamed about what was up there.  About... \nPICARD (finishing the sentence) New worlds. \nA beat. \nThey both reach for a carafe of water at the exact same instant.  Stop. \nPICARD After you, Praetor. \nSHINZON (smiles) Age before rank, Jean Luc. \nPicard smiles, pours a glass. \nPICARD So I'm not as tall as you expected? \nSHINZON I always hoped I would hit two meters. \nPICARD With a full head of hair. \nSHINZON (smiles) There is that. \nA quiet beat. \nPICARD Shinzon... I'm trying to believe you. \nSHINZON I know. \nPICARD If there's one ideal the Federation holds most dear it's that all men, all races, can be united.  From the first time the Vulcans came to Earth we've sought a future of peace.  Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friendship.  In time.  When trust has been earned. \nSHINZON I'm honored to think I might someday speak with such eloquence. \nA beat. \nSHINZON In time, Jean Luc. \nPICARD In time. \nINT.  SENATE CHAMBER - LATER \nPicard is gone.  Shinzon sits, thinking.  His Viceroy enters. \nVICEROY This is a mistake. \nSHINZON He's gentler than I thought.  And he has a sense of humor. \nVICEROY (stern) Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act.  Now.  Time is running out. \nSHINZON (snaps) My time.  I'll spend it how I choose. \nA tense beat. \nSHINZON We'll return to the Scimitar. Prepare yourself for the bonding. \nINT.  ENTERPRISE  BRIDGE - NIGHT \nPicard emerges from the turbolift.  Data, Worf and Geordi wait at the bridge engineering station. \nWORF Sir, we've had an unauthorized access into the main computer. \n", "test1_id": 2631, "test2_input": "PICARD Who was it? \nGEORDI It's going to take some time to find out -- the data stream was rerouted through substations all over the ship. \nPICARD What programs were accessed? \nGEORDI That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations.  It's not even restricted material. \nPICARD (to Worf) Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again, we want to be ready. \nGEORDI (grim) There's something else.  I was reviewing the sensor logs... (he refers to some readouts on his console) When the Scimitar decloaked there was a momentary spike in the tertiary EM band -- there -- You're not going to believe this but it's Thalaron. \nPicard is shocked. \nINT.  SICKBAY - NIGHT \nPicard stands, concerned, with Beverly, Geordi and Data. Monitors showing Thalaron research are visible. \nPICARD ... I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical. \nGEORDI Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up.  But he's got it, Captain. \nPICARD As I remember, Thalaron research was banned in the Federation because of its bioqenic properties. \nBEVERLY It has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level.  I can't overestimate the danger of Thalaron radiation, Jean Luc.  A microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds. \nPICARD Understood.  Keep on it.  I need to know what he has and how to neutralize any threat.  Give me options. \nPicard goes.  Data thinks for a moment. \nDATA Doctor, will you excuse us for a moment?  Geordi, please come with me. \nHe and Geordi head out.  Beverly returns to some medical displays showing Thalaron research, her expression deeply concerned. \nINT.  ENTERPRISE - PICARD'S CABIN - NIGHT \nPicard is sitting at his desk, flipping through an old photo album.  He stops and stares at one of the pictures deeply troubled.  We finally see the photo: Young Jean Luc Picard. A serious, unsmiling cadet at Starfleet Academy.  The face before him bears a disturbing resemblance to Shinzon. \nThe door comm chirps. \nPICARD Come... (Beverly enters) ... Beverly, come in. \nBEVERLY You're working late. \nShe sits, notes the picture of Young Jean Luc. \nPICARD Remember him? \nBEVERLY He was a bit proud as I recall. \nPICARD He was a damn fool.  Selfish and ambitious.  Very much in need of seasoning. \nBEVERLY He turned out all right. \nHe rises, goes to a window, gazes at the Scimitar in the distance.  A beat. \nPICARD I so wanted to believe Shinzon. But the Thalaron radiation can't be explained away.  Whatever he's after, it's not peace. \nBEVERLY Is he very much like you were? \nPICARD Yes. \nData interrupts on comm: \nDATA (V.O.) (ON COMM) Data to Captain Picard.  Geordi and I have identified the source of the unauthorized computer access.  And, I believe, we have also discovered an opportunity to gain a tactical advantage. \nPICARD (to comm) On my way... \nBEVERLY (stands) Jean Luc -- whatever you were -- right now you're the man you've made yourself.  He's someone else. \nPICARD I wish I could believe that, Doctor. \nHe goes. \nINT.  ENTERPRISE - TURBOLIFT - MORNING \nDeanna is alone on the turbolift.  Then a voice makes her spin: \nSHINZON (V.O.) Imzadi... \nShinzon stands across from her. \nDEANNA You're not here. \n", "test2_true": "He pushes her against the wall, with passion and almost violence. \nDEANNA No... \nSHINZON I can feel your desire, Deanna... \nShe forces herself to concentrate... to resist telepathically... it is a mighty effort... this Romulan is hot.  And the world around her appears to be changing... bending... \nAnd she is momentarily in a cabin on the Scimitar.  Although entirely a telepathic experience, it is as if she has actually traveled. \nShe sees Shinzon kneeling over a small flame, she realizes she is looking through the Viceroy's eyes. \nOn the Scimitar, Shinzon looks up at the Viceroy/Deanna: \nSHINZON I can feel your hunger to know the Reman ways... the old ways. \nThen the world changes again... \nDeanna is on the turbolift.  Shinzon is pressed against her, whispering: \nSHINZON Don't fear what you desire... \nShe forces him away from her and -- \nShe is alone.  She sinks to her knees.  Overcome with emotion. \nINT.  SCIMITAR - VICEROY'S CABIN - FOLLOWING \nThe Viceroy, in a kind of trace, kneels before a small flame. Shinzon kneels across from him.  The Viceroy raises his head. \nVICEROY The bond is broken. \nSHINZON Find her again. \nVICEROY No -- this is wasting time. \nSHINZON Do as I tell you! \nA Reman officer interrupts on comm: \nREMAN OFFICER (V.O.) Praetor, we've received the transponder signal. \nSHINZON (to comm) On my way. \nHe begins to go -- but suddenly stops, a wave of illness overtaking him. \nThe Viceroy puts his hand on Shinzon's chest.  A strange moment as the Viceroy shuts his eyes and feels Shinzon's chest.  His mind... probing. \nThen the Viceroy looks up at him, grim. \nVICEROY It's accelerating.  You have no more time for games. \nSHINZON Have the doctors prepare.  I'll be on the bridge. \nHe goes. \nINT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - DAY \nShinzon stands with some REMAN ENGINEERS. \nSHINZON Transport. \nAn Engineer activates a transporter and the B-9 materializes! \nSHINZON Welcome home. (to Engineers) Begin the download. \nReman engineers go to the B-9 and open the panel in his neck, begin connecting computer conduits to the extra memory port we saw earlier. \n(Note: Although the audience will not know it yet, this is actually Data pretending to be the B-9.) \nShinzon goes to a replicator unit and orders: \nSHINZON Tea, hot. \nA cup of tea appears.  He takes it and sips as he watches his Engineers connecting the conduits to the B-9. \nINT.  ENTERPRISE - SICKBAY - DAY \nBeverly is scanning Deanna.  Picard and Riker watch, concerned. \nBEVERLY Aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels, you're completely normal. \n", "test2_id": 2632, "test3_input": "Shinzon, supremely confident, leans back in his command chair. \nSHINZON Open a channel. \nINT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING \nPicard is still entering commands in his chair console. \nDATA We are being hailed. \nPICARD Deanna, stand by. (to Data) Open a channel. \nSHINZON (V.O.) I hope you're still alive, Jean Luc. \nPICARD I am. \nSHINZON (V.O.) Don't you think it's time to surrender?  I'll have my cloak back in a matter of minutes and your poor ship is shot to pieces.  Why should the rest of your crew have to die? \nPicard continues to enter command codes -- transmits them to Deanna at helm -- she receives the commands, nods.  All of this as Picard buys some time: \nPICARD I never told you about my first Academy evaluation, did I?  I received very high marks for my studies.  But I was found lacking in certain other areas. Personality traits, you might say. In particular I was thought to be extremely... (he glares up at the prow of the Scimitar) ... over-confident. \nPicard indicates for Data to end the communication.  Then: \nPICARD (quickly) Geordi, put 211 power to the engines.  Take it from life support if you have to -- everything you can give me. \nGEORDI Aye, sir. \nPICARD Deanna, on my mark. \nGEORDI Ready, sir! \nPicard leans forward in his chair: \nPICARD (on comm) All hands, brace for impact! (to Deanna) ENGAGE. \nEXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE \nThe Enterprise powers forward in a final thrust -- ! \nINT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING \nShinzon sees it coming -- utterly shocked -- bolts up -- \nSHINZON HARD TO PORT ! \nToo late. \nEXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE \nA massive COLLISION as the Enterprise SLAMS into the Scimitar -- as it SMASHES and GRINDS into Shinzon's ship -- \nThe Scimitar REELS -- \nINT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING \nEveryone goes FLYING! \nEXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE \nThe two great ships are now locked together, slowly rotating in space. \nThe forward part of the Enterprise's saucer is enmeshed in Shinzon's ship; two scorpions with their claws locked. \nINT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING \nShinzon stands in the ruins of his bridge.  Many of his bridge crew are now dead. \nSHINZON Divert all power to engines.  Full reverse! \nEXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE \nEvery part of the Enterprise ROCKS -- a great lurch as the Scimitar begins to tear itself free -- backing away -- a deafening shriek of metal -- both ships are being torn to pieces in the process -- but it is working -- the Scimitar is ripping free, wrenching itself loose. \nINT.  ENTERPRISE - JEFFERIES TUBES - FOLLOWING \nThe Jefferies tube SHUDDERS as the Scimitar continues to tear itself free -- Riker and the Viceroy careen through the tube. The Viceroy recovers quickly and coils for a final attack. Riker sees that an access plate has been loosened in the collision -- he desperately rips it away -- knowing the relays behind will provide him with the advantage he needs -- \nBright light strobes from the relays and the Viceroy is momentarily blinded -- Riker uses this opportunity to attack! He dives forward -- slamming into the Viceroy -- they both tumble into a long, vertical access tunnel -- they fall! \nRiker shoots out a hand and grabs a ladder -- the Viceroy, grabs onto Riker, his talons digging into his uniform -- a long drop below them! \nRiker forces the Viceroy's head back -- away from him -- a brutal struggle -- \n", "test3_true": "RIKER Don't worry -- Hell is dark. \nRiker uses every ounce of strength he has left -- pushes the Viceroy off him -- \nThe Viceroy falls down the long tunnel -- to his death. \nINT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING \nThe whole Enterprise bridge QUAKES as the Scimitar continues to pull itself free -- \nPicard stands, steadying himself on his command chair. \nPICARD Data, I need you. \nData joins Picard as: \nPICARD Computer.  Auto-destruct sequence Omega.  Zero time delay.  Recognize voice pattern Jean Luc Picard. Authorization Alpha Alpha Three Zero Five -- \nCOMPUTER (V.O.) Auto-destruct is off-line. \nThen the ship gives a final LURCH.  The Scimitar is free. \nAn eerie moment of silence after the explosive tearing and grinding. \nPicard watches through the gaping hole in the hull as the Scimitar backs away.  Another section of the Scimitar disappears.  Shinzon almost has his cloak back. \nINT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING \nShinzon stares at the Enterprise. \nA wave of sickness overcomes him for a moment, he doubles over.  We actually see more veins appearing on his face. Time is running out. \nSHINZON Target disruptors.  Destroy them. \nREMAN OFFICER Disruptors are off-line, sir. \nA beat.  Shinzon looks up. \nSHINZON Deploy the weapon.  Kill everything on that ship.  Then set a course for Earth. \nREMAN OFFICER What about Picard? \nSHINZON Our greater goal is more important, brother. \nREMAN OFFICER But, Praetor, you won't survive without him... \nShinzon gazes at the Enterprise on the viewscreen. \nSHINZON Some ideals are worth dying for, aren't they, Jean Luc? \nEXT.  RIFT - SPACE \nThe entire Scimitar slowly begins to unfold.  Like a gigantic version of the small spider-weapon we saw kill the Romulan Senators before, legs appear and hoist up a savage weapon. The Cascading Pulse. \nINT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING \nPicard and the others watch the monstrous Cascading Pulse weapon slowly deploying. \nPICARD How long until he can fire? \nGEORDI The targeting sequence should take about four minutes. \nDEANNA But how can he?  He'll kill you. \nPICARD This isn't about me anymore. \nPicard's face is set, resolute.  He knows what he must do. Picard grabs a phaser rifle from a weapons locker as... \nPICARD Prepare for a site-to-site transport. \nGEORDI (concerned) Sir, we won't be able to bring you back.  It's a one way trip. Captain, I don't know if the transporter -- \nPICARD That's an order, Commander. \nDATA Sir, allow me to go.  You are needed here. \nPICARD Negative. \nDATA Sir... \nDeanna takes Data's arm.  Looks at him.  She knows this is something Picard must do himself. \n", "test3_id": 2633}

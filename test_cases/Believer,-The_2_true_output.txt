DANNY The mother. 
Kyle nods, patient, is drawing Danny's attention back to the target when... 
DRAKE 
Sets up beside them, begins squeezing off rounds so fast, it sounds like an automatic weapon. 
TARGETS: the bullets chew up and knock over all four Jews. And selectively: shooting the man's face, the woman's breasts, the boy and girl in the groin. The dog he merely flattens. 
Drake looks at Danny without expression, drops the clip, shoves in a fresh one and riddles the black family in similar fashion. 
EXT. MOTEL PORCH -- NIGHT 
Danny, pay phone to his ear, flipping through a New York Times. He throws it aside as a voice comes on the line.... 
DANNY Carla?... It's me, Danny...Danny Balint...? We met at that...[meeting at your house.] 
CARLA'S VOICE Yeah, I remember.... Kill any Jews yet? 
DANNY I didn't realize you cared. 
CARLA'S VOICE I don't. I was just curious how full of shit you were. 
DANNY Did you know that there was a New York Times reporter there that night? 
CARLA'S VOICE Really, which one? I bet it was the guy with the Prada shoes. 
DANNY I didn't notice his shoes.... Did your mother know he was there? 
CARLA'S VOICE I doubt it. How did you find out? 
DANNY He called me up. He wanted to talk to me about my ideas. 
CARLA I bet. He didn't realize that nobody who talks such a good game ever plays one. 
DANNY You weren't complaining about my play last time. 
CARLA'S VOICE That's a much easier game. 
DANNY Why don't you come visit, we'll have a rematch. 
CARLA Too many good players down here. I'm with one right now. 
DANNY Oh, really? 
CARLA Bigger and better. 
DANNY Then how come you're talking to me? 
CARLA'S VOICE I'm not. 
Click. She's gone. He hangs up, walks straight into... 
INT. MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT 
Nazis sprawled about, drinking beer, impassively watching TV. The bulldog pants on the floor. Carleton calls to it: 
CARLETON Gas Chamber... 
It trots over, receives a scrap of food. Everything desultory: 
DANNY (to the whole room) When are we going to do something? 
People glance up wearily: give us a break.... 
EXT. TOWN -- DAY 
Danny, Billings, O.L., and Drake walk through the town, looking for trouble. A couple of local TEENAGERS watch them, impressed by the swastikas, tattoos, swagger. 
INT. DELICATESSEN -- DAY 
Two WAITERS (Jewish college students, athletic, confident) watch the Nazis come in. One indicates to the other that he'll handle this. He brings menus, water; he's carefully polite. 
FIRST WAITER You know what you want? 
BILLINGS We sure do.

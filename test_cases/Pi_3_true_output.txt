MAX You gotta car? LENNY MEYER Yeah, right there. That's Ephraim, my friend. 
We swing around with Max and see a station wagon. 
EPHRAIM sits in the passenger Seat. He's a big-boned, bearded, Orthodox Jew. 
MAX All tight, lets go. LENNY MEYER Great... They head for the station wagon. 
INT. BASEMENT SHUL - NIGHT 
The synagogue is a claustrophobic, fluorescent-lit room in general disarray. Two rows of imitation-wooden pews face a makeshift altar and Ark. Young Hasidic Men study texts. Some work alone, reading and dovening. Others are in small groups sharing in heated discussions. 
Lenny wraps the Tefillin around Max's arm. Max just wants to get out of there. Ephraim prays in the background. 
MAX Lenny, I don't really want to do... 
LENNY MEYER Do it for me? It means a lot, having someone of your stature performing a mitzvah in my presence. (Beat) When you told me your name was Max Cohen, I didn't realize you were the Max Cohen. Maximilian Cohen. MAX You know me? LENNY MEYER 0f course, I've followed your research since your Columbia days. It's revolutionary. You've inspired the work we do. MAX I have? LENNY MEYER Yes, very much so. The only difference is, we're not looking at stocks. We're searching for a pattern in Torah. Lenny finishes wrapping Max's arm. He reaches for another box and strap. 
MAX What kind of pattern? LENNY MEYER We're not really sure. Our calculations have shown us that there is a number encoded in the text. 
MAX What sort of number? LENNY MEYER We don't know. All we know is that it's two hundred and sixteen digits long. Max, stunned looks at Lenny. 
LENNY MEYER Don't worry. This one just goes over your head. Lenny places the other Teffilin over Max's head. Max collects himself. 
MAX (Coolly) Two sixteen? LENNY MEYER Yes. Now we have to say a small prayer, repeat after me. Bewildered, Max does. After the prayer... 
LENNY MEYER That's it. Wasn't so bad, was it? You feel anything? Lenny starts removing the Teffillin from Max. 
MAX What is it? LENNY MEYER It's a prayer about our dedication to our one and only God. MAX (Attempting calmness) No, I mean the number, the two sixteen number? What is it? LENNY MEYER Oh. We don't know. We just know that it's the most common number encoded in the text. It might be some type of linguistic pattern. If we could figure out what the number is we could maybe answer that. 
MAX Tell me more. EXT. SOL'S APARTMENT - DAWN

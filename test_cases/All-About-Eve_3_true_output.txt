ADDISON Almost four. 
EVE Plenty of time for a nice long nap - we rehearsed most of last night... 
ADDISON You could sleep, too, couldn't you? 
EVE Why not? 
They've arrived at her door. She opens it. 
ADDISON The mark of a true killer. (he holds out his hand) Sleep tight, rest easy - and come out fighting... 
EVE Why'd call me a killer? 
ADDISON Did I say killer? I meant champion. I get my boxing terms mixed. 
He turns to go. After a few steps- 
EVE (calling) Addison- (he pauses) - come on in for just a minute, won't you? There's... I've got something to tell you. 
Addison turns curiously, and enters behind her. 
INT. EVE'S SUITE - TAFT HOTEL - DAY 
Old-fashioned, dreary and small. The action starts in the living room and continues to the bedroom. 
Addison closes the door, crosses to a comfortable chair. 
ADDISON Suites are for expense accounts. Aren't you being extravagant? 
EVE Max is paying for it. He and Lloyd had a terrific row but Lloyd insisted... well. Can I fix you a drink? 
She indicates a table elaborately stocked with liquor, glasses, etc. Addison's eyebrows lift. 
ADDISON Also with the reluctant compliments of Max Fabian. 
EVE Lloyd. I never have any, and he likes a couple of drinks after we finish - so he sent it up... 
ADDISON Some plain soda. (Eve starts to fix it) Lloyd must be expecting a record run in New Haven... 
EVE That's for tonight. You're invited. We're having everyone up after the performance. 
ADDISON We're? 
EVE Lloyd and I. 
She carries the soda to him, sits on an ottoman at his feet. 
ADDISON I find it odd that Karen isn't here for the opening, don't you? 
He sips his soda and puts away, carefully avoiding a look at Eve. As he looks back- 
EVE Addison... 
ADDISON (blandly) She's always been so fantastically devoted to Lloyd. I would imagine that only death or destruction could keep her- 
EVE (breaks in) Addison, just a few minutes ago. When I told you this would be a night to remember - that it would bring me everything I wanted- 
ADDISON (nods) - something about an old road ending and a new one starting - paved with stars... 
EVE I didn't mean just the Theater. 
ADDISON What else? 
Eve gets up, crosses to look out over the Common. 
EVE (her back to him) Lloyd Richards. He's going to leave Karen. We're going to be married. 
For just a flash, Addison's eyes narrow coldly, viciously. Then they crinkle into a bland smile. 
ADDISON So that's it. Lloyd. Still just the Theater, after all... 
EVE (turns; shocked) It's nothing of the kind! Lloyd loves me, I love him! 
ADDISON I know nothing about Lloyd and his loves - I leave those to Louisa May Alcott. But I do know you. 
EVE I'm in love with Lloyd! 
ADDISON Lloyd Richards is commercially the most successful playwright in America- 
EVE You have no right to say such things! 
ADDISON - and artistically, the most promising! Eve dear, this is Addison. 
Eve drops her shocked manner like a cape. Her face lights up - she crosses back to the ottoman. 
EVE Addison, won't it be just perfect? Lloyd and I - there's no telling how far we can go... he'll write great plays for me, I'll make them be great! (as she sits) You're the only one I've told, the only one that knows except Lloyd and me... 
ADDISON ... and Karen. 
EVE She doesn't know. 
KAREN She knows enough not to be here. 
EVE But not all of it - not that Lloyd and I are going to be married.

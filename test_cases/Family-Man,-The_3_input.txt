He turns and sees Annie at the open garage door, sitting on her bike, ringing the BELL. 
Its an eerie moment for Jack... 
JACK What are you doing? 
ANNIE (a curious look) Ringing my bell... 
On Jacks anxious face...

CHAPTER FIFTEEN  SAYING GOODBYE 
110	INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT 
On Jack...crouched down in an aisle of this local convenience store...checking out the bags of rock salt... 
He looks at the price tag on one of the bags... 
JACK Four ninety nine?! Its just salt for gods sake... 
On the entrance to the store...the door opens, a YOUNG GIRL, 17, enters, an average suburban teenager... 
She glances at a fashion magazine, picks up a package of gum... 
From the POV of the cashier, we see the girl approach the counter... 
On Jack, crouched down in the aisle. He grabs a bag of salt from the shelf, when... 
CASH (O.S.) Thatll be sixty five cents, little angel... 
Jack registers the voice...he rises slowly, looking over to the front counter...where he sees... 
Cash, dressed in a typical chain convenience store uniform, ringing up the teenager... 
An excited smile from Jack at the sight of Cash... 
JACK You...! 
Then...the color drains from Jacks face... 
JACK (CONTD) What are you doing here... 
Jack moves toward Cash at the counter... 
JACK (CONTD) Youre not sending me back... 
The girl eyes Jack curiously, then removes a dollar bill from her pocket and slides it across the counter to Cash... 
CASH Jack, its good to see you... 
Cash reaches into the register, taking out change for ten dollars...he hands the girl $9.35... 
CASH (CONTD) (to the girl) Thank you darlin... 
The girl looks at the money, realizing that Cash has given her the wrong change... 
CASH (CONTD) (back to Jack, seeing the rock salt) What do you got there, rock salt?  Look at you, all domestic and shit... You really figured some things out, huh? 
The girl looks at Cash talking to Jack... 
JACK Im not going back... 
The girl hesitates...Cash turns to her... 
CASH (to the girl) Everything okay...? 
She looks at him, a moment of decision, then... 
TEENAGE GIRL Yeah...fine. 
JACK (raising his voice) Hey! Did you hear me...?! 
Cash ignores Jack, watching the girl as she heads to the door, hesitates a moment, then walks out... 
A look of disappointment on Cashs face as he reaches into his pocket, pulling out a little notebook... 
Cash looks at Jack. 
CASH (making a note in his book) 
That was a character issue... (shaking his head) ...and for nine dollars? Thats just sad... 
JACK Hey, Im talking to you! I am not going back, do you understand...?! 
Cash looks at him, compassion on his face. 
JACK (CONTD) You cant do this. You cant keep coming in and out of peoples lives, messing things up... 
CASH Cmon, Jack... 
Jack throws six bucks on the counter... 
JACK Ive got kids, Im going home... 
CASH You know what the word glimpse means, J? Its by nature an impermanent thing. 
Jack walks determinedly toward the exit. He stops and turns at the door... 
JACK (pointing at Cash) Im staying. 
Cash follows him with his eyes, a proud look on Cashs face as Jack leaves... 
111	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, JOSHS ROOM - LATE NIGHT 
Jack walks to Josh.  Hes sleeping soundly. 
Jack gently kisses Josh on the head, careful not to wake him.

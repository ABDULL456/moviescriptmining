(from notes he's made) Owens died of cancer in '97. Villalobos, a car crash. Atkins committed suicide. Jamison was at the Pentagon, 9-11, body never recovered. Wilson I'm still trying to track down. Garret and Howard trade looks. 
MARCO 
Sir, I know I can't ask you to talk to Congressman Shaw, not yet, but Al Melvin, it's a phone call, a quick q&a -- look at his notebooks, hear what he's been dreaming -- and either he will support the credibility of what I'm saying, or he won't. And I'll shut up. 
COLONEL GARRET 
And what is it you are saying, exactly, Major? That you misrepresented -- falsified -- what happened In Kuwait? About the Medal of Honor? In effect, committed perjury. 
MARCO 
If you just talk to Melvin -- 
COLONEL GARRET 
(ignores) -- No, no, I'm sorry -- you're saying an entire squad of U.S. Army soldiers was hypnotized into believing that Raymond Shaw deserved the Medal of Honor. And somehow you're the only one who knows the truth. Silence.   Marco looks down at his hands. 
COLONEL GARRET 
Major Marco. You will stay clear of Congressman Shaw. 
MARCO 
Yes sir. 
LT. COL. HOWARD 
And you will resume your meds, Major. That is an order. 
MARCO 
Yes sir. Beat.   Marco stands up, to leave, but -- 
COLONEL GARRET 
Major, do you ever take a step back and consider why you've remained at rank for all these years? Missed Bosnia, Afghanistan, Iraqi Freedom. While men of lesser promise and inferior talent have enjoyed the fruits of those campaigns and moved beyond you? 
MARCO 
Every day, sir.

... there are still VRF terrorists in Sierra Leone, new terrorist alliances forming in many parts of Asia and South America -- we can't simply, suddenly relinquish our commitment to world leaders who have stood by us.

Congressman Shaw -- your rebuttal?

Marco on his phone, the t.v. blaring, under:

-- but meanwhile, somebody's grandmother, in a small American town, is standing in her kitchen -- she's got her medicine bottle in one hand, she's opening the refrigerator with the other. And she's thinking: I can pay for my medicine, or I can pay for my dinner. I can't do both. In America. In America, our mothers and grandmothers shouldn't have to worry about that. VOICE on the other end of Marco's call, but he's slow to respond -- mesmerized by the "new" Raymond -- 
MARCO 
(on the phone) Yeah, yeah. I'm here ... As he starts to write an address --

RAYMOND (V.O.) 
There are gaps in this country. Ugly chasms that we need to bridge ... THE SIDE OF A BUS with a HUGE SKIN of Gov. Arthur and Raymond Shaw and the ARTHUR/SHAW "SECURE TOMORROW" campaign icon -- it SLIDES away, revealing: MARCO -- crosses the street, walks along a row of dilapidated apartments --

At the far end of a long and gloomy hallway, we can see Marco arrive at the door to Melvin's room. He hesitates, then knocks -- 
MARCO 
Al?   Al Melvin, it's Marco ... Nothing. He looks at his watch, turns, walks back down the narrow, high-ceilinged corridor -- haunting sounds of radios and televisions and broken conversations -- he disappears down the stairs -- 
73   INT. FANCY HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT                              73 
Raymond comes down the brightly-lit, elegant hallway, tired, trailing Anderson and his SECRET SERVICE entourage.

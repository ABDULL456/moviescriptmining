COURTHOUSE PROCESSING AREA - DAY \nMARGARET O'REILLY, 34, is speaking to herself. \nMARGARET La la la la la. Like you've never done worse. \nFrom a NEW ANGLE, we see she's using a cell phone earpiece. \nMARGARET (CONT'D) Okay, yes. He totalled a car. But it was an environmentally friendly car. Why doesn't that get reported? \nA beat. \nMARGARET (CONT'D) Please! He was heartbroken, betrayed. You say you understand but you don't. You can't. You're like a big giant Vulcan. \nNoticing something to her right... \nMARGARET (CONT'D) He's coming. I'll call you later. \nShe hangs up, wrapping the earpiece around her phone.   We reveal \nGARY \nbeing escorted through glass doors by a polo-shirted PAROLE OFFICER. Margaret moves to intercept them, offering a hand. \nMARGARET (CONT'D) Hi.    Margaret. I work for Lola. \nGARY Gary. \nMARGARET I know. (to the Parole Officer) We need to go out the back. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BACK HALLWAY - DAY \nMargaret leads the way.      She's been here before. \nGARY Are there reporters out front? \nMARGARET A few. Not Hugh Grant level. More like Robert Downey, Jr. when he broke into that family's house and slept in the kid's bed like Goldilocks. \"This bed is just right.\" I handled episodes two through four for Robert. This sort of thing is my specialty. \nGARY What is? \nMARGARET Famous fuck-ups. Don't worry. Mama's gonna take good care of you. \nA phone RINGS. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

Yes. \nHe looks to Margaret while the other end of the call talks at length. Then, very deliberately... \nGARY (CONT'D) The weather in Toledo is rainy. \nHe says this like a sleeper agent repeating his trigger phrase. \nPAROLE OFFICER Use your normal voice. \nGARY (to the phone) Nine dogs ran through the field. The koala sits in the tree. \nThe Parole Officer takes the phone from him, punching in a series of numbers and jotting notes on his work sheet. \nMARGARET It's computer voice recognition. The system can call you any time day or night. If you don't answer within five rings, the police come and haul your ass off. \nGARY What if I'm not here? \nCatching the officer's concerned look... \nMARGARET That's why it's called house arrest. You stay inside your house. (to the officer) He can take direction, I promise. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAY \nMargaret pulls open curtains, flooding the room with light. Gary wanders, checking it all out. \nMARGARET Okay, just so it's said, this house is flammable. \nGARY I didn't mean to burn down my house. \nMARGARET Yeah, I didn't mean to eat my way into a ten-year shame spiral, but I did, and it's healthier to acknowledge it. (moving on) This flammable house belongs to one of Lola's other fabulous clients, who is currently shooting a pilot in Toronto. \nGARY Actor? \nMARGARET Writer. So for the next six weeks, su casa es su casa. I say, feel free to wear his clothes. He'll probably get a sick thrill of out it. The gays. \nNoticing two crates... \nGARY He has dogs? \nMARGARET They're away at summer camp.    Now, try the bed. \nHe lies back on it, feeling it out. \nGARY It's fine. \nMARGARET Comfortable? \nGARY Sure. \nShe massages his besocked feet. \nMARGARET Look, Gary, I know this has been crazy and stressful. I want you to feel safe. And comfortable. \nGARY I do. \nMARGARET I'm a fan of yours, you know.   Your number-one fan. \nGary looks over his toes at Margaret. From this angle, she looks a bit like Kathy Bates from Misery. \nMARGARET (CONT'D) But if you fuck this up, I will smash your ankles with a sledge hammer. \nA long beat. \nMARGARET (CONT'D) That wouldn't be comfortable for either of us. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

And when it was all over, I said to myself, \"Is that all there is to a fire?\" Is that all there is? \nAs she starts to SING, Gary realizes the story isn't hers at all. It's Peggy Lee's \"Is That All There Is.\" \nSARAH (CONT'D) Is that all there is, is that all there is? If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing. \nShe leans closer. \nSARAH (CONT'D) Let's break out the booze and have a ball.

We would take long walks by the river or just sit for hours gazing into each other's eyes. We were so very much in love. Then one day he went away and I thought I'd die. But I didn't.

If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep... \nINT. ANTIQUE HARDWARE STORE - DAY \nDeep in the bowels of the store, Sarah is surrounded by vintage lighting fixtures. She's (futilely) trying to match a specific light switch plate. \nTO CAMERA: \nSARAH I know what you're thinking. If that's the way she feels about it why doesn't she just end it all? I'm in no hurry for that final disappointment. I know just as well as I'm standing here talking to you, when that final moment comes and I'm breathing my last breath, I'll be saying to myself... \nINT.   LIVING ROOM - DAY \nSarah and Gary become more intimately acquainted on the couch. They still haven't kissed, but hands are running up and down over clothing. Sarah isn't singing anymore, though her voice continues. \nSARAH'S VOICE Is that all there is, is that all there is? If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing.

Sarah pushes back. Gary tries to close the gap, but she's already standing up. \nSARAH I need to... \nGARY Just... \nSARAH My shoes.     Are here.     Okay. \nAs she reaches for one, she knocks over a wine glass. \nSARAH (CONT'D) Crap! \nGARY Don't worry about it.         Just... \nSARAH I'm going.     Bye. \nCarrying both her shoes, she's across the room and out the front door before he can say anything more. \nCUT TO: \nINT. KITCHEN - DAY \nGary washes the wine glasses, being sure to wash off any trace of lipstick. He dries them and puts them back in the cabinet. \nFaced with the remainder of the wine, he considers dumping it down the sink. Instead, he chugs it from the bottle. \n", "test2_true": "OMIT \nINT. OFFICE / GYM - SUMMER NIGHT \nGary works out hard on the elliptical trainer.    He has his iPod cranked with a POUNDING TUNE. \nHe does abs on a stability ball.   He's spent. \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nGary enters from the driveway door, gulping from a water bottle. He starts to look through the delivery menus when he notices an orange Post-It note by the telephone. It reads: \nLook for the Nines. \nHe picks it up, looks at the back.   Nothing.    Sticks it back down on the counter. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nGary sits on the couch with his water bottle, listening to the baby monitor: Sarah is singing a LULLABY. He takes off his shoes and socks. When she's finished... \nSARAH (ON MONITOR) Goodnight, sweetheart. \nGARY Goodnight. \nFor a long beat, it's quiet.   Then we hear RUSTLING. \nA crib toy plays a short MELODY.   Then a slightly-digital voice speaks: \nVOICE The cat says meow! The pig says oink! \nGary smiles to himself. \nVOICE (CONT'D) The cow says moo! The cow says moo! The cow says moo! \nEvidently, Jaden loves the cow. \nVOICE (CONT'D) The dog says, nine. Nine. Nine. Nine. \nGary looks back.     Did he just hear that? \nThe phone RINGS. \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT [CONTINUOUS] \nGary answers it on the third ring. \nGARY Hello. \nIt's the parole system. \nGARY (CONT'D) Yes. Yes. Two trains run through the forest. \nMusic STRIKES. We see a sudden change in Gary's expression. He nearly drops the phone. \nForcing himself not to panic, he pushes the button for speakerphone. He wants to make sure he's hearing it right. \nMALE COMPUTER VOICE Nine.    Nine. Nine. Nine. \nGary backs away from the phone like it might sprout legs and jump on him. Suddenly, he backs into \nSOMEONE ELSE. \nHe spins around, startled. He only catches a glimpse of THE MAN -- same height, same build, same everything. The Man is gone in half an instant, vanished into thin air. \nGary bolts for the door. \nReaching the foyer, Gary steps on a \nRAT TRAP, \nwhich SNAPS down on his toes. He SCREAMS, pulling it off. He looks around to find all eight traps are now on the main floor, rather than the second-floor walkway. \nLimping, he hops out the door.

(\"This fall, Mondays are murder.\") The bench side is a promo poster for a show called Knowing. (\"Some fates are chosen for you.\") \nIt's here we find Gary taking a seat, gingerly checking his toes where the rat trap snapped. He's hobbled his way here from the house, which is probably a block away. \nThere's only a little blood, but his toes really hurt. \nOver Gary's shoulder, we see a blonde 8-year old girl (Noelle) watching him with concern. She BANGS on the shelter to get his attention. Gary nearly jumps out of his skin. \nGARY Jesus!   You scared the shit out of... \nShe signs \"What's wrong?\" \nGARY (CONT'D) (confused) What? \nNOELLE (signed, subtitled) You're hurt. GARY I don't speak that.   Sorry.   I don't... \nShe points to his toes.   Getting what she must mean... \nGARY (CONT'D) I'm fine.    I'll be fine. \nLooking around, he realizes that the little girl is out here by herself. \nGARY (CONT'D) Where are your parents? \nShe looks at him oddly, not really getting the question. \nGARY (CONT'D) Your mom, your dad. Where are they? \nNOELLE (signed, subtitled) Mom is at the car. Where you left her. Again, Gary has no idea what she's saying. \nNOELLE (CONT'D) (signed, subtitled) You're lost. GARY Look, you need to go back, okay? You shouldn't be out here. It's not safe. \nNoelle glances to her left. \nWe hear BWOOP BWOOP as a police cruiser pulls over to the curb. \nGARY (CONT'D) Shit. \nWe go to a WIDER ANGLE as TWO OFFICERS get out of the car.

He's reserving the right to remain silent. \nMARGARET (PRE-LAP) Once again, the idea of house arrest is you stay inside your house. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - DAY \nThe same parole officer from earlier attaches a black anklet to Gary's left leg. We see that Gary's left foot also features bandaged toes. \nMARGARET Think of it like an electronic leash. Basically, if you ever go more than 100 feet from the base station... \nShe points to an electronic device by the wall. \nMARGARET (CONT'D) ...the cops come, they throw your ass in jail. If you ever try to take it off, the cops come and throw your ass in jail. And if they ever detect drugs or alcohol in your system... \nGARY ...the cops come and throw my ass in jail. \nMARGARET No. I kick your ass. Then the cops come and throw your ass in jail. \nThe parole officer smiles. \nGARY Do I still have to answer the phone? \nMARGARET No, I'll be doing that from now on.

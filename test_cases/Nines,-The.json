All three Garys give each other thumbs-up. \nDriver-Gary looks out the driver-side window, where he sees shoes and asphalt. Only now do we ROTATE to reveal we're \nB113                                                                  B113 UPSIDE-DOWN. \nGary has rolled the car. \nThe music suddenly STOPS.    We hear SIRENS approaching. \nCUT TO BLACK. \nTITLE OVER: \nPart One: THE PRISONER \nFADE IN: \nINT. COURTHOUSE PROCESSING AREA - DAY \nMARGARET O'REILLY, 34, is speaking to herself. \nMARGARET La la la la la. Like you've never done worse. \nFrom a NEW ANGLE, we see she's using a cell phone earpiece. \nMARGARET (CONT'D) Okay, yes. He totalled a car. But it was an environmentally friendly car. Why doesn't that get reported? \nA beat. \nMARGARET (CONT'D) Please! He was heartbroken, betrayed. You say you understand but you don't. You can't. You're like a big giant Vulcan. \nNoticing something to her right... \nMARGARET (CONT'D) He's coming. I'll call you later. \nShe hangs up, wrapping the earpiece around her phone.   We reveal \nGARY \nbeing escorted through glass doors by a polo-shirted PAROLE OFFICER. Margaret moves to intercept them, offering a hand. \nMARGARET (CONT'D) Hi.    Margaret. I work for Lola. \nGARY Gary. \nMARGARET I know. (to the Parole Officer) We need to go out the back. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BACK HALLWAY - DAY \nMargaret leads the way.      She's been here before. \nGARY Are there reporters out front? \nMARGARET A few. Not Hugh Grant level. More like Robert Downey, Jr. when he broke into that family's house and slept in the kid's bed like Goldilocks. \"This bed is just right.\" I handled episodes two through four for Robert. This sort of thing is my specialty. \nGARY What is? \nMARGARET Famous fuck-ups. Don't worry. Mama's gonna take good care of you. \nA phone RINGS. \nCUT TO: \nINT. KITCHEN - DAY \nA designer kitchen in Hancock Park -- spacious and kosher- ready. The phone on the counter is RINGING. \nGARY I don't do heroin. \nMARGARET Yeah, crack is classy. And I'm not buying you porn. There's spray-per- view on cable. \nGARY Good. I really wasn't concerned about my career, my family or my future. I just wanted to jack off. \nMargaret is a little impressed by this show of backbone. \nMARGARET Let me see your phone. \nHe hands over his cell phone.   She drops it in the contraband box. \nGARY C'mon!   All my numbers are in that. \nMARGARET Dial ten digits at random. Whoever answers will be better than the people on this phone. \nShe picks up the liquor box, ready to go. \nMARGARET (CONT'D) You have my cell number. You have delivery menus. You're fine. Right? \nGARY I guess. \nAs she leaves, Margaret notices a long butane lighter by the stove. She adds it to the box, just to be sure. \nTIME CUT TO: \nINT. HOUSE / VARIOUS - DAY \nGary paces around his new home, trying to get a feel for it. \nHe plays a few NOTES on the piano. \nHe looks up at the painting over the staircase:    a cliff near the ocean. \nHe opens random drawers in a Chinese herb cabinet, wondering if there's anything hidden in one of the 46 slots. There isn't. \nHe takes a long beat to consider three paintings in the dining room, which show the same thing in three different ways. \nEXT. BACKYARD - SUMMER NIGHT \nGary swims laps, trying to exhaust himself. \nHe stands in the shallow end, listening to the quiet. \nINT. KITCHEN - SUMMER NIGHT \nWearing a fluffy white robe, he looks through the delivery menus. \nINT. FOYER / FRONT DOOR - SUMMER NIGHT \nHe takes a bag of food from a college-age DELIVERY GUY, who seems to recognize him. Gary pays him, shuts the door. \nAs he's walking to the kitchen with the food, Gary looks back and sees the Delivery Guy watching him from the front walk. The guy is a little embarrassed, but Gary is pretty used to being stared at. \nINT. KITCHEN - SUMMER NIGHT \nGary unwraps the Thai food.   Makes himself a plate. \nHe watches CRIME LAB on the plasma screen while eating dinner. \nGARY (O.S. TV DIALOGUE) Once we get these samples back to the Crime Lab, we'll know who the real killer is. \nINT. LIBRARY / TV ROOM - NIGHT \nGary scans the shelves, looking for something to read. There are five times more books here than Gary has opened in his lifetime. \nHe settles on a paperback of Voltaire's Candide. \nHe lies back on the couch, reading it. \nHe flips a few pages ahead to see if it gets more interesting. A beat. \nCUT TO: \nGARY JACKING OFF \nto soft-core pay-per-view. We're CLOSE ON Gary's straining face, but we can hear the pleasured MOANS of the actresses as they go down on each other. \nNearing climax, he looks for something to come on.     He can't find anything. \n(A practiced ear notices a Canadian accent.) \nWOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D) Over here. To your left. (correcting) Right. Sorry. Right. \nHe follows the voice to a gap in the hedges at the far corner of the yard, finding SARAH GLEASON. Late 30's, fresh- scrubbed and girlish, she looks more fragile than she really is. \nSARAH I'm working on my putting, if you can believe it. \nIndeed, she's holding a putter. \nGARY Not really. \nSARAH Okay. Maybe I was just looking for a way to meet my infamous neighbor. You see, I'm under house arrest, too. \nGARY What did you do? \nSARAH I had sex with my husband. \nGARY That's awful. \nSARAH Nine months later, I had Jaden. That's her over there. \nShe points to a small portable baby monitor. \nGARY She's cute. \nSARAH She's sleeping for another... (checks watch) ...seventeen minutes. She keeps to a schedule. \nGARY She sounds really boring. \nSARAH (whispers) She is. \nA beat.   A smile between them. \nGARY You're rich. Shouldn't you have a nanny from Ecuador? \nSARAH I'm Canadian. \nGARY (as if that explains it) Ohhh... \nSARAH I can't work in the U.S. Plus, I want to maintain this air of moral superiority by doing everything myself. \nGARY Very Canadian. \nSARAH Thanks. \nAnother pregnant pause. \nSARAH (CONT'D) Listen, Jaden goes down again at 2:30. Maybe I could stop by. \nGARY I'm pretty sure I'll be here. \nSARAH It's a date. \nGARY Is it? \nShe picks up the baby monitor, heading back into her house. Suddenly, she realizes... \nSARAH Oh.   I'm Sarah, by the way. \nGARY Gary. \nSARAH Yeah.    I know. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BATHROOM - DAY \nGary brushes his teeth and tongue. \nOMIT \nINT. KITCHEN - DAY \nGary neatens up, tossing out newspapers and delivery boxes. He plumps pillows. \nHe looks up at the clock:      2:30. \nHe sits, trying to read Candide again.     He fidgets. \nMUSIC begins, providing backing to her monologue. \nSARAH I'll never forget the look on my father's face as he gathered me up in his arms and raced through the burning building, out onto the pavement. \nON GARY, feeling bad he brought this up, but fascinated at the same time. \nSARAH (CONT'D) I stood there shivering in my pajamas and watched the whole world go up in flames. And when it was all over, I said to myself, \"Is that all there is to a fire?\" Is that all there is? \nAs she starts to SING, Gary realizes the story isn't hers at all. It's Peggy Lee's \"Is That All There Is.\" \nSARAH (CONT'D) Is that all there is, is that all there is? If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing. \nShe leans closer. \nSARAH (CONT'D) Let's break out the booze and have a ball. If that's all there is. \nStanding up, Sarah takes Gary's hands, pulling him off the couch. She leads him to an open area -- more space for dancing. \nSARAH (CONT'D) Is that all there is, is that all there is? If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing. Let's break out the booze and have a ball, If that's all there is. \nCUT TO: \nOMIT \nINT.   SARAH'S BATHROOM - DAY [MONOLOGUE] \nSarah leans up to the mirror, trying to get her contacts in. It's not going well. Her eyes are tearing up. \nSARAH Then I fell in love with the most wonderful boy in the world. We would take long walks by the river or just sit for hours gazing into each other's eyes. We were so very much in love. Then one day he went away and I thought I'd die. But I didn't. And when I didn't, I said to myself, \"Is that all there is to love?\" \nINT.   LIVING ROOM - DAY \nSarah and Gary start to dance. \nSARAH Is that all there is? Is that all there is? If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep... \nINT. ANTIQUE HARDWARE STORE - DAY \nDeep in the bowels of the store, Sarah is surrounded by vintage lighting fixtures. She's (futilely) trying to match a specific light switch plate. \nTO CAMERA: \nSARAH I know what you're thinking. If that's the way she feels about it why doesn't she just end it all? I'm in no hurry for that final disappointment. I know just as well as I'm standing here talking to you, when that final moment comes and I'm breathing my last breath, I'll be saying to myself... \nINT.   LIVING ROOM - DAY \nSarah and Gary become more intimately acquainted on the couch. They still haven't kissed, but hands are running up and down over clothing. Sarah isn't singing anymore, though her voice continues. \nSARAH'S VOICE Is that all there is, is that all there is? If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing. Let's break out the booze and have a ball, If that's all there... \nJust as they're about to kiss, \nA BABY HOWLS. \nIt's the monitor, HISSING and POPPING as Jaden wakes up from her nap, cranky and hungry. Sarah pushes back. Gary tries to close the gap, but she's already standing up. \nSARAH I need to... \nGARY Just... \nSARAH My shoes.     Are here.     Okay. \nAs she reaches for one, she knocks over a wine glass. \nSARAH (CONT'D) Crap! \nGARY Don't worry about it.         Just... \nSARAH I'm going.     Bye. \nCarrying both her shoes, she's across the room and out the front door before he can say anything more. \nCUT TO: \nINT. KITCHEN - DAY \nGary washes the wine glasses, being sure to wash off any trace of lipstick. He dries them and puts them back in the cabinet. \nFaced with the remainder of the wine, he considers dumping it down the sink. Instead, he chugs it from the bottle. \nHEADLIGHTS FLARE as cars travel down Miracle Mile, bringing us to a Metro Bus stop -- a semi-enclosed bench with backlit signage. \nThe far side of the shelter has a one-sheet for Crime Lab. (\"This fall, Mondays are murder.\") The bench side is a promo poster for a show called Knowing. (\"Some fates are chosen for you.\") \nIt's here we find Gary taking a seat, gingerly checking his toes where the rat trap snapped. He's hobbled his way here from the house, which is probably a block away. \nThere's only a little blood, but his toes really hurt. \nOver Gary's shoulder, we see a blonde 8-year old girl (Noelle) watching him with concern. She BANGS on the shelter to get his attention. Gary nearly jumps out of his skin. \nGARY Jesus!   You scared the shit out of... \nShe signs \"What's wrong?\" \nGARY (CONT'D) (confused) What? \nNOELLE (signed, subtitled) You're hurt. GARY I don't speak that.   Sorry.   I don't... \nShe points to his toes.   Getting what she must mean... \nGARY (CONT'D) I'm fine.    I'll be fine. \nLooking around, he realizes that the little girl is out here by herself. \nGARY (CONT'D) Where are your parents? \nShe looks at him oddly, not really getting the question. \nGARY (CONT'D) Your mom, your dad. Where are they? \nNOELLE (signed, subtitled) Mom is at the car. Where you left her. Again, Gary has no idea what she's saying. \nNOELLE (CONT'D) (signed, subtitled) You're lost. GARY Look, you need to go back, okay? You shouldn't be out here. It's not safe. \nNoelle glances to her left. \nWe hear BWOOP BWOOP as a police cruiser pulls over to the curb. \nGARY (CONT'D) Shit. \nWe go to a WIDER ANGLE as TWO OFFICERS get out of the car. Gary looks back. \nNoelle is gone, though there's really nowhere she could have disappeared. \nPutting on his best face for the police... \nGARY (CONT'D) Evening, officers. \nCUT TO: \nB160                                                                B160 INT./EXT.   POLICE CRUISER - NIGHT \nHandcuffed, Gary is placed in back.     He's reserving the right to remain silent. \nMARGARET (PRE-LAP) Once again, the idea of house arrest is you stay inside your house. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - DAY \nThe same parole officer from earlier attaches a black anklet to Gary's left leg. We see that Gary's left foot also features bandaged toes. \nMARGARET Think of it like an electronic leash. Basically, if you ever go more than 100 feet from the base station... \nShe points to an electronic device by the wall. \nMARGARET (CONT'D) ...the cops come, they throw your ass in jail. If you ever try to take it off, the cops come and throw your ass in jail. And if they ever detect drugs or alcohol in your system... \nGARY ...the cops come and throw my ass in jail. \nMARGARET No. I kick your ass. Then the cops come and throw your ass in jail. \nThe parole officer smiles. \nGARY Do I still have to answer the phone? \nMARGARET No, I'll be doing that from now on. I'm moving into the guest room. \nGARY I don't need a babysitter. \nMARGARET Despite all evidence to the contrary. Don't worry, I'm a cool roomie. Who do you think taught Affleck how to gamble? \nMARGARET ...I was born at the wrong time. \nGARY Exactly. \nWe REVERSE to see the object of their awe: a giant inflatable jump-o-rama in the shape of a castle. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE CASTLE - DAY \nVARIOUS SHOTS: Gary and Margaret jump with all their might, bouncing off the walls, SCREAMING all the time. \nWhen both finally collapse, it becomes strangely tranquil. They're safe inside an inflatable paradise. \nGary scoots over beside Margaret.     She puts her head on his arms. It's nice. \nPrelap:   A doorbell RINGS. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   FOYER - DAY \nGary opens the door to find Sarah. \nSARAH Where's the warden? \nGARY Groceries. \nSARAH Quite the little missus. \nShe walks past him, into the house. \nINT.   LIVING ROOM - DAY [CONTINUOUS] \nSarah crosses to the couch, picking up the baby monitor. \nGARY How's Jaden? \nSARAH Boring. We haven't had nearly the grand old time you two have been having. \nThere's an edge to her voice. \nGARY You've been watching. \nSARAH Well. I don't want to meddle in your affairs. \nGARY My affairs? \nSARAH Everyone needs affection.    I get it. \nShe's headed back for the door. \nGARY I don't.    Are you seriously jealous? \nSARAH The opposite. I just want to protect her. \nGARY From what? \nSARAH From you. Look at you. You date models. Actresses. Tennis players. \nGARY Yeah. \nSARAH On a scale of one to ten, you belong with the Nines. We both know you won't settle for less. \nWith that, she's gone. \nCUT TO: \nINT. KITCHEN - DAY \nGary is trying to load dishes into the dishwasher, but has a hard time getting one bowl to fit. \nMARGARET What are \"the Nines?\" \nGARY What? \nHe looks over.    Margaret holds up the orange sticky note by the phone. \nMARGARET \"Look for the Nines.\" \nINT.   UPSTAIRS WALKWAY - NIGHT \nMargaret leans out her doorway: \nMARGARET Goodnight, ratface. \nGARY Goodnight. \nINT.   BEDROOM - NIGHT \nGary sits in one of the upholstered chairs, staring at his still-made bed. It's impossible to know what he's thinking, but the wheels are turning. \nEXT. SIDE PATIO - MORNING \nGary opens the newspaper to a page at random.   He starts circling things with a red Sharpie. \nMACRO CLOSE UP.    His pen circles the number nine every time it appears. \nAs he flips the page, he spots Sarah looking in through the rounded trellis, just a few feet away. She's holding her own newspaper, still in the wrapper. \nSARAH Hey neighbor. \nGARY Hi. \nSARAH Sorry for the psychotic episode. I'll blame it on hormones. \nGARY Okay. \nSARAH Are you alright? You look a little Beautiful Mind-ish. \nHe almost deflects it, but decides to trust her: \nGARY How many times should the number nine come up? Probablistically? \nSARAH Probablistically? \nGARY (annoyed) You know what I mean. \nSARAH One time out of ten. \nGARY How about every time? \nHe hands her the paper through the bars. \nGARY (CONT'D) But they only show up when you look for them. Looking for them changes things. \nTrying to find an explanation... \nSARAH Some of these are prices. There's going to be a lot of nines when... \nGARY There is something wrong with the world. \nSarah looks up slowly. She smiles for an uncomfortably long beat. She's stalling, thinking. \nSARAH You have an eyelash on your... here... \nShe steps forward, and motions for him to lean closer to the bars. Brushing off the non-existent eyelash, she WHISPERS: \nSARAH (CONT'D) I can get you out of here.    But you have to trust me. \nMARGARET [O.S.] Morning. \nMARGARET \nenters, carrying her tea. She sees Gary by himself, leaning near the bars of the trellis. \nMARGARET Everything okay? \nGARY Peachy. \nMARGARET Peachy's good. I like peaches. \nWIDER, \nwe see that Sarah is flush back against the wall, out of Margaret's line of sight. \nMARGARET (CONT'D) You want coffee? \nGARY Sure. \nShe sits forward in her chair.    By instinct, he sits back. \nMARGARET Everything is what it is. But you're not who you think you are. \nNEW ANGLE (TIME JUMP) \nGary gets up, headed for the front door. \nMARGARET (CONT'D) God, no!   Please, Gary, don't. \nBut he's already outside. \nEXT.   FRONT WALKWAY - DAY \nHe's walking towards the blue chalk perimeter line, headed for Sarah's house. \nLeaves fall lazily from the trees, counter-point to the tension. \nMargaret calls out from the arched windows. \nMARGARET You don't know what you're doing. \nShe's almost at tears.   He stops at the edge of the chalk line. \nGARY What happens if I cross this line? \nThe tear in her eye falls. \nMARGARET I don't know. But it's not good. \nHe very deliberately steps over the line. We hear a thin BEEPING from the house-arrest anklet. He shoots her a look to say, is that all there is? \nBut the BEEPING grows louder, deeper. It starts to come from all sides, booming, a nuclear-meltdown/self-destruct-sequence- activated DRONE. \nGary suddenly realizes something very, very terrible is about to happen. \nGARY Oh shit. \nThe world ignites in white-hot atomic flames. \nWe see the blinding glare erupt behind Margaret, illuminating through her skin, right to the bone. \nThe same flash catches a leaf in mid-air, sizzling through it like an etched x-ray. \nAs the light hits Gary, we... \nCUT TO BLACK. \nREADER NOTE: Part 2 is a half-hour episode of a Project Greenlight-style documentary series called \"Behind the Screen,\" which tracks the progress of a one-hour TV drama pilot from conception through delivery. In keeping with the genre, it's very fast and cutty. \nINTERVIEW sequences are done to an off- camera interviewer. \nSome scenes are unscripted. The gist of these scenes is summarized in italics. \nTITLES OVER: \nPart Two: REALITY TELEVISION \nCUT TO: \nANIMATED TITLES \nWe RUSH IN on a television set, which spins around revealing a blinding constellation of pixels. \nMELISSA (V.O.) Previously, on \"Behind the Screen.\" \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STUDIO LOT - DAY \nGAVIN TAYLOR (30) walks to a meeting, with his laptop bag over his shoulder. He has a tidy, Banana Republic sensibility and an easy smile that belies his manic schedule. \nSUSAN (V.O.) Gavin Taylor's one of the best TV writers out there. \nINT. SUSAN'S OFFICE - DAY \nCluttered and corporate, with stacks of scripts and a few touches of arbitrary quirk. SUSAN HOWARD (35) and Gavin kiss hello. \nSUSAN (V.O.) Every network would kill to work with him. \nA DRIVER holds up a sign for \"TAYLOR.\" Gavin approaches, waves to him. He has a laptop bag over his shoulder. \nTITLES identify him as: \nGavin Taylor Creator / Showrunner \nINT.   LAUNDRY ROOM / KITCHEN - DAY \nGavin unlocks the door, entering from the driveway. He's hauling a massive wheeled duffle bag. (Note: This is the same house from Part One.) \nWe hear the CLATTER of toenails on hardwood floors.   Gavin kneels down to greet... \nGAVIN Puggies! \nGavin's PUGS pounce all over him. \nINT.   KITCHEN - DAY [MINUTES LATER] \nGavin is on the cordless phone, talking with a friend as he sorts through massive piles of mail. \nOn his left wrist, we notice the same green string bracelet Gary wore in Part One. \nGAVIN (ON PHONE) It's weird being back. It doesn't feel like my house anymore. \nA220                                                                 A220 INT.   FOYER - DAY \nGavin sits at the piano, pecking out a haunting melody he's been fiddling with. He grabs a red diskette and a Sharpie. \nGAVIN (V.O.) At this stage, you have the script you wrote, and the film you shot, but you don't know how it's all going to come together. You just know how you want it to feel. \nHe writes \"Knowing\" on the diskette, and pops it into the Disclavier unit. \nINT. EDITING SUITE - DAY \nSusan, Gavin and the EDITOR watch the cut.   Susan is taking notes on a legal pad. \nJUMP CUT TO: \nSusan flips to her next note.   TITLES list her position as: \nSusan Howard VP, Drama Development \nSUSAN I just don't know if you need the cold open. People want to get right to the story. \nANGLE ON the Editor, bristling a bit. \nINT. HALLWAY - DAY [LATER] \nImpromptu INTERVIEW. \nGAVIN I invited Susan to see a rough cut because I trust her taste. \nINTERCUT editing suite. \nSUSAN Could we be more clear why Mary is so freaked out at that moment? \nGAVIN Wow. I thought it was pretty obvious. And dramatic. \nGAVIN [INTERVIEW] More importantly, I trust her as a barometer of Roger's taste. \nSUSAN I know. But that's Roger's big thing this season. Never let the audience be confused. \nCUT TO: \nINT. EDITING SUITE - [LATER THAT] DAY \nThe Editor hands Melissa a microphone.    TITLES list her simply as: \nMelissa McCarthy \"Mary\" \nGAVIN So we're trying to squeeze in a wild line over this shot of Noelle. \nThe monitor shows a three-second clip. It's Melissa and a eight year-old actress (\"Noelle\") in a car. \nMelissa's character looks alarmed by something the girl has just done or said. \nMELISSA What's the line? \nGAVIN (quickly) How could you... \nGAVIN The guy was crazy. Obviously. The show is kinda twisted, and it just flipped something in him. \nGavin sounds like he's trying to convince himself. \nPRODUCER'S VOICE (O.C.) What did he say? \nGAVIN Oblivio accebit. It's Latin. \"Oblivion approaches.\" \nPRODUCER'S VOICE (O.C.) What do you think it means? \nGAVIN Other than the world is coming to an end? \"Oblivio\" also means forgetting, forgetfulness. (jump cut) I think that's what I'm going to do. Forget it. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nGavin hosts a game night: good friends and lots of cocktails. The guests include Melissa and Susan, along with SAM, TOM, BRUCE, DANA, JON, KEVIN, JEFF, DAN, and CARL. (We don't show anyone's names.) \nThey're playing Celebrity. We go several rounds, keeping the best of what's said. \nCUT TO: \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nBetween rounds of Celebrity, party-goers mingle. Gavin is making a new batch of cocktails -- he obviously has a knack for it. \nSusan pours herself another glass of chardonnay. \nSUSAN Did you have a chance to look at the cards yet? \nGAVIN From the screening? \nMelissa reaches in, grabbing the vodka. \nMELISSA Pardon me.      Daddy needs his drink. \nShe makes a quick Cape Cod.            From the other room, Sam YELLS: \nSAM (O.S.) Woman, where's my cocktail! \nMELISSA (yelling back) I'm a-comin! (to Gavin) I still love you most. \nShe gives him a quick peck, then dashes off with Sam's drink. \nSUSAN (continuing her thought) People write stuff on the cards they won't say in a focus group. They get more specific. \nHe SHAKES the mixer. \nSUSAN (CONT'D) Roger has this advice I always remember. (MORE) \nSUSAN (CONT'D) Forget about anyone who scores you in the Twos and Threes. They'll never like your show. \nGavin pours. \nSUSAN (CONT'D) Instead, look for the Nines. \nGAVIN The Nines. \nSUSAN They're the one who think your show is almost the best thing they've ever seen. They get your vision. They just want it to be even better. \nMelissa YELLS from the living room: \nMELISSA Round two is starting without you! \nSUSAN So you'll look at the cards? \nGAVIN Absolutely. \nMaking his way back to the living room, he stops by the phone. Pulls out an orange Post-It and makes a note. \nAs he leaves, we go in CLOSE to read it: \nLOOK FOR THE NINES \nCUT TO: \nINT. SUSAN'S OFFICE - DAY \nINTERVIEW. \nINT. SUSINA - DAY [LATER] \nDahlia is gone.           INTERVIEW with Gavin. \nGAVIN I see why the network loves her. It's just, I wrote the part for Melissa. She's one of my best friends. And in my head, I only see Melissa for the role. (jump cut) Could Dahlia do it? Absolutely. It could work. I just don't know if I want it to work. \nOMIT \nINT. PC BANG - NIGHT \nA empty storefront in Koreatown, both walls lined with computers for the CUSTOMERS playing high-end videogames.                                 We see Gavin playing. \nHis INTERVIEW is intercut with his intense focus on the screen as he plays \"Bad Day L.A.\" \nGAVIN When I get stressed out, I play videogames. It's my therapy. I can't have them on my own computer, because then I'd never write. So I come down to Koreatown. (jump cut) (MORE) \nGAVIN (CONT'D) Videogames are better than real life. When you get stuck, you can always hit `reset.' Life needs a reset button. \nINT. KITCHEN - DAY \nGavin's on the phone. \nGAVIN If we're really going to replace Melissa, I want to hear it from Roger. \nINT. SUSAN'S OFFICE - DAY \nSusan talks to the speakerphone. \nINTERCUT GAVIN \nSUSAN Roger's on a flight to London. But I talked with him before he left. He said yes on Dahlia. \nGAVIN What does that mean? \nSUSAN It means yes. \nGAVIN Yes, replace Melissa? \nSUSAN He wants your show on the air, starring Dahlia. I just got off the phone with her agents. They love it. She loves you. \nGAVIN What about Melissa? \nSUSAN You want me to call her agents? \nGAVIN God no.    I'll tell her. \nGavin hangs up.   We stay on his side of the conversation. \nIn the background, we see the door to the driveway swing open by itself. \nA beat later, it SLAMS shut. \nGavin is understandably startled. \nCUT TO: \nOMIT \nINT. REHEARSAL STUDIO - DAY \nMelissa, wearing a nun's habit, sings \"As Long As He Needs Me.\" A PIANIST is rehearsing with her. \nMELISSA As long as he needs me, I know where I must be... \nINTERCUT with on-camera INTERVIEW: \nMELISSA (CONT'D) In-between the pilot and the series, I'm trying to squeeze in a one-woman show. (edit) I've always been obsessed with nuns. They're sort of like God's fag-hags. \nMelissa spots Gavin entering and sings the rest of the song to him. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. WEST HOLLYWOOD BAR - NIGHT \nGavin and Melissa have martinis. \nGAVIN I think my house is haunted. \nMELISSA Your house is really old. \nShe didn't mean to get on that tangent... \nMARGARET (CONT'D) What's important is that you, you're the big cheese. El Supremo. You could destroy the world with a single thought. (suddenly) Don't, incidentally. Just file that away. But the truth is, you hold all the cards: every church, every candle, every sacrifice -- that's for you. When people pray, they're not praying because they want this thing or that thing. They just don't want to be forgotten. \nMARGARET (CONT'D) So you understand, I would have told you earlier, but I didn't... \nGARY Yeah. \nMARGARET Okay. \nGARY I understand. But I don't believe you. \nHe gets up to exit. (This is where we jump-cut time earlier.) \nFREEZE FRAME. \nFADE TO BLACK. \nTITLE OVER BLACK: \nPart Three: KNOWING \nFADE IN: \nEXT. MEADOW - DAY \nIn a WIDE SHOT, we see a vast field, bordered by green mountains. Unseen BIRDS call out from the trees, while insects CLICK and WHIRR. \nIn the distance, we spot swatches of bright colors moving our way. It's a family: father GABRIEL (34), wife MARY (33) and daughter NOELLE (8). They're returning from a short day hike. Mary carries a small videocamera. \nSeeing that Noelle is already a ways down the path... \nGABRIEL Noelle!   Don't get too far ahead. \nNoelle turns around. Instead of speaking, she moves her hands in sign language. (She's mute, not deaf.) \nMARY No.   You had ice cream at lunch. \nNoelle begs to differ.   More signing. \nGABRIEL (to Mary) Apparently frozen yogurt doesn't count. \nMARY I'll make note. \nEXT. SMALL GRAVEL ROAD - DAY \nThe family walks up to their car, a blue Toyota Prius. Gabriel sheds his daypack, trying to open the hatchback.    It won't lift. \nMary goes to open the passenger door.      Locked. \nMARY Did you hit it? \nGABRIEL Shouldn't have to. \nHe fishes the keys out of his pocket.     Presses the remote entry button repeatedly. \nGabriel tries to open the driver's side door.      Locked.   Even Noelle knows something's wrong. \nGabriel pulls the small mechanical key out of the fob. Unlocks the door and climbs in. Opens the door for Mary and Noelle. \nGABRIEL (CONT'D) I think we left the overhead light on. \nHe taps it.   Moves the switch. \nMARY Shit. \nNoelle signs her made-up representation of \"shit.\" \nMARY (CONT'D) Noelle. \nGabriel slides the key into the slot.     Hits \"START.\" Nothing. \nGABRIEL Battery is dead. Least the starter is. \nNoelle leans forward, aware that this is something serious. \nMARY How do we...? \nGABRIEL We call the service.     That's all we can do. \nIn VARIOUS SHOTS, we get a sense of the distance he's travelling. He passes gulches, meadows and boulder fields. \nHe finally arrives at the junction of the dirt road and a larger... \nEXT. PAVED ROAD - DAY [CONTINUOUS] \nPulling out Mary's cell phone, Gabriel tries to get a signal. By his reaction, it's still iffy. \nHe dials, but the call drops.    Tries again.   Just the same. \nHe looks left.   Looks right.    Looks back down the dirt road. \nHe decides to head off to the right, downhill. \nEXT. FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD - DAY \nWe catch up to Gabriel as he's walking in the middle of the road, still trying unsuccessfully to get a signal. \nIn the distance, he spots a patch of moving color: a female hiker. A moment's hesitation, then he YELLS out to her: \nGABRIEL Excuse me!     Hi! Hello? \nShe stops, turns. \nGabriel jogs to close the distance. As we approach, we reveal SIERRA, 38. In the past 10 years, she's \"made a fresh start\" 12 times. In this incarnation, she's a wilderness- loving, Bush-hating, wildly-overeducated clerk at Trader Joe's in Venice. \nGABRIEL (CONT'D) Excuse me.     Do you have a cell phone? \nSIERRA No, I don't. There's no service up here. \nGABRIEL (re: his phone) Yeah, I'm finding that out. \nSIERRA You can usually get a signal up at the ranger station. \nGABRIEL Okay... \nShe points in the opposite direction -- back the way he came. \nSIERRA You follow the road. It's probably... I don't know. You have a car? \nGABRIEL It's dead.     That's why I need... \nSIERRA Oh... \nShe pulls a stray hair back from her mouth.       Notices him noticing her. \nGABRIEL Yeah. \nA beat.   She takes a subtle step closer to the center of the road. \nGABRIEL (CONT'D) Are you headed back to your car now? If you could give me a ride to a gas station, wherever... \nShe doesn't leap to extend an invitation.        It takes a beat for Gabriel to figure out why. \nGABRIEL (CONT'D) Oh. Hey. Look, I'm not some crazy Ted Bundy guy. I'm not going to rape you or kill you or anything. \nShe doesn't seem reassured. \nGABRIEL (CONT'D) Of course, that's what Ted Bundy would say. Look, I'm a videogame designer. (fishing through wallet) My wife is an editor. My daughter is four. \nHe offers her a family photo.     She looks at it, but doesn't take it. \nGABRIEL (CONT'D) They're waiting back at the car, and I want to get some help before it gets dark. \nSIERRA I can call somebody when I get to town. \nTrying to temper his frustration... \nGABRIEL I believe you. I do. But you don't know where the car is. And the guy might not come. We can't be up here all night. \nSierra backs away. \nSIERRA I'm sorry. \nGABRIEL Don't be sorry. Just help me out here. \nSIERRA No.   I can't. I'm sorry. \nOnce she feels she's reached a good distance, she turns and keeps walking. \nGabriel walks with Sierra. The trees here are taller, creating a cathedral-like ceiling above them. \nSIERRA Okay, confession.    I kind of recognized you. \nGABRIEL Really? \nSIERRA I wasn't sure, but I think I saw a picture of you in some videogame magazine my boyfriend had. You're, like, the shit. \nGABRIEL No. \nSIERRA You're like the Quentin Tarantino of that world. A videogame God. \nGABRIEL Not really. \nSIERRA Fine. \nGABRIEL You seriously recognized me off of one photo? \nSIERRA I thought you were kinda hot. Considering. \nGABRIEL Considering..? \nSIERRA Within the subset of videogame people. \nGABRIEL Okay. \nSIERRA I wasn't masturbating to your picture or anything. \nGABRIEL Well, I guess I'm flattered. \nSIERRA You should be. I'm stingy with compliments. \nGABRIEL So your boyfriend plays videogames? \nSIERRA Ex-boyfriend. And yes. Way too many. He used to play Evercrack back in the day, but yours, well, that was like...what's worse than crack? \nGABRIEL Super-crack? \nSIERRA Sure.   He was this orc witch doctor guy. \nGABRIEL Shaman? \nSIERRA Yeah. At one point he was spending like, 40 hours a week gathering \"thunderleaf\" or whatever. (MORE) \nSIERRA (CONT'D) Then I was his mule, hauling it around because he ran out of space. \nGABRIEL You had an account? \nSIERRA I was part of your world, and you didn't even know it. \nGABRIEL Sorry. \nSIERRA You can make it up to me. \nEXT. ROAD NEAR PRIUS - DAY \nMary is pacing -- but trying not to look like she's pacing. She holds the other cell phone (Gabriel's), which she turns on and off, hoping that somehow she'll get a signal. \nEach time she turns it on, we hear the CHIMES. \nIN THE PRIUS \nNoelle is still playing with the video camera, watching footage of the hike. She decides to wind back further. \nCLOSE ON the blocky pixels rushing past. \nNoelle hits \"play.\"   For now, we just hear the audio. \nMAN'S VOICE ...I have five seasons mapped out, and though it sucks, either you go away, or the show goes. I had to make a decision, and that's the decision I made. I'm sorry. \nWe reveal the screen. We're watching the argument between Gavin and Melissa from Part 2. \nMELISSA (ON TAPE) So it's done. Finished. Decided. \nGAVIN (ON TAPE) Yeah. \nConfused, Noelle looks out at her mother, Mary, who is still pacing with the cell phone. \nMELISSA (ON TAPE) I understand. \nNoelle doesn't look up. \nMARY (CONT'D) I was thinking we could all go to El Cholo for dinner. How would you feel about some blue corn enchiladas? Should we ask Daddy when he gets back? \nWithout looking up... \nNOELLE He's not coming back. \nMary is stunned. For her part, Noelle seems to have no idea she just spoke her first words. \nWe hear three evenly-spaced BEEPS.    After the third one, Mary says: \nMARY How could you... \nMary flinches.    It's like someone walked over her grave. \nNoelle hands her the camera. The footage is cued to earlier in Part 2, where Gavin is having Melissa loop in a wild line: \nMELISSA (ON TAPE) Howkajew. How could you. How could you. (MORE) \nMELISSA (ON TAPE) (CONT'D) (beat) I feel so dirty. \nGAVIN (ON TAPE) That's how I like ya. \nMary backs out of the car, as if trying to get away from the video camera. But she's still holding it. \nShe hits STOP.   Tries to collect herself. \nNoelle gets out of the car, but doesn't approach.      She signs, \"Mommy?\" \nMary backs away. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.   FOREST VALE - DAY \nGabriel and Sierra stop for a moment, so he can pull off his outer shirt. For the first time, we see that Gabriel has a large tattoo on his back which looks like this: \nIX He's sweating a lot. \nGABRIEL Am I crazy, or is it getting hotter? \nSIERRA Oh, you're crazy. \nShe hands him back the water bottle.   He gladly drinks. \nWhen she takes the bottle back, she steps forward. The motion leaves them face-to-face. She pauses for a moment, just long enough for him to turn away. \nHe doesn't. \nShe kisses him. He doesn't really kiss back -- but he doesn't fight it, either. \nShe puts a hand on his thigh, sliding up the inside.     Only when she reaches his crotch does he pull back. \nGABRIEL I have a wife. And a daughter. They're waiting for me. \nSIERRA Where are they? \nGABRIEL Back at the car. \nSIERRA I mean, which direction? \nGABRIEL They're back... \nGabriel turns, trying to get his bearing.      The trees BLUR. He nearly falls over. \nHe manages to steady himself. \nSIERRA Face it, G.: You don't know where they are. You don't know where you are. We've been walking in circles for an hour. \nGABRIEL Where's your car? \nSIERRA There is no car. That was all a... (what's the word) \"pretense,\" I guess. An excuse to get you alone. \nWobbling, Gabriel sits down on a stump.   Sierra kneels down in front of him. \nSIERRA (CONT'D) Dizzy, huh? It's probably just the GHB. In the water. \nShe holds up the water bottle. \nAGITATED MAN You forgot this wasn't real. \nINT./EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS - DAY \nS. We couldn't just storm in on a fiery chariot. It's your universe. We had to play by your rules. We had to make you see how limited and corrupt your little world was. Don't get me wrong, this world is nice. It's cozy. But do you remember where you came from? \nA few beats while it comes back to him. Tears start to build in his eyes. What he's picturing is unspeakably beautiful. \nG. It was warm. And white.    Like... \nx160                                                               x160 INT.

GRAVEL ROAD / NEAR THE PRIUS - DAY \nMary is sitting on the road. Noelle has her chin on her mother's shoulder, watching the videotape with her. \nON SCREEN, with tinny audio: (from scene 177) \nMARGARET You could destroy the world with a single thought. (suddenly) Don't, incidentally. Just file that away. But the truth is, you hold all the cards: every church, every candle, every sacrifice -- that's for you.

She realizes Noelle isn't watching over her shoulder anymore. \nMary looks around.    Her daughter is nowhere to be seen. \nMARY Noelle?    Noelle! \nCUT TO: \nEXT.   FOREST CROSSROADS - DAY \nGabriel and Sierra are back at the junction where the paved road meets the gravel road. \nGABRIEL Maybe if I just cut back, didn't get so involved... \nSIERRA We both know that'll never work. Next week, you'll be back here redesigning the pinecones. You have to quit cold-turkey. \nGABRIEL I can't. \nSIERRA You can. But I can't force you to leave. You have to want it. \nShe takes his hand, running a finger through the green string bracelet around his wrist. \nShe kisses him.   And then she's gone. \nGabriel stands there for a long beat, considering his decision. \nx103                                                                x103 OMIT \nEXT.   GRAVEL ROAD / NEAR THE PRIUS - DAY \nPanicking, Mary calls out for -- \nMARY Noelle!   Noelle! \nShe's nowhere to be found.     Then, from behind her... \nGABRIEL She's here. \nGabriel is walking up the gravel road, with Noelle holding his hand. \nGABRIEL Worst-case scenario? Spontaneous disintegration into a fiery void. Oblivio accebit. The end of everything. \nMARY That's all? \nBoth smile. \nGABRIEL That probably wouldn't happen. The basic structure of the universe should hold. I guess I'm just worried about the human factor. You guys kill each other a lot. \nMARY In fairness, that's usually in your name. Plus we've gotten much more efficient at it. \nA beat. \nGABRIEL I like this world. I like my life, here, with you and Noelle... \nMARY But it's not real. I'm not really your wife, you're not really my husband. On some level, it's all pretend. \nGABRIEL It's not pretend. There's a reason you were there, in every version. You were my sister, my wife, my best friend... \nMARY That's a little creepy. \nGABRIEL I wanted you close. In one version, I even told you. I warned you that some day they might come for me, and... \nMARY ...You'd have to leave.   How many versions were there? \nGABRIEL Ninety.   This is the last one. \nMARY Wow. \nGABRIEL I've destroyed billions of people with a thought. Obliterated them. And you'd like to think it's painless... \nMARY Stop. You don't have to explain, or apologize. Everything that is, is because of you. If that's all, that's enough. \nWith that, there's really nothing more to say. \nMARY (CONT'D) So. \nGABRIEL So. \nMARY Guess you don't really need to pack anything. \nGABRIEL I'm good. \nMARY You're great. It's been a pleasure. \nGABRIEL Likewise.    I love you. \nMARY Love you, too. Ya big lug. \nHe kisses her. It's not a big, passionate, movie-ending kiss, but rather a fond kiss farewell. At the end of it, he WHISPERS into her ear: \nGABRIEL You're my favorite. \nShe smiles. \nWith two fingers, Gabriel BREAKS the green string bracelet around his left wrist. \nAnd in that moment, a film passes over him, like the boundary between water and air. \nHe's stepped out of this dimension. \nMary is frozen with the same smile on her face, but we notice that she and the kitchen around her have flattened out to two- dimensional images. \nShe and everything around her has become like wallpaper, slowly curling away, revealing emptiness beneath. \nGabriel collapses into a single, spiky sphere of light. \nThe light moves through the kitchen, creating waves that ripple through the tissue-thin walls. \nPicking up speed, the sphere rushes through the window, heading west. \nEXT.   LOS ANGELES - DAY \nAs the light flies out over Hancock Park, the mansions and skyscrapers seem unreal, like models. \nReaching Santa Monica, we pass over the ferris wheel at the end of the pier. \nWe dive into the blue ocean beneath us, which becomes only a swirling gray fog with a viscous thickness. \nWe see three lights in the distance.    We join them, moving with them. \n", "test1_input": "THE NINES \nWritten by \nJohn August \nFINAL SCRIPT \nNovember 2006 \nREADER NOTE \nOne thing that will be obvious to viewers, but not to readers, is that the nine principal parts in this film are played by only three actors: \n1) Gary, Gavin, Gabriel \n2) Sarah, Susan, Sierra \n3) Margaret, Melissa, Mary \nIt'll make more sense in context. Promise. \nA MAN'S HAND \nunwinds a short length of green string. We're extremely close, with a shallow, blurry focus. It's like the first moments after a dream -- just fragments. \nScissors cut the string. The man wraps it around his left wrist. A loop. A bracelet. \nWe see the man's teeth, the edge of his chin as he pulls the knot tight. \nHis fingers pull against the string.   Solid.   It won't break easily. \nFADE OUT. \nPITCH BLACK \nThere's no music. No sound at all, really, except for some distant birds CHIRPING. \nThen a SQUEAK.   A SQUEAL as rusty springs engage. \nA GARAGE DOOR LIFTS, \nrevealing GARY BANKS in silhouette. He's 30, effortlessly fit, with movie-star good looks. (Although for now, he's merely a TV star.) \nLike most Laurel Canyon garages, this one has never held a car. Instead, it's the resting place for all the detritus of bachelordom: shitty Ikea furniture, a drum set, a styrofoam snowman, and the Harley he always meant to get running. \nGary spots what he was looking for. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BACK PATIO / LAUREL CANYON HOUSE - MAGIC HOUR (DAWN) \nGary drags a beaten Weber kettle. One of its wheels is broken, SCRAPING against the deck. \nWIDER, we see Gary's house has an incredible view of the city. He couldn't fucking care less. \nHe yanks the circular grill out of the Weber and throws it down the canyon. \nHe empties a garbage bag into the barbecue: mostly women's clothes, but also some stuffed animals and photos still in their frames. There's too much to fit, so he tries stomping it down with a flip-flopped foot. \nHe cracks open a container of lighter fluid and begins drenching everything inside. He sprays until the container is WHEEZING air. He shakes it, making sure it's really empty. \nThen he cracks open a new container and keeps spraying.   And spraying. \nWe follow the dripping fluid as it runs across a photo of Gary and a BLONDE WOMAN. Her eyes are scratched out, making her unrecognizable. \nUnder the grill, lighter fluid is dripping in a stream, soaking into the wooden deck. \nFinally satisfied, Gary throws the lighter fluid aside. He takes five steps back and pulls a box of matches from his pocket. \nEXTREMELY CLOSE as the match SCRAPES, erupting in flames. \nOn Gary's left wrist, we see a green string bracelet. \nMUSIC STARTS: a pounding, hypnotic track that will carry us through these MAIN TITLES. \nIn EPIC SLOW-MOTION, we follow the burning match as it sails through the air, tumbling end-over-end. \nJust as it's about to reach its target, we... \n", "test1_true": "A DIGITAL METER \nshoots to 100 miles per gallon.

He's now on Sunset Blvd. A matronly black streetwalker (OCTAVIA, 35) approaches the passenger window. \nGary holds up the little bag. \nGARY Is this crack? \nShe takes a closer look. \nGARY (CONT'D) Do you know how to do it? \nCUT TO: \nINT. SHITTY MOTEL ROOM - DAY \nGary and Octavia jump up and down on the bed, each trying to bounce higher than the other, LAUGHING all the while. \nGary bounces so high that he THUNKS his head against the ceiling.

MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nToweling off, Gary looks at his body in the mirror. He notices something odd. He tries to wake Octavia up, but she's down for the count. \nLooking around, he finds his cell phone. Dials 911. Pacing, he tries to sober up while it rings. The far side answers. \nGARY Yes, hello. I'm having a medical situation. Yes. Okay. I don't have a belly button. (explaining carefully) I do not have a belly button where I should, on my belly. And I'm concerned, because I don't know if that's... \nHe sits down on the edge of the bed. \nGARY (CONT'D) Can a person live without a belly button? Because if you think about it, you're born with one. So if you don't have one, you're unborn and it's really hazy whether you're alive or not. I guess I'm wondering: am I alive?

She holds up a one-sec finger to him as she continues her conversation. \nGAVIN I will break your fucking finger. \nSUSAN (to phone) I'll call you back. \nShe hangs up. They look each other in the eye, daring each other to go first. \nSUSAN (CONT'D) Roger wanted to talk to you personally. \nGAVIN Bullshit. \nSUSAN They're only picking up two dramas. \nGAVIN The rest is, what, reality? \nSUSAN You can go mid-season. \nGAVIN You can go to Hell. \nSUSAN Wow. \nShe takes a beat, trying to size him up. \n", "test2_id": 2740, "test3_input": "SUSAN (CONT'D) You think I deliberately sabotaged your show. \nGAVIN Didn't you? \nSUSAN G., I'm on your side. Trust me, I'm the only one who is trying to protect you. \nGAVIN                           SUSAN Protect me from what?   You?    There is so much more going You are psychotic.              on than you... \nGAVIN All I want to know is why. \nSUSAN You want a motive? \nGAVIN Yes. \nSUSAN This isn't \"Crime Lab.\"   No one got murdered. \nGAVIN My show did. So tell me why. \nSUSAN I had to get you away from her. She was holding you back. \nGAVIN Melissa. \nSUSAN You had to give her up. (beat) C'mon, G. If she really mattered, you couldn't have betrayed her so easily. \nGAVIN I didn't. \nSUSAN What, you're the victim? The big Creator can't stand up to one little d-girl? It was your choice. I didn't make you do anything. I mean, do you have any principles? Do you believe in anything but your own ego? \nGAVIN Fuck you. \nSUSAN Your dialogue used to be sharper. Maybe Gatins could do a polish. \nHe suddenly punches her, one hit to the face.   She drops hard. \nGavin takes a step back. \nTasting blood, Susan gets to her knees.   A wry smile. \nSUSAN (CONT'D) Is that all there is? \nIn the background, we see partygoers responding to the blow. Susan gets to her feet. She approaches Gavin, hands open. She's not going to hit him. \nSUSAN (CONT'D) Do you feel like a man? Because I'll tell you a secret. \nShe leans in very close to his ear.   There's a strange intimacy between them. \nSUSAN (CONT'D) (whisper) You're not. \nShe walks away.   CLOSE ON Gavin. \nEXT. MANHATTAN SIDEWALK - DAY \nWe move with Gavin as he walks. He's trying to get away from the camera, but it keeps following him. \nHe reaches a crosswalk. He has to wait for the light. Finally, he looks INTO CAMERA: \nGAVIN Look, I don't want to do this anymore. My show's not going to happen, so this show is over. (MORE) \nGAVIN (CONT'D) Done. Gone. I`m not going to be your fucking puppet. \nOFF-SCREEN VOICE Are you alright? \nGavin looks left, where an African-American woman is waiting for the same crosswalk. (We recognize her as Octavia, the streetwalker from Part One.) \nGAVIN I'm fine. \nOCTAVIA Who were you talking to? \nGavin looks back towards camera, a strange expression. \nMUCH WIDER \nWe see Gavin and the woman on the corner. There's no camera Gavin could have been talking to. He's understandably perplexed: Where did the documentary crew go? \nWas there ever anyone there? \nOur CAMERA style has changed:    instead of handheld and jerky, we're smooth and slow. \nThe MUSIC has completely changed, underscoring a sense of creeping dread. \n", "test3_true": "Only then do we notice something unusual floating above her head: \nA SPHERE OF BLUE LIGHT. \nWIDER, we see that everyone on the street has the same kind of sphere floating a foot above their heads. No one seems to see the lights other than Gavin. \nGavin looks around in uneasy fascination, as if he's just landed on an alien world. \nA beat, then he has an unsettling thought. \nHe slowly looks up. Above his own head, he sees the same sphere of light -- only his is bright white. Pulsing. Blinding. \nGAVIN Oh God. \nWe PULL BACK, RISING UP to a perspective above and behind Gavin. As we do, the edges of the frame creep in, revealing ICONS and unintelligible STATISTICS, changing moment by moment. \nA dialog box appears in the center of the screen, reading... \nExit Now? Unsaved changes will be lost. \n[ Cancel ]          [ Exit ] \nAn arrow slides back and forth between to the two options. Finally it lands on `Exit.' \nA CLICK. \nCUT TO BLACK. \nFADE IN: \nx177                                                                 x177 INT.   LIVING ROOM - DAY [PART ONE] \nWe're continuing an earlier scene from the end of Part One. \nMARGARET I can understand why you're a little confused. \nGARY No.   I'm a lot confused. \nMARGARET Theories? \nGARY This is all a dream. \nMARGARET No. \nGARY I'm in a coma. \nMARGARET (amused) No. \nGARY Then I'm dead. This is Hell, or Purgatorium or something. \nMARGARET Okay, a purgatorium is where Romans vomited. But no. This is as real as anything can be. \nGARY (suspicious) What does that mean? \nShe sits forward in her chair.   By instinct, he sits back. \nMARGARET Everything is what it is. But you're not who you think you are. \nGARY Okay, then. Who am I? \nWith practiced calm... \nMARGARET You're a multi-dimensional being of vast, almost infinite power. You created this world on a whim, and decided to stick around to see how it turned out. You, this body you're in, is just one of your incarnations. Avatars. Call you what you will. \nNot sure he follows... \nGARY Are you saying I'm God? \nMARGARET Technically, no. If God is a ten -- a theoretical ultimate, that-which- no-greater-can-be-imagined -- you're more of a nine. \nGARY So what are you? \nMARGARET Humans are sevens. Monkeys are sixes. \nGARY What are the eights? \nMARGARET Koalas. They're telepathic.    Plus, they control the weather. \n", "test3_id": 2741}

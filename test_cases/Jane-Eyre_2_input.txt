It is teeming with rain. Rochester and Jane run to the front entrance. He holds his jacket around her. Lightning. They reach the dry hearth inside. Thunder. They are both euphoric, breathless, laughing. 
JANE I must go. 
ROCHESTER Good night. Good night. 
He kisses her. They kiss again. Jane will not let him go. 
JANE Good night. 
As Jane runs upstairs she sees Mrs Fairfax, deeply shocked. 
INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - MRS FAIRFAX'S PARLOUR 
Jane wears a lilac gown. Mrs Fairfax is very concerned. 
MRS FAIRFAX Have you accepted him? 
JANE Yes. 
MRS FAIRFAX Well I never would have thought. 
Jane is hurt. 
JANE Am I a monster? Is it so impossible that Mr Rochester should love me? 
MRS FAIRFAX No, I've long noticed that you were a sort of pet of his. But you're so young and so little acquainted with men. I don't want to grieve you child, but let me put you on your guard. Gentlemen in his position... Let's just say they're not accustomed to marry their governesses. Until you are wed, distrust yourself as well as him. Please, keep him at a distance - 
Jane has heard enough. She turns away. 
JANE Thank you. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 85. 
INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE HALL 
Jane, walking through, finds herself in Rochester's arms. She laughs as he raises her off the ground. 
ROCHESTER Is this my pale elf? This sunny faced girl with the radiant eyes? 
JANE It is I, Jane Eyre sir. 
ROCHESTER Soon to be Jane Rochester. 
JANE It can never be, sir. Human beings were not meant to enjoy complete happiness on this earth. It's too much like a fairy tale. 
ROCHESTER (KISSING HER) Let the fairy tale begin. 
INT. DAY. A HABERDASHER'S SHOP. 
Rochester is rolling out reams of beautiful silks. Jane gets more uncomfortable as she looks at them. 
ROCHESTER This morning I wrote to my banker in London to send certain jewels. In a day or two I hope to pour them into you lap - 
JANE Oh, no sir - 
ROCHESTER I will put the diamond chain around your neck myself - 
JANE I don't want jewels - 
ROCHESTER I'll dress you in these satins - 
JANE Then you won't know me. I'll not be Jane Eyre any longer but an ape in a harlequin's jacket. Put them away. 
Jane pushes the silks away. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 86. 
ROCHESTER Well for cool native impudence and pure innate pride, you haven't your equal. 
JANE I'm naturally proud. And hard and flinty. You ought to know what sort of bargain you've made while you've still got time to rescind it. I want only one thing from you, Mr Rochester. 
ROCHESTER And what's that? 
JANE Your regard. 
Jane puts her arm through Rochester's. He smiles. 
ROCHESTER It's your time now, little tyrant but it'll soon be mine and when I have seized you, to have and to hold, I'll attach you to a chain, like this... 
Rochester flicks his watch into the air. 
INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - MRS FAIRFAX'S PARLOUR. 
A summer gale. The moan of the wind sounds almost human. The light is sickly, nightmarish. 
A great box sits on the table, which Jane is opening. Adele, Sophie and Mrs Fairfax are all looking on. Jane pulls out a pearl coloured wedding gown. She is dismayed at its opulence. 
She holds it up to herself. Adele starts to play with the great veil. She wraps it round herself. She becomes caught in it, tangled, distressed. 
INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - JANE'S BEDROOM. 
JANE Adele? 
Jane wakes. There is a candle alight at the end of her bed. Her eyes focus. Her wardrobe is open. Jane is unnerved.

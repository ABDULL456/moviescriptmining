{"train": "INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nEd lies awake in bed.  He is sweaty and nervous.  His eyes are wide-open, blood-shot and tired. \nHe picks up his bedside clock which is ticking loudly.  It is 3:37. \nHe looks over at the other side of the queen-size bed. It is still made. He picks a long, blonde hair from the pillow and examines it curiously. \nThere is a noise outside and Ed gets up to investigate. \nINT. HALLWAY - NIGHT \nEd walks through the dark hallway and into the living room of his small house. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nBy the front door, hanging on the wall, is a framed picture of Eve, Ed's wife. Ed passes by it and looks outside through the window. There is some wind outside, but nothing else. \nINT. BATHROOM \nEd looks longingly at his reflection. Ed Saxon, 45, is a morbid, insecure man. His frustration with his life has tinged his sense of humor with an acerbic bite. His early success, a few publications of his poetry, has given him a professorship at the University. He is well-read, intelligent, a bit pompous and occasionally condescending. But mostly, these qualities are restrained and his outward appearance is a little sorrowful. There is an unquestionable charm about him, and its effect is evident in the people around him. \nHe searches through the medicine cabinet, which is full of women's items, and takes out a Cosco-sized bottle of sleeping pills. He reads the back and takes two. \nHe hears something bang against the front door. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nHe opens the front door and takes a step outside. \nEXT. PORCH - NIGHT \nHe looks down by his feet and finds the morning paper, wrapped in blue plastic, lying on the doormat. He picks it up and goes back inside. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nEd stands helplessly in the empty living room. \nEd's desk sits on one side of the living room, crammed into the corner. He searches quickly through the stuff on the desk and finds a small address book. He finds a name in the book and dials the number. \nSUSIE \n(over phone) \nHello? \nED \nSusie.  Hi, it's Ed.  I'm sorry I woke you up. \nSUSIE \nIs something wrong? \nED \nEve isn't there, is she? \nSUSIE \nNo.  She's not there? \nED \nNo.  She didn't come home after work. \nSUSIE \nOh, no.  Didn't she call or anything? \nED \nNo.  She was supposed to be home around six.  I cooked her dinner. \nSUSIE \nCould she have gone anywhere else? \nED \nI don't think so.  Do you? \nSUSIE \nI don't know. \nED \nI'm a little worried. \nSUSIE \nI bet.  Did you call Harborview? \nED \nNo.  Do you think I should? \nSUSIE \nYeah.  If she got into an accident of something, they would take her there. \nED \nYou don't think that's overreacting? \nSUSIE \nDon't be silly.  Just call them.  It can't hurt. \nED \nAlright.  But if she comes home later and it turns out to be nothing, don't tell her I called the hospital, OK? \nSUSIE \nCall me back. \nED \nAlright. \nHe opens the fridge, looks around and takes the plate of food he made for his wife. He takes off the cellophane and starts to eat. \nHe sits at the table, but after a few more bites, he loses his appetite. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nEd sits at his desk, staring at the phone.  He takes a breath and calls 911. \nOPERATOR \n911 emergency. \nED \nHi.  I don't think this is an emergency. \nOPERATOR \nWhat's the problem? \nED \nMy wife hasn't come home and, I don't know..I wanted to check with the police to see if there was an accident. \nOPERATOR \nWhen was the last time you saw her? \nED \nThis morning.  She was supposed to come home from work, but she didn't. \nOPERATOR \nWhen does she get off work? \nED \nAround six.  Usually. \nOPERATOR \nShe hasn't called since then? \nED \nNo. \nOPERATOR \nDo you have any idea where she might have gone?  Maybe to a friend's house? \nED \nI don't think so.  I called the only place I could think of. \nOPERATOR \nBut you were expecting her home. \nED \nYes.  I cooked dinner. \nOPERATOR \nI could send a police officer to your house. \nED \nDo you think that's necessary?  Maybe I should wait. \nOPERATOR \nUntil when?  It's five in the morning. \nED \nMaybe she went somewhere. \nOPERATOR \nWhere? \nED \nI don't know.  Should I be worried? \nOPERATOR \nI would be. \nED \nYes, I'm worried. \nOPERATOR \nSo, do you want me to send an officer to your house? \nED \nI don't think so.  I think I should wait. \nOPERATOR \nDo you think she's going to come home soon? \nED \nI hope so. \nOPERATOR \nSo do I.  How long are you going to wait? \nED \nA little longer.  I think I may be overreacting.  She might have gone somewhere I can't think of.  Sometimes I worry too much. \nOPERATOR \nWhen she left for work this morning.  She was supposed to come home after work.  I cooked dinner. \nSTEWART \nAnd she made it to work, right? \nED \nYes.  I think so.  I don't know. \nSTEWART \nWhat time does she usually come home?  Around six? \nED \nYes.  Usually. \nSTEWART \nWhat does she look like? \nED \nShe's blonde, straight hair. \nSTEWART \nWhat was she wearing?  Do you remember? \nED \nI think it was a red sweater and a dress. \nSTEWART \nWhat kind of car does she drive? \nED \nA Volvo.  Gray.  '85, I think. \nStewart lets out a sigh of relief. \nSTEWART \nWell, you had me worried. There was a blonde woman involved with a car-jacking around six. Apparently she was hit on the head by one of the perpetrators and then wandered away from the incident in a daze. Nobody's seen her since. When I got the call on the radio, I thought that must have been your wife, but this woman was driving a Pathfinder and was wearing jeans, so it probably wasn't her. You had me worried. \nED \nShe drove a Volvo.  Drives a Volvo. \nSTEWART \nThat's a relief.  Do you know anywhere your wife might have gone? \nED \nI called the only place I could think of.  And I called the hospital. \nSTEWART \nHarborview? \nED \nYes. \nStewart takes a couple of pills from a bottle and takes them, chasing them down with a coffee he has with him. \nSTEWART \nI'm afraid there's not much I can do now. By law, we can't put out a missing persons until 72 hours has elapsed since the last time she was seen. \nED \n72 hours? \nSTEWART \nUsually in these cases, it was something stupid. Maybe she was upset about something, had to get away. Who knows? What I can do is take the license plate number of her car and if it shows up for some reason, we'll give you a call. Do you have your wife's license plate number? \nED \nYes.  Actually, it's easy to remember.  007 FEC. \nSTEWART \nJames Bond. \nED \nRight.  And FEC, For Every Child. \nSTEWART \nAnd what's her name? \nED \nEve.  Eve Saxon. \nSTEWART \nAnd your name? \nED \nEd.  Saxon. \nSTEWART \nLike I said, it was probably something stupid.  Did you have a fight? \nED \nNot at all. \nSTEWART \nWell, you should try to get some sleep and, if she doesn't show up tomorrow, give us a call and we'll see what things look like then. OK? \nHi, this is Detective Derm of the Seattle Police. I was wondering if Mrs Eve Saxon had come into work today, or called in, any word from her. Yes. Since yesterday. Did you see her leave yesterday? Yes. About what time was that? I'm not sure. Is she calls, or comes in, could you please ask her to call me. My number is 734-9722, extension 38. Thank you. Bye. \nHe hangs up. \nDERM \nShe hasn't been in today. \nED \nMy God. \nDERM \nShe hasn't called here at all? \nED \nNo. \nDERM \nAny messages? \nHe points to the answering machine.  It is blinking, full of messages. \nED \nI must have been asleep. \nDERM \nThat happens. \nED \nI was up late last night. \nDERM \nI understand.  Why don't we listen to these messages? \nED \nAlright. \nEd pushes the button on the machine. \nThe first message is from Eve's work. \nCELESTE \n(on machine) \nHi, this is Celeste, calling for Eve. We're worried about you. You don't come in. You don't call. No, seriously, we just want to make sure you're OK. Don't worry about your students. Marie's covering for you. But give us a call, OK? Bye. \nED \nThat's the school where Eve works.  She's a piano teacher at Franklin High. \nThen there's a message for Ed. \nMRS MASTRIONI \n(on machine) \nHello, Mr Saxon. This is Mrs Mastrioni from the University. You didn't show up for your morning class and I'm calling to see if you'll be in for your other classes so that I can make the proper arrangements. I assume you remember how to use the phone. \nED \nDamn. \nDERM \nYou're a teacher too? \nED \nA professor at the University. \nThe next message is Derm. \nDERM \n(on machine) \nHello, this is Detective Derm from the Seattle Police Department... \nDerm takes a small pill box from his overcoat, while the machine plays in the background. \nDERM \nThat's me.  Do you have a glass of water? \nED \nSure. \nEd goes into the - \nINT. KITCHEN \n- and fills a glass for the detective. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nWhen he comes back, he sees Derm casually looking over the woman's magazines on the coffee table. Derm picks up a filled-in New York Times Sunday Crossword and looks it over. \nDERM \nYour wife did this? \nED \nYes. \nDERM \nSmart woman.  The acrostic, too. \nEd hands Derm the water. \nED \nCertainly. \nEd heads into - \nINT. EVE'S ROOM \n- and picks up the small address book from the desk. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nHe hands the address book and takes a picture of Eve from his desk, removing from the frame. \nDERM \nGreat. \nDerm flips through the address book and a business card falls out.  Derm picks it up and looks it over. \nDERM \nGeorge Simian.  Is that the same George that called? \nED \nYes. \nDERM \nThis address, this George Simian lives on Capitol Hill, where we found your wife's car. \nED \nReally? \nDERM \nMay I borrow this? \nED \nI suppose. \nDERM \nI'll call the numbers in here and see what I can turn up.  Try no to worry, Mr Saxon.  I'll be in touch. \nED \nYes, thank you. \nDerm leaves.  Ed shuts the door and locks it. \nThe phone rings and Ed picks it up. \nED \nHello. \nSADIE \n(over phone) \nHe, Mr Saxon? \nED \nYes? \nSADIE \nHi, it's Sadie Crumb, from your creative writing class. \nED \nOh, yes.  Hi. \nSADIE \nAre you OK?  Is this a bad time to call? \nED \nNo.  It's alright. \nSADIE \nI was, I don't know, wondering if you were sick or something, when you didn't come to class. \nED \nNo, well, a little. \nSADIE \nDo you need anything?  I mean, I could bring you something. \nED \nNo, I don't think so. \nSADIE \nReally, it's no problem.  Have you eaten? \nED \nNo, but... \nSADIE \nI can bring you something to eat.  It's no problem.  Some soup or something. \nED \nReally, I don't know if it's a good idea. \nSADIE \nOh, I'm sorry. \nSADIE \nIt's almost eight. \nED \nOh.  I seem to be having a little trouble with time. \nSADIE \nI know what you mean.  I'm one of those people who is always late. \nED \nCome in. \nSADIE \nI hope you don't mind me coming over like this. It didn't occur to me that it might be a little strange until after I hung up. It's just, well, at my high school, I went to boarding school, and we were pretty close with our teachers. \nED \nIt's nice.  Kindness.  Very refreshing. \nSADIE \nI brought you some soup. \nED \nI better get some clothes on.  Make yourself at home. \nSADIE \nOK. \nINT. BEDROOM \nEd gets dressed. As he does, he notices a pile of Eve's clothes on the floor. He picks them up and puts them in the closet, on top of a pile of Eve's dirty laundry. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nWhen Ed comes out, Sadie has put the soup in a bowl and set a place at the table. \nSADIE \nI put it in a bowl for you.  I hope you don't mind. \nED \nThank you. \nEd sits down and tastes the soup. \nED \nIt's good. \nSADIE \nI got it at my favorite place.  You don't mind me hanging out for a little while, do you? \nED \nNo.  I could use the company.  Like I said, I haven't been feeling very well. \nSadie notices the pile of papers on Ed's desk. \nSADIE \nOh, you graded our papers. \nED \nSome of them. \nSADIE \nCan I look? \nED \nSure. \nSadie looks through the papers.  She finds hers marked with a C minus. \nSADIE \nOh. \nED \nWhat is it? \nSADIE \nI just...I guess I though this one was better. \nED \nLet me see. \nEd looks over the paper for a second.  He takes a pen and crosses out the C and changes it to an A. \nED \nI was in a bad mood when I graded these. \nSADIE \nDon't change it if it's not good. \nED \nIt's just a grade. \nSADIE \nPlease don't.  No.  Don't.  Please. \nSadie takes the paper away from him. \nED \nMaybe it's because you were fucking her. \nGEORGE \nYou son of a bitch.  What did you do?  If you hurt her, I swear, I'm going to kill you. \nED \nLook, she disappeared.  I haven't seen her.  Why do you think I called the police? \nGEORGE \nI'll kill you.  I'll kill you, you bastard.  I swear. \nEd hangs up. He is shaky, but also strangely exhilarated. He turns off the ringer on the phone and turns down the volume on the answering machine. \nINT. KITCHEN \nHe brings the rest of the soup to the sink, scrapes it into the garbage disposal, and flicks the switch. When the food has gone down, he starts to wash the dishes. He stops and looks back to the bathroom. \nINT. HALLWAY \nEd walks over to the bathroom door. \nED \nSadie? \nThere is no answer.  He knocks on the door. \nED \nSadie?  Is everything alright? \nThere is still no answer. \nED \nI'm coming in.  OK? \nINT. BATHROOM \nEd opens the door. Sadie is lying on the floor, passed out. Her pants are around her knees, as if she passed out while standing up from the toilet. \nHer nose is bleeding, like she might have hit it on the way down.  It has bled on her sweater. \nThe air from the open door wakes her up, but she is in a heavy daze. \nED \nAre you alright?  My God.  What happened? \nEd comes over to her and lifts her head.  She stares at him strangely. \nED \nCan you stand?  Do you understand me?  I'll help you to the bedroom. \nSadie notices her pants are down. \nSADIE \nOh. \nED \nI'll wait outside. \nINT. HALLWAY \nEd waits outside and, a second later, Sadie comes out, still reeling, clutching her purse. She leans on Ed, who leads her into the bedroom. \nINT. BEDROOM \nSadie lies down on the bed. \nED \nYou want some water. \nSADIE \nYes, please. \nEd goes into the - \nINT. KITCHEN \nHe takes a glass from the cupboard and fills it up. He stops, having noticed something on the glass. He holds the glass up to the light. \nEve's lipstick is clearly marked on the rim. \nHe puts that glass down and fills another. \nINT. BEDROOM \nWhen he comes back, he finds Sadie digging through her purse.  She pulls out an asthma inhaler and takes a couple of big hits. \nThen she sits on the bed and drinks a little water. \nSADIE \nI'm so embarrassed. \nED \nNo, don't be. \nSADIE \nGod, my nose. \nED \nDoes it hurt? \nSADIE \nNo, but the blood. \nCancer.  It was quite an ordeal.  She died very slowly. \nSADIE \nThat's so sad.  I better go, huh? \nED \nIt's getting late. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nEd walks her to the door. \nSADIE \nI'm sorry about everything. \nED \nDon't be sorry.  I'm glad you came. \nSADIE \nI'll see you tomorrow. \nED \nTomorrow? \nSADIE \nIn school.  You'll be there, right? \nED \nOh, yes.  I'll be there. \nSADIE \nBye. \nSadie kisses him on the cheek and then leaves. \nEd locks the door after her. \nINT. BATHROOM \nEd looks at the tub in the bathroom which is full of water. \nHe sticks his finger deep into the drain, trying to free whatever is in there. There is another tuft of hair, and again he throws it into the toilet. \nThe gurgling sound that he heard before has come back, resonating through the soapy water from the drain. \nINT. BASEMENT \nEd follows the gurgling sounds into the basement. \nHe takes a flashlight from behind the basement door and shines it at the pipes that lead from the bathtub drain. He can hear the gurgling sound running through them. It sound like they ate something they can't digest. He reaches up and touches the pipe. It seems to be leaking a little, or maybe it is condensation. \nEd traces the noise to a larger sewage pipe that runs down into the basement floor. He watches the pipe, but slowly, his attention is drawn to the shadow next to the pipe. \nAs he stares intently into the darkness of the shadow, a figure begins to emerge in the distance. The darkness begins to change into a long hallway. A small figure is walking towards Ed and his footsteps echo in the distance. \nEd watches, mesmerized. \nThe basement fades into the blackness, and now, the hallway becomes more clear. \nINT. HOSPITAL \nIt is a very long hospital hallway, and the figure walking toward Ed is a doctor, carrying a clipboard. \nDOCTOR \nMr Saxon. \nED \nYes. \nDOCTOR \nThere's nothing we can do for her now except to alleviate any pain she may be feeling. We have her on a morphine drip and we'll keep increasing the dosage as she shows any signs of pain. \nED \nI see.  Can she understand me? \nDOCTOR \nAt this point, probably not. She has so much morphine in her, I doubt she can even recognize you. But you never know. Actually, in cases like this, where the end is inevitable, I recommend that we increase the dosage on the morphine drip at an accelerated rate. There's no point in making this last longer than it has to. \nED \nWhatever you think is best. \nThe doctor nods, then walks into the hospital room where, we see now, Ed's MOTHER is lying in a hospital bed, hooked up to a digital IV. She is old, but looks older - she's been through chemotherapy and radiation and they have all taken their toll. \nShe stares at Ed with confused and desperate eyes.  It is hard to tell if she is looking at him or not. \nThe doctor, at the door, has a few words with the NURSE, who then looks into the room. \nEd sits next to his mother and takes her hand.  She stares at him. \nThe nurse comes in and pushes a button on the digital IV. Ed watches the LED numbers on the digital IV go up. The nurse smiles an attempt at comfort, then leaves the room. \nMother reacts to the higher dosage of morphine. Her eyes get wider and more delirious. She sits up a little and tenses her muscles. She lets go of Ed's hand and starts moving her arm up and down. \nShe starts shouting something.  At first, it is completely unintelligible, but slowly, it becomes clearer. \nMOTHER \nIT MEANS YOU'RE GOING TO HELL! IT MEANS YOU'RE GOING TO HELL! IT MEANS YOU'RE GOING TO HELL! \nEd stands up and backs away.  He backs out of the hospital room as his mother continues to scream. \nEd backs into the hallway, which is now blackness. \nAs he backs away, another noise starts to echo around him.  A banging.  A loud banging is coming from upstairs. \nEd backs away and then runs upstairs. \nThe P.E. teacher.  I guess I should have known. \nDERM \nApparently your wife has been seeing him for some time.  Almost a year, in fact. \nED \nA year? \nDERM \nDo you consider that you and your wife have a normal relationship? \nED \nI don't know. Normal relationship. We get on each other's nerves, have sex a few times a year, order pizza on Fridays. We've been married for ten years. It doesn't stay rosy forever. Maybe it isn't paradise, but that doesn't mean that I don't love her. \nDERM \nAre you having any other relationships? \nED \nNo. \nDERM \nDoes your wife keep a diary? \nED \nNo.  She isn't the type. \nDERM \nMr Saxon.  May I be frank? \nED \nYes.  Please. \nDERM \nCases involving missing persons are not uncommon. In many cases, and that is not to say in every case, but in many cases, the results are unfortunate. \nED \nMy God. \nDERM \nI'm not saying that you should give up hope, but my experience tells me that you should prepare yourself for the worst. Now, having said that, we will do everything in our power to find your wife. \nED \nI understand. \nDERM \nNow, it's best if we can gather as much information as possible, as quickly as possible. I'm sure you understand the urgency here. \nED \nOf course. \nDERM \nIt will be necessary for us to search through some of your wife's personal items. \nED \nI'm sure I can find whatever it is that you want. \nDERM \nIt's really in your wife's best interests if you allow us to do it. We won't disturb anything or touch anything without your permission. \nED \nAlright. \nDERM \nHow about we start in the bedroom? \nED \nThe bedroom. \nDERM \nYes. \nED \nRight.  I'll show you. \nEd stands up and leads them into the bedroom. \nINT. HALLWAY \nThey pass by the bathroom. The gurgling noises from the plumbing echo around the hallway, and while the police don't seem to pay it any mind, Ed can definitely hear it. \nINT. BEDROOM \nEd looks around the bedroom quickly before they go in. \nED \nHere you go.  It's sort of a mess. \nDERM \nDo you know where your wife keeps her credit card receipts? \nED \nYes.  Sure.  This way. \nEd leads Derm to Eve's room, leaving the two assistants in the bedroom. \nI don't know. \nDERM \nWhat was her name? \nED \nSadie.  Sadie Crumb. \nDerm finds a small, printed name-tag reading Sadie Crumb sewn into the collar. Derm shows it to Mazurek and then indicates for him to go back to the bedroom. \nDerm shows the label to Ed. \nDERM \nDo you have this girl's phone number?  I'd like to talk to her. \nED \nI don't think so.  Maybe. \nEd gets up and walks into the - \nINT. LIVING ROOM \n- where his desk is.  He searches around and quickly finds a photocopy of a hand-written list of phone numbers. \nDERM \nI should call her. \nED \nSure.  Here. \nHe hands him the phone.  Derm dials the number. \nED \nI didn't tell her about my wife.  I didn't see any reason to. \nDerm reaches into his pocket and pulls out a roll of Tums. He takes a couple and chews them and it obviously puts a bad taste in his mouth. \nDERM \nCould I trouble you for a glass of water? \nED \nSure. \nEd walks into the - \nINT. HALLWAY \nHe passes by the bathroom and stops by the bedroom door. He looks into the bedroom where the officers are searching through his stuff. They find a copy of Hustler Magazine and they chuckle about it, before they notice Ed watching them. \nAs he watches, he can hear Derm talking to Sadie. \nDERM \n(O.S.) \nHi. May I speak to Sadie Crumb, please? This is Detective Derm of the Seattle Police Department. Can I ask you a few questions? \nThe officers turn and stare at Ed until he leaves. \nINT. KITCHEN \nEd takes a glass from the cupboard. He takes it over to the sink and fills it with water. The tap makes enough noise so that he can't hear anything else. \nINT. HALLWAY \nAs Ed passes the bathroom door, the gurgling noises from the plumbing get louder. He makes sure the door is firmly shot and then brings the glass of water to Derm. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nDerm hangs up the phone and drinks the water. \nDERM \nThank you. \nED \nWell? \nDERM \nShe sounded very nice.  You know, I think she left her sweater under your bed on purpose. \nED \nWhy would she do that? \nDERM \nSo that she'd have a reason to come back. \nED \nI see. \nDerm sees an open box of Skin-EE( cookies. \nDERM \nHey.  My wife loves those things.  I swear, she eats them by the box.  I think they taste like shit. \nED \nI know.  I hate them.  Sometimes I think she eats them just to spite me. \nMAZUREK \nDetective Derm. \nDerm looks at Ed, then goes into the other room.  Ed follows. \nINT. HALLWAY \nDERM \nIn cases like this, when we don't have many substantial leads, getting a picture of your wife on TV can be invaluably helpful. \nED \nI don't know if I'm comfortable with that. \nDERM \nWe still have options left, but without a thorough search of your wife's belongings, those options are extremely limited. \nED \nI want to be helpful, but I really don't see how, if you think she was kidnapped, I don't see how it helps you to search around our things. \nDERM \nWe don't know that she was kidnapped. We can't draw those kinds of conclusions. She could have simply decided that she needed some time alone. We have to consider every possibility. \nED \nI just don't see how it helps. \nDERM \nI don't want to argue with you.  We're trying to help you.  This is our job. \nED \nI understand. \nDERM \nIt is in the best interest of your wife that you let us do that job without impediment. \nED \nI don't want to get in the way. I just would like some time alone. You can comes back tomorrow, but, please. I'm very tired. I know it might seem irrational, but I haven't slept in a long time and this is all extremely overwhelming. Please. I need to be alone. \nDERM \nCertainly.  If I could just take those receipts. \nED \nSure.  Here.  Take them all. \nThe receipts are on the desk in front of him and he hands them to Derm. \nDerm reaches out for the diary. \nED \nI'd like to keep this. \nDERM \nThere are some things it may be better not to know, especially if your wife comes back. \nED \nI can give it to you tomorrow, if you still want it. \nEd leaves the diary on Eve's writing table and walks the officers out. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nDERM \nMr Saxon.  Is there something wrong with your answering machine? \nED \nYes.  It broke when I fell on it. \nDERM \nYou haven't been answering your phone. \nED \nIt hasn't rung. \nDerm looks at the phone and sees the ringer is turned off. \nDERM \nThe ringer is off. \nED \nOh.  I must have turned it off. \nDERM \nWhat if your wife calls? \nDERM \nYes.  Of course.  I wasn't thinking. \nDERM \nCould you please leave the phone on from now on? \nED \nYes.  I thought I was.  OK.  Thank you. \nDERM \nI'll be calling to let you know how things go with Mr Simian. \nED \nYes.  Thank you. \nDerm and the officers leave. \nEd lets out a sigh of relief.  He touches his forehead and it obviously hurts. \nMRS MASTRIONI \nDoes this mean that you won't be coming to class tomorrow? \nED \nFuck you! \nEd slams the phone down. \nINT. BATHROOM \nEd takes the bottle of Midol from the medicine cabinet and takes a few more. \nThen he notices a trail of pink water leading from the toilet, along the bathroom floor and into the hallway. \nHe follows the trail. \nINT. HALLWAY \nThe trail leads up to the pinkie finger. Ed watches while the finger moves, inchworm-like, across the floor, toward Eve's room, leaving a wet trail behind it. \nEd watches for a second while he decides what to do. \nHe quickly grabs the finger and takes it to the kitchen sink. He drops it in the sink, pushes it down the drain and flicks the garbage disposal on. He turns the water on and leaves it running until it sounds like there is nothing left of the finger. \nWhen he turns it off, he sticks his hand in, searching for any remnants of the finger.  It appears to have gone down. \nHe takes the sponge and wets it. \nINT. HALLWAY \nHe wipes up the trail of the finger, following it back into the bathroom. \nINT. BATHROOM \nHe looks at the toilet, which is still stuffed up. \nINT. BASEMENT \nEd searches around the basement for a plunger.  The basement is full of strange sounds, all ruminating from the exposed pipes. \nHe finds a plunger among some other tools and starts back upstairs, but on his way upstairs, he finds that there is a puddle of water on the floor. He traces the source of the puddle to the pipe that was only moist before. It is now dripping slowly and a large pool of dirty water is collecting in the shallow recess of the cement floor. \nEd stares into the murky, black pool. \nThere is a knock on the door upstairs and Ed turns to answer it. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nEd answers the door and sees that it is now dark outside. \nGEOFFREY COSTAS stands outside. Geoffrey, 54, is a wise, patient man. He is formal and calm in his manner, but these qualities belie a warm emotional vulnerability. Physically, he is not small or weak. One gets the impression that he wasn't always so kind. \nGEOFFREY \nMr Saxon? \nED \nYes. \nGEOFFREY \nHello.  My name is Geoffrey Costas.  I'm from Human Support Services. \nED \nI'm not interested. \nGEOFFREY \nDetective Derm asked me to stop by. \nHe hands him a business card.  Ed takes the card and looks it over. \nGEOFFREY \nYou've been hit. \nED \nI'm fine.  I don't need a doctor. \nHe tries to hand the card back. \nGEOFFREY \nOh, I'm not a physician.  I'm a psychiatrist.  But I'm not here on business.  This is my time off. \nED \nThis is a personal visit?  I don't understand. \nGEOFFREY \nHuman Services is a volunteer organization.  We offer assistance to victims of traumatic crimes. \nED \nWhat kind of assistance? \nGEOFFREY \nAdvice, support, a shoulder to cry on. \nED \nWhy would I want to cry on your shoulder? \nGEOFFREY \nMaybe you just want someone to talk to.  It can be a lonely world when those you love are taken from you. \nED \nNo.  I don't think so. \nGEOFFREY \nWell, you have my card.  If you feel like talking at another time, please feel free to call. \nFor what it's worth, I understand your position better than you think. Don't shut it all out. Sometimes that fragile connection to the rest of the world is all we have. I sincerely hope things turn out for you. Tomorrow then? \nED \nTomorrow. \nEd shuts the door behind Geoffrey. \nINT. BATHROOM \nEd works the plunger in the toilet. The water is still pink from the finger, but also might be pink from the pink toilet paper that is now broken up and mixed in with the water. \nHe plunges the toilet a few more times and then stops to see if it is working. The water slowly goes down. He reaches behind the toilet and turns the water back on. He flushes it and it seems to be working again, albeit weakly. \nHe sits on the edge of the bathtub and takes a breath. The water in the tub hasn't gone down, so he takes the plunger and starts to work it over the drain. \nAfter a minute, he sees that it isn't working. He reaches into the drain and pulls out a huge clump of scum-filled hair. It is repulsive to Ed. He throws it into the toilet. \nThe water in the bathtub still hasn't gone down. \nINT. KITCHEN \nHe searches under the sink through an exhaustive supply of cleaning supplies. He eventually pulls out a king-size container of Drano. \nINT. BATHROOM \nHe reads the back of the container quickly, then pours the whole thing down the drain. \nHe watches it for a second, waiting for it to go down. \nSlowly, then softly, the piano can be heard playing in the other room. \nEd listens to it before following it down the hallway. \nINT. HALLWAY \nThe lamp on Eve's writing desk is on and it lights up the end of the hallway.  The music still seems to be coming from her room. \nINT. EVE'S ROOM \nEd comes in and looks around the room.  There is no one playing the piano, but the music continues over the rest of the scene. \nEd's attention turns to the diary, which is still sitting on the desk where he left it. Ed sits in the chair and starts paging through Eve's diary. The piano continues playing. \nWe hear Eve's voice as it must have been when she was writing. \nEVE \n(V.O.) \nMore than three weeks late. Damn. I'm so stupid. I haven't told George because I'm sure he would use this as an excuse to pressure me to leave Ed. And how can I tell Ed. There's no way he could be the father. We haven't had sex in months. He would know it isn't is. \nEd flips back a few pages. \nAs he does, the camera starts to travel around the room, passing the piano, and then a few pictures from Eve's past, then some souvenirs on a shelf. \nEVE \n(V.O.) \nSaw a movie last night with George. It was awful; just the kind of movie Ed hates. I wanted to tell him about it, but I couldn't. I told him I was at Susie's. George loved it, of course. I think he likes every movie. Still, it was nice to go out on a date like that. It was fun. \nINT. HALLWAY \nNow the camera has turned to the empty hallway.  It slowly moves toward the bathroom. \nEVE \n(V.O.) \nEd came home in a shitty mood and started picking a fight with me about a coffee cup I broke last week. It was the last thing I needed, today especially. Sometimes I fucking hate him. He can be such a shit. \nINT. KITCHEN \nThe camera pans over the glass that has Eve's lipstick on it. \nEVE \n(V.O.) \nI can't believe what a jock George is. I knew he worked out, but he really takes car of himself. After we had sex, I was embarrassed to let him see me naked. How could I have gotten so fat? I'm going back to the gym tomorrow. I've really let myself go to pot. Maybe I'll get him a softball bat for his birthday next week. \nINT. BATHROOM \nThe camera comes into the bathroom and passes over all of Eve's things sitting on the back of the toilet. \nEVE \n(V.O.) \nEd doesn't sleep anymore. He's beginning to scare me. He takes all these pills to help him sleep, but they only make it worse. And he hates me. I can see it in his eyes. He blames me for everything that went wrong in his life. Maybe he's right. Maybe it is my fault. I feel so guilty about George that I can't argue with him anymore. I can't keep this up much longer. Fuck it. I'm going to tell him about George tomorrow. He knows anyway. He must know. He's been acting so weird. Poor Ed. He used to have so much ambition. And he's so talented. I just wish things had turned out better. \nThe camera turns toward the bathtub, and focuses slowly in on the drain. A few bubbles pop out from under the water and the water starts to drain out. As the camera dollies in on the drain, the last of the murky water disappears. \nEd, now standing in the bathroom, strikes a match and holds it up to the diary until the corner finally catches on fire. He fans out the pages so that it will catch more. \nWhen he can't hold it anymore, he drops it into the bathtub and watches it burn. He watches it until it has burnt itself out, burning into a pile of thick, black ashes. \nINT. HALLWAY \nEd looks up at the smoke alarm.  He tries to pull it down, but it is out of his reach. \nEd grabs a chair from the living room and stands on it so that he can reach the alarm. He pulls the cover off the alarm and then the battery out and the alarm is finally silenced. \nThen he hears voices coming from outside the front door. \nHe approaches the front door cautiously, then puts his ear up to the door and listens. The voices are muted and whispered, but Ed can still hear what is being said, although it is hard to tell who is talking. \nHARVEY \n(O.S.) \nNo.  I won't. \nSADIE \n(O.S.) \nYou are so crazy. \nHARVEY \nED \nSomebody hit me. \nSADIE \nAre you alright? \nED \nI'm fine. \nSADIE \nWho hit you? \nED \nI really don't want to get into it. \nSADIE \nI nearly had a heart attack when the police called me. \nED \nWhat did they ask you? \nSADIE \nJust about me being here.  About what happened. \nED \nBut nothing happened. \nSADIE \nThat's what I told them. \nED \nThey found your sweater.  It has blood all over it. \nSADIE \nYou're kidding. \nED \nYou left it under the bed. \nSADIE \nOh, yeah.  Damn.  I don't know why I do things like that. \nED \nWhat if my wife had found it? \nSADIE \nOh.  Is she here? \nED \nNo.  Look, Sadie.  I don't want you to get the wrong idea. \nSADIE \nDon't be mad. It's just that I worry too much. You didn't come to class again. And you said you would. I started getting all these ideas. I called you, but nobody answered. I meant to bring your wife's sweater back, but I forgot it. \nED \nActually, I'm glad you're here.  Can you do me a favor? \nSADIE \nSure.  Anything. \nED \nI have to get a prescription filled. \nSADIE \nNo problem. \nEd finds the prescription on his desk. \nED \nI'd go myself, but I'm expecting a phone call. \nSADIE \nSure. \nHe hands her the prescription. \nED \nThere's a twenty-four pharmacy on Market. \nSADIE \nI know the one.  I go there all the time.  It's like my second home. \nED \nI'll give you my credit card. \nEd finds his wallet and hands her the card. \nSADIE \nI'll be back in a minute. \nED \nThank you. \nED \nYou put it all on my credit card, right? \nSADIE \nActually, I paid for it.  They wouldn't take your card. \nED \nWhy not? \nSADIE \nThey said you hadn't paid your bill, on the phone.  They called the credit card people when it didn't go through. \nED \nDamn.  Well, I'll pay you back. \nSADIE \nIt's OK.  I charged it to my Dad.  I don't even pay the bill. \nED \nNo, those pills are expensive.  And my insurance will cover it anyway. \nSADIE \nPay me back later, then.  Really, it's OK. \nED \nAre you sure? \nSADIE \nIt's fine.  I swear. \nSadie looks at the cuts on his face. \nSADIE \nYour face must hurt. \nED \nNo.  I don't seem to feel anything. \nSADIE \nIt's nasty. \nSadie takes a closer look. \nSADIE \nHere.  Sit down. \nShe sits Ed down at the kitchen table, under a light, and sits across from him, then takes the peroxide and some cotton swabs she bought at the pharmacy and starts to dress his wounds. \nED \nI've never been hit before. \nSADIE \nMe neither. \nED \nIt's not so bad, really. It's humbling, but I like the effect it seems to have on people. It seems to make them more compassionate. There's a competitive market for suffering in the world. It's difficult to stand out from the handicapped and the homeless and the politically oppressed. Sometimes a little advertising helps remind people that you're a human being. \nSADIE \nIt does make you look sort of cute, in a pathetic kind of way. \nED \nSadie. \nSADIE \nAre you really married? \nED \nWhat?  You think I just made it up? \nSADIE \nI don't know.  Some people just say they're married, you know, because maybe they think it's more respectable or something. \nED \nI'm not one of those people. \nSADIE \nI didn't mean to imply anything.  It's just that you act sort of weird. \nED \nI act weird? \nSADIE \nNot weird, really.  Worried, I guess.  Secretive.  Like you're worried I might find out something about you. \nED \nYou don't want to get involved with my problems. \nSADIE \nMaybe I do. \nED \nBelieve me, you don't. \nYes. \nDERM \nIt's Detective Derm.  I'm sorry to call you so late, but I thought you would want to hear this. \nED \nYes? \nDERM \nI'm afraid I have some bad news. \nED \nWhat is it? \nDERM \nIt's your wife.  We've found her... \nED \nYou found her. \nDERM \nWe found her body. \nED \nHer... \nDERM \nYes, sir.  In the woods, near George Simian's house, where we found her car.  I'm afraid she's dead. \nEd drops the phone.  He walks trance-like into the hallway. \nHe follows the noise into the - \nINT. BATHROOM \nThe noise coming from the bathroom now sounds more human, like a baby gurgling. \nAs Ed walks into the bathroom, he can see that there is something in the bathtub. The shower curtain is closed, but behind it, there is some sort of body moving. Ed pulls the curtain back. He reveals a baby, just born, lying in the tub. Most of the murky water has drained and left a dirty ring around the tub. \nThe BABY is a newborn, except that its eyes are maybe larger than they would be. The Baby is also SIX FEET TALL. It's immense frame fills the bathtub. It is naked (it's a boy). \nEd watches with amazement. The baby looks incredibly real, except for its size. The stare at each other for a minute. The baby looks a lot like George Simian. It has his eyes. \nOther than this, it behaves like a baby. It is lying on its back, gurgling peacefully with his feet in the air and his left hand gripping the shower curtain. \nThe baby reaches out for Ed lovingly. \nEd backs away. \nSeeing this, the baby starts crying. \nEd, panicking, approaches the baby. It is still crying. Ed reaches out to touch it. He touches its arm and the baby's crying starts to subside. The baby moves with typical, quick, chaotic movements that, because of the baby's size, are almost threatening. \nEd puts his hand in the baby's hand. The baby grips it as baby's do, but this baby's hand is about the size of Ed's. The baby stops crying and returns to its curious gurgling. \nEd tries to pull his hand back, but the baby won't let go. The baby, it seems, is incredibly strong. Ed pulls harder. He still can't get the baby to let go. Ed tries to pry the baby's fingers off, and this time manages to get his hand out of the baby's grip. \nBut as soon as he does, the baby starts crying again. \nHe backs out into the hallway. \nINT. HALLWAY \nEd is in a panic.  The baby's cries echo around him as he backs away from the bathroom. \nINT. KITCHEN \nEd finds himself in the kitchen. He looks at his hands which are covered with bloody muck from the tub. He washes them off in the sink. He looks over at the kitchen knife which has been drying in the dish rack. \nINT. HALLWAY \nEd walks slowly, purposefully to the bathroom.  The crying baby gets louder as he approaches. \nINT. BATHROOM \nHe comes into the bathroom, but in the tub, instead of the baby, there is a grown man's body. It is Ed, staring up at himself from under the water. We only see a very tight shot of BATHTUB ED's head and part of his neck. His head is under water and he looks up, unable to move. \nWe then see the reverse shot of this and it is also of Ed, so that Ed is, in effect, looking up at himself through the cloudy water. \nThe baby cries continue, although the baby is no longer in the scene. \nFrom Bathtub Ed's point of view, we see the other Ed takes the kitchen knife and lean forward and to the right, off-camera. \nBathtub Ed, who can move his eyes, tries to look to his arm, where the other Ed is cutting. Soon, blood starts to mix with the water, diffusing over Bathtub Ed's face. \nThe blood also diffuses over Bathtub Ed's P.O.V., as he looks up at the other Ed cutting him. When the other Ed is finished cutting, Bathtub Ed sees him put the knife aside and then reach down, off-camera. After a short struggle, the other Ed pulls up Bathtub Ed's severed arm and slips it into a garbage bag he has already prepared. \nThe blood from Bathtub Ed's cut fills the water with dark blood, turning the film red. \nThe red dissolves into a pool of blood that is in the hallway. \nINT. HALLWAY \nEd, with a bucket and sponge, is cleaning pockets of blood from the floor and walls.  He is crying while he does this. \nHe squeezes the sponge for the last time, then inspects the hallway as closely as he can, searching for any spots he might have missed. \nThen he picks up the bucket and takes it into the bathroom. \nINT. BATHROOM \nHe dumps the water from the bucket into the bathtub. The water is pink and dirty. He sits down on the edge of the bathtub and watches the water go down the drain. \nHe stares at the drain in a trance until he hears a knock on the front door.  He turns to listen to it in the other room. \nINT. HALLWAY - DAY \nAs he opens the bathroom door, he sees that the sun is shining in from the living room. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nGeoffrey stands patiently outside as Ed opens the door. He carries his briefcase and looks dressed for work. His appearance is a stark contrast to the half-dressed, blood-shot Ed. \nWhy would somebody do that? \nGEOFFREY \nSometimes a man, when faced with his own problems or inadequacies, takes it out on someone weaker than themselves. \nED \nI'm sorry. \nGEOFFREY \nDo you feel responsible at all for your wife's disappearance? \nED \nWhy? \nGEOFFREY \nPeople often blame themselves for events that they have no control over, especially when the events seem so random and cruel. Action leading up to tragedy tend to become more significant. Details weigh on the conscience. \nED \nI do seem to be having problems with my conscience. \nGEOFFREY \nI see. \nED \nDo you think that's why I can't sleep? \nGEOFFREY \nCould be. \nED \nIs there anything you can give me? \nGEOFFREY \nA prescription?  For your conscience?  Of course not. \nED \nThen what's the point? \nGEOFFREY \nThere are other ways I can be of help. \nED \nA shoulder to cry on? \nGEOFFREY \nWould you like me to call the police?  There might be some news. \nED \nThe police called last night, late last night.  They found Eve's body. \nGEOFFREY \nOh, no. \nED \nThey found her buried in the woods, near where they found her car. \nGEOFFREY \nI'm sorry.  I didn't know. \nGeoffrey's watch alarm goes off. He looks at the time and then, habitually takes a shiny silver pillbox from his pocket. He takes two pills out. \nGEOFFREY \nExcuse me. \nED \nI never knew I could feel so alone. \nGeoffrey takes a thermos from his briefcase, pours some hot tea into the lid and swallows the pills with a mouthful of tea. \nGEOFFREY \nHe hasn't called since last night? \nED \nNo. \nGEOFFREY \nIt's been a while.  Why don't you let me call him?  Maybe there's some news. \nWhen Ed doesn't object, Geoffrey takes his address book from his briefcase, along with a cellular phone and dials the number. \nGEOFFREY \nDetective Derm, please. Hi, Charlie, it's Geoffrey. I'm over at Ed Saxon's house. Yeah. He was hoping to get some information on his wife. Uh-huh. Well, he said you called him last night and told him that you had found her body. Uh-huh. I see. In the woods, near where you found her car. I don't know. Yes. Well, I did give him something to help him sleep. Right. Yes. \nThen Geoffrey turns away from Ed and says a few words quietly, so that Ed can't hear.  Then... \nGEOFFREY \nYes.  Yes.  I'll tell him.  Yes.  OK.  Bye. \nGeoffrey hangs up and turns back to Ed. \nED \nWhat? \nGEOFFREY \n", "test1_input": "ED \nYes. \nDERM \nI've been trying to call you. \nED \nYou found her. \nDERM \nNo.  I need to talk to you. \nED \nDetective.  George Simian was just over here.  He hit me. \nDERM \nAre you OK? \nED \nI think so. \nDERM \nDo you want me to call an ambulance? \nED \nI don't need an ambulance. \nDERM \nI'll be right over. \nED \nOK. \nHe hangs up the phone. \nHe sits at the desk, resting the ice on his forehead. \nThen he notices something under the sofa.  It grabs his attention.  He gets up for a closer look. \nThere are dust bunnies and dust under the edge of the sofa, like it hasn't been swept for a while. Ed kneels down and tries to peer under the sofa. It is dark underneath and he can't see anything. \nHe reaches his fingers under and sweeps out a few dust bunnies. \nThen he reaches a little further under the sofa and sweeps out Eve's pinkie finger. \nHe recoils at the sight of this. The finger has been neatly cut, as if by a sharp blade. Dust has clung to the clotted blood around the stump, but it is unquestionably a woman's pinkie finger. \nHe stares at it for a second, curiously disgusted. \nHe goes to pick it up, decides he doesn't want to touch it, then uses a tissue to pick it up. \nHe hurries to the bathroom. \nINT. BATHROOM \nHe drops the finger into the toilet with the tissue and flushes it. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nHe hurries to the edge of the couch with a sponge and cleans up the small amount of blood and dust left there. \nINT. KITCHEN \nHe squeezes the sponge out until it is clean, then puts it aside. \nHe lets out a huge sigh of relief. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nMuch of the ice has melted and the towel it was wrapped in is now soaking wet. \nINT. BATHROOM \nHe takes the towel into the bathroom and rings it out. \nThen he looks over at the toilet. The finger is still there, floating like a cigarette butt. The water is pink from the blood, the tissue is gone, but the finger floats there defiantly. \nHe flushes the toilet again, but this time stays to watch.  The water goes down, but the finger stays buoyant and won't go down. \nThere is a knock on the front door. \nEd takes a bunch of toilet paper from the roll and tosses it over the finger. He flushes again, but the tank hasn't filled up yet and, if anything, this makes it longer until it will fill up again. \nThere is another impatient knock at the door. \nED \nOne second! \nEd sits there waiting, listening to the toilet tank filling. \nThe knocking outside is becoming more impatient. \nThe tank finally fills. Ed flushes and watches. This time the paper he threw in clogs the toilet and the bowl quickly fills up with water. \nEd reaches behind the toilet and turns off the water, stopping it from overflowing. \nHe looks in the toilet and can't see the finger through the mess of toilet paper. \nThere is another knock on the door. \nEd closes the toilet lid. \nINT. HALLWAY \nEd shuts the bathroom door firmly, takes a breath, and hurries out to meet Derm. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nEd answers the door.  Derm comes in with two assistants, MAZUREK and SNYDER.  Snyder is holding Ed's morning paper. \n", "test1_true": "Damn.  You did take a couple of blows, didn't you. \nED \nI was just putting some ice on it. \nDERM \nThat's the best thing for it. Try to keep the swelling down. It's going to look worse tomorrow. You don't want to have a doctor examine you? \nED \nIt's not necessary. \nDERM \nMr Saxon, Officer Mazurek and Officer Snyder.  They'll be assisting me. \nED \nHi. \nMAZUREK \nHow's it going? \nSNYDER \nHere.  I brought this in. \nSnyder hands Ed the newspaper. \nED \nThanks. \nDERM \nYou say it was George Simian who hit you? \nED \nYes, he did.  He came barreling in here and hit me.  Several times. \nDERM \nDo you have any idea why he would come here? \nED \nBecause he's a fucking asshole. \nDERM \nI should say that I'm concerned that he would come here. Mr Simian has a history of violent behavior, in regards to domestic disputes. \nED \nWhat kind of history? \nDERM \nNothing too serious. No felonies. But enough, I think, to warrant some concern. With your permission, I'd like to fill in a complaint report for his assault on you, and as soon as we're finished here, I'll send these two over to arrest him, assuming he can be found. \nED \nYou think he did something to Eve? \nDERM \nWe don't have any evidence that he's even seen your wife she left her office and disappeared. We'll be arresting him solely for his assault on you. \nED \nBut Eve's car.  You said you found her car near his house. \nDERM \nIt does no one any good to jump to conclusions. \nED \nI guess I misunderstood. \nDERM \nWe're going to have to take some pictures of you for the complaint report. The pictures will be used as evidence against Mr Simian if this matter does, eventually, go to trial. \nED \nFine. \nDerm turns to Snyder, who has heard this conversation, and Snyder begins to take pictures of Ed. \nDERM \nMr Saxon. These investigations can be quite demanding, especially when experiencing the trauma of loss. Do you understand what I am saying? \nED \nYes. \nDERM \nIf you feel that you need someone to talk to, at any time, there are people, sometimes victims of similar situation themselves, who are will to listen and would like to help. \nHe hands Ed a business card which reads Human Support Services, and has some address and phone information on it. \nDERM \nAre you aware that your wife has been having an affair? \nED \nWith George Simian? \nDERM \nYes. \nED \n", "test2_input": "ED \nOf course I'm worried. I'm just working right now. This girl is one of my students. She wanted some help on an assignment. She doesn't know anything about Eve being missing. \nSUSIE \nWhat happened to you? \nED \nGeorge Simian hit me. \nSUSIE \nGeorge? \nED \nYou know him.  It figures. 1tt1Susie starts crying.  Ed stares at her helplessly, then goes back inside. \nSUSIE \nWait. 1tt1Ed stops. \nSUSIE \nCan I come back later? \nED \nIt's late.  I just took some sleeping pills.  I haven't slept much since this all started.  Why don't you come back tomorrow? \nSUSIE \nTomorrow? \nED \nGood night, Susie. \nEd walks back in, leaving Susie standing on the porch. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nEd waits by the door until he hears her footsteps walking away outside. \nSadie stands up, looking nervous. \nSADIE 2t2Is that your wife? \nED 2t2No.  It was a friend of hers. \nSADIE 2t2I should go. \nED 2t2No.  Why? \nSADIE 2t2You must be tired.  Those pills must be working. \nED 2t2I don't think they're working at all. \nSADIE 2t2Still.  You're married, right? \nED 2t2Yeah, but, please don't go.  Please.  Time has a way of slowing down when you're around. \nSADIE 2t2Really?  For me, too. \nED 2t2So you'll stay? \nSADIE 2t2If you want me to. \nEd comes over to her and kisses her. \nSADIE 2t2Can I ask you something? \nED 2t2What? \nSADIE 2t2Do you think my writing is good? \nED 2t2You've done some good work. \nSADIE 2t2Yeah.  C minus good. \nED 2t2I told you, I was in a bad mood when I graded that. \nSADIE 2t2I guess so. \nShe is unresponsive at first. \nSADIE \n(to herself) 2t2What am I doing? \nThey kiss for a minute, then Ed slips his hand under the back of Sadie's sweater. \nShe kisses him again. \nINT. BEDROOM \nSadie turns the lights off and we can only see by the light coming in from the hallway. \nEd lies on the bed and Sadie lies next to him, under the covers. Ed slips his hand under the back of her sweater and fiddles with her bra while they kiss. \nThe gurgling sound starts up again, and while Sadie doesn't notice, or doesn't hear it, it becomes increasingly distracting to Ed. He looks to the bathroom where the noise is coming from. \nINT. BATHROOM \nThe camera focuses in on the drain.  The water in the bathtub starts rising again. \nINT. BEDROOM \nSadie breaks away from him, sits up and takes off her sweater.  Ed takes off his shirt. \nEd's kisses move around the side of her neck. As he reaches her ear, he looks up and notices Eve's clothes sitting on the chair. \nINT. BATHROOM \nThe water is rising slowly, but we can see solid stuff (the ashes from the diary are clearly part of the muck) seeping out of the drain with the water. It is a cloudy, dark, disgusting water which probably stinks too. \nINT. BEDROOM \nEd is trying to concentrate on Sadie, but he notices the closet door is open and there are some dresses blowing around inside. \n", "test2_true": "He turns Sadie onto her back, turning himself away from the closet. His kisses run down her chest until he gets to her jeans. He unbuttons her jeans and starts to pull them off, kissing as he goes. \nEd has taken her pants off, but his passion and enthusiasm has faded, and he stops and stares off into space, towards the bathroom. He is spooked. \nSADIE 2t2What's wrong? \nHe looks down and sees Sadie staring at him. \nED 2t2I don't know.  Maybe it's those pills.  I don't know. \nSADIE 2t2Just relax.  Lie back. \nSadie gently pushes him back and starts to go down on him. \nEd get more uptight. \nED 2t2No.  Please.  Just stop. \nShe keeps trying until Ed is forced to push her away. \nED 2t2It's just not working.  OK? \nSADIE 2t2Alright.  I'm sorry. \nSadie turns away.  She's upset. \nSADIE 2t2Maybe I should go. \nED 2t2No.  Please, don't.  It's my fault.  Please.  Don't go. \nSADIE 2t2Damn, I'm so stupid. \nED 2t2No, it's me.  Please. \nSADIE 2t2This was a mistake. \nSadie gets up and puts on her shirt.  She grabs the rest of her clothes and goes into the living room. \nEd stares after her, listening to her finish dressing herself and then leave. \nThe clock next to the bed is ticking loudly and the sound of the ticking continues of the next few scenes, as indicated. \nINT. KITCHEN \nEd pours a few more pills into his hand, swallowing them with some wine from the bottle. \nINT. BATHROOM \nEd looks at the bathtub, which is full of the murky water. He picks up the plunger, which is still by the toilet, and starts working it on the drain. \nMore stuff is coming up, making the water darker, but as he relaxes the plunger, the water doesn't go down. If anything, the gurgling sound is louder. \nHe works the plunger some more, more vigorously and then, again, relaxes it and watches the drain hopefully. The gurgling noise seems closer and the water still does not go down. \nThen he hears something hit the front door. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nEd opens the front door and picks up the newspaper which has just been thrown. He puts it with the other newspapers, which have piled up in their plastic wraps on his desk. \nINT. BATHROOM \nHe comes back into the bathroom and looks at the bathtub. \nHe puts the plunger over the drain and works it much harder and, this time, after a few seconds, there is a loud knock in the pipes, as if he hit something. He takes the plunger away and watches the drain. \nSuddenly, a large air bubble bursts out of the drain.  He watches, but the water shows no sign of draining. \nThen, slowly, blood starts to leak into the tub from the drain. \nEd is naturally terrified by this.  He watches until it is clear that it is blood and not just more gook. \nHe puts plunger back on the drain and pumps it a few more frantic times. More blood seeps out of the drain. He seems to be making the problem worse. \nHe shuts the shower curtain and backs out of the bathroom. \nINT. KITCHEN \nHe spills the pills on the kitchen counter and counts them quickly. There are about ten left. He pours them into his mouth and swallows the rest of the wine. \nThen the ticking stops.  Ed looks at a clock on the wall.  The second hand has stopped. \nHe hears voices in the other room. \nINT. EVE'S ROOM \nHe looks out of the window in Eve's room. He sees that the light in the neighbor's window is on. The couple next door are having another argument, but this one is much more intense than the last. \nWOMAN \n(O.S.) 2t2Why do you care! You don't care! You know nothing about me! I hate you! Stay away from me! I'll scream! I am not screaming now! You think you're the only one? Yes, I do! I LOVE YOU! You never do that! You do not! You never do anything! You think that nothing's wrong! You think we live in paradise! This is what I think of this fucking house! \nThere is the sound of things breaking. \nWOMAN \n(O.S.) \nIT'S NOT MY FAULT! IT'S NOT MY FAULT! THEN DON'T! I AM NOT! I LOVE YOU! FUCK YOU! I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU SAID THAT! STAY AWAY FROM ME! YOU RUINED MY LIFE! STAY AWAY FROM ME! STOP IT! SHUT UP! STAY AWAY FROM ME! NO! STOP IT! YOU SON OF A BITCH! HELP! HELP! \nThis ends with a loud, terrifying shriek.  It seems to echo around the room as Ed watches.  Then the voices stop. \nEd watches the window and sees a featureless man stick his head through the curtains to see if anybody is listening. Then he closes the window and curtains. \nThe phone rings in the other room. \nINT. KITCHEN \nHe hurries to answer the phone. \nWhile he is on the phone, a new sound is coming from the bathroom.  It is like the gurgling sound, but also subtly different. \nED \nHello. \nDERM \nMr Saxon? \nED \n", "test3_input": "George. \nGEORGE \nWhat did you do to Eve? \nED \nI didn't do anything. \nGEORGE \nI know you did. I saw her before she left work. We met in the parking lot, like we always did. She told me she was leaving you. She was going to tell you when she got home. \nED \nYou don't know anything about it. \nGEORGE \nYes, I do.  I know you.  Eve talks about you.  She tell me things. \nED \nWhat things? \nGEORGE \nI know about the fights you have. \nED \nShe's my wife.  We fight sometimes. \nGEORGE \nThat's bullshit.  I know what kind of a son of bitch you can be.  She's told me. \nED \nWhat don't you tell it to the police? \nGEORGE \nI did. \nED \nYou think she was some sort of angel?  She was cheating on me. \nGEORGE \nI love her.  I loved her. \nEd listens to George break down. \nED \nI'm sorry. \nThere is a long pause. \nGEORGE \nIt's not enough. \nGeorge hangs up. \nINT. BATHROOM \nThe bathroom is completely clean. There is no sign of any of the activity from before. Ed finds the bottle of prescription sleeping pills. It is empty. He takes a couple of Midol and swallows them dry. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nEd sits down at his desk.  He looks over the papers on his desk.  Sadie's is on top.  He looks it over. \nThe phone rings and he picks it up. \nED \nHello? \nSADIE \nHello. \nED \nSadie. \nSADIE \nI wanted to apologize. \nED \nNo.  Don't apologize.  It was me. \nSADIE \nI shouldn't have left like that.  I don't know what came over me. \nED \nIt was understandable, under the circumstances. \nSADIE \nI really wanted you to like me. \nED \nI wonder if you'll still feel the same way when you find out what kind of person I really am. \nSADIE \nI'll still keep your poem on my wall. \nED \nYes. \n", "test3_true": "I think it's a beautiful poem.  I really do.  Are you still there? \nED \nYes. \nSADIE \nI wish things had turned out better. \nShe hangs up.  Ed stays on the phone, listening until the dial tone clicks back in. \nThen Ed hears a car pull up outside.  He follows some quiet footsteps as they walk up to the front door. \nHe sees the door knob turn quietly in the door.  The door is locked. \nEd approaches the door slowly, but suddenly, there is a crash against it.  Someone is trying to knock the door down. \nThe door is strong, and doesn't open, but the wall around it shakes. \nAfter a few seconds, there is another crash against the door. This time the wall shakes so much that Eve's picture, which hangs by the door, almost falls off its nail. \nEd looks out of the window. The window is positioned facing the street, but not the porch, so he cannot see who it is, but he can see a car parked out front, with the door still open. Inside the car, there is a softball glove lying on the passenger seat, along with something that George Simian was wearing when we last saw him. \nGeorge crashes against the door again. This time Eve's picture falls off the wall. It hits the ground and smashes, spreading broken glass around her picture. \nThe door is starting to loosen around the lock and jamb. \nINT. HALLWAY \nEd backs into the hallway.  As he passes the bathroom, he can hear the gurgling sounds from the plumbing starting up again. \nINT. KITCHEN \nEd backs into the kitchen. He searches around, quickly finding the kitchen knife. He grabs it out of the dish rack and starts walking toward the front door. \nINT. HALLWAY \nThere's another bang on the door.  Ed passes slowly through the hallway, watching the door, holding the knife in front of him. \nThe gurgling sounds in the bathroom are deep and resonant, echoing out of the drain, around the bathroom and into the hallway. \nThere is another hard crash against the door, which breaks the jamb. The door is only being held on by the splinters around the lock and George starts kicking the door with his foot. \nEd backs into the basement door.  He opens it and goes into the- \nINT. BASEMENT \nHe hurries down the stairs into the darkness of the basement. The pipes surround Ed with hysterical, thick, watery sounds. There are metallic creaks and strains which reverberate around the walls of the basement as the pipes seem to expand and contract. \nA couple of inches of dark, dirty water have collected on the floor and Ed's feet get wet as he steps off the last stair. \nEd finds a place to hide in the shadows behind some boxes. He stares up, as he hears the door breaking open upstairs and someone walking into the living room. \nWith his eyes, he follows the footsteps as they search the apartment. \nEd has hidden under a large pipe, which is dripping drops of dirty water onto his face. In the darkness of the basement, the color of the water is unclear, but as he wipes some onto his fingers, he can see it is murky and dark. \nThe basement door opens slowly, and from the light upstairs, Ed can see the silhouette of George Simian standing with a softball bat. \nEd grips onto his knife and watches as George comes down the stairs, step by step. The water keeps dripping on the top of Ed's head, running down the side of his face, but he holds still. \nEd watches George come down the stairs. \nGeorge reaches the bottom and steps into the shallow water.  He peers cautiously into the shadows.  He starts walking toward Ed. \nEd withdraws as much as he can into his corner until he is in complete darkness. \nHe watches George approaching him and he slowly raises his knife. \nGeorge raises his softball bat. He takes a few more steps up to Ed, but then steps blindly past him and into a deep, dark shadow. \nEd watches him disappear into the shadow and then, makes his move. He rushes into the shadow with his knife raised and both he and George are engulfed in darkness. \nAfter a few seconds, Ed emerges from the shadow. He drops the knife into the water at his feet. As he does, blood runs out of the shadow, mixing with the water in the basement floor. \nEd walks slowly upstairs.  The noises around him in the basement are now at their loudest. \nINT. BATHROOM \nEd takes a long look at himself in the mirror. He is wet with blood and dirt. He opens the medicine cabinet and finds the sleeping pills he was using before. He opens the bottle and empties it into his hand. There are only about five pills left. \nHe takes the two toothbrushes from a toothpaste-crusty glass and fills it with water.  He takes the pills. \nUnsatisfied, he searches through the rest of the medicine cabinet. The selection, though not particularly toxic, is a good representation of standard, over-the-counter pills and tonics. He finds the Midol and takes the last few from the bottle. There is a bottle of cold medicine which he finishes off. He drinks down a nearly full bottle of pink diarrhea medicine. He finds a bottle of multi-vitamins and takes a handful of those. As he finishes each one, he drops the empties onto the floor of the bathroom. \nWhen he stops, he notices blood seeping out of the bathtub drain. It is pure, thick, dark blood. He backs away into the hallway. \nINT. HALLWAY \nEd backs into the wall and then, losing strength in his legs, lowers himself to the floor.  He keeps watching the bathtub. \nPiano music starts to seep through the gurgling noises.  Ed turns towards Eve's room. \nOn the other side of the house, outside the broken door, Ed can hear Derm's car pull up. Ed watches the living room as Derm comes in carefully, flanked by Mazurek and Snyder. \nDerm comes over to Ed and kneels down in front of him.  Ed looks up at him helplessly. \nED \nIt wasn't me. \nDerm looks at Ed's hands, which are covered in blood. \nED \nIt wasn't me. \nEd watches Derm looking at him.  Then he notices, behind Derm, blood seeping over the rim of the bathtub. \nEd turns to Eve's room, where the piano can still be heard. \nThe camera continues on where Ed can't go: down the hallway to Eve's room. As it approaches, all the other noises fade out and the piano is all that we hear. \nEd watches from his position in the hall so that it all seems like his point of view. \nINT. EVE'S ROOM \nThe camera comes into Eve's room and turns to the piano. \nEVE is sitting at the piano, playing some music. We watch her for a few seconds. She turns to the camera as she plays, then continues playing. \n"}

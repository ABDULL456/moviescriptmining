{"test1_input": "Hi, this is Detective Derm of the Seattle Police. I was wondering if Mrs Eve Saxon had come into work today, or called in, any word from her. Yes. Since yesterday. Did you see her leave yesterday? Yes. About what time was that? I'm not sure. Is she calls, or comes in, could you please ask her to call me. My number is 734-9722, extension 38. Thank you. Bye. \nHe hangs up. \nDERM \nShe hasn't been in today. \nED \nMy God. \nDERM \nShe hasn't called here at all? \nED \nNo. \nDERM \nAny messages? \nHe points to the answering machine.  It is blinking, full of messages. \nED \nI must have been asleep. \nDERM \nThat happens. \nED \nI was up late last night. \nDERM \nI understand.  Why don't we listen to these messages? \nED \nAlright. \nEd pushes the button on the machine. \nThe first message is from Eve's work. \nCELESTE \n(on machine) \nHi, this is Celeste, calling for Eve. We're worried about you. You don't come in. You don't call. No, seriously, we just want to make sure you're OK. Don't worry about your students. Marie's covering for you. But give us a call, OK? Bye. \nED \nThat's the school where Eve works.  She's a piano teacher at Franklin High. \nThen there's a message for Ed. \nMRS MASTRIONI \n(on machine) \nHello, Mr Saxon. This is Mrs Mastrioni from the University. You didn't show up for your morning class and I'm calling to see if you'll be in for your other classes so that I can make the proper arrangements. I assume you remember how to use the phone. \nED \nDamn. \nDERM \nYou're a teacher too? \nED \nA professor at the University. \nThe next message is Derm. \nDERM \n(on machine) \nHello, this is Detective Derm from the Seattle Police Department... \nDerm takes a small pill box from his overcoat, while the machine plays in the background. \nDERM \nThat's me.  Do you have a glass of water? \nED \nSure. \nEd goes into the - \nINT. KITCHEN \n- and fills a glass for the detective. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nWhen he comes back, he sees Derm casually looking over the woman's magazines on the coffee table. Derm picks up a filled-in New York Times Sunday Crossword and looks it over. \nDERM \nYour wife did this? \nED \nYes. \nDERM \nSmart woman.  The acrostic, too. \nEd hands Derm the water. \n", "test1_true": "Thank you. \nMeanwhile the next message comes on.  It is a girl from Ed's class. \nSADIE \n(on machine) \nHello, Mr Saxon? This is Sadie, from your creative writing class. Anyway, you didn't show up today and I just wanted to see if you were OK and, you know, if there was any reading or anything you wanted us to do. My number is 323-4854. I hope you're alright. Bye. \nDERM \nA student? \nED \nYes. \nDERM \nDo they call you often? \nED \nNo, but they all have my number. \nThe next message is from Susie. \nSUSIE \n(on machine) \nHe, Ed. I just wanted to find out what happened last night. If Eve ever showed up, or what happened. Call me at work, \nED \nI thought she might have gone over there last night.  Excuse me, I better call the University. \nThe next message is Detective Derm again and it plays behind Ed's conversation. \nED \nHi, Mrs Mastrioni? \nMRS MASTRIONI \n(over phone) \nYes. \nED \nThis is Ed Saxon. \nMRS MASTRIONI \nOh, yes.  Didn't make it in today, huh? \nED \nI guess not. \nMRS MASTRIONI \nThere were students waiting for you. \nED \nYes, I know.  It's a personal matter. \nMRS MASTRIONI \nA personal matter, huh? \nED \nThat's right. \nMRS MASTRIONI \nSo you'll be in tomorrow. \nED \nYes, tomorrow. \nMRS MASTRIONI \nOr you'll call. \nED \nOr I'll call, yes.  Hello?  Hello? \nEd hangs up, having been hung up on.  He turns around to see Derm standing right by, listening to his call. \nThe next message is from George Simian, a man who works with Eve. His cautious voice makes it known that it is weird that he is calling. Ed pays special attention to this call. \nGEORGE \nHi, Eve. This is George, from school. You didn't come into work today and I just wanted to make sure everything was OK. I guess I'll see you tomorrow. \nDERM \nWho's that? \nED \nSome guy she worked with.  P.E. teacher, I think. \nDERM \nI see.  Mr Saxon, does your wife have an address book? \nED \nYes. \nDERM \nCould I see it, please?  And a picture, if you have one. \n", "test1_id": 2508, "test2_input": "I don't know. \nDERM \nWhat was her name? \nED \nSadie.  Sadie Crumb. \nDerm finds a small, printed name-tag reading Sadie Crumb sewn into the collar. Derm shows it to Mazurek and then indicates for him to go back to the bedroom. \nDerm shows the label to Ed. \nDERM \nDo you have this girl's phone number?  I'd like to talk to her. \nED \nI don't think so.  Maybe. \nEd gets up and walks into the - \nINT. LIVING ROOM \n- where his desk is.  He searches around and quickly finds a photocopy of a hand-written list of phone numbers. \nDERM \nI should call her. \nED \nSure.  Here. \nHe hands him the phone.  Derm dials the number. \nED \nI didn't tell her about my wife.  I didn't see any reason to. \nDerm reaches into his pocket and pulls out a roll of Tums. He takes a couple and chews them and it obviously puts a bad taste in his mouth. \nDERM \nCould I trouble you for a glass of water? \nED \nSure. \nEd walks into the - \nINT. HALLWAY \nHe passes by the bathroom and stops by the bedroom door. He looks into the bedroom where the officers are searching through his stuff. They find a copy of Hustler Magazine and they chuckle about it, before they notice Ed watching them. \nAs he watches, he can hear Derm talking to Sadie. \nDERM \n(O.S.) \nHi. May I speak to Sadie Crumb, please? This is Detective Derm of the Seattle Police Department. Can I ask you a few questions? \nThe officers turn and stare at Ed until he leaves. \nINT. KITCHEN \nEd takes a glass from the cupboard. He takes it over to the sink and fills it with water. The tap makes enough noise so that he can't hear anything else. \nINT. HALLWAY \nAs Ed passes the bathroom door, the gurgling noises from the plumbing get louder. He makes sure the door is firmly shot and then brings the glass of water to Derm. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nDerm hangs up the phone and drinks the water. \nDERM \nThank you. \nED \nWell? \nDERM \nShe sounded very nice.  You know, I think she left her sweater under your bed on purpose. \nED \nWhy would she do that? \nDERM \nSo that she'd have a reason to come back. \nED \nI see. \nDerm sees an open box of Skin-EE( cookies. \nDERM \nHey.  My wife loves those things.  I swear, she eats them by the box.  I think they taste like shit. \nED \nI know.  I hate them.  Sometimes I think she eats them just to spite me. \nMAZUREK \nDetective Derm. \nDerm looks at Ed, then goes into the other room.  Ed follows. \nINT. HALLWAY \n", "test2_true": "Did you go to work today, Mr Saxon? \nED \nNo.  I guess I didn't. \nDERM \nIf you'd like, I can call the University for you and explain the situation.  It might help.  I'm sure they would understand. \nED \nI don't think it's necessary. \nDERM \nWell, the offer stands if you change your mind later. \nED \nIt's just that, I don't want them to know anything about all this.  At least not yet. \nDERM \nI understand. \nThey walk into the - \nINT. BEDROOM \nMazurek is holding a small, fabric-bound writing book. \nDERM \nWhat's that? \nMAZUREK \nLooks like a diary, sir. \nDERM \nLet's have a look. \nDerm looks it over, reads the last couple of entries quickly. \nDERM \nWhere'd you find this? \nMAZUREK \nBehind the bedside table. \nED \nI didn't know. \nDERM \nWe have to keep some things to ourselves, or we'd go crazy.  This is your wife's handwriting? \nHe shows him the diary. \nED \nYes.  Can I look at that? \nDERM \nOf course. \nEd takes the diary and wanders into Eve's room, flipping through it as he walks. \nINT. EVE'S ROOM \nEd flips through the last pages of the diary. He reads for a minute. Some distant noises are coming from the neighbor's house. While we can't hear exactly what is being said, it is clear that a man is saying something funny and a woman is laughing hysterically. \nEd reads for a minute until, astonished, he puts it down and looks up at Derm, who is standing in the doorway watching him. \nED \nI guess you never really know anyone. \nDERM \nYou didn't know that you're wife is pregnant? \nED \nNo. \nDERM \nI'm sorry.  I talked to her doctor yesterday.  I thought you knew. \nMazurek comes up behind Derm and says something inaudibly in his ear. \nDERM \nIs it alright if Mazurek uses the bathroom? \nED \nExcuse me? \nDERM \nThe bathroom.  May we use the bathroom?  We might be here for a while. \nED \nNo.  The toilet is stuffed up.  Actually.  Do you mind leaving?  I just would like to be alone. \nDERM \nMr Saxon. I'm sorry about the intrusions into your privacy, but you must understand: my first priority is finding your wife. There is still a great deal to go over. We might want to notify the press. \nED \nThe press? \n", "test2_id": 2509, "test3_input": "ED \nOf course I'm worried. I'm just working right now. This girl is one of my students. She wanted some help on an assignment. She doesn't know anything about Eve being missing. \nSUSIE \nWhat happened to you? \nED \nGeorge Simian hit me. \nSUSIE \nGeorge? \nED \nYou know him.  It figures. 1tt1Susie starts crying.  Ed stares at her helplessly, then goes back inside. \nSUSIE \nWait. 1tt1Ed stops. \nSUSIE \nCan I come back later? \nED \nIt's late.  I just took some sleeping pills.  I haven't slept much since this all started.  Why don't you come back tomorrow? \nSUSIE \nTomorrow? \nED \nGood night, Susie. \nEd walks back in, leaving Susie standing on the porch. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nEd waits by the door until he hears her footsteps walking away outside. \nSadie stands up, looking nervous. \nSADIE 2t2Is that your wife? \nED 2t2No.  It was a friend of hers. \nSADIE 2t2I should go. \nED 2t2No.  Why? \nSADIE 2t2You must be tired.  Those pills must be working. \nED 2t2I don't think they're working at all. \nSADIE 2t2Still.  You're married, right? \nED 2t2Yeah, but, please don't go.  Please.  Time has a way of slowing down when you're around. \nSADIE 2t2Really?  For me, too. \nED 2t2So you'll stay? \nSADIE 2t2If you want me to. \nEd comes over to her and kisses her. \nSADIE 2t2Can I ask you something? \nED 2t2What? \nSADIE 2t2Do you think my writing is good? \nED 2t2You've done some good work. \nSADIE 2t2Yeah.  C minus good. \nED 2t2I told you, I was in a bad mood when I graded that. \nSADIE 2t2I guess so. \nShe is unresponsive at first. \nSADIE \n(to herself) 2t2What am I doing? \nThey kiss for a minute, then Ed slips his hand under the back of Sadie's sweater. \nShe kisses him again. \nINT. BEDROOM \nSadie turns the lights off and we can only see by the light coming in from the hallway. \nEd lies on the bed and Sadie lies next to him, under the covers. Ed slips his hand under the back of her sweater and fiddles with her bra while they kiss. \nThe gurgling sound starts up again, and while Sadie doesn't notice, or doesn't hear it, it becomes increasingly distracting to Ed. He looks to the bathroom where the noise is coming from. \nINT. BATHROOM \nThe camera focuses in on the drain.  The water in the bathtub starts rising again. \nINT. BEDROOM \nSadie breaks away from him, sits up and takes off her sweater.  Ed takes off his shirt. \nEd's kisses move around the side of her neck. As he reaches her ear, he looks up and notices Eve's clothes sitting on the chair. \nINT. BATHROOM \nThe water is rising slowly, but we can see solid stuff (the ashes from the diary are clearly part of the muck) seeping out of the drain with the water. It is a cloudy, dark, disgusting water which probably stinks too. \nINT. BEDROOM \nEd is trying to concentrate on Sadie, but he notices the closet door is open and there are some dresses blowing around inside. \n", "test3_true": "He turns Sadie onto her back, turning himself away from the closet. His kisses run down her chest until he gets to her jeans. He unbuttons her jeans and starts to pull them off, kissing as he goes. \nEd has taken her pants off, but his passion and enthusiasm has faded, and he stops and stares off into space, towards the bathroom. He is spooked. \nSADIE 2t2What's wrong? \nHe looks down and sees Sadie staring at him. \nED 2t2I don't know.  Maybe it's those pills.  I don't know. \nSADIE 2t2Just relax.  Lie back. \nSadie gently pushes him back and starts to go down on him. \nEd get more uptight. \nED 2t2No.  Please.  Just stop. \nShe keeps trying until Ed is forced to push her away. \nED 2t2It's just not working.  OK? \nSADIE 2t2Alright.  I'm sorry. \nSadie turns away.  She's upset. \nSADIE 2t2Maybe I should go. \nED 2t2No.  Please, don't.  It's my fault.  Please.  Don't go. \nSADIE 2t2Damn, I'm so stupid. \nED 2t2No, it's me.  Please. \nSADIE 2t2This was a mistake. \nSadie gets up and puts on her shirt.  She grabs the rest of her clothes and goes into the living room. \nEd stares after her, listening to her finish dressing herself and then leave. \nThe clock next to the bed is ticking loudly and the sound of the ticking continues of the next few scenes, as indicated. \nINT. KITCHEN \nEd pours a few more pills into his hand, swallowing them with some wine from the bottle. \nINT. BATHROOM \nEd looks at the bathtub, which is full of the murky water. He picks up the plunger, which is still by the toilet, and starts working it on the drain. \nMore stuff is coming up, making the water darker, but as he relaxes the plunger, the water doesn't go down. If anything, the gurgling sound is louder. \nHe works the plunger some more, more vigorously and then, again, relaxes it and watches the drain hopefully. The gurgling noise seems closer and the water still does not go down. \nThen he hears something hit the front door. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nEd opens the front door and picks up the newspaper which has just been thrown. He puts it with the other newspapers, which have piled up in their plastic wraps on his desk. \nINT. BATHROOM \nHe comes back into the bathroom and looks at the bathtub. \nHe puts the plunger over the drain and works it much harder and, this time, after a few seconds, there is a loud knock in the pipes, as if he hit something. He takes the plunger away and watches the drain. \nSuddenly, a large air bubble bursts out of the drain.  He watches, but the water shows no sign of draining. \nThen, slowly, blood starts to leak into the tub from the drain. \nEd is naturally terrified by this.  He watches until it is clear that it is blood and not just more gook. \nHe puts plunger back on the drain and pumps it a few more frantic times. More blood seeps out of the drain. He seems to be making the problem worse. \nHe shuts the shower curtain and backs out of the bathroom. \nINT. KITCHEN \nHe spills the pills on the kitchen counter and counts them quickly. There are about ten left. He pours them into his mouth and swallows the rest of the wine. \nThen the ticking stops.  Ed looks at a clock on the wall.  The second hand has stopped. \nHe hears voices in the other room. \nINT. EVE'S ROOM \nHe looks out of the window in Eve's room. He sees that the light in the neighbor's window is on. The couple next door are having another argument, but this one is much more intense than the last. \nWOMAN \n(O.S.) 2t2Why do you care! You don't care! You know nothing about me! I hate you! Stay away from me! I'll scream! I am not screaming now! You think you're the only one? Yes, I do! I LOVE YOU! You never do that! You do not! You never do anything! You think that nothing's wrong! You think we live in paradise! This is what I think of this fucking house! \nThere is the sound of things breaking. \nWOMAN \n(O.S.) \nIT'S NOT MY FAULT! IT'S NOT MY FAULT! THEN DON'T! I AM NOT! I LOVE YOU! FUCK YOU! I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU SAID THAT! STAY AWAY FROM ME! YOU RUINED MY LIFE! STAY AWAY FROM ME! STOP IT! SHUT UP! STAY AWAY FROM ME! NO! STOP IT! YOU SON OF A BITCH! HELP! HELP! \nThis ends with a loud, terrifying shriek.  It seems to echo around the room as Ed watches.  Then the voices stop. \nEd watches the window and sees a featureless man stick his head through the curtains to see if anybody is listening. Then he closes the window and curtains. \nThe phone rings in the other room. \nINT. KITCHEN \nHe hurries to answer the phone. \nWhile he is on the phone, a new sound is coming from the bathroom.  It is like the gurgling sound, but also subtly different. \nED \nHello. \nDERM \nMr Saxon? \nED \n", "test3_id": 2510}

MABEL Guess who's been asking for you? 
SAMMY Oh no, really? 
Mabel nods and passes by. 
SAMMY KNOCKS on a big door that says "Manager" and has half the letters of the previous branch manager's name taken off it. 
BRIAN (Inside) Yeah, come in! 
Sammy swings open the door. BRIAN EVERETT, the new branch manager, is unpacking a box. Sammy is surprised to see he is in his early thirties and very good-looking in a boyish sort of way; he wears shirt-sleeves and tie, and a wedding ring. 
SAMMY Mr. Everett? 
BRIAN Yeah: Brian. 
SAMMY Brian. Hi. I'm Samantha Prescott -- I'm the lending officer? 
BRIAN Yeah, hi, how are you? Come on in. Sit down. 
Sammy comes into the office and sits. 
SAMMY I am so sorry I was late... 
BRIAN Yeah, we missed you before... 
SAMMY I got held up. Believe me, it is not something I make a habit of... 
BRIAN I'm sure it's not. Actually -- could you just, could you close that door for me? Thanks. 
Sammy gets up and closes the door. 
INT. BRIAN'S OFFICE. LATER 
Sammy sits in front of Brian's desk. Brian is behind the desk listening. 
SAMMY -- so I always just run out at 3:15 to pick him up and then run him real quick over to the sitter's house. Anyway, Larry never minded about it and I was just hoping it would be OK with you too... 
BRIAN Well -- Samantha -- I realize that Scottsville is not exactly a major banking center... 
SAMMY No it's not... 
BRIAN No -- I know it's not... But it's kind of a personal challenge to me to see what we can do to bring local service up to the same kinds of standards we'd be trying to meet if we were the biggest branch in the state. And that means I don't want anybody running out at 3:15 or 3:30, or whenever the bus happens to come in that day. Now is there anybody else who can pick your son up after school? Does your husband work in the area? Do you -- 
SAMMY Oh -- No -- Rudy Sr. isn't "on the scene." So to speak. 
BRIAN Well, I can give you a couple of days to make some other arrangement, but... 
SAMMY Well -- Brian? I understand what you're saying, and I think it's great. I do. Because there's a lot of things around here that could use some attention. Believe me. But I've honestly been meeting that bus every day for four years now and it really does take just fifteen minutes, and if I take the time out of my lunch hour... 
BRIAN I'd really prefer it if you would make some other arrangement. OK? 
SAMMY (Brightly) I'll do my best...! 
Brian kicks back in his chair and puts his hands behind his head. 
BRIAN How old's your son? 
SAMMY He's eight. 
BRIAN That's a terrific age. 
INT. SAMMY'S CAR (MOVING). DUSK 
Sammy and Rudy drive home in silence. The orange sunlight flickers through the trees and onto their faces as they drive along. 
EXT. PRESCOTT (SAMMY'S) HOUSE. DUSK 
The same house that Sammy grew up in, with sixteen years' more wear on it. 
Sammy's car swings expertly by the mailbox, and Rudy reaches half his body out of the passenger window and gets the mail. 
INT. SAMMY'S HOUSE. DUSK

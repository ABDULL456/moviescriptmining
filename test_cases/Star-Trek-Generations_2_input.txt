FADE IN: 
1   EXT. SPACE (VFX-I)                                           1 
A vast and sparkling starfield. A pinpoint of LIGHT appears and starts moving toward the camera... a small and distant cylindrical object tumbling end over end, but we can't determine exactly what it is yet... 
2   EXT. WHEATFIELD - DAY                                        2 
A vast and undulating sea of wheat. We become aware that there are two HEADS sticking out of the stalks of wheat: two men are standing and looking up at the sky. As we move towards them,  we begin to hear their conversation...and we can see that the two men are SCOTTY and CHEKOV, dressed in civilian clothing. 
CHEKOV (points to sky) There he is -- there, to the South! 
SCOTTY (peers upward) What are ye, blind? That's a bird. 
As they stare up at the sky... 
3   EXT. SPACE (VFX-I)                                           3 
The cylinder tumbling through space is now closer, and we can now see that it is a BOTTLE of some sort, and it is tumbling directly toward the camera... 
4   EXT. WHEATFIELD- DAY                                         4 
As before, Chekov and Scotty staring at the sky. 
SCOTTY (concerned) Repelling the Crystalline Trench... rafting down lava flows... orbital skydiving. it's like the man is running a bloody decathlon across the galaxy. 
Suddenly we hear a double SONIC BOOM. 
CHEKOV (re: sound) That should be him now. I think he's just crossed the sound barrier. 
They shield their eyes against the sun and look up. 
5   EXT. SPACE (VFX-I)                                           5 
The bottle gets CLOSER... 
6   EXT. WHEATFIELD - DAY                                        6 
A man in a high-tech body harness and parachute LANDS in the wheat flat on his back. His body-suit is charred, scorched, wisps of smoke still curling off of it. There are small thrusters attached to his backpack and boots. Scotty and Chekov move to him. The man removes his helmet. Revealing that it is KIRK. He smiles broadly, like a child who has just come off a roller-coaster. 
KIRK Right on target! I jump out over the Arabian Peninsula... and I end up here, right on the dime. 
Kirk gets to his feet. 
CHEKOV Actually, Captain, your precise target area was thirty-five meters... (points) That way. 
KIRK Thanks for pointing that out. 
Kirk starts to pull off his suit, reacts to a sudden pain in his back. 
KIRK Oh... 
SCOTTY I've warned ye about that back of yours. You should have a doctor take a look at it. 
Kirk waves him away, and continues to remove his harness. 
6A   EXT. SPACE (VFX-I)                                          6A 
The tumbling bottle rushes past, and we can now see that it is a CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE - Dom Perignon, 2265. Follow the bottle as it tumbles through space... 
6B   EXT. WHEATFIELD - DAY                                       6B 
Kirk, Scotty and Chekov as before. 
KIRK Tomorrow I want to make a tri- elliptical jump. That's where you jump out over Northern China, and make three complete orbits before you start re-entry... 
CHEKOV Captain. Perhaps you have forgotten that tomorrow is the christening ceremony. 
This strikes a nerve with Kirk -- we see a flash of hesitation and irritation cross his face. 
KIRK I'm not going. (beat) Scotty, help me with this chute. 
SCOTTY What do you mean, you're not going? We promised. 
KIRK When I retired, I swore I'd never set foot on a starship again, and I meant it.

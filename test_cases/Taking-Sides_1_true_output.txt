STEVE (quiet, terrifying) Have you ever smelled burning flesh? I smelt it four miles away. Four miles away, I smelt it. Have you ever seen the gas chambers, the crematoria? Have you seen the mounds of rotting corpses? You talk to me about culture, art and music? You putting that in the scales, Wilhelm? You setting culture, art and music against the millions put to death by your pals? They had orchestras in the camps. They played Beethoven, Wagner. The hangmen were playing chamber music at home with their families. I don't understand the Germans' relationship with music. What do you need music for? Your pals you could call to save a few Jews when millions of them were being annihilated? Yes, I blame you for not getting hanged, I blame you for your cowardice. You strutted and swaggered, you fucking piece of shit, king-pin in a shithouse. You talk to me about walking a tightrope between exile and the gallows, and I say to you, lies! 
FURTWÄNGLER (breaking down) I love my country, I believe in music, what was I to do? 
STEVE Look around you. See the country you served. Look at people who had real courage, who took risks, who risked their lives. Like Emmi's father. 
He sees Emmi has her fingers in her ears, yells at her. 
STEVE Emmi, take your fingers out of your ears! 
She does so. 
STEVE I'm talking about your father. 
She screams. Stillness. All eyes on her. 
EMMI My father only joined the plot when he realised that we could not win the war.  She cries quietly. 
FURTWÄNGLER (desperate) What kind of a world do you want, Major? What kind of world are you going to make? Do you honestly believe that the only reality is the material world, so you will be left nothing, nothing but feculence... more foul-smelling than that which pervades your nights... (near to breakdown) How was I to understand, how was I to know what they were capable of? No one knew. No one knew. 
He breaks down, buries his face in his hands, weeps. 
FURTWÄNGLER I don't want to stay in this country. Yes, I should have left in 1934, it would have been better if I'd left... 
He is suddenly overtaken by nausea and faintness, stands, a hand to his mouth. Emmi goes to him. 
STEVE Get him out of here. 
Emmi helps Furtwängler out. Steve strides to the window, opens it, puts his head out into the fresh air. 
INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY 
Emmi helps Furtwängler to a chair. She watches him solicitously. He breathes deeply. 
FURTWÄNGLER Thank you, Fraulein. You have been most kind. (he rises.) He smiles at her. She is embarrassed. 
INT. STEVE'S OFFICE - DAY 
Steve is trying to get a number on the telephone. David is packing up his papers. 
David turns to the records, starts to son through until he finds what he's looking for. He removes the Bruckner and puts another record on the turntable. 
STEVE (into the telephone) Major Arnold. Get me General Wallace. General? Major Arnold, about Furtwängler. I don't know if we've got a case that'll stand up, but sure as hell we can give him a hard time.

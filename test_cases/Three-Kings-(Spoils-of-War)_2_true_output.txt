WES Where'd they go? 
EPPS I don't know.  There's a lot of space up here.  They could be just about-- 
WES Weird they didn't chase us. 
JAEGER Maybe they're as scared of us as we are of them. 
WES Just seems weird they didn't chase us. 
EPPS What's weird is how they disappeared. Doesn't make sense.  Doesn't... 
There is a sound; a steady swooshing that starts faint and grows closer like a rolling thunder.  Our three start looking around, turning where they stand, trying to find the source of the sound as it rises to a near deafening pitch.  There's nothing.  They see nothing.  Still the sound races closer and closer.  Epps, Jaeger and Wes raise up their weapons in preparation to defend themselves against this unseen beast. 
From below the edge of the mesa a HELICOPTER GUNSHIP - probably a MIL MI-24 HIND-D ARMED ASSAULT HELICOPTER if you want to be technical - raises up very dramatically into sight.  It hangs in the air ominously before our soldiers. On board are the vanished Iraqis wearing nasty grins.  The PILOT brings the gunship about and levels her massive machine cannons at our boys. 
EPPS(CONT) Scatter! 
Wes and Jaeger don't have to be told twice.  They bolt from their spots, and not an instant too soon.  The GUNNER lets fly a barrage of shells that literally tear up the ground where our boys were just standing.  We see what the chopter's weapons will do to rock.  We can imagine what they would do to flesh. 
Epps, Jaeger and Wes take cover behind some rocks.  The gunship swings around, picks up speed and bears down on them. 
More shells fired.  They punch into and through the rocks our boys use for cover.  Again the three scatter, and just in time as the shells rip their way through the rock. 
Our three go sliding down an embankment, crouching low. Their heads whip around looking for the gunship. 
JAEGER Where is it?  Where'd it go? 
EPPS Stay low. 
JAEGER Where the hell is it!? 
EPPS Just stay down. 
In answer to Jaeger's question the gunship comes swooping up behind them like a bird of prey.  Our three have all of about a second to get running before the Iraqis send more shells their way.  They kick up chunks of rock as they ping, ping, ping around Epps, Wes and Jaeger who make a wild, evasive run. 
Dig it:  Up ahead is a narrow passage through rock face. They race for it, hurl themselves into it as the gunship sends a special delivery of white-hot metal their way. 
Once inside the passage they have a bit of breathing space. It's too narrow for the gunship to get a good shot through. Our three press themselves up against the rock walls and suck air. 
Beyond the opening to the passage the gunship swings back and forth like a junkyard dog patrolling its kingdom. 
Jaeger's worked up a real scare. 
JAEGER What are we going to do?  What the hell are we going to do? 
EPPS We're not going to do anything. 
JAEGER (Panicked) They're going to kill us! 
EPPS They can't shoot us in here. 
WES And they can't fly around out there forever. 
EPPS So we wait. 
JAEGER If they land-- 
EPPS If they land, we can take them.  If they don't land, then we've got nothing to worry about. 
Wes watches the gunship as it seemingly settles in the air. It floats very steady as if...  Wes' eyes key in on something:  The gunship's missile pods rotating slightly, coming in line... Wes' eyes go wide like someone just jammed an electric cattle prod in his ass. 
WES Missile! 
EPPS Move! 
Epps, Wes and Jaeger sprint for the opening at the far end of the passage as a missile rockets from the gunship's pod. With a wild whine it rides the wind like a deadly arrow straight into the passage.  Slamming into the ground it sprouts a terrific fireball that rides on a massive explosion.  It races through the passage, lifts our boys from the ground and tosses them out into the open like they were nothing more than discarded ragdolls. 
Jaeger takes cover and cowers.  He puts his panic into overdrive. 
Wes pulls his rifle.  Grunting like an animal he sprays bullets at the chopter, but it's like throwing snowballs at an elephant.  The gunship turns on Wes and fires in his direction.  It doesn't hit him, but it sends him running. 
Epps has had enough of this shit.  He scrambles to load a grenade in his launcher as the gunship comes about.  It races for him, cannons at the ready.  This one is going to be close.  Epps locks and loads just as the chopter swings down on him.  Epps fires, but the gunship simply jukes up and away from the grenade the way someone might step over a bug.  The grenade impacts the rock face behind the chopter exploding harmlessly.  The chopter returns the favor by reining down a hail of shells that kicks Epps back FLIPPING HIM UP AND OVER the edge of the plateau.  His M-16 goes flying, smashing into the ground far below.  Epps manages to grab hold of the plateau lip with one hand.  It swings him around, slamming him hard against the cliff face.  He hangs there, suspended by his weakening grip, far above the ground. 
JAEGER Epps! 
Jaeger and Wes run to him, grabbing him by his arm.  They pull and pull hard until Epps can get some kind of purchase, and crawl his way back up to the plateau. 
At the same time the gunship lowers itself so that it hovers above and beyond our three.  It rotates so that the bay doors are facing Epps, Wes and Jaeger.  Three Iraqis are inside, weapons trained on our targets.  One of them yells something. Wes translates. 
WES They want us to surrender. 
The three share a nervous look.  Epps fairly growls: 
EPPS Yeah, I'll surrender.

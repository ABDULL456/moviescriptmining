Morgan pulls back his vest, revealing Virgil's badge.  Wyatt drops into a corner chair, defeated.  Morgan makes a shot, leaving only the 8 ball.  A few beats.  Seeing Wyatt's misery, Morgan softens, poking him with the cue.  Wyatt looks up. Morgan taps the middle pocket.  Wyatt shakes his head. 
MORGAN How much you wanna bet? 
Wyatt holds up his watch.  Morgan frowns.  Wyatt raises his brows: 
WYATT I just got it fixed. 
MORGAN You're on. 
Morgan has to lean over the table but he sinks the 8 ball, looking over at Wyatt in triumph.  Wyatt applauds, rolling his eyes just as a BULLET SPANGS into the wall by his head.  Wyatt dives for the floor as ANOTHER SHOT pierces the window.  Wyatt jumps up, bounding to the door to see several FIGURES cash into the darkness.  Wyatt turns back and freezed.  Morgan lies across the table with one leg dangling over the edge, jerking and shuddering involuntarily.  Wyatt rushes to him.  The dog whines as Doc rushes in with Kate and McMasters.  Wyatt is trembling. 
WYATT No, no!  Get the doctor!  Jesus Christ! 
INTO - ORIENTAL - NIGHT 
The curious crowd outside, watching through the windows. Morgan is on the pool table, lying on his side with his shirt pulled up.  The dog cowers in the corner, whining while Dr. Goodfellow digs into the wound with a steel probe, making Morgan writhe in perfect agony.  The doctor turns to Wyatt: 
DR. GOODFELLOW Hold him. 
Wyatt takes Morgan in his arms.  The doctor probes.  Morgan jerks violently.  Suddenly we hear a blood-curdling SCREAM. Louisa is in the doorway, tearing her hair, lost in utter hysterics. 
WYATT Oh, no, get her out of her!  Jesus! 
And now the whole scene sinks into hellish confusion with the dog whimpering, Louisa shrieking as others restrain her, and Morgan gives a violet jerk, breaking Wyatt's grip.  The doctor snarls, about at the end of his rope. 
DR. GOODFELLOW I said hold him, God damn it! 
WYATT Somebody shut that dog up! 
Morgan takes Wyatt's arm, his voice like a child's. 
MORGAN You were right, Wyatt.  They got Me good.  Don't let 'em get you Too. 
WYATT Will somebody get the damn dog out- 
MORGAN Remember about the light you're Supposed to see when you're dyin'? 
WYATT Easy Morg, don't think about that now. 
MORGAN Isn't true.  I can't see a damn thing. 
Tears well up in Wyatt's eyes.  He touches his brother's face. Morgan's eyelids start fluttering.  Wyatt squeezes his hand. 
WYATT Morgan?  Morgan! 
The dog starts howling, long and loud and pitiful-and in the next moment the air is FILLED with howls as every dog and coyote for miles joins in the mourning.  Wyatt backs away from his dead brother and trudges out onto the sidewalk, staring at the blood on his hands.  Standing in the crowd across the street, Josephine sees Wyatt and starts for him.  Behan grabs her.  She wrenches free and with the whole town watching, starts running toward Wyatt.  Seeing her, Wyatt backs away in horror, shaking his head: 
WYATT No, no, get away, get away from me... 
JOSEPHINE Wyatt... 
She keeps coming.  Wyatt panics.  Finally, in desperation: 
WYATT Whore!  Filthy whore!  Get away From me! 
She pauses, unable to believe her ears, then runs away crying. Fuming with rage, Kate starts after Wyatt.  Doc pulls her back: 
DOC Can't you see why he did it? 
The howls continue as Wyatt trudges down the street alone. Suddenly he doubles over, clutching his abdomen in agony, staring at his bloody hands.... 
EXT - ALLEN STREET - DAY 
The wagon bearing Morgan's pine coffin waits in the street, hitched and ready.  Virgil is up front with the women, arm in a sling, pale.  Doc and Kate wait on horses nearby.  Finished loading, Wyatt looks around.  People line the street, watching in silence.  Clum and his wounded wife turn away from the window of their lodgings next door, unable to meet his gaze. The very air feels charged with paranoia and recrimination, as if the whole town has suddenly become morally radio-active. Bystanders gape as Josephine steps out of the hotel, regal and impervious as a queen, wearing a gawking scorn like a mink coat, her little white dog scampering after her.  Passing Behan, he gives her nasty look and spits.  She doesn't even break stride.  Lounging in front of the Crystal Palace with the other Cowboys, Stillwell gives Curly Bill an enquiring look. 
CURLY BILL Naw, she's nobody.  Wyatt junked her. 
Passing Wyatt, she doesn't even glance at him.  Doc sighs: 
DOC And so she walked out of our Lives forever. 
Without a word Wyatt climbs onto the wagon and shakes the reins, driving off.  He pulls up in front of the Cowboys. They make a show of pretending to hide their guns.  Wyatt looks straight ahead: 
WYATT I want you to know it's over. We're leaving and we're not Coming back. 
CURLY BILL Well... 'bye. 
RINGO (sniffs) Hey, you smell that?  Smells like Something died. 
CURLY BILL (stifling a laugh) Oh, Jesus, Johnny... 
Allie's eyes flare, Louisa stifles a sob.  The Cowboys snicker. Wyatt clenches his teeth, still staring straight ahead, and drives on.  A few beats then Curly Bill turns to Ike:

CONTINUED: An eighteen-wheel flatbed loaded with trimmed logs blocks the road. Men in reflective vests stand on the flatbed, securing the load with chains. Kayla hits the brakes and checks-her watch. She's late. She taps the horn. A FOREMAN ambles over to her, in no particular rush. 
FOREMAN Can't move the truck till the load's tied down. 
KAYLA Please? I'm already late. 
FOREMAN Not gonna happen, ma'am... The foreman thinks about it, sighs, and changes his tune. FOREMAN (cont'd) (yelling to truck driver) Hey Zeke! Pull this mother over. Lady's got to get through. Moments later the truck rolls forward, enabling Kayla to scoot through in her pickup. She toots her horn and waves. 
KAYLA Thanks, fellas. 
EXT. TIMBER STAND - MORNING 
Logan and three other lumberjacks-- PHELAN, MARCUSE, and VAN MIER-- tramp through the woods towards their designated area, carrying their chainsaws and helmets. Phelan, whiskey-bellied and flushed from the exertion, has fallen behind. 
PHELAN You all want to ease the pace a little bit? Trees ain't going anywhere. Logan, in the lead, stares at a crude smiley face carved into a tall pine tree. His gaze travels from the carving to something sitting on the forest floor. (CON'TNt1F.n I 
lB. 
CONTINUED: PHELAN (cont'd) What you got there? The other lumberjacks gather around Logan. A severed bear's head, haloed by buzzing flies, rots in the sun. PHELAN (cont'd) Goddamn. 
VAN MIER Hunter? 
MARCUSE Why would a hunter leave the head? 
LOGAN Bullet didn't kill this bear. 
(BEAT) Claws did. 
INT. TRUCK - MORNING 
Kayla sings along with the tape on the tape deck. 
KAYLA Lolly Lolly Lolly get your adverbs here, Lolly Lolly Lolly got some adverbs here, Come on down to Lolly's get the adverbs here... Rounding a corner on the narrow access road, Kayla nearly collides with a man in a long black coat. She slams on the brakes and the truck shudders to a halt. The man's back is turned to the truck, his head bowed. His hair hangs below his shoulders, clotted with dirt, as if he's been sleeping in the woods for weeks. Kayla leans out of the open truck window. Before she can speak, the man in the long black coat turns. It's not just his size that frightens us, though the man is massive. It's not just the four-inch-long black talons curling from his fingertips, or the gleaming fangs he licks as he smiles at her. What terrifies us most are his eyes. They are a shark's eyes, black and loveless and utterly inhuman. f CONTTNT1FD' 
CONTINUED: Victor Creed walks toward the truck. He scrapes his talons over the hood: screeeeee. Five parallel gashes now scar the hood, carved straight through the steel. 
EXT. TIMBER STAND - CONTINUOUS 
Logan, hearing a noise the other men can't, rises from his crouch. He looks to the west, listening carefully. 
PHELAN What's the matter-- Logan holds up a hand: quiet. He hears a distant scream. A. voice he knows better than any other. He runs, leaving his astonished co-workers behind. No one can run through the woods faster than Logan and'Logan has never needed to run faster. He vaults fallen trees, ducks under branches, accelerates when he hits the access road. 
EXT. ACCESS ROAD - MINUTES LATER 
Logan sees the pickup truck in the distance. Even a hundred yards away he can tell that something is.wrong. It seems impossible that he could run any faster, but now he does, reaching the truck in seconds. He sees the claw marks gouged through the steel hood. He sees.the driver's side door tossed onto the asphalt twenty yards. from the truck. And finally he sees Kayla, curled in the fetal position on the side of the access road. Blood puddles beneath her. Her skin has already begun to lose its 'color. He runs to her, kneels beside her body, hands checking for a pulse, listening for breath, trying desperately to find any sign of life in her lifeless form.

SALIERI Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip. 
CAVALIERI Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart. 
SALIERI Oh? News travels fast in Vienna. 
CAVALIERI And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true? 
SALIERI Yes. 
CAVALIERI Is there a part for me? 
SALIERI No. 
CAVALIERI How do you know? 
SALIERI Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one. 
CAVALIERI Why not? 
SALIERI Well, do you know where it's set, my dear? 
CAVALIERI Where? 
SALIERI In a harem. 
CAVALIERI What's that? 
SALIERI A brothel. 
CAVALIERI Oh! 
SALIERI A Turkish brothel. 
CAVALIERI Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it. 
SALIERI My dear, it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout Vienna as a singing prostitute for a Turk. 
He seats himself at the forte-piano. 
CAVALIERI Oh. Well perhaps you could introduce us anyway. 
SALIERI Perhaps. 
He plays a chord. She sings a scale, expertly. He strikes another chord. She starts another scale, then breaks off. 
CAVALIERI What does he look like? 
SALIERI You might be disappointed. 
CAVALIERI Why? 
SALIERI Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina. 
CAVALIERI (airily) Looks don't concern me, Maestro. Only talent interests a woman of taste. 
He strikes the chord again, firmly. Cavalieri sings her next scale, then another one, and another one, doing her exercises in earnest. As she hits a sustained high note the orchestral accompaniment in the middle of Martern Aller Arten from Il Seraglio comes in underneath and the music changes from exercises to the exceedingly florid aria. 
We DISSOLVE on the singer's face, and she is suddenly not merely turbaned, but painted and dressed totally in a Turkish manner, and we are on: 
INT. OPERA STAGE - VIENNA - 1780'S 
The heroine of the opera (Cavalieri) is in full cry addressing the Pasha with scorn and defiance. 
The house is full. Watching the performance - which is conducted by Mozart from the clavier in the midst of the orchestra - we note Von Strack, Orsini-Rosenberg, Bonno and Von Swieten, all grouped around the Emperor, in a box. 
In another box we see an overdressed, middle-aged woman and three girls, one of whom is Constanze. This is the formidable MADAME WEBER and her three daughters, Constanze, JOSEFA and SOPHIE. All are enraptured by the spectacle and Madame Weber is especially enraptured by being there at all. Not so, Salieri, who sits in another box, coldly watching the stage. 
Cavalieri is singing Martern aller Arten from the line Doch du bist entschlossen. 
CAVALIERI Since you are determined, Since you are determined, Calmly, with no ferment, Welcome - every pain and woe. Bind me then - compel me! Bind me then - compel me! Hurt me. Break me! Kill me! At last I shall be freed by death! 
After a few moments of this showy aria, with the composer and the singer staring at each other - he conducting elaborately for her benefit, and she following his beat with rapturous eyes - the music fades, and Salieri speaks over it. 
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) There she was. I had no idea where they met - or how - yet there she stood on stage for all to see. Showing off like the greedy songbird she was. Ten minutes of ghastly scales and arpeggios, whizzing up and down like fireworks at a fairground. 
Music up again for the last 30 bars of the aria. 
CAVALIERI (singing) Be freed at last by death! Be freed at last by death! At last I shall be freed By! Death! 
Before the orchestral coda ends, cut to: 
INT. OLD SALIERI'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT - 1823 
Through the window we see that night has fallen. 
OLD SALIERI Understand, I was in love with the girl. Or at least in lust. I wasn't a saint. It took me the most tremendous effort to be faithful to my vow. I swear to you I never laid a finger on her. All the same, I couldn't bear to think of anyone else touching her - least of all the Creature. 
CUT BACK TO: 
INT.   THE OPERA HOUSE - VIENNA - NIGHT - 1780'S 
The brilliant Turkish finale of Seraglio bursts over us. All the cast is lined up on stage. Mozart is conducting with happy excitement. 
CAST OF SERAGLIO (singing) Pasha Selim May he Live forever! Ever, ever, ever, ever! Honour to his regal name! Honour to his regal name! May his noble brow emblazon Glory, fortune, joy and fame! Honour be to Pasha Selim Honour to his regal name! Honour to his regal name! 
The curtains fall. Much applause. The Emperor claps vigorously and - following his lead - so do the courtiers. The curtains part. Mozart applauds the singers who applaud him back. He skips up onto the stage amongst them. The curtains fall again as they all bow. In the auditorium, the chandeliers descend, filling it with light. 
INT. OPERA HOUSE STAGE -  VIENNA - NIGHT - 1780'S 
The curtains are down, and an excited hubbub of singers in costume surround Mozart and Cavalieri, all excited and chattering. Suddenly a hush. The Emperor is seen approaching from the wings, lit by flunkies holding candles. Von Strack, Orsini-Rosenberg and Von Swieten, amongst others, follow him. Also Salieri. The singers line up. Joseph stops at Cavalieri who makes a deep curtsey. 
JOSEPH Bravo, Madame. You are an ornament to our stage. 
CAVALIERI Majesty. 
JOSEPH (to Salieri) And to you, Court Composer. Your pupil has done you great credit. 
INT. BACKSTAGE CORRIDOR -  VIENNA - NIGHT - 1780'S 
MADAME WEBER Let us pass, please! Let us pass at once! We're with the Emperor.

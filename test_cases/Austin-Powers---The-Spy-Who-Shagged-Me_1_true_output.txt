PULL BACK FURTHER to reveal a beautiful MYSTERIOUS WOMAN watching both of them. From this distance we can't tell who she is. 
A sign reads "BE-IN FOR PEACE". HIPPIES, MODS, and FREAKS of all descriptions dance to the music of a PSYCHEDELIC BAND. The band's name is on the drum kit: "MING TEA." 
AUSTIN Alright, baby, a swinging shin-dig! 
Austin gets into the dancing, quickly becoming the center of the scene. The lead singer of the band invites him on stage and hands him the microphone as the band starts a new song: "SEXUAL REVOLUTION." 
Austin begins singing and a choreographed musical number begins involving the outdoor crowd a la Bob Fosse's Sweet Charity or Hair. 
AUSTIN (singing) 'THERE'S A SEXUAL REVOLUTION, YOU CAN FEEL IT IN THE AIR.  PEOPLE SHAGGING JUST LIKE WEASELS AND THEY JUST DON'T SEEM TO CARE. 
Hip-thrusting young MOD FREAKS Fosse-hump rhythmically. 
AUSTIN (singing) HEY, WATCH OUT SQUARES...  YOU MAKES US BORED!  THE PENIS IS MIGHTIER THAN THE SWORD 
Austin does various groovy dance moves like THE ROCK 'EM SOCK 'EM ROBOT and THE HEAVYWEIGHT. 
AUSTIN (singing) THERE'S A SEXUAL REVOLUTION AND YOU AIN'T SEEN NOTHING YET PEOPLE SHAGGING IN THE CLUBS AND INSIDE A JUMBO JET 
Forty Austins appear in a KALEIDOSCOPE EFFECT. 
AUSTIN (singing) HEY SQUARE WORLD THE END IS NIGH. WHEN WE SAY HUMP YOU SAY 'HOW HIGH?' 
Three GROOVY CHICKS behind Austin suddenly have tambourines for the big finale. The assassin and the mysterious woman are both in the audience, keeping an eye on Austin. All we see of the woman are shots of her BOOTS, CLOTHES, and a FEMALE SYMBOL MEDALLION. 
AUSTIN (singing) SO GO MAKE LOVE OR MASTURBATE-- SEXUAL FREEDOM WILL NEVER BE OUT OF DAAAAAAAAAAATE! 
Austin holds the note an improbably long time, arms outstretched. 
The dancers crouch-walk towards the camera. 
EVERYONE (chanting) FREE-- LOVE! (louder) FREE-- LOVE! (louder) FREE-- LOVE! (shouting) IT'S THE SIXTIES! 
The SONG ENDS and all the dancers end up on one knee with their arms outstretched, panting. Austin breathes heavily and smiles smugly like Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance. 
We are TIGHT ON Austin's ass. PULL BACK to see that it is the MYSTERIOUS WOMAN who is watching Austin's ass. She SMILES behind the binoculars hiding her face. 
37 EXT. CARNABY ST. 
Austin walks down the street looking at his new BEATLES ALBUM. 
Sitting in a parked Citroen watching him is the ASSASSIN. 
The Aryan assassin nods to a SHOE-SHINE on the street. 
The shoe-shine boy nods to a BUSINESS MAN in a Homburg. 
The business man nods to a BOBBY. 
The bobby nods to a WOMAN WITH A BABY CARRIAGE. 
The woman with a baby carriage nods to a MIME. 
The mime nods to a BLIND BEGGAR with a tin cup. 
The blind beggar nods to a CARPENTER on a roof. 
The carpenter FLASHES A LIGHT to an INDIAN CHIEF. 
The Indian Chief gives a SMOKE SIGNAL to a TELEGRAPH OPERATOR. 
The telegraph operator sends a signal to the BEEFEATER GUARD. 
The Beefeater salutes with his pike to a SEXY TICKET COLLECTOR on a double-decker bus. 
The sexy ticket collector signals a TAXI DRIVER.

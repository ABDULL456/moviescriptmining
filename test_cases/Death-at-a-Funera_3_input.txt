(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Suddenly the door opens and Norman enters. 
NORMAN Aaron, do you know what was in this cake, I- ANGLE ON: Frank who looks at Norman bug eyed hoping he'll help. 
RYAN Shut the goddamn door! Shocked, Norman does as he's told. It takes Norman a moment to register that Aaron and Ryan are sitting on top of Frank. Frank continues screaming through the cloth. 
NORMAN What is going on? Who is that guy? Ryan thinks quickly. 
RYAN He's having a seizure. 
NORMAN I just found some Valium outside. Would that help? 
RYAN Yeah. Great. Give him some. Frank shakes his head "no." Norman gets on his knees with the guys and opens the bottle. 
NORMAN It's okay. This should help. calm you down. Frank tries to protest, but can't. Ryan holds Frank's mouth open as Aaron holds his nose closed. Norman pours a few pills into Frank's mouth, then Ryan holds Frank's mouth shut. Suddenly the door opens again and Jeff walks in. 
JEFF Have you seen a little brown pill bottle lying around-- They all turn to Jeff. Frank looks at him, hoping this time he'll get saved. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
RYAN Norman! I told you to lock the damn door. 
NORMAN You said "shut the damn door." Jeff locks the door and looks shocked. 
JEFF What's going on? 
NORMAN He's having a seizure. 
JEFF Why is he all tied up? No one knows what to say. 
EXT. ROOF - SAME TIME 
Oscar stands on the roof, naked, breathing in the fresh air. 
INT. STUDY - DAY 
Jeff, Aaron, Ryan and Norman are all kneeling over Frank. 
JEFF He's blackmailing you? Over what? 
AARON If I could tell everybody, it wouldn't be blackmail. 
RYAN Look, just trust us. He's the bad guy. We'll explain later. 
NORMAN What are you going to do with him? Everyonerealizes they have no answer to this question. 
AARON Yeah, Ryan, what are we going to do with him? Ryan doesn't have any answers. 
RYAN I don't know. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
AARON You don't know?! Come on, you're the big writer. You're the one who came up with "Black Hurt." Dream up something where we all live happily ever after. We can't keep him tied up forever. How long do you think those Valium are going to last? 
JEFF Valium? 
NORMAN Yeah, I found that bottle of Valium. We gave him a few to calm him down. Norman hands him the bottle. 
JEFF Ah shit! Jeff stands up and heads over to the door. 
AARON What? 
FRANK 
(MUFFLED) What? They all head over to Jeff. Frank looks extremely curious to know what's going on. Everyone talks very quietly so that Frank can't hear. 
RYAN What is it? 
JEFF The thing is... those pills aren't really Valium. It's acid and... acid. 
AARON What?! 
JEFF Oscar took one by mistake. That's why he's acting crazy. 
AARON Jeff, what the hell are you doing with this stuff?

PHIL Were you been? 
JUSTINE Gwen got real sick today. She was throwin' up all over the store. I had to take her to the hositpal, and sat with her. 
PHIL Did she sick up on you? 
JUSTINE No. 
PHIL Did she sick up on anybody? (chuckles) 
JUSTINE It's not funny, Phil, this is serious. I'm gonna go up there tomorrow too. And the next day. 
JACK Justine? What happened to you? 
JUSTINE What? 
JACK I went down to St. Catherine's to check up on Gwen. I looked all over for you, she was askin' for you. 
JUSTINE Well, how is she? 
JACK She was heavin' up until there was nothin' left to heave. Doctor said she must've eaten somethin' with some kind of parasite in it or somethin'. 
JUSTINE I bet it was those blackberries. 
JACK They're gonna keep her in there until she gets better so you're gonna have to supervise cosmetics. 
(there they go again) 
JUSTINE Stop it, somebody's gonna see!

JACOBS (CONT'D) We're not ready for human trials. Hell, we weren't ready for monkey trials. 
WILL They're apes. 
JACOBS This is what we're going to do: You're taking a sabbatical. I'll let the board handle the lawsuit. When this blows over I'll bring you back and we'll start over - we'll do it right this time. With mice. Tiny mice that can't hurt anybody. Will finds to his dismay that he's got nothing to say. 
INT. LAB REFRIGERATION ROOM - NIGHT 
Will stands at the fringes of the room, watching MEN IN HAZMAT SUITS pull down SHELVES OF METAL CANISTERS LABELED ADV 
His work - destroyed. 
EXT. BACK LOT, BEHIND THE LAB - NIGHT 
Will climbs into his truck and pauses. He reaches into a jacket pocket and brings out a VIAL - IT'S THE VIAL of 112 HE 
USED IN THE PRESENTATION - THE ONLY REMAINING ONE. TAP AT THE WINDOW. Franklin's face appears. Will shoves the VIAL back into his pocket, rolls down the window. 
Â¢ FRANKLIN Show you something, boss? 
WILL I don't work here anymore, Franklin. 
FRANKLIN I just put down fifteen animals, Dr. Rodman. The least you could do is give me a moment of your time. Will's shoulders sag with exhaustion. It's been a long, devastating day. 
WILL of course. 
INT. PRIMATE LAB - NIGHT 
The cages are empty, the doors open. Will notes used SYRINGES on the table, filled body bags lined up on the floor. It's a creepy, horrible scene. 
FRANKLIN They're all gone. 
WILL I'm sorry, Franklin. Genuinely sorry... What's he got to do to get the hell out of there? Franklin ignores him, steps inside Bright Eyes' cage. He moves to the very back and pulls aside a blanket. At first Will doesn't understand what he's looking at. The lighting's dim and the thing's so small... But then IT MOVES AND WILL REALIZES HE'S LOOKING AT AN INFANT 
CHIMPANZEE. Will stares at it for a long moment, his brain overloaded. 
WILL (CONT'D) It's impossible. How could a full- term gestation go unnoticed? 
FRANKLIN They carry small. Must have been pregnant when they brought her in. Will tries to get his mind around the situation. 
WILL Who else knows about this? 
FRANKLIN No one. 
(BEAT) I'd bring him home, but my brother- in-law works for security. He'd rat me out in a second. That's when will realizes. 
WILL You want me to take him? 
FRANKLIN He's an orphan now. 
WILL I could be thrown in jail. He's a chimpanzee who's been exposed to a possibly dangerous drug. 
FRANKLIN You don't believe that. 
WILL Doesn't matter what I believe. 
FRANKLIN Just for a couple days. Until I can find a sanctuary. 
WILL That's not possible. 
FRANKLIN I heard you outside, fighting to keep them alive. 
WILL I was talking about the work, my 
RESEARCH - 
FRANKLIN she was just trying to protect him. 
WILL What?

DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. THE SKY - DAY 
A JETLINER descending in the hot, cerulean sky. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. KENNEDY INTERNATIONAL - AFTERNOON 
Marian, looking a little forlorn and out of sorts, stands out by the taxi area with her suitcase on a tote, looking around for a cab, unsure what to do. 
CURBSIDE - A FEW MINUTES LATER 
MISCHA, a somewhat dissolute-looking Russian cabbie in his thirties, roughhouses Marian's single piece of luggage into the dirty, cluttered trunk of his cab. 
INT. TAXI - DAY 
Marian is sitting in the back of the cab as Mischa opens the driver's side door and slams it shut, rattling Marian's nerves. 
MISCHA (brusquely) Where to? 
MARIAN Are you sure you got my bag in? 
MISCHA What do you think?  I left it on the curb?

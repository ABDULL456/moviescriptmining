Leonard pushes Teddy out of the basement. 
TEDDY I think you've got the wrong idea - 
Leonard GRABS Teddy. 
LEONARD Who was that? He's not the guy. He knew			* me.							 * 
TEDDY							    * Sure he did. He raped your wife and			    * fucked up your brain.						   * 
LEONARD							  * Bullshit.							* 
TEDDY His name's James F. Grantz, John G. Check		   * your tattoos.							 * 
LEONARD So what was he bringing the two hundred			* grand for?							    * 
TEDDY							    * What -							   * 
LEONARD							  * What was it for?							   * 
TEDDY A load of amphetamine I told him I had.

TEDDY (cont'd)						* Jimmy's your guy, Leonard. I just figured		   * we'd make some money on the side.				 * 
LEONARD							  * But how did he know me?						 * 
TEDDY							    * The Discount Inn, he deals out of there.		    * The guy at the front desk lets him know if anybody comes snooping around. He called Jimmy as soon as you took a picture of that dump.						   * 
LEONARD You're using me! 
Teddy looks at him, offended. 
TEDDY No! (beat) You get half.							 * 
Leonard THROWS him against the wall. 
LEONARD He knew about Sammy. Why would I tell him about Sammy?							  * 
TEDDY (chuckles) You tell everyone about Sammy. Everyone who'll listen. "Remember Sammy Jankis, remember Sammy Jankis". Great story. Gets better every time you tell it. So you lie to yourself to be happy. Nothing wrong with that - we all do. Who cares if there's a few little things you'd rather not remember? 
LEONARD What the fuck are you talking about?

TEDDY (theatrical shrug) I dunno... your wife surviving the assault... her not believing about your condition... the doubt tearing her up inside.., the insulin - 
LEONARD That's Sammy, not me! I told you about Sammy - 
TEDDY Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" - 
LEONARD Sammy let his wife kill herself! Sammy ended up in an institution - !				    * 
TEDDY Sammy was a con man. A faker. 
LEONARD I never said he was faking! I never said that! 
TEDDY You exposed him for what he was: a fraud.

LEONARD I was wrong! That's the whole point! Sammy's wife came to me and - 
TEDDY Sammy didn't have a wife. 
Leonard freezes, staring at Teddy. 
TEDDY (cont'd) It was your wife who had diabetes. 
Leonard thinks. 
175  INT. LEONARD'S APARTMENT - DAY <>		 175 
Leonard's Wife sitting on the edge of the bed. She feels a sharp pain, and turns to Leonard (just as we have seen before). 
LEONARD'S WIFE Gentle. 
Leonard has a syringe in his hand.

Leonard shakes his head, clearing his head of the image. 
LEONARD My wife wasn't diabetic.

95   INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT                                     95 
The lights are still dead. Maslow is with a team of Europols moving through the stairwell. He talks quietly. 
MIKA Ryan- I had to leave! 
MASLOW Good, stay clear. 
MIKA Do you have the map? 
MASLOW Not yet.   We're heading upstairs now. 
MIKA Where's Raizo

MASLOW He took off.   We think they went after him. 
He looks into the surrounding shadows unsure. 
96   EXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT                                         96 
Raizo parkours across the roofs, the Hanta Kirra close behind. 
Shuriken sizzle past; some missing, some lashing open whip cuts across his flesh. 
97   EXT. WINGED VICTORY ROUNDABOUT - NIGHT                        97 
Raizo pulls free the shuriken in his side. Drops them to the ground where they clatter back and forth like so much tossed change. He looks up at winged victory silhouetted against the moonlight. 
And suddenly the ninja are on him. 
Raizo blocks and parries. Counterattacks with a reverse cut - and throws himself sideways as a truck comes roaring down at him. 
The truck fills the screen with lights and horns and three tons of death. 
Raizo cartwheels over the hood, forcing the Scarred Ninja to leap the other way, and as he turns -- 
-- Raizo comes down on him, slashing his shoulder. 
98   EXT. WINGED VICTORY ROUNDABOUT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS           98 
The fight is now two one against one, and one of them is Takeshi. Their swords crash back and forth, sending sparks flying. 
Raizo is tired, already wounded by the shuriken... 
With a cry, he hurls a second Ninja back and spins to face Takeshi... 
Too late. Takeshi's blade gets under his guard.       Opens up Raizo's side. 
His sword is ripped free from his hand, rebounds off a speeding sedan and clatters to the ground thirty feet away. (CONTINUED) GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT    6/4/08    78. 98   CONTINUED:                                                   98 
Raizo stumbles backward. Life's blood dripping down and splattering on the concrete. 
Takeshi raises his sword high.       Smiles. 
TAKESHI This is the end for you, brother. 
Mika's car slashes across the width of the street screeching to a stop next to Raizo. The door snaps open. 
MIKA Raizo! 
Raizo gets into the car. Collapses into the seat, arms wrapped tight around the ugly wound in his side. She peels away before the others can stop her. 
Mika carves a path through the traffic, driving as fast as she can. Eager to get more miles between them and the ninjas. 
Raizo lets out a gasp as the car goes over a bump.        His shirt is drenched with his own blood. 
MIKA (CONT'D) What were you doing in the street?! 
RAIZO ...waiting for you... 
MIKA You have to go to a hospital. 
RAIZO No. Not a hospital.     Another place. 
The car speeds into the night. 
99   EXT. HERBALIST - NIGHT                                          99 
The sort of store where the owner lives above the shop. Mika pounds on the door as a LIGHT comes on in the floor above. A moment later, the door opens. 
HERBALIST What is it?   What -- 
He steps out of the way as Mika helps Raizo in, bloody and half-dead. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT    6/4/08   79.

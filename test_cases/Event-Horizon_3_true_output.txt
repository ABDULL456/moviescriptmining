PETERS We've got pressure. 
MILLER Clear and open on my mark. Three... two... one... mark. 
Peters inserts a zero-G drill into the panel beside the door. The door slowly opens... 
CUT TO: 
INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - WITH AIRLOCKS 
The immense corridor stretches away into darkness in both directions. Distantly spaced windows manifest as remote pools of blue light amidst endless black, adding to the vast sense of scale. 
The light from their dual spotlights on the team's helmets reflects off tiny ice crystals of frozen atmosphere. They are ants in a tomb built for giants. 
PETERS Jesus its huge. 
MILLER Ice crystals everywhere. This place is a deep freeze. 
WEIR (O.S.) (radio) You're in the central corridor. It connects the personnel areas to Engineering. 
MILLER Peters and I will search the forward decks. Justin, take Engineering. No hot-dogging, not on this one, alright? 
JUSTIN Not a chance, sir. 
INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS 
The group separates. Justin kicks off from the wall, shoots down the corridor at immense speed. 
INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - WITH AIRLOCKS 
Miller and Peters move in the opposite direction. They use magnetic plates on their boots and gloves to cling to the walls as they slowly make their way down the dark shaft. Their journey seems endless. The darkness almost seems a living thing as it surrounds them. 
INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS 
Miller spots something at a coupling, where two sections of the corridor join... 
MILLER Dr. Weir, what's this? 
Miller indicates a box nestled against the coupling. The universal symbol for explosives is on the cover. 
PETERS (ahead at the next coupling) Here's another one. They're all over the place. 
WEIR (O.S.) (radio) They're explosive charges. 
MILLER I can see that, what're they for? 
INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE 
WEIR In an emergency, the charges detonate in series, destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship. That way, if the gravity drive malfunctions, the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat. 
INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS 
Peters and Miller keep moving. 
PETERS That means they didn't abandon ship. 
MILLER So where are they? Starck, any luck with the bio-scan? 
INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE 
STARCK I'm running diagnostics now, Skipper... Nothing's wrong with the sensor pack, I'm still getting trace life readings, all over the ship. 
INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS 
Miller and Peters unconsciously look around. Sweat beads their faces. 
PETERS There's no one in the corridor but us. 
STARCK (O.S.) (radio) Not according to the computer. 
MILLER Peters is right, no one's here. 
PETERS I don't know, this place is really dark, I can't see a thing... 
She starts to wave her searchlight around wildly. 
MILLER (calming her down) Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay. Let's finish the sweep. 
WEIR (O.S.) (radio) Captain Miller, the foredecks are just ahead. 
PETERS I can see the hatch. 
MILLER Starck, you still showing those readings? 
STARCK (O.S.) (radio) That's an affirmative. 
MILLER (to Peters) Keep your eyes open. 
She nods as he reaches for the hatch... 
INT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY 
The hatch opens, allowing Peters and Miller entrance into the forward decks. These areas were intended for human habitation, and seem similar in design to the Lewis and Clark, only larger. 
Gravity couches line both walls, eighteen in all. Empty. 
PETERS We found the gravity couches.

KHAN No! 
JOACHIM Sir, we must! (desperate urging) We must repair the damage. Enterprise will wait; she's not going anywhere. 
Khan calms as the other holds him; he breathes deeper. 
101   EXT. SPACE                                                 101 
Reliant turns away. 
102   ENTERPRISE BRIDGE                                          102 
They watch on screen as Reliant hauls off. 
SULU (breathless) Sir, you did it. 
KIRK (enraged) I did nothing -- except get caught with my britches down. I must be senile. Mr. Saavik, you just keep right on quoting regulations. Meantime, let's find out what the hell is going on and see how bad we've been -- 
The turbo doors whoosh open as Kirk reaches them. Scotty stands there, tears streaming down his face; he holds the body of Midshipman Preston. Both of them are covered in blood. He sways into Kirk's arms as the others rush forward. 
103   EXT. SPACE                                                 103 
The Enterprise, motionless, scars of battle showing. 
104   INT. ENGINE ROOM                                           104 
The CREW, wearing respirators amid the motionless ball of gas, work frantically at a dozen jobs, trying to put things aright, splicing wires, etc. Some TRAINEES who panicked are back. 
105   FEATURE THE CREW CHIEF                                     105 
making a final adjustment. 
CREW CHIEF Hit your blowers! 
A TURBO WHINES and a great wind of suction pulls the gas towards appropriate vents. The Crew Chief watches, then yanks off his respirator; wipes his brow. 
106   INT. SICK BAY                                              106 
MANY CASUALTIES IN EVIDENCE. Kirk enters and LEADS CAMERA THROUGH them; he has a word or two for men he doesn't know by name. Kirk leads us to the operating theatre, where Bones works over Preston. Scotty stands by, his lips trembling. Preston opens his eyes, sees Scotty and Kirk. 
PRESTON (faint) Is the word given? 
KIRK (soft) The word is given: warp speed. 
PRESTON (almost smiles) Aye... 
He dies. Pause. Scotty looks across the body at Kirk. 
SCOTTY WHY? 
KIRK (looks at Preston) He wants to kill me for passing sentence on him 14 years ago -- and he doesn't care who stands between him and his vengeance. 
BONES Scotty, I'm sorry... 
SCOTTY He stayed at his post. When the trainees ran, he stayed. 
KIRK If he hadn't, we'd be space by now. 
SPOCK'S VOICE Admiral, this is Spock. 
Kirk hits a wall intercom -- 
KIRK Yes, Spock. 
SPOCK'S VOICE Engine room reports auxiliary power restored. We can proceed at impulse power. 
KIRK (thinks) Best speed to Regula I. Kirk out. Scotty, I've got to ask: Any chance of getting the mains back on the line? 
SCOTTY I dinna think so, sir, but you'll have my best -- 
With an effort, he gets to his feet -- 
SCOTTY (continuing) Thanks -- I know you tried, Doctor... 
Squeezes his shoulder and limps off -- We NOW HEAR the sound of impulse power taking effect. 
KIRK Are you all right? 
Bones shrugs unhappily, looks at Preston. 
BONES Doctors lose patients sometimes. Damn. I'm still in the dark: How'd he know about Genesis? 
KIRK At the moment that question takes a back seat to preventing him from laying his hands on it. You said it yourself; we're talking about a bang that would re-arrange the universe... 
BONES There may still be time... you gave as good as you got.

DEMIDOV (CONT'D) Except that you don't! 
Suddenly Demidov pistol whips the man across the face! 
Blood explodes from THICK NECK's nose.     He falls down to one knee, clutching his face in pain. 
Scarface looks on in fear. Demidov calms himself almost as quickly as he lost his temper. He drops the gun on the carpet and steps back in disgust. 
DEMIDOV (CONT'D) If you did your job properly, I wouldn't have to get my hands dirty, you piece of shit. 
He turns and walks into the bathroom to wash his hands. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CIPRIANI HOTEL - DAY 
Heels clicking on the cobblestones, Cara strides quickly along the Palazzo Vendramin en route to the Cipriani. She checks her watch. Then walks faster. 
She passes a smallish transporto via cargo (supply boat) floating in the lagoon beside the Palazzo. 
Cara approaches the poolside hotel restaurant. 
INT. CIPRIANI HOTEL - DAY 
From a second story SUITE of rooms, The ENGLISHMAN peers through the curtains. He sees Cara seat herself at a TABLE between the pool and the lagoon. 
His eyes settle on the transporto. Workers step on and off, carrying fresh linens into the hotel. 
He leaves the window. 
INT. TRANSPORTO - DAY 
There is a small cabin on the deck. 
Inside the cabin, Ackerman, Goyal, a videographer, a signals surveillance officer and a coordinating tactics officer huddle. 
Ackerman stares out the tinted window. 
ACKERMAN'S POV - he can just see Cara sitting at the table. 
EXT. CIPRIANI HOTEL, POOLSIDE RESTAURANT - DAY 
Fanning herself with a newspaper, Cara discreetly evaluates the men in her sight lines. Venetian civic leaders chatting by the bar, tourists reading maps... 
Over her sunglasses she catches sight of a pair of YOUNG LOVERS drunk in each other's grasp in the pool. 
She turns away. 
INT. TRANSPORTO - DAY 
Squinting, Ackerman evaluates his placements. 
- A WAITER, idling at his bussing station, his eyes roaming the palazzo. 
- A VAPORETTO CAPTAIN, who quietly turns away requests for a ride into St. Marks Square, his finger to his ear. 
- An OLDER COUPLE sitting a few seats away from Cara. 
And an AGENTE DI POLIZIA (police patrolman) loud and jovial, joking with passersby, while quietly checking his earpiece. 
He speaks into the air. 
AGENTE DI POLIZIA (V.O.) (from the speakers) Eh, we do not know any further...characteristics? 
ACKERMAN (pressing a button) You know what we know. 
EXT. CIPRIANI HOTEL, POOLSIDE RESTAURANT - DAY 
The VIDEO CAMERA swivels to follow a MAN, elegantly dressed, with trim hair who swiftly approaches Cara's table... 
IN THE TRANSPORTO 
Standing up, Ackerman holds his hand up. 
ACKERMAN (into the speaker) Hold...wait for my signal... 
AT THE RESTAURANT 
Cara glances up from her menu as she senses the elegant man approaching. 
The WAITER walks quickly toward Cara's table...

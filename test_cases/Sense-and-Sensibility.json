{"train": "\"SENSE AND SENSIBILITY\" \nScreenplay by \nEmma Thompson \nBased on the novel by \nJane Austen \nEXT. OPEN ROADS - NIGHT - TITLE SEQUENCE \nA series of traveling shots. A well-dressed, pompous-looking individual (JOHN DASHWOOD, 35) is making an urgent journey on horseback. He looks anxious. \nEXT. NORLAND PARK - ENGLAND - MARCH 1800 - NIGHT \nSilence. Norland Park, a large country house built in the early part of the eighteenth century, lies in the moonlit parkland. \nINT. NORLAND PARK - MR DASHWOOD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nIn the dim light shed by candles we see a bed in which a MAN (MR DASHWOOD, 52) lies his skin waxy, his breathing laboured. Around him two silhouettes move and murmur, their clothing susurrating in the deathly hush. DOCTORS. A WOMAN (MRS DASHWOOD, 50) sits by his side, holding his hand, her eyes never leaving his face. \nMR DASHWOOD (urgent) Is John not yet arrived? \nMRS DASHWOOD We expect him at any moment, dearest. \nMR DASHWOOD looks anguished. \nMR DASHWOOD The girls--I have left so little. \nMRS DASHWOOD Shh, hush, Henry. \nMR DASHWOOD Elinor will try to look after you all, but make sure she finds a good husband. The men are such noodles hereabouts, little wonder none has pleased her. \nThey smile at each other. MRS DASHWOOD is just managing to conceal her fear and grief \nMRS DASHWOOD But Marianne is sure to find her storybook hero. \nMR DASHWOOD A romantic poet with flashing eyes and empty pockets? \nMRS DASHWOOD As long as she loves him, whoever he is. \nMR DASHWOOD Margaret will go to sea and become a pirate so we need not concern ourselves with her. \nMRS DASHWOOD tries to laugh but it emerges as a sob. An older MANSERVANT (THOMAS) now enters, anxiety written on every feature. \nTHOMAS Your son is arrived from London, sir. \nMR DASHWOOD squeezes his wife's hand. \nMR DASHWOOD Let me speak to John alone. \nShe nods quickly and he smiles at her with infinite tenderness. \nMR DASHWOOD Ah, my dear. How happy you have made me. \nMRS DASHWOOD makes a superhuman effort and smiles back. She allows THOMAS to help her out. She passes JOHN DASHWOOD as he enters, presses his hand, but cannot speak. JOHN takes her place by the bed. \nJOHN Father... \nMR DASHWOOD summons his last ounces of energy and starts to whisper with desperate intensity. \nMR DASHWOOD John you will find out soon enough from my will that the estate of Norland was left to me in such a way as prevents me from dividing it between my families. \nJOHN blinks. He cannot quite take it in. \nJOHN Calm yourself, Father. This is not good for you. \nBut MR DASHWOOD continues with even greater determination. \nMR DASHWOOD Norland in its entirety is therefore yours by law and I am happy for you and Fanny. \nJOHN looks torn between genuine distress and unexpected delight. \nMR DASHWOOD But your stepmother my wife and daughters are left with only five hundred pounds a year, barely enough to live on and nothing for the girls' dowries. You must help them. \nJOHN's face is a picture of conflicting emotions. Behind them is the ominous rustling of parchments. \nJOHN Of course \nMR DASHWOOD You must promise to do this. \nA brief moment of sincerity overcomes JOHN's natural hypocrisy. \nJOHN I promise, Father, I promise. \nMR DASHWOOD seems relieved. Suddenly his breathing changes. JOHN looks alarmed. He rises and we hear him going to find the DOCTOR. \nJOHN Come! Come quickly! \nBut it is we who share the dying man's last words. \nMR DASHWOOD Help them. \nEXT. JOHN AND FANNY'S TOWN HOUSE - LONDON - DAY \nCLOSE on ELINOR as she ponders the truth of this statement. \nINT. JOHN AND FANNY'S CARRIAGE - DAY \nJOHN and FANNY joggle on. \nJOHN Twenty pounds now and then will amply discharge my promise, you are quite right. \nFANNY Indeed. Although to say the truth, I am convinced within myself that your father had no idea of your giving them money. \nJOHN They will have five hundred a year amongst them as it is-- \nFANNY --and what on earth can four women want for more than that? Their housekeeping will be nothing at all they will have no carriage, no horses, hardly any servants and will keep no company. Only conceive how comfortable they will be! \nINT. NORLAND PARK - SERVANTS' HALL - DAY \nThe large contingent of SERVANTS who staff Norland Park are gathered in gloomy silence as ELINOR addresses them. \nELINOR As you know, we are looking for a new home. When we leave we shall be able to retain only Thomas and Betsy. \nCAM holds on THOMAS and BETSY, a capable woman. \nELINOR We are very sorry to have to leave you all. But we are certain you will find the new Mrs Dashwood a fair and generous mistress. \nEXT. NORLAND PARK. DRIVE - DAY \nJOHN and FANNY's carriage approaches Norland. \nFANNY (V.O.) They will be much more able to give you something. \nINT. JOHN AND FANNY'S CARRIAGE - DAY \nJOHN and FANNY are about to get out. \nJOHN So we are agreed. No money but the occasional gift of game and fish in season will be very welcome. \nFANNY Your father would be proud of you. \nINT. NORLAND PARK - DINING ROOM - EARLY EVE \nThe entire family, with the exception of MARGARET, is present. BETSY is serving food in an atmosphere of stiff silence. Cutlery clinks. JOHN chews loudly. MARIANNE is rigid with resentment. MRS DASHWOOD maintains a cool, removed dignity. ELINOR tries to play hostess. \nELINOR How is Mrs Ferrars? \nFANNY My mother is always in excellent health, thank you. My brother Robert is in town with her this season and quite the most popular bachelor in London! He has his own barouche. \nIn the brief silence which follows this, FANNY surreptitiously checks the hallmark on her butterknife. \nELINOR You have two brothers, have you not? \nFANNY Indeed, yes. Edward is the eldest Mamma quite depends upon him. He is traveling up from Plymouth shortly and will break his journey here. \nMRS DASHWOOD looks at ELINOR pointedly. JOHN notices. \nJOHN (to MRS DASHWOOD) If that is agreeable to you, of course. \nMRS DASHWOOD My dear John this is your home now. \nFANNY looks about, barely able to conceal her satisfaction. \nINT. NORLAND PARK - ELINOR'S BEDROOM - DAY \nELINOR is sitting with a little pile of parcels. She puts a shawl into some paper and ties it with ribbon as MARIANNE thunders in, looking mutinous. \nMARIANNE Fanny wishes to know where the key for the silver cabinet is kept. \nELINOR Betsy has it, I think. What does Fanny want with the silver? \nMARIANNE I can only presume she wants to count it. What are you doing? \nELINOR Presents for the servants. Have you seen Margaret? I am worried about her. She has taken to hiding in the oddest places. \nMARIANNE Fortunate girl. At least she can escape Fanny, which is more than any of us is able. \nELINOR You do your best. You have not said a word to her for a week. \nMARIANNE (truculently) I have! I have said 'yes' and 'no'. \nINT. NORLAND PARK - BREAKFAST ROOM - DAY \nFANNY, MRS DASHWOOD, ELINOR and JOHN are at breakfast. MARIANNE enters. ELINOR catches her eye and indicates FANNY with a slight motion of her head. MARIANNE makes a face. \nMARIANNE (very polite) Good morning, Fanny. \nFANNY is rather startled. \nFANNY Good morning, Marianne. \nELINOR is relieved. \nMARIANNE (to Fanny) How did you find the silver? Is it all genuine? \nELINOR rushes in before MARIANNE gets any further. \nELINOR Pray, when may we expect the pleasure of your brother's company? \nELINOR (V.O.) Won't you come out, dearest? We haven't seen you all day. Mamma is very concerned. \nMore silence. EDWARD thinks hard. He makes a decision. \nINT. NORLAND PARK - LIBRARY - DAY \nEDWARD walks in loudly. \nEDWARD Oh, Miss Dashwood! Excuse me I was wondering do you by any chance have such a thing as a reliable atlas? \nELINOR looks up at him in astonishment. \nELINOR I believe so. \nEDWARD Excellent. I wish to check the position of the Nile. \nEDWARD appears to be utterly sincere. \nEDWARD My sister says it is in South America. \nFrom under the table we hear a snort. ELINOR looks at him in realisation. \nELINOR Oh! No, no indeed. She is quite wrong. For I believe it is in--in Belgium. \nEDWARD Belgium? Surely not. You must be thinking of the Volga. \nMARGARET (from under the table) The Volga? \nELINOR Of course. The Volga, which, as you know, starts in... \nEDWARD Vladivostok, and ends in... \nELINOR St Albans. \nEDWARD Indeed. Where the coffee beans come from. \nThey are having such a good time that it is rather a pity the game is stopped by the appearance from under the table of MARGARET who reveals herself to be a disheveled girl of eleven. She hauls the atlas up and plonks it in front of EDWARD. \nMARGARET The source of the Nile is in Abyssinia. \nEDWARD Is it? Good heavens. How do you do. Edward Ferrars. \nMARGARET Margaret Dashwood. \nEDWARD shakes MARGARET's hand solemnly and looks over her head at ELINOR. They smile at each other, a connection made. \nINT. NORLAND PARK - DRAWING ROOM - ANOTHER DAY \nJOHN is reading a newspaper. MRS DASHWOOD sits across from FANNY, who thumbs through a fashion-plate magazine. ELINOR is at a desk by the window writing a letter we see the words 'of course we should like to leave as soon as possible'. Suddenly she hears a commotion outside. MARGARET runs past the window brandishing a stick. EDWARD follows, and proceeds to teach her the first principles of sword-fighting. They feint and parry, EDWARD serious and without a hint of condescension, MARGARET concentrating furiously. EDWARD suddenly turns, as though feeling ELINOR's gaze. She smiles but looks away quickly. \nINT. NORLAND PARK - VELVET ROOM - ANOTHER DAY \nEDWARD comes into the doorway and sees ELINOR who is listening to MARIANNE playing a concerto. ELINOR stands in a graceful, rather sad attitude, her back to us. Suddenly she senses EDWARD behind her and turns. He is about to turn away, embarrassed to have been caught admiring her, when he sees she has been weeping. Hastily she tries to dry her eyes. He comes forward and offers her a handkerchief, which she takes with a grateful smile. We notice his monogram in the corner: ECF. \nELINOR (apologetic) That was my father's favourite. \nEDWARD nods kindly. \nELINOR Thank you so much for your help with Margaret, Mr Ferrars. She is a changed girl since your arrival. \nEDWARD Not at all. I enjoy her company. \nELINOR Has she shown you her tree-house? \nEDWARD Not yet. Would you do me the honour, Miss Dashwood? It is very fine out. \nELINOR With pleasure. \nThey start to walk out of shot, still talking. \nELINOR Margaret has always wanted to travel. \nEDWARD I know. She is heading an expedition to China shortly. I am to go as her servant but only on the understanding that I will be very badly treated. \nELINOR What will your duties be? \nEDWARD Sword-fighting, administering rum and swabbing. \nELINOR Ah. \nCAM tilts up to find MRS DASHWOOD on the middle landing of the staircase, smiling down at them. CAM tilts up yet further to find FANNY on the landing above, watching EDWARD and ELINOR with a face like a prune. \nEXT. NORLAND PARK - GARDENS - DAY \nEDWARD and ELINOR are still talking as they walk arm in arm in the late afternoon sun. \nEDWARD All I want--all I have ever wanted is the quiet of a private life but my mother is determined to see me distinguished. \nELINOR As? \nEDWARD She hardly knows. Any fine figure will suit a great orator, a leading politician, even a barrister would serve, but only on the condition that I drive my own barouche and dine in the first circles. \nHis tone is light but there is an underlying bitterness to it. \nELINOR And what do you wish for? \nEDWARD Excuse me, Miss Dashwood. \nFANNY drags EDWARD off, leaving ELINOR to gaze sadly after them. \nINT. THE LADIES' CARRIAGE - OPEN ROAD - RAIN - EVE \nThe DASHWOODS are on their way. The mood is very sombre. \nMARGARET Edward promised he would bring the atlas to Barton for me. \nMARIANNE looks at ELINOR, pleased. \nMARIANNE Did he? Well, I will wager he will do so in less than a fortnight! \nMRS DASHWOOD looks at ELINOR with satisfaction. \nEXT. THE LADIES' CARRIAGE - OPEN ROAD - EVE \nThe carriage rolls on. \nMARGARET (V.O.) Are we there yet? \nEXT. ROAD TO AND FROM BARTON COTTAGE - DAY \nIn comparison to Norland, Barton Cottage has the air of a damp shoebox. it sits low and bleak in the grey lonely countryside. \nFrom one side we can see the DASHWOODS' carriage drawing up at the gate. From the other, a much grander vehicle, from which loud whooping can be heard, is approaching. \nEXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN PATH - DAY \nAs the exhausted DASHWOODS alight, they converge with a ruddy- complexioned MAN in a redingote (SIR JOHN MIDDLETON) and a rotund, equally roseate LADY (MRS JENNINGS) who have fallen over each other in their haste to get out of their carriage. \nMRS DASHWOOD Sir John! \nSIR JOHN clasps her hands and starts to help her up the path, followed by ELINOR, MARIANNE and MARGARET, who is clearly fascinated by his bouncy companion. \nSIR JOHN Dear ladies, dear ladies, upon my word, here you are, here you are, here you are! \nMRS DASHWOOD Sir John, your extraordinary kindness-- \nSIR JOHN Oh, none of that, hush, please, none of that, but here is my dear mamma- in-law Mrs Jennings. \nMRS JENNINGS Was the journey tolerable, you poor souls? \nSIR JOHN Why did you not come up to the Park first and take your ease? We saw you pass--Like many people who live rather lonely lives together. \nSIR JOHN and MRS JENNINGS talk incessantly, interrupt each other all the time and never listen. \nMRS JENNINGS --but I would not wait for you to come to us, I made John call for the carriage-- \nSIR JOHN She would not wait, you know. \nMRS JENNINGS --as we get so little company. \nThey reach the front door and BETSY's smiling welcome. In the confusion of milling people and THOMAS carrying the lighter luggage, MARIANNE contrives to slip into the house alone. We follow her but hear the conversation continuing in V.O. MARIANNE looks about the parlour, where a dismal fire is smoking. She starts up the stairs, expressionless. \nMRS JENNINGS (V.O.) But I feel as if I know you already-- delightful creatures! \nSIR JOHN (V.O.) Delightful! And you know you are to dine at Barton Park every day. \nMRS DASHWOOD (V.O.) Oh, but dear Sir John, we cannot-- \nSIR JOHN (V.O.) Oh, no no no no no no no, I shall not brook refusals. I am quite deaf to 'em, you know-- \nMRS JENNINGS (V.O.) --deaf-- \nMARIANNE enters a small bedroom. She sits on the bed. Then she goes to the window and opens it. Voices float up. \nSIR JOHN (V.O.) But I insist! \nELINOR (V.O.) Let us only settle in for a few days, Sir John, and thank you-- \nSIR JOHN (V.O.) Oh, no thankings, no, please, can't bear 'em, embarrassing, you know-- \nMARIANNE closes the window and crosses the corridor to another bed room--similarly stark. She sighs and turns back down the stairs. \nSIR JOHN (V.O.) We will send game and fruit as a matter of course-- \nMRS JENNINGS (V.O.) --fruit and game-- \nSIR JOHN (V.O.) --and the carriage is at your beck and call-- \nMARIANNE joins the group, who are now in the parlour. \nMRS JENNINGS --call--and here is Miss Marianne! \nSIR JOHN Where did you disappear to? \nMRS JENNINGS I declare you are the loveliest girl I ever set eyes on! Cannot you get them married, Mrs Dashwood? You must not leave it too long! \nSIR JOHN But, alas, there are no smart young men hereabouts to woo them-- \nMRS JENNINGS --not a beau for miles! \nThe strain of exhibiting joy and gratitude is beginning to tell on MRS DASHWOOD who is sagging visibly. \nMRS JENNINGS Give us a clue, Miss Dashwood--is he in uniform? \nELINOR starts to change the subject, but MARGARET interrupts her. \nMARGARET He has no profession! \nSIR JOHN and MRS JENNINGS turn on her with screams of delight. ELINOR, MARIANNE and MRS DASHWOOD look at each other helplessly. \nSIR JOHN No profession! A gentleman, then! \nMARIANNE (with daggers) Margaret, you know perfectly well there is no such person. \nMARGARET There is! There is! And his name begins with an F! \nELINOR looks hard at her plate. \nMRS DASHWOOD Margaret! \nMRS DASHWOOD is appalled at her youngest's relish for such a vulgar game. SIR JOHN and MRS JENNINGS are cock-a-hoop. \nSIR JOHN F indeed! A very promising letter. Let me--F, F, Fo, Fa... Upon my word, but I cannot think of a single name beginning with F-- \nMRS JENNINGS Forrest? Foster? Frost? Foggarty? \nMARIANNE suddenly stands up. SIR JOHN and MRS JENNINGS are so surprised they stop talking. Everyone stares at MARIANNE. \nMARIANNE (controlled fury) Sir John, might I play your pianoforte? \nSIR JOHN Of course, yes--my goodness. We do not stand on ceremony here, my dear. \nFor once, ELINOR is grateful for her sister's rudeness as everyone rises and follows MARIANNE out. \nEXT. BARTON PARK - FRONT STEPS - EVE \nA soldierly MAN of about forty (COLONEL BRANDON) is dismounting from his horse. From within we hear MARIANNE's song begin. His head snaps up to the windows. An expression of pained surprise comes into his melancholy, brooding eyes. \nINT. BARTON PARK - MUSIC ROOM - EVE \nEveryone watches MARIANNE as she plays and sings. Behind them we see BRANDON entering. But he stays in the shadow of the door and no one notices him. CLOSE on his face. He gazes at MARIANNE with an unfathomable look of grief and longing. He breathes in deeply. Suddenly, ELINOR feels his presence and looks around at him. After a few moments, she turns back, slightly puzzled. The song finishes. Everyone claps. The MAN ventures out into the light and SIR JOHN springs from his seat. \nSIR JOHN Brandon! Where have you been? Come, come and meet our beautiful new neighbours! \nMRS JENNINGS What a pity you are late, Colonel! You have missed the most delightful singing! \nBRANDON bows to the company and smiles slightly. \nCOLONEL BRANDON A great pity, indeed. \nELINOR looks at him, even more puzzled. \nSIR JOHN Mrs Dashwood, may I present my dear friend Colonel Brandon? We served together in the East Indies and I assure you there is no better fellow on earth-- \nMARGARET Have you really been to the East Indies, Colonel? \nCOLONEL BRANDON I have. \nMARGARET What is it like? \nMARGARET is quivering with fascination. \nSIR JOHN Like? Hot. \nBut COLONEL BRANDON knows what MARGARET wants to hear. \nCOLONEL BRANDON (mysteriously) The air is full of spices. \nMARGARET smiles with satisfaction. \nSIR JOHN Come, Miss Dashwood--it is your turn to entertain us! \nELINOR Oh no, Sir John, I do not-- \nSIR JOHN --and I think we can all guess what key you will sing in! \nSIR JOHN and MRS JENNINGS are bursting with their new joke. \nSIR JOHN/MRS JENNINGS F major! \nThey fall about. \nINT. SIR JOHN'S CARRIAGE - NIGHT \nThe DASHWOODS are returning home. A row is in progress. \nMARIANNE (to Margaret) As for you, you have no right, no right at all, to parade your ignorant assumptions-- \nMARGARET They are not assumptions. You told me. \nELINOR stares at MARIANNE. MARIANNE colours and attacks MARGARET again. \nMARIANNE I told you nothing-- \nMARGARET They'll meet him when he comes, anyway. \nMARIANNE That is not the point. You do not speak of such things before strangers-- \nBRANDON looks at MRS JENNINGS warningly but she ignores him. \nMRS JENNINGS I'll trow you know quite as many melancholy tunes as Miss Marianne! \nHer tone is so knowing that MARIANNE frowns uncomfortably. \nMRS JENNINGS Come! Let us see you both side by side! \nMARIANNE rises impatiently. \nMARIANNE I do not know any duets. Forgive me, Colonel. \nShe moves away. MRS JENNINGS chuckles. \nINT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - LATE AFTERNOON \nThe DASHWOODS returning. MARIANNE is taking her bonnet off so furiously that she simply gets the knot tighter and tighter. Despite them selves, ELINOR and MRS DASHWOOD are amused. \nMARIANNE Oh! Are we never to have a moment's peace? The rent here may be low but I think we have it on very hard terms. \nELINOR Mrs Jennings is a wealthy woman with a married daughter--she has nothing to do but marry off everyone else's. \nBETSY pokes her head out from the dining room. \nBETSY There's a parcel arrived for you, Miss Dashwood! \nMARGARET A parcel! \nThey all crowd into the dining room to find a large package on the table, which MARGARET is permitted to open. In the meantime ELINOR comes to the rescue with the bonnet and MARIANNE stands shifting like a spirited mare as ELINOR patiently unravels the knot. \nMARIANNE It is too ridiculous! When is a man to be safe from such wit if age and infirmity do not protect him? \nELINOR Infirmity! \nMRS DASHWOOD If Colonel Brandon is infirm, then I am at death's door. \nELINOR It is a miracle your life has extended this far... \nMARIANNE Did you not hear him complain of a rheumatism in his shoulder? \nELINOR A slight ache' I believe was his phrase... \nMARIANNE smiles and ELINOR laughs at her. Then MARGARET opens the parcel to reveal--her atlas. The atmosphere alters immediately as MRS DASHWOOD and MARIANNE look at ELINOR in consternation. \nMARGARET But Edward said he would bring it himself. \nThere is a letter on top of the atlas. CLOSE on the address 'To the Dashwoods'. MRS DASHWOOD picks it up, looks at ELINOR, and opens \nMRS DASHWOOD 'Dear Mrs Dashwood, Miss Dashwood, Miss Marianne and Captain Margaret-- it gives me great pleasure to restore this atlas to its rightful owner. Alas, business in London does not permit me to accompany it, although this is likely to hurt me far more than it hurts you. For the present my memories of your kindness must be enough to sustain me, and I remain your devoted servant always. E. C. Ferrars.' \nA silence greets this brief epistle. ELINOR struggles to contain her bitter disappointment. \nMARGARET But why hasn't he come? \nMRS DASHWOOD He says he is busy, dear. \nMARGARET He said he'd come. \nMARGARET is genuinely upset. ELINOR quietly hangs up MARIANNE's bonnet. \nMARGARET Why hasn't he come? \nMRS DASHWOOD looks beseechingly at MARIANNE, who nods and grasps MARGARET's hand. \nMARIANNE I am taking you for a walk. \nMARGARET No! I've been a walk. \nMARIANNE You need another. \nMARGARET It is going to rain. \nMARIANNE shoves her bonnet back on and drags MARGARET out. \nMARIANNE It is not going to rain. \nMARGARET You always say that and then it always does. \nWe hear the front door slam behind them. There is a short silence. \nMRS DASHWOOD I fear Mrs Jennings is a bad influence. \nShe approaches ELINOR. \nMRS DASHWOOD You must miss him, Elinor. \nELINOR looks very directly at her mother. \nELINOR We are not engaged, Mamma. \nMRS DASHWOOD But he loves you, dearest, of that I am certain. \nELINOR looks down. She speaks slowly, choosing her words with care. \nELINOR I am by no means assured of his regard for me. \nMARIANNE Do not be alarmed, Mamma. \nThe STRANGER deposits MARIANNE on the sofa. They look straight into each other's eyes. Electric. \nTHE STRANGER I can assure you it is not serious. I took the liberty of feeling the bone and it is perfectly sound. \nELINOR raises her eyebrows at MARIANNE, who blushes to her roots. \nMRS DASHWOOD Sir, I cannot even begin to thank you. \nTHE STRANGER Please do not think of it. I'm honoured of be of service. \nMRS DASHWOOD Will you not be seated? \nTHE STRANGER Pray excuse me--I have no desire to leave a water mark! But permit me to call tomorrow afternoon and inquire after the patient? \nMRS DASHWOOD We shall look forward to it! \nHe turns to MARIANNE and smiles. She smiles back gloriously. He bows, and sweeps out of the room. \nMARIANNE (hissing) His name! His name! \nMRS DASHWOOD silences her with a gesture and follows him out with all the solicitous charm she can command while MARGARET pokes her head around the door to watch. ELINOR is removing MARIANNE's boot and trying not to laugh at her. \nEXT. BARTON COTTAGE - FRONT DOOR - DAY \nMRS DASHWOOD calls out after him. \nMRS DASHWOOD Please tell us to whom we are so much obliged? \nThe STRANGER mounts Bedivere and turns to her. \nTHE STRANGER John Willoughby of Allenham--your servant, ma'am! \nAnd he gallops off into the mist--we almost expect Bedivere to sprout wings. CLOSE on MRS DASHWOOD's excited expression. \nINT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY \nMRS DASHWOOD runs back into the parlour, jittering with excitement and anxiety. \nMARIANNE Mr John Willoughby of Allenham! \nMRS DASHWOOD What an impressive gentleman! \nMARIANNE He lifted me as if I weighed no more than a dried leaf! \nELINOR Is he human? \nMARIANNE hits ELINOR. MRS DASHWOOD tends to her ankle. \nMRS DASHWOOD Tell me if I hurt you. \nELINOR (regarding Marianne's ecstatic expression) She feels no pain, Mamma. Margaret, ask Betsy to make up a cold compress, please. \nMARGARET (leaving reluctantly) Did you see him? He expressed himself well, did he not? \nMRS DASHWOOD With great decorum and honour. \nMARIANNE And spirit and wit and feeling. \nELINOR And economy--ten words at most. \nFrom below stairs we can hear MARGARET wailing Wait for me! \nMARIANNE And he is to come tomorrow! \nELINOR You must change, Marianne--you will catch a cold. \nMARIANNE What care I for colds when there is such a man? \nELINOR You will care very much when your nose swells up. \nMARIANNE You are right. Help me, Elinor. \nMARGARET comes back with the bandages. \nMARGARET What has happened? \nELINOR We have decided to give you to the Gypsies. \nELINOR and MARIANNE go upstairs. MARGARET whispers to MRS DASHWOOD. \nMARGARET Will they be married before Edward and Elinor, do you think, Mamma? \nMRS DASHWOOD Margaret, you are worse than Mrs Jennings. \nEXT. BARTON COTTAGE - MORNING \nThe rain has cleared. SIR JOHN's horse munches grass contentedly by the side of the road. \nSIR JOHN (V.O.) Mr Willoughby is well worth catching, Miss Dashwood--Miss Marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself! \nINT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - MORNING \nThe DASHWOODS are having a frustrating time winkling information about WILLOUGHBY out of SIR JOHN, who is in turn only anxious to protect BRANDON's interest. MARIANNE has her bandaged foot up on the sofa and is fast losing patience. \nELINOR I will put these in water. \nMRS DASHWOOD Our gratitude, Mr Willoughby, is beyond expression-- \nWILLOUGHBY But it is I who am grateful. I have often passed this cottage and grieved for its lonely state--and then the first news I had from Lady Allen when I arrived was that it was taken. I felt a peculiar interest in the event which nothing can account for but my present delight in meeting you. \nHe is merry, spirited, voluble--a breath of fresh air. ELINOR brings back WILLOUGHBY's flowers and places them next to BRANDON's on the side table. \nMRS DASHWOOD Pray sit down, Mr Willoughby. \nShe indicates a chair but WILLOUGHBY sees a book lying on MARIANNE's footstool, picks it up and--to her great delight-- sits down on the stool at her feet. \nWILLOUGHBY Who is reading Shakespeare's sonnets? \nEveryone answers at once. \nMARIANNE/ELINOR/MRS DASHWOOD I am. / We all are. / Marianne. \nMRS DASHWOOD Marianne has been reading them out to us. \nWILLOUGHBY Which are your favourites? \nIt is a general question but MARIANNE gaily commandeers it. \nMARIANNE Without a doubt, mine is 116. \nWILLOUGHBY Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments. Love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds, Or bends with the remover to remove--then how does it go? \nMARIANNE '0, no! it is an ever-fixed mark.' \nWILLOUGHBY joins in the line halfway through and continues. ELINOR and MRS DASHWOOD exchange glances. Clearly, their contribution to this conversation will be minimal. \nWILLOUGHBY 'That looks on storms'--or is it tempests? Let me find it. \nWILLOUGHBY gets out a tiny leatherbound book. \nWILLOUGHBY It is strange you should be reading them--for, look, I carry this with me always. \nIt is a miniature copy of the sonnets. MARIANNE is delighted, and, mutually astonished at this piece of synchronicity, they proceed to look up other favourites, chatting as though they were already intimates. \nMRS DASHWOOD smiles at ELINOR with satisfaction. ELINOR, amused, picks up her sewing. MARGARET stares. WILLOUGHBY and MARIANNE are oblivious to everything but each other. \nEXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN PATH - DAY \nWILLOUGHBY is leaving. He has a flower from MARIANNE's bunch in his buttonhole and is on his horse, looking about as virile as his horse. Everyone has come out to say goodbye, MARIANNE supported by ELINOR and MRS DASHWOOD. \nWILLOUGHBY Till tomorrow! And my pocket sonnets are yours, Miss Marianne! A talisman against further injury! \nMARIANNE Goodbye! Thank you! \nHe gallops off. They all wave. MARGARET follows him down the road for a while. \nELINOR Good work, Marianne! You have covered all forms of poetry; another meeting will ascertain his views on nature and romantic attachments and then you will have nothing left to talk about and the acquaintanceship will be over. \nMARIANNE I suppose I have erred against decorum. I should have been dull and spiritless and talked only of the weather, or the state of the roads. \nELINOR No, but Mr Willoughby can be in no doubt of your enthusiasm for him. \nMARIANNE Why should he doubt it? Why should I hide my regard? \nELINOR No particular reason, Marianne, only that we know so little of him-- \nMARIANNE But time alone does not determine intimacy. Seven years would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other and seven days are more than enough for others. \nELINOR Or seven hours in this case. \nMARIANNE I feel I know Mr Willoughby well already. If I had weaker, more shallow feelings perhaps I could conceal them, as you do-- \nThen she realises what she's said. \nMRS DASHWOOD Marianne, that is not fair-- \nMARIANNE I am sorry, Elinor, I did not mean \nELINOR I know. Do not trouble yourself, Marianne. \nELINOR turns back into the house. \nMARIANNE I do not understand her, Mamma. Why does she never mention Edward? I have never even seen her cry about him, or about Norland. \nMRS DASHWOOD Nor I. But Elinor is not like you or I, dear. She does not like to be swayed by her emotions. \nINT. BARTON COTTAGE - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - DAY \nCLOSE on Edward's handkerchief. We can see the monogram ECF clearly. \nCLOSE on ELINOR staring out of the window. Tears stand in her eyes but she presses the handkerchief to them before they fall. \nINT. BARTON PARK - DRAWING ROOM - EVE \nAfter dinner. Tea has been served. ELINOR, COLONEL BRANDON, MRS DASHWOOD and MRS JENNINGS play at cards. In a far corner of the room, MARIANNE is concentrating as she draws a silhouette. \nWILLOUGHBY's profile glows behind the screen in front of her, She looks up and stops, gazing, bewitched, at his beauty. The lips move--a whisper: Marianne. Then, louder: Haven't you finished? He moves out from behind the screen, eyes full of laughter. They look at each other. \nINT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY \nMR PALMER regards his wife with a less than enchanted expression. \nMR PALMER Nothing like. \nCHARLOTTE (laughing gaily) Why, Mr Palmer! Do you know you are quite rude today? He is to be an MP, you know, Mrs Dashwood, and it is very fatiguing for him for he is forced to make everybody like him-- he says it is quite shocking-- \nMRS PALMER I never said anything so irrational. Don't palm all your abuses of the language upon me. \nMRS JENNINGS (to Mrs Dashwood) Mr Palmer is so droll--he is always out of humour. \nMR PALMER does indeed have the air of a man under siege. WILLOUGH BY suddenly appears in his curricle. MARIANNE waves to him with a radiant smile. MRS JENNINGS nudges CHARLOTTE and points to MARIANNE. \nMRS JENNINGS Here he is! Now you shall see, Charlotte. \nWILLOUGHBY drives up as close to MARIANNE as possible, making her laugh. \nMRS JENNINGS How now, Mr Willoughby! You must greet my daughter Charlotte, and Mr Palmer-- \nWILLOUGHBY How do you do? \nMRS JENNINGS And my little cousin, Miss Lucy Steele. \nWILLOUGHBY Welcome to our party, Miss Steele! \nLUCY bobs demurely. WILLOUGHBY inclines his head politely, leaps from the curricle and hands MARIANNE in. MRS JENNINGS coos and chuckles at them. CHARLOTTE nudges ELINOR. \nCHARLOTTE I know Mr Willoughby extremely well-- not that I ever spoke to him but I have seen him forever in town. Your sister is monstrous lucky to get him. Mamma says Colonel Brandon is in love with her as well, which is a very great compliment for he hardly ever falls in love with anyone. \nELINOR smiles politely. WILLOUGHBY moves the curricle out to the front of the drive. CHARLOTTE points after them and laughs with MRS JENNINGS. LUCY edges up beside ELINOR. \nLUCY May I beg a seat beside you, Miss Dashwood? I have so longed to make your better acquaintance! I have heard nothing but the highest praise for you. \nELINOR is relieved to change the subject. \nELINOR I would be delighted. But Sir John and Mrs Jennings are too excessive in their compliments. I am sure to disappoint. \nLUCY No, for it was from quite another source that I heard you praised and one not at all inclined to exaggeration. \nLUCY speaks in a knowing, confidential undertone, as though not wanting anyone else to hear. At that moment a HORSEMAN thunders up the drive towards them. Everyone turns to face the new arrival. \nSIR JOHN What can this be? \nIt is a MESSENGER who has obviously had a long, hard ride. He asks for COLONEL BRANDON and hands him a letter, which BRANDON tears open. MRS JENNINGS is puce with suppressed curiosity. \nCOLONEL BRANDON My horse! Quickly! \nSIR JOHN What is the matter, Brandon? \nCOLONEL BRANDON I must away to London. \nSIR JOHN No! Impossible! \nEveryone gathers round BRANDON, who is, naturally, mortified. A SERVANT brings up the COLONEL's horse. \nCOLONEL BRANDON Imperative. \nThere is a murmur of disappointment from the party. SIR JOHN is embarrassed and protests again. \nSIR JOHN But Brandon, we are all assembled. We cannot picnic at Delaford without our host! Go up to town tomorrow. \nWILLOUGHBY Or wait till we return and start then--you would not be six hours later. \nCOLONEL BRANDON I cannot afford to lose one minute. \nAs he speaks, he is mounting his horse. His grave urgency silences all protest and he gallops off, leaving everyone stunned and, of course, deeply curious. Then they all start to talk at once. LUCY is still next to ELINOR. \nLUCY Oh, Miss Dashwood, I cannot bear it! Just when I was to have the opportunity of speaking with you. \nEXT. MEADOW NEAR BARTON COTTAGE - DAY \nHaving been denied their trip, the DASHWOODS and WILLOUGHBY have set out an impromptu picnic. WILLOUGHBY is wandering restlessly about. \nThe weather is sublime. \nWILLOUGHBY Frailty, thy name is Brandon! \nMARIANNE There are some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure. I think he wrote the letter himself as a trick for getting out of it. \nMRS DASHWOOD (indulgently) You are a very wicked pair, Colonel Brandon will be sadly missed. \nWILLOUGHBY Why? When he is the kind of man that everyone speaks well of and no one wants to talk to. \nMARIANNE Exactly! \nELINOR Nonsense. \nMRS DASHWOOD Colonel Brandon is very highly esteemed at the Park. \nWILLOUGHBY Which is enough censure in itself. \nELINOR (half laughing) Really, Willoughby! \nWILLOUGHBY (imitating Mrs Jennings perfectly) Come, come, Mr Impudence--I know you and your wicked ways--oh! \nHe gives a little shriek and waddles about the garden doing her walk. He comes up to ELINOR and puts his head on her shoulder. \nMRS DASHWOOD What is wrong, my dearest? \nMARIANNE shakes her head and waves them away. \nINT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY \nELINOR, MARGARET and MRS DASHWOOD enter to find WILLOUGHBY standing in a frozen attitude by the fireplace. \nMRS DASHWOOD Willoughby! What is the matter? \nWILLOUGHBY I--forgive me, Mrs Dashwood. I am sent--that is to say, Lady Allen has exercised the privilege of riches upon a dependent cousin and is sending me to London. \nHe cannot look any of them in the eye. \nMRS DASHWOOD When--this morning? \nWILLOUGHBY Almost this moment. \nMRS DASHWOOD How very disappointing! But your business will not detain you from us for long, I hope? \nWILLOUGHBY You are very kind--but I have no idea of returning immediately to Devonshire. I am seldom invited to Allenham more than once a year. \nMRS DASHWOOD For shame, Willoughby! Can you wait for an invitation from Barton Cottage? \nWILLOUGHBY My engagements at present are of such a nature--that is--I dare not flatter myself-- \nThe atmosphere is thick with tension. WILLOUGHBY flicks a glance at the three WOMEN staring at him in mute astonishment. \nWILLOUGHBY It is folly to linger in this manner. I will not torment myself further. \nHe rushes past them and out of the cottage. They follow him to the door. \nEXT. BARTON COTTAGE - FRONT DOOR - DAY \nThe DASHWOODS cluster round the door. \nMARGARET Willoughby, come back! \nShe is silenced by ELINOR as WILLOUGHBY seizes Bedivere's reins from THOMAS, mounts up and rides off at a furious pace. \nINT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY \nThey all rush back into the parlour. \nELINOR Meg, dearest, please ask Betsy to make a cup of hot tea for Marianne. \nMARGARET nods dumbly and goes. MRS DASHWOOD has her arms around MARIANNE. \nMRS DASHWOOD What is wrong, my love? \nMARIANNE Nothing! Please do not ask me questions! \nMARIANNE struggles free. \nMARIANNE Please let me be! \nShe runs off upstairs and we hear her bedroom door slamming. There is a moment of stunned silence. \nELINOR They must have quarreled. \nMRS DASHWOOD That is unlikely. Perhaps this--Lady Allen--disapproves of his regard for Marianne and has invented an excuse to send him away? \nELINOR Then why did he not say as much? It is not like Willoughby to be secretive. Did he think Marianne was richer than she is? \nMRS DASHWOOD How could he? \nShe gestures to the room and then looks at ELINOR with a frown. \nMRS DASHWOOD What is it you suspect him of? \nELINOR I can hardly tell you. But why was his manner so guilty? \nMRS DASHWOOD What are you saying, Elinor? That he has been acting a part to your sister for all this time? \nMRS DASHWOOD is getting defensive. ELINOR pauses to think. \nELINOR No, he loves her, I am sure. \nMRS DASHWOOD Of course he loves her! \nELINOR But has he left her with any assurance of his return? Cannot you ask her if he has proposed? \nMRS DASHWOOD Certainly not. I cannot force a confidence from Marianne and nor must you. We must trust her to confide in us in her own time. \nELINOR (shaking her head) There was something so underhand in the manner of his leaving. \nMRS DASHWOOD You are resolved, then, to think the worst of him. \nELINOR Not resolved-- \nMRS DASHWOOD (cold) I prefer to give him the benefit of my good opinion. He deserves no less. From all of us. \nShe stalks out of the room and starts up the stairs. ELINOR follows her. \nELINOR Mamma, I am very fond of Willoughby-- \nLUCY The youngest? No, I never saw him in my life. No, with Edward. \nELINOR Edward? \nELINOR stops walking. \nELINOR Edward Ferrars? \nLUCY nods. \nLUCY Edward and I have been secretly engaged these five years. \nELINOR is frozen to the spot. \nLUCY You may well be surprised. I should never have mentioned it, had I not known I could entirely trust you to keep our secret. Edward cannot mind me telling you for he looks on you quite as his own sister. \nELINOR walks on mechanically. Disbelief has set in. \nELINOR I am sorry, but we surely--we cannot mean the same Mr Ferrars? \nLUCY The very same--he was four years under the tutelage of my uncle Mr Pratt, down in Plymouth. Has he never spoken of it? \nELINOR (awareness dawning) Mr Pratt! Yes, I believe he has. \nLUCY I was very unwilling to enter into it without his mother's approval but we loved each other with too great a passion for prudence. Though you do nor know him so well as I, Miss Dashwood, you must have seen how capable he is of making a woman sincerely attached to him. I cannot pretend it has not been very hard on us both. We can hardly meet above twice a year. \nShe sniffs and produces a large handkerchief which she holds to her eyes so that the monogram is clearly visible. ECF. \nELINOR, seeing the copy of the handkerchief she has held so dear, moves quickly to a chair and sits down. \nLUCY You seem out of sorts, Miss Dashwood-- are you quite well? \nELINOR Perfectly well, thank you. \nLUCY I have not offended you? \nELINOR On the contrary. \nMRS JENNINGS has been watching. Now she rises, unable to contain herself. \nMRS JENNINGS I can stand it no longer, I must know what you are saying, Lucy! Miss Dashwood is quite engrossed! \nMRS JENNINGS starts to bear down on them. LUCY whispers with real urgency. \nLUCY Oh, Miss Dashwood, if anyone finds out, it will ruin him--you must not tell a soul! Edward says you would not break your word to save your life! Promise me! \nECU on ELINOR's face. \nELINOR I give you my word. \nMRS JENNINGS looms over them. \nMRS JENNINGS Well, what can have fascinated you to such an extent, Miss Dashwood? \nCHARLOTTE Tell us all! \nELINOR cannot speak but LUCY glides smoothly in. \nLUCY We were talking of London, ma'am, and all its--diversions. \nMRS JENNINGS Do you hear, Charlotte? \nMRS JENNINGS claps her hands delightedly. \nMRS JENNINGS While you were so busy whispering, Charlotte and I have concocted a plan! \nCHARLOTTE It is the best plan in the world. \nMRS JENNINGS I make for London shortly and I invite you, Lucy, and both the Misses Dashwood to join me! \nELINOR cannot hide her dismay. MARIANNE springs from her seat. \nMARIANNE London! \nMARGARET Oh, can I go! Can I go? \nMRS DASHWOOD You know perfectly well you are too young, dearest. \nMRS JENNINGS I shall convey you all to my house in Berkeley Street and we shall taste all the delights of the season--what say you? \nMARGARET Oh, please can I go? I'm twelve soon. \nCHARLOTTE Mr Palmer, do you not long to have the Misses Dashwood come to London? \nMR PALMER I came into Devonshire with no other view. \nELINOR exerts herself. \nELINOR Mrs Jennings, you are very kind, but we cannot possibly leave our mother... \nLUCY's calculating eyes turn to MRS DASHWOOD with alacrity. \nLUCY Indeed, the loss would be too great. \nA chorus of objections goes up, particularly from MRS DASHWOOD, who is both delighted and relieved to see MARIANNE with a smile on her face. \nMARIANNE looks out of the window. \nMARIANNE Yes, you are right. \nShe sits down with a rueful smile. Suddenly a much louder rap is heard and they both jump. We hear a bustling downstairs. MARIANNE can hardly breathe. She goes to the drawing-room door, opens it, goes out, comes back in. We hear a MAN's voice. \nMARIANNE Oh, Elinor! It is Willoughby, indeed it is! \nShe turns and almost throws herself into the arms of COLONEL BRANDON. \nMARIANNE Oh! Excuse me, Colonel-- \nShe leaves the room hastily. ELINOR is so ashamed of MARIANNE's rudeness that she does not at first notice BRANDON's mood of tense distress. \nELINOR Colonel Brandon, what a pleasure to see you! Have you been in London all this while? \nCOLONEL BRANDON I have. How is your dear mother? \nELINOR Very well, thank you. \nSilence. \nELINOR Colonel, is there anything-- \nBut BRANDON interrupts her. \nCOLONEL BRANDON Forgive me, Miss Dashwood, but I have heard reports through town... is it impossible to--but I could have no chance of succeeding--indeed I hardly know what to do. Tell me once and for all, is everything finally resolved between your sister and Mr Willoughby? \nELINOR is torn between discomfiture and compassion. \nELINOR Colonel, though neither one has informed me of their under standing, I have no doubt of their mutual affection. \nBRANDON stands very still. \nCOLONEL BRANDON Thank you, Miss Dashwood. To your sister I wish all imaginable happiness. To Mr Willoughby, that he... may endeavour to deserve her. \nHis tone is heavy with some bitter meaning. \nELINOR What do you mean? \nBut he recollects himself. \nCOLONEL BRANDON Forgive me, I--forgive me. \nHe bows and leaves abruptly. ELINOR is deeply troubled. \nEXT. GREENWICH ARCADE - LONDON - DAY \nThe PALMERS, MRS JENNINGS, JOHN, FANNY, LUCY, ELINOR and MARIANNE are walking through the arcade. Additional wealth has evidently encouraged FANNY sartorially and she sprouts as much fruit and feathers as a market stall. LUCY is holding ELINOR's arm in a pinionlike grip. MRS JENNINGS is gossiping with CHARLOTTE. \nMARIANNE's good looks are heightened by her feverish expectation of seeing WILLOUGHBY at every step, and many young men raise their hats to her and turn as she passes. \nMARIANNE Where is dear Edward, John? We expect to see him daily. \nFANNY stiffens. LUCY's sharp eyes dart hither and thither. MRS JENNINGS senses gossip. ELINOR steels herself. \nMRS JENNINGS And who is 'dear Edward'? \nCHARLOTTE Who indeed? \nFANNY smiles glacially. \nFANNY My brother, Mrs Jennings--Edward Ferrars. \nMRS JENNINGS looks at ELINOR in sly triumph. \nMRS JENNINGS Indeed! Is that Ferrars with an F? \nShe and CHARLOTTE chuckle to each other. LUCY looks at ELINOR. \nINT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - HALL - EVE \nMRS JENNINGS, LUCY, ELINOR and MARIANNE return from their outing. MARIANNE immediately assails PIGEON. \nMARIANNE Are there any messages, Pigeon? \nPIGEON No, ma'am. \nMARIANNE No message at all? No cards? \nPIGEON (affronted) None, ma am. \nMARIANNE sighs with disappointment and starts up the stairs. MRS JENNINGS looks archly at ELINOR. \nMRS JENNINGS I note you do not inquire for your messages, Miss Dashwood! \nELINOR No, for I do not expect any, Mrs Jennings. I have very little acquaintance in town. \nAnd she follows MARIANNE firmly upstairs. LUCY watches her go, and MRS JENNINGS chuckles and turns to her. \nMRS JENNINGS She is as sly as you, Lucy! \nINT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nELINOR wakes up. The flickering of a candle has disturbed her. She sits up in bed and sees MARIANNE sitting at the desk in her nightgown, writing another letter. \nWILLOUGHBY (stiff) How do you do, Miss Dashwood? \nELINOR does not know quite how to respond. \nELINOR I am well, thank you, Mr Willoughby. \nShe looks about for MARIANNE, instinctively wanting to keep her away from WILLOUGHBY. \nWILLOUGHBY How is your--family? \nELINOR (cold) We are all extremely well, Mr Willoughby--thank you for your kind inquiry. \nWILLOUGHBY is shamed into silence. Then he sees MARIANNE. At the same moment the music pauses. MARIANNE looks up. In the brief moment of relative quiet, her great cry rings across the room. \nMARIANNE Willoughby! \nEveryone turns to look as MARIANNE rushes towards him with both arms outstretched, her face luminous with joy. As the noise of the room builds again and PEOPLE change their partners, we are aware that many are surreptitiously watching. MARIANNE reaches him but WILLOUGHBY stands with his arms frozen at his side. MARIANNE gives a little confused laugh. \nMARIANNE Good God, Willoughby! Will you nor shake hands with me? \nWILLOUGHBY looks extremely uncomfortable and glances towards a group of very smart PEOPLE who are watching him closely. Central to this group is a SOPHISTICATED WOMAN who frowns at him proprietorially. \nWILLOUGHBY shakes MARIANNE's hand briefly. Behind her, MRS JENNINGS is giving an animated commentary to FANNY and JOHN, while LUCY whispers in ROBERT's ear as they go past to join the set. \nWILLOUGHBY (strangled) How do you do, Miss Marianne? \nMARIANNE Willoughby, what is the matter? Why have you not come to see me? Were you not in London? Have you nor received my letters? \nWILLOUGHBY is sweating with tension. \nWILLOUGHBY Yes, I had the pleasure of receiving the information which you were so good as to send me. \nMARIANNE (piteously) For heaven's sake, Willoughby, tell me what is wrong! \nWILLOUGHBY Thank you--I am most obliged. If you will excuse me, I must return to my party. \nHe bows, white to the teeth, and walks away to join the SOPHISTICATED WOMAN. \nMARIANNE Willoughby! \nHe is drawn away by his PARTY, some of whom look back at MARIANNE with a mixture of curiosity and condescension. MARIANNE almost sinks to her knees. ELINOR supports her. \nELINOR Marianne! Come away! \nMARIANNE Go to him, Elinor--force him to come to me. \nMRS JENNINGS has come up, full of concern. \nELINOR Dearest, do not betray what you feel to everyone present! This is not the place for explanations-- \nMRS JENNINGS Come along, dear. \nThey almost have to drag MARIANNE away. MRS JENNINGS turns back to the DASHWOOD party. FANNY and JOHN have practically imploded with embarrassment and are distancing themselves as much as possible from the source. LUCY and ROBERT are dancing nearby. \nMRS JENNINGS Will you come, Lucy? \nLUCY Oh, are we leaving so soon? \nROBERT If I might be so bold, Mrs Jennings, it would be our pleasure to escort your young charge home. \nLUCY How very kind! \nMRS JENNINGS That is very handsome-- \nShe rushes off to follow MARIANNE and ELINOR. We stay for a moment with LUCY and ROBERT who have left the set. \nROBERT She actually sent him messages during the night? \nCAM rises to show the DASHWOODS exiting past the whispering, sneering faces of the CROWD. \nINT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nMARIANNE sits scribbling a letter at the desk. \nELINOR Marianne, please tell me-- \nMARIANNE Do not ask me questions! \nELINOR You have no confidence in me. \nMARIANNE This reproach from you! You, who confide in no one. \nELINOR I have nothing to tell. \nMARIANNE Nor I. We have neither of us anything to tell. I because I conceal nothing and you because you communicate nothing. \nINT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - BREAKFAST ROOM - DAY \nA silent breakfast. MARIANNE is red-eyed from crying and limp from lack of sleep. MRS JENNINGS is dressed to go out, pulling on her gloves and bustling as usual. PIGEON enters with a letter on a salver. He offers it to MARIANNE. She seizes it and runs out of the room. MRS JENNINGS chuckles. \nMRS JENNINGS There now! Lovers' quarrels are swift to heal! That letter will do the trick, mark my word. \nShe goes to the door. \nMRS JENNINGS I must be off. I hope he won't keep her waiting much longer, Miss Dashwood. It hurts to see her looking so forlorn. \nELINOR is seated at a desk writing a letter. There is a sudden rap at the front door. Footsteps are heard and as she turns, the maid enters with COLONEL BRANDON. ELINOR rises to greet him. \nELINOR Thank you for coming, Colonel. \nHe bows. ELINOR is on edge. BRANDON looks haggard with concern. \nCOLONEL BRANDON How does your sister? \nELINOR I must get her home as quickly as possible. The Palmers can take us as far as Cleveland, which is but a day from Barton-- \nCOLONEL BRANDON Then permit me to accompany you and take you straight on from Cleveland to Barton myself. \nELINOR takes his hands gratefully. \nELINOR I confess that is precisely what I had hoped for. Marianne suffers cruelly, and what pains me most is how hard she tries to justify Mr Willoughby. But you know her disposition. \nAfter a moment BRANDON nods. He seems unable to remain still or calm and finds it difficult to begin speaking. \nCOLONEL BRANDON Perhaps I--my regard for you all-- Miss Dashwood, will you allow me to prove it by relating some circumstances which nothing but an earnest desire of being useful-- \nELINOR You have something to tell me of Mr Willoughby. \nCOLONEL BRANDON (nods) When I quitted Barton last--but I must go further back. A short account of myself will be necessary. No doubt... no doubt Mrs Jennings has apprised you of certain events in my past--the sad outcome of my connection with a young woman named Eliza. \nELINOR nods. \nCOLONEL BRANDON What is not commonly known is that twenty years ago, Eliza bore an illegitimate child. The father, whoever he was, abandoned them. \nThis is strong stuff. ELINOR's concern deepens. \nCOLONEL BRANDON As she lay dying, she begged me to look after the child. Eliza died in my arms, broken, wasted away--ah! Miss Dashwood, such a subject-- untouched for so many years--it is dangerous... \nHe paces about, barely able to conceal his distress. \nCOLONEL BRANDON I had failed Eliza in every other way--I could not refuse her now. I took the child--Beth is her name-- and placed her with a family where I could be sure she would be well looked after. I saw her whenever I could. I saw that she was headstrong like her mother--and, God forgive me, I indulged her, I allowed her too much freedom. Almost a year ago, she disappeared. \nELINOR Disappeared! \nCOLONEL BRANDON I instigated a search but for eight months I was left to imagine the worst. At last, on the day of the Delaford picnic, I received the first news her. She was with child... and the blackguard who had-- \nBRANDON stops and looks straight at ELINOR. \nELINOR Good God. Do you mean--Willoughby? \nBRANDON nods. ELINOR drops into a chair, utterly shocked. \nCOLONEL BRANDON Before I could return to confront him, Lady Allen learned of his behaviour and turned him from the house. He beat a hasty retreat to London-- \nELINOR Yes! He left us that morning, without any explanation! \nCOLONEL BRANDON Lady Allen had annulled his legacy. He was left with next to nothing, and in danger of losing all that remained to his debtors-- \nELINOR --and so abandoned Marianne for Miss Grey and her fifty thousand pounds. \nBRANDON is silent. ELINOR is breathless. \nELINOR Have you seen Mr Willoughby since you learned...? \nBRANDON (nodding) We met by appointment, he to defend, I to punish his conduct. \nELINOR stares at him, aghast. \nBRANDON We returned unwounded, so the meeting never got abroad. \nELINOR nods and is silent for a moment. \nELINOR Is Beth still in town? \nCOLONEL BRANDON She has chosen to go into the country for her confinement. Such has been the unhappy resemblance between the fate of mother and daughter, and so imperfectly have I discharged my trust. \nA pause. \nCOLONEL BRANDON I would not have burdened you, Miss Dashwood, had I not from my heart believed it might, in time, lessen your sister's regrets. \nBRANDON moves to the door and then stops. He turns to her and speaks with effort. \nCOLONEL BRANDON I have described Mr Willoughby as the worst of libertines--but I have since learned from Lady Allen that he did mean to propose that day. Therefore I cannot deny that his intentions towards Marianne were honourable, and I feel certain he would have married her, had it not been for--for the money. \nShe looks up at BRANDON. Silence. \nINT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nMARIANNE is sitting on the bed staring into space. ELINOR is kneeling by her, holding her hands. \nELINOR Dearest, was I right to tell you? \nMARIANNE Of course. \nELINOR Whatever his past actions, whatever his present course, at least you may be certain that he loved you. \nMARIANNE But not enough. Not enough. \nINT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - STUDY - DAY \nELINOR sits alone with her head in her hands. Suddenly MRS JENNINGS hustles in looking pleased. \nLUCY jumps in like a shot. \nLUCY In that case perhaps you might escort me back to your sister's house, Mr Ferrars? \nThere is an extremely awkward pause. \nEDWARD I would be honoured. Goodbye, Miss Dashwood, Miss Marianne. \nHe shakes hands with ELINOR and with MARIANNE, who is silent with dismay. LUCY takes EDWARD's arm and looks up at him proprietorially. \nAfter a stiff bow and a muttered farewell from EDWARD, they leave. MARIANNE looks at her sister in astonishment. \nMARIANNE Why did you not urge him to stay? \nELINOR He must have had his reasons for going. \nMARIANNE His reason was no doubt your coldness. If I were Edward I would assume you did not care for me at all. \nEXT. JOHN AND FANNY'S TOWN HOUSE - BACK GARDEN - DAY \nA tranquil afternoon... \nINT. JOHN AND FANNY'S TOWN HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - DAY \nLUCY is sitting with FANNY, who is doing some pointless basketwork. LUCY hands FANNY rushes. \nLUCY Poor Miss Marianne looked very badly t'other day. When I think of her, deserted and abandoned, it frightens me to think I shall never marry. \nFANNY Nonsense. You will marry far better than either of the Dashwood girls. \nLUCY How can that possibly be? \nFANNY You have ten times their sense and looks. \nLUCY But I have no dowry. \nFANNY There are qualities which will always make up for that, and you have them in abundance. It would not surprise me if you were to marry far and away beyond your expectations. \nLUCY I wish it might be so. There is a young man-- \nFANNY Ah ha! I am glad to hear of it. Is he of good breeding and fortune? \nLUCY Oh both--but his family would certainly oppose the match. \nFANNY Tush! They will allow it as soon as they see you, my dear. \nLUCY It is a very great secret. I have told no one in the world for fear of discovery. \nFANNY looks up, curious to know more. \nFANNY My dear, I am the soul of discretion. \nLUCY If I dared tell... \nFANNY I can assure you I am as silent as the grave. \nLUCY leans forward to whisper in FANNY's ear. \nEXT. JOHN AND FANNY'S TOWN HOUSE - DAY \nWe hold a long shot of the house for a moment of silence. Then from inside comes an almost inhumanly loud shriek. \nFANNY (V.O.) Viper in my bosom! \nEXT. JOHN AND FANNY'S TOWN HOUSE - BACK GARDEN - DAY \nFANNY is trying to drag LUCY out of the house. ROBERT and JOHN are trying to reason with her. FANNY loses her grip and falls backwards. LUCY flings herself into ROBERT's arms. ROBERT falls over. \nEXT. LONDON STREET - DAY \nMRS JENNINGS is running as fast as her fat little legs will carry her. \nEXT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - BERKELEY STREET - DAY \nMRS JENNINGS pants up the front steps. \nINT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY \nELINOR and MARIANNE are packing. Their mood is gloomy and uncommunicative. MRS JENNINGS explodes into the room fighting for breath. \nMRS JENNINGS Oh, my dears! What a commotion! Mr Edward Ferrars--the very one I used to joke you about, Miss Dashwood-- has been engaged these five years to Lucy Steele! \nMARIANNE lets out a gasp. She looks at ELINOR, who nods at her in swift confirmation. \nMRS JENNINGS Poor Mr Ferrars! His mother, who by all accounts is very proud, demanded that he break the engagement on pain of disinheritance. But he has refused to break his promise to Lucy. He has stood by her, good man, and is cut off without a penny! She has settled it all irrevocably upon Mr Robert. But I cannot stop, I must go to Lucy. Your sister-in-law scolded her like any fury--drove her to hysterics. \nShe leaves the room, still rabbiting on. There is a silence. \nMARIANNE How long have you known? \nELINOR Since the evening Mrs Jennings offered to take us to London. \nMARIANNE Why did you not tell me? \nELINOR Lucy told me in the strictest confidence. \nELINOR Yes. He means it as testimony of his concern for--for the cruel situation in which you find yourselves. \nNow EDWARD sits--in shock. \nEDWARD Colonel Brandon give me a parish? Can it be possible? \nELINOR The unkindness of your family has made you astonished to find friendship elsewhere. \nEDWARD looks at ELINOR, his eyes full of growing comprehension. \nEDWARD No. Not to find it in you. I cannot be ignorant that to you--to your goodness--I owe it all. I feel it. I would express it if I could, but, as you know, I am no orator. \nELINOR You are very much mistaken. I assure you that you owe it almost entirely to your own merit--I have had no hand in it. \nBut EDWARD clearly believes she has been instrumental in the offer. He frowns slightly before speaking with rather an effort. \nEDWARD Colonel Brandon must be a man of great worth and respect ability. \nELINOR finds some relief in saying at least one thing that she truly means. \nELINOR He is the kindest and best of men. \nThis makes EDWARD seem even more depressed. He sits silent for a moment but then rouses himself to action. \nEDWARD May I enquire why the Colonel did not tell me himself? \nELINOR I think he felt it would be better coming from... a friend. \nEDWARD looks at ELINOR, his eyes full of sadness. \nEDWARD Your friendship has been the most important of my life. \nELINOR You will always have it. \nEDWARD Forgive me. \nELINOR Mr Ferrars, you honour your promises-- that is more important than anything else. I wish you--both--very happy. \nThey rise. She curtsies. He bows. \nEDWARD Goodbye, Miss Dashwood. \nEDWARD leaves silently. ELINOR stands stock-still in the middle of the room. \nEXT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - DAY \nThe PALMERS' carriage stands outside the house. COLONEL BRANDON helps MARIANNE in beside ELINOR before mounting his horse to ride alongside. MRS JENNINGS waves goodbye from the steps. The carriage moves off. MRS JENNINGS blows her nose, looks up and down the street in search of gossip and goes back indoors with a sigh. \nINT. THE PALMERS' CARRIAGE - ON THE ROAD - DAY \nMARIANNE is sitting back in her seat with her eyes closed. She does not look well. MR PALMER is behind his newspaper. \nCHARLOTTE What a stroke of luck for Lucy and Edward to find a parish so close to Barton! You will all be able to meet very often. That will cheer you up, Miss Marianne. I do declare I have never disliked a person so much as I do Mr Willoughby, for your sake. Insufferable man! To think we can see his insufferable house from the top of our hill! \nCLOSE on MARIANNE's eyes slowly opening. \nCHARLOTTE I shall ask Jackson to plant some very tall trees. \nMR PALMER (from behind the paper) You will do nothing of the sort. \nEXT. THE PALMERS' CARRIAGE - OPEN ROAD - DAY \nThe carriage bowls along, with BRANDON riding next to it. \nCHARLOTTE (V.O.) I hear Miss Grey's bridal gown was everything of the finest--made in Paris, no less. I should have liked to see it, although I dare say it was a sorry affair, scalloped with ruffles--but what do the French know about fashion? \nEXT. CLEVELAND - DRIVE - AFTERNOON \nThe carriage stands outside the PALMER residence, a resplendent affair with a great deal of land. BRANDON is helping MARIANNE and ELINOR out of the carriage. \nCHARLOTTE (V.O.) I am resolved never to mention Mr Willoughby's name again, and furthermore I shall tell everyone I meet what a good-for nothing he is. \nMR PALMER (V.O.) Be quiet. \nELINOR and MARIANNE stand on the steps as the PALMERS debauch from the carriage amid a welter of SERVANTS. \nELINOR (sotto voce) I do not think she drew breath from the moment we left London. It is my fault--I should have found some other way of getting home. \nMARIANNE There was no other way you said so yourself. \nELINOR We shall be home soon enough. Mamma will comfort you, dearest. \nMARIANNE I am stiff from sitting so long. Will you tell Charlotte that I am going for a stroll? ELINOR glances at the sky in concern. \nELINOR I think it is going to rain. \nMARIANNE No, no, it will not rain. \nELINOR cannot help but smile at this return of the old MARIANNE. \nELINOR You always say that and then it always does. \nMARIANNE I will keep to the garden, near the house. \nMARIANNE walks off. ELINOR watches her go anxiously. \nMARIANNE Colonel Brandon. \nBRANDON turns back, his eyes full of tears. MARIANNE looks at him for a moment. Then, very quietly: \nMARIANNE Thank you. \nEXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN AND SURROUNDINGS - DAY \nThe cottage nestles in the first buds of spring. A piece of rope hangs down from the branches of a tree in the garden. It starts to wave about wildly and we see MARGARET emerging and climbing down. She has built herself a new tree-house. \nCOLONEL BRANDON (V.O.) What though the sea with waves continuall Doe eate the earth, it is no more at all. \nINT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY \nMARIANNE is on the sofa by the window. She is pale, convalescent and calm. Different somehow. She listens intently as BRANDON reads her the poem. \nCOLONEL BRANDON Nor is the earth the lesse, or loseth aught. For whatsoever from one place doth fall, Is with the tide unto another brought... \nWe move back to find MRS DASHWOOD and ELINOR at the other end of the room, sewing peacefully. \nMRS. DASHWOOD He certainly is nor so dashing as Willoughby but he has a far more pleasing countenance. There was always a something, if you remember, in Willoughby's eyes at times which I did not like. \nELINOR listens patiently as her mother rewrites history. We cut back to BRANDON as he finishes reading. \nCOLONEL BRANDON 'For there is nothing lost, but may be found, if sought... \nHe looks up at MARIANNE. A soul-breathing glance. She smiles as he closes the book. \nMARIANNE Shall we continue tomorrow? \nCOLONEL BRANDON No--for I must away. \nMARIANNE Away? Where? \nCOLONEL BRANDON (teasing) That I cannot tell you. It is a secret. \nHe rises to leave. \nMARIANNE (impulsive) But you will not stay away long? \nCLOSE on BRANDON's reaction. \nEXT. FIELDS NEAR BARTON COTTAGE - DAY \nELINOR and MARIANNE are out on a walk. They go very slowly, MARIANNE leaning on ELINOR's arm. Their mood is loving, companion able. \nEXT. DOWNS NEAR BARTON COTTAGE - DAY \nELINOR and MARIANNE walk on. Suddenly, MARIANNE stops. \nMARIANNE There. \nShe indicates a spot on the ground but ELINOR can see nothing and is momentarily alarmed. MARIANNE gazes at the ground and breathes in deeply. \nMARIANNE There I fell, and there I first saw Willoughby. \nELINOR Poor Willoughby. He will always regret you. \nMARIANNE But does it follow that, had he chosen me, he would have been content? \nELINOR looks at MARIANNE, surprised. \nMARIANNE He would have had a wife he loved but no money--and might soon have learned to rank the demands of his pocket-book far above the demands of his heart. \nELINOR regards MARIANNE admiringly. MARIANNE smiles sadly. \nMARIANNE If his present regrets are half as painful as mine, he will suffer enough. \nELINOR Do you compare your conduct with his? \nMARIANNE No. I compare it with what it ought to have been. I compare it with yours. \nELINOR Our situations were very different. \nMARIANNE My illness has made me consider the past. I saw in my own behaviour nothing but imprudence--and worse. I was insolent and unjust to everyone-- \nELINOR tries to stem the flow but MARIANNE continues. \nMARIANNE --but you--you I wronged above all. Only I knew your heart and its sorrows but even then I was never a grain more compassionate. I brought my illness upon myself--I wanted to destroy myself. And had I succeeded, what misery should I have caused you? \nELINOR embraces her. They stand with their arms round one another in silence for a moment. Then MARIANNE breaks away and speaks with great good humour and energy. \nMARIANNE I shall mend my ways! I shall no longer worry others nor torture myself. I am determined to enter on a course of serious study---Colonel Brandon has promised me the run of his library and I shall read at least six hours a day. By the end of the year I expect to have improved my learning a very great deal. \nEXT. ROAD NEAR BARTON COTTAGE - DAY \nTHOMAS is sitting on the back of a local wagon, holding a basket of food. \nHe jumps off near the cottage and waves a cheery farewell to the DRIVER. \nINT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY \nCLOSE on the accounts book, covered in blots and crossed-out sums. Pull up to reveal MARIANNE labouring over it. Her sickness has left her slightly short-sighted and she uses a pince-nez that makes her look like an owl. \nELINOR is sewing and MRS DASHWOOD is snoozing. MARGARET goes up and looks over MARIANNE's shoulder. She frowns at the spider's web of ink. \n", "test1_input": "MARIANNE The more I know of the world, the more I am convinced that I shall never see a man whom I can truly love. \nMRS DASHWOOD You require so much! \nMARIANNE I do not! I require only what any young woman of taste should a man who sings well, dances admirably, rides bravely, reads with passion and whose tastes agree in every point with my own. \nINT. NORLAND PARK - ELINOR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nELINOR is in bed, deep in thought. MARIANNE enters in her nightclothes, carrying a book of poetry. She reads, teasingly. \nMARIANNE Is love a fancy, or a feeling? No It is immortal as immaculate truth 'Tis not a blossom shed as soon as Youth Drops from the stem of life for it will grow In barren regions, where no waters flow Nor ray of promise cheats the pensive gloom-- \nShe jumps onto the bed. ELINOR smiles somewhat suspiciously. \nMARIANNE What a pity it is that Edward has no passion for reading. \nELINOR It was you who asked him to read and then you made him nervous. \nMARIANNE Me? \nELINOR But your behaviour to him in all other respects is perfectly cordial so I must assume that you like him in spite of his deficiencies. \nMARIANNE (trying hard) I think him everything that is amiable and worthy. \nELINOR Praise indeed! \nMARIANNE But he shall have my unanswering devotion when you tell me he is to be my brother. \nELINOR is greatly taken aback and does not know how to reply. Suddenly MARIANNE hugs her passionately. \nMARIANNE How shall I do without you? \nELINOR Do without me? \nMARIANNE pulls away, her eyes full of tears. \nMARIANNE I am sure you will be very happy. But you must promise not to live too far away. \nELINOR Marianne, there is no question of that is, there is no under standing between... \nELINOR trails off. MARIANNE looks at her keenly. \nMARIANNE Do you love him? \nThe bold clarity of this question discomforts ELINOR. \nELINOR I do not attempt to deny that I think very highly of him that I greatly esteem that I like him. \nMARIANNE Esteem him! Like him! Use those insipid words again and I shall leave the room this instant! \nThis makes ELINOR laugh in spite of her discomfort. \nELINOR Very well. Forgive me. Believe my feelings to be stronger than I have declared but further than that you must not believe. \nMARIANNE is flummoxed but she rallies swiftly and picks up her book again. \nMARIANNE 'Is love a fancy or a feeling?' Or a Ferrars? \nELINOR Go to bed! \nELINOR blushes in good earnest. MARIANNE goes to the door. \nMARIANNE (imitating Elinor) 'I do not attempt to deny that I think highly of him greatly esteem him! Like him!' \nAnd she is gone, leaving ELINOR both agitated and amused. \nINT. NORLAND PARK - BREAKFAST ROOM - DAY \nFANNY is standing by the window looking out. We see her POV of ELINOR and EDWARD walking in the garden. \nMRS DASHWOOD enters, pauses for a moment and then joins FANNY at the window. FANNY pretends not to have been watching but MRS DASHWOOD looks down at the lovers and then smiles sweetly at her. \nMRS DASHWOOD We are all so happy that you chose to invite Edward to Norland. He is a dear boy and we are all very fond of him. \nFANNY does a bit of quick thinking. \nFANNY We have great hopes for him. Much is expected of him by our mother with regard to his profession \nMRS DASHWOOD Naturally. \nFANNY And in marriage. She is determined that both he and Robert will marry well. \nMRS DASHWOOD Of course. But I hope she desires them to marry for love, first and foremost? I have always felt that, contrary to common wisdom, true affection is by far the most valuable dowry. \nFANNY Love is all very well, but unfortunately we cannot always rely on the heart to lead us in the most suitable directions. \nFANNY lowers her voice confidingly. \nFANNY You see, my dear Mrs Dashwood, Edward is entirely the kind of compassionate person upon whom penniless women can prey--and having entered into any kind of understanding, he would never go back on his word. He is quite simply incapable of doing so. But it would lead to his ruin. I worry for him so, Mrs Dashwood. My mother has always made it perfectly plain that she will withdraw all financial support from Edward, should he choose to plant his affections in less... exalted ground than he deserves. \nIt is impossible for MRS DASHWOOD not to get the point. She is appalled and furious. \nMRS DASHWOOD I understand you perfectly. \nShe sweeps off. \n", "test1_true": "MRS DASHWOOD, breathless with rage, is searching through her wardrobe for the gown which contains SIR JOHN's letter. Frocks fly hither and thither. Finally MRS DASHWOOD plunges her hand into the right pocket and withdraws the letter. She looks at it, suddenly concerned and anxious. \nINT. NORLAND PARK - DINING ROOM - EVE \nThe entire family is present. Everyone is watching MRS DASHWOOD, who has just made her announcement. \nEDWARD Devonshire! \nHe is devastated. FANNY is thrilled. MRS DASHWOOD looks at him with compassion and then at ELINOR, who is trying to keep calm. \nMRS DASHWOOD My cousin Sir John Middleton has offered us a small house on his estate. \nJOHN Sir John Middleton? What is his situation? He must be a man of property. \nMRS DASHWOOD He is a widower. He lives with his mother-in-law at Barton Park and it is Barton Cottage that he offers us. \nFANNY Oh, a cottage! How charming. A little cottage is always very snug. \nEDWARD But you will not leave before the summer? \nMRS DASHWOOD Oh, my dear Edward, we can no longer trespass upon your sister's good will. We must leave as soon as possible. \nMARGARET You will come and stay with us, Edward! \nEDWARD I should like that very much. \nFANNY Edward has long been expected in town by our mother. \nMRS DASHWOOD ignores FANNY. \nMRS DASHWOOD Come as soon as you can, Edward. Remember that you are always welcome. \nINT/EXT. NORLAND PARK - STABLES - DAY \nELINOR has come to say goodbye to her HORSE. She strokes the soft face sadly. Then she senses someone and turns to find EDWARD standing nearby. \nEDWARD Cannot you take him with you? \nELINOR We cannot possibly afford him. \nEDWARD Perhaps he could make himself useful in the kitchen? \nELINOR tries to smile. EDWARD looks at her for a long moment and then comes closer. \nEDWARD Miss Dashwood--Elinor. I must talk to you. \nThe use of her Christian name--and in such a loving tone-- stops ELINOR's breath altogether. \nEDWARD There is something of great importance I need... to tell you-- \nHe comes closer still. The HORSE breathes between them. ELINOR is on fire with anticipation but EDWARD looks troubled and has less the air of a suitor than he might. \nEDWARD --about--about my education. \nELINOR (after a beat) Your education? \nEDWARD Yes. It was less... successful than it might have been. \nEDWARD laughs nervously. ELINOR is completely bewildered. \nEDWARD It was conducted in Plymouth--oddly enough. \nELINOR Indeed? \nEDWARD Yes. Do you know it? \nELINOR Plymouth? \nEDWARD Yes. \nELINOR No. \nEDWARD Oh--well--I spent four years there-- at a school run by a--a Mr Pratt-- \nELINOR Pratt? \nELINOR is beginning to feel like a parrot. \nEDWARD Precisely--Mr Pratt--and there, I-- that is to say, he has a-- \nAs EDWARD flounders, a familiar voice cuts through this unexpected foray into his academic past. \nFANNY Edward! Edward! \nThey turn to find FANNY powering down upon them, waving a letter. EDWARD steps back, glancing almost guiltily at ELINOR, who is as confused as we are. \nFANNY I have been all over for you! You are needed in London this instant! \nEDWARD Fanny, I am leaving this afternoon as it is-- \nFANNY No, no, that will not do. Family affairs are in chaos owing to your absence. Mother is quite adamant that you should leave at once. \nFANNY is determined. She obviously has no intention of leaving him alone with ELINOR. EDWARD turns to ELINOR, frustration in every muscle, his jaw set tight. \n", "test2_input": "INT. CLEVELAND - DRAWING ROOM - DAY \nCHARLOTTE is handing ELINOR a cup of tea. ELINOR turns back to look out of the window. She freezes. \nEXT. CLEVELAND - GARDEN - DAY \nELINOR's POV of BRANDON walking up to the house with MARIANNE cradled in his arms. It is like seeing Willoughby's ghost. \nINT. CLEVELAND - HALL - DAY \nEveryone rushes out of the drawing room as the COLONEL enters with MARIANNE. He is exhausted and soaked. MARIANNE is dumb with cold and fatigue. \nCOLONEL BRANDON She is not hurt--but we must get her warm! \nELINOR and MR PALMER take MARIANNE from BRANDON and go upstairs, with CHARLOTTE in pursuit. \nEXT. CLEVELAND - NIGHT - RAIN \nThe great house sits in darkness. A sense of foreboding. \nINT. CLEVELAND - UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nELINOR is in her nightgown, knocking at a door. MR PALMER answers in his nightshirt, astonished to have been summoned out of bed. \nELINOR I think Marianne may need a doctor. \nINT. CLEVELAND - BREAKFAST ROOM - DAY \nMR PALMER and CHARLOTTE are sitting at the breakfast table. BRANDON is pacing. The rain has stopped. \nCHARLOTTE You'll wear yourself out, Colonel! Do not worry! A day or two in bed will soon set her to rights! \nMR PALMER You can rely upon Harris, Colonel. I have never found a better physician. \nEnter ELINOR with DR HARRIS. \nCOLONEL BRANDON (urgent) What is your diagnosis? \nDR HARRIS It is an infectious fever that has taken far more serious hold than I would have expected in one so young. I would recommend the hasty removal of your child, Mr Palmer-- \nCHARLOTTE runs out of the room screaming. \nCHARLOTTE Mrs Bunting! Mrs Bunting! \nEXT. CLEVELAND - FRONT STEPS - DAY \nCHARLOTTE is getting into their carriage with MRS BUNTING and BABY THOMAS. MR PALMER is on the steps with ELINOR. He takes her hand and looks at her with real sympathy. \nMR PALMER My dear Miss Dashwood, I am more sorry than I can say. If you would prefer me to stay I am at your service. \nELINOR is touched to find this warm heart beneath his frosty exterior. \nELINOR Mr Palmer, that is very kind. But Colonel Brandon and Dr Harris will look after us. Thank you for everything you have done. \nMR PALMER nods, presses her hand, and walks down the steps to the carriage. \nINT. CLEVELAND - DRAWING ROOM - DAY \nBRANDON sits head in hands. His ghosts have come to haunt him. \nINT. CLEVELAND - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - DAY \nMARIANNE is tossing and turning in the bed. DR HARRIS is trying to take her pulse. He looks up at ELINOR, who is watching anxiously. \nDR HARRIS She is not doing as well as I would like. \nINT. CLEVELAND - UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - DAY \nELINOR exits the bedroom to find BRANDON outside. She jumps. \nCOLONEL BRANDON What can I do? \nELINOR Colonel, you have done so much already. \nCOLONEL BRANDON Give me an occupation, Miss Dashwood, or I shall run mad. He is dangerously quiet. \nELINOR She would be easier if her mother were here. \nCOLONEL BRANDON Of course. Barton is but eight hours away. If I make no stop, you may see us early tomorrow morning. \nHe takes ELINOR's hand and kisses it. \nCOLONEL BRANDON In your hands I know she will be safe. \nEXT. CLEVELAND - DRIVE - EVE \nBRANDON mounts his horse, turns to look at the house for a moment, and then spurs it violently forward. \nINT. CLEVELAND - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - EVE \nELINOR is by the window, having watched BRANDON's departure. DR HARRIS is by MARIANNE's side. He turns to ELINOR. \nDR HARRIS Double the number of drops and I will return as soon as I can. \nEXT. CLEVELAND - NIGHT \n", "test2_true": "EXT. OPEN ROAD - NIGHT \nBRANDON riding fast, his cape billowing out behind him. \nINT. CLEVELAND - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nMARIANNE's eyes glitter with the fever. ELINOR wipes her brow. Suddenly she speaks. \nMARIANNE Who is that? \nShe is looking at the end of the bed. \nMARIANNE Look, look, Elinor. \nELINOR There is no one there, dearest. \nMARIANNE It is Papa. Papa has come. \nELINOR looks fearfully towards the end of the bed. MARIANNE tries to smile with her cracked lips. \nMARIANNE Dearest Papa! \nThe dead are coming for the dying. \nDISSOLVE: \nINT. CLEVELAND - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - LATER \nELINOR, her eyes red from watching, wipes MARIANNE's temples. DR HARRIS takes her pulse and looks at ELINOR anxiously. His silence is worse than any utterance. \nDISSOLVE: \nINT. CLEVELAND - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - LATER \nThe room is very still. MARIANNE is pale as wax. DR HARRIS puts on his coat. ELINOR looks at him fearfully. \nDR HARRIS I must fetch more laudanum. I cannot pretend, Miss Dashwood, that your sister's condition is not very serious. You must prepare yourself. I will return very shortly. \nHe leaves the room. \nDISSOLVE: \nINT. CLEVELAND - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - LATER \nMARIANNE lies in the grip of her fever. ELINOR sits watching her. Slowly she rises and walks to the bed. When she speaks, her tone is very practical. \nELINOR Marianne, Marianne, please try-- \nSuddenly, almost unconsciously, she starts to heave with dry sobs, wrenched out of her, full of anguish and heartbreak and all the more painful for being tearless. \nELINOR Marianne, please try--I cannot--I cannot do without you. Oh, please, I have tried to bear everything else-- I will try--but please, dearest, beloved Marianne, do not leave me alone. \nShe falls to her knees by the bed, gulping for breath, taking MARIANNE's hand and kissing it again and again. \nDISSOLVE: \nEXT. CLEVELAND - GARDENS - DAWN \nA shimmer of light appears on the rim of the horizon. Somewhere a lark breaks into clear untroubled song. \nINT. CLEVELAND - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - MORNING \nDR HARRIS sits slumped in a chair. MARIANNE lies motionless. ELINOR rises with difficulty from the bedside and goes to the window. She is white as paper. The lark sings. Then, from behind, comes the faintest of whispers. \nMARIANNE (V.O.) Elinor? \nELINOR turns with a cry. DR HARRIS springs from his seat and examines MARIANNE. He then turns to ELINOR with a smile of relief and nods. At that moment the sound of carriage wheels is heard on the gravel. \nELINOR My mother! \nEXT. CLEVELAND - FRONT STEPS - MORNING \nBRANDON helps MRS DASHWOOD, who is weak with exhaustion and distress, out of the carriage. \nINT. CLEVELAND - STAIRCASE - MORNING \nELINOR hurls herself down the stairs. She reaches the door just as BRANDON and MRS DASHWOOD enter and practically swoons into her mother's arms. \nELINOR Mamma!

CLEVELAND - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - MORNING \nCLOSE on MARIANNE's face as MRS DASHWOOD kisses her. \nMRS DASHWOOD There, there, my love, my Marianne. \nMARIANNE opens her eyes and smiles at her mother. MRS DASHWOOD takes her gently into her arms. MARIANNE suddenly looks anxious. She is too weak to move her head. She whispers with urgent effort. \nMARIANNE Where is Elinor? \nELINOR I am here, dearest, I am here. \nMARIANNE looks at her with deep relief. Behind the DASHWOODS, BRANDON stands at the door, unwilling to intrude on this intimacy. He wipes his eyes and turns away. MARIANNE sees and whispers to him. \n", "test3_input": "INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY \nThey carry the piano into the parlour and to the DASHWOODS' joyful astonishment it fits perfectly. MRS DASHWOOD reads out the letter that has accompanied it. \nMRS DASHWOOD 'At last I have found a small enough instrument to fir the parlour. I expect to follow it in a day or two, by which time I expect you to have learned the enclosed. Your devoted friend, Christopher Brandon.' \nMRS DASHWOOD hands MARIANNE the letter and a broadsheet song. \nMARGARET He must like you very much, Marianne. \nMARIANNE It is not just for me! It is for all of us. \nAll the same, she looks conscious of the truth. \nEXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN - DAY \nMARGARET is up her tree. ELINOR is pulling weeds. MRS DASHWOOD is sitting on a stool working on MARGARET's dress and listening to the strains of the new song which MARIANNE is singing in the cottage. All of a sudden, MRS DASHWOOD rises, shielding her eyes with her hand. She walks down to the gate, looking out. \nMRS DASHWOOD Here is Colonel Brandon! Marianne! \nThe piano stops. MARIANNE comes out and they all gather at the gate to watch for the rider. \nEXT. OPEN COUNTRY - DAY \nTheir POV of a HORSEMAN in the distance. \nEXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN GATE - DAY \nELINOR I do not think it is the Colonel. \nMRS DASHWOOD It must be. He said he would arrive today. You must play him the new song, Marianne. \nSuddenly there is a yell from MARGARET's tree. \nMARGARET Edward! \nMARGARET practically throws herself out of the tree onto the grass. \nMARGARET It is Edward! \nThe women look at each other in complete consternation. \nMRS DASHWOOD Calm. We must be calm. \nINT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY \nTense silence reigns. Everyone tries to busy themselves. BETSY enters. \nBETSY Mr Ferrars for you, ma'am. \nEDWARD follows her in, looking white and agitated. \nMRS DASHWOOD (rising) Edward! What a pleasure to see you. \nEDWARD Mrs Dashwood. Miss Marianne. Margaret. Miss Dashwood. I hope I find you all well. \nHe bows formally to each of them, lingering on ELINOR, who is looking firmly at her lap. He looks anxious. \nMARIANNE Thank you, Edward, we are all very well. \nThere is a pause while they all search for an appropriate remark. Finally MARGARET decides to have a go at polite conversation. \nMARGARET We have been enjoying very fine weather. \nMARIANNE looks at her incredulously. \nMARGARET Well, we have. \nEDWARD I am glad of it. The... the roads were very dry. \nMRS DASHWOOD decides to bite the bullet. \nMRS DASHWOOD (giving him her hand) May I wish you great joy, Edward. \nHe takes her hand somewhat confusedly and accepts her offer of a seat. There is an awful silence. MARIANNE tries to help. \nMARIANNE I hope you have left Mrs Ferrars well? \nEDWARD Tolerably, thank you. \nThere is another bone-crunching pause. \nEDWARD I--But EDWARD cannot seem to find any words. \nMRS DASHWOOD Is Mrs Ferrars at the new parish? \nEDWARD looks extremely confused. \nEDWARD No--my mother is in town. \nHe plucks up the courage to look at ELINOR again and is evidently not much comforted by what he sees. \nMRS DASHWOOD I meant to enquire after Mrs Edward Ferrars. \nEDWARD colours. He hesitates. \n", "test3_true": "They all stare at him in shock. \nMRS DASHWOOD Mrs Robert Ferrars? \nELINOR has frozen. EDWARD rises and goes to the window. \nEDWARD Yes. I received a letter from Miss Steele--or Mrs Ferrars, I should say-- communicating the... the transfer of her affections to my brother Robert. They were much thrown together in London, I believe, and... and in view of the change in my circumstances, I felt it only fair that Miss Steele be released from our engagement. At any rate, they were married last week and are now in Plymouth. \nELINOR rises suddenly, EDWARD turns and they stand looking at one another. \nELINOR Then you--are not married. \nEDWARD No. \nELINOR bursts into tears. The shock of this emotional explosion stuns everyone for a second and then MARIANNE makes an executive decision. Wordlessly, she takes MARGARET's hand and leads her and MRS DASHWOOD out of the room. \nEXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN - DAY \nThe three DASHWOODS come into the garden, still holding hands. \nINT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY \nELINOR cannot stop crying. EDWARD comes forward, very slowly. \nEDWARD Elinor! I met Lucy when I was very young. Had I had an active profession, I should never have felt such an idle, foolish inclination. At Norland my behaviour was very wrong. But I convinced myself you felt only friendship for me and it was my heart alone that I was risking. I have come with no expectations. Only to profess, now that I am at liberty to do so, that my heart is and always will be yours. \nELINOR looks at him, her face streaked with tears of released emotion, of pain and of happiness. \nEXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN \nMARIANNE and MRS DASHWOOD are stamping about in the garden trying to keep warm. MARGARET has climbed into her tree-house. The branches rustle. \nMARGARET He's sitting next to her! \nMRS DASHWOOD/MARIANNE Margaret, come down!/Is he? \nMRS DASHWOOD (scolding) Margaret! Will you stop-- \nMARIANNE What's happening now? \nMRS DASHWOOD Marianne! \nMARGARET (V.O.) He's kneeling down! \nMRS DASHWOOD can't help herself. \nMRS DASHWOOD Oh! Is he?

PATH NEAR BARTON COTTAGE - DUSK \nLater. The lovers walk slowly, their heads almost touching, their words low and intimate. \nELINOR Your mother, I suppose, will hardly be less angry with Robert for marrying Lucy. \nEDWARD The more so since she settled the money upon him so irrevocably-- \nELINOR --no doubt because she had run out of sons to disinherit. \nEDWARD Her family fluctuates at an alarming rate. Then, in London, when you told me of the Colonel's offer, I became convinced that you wanted me to marry Lucy and that--well, that you and Colonel Brandon... \nELINOR Me and Colonel Brandon! \nEDWARD I shall not forget attempting to thank him for making it possible for me to marry the woman I did not love while convinced he had designs upon the woman I did--do--love. \nEDWARD stops walking. He looks at ELINOR and realises he can stand it no longer. \nEDWARD Would you--can you--excuse me-- \nHe takes her face in his hands and kisses her. \nEXT. PATH TO BARTON CHURCH - DAY \nA group of VILLAGE CHILDREN run down the hillside towards the church waving ribbons and dressed in their Sunday best. \nEXT. BARTON VILLAGE CHURCH - DAY \nA large wedding party is gathered outside the church. The entire village is present--CHILDREN, FARMERS, LABOURERS, SHOPKEEPERS, and all our PRINCIPALS. We see MRS JENNINGS in a gigantic mauve bonnet, CHARLOTTE and MR PALMER, SIR JOHN, MRS DASHWOOD, MARGARET, THOMAS, JOHN and FANNY, who is dressed in a fantastically inappropriate concoction, and some MEN in regimental uniform. \nThe path to the church is strewn with wild flowers and everyone holds a bunch of their own. The church bells start to peal, and a great cheer goes up as the door opens and BETSY comes out holding the bridal cake aloft. \nThe bride and groom appear: MARIANNE, in white lawn, and COLONEL BRANDON in full uniform. Behind them come EDWARD in his parson's garb and, on his arm, ELINOR as matron of honour. \nCLOSE on them as they watch the party moving away. MARIANNE and BRANDON make their way forwards, everyone throws their flowers over them, whooping and singing. An open carriage decked with bridal wreaths comes to meet them, and BRANDON lifts MARIANNE in. His melancholy air is all but gone and he radiates joyful life and vigour. MARIANNE also looks extremely happy - but there is a gravity to her joy that makes her seem much older. \nAccording to the custom of the time, BRANDON throws a large handful of six pences into the crowd, and the VILLAGE CHILDREN jump and dive for them. \nThe coins spin and bounce, catching the sun like jewels. One hits FANNY in the eye. She reels and falls over backwards into a gorse bush. CAM pulls back as the wedding procession makes its glorious way from the church. We draw away into the surrounding countryside. \n"}

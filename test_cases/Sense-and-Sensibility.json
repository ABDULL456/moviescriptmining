{"test1_input": "CLOSE on ELINOR as she ponders the truth of this statement. \nINT. JOHN AND FANNY'S CARRIAGE - DAY \nJOHN and FANNY joggle on. \nJOHN Twenty pounds now and then will amply discharge my promise, you are quite right. \nFANNY Indeed. Although to say the truth, I am convinced within myself that your father had no idea of your giving them money. \nJOHN They will have five hundred a year amongst them as it is-- \nFANNY --and what on earth can four women want for more than that? Their housekeeping will be nothing at all they will have no carriage, no horses, hardly any servants and will keep no company. Only conceive how comfortable they will be! \nINT. NORLAND PARK - SERVANTS' HALL - DAY \nThe large contingent of SERVANTS who staff Norland Park are gathered in gloomy silence as ELINOR addresses them. \nELINOR As you know, we are looking for a new home. When we leave we shall be able to retain only Thomas and Betsy. \nCAM holds on THOMAS and BETSY, a capable woman. \nELINOR We are very sorry to have to leave you all. But we are certain you will find the new Mrs Dashwood a fair and generous mistress. \nEXT. NORLAND PARK. DRIVE - DAY \nJOHN and FANNY's carriage approaches Norland. \nFANNY (V.O.) They will be much more able to give you something. \nINT. JOHN AND FANNY'S CARRIAGE - DAY \nJOHN and FANNY are about to get out. \nJOHN So we are agreed. No money but the occasional gift of game and fish in season will be very welcome. \nFANNY Your father would be proud of you. \nINT. NORLAND PARK - DINING ROOM - EARLY EVE \nThe entire family, with the exception of MARGARET, is present. BETSY is serving food in an atmosphere of stiff silence. Cutlery clinks. JOHN chews loudly. MARIANNE is rigid with resentment. MRS DASHWOOD maintains a cool, removed dignity. ELINOR tries to play hostess. \nELINOR How is Mrs Ferrars? \nFANNY My mother is always in excellent health, thank you. My brother Robert is in town with her this season and quite the most popular bachelor in London! He has his own barouche. \nIn the brief silence which follows this, FANNY surreptitiously checks the hallmark on her butterknife. \nELINOR You have two brothers, have you not? \nFANNY Indeed, yes. Edward is the eldest Mamma quite depends upon him. He is traveling up from Plymouth shortly and will break his journey here. \nMRS DASHWOOD looks at ELINOR pointedly. JOHN notices. \nJOHN (to MRS DASHWOOD) If that is agreeable to you, of course. \nMRS DASHWOOD My dear John this is your home now. \nFANNY looks about, barely able to conceal her satisfaction. \nINT. NORLAND PARK - ELINOR'S BEDROOM - DAY \nELINOR is sitting with a little pile of parcels. She puts a shawl into some paper and ties it with ribbon as MARIANNE thunders in, looking mutinous. \nMARIANNE Fanny wishes to know where the key for the silver cabinet is kept. \nELINOR Betsy has it, I think. What does Fanny want with the silver? \nMARIANNE I can only presume she wants to count it. What are you doing? \nELINOR Presents for the servants. Have you seen Margaret? I am worried about her. She has taken to hiding in the oddest places. \nMARIANNE Fortunate girl. At least she can escape Fanny, which is more than any of us is able. \nELINOR You do your best. You have not said a word to her for a week. \nMARIANNE (truculently) I have! I have said 'yes' and 'no'. \nINT. NORLAND PARK - BREAKFAST ROOM - DAY \nFANNY, MRS DASHWOOD, ELINOR and JOHN are at breakfast. MARIANNE enters. ELINOR catches her eye and indicates FANNY with a slight motion of her head. MARIANNE makes a face. \nMARIANNE (very polite) Good morning, Fanny. \nFANNY is rather startled. \nFANNY Good morning, Marianne. \nELINOR is relieved. \nMARIANNE (to Fanny) How did you find the silver? Is it all genuine? \nELINOR rushes in before MARIANNE gets any further. \nELINOR Pray, when may we expect the pleasure of your brother's company? \n", "test1_true": "MARIANNE slams her cup down and throws a furious look at ELINOR. \nINT. NORLAND PARK - MARGARET'S BEDROOM - DAY \nELINOR and MARIANNE are removing MARGARET's toys. \nMARIANNE Intolerable woman! \nELINOR There is but one consolation if Edward is anything like Fanny, we shall be only too happy to leave. \nEXT. NORLAND PARK - DRIVE - DAY \nA very capable HORSEMAN (EDWARD FERRARS) canters up the gravel drive. \nCLOSE on his face as he gazes up at the elegant fa\u00e7ade. \nINT. NORLAND PARK - DRAWING ROOM - DAY \nEveryone except MARGARET is present. EDWARD has just shaken bands with ELINOR. He behaves with great respect to the DASHWOODS and seems embarrassed by FANNY's pro prietorial air. \nFANNY But where is Miss Margaret? I declare, Mrs Dashwood, I am beginning to doubt of her existence! She must run positively wild! \nMRS DASHWOOD Forgive us, Mr Ferrars. My youngest is not to be found this morning. She is a little shy of strangers at present. \nEDWARD Naturally. I am also shy of strangers and I have nothing like her excuse. \nMARIANNE (dangerous) How do you like your view, Mr Ferrars? \nELINOR glances at her warningly but EDWARD replies with careful consideration. \nEDWARD Very much. Your stables are very handsome and beautifully kept, Mrs Dashwood. \nFANNY Stables! Edward--your windows overlook the lake. \nEDWARD An oversight, Fanny, led me to the wrong room. I have rectified the situation and am happily settled in the guest quarters. \nMARIANNE and ELINOR look at each other in surprise. FANNY looks furious. \nMRS DASHWOOD smiles warmly at EDWARD. \nCLOSE on ELINOR. She is impressed. \nINT. NORLAND PARK - STAIRCASE - DAY \nFANNY is walking with EDWARD, who looks at the pictures with interest. \nFANNY They are all exceedingly spoilt, I find. Miss Margaret spends all her time up trees and under furniture and I have barely had a civil word from Marianne. \nEDWARD My dear Fanny, they have just lost their father their lives will never be the same again. \nFANNY That is no excuse. \nINT. NORLAND PARK - LIBRARY - DAY \nFANNY leads EDWARD in. She sniffs with distaste. \nFANNY I have never liked the smell of books. \nEDWARD Oh? No. The dust, perhaps. \nAs they speak, EDWARD notices a large atlas retreating apparently all by itself across the floor. Someone is obviously under the table, pulling it out of sight. He registers it and immediately moves in such a way as to shield it from FANNY. He turns back, searching for something to divert her. \nEDWARD I hear you have great plans for the walnut grove. \nFANNY Oh yes! I shall have it pulled down to make room for a Grecian temple. \nThere is a stifled wail from under the table, which EDWARD covers with a cough. \nEDWARD How picturesque. Will you show me the site? \nAnd he ushers FANNY out, flicking a quick glance over his shoulder at the fugitive's foot. \nINT. NORLAND PARK - VELVET ROOM - DAY \nELINOR, MRS DASHWOOD and MARIANNE are sitting round a table with a pile of letters. ELINOR is handing one back to her mother. \nELINOR Too expensive. We do not need four bedrooms, we can share. \nMARIANNE This one, then? \nELINOR reads the letter quickly. \nELINOR Marianne, we have only five hundred pounds a year. I will send out more inquiries today. \nThere is a knock on the door. Hesitantly, EDWARD appears. \nEDWARD Pardon my intrusion, but I believe I have found what you are looking for. \nMARIANNE and MRS DASHWOOD are puzzled by his elliptical manner but ELINOR immediately understands and rises, in smiling relief. \nINT. NORLAND PARK - ENTRANCE HALL OUTSIDE LIBRARY - DAY \nEDWARD is standing outside keeping a discreet lookout. The door is half open and he can hear ELINOR trying to coax MARGARET out. FANNY walks by with a BUTLER to whom she is giving instructions. EDWARD pretends to examine the mouldings and she passes on unsuspecting. \n", "test1_id": 72, "test2_input": "ELINOR I will put these in water. \nMRS DASHWOOD Our gratitude, Mr Willoughby, is beyond expression-- \nWILLOUGHBY But it is I who am grateful. I have often passed this cottage and grieved for its lonely state--and then the first news I had from Lady Allen when I arrived was that it was taken. I felt a peculiar interest in the event which nothing can account for but my present delight in meeting you. \nHe is merry, spirited, voluble--a breath of fresh air. ELINOR brings back WILLOUGHBY's flowers and places them next to BRANDON's on the side table. \nMRS DASHWOOD Pray sit down, Mr Willoughby. \nShe indicates a chair but WILLOUGHBY sees a book lying on MARIANNE's footstool, picks it up and--to her great delight-- sits down on the stool at her feet. \nWILLOUGHBY Who is reading Shakespeare's sonnets? \nEveryone answers at once. \nMARIANNE/ELINOR/MRS DASHWOOD I am. / We all are. / Marianne. \nMRS DASHWOOD Marianne has been reading them out to us. \nWILLOUGHBY Which are your favourites? \nIt is a general question but MARIANNE gaily commandeers it. \nMARIANNE Without a doubt, mine is 116. \nWILLOUGHBY Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments. Love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds, Or bends with the remover to remove--then how does it go? \nMARIANNE '0, no! it is an ever-fixed mark.' \nWILLOUGHBY joins in the line halfway through and continues. ELINOR and MRS DASHWOOD exchange glances. Clearly, their contribution to this conversation will be minimal. \nWILLOUGHBY 'That looks on storms'--or is it tempests? Let me find it. \nWILLOUGHBY gets out a tiny leatherbound book. \nWILLOUGHBY It is strange you should be reading them--for, look, I carry this with me always. \nIt is a miniature copy of the sonnets. MARIANNE is delighted, and, mutually astonished at this piece of synchronicity, they proceed to look up other favourites, chatting as though they were already intimates. \nMRS DASHWOOD smiles at ELINOR with satisfaction. ELINOR, amused, picks up her sewing. MARGARET stares. WILLOUGHBY and MARIANNE are oblivious to everything but each other. \nEXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN PATH - DAY \nWILLOUGHBY is leaving. He has a flower from MARIANNE's bunch in his buttonhole and is on his horse, looking about as virile as his horse. Everyone has come out to say goodbye, MARIANNE supported by ELINOR and MRS DASHWOOD. \nWILLOUGHBY Till tomorrow! And my pocket sonnets are yours, Miss Marianne! A talisman against further injury! \nMARIANNE Goodbye! Thank you! \nHe gallops off. They all wave. MARGARET follows him down the road for a while. \nELINOR Good work, Marianne! You have covered all forms of poetry; another meeting will ascertain his views on nature and romantic attachments and then you will have nothing left to talk about and the acquaintanceship will be over. \nMARIANNE I suppose I have erred against decorum. I should have been dull and spiritless and talked only of the weather, or the state of the roads. \nELINOR No, but Mr Willoughby can be in no doubt of your enthusiasm for him. \nMARIANNE Why should he doubt it? Why should I hide my regard? \nELINOR No particular reason, Marianne, only that we know so little of him-- \nMARIANNE But time alone does not determine intimacy. Seven years would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other and seven days are more than enough for others. \nELINOR Or seven hours in this case. \nMARIANNE I feel I know Mr Willoughby well already. If I had weaker, more shallow feelings perhaps I could conceal them, as you do-- \nThen she realises what she's said. \nMRS DASHWOOD Marianne, that is not fair-- \nMARIANNE I am sorry, Elinor, I did not mean \nELINOR I know. Do not trouble yourself, Marianne. \nELINOR turns back into the house. \nMARIANNE I do not understand her, Mamma. Why does she never mention Edward? I have never even seen her cry about him, or about Norland. \nMRS DASHWOOD Nor I. But Elinor is not like you or I, dear. She does not like to be swayed by her emotions. \nINT. BARTON COTTAGE - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - DAY \nCLOSE on Edward's handkerchief. We can see the monogram ECF clearly. \nCLOSE on ELINOR staring out of the window. Tears stand in her eyes but she presses the handkerchief to them before they fall. \nINT. BARTON PARK - DRAWING ROOM - EVE \nAfter dinner. Tea has been served. ELINOR, COLONEL BRANDON, MRS DASHWOOD and MRS JENNINGS play at cards. In a far corner of the room, MARIANNE is concentrating as she draws a silhouette. \nWILLOUGHBY's profile glows behind the screen in front of her, She looks up and stops, gazing, bewitched, at his beauty. The lips move--a whisper: Marianne. Then, louder: Haven't you finished? He moves out from behind the screen, eyes full of laughter. They look at each other. \nINT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY \n", "test2_true": "MRS DASHWOOD Surely you are not going to deny us beef as well as sugar? \nELINOR There is nothing under tenpence a pound. We have to economise. \nMRS DASHWOOD Do you want us to starve? \nELINOR No. Just not to eat beef. \nMRS DASHWOOD is silenced but sighs crossly. ELINOR looks over to the lovers and sees WILLOUGHBY in the act of cutting off a lock of MARIANNE's hair, which he kisses and places in his pocket-book. ELINOR is transfixed by this strangely erotic moment. WILLOUGHBY senses her gaze and looks over. She snaps her head back to her sums and is astonished to find that she has written 'Edward' at the top of the sheet. Hastily she rubs it out and writes 'Expenses'. \nEXT. BARTON CHURCH. DAY. \nMRS JENNINGS is talking to the elderly CURATE. Other PARISHIONERS exit the church as WILLOUGHBY's curricle (the eighteenth-century equivalent of a sports car) goes flying by. MARIANNE sits by his side, the picture of happiness. MRS JENNINGS nudges the CURATE and whispers. The PARISHIONERS stare after them and comment to each other. \nEXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN PATH - DAY \nMARIANNE and ELINOR are coming down the path together. MARIANNE is dressed to go out. The argument has evidently started indoors and is being continued here. \nMARIANNE If there was any true impropriety in my behaviour, I should be sensible of it, Elinor-- \nELINOR But as it has already exposed you to some very impertinent remarks, do you not begin to doubt your own discretion? \nMARIANNE If the impertinent remarks of such as Mrs Jennings are proof of impropriety, then we are all offending every moment of our lives-- \nThe conversation is halted by the arrival of COLONEL BRANDON on horseback. \nCOLONEL BRANDON (dismounting) Miss Dashwood! Miss Marianne! \nELINOR Good morning, Colonel! \nCOLONEL BRANDON I come to issue an invitation. A picnic on my estate at Delaford--if you would care to join us on Thursday next. Mrs Jennings's daughter and her husband are traveling up especially. \nELINOR Thank you, Colonel, we shall be delighted. \nAt that moment, WILLOUGHBY's curricle hoves into view and MARIANNE's face lights up. \nCOLONEL BRANDON (to Marianne) I will of course be including Mr Willoughby in the party. \nEven MARIANNE is a little embarrassed and recollects her manners. She smiles kindly at BRANDON. \nMARIANNE I should be delighted to join you, Colonel! \nThe COLONEL helps her into the curricle, exchanging nods with WILLOUGHBY, who is regarding him with some suspicion. \nWILLOUGHBY Good morning, Miss Dashwood; good morning, Colonel. \nMARIANNE The Colonel has invited us to Delaford, Willoughby! \nWILLOUGHBY Excellent. I understand you have a particularly fine pianoforte, Colonel. \nThe undercurrents of this conversation are decidedly tense. \nCOLONEL BRANDON A Broadwood Grand. \nMARIANNE A Broadwood Grand! Then I shall really be able to play for you! \nWILLOUGHBY We shall look forward to it! \nMARIANNE smiles her perfect happiness at him and he whips up the horses. They drive off, waving their farewells. \nBRANDON looks after them for a silent moment, and then collects himself and turns to ELINOR, who is less than satisfied with their behaviour. \nCOLONEL BRANDON Your sister seems very happy. \nELINOR Yes. Marianne does not approve of hiding her emotions. In fact, her romantic prejudices have the unfortunate tendency to set propriety at naught. \nCOLONEL BRANDON She is wholly unspoilt. \nELINOR Rather too unspoilt, in my view. The sooner she becomes acquainted with the ways of the world, the better. \nCOLONEL BRANDON looks at her sharply and then speaks very deliberately, as though controlling some powerful emotion. \nCOLONEL BRANDON I knew a lady like your sister--the same impulsive sweetness of temper-- who was forced into, as you put it, a better acquaintance with the world. The result was only ruination and despair. \nHe stops, and briskly remounts his horse. \nCOLONEL BRANDON Do not desire it, Miss Dashwood. \nEXT. BARTON PARK - DRIVE - DAY \nPeople and carriages fill the drive, the sun shines and the atmosphere is pleasantly expectant. SIR JOHN is organising the provision of blankets and parasols and COLONEL BRANDON is busy furnishing the DRIVERS with their routes. There are three new faces a pretty, blowsy WOMAN (CHARLOTTE PALMER), a stony-faced MAN (MR PALMER) and an exceedingly good-looking GIRL (LUCY STEELE), who are standing with ELINOR, MARIANNE, MARGARET, MRS JENNINGS and MRS DASHWOOD. \nMARIANNE is standing slightly apart, looking out along the road, impatient for WILLOUGHBY. \nMRS JENNINGS Imagine my surprise, Mrs Dashwood, when Charlotte and her lord and master appeared with our cousin Lucy! The last person I expected to see! 'Where did you pop out from, Miss?' says I. I was never so surprised to see anyone in all my life! \nLUCY STEELE smiles shyly and looks at the ground. MRS JENNINGS continues sotto voce to MRS DASHWOOD. \nMRS JENNINGS She probably came on purpose to share the fun, for there are no funds for such luxuries at home, poor thing. \nLUCY I had not seen you for so long, dear Mrs Jennings, I could not resist the opportunity. \nCHARLOTTE Oh, you sly thing! It was the Misses Dashwood she wanted to see, not Delaford, Mamma! I have heard nothing but 'Miss Dashwood this, Miss Dashwood that' for I don't know how long! And what do you think of them now you do see them, Lucy? My mother has talked of nothing else in her letters since you came to Barton, Mrs Dashwood. Mr Palmer--are they not the very creatures she describes? \n", "test2_id": 73, "test3_input": "LUCY The youngest? No, I never saw him in my life. No, with Edward. \nELINOR Edward? \nELINOR stops walking. \nELINOR Edward Ferrars? \nLUCY nods. \nLUCY Edward and I have been secretly engaged these five years. \nELINOR is frozen to the spot. \nLUCY You may well be surprised. I should never have mentioned it, had I not known I could entirely trust you to keep our secret. Edward cannot mind me telling you for he looks on you quite as his own sister. \nELINOR walks on mechanically. Disbelief has set in. \nELINOR I am sorry, but we surely--we cannot mean the same Mr Ferrars? \nLUCY The very same--he was four years under the tutelage of my uncle Mr Pratt, down in Plymouth. Has he never spoken of it? \nELINOR (awareness dawning) Mr Pratt! Yes, I believe he has. \nLUCY I was very unwilling to enter into it without his mother's approval but we loved each other with too great a passion for prudence. Though you do nor know him so well as I, Miss Dashwood, you must have seen how capable he is of making a woman sincerely attached to him. I cannot pretend it has not been very hard on us both. We can hardly meet above twice a year. \nShe sniffs and produces a large handkerchief which she holds to her eyes so that the monogram is clearly visible. ECF. \nELINOR, seeing the copy of the handkerchief she has held so dear, moves quickly to a chair and sits down. \nLUCY You seem out of sorts, Miss Dashwood-- are you quite well? \nELINOR Perfectly well, thank you. \nLUCY I have not offended you? \nELINOR On the contrary. \nMRS JENNINGS has been watching. Now she rises, unable to contain herself. \nMRS JENNINGS I can stand it no longer, I must know what you are saying, Lucy! Miss Dashwood is quite engrossed! \nMRS JENNINGS starts to bear down on them. LUCY whispers with real urgency. \nLUCY Oh, Miss Dashwood, if anyone finds out, it will ruin him--you must not tell a soul! Edward says you would not break your word to save your life! Promise me! \nECU on ELINOR's face. \nELINOR I give you my word. \nMRS JENNINGS looms over them. \nMRS JENNINGS Well, what can have fascinated you to such an extent, Miss Dashwood? \nCHARLOTTE Tell us all! \nELINOR cannot speak but LUCY glides smoothly in. \nLUCY We were talking of London, ma'am, and all its--diversions. \nMRS JENNINGS Do you hear, Charlotte? \nMRS JENNINGS claps her hands delightedly. \nMRS JENNINGS While you were so busy whispering, Charlotte and I have concocted a plan! \nCHARLOTTE It is the best plan in the world. \nMRS JENNINGS I make for London shortly and I invite you, Lucy, and both the Misses Dashwood to join me! \nELINOR cannot hide her dismay. MARIANNE springs from her seat. \nMARIANNE London! \nMARGARET Oh, can I go! Can I go? \nMRS DASHWOOD You know perfectly well you are too young, dearest. \nMRS JENNINGS I shall convey you all to my house in Berkeley Street and we shall taste all the delights of the season--what say you? \nMARGARET Oh, please can I go? I'm twelve soon. \nCHARLOTTE Mr Palmer, do you not long to have the Misses Dashwood come to London? \nMR PALMER I came into Devonshire with no other view. \nELINOR exerts herself. \nELINOR Mrs Jennings, you are very kind, but we cannot possibly leave our mother... \nLUCY's calculating eyes turn to MRS DASHWOOD with alacrity. \nLUCY Indeed, the loss would be too great. \nA chorus of objections goes up, particularly from MRS DASHWOOD, who is both delighted and relieved to see MARIANNE with a smile on her face. \n", "test3_true": "MRS DASHWOOD Of course I can! \nCHARLOTTE Of course she can! \nSIR JOHN And look at Miss Marianne--it would break her heart to deny her! \nMRS JENNINGS I will brook no refusal, Miss Dashwood! \nMARIANNE claps her hands, her eyes ablaze with joy. MRS JENNINGS takes ELINOR's hand. \nMRS JENNINGS Let you and me strike hands upon the bargain--and if I do not have the three of you married by Christmas, it will not be my fault! \nINT. BARTON COTTAGE - ELINOR/MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nWe are in ELINOR and MARIANNE's bedroom. ELINOR is in bed. She is lying on her side with her back to MARIANNE. We are CLOSE on her face. MARIANNE is running around excitedly, pulling out ribbons, looking at dresses, etc. \nMARIANNE I was never so grateful in all my life as I am to Mrs Jennings. What a kind woman she is! I like her more than I can say. Oh, Elinor! I shall see Willoughby. Think how surprised he will be! And you will see Edward! \nELINOR cannot reply. \nMARIANNE Are you asleep? \nELINOR With you in the room? \nMARIANNE laughs. \nMARIANNE I do not believe you feel as calm as you look, not even you, Elinor. I will never sleep tonight! Oh, what were you and Miss Steele whispering about so long? \nCLOSE on ELINOR's expression as she struggles with the impossibility of unburdening herself to her sister without breaking her promise to LUCY. After a pause-- \nELINOR Nothing of significance. \nMARIANNE looks at ELINOR curiously, then returns to her packing. \nEXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN GATE - DAY \nMRS DASHWOOD and MARGARET are waving MRS JENNINGS's carriage off. MARIANNE waves back with such exuberance that she practically falls out. \nINT. MRS JENNINGS'S CARRIAGE - ROAD TO LONDON - DAY \nMRS JENNINGS is chattering about London to MARIANNE, who listens with new-found tolerance. LUCY is whispering into ELINOR's ear. \nLUCY I have written to Edward, Miss Dashwood, and yet I do not know how much I may see of him. Secrecy is vital--he will never be able to call. \nELINOR I should imagine not. \nLUCY It is so hard. I believe my only comfort has been the constancy of his affection. \nELINOR You are fortunate, over such a lengthy engagement, never to have had any doubts on that score. \nLUCY looks at ELINOR sharply, but ELINOR is impassive. \nLUCY Oh! I am of rather a jealous nature and if he had talked more of one young lady than any other... but he has never given a moment's alarm on that count. \nWe can see from ELINOR's expression that she understands LUCY perfectly. The strain around her eyes is pronounced. \nLUCY Imagine how glad he will be to learn that we are friends! \nEXT. LONDON STREET - DAY \nMRS JENNINGS's carriage trundles along. \nEXT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - LONDON - DAY \nEstablishing shot of a handsome town house. MRS JENNINGS's carriage comes into shot and stops in front of it. \nINT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - HALL - DAY \nThey enter the grand hallway under the supercilious gaze of a powdered FOOTMAN (MR PIGEON). ELINOR is haggard after two days of close proximity with LUCY. MRS JENNINGS is all officious bustle and MARIANNE is feverish with anticipation. She whispers to MRS JENNINGS, who laughs heartily. \nMRS JENNINGS To be sure, my dear, you must just hand it to Pigeon there. He will take care of it. \nMARIANNE hands a letter to the sphinx-like FOOTMAN. We can see a large W in the address. ELINOR looks at MARIANNE inquiringly but MARIANNE moves away from her. \nMRS JENNINGS Lord above, you do not waste any time, Miss Marianne! \nMARIANNE glances self-consciously at ELINOR and follows MRS JENNINGS upstairs. LUCY goes up to ELINOR and whispers. \nLUCY A letter! So they are definitely engaged! Mrs Jennings says your sister will buy her wedding clothes here in town. \nELINOR Indeed Miss Steele, I know of no such plan. \nBut ELINOR does not know what else to say. She marches firmly upstairs. \nINT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - DAY \nMARIANNE and ELINOR have changed from their traveling clothes and are having a cup of tea. At least, ELINOR is. MARIANNE is pacing up and down in front of the window. \nELINOR John and Fanny are in town. I think we shall be forced to see them. \nThere is a faint knocking from somewhere. MARIANNE jumps. \nELINOR I think it was for next door. \n", "test3_id": 74}

. . . um . . . yeah, I dunno, I guess? 
COLONEL 
Can I see it? 
DIRK 
Really? 
COLONEL 
Please. 
Dirk unzips his pants. CAMERA on the Colonel. He looks down, then up: 
COLONEL 
Thank you, Eddie. 
DIRK 
No problem. 
Dirk exits. The Colonel turns to Jack; 
COLONEL 
Jesus Christ. Jesus Lord in Heaven. 
CAMERA picks up with Dirk, who runs for the pool and DIVES IN . . . . 
CUT TO: 
48 INT. POOL - THAT MOMENT 
CAMERA MOVES IN AS DIRK LANDS IN THE WATER, FLOATS TO THE BOTTOM, THEN PUSHES OFF, TOWARDS THE SURFACE. TIME LAPSE TO NIGHT. 
CUT TO: 
49 EXT. DRIVEWAY/JACK'S HOUSE - NIGHT (LATER) 
The party is coming to a close and people are trying to get in their cars and get out of the driveway. 
CAMERA hangs with Little Bill and his Wife. 
LITTLE BILL 
Thanks for fucking up this party for me. 
I appreciate it. 
LITTLE BILL'S WIFE 
Oh Fuck Off. Will You? 
LITTLE BILL 
You Fuck Off. 
LITTLE BILL'S WIFE 
Yeah, right. 
CAMERA MOVES TO FIND: THE YOUNG STUD AND THE LIMO DRIVER. 
They're sitting by the limo. The Young Stud is crying. 
LIMO DRIVER 
Hey, hey, hey. I mean: How were 
you supposed to know? 
YOUNG STUD 
I wasn't. 
LIMO DRIVER 
That's right. So what did you do wrong? 
YOUNG STUD 
Nothing? 
LIMO DRIVER 
Nothing is absolutely right, Young Stud. 
YOUNG STUD 
Thank you for your help. 
LIMO DRIVER 
No problem. 
The Colonel and Jack approach. The Colonel now has ANOTHER YOUNG LADY FRIEND, picked up from the party. 
COLONEL 
You ready, Johnny? 
LIMO DRIVER 
Yes, sir. 
COLONEL 
How you doin', pal? 
YOUNG STUD 
I'm okay, sir. 
COLONEL 
Don't worry about it. She'll be fine. 
YOUNG STUD 
She died in the limo on the way to the hospital. 
COLONEL 
I didn't hear that. 
YOUNG STUD 
What? 
COLONEL 
You never told me that and what happened, 
never happened. You got me? 
YOUNG STUD 
I get you. 
COLONEL 
Now go home. Sleep it off. 
The Young Stud exits. 
JACK 
Thanks for coming, Colonel. 
COLONEL 
Great party, Jack. 
The Colonel and the new Lady Friend get in the car. 
CUT TO: 
50 EXT. JACK'S HOUSE/POOL AREA - NIGHT (LATER) 
The party is over. Amber and Rollergirl are inside playing cards. Scotty J. is cleaning up, Dirk and Reed sit in the JACUZZI, looking up at the stars. 
REED 
. . . you wanna hear a poem I wrote? 
DIRK 
Yeah. 
REED 
Okay. Um . . . 
"I love you. You love me. 
Going down the Sugar Tree. 
We'll go down the Sugar Tree. 
And See Lots of Bees. Playing. 
Playing. The bees won't sting. 
'Cause you love me." 
DIRK 
That's fucking great, man. 
Jack approaches in a bath robe, holding a towel. 
JACK 
Howdy-boys. 
DIRK/REED 
Hey, Jack. 
Jack removes his robe and climbs in the Jacuzzi. 
JACK 
Good party? 
DIRK 
It was great. 
JACK 
Good. You had a good time then? 
DIRK 
Excellent time. Thank you. 
JACK 
What this place is for, right? 
REED 
Right. 
JACK 
Ahhhh . . . this feels good. Bubbles. 
Turn those bubbles higher, Reed. 
DIRK 
Jack . . . I was thinking about my name . . . y'know . . . ? 
JACK 
Yeah? 
DIRK 
I was wondering if you had any ideas. 
JACK 
I've got a few . . . but you tell me . . . 
DIRK 
Well . . . my idea was . . . y'know . . . 
I want a name . . . I want it so it 
can cut glass . . . y'know . . . razor sharp. 
JACK 
Tell me.

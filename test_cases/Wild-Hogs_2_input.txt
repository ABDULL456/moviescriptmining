WOODY (yells after him) Don't hang it on a tree! 
DOUG Yup... These are the times we'll remember. After a minute, Doug turns to Woody and Bob.

DOUG (CONT'D) Hey, when was the last time you guys heard me sing Bon Jovi? 
WOODY Oh, man. Thank God that stopped. 
BOB It's been awhile. You're not as obnoxious as you used to be. You used to eat a lot more buffalo wings, too. 
DOUG Yeah, I know. Turns out there's carbs in the batter. Hey, you know what? Maybe carbs are what I need to get old Doug back. 
WOODY Old Doug? You've lost your Dad? 
DOUG No. I think I've lost me. It's this thing Kelly said. 
(BEAT) You know what it is? I think I'm tame. I'm like a lion that used to be wild, but now I'm in some Disney park where tourists come by and take pictures of me like I'm a lion, but after they leave, I go into my kennel and eat antelope nuggets or something. Ones without carbs. 
BOB I know what you're talking about. I lost old Bob, too. I think my wife and daughters killed him. I'm surrounded by women every minute of my life. And it's made me, you know... 
DOUG A wimp? 
BOB What? No. I was going to say miserable. You think I'm a wimp? 
DOUG No. I just thought that was what you were... I thought you wanted us to guess, and I didn't have a guess, so I said "wimp." Knowing it was wrong...

WOODY You're a wimp, Bob. I'll say it. You're afraid of girls. It's embarrassing. Dudley comes up and sits back down. 
DUDLEY I'm afraid of girls. 
WOODY You're afraid to talk to one. Bob is afraid they'll kill him in his sleep. 
DUDLEY Wow. Now I really don't want to talk to one. 
BOB You know, it's not always so bad. Like, when Karen sleeps, she still crawls over and pushes up against me. Just snuggles right up like she needs me. I like that. I like that a lot. (then, sobering) Then the sun comes up and turns her into a raging she-demon. 
DOUG Yeah, I guess life just isn't as simple as it was when we were in college. Well, except for you, Woody. You're still living the fairy tale. Swimsuit model wife. Big job at an investment firm. You've got the good life. Woody doesn't respond. He just stares vacantly into the fire for a beat. 
WOODY 
(FLATLY) Yeah... The good life. I'm a lucky man. 
DUDLEY My life blows. I don't have a family. Or a wife. I have a cat that doesn't like me. She wouldn't even stick around if she knew how to use a can opener. The guys all look at Dudley. 
BOB Hey, Dudley. You've got us, buddy. And you're going to get a woman, too.

BOB (CONT'D) I told you we were going to hit some strip clubs when we get back. 
DUDLEY Nah, I don't like those places-- 
BOB Dudley-- Please. I'm trying to help you here. 
DUDLEY I know. I just don't-- 
BOB Please! Strippers are nice to me! 
DUDLEY Okay... Sorry. We'll go. 
BOB Thanks, man. 
(THEN) I'm just... trying to be a good friend. 
DOUG We know, Bob. 
WOODY I'll go, too. 
DOUG There's a surprise. Doug pulls a flaming marshmallow out of the fire.

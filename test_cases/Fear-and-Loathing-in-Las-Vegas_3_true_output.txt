DUKE You'll go straight to the gas chamber.  And even if you manage to beat that, they'll send you back to Nevada for Rape and Consensual Sodomy.  She's got to go. 
Pause. 
GONZO Shit, it doesn't pay to try to help somebody these days. 
A silence. 
DUKE (V/O) The only alternative was to take her out to the desert and feed her remains to the lizards.  But, it seemed a bit heavy for the thing we were trying to protect: My attorney. 
GONZO We have to cut her loose.  She's got two hundred dollars.  And we can always call the cops up there in Montana, where she lives, and turn her in. 
DUKE What?... What kind of goddamn monster are you? 
GONZO It just occurred to me, that she has no witnesses.  Anything that she says about us is completely worthless. 
DUKE Us? 
INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - SUNSET 
DUKE is speaking into the phone in hushed tones. 
DUKE Hotel Americana?  I need a reservation.  For my niece.  Listen, I need her treated very gently. She's an artist, and might seem a trifle highstrung... 
In the background GONZO helps LUCY and her paintings out the door. 
GONZO Okay, Lucy, it's time to go meet Barbra... 
DUKE (V/O) I felt like a Nazi, but it had to be done. 
EXT. ON THE STREETS - A CAB STAND - DUSK 
The WHITE WHALE pulls up -- DUKE at the wheel.  GONZO helps LUCY and her paintings from the car. 
DUKE (V/O) Lucy was a potentially fatal millstone on both our necks.  There was absolutely no choice but to cut her adrift and hope her memory was fucked. 
GONZO unrolls a couple of bills -- pays off a CAB DRIVER -- waves to LUCY in the back with her paintings.  She's starting to come down... 
GONZO gets back in the WHITE WHALE and slaps his hands together as if washing his hands of the situation. 
GONZO Well that's that.  Take off slowly. Don't attract attention. 
They pull out into traffic. 
EXT. LAS VEGAS STREETS - DUSK 
GONZO I gave the cabbie an extra ten bucks to make sure she gets there safe.  Also, I told him I'd be there myself in an hour, and if she wasn't, I'd come back out here and rip his lungs out. 
DUKE That's good.  You can't be subtle in this town. 
GONZO As your attorney, I advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline. 
DUKE Maybe we should take it easy tonight. 
GONZO Right.  Let's find a good seafood restaurant and eat some red salmon. I feel a powerful lust for red salmon... 
The electric WHITE WHALE heads off down the Strip.  The sun's going down behind the scrub hills, a good Kristofferson tune croaks on the radio in the warm dusk. 
INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - BATHROOM - NEXT MORNING 
GONZO throws up in the toilet bowl. 
In the background, DUKE opens curtains.  Daylight blinds him. 
DUKE Come on, we're going to be late. 
GONZO looks up at his sick reflection -- wipes his mouth with a towel. 
GONZO This goddamn mescaline.  Why the fuck can't they make it a little less pure?  Maybe mix it up with Rolaids or something.

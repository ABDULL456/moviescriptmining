INT. FRANK AND APRIL'S BEDROOM - MORNING. 
April makes the bed. 
She arranges her shoes on the floor of the closet. 
April reaches onto a shelf behind some clothes.   Pulls out the brown paper package. 
INT. WHEELER KITCHEN - MORNING. 
April stands at the stove over a pot of rolling, boiling water. 
She removes the rubber syringe from its paper packaging and drops it into the pot. She checks her watch. 
INT. WHEELER HALLWAY - DAY. 
April carries the pot of boiling, sudsy water down the hall. 
INT. WHEELER BATHROOM - DAY. 
April places the pot into the tub.   She lays towels across the floor. And closes the door... 
INT. WHEELER BATHROOM - DAY, MOMENTS LATER. 
The SOUND of running water. The empty mirror.     April's face rises up into the reflection with a gasp. 
INT. WHEELER HALLWAY - DAY. 
We move with April down the hallway, her face is pale. 
INT. WHEELER LIVING ROOM - DAY, LATER. 
Now April stands at the picture window.    She is shaking. 
A DROPLET of blood slides down her knee.   She looks down. 
On the floor, two droplets of blood appear between her bare feet... 
Now we see the bright maple leaf of blood seeping through her skirt. She is shaking more. 
She walks slowly out of the room, towards the kitchen. 
APRIL (O.S.) I think I need an ambulance.... Yes... One one five Revolutionary Road. 
INT. CAMPBELL KITCHEN - DAY. 
Milly folds laundry. She looks up to see - 
An ambulance turns into the Wheeler's driveway.   Her face clouds with instinctual foreboding. 
INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - AFTERNOON. 
Shep steps out into a hospital hallway. 
Frank paces, helpless in the waiting room, his face a mask of bewildered, childlike confusion. He looks up to see - 
Shep coming towards him. 
SHEP Frank? They tell you what happened? 
FRANK Jesus, Shep. I couldn't even understand half the things he told me. He said the fetus was out before they got her here. He said they had to operate to take out the whatdycallit, the placenta and now she's still bleeding. He said she'd lost a lot of blood before the ambulance came, and now they're trying to stop it, and he said a whole lot of things I didn't get, about capillaries, and he said she's unconscious. Jesus. 
SHEP How about sitting down, Frank. 
FRANK What the hell do I want to sit down for! 
SHEP Okay.   Take it easy.

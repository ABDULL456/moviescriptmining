LOUIS Something hit me and I blacked out. I don't know for how long. 
MICK That was all? 
LOUIS Then when I woke up these guys were on me, telling me not to move. I couldn't anyway. I was too scared. Mick moves toward Louis, as if determined to find flaws... 
MICK But, there was blood on your jacket and your left hand... 
LOUIS Someone put it there because I didn't. 
MICK Are you left-handed? 
LOUIS No. 
MICK You didn't strike Ms. Campo with your left fist? 
LOUIS No! 
MICK Threaten to rape her, or kill her?-- 
LOUIS No! 
MICK You're angry. Why? 
LOUIS (passionate but simple--) Do you know what it's like to be accused of something like this? To listen to people tell lies about your having done something so sick and awful? I, I understand I had to be quiet and wait my chance and not say anything-- but if guilty people have rights, what about innocent people? I am innocent! Mick. Meets Louis's eye, communicates: You were perfect. 
MICK Nothing further, Judge. Ted already up & moving, passes Mick as he takes his seat-- 
TED According to you, Ms. Campo punched herself or had a man she never met before punch her lights out as part of a set-up? 
LOUIS All I know is that I didn't. 
TED And this knife you always carry, how did she know she'd find it on you as part of the set-up? 
LOUIS 
("HONEST") She couldn't, could she? I mean, I never took it out or showed it to anybody-- so she must have just found it when she went into my pocket for the money I had that I was going to pay her with, right?-- 
M. 
TED I'd really prefer it if I ask the questions, and you answer them! (then calming himself) Would you look at this, please-- Goes to the easel, REVEALS: PHOTO of Reggie's beaten face. 
TED (CONT'D) Please tell us again if you think Regina Campo would or could have done this to herself. 
LOUIS I don't know who did it, but it wasn't me. Nobody deserves that to happen... 
TED (seizes on this) What do you mean by "deserves?" Do you mean crimes of violence come down to a whether a woman gets what she "deserves?" 
LOUIS (right back at him) I mean no matter what she does for a living or who she is-- No woman deserves that. Ted keeps staring at the photo: Wants the jury looking there. 
TED I have no more questions. At which, suddenly there's a wave of movement-- SLOW-MOTION-- Louis dismissed from the chair-- Ted returning to his seat, passing Mick as Mick rises-- Louis gives Mick a "How'd I do?" look, Mick nods, unmistakably, "You did fine..."-- Mick's look finds Ted-- Mick and Ted holding each other in a gaze-- Mick's face in a kind of smile, Ted grim-- As Mick brings out, speaking to the Judge but his smiling eyes fixed on the unhappy Ted-- RESUME NORMAL SPEED for Mick's confident, fateful words: 
MICK Your honor, the defense rests. 
Ted hears this, sets his jaw. Fullbright turns to him. 
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Mr. Minton? Ted is uncertain... 
TED Your honor... (She waits.) The state needs the night to decide, your honor... 
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT To decide what? 
TED Frankly I wasn't anticipating the defense would rest after two witnesses. I-- I'd like the night to consider calling a rebuttal witness. 
MICK (reacts, "objects--") Your honor, first we've heard of 
THIS-- 
TED I said `-consider." I need to find out if the witness is even 
AVAILABLE-- 
MICK The state still has an obligation to disclose the identity-- 
TED Not if I decide not to use him. (a note of pleading) I'm begging the court's indulgence, your honor. Fulbright doesn't like it... but weighs, yields. Go to, 
CRACK OF THUNDER: EXT. NIGHT SKY, CLOUDS, RAIN. REVEAL...

MATHILDE Buy yourself a retirement clock. 
Her American accent shows that she's letting her guard down. Maybe it's designed to make JACK do the same. 
It doesn't. 
JACK How do you know I'm retiring? 
She leans forward and kisses him lightly and quickly and on the lips. 
MATHILDE Have you taken your girl up to the meadow yet? 
JACK doesn't answer. His whole body is tense for the bullet that he knows his coming. Perhaps there is a second person in the car. 
Just then... 
...a COACH pulls into the car park. 
It stops with a hydraulic hiss and dozens of TEENAGE KIDS descend. 
MATHILDE looks both irritated and relieved. 
MATHILDE (whispers to JACK) Do it. 
She gets into the driver's seat of the FORD and swings the BRIEFCASE into the back. 
MATHILDE Goodbye, Mr. Butterfly. 
JACK tenses as MATHILDE raises her hand in farewell. 
The FORD pulls away and disappears down the slip road onto the autostrada. 
JACK watches it go. 
Thumbs back the lever on his Walther. 
Gets into his Citroen. 
And opens the ENVELOPE. 
-No wires. 
-No tricks. 
-Just a HUNDRED THOUSAND US DOLLARS. 
JACK stares at the money. He isn't supposed to be alive. For a while he stays put. He shuts his eyes in the sunshine and listens to the laughter of the teenage kids. To a girl calling: "Amore!" To the cicadas. To the distant rush of traffic on the autostrada. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
148   EXT. AUTOSTRADA- DAY                                          148 
JACK drives fast... 
...turning off the highway beneath a sign for L'AQUILA. 
149   EXT. L'AQUILA- DAY                                            149 
At the end a small street, JACK parks his car like a true Italian: illegally. 
Runs towards CLARA'S APARTMENT. 
And rings the buzzer. 
No answer. 
JACK rings again. 
Still nothing. 
Shouts up at her window: 
JACK CLARA! 
150   EXT. AUTOSTRADA, CAFE- DAY                                  150 
We're at another roadside service station. 
LARRY comes out of a Kentucky Fried Chicken. 
He climbs into the passenger seat of the FORD. 
MATHILDE drives off. 
151   INT. FORD- DAY                                              151 
LARRY is dusting bread crumbs off his shirt. 
He's about to get his hands dirty and he doesn't like it. 
LARRY Not only did you not kill him, you gave him my fucking money? 
MATHILDE What else could I do? There were kids everywhere. Besides he's suspicious. 
LARRY He's paranoid. That's why I'm paying you the GDP of a small country to get close to him. You could have got him in the sack. You should have got him in the car park. Now you're going to have to take him out long range! 
MATHILDE I prefer it that way. 
She is a trained assassin. She respects JACK. 
MATHILDE The Socimi is the perfect weapon. 
LARRY Let's hope his workmanship is up to scratch. 
He slams a full magazine into the butt of a STERLING SUBMACHINE GUN. 
LARRY Sweden turned Jack into a liability. Three stiffs: two shooters and an innocent civilian. I can't afford a mistake like that again. Europol are crooked but they aren't cheap. Jack's supposed to make me money. Not run up cleaning bills. 
MATHILDE He made short work of the last guy you hired. 
LARRY Never mind Larson. He didn't stand a chance, not against someone as paranoid as Jack. The Swede was only there to take Jack's heat off you. So don't fuck this up again.

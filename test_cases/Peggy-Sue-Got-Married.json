The irony, that Santiago is beaten by the sharks, doesn't make him less of a hero. \nTHE BELL RINGS. The class begins to exit. \nGILFOND Over the weekend read the first four chapters of The Great Gatsbv. I hope you enjoy it. \nPeggy hesitates. She walks up to Gilfond. \nPEGGY Mr. Gilfond, can I talk to you? \nGILFOND Sure, Peggy Sue. What's on your mind? \nPEGGY I just wanted to tell you how much I enjoy your class. You taught me a lot and... you're a very fine teacher. \nGILFOND That's very kind of you. Thank you. \nPEGGY Thank you. Um, I also think you're underpaid. \nLUNCH AREA \nWalter, Charlie and Arthur sit at a long table. \nWALTER Why does your father take inventory on Sunday night? That's poker night. You always got out of it before. \nCHARLIE I've got to string him along for a while. It's for his own good. \nARTHUR But you're not going into his business. When're you going to tell him? \nCHARLIE Soon. I can't tall everybody everything all at once. \nPeggy, Carol and Maddy walk over and sit down with trays. Peggy deliberately avoids the empty sear next to Charlie. They're uneasy with each other. Peggy looks with disgust at the slop on the tray. \nWALTER Strange rumors are sweeping the school about you. \nPEGGY (wary) What do you mean? \nWALTER Prom what I hear, you really gave it to old Smellgrove. \nMADDY I was there. She told the creep off right to his face. \nARTHUR Atta girl, Peg. \nPEGGY Arthur, please don't call me Peg. \nARTHUR Why I oughta... \nCharlie, Walter and Arthur crack up. \nPEGGY I don't get it. \nCAROL That's because you' re not a total moron like they are. \nMADDY It's some stupid old movie thing they just started. \nWALTER That's enough out of you, little lady. \nCHARLIE I'll throw the book at you! \nARTHUR Why I oughta... \nThe boys crack up again. The girls think they're hopeless. Peggy SEES Michael Fitzsimmons, buried in a book. He looks at Peggy with a penetrating gaze, then back down. \nRichard Norvik, also sitting alone, working with a slide ruler on a book of mathematical puzzles, dressed in early Nerd. \nPeggy gets up from the table. She looks back to Charlie and the table. \nPEGGY I'll be right back. \nCAMERA TRACKS PEGGY TO RICHARD \nANOTHER ANGLE \nWALTER She's not wasting any time. Peggy Sue and Mr. Square Root? \nCHARLIE He's a nice guy. You know he's writing a book? \nWALTER Oh, a book... Excuse me for a second. (fakes gagging) \nANOTHER ANGLE \nPeggy stands over Richard.

Fishing for four\u0097eyed worms? \nPEGGY Get lost you macho shmuck. \nDoug and Richard react. \nPEGGY I have to talk to you. It's very important. \nRICHARD I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy. \nPEGGY It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please? \nRICHARD All right. I'll be in the physics lab. Make it four\u0097thirty. I have a rocket club meeting. \nINT. CLASSROOM - A FAMILY LIVING CLASS \nOn the walls are several charts: Basic Food Groups, Tips on Grooming, and prominently displayed, The Happy Home Corporation, i.e. husband as president, wife, vice\u0097president, children, employees, grandparents as board members. MISS OTTO stands by her desk. Standing in the front of the room is: \nMADDY Therefore, the key to a successful children's party can be summed up in one word \u0097 planning.. With proper planning, a successful, inexpensive happy birthday party can be had by all. Including the mother. \nShe walks back to her seat. \nMISS OTTO That was very comprehensive, Madeline. Thank you.. Now... (beat) Peggy Sue, your topic was 'How To Choose A Nursery School.' Are you prepared? \nPEGGY All.... Okay. Sure. \nPeggy walks to the front and faces the class, smiling primly. \nPEGGY Choosing a good nursery school can be one of the most important decisions you can make. It will often determine your child's attitude towards education and schooling. (proud of herself) Of course, the lessons learned are primarily social \u0097\u0097 sharing, being considerate of others. (remembering) And they're so cute when they're little. They bring you back their Little masterpieces every day and you put 'em on the refrigerator door. They're so proud, and their names are all misspelled. Scott would always print his S backwards, and Beth would make her sweet little flowers... \nPeggy wipes away a tear. At the stunned reaction of the class and Miss Otto. \nEXT. PLAYING' FIELD \nThe baseball team practices. Michael Fitzsimmons runs laps with the track team. One lone boy kicks a soccer ball. \nCLOSE - A BATON\tTWIRLING IN THE AIR \nWIDEN to INCLUDE the baton spinning down, falling into the hands of a uniformed majorette who deftly passes it through her legs and twirls it back into the air. Another baton \u0097 it rises, spinning awkwardly and falls through Peggy's hands onto the ground. Six MAJORETTES in uniform are practicing. Dolores is one of them. \nDOLORES (to Peggy) What a girl. What a twirl. You know, Peg\u0097Leggy, you're gonna get demoted to hall monitor - \nHEAD MAJORETTE Come on, Peggy Sue.. Try it again. You haven't been practicing. \nPeggy gamely tries it again and manages at least to catch the baton and continue twirling. She continues, enjoying herself. Michael runs by, the lonely long distance runner. \nEXT. PLAYING FIELD \u0097 LATER \nThe group of majorettes heads toward the school. Peggy sees Charlie leaning against the car, waving her over. \nCHARLIE Looking good out there. \nPEGGY Thanks. \nCHARLIE I noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch. I guess I deserved it. I've been thinking about my three year plan and I think it's unworkable. I must have been delirious. \nPEGGY I thought it had a lot of merit. \nCHARLIE In the abstract maybe. Get a grip on yourself! But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah... \nPEGGY Rejected, worthless, miserable. \nCHARLIE Yeah. Like that. \nPEGGY Good. \nPeggy turns, and walks away. Charlie looks miserable. \nINT. PHYSICS LAB \nPeggy enters and approaches Richard. He is too engrossed constructing an elaborate kite to notice her. \nPEGGY What a great kite. \nRICHARD I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about? \nPEGGY I want to ask you a question. (beat) Do you think...time travel is possible? \nRICHARD Are you doing some kind of science project? \nPEGGY Sort of. \nRICHARD Well... in a Newtonian framework, the possibilities were limited, but with the advent of relativity theory, the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed. \n", "test1_id": 585, "test2_input": "Peggy enters, taking a seat at the counter, startled to see Monica, who doesn't know her. \nMONICA What would you like? \nPEGGY Monica? Aren't you Monica Hines? \nMONICA Yes. Who are you? \nPEGGY Ah... never mind. Can I have a coffee, please? And a cinnamon cruller. (sotto) How's Bobo? \nPeggy notices Michael staring at her. Peggy smiles, Michael doesn't. Monica brings Peggy her coffee and donut. \nMONICA Twenty cents, please. \nPEGGY You're kidding? \nPicking up her donut and coffee, she walks over to Michael's table and sits opposite him. \nPEGGY I was impressed with what you said in English class today. \nMICHAEL Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature. \nPEGGY You don't? \nMICHAEL (contemptuously) He's a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he's the perfect American author \u0097 fat, violent, drunk... \nPEGGY Maybe you're confusing his life with his work. \nMICHAEL A writer's life is his work. Jack Kerouac doesn't have to kill a bull to have something to write about. He's out there feeling, burning... grooving on life! \nMichael leans back in his chair. He's said his piece. Peggy studies him for a beat. \nPEGGY The young man leaned back in his chair. No bulls would die today. \nMICHAEL What're you doing here anyway? \nPEGGY Coffee and a donut. \nMICHAEL I thought chicks like you traveled in packs. \nPEGGY Hey, man, I'm a hip chick. \nEXT. ART'S DONUT HOLE \nLong shot of the brightly lit donut shop. Michael and Peggy are clearly visible. \nINT.

ART'S DONUT HOLE \u0097 DOLORES'S POV: \nPeggy and Michael leave the donut shop, get on Michael's motorcycle. \nDOLORES There's Peggy with Michael Fitzsimmons. \nTERRY That commie beatnik?

STREET - NIGHT \u0097 DRIVING \nPeggy on Michael's bike, clasped around him. Her eyes closed, enjoying the wind blowing in her hair. They head out of town. \nEXT. GAS STATION \nMichael pumps gas. Peggy walks to the washrooms. Looking around she waits a beat, then enters the men's. \nINT. MEN'S WASHROOM \nWith all the aplomb of a divorcee, Peggy takes a quarter and deposits it in a condom machine. She puts the packet in her skirt pocket, pulls out the joints and stares at them for a beat. She checks her hair in the mirror and exits. \nEXT. GAS STATION \nMichael pumps air into the tires, bunched against a building. Peggy approaches him, holding up a joint, smiling conspiratorially. She lights it, inhales deeply, then passes it to him. He smiles back at her, a bit surprised, but still takes the joint and inhales. \nEXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD \n", "test2_true": "The motorcycle is parked. Peggy and Michael lie on the grass, staring down at the town lights below. Michael inhales the joint, then passes it to Peggy. \nMICHAEL This is great reefer. \nPEGGY Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old... (inhales) Travels well though. (beat) You know, the world looks a lot better from up here. \nMICHAEL The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy. \nPEGGY What are you shooting for? \nMICHAEL Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm gonna write. I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more Jell\u0097O for me, Mom.' \nPEGGY Don't you get along with your parents? \nMICHAEL The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club. \nPEGGY They care about you. They're just a different generation. \nMICHAEL Hey what's with you? I thought you were cool. You rode my bike. You blew some pot. (beat) What's your scene Miss Majorette? You gonna marry Mr. Blue Impala and graze around with all the other sheep for the rest of your life? \nPEGGY I already did that. I want to be a dancer, I want to dance. \nPeggy takes off her sweater, kicks off her shoes and begins to dance. Her eyes are closed, her body silhouetted by the moon. Michael is transfixed. After a few beats, he walks over to her. He stretches out his arms and places them around her neck. They sway together for several beats, their bodies touching. Peggy opens her eyes and sees Michael gazing at her tenderly. \nMICHAEL You know, I had you pegged all wrong. \nMichael kisses Peggy. She responds passionately. \nMICHAEL A ray of oneness piercing the solitude. Falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh. You'll be a chapter in my memoirs of desire. \nPEGGY Is that one of your poems? \nMICHAEL No, I just made that up. Do you want to hear one? \nPEGGY I'd love to. \nMICHAEL (eyes ablaze) Okay. Here's a new one. It's called Tenderness. (beat) I couldn't sleep so I thought I'd scream Betrayed by a kiss, sucking pods of bitterness. In the madhouse of Dr. Dread Razor shreds of rat puke fall On my bare arms (sees Peggy grimace; he calms down) I'm sorry. I guess I was trying to impress you. (kisses her) \nPeggy is falling for it. He fumbles with her bra straps. \nPEGGY Michael... you're as good as you looked. \nHis other hand reaches to undo her skirt. \nMICHAEL I'll respect you for eternity. (reciting tenderly) 'When you are old and gray, and full of sleep, And nodding by the fire, Take down this book, and slowly read, And dream of the soft look your eyes had once.\" (beat) I didn't write that. That's Yeats. \nPeggy is moved by the beauty of the poem. She sits up, leans over Michael, runs her hand through his hair, almost motherly. \nPEGGY I envy you. You have your whole life ahead of you and you know exactly what you want to do. (beat) But forget the rat puke; write something beautiful. \nPeggy lies back down on the ground. Michael takes her hand and kisses it. \nPEGGY You know, this isn't really happening. \nCAMERA PULLS BACK to include the entire, perfect tableau: the starry night, the motorcycle, the clouds racing across the moon and the two lovers on the mountaintop. \nEXT. STREET \u0097 DAWN \nMichael stops at the corner of Peggy's street. She gets off the bike and kisses Michael goodbye. He takes off. \nEXT. KELCHER HOUSE \nPeggy walks up the path as the MILKMAN approaches. \nMILKMAN Your parents are waiting up. You know, I see a lot of this in the spring. Good luck. \nPEGGY Thanks, Ralph. \nINT. KELCHER HOUSE \nPeggy enters, trying to be quiet. Mr. Kelcher stands in\tthe kitchen doorway in his bathrobe waiting for her, steaming. \nCAMERA TRACKS Peggy into kitchen. She grabs a cup of\tcoffee before sitting down. \nMRS. KELCHER Where have you been? \nPEGGY I went for a drive. Up in the hills. \nMR. KELCHER Damn that Charlie I \nPEGGY It's not Charlie.

The death of the garter belt! Of course, once they're manufactured they'll look better than this. What do you think? \nMR. KELCHER This is your great invention? (to Mrs. Kelcher) Would you wear those things? \nMRS. KELCHER Would they go over my girdle or under? \nPEGGY Instead of a girdle. And light as a feather. \nMRS. KELCHER. Jack, I think she's got something there. \nPEGGY And we won't just sell them in department stores. We'll market them in drug stores and supermarkets. \nMR. KELCHER That's all well and good, but we don't have the money to manufacture them. \nPEGGY You need a partner. There's a friend of mine at school whose father makes seat covers for cars, Mr. Fitzsimmons. I've invited him and his family over for dinner tomorrow night. \nMRS. KELCHER Isn't that awfully forward? \nPEGGY We've got to move fast. This is an idea whose time has come. \nMR. KELCHER You mean to tell me that you invited this Mr. Fitzsimmons over to talk about investing his money in your cockamamie idea? \nPEGGY Wrong, Dad. Your idea. \nINT. PEGGY'S BEDROOM \u0097 NIGHT \nA breeze blows through the open window Peggy sleeps fitfully, tossing off the covers. We HEAR NOISES from outside her window. A figure appears outside and silently climbs into the bedroom. Peggy mumbles Charlie's name. The man walks over to her bed as Peggy reaches out for him, tenderly, as if they were still married. \nPEGGY Charlie. I just had the strangest dream. \nCHARLIE (whispering) I have to talk to you.. \nThrough her sleep\u0097clouded eyes, Peggy begins to focus on the face of the younger Charlie. Suddenly, she remembers. \nPEGGY What are you doing here? \nCHARLIE (angry) Let's go down to the basement. \nINT. BASEMENT \nPeggy enters, flicks on the light and leads Charlie in. Peggy senses Charlie's anger, and steels herself for the inevitable confrontation. \nCHARLIE I want to know what's going on. Dolores told me that you and that scuzzball Michael Fitzsimmons... \nPEGGY I bumped into him after you dropped me off Last night. I didn't feel like going home, so we went for a ride. \nCHARLIE (furious) Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did \"Book of Love \u0097\u0097 Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance...\" I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted? \nPEGGY You know I never could stand your sarcasm. \nCHARLIE You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this. \nPEGGY And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you? \nCHARLIE Look, I've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, I got the car. I'm the lead singer, I'm the man. \nPEGGY Charlie,. I've been trying to postpone this. But what's the point? It's over. (crying) I don't want to hurt you. This is very hard for me. I'm doing this for both of us. I really want you to be happy. \nCHARLIE I will be happy if I have you. I love you. \nPEGGY That won't make any difference. We just can't live together. And you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo Janet. \nCHARLIE What are you talking about? Who's Janet? \nPEGGY I just can't trust you anymore. \nCHARLIE What about everything I said to you this afternoon... \nPEGGY That's just it. You can always get to me. There's this window in my heart and every time I leave it open, you climb in. Unless I close it now, nothing's ever going to be different! \nCHARLIE But what has to be different? \nPEGGY Everything. I have a good head for business, I should be franchising the bakery. And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. And finish. \nCHARLIE What! What about the group and my singing career? What about me? \nPEGGY I'm trying to save you years of frustration... waiting for a big break... no. Waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me. \nCHARLIE You don't know zip! You think I'm going to end up selling appliances like my father? Chasing women around the store. I've got to give it a shot. Why are you trying to kill the two things that mean the most to me? Until yesterday you loved me and you loved us. (opening the door) ) What the hell has changed? For two years I've done nothing but love you. I'll show you, I'm going to be just like Fabian! \nCharlie exits. Peggy slumps back, drained. Getting up, she crosses to the mounted swordfish. Standing on a chair she reaches into the mouth of the fish and pulls out a package of Pall Malls. She puts a cigarette in her mouth and picks up a table lighter and flicks it. As it lights, the tiny music box inside PLAYS SMOKE GETS IN YOUR EYES. \nINT. KELCHER KITCHEN - MORNING \n", "test3_true": "PEGGY (very nervous) Hello, Grandma. It's Peggy Sue. Much better. How are you? I'm very sorry about the other day. \nEXT. STREET \u0097 APPROACHING RICHARD'S HOUSE \nPeggy jogs towards Richard. He is watering the front lawn. \nPEGGY (breathless) Hi, Richard. \nRICHARD What are you doing? \nPEGGY Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging. \nRICHARD That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future? \nPEGGY Yep. It's going to be a law. (beat) I broke up with Charlie last night. \nRICHARD That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny. \nPEGGY It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time. \nRICHARD Cheer up. Now you can give some other guy a shot. Make it up to him later and buy him a yacht. \nPEGGY For God's sake, forget the money! I'm going crazy! I'm a walking anachronism. I'm a puddle of deja I'm worried about my kids, Scott must be scared to death, I think my daughter's doing drugs again. I can't have any fun here, I don't have that innocence any more. I can't keep all this in anymore. I feel Like I'm going to explode. \nRICHARD Look, the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case. May I make a suggestion? \nPEGGY Like what? \nRICHARD (excited) Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before? \nPEGGY What do you know about hypnosis? \nRICHARD Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back. \nPEGGY Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it? \nRICHARD No offense, but you're pretty out of it now. \nINT. RICHARD'S GARAGE \nPeggy sits in an old recliner. Richard holds a small, battery\u0097operated revolving disc up in front of Peggy's closed eyes, then puts it down and picks up a notepad and pen. \nRICHARD You are completely relaxed. When I count to three, you will open your eyes. One... two... three. (Peggy's eyes flutter open) We'll start with something easy. What is your name? \nPEGGY (trance\u0097like) Peggy Sue Kelcher. (beat) Or, Peggy Bodell. (beat) I'm not sure. \nRICHARD Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips? \nPEGGY Ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set... \nRICHARD What will they be made of? \nPEGGY I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that. \nRICHARD Silicon is from sand. \nPEGGY We were lying in the sand. It was my eighteenth birthday... We were so awkward... I would have married him anyway... \nPeggy starts to shift in the chair. Her shorts hike up, her legs spread slightly. This is not lost on Richard. Weird, guttural sounds begin to emanate from his throat. \nRICHARD In the future, will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her? \nPEGGY No. The Pill will change all that. Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We were just too young. \nRICHARD You mean you'll give a girl a pill and she'll want to have sex? \nPEGGY No. The Pill will be for birth control. But girls do like sex. Maybe not the first time. \nRICHARD Will you take of f your blouse? \nPEGGY Yes, every day. (taking her blouse off \u0097 getting spaced) Maybe I shouldn't have worn that dress? I told Beth it was a bad idea. That's why they made me Queen. \nPeggy's meandering makes Richard nervous. \nMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Richard, are you in there? \nRichard frantically tries to put Peggy's blouse back on. She's limp and unresponsive. \nRICHARD (shouting) No! Yes! I'll be right out, Dad. (urgent) Oh shit! Peggy, I'm going to snap you out of it. \nPEGGY I couldn't help it \u0097\u0097 I loved him. \nRICHARD One... two... three. (claps twice) You are now awake. \n", "test3_id": 587}

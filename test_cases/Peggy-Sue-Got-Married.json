Young VOICES are filtered amid a noticeable hum, hiss and crackle. We HEAR giggling and then someone named Charlie making vows of love to someone named Peggy Sue. \nCHARLIE (0.S). Hi this is Charlie and... Come on, say your name. \nPEGGY (O.S.) Peggy Sue. \nCHARLIE (O.S.) And we're here on the couch... \nPEGGY (0.S.) Don't say that... \nEXT. PEGGY'S NEIGHBORHOOD \u0097 DAY \nA split\u0097level house on a slight grade of lawn. A red Honda the driveway. \nCHARLIE (O.S.) We're here on the sofa bed... \nPEGGY (0.S.) Charlie... \nCHARLIE (O.S.) ...to record how much we love each other. Sitting beside me is the cutest majorette in the history of the world. And she would Like to say something. \nA real estate agent, a WOMAN, carries a \"For Sale\" sign to the center of the lawn and begins driving it in with a hammer. \nCHARLIE (O.S.) Come on Peggy. Say what we rehearsed. \nPEGGY (O.S.) I can't. I'm too embarrassed. \nINT. BODELL HOUSE \nMOVING VIEW, revealing the empty house. We HEAR the RECORDING LOUDER. \nCHARLIE (O.S.) But you love me don't you? \nPEGGY (0.S.) Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off. \nCHARLIE (O.S.) And nothing will ever change that. \nCharlie starts giggling. We HEAR fumbling and tickling. \nCLOSE VIEW INTO THE KITCHEN - First we see a woman's hand, on the floor. It is partially covered with flour. \nMOVING VIEW reveals PEGGY BODELL, in her early 40's, fainted from heartbreak while baking a cake. Flour is scattered on the floor. She recovers from her faint. Confused, she steadies herself and brushes the flour from her dress. \nINT. GARAGE -- DAY \nPeggy's son, SCOTT, 16, is playing an old reel to reel tape recorder. There are stacks of boxes filled with personal things and records. His sister, BETH, 23, is packing. \nSCOTT Boy, have they changed. Who gets it? \nBETH I don't know, just put it back. \nCHARLIE (O.S.) Oh, gotta go. Here's a little make\u0097out music. \nA record starts: \"You Belong to Me\" by the Duprees. \nINT. CHARLIE'S APARTMENT \nCHARLIE BODELL, early 40's, singing the same song. He can't hit a high note, turns off the water and steps out of the shower. JANET, his young, buxom girlfriend is in the bedroom. \nCHARLIE Goddamnit, I just can't hit those high notes anymore. \nJANET You know Charlie, if you're serious about this, I know a great vocal coach. \nCharlie's perplexed reaction. \nEXT. BODELL HOUSE - DAY \n\"Crazy Charlie's Discount Appliances\" truck has parked in front of the house. WORKMEN are loading boxes of records, tapes, etc. Charlie pulls up, waves to workmen. \nINT. KITCHEN/HALLWAY \nPeggy is loading the odd\u0097shaped cakes into boxes. We note the grandfather clock tolling nine. \nVIEW IN HALLWAY \nEXT. LOVIN' OVEN BAKE SHOP \nPeggy pulls up to the front door of The Lovin' Oven, her bake shop. Bags of bread and rolls lean against the door. Beth jumps out and opens the door of the shop. Peggy stacks the boxes in Beth's arms and opens the door for her. \nPEGGY If the pastries aren't here by nine thirty, call Monica and threaten her life. \nPeggy gets into the car, and blows a kiss to Beth. \nPEGGY I'll be back by noon. \nPeggy drives off as MONICA drives up. She exits her car and begins to unpack cake boxes. \nBETH Hi Monica. You just missed Mom. \nMONICA Sorry I'm late. My Bobo's back in town. \nEXT. KRISTIN'S COIFFURES HAIR SALON \nINSERT:\tSign: KRISTIN'S COIFFURES \nPeggy exits with a fifties flip. From a distance she looks like a fifties teenager. She nervously looks at her reflection. Maybe this was a mistake. Too late now. \nINT. PEGGY'S CAR \u0097 DRIVING \nPeggy is driving. On her car radio, we HEAR a local PHONE\u0097IN TALK SHOW. \nWOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.) Hi. I'm Dolores Dodge. We're taking calls today on surrogate mothers. Wombs for rent. I want to know how you feel.. \nPEGGY Oh, Dolores. \nPeggy switches stations until she finds the news. \nEXT. STREET CORNER \nPeggy stops for a red light. Her eye is caught by a Mercedes stopped next to her. Behind the wheel is a striking woman of her age, CAROL HEATH. They stare curiously for a beat, then: \nPEGGY Carol! \nCAROL Peggy Sue! \nThey pull over to the side of the road. \nEXT. SIDE OF ROAD \nExiting the cars, they hug. \nCAROL I haven't seen you in years. In all that time, haven't you at least tried another hair style? \nPeggy tries to laugh off her embarrassment. \nPEGGY 1 just did it for the reunion. I thought it would be fun. \nCAROL You're probably the only one who could carry it off. \nINT. LOVIN' OVEN \u0097 DAY \nPeggy and Carol enter as Beth finishes up with a customer. Peggy walks behind the counter as the customer exits. \nBETH Where were you? You said you'd be back at twelve. \nPEGGY This is my old friend Carol.. I told you about her. \nBeth and Carol exchange hellos. \nBETH r was worried about you  You didn't even call. You're always on my case if I don't call.. \nPEGGY How do you like my hair? \nBETH It looks great. Don't change the subject. You know how busy Saturdays are. And I can't do the icing. I always mess up the roses. You're not being very responsible. \nPeggy takes over the work of decorating the large pennant shaped cake in silver icing: 25th Reunion \u0097 Buchanan High.' \nCAROL Who's the mother around here? \nBETH Sometimes I wonder. \nINT. TELEVISION STUDIO \nA television studio set made up of platforms covered with black cloth. Placed around the platforms on different levels are projection TVs, regular TVs, microwave ovens and other expensive, futuristic appliances. Charlie sits at one of them (or a table) as a CHINESE WAITER rushes in and puts a tray of fortune cookies down. \nWAITER Here Charlie, extra fortune cookies. Good luck. \nCHARLIE Thanks. \nCharlie grabs a cookie and puts it on the table in front of him, smashing it with his fist. He picks up and reads the fortune: \nThe gym is packed with people dancing, chatting, greeting lost friends. A bar is set up at one end. On the walls are black and white blow\u0097ups of the 1960 yearbook. On a table is a buffet and Peggy' s cake. The BAND is PLAYING and SINGING old rock and roll songs. Couples slow dance, jive and stroll. \nPeggy, Beth, Maddy and Arthur enter. Beth leaves the group. \nARTHUR Hey, there's Terry and Leon. \nMADDY Peggy, would you find a table? We'll see you in a little while. \nPEGGY Okay. \nThey walk away into the crowd, leaving Peggy alone. \nINT. GYM NEAR WALL \nCL0SE VIEW \u0097 A photo of the majorettes. Peggy is in the middle, twirling her baton. \nHer reverie is interrupted by: \nRICHARD (0.S.) Are you Peggy Sue Kelcher? \nPEGGY I was once. Richard!? Richard Norvik? I didn't recognize you. \nRICHARD You look exactly the same. \nPEGGY I just did it for tonight. I don't normally dress like this. \nSHARON It's adorable. \nRICHARD Oh, I'm sorry.. Peggy Sue Kelcher, my wife Sharon. \nPEGGY Hello. Nice to meet you. Please call me Peggy. I'm Peggy Bodell now. \nRICHARD Where's Charlie?

I read about the Cordex deal in Business Week. Congratulations. \nRICHARD Thank you, Doug. \nDOUG Hi Peggy. How are you? How's Char1ie? \nINT. GYM \nVIEWS ON Carol and Walter. They play a standoffish game, each noticing the other, but pretending not to. \nWe HEAR and SEE bits of conversations: \nSANDY (gleeful) I can't believe how she let herself go. She was so beautiful in high school. \nCAROL Everyone's got a gold Rolex. I had this one specially made in platinum. \nRichard is standing with three men. They hang on his every word. Beside them, a very DRUNK MAN overhears: \nRICHARD ...fifth generation core capacities are going to cause another shake\u0097out in the smaller companies. \nDRUNK MAN (to Richard) Your damn computers put me out of business. You're a billionaire, and I'm a goddamn failure. \nAnother man gently restrains the drunk and leads him away. Richard is shaken. \nNEW VIEW \nCarol and Peggy. \nCAROL (chuckling) Welcome to the singles scene. \nPEGGY I don't know how you do it. I've never even dated anybody but Charlie. \nCAROL You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage. \nPEGGY We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things. \nCAROL So he started having affairs, and you got depressed. \nPeggy nods. \nCAROL (CONT'D.) You should have left here years ago, like I did. \nLEON Let's play \"Rate the Moment\". I give tonight an eighty\u0097seven. Better than sex, not as good as racquetball. \nINT. GYM OFFICE \nDolores has left. Walter lays out lines of cocaine on the back of the clipboard, as Carol watches. \nWALTER The best thing about being a dentist. Pure pharmaceutical grade. A couple of lines of this, I can drill my own teeth... (looks at her for a moment) Hi. \nCAROL Hi. \nINT. GYM \u0097 INTERCUT - SERIES OF SHOTS \nSERIOUS MAN (to his wife) Joe would have enjoyed this. God, I still miss him. \nMADDY (to Carol) Peggy was a mess right after they separated, but I think she's coming out of it... It seems to be pretty friendly now.. \nCAROL Sometimes it's easier when you hate them. \nGREASY DRUNK CREEP I can't remember. Did I make it with you in high school? \nLISA Doesn't it feel like it was yesterday? \nTERRY Youth is like an amputated leg. Long after it's gone, you still feel it. \nSAME BEARDED MAN My wife's a cow, my son has shit for brains, and my daughter's in India with Mother Teresa. \nWOMAN My husband's a pig. But my son's in social work and my daughter, God bless her, is in India with Mother Teresa. \nLEON For the fitness generation, we've sure got a lot of porkers. \nSANDY I don't remember anything about the seventies. \nLISA Breaking up was horrible. I said we had a very special attachment, he said, so does a Hoover. \nLEON I don't know why I came back. I hated high school. \nThe group around him all answer \"So did I\" or \"Me too.\" \nROSALIE I enjoyed it. \nINT. GYM NEAR WALL \nPeggy (loose, holding a drink) and Sharon stand in front of a PHOTO of the 1960 Cross Country Team. \nVIEW ON PHOTO - off to one side stands MICHAEL FITZSIMMONS. His hair is longer, his gaze intense and non\u0097smiling. \nSHARON Who's the one with the hair? \nPEGGY Michael Fitzsimmons. I had such a crush on him. \nCarol and Maddy join them, still panting from dancing. \nCAROL Hi, Peggy. God, that Walter Getz\tcan still dance. \nPEGGY Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left? \nCAROL Who knows. Remember... (a beat) Whatever Walter wants... \nCAROL, PEGGY AND MADDY (laughing) Walter Getz. \nPEGGY Sharon Norvik this is Carol Heath, and Maddy Nagle. My oldest and dearest friends. Sharon's married to Richard. \nCAROL Lucky lady. Hi. \nMADDY (looking at the photo) Michael Fitzsimmons! Is he here? \nPEGGY No. I asked Rosalie. She couldn't track him down. \nCAROL. Too bad. \nSHARON He must have been quite a guy. \nPEGGY He was the only one in high school I wished I'd gone to bed with. \nCAROL The only one? \nPEGGY Well, besides Charlie, of course. \nWe HOLD on the photo of Michael and... \nDISSOLVE: \nINT. GYM \u0097 LATER \nThe BAND is PLAYING AND SINGING the SONG, \"JUST BECAUSE.\" \nArthur places the gold cardboard crown on Richard's head as they shake hands. \nRICHARD Sharon and I thank you all for making us feel so welcome. It's good to be back. \nMORE APPLAUSE as Richard steps back. \nARTHUR Every king deserves a queen. Now, we had a Lot at worthwhile candidates. And I don't want any of you ladies to feel left out, 'cause you're all beautiful. But when we sent out the invitations, we didn't mention anything about this being a costume party. \nPeggy's embarrassed reaction, realizing everyone's looking at her. \nARTHUR Maybe we should have, 'cause just looking at her brings it all back for us. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you our queen, Peggy Sue Kelcher Bodell. Come on up here, Peggy Sue. \nThe band begins the song PEGGY SUE. Peggy looks pained. She doesn't move. \nCAROL They're waiting. Come on. \nPEGGY (close to tears) I can't. It's all too much. \nCAROL Go on. You can do it. \nCharlie and Beth stand together: Beth is worried about Peggy. CAMERA TRACKS Peggy as she haltingly makes her way to the stage. As she does, she notices another blow-up on the wall: \nPeggy and Charlie, as King and Queen of the 1960 prom. Arthur gives the crown to Richard who places it on Peggy's head. He kisses her cheek and stands back, beaming. \nPEGGY (into mike, overwhelmed) Thank you.. Thank you very much. \nThe lights dim, leaving Peggy in the spotlight. Continued APPLAUSE as the singer steps up to his mike and begins to SING the song PEGGY SUE. \nPEGGY ON STAGE \u0097 INTERCUT WITH HER POV \nPeople starting to clap and sing along. Carol and Carol's POV: a blow\u0097up on the wall of Carol in the senior play. Walter and. Walter's POV: a photo of Walter on the basketball team. People leaving their tables, surging towards the stage, drawn by the music. Maddy and Maddy's POV: a photo of Maddy and friends mugging for the camera in the cafeteria. Charlie talking to Carol. \nPeggy begins to cry softly. The images begin to melt together, pulsing to the music. Peggy is the focus of everyone's nostalgia. A wave of time washes over them. \nShe remains onstage, looking past the crowd to the photo of her and Charlie. \nPeggy onstage, eyes closed, swaying to the music. Walter and Carol join hands, walking towards the stage. Rosalie in her wheelchair, doing the hand jive, crying. \nThe entire crowd swaying to the music, looking to Peggy, repeating the chorus over and over. \nBeth notices her mother's state of emotion. Peggy collapses onstage. We hear SHOUTS and SCREAMS. Richard, Arthur and several others crowd over Peggy. Beth rushes to the stage, reaching out to her mother. Charlie too. \nMUSIC STOPS. \nINT. GYM - ECU A THIN TUBE FILLED WITH BLOOD INSERTED \nINTO PEGGY'S ARM - DAY \nCAMERA PULLS BACK to INCLUDE Peggy lying on a cot. She wears the same dress she had on at the reunion. She's terrified. We NEAR a smattering of background noises: NAMES are CALLED, NURSES helping, etc. Looking up she sees: The IV. \nThe NURSE taking the IV out of her arm, and placing a vial of blood on a tray with several others. Peggy sits up slowly, dazed and frightened. She looks at the nurse. \nNURSE Would you like your Twinkie now? \nPeggy takes the Twinkie, staring at it blankly. Looking around she SEES students giving blood to the Red Cross. Several have tubes in their arms. Nurses attend to them. \nCarol sits up drinking a cup of juice, waving weakly at Peggy. Maddy, now a brunette, slowly rolls down her sleeve. Arthur, Dolores, Walter and several others from the reunion. Everyone is younger but instantly recognizable.. \nCharlie walks over to Peggy. He grins at her, revealing wax vampire fangs in his mouth, hair Brylcreemed to death. \nCHARLIE I vant to suck your blood. I also vant to suck your Twinkie. \nPEGGY Charlie! Am I dead? \nCHARLIE No. You are the undead. You will live forever if you give me your Twinkie. (normal voice) Come on, let's have it. You hate them anyway. \nMechanically, Peggy hands over the Twinkie. Charlie bends over to nuzzle her neck. The nurse's hand COMES INTO FRAME and grabs Charlie by the scruff of the neck, pulling him up. \nNURSE Young man, stop that. \nThe SCHOOL BELL RINGS. \nCHARLIE Hey! I just made a deposit in your blood bank. Now I want to make a withdrawal. \nNURSE I think it's time for your next class - \nCHARLIE I'm changing banks! \nCharlie walks away towards Walter and Arthur. Peggy gazes after him, his body blocking her view of a portion of a banner hung on the wall. It reads: \"Support the Buchanan High Blood Drive...\" As Charlie exits, the final words come into view: \n\"Spring 1960.\" Peggy gasps. She begins to tremble. \nNURSE Lie back down and take a deep breath. \nPEGGY What's going on? Where am I? \nPeggy embraces her mother, holding on for dear life, inhaling her scent. \nPEGGY Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home. \nMRS. KELCHER Of course, dear. You're home now. \nPEGGY I'm home now. \nINT. PEGGY'S ROOM \nPeggy enters warily, looking around, a fifties museum of teenage artifacts. She walks around the room gently touching her old belongings including the record player from opening scene. She looks in the mirror to make sure she's still there. Suddenly, she turns around. \nPEGGY Okay, I'm alone now. Is anyone here? \nShe opens the closet door expectantly, then closes it shaking her head. \nPEGGY No. This is crazy. Is somebody going to tell me what's going on? Why me? What happened? You don't have to show up. I don't have to see you. Just send me a sign. (beat) Thanks a lot. 1 guess I'm on my own. \nNANCY, Peggy's twelve\u0097year\u0097old sister, peeks in the room. \nPEGGY Nancy! Come here. \nNancy tentatively approaches. Peggy hugs her. \nNANCY What are you doing? \nPEGGY I'm just happy to see you. \nNANCY Come on! Mom said you were sick. You're never happy to see me. \nPEGGY I'm sorry about that. I really want us to be closer. I have enough unresolved relationships in my... life. \nNANCY Teenagers are weird. And you're the weirdest. \nPEGGY Let's do something together.. Do you want to play Monopoly? Or Careers... Clue... Snakes and Ladders? \nNANCY (suspicious) Okay, what do you want? What dumb favor do you want me to do? \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nOn a small black and white TV, Dick Clark introduces a spotlight dance. Peggy and Nancy are sitting on the sofa, watching. Nancy is eating small candies, like M&M's. \nPEGGY It's unbelievable. The man never ages. \nNANCY Look at Kenny Rossi. Isn't he dreamy? I wish he'd break up with Arlene. She thinks she's so great. \nPEGGY Don't eat the red ones. \nNANCY Why not? They're my favorite. \nPEGGY They're bad for you. They cause...red lips. (red dye *2) \nNancy react, as Peggy stands. CAMERA TRACKS HER to the den. \nDEN \nPeggy opens the liquor cabinet and takes out a bottle of Scotch and a glass, noticing the family photos on the wall.. \nPEGGY Can't hurt. I'm already dead. \nShe belts down several drinks. \nNANCY (Q.S.) Peggy Sue! Hurry up. Fabian! \nPeggy steadies herself as CAMERA TRACKS her back into the living room. \nLIVING ROOM \nPeggy collapses on the naugahyde recliner. Unexpectedly, it leans back, shooting Peggy's legs up. \nMRS. KELCHER (from the kitchen) I put your laundry on your beds. Don't forget to put it away. \nNANCY What's for dinner? \nMRS. KELCHER Meatloaf. \nNANCY Yeech, not again. \nPeggy leans forward in the recliner eating the candies. Bemused, she looks at Nancy watching TV and into the kitchen where her mother is slapping together meatloaf. \nANGLE - HALLWAY - THE FRONT DOOR OPENS \nJACK KELCHER Peggy's father, enters the hallway. \nMR. KELCHER Girls? Evelyn? Who left this thing outside? \nGILFOND ...What Hemingway's saying, Michael, is that we are alone \u0097 that when we go out too far we're vulnerable. The irony, that Santiago is beaten by the sharks, doesn't make him less of a hero. \nTHE BELL RINGS. The class begins to exit. \nGILFOND Over the weekend read the first four chapters of The Great Gatsbv. I hope you enjoy it. \nPeggy hesitates. She walks up to Gilfond. \nPEGGY Mr. Gilfond, can I talk to you? \nGILFOND Sure, Peggy Sue. What's on your mind? \nPEGGY I just wanted to tell you how much I enjoy your class. You taught me a lot and... you're a very fine teacher. \nGILFOND That's very kind of you. Thank you. \nPEGGY Thank you. Um, I also think you're underpaid. \nLUNCH AREA \nWalter, Charlie and Arthur sit at a long table. \nWALTER Why does your father take inventory on Sunday night? That's poker night. You always got out of it before. \nCHARLIE I've got to string him along for a while. It's for his own good. \nARTHUR But you're not going into his business. When're you going to tell him? \nCHARLIE Soon. I can't tall everybody everything all at once. \nPeggy, Carol and Maddy walk over and sit down with trays. Peggy deliberately avoids the empty sear next to Charlie. They're uneasy with each other. Peggy looks with disgust at the slop on the tray. \nWALTER Strange rumors are sweeping the school about you. \nPEGGY (wary) What do you mean? \nWALTER Prom what I hear, you really gave it to old Smellgrove. \nMADDY I was there. She told the creep off right to his face. \nARTHUR Atta girl, Peg. \nPEGGY Arthur, please don't call me Peg. \nARTHUR Why I oughta... \nCharlie, Walter and Arthur crack up. \nPEGGY I don't get it. \nCAROL That's because you' re not a total moron like they are. \nMADDY It's some stupid old movie thing they just started. \nWALTER That's enough out of you, little lady. \nCHARLIE I'll throw the book at you! \nARTHUR Why I oughta... \nThe boys crack up again. The girls think they're hopeless. Peggy SEES Michael Fitzsimmons, buried in a book. He looks at Peggy with a penetrating gaze, then back down. \nRichard Norvik, also sitting alone, working with a slide ruler on a book of mathematical puzzles, dressed in early Nerd. \nPeggy gets up from the table. She looks back to Charlie and the table. \nPEGGY I'll be right back. \nCAMERA TRACKS PEGGY TO RICHARD \nANOTHER ANGLE \nWALTER She's not wasting any time. Peggy Sue and Mr. Square Root? \nCHARLIE He's a nice guy. You know he's writing a book? \nWALTER Oh, a book... Excuse me for a second. (fakes gagging) \nANOTHER ANGLE \nPeggy stands over Richard. He looks up nervously, pushing his glasses up the bridge of his nose, a constant habit. \nPEGGY Congratulations on the math contest, Richard. \nRICHARD It really wasn't that difficult. \nPeggy hasn't understood a word. \nRICHARD And then, there's Richard's Burrito. \nPEGGY What's that? \nRICHARD That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland. \nPEGGY I\tknow what a burrito is. \nRICHARD Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other. \nPEGGY What's inside? \nRICHARD You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes \nPEGGY So you think time travel is possible? For people? \nRICHARD Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants. \nPEGGY Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise? \nRICHARD Okay. I promise. \nPEGGY This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years. \nRICHARD You probably are crazy. Wait a minute. Is this some kind of joke? I know what you all, think of me. \nPEGGY. No. Really. You're the smartest person I know. It sounds unbelievable. But I can prove it. \nRICHARD Oh yeah? \nPEGGY You have a blind grandfather. One day you're going to invent a machine that reads books for blind people. I read about it. You're going to be famous. You're going to invent a lot of things. \nRICHARD How, did you know about my grandfather? \nPEGGY Because I'm telling you the truth. I know what's going to happen. There's going to be test tube babies and heart transplants. And an American named Neil Armstrong is going to walk on the moon. On July \nRICHARD Holy Toledo! That's six years ahead of schedule! \nEXT. STREET \nPeggy and Richard are walking, carrying their books. \nRICHARD But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it? \nPEGGY I don't know. \nOblivious, Peggy and Richard walk by Shower's Cafe. Inside, Dolores and Carol see them. \nEXT. ANOTHER STREET \u0097 APPROACHING RICHARD'S HOUSE \nRICHARD I'd be very careful if I were you. You don' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain. \nPEGGY That's why I was getting a divorce.. (beat) What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died. \nEXT. RICHARD'S DRIVEWAY \nRICHARD You look pretty good for a corpse. \nPEGGY Come on, Richard, I'm serious. \nRICHARD You're giving me the creeps. \nPEGGY Am I dead or not? \nRICHARD There's one way to find out. \nRichard stops and throws down his books. He steps in front of Peggy, throwing down her books, dragging her to the curb. \nPEGGY What're you doing? \nRICHARD Confucious says, The way out is through the door. There's a truck. There's your door. \nA large truck speeds towards them. \nRICHARD Step in front of the truck! If you're dead, it won't matter. The truck'll go right through you. Go ahead! You're dead! \nPeggy takes one step off the curb. The truck is getting closer. The truck BLOWS A LOUD SUSTAINED WAIL. \nPEGGY No! I don't want to die! \nINT. RICHARD'S GARAGE \nA completely outfitted laboratory, kites decorate the walls. \nPEGGY You know, I never could figure that one out. \nINT. BASEMENT - ANOTHER ANGLE \nMaddy, Arthur, Walter, Carol, Charlie and Peggy sit on a couch. Maddy and Carol sit in their boyfriends' laps. Peggy sits distractedly on the couch arm. They cross talk \u0097 boys to boys \u0097 girls to girls. \nMADDY I was thinking of four ushers and four bridesmaids. \nWALTER The Yanks got the hitting but the Sox got the defense. \nCAROL What are your colors, going to be? \nARTHUR I'l1 take Kubek and Richardson over Fox and Aparicio. \nMADDY I'm thinking of pink and green. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nDolores and Terry standing in a corner kissing passionately. \nMADDY (CONT'D.) Look at Dolores. What a tramp. \nCHARLIE Pitching wins pennants. The Tigers got four potential twenty game winners. \nCAROL You'd be surprised at how many girls in school aren't virgins. \nWALTER AND ARTHUR (to Carol) Like who? \nCHARLIE Don Mossi, Frank Lary, Jim Sunning and Paul Foytack. \nINT. BASEMENT \u0097 LATER \nARTHUR And now, direct from three weeks of rehearsal in Walter's garage, four guys who have dedicated their lives to becoming the greatest singing group in the world... (beat) Charlie, Walter, Leon and Terry. The Definitions. \nApplause as the group enters from the furnace room. They all wear black pants and iridescent sharkskin jackets. Charlie is in the center of the group as they position themselves. \nCHARLIE One, two, three-... \nThe group begins to SING an A CAPELLA version of RAMA LAMA DING DONG (or I WONDER WHY). Charlie sings lead, backed up by the other three. Walter dances insane, Temptation\u0097like steps. The crowd huddles around them, clapping and grooving. Peggy is on the planet of lost innocence, removed and melancholy. \nCAROL Charlie really has a great voice. \nMADDY Maybe they'll be the next Dion and the Belmonts. \nPEGGY Don't get your hopes up. \nMADDY Come on, where's your enthusiasm? \nCharlie SINGS directly to Peggy, grinning at her. In spite of herself, she smiles back at him. She's starting to realize why she fell in love with him. He's irresistible. \nPEGGY He is kind of cute, isn't he? \nCAROL Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are. \nPEGGY He does? \nThe group finishes the song. Charlie blows Peggy a kiss. The crowd APPLAUDS, including Peggy. Dolores joins Peggy, Carol and Maddy. \nDOLORES Carol and I saw you with that creep, Richard, today. \nPEGGY First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out. \nDOLORES God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends. \nPEGGY Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion. \nDOLORES Are you for real? \nPEGGY Touchy, touchy! \nDolores storms away. \nMADDY (to Peggy) I don't know what you said to her, but I wish I'd said it. \nCharlie and Walter walk over and accept \"BRAVOS\" from the girls. Walter does his James Dean imitation. \nPEGGY Charlie, what do you think of Richard Norvik? \nCHARLIE Is he gonna help you with that physics stuff? \nPEGGY He's trying. \nCHARLIE Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry? \nPEGGY (charmed) Come on, let's dance. \nPeggy enters, taking a seat at the counter, startled to see Monica, who doesn't know her. \nMONICA What would you like? \nPEGGY Monica? Aren't you Monica Hines? \nMONICA Yes. Who are you? \nPEGGY Ah... never mind. Can I have a coffee, please? And a cinnamon cruller. (sotto) How's Bobo? \nPeggy notices Michael staring at her. Peggy smiles, Michael doesn't. Monica brings Peggy her coffee and donut. \nMONICA Twenty cents, please. \nPEGGY You're kidding? \nPicking up her donut and coffee, she walks over to Michael's table and sits opposite him. \nPEGGY I was impressed with what you said in English class today. \nMICHAEL Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature. \nPEGGY You don't? \nMICHAEL (contemptuously) He's a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he's the perfect American author \u0097 fat, violent, drunk... \nPEGGY Maybe you're confusing his life with his work. \nMICHAEL A writer's life is his work. Jack Kerouac doesn't have to kill a bull to have something to write about. He's out there feeling, burning... grooving on life! \nMichael leans back in his chair. He's said his piece. Peggy studies him for a beat. \nPEGGY The young man leaned back in his chair. No bulls would die today. \nMICHAEL What're you doing here anyway? \nPEGGY Coffee and a donut. \nMICHAEL I thought chicks like you traveled in packs. \nPEGGY Hey, man, I'm a hip chick. \nEXT. ART'S DONUT HOLE \nLong shot of the brightly lit donut shop. Michael and Peggy are clearly visible. \nINT. CAR \nDolores and Terry are driving by. \nDOLORES Terry, slow down. \nTERRY Okay. \nDOLORES Terry! Slow down. \nTERRY What, why? \nEXT. ART'S DONUT HOLE \u0097 DOLORES'S POV: \nPeggy and Michael leave the donut shop, get on Michael's motorcycle. \nDOLORES There's Peggy with Michael Fitzsimmons. \nTERRY That commie beatnik? What's she doing with him? Wait'll I tell Charlie. \nDOLORES First a nerd and then a weirdo. What a bunch of nose pickers. I'll tell Charlie. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \u0097 DRIVING \nPeggy on Michael's bike, clasped around him. Her eyes closed, enjoying the wind blowing in her hair. They head out of town. \nEXT. GAS STATION \nMichael pumps gas. Peggy walks to the washrooms. Looking around she waits a beat, then enters the men's. \nINT. MEN'S WASHROOM \nWith all the aplomb of a divorcee, Peggy takes a quarter and deposits it in a condom machine. She puts the packet in her skirt pocket, pulls out the joints and stares at them for a beat. She checks her hair in the mirror and exits. \nEXT. GAS STATION \nMichael pumps air into the tires, bunched against a building. Peggy approaches him, holding up a joint, smiling conspiratorially. She lights it, inhales deeply, then passes it to him. He smiles back at her, a bit surprised, but still takes the joint and inhales. \nEXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD \nPEGGY At my age? Don't be silly. \nMR. KELCHER Thank God for that. \nPEGGY Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young? \nMR. KELCHER Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay. \nPEGGY Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please. \nMR. KELCHER All right. But this better be good. \nPEGGY I want to help with the family finances. I want you to buy some stocks. And gold. By 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce. Then you sell. \nMR. KELCHER Do you know how ridiculous you sound? First of all, it's illegal for U.S. citizens to buy gold. And in the second place, the price of gold is regulated by the government. \nPEGGY I think they're going to deregulate it. \nMR. KELCHER That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into. \nPEGGY Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands? You know, you treat Mom like a maid. It's not entirely your fault. Those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me. But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school. \nMR. KELCHER I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room! \nPEGGY Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox! \nMR. KELCHER Evelyn, take her to her room! \nPeggy stalks out of the kitchen to the front door. \nMRS. KELCHER I'm not the maid! \nPEGGY Way to go, Mom! \nThe Kelchers glare at each other~. We HEAR the DOOR SLAM. \nINT. SHOWER'S CAFE \u0097 DAY \nPeggy and Richard sit in a booth. Richard's kite is hung on a coat rack. \nRICHARD The way I see it, you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world. \nPEGGY I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here. \nRICHARD But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents? \nPEGGY I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me. \nRICHARD I'm talking about invention, no investment. I know what people think of me. Mr. Spasmatician. Dick the Square Root. I'll show them. You said I was going to be a millionaire. And you're gonna help! \nPEGGY Richard, take it easy. \nRICHARD No offense, but for a person who says she's lived an extra lifetime, you certainly are thick. Money is power.. Money makes people respect you... \nPEGGY How come you never ask me any important questions? Don't you wonder if there's going to be a nuclear war? Or a cure for cancer? What about your family? What about people? \nRICHARD I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them. \nPEGGY Give me some credit, will you? \nRICHARD Good. You're discreet. I like that in a partner. \nPEGGY Wbat're you talking about? \nRICHARD Look it's very simple. You tell me everything that hasn't been invented yet, and I'll invent it. We'll be partners. Fifty\u0097fifty. \nPEGGY Sixty\u0097forty. \nRI CHARD That's not fair. \nPEGGY Okay, find yourself another vision. \nRICHARD You're taking advantage of a minor. \nPEGGY When do we start? \nA WAITRESS approaches their table. \nWAITRESS Do you know what you want? \nRICHARD A Ton on a Bun, with fries. \nWAITRESS And you? \nPEGGY Quiche Lorraine, spinach salad and a Perrier. \nINT. LISTENING BOOTH \nPeggy sits on the chair. A turntable sits on a small desk. Record covers decorate the walls. Charlie enters and sits on the desk, his feet resting on Peggy's chair. \nPEGGY What do you know about classical music? \nCHARLIE Nothing.. Selling is selling. \nPEGGY Charlie. About last nights.. \nCHARLIE Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts. \nPEGGY But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand. \nCHARLIE Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why? \nPEGGY Why? \nCharlie cups her face in his hands, pouring out his heart. \nCHARLIE Because nothing else matters. That's the great thing about love. Every time we argue, every time something goes wrong, and I know that I'm not perfect either, things just work out better in the end. Cause you're my baby and I love you. \nPEGGY What am I going to do with you? \nCHARLIE Don't be cruel to a heart that's true. \nINT. KELCHER HAT STORE KELCHER'S HATS - LATE AFTERNOON \nAlone in the store, Mr. Kelcher is going through some receipts. Peggy enters carrying a shopping bag. \nPEGGY Hi, Dad. \nMR. KELCHER Doing some shopping? \nPeggy reaches into the shopping bag and pulls out a small wrapped box. \nMR. KELCHER For me? \nPEGGY Open it. \nHe opens the present.  Inside are a pair of miniature golf ball cufflinks. \nMR. KELCHER Sweetheart, they're beautiful. But they must've been expensive. \nAcross the street an ice cream truck pulls up. Mothers, fathers and children crowd around the back as the driver exit the cab. \nPEGGY I closed my Christmas club. \nMR. KELCHER Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank. \nPEGGY I wanted to apologize for this morning. \nMR. KELCHER It's hard to believe you're going to be eighteen. (looks out the window) Want an eskimo pie? Or a creamsicle? I'd come home from the store and there's little you running up to me. I'd give you a dime and you'd promise never to grow up. \nPEGGY Quiet today? \nMR. KELCHER This morning was good. \nPEGGY The hat business is in trouble. \nMR. KELCHER I, that what all that nonsense was about this morning? You're worried about my business? \nPEGGY Yes. \nMR. KELCHER That's very thoughtful, honey. It's just a slump. Things will pick up. \nPEGGY But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats. \nMR. KELCHER Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win. \nPEGGY (gravely; closing her eyes) He'll win. \nMR. KELCHER Richard Nixon's going to be President. Nixon wears hats. \nINT. NANCY'S ROOM \nPeggy is helping her sister Nancy with an art project. \nNANCY You think this'll cheer Dad up? \nPEGGY Of course, he'll love it. You're a terrific artist. \nWe HEAR Mr. Kelcher arguing loudly from downstairs. The two girls freeze. \nMR. KELCHER (O.S.) I don't need your charity. I don't need your grandmother's jewelry or your parents money -\u0097how could you do that? \nPeggy turns to face her parents, holding up her home\u0097made pantyhose with a flourish. \nPEGGY Ta da! Pantyhose! The death of the garter belt! Of course, once they're manufactured they'll look better than this. What do you think? \nMR. KELCHER This is your great invention? (to Mrs. Kelcher) Would you wear those things? \nMRS. KELCHER Would they go over my girdle or under? \nPEGGY Instead of a girdle. And light as a feather. \nMRS. KELCHER. Jack, I think she's got something there. \nPEGGY And we won't just sell them in department stores. We'll market them in drug stores and supermarkets. \nMR. KELCHER That's all well and good, but we don't have the money to manufacture them. \nPEGGY You need a partner. There's a friend of mine at school whose father makes seat covers for cars, Mr. Fitzsimmons. I've invited him and his family over for dinner tomorrow night. \nMRS. KELCHER Isn't that awfully forward? \nPEGGY We've got to move fast. This is an idea whose time has come. \nMR. KELCHER You mean to tell me that you invited this Mr. Fitzsimmons over to talk about investing his money in your cockamamie idea? \nPEGGY Wrong, Dad. Your idea. \nINT. PEGGY'S BEDROOM \u0097 NIGHT \nA breeze blows through the open window Peggy sleeps fitfully, tossing off the covers. We HEAR NOISES from outside her window. A figure appears outside and silently climbs into the bedroom. Peggy mumbles Charlie's name. The man walks over to her bed as Peggy reaches out for him, tenderly, as if they were still married. \nPEGGY Charlie. I just had the strangest dream. \nCHARLIE (whispering) I have to talk to you.. \nThrough her sleep\u0097clouded eyes, Peggy begins to focus on the face of the younger Charlie. Suddenly, she remembers. \nPEGGY What are you doing here? \nCHARLIE (angry) Let's go down to the basement. \nINT. BASEMENT \nPeggy enters, flicks on the light and leads Charlie in. Peggy senses Charlie's anger, and steels herself for the inevitable confrontation. \nCHARLIE I want to know what's going on. Dolores told me that you and that scuzzball Michael Fitzsimmons... \nPEGGY I bumped into him after you dropped me off Last night. I didn't feel like going home, so we went for a ride. \nCHARLIE (furious) Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did \"Book of Love \u0097\u0097 Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance...\" I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted? \nPEGGY You know I never could stand your sarcasm. \nCHARLIE You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this. \nPEGGY And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you? \nCHARLIE Look, I've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, I got the car. I'm the lead singer, I'm the man. \nPEGGY Charlie,. I've been trying to postpone this. But what's the point? It's over. (crying) I don't want to hurt you. This is very hard for me. I'm doing this for both of us. I really want you to be happy. \nCHARLIE I will be happy if I have you. I love you. \nPEGGY That won't make any difference. We just can't live together. And you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo Janet. \nCHARLIE What are you talking about? Who's Janet? \nPEGGY I just can't trust you anymore. \nCHARLIE What about everything I said to you this afternoon... \nPEGGY That's just it. You can always get to me. There's this window in my heart and every time I leave it open, you climb in. Unless I close it now, nothing's ever going to be different! \nCHARLIE But what has to be different? \nPEGGY Everything. I have a good head for business, I should be franchising the bakery. And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. And finish. \nCHARLIE What! What about the group and my singing career? What about me? \nPEGGY I'm trying to save you years of frustration... waiting for a big break... no. Waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me. \nCHARLIE You don't know zip! You think I'm going to end up selling appliances like my father? Chasing women around the store. I've got to give it a shot. Why are you trying to kill the two things that mean the most to me? Until yesterday you loved me and you loved us. (opening the door) ) What the hell has changed? For two years I've done nothing but love you. I'll show you, I'm going to be just like Fabian! \nCharlie exits. Peggy slumps back, drained. Getting up, she crosses to the mounted swordfish. Standing on a chair she reaches into the mouth of the fish and pulls out a package of Pall Malls. She puts a cigarette in her mouth and picks up a table lighter and flicks it. As it lights, the tiny music box inside PLAYS SMOKE GETS IN YOUR EYES. \nINT. KELCHER KITCHEN - MORNING \nRichard kneels on top of Peggy as she wakes up, fumbling the buttons at her breasts. Peggy comes to, as Richard jumps off. She buttons her blouse, furious. \nPEGGY Richard! You should be ashamed of yourself. \nRICHARD Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you. \nPEGGY That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back? \nRICHARD I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest. \nPEGGY God dammit! How'm I gonna got out of here? \nPeggy grabs a glass beaker and hurls it against the wall. \nRICHARD Hey! Do you have any idea how much those beakers cost? I usually charge for hypnosis. \nPEGGY Oh, go feel up your hamsters! I hear rodents put out. \nPeggy storms out. \nINT. KELCHER HOUSE \nMrs. Kelcher stands at the counter preparing a pot roast. Peggy's making a chocolate mousse. \nMRS. KELCHER You know, dear, I think the pantyhose is a wonderful idea, but the next time you come up with something, please don't stay out all night. Just tell us. We'll believe you. \nPEGGY Mom, how about a machine that's like your blender, only it slices vegetables, kneads dough, chops meat and even make fresh pasta? \nMRS KELCHER What's pasta? \nINT. KELCHER DINING ROOM \nPeggy and Mrs. Kelcher are setting the table, taking the good china out of the cabinet. A dozen red roses grace the table. \nMRS. KELCHER These roses are beautiful. And so romantic'. Who is this Michael? Is he a friend of Charlie's? \nShe moves the Jell-O mold. \nPEGGY No, just a friend of mine. I don't think he Likes Jell\u0097O. \nMRS. KELCHER What does Charlie think about that? \nPEGGY You know Mom, it's okay to have male friends. Besides, it's over with me and Charlie. \nMRS. KELCHER (shocked) What? When did it happen? Your dad and I always expected you two to get married. \nPEGGY Yeah, I know Peggy Sue gets married. Case closed. Period. Mom, if you could live your life over again, would you do the same thing? Get married and settle down after high school? \nMRS  KELCHER Of course I loved your Lather. I remember once being offered a scholarship to art school. But I turned it down. \nPEGGY Why? \nMRS. KELCHER All the college girls I knew were so well, dressed. I was worried that I wouldn't fit in. I didn't have the right clothes. I was so silly. But, I don't have many regrets, and besides, r don't have time to worry about the past. But Charlie. I hope you know what you're doing. \nINT. DINING ROOM \u0097 TWO HOURS LATER \nMichael, DORIS and ED FITZSIMMONS sit at the table with the Kelchers. They have just finished dessert. \nMR. FITZSIMMONS Moose?  I never thought I'd have moose for desert. \nThe adults laugh. Michael looks bored. \nMR. KELCHER Peggy Sue cooked the whole dinner. \nNANCY But Mom helped. \nMR. FITZSIMMONS You know, you should open a restaurant. \nPEGGY It's incredibly difficult to make money in the restaurant business. You have to get up at five in the morning to go to the market, you have problems with spoilage, employee pilferage, and just try and collect from the credit card companies. They take months to pay. \nThe whole table is astonished. \nMR. FITZSIMMONS How does a young gal like you know so much about business? \nPEGGY Oh, I just picked it up from my dad. He's a wonderful businessman. \nMR. FITZSIMMONS Really? \nPeggy gives her father a go get him look. Michael's writing in a pocket notebook. \nMR. KELCHER Ah, Ed, why don't you and I adjourn to the den for a while? \nEXT. KELCHER HOUSE \nPeggy~ and Michael stand by Michael's motorcycle, passing a cigarette. \nPEGGY But accidents can happen. \nROSALIE Not to me they don't. I'm going to win the State, then the. Nationals, and then I'm going to the Olympics. \nPEGGY Rosalie, please, listen to me! You have to stop. \nROSALIE You're sick. You should go to the nurse. I'm going to tell Miss Dennis. \nRosalie exits into the pool area. Peggy feels helpless. \nINT. HALLWAY \nPeggy walks down the hall, a set of double doors, leading to the pool, just ahead of her through them she sees Rosalie diving through the air with the careless innocence of youth. \nBurdened with the inevitability of it all, she rushes through the hall, and is stopped by Richard. \nRICHARD What's the matter? \nPEGGY It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out. \nRICHARD Not true.  I think I'm making real progress on the microchip. \nPEGGY You were meant to. You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to. I have to get out of here. \nShe starts to walk away. \nRICHARD Peggy, I believe you. I believe everything you told me. It's wonderful. You're the exception that proves the rule. \nShe kisses him on the forehead. \nPEGGY I love you too, Richard. Thanks for trying. \nShe continues down the hallway. \nEXT. AUDITORIUM - DAY \nPeggy heads out the door, sees Charlie. \nCHARLIE Hey, Peggy. Wait a minute. \nPeggy stops on the landing. Charlie joins her, so eager. He doesn't notice how distraught she is. \nCHARLIE I cut shop and did some work on your song. You know, it's not half bad for your first try. Of course, I changed all the \"yeahs\" to \"oohs\". Listen to this. \nCharlie begins to sing an R&B version of SHE LOVES YOU. \nPEGGY Forget it, it'll never work. \nCHARLIE Okay. Listen, I cancelled the tickets for Fabian. I thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant, Chez Tres. \nWalter, Arthur, Maddy and Carol watch as Peggy runs away. \nINT./EXT. BUS OR TRAIN - HIGHWAY \nINTERCUT the bus, Peggy looking out the window, the rural scenery: pastures, barns, etc., the other passengers. \nEXT. STATION \nPeggy's grandparents, ELIZABETH and BARNEY ALVORG , wait in the front of the station. \nINT. BUS \nPeggy sees her grandparents waiting for her.  She grips the window rail tightly, trying to hold herself together. \nBUS DRIVER Everybody gettin' off at Dumont. Here we are. \nPeggy stands and reaches above to take down her suitcase. Nervous, she drops it. A MAN, getting off the bus, helps her, picking it up. \nPEGGY Thank you. \nMAN No trouble at all. \nThe man gets off the bus. \nEXT. GENERAL STORE \nPeggy stands at the door of the bus, hesitant. Elizabeth and Barney approach the bus, waving and smiling up at her. \nBARNEY Hello, Lilla! \nELIZABETH Peggy Sue! \nPeggy slowly walks down the steps, moved to tears. She approaches her grandparents and drops her suitcases. She hugs them tightly. The bus door closes and the bus pulls away behind them. \nINT. CAR \u0097 DRIVING \nELIZABETH He won't tell me, but I've got my suspicions. And I don't want any of that. Don't keep her out late. \nBARNEY Let's go. \nPEGGY (hugging Elizabeth) Good\u0097bye, Grandma. \nELIZABETH Have a good time. \nBarney and Peggy open the door and exit. \nEXT. FARMHOUSE DRIVEWAY \nPeggy and Barney approach the car. \nPEGGY What does Grandma think you do at your meetings? \nBARNEY Stag movies. Smokers. \nPeggy chuckles as they get into the car. The car proceeds along the driveway and turns onto the highway. \nINT. CAR \u0097 DRIVING \nBarney is at the wheel. \nBARNEY I may be an old fool, but I think we can help you. \nPEGGY I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma. (beat) Has it ever worked before? \nBARNEY The last one was six hundred years ago. It's about time for another one. \nINT. LODGE - NIGHT \nA one\u0097story, pitch\u0097roof building. The sign over the entrance reads.: THE ORDER OF THE GOLDEN DAWN. Underneath the sign is a logo of a spreading sunrise. Peggy and Barney pull up to the front, exit the car and enter the building. \nINT. LODGE \u0097 ANTEROOM \nThirty old men are congregating around the cloak room. Most are already dressed in long, purple robes with the sunrise logo over their hearts. They either wear or carry tri\u0097corner hats. Peggy and Barney enter. Several men approach them. Peggy nervously clings to Barney' s arm. \nGEORGE Welcome, Peggy Sue. It's nice to have you with us. \nPEGGY Thank you. \nHENRY You know, you're a lucky girl. You could lay a bear trap in the aisle of the cathedral and never catch a better man than your grandfather. \nPEGGY Ah... thank you. \nBARNEY Let me take your jacket, Lilla. I've got, to get my robe. \nPeggy hands him her jacket as he heads over to the cloak, room. \nAL You know, this is very exciting for all of us. \nGEORGE We've been waiting a long time for someone like you. \nBarney rejoins them, wearing his hat and robe. The group begins to enter the main room. \nPEGGY (nervous) Do you have to wear that hat? \nBARNEY It wouldn't be a lodge without hats. \nBarney takes her hand and squeezes it. They walk slowly through the doorway. \nBARNEY Don't you worry. I'll be watching after you. \nINT. LODGE \u0097 MAIN ROOM \nA large meeting hall. The room is draped, and brightly lit with fluorescent lights. At one end sits a large, gold\u0097 painted wood throne. On either side are large candle holders, with lit candles. A small table serves as an altar in front of the platform. On a footstool is a potted plane with an artificial bird perched on its top. The throne and altar look like a set left over from a summer stock \"Macbeth\". \nPeggy and Barney enter. Several men lead Peggy away from Barney to the throne. One man places a go1den cape around her shoulders. They lead her up the platform to the throne. \nHENRY Hey, George. Get the lights. \nThe LIGHTS are DIMMED. The room is lit by the candles. \nThe men form a semi\u0097circle around Peggy. Old men at the end of their lives, they are serious and passionate about the possibilities of life beyond this world. One by one, four men from either end of the line approach the altar with offerings: a cup of wine; an egg; a gold coin; and a rose. The men rejoin the line. \nLEO COOPER, a tall, white\u0097haired man, takes two steps forward. The other men begin to sing a Gregorian chant. \nLEO (to Peggy) Are you ready, dear? \nPEGGY Yes, sir. \nLeo steps back, closes his eyes and spreads his arms. \nPEGGY Fasten your seat belts. Here we go. \nCHARLIE It opens, too. Look inside. \nPeggy opens the locket. She shivers with recognition. \nINSERT - LOCKET \nTwo photos, one of Peggy, one of Charlie, as children. \nPEGGY Scott and Beth. Where did you get these? \nCHARM E Who's Scott and Beth? Your mother gave me our picture. That's you and me. \nPEGGY So are Scott and Beth. \nPeggy leans into Charlie, throwing her arms around him, holding on for dear life. She looks up at him, their foreheads touching. \nCHARLIE (tenderly) I love you. \nPEGGY I know. \nCharlie kisses her, passionately. The locket drops to the ground. HOLD on the locket, and... \nDISSOLVE: \nEXT. ON THE HILL - LATER \nCharlie and Peggy are lying on the ground, gazing up. A flash of lightning streaks across the sky. \nCHARLIE I think we should get out of here. It's going to rain. \nPEGGY (musing) Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed? \nCHARLIE What the hell is that? \nFlying high above them is an enormous, glowing, liquid neon kite. The center of the kite inscribed in lights, flashing like a marquee: HAPPY BIRTHDAY PEGGY SUE. \nThe kite begins to descend towards them. Peggy jumps to her feet and races towards it. She grabs the tail and starts to sail away with the kite. Charlie chases after her. \nCHARLIE Peggy! Where're you going? Come back! \nPEGGY I've got to go now. \nCHARLIE But I love you. I'll love you forever. \nPEGGY I'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll love you for twenty years. \nCHARLIE Come back to me. \nPEGGY I'm trying. \nAs Charlie watches helplessly, a huge bolt of lightning strikes his car. Peggy smiles. The men from the lodge run outside. They look up and above the blazing car and see Peggy floating away. Peggy sees her grandfather in the crowd and blows him a kiss. Charlie begins to run, following the kite cord to its source. He finds Richard, struggling to restrain the runaway kite. \nCHARLIE Richard, do something! \nRICHARD I can't! It's out of control! \nSuddenly the cord breaks. Peggy floats away. \nCHARLIE Peggy! \nCharlie, Richard and the old men behold Peggy, bobbing and dipping playfully in the sky. We begin to HEAR Charlie's VOICE singing \"Peggy Sue\" O.S. Peggy looks down with wonder at the earth, and then like a comet, soars into the blackness. In an instant she becomes a star. \nFINAL SCENE \nDISSOLVE/OPTICAL \nHOSPITAL ROOM - DAY \nMoving from two to C.U. Peggy, fragments of the reunion, the cake coming towards her, fragments of words in echo effect: 'Your heart stopped for a while...\" Father's voice: 'You're a very lucky young lady...' Doctor: 'A (explain) of the head...' Mom's voice: 'But you're going to be all right now, the paramedics got there...' Mom, 'We were so worried...\" \nEchoing of, until once voice is left. Charlie. Sitting opposite her bed, as he has been every minute of her illness. He looks wan and old, worried sick, but trying to sing 'Peggy Sue' for her. \nCHARLIE (singing softly). Peggy Sue, I love you, and I need you Peggy Sue... \nPEGGY Charlie? Was I dead? \nCHARLIE I thought you were...for a while. \nPEGGY (affectionately) You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old. \nCHARLIE But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue. \nPEGGY Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you. \nCHARLIE I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you. \n", "test1_input": "Mrs. Kelcher takes an elastic band from around the faucet and hands it to Peggy as she sits at the table. Peggy makes a ponytail. \nMRS. KELCHER You're looking pretty chipper this morning. \nPEGGY I'm still here, aren't I? I may as well enjoy myself. I'm going to go to school today. (beat) Dad, I want to apologize for yesterday. The car is a classic. Use it in the best of health. \nMR. KELCHER Thank you.. I accept your apology with the hope that what went on yesterday will never happen again. \nPEGGY That would be impossible. \nMR. KELCHER You're so young, this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits. \nPEGGY Mom, is there any coffee left? \nMrs. Kelcher begins to pour the coffee, then pulls back, spilling some on Mr. Kelcher. \nMRS. KELCHER When did you start drinking coffee? \nPEGGY Oh.\tAh...recently. All the kids drink it. \nMR. KELCHER If all the kids jumped off a bridge, would you do that too? \nPEGGY I think I'm way ahead of them. \nNANCY Pass the toast, please. \nPeggy passes Nancy the toast. \nNANCY And the butter. \nPEGGY You know, you two are wonderful parents. I'm really going to try to behave myself. \nMR. KELCHER Well, at least you stopped calling me Daddy\u0097O. \nNANCY (correcting him) DADDY\u0097o. \nPEGGY Mom, sit down for a minute. This is so nice, all of us being together again like this. \nNANCY Can I tell Diane that Peggy Sue got drunk or is that a deep family secret? (silence) Well? \nMRS. KELCHER How does Diane like her braces? \nR31.NCY She hates them. Nobody likes braces. Thy just call you junkyard face and Miss Metal Mouth. I gotta go. \nNancy jumps up, grabbing her lunch on the counter, as she exits. \"GOOD\u0097BYES' all around. We HEAR a HORN HONKING outside \u0097\u0097 a five\u0097note musical phrase \u0097\u0097 BE\u0097BOP\u0097A\u0097LU\u0097BOP. \nPEGGY Oh yeah. Charlie. How am I going to handle him? \nMRS. KELCHER What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?. \nPEGGY Sort of. \nMRS. KELCHER What about? \nPEGGY The house payments. \nEXT. KELCHER HOUSE \nPeggy exits the house wincing at the sight of Charlie's car, the blue Impala she'd seen the day before. Charlie sits, one arm on the wheel, the other over the back of the seat. \nCHARLIE How do you feel? \nPEGGY Pretty strange. \nPeggy hesitates, unsure how to handle her accumulated ambivalence towards Charlie. \nCHARLIE Come on. Get in. I can take care of that. \nPeggy warily gets in. Charlie leans over to kiss her, but she pushes him away. No dice. \nPEGGY Not now, Charlie. I've got a headache. Get used to the word. Roll it around your tongue for a years. \nCHARLIE Hey, I can take a hint. You look great today. \nCharlie starts the car, burns rubber and peels out. \nPEGGY You drive like a maniac! \nCHARLIE I call this the staccato. (does tricks) \nINT. CHARLIE'S CAR \u0097 DAY - DRIVING \nCHARLIE (earnest) Not that I'm glad you were sick, but I had a chance to do some thinking last night. \nPEGGY Oh yeah? \n", "test1_true": "PEGGY Refresh my memory. \nCHARLIE How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget? \nPEGGY Maybe I blocked it out. \nCHARLIE I can understand that.. But please don't start crying again. \nEXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT \nCharlie's car pulls up. \nCHARLIE It's not going to be forever. I figure three years is long enough. I can see it the music pans out. (more tentative) And right after graduation we should start seeing other people. Kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married. Know what I mean? \nPEGGY Why wait? \nCHARLIE (surprised) Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents? \nPEGGY They'll learn to live with it. \nPeggy exits the car and heads towards the school. Charlie sits, stunned. \nEXT. HIGH SCHOOL LOT \nThey are surrounded by friends as they head into school. Near the door Walter and Leon are having a contest, hoisting themselves onto the sign pole, trying to get their bodies parallel to the ground. A crowd urges them on. We SEE taps on the bottom of Walter's shoes. \nINT. SCHOOL HALLWAY \nPeggy stands bewildered in the hallway. Charlie walks back, takes her by the hand and leads her to a locker. \nCHARLIE You're more shook up than you want to admit. You'll get used to it, we'll still see each other 2, 3 times a week. \nCharlie opens the locker. Peggy watches carefully, memorizing tho combination. He takes out a few books as Peggy notices her schedule on the locker door. \nCHARLIE Want me to drive you home later? \nPEGGY Would you? \nCHARLIE (growling) Would I?!! Why I oughta... \nUnaccountably, this cracks Charlie up. He walks away laughing. Peggy looks completely puzzled. She is surrounded by a sea of people, who say hello. She can't remember their names. \nINT. CLASSROOM - MORNING \nWe SEE Peggy, Maddy, Dolores, Arthur and Carol, singing MY COUNTRY TIS OF THEE. They all mumble, except for Peggy who delivers a stirring rendition. The class thinks she's crazy. Peggy's decided to have a good time. Announcements begin over the PA system. No one pays attention, except Peggy. \nMAN'S VOICE (V.0.) Good morning, students. This is Mr. Mosey. Our girls diving team is competing today in the county finals at Commander Beck High School. We know they'll put forth a splendid effort \u0097 so let's wish them luck. \nPEGGY Where's Rosalie Testa? \nCAROL Probably at the diving meet. \nMAN'S VOICE (V.0.) Finally, congratulations go to Richard Norvik for placing first in the Statewide Math Contest. We're proud of you, Richard....That's all, students. \nSeveral students boo Richard's name. The BELL RINGS. \nINT. ANOTHER CLASSROOM \nMaddy, Dolores and Peggy enter the room. Peggy stands at the door till most are seated. She sees an empty seat between Maddy and Dolores and, assuming it's hers, sits down. \nDOLORES Did you study for the test? \nPEGGY (horrified) Test? \nINT. CLASSROOM - TWENTY MINUTES LATER \nMR. SNELGROVE, an officious little creep, is standing by his desk. \nSNELGROVE All right, class. Time's up. \nHe walks along the aisles collecting the papers. When he gets to Peggy he picks up her blank sheet. \nSNELGROVE What's the meaning of this, Peggy Sue? \nPEGGY (patiently) Mr. Snelgrove, I happen to know that in the future, I will never have the slightest use for algebra. And I speak from experience. \nThe class gasps, a few students APPLAUD, and Mr. Snelgrove's jaw drops. \nINT. ANOTHER CLASSROOM \u0097 DAY \nMR. GILFOND is teaching The Old Man and the Sea. MICHAEL FITZSIMMONS (from reunion cross\u0097country photo) is speaking. He always wears black. \nMICHAEL Santiago comes back, with nothing \u0097 there's no meat on the bone. It's Hemingway's ego defending itself again; he's trying to prove he can still perform. \n", "test2_input": "MRS. KELCHER Peggy, do you know what a penis is? (Peggy's jaw drops) Stay away from it. \nEXT. KELCHER HOUSE \u0097 NIGHT \nCharlie pulls up to the curb, opens the glove compartment, extracts a can of Old Spice aerosol, sprays the seat; and exits his car, throwing a kiss to it as he walks up to the door. \nCLOSER VIEW \nHe's wearing a hideous orange and turquoise sweater. \nINT. KELCHER HOUSE \u0097 HALLWAY \nMr. Kelcher opens the door, Charlie enters. \nMR. KELCHER Hello, Charlie. \nCHARLIE Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store? \nMR. KELCHER Fine, thanks. Come on in. I want to talk to you. \nCAMERA TRACKS Charlie and Mr. Kelcher into the living room. Mr. Kelcher sits on his recliner, Charlie, nervous, on the couch. Nancy is on the rug, studying. \nMR. KELCHER You may have noticed that Peggy Sue's been acting a little strange lately. \nNANCY She's distorted. \nCHARLIE Yes, sir. \nMR. KELCHER She seems confused, irresponsible, overemotional. My wife says that's the way girls act sometimes. \nNANCY She's almost a juvenile delinquent. \nMr. Kelcher gives Nancy a look and points to the door. Without her father noticing, Nancy creeps up behind him and makes rabbit ears behind his head. Charlie tries hard not to laugh. Nancy continues to clown. \nCHARLIE Yes, sir. But that's what I like about her. She's not like all the other girls at school. \nMR. KELCHER Charles, in spite of your adolescent infatuation with music, we've always regarded you a a fine young man. We've trusted you with our daughter. \nCHARLIE Yes, sir. Trust is a two\u0097way street. In the past two years I've been pleased to note that you and Mrs. Kelcher have, uh, fulfilled your sacred trust of being good parents to the, uh, woman I plan to take off your hands. \nMr. Kelcher looks as if he's witnessing the latest attack of teenage weirdness. \nINT. PEGGY'S BEDROOM \nPeggy is changing a record. She sees the dress she was wearing the day before (and at the reunion) slung across a chair. As Peggy picks it up, a book of matches falls out. Peggy picks it up, excited. \nINSERT: MATCHBOOK which reads: FINISH HIGH SCHOOL IN YOUR SPARE TIME. Peggy frantically searches the dress pockets and slowly draws out two joints. She stares at them for a beat. \nPEGGY (worrying) Oh, Beth. \nThere's a knock at the door. Peggy quickly hides the joints. Mrs. Kelcher opens the door. \nMRS. KELCHER Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready? \nPEGGY For what? \nMRS. KELCHER Maddy's party. \nPEGGY I don't feel very festive. \nMRS. KELCHER You accepted an invitation, Maddy's one of your best friends, and I baked the Rice Krispie squares. \nPeggy laughs. \nMRS. KELCHER Enjoy yourself! This is the best time of your life. And the sooner you learn to handle Charlie the better. Get dressed. \nMrs. Kelcher closes the door. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nMR. KELCHER We think this party might cheer her up. Just make sure you know what's expected of you. \nCHARLIE What would that be, sir? \nMR. KELCHER Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself. \nCHARLIE (surprised) Of course. \nANGLE ON PEGGY \nwalking downstairs, surprised by Charlie and Dad talking. \nEXT. KELCHER HOUSE - NIGHT \nPeggy and Charlie exit and walk towards his car. Peggy's holding a pan of Rice Krispie squares. Charlie slips Peggy's sweater back on her shoulder. He's trying hard to make up. \n", "test2_true": "CHARLIE Great, isn't it? \nPEGGY It's really Fifties. You sort of clash with the world. \nCHARLIE Hey! What's the fun of being a teenager if you can't dress weird? And we're going to have fun tonight, right? \nPEGGY Right. I promised my mother. \nINT. CHARLIE'S CAR \u0097 NIGHT - DRIVING \nCHARLIE Is this slow enough for you? \nPEGGY (serious) Charlie, how are you? \nCHARLIE I'm fine Peggy Sue. And how are you? Are we talking on the phone? Are we pen pals? \nPEGGY Seriously. What's it like to be eighteen? \nCharlie looks thoughtful, then guns the engine. \nCHARLIE It's great. I cleaned the car, do you like it? Oh, I got tickets for Fabian on your birthday, you like him, right? He's cool. Eighteen is half of thirty six. It's \"Gentlemen start your engines\", vroom, like I'm gassed up ready for the race. I've got the girl, I've got the car, I've got the talent, but I don't know. Do I date, get married, join the army, cut a record, go to college? I got a million choices, but nobody teaches you how to choose. But it's different for a girl. You're Lucky. You just have to wait for me. \nINT. MADDY'S HOUSE \u0097 BASEMENT \nThirty kids are dancing, talking, snacking. One couple makes out. Walter, Leon, Terry and Doug Snell are crowded around a TV, watching an old western with Eugene Pallette or Edgar Buchanan. The boys laugh as Pallette or Buchanan growls a western cliche. \nDOUG Gol'darnit, dag nab it, dad burn it, dad blame it. \nINT. MADDY'S HOUSE \u0097 HALLWAY TO BASEMENT \nCharlie and Peggy are poised at the door. \nCHARLIE Here comes the life of the party. \nINT. MADDY'S HOUSE \u0097 BASEMENT \nArthur and a few others stand by the bar, where bottles of Coke are lined up. Arthur carefully pours rum from a hip flask directly into the bottles. Peggy and Charlie enter. \nLEON Goes down, smooth. Hey, look what the cat dragged in. \nCHARLIE Have no fear. Charlie's here. \nWALTER Oh, it's you is it. \nTERRY Jumping Jehosophat! \nDOUG It's a miracle! \nPEGGY Hi, guys. \nARTHUR Now that's a purty little heifer. \nCHARLIE Why Pete's the best darn cook on the Panhandle! \nPEGGY Why I oughta! \nThe boys all crack up. \nTHE PARTY \u0097 LATER \nWalter, Leon, Charlie and Terry crowd around Arthur who has an open, wide\u0097mouthed bottle of beer in his hand. \nCHARLIE Ready. Set. Go - \nArthur rapidly chug\u0097a\u0097lugs the entire beer and immediately recites from memory as the boys urge him on: \nARTHUR (going: for speed) Hi\u0097Yo Silver! A cloud of dust, a galloping horse with the speed of light, a hearty Hi-Yo Silver! The Lone Ranger! With his faithful Indian companion Tonto, the daring and resourceful Masked Rider of the Plains came to Earth with powers- and abilities far beyond those of mortal men. Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear - from out of the... \nArthur lets out a huge belch. Everybody cracks up. \nLEON You doorknob! You threw in Superman! \nCHARLIE Too bad. Close to a record. \nARTHUR (foaming at the nose) I hate it when the beer comes out my nose. \nANOTHER AREA \nPeggy, Carol and Maddy bemusedly watching the boys. \nMADDY Can you believe I want to marry that dork. \nCAROL Why do guys do such stupid things? \n", "test3_input": "MICHAEL I can dig you being uptight about Rita and Utah. That's cool. But I've got to warn you about something. \nPEGGY What? \nMICHAEL My father. He's not just the ultimate square. He's a total crook. \nINT. KELCHER KITCHEN \nMrs. Kelcher finishes the dishes, with rubber gloves on. Mr. Kelcher sits, cleaning his pipe. Peggy enters. \nPEGGY How did it go with the pantyhose? \nMR. KELCHER It's the darndest thing. Ed knew what they were immediately. As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now. \nPEGGY Oh no! \nMR. KELCHER Didn't call, them pantyhose, though. What was it, Evelyn? \nMRS. KELCHER Sheerotards. Catchy name, isn't it? Like leotards. \nPEGGY He's a liar! He has no such thing! It's my own fault. I should have had it patented first. He's a crook, damnit. \nMR. KELCHER Peggy Sue, watch your mouth. \nMRS. KELCHER Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man. \nPEGGY Oh, you're both so naive. \nMR. KELCHER Look young lady, I grew up through the depression. I fought in the second World War. Six days a week I get up and deal with the public, the bank and the bill collectors. And on the seventh day, when God rests, I don't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool! \nMRS. KELCHER You have a point, dear. \nINT. PEGGY'S ROOM \n(POSS. OMIT THIS SCENE) \nPeggy lies in bed in the darkness, her eyes wide open. The bedside clock reads: 2:47. Peggy gets out of bed. \nCAMERA TRACKS Peggy into Nancy's room. Peggy looks down at Nancy sleeping. Gently pulling back the blankets, Peggy gets into bed with her. \nEXT. CHARLIE'S STREET \u0097 MORNING \nPeggy walks down a residential street, much like her parents'. She stops when she sees Charlie's car parked in a driveway, and leans against a tree next to his car. Moments later, Charlie exits his house, a dog trailing behind him. The dog runs up to Peggy. Charlie is wary and distant. \nCHARLIE What're you doing here? \nPEGGY I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to... (pats dog) Good dog, Rusty. Good dog. \nCHARLIE Rusty's dead. That's Ajax \nCharlie throws a stick. Ajax chases it, never comes back. \nPEGGY Oh. I guess I always liked Rusty better. (beat) Could you give me a ride to school? \nCHARLIE Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while. \nPEGGY Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell.. \nCHARLIE How'd you know about that? \nPEGGY I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific. \nCHARLIE Not terrific enough. What were you doing in that part of town? Who were you with? \nPEGGY What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group. \nCHARLIE Hey. I guess there's a lot of things we don't know about each other. \nCharlie and Peggy walking. \nPEGGY I'd forgotten how much music meant to you. \nCHARLIE That's real big of you. \nPEGGY Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you. \nCHARLIE You're kidding. You wrote a song? Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why? \nPeggy takes a piece of paper from her purse. \nPEGGY Not exactly, but with your great voice, it'll be a huge hit. Honest. \nCHARLIE Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it. \nPEGGY Just take a look at it. (hands him the lyric) \n", "test3_true": "INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY \nPeggy and Charlie stand by their open locker. \nCHARLIE Does this mean you like me again? \nPEGGY It means I care about you and what happens to you. \nCHARLIE That's all I wanted to hear. 'Cause I'm never going to give up on us. It's easy to fall apart in a crisis. It's easy to be selfish and say goodbye and good luck. But this is more than love. This is a mental decision. Just wait till tomorrow, when you see your birthday present. Then you'll understand. \nCharlie walks away as Peggy reaches into the locker for her books. \nCAROL Peggy, I have to talk to you. \nPeggy turns to Carol. They walk down the hallway together. \nPEGGY What's the matter? \nCAROL It's that jerk Walter. \nPEGGY What happened? \nCAROL After Charlie told Walter that he broke up with you because he wanted to play the field, Walter decided he should do the same thing. \nPEGGY Welcome to the singles' scene. \nCAROL What a I going to do for the rest of my life? I don't have a boyfriend anymore. \nPEGGY Look, Carol, maybe Walter's done you a big favor. You always said you wanted to get out of town. Go for it. And be happy, goddamnit, I'm rooting for you. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nWalter walks up to Charlie. \nWALTER Hey Charlie, what do you think of this? \nWalter does a totally demented dance step, finishing by strumming his leg like a guitar. He stands there grinning. \nCHARLIE Walter, maybe you should be a dentist. \nINT. CLASSROOM \nPeggy sits at her desk, organizing her books. We hear the end of the ANNOUNCEMENTS over the P.A. SYSTEM. \nMR. MOSEY (V.0.) And finally, our heartiest congratulations to our girls diving team for placing second in the county finals last Friday. And a special accolade to Rosalie Testa who placed first in every one of her events. We're proud of you, Rosalie. \nEverybody turns toward Rosalie and applauds. Peggy turns to Rosalie, trembling. The BELL RINGS as the class starts to leave, still crowded around Rosalie. Peggy stares after her, frozen in her seat Dolores approaches. \nDOLORES What's the matter, princess? Lost your prince? \nPeggy looks up at Dolores and starts to seethe. She stands up slowly and faces Dolores. \nPEGGY You know Dolores, there's a lot of things I could say to you, but you're not worth the effort. \nPeggy reaches down to\tup her books. On the top of the pile is an open fountain pen, which she picks up, pul1ing the release lever, squirting ink all over Dolores's dress. Dolores drops her books, looks down at her dress, horrified. \nPEGGY Sorry. These fountain pens are so tricky. \nDOLORES (screams) Oh! You did that on purpose! I hate you. Go gargle with razor blades! \nPEGGY I beg your pardon? \nDOLORES Take a long walk on a short pier. \nPEGGY Have a nice day. \nINT. GIRLS' LOCKER ROOM \nPeggy sits disconsolate on a bench, watching the other girls changing into their swim suits. Rosalie is in the shower room, wetting down her suit. She accepts congratulations from a number of the girls. The BELL RINGS as the girls begin to exit to the pool. \nPEGGY Rosalie! Wait! \nRosalie turns at the door, smiling. They are alone. \nROSALIE What's up? \nPEGGY I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous. \nROSALIE Don't be silly, I'm the best in the county. \nPEGGY I know you are, but you have to stop. I couldn't tell you before, I didn't know if I should. But you have to stop before you hurt yourself. \nROSALIE I spend three hours a day practicing. I have trainers, I know what I'm doing. \n"}

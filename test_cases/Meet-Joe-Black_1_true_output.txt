PARRISH Will it?... 
Parrish looking around, searching for words he will not find. 
PARRISH (cont'd) Anyway, I'd like to go on but... 
He hesitates, drifts into silence. 
ALLISON (tentatively) Daddy, you could sit down if you wanted to. 
A moment. 
PARRISH There is so much I would like to say -- but I can't -- (another moment) So I better sit down.  Carry on, everybody. 
He sits, then immediately stands up again. 
PARRISH (cont'd) One other thing -- why don't we all have dinner again tomorrow night? 
ALLISON Dinner?  Again? 
SUSAN Haven't you had enough of us, Dad? 
PARRISH (with great sincerity) No. 
The word lands with effect, Susan and Allison have heard it well. 
SUSAN We'll be here. 
QUINCE You bet. 
ALLISON With bells on. 
The guests try to return to their food, Susan is the most concerned about Parrish's lapse, she does not say anything but Drew next to her senses her empathy and, in something of a display, gives her a pro forma hug.  Joe has observed every instant of Drew's performance, his anxiety is palpable when Coyle leans over to serve him, offering a tray of a roast that has been carved. 
JOE (to Coyle) I would prefer some peanut butter. 
COYLE How would you like that, sir?  On some kind of toast? 
JOE Toast?  No...just the butter. 
COYLE Right away. 
Coyle heads for the kitchen. 
SUSAN Why do you love peanut butter so much? 
JOE (intimately) I don't know. 
SUSAN I adore things like that....food I can't do without.  Don't you? 
Joe is locked on Susan, it is as if there is nobody else in the room. 
JOE Yes... 
SUSAN It comforts you, doesn't it? 
JOE (captivated) Yes...I've found that it does. 
DREW Mind if I throw up? 
PARRISH (admonishing gently) Please, Drew. 
JOE (to Susan) I'm very concerned about the woman you attended to today. 
SUSAN I am, too. 
JOE Has her pain abated? 
SUSAN We're doing what we can for her. But it doesn't look good. 
JOE I'm sorry to hear that. 
DREW Who are we talking about? 
JOE (to Susan) But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her. 
DREW Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it? 
JOE (to Drew) Susan's patient is whom we are talking about. 
SUSAN Joe visited the hospital today. 
Parrish's head swivels to Joe. 
ALLISON Did he?  That's more than we get to do. 
DREW Well, maybe next time Joe goes, he'll take us along. 
JOE Perhaps you could remind me. 
DREW I'll make a note of it.  Anything else? 
QUINCE I'd like to come, too.  See Susan strut her stuff. 
DREW You're on, Quin-cee.  Destination Hospital.  Joe, you'll be the Tour Guide.  Okay?  How's that sound to you? 
Silence.  Parrish regards Joe, then Susan, his face reflects a sudden concern with their relationship. 
JOE Susan is a wonderful doctor. 
INT. SALON, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT 
After dinner, the family and guests file back in from the dining room, Drew alongside Parrish. 
DREW I have to go, Bill -- it's been a helluva day.  Need a few minutes to sort everything out. 
PARRISH Okay, we'll see you tomorrow. 
DREW Sure. 
Drew peels off, heads for the foyer and front door, Susan follows him. 
Parrish corners Joe.

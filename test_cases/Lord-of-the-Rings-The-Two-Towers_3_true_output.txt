ARAGORN Its a long way. 
[Gimli takes a peek and then steps back.] 
GIMLI [Mumbles] Toss me. 
ARAGORN What? 
GIMLI I cannot jump the distance! Youll have to toss me! 
[Aragorn nods slowly and then turns to grab the Dwarf.] 
GIMLI Oh! [Gimli stays Aragorns hand] Dont tell the Elf. 
ARAGORN Not a word. 
[He tosses Gimli to the head of the Causeway and then leaps over.] 
GIMLI [Making quick work of killing the Uruk-hai] ARGH!! 
[On the other side of the gate] 
THÉODEN Shore up the door! 
SOLDIER 1 Make way! 
SOLDIER 2 Follow me to the barricade. 
SOLDIER 3 Watch our backs! 
SOLDIER 4 Throw another one over here! 
THÉODEN Higher! 
[Men are bracing the gate with wood and nails. Aragorn and Gimli continue to fight off the Uruk-hai just outside. Meanwhile the Uruk-hai load and fires enormous hooks over the battlements. Hundred of Uruk-hai climb onto super-ladders as they are pulled up towards the walls, the super-ladders locking onto the edge of the battlements with their steel grips. Legolas takes aim as another super-ladder is being pulled up and shoots away one of the ropes. The ladder falls back onto the Uruk-hai army.] 
SOLDIER Hold fast the gate!] 
THÉODEN [Through a crack in the gate] Gimli! Aragorn! Get out of there! 
[Legolas calls to them from the top of the battlements] 
LEGOLAS Aragorn! [He throws them a rope] 
[Aragorn grabs Gimli in one hand and the rope with the other as they are pulled up the wall. Just then the Uruk-hai load and fires enormous hooks over the battlements. Hundred of Uruk-hai climb onto super-ladders as they are pulled up towards the walls, the super-ladders locking onto the edge of the battlements with their steel grips. Legolas takes aim as another super-ladder is being pulled up and shoots away one of the ropes. The ladder falls back onto the Uruk-hai army.] 
THÉODEN Pull everybody back! Pull them back! 
GAMLING Fall back! Fall back! 
THÉODEN Theyve broken through! The castle is breached. Retreat! 
GAMLING Fall back! 
THÉODEN Retreat!

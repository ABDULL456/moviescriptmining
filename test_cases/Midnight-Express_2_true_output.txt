DAYLIGHT! 
BILLY squints.  Adjusting to the harsh sensation. 
AN ISTANBUL STREET - TRAFFIC, SOUNDS.  TWO GUARDS approaching the portal in the distance, drinking soda pop. 
BILLY steps back, straightens his clothes, steps out briskly and at such an angle that 
THE TWO GUARDS don't notice him in the traffic  as they enter the open portal. 
LONG SHOT - BILLY walking down the street, looking back, almost bewildered, not quiet believing this. 
CUT: 
TIGHT - RAILROAD TICKET being stamped.  SOUND - SNAP. MOVE UP to TICKET CLERK behind a grill. 
VOICE (OFF) Edirne to Uzun Kopru? 
THE CLERK looks puzzled. 
BILLY is on the other side of the grill.  A ill-fitting new Western style suit, a hat over his dyed black hair; totally paranoid. He hasn't slept in three days and the bruises from the Hamidou beating now show clearly black and blue on his face. His eyes are alert, darting around, his speech clipped and to the point. 
BILLY What's the matter? 
THE CLEF!!  Shrugs. 
CLERK 'What are you crazy? There's no train anymore to Uzun Kopru, it'd have to go through Greece. The border's closed. 
BILLY taken by surprise. 
BILLY No train? 
CLERK (OFF) No more train. 
BILLY Moves off a small provincial RAILROAD DEPOT - DAY. He looks at the: 
EMPTY TRACKS - No 'midnight express'. 
CUT: 
BILLY, tenser than ever, uses the occasion of buying a newspaper at an OUTDOOR STAND to study: 
THE MAIN SQUARE of the VILLAGE (EDIRNE) - DAY. SOLDIERS and POLICE are abundant, chattering bustling amid tanks and half-tracks.  Mountains can be seen in the far distance. 
BILLY camouflages his face as best he can in the Newspaper "Hurriyet" studying: 
CABDRIVERS in the Main Square.  Most of them are older, grizzled looking standing next to their old battered dusty cabs talking with stray SOLDIERS. Billy's eyes settle on a YOUNGER DRIVER with longish hair, possibly an ally. 
BILLY glances down at his newspaper as a SOLDIER intersects and his expression goes stony as he sees: 
FULL COLOR DRAWING (first page) of a ridiculously fierce heavy-muscled barechested MAN beating a facsimile of Hamidou into the ground.  Next to it a blurry badly reproduced photograph of BILLY with a superimposed GUN in his hand. You can't really tell it's him. 
BILLY, controlling himself, crumples up the newspaper into a baton, his eyes everywhere.  Be the darting A crosses square. 
ANOTHER ANGLE - BILLY, intersecting a POLICEMAN who glances at him, joins the YOUNG CABDRIVER.. 
BILLY Listen, I have Swedish friends camping south of the town. I was supposed to meet them here this morning but I was late. Can you take me there? 
DRIVER looks at him neutral. 
DRIVER You know where they are? 
BILLY (anxious to get in the cab) Sure. 
DRIVER How far? 
BILLY (impatient) About ten kilometers. 
DRIVER Sixty Lira? 
BILLY (surprised) Sixty? 
Billy eyes: 
APPROACHING SOLDIERS. 
BILLY (OFF) Okay. 
THE DRIVER, noticing Billy's look at the soldiers, gets in the cab. 
BILLY climbs into the back seat, feeling already he has made a mistake. There is something too alert, too hard in this young driver. 
CUT: 
BILLY P.O.V. - THE MOUNTAINS as they roll in the taxi. FORESTS - FIELDS. 
INTERIOR TAXI

Cocky bastard... ANGLE ON TREVOR 
As he wins a fight. ANGLE ON DREW As he wins. ANGLE ON TREVOR Drew watching, as he wins again. DREW AGAIN Winning. The stage is set for the finals. ANGLE ON THE RING Drew and Trevor are already inside, waiting. Drew fights in a mish mosh of gear (different colors, different makes), while Trevor is decked out in designer, personalized gear.

ANGLE ON TREVOR'S CORNER 
Where he is given mineral water to drink, his shoulders are massaged, etc. 
ANGLE ON DREW'S CORNER 
Kwan sheepishly offers him a sip of water from a battered paper cup. 
2nd round: Drew's getting beaten worse than the first round. Nothing he tries works. The score at the end of the round is 15 - 4, in favor of Trevor. ROUNDBREAK 
Drew is exhausted, frustrated and worried. Trevor is pumped and ready to go on forever. KWAN You only lose if you give up. 
ANGLE ON TREVOR'S CORNER The psychologist is exhorting him to destroy Drew. Trevor leans back on his padded stool, smiling. The 3rd round starts. In this round, Trevor is destroying Drew, making him look ridiculous. A clinch comes, and (INSERT HERE) before they can break, Trevor grabs the drawstring 
around Drew's waist and pulls. They face off ("20 seconds" comes the call), and Trevor charges. As Drew blocks, his pants begin to sag. Trevor, not trying to score, just trying to keep Drew's hands busy, keeps coming. Drew's pants drop lower and lower. When they get around his knees, he finally notices them, and reaches down to get them. Trevor drives and picks him up in a throw, effectively showing Drew's bare ass to the world. CUT AWAY to crowd laughing, girls shocked, cameras poised and recording, one mom puts her hands over her daughter's eyes, etc. Trevor dumps Drew and scores the final point, just as time runs out. A buzzer goes off, signaling the end of the round. Trevor thrusts his fists into the air in celebration. Drew tries to crawl out of the ring, and everyone is watching him.

ANGLE ON TREVOR 
As he is being interviewed by tv reporters. 
TREVOR 
I was never worried. He's no match for me. I just hope the 2nd place trophy is a belt! 
Crowd laughs, Trevor's entourage laughs the hardest. 
ANGLE ON DREW 
As he packs up his stuff. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. NEW YORK BRIDGE ­ NIGHT 
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW AND KWAN WALKING ALONG A BRIDGE, THE ENTIRE NEW YORK NIGHT SKYLINE IN THE B.G. They are not talking, they are just walking, Drew kicking a can and contemplating the future, and the past. INT. KWAN HOUSE ­ SAME NIGHT 
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF SMOKING ACUPUNCTURE NEEDLE, ITS TIP EMBEDDED IN DREW'S FOREARM. 
Kwan's hand COMES INTO FRAME and flicks the needle, sending it vibrating back and forth. CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL Drew sitting at the table in Kwan's house, the acupuncture needle in his arm and his face pensive and sad. Kwan busies himself around the needle, trying to alleviate the pain of Drew's bruises. KWAN 
Next time we get that guy... DREW (shaking his head) No next time, Master. Maybe... (big sigh) ... you should find a new student. I just can't do it ­ I'm not getting any better! KWAN (CONT'D) Don't talk like that. At Shaolin... He pauses, and decides not to tell another Shaolin Temple story. Drew looks at him funny ­ this is very against his character. 
KWAN (CONT'D) 
I saw a Shaolin monk once. I was only 5 years old at the time, but I remember it like it was yesterday. I was coming back from the market with my father. Soldiers stopped us and were taking the food we had just bought. It was all we had left to eat ­ no more money. These were hard times in China, people were selling their children for food, and the soldiers had no right. Who can stop soldiers with guns, though? Yes? 
He pauses, and takes a sip of tea, checking the needle, adjusting it and turning it slightly this way and that. 
KWAN (CONT'D) 
Just as the soldiers were leaving, a monk stepped out of the crowd and told them very calmly to put the food back. Well, naturally, they didn't. They pushed the monk, and the next thing I knew the soldiers were in the street, and the food was back in my father's arms. 5 soldiers, and they were in a heap on the ground, their blood mixing with the dust of the street. 
Kwan smiles with the memory ­ it is a sweet and heroic one. KWAN (CONT'D) The crowd whispered "Shaolin", and he bowed to us, touched my cheek and smiled, then just walked on. I watched him until he disappeared in the distance. He was larger than life, a hero to a little boy of 5. I vowed then and there to become like him, fight for right like the Shaolin. He pauses again, looking at Drew. Drew meets his gaze, wondering why he is telling him this story. 
KWAN (CONT'D) I never did, though. My family left China and ended up here in New York, a young boy's dream left behind in

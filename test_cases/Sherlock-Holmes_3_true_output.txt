The sun is rising.   Holmes' eyes open and we see: 
WATSON -- or some deathly version of his old friend -- is sitting in the chair where Blackwood appeared. 
HOLMES (confused) Watson...? 
Watson leans closer, into the light. A ghost or a man? He gestures towards the diagram on the floor. 
WATSON Interesting artwork.   You look bloody awful. 
He writes something in his notebook. He is decidedly alive, but with burn flashes, cuts and bruises. His arm is in a sling. He's been through it. 
In the b.g. Irene is at the fire heating some coffee. 
HOLMES What about the shrapnel in your arm? 
Watson shows him a piece of shrapnel -- 
WATSON Took it out myself. Mary said I had a lousy doctor. 
-- then tosses it away. 
They both smile.   United in agony. 
HOLMES (quietly, between them) She brought you here? 
WATSON Yes, oddly, it seems she might understand the power of partnership. 
They both look back over to Irene who just finished loading her gun. The coffee seems ready so she pours a cup.

98   CONTINUED:                                                  98 HOLMES The fair sex was always your department, Watson. 
Irene walks over and hands Holmes the cup. 
HOLMES Thank you. You know, I dreamt that you were strangling me. 
IRENE I was... I had to get you to pass out to settle down. 
They smile at their unique, twisted understanding of one another. 
HOLMES What time is it? 
WATSON It's half past nine. 
Holmes takes a drink of coffee. 
HOLMES Excellent brew, but I believe my head requires something a bit stronger to clear the -- 
WATSON I brought you this... 
HOLMES Exactly. 
(CONTINUED) 
98   CONTINUED: (2)                                                   98 
He hands Holmes his VIOLIN.     Holmes takes it.

Watson and Irene sit at a table, the SCREECH of a fiddle now comes from upstairs. 
The fiddler's owner -- from the pub's band -- is busy getting drunk with the money he has acquired. 
Irene arrives with two pints, puts one down in front of him, sits opposite him with the other. 
Watson looks from Irene to the pint with open suspicion. Could it be poisoned? He wouldn't put it past her. But then he decides that's absurd. He takes a sip. 
IRENE Oh, I poisoned that one. 
WATSON With your own venom no doubt. 
IRENE Better a snake than a lap dog. 
WATSON There's a new field in the treatment of abnormal personalities -- it's called psychology. It appears you're what's considered a para-neurotic deviant with anti-social proclivities. Quite severe. And untreatable. 
IRENE No, doctor, I'm simply a woman. (beat) (MORE)

ALTERNATE DIALOGUE: 
IRENE (alternate dialogue) Not quite, doctor. Let me make it simple for you, with a lot fewer words -- I'm what's called a woman. (beat) Understand that, and you'll have a happy marriage.

as he plays the violin, but not with a bow. He plucks it, he strums it, he makes strange atonal sounds, as he STARES AT THE RITUAL PATTERN he's laid out on the floor. 
Flashes to various images of the sphinx that he's observed over the course of the investigation. 
He stands up and draws a sphinx in charcoal on the floor. Then he moves to the ox bone -- a flash of Sir Thomas' ring with the Ox crest. He draws an ox in charcoal. Next to the ox bone Holmes writes -- Sir Thomas -- OX ring. 
Next, he moves to the feather -- a flash to an Eagle in flight -- he quickly sketches an eagle. Then to an American flag, then to Standish with his eagle-topped cane. Next to the feather he writes America. 
Then he moves to the hair. He draws a man's face. Flash to Reordon's red hair. Next to it Holmes writes Man.

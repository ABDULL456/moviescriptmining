Linda starts quietly weeping. 
This focuses Harry's attention.    He looks at her as if just now noticing her. 
HARRY (CONT'D) ... What?    What's wrong, baby? 
LINDA It can't always come from me, Harry! I'm not that strong! 
Harry moves next to her and puts an arm around her. 
HARRY What's wrong, baby?     Harry's here. 
LINDA You're not here for me! I need a can- do person! You're all... defeated! 
HARRY I'm sorry, baby---- 
LINDA Chad is the only can-do person I know and he's gone, Harry, he's gone. 
HARRY I'll be good. I'll be better.     I just need to exercise. Are there pedestrian paths around here? 
He squeezes her shoulder, takes a gulp of the drink. 
HARRY (CONT'D) ... Who the fuck is Chad? 
LINDA Could you help me find him?  He's a friend from work. You know law enforcement people, right? You could call, unofficially? 
HARRY Wait a minute, what's his name?   What happened? 
LINDA Chad Feldheimer. He just disappeared. He hasn't been at work or at home for two days. 
HARRY Okay. 
LINDA He---- 
HARRY You know his social security number? 
LINDA Huh?     NO!    I---- 
HARRY It's okay. That's okay.     What's the last place you saw him? 
LINDA (snuffling) I don't know! He just disappeared! The last place I saw him was the Jamba Juice on K Street. And he's gone. 
Harry squeezes her shoulder again. 
HARRY Okay baby. We'll find your friend. Missing person. Piece of cake. 
133   INT. PEDIATRIC EXAM ROOM - DAY                                      133 
AN EPIGLOTTIS 
Illuminated by a small light. It quavers.       The tongue starts to rise and the mouth starts to close. 
WOMAN'S VOICE No, stay open... 
Wider: a pediatric examining room decorated with colorful prints of cartoon characters and clowns. 
Katie Cox, in a white smock, has a tongue depressor in a five- year-old's mouth and a light-sight in one hand. She withdraws both as the child finishes closing his mouth. The child's mother stands by. 
Katie grasps the child by the upper arm. 
WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D) ... You have to let the doctor look in your mouth. 
The child keeps his lips pressed together. 
WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D) ... Now you listen to me, young man. You do as I say or I'll ask your mother to leave the doctor's office and the two of us will sort out what's what. 
The child looks at her fearfully. 
The wall phone bleeps. 
Katie rolls to it on her castored chair. 
WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D) ... Yes. 
She listens briefly. 
WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D) ... With a patient. 
She hangs up. 
134   INT. OSBOURNE'S BOAT - DAY                                          134 
Osbourne, in dressing gown and pyjamas, is barking into the phone: 
OSBOURNE Yeah? The same patient she's been with since YESTERDAY? BullSHIT! 
FILTERED VOICE Dr. Cox has suggested you call her attorney---- 
OSBOURNE Yeah, RIGHT! Tell her I got the new fucking keys! 
He slams down the phone. 
135   EXT. BOAT DECK                                                  135 
The hatch is thrown open and Osbourne emerges from below. There is a large built-in toolbox just by the hatch. He yanks it open and pulls out a hatchet. 
OSBOURNE New keys...

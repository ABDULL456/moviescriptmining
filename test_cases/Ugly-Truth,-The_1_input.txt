MIKE (acting old) "My name's Abby and I'm arthritic and alone. I have eighteen cats who keep me company." 
ABBY (sarcastic) Oh, ha ha. That's very funny. (pretending to be Mike) "Are you wearing underwear?" 
She grabs his ass. 
MIKE Come on! I wouldn't say that and I wouldn't grab ass.

ABBY (still as Mike) "Hey babe, what's wrong with a little ass grabbing?" (continuing to pinch his ass) "I mean what's the point of you even having one unless it's there for me to grab it? You're just a set of orifices and a pair of tee- tas." 
MIKE You're a deeply, deeply disturbed person. 
Switching tactics, Abby slips into seductress mode, tracing her finger up and down his arm. 
ABBY Maybe I'm just a good student. 
MIKE Would you stop doing that? 
ABBY Doing what? 
MIKE Touching me with your finger. 
She seductively leans into him. 
ABBY Why? Am I turning you on? 
MIKE Maybe. 
She gives him a look. 
ABBY Actually, I kind of like it. 
MIKE Really... 
She leans in closer. 
ABBY Sucker. 
He shoves her away.

MIKE No teaching the teacher. 
Just then, the doorbell RINGS. 
ABBY Who is it? 
COLIN (O.S.) It's Colin. 
ABBY Oh my God! 
MIKE Told you he'd drop by. 
ABBY (panicking) I'm not ready for this. Am I? I'm not. 
MIKE Calm down. Keep the conversation under a minute. Be mysterious. Keep him guessing. 
Mike leaps over the couch and hides. As Abby walks over to the door and opens it. Colin stands there. 
ABBY Oh. Hey. 
COLIN Hi. Wow, you look great. 
ABBY Thanks. 
COLIN What happened to you today? 
ABBY What do you mean? 
COLIN You put me on hold and didn't call me back. 
ABBY That was you? I'm so sorry. (steering him to the door) (MORE)

She hustles him out the door. 
ABBY (CONT'D) Bye. 
Colin bangs on the door. 
COLIN (0.S.) Abby wait... 
Mike pops up from under the couch. He gives her the thumbs up. 
ABBY (whispering) Now what? 
MIKE Make him suffer.

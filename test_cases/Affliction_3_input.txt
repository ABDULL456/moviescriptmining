Wade stands in darkness. The only sound his idling truck, the wind. Then a third sound -- the snap of ice. Ice cracks ripple from the middle of the pond. Ice planes tip around the truck. 
LaRiviere's snazzy Dodge slips, descends, disappears. 
Headlights glow under water, then go out. "Our Business Is Going In The Hole." 
Wade, alone in darkness, plops into the water, paddles to shore. Freezing, he finds Jack's tire tracks in the snow. He bangs his jaw. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. WICKHAM'S - NIGHT 
A car drops Wade off. "Home Made Cooking." 
CUT TO: 
INT. WICKHAM'S - NIGHT 
Wade enters the empty diner. His clothes frozen. 
NICK Your father's in back, Wade. Marg had to babysit him. She moved in with you, huh? (looking closer) What happened? 
Wade goes to the kitchen. Glen Whitehouse, washing dishes with Margie, looks up: 
POP Ah, the prodigal son. 
NICK About fucking time. 
POP Look, got me a new job, second cook and bottle washer! 
MARGIE What happened? 
WADE Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry. 
POP The fuck you got waylaid. You follow your prick around like it was your nose. 
NICK (enters) Can it, Whitehouse. (to Wade) Get him out of here. It was funny at first, but I'm tired. 
MARGIE There's clothes in the back. 
Wade's old man talks as he dresses: 
POP Let's go home? What home is that? Your home? My home? Let's have a talk about that. You're fucking sly, Wade. Your mother's dead so she can't make any excuses for you anymore! You gotta deal with me! No more sugar tit, asshole. 
Wade, redressed, enters: 
WADE Pop, for Christ's sake! 
POP You think you can take me now? Come on, try. 
Margie and Nick guide pere et fils to MARG'S CAR. Nick speaks to her: 
NICK Marg, get out of this. Fast. 
MARGIE I can't. 
Marg drives off.

Hair Dresser 1 [Brushing and combing Mulan's hair much to Mulan's chagrin]: Wait and see When we're through 
Hair Dresser 2: Boys will gladly go to war for you 
Hair Dresser 1: With good fortune 
Hair Dresser 2 [Finalizing the hairdo to look exactly like hers]: And a great hairdo 
Both: You'll bring honor to us all 
Fa Li and others:  [Mulan following her Mother passes a xiangqi game and pauses to make an impressive move.  Mulan has a smug look on her face when Fa Li comes back and drags Mulan away] A girl can bring her family Great honor in one way By striking a good match And this could be the day 
Dresser 1 [Dresser 1, Dresser 2, and Fa Li dress Mulan]: Men want girls with good taste 
Dresser 2: Calm 
Fa Li: Obedient 
Dresser 1: Who work fast-paced 
Fa Li: With good breeding 
Dresser 2 [Pulling the dress tight around her waist]: And a tiny waist 
Mulan [expressing her waist being squeezed tight] [spoken]: huh. 
All Three: You'll bring honor to us all 
Chorus:  [Mulan follows Fa Li and sees boy stealing a doll from a girl.  Mulan grabs the doll from the boy and returns it to its owner] We all must serve our Emperor Who guards us from the Huns A man by bearing arms A girl by bearing sons 
Make-up Lady/Fa Li: [Putting on Mulan's face, powder, lipstick and eye liner] [in a 3 person round] When we're through you can't fail Like a lotus blossom soft and pale How could any fellow say "No sale" You'll bring honor to us all [Make-Up Lady holds a mirror so Mulan can see her reflection.  Not looking pleased, Mulan takes her single, short bang and brings it down in front of her forehead and smiles] 
Fa Li [spoken. Fa Li places a hair comb in Mulan's hair]:  There, you're ready.

(IN THAI) Skylight bar at the Jupiter.. Every night. Chang studies Li Po making sure he speaks the truth... then nods. 
CHANG 
(IN THAI) I'm taking your phone. Chang turns to leave. 
LI PO 
(IN THAI) What about me? Beat. Chang considers. Looks at Pan who's staring at Chang in fear. Looks back at Li Po. 
CHANG 
(IN THAI) I forgive you... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THE JUPITER - NIGHT 
A people carrier pulls up outside the hotel. The doormen open the side door and step back when they see the heavily armed and bloodstained policemen get out, led by Chang. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SKYLIGHT BAR - NIGHT 
PICK OUT Dimitri and the group of Russian Criminals. Yuri Karkov is in the centre of them, a girl on either arm. Chang leads the Cops into the bar. He fires two shots into the ceiling. That shuts everyone up and gets the Russian Criminals up and ready for a confrontation. Half the bar's emptied by the time Chang reaches Yuri Karkov. 
YURI You better have a fucking good reason for doing this. Don't you know who you're fucking with. Chang looks at him. 
CHANG 
(IN THAI) You live in my country. Can't speak my language... Too bad the one guy on my team that could speak English got murdered today. Yuri looks round for help. He can't understand a word. 
YURI Can someone tell me what the fuck this guy's trying to say... Chang calls over to the barman. 
CHANG 
(IN THAI) Can you turn the music off. It won't be long, I promise. The music's killed. 
CHANG (CONT'D) 
(IN THAI) That's better. Thank you very much... Chang pulls out Li Po's distinctive mobile phone. Dimitri, currently flanking Yuri, turns white. Chang calls a number. A beat. Then a phone starts ringing in Dimitri's jacket pocket (with a really cheesy ringtone). Dimitri winces. Chang shakes his head. Yuri pulls a gun. Kim shoots him dead. Chang moves his gun across to Dimitri. Holds his mobile phone up to his ear. Dimitri answers. Chang speaks through the phone. 
CHANG (CONT'D) 
(IN ENGLISH) You're under arrest... 
CUT TO: 
INT. SKYLIGHT BAR - LATER 
WE TRACK IN on Dimitri as he stares at Chang, a rabbit in the headlights. Chang slowly sits down next to him. Talks to him in English. 
CHANG (CONT'D) I need information. Phaiban spins a spotlight onto Dimitri. 
CHANG (CONT'D) And you're going to help me. Suddenly the atmosphere in the emptied club shifts. It's as if Dimitri and Chang are locked into some kind of surreal performance... 
CHANG (CONT'D) Whether you like it or not. Dimitri's body starts to shake in fear. 
DIMITRI It was an English woman - she wanted you dead... A beat. Not what Chang expected... 
CHANG Why? 
DIMITRI Said you... murdered her son.... 
CHANG Who was she?

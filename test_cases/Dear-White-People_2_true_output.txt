21   INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER - DAY                                21 
Lionel steps his way through the hall, a deer in headlights with a notepad. He flips through Sam's "EBONY & IVY" book... 
SAM (V.O.) The Armstrong / Parker dining hall is the epicenter of Black culture as it stands at Manchester. Only here can you commiserate, celebrate and discuss everything from Kanye West lyrics to theoretical relativism all in one sitting. Not to mention find someone who can actually do your hair. 
ARMSTRONG / PARKER DINING HALL - CONTINUOUS 
Lionel enters and takes a place in a line. He absorbs this lively and somewhat alien dining hall. 
Troy now holds court near the windows at a table of eight or so friends including Martin and SUNGMI, a lip ringed Korean art major. 
MARTIN "We wuz robbed." That election was suspect man. 
Martin glares at Reggie and his giant souped-up Laptop. Sam breaks this by sitting back down - her phone call ending. 
SAM You call me the minute there's an update. Love you too mom. 
Sam hangs up. The call's really put her in a bad place. She sits at a table of her Bofros - who we'll name by their hair. 
CURLS There is one other sister in my Relativity class, I'll be damned if our professor doesn't call me Laretta every God damn time. 
DREADS We all look the same. 
REGGIE Programming professor gets me and Martin here mixed up constantly. 
MARTIN You should be so lucky. 
Reggie glances over at Martin's Mac Air. 
REGGIE Cute. You get that at Toys R Us? 
Sam pulls out her Mac and her student ID card. 
REGGIE (CONT'D) You still using your ID number? 
SAM I always forget passwords. 
REGGIE You are begging to get hacked. 
SAM Good thing the one evil techno- genius thinking like that is on my side. 
Sam pushes aside all the paperwork on her table. 
SAM (CONT'D) So this is what the revolution looks like? Office hours and paperwork. 
Sam pulls her camera out - starts to shoot the room. 
REGGIE Winning was a happy accident. We want the reform repealed right? 
CURLS Means to an end, sister. 
Sam feels the heat of her disciples' eyes on her as the topic of the day rages on with the entrance of Coco, who sits with a group of well manicured hot-ironed group of girls, white and Black. 
COCO The talented tenth always has to bust its ass a little bit harder, but I don't see the benefit in blaming white folks for everything. 
CURLS Who's blaming? 
TROY I don't see the issue. I never had one. Never ran into any lynch mobs. 
Lionel takes a seat alone facing the action. 
Kurt and crew enter with plates of mac and cheese and sit in the heart of the conversation. Lionel avoids eye contact. 
SAM Lynch mob is still there. Just re- branded itself. 
TROY As what pray tell? 
REGGIE The Republican party. 
SAM Want to know how this world sees you? Go to a Young Republican's meeting and bring up Welfare. 
SUNGMI Or Immigration. 
LIONEL (aside) Or gay equality. 
KURT Bullshit. 
MARTIN I agree. Got something to add?

PROFESSOR (O.S.) Just broken down from seeing the suffering of my patients. 
GRAMMA FRANCIS Don't get my hair. 
INT. HELLER HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT - 6 YEARS EARLIER 
Fully clothed, Glenda is passed out on the bed. Framed family portraits sit on the mantle. 
PROFESSOR (O.S.) ...As a result, I began to suffer. Not just in my work but emotionally and physically...spiritually... Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 28. 
INT. HELLER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - 6 YEARS EARLIER 
Shirt off, hand stuffed into his underwear - Jerry holds a remote and flicks through channels. Nothing holds. 
PROFESSOR (O.S.) ...There's a choice we all have to make in the medical profession - whether to be sympathetic or empathetic with our patients... 
INT. HELLER HOME - CINDY'S ROOM - DAWN - 6 YEARS EARLIER 
SOUND of TYPING. An open medical schoolbook on the PSYCHOLOGY OF PATIENTS sits on a well-organized desk. Cindy stares at the screen, hits "enter." 
PROFESSOR (O.S.) ...Imagine your patients as being in a hole. To be sympathetic means you throw them a rope to help pull them out... 
Pages print on an old printer. Outside the window, the sun has begun to rise. 
PROFESSOR (O.S.) (cont'd) ...To be empathetic means you jump in the hole with them... 
EXT. CITY BUS - MORNING - 6 YEARS EARLIER 
Cindy sits near the back of the bus. She hugs her backpack. 
PROFESSOR (O.S.) ...Now you're both stuck. 
INT. AUDITORIUM CLASSROOM - AFTERNOON - 6 YEARS EARLIER 
The PROFESSOR stands in front of the class. There are grids and diagrams illustrating DOCTOR-patient relationships. It is a big class - students, sitting in steep rows. 
PROFESSOR (CONCLUDING) I want you to think about that when we go into the next section. Please pass in your reports. 
Cindy passes her paper down. Bobby, the TA, collects the reports. Cindy can feel him staring at her as she packs her backpack.

She tries not to give him the satisfaction, but she can't help it - his cockiness is magnetic. She looks, notices something new - his belt buckle has his name on it. 
INT. BOBBY'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON - 6 YEARS EARLIER 
A gold necklace dangles from Cindy's neck. Her arms secure her weight on the bed. Bobby stands behind her. His hands caress her back as he looks down at himself inside of her. He closes his eyes tight, trying to control himself. But the ecstasy is too much - he comes inside of her, moaning, and lets his body weight smother her onto the bed. 
BOBBY (BREATHLESS) Shit. 
She stops moving, feels him shrinking inside of her. 
CINDY (REALIZING) Shit! 
BOBBY I couldn't help it. 
She gets out from underneath him. 
BOBBY (CONT'D) I couldn't help it... You felt too good. 
Cindy is white, tries to contain her terror. She disappears into the BATHROOM. Bobby sits up. 
BOBBY (calls out) (cont'd) Don't trip. It'll be OK...OK? 
Bobby lies back, frustrated, and buttons his pants. 
IN THE BATHROOM - BOBBY'S 
Cindy sits on the toilet, pees; hoping gravity will pull Bobby out of her. She runs her hand under the faucet and scrubs her crotch, hoping that this will wash him out of her. 
Cindy comes out, shirt stretched over her waist. Bobby sits up, asks her what's wrong? She can't look. 
BOBBY It's your fault. You felt too good.

At the center of the stage, a pretty MODEL used solely to test color quality sits in Langford's chair as several MEMBERS of the Tactical Patrol Force admire her considerable cleavage. A number of TECHNICIANS go about their work. CAMERAMEN move to and from their stations.

Four PLAINCLOTHESMEN are gathered behind the stage door. They watch ZSA ZSA GABOR (or some other sexy talk show celebrity) enter and then return to talking among themselves. 
CUT TO: 
117   EXT:   THE TELEVISION THEATER - DAY TO EARLY EVENING 
The situation appears normal. Only the regular backstage door GUARD, a big, grey-haired man, stands at the door. Nearby two other young MEN, in colorless suits, stand talking. We WATCH CLARENCE MCCABE, a writer, his plain WIFE and her PARENTS arrive in front of the theater, locate the backstage entrance and present themselves before the GUARD. 
MCCABE (a bit pompously) Good evening, officer. This is the backstage door I take it? 
GUARD Your name please? 
MCCABE Clarence McCabe, the writer. And this is Mrs. McCabe and her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Leroy Solters of Cleveland. 
GUARD (checking his list) I'm sorry, sir. I don't see you here. 
MCCABE I'm on the show tonight, officer. 
GUARD Well, you're not here. 
MCCABE (getting a bit agitated) Look, Cathy Long gave me instructions to present myself at a quarter to six. May I see her please? 
GUARD I'm under strictest orders tonight to admit only authorized personnel. 
MCCABE (huffy) This is absurd. (to the others) Wait right here. 
MCCABE marches past the GUARD and rushes to the backstage door. He opens it. The GUARD trails behind. 
GUARD Stop him!

121   INT:   BACKSTAGE - EVENING 
PUPKIN is looking for a familiar face.     He approaches a CAMERAMAN.

CAMERAMAN Yeah?

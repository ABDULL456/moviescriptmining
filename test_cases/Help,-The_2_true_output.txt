Morning light shines into Skeeter's room. Stuart has returned from the rig. Fully clothed, he and Skeeter sleep on Skeeter's bed. Charlotte shouts Skeeter's name from down the hall. 
CHARLOTTE (O.C.) Eugenia?! Skeeter's eyes pop open. She's groggy and hasn't fully realized the company lying next to her. 
SKEETER What?! Stuart throws his arm over Skeeter. Reality sinks in. Skeeter rolls over to find Stuart, eyes shut, smiling. 
SKEETER (CONT'D) Oh my God! Oh my God! When Stuart tries to get up, Skeeter flattens him reaches down and pulls the covers up over his entire body. 
SKEETER (CONT'D) Don't move a muscle! Skeeter props up on her side and faces the door making sure the covers hide that she's clothed. Charlotte enters and heads straight for Skeeter's closet. 
CHARLOTTE Morning, Sleepy Head. 
SKEETER Morning, Mom. Charlotte pulls out a dress and lays it on the bed, right on top of Stuart. 
CHARLOTTE I thought you could take me to the doctor this morning and then we could get some lunch afterwards. 
SKEETER Sure! Charlotte spies a LARGE TOE sticking out of the covers. It belongs to Stuart, but she assumes it's Skeeter's. 
CHARLOTTE (looking at toe) Or...we could...go straight to Fanny Mae's for a girl day. 
SKEETER Great! I'll get dressed. 
CHARLOTTE When did Stuart leave last night? 
SKEETER Right after you went to bed. 
CHARLOTTE Well, I hope he knows he's welcome to stay in Carlton's old room. 
SKEETER I'm not really ready for that yet. 
CHARLOTTE "Bird in the hand," Eugenia. Bird. In. The. Hand... Charlotte exits and shuts the door. 
STUART (under the covers.) Chirp. Chirp. Skeeter is mortified. Stuart sits up, grinning. 
SKEETER Oh my God! Stuart tries to kiss Skeeter. She resists. 
SKEETER (CONT'D) My breath is horrible. 
STUART So is mine. 
Stuart embraces Skeeter and brings his lips close to hers. 
STUART (CONT'D) I love you. 
SKEETER I love you, too. They kiss. 
EXT. STREET - DOWNTOWN JACKSON - DAY 
A bank's clock shows twelve noon in downtown Jackson. It's eerily quiet, not a soul on the street... We hear archival footage of Walter Cronkite addressing the nation. 
INT. FOOTE ESTATE - LIVING ROOM - SAME DAY 
Minny stands at the top of a tall step ladder vacuuming Oscar's head. Celia runs into the living room. Tears stream down her face. Minny turns to Celia. Cronkite tells the nation that John F. Kennedy is dead. Minny's eyes roll back in her head as she starts to faint. She grabs on to Oscar's body and slides down to the floor. 
EXT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - SAME DAY 
Hilly sits with her son William playing on a blanket on the front lawn. A neighbor suddenly pulls up in his car stopping in front of Hilly. He leans out and tells Hilly the tragic news. In complete disbelief, Hilly puts her hand over her mouth. She then grabs William, pulls him in close as if he's somehow in danger. 
EXT. BUS STOP - LATER THAT DAY 
Aibileen huddles with a dozen other maids in a circle. They're all crying. Some throw their hands in the air. 
INT. PHELAN PLANTATION - LIVING ROOM - THREE DAYS LATER 
Skeeter and Stuart sit solemnly with the Phelan family watching Cronkite's coverage of the Kennedy funeral. Skeeter's dad wipes tears from his eyes. Stuart checks the time and leans into Skeeter's ear. 
STUART Honey, I'm sorry, but I have to get down to the coast. Skeeter nods as Stuart kisses her. 
STUART (CONT'D) I'll be back in time for the benefit. Love you. 
SKEETER You, too. We hear Walter Cronkite's parting thoughts on JFK. 
INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT 
Minny, Skeeter and Aibileen sit quietly compiling stories. Aibileen and Minny look up to Aibileen's framed picture of John F. Kennedy. Aibileen grows anxious. She suddenly jumps out of her chair and paces around the kitchen. 
SKEETER Are you okay? 
AIBILEEN The world done gone crazy, Miss Skeeter! And I'm scared! What if folks find out what we writing? Figure out Niceville really Jackson, and figure out who who? 
SKEETER Aibileen. We've changed all the names. Aibileen snaps. 
AIBILEEN Y'all two gone sit there and tell me you one hundred percent without a doubt sure `bout all this?! Skeeter looks away.. 
MINNY No...So I been thinking...Maybe we need us some insurance. Skeeter look to Minny.

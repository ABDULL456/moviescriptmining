CUT TO: 
EXT. TEXAS FLATLAND - NIGHT 
The moon is rising over the horizon, across the curvilinear distance of endless scrub and sagebrush. When FLYING OBJECTS cross between it and us, their forms unidentifiable in the rising heat waves off the earth. But they are moving towards us, SILHOUETTES in the background of the moon. 
They move silently, their size INCREASING as they move closer. And then we hear them, moments before they arrive at our position, UNMARKED HELICOPTERS just overhead. Hugging the ground as they blast across the dark Texas night. 
INT. UNMARKED BLACK HELICOPTERS - NIGHT 
Flying at dangerously low altitude over the almost featureless night landscape. Heading for something that we see ahead in the distance. What looks like a LARGE GLOWING DOME surrounded by the lights of a residential area we've already seen, on the edge of suburban Dallas sprawl. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SMALL DIRT FIELD - CENTRAL TEXAS - NIGHT 
The field where the kids had been digging has been transformed into some kind of worksite. 
A LARGE WHITE DOMED TENT has been erected over almost the entire patch of ground, surrounded by the CARGO TRUCKS that we saw earlier, and more unmarked vans and trucks. There are men in black fatigues moving about, and scientists in haz-mat suits. 
As the UNMARKED BLACK HELICOPTERS bank overhead. Coming in for a landing in the glow cast from the tents. CAMERA MOVING TOWARD one of the helicopters as it lightly touches down and its black door swings open. A man stepping out, and as CAMERA PUSHES UP INTO HIS FACE we recognize him as The Cigarette Smoking Man. 
The figure that we've come to know as an assassin and a model of modern self-interest and amorality. One of the central protagonists in the conspiracy to keep the truth from the American people about the existence of extraterrestrial life. 
Something known only as: "The Project." 
He walks out from under the whirring prop, just far enough to get a flame from his lighter, to get a cigarette lit. As we: 
CUT TO: 
INT. LARGE WHITE TENT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 
A SCIENTIST in a haz-mat suit is moving through the maze of clear plastic tubing that divides work areas within the tent. Areas where scientists are working at tables doing what appears to be some kind of high-tech archeological work. It is a hive of activity within, as the Scientist leads us past the REFRIGERATION UNITS to the earthen hole where Dr. Bronschweig (we've met him earlier, coming out of a med-evac chopper that landed when the tent city was erected) appears out of the earthen hole, which is reason for all this excitement. Climbing out A CLEAR HATCH which has been fashioned to cover the hole. Seeing: 
THE CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN 
Now suited up himself. Bronschweig approaches him. 
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN You've got something to show me. 
DR. BRONSCHWEIG (nervous excitement) Yes. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ICE CAVE - CONTINUOUS 
What we originally established as icy, and what later became the unfrozen Texas field where the boys discovered the human skull, has been turned to its previously icy state. Thanks to two large vents that Dr. Bronschweig is pointing at: 
DR. BRONSCHWEIG We brought the atmosphere back down to freezing in order to control the development, which is nothing like we've ever seen. 
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN Brought on by what? 
DR. BRONSCHWEIG Heat, I think. The coincident invasion of a host, the fireman, and an environment that raised his basic body temperature above ninety eight point six. 
They step over to a section of the cave which has been draped with more plastic, the lights from inside this are giving off a cool blue light (passing by TWO PORTABLE DRILLING RIGS which have been erected, their pumps moving up and down like rocking horses.) Bronschweig pushes away the plastic, revealing A MAN lying on a gurney draped in plastic. he is hooked up to various and sundry machines which are monitoring his life signs. 
His skin has turned almost translucent, the veins and capillaries now clearly visible, as is his pulse. His heartbeat sending life-sustaining blood and energy through his body. 
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN This man's still alive. 
DR. BRONSCHWEIG Technically and biologically, though he'll never recover. 
The CSM is shaking his head in nervous, uneasy wonder. 
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN How can this be? 
DR. BRONSCHWEIG The developing organism is using his life energy, digesting bone and tissue. We've just slowed the process. 
Bronschweig redirects a light so that it shines hard into the man's face and; then we see it. Movement. 
CLOSE ON MAN'S FACE 
Though the man's eyes still blink occasionally, we can actually see through his tissue and the bones in his skull to see something IS LIVING INSIDE HIM. 
ANGLE UP ON CSM AND BRONSCHWEIG 
The Cigarette Smoking Man's mind is working intently on all the possibilities, and consequences. 
DR. BRONSCHWEIG Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates? 
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it. 
DR. BRONSCHWEIG And if it's unsuccessful? 
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN Incinerate it. Like the others.

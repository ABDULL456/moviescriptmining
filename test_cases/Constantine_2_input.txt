JOHN 
(deadpan) Why, do you have any? John puts his feet, shoes and all into a BUCKET OF WATER. 
JOHN 
I need you to step outside now. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Angela wants to stay. 
JOHN 
Angela?   Please. Angela reluctantly moves toward the exit. John holds the cat, stares into its huge, unblinking eyes. There's a moment where animal and man seem to connect. The water around John's feet begins to BOIL. ANGELA pushes the door closed behind her but it slows on its way to latch. Bulbs pulsate as current ramps down. The room flickers, is suddenly caught in a ghostly dim half-light and John has now crossed over into -- 
APARTMENT IN HELL 
Same layout, different decorator. John takes a deep, raspy breath, slowly stands. He turns to the wall behind him which is torn away, looking like some half-bombed structure in Beirut. Beyond the wall is no longer the blackness of a nightscape but a sickly sepia glow. Not quite day, not quite night. John steps over the crumbling wall into -- 
EXT. HELL LOS ANGELES 
John walks out onto the top overpass of a crumbling maze of intersecting freeways. Burnt-out husks of long- forgotten vehicles sit in rows of gridlock. A low DRONE penetrates the silence. 
JOHN 
Is she here? On the horizon is a dying RED SUN.    It strains to cut through the putrid brown haze. 
JOHN 
Is she here?! His VOICE REVERBERATES to infinity. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
John cautiously steps closer to the railing, looks down to the ribbons of twisting streets below. They're crammed with teeming masses of the damned. All walking down in silence, faces numb with sorrow and grief. 
JOHN 
IS SHE HERE?! 
That low DRONE RISES IN PITCH and John now spots a huge blanket-like BLACKNESS crawling over the cityscape, rapidly closing in on him. You get the feeling this isn't a safe place for the living. 
JOHN 
It's a simple question!    Is she here or not?!! John suddenly locks on something far off. On top of a distant skyscraper is a FEMALE FIGURE in a sheer white gown. John can't make out her face but knows she's looking right at him. 
JOHN 
Isabel? She lifts something and tosses it. John watches as a small object tumbles toward him just ahead of closing darkness. 
INT. ANGELA'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY 
In that same motion we left her in -- Angela finishes pushing the door closed. As it LATCHES -- 
JOHN (O.S.) 
(weakly) Angela... come back in... Confused, Angela pushes the door back open. Cat BOLTS out. Angela catches her breath, moves inside. 
INT. LIVING ROOM 
John sits slumped in the chair, drained. Steam rises off his skin. Angela sees the water in the bucket has almost all boiled out. She walks in, kneels down to him. 
ANGELA 
John?     What happened? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Sweat drips off as he looks up. He opens his palm -- reveals to Angela a simple HOSPITAL BAND. The name "ISABEL DODSON" is typed on it. Even as a semi-convert, this news completely floors Angela. She takes the plastic band -- grips it tight -- tries to hold herself together. The adrenaline and pain overwhelm. Her knee buckle and she drops to the floor. John watches, isn't sure how to help. He finally reaches out a single hand -- slowly rests it on her shoulder. The contact seems to open a floodgate of emotion and Angela falls right into his arms. John hasn't been this close to anyone in a long time. Angela finally composes herself. 
ANGELA 
How?   How did you do this...? John tries not to stare into those eyes too long.     Fails. 
INT. L.A. COUNTY MORGUE - NIGHT 
Body drawer slides open -- reveals Isabel. Lying in a cold, sterile room of death. A Hell of a different type. Hennessey stares down at her, looks around the room again, makes sure he's still alone. He reaches in, rips open the protective plastic and lowers his hand inside. Places it first on her forehead. Nothing. Then on her chest. Nothing. Wrist is last. Hennessey shudders. This is it. He closes his eyes and opens himself to the void -- 
JOHN (V.O.) 
When I was a kid, I saw things... 
FLASHBACK - EXT. STREET - DAY 
A TEN-YEAR-OLD John comes out of a corner store with milk in a bag. He slows, eyes a MAN at a mailbox. 
JOHN (V.O.) 
Things I wasn't supposed to. The man looks right at young John as he passes. His face is distorted and his feet have sprouted roots which are dug into the ground.

WAITRESS (O.S.) 
Coffee? Young John looks up toward the voice --

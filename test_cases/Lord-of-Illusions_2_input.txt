The Cultists all face the Sanctum door, awaiting instruction. 
NIX Will you suffer to come unto me? 
One by one, the Cultists fall to their knees.  We never see flesh pierced by broken glass.  But we HEAR IT, and see the agony on the Cultist's faces.  They start to sob. 
Then, Nix appears in the doorway, mostly hidden by shadow. 
NIX I've come back to share the wisdom of the grave.  Will you hear it? 
CULTISTS Yes... yes... 
NIX Follow me then. 
He steps out of the doorway.  The Cultists let out sobs of adoration.  Nix locks at Dorothea. 
NIX Do I know you, child? 
He reaches for her.  Pulls her close to his body. Dorothea keeps her self-possession; but only just. 
NIX Oh yes... I do, don't I?  No gun this time, child? (a beat) Where's Swann? 
DOROTHEA I don't know where he is. 
Nix picks her up, so that her feet are inches off the ground. 
NIX He'll come.  We've got unfinished business, he and I. 
Then he carries her down the passageway to the Meditation Room, walking on the glass, apparently indifferent to the wounds he's receiving. 
The Cultists follow. 
INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT 
Nix strides into the middle of the room. 
NIX (whispered to Dorothea) Something terrible's going to happen.  But if you hold on to me, very tight, you may live a little longer. 
The Cultists enter the room, knees and hands BLOODY. 
NIX (to Cultists) Are you ready for my wisdom? 
CULTISTS Tell us... tell us... 
INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT 
Harry pushes open the window, and climbs in.  Swann follows. He is frozen by the memory of what happened here. 
ON SWANN, as the TRACK fills with eerie ECHOES of that terrible event.  Nix's SCREAMS.  The GUN-SHOTS.  The sound of the SCREWS GRINDING into Nix's flesh. 
SWANN (in terrified awe) This is where we killed him. 
HARRY (looking at table) You didn't try hard enough. 
SWANN I can't... I can't go any further... 
Harry nods, and gently detaches his arm from Swann's panicked grip.  He crosses to the door. 
Suddenly. Butterfield reaches out of the darkness, and catches hold of Harry's leg. throwing him to the ground. 
He has one of the INSTRUMENTS in his hand.  He STABS at Harry, striking the ground between Harry's legs. 
INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT 
NIX Here is my wisdom. 
He stamps on the ground.  CRACKS spread from his foot in all directions. ON THE CULTISTS, amazed by this manifestation of power. 
BARBARA Show us. Puritan. 
NORMAN Yes, show us! 
ALL Show us!  Show us! 
With a ROAR, a PIT four or five feet across opens up beneath Nix and Dorothea.  Nix HOVERS over it.  It's utterly dark; perhaps bottomless. 
Dorothea SCREAMS! 
INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM- - NIGHT 
Hearing Dorothea's CRY, Harry looks back towards the passageway.  Butterfield pulls the instrument out of the ground and stabs at Harry a second time.  But Swann catches hold of his arm. 
SWANN (to Harry) Whatever he's doing to her, stop him! 
And Harry's up and away -- 
INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT 
-- he dashes over the glass -- 
INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

What's the motivation here? \nThatcher is turning up the heat. He obviously wants Poplar.

Maybe even change his life and that's gone now. I hope you're happy. \nCINDY That's not my fault. \nMIKE It isn't? Why do you think he lost his shit in there, huh?! What do you want, lady? \nCINDY I want my father. 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 98 CONTINUED: \nMIKE It didn't sound like that the other day. It sounded like you hated the guy. \nCINDY You have no idea what my father used to be like. No idea! He wasn't like he is now! He treated me like shit and he was all I had! \nMIKE So now you want to return the favor? Is that it?! \nCINDY I want that commission! That should be mine! \nMIKE And that's why you're doing all this? For fifteen hundred dollars a month? \nCINDY Isn't that why you did it? \nThis stops Mike in his tracks. \nMIKE Alright, I'll tell you what. You want the commission? You can have it. And you don't even have to take Leo. I'll take care of him for free and I'll send you the check every month. On one condition. \nCINDY What's that? \nMIKE You leave Kyle here. With us.

So what's next? \nTerry pulls up a stool. \nMIKE We're trying to figure out where he can wrestle? \nTERRY Where ever the hell he wants, right? \nMIKE No. Not right. \nKyle knocks at the door. \nMIKE (CONT'D) Hey Kyle. Come on in. How was school? \nKYLE OK. \nMIKE This is my friend Terry. \nTerry, pops up, a bit too excitedly. \nTERRY Hey man! Nice to meet you! Really nice to meet you. Welcome. \nKYLE Thanks. 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 51 CONTINUED: \nMike tries to cover. \nMIKE How the shoe's fit? \nKYLE Good. \nMIKE So let me ask you something, Kyle. You think you might want to wrestle in a match? \nKYLE OK. \nMIKE Great. We have a match on Saturday. What do you wrestle? \nKYLE One-nineteen. \n", "test2_true": "KYLE Is anyone there now? \nMIKE Yeah. Jimmy Reed.

Most of it for Jimmy Reed except for Stemler who is rooting for Kyle. \nJimmy and Kyle lock arms but Kyle pushes him away. Jimmy locks again but Kyle pushes him away again. Jimmy comes in hard this time and Kyle uses his momentum to quickly throw him to the ground. \nJimmy tries to scramble to his knees but Kyle is all over him. He quickly locks Jimmy in a cradle and rocks him onto his back. It looks easy. Vigman calls the pin. The room is quiet...except for Terry. \nTERRY Wow! \nMike shoots Terry a look. Kyle helps Jimmy off the mat. \nKYLE Good match. \nJIMMY Didn't feel good. \nVigman turns to Mike and Terry. \nVIGMAN I don't think we can teach him anything. 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 53 \nINT. DIMAIO'S PIZZERIA - LATER. \nMike, Terry, Kyle, Jackie and the kids are eating pizza. \nTERRY I don't know why we didn't quit. Just the smell of that room brought back the memories. I hated it, it was like a form of self-abuse. \nKYLE Were you guys that bad? \nTERRY Mike was average. I sucked. Sorry Abby. \nABBY It's OK. \nMike checks his watch. \nMIKE I gotta stop by the office and deal with the computer. Should I...? \nJACKIE No, I'll take him. \nTERRY We both should have quit.

Terry! \nABBY Who was busy? \nJACKIE Your Uncle Terry is just silly. \nTERRY Sorry Abby. Getting busy is bad. \nKyle cracks up.

The kid has man strength, dude. \nMike emerges from under the desk. \n", "test3_input": "MIKE You know Kyle's doing really well with wrestling here, Cindy. The regions are this weekend and if he wins there then he goes to the states. \nCINDY That's great. \nMIKE Yeah. It is and it could be really good for him. It might even mean a scholarship. Anyway, I was wondering if you could stay here for another three weeks until that's all over. 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 85 CONTINUED: \nCindy thinks about it. \nCINDY I'd like to but don't think I can afford to stay in the hotel for that long.

(Mike hangs up) He went to my friend's house. We can go get him. \nCINDY Maybe I'll just go back to the hotel. It might just be too much for him tonight. I can see him tomorrow. \nMIKE You sure? \nCINDY Yeah. I think maybe that's better. I know how Kyle can be. \nMIKE OK. I'll drop you off. \nMike keeps driving. \nINT. MIKE'S NEIGHBORHOOD - EARLY MORNING. \nMike and Kyle are jogging. Kyle's mood is dark. \nKYLE So when wrestling's over I have to go? \nMIKE I'm afraid so, pal. She's staying so you can finish the season. That's pretty nice of her. \nThey arrive back at Mike's house. Mike is really winded. \nMIKE (CONT'D) I told her you'd go see her today, Kyle. \nKYLE Where? 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 87 CONTINUED: \nMIKE Where ever you want. She could come here or we could go see her at Leo's house. She moving in this morning. \nKyle thinks. \nKYLE I'll go see her at Leo's before practice. But I want to go alone. \nMIKE (HESITANT) Yeah, that's OK but Kyle but you have to promise me... \nKYLE Don't worry, Mike.

I thought she just arrived two days ago. (MIKE SITS) How long have you been here? \nELEANOR She wanted a little time to settle in and spend some time with her father. \nMIKE So how can I help? \nELEANOR Cindy has decided that she wants a more active role in her father's care. \nMIKE What kind of a role is that? \nCINDY I want to take care of him. \nMIKE Really? So you want to move here? \nELEANOR No. Cindy would like to bring her father back to Columbus. \nCINDY That's where my support network is now. It's home. 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 89 CONTINUED: \nMIKE Well I'm not sure that's what Leo wants. \nCINDY I already talked to him about it. He seem to like the idea. \nMIKE I understand that, Cindy. But you haven't seen Leo in a long time and he's battling dementia now so it puts me in a tough position here. \nELEANOR She is the presumed Guardian, Mr Flaherty. \nMIKE I understand that. \nELEANOR And we do hope to avoid litigation. \nMIKE So do I and I'm sure we can. Now, I'm sorry, but I actually have to go see a client so we'll have to set up another time to discuss this. \nCINDY Kyle's still coming to see me today, right? \nMIKE Yeah. Of course. After school. \nELEANOR I'll have my office call. Come on Cindy. \nCINDY Thanks Mike. \nMike nods and Eleanor and Cindy leave. Mike watches them go. CLANK. CLANK. CLANK. \nEXT.

NEW PROVIDENCE HIGH SCHOOL - LATER. \nMike and Terry are standing outside talking. \nMIKE Yeah, it's that bad. \nTERRY Just take her to court, you'll kill her. \nMIKE I can't. \nTERRY Why not? She's a freaking mess. You're a pillar of the community, Mike. \nMIKE I just can't go back in front of Judge Lee, it won't look good, trust me. \nTERRY So maybe you'll get a different judge. \nMIKE She's the only Judge who handles these cases and if I look bad in front of her right now, I'm screwed. I'll have to close my fricking doors. \nTERRY Then dump it. Give her Poplar. It sucks but you've got your practice to worry about, right? \nMIKE Yeah, I do. \nTERRY Incoming, dude. \nMike turns. Kyle approaches. 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 91 CONTINUED: \nMIKE Hey, pal. \n"}

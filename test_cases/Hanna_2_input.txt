92 INT. MOROCCAN HOTEL BEDROOM - EVENING 92 
The HOTEL OWNER leads HANNA into a simple whitewashed hotel room with twin beds. They speak in Arabic with English subtitles. 
HOTEL OWNER It's the best we've got. 
HANNA Thank you. HANNA stares at the light switch. 
HANNA (CONT'D) Do you have one of these in every room? 
HOTEL OWNER Of course. All mod cons. 
HANNA It's electricity? The HOTEL OWNER looks at HANNA askance. 
HOTEL OWNER Yes. 
HANNA I know a little bit about electricity. They say Edison discovered it, or was it Franklin? 
HOTEL OWNER Some American, I'm sure. He picks up an electric kettle. 
HOTEL OWNER (CONT'D) Electric kettle for the English - they like to make their own tea. He switches it on, Hanna stares as it heats up noisily. He goes to a small wall mounted TV, switches it on for her, a fuzzy, terrible picture of an Arabic TV show. HANNA is fascinated, doesn't take her eyes off the TV as she sits on the edge of the bed. 
HANNA What is it? 
HOTEL OWNER It's the best we can do. She stares at the picture, bemused. 
HOTEL OWNER (CONT'D) Where do you come from? Distracted, HANNA is caught off guard. 
HANNA The forest. The HOTEL OWNER smiles, himself a little puzzled by this strange encounter, and leaves. She just sits there staring at the TV as it's volume seems to increase. Meanwhile the electric kettle begins to boil. Steam pours from its spout and the whole contraption starts to rattle violently. 
HANNA gets up and approaches the kettle very warily. She tries the light switch in an attempt to stop the kettle, but it keeps boiling and making its strange rattle. HANNA tries another switch, the ceiling fan begins to turn, confusing HANNA even more. On the TV the news shows footage of war in the Middle East, the sound of gunfire. The ceiling fan is at its top speed, it's blades cut the air like a helicopter. A telephone beside the bed starts to ring. Combined the noises rise to a terrifying crescendo. HANNA backs away towards the bathroom. She stumbles and falls through the bathroom door straight into the shower, inadvertently turning the taps on. Water pours down on her. HANNA springs up and turns to face the stream of water as if it were an attacker. She runs back into the bedroom. In the bedroom the kettle is still having a violent tantrum, the TV is still screaming, the fan still cutting, the phone still shouting. HANNA pulls at the exit door, but doesn't know to turn the handle. She panics. Smashes at the door. Eventually she falls through the door and into the corridor. 
93 INT. MOROCCAN HOTEL CORRIDOR - EVENING 93 
Silence as HANNA sits on the corridor floor catching her breath. A little way down the corridor MILES and SOPHIE emerge from their bedroom. 
MILES Look. It's that girl. He nudges SOPHIE. HANNA eyes them suspiciously.

BEN No. Would you please just listen to her? 
DR. KUNI Fine. Do what you want to do. 
BEN Whoa, whoa, whoa, what? 
DR. KUNI Should I leave? Do you want to be the doctor? Because I really don't need to be here. 
BEN No. What we want is to take a second to talk about our options, okay? That's all we want. 
DR. KUNI No. You mean you want to take a second to tell me how to do my job. My job is to get that baby out safely. Or I can go home! You just let me know. You be the doctor. 
BEN Can we talk outside in the hall for a second? 
INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY 
Ben and Dr. Kuni stand in the hallway. 
KNOCKED UP - 129. 
DR. KUNI That woman is a control freak, and she needs to let go and let me do my job. 
BEN Look, she's just having a hard time because her and her doctor had a very specific birth plan. And they wanted it to be a very special experience. 
DR. KUNI Okay. if you want a special experience, go to a Jimmy Buffet concert. We have a new birth plan: Get the baby out safely. 
BEN Look, man, will you help us out? I have no idea what I'm doing. You can be as big a dick to me as you want. Just be nice to her, man. That's all I ask. Just please be nice to her. Ben's stomach GROWLS loudly. 
DR. KUNI Are you okay? 
BEN I think so. 
DR. KUNI I'm sorry. Let's start fresh. 
BEN Thank you, man. 
DR. KUNI This is healthy. This is good. I think we're bonding. 
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM 
Dr. Kuni and Ben come back into the room. 
DR. KUNI Alison, I apologize for being a little brash, but if you're okay with it, it's rather important we break the bag and give you some medicine to speed things up. Because once the bag is broken, I don't want there to be an infection. 
ALISON Whatever. Do what you have to do. Dr. Kuni exits. 
ALISON (CONT'D) (whispering to Ben) Oh, my God. What a nightmare that guy is. 
KNOCKED UP - 130. 
BEN I know, I know. Look, I talked to him. I think he'll be more cool now. 
ALISON I'm so sorry I broke up with you. 
BEN You really don't need to be. And you know, I knew you'd give me another shot. I figured it'd be a lot sooner than this, you know? 
ALISON I was just in such a panic from all of this. And watching Debbie and Pete together, and my ass got so fat. 
BEN No, no. 
ALISON It did. I just never, for one minute, thought that the guy who got me pregnant would actually be the right guy for me. 
BEN Me neither. 
ALISON I guess he is. 
INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY 
Martin and Jonah wheel around the corner in wheelchairs. 
JONAH All right, Martin, who am I? 
(IMPERSONATING STEPHEN 
HAWKING) People think I'm smart because I speak in a robot voice. 
MARTIN Stephen Hawking. 
JONAH 
(IMPERSONATING STEPHEN 
HAWKING) I fuck my nurse with my ever-expanding cock. 
(STOPS IMPERSONATION) All right. Let's murderball. Come here! I'm going to murderball you! Jonah kicks Martin's wheelchair over. 
MARTIN Oh, fuck.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM 
Debbie and Pete come into the room. Pete holds a camcorder. 
DEBBIE Hi. I can't believe I go out of town and this happens. 
ALISON I know. 
DEBBIE I'm sorry, but I'm not going anywhere. 
ALISON Screw Legoland. 
PETE All right, how do you want this? You want this over the shoulder? I can do whatever you want. I can get in there. Kind of Spike Lee angles. 
ALISON No, you can shoot the waiting room. That would be great. 
DEBBIE 
(TO BEN) Well, thank you. I've got it from here. 
ALISON Debbie. 
BEN 
(TO DEBBIE) Can I talk to you in the hall for a second? 
DEBBIE Why?

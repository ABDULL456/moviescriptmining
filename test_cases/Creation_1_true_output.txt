At the top of the steps he stops for breath and he looks around. 
There is no sign of Annie but he knows this street - The Worcester Road - a row of Grey Georgian houses, their backs against the hill, their sloping front gardens looking out over the rooftops of Malvern. 
Most of the street is in darkness but the house directly opposite has lights in the window. 
He knows this house also. 
He hesitates, then crosses the street towards it. 
125   EXT. GUEST HOUSE. NIGHT                                       125 
Soaked to the skin, he raps with the brass door-knocker, then waits for someone to answer. 
Muffled voices. Then a man answers from within. 
LANDLORD (O.S.) Hello? 
DARWIN Is Mrs Carey still the landlady here. 
LANDLORD No. 
The door opens on a chain. 
DARWIN My daughter Annie ...lodged here some years ago. Can I come in? 
The man closes the door to release the chain, then opens it again to admit Darwin. 
DARWIN I know this is an intrusion. I wonder - could I visit the room she stayed in? 
The landlord doesn't know what to make of this 
LANDLORD Wait here. I'll get the missus. 
He leaves Darwin dripping in the hallway which he goes and consults with his wife in the lighted parlour. 
Darwin looks around. This place is all too familiar to him - the bevelled gold-rimmed mirror, the carved mock-Tudor coat- stand. 
Muffled conversation off. 
There are crutches and walking sticks among the umbrellas. Lavender potpourri in a brass dish. A wheel-chair in one corner, a picture of the pieta above the door. 
Finally, the land-lady emerges from    her parlour. 
LANDLADY Which room? 
DARWIN Fourteen. I would only be there ten minutes. I am happy to pay. 
She goes into an alcove and emerges with a key. 
LANDLADY Up one flight and along the corridor to the right. 
DARWIN I remember. 
LANDLADY Try not to touch anything.

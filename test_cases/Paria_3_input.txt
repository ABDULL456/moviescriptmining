BINA Oh... Well, that's cool. 
ALIKE So why weren't you gonna say anything about it? 
BINA About your shirt? 
ALIKE About the poem. 
BINA Cause you're moody. 
ALIKE Moody? 
BINA And quiet. 
ALIKE Man, I'm not moody. 
BINA Yeah, right. 
Bina stops. 
ALIKE What? 
BINA This is me. 
Alike looks up at the stoop, surprised. 
BINA (CONT'D) It's not so bad when there's some conversation, huh? 
Alike looks away. 
BINA (CONT'D) You wanna come up? 
51   INT. BINA'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON                             51 
Alike sits on Bina's twin bed, looking around and really taking in the room for the first time. She reaches over and picks up a little molded soldier figure off of the shelf. Bina fishes around in a rack of CDs. 
ALIKE Who gave you this? 
BINA What the bear? My dad. 
ALIKE No, this. 
Alike holds the figurine out, Bina looks at it over her shoulder. 
BINA Oh that. Girl, my stupid ex- boyfriend gave me that. 
ALIKE Oh. Cute. 
Bina opens a CD case and pulls the booklet out. 
BINA Not really. I mean I guess it was at the time. 
Bina lobs the little army man into a trash can across the room and hands Alike the booklet. 
BINA (CONT'D) Anyway, this is the other artist I was telling you about. Her stuff is like, bouncier. 
A buoyant Afropunk beat wafts through the bedroom. Bina plops down on the bed next to Alike. 
ALIKE This is straight. You'll burn me a copy? 
BINA Yeah, I have a bunch of other stuff, too. (beat) So who do you hang out with? I don't really see you with anybody. 
Alike shrugs and rifles through her backpack. She pulls out her composition book. Awkward silence. 
BINA (CONT'D) I didn't mean it like that. I was just asking because I was curious. I don't really like anybody that goes there either. 
ALIKE My friend Laura used to go there. Not now, but she's going back. 
BINA Oh because, I was just gonna say-- I'm going to this house party and you can come if you want to. 
Bina waves her hand at the radio. 
BINA (CONT'D) They play this kind of music.

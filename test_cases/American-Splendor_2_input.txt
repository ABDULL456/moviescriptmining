ANGLE ON SILENT GUY 
A SILENT GUY crouches by the wall, reading his CLEVELAND BROWNS trading cards. 
PAHLS Hey Harvey, if ya wanna make comics for adults, ya oughtta put some dirty stuff in it. 
GUY #3 Yeah, you can write about Marty's sex life. 
Harvey hangs with the guys but he doesn't engage. He seems to be observing them more than interacting with them. 
GUY #3 Right Marty? I heard ya went out with Bonnie yesterday. 
PAHLS Yeah. Howdja do? Wudja git offa her? 
MARTY Ah, lousy. All's I got wuz armaround. 
The guys all stare at him for a moment. Then they crack up.

INT. SOUND STAGE - PRESENT - DAY 
HIGH DEFINITION VIDEO DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE 
CLOSE UP: 
A COPY OF AMERICAN SPLENDOR #2: A FULL-COLOR CARTOON VERSION OF THE ABOVE SCENE GRACES THE COVER. 
A MARTY LOOK-ALIKE is bombarded with questions about his date with Bonnie. He complains that all he got was "arm- around." The REAL HARVEY holds the above comic book in his hand. The stage is set with a few items that indicate a comic book store. HARVEY talks about a couple of "American Splendor" issues and how they impacted his life -- recognition as a writer, etc. He gives his philosophy about the comic book, etc. A MONTAGE OF AMERICAN SPLENDOR COVERS (ISSUE #3, #4, #5, #6, ETC.) THEY INDICATE A PASSAGE OF TIME... 
CUT TO: 
INT. HARVEY'S CUBICLE - V.A. HOSPITAL - 1980'S - DAY 
HARVEY sits alone in his cubicle. He doodles stick figures on a pad -- some ideas for a new comic. His posture's miserable. He rubs his temples like he's in anguish. 
REAL HARVEY (V.O.) Here's our man eight comics later, a brand new decade, same old bullshit. Yeah sure, he gets lots of recognition for his writin' now. Sure his comics are praised by all the important media types tellin' people what to think. But so what?  It's not like he makes a livin' at it like Bob Crumb. He can't go an' quit his day job or nothin'. 
JUMP CUT SEQUENCE 
Several shots of Harvey just thinking, scratching his face with a pencil, tapping his foot nervously. 
Each shot is separated by a second or two of black (an homage to Harvey's wordless panels). Finally, he goes back to writing. 
REAL HARVEY (V.O.) Who am I kiddin'. Truth is I'd be lost without my work routine. 
FLASH CUT TO: 
INT. HARVEY'S BEDROOM - 1980'S - NIGHT 
Alone in bed, Harvey wakes up in a cold sweat from a nightmare. He looks horrified, short of breath. 
HARVEY (calming himself down) I got a job... I got a job... 
BACK TO: 
INT. HARVEY'S CUBICLE - V.A. HOSPITAL - 1980'S - DAY 
HARVEY scratches his head. 
CLOSE UP ON HIS DOODLING 
Harvey writes "I got a job" in a balloon over the stick figure's head. 
REAL HARVEY (V.O.) So -- to stave off desperation and feelings of uselessness -- I resigned myself to a menial existence. But hey, maybe the guy who's had a happy life feels worse just before he dies than th' guy who had a sad one. Or, maybe not. I dunno. Maybe I just needed a woman. 
Toby comes in, decked out in plaid and stripes. He has an empty messenger bag. 
TOBY Hi, Harvey. Do you want these gourmet jelly beans? I gave up sweets for lent. 
Harvey turns around. He seems down, depressed.

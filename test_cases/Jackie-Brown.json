{"train": "JACKIE BROWN \nJackie Brown \nScreenplay by Quentin Tarantino \nOPENING CREDITS \nINT. LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY \nWe hear the rhythm of funky seventies SOUL MUSIC. \nThen SHE steps into FRAME. \nShe is JACKIE BROWN, a stewardess dressed in her CABO AIR uniform. (A little shuttle airline that flies from Los Angeles to Cabo San Lucas. Approximate flight time: forty five minutes) \nJackie stands still as a people-mover slowly inches her through the airport. The CREDITS APEAR and DISAPPEAR in front of her. \nJackie Brown is a very attractive black woman in her mid forties, though she looks like she's in her mid-thirties. \nThe people-mover reaches the end of the line, she steps off. \nShe breezes through Customs and we follow her with a STEDICAM as she strides through the airport... She gets to her gate disappears inside the plane for a moment comes back out sans flight bag picks up the microphone. \nJACKIE (into mike) Flight 710 Cabo San Lucas, now boarding Gate 12, first class only. \nWith a smile on her face, she collects passengers' boarding passes as they board the plane. \nFADE TO BLACK \nTITLE CARD \n\"ORDELL ROBBIE\" \nFADE UP ON: \nEXT. FIRING RANGE - DAY \nVIDEO \nA chorus line of six beautiful bikini-clad women, all holding different automatic weapons, BLASTING away. \nThe cheap VIDEO TITLES to: \n\"CHICKS WHO LOVE GUNS\" \nPlay over this image. \nOne bikini beauty is singled out. She's a gorgeous brunette named SIDNEY. Sidney stands facing camera holding a TEC-9 and describing it. \nSIDNEY (to camera) Hi, I'm Sidney. And I love to TEC-9. The popular TEC-9 is advertised by its makers as being tough as the toughest customer. \nSIDNEY'S STATISTICS: Age, height, measurements, date of birth, appear at the bottom left-hand corner. As Sidney continues her sales pitch/demonstration, a BLACK MAN'S VOICE begins talking over the video. \nBLACK MAN (O.S.) That's a TEC-9. It's a cheap ass spray gun outta South Miami. \nAfter a CLOSEUP of the TEC-9, Sidney FIRES the weapon. \nBLACK VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D) Cost three-eighty retail. I get them for two hundred and sell 'em for eight. \nINT. MELANIE'S BEAHC APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThe Black Voice belong to forty-five-year old ORDELL ROBBIE. \nOrdell wears clothes nice and likes wearing nice clothes. Stylish, athletic wear (Reebok), heavy, black leather jackets (Hugo Boss), warm-colored berets and baseball caps to cover his balding head are Ordell's \"look.\" At this moment Ordell's wearing an open silk shirt. \nOrdell narrates the video playing on the big-screen V. (the most expensive thing in the apartment). He holds a cocktail in one hand (screwdriver, his drink of choice) and the remote control in the other, pacing the floor in his I-can-talk-anybody-into-anything voice. \nLOUIS GARA, who looks like he does his shopping at the Salvation Army (dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and dungarees), sits on the sofa staring blankly at the video, drinking Jack Daniels on ice. Louis, white, also in his mid forties, has lived over half of his life in penal institutions. The experience has affected both his body language and his thought process. \nWhile acutely aware of the rhythm of life inside a correction facility, in the real world his timing is thrown. It's like a song he doesn't know the lyrics to but attempt to sing anyway. \nThe third person watching the video is the person who lives in this apartment, MELANIE RALSTON. Melanie, thirty- three, is a tanned, blonde, California beach bunny. Like the kind you se in the old Crown International movies from the seventies like \"Pom Pom Girls\" \"Malibu Beach\" and \"Beach Girls,\" except Melanie is older than any of those girls ever are. She's dressed in her Melanie- uniform of stringy Levis cutoffs and a stringy bra top. So far Melanie has been able to make a living out of lying in the sun, always finding a generous, wealthy man more than willing to pay her rent and pick up her tabs. In her prime (twenty two) it was Japanese industrialists, film production guys, and Middle Eastern businessmen who kept Melanie. And it was places like the Bahamas, Acapulco, and the Virgin Islands where they kept her. \nBut now, at thirty three, she lives in an apartment in Hermosa Beach, California that Ordell pays for an drops in and out of. She's curled up in a reclining chair, smoking weed from a pipe, reading Movieline Magazine and paying no attention to the video. \nORDELL This TEC-9? They advertise it as being the most popular gun in American crime. Can you believe that shit? It actually says that on the little booklet that comes with it. \"Most Popular Gun in American Crime,\" like they're proud of that shit. \nOrdell hits the fast-forward on his remote control. \nSidney is rushed off the screen and replace by CINDY, a pretty, blonde bodybuilder clad in a red, white and blue bikini, holding a Styer Aug. \nORDELL (CONT'D) Check out this body-builder chick... Now see what she got. That's a Styer aug. Styer Aug's a bad motherfucker. Listen. \nOrdell punches up the volume. \nCindy BLASTS the Styer Aug, loud. \nOrdell imitates the sound of the weapon. \nORDELL (CONT'D) Shit's expensive, man. Comes from Austria. My customers don't know shit about it, so there ain't no demand. (to Melanie) Baby, I could use some more ice. \nMelanie puts down the magazine, takes his cocktail glass from him and moves to the kitchen. \nORDELL (CONT'D) But put that bad boy in a flick, every motherfucker out there want one. I'm serious as a heart attack. Them Hong Kong movies came out, every nigga gotta have a forty-five. And they don't want one, they want two, cause nigga want to be \"The Killer.\" What they don't know, and that movie don't tell you is a .45 has a serious fuckin' jammin' problem. I always try and steer a customer towards a 9- millimeter. Damn near the same weapon, don't have half the jammin' problems. But some niggas out there, you can't tell them anything. They want a .45. The killer had a .45, they want a .45. \nMelanie comes back, hands Ordell his screwdriver, then sits where she was. \nORDELL (CONT'D) Thanks, Baby. \nLOUIS Who's your partner? \nOrdell sits down on the couch. Melanie's reading \"Movieline Inside\" magazine. \nORDELL Mr. Walker. He runs a fishing boat in Mexico. I deliver the merchandise to him, gets it to my customers. On all my bulk sales, anyway. Nigga didn't have a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out 'fore I set 'em up. Now, motherfucker's rollin' in cash. He got himself a yacht, with all kinds of high tech navigational shit on it. (back to video) AK-47, the very best there is. \nGLORIA, a tall, Amazonian, bikini-clad, black woman faces camera and describes the AK-47. \nORDELL (CONT'D) When you absolutely, positively, gotta kill every motherfucker in the room, accept no substitute. That there is the Chinese one. I pay eight- fifty and double my money. \nThe phone rings. \nORDELL(CONT'D) Get that for me, will ya baby? \nMELANIE You know it's for you. \nOrdell just stares at her. \nORDELL Girl, you better not make me go over there and put my feet to ya. \nLouis keeps staring at he screen. \nMelanie gets up, goes over to the counter that separates the living room from the kitchen, picks up the phone, says: \nMELANIE Hello. \nPuts the phone down and says; \nMELANIE (CONT'D) It's for you. \nMAX (CONT'D) (on phone) Reggie, there ain't no two ways about it. You're spending the night in jail, but I already told you I'll get you out tomorrow. Now where are you? (pause) You're at your mother's house, aren't you? \nOrdell lights up a cigarette. (Viceroy). \nHe notices a picture on the wall of Max with his arm around a big, powerfully built black man. They're both grinning. \nLouis pours himself some coffee from a coffeemaker into a small, white styrofoam cup. He picks up a jar of powdered non-dairy creamer that's so dry he has to break off a rock. Louis adds the rock of coffeemate to his beverage. \nMAX (CONT'D) (on phone) Okay. Just stay put till I come for you. (pause) Reggie, do yourself a really big favor and be there when I get there. \nHe hangs up the phone. \nOrdell sits in front of the desk, smiling at him and smoking. \nMAX (CONT'D) How can I help you? \nORDELL (indicating the Viceroy) Where would you like me to put my ash? \nMax looks at him for a moment. \nMAX Use that coffee cup on the desk. \nOrdell picks up the coffee cup, which still has a little bit of coffee in it, and flicks his ash. \nORDELL And I need me a bond for ten thousand. \nMax throws a look past Ordell to Louis. \nORDELL (CONT'D) Oh, that's just my white friend, Louis. He's got nothing to do with my business. We just hangin together. We're on our way to a cocktail lounge. \nFrom across the room, Louis nods his head in Max's direction. \nMax looks at him a moment, then back to Ordell. \nORDELL (CONT'D) (returning to the photo) Who's that big Mandingo nigga you gotcha arm around? \nMax looks at him a moment and says; \nMAX That's Winston. He works here. \nORDELL He's a big one. You two tight? \nMAX Yeah. \nORDELL It was our idea to take the picture, wasn't it? \nMax looks at Ordell, getting his drift, then says; \nMAX So, you want a ten-thousand dollar bond. What've you got for collateral? \nORDELL Gonna have to put up cash. \nMAX You have it with you? \nOrdell picks up his Lakers bag and puts it in the empty chair next to him. \nORDELL It's in my bag. \nMAX You have cash. What do you need me for? \nORDELL C'mon, you know how they do. Black man comes in with ten thousand, they wanna fuck with 'em. First off, they gonna wanna know where I got it. Second, they gonna keep a big chunk of it - start talkin' that court cost shit. Fuck that shit, Jack. I'll go through you. \nMAX Cost you a thousand for the bond. \nORDELL I know that. \nLouis just stands, feeling uncomfortable, in the other room drinking coffee. \nMAX Who's it for? A relative? \nORDELL Fella named Beaumont. They have him up at county. It started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up \"possession of a concealed weapon.\" Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him. \nMAX Ten thousand sounds high. \nORDELL They ran his name and got a hit. He's been in before. Besides, Beaumont's from Kentucky, and I think they're prejudiced against black men from the South out here. \nMAX He takes off and I gotta go to Kentucky to bring him back, you pay the expenses. \nORDELL You think you could do that? \nMax taking papers out of the drawer... \nMAX I've done it. \n... picking up the pen... \nMAX (CONT'D) What's his full name? \nORDELL Beaumont. That's the only name I know. \nMax looks at Ordell, but doesn't ask him the obvious question. \nMax picks up the phone. \nMAX (on phone) Records office. \nMax on hold, looks at Ordell. \nOrdell smiles. \nMAX (CONT'D) (back on the line) Hello, this is Max Cherry. Cherry Bail Bonds. Who's this? (pause) Hi, Vicki. Look, Vicki, I need you to look up the booking card and rough arrest on a defendant named Beaumont. (pause) That's all I have. I believe it's a surname but I'm not sure. Thanks. \nLouis enters the area, standing over Ordell. \nLOUIS I'm going to wait in the car. \nORDELL Sure. (to Max) We almost done, ain't we? \nMAX Getting there. \nORDELL You go wait in the car. Wait a minute. \nOrdell pulls out a heavy-duty keychain with a shitload of keys on it. \nORDELL Take the keys, man. Listen to music. \nLOUIS Which one is for the car? \nOrdell finds it. While he goes through the keys, Vicki comes back on the line. \nMax speaks with her as he fills out his papers. \nORDELL (holding a key) This one's for the ignition... (holding a little black box) ... but you gotta hit this thing to shut the alarm off and unlock the door. \nLOUIS What do I do? \nORDELL You ain't got to do nothing. Just point at it and push the button. You'll hear the car go \"bleep.\" That means the alarm's off and the doors are open. \nLOUIS Okay. \nBeaumont gesture inside his apartment. \nBEAUMONT Hey, c'mon in, man. I was just - you know - smokin' a fatty, watchin' TV. \nORDELL Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I was kinda hopin you could come with me. \nBEAUMONT What'd ya mean? \nORDELL Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga, does a nigga a favor - then BAM - hits a nigga up for a favor in return. But I'm afraid I gotta be that kinda nigga. \nBEAUMONT What? \nORDELL I need a favor. \nBEAUMONT That requires me goin out tonight? \nORDELL A bit. \nBEAUMONT Aaaaawww man, I wasn't plannin' on goin no place. It's twelve o'clock, man. I'm home, I'm high - \nORDELL Why the fuck you at home? Cause I spent ten thousand dollars gittin' your ass home. (changes tone) Look, I gotta problem. I need help, and you can help me. \nThis has the desired effect. \nTIME CUT: \nWITH ORDELL WAITING OUTSIDE THE DOOR \nBeaumont comes out of the apartment, sporting Nikes and a Queen Latifah t-shirt. He locks his front door and walks with Ordell to his car. They talk the whole way. We STEDICAM in front of them the whole way. \nBEAUMONT What's the problem? \nORDELL Well, it ain't so much a problem a a situation. Remember I sold those three M-60 machine guns outta the five I got? \nBEAUMONT Uh-huh. \nORDELL I'm gonna sell the other two tonight. This group of Koreans in Koreatown have started a Neighborhood Watch kinda thing. And they want a few weapons so the neighborhood niggas know they mean business. So I'm gonna sell 'em my two machine guns tonight. Only problem, I aint never dealt with these Koreans before. Now I aint worried. Asians are by and large real dependable. They don't want no trouble. You might argue about price, but you aint gotta worry about them shootin' you in the back. But I got me kind of a rule. Never do business with nobody you ain't never done business with before without backup. That's why I need you, backup. \nBEAUMONT Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out nowhere - \nORDELL - Let me finish. Can I finish? \nBEAUMONT Go ahead. \nCUT TO: \nTRUNK \nThe trunk of a car is opened. \nOrdell bends down into the trunk and pulls out a pump action shotgun. Beaumont obviously doesn't want any part of any Ordell game that requires a pump action shotgun as a playing piece. \nORDELL Now you're gonn be in the trunk holding onto the shotgun. And I'm going to tell them I'm opening up my trunk to show 'em my goods. I open up the trunk, you pop up, rack that bad boy. \nBEAUMONT Fuck that shit, man. I ain't shootin' anybody. \nORDELL What the fuck I tell you. You don't hafta shoot nobody. Just hold the gun. They'll get the idea. \nBEAUMONT I ain't gittin' in that trunk. \nORDELL We're only goin' to Koreatown. You'll be in there - ten minutes. \nBEAUMONT Uh-uh. I ain't riding in that trunk no minutes. Why don't I just ride with you? \nORDELL You can't ride with me. The surprise effect is ninety percent of it. \nBEAUMONT Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't gittin' in that trunk. \nORDELL I can't believe you do me this way. \nBEAUMONT I ain't doin' you no way. I just ain't climbin' in that trunk. I got a problem with small places. \nORDELL Well, my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful, peanut-head niggas outta jail, but I do it - \nBEAUMONT Look, man, I know I owe you - \nORDELL - Well, if you owe me, git your ass in the trunk. \nBEAUMONT - I wanna help you, but I don't wanna be locked in the trunk of no car. \nORDELL You think I wanted to spend ten thousand dollars on your ass? \nBeaumont starts to speak - \nORDELL (CONT'D) Answer the question, nigga. Do you think I wanted to spend the thousand dollars on your ass? Yes or no? \nBEAUMONT Course you didn't. \nORDELL But the only way to help you was to do that, so I did it. (pause) Okay, how 'bout this? After we're through fuckin' with these Koreans, I take you to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles. My treat. \nBeaumont smiles. So does Ordell. \nORDELL (CONT'D) Just think, man. That Scoe's special, smothered in gravy and onions. Get a side of red beans and rice. Uuuuummmmm, that's some good eatin'. \nBeaumont and Ordell laugh together... the Beaumont says; \nBEAUMONT Now exactly how long I gotta be in this motherfucker. \nCUT TO: \nTRUNK \nBeaumont in the trunk, holding the shotgun. The trunk lid is SLAMMED closed. \nEXT. / INT. OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT \nOrdell walks around the car, climbs into the plush interior of the Olds and turns on the engine. It comes to life with a SOFT RUMBLE. He puts a tape in the player inside the dash. \nThe tape is labeled \"ORDELL'S JAMS.\" \nCool, old-school R&B fills the cab. \nOrdell cruises, moving his head to the rhythm and mouthing the words. \nHe drives for awhile, just groovin' on the music... \n... then stops. \nOrdell switches the engine and the music off. The cab goes black. \nHe leans over the passenger seat, opening the glovebox. A tiny light turns on when the glovebox is opened. It's the only light in the cab. Ordell leaves it on. \nIn silence he takes one glove out and puts it on his right hand. Then with his gloved hand, reaches in the glovebox and pulls out a five-shot .38 snubby. He closes the glovebox. \nThe cab goes black. \nEXT. OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT \nThe Olds is parked out in the middle of some urban nowhere. \nDARGUS Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargus. L.A.P.D. can I ask what you have in that bag? \nJACKIE The usual things. I'm a flight attendant with Cabo Air. \nYoung plainclothes cop RAY NICOLET, enters the scene. \nNICOLET Can I be of some assistance? \nAs Jackie pulls the cigarettes (Davidoffs) from her purse, she says to Ray; \nJACKIE I doubt it. (to Dargus) Who's your friend? \nDARGUS This is Special Agent Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Would you mind if we looked in that bag? \nJackie lights her cigarette with a yellow Bic lighter. \nJACKIE Would I mind? Do I have a choice? \nDARGUS You have the right to say \"no.\" And I have the right to make you wait here with Ray while I go get a warrant. And if I don't want to go through all that trouble, I could just take you in on suspicion. \nJACKIE Suspicion of what? \nNICOLET All he wants to do is peek in your bag. I'll watch he doesn't take anything. \nJackie shrugs and says; \nJACKIE Go ahead. \nDargus lays the flight bag on the pavement, gets down on his haunches, and starts feeling through her things. \nCLOSEUP FLIGHT BAG \nA soiled blouse, uniform skirt, - then a manila envelope, a fat one, nine-by-twelve. \nJackie watches him straighten the clasp... \nENVELOPE \nOpens it. Out drops several packets of one hundred dollar bills secured with rubberbands. \nNicolet whistles. \nDargus looks up at her. \nDARGUS I'd say there's about, oh, fifty thousand dollars here. What would you say Ray? \nNICOLET That looks like fifty thousand dollars from here. \nJACKIE \nNot saying anything at the moment. \nDARGUS This is your money? \nJACKIE If I were to tell you \"no it isn't...\" \nDargus smiles. \nDARGUS You should know if you bring in anything over ten thousand you have to declare it. You forgot or what? You could get a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine, plus two years in prison. Now you want to talk to us about it, or you want to talk to Customs? \nJACKIE I'm not saying another word. \nNICOLET Listen, Jackie, Hope you don't mind if I call you Jackie. They're a bunch of fuckin' pricks in Customs. Something about that job makes them kinda hard to get along with. Now, do you want to talk with a bunch of suspicious, disagreeable people like them, or a couple good-hearted guys like Mark and myself. \nNicolet smiles. \nCLOSEUP JACKIE \nDoesn't smile back. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nCLOSEUP JACKIE \nSitting in a chair facing the two offscreen detectives. Jackie lights up a cigarette. We don't leave the CLOSEUP until noted. \nINT. DARGUS OFFICE - DAY \nDARGUS (O.S.) Hey, this is my office. There's no smoking. \nJACKIE Arrest me. \nNicolet laughs O.S. \nDARGUS (O.S.) We could, smart ass... or we could work out what's known as a Substantial Assistance Agreement. That is if you're willing to cooperate. Tell us who gave you the money and who you're giving it to. \nJackie doesn't sat anything... she just smokes. \nNICOLET (O.S.) You got a good lawyer? \nDARGUS (O.S.) Can she afford a good one is the question. Otherwise she'll be in Sybill Brand three weeks easy before the Public Defender gets around to her. \nNICOLET (O.S.) Ever heard of a fella named Beaumont Livingston? \nNot a word. \nNICOLET (O.S.) (CONT'D) Don't know Beaumont? That's funny 'cause Beaumont knows you. Well he did know you, Beaumont was found in the trunk of a car - dead. Shot twice. Once in the head and once in the chest. \nJackie, she puts the \"ool\" in \"cool.\" \nNICOLET (O.S.) (CONT'D) I had the chance to talk to Beaumont yesterday. You see, like you, Beaumont found himself in some hot water. He was looking at ten years he was pretty sure he didn't want to do and was understandably concerned. Now maybe you don't know Beaumont, but Beaumont knew you, and maybe so does the guy who blew Beaumont's head off. \nNot a word. \nDARGUS (O.S.) If you don't want to talk to us, I guess we'll just have to hand you over to Customs. \nJackie puts out her cigarette. \nJACKIE Okay, let's go. \nShe stares down the cops. \nDARGUS AND NICOLET \nWe cut to the detective and the special agent for the first time in the scene. \nDARGUS You know, Miss Brown, there's basically three types of people that we come along in the performance of our duty. One is, INNOCENT PEOPLE. Victims, witnesses, innocent bystanders... You ain't any of these. Then there's two; CRIMINALS. These sonabitches have dedicated their lives to a life outside the law. That ain't you either. Where you belong is the third category. The category we refer to as LOSERS. \nJackie's eyes don't even narrow at the insult. She just says without expression; \nJACKIE I'm not a loser. \nDARGUS Oh, you're both? In 1985 you were flying for TWA and got busted for carrying drugs. You were carrying them for a pilot husband of yours. He did time and you got off. But that ended your career with the big airlines. Cut to thirteen years later. You're forty-four years of age. You're flying for the shittiest little shuttle-fucking piece of shit Mexican airline that there is. Where you make a whopping twelve-thousand dollars a year. That ain't a hulluva lot to show for a twenty year career. And to top it off, you're going to jail. Now true, the judge, even with your prior, will probably only give you a year or two. But this doesn't seem like the time of life you got years to throw away. (pause) Now, we don't like trying losers like they're criminals. But in the absence of a criminal, we will try you. Now, wasn't this money given to you by an American living in Mexico by the name of Cedric Walker? \nJackie remains unmoved by this monologue. \nNicolet joins back in. \nNICOLET You know, ol' Beaumont wasn't much for talkin', either. Yeah, he told us about you and Mr. Walker, but whoever the hell it was he worked for out here, he wouldn't say. Could it be the same person you were supposed to deliver this money to? \nJUDGE You have a recommendation for bail? \nDARGUS Yes, I do, your honor. Based on the defendant's prior conviction and the extreme possibility of flight due to her occupation, the State requests a bond of no less than twenty-five thousand. \nThe Judge looks at the report, then at Jackie... \nJUDGE I'll set bond at ten thousand and set the date of August 14th for the arraignment. \nJACKIE When is that, your honor? \nJUDGE That's six weeks from now, Miss Brown. We'll continue this matter then. Owens, case 72242. \nJackie sits down. \nDargus sits down next to Nicolet. They smile and giggle together. \nJackie sees them giggle like fifth graders. It fucking pisses her off. \nDIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE \nWe go from a CLOSEUP of a boiling Jackie, to a perspective from the back of the courtroom. \nWe see Jackie in the defendant's area. \nWe see the two happy detectives walk past us on their way out of the courtroom. \nORDELL \nSits in the back, watching the proceedings without any expression. When he's seen enough, he stands up and out of the shot leaving an EMPTY FRAME. \nFADE TO BLACK \nTITLE CARD \n\"MAX CHERRY\" \nFADE UP ON: \nINT. MAX CHERRY'S OFFICE - DAY \nThe bathroom door in Max's office. We hear a toilet flush behind it. The door opens, and Max Cherry emerges, zipping up his pants with a TV guide in his hand. \nHe looks up and stops dead. \nOrdell sitting oh-so comfortably in the chair in front of Max's desk. \nORDELL Unh... unh... unh... I din't hear you wash your hands. \nMax looks at Ordell, then takes his place behind his desk. \nMAX Comfortable? \nORDELL The door was opened, so I just came right in. \nMAX I can see that. Why? \nORDELL I got some more business for ya. \nMAX Oh, yeah? What did he do? \nORDELL (O.S.) She is an airline stewardess. Got caught coming back from Mexico with some blow. They set her bond this afternoon at ten thousand. Now, what I was thinkin', you could use the ten thousand you owe me from Beaumont and move it over on to the stewardess. \nMAX The bond for possession is only a thousand. \nORDELL They fuckin' wit' her. They callin' it Possession with Intent. A black woman in her forties gets busted with less than two ounces on her, they call that shit Intent. Same shit happened to a movie star. It's Possession. \nMAX It still sounds high. \nORDELL She had, I believe it was... fifty grand on her, too. There was a cop at the hearing. Young guy with L.A.P.D. wanted her bond set at twenty-five thousand, saying there was a risk of flight. Jackie being a stewardess and all. \nMAX Before we start talking about stewardess, let's get Beaumont out of the way first. \nSitting back in the chair - almost grinning - but not quite. \nORDELL Somebody already did. \nMAX What? \nORDELL You didn't hear? \nMAX Hear what? \nORDELL Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out - hey, that rhymes - blew Beaumont's brains out. \nMAX Did the police contact you? \nORDELL Very first motherfuckin' thing they did. They see I put up a big money bond on my boy, they start thinking with that where-there's-smoke-there's fire logic. They roust my ass outta bed, ten o'clock in the morning. Fuckin' scare my woman, Sherona, half to death. She thought they were gonna take my ass away for sure. \nMAX The stewardess. Do you know her last name? \nORDELL (smiles) Brown, Jackie Brown. \nMAX What does she do for you? \nORDELL Who says she does anything for me? She's my friend. When my friends get into trouble, I like to help 'em out. \nMAX Beaumont worked for you. \nORDELL That's what the police thought. I told them I'm unemployed, how could I have anybody work for me? Now I bail out Jackie, I'm liable to have the police on me again, huh? Wanting to know was she doing things for me, was she bringing me that money! \nMAX Was she? \nORDELL Is this, me and you, like a lawyer- client relationship? The lawyer can't tell nothing he hears? \nMAX You're not my client until you get busted and I bond you out. \nORDELL If there's no - what do you call it - confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything? \nMAX Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are. You got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand. \nORDELL Why would a stewardess bring me fifty grand? \nMAX You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. An indemnity agreement - \nORDELL - Jackie aint got time for all that shit - \nMAX - I'm telling you what I have to do. What you have to do, in case you forgot, is come up with premium of a thousand bucks. \nORDELL I got it. I just don't got it on me. \nMAX Well, come back when you do, and I'll bond out the stewardess. \nORDELL Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit. \nMAX If I don't see it in front of me, you're right. It ain't shit. \nORDELL Man, you need to look at this with a little compassion. Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't used to this kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters don't give a fuck - but for the average citizen, coupla nights in County fuck with your mind. \nMAX Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you don't have a tab. \nJACKIE I don't think so. \nMAX It's okay. It's a cop hangout. \nJACKIE Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven? \nMAX I thought you might want a drink? \nJACKIE I'd love one, but not there. \nMAX We could stop at the Hilton by the airport. \nJACKIE Is it dark? \nMAX It's kind of a sports bar \nJACKIE That doesn't sound dark. \nMAX Why does it need to be dark? \nJACKIE 'Cause I look like I just got outta jail, that's why. You droppin' me off at home, right? There's a place by me. \nMAX Great. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE COCKATOO INN - NIGHT \nA big neon sign of a cockatoo sits on op of a red brick inn. \nINT. THE COCKATOO INN - NIGHT \nCLOSEUP - A KNOB is pulled out. \nJackie picks up a pack of Mild Seven's cigarettes from the bottom of a cigarette machine. She crosses the bar to join Max, sitting at a small table waiting for her to return. \nThe Cockatoo Inn is just what Jackie was looking for. A dark and red cocktail lounge in Hawthorne off of Hawthorne Boulevard by the apartment where the stewardess lives (about ten minutes from LAX) \nThe clientele of the Cockatoo is an older, black crowd and an even older white crowd who'd been coming here years before it became a black bar. \nA JUKEBOX plays soft, old-school R&B. \nJackie and Max sit side by side at a small table, lit by a bar candle in a red glass thing. \nMax drinks Bushmills over crushed ice. Jackie drinks white wine. Jackie opens her Mild Sevens, offering one to Max. \nMAX No thanks, I quit three years ago. \nAs she lights her cigarette. \nJACKIE You gain weight? \nMAX Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back on. \nJACKIE That's why I don't quit. If I can't fly anymore, I'm gonna have a bitch of a time gettin' my brand. \nMAX What's your brand? \nJACKIE Davidoffs. I get 'em in Mexico. They're hard to find here. I was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for bustin' her boyfriend's head open with a baseball bat. \nMAX Was she helpful? \nJACKIE She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender. (she takes a sip of wine) I don't know - I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options are. \nMAX You know, I figured out the other day I've written something like' fifteen thousand bonds since I've been in the business. I'd say about eighty percent of them were at least drug related. If you want, I can help you look at your options. \nJackie takes the talk in a different direction. \nJACKIE You're not tired of it? \nMAX (smiles) I am, as a matter of fact. \nA moment of silence between them, they both take drinks. \nMAX (CONT'D) What have they told you? \nJACKIE So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right? \nMAX I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison. \nJACKIE (under her breath) Shit. \nMAX But they won't want to take you to trial. They'll offer you simple Possession, a few months of County time, and a year or two probation. (pointing to her drink) How 'bout another? \nJACKIE Sure. \nMax gestures to an older black cocktail waitress named ROWEN for two more. \nMAX You know who put the dope in your bag? \nJACKIE Yeah, but that's not what this was about. They were fuckin waitin' for my ass. They knew I had that money, they even knew the amount. The one who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D., Dargus, hardly even looked at it. \"Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand here. What would you say?\" But all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to Customs, and I could tell they didn't want to do that. \nMAX They wanted you to tell them what you know. \nJACKIE I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke. \nMAX What did they want to know? \nJACKIE Who gave me the money and who I was giving it to. And some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off. Said it was him who told them 'bout me. \nThe Waitress comes with the drinks. \nROWEN Can I get you two some popcorn? \nMAX No, thanks. \nRowen exits. \nMAX (CONT'D) That would be Beaumont Livingston. \nJACKIE That's him. How do you know 'em? \nMAX I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday. \nJACKIE Ordell pick up his bond? \nMAX Same as you. Ten thousand. \nJACKIE The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont. \nMAX You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D., but you didn't mention the Federal. \nJACKIE I didn't? \nMAX No, you didn't. What branch? \nJACKIE Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. \nMax puts it together. \nJACKIE You're not asking the right questions. \nThen she walks past him back to the living room. She goes over to the halogen lamp, turning the light up brighter, then moves by the door, still standing and looking at Ordell in the kitchen doorway. \nJACKIE Beaumont Livingston. \nORDELL I knew it. \nJACKIE And they asked if I knew Mr. Walker. \nOrdell by the halogen lamp. He turns it back to dim. \nORDELL Yeah? \nJACKIE I didn't tell 'em anything. \nOrdell moves slowly towards Jackie. \nORDELL My name come up? \nJackie slowly shakes her head \"no.\" \nOrdell directly in front of Jackie, he gently places his gloved hands on her shoulders. \nORDELL (CONT'D) You say anything about me? \nJackie shakes her head \"no.\" \nORDELL (CONT'D) Well, that's mighty honorable of you. \nOrdell's gloved fingertips move up her collarbone to her throat, gently touching her skin. Jackie locks eyes with his, but still shows no fear. \nORDELL (CONT'D) This fella Beaumont, they say what happened to him? \nJACKIE They told me. \nAt this moment the film becomes a: \nSPLIT SCREEN \nOn the RIGHT-HAND SIDE is Ordell with his hands barely touching Jackie's throat. On the LEFT-HAND SIDE is Max driving home in his Seville. \nMAX IN CAR \nMax drives home, an almost moony romantic look no his face. He can't stop thinking about Jackie. During the night she'd have a gleam in her eyes, the look saying; \"WE COULD HAVE FUN\". Unless she was appraising kinda him with the look, making a judgment and what it said was; \"I COULD USE YOU\". Either way it was a turn-on. \nMax pulls into the driveway of his small house in Torrance. \nORDELL AND JACKIE \nORDELL Yeah, somebody musta been real mad at Beaumont. Or  they were afraid of what he might say to keep from doin some time. I'magine from time-to-time they asked you a whole shitload of questions. And you didn't give 'em no answer? \nJackie shakes her head from side to side. \nOrdell moves his thumbs from her collarbone to the middle of her throat. \nORDELL You scared of me? \nJackie shakes her head from side to side without her eyes leaving his. Reaches over the seat \nORDELL You got a reason to be nervous with me? \nWith his hands on Jackie's throat, staring into the woman's eyes, from BELOW FRAME then feels something hard the fuck against his crotch. Neither break eye contact. \nOrdell hears a CLICK. \nCan't believe it. \nMAX IN CAR \nMax takes his keys, then to the glove box... \nTHE GLOVE BOX \nThe gun is gone. \nMAX Where is it? \nA CLOSEUP OF MAX'S GUN IN ORDELL ORDELL'S CROTCH \nORDELL Is that what I think it is? \nJACKIE What do you think it is? \nCLOSEUP GUN IN CROTCH \nORDELL I think it's a gun pressing against my dick. \nJACKIE You thought right... Now take your hands from around my throat, nigga. \nOrdell flashes his hustler's smile and lets go. \nEND OF SPLIT SCREEN \nJackie turns Ordell around, gun firmly in his back, and pushes him against the wall. \nORDELL What the hell you doin'? \nJACKIE Shut your ass up and grab the wall! \nJackie has Ordell against the wall and is frisking him the way a cop would. She finds the .22 pistol in his pocket \nORDELL Now, baby, that's got nothin' to do with you. I just carry that. You been listenin' to them cops too much. \nJACKIE The cops didn't try and strangle my ass. \nORDELL Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with you. \nJACKIE Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm gonna unload both these motherfuckers, you don't do what I tell you. Understand what I'm saying? \nORDELL Baby, I ain't come here - \nShe shoves both guns in Ordell's back. \nJACKIE I said, you understand what I'm saying \nORDELL I understand woman, damn! \nJACKIE Go sit over in that chair. \nOrdell moves over to a chair across from the couch. Ordell still tries bullshit... \nORDELL I'm tellin' you, those cops been fuckin' wit your mind. They turn black against black, that's how they do. \nJACKIE Shut your raggedy ass up and sit down. \nOrdell sits. \nJACKIE (CONT'D) Put both hands behind our head. \nJackie ends her knees and goes through a stack of records leaned up against the wall on the floor. \nJACKIE I couldn't wait till I got home last night and wash my hair. \nMAX It looks nice. \nShe finds a record, takes it out of the pile, removes the album from the sleeve, and places it on her stereo turntable. \nMAX (CONT'D) You never got into the whole CD revolution? \nJACKIE I got a few. But I can't afford to start all over again. I got too much time and money invested in my records. \nThe song starts; it's an old romantic soul music number from the early seventies. \nMAX Yeah, but you can't get new stuff on records. \nJackie picks up her cigarettes off the coffee table. \nJACKIE I don't buy new stuff that often. \nJackie enters the kitchen door frame by Max. She lights a cigarette and stands. \nMax listens to the soul song. \nMAX This is pretty. \nJACKIE Uh-huh. \nMAX Who is this? \nJACKIE The Delfonics. \nMAX \nJACKIE '74, I think. \nMAX It's nice. \nThey listen for a moment. \nJACKIE I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows, I'm still available. \nMAX Are you? \nJACKIE I don't know yet. 'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens. \nMAX What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you. \nJACKIE I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money. \nMAX Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one who wants you, that'll only interest him up to a point. \nJACKIE It's a lot of money. About a half-a- million dollars. All of it in Cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin in. \nMAX How'd you find that out? \nJACKIE He told me last night. \nMAX He called you? \nJACKIE He came by. \nMAX What?... What'd you do? \nJACKIE We talked. \nJackie goes back in the kitchen. Coffee's almost there, but not quite. She pulls down two mugs from a cabinet. \nJACKIE (CONT'D) He had his doubts at first. But he's always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can. \nMAX Why? \nJACKIE He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar? \nMAX No thanks. There's gotta be other ways to get it out. \nShe pours the coffee. \nJACKIE Maybe, but 'm the only one he's ever used. He can't trust his other people. They're crooks. He can try bringing I in himself, but Ordell sure don't want to go through no Customs line. Either he recruits another Cabo stewardess, or he continues to trust me. I made him feel he still can. \nJackie walks to the table with the two coffee mugs and sits down. \nMAX How do you get it out? \nJACKIE Same way I been don', but first they got to let me go back to work. \nMAX You're gonna offer to set him up? \nJACKIE If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em. \nMAX It's very possible Ordell's killed somebody. \nJACKIE I ain't goin' to jail, and I ain't doin' that probation thing again. \nMax watches her a moment \nJackie takes a drink of coffee. \nJACKIE (CONT'D) How do you feel about getting old? \nMAX You're not old. You look great. \nJACKIE I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you? \nMAX It's not really something I think about. \nJACKIE Really? \nMAX Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my hair. It started falling out ten years ago. So I did something about it. \nJACKIE How'd you feel about it? \nMAX I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of done it, I did it to feel better about myself, and I do. When I look in the mirror it looks like me. \nJACKIE It's different with men. \nMAX You know, I can't really feel too sorry for you in that department. \nJackie smiles. \nMAX (CONT'D) In fact, I'd make a bet that except possibly for an Afro - you look exactly the same as you did at twenty nine. \nJackie smiles into her coffee. \nJACKIE My ass ain't the same. \nMAX Bigger? \nJACKIE Yeah. \nCUT TO: \nFADE UP ON ON TV \nHelmut Berger slaps a woman in the face with a newspaper, proclaiming he's the \"mad dog.\" The film is an Italian Policier from the seventies. \nMelanie sits in a comfy chair long-ways, bare legs hanging over the arm. As she watches the TV, she picks up a big bong with it's own handle. He takes a hit. Melanie's dressed in her usual Melanie-uniform of shorts and a loose top. \nThe front door opens, and Ordell and Louis walk through it carrying shopping bags. \nORDELL We're back. \nMELANIE 'Ola! \nWe notice that Louis is sportin' new duds. Louis' new \"look\" is a retro seventies-style bowling shirt and black jeans. \nMelanie notices the change. \nMELANIE (CONT'D) Hey, hey, hey. I think somebody's got some new clothes. \nORDELL We been shoppin'. Can't have my boy running around lookin' like a bum on the street. \nLOUIS I didn't look like a bum. \nORDELL But you did have a Salvation Army- thing going. \nOrdell notices the bong in her hand and the smoke in the air. \nORDELL (CONT'D) Goddam, girl. You gettin' high already. It's only two o'clock. \nMelanie smiles. \nMELANIE It's that late? \nLouis sits on the couch. He smiles at the comeback. \nORDELL Ha-ha-ha. I'm serious, you smoke too much of that shit. That shit robs you of your ambition. \nMELANIE Not if your ambition is to get high and watch TV. \nMelanie and Louis laugh. \nThe phone rings. \nORDELL You two a coupla Cheech and Chongs, ain't ya. (he moves towards the phone - to Melanie) Oh, that's okay, I'll get it. \nHe picks it up. \nORDELL Hello. (pause) Hey, Jackie... (throwing a hard look at Melanie) \nNo, Jackie, I didn't get your message. \nMELANIE I was gonna tell you... \nOrdell gives her a \"silence\" gesture and look. \nMelanie trades a look with Louis like \"I'm in trouble,\" all the while smiling like a shark. \nLouis smiles to himself. \nMelanie holds up the bong, offering him a hit. \nOrdell's on the phone. \nORDELL No, not on the phone, let's meet somewhere. But you gotta make sure they ain't followin' you... \nLouis has the bong in front of him. \nMelanie stays in her chair long-ways. \nLOUIS Is it ready to go? \nMELANIE Yeah, there's another hit left. \nLouis takes it. \nOrdell's on the phone. \nINT. COCKATOO INN \nJackie sits at the bar talking on their phone. We see both sides. \nJACKIE The Cockatoo Inn. \nORDELL The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that? \nJACKIE It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick... \nORDELL Oh, wait, you mean that place that has the big sign with a rooster on it? \nJACKIE It's a cockatoo. \nLouis exhales his smoke, does an older man cough. \nMELANIE You okay? \nLOUIS Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't smoke or laugh now it seems without coughing. \nMELANIE Coughing opens up the capillaries. When you cough, you're getting air - in this case smoke - to parts of the lung that don't normally get used. Coughing's good - gets ya higher. My dad coughs when he smokes all the time. \nOrdell hangs up the phone. \nORDELL (to Louis) Hey, Louis, I have to go out awhile. So since you like gettin' high so much, why don't you stay here with Melanie, get high, and watch cartoons? \nLouis with a smile. \nLOUIS Way ahead of you. \nMelanie laughs. \nOrdell takes the remote control and turns the station till he finds a channel with cartoons. \nORDELL So you just watch this for the next three hours, and I'll be back. Then, when I'm through with all my business, I'll get high. I get high at night. Walk me to the door, space girl. \nMelanie climbs out of the chair and walks Ordell to the door, \nOrdell says to her in the doorway; \nORDELL (CONT'D) Hope you don't mind keeping him company. \nMELANIE No problem. \nORDELL Try not to rip his clothes off 'em they're new. \nMelanie gives him a sarcastic, \"Oh, you're so funny\" look. \nOrdell kisses her quick on the mouth, then says past her; \nORDELL (CONT'D) I'll be back in an hour, man. Just hang with Mel. \nWe join in mid-conversation. \nJACKIE The money's in a Broadway shopping bag. I get some food, and sit down here in the food court. Then your girl comes - you got somebody yet? \nORDELL Uh-huh. \nJACKIE Who? \nORDELL What'd you care? \nJACKIE Look, it's my ass facin' the penitentiary. You send some hard- headed roc whore, and she fucks things up. \nORDELL I ain't gonna send no roc whore. The woman's cool, I promise. \nINT. DEL AMO MALL - U.A. CINEMAS - DAY \nWe're outside the Del Amo UA Cinemas, a six-screen theater that's been in the Del Amo Mall since the early seventies. A small afternoon crowd is exiting the cinema, having just watched their matinee. Max Cherry is among them. He exits the theater, and strolls through the mall. \nBACK TO JACKIE AND ORDELL \nIn the food court. \nOrdell rises from the table. \nJackie moves a Broadway bag towards him. \nJACKIE Don't forget your bag. \nHe takes it. \nWe follow with Ordell out of the food court, when he stops... \n... He see Max Cherry strolling through the mall. \nOrdell almost steps into a store to get out of view. \"What the fuck is Max Cherry doing here?\" \nAs Ordell watches, he sees Max head towards the food court. \nMAX walks into the food court. He stands looking a all the international fast food choices in front of him. As he tries to decide, he hears from behind him; \nJACKIE (O.S.) Max. \nMax turns and sees Jackie siting there drinking her iced tea, smoking her Mild Seven, and smiling up at him. \nMax smiles back. \nMAX Well, hello. \nJACKIE Surprise. \nHe approaches her table. \nMAX I walked right past you. \nJACKIE I know, ignoring me. What're you up to? \nMAX Catching a movie. \nJACKIE What'd ya see? \nMAX \"American Prseident\" \nJACKIE How was it? \nMAX Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady. \nJACKIE Oh, are you? Does she know that? \nMAX No... (sitting down at the table) ... I don't believe she's ever heard of me. But that doesn't mean we're not going steady. \nBACK TO ORDELL \nWatching Max sit down and make himself comfortable at Jackie's table. \nORDELL (to himself) What's up with this shit. \nBACK TO MAX AND JACKIE \nMAX I think falling in live with movie stars is something that happens to a man as he gets older. \nJACKIE Does it happen to all men? \nMAX Well, I'd never be so bold as to speak for all men, but as or myself and a few of my friends, that's definitely the case. There's a lot of actresses out there you like, and there's some you have crushes on. But there's always one who you love. And with her it's sorta like going steady. \nJACKIE And Annette's it for you? \nMAX For now. These relationships never last too long. \nWith a smile on her face; \nJACKIE That's a goddam man for ya. Can't even be faithful to a fuckin' movie star. \nMax smiles. \nJACKIE Who was your girl before Annette? \nMAX Sandra Bullock. You know her? \nJACKIE Yeah, she's the girl who drove the bus in \"Speed.\" She's cute. \nMAX She's adorable. But I had to end it. \nJACKIE Why? \nMAX I'm old enough to be her father. \nJACKIE How old's Annette? \nMAX I don't care. \nGesturing to the Broadway bags on the table. \nMAX What're you, a bag lady? \nJACKIE I go back to work tomorrow. \nMAX You talk them into it? \nJACKIE They seem to like the idea. \nMAX Bring the money in and they follow it? \nJACKIE Yea, but I'm going to dress it up. Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here. \nMAX You don't actually do it that way? \nJACKIE He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T. F. guy to follow the shopping bag. \nMAX Make the delivery somewhere in the mall. \nMAX Which one? \nJACKIE If you had a chance, unemployed now, to walk off with a half-million dollars, would you take it? \nMAX I believe I said I'd be tempted. \nJackie smiles at him behind cigarette smoke. \nMAX Don't even think about it. You could get yourself killed go to prison... \nCLOSEUP JACKIE \nJACKIE What if I've figured a way? \nHold for a few beats, then... \nFADE TO BLACK. \nTITLE CARD: \n\"MONEY EXCHANGE 10,000\" \nOver this card, we hear an airplane landing. \nFADE UP: \nCLOSEUP JACKIE \nBack at work, standing at the exit of her plane. All the passengers are filtering out. She says goodbye. \nJACKIE Bye bye... Bye now... Goodbye Bye bye... Bye bye... Goodbye \nINT. LAX PARKING STRUCTURE - DAY \nJackie, wearing her stewardess uniform, walks into the LAX parking structure, pulling her bad on wheels behind her. \nNicolet and Dargus are waiting for her. \nNICOLET We gotta stop meeting this way. \nJackie smiles. They all fall in step towards Jackie's Honda. \nINT. JACKIE'S HONDA - DAY \nThe two cops and the black woman sit parked in her Honda. She, behind the wheel, Nicolet next to her in the passenger seat, Dargus in the backseat. Nicolet has the flight bag in his lap. He's taking out the manila envelope with the ten thousand inside. Their demeanor is very different from the first time they met. The three now almost act like friends. \nDARGUS How was your flight? \nJACKIE Fine. \nDARGUS Bet you're happy to be working again. \nNICOLET This is A.T.F. agent Ray Nicolet, Jackie Brown, Ordell Robbie money exchange trial run. It's three p.m., July 4th 1997. The location is the parking structure at LAX. \nJACKIE What are you doing? \nPointing to a small mike on his lapel. \nNICOLET I'm recording this. \nJACKIE I thought you were going to let this one through. \nDARGUS We are. Don't worry about it. \nNICOLET Every step of this goes in my report. (back to report voice) I am now taking a manila envelope from the subject's flight bag. \nHe opens it and takes out the ten thousand dollars. \nNICOLET (CONT'D) The envelope contains currency... all the same denomination, one-hundred- dollar bills. Now, I'm counting it. \nDARGUS What time do you have to be there? \nJACKIE Four thirty. I'm meeting a woman. \nDARGUS What's her name? \nJACKIE He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her? \nDARGUS She leaves, somebody'll be on her. \nJACKIE But you're not going to stop her? \nNicolet finishes counting, then hushes them up. \nNICOLET The envelope contains ten thousand dollars. The subject will be delivering the currency in a... \nJACKIE A Broadway shopping bag. \nShe holds it up. \nNICOLET A Broadway shopping bag. A large bag with handles and brown lettering. \nEXT. DEL AMO MALL - DAY \nThe huge Del Amo Mall. \nINT. DEL AMO MALL - FOOD COURT - DAY \nThe Del Amo Mall on another lazy midday in the middle of the week. \nMax rides up an escalator in the mall. He casually strolls through the mall, goes into a cappuccino bar called \"BUSTA CAP\" across from the food court. Walking up to the counter; \nMAX Caf\u008a mocha. \nBUSTA CAP GIRL You want whipped cream on that? \nMAX No, thanks. \nMax checks his watch: 4:30. He looks over at the food court and spots Jackie sitting at a table by herself. \nFLASH ON: \nINT. JACKIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nJackie on the phone with Max, dressed for bed (long t- shirt and panties). \nJACKIE Think of it as money that shouldn't even be here. I mean does anybody have a right to it? \nINT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - NIGHT \nMax in his office on the phone. \nMAX The feds. It's evidence. \nJACKIE It may be evidence once they get their hands on it, but right now it's only money. \nBACK TO MAX AT THE MALL \nHe ponders his words as he watches her from a distance. \nMAX (to himself) It could work... If she handles the cops right, I could work... \nHe hits 'play' on the dash CD player. The Delfonics fill the cab of the Caddy. \nCUT TO: \nBLACK \nA garage door is lifted open, revealing Ordell and Louis. \nEXT. STORAGE FACLITY - DAY \nOrdell and Louis are at Mr. Robbie's storage facility. A VAN is backed up nect to the opening. The facility is pitch black. Ordell ahs a big flashlight in his hand. \nORDELL Check this out. \nHe turns on the flashlight. \nHe shines the beam into darkness. We see the facility is filled to the gills with machine guns, shotguns, uzis, a rocket launcher, and handguns of many types. \nLOUIS How much is there? \nORDELL Over half-million dollars worth of merchandise. \nOrdell opens the back doors of the van. They start unloading machine guns and boxes of ammo. \nLOUIS Can I ask you about Melanie? \nORDELL Sure. \nLOUIS What's your relationship? \nORDELL She one of the women I got set up. I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent Simone a small house in Compton, and about four blocks away I got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. Took her to my house in Compton, told her it was Hollywood. \nLOUIS She believed you? \nORDELL Hell, yeah. To her dumb country ass, Compton is Hollywood. Close as she's ever been, anyway. \nThey both laugh together. \nLOUIS Do you trust Melanie? \nOrdell stops unloading. \nORDELL If this is about you fucked Melanie, I don't give a damn. I ain't a fool. I leave you alone with a bitch like Melanie, you're gonna be fuckin' that twenty minutes after I'm out the door. So say \"thank you\" and I'll tell you, \"you're welcome.\" \nLOUIS That's not what I meant when I asked did you trust her. \nOrdell looks at him. \nORDELL She tryin' to work your ass against me, ain't she? \nLOUIS Yep. \nORDELL You didn't even hafta say it. I know the woman. \nLOUIS Well, why the fuck keep her around? \nORDELL (smiling) 'Cause she my fine little surfer gal. She can't do me no harm. Fact she think she can play you against me shows how little she knows. You could teach that bitch for days how it is 'tween me an you, she never understand a damn word. \nLOUIS Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust? \nORDELL I don't hafta trust her, I know her. \nLOUIS What does that mean? \nORDELL You can't trust Melanie. But you can always trust Melanie to be Melanie. \nLouis starts unloading. \nLOUIS I still don't understand why you keep her around. \nORDELL I told you, man. (smiling) She my fine little surfer gal. \nEXT. MELANIE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY \nEXTREME CLOSEUP - Jackie's finger presses a small black button next to the handwritten name, \"M. RALSTON.\" \nEXTREME CLOSEUP SPEAKER BOX \nMELANIE'S VOICE (O.S.) (coming out of it) What? \nJACKIE \nBends down to talk in the speaker. \nJACKIE It's Jackie. \nINT. MELANIE'S APARTMENT HALLWAY - DAY \nJackie walks down the hallway and finds the door. \nShe rings the doorbell. \nThe door opens, she sees Melanie (for the first time) on the other side. Melanie, dressed in a t-shirt, cut offs, doesn't say a word - just turns around and walks away. \nOnce Melanie leaves, she sees Ordell standing inside the apartment, screwdriver in hand, yelling after Melanie; \nORDEL ... Now she's gonna pout... \nHe turns his attention to Jackie. \nORDELL (CONT'D) Hey, Jackie, c'mon in. \nJackie steps inside. \nShe sees Louis (for the first time) sitting on the couch. \nOrdell says to Louis, but loud enough for Melanie in the other room to hear; \nORDELL (CONT'D) She gonna hafta find her sandals... find her bag... find her sunglasses... take twenty damn minutes get her ass out the door. (to Jackie) Jackie - his is Louis, Louis - Jackie. And the chick stompin' around in the other room is Melanie. \nMelanie comes out of the bedroom with her sunglasses, sandals, bag strung across her shoulders and her keys in her hand. She makes a bee-line towards the door without saying nothin' to nobody. \nORDELL (CONT'D) You have a nice time, hear? \nThe door SLAMS behind her. \nOrdell looks to Jackie, raises his screwdriver and says; \nORDELL (CONT'D) Drink? \nJACKIE I need to talk to you alone. \nEXT. MELANIE'S APARTMENT - BALCONY - DAY \nOrdell and Jackie on the balcony. \nJACKIE I don't want no more fuckin' surprises. We do this the way I laid it out, or we don't do it at all. \nBEGINNING OF SHOT \nThe camera picks Jackie up through the window, walking into the place and going up to the bar... \nA female bartender in her mid-twenties, wearing a plaid workshirt, named WANDA, goes to Jackie. \nJACKIE Do you have a phone? \nWANDA Yeah, it's in the back. \nJACKIE Thanks. \n... We follow with her to the back of the bar... the MUSIC is LOUD... the phone booth is occupied by a fat older GUY wearing surf clothes and sporting a mustache like a walrus. Jackie waits for him to finish his call... As she waits, the CAMERA MOVES BACK... until a blonde head of hair comes into the f.g.... \nThe CAMERA MOVES around to a CLOSEUP ON MELANIE, sucking on a beer, moving her head to the music, and watching Jackie. She smiles and steps OUT OF FRAME. \nEND OF SHOT \nJackie hears behind her; \nMELANIE (O.S.) Hey! \nJackie turns and sees Melanie holding a beer, standing behind her. \nJACKIE Oh, hi. \nMELANIE Buy ya a beer? \nJACKIE I'm waiting for the phone. \nMELANIE Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here. \nJACKIE Well, I guess I better look for another one, then. Thanks, anyway. \nJackie turns to leave. \nMELANIE I know what you and Ordell got goin'. You sit down and have a beer with me. I'll tell you a secret. \nJackie looks at her a moment. \nJACKIE Sure. \nMELANIE Great... (calling to the bartender) ... Wanda! \nWanda approaches. \nWANDA What? \nMELANIE This lady is thirsty. \nWANDA What do you want? \nMELANIE What's on tap? \nWANDA Coors, Sam, Rolling Rock, and Killian's Red. \nJACKIE Killian's. \nMELANIE Better get me another Sam's. (to Jackie) Join me in a Jaeger shot? \nJACKIE Uh-uh. \nMELANIE Gimme one anyway. \nWANDA You got it. \nWanda goes away. Jackie and Melanie sit at the bar. The MUSIC is LOUD, and they have to talk over it. Melanie moves her head to it during the conversation. \nJACKIE How long you been with Ordell? \nMELANIE This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever. \nJACKIE What were you two fighting about? \nMELANIE He told me to go outside. (imitating Ordell's voice) \"You may leave us now.\" It's all part of his pathetic attempt to be \"the man.\" You know Mr. Walker don't you? \nJackie nods \"yes.\" \nMELANIE (CONT'D) Mr. Walker's my buddy. Ask him about Ordell. \nJACKIE That coke was yours, wasn't it? \nMelanie makes a face to show pain. \nMELANIE Oh, man, listen. I'm sorry about that. I hope they don't come down on you on my account. Ordell shoulda told you it was in your bag. \nWanda brings the drinks. \nWANDA Seven dollars. \nMelanie digs in her purse for the money. \nJACKIE He said he didn't know about it. \nMELANIE (digging in her purse) You believe that? Yeah, well, I guess you have to trust him. (pulls out a ten) I'd have second thoughts on that, but then I know 'em. \nMelanie takes her Jaeger shot, lets it go down, then continues. \nMELANIE (CONT'D) He killed a guy who works for him the other day. \nJACKIE Beaumont Livingston? \nMELANIE You already knew that? \nJACKIE Kinda. \nMELANIE So tell me. Having all that money in your flight bag - Is it tempting? \nJackie nods 'yes', as she sips her beer. \nMELANIE (CONT'D) I tell you. If Ordell ever sent me to carry in ten thousand dollars, that would be the last motherfuckin' time he saw me. The next trip you're gonna have over half-a-million. If you thought of cutting Ordell out, I sure as hell wouldn't blame you. \nJackie smiles. \nMELANIE (CONT'D) You think I'm kidding? \nJACKIE Dreaming. \nMELANIE You know how easy it would be? He won't be anywhere near that mall. Pull one more switch, up front. That's it. half-a-million dollars. Need help? \nJACKIE (smiling) Keep it between us girls? \nMELANIE What's that fucker ever done for us? \nJACKIE (getting off the barstool) I don't think so, but thanks for the beer. \nJackie leaves. \nCLOSEUP MELANIE \nMAX You're takin' a helluva chance kid. \nJACKIE Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr. Walker put the money in, and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke. \nMAX Then you're out and you get nothing. \nJACKIE Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried. \nMAX You're gonna have surveillance all over you. \nJACKIE That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room. \nMAX In a dress. \nJACKIE Well, a suit. There's one I had my eye on. \nThe phone rings. \nJACKIE (CONT'D) Excuse me. \nINT. MELANIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nEXTREME CLOSEUP - Ordell on the phone \nORDELL It's Ordell. We got a bit of a change in plans here. Nothing to worry 'bout - everything's the same - except for one change. That bitch you saw in the mall, Simone. She wasn't here today, cause she split on me. (pause) Me an Louis went over to her place ,she's gone. She's gone and all her shit's gone and so's my ten thousand dollars. (pause) It ain't nothin' to worry about, girl. Everything's just like we discussed. Except when you do the switch, instead of Simone, it's gonna be Melanie. \nMelanie is lying on the couch, sprawled out like a cat. Louis sits at the other end of the couch. They're watching \"Dirty Mary and Crazy Larry\" on TV. \nON TV \nPeter Fonda and Susan George make jokes as they're pursued by police cars. \nThey can hear Ordell on the phone. Melanie smiling at Louis, flirtatiously and conspiratorially lifts her bare foot and rubs his arm with it. Louis turns to her and gives her a look that says: \"I'm not on your side, bitch. So knock it of.\" \nMelanie sees this and takes her foot away. \nLouis turns back to the television. \nCLOSEUP MELANIE \nLooks at Louis for a moment, then sighs, saying under her breath; \nMELANIE Chicken shit. \nFADE TO BLACK \nTITLE CARD: \n\"MONEY EXCHANGE 550,000\" \nFADE UP: \nA GRAPHIC MAP \nWith Mexico and California on it. On the Mexico side we see \"CABO SAN LUCAS\" with a big circle around it. On the California side we see \"LAX\" in a similar circle. The tiny figure of a black AIRPLANE appears in the Cabo circle. With appropriate SOUND EFFECTS it takes off from Cabo, flying towards LAX, leaving a dotted line behind it. The CAMERA moves into a CLOSEUP of the little black airplane. \nCUT TO: \nCLOSEUP JACKIE \nLooking down... \nINT. AIRPLANE BATHROOM - DAY \nRearranging her bag. The five hundred thousand inside takes up half the space. She tucks lingerie around the edges, covers the money with blouses, shoes, and skirts and ties I all down tight. Then places a fat envelope with fifty thousand right on top. \nINT. CABIN - AIRPLANE - DAY \nJackie steps out of the bathroom, walks down the aisle, and is stopped by a PASSENGER. \nPASSENGER Listen, Miss, I'm waiting for a drink and you spend half the fuckin' flight in the can. Soon as we land I'm making a formal complaint. \nJACKIE Why, because I called you an asshole. \nPASSENGER You didn't call me that. \nJACKIE I didn't? Oh, well, you're an asshole. \nINT. LAX PARKING STRUCTURE - DAY \nSUBTITLE APPEARS BELOW: \n\"TIME: 3:00\" \nJackie steps into the LAX parking structure, pulling her bag on wheels behind her. \nWaiting for her is Ray Nicolet. \nNICOLET We have to stop meeting like this. \nThey fall into step towards her car. \nJACKIE You said that the last time. \nNICOLET Well, it's true, isn't it? After his is buttoned up we could meet someplace else. What do you think? \nJACKIE We could, if I'm not in jail. \nNICOLET Oh, that's taken care of. I called the State Attorney's Office. You were no-filed this morning in Circuit Court. \nCLOSEUP JACKIE \nThis information stops Jackie in her tracks. \nJACKIE Are you saying I'm off the hook? \nJACKIE'S POV \nNicolet, who kept walking when Jackie stopped, looks back at Jackie. \nNICOLET Free as a bird. I still expect you to finish the job, though. How much do you have this time? \nJackie starts walking again \nJACKIE Fifty thousand, like I said. He's pretty sure he's gonna need it for bail. \nINT. JACKIE'S HONDA - DAY \nJackie and Nicolet in the parked car. Ray has the flight bag in his lap. \nHe unzips it. \nHe sees the clothes with the envelope on top. \nJackie watches all of this. \nNICOLET That's fifty thousand, huh? It doesn't look like that much. \nJACKIE I was told ten thousand in each pack. \nLOUIS Don't say anything else, okay? I'm telling you, keep your mouth shut. \nMelanie was surprised by the spin, but is about to say something anyway when Louis put his hand up and says; \nLOUIS I mean it. Don't say one fuckin' word. \nMELANIE Okay, Lou-is. \nThat did it! \nLouis whips out the Beretta Ordell gave him, shoots her... BAM... in the belly. \nShe bounces OFF one of the cars and goes down. \nBAM... Louis shoots her again on the ground. \nOne; to make sure. Two; cause it felt good. \nThen he hurries of for his car. WE FOLLOW IN FRONT OF HIM. He looks around, then yells out; \nLOUIS See, just where I fuckin' said it was! \nHe hops in the car, and throws it into reverse. \nWe can se Melanie's bare legs sticking out from a row of cars. Louis stops the Toyota alongside the dead Melanie, and yells through the passenger window; \nLOUIS Hey, look. I found it! \nHe drives away. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. PARKING LOT - DEL AMO MALL - DAY \nMax Cherry's Cadillac Seville pulls up to a lined space in the parking lot. \nSUBTITLE APPEARS BELOW: \n\"TIME: 4:04\" \nMax gets out of his car and casually strolls towards the Del Amo Mall. \nINT. ROBINSON'S/MAY - DAY \nMax, hands in pocket, strolls unhurriedly through the Robinson's/May store. \nHe walks around the store, keeping one eye peeled toward the Designer Clothes section. He walks up to a jewelry counter and begins looking at he pieces in the display case, when a pretty, young SALESGIRL comes up to him. \nSALESGIRL Can I show you something? \nMAX Not right now. I'm just killing time waiting for my wife. But thanks, anyway. \nSALESGIRL Sure thing. If anything grabs you, don't be shy. \nMAX Thanks, I won't. \nShe goes off. \nHe looks towards Designer Clothes and sees Jackie walking out of the fitting room wearing the cool black suit. \nAMY Oh, my God. You look so cool. \nJackie moves over to the mirror and checks herself out. \nMax looks back to the jewelry display case, saying under his breath; \nMAX (CONT'D) (low) And away we go. \nJackie looks at her reflection in the mirror. Then she lifts her eyes, meeting Max's across the room. Max gives her a nod of his head to show he approves. Jackie smiles and breaks contact, turning to Amy. We hear her say from a distance. \"This looks pretty good on me.\" \nMax hears a commotion behind him and turns to see Louis and Melanie hurriedly making their way towards Designer Clothes. \nHe turns his attention back to browsing through dresses on a rack. \nHe sees Louis and Melanie squabbling. \nHe sees Jackie disappear into the fitting room. \nHe sees Amy leaving the fitting room entrance. \nHe watches Melanie, by herself, watch Amy leave. Melanie watches the fitting room for a few moments. Gathering her courage, then makes her move, entering the fitting room. \nMax smiles to himself, \"so far so good\" he thinks. He throws a look towards Louis, only to see Louis staring dead at him with an unhappy look on his face. Max returns the look with a smile and a wave then turns his back on his before he can see a reaction. \nMax continues his fake browsing. \nHe sees Melanie come out of the fitting room carrying a Robinson's/May bag close to her chest. \nShe and Louis disappear. \nHe sees Jackie come out of the fitting room, go over to Amy and buy the dress. Jackie goes into her act, acting agitated and distracted as she talks to Amy, pays with cash, then leaves stopping to say; \nJACKIE Oh, somebody left a shopping bag in there. Looks like beach towels. \nShe's gone. \nAmy is left alone by the cashier counter. \nIt's Max's turn. \nAs Max looks at Amy, then at the fitting room entrance, he says to himself; \nMAX Max, old boy. You've spent nineteen years dealing with people who take incredible risks. You walk over to that counter, you're gonna find out what it's like. \nMax takes a few moments... \n... then walks over to Amy. \nMAX Excuse me, but my wife thinks she left a bag of beach towels in the fitting room? \nAMY Yeah, I think they're back there. Go get 'em. There's nobody in there. I think they're in the last stall. \nMAX Thanks. \nMax walks toward the fitting room, enters it, walks down the length of stalls, and stops in front of the last one. \nHe opens the door to the stall. Sitting in the corner is the Robinson's/May bag. He walks over to it, lifts out the towels, and sees all that money. He replaces the towels, picks up the bag and leaves. HE walks across the Designer Clothes, passes by Amy, says; \nMAX Got 'em, thanks. \nAMY Sure thing. \nMax walks unhurriedly toward the door that leads to the parking lot. \nEXT. PARKING LOT - DEL AMO MALL - DAY \nHe's outside; nobody's stopped him. He keeps walking towards his blue Seville. He keeps walking unhurriedly, never looking back. He gets to his car, uses opening the car door as an excuse to look back at the mall. \nIt's normal. Nobody's after him, nobody's watching him. He made it. It worked. \nORDELL Pull the car over. \nLouis pulls it over, and stops on Ninth. \nORDELL (CONT'D) What'd you shoot her with? \nLOUIS It's in there. \nOrdell opens the glove box and takes out the Beretta. He smells the end of the barrel. He releases the magazine. \nLOUIS (CONT'D) What's that gonna tell you\" If I was really pullin' a burn, I'd have taken two out, wouldn't I? I thought you trusted me. \nOrdell looks at him. Louis didn't burn him. \nCLOSEUP ORDELL \nHe thinks. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nCLOSEUP JACKIE \nHolding a bunch of money, looking into the camera, and saying with a smile; \nJACKIE Gotcha, nigga. \nDISSOLVE BACK TO: \nCLOSEUP ORDELL \nJackie's gonna die. He slaps the magazine back into the Beretta. \nORDELL Okay, so it was Jackie Brown. \nLOUIS If she's got it, why didn't she take it all? \nORDELL 'fore I blow that bitch's brains out, I'll ask her. \nLOUIS Maybe the Feds got it. \nORDELL If there were nothin; in here but towels, maybe she didn't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and A.T.F. got it. But, she put these fuckin' books in here to trick our ass. \nLOUIS That's why I never checked it. The bag felt right. \nORDELL Then she throws forty thousand in here, to rub the shit in my face, know what I'm saying? She wants me to know she ripped me off. \nLOUIS I don't know. Either she has it or the Feds. \nORDELL Or... (pause) ... she gave it to somebody else first, before Melanie went in the dressing room. \nIt gets real quiet in the car, as Louis remembers something. \nLOUIS Jesus Christ. \nORDELL What? \nLOUIS You know who I saw in the dress department? \nORDELL Tell me. \nLOUIS I didn't really think anything of it. No - I did wonder what he was doing there, but didn't think it had anything to do with us. You know like maybe he was there with his wife or girlfriend. \nORDELL You gonna tell me who it was? \nLOUIS Max Cherry. \nOrdell has to look away from Louis, takes a beat, then looks back. \nORDELL You see Max Cherry in the dress department. We're about to be handed half-a-million dollars - Man, look at me when I'm talking to you! And you don't think nothing of him being there! \nLOUIS Do Max Cherry and Jackie Brown know each other? \nORDELL Hell, yes, they know each other. He bonded her out of county. \nLOUIS How am I supposed to know that? \nORDELL You know the motherfucker's a bail bondsman, don't ya? You know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell? \nLOUIS Why should I think anything's weird, if I don't know nothin' about them knowing each other? \nORDELL Man, I don't want to hear your fuckin' excuses! \nLouis gets mad. \nLOUIS I ain't givin' you fuckin' excuses, I'm givin' you reasons. \nORDELL Oh, you gonna tell me the reason you lost all the goddam money I got in the world! Let me tell you the reason, motherfucker! The reason is, your ass ain't worth a shit no more! \nLouis turns into the hard convict on the yard, and tells Ordell; \nLOUIS (hard) You best back off. \nWe hear a BAM. \nLouis jerks. \nOrdell shot him. \nLouis falls back against the car door, eyes wide open, staring at Ordell. \nOrdell takes the pistol, works the barrel up higher on Louis' side, right under him arm, and shoots him again. \nThis time Louis' head BANGS against the car door window. He slumps over - his life gone. \nOrdell looks at him. \nORDELL What the fuck happened to you, man? Shit, your ass use'ta be beautiful. \nOrdell takes the bag and gets out of the car, leaving Louis' dead body there. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nMEDIUM NICOLET \nNICOLET You didn't tell me you were gonna do some shopping. \nINT. NICOLET'S OFFICE (A.T.F. HEADQUARTERS) - DAY \nJackie, still dressed in her cool black suit, sits in a chair in Nicolet's office. Davidoff between the fingers of one hand, she holds a small, white styrofoam cup of coffee in he other. \nRay stands. \nJACKIE I thought I did. \nNICOLET You didn't. I would think with all this on your mind, you'd wait till after. \nJACKIE I got there early. I've had my eye on this suit - Wait, let's start over. I got there early. The idea was to try on the suit, see if I liked it. If I did, get them to wrap it up, and change back into my uniform. That's what Sheronda's expecting me to wear. Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag with fifty thousand, and go home. \nNICOLET But you didn't do that. \nBACK TO ORDELL AND MAX \nThe song plays LOUD. Ordell moves his head to the music slightly. Mak sits silently in the passenger seat, sneaking a look at Ordell every once in a while. \nBACK TO JACKIE \nSitting behind Max's desk in the dark. She takes out her Davidoffs and lights one up with her Bic. Her face is illuminated for a moment - then it's out. She exhales a drag. No music. \nBACK TO ORDELL \nCLOSEUP ORDELL \nHis face is ice, the music is LOUD. \nBACK TO JACKIE \nCLOSEUP JACKIE \nShe's cool as a breeze, smoking her brand.

Max says; \nMAX It's the next street. \nORDELL I know where it is. \nMAX Turn left. \nORDELL I know where to turn. \nBACK TO JACKIE \nSitting behind Max's desk. Headlights shine in the window. She is lit by them. She puts out her Davidoff and sits back in the chair. The light source cuts off. \nBACK TO ORDELL AND MAX \nSitting in the parked Cadillac. Ordell has just turned off the lights and turns to Max, Beretta in hand. \nORDELL My money's in that office, right? \nMAX Uh-huh. \nORDELL She starts givin' me some bullshit about it ain't there. It's somewhere else and we can go get it. (he holds up his Beretta) I'm shootin' you in the head right then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot her in the kneecap, find out where my godamn money is. I go walkin' in there and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you're the first man shot, understand what I'm sayin'? \nMAX Yeah. \nORDELL Now, is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car? \nMAX No. \nORDELL You sure? \nMAX Yes. \nORDELL You better be, motherfucker. \nEXT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - NIGHT \nThey both get out of the Cadillac. Ordell sticks his gun in his pants. \nORDELL Get ahead of me and open the door. \nMax steps in front of him, puts his keys in the lock and opens the door. \nORDELL (CONT'D) Step inside easy. \nMax does. \nMax sees; Jackie sitting at his desk in the dark. \nOrdell sees this, too and moves past Max. \nORDELL (CONT'D) Hey, girl, what the hell you sitting in the goddamn dark for? \nMax sees; Ordell moves past him... then he sees the bathroom door on the left side of the desk open, throwing light into the room, onto Jackie and the figure who steps out of the bathroom... Mark Dargus. \nMax sees; Ordell looks to Dargus, then back to Jackie. Then Jackie says; \nJACKIE Mark... (raising her voice) ... he's got a gun! \nMax sees; Ordell almost jumps, his arm goes to the Beretta in his pants... \n... just as Dargus raises his gun and SHOOTS him three times in the chest... \n... Ordell drops o the ground like a sack of potatoes, he lands at Max's feet. \nMax looks down and sees Ordell's head by his shoes, look of panic still on his face, dead as fried chicken. \nMax sees Dargus come over, bending on one nee next to Ordell's body. \nMax looks over at Jackie, still behind the desk. She looks eyes with Max for a moment, then stands and walks over to the body. \nThen Max sees ONE SHERIFF DEPUTY step out of the dark holding a shogun ... then another... then Winston step out of the bathroom. \nDARGUS He's dead. \nDargus looks up at Max; \nDARGUS (CONT'D) Does he have the marked bills on him? \nMax still shaken; \nMAX In his inside coat pocket. \nDargus reaches in and pulls out the envelope containing the forty-thousand marked dollars. \nMax looks at Jackie. \nShe looks down at the dead Ordell with no expression, just light up another Davidoff. \nDargus looks up at Max; \nDARGUS Why were you with him? \nMAX I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here. \nDARGUS How'd you know where he was? \nMAX I found out. \nDARGUS And you didn't tell the Police? \nMAX I told Jackie, and Jackie said you wanted him. \nDargus looks down at he man he just killed. \nJACKIE Remember when Ray said you hoped you'd get him before he got me? \n", "test1_input": "MELANIE (O.S.)

THE COCKATOO INN - DAY \nOrdell walks into the dark red cocktail lounge in the middle of the day and sees Jackie sitting at the bar drinking a white wine. Old-school soul plays on the jukebox. He sits next to her. \nORDELL I gotta remember this place. This is all right. Two minutes from your crib, ten minutes from your work. Not bad... \nA black bartender named FLOYD approaches Ordell. \nFLOYD What's your drink, brother? \nORDELL Screwdriver. \nFLOYD (to Jackie) How you doin'? \nJACKIE I'm fine. \nFLOYD Yes, you are. \nJackie smiles. \nFloyd makes Ordell's drink. \nORDELL I bet you come here on a Saturday night, you need nigga repellent keep 'em off your ass. \nJACKIE I do okay. \nORDELL You a fine lookin' woman, Jackie.

I mention the half-million - they don't give a fuck about that - They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money in. \nORDELL What did they say? \nJackie smiles. \nJACKIE Yes. \nOrdell smiles. \nThey both slap palms. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MELANIE'S BEACH APARTMENT - DAY \nCLOSEUP - Louis taking a hit off Melanie's bong. \nLouis and Melanie are back in the living room, kicking back, taking bong hits. \nAs Louis gets his hit, Melanie talks; \nMELANI ... so first he tries to get into the cocaine business but realizes right away that shit's too competitive. Piss the wrong person off, you get shot. So he says, fuck that - moves over to guns. You can sell guns wherever there's a demand. No one gives a shit. He acts like he's this big international arms dealer, when, come on, the only people he ever sold to were dopers. \nLouis finishes his hit and slides the bong back across the coffee table to Melanie. \nLOUIS He seems to be making out. \nReferring to the bong. \nMELANIE Is it dead? \nLOUIS Yeah. \nShe starts preparing a bowl. \nMELANIE Well, so far he is. But you have to admit he's not too bright. \nLOUIS I wouldn't go so far as to say that. \nMelanie still preparing her bowl. \nMELANIE He moves his lips when he reads, what does that tell ya. Let's say he's streetwise. I'll give 'im that. He's still a fuck-up. \nShe takes a major bong hit... holds in the smoke... then while holding in the smoke, says; \nMELANIE (CONT'D) He killed a man worked for him the other night. \nLOUIS So what are you trying to tell me?

He drops in and out. He tell you about that half-million dollars he's got in Mexico? \nLOUIS Uh-huh? \nMELANIE Course he did, he tells everybody who'll listen. That's what he's doin' with this stewardess. He's scheming how he can get it over here. \nLOUIS And your point is? \nMELANIE Let him and that stewardess get that money over here... \nLOUIS Uh-huh? \nMELANI ... and just take it from him. \nINT. COCKATOO INN - DAY \nJackie explaining the plan to Ordell. \nJACKI ... I make two deliveries. The first one with ten thousand, like a dry run. They watch it. See how it works. Then we do a second delivery, when I bring in the half mill. \nORDELL Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I ain't goin anywhere near that money. \nJACKIE You don't have to. I told 'em you're real careful. You never pick up money yourself. You always send someone, and I never know who it is. \nORDELL That's a good idea. \nJACKIE If you just listen, you'll see it's a damn good idea. The first time I do it they're lurking about. They see me hand the ten thousand to someone. \nORDELL Who? \nJACKIE I don't know. One of your friends. \nORDELL A woman. \nJACKIE If you want. \nORDELL Yeah, I think a woman. \nJACKIE The next trip, when I come with all the money, it'll look like I hand it to the same one I did before... \nORDELL But you don't? \nJACKIE No, I give it to someone else first. \nORDELL And they follow the wrong one thinkin' she's bringing it to me. \nJACKIE That's the idea. \nORDELL So we need two people, two women. \nJACKIE Can you cover that? \nORDELL I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this? \nJACKIE I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court. \nORDELL I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself? \nJACKIE Well, it's my plan. We're in this together. \nORDELL Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't need me a partner. \nJACKIE I ain't your partner, I'm your manager. I'm managing to get your money out of Mexico, into America, in your hands, and I'm managing to do all this under the nose of the cops. That makes me your manager, and managers get fifteen percent. \nORDELL Managers get ten percent. \nJACKIE That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent. \nORDELL I'll give ya ten. \nJACKIE Plus the same deal as before. \nORDELL I can do that. \nThey clink their glasses together. \nCLOSEUP DIGITAL CLOCK \nIt flips to 11:00 P.M. \nIt's now getting late at night. Jackie comes home. She's dressed differently than she was at the Cockatoo. In fact, she looks like she's coming home from a date. \nShe walks into her bedroom... kicks off her shoes... takes her earring off, putting them on the night-stand by the bed... she sees that her answering machine is flashing. She hits play. \nWe begin a SLOW ZOOM into the answering machine. Never seeing Jackie again. \nThe machine voice says; \nMACHINE VOICE (O.S.) You have on message. Sent at 8:06 P.M. \nMax's voice comes out of the machine. \nMAX'S VOICE (O.S.) Hi, Jackie. It's Max. I was just calling to find out how everything went today with A.T.F. If you want to call me, my home number is 555-6788, or you can reach me at my office, which is 555-B-A-I-L. That's also on the card I gave you when we first met - I don't know if you still have that - but it's on it - Oh, let me give you my beeper number. It's 555-7839. Okay, so I'll talk to you later. Hope everything's well. Bye-bye. \nMACHINE VOICE (O.S.) End of message. \nFADE TO BLACK \nFADE UP ON: \nEXT. DEL AMO MALL - DAY \nWe se the huge Del Amo Mall from the parking area. \nA SUBTITLE reads: \n\"DEL AMO MALL TORRANCE, CALIFORNIA LARGEST INDOOR MALL IN THE WORLD\" \nINT. DEL AMO MALL - FOOD COURT - DAY \nThe Del Amo Mall on a lazy midday in the middle of the week. A few people, mostly black, mill around, but it's not like it is on the weekend. \nThe international food court, where fast-food versions of international cuisine are available to all the hungry Del Amo Mall shoppers. \nJackie and Ordell sit at a table in the food court. She drinks an iced tea from Teriyaki Donut. A collection of Broadway shopping bags sit on the table. \n", "test1_id": 567, "test2_input": "Jackie enters the mall. She looks at the people buzzing around. Any one of them could be surveillance. \nShe calmly walks down the mall, then turns into the Roinson's/May store. \nINT. ROBINSON'S/MAY - DESIGNER CLOTHES - DAY \nJackie, in her Cabo Air uniform, walks up to a young Asian saleswoman named Amy in the Robinson's/May designer clothing area. \nThe saleswoman smiles when she sees Jackie. \nAMY Can I help you? \nJACKIE Yes, you have a suit I've had my eye on. \nJackie steps out of the fitting room wearing a real sharp, badass, black suit with a white blouse. \nAMY Oh, my God. You look so cool. \nJackie moves over to the mirror, and checks herself out. \nJACKIE This looks pretty good on me. \nAMY Are you kidding, it looks great. You wear this to a business meeting, you're the badass in the room. But you can go out dancing in this too. It's a total power suit. \nJackie studies her reflection. \nJACKIE I think I'm gonna just get this for today. I'm in kind of a hurry. Would you mind ringing this up while I change out of it? \nAMY Not a problem. \nJACKIE Thanks. \nJackie walks into the fitting room. \nINT. FITTING ROOM - DAY \nShe walks down the fitting room hallway with changing cubicles on her right, enters the last one. \nShe closes the door and sits down on the bench in between her flight bag full of money and the Robinson's/May bag. \nA full-length mirror is straight I front of her. She looks at herself... when someone comes into the stall next to her. \nMelanie's voice comes from the other side of the wall. \nMEALNIE (O.S.) Jackie? \nJACKIE Hi, Melanie. \nMELANIE (O.S.) Are you getting that black suit? \nJACKIE Yeah, do you like it? \nMELANIE (O.S.) It looks good on you. \nJACKIE Do you got something for me? \nMELANIE (O.S.) You betcha. \nA Robinson's/May bag, like Jackie's, filled with towels, comes sliding underneath the stall. \nJackie picks up her Robinson's/May bag, filled with books, towels and the marked forty-thousand dollars. \nShe takes the loose packet of ten-thousand marked dollars and lies it on top of the bag. \nAs she does all this Melanie continues talking. \nMELANIE (O.S.) (CONT'D) We coulda worked this. You know that, dontcha? You would've made out a lot better than you're going to, believe me. \nJackie slides the Robinson's/May bag with money under the stall. \nMelanie sees the money on top and stops talking. \nJACKIE I put a little cherry on top. You're right. What the hell he ever do for us? \nMELANIE (O.S.) (quietly) Thanks. \nJACKIE Now be careful with that bag. You don't want it ripping open on you in the middle of the store. \nWe hear the SOUND of Melanie leaving. \nJackie then transfers the half of a million dollars out of her flight bag into Melanie's Robinson's/May bag. She sticks her uniform in the flight bag. \nThen takes the towels and puts them on top of the money. She grabs her flight bag and leaves, leaving behind the Robinson's/May bag filled with half of a million dollars. \nINT. DESIGNER CLOTHES - DAY \nJackie, looking sharp in her new suit but acting a touch frantic and anxious, walks rapidly toward the sales counter where Amy waits for her. \nJACKIE I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in the suit - get out of that damn uniform. \nAMY Oh, that's not a problem. \nAs Jackie and the salesgirl complete their transaction the CAMERA CIRCLES them, SLOWLY at first, but more RAPIDLY each go-around. They complete the transaction and as Jackie starts to leave, she stops and says to Amy; \nJACKIE Oh, somebody left a shopping bag in there. Looks like beach towels. \nShe leaves. We follow her... \nINT. DEL AMO MALL - DAY \n... Jackie walks out of Robinson's/May hurriedly into the main mall. The calm, cool stride we're used to with Jackie is completely gone. \nShe stops, looks around, head darting from one direction to another. She looks in a panic. The CAMERA begins to twirl around her. She seems to be looking for something she doesn't see. She looks helpless and on the verge of tears. \nAs the twirling CAMERA circles her, she screams; \nJACKIE Ray! Ray! I need you! Come out! She took the money. \nThe CAMERA stops twirling. \nNicolet, Dargus, and two other plainclothes cops, come running out of a store towards Jackie. As they reach her, a frantic Jackie yells; \nJACKIE (CONT'D) Melanie burst in the dressing room and took the money! \nCUT TO: \nEXT. PARKING LOT - DEL AMO MALL - DAY \nLouis and Melanie pull up to a lined parking space in Melanie's Toyota. \nSUBTITLE APPEARS BELOW: \n\"TIME: 4:12\" \nLouis is the first out of the car. \nLOUIS Come on, goddammit, we're late! \nINT. DEL AMO MALL - DAY \n", "test2_true": "MELANIE Jesus Christ, get a grip, Louis. \nLOUIS We shoulda been there already and we woulda been if it hadn't been for your fuckin' around! \nThey go inside Robinson's/May... \nINT. ROBINSON'S/MAY - DAY \n... We STEDICAM into Robison's/May with them. We lose them for a moment behind racks of dresses and mannequins, but end up landing on Jackie in her black suit, looking in a mirror and talking to Amy on the Designer Clothes floor. \nAM ... You wear this to a business meeting, you're the badass in the room... \nWe PAN away and find Louis and Melanie by a dress rack, watching Jackie. \nMELANIE That's a nice outfit on her. I'm gonna go over and look at this Michi Moon display. \nLOUIS Just stay right fuckin' here, all right? \nMELANIE Are you sweating? \nLouis' hand immediately goes to his forehead and touches dampness. \nMELANIE (CONT'D) Job a little too much for you? \nLouis shoots Melanie a hard convict look. \nMelanie smiles at him, feeling the stare, but too much of a natural-born smart ass to change. \nMELANIE I'll be over here. You're too conspicuous. \nLouis looks over at the fitting room. Jackie is going inside it, and the saleswoman is walking away towards him. \nHe watches the saleswoman walk by him, then looks back in time to see Melanie enter the fitting room. \nLOUIS (under his breath) Goddammit, not till I tell ya. \nHe decides he's watching the fitting room entrance too much, so he starts throwing his look around when he sees something that stops him cold. \nMAX CHERRY \nMax is looking at dresses, paying no attention to the fitting room. \nHe thinks, 'what the fuck is Max Cherry doing here?' \nMax, doing what he's doing, looks up and sees Louis staring at him across the floor. Max smiles and gives Louis a wave before turning his back to him and continues to do what he was doing. \nHe quickly looks around the store to see anything else; any more surprise guests, possible police surveillance. Everything looks normal. The saleswoman is behind the register ringing up Jackie's purchase. The few customers there are doing customer stuff. \nThen he sees Melanie come out with a Robinson's/May bag and head down a different aisle. \nHe hurries down his aisle and cuts her off. Their whole fight is said tense and low. \nLOUIS What are you doin'? \nMELANIE I'm getting out of here. What do you think? \nLOUIS Lemme have the bag. \nMELANIE Fuck you. I can carry it. \nShe tries to push past him, and he catches her by her arm and pulls her around. \nLOUIS Goddam you. Gimme that bag, \nMELANIE Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the fuckin' bag? \nLOUIS Gimme that bag before I knock you out and take it. \nMelanie realizes Louis ain't fuckin' kiddin'. Not only that, this old guy looks close to buggin'. She lets go of the bag. \nMELANIE Okay, okay. Take it. Jesus, what's wrong with you? \nHe takes it. They start walking. We STEDICAM in front of them. \nLOUIS I'm carrying it. \nMELANIE Okay, you got it. Just take a chill pill, for christ sake. \nLouis has had enough of her slang and says tensely through gritted teeth; \nLOUIS Fuck you with your chill pill. \nIn mid-walk, Melanie asks him; \nMELANIE Remember where we came in? \nLouis stops dead. He looks around, confused. \nMELANIE (CONT'D) (like a teacher on Romper Room) Nooo, that's towards Sears. We came in through Bullocks. I know where it is. Want to follow me, Lou-is? \nPissed, he leaves FRAME. Melanie, wearing her Melanie smirk, follows behind. \nEXT. PARKING LOT - DEL AMO MALL - DAY \nLouis, clutching the shopping bag close to his chest, walks rapidly down an aisle of parked cars. \nMelanie follows close behind. \nWe STEDICAM alongside. We walk for awhile, Louis changes direction to another aisle. WE'RE NOW IN FRONT of him. We see he has a searching look on his face. \nMELANIE You have no idea where you parked, do you? \nLouis doesn't answer. \nMelanie laughs. \nMELANIE (CONT'D) Jesus, but if you two aren't the biggest fuck-ups I've ever seen in my life... How did you ever rob a bank? When you robbed banks, did you have to look for your car then too? No wonder you went to jail. \nLouis could kill her right now. Just take his gun out of his pants and shoot her in her snickering face. But instead of doing what he wants, he does what he should. He doesn't answer of look back. (If he looked back and saw that Melanie-smirk, he couldn't e responsible for what happens.)He changes directions, cuts down another aisle and hopes for both their sakes she shuts the fuck up. \nBut our Melanie just keeps on being Melanie. \nMELANIE (CONT'D) Is it this aisle, Lou-is? \nLOUIS Yeah, down the end. \nMELANIE You sure? \nThey walk it; it's not it. \nLouis changes direction and cuts between some cars to the next one. \nMELANIE (CONT'D) Is it this aisle or the next one over? \nLOUIS This one. \nMELANIE You sure? \nIn between two cars, Louis spins on her. \n", "test2_id": 568, "test3_input": "Max on the other end behind his desk. Winston sitting on the edge of the desk listening. \nMAX I've been looking for you. \nOrdell's up and off the couch pacing. \nORDELL You know who this is? \nMAX Mister Robbie, isn't it? I have the ten thousand you put up. Isn't that why you called. \nOrdell doesn't say anything. \nMAX (CONT'D) The bond collateral on Beaumont Livingston you moved over to cover Miss Brown, remember? \nORDELL She got off, huh? \nMAX They decided to no-file. Tell me where you are and I'll bring you your money. \nOrdell doesn't say anything. \nMAX (CONT'D) You still there? \nORDELL Looky here, I know you helped her and I know you know what I want Jackie can tell me any story come in that pretty head of hers. Long as at the end of that story, she hands over my money. She do that, we're still friends. Now, she don't wanna be my friend no more, tell her to think about ol' Louis. And if she tries to turn me in, I'll name her ass as my accessory. We'll go upstate together. Hand in handcuffed hand. Now that shit's a promise, understand what I'm sayin'? You tell her that, and I'll call you back. \nOrdell hangs up. Back in control. He looks to the TV. One of the COMEDIANS cracks a joke. Ordell laughs. \nMax looks at Winston. \nMAX You're right, that was Ordell. You have time, you think you could find out for me where he's staying? \nWINSTON Cops can't locate him, huh? \nMAX They don't have your winning personality. \nWINSTON Sure thing. I don't have to know what I'm doing, long as you know. \nMAX I think I do. Is that good enough? \nEXT. MOTEL - NIGHT \nA low-rent motel. We hear a phone ring inside one of the rooms. \nINT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nJackie lies on a hotel bed, wearing a long t-shirt and panties, watching TV that's chained to the wall. \nShe answers the phone. \nJACKIE Hello. \nINT. MAX'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nMax on the phone in his office, alone. \nMAX I know where he is. \nThis gets her attention. She picks up the remote to the TV set and zaps the sound. \nJACKIE How'd you find out? \nMAX All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordell's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie. \nJACKIE How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't? \nMAX People talk to Winston. He's street, same as them, they trust him. They get busted, they know somebody who can bond them out. I thought I might drop in on him. He'll no doubt be surprised to see me. \nJACKIE He's liable to shoot you. \nMAX On the phone I told him I have the ten thousand he put up for your bond. I could bring the money and the papers for him to sign. Walk out and call the Sheriff's department. \nJackie gets off the bed. \nJACKIE Ray wants him. \nMAX Everybody wants him, he's a homicide suspect. It doesn't matter who brings him in, he's gonna name you as an accessory. \nJackie lights up a Davidoff. \nJACKIE That's why A.T.F.'s gotta make the case. I'm their witness. They wouldn't have a case without me. If it's his word against mine, who are they gonna believe? \nMAX It's not that simple. \nPhone in one hand, smoke in the other, Jackie begins pacing back and forth. \nJACKIE It never was, so I'm not gonna start worrying about it now. Look, Ray more or less believes my story, and he more or less doesn't care. All he really gives a shit about is getting Ordell. \nMAX So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet? \nJACKIE Get Ordell to come to your office. \nMAX Set him up. \nJACKIE Uh-huh. \nMAX Tell him you want to see him? \nJACKIE Tell him I want to give him his money. \nMAX Why? \nJACKIE I've chickened out. I'm afraid of him. He'll like that. \nMAX What do you tell Nicolet? \nJACKIE Ordell called and wants to meet me and I'm scared. \nMAX We get Ordell to come to my office. Nicolet - is he already there, or does he come busting in while we're chatting? \nJackie takes a drag. \nJACKIE He's already there. \nMAX What if he hears something he's not supposed to? \nJACKIE Well, we don't let that happen, now do we? \nEXT. FILTHY APARTMENT - NIGHT \nMax at the front door or Raynelle's apartment. He pounds on the door. \nOrdell throws open the door. \nORDELL What the fuck you doin' knockin on the door like the goddamn police? You lookin' to get shot? \nMAX I thought you might be asleep. \nORDELL You keep fuckin' with me, you're gonna be asleep forever. \nHe looks past Max. \n", "test3_true": "ORDELL Git your ass in here. \nMax enters, Ordell slams the door. \nAs Ordell turns away from the door, Maxis reaching into his coat. Ordell brings his Beretta up at Max. \nORDELL You better freeze, motherfucker! \nMax freezes, his hand in his coat pocket. \nMAX You want your money? Your bond refund? \nHe takes his hand out, it's holding stack of bills wrapped in a rubber band. He tosses it to Ordell, who catches it with his free hand. \nORDELL That's all? \nMAX I have a bond receipt for you to sign. \nORDELL You know what the fuck I'm talkin' about. You talk to her? \nMAX She wants to give you your money. If she didn't, there'd be cops batter- ramming the door right now. \nORDELL How'd you find me? \nMAX Winston found you. \nORDELL How the fuck did he find me? \nMAX That's what Winston does. He finds people who don't want to be found. \nORDELL Well, bully for that nigga. You say she wants to give me the money, huh? \nMAX Uh-huh. \nORDELL Well, give it to me then. \nMAX She wants to give it to you herself and collect her ten percent. She also wants to explain why she had to hold on to it. \nORDELL I'd like to hear that too. Turn around and put your hands on your head. \nMax does this, Ordell pats him down. \nMAX Jackie didn't trust Melanie. She'd already tried to get Jackie to go in with her, split the half million amongst themselves. What she did was take quite a risk to see you get your money. \nORDELL Lift up your pant leg. You help her? \nMAX All I did was walk out with it. \nORDELL And you did that to protect my interest? \nMAX In a way, yes. \nORDELL My ass be dumb, but I'm not a dumbass. Go sit over there on the couch. \nMax does. \nMAX This place stinks. \nORDELL You get used to it after a while. Now tell me where my money's at. \nMAX My office. \nORDELL And where's Jackie? \nMAX She's been there since Thursday night. \nORDELL She wanted to see me, why wasn't she home? \nMAX She was afraid. \nORDELL (laughs) That I gotta see. \nMAX She still is. She doesn't want to get shot before she can tell you what happened. \nORDELL Have her bring the money here. \nMAX It's in the safe. She can't get at it. \nORDELL Call her, tell her the combination. \nMAX I'm telling you, you got her spooked. She won't leave there till you have your money and you're gone. \nORDELL You expect me to just walk in there? \nMAX If she wanted to set you up, you'd be in custody right now. When you said you'd name her as an accessory she believed you. That scares her more than anything. \nORDELL That's why she's givin' up my money huh? Not that bullshit about Melanie. I didn't trust her ass neither, but I knew how to handle her. She was my blonde-headed little surfer gal. I fuckin' told Louis he could've just given her a punch in the mouth, he didn't need to shoot her. She's at your office. \nMAX Uh-huh. \nORDELL By herself. That big mandingo nigga Winston ain't there, is he? \nMAX She's all alone. \nORDELL I call your office, she better answer the phone. \nMAX She will. \nINT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - NIGHT \nJackie on the phone with Ordell, sitting behind Max's desk. \nJACKIE I'll be here. Se ya' in a bit. \nShe hangs up the phone. Then starts dialing again... \nINT. RAY NICOLET'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nA STEDICAM glides through the apartment, it falls on a beeper \"beeping\", a gun, a wallet and car keys on a dresser drawer... it leaves that and lands on a TV screen: Tom Snyder is interviewing a guest on his show ... it leaves that and falls on two empty and one quarter- filled beer bottles... it leaves that and falls on a sleeping Ray Nicolet passed out in his reclining chair. The sound of Tom Snyder and the faint beeping are heard offscreen. \nEXT. FILTHY APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThey leave the apartment walking to Max's car. \nORDELL All the time I've known her, I never heard her sound scared like that. Ordinarily she's too cool for school. I'm driving, gimme the keys. \nMax hands him the keys. They climb in. \nINT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - NIGHT \nJackie sitting behind the desk. She opens the drawer to her right, Max's .38 sits there. She closes the drawer. \nINT. CADILLAC (MOVING) - NIGHT \nOrdell behind the wheel, Max the passenger. Ordell plays the radio, he likes the song and turns it up. \nBACK TO JACKIE \nSitting alone in the office, she gets up and turns off the lights. The office goes dark. No music. \n", "test3_id": 569}

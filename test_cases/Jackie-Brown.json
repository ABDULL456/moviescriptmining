We got a bit of a change in plans here. Nothing to worry 'bout - everything's the same - except for one change. That bitch you saw in the mall, Simone. She wasn't here today, cause she split on me.

Everything's just like we discussed. Except when you do the switch, instead of Simone, it's gonna be Melanie. \nMelanie is lying on the couch, sprawled out like a cat. Louis sits at the other end of the couch. They're watching \"Dirty Mary and Crazy Larry\" on TV. \nON TV \nPeter Fonda and Susan George make jokes as they're pursued by police cars. \nThey can hear Ordell on the phone.

CABIN - AIRPLANE - DAY \nJackie steps out of the bathroom, walks down the aisle, and is stopped by a PASSENGER. \nPASSENGER Listen, Miss, I'm waiting for a drink and you spend half the fuckin' flight in the can.

After his is buttoned up we could meet someplace else. What do you think? \nJACKIE We could, if I'm not in jail. \nNICOLET Oh, that's taken care of. I called the State Attorney's Office. You were no-filed this morning in Circuit Court. \nCLOSEUP JACKIE \nThis information stops Jackie in her tracks. \nJACKIE Are you saying I'm off the hook? \nJACKIE'S POV \nNicolet, who kept walking when Jackie stopped, looks back at Jackie. \nNICOLET Free as a bird. I still expect you to finish the job, though. How much do you have this time? \nJackie starts walking again \nJACKIE Fifty thousand, like I said. He's pretty sure he's gonna need it for bail. \nINT.

To put one of these in my pocket? \nJACKIE Uh-huh. \nNICOLET If I did, I'd have to give you one, wouldn't I? Or we could take what we want.

All those things are true. \nNICOLET After all, it don't belong to nobody, right? \nJACKIE That would be one point of view. \nNICOLET Yeah, well, it's not a point of view that A.T.F. shares. Once we make it evidence, it belongs to us. You are now officially out of trouble. Don't do nothing stupid, now. \nJACKIE How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second? \nNICOLET I'm glad you realize that. Saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you.

MELANIE'S APARTMENT - DAY \nLouis stands in the empty living room, talking to Ordell on the phone. Kate Bush plays in the b.g. \nLOUIS I was ready to leave ten minutes ago. \nOrdell snaps at Louis, not so harsh Louis is forced to retaliate, but enough to express his loss of patience. \nORDELL Well, you the one in motherfuckin' charge. \nLOUIS Well, she keeps saying 'in a minute.' \nORDELL Go in there, snatch her by the hair, and drag her big ass out. This is my goddam money we're talking about. Get your ass out the door. \nHe hangs up on Louis. \nLouis, pissed at being hung up on and talked to like that, hangs up the phone and turns his frustration where it rightly belongs - Melanie. \nLouis stomps towards the bedroom where the music's playing. \nLOUIS We're leaving now! \nMELANIE (O.S.) All right already. \nMONTAGE \nWe see a montage of the individual characters in route to the mall. \nJACKIE \nIn her Honda, smoking a cigarette, looking cool as usual, driving to the mall. Her car plays seventies soul. \nMAX \nIn his Cadillac Seville, cruising down Hawthorne Boulevard to the mall. He plays hid Delfonics CD. \nLOUIS AND MELANIE \nIn Melanie's Toyota drive towards the mall. Melanie drives singing along with Kate Bush on her car stereo. \nEXT. DEL AMO MALL PARKING LOT - DAY \nJackie's car pulls up to a lined parking space in the parking lot. \nSUBTITLE APPEARS BELOW: \n\"TIME 3:52\" \nJackie gets out of the Honda with her flight bag. She goes to her hatchback, takes a Robinson's/May bag, lines the first half of the bag with old paperbacks. \nThen takes out of the flight bag the envelope with the fifty-thousand marked dollars, takes one packet of ten thousand, and puts it in her pocket. She lines the envelope with forty thousand across the books, then fills the rest of the bag with beach towels. \nThen with her flight bag slung over her shoulder, carrying the Robinson's/May bag and with all the confidence of a world champion prize fighter going into the ring, she strides toward the hugs mall. \nINT.

You look so cool. \nJackie moves over to the mirror, and checks herself out. \nJACKIE This looks pretty good on me. \nAMY Are you kidding, it looks great. You wear this to a business meeting, you're the badass in the room. But you can go out dancing in this too. It's a total power suit. \nJackie studies her reflection. \nJACKIE I think I'm gonna just get this for today. I'm in kind of a hurry. Would you mind ringing this up while I change out of it? \nAMY Not a problem. \nJACKIE Thanks. \nJackie walks into the fitting room. \nINT. FITTING ROOM - DAY \nShe walks down the fitting room hallway with changing cubicles on her right, enters the last one. \nShe closes the door and sits down on the bench in between her flight bag full of money and the Robinson's/May bag. \nA full-length mirror is straight I front of her. She looks at herself... when someone comes into the stall next to her. \nMelanie's voice comes from the other side of the wall. \nMEALNIE (O.S.) Jackie? \nJACKIE Hi, Melanie. \nMELANIE (O.S.) Are you getting that black suit? \nJACKIE Yeah, do you like it? \nMELANIE (O.S.) It looks good on you. \nJACKIE Do you got something for me? \nMELANIE (O.S.) You betcha. \nA Robinson's/May bag, like Jackie's, filled with towels, comes sliding underneath the stall. \nJackie picks up her Robinson's/May bag, filled with books, towels and the marked forty-thousand dollars. \nShe takes the loose packet of ten-thousand marked dollars and lies it on top of the bag. \nAs she does all this Melanie continues talking. \nMELANIE (O.S.) (CONT'D) We coulda worked this. You know that, dontcha? You would've made out a lot better than you're going to, believe me. \nJackie slides the Robinson's/May bag with money under the stall. \nMelanie sees the money on top and stops talking. \nJACKIE I put a little cherry on top. You're right. What the hell he ever do for us? \nMELANIE (O.S.) (quietly) Thanks. \nJACKIE Now be careful with that bag. You don't want it ripping open on you in the middle of the store. \nWe hear the SOUND of Melanie leaving. \nJackie then transfers the half of a million dollars out of her flight bag into Melanie's Robinson's/May bag. She sticks her uniform in the flight bag. \nThen takes the towels and puts them on top of the money. She grabs her flight bag and leaves, leaving behind the Robinson's/May bag filled with half of a million dollars. \nINT. DESIGNER CLOTHES - DAY \nJackie, looking sharp in her new suit but acting a touch frantic and anxious, walks rapidly toward the sales counter where Amy waits for her. \nJACKIE I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in the suit - get out of that damn uniform. \nAMY Oh, that's not a problem. \nAs Jackie and the salesgirl complete their transaction the CAMERA CIRCLES them, SLOWLY at first, but more RAPIDLY each go-around. They complete the transaction and as Jackie starts to leave, she stops and says to Amy; \nJACKIE Oh, somebody left a shopping bag in there. Looks like beach towels. \nShe leaves. We follow her... \nINT. DEL AMO MALL - DAY \n... Jackie walks out of Robinson's/May hurriedly into the main mall. The calm, cool stride we're used to with Jackie is completely gone. \nShe stops, looks around, head darting from one direction to another. She looks in a panic. The CAMERA begins to twirl around her. She seems to be looking for something she doesn't see. She looks helpless and on the verge of tears. \nAs the twirling CAMERA circles her, she screams; \nJACKIE Ray! Ray! I need you! Come out! She took the money. \nThe CAMERA stops twirling. \nNicolet, Dargus, and two other plainclothes cops, come running out of a store towards Jackie.

We lose them for a moment behind racks of dresses and mannequins, but end up landing on Jackie in her black suit, looking in a mirror and talking to Amy on the Designer Clothes floor. \nAM ... You wear this to a business meeting, you're the badass in the room... \nWe PAN away and find Louis and Melanie by a dress rack, watching Jackie. \nMELANIE That's a nice outfit on her. I'm gonna go over and look at this Michi Moon display. \nLOUIS Just stay right fuckin' here, all right? \nMELANIE Are you sweating? \nLouis' hand immediately goes to his forehead and touches dampness. \nMELANIE (CONT'D) Job a little too much for you? \nLouis shoots Melanie a hard convict look. \nMelanie smiles at him, feeling the stare, but too much of a natural-born smart ass to change. \nMELANIE I'll be over here. You're too conspicuous. \nLouis looks over at the fitting room. Jackie is going inside it, and the saleswoman is walking away towards him. \nHe watches the saleswoman walk by him, then looks back in time to see Melanie enter the fitting room. \nLOUIS (under his breath) Goddammit, not till I tell ya. \nHe decides he's watching the fitting room entrance too much, so he starts throwing his look around when he sees something that stops him cold. \nMAX CHERRY \nMax is looking at dresses, paying no attention to the fitting room. \nHe thinks, 'what the fuck is Max Cherry doing here?' \nMax, doing what he's doing, looks up and sees Louis staring at him across the floor. Max smiles and gives Louis a wave before turning his back to him and continues to do what he was doing. \nHe quickly looks around the store to see anything else; any more surprise guests, possible police surveillance. Everything looks normal. The saleswoman is behind the register ringing up Jackie's purchase. The few customers there are doing customer stuff. \nThen he sees Melanie come out with a Robinson's/May bag and head down a different aisle. \nHe hurries down his aisle and cuts her off. Their whole fight is said tense and low. \nLOUIS What are you doin'? \nMELANIE I'm getting out of here. What do you think? \nLOUIS Lemme have the bag. \nMELANIE Fuck you. I can carry it. \nShe tries to push past him, and he catches her by her arm and pulls her around. \nLOUIS Goddam you. Gimme that bag, \nMELANIE Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the fuckin' bag? \nLOUIS Gimme that bag before I knock you out and take it. \nMelanie realizes Louis ain't fuckin' kiddin'. Not only that, this old guy looks close to buggin'. She lets go of the bag. \nMELANIE Okay, okay. Take it. Jesus, what's wrong with you? \nHe takes it. They start walking. We STEDICAM in front of them. \nLOUIS I'm carrying it. \nMELANIE Okay, you got it. Just take a chill pill, for christ sake. \nLouis has had enough of her slang and says tensely through gritted teeth; \nLOUIS Fuck you with your chill pill. \nIn mid-walk, Melanie asks him; \nMELANIE Remember where we came in? \nLouis stops dead. He looks around, confused. \nMELANIE (CONT'D) (like a teacher on Romper Room) Nooo, that's towards Sears. We came in through Bullocks. I know where it is. Want to follow me, Lou-is? \nPissed, he leaves FRAME. Melanie, wearing her Melanie smirk, follows behind. \nEXT. PARKING LOT - DEL AMO MALL - DAY \nLouis, clutching the shopping bag close to his chest, walks rapidly down an aisle of parked cars. \nMelanie follows close behind. \nWe STEDICAM alongside. We walk for awhile, Louis changes direction to another aisle. WE'RE NOW IN FRONT of him. We see he has a searching look on his face. \nMELANIE You have no idea where you parked, do you? \nLouis doesn't answer. \nMelanie laughs. \nMELANIE (CONT'D) Jesus, but if you two aren't the biggest fuck-ups I've ever seen in my life... How did you ever rob a bank? When you robbed banks, did you have to look for your car then too? No wonder you went to jail. \nLouis could kill her right now. Just take his gun out of his pants and shoot her in her snickering face. But instead of doing what he wants, he does what he should. He doesn't answer of look back. (If he looked back and saw that Melanie-smirk, he couldn't e responsible for what happens.)He changes directions, cuts down another aisle and hopes for both their sakes she shuts the fuck up. \nBut our Melanie just keeps on being Melanie. \nMELANIE (CONT'D) Is it this aisle, Lou-is? \nLOUIS Yeah, down the end. \nMELANIE You sure? \nThey walk it; it's not it. \nLouis changes direction and cuts between some cars to the next one. \nMELANIE (CONT'D) Is it this aisle or the next one over? \nLOUIS This one. \nMELANIE You sure? \nIn between two cars, Louis spins on her. \n", "test2_id": 568, "test3_input": "ORDELL Pull the car over. \nLouis pulls it over, and stops on Ninth. \nORDELL (CONT'D) What'd you shoot her with? \nLOUIS It's in there. \nOrdell opens the glove box and takes out the Beretta.

The bag felt right. \nORDELL Then she throws forty thousand in here, to rub the shit in my face, know what I'm saying? She wants me to know she ripped me off. \nLOUIS I don't know. Either she has it or the Feds. \nORDELL Or... (pause) ... she gave it to somebody else first, before Melanie went in the dressing room. \nIt gets real quiet in the car, as Louis remembers something. \nLOUIS Jesus Christ. \nORDELL What? \nLOUIS You know who I saw in the dress department? \nORDELL Tell me. \nLOUIS I didn't really think anything of it. No - I did wonder what he was doing there, but didn't think it had anything to do with us. You know like maybe he was there with his wife or girlfriend. \nORDELL You gonna tell me who it was? \nLOUIS Max Cherry. \nOrdell has to look away from Louis, takes a beat, then looks back. \nORDELL You see Max Cherry in the dress department. We're about to be handed half-a-million dollars - Man, look at me when I'm talking to you! And you don't think nothing of him being there! \nLOUIS Do Max Cherry and Jackie Brown know each other? \nORDELL Hell, yes, they know each other. He bonded her out of county. \nLOUIS How am I supposed to know that? \nORDELL You know the motherfucker's a bail bondsman, don't ya? You know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell? \nLOUIS Why should I think anything's weird, if I don't know nothin' about them knowing each other? \nORDELL Man, I don't want to hear your fuckin' excuses! \nLouis gets mad. \nLOUIS I ain't givin' you fuckin' excuses, I'm givin' you reasons. \nORDELL Oh, you gonna tell me the reason you lost all the goddam money I got in the world!

He slumps over - his life gone. \nOrdell looks at him. \nORDELL What the fuck happened to you, man?

I would think with all this on your mind, you'd wait till after. \nJACKIE I got there early. I've had my eye on this suit - Wait, let's start over. I got there early. The idea was to try on the suit, see if I liked it. If I did, get them to wrap it up, and change back into my uniform. That's what Sheronda's expecting me to wear. Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag with fifty thousand, and go home. \nNICOLET But you didn't do that. \n", "test3_true": "Nicolet looks at Jackie for a moment. \nNICOLET Where's the bag she gave you? \nJACKIE She didn't give me one. I told you before, Melanie wasn't part of the plan. Ordell must of told her to do it. She bursts in, grabs the shopping bag, and takes off. What am I supposed to do, go after her? I'm in my fucking underwear. I had to get dressed before I could do anything. So I put this back on 'cause could put this on faster than I could my uniform. \nNICOLET You took the time to pay the saleswoman. \nJACKIE I had to. I was frantic. I didn't know what to do. \nNICOLET What did you do after that? \nJACKIE I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling. \nNICOLET There was a guy with Melanie? \nJACKIE Not in the fitting room. \nCUT TO: \nA YOUNG WOMAN A.T.F SURVEILLANCE AGENT \nPretends to shop. She watches Louis grab Melanie. \nNICOLET (V.O.) We had our agent on you. She sees a blonde come out of the fitting room carrying a Robinson's/May bag and tussle with a tough-looking white guy. The white guy takes the shopping bag and they go. \nBACK TO OFFICE \nNICOLET This guy with Melanie, that was Louis Gara? \nJACKIE I didn't see him. I was in my underwear. If it was a white guy, it was probably Louis. He kill Melanie? \nNICOLET It's possible. You're saying you don't have any idea what happened to that fifty thousand? \nJACKIE I have no idea. \nNICOLET You'd take a polygraph on it? \nJACKIE If it'll make you happy. \nNICOLET I sure hope you haven't done anything dumb Jackie. \nDargus comes to the doorway... \nDARGUS (to Nicolet) Can I have a word with you? \nNICOLET Sure. \nThey both leave, leaving Jackie all by herself in the room, smoking. \nThey both come back in. \nNicolet continues, Dargus takes a seat in the corner saying nothing. \nNICOLET (CONT'D) Louis Gara's dead. L.A.P.D. found him dead in a car on Ninth. And we've lost Ordell. \nJACKIE I thought you were watching him. \nNICOLET We were, and we lost him. He walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out. The bar was on Ninth, less than a mile- and-a-half from where Louis was found dead. It looks like Louis's friend shot him twice at point blank range. \nJACKIE So what happens now? \nNICOLET We pick up Ordell. We've got three murders we can link him to. We have the storage unit where he keeps his guns, by tomorrow we'll have a search warrant to go in and get him. And we have you. \nJACKIE What about me? \nNICOLET What about you? \nJACKIE Do you think I took some of that money? \nNICOLET I have no evidence of your taking anything. You didn't pay for your snazzy new suit with marked bills; I was glad to see that. You've been helping us out, you gave us Melanie and Louis. Melanie had a packet of marked bills stuffed in her shorts when they found her, which goes a long way backing up your story. \nJackie listens. \nNICOLET (CONT'D) I'll settle for Ordell with the marked bills. \nNICOLET If you have something else going on you haven't told me about, it's between you and Ordell. All I gotta say is, you better hope we find him before he finds you. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nCLOSEUP ORDELL \nOn the phone. \nORDEL ... I can't leave here today...

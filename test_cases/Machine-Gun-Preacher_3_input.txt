Deng looking through binocs at the ridge -- 
DENG (calling out to Sam) I think you got him! 
EXT. RIVERBED - DAY 
Sam, Deng, and Marco moving toward the children, weapons drawn, scanning the area in all directions. Deng is the first one to reach the boys who are huddled on the ground, shaking from fear... 
DENG (ARABIC) It is ok. You can get up now. 
But the boys don't move... and Deng reaches down, pulls them to their feet and we see that their ankles are chained to a post which has been buried in the ground. 
DENG (CONT'D) Sam. 
Sam joins Deng, sees the chains. 
DENG (CONT'D) LRA wanted us here. 
Sam realizing that these children were used as bait -- for him. 
EXT. RAVINE RIDGE - DAY 
We're at the top of the ravine now and we see Sam and the others moving toward the location of the SNIPER... 
... and Sam is the first to reach the body... laying on the ground face down... a pool of blood soaking the dirt underneath... and he rolls the body onto it's back and we see it's just a kid -- no older than 15 years old. 
INT. SAM'S TUKUL - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT 
It's late at night and we see Sam on his cot, sitting here in the dark. And we hear the sound of his satellite phone vibrating on the table next to him. He picks it up, sees DONNIE'S name on the screen... 
SAM (INTO PHONE) Hello? 
INT. UNKNOWN LOCATION - PENNSYLVANIA - DAY 
And we see Donnie on a couch by himself in this shitty little room. 
DONNIE Sam, it's me. 
INTERCUT THE CONVERSATION: 
SAM Everybody ok? 
DONNIE Oh yeah, everybody's just fine. I was just callin to say `hey' is all. 
SAM How're the girls? 
DONNIE They're good. Paige cooked us all dinner the other night. Chocolate-chip pancakes. 
SAM By herself, huh? 
DONNIE Yep. I helped her with the stove is all. She did everything else. Pretty good too. 
And now we see Donnie's DOPE WORKS sitting on the table in front of him. He's using again. 
DONNIE (CONT'D) How's it goin over there? 
SAM Goin fine. 
DONNIE Hey, maybe I'll come with you one of these trips. I'd like to get outta here for a spell. See what it's like. 
SAM Sounds good. 
And it's silent between them... both of these men lost in their own worries for a moment... and then... 
DONNIE Ask you a question? 
SAM'S VOICE Yeah. 
DONNIE'S VOICE You think God will forgive us for the things we've done? 
And we're watching Sam, this question hitting him like a freight train. Unable to answer. 
EXT. NIMULE - SUDAN, AFRICA - DAY - DAYS LATER 
We're hit by a crush of people, a thousand black faces moving past us and all the noise and confusion of this busy border town. And we find Sam, Deng, and Nineteen here loading supplies into the back of the SUV. 
VOICE (O.S.) They talk about you... 
Sam turning to find Agnete, the aid worker, approaching him. 
AGNETE In the camps. The children. They say there is a white preacher who hunts the LRA. This place does not need more killing, Mr. Childers. 
SAM I'm just tryin to help these people. Same as you. 
AGNETE War upon war does not fix what is broken here. The history of this country is filled with righteous killers. That is how it always begins, with men thinking they are killing for the right reasons. 
SAM I got a 200 kids who are gonna sleep safe tonight and wake up tomorrow mornin to a bowl of hot food. Right or not, that's all the reason I need. 
AGNETE And what about the rumors I have heard about you supplying weapons to the SPLA? 
Sam turning to her, face-to-face, starting to get pissed... 
SAM You fight the evil in this place your way, I'll fight it mine. 
AGNETE Do not delude yourself, Mr. Childers. You're a mercenary, not a humanitarian. 
Sam, finished with this conversation, slams the lift-gate closed on the truck and starts to climb in... 
AGNETE (CONT'D) They say you are doing good. That you have special powers. That you are protected by angels and cannot be killed by bullets.

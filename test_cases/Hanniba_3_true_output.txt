SHE SITS IN FRONT OF A HALF-OPENED DOOR, WHICH WE SEE IS THE DOOR TO A LINEN CLOSET. 
CORDELL (cont'd) ...y'get enough breakfast, Rosie...? 
BEAT.  XCU ON THE OLD WOMAN, AS SHE LOOKS AT STARLING, AND THEN NODS TO CORDELL, AS IF TO SAY, "THAT IS THE CORRECT CODE." 
ANGLE INS. 
HER HAND DROPS TO THE BACK OF THE WOODEN CHAIR, AND PRESSES A BUTTON CONCEALED IN THE LEG. 
ANGLE 
THE GROUP IN THE CORRIDOR, THE "LINEN CLOSET," OPENS, TO REVEAL, BEYOND IT, WHAT APPEARS TO BE A SURGICAL FACILITY, OR HIGH-TECH HOSPITAL ROOM. 
INT THE HIGHTECH ROOM. 
THERE IS A NURSE, SITTING AT A STATION, MONITORING VARIOUS LIFESIGN DISPLAYS.  SHE LOOKS UP BRIEFLY, AS CORDELL AND STARLING ENTER . 
NURSE (TO CORDELL) Five minutes... 
CORDELL NODS, AND TAKES STARLING DEEPER INTO THE ROOM.  WE BEGIN TO HEAR THE SUSURRUS OF A MECHANICAL BREATHING APPARATUS.  CAMERA GOES WITH STARLING INTO THE ROOM, WHERE WE SEE A HOSPITAL BED, WITH A SCREEN IN FRONT OF IT, AND VARIOUS TELEVISION DISPLAYS ABOVE IT, ANGLED TO BE SEEN FROM THE BED. 
STARLING APPROACHES THE BED, AND LOOKS DOWN AT THE FIGURE IN IT.  WE SEE HER FACE, BUT THE FIGURE IS SCREENED.  THE FIGURE, VERGER, SPEAKS BREATH BY BREATH, WITH AN OBVIOUS ELECTRONIC ENHANCEMENT. 
VERGER Aren't they beautiful, Miss Starling... 
STARLING LOOKS UP AT THE CHILDREN PLAYING. 
ANGLE HER POV. 
ONE OF THE CHILDREN FALLS OFF A SMALL PLASTIC SLIDE, AND CRIES, A NURSE RUNS TO HIM. 
VERGER (cont'd) Well, now, you see, one of them's hurt. And what will make it better?  Love. Isn't that odd. (PAUSE) He think's he's hurt his knee--but the assurance, the assurance, the assurance that someone cares  (WHEEZE WHEEZE) Suggests the hurt was elsewhere. 
STARLING Mr. Verger, thank you for your time. 
VERGER For the worst hurt, of course, that which will not heal, is the conviction no one cares. 
STARLING I've come to see you, sir, about an Auction... 
SHE HOLDS UP THE CATALOGUE TO HIM. 
ANGLE INS 
"DRAWINGS AND MEMORABILIA RELATING TO THE SERIAL KILLER, HANNIBAL LECHTER." 
ANGLE 
ON CORDELL, AS HE COMES CLOSE, DONNING SURGICAL GLOVES, AND TAKES THE CATALOGUE, AND HOLDS IT TOWARD VERGER. 
VERGER Ah, yes, ah yes.  Our Doctor Lechter... And have they sent you, once again to capture him?  How terrible for you... 
STARLING No, sir, it's not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible? 
VERGER Because we must leave the past in the past.  (WHEEZE WHEEZE) (CORDELL TURNS A PAGE) Ah.  And here we have artifacts of, yes, my own encounter with him... 
CORDELL TURNS THE PAGE QUICKLY. 
VERGER (cont'd) No, no.  That's alright.  Yes.  Lechter's drawings of me.  Before... and, of course, after... Now:  you are not sent to pursue him.  Then your visit baffles me. 
STARLING Sir, various drawings, done by Dr. Lechter, while in prison, stolen from the prison after his escape, have surfaced and are being sold at auction.  Several large reserve bids have been placed on them.  I have to ask if you've placed those bids. 
VERGER Because? 
STARLING Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property. 
VERGER And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness? 
STARLING Because, sir, you are the only one of his victims who lived.  And because you have large resources. 
VERGER Large resources, Starling, which I prefer to devote elsewhere.... 
STARLING LOOKS UP, AS WE SEE THE IMAGE ON THE TELEVISION CHANGE TO THE CHILDREN EATING THE COOKIES, AND THE IMAGE CHANGES AGAIN TO SHOW A SMALL DISPENSARY, AND THE KNEE OF THE CHILD WHO FELL BEING BANDAIDED BY A NURSE. 
STARLING Due respect, sir... 
SHE PRODUCES A COPY OF THE WANTED:  HANNIBAL LECHTER POSTER WE SAW AT THE FBI. 
STARLING (cont'd) Due respect, after your, after your... 
VERGER My encounter. 
STARLING Someone offered three million dollars bounty on Dr. Lechter's head. (PAUSE) 
CORDELL The identity of the person offering the bounty was never established. 
VERGER Yes, but we know who it was, and I will tell you, Agent Starling, what you know to be true.  I offered the bounty.  It was illegal, and, worse, it was wrong. And I thank God every day that I did not compound my sinful life by the stain of a murder.  Do you (WHEEZE) Agent Starling:  do you know God? (PAUSE) 
STARLING ...sir...? 
VERGER Isn't it funny?  You can look on my face (WHEEZE WHEEZE) which you would grant me, is the most hideous sight you will see in what I hope is a long life. You can look at me.  Which shows (WHEEZE) a Strength which must come from strong (WHEEZE) strong convictions.  (WHEEZE) But you shy when I say the name of God. 
THE NURSE COMES UP, HOLDING THE TAPE OF A LIFESIGNS MACHINE, SHE NODS TO CORDELL AND INDICATES THE MONITORS. 
NURSE (TO STARLING) ...I'm sorry.. (MEANING, YOU MUST GO.) 
STARLING Yes, then, you're saying that you haven't bid upon these drawings. 
VERGER I have not, I would not.  For life (WHEEZE) life goes on Starling.  And, wait, wait, I wish to talk to you... I'm... (WHEEZE)  (TO THE NURSE, WHO IS TAKING STARLING'S ARM) One moment.  I was afflicted, do you see, but my affliction was not in my meeting with your Dr. Lechter.  I was afflicted before. Before.  Do you see?  In my arrogance. Do not (WHEEZE) Do not curse God when you are humiliated.  Listen to me: embrace it, and you embrace life.... Listen, and you hear the word of God... 
STARLING IS LED AWAY BY THE CONCERNED NURSE.  CORDELL LINGERS BEHIND, AT AN UNSEEN BEHEST OF VERGER. 
THE NURSE STARTS PREPARING A HYPO AT HER STATION. 
STARLING ...will he be alright...? 
THE NURSE, DISTRACTED, NODS, AND RETREATS TOWARD VERGER WITH THE HYPO. 
CORDELL COMES OUT TO STARLING. 
INT CORRIDOR, COUNTRY HOUSE, DAY.  STARLING AND CORDELL ARE WALKING, BEYOND THEM, WE SEE VARIOUS CHILDREN PLAYING UNDER ADULT SUPERVISION.  A CARETAKER TYPE IS HOLDING A SMALL GOAT, WHICH THE CHILDREN ARE PLAYING WITH. 
CORDELL OPENS THE GLASS DOOR, AND HE WALKS STARLING THROUGH THE SCENE OF THE CHILDREN AND THE GOAT. 
CORDELL Mr. Verger wanted me to give you this... (HE HANDS HER A SMALL PRINTED CARD)

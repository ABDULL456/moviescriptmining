40   CONTINUED:                                                 40 VISITOR We're   spending the night at the house   of Nepos, not far from here. Don't   hesitate to send your man for us...   at any time... We're anxious that   things should go well for you. 
LUCINNIUS Thank you.   Good night. VISITOR We'll call in the morning at any rate... just to make sure. LUCINNIUS Thank you. 
Hector is closing the door when one of the Visitors talks roughly to him. VISITOR You.    Come here. Hector instinctively looks to his master. Lucinnius doesn't protest, but retreats into the house. Hector is left alone with the Visitors. VISITOR He looks like the kind that'll want some help. Have you ever killed before? HECTOR Only chickens. VISITOR He's not much different. Use a thin blade, but long. Get it in deep... the heart... feel for a space between the ribs... 
He prods at Hector's body freely, showing him what to do. If it is ticklish, Hector doesn't let on. VISITOR ... or go in from the back... any place he'll let you... We leave Hector nodding obediently as this weirdest of coaching lessons continues. 
VISITOR Getting it out's not as easy as you might think... you have to twist a bit... to get over the stickiness... 
41   INT. STUDY - NIGHT                                            41 Late at night in Lucinnius's study, an oil     lamp and a candle cast their shadowy light, adding to     the tension in the room. Hector stands beside Lucinnius,      who is counting out coins and other valuables on     his table. LUCINNIUS Eight hundred sesterces... cash ... that's all that's left... what a failure... my father left me three farms and forty thousand... 
Lucinnius places the money in a box on his table. He is quite drunk, resigned now to his fate. Hector however is cold sober, grim-faced. Lucinnius looks up at him. 
LUCINNIUS Nothing else to be done.    Don't you want some wine? HECTOR No... but I want something... LUCINNIUS What is it? HECTOR I want to die a free man... I don't want to die a slave... 
Lucinnius looks at him grimly and manages a smile. He              * clears his throat and attempts to put a note of ceremony into his voice. LUCINNIUS Hector,    by this proclamation, I make you    a freed man... I don't know the    exact words... I've never done it    before... But you're free, Hector. HECTOR In writing... so that when they find me... they know I died a free man... please... 
Lucinnius looks at him for a moment, then reaches out for his paper and pen. LUCINNIUS Very well... 
He scratches out a few words on the paper, Hector looking over his shoulder, keenly watching what he writes. Lucinnius finishes writing and lays down the pen.

41   CONTINUED:                                                      41 LUCINNIUS They'll find it in the morning. It's a nice thought, Hector... you were right to ask. HECTOR Thank you. 
LUCINNIUS Well... freed man, let's do it.                         * 
Lucinnius picks up a large kitchen knife which lies on the table. He fingers its blade. A trickle of fear passes across Hector's face.       Will the half-drunk Lucinnius want to kill him first? 
HECTOR What do you want me to do? LUCINNIUS Nothing... I mean, not to me... I have to do it first... you understand that... and then you... if I don't succeed... then you must help me... HECTOR I understand. LUCINNIUS No point in messing up the room. Let's go downstairs. 
Lucinnius stands and leaves the room.     Hector follows with the oil lamp. 
42   INT. PASSAGE - NIGHT                                            42 The house is quiet and in darkness as they walk along the passage and down the stairs to the washing room. Hector walks behind, casting the light on Lucinnius's crumpled, defeated form. Lucinnius begins to sob, at first quietly, then more loudly and more pathetically. Hector looks around and behind him, afraid, or perhaps hoping, that Lucinnius's moans will wake the household. 
43   INT. WASH ROOM - NIGHT                                          43 
Lucinnius has worked himself into a dramatic state of distress, with drink and terror and self pity. (CONTINUED) 
43   CONTINUED:                                                     43 He runs into the tiled washing room, wails loudly and makes a stabbing motion at his stomach. Hector sees all of this from behind as he enters the room. Lucinnius crumples to the floor and squats on his knees. He calls out in pain. 
LUCINNIUS Oh, that hurts, that stings! Lucinnius sits back on the step of the washing pool, holding his stomach. Hector sits down beside him. They both look down at the blade, still in Lucinnius' body. LUCINNIUS This is hopeless. 
They sit absurdly like this for a long moment, neither of them knowing what do do next. It's awkward, like in a waiting room. Then Lucinnius speaks. LUCINNIUS Help me, Hector... HECTOR You've done it... you've done it ... lie down... Hector speaks gently, like coaxing a frightened animal. He helps Lucinnius lie out on the marble floor. HECTOR Close your eyes... you did it... LUCINNIUS Thank you, thank you. The movement has increased the spread of blood over Lucinnius' clothing. He raises his head. LUCINNIUS You do it now, Hector... hurry... 
HECTOR Lie still... lie still... 
LUCINNIUS Do it Hector... do it... you promised... It looks as if Hector is playing for time. 
HECTOR Shush... I'll need the knife... (CONTINUED)

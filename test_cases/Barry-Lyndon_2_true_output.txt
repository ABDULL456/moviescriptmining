She runs and runs until she is out of breath, and then laughs at the astonishment which keeps Roderick motionless and staring at her. 
After catching her breath, and wiping her forehead, she challenges Roderick to a race. 
RODERICK I accept, but I insist on a wager. The loser must do whatever the winner pleases. 
DOROTHY Agreed. 
RODERICK Do you see the gate at the end of the field?  The first to touch it will be the winner. 
They line up together and start on a count of three. Dorothy uses all her strength, but Roderick holds back, and Dorothy touches the gate five or six paces ahead of him. 
RODERICK (V.O.) I was certain to win, but I meant to lose to see what she would order me to do. 
Dorothy catches her breath, thinking of the penalty.  Then she goes behind the trees and, a few second later, comes out and says: 
DOROTHY Your penalty is to find a cherry- colored ribbon which I have hidden somewhere on my person.  You are free to look for it anywhere you will, and I will think very little of you if you do not find it. 
They sit down on the grass.  Roderick searches her pockets, the fold of her short bodice and her skirt, then her shoes; then he turns up her skirt, slowly and circumspectly, as high as her garters, which she wears upon the knee.  He unfastens them and finds nothing; he draws down her skirt and gropes under her armpits.  The tickling makes her laugh. 
RODERICK I feel the ribbon. 
DOROTHY Then you must get it. 
Roderick has to unlace her bodice and touch her pretty breasts, over which his hand must pass to reach it. 
DOROTHY Why are you shaking? 
RODERICK With pleasure at finding the ribbon. 
EXT.  FIELD - DAY 
Military review.  One hundred English troops, a few mounted officers, a small military band, fifty local people. 
The Dugan family, Roderick and his mother, Captains Best and Grogan. 
Roderick admires the troops in their splendid uniforms. 
RODERICK (V.O.) About this time, the United Kingdom was in a state of great excitement from the threat generally credited of a French invasion.  The noblemen and people of condition in that and all other parts of the kingdom showed their loyalty by raising regiments of horse and foot to resist the invaders.  How I envied them.  The whole country was alive with war's alarums; the three kingdoms ringing with military music, while poor I was obliged to stay at home in my fustian jacket and sigh for fame in secret. 
INT.  BALLROOM AT FENCIBLES - NIGHT 
Dorothy and Roderick entering. 
RODERICK (V.O.) Once, the officers of the Kilwangen regiment gave a grand ball to which Dorothy persuaded my to take her. 
Several cuts depicting the evening. 
Dorothy ignores Roderick; dances, chats, laughs, drinks punch, and finally, strolls outside with Captain Best. 
Roderick makes a half-hearted try at dancing with Miss Clancy. 
RODERICK (V.O.) I have endured torments in my life, but none like that.  Some of the prettiest girls there offered to console me, for I was the best dancer in the room, but I was too wretched, and so remained alone all night in a state of agony.  I did not care for drink, or know the dreadful comfort of it in those days; but I thought of killing myself and Dorothy, and most certainly of making away with Captain Best. 
EXT.  FENCIBLES BALLROOM - DAWN 
The guests leaving and saying their goodbyes. 
RODERICK (V.O.) At last, and at morning, the ball was over. 
EXT.  ROAD - DAWN 
Dorothy and Roderick on horseback together. 
DOROTHY Sure it's a bitter night, Roderick dear, and you'll catch cold without a handkerchief to your neck. 
To this sympathetic remark, from the pillion, the saddle made no reply. 
DOROTHY Did you and Miss Clancy have a pleasant evening, Roderick?  You were together, I saw, all night. 
To this, the saddle only replies by grinding his teeth, and giving a lash to Daisy. 
DOROTHY Oh!  Mercy, you make Daisy rear and throw me, you careless creature, you. 
The pillion had by this got her arm around the saddle's waist, and gave it the gentlest squeeze in the world. 
RODERICK I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do! And I only danced with her because -- because -- the person with whom I intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night.

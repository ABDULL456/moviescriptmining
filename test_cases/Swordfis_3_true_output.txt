Stanley looks up at Ginger, valiantly struggling for her life. 
STANLEY I'm not doing shit until you bring her down. I'm serious. Let her down. Now! 
GABRIEL Okay. 
Gabriel yanks out his .40 cal. H&K, turns and SHOOTS the hanging Ginger. 
STANLEY Nooo... 
Stanley looks at her lifeless body as they lower her. 
He looks up at Gabriel and runs at him. 
Gabriel slaps him in the throat, spinning him, and grabs Stan around the neck in the crook of his arm.

GABRIEL (close and very serious) Take a moment, big guy. Don't make me put you in a wheelchair. 
In the b.g. two mercs zip Ginger's body into a black body bag and carry her out. 
STANLEY You didn't have to kill her. 
GABRIEL I didn't Stan, you did.    But we're not done yet. (to Marco) Marco... 
Marco yanks a seventeen-year-old girl up from the floor and puts a gun to her head. 
GABRIEL There are a lot of hostages here. I cared about Ginger, can you imagine what I could do to someone I don't care about. How long before the money jumps? 
STANLEY Sixty seconds. 
GABRIEL They better hope you installed a back door or it could be a long day. Somebody get me a laptop. 
A laptop appears. Gabriel hands it to Stanley and nods to the mercs who drop him. Stanley drops to his knees, placing the computer on the ground. 
Stanley has logged onto the net via modem and we hear that familiar PULSE as he does. He connects onto an encrypted site on the net. His fingers hum over the keys. 
COMPUTER MERC (looking at a screen) Money just jumped. 
GABRIEL (looking at his watch) Okay, Stan. Sixty seconds.

Sweat rolls down Stanley's face as he works on the machine. Numbers scroll across the screen. Five columns of numbers scroll. 
GABRIEL Forty-five seconds, Stanley. 
STANLEY I need another laptop, logged on! 
He tries to keep from looking up at the crying hostage. The columns decrease. Another laptop appears. 
GABRIEL Twenty seconds, Stan. 
His fingers still fly. Three columns now.         He works on the other laptop with his right hand. 
GABRIEL Fifteen.   She's gonna die, Stanley. 
STANLEY Shut up! 
Two.   Then one. 
STANLEY C'mon, c'mon. 
It scrolls down to one number. 
GABRIEL Ten. 
The home page for Grand Cayman Banc appears on the other laptop. "Account Number" appears. 
GABRIEL Nine... Eight... Seven. 
Stanley has typed in the account number and accesses the account. He flies through the transfer information. Account balance. 6.9 billion dollars. 
STANLEY I need your account number. 
Someone hands him a legal pad.         He types it in. 
GABRIEL Four, three, two...

"Transfer?" -- "Yes" -- TRANSFERRING.

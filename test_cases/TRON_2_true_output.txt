415  EXT. SIMULATION HANGAR                                       415 
As we see Tron and Yori racing through the streets, headed for it. 
416  INT. HANGAR                                                  416 
Tron and Yori enter. Solar Sailer simulation hovers. 
417  A LONG SHOT                                                  417 
As Tron and Yori race across the floor. 
YORI (V.0.) This way...there's a simulation we can use... 
And we see them race towards it. 
418  SHOT OF THEM RISING ON AN ELEVATOR PLATFORM, FROM            419 ABOVE, LOOKING DOWN AT THEM. 
419  A SHOT FROM THE SIDE OF THE SAILER, RISING WITH TRON         419 AND YORI 
We see that this vessel is a simulation of a futuristic spacecraft, designed for travel in the Real world using solar energy, with an enormous metallic sail to catch the rays of sunlight like wind, and move with the speed of light.  The sail is at the bow of the craft, and a long, slender walkway connects it with the deck area, which is made up of several connected flattened box-shapes, giving it the look of a dragonfly. In this world, the Sailer catches data transmission beams instead of sunlight, and is propelled along the information paths to the Central Processing Unit. 
TRON V.O. Can it carry us? 
YORI V.0. The design is good... We don't know why the User abandoned the project... 
The elevator platform brings Tron and Yori through the center, forming part of the deck as it reaches a level position, locked into place. 
420  SHOT OF THEM FROM THE LONG WALKWAY, FACING THE STERN         420 
We see Yori bending over a console of touch panels. 
YORI Yes...it can take us across the Sea of Simulation... all the way out of the Game Grid...to the MCP. 
TRON (looking out of hangar) As long as it gets us out of here 
421  EXT. HANGAR                                                  421 
The crowd of Sark's men are racing towards it. 
CUT TO: 
422  EXT. SOLAR SAILER DECK - TRON AND YORI                       422 
Bending over the console, from the POV of the sail. As we watch, a head leans into the frame from the right. A memory guard. Then we see a hand gripping a staff, and the legs of another guard on the left. 
CUT TO: 
423  THE TWO OF THEM FROM A LOW ANGLE                             423 
On the console, as Yori leans over it. We see that she is looking at a map of the system, a flat grid, and on it, in miniature, are the beam transfer points and transmission location. 
CUT TO: 
424  THE TWO GUARDS, CREEPING DOWN THE WALKWAY                    424 
silently. We can see Tron's back as he hears a noise. His head snaps up; he sees the guards. 
TRON Yori! Get down! 
425  THE GUARDS                                                   425 
Abandoning any attempt at silence, leap forward, shouting, thrusting their staffs at Tron. 
CUT TO: 
426  A LOW ANGLE, AS TRON KICKS THE FIRST GUARD BACK              426 
and slashes the second across the face, knocking him out. 
CUT TO: 
427  EXT. ENTRANCE TO THE HANGAR                                  427 
As Sark's men rush in and head for the stairs to the catwalks that ring the hangar walls. They start swarming up. 
CUT TO: 
428  TRON                                                         428 
reacting, holding his disk ready. 
CUT TO: 
429  OMITTED                                                      429 
430  WALKWAY OF SAILER                                            430 
as guards start swarming on board. We see Tron move forward and then stop, letting them come. 
CUT TO: 
431  YORI'S POV - LONG SHOT                                       431

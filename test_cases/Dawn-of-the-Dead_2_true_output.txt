734	Upstairs, Fran is packing her sack slowly and ponderously. Her face is red from crying. 
735	Peter stands at the stair top looking down at the landing. 
736	Fran sets the sack down at the escape ladder leading to the roof. She deliberately goes to fill another sack. 
737	On the mall balcony, Stephen's corpse walks to the Maintenance corridor. He looks past other wandering Zombies and sees the fake partition. Something in him remembers. He moves forward. 
738	Fran:	IT'S ALMOST LIGHT...LET'S GO. 
Peter looks at her silently from the stairway door. 
Fran:	HE DOESN'T ANSWER THE RADIO...IT'S BEEN HOURS... 
She starts to cry again. 
Fran:	FOR GOD SAKE. YOU BETTER COME ON BECAUSE IF I GET TO THINKIN' ABOUT THIS, I'LL JUST GO ON DOWN THERE AND LET THEM...LET THEM... 
The puppy suddenly growls. It charges between Peter's feet and runs floppily down the steps. 
739	In the hallway, Steve pounds at the fake wall. Other creatures notice and they all move toward the partition. 
740	Upstairs, the pounding can be heard. Peter stands stoically, looking down into the darkness. The dog barks below. 
Fran:	WHAT IS IT? 
Peter:	IT'S STEPHEN...THEY'RE COMIN' UP! 
741	With a great crunching noise the partition gives way from the army of creatures. 
742	Peter slams the door. He speaks quietly. 
Peter:	GO ON...YOU GET OUT OF HERE. 
Fran:	PETER... 
Peter:	I SAID...GET OUT OF HERE. 
From the firestair, we hear the sudden yelping of the puppy as it falls victim to the creatures. The sound echoes through the barren spaces of the storage area. 
Fran:	OH, JESUS, PETER...PLEASE... 
Peter:	I DON'T WANT TO GO...I REALLY DON'T... YOU KNOW THAT? I REALLY DON'T. 
743	Suddenly, the door flies open and the creatures lumber into the living space. Peter stares at them. He smiles slightly. The creatures advance, led by Stephen. 
744	Fran starts to scream. 
Fran:	STEPHEN...STEPHEN... 
She makes a slight move for her lover, but Peter raises his super-gun and shoots the Zombie through the head. 
As Stephen falls, Fran comes up short. The act startles her into awareness. Peter faces her as the creatures come up behind him. 
Peter:	MOVE, WOMAN! 
745	Fran grabs the sacks and climbs the ladder to the roof. 
746	The creatures advance on Peter. He backs away, trying to lead them from the skylight. They crash through the living space, upsetting the carefully planned room. 
747	On the roof, Fran desperately starts the helicopter engine. 
748	Peter backs into the storage room, slamming the door. The creatures approach the door and the super-gun roars one last time. The Zombies push through the door and move in for their feast. 
749	Several zombies manage to scramble up the skylight to the roof. 
Fran stares, transfixed. The blades roar up to full speed. 
The creatures advance toward the machine. 
Fran steps out onto the running board; the creatures very close now. She crouches, watching for a moment, then looks up at the spinning blades. 
She stands straight up, driving her head into the spinning blades. 
A headless form falls to the roof. The Zombies advance. 
750	In a wide shot, silhouetted against the dawn sky, we see the creatures huddled under the chopper blades, feasting on their last victim. 
The credits crawl up. 
Just as the credits end...

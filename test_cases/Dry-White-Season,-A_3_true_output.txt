Ben leans towards Emily. 
BEN I'm sorry, Emily. 
Several press photographers are taking pictures osten- sibly of Emily the widow. Stanley gently guides Emily out of the building. 
Ben, who is following, is besieged by the insistent reporters, shouting: REPORTERS 'Mister Du Toit, how do you know Mrs. Ngubene?' 'Mister Du Toit, can you answer, is it true, he was a terrorist?' Ben tries to get through. REPORTERS Mister Du Toit, what do you think of the verdict? Do you believe the police? Melanie appears, grabs Ben and pushes him away through them. REPORTER Hang on, Melanie, I'm coming with you. MELANIE (shouts back) Fuck off. The press is still pursuing them. 
As Ben and Melanie reach Melanie's car: 
BEN My car is over there. 
MELANIE (opening the car) Never mind your car. Let's get away from these vultures. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: They get into the car and as they drive away, Melanie introduces herself. 
MELANIE By the way, I'm Melanie Bruwer. 
BEN Obviously of the Rand Daily Mail. I read your article about Jonathan. 
MELANIE Ten out of ten, Mr. Du Toit.      I know about you too. 
BEN (uncomfortable) You do? Melanie smiles. MELANIE We have a mutual friend.    One Stanley. BEN I remember. The mortuary in Soweto... (pause) ... The ambiguous Stanley. MELANIE Stanley? No. Just careful. A big black rough uncut diamond. Don't be fooled by his happy-go- lucky attitude. There's much more to him. 
BEN He couldn't have given you a glowing report of me. (suddenly aggressive) I'm sorry, but where are we going? MELANIE I thought a cooling drink at my house. BEN (on the defensive) Mrs. Bruwer, I'm not... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: MELANIE (interrupts) I promise you. I'm not after an interview or anything like that. She smiles. 
BEN I really must go home. MELANIE Please, Mr. Du Toit, and you'll meet my darling father. She smiles again.    A disarming smile. 
EXT. MELANIE'S HOME - DAY Melanie drives into the yard. The house is an old Colonial style house amidst flowers, bushes and trees, a controlled wild garden. A figure is bent over a beehive. A large brimmed old hat with a net hides his head and features. Melanie stops the car in the driveway. MELANIE (pointing from the car) There he is by the eucalyptus tree, on the left. That's old Bruwer. 
They get out of the car and walk towards him. BEN How long have you lived here? MELANIE Oh, about twenty-one years.   I love this house. BRUWER (without looking up) Is that you, Melanie? 
MELANIE Of course, Dad. I want you to meet a friend. 
BRUWER Does anyone have a friend nowadays? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: He straightens up and throws the net over his head and studies Ben. MR. BRUWER is seventy years old; an interesting face with a goatee beard. MELANIE Mr. Du toit, Dad. 
BRUWER Do you like bees? BEN (smiling) I have nothing against them. MELANIE (to Ben) Be careful, I can see philosophy coming. BRUWER You shut up. (to Ben) Let me tell you about bees, and for that matter ants: a bee has a completely altruistic sense of purpose -- based on the common good. A course from which he cannot be deflected. Greed, ambition, they mean nothing to him. He lives solely to serve his fellow bee. MELANIE What about individuality, Dad? BRUWER There's the rub, my girl. There's the rub. One of these days I'll ask the bees. I'm sure they have the answer. Now, you two run along! 
He replaces his net and continues with the hive. MELANIE A drink, Dad? 
BRUWER I've been peeing too much this morning. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: MELANIE (as they walk toward the house) That's my Daddy. Melanie and Ben enter the house. 
INT. MELANIE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY The Bruwer living room is a profusion of piles of papers, of books on shelves, on tables, on the floor, paintings -- records, African sculptures. On the floor tangled lengths of flex leading from a record player to two voluminous speakers. 
A settee, a chess set. The furniture is old and well- used, dominated by a large leather club chair -- two big cats sleeping on it. It's civilized pandemonium. MELANIE (gesturing to the room) Now you see in what environment I was spawned. Ben looks at the shelves and smiles. MELANIE Please sit down, on that chair. (pointing to club chair) That's Dad's. Drink?

{"test1_input": "\"I'LL DO ANYTHING\" \nScreenplay by \nJames L. Brooks \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nFADE IN: \nINT. PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT \nThe CAMERA briskly retreats as FORTY, HIGHLY CHARGED, ATTRACTIVE, YOUNG PEOPLE march towards it. Each side of the frame is black as this troupe of young actors moves up the middle, everyone talking, grinning, squealing,... everyone having the \"high\" of their lives. \nINT. NEW YORK CLUB - NIGHT \nAs the troupe, with geometric precision, spills into a large room (containing a raised dance floor); the CAMERA begins to move past dancing couples as a legend appears: \n'This is 1975 and Matt Hobbs is singled out for the first time.' \nAnd now the CAMERA reveals MATT HOBBS. His open, friendly, American face slips between some of the many cracks in his profession. The face at 26, and forever more, not arresting enough for a leading man; not quirky enough for a \"character.\" Matt must briefly walk on the dance floor to make his way past a knot of people. He dances furiously for two seconds, then steps down as THE DANCERS BEGIN TO SING \"WOW\", but just as the song breaks out musically, we hear the SOUND OF PEOPLE SHHHING; the singers falter and then stop as the party-goers gather, in choreographed movement, at a ceiling mounted TV set. \nMAN ON TV \nWe can barely discern the words. . .\"with his review is Leonard Graff.\" \nA FRANTIC ACTRESS yelps a command: \nFRANTIC ACTRESS I can't hear over this shhing. \nSilence, then: \nTV CRITIC ...a play about guess what? That's right, young people. \nON MATT \nHe stands next to a ruggedly handsome and extremely nauseous CONTEMPORARY. \nHANDSOME CONTEMPORARY I can't look. \nMATT Good idea, let's not. \nHe begins to walk, the Handsome Contemporary falling into step. Everyone they pass is straining, upwards, at the TV. \nHANDSOME CONTEMPORARY How can we not listen to this? \nMATT We'll know all we need to from the reaction. \nAt that moment, the rest of the party-goers turn from the TV as one, looking mugged. (One girl briefly gets our attention because she is particularly distraught; tears streaming down her angry face. The mixture of tears and rage are, of course, the chemical components of incredible sexiness. Her name is BETH.) A TORTURED MALE DANCER offers an incantation. \nTORTURED MALE DANCER He should be shot, he should be dead, he should rot in hell, then come back as the soap cake in a urinal. \nHANDSOME CONTEMPORARY (to dancer) He didn't like it? \nThe DIRECTOR moves through the group, bucking up spirits. \nDIRECTOR Don't worry. He doesn't count. We'll just wait for the papers. \nON MATT AND FELLOW CAST MEMBERS - LATER \nAs they morosely watch the Director approach. \nMATT Hey, no matter what this review says, the play was a great experience for me. \nBeth looks at him, puzzled. \nMATT (again) I mean, it is about process, right? \nHANDSOME CONTEMPORARY Matt's right. Good Lord, it is what we're alive for. \nBeth turns from the conversation, finding it preposterous, then rivets her attention on the Director, walking towards them, holding a ridiculously thick sheaf of papers. Beth begins to sob in anticipation. \nMATT You've just got to be tougher than this. \nBETH (incredulous) Tougher than this?!? \nThe Director reaches them. \nDIRECTOR I took it all down over the phone. It's quite bad. And, unfortunately, it's very, very long. I've got a broken heart and writers' cramp. He... \nMATT He's nuts. \nDIRECTOR He savages everyone. \n", "test1_true": "DIRECTOR Except you, Matt. \nThey all look at him. \nHANDSOME CONTEMPORARY (fiercely to Matt) You filthy bastard. \nBETH (drawing closer to Matt) What did he say? \nThe Director hunts for the paragraph. \nMATT Don't read it. \nOTHER ACTOR Oh, please. You can't wait to run out of here, buy a flashlight, and then go into some dark alley and drool over every word. \nMATT (truthfully) You're wrong. I'm maybe relieved and curious. That's it. \nBETH (wildly exasperated) What did they say about him? \nDIRECTOR (reading) ...'in the midst of this delirium of pretension...' \nMATT Don't. This divisive crap won't... \nDIRECTOR (again) '...one actor, rather miraculously, manages to provide passion and, yes, truth. Matt Hobbs, in the supporting role of Jesus, manages to touch the heart long after you thought it numbed by boredom.' \nThe table of actors look at a sober Matt. A long beat and then, against his will, he grins... then a short, involuntary barking laugh of joy... then: \nMATT (to his colleagues with sincerity) Sorry. \nMORPH TO: \nESTABLISHING SHOT - L.A. MODERATE INCOME STREET \nAs we HEAR the next lines of \"WOW\", BEGIN MAIN TITLES as the CAMERA BOOMS UP to the outside of a small apartment as a legend appears on screen: \n'EMMY NIGHT - 1980' \nBeth, now 27, is standing in front of a TV set showing the Emmy dancers performing a phrase of \"WOW\". She screams out. \nBETH Will you get in here--for God's sake? \nINT. ANOTHER ROOM \nMatt, 30, is on the phone. \nMATT (into phone) Come on, Ma, how could I show up tonight when my union is boycotting the Emmys? Look, I have to hang up. \nBETH (O. S.) (screaming voice) It's on right now... right now... right this second! You will miss it!! \nMATT (into phone) I gotta go. Watch! \nMatt hangs up and tear-asses into the living room. Beth screams as his name is read. \nTV VOICE (on TV) ...and Matt Hobbs for 'Caine Mutiny Court Martial'... And the winner is Powers Boothe for 'Jonestown--Story of a Massacre.' \nBETH Shit! Fuck! Shit! \nMATT He was good. \nBETH (again) Shit! Shit! Shit! Fuck! Shit! Look, he even showed up. \nTV INSERT - POWERS BOOTHE ACCEPTANCE SPEECH \nMATT That took courage. I wonder if they send you something for just being nominated? \nBETH Of all the pathetic questions. \nMATT (sharply) Why are you being so damn foul? \nBeth glares at him, on the verge of taking him on--but he is looking at her very directly... the lack of any other agenda giving him a temporary edge... Beth decides to state the unadorned truth. \nBETH We've been going back and forth on our status for so long. I was hoping that if you won, it might mean something for us. \nMATT Look, Beth... the only... \nShe is waving her hand in a circle... he is puzzled. \nBETH Please go fast. I can't take you dragging it out. \nMATT (a bit faster) The only reason I haven't... \nBETH I promised myself I wouldn't be so bossy. Take your time!! Was that bossy too? \nMATT (persisting) The only thing I have against getting married is that it might not be fair because I'm going to stay with acting forever and you know how erratic the money's been and there's no resolve... \n", "test1_id": 2331, "test2_input": "JEANNIE You don't make sense. I don't understand you. \nMATT I think you do. \nJeannie reacts broadly... indicating what a difficult man she's stuck with. \nMATT Just know that... \nJEANNIE Okayyyy! \nMATT (giving up) You want to help me make a phone call? \nShe goes quickly to the phone and picks it up. \nMATT Seven... two... \nJEANNIE (hitting numbers) Who are we calling? \nMATT Cathy. She's very nice. One... six... \nJEANNIE (hard to read) \"Very nice...\" One... \nINT. CATHY'S HOUSE - DAY \nAs she answers phone. \nJEANNIE'S VOICE Hi... (to Matt) What now? \nMATT'S VOICE IN BACKGROUND \nTell her, 'How are you' and then let me... \nJEANNIE'S VOICE How are you? \nCATHY Jeannie... I can't talk now because... \nJEANNIE Wait, my dad wants to... \nCATHY Tell him I can't talk 'cause I'm on the phone with a director... \nJEANNIE He wants to talk to you very much and... \nCATHY (sharply) I can't. I have to hang up. \nShe does. \nINT. MATT'S APT. - NIGHT \nJeannie, truly stung by the hang-up. She takes this act of Cathy's as an insult to herself and her father. Matt doesn't feel too wonderful about it himself. \nMATT You have to understand that sometimes people are too busy. \nJEANNIE So she's too busy for you? \nINT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nBurke and Nan eating together on an elevated balcony overlooking the main eating area. \nBURKE We look like jerks eating here this early. Everybody's going to think we couldn't get a reservation for the hot hours. \nNAN Why do you do this to yourself? Why do you insist on eating dinner in a restaurant where you're bound to see all the people you're afraid of? \nBURKE I'm not afraid of them. \nNAN What do you call it when you think that what a group of people think of you can confirm or destroy any decent idea you have of yourself? \nBURKE Normal. \nNAN How did little Jeannie do today? \nBURKE Isn't it something that they have you testing the TV show? \nNAN What I asked was, how did Jeannie do? \nBURKE What are you talking about? \nNAN Somebody else. Jeannie. How did she do? \nBURKE Don't talk to me like this. \nNAN (really pissed) I want to be treated as if I'm really saying words to you which you engage and respond to. I like Matt; I'd like to know how his daughter did. So before you take your dance of desperation across the restaurant and I end up feeling so sorry for you that I could die, I would like you to answer my question. \nBURKE She did okay... and don't worry about Matt... If the pilot sells, his kid will be making five thousand a week. So what do you know about 'People Get Hurt?' \n", "test2_true": "BURKE I knew. I knew. What the hell are you smiling for? \nNAN Forgive me. But telling you about this latest failure of yours--it pleases me. I have no idea why. \nBURKE I can't be with someone who's not rooting for me. \nNAN I think I am. It's just that rooting for you is a good deal more complicated than you realize. (as he rises) Don't go. \nBURKE Don't worry. I'm not that mad. I gotta do this. \nMUSIC IN as Burke leaves the table. This \"Dance of Desperation\" is classical. Burke himself lifting one of the women in greeting, then, as he puts her down. \nBURKE (again) Sorry. I thought you were someone else. \nAs he continues to go from table to table. \nTIGHT ON NAN \nAs she looks down on him, dying for him, we HEAR her sing the song \"Poor Bastards\". Finally, not only about Burke--but the other damaged souls he seeks to dance with. Now, Nan can take no more. She exits. \nFULL SHOT - BURKE \nAs he sees her go past in the background, he goes after her, finally grabbing her near the Maitre D' station. This, just as TWO IMPORTANT COUPLES arrive. Burke frantically tries to cover. \nBURKE Nan, you know Victor and his wife... (he mumbles, unable to remember any wife's name) and Jay and his wife... (he mumbles) \nNAN Yes. I'm sorry I can't talk now. I'm very upset about what's happening to Burke, so I just made up my mind I can't be witness to it anymore if I love him and I certainly shouldn't be here if I don't... so I was just in the process of leaving when he stopped me and you folks walked in... I'm sure you've had something like this happen to you some time... some horrible thing in your personal life happening in public. \nThey all nod and ad-lib agreements with her premise to Burke's amazement. \nNAN (again) Thank you for understanding. (to Burke) Goodbye. I wish only good things for you even though I feel I've been really damaged by this relationship. \nShe exits, enormously upset. Burke, torn between following her and repairing the social damage. But the couples are paying him no mind; rather they are impressed with Nan. As they comment, i.e. \nCOUPLES Wasn't that spectacular? I've never seen anybody that secure... \nBurke accepts the compliments as if meant for him. \nBURKE Thank you. Thank you. We're very close. \nEXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nThe strains of \"Poor Bastards\" underscoring the moment as Burke rushes into the parking area and grabs Nan's hand just as a valet brings her car. \nNAN You don't understand that I'm exhausted from hurting. I'm through with you. \nShe begins to cry. Ordinarily this would be a scene which would be unendurable for Burke. However, the lesson of a moment ago is not lost on him. As people get out of cars and witness the sobbing Nan. \nBURKE (to restaurant patrons) Excuse me, we're working our shit out... I'm sure it happened to you... you know, private stuff in public. \nThe reaction to his openness is disdain and passing contempt. She drives off, leaving Burke hurt and alone. \"Poor Bastards\" up and out. \nINT. MATT'S APT. - NIGHT \nThe lighting soft and sweet. Jeannie's words are tentative as she talks to her father who sits watching intently. \nJEANNIE I don't know if I've been bad. I know somebody's been bad. (hopefully) ...maybe it's you. \nMatt laughs. Jeannie looks at him shyly... he looks at her with encouragement. Suddenly she is in his arms, hugging him hard, an emotional dam seems to have broken. \nJEANNIE Oh, I love you so much, I love you so much... I love you so much. \nMatt holds on--clearly, deeply moved. Then he exercises the effort to control his emotions and speaks, surprisingly, as a Black woman. \nMATT (as Black woman) I hope that makes you feel a whole lot better, Chile... 'Cause it sure goes a long way to cure what ails me. \nJEANNIE I can't believe I... \nMATT (as himself, coaching) ...got in this much... \nJEANNIE ...got in this much trouble. . \nMATT Right. Over a... \nJEANNIE (guessing) Word? \nMATT Yes. 'I can't believe I got in this much trouble over a word.' Now do you know what she means when she says that? \nJEANNIE I don't want to talk about it--just say her stuff so I know mine. \nMATT No. \nShe starts to flail a bit. \n", "test2_id": 2332, "test3_input": "CATHY I'll talk fast. It's amazing news. Oliver Stone's been looking for a comedy and... \nMATT (distracted) I've got to see my kid. \nCATHY (her voice breaking) ...he's doing my picture. \nMATT Hey. Good. \nHe starts off. \nCATHY Part of this involves you. He remembers you from 'Platoon' and wants to use you in this one. (he stops) Got your attention, huh? \nMatt is terminally disappointed in her last cynical sentence. \nMATT Oh, Cathy. Look, I'm going to watch this. Let me talk to you later or tomorrow. Thanks for your help. It's good news. Gotta go. \nFrom the stage, we HEAR the VOICE of the WARM-UP MAN. \nWARM-UP MAN'S VOICE First, in her first appearance ever, Jeannie Hobbs... \nThere is applause. Matt's missed her intro. \nMATT Shit. \nCATHY I'm sorry. \nMATT Why couldn't you wait till later? Shit. \nCATHY (broadly) I guess it's because I'm just incredibly insensitive to all human needs. I'd ask you to save me, but I'm so far gone, I wouldn't want you to waste your time. \nMATT (after a moment) Huh? \nShe reacts, but he walks off, not wanting to get into it. Cathy, however, has had a tricky nerve struck. She continues, biting off each word. \nCATHY You know, I don't have a kid or a mate or a talent. (holding up book bag) I got this. (she's quite upset) And shoot me if I think it's important. \nMATT'S POV \nCathy, who looks alone and adorable as we HEAR MUSIC of \"THIS LONELY LIFE OF MINE.\" He puts a comforting hand on her. She speaks nakedly from deep within herself; her eyes downcast. \nCATHY You think I'm a superficial jerk. (and then a whispered afterthought) You can't be right. \nMATT I think you're the best of the bunch. \nCATHY (broadly) Oh, great. \nAnd now she raises her eyes--big, blue and vulnerable. If this look were returned, \"I love yous\" could flow--they could sink to the floor in a joint epiphany; but there is no romance or kindling in Matt's eyes. He is in a hurry. Pridefully, Cathy turns and walks off in the opposite direction, her flight so instinctive, she forgets her book bag. We hold on this--her exit, then: \nINT. STUDIO FLOOR - BURKE AND MATT - 20 MINUTES LATER \nStanding just behind the four television cameras, immediately behind them, the \"rail\" where the Show's Staff and Crew Members and Network Bosses stand crowded, choreographed in the way in which they \"clear\" for a moving camera. Behind these people is the studio audience. There is a loud laugh. Burke turns around to study the audience. \nBURKE'S POV \nHappy faces accompanied by the strains of Burke's love song to the crowd... \nBURKE (to Matt) What do you think? \nBut Matt doesn't hear him... a few feet away, Jeannie is making ready for her big moment. Three cameras swing in front of them, TV monitors showing a MASTER and CLOSE-UPS of the three characters in the scene: a short comic WHITE MAN, the Black Female Lead, and Jeannie, dressed as a poor child. \nMATT (wide-eyed) Wait. This is it. \nANGLE - STAGE \nJEANNIE It's like everyone is pi... ticked off at me because I'm not colored. \nThe White Man jumps on the phrase. \nSHORT WHITE MAN (correcting her pompously) The word is black. \nBLACK LEAD ACTRESS (correcting him with booming voice) The word is African American. \nA burst of laughter, whooping and applause from the audience. Burke brags in a whisper to Matt. \nBURKE I had them bring in two busloads of people from black churches. \nANGLE - STAGE \nAs they play out the scene. \nBLACK LEAD ACTRESS (scolding Jeannie) Now you use it in a sentence. \nJEANNIE Look at me, I... \n", "test3_true": "And Jeannie begins to falter... she must somehow cry at this moment... She looks outward for help. \nJEANNIE'S POV \nShe looks at the Lead Actress giving Jeannie all she can. \nBACK TO JEANNIE \nJeannie still can't cry. She looks past the cameras. \nJEANNIE'S POV \nHer father nervously pulling for her. \nBACK TO JEANNIE \nThat didn't do it either. She looks into herself... she blinks-- there are tears running down her cheek. \nWHOLE AUDIENCE Awwwww. \nGROUP SHOT \nMatt, very much as he was when he watched Brando on the plane... and then some. Burke, craning to make sure the network bosses are suitably transported. \nBACK TO JEANNIE'S SCENE \nBLACK LEAD ACTRESS Go ahead. Use it in a sentence. \nJEANNIE (crying fully) Look at me. I love an African American. \nBLACK LEAD ACTRESS Look at me. I love a little redneck. \nThe Black Lead Actress holds out her arms to Jeannie, who, tears streaming down her face, runs towards the arms... \nON BURKE \nHis lips pursed tightly in pleasure, then agape in shock. \nBURKE'S POV \nJeannie has run past the Lead Actress and off the set, going into her father's arms instead. She jumps on him, her legs and arms wrapped around him. \nMATT AND JEANNIE \nMATT (pridefully) You little stinker! \nJEANNIE You big stinker. \nMATT My little stinker. \nJEANNIE My big stinker. \nThe background to this intimacy is enormously alive. The Lead Actress and the Character Actor laughing out loud. In the b.g., we see the audience filling out preview cards as the FLOOR MANAGER leans in to say: \nFLOOR MANAGER It's okay, Jeannie. Take a minute. We just need to get that hug at the end. \nMATT (to Floor Manager) Amazing, right? \nFLOOR MANAGER (to Jeannie) You were great. \nJEANNIE Thank you. That's nice. \nMATT You look happy. \nJEANNIE I loved it, Daddy. \nMatt starts to walk her back to the set. \nMATT You want me to put you down? \nHer answer surprises him. \nJEANNIE No. This is okay. \nMATT Okay... Now, you're not finished until you hug the lady just like you did me. \nHe puts her down. She turns from him to go back to work but, on impulse, he restrains her. He is kneeling down, holding her lightly by the arms, her back to him as he states an ultimate truth: \nMATT I'm very proud of you. I love you more than anybody. \nJeannie, shocked by her father's unprecedented sentiment, turns to face him and clamp a hand over his mouth so he will add no more lush and primal affection. Having silenced him though, she finds that she has something of her own to say. She'd never tell it to her father, but she can't resist telling it to her acting coach. \nJEANNIE When I had to cry, I thought of you buried in the ground. \n", "test3_id": 2333}

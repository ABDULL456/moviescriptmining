{"train": "\"I'LL DO ANYTHING\" \nScreenplay by \nJames L. Brooks \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nFADE IN: \nINT. PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT \nThe CAMERA briskly retreats as FORTY, HIGHLY CHARGED, ATTRACTIVE, YOUNG PEOPLE march towards it. Each side of the frame is black as this troupe of young actors moves up the middle, everyone talking, grinning, squealing,... everyone having the \"high\" of their lives. \nINT. NEW YORK CLUB - NIGHT \nAs the troupe, with geometric precision, spills into a large room (containing a raised dance floor); the CAMERA begins to move past dancing couples as a legend appears: \n'This is 1975 and Matt Hobbs is singled out for the first time.' \nAnd now the CAMERA reveals MATT HOBBS. His open, friendly, American face slips between some of the many cracks in his profession. The face at 26, and forever more, not arresting enough for a leading man; not quirky enough for a \"character.\" Matt must briefly walk on the dance floor to make his way past a knot of people. He dances furiously for two seconds, then steps down as THE DANCERS BEGIN TO SING \"WOW\", but just as the song breaks out musically, we hear the SOUND OF PEOPLE SHHHING; the singers falter and then stop as the party-goers gather, in choreographed movement, at a ceiling mounted TV set. \nMAN ON TV \nWe can barely discern the words. . .\"with his review is Leonard Graff.\" \nA FRANTIC ACTRESS yelps a command: \nFRANTIC ACTRESS I can't hear over this shhing. \nSilence, then: \nTV CRITIC ...a play about guess what? That's right, young people. \nON MATT \nHe stands next to a ruggedly handsome and extremely nauseous CONTEMPORARY. \nHANDSOME CONTEMPORARY I can't look. \nMATT Good idea, let's not. \nHe begins to walk, the Handsome Contemporary falling into step. Everyone they pass is straining, upwards, at the TV. \nHANDSOME CONTEMPORARY How can we not listen to this? \nMATT We'll know all we need to from the reaction. \nAt that moment, the rest of the party-goers turn from the TV as one, looking mugged. (One girl briefly gets our attention because she is particularly distraught; tears streaming down her angry face. The mixture of tears and rage are, of course, the chemical components of incredible sexiness. Her name is BETH.) A TORTURED MALE DANCER offers an incantation. \nTORTURED MALE DANCER He should be shot, he should be dead, he should rot in hell, then come back as the soap cake in a urinal. \nHANDSOME CONTEMPORARY (to dancer) He didn't like it? \nThe DIRECTOR moves through the group, bucking up spirits. \nDIRECTOR Don't worry. He doesn't count. We'll just wait for the papers. \nON MATT AND FELLOW CAST MEMBERS - LATER \nAs they morosely watch the Director approach. \nMATT Hey, no matter what this review says, the play was a great experience for me. \nBeth looks at him, puzzled. \nMATT (again) I mean, it is about process, right? \nHANDSOME CONTEMPORARY Matt's right. Good Lord, it is what we're alive for. \nBeth turns from the conversation, finding it preposterous, then rivets her attention on the Director, walking towards them, holding a ridiculously thick sheaf of papers. Beth begins to sob in anticipation. \nMATT You've just got to be tougher than this. \nBETH (incredulous) Tougher than this?!? \nThe Director reaches them. \nDIRECTOR I took it all down over the phone. It's quite bad. And, unfortunately, it's very, very long. I've got a broken heart and writers' cramp. He... \nMATT He's nuts. \nDIRECTOR He savages everyone. \nCLAIRE (fiercely) Matt Hobbs? Matt Hobbs! \nON MATT \nGoing over his lines. Hearing his name, he rises. Claire gestures him in. \nINT. BURKE'S OFFICE - DAY \nThe walls are pockmarked with movie posters. THREE MEN sit in an area some distance from the desk. The casting director, MARTIN, makes the introduction: \nMARTIN This is Matt Hobbs... This is John Earl McAlpine, the director. \nMCALPINE Good to see you. \nHe speaks with an Australian accent, gets half-up and extends his hand. \nMARTIN ...and Burke Adler, the producer. \nBURKE So, what have you been doing with yourself... (checking resume) ...the last few years? \nMATT (to Burke) I'm real bad at interviews, so, if you don't mind, I'd really prefer to just read first. \nBURKE That's the way you want to do it? \nMATT Yes. \nBURKE Maybe we shouldn't even read. I'll just take your word that you're good. \nMatt smiles. \nBURKE No. I'm serious. There's all different ways. Did you know Woody Allen never reads actors? He just looks at them, feels around a little and then decides who he wants. That's his way. Doesn't hear them do a line. I also have a way. What I do is interview first-- then read--maybe do it all over again the next day. I call up people the actor has worked with--check him out. If he's famous, I do an opinion survey to test how much people like him. If he's not famous, I put him on tape and show it to everyone I can grab. I believe in screen tests; I believe in replacing if the dailies are bad, in cutting people out if the previews aren't there. Because I'm not doing movies for theaters where they serve cappucino in the lobby. I'm doing popcorn movies. You want to know what I like? Come to my house, look at my lamps... you won't find it in my movies. In my movies, you'll find out what I know. I know how to do detail. What I don't know, I discover. Yesterday we finished mixing a movie--the last scene is in a field of windmills which blows up and all the blades of these windmills slice through the air, one of which hits a four-story tank of propane gas. A humongous explosion scene. I kept on saying 'louder', and they finally said to me they couldn't go louder without distortion. We went louder. We had to discover a thing, a filter, but we went louder. I don't question doing these things. I do them. So if you want to know if it's okay to do it differently--not to talk--to just read first... I say... (pointing to John Earl) Ask him--he's the director. \nJOHN EARL Whatever. \nBURKE Okay, let's do it. Do you have any questions? \nMATT They only gave me these two pages. I'd like to give this my best shot. So if I could read the script and come back... \nBURKE This part works tomorrow. \nMATT Oh. Who will I be reading with? \nBurke indicates Martin. \nMATT (from his chair) Can I read from here? \nBURKE I want you to do it wherever you're comfortable, but I'd prefer it if you were comfortable standing up. \nMatt rises uncomfortably. A SECRETARY enters and hands a note to the director. \nJOHN EARL Time for my buns to have visitors. \nMatt looks astonished as the director leaves the room. \nBURKE (to Matt) Go ahead. \nMATT Go ahead? The director left. \nBURKE That's okay, he trusts me, uh... And we're just doing the first page. \nMARTIN (cueing him badly) 'Okay, darling Harry, here it is... If someone were breaking up with me, I'd like it short and sweet. What about you?' \nMATT (reading--showing pain) 'Incredibly drawn out...' \nMARTIN 'I can't take care of you right now. What am I, your mother?' \nMATT (intense) 'Well, what am I? Your duck?' \nAs he gets into the scene he begins to experience some release of the desperate feelings he's been harboring. \nMATT (again) 'We've been together two years and you act like all you're doing is blowing away some feathers. So what I'm asking...' \nBURKE You didn't do the quack. \nMATT Huh? \nBURKE The stage direction says for him to quack. \nMATT I know, but why would he quack when someone's breaking up with him? \nBURKE Hopefully because it's funny. \nMATT This isn't a comedy. \nMALE D PERSON Who is he? \nCATHY Oh, I was auditing this acting course and he filled in teaching one night. He did a scene himself and he was awesome. For some reason, he can't get arrested. \nMALE D PERSON Yeah. He does seem to have a layer of loser dust on him. \nEXT. PARKING LOT - DAY \nMatt drives his faded, seven-year-old car into view. \nINT./EXT. MATT'S CAR - EARLY EVENING \nHe looks off... sees something that arrests his interest and pulls to the curb. It's a curious sight. \nMATT'S POV \nBurke Adler, standing at a street corner, palpably in pain. He's trying to rein in his emotions, sucking in huge gulps of air... and, then, a wave of emotion gets the better of him as he looks at his watch. A sob escapes him--shocked that he's so close to tears on a public street corner, he battles for control... another sob as he looks to the heavens. \nON MATT \nA split second to consider, then he's out of his car. \nFULL SHOT - THE STREET CORNER \nA flow of PEOPLE--in the foreground, the tortured figure of Burke Adler--in the background, Matt Hobbs, pauses before intruding. But Burke's spectacle is growing more public, sounds of anguish escape him. \nCLOSER SHOT - BURKE \nBURKE Oh, God... why? Why?... (louder) What am I going to do? \nAnd now he begins to dissassemble, openly crying--on the verge of a complete breakdown. Matt moves into frame, grabbing Burke, trying to provide him with an anchor. \nCLOSE ON MATT \nHis face--his eyes providing a beacon of strength. \nMATT Hey. Hey! HEY!! \nON BURKE \nTotally fucked-up, wild-eyed. As he witnesses his own state. \nBURKE Look at me. You'd think I was a writer. (his story of travail pours from him) I hired this kid as a production assistant. His father's a business manager... a few good clients. \nMATT What happened? \nBURKE He's been driving for me two weeks... all he has to do is pick me up on time... he's twenty minutes late and I have a test screening in the valley. Everybody's gone from the office. \nBurke flails at himself as Matt looks at him. \nMATT Is that it? You need a lift? \nBURKE Yeah. \nMATT I'm right over here. \nMatt starts to lead him back, then realizes he's alone, Burke having seen his car finally arrive. \nMATT'S POV \nBurke, berating the YOUNG DRIVER. Matt pauses, awed by the wild gesticulating--the few screamed words... \nBURKE (O.S.) ...Not just today... believe me, there's no way you'll ever make it... You are going to fail. Listen, listen-- I know about this; you are going to be a failure. \nCAMERA FOLLOWING MATT \nAs he joins Burke and the young man, Burke turns to Matt. \nBURKE (to Matt) Let's get moving; you said you'd give me a lift. \nMATT What the hell are you talking about? Not in your car... I've got my own. \nBURKE I'll give you a hundred and twenty dollars to take me... and it will still be a favor. (to Young Man) Get out. Come on. (to Matt) Please. This is very important. \nThe driver gets out. \nYOUNG MAN (final plea) A guy got shot on the freeway... Traffic's tied up. \nBURKE You should leave time for that kind of thing. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BURKE'S CAR \nBURKE I'm glad you came yourself instead of sending your staff. \nThe boss is startled--jumps. BURKE eyes him... there must be some way to profit from these stolen moments with a powerful man. \nBURKE I wouldn't be surprised if tonight's screening is a monster. (emphatically) Could happen, right? \nSTUDIO HEAD Sure. \nBURKE Okay. \nHe moves back to Matt and Nan at the rear of the audience. \nBURKE (to Matt) Eisner just said he thinks the screening will be a monster. \nStrangely, Burke seems truly buoyed by the words of encouragement he himself manufactured. He moves down three rows and sits in an aisle seat just as the film opens with a series of violent explosions. \nCLOSE ON NAN \nNAN Please, God, let tonight give him peace. \nIncredibly, Burke turns and gestures to her that the sound of her small voice is interfering with the cacophony of his movie. Nan is clearly stricken by her lapse as she whispers to Matt. \nNAN We're short two card-counters, can you two help out? \nINT. MOVIE THEATER - 1:47:20 LATER \nWe are seeing one of the final moments of the film. \nINT. WHOLESALE BUTCHER'S (THE FILM) - DAY \nAs the muscular hero moves with stealth through the giant refrigerated meat door. He passes cows and dead men hanging from alternate hooks. Suddenly, he is attacked by the villain brandishing an electric meat dismembering tool. The hero ducks, the machine ripping apart hanging cow flesh. The hero grabs the only weapon he can find: a large piece of meat on a large bone, which he uses as a mace. He clubs the other man--then again--and again. Part of the audience is whooping and applauding. \nQUICK SHOT OF NAN \nStanding with Matt and Cathy. At the sound of the applause, Nan grins and mumbles with a connoisseur's knowledge. \nNAN Males, fifteen and under. \nBACK TO SCREEN \nWhere the hero stands over the man whose face he has shattered, holding a club from which hang strings of meat. He is breathing heavily, and between breaths, states: \nHERO Sorry to bust your chops. \nGeneral audience laughter. \nSERIES OF SHOTS ON NAN - FRONT OF AUDIENCE \nNAN If you'll just stay in your seats a few moments and fill out these cards for us... \nON AISLES \nMatt and others handing out cards with pencils attached... Folks filling them out. As an ADOLESCENT MALE fills it out; PREVIEW CARD FILLS THE SCREEN as we view LIVE ACTION THROUGH IT. \nINT. THEATER MANAGER'S OFFICE \nAn office meant for two, containing twenty counters. The counting is done with erasers rifling stacks, creating a sound, a MUSICAL RHYTHM, as the GROUP CAPTAIN calls out with gospel cadence. \nGROUP CAPTAIN Who has young males? Young women? Older males?... Older males?... \nMatt, his tally finished, squats on the floor, waiting. The Group Captain approaches. \nGROUP CAPTAIN Older males... older males? \nMatt looks blank. \nGROUP CAPTAIN (again) Older males... over 25? \nMatt now realizes that it is his category and hands over the older male cards and exits. \nINT. THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT \nBurke, prowling the lobby as audience stragglers leave and Studio Execs and Popcorn Development Staff wait. He looks off to see Matt and Nan chatting in another part of the lobby. \nON MATT AND NAN \nAs they arrive... Nan looks off to see the Group Captain approach. \nNAN How long since you've seen your daughter? \nMATT A little over two years. (on her look) My wife insisted on moving back to the Midwest--then I was in the Philippines on the mini-series and... \nNAN (suddenly and loudly) Oh, please. It's one thing being a son-of-a-bitch, but you don't have to be a stupid son-of-a-bitch. People move heaven and earth to see their kids. I don't care if she moved to Pluto, it's abandonment. \nNAN The definite recommends are way off for a score this high and, even for action-adventure, it's just too low for women. (Burke looks anguished) I'm sorry. \nHe leans against the car for support. \nBURKE It was such a good score. \nNAN (extraordinarily sympathetic) I know... And, unfortunately, yesterday's tracking wasn't... (he reacts) I'm sorry... They just don't seem in the mood for action-adventure right... (he reacts) Sorry... May I tell you one more thing? (he looks up in anticipatory fear) I think it's so wonderful that you don't worry about even trying to act strong. \nBURKE Thanks. You want to eat something sometime? \nNAN I'm, uh... I'm blushing from head to foot. \nBURKE Good. I'll call you. \nAs Burke moves to his car. He SEES the Group Captain paying Matt. \nGROUP CAPTAIN Thirty-two, thirty-three. \nBurke is looking at Matt with some surprise. \nBURKE You want to do this regularly for me? I was gonna offer, but I thought it would humiliate you. \nMATT (straight at him) I don't mind an occasional odd job. But I can't work tomorrow. I have to get my kid. \nAs they get in the car, Burke has the front door open, about to get in--reconsiders, and gets in the rear door. \nBURKE Okay, I got the cards to look at--I think I'll ride back here. (to Nan) Maybe I'll drop by your place tomorrow. \nMatt gets behind the wheel, thereby ending the day as a full- fledged chauffeur. They drive off. \nEXT. CORRIDOR - DAY \nBurke and Nan returning from lunch. \nNAN So, thanks for lunch. I hope this leads to an evening date. Though I have to stay home with my daughter, Leslie, on Saturdays. \nBURKE (sincerely) Yeah, okay. You were very interesting to talk to. I swear to God. Honest. No kidding. You really were. \nNAN I believe you. (sincerely) And I was very surprised what you were like when you weren't working. There was absolutely no difference. You want to see where we do the tracking? \nBURKE (excited) Is it okay? \nINT. TRACKING ROOM - DAY \nThe enter the room containing a maze of telephone cubbies with workers manning the phones. \nNAN Nobody ever wants to see how we do the polling, but they're like little starved puppies when the data comes in--running at you, scrambling to... \nBurke hardly hears. He is awed as if by a cathedral. \nVARIOUS WORKERS 1) How often do you go to the movies? 2) I'm going to describe a movie in one sentence and then ask you to rate it on a scale of... \nBURKE (as the workers continue) I love this. This is what counts and this is where you count it. \nNAN (soft and true) That's the same way I feel. \nBURKE You phone all over--you know what movies they're waiting to see, whether your TV spots are working. You know what the country thinks. \nWORKER ...what feelings do you have about Cher as a singer, an actress, or potential date... \nBURKE (again) ...and it's accurate. \nNAN Within six-point-eight percent. \nBURKE And you can't fix it... right? \nNAN No... no... Sometimes just for myself, I can't resist asking America a personal question. \nBURKE Like? \nNAN (simply) When do you feel more worthless-- mornings or afternoons? \nBURKE I gotta get back. \nThey pause by a workers to say goodbye. \nWORKER Assume Michelle Pfeiffer is the woman-- which of these 67 actors would you most like to see her with... Patrick Swayze, Keanu Reeves, Dustin Hoffman, Johnny Dep, the guy from 'Major Dad'... \nNAN There's something I meant to tell you. You may have noticed something unusual about me. \nBURKE I gotta get back. \nNAN I could never find the right time to... \nJEANNIE No one will ever love me as much as you do. \nMatt and the Marshal exchange a look of mutual horror. \nBETH Good. Now, concentrate with all your muscles and remember everything I'm about to say to you... \nThe Marshal and Matt shift uncomfortably. \nBETH Don't talk to strangers. They may be killers. Take your vitamins so the poison in the food can't hurt you. What else now? \nJEANNIE'S VOICE Teeth. \nBETH'S VOICE Right. Thank you. Brush right after you eat or your gums will start to bleed in your sleep and choke you. \nThe Marshal and Matt can stand no more--they each call to her... \"Beth... Beth... Mrs. Hobbs... Beth.\" She looks out and then walks to them. \nBETH What? I'm giving Jeannie her reminders. \nMATT Reminders?!? You can't say things like that to a little... \nBETH No. Don't. No. Don't dare. Don't criticize the way I mother or I think I'll start to scream and never st... \nMARSHAL Mrs. Hobbs. \nBETH (suddenly cheery) Yes. \nMARSHAL You know, I've been involved with this sort of thing for a long time. \nBETH You're not going to criticize me, are you? Not in front of him--because all he's done is send Jeannie these long, stupid letters. He doesn't even realize she can't read. He sends letters to someone who can't read. (laughs) It's almost funny. \nMATT I thought you'd read them to her. \nBETH (realizing) Oh. \nMARSHAL I'm not faulting you. You love your daughter and this is a very tough thing to go through. You feel guilty and caring and it all gets mixed up so that there's so much important stuff going down that there's no sure way of dealing with it, but the best thing you can do is just make sure you love her. \nBETH Typical cop talk. (on his look) But I understand what you're trying to say. Thank you. Can I have another minute with her? \nShe returns to the doorway which still only provides us with glimpses as she SINGS, \"DON'T TALK TO STRANGERS.\" The CAMERA MOVES down the hallway to INTRODUCE JEANNIE, trying to puzzle things out as she sits amongst a ridiculous number of suitcases. \nINT. SITTING ROOM - DAY \nAs the two females who bear his name approach. Matt doesn't want a pregnant first moment with Jeannie, so he wards off silence with chatter. Unfortunately, he can only think of one word. \nMATT Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi. \nJEANNIE (laughing mirthlessly) Hello, monster-poop. \nMATT (to U.S. Marshal) She has her mother's sense of humor. \nBeth stops him with a look, then bends down. \nBETH Okay, love, Mommy's going to help others who need her for a few years, and you're going with Daddy as I explained. (to Marshal and Matt) We'll all have to help with the luggage. \nEXT. BETH'S HOUSE - DAY - LONG SHOT \nAll three adults and Jeannie sharing the burden of the luggage as they move towards the cab. Mother and child hug. Matt struck by his child's plight, him. \nBETH (turning to Matt) Beginning now, you must give less value to your own happiness and well- being, then hopefully, you will reach the point where you give that no value whatsoever. Give her everything. There's no such thing as spoiling a child. \nMAN Even if you have to steal to do it? \nBETH You don't really want to mess with me, do you? \nMAN (simple honesty) No. \nMATT (to Jeannie) Okay, sweetie. We have to go. \nJEANNIE (to Beth) I want to go with you. \nBETH Can't, pretty-heart. I'm sorry. \nTears fall from Jeannie's eyes. \nJEANNIE Not even a compromise? \nBETH (thinking) The compromise will be that you don't have to ride in back; you can ride up front with the driver... okay? \nMATT What? \nJEANNIE Okay. \nAs Beth buckles Jeannie into the front seat, Matt gets in the back, alone, feeling preposterous. Beth nods to the Marshal, who surreptitiously handcuffs her. \nAs Matt makes his way back, the Flight Attendant uses a hidden latch to open the door. Music building--then calming, the worst is over. Matt makes his way back to his seat, shell- shocked. The Attendant leans over him. \nFLIGHT ATTENDANT She wants to be alone. So we're upgrading her. \nHe just nods. \nFULL SHOT \nDown the aisle--Jeannie lets an Attendant lead her as she peers back at her dad. \nEXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nMatt carrying the sleeping child like a sack over his shoulder, also managing to hold onto all her luggage. \nINT. MATT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nHe has propped her on the sofa, a cotton nightgown out. He is unbuttoning her dress. She opens her eyes, the window's protective bars PLACING A SHADOW ACROSS HER FACE. She attempts to cover her fear. \nJEANNIE These are the wrong jammies. \nMATT Okay... so what do we do? \nJeannie mimics him perfectly under her breath. She goes to an open suitcase and throws things on the floor until she finds the right jammies. \nJEANNIE Where do I sleep? \nMATT I have a sleeping bag and bed. Which one do you want? \nShe surveys her pitiful choice; then points to the sleeping bag. \nJEANNIE That. \nShe gets into it. He zips her up--then she says something remarkably unexpected. \nJEANNIE Hug. \nAmazed, Matt hugs her. A half-beat, then: \nJEANNIE (sharply) Let go. \nHe does--then stands and looks down at her. She looks back, mocking his stare with one of her own. \nINT. BATHROOM - DAY \nNan uncertainly enters this decidedly masculine bathroom. She is wearing an evening gown. The sun streams through the lush foliage outside a wall-sized window. MUSIC as she opens her purse and removes a pillbox; at one point lightly singing a snatch of lyric concerning the conflicts of being a single woman and a single mother--this while totally focused on the pills. \nINSERT - PILL BOX \nA major movie shot of this compartmentalized box. Each burrowed nest clearly labeled for the pill it contains: VITAMIN B, VITAMIN A, OSCILLOCOCCINUM, PROZAC, CALCIUM, TEST DRUG, ASPIRIN, XANAX, ETC. \nON NAN \nMUSIC CONTINUES. She dials a phone number while arching her neck and swallowing one pill after another with little swigs of water. This process continuing, even as she speaks into the phone. \nNAN Monica--is Leslie up yet? Good. I didn't want you to get worried when you realized I wasn't there. I'm still with that man. I'll tell you about it later. But it's sure nice to have wobbly legs again. Look, today's recycling day for Leslie at school, so give her some empty cans... well, then dump some out for her! Tell her I had to leave real early for work and I'll pick her up at school myself to make up for it and we'll rent any cassette she wants for tonight. Thank you... Take good care. \nShe hangs up. Another snatch of lyric as she bends to brush her teeth with her finger; prepares herself and opens the door to greet her new lover. \nINT. BURKE'S MASTER BEDROOM - DAY \nBurke sits on the edge of the bed, fearful. He sees her. \nBURKE Oh, I thought you took off in the middle of the night. \nShe moves quickly to him. \nNAN No. I just had to call home. Is that why you're sad? \nBURKE No. It's Everett. This kid who used to work for me. He was always crazy to do his own movie. \nNAN (fearing worst) What happened? \nBURKE (very down) His movie not only opened to a three million dollar Friday--it's gotten great reviews. \nNan is dumbfounded; still she puts a hand on him, actually consoling him for his hideous thought--Hollywood lovers: he, wrapped up with ill thoughts of others; she, feeling intimate, yet severely compromised. Cupid's work is done. \nBURKE (again) Listen. I'm tremendously worried about 'Ground Zero' because of the bad 'want to sees' you sent over. But that's just me being nervous over nothing, isn't it? \nNAN No. That's just you correctly assessing the situation. So stop being so hard on yourself. \nHe eyes her, then: \nINT. MATT'S HALLWAY - NIGHT \nBurke walks tight little circles near Cathy and the rest of his staff while a few feet away Studio Executives stand in a cluster. There is a DISTANT, RHYTHMIC SHUFFLING SOUND. Burke walks past Cathy. \nBURKE Nothing good that happens tonight can make it worth feeling the way I do right now. Nothing. (turning to Cathy) What do you think? \nCATHY (nervously taking the plunge) To be honest, I had problems with 'Ground Zero.' But this 'People Get Hurt' one, while it might not be my exact, exact thing, I think will really work for an audience. It's so over the top, you have a great time. \nBURKE So you think it'll score big? \nCATHY Yes. \nINT. COUNTING ROOM - NIGHT \nWhere we discover the SOURCE OF THE SOUND. Some twenty card- counters on the floor riffling through stacks of cards with erasers. Matt and Nan stand in the doorway. \nNAN Don't worry. My daughter used to throw fits in supermarkets when we first moved here. It's all so perfectly normal. Plus I know a great psychiatric children's group. \nMATT That's what breaks your heart. Jeannie's problem is that she's so down on herself. \nNAN Well, she's lucky to have a daddy who cares, believe me. \nMATT I don't know if lucky's the word. I'm hoping she's asleep when I get home so I won't have to deal with her... I'm actually afraid of my own kid. \nNAN Oh, my. I've had exactly that feeling and never said it out loud. See, there are men who talk my language and I'm just cursed that I'm not attracted to them because they are so nice they remind me of myself. \nMatt laughs. In the b.g., the counting is completed. \nGROUP CAPTAIN Excellents? \nGIRL COUNTER Seven. \nGROUP CAPTAIN Very goods? \nBOY COUNTER \nGROUP CAPTAIN Fairs? \nSECOND BOY CARD COUNTER \nGROUP CAPTAIN Poors? \nSECOND GIRL CARD COUNTER Just a second... (finishes counting) \nThe Group Captain notes the figure on a sheet, walks to the doorway and hands it to Nan, who is still deep into conversation with Matt. She begins walking back to the theater without looking at the sheet in her hand. \nNAN I felt terrible about the way I blew up at you when I first met you. (before he can object) Please. \nFULL SHOT - THEATER AREA - NIGHT \nBurke and others waiting as Matt and Nan come to a stop some distance away. \nBURKE What are they doing? \nNAN I began taking anti-depressants when we moved here from Washington. I had some small reactions--sleeping 14 hours, no libido, I gained 17 pounds in nine days--that sort of thing. So they gave me pills to deal with the side effects. And then pills to deal with the side effects I was getting from those pills. All this besides the stuff the nutritionist was giving me. The combination formed some sort of potion so that I keep telling the truth. I don't have a choice. That's why I was so rude to you. \nMATT Your doctor says this? \nNAN Oh, yes. He's excited, but only because he sees glory for himself in it... See, ordinarily I wouldn't say that about my doctor, but I can't help it, it's the truth. He's monitoring me for a while longer before writing it up for this medical journal... \nCathy has joined them. \nCATHY Burke's going crazy waiting for the score. \nNAN Coming. \nCATHY (to Matt) How are you, anyway? \nMatt shifts, figuring out his answer. \nCATHY (a small laugh) It's a tough one, huh? Me too. \nNan looks down at the score. \nNAN Oh, my. Matt, I'd better drive him myself. \nShe starts for Burke. \nON BURKE AND OTHERS \nAs Nan arrives and hands the Studio Executives the score, Burke looking over their shoulders. \nBURKE I can fix this... Get some narration written. . . (turning to Director) You'll cut 30 minutes. It will come out like butter. \nDIRECTOR We're only 77 minutes now... \nMILLIE Well, I wanted to put in people we had a shot at getting. \nMALE D PERSON (reading from list) F. Murray Abraham, Jeff Daniels, Ed Harris, John Lithgow, Rip Torn, Willem Dafoe, John Malkovich... For an action lead? \nMILLIE Could you at least take it one person at a time instead of... \nMALE D PERSON Okay. Let's play 'State the Obvious'... F. Murray Abraham has a nose as long as an Aspen ski line, Ed Harris is losing his hair, Joe Mantegna has never played the lead in a big movie... Willem Dafoe's teeth... Bob Hoskins looks fur bearing when he takes off his shirt... Malkovich... \nMatt can take it no more. He hears a loud voice coming from his own throat. He wigs out. \nMATT I can't stand it anymore. I can't. \nCATHY What's wrong? What happened? \nMATT What, in God's name, are you doing in this job you have? \nSHOT \nAs they all start to answer at once. \nMATT I mean him. What, in God's name, do you know about casting? \nMALE D PERSON Me? \nMatt rises and walks towards the Male D Person. \nMATT Yes. What do you know? About anything? You don't even know you have a habit of touching your tongue with a finger like you want to lick yourself. (note: this is his little habit) Yet, you talk like you actually know something... So I want you to tell me... (louder) ...what you know. \nMALE D PERSON I'm not going to be drawn into this. \nMATT I've been an actor most of my life and this is the first time I've ever heard what the people calling the shots sound like when they're casting. So I really want to find out what, if anything, you know because what if nothing you know. \nFEMALE D PERSON I don't think the yelling is necessary. \nMATT Oh, you couldn't be more wrong. And I'm not talking to you. And I don't like you. \nMALE D PERSON How about you just mind your own business? \nMatt is very close to him--he shakes his chair. \nMATT You're minding my business. That's the problem... so, just tell me, what do you know? \nON MALE D PERSON \nMatt's manner is threatening. The Male D Person looks around for some support and finds little... then Matt's tone changes... it's reasonable, almost seductive. \nMATT Just tell me and I'll shut up. \nMALE D PERSON (taking the bait) First of all, I've been going to movies since I was six, for God's sake... \nMATT What you know is the size of a schnozz. What you don't know is that these guys... (indicates list) ...are for real... \nON CATHY \nShe is a ricochet victim of every word Matt says, as he continues to indict the Male D Person and unknowingly reach her instead. His fury grows and becomes more complicated, containing an element of mourning. \nMATT (again) ...that they can make something happen, and even they don't know what that is till they get in there and play a little... they can make something happen that you can't even imagine... and it's not your fault, this stupidity... 'cause you're just this scared little prick who gets to say he's making movies, and the only thing they ever taught you is that what you like doesn't matter. \nMALE D PERSON (frightened) Thanks for understanding. \nThe anger leaves Matt. He is depleted. \nMATT But isn't it almost good manners for you to feel a little shame? \nCathy rises and begins to exit. \nMATT (again) I didn't mean you. \nCATHY If you didn't, you sure should have. \nShe exits. The D Person's Colleagues have taken advantage of the beat to egg him on. \nMALE D PERSON You talk about manners--are you actually so bitter you don't realize how you acted just now? You're gone, pal. But at least know that we can't help that we're making it. \nMATT Oh, shit. You win. You got lucky with 'bitter.' That word just scares me to death. \nINT. STAIRWELL - DAY \nA distraught Cathy is walking down as Burke bounds up. \nBURKE You look down. \nCATHY I am. \nMATT'S VOICE Cathy? \nCATHY Yes. \nMATT'S VOICE I'll buzz you in. You've got to be quick and push hard. \nIn the b.g. WE HEAR Jeannie loudly imploring her father to make the person wait till she's finished dressing. There is the SOUND OF the buzzer. Cathy hurls herself at the door a good four times before finally timing it right and gathering the necessary strength to spill through. \nINT. MATT'S HALLWAY - EVENING \nCathy stands there overhearing the voices from inside. \nJEANNIE'S VOICE But why can't I stay just a little while? \nMATT'S VOICE Because this is a very special friend of Daddy's and I need privacy... Be fair... I let you wear that dress. \nCathy knocks. Matt opens the door. \nMATT Hi. \nHe steps aside so Cathy may enter... The place is tidied up. He has changed his clothes and Jeannie is wearing a lace dress, fit for a young princess, complete with flowered tiara and ballet slippers, with trailing blue ribbons at the heels and a velvet cape. \nMATT This is my daughter, Queen Elizabeth. Jeannie, this is Cathy. \nCATHY Hi... What a pretty dress. \nJEANNIE Thank you. That's nice. \nON MATT \nHappy that Jeannie is behaving so well. \nCATHY Are you going to a party? \nJEANNIE (wildly hopeful) Am I going to a party, Dad? \nMATT (quickly) No. You're going next door. \nJeannie is crest-fallen; for a horrible second, it looks as if she may start to wail... Matt moves into action with a pep talk. \nMATT Remember our compromise? You're going next door to Lucy's to play and you'll show the kids your dress and I'll come get you later and we'll go out someplace and I'll buy you anything you want for under seventeen dollars? \nJEANNIE I remember. \nShe starts for the door, doubles back, and kisses a surprised Cathy full on the lips... The gesture is beautifully, even movingly carried off. It is totally false. \nJEANNIE (again to Cathy) Goodbye. I love you... \nCATHY (totally thrown) Well,... thank you. \nJeannie is on the run... as she passes her father. \nMATT (sotto) Thanks. \nJeannie nods acknowledgment as she flies past. \nOTHER ANGLE \nFavoring Cathy, Matt leans out the doorway until Jeannie is safely next door, then re-enters. \nCATHY What a little winner, huh? \nMATT (modestly) Oh...? \nCATHY (waving script) This is my favorite project. And it looks like we're going ahead with it. \nMATT (overlap) 'Mr. Deeds Goes to Town?' Oh, it's a remake... \nCATHY Well, come on, what's original? And this is a wonderful rewrite. It's funnier. \nMATT And there's a part in it for... \nCATHY Yes... Burke says I can test whoever I want. He wasn't even surprised when I mentioned you. So, if you could read this rewrite now and if you like it, we can make a test deal... (catching herself) they can make a test deal... we can tell them that they can make a test deal. (in explanation) I think it's important for me to steer clear of the business end. \nMATT Okay... which part? \nCATHY Longfellow Deeds. \nMATT Mr. Deeds? \nCATHY Who goes to town, yes. \nMatt takes this in... takes this miracle in. \nCATHY There are some mixed signals coming out of here, aren't there? (phone rings; she answers) Hi. Working... I can't write down a number now. Call me back. (to Matt) The script? \nMATT It's really good. I get a little nervous thinking about the opportunity. \nCATHY I want to hear everything. You want to go page by page? \nMATT If it's okay. I kind of work on these things in a private... it's just... it's a little better for me if I don't... \nCATHY (hurt) Okay. \nMATT Okay, let's do it. It won't kill me. \nCATHY Please. I understand. \nAn uncertain beat and then she leans over and kisses him. A sound escapes him. They get up and begin walking to the bedroom. \nMATT I swear to God, I don't know which thing I want more, the sex or the conversation afterwards. \nCATHY (a smile) What do you mean? \nINT. CATHY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nAs they enter and move to the bed where Matt starts undressing. \nMATT I mean I haven't been to bed with anyone since Jeannie got here... I haven't talked to anyone the way I need to. (cradling her breast) I haven't seen anything this beautiful. I haven't felt this good about life. I mean, I've been lonely, Cathy. \nCATHY (as he enters her) I'll tell you the truth, Matt. I've never felt more like turning my phone off. \nShe twists her body gracefully, sexily towards the phone. \nMATT You can't shut the phone off. I left this number with Jeannie's sitter. \nCATHY I don't understand what you're worried about. \nMATT I'm not worried. But if the phone was off, I would worry. \nCATHY But I get a lot of calls. \nMATT Oh. \nCATHY I could put the machine on 'monitor,' but it's going to be... I don't know. \nMATT It will be okay. I think the most important thing is to stop talking about the phone. Turn it off, monitor, whatever. \nCATHY Okay. \nShe twists toward the phone again--not quite so beautifully. \nOTHER ANGLE \nAs she hits the \"monitor\" button, then turns back to him. \nCATHY You look so serious. \nMATT I am so serious. \nCATHY'S POV \nMatt totally there... this is major for him, then he does something sensitive... reads her concern over the depth of his need and interest and shrugs, indicating he can't help it. \nON CATHY \nShe likes him. \nTHE COUPLE \nAs they make love... their union thrown off kilter by the phone messages which roll in periodically as they thrust and sweat towards intimacy. \nYOUNGER MALE VOICE (broadly) Hi, Cathy... All my magazines came today... Read the new Vanity Fair, they take apart three people we hate... Spy is bad this month... Scorsese didn't get the Time cover, the plane crash did... ha, ha, ha... Why aren't you at the office? You know, I'm getting to the point where I prefer to reach people's machines... Bye. \nThe love making continues as the calls continue. \nMALE D PERSON VOICE Cathy? Are you there? Hello... Are you there?? I'm going to count to ten. One, two, three... (then to someone passing his office) Did you go to the screening last night? What did you think? That makes two bombs in a row for her. (into phone) ...four, five, six... Pick up if you're there. I've got major gossip... major screwup. It could be good for us. \nCathy, in the throes of sexual union, feeling a bit divided by the offer on the phone... she shakes it off. \nMATT Is this the kind of crap you listen to all day? \nCATHY Please, we're making love here. \nBURKE'S VOICE (incredibly depressed) If the TV show bombs, there's going to be a dance party on my grave. I don't give a crap. Nothing seems to have a point anymore. I'm really questioning everything... including action-adventure... Don't tell anyone I'm down. Even destroy the message tape. Don't tell anyone I said to destroy the message tape. Don't even give hints that there's something you can't tell them, but you wish you could... I'm losing it. I'm losing it. I'm losing it. Don't tell nobody. Don't tell nobody. Don't tell nobody. \nThe sound of a hang up... the couple having more difficulty making love... \nCASTING PERSON Wow. \nINT. POPCORN PICTURES HALLWAY - SEVERAL HOURS LATER \nMatt making his way past the last of the kid stragglers. Cathy and Jeannie come running up to him. \nMATT It felt great... Everybody... \nJEANNIE Let me tell him, let me tell him, let me tell him... \nCATHY (highly annoyed) Let him finish! God! \nJEANNIE I want to tell him. \nCATHY If you wait one minute, I'll let you. \nJeannie turns down her volume, but keeps repeating--incanting actually... \"I can't wait to tell him... I can't wait to tell him... I can't wait to tell him...\" \nMATT Anyway, the girl I did it with, by the way, she's really good; the director, the crew... they all thought we nailed it. \nCATHY (loving, sexy) Hey. \nJEANNIE (to Cathy) Now? \nCathy nods and Jeannie begins to push Matt into Cathy's office for privacy. \nCATHY Wait till you hear this one. \nINT. CATHY'S OFFICE \nJeannie sits her father down. This is the first time we've seen her joyful. Pure glee. \nJEANNIE Some lady asked me to go in a room and, you know, make believe and say stuff like we were playing a game... \nThe words coming so fast that Jeannie lets loose with a bolt of SONG, as if taking a moment to catch her breath. Just a few sung lines proclaiming happiness. \nJEANNIE (again) And everybody went 'yea' and they said they wanted me to be on television. \nAnd the SUNG PHRASE. \nJEANNIE And give me money and have a teacher there and a person to braid my hair and color my face and give me clothes... \nThe sung phrase again. \nON MATT \nStricken. \nMATT You wait here, Jeannie. \nINT. CATHY'S OUTER OFFICE - DAY \nSeveral people milling about... Matt eyes Cathy. We still hear Jeannie's muffled singing from the other side of the door. \nMATT (furious) I have to talk to you. \nEXT. POPCORN PICTURES - DAY \nAs Matt and Cathy come into frame... Matt forcefully placing her with her back to the wall. She is not one to be pushed around. \nCATHY Don't! \nMATT What in hell is wrong with you? You actually think... \nCATHY I'm trying to hang in here but everything in me cuts off when somebody acts this way. \nMATT (continuing right along) ...that you can have my kid audition for a show without asking me. \nCATHY I didn't... She went for water and by the time she got back, they had offered her the part. Blame Burke, he was there... \nMatt takes this in. Just a millimeter underneath his fury is professional curiosity. \nMATT What's the part, anyway? \nCATHY The white kid in a multi-racial foster home with all these kids of varying ages. It's not a bad show. I sure can't wait to see the test. \nMATT How were they able to test her so fast? \nCATHY No. They offered it to her off the reading. I meant your test. \nMATT Oh... A child actor. Just what any kid with problems needs to straighten out--a series of her own... \nCathy has nothing to offer. Matt begins leading her back. We HOLD ON THEIR BACKS and see the chink in Matt's confidence, hear the tightness in his voice as he asks: \nMATT Oh, that I was crazy. You always wear your hair back like that? \nShe kisses him. We HEAR the director say, \"Cut. Terrific, guys.\" The girl and Matt hug, no longer in character, as others come in to congratulate them. \nINT. SCREENING ROOM - DAY \nAd-libbed enthusiasm... mostly about the girl... \nON CATHY \nAs the conversation about the girl grows more pointed... Cathy, impassive outwardly, recoiling inwardly. \nBURKE Okay, come on... let's have our creative meeting right here. \nMALE D PERSON Well, I'd sure go to bed with her. \nBURKE (professionally concurring) Very fuckable. \nMALE CASTING PERSON I'd sure fuck her. \nBURKE Okay... that's her... What about him? \nFEMALE D PERSON I think he's a very good to excellent actor--I do... (puzzled) But there's something... \nBURKE You wouldn't want to fuck him? \nFEMALE D PERSON Well, six years ago, maybe. \nCLAIRE I think he's talented and attractive. \nBURKE So you'd want to fuck him? \nCLAIRE He might be light in that area. \nCATHY The man is talented. If you get one of those directors who like actors, I think... \nBURKE A director can't make you hot if you're not hot. You'll end up with warm which is death. \nCATHY (defending Matt slightly) We laughed. \nBURKE Let me ask you something... Would you fuck him? \nCATHY (wearily) Everything doesn't boil down to... \nBURKE Let me stop you before you embarrass yourself. \nBurke rises and addresses his staff... the camera has his back in the foreground as it MOVES TOWARDS A RENDEZVOUS, Burke moving too as he continues... \nBURKE (again) We all can do our little lectures on what things boil down to. Everybody else here was professional enough to come out and say... I'd fuck her... I wouldn't fuck him... and you're ducking it... I want you to forget the acting stuff and totally focus on the issue. \nAnd now Burke and CAMERA meet up--the effect being that he is talking directly to us as he continues. \nBURKE (again) We do have some kind of responsibility to the audience... You just saw his screentest... so, if this is the first time you saw the guy, do you come out thinking to yourself and your girl friends, 'I'd sure go to bed with him; oh God, would he be something.' Would you, Cathy?... I'm being real here. \nCATHY No... \nBURKE Okay, so let's keep looking. \nThey file out. Cathy gets up several beats later than the others... and follows them out, avoiding Nan's look. \nINT. CATHY'S OFFICE - EARLY EVENING \nShe's been sitting here for quite a while... she can postpone no longer; she dials as one of her MOVIE SOUND TRACKS PLAYS in the background. \nCATHY (into phone) Hello. Matt... Hi... Okay, sure... \nShe listens, waiting for him to quiet Jeannie. \nCATHY (again) Matt... (louder) Matt... Matt... Maybe it would be easier if I just said 'hi' to her... Hi, Jeannie... Yes, it's exciting... No, no. He's right, honey, they get somebody to read it to you. Now, put your dad on--it's important. No, first put your dad on... DAMN IT! (she waits a beat) ...Matt. Uh-huh, a few hours ago... They all... everyone liked your work, but I think they'll go for a name or something. \nShe listens to him. He is hurt. Cathy, though, is also wrestling with her own internal struggles. She has betrayed him and is ashamed; in a strange way--terrified. She is, therefore, just a little irritable. \nCATHY (again) It's not a matter of doing it differently... they liked what you did, a lot... they laughed and... it's not you... it's them. (suddenly her breath comes weird) No, please. Don't thank me. If you feel like getting together later or anytime, call me, okay? You sound like you have your hands full right now... Goodbye. \nINT. MATT'S APT. - NIGHT \nAs he hangs up... \nJEANNIE I wanted to talk to her again... I... \nShe stops in mid-sentence, looking at her father. He is overcome... his energy failing to get him past this most awful moment in his life. She moves to his side. He starts to cry and, urgently seeking privacy, he moves quickly towards the bathroom, rubbing Jeannie in an instinctive gesture of reassurance. He closes the door. \nON JEANNIE \nEXT. POPCORN PICTURES - DAY \nAs the car arrives outside Popcorn Pictures, we can SEE some child actors and their parents arriving at the sound stage next door. \nMATT Are you going to need me? The kids are rehearsing and I'd like to take a look. \nBURKE Yeah, sure. I have to stay inside during lunch hours now anyway--that's when everybody returns my calls because they're trying to miss me. \nMATT (amazed) Is that true? \nBURKE (misinterpreting) Yeah. Thanks for the support. \nINT. TV STUDIO - DAY \nA row of parents standing near their child actors, adjusting them--not unlike handlers of racing Greyhounds. \nON JEANNIE \nSeen from a distance--her father behind her. In the foreground, the mass of workers on the stage, It is, in effect, her POV, even though she is in the extreme background of the shot. We MOVE CLOSER to Jeannie and her father--even a bit behind them. Jeannie is scared. \nMATT I bet I know what it looks like to you. \nJEANNIE What? \nMATT A giant \"find Waldo.\" \nDespite herself, she smiles at the reference, though her tone is a bit sarcastic. \nJEANNIE Very funny. \nPASSING VOICE Five minutes, children, then we need you for work on the set. \nJEANNIE Set? \nMATT That pretend living room, right over there. \nJEANNIE Okay. Set. Bye... \nMATT (holding her arm) Wait a second, Jeannie. Let Daddy give you a few tips here. \nJEANNIE (twisting away) Nooo. I've got to get to work. \nShe breaks free, depriving Matt of the sweet and simple moment he wanted with her. She's one of the first ones on the set, other kids still hugging their parents. As Cathy comes up behind Matt, we can HEAR Jeannie who, having so small a trust for her father, needs to confirm what he just told her. \nJEANNIE (faintly) Is this the set? \nMatt reacts. \nPASSING VOICE Parents to Room Two, please. (as he goes by Matt) Parents to Room Two, please. \nJeannie is watching. \nPASSING VOICE (again) We have to clear the set. \nMatt looks him off fiercely. The Passing Voice addresses the friendlier parents. \nPASSING VOICE (again) This way, parents. \nCATHY I'm glad I found you. \nMATT Hi. \nOTHER AREA - BEHIND GRANDSTAND SEATS \nAs they walk. \nCATHY You holding up? What did you do last night after I called? \nMATT (as if teasing) What do you think I did? I cried like a baby. \nCATHY Okay. Okay. So you don't want to tell me. Be a tough guy. \nMATT Now you got it. \nCATHY I feel relieved just seeing you after all that stuff... whew... Okay. (preparing to go) Burke wants to... \nMATT You ever go out with him? \nCathy is as simple and direct as she is embarrassed. \nCATHY Yes. \nMATT You slept with him? \nJEANNIE You don't make sense. I don't understand you. \nMATT I think you do. \nJeannie reacts broadly... indicating what a difficult man she's stuck with. \nMATT Just know that... \nJEANNIE Okayyyy! \nMATT (giving up) You want to help me make a phone call? \nShe goes quickly to the phone and picks it up. \nMATT Seven... two... \nJEANNIE (hitting numbers) Who are we calling? \nMATT Cathy. She's very nice. One... six... \nJEANNIE (hard to read) \"Very nice...\" One... \nINT. CATHY'S HOUSE - DAY \nAs she answers phone. \nJEANNIE'S VOICE Hi... (to Matt) What now? \nMATT'S VOICE IN BACKGROUND \nTell her, 'How are you' and then let me... \nJEANNIE'S VOICE How are you? \nCATHY Jeannie... I can't talk now because... \nJEANNIE Wait, my dad wants to... \nCATHY Tell him I can't talk 'cause I'm on the phone with a director... \nJEANNIE He wants to talk to you very much and... \nCATHY (sharply) I can't. I have to hang up. \nShe does. \nINT. MATT'S APT. - NIGHT \nJeannie, truly stung by the hang-up. She takes this act of Cathy's as an insult to herself and her father. Matt doesn't feel too wonderful about it himself. \nMATT You have to understand that sometimes people are too busy. \nJEANNIE So she's too busy for you? \nINT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nBurke and Nan eating together on an elevated balcony overlooking the main eating area. \nBURKE We look like jerks eating here this early. Everybody's going to think we couldn't get a reservation for the hot hours. \nNAN Why do you do this to yourself? Why do you insist on eating dinner in a restaurant where you're bound to see all the people you're afraid of? \nBURKE I'm not afraid of them. \nNAN What do you call it when you think that what a group of people think of you can confirm or destroy any decent idea you have of yourself? \nBURKE Normal. \nNAN How did little Jeannie do today? \nBURKE Isn't it something that they have you testing the TV show? \nNAN What I asked was, how did Jeannie do? \nBURKE What are you talking about? \nNAN Somebody else. Jeannie. How did she do? \nBURKE Don't talk to me like this. \nNAN (really pissed) I want to be treated as if I'm really saying words to you which you engage and respond to. I like Matt; I'd like to know how his daughter did. So before you take your dance of desperation across the restaurant and I end up feeling so sorry for you that I could die, I would like you to answer my question. \nBURKE She did okay... and don't worry about Matt... If the pilot sells, his kid will be making five thousand a week. So what do you know about 'People Get Hurt?' \nMATT It's your choice... But I'm not helping unless you try to understand as well as memorize. It will be fun. Come on. I know it's hard... \nJEANNIE Okay. Okay... \nMATT Anything to shut me up, huh? Okay, this little girl you're pretending to be... she can't be with her Mommy either, just like you, or her father... she has to stay in Rainbow House which is called that because... (Jeannie starts fidgeting) Jeannie... (she stops) ...because everyone's a different color... so when this little girl calls the black lady who takes care of all the children this terrible word... it's like the worst thing anybody can do... Come here. \nJEANNIE (approaching him) I don't want to do the 'I love you' again. \nMATT Yeah, I might have been working you too hard on that one. \nShe is unable to resist muttering one sarcastic shot. \nJEANNIE Yeah. Why don't you do that with poopie Cathy? \nMATT (ignoring her) Now, did the director tell you how he wanted you to do it? \nJEANNIE He said to smile all the time almost and to talk... uh... \nMATT Faster? \nJEANNIE Yes. \nMATT Okay. We don't always get good directors, so it's important for us... \nJEANNIE Me. You're not in the show. \nMATT I'm referring to the family of actors, you little shithead. \nJeannie doesn't know quite how to take the name calling. MUSIC IN... we're heading for a rendezvous with a dance as it CONTINUES ACROSS THE CUT TO: \nEXT. TV STAGE - EARLY MORNING \nMatt and Jeannie walking from the catering truck. They are eating ravenously. MUSIC CONTINUES... VERY JOYOUS. \nJEANNIE This is so good... \nMATT It's a breakfast burrito. It's what actors eat when they're working. \nJEANNIE (excited) Really. \nEXT. ROOF GARDEN - DAY \nMATT Now, let's work a little more. The most important acting you do is when you listen. You're worried about being able to cry when you're supposed to, right? \nJEANNIE Yes. So much. \nMATT Well, there are really only two ways to do it. Think of something that makes you really sad... or forget you're you and really forget you're pretending... \nJEANNIE How do I do that one? \nMatt reads from script. \nMATT (as a furious Black woman) 'Don't test me, child! I could eat you for lunch when I was your age and I'm a hell of a lot bigger now!' \nJeannie looks afraid. \nMATT That's it... You just looked at me and acted right without even thinking. And there are games you can play to help you with this. Get up... (she does) Now, be my mirror... do exactly what I do... that's it... now, at a certain point, I'm going to become your mirror, but I'm not going to tell you when... you tell me... \nJEANNIE (hesitantly) Now? \nMatt nods. \nMATT (enthusiastically) Okay. We're going to make up words. The words aren't what matter now. \nJEANNIE I'm on a roof... \nMATT You're a great dad. \nJEANNIE You're a... (then stops; then smiles at him) \nThis acting exercise of Chicago's Story Theater leads into the song, \"BE MY MIRROR.\" As the song finishes, Matt and Jeannie are in the best spirits we've seen as an A.D. approaches. \nA.D. They need you. \nJEANNIE Okay. \nShe takes the A.D.'s hand as Matt calls. \nMATT You're welcome. Don't mention it. \nINT. CATHY'S OFFICE - DAY \nCathy is in mid conversation with Millie. Matt enters and boldly says his piece. \nCATHY I'll talk fast. It's amazing news. Oliver Stone's been looking for a comedy and... \nMATT (distracted) I've got to see my kid. \nCATHY (her voice breaking) ...he's doing my picture. \nMATT Hey. Good. \nHe starts off. \nCATHY Part of this involves you. He remembers you from 'Platoon' and wants to use you in this one. (he stops) Got your attention, huh? \nMatt is terminally disappointed in her last cynical sentence. \nMATT Oh, Cathy. Look, I'm going to watch this. Let me talk to you later or tomorrow. Thanks for your help. It's good news. Gotta go. \nFrom the stage, we HEAR the VOICE of the WARM-UP MAN. \nWARM-UP MAN'S VOICE First, in her first appearance ever, Jeannie Hobbs... \nThere is applause. Matt's missed her intro. \nMATT Shit. \nCATHY I'm sorry. \nMATT Why couldn't you wait till later? Shit. \nCATHY (broadly) I guess it's because I'm just incredibly insensitive to all human needs. I'd ask you to save me, but I'm so far gone, I wouldn't want you to waste your time. \nMATT (after a moment) Huh? \nShe reacts, but he walks off, not wanting to get into it. Cathy, however, has had a tricky nerve struck. She continues, biting off each word. \nCATHY You know, I don't have a kid or a mate or a talent. (holding up book bag) I got this. (she's quite upset) And shoot me if I think it's important. \nMATT'S POV \nCathy, who looks alone and adorable as we HEAR MUSIC of \"THIS LONELY LIFE OF MINE.\" He puts a comforting hand on her. She speaks nakedly from deep within herself; her eyes downcast. \nCATHY You think I'm a superficial jerk. (and then a whispered afterthought) You can't be right. \nMATT I think you're the best of the bunch. \nCATHY (broadly) Oh, great. \nAnd now she raises her eyes--big, blue and vulnerable. If this look were returned, \"I love yous\" could flow--they could sink to the floor in a joint epiphany; but there is no romance or kindling in Matt's eyes. He is in a hurry. Pridefully, Cathy turns and walks off in the opposite direction, her flight so instinctive, she forgets her book bag. We hold on this--her exit, then: \nINT. STUDIO FLOOR - BURKE AND MATT - 20 MINUTES LATER \nStanding just behind the four television cameras, immediately behind them, the \"rail\" where the Show's Staff and Crew Members and Network Bosses stand crowded, choreographed in the way in which they \"clear\" for a moving camera. Behind these people is the studio audience. There is a loud laugh. Burke turns around to study the audience. \nBURKE'S POV \nHappy faces accompanied by the strains of Burke's love song to the crowd... \nBURKE (to Matt) What do you think? \nBut Matt doesn't hear him... a few feet away, Jeannie is making ready for her big moment. Three cameras swing in front of them, TV monitors showing a MASTER and CLOSE-UPS of the three characters in the scene: a short comic WHITE MAN, the Black Female Lead, and Jeannie, dressed as a poor child. \nMATT (wide-eyed) Wait. This is it. \nANGLE - STAGE \nJEANNIE It's like everyone is pi... ticked off at me because I'm not colored. \nThe White Man jumps on the phrase. \nSHORT WHITE MAN (correcting her pompously) The word is black. \nBLACK LEAD ACTRESS (correcting him with booming voice) The word is African American. \nA burst of laughter, whooping and applause from the audience. Burke brags in a whisper to Matt. \nBURKE I had them bring in two busloads of people from black churches. \nANGLE - STAGE \nAs they play out the scene. \nBLACK LEAD ACTRESS (scolding Jeannie) Now you use it in a sentence. \nJEANNIE Look at me, I... \n", "test1_input": "BETH Do I get to vote? I'm going to tell you something I never told you before. Your feeling towards your work is one of the things I love most about you. \nMATT Really? \nBETH Maybe the most. \nMATT Hey, then we have no problem here. Marry me. \nThey kiss, then break, murmuring to each other. \nBETH Stinker, I almost gave up on you. \nMATT I was just worried whether I could make you happy. \nMORPH TO: \nINT. HOSPITAL WAITING AREA - FOUR A.M. \nA SET FRAME showing several clusters of waiting people. A man rushes to one of these clusters, cueing this group to sing the next phrase of \"WOW\". As an extremely hyper Matt enters, the SONG STOPS and a legend appears: \nMATT (extremely hyper) Everything's okay... Great... She's six or eight pounds even. Oh, God... Nothing like it. I'll tell you something amazing. They really reach right into her stomach and pull out this baby. It's not just a rumor. God. I understand the expression 'mind blowing' for the first time. It means something so wonderful happens that the top of your head comes off and your brain pops out. Part of it was terrifying, the baby was turned and they couldn't budge her. I kept looking at this one woman doctor's eyes. And when Jeannie finally came out, this doctor and I each wiped away a tear at the exact same time, caught ourselves doing it, and then laughed together at the same time. Nothing can prepare you for it. You know why you're alive. \nINT. CORRIDOR - DAY \nAs Matt walks with pep, accompanied by a burst of \"WOW\". \nINT. BETH'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY \nBeth holds BABY JEANNIE and wears a scowl. \nMATT How you doing? What's wrong? \nBETH My mother said you were flirting with the doctor during the delivery. \nOn Matt's expression... \nMORPH TO: \nINT. MODEST ONE-BEDROOM APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT \nMatt and Beth lie on an open sofa-bed. \"WOW\" is completed, though with a dirge-like cadence. We hear a baby crying over a cheap walky-talky near their bed. \nMATT Could you get her, honey? I have that big reading tomorrow. \nBETH No, I have a lot to do tomorrow, too. I have to borrow on our Christmas Club, I have to... \nMATT Don't worry about money anymore. (on her look) I didn't want to tell you, because it may sound a little strange when I say it out loud. You know me, I'm never that cocky. But I'm going to get 'Spider Woman'. It's me or Raul and I've never been so sure. It's weird, but I just know it. I do. \nBETH (broadly) Boy, am I reassured. What good news. Isn't that a load off? \nINT. BABY'S ROOM - NIGHT \nWhere we see the crying baby holding the walky-talky in front of its mouth as it screams into the mouthpiece. \nBACK TO SCENE \nMATT I am gonna get this part, Beth. \nBETH I can't stand this anymore. \nEND MAIN TITLES \nFADE IN: \nINT. MATT'S APARTMENT - MORNING \nIt's an awful place... the start-up apartment he's way too old for... but we don't yet see his humble quarters. Rather: \nA BLURRED IMAGE \nThen, the screen is CLEARED ON ONE HALF so we see half of a contact lens holder in focus--the other half blurred--until Matt gets his second contact in. \nMATT'S POV \nA tube of tooth bleach. CLOSE ON THE DIRECTIONS, then: \nON MATT \nBleaching his teeth... finishing... smiling in the mirror... This is the bleached smile of fear--true fear--the awful state of having lost your way. The phone rings. Matt clears his voice before answering. \nMATT (into phone) Hello... Hi, Beth. I'm glad you finally returned my call. What are you so mad about? (again, into phone) YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SCREAM, I CAN SCREAM, TOO. \nMatt was so suddenly, emotionally extended that the anger leaves him that quickly... just a strange atypical lightning bolt of rage toward life and women. \n", "test1_true": "He rubs his head with both hands, including the one holding the phone. This allows us to hear his ex-wife repeat the same sentence over and over again. \nBETH (V. O.) (from phone) ...You're taking her... You're taking her... You're taking her... \nMATT Beth, I know exactly how long it's been and I feel strange as hell not seeing her but this isn't a choice. I'm broke. It's the driest spell of my life. I'm not saying it's your problem, but it's no place for a six- year-old. What can I do? The only full-time job I seem to have is not showing how scared I am. What? No, that's not something I said before. (accepting compliment) Well, thanks. \nBeth turns angry again. Matt finds, unfortunately, that he's got one more act of bravado left. \nMATT (again, into phone) Beth, Hey... hey. Never mind, I'll do it. \nHe hangs up. \nMATT (again, to himself) I must get work. I will take anything. I must get work. I must not be embarrassed by these pep talks to myself... \nEXT. SIDE STREET - DAY \nAs Matt walks from the outdoor parking lot, past inexpensive homes. In the lot, on private lawns and every public bench, at each street corner, are various actors doing the relaxation exercises which will form the basis of A DANCE, as they go over their \"sides\". \nMIDDLE-AGED ACTOR ...feathers I'm blowing. What am I, a duck? \nWe pass various actors going over alternate sentences for the same speech so that we get a sense of the speech as a whole from the sum of its parts. \nVARIOUS YOUNG ACTORS 1) I'm not thinking about whether I'm going to shoot you. I'm... 2)...trying to decide where. 3)...the little spot behind the ear where you die before you hear the shot... 4)...on the left side of the belly which is a very mean place. \nEXT. POPCORN PICTURES - DAY \nAn office building of clear architectural merit located in an industrial area. Even the sign \"Popcorn Pictures\" has all the artistic dignity the name itself lacks... MUSIC ENTERS... Gradually, movement BECOMES CHOREOGRAPHED...i.e., the young actor and actress running across the street do so with uncommon grace. The area Matt passes is very crowded and we still haven't reached the most congested area of all as we STUDY FACES and HEAR snatches of the actors' preparation. \nMIDDLE-AGED ACTOR What am I, a duck? \nOLDER ACTRESS Sure I'll tell you... Favor first... Do a nice middle-aged lady a favor... A fair trade... tell you what you want to know in return for a... (grimaces over dialogue she must say) ...a pity fu... \nMUSIC BECOMING MORE INSISTENT as we approach the building-- the mumbling of the actors taking on the SOUND of a Wailing Wall... \nVARIOUS YOUNG HYSTERICAL ACTRESSES ...the height of ego. You think your he-manness can make me get on that elevator even though I'm phobic?... I CAN'T GET ON THAT ELEVATOR. I don't care if... they catch us. DO YOU GET... IT. DO YOU GET IT! I CAN'T! I CAN'T... three, please. \nTHREE HYSTERICAL ACTRESSES \nSINGING the dialogue... \nSINGING ACTRESSES ...can't get on the elevator... can't get on the elevator... even if you make me... even if you make me. Do you get it?... do you get it?... \nTWO ACTRESSES \nStanding near each other--exchange glares as they break each other's concentration and move apart... THEIR MOVEMENT SERVING as our gateway to DANCING... The SONG \"MAKE BELIEVE\" enters fully now and builds in intensity, reaching a repeated phrase, as we move to Matt and he enters the building, thereby cutting off the song. \nON MATT \nAs the SONG continues in intensity, Matt enters the building at the end of a repeated phrase cutting off the song as we move to: \nANGLE ON RECEPTION AREA \nWhere CATHY BRESLOW, age 30, waits. Hollywood is a bit of an uphill struggle for Cathy. She is bright where others are brilliant, pretty where others are gorgeous, enormously hard working where others are obsessive-compulsive. She is clearly waiting for someone while reading an enormously thick book galley. Matt almost scoots by her, then stops. \nMATT Hi... See, I did recognize you. You didn't have to wait for me. \nCATHY Well, I wanted to introduce you. As if knowing me would help. \nINT. POPCORN PICTURES - DAY \nMOVING SHOT. Staircase packed with actors, an uphill slalom almost impossible to navigate. \nCATHY It's a ridiculously awful movie. \nMATT Well, challenge. I wasn't sure you'd remember me... let alone help... \nCATHY Stop. You're good. I'm doing them a favor by getting you in. \nMATT Well, that's a fresh slant. \nThey reach the casting assistant, CLAIRE. \nCATHY Claire, this is Matt Hobbs. \nAs Matt is handed a set of sides, we SHOOT PAST Matt as he watches Cathy move back down the stairs before he can say another word. She moves with wit. He is struck by her. He looks back at Claire, who has an intricate hairdo and a ready smile. \nCLAIRE Hi. Sorry. We're running behind... Please forgive us. \nLONG DISSOLVE TO: \nSAME SHOT - TWO HOURS LATER \nHer hairdo wilted, her blouse soiled, her smile gone, the tendons of her neck prominent. \n", "test2_input": "Cathy going out of sight. \nON MATT \nAs he lets her go. \nINT. BURKE'S HOME - EARLY MORNING \nHe is in bed, wearing a bathrobe, watching projection TV. \nFIRST VOICE ...number seven at the box office this week-end is... \nHe switches channels. \nVOICE NUMBER TWO ...the two words are Tom Cruise. \nHe switches channels. \nTHIRD VOICE ...becoming the first lawyer to be awarded his own star on Hollywood Boule... \nHe turns off the TV and crosses to the phone, allowing us to read the back of his bathrobe \"ROCKY BALBOA.\" \nANGLE ON BURKE \nHe looks at the clock which reads \"four a.m.\" and dials. \nBURKE Hello, Nan. I hope it's not too late to call. \nINT. NAN'S KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING \nShe has been crying. \nBURKE I'd like another chance. \nNAN You only think you feel that way because you're on the verge of failure and you're without a core... \nBURKE See. Nobody else gets me. (a beat then) You wanna have a little sex, honey? \nNAN (a beat then) You know I've never hung up on anybody in my life... because what if the next thing they said solved everything... but I must end this conversation. \nNan hangs up. Burke picks up a pocket electronic notepad from the bedstand and hits the scroll button. \nINSERT ELECTRONIC NOTEBOOK \nNames and phone numbers. \nON BURKE \nHe scrolls past numbers, considering, finding them wanting, so that, finally, he is scrolling the emptiness of his relationships. Now he considers one number and dials. \nINT. MATT'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING \nThe phone rings. He picks it up. \nMATT Hello. \nINTERCUT BETWEEN THE TWO \nBURKE Hi, Matt, this is Burke. I'm sorry to bother you at home, but you know Nan... We were going out a little and I could use another guy's slant on what's just happened. \nMATT I don't think I can get into this... \nBURKE Why? Did I catch you at a bad time? \nMATT Worse. You caught me at a bad time you caused. \nBURKE Oh, you mean about the screentest. The whole room thought you did good work. \nMATT (reinventing irony) Thanks. \nBURKE Yeah, look, I'm not going to bother you about my thing. \nMATT Yeah. Okay, good night. \nINT. BURKE'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING \nAs he hangs up. Looks down and turns off his phone number pocket computer. MUSIC RECALLS Prince's \"There is Lonely.\" \nEXT. TV STUDIO - LATE AFTERNOON \nMUSIC SEGUES to recall \"I'LL DO ANYTHING,\" as he drives past the line waiting to see RAINBOW HOUSE. \n(NOTE: FROM THIS POINT ON, THERE WILL BE AN UNDERCURRENT OF CHOREOGRAPHY TO CONCLUSION...) \n", "test2_true": "We see Jeannie's face in the mirror, but it is seen through something resembling fleece, which we now recognize as the strands of Jeannie's hair being combed out to the side by an expert hair-dresser. Jeannie is shifting nervously in the large room where each chair is filled with a child of a different age and color. In the b.g., we can HEAR the voice of the WARM-UP MAN. \nWARM-UP MAN ...pilot for a new show called 'Rainbow House'. Just listen to our band and I'll be back to tell you more and make you love me... \nThe audience laughs thinly. The BAND PLAYS as someone closes the door to the make-up room muffling the offstage sound... There is a good deal of tension in the brightly lit room. Jeannie sits between a FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD HISPANIC BOY and a FOUR-YEAR-OLD ASIAN GIRL. The room is abuzz... kids running lines and loudly talking... this builds to a musical life as in our first audition scene... there is a briefly sung phrase (Jeannie not taking part). \nINT. GREEN ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON \nThe parents, in the same variety of skin colors as the child actors, are stuffed into a small room being patronized by the ASSISTANT DIRECTOR. Matt is grimly seated in the middle of a long sofa containing stage mothers. Another sofa is two feet away; the parents strain at each other. The A.D. is talking grandly but we cannot hear his words because the Rainbow Parents are SINGING a phrase from the same song we heard in the make-up room. Matt does not take part in the singing. The music goes under allowing us to now hear the A.D.'s words. \nA.D. ...and when you're in the audience, make sure you laugh and applaud even when it's somebody else's kid... \nThere is appreciative laughter from everyone save Matt, who rises in disgust and crosses out of the room. \nA.D. (again) You're not allowed near the stage. We only have a few minutes... \nMatt ignores him and exits. \nINT. BACKSTAGE AREA - LATE AFTERNOON \nMUSIC NOW EMPHASIZING THE TENSION OF THE PRE-SHOW ATMOSPHERE. Matt, moving about the area, looking for Jeannie, spots a cluster of other cast members excitedly awaiting their introduction. Jeannie not among them. An A.D. talks with concern to a P.A. \nA.D. Let me know if you see the little white girl. \nMatt, growing concerned, walks on, then: \nMATT'S POV \nAcross the stage to the distant make-up room. Jeannie, alone in the room, which is so brightly lit it creates a bizarre effect, as if she were under a surreal spotlight. MUSIC reprises Jeannie's Sinead O'Connor song, \"Lonely Life of Mine.\" \nON MATT \nStopping his impulse to go to her--he continues to observe. \nMATT'S POV \nJeannie is nervous and uncertain... She plays with the handle of the make-up chair... turns herself back and forth... Then a very attractive TEN-YEAR-OLD BOY enters the scene--obviously telling her to hustle... He offers his hand and she takes it, instinctively masking all clues that this hand holding is a \"first\" of great moment in her life. As they move toward the main stage area, Jeannie looks around, needing something... her dad. \nMATT Jeannie. \nShe turns--sees her father and gives a small, cursory nod... He moves quickly, drawing even with her but still giving her a bit of space and a low-key pep talk. \nMATT Just remember. You're not even here tonight. There's only this other little girl that you're pretending to be who lives at Rainbow House. \nJEANNIE ...and who just vomited. \nMatt breaks up. Even Jeannie smiles briefly, then she takes him aside for privacy. \nJEANNIE I just found out that we bow before we even do anything. \nMATT Great. \nJEANNIE And everybody claps. \nMATT Great. \nJEANNIE I made up a great bow. You going to look? \nMATT Wouldn't miss it. \nJEANNIE I'm not going to be able to cry. It's too hard for me. \nMATT Hey, then they'll just give you more chances after everyone leaves. \nThis does not satisfy her. She rolls her eyes as she is pulled away towards the front of the stage. Matt watches as the 10- year-old veteran actor leads his little daughter towards her debut. \nINT. BACKSTAGE - LATE AFTERNOON - MOVING SHOT - BURKE \nMUSIC, a tension-filled version of \"Poor Bastard.\" Burke's stride was never stronger, his posture never worse; head hunched down into his neck. Suddenly, he reacts as he sees: the staff of Popcorn Pictures grouped together backstage. Cathy walking towards the group hurriedly from one direction as Burke approaches from the other. Seeing his staff has clearly moved Burke. \nBURKE Look at you. You're all here because of what's on the line for me tonight. Having this many people in your corner helps more than I would have ever guessed. I'm just very grateful that I made you come. \nHe starts off, but a jubilant Cathy stops him, whispers something. He reacts with excitement. \nMOVING WITH CATHY \nShe sees Matt deep in the wings watching the stage. She calls to him with some urgency. \nCATHY Matt. Matt. Matt. \nHe turns and she beckons him towards her. With some hesitance, he joins her. \nMATT I don't want to miss her introduction. \n", "test3_input": "MATT (a beat, then) Give me a kiss. \nShe does. \nINT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT \nThe cast of Rainbow House taking off their make-up, changing clothes, etc. This is more than high energy and excitement-- what's the opposite of trauma? All are off the wall with pleasure--the MUSICAL LIFE of the earlier dressing room scene returning--peaks of glee resulting in sung phrases as before. Jeannie enters and is immediately surrounded with love, attention and ad-libbed compliments about her work. In this glare of good will, Jeannie turns gloriously shy. \nBLACK LEAD ACTRESS Do you have any idea how special you were? (on Jeannie's goony reaction) That looks like a 'yes.' You've got to get dressed for the party. \nJEANNIE (overwhelmed) There's more? (then) What will I wear? \nBLACK LEAD ACTRESS Go to wardrobe; they'll give you anything you want. \nON JEANNIE \nShe moves to her dressing table--sits, looks in the mirror and giggles uncontrollably. \nINT. BACKSTAGE AREA - NIGHT \nMatt stands waiting for Jeannie. Nan approaches. \nNAN It didn't sell. \nMATT This show didn't sell?!? How do you know so fast? \nNAN It's the first time they had me do cards for a pilot and the demographics are all wrong for after nine o'clock. That's their only opening. \nJeannie exits the make-up room aglow. She is wearing an incredibly stylish outfit and her hair is in an expertly done intricate braid. \nNAN Hi. I'm Nan. I'm a good friend of your Dad's. \nJEANNIE Hello, Nan. I'm Jeannie. Did you see it? \nNAN (to Jeannie) Yes, and you were wonderful. (aside to Matt) 89 percent likeability. (to Jeannie) And knowing that you were that good means so much more than the show not going. \nJEANNIE What? \nNAN Oh, no. (to Matt) I couldn't help it. \nJEANNIE What does she mean? (to Nan) What do you mean? (to Matt) What does she mean? (to Nan) What do you mean? \nMATT That they're not going to be doing any more of these shows right now-- but... \nJEANNIE (struck) Oh, my God. \nMATT Honey... \nJEANNIE And that means they're not going to have a party? \nMATT No. They're still having the party. \nJEANNIE (totally relieved) Oh... really?... good... can we stay late? \nTo which Matt answers: \nMATT Honey, we're going to close the place. \nEXT. ROOF GARDEN - NIGHT \nThe door to the roof garden opens and Jeannie enters--her dad behind her as she sees the party... the sparkling lights, the decorations, the other kids and MUSIC... our opening song... \"WOW\". \nON JEANNIE \nAs her father urges her into the flow. She passes Millie, who is dancing with the boy who held Jeannie's hand. \nMILLIE I cast him so he has to dance with me, but I'm sure he'd prefer dancing with you. \nBOY (to Jeannie) Come on. You know how? \nJEANNIE (angrily, with disdain) Yesssssss. \nThey begin to dance with the others. MUSIC SLOWS IN TEMPO as we indicate TIME PASSAGE and: \nANGLE ON BURKE AND MATT \nPerched on a ledge eyeing the party. \nBURKE I'm not comfortable with television anyway... it's too small... I'm much better at something with size... I don't do itzy. Even this movie of Cathy's--it's small... medium small. But with Stone it takes on a certain volume where I start to feel comfortable. (out of nowhere) I hate my life... (backtracking) ...in a way. I had a drink in my office. I'm confused. You're not saying anything. Is it because you're not listening or because I haven't stopped talking? \nMATT This Oliver Stone thing... does he really want me? \nBURKE Yeah. Oh, yeah. I forgot to say congratu... \n", "test3_true": "BURKE Which one you want? \nMATT One of the two leads wouldn't be bad. \nBURKE No. It's the crippled factory owner. \nMATT Best part in the movie. \nHe gets off the ledge and starts to move away... Burke moves quickly to cut him off. \nBURKE Wait a second. \nMATT I want to see my kid. \nBURKE A second--look, they're taking the cast picture now anyway. \nTHEIR POV \nJeannie, working her way to the absolute middle of the cast picture, where she plops on someone's lap. \nBACK TO SCENE \nBURKE She doesn't look anything like the women I usually go with. And you know what they say, \"beauty fades.\" What they don't say is that it fades very slowly. \nMATT You don't think I can tell you what to do? \nBURKE No. Only I can do that. I want you to tell me what to feel... (he begins to use his fingers to run down Nan's qualities) Look. I trust her. More important, everyone does. You have no idea how impressed people are with her. She's smart. She's interesting. You never know what she'll say next... Her work is amazing. I like talking to her. You have no idea what to expect next. I respect what she does more than any writer or director--sincerely-- much more unusual--much more important. So? \nMATT Good luck. \nHe walks away. Burke waves a grateful goodbye and looks around the room until he sees: \nBURKE'S POV - NAN ACROSS THE ROOF \nNan eating cake with her hands. She sees him. He indicates he would like to dance. She does not move a muscle in response... Still, he walks towards her. She begins to shake her head, \"no.\" He shifts uncomfortably, but keeps coming until he reaches her side. \nON NAN AND BURKE \nBURKE Dance with me. (she shakes her head) On a business basis. \nNAN No. (he turns away, dejected) But I'll dance with you because I think it will reassure me that I should have nothing to do with you. \nBURKE I'll take it. \nAs they dance. \nNAN Why are you breathing so heavy? \nBURKE Nervous... Look, let's move our thing in a more regular direction. \nNAN What do you mean? \nBURKE Let me think. (then) What if we go out this weekend... (before she can say \"no\") ...with your kid. \nSeveral more beats of dancing--as he awaits her answer. \nNAN ...whose name is? \nBURKE Whose name is... (then, triumphantly) Leslie. \nNAN Okay. \nSONG BACK--\"WOW\"... sung as a chorus... a slower cadence for the romance as we... CHANGE MUSIC and they dance more closely. The song slows for time passage and MUSIC CHANGES to \"BE MY MIRROR\" as we... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. DESERTED POPCORN PICTURES ROOM - ONE HOUR LATER \nMatt and Jeannie--the last ones there. He holds her in his arms, dancing. She is asleep. He dances her to a chair with her wrap on it... shifts her around, wrestling to get it on. She wakes up and puts it on herself. \nJEANNIE (looking around satisfied) Last ones here. \nMATT Well, I told you. \nHe takes her hand and starts to lead her towards the stair shed--then: \nMATT I never got to see your bow. \nShe looks up, smiling pridefully, to see her father smiling back pridefully. \nJEANNIE (as if it's a great sacrifice) Oh, all right. \nShe bows. It is a bow all her own. \n"}

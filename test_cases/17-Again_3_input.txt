INT. TRENDY HAIR SALON - NIGHT 
A picture of a YOUNG, POPULAR STAR torn from one of the teen mags hangs on the mirror. 
A HAIRDRESSER cuts away and highlights Mike's long locks.     Ed sits beside Mike sipping wine, enjoying a manicure. 
INT. TRENDY CLOTHES STORE - NIGHT 
It's the PRETTY WOMAN scene. 2 hip SALESGIRLS pull clothes from racks. A clean cut Mike tries on sneakers, jeans, T- shirts, hoodies, shirts, jewelry. Ed nods with his approval or disapproval. 
At the register, the Girls hand Mike his bags of clothes.     Ed takes out his cell to put their numbers in it. The Girls frown and go back to work. 
INT. VIRGIN MEGA MUSIC STORE - NIGHT 
Mike and Ed stand before the wall of 100 top albums.   Both wear headphones listening and moving to the music. 
INT. ED'S HOUSE/OFFICE - NIGHT 
Mike and Ed, surrounded by the magazines and music discs, sit before the computer. Ed TEACHES Mike how to create a MYSPACE page. 
Bogus About Me and Interests. Photoshopped pictures of Mike in exotic locations. All the `now' movies, music and books. They fill his Friends section with only hot girls. 
The Boys view the flashy, finished product, tap fists.   This page makes `Mark Freedman' look like a playboy. 
INT. MAC STORE - NIGHT 
A SALESMAN hands a smiling Mike his new iPhone. 
INT. ED'S HOUSE/MIKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Mike sits on the bed, types away on his laptop. A knock on the door. Mike looks up and YELLS. Ed stands in the doorway, his entire body and head wrapped in SEAWEED. 
ED Before you ask, it's a seaweed wrap. I'm detoxifying as well as losing an inch or 2 from my problem areas. 
MIKE There must be a very hot girl downstairs. 
ED There is.    What are you doing? 
MIKE I forwarded my calls to my new phone, sent some work emails and just lobbed one to Scarlet, told her I was in Peru finding myself. Think she'll buy it? 
ED Probably not because when she called earlier I told her you were being detained at Guantanamo. Ready for tomorrow? 
MIKE I am so ready. 
Ed flips Mike a set of keys.     Mike's eyes light up. 
ED That ought'a put you over the top. And don't forget to hook me up son. 
Ed plods off.   Off Mike's huge smile. 
EXT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/PARKING LOT - MORNING 
The usual pre-school ritual. Stan, Jazz, Kevin, the Wonder Bras and Maggie all hang around Stan's `stang. 
Stan and Maggie wrapped in a heated embrace, kissing. 
HONK.   A horn blares.    Stan and Maggie jump out of the way. 
An ASTON MARTIN VANQUISH stops next to the crew. The tinted window rolls down revealing the new and improved Mike. 
Mike winks then rolls on past. 
SAMANTHA Oh my god.     Was that- 
JAMIE Did you see- 
LAUREN I told you he was cute. 
INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/HALL - DAY 
It's the MOMENT.   Mike walks the hallway, handsome and hip.

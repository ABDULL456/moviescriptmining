EEP No. He was nice. 
GRUG What!? Excuse me? He? 
EEP Oh. Well, I thought he was a warthog, but then he turned into a boy. 
GRAN Strange. Usually it's the reverse. 
Grug RAISES an eyebrow. 
THUNK Eep's got a boy hog! Eep's got a boy hog! 
Eep ELBOWS Thunk in the back of his head. 
EEP There was a boy. Watch, okay. I'm gonna call him. 
Eep pulls out the SHELL. She BLOWS into the shell - the sound ALARMS the Croods. 
They SMACK the shell from Eep's hand and SMASH it with their rocks. 
Eep is incredulous. The dust clears - the panting Croods are satisfied the object is gone. EEP (CONT'D) What is wrong with you? 
GRUG It was dangerous. 
EEP (VERY ANGRY) It was beautiful. You want to see dangerous? Here. 
She pelts Thunk with a rock. 
THUNK Owww! My sniffer! 
GRUG Okay Eep, that's it. We're going back to the cave and you're going to stay in there until you're older than... her! 
EEP What!? You can't keep me inside forever! 
Eep throws a tantrum of epic proportion. She SLAMS a rock on the ground. It SHATTERS to dust. 
CREAK! A strange GROAN is heard from under the ground. Then a small amount of sand falls from up above. A crack starts to splinter under their feet. 
EEP (CONT'D) He said this would happen. 
Then BOOM! The ground starts to SHAKE! 
GRUG Get to the cave! GO! 
The Croods RACE through the CANYON NARROWS, fighting their way through falling boulders and shifting ground, heading towards the safety of their cave. 
The Croods see the cave entrance. The canyon walls above their home start to crack. Grug sees that the falling rock will crush the cave. 
GRUG (CONT'D) Look out! Stop! 
Grug leaps and tackles his family, protecting them from the mass of rocks crashing down. The top of the canyon collapses and the Crood's cave is destroyed. Everything is engulfed by dust. The earth settles. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
SEQ. 710 - CROSSING OVER 
The dust clears a bit - the Croods are in a tight ball, covered by Grug. Grug stands, all Croods were sheltered and safe under his mighty arms. 
GRUG (CONT'D) Is everyone okay? 
UGGA Yes. Grug, the cave, it's gone. 
Grug looks back to Crood cave. It is gone. 
GRUG No. 
Grug searches the rubble for any sign that the cave might still be there. He finds one handprint, split in two. 
He carefully fits them back together. Emotional, he lowers his head. 
As Eep steps forward, a shaft of light filtering through the dusty veil from the wreckage crosses her face--

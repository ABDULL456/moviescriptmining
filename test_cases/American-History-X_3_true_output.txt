Seth takes a bite and chews. 
SETH Derek's a fuckin' traitor pussy. 
CAMMERON Well...we might be pussies too if we got treated the way he did. 
SETH What do you mean? 
CAMMERON Stevie McCormick called...old school Venice bro. He's at Chino...doin' life. He hated Derek. (exhaling) Said he was a fucking blow-up doll in there. 
SETH (overwhelmed) Fucking A. 
Seth continues to eat.  Cammeron looks out the window and hates what he sees. 
CAMMERON Oh Christ. You gotta be kidding me? 
SETH 
What? 
CAMMERON'S POV. A large, mature and sharp-looking BLACK MAN helps A BEAUTIFUL BLOND out of a RED BMW. THEY KISS. Cammeron is at a loss for words. Cam puts out his cigarette as the couple ENTERS. 
CAMMERON (looking at the two) Is there anything sacred in this country anymore? Jesus Christ. Hey. Stop feeding your face for a second and look behind you. 
Seth turns his head and stares at the interracial couple. He turns back to Cam and sings a verse from the famous atevie Wonder song, EBONY AND IVORY. Cameron laughs. The black man turns and looks at the two. 
CAMMERON Can we help you with something? Do you have any questions about the menu? 
BLACK MAN No questions. 
CAMMERON I recommend either the "Big Ben Burger" or the "Chicken Taco Special." Ben'll replace the dark meat with the white meat if you ask nicely. 
BLACK MAN (fed up) What's your problem, pal? 
CAMMERON I ain't your fucking pal first of all. Secondly...I don't have problems. People who luck with me have problems. 
WHITE GIRL Come on. Let's get out of here. 
CAMMERON Hey! What a great idea! You got a clever little whatever it is there. I'd listen to it if I were you. 
BLACK MAN You're not me. 
CAMHERON (smiling) And I thank God Almighty every day for that, believe me. 
SETH Excuse me? Tyrone? 
BLACK MAN My name's not Tyrone either. 
SETH Whatever.  Why can't you stick to your own race? 
WHITE GIRL (disgusted) Jesus Christ! Where do you assholes come from?! 
CAMMERON What the luck difference does it make where we come from, bitch? I'm from a place called America. A place that used to be a nice place to live before it became fuckin' Africa-America. 
BLACK MAN You ignorant mother-- 
Seth quickly gets out of his chair and makes his gun totally visible to the couple. 
SETH You got a fuckin' death wish, asshole? Do you? Make your move now if you do. If you don't...get the luck out of my sight. Cause I'm real close to shoving my piece up your girlfriend's stinky pussy. 
The black man stares at the gun sticking out of Seth's belly. He grabs his girlfriend and walks out of the joint. Seth sits back down and the two laugh. Cameron looks over at Ben and raises his hands in the air. 
CAMMERON (smiling) Everything's hunky dory, Ben!  No problemo. Only us white folk. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BEDROOM - A DIGITAL CLOCK 
It reads 2:36 a.m. Shiftless Derek lifts a sleeping Danny off the computer keyboard. He helps him into the bottom bunk, tucks him in, and watches him snooze. 
DEREK (softly) Did you "save" it? 
An asleep Danny nods. Derek slowly walks back into the bathroom to grab his towel off the floor. He looks at his SWASTIKA TAT in the mirror and sighs to himself. He turns off the light and exits. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BURGER JOINT - SETH AND CAMMERON 
Seth finishes his display of gluttony.

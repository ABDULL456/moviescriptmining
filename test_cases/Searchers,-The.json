{"train": "THE SEARCHERS \n\"THE SEARCHERS\" \nRevised Final Screenplay by \nFrank Nugent \nFADE IN \nBehind the main title and the credits: \nEXT. PLAINS COUNTRY - CLOSE SHOT - MOVING JUST ABOVE GROUND LEVEL - A STUDY OF HOOFPRINTS - LATE AFTERNOON \nThe hoofprints are deeply etched in the ground, picking their way through scrubby desert growth. An occasional tumbleweed drifts with the light breeze across the pattern of prints; and lightly-blown soil and sand begin the work of erasing them. The CAMERA FOLLOWING the hoofprints \nRAISES SLOWLY TO: \nEXT. PLAINS COUNTRY - LONG SHOT - LATE AFTERNOON \nWe see the rider now. BACK TO CAMERA, jogging slowly along -- heading down a long valley toward a still-distant ranch house with its outlying barn and corrals. \nEXT. PLAINS COUNTRY - MED. SHOT - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON \nThe CAMERA FRAMES and MOVES with the lone horseman. He is ETHAN EDWARDS, a man as hard as the country he is crossing. \nEthan is in his forties, with a three-day stubble of beard. \nDust is caked in the lines of his face and powders his clothing. He wears a long Confederate overcoat, torn at one pocket, patched and clumsily stitched at the elbows. \nHis trousers are a faded blue with an off-color stripe down the legs where once there had been the yellow stripes of the Yankee cavalry. His saddle is Mexican and across it he carries a folded serape in place of the Texas poncho... \nRider and horse have come a long way. The CAMERA HOLDS and PANS the rider past and we see another detail; strapped onto his saddle roll is a sabre and scabbard with a gray silk sash wrapped around it... Horse and rider pass, moving closer to the ranch as a little girl and a small dog come tearing around the corner of the house. \nEXT. THE YARD OF THE EDWARDS RANCH - MED. SHOT - DEBBIE - LATE AFTERNOON \nShe is staring wide-eyed at the distant horseman o.s. \nHer little dog has seen him too and is barking excitedly. \nDEBBIE quickly reaches to grab the dog by the scruff of the neck, crouching over him. Debbie is 11 years old with a piquant, memorable face. \nEXT. THE YARD - CLOSE SHOT - DEBBIE \nHere we must establish and dramatize what it is about her face that is memorable, so that if we were to see her again five or six years later, we would know it is she -- perhaps the eye color or the slant of eyebrow, or a trick of scratching bridge of nose with crooked forefinger. \nEXT. THE EDWARDS HOUSE - MED. SHOT - AARON - LATE AFTERNOON \nThe ranch house is of adobe, solidly built, with a sod and cross-timbered roof, deep windows. A small gallery or porch extends across the front. AARON EDWARDS comes through the door, attracted by the dog's barking -- and then he, too, sees the approaching horseman and comes farther out -- curious but not at all apprehensive. Aaron is a lean, weathered and tired man, with a down-swept mustache; a gentler-looking man than Ethan and possibly a few years older. \nAs he squints off, studying the rider, his older daughter, LUCY, comes out to stand behind him. Lucy is from 16 to 18 -- a pleasant, feminine girl. She is carrying a mixing bowl with some sort of batter in it, which she now completely forgets to whip in her interest in the approaching stranger. \nIn the next instant MARTHA EDWARDS follows the daughter onto the porch. Martha is a still-lovely woman, although the years have etched fine wrinkles about her eyes and mouth, and work has worn and coarsened her hands. Those hands will never be idle when Martha is on scene... And now, while she shares the family's interest in the approaching horseman, she automatically notes that Lucy has forgotten her task -- and she takes the mixing bowl from her and stirs the batter. \nEXT. YARD OF THE EDWARDS HOUSE - FULL SHOT - LATE AFTERNOON \nAlong the side of the house comes BEN EDWARDS, 14, with a man-sized armload of chunkwood clutched to his chest. He, too, has spotted the stranger and is all attention. So much so that he trips, but recovers his footing. He pauses to dump the wood into a woodbox by the door -- his eyes always riveted on the oncoming rider -- and then he moves toward the others, biting a splinter out of a finger. Beyond Ben, MARTIN PAULEY emerges from the barn and crosses the open ground heading toward CAMERA. Martin is somewhat under 20, a lithe, perfectly coordinated male animal, with Indian-straight hair and a white man's eyes. He is carrying bridle or other horse-gear. He looks to the family on the porch -- to see if they recognize the stranger -- then out again. He continues, followed by Ben, toward where \nDebbie crouches over her dog. \nEXT. PLAINS COUNTRY - LONG SHOT - ETHAN - LATE AFTERNOON \nAs he rides downslope toward the house. \nTHE CREDITS END. \nEXT. THE EDWARDS RANCH - MED. CLOSE SHOT - MARTHA, LUCY, AND AARON - LATE AFTERNOON \nSuddenly, Martha's eyes widen as she -- even before Aaron -- recognizes the distant rider. Her hand goes to her mouth to check the name that trembles on her lips... An instant later Aaron, too, identifies the oncoming horseman. \nAARON (incredulous) Ethan? \nHe looks at her, frowning, then slowly steps out onto the hard ground. Martha hands the bowl back to Lucy and follows Aaron. \nEXT. THE YARD OF THE EDWARDS HOUSE - FULL SHOT - THE GROUP \nas Ethan rides in and sits his horse, looking down at them. There is a noticeable constraint on all of them. Finally: \nETHAN Hello, Aaron... \nHis eyes shift to Martha and hold. Ethan is, and always has been, in love with his brother's wife and she with him. \nETHAN Martha... \nMARTHA (a bit shakily) Hello, Ethan. \nEthan slowly, stiffly swings out of the saddle. Aaron and Martha exchange quick glances... troubled, puzzled. Aaron pastes on an uncertain smile as Ethan comes around his horse toward their side. \nAARON How's California? \nETHAN How should I know? \nAARON But Mose Harper said... \nETHAN That old goat still creakin' around?... Whyn't someone bury him? \nHe goes to his saddle pack, begins unlacing it. Ben and Debbie have inched closer -- half-shy, half-curious. \nDebbie's dog begins sniffing at his heels. Ethan looks down at them - not unfriendly, just a man not used to children. \nETHAN Ben, ain't you? \nBEN Will you tell me tomorrow about the war? \nAARON The war ended three years ago, boy! \nBEN It did?... Then whyn't you come home before now? \nMARTHA BEN!... Go 'long with Martin. MARCH! \nAs Ben reluctantly heads out with Martin, Deborah crosses to Ethan's side and studies him gravely. \nDEBBIE Lucy's wearing the gold locket you gave her when she was a little girl... \nETHAN Oh? \nDEBBIE She don't wear it much account of it makes her neck green. \nLUCY (aghast) Deborah! \nDEBBIE (defensively) Well, it does... But I wouldn't care if you gave me a gold locket if it made my neck green or not. \nEthan looks at her gravely. \nETHAN 'Fraid I... (then he remembers something, rises) Wait. \nHe crosses to where his pack is -- a side table or something -- and burrows into it. Debbie is at his side. \nETHAN How about this? \nIt is a gold medal or medallion -- something appropriate to Maximilian of Mexico -- suspended by a long multi-colored satin ribbon. \nDEBBIE Oh! LOOK! My gold locket! \nShe holds it high for mother -- and all -- to see. Martha takes it and reacts at its weight. \nMARTHA It's solid gold... Ethan, I don't think she's old enough... \nETHAN Let her keep it... Just something I picked up in Mexico. \nMartha reluctantly surrenders it to Debbie's eager hand. \nAaron hasn't missed the word \"Mexico\" and looks sharply at Ethan. \nDEBBIE Oh, thank you, Uncle Ethan... \nLUCY (to Debbie) Come along... \nThe two girls leave the main room. Martha and Aaron both look at Ethan -- half expecting some further explanation. \nHe turns from them and looks into the fire. Martha begins to clear the table. Aaron gets up, takes a pipe and a spill -- lights it at the fire. \nETHAN Passed the Todd place comin' in... What happened to 'em? \nAARON They gave up... went back to the cotton rows... So'd the Jamisons... Without Martha, I don't know... She wouldn't let a man quit. \nEthan turns and looks at her -- still busy with her dishes. \nAARON (change of tone) Ethan, I could see it in you before the war... (Ethan looks at him) You wanted to clear out! \nMartha freezes in what she's doing -- listening. \nAARON And you stayed out beyond all need to... WHY? \nEthan can't answer, but he takes it as a challenge and almost welcomes it. \nETHAN (hard) You askin' me to clear out now? \nAARON (straightening -- with grave dignity) You're my brother... You're welcome to stay as long as you got a mind to... Ain't that so, Martha? \nMARTHA (almost a whisper) Of course he is. \nETHAN I expect to pay my own way... \nMartha resumes her activity. Ethan crosses to his pack, reaches into it for a leather pouch, brings it back and tosses it onto the table. It lands with a resonant clink. \nBoth Martha and Aaron draw close to the table. \n(NOTE TO WINTON HOCH: This scene should be dramatically back- lighted.) \nETHAN There's sixty double eagles in there... twelve-hundred dollars. \nHe opens a waistline shirt button and hauls out a leather money belt and drops that on the table. \nETHAN An' twice that in here. \nHe reaches into the belt and takes out a few mint-fresh gold pieces which he slides across the table. \nETHAN ...only these got the late Emperor Maximilian's picture on 'em. \nMartha picks up one of the gold pieces, staring at the face on the coin: the same as that on the medal -- staring sharply then at Ethan. Aaron is examining another coin with a different interest. \nAARON Mint fresh... not a mark on 'em. \nHe glances questioningly at Ethan. \nETHAN So? \nAaron shrugs and crosses to a barrel chair. He raises the seat and lifts out a pair of old boots, some rags of clothing and then raises a false-bottom lid and drops pouch and money belt into it. Carefully he replaces everything. During this Ethan's attention has gone to Martha's hand, to one cut finger, its wound barely healed. He takes the hand -- gently. \nETHAN Cut yourself? \nShe nods and withdraws the hand. \nMartin ranges himself next to Aaron and both face Clayton. \nCLAYTON Raise your right hands. \nMartha sets out cups on the table, begins pouring the coffee. \nDuring the swearing-in, Ethan will enter the room from the inner door -- unnoticed by the other men, but not by Martha. \nAnd as the scene plays, the audience must always be conscious of the by-play of glances between Martha and Ethan as they face the prospect of being left in this house together. \nCLAYTON You are hereby volunteer privates in Company A of the Texas Rangers and will faithfully discharge the duties of same without recompense or monetary compensation -- meaning no pay!... Amen and get your shirt on, will you, Aaron. \nAARON (stubbornly) Ain't goin' volunteerin' after rustlers without my morning coffee, Reverend... Drink your own! \nCLAYTON (sternly -- as he reaches for his cup) From now on, call me 'Captain'! \nBut Ethan advances and calmly appropriates the cup Clayton is reaching for... \nETHAN (mockingly) Captain the Reverend Samuel Johnson Clayton!... Mighty impressive. \nClayton marks his surprise. \nCLAYTON (dourly) Well... the prodigal brother... When'd you get back? \nEthan sips his coffee and doesn't answer. \nCLAYTON Haven't seen you since the surrender. (a pause) Come to think of it, I didn't see you at the surrender. \nETHAN I don't believe in surrenderin'... I still got my sabre, Reverend... never turned it into any ploughshare neither! \nJORGENSEN Is no time for kaffee-klatch while a man's beef is been run off. \nMOSE Injuns, Ethan... (taps his nose) Caddoes or Kiowas... Mose Harper, drinkin' coffee in a rockin' chair. ...ay-eh! \nMartha has left the room briefly to fetch Aaron's shirt and vest and stands behind him. Aaron drains his cup. \nAARON Ethan, countin' on you to look after things while I'm gone. \nEthan -- cup to his lips -- looks over its rim at Martha as Aaron starts to put on his shirt. Their eyes meet briefly, then she looks away. Ethan sloshes the dregs of his cup into the fire -- some of it spattering Mose. \nETHAN You ain't goin'... \nCLAYTON He sure is goin'... He's sworn in. \nETHAN (angrily) Well, swear him out again!... I'll go with you. \nMartha stands submissively, with her head bent, eyes averted as Ethan crosses the room to get his coat, guns, etc. Aaron follows him. \nAARON Now, Ethan, I ain't sure... \nETHAN Don't argue!... And stay close... Maybe they're rustlers... and maybe this dodderin' old idiot ain't so far wrong... \nMOSE Thankin' ye, Ethan... thankin' ye. Kind words... \nCLAYTON (grudgingly) All right... I'll swear you in... \nETHAN You can forget that... (as Sam stares) Wouldn't be legal anyway. \nCLAYTON Why? (a pause -- then shrewdly) You wanted for a crime, Ethan? \nMartha waits -- intent. \nETHAN You askin' as a Reverend or a Captain, Sam? \nCLAYTON I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas. \nETHAN Got a warrant? \nCLAYTON You fit a lot of descriptions. \nETHAN (levelly) I figger a man's only good for one oath at a time... I took mine to the Confederate States of America... (he pauses -- then) So did you, Reverend... \nHe looks past him then -- at Martha and then at Aaron. \nETHAN Stick close, Aaron... \nHe looks at Martha again... and then strides out. \nEXT. THE EDWARDS' HOUSE -- DAWN LIGHT \nAs Ethan emerges he is brought to a momentary halt by sight of a couple -- Brad and Lucy -- in each other's arms, standing near the saddled horses of the posse. Clayton and Jorgensen following him out, spot the couple, who now belatedly are conscious of their audience. \nJORGENSEN Brad!... Is no time for lolly- gagging... \nIn confusion, Lucy runs back around the side of the house as Brad -- unrepentant -- grins at his irascible old man and heads for his waiting horse. Clayton chuckles and turns toward Martha, who has followed them out. \nCLAYTON Looks like I'll be reading the lines over that pair before long, sister Edwards. \nJORGENSEN Is no time for talking weddings... Better say prayers for those dirty thieves, by golly... running off a man's beef... \nMose, last to emerge, bows elaborately to Martha. \nMOSE Grateful to the hospitality of yore rockin' chair, ma'am... \nThe men are mounting. Mose nimbly vaults onto the back of his horse -- which he rides bareback, with only a blanket pad. \nAND \nOMITTED \nEXT. THE EDWARDS' HOUSE -- DAWN LIGHT \nJORGENSEN Mama!... Oh please... please no... BRAD! \nAnd with that one word, Jorgensen calls upon his son to follow and they take off... fast. Ed Nesby and Charlie MacCorry follow. Sam Clayton pauses. \nCLAYTON Jorgensen's place is closest... If they're not there, we'll come straight on! \nThen he too rides. Martin swings his horse back to where Ethan and Mose still are standing. \nMARTIN Well, come on! \nETHAN Easy! (he starts toward his horse) It's forty miles, sonny... Horses can do with some grain and a little rest. \nMOSE Comanch generally hits at moonrise. \nMARTIN Moonrise!... It'll be midnight before... I ain't waitin'...! \nHe wheels his horse and goes tearing to catch up with the others. Ethan shrugs and stoically takes grain bag to feed his horse. Mose does the same. \nMOSE Wisht it was Caddoes... or Kiowas... (shakes his head) Comanche... \nEthan just gives him an angry look and then ruthlessly begins discarding every bit of unnecessary equipment from his saddle. \nWIPE TO: \nEXT. THE EDWARDS RANCH - WIDE ANGLE - SUNDOWN \nNothing moves. Nothing could be more tranquil. The shadows are long. A thin wisp of smoke rises from the chimney. And then Debbie's little dog trots around the side of the house out into the yard. \nEXT. EDWARDS YARD - CLOSE SHOT - THE DOG - SUNDOWN \nHe comes to a standstill and his nose is working. He begins to make excited little sounds deep in his belly. \nThen he lies down, muzzle between his paws, watching, listening. \nINT. THE EDWARDS HOUSE - FULL SHOT - ANGLING TOWARD \nTHE DOOR \nDebbie sits on the floor, playing with a little rag doll. \nThe slanting blaze of the setting sun makes a brilliant area of light in which she is sitting. Beyond her, on the porch steps, Ben is squatting, whittling a piece of pine into a slingshot frame. We hear Martha and Lucy busy with the dishes. Aaron comes from behind CAMERA and stands in the doorway, absently rapping out his pipe. Near the doorway, on a wooden peg, hangs his gun, belt. He puts the pipe in his pocket and glances down at Deborah, intent on her play. He looks swiftly at where the women are busy - then stealthily eases the gun from its holster and slides it under his shirt. He hasn't made a sound and is sure he's got away with it. \nHe clears his throat noisily and reaches for a light shotgun pegged above the door. \nAARON Think I'll see if I can pick off a sage-hen or two, Martha... \nINT. THE EDWARDS HOUSE - MED. CLOSE SHOT - MARTHA AND LUCY \nbusy at the wooden sink. Martha doesn't turn. \nMARTHA You do that, Aaron... \nAARON (still pleased with himself) Won't go far... \nHe steps out. Only then does Martha turn -- and her \nEYES GO AT ONCE TO: \nINT. THE EDWARDS HOUSE - ANGLING TO DOOR \nand FRAMING the empty holster, as Aaron pauses on the porch. \nLUCY'S VOICE My, the days are getting shorter! \nINT. EDWARDS HOUSE - CLOSE SHOT - MARTHA AND LUCY \nas Lucy heads for the lamp. \nMARTHA (sharply) Lucy!... We don't need the lamp yet... \nLucy frowns at her mother. \nMARTHA (easily) Let's enjoy the dusk a while. \nEXT. THE EDWARDS HOUSE - MED. CLOSE SHOT - AARON AND BEN - \nON PORCH Aaron is slowly scanning the terrain. \nAARON (to Ben) Mind you sweep up them shavin's. \nBEN Yes, Pa... (undertone -- man to man) An' if you see any sage-hens, I'm ready. \nAaron stares as the boy shifts a fold of blanket, or whatever, by his side -- to disclose Ethan's cavalry sabre. Aaron smiles and rubs the youngster's head, then sets out across the yard. \nEXT. THE EDWARDS YARD - FULL SHOT - MOVING \nDebbie's dog rises at Aaron's approach and joins his master as they set out across the plain. \nEXT. OPEN COUNTRY NEAR EDWARDS HOME - MED. CLOSE SHOT - \nAARON \nHe is walking through the scrub and brush grass, every sense alive and straining. He pauses every three or four strides -- casting each quadrant in turn. Once he whips, gun ready, as a sage-hen or quail whirrs up not far from him. He smiles grimly as he watches it fly away. He keeps on. \nEXT. THE EDWARDS HOUSE - MED. CLOSE SHOT - AT PORCH \nMartha comes to stand in the doorway. Ben doesn't look at her. His eyes -- like hers -- are fixed on the figure of the man. \nBEN (quietly) It's all right, ma... I been watchin'...  Only I wish... \nMARTHA (quietly) What, Ben? \nDEBBIE Where's she buried? \nMARTHA And you'll go along the ditch -- very quietly -- like a... (her voice breaks) \nDEBBIE Like a little mouse. \nAARON Now! \nHe reaches for the child, but he has to wait for Martha's last embrace. \nMARTHA There!... And you won't come back or make a sound... no matter what you hear? Promise!... No matter what? \nDEBBIE I promise... Wait! \nAARON Child, child! \nDEBBIE Can't I have Topsy to keep me company? \nAARON There's no time... \nMARTHA Here she is, baby... Baby... \nAaron takes the child, swings her out the window. \nAARON Down low -- go! \nMartha would come to the window to look out, but Aaron bars her with an arm and draws back to the side of the window to watch her go... Outside the little dog barks a welcome and presumably starts to follow the girl. Aaron reacts. \nAARON (hoarse whisper) Here dog... here! \nThe dog whines but obeys. Aaron continues watching the child's course -- unconsciously imitating her every run and twist... Then he smiles and we may see the brightness in the corners of his eyes. \nAARON She reached the ditch... \nHe closes the shutters and turns -- and his arms go around Martha, weeping soundlessly. \nAARON She'll be all right, mother... she'll be all right. \nEXT. A HILLOCK WITH TWO HEADBOARDS - MED. CLOSE SHOT - \nNIGHT \nNothing stirs and we hear nothing. Then, with faintest little rustle, Debbie comes snaking along the ground into the hollow between the two graves and lies there face down, pressed against Topsy. She becomes one with the earth and the stillness. And then the moonlight strikes the tips of the scrub growth and as a cloud scuds by, the moonlight reveals something glittering -- like beads. And the CAMERA from that ground-level shot \nRAISES QUICKLY TO: \nCLOSE SHOT - FROM EXTREME LOW ANGLE - SCAR \nThe Comanche we are later to know as SCAR is painted for war -- tall, savage, mockingly looking down at what we know is the child's hiding place... And in that instant, from a dozen quarters and a dozen throats, sounds the wild yammer of the warwhoop! \nDISSOLVE TO: \nOMITTED \nEXT. RISING GROUND - MED. CLOSE SHOT - MARTIN - MOONLIGHT \nHe stands beside his spent and fallen horse. Its breathing is a rasping whistle. Martin tries to haul its head up. \nUseless. Breathing hard himself, his face ashen in the moonlight, Martin looks desperately off in the direction of the ranch. Then he jerks the rifle from its saddle scabbard -- struggling with it because it is under the horse. He freezes then -- listening... And we hear the steady beat of two horsemen approaching. Martin knows who they are and his face is alive with hope. He gets the rifle free at last and goes running toward the oncoming riders. \nMARTIN (shouting) Ethan!... Ethan! \nThe CAMERA SWINGS with him and we see Ethan and Mose approaching at the same steady gait. \nMARTIN (waving) Uncle Ethan... it's me... Martin! \nEthan doesn't slacken, nearly rides him down. \nETHAN Out of my way! \nMartin goes sprawling to his hands and knees. Mose continues without slowing. \nEXT. RISING GROUND - ANOTHER ANGLE - PAST THE RIDERS - MOONLIGHT \nMARTIN (desperately) Mose! Wait!... \nHe goes running, stumbling after the riders -- desperately calling to them... \nMARTIN Ethan!... Mose!... \nAnd then at the crest of the rising ground, he stops -- \nWe see in the distance the glow of a fire leading from the barns and the hayricks and the house of Aaron Edwards. \nMartin runs down the slope. \nEXT. YARD AND APPROACH TO EDWARDS HOUSE - WIDE ANGLE - NIGHT \n(NOTE TO W. HOCH: Here again that use of red is suggested.) \nThe ANGLE is past the porch uprights toward Mose and Ethan as they ride in. Little tongues of fire are licking the edges of the uprights. A few arrows, imbedded in the wood, are burning along their shafts. Beyond are the glowing ashes of the hayricks and the charred, smouldering rails of the corral. \nThere are no bodies in evidence... The red glow of the burning is on the faces of the men as they dismount. \nEthan strides to the porch, knocking away one of the blazing arrows as he heads to the door. He stops there -- and what he sees makes the big shoulders droop, the huge frame slump. \nSlowly then -- and removing his hat -- he goes in. Mose shuffles to the edge of the porch and squats there and rocks back and forth, his face working and crying soundlessly with senile grief. We hear a splintered door crash from its hinges within the room and Ethan's muffled voice calling through the house: \nETHAN (O.S.) Lucy?... Deborah? Lucy? \nHe strides back through the main room and out onto the porch just as Martin comes at a shambling run across the yard. \nMARTIN We'll find them, Mrs. Jorgensen... We'll find them... \nHe swings into his saddle. Laurie impulsively runs to his side, steps onto the toe of his stirruped boot and pulls herself up to his level to kiss him hard and full upon the mouth. \nHe looks at her dully, as though hardly conscious of it. And she is back beside her mother. Martin rides away after the others. \nMRS. JORGENSEN (slowly) I almost hope they don't find them! \nLaurie looks at her mother and understands. \nCUT TO: \n61-A \nEXT. OPEN COUNTRY - THE SEARCHERS - EARLY MORNING LIGHT \nThe SEARCH THEME begins as we see the riders in turn. \nA series of portraits of the men. \nCLOSE SHOT - BRAD AND CHARLIE - riding point, they come to a pause, surveying the terrain ahead. Charlie, with an arm signal, indicates he will take the left. Brad nods and he rides out to the right. \nTHE MAIN BODY OF THE MEN, Clayton passing first, expression resolute, competent... Then Ed Nesby and old Mose, squinting at the ground as they ride, all but sniffing like an old hound dog. \n63A \nMARTIN - Next to last in file. Finally: \n63B \nETHAN - His face a study of relentless purpose. \nWIPE TO: \nOMITTED. \nEXT. OPEN COUNTRY - FULL SHOT - BRAD AND CHARLIE - AFTERNOON \nThe two men are at a cairn of rocks -- their horses nearby. \nIn the near distance, Clayton is leading the men of the search party at a fast clip toward the cairn. Charlie is standing, Brad tearing the rock cairn apart. In Charlie's hands is a Comanche head-dress of polished buffalo horn and feathers. Brad doesn't even look up as the men ride in and dismount, but continues his grim work of uncovering the buried Indian. \nCLAYTON Another one, eh? \nCHARLIE This 'un come a long way 'fore he died. \nCLAYTON Well, that's seven we can score up to your brother, Ethan. \nNESBY I don't like it. \nCLAYTON What don't you like? \nNESBY Injun's on a raid generly hides their dead so you won't know how many they've lost... If they don't care about us knowin', it only spells one thing... they ain't afraid of us followin' -- or of us catchin' up with 'em either. \nETHAN You can back out any time, Nesby. \nNESBY Didn't say that... (angrily indicating Brad) What's he doin' that for... \nCHARLIE He wants to be sure... \nBrad shifts another rock and Looks grimly upon the face (O.S.) of the dead Comanche. Then he spits at it and stands. \nBRAD (grim) Let's get along... \nETHAN (to Brad) Why don't you finish the job? \nWith that he strides to the cairn, whipping a knife out. he crouches over the body (O.S.) concealing what he is doing, he bends to his bloody task. \nSam Clayton crosses to stand behind him. \nCLAYTON (gravely) What good does that do? \nETHAN By what you preach... none! \nHe stands now and he faces Sam. \nETHAN But by what the Comanche believe -- now he can't enter the spirit land, but has got to wander forever between the winds... because I took his mangy scalp! \nHe flings the scalp down and grinds it into the dirt with his heel... He wipes clean the blade of his knife as he crosses back to his horse. The men mount (those who have dismounted) and they ride off. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nOMITTED \nEXT. NIGHT CAMP - RAVINE - CLOSE SHOT - BRAD AND MARTIN \nBrad is looking out into the night -- strain and tension in every line. Beyond them we may see some of the other men -- sitting or sprawled on the ground near a sheltered fire. \nBRAD (a whisper) If only she's alive... I'll make it up to her... No matter what's happened... I'll make her forget... She's just got to be alive... \nEthan crosses behind them carrying his blanket roll. He looks at them sourly. \nETHAN Get some rest! \nThey move off, heading for their blankets. The CAMERA HOLDS on Ethan as he rolls up his blanket and turns on his side. \nHe fishes a miniature out of his pocket and gravely studies it by the light of the flickering little fire. \n70-A \nCLOSE SHOT - THE MINIATURE - NIGHT \nEXT. CANYON COUNTRY - LONG SHOT - PAST THE SEARCHERS \nAnother Indian file of eight angles out of a different canyon and begins to cut in toward the group -- riding slowly, very quietly. Clayton slightly alters course, veering slightly away from the converging files, but still riding slowly. And then, from ahead but at a 100 yards, another Comanche group seems to rise out of the ground and slowly begins closing the gap. \nETHAN (to Clayton) If you were tryin' to surround 'em, you sure succeeded. \nCLAYTON How far's the river from here, Mose? \nMOSE I been baptized, Reverend... yes suh, been baptized, thank ye... \nCLAYTON Well, you better brace yourself for another one... Ya-HEE! \nAnd with that yell, he drives spurs and cuts sharply at an angle to the converging Indian files -- and every man is with him. In the next instant, the Comanches whoop and give chase. \n74-D \nEXT. OPEN COUNTRY - FULL SHOT - THE CHASE \nwith the Ranger group short-cutting in such a way as to outstrip the Comanche horsemen in a mad dash for the river. \n74-E \nEXT. THE RIVER'S EDGE - FULL SHOT - THE GROUP \nClayton flings his hand up in a signal to halt as the Rangers reach the bank. They rein in, wheel their horses and are reaching for the rifles as the Comanche vanguard races into view -- to find themselves opposed by seven veterans, sitting their horses, rifles at their shoulders. \nThe charge breaks as the seven rifles bark, almost in unison -- and the Indians wheel to shelter. \nCLAYTON YA-HEE! \nAnd once again he spins his mount and takes off, across the river, followed by the others. \n74-F \nEXT. THE RIVER - FULL SHOT \nAs the men pound across. \n74-G \nEXT. FAR BANK OF RIVER - FULL SHOT - THE GROUP \nThey dismount and Charlie and Nesby take the horses and run them to some place of protection as the men group around Clayton and Ethan. During this: \nCLAYTON (shouting his orders) This is as good as any... Charlie, you and Ed take the horses... \nMose runs over and crouches beside Ethan. Beyond Ethan is Martin, then Brad... Nesby and Charlie will rejoin the group after an appropriate interval... with all the men shielded behind river boulders, etc. \nEXT. RIVER'S EDGE - ANGLING PAST ETHAN AND MOSE WITH MARTIN AND BRAD BEYOND \nEthan and Mose are hunkered down behind some rocks, very casual and business-like as they check rifles, set out and carefully wipe cartridges. \nMOSE (chattily) Minds me o' the time Joe Powers an' me fit us some Kiowas... \nMartin is in the throes of buck-fever, wiping mouth with back of his hand, peering anxiously across the river. \nMARTIN You think they mean to charge us, Uncle Ethan...? \nMOSE ...We found us an ole buffler wallow... \nBRAD (staring across river) Criminy! \nEXT. RIVER'S EDGE - LONG SHOT - PAST THE GROUP \nOn the opposite bank, we see the full force of Comanches riding into sight -- racing their mounts to the edge, then wheeling off -- jeering, taunting. Brad starts to bring up his rifle. \nETHAN Steady, Daniel Boone! You don't want to miss... It makes them think their medicine's stronger than yours... \nMOSE Ay-he... That's jest what I tole Joe Powers... That un's gettin' kinda sassy, ain't he, Ethan? \nOne Comanche rides a few yards into the water, brandishing his rifle, taunting the white men. A moment later he is joined by a second brave. \nETHAN (grimly) Real sassy. \nHe and Mose slowly bring their rifles to bear -- and then the two shots crack out almost simultaneously. And within split seconds both Comanches fall. The others race away. \nSam comes charging over to Ethan and Mose. \nCLAYTON (angrily) I didn't give any order to fire! \nETHAN That's all right, Captain... I don't need any formal invitation to kill a Comanch... \nCLAYTON (grimly) You got one now! \nAnd he drops behind a rock as, with a wild whooping, the Comanche forces swing from their places of hiding and hit the river. The men open fire, all but Martin, who has frozen, staring wild-eyed at the oncoming Comanches. \nEXT. RIVER'S EDGE - PROFILE SHOT - THE DEFENDERS \nBrad, Charlie, Clayton, Nesby are snapping shot after shot. \nOnly Martin seems out of it. Ethan shoots him a glance. \nETHAN Slack your shoulders... Slack 'em... Your hands'll take care of themselves... \nSome of the tension leaves Martin. Somehow his gun is in position and he is firing as fast and well as the others. \n77-A \nEXT. THE RIVER - FULL SHOT - INDIAN CHARGE \nThe Comanches are coming in, crouched low over their ponies' necks, whooping and firing. Men and horses go down, counted off by the expert marksmanship of the Texans. But they keep coming. \nThe ANGLE is past some spectacular butte or citadel of rock into another long reach of valley -- different from the first view of it, yet alike in its suggestion of endlessness. \nBut now there is no cloud of dust far away -- nothing to suggest the passage of anything but time itself. \nEthan, Martin, and Brad ride into the fringe of the butte's shadow and scan the terrain ahead. \nBRAD (shrill) They got to stop sometime... if they're human at all, they got to stop! \nETHAN Naw... a human man rides a horse till it dies... then he goes on afoot... A Comanche comes along... gets that horse up... and rides it twenty more miles... Then he eats it. \nEthan turns to catch Martin thirstily drinking from his canteen. \nETHAN (angrily) Easy on that! \nMARTIN Sorry... We don't even know if Debbie 'n Lucy are with this bunch... Maybe they split up... \nETHAN They're with 'em -- if they're still alive. \nBrad wheels on him. \nBRAD You've said that enough!... Maybe Lucy's dead... maybe they're both dead... but if I hear it from you again, I'll fight ya, Mr. Edwards! \nETHAN (an aside) That'll be the day!... Let's ride. \nWIPE TO: \nOMITTED \n89-A \nEXT. VALLEY AND CANYON WALL - WIDE ANGLE - THE RIDERS - \nLATE AFTERNOON \n(NOTE: This is the gap in the rocks near the \"Medicine Country\" at Monument.) \nThe three riders come to where the trail they have been following forks... the main horseprint track leading ahead, a lesser track heading for a narrow gap between two buttes. \nMARTIN Four of 'em cut out here... Why? \nEthan thinks he knows why. His face is bleak. But he tries to be casual. \nETHAN I'll take a look... You keep after the others... \nHe turns his mount toward the gap. \nMARTIN (eagerly) You want us to fire a shot if... \nETHAN (disgustedly) No... nor build bonfires... nor beat drums neither. I'll meet you on the far side. \nHe's still grumbling as he rides off. An abashed Martin rides ahead along the broad trail with Brad. \n(NOTE: Ethan's serape, tied behind his saddle, should be clearly seen as he rides away -- not pointed up, but visible.) \nWIPE TO: \nEXT. FAR SIDE OF BUTTE - TWILIGHT \nMartin and Brad, riding in a direction opposite to that in which they had taken off -- indicating their circle route -- haul up momentarily as they spot Ethan, standing beside his horse, his back to them, some distance along. They turn slightly off their course and ride out toward him. \nEXT. OPEN COUNTRY - NEAR BUTTE - TWILIGHT \nEthan turns, almost startled, as the two youths ride in. \nHis serape is no longer behind his saddle. Ethan looks at them blankly for a minute -- as though not really seeing them. \nETHAN Oh... it's you. \nThey both stare at him. \nETHAN (a vague gesture) I... uh... here's where they met up again... \nThey both can see that. \nETHAN (pointing) Trail leads off there... \nThey look at him and each other -- for these are clearly unnecessary remarks and doubly surprising coming from Ethan. \nBRAD Why'd they break off? (no answer) Was there water in that canyon? \nETHAN Huh...?  No... no water. \nMARTIN You all right, Ethan? \nETHAN Huh...? (more like his usual gruff self) Sure I'm all right... \nHe goes to his horse, mounts. Martin is right beside him and he notes the missing serape. \nMARTIN Say!... What happened to your blanket? Lose it? \nETHAN Must've... Anyway, I ain't goin' back to look for it... \nHe leads out. Brad rides up beside Martin. Again the two exchange puzzled looks. Martin shrugs and the three continue along the broad trace of the Indian ponies into the setting sun. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. NIGHT CAMP - A POCKET IN THE HILLS - TWILIGHT \nEthan crouches over a small fire built into a slit trench so that barely the glow of the flames can be seen. Beyond him Martin is leading their unsaddled horses away. The men have come to the end of another long day. Both men look up as Brad comes over a hill slope and rides recklessly down the incline to their camp. His horse is lathered. \nBRAD (shouting it) I saw her!... I saw Lucy! \nETHAN Jorgensen's been runnin' his cattle with my own... \nMARTIN (staring) YOUR cattle?... DEBBIE'S cattle! \nEthan returns the stare without any change of expression. \nETHAN He's agreed to take you on and share the increase from my herd while I'm gone... I'll be pushin' on tomorrow... \nMARTIN I ain't stayin'... I set out lookin' for Debbie... I aim to keep on... \nETHAN Why? \nMARTIN Because she's my... my... \nETHAN She's your nothin'... She's no kin to you at all! \nMARTIN I always felt like she was... Her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own... \nETHAN That don't make 'em kin... \nMARTIN All right... I ain't got no kin... I'm goin' to keep lookin' that's all. \nETHAN How? You got any horses, or money to buy 'em... You ain't even got money to buy cartridges... Jorgensen's offering you a good livin' here... \nMartin throws himself back, turns his face to the wall. \nEthan looks soberly at him -- and is sorry for the brutality of his words. \nETHAN Martin... I want you to know somethin'... \nMARTIN (turning -- mad as hell) Yeah... you want me to know I ain't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man's clothes to wear!... You tole me that already... Now shut your head! \nETHAN Good night. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. THE JORGENSEN HOME - WIDE ANGLE - DAWN LIGHT \nIt is a still scene, with the first light of day in the sky, a thin plume of smoke rising from the chimney. \nINT. THE JORGENSEN KEEPING ROOM - MED. CLOSE SHOT - LAURIE - DAWN LIGHT \nShe is in a robe made of an Indian blanket, belted snugly around her waist. She wears moccasins for slippers. Her flannel nightgown is high at the collar and almost trails the floor. She is at the stove, frying bacon and eggs; a coffee pot is on the boil. Beyond her the door to the grandmother room opens and Martin comes in -- dressed in Brad's clothes. His eyes whip around the room. Laurie doesn't turn as he slowly approaches. \nLAURIE (quietly) Ethan rode on... an hour ago. \nThe starch goes out of him. He walks heavily to the table and sits, slumped. She looks at him compassionately. \nLAURIE I don't know what you can do about finding Debbie that he can't... \nHe just shakes his head, not looking at her. She lifts the food from the skillet onto a plate and sets it before him. \nLAURIE He'll find her now, Martie... Please believe me... I know. \nHe shakes his head. She crosses to the stove for the coffee pot. \nMARTIN That's what scares me -- him findin' her. \nNow it is her turn to stare. \nMARTIN Laurie, I've seen his eyes when he so much as hears the word 'Comanche' ...I've seen him take his knife an' ...never mind... But he's a man can go crazy wild... It might come on him when it was the worst thing could be... What I counted on, I hoped to be there to stop him, if such thing come. \nLaurie has poured his coffee. Now he sips it. She sits at the table with him. \nLAURIE (slowly) I hoped I could hold you here... But I guess I knew... So I stole this for you... \nShe takes Ethan's letter from her breast and hands it to him. He takes it, puzzled, and slowly reads it aloud. \nMARTIN 'I bought a small size dress off a Injun... If this here is a piece of yr chiles dress bring reward. I know where they gone... Jerem Futterman.' \nMartin is on his feet. \nMARTIN (excited) Futterman!... He's got a little tradin' post on the South Fork o' the Brazos... Laurie, I just got to get me a good horse! Think yer pa would... \nLAURIE Finish your breakfast... \nMARTIN I gotta catch up with him, Laurie! \nLAURIE (almost in tears -- but angry) Go on then! Pa's in the barn saddlin' the Fort Worth stud... an' you can take the light gelding with the blaze... \nMARTIN But that's Sweet-face -- your own good horse. \nLaurie goes to the front door and throws it wide. \nLAURIE (hysterically) Take it and welcome... but don't count on finding me here when you get back... I've been dallying around this god-forsaken wind-scour almost two long years waitin' for you... I ain't cut out to be an old maid! \nMARTIN (miserably) I can't help it, Laurie... I just gotta catch up with Ethan... \nHe runs out and she slams the door, then rests her head against it. \n113-A \nINT. JORGENSEN KEEPING ROOM - FULL SHOT - EARLY MORNING \nMrs. Jorgensen quietly enters the room and sees Laurie with head pressed against the door. She wants to offer some word of sympathy, but doesn't know what to say. She crosses to the stove to pour herself a cup of coffee. Then we hear the drum of horses' hooves, the sound of Martin riding away. Laurie flings open the door, almost as though to call him back. \n113-B \nEXT. PLAINS COUNTRY AND LAKE BEFORE JORGENSEN HOUSE - EARLY MORNING \nANGLING from behind Laurie in the doorway as Martin, riding one horse, leading another, goes galloping away. \nETHAN Wouldn't surprise me if we didn't have a frost 'fore mornin'... Here... (he picks up a saddle and puts it close to fire) Whyn't you bed down closer to the fire, boy? \nMartin is a bit surprised as Ethan takes the blanket and spreads it near the saddle -- making the saddle serve as a pillow. Then Ethan tosses a few more heavy pieces of dry wood on the fire, making it blaze up. \nMARTIN Hey! What's the idea...? \nETHAN Maybe I'm gettin' like Mose Harper -- my bones is cold tonight... \nHe spreads his own blanket as Martin wraps into his bedroll, and when Martin turns, he casually arranges the blanket to suggest it is over the figure of a man. During this: \nMARTIN Funny... When we passed through Fort Wingate last winter, we didn't hear mention of any Nawyecky Comanche there... \nEthan steps back -- and studies the \"dummy.\" \nETHAN Not so funny... if you recollect what 'Nawyecka' means... \nMARTIN What's that? \nEthan studies Martin's back -- the light on him -- and looks around figuring the range of fire. \nETHAN Sorta like 'roundabout' -- like a man says he's goin' one place when he means to go just the reverse... \nMARTIN (drowsily) Oh... \nETHAN You all settled an' comfortable now? \nMartin just grunts and snugs deeper into his blanket. Ethan nods his satisfaction -- sure Martin isn't going to change positions. Then he takes off his hat and boots and uses them to complete the dummy. He picks up his rifle then and quietly walks out of the camp. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HILLY COUNTRY - A RAVINE OR ARROYO - FULL SHOT - THREE MEN - NIGHT \nThree shadowy figures -- Futterman and his two henchmen -- are quietly dismounting, taking rifles from saddle scabbards. \nAt a hand signal from Futterman, they quietly fan out afoot. \nEXT. NIGHT CAMP - MED. CLOSE SHOT - MARTIN \nstill snug in his blankets, sound asleep; the fire burning a little lower but still shedding plenty of light on him. \nEXT. HILLY COUNTRY - FULL SHOT - FROM BEHIND FUTTERMAN AND HIS HENCHMEN \nAt a crouch or crawling, the three worm their way among some rocks until they reach a slight rise looking down into the camp. Martin is asleep and next to him is Ethan's dummy, hat over its face, and the fire still burning. The two henchmen snake their rifles up to a firing position. A shot cracks... and one man is knocked flat on his face. \nThe other whirls in the direction of the shot, his rifle swinging in search of a target. A second shot splits the night and the breed falls as though hit by a giant fist... \nMartin is sitting up now, staring wildly around. Futterman starts to run down-slope, away from the hidden marksman, dodging between the rocks. A third shot catches him in the back and he spins and falls and rolls down the slope into the firepit camp area. Martin is on his feet now. \nEXT. NIGHT CAMP - FULL SHOT - MARTIN \nHe is staring at Futterman, face down and almost at his feet. He looks around in fear at someone approaching -- hand going to his gun. Then he relaxes as Ethan casually enters the camp, bareheaded, carrying his rifle. \nETHAN Thanks... you did just fine... \nEthan kneels beside Futterman, turns him over, reaches into his pockets -- first one, then another. \nMARTIN (dazed) Futterman? \nETHAN He just couldn't wait... \nMARTIN (watching him go through pockets) Whatchu doin'?... \nEthan grins satisfiedly as he straightens and spins the gold piece in the air, catches it and pockets it. \nETHAN Even got my twenty dollars back... We did all right. \nAnd now Martin is getting the whole picture... and he's mad. \nMARTIN WE?... You just used me for bait -- staked me out like a... buildin' up the fire... fixin' it so's... I coulda had my brains blowed out! \nEthan is just grinning at him -- completely unruffled, denying none of it. \nMARTIN (explosively) Suppose you'd missed! \nEthan sobers a little, seems honestly surprised. \nETHAN Never occurred to me... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. THE JORGENSEN HOME - WIDE ANGLE - DAY \nIt is a day in early winter. Charlie MacCorry, short-coated, is galloping across the yard as Jorgensen crosses it -- carrying a load of firewood. \nCHARLIE (calling it) Howdy, Mister Jorgensen... \nJORGENSEN Charlie... \nMacCorry swings off his saddle near the porch, as the door opens and Mrs. Jorgensen comes out -- shawled against the cold. \nCHARLIE Got a letter here... \nJorgensen lets the cordwood drop... \nJORGENSEN By golly! A letter? \nCHARLIE For Miss Laurie... \nMRS. JORGENSEN Come in, Charlie, come in... (calling inside) LAURIE!... My land!... Two letters in the one year!... \nINT. JORGENSEN KEEPING ROOM - FULL SHOT \nreading the letter. She is at the bottom of a page. \nLAURIE 'There is one other thing I got to tell you before you hear it from Ethan... How I got myself a wife'... \nShe stops and stares. \nLAURIE A WIFE? \nShe looks at them - dazed. \nCHARLIE (delightedly) He did? \nJORGENSEN (smacking his knee -- very happy indeed) Good! A young man should get married early in life. Right, mama? \nMrs. Jorgensen, full of sympathy for Laurie, just glares at her husband. \nJORGENSEN Every young man should at least once...Go on, Laurie! Read! \nLAURIE (haltingly) A little Comanche squaw - SQUAW! \nAnd with that she crumples the letter and throws it into the fire. \nMRS. JORGENSEN (aghast) Laurie! \nJorgensen is out of his chair and scrambling in the fireplace to recover the letter. He fetches it out, beating the sparks out. The letter is basically undamaged. \nJORGENSEN (sternly) Is no way to treat a letter, Laurie ...Mama maybe you better read it... (to Charlie, proudly) My wife was a school teacher, Charlie ...She reads good. \nLaurie snatches the letter back. \nLAURIE I'll read it... \nCharlie crosses the room, picks up a guitar. \nCHARLIE (smugly) So he married a Comanche squaw... Haw haw haw! \nLaurie glares at him. He begins chording the guitar. \nWIPE TO: \nEXT. INDIAN ENCAMPMENT - MED. CLOSE SHOT - MARTIN AND \"LOOK\" - FALL OR EARLY WINTER - DAY \n\"LOOK\" is somewhat under five feet tall, pigeon-toed, platter- faced and wide-eyed. Over her arm is a very handsome blanket. She is coming forward shyly toward Martin, propelled by a Comanche -- her father. Martin, with an armful of trade goods -- a few yards of bright calico, a couple of AGED SOW rosettes and some trinkets -- is indicating the blanket. Look glances shyly at her father. \nHe shakes his head negatively. Look is disappointed. \nThe father points to Martin's pile of trade goods. Martin bends and picks up the indicated object: it is a battered high-crowned beaver hat. The Indian grunts his approval and puts it on. Look looks relieved. Martin reaches for the blanket. Look takes a quick step backward and holds up one finger: wait! Then she runs back through the other Comanches now crowding forward. \nEXT. INDIAN ENCAMPMENT - ANOTHER ANGLE - FULL SHOT - INCLUDING ETHAN \nwho rides in slowly, leading their pack horse and Martin's horse. \nETHAN (quietly) Let's go... I think I stumbled onto somethin'... \nMARTIN (eagerly) Scar? \nThe name registers with some of the nearer braves. There is a quick interchange of glances, frowning, hostile. \nETHAN (angrily) When are you goin' to learn to keep your mouth shut! Come on.  Let's get out of here. \nMARTIN But I just bought a good blanket. \nETHAN (curtly) Forget it... \nMartin mounts and the two ride out. The Comanches stare after them suspiciously, resentfully. \nEXT. OPEN COUNTRY - FULL SHOT - ETHAN AND MARTIN - MOVING SHOT - EARLY WINTER DAY \nThey are riding down a slight grade beyond which (we can assume) is the Comanche camp. \nETHAN What I heard back there was that a band o' hostile Nawyeckas came through this way less'n two weeks ago... \nMARTIN (excitedly) Think it might be...? \nHe breaks and both turn as Look rides over the hill on a little spotted Indian pony, with her squaw-bag slung up behind her and her blanket over the saddle. She closes the gap between them. \nETHAN What's she followin' for? \nLook smiles shyly at Martin. \nMARTIN Look, I changed my mind... You can keep your blanket. \nHe gestures for her to go back. \nMARTIN Go on back... \nShe stares and then dutifully wheels her horse. Martin and Ethan face front again. Look wheels her horse again and is right with them. Martin stops - exasperated. \nMARTIN Look... you don't understand... (he waves her away) I don't want it. \nLook just sits. \nETHAN (explosively) YOU don't understand, ya chunkhead! You didn't buy any blanket! Ya bought her! \nMARTIN (aghast) What? \nETHAN You got yourself a wife, sonny! \nMARTIN (a wail) Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back... \nETHAN And have her whole family after our scalps for floutin' one o' their women?... No sir! Come on, Mrs. Pauley... \nINT. JORGENSEN HOME - GROUP AS BEFORE - LAURIE READING - DAY \nMrs. Jorgensen is bringing a lighted lamp over to the table where Laurie is reading against the fading light of day. Jorgensen's pipe has gone out and he lights it. \nLAURIE Maybe she left other signs for us to follow but we'll never know -- 'cause it snowed all day and all the next week... We were heading north, through the buffalo country when something happened that I ain't got straight in my own mind yet... (her voice fades) \n137-A \nEXT. SNOW COUNTRY - WIDE ANGLE SHOT - TWO RIDERS (COLORADO FOOTAGE) \nThe two men are picking their way through a snow-mantled grove. Martin's voice resumes the narration. \nMARTIN'S VOICE Ethan's always been throwing it up to me that I'm a quarter-breed... I never figgered it made much difference... \n137-B \nEXT. BUFFALO HERD - WIDE ANGLE SHOT - DAY (COLO. FOOTAGE) \nMARTIN'S VOICE But this day we came on a small herd. We needed some meat so we circled 'round... \n137-C \nEXT. THE HERD - ANOTHER ANGLE (COLO. FOOTAGE) \nMARTIN'S VOICE ...and came up on 'em afoot...  They hadn't been hunted, so it was no trick workin' in close. \n137-D \nEXT. THE HERD - MARTIN AND ETHAN - DAY (COLO. FOOTAGE) \nThe two men walk from behind CAMERA. Ethan aims, fires and brings down a bull. \nMARTIN'S VOICE Ethan got a nice one on his first shot, but then he began killing one after another -- cows as well as bulls -- fast as he could fire and load... It was just a slaughter... no sense to it... \n137-E \nEXT. THE HERD BEGINNING TO RUN (COLO. FOOTAGE) \nShots cracking out -- the terrified bawling of the bulls -- the beginning of the stampede. \n137-F \nEXT. MED. CLOSE SHOT - ETHAN AND MARTIN (PROCESS) \nMartin strides across to where Ethan is firing. \nMARTIN Ethan, quit it! \nETHAN (firing again) Nine... (another shot) Ten! \nMARTIN What's the sense in it! \nEthan turns and swings a backhand blow which catches Martin by surprise and fells him. \nETHAN (in a fury) Hunger! -- Empty bellies! That's the sense in it, you Cherokee!... \nHe swings up his gun and fires again -- and again... as Martin stares at him from the ground. \n137-G \nEXT. THE HERD - LONG SHOT - THE STAMPEDE (COLO. FOOTAGE) \nFear-maddened animals are swinging into full stampede fleeing the deadly marksman. Rifle shots keep cracking out. \n137-H \nEXT. MED. CLOSE SHOT - ETHAN AND MARTIN AS BEFORE (PROCESS) \nThe thunder of the hooves is receding and Ethan grimly lowers his rifle. Martin picks himself up -- still staring at Ethan as though at a madman. Ethan turns and looks at him. \nETHAN Least, THEY won't feed any Comanches this winter... Killin' buffalo's as good as killin' Injuns in this country. \nMARTIN Peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo, too.... \nETHAN Ain't that too bad... If you feel that sorry for your kinfolk, I'm surprised you didn't take up with that squaw wife of yours... \nHe whips out his shinning knife and strides toward the dead buffalo o.s. Martin looks after him with troubled expression. Suddenly he hears something, borne faint by the wind. \nMARTIN ETHAN! \nEthan turns. Now faintly, little more than a shred of sound, is the distant blowing of a bugle. \nMARTIN Listen!... Hear it?... There! Ain't that a bugle... and firing? \nEthan stares -- and then the bugle sound repeats and the distant crack of shots, from long miles off. \nETHAN (grimly) Just hope we ain't too late... \nAnd the two break and run for their horses. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nOMITTED \nEXT. A RIVER - WIDE ANGLE - CAVALRY CROSSING WITH PRISONERS - DAY \nMARTIN'S VOICE (as narrator) It was all over long before we got there and the soldiers was high- tailin' it back to the agency with their prisoners -- squaws mostly -- by the time Ethan and me reached the camp... \nEXT. SNOW SLOPE - WIDE ANGLE - ETHAN AND MARTIN \nHorses and riders plunge downslope through breast-high snow. \nETHAN Tequila... \nMARTIN Lo mismo. \nPROPRIETOR (beaming) Y' par' el Viejo -- el vino del pais... tequila tambien! \nMartin puts his back to the bar, leans elbows on it and looks around. \n158A \nINT. THE CANTINA - ANGLING PAST MARTIN TOWARD ESTRELLA \nShe is giving him an appraising once-over, then signals the musicians to play. She rests her buttocks against a table and waits, her eyes challenging Martin to make a move. Emilio is watching Estrella and Martin with something akin to bored amusement. \n158B \nINT. THE CANTINA - ANGLE AT BAR \nEthan has poured a drink for Mose, now one for himself -- leaving Martin's glass empty. \nMOSE I been helpin' ye, Ethan... I been lookin' all the time... \nMartin turns back to the bar to take his glass. He finds it empty. \nMARTIN (to Ethan's back) Thanks for nothin'... \nHe angrily throws a coin on the counter, appropriates the bottle and his glass and heads for a table closer to Estrella. Neither Ethan nor Mose seems aware of his going. \nETHAN Well, the reward still stands... \nMOSE Don't want no money, Ethan... jus' a place -- a roof over m' head... a little grub... a bunk to sleep in... an' a rockin' chair by the fire... my own rockin' chair by a fire... \nETHAN You help me find her, you got your rockin' chair... \nMOSE Swear it, Ethan?... Given word? \nETHAN (impatiently) Told ya, didn't I? \nMOSE (impressively) Ethan... I found a man's seen her... knows where little Debbie is! \nEthan stares at him. Mose nods his reaffirmation of it. \nThen Ethan's hand locks on the old man's shoulder. \nETHAN Who? Where is he... this man? \nMose winces under the grip. He can't speak, but he looks past Ethan and he points. Ethan turns. Emilio swings his boots off the table and slowly crosses to them. He lets cigarette smoke curl out of his mouth. Then he smiles. \nEMILIO I am this man, senor... Emilio Gabriel Fernandez y Figueroa... at your service... (afterthought) ...for a price... (he smiles) ...Always for a price... \nAs the men study each other, Estrella begins her dance -- and the rhythmic click of the castanets will beat like a metronome. Emilio looks at the bottle on the bar, disdainfully pushes it away and imperiously signals the proprietor to bring something better. \nEMILIO Un otra! \nINT. THE CANTINA - ANGLING PAST MARTIN TO ESTRELLA \nHe is knocking off his tequila and looking at the girl hungrily. She is doing her swaying dance, playing up to him and with unmistakable effect. He sloshes another drink into his glass and, never taking his eyes off her, downs it. \nINT. THE CANTINA - FULL SHOT - ANOTHER ANGLE - THE DANCE \nBeyond Estrella we see Ethan, Emilio, and Mose at the bar -- gestures, headshakes, the entire pantomime of an inaudible conversation. Then Ethan takes out his pouch and begins dropping gold pieces into Emilio's hand. Meanwhile, dance and dancer are achieving their purpose with Martin. And the tequila is working. He gets to his feet, a little groggily. Estrella's smile deepens and there is a clear invitation in her eyes... Ethan turns then, his deal with Emilio concluded, and he sees what is going on. He starts for Martin's table just as Martin moves out to take the girl. \nETHAN (tolerantly) Come on, Don Juan... We're on our way... \nMartin tries to push him away, his eyes still on the girl. \nMARTIN (thickly) Lemme alone... \nETHAN (taking his arm) You breeds are all alike -- two drinks an'... \nMartin breaks free and squares off. \nMARTIN Take yer hands off'n me... This lady an' me got some things to talk over! \nEstrella ranges herself alongside of Martin and slips an arm possessively through his. \nETHAN (a shrug) Suit yourself... While you're enjoyin' your little conversation, I'll be ridin' out with Senor Fernandez here...  The Comanch' medicine country ain't far... there's one camp with a chief named Cicatriz. \nMARTIN Never heard of him... \nETHAN Cicatriz is Mex for Scar... an' he has a white girl in his tepee... Be seein' you... \nHe turns and heads out. Emilio, who has come up behind him, gives Estrella a slight smile and bow. \nEMILIO Buena suerte, Estrella... Hasta la vista. \nHe follows Ethan. Estrella swings her body close to Martin and lets her arms slide around his neck. \nESTRELLA (softly) Tu quieres...? \nMartin blinks to clear away the fog of tequila and desire. \nMARTIN (a bitter laugh) Sure... sure... Only not this year... \nHe pulls her arms away and goes lurching after the others. \nMose catches his arm. \nMOSE 'Mind Ethan 'bout my rockin' chair! \nMartin continues out and Mose stands there -- his head rockin' as though he already were in his chair. \nINT. THE TEPEE - ANGLING PAST ETHAN TOWARD THE TWO YOUNG ONES \nETHAN (glancing at them) Are those his wives too? \nOne of the squaws turns -- and even in the shadows we see it is another Indian face. The other does not turn. \nScar leans in, blocking the view. \nSCAR Two sons -- killed by white men... For each son, I take many scalps... (in Comanche) Mayah-kay zee-eh!... (Bring the lance!) \nThe slightly smaller of the young squaws stiffens but doesn't move. Scar glares. \nSCAR (louder) MAYAH-KAY ZEE-EH! \nThe girl gets to her feet. Ethan and Martin watch as, still with averted face, she crosses to where a lance hangs from the tepee wall. It has several scalps on it, including one with light red hair. Slowly she carries it back. Scar never takes his eyes from the faces of the white men, savoring every moment of it. The girl extends the lance between them, so that it is like a bare blade separating two duelists. Neither Ethan nor Martin dares at first look at more than the scalp pole... Then slowly their eyes lift... and the CAMERA MOVES IN and RAISES TO: \nINT. THE TEPEE - EXTREME CLOSE SHOT - DEBBIE \nAs the shawl slips back to reveal her light hair, the slant green eyes looking at them from a tanned, but still white and very beautiful face. (NOTE TO MUSIC: The SEARCH THEME should cover all the foregoing action -- but at the first clear view of DEBBIE, it ends dramatically.) \nDebbie's eyes hold theirs -- and then Scar's voice is heard: \nSCAR (in Comanche) Pie-kay! (Go!) \nSwiftly she straightens, takes away the scalp pole and goes back to her former place. \nINT. THE TEPEE - MED. CLOSE SHOT - THE GROUP AS BEFORE \nScar is watching the white men like a hawk. Martin's eyes are wide and his breathing seems suspended. But Ethan is playing it like a poker player. \nETHAN (his voice controlled) I've seen scalps before... \nScar's eyes are mocking. He lets his robe slip back from his shoulders, revealing a bare bronzed chest on which -- glinting in the reflected firelight -- is the medallion that Ethan had given Debbie. It is suspended by a chain or rawhide string. Scar touches it. \nSCAR This before? \nEthan smiles -- and he's still playing poker. He stands... and the others follow. Scar is puzzled. \nETHAN (to Emilio) I came to trade, not to admire his collection... Tell him we're going to pitch camp across the crick... Maybe we can talk trade tomorrow. \nScar hasn't understood all of it. He scowls and looks at Emilio. \nSCAR (in Comanche) Ee-sap! Pabbo-tie-bo ee-sap! (He lies! The gringo lies!) \nEMILIO (placatingly) Tomorrow -- manana -- 'puetze.' \nScar looks at Ethan and at Martin. He smiles slightly, and he nods his agreement. \nSCAR Puetze! \nMartin and Ethan turn to go. Only then does Debbie look swiftly at them and as swiftly away. Martin can't help but pause, but Ethan prods him toward the tepee flap. \nEXT. THE TEPEE - MED. CLOSE SHOT - MOVING - THE THREE MEN \nThey emerge from the tepee and begin to walk away -- not fast, not slow, and without a side glance. Scar emerges and looks after them -- glowering. A few other Comanches begin to gather near his tepee. \nEMILIO (urgently) Walk with dignity! (after a moment; lips hardly moving) If you gringo heretics have any prayers, say them... \nMARTIN (transfigured) She's alive... Can you believe it, she's alive... alive... An' we found her... \nEMILIO (fervently) Please!... I, too, am alive... I wish to stay that way. \nThey reach the waiting cargadores and the pack train, surrounded by suspicious Comanches. \nEMILIO (to his men) Vamanos! \nThey mount and ride out. \nWIPE TO: \nEXT. SAND DUNES NEAR NEEDLES (MONUMENT) - FULL SHOT - LATE AFTERNOON \nEmilio is standing near his horse, talking to Ethan and Martin. \nEMILIO You understand, senores... It is not that I am cobarde... cowardly... \nETHAN Don't apologize... You did your job... \nEmilio nods and mounts. \nEMILIO He knows you -- who you are -- and why you are here... This I did not understand... or I would not... even for gold, senores... have led you here. \nHe fumbles for a pouch, holds it out to Ethan. \nEMILIO Take it. I do not want blood money. Vaya con Dios! \nHe digs spurs and rides out. Ethan turns and looks soberly at Martin. We hear the rest of the riders moving away. \nEthan and Martin cross the sand and go down slope toward the creek where their horses are waiting. \n174-A \nEXT. SAND CREEK (MONUMENT) - FULL SHOT - THE TWO - DAY \nMARTIN You figger Scar means to kill us? \nETHAN He's got to... All these years, runnin', dodgin', knowin' we were after him... Now we caught up... It's him or us. \nMARTIN Why didn't he make his move back there? \nETHAN I don't know... Somethin' tied his hands... maybe hospitality... \nETHAN (to all) Evenin'... evenin' Reverend... or do I call you 'Captain'...? \nCLAYTON Came here for a wedding, Ethan... Until that's over, I reckon 'reverend' will do... \nMRS. JORGENSEN (coming forward) And news of our little girl, Ethan? \nHis face contorts and his smile is twisted. \nETHAN She's not a little girl any more. \nMRS. JORGENSEN (eyes wide) You've seen her!... She's alive? \nETHAN I've seen her... and she's alive. \nMrs. Jorgensen throws herself against his chest, sobbing. \nEthan looks past her at Clayton. And the faces of both men are grim. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE GRANDMOTHER ROOM - FULL SHOT \nThe room is dark. Martin is pacing, eyes constantly turning to the inside door. And then it opens and Laurie is inside, holding a lamp. She is in her bridal gown and very obviously trying to keep from betraying the stress she is under. \nLAURIE (quietly) Hello, Martie.... \nHe just stares at her -- very lovely, strangely remote. \nHe suddenly is conscious of his dirty hands, his dusty, worn clothing. \nMARTIN I... I wrote you a letter... Reckon you didn't get it... \nLAURIE (setting the lamp down) One letter in five years... I read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out... \nMARTIN It wasn't much of a letter... \nLAURIE No, it wasn't... You mighta said you loved me... You mighta asked me to wait... At least that'd have been something... \nMARTIN But I allus loved you... You know that, without my sayin' it... I couldn't bring myself to ask you to wait... the little I had... not knowin' how much longer until we found Debbie... \nLAURIE (breaking) It isn't fair... \nShe sinks onto the bench. \nLAURIE (sobbing) It isn't fair, Martin Pauley, and you know it! \nShe begins to cry, very softly. He is beside her and his arm goes around her shoulder comfortingly. \nMARTIN Don't cry, Laurie... I understand how it is... I'll just go 'way... \nLAURIE (spinning on him) You do and I'll die, Martie... I will! I'll just die! \nAnd they are kissing through her tears when the outer door is flung open by Charlie MacCorry. They part as he glares. \nCHARLIE I'll thank you to leave the room, Laurie. \nMartin stares at him, then at her. \nMARTIN (incredulous) Charlie MacCorry!... You weren't fixin' to marry HIM?? \nCHARLIE She sure is!... An' don't think your comin' back is goin' to change it! \nMARTIN As to that, I don't know, Charlie... We hadn't got around to talkin' marriage... \nCHARLIE What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman... \nMARTIN (angrily) If you're talkin' about that crazy murder charge... \nCHARLIE AND other things... Mebbe you thought you was gettin' away with being comical about that Indian wife you took... I bet she wasn't the first squaw you... \nMartin swings wildly but Charlie is a wily fighter. He side- steps and chops Martin in the jaw and drives him against the wall. Laurie runs between them. \nLAURIE Stop it! Both of you... I won't have any fighting in this house. \nMartin gently brushes her aside. \nMARTIN It's all right... Charlie, let's move outside. \nCHARLIE I ain't wearing no gun. \nMartin nods and unbuckles his gunbelt. The men head outside as Laurie runs to get help. \nEXT. THE JORGENSEN HOME - BREEZEWAY \nCharlie waits assuredly as Martin follows him outside. \nMartin makes a wild run, swings. The blow is neatly guarded by Charlie's left and countered with a crisp right that puts Martin down. Martin gets to his feet, more cautiously this time, and comes in at a crouch; he's fighting like an Indian, not a white man. The men from the wedding party come out now at a run. \nCLAYTON (yelling) Sergeant MacCorry! \nCharlie turns slightly and in that instant Martin springs and drives a straight right at his face -- almost as though there were a knife in the hand. MacCorry stumbles back into Clayton's arms. \nCLAYTON Is this in the line of duty, sergeant? \nCHARLIE (regaining his balance) No sir... pleasure. \nCLAYTON In that case, give the boys room... \nMartin waits at a crouch as Charlie comes in, feints his right and crosses his left. It is a hard blow but Martin recovers and waits... Charlie circles and starts to repeat. He feints his right but this time Martin springs in, ducks and -- as the left shoots out -- he grabs the wrist and throws Charlie over his head. What we are looking at, in effect, is a wrestler against a boxer. \nCLAYTON Fight fair, son... Use your fists! \nLIEUTENANT That maybe he's not far from here -- holed up somewhere, waiting his chance to get back over the border... He raided north about a month ago... ran into more army than he bargained for... Now he's running for cover, for keeps this time... \nCLAYTON And what makes you think he's in this territory? \nLIEUTENANT Yesterday, one of our patrols picked up a man claims he was a prisoner with Scar till only two days ago... He talks crazy but I brought him along... Says he lives here... keeps mentioning a rocking chair. \nETHAN (half to himself) Mose... \nAnd then he is striding to the door, calling it: \nETHAN MOSE! \nMOSE'S VOICE Ay-he?... Ay-eh?... \nAnd the old man totters in, half-supported by a trooper -- hollow-eyed, weak, almost delirious. \nMOSE Come f'r my rockin' chai'... ole Mose. \nETHAN (shouting it) Where's Scar, Mose... SCAR? \nMARTIN Ask him about Debbie!... Is she all right, Mose? \nMOSE My rockin' chai'... \nMRS. JORGENSEN (bustling over) Leave the poor man be! Can't you see he's out of his mind... \nShe tries to lead him away, but Ethan shoves her aside and grips the old man by his arms. \nETHAN Mose... try to remember!... You were in Scar's camp... \nMOSE Ay-he... Made out I was crazy... (he giggles foolishly) Ate dirt... chewed grass... I fooled 'em, Ethan!... an' I got away... \nETHAN Scar! Where's he holed in? \nMOSE Seven Fingers... ay-he... Seven... \nHe staggers and this time Mrs. Jorgensen won't be denied. \nMRS. JORGENSEN Now that's enough!  Here... by the fire... What you need's a good bowl of soup... \nShe leads him away, at last to his rocker by the fire. \nDuring this, Ethan and Clayton have been mulling Mose's answer. \nETHAN (blankly) Seven Fingers? \nLIEUTENANT That's what he told us... but there's no such place on the maps. \nMARTIN Wait a minute! Isn't that the Caddo name for where all those canyons branch on the Malapai? \nMOSE (from his rocker) Caddo or Kiowa... ay-he... ay-eh... \nSam Clayton wheels on the Lieutenant. \nCLAYTON You tell your pa a company of Rangers -- all fourteen of 'em -- fully armed an' equipped will be in the field by daylight... headin' for the south end of the Malapai. If he can catch up with us, well an' good... \nLIEUTENANT But... but captain, we can't possibly take the field tomorrow... for your own protection... \nCLAYTON Sonny, yonder's a passel of murderers, complete with Texican scalps an' white girl captive... You want to protect us, you just get out of our way... Now skedaddle! \nThe lieutenant skedaddles. Sam whirls on Martin and Ethan. \nCLAYTON Ethan, you an' Martin are hereby appointed civilian scouts -- without pay... Charlie, hightail it to headquarters an' spread the word... \nCHARLIE Yes sir... \nHe leaves. Martin's hands go to his side -- recalling where he left his guns. \nMARTIN My guns... \nHe heads for the inner door to the grandmother room. \nINT. THE GRANDMOTHER ROOM - FULL SHOT \nas Martin enters and crosses to where he had dropped his gunbelt. Even before he reaches it, Laurie is in the room -- closing the door after her. \nLAURIE Martie... don't go! Not this time. \nMARTIN (staring) You crazy? \nLAURIE It's too late... She's a woman grown now... \nMARTIN I got to fetch her home... \nLAURIE Fetch what home?... The leavin's of Comanche bucks -- sold time an' again to the highest bidder?... With savage brats of her own, most like?... \nMARTIN (shouting it) Laurie! Shut your mouth! \nLAURIE Do you know what Ethan will do if he has a chance?... He'll put a bullet in her brain! And I tell you Martha would want him to! \nMARTIN Only if I'm dead! \nHe strides out past her. \nINT. THE KEEPING ROOM - FULL SHOT \nas Martin re-enters. Ethan and Sam are waiting. Martin looks hard at Ethan. \nCLAYTON You ready? \nMARTIN (eyes never leaving Ethan's face) I'm ready. \nGREENHILL (calling -- still distant) Captain Clayton... Captain! \nSam whips off his hat and makes frantic signals to Greenhill to shut up. Greenhill pulls to a canter, puzzled, and rides in. \nCLAYTON (exploding) Go on! Whyn't you have your bugler sound the charge while you're at it?? \nGREENHILL (blankly) Sir? \nCLAYTON Never mind... Your pa know you're out here? \nGREENHILL Yes, sir... Troop's about ten miles back... The Colonel sent me looking for you... \nCLAYTON (dismissing him) Well you found me... Good work, son... Good work. \nHe starts away. Greenhill follows. \nGREENHILL If there's anything I can do, sir... \nCLAYTON (under his breath) God forbid... No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at... and where he's at... \nGREENHILL But he knows THAT, sir... Can't I stay, sir? \nCLAYTON (reluctantly) All right... But keep your eye on me, boy... I'm the hard case you're up against here -- not these childish savages... If you don't hear me first time I holler, you better read my mind... I don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand... \nGREENHILL Yes, sir... \nHe whips out his sabre -- to the imminent peril of Captain Sam who quickly shifts out of the way. \nCLAYTON Watch that knife, boy! \nThen Sam continues away and the Rangers after him. \nEXT. OUTSKIRTS OF COMANCHE CAMP - FULL SHOT - DAWN LIGHT \nMartin runs from behind CAMERA and dodges behind a rock. The camp is still asleep, very quiet. Martin runs out from behind the rock and makes another short dash toward the camp, dropping behind a pile of blankets or other impedimenta. A dog runs out of one of the tepees, begins barking. \nEXT. THE HORSE HERD - MED. CLOSE SHOT - SCAR \nHe stands with another Comanche -- inspecting the horse lines. In the near distance the dog's barking is heard -- shrill, insistent. Scar, almost like an animal, sniffs the air suspiciously. The other Comanche laughs. \nCOMANCHE Tahbo. (A rabbit.) \nScar isn't satisfied but returns to his work. \nEXT. THE COMANCHE CAMP - ANGLE FAVORING SCAR'S TEPEE PAST MARTIN \nHe is staring at it -- remembering it from certain distinct decorations. The lower part of the tepee is rolled up, for better air circulation. Martin wraps Charlie's blanket around him and begins walking to the tepee. \nEXT. THE LEE OF THE HOGBACK OR RISE - FULL SHOT - THE RANGERS \nThe line is drawn up, dismounted, the men checking their sidearms, tightening cinches, etc. Sam moves briskly along the line of men, then mounts his horse. \nCLAYTON The State of Texas is payin' you boys $12 a month. Here's your chance to earn it... Now I don't want any foolin' around after scalps. We ain't got the time... Yankee cavalry's on its way here to set those Comanches free... We gotta beat 'em to it -- our way... Now mount an' guide center on young Greenhill here. Son, you just follow me... And WATCH THAT KNIFE! \nThe last comes as Greenhill tries to mount, simultaneously flailing out his sabre perilously close to Clayton. \nEXT. SCAR'S TEPEE - MED. CLOSE SHOT - MARTIN \nMartin has gained the tepee, takes one quick look around, then strides in. \nINT. SCAR'S TEPEE \nas Martin enters. One robe, tossed back, shows where Scar has slept. Against one wall lie the huddled figures of two squaws. Two other figures -- one being Debbie's -- sleep in robes. Martin's eyes go to Scar's place and then rove slowly and hold on: \nINT. TEPEE - MED. CLOSE SHOT - DEBBIE \nShe moves slightly so that the light strikes her fair hair. Martin kneels close to her and gently touches her shoulder, to awaken her. Her eyes open, then widen in fear. Martin quickly claps a hand over his mouth. \nSilently she fights him, trying to pull the hand away. \nMARTIN (a hoarse whisper) Debbie... don't! \nAnd then her fingernails rake his hand. He winces and lets go. She screams and tries to leap up. He grabs her. The other squaws wake -- begin squawking. \nMARTIN (grimly) I'm takin' you whether you want to or not... \nDebbie sees something beyond him. Her eyes widen. \nDEBBIE (a scream) MARTIN! \nINT. TEPEE - SHOOTING FROM EXTREME LOW ANGLE, AS FROM HER P.O.V. - SCAR \nHe looms in the flap of the tepee much as he had over the grave when he first kidnapped her. He has a scalping knife in his hand. Scar whips his arm back. Behind him we see the other Comanche -- the one from the horse herd. \nINT. TEPEE - FULL SHOT \nMartin spins and his gun is out. He fans the trigger hammer twice -- and both slugs hit Scar. As the other Comanche leaps in, Martin's gun speaks again. And then he is on his feet, catching Debbie by the arm -- unresisting now -- and pulling her after him through the camp. Shouts and cries bespeak the awakening of the camp. \nEXT. THE HOGBACK - FULL SHOT - THE RANGER GROUP \nThey are mounted and in line. The echo of a shot comes bouncing back. Clayton is facing the men. He solemnly doffs his hat and bows his head. \nCLAYTON For these Thy gifts which we are about to receive... (donning his hat, he turns to the bugler) Sound that horn, son, and Leave Us Go Amongst Them...YA-HEE! \nAnd shouting the rebel yell, he leads the charge. The yell is picked up by every man and the bugler sounds the charge as though he had a regiment at his back. Lt. Greenhill -- a West Point beau sabreur in strange company -- has his sabre at the \"charge.\" \nFULL MOVING SHOT - ON THE CHARGE \nIn the swamp of men and horses, we just have time to notice that Sam is darting a somewhat worried look at Greenhill's saber ominously close to his back. The charge is sounding, the hooves are drumming and the men are yelling the way they did when they rode with Bedford Forrest -- reins in their teeth, guns in their fists. \nEXT. THE ENCAMPMENT - FULL SHOT - AS THE RANGERS HIT \n", "test1_input": "OMITTED \nEXT. PLAINS COUNTRY - LOW ANGLE SHOT - ETHAN AND MARTIN - \nAFTERNOON \nIt is a portrait study of two faces -- etched by wind and privation and cold into tragic, fanatic masks. \nMartin has aged years in a matter of months. Falling snow flakes touch their faces and begin to rime their stubbly beards. \nMARTIN (bitterly) Say it. We're beat! \nETHAN (slowly) No... our turnin' back don't change anything... not in the long run. If she's alive, she's safe... for a while... They'll keep her to raise as one of their own, 'til she's of an age to... \nHe turns his mount. \nMARTIN And you think we got a chance to find her? \nETHAN An Injun will chase a thing til he thinks he's chased it enough... Then he quits... Same when he runs... Seems he never learns there's such a thing as a critter that might just keep comin' on... So we'll find them in the end, I promise you that... We'll find them just as sure as the turning of the earth. \nFADE OUT \nOMITTED \nFADE IN \nEXT. THE JORGENSEN HOUSE AND APPROACH - WIDE ANGLE - \nTWILIGHT \nThe time is spring. It is a year and a half later. \nThe Jorgensen house is larger than the Edwards place -- of sod and logs, with a covered breezeway connecting the two separate buildings of the house: one being the keeping room, the other the sleeping quarters of the numerous Jorgensen brood. A meadowlark breaks into his sudden song. A dog or two come barking around the side of the house as Ethan and Martin ride slowly from behind CAMERA toward the house. In that instant a lamp is lighted within the house and Lars Jorgensen comes to the door. \nEXT. THE JORGENSEN HOUSE - FULL SHOT - NEAR DOOR - TWILIGHT \nJorgensen peers at the two men as they ride up - recognizing them, of course, but ill-prepared for the change in their appearance and full of unspoken questions. \nBearing a lamp, Mrs. Jorgensen hurries out to stand beside her husband -- and her face works and tears begin to well in her eyes. Two tow-headed boys -- 13 or 14 -- come after her. Jorgensen makes a little signal with one hand, not even looking at the boys, and they hurry out to take the reins as Ethan and Martin dismount. \nEXT. THE JORGENSEN HOUSE - MED. SHOT - ETHAN AND MARTIN \nThe passage of time has stamped Martin -- and will continue during our story more and more to stamp him -- in the image of Ethan. Now it may show only in the set of his hat or trick of standing; later it will be in his walk, in his speech (or paucity of speech). Neither man is sure of his reception. They are thinking of Brad -- dead because of their search; and Martin is thinking of Laurie. And then Mrs. Jorgensen is running across to Martin and has him in her arms as though he were her son -- saying nothing, just holding him. He stands frozen a moment and then he returns the embrace. Ethan watches a moment, then crosses to Jorgensen. \nETHAN (to Jorgensen) You got my letter about your son, Brad? \nJORGENSEN Yah... Just about this time a year ago... \nMRS. JORGENSEN It came the day before his... birthday. \nJORGENSEN The Lord giveth--the Lord taketh away... \nMrs. Jorgensen starts to lead the way inside. Martin hangs back. \nMARTIN I ain't fit to go indoors, miz Jorgensen... These clothes is... \nLaurie rushes past her mother. \nLAURIE Martie! \nShe kisses him hard and full on the mouth -- and has no eyes for anyone else. Mrs. Jorgensen looks on with amusement. Martin is just bowled over. \nMRS. JORGENSEN (teasing) And him probably forgettin' all about you!... Probably can't even call your name to mind. \nMARTIN (smiling) Laurie. \nAnd Laurie smiles triumphantly at her mother. \nMARTIN (continuing) But I fairly forgot just how pretty you was... \nLaurie grabs his hand then and pulls him indoors -- and there is no further resistance from Martin. \nMrs. Jorgensen and her husband converge then on Ethan -- and her face is gravely questioning. \nMRS. JORGENSEN The little one?... Debbie? \nEthan shakes his head. She squeezes his arm reassuringly and they start indoors. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. THE SPARE BEDROOM OF THE JORGENSEN'S - MED. SHOT - \nMARTIN - NIGHT \nThis is a room off the kitchen end of the keeping room -- \nand described in the book as the \"grandmother room\": with narrow, slit-like windows, a set of single bunk beds, possibly a fireplace. \nMartin is in a deep wooden tub, taking a hot bath, currying his back with a long-handled brush. Beyond him is the door. It opens and Martin turns casually -- and at once stops being casual as Laurie enters and purposefully crosses to a stool or bench on which his discarded clothing is scattered. \nMARTIN Hey... What you doin'...? \nShe picks up the shirt, puts it over one arm; she reaches for his long-handled and ragged underwear, runs a fist through a hole in its seat, clucks and shreds it into rags. During this: \nMARTIN (a yelp) Don't go takin' that stuff... \nLAURIE Ain't worth the mendin'... \nShe turns and looks at him, matter of fact. \nLAURIE What you gettin' red-in-the-face for?... I have brothers, haven't I? \n", "test1_true": "LAURIE I'm a woman, Martie... (he tries to say something but she goes right on) We wash and mend your dirty clothes all our lives... When you're little we even wash you... How a man can ever make out to get bashful in front of a woman I'll never know... \nMARTIN You talk like a feller might just as leave run around nekkid... \nLAURIE Wouldn't bother me... (she heads for the door) I wouldn't try it in front of pa, though, was I you... \nAnd she is laughing as she closes the door behind her. \nINT. THE KEEPING ROOM OF THE JORGENSEN HOUSE - FULL SHOT \nIt is a plastered room, everything bright and shiny; a big wood-burning cookstove, above it a row of shiny copper pots; the furniture handmade and probably not too much unlike the good plain Swedish modern of today. \nThere should be Scandinavian accents in the decor. All told, a cheerful, warm-smelling room. \nEthan is talking as Laurie enters the room still carrying Martin's shirt, the rags of his underwear. She will wait, listening for a break in what Ethan is saying, to try to get her mother's attention. Jorgensen is sitting in his usual chair -- with his boots off, puffing his pipe more or less in tune with what Ethan is talking about. Mrs. Jorgensen is in her rocker, darning or knitting. Ethan is standing near the mantel. \nETHAN ...an' then it snowed and we lost the trail... No need to tell ya all the places we went... Fort Richardson, Fort Wingate an' Cobb... the Anadarko Agency... Trouble is we don't even know which band that war party belonged to... \nMrs. Jorgensen looks up from her darning. \nMRS. JORGENSEN Well, you did all a body could, Ethan. \nETHAN I got your boy killed. \nMRS. JORGENSEN (gently) Don't go blamin' yourself... \nJORGENSEN (angrily) It's this country killed my boy!... Yes, by golly! \nMrs. Jorgensen stands. \nMRS. JORGENSEN Now Lars!... It so happens we be Texicans... We took a reachin' hold, way far out, past where any man has right or reason to hold on... Or if we didn't, our folks did... So we can't leave off without makin' them out to be fools, wastin' their lives 'n wasted in the way they died... A Texican's nothin' but a human man out on a limb... This year an' next and maybe for a hundred more.  But I don't think it'll be forever.  Someday this country will be a fine good place to be... Maybe it needs our bones in the ground before that time can come... \nThe speech impresses everyone but Laurie, who probably hasn't heard a word of it. \nLAURIE Ma!... Martie's drawers is a sight! Ain't fit for rags!... Would it be all right if we gave him some of Brad's things? \nThere is just the briefest hesitation... \nMRS. JORGENSEN Why...'course it would! They're in the chest... \nAnd she leads the way briskly, with Laurie following, to a big chest at the far end of the room. \nJORGENSEN (rising excitedly) By golly, the letter... In the chest, mama... It came for you, Ethan... last winter... \nEthan and Jorgensen cross together to where Mrs. Jorgensen is raising the top of a huge dower chest. She extracts a letter, wrapped in oilskin against moths. \nJORGENSEN (continuing) Joab Wilkes of the Rangers brought it... \nEthan takes the letter and studies it very carefully before venturing to open it. Jorgensen is quite curious, but trying not to seem nosy. The women remain at the chest -- pulling out various folded garments, etc. Finally Ethan carefully opens it and takes out a letter -- dirty as to paper, crudely printed in pencil and with a horseshoe nail pinning a two- inch square snip of calico to the bottom of the sheet. He reads the letter with the habitual difficulty of a man unused to words and then he turns the letter, removes the nail and looks at the snip of cloth. \nETHAN (quietly) Mrs. Jorgensen... \nShe comes to him, her arms piled with clothing; and \nLaurie a step behind her, holding up a new pair of long- handled underwear -- measuring it with her eyes for holes, etc. \nETHAN Will you look at this? \nHe holds out the snip of calico. \nMRS. JORGENSEN Why it's just a snip of calico... \nETHAN You ever see it before... like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore? \nMRS. JORGENSEN Yes!... Yes, I remember!... Have they found her, Ethan? \nETHAN No... not yet... \nHe takes the calico snip, places it within the letter and carefully pockets it. He looks broodingly into the fire. \nETHAN (continuing) ...not yet... \nLaurie's face is troubled as she turns from him and heads for the grandmother room, carrying the armful of clothes. \nINT. THE SPARE BEDROOM - FULL SHOT - NIGHT \nMartin is sitting sulkily on a cot, wrapped in a blanket. \nHe glares up as Laurie enters. His feet are in his boots. \nMARTIN Might at least have left me my pants! \nLAURIE Shush!... Time for bed anyway... (putting clothes near him) Likely these'll need some takin' in... Oh, Martie, you're that gaunted! ...Ma's havin' a turkey for dinner tomorrow and... \nJORGENSEN'S VOICE (calling) Laurie!... Come... come! \nEthan opens the door, enters. \nLAURIE Yes, Pa!... Good night, Martie... good night, Mr. Edwards... \nShe wants to kiss Martie but is shy in Ethan's presence and hurries out. \nMARTIN Good night... Laurie... \nETHAN Good night... \nMartin stoops to remove his boots. Ethan studies him and looks thoughtfully after the girl and at Martin. \nHe takes the letter out of his pocket -- as though he meant to read it -- and then he puts it back decisively. \nHe starts to undress. Martin lies back on his bunk. \n", "test1_id": 102, "test2_input": "ETHAN That camp you hit was Nawyecka Comanche... Chief Scar's bunch... \nCORRESPONDENT (fascinated) Scar? What a wonderful name!... \nGENERAL (to his aide) Are you getting this, Keefer? \nCORRESPONDENT (to Ethan) How do you spell that word -- Nawyecka? \nEthan ignores him, still facing the General. \nETHAN My name's Edwards... I'm looking for my niece... she was in that camp when you attacked... \nGENERAL (uncertain) Well... I know there were some captives recovered... \nMARTIN (bitterly) Four of 'em dead... so we were told... \nGENERAL (uncomfortably) Unfortunately, the hostiles murdered them as we developed the village... \nETHAN Are you sure they didn't die of carbine shots fired by a bunch o' Yank bluebellies so scared they couldn't tell the difference between a Cheyenne and a Comanche? \nGENERAL Keefer!... Put this man under arrest! \nETHAN That'll be the day... (scornfully) 'As we developed the village'... Next time you develop a village, hit it where the fightin' men are... You won't get any headlines for killin' squaws. \nKeefer coughs. \nKEEFER Shall I show him the captives, sir? \nGENERAL Just get him out of here! \nKEEFER Yes sir... (he crosses to Ethan) This way... \nINT. THE CHAPEL - MED. CLOSE SHOT - ANGLING TO DOOR - AFTERNOON \nThe door is opened by a guard and Ethan takes a step into the room -- then stops in manifest shock. Martin \nis at his heels, eager and expectant. Beyond them stands Keefer, grave and compassionate. There is a keening sound in the room -- almost an animal sound. \nINT. THE CHAPEL - REVERSE SHOT - FULL \nIt is a simple log-sided room with plank benches without backs. Up front is a small box-like pulpit, no altar. \nAcross the front of the room, set up either on benches or on boards over saw-horses are four blanket-covered figures -- at least two being the bodies of children. \nSquatting on the floor near them is an elderly white woman with hair hanging loosely down her back and clad in Indian robes. Standing, facing the newcomers, is a woman who may be no more than in her mid-thirties. \nShe is mad -- wild-eyed, frightened, with matted, unbrushed golden hair, torn garments. It is she who has been making the keening sound, the animal moans. Now she crouches at the sight of them and looks desperately for a means of escape. Two girls are asleep, heads together and backs to the door. One has light hair, like Debbie's; the other brown hair. The afternoon sun coming through a high window touches the light hair. \nMARTIN Debbie?... DEBBIE? \nHe has seen the light hair and starts crossing the room. \nNow the madwoman begins her screaming, running from side to side like a trapped animal. Ethan follows Martin into the room, Keefer behind him. Martin comes to a stop, realizing the woman is afraid of him. The two sleeping girls stir, but do not turn. \nMARTIN Don't be scared, ma'am... \nThe madwoman crouches behind one of the benches, looking at them with frightened eyes. \nKEEFER Just don't pay any attention to her... \nMartin swallows and nods and crosses to the light-haired girl. He reaches a hand gingerly to touch her shoulder. \nMARTIN (softly) Debbie? \nAt the touch, the girl is on her feet, crouching -- one hand, like a claw, drawn back to rake his face. She is unmistakably a white girl, but she is painted like a Comanche woman --her ears red inside, streaks of paint accenting the savagery of her face. Her eyes are frightened, yet full of hate. \nGIRL Pabo-taibo! (White man!) The other girl has risen almost in the same instant -- but more out of fear. She is younger, but painted like the other. She moves to stand behind the savage one. \nMARTIN (slowly) No... She's not... \nETHAN I ain't sure... Where's that doll? \nMartin stares at him, then realizes what he has in mind. \nHe fishes the rag doll from under his coat and holds it out to the girl. She looks at it... and we may almost suspect it is rekindling a memory -- but then she spits at it. The other girl laughs. Martin turns away and he's sick. \nKEEFER Was your niece about their age? \nETHAN Not far from it... \nKEEFER Hard to realize they're white, isn't it... \nETHAN (grimly) They're not white any more -- they're Comanche!... Let's see the bodies... \nMartin nerves himself for the ordeal, turns to follow. \nETHAN I don't need you... \nEthan and Keefer move away. As they do, the madwoman -- eyes fixed on the rag doll in Martin's hand -- begins creeping up behind him. Martin is torturedly watching Ethan and Keefer as first one blanket then another is raised -- we will never see the dead. During this: \nKEEFER (the dispassionate pro) I'd like you to see them all... It might help us identify them... Shot in the head -- flash-burn range... The boy got his skull cracked... Here's the girl... \nMartin stiffens, waiting. \nETHAN No... \nMartin relaxes... and in that instant the madwoman has the doll in her hands. She cradles it and she croons. \nMartin reaches to take it away. But she calmly sits, cradling the doll, and rocks to and fro, humming a lullaby. He can't take it. Ethan returns. \nETHAN Well, we only got the one lead -- Scar... And where we begin to look, I don't know... \n", "test2_true": "ETHAN Comancheros... \nKEEFER That's the breed... Course it might take time. \nETHAN Time's running out... But I'm obliged to you. \nThey leave. \nCUT TO: \nINT. JORGENSEN KEEPING ROOM - FULL SHOT - THE GROUP - EVENING \nLaurie has reached the last page of the letter, reading it by the lamp on the table. Jorgensen is knocking out the dead ashes of his pipe.  Charlie is in the shadows, a guitar in his hands -- not playing it, but occasionally softly picking a note or chord. Mrs. Jorgensen is dabbing moist eyes with a corner of her apron. \nLAURIE ...so we're setting out for New Mexico Territory in the morning... I am sorry I won't be back for Christmas again this year... \nShe swallows hard, pauses a moment in her reading. \nMRS. JORGENSEN (quick sympathy) And you knittin' that muffler... \nLAURIE (impatiently) What's the difference! \nMRS. JORGENSEN Well, I just thought it would be a sin and a shame not to let SOMEONE get some good of it... \nShe looks almost too obviously at Charlie, which annoys Laurie. Laurie resumes her letter reading: \nLAURIE (peering closely) There's a word crossed out... It looks like 'I wish' or 'I will'... (she gives up) Anyway... 'I set pen aside in the hope you are enjoying good health and your folks the same... I remain, respectfully... (forlornly) yours truly, Martin Paulie.' \nThat's all there is. Not a cross on it. Laurie just looks at it. Jorgensen stands, pocketing his pipe, easing the crick in his back. He ceremoniously removes the spectacles and replaces them on the mantel. \nJORGENSEN They never find that girl. \nLAURIE (half to herself) Yours truly... (hotly) And he even has to write his full name... Martin Pauley... not even just Martie!... (she stands) I don't care if he never comes back! \nShe heads for the front door. \nMRS. JORGENSEN (rising -- saying it without conviction) Now, Laurie!... \nCharlie hits the guitar a little stronger. Mrs. Jorgensen looks at him -- and the matchmaker is at work. \nMRS. JORGENSEN Charlie, you'll stay for supper?... Now I won't take no for an answer. \nCHARLIE Thought of saying 'no' never crossed my mind, Miz Jorgensen... No place I'd rather be than right here, right now. \nMrs. Jorgensen smiles and moves about her duties. Laurie has opened the door and is staring out wistfully... and Charlie begins playing and singing a verse from \"Skip to My Lou.\" \nCHARLIE (singing) One old boot and a button shoe One old boot and a button shoe... \nFADE OUT \nFADE IN \nEXT. DESERT COUNTRY - WIDE ANGLE - ETHAN AND MARTIN RIDING - DAY \nThe search theme is heard again as the two riders, with single pack horse, are heading south through New Mexico. \nIt is hot country. \nEXT. DESERT COUNTRY - CLOSE MOVING SHOT - ETHAN AND MARTIN - DAY \nTheir faces are sun-tanned, burned dark and dry. Gone are the heavy coats and clothing of their northern days. They do not speak, just ride -- and there is the same bleak, fanatic, hard look about them both. The music theme segues into something livelier and Mexican as we - \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. A MEXICAN VILLAGE - FULL SHOT - ETHAN AND MARTIN - DAY \nIt is a small place -- a single dirt street, a few adobe houses; a few racks of dried meat; a burro with a load of faggots on its back being driven along by a small boy; the music coming from a little cantina in the middle of the street. Before the cantina is a bone rack of a horse, without a saddle -- only a blanket pad. There is something familiar about the horse and Ethan is staring at it as they ride in. \nEXT. THE CANTINA - FULL SHOT - DAY \nThe two men dismount, beating dust out of their clothes. \nEthan takes another look at the sorry old nag tied outside. \nMartin pauses beside Ethan. \nETHAN Recognize it? \nMartin shakes his head. They start toward the cantina. \nETHAN There couldn't be two like that in all the world... \nINT. THE CANTINA - FULL SHOT - DAY \nas Ethan and Martin enter. It is a dirt-floored room with a small bar near the door, chairs and benches along the walls. A pair of guitar players are at the far end of the room. A couple of Mexicans are playing a noisy game of dominoes, slapping the dominoes down hard... EMILIO FIGUEROA, back to the door, spurred boots across one of the tables, is sipping a drink. Emilio is a cynical, middle-aged, aristocratic- looking man in modified charro costume. Watching the domino game is ESTRELLA, lithe, sensuous, smoking a brown-paper cigarette; she is barefoot. Behind the bar is the proprietor, dozing on his stool. Ethan takes a step into the room. \nETHAN (loudly) MOSE!.... MOSE HARPER? \nThe proprietor awakens. The domino game is suspended in mid- play. Estrella turns... and from beside Emilio, previously obscured by the man's back and the big charro hat, pokes the head of old Mose. Emilio turns then to look at the newcomers. \nMOSE Ay-eh...? \nHe is on his feet and advancing to meet them. As he recognizes them a wide, foolish grin splits his face and his mouth opens and closes in words that won't come out. He grabs and shakes Ethan's arm, then Martin's. \nETHAN Leggo my arm... You look mangier 'n ever. \nMOSE Ain't been too good... No sir, not too good... Gettin' old, Ethan... \nETHAN You were born old... \nPROPRIETOR (all smiles - as they head for the bar) Bienvenidos, senores... Pulque?... tequila?... mescal?... huiskey? \n", "test2_id": 103, "test3_input": "EXT. THE CAVE (MONUMENT) - FULL SHOT - THE TWO - DAY \nMartin pulls his horse in and swings off just as Ethan slides from his saddle. He runs toward one of the huge boulders, crouches and starts firing. \n175-D \nEXT. CANYON COUNTRY - WIDE ANGLE ON THE COMANCHES - DAY \nThe Comanches are spread out but coming on fast. One goes down under Martin's fire.... another is hit in the arm. He pulls up and the other Comanches wheel away from the hidden marksman. \n175-E \nEXT. THE CAVE - FULL SHOT - MARTIN AND ETHAN \nMartin runs back from his firing post toward where Ethan has fallen. \nETHAN (angrily) Go on! Get out of here while you can... \nMARTIN (pointing to the cave) Over there! \nEthan turns and sees what he means. He starts dragging himself to the cave as Martin grabs the rifles from their saddle scabbards, yanks off the water canteens and then drives their horses away. Then he too runs for the shelter of the cave. \n175-F \nEXT. THE CANYON - ANGLING FROM BEHIND MARTIN AND ETHAN \nBoth men are crouching, rifles ready. In the distance we see their horses running off -- pursued by some yelling Comanches. Four or six others come into sight, heading for the cave -- moving cautiously, uncertainly -- not seeing their quarry. Then the white men open fire and the Comanches bend low over their horses' necks and clear out of there. Ethan looks grimly at Martin. \nETHAN They'll be back... \nMARTIN We won't be here... Come on! \nHe gets an arm under Ethan and hauls him to his feet. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n175-G \nEXT. THE GAP IN THE CLIFF - PANNING SHOT - SUNSET \nCAMERA PANS from the top of the rock chimney to where Martin is snaking his way through, carrying newly-filled water canteens. He stands there, listening and looking back the way he has come; and then, satisfied there has been no pursuit, he continues away. \nOMITTED \nINT. THE CAVE - MED. SHOT - ETHAN - HALF-LIGHT \nEthan is lying on the hard earth, perhaps cushioned with some boughs. He is half delirious. A small fire is burning. \nMartin enters carrying the canteens. He looks unsympathetically toward Ethan, then continues to the fire, takes a knife and starts to sterilize it. Ethan gasps, mumbles and then a word comes clear. \nETHAN Martha... Martha! \nMartin stares at him -- and now, perhaps for the first time, he is fitting pieces into the jig-saw puzzle. He shifts closer to Ethan and we see he is preparing to dig out the bullet. Ethan opens his eyes and looks at him. \nMARTIN I gotta open that leg and let the poison out... \nHe poises the knife. \nETHAN Wait... \nHe fumbles in his shirt pocket, brings out a greasy folded piece of paper. \nETHAN Just in case... Read it. \nMartin sets the knife down, takes the paper, opens it and slowly reads: \nMARTIN 'I, Ethan Edwards, being of sound mind and without any blood kin, do hereby bequeath all my property of any kind to Martin Pauley...' (he stares, then) I don't want your property.... 'Sides, what do you mean no 'blood kin?' Debbie's your blood kin... \nETHAN Not no more. \nMARTIN (angrily) You can keep your will! (he thrusts it back into Ethan's shirt) I ain't forgettin' you was all set to shoot her yourself... What kind o' man are you, anyway. \nETHAN (sitting up -- eyes blazing) She's been with the bucks! She's nothin' now but a... \nMartin shoves him back onto the ground. \nMARTIN (a shout) Shut your dirty mouth! \nHe gets to his feet, trembling, and stands looking down at Ethan, his fists clenched at his sides and murder in his eyes. Then his eyes rove to the knife lying on the blanket. \nHe picks it up and he looks again at the wounded man. \nMARTIN (slowly) I hope you die! \nAnd he kneels again to open the wound. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. DESERT COUNTRY - FULL SHOT - ETHAN AND MARTIN - DAY \nMartin is hauling an improvised travois over the ground in which, lashed by vines and some clothing, is the unconscious figure of Ethan. \nCLOSE SHOT - MOVING - MARTIN - DAY \nEyes shadowed, whiskered, drawn -- he is an implacable figure as he drags the weary miles home. He hears a groan from Ethan o.s. He barely lets his eyes drift to the sound. He doesn't stop. \nCLOSE SHOT - MOVING - ETHAN IN THE TRAVOIS - DAY \nWe see he is delirious, lips parched, strapped to the poles. \nThe travois jolts over the ground. As he passes out of frame, the CAMERA HOLDS on the marks of the travois poles scraping across the desert. \n", "test3_true": "OMITTED \nFADE IN \nINT. JORGENSEN KEEPING ROOM - FULL SHOT - NIGHT \nA party is in progress. Fiddler and banjo-player are playing a lively square dance for one or two sets of dancers -- ranchers, their wives and daughters. Laurie is not in evidence. At the far end of the room is a table with a punch bowl set up and a cluster of men and women about. \nJorgensen is at the door boisterously welcoming some new arrivals. Leading them into the room is Captain the Reverend Sam Clayton, with a bulky oil-skin package under his arm. With him is Charlie MacCorry, dressed in his best black suit and scrubbed until he looks raw. \nBehind them come three or four other competent-looking men -- Rangers all of them. \nJORGENSEN (shouting) They're here, mama... Come in, come in... \nINT. JORGENSEN HOME - FULL SHOT - FAVORING GROUP AT DOOR \nClayton waits for Charlie to come abreast, then hits him on the back and drives him inside. \nCLAYTON Here he is, Lars... Combed, curried 'n washed behind the ears! \nMrs. Jorgensen hurries over, beaming, to admire Charlie. \nMRS. JORGENSEN Why, Charlie, you look real handsome! \nCHARLIE (grinning) Yes'm... scarcely reck'nize myself... Where's Laurie? \nMrs. Jorgensen smiles and playfully pushes him toward the guests. \nMRS. JORGENSEN You'll see her soon enough... \nClayton -- and the other Rangers -- have been hanging gunbelts on pegs along the wall. Now he shakes out his parcel -- disclosing a green-black frock coat. \nCLAYTON (nodding to the music) Say, that music sounds so good it must be sinful... \nMRS. JORGENSEN Grab a partner, reverend! \nCLAYTON Well, now, a man of my age just can't haul off and dance in cold blood... but if there's any of that wild cherry brandy of yours, Lars... \nJORGENSEN (suddenly sober) Nooo... (change of heart) Yah, by golly... One jug left... I get it! \nMrs. Jorgensen glares as he heads out. \nMRS. JORGENSEN Last winter that man swore up and down there wasn't a drop left -- and me with pneumoney!... Reverend, you'd better start clergyin' again! \nEXT. JORGENSEN HOME - FULL SHOT - NIGHT \nHorses, wagons fill the yard. We can hear the lively music of the square dance. As Jorgensen opens the door and sets out toward the barn, a battered dusty trap drives in -- and on it are Martin and Ethan. Jorgensen at first doesn't recognize them. \nJORGENSEN (hailing them) Hi!... You're late... hurry... \nAnd then he sees who they are, and his jaw drops. \nJORGENSEN (staring) Ethan... Martie... No, don't get down! ...You can't come in! \nThey stare at him. \nJORGENSEN The Rangers are here! \nHe says it as though that explains everything. \nETHAN What's that got to do with us? \nMARTIN (eyeing the house) What's goin' on? \nJORGENSEN (who's forgotten they wouldn't know) Why, my Laurie's getting married... \nMartin throws the reins aside and jumps out. Jorgensen grabs his arm. \nJORGENSEN Wait! Don't you hear me! The Rangers... \nMARTIN So what? \nJORGENSEN You been posted for murder... both of you... That trader fella, the late Mister Futterman... \nMartin tries to break free. \nMARTIN I gotta see Laurie! \nJORGENSEN (desperately) Go around the side... the grandmother's room... I'll tell her... PLEASE! \nMARTIN You better! \nHe heads around the side. Ethan meanwhile has climbed stiffly down, slightly favoring his leg. \nJORGENSEN Quick... hide in the barn, Ethan... \nETHAN Hide? Why would I? \nHe brushes past the little man and heads for the door. \nINT. THE JORGENSEN HOUSE - ANGLING FROM BEHIND ETHAN \nas he enters, with Jorgensen at his heels. For a moment, as he stands there, the party breezes on. Then first one, then another sees him. They gape, and the music falters and stops. Sam Clayton crosses to confront him across the width of the room. Jorgensen tries to be the easy, smiling host--and makes a very bad job of it. \nJORGENSEN Look everybody... Look who's... \nHe can't even finish it but stands there making flapping gestures. \nINT. JORGENSEN ROOM - FULL SHOT - ETHAN AND SAM \n-- others gaping.

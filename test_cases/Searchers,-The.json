Aaron drains his cup. \nAARON Ethan, countin' on you to look after things while I'm gone. \nEthan -- cup to his lips -- looks over its rim at Martha as Aaron starts to put on his shirt.

He's sworn in. \nETHAN (angrily) Well, swear him out again!...

Angrily Ethan whips out revolver and fires into the air. Then he swings his arm in a come-back gesture. He rides out ahead then a short distance and dismounts... and slowly the others follow. \nWe see now, the bodies of a few bulls stiffening in the sun. Ethan goes to the nearest one. A feathered lance is driven into it. He pulls the lance out. Mose comes over beside him. \nETHAN (angrily) Caddo or Kiowa, huh?...

Outside the little dog barks a welcome and presumably starts to follow the girl. Aaron reacts. \nAARON (hoarse whisper) Here dog... here! \nThe dog whines but obeys.

Then, with faintest little rustle, Debbie comes snaking along the ground into the hollow between the two graves and lies there face down, pressed against Topsy. She becomes one with the earth and the stillness. And then the moonlight strikes the tips of the scrub growth and as a cloud scuds by, the moonlight reveals something glittering -- like beads. And the CAMERA from that ground-level shot \nRAISES QUICKLY TO: \nCLOSE SHOT - FROM EXTREME LOW ANGLE - SCAR \nThe Comanche we are later to know as SCAR is painted for war -- tall, savage, mockingly looking down at what we know is the child's hiding place...

CLOSE SHOT - MARTIN - MOONLIGHT \nHe stands beside his spent and fallen horse. Its breathing is a rasping whistle. Martin tries to haul its head up. \nUseless. Breathing hard himself, his face ashen in the moonlight, Martin looks desperately off in the direction of the ranch. Then he jerks the rifle from its saddle scabbard -- struggling with it because it is under the horse. He freezes then -- listening... And we hear the steady beat of two horsemen approaching. Martin knows who they are and his face is alive with hope. He gets the rifle free at last and goes running toward the oncoming riders. \nMARTIN (shouting) Ethan!... Ethan! \nThe CAMERA SWINGS with him and we see Ethan and Mose approaching at the same steady gait. \nMARTIN (waving) Uncle Ethan... it's me... Martin! \nEthan doesn't slacken, nearly rides him down. \nETHAN Out of my way! \nMartin goes sprawling to his hands and knees. Mose continues without slowing. \nEXT.

YARD AND APPROACH TO EDWARDS HOUSE - WIDE ANGLE - NIGHT \n(NOTE TO W. HOCH: Here again that use of red is suggested.) \nThe ANGLE is past the porch uprights toward Mose and Ethan as they ride in. Little tongues of fire are licking the edges of the uprights. A few arrows, imbedded in the wood, are burning along their shafts. Beyond are the glowing ashes of the hayricks and the charred, smouldering rails of the corral. \nThere are no bodies in evidence... The red glow of the burning is on the faces of the men as they dismount. \nEthan strides to the porch, knocking away one of the blazing arrows as he heads to the door. He stops there -- and what he sees makes the big shoulders droop, the huge frame slump. \nSlowly then -- and removing his hat -- he goes in. Mose shuffles to the edge of the porch and squats there and rocks back and forth, his face working and crying soundlessly with senile grief. We hear a splintered door crash from its hinges within the room and Ethan's muffled voice calling through the house: \nETHAN (O.S.) Lucy?... Deborah? Lucy? \nHe strides back through the main room and out onto the porch just as Martin comes at a shambling run across the yard. \n", "test2_true": "ETHAN (harshly) You stay out! \nMartin tries to fight his arm free. \nETHAN Nothing for you to see. \nMARTIN Leggo... \nEthan turns him and drives a brutal right to his jaw. Martin goes down -- out cold. And only now do we understand how merciful the blow was as Ethan looks compassionately at the fallen figure. \nETHAN Don't let him go in there, Mose... \nAnd he takes off at a stumbling run for the hilltop. \nEXT. THE HILLOCK WITH THE TWO HEADBOARDS - FULL SHOT - ETHAN \nas he nears the graves. \nETHAN (calling) Lucy -- Lucy! \nHe runs in, looking around him. He sees the little dog, dead on the ground. And then he sees a shadowed something: \nThe shawl Debbie had worn. It is spread out, almost as though concealing a body. Fearfully he stoops and pulls it away... \nThere is nothing there, but the shawl. He drops to his knees, his head bowed, his face tortured. The moonlight is clear on the face of the nearer headboard. It is of weathered wood and the chiselled letters on it read: \nHERE LIES \nMARY JANE EDWARDS \nKILLED BY COMANCHES \nMAY 12, 1852 \na good WIFE & MOTHER In her 41st year \nSLOW DISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. THE HILLOCK - FULL SHOT - SLOWLY PANNING - DAWN LIGHT \nThe funeral is begun. In the foreground are three newly- \nmade crosses at the head of as many open graves -- which we need not see. With head bared, Sam Clayton is concluding his prayer. Near him stand the Jorgensen family: Mrs.  Jorgensen, Lars and LAURIE -- blonde, just beginning to reach her maturity -- and a stepping-stone of tow-headed children. \nCLAYTON ...and to Your keeping we commend the souls of Aaron... Martha... and Benjamin Edwards... \nMrs. Jorgensen and Laurie -- impelled by the same feminine sympathy and interest -- turn to look at Ethan and Martin. \nThe PANNING CAMERA picks them up...Ethan standing dry-eyed, looking at the grave of Martha; Martin -- with bruised lip -- looking out across the plain. \nClayton now opens his small, well-worn Bible to a marked page. \nCLAYTON Man that is born of woman is of few days and full of trouble... \nEthan looks at him, angrily, impatiently. \nCLAYTON He cometh forth like a... \nETHAN (harshly) Amen!... Put an 'amen' to it! \nCLAYTON ...like a flower and is cut down... Amen! \nETHAN ET AL. Amen! \nEthan turns on his heel and walks -- CAMERA PANNING -- to where Ed Nesby has been holding the horses. Brad is already mounting. Mose is there too and Charlie MacCorry.  Silhouetted against the dawn light are the rifles in each man's saddle scabbard. Clayton is right behind Ethan. \nCLAYTON Charlie--you and Brad ride point! ...Don't get too far ahead... \nThe young riders spur out. \nEXT. NEAR HILLOCK - MED. CLOSE SHOT - ETHAN AND MRS. JORGENSEN \nEthan is about to mount when Mrs. Jorgensen comes up and catches his arm. \nMRS. JORGENSEN Ethan... (he turns impatiently) Those girls mean as much to me as though they were my own... Maybe you don't know my Brad's been sittin' up with Lucy... and my Laurie's real fond of Martin... \nEthan glances back at where Martin and Laurie are standing. \nANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING LAURIE AND MARTIN \nThe girl is looking at Martin full of compassion, tries to console him by taking his arm and squeezing it as he stares blindly at the graves and Jorgensen stolidly beginning the work of shovelling them full. \nEXT. NEAR HILLOCK - ETHAN AND MRS. JORGENSEN AS BEFORE \nEthan looks back at her -- stone-faced. \nETHAN (impatiently) I'd be obliged if you'd get to the point, ma'am. \nMRS. JORGENSEN I am... I am... It's just that I know Martha'd want you to think of her boys as well as her girls... And if the girls are... dead... Ethan, don't let the boys waste their lives in vengeance! \nEthan shrugs his arm free and mounts. \nMRS. JORGENSEN Promise me, Ethan! \nHe ignores her and turns angrily to where Martin is. \nETHAN (harshly) Come on, if you're comin'... \nHe digs spurs and rides out with the others. Martin comes over, with Laurie a step behind. His face is set, his eyes almost unseeing. \nMRS. JORGENSEN (a heartbroken murmur) Oh, Martin... Martin... \n", "test2_id": 103, "test3_input": "ETHAN Jorgensen's been runnin' his cattle with my own... \nMARTIN (staring) YOUR cattle?...

CLOSE SHOT - LAURIE - DAWN LIGHT \nShe is in a robe made of an Indian blanket, belted snugly around her waist. She wears moccasins for slippers. Her flannel nightgown is high at the collar and almost trails the floor. She is at the stove, frying bacon and eggs; a coffee pot is on the boil. Beyond her the door to the grandmother room opens and Martin comes in -- dressed in Brad's clothes. His eyes whip around the room. Laurie doesn't turn as he slowly approaches. \nLAURIE (quietly) Ethan rode on... an hour ago. \nThe starch goes out of him. He walks heavily to the table and sits, slumped. She looks at him compassionately. \nLAURIE I don't know what you can do about finding Debbie that he can't... \nHe just shakes his head, not looking at her. She lifts the food from the skillet onto a plate and sets it before him. \nLAURIE He'll find her now, Martie... Please believe me... I know. \nHe shakes his head. She crosses to the stove for the coffee pot. \nMARTIN That's what scares me -- him findin' her. \nNow it is her turn to stare. \nMARTIN Laurie, I've seen his eyes when he so much as hears the word 'Comanche' ...I've seen him take his knife an' ...never mind... But he's a man can go crazy wild... It might come on him when it was the worst thing could be... What I counted on, I hoped to be there to stop him, if such thing come. \nLaurie has poured his coffee. Now he sips it. She sits at the table with him. \nLAURIE (slowly) I hoped I could hold you here... But I guess I knew... So I stole this for you... \nShe takes Ethan's letter from her breast and hands it to him. He takes it, puzzled, and slowly reads it aloud. \nMARTIN 'I bought a small size dress off a Injun... If this here is a piece of yr chiles dress bring reward. I know where they gone...

JORGENSEN KEEPING ROOM - FULL SHOT - EARLY MORNING \nMrs. Jorgensen quietly enters the room and sees Laurie with head pressed against the door. She wants to offer some word of sympathy, but doesn't know what to say. She crosses to the stove to pour herself a cup of coffee. Then we hear the drum of horses' hooves, the sound of Martin riding away. Laurie flings open the door, almost as though to call him back. \n113-B \nEXT.

FUTTERMAN, TRADER' \nThere are adjacent outbuildings and corral. Four horses are tied outside, two being pack animals. A surly-looking white man or breed sits in a stool tilted back near the door, whittling with a long-bladed knife, eyeing the horses covetously. He glances aside and glares as a squaw shuffles along bearing a clumsy load of faggots on her bowed back. \nMAN Andale! Andale! \nFearfully she quickens her step. The man gets up, shoves knife into belt and heads into the post. \nINT. FUTTERMAN'S TRADING POST - FULL SHOT - DAY \nIt is a grimy establishment with some dusty trade goods on shelves; a counter which serves as a bar; a few plank tables and benches. \nThe breed seen outside enters and crosses to a side table where another mean-looking hombre sits preparing to play a game of solitaire with a deck of limp cards. \nEthan and Martin are at a table in the center of the room, examining a dirty, rumpled child's dress -- Debbie's. \nMartin nods soberly in answer to Ethan's inquiring look; yes, it's hers. Both look up as FUTTERMAN crosses from the bar, carrying a whisky jug and two dirty glasses -- his fingers thrust inside the glasses. Futterman is a squaw man and a killer -- dead eyes in a white face. \nFUTTERMAN Drink? \nHe sets the jug down, picks up one of the glasses -- so grey and thumb-printed it is almost opaque. Both Ethan and Martin regard it with disgust. Futterman gives a slight shrug, takes the dress and starts to wipe the dirty glass with it. Martin snatches it out of his hand. \nETHAN (harshly) How'd you come by this? \nFUTTERMAN You said there'd be a thousand dollar reward. \nETHAN That's what I said. \nFUTTERMAN You got it with you? \nEthan looks at him and beyond toward the two men. \nINT.

I laid out for the dress an' sendin' you the writin'... \nHe tilts the jug to his mouth as Ethan reaches for his heavy leather pouch. Futterman watches greedily as Ethan lets a gold piece slide out. He tosses it onto the table. \nETHAN Twenty Yankee dollars. \nFutterman puts the jug down. His hand inches -- as though pulled by a magnet -- toward the gold piece. \nFUTTERMAN ...an' a man's time is worth somethin'... \nEthan's big hand clamps over Futterman's and he starts squeezing as a man would squeeze a lemon. Futterman's lips whiten. \nETHAN Talk! \nFUTTERMAN A young buck fetched it in late last summer... (Ethan eases the grip) Said it belonged to a captive chile of Chief Scar... \nETHAN Scar? Never heard of any Chief Scar. \nFUTTERMAN Me neither... But this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the Nawyecky Comanches. \nETHAN Keep talking. \nFUTTERMAN Scar's band was headin' north... to winter in at Fort Wingate... eatin' agency beef. That's what this buck said... Maybe he lied. \nETHAN And maybe you lie... \nFUTTERMAN In that case you won't find her -- and I won't get my thousand dollars. \nEthan stands. Martin follows. Martin takes the dress and folds it carefully. \nFUTTERMAN (too casually) Stay the night if you want... (Ethan shakes his head) Cards?... A jug?... If you'd like some company, we got a few squaws on the place... \nEthan and Martin head for the door. \nETHAN No thanks. \nThe two plug-uglies stand -- mean ready to do their master's bidding. \nFUTTERMAN Don't forget to come back with my thousand dollars. \nETHAN Ain't yours yet. \nThey leave.

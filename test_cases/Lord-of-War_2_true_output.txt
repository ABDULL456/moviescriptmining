Row after row of tanks, armored personnel carriers and helicopter gunships in mothballs. 
YURI (V.O.) Helicopters, torpedo boats, armored personnel carriers, whole tank divisions. 
DMITRI, flask in hand, and YURI are given a tour of the surplus hardware by one of Dmitri's brother officers. 
UKRAINE MAJOR (haggling over the gunships) --I'll tell you what I'll do.  Buy six, you get one free. 
YURI What about tech support? 
UKRAINE MAJOR No problem. 
Yuri and Dmitri come upon an oily-faced BOY, perched on the cockpit of a helicopter gunship - he wears an ill-fitting uniform, several sizes too big. 
YURI Son, get off there before you get hurt. 
UKRAINE MAJOR (sheepish) He's the tech support. 
YURI (incredulous) He's twelve. 
UKRAINE MAJOR Thirteen.  Almost fourteen. 
DMITRI (shrug) Kids grow up fast around here. 
UKRAINE MAJOR (nodding to the gunship) He can take it apart in his sleep. 
Yuri shrugs, shakes the Major's hand. 
EXT.  HILL OVERLOOKING ODESSA HARBOR.  DAY. 
THE POV FROM A PAIR OF BINOCULARS - in the crosshairs, JACK VALENTINE, at a surprise checkpoint, staring through binoculars of his own. 
YURI (O.C.) Who are you? 
YURI, on his belly to avoid detection, slithers back to the roadway - hands the binoculars to a YOUNG SOLDIER. 
DMITRI stands beside the convoy of trucks parked barely out of view of the checkpoint, including Yuri's Mercedes and a huge open-bed tractor-trailer carrying a Russian Hind helicopter gunship. 
YURI (cont'd) (angrily to Dmitri) I thought we were supposed to be watching for these checkpoints. 
DMITRI How can I?  You keep selling my helicopters. You're too greedy, Yuri. 
YURI (anxious) We have to go back. 
Dmitri regards the trucks, each one longer than the road is wide. 
DMITRI We'll be going in reverse.  We can't turn around for a mile. 
The YOUNG SOLDIER on lookout calls to them. 
YOUNG SOLDIER They're coming. 
Yuri grabs the binoculars.  Sure enough, Valentine and his agents are climbing into their Interpol Jeeps and driving towards them. 
DMITRI We shoot it out? 
YURI (shaking his head) And start an international fucking incident - no, no, no. 
DMITRI So we run. 
YURI No.  I've got paperwork. 
DMITRI (protesting) Not for the gunship.  Yuri, you know the penalty for sanction-busting - selling a military helicopter? 
Yuri gazes at the Russian Mi-24V helicopter gunship, bristling with armaments. 
YURI It's not a military helicopter.  It's a rescue helicopter. 
Yuri turns to the Boy referred to as "tech support". 
YURI (cant' d) Get to work, Son. 
The boy pulls a wrench from his pocket. 
SEVERAL MINUTES LATER 
The Interpol Jeeps crest the rise and pull in front of the convoy - VALENTINE and his agents exit, guns drawn. 
DMITRI and the UKRAINIAN SOLDIERS stiffen, their weapons also at the ready.  An uneasy stand-off. 
YURI gestures for calm.  He greets Valentine warmly - offers his hand. 
YURI Yuri Orlov. 
In reply, an Interpol Agent unceremoniously slams Yuri into the side of his truck. 
VALENTINE (flashing ID) Papers. 
Again Yuri waves off Dmitri and his men, about to come to his aid. Yuri courteously hands over his passport and other documentation to the skeptical Valentine. 
VALENTINE (cont'd) (regarding the photo closely) Mr. Orlov, always in the wrong place at the right time.  We've met before.  Off the coast of Colombia. (feigning memory loss) What was the name of that freighter - I can't remember.  Was it the Kono or the Kristol?

Because he doesn't care anymore. Because it's all he deserves anyway... 
And in that moment, in reaching his lowest point, JAMES has unwittingly stumbled on the one thing that gives him an advantage over everyone else... 
The fact that he doesn't care. The fact that death has become an option. The fact that there is no risk he is not prepared to take... 
So every corner is tighter, every braking point later, every gap is an opening, no matter how tiny...

126AEXT. BRITISH GRAND PRIX - 18TH JULY 1976- DAY                 126A 
NIKI's car is pursued by JAMES's. They disappear behind a copse of trees. Out of sight. 
When they re-emerge, JAMES is ahead of NIKI, having overtaken him - to the delight of the partisan crowd. 
The chequered flag waves again as JAMES's car roars across the finish line... 
CAPTION: "RACE 8. HUNT WINS. LAUDA 2nd." 
JAMES screams in catharsis and triumph. Teeth clenched. Eyes wide and staring with concentration.

JAMES, TEDDY MAYER, ALASTAIR CALDWELL, and all the MECHANICS are watching on TV...

131 EXT. BRAND'S HATCH - PRESS TENT - DAY                          131 
A crowded PRESS room. In opposite corners of the room, JAMES and NIKI are giving interviews to different PRESS and TV journalists. Stirling Moss is talking to JAMES... 
STIRLING MOSS ...James, a few weeks ago, you were out of the running for this season completely, now you're right back in it. What's changed...? 
Screaming GIRLS in the background, shouting "James, we love you." JAMES stares across the room at NIKI... 
JAMES A combination of factors, not all of which I'm prepared to discuss here. Justice being done re: the disqualification in Spain helps, and having my old car back of course... 
In the other corner: NIKI is doing his interviews in German, (we see sub-titles)...

JOURNALIST Mathematically in theory it's now possible for Hunt to catch you. Are you worried? 
NIKI Not at all. For him to catch me, he'd have to win all the remaining races, and I'd have to lose them. And pigs would have to fly. 
Laughter among the confident GERMANS. 
NIKI Now if you'll excuse me, I have a private family matter to attend to. 
NIKI takes MARLENE's hand, and leads her away.

NIKI and MARLENE get married. In stark contrast to JAMES's wedding...it's a small, intimate affair. Modest. Not showy. Away from the cameras. Just them. And a witness from the pub.

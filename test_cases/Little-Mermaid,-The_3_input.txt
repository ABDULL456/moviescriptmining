Eric: Come here boy! . . . Arrr . . . (He sees Ariel and waves. She is emb- arassed and goes back inside.) Sebastian: This has got to be, without a doubt, the single most humiliating day of my life.  I hope you appreciate what I go through for you, young lady. Now - we got to make a plan to get that boy to kiss you.  Tomorrow, when he takes you for that ride, you gotta look your best.  You gotta bat your eyes - like this.  You gotta pucker up your lips - like this. (He sees she is asleep.) Hm. You are hopeless child. You know dat? Completely hopeless . . . 
(Fade to undersea palace. Seahorse swims up to Triton.)

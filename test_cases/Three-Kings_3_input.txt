SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION -- Vig is hit in the collar bone, ONLY THE SOUND OF THE BULLET SMASHING HIS FLESH AND BONE. He is jerked, falls to his knees, but gets up, keeps staggering toward Troy, 125 yards away. 
Troy looks stunned. 
Archie turns sharply to his right and FIRES a rifle. 
An IRAQI SOLDIER, 150 yards to the side, drops to the ground as Archie and Doc continue to hit him with gunfire. 
Troy runs as hard as he can toward Vig. 
ARCHIE GATES Cover him. 
Doc looks around frantically with his pistol pointed. Archie scans the area and directs 3 SHIITE RIFLEMEN to spread out. 
ARCHIE GATES Lock it down. Shoot anything that moves. 
IMAM (translates) Haza janav yasat. 
Troy runs, catches the staggering Vig in his arms and embraces him. Blood runs from Vig's mouth, onto Troy's shoulder, as Vig tries to talk. 
VIG You made it, man -- 
Troy cries as he runs with Vig in his arms. 
TROY Help him. 
Doc takes Vig from Troy's arms and carefully lays him on the ground, cradling his head in his lap. Vig spits blood. 
VIG What happened to the Jesus fire, Doc? 
DOC It's around you right now, man, it works on this side or the other side. 
VIG You never told me that part. I guess I could go to one of them shrines that erase the bad you did -- 
TROY We made the right choice today, Conrad. 
VIG We did good, right? 
TROY We made the right choice. 
The hole in Vig's collar bone is pumping out blood. Troy puts his hands over it. Doc looks sad and scared as he tries to turns Vig's head to help him breathe. 
DOC Dear Lord watch over this man, help him if you can. Our father who art in heaven -- 
50 Shiites -- children and adults -- sit on the ground near the bunker watch from afar. 
Troy stands up looking around helplessly. 
TROY Help. 
DOC -- hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done -- 
A gunshot rings out and -- slightly slow motion -- hits Troy in the lower right chest -- and comes out again three inches over, piercing a thin piece of his side -- with only the sound of tearing tissue. Troy looks stunned as he is spun around by the shot. 
Archie spins around in the desert and looks at Troy. 
ARCHIE GATES Goddamn it. 
He runs hard across the desert toward Troy. 
Troy falls next to Vig and they look at each other. 
Troy's eyes are wide with pain as he breathes with great difficulty -- RASPING. 
INT. TROY'S RIB CAGE 
His breathing creates an air pocket, crushing his organs to the left side. 
TROY'S POV 
looking up at Doc, who is saying something to Troy, but there's NO SOUND EXCEPT TROY'S LABORED BREATHING 
The POV turns to the side -- Vig is no longer breathing. 
FLASHBACK TO THE OPENING SCENE, but with weird, MUFFLED SOUND 
SOLDIER #5 Take my picture. 
VIG Do you still want to sell pictures? 
TROY (distracted monotone) For twenty. 
SOLDIER #5 Twenty bucks? 
VIG War's been over five days, ain't gonna be any more of this, Jim. 
SOLDIER #5 Twenty dollars, man, what's the meaning of life? 
TROY You're lucky you got to see anybody shot in this war. 
SOLDIER #5 Bobby, take my picture. 
He holds the camera out. 
SOLDIER #4 If he shot the guy, it's up to him. 
SOLDIER #5 It's not like he shot a fucking deer. It's the enemy. 
VIG It's Troy's enemy, yours for twenty. 
BACK TO THE SCENE - CLOSE UP 
Troy lies on the ground, trying to breathe, eyes wide.

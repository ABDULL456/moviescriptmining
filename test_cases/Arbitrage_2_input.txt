BRYER Nah, they're all dead. 
FLORES (READING) So he's a good student, magnet school, whatever. (MORE) Goldenrod - 4.17.11 59. FLORES (CONT'D) Then his mom dies and he gets popped for gun possession. Even so, how come he got probation? 
BRYER Well, he had an excellent lawyer. 
FLORES (READING CLOSER) How the fuck does this kid afford Felder and Chausse...? 
Mills drops another FOLDER on the table. 
BRYER We pulled his parents' tax returns. Guess where his father worked for twenty years? 
FLORES (READING) Miller Capital? (READING) He was the fucking driver?! (LAUGHS) Wow, this guy's good... 
He puts down the sheet and leans back. 
FLORES (CONT'D) Where are you at with the kid? 
MILLS So far he won't budge. 
FLORES Well he's a convicted felon. Go get a warrant, put him in front of a grand jury. Let's see how long he holds out when he realizes he's looking at ten years off the prior. 
INT. FREMAUT - VOGLER'S OFFICE HALLWAY - LATER 
Robert storms the hallway, passing a waiting SECRETARY. 
SECRETARY I'm sorry, Mr. Miller, as I explained from downstairs, he's on a call right now, and he said... 
He brushes past her. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 60. 
SECRETARY (CONT'D) Mr. Miller! 
INT. VOGLER'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Robert enters, locking the door behind him. Chris bolts up. 
CHRIS What the fuck...? 
ROBERT Tell me what is going on. 
Robert comes closer. Chris is freaking out. 
CHRIS I can't. 
ROBERT Tell me what's going on! 
CHRIS I can't! 
Robert GRABS Chris by the collar. 
ROBERT Why not?! 
CHRIS It's not me! 
ROBERT What do you mean it's not...? 
CHRIS THE AUDIT PASSED! 
ROBERT (slackening his grip) The audit passed? What do you mean the audit passed? 
CHRIS It passed! It passed a week ago! Like I said. Everything's fine! We confirmed the money, it's all straight and done. 
ROBERT (BEYOND CONFUSED) Then... why did you tell me that it didn't? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 61. 
CHRIS Because they asked me to hold it. 
ROBERT They? Who's they? (thrashes him again) Who is they?! 
CHRIS Mayfield. 
ROBERT (TO HIMSELF) Mayfield? 
Robert thinks... and starts LAUGHING. Chris looks at him strangely as he walks out.
